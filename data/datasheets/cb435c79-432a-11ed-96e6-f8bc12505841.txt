D0 is the least significant data bit. \nUnused data inputs are connected to either the regular printed circuit board (PCB) power or ground plane. Data \ninputs are red, green, or blue pixel inputs.  \n10, 17 V AA Analog Power Supply (5 V ± 5%). All V AA pins on the ADV7127 must be connected. \n11 PDOWN  Power-Down Control Pin. The ADV7127 completely powers down, including the voltage reference circuit, when \nPDOWN  is low. \n12, 13 DNC Do Not Connect. Do not connect to these pins.  \n14 CLOCK Clock Input (TTL-Compatible). The rising edge of CLOCK latches D0 to D9 where D0 to D9 can be red, green, or blue pixel data inputs (TTL-compatible). CLOCK is typically the pixel clock rate of the video system. CLOCK is driven \nby a dedicated TTL buffer. \n15, 16 GND Ground. All GND pins must be connected. \n18 IOUT Differential Current Output. This pin is capable of direct ly driving a doubly terminated 75 Ω load. If not required, \nthis output is tied to ground. \n19 I OUT Current Output. This high impedance curr ent source is capable of directly dr iving a doubly terminated 75 Ω coaxial \ncable. \n20 COMP Compensation Pin. COMP is a compensation pin for the internal reference amplifier. A 0.1 μF ceramic capacitor must be connected between COMP and V\nAA. \n21 V REF Voltage Reference Input. An external 1.23 V voltage reference must be connected to this pin. The use of an external resistor divider network is not recommended. A 0.1 μF decoupling ceramic capacitor is connected between V\nREF \nand V AA. \n22 R SET Full-Scale Adjust Control. A resistor (R SET) connected between this pin and GND controls the magnitude of the full-\nscale video signal. Note that the IRE relationships are maintained, regardless of the full-scale output current. The \nrelationship between R SET and the full-scale output current on I OUT is given by I OUT (mA) = 7968 × V REF (V)/R SET (Ω). \n23 PSAVE  Power Save Control Pin. The device is put into standby mode when PSAVE  is low. The internal voltage reference \ncircuit is still active. \n \nData Sheet  ADV7127  \n \nRev.

A | Page 13 of 18 TERMINOLOGY  \nColor Video (RGB)  \nColor video (RGB) usually refers to the technique of combining \nthe three primary colors of red, green , and blue to produce color  \npictures within the usual spectrum. In  RGB monitors, three DACs  \nare required, one for each color.  \nGray Scale  \nGray s cale is the discrete levels of video signal between the \nreference black and reference white levels. A 10 -bit DAC \ncontains 1024 different levels, whereas an 8-bit DAC contains 256.  \nRaster Scan  \nRaster s can is t he most basic method of sweeping a CRT  one \nline at a time to generate and display images.  Reference Black Level  \nReference black l evel is t he maximum negative polarity \namplitude of the video signal.  \nReference White Level  \nReferen ce white l evel is the  maximum positive polarity \namplitude of the video signal.  \nVideo Signal  \nVideo s ignal is the portion of the composite video signal that varies \nin gray scale levels between reference white and reference black. \nIt is also r eferre d to as th e picture signal, which is the portion \nthat can be visually  observed.  \n \n \n \nADV7127  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. A | Page 14 of 18 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADV7127 contains one 10 -bit DAC , with one input \nchannel containing a 10 -bit register. A reference amplifier is \nalso integrated on board the device . \nDIGITAL INPUTS  \nTen bits  of data (color information), D0 to D9, are latched into \nthe device on the rising edge of each  clock cycle. This data is \npresented to the 10 -bit DAC and is then converte d to an analog \noutput waveform (s ee Figure 22). \nCLOCK\nDATA\nANALOG OUTPUTS\nIOUT, IOUTDIGITAL INPUTS\nD0 TO D9\n14959-023 \nFigure 22. Video Data Input/Output  \nAll of these digital inputs are specified to accept TTL logic levels.  \nCLOCK INPUT  \nThe CLOCK input of the ADV7127 is typically the pixel clock \nrate of the system. It is also known as the dot rate. The dot rate, \nand therefore  the required CLOCK frequency, is  determined by \nthe onscreen resolution, according to the following equation:  \nDot Rate  = (Horiz ontal  Resolution  × Vert ical Resolution  × \nRefresh Rate) /Retrace Factor  \nwhere:  \nHoriz ontal  Resolution  is the number of pixels  per line. \nVer tical Resolution  is the number of lines  per frame.  \nRefresh Rate  is the horizontal  scan r ate at which the screen must \nbe refreshed, typically 60 Hz f or a noninterlaced system or \n30 Hz for an interlaced system.  \nRetrace Factor  is the total blank time f actor, which takes into  \naccount that  the display is blanked for a certain fraction of the \ntotal duration of each frame (for example , 0.8). \nIf there is  a graphics system with a 1024 × 1024 resolution, a \nnoninterlaced  60 Hz refresh rate , and a retrace factor of 0.8, then  \nDot Rate  = (1024 × 1024 × 60)/ 0.8 = 78.6 MHz  \nThe required CLOCK frequency is  78.6 MHz.  \nAll video data and control inputs are latched into the ADV7127 on \nthe rising edge of CLOCK,  as previously described in the Digital \nInputs  section. It is recommended that the CLOCK input to the \nADV7127 be driv en by a TTL buffer (for example , 74F244).  IOUT\nmA V\n17.61 0.66\n0 0 BLACK\nLEVELWHITE\nLEVEL\n100 IRE\n14959-024 \nFigure 23.

The V REF pin \nis normally terminated to V AA through a 0.1 µ F capacitor. \nAlternatively, the device can, if required, be overdriven by an \nexternal 1.23 V reference ( AD1580).  \nA resistance R SET connected between the RSET pin and the GND \npin determines the amplitude of the output video level according  to \nthe following equation:  \nIOUT (mA) = ( 7968 × V REF (V))/RSET (Ω) \nUsing a variable value of R SET allows accurate adjustment of the \nanalog output video levels. Use of a fixed 560 Ω RSET resistor \nyields the analog output levels quoted in Specifications  section. \nThese  values typically correspond to the  RS-343A video \nwaveform values shown in Figure 23. \nDIGITAL -TO-ANALOG CONVERTER  \nThe ADV7127  contains a 10 -bit DAC . The DAC is designed using \nan advanced, high speed, segmented architec ture. The bit currents \ncorresponding to each digital input are routed to e ither the analog \noutput (bit = 1) or GND (bit = 0) by a sophisticated decoding \nscheme. The use of identical current sources in a monolithic design guarantees monotonicity and low glitch. T he on -board operational \namplifier stabilizes the full -scale output current against temperature \nand power supply variations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet ADV7127\n \nRev. A | Page 15 of 18 ANALOG OUTPUT \nThe analog output of the ADV7127  is a high impedance current \nsource. The current output is capable of directly driving a 37.5 Ω \nload, such as a doubly terminated 75 Ω coaxial cable. Figure 24 shows the required configuration for the output connected into \na doubly terminated 75 Ω load.

Analog Output Termination for RS-170 \n \n  More detailed information regarding load terminations for \nvarious output configurations, including RS-343A and RS-170, is available in the AN-205 Application Note , Video Formats and \nRequired Load Terminations . \nFigure 23 shows the video waveforms associated with the current output driving the doubly terminated 75 Ω load of \nFigure 24. \nGRAY SCALE OPERATION \nThe ADV7127  can be used for standalone, gray scale (mono- \nchrome), or composite video applications (that is, only one channel used for video information). \nVIDEO OUTPUT BUFFER \nThe ADV7127  is specified to drive transmission line loads, which is \nwhat most monitors are rated as. The analog output configurations \nto drive such loads are shown in Figure 26. However, in some \napplications, it may be required to drive long transmission line cable lengths. Cable lengths greater than 10 meters can attenuate and distort high frequency analog output pulses. The inclusion of the output buffers compensates for some cable distortion. Buffers \nwith large full power bandwidths and gains between two and four \nare required. These buffers need to be able to supply sufficient current over the complete output voltage swing. Analog Devices, Inc., produces a range of suitable op amps for such applications. These include the AD843/ AD844 /AD847 series of monolithic op \namps. In very high frequency applications (80 MHz), the AD8061  \nis recommended. More information on line driver buffering \ncircuits is given in the relevant op amp data sheets. \nUse of buffer amplifiers also allows implementation of other video \nstandards besides RS-343A and RS-170. Altering the gain \ncomponents of the buffer circuit results in any desired video level.  \nAD8480.1µF\nIOUTZ1 Z2\nZO = 75Ω\n(CABLE)\nZS = 75Ω\n(SOURCE\nTERMINATION)ZL = 75Ω\n(MONITOR)DAC75Ω\n–VS+VS\n0.1µF\nGAIN (G) = 1 +Z1\nZ2\n14959-027 \nFigure 26.

A | Page 16 of 18 PCB  LAYOUT CONSIDERATION S \nThe ADV7127 is optimally de signed for lowest noise perfor -\nmance, both radiated and conducted noise. To complement the \nexcellent noise performance of the ADV7127, it is imperative \nthat great car e be given to the PCB layout. Figure 27 shows a \nrecommended connection diagram for the ADV7127. \nThe PCB layout is optimized for lowest noise on the ADV7127 \npower and groun d lines. Radiated and conducted noise can be \nachieved by shielding the digital inputs and providing good \ndecoupling. The lead length between groups of V AA and GND \npins is minimized to  inductive ringing.  \nGROUND PLANES  \nThe ADV7127 and asso ciated analog circuitry have a separate \nground plane referred to as the analog ground plane. This \nground plane connect s to the regular PCB ground plane at a \nsingle point through a ferrite bead, as illustrated in Figure 27. \nThe ferrite bead is  located as close as possible (within 3 inches) \nto the ADV7127.  \nThe analog ground plane encompass es all ADV7127 ground \npins, voltage reference circuitry, power supply bypass circuitry, \nthe analog output traces , and any output amplifiers.  The regula r \nPCB ground plane area encompass es all the digital signal traces, \nexcluding the ground pins, leading up to the ADV7127. \nPOWER PLANES  \nThe PCB layout has two distinct power planes: one for analog  \ncircuitry and one for digital circuitr y. The analog power plane  \nencompass es the ADV7127 (V AA) and all associated analog \ncircuitry. This power plane is con nected to the regular PCB \npower plane ( VCC) at a single point through a ferrite bead, as \nillustrated in Figure 27. This bead is l ocated within 3  inches of \nthe ADV7127.  \nThe PCB power plane provide s power to all digita l logic on the \nPCB , and  the analog power plane p rovide s power to all \nADV7127 power pins, voltage reference circuitry , and any \noutput amplifiers.  The PCB power and ground planes do not \noverlay portions of the analog power plane. Keeping the PCB \npower and ground planes from overlay ing the analog power \nplane contribute s to a reduction in plane  to plane noise \ncoupling.  \n \n \n \n SUPPLY DECOUPLING  \nNoise on the analog power plane can be further reduced by the \nuse of multiple decoupling capacitors (see Figure 27). \nOptimum performance is achieved  by the use of 0.1 µ F ceramic \ncapacitors. Each of the two groups of V AA is individually \ndeco upled to ground. The VAA pins ( Pin 10 and Pin 17) must be \ndecoupled with capacitors to GND.  Decouple the pins  by \nplacing the capacitors as close as possible to the device with the \ncapacitor leads as short as possible  between  the VAA and GND \npins, thus minimizing lead inductance.  \nIt is important to note that while the ADV7127 contains \ncircuitry to reject power supply noise, this rejection decreases with frequency. If a high frequency switching power sup ply is \nused, the designer must  pay close attention to reducing power \nsupply noise. A dc power sup ply filter (Murata BNX002) \nprovide s an electromagnetic interface ( EMI ) suppression \nbetween the switching power supply and the main PCB. \nAlter natively, consider  using a 3 -terminal voltage regulator.  \nDIGITAL SIGNAL INTER CONNECT \nThe digital signal lines to the ADV7127 must  be isolated as \nmuch as possible from the analog outputs and other analog \ncircuit ry. Digital signal lines must not overlay the analog power \nplane.  \nDue to the high clock rates used, long clock lines to the ADV7127 must be avoided to minimize noise pickup.  \nAny active pull -up termination resistors for the digital inputs \nare connected to the regular PCB power plane (V\nCC) and not the \nanalog power plane. \nANALOG SIGNAL INTERCO NNECT \nThe ADV7127 is located as close as possib le to the output \nconnectors , which minimizes  noise pickup and reflections due \nto impedance mismatch.  \nThe video output signals o verlay the ground plane  and not the \nanalog power plane, thereby maximizing the high frequency \npower supply rejection.  \nFor optimum perform ance, the analog outputs each have a \nsource termination resistance to ground of 75 Ω (doubly \nterminated 75 Ω configuration). This termination resistance \nmust  be as close as possible to the ADV7127 to minimize \nreflections.  \nAdditional information on PCB design is available in  the \nAN-333 Application Note , Design and Layout of a Video \nGraphics System for Reduced EMI . \n \nData Sheet ADV7127\n \nRev.
