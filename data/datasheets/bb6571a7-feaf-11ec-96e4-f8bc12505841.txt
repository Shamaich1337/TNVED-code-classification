These \ndevices perform the same electronic adjustment function as mechanical potentiometers\n1 or variable resistors but with \nenhanced resolution, solid-state reliability, and superior low temperature coefficient performance. The wiper settings are controllable through an SPI-compatible digital interface. The resistance between the wiper and either end point of the fixed resistor varies linearly with respect to the \ndigital code transferred into the RDAC latch. \nOperating from a 2.7 V to 5.5 V power supply and consuming \nless than 5 μA allows for usage in portable battery-operated \napplications. \n \n     \n \n    \n1 The terms digital potentiometer, VR, and RDAC are used interchangeably. \nAD5160  Data Sheet  \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \nFeatures  .............................................................................................. 1 \nApplications  ....................................................................................... 1 \nFunctional Block Diagram  .............................................................. 1 \nPin Configuration  ............................................................................. 1 \nGeneral Description  ......................................................................... 1 \nRevision History  ............................................................................... 2 \nSpecifications  ..................................................................................... 3 \nElectrical Characteristics —5 kΩ Version  .................................. 3 \n10 kΩ, 50 kΩ, 100 kΩ Versions  .................................................. 4 \nTiming Characteristics —All Versions  ....................................... 5 \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  ............................................................ 6 \nESD Caution  .................................................................................. 6 \nPin Configuration and Function Descriptions  ............................. 7 Typical Performance Characteristics  ..............................................8  \nTest Circuits  ..................................................................................... 12 \nSPI Interface  .................................................................................... 13 \nTheory of Operation  ...................................................................... 14 \nProgramming the Variable Resistor  ......................................... 14 \nProgramming the Po tentiometer Divider  ............................... 15 \nSPI-Compatible 3 -Wire Serial Bus  ........................................... 15 \nESD Protection  ........................................................................... 15 \nPower -Up Sequence  ................................................................... 15 \nLayout and Power Supply Bypassing  ....................................... 15 \nOutline Dimensions  ....................................................................... 16 \nOrdering Guide  .......................................................................... 16 \n \nREVISION HISTORY  \n11/14— Rev.

C | Page 14 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD5160 is a 256-position digitally controlled variable \nresistor (VR) device. \nAn internal power-on preset places the wiper at midscale \nduring power-on, which simplifies the fault condition recovery \nat power-up. \nPROGRAMMING THE VARIABLE RESISTOR \nRheostat Operation \nThe nominal resistance of the RDAC between Terminal A and \nTerminal B is available in 5 kΩ, 10 kΩ, 50 kΩ, and 100 kΩ. The \nfinal two or three digits of the model number as listed in the Ordering Guide section determine the nominal resistance value, \nfor example, in model AD5160BRJZ10, the 10 represents 10 kΩ; \nand in AD5160BRJZ50, the 50 represents 50 kΩ.  \nThe nominal resistance (R\nAB) of the VR has 256 contact points \naccessed by the wiper terminal, plus the B terminal contact. The \n8-bit data in the RDAC latch is decoded to select one of the 256 \npossible settings.  \nAssuming a 10 kΩ part is used, the first connection of the wiper \nstarts at the B terminal for Data 0x00. Because there is a 60 Ω wiper contact resistance, such connection yields a minimum of 60 Ω resistance between Terminal W and Terminal B.  \nThe second connection is the first tap point, which corresponds \nto 99 Ω (R\nWB = R AB/256 + R W = 39 Ω + 60 Ω) for Data 0x01.  \nThe third connection is the next tap point, representing 138 Ω  \n(2 × 39 Ω + 60 Ω) for Data 0x02, and so on. Each LSB data value increase moves the wiper up the resistor ladder until the last tap point is reached at 9961 Ω (R\nAB − 1 LSB + R W). Figure 39 \nshows a simplified diagram of the equivalent RDAC circuit where the last resistor string is not accessed; therefore, there is \n1 LSB less of the nominal resistance  at full scale in addition to \nthe wiper resistance.  \nBRDAC\nLATCH\nAND\nDECODERWA\nRS\nRS\nRS\nRSD7\nD6\nD4D5\nD2D3\nD1\nD0\n \nFigure 39.

Take care to limit the current flow between W and B in this state to a maximum pulse current of no more than \n20 mA. Otherwise, degradation or possible destruction of the \ninternal switch contact can occur. \nSimilar to the mechanical potentiometer, the resistance of the \nRDAC between the Wiper W and Terminal A also produces a digitally controlled complementary resistance (R\nWA). When \nthese terminals are used, the B terminal can be opened. Setting \nthe resistance value for R WA starts at a maximum value of \nresistance and decreases as the data loaded in the latch increases \nin value. The general equation for this operation is \nW AB WA R RDD R \uf02b \uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d256256) (  (2) \nFor R AB = 10 kΩ and the B terminal is open circuited, the \nfollowing output resistance R WA is set for the indicated RDAC \nlatch codes. \nTable 8.

Because the resistance element is \nprocessed in thin film technology, the change in R AB with \ntemperature has a very low 45 ppm/°C temperature coefficient. \nData Sheet AD5160\n \nRev. C | Page 15 of 16 PROGRAMMING THE POTENTIOMETER DIVIDER \nVoltage Output Operation \nThe digital potentiometer easily generates a voltage divider at \nwiper-to-B and wiper-to-A proportional to the input voltage at \nA-to-B. Unlike the polarity of V DD to GND, which must be \npositive, voltage across A to B, W to A, and W to B can be at \neither polarity.  \nIf ignoring the effect of the wiper resistance for approximation, \nconnecting the A terminal to 5 V and the B terminal to ground \nproduces an output voltage at the wiper-to-B starting at 0 V up \nto 1 LSB less than 5 V . Each LSB of voltage is equal to the voltage applied across Terminal A and Terminal B divided by the 256 positions of the potentiometer divider. The general equation defining the output voltage at V\nW with respect to \nground for any valid input voltage applied to Terminal A and \nTerminal B is \nB A W VDVDD V256256\n256) (\uf02d\uf02b \uf03d  (3) \nFor a more accurate calculation, which includes the effect of \nwiper resistance, V W can be found as \nBWA\nAWB\nW VD RVD RD V256) (\n256) () ( \uf02b \uf03d  (4) \nOperation of the digital potentiometer in the divider mode \nresults in a more accurate operation over temperature. Unlike the rheostat mode, the output voltage is dependent mainly on \nthe ratio of the internal resistors (R\nWA and R WB) and not the \nabsolute values. Therefore, the temperature drift reduces to \n15 ppm/°C. \nSPI-COMPATIBLE 3-WIRE SERIAL BUS \nThe AD5160 contains a 3-wire SPI-compatible digital interface \n(SDI, CS, and CLK). The 8-bit serial word must be loaded MSB \nfirst. The format of the word is shown in Table 6. \nThe positive-edge sensitive CLK input requires clean transitions \nto avoid clocking incorrect data into the serial input register. Standard logic families work well. If mechanical switches are used for product evaluation, they should be debounced by a \nflip-flop or other suitable means. When CS\n is low, the clock \nloads data into the serial register on each positive clock edge \n(see Figure 37). \nThe data setup and data hold times in the specification table \ndetermine the valid timing requirements. The AD5160 uses an \n8-bit serial input data register word that is transferred to the \ninternal RDAC register when the CS line returns to logic high. \nExtra MSB bits are ignored.  \n ESD PROTECTION \nAll digital inputs are protected with a series input resistor and \nparallel Zener ESD structures are shown in Figure 40 and \nFigure 41. This applies to SDI, CLK, and CS, which are the \ndigital input pins. \nLOGIC340Ω\nGND \nFigure 40. ESD Protection of Digital Pins \nA,B,W\nGND  \nFigure 41. ESD Protection of Resistor Terminals \nPOWER-UP SEQUENCE \nBecause the ESD protection diodes limit the voltage compliance \nat the A, B, and W terminals, it is important to power V DD/GND \nbefore applying any voltage to the A, B, and W terminals; \notherwise, the diode forward biases such that V DD is powered \nunintentionally and may affect the rest of the user’s circuit. The \nideal power-up sequence is in the following order: GND, V DD, \ndigital inputs, and then V A/B/W. The relative order of powering \nVA, V B, V W, and the digital inputs is not important as long as \nthey are powered after V DD/GND. \nLAYOUT AND POWER SUPPLY BYPASSING \nIt is a good practice to employ compact, minimum lead length layout design. Keep the leads to the inputs as direct as possible \nwith a minimum conductor length. Ground paths should have low resistance and low inductance. \nSimilarly, it is also a good practice to bypass the power supplies \nwith quality capacitors for optimum stability. Bypass supply \nleads to the device with disc or chip ceramic capacitors of 0.01 μF to 0.1 μF. To minimize any transient disturbance and low frequency ripple, apply low ESR 1 μF to 10 μF tantalum or electrolytic capacitors at the supplies (see Figure 42). To \nminimize the ground bounce, join the digital ground remotely \nto the analog ground at a single point. \n \nAD5160VDD\nC1 C3\nGND10\uf06dF 0.1 \uf06dF+VDD\n \nFigure 42.
