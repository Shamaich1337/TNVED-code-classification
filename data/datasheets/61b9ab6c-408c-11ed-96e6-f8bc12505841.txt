The COUT pin is with respect to V–, and the \nDOUT pin is with respect to VSS.\n1.Overcharge detection voltage and overcharge release voltage (Test Circuit 1):\nThe overcharge detection voltage (V OVP) is measured between the BAT and VSS pins, respectively. Once \nV1 is increased, the over-detection is triggered, and the delay timer expires. Then, COUT transitions from a \nhigh to low state and reduces the V1 voltage to check for the overcharge hysteresis parameter (V OVP-Hys ). \nThe delta voltage between overcharge detection voltages (V OVP) and the overcharge release occurs when \nthe CHG FET drive output goes from low to high.\n2.Over-discharge detection voltage and over-discharge release voltage (Test Circuit 2):\nOver-discharge detection (V UVP) is defined as the voltage between BAT and VSS at which the DSG drive \noutput goes from high to low by reducing the V1 voltage.

Test Circuit 5\n9 Detailed Description\n9.1 Overview\nThis BQ2970 device is a primary protector for a single-cell Li-ion/Li-polymer battery pack. The device uses a \nminimum number of external components to protect for overcurrent conditions due to high discharge/charge \ncurrents in the application. In addition, it monitors and helps to protect against battery pack overcharging or \ndepletion of energy in the pack. The BQ2970 device is capable of having an input voltage of 8 V from a charging \nadapter and can tolerate a voltage of BAT – 25 V across the two input pins. In the condition when a fault is \ntriggered, there are timer delays before the appropriate action is taken to turn OFF either the CHG or DSG \nFETs. The recovery period also has a timer delay once the threshold for recovery condition is satisfied. These \nparameters are fixed once they are programmed. There is also a feature called zero voltage charging that \nenables depleted cells to be charged to an acceptable level before the battery pack can be used for normal \noperation. Zero voltage charging is allowed if the charger voltage is above 1.7 V. For Factory Programmable \nOptions, see Table 9-1 .\nTable 9-1.

An internal oscillator initiates a timer to the fixed delays \nassociated with each parameter once the fault is triggered. Once the timer expires due to a fault condition, the \nappropriate FET drive output (COUT or DOUT) is activated to turn OFF the external FET. The same method is \napplicable for the recovery feature once the system fault is removed and the recovery parameter is satisfied, \nthen the recovery timer is initiated. If there are no reoccurrences of this fault during this period, the appropriate \ngate drive is activated to turn ON the appropriate external FET.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\n9.4.1 Normal Operation\nThis device monitors the voltage of the battery connected between BAT pin and VSS pin and the differential \nvoltage between V– pin and VSS pin to control charging and discharging. The system is operating in NORMAL \nmode when the battery voltage range is between the over-discharge detection threshold (V UVP) and the \novercharge detection threshold (V OVP), and the V– pin voltage is within the range for charge overcurrent \nthreshold (V OCC) to over-discharge current threshold (V OCD) when measured with respect to VSS. If these \nconditions are satisfied, the device turns ON the drive for COUT and DOUT FET control.www.ti.comBQ2970, BQ2971, BQ2972, BQ2973\nSLUSBU9H – MARCH 2014 – REVISED JUNE 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: BQ2970  BQ2971  BQ2972  BQ2973\nCAUTION\nWhen the battery is connected for the first time, the discharging circuit might not be enabled. In this \ncase, short the V– pin to the VSS pin.\nAlternatively, connect the charger between the Pack+ and Pack– terminals in the system.\n9.4.2 Overcharge Status\nThis mode is detected when the battery voltage measured is higher than the overcharge detection threshold \n(VOVP) during charging. If this condition exists for a period greater than the overcharge detection delay (t OVPD ) or \nlonger, the COUT output signal is driven low to turn OFF the charging FET to prevent any further charging of the \nbattery.\nThe overcharge condition is released if one of the following conditions occurs:\n•If the V– pin is higher than the overcharge detection voltage (V OCC_Min ), the device releases the overcharge \nstatus when the battery voltage drops below the overcharge release voltage (V OVP-Hys ).\n•If the V– pin is higher than or equal to the over-discharge detection voltage (V OCD), the device releases the \novercharge status when the battery voltage drops below the overcharge detection voltage (V OVP).\nThe discharge is initiated by connecting a load after the overcharge detection. The V– pin rises to a voltage \ngreater than VSS due to the parasitic diode of the charge FET conducting to support the load. If the V– pin \nvoltage is higher than or equal to the discharge overcurrent detection threshold (V OCD), the overcurrent condition \nstatus is released only if the battery voltage drops lower than or equal to the overcharge detection voltage \n(VOVP).\nCAUTION\n1.If the battery is overcharged to a level greater than overcharge detection (V OVP) and the \nbattery voltage does not drop below the overcharge detection voltage (V OVP) with a heavy load \nconnected, the discharge overcurrent and load short-circuit detection features do not function \nuntil the battery voltage drops below the overcharge detection voltage (V OVP). The internal \nimpedance of a battery is in the order of tens of mΩ, so application of a heavy load on the output \nshould allow the battery voltage to drop immediately, enabling discharge overcurrent detection \nand load short-circuit detection features after an overcharge release delay.\n2.When a charger is connected after an overcharge detection, the overcharge status does \nnot release even if the battery voltage drops below the overcharge release threshold. The \novercharge status is released when the V– pin voltage exceeds the overcurrent detection \nvoltage (V OCD) by removing the charger.\n9.4.3 Over-Discharge Status\nIf the battery voltage drops below the over-discharge detection voltage (V UVP) for a time greater than (t UVPD) \nthe discharge control output, DOUT is switched to a low state and the discharge FET is turned OFF to prevent \nfurther discharging of the battery. This is referred to as an over-discharge detection status. In this condition, the \nV– pin is internally pulled up to BAT by the resistor R V–D. When this occurs, the voltage difference between \nV– and BAT pins is 1.3 V or lower, and the current consumption of the device is reduced to power-down level \nISTANDBY . The current sink I V–S is not active in power-down state or over-discharge state. The power-down state \nis released when a charger is connected and the voltage delta between V– and BAT pins is greater than 1.3 V.\nIf a charger is connected to a battery in over-discharge state and the voltage detected at the V– is lower than \n–0.7 V, the device releases the over-discharge state and allows the DOUT pin to go high and turn ON the \ndischarge FET once the battery voltage exceeds over-discharge detection voltage (V UVP).\nIf a charger is connected to a battery in over-discharge state and the voltage detected at the V– is higher \nthan –0.7 V, the device releases the over-discharge state and allows the DOUT pin to go high and turn \nON the discharge FET once the battery voltage exceeds over-discharge detection release hysteresis voltage \n(VUVP +Hys ).BQ2970, BQ2971, BQ2972, BQ2973\nSLUSBU9H – MARCH 2014 – REVISED JUNE 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ2970  BQ2971  BQ2972  BQ2973\n9.4.4 Discharge Overcurrent Status (Discharge Overcurrent, Load Short-Circuit)\nWhen a battery is in normal operation and the V– pin is equal to or higher than the discharge overcurrent \nthreshold for a time greater than the discharge overcurrent detection delay, the DOUT pin is pulled low to turn \nOFF the discharge FET and prevent further discharge of the battery. This is known as the discharge overcurrent \nstatus. In the discharge overcurrent status, the V– and VSS pins are connected by a constant current sink I V–S. \nWhen this occurs and a load is connected, the V– pin is at BAT potential. If the load is disconnected, the V– pin \ngoes to VSS (BAT/2) potential.\nThis device detects the status when the impedance between Pack+ and Pack– (see Figure 26 ) increases and \nis equal to the impedance that enables the voltage at the V– pin to return to BAT – 1 V or lower. The discharge \novercurrent status is restored to the normal status.\nAlternatively, by connecting the charger to the system, the device returns to normal status from discharge \novercurrent detection status, because the voltage at the V– pin drops to BAT – 1 V or lower.\nThe resistance R V–D between V– and BAT is not connected in the discharge overcurrent detection status.\n9.4.5 Charge Overcurrent Status\nWhen a battery is in normal operation status and the voltage at V– pin is lower than the charge overcurrent \ndetection due to high charge current for a time greater than charge overcurrent detection delay, the COUT pin \nis pulled low to turn OFF the charge FET and prevent further charging to continue. This is known as charge \novercurrent status.\nThe device is restored to normal status from charge overcurrent status when the voltage at the V– pin returns to \ncharge overcurrent detection voltage or higher by removing the charger from the system.\nThe charge overcurrent detection feature does not work in the over-discharge status.\nThe resistance R V–D between V– and BAT and the current sink I V–S is not connected in the charge overcurrent \nstatus.\n9.4.6 0-V Charging Function Enabled\nThis feature enables recharging a connected battery that has very low voltage due to self-discharge. When the \ncharger applies a voltage greater than or equal to V 0CHG to Pack+ and Pack– connections, the COUT pin gate \ndrive is fixed by the BAT pin voltage.\nOnce the voltage between the gate and the source of the charging FET becomes equal to or greater than the \nturn ON voltage due to the charger voltage, the charging FET is ON and the battery is charged with current flow \nthrough the charging FET and the internal parasitic diode of the discharging FET. Once the battery voltage is \nequal to or higher than the over-discharge release voltage, the device enters normal status.\nCAUTION\n1.Some battery providers do not recommend charging a depleted (self-discharged) battery. \nConsult the battery supplier to determine whether to have the 0-V battery charger function.\n2.The 0-V battery charge feature has a higher priority than the charge overcurrent detection \nfunction. In this case, the 0-V charging will be allowed and the battery charges forcibly, which \nresults in charge overcurrent detection being disabled if the battery voltage is lower than the \nover-discharge detection voltage.\n9.4.7 0-V Charging Inhibit Function\nThis feature inhibits recharging a battery that has an internal short circuit of a 0-V battery. If the battery voltage \nis below the charge inhibit voltage V 0INH or lower, the charge FET control gate is fixed to the Pack– voltage to \ninhibit charging. When the battery is equal to V 0INH or higher, charging can be performed. The 0-V charge inhibit \nfunction is available in all configurations of the BQ297xx device.www.ti.comBQ2970, BQ2971, BQ2972, BQ2973\nSLUSBU9H – MARCH 2014 – REVISED JUNE 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: BQ2970  BQ2971  BQ2972  BQ2973\nCAUTION\nSome battery providers do not recommend charging a depleted (self-discharged) battery.

However, during any time the \ndischarge overcurrent detection exceeds the short circuit detection threshold for a time greater than or equal to \nload circuit detection delay t SCCD , the DOUT pin goes low in a faster delay for protection.BQ2970, BQ2971, BQ2972, BQ2973\nSLUSBU9H – MARCH 2014 – REVISED JUNE 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ2970  BQ2971  BQ2972  BQ2973\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

Selecting a device with a 70-mV trigger threshold \nfor Charge Overcurrent trigger is acceptable.\n•The total Rds ON should factor in any worst-case parameter based on the FET ON resistance, de-rating due \nto temperature effects and minimum required operation, and the associated gate drive (Vgs). Therefore, the \nFET choice should meet the following criteria:\n    Vdss = 25 V\n    Each FET Rds ON = 7.5 mΩ at Tj = 25°C and Vgs = 3.5 V\n•Imax > 50 A to allow for short Circuit Current condition for 350 µs (max delay timer). The only limiting factor \nduring this condition is Pack Voltage/(Cell Resistance + (2 × FET_RdsON) + Trace Resistance).\n•Use the CSD16406Q3 FET for the application.\n•An RC filter is required on the BAT for noise, and enables the device to operate during sharp negative \ntransients. The 330-Ω resistor also limits the current during a reverse connection on the system.\n•TI recommends placing a high impedance 5-MΩ across the gate source of each external FET to deplete any \ncharge on the gate-source capacitance.BQ2970, BQ2971, BQ2972, BQ2973\nSLUSBU9H – MARCH 2014 – REVISED JUNE 2021 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ2970  BQ2971  BQ2972  BQ2973\n10.2.3 Application Performance Plots\nOrange Line (Channel 1) = Power Up Ramp on BAT Pin\nTurquoise Line (Channel 2) = DOUT Gate Drive Output\nDOUT goes from low to high when UVP Recovery = UVP Set \nThreshold +100 mV\nFigure 10-2.
