This improvement in heat flow rate results in lowerdie temperature hence improves reliability.GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADP3367 is a low-dropout precision voltage regulator thatcan supply up to 300 mA output current. It can be used to givea fixed +5 V output with no additional external components or\ncan be adjusted from +1.3 V to +16 V using two external\nresistors. Fixed or adjustable operation can be selected via theSET input. The low quiescent current (17 µA) in conjunction\nwith the standby or shutdown mode (0.2 µA) makes this device\nespecially suitable for battery powered systems. The dropoutvoltage when supplying 100 µA is only 15 mV allowing opera-\ntion with minimal headroom thereby prolonging the useful bat-tery life. At higher output current levels the dropout remainslow increasing to just 150 mV when supplying 200 mA. A wide\ninput voltage range from 2.5 V to 16.5 V is allowable. Addi-\ntional features include a dropout detector and a low supply/bat-tery monitoring comparator. The dropout detector can be used\nto signal loss of regulation while the low battery detector can be\nused to monitor the input supply voltage.\nThe ADP3367 is a much improved pin-compatible replacement\nfor the MAX667. Improvements include lower supply current,\ntighter voltage accuracy and superior line and load regulation.\nImproved ESD protection (>6000 V) is achieved by advancedvoltage clamping structures. The ADP3367 is specified over the\nindustrial temperature range –40 °C to +85 °C and is available in\nnarrow surface mount (SOIC) packages.\n\nADP3367–SPECIFICATIONS\nParameter Min Typ Max Units Test Conditions/Comments\nInput Voltage, V IN 2.5 16.5 V\nOutput Voltage, V OUT 4.9 5.0 5.1 V V SET = 0 V, V IN = 6 V, I OUT = 10 mA\nMaximum Output Current 200 mA V IN = +9 V, + 4.5 V < V OUT < +5.5 V\nQuiescent Current\nIGND: Shutdown Mode 0.2 0.75 µAV SHDN = 2 V\nIGND: Normal Mode VSHDN = 0 V, V SET = 0 V\n17 25 µAI OUT = 0 µA\n20 30 µAI OUT = 100 µA\n51 4 m A I OUT = 200 mA\nDropout Voltage\nVOUT = 5 V 15 40 mV I OUT = 100 µA\n60 125 mV I OUT = 50 mA\n100 175 mV I OUT = 100 mA\n150 250 mV I OUT = 200 mA, T A = +25°C\n175 300 mV I OUT = 200 mA\n300 500 mV I OUT = 300 mA\nVOUT = 3.3 V 94 140 mV I OUT = 50 mA\n210 312 mV I OUT = 100 mA\n430 625 mV I OUT = 200 mA, T A = +25°C\nLoad Regulation 5 10 mV I OUT = 10 mA–100 mA, V IN = 6 V\nIOUT = 10 mA–200 mA, V IN = 6 V\nLine Regulation 0.1 5 mV V IN = 6 V to 10 V, I OUT = 10 mA\nReference Voltage, V SET 1.23 1.255 1.28 V\nSET Input Threshold 50 mV\nSET Input Current, I SET ±0.01±10 nA V SET = 1.5 V\nOutput Leakage Current, I OUT 0.1 1 µAV SHDN = 2 V\nShort Circuit Current, I OUT 400 mA T A = +25°C\n450 mA T A = T MIN to T MAX\nLow Battery Detector Input Threshold, V LBI 1.215 1.255 1.295 V\nLBI Hysteresis 6 mV\nLBI Input Leakage Current, I LBI ±0.01±10 nA V LBI = 1.5 V\nLow Battery Detector Output Voltage, V LBO 0.25 V V LBI = 0 V, I LBO = 10 mA, T A = +25°C\n0.40 V V LBI = 0 V, I LBO = 10 mA, T A = T MIN to T MAX\nShutdown Input Voltage, V SHDN 1.5 V V IH\n0.4 V V IL\nShutdown Input Current, I SHDN ±0.01±10 nA V SHDN = 0 V to V IN\nDropout Detector Output Voltage 0.25 V (V SET = 0 V, V SHDN = 0 V, R DD = 100 kΩ,\nVIN = 7 V, I OUT = 10 mA)\n4.0 (V SET = 0 V, V SHDN = 0 V, R DD = 100 kΩ,\nVIN = 4.5 V, I OUT = 10 mA)\nSpecifications subject to change without notice.(VIN = +9 V, GND = 0 V, V OUT = +5 V, T A = T MIN to T MAX unless otherwise noted)\n–2– REV. 0ORDERING GUIDE\nModel Temperature Range Package Option*\nADP3367AR –40 °C to +85 °C SO-8\n*SO = Small Outline Package.ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS*\n(TA= +25°C unless otherwise noted)\nInput Voltage, V IN . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  +18 V\nOutput Short Circuit to GND Duration  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  1 sec\nLBO Output Sink Current  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  50 mA\nLBO Output Voltage  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Thefeedback signal from the regulator output is supplied to the\nother input by an on-chip voltage divider or by two external\nresistors. When the SET input is at ground, the internal dividerprovides the error amplifier’s feedback signal giving a +5 V out-\nput. When SET is at more than 50 mV above ground, compara-\ntor C1 switches the error amplifier’s input directly to the SETpin, and external resistors are used to set the output voltage.\nThe external resistors are selected so that the desired output\nvoltage gives 1.255 V at the SET input.\nThe output from the error amplifier supplies base current to the\nPNP output pass transistor which provides output current. Up\nto 300 mA output current is available provided that the device\npower dissipation is not exceeded.\nComparator C2 compares the voltage on the Low Battery Input\n(LBI) pin to the internal +1.255 V reference voltage. The out-\nput from the comparator drives an open drain FET connected\nto the Low Battery Output pin, LBO. The Low Battery Thresh-old may be set using a suitable voltage divider connected to\nLBI. When the voltage on LBI falls below 1.255 V, the open\ndrain output, LBO, is pulled low.\nA shutdown (SHDN) input that can be used to disable the\nerror amplifier and hence the voltage output is also available.\nThe supply current in shutdown is less than 0.75 µA.\nADP3367IN\nSHDN\nLBO\nLBI\nGND50mVSETDDOUT\n1.255V\nREFA1\nC1\nC2\nFigure 1.

This basic configuration is\nshown in Figure 8. The input voltage can range from +5.15 Vto +16.5 V, and output currents up to 300 mA are available\nprovided that the maximum package power dissipation is not\nexceeded.\nIN OUT\nGND SET SHDNADP3367+5V\nOUTPUT\nC110µF++\nFigure 8. Fixed +5 V Output Circuit\nOutput Voltage Setting\nIf the SET input is connected to a resistor divider network, the\noutput voltage is set according to the following equation:\n    VOUT=VSET×R1+R2\nR1\nwhere VSET = 1.255 V.\nIN\nOUT\nGNDSET\nSHDNADP3367+\nR1R2VIN\nVOUT\nC1\n10µF\nFigure 9. Adjustable Output Circuit\nThe resistor values may be selected by first choosing a value for\nR1 and then selecting R2 according to the following equation:\n    R2=R1×VOUT\nVSET−1\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nThe input leakage current on SET is 10 nA maximum. This\nallows large resistor values to be chosen for R1 and R2 with\nlittle degradation in accuracy. For example, a 1 M Ω resistor\nmay be selected for R1, and then R2 may be calculated accord-\ningly. The tolerance on SET is guaranteed at less than ±25 mV,\nso in most applications fixed resistors will be suitable.\nShutdown Input (SHDN)\nThe SHDN input allows the regulator to be switched off with alogic level signal. This will disable the output and reduce the\ncurrent drain to a low quiescent (0.75 µA maximum) current.\nThis is very useful for low power applications. Driving the\nSHDN input to greater than 1.5 V places the part in shutdown.\nIf the shutdown function is not being used, then SHDN should\nbe connected to GND.Low Supply or Low Battery Detection\nThe ADP3367 contains on-chip circuitry for low power supply\nor battery detection. If the voltage on the LBI pin falls below\nthe internal 1.255 V reference, then the open drain output LBO\nwill go low. The low threshold voltage may be set to any voltageabove 1.255 V by appropriate resistor divider selection.\n    R3=R4×VBATT\nVLBI−1\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nwhere R3 and R4 are the resistive divider resistors and V BATT is\nthe desired low voltage threshold.\nSince the LBI input leakage current is less than 10 nA, large\nvalues may be selected for R3 and R4 in order to minimize\nloading. For example, a 6 V low threshold, may be set using10 MΩ for R3 and 2.7 M Ω for R4.\nThe LBO output is an open-drain output that goes low sinking\ncurrent when LBI is less than 1.255 V. A pull-up resistor of\n10 kΩ or greater may be used to obtain a logic output level with\nthe pull-up resistor connected to V\nOUT.\nIN\nOUT\nLBOADP3367C1\n10µF+\n10kΩVIN\nLBI\nGNDSET SHDNR3\nR4LOW BATTERYSTATUS OUTPUTV\nOUT\nFigure 10. Low Battery/Supply Detect Circuit\nDropout Detector\nThe ADP3367 features an extremely low dropout voltage mak-ing it suitable for low voltage systems where headroom islimited. A dropout detector is also provided. The dropout\ndetector output, DD, changes as the dropout voltage approaches\nits limit. This is useful for warning that regulation can no longer bemaintained. The dropout detector output is an open collector out-\nput from a PNP transistor. Under normal operating conditions\nwith the input voltage more than 300 mV above the output, thePNP transistor is off and no current flows out the DD pin. As the\nvoltage differential reduces to less than 300 mV, the transistor\nswitches on and current is sourced. This condition indicates thatregulation can no longer be maintained. Please refer to Figure 4 in\nthe “Typical Performance Characteristics.” The current output\ncan be translated into a voltage output by connecting a resistorfrom DD to GND. A resistor value of 100 k Ω is suitable. A digital\nstatus signal can be obtained using a comparator. The on-chipcomparator LBI may be used if it is not being used to monitor abattery voltage. This is illustrated in Figure 11.\nADP3367\n–6– REV. 0+C1\n10µFINOUT\nLBOADP3367+5VOUTPUT\nR210kΩ\nLBI\nGNDSET SHDNDROPOUTSTATUSOUTPUTDDVIN\nR1100kΩ+\nFigure 11. Dropout Status Output\nOutput Capacitor\nAn output capacitor is required on the ADP3367 to maintain sta-\nbility and also to improve the load transient response. Capacitor\nvalues from 10 µF upwards are recommended. Capacitors larger\nthan 10µF will further improve the transient response. Tantalum\nor aluminum electrolytics are suitable for most applications. Fortemperatures below about –25 °C, solid tantalums should be used\nas many aluminum electrolytes freeze at this temperature.\nQuiescent Current Considerations\nThe ADP3367 uses a PNP output stage to achieve low dropoutvoltages combined with high output current capability. Under\nnormal regulating conditions the quiescent current is extremelylow. However if the input voltage drops so that it is below the\ndesired output voltage, the quiescent current increases consider-\nably. This happens because regulation can no longer be main-tained and large base current flows in the PNP output transistor\nin an attempt to hold it fully on.  For minimum quiescent cur-\nrent, it is therefore important that the input voltage is main-tained higher than the desired output level. If the device is being\npowered using a battery that can discharge down below the rec-\nommended level, there are a couple of techniques that can beapplied to reduce the quiescent current, but at the expense of\ndropout voltage. The first of these is illustrated in Figure 12. By\nconnecting DD to SHDN the regulator is partially disabled withinput voltages below the desired output voltage and therefore\nthe quiescent current is reduced considerably.\n+C1\n10µFIN OUT\nADP3367+5VOUTPUT\nGNDSET SHDNDDVIN\nR1\n47kΩ+\nC20.1µF\nFigure 12. IQ Reduction 1\nAnother technique for reducing the quiescent current near drop-\nout is illustrated in Figure 13. The DD output is used to modify\nthe output voltage so that as V IN drops, the desired output volt-\nage setpoint also drops. This technique only works when exter-\nnal resistors are used to set the output voltage. With V INgreater\nthan V OUT, DD has no effect. As V INreduces and dropout isreached, the DD output starts sourcing current into the SET\ninput through R3. This increases the SET voltage so that theregulator feedback loop does not drive the internal PNP transis-\ntor as hard as it otherwise would. As the input voltage continues\nto decrease, more current is sourced, thereby reducing the PNPdrive even further. The advantage of this scheme is that it main-\ntains a low quiescent current down to very low values of V\nINat\nwhich point the batteries are well outside their useful operating\nrange. The output voltage tracks the input voltage minus the\ndropout. The SHDN function is also unaffected and may be\nused normally if desired.\n+C1\n10µFIN OUT\nADP3367+5VOUTPUT\nGNDSET SHDN\nDDR1610kΩR22MΩ\nR3\n1MΩ+\nVIN\nQUIESCENT CURRENT BELOW DROPOUT0\n16 23 5400\n2009001mA\n800\n700600\n500µA\n300\n100\n41.2mA\n900µA\nVIN – VGROUND PIN CURRENT\nFigure 13. IQ Reduction 2\nPOWER DISSIPATION\nThe ADP3367 can supply currents up to 300 mA and can oper-\nate with input voltages as high as 16.5 V, but not simultaneously.\nIt is important that the power dissipation and hence the internaldie temperature be maintained below the maximum limits. Power\nDissipation is the product of the voltage differential across the\nregulator times the current being supplied to the load. Themaximum package power dissipation is given in the Absolute\nMaximum Ratings. In order to avoid excessive die temperatures,\nthese ratings must be strictly observed.\nP\nD = (V IN– V OUT) (I L)\nThe die temperature is dependent on both the ambient tempera-ture and on the power being dissipated by the device. The inter-\nnal die temperature must not exceed 125 °C. Therefore, care\nmust be taken to ensure that, under normal operating condi-\ntions, the die temperature is kept below the thermal limit.\nT\nJ= TA + PD (θJA)\nADP3367\nREV. 0 –7–This may be expressed in terms of power dissipation as follows:\nPD = (TJ– TA)/(θJA)\nwhere:\nTJ= Die Junction Temperature  (°C)\nTA= Ambient Temperature ( °C)\nPD= Power Dissipation (W)\nθJA= Junction to Ambient Thermal Resistance  (°C/W)\nIf the device is being operated at the maximum permitted ambi-\nent temperature of 85 °C, the maximum power dissipation per-\nmitted is:\nPD (max)  = (T J (max) – TA)/(θJA)\nPD (max) = (125 – 85)/( θJA)\n= 40/θJA\nwhere:\nθJA = 98°C/W for the 8-pin SOIC (R-8) package\nTherefore, for a maximum ambient temperature of 85 °C\nPD (max) = 408 mW for R- 8\nAt lower ambient temperatures the maximum permitted powerdissipation increases accordingly up to the maximum limitsspecified in the absolute maximum specifications.\nThe thermal impedance (θ\nJA) figures given are measured in still\nair conditions and are reduced considerably where fan assisted\ncooling is employed. Other techniques for reducing the thermalimpedance include large contact pads on the printed circuit\nboard and wide traces. The copper will act as a heat exchanger\nthereby reducing the effective thermal impedance.\nPOWER DISSIPATION\nLow Thermal Resistance Package\nThe ADP3367 utilizes a patented and proprietary Thermal\nCoastline Leadframe which offers significantly lower resistance\nto heat flow from die to the PC board.\nHeat generated on the die is removed and transferred to the PC\nboard faster resulting in lower die temperature than standard\npackages. Table II is a performance comparison between and\nstandard and Thermal Coastline package.\nTable I. Thermal Resistance Performance Comparison*\nStandard Package (SO-8) Thermal Coastline Package\nθJC 44°C/W 40° C/W\nθJA 170°C/W 98 °C/W\nPD 235 mW 408 mW\n*Data presented in Table II is obtained using SEMI Standard Method G38-47\nand SEMI Standard Specification G42-88.\nA device operating at room temperature, +25 °C, and +125 °C\njunction temperature can dissipate 1.15 W.\nTo maintain this high level of heat removal efficiency, once heat\nis removed from the die to the PC board, it should be dissipated\nto the air or other mediums to maintain the largest possible tem-perature differential between the die and PC board; remember,\nthe rate at which heat is transferred is directly proportional tothe temperature differential.\nVarious PC board layout techniques could be used to remove\nthe heat from the immediate vicinity of the package. Consider\nthe following issues when designing a board layout:\n1. PC board traces with larger copper cross section areas will\nremove more heat; use PCs with thicker copper and/or wider\ntraces.\n2. Increase the surface area exposed to open air so heat can be\nremoved by convection or forced air flow.\n3. Use larger masses such as heat sinks or thermally conductive\nenclosures to distribute and dissipate the heat.\n4. Do not solder mask or silk screen the heat dissipating traces;\nblack anodizing will significantly improve heat dissipation by\nmeans of increased radiation.\nHigh Power Dissipation Recommendations\nWhere excessive power dissipation due to high input-output\ndifferential voltages and/or high current conditions exists, the\nsimplest method of reducing the power requirements on theregulator is to use a series dropper resistor.  In this way the\nexcess power can be dissipated in the external resistor. As an\nexample, consider an input voltage of +12 V and an outputvoltage requirement of +5 V @ 100 mA with an ambient tem-\nperature of +85 °C. The package power dissipation under these\nconditions is 700 mW which exceeds the maximum ratings. By\nusing a dropper resistor to drop 4 V, the power dissipation\nrequirement for the regulator is reduced to 300 mW which is\nwithin the maximum specifications for the SO-8 package at85°C. The resistor value is calculated as R = 4/0.1 = 40 Ω.A\nresistor power rating of 1/2 W or greater may be used.\nIN OUT\nGND SET SHDNADP3367+5V\nOUTPUT\nC210µF+40Ω\n0.5W\nC1\n1µFVIN\n12V+\nFigure 14.
