The REF20xx provides a \nreference voltage (V REF) for the ADC and a second \nhighly-accurate voltage (V BIAS) that can be used to \nbias the input bipolar signals.\nThe REF20xx offers excellent temperature drift\n(8 ppm/°C, maximum) and initial accuracy (0.05%) \non both the V REF and V BIAS outputs while operating \nat a quiescent current less than 430 µA. In addition, \nthe V REF and V BIAS outputs track each other with \na precision of 6 ppm/°C (maximum) across the \ntemperature range of –40°C to 125°C. All these \nfeatures increase the precision of the signal chain and \ndecrease board space, while reducing the cost of the \nsystem as compared to a discrete solution. Extremely \nlow dropout voltage of only 10 mV allows operation \nfrom very low input voltages, which can be very useful \nin battery-operated systems.\nBoth the V REF and V BIAS voltages have the same \nexcellent specifications and can sink and source \ncurrent equally well. Very good long-term stability and \nlow noise levels make these devices ideally-suited for \nhigh-precision industrial applications.\nDevice Information\nPART NAME PACKAGE (1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nREF20xx SOT-23 (5) 2.90 mm × 1.60 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the datasheet.\nINA213\nVINREF2030VREF\n3.0 VVBIAS\n1.5 V\nENADC\nGND\nLOAD\nISENSE RSHUNT\nVIN-VIN+\nREFVOUTPower\nSupply\nApplication Example\n-0.05 -0.04 -0.03 -0.02 -0.01 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 \n±75 ±50 ±25 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 Output Voltage Accuracy (%) \nTemperature ( \x83C) C001 VREF VBIAS VREF and V BIAS vs TemperatureREF2025 , REF2030 , REF2033 , REF2041\nSBOS600E  – JULY 2018 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Mechanical and thermal stress on the device die can cause \nthe output voltages to shift, degrading the initial accuracy specifications of the product. Reflow soldering is a \ncommon cause of this error.\nIn order to illustrate this effect, a total of 92 devices were soldered on four printed circuit boards [23 devices \non each printed circuit board (PCB)] using lead-free solder paste and the paste manufacturer suggested reflow \nprofile. The reflow profile is as shown in Figure 8-1 . The printed circuit board is comprised of FR4 material. The \nboard thickness is 1.57 mm and the area is 171.54 mm × 165.1 mm.\nThe reference and bias output voltages are measured before and after the reflow process; the typical shift is \ndisplayed in Figure 8-2  and Figure 8-3 . Although all tested units exhibit very low shifts (< 0.01%), higher shifts \nare also possible depending on the size, thickness, and material of the printed circuit board. An important note is \nthat the histograms display the typical shift for exposure to a single reflow profile. Exposure to multiple reflows, \nas is common on PCBs with surface-mount components on both sides, causes additional shifts in the output bias \nvoltage. If the PCB is exposed to multiple reflows, the device should be soldered in the second pass to minimize \nits exposure to thermal stress.\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 \n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Temperature ( \x83C) \nTime (seconds) C01\nFigure 8-1.

The Section \n9.2 section provides a block diagram of the basic band-gap topology and the two buffers used to derive the V REF \nand V BIAS outputs. Transistors Q 1 and Q 2 are biased such that the current density of Q 1 is greater than that of \nQ2. The difference of the two base emitter voltages (V BE1 – V BE2) has a positive temperature coefficient and is \nforced across resistor R 5. The voltage is amplified and added to the base emitter voltage of Q 2, which has a \nnegative temperature coefficient. The resulting band-gap output voltage is almost independent of temperature. \nTwo independent buffers are used to generate V REF and V BIAS from the band-gap voltage. The resistors R 1, R2 \nand R 3, R4 are sized such that V BIAS = V REF / 2.\ne-Trim™ is a method of package-level trim for the initial accuracy and temperature coefficient of V REF and V BIAS, \nimplemented during the final steps of manufacturing after the plastic molding process. This method minimizes \nthe influence of inherent transistor mismatch, as well as errors induced during package molding. e-Trim is \nimplemented in the REF20xx to minimize the temperature drift and maximize the initial accuracy of both the V REF \nand V BIAS outputs.\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\n+\n+e-Trim\ne-Trim+VREF\nVBIASR3R4R1R2\nQ1Q2VBE1 VBE2\n- -+ +R5R7 R6\n9.3 Feature Description\n9.3.1 VREF and V BIAS Tracking\nMost single-supply systems require an additional stable voltage in the middle of the analog-to-digital converter \n(ADC) input range to bias input bipolar signals. The V REF and V BIAS outputs of the REF20xx are generated from \nthe same band-gap voltage as shown in the Section 9.2 section. Hence, both outputs track each other over \nthe full temperature range of –40°C to 125°C with an accuracy of 7 ppm/°C (maximum). The tracking accuracy \nincreases to 6 ppm/°C (maximum) when the temperature range is limited to –40°C to 85°C. The tracking error is \ncalculated using the box method, as described by Equation 2 :\nDIFF(MAX) DIFF (MIN) 6\nREFV V Tracking Error  10    (ppm)V Temperature Range\x10 § ·  x ¨ ¸ x© ¹ \n(2)\nwhere\n•\n\x87DIFF REF BIASV V 2 V \x10 www.ti.comREF2025, REF2030, REF2033, REF2041\nSBOS600E – JULY 2018 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: REF2025  REF2030  REF2033  REF2041\nThe tracking accuracy is as shown in Figure 9-1 .\n-0.05 -0.04 -0.03 -0.02 -0.01 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 \n±75 ±50 ±25 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 Output Voltage Accuracy (%) \nTemperature ( \x83C) C001 VREF VBIAS \nFigure 9-1.

Both the V REF and V BIAS outputs \nof the device are protected from short circuits by limiting the output short-circuit current to 50 mA. The device \ntemperature increases according to Equation 4 :\n\x87J A D \x19-$ T T P R \x0e \n(4)\nwhere\n•TJ = junction temperature (°C),\n•TA = ambient temperature (°C),\n•PD = power dissipated (W), and\n•RθJA = junction-to-ambient thermal resistance (°C/W)\nThe REF20xx maximum junction temperature must not exceed the absolute maximum rating of 150°C.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\nWhen the EN pin of the REF20xx is pulled high, the device is in active mode. The device should be in active \nmode for normal operation. The REF20xx can be placed in a low-power mode by pulling the ENABLE pin low. \nWhen in shutdown mode, the output of the device becomes high impedance and the quiescent current of the \ndevice reduces to 5 µA in shutdown mode.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n10.1 Application Information\nThe low-drift, bidirectional, single-supply, low-side, current-sensing solution, described in this section, can \naccurately detect load currents from –2.5 A to 2.5 A. The linear range of the output is from 250 mV to 2.75 V. \nPositive current is represented by output voltages from 1.5 V to 2.75 V, whereas negative current is represented \nby output voltages from 250 mV to 1.5 V. The difference amplifier is the INA213  current-shunt monitor, whose \nsupply and reference voltages are supplied by the low-drift REF2030.\nIndustrial applications with electronics in corrosive environments are susceptible to corrosive damage due to the \nexposure to heat, moisture, and corrosive gases. The combination of the following conditions in a given system \nlead to higher risk of corrosive damage:\n1.Ventilated enclosures exposing underlying PCB.\n2.PCBs not conformally coated.\n3.Exposed-lead components with plating susceptible to corrosion.\n4.Changes in plating techniques for RoHS compliance (e.g. removal of Pb (lead) and certain types of plating).\nTo improve resistance to corrosion in harsh environments, the REF2025AISDDCR uses Matte-Sn plating with \nimproved assembly process to reduce exposed Cu, leading to improved corrosion resistance in the Battelle \nClass III and similar harsh environments. The “S” in the part number identifies this special plating option. \nREF2025 versions that do not have the “S” will continue to be available in industry standard NiPdAu processing \ntechnique.www.ti.comREF2025, REF2030, REF2033, REF2041\nSBOS600E – JULY 2018 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: REF2025  REF2030  REF2033  REF2041\n10.2 Typical Application\n10.2.1 Low-Side, Current-Sensing Application\nRSHUNT±ILOAD\nVBUS+IN+\nIN-REF\nOUT+Bandgap\nV+VCCVREF\nVBIASVIN\nEN\nGND\nGNDVOUTREF20xx\nINA213B+\n±\n+\n±\n+\nADCVREF\nFigure 10-1.

Therefore, the current-\nsensing solution is independent of the bus voltage, V BUS. When sensing bidirectional currents, use a differential \namplifier with a reference pin. This procedure allows for the differentiation between positive and negative \ncurrents by biasing the output stage such that it can respond to negative input voltages. There are a variety of \nmethods for supplying power (V+) and the reference voltage (V REF, or V BIAS) to the differential amplifier. For a \nlow-drift solution, use a monolithic reference that supplies both power and the reference voltage. Figure 10-2 \nshows the general circuit topology for a low-drift, low-side, bidirectional, current-sensing solution. This topology \nis particularly useful when interfacing with an ADC; see Figure 10-1 . Not only do V REF and V BIAS track over \ntemperature, but their matching is much better than alternate topologies.

If the value of \nVSHUNT  is too large, issues may arise when interfacing with systems whose ground potential is actually 0 V. Also, \na value of V SHUNT  that is too negative may violate the input common-mode voltage of the differential amplifier \nin addition to potential interfacing issues. Therefore, limiting the voltage across the shunt resistor is important. \nEquation 6  can be used to calculate the maximum value of R SHUNT .\n(max) LOAD(max) SHUNT\n(max) SHUNTIV\nR  \n(6)\nGiven that the maximum shunt voltage is ±25 mV and the load current range is ±2.5 A, the maximum shunt \nresistance is calculated as shown in Equation 7 .\n:   m10A 5 . 2mV25\nIV\nR\n(max) LOAD(max) SHUNT\n(max) SHUNT\n(7)\nTo minimize errors over temperature, select a low-drift shunt resistor.

In addition, INAs require external resistors to set their gain, which is not desirable for low-drift \napplications.

Some key \nconsiderations are:\n•Connect low-ESR, 0.1-μF ceramic bypass capacitors at V IN, VREF, and V BIAS of the REF2030.\n•Decouple other active devices in the system per the device specifications.\n•Using a solid ground plane helps distribute heat and reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise \npickup.\n•Place the external components as close to the device as possible. This configuration prevents parasitic errors \n(such as the Seebeck effect) from occurring.\n•Minimize trace length between the reference and bias connections to the INA and ADC to reduce noise \npickup.\n•Do not run sensitive analog traces in parallel with digital traces. Avoid crossing digital and analog traces if \npossible, and only make perpendicular crossings when absolutely necessary.\n12.2 Layout Example\nINA213\nCC CVREF\nVINREF\nDIG1Microcontroller\nA/D InputREF20xxVia \nto GND \nPlaneVia to \nInput Power\nAnalog Input VBIAS\nGND\nENREFV+\nGND\nOUTIN-IN+\nAINCC\nFigure 12-1.
