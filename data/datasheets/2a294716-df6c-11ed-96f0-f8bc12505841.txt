The input range is excellent formonitoring the current of a single-cell lithium-ion battery(Li+), which at full charge is 4.2V, typically 3.6V in nor-mal use, and less than 2.9V when ready to berecharged. The MAX9610 is ideal for many battery-powered, handheld devices because it uses only 1μAquiescent supply current to extend battery life. TheMAX9610 monitors current through a current-senseresistor and amplifies the voltage across that resistor.See the \nTypical Operating Circuit on page 1.\nThe MAX9610 is a unidirectional current-sense amplifier\nthat has a well-established history. An op amp is usedto force the current through an internal gain resistor atRS+ that has a value of R\n1, such that its voltage drop\nequals the voltage drop across an external sense resis-tor, R\nSENSE . There is an internal resistor at RS- with the\nsame value as R 1to minimize offset voltage. The cur-\nrent through R 1is sourced by a pFET. Its drain current\nis the same as its source current that flows through asecond gain resistor, R\nOUT. This produces an output\nvoltage, V OUT, whose magnitude is I LOAD x RSENSE x\nROUT/R1. The gain accuracy is based on the matching\nof the two gain resistors R 1and R OUT (see Table 1).\nTotal gain = 25V/V for the MAX9610T, 50V/V for theMAX9610F, and 100V/V for the MAX9610H.\nApplications Information\nChoosing the Sense Resistor\nChoose R SENSE based on the following criteria.\nVoltage Loss\nA high R SENSE value causes the power-source voltage\nto drop due to IR loss. For minimal voltage loss, use thelowest R\nSENSE value.OUT Swing vs. V RS+ and V SENSE\nThe MAX9610 is unique since the supply voltage is theinput common-mode voltage (the average voltage atRS+ and RS-). There is no separate V\nCCsupply voltage\ninput. Therefore, the OUT voltage swing is limited bythe minimum voltage at RS+. \nV\nOUT(MAX) = VRS+(MAX) - VSENSE(MAX) - VOH\nand\nVSENSE full scale should be less than V OUT/gain at the\nminimum RS+ voltage. For best performance with a3.6V supply voltage, select R\nSENSE to provide approxi-\nmately 120mV (gain of 25V/V), 60mV (gain of 50V/V), or30mV (gain of 100V/V) of sense voltage for the full-scale current in each application. These can beincreased by use of a higher minimum input voltage.\nAccuracy\nIn the linear region (V OUT < VOUT(MAX) ), there are two\ncomponents to accuracy: input offset voltage (V OS) and\nGain Error (GE). The MAX9610 has V OS= 500μV (max)\nand Gain Error of 0.5% (max). Use the following linearequation to calculate total error.\nV\nOUT= (Gain ± GE) x V SENSE ± (Gain x V OS)\nA high R SENSE value allows lower currents to be mea-\nsured more accurately because offsets are less signifi-cant when the sense voltage is larger.\nEfficiency and Power Dissipation\nAt high current levels, the I2R loss in R SENSE can be\nsignificant. Take this into consideration when choosingthe resistor value and its power dissipation (wattage)rating. Also, the sense resistor’s value might drift if it isallowed to heat up excessively. The precision V\nOSof\nthe MAX9610 allows the use of small sense resistors toreduce power dissipation and reduce hot spots.RV\nGISENSEOUT\nLOAD MAX=×()Pin Description\nPIN\nµDFN SC70NAME FUNCTION\n1 1, 2 GND Ground\n2, 5 — N.C.No Connection.

Either use a fourterminal current-sense resistor or use Kelvin (force andsense) PCB layout techniques.\nOptional Output Filter Capacitor\nWhen designing a system that uses a sample and holdstage in the analog-to-digital converter, the samplingcapacitor momentarily loads OUT and causes a drop inthe output voltage. If sampling time is very short (lessthan a microsecond), consider using a ceramic capaci-tor across OUT and GND to hold V\nOUT constant during\nsampling. This also decreases the small-signal band-width of the current-sense amplifier and reduces noiseat OUT.Typical Application Circuit\nBidirectional Application\nBattery-powered systems may require a precise bidi-rectional current-sense amplifier to accurately monitorthe battery’s charge and discharge currents.Measurements of the two separate outputs with respectto GND yield an accurate measure of the charge anddischarge currents, respectively (Figure 1).\nMAX9610P\nROUT\nGNDOUT OUT\nADC\nADCLOADRS- RS+RSENSEILOAD\n VBATT = 1.6V TO 5.5V\nMAX9610P\nROUT\nGNDRS- RS+\nR1 R1 R1 R1\nMICRO-\nCONTROLLERVDD = 3.3VTO WALL-CUBE/CHARGER\nFigure 1.
