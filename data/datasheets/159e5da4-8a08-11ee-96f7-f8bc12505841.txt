All address and control input signals are sampled \non the crossing of the positive edge of CK and negative edge of CK. Input and output data is \nreferenced to the crossing of CK and CK (both directions of crossing). Internal clock signals are \nderived from CK/ CK.\nCKE Input Clock Enable: CKE HIGH activates, and CKE LOW deactivates internal clock signals, and device \ninput buffers and output drivers. Taking CKE LOW provides PRECHARGE POWER-DOWN and \nSELF REFRESH operation (all banks idle), or ACTIVE POWERDOWN (row ACTIVE in any \nbank). CKE is synchronous for all functions except for SELF REFRESH EXIT, which is achieved \nasynchronously. Input buffers, excluding CK, CK and CKE, are disabled during power-down and \nself refresh mode which are contrived for low standby power consumption.\nCS Input Chip Select: CS enables (registered LOW) and disables (registered HIGH) the command \ndecoder. All commands are masked when CS is registered HIGH. CS provides for external bank \nselection on systems with multiple banks. CS is considered part of the command code.\nRAS, CAS, \nWEInput Command Inputs: RAS, CAS and WE (along with CS) define the command being entered.\nDM: x8;  \nLDM, UDM: \nx16;  \nDM0-DM3: \nx32Input Input Data Mask: DM is an input mask signal for write data. Input data is masked when DM is \nsampled HIGH along with that input data during a WRITE access. DM is sampled on both edges \nof DQS. Although DM pins are input-only, the DM loading matches the DQ and DQS loading.\nFor x16 devices, LDM corresponds to the data on DQ0-DQ7, UDM corresponds to the data on \nDQ8-DQ15.\nFor x32 devices, DM0 corresponds to the data on DQ0-DQ7, DM1 corresponds to the data on \nDQ8-DQ15, DM2 corresponds to the data on DQ16-DQ23, and DM3 corresponds to the data on \nDQ24-DQ31.\nBA0, BA1 Input Input Bank Address Inputs: BA0 and BA1 define to which bank an ACTIVE, READ, WRITE or \nPRECHARGE command is being applied.\nA [12:0] Input Address Inputs: provide the row address for ACTIVE commands, and the column address and \nAUTO PRECHARGE bit for READ / WRITE commands, to select one location out of the memory \narray in the respective bank. The address inputs also provide the opcode during a MODE \nREGISTER SET command. A12 is not used for x32.\nDQ: \nDQ0-DQ7: x8;  \nDQ0-DQ15: \nx16 \nDQ0-DQ31: \nx32I/O Data Bus: Input / Output\nDQS: x8:\nLDQS, UDQS \nx16:  \nDQS0-DQS3: \nx32I/O Data Strobe: Output with read data, input with write data. Edge-aligned with read data, centered \nwith write data. Used to capture write data.\nFor x16 device, LDQS corresponds to the data on DQ0-DQ7, UDQS corresponds to the data on \nDQ8-DQ15.\nFor x32 device, DQS0 corresponds to the data on DQ0-DQ7, DQS1 corresponds to the data on \nDQ8-DQ15, DQS2 corresponds to the data on DQ16-DQ23, and DQS3 corresponds to the data \non DQ24-DQ31.\nNC -- No Connect: Should be left unconnected.\nVREF Supply SSTL_2 reference voltage.\nVDDQ Supply I/O Power Supply.\nVSSQ Supply I/O Ground.\nVDD Supply Power Supply.\nVSS Supply Ground.\n10 Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc. \nRev.

This command is undefined and should not be \nused for Read with Auto Precharge enabled, and for Write bursts.\n5. If AP is Low, bank address determines which bank is to be precharged. If AP is High, all banks are precharged and BA0-\nBA1are don’t care.\n6. This command is AUTO REFRESH if CKE is High, and SELF REFRESH if CKE is low.\n7. All address inputs and I/O are ‘don't care’ except for CKE. Internal refresh counters control bank and row addressing.\n8.

The 256Mb devices contains: 268,435,456 bits. \nThe DDR SDRAM uses double data rate architecture to achieve high speed operation. The double data rate \narchitecture is essentially a 2n prefetch architecture with an interface designed to transfer two data words per clock \ncycle at the I/O pins. A single read or write access for the DDR SDRAM effectively consists of a single 2n-bit wide, \none clock cycle data transfer at the internal DRAM core and two corresponding n-bit wide, one-half-clock-cycle \ndata transfers at the I/O pins. Read and write accesses to the DDR SDRAM are burst oriented; accesses start at a \nselected location and continue for a programmed number of locations in a programmed sequence. Accesses begin \nwith the registration of an ACTIVE command, which is then followed by a READ or WRITE command. The address \nbits registered coincident with the ACTIVE command are used to select the bank and the row to be accessed. The \naddress bits registered coincident with the READ or WRITE command are used to select the bank and the starting \ncolumn location for the burst access. \nPrior to normal operation, the DDR SDRAM must be initialized. The following section provides detailed information \ncovering device initialization, register definition, command description and device operation\nINITIALIZATION\nDDR SDRAMs must be powered up and initialized in a predefined manner. Operations procedures other than those \nspecified may result in undefined operation. If there is any interruption to the device power, the initialization routine \nshould be followed. The steps to be followed for device initialization are listed below. The Initialization Flow diagram \nand the Initialization Flow sequence are shown in the following figures. \nThe Mode Register and Extended Mode Register do not have default values. If they are not programmed during the \ninitialization sequence, it may lead to unspecified operation. The clock stop feature is not available until the device has \nbeen properly initialized from Step 1 through 13.\n \n• Step 1: Apply VDD before or at the same time as VDDQ.\n• Step 2: CKE must maintain LVCMOS Low until VREF is stable. Apply VDDQ before applying VTT and VREF .\n• Step 3: There must be at least 200 μs of valid clocks before any command may be given to the DRAM. During this \ntime NOP or DESELECT commands must be issued on the command bus and CKE should be brought HIGH.\n• Step 4: Issue a PRECHARGE ALL command.\n• Step 5: Provide NOPs or DESELECT commands for at least tRP time.\n• Step 6: Issue EMRS command\n• Step 7: Issue MRS command, load the base mode register and to reset the DLL. Set the desired operating modes.\n• Step 8: Provide NOPs or DESELECT commands for at least tMRD time.\n• Step 9: Issue a PRECHARGE ALL command\n• Step 10: Issue 2 or more AUTO REFRESH cycles\n• Step 11: Issue MRS command with the reset DLL bit deactivated to program operating parameters without resetting \nthe DLL\n• Step 12: Provide NOP or DESELECT commands for at least tMRD time.\n• Step 13: The DRAM has been properly initialized and is ready for any valid command.\n \n14 Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc. \nRev.

VTT is not applied directly to the device, however tVTD must be greater than or equal to zero to avoid device latch--up.\n2.  tMRD is required before any command can be applied, and 200 cycles of CK are required before any executable command \ncan be applied\n3.

This definition includes \nthe definition of a burst length, a burst type, and a CAS latency. The Mode Register is programmed via the MODE \nREGISTER SET command (with BA0=0 and BA1=0) and will retain the stored information until it is reprogrammed, \nor the device loses power.  Mode Register bits A0-A2 specify the burst length, A3 the type of burst (sequential or \ninterleave), A4-A6 the CAS latency, and A8 DLL reset. A logic 0 should be programmed to all the undefined addresses \nbits to ensure future compatibility.  The Mode Register must be loaded when all banks are idle and no bursts are in \nprogress, and the controller must wait the specified time tMRD before initiating any subsequent operation. Violating \neither of these requirements will result in unspecified operation.

The burst length determines the maximum number of column locations that can be accessed for \na given READ or WRITE command. Burst lengths of 2, 4, or 8 locations are available for both the sequential and the \ninterleaved burst types.\nNotes:\n1. For a burst length of two, A1-An selects the two data element block; A0 selects the first access within the block.\n2. For a burst length of four, A2-An selects the four data element block; A0-A1 selects the first access within the block.\n3. For a burst length of eight, A3-An selects the eight data element block; A0-A2 selects the first access within the block.\n4. Whenever a boundary of the block is reached within a given sequence, the following access wraps within the block.BURST DEFINITION\n \nBurst \nLengthStarting Column Address Order of Accesses Within a Burst\nType = Sequential Type = Interleaved\n2A0\n0 0-1 0-1\n1 1-0 1-0\n4A1 A0\n0 0 0-1-2-3 0-1-2-3\n0 1 1-2-3-0 1-0-3-2\n1 0 2-3-0-1 2-3-0-1\n1 1 3-0-1-2 3-2-1-0\n8A2 A1 A0\n0 0 0 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7\n0 0 1 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-0  1-0-3-2-5-4-7-6\n0 1  0  2-3-4-5-6-7-0-1 2-3-0-1-6-7-4-5\n0  1 1  3-4-5-6-7-0-1-2 3-2-1-0-7-6-5-4\n1 0 0 4-5-6-7-0-1-2-3 4-5-6-7-0-1-2-3\n1 0 1 5-6-7-0-1-2-3-4 5-4-7-6-1-0-3-2\n1 1 0 6-7-0-1-2-3-4-5 6-7-4-5-2-3-0-1\n1 1 1 7-0-1-2-3-4-5-6 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-0\nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc.  17\nRev.

All \naccesses for that burst take place within the block, meaning that the burst will wrap within the block if a boundary is \nreached. \nThe block is uniquely selected by A1-An when the burst length is set to two, by A2-An when the burst length is set \nto 4, by A3-An when the burst length is set to 8. An is the most significant column address bit, which depends if the \ndevice is x8, x16 or x32. An = A9 for x8, An = A8 for x16 and An = A9 for x32. The programmed burst length applies to \nboth read and write bursts.\nBURST TYPE\nAccesses within a given burst may be programmed to be either sequential or interleaved; this is referred to as the \nburst type and is selected via bit A3. \nThe ordering of accesses within a burst is determined by the burst length, the burst type and the starting column \naddress.\nREAD LATENCY\nThe READ latency, or CAS latency, is the delay between the registration of a READ command and the availability of \nthe first piece of output data. \nIf a READ command is registered at a clock edge n and the latency is 3 clocks, the first data element will be valid at \nn + 2tCK + tAC. If a READ command is registered at a clock edge n and the latency is 2 clocks, the first data element \nwill be valid at n + tCK + tAC.\nOPERATING MODE\nThe normal operating mode is selected by issuing a Mode Register Set command with bits A7 to An each set to zero, \nand bits A0 to A6 set to the desired values. A DLL reset is initiated by issuing a Mode Register Set command with \nbits A7 and A9 to An each set to zero, bit A8 set to one, and bits A0 to A6 set to the desired values. A Mode Register \nSet command issued to reset the DLL must always be followed by a Mode Register Set command to select normal \noperating mode (A8=0).\nAll other combinations of values for A7 to An are reserved for future use and/or test modes. Test modes and reserved \nstates should not be used because unknown operation or incompatibility with future versions may result.\n18 Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc. \nRev.

The Extended Mode Register is \nprogrammed via the MODE REGISTER SET command (with BA1=0 and BA0=1) and will retain the stored information \nuntil it is reprogrammed,  or the device loses power. The Extended Mode Register must be loaded when all banks \nare idle and no bursts are in progress, and the controller must wait the specified time tMRD before initiating any \nsubsequent operation. Violating either of these requirements will result in unspecified operation. Reserved states \nshould not be used, as unknown operation or incompatibility with future versions may result.\nDLL Enable/Disable\nThe DLL must be enabled for normal operation. DLL enable is required during power-up initialization, and upon \nreturning to normal operation after having disabled the DLL for the purpose of debug or evaluation (upon exiting Self \nRefresh Mode, the DLL is enabled automatically). Any time the DLL is enabled a DLL Reset must follow and 200 clock \ncycles must occur before any executable command can be issued.\nOUTPUT DRIVE STRENGTH (DS)\nThe normal drive strength for all outputs is specified to be SSTL_2, Class II. This DRAM also supports a reduced \ndriver strength option, intended for lighter load and/or point-to-point environments.\nEXTENDED MODE REGISTER\nBA1 BA0 A122 A11 A10 A9 A8 A7 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0\n \nA0DLL\n0Enable\n1DisableAddress Bus (Ax)\nExt.

Tests for AC timing, IDD, and electrical, AC and DC characteristics, may be conducted at nominal reference/supply voltage \nlevels, but the related specifications and device operation are guaranteed for the full voltage range specified.\n3. AC timing and IDD tests may use a VIL to VIH swing of up to 1.5V in the test environment, but input timing is still referenced to \nVREF (or to the crossing point for CK//CK), and parameter specifications are guaranteed for the specified AC input levels un-\nder normal use conditions. The minimum slew rate for the input signals is 1V/ns in the range between VIL(AC) and VIH(AC).\n4. The AC and DC input level specifications are as defined in the SSTL_2 Standard (i.e. the receiver will effectively switch as a \nresult of the signal crossing the AC input level, and will remain in that state as long as the signal does not ring back above \n(below) the DC input LOW (HIGH) level.\n5. VREF is expected to be equal to 0.5*VddQ of the transmitting device, and to track variations in the DC level of the same. \nPeak-to-peak noise on VREF may not exceed +2% of the DC value.\n6. VTT is not applied directly to the device. VTT is a system supply for signal termination resistors, is expected to be set equal to \nVREF , and must track variations in the DC level of VREF .\n7. VID is the magnitude of the difference between the input level on CLK and the input level on /CLK.\n8. The value of VIX is expected to equal 0.5*VddQ of the transmitting device and must track variations in the DC level of the \nsame.\n9. IDD specifications are tested after the device is properly initialized.\n10. The CLK//CLK input reference level (for timing referenced to CLK//CLK) is the point at which CLK and /CLK cross; the input \nreference level for signals other than CLK//CLK, is VREF .\n11. Inputs are not recognized as valid until VREF stabilizes. Exception: during the period before VREF stabilizes, CKE< 0.3VddQ \nis recognized as LOW.\n12. tHZ and tLZ transitions occur in the same access time windows as valid data transitions. These parameters are not refer-\nenced to a specific voltage level, but specify when the device output is no longer driving (HZ), or begins driving (LZ).\n13. The maximum limit for tWPRES is not a device limit. The device will operate with a greater value for this parameter, but sys-\ntem performance (bus turnaround) will degrade accordingly.\n14. The specific requirement is that DQS be valid (HIGH, LOW, or at some point on a valid transition) on or before this CLK \nedge. A valid transition is defined as monotonic, and meeting the input slew rate specifications of the device. When no writes \nwere previously in progress on the bus, DQS will be transitioning from High-Z to logic LOW. If a previous write was in prog-\nress, DQS could be HIGH, LOW, or transitioning from HIGH to LOW at this time, depending on tDQSS.\n15. A maximum of eight AUTO REFRESH commands can be posted to any given DDR SDRAM device.\n16. tXPRD should be 200 tCLK in the condition of the unstable CLK operation during the power down mode.\n17. For command/address and CK & /CK slew rate > 1.0V/ns.\n18. For slew rates less than 1 V/ns and greater than or equal to 0.5 V/ns. If the slew rate is less than 0.5 V/ns, timing must be\n derated: t iS has an additional 50ps per each 100mV/ns reduction in slew rate from the 500 mV/ns. t ih has nothing added. If \nthe slew rate exceeds 4.5 V/ns, functionality is uncertain. For operation at 166mHz or faster, slew rates must be greater than \nor equal to 0.5 V/ns.\n19. To maintain a valid level, the transitioning edge of the input must:\n a. Sustain a constant slew rate from the current AC level through to the target AC level, VIL(AC) or VIH(AC).\n b. Reach at least the target AC level.\n c. After the AC target level is reached, continue to maintain at least the target DC level, VIL(DC) or VIH(DC).\n20. VIH overshoot: VIH, max = VDDO+1.5V for a pulse width ≤ 3ns, and the pulse width can not be greater than 1/3 of the cycle    \n rate. VII undershoot: VIL, min= -1.5V for a pulse width ≤ 3ns, and the pulse wifth can not be greater than 1/3 of the cycle rate.\n21. Min (tCL,tCH) refers to the smaller of the actual clock low time and the actual clock high time as provided to the device.\n22. For A2 temperature grade with T A > 85°C: IDD2F , IDD3N, and IDD7 are derated to 10% above these values; IDD2P and \nIDD6 are derated to 20% above these values.Parameter/Condition Symbol Min Max Units\nInput high (logic 1) voltage, DQ, DQS, and DM signals VIH(AC) VREF+0.310 1.5 V\nInput low (logic 0) voltage, DQ, DQS, and DM signals VIL(AC) - 1.5 V\nInput Differential Voltage, CK and CK inputs VID(AC) 0.7 VDDQ+0.6 V\nInput Crossing Point Voltage, CK and CK inputs VIX(AC) 0.5*VDDQ-0.2 0.5+VDDQ+0.2 V\nI/O reference voltage VREF(AC) 0.51*VDDQ 4.5 V-nsAC Input Operating Conditions  \n(VDD = VDDQ = 2.5 ± 0.2V, VSS= VSSQ= 0V, output open, unless otherwise noted.)\nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc.  27\nRev.
