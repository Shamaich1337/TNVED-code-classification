### Component Summary: PDTC114ET

**General Description:**
The PDTC114ET is a 50V, 100mA NPN resistor-equipped transistor (RET) packaged in a compact SOT23 surface-mounted device (SMD). It features built-in bias resistors (R1 = 10 kΩ, R2 = 10 kΩ), simplifying circuit design and reducing component count.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Collector-Emitter Voltage (VCEO): 50 V
  - Collector-Base Voltage (VCBO): 50 V
  - Emitter-Base Voltage (VEBO): 10 V (positive), -40 V (negative)
  
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Current (IO): 100 mA
  
- **Power Consumption:**
  - Total Power Dissipation (Ptot): 250 mW (at ambient temperature ≤ 25 °C)
  
- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Junction Temperature (Tj): -65 °C to 150 °C
  - Ambient Temperature (Tamb): -65 °C to 150 °C
  
- **Package Type:**
  - SOT23 (3 terminals, dimensions: 2.9 mm x 1.3 mm x 1 mm)
  
- **Special Features:**
  - Built-in bias resistors simplify circuit design.
  - Reduces component count and pick-and-place costs.
  
- **Moisture Sensitive Level:**
  - JEDEC J-STD-020E: Not specified in the provided data.

**Description:**
The PDTC114ET is an NPN transistor designed for digital applications, particularly in automotive and industrial segments. Its built-in resistors allow for easier integration into circuits, making it a cost-effective alternative to traditional transistors like the BC847 series.

**Typical Applications:**
- Digital applications in automotive and industrial electronics.
- Controlling IC inputs.
- Switching loads.
- Suitable for applications where space and component count are critical, such as in compact electronic devices.

This transistor is particularly useful in designs that require reliable switching and control functions while minimizing the number of external components needed.
