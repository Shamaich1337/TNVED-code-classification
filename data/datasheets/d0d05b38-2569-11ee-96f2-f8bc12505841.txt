Easy\nmemory expansion is provided by an active LOW Chip Enable\n(CE), an active LOW Output Enable (OE ), and three-state\ndrivers. This device has an aut omatic power-down feature that\nsignificantly reduces power consumption when deselected. \nWriting to the device is accomplished by taking Chip Enable (CE )\nand Write Enable (WE ) inputs LOW. Data on the eight I/O pins\n(I/O0 through I/O7) is then written into the location specified on\nthe address pins (A0 through A16).\nReading from the device is accomplished by taking Chip Enable\n(CE) and Output Enable (OE ) LOW while forcing Write Enable\n(WE) HIGH. Under these conditions, the contents of the memory\nlocation specified by the address pi ns will appear on the I/O pins.\nThe eight input/output pins (I/O0 through I/O7) are placed in a\nhigh-impedance state when the device is deselected (CE  HIGH),\nthe outputs are disabled (OE  HIGH), or during a write operation\n(CE LOW, and WE  LOW).\nThe CY7C1018DV33/CY7C1019DV33 are available in Pb-free\n32-pin 400-Mil wide Molded SOJ, 32-pin TSOP II and 48-ball\nVFBGA packages.\nFor a complete list of related documentation, click here .\nA1\nA2\nA3\nA4A5\nA6\nA7\nA8\nCOLUMN\nDECODERROW DECODER\nSENSE AMPSINPUTBUFFER\nPOWER\nDOWN WE\nOEI/O0\nCEI/O1\nI/O2\nI/O3\nI/O7I/O6I/O5I/O4A0\nA13A11\nA12A9\nA10128K × 8\nARRAY\nA14A15A16Logic Block Diagram\nCY7C1018DV33\nCY7C1019DV33\nDocument Number: 38-05481 Rev. *J Page 2 of 20Contents\nSelection Guide ................................................................3\nPin Configurations ...........................................................3Maximum Ratings .............................................................4\nOperating Range ...............................................................4\nElectrical Characteristics .................................................4\nCapacitance ......................................................................5\nThermal Resistance ..........................................................5AC Test Loads and Waveforms .......................................5\nData Retention Characteristics .......................................6\nData Retention Waveform ................................................6Switching Characteristics ................................................7\nSwitching Waveforms ......................................................8\nTruth Table ......................................................................11Ordering Information ...................................................... 12\nOrdering Code Definitions ..... .................................... 12\nPackage Diagrams .......................................................... 13\nAcronyms ........................................................................ 17\nDocument Conventions ................................................. 17\nUnits of Measure ....................................................... 17\nDocument History Page ................................................. 18Sales, Solutions, and Legal Information ...................... 20\nWorldwide Sales and Design S upport ......... .............. 20\nProducts .................................................................... 20PSoC® Solutions ...................................................... 20\nCypress Developer Community ................................. 20\nTechnical Support ................. .................................... 20\nCY7C1018DV33\nCY7C1019DV33\nDocument Number: 38-05481 Rev. *J Page 3 of 20Selection Guide\nDescription -10 (Industrial) Unit\nMaximum Access Time 10 ns\nMaximum Operating Current 60 mA\nMaximum Standby Current 3m A\nPin Configurations\nFigure 1.  48-ball VFBGA pinout (Top View) [1]\nFigure 2.  32-pin SOJ / TSOP II pinout (Top View)WEVCC\nA9 A16NCA4A2\nA1 CE\nNCI/O0\nI/O1A5\nA0\nNC\nNCNC\nI/O2\nI/O3VSS\nA10A3OE\nVSSNCI/O7 NCNC\nA13A7 A6 NC\nVCCI/O6 NC\nNC\nNC\nI/O4I/O5\nA8A11A14\nA12A15 NC\nNC NC3 2 6 5 4 1\nD\nEBA\nC\nF\nG\nHNCTop ViewSOJ/TSOPI\n1\n2\n3\n45\n6\n7\n89\n10\n11\n14 192024\n23\n22\n212528\n27\n26\n12\n132932\n31\n30\n1615\n1718\nA7A1\nA2\nA3\nCE\nI/O0\nI/O1\nVCC\nI/O2A0\nA4\nA5\nA6I/O3\nWEVSS\nWEVCC\nA9 A16NCA4A2\nA1 CE A5\nA0\nA3\nVSSNCI/O7NC\nA13A7 A6\nI/O6 NC\nNC\nNC\nI/O4I/O5\nA8A11A14\nA12A15\nNCD\nEBA\nC\nF\nG\nHNC1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n910\n11\n14 192024\n23\n22\n212528\n27\n26\n12\n132932\n31\n30\n1615\n1718\nA7A1\nA2\nA3\nCE\nI/O0\nI/O1\nVCCA13A16\nA15\nOE\nI/O7\nI/O6\nA12\nA11\nA10\nA9I/O2A0\nA4\nA5\nA6I/O4VCC\nI/O5\nA8I/O3\nWEVSSA14\nVSS\nNote\n1.

Test conditions assume signal transition ti me of 3 ns or less, timing reference levels of 1.5 V, input pulse levels of 0 to 3 .0 V.\n8. tPOWER  gives the minimum amount of time that the power supply should be at typical VCC values until the first memory access can be performed.\n9. At any given temperature and voltage condition, tHZCE is less than tLZCE, tHZOE  is less than tLZOE, and tHZWE  is less than tLZWE  for any given device.\n10. tHZOE, tHZCE, and tHZWE  are specified with a load capacitance of 5 pF as in Figure 3 on page 5  (c). Transition is measured when the outputs enter a high impedance state.\n11. This parameter is guaranteed by design and is not tested.\n12. The internal write time of the memory is defined by the overlap of CE  LOW and WE  LOW. CE  and WE  must be LOW to initiate a write, and the transition of any of these signals \ncan terminate the write. The input data set-up and hold timing should be referenced to the leading edge of the signal that term inates the write.\n13. The minimum write cycle time for Write Cycle no. 3 (WE  controlled, OE  LOW) is the sum of tHZWE  and tSD.\nCY7C1018DV33\nCY7C1019DV33\nDocument Number: 38-05481 Rev. *J Page 8 of 20Switching Waveforms\nFigure 5.
