**Description:**
The ZX85-12G-S+ is a Bias-Tee component designed for RF applications. It allows for the simultaneous transmission of RF signals and DC power through a single coaxial cable. This component is particularly useful in applications where DC power needs to be supplied to devices such as amplifiers, laser diodes, and active antennas while maintaining RF signal integrity.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Biasing Amplifiers:** Providing necessary DC power to RF amplifiers while allowing RF signals to pass through.
- **Biasing of Laser Diodes:** Supplying power to laser diodes in optical applications.
- **Biasing of Active Antennas:** Enabling active antennas to function by providing the required DC voltage.
- **DC Blocking:** Preventing DC signals from interfering with RF signals in various circuits.
- **Test Accessories:** Used in laboratory settings for testing RF components and systems.

This component is ideal for applications in telecommunications, satellite communications, and other RF signal processing environments where both RF and DC signals need to be managed effectively.
