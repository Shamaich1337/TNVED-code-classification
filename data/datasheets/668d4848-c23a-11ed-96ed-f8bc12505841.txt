So when an IEC 61000-4-2 surge occurs on data line, due to the rise\ntime of this spike (t r = 1 ns), the voltage V CL has an extra value equal to L I/O.dl/dt + L GND.dI/dt.\nThe dI/dt is calculated as:\ndI/dt = I p/tr = 24 A/ns\nThe overvoltage due to the parasitic inductances is:\nLI/O.dl/dt = L GND.dI/dt = 6 nH x 24 A/ns = 144 V\nBy taking into account the effect of these parasitic inductances due to unsuitable layout, the clamping voltage will\nbe:\nVCL+ = +31.2 + 144 + 144 = 319.2 V\nVCL- = -13.1 - 144 - 144 = -301.1 V\nWe can significantly reduce this phenomena with simple layout optimization. It is for this reason that some\nrecommendations have to be followed (see ).USBLC6-2\nTechnical information\nDS4260  - Rev 7 page 4/20\nFigure 5.

In the same way, with the rail to rail topology, the track from data lines to I/O pins, from VCC to VBUS pin\nand from GND plane to GND pin must be as short as possible to avoid overvoltages due to parasitic phenomena\n(see Figure 6. ESD behavior: layout optimization  and Figure 5. ESD behavior: parasitic phenomena due to\nunsuitable layout  for layout consideration).\nFigure 6.

The coupling factor (β12 or β21) increases\nwhen the gap across lines decreases, particularly in silicon dice. In the above example the expected signal on\nload R L2 is α 2VG2, in fact the real voltage at this point has got an extra value β 21VG1. This part of the V G1 signal\nrepresents the effect of the crosstalk phenomenon of the line 1 on the line 2. This phenomenon has to be taken\ninto account when the drivers impose fast digital data or high frequency analog signals in the disturbing line. The\nperturbed line will be more affected if it works with low voltage signal or high load impedance (few kΩ).\nFigure 11.

Analog crosstalk measurements  shows the measurement circuit for the analog application. In usual\nfrequency range of analog signals (up to 240 MHz) the effect on disturbed line is less than -55 dB (see\nFigure 12.

The frequency response ( Figure 4. Frequency response ) gives attenuation information and shows that\nthe USBLC6-2 is well suitable for data line transmission up to 480 Mbit/s while it works as a filter for undesirable\nsignals like GSM (900 MHz) frequencies, for instance.USBLC6-2\nCrosstalk behavior\nDS4260  - Rev 7 page 8/20\n2.5 Application examples\nFigure 13.

- **Ethernet Ports:** Suitable for 10/100 Mb/s Ethernet applications.
- **SIM Card Protection:** Protects SIM card interfaces from ESD.
- **Video Line Protection:** Safeguards video signal lines against ESD.
- **Portable Electronics:** Ideal for use in battery-powered devices due to low leakage current.

The USBLC6-2SC6 is particularly beneficial in applications where high-speed data transmission is critical, and where devices are exposed to potentially damaging ESD events. Its compact size and low capacitance make it suitable for space-constrained designs while ensuring reliable operation.
