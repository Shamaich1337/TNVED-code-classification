The Write-Protect ( WP) and Hold ( HOLD) pins should be driven high or low as appropriate.\n2.1 Chip Select ( CS)\nThe AT25512 is selected when the Chip Select ( CS) pin is low. When the device is not selected, data will not be\naccepted via the Serial Data Input (SI) pin, and the Serial Output (SO) pin will remain in a high ‑impedance state.\nTo ensure robust operation, the CS pin should follow V CC upon power-up. It is therefore recommended to connect CS\nto V CC using a pull-up resistor (less than or equal to 10 kΩ). After power-up, a low level on CS is required prior to any\nsequence being initiated.\n2.2 Serial Data Output (SO)\nThe Serial Data Output (SO) pin is used to transfer data out of the AT25512. During a read sequence, data is shifted\nout on this pin after the falling edge of the Serial Data Clock (SCK).\n2.3 Write-Protect ( WP)\nThe Write-Protect ( WP) pin will allow normal read/write operations when held high. When the WP pin is brought low\nand the WPEN bit is set to a logic ‘ 1’, all write operations to the STATUS register are inhibited. WP going low while\nCS is still low will interrupt a write operation to the STATUS register. If the internal write cycle has already been\ninitiated, WP going low will have no effect on any write operation to the STATUS register. The WP pin function is\nblocked when the WPEN bit in the STATUS register is set to a logic ‘ 0’. This will allow the user to install the AT25512\nin a system with the WP pin tied to ground and still be able to write to the STATUS register. All WP pin functions are\nenabled when the WPEN bit is set to a logic ‘ 1’.\n2.4 Ground\nThe ground reference for the power supply. GND should be connected to the system ground.\n2.5 Serial Data Input (SI)\nThe Serial Data Input (SI) pin is used to transfer data into the device. It receives instructions, addresses and data.\nData is latched on the rising edge of the Serial Data Clock (SCK). AT25512\nPin Description\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006218B-page 5\n2.6 Serial Data Clock (SCK)\nThe Serial Data Clock (SCK) pin is used to synchronize the communication between a host and the AT25512.\nInstructions, addresses or data present on the Serial Data Input (SI) pin is latched in on the rising edge of SCK, while\noutput on the Serial Data Output (SO) pin is clocked out on the falling edge of SCK.\n2.7 Device Power Supply (V CC)\nThe Device Power Supply (V CC) pin is used to supply the source voltage to the device. Operations at invalid V CC\nvoltages may produce spurious results and should not be attempted. AT25512\nPin Description\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006218B-page 6\n3.

Upon power-up, the device will not respond to any instructions\nuntil the V CC level crosses the internal voltage threshold (V POR) that brings the device out of Reset and into Standby\nmode.\nThe system designer must ensure the instructions are not sent to the device until the V CC supply has reached a\nstable value greater than or equal to the minimum V CC level. Additionally, once the V CC is greater than or equal to the\nminimum V CC level, the bus host must wait at least t PUP before sending the first instruction to the device. See Table\n4-4 for the values associated with these power-up parameters. AT25512\nElectrical Characteristics\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.

These parameters are characterized but they are not 100% tested in production.\nIf an event occurs in the system where the V CC level supplied to the AT25512 drops below the maximum V POR level\nspecified, it is recommended that a full-power cycle sequence be performed by first driving the V CC pin to GND in less\nthan 1 ms, waiting at least the minimum t POFF time and then performing a new power-up sequence in compliance\nwith the requirements defined in this section.\n4.6.2 Pin Capacitance\nTable 4-5.\u2000Pin Capacitance(1,2)\nSymbol Test Condition Max.

Performance is determined through characterization and the qualification process.\n4.6.4 Software Reset\nThe SPI interface of the AT25512 can be reset by toggling the CS input. If the CS line is already in the Active state, it\nmust complete a transition from the Inactive state (≥V IH) to the Active state (≤V IL) and then back to the Inactive state\n(≥VIH) without sending clocks on the SCK line. Upon completion of this sequence, the device will be ready to receive\na new opcode on the SI line.\n4.6.5 Device Default State at Power-Up\nThe AT25512 default state upon power-up consists of:\n• Standby Power mode\n• A high-to-low-level transition on CS is required to enter Active state\n• Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the STATUS register = 0\n•Ready/Busy bit in the STATUS register = 0, indicating the device is ready to accept a new command\n• Device is not selected AT25512\nElectrical Characteristics\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006218B-page 13\n• Not in Hold condition\n• WPEN, BP1 and BP0 bits in the STATUS register are unchanged from their previous state due to the fact that\nthey are nonvolatile values\n4.6.6 Device Default Condition\nThe AT25512 is shipped from Microchip to the customer with the EEPROM array set to an all FFh data pattern (logic\n‘1’ state). The Write-Protect Enable bit in the STATUS register is set to logic ‘ 0’ and the Block Write ‑Protect bits in the\nSTATUS register are set to logic ‘ 0’. AT25512\nElectrical Characteristics\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006218B-page 14\n5. Device Operation\nThe AT25512 is controlled by a set of instructions that are sent from a host controller, commonly referred to as the\nSPI Host. The SPI Host communicates with the AT25512 via the SPI bus which is comprised of four signal lines: Chip\nSelect ( CS), Serial Data Clock (SCK), Serial Data Input (SI) and Serial Data Output (SO).\nThe SPI protocol defines a total of four modes of operation (Mode 0, 1, 2 or 3) with each mode differing in respect\nto the SCK polarity and phase and how the polarity and phase control the flow of data on the SPI bus. The AT25512\nsupports the two most common modes, SPI Modes 0 and 3. With SPI Modes 0 and 3, data is always latched in on\nthe rising edge of SCK and always output on the falling edge of SCK. The only difference between SPI Modes 0\nand 3 is the polarity of the SCK signal when in the Inactive state (when the SPI Host is in Standby mode and not\ntransferring any data). SPI Mode 0 is defined as a low SCK while CS is not asserted (at V CC) and SPI Mode 3 has\nSCK high in the Inactive state. The SCK Idle state must match when the CS is deasserted both before and after the\ncommunication sequence in SPI Mode 0 and 3. The figures in this document depict Mode 0 with a solid line on SCK\nwhile CS is inactive and Mode 3 with a dotted line.\nFigure 5-1.\u2000SPI Mode 0 and Mode 3\nSOSISCKCS\nMSb LSb\nMSb LSbMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\n5.1 Interfacing the AT25512 on the SPI Bus\nCommunication to and from the AT25512 must be initiated by the SPI Host device, such as a microcontroller. The\nSPI Host device must generate the serial clock for the AT25512 on the Serial Data Clock (SCK) pin. The AT25512\nalways operates as a client due to the fact that the SCK is always an input.\n5.1.1 Selecting the Device\nThe AT25512 is selected when the Chip Select ( CS) pin is low. When the device is not selected, data will not be\naccepted via the Serial Data Input (SI) pin, and the Serial Data Output (SO) pin will remain in a high ‑impedance state.\n5.1.2 Sending Data to the Device\nThe AT25512 uses the SI pin to receive information. All instructions, addresses and data input bytes are clocked into\nthe device with the Most Significant bit (MSb) first. The SI pin samples on the first rising edge of the SCK line after\nthe CS has been asserted.\n5.1.3 Receiving Data from the Device\nData output from the device is transmitted on the SO pin, with the MSb output first. The SO data is latched on the\nfirst falling edge of SCK after the instruction has been clocked into the device, such as the Read from Memory Array\n(READ ) and Read STATUS Register ( RDSR ) instructions. See Read Sequence  for more details. AT25512\nDevice Operation\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006218B-page 15\n5.2 Device Opcodes\n5.2.1 Serial Opcode\nAfter the device is selected by driving CS low, the first byte will be received on the SI pin. This byte contains the\nopcode that defines the operation to be performed. Refer to Table 6-1  for a list of all opcodes that the AT25512 will\nrespond to.\n5.2.2 Invalid Opcode\nIf an invalid opcode is received, no data will be shifted into AT25512 and the SO pin will remain in a high ‑impedance\nstate until the falling edge of CS is detected again. This will reinitialize the serial communication.\n5.3 Hold Function\nThe Suspend Serial Input ( HOLD) pin is used to pause the serial communication with the device without having to\nstop or reset the clock sequence. The Hold mode, however, does not have an effect on the internal write cycle.\nTherefore, if a write cycle is in progress, asserting the HOLD pin will not pause the operation and the write cycle will\ncontinue to completion.\nThe Hold mode can only be entered while the CS pin is asserted. The Hold mode is activated by asserting the HOLD\npin during the SCK low pulse. If the HOLD pin is asserted during the SCK high pulse, then the Hold mode will not be\nstarted until the beginning of the next SCK low pulse. The device will remain in the Hold mode as long as the HOLD\npin and CS pin are asserted.\nWhile in Hold mode, the SO pin will be in a high-impedance state. In addition, both the SI pin and the SCK pin will be\nignored. The Write-Protect ( WP) pin, however, can still be asserted or deasserted while in the Hold mode.\nTo end the Hold mode and resume serial communication, the HOLD pin must be deasserted during the SCK low\npulse. If the HOLD pin is deasserted during the SCK high pulse, then the Hold mode will not end until the beginning\nof the next SCK low pulse.\nIf the CS pin is deasserted while the HOLD pin is still asserted, then any operation that may have been started will be\naborted and the device will reset the WEL bit in the STATUS register back to the logic ‘ 0’ state.\nFigure 5-2.\u2000Hold Mode\nHOLDSCKCS\nHold Hold Hold AT25512\nDevice Operation\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.

When the WP pin is brought\nlow and WPEN bit is a logic ‘ 1’, all write operations to the STATUS register are inhibited. The WP pin going low while\nCS is still low will interrupt a Write STATUS Register ( WRSR ). If the internal write cycle has already been initiated, WP\ngoing low will have no effect on any write operation to the STATUS register. The WP pin function is blocked when the\nWPEN bit in the STATUS register is a logic ‘ 0’. This will allow the user to install the AT25512 device in a system with\nthe WP pin tied to ground and still be able to write to the STATUS register. All WP pin functions are enabled when the\nWPEN bit is set to a logic ‘ 1’. AT25512\nDevice Operation\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006218B-page 17\n6. Device Commands and Addressing\nThe AT25512 is designed to interface directly with the synchronous Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). The AT25512\nutilizes an 8 ‑bit instruction register. The list of instructions and their operation codes are contained in Table 6-1 . All\ninstructions, addresses and data are transferred with the MSb first and start with a high ‑to ‑low CS transition.\nTable 6-1.\u2000Instruction Set for the AT25512\nInstruction Name Instruction Format Operates On Operation Description\nWREN 0000 X110 STATUS Register Set Write Enable Latch (WEL)\nWRDI 0000 X100 STATUS Register Reset Write Enable Latch (WEL)\nRDSR 0000 X101 STATUS Register Read STATUS Register\nWRSR 0000 X001 STATUS Register Write STATUS Register\nREAD 0000 X011 Memory Array Read from Memory Array\nWRITE 0000 X010 Memory Array Write to Memory Array\n6.1 STATUS Register Bit Definition and Function\nThe AT25512 includes an 8 ‑bit STATUS register. The STATUS register bits modulate various features of the device\nas shown in Table 6-2  and Table 6-3 . These bits can be changed by specific instructions that are detailed in the\nfollowing sections.\nTable 6-2.\u2000STATUS Register Format\nBit 7 Bit 6 Bit 5 Bit 4 Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0\nWPEN X X X BP1 BP0 WEL RDY/BSY\nTable 6-3.\u2000STATUS Register Bit Definition\nBit Name Type Description\n7 WPEN Write-Protect Enable R/W0See Table 6-5  (Factory Default)\n1See Table 6-5  (Factory Default)\n6:4 RFU Reserved for Future Use R0Reads as zeros when the device is not in a write cycle\n1Reads as ones when the device is in a write cycle\n3:2BP1\nBP0Block Write Protection R/W00No array write protection (Factory Default)\n01Quarter array write protection (see Table 6-4 )\n10Half array write protection (see Table 6-4 )\n11Entire array write protection (see Table 6-4 )\n1 WEL Write Enable Latch R0Device is not write enabled (Power-up Default)\n1Device is write enabled\n0RDY/BSY Ready/Busy Status R0Device is ready for a new sequence\n1Device is busy with an internal operation AT25512\nDevice Commands and Addressing\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006218B-page 18\n6.2 Read STATUS Register ( RDSR )\nThe Read STATUS Register ( RDSR ) instruction provides access to the STATUS register. The ready/busy and write\nenable status of the device can be determined by the RDSR  instruction. Similarly, the Block Write-Protect (BP1, BP0)\nbits indicate the extent of memory array protection employed. The STATUS register is read by asserting the CS pin,\nfollowed by sending in a 05h opcode on the SI pin. Upon completion of the opcode, the device will return the 8 ‑bit\nSTATUS register value on the SO pin.\nFigure 6-1.\u2000RDSR Waveform\nSOSCKCS\n0  1   2   3    4    5     6      7       8       9        10       11       12       13       14       15\nHigh-ImpedanceSI\nMSbRDSR Opcode (05h)\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\nD7      D6      D5      D4       D3      D2       D1      D0 \nMSbSTATUS Register Data Out\n6.3 Write Enable ( WREN ) and Write Disable ( WRDI )\nEnabling and disabling writing to the STATUS register and EEPROM array is accomplished through the Write Enable\n(WREN ) instruction and the Write Disable ( WRDI ) instruction. These functions change the status of the WEL bit in the\nSTATUS register.\n6.3.1 Write Enable Instruction ( WREN )\nThe Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit of the STATUS register must be set to a logic ‘ 1’ prior to each Write STATUS\nRegister ( WRSR ) and Write to Memory Array ( WRITE ) instructions. This is accomplished by sending a WREN  (06h)\ninstruction to the AT25512. First, the CS pin is driven low to select the device and then a WREN  instruction is clocked\nin on the SI pin. Then the CS pin can be driven high and the WEL bit will be updated in the STATUS register to a logic\n‘1’. The device will power ‑up in the Write Disable state (WEL = 0).

The WRDI  instruction is independent of the status of the WP\npin.\nFigure 6-3.\u2000WRDI Timing\nSOSCKCS\nHigh-ImpedanceSI\nMSbWRDI Opcode (04h)\n0  0  0  0   0   1   0    00  1   2   3    4    5     6      7\n6.4 Write STATUS Register ( WRSR )\nThe Write STATUS Register ( WRSR ) instruction enables the SPI Host to change selected bits of the STATUS register.\nBefore a WRSR  instruction can be initiated, a WREN  instruction must be executed to set the WEL bit to logic ‘ 1’. Upon\ncompletion of a WREN  instruction, a WRSR  instruction can be executed.\nNote:\u2000  The WRSR  instruction has no effect on bit 6, bit 5, bit 4, bit 1 and bit 0 of the STATUS register. Only bit 7, bit\n3 and bit 2 can be changed via the WRSR  instruction. These modifiable bits are the Write-Protect Enable (WPEN) and\nBlock Protect (BP1, BP0) bits. These three bits are nonvolatile bits that have the same properties and functions as\nregular EEPROM cells. Their values are retained while power is removed from the device.\nThe AT25512 will not respond to commands other than a RDSR  after a WRSR  instruction until the self ‑timed internal\nwrite cycle has completed. When the write cycle is completed, the WEL bit in the STATUS register is reset to logic ‘ 0’. AT25512\nDevice Commands and Addressing\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.

This instruction initiates a self-timed internal write cycle (t WC) on the rising edge of CS after a valid sequence.\n6.4.1 Block Write-Protect Function\nThe WRSR  instruction allows the user to select one of four possible combinations as to how the memory array will be\ninhibited from writing through changing the Block Write-Protect bits (BP1, BP0). The four levels of array protection\nare:\n• None of the memory array is protected.\n• Upper quarter (¼) address range is write-protected meaning the highest order address bits are read ‑only.\n• Upper half (½) address range is write-protected meaning the highest order address bits are read ‑only.\n• All of the memory array is write-protected meaning all address bits are read ‑only.\nThe Block Write Protection levels and corresponding STATUS register control bits are shown in Table 6-4 .\nTable 6-4.\u2000Block Write-Protect Bits\nLevel STATUS Register Bits Write-Protected/Read ‑Only Address Range\nBP1 BP0 AT25512\n0 0 0 None\n1(1/4) 0 1 C000h-FFFFh\n2(1/2) 1 0 8000h-FFFFh\n3(All) 1 1 0000h-FFFFh\n6.4.2 Write-Protect Enable Function\nThe WRSR  instruction also allows the user to enable or disable the Write-Protect ( WP) pin through the use of the\nWrite-Protect Enable (WPEN) bit. When the WPEN bit is set to logic ‘ 0’, the ability to write the EEPROM array\nis dictated by the values of the Block Write-Protect (BP1, BP0) bits. The ability to write the STATUS register is\ncontrolled by the WEL bit. When the WPEN bit is set to logic ‘ 1’, the STATUS register is read-only.\nHardware Write Protection is enabled when both the WP pin is low and the WPEN bit has been set to a logic ‘ 1’.\nWhen the device is Hardware Write ‑Protected, writes to the STATUS register, including the Block Write ‑Protect, WEL\nand WPEN bits and to the sections in the memory array selected by the Block Write ‑Protect bits are disabled. When\nHardware Write Protection is enabled, writes are only allowed to sections of the memory that are not block ‑protected. AT25512\nDevice Commands and Addressing\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006218B-page 21\nHardware Write Protection is disabled when either the WP pin is high or the WPEN bit is a logic ‘ 0’. When Hardware\nWrite Protection is disabled, writes are only allowed to sections of the memory that are not block ‑protected. Refer to\nTable 6-5  for additional information.\nNote:\u2000  When the WPEN bit is Hardware Write ‑Protected, it cannot be set back to a logic ‘ 0’ as long as the WP pin is\nheld low.\nTable 6-5.\u2000WPEN Operation\nWPEN WP Pin WEL Protected Blocks Unprotected Blocks STATUS Register\n0 x 0 Protected Protected Protected\n0 x 1 Protected Writable Writable\n1 Low 0 Protected Protected Protected\n1 Low 1 Protected Writable Protected\nx High 0 Protected Protected Protected\nx High 1 Protected Writable Writable AT25512\nDevice Commands and Addressing\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006218B-page 22\n7. Read Sequence\nReading the AT25512 via the SO pin requires the following sequence. After the CS line is pulled low to select a\ndevice, the READ  (03h) instruction is transmitted via the SI line followed by the 16 ‑bit address to be read. Refer to\nTable 7-1  for the address bits for AT25512.\nTable 7-1.\u2000AT25512 Address Bits\nAddress AT25512\nAN A15—A 0\nUpon completion of the 16 ‑bit address, any data on the SI line will be ignored. The data (D7 ‑D0) at the specified\naddress is then shifted out onto the SO line. If only one byte is to be read, the CS line should be driven high after the\ndata comes out. The read sequence can be continued since the byte address is automatically incremented and data\nwill continue to be shifted out. When the highest ‑order address bit is reached, the address counter will rollover to the\nlowest ‑order address bit allowing the entire memory to be read in one continuous read cycle regardless of the starting\naddress.\nFigure 7-1.\u2000Read Waveform\nSOSISCK\nMSb MSb23 10\n0000001167 54 1011 98 12 2728 23 262524 2122 1920 2930   31\nREAD Opcode (03h)\nAAAA AAA AA\nMSb MSbDDDDDDDD DDAddress Bits A15-A0\nData Byte 1\nHigh-ImpedanceCS AT25512\nRead Sequence\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006218B-page 23\n8. Write Sequence\nIn order to program the AT25512, two separate instructions must be executed. First, the device must be write\nenabled  via the Write Enable ( WREN ) instruction. Then, one of the two possible write sequences described in this\nsection may be executed.\nNote:\u2000  If the device is not Write Enabled ( WREN ), the device will ignore the WRITE  instruction and will return to the\nstandby state when CS is brought high. A new CS assertion is required to re ‑initiate communication.\nThe address of the memory location(s) to be programmed must be outside the protected address field location\nselected by the block write protection level. During an internal write cycle, all commands will be ignored except the\nRDSR  instruction. Refer to Table 8-1  for the address bits for AT25512.\nTable 8-1.\u2000AT25512 Address Bits\nAddress AT25512\nAN A15—A 0\n8.1 Byte Write\nA byte write requires the following sequence and is depicted in Figure 8-1 . After the CS line is pulled low to select the\ndevice, the WRITE  (02h) instruction is transmitted via the SI line followed by the 16 ‑bit address and the data (D7 ‑D0)\nto be programmed. Programming will start after the CS pin is brought high. The low ‑to ‑high transition of the CS pin\nmust occur during the SCK low time (Mode 0) and SCK high time (Mode 3) immediately after clocking in the D0\n(LSB) data bit. The AT25512 is automatically returned to the Write Disable state (STATUS register bit WEL = 0) at the\ncompletion of a write cycle.\nFigure 8-1.\u2000Byte Write\nSOSISCKCS\nMSbA A A A A A \nMSb2 3 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 06 7 5 4 10 11 9 8 12 31 29 30 25 28 27 26 23 24 21 22\nWRITE Opcode (02h)\nHigh-ImpedanceA A A D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 \nMSbAddress Bits A15-A0 Data IntWC(1)\nNote:\u2000\n1. This instruction initiates a self-timed internal write cycle (t WC) on the rising edge of CS after a valid sequence.\n8.2 Page Write\nA page write sequence allows up to 128 bytes to be written in the same write cycle, provided that all bytes are in\nthe same row of the memory array. Partial page writes of less than 128 bytes are allowed. After each byte of data\nis received, the seven lowest order address bits are internally incremented following the receipt of each data byte.\nThe higher order address bits are not incremented and retain the memory array page location. If more bytes of data\nare transmitted that what will fit to the end of that memory row, the address counter will rollover to the beginning of\nthe same row. Nevertheless, creating a rollover event should be avoided as previously loaded data in the page could\nbecome unintentionally altered. The AT25512 is automatically returned to the Write Disable state (WEL = 0) at the\ncompletion of a write cycle. AT25512\nWrite Sequence\n© 2019-2021 Microchip Technology Inc.

This method allows the application to know immediately when the write cycle has\ncompleted to start a subsequent operation.\nOnce the internally-timed write cycle has started, a polling routine can be initiated. This involves repeatedly sending a\nRead STATUS Register ( RDSR ) instruction to determine if the device has completed its self-timed internal write cycle.\nIf the RDY/BSY bit (bit 0 of STATUS register) = 1, the write cycle is still in progress. If bit 0 = 0, the write cycle has\nended. If the RDY/BSY bit = 1, repeated RDSR  commands can be executed until the RDY/BSY bit = 0, signaling\nthat the device is ready to execute a new instruction. Only the Read STATUS Register ( RDSR ) instruction is enabled\nduring the write cycle.\nFigure 8-3.\u2000Polling Flowchart\nSend Valid \nWrite \nProtocolDeassert\nCS to VCC to \nInitiate a\nWrite CycleSend RDSR\nInstruction\nto the DeviceContinue to \nNext Operation\nNOYESDoes\nRDY/BSY\n= 0?
