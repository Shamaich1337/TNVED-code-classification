### Component Summary: MC74AC273DWG

**Description:**
The MC74AC273 is an octal D flip-flop designed by ON Semiconductor. It features eight edge-triggered D-type flip-flops with individual D inputs and Q outputs. The device includes a common buffered clock (CP) and a master reset (MR) input, allowing simultaneous loading and resetting of all flip-flops. This component is particularly useful in applications where a true output is required, and it is compatible with MOS microprocessors and memory.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - DC Supply Voltage (VCC): -0.5 to +7.0 V
  - DC Input Voltage (VIN): -0.5 to VCC + 0.5 V
