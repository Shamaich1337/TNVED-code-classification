The input range of the ADC can be optimized with the PGA front end.\nThe L TC2207/L TC2206 are perfect for demanding com-\nmunications applications, with AC performance that includes 78.2dB Noise Floor and 100dB spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). Ultralow jitter of 80fs\nRMS allows \nundersampling of high input frequencies with excellent noise performance. Maximum DC specs include ±4LSB \nINL, ±1LSB DNL (no missing codes) over temperature. \nA separate output power supply allows the CMOS output \nswing to range from 0.5V to 3.6V . \nThe ENC\n+ and ENC– inputs may be driven differentially \nor single-ended with a sine wave, PECL, LVDS, TTL or CMOS inputs. An optional clock duty cycle stabilizer al-lows high performance at full speed with a wide range of clock duty cycles.\n■ Telecommunications\n■ Receivers\n■ Cellular Base Stations\n■ Spectrum Analysis\n■ Imaging Systems\n■ ATE■ Sample Rate: 105Msps/80Msps\n■ 78.2dBFS Noise Floor\n■ 100dB SFDR\n■ SFDR >82dB at 250MHz (1.5V P-P Input Range)\n■ PGA Front End (2.25V P-P or 1.5V P-P Input Range)\n■ 700MHz Full Power Bandwidth S/H\n■ Optional Internal Dither\n■ Optional Data Output Randomizer\n■ Single 3.3V Supply\n■ Power Dissipation: 900mW/725mW\n■ Optional Clock Duty Cycle Stabilizer\n■ Out-of-Range Indicator\n■ Pin-Compatible Family\n  105Msps: L TC2207 (16-Bit), L TC2207-14 (14-Bit)  80Msps: L TC2206 (16-Bit), L TC2206-14 (14-Bit)  65Msps: L TC2205 (16-Bit), L TC2205-14 (14-Bit)  40Msps: L TC2204 (16-Bit)  25Msps: L TC2203 (16-Bit) Single-Ended Clock  10Msps: L TC2202 (16-Bit) Single-Ended Clock\n■ 48-Pin 7mm × 7mm QFN Package\n–+\nS/H\nAMPCORRECTION\nLOGIC AND\nSHIFT REGISTEROUTPUT\nDRIVERS16-BIT\nPIPELINED\nADC COREINTERNAL ADC\nREFERENCE\nGENERATOR1.25V\nCOMMON MODE\nBIAS VOLTAGE\nCLOCK/DUTY\nCYCLE\nCONTROLD15\n•\n•\n•\nD0\nENC + PGA SHDN DITH MODE OE RAND ENC–VCM\nANALOG\nINPUT\n22076 TA01 0.5V TO 3.6V\n3.3V3.3V\nSENSE\nOGNDOVDD\n2.2μF0.1μF\n0.1μF 0.1μF 0.1μFVDD\nGND\nADC CONTROL INPUTSAIN+\nAIN–OF\nCLKOUT+\nCLKOUT–\nFREQUENCY (MHz)0AMPLITUDE (dBFS)–70–300\n40\n22076 G05–90\n–110–80–50–10\n–20\n–40\n–60\n–100\n–120\n–130\n10 20 30 50L TC2207: 64K Point FFT ,\nfIN = 14.8MHz, –1dBFS,\nPGA = 0, 105Msps TYPICAL APPLICATION DESCRIPTION  FEATURES\n APPLICATIONSL, LT, LTC, LTM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks of Linear \nTechnology Corporation.

Functional Block DiagramBLOCK DIAGRAM\nLTC2207/LTC2206\n1622076fcDYNAMIC PERFORMANCE\nSignal-to-Noise Plus Distortion Ratio\nThe signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio [S/(N+D)] is the \nratio between the RMS amplitude of the fundamental input frequency and the RMS amplitude of all other frequency components at the ADC output. The output is band lim-ited to frequencies above DC to below half the sampling frequency. \nSignal-to-Noise Ratio\nThe signal-to-noise (SNR) is the ratio between the RMS \namplitude of the fundamental input frequency and the RMS amplitude of all other frequency components, except the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve harmonics. \nTotal Harmonic Distortion\nTotal harmonic distortion is the ratio of the RMS sum \nof all harmonics of the input signal to the fundamental itself. The out-of-band harmonics alias into the frequency band between DC and half the sampling frequency. THD is expressed as:\n THD = –20Log (\n√(V22 + V 32 + V 42 + ... V N2)/V1)\nwhere V 1 is the RMS amplitude of the fundamental fre-\nquency and V 2 through V N are the amplitudes of the second \nthrough nth harmonics. \nIntermodulation Distortion\nIf the ADC input signal consists of more than one spectral \ncomponent, the ADC transfer function nonlinearity can produce intermodulation distortion (IMD) in addition to THD.\n IMD is the change in one sinusoidal input caused \nby the presence of another sinusoidal input at a different frequency.If two pure sine waves of frequencies fa and fb are ap-plied to the ADC input, nonlinearities in the ADC transfer function can create distortion products at the sum and difference frequencies of mfa ± nfb, where m and n = \n0, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n For example, the 3rd order IMD terms \ninclude (2fa + fb), (fa + 2fb), (2fa - fb) and (fa - 2fb). The 3rd order IMD is deﬁ  ned as the ration of the RMS value \nof either input tone to the RMS value of the largest 3rd order IMD product.\nSpurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)\nThe ratio of the RMS input signal amplitude to the RMS \nvalue of the peak spurious spectral component expressed in dBc. SFDR may also be calculated relative to full scale and expressed in dBFS.\nFull Power Bandwidth\nThe full power bandwidth is that input frequency at which \nthe amplitude of the reconstructed fundamental is reduced by 3dB for a full-scale input signal. \nAperture Delay Time\nThe time from when a rising ENC\n+ equals the ENC– voltage \nto the instant that the input signal is held by the sample- and-hold circuit. \nAperture Delay Jitter\nThe variation in the aperture delay time from conversion \nto conversion. This random variation will result in noise when sampling an AC input. The signal to noise ratio due to the jitter alone will be: \n SNR\nJITTER = –20log (2 π • fIN • tJITTER )OPERATION\nLTC2207/LTC2206\n1722076fcCONVERTER OPERATION\nThe L TC2207/L TC2206 are CMOS pipelined multistep con-\nverters with a front-end PGA. As shown in Figure 1, the con-\nverter has ﬁ  ve pipelined ADC stages; a sampled analog input \nwill result in a digitized value seven cycles clock later (see the Timing Diagram section). The analog input is differential for improved common mode noise immunity and to maximize the input range. Additionally, the differential input drive will reduce even order harmonics of the sample and hold circuit. The encode input is also differential for improved common mode noise immunity. \nThe L TC2207/L TC2206 have two phases of operation, \ndetermined by the state of the differential ENC\n+/ENC– \ninput pins. For brevity, the text will refer to ENC+ great-\ner than ENC– as ENC high and ENC+ less than ENC– as \nENC low.\nEach pipelined stage shown in Figure 1 contains an ADC, \na reconstruction DAC and an interstage ampliﬁ  er . In \noperation, the ADC quantizes the input to the stage and the quantized value is subtracted from the input by the DAC to produce a residue. The residue is ampliﬁ  ed and \noutput by the residue ampliﬁ  er . Successive stages oper-\nate out-of-phase so that when odd stages are outputting their residue, the even stages are acquiring that residue \nand vice versa.\nWhen ENC is low, the analog input is sampled differen-\ntially directly onto the input sample-and-hold capacitors, inside the “input S/H” shown in the Block Diagram. At the instant that ENC transitions from low to high, the voltage on the sample capacitors is held. While ENC is high, the held input voltage is buffered by the S/H ampliﬁ  er which \ndrives the ﬁ  rst pipelined ADC stage. The ﬁ  rst stage acquires \nthe output of the S/H ampliﬁ  er during the high phase of \nENC. When ENC goes back low, the ﬁ  rst stage produces its residue which is acquired by the second stage. At the same time, the input S/H goes back to acquiring the analog input. When ENC goes high, the second stage produces its residue which is acquired by the third stage. An iden-tical process is repeated for the third and fourth stages, resulting in a fourth stage residue that is sent to the ﬁ  fth \nstage for ﬁ  nal evaluation.\nEach ADC stage following the ﬁ  rst has additional range to \naccommodate ﬂ  ash and ampliﬁ  er offset errors. Results \nfrom all of the ADC stages are digitally delayed such that the results can be properly combined in the correction logic before being sent to the output buffer .APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC2207/LTC2206\n1822076fcSAMPLE/HOLD OPERATION AND INPUT DRIVE\nSample/Hold Operation\nFigure 2 shows an equivalent circuit for the L TC2207/\nL TC2206 CMOS differential sample and hold. The differ-ential analog inputs are sampled directly onto sampling capacitors (C\nSAMPLE ) through NMOS transistors. The \ncapacitors shown attached to each input (C PARASITIC ) are \nthe summation of all other capacitance associated with each input. \nDuring the sample phase when ENC is low, the NMOS \ntransistors connect the analog inputs to the sampling capacitors and they charge to, and track the differential input voltage. When ENC transitions from low to high, the sampled input voltage is held on the sampling capacitors. During the hold phase when ENC is high, the sampling capacitors are disconnected from the input and the held voltage is passed to the ADC core for processing. As ENC transitions for high to low, the inputs are reconnected to the sampling capacitors to acquire a new sample. Since the sampling capacitors still hold the previous sample, a charging glitch proportional to the change in voltage between samples will be seen at this time. If the change between the last sample and the new sample is small, the charging glitch seen at the input will be small. If the input change is large, such as the change seen with input frequencies near Nyquist, then a larger charging glitch will be seen.\nCommon Mode Bias\nThe ADC sample-and-hold circuit requires differential \ndrive to achieve speciﬁ  ed performance. Each input should \nswing ±0.5625V for the 2.25V range (PGA = 0) or ±0.375V \nfor the 1.5V range (PGA = 1), around a common mode voltage of 1.25V . The V\nCM output pin (Pin 2) is designed \nto provide the common mode bias level. V CM can be tied \ndirectly to the center tap of a transformer to set the DC input level or as a reference level to an op amp differential driver circuit. The V\nCM pin must be bypassed to ground \nclose to the ADC with 2.2μF or greater .Input Drive Impedence\nAs with all high performance, high speed ADCs the \ndynamic performance of the L TC2207/L TC2206 can be inﬂ  uenced by the input drive circuitry, particularly the second and third harmonics. Source impedance and in-put reactance can inﬂ  uence SFDR. At the falling edge of \nENC the sample-and-hold circuit will connect the 4.9pF sampling capacitor to the input pin and start the sampling period. The sampling period ends when ENC rises, hold-\ning the sampled input on the sampling capacitor . Ideally, the input circuitry should be fast enough to fully charge the sampling capacitor during the sampling period 1/(2F\nENCODE ); however , this is not always possible and the \nincomplete settling may degrade the SFDR. The sampling glitch has been designed to be as linear as possible to minimize the effects of incomplete settling.\nFor the best performance it is recommended to have a \nsource impedence of 100 Ω or less for each input. The \nsource impedence should be matched for the differential inputs. Poor matching will result in higher even order harmonics, especially the second.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 2.

The L TC2207/L TC2206 have a very broadband S/H circuit, DC to 700MHz; it can be used in a wide range of applications; therefore, it is not possible to provide a single recom-mended RC ﬁ  lter . \nFigures 3, 4a and 4b show three examples of input RC \nﬁ  ltering at three ranges of input frequencies. In general it is desirable to make the capacitors as large as can be tolerated—this will help suppress random noise as well as noise coupled from the digital circuitry. The L TC2207/L TC2206 do not require any input ﬁ  lter to achieve data sheet \nspeciﬁ  cations; however , no ﬁ  ltering will put more stringent \nnoise requirements on the input drive circuitry.\nT ransformer Coupled Circuits\nFigure 3 shows the L TC2207/L TC2206 being driven by \nan RF transformer with a center-tapped secondary. The secondary center tap is DC biased with V\nCM, setting the \nADC input signal at its optimum DC level. Figure 3 shows a 1:1 turns ratio transformer . Other turns ratios can be used; however , as the turns ratio increases so does the impedance seen by the ADC.

This type of transformer has much better high frequency response and balance than ﬂ  ux coupled center tap transformers.

Reference CircuitDirect Coupled Circuits\nFigure 5 demonstrates the use of a differential ampliﬁ  er to \nconvert a single ended input signal into a differential input signal. The advantage of this method is that it provides low frequency input response; however , the limited gain bandwidth of any op amp or closed-loop ampliﬁ  er will de-\ngrade the ADC SFDR at high input frequencies. Additionally, wideband op amps or differential ampliﬁ  ers tend to have \nhigh noise. As a result, the SNR will be degraded unless the noise bandwidth is limited prior to the ADC input.\nReference Operation\nFigure 6 shows the L TC2207/L TC2206 reference circuitry \nconsisting of a 2.5V bandgap reference, a programmable gain ampliﬁ  er and control circuit. The L TC2207/L TC2206 \nhave three modes of reference operation: Internal Refer-ence, 1.25V external reference or 2.5V external reference. To use the internal reference, tie the SENSE pin to V\nDD. To \nuse an external reference, simply apply either a 1.25V or 2.5V reference voltage to the SENSE input pin. Both 1.25V and 2.5V applied to SENSE will result in a full-scale range of 2.25V\nP-P (PGA = 0). A 1.25V output V CM is provided \nfor a common mode bias for input drive circuitry. An external bypass capacitor is required for the V\nCM output. \nThis provides a high frequency low impedance path to ground for internal and external circuitry. This is also the compensation capacitor for the reference; it will not be \nstable without this capacitor . The minimum value required for stability is 2.2μF .\nThe internal programmable gain ampliﬁ  er provides the \ninternal reference voltage for the ADC. This ampliﬁ  er has \nvery stringent settling requirements and is not accessible for external use.\nThe SENSE pin can be driven ±5% around the nominal 2.5V \nor 1.25V external reference inputs. This adjustment range can be used to trim the ADC gain error or other system gain errors. When selecting the internal reference, the SENSE pin should be tied to V\nDD as close to the converter \nas possible. If the sense pin is driven externally it should be bypassed to ground as close to the device as possible with 1μF (or larger) ceramic capacitor .\nPGA Pin \nThe PGA pin selects between two gain settings for the \nADC front-end. PGA = 0 selects an input range of 2.25V\nP-\nP; PGA = 1 selects an input range of 1.5V P-P. The 2.25V \ninput range has the best SNR; however , the distortion will be higher for input frequencies above 100MHz. For ap-plications with high input frequencies, the low input range will have improved distortion; however , the SNR will be 2.4dB worse. See the Typical Performance Characteristics section of this datasheet.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC2207/LTC2206\n2122076fc22076 F10ENC–ENC+3.3V\n3.3V\nD0\nQ0Q0MC100LVELT22\nL TC2207/\nL TC2206\nFigure 10.

For the ADC to operate properly the encode signal should have a 50% (±5%) duty cycle. Each half cycle must be at least 4.52ns for the L TC2207 internal circuitry to have enough settling time for proper operation. For the L TC2206, each half cycle must be at least 5.94ns. Achieving a precise 50% duty cycle is easy with differential sinusoidal drive using a transformer or using symmetric differential logic such as PECL or LVDS. When using a single-ended ENCODE signal asymmetric rise and fall times can result in duty cycles that are far from 50%.\nAn optional clock duty cycle stabilizer can be used if the \ninput clock does not have a 50% duty cycle. This circuit uses the rising edge of ENC pin to sample the analog input. The falling edge of ENC is ignored and an internal falling edge is generated by a phase-locked loop. The input clock duty cycle can vary from 30% to 70% and the clock duty cycle stabilizer will maintain a constant 50% internal duty cycle. If the clock is turned off for a long period of time, the duty cycle stabilizer circuit will require one hundred clock cycles for the PLL to lock onto the input clock. To use the clock duty cycle stabilizer , the MODE pin must be connected to 1/3V\nDD or 2/3V DD using external resistors.\nThe lower limit of the L TC2207/L TC2206 sample rate is \ndetermined by droop of the sample and hold circuits. The pipelined architecture of this ADC relies on storing analog signals on small valued capacitors. Junction leakage will discharge the capacitors. The speciﬁ  ed minimum operating \nfrequency for the L TC2207/L TC2206 is 1Msps.Driving the Encode Inputs\nThe noise performance of the L TC2207/L TC2206 can \ndepend on the encode signal quality as much as for the analog input. The encode inputs are intended to be driven differentially, primarily for noise immunity from common mode noise sources. Each input is biased through a 6k resistor to a 1.6V bias. The bias resistors set the DC oper-ating point for transformer coupled drive circuits and can set the logic threshold for single-ended drive circuits.\nAny noise present on the encode signal will result in ad-\nditional aperture jitter that will be RMS summed with the inherent ADC aperture jitter . \nIn applications where jitter is critical (high input frequen-\ncies), take the following into consideration:\n1. Differential drive should be used. 2. Use as large an amplitude possible. If using trans-\nformer coupling, use a higher turns ratio to increase the amplitude. \n3. If the ADC is clocked with a ﬁ  xed frequency sinusoidal \nsignal, ﬁ  lter the encode signal to reduce wideband \nnoise.\n4. Balance the capacitance and series resistance at both  \nencode inputs such that any coupled noise will appear at both inputs as common mode noise.\nThe encode inputs have a common mode range of 1.2V \nto V\nDD. Each input may be driven from ground to V DD for \nsingle-ended drive.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC2207/LTC2206\n2322076fcDIGITAL OUTPUTS\nDigital Output Buffers\nFigure 11 shows an equivalent circuit for a single output \nbuffer . Each buffer is powered by OV DD and OGND, isolated \nfrom the ADC power and ground. The additional N-channel transistor in the output driver allows operation down to low voltages. The internal resistor in series with the output eliminates the need for external damping resistors.\nAs with all high speed/high resolution converters, the digi-\ntal output loading can affect the performance. The digital outputs of the L TC2207/L TC2206 should drive a minimum capacitive load to avoid possible interaction between the digital outputs and sensitive input circuitry. The output should be buffered with a device such as a ALVCH16373 CMOS latch. For full speed operation the capacitive load should be kept under 10pF . A resistor in series with the output may be used but is not required since the output buffer has a series resistor of 33 Ω on chip.\nLower OV\nDD voltages will also help reduce interference \nfrom the digital outputs. \nData Format \nThe L TC2207/L TC2206 parallel digital output can be \nselected for offset binary or 2’s complement format. The format is selected with the MODE pin. This pin has a four level logic input, centered at 0, 1/3V\nDD, 2/3V DD and V DD. \nAn external resistor divider can be user to set the 1/3V DD \nand 2/3V DD logic levels.

Both a noninverted version, CLKOUT+ and an inverted version CLKOUT– are provided. TheCLKOUT+/CLKOUT– can be used to synchronize the con-verter data to the digital system. This is necessary when using a sinusoidal encode. Data can be latched on the rising edge of CLKOUT+ or the falling edge of CLKOUT–. CLKOUT+ falls and CLKOUT– rises as the data outputs are updated. \nFigure 12.

Interference from the digital outputs may be from capacitive or inductive coupling or coupling through the ground plane. Even a tiny coupling factor can result in discernible unwanted tones in the ADC output spectrum. By randomizing the digital output before it is transmitted off chip, these unwanted tones can be randomized, trading a slight increase in the noise ﬂ  oor for a large reduction in \nunwanted tone amplitude.\nThe digital output is “Randomized” by applying an exclu-\nsive-OR logic operation between the LSB and all other data output bits. To decode, the reverse operation is applied; that is, an exclusive-OR operation is applied between the LSB and all other bits. The LSB, OF and CLKOUT outputs are not affected. The output Randomizer function is active when the RAND pin is high.\nOutput Driver Power\nSeparate output power and ground pins allow the output \ndrivers to be isolated from the analog circuitry. The power supply for the digital output buffers, OV\nDD, should be tied \nto the same power supply as for the logic being driven. For example, if the converter is driving a DSP powered by a 1.8V supply, then OV\nDD should be tied to that same 1.8V supply. In CMOS mode OV DD can be powered with \nany logic voltage up to the V DD of the ADC. OGND can be \npowered with any voltage from ground up to 1V and must be less than OV\nDD. The logic outputs will swing between \nOGND and OV DD.\nInternal Dither\nThe L TC2207/L TC2206 are 16-bit ADCs with a very linear \ntransfer function; however , at low input levels even slight imperfections in the transfer function will result in unwanted tones. Small errors in the transfer function are usually a result of ADC element mismatches. An optional internal dither mode can be enabled to randomize the input location on the ADC transfer curve, resulting in improved SFDR for low signal levels.\nAs shown in Figure 15, the output of the sample-and-hold \nampliﬁ  er is summed with the output of a dither DAC. The dither DAC is driven by a long sequence pseudo-random number generator; the random number fed to the dither \nDAC is also subtracted from the ADC result. If the dither DAC is precisely calibrated to the ADC, very little of the dither signal will be seen at the output. The dither signal that does leak through will appear as white noise.

The pinout of the L TC2207/L TC2206 has been optimized for a ﬂ  owthrough \nlayout so that the interaction between inputs and digital outputs is minimized. Layout for the printed circuit board should ensure that digital and analog signal lines are separated as much as possible. In particular , care should be taken not to run any digital track alongside an analog signal track or underneath the ADC. \nHigh quality ceramic bypass capacitors should be used \nat the V\nDD, VCM, and OV DD pins. Bypass capacitors must \nbe located as close to the pins as possible. The traces connecting the pins and bypass capacitors must be kept \nshort and should be made as wide as possible.\nThe L TC2207/L TC2206 differential inputs should run \nparallel and close to each other . The input traces should be as short as possible to minimize capacitance and to minimize noise pickup.\nHeat T ransfer\nMost of the heat generated by the L TC2207/L TC2206 is \ntransferred from the die through the bottom-side exposed pad. For good electrical and thermal performance, the exposed pad must be soldered to a large grounded pad on the PC board. It is critical that the exposed pad and all ground pins are connected to a ground plane of sufﬁ  cient \narea with as many vias as possible.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC2207/LTC2206\n2722076fcTop Side Silkscreen TopAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n\nLTC2207/LTC2206\n2822076fcInner Layer 3 Inner Layer 2APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInner Layer 5 Inner Layer 4\nLTC2207/LTC2206\n2922076fcBottom Side Silkscreen BottomAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n\nLTC2207/LTC2206\n3022076fc\nOrdering Guide:\nDEMO BOARD NUMBER PART NUMBER RESOLUTION SPEED INPUT FREQUENCY USB I/F BOARD\nDC918C-A L TC2207CUK 16-Bit 105Msps 1MHz to 70MHz DC718DC918C-B L TC2207CUK 16-Bit 105Msps 70MHz to 140MHz DC718DC918C-C L TC2206CUK 16-Bit 80Msps 1MHz to 70MHz DC718DC918C-D L TC2206CUK 16-Bit 80Msps 70MHz to 140MHz DC718DC918C-E L TC2205CUK 16-Bit 65Msps 1MHz to 70MHz DC718DC918C-F L TC2205CUK 16-Bit 65Msps 70MHz to 140MHz DC718DC918C-G L TC2204CUK 16-Bit 40Msps 1MHz to 70MHz DC718DC918C-H L TC2207CUK-14 14-Bit 105Msps 1MHz to 70MHz DC718DC918C-I L TC2207CUK-14 14-Bit 105Msps 70MHz to 140MHz DC718DC918C-J L TC2206CUK-14 14-Bit 80Msps 1MHz to 70MHz DC718DC918C-K L TC2206CUK-14 14-Bit 80Msps 70MHz to 140MHz DC718DC918C-L L TC2205CUK-14 14-Bit 65Msps 1MHz to 70MHz DC718\nSee Web site for ordering details or contact local sales.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC2207/LTC2206\n3122076fc\nInformation furnished by Linear Technology Corporation is believed to be accurate and reliable.
