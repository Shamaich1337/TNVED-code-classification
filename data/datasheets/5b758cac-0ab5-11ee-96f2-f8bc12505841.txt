Caution: \n9.1 Operating voltage \nWhen DC-rated capacitors are to be used in AC or ri pple current circuits, be sure to maintain the Vp-p  value of the applied voltage or the Vo-p \nwhich contains DC bias within the rated voltage ran ge. \nWhen the voltage is started to apply to the circuit  or it is stopped applying, the irregular voltage m ay be generated for a transit period because of \nresonance or switching. Be sure to use a capacitor within rated voltage containing these irregular vol tage. \n \n9.2 Operating temperature and self-generated heat  \nKeep the surface temperature of a capacitor below t he upper limit of its rated operating temperature r ange. Be sure to take into account the heat \ngenerated by the capacitor itself. \n9.3 Test condition for withstanding voltage \n(1) Test equipment \nTest equipment for AC withstanding voltage should b e used with the performance of the wave similar to 50/60 Hz sine wave. \nIf the distorted sine wave or over load exceeding t he specified voltage value is applied, the defectiv e may be caused. \n(2) Voltage applied method \nWhen the withstanding voltage is applied, capacitor ’s lead or terminal should be firmly connected to t he out-put of the withstanding voltage test \nequipment, and then the voltage should be raised fr om near zero to the test voltage. \nIf the test voltage without the raise from near zer o voltage would be applied directly to capacitor, t est voltage should be applied with the *zero cross.  \nAt the end of the test time, the test voltage shoul d be reduced to near zero, and then capacitor’s lea d or terminal should be taken off the out-put of th e \nwithstanding voltage test equipment. \nIf the test voltage without the raise from near zer o voltage would be applied directly \nto capacitor, the surge voltage may arise, and ther efore, the defective may be caused. \n*ZERO CROSS is the point where voltage sine wave pa ss 0V. \n- See the right figure – \n9.4 Fail-Safe \nWhen capacitor would be broken, failure may result in a short circuit. Be sure to provide an appropria te fail-safe function like a fuse on your \nproduct if failure would follow an electric shock, fire or fume. \n9.5 Vibration and impact \nDo not expose a capacitor or its leads to excessive  shock or vibration during use. \n\n \nSAFETY STANDARDS REGULATED, REINFORCED \nINSULATION TYPE, AH SERIES （（ （（Small Size ）） ））  POE-D24-01-E-06  Ver: 06  Page: 16 / 19  \n \n 9.6 Soldering \nWhen soldering this product to a PCB/PWB, do not ex ceed the solder heat resistance specification ofthe  capacitor. Subjecting this product to \nexcessive heating could melt the internal junction solder and may result in thermal shocks that can cr ack the ceramic element. \nWhen soldering capacitor with a soldering iron, it should be performed in following conditions. \nTemperature of iron-tip : 400 ℃ max. \nSoldering iron wattage : 50W max. \nSoldering time : 3.5s max. \n9.7 Bonding, resin molding and coating \nIn case of bonding, molding or coating this product , verify that these processes do not affect the qua lity of capacitor by testing the performance of \nthe bonded, molded or coated product in the intende d equipment. \nIn case of the amount of applications, dryness / ha rdening conditions of adhesives and molding resins containing organic solvents (ethyl acetate, \nmethyl ethyl ketone, toluene, etc.) are unsuitable,  the outer coating resin of a capacitor is damaged by the organic solvents and it may result, worst ca se, \nin a short circuit. \nThe variation in thickness of adhesive, molding res in or coating may cause a outer coating resin crack ing and/or ceramic element cracking of a \ncapacitor in a temperature cycling. \n9.8 Treatment after bonding, resin molding and coat ing  \nWhen the outer coating is hot (over 100 ℃) after soldering, it becomes soft and fragile. \nSo please be careful not to give it mechanical stre ss. \nFailure to follow the above cautions may result, wo rst case, in a short circuit and cause fuming or pa rtial dispersion when the product is used. \n9.9 Operating and storage environment \nThe insulating coating of capacitors does not form a perfect seal; therefore, do not use or store capa citors in a corrosive atmosphere, especially \nwhere chloride gas, sulfide gas, acid, alkali, salt  or the like are present. And avoid exposure to moi sture. Before cleaning, bonding, or molding this \nproduct, verify that these processes do not affect product quality by testing the performance of a cle aned, bonded or molded product in the intended \nequipment. Store the capacitors where the temperatu re and relative humidity do not exceed -10 to 40 ℃and 15 to 85%. \nUse capacitors within 6 months after delivered. Che ck the solderability after 6 months or more. \n9.10 Limitation of applications \nPlease contact us before using our products for the  applications listed below which require especially  high reliability for the prevention of defects \nwhich might directly cause damage to the third part y’s life, body or property. \n1.

Notices: \n10.1 Cleaning (ultrasonic cleaning): \nTo perform ultrasonic cleaning, observe the followi ng conditions. \nRinse bath capacity : Output of 20 watts per liter or less. \nRinsing time : 5 min maximum. \nDo not vibrate the PCB/PWB directly. \nExcessive ultrasonic cleaning may lead to fatigue d estruction of the lead wires. \n10.2 Capacitance change of capacitors \n\uf0d7 Class 1 capacitors \nCapacitance might change a little depending on a su rrounding temperature or an applied voltage. \nPlease contact us if you use for the strict time co nstant circuit. \n\uf0d7 Class 2 and 3 capacitors \nClass 2 and 3 capacitors like temperature character istic B, E and F have an aging characteristic, wher eby the capacitor continually decreases its \ncapacitance slightly if the capacitor leaves for a long time. Moreover, capacitance might change great ly depending on a surrounding temperature or an \napplied voltage. So, it is not likely to be able to  use for the time constant circuit. \nPlease contact us if you need a detail information.  \n10.3 Performance check by equipment  \nBefore using a capacitor, check that there is no pr oblem in the equipment\'s performance and the specif ications. \nGenerally speaking, CLASS 2 ceramic capacitors have  voltage dependence characteristics and temperature  dependence characteristics in capacitance. \nSo, the capacitance value may change depending on t he operating condition in a equipment. Therefore, b e sure to confirm the apparatus performance of \nreceiving influence in a capacitance value change o f a capacitor, such as leakage current and noise su ppression characteristic. \nMoreover, check the surge-proof ability of a capaci tor in the equipment, if needed, because the surge voltage may exceed specific value by the \ninductance of the circuit. \n11.
