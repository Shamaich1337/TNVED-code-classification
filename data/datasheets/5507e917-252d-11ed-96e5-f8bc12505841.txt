When  VCC  gradually  decreases  to  the  under-voltage  protection  trigger  \nvoltage  VCCUV ,  the  under-voltage  protection  will  be  triggered.  The  six  secondary  side  \ndrive  circuits  will  be  locked  in  the  off  state  to  keep  the  IGBT  off;  the  output  protection  signal  \nSO  (as  shown  in  Figure  2).  When  VCC  recovers  to  the  under-voltage  recovery  value  \nVCCUVR,  the  driver  will  continue  to  maintain  the  protection  state  for  a  locked  time  \ntB,  and  then  release  the  driver  circuit  to  turn  off  the  locked  state  and  restore  the  protection  \nsignal  SO.Other  channels  will  not  be  affected  and  can  still  be  switched  normally,  and  the  corresponding  \nSO  signal  is  in  normal  state.  When  the  fault  condition  is  removed  and  the  VCCO  is  restored,  \nthe  driver  will  first  restore  the  positive  pressure,  and  then  restore  the  negative  \npressure.  The  protection  blocking  status  and  SO  signal  will  wait  for  a  blocking  time  tB  before  \nreturning  to  normal.\nThe  transmission  \nlogic  trigger  signal  is  input  from  the  INx  port,  the  input  IN1  corresponds  to  1  \nchannel,  and  the  input  IN2  corresponds  to  2  channels;  transmission  logic  (see  Figure  4).

The  short-circuit  protection  \nfunction  is  only  valid  when  the  IGBT  is  turned  on;  when  the  IGBT  is  turned  off,  the  trigger  \nsignal  will  turn  on  the  QCE ,  so  that  the  VCEDT  is  clamped  at  COMx,  which  is  much  lower  \nthan  the  protection  trigger  value  VREF  (9V),  and  the  comparator  does  not  operate.For  the  selection  of  gate  resistors  RGON  and  RGOFF ,  users  can  consult  our  \ntechnical  support  for  setting  and  factory  pre-configuration.  When  installing  on  the  \ncorresponding  IGBT  module,  please  make  sure  that  the  appropriate  gate  resistor  has  \nbeen  installed.RGOFF  discharges  the  gate  of  the  IGBT  to  turn  off  the  IGBT.RGON  charges  the  gate  of  the  IGBT  and  turns  the  IGBT  on.  External  push-pull  output  is  \nprovided  outside  the  driver  to  expand  the  drive  current  capability.The  fast  turn-off  \nof  the  IGBT  by  the  active  clamp  may  cause  voltage  spikes  that  increase  with  \nthe  bus  voltage  and  load  current.  Excessive  voltage  spikes  can  threaten  the  safety  of  the  \nIGBT.  The  turn-off  voltage  spike  is  mainly  related  to  the  system  stray  reactance  Ls  and  \nthe  IGBT  turn-off  current  change  rate  dI/dt.  By  adjusting  the  turn-off  gate  resistance  \nRGOFF ,  dI/dt  can  be  appropriately  reduced,  thereby  appropriately  reducing  the  peak  \nvoltage;  but  the  influence  of  Ls  is  unavoidable. ,  especially  under  high  current  conditions  \nsuch  as  short  circuit  and  overcurrent,  the  situation  is  particularly  bad.  Therefore,  the  driver  \nis  equipped  with  an  active  clamp  circuit  to  suppress  overvoltage  spikes,  which  can  \neffectively  prevent  overvoltage  damage  to  the  IGBT,  the  principle  of  an  active  clamp  \ncircuit  (see  Figure  7).\nFigure  7  Schematic  diagram  of  an  active  clamp  \ncircuit.  A  transient  suppression  diode  (TVS)  is  used  to  establish  a  feedback  \nchannel  between  the  collector  and  gate  of  the  IGBT.  When  the  VCE  peak  voltage  of  the  \nIGBT  exceeds  a  breakdown  threshold,  the  TVS  string  will  be  turned  on,  and  the  current  \nflowing  through  the  TVS  string  will  be  injected  into  the  gate  of  the  IGBT,  so  that  the  IGBT  \nremains  partially  turned  on,  thereby  suppressing  the  VCE  voltage  of  the  IGBT.  The  preset  \nbreakdown  thresholds  of  the  driver  are  shown  in  Table  1.  Table  1  Active  clamp  \nthreshold  table  (TA=25ÿ)Turn-on  and  turn-  off  of  IGBT  When  \nthe  IGBT  needs  to  be  turned  on,  the  QON  tube  in  the  driver\'s  internal  chip  is  \nturned  on,  and  the  QOFF  tube  is  turned  off.\nWhen  the  IGBT  needs  to  be  turned  off,  the  QOFF  tube  in  the  driver\'s  internal  \nchip  is  turned  on,  and  the  QON  tube  is  turned  off.  By  turning  off  the  gate  resistorProtection  signal  \noutput  The  protection  signal  output  terminal  SO  is  in  the  form  of  open-drain  \ninternally  (see  Figure  5).  Under  normal  circumstances,  QSO  is  turned  off,  and  the  SO  \noutput  terminal  is  high  level  (5V).  When  a  certain  channel  of  the  driver  is  protected,  the  \nfault  signal  of  the  corresponding  channel  is  transmitted  to  the  primary  side  through  the  \nchip.  At  this  time,  QSO  will  be  turned  on,  and  SO  will  become  low  level  (ground).  In  the  \ndefault  state,  R3=39ÿ,  R4=4.7kÿ,  and  the  overcurrent  capability  of  the  QSO  tube  is  10mA.  \nWhen  the  fault  is  removed,  the  QSO  can  be  turned  off  through  the  reset  signal  RST  and  \nreturned  to  normal.\n1kÿ CircuitSO\nLogicFault\nRST\nQOFFVREF  to  VE=9V\nQCERA Logic\nCAVCEDTRVCE\n+ProtectionVREF6AP0215T08- HPD  driver  \nwww.qtjtec.com\nRGON\nActive  ClampingQOFFQOFF  \nTurn  -off  Logic\nGLMachine Translated by Google\nVREF\nVCE-SATVCE-OFF\nVCE-SAT\n0V\nVREF0V\nVCEx\nVCEDT-9V\n0V\nShort-Circuit  typeVGx\n-9V-9V\nVCE\n0V0V\nVCE-SAT\nVCEDTVGx\n-9VINx\nINx\nSOxSOx\n03-Aug-2021  V1.3 Copyright:  ©  Shenzhen  Bronze  Sword  Technology  Co.,  Ltd.Class  II  short  circuit  protectionNormal  turn-on  behavior  When  the  \ndriver  performs  the  IGBT  turn-on  action,  the  trigger  signal  transmitted  to  the  secondary  side  will  turn  \noff  the  QCE  and  release  the  VCEDT  clamping  state.  At  this  time,  the  VCE  of  the  IGBT  is  still  at  a  high  level,  and  \nthe  CA  capacitor  will  be  charged  through  the  RVCE  resistor  string  and  the  RA  resistor ,  so  that  the  VCEDT  level  \nwill  gradually  rise.  Then  the  IGBT  is  turned  on,  VCE  drops  rapidly  to  VCE  SAT,  and  VCEDT  also  charges  to  \nVCE-SAT  (see  Figure  9).  During  normal  operation,  the  voltage  of  VCE-SAT  is  relatively  low,  and  the  maximum  \nvalue  is  about  2V.  Since  VCE-SAT  is  far  lower  than  the  protection  trigger  value  VREF,  the  comparator  does  not  \noperate  and  the  protection  does  not  start.\nWhen  the  IGBT  is  short-circuited  (phase-to-phase  short-circuit),  the  current  increases  slowly  due  to  \nthe  large  impedance  of  the  short-circuit  loop.  The  IGBT  can  still  go  into  saturation  normally,  and  then  as  the  short-\ncircuit  current  increases,  the  VCE  gradually  increases  until  it  desaturates  (see  Figure  11).  The  driver  can  detect  \nthe  short-circuit  state  only  when  the  IGBT  is  desaturated  and  start  the  short-circuit  protection.  Therefore,  the  \nresponse  time  of  type  2  short-circuit  protection  will  be  longer  than  that  of  type  1  short-circuit  protection.  When  the  \nIGBT  is  short-circuited  under  low  bus  voltage,  the  thru  current  is  small  due  to  the  low  bus  voltage,  the  IGBT  will  \nalso  show  the  same  characteristics  as  the  second-class  short-circuit  protection,  and  the  corresponding  protection  \nresponse  time  will  also  be  prolonged.  Note:  In  the  case  of  Type  II  short  circuit,  due  to  the  large  \nrandomness  of  the  short  circuit  circuit  impedance,  the  uncertainty  of  the  IGBT  desaturation  time  is  large.  \nTherefore,  before  the  IGBT  protection  action,  a  large  heat  loss  may  have  occurred  and  the  IGBT  may  be  \ndamaged.  That  is,  in  this  state,  the  short-circuit  protection  of  the  driving  area  cannot  guarantee  that  the  IGBT  is  \nnot  damaged,  and  the  system  needs  to  be  supplemented  by  other  means  such  as  overcurrent  \nprotection  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  IGBT.The  short-circuit  protection  logic  will  quickly  turn  off  the  IGBT  first  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  IGBT.  At  \nthe  same  time,  it  sends  information  to  the  primary  side,  so  that  the  SOx  pin  is  pulled  low  to  express  the  protection  \nstate.  The  protection  state  will  be  locked  for  a  tB  time,  and  then  automatically  return  to  the  normal  state.  The  \nprotection  circuits  of  the  six  channels  are  independent  of  each  other,  so  in  the  case  of  short-circuit  protection  on  \none  channel,  the  other  channel  can  still  work  in  a  normal  state.  The  control  system  needs  to  detect  \nthe  SO  signal  in  time  and  issue  a  system  blocking  command  according  to  the  strategy  (see  Figure  10).\nClass  I  short  circuit  protection\nWhen  a  type  of  short  circuit  (ie  shoot-through)  occurs  in  the  IGBT,  because  the  shoot-through  current  \nincreases  rapidly,  the  IGBT  will  quickly  desaturate,  and  VCE  will  quickly  return  to  a  high  level.  Therefore  CA  will  \nkeep  charging  so  that  VCEDT  will  increase  until  it  is  clamped  to  VISOx  (+15V  relative  to  VEx).  During  this  \nprocess,  VCEDT  crosses  VREF  (9V),  causing  the  comparator  to  flip,  which  activates  the  short-circuit  protection  \nlogic.\nVCEx0V\n-9V\nVCEDT  0VVGx\n0V\nShort-Circuit  type-9VVREF\ntSC tBTechnology  drives  the  future\ntBHigh\ntSCHigh\nTurn  on  \nprocessINx\nLow\n11/15www.qtjtec.com6AP0215T08- HPD  driver\nFigure  11  Logic  diagram  of  type  2  short  circuit  protection\nFigure  10  Logic  diagram  of  a  class  of  short-circuit  protectionFigure  9  VCEDT  signal  waveform  diagram  during  normal  turn-on\nVCE-OFFMachine Translated by Google\nRVBUS\nC2Voltage  Monitoring\n1kÿ\n+\nNTC  MonitoringR5\nR61.2kÿRNTC+5V_S+5V\nVExC5\nGND\nE5+5V\nGND-\nVBUS\n+5V\n-+5V\nGNDGNDNTC+5V_S+5V_SThe  driver  integrates  the  system  bus  voltage  sampling  function,  which  can  sample  the  whole\nThe  voltage  is  sampled  and  converted  into  a  voltage  that  can  be  directly  sampled  by  the  A/D\nRange  0~450V,  corresponding  to  output  voltage,  0~2V,  ratio  conversion\nNTC  temperature.
