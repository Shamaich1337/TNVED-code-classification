Data on \nthe SDA  pin may change only during SCL low  time \nperiods (refer to  Figure 4 ). Data changes during \nSCL high periods will indicate a start or stop \ncondition as defined below.  \nSTART CONDITION: A high -to-low transition of SDA \nwith SCL high is a start condition which must \nprecede any other command (refe r to Figure 5 ). \nSTOP CONDITION: A low -to-high transition of SDA \nwith SCL high is a stop condition. After a read \nsequence, the  stop command will place the EEPROM  \nin a standby power  mode (refer to Figure 5 ). \nACKNOWLEDGE: All address and data words are \nserial ly transmitted to and from the EEPROM in 8 -bit words. The EEPROM sends a zero during the ninth \nclock cycle  to acknowledge that it has received \neach word.   \nSTANDBY MODE: The FM24C 1024 A features  a \nlow-power standby mode which is enabled: (a) \nupon power -up an d (b) after the receipt of the stop \nbit and the  completion of any internal operations.  \nMemory  RESET : After an interruption in protocol, \npower loss or system  reset, any two-wire part can \nbe reset in follow ing these steps : \n1.

This is common to all the EEPROM \ndevices.  \nThe 1024K  EEPROM uses the two device address \nbits A2, A1 to allow as many as four devices on the \nsame bus. These bits must compare to their \ncorresponding hard -wired input pins. The A2, A1 pins \nuse an internal proprietary circuit that biases them to \na logic low condition if the pins are allowed to float.  \nThe seventh  bit (P 0) of the device address is a \nmemory  page address bit . This memory page  \naddress bit is the most significant bit of the data word \naddress that follows.  \nThe Module package  device address word also consists of a mandatory one, zero sequence fo r the \nfirst four most significant bits.  The next 3 bits are \nall zero . \nThe eighth bit of the device address is the read/write \noperation select bit. A read operation is initiated if this \nbit is high and a write operation is initiated if this bit is \nlow. \nUpon  a compare of the device address, the EEPROM  \nwill output a zero. If a compare is not made, the \ndevice  will return to a standby state.  \nNOISE PROTECTION: Special internal circuitry \nplaced on the SDA and SCL pins prevent small noise \nspikes from activating the  device.  \n \nDATA SECURITY: The FM24C1024A has a hardware  \ndata protection scheme that allows the user to write \nprotect the entire memory when the WP pin is at V CC. \n \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 1024A  2-wrie Serial EEPROM                      Ver 1.2                                    11 Write Operations   \nBYTE WRITE: A write operation requires two 8-bit \ndata word address follow ing the device address word \nand acknowledgment. Upon receipt of this address, \nthe EEPROM will again respond with a zero and \nthen clock in the first 8 -bit data word. Following \nreceipt of the 8 -bit data word, the EEPROM will \noutput a zero and the addressing device, such as a \nmicrocontroller, must terminate the write sequence \nwith a stop condition. At this time the EEPROM \nenters an internally -timed write cycle, tWR, to the \nnonvolatile memory. All inputs are disabled during \nthis write cycle and the EEPROM will not respond \nuntil the write is complete (refer to Figure 8). \nPAGE WRITE: The 1024 K EEPROM is capable of  \n256-byte page write s. \nA page write is initiated the same  way as a byte write, \nbut the microcontroller does not send a stop \ncondition after the first dat a word is clocked in. \nInstead, after the EEPROM  acknowledges receipt of \nthe first data word, the microcontroller can transmit \nup to 255 more data words. The EEPROM will \nrespond with a zero after each data word received. \nThe microcontroller must terminate t he page write \nsequence with a stop condition (refer to Figure 9). \nThe data word address lower 8 bits are internally \nincremented following the receipt of each data word. \nThe higher data word address bits are not \nincremented, retaining the memory page row lo cation. \nWhen the word address, internally generated, \nreaches the page boundary, the following byte is \nplaced at the beginning of the same page. If more \nthan 256 data words are transmitted to the EEPROM, \nthe data word address will “roll over” and previous \ndata will be overwritten.  \nACKNOWLEDGE POLLING: Once the internall y \ntimed write cycle has started and the EEPROM \ninputs are disabled, acknowledge polling can be \ninitiated. This involves sending a start condition \nfollowed by the device address word. The read/ write \nbit is representative of the operation desired. Only if \nthe internal write cycle has completed will the \nEEPROM respond with a zero allowing the read or \nwrite sequence to continue.  Read Operations  \nRead operations are initiated the same way as write \noperations with the exception that the read/write \nselect bit in the device address word is set to one. \nThere are three read operations: current address \nread, random address read and sequential read.  \nCURRENT ADDRESS READ: The internal data \nword address count er maintains the last address \naccessed during the last read or write operation, \nincremented by one. This address stays valid \nbetween operations as long as the chip power is \nmaintained. The address “roll over” during read is \nfrom the last byte of the last m emory page to the first \nbyte of the first page. The address “roll over” during \nwrite is from the last byte of  the current  page  to the \nfirst byte of the same page.  \nOnce the device address with the read/write select \nbit set to one is clocked in and acknowled ged by the \nEEPROM, the current address data word is serially \nclocked out. The microcontroller does not respond \nwith an input zero but does generate a following stop \ncondition (refer to Figure 10). \nRANDOM READ: A random read requires a \n“dummy” byte write se quence to load in the data \nword address. Once the device address word and \ndata word address are clocked in and acknowledged \nby the EEPROM, the microcontroller must generate \nanother start condition. The microcontroller now \ninitiates a current address read b y sending a device \naddress with the read/write select bit high. The \nEEPROM acknowledges the device address and \nserially clocks out  the data word. The microcontroller \ndoes not respond with a zero but does generate a \nfollowing stop condition (refer to Figure  11). \nSEQUENTIAL READ: Sequential reads are initiated \nby either a current address read or a random \naddress read. After the microcontroller receives a \ndata word, it responds with an  acknowledge. As long \nas the EEPROM receives an  acknowledge, it will \ncontinu e to increment the data word address and \nserially clock out sequential data words. When the \nmemory address limit  is reached, the data word \naddress will “roll over” and the sequential read will \ncontinue. The sequential read operation is \nterminated when the microcontroller does not \nrespond with a zero but does generate a following \nstop condition (refer to Figure 12). \n \n \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 1024A  2-wrie Serial EEPROM                      Ver 1.2                                    12  \nFigure 7．Device Address    \n \n \n            MSB                                    LSB \nPlastic \nPackage  1 0 1 0 A2 A1 P0 R/W \n \nModule \nPackage  1 0 1 0 0 0 0 R/W \n \n \nFigure 8．Byte Write    \n \n \n \nL\nS\nBA\nC\nKA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nP WORD ADDRESS\nSDA LINES\nT\nA\nR\nT\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESSW\nR\nI\nT\nE\nL\nS\nBR\n/\nWA\nC\nKFIRST SECOND\nWORD ADDRESS\nA\nC\nKDATA\n \n \n \n \nFigure 9．Page Write   \n \n \n \nDATA (n) DATA(n+x)S\nT\nO\nP\nA\nC\nKA\nC\nKA\nC\nKSDA LINE\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESS\nL\nS\nBR\n/\nWA\nC\nKW\nR\nI\nT\nEWORD ADDRESS (n)\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nA\nR\nTFIRST SECOND\nWORD ADDRESS (n)\nL\nS\nBL\nS\nB\n \n \n \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 1024A  2-wrie Serial EEPROM                      Ver 1.2                                    13  \nFigure 10．Current Address Read  \n \n \nSDA LINES\nT\nA\nR\nT\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESSR\nE\nA\nD\nR\n/\nWA\nC\nKDATA\nN\nO\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nP\n \n \n \n \nFigure 11． Random  Read   \n \n \n \nR\n/\nWA\nC\nKW\nR\nI\nT\nEFIRST WORD \nADDRESS n\nSDA LINE\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESSS\nT\nA\nR\nT\nDUMMY WRITEA\nC\nKDEVICE\nADDRESSS\nT\nA\nR\nTR\nE\nA\nD\nA\nC\nKDATA n\nN\nO\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nPSECOND WORD \nADDRESS n\nA\nC\nK\n \n \n \n \nFigure 12． Sequential Read    \n \n \nSDA LINEDEVICE\nADDRESS\nR\n/\nWA\nC\nKR\nE\nA\nD DATA n DATA n+1 DATA n+2\nA\nC\nKA\nC\nKA\nC\nKN\nO\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nP DATA(n+x)\n \n \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 1024A  2-wrie Serial EEPROM                      Ver 1.2                                    14 Ordering Information   \n \nCompany Prefix\nProduct Family\nProduct Density\nPackage Type  (1)  FM = Fudan Microelectronics Co.,ltd\n24C = 2-Wire Serial EEPROM\n1024 = 1024K-bit\nSO = 8-pin SOP      M2F or M2P = 8-pin Module Package    \nTS  = 8-pin TSSOP M3F or M3P = 6-pin Module Package FM24C1024 -PP\nHSF ID Code (2)\nBlank or R = RoHS Compliant\nG = RoHS Compliant, Halogen-free, Antimony-free-H-C\nProduct Carrier\nU = Tube\nT = Tape and Reel\nR = Module ReelA\nSupply Voltage\nA = 1.7V to 5.5V\n \nNote:  \n1.
