It consists of a low noise digital phase  frequency detector (PFD), a precision charge pump, and  \na programmable reference divider. There is a  Σ-Δ based \nfractional interpolator  to allow programmable fractional- N \ndivision. The INT, FRAC, and MOD registers define an  \noverall N divider ( N = (INT + (FRAC /MOD ))). In addition,  \nthe 4 -bit re ference counter (R counter) allows selectable  \nREFIN frequencies at the PFD input. A complete phase-  \nlocked loop (PLL) can be implemented if the synthesizer is  \nused with an external loop filter and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO).  \nA simple 3 -wire in terface controls all on -chip registers.  \nThe device operates with a power supply ranging from  \n2.7 V to 3.3 V and can be powered down when not in use.  \n \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM  \nLOCK\nDETECT\nN-COUNTERCP\nRFCP3 RFCP2 RFCP1REFERENCE\nDATA\nLE24-BIT\nDATA\nREGISTERCLKREF INAVDD\nAGNDVDD\nVDDDGND\nRDIV\nNDIV\nDGND CPGNDDVDD VPSDV DD RSET\nRFINA\nRFINBOUTPUT\nMUX–+\nHIGH-ZPHASE\nFREQUENC Y\nDETECT ORADF4153\nTHIRD ORDER\nFRACTIONA L\nINTERPOL ATOR\n MODULUS\nREGFRACTION\nREG INTEGER\nREGCURRENT\nSETTING×2\nDOUBLER 4-BIT\nR COUNTER\nCHARGE\nPUM P\n03685-001MUXOUT\n \nFigure 1. \n \nADF4153  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

RF Input Stage RF INT DIVIDER \nThe RF INT CMOS counter allows a division ratio in the PLL \nfeedback counter. Division ratios from 31 to 511 are allowed. \nINT, FRAC, MOD, AND R RELATIONSHIP \nThe INT, FRAC, and MOD values, in conjunction with the  \nR counter, make it possible to generate output frequencies that \nare spaced by fractions of the phase frequency detector (PFD). See the RF Synthesizer: A Worked Example section for more \ninformation. The RF VCO frequency (RF\nOUT) equation is \nRF OUT = F PFD × (INT + (FRAC /MOD )) (1) \nwhere: \nRF OUT is the output frequency of the external voltage controlled \noscillator (VCO). INT is the preset divide ratio of the binary 9-bit counter (31  \nto 511). MOD  is the preset fractional modulus (2 to 4095). \nFRAC  is the numerator of the fractional division (0 to MOD − 1). \nThe PFD frequency is given by: \nF\nPFD = REF IN × (1 + D )/R (2) \nwhere: REF\nIN is the reference input frequency. \nD is the REF IN doubler bit. \nR is the preset divide ratio of the binary 4-bit programmable \nreference counter (1 to 15). \nRF R COUNTER \nThe 4-bit RF R counter allows the input reference frequency \n(REF IN) to be divided down to produce the reference clock to \nthe PFD. Division ratios from 1 to 15 are allowed. \nTHIRD-ORDER\nFRACTIONAL\nINTERPOLATOR\nFRAC\nVALUEMOD\nREGINT\nREGRF N DIVIDER N = INT + FRAC/MOD\nFROM RF\nINPUT STAGE TO PFD\nN-COUNTER\n03685-016 \nFigure 14.

Figure 15 is a simplified schematic of \nthe phase frequency detector. The PFD includes a fixed delay element that sets the width of the antibacklash pulse, which is typically 3 ns. This pulse ensures  that there is no dead zone in the \nPFD transfer function and gives a consistent reference spur level.  \nU3\nCLR2\nQ2 D2\nU2DOWNUP\nHI\nHICP\n–IN+IN\nCHARGE\nPUM PDELAYCLR1Q1 D1\nU1\n03685-017 \nFigure 15.

MUXOUT Schematic  INPUT SHIFT REGISTER S \nThe ADF4153 digital section includes a 4- bit RF R counter,  \na 9-bit RF N counter, a 12 -bit FRAC counter, and a 12 -bit \nmodulus counter. Data is clocked into the 24 -bit shift register \non each rising edge of CLK. The data is clocked in MSB first. Data is transferred from the shift register to one of four latches on the ris ing edge of LE. The destination latch is determined by \nthe state of the two control bits (C2 and C1) in the shift register. These are the 2 LSBs, DB1 and DB0, as shown in Figure 2. The \ntruth table for these bits is shown in Table 6. Table 7 shows a \nsummary of how the registers are programmed.   \nPROGRAM MODES  \nTable 6 through Table 11 show how to set up the program \nmodes in the ADF4153.   \nThe ADF4153 programmable modulus  is double buffered. This \nmeans that two events have to occur before the part uses a new modulus value. First, the new modulus value is latched into the device by writing to the R divider register. Second, a new write must be performed on the N divider reg ister. Therefore , to \nensur e that the modulus value is loaded correctly, the N divider \nregister must be written to any time that the modulus value is updated.  \nTable 6.

G | Page 17 of 25 N DIVIDER REGISTER, R0  \nWith R0[1, 0] set to [0, 0], the on -chip N divider register  \nis programmed. Table 8 shows the input data format for \nprogramming this register. \n9-Bit INT Value  \nThese nin e bits control what is loaded as the INT value. This is \nused to determine the overall feedback division factor. It is used \nin Equation 1 (see the INT, FRAC, MOD, and R Relationship  \nsection).  \n12- Bit FRAC Value  \nThese 12 bits control what is loaded as the FRAC value into the fractional interpolator. This is part of what determines the overall feedback division factor. It is also used in Equation 1. The FRAC value must be less than or equal to the value loaded \ninto the MOD register.  \nFastlock  \nWhen set to logic high, fastlock is enabled. This sets the charge \npump current to its maximum value. When set to logic low, the charge pump current is equal to the value programmed into  the \nfunction register. Also, if MUXOUT is programmed to setting the fastlock switch, MUXOUT is shorted to ground when the fastlock bit is 1 and is high impedance when this bit is 0.  \nR DIVIDER REGISTER, R1 \nWith R1[1, 0] set to [0, 1], the on -chip R divider  register is \nprogrammed. Table 9 shows the input data format for \nprogramming this register. \nLoad Control  \nWhen set to logic high, the value being programmed in the \nmodu lus is not loaded into the modulus. Instead, it sets the \nresync delay of the Σ- Δ. This is done to ensure phase resync \nwhen changing frequencies. See the Phase Resync  section for \nmore information and a worked example.  \nMUXOUT  \nThe on -chip multiplexer is controlled by DB 22, DB 21, and  \nDB20 on the ADF4153. See Table 9 for the truth table.  \nDigital Lock Detect  \nThe digital lock detect output goes high if there are 24 succes -\nsive PFD cycles with an input error of less than 15 ns (for LDP \nis 0, see the Control Register, R2  section for a more thorough \nexplanation of the LDP bit). It stays high until a new channel is programmed or until the error at the PFD input exceeds 30  ns \nfor one or  more cycles. If the loop bandwidth is narrow compared  \nto the PFD frequency, the error at the PFD inputs may drop \nbelow 15 ns for 24 cycles around a cycle slip. Therefore, the \ndigital lock detect may go falsely high for a short period until \nthe error again exceeds 30 ns. In this ca se, the digital lock detect \nis reliable only as a loss- of-lock detector.  Prescaler (P/P + 1)  \nThe dual -modulus prescaler (P/P + 1), along with the INT, \nFRAC, and MOD counters, determines the overall division ratio \nfrom the RF IN to the PFD input.  \nOperating at CML levels, it takes the clock from the RF input \nstage and divides it down for the counters. It is based on a synchronous 4/5 core. When set to 4/5, the maximum RF frequency allowed is 2 GHz. Therefore, when operating the \nADF4153 above 2 GHz, this must be set to 8/9. The prescaler \nlimits the INT value.  \nWith P = 4/5, N\nMIN = 31.  \nWith P = 8/9, N MIN = 91.  \n4-Bit R Counter  \nThe 4 -bit R counter allows the input reference frequency \n(REF IN) to be divided down to produce the reference clock to \nthe phase frequency detector (PFD). Division ratios from 1 to 15 are allowed.  \n12- Bit Interpolator MOD Value  \nThese  programmable bits set the fractional modulus. This is the \nratio of the PFD frequency to the channel step resolution on the RF output. Refer to the RF Synthesizer: A Worked Example section for more information.  \nThe ADF4153 programmable modulus is double buffered. This \nmeans that two events have to occur before the part uses a ne w \nmodulus value. First, the new modulus value is latched into the \ndevice by writing to the R divider register. Second, a new write must be performed on the N divider register. Therefore, any time that the modulus value has been updated, the N divider regis ter must then be written to in order to ensure that the \nmodulus value is loaded correctly.  \nCONTROL REGISTER, R2  \nWith R2[1, 0] set to [1, 0], the on -chip control register  \nis programmed. Table 10 shows the input data format for \nprogramming this register. \nRF Counter Reset  \nDB2 is the RF counter reset bit for the ADF4153. When this  \nis 1, the RF synthesizer counters are held in reset. For normal operation, this bit should b e 0. \nRF Charge Pump Three -State  \nDB3 puts the charge pump into three -state mode when \nprogrammed to 1. It should be set to 0 for normal operation.  \nRF Power -Down  \nDB4 on the ADF4153 provides the programmable power -down \nmode. Setting this bit to 1 performs a power -down. Setting this \nbit to 0 returns the synthesizer to normal operation. While in software power -down mode, the part retains all information in \nits registers. Only when supplies are removed are the register \ncontents lost.  \n \nADF4153  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. G | Page 18 of 25 When a power -down is activate d, the following events occur:  \n1. All active dc current paths are removed.  \n2. The synthesizer counters are forced to their load state \nconditions.  \n3. The charge pump is forced into three -state mode.  \n4. The digital lock detect circuitry is reset.  \n5. The RF IN input is debiased.  \n6. The input register remains active and capable of loading \nand latching data.  \nLock Detect Precision (LDP)  \nWhen DB5 is programmed to 0, 24 consecutive PFD cycles of 15 ns must occur before digital lock detect is set. When this bit \nis progr ammed to 1, 40 consecutive reference cycles of 15 ns \nmust occur before digital lock detect is set.  \nPhase Detector Polarity  \nDB6 in the ADF4153 sets the phase detector polarity. When the \nVCO characteristics are positive, this should be set to 1. When they ar e negative, it should be set to 0.  \nCharge Pump Current Setting  \nDB7, DB8, DB9, and DB10 set the charge pump current setting. This should be set to the charge pump current that the loop filter is designed with (see Table 10). \nREF IN Doubler  \nSetting DB11 to 0 feeds the REF IN signal directly to the 4 -bit RF \nR counter, disabling the doubler. Setting this bit to 1 multiplies the REF\nIN frequency by a factor of 2 before feeding into the 4 -bit \nR counter. When the doubler is disabled, the REF IN falling edge \nis the active edge at the PFD input to the fractional synthesizer. When the doubler is enabled, both the rising and falling edges \nof REF\nIN become active edges at the PFD input.  \nWhen the doubler is enabled and the lowest spur mode is chos en, \nthe in -band phase noise performance is sensitive to the REF IN \nduty cycle. The phase noise degradation can be as much as 5 dB \nfor the REF IN duty cycl es outside a 45% to 55% range. The phase \nnoise is insensitive to the REF IN duty cycle in the lowest noise \nmode and in the lowest noise and spur mode. The phase noise \nis insensitive to REF IN duty cycle when the doubler is disabled.  \nThe maximum allowed REF IN frequency when the doubler is \nenabled is 30 MHz.  NOISE AND SPUR REGIS TER, R3  \nWith R3[1, 0] set to [1, 1], the on -chip noise and spur register  \nis programmed. Table 11 shows the input data format for \nprogramming this register. \nNoise and Spur Mode  \nNoise and spur mode allows the user to optimize a design either for improved spurious performance or for improved phase \nnoise performance. When the low spur setting is chosen, dither \nis enabled. This randomizes the fractional quantization noise so \nthat it resembles white noise rather than spurious noise. As a result, the part is optimized for improved spurious performance. This operation would normally be used when the PLL clos ed-loop bandwidth is wide, for fast -locking applica -\ntions. (Wide -loop bandwidth is seen as a loop bandwidth \ngreater than 1/10 of the RF\nOUT channel step resolution (f RES).) A \nwide -loop filter does not attenuate the spurs to the same level as \na narrow -loop b andwidth.  \nWhen the low noise and spur setting is enabled, dither is disabled. This optimizes the synthesizer to operate with \nimproved noise performance. However, the spurious \nperformance is degraded in this mode compared to the low spur setting.  \nTo furth er improve noise performance, the lowest noise setting \noption can be used, which reduces the phase noise. As well as disabling the dither, it also ensures that the charge pump is operating in an optimum region for noise performance. This setting is extremely useful where a narrow -loop filter band -\nwidth is available. The synthesizer ensures extremely low noise and the filter attenuates the spurs. The typical performance \ncharacteristics give the user an idea of the trade- off in a typical \nW-CDMA  setup for the different noise and spur settings.  \nRESERVED BITS  \nThese bits should be set to 0 for normal operation.  \nData Sheet  ADF4153  \n \nRev. G | Page 19 of 25 INITIALIZATION SEQUE NCE  \nThe following initialization sequence should be followed upon \npowering up the part:  \n1. Write all zeros to the noise and spur register. This ensures \nthat all test modes are cleared.  \n2. Write again to the noise and spur register, this time \nselecting which noise and spur mode is required. For example, writing Hex adecimal  0003C7 to the part selects  \nlowest noise mode . \n3. Enable the counter reset in the control register by writing a 1 to DB2; also select the required settings in the control register. If using the phase resync function, set the resync \nbits to the required settings.  \n4. Load the R divider regi ster (with load c ontrol DB23   \nset to 0).  \n5. Load the N divider register.  \n6. Disable the counter reset by writing a 0 to DB2 in the \ncontrol register. \nThe part now locks to the set frequency.  \nIf using the phase resync function, an extra step is needed after \nStep 3 . This involves loading the R divider register with load \ncontrol = 1 and the required delay interval in place of the MOD \nvalue. The previous sequence can then be f ollowed ensuring \nthat in Step 4  the value of MOD is written to the R divider \nregister with lo ad control = 0.  \nSee the Spur Consistency  and Phase Resync  sections for mo re \ninformation on the phase resync feature.  \nRF SYNTHESIZER: A WO RKED EXAMPLE  \nThe following equation governs how the synthesi zer is \nprogrammed:  \nRF OUT = [INT + (FRAC /MOD )] × [FPFD] (3) \nwhere:  \nRF OUT is the RF frequency output.  \nINT is the integer division factor.  \nFRAC  is the fractionality.  \nMOD  is the modulus.  \nThe PFD frequency is given by:  \nFPFD = [REF IN × (1 + D )/R] (4) \nwhere:  \nREF IN is the reference frequency input.  \nD is the RF REF IN doubler bit.  \nR is the RF reference division facto r. For example, in a GSM 1 800 system, where 1.8 GHz RF \nfrequency output (RF OUT) is required, a 13 MHz reference \nfrequency input (REF IN) is available and a 200 kHz channel \nresolution (f RES) is required on the RF output.  \nMOD  = REF IN/fRES \nMOD  = 13 MHz /200 kHz = 65  \nFrom Equation 4:  \nFPFD = [13 MHz × (1 + 0)/1] = 13 MHz  (5) \n1.8 G = 13 MHz × ( INT + FRAC /65)  \nwhere  INT = 138; FRAC = 30  (6) \nMODULUS  \nThe choice of modulus (MOD) depends on the reference signal \n(REF IN) available and the channel resolution (f RES) required at \nthe RF output. For example, a GSM system with 13 MHz REF IN sets \nthe modulus to 65. This means that the RF output resolution (f RES) \nis the 200 kHz (13 MHz/65) necessary for GSM. With dither off, \nthe fractional spur interval depends on the modulus values chosen. \nSee Table 12 for more information.  \nREFERENCE DOUBLER AN D REFERENCE DIVIDER  \nThe reference doubler on -chip allows the input reference signal \nto be doubled. This is useful for increasing the PFD comparison frequency. Making the PFD frequency higher improves the \nnoise performance of the system . Doubling the PFD frequency \nusually improves noise performance by 3 dB. It is important to \nnote that the PFD cannot be operated above 32 MHz due to a limitation in the speed of the Σ -Δ circuit of the N divider.  \n12-BIT PROGRAMMABLE MOD ULUS  \nUnlike most othe r fractional -N PLLs, the ADF4153 allows the \nuser to program the modulus over a 12 -bit range. This means \nthat the user can set up the part in many different configu -\nrations for the application, when combined with the reference \ndoubler and the 4 -bit R counte r.  \nThe following is an example of an application that requires  \n1.75 GHz RF and 200 kHz channel step resolution. The system \nhas a 13 MHz reference signal.  \nOne possible setup is feeding the 13 MHz directly to the PFD \nand programming the modulus to divide b y 65. This result s in \nthe required 200 kHz resolution.  \nAnother possible setup is using the reference doubler to create \n26 MHz from the 13 MHz input signal. This 26 MHz is then fed \ninto the PFD. The modulus is now programmed to divide by \n130. This also resu lts in 200 kHz resolution and offers superior \nphase noise performance over the previous setup.  \nADF4153 Data Sheet\n \nRev. G | Page 20 of 25 The programmable modulus is also very useful for multi-\nstandard applications. If a dual-mode phone requires PDC  and GSM 1800 standards, the programmable modulus is of  great benefit. PDC requires 25 kHz channel step resolution, \nwhereas GSM 1800 requires 200 kHz channel step resolution.  \nA 13 MHz reference signal can be fed directly to the PFD.  The modulus is programmed to 520 when in PDC mode (13 MHz/520 = 25 kHz). The modulus is reprogrammed to 65for GSM 1800 operation (13 MHz/65 = 200 kHz). It is \nimportant that the PFD frequency remains constant (13 MHz). \nThis allows the user to design one loop filter that can be used in both setups without running into stability issues. It is the ratio of the RF frequency to the PFD frequency that affects the loop design. By keeping this relationship constant, the same loop \nfilter can be used in both applications. \nFASTLOCK WITH SPURIOUS OPTIMIZATION \nAs mentioned in the Noise and Spur Mode section, the part can \nbe optimized for spurious performance. However, in fastlocking \napplications, the loop bandwidth needs to be wide, and therefore the filter does not provide much attenuation of the \nspurs. The programmable charge pump can be used to get \naround this issue. The filter is designed for a narrow-loop bandwidth so that steady-state spurious specifications are met. \nThis is designed using the lowest charge pump current setting. \nTo implement fastlock during a frequency jump, the charge \npump current is set to the maximum setting for the duration of the jump by asserting the fastlock bit in the N divider register. \nThis widens the loop bandwidth, which improves lock time. To \nmaintain loop stability while in wide bandwidth mode, the loop filter needs to be modified. This is achieved by switching in a resistor (R1A) in parallel with the damping resistor in the loop filter (see Figure 17). MUXOUT needs to be set to the fastlock \nswitch to use the internal switch. For example, if the charge \npump current is increased by 16, the damping resistor, R1, \nneeds to be decreased by ¼ while in wide bandwidth mode.  \nADF4153VCO\nC2 C1CP\nFLMUXOUT\nR1R1A\n03685-029 \nFigure 17. ADF4153 with Fastlock \nThe value of R1A is then chosen so that the total parallel \nresistance of R1 and R1A equals 1/4 of R1 alone. This gives  an overall 4× increase in loop bandwidth, while maintaining \nstability in wide bandwidth mode. When the PLL has locked to the new frequency, the charge \npump is again programmed to the lowest charge pump current setting by setting the fastlock bit to 0. The internal switch opens and the damping resistor reverts to its original value. This \nnarrows the loop bandwidth to its original cutoff frequency  \nto allow better attenuation of the spurs than the wide-loop \nbandwidth. \nSPUR MECHANISMS \nThe following section describes the three different spur mechan-\nisms that arise with a fractional-N synthesizer and how to \nminimize them in the ADF4153. \nFractional Spurs \nThe fractional interpolator in the ADF4153 is a third-order Σ-Δ \nmodulator (SDM) with a modulus (MOD) that is programmable to any integer value from 2 to 4095. In low spur mode (dither \nenabled), the minimum allowed value of MOD is 50. The SDM is clocked at the PFD reference rate (F\nPFD) that allows PLL \noutput frequencies to be synthesized at a channel step \nresolution of F PFD/MOD. \nIn lowest noise mode and low noise and spur mode (dither off), \nthe quantization noise from the Σ-Δ modulator appears as frac-\ntional spurs. The interval between spurs is F PFD/L, where L is the \nrepeat length of the code sequence in the digital Σ-Δ modulator. \nFor the third-order modulator used in the ADF4153, the repeat \nlength depends on the value of MOD, as shown in Table 12. \nTable 12. Fractional Spurs with Dither Off  \nCondition (Dither Off) Repeat  \nLength Spur Interval \nIf MOD is divisible by 2, but not 3 2 × MOD Channel step/2 \nIf MOD is divisible by 3, but not 2 3 × MOD Channel step/3 \nIf MOD is divisible by 6 6 × MOD Channel step/6 \nOtherwise MOD Channel step \nIn low spur mode (dither enabled), the repeat length is \nextended to 221 cycles, regardless of the value of MOD, which \nmakes the quantization error spectrum look like broadband noise. This can degrade the in-band phase noise at the PLL \noutput by as much as 10 dB. Therefore, for lowest noise, dither off is a better choice, particularly when the final loop BW is low \nenough to attenuate even the lowest frequency fractional spur.  \nInteger Boundary Spurs \nAnother mechanism for fractional spur creation is interactions \nbetween the RF VCO frequency and the reference frequency. \nWhen these frequencies are not integer related (which is the point of a fractional-N synthesizer), spur sidebands appear on the VCO output spectrum at an offset frequency that corresponds to the beat note or difference frequency between an integer multiple of the reference and the VCO frequency.  \nThese spurs are attenuated by the loop filter and are more \nnoticeable on channels close to integer multiples of the \nreference where the difference frequency can be inside the  \nloop bandwidth, therefore, the name integer boundary spurs. \nData Sheet  ADF4153  \n \nRev. G | Page 21 of 25 Reference Spurs  \nReference spurs are generally not a problem in fractional -N \nsynthesizers because the reference offset is far outside the  \nloop bandwidth. However, any reference feedthrough mechan -\nism that bypasses the loop can cause a problem. One such \nmechan ism is feedthrough of low levels of on -chip reference \nswitching noise out through the RF IN pin back to the VCO, \nresulting in reference spur levels as high as – 90 dBc. Care \nshould be taken in the PCB layout to ensure that the VCO  \nis well s eparated from the input reference to avoid a possible \nfeed-through path on the board.  \nSPUR CONSISTENCY \nWhen jumping from Frequency A to Frequency B and then \nback again using some fractional -N synthesizers, the spur levels \noften differ each time Frequency A is programmed. However,  \nin the ADF4153, the spur levels on any particular channel are \nalways consistent.  \nPHASE RESYNC  \nThe output of a fractional -N PLL can settle to any one of MOD \nphase offsets with respect to the input referenc e, where MOD  \nis the fractional modulus. The phase resync feature in the ADF4153 can be used to produce a consistent output phase offset with respect to the input reference. This is necessary  \nin applications where the output phase and frequency are important, such as digital beam -forming.  \nWhen phase resync is enabled, an internal timer generates sync signals at intervals of t\nSYNC given by the following formula:  \ntSYNC = RESYNC  × RESYNC_DELAY  × tPFD \nwhere tPFD is the PFD reference period.  \nRESYNC is the decimal value programmed i n Bits DB[15 …12] \nof Register R2 and can be any integer in the range of 1 to 15. If RESYNC is programmed to its default value of all zeros, then  \nthe phase resync feature is disabled.   \nIf phase resync is enabled, then RESYNC_DELAY must be programmed to a val ue that is an integer mul tiple of the value  \nof MOD. RESYNC_DELAY is the decimal value programmed into the MOD bits ( DB[13…3] of Register R1  when load \ncontrol (Bit DB23 of Register R1) = 1.  \nWhen a new frequency is programmed, the second next sync \npulse after the LE rising edge is used to resynchronize the out put \nphase to the reference. The t\nSYNC time should be programmed to \na value that is a t least as long as the worst -case lock time. Doing \nso guarantees that the phase resync occurs after the last cycle slip in the PLL settling transient.  \nIn the example shown in Figure 18, the PFD reference is  \n25 MHz and MOD = 125 for a 200 kHz channel spacing.  \nt\nSYNC is set to 400  µs by programming RESYNC = 10 and \nRESYNC_DELAY = 1000.

Various passive and active filter architectures are allowed.  \nINTERFACING  \nThe ADF4153 has a simple SPI® -compatible serial interface  \nfor writing to the device. CLK, DATA, and LE control the data transfer. When latch enable (LE) is high, the 22 bits that are clocked into the input register on each rising edge of SCLK are transferred to the appropriate latch. See Figure 2 for the timing \ndiagram and Table 6 for the register truth  table .  \nThe maximum allowable serial clock rate is 20 MHz.  \nADuC812 Interface  \nFigure 19 shows the interface between the ADF4153 and the \nADuC812 MicroConverter®. Because  the ADuC812 is based on \nan 8051 core, this i nterface can be used with any 8 051- based \nmicro -controller. The MicroConverter is set up for SPI master \nmode with CPHA = 0. To initiate the operation, the I/O port \ndriving LE is brought low. Each latch of the ADF4153 needs a 24-\nbit word, which is accomplished by writing three 8 -bit bytes  from \nthe MicroConverter to the device. After the third byte is written, the LE input should be brought high to complete the transfer.  \nADuC812 ADF4153\nSCLOCK CLK\nDATA\nLE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)MOSI\nI/O PORTS\n03685-024 \nFigure 19.

This means that the maximum rate at \nwhich the output frequency can be changed is 180 kHz.  \nADSP -21xx Interface  \nFigure 20 shows the interface between the ADF4153 and the \nADSP -21xx digital signal processor. As discussed previously,  \nthe ADF4153 needs a 24- bit serial word for each latch write. \nThe easiest way to accomplish this using the ADSP -21xx family \nis to use the autobuffered transmit mode of operation with \nalternate framing. This provides a means for transmitting an \nentire block of serial data before an interrupt is generated.  Set up the word length for eight bits and use three memory \nlocations for e ach 24 -bit word. To program each 24 -bit latch, \nstore the three 8 -bit bytes, enable the autobuffered mode, and \nwrite to the transmit register of the DSP . This last operation \ninitiates the autobuffer transfer.  \nADSP-21xx ADF4153\nSCLK CLK\nDATA\nLE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)DT\nTFS\nI/O FLAGS\n03685-025 \nFigure 20.

The land should be centered on the pad. This ensures that the solder joint size is maximized.  \nThe bottom of the chip scale package has a central thermal pad. \nThe thermal pad on the PCB should be at least as large as this \nexposed pad. On t he PCB, there should be a clearance of at least \n0.25 mm between the thermal pad and the inner edges of the \npad pattern. This ensures that shorting is avoided.  \nThermal vias can be used on the PCB thermal pad to improve thermal performance of the package. If  vias are used, they should \nbe incorporated in the thermal pad at 1.2 mm pitch grid. The via diameter should be between 0.3 mm and 0.33 mm, and the \nvia barrel should be plated with one  ounce of copper to plug the \nvia. The user should connect the PDB therma l pad to AGND.  \n \n \nData Sheet  ADF4153  \n \nRev. G | Page 23 of 25 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nLOCAL OSCILLATOR FOR  A GSM BASE STATION \nTRANSMITTER  \nFigure 21 shows the  ADF4153 being used with a VCO to \nproduce the local oscillator (LO) for a GSM base station \ntransmitter.  \nThe reference input signal is applied to the circuit at REF IN and,  \nin this case, is terminated in 50 Ω. A 25 MHz reference is used, which is fed direct ly to the PFD. To achieve 200 kHz channel \nspacing, a modulus of 125 is necessary. Note that with a modulus \nof 125, which is not divisible by 2, 3 or 6, subfractional spurs are \navoided. See the Spur Mechanisms  section for more information.  \nThe charge pump output of the ADF4153 drives the loop filter. The charge pump current is I\nCP = 5 mA. ADI simPLL is used to \ncalculate the loop filter. It is designed for a loop bandwidth of 20 kHz and a phase margin of 45 degrees.  \nThe loop filter output drives the VCO, which in turn is fed back \nto th e RF input of the PLL synthesizer. It also drives the RF outp ut \nterminal. A T -circuit configuration provides 50 Ω matching \nbetween the VCO output, the RF output, and the RF\nIN terminal \nof the synthesizer.  \nIn a PLL system, it is important to know when the loop is in lock. This is achieved by using the MUXOUT signal from the \nsynthesizer. The MUXOUT pin can be programmed to monitor \nvarious internal signals in the synthesizer. One of these is the lock detect signal.\n \nVDD VP\nAVDD DVDD\nADF4153VP\n22nF 82Ω160Ω\n270nFVCO190-902TVCCRFOUT\n18Ω18Ω\n18Ω100pF100pF\n1000pF 1000pF\n51Ω\n5.1kΩREFINSVDD\n5\n34 97 15 16\n61414\n102 2\nRSETMUXOUTLOCK\nDETECT\n100pF100pFCPGND\nDGNDAGNDRFINA\nRFINBCLK\nDATA\nLE\nDECOUPLING CA PACITORS SHOULD BE PLACED\nAS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE PINS.CP\n810\nFREFIN 8.2nF100nF 10µF 100nF 10µF10pF 100nF\n51ΩSPI-COM PATIBLE SERIA L BUS\n03685-028 \nFigure 21.
