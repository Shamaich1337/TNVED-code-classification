These amplifiers combine very low noise and supply current with a 100MHz gain bandwidth product, a 25V/µs slew rate, and are optimized for low supply signal conditioning systems.\nThese amplifiers maintain their performance for supplies \nfrom 2.5V to 12.6V and are specified at 3V , 5V and ±5V supplies. Harmonic distortion is less than –80dBc at 1MHz making these amplifiers suitable in low power data acquisition systems.\nThe L T6202 is available in the 5-pin TSOT-23 and the 8-pin  \nSO, while the L T6203 comes in 8-pin SO and MSOP pack -\nages with standard op amp pinouts. For compact layouts \nthe L T6203 is also available in a tiny fine line leadless package (DFN), while the quad L T6204 is available in the 16-pin SSOP and 14-pin SO packages. These devices can be used as plug-in replacements for many op amps to improve input/output range and noise performance.\nLow Noise 4- to 2-Wire Local Echo Cancellation Differential ReceiverFEATURES\nAPPLICATIONSn Low Noise Voltage: 1.9nV/√Hz (100kHz)\nn Low Supply Current: 3mA/Amp Max\nn Gain Bandwidth Product: 100MHz\nn Dual L T6203 in Tiny DFN Package\nn Low Distortion: –80dB at 1MHz\nn Low Offset Voltage: 500µV Max\nn Wide Supply Range: 2.5V to 12.6V\nn Input Common Mode Range Includes Both Rails\nn Output Swings Rail-to-Rail\nn Common Mode Rejection Ratio 90dB Typ\nn Unity Gain Stable\nn Low Noise Current: 1.1pA/√ Hz\nn Output Current: 30mA Min\nn Operating Temperature Range –40°C to 125°C\nn Low Profile (1mm) SOT-23 (ThinSOT™) Package\nn Low Noise, Low Power Signal Processing\nn Active Filters\nn Rail-to-Rail Buffer Amplifiers\nn Driving A/D Converters\nn DSL Receivers\nn Battery Powered/Battery Backed EquipmentL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks of Linear \nTechnology Corporation.

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: Inputs are protected by back-to-back diodes and diodes to each \nsupply. If the inputs are taken beyond the supplies or the differential input voltage exceeds 0.7V, the input current must be limited to less than 40mA.\nNote 3: A heat sink may be required to keep the junction temperature \nbelow the absolute maximum rating when the output is shorted indefinitely.\nNote 4: The L T6202C/L T6203C/L T6204C are guaranteed to meet specified \nperformance from 0°C to 70°C. The L T6202C/L T6203C/L T6204C are designed, characterized and expected to meet specified performance from –40°C to 85°C, but are not tested or QA sampled at these temperatures.\nThe L T6202I/L T6203I/L T6204I are guaranteed to meet specified \nperformance from –40°C to 85°C. The L T6202H and L T6203H are guaranteed to meet specified performance from –40°C to 125°C.Note 5: Matching parameters are the difference between the two amplifiers A and D and between B and C of the L T6204; between the two amplifiers of the L T6203. CMRR and PSRR match are defined as follows: CMRR and PSRR are measured in µV/V on the identical amplifiers. The difference is calculated between the matching sides in µV/V. The result is converted to dB.\nNote 6: Minimum supply voltage is guaranteed by power supply rejection \nratio test.\nNote 7: Output voltage swings are measured between the output and \npower supply rails.\nNote 8: This parameter is not 100% tested.Note 9: Full-power bandwidth is calculated from the slew rate:  \nFPBW = SR/2πV\nP \nNote 10: Differential gain and phase are measured using a Tektronix TSG120YC/NTSC signal generator and a Tektronix 1780R Video Measurement Set.

parallel that are biased on simultaneously when the common mode voltage is at least 1.5V from either rail. This topology allows the input stage to swing from the positive supply voltage to the negative supply voltage. As the common mode voltage swings beyond V\nCC – 1.5V , \ncurrent source I 1 saturates and current in Q1/Q4 is zero. \nFeedback is maintained through the Q2/Q3 differential amplifier , but with an input g\nm reduction of 1/2. A similar \neffect occurs with I 2 when the common mode voltage \nswings within 1.5V of the negative rail. The effect of the g\nm reduction is a shift in the V OS as I 1 or I 2 saturate.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInput bias current normally flows out of the + and – inputs. The magnitude of this current increases when the input common mode voltage is within 1.5V of the negative rail, and only Q1/Q4 are active. The polarity of this current reverses when the input common mode voltage is within 1.5V of the positive rail and only Q2/Q3 are active.\nThe second stage is a folded cascode and current mir -\nror that converts the input stage differential signals to a \nsingle ended output. Capacitor C1 reduces the unity cross  \nfrequency and improves the frequency stability with-out degrading the gain bandwidth of the amplifier . The  \ndifferential drive generator supplies current to the output transistors that swing from rail-to-rail.\nDIFFERENTIAL\nDRIVE \nGENERATOR+\n–R1 R2\nR3 R4 R5Q2 Q3Q5Q6\nQ9\nQ8 Q7\nQ10Q11\nQ1 Q4I1\nI2 D3D2 D1DESD2\nDESD4 DESD3DESD1\nDESD5\nDESD6+\n–VBIAS\nCM C1+V\n+V+V\n+V –V –V–VV+\nV–6203/04 F01\nFigure 1. Simplified Schematic\nLT6202/LT6203/LT6204\n19\n620234fdAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInput Protection\nThere are back-to-back diodes, D1 and D2, across the  \n+ and – inputs of these amplifiers to limit the differential \ninput voltage to ±0.7V . The inputs of the L T6202/L T6203/L T6304 do not have internal resistors in series with the input transistors. This technique is often used to protect the input devices from over voltage that causes excessive currents to flow. The addition of these resistors would significantly degrade the low noise voltage of these ampli-fiers. For instance, a 100Ω resistor in series with each input would generate 1.8nV/√Hz of noise, and the total amplifier noise voltage would rise from 1.9nV/√ Hz to 2.6nV/√ Hz. \nOnce the input differential voltage exceeds ±0.7V, steady state current conducted though the protection diodes should be limited to ±40mA. This implies 25Ω of protec -\ntion resistance per volt of continuous overdrive beyond ±0.7V. The input diodes are rugged enough to handle transient currents due to amplifier slew rate overdrive or momentary clipping without these resistors.\nFigure 2 shows the input and output waveforms of the \namplifier driven into clipping while connected in a gain of A\nV = 1. When the input signal goes sufficiently beyond \nthe power supply rails, the input transistors will saturate. When saturation occurs, the amplifier loses a stage of phase inversion and the output tries to change states. Diodes D1 and D2 forward bias and hold the output within \nOV\nFigure 2. V S = ±2.5V , A V = 1 with Large Overdrivea diode drop of the input signal. In this photo, the input signal generator is clipping at ±35mA, and the output transistors supply this generator current through the protection diodes.\nWith the amplifier connected in a gain of A\nV ≥ 2, the output \ncan invert with very heavy input overdrive. To avoid this \ninversion, limit the input overdrive to 0.5V beyond the power supply rails.\nESD\nThe L T6202/L T6203/L T6204 have reverse-biased ESD \nprotection diodes on all inputs and outputs as shown in Figure 1. If these pins are forced beyond either supply, unlimited current will flow through these diodes. If the current is transient and limited to one hundred milliamps or less, no damage to the device will occur .\nNoise\nThe noise voltage of the L T6202/L T6203/L T6204 is equiva -\nlent to that of a 225Ω resistor , and for the lowest possible \nnoise it is desirable to keep the source and feedback re -\nsistance at or below this value, i.e. R S + R G||RFB ≤ 225Ω.  \nWith R S + R G||RFB = 225Ω the total noise of the amplifier \nis: e n = √(1.9nV)2+(1.9nV)2 = 2.7nV. Below this resis -\ntance value, the amplifier dominates the noise, but in the resistance region between 225Ω and approximately 10kΩ, the noise is dominated by the resistor thermal noise. As the total resistance is further increased, beyond 10k, the noise current multiplied by the total resistance eventually dominates the noise.\nThe product of e\nn • √ISUPPL Y  is an interesting way to gauge \nlow noise amplifiers. Many low noise amplifiers with low e n \nhave high I SUPPL Y  current. In applications that require low \nnoise with the lowest possible supply current, this product \ncan prove to be enlightening. The L T6202/L T6203/L T6204 have an e\nn, √ISUPPL Y  product of 3.2 per amplifier , yet it is \ncommon to see amplifiers with similar noise specifications have an e\nn • √I SUPPL Y product of 4.7 to 13.5.\nFor a complete discussion of amplifier noise, see the L T1028 data sheet.\nLT6202/LT6203/LT6204\n20\n620234fdTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nLow Noise, Low Power 1MΩ AC  \nPhotodiode T ransimpedance Amplifier\nFigure 3 shows the L T6202 applied as a transimpedance \namplifier (TIA). The L T6202 forces the BF862 ultralow-noise JFET source to 0V , with R3 ensuring that the JFET has an I\nDRAIN  of 1mA. The JFET acts as a source follower , buffering \nthe input of the L T6202 and making it suitable for the high impedance feedback elements R1 and R2. The BF862 has a minimum I\nDSS of 10mA and a pinchoff voltage between \n–0.3V and –1.2V . The JFET gate and the L T6202 output therefore sit at a point slightly higher than one pinchoff voltage below ground (typically about –0.6V). When the photodiode is illuminated, the current must come from the L T6202’s output through R1 and R2, as in a normal TIA. Amplifier input noise density and gain-bandwidth product were measured at 2.4nV/Hz and 100MHz, respectively. Note that because the JFET has a high g\nm, approximately \n1/80Ω, its attenuation looking into R3 is only about 2%. Gain-bandwidth product was measured at 100MHz and the closed-loop bandwidth using a 3pF photodiode was approximately 1.4MHz.\nPrecision Low Noise, Low Power , 1MΩ  \nPhotodiode T ransimpedance Amplifier\nFigure 4 shows the L T6202 applied as a transimpedance amplifier (TIA), very similar to that shown in Figure 3. In this case, however , the JFET is not allowed to dictate the DC-bias conditions. Rather than being grounded, the L T6202’s noninverting input is driven by the L TC2050 to the exact state necessary for zero JFET gate voltage. The noise performance is nearly identical to that of the circuit in Figure 3, with the additional benefit of excellent DC per -\nformance. Input offset was measured at under 200µV and output noise was within 2mV\nP-P over a 20MHz bandwidth.\n–+VBIAS–PHILIPS\nBF862R1\n499kR2\n499k\nC1\n1pF\nVS–VS+\nVOUT\nVS = ±5VL T6202\nR3\n4.99k\nL T6202/03/04 F03\nFigure 3.

The bottom half of the L T6203 is in a gain-of-one configuration and buffers the 0V nega -\ntive full-scale signal V\nLOW into the negative input of the \nL TC1864. The top half of the L T6203 is in a gain-of-ten configuration referenced to the buffered voltage V\nLOW and \ndrives the positive  input of the L TC1864. The input range of the L TC1864 is 0V to 5V , but for best results the input range of V\nIN should be from V LOW (about 0.4V) to about \n0.82V . Figure 6 shows an FFT obtained with a 10.1318kHz coherent input waveform, from 8192 samples with no windowing or averaging. Spurious free dynamic range is seen to be about 100dB.Although the L TC1864 has a sample rate far below the gain bandwidth of the L T6203, using this amplifier is not necessarily a case of overkill. The designer is reminded that A/D converters have sample apertures that are vanishingly small (ideally, infinitesimally small) and make demands on the upstream circuitry far in excess of what is implied by the innocent-looking sample rate. In addition, when an A/D converter takes a sample, it applies a small capacitor to its inputs with a fair amount of glitch energy and expects the voltage on the capacitor to settle to the true value very quickly. Finally, the L TC1864 has a 20MHz analog input bandwidth and can be used in undersampling applications, again requiring a source bandwidth higher than Nyquist.\n–+\n–+–+L TC1864\n16-BIT\n250ksps5V\nSERIAL\nDATAOUTC1\n470pFR3\n100/uni03A9\nR4\n100/uni03A9R1\n1k\nR2\n110/uni03A9V\nIN = 0.6V DC\n±200mV AC\nVLOW = 0.4V DC1/2 L T6203\n1/2 L T6203\nL T6202/03/04 F05\nFigure 5.
