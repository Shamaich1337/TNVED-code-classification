In appli cations that use a \nfraction of  or use the entire input dynamic range and require \nlow distortion, the AD8027/ AD8028 are ideal choices.  \nMany rail -to-rail input amplifiers have an input stage that  switches \nfrom one differential pair to another as the input signal crosses \na threshold voltage, which causes distortion. The  AD8027 /AD8028 \nhave a unique feature that allows the user to  select the input \ncrossover threshold voltage through the DISABLE /SELECT pin  \n(DISABLE /SELECT  x in the 10 -lead MSOP , hereafter referred \nto as DISABLE /SELECT throughout this data sheet) . This  feature \ncontrols the voltage at which the complementary transistor \ninput pairs switch. The AD8027/ AD8028 also have intrinsically \nlow crossover distortion.  \n1 Protected by U.S. patent numbers 6,486,737B1; 6,518,842B1.  \n PIN CONNECTION DIAGRAM  \n \nFigure 1. 8-Lead SOIC,  AD8027   \nSee the Pin Configurations and Function Descriptions  section \nfor additional pin configurations and information about the pin functions.  \n \n \n \n \nWith their wide supply voltage range (2.7 V to 12 V) and wide \nbandwidth (190 MHz), the AD8027/ AD8028 amplifiers are \ndesigned to work in a variety of applications where speed and performance are needed on low supply voltages. The hi gh per -\nformance of the AD8027/ AD8028 is achieved with a quiescent \ncurrent of only 6.5 mA  (typical ) per amplifier. The AD8027/  \nAD8028 have a shutdown mode that is controlled via \nthe \nDISABLE /SELECT pin. \nThe AD8027/ AD8028 are available in 8-lead SOIC, 6-lead SOT -23, \nand 10-lead MSOP packages. The AD8028W ARMZ -R7 is an \nautomotive grade version, qualified for automotive applications. See the Automotive Products  section for more details. The \nAD8027/ AD8028 family is designe d to work over the extended  \ntemperature range of − 40°C to +125°C.  \n \nFigure 2. SFDR vs. Output Voltag e DNC = DO NOT CONNEC T.

Even temporarily exceeding this temperature limit may change the stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently \nshifting the parametric performance of the AD8027/ AD8028. \nExceeding  a junction temperature of 175°C for an extended \nperiod of time can result in changes in the silicon device s, \npotentially causing failure.  \nThe still air thermal properties of the package and PCB (θ\nJA), \nambient temperature (TA), and the total power dissipat ed in the \npackage (PD) determine the junction temperature of the die. \nThe junction temperature can be calculated as  \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA)  \nThe power dissipated in the package (PD) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the  \npackage due to the load drive for all outputs. The quiescent power is the voltage between the supply pins (V\nS) times the \nquiescent current (IS). Assuming the load (RL) is referenced to \nmidsupply,  the total drive power is VS/2 × IOUT, some of which is \ndissipated in the package and some in the load (VOUT × IOUT). \nThe difference between the total drive power and the load power is the drive p ower dissipated in the package.  \nP\nD = Quiescent Power  + (Total Drive Power  − Load Power ) \n()\nLOUT\nLOUT S\nS S DRV\nRV VI V P2\n–2\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb×+×=  It is recommended that rms output voltages  be considered. If RL \nis referenced to –VS, as in single -supply operation, the total \ndrive power is VS × IOUT. \nIf the rms signa l levels are indeterminate,  consider the worst \ncase, when VOUT = VS/4 for RL to midsupply.  \n()()\nLS\nS S DRVI V P24/+×=  \nIn single -supply operation with RL referenced to – VS, worst case \nis VOUT = VS/2. \nAirflow increases heat dissipation, effectively reducing θJA. Also , \nmore metal directly in contact with the package leads from \nmetal traces, through holes, ground, and power planes reduces \nthe θJA. Care must be taken to minimize parasitic capacitances \nat the input leads of high speed op amps, as described  in the  \nPCB Layout  section.  \nFigure 3 shows the maximum safe power dissipation in the \npackage vs. the ambient temperature for the 8 -lead SOIC  \n(125°C/W), 6-lead SOT -23 (170°C/W), and 10- lead MSOP  \n(130°C/W) packages on a JEDEC stan dard 4 -layer board.  \nOutput Short Circuit  \nShorting the output to ground or drawing excessive current \nfrom the AD8027/ AD8028 can cause catastrophic failure.  \n \nFigure 3.

D | Page 20 of 27 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD8027 /AD8028 are rail-to-rail input/output amplifiers \ndesigned in the Analog Devices, Inc., extra fast complementary \nbipolar (XFCB) process. The XFCB process enables the AD8027/ AD8028  to run on 2.7 V to 12 V supplies with 190 MHz \nof bandwidth and a 100 V/μs slew rate. The AD8027/ AD8028 \nhave 4.3 nV/√Hz of wideband noise with 17 nV/√Hz noise at 10 Hz. This noise performance, with an offset of less than 900 μV maximum and drift performance of 1.50 μV/°C typical, makes the AD8027/ AD8028 ideal for high speed, precision \napplications. Additionally, the input stage operates 200 mV beyond the supply rails and shows no phase reversal. The amplifiers feature overvoltage protection on the input stage. When the inputs exceed the supply rails by 0.7 V , ESD protection diodes turn on, drawing excessive current through the differen-tial input pins. Include a series input resistor to limit the input current to less than 10 mA. \nINPUT STAGE \nThe rail-to-rail input performance is achieved by operating \ncomplementary input pairs. The common-mode level of the \ndifferential input signal determines which pair is on. As shown in Figure 60, a tail current (I\nTAIL) is generated that sources the \nPNP differential input structure consisting of Q1 and Q2. A reference voltage is generated internally that is connected to the \nbase of Q5. This voltage is continually compared against the \ncommon-mode input voltage. When the common-mode level exceeds the internal reference voltage, Q5 diverts the tail current (I\nTAIL) from the PNP input pair to a current mirror that \nsources the NPN input pair consisting of Q3 and Q4. The NPN input pair can then operate at 200 mV above the positive rail. Both input pairs are protected from differential input signals above 1.4 V by four diodes across the input (see Figure 60). In the event of differential input signals that exceed \n1.4 V , the diodes conduct and excessive current flows through \nthem. Include a series input resistor to limit the input current to \n10 mA. \nCROSSOVER SELECTION \nThe AD8027 /AD8028 have a crossover selection feature that \nallows the user to choose the crossover point between the \nPNP/NPN differential pairs. Although the crossover region is small, avoid operating in this region because it can introduce offset and distortion to the output signal. To help avoid operat-\ning in the crossover region, the AD8027/ AD8028 allow the user \nto select from two preset crossover locations (voltage levels) \nusing the DISABLE\n/SELECT pin. The crossover region is about \n200 mV and is defined by the voltage level at the base of Q5 in \nFigure 60. Internally, two separate voltage sources are created approximately 1.2 V from either rail. One rail or the other is \nconnected to Q5, based on the voltage applied to the DISABLE\n/ \nSELECT pin. This allows either dominant PNP pair operation, \nwhen the DISABLE /SELECT pin is left open, or dominant NPN \npair operation, when the DISABLE /SELECT pin is pulled high. \nThe DISABLE /SELECT pin also provides the traditional power-\ndown function when it is pulled low. This pin allows the designer \nto achieve the best precision and ac performance for high-side and low-side signal applications. See Figure 54 through Figure 57 \nfor DISABLE\n/SELECT pin characteristics. \n \nFigure 60.

D | Page 21 of 27 In the event that the crossover region cannot be avoided, spe -\ncific attention is  given to the input stage to ensure constant \ntransconductance and minimal offset in all regions of  operation. \nThe regions are PNP input pair running, NPN input pair \nrunning, and both running at the same time (in the 200 mV crossover region). Maintaining constant transconductance in \nall regions ensures the best wideband distortion performance \nwhen going between these regions. With this technique, the AD8027/ AD8028 can typically achieve 85 dBc SFDR for a \n2 V p-p, 1 MHz, and G = + 1 signal on ±1.5 V supplies. Another \nrequirement needed to achieve this level of distortion is that the offset of each pair must be laser trimmed , even for low  frequency \nsignals.  \nOUTPUT STAGE  \nThe AD8027/ AD8028 use a common emitter output structure \nto achieve rail -to-rail output capability. The output stage is \ndesigned to drive 50 mA of linear output current, 40 mA within 200 mV of the rail, and 2.5 mA within 35 mV of the rail. Loading of the output stage, including any possi ble feedback \nnetwork, lowers the open -loop gain of the amplifier. Refer to \nFigure 53 for the loading behavior. Capacitive load can degrade \nthe phase marg in of the amplifier. The AD8027/ AD8028 can \ndrive up to 20 pF, G = + 1, as shown in Figure 14. Include a  \nsmall (25 Ω to 50 Ω) series resistor, R\nSNUB, if the capacitive load \nis to exceed 20  pF for a gain of 1. Increasing the closed -loop \ngain increases the amount of capacitive load  that can be driven \nbefore a series resistor must  be included.  \nDC ERRORS  \nThe AD8027/ AD8028 use two complementary input stages to \nachieve rail -to-rail input performance, as described  in the Input \nStage  section. To use the dc performance over the entire common -\nmode range, the inpu t bias current and input offset voltage o f \neach pair must be considered.  \nReferring to Figure 61, the output offset voltage of each pair is \ncalculated by  \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+=\nGF G\nPNPOS OUT PNPOSRR RV V, , ,\n \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+=\nGF G\nNPNOS OUT NPNOSRR RV V, , ,\n \nwhere the difference of the two input stages is the discontinuity \nexperienced when goin g through the crossover region.  \n \n The size of the discontinuity is defined as  \n( )\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+×−=\nGF G\nNPNOS, PNPOS, DISRR RV V V  \nUsing the crossover s elect feature of the AD8027/ AD8028 helps \nto avoid this region. In the event that the region cannot be \navoided, the quantity ( VOS, PNP  − VOS, NPN ) is t rimmed to \nminimize this effect.  \nBecause the input pairs are complementary, the input bias cur -\nrent reverses polarity when going through the crossover region shown in Figure 41. The offset between pairs is described by  \n( )\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n−\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+×−=−F\nGF G\nS NPNB, PNPB, NPNOS, PNPOS, R\nRR RR I I V V  \nwhere:  \nIB, PNP is the input bias current of either input when the PNP \ninput pair is active . \nIB, NPN  is the input bias current o f either input pair when the \nNPN pair is active.  \nIf RS is sized so that it equals RF when multiplied by the gain \nfactor , this effect is eliminated. It is strongly recommended to \nbalance the imped ances in this manner when traveling through \nthe crossover r egion to minimize the dc error and distortion. As \nan example, assuming that the PNP input pair has an input bias \ncurrent of 6  µA and the NPN input pair has an input bias \ncurrent of − 2 µA, a 200 µV shift in offset occurs when traveling \nthrough the crossover  region with RF equal to 0 Ω and RS equal \nto 25 Ω.  \nIn addition to the input bias current shift between pairs, each input pair has an input bias current offset that contributes to the total offset in the following manner:  \nF B\nGF G\nS B OS RIRR RRI V− + −\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+=F  \n \nFigure 61.

D | Page 22 of 27 WIDEBAND OPERATION \nVoltage feedback amplifiers can use a wide range of resistor \nvalues to set their gain. Proper design of the feedback network \nof the application requires consideration of the following issues: \n\uf0b7 Poles formed by the amplifier input capacitances with the \nresistances seen at the amplifier input terminals \n\uf0b7 Effects of mismatched source impedances \n\uf0b7 Resistor value impact on the voltage noise of the application \n\uf0b7 Amplifier loading effects \nThe AD8027 /AD8028 have an input capacitance of 2 pF. This \ninput capacitance forms a pole with the amplifier feedback \nnetwork, destabilizing the loop. For this reason, it is generally \ndesirable to keep the source resistances below 500 Ω, unless some capacitance is included in the feedback network. Likewise, keeping the source resistances low also takes advantage of the \nAD8027/ AD8028  low input voltage noise of 4.3 nV/√Hz. \nWith a wide bandwidth of 190 MHz, the AD8027 /AD8028 have \nnumerous applications and configurations. The AD8027/ AD8028 \ndevice shown in Figure 62 is configured as a noninverting ampli-\nfier. Table 9 provides an easy selection table of gain, resistor values, bandwidth, and noise performance, and Figure 63 shows \nthe inverting configuration. \n \nFigure 62. Wideband Noninv erting Gain Configuration  \nFigure 63. Wideband Inverting Gain Configuration \nCIRCUIT CONSIDERATIONS \nBalanced Input Impedances \nBalanced input impedances can help to improve distortion \nperformance. When the amplifier transitions from PNP pair \nto NPN pair operation, a change in both the magnitude and direction of the input bias current occurs. When multiplied by imbalanced input impedances, a change in offset can result. The key to minimizing this distortion is to keep the input impedances \nbalanced on both inputs. Figure 64 shows the effect of the \nimbalance and degradation in SFDR performance for a 50 Ω source impedance, with and without a 50 Ω balanced feedback \npath. \n \nFigure 64.

D | Page 23 of 27 PCB Layout  \nAs with all high speed op amps, achieving optimum perform -\nance from the AD8027/ AD8028 requires careful attention to \nPCB layout. Particular care must be exercised to minimize lead \nlengths of the bypass capacitors. Excess lead inductance can \ninfluence the frequency response and even cause high fre-quency oscillations. The use of a multilayer board with an internal ground plane can reduce ground noise and enable a tighter layout.  \nTo achieve the shortest possible lead length at the inverting input , position  the feedback resistor, R\nF, beneath the board so \nthat it span s the distance from the output, to the inverting \ninput . Situate t he return node of the resistor, RG, as closely as \npossible to the return node  of the negative supply bypass \ncapacitor . \nOn multilayer boards, clear all layers underneath the op amp of \nmetal to avoid creating parasitic capacitive elements. This is especially true at the summing junction (the  negative input ). \nExtra capacitance at the summing junction can cause increased \npeaking in the frequency response and lower phase margin.  \nGrounding  \nTo minimize parasitic inductances and ground loops in high \nspeed, densely populated boards, a ground plane layer is critical. Understanding where the c urrent flows in a circuit is critical in \nthe implementation of high speed circuit design. The length of \nthe current path is directly proportional to the magnitude of the \nparasitic inductances and, therefore, the high frequency imped -\nance of the path. Fast current changes in an inductive ground return can create unwanted noise and ringing.  The length of the high frequency bypass capacitor pads and \ntraces is critical. A parasitic inductance in the bypass grounding \nworks against the low impedance created by th e bypass  capacitor. \nBecause load currents flow from supplies as well as ground, place the load at the same physical location as the bypass  capacitor \nground. For large values of capacitors, which are intended to be effective at lower frequencies, the curren t return path length is \nless critical.  \nPower Supply Bypassing  \nPower supply pins are actually inputs, and care must be taken to \nprovide a clean, low noise, dc voltage source to these inputs. The bypass  capacitors have two functions.  \n• Provide a low impedance path for unwanted frequencies \nfrom the supply inputs to ground, thereby reducing the effect of noise on the supply lines.  \n• Provide sufficient localized charge storage, for fast switching conditions and minimizing the voltage drop at the supply pins and the output of the amplifier. This is usually accom plished with larger electrolytic capacitors.  \nDecoupling methods are designed to minimize the bypassing impedance at all frequencies. This can be accomplished with a combination of ca pacitors in parallel to gro und.  \nUse high quality ceramic chip capacitors and always keep  them \nas close as po ssible to the amplifier package . A parallel combina -\ntion of a 0.01 µF ceramic and a 10 µF electrolytic covers a wide range of rejection for unwanted noise. The 10  µF capacitor  is \nless critical for high frequency bypassing, and, in most cases, one per supply line is sufficient.  \n \n \nAD8027/AD8028  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 24 of 27 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nUSING THE DISABLE /SELECT  PIN \nThe AD8027/ AD8028 unique DISABLE /SELECT  pin has two \nfunctions:  \n• The power -down function places the AD8027/ AD8028 \ninto low power consumption mode. In power -down mode, \nthe amplifiers draw 500  µA max imum of supply current.  \n• The second function, as described  in the Crossover \nSelection  section , shifts the crossover point (where the \nNPN/PNP input differential pairs transition from one to \nthe other) closer to either the positive supply rail or the negative supply rail. This selectable crossover point allows the user to minimize distortion based on the input signal \nand environ ment. The default state is − 1.2 V from the \npositive power supply, with the \nDISABLE /SELECT  pin l eft \nfloating or in tristate mode. In tristate mode , it is important \nthat current to the pin is limited to ± 20 μA maximum .  \nTable 10 lists the voltage levels  and modes  of operation for  \nthe DISABLE /SELECT pin over the full temperature range. \nTable 10.
