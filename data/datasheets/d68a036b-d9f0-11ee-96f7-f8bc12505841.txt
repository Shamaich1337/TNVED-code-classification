The control loop is internally compensated.\nThe regulation network achieves fast and stable operation with small external components and low-ESR ceramic \noutput capacitors. The devices can be operated without a feedforward capacitor on the output voltage divider, \nhowever, using a typically 10-pF feedforward capacitor improves transient response.\nThe devices support forced fixed frequency PWM operation with the MODE pin tied to a logic high level. The \nfrequency is defined as 2.25 MHz internally fixed. Alternatively, the devices can be synchronized to an external \nclock signal in a range from 1.8 MHz to 4 MHz, applied to the MODE pin with no need for additional passive \ncomponents. An internal PLL allows you to change from internal clock to external clock during operation. The \nsynchronization to the external clock is done on a falling edge of the clock applied at MODE to the rising edge \non the SW pin. This allows a roughly 180° phase shift when the SW pin is used to generate the synchronization \nsignal for a second converter. When the MODE pin is set to a logic low level, the device operates in power save \nmode (PFM) at low output current and automatically transfers to fixed frequency PWM mode at higher output \ncurrent. In PFM mode, the switching frequency decreases linearly based on the load to sustain high efficiency \ndown to very low output current.\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\n+\n-GND\nFBSW VIN\nENOscillatorGate Drive and Control\nDevice\nControlPG\nThermal\n ShutdownBias\nRegulator\ngmIpeak Izero\nBandgap\nSS/TRMODE\n9.3 Feature Description\n9.3.1 Precise Enable (EN)\nThe voltage applied at the enable pin of the TPS62851x  is compared to a fixed threshold of 1.1 V for a rising \nvoltage. This allows you to drive the pin by a slowly changing voltage and enables the use of an external RC \nnetwork to achieve a power-up delay.\nThe Precise Enable input provides a user-programmable undervoltage lockout by adding a resistor divider to the \ninput of the Enable pin.\nThe enable input threshold for a falling edge is typically 100 mV lower than the rising edge threshold. The \nTPS62851x  starts operation when the rising threshold is exceeded. For proper operation, the enable (EN) pin \nmust be terminated and must not be left floating. Pulling the enable pin low forces the device into shutdown, with TPS628510, TPS628511, TPS628512, TPS628513\nSLUSDO4B – AUGUST 2020 – REVISED JUNE 2022 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS628510  TPS628511  TPS628512  TPS628513\na shutdown current of typically 1 μA. In this mode, the internal high-side and low-side MOSFETs are turned off \nand the entire internal control circuitry is switched off.\n9.3.2 MODE / SYNC\nWhen MODE/SYNC is set low, the device operates in PWM or PFM mode, depending on the output current. The \nMODE/SYNC pin allows you to force PWM mode when set high. The pin also allows you to apply an external \nclock in a frequency range from 1.8 MHz to 4 MHz for external synchronization. The specifications for the \nminimum on-time and minimum off-time have to be observed when setting the external frequency. The external \nclock must be set to about 2.25 MHz initially and then increased or decreased to the desired frequency. This \nensures a low distortion of the output voltage when the external frequency is applied.\n9.3.3 Spread Spectrum Clocking (SSC)\nIf interested in this option, please contact Texas Instruments.  The device offers spread spectrum clocking as an \noption. When SSC is enabled, the switching frequency is randomly changed in PWM mode when the internal \nclock is used. The frequency variation is typically between the nominal switching frequency and up to 288 kHz \nabove the nominal switching frequency. When the device is externally synchronized by applying a clock signal to \nthe MODE/SYNC pin, the TPS62851x  follows the external clock and the internal spread spectrum block is turned \noff. SSC is also disabled during soft start.\n9.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nIf the input voltage drops, the undervoltage lockout prevents misoperation of the device by switching off both the \npower FETs. When enabled, the device is fully operational for input voltages above the rising UVLO threshold \nand turns off if the input voltage trips below the threshold for a falling supply voltage.\n9.3.5 Power Good Output (PG)\nPower good is an open-drain output that requires a pullup resistor to any voltage up to the recommended input \nvoltage level. It is driven by a window comparator. PG is held low when the device is disabled, in undervoltage \nlockout in thermal shutdown, and not in soft start. When the output voltage is in regulation hence, within the \nwindow defined in the electrical characteristics, the output is high impedance.\nVIN must remain present for the PG pin to stay low. If the power good output is not used, it is recommended to tie \nto GND or leave open. The PG indicator features a de-glitch, as specified in the electrical characteristics, for the \ntransition from "high impedance" to "low" of its output.\nTable 9-1. PG Status\nEN DEVICE STATUS PG STATE\nX VIN < 2 V undefined\nlow VIN ≥ 2 V low\nhigh2 V ≤ V IN ≤ UVLO OR in thermal shutdown OR V OUT not in regulation \nOR device in soft startlow\nhigh VOUT in regulation high impedance\n9.3.6 Thermal Shutdown\nThe junction temperature (T J) of the device is monitored by an internal temperature sensor. If T J exceeds 170°C \n(typ), the device goes into thermal shutdown. Both the high-side and low-side power FETs are turned off and \nPG goes low. When T J decreases below the hysteresis amount of typically 15°C, the converter resumes normal \noperation, beginning with soft start. During a PFM pause, the thermal shutdown is not active. After a PFM pause, \nthe device needs up to 9 µs to detect a junction temperature that is too high. If the PFM burst is shorter than this \ndelay, the device does not detect a junction temperature that is too high.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\n9.4.1 Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Operation\nThe TPS62851x  has two operating modes: forced PWM mode, which is discussed in this section, and \nPWM/PFM as discussed in Section 9.4.2 .www.ti.comTPS628510, TPS628511, TPS628512, TPS628513\nSLUSDO4B – AUGUST 2020 – REVISED JUNE 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS628510  TPS628511  TPS628512  TPS628513\nWith the MODE/SYNC pin set to high, the TPS62851x  operates with pulse width modulation in continuous \nconduction mode (CCM). The switching frequency is 2.25 MHz or defined  by an external clock signal applied \nto the MODE/SYNC pin. With an external clock applied to MODE/SYNC, the TPS62851x  follow the frequency \napplied to the pin. In general, the frequency range in forced PWM mode is 1.8 MHz to 4 MHz. However, the \nfrequency needs to be in a range the TPS62851x  can operate at, taking the minimum on-time into account.\n9.4.2 Power Save Mode Operation (PWM/PFM)\nWhen the MODE/SYNC pin is low, power save mode is allowed. The device operates in PWM mode as long \nas the peak inductor current is above the PFM threshold of about 0.8 A. When the peak inductor current \ndrops below the PFM threshold, the device starts to skip switching pulses. In power save mode, the switching \nfrequency decreases with the load current maintaining high efficiency.\n9.4.3 100% Duty-Cycle Operation\nThe duty cycle of a buck converter operated in PWM mode is given as D = VOUT / VIN. The duty cycle \nincreases as the input voltage comes close to the output voltage and the off-time gets smaller. When the \nminimum off-time of typically 10 ns is reached, the TPS62851x  skips switching cycles while it approaches \n100% mode. In 100% mode, it keeps the high-side switch on continuously. The high-side switch stays turned \non as long as the output voltage is below the target. In 100% mode, the low-side switch is turned off. The \nmaximum dropout voltage in 100% mode is the product of the on-resistance of the high-side switch plus the \nseries resistance of the inductor and the load current.\n9.4.4 Current Limit and Short Circuit Protection\nThe TPS62851x is  protected against overload and short circuit events. If the inductor current exceeds the \ncurrent limit I LIMH, the high-side switch is turned off and the low-side switch is turned on to ramp down the \ninductor current. The high-side switch turns on again only if the current in the low side-switch has decreased \nbelow the low side current limit. Due to internal propagation delay, the actual current can exceed the static \ncurrent limit. The dynamic current limit is given as:\n( )L\npeak typ LIMH PDVI I tL/c61 /c43 /c215\n(1)\nwhere\n•ILIMH is the static current limit as specified in the electrical characteristics\n•L is the effective inductance at the peak current\n•VL is the voltage across the inductor (V IN - VOUT)\n•tPD is the internal propagation delay of typically 50 ns\nThe current limit can exceed static values, especially if the input voltage is high and very small inductances are \nused. The dynamic high-side switch peak current can be calculated as follows:\n( ) 50IN OUT\npeak typ LIMHV VI I nsL/c45/c61 /c43 /c215\n(2)\n9.4.5 Foldback Current Limit and Short Circuit Protection\nThis is valid for devices where foldback current limit is enabled. If interested in this option, please contact Texas \nInstruments.\nWhen the device detects current limit for more than 1024 subsequent switching cycles, it reduces the current \nlimit from its nominal value to typically 1.3 A. Foldback current limit is left when the current limit indication goes \naway. If device operation continues in current limit, it would, after 3072 switching cycles, try for full current limit \nagain for 1024 switching cycles.\n9.4.6 Output Discharge\nThe purpose of the discharge function is to ensure a defined down-ramp of the output voltage when the device is \nbeing disabled and to keep the output voltage close to 0 V when the device is off. The output discharge feature TPS628510, TPS628511, TPS628512, TPS628513\nSLUSDO4B – AUGUST 2020 – REVISED JUNE 2022 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS628510  TPS628511  TPS628512  TPS628513\nis only active once the TPS62851x  have been enabled at least once since the supply voltage was applied. \nThe discharge function is enabled as soon as the device is disabled, in thermal shutdown, or in undervoltage \nlockout. The minimum supply voltage required for the discharge function to remain active typically is 2 V. Output \ndischarge is not activated during a current limit or foldback current limit event.\n9.4.7 Soft Start / Tracking (SS/TR)\nThe internal soft-start circuitry controls the output voltage slope during start-up. This avoids excessive inrush \ncurrent and ensures a controlled output voltage rise time. It also prevents unwanted voltage drops from high \nimpedance power sources or batteries. When EN is set high to start operation, the device starts switching after \na delay of about 200 μs, then the internal reference and hence V OUT rises with a slope controlled by an external \ncapacitor connected to the SS/TR pin.\nLeaving the SS/TR pin un-connected provides the fastest start-up ramp with 160 µs typically. A capacitor \nconnected from SS/TR to GND is charged with 2.5 µA by an internal current source during soft start until it \nreaches the reference voltage of 0.6 V. The capacitance required to set a certain ramp-time (t ramp) therefore is:\n(3)\nIf the device is set to shutdown (EN = GND), undervoltage lockout, or thermal shutdown, an internal resistor \npulls the SS/TR pin to GND to ensure a proper low level. Returning from those states causes a new start-up \nsequence.\nA voltage applied at SS/TR can be used to track a master voltage. The output voltage follows this voltage in both \ndirections up and down in forced PWM mode. In PFM mode, the output voltage decreases based on the load \ncurrent. The SS/TR pin must not be connected to the SS/TR pin of other devices. The maximum value for C SS is \n47 nF to ensure proper discharge before the device starts to ramp the output voltage.\n9.4.8 Input Overvoltage Protection\nWhen the input voltage exceeds the absolute maximum rating, the device is set to PFM mode so it cannot \ntransfer energy from the output to the input.www.ti.comTPS628510, TPS628511, TPS628512, TPS628513\nSLUSDO4B – AUGUST 2020 – REVISED JUNE 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS628510  TPS628511  TPS628512  TPS628513\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n10.1 Application Information\n10.1.1 Programming the Output Voltage\nThe output voltage of the TPS62851x  is adjustable. It can be programmed for output voltages from 0.6 V to 5.5 \nV using a resistor divider from VOUT to GND. The voltage at the FB pin is regulated to 600 mV. The value of \nthe output voltage is set by the selection of the resistor divider from Equation 6 . It is recommended to choose \nresistor values that allow a current of at least 2 µA, meaning the value of R 2 must not exceed 400 k Ω. Lower \nresistor values are recommended for highest accuracy and most robust design.\n1 2 1OUT\nFBVR RV/c215/c230 /c246/c61 /c45 /c231 /c247/c232 /c248\n(4)\n10.1.2 Inductor Selection\nThe TPS62851x  is designed for a nominal 0.47-µH inductor with a switching frequency of typically 2.25 MHz. \nLarger values can be used to achieve a lower inductor current ripple but they can have a negative impact on \nefficiency and transient response. Smaller values than 0.47 µH cause a larger inductor current ripple which \ncauses larger negative inductor current in forced PWM mode at low or no output current. For a higher or lower \nnominal switching frequency, the inductance must be changed accordingly. See Section 7.3 for details.\nThe inductor selection is affected by several effects like inductor ripple current, output ripple voltage, PWM-to-\nPFM transition point, and efficiency. In addition, the inductor selected has to be rated for appropriate saturation \ncurrent and DC resistance (DCR). Equation 5  calculates the maximum inductor current.\n2(max)\n(max) (max)L\nOUT LII I/c68/c43 /c61\n(5)\n(max)11\nminOUT\nOUT\nIN\nL\nSWVVVIL f/c215/c230 /c246/c45/c231 /c247/c232 /c248/c68 /c61 /c215\n(6)\nwhere\n•IL(max)  is the maximum inductor current\n•ΔIL(max)  is the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current\n•Lmin is the minimum inductance at the operating pointTPS628510, TPS628511, TPS628512, TPS628513\nSLUSDO4B – AUGUST 2020 – REVISED JUNE 2022 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS628510  TPS628511  TPS628512  TPS628513\nTable 10-1.

A margin of about 20% is recommended to add. A larger inductor value is also \nuseful to get lower ripple current, but increases the transient response time and size as well.\n10.1.3 Capacitor Selection\n10.1.3.1 Input Capacitor\nFor most applications, 10-µF nominal is sufficient and is recommended. The input capacitor buffers the input \nvoltage for transient events and also decouples the converter from the supply. A low-ESR multilayer ceramic \ncapacitor (MLCC) is recommended for best filtering and must be placed between VIN and GND as close as \npossible to those pins.\n10.1.3.2 Output Capacitor\nThe architecture of the TPS62851x  allows the use of tiny ceramic output capacitors with low equivalent series \nresistance (ESR). These capacitors provide low output voltage ripple and are recommended. To keep its low \nresistance up to high frequencies and to get narrow capacitance variation with temperature, it is recommended \nto use X7R or X5R dielectric. Using a higher value has advantages like smaller voltage ripple and a tighter DC \noutput accuracy in power save mode.\n10.2 Typical Application\nL\n0.47PH\nMODE/SYNCSW\nFBVINV\n2.7 V - 6 VIN TPS62851x\nENR1VOUT\nR2\nGNDPG  SS/TRR3CFF\n2*10 PF0603\n0603CIN\n2*10 PF\nCOUTCSS\nFigure 10-1.

Start-Up Timing\n10.3 System Examples\n10.3.1 Voltage Tracking\nThe TPS62851x follows the voltage applied to the SS/TR pin. A voltage ramp on SS/TR to 0.6 V ramps the \noutput voltage according to the 0.6-V feedback voltage.\nTracking the 3.3 V of device 1, so that both rails reach their target voltage at the same time, requires a resistor \ndivider on SS/TR of device 2 equal to the output voltage divider of device 1. The output current of 2.5 µA on the \nSS/TR pin causes an offset voltage on the resistor divider formed by R 5 and R 6. The equivalent resistance of \nR5 // R 6 must be kept below 15 k Ω. The current from SS/TR causes a slightly higher voltage across R6 than 0.6 \nV, which is desired because device 2 switches to its internal reference as soon as the voltage at SS/TR is higher \nthan 0.6 V.\nIn case both devices need to run in forced PWM mode, it is recommended to tie the MODE pin of device 2 to the \noutput voltage or the power good signal of device 1, the master device. The TPS6281x does have a duty cycle \nlimitation defined by the minimum on-time. For tracking down to low output voltages, device 2 cannot follow once \nthe minimum duty cycle is reached. Enabling PFM mode while tracking is in progress allows the user to ramp \ndown the output voltage close to 0 V.TPS628510, TPS628511, TPS628512, TPS628513\nSLUSDO4B – AUGUST 2020 – REVISED JUNE 2022 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS628510  TPS628511  TPS628512  TPS628513\nL\nMODE/SYNCSW\nFBVINV\n2.7 V - 6 VIN\n2*10 μFTPS62851x\nEN3.3 V\nGNDPGSS/TR\n22 nF10 pF\nL\nMODE/SYNCSW\nFBVIN\n2*10 μFTPS62851x\nEN\nR51.8 V\nR6\nGNDPGSS/TR10 pFDevice 1 (Primary)\nDevice 2 (Secondary)EN\n0.47 μH0.47 μH\n0603\n06030603\n0603CIN\nCIN\nCOUTCOUT2*10 μF\n2*10 μF\nFigure 10-57.

Therefore, the PCB layout of the TPS62851x  demands careful attention to ensure operation and to \nget the performance specified. A poor layout can lead to issues like the following:\n•Poor regulation (both in Section 12.2 and load)\n•Stability and accuracy weaknesses\n•Increased EMI radiation\n•Noise sensitivity\nSee Figure 12-1  for the recommended layout of the TPS62851x , which is designed for common external ground \nconnections. The input capacitor must be placed as close as possible between the VIN and GND pin.\nProvide low inductive and resistive paths for loops with high di/dt. Therefore, paths conducting the switched load \ncurrent must be as short and wide as possible. Provide low capacitive paths (with respect to all other nodes) \nfor wires with high dv/dt. Therefore, the input and output capacitance must be placed as close as possible to \nthe IC pins and parallel wiring over long distances and narrow traces must be avoided. Loops which conduct \nan alternating current should outline an area as small as possible, as this area is proportional to the energy \nradiated.\nSensitive nodes like FB need to be connected with short wires and not nearby high dv/dt signals (for example, \nSW). As they carry information about the output voltage, they must be connected as close as possible to the \nactual output voltage (at the output capacitor). The capacitor on the SS/TR pin as well as the  FB resistors, R 1 \nand R 2, must be kept close to the IC and be connected directly to the pin and the system ground plane.\nThe package uses the pins for power dissipation. Thermal vias on the VIN and GND pins help to spread the heat \ninto the PCB.\nThe recommended layout is implemented on the EVM and shown in the TPS62851xEVM-139 Evaluation Module \nUser\'s Guide .\n12.2 Layout Example\nVR1V\nINOUT\nC\nCCC\nINOUT\nLff\nssGND\nGNDU1GNDSWPGFB\nVINENMODESSR2Solution size = 30mm2\nFigure 12-1.
