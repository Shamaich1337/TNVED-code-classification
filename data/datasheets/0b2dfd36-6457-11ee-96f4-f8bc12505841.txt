The devices \nsupply up to 1.5A of output current at a typical dropout voltage of 310mV. Operating quiescent current is typically 1.1mA and drops to < 1µA in shutdown. Quiescent current is also well controlled in dropout. In addition to fast tran -\nsient response, the L T3015 series exhibit very low output noise, making them ideal for noise sensitive applications.\nThe L T3015 regulators are stable with a minimum 10µF \noutput capacitor. Moreover, the regulator can use small ceramic capacitors without the necessary addition of ESR as is common with other regulators. Internal protection circuitry includes reverse output protection, precision cur -\nrent limit with foldback and thermal limit with hysteresis. \nThe L T3015 regulators are available in fixed output volt -\nages of –2.5V , –3V , –3.3V , –5V , –12V and –15V and as an \nadjustable device with a –1.22V reference voltage. Pack-ages include the 5-lead TO-220 and DD-Pak, a thermally enhanced 12-lead MSOP and the low profile (0.75 mm) 8-lead 3mm × 3mm DFN.\nL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks and \nThinSOT is a trademark of Linear Technology Corporation.

over the full operating \ntemperature range, otherwise specifications are at T A = 25°C.\nLT3015 Series\n6\n3015fbNote 1: Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings \nmay cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: The L T3015 adjustable version is tested and specified for these \nconditions with the ADJ pin connected to the OUT pin.\nNote 3: Maximum junction temperature limits operating conditions. The \nregulated output voltage specification does not apply for all possible combinations of input voltage and output current, especially due to the current limit foldback which starts to decrease current limit at about  \n|V\nIN\xa0– V OUT| = 8V . If operating at maximum output current, limit the input \nvoltage range. If operating at maximum input voltage, limit the output current range.\nNote 4: To satisfy minimum input voltage requirements, the L T3015 is \ntested and specified for these conditions with an external resistor divider (54.9k top, 49.9k bottom) for an output voltage of –2.56V . The external resistor adds 25μA of DC load on the output.\nNote 5: Dropout voltage is the minimum input-to-output voltage \ndifferential needed to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In dropout, the output voltage is: V\nIN + V DROPOUT .\nNote 6: GND pin current is tested with V IN = V OUT(NOMINAL)  and a current \nsource load. Therefore, the device is tested while operating in dropout. This is the worst-case GND pin current. GND pin current decreases slightly at higher input voltages.\nNote 7: Positive ADJ pin bias current flows into the ADJ pin.ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS The l denotes the specifications which apply over the full operating \ntemperature range, otherwise specifications are at T A = 25°C.\nNote 8: Positive SHDN pin current flows into the SHDN pin.Note 9: The L T3015 is tested and specified under pulsed load conditions \nsuch that T\nJ ≅ T A. The L T3015E is guaranteed to meet performance \nspecifications from 0°C to 125°C junction temperature. Specifications over the –40°C to 125°C operating temperature range are assured by design, characterization, and correlation with statistical process controls. The L T3015I is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. The L T3015MP is 100% tested and guaranteed over the full –55°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range.\nNote 10: Parasitic diodes exist internally between the OUT , ADJ, SHDN \npins and the IN pin. Do not drive the OUT , ADJ, and SHDN pins more that 0.3V below the IN pin during fault conditions, and these pins must remain at a voltage more positive than IN during normal operation.\nNote 11: The SHDN threshold must be met to ensure device operation.Note 12: For L T3015, the minimum input voltage refers to the lowest \ninput voltage before the parts goes out of regulation. For the fixed voltage versions of L T3015, the minimum input voltage refers to the lowest input voltage before the part can no longer sink 1.5A; for proper regulation, the dropout voltage requirements must be met.\nNote 13: Sense pin current flows out of the pin.Note 14: The current limit circuit incorporates foldback that decreases \ncurrent limit for |V\nIN – V OUT| ≥ 8V . Some level of output current is \nprovided at all V IN – V OUT differential voltages.

Exposed \nPad Pin 13 / 3, Tab / 3, Tab ):  Input. These pins supply \npower to the regulator. The Tab of the DD-Pak, TO-220 and the exposed backside pad of the DFN and MSOP packages  \nis an electrical connection to IN and to the device’s sub -\nstrate. For proper electrical and thermal performance, tie all IN pins together and tie IN to the exposed backside or Tab of the relevant package on the PCB. See the Applica -\ntions Information Section for thermal considerations and calculating junction temperature. The L T3015 requires a bypass capacitor at IN. In general, a battery’s output impedance rises with frequency, so include a bypass ca-pacitor in battery powered applications. An input bypass capacitor in the range of 1µF to 10µF generally suffices, but applications with large load transients may require higher input capacitance to prevent input supply droop and prevent the regulator from entering dropout.\nSHDN (Pin 3 / 5 / 1 / 1):  Shutdown. Use the SHDN pin to \nput the L T3015 into a micropower shutdown state. The \nSHDN function is bi-directional, allowing use of either positive or negative logic. The SHDN pin threshold volt -\nages are referenced to GND. The output of the L T3015 is OFF if the SHDN pin is pulled typically within ±0.73V of \nGND. Driving the SHDN pin typically more than ±1.21V \nturns the L T3015 ON. Drive the SHDN pin with either a \nlogic gate or with open collector/drain logic using a pull-up resistor. The resistor supplies the pull-up current of the open collector/drain gate, typically several microamperes. The typical SHDN pin current is 2.8µA out of the pin (for negative logic) or 17µA into the pin (for positive logic). If the SHDN function is unused, connect the SHDN pin to \nV\nIN to turn the device ON. If the SHDN pin is floated, then \nthe L T3015 is OFF . A parasitic diode exists between SHDN \nand IN of the L T3015. Therefore, do not drive the SHDN \npin more than 0.3V below IN during normal operation or during a fault condition. The SHDN pin can also be used \nto set a programmable undervoltage lockout (UVLO) threshold for the regulator input supply.\nGND (Pins 4, 5 / 6, 7 / 2 / 2):  Ground. Tie all GND pin(s) \ntogether and tie the bottom of the output voltage setting \nresistor divider directly to the GND pin(s) for optimum load regulation performance.\nADJ (Pin 6 / 8 / 4 / 4):  Adjust. For the adjustable voltage \nversion, this pin is the error amplifier’s non-inverting input. It has a typical bias current of 30nA that flows into the \npin. The ADJ pin reference voltage is –1.22V referred to GND, and the output voltage range is –1.22V to –29.5V. A parasitic substrate diode exists between ADJ and IN of the L T3015. Therefore, do not drive ADJ more than 0.3V below IN during normal operation or during a fault condition.\nSENSE (Pin 6 / 8 / 4 / 4):  Sense. For the fixed voltage ver -\nsions of the L T3015 (L T3015-2.5/L T3015-3/L T3015-3.3/\nL T3015-5/L T3015-12/L T3015-15), the SENSE pin connects to the non-inverting input of the error amplifier through an internal resistor divider network. Optimum regulation is obtained when the SENSE pin is connected to the OUT pin of the regulator . In critical applications, small voltage drops are caused by the resistance (R\nP) of PCB traces \nbetween the regulator and the load. These drops can be eliminated by connecting the SENSE pin to the output at the load as shown in Figure 1 (Kelvin Sense Connection). Note that the voltage drop across the external PCB traces will add to the dropout voltage of the regulator . The SENSE pin bias current is 100µA at the nominal output voltage. A parasitic diode exists between SENSE and IN of the L T3015. Therefore, do not drive SENSE more than 0.3V below IN during normal operation or during a fault condition.\nOUT (Pins 7, 8 / 9, 10, 11, 12 / 5 / 5): Output. These \npins supply power to the load. Tie all OUT pins together for best performance. Use a minimum output capacitor of 10µF with an ESR less than 500mΩ to prevent oscil -\nlations. Large load transient applications require larger output capacitors to limit peak voltage transients. See the Applications Information section for more information on output capacitance. A parasitic substrate diode exists between OUT and IN of the L T3015. Therefore, do not drive OUT more than 0.3V below IN during normal operation or during a fault condition.(DFN/MSOP/Q/T)\nFigure 1.

The device supplies up to 1.5A of output load current at a typical dropout voltage of 310mV. Moreover, the low 1.1mA operating quiescent current drops to less than 1µA in shutdown. In addition to low quiescent current, the L T3015 incorporates several protection features that make it ideal for battery powered applications. In dual supply applications where the regu -\nlator’s load is returned to a positive supply, OUT can be pulled above GND by 30V and still allow the L T3015 to start up and operate.\nAdjustable Operation\nThe L T3015 adjustable version has an output voltage \nrange of –1.22V to –29.3V. Output voltage is set by the ratio of two external resistors as shown in Figure 2. The device regulates the output to maintain the ADJ pin voltage to –1.22V referred to ground. The current in R1 equals –1.22V/R1 and the current in R2 equals the current in R1 plus the ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ pin bias current, 30nA at 25°C, flows into the ADJ pin. Calculate the output voltage using the formula shown in Figure 1. The value of R1 should be less than 50k to minimize errors in the output voltage created by the ADJ pin bias current. Note that in shutdown, the output is off and the divider current APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nis zero. Curves of ADJ Pin Voltage vs Temperature, ADJ Pin Bias Current vs Temperature and ADJ Pin Bias Cur -\nrent vs Input Voltage appear in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nThe adjustable device is tested and specified with the \nADJ pin tied to the OUT pin for a –1.22V output voltage. Specifications for output voltages greater than –1.22V are proportional to the ratio of the desired V\nOUT to –1.22V \n(VOUT/–1.22V). For example, load regulation for an out -\nput current change of –1mA to –1.5A is typically 2mV at  \nVOUT = –1.22V .

Output voltage noise is approximately 240nV/√ Hz over this frequency while operating in unity-gain \nconfiguration. For higher output voltages (using a resistor divider), the output voltage noise gains up accordingly. To lower the output voltage noise for higher output voltages, include a feedforward capacitor (C\nFF) from V OUT to V ADJ. \nA good quality, low leakage, capacitor is recommended. This capacitor bypasses the resistor divider network at high frequencies; and hence, reduces the output noise. With the use of a 10nF feedforward capacitor , the output noise decreases from 220µV\nRMS to 70µV RMS when the output \nvoltage is set to –5V by a 100µA feedback resistor divider .\nHigher values of output voltage noise are often measured \nif care is not exercised with regard to circuit layout and testing. Crosstalk from nearby traces induces unwanted noise onto the L T3015’s output. Moreover , power supply ripple rejection (PSRR) must also be considered, as the L T3015 does not exhibit unlimited PSRR; and thus, a small portion of the input noise propagates to the output.\nUsing a feedforward capacitor (C\nFF) from V OUT to V ADJ has \nthe added benefit of improving transient response and PSRR \nfor output voltages greater than –1.22V. With no feedforward capacitor , the response and settling times will increase as the output voltage is raised above –1.22V. Use the equa -\ntion in Figure 3 to determine the minimum value of C\nFF to \nachieve a transient (and noise) performance that is similar to –1.22V output voltage performance regardless of the chosen output voltage (see T ransient Response and Output Noise in the Typical Performance Characteristics section).\nIt is important to note that the start-up time is affected by \nthe use of a feedforward capacitor . Start-up time is directly proportional to the size of the feedforward capacitor and the output voltage, and is inversely proportional to the feedback resistor divider current. In particular , it slows to 860µs with a 10nF feedforward capacitor and a 10µF output capacitor for an output voltage set to –5V by a 100µA feedback resistor divider current.\nGND\nL T3015\nADJ\nOUTSHDN\nIN VOUTCIN\nVINR1\nR2COUT\nCFF\n3015 F03\nCFF ≥ 10nF/100µA • I FB-DIVIDER\nIFB-DIVIDER  = VOUT/(R1+R2)\nFigure 3. Feedforward Capacitor for Fast T ransient  \nResponse, Low Noise, and High PSRR\nOutput Capacitance and Transient Performance\nThe L T3015 regulators are stable with a wide range of \noutput capacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor affects stability, most notably with small capacitors. Use a mini -\nmum output capacitor of 10µF with an ESR of 500mΩ or less to prevent oscillations. The L T3015’s load transient response is a function of output capacitance. Larger val -\nues of output capacitance decrease the peak deviations and provide improved transient response for larger load current changes.\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic \ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across temperature and applied voltage. The most common dielectrics used are specified with EIA temperature char -\nacteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V , X5R, and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics are good for providing high capacitances in a small package, but they tend to have strong voltage and temperature coefficients as shown in Figures 4 and 5. \nLT3015 Series\n17\n3015fbVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a piezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates voltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, similar to the way a piezoelectric microphone works. For a ceramic capacitor, the stress can be induced by vibra -\ntions in the system or thermal transients. The resulting voltages produced can cause appreciable amounts of noise. A ceramic capacitor produced the trace in Figure 6 in response to light tapping from a pencil. Similar vibration induced behavior can masquerade as increased output voltage noise.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nWhen used with a 5V regulator, a 16V 10μF Y5V capacitor can exhibit an effective value as low as 1μF to 2μF for the DC bias voltage applied and over the operating temperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in more stable characteristics and are more suitable for use as the output capacitor. The X7R type has better stability across tem-perature, while the X5R is less expensive and is available in higher values. Care still must be exercised when using X5R and X7R capacitors; the X5R and X7R codes only specify operating temperature range and maximum capacitance change over temperature. Capacitance change due to DC bias with X5R and X7R capacitors is better than Y5V and Z5U capacitors, but can still be significant enough to drop capacitor values below appropriate levels. Capacitor DC bias characteristics tend to improve as component case size increases, but expected capacitance at operating voltage should be verified in situ for all applications.\nVOUT\n1mV/DIV\nVOUT = –1.3V\nCOUT = 10µF\nIL = 10µA3015 F06\n1ms/DIV\nFigure 6.

Ceramic Capacitor Temperature CharacteristicsOverload Recovery\nLike many IC power regulators, the L T3015 has safe oper -\nating area protection. The safe operating area protection \nactivates at IN-to-OUT differential voltages greater than 8V. The safe area protection decreases current limit as the IN-to-OUT differential voltage increases and keeps the power transistor inside a safe operating region for all values of forward input-to-output voltage up to the L T3015’s Absolute Maximum Ratings. \nWhen power is first applied and input voltage rises, the \noutput follows the input and keeps the IN-to-OUT differential voltage small, allowing the regulator to supply large output currents and start-up into high current loads. With a high input voltage, a problem can occur wherein removal of an output short does not allow the output voltage to fully recover. Other L TC negative linear regulators such as the L T1175 and L T1964 also exhibit this phenomenon, so it is not unique to the L T3015.\nLT3015 Series\n18\n3015fbAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe problem occurs with a heavy output load when input \nvoltage is high and output voltage is low. Such situations occur easily after the removal of a short-circuit or if the shutdown pin is pulled high after the input voltage has already been turned on. The load line for such a load intersects the output current curve at two points. If this happens, the regulator has two stable output operating points. With this double intersection, the input power supply may need to be cycled down to zero and brought up again to make the output recover.\nShutdown/UVLO\nThe SHDN\n pin is used to put the L T3015 into a micro  power \nshutdown state. The L T3015 has an accurate –1.20V \nthreshold (during turn-on) on the SHDN  pin. This threshold \ncan be used in conjunction with a resistor divider from the system input supply to define an accurate undervoltage lockout (UVLO) threshold for the regulator . The SHDN pin \ncurrent (at the threshold) needs to be considered when determining the resistor divider network. \nThermal Considerations\nThe L T3015’s maximum rated junction temperature of \n125°C limits its power handling capability. T wo components comprise the power dissipated by the device:\n1. Output current multiplied by the input-to-output dif -\nferential voltage: I OUT\t•\t(VIN - VOUT) and\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage:  \nIGND\t•\tVIN\nDetermine GND pin current using the GND Pin Current \ncurves in the Typical Performance Characteristics sec -\ntion. Total power dissipation is the sum of the above two components.The L T3015 regulators incorporate a thermal shutdown circuit designed to protect the device during overload conditions. The typical thermal shutdown temperature is 165°C and the circuit incorporates about 8°C of hyster -\nesis. For continuous normal conditions, do not exceed the maximum junction temperature rating of 125°C. Carefully consider all sources of thermal resistance from junction to ambient, including other heat sources mounted in close proximity to the L T3015.\nThe undersides of the DFN and MSOP packages have ex -\nposed metal from the lead frame to the die attachment. Both packages allow heat to directly transfer from the die junction to the printed circuit board metal to control maximum operating junction temperature. The dual-in-line pin arrangement allows metal to extend beyond the ends of the package on the topside (component side) of the PCB. Connect this metal to IN on the PCB. The multiple IN and OUT pins of the L T3015 also assist in spreading heat to the PCB.\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board and its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated through-holes can also be used to spread the heat gener -\nated by power devices.\nTables 2-4 list thermal resistance as a function of copper \narea in a fixed board size. All measurements were taken in still air on a 4 layer FR-4 board with 1oz solid internal planes and 2oz top/bottom external trace planes with a total board thickness of 1.6mm. The four layers were electrically isolated with no thermal vias present. PCB layers, copper weight, board layout and thermal vias will affect the resul -\ntant thermal resistance. For more information on thermal resistance and high thermal conductivity test boards, refer to JEDEC standard JESD51, notably JESD51-12 and JESD51-7. Achieving low thermal resistance necessitates attention to detail and careful PCB layout.\nLT3015 Series\n19\n3015fbTable 2.

Therefore, the junction temperature rise above ambient approximately equals:\n\t 0.505W \t•\t41°C/W\t=\t20.7°C\nThe maximum junction temperature equals the maxi-mum ambient temperature plus the maximum junction temperature rise above ambient or:\n TJMAX = 85°C + 20.7°C = 105.7°C\nProtection Features\nThe L T3015 incorporates several protection features that \nmake it ideal for use in battery-powered applications. In addition to the normal protection features associated with monolithic regulators, such as current limiting and thermal limiting, the device protects itself against reverse input voltages and reverse output voltages.\nPrecision current limit and thermal overload protections \nare intended to protect the L T3015 against current over -\nload conditions at the output of the device. For normal operation, do not allow the the junction temperature to exceed 125°C.\nPulling the L T3015’s output above ground induces no \ndamage to the part. If IN is left open circuit or grounded, OUT can be pulled above GND by 30V. In addition, OUT acts like an open circuit, i.e. no current flows into the pin. If IN is powered by a voltage source, OUT sinks the L T3105’s short-circuit current and protects itself by thermal limiting. In this case, grounding the SHDN pin turns off the device \nand stops OUT from sinking the short-circuit current.\nLT3015 Series\n20\n3015fbTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nAdjustable Current Sink\nGND\nL T3015\nADJ\nOUTSHDN\nIN VIN < –2.3VR1\n2k\nL T1004-1.2R282.5k\nR4\n0.01/uni03A9R3\n2kC110µFR8100k\nC210µF\nR7475/uni03A9C3\n1µF\n1\n432 8R5\n2.2k\nC43.3µF\nNOTE: ADJUST R3 FOR 0 TO –1.5A CONSTANT CURRENT\n3015 TA04RLOAD\nR62.2k–+1/2\nL T1350\nLT3015 Series\n21\n3015fbPACKAGE DESCRIPTION\nPlease refer to http://www.linear .com/designtools/packaging/ for the most recent package drawings.\n3.00 ±0.10\n(4 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
