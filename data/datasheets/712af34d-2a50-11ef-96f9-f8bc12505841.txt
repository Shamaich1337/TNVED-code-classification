Relative to anyattached 1-Wire slave device, the DS2482-100 is a1-Wire master. Internal, factory-trimmed timers relievethe system host processor from generating time-critical1-Wire waveforms, supporting both standard and over-drive 1-Wire communication speeds. To optimize1-Wire waveform generation, the DS2482-100 performsslew-rate control on rising and falling 1-Wire edges andprovides additional programmable features to matchdrive characteristics to the 1-Wire slave environment.Programmable, strong pullup features support 1-Wirepower delivery to 1-Wire devices such as EEPROMsand sensors. The DS2482-100 combines these featureswith an output to control an external MOSFET forenhanced strong pullup application. The I\n2C slave\naddress assignment is controlled by two binaryaddress inputs, resolving potential conflicts with otherI\n2C slave devices in the system.\nApplicationsBenefits and Features\n•Allows Easy Interface Between a I 2C Microport and a\n1-Wire Slave\n•I2C Host Interface Supports 100kHz and 400kHz\nI2C Communication Speeds\n•1-Wire Master IO with Selectable Active or Passive\n1-Wire Pullup\n•Provides Reset/Presence, 8-Bit, Single-Bit, and3-Bit 1-Wire IO Sequences\n•Standard and Overdrive 1-Wire CommunicationSpeeds\n•Two Address Inputs for I 2C Address Assignment\n•Minimizes Line Noise Reducing System EMI\n•Slew-Controlled 1-Wire Edges\n•Supports EEPROMs, Temperature Sensors, or Other \n1-Wire Slaves That Have Momentary High Source \nCurrent Modes\n•Strong 1-Wire Pullup Provided by an Internal Low-\nImpedance Signal Path\n•PCTLZ Output to Optionally Control an ExternalMOSFET for Stronger Pullup Requirements\n•Operating Range: 2.9V to 5.5V, -40°C to +85°C\n•8-Pin (150 mils) SO and 9-Bump WLP Packages\n19-4930; Rev 10; 1/15Printers\nMedical InstrumentsIndustrial SensorsCell Phones, PDAs\nTypical Operating Circuit\n1-Wire is a registered trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.DS2482-100SDA\nSCL\nAD1AD0PCTLZ\nIORP*\n*RP = I2C PULLUP RESISTOR (SEE THE APPLICATIONS INFORMATION SECTION FOR R P SIZING).VCC\nCURRENT-LIMITING\nRESISTORREFER TO APPLICATIONNOTE 4206\nOPTIONAL\nCIRCUITRY\n1-Wire LINE µC(I2C PORT)\n1-Wire\nDEVICE1-Wire\nDEVICE1-Wire\nDEVICE Pin Configurations and Ordering Information appear at end \nof data sheet.\nMaxim Integrated  |  2 www.maximintegrated.comDS2482-100 Single-Channel 1-Wire Master\nAbsolute Maximum Ratings\nElectrical Characteristics\n(VCC= 2.9V to 5.5V, T A= -40°C to +85°C.)Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device.

Block Diagram\nDetailed Description\nThe DS2482-100 is a self-timed 1-Wire master that sup-\nports advanced 1-Wire waveform features includingstandard and overdrive speeds, active pullup, andstrong pullup for power delivery. The active pullupaffects rising edges on the 1-Wire side. The strongpullup function uses the same pullup transistor as theactive pullup, but with a different control algorithm. Inaddition, the strong pullup activates the PCTLZ pin,controlling optional external circuitry to deliver addition-al power beyond the capabilities of the on-chip pulluptransistor. Once supplied with command and data, theinput/output controller of the DS2482-100 performstime-critical 1-Wire communication functions such as\nreset/presence-detect cycle, read-byte, write-byte, sin-gle-bit R/ W, and triplet for ROM Search, without requir-\ning interaction with the host processor. The host obtainsfeedback (completion of a 1-Wire function, presencepulse, 1-Wire short, search direction taken) through theStatus Register and data through the Read DataRegister. The DS2482-100 communicates with a hostprocessor through its I\n2C bus interface in standard\nmode or in fast mode. The logic state of two address pinsdetermines the I\n2C slave address of the DS2482-100,\nallowing up to four devices operating on the same bussegment without requiring a hub.

Rising Edge PullupConfiguration Register Bit Assignment\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0 \n1WS SPU  1 APU 1WS SPU 0 APU Device Registers\nThe DS2482-100 has three registers that the I 2C host\ncan read: Configuration, Status, and Read Data. Theseregisters are addressed by a read pointer. The positionof the read pointer, i.e., the register that the host readsin a subsequent read access, is defined by the instruc-tion the DS2482-100 executed last. To enable certain1-Wire features, the host has read and write access tothe Configuration Register.\nConfiguration Register\nThe DS2482-100 supports three 1-Wire features thatare enabled or selected through the ConfigurationRegister. These features are:\n• Active Pullup (APU)• Strong Pullup (SPU)• 1-Wire Speed (1WS)These features can be selected in any combination.\nWhile APU and 1WS maintain their state, SPU returns toits inactive state as soon as the strong pullup has ended.\nAfter a device reset (power-up cycle or initiated by the\nDevice Reset command), the Configuration Registerreads 00h. When writing to the Configuration Register,the new data is accepted only if the upper nibble (bits 7to 4) is the one’s complement of the lower nibble (bits 3to 0). When read, the upper nibble is always 0h.Active Pullup (APU)\nThe APU bit controls whether an active pullup (con-trolled slew-rate transistor) or a passive pullup (R\nWPU\nresistor) is used to drive a 1-Wire line from low to high.When APU = 0, active pullup is disabled (resistormode). Active pullup should always be selected unlessthere is only a single slave on the 1-Wire line. The\nactive pullup does not apply to the rising edge of apresence pulse or a recovery after a short on the1-Wire line.\nThe circuit that controls rising edges (Figure 2) oper-\nates as follows: At t\n1, the pulldown (from DS2482-100\nor 1-Wire slave) ends. From this point on, the 1-Wirebus is pulled high through R\nWPU internal to the\nDS2482-100. V CCand the capacitive load of the 1-Wire\nline determine the slope. In case that active pullup isdisabled (APU = 0), the resistive pullup continues, asrepresented by the solid line. With active pullupenabled (APU = 1), and when at t\n2the voltage has\nreached a level between V IL1(MAX) and V IH1(MIN) , the\nDS2482-100 actively pulls the 1-Wire line high, applyinga controlled slew rate as represented by the dashedline. The active pullup continues until t\nAPUOT is expired\nat t3. From that time on the resistive pullup continues.\nSee the Strong Pullup (SPU) section for a way to keep\nthe pullup transistor conducting beyond t 3.\nMaxim Integrated  |  7 www.maximintegrated.comDS2482-100 Single-Channel 1-Wire Master\nStrong Pullup (SPU)\nThe SPU bit is used to activate the strong pullup func-\ntion prior to a 1-Wire Write Byte or 1-Wire Single Bitcommand. Strong pullup is commonly used with 1-WireEEPROM devices when copying scratchpad data to themain memory or when performing an SHA-1 computa-tion and with parasitically powered temperature sen-sors or A/D converters. The respective device datasheets specify the location in the communications pro-tocol after which the strong pullup should be applied.The SPU bit must be set immediately prior to issuingthe command that puts the 1-Wire device into the statewhere it needs the extra power. The strong pullup usesthe same internal pullup transistor as the active pullupfeature. For cases where the internal strong pullup hasinsufficient strength, the PCTLZ pin can be used to con-trol an external p-channel MOSFET to supply additionalpower beyond the drive capability of the DS2482-100 tothe 1-Wire line. See the ΔV\nSTRPU parameter in the\nElectrical Characteristics to determine if the internal\nstrong pullup is sufficient given the current load on thedevice.\nIf SPU is 1, the DS2482-100 treats the rising edge of the\ntime slot in which the strong pullup starts as if the activepullup was activated. However, in contrast to the activepullup, the strong pullup, i.e., the internal pullup transistor,remains conducting, as shown in Figure 3, until one ofthree events occurs: the DS2482-100 receives a commandthat generates 1-Wire communication (the typical case);the SPU bit in the Configuration Register is written to 0; orthe DS2482-100 receives the Device Reset command. Aslong as the strong pullup is active, the PCTLZ output is low.\nWhen the strong pullup ends, the SPU bit is automati-cally reset to 0. Using the strong pullup feature doesnot change the state of the APU bit in the ConfigurationRegister. Note: Strong pullup also affects the 1-Wire\nReset command. If enabled, it can cause incorrectreading of the presence pulse and may cause a viola-tion of the device’s absolute maximum rating.\n1-Wire Speed (1WS)\nThe 1WS bit determines the timing of any 1-Wire com-munication generated by the DS2482-100. All 1-Wireslave devices support standard speed (1WS = 0),where the transfer of a single bit (t\nSLOT in Figure 3) is\ncompleted within 65µs. Many 1-Wire devices can alsocommunicate at a higher data rate, called overdrivespeed. To change from standard to overdrive speed, a1-Wire device needs to receive an Overdrive-Skip ROMor Overdrive-Match ROM command, as explained inthe 1-Wire device data sheets. The change in speedoccurs immediately after the 1-Wire device hasreceived the speed-changing command code. TheDS2482-100 must take part in this speed change tostay synchronized. This is accomplished by writing tothe Configuration Register with the 1WS bit as 1 \nimme-\ndiately after the 1-Wire Byte command that changes the\nspeed of a 1-Wire device. Writing to the ConfigurationRegister with the 1WS bit as 0, followed by a 1-WireReset command, changes the DS2482-100 and any1-Wire devices on the active 1-Wire line back to stan-dard speed.\nDS2482-100 RESISTIVE PULLUP DS2482-100 PULLDOWN DS2482-100 STRONG PULLUPVCC\n0V\nPCTLZWRITE-ZERO CASEWRITE-ONE CASE\ntSLOTLAST BIT OF 1-Wire WRITE BYTE OR 1-Wire SINGLE BIT FUNCTION\nNEXT\nTIME SLOTOR 1-WireRESET\nFigure 3. Low-Impedance Pullup Timing\nMaxim Integrated  |  8 www.maximintegrated.comDS2482-100 Single-Channel 1-Wire Master\nStatus Register\nThe read-only Status Register is the general means for\nthe DS2482-100 to report bit-type data from the 1-Wireside, 1-Wire busy status, and its own reset status to thehost processor. All 1-Wire communication commandsand the Device Reset command position the readpointer at the Status Register for the host processor toread with minimal protocol overhead. Status informationis updated during the execution of certain commandsonly. Details are given in the description of the variousstatus bits that follow.\n1-Wire Busy (1WB)\nThe 1WB bit reports to the host processor whether the1-Wire line is busy. During 1-Wire communication 1WBis 1; once the command is completed, 1WB returns toits default 0. Details on when 1WB changes state andfor how long it remains at 1 are found in the \nFunction\nCommands section.\nPresence-Pulse Detect (PPD)\nThe PPD bit is updated with every 1-Wire Reset com-mand. If the DS2482-100 detects a presence pulse froma 1-Wire device at t\nMSP during the presence-detect\ncycle, the PPD bit is set to 1. This bit returns to its default0 if there is no presence pulse or if the 1-Wire line isshorted during a subsequent 1-Wire Reset command.\nShort Detected (SD)\nThe SD bit is updated with every 1-Wire Reset com-mand. If the DS2482-100 detects a logic 0 on the1-Wire line at t\nSIduring the presence-detect cycle, the\nSD bit is set to 1. This bit returns to its default 0 with asubsequent 1-Wire Reset command provided that theshort has been removed. If SD is 1, PPD is 0. TheDS2482-100 cannot distinguish between a short and aDS1994 or DS2404 signaling a 1-Wire interrupt. For thisreason, if a DS2404 or DS1994 is used in the applica-tion, the interrupt function must be disabled. The inter-rupt signaling is explained in the respective 1-Wiredevice data sheets. Logic Level (LL)\nThe LL bit reports the logic state of the active 1-Wireline without initiating any 1-Wire communication. The1-Wire line is sampled for this purpose every time theStatus Register is read. The sampling and updating ofthe LL bit takes place when the host processor hasaddressed the DS2482-100 in read mode (during theacknowledge cycle), provided that the read pointer ispositioned at the Status Register.\nDevice Reset (RST)\nIf the RST bit is 1, the DS2482-100 has performed aninternal reset cycle, either caused by a power-on resetor from executing the Device Reset command. The RSTbit is cleared automatically when the DS2482-100 exe-cutes a Write Configuration command to restore theselection of the desired 1-Wire features.\nSingle Bit Result (SBR)\nThe SBR bit reports the logic state of the active 1-Wire linesampled at t\nMSR of a 1-Wire Single Bit command or the\nfirst bit of a 1-Wire Triplet command. The power-on defaultof SBR is 0. If the 1-Wire Single Bit command sends a 0bit, SBR should be 0. With a 1-Wire Triplet command,SBR could be 0 as well as 1, depending on the responseof the 1-Wire devices connected. The same result appliesto a 1-Wire Single Bit command that sends a 1 bit.\nTriplet Second Bit (TSB)\nThe TSB bit reports the logic state of the active 1-Wireline sampled at t\nMSR of the second bit of a 1-Wire\nTriplet command. The power-on default of TSB is 0.This bit is updated only with a 1-Wire Triplet commandand has no function with other commands.\nBranch Direction Taken (DIR)\nWhenever a 1-Wire Triplet command is executed, thisbit reports to the host processor the search directionthat was chosen by the third bit of the triplet. Thepower-on default of DIR is 0. This bit is updated onlywith a 1-Wire Triplet command and has no function withother commands.

The feedback path to the host is controlled by aread pointer, which is set automatically by each func-tion command for the host to efficiently access relevantinformation. The host processor sends these com-mands and applicable parameters as strings of one ortwo bytes using the I\n2C interface. The I 2C protocol\nrequires that each byte be acknowledged by thereceiving party to confirm acceptance or not beacknowledged to indicate an error condition (invalidcode or parameter) or to end the communication.

Both SDA and SCL are bidi-rectional lines, connected to a positive supply voltagethrough a pullup resistor. When there is no communica-tion, both lines are high. The output stages of devicesconnected to the bus must have an open drain or opencollector to perform the wired-AND function. Data onthe I\n2C bus can be transferred at rates of up to\n100kbps in standard mode and up to 400kbps in fastmode. The DS2482-100 works in both modes.\nA device that sends data on the bus is defined as a\ntransmitter, and a device receiving data is defined as areceiver. The device that controls the communication iscalled a master. The devices that are controlled by themaster are slaves. To be individually accessed, eachdevice must have a slave address that does not conflictwith other devices on the bus.\nData transfers can be initiated only when the bus is not\nbusy. The master generates the serial clock (SCL), con-trols the bus access, generates the START and STOPconditions, and determines the number of data bytestransferred between START and STOP (Figure 7). Datais transferred in bytes with the most significant bit beingtransmitted first. After each byte follows an acknowledge\nbit to allow synchronization between master and slave.\nSlave Address\nThe slave address to which the DS2482-100 respondsis shown in Figure 8. The logic state at the address pinsAD0 and AD1 determines the value of the address bitsA0 and A1. The address pins allow the device torespond to one of four possible slave addresses. Theslave address is part of the slave address/control byte.The last bit of the slave address/control byte (R/ W)\ndefines the data direction. When set to 0, subsequentdata flows from master to slave (write access); whenset to 1, data flows from slave to master (read access).SDA\nSCL\nIDLE1–7 8 9 1–7 8 9 1–7 8 9\nSTART\nCONDITION STOP CONDITION \nREPEATED STARTSLAVE\nADDRESSR/W ACK ACK DATA ACK/\nNACKDATAMSB FIRST MSB LSB MSB LSB\nREPEATED IF MORE BYTES\nARE TRANSFERRED\nFigure 7.

The timing references are\ndefined in Figure 9.\nBus Idle or Not Busy: Both SDA and SCL are inac-\ntive and in their logic-high states.\nSTART Condition: To initiate communication with a\nslave, the master must generate a START condition.A START condition is defined as a change in state ofSDA from high to low while SCL remains high.\nSTOP Condition: To end communication with a\nslave, the master must generate a STOP condition. ASTOP condition is defined as a change in state ofSDA from low to high while SCL remains high.\nRepeated START Condition: Repeated STARTs are\ncommonly used for read accesses to select a spe-cific data source or address to read from. The mas-ter can use a repeated START condition at the endof a data transfer to immediately initiate a new datatransfer following the current one. A repeated STARTcondition is generated the same way as a normalSTART condition, but without leaving the bus idleafter a STOP condition.\nData Valid: With the exception of the START and\nSTOP condition, transitions of SDA can occur onlyduring the low state of SCL. The data on SDA mustremain valid and unchanged during the entire highpulse of SCL plus the required setup and hold time(t\nHD:DAT after the falling edge of SCL and t SU:DATbefore the rising edge of SCL; see Figure 9). Thereis one clock pulse per bit of data. Data is shifted intothe receiving device during the rising edge of SCL.\nWhen finished with writing, the master must release\nthe SDA line for a sufficient amount of setup time(minimum t\nSU:DAT + tRin Figure 9) before the next\nrising edge of SCL to start reading. The slave shiftsout each data bit on SDA at the falling edge of theprevious SCL pulse and the data bit is valid at therising edge of the current SCL pulse. The mastergenerates all SCL clock pulses, including thoseneeded to read from a slave.\nAcknowledge: Typically a receiving device, when\naddressed, is obliged to generate an acknowledgeafter the receipt of each byte. The master must gen-erate a clock pulse that is associated with thisacknowledge bit. A device that acknowledges mustpull SDA low during the acknowledge clock pulse insuch a way that SDA is stable low during the highperiod of the acknowledge-related clock pulse plusthe required setup and hold time (t\nHD:DAT after the\nfalling edge of SCL and t SU:DAT before the rising\nedge of SCL).\nNot Acknowledged by Slave: A slave device may\nbe unable to receive or transmit data, for example,because it is busy performing some real-time func-tion. In this case, the slave device does not acknowl-edge its slave address and leaves the SDA line high.A slave device that is ready to communicateacknowledges at least its slave address. However,SCL\nNOTE:  TIMING IS REFERENCED TO V IL(MAX)  AND V IH(MIN) .SDA\nSTOP START REPEATED\nSTARTSPIKE\nSUPPRESSIONtBUF\ntHD:STA\ntHD:DAT tSU:DATtSU:STOtHD:STAtSP\ntSU:STAtHIGH\ntRtF\ntLOW\nFigure 9.

In this case, the slave device does notacknowledge any of the bytes that it refuses andleaves SDA high. In either case, after a slave hasfailed to acknowledge, the master first should gener-ate a repeated START condition or a STOP conditionfollowed by a START condition to begin a new datatransfer.\nNot Acknowledged by Master: At some time when\nreceiving data, the master must signal an end ofdata to the slave device. To achieve this, the masterdoes not acknowledge the last byte that it hasreceived from the slave. In response, the slavereleases SDA, allowing the master to generate theSTOP condition.\nWriting to the DS2482-100\nTo write to the DS2482-100, the master must accessthe device in write mode, i.e., the slave address mustbe sent with the direction bit set to 0. The next byte tobe sent is a command code, which, depending on thecommand, may be followed by a command parameter.The DS2482-100 acknowledges valid command codesand expected/valid command parameters. Additionalbytes or invalid command parameters are neveracknowledged.\nReading from the DS2482-100\nTo read from the DS2482-100, the master must accessthe device in read mode, i.e., the slave address mustbe sent with the direction bit set to 1. The read pointerdetermines the register that the master reads from. Themaster can continue reading the same register overand over again, without having to readdress the device,e.g., to watch the 1WB changing from 1 to 0. To readfrom a different register, the master must issue the SetRead Pointer command and then access the DS2482-100 again in read mode.I2C Communication Example\nSee Tables 4 and 5 for the I 2C communication legend\nand data direction codes.\nTable 4.

This DC\ncondition determines the minimum value of the pullupresistor as:\nR\nP(MIN) = (V CC- 0.4V)/3mA\nWith an operating voltage of 5.5V, the minimum value\nfor the pullup resistor is 1.7k Ω. The “MINIMUM R P” line\nin Figure 11 shows how the minimum pullup resistorchanges with the operating voltage.\nFor I\n2C systems, the rise time and fall time are mea-\nsured from 30% to 70% of the pullup voltage. The maxi-mum bus capacitance, C\nB, is 400pF. The maximum risetime must not exceed 1000ns at standard speed and\n300ns at fast speed. Assuming maximum rise time, themaximum resistor value at any given capacitance C\nBis\ncalculated as:\nRPMAXS = 1000ns/[C Bx ln(7/3)] (standard speed)\nRPMAXF = 300ns/[C Bx ln(7/3)] (fast speed)\nFor a bus capacitance of 400pF, the maximum pullup\nresistor values are 2.95k Ωat standard speed and 885 Ω\nat fast speed. A value between 1.7k Ωand 2.95k Ω\nmeets all requirements at standard speed.\nBecause an 885 Ωpullup resistor, as would be required\nto meet the rise time specification at fast speed and400pF bus capacitance, is lower than R\nP(MIN) at 5.5V, a\ndifferent approach is necessary. The “MAX LOAD ATMIN R\nPFAST MODE” line in Figure 11 is generated by\nfirst calculating the minimum pullup resistor at anygiven operating voltage (“MINIMUM R\nP” line) and then\ncalculating the respective bus capacitance that yields a300ns rise time.\nOnly for pullup voltages of 3V and lower can the maximum\npermissible bus capacitance of 400pF be maintained.
