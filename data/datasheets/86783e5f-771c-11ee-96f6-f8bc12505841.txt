The part uses a 25 -bit fixed modulus, allowing sub hertz \nfrequency resolution . \nThe ADF4159 consists of a low noise digital phase frequency \ndetector (PFD), a precision charge pump, and a programmable \nreference divider. The  Σ-Δ-based fractional interpolator allow s \nprogrammable fractional -N division. The INT and FRA C registers \ndefine an overall N  divider as N = INT + (FRAC/225). \nThe ADF4159 can be used to implement f requency shift keying \n(FSK) and phase shift keying (PSK) modulation. Frequency sweep  \nmodes are also available to generate various wav eforms in the \nfrequency domain, for example,  sawtooth and triangular wave -\nforms. Sweeps can be set to run automatically or with each step \nmanually triggered by an external pulse. The ADF4159 features \ncycle slip reduction circuitry, which enables  faster lock times  \nwithout the need for modifications to the loop filter.  \nControl of all on -chip registe rs is via a simple 3 -wire inter face. The \nADF4159 operates with a n analog power supply in the range  of \n2.7 V to 3. 45 V and a  digital power supply  in the range of  1.62 V \nto 1.98 V. The device  can be powered down when not in use.  \n \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAG RAM  \nLOCK\nDETECTCP\nDATA\nLE32-BIT\nDATA\nREGISTERCLK\nAGNDDVDDDGND\nRDIVSDOUT\nNDIV\nDGND CPGNDSDVDD DVDD AVDD VP\nCERFINA\nRFINBOUTPUT\nMUXMUXOUT–+\nHIGH-ZPHASE\nFREQUENCY\nDETECTORADF4159\nTHIRD-ORDER\nFRACTIONAL\nINTERPOLATOR\nFRACTION\nVALUEINTEGER\nVALUECHARGE\nPUMP\nTXDATAREFERENCERSET\nREFIN×2\nDOUBLER5-BIT\nR COUNTER\n÷2\nDIVIDER\nMODULUS\n225VALUEN COUNTER+\n–SW2\nSW1\nSDGND\n10849-001FAST LOCK\nSWITCHCSR\n \nFigure 1.  \nADF4159  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

This small signal  input is normally ac-coupled from the VCO. \n6, 7, 8 AV DD Positive Power Supply for the RF Section. Place decoupling capacitors to the ground plane as close as possible \nto these pins. \n9 REF IN Reference Input. This CMOS input has a nominal threshold of DV DD/2 and an equivalent inp ut resistance of 100 kΩ. \nIt can be driven from a TTL or CMOS crystal oscillator, or it can be ac-coupled. \n10 DGND Digital Ground. \n11 SDGND Digital Σ-Δ Modulator Ground. This pin is the ground return path for the Σ-Δ modulator. \n12 TX DATA Transmit Data Pin. This pin provides the data to be transmitted in FSK or PSK mode and also controls some \nramping functionality. \n13 CE Chip Enable (1.8 V Logic). A logic low on this pin pow ers down the device and places the charge pump output \ninto three-state mode. \n14 CLK Serial Clock Input. This input is used to clock in the serial data to the registers. The data is latched into the input \nshift register on the CLK rising edge. This  input is a high impedance CMOS input. \n15 DATA Serial Data Input. The serial  data is loaded MSB first; the three LSBs are the control bits. This input is a high \nimpedance CMOS input. \n16 LE Load Enable Input. When LE is high, the data stored in the input shift register is loaded into one of the eight \nlatches; the latch is selected using the control bi ts. This input is a high impedance CMOS input. \n17 MUXOUT Multiplexer Output. This pin allows various internal signals to be accessed externally. \n18 SDV DD Power Supply for the Digital Σ-Δ Modulator.

RF INT  Divider  \n 25-BIT FIXED MODULUS  \nThe ADF4159 has a 25 -bit fixed modulus. This modulus allows \noutput fre quencies to be spaced with a resolution of  \nfRES = fPFD/225 (1) \nwhere fPFD is the frequency of the phase frequency detector \n(PFD). For example, with a PFD frequency of 10 0 MHz, \nfrequency steps of 2 .98 Hz are possible. Due to the architecture \nof the Σ -Δ modu lator, there is a fixed +(f PFD/226) offset on the \nVCO output. To remove this offset, see the Σ -Δ Modulator \nMode  section.  \nINT, FRAC , AND R COUNTER RELATIONSHIP  \nThe INT and FRAC values , in conjunction with the R counter , \nmake it pos sible to generate output frequencies that are spaced \nby fractions of the PFD  frequency .  \nThe RF VCO frequency (RF OUT) equation is  \nRF OUT = (INT + (FRAC /225)) × fPFD (2) \nwhere:  \nRF OUT is the output frequency of the external voltage  \ncontrolled oscillator (VC O).  \nINT is the preset divide ratio of  the binary 12 -bit counter  \n(23 to 4095).  \nFRAC  is the numerator of the fractional division (0 to (225 − 1)). \nThe PFD  frequency (f PFD) equation is  \nfPFD = REF IN × [(1 + D )/(R × (1 +  T))] (3) \nwhere:   \nREF IN is the reference input frequency.  \nD is the REF IN doubler bit (0 or 1).  \nR is the preset divide ratio of the binary 5 -bit programmable \nreference  (R) counter (1 to 32).  \nT is the REF IN divide -by-2 bit (0 or 1).  \nR COUNTER  \nThe 5 -bit R  counter allows the input reference frequency (REF IN) \nto be divided down to supply  the reference clock to the PFD. \nDivision ratios from 1 to 32 are allowed.  \nADF4159  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

MUXOUT Schematic  INPUT SHIFT REGISTER  \nThe ADF4159 digita l section includes a 5 -bit R  counter, a 12- bit \nINT counter, and a 25 -bit FRAC counter. Data is clocked into the  \n32-bit input shift register on each rising edge of CLK. The data \nis clocked in M SB first. Data is transferred from the input shift \nregister to one of eight la tches on the rising edge of LE.  \nThe destination latch is determined by the state of the three control bits (C3, C2, and C1) in the input shift register. As shown  \nin Figure 2, the control bits are the three LSBs  (DB2, DB1, and \nDB0 , respectively).  Table 7 shows t he truth table for these bits . \nFigure 23 and Figure 24 provide  a summary of how the latches \nare programmed.  \nTable 7.

Before the pa rt uses a new value for any \ndouble -buffered setting, the following two events must occur:  \n1. The new value is latched into the device by writing to the appropriate register.  \n2. A new write is  performed to Register 0 (R0). \nFor example, updating the fractional val ue involves a write to \nthe 13 LSB bits in R1 and the 12 MSB bits in R0. R1 must  be \nwritten to first, followed by the write to R0. The frequency change  \nbegin s after the write to R0. Double -buffering ensures that the \nbits written to R1 do not take effect until after the write to R0.  \n \n \n \nData Sheet  ADF4159  \n \nRev.

Note \nthat the signal at the PFD must have a 50% duty cycle for cycle \nslip reduction to work.  In addition, the charge pump current \nsetting must be set to its  minimum  value . For more information,  \nsee the Cycle Slip Reduction for Faster Lock Times  section.  \nThe cycle slip reduction feature can be used  only when the phase \ndetector polarity setting is positive ( Bit DB6 = 1 in Register R3). \nCSR  cannot be used if the phase detector polarity setting is  nega -\ntive (Bit DB6 = 0 in Register R3) . \nCharge Pump Current Setting  \nBits DB[27 :24] set the charge pump current (see Figure 27).  \nSet these bits to the charge pump current that th e loop filter  \nis designed with.  Best practice is to design the loop filter for a \ncharge pump current of 2.5 mA or 2.81 mA and then use the programmable charge pump current to twea k the frequency \nresponse. See the Reference Doubler  section for information on \nsetting the charge pump current when the doubler is enabled.  \nPrescaler (P/P + 1)  \nThe dual -modulus prescaler (P/P + 1), a long with the INT, \nFRAC, and fi xed modulus  values , determine s the overall \ndivision ratio from RF IN to the PFD input. Bit DB22 sets the \nprescaler value.  \nOperating at CML levels, the prescaler takes the clock from the RF input stage and divides it down for the counters. The prescaler  \nis based on a synchronous 4/5 core. When the prescaler is set to \n4/5, the m aximum RF frequency allowed is 8  GHz. Therefore, when operating the ADF4159  at frequencies greater than  8 GHz,  \nthe prescaler  must be set to 8/9. The prescaler limits the INT \nvalue  as follows:  \n• Prescaler = 4/5: N\nMIN = 23 \n• Prescaler = 8/9 : NMIN = 75 \nRDIV2  \nWhen  Bit DB21 is set  to 1, a divide -by-2 toggle flip -flop is \ninserted between the R  counter and the PFD. This feature  \ncan be us ed to provide a 50% duty cy cle signal at the PFD. \nReference Doubler  \nWhen  Bit DB20 is set to 0 , the reference doubler  is disabled,  \nand the REF IN signal is fed directly to the 5 -bit R counter . When \nBit DB20 is set to 1, the reference doubler  is enabled, and  the REF IN \nfrequency is multipl ied by a factor of 2 before the signal  is fed  into \nthe 5 -bit R counter . When the doubler is disabled, the REF IN \nfalling edge is the active edge at the PFD input to the fractional \nsynthesizer. When the doubler is enabled, both  the rising and \nfalling edge s of REF IN become active edges at the PFD input . \nWhen the reference doubler is enabled, for optimum phase \nnoise performance, it is recommended to only use charge pump current settings 0b0000 to 0b0111, that is, 0.31 mA to 2.5 mA . \nIn this case, best practice is to design the loop filter to for a charge pump current of 1.25 mA or 1.57 mA and then use the programmable charge pump current to tweak the frequency response.  \n5-Bit R Counter  \nThe 5 -bit R counter (Bits DB[19:15]) allows the  input reference \nfrequency (REF IN) to be divided down to supply  the reference \nclock to the PFD. Division ratios from 1 to 32 are allowed. \n12- Bit CLK 1 Divider  Value  \nBits DB[14:3] program  the CLK 1 divider  value , which determines  \nthe duration of  the time step  in ramp mode.  \n \n \nADF4159  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

E | Page 19 of 36 FUNCTION REGISTER (R 3) MAP  \nWhen Bits  DB[2:0] are set to 011, the on -chip function  register \n(Register R 3) is programmed  (see Figure 28). \nReserv ed Bits  \nAll reserved bits except Bit DB17 must  be set to 0 for normal \noperation.  Bit DB17 must be set to 1 for normal operation.  \nNegative Bleed Current  \nBits DB[24:22] set the negative bleed current value (I BLEED ). \nCalculate IBLEED  using the following formu la, and then select the \nvalue of Bits DB[24:22] that is closest to the calculated value.  \nIBLEED  = (4 × I CP)/N \nwhere:  \nICP is the charge pump current . \nN is the N counter value.  \nNegative Bleed Current Enable  \nDB21 enables a negative bleed current in the charge  pump. When  \nthe charge pump is operating in a nonlinear region, phase noise \nand spurious performance can degrade. Negative bleed current \noperates by pushing the charge pump operation region away \nfrom this nonlinear region. The programmability feature contr ols \nhow far the region of operation is moved. If the current is too little, the charge pump will remain in the non linear region; if \nthe current is too high, the charge pump will become unstable \nor degrade the maximum PFD frequency. It is necessary to expe r-\niment  with various charge pump currents to find the optimum.  \nThe formula for calculating the optimum negative bleed current \nis shown in the Negative Bleed Current  section; however, exper -\nimentation may show a different current g ives the optimum result.  \nLoss of Lock (LOL)  \nBit DB16 enables  or disables the loss of lock indication. When \nthis bit is set to 0, the part indicates loss of lock even when the \nreference is remov ed. T his feature provides an advantage over \nthe standard  implem entation of lock detect.  For more robust \noperation, set this bit to 1 . The loss of lock does  not operate as \nexpected when negative bleed current is enabled.  \nN SEL  \nBit DB15 can be  used to circumvent  the issue of pipeline dela y \nbetween  update s of the integer  and fractional values in the \nN counter. Typically, the  INT value is loaded first, followed by \nthe FRAC value. This can cause the N  counter value to be incor -\nrect for a brief period of time  equal to the pipeline delay (about  \nfour PFD cycles ). This delay has no effect if the INT value was not \nupdated. However , if the INT value has changed , this incorrect \nN counter value can cause  the PLL to overshoot in  frequency \nwhile it tries to lock to the temporarily incorrect N counter value . \nAfter  the correct fractiona l value is loaded,  the PLL quickly lock s \nto the correct frequency.  Introducing an additional delay to the \nloading of the  INT value using the N SEL bit cause s the INT and \nFRAC values  to be  loaded at the same time , preventing  frequency  \novershoot. The delay i s turned on by setting Bit DB15 to 1.  Σ-Δ Reset  \nFor most applications, Bit DB14 should be set to 0. When this bit is \nset to 0, the Σ -Δ modulator is reset on  each write to Register R 0. \nIf it is not required that the Σ -Δ modulator be reset on each write  \nto Register R0, set this bit to 1.  \nRamp Mo de \nBits DB[11:10]  determine the type of generated waveform  (see \nFigure 28 and the Waveform Generation  section).  \nPSK Enable  \nWhen Bit DB9 is set to 1, PSK modulation is enabled. When \nthis bit is set to  0, PSK modulation is disabled. F or more infor -\nmation , see the Phase Shift Keying (PSK)  section . \nFSK Enable  \nWhen Bit DB8 is set to 1, FSK modulation is enabled. When \nthis bit is set to 0, FSK modulation is disabled. For more infor -\nmati on, s ee the Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)  section . \nLock Detect Precision (LDP)  \nThe digital lock detect circuit monitors the PFD up and down \npulses ( logical OR of the up and down pulses ; see Figure 21). \nEver y 32nd pulse is measured. The LDP bit ( Bit DB7) specifies \nthe length of each lock detect reference cycle.  \n• LDP = 0: if five  consecutive pulses of less than 14 ns are \nmeasured, digital lock detect is asserted.  \n• LDP = 1: if five  consecutive pulses of less than  6 ns are \nmeasured, digital lock detect is asserted.  \nDigital lock detect remains  asserted until the pulse width exceeds \n22 ns, a write to Register R0 occurs , or the part is powered down . \nFor more robust operation, set LDP = 1.  \nPhase Detector (PD) Polarity  \nBit DB6  sets the phase detector polarity. When the VCO \ncharacteristics are positive, set  this bit to 1. When the VCO \ncharacteristics are negative, set this bit to 0.  \nPower -Down  \nBit DB5 provides the programmable power -down mode. Setting \nthis bit to 1 perfor ms a power -down. Setting this bit to 0 returns \nthe synthesizer to normal operation. When the part is  in software  \npower -down mode, it  retains all information in its registers. T he \nregister contents are lost only when the supplies are removed.  \nWhen power -dow n is activated, the following events occur:  \n• All active dc current paths are removed.  \n• The RF synthesizer counters are forced to their load  \nstate conditions.  \n• The charge pump is forced into three -state mode.  \n• The digital lock  detect circuitry is reset.  \n• The RF IN input is debiased.  \n• The input shift register remains active and capable  \nof loading and latching data.  \nADF4159  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

To do  this, Bit DB31 must  be set to 1. \nSynchronization is done internally on the part.  \nΣ-Δ Modulator Mode  \nTo completely disable the Σ -Δ modulator, set Bits DB[30:26] to \n0b01110, which puts the ADF41 59 into integer -N mode, and  \nthe channel spacing becomes equal to the PFD frequency. Both \nthe 12 -bit MSB fractional value  (Register R0, DB[14:3]) and the \n13-bit LSB fractional value  (Register R1, DB[27:15]) must be set \nto 0. After writing to Register 4, Register 3 must be written to twice, \nto trigger a counter reset. (That is, write Register 3 with DB3 = 1,  \nthen write Register 3 with DB3 = 0.)  \nAll features driven by the Σ -Δ modulator  are disabled, such as \nramping, PSK, FSK, and phase adjust.   \nDisabling the Σ -Δ modulator also removes the fixed +(f PFD/226) \noffset on the VCO output.  \nFor normal operation, set these bits to 0b00000.  \nRamp Status  \nBits DB[25: 21] provide  access to the following advanced \nfeatures  (see Figure 29): • Readback to MUXOUT option: the synthesizer frequency \nat the moment of interruption  can be read back (see the \nInterrupt Modes and  Frequency Readback  section) . \n• Ramp complete to MUXOUT option: a logic high pulse  \nis output on the MUXOUT pin at the end of each ramp.  \n• Charge pump up and charge pump  down options: the \ncharge pump is forced to constantly output up or down  \npulse s, respectiv ely. \nWhen using the r eadback to MUXOUT or ramp complete  \nto MUXOUT option, the MUXOUT bits in Register R0  \n(Bits DB[30:27]) must be set to 1111.  \nClock  Divider  Mode  \nBits DB[20:19]  are used to enable Ramp Divider mode or Fast \nLock Divider mode. If neither is  being used, set these bits to 0b00.  \n12- Bit CLK 2 Divider Value  \nBits DB[18:7] program the clock divider  (the CLK 2 timer ) when \nthe part operat es in ramp mode  (see the Timeout Interval  section ). \nThe CLK 2 timer also determines how lo ng the loop remains in \nwideband mode wh en fast lo ck mode  is used  (see the Fast Lock \nMode  section ). \nClock  Divider Select \nWhen Bit DB6 is set to 0, CLK 2 is used as the CLK 2 value for a \nstandard ramp, such as sawtooth or triangular.

E | Page 25 of 36 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nINITIALIZATION SEQUE NCE  \nAfter powering  up the ADF4159, initialize the part by pro gram -\nming the registers in the  following sequence:  \n1. Delay register (R7).  \n2. Step register (R6). L oad the step register twice, first with \nSTEP SEL = 0 and then with STEP SEL = 1 . \n3. Deviation  register (R5). L oad the deviation register twice, \nfirst with  DEV SEL = 0  and then with  DEV SEL = 1 . \n4. Clock  register (R4). L oad the clock register twice, first with  \nCLK DIV SEL = 0 and then with  CLK DIV SEL = 1 . \n5. Function register (R3).  \n6. R divider register (R2).  \n7. LSB FRAC register (R1).  \n8. FRAC/INT register (R0) . \nRF SYNTHESIZER WORKE D EXAMPLE  \nThe following equation governs how the synthesizer must   \nbe programmed.  \nRF OUT = (INT + (FRAC/225)) × fPFD (4) \nwhere:  \nRF OUT is the RF frequency output.  \nINT is the integer division factor.  \nFRAC  is the fractionality.  \nThe PFD  frequency (f PFD) equation  is \nfPFD = REF IN × [(1 + D )/(R × (1 +  T))] (5) \nwhere:  \nREF IN is the reference frequency input.  \nD is the RF REF IN doubler bit , Bit DB20 in Register R2 (0 or 1).  \nR is the RF reference division factor  (1 to 32).  \nT is the reference divide -by-2 bit, Bit DB21 in Register R2  (0 or 1).  \nFor example, in a system where a 12.102  GHz RF frequency \noutput (RF OUT) is required and a 10 0 MHz reference frequency \ninput (REF IN) is available, the frequency resolution is  \nfRES = REF IN/225 (6) \nfRES = 100  MHz /225 = 2.98 Hz  \nFrom Equat ion 5 , \nfPFD = [100 MHz × (1 + 0)/1] = 10 0 MHz  \n12.102 GHz = 1 00 MHz × ( N + FRAC/225) \nCalculating the N and FRAC values,  \nN = int(RF OUT/fPFD) = 121 \nFRAC  = FMSB × 213 + FLSB \nFMSB = int(((RF OUT/fPFD) − N ) × 212) = 81  \nFLSB = int(((((RF OUT/fPFD) − N ) × 212) − F MSB) × 213) = 7536 \nwhere:  \nFMSB is the 12 -bit MSB FRAC value in Register R0.  \nFLSB is the 13 -bit LSB FRAC value in Register R1.  \nint() makes an integer of the argument in parentheses . REFERENCE DOUBLER  \nThe on-chip reference doubler allows the input reference si gnal to  \nbe doubled. This doubling is useful for increasing the PFD compar -\nison frequency. Doubling the PFD frequency usually improves \nthe noise performance of the system by 3  dB. It is important to \nnote that the PFD cannot be operated above 110  MHz due to a \nlimitation in the speed of the Σ -Δ circuit of the N divider . \nCYCLE SLIP R EDUCTION FOR FASTER LOCK TIMES  \nIn fast lo cking applications, a wide loop filter bandwidth is \nrequired for fast frequency acquisition, resulting in increased \nintegrated phase noise a nd reduced spur attenuation. Using cycle \nslip reduction, the loop bandwidth can be kept narrow to reduce  \nintegrated phase noise and attenuate spurs while still realizing fast  \nlock times.  \nCycle Slips  \nCycle slips occur in integer -N/fractional -N synthesizers when the \nloop bandwidth is narrow compared with the PFD frequency. The  \nphase error at the PFD inputs accumulates too fast for the PLL to  \ncorrect, and the charge pump temporarily pumps in the wrong \ndirection, slowing down the loc k time dramatically. The ADF4159 \ncontains a cycle slip reduction circuit to extend the linear range of the PFD, allowing faster lock times without loop filter changes.  \nWhen the ADF4159 detects that a cycle slip is about to occur, it \nturns on an extra charge pump current cell. This outputs a constant  \ncurrent to the loop filter or removes a constant current from the loop filter (depending on whether the VCO tuning vo ltage must  \nincrease or decrease to acquire the new frequency). The effect is that the linear range of the PFD is increased. Stability is maintained  \nbecause the current is constant and is not a pulsed current.  \nIf the phase error increases again to a point w here another cycle \nslip is likely, the ADF4159 turns on another charge pump cell. This  \ncontinues until the ADF4159 detects that the VC O frequency has  \nexceeded  the desired frequency. It then begins to turn off the \nextra charge pump cells one by one until they are all turned off and the frequency is settled.  \nUp to seven extra charge pump cells can be turned on. In most applications, seven cells is enough to eliminate cycle slips alto -\ngether, giving much faster lock times.  \nWhen  Bit DB28 in the R  divider register (Register R2)  is set  to 1, \ncycle slip reduction  is enabled . Note that a 45% to 55% duty cycle  \nis needed on the signal at the PFD in  order for CSR to operate \ncorrectly. The reference divide- by-2 flip -flop can help to provide  \na 50% duty cycle at the PFD. For example, if a 100 MHz reference  \nfrequency is available and the user wants to run t he PFD at \n10 MHz, setting the R  divide factor to 10 results in a 10  MHz PFD \nsignal that is not 50% duty cycle. By setting the R  divide factor \nto 5 and enabling the reference divide- by-2 bit, a 50% duty cycle \n10 MHz signal can be achieved.  \n \nADF4159 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 26 of 36 Note that the cycle slip reduction feature can only be operated \nwhen the phase detector polarity setting is positive (Bit DB6 in Register R3 is set to 1). It cannot be used if the phase detector \npolarity is negative. \nMODULATION \nThe ADF4159  can operate in frequency shift keying (FSK) or \nphase shift keying (PSK) mode. \nFrequency Shift Keying (FSK) \nFSK is implemented by configuring the ADF4159  N divider  \nfor the center frequency and then toggling the TX DATA pin.  \nThe deviation from the center frequency is set by \nfDEV = (fPFD/225) × (DEV  × 2DEV_OFFSET) (7) \nwhere: \nfPFD is the PFD frequency. \nDEV is a 16-bit word (Bits DB[18:3] in Register R5). \nDEV_OFFSET is a 4-bit word (Bits DB[22:19] in Register R5). \nThe ADF4159  implements f DEV by incrementing or decrementing \nthe configured N divider value by DEV × 2DEV_OFFSET. \nFSK Settings Worked Example \nIn this example, an FSK system operates at 5.8 GHz with a 25 MHz f\nPFD, requiring 250 kHz deviation (f DEV). \nRearrange Equation 7 as follows: \n(DEV  × 2DEV_OFFSET) = f DEV/(fPFD/225) \n(DEV  × 2DEV_OFFSET) = 250 kHz/(25 MHz/225) \n(DEV  × 2DEV_OFFSET) = 335,544.32 \nIf DEV_OFFSET is set to 6, \nDEV  = 335,544.32/(26) = 5242.88 ≈ 5243 \nDue to the rounding of DEV , fDEV = 250.005722 kHz. \nToggling the TX DATA pin causes the frequency to hop between \n±250 kHz from the programmed center frequency. \nPhase Shift Keying (PSK) \nWhen the ADF4159  is configured for PSK mode, the output \nphase of the ADF4159 is equal to \n(Phase Value × 360°)/212 \nThe phase value is set in Register 1, Bits DB[14:3]. The PSK modulation is controlled by the TX\nDATA pin. \nFor example, if the phase value is 1024, a logic high on the TX DATA \npin results in a 90° increase of the output phase. A logic low on the TX\nDATA pin results in a 90° decrease of the output phase. The \npolarity can be inverted by negating the phase value. \n   \n WAVEFORM GENERATION \nThe ADF4159  is capable of generating five types of waveforms \nin the frequency domain: single ramp burst, single triangular \nburst, single sawtooth burst, continuous sawtooth ramp, and continuous triangular ramp. Figure 33 through Figure 37 show the types of waveforms available.  \nFREQUENC Y\nTIME\n10849-028\n \nFigure 33. Single Ramp Burst FREQUENC Y\nTIME\n10849-029\n \nFigure 34.

Waveform Timing  \nThe key parameters that define a ramp are  \n• Frequency deviation  \n• Timeout interval  \n• Number of steps  \nFrequency Deviation  \nThe frequency deviat ion for ea ch frequency hop is set by  \nfDEV = (fPFD/225) × (DEV  × 2DEV_OFFSET) (7) \nwhere:  \nfPFD is the PFD frequency.  \nDEV is a 16 -bit word  (Bits DB[18:3] in Register R5) . \nDEV_OFFSET is a 4 -bit word  (Bits DB[22:19] in Register R5) . \nTimeout Interval  \nThe time be tween each frequency hop is set by  \nTimer  = CLK 1 × CLK 2 × (1/ fPFD) (8) \nwhere:  \nCLK 1 and CLK 2 are the 12-bit clock values (12 -bit CLK 1 divider in  \nRegister R2 and  12-bit CLK 2 divider  in Register R4). Bits  DB[20:19]  \nin Register R4 must be set to 11 for ramp div ider.  \nfPFD is the PFD frequency . \nEither CLK 1 or CLK 2 must be greater than 1, that is, CLK 1 = \nCLK 2 = 1 is not allowed.  \nNumber of Steps  \nA 20- bit step value (Bits DB[22:3] in Register R6) defines the \nnumber of frequency hops that take place. The INT value can not \nbe incremented by more than 28 = 256 from its starting value.  \nSINGLE RAMP BURST  \nThe most basic waveform is the single ramp burst. All other \nwaveforms are variations of  this waveform . In the single ramp \nburst, the ADF4159 is locked to the frequency defined in the \nFRAC/ INT register  (R0). When the ramp mode is enabled, the \nADF4159 increments the N  divider value by DEV × 2DEV_OF FSET, \ncausing a frequency shift , fDEV, on each timer interval. This shift \nis repeated  until the set number of steps has taken place. The \nADF4159 then retain s the final N  divide r value.  \n \n SINGLE TRIANGULAR  BURST  \nThe single triangular burst is similar to the single ramp burst. \nHowever, when the steps are  completed, the ADF4159 begins  \nto decrement the N  divide r value by DEV × 2DEV_OFFSET on each \ntimeout interval . \nSINGLE SAWTOOTH BURS T \nIn the single sawtooth burst, the N divide r value is reset to it s \ninitial value on the next timeout interval after the number of \nsteps has taken place. The AD F4159 retains this N  divide r value.  \nSAWTOOTH RAMP  \nThe sawtooth ramp is a repe ated version of the single saw tooth \nburst. The waveform is repeat ed until the ramp is disabled.  \nTRIANGULAR RAMP  \nThe triangular ramp is  a repeated version of the single trian gu-\nlar burst. However , when the steps are  completed, the ADF4159  \nbegins  to decrement the N  divide r value by DEV × 2DEV_OFFSET on \neach timeout interval. When the number of steps has again been  \ncomplete d, the part  reverts to incrementing the N  divide r value. \nRepeating this pattern creates a triangular waveform. The wave -\nform is repeated until the ramp is disabled.  \nFMCW RADAR RAMP SETTINGS WORKED EXAMPLE  \nThis  example describes a frequency modulated contin uous wave  \n(FMCW) radar system that requires  the RF LO to use a sawtooth  \nramp over a 50  MHz range every 2 ms. The PFD frequency is \n25 MHz, and the RF output range is 5800 MHz to 5850 MHz.  \nThe frequency deviation for each hop in the ramp is  set to \n~250 kHz.  \nThe frequency resolution of  the ADF4159 is calculated  \nas follows:  \nfRES = fPFD/225 (9) \nUsing Equation 9 , fRES is calculated as follows:  \nfRES = 25 MHz/225 = 0.745 Hz  \nDEV_OFFSET is calculated after  rearranging Equation 7. \nDEV_OFFSET  = log 2(fDEV/(fRES × DEV MAX)) (10) \nExpressed in log 10(x), Equation 10 can be rearranged  into  \nthe following  equation:  \nDEV_OFFSET  = log 10(fDEV/(fRES × DEV MAX))/log 10(2) (11) \nwhere:  \nfDEV is the frequency deviation . \nDEV MAX = 215 (maximum value of the d eviation word). \nDEV_OFFSET  is a 4-bit word.  \nUsing Equation 11, DEV_OFFSET is calculated as follows:  \nDEV_OFFSET  = log 10(250 kHz/ (0.745 Hz × 215))/log 10(2) = 3.356 \nAfter rounding , DEV_OFFSET = 4 . \n \nADF4159  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 28 of 36 From DEV_OFFSET , the resolution of  the frequency deviati on \ncan be calculated as follows:  \nfDEV_RES  = fRES × 2DEV_OFFSET (12) \nfDEV_RES  = 0.745 Hz  × 24 = 11.92 Hz  \nTo calculate the DEV word , use  Equation 1 3. \nDEV  = fDEV/(fRES × 2DEV_OFFSET) (13) \n52.971,20\n2\n2MHz25zkH250\n4\n25=\n×= DEV  \nRounding this value to 20,972 and recalculating using Equation 7 \nto obtain  the actual deviation frequency , fDEV, thus produces the \nfollowing:  \nfDEV = (25  MHz/225) × (20 ,972 × 24) = 250.006 kHz \nThe number of f DEV steps required to cover the 50  MHz range  \nis 50  MHz/250.006 kHz = 20 0. To cover the 50  MHz range in \n2 ms, the ADF4159 must hop every 2  ms/200 = 10 µs.  \nRearrang e Equation 8 to set the timer value (and  set CLK 2 to 1):  \nCLK 1 = Timer  × fPFD/CLK 2 = 10 µs × 25 MHz/1 = 250  \nTo summarize  the settings,  \n• DEV = 20 ,972 \n• Number of steps = 200 \n• CLK 1 = 250  \n• CLK 2 = 1 (Bits DB[20:19] = 11, ramp divider , in Register R4 ) \nUsing these settings, program the ADF4159 to a cent er frequency  \nof 5800 MHz  and enabl e the sawtooth ramp to produce the \nrequired waveform. If a triangular ramp is  used with the same \nsettings, the ADF4159 sweep s from 5800  MHz to 5850 MHz and  \nback down a gain , taking 4  ms for t he entire sweep.  \nACTIVATING THE RAMP  \nAfter setting all required  parameters , the ramp must be activated by  \nchoosing the desired type of ramp ( Bits DB[11:10] in Register R3) \nand starting the ramp ( Bit DB31 = 1 in Reg ister R0). \nRamp Pro gramming Sequence  \nThe setting of parameters described in the FMCW Radar Ramp \nSettings Worked Example  section and the activation of the ramp  \ndescribed in the Activating the Ramp  section  must  be completed  \nin the following register write order:  \n1. Delay register (R7)  \n2. Step register (R6)  \n3. Deviation register (R5)  \n4. Clock  register (R4)  \n5. Function register (R3)  \n6. R divider register (R2)  \n7. LSB FRAC register (R1)  \n8. FRAC/INT register (R0)  \n \n OTHER  WAVEFORMS  \nDual Ramp s with Differ ent Ramp  Rates  \nThe ADF4159 can be configured for  two ramps with different \nstep and deviation settings. It also allows the ramp rate to be \nreprogrammed  while another ramp is running.  \nExample  \nIn th is example, the PLL is locked to 5790 MHz and  \nfPFD = 25 MHz . Two ramps are configured, as follows:  \n• Ramp 1 jumps 100 steps ; each step lasts 10  µs and has a \nfrequency deviation of 100 kHz.  \n• Ramp 2 jumps 80 steps; each step lasts 10 µs and has a \nfrequency dev iation of 125 kHz.  \nTo enable the two ramp rates , follow these steps: \n1. Activate the dual ramp  rates mode  by setting Bit DB24  \nin Register R5 to 1 . \n2. Program  the ramp rate for Ramp 1  by setting the following \nvalues:  \n• Register R5 : set Bit DB23 = 0, Bits DB[18:3] = 16, 777, \nand Bits DB[22:19] = 3  \n• Register R6:  set Bit DB2 3 = 0 and Bits DB[22:3] = 100  \n3. Program the ramp rate for Ramp 2  by setting the following \nvalues:  \n• Register R5 : set Bit DB23 = 1, Bits DB[18:3] = 20, 972, \nand Bits DB[22:19] = 3  \n• Register R6:  set Bit DB23  = 1 and Bits DB[22:3] = 80  \nFigure  39 shows t he resulting ramp with two ramp  rates .

E | Page 29 of 36 Ramp Mode with Superimposed FSK Signal  \nIn traditional approaches , FMCW radars use  either linear \nfrequency modulation (LFM ) or FSK modulation. Used sepa -\nrately, these modu lations introduce ambiguity between measured  \ndistance and velocit y, especially in multitarget situations. To over -\ncome this issue and enable unambiguous ( distance and velocity) \nmultitarget detection, use a ramp with FSK superimposed on it.  \nExample  \nIn this  example, the PLL is locked to 5790 MHz and f PFD = \n25 MHz . The ram p with superimposed FSK is configured as \nfollows:  \n• The number of steps is set to  100; each step lasts 10  µs  \nand has a deviation of 100 kHz.  \n• The FSK signal is 25 kHz.  \nTo enable ramp mode with FSK superimposed  on it , follow \nthese steps : \n1. Set Bit DB23 in Regis ter R5 and Bit DB23 in Register R6  \nto 0.  \n2. Program the ramp as described in the FMCW Radar Ramp \nSettings Worked Example  section . \n3. Program FSK on the ramp to 25 kHz  by setting  the bits in \nRegister R5 as follows:  \n• DB[18:3] = 4194 (dev iation word)  \n• DB[22:19] = 3 (deviation offset  word ) \n• DB23 = 1 (deviation word  for FSK on  the ramp)  \n• DB25 = 1 (ramp with FSK e nabled)  \nFigure 40 shows a n example of a ramp with FSK  superimposed \non it.

The \ndelay is calculated as follows:  \nDelay  = tPFD × Delay Start Word   \nDelay  = 40 ns × 125 = 5 µs \n3. Delay the ramp on the second part by 125 µs  by setting   \nBit DB16 in Register R 7 to 1 and setting  the 12 -bit delay \nstart word ( Bits DB[14:3] in Register R 7) to 125.

The de lay is calculated \nas follows:  \nDelay  = tPFD × Delay Start Word   \nDelay  = 40 ns × 125 = 5 µs \nIf a longer delay is needed, for example,  125 µs, set Bit DB16 in  \nRegister R7 to 1 , and set the 12 -bit delay start word  (Bits DB[14:3] \nin Register R 7) to 125. The d elay is calculated as follows:  \nDelay  = tPFD × CLK 1 × Delay Start Word   \nDelay  = 40 ns × 25 × 125 = 125 µs \n \n \n It is also possible  to activate fast lo ck operation for the first \nperiod of delay  by setting Bit DB18 in Register  R7 to 1. This \nfeature is useful for sawtooth ramps to mitigate the frequency \novershoot on the transition from one sawtooth to the next.  \nTo activate the ramp, see the Activati ng the Ramp  section . \nDual  Ramp Rates Mode with Delay  \nThis mode combines the  modes described in the  Dual Ramp s \nwith Different Ramp  Rates  section and the  Delay Between \nRamps  section  (see Figure 45). \n10849-140 TIMEFREQUENCY\n \nFigure 45.

In this mode , the \ncharge pump current is boosted and additional resistors are \nconnected to m aintain the stability of the loop.  \nFast  Lock Timer and Register Sequences  \nWhen fast lock mode is enabled (Register R4, DB[20:19]), after \na write to Register R0, the PLL operates in a wide bandwidth mode for a selected amount of time. Before fast lock is en abled, \nthe initialization sequence must be performed after the part is first powered up (see the Initialization Sequence  section). The \ntime in bandwidth mode is set by:  \nCLK\n1 × CLK 2 / fPFD = Time in wide bandwidth  \nwhere:  \nCLK 1 = Reg ister R2, DB[14:3].  \nCLK 2 = Register R4, DB[18:7].  \nfPFD = the PFD frequency.  \nNote that the fast lock feature does not work in ramp mode.  \nFast Lock Example  \nIn this example, the  PLL has f PFD of 100 MHz and requires being \nin wide bandwidth mode for 12 µs.  \nCLK 1 × CLK 2 / fPFD = 12 µs  \nCLK 1 × CLK 2 = (12 × 10−6)(100 × 106) = 1200 \nTherefore, CLK1 = 12 and CLK2 = 100, which results in 12 µs.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Fast Lock Loop Filter Topology  \nTo use fast lo ck mode, an extra connection from the PLL to the \nloop filter is needed. The damping resistor in the loop fil ter must  \nbe reduced to ¼ of its value in wide bandwidth mode. This reduc -\ntion is required because the charge pump current is increased \nby 16 in wide ban dwidth mode, and stability must be ensured.  \nTo further enhance stability and mitigate frequency oversho ot \nduring a  frequency change in wide bandwidth mode, Resistor R3  \nis connected  (see Figure 53). During fast lock, the SW1 pin is \nshorted to ground , and the SW2 pin is connected to CP (set  \nBits DB[2 0:19] in Register R4 to 01 for fast lock divider ). \nThe following two topologies can be used:  \n• Divide the damping resistor (R1) into two values (R1 and \nR1A) that have a ratio of 1:3 (see Figure 53). \n• Connect an extra resistor (R1A) directly from SW1  (see \nFigure 54). The extra resistor must be selected  such that the \nparallel combination of an extra resistor and the damping resistor (R1) is reduced to ¼ of the original value of R1.  \nFor both topologies, the ratio R3:R2 must  equal 1:4.  \n10849-047ADF4159SW2\nSW1CP\nC1 C2\nR1\nR1AR3\nR2\nC3VCO\n \nFigu re 53.

E | Page 34 of 36 SPUR  MECHANISMS  \nThe fractional interpolator in the ADF4159 is a third -order Σ -Δ \nmodulator with a 25- bit fixed modulus (MOD). The Σ -Δ modu -\nlator is clocked at the PFD reference rate (f PFD), which allows PLL  \noutput frequencies to be synthesized at a channel step resolution  \nof f PFD/CLK 1. This section describes the various spur mechanisms  \nthat are possible with fractional -N synthesizers and how they \naffect the ADF4159.  \nFractional Spurs  \nIn most fractional synthesizers, fractional spurs can appear  \nat the set channel spacing of the synthesizer. In the ADF4159, \nthese spurs do not appear. The high value of the fixed modulus in the ADF4159 make s the Σ-Δ modulator  quantization error \nspectrum look like broadband noise, effectively spreading the fractional spurs into noise.  \nInteger Boundary Spurs  \nInteractions between the RF VCO frequency and the PFD \nfrequency can lead to spurs known as integer boun dary spurs. \nWhen these frequencies are not integer related (which is the \npurpose of a  fractional -N synthesizer), spur sidebands appear \non the VCO output spectrum at an offset frequency that corre -\nsponds to the beat note , or difference frequency , between an  \ninteger multiple of the PFD and the VCO frequency.  \nThese spurs are called  integer boundary spurs because they are \nmore noticeable on channels close to integer multiples of the PFD , \nwhere the difference frequency can be inside the loop bandwidth.  \nThese sp urs are attenuated by the loop filter  on channels far from  \ninteger multiples of the PFD . \nReference Spurs  \nReference spurs are generally not a problem in fractional -N \nsynthesizers because the reference offset is far outside the loop bandwidth. However, any r eference feedthrough mechanism \nthat bypasses the loop can cause a problem. One such mecha -\nnism is the feedthrough of low levels of on -chip reference switching  \nnoise out through the RF\nINx pins back to the VCO, resulting in \nreference spur levels as high as −90 dBc.  Take c are in the PCB \nlayout to ensure that the VCO is well separated from the input \nreference to avoid a possible feedthrough path on the board.  Low Frequency Applications  \nThe specification o f the RF input is 0.5 GHz minimum; however,  \nRF frequenci es lower than 0.5 GHz can be used if  the minimum \nslew rate specification of 400 V /µs is met. An appropriate driver —\nfor example, the ADCMP553— can be used to accelerate the edge \ntransitions of the  RF signal before it is fed back to the ADF4159 \nRF input.  \nFILTER DESIGN  USING ADI sim PLL  \nA filter design and analysis program is avai lable to help the user \nimplement PLL design. Visit http://www.analog.com/pll  to down -\nload the free ADIsimPLL ™ software. This  software de signs, \nsimulates, and analyzes the entire PLL frequency domain and \ntime domain response. Various passive and active fi lter arch i-\ntectures are allowed.  \nPCB DESIGN GUIDELINE S FOR THE CHIP SCALE  \nPACKAGE  \nThe lands on the chip scale package (CP -24-10) are recta ngular. \nThe printed circuit board (PCB) pad for thes e lands must  be \n0.1 mm longer than the package land length and 0.05 mm wider \nthan the package land width. Center t he land on the pad  to ensure  \nthat the solder joint size is maximized.  \nThe bottom of the ch ip scale package has a central exposed \nthermal pad. The thermal pad on the PCB must  be at least as \nlarge as this exposed pad. On the PCB , there must be a clearance  \nof at least 0.25 mm between the thermal pad and the inner edges  \nof the pad pattern to  ensure  that shorting is avoided.  \nThermal vias can be used on the PCB thermal pad to improve \nthe thermal performance of the package. If vias are used, incor -\nporate  them  into the thermal pad at the 1.2 mm pitch grid. The \nvia dia meter must  be between 0.3 mm and 0.3 3 mm, and the  \nvia barrel must  be plated with 1 ou nce of copper to plug the via. \nConnect the PCB thermal pad to AGND.  \n \n  \n \nData Sheet  ADF4159  \n \nRev.

In the FMCW  \nradar system, t he ADF4159 is used to generate  the sawtooth or \ntriangle ramps that are necessary for this type of radar t o operate.  \nTraditionally, the PLL was driven directly by a direct digital \nsynthesizer (DDS) to gen erate the required type of wave form.  Due \nto the wavefo rm generating mechanism that is implemented on \nthe ADF4159, a DDS is no lon ger needed, which reduces cost.  The PLL solution also has advantages over another method for \ngenerating FMCW ramps: a DA C driving the VCO directly ; this \nmethod  suffer s from nonlinearities of the VCO tuning character -\nistics , requiring compensation.
