A Darlington con-\nfiguration featuring one-micron emitters provides high FT and excellent thermal per-\nformance. The heterojunction increases breakdown voltage and minimizes leakagecurrent between junctions. Cancellation of emitter junction non-linearities results in\nhigher suppression of intermodulation products. At 850MHz and 35mA, the\nSGA3286Z typically provides +12.2dBm of  1dB compressed power using a single\npositive voltage supply.
