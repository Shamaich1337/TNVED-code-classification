This is a \nstress rating only; functional operation of the product at these \nor any other conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this sp ecification is not implied. \nOperation beyond the maximum operating conditions for \nextended periods may affe ct product reliability. \nTHERMAL DATA \nAbsolute maximum ratings appl y individually only, not in \ncombination. The ADP150 can be  damaged when the junction \ntemperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature \ndoes not guarantee that T J is within the specified temperature \nlimits. In applications with high power dissipation and poor \nthermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature may have to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low printed \ncircuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum ambient \ntemperature can exceed the maximum limit as long as the junction \ntemperature is within specification limits. The junction \ntemperature (T\nJ) of the device is dependent on the ambient \ntemperature (T A), the power dissipation of the device (P D), and \nthe junction-to-ambient thermal resistance of the package (θ JA).  \nMaximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated from the \nambient temperature (T A) and power dissipation (P D) by \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) \n The junction to ambient thermal resistance (θ JA) of the package \nis based on modeling and a calculation using a 4-layer board. \nThe junction to ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on the application and board layout. In applications where high \nmaximum power dissipation exists, close attention to thermal \nboard design is required. The value of θ\nJA can vary, depending on \nPCB material, layout, and environmental conditions. The specified \nvalues of θ JA are based on a 4-layer, 4 inch × 3 inch circuit board. \nRefer to JESD 51-7 and JESD 51-9 for detailed information \non the board construction. For additional information, see the \nAN-617 Application Note , Wafer Level Chip Scale Package .  \nΨJB is the junction-to-board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W. Ψ JB of the package is based on modeling \nand a calculation using a 4-layer board. The JESD51-12, \nGuidelines for Reporting and Using Package Thermal Information , \nstates that thermal characterization parameters are not the same as \nthermal resistances. Ψ JB measures the component power flowing \nthrough multiple thermal paths rath er than a single path as in \nthermal resistance, θ JB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths include \nconvection from the top of the package as well as radiation from \nthe package, factors that make Ψ JB more useful in real-world \napplications. Maximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated \nfrom the board temperature (T B) and power dissipation (P D) by  \nTJ = TB + (PD × Ψ JB) \nRefer to JESD51-8 and JESD51-12 for more detailed information \nabout Ψ JB. \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE \nθJA and Ψ JB are specified for the worst- case conditions, that is, a \ndevice soldered in a circuit board for surface-mount packages. \nTable 4.

D | Page 11 of 19 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADP150 is an ultralow noise, low quiescent current, low \ndropout linear regulator that operates from 2.2 V to 5.5 V and \ncan provide up to 150 mA of output current. Drawing a low 220 μA of quiescent current (typical) at full load makes the ADP150 \nideal for battery-operated port able equipment. Shutdown \ncurrent consumption is typically 200 nA. \nUsing new innovative design te chniques, the ADP150 provides \nsuperior noise performance for noise sensitive analog and  \nRF applications without the need  for a noise bypass capacitor. \nThe ADP150 is also optimized for use with small 1 μF ceramic capacitors. \nVOLTAGE\nREFERENCESHORT CIRCUIT,\nUVLO, AND\nTHERMAL\nPROTECT\nSHUTDOWNR1\nR2VOUT VIN\nGND\nEN\n08343-025 \nFigure 26. Internal Block Diagram \n Internally, the ADP150 consists of a reference, an error amplifier, \na feedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass transistor. Output \ncurrent is delivered via the PMOS pass device that is controlled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference \nvoltage with the feedback voltage from the output and amplifies \nthe difference. If the feedback voltage is lower than the reference \nvoltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled lower, allowing \nmore current to pass and increasing the output voltage. If the feedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of \nthe PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing less current to pass \nand decreasing the output voltage.  \nThe ADP150 is available in 14 ou tput voltage options, ranging \nfrom 1.8 V to 3.3 V. The ADP150 uses the EN pin to enable and \ndisable the VOUT pin under normal operating conditions. When \nEN is high, VOUT turns on, and when EN is low, VOUT turns \noff. For automatic startup, EN can be tied to VIN. \n  \n \n   \n \nADP150 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 12 of 19 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nOutput Capacitor \nThe ADP150 is designed for operation with small, space-saving \nceramic capacitors but functions with most commonly used \ncapacitors as long as care is taken with regard to the effective series resistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output capacitor \naffects the stability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of 1 μF \ncapacitance with an ESR of 1 Ω or less is recommended to \nensure the stability of the ADP 150. The transient response to \nchanges in load current is also affected by output capacitance. \nUsing a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient \nresponse of the ADP150 to large changes in the load current. \nFigure 27 and Figure 28 show the transient responses for output capacitance values of 1 μF and 4.7 μF, respectively. \nCH1  100mA CH2  50mV M1.0µs A  CH1       100mA\nT       716.000µs1\n2T\n08343-126IOUT\n1mA TO 150mA LOAD STEP\nVOUT\nVIN = 3.7V\nVOUT = 3.3V\n \nFigure 27.

Output Transient Response, C OUT = 4.7 μF \nInput Bypass Capacitor \nConnecting a 1 μF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the \ncircuit sensitivity to the PCB layout, especially when long input traces or high source impedance is encountered. If greater than \n1 μF of output capacitance is requ ired, increase the input capacitor \nto match the output capacitor.  Input and Output Capacitor Properties \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors  can be used with the ADP150, \nas long as they meet the minimum capacitance and maximum ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a \nvariety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature \nand applied voltage. Capacitors mu st have a dielectric adequate to \nensure the minimum capacitance over the necessary temperature \nrange and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a \nvoltage rating of 6.3 V or 10 V are recommended. Y5V and Z5U \ndielectrics are not recommended, due to their poor temperature \nand dc bias characteristics.  \nFigure 29 depicts the capacitance vs. the voltage bias characteristic \nof a 0402, 1 μF, 10 V, X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a \ncapacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage \nrating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage \nrating exhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the X5R dielectric is about ±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range and is not a function of package or voltage rating. \n1.2\n1.00.80.60.40.2\n0\n02468 1 0CAPACITANCE (µF)\nBIAS VOLTAGE (V)\n08343-100 \nFigure 29. Capacitance vs. Voltage Bias Characteristic \nUse Equation 1 to determine the worst-case capacitance, \naccounting for capacitor variatio n over temperature, component \ntolerance, and voltage. \nCEFF = CBIAS × (1 − TEMPCO ) × (1 − TOL ) (1) \nwhere: \nCBIAS is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage. \nTEMPCO  is the worst-case capacitor temperature coefficient. \nTOL  is the worst-case component tolerance. \nIn this example, the worst-case temperature coefficient (TEMPCO) \nover −40°C to +85°C is assumed to  be 15% for an X5R dielectric. \nThe tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed to be 10%, and the C\nBIAS is 0.94 μF at 1.8 V, as shown in Figure 29. \nSubstituting these values in Equation 1 yields \nCEFF = 0.94 μF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 0.719 μF \nTherefore, the capacitor chosen  in this example meets the \nminimum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temperature \nand tolerance at the chosen output voltage. \nData Sheet ADP150\n \nRev. D | Page 13 of 19 To guarantee the performance of the ADP150, it is imperative \nthat the effects of the dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on \nthe behavior of the capacitors be evaluated for each. \nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT \nThe ADP150 has an internal unde rvoltage lockout circuit that \ndisables all inputs and the output when the input voltage is less \nthan approximately 2.0 V. This ensures that the ADP150 inputs \nand output behave in a predictable manner during power-up. \nENABLE FEATURE \nThe ADP150 uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT pin under normal operating conditions. As shown in Figure 30, \nwhen a rising voltage on EN crosses the active threshold, V\nOUT \nturns on. When a falling voltage on EN crosses the inactive threshold, V\nOUT turns off. \n00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6\nVENVOUT\n08343-101 \nFigure 30. Typical EN Pin Operation  \nAs shown in Figure 30, the EN pi n has hysteresis built in. This \nprevents on/off oscillations that can occur due to noise on the EN pin as it passes through the threshold points.  \nThe EN pin active/inactive thresholds are derived from the VIN \nvoltage; therefore, these thresholds vary with changing input voltage.

Typical EN Pin Thresholds vs. Input Voltage (V IN) The ADP150 uses an internal soft start to limit the inrush current \nwhen the output is enabled.

Typical Start-Up Time  \nCURRENT LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADP150 is protected against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by current and thermal overload protection circuits. The ADP150 is designed  to limit current when the \noutput load reaches 260 mA (typ ical). When the output load \nexceeds 260 mA, the output voltag e is reduced to maintain a \nconstant current limit. \nThermal overload protection is in cluded, which limits the junction \ntemperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme \nconditions (that is, high ambient temperature and power dissipation) \nwhen the junction temperature st arts to rise above 150°C, the \noutput is turned off, reducing the output current to zero. When the junction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on again and the output current is  restored to its nominal value. \nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to GND occurs. \nAt first, the ADP150 limits cu rrent so that only 260 mA is \nconducted into the short. If self-heating of the junction is great \nenough to cause its temperature to rise above 150°C, thermal \nshutdown activates, turning off the output and reducing the \noutput current to zero. As the junction temperature cools and \ndrops below 135°C, the output turns on and conducts 260 mA into the short, again causing the junction temperature to rise \nabove 150°C. This thermal oscillation between 135°C and 150°C \ncauses a current oscillation between 260 mA and 0 mA that \ncontinues as long as the short remains at the output. \nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect \nthe device against accidental overload conditions. For reliable \noperation, device power dissipation must be externally limited so that the junction temperatures do not exceed 125°C. \nADP150 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 14 of 19 THERMAL CONSIDERATIONS \nIn most applications, the ADP150 does not dissipate much heat \ndue to its high efficiency. However, in applications with high ambient temperature and high supply voltage to output voltage \ndifferential, the heat dissipated in the package is large enough \nthat it can cause the junction te mperature of the die to exceed \nthe maximum junction temperature of 125°C. \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter \nenters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction \ntemperature decreases below 135 °C to prevent any permanent \ndamage. Therefore, thermal analysis  for the chosen application is \nvery important to guarantee reliable  performance over all conditions. \nThe junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient \ntemperature of the environment and the temperature rise of the \npackage due to the power dissipation, as shown in Equation 2. \nTo guarantee reliable operation,  the junction temperature of \nthe ADP150 must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the junction \ntemperature stays below 125°C, be aware of the parameters that \ncontribute to the junction temperature changes. These parameters include ambient temperature, power dissipation in the power \ndevice, and thermal resistances between the junction and \nambient air (θ\nJA). The θ JA number is dependent on the package \nassembly compounds that are used and the amount of copper \nused to solder the package GND pins to the PCB. Table 7 shows \ntypical θ JA values of the 5-lead TSOT  and 4-ball WLCSP packages \nfor various PCB copper sizes.
