This pin is NOT internally DC blocked. A DC blocking \ncapacitor, suitable for the frequency of operation, should be used \nin most applications.

For best performance, keep traces physically \nshort and connect immediately to ground plane.   \n3 RFOUT  RF output and bias pin. Biasing is accomplished with an external \nseries resistor and choke inductor to V CC. The resistor is selected \nto set the DC current into this pin to a desired level. The resistor \nvalue is determined by the following equation:  \n                 \n             \nCare should also be taken in the resistor selection to ensure that \nthe current into the part never exceeds maximum datasheet \noperating current over the planned operating temperature. This \nmeans that a r esistor between the supply and this pin is always \nrequired, even if a supply near 8.0V is available, to provide DC \nfeedback to prevent thermal runaway. Because DC is present on \nthis pin, a DC blocking capacitor , suitable for the frequency of \noperation, sho uld be used in most applications. The supply  side of \nthe bias network should also be well bypassed.   \n4 GND  Same as pin 2.   \n \nPackage Drawing  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nRF Micro Devices Inc .    7628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409 -9421   DS131004  \nFor sales or technical support, contact RFMD at +1.336.678.5570 or customerservice@rfmd.com . \nThe information in this publication is believed to be accurate.

Testing parameters for wafer -level sales of die material shall be negotiated \non a case -by-case basis.  \n\uf0b7 Segmented die are selected for customer shipment in accordance with RFMD Document #6000152 - Die Product Final \nVisual Inspection Criteria1. \n\uf0b7 Segmented die has a minimum sales volume of 100 pieces per order. A maximum of 400 die per carrier is allowable.  \n \nDie Packaging  \n\uf0b7 All die are pac kaged in GelPak ESD protective containers with the following specification: O.D.  = 2"X2", Capacity = 400 \nDie (20X20 segments), Retention Level = High(X0).  \n\uf0b7 GelPak  ESD protective containers are placed in a static shield bag. RFMD recommends that once the bag is opened the \nGelPak/s should be stored in a controlled nitrogen environment. Do not press on the cover of a closed GelPak, handle by \nthe edges only. Do not vac uum seal bags containing GelPak containers.  \n\uf0b7 Precaution must be taken to minimize vibration of packaging during handling, as die can shift during transit 2. \n \nPackage Storage  \n\uf0b7 Unit packages should be kept in a dry nitrogen environment for optimal assembly, pe rformance, and reliability.  \n\uf0b7 Precaution must be taken to minimize vibration of packaging during handling, as die can shift during transit2. \n \nDie Handling  \n\uf0b7 Proper ESD precautions must be taken when handling die material.  \n\uf0b7 Die should be handled using vacuum pic k-up equipment, or handled along the long side with a sharp pair of tweezers. Do \nnot touch die with any part of the body.  \n\uf0b7 When using automated pick -up and placement equipment, ensure that force impact is set correctly. Excessive force  \nmay damage GaAs devic es. \n \nDie Attach  \n\uf0b7 The die attach process mechanically attaches the die to the circuit substrate. In addition, the utilization of proper die \nattach processes electrically connect the ground to the trace on which the chip is mounted. It also establishes the thermal \npath by which heat can leave the chip.  \n\uf0b7 Die should be mounted to a clean, flat surface. Epoxy or eutectic die attach are both acceptable attachment methods. Top \nand bottom metallization are gold. Conductive silver -filled epoxies are recommended. Thi s procedure involves the use of \nepoxy to form a joint between the backside gold of the chip and the metallized area of the substrate.  \n\uf0b7 All connections should be made on the topside of the die. It is essential to performance that the backside be well \ngrounde d and that the length of topside interconnects be minimized.  \n\uf0b7 Some die utilize vias for effective grounding. Care must be exercised when mounting die to preclude excess run -out on \nthe topside.  \n \nDie Wire Bonding  \n\uf0b7 Electrical connections to the chip are made through wire bonds. Either wedge or ball bonding methods are acceptable \npractices for wire bonding.  \n\uf0b7 All bond wires should be made as short as possible.  \n \nNotes  \n1RFMD Document #6000152 - Die Product Final Visual In spection Criteria.
