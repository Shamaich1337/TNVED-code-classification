General description\nThe 74AVCH4T245 is a 4-bit, dual supply transceiver that enables bidirectional level translation.\nThe device can be used as two 2-bit transceivers or as a 4-bit transceiver. It features two 2-bit\ninput-output ports (nAn and nBn), a direction control input (nDIR), an output enable input (n OE)\nand dual supply pins (V CC(A)  and V CC(B) ). Both V CC(A)  and V CC(B)  can be supplied at any voltage\nbetween 0.8 V and 3.6 V making the device suitable for translating between any of the low voltage\nnodes (0.8 V, 1.2 V, 1.5 V, 1.8 V, 2.5 V and 3.3 V). Pins nAn, nOE and nDIR are referenced to\nVCC(A)  and pins nBn are referenced to V CC(B) . A HIGH on nDIR allows transmission from nAn to\nnBn and a LOW on nDIR allows transmission from nBn to nAn. The output enable input (n OE) can\nbe used to disable the outputs so the buses are effectively isolated.\nThe device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry\ndisables the output, preventing any damaging backflow current through the device when it is\npowered down. In suspend mode when either V CC(A)  or V CC(B)  are at GND level, both nAn and\nnBn outputs are in the high-impedance OFF-state. The bus hold circuitry on the powered-up side\nalways stays active.\nThe 74AVCH4T245 has active bus hold circuitry which is provided to hold unused or floating data\ninputs at a valid logic level. This feature eliminates the need for external pull-up or pull-down\nresistors.\n2.

    - SO16, TSSOP16, DHVQFN16: 500 mW
    - XQFN16: 250 mW

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +125 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - TSSOP16 (74AVCH4T245PW): Plastic thin shrink small outline package; 16 leads; body width 4.4 mm

- **Special Features:**
  - Bidirectional level translation

  - ESD protection: 
    - HBM: Exceeds 8000 V
    - CDM: Exceeds 1000 V
  - Complies with JEDEC standards for various voltage ranges

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level 1 (JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Description:**
The 74AVCH4T245 is a versatile transceiver that allows for the translation of logic levels between different voltage domains. It features two input-output ports (nAn and nBn), a direction control input (nDIR), and an output enable input (nOE). The device can be used in applications where different components operate at different voltage levels, ensuring compatibility and preventing damage.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Level Shifting:** Used in systems where components operate at different voltage levels, such as interfacing 3.3 V logic with 1.8 V or 2.5 V logic.
- **Data Communication:** Facilitates communication between devices with different voltage requirements in mixed-signal environments.
- **Microcontroller Interfacing:** Ideal for connecting microcontrollers with different operating voltages to sensors or other peripherals.
- **Power Management:** Can be used in power management circuits to ensure proper voltage levels are maintained across various components.

This component is particularly useful in modern electronic designs where low voltage operation is critical for power efficiency and device compatibility.
