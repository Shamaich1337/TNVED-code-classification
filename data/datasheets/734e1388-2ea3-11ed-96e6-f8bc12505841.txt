#### Description:
The BAS85 is a small signal Schottky diode designed for general-purpose applications. It features a low forward voltage drop, making it suitable for applications where efficiency is critical. The diode is constructed with a PN junction guard ring to protect against voltage spikes, such as those caused by electrostatic discharge.

#### Typical Applications:
The BAS85 is commonly used in:
- **Rectification**: Converting AC to DC in power supplies.
- **Signal Clipping**: Protecting sensitive components from voltage spikes.
- **Switching Applications**: Fast switching in digital circuits.
- **Low Voltage Applications**: Where a very low forward voltage is required, such as in RF applications and signal processing circuits.

This diode is particularly advantageous in scenarios where low power loss and high-speed operation are essential.
