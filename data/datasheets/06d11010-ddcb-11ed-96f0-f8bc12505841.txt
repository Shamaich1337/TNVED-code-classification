C | Page 18 of 32 TERMINOLOGY  \nLinearity Error or Integra l Nonlinearity ( INL)  \nLinearity error is defined as the maximum deviation of the \nactual analog output from the ideal output, determined by a \nstraight line drawn from zero  scale  to full scale.  \nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL)  \nDNL is the measure of the va riation in analog value, normal ized \nto full sc ale, associated with a 1 LSB change in digital input code.  \nMonotonicity  \nA DAC is monotonic if the output either  increases or remains \nconstant as  the digital input increases.  \nOffset Error  \nOffset error is t he deviatio n of the output current from the ideal \nof zero. For I OUTA, 0 mA output is expected when the inputs are \nall 0s. For I OUTB, 0 mA output is expected when all inputs are  \nset to 1s.  \nGain Error  \nGain error is the difference between the actual and ideal output \nspan. The actual span is determined by the difference between \nthe output when all inputs are set to 1s and the output when all \ninputs are set to 0s.  \nOutput Compliance Range  \nOutput compliance range is t he range of allowable voltage at  \nthe output of a current- output DAC. Operation beyond the \nmaximum compliance limits can cause either output stage \nsaturation or breakdown, resulting in nonlinear performance.  \nTemperature Drift  \nTemperature drift is specified as the maximum change from  the ambient ( 25°C) value to the value at either T\nMIN or T MAX.  \nFor offset and gain drift, the drift is reported in ppm of full -\nscale range (FSR) per degree Celsius. For reference drift, the \ndrift is reported in ppm per degree Celsius.  Power Supply Rejection  \nPower supply rejection  is the maximum change in the full -scale \noutput as the supplies are varied from minimum to maximum specified voltages.  \nSettling Time  \nSettling time is t he time required for the output to reach and \nremain within a specified error band a round  its final value, \nmeasured from the start of the output transition.  \nSpurious -Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)  \nSFDR is th e difference, in decibels , between the peak amplitude \nof the output signal and the peak spurious signal between dc \nand the frequency equal to half  the input data r ate. \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)  \nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of the first six harmonic com -\nponents to the rms value of the measured fundamental. It is \nexpressed as a percentage or in decibels.  \nSignal -to-Noise Ratio (SNR)  \nSNR is the ratio of the rms  value of the measured output signal \nto the rms sum of all other spectral components below the Nyqui st \nfrequency, excluding the first six harmonics and dc. The value \nfor SNR is expressed in decibels . \nAdjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) \nACLR is t he ratio in dBc between the measured power within a \nchannel relative to its adjacent channel.  \nComplex Image Rejection  \nIn a traditional two -part up conversion, two images are created \naround the second  IF frequency. These  images usually waste  \ntransmitter power and sys tem bandwidth. By placing the real \npart of a second  complex modulator in series with the first  \ncomplex modulator, either the upper or lower frequency image \nnear the second  IF can be rejected.  \n \nData Sheet AD9780/AD9781/AD9783  \n \nRev. C | Page 19 of 32 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe AD9780/AD9781/AD9783 have a combination of features \nthat make them very attractive for wired and wireless commu -\nnications systems. The dual DAC architecture facilitates easy interface to common quadrature modulators when designing \nsingle side band transmitters. In addition, the speed and \nperformance of the devices allow wider bandwidths and more \ncarriers to be synthesized than in previously available products.  \nAll features and options are software programmable through \nthe SPI port.  \nSERIAL PERIPHERAL IN TERFACE  \nAD9783\nSPI\nPORTSDO\nSDIO\nSCLK\nCSB\n06936-051 \nFigure 51. SPI Port  \nThe serial peripheral interface ( SPI) port is a flexible, synchron -\nous serial communications port allowing easy interface to many \nindustry -standard micro controllers and microprocessors. The \nport is compatible with most synchronous transfer for mats , \nincluding both the Motorola SPI and Intel ® SSR protocols.  \nThe interface allows read and write access to all registers that \nconfigure the AD9780/AD9781/AD9783. Single or multiple \nbyte transfers are supported as well as MSB -first or LSB -first \ntransfer formats. Serial data input/output can be accomplished \nthrough a single bidirectional pin (S DIO) or through two \nunidirectional pins (SDIO/SDO).  \nThe serial port configuration is controlled by Register 0x00,  \nBits[7:6]. It is important to note that any change made to the \nserial port configuration occurs immediately upon writing to the last bit of this byte. Therefore, it is possible with a multibyte transfer to write to this register and change the configuration in \nthe middle of a communication cycle. Care mus t be taken to \ncompensate for the new configuration within the remaining \nbytes of the current communication cycle.  \nUse of a single -byte transfer when changing the serial port \nconfiguration is recommended to prevent unexpected device behavior.  \nGENERAL OPERAT ION OF THE SERIAL INTERFACE  \nThere are two phases to any communication cycle with the \nAD9780/AD9781/AD9783: Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 is the \ninstruction cycle, which writes an instruction byte into the device. \nThis byte provides the serial port controller with information \nregarding Phase 2 of the communication cycle: the data transfer \ncycle. The Phase 1 instruction byte defines whether the upcoming \ndata transfer is  a read or write, the number of bytes in the data \ntransfer, and a reference register addres s for the firs t byte of the \ndata transfer. A l ogic high on the  CSB pin followed by a l ogic \nlow resets the SPI port to its initial state and defines the start of the instruction cycle. From this point, the next eight rising SCLK edges define the eight bits of the instruction byte for the \ncurrent communication cycle.  \nThe remaining S CLK edges are for Phase 2 of the communication \ncycle, which is the data transfer between the serial port contro ller \nand the system controller. Phase 2 can be a transfer of one , two, \nthree , or four  data bytes as determined by the instruction byte. \nUsing multibyte transfers is usually preferred , although single -\nbyte data transfers are useful to reduce CPU overhead or when \nonly a single register access is required.  \nAll serial port data  is transferred to and from the device in \nsynchronization with the SCLK pin. Input data is always latched \non the rising edge of SCLK , whereas output data is always valid \nafter the falling edge of SCLK. Register contents change imme -\ndiately upon writing to the last bit of each transfer byte.  \nAnytime synchronization is lost, the device has the ability to asynchronously terminate an I/O operation whenever the CSB pin  \nis taken to l ogic high. Any unwritten register content data is lo st \nif the I/O operation is ab orted. Taking CSB low then resets the \nserial port controller and restarts the communication cycle.  \nINSTRUCTION BYTE  \nThe instruction byte c ontai ns the information shown in Table 9. \nTable 9. \nMSB        LSB  \nB7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0 \nR/W  N1 N0 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 \nBit 7, R/W ,  determines whether a read or a write data transfer \noccurs after the instruction byte write. Logic 1  indicates a read \noperation. Logic 0 indicates a write operation.  \nBits[6:5], N1 and N0, determi ne the number of bytes to be \ntransferred during the data transfer cycle. The bits d ecode as \nshown in Table 10. \nTable 10. Byte Transfer Count  \nN1 N0 Description  \n0 0 Transfer one byte  \n0 1 Transfer two bytes  \n1 0 Transfer three bytes  \n1 1 Transfer four bytes  \nAD9780/AD9781/AD9783  Data Sheet \n \nRev. C | Page 20 of 32 Bits[4:0], A4, A3, A2, A1, and A0, determine which register is \naccessed during the data transfer of the communication cycle. \nFor multibyte transfers, this address is a starting or ending address dependi ng on the current data transfer mode. For \nMSB -first format, the specified address is an ending address  \nor the most significant address in the current cycle. Remaining \nregister addresses for multiple byte data transfers are generated \ninternally by the seri al port controller by decrementing from \nthe specified address. For LSB -first format, the specified address \nis a beginning address or the least significant address in the current cycle. Remaining register addresses for multiple byte \ndata transfers are gener ated internally by the serial port \ncontroller by incrementing from the specified address.  \nMSB/LSB TRANSFERS  \nThe serial port can support both MSB -first and LSB -first data \nformats. This functionality is controlled by Register 0x00, Bit 6. \nThe default is Logi c 0, which is MSB -first format.  \nWhen using MSB -first format (LSBFIRST = 0), the instruction \nand data bit must be written from MSB to LSB. Multibyte data \ntransfers in MSB -first format start with an instruction byte that \nincludes the register address of the most significant data byte. \nSubsequent data bytes are loaded into sequentially lower add ress \nlocations. In MSB -first mode, the serial port internal address \ngenerator decrements for each byte of the multibyte data \ntransfer.  \nWhen using LSB -first format (LSBF IRST = 1), the instruction \nand data bit must be written from LSB to MSB. Multibyte data \ntransfers in LSB -first format start with an instruction byte that \nincludes the register address of the least significant data byte. Subsequent data bytes are loaded int o sequentially higher \naddress locations. In LSB -first mode, the serial port internal \naddress generator increments for each byte of the multibyte  \ndata transfer.  \nUse of a single -byte transfer when changing the serial port data \nformat is recommended to preve nt unexpected device behavior.  \nSERIAL INTERFACE POR T PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \nChip Select Bar (CSB)  \nActive low input starts and gates a communication cycle. It \nallows more than one device to be used on the same serial \ncommunication lines. CSB must stay low during the entire \ncommunication cycle. Incomplete data transfers are aborted  \nanytime the CSB pin goes high. SDO and SDIO pins go to a \nhigh impedance state when this input is high.  \nSerial Clock (SCLK)  \nThe serial clock pin is used to synchronize data to and from t he \ndevice and to run the internal state machines. The maximum \nfrequency of SCLK is 40 MHz. All data input is registered on \nthe rising edge of SCLK. All data is driven out on the falling \nedge of SCLK.  Serial Port Data I/O (SDIO)  \nData is always written into the device on this pin. However, \nSDIO can also function as a bidirectional data output line. The \nconfiguration of this pin is controlled by Register 0x00, Bit 7. \nThe default is Logic 0, which configures the SDIO pin as \nunidirectional.  \nSerial Port Data Out put (SDO)  \nData is read from this pin for protocols that use separate lines \nfor transmitting and receiving data. The configuration of this \npin is controlled by Register 0x00, Bit 7. If this bit is set to a Logic 1, the SDO pin does not output data and is set  to a high \nimpedance state.  \n \nR/W N1 N0 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 D7D6ND5N D00 D10 D20 D30\nD7 D6ND5N D00 D10 D20 D30INSTRUCTION CYCLE DATATRANSFER CYCLE\nCSB\nSCLK\nSDIO\nSDO\n06936-052 \nFigure 52.

C | Page 25 of 32 PARALLEL DATA PORT I NTERFACE  \nThe parallel port data interface consists of  up to  18 differential \nsignals, DCO, DCI, and up to  16 data lines ( D[15:0] ), as shown \nin Figure 56. DCO is th e output clock generated by the AD9780 / \nAD9781/AD9783 that is used to clock out the data from the \ndigital data engine. The data  lines transmit the multip lexed  \nI and Q data words for the I and Q DACs, respectively. DCI \nprovides timing information about the parallel data and signals \nthe I/Q status of the data.  \nAs diagrammed  in Figure 56, the inco ming LVDS  data is \nlatched by an internally generated clock referred to as the data \nsampling signal ( DSS). DSS is a delayed version of the main \nDAC clock signal , CLKP/CLKN. Optimal positioning of the \nrising and falling edges of DSS with respect to the incoming \ndata signals results in the most robust transmission of the DAC \ndata. Pos itioning the edges of DSS with respect to the data  \nsignals is achieved by selecting the value of a programmable delay element, SMP . A procedure for determining the optimal \nvalue of SMP is given in the Optimizing the Parallel Port \nTiming  section.  \nIn addition to properly positioning the DSS edges, maximizing \nthe opening of the eye in the clock input (DCIP/DCIN)  and \ndata signals improves the reliability of the data port interface. \nThe two sources of degradation that reduce the eye in the clock \ninput and data  signals are the jitter on these signals and the \nskew between them. Therefore, it is recommended that the clock input signals be generated in the sam e manner as the data \nsignals with the same output driver and data line routing. In \nother words, it must  be implemented as a 17\nth data line with an \nalternating (010101 …) bit sequence.  \nFF\nFFD15:D0\nFFSET_DLY\nHLD_DLY\nSMP_DLYSEEK\nCLK DSSDDSSDDCIRETIMING\nAND\nDEMUXI DAC\nQ DAC\n06936-071CLOCK\nDISTRIBUTIONDCIP/DCIN\nDCOP/DCON\n \nFigure 56. Digital Data Port Block Diagram  OPTIMIZING THE PARAL LEL PORT TIMING  \nBefore outlining the procedure for determining the delay for \nSMP (that is, the positioning of DSS with respect to the data \nsignals), it is worthwhile to describe the simplified block \ndiagram of the digital data port. As can be seen in Figure 57, the \ndata signals are sampled on  the rising and falling edges of DSS. \nFrom there, the data is demultiplexed and retimed before being \nsent to the DACs.  \nThe clock input  signal provides timing information about the \nparallel data , as well as indicating the destination (that is, I DAC \nor Q D AC) of the data. A delayed version of DCI is generated \nby a delay element, SET, and is referred to as DDCI. DDCI is \nsampled by a delayed version of the DSS signal, labeled as DDSS \nin Figure 56. DDSS is simply DSS delayed by a peri od of time, \nHLD. The pair of delays, SET and HLD, allows accurate timing \ninformation to be extracted from the clock input . Increasing the \ndelay of the HLD block results in the clock input being sampled later in its cycle. Increasing the delay of the SET block results in \nthe clock input being sampled earlier in its cycle. The result of \nthis sampling is stored and can be queried by reading the SEEK \nbit. Because  DSS and the clock input signal are the same \nfrequency, the SEEK bit must  be a constant value. By va rying \nthe SET and HLD delay blocks and seeing the effect on the \nSEEK bit, the setup -and- hold timing of DSS with respect to \nclock input  (and , hence, data) can be measured.  \nI0 Q0 I1 Q1 I2 Q2\nSAMPLE 6 SAMPLE 5 SAMPLE 4 SAMPLE 3 SAMPLE 2 SAMPLE 1tHLD0DATA\nDCIP/DCIN\nDSS\n06936-072tHLD0\n \nFigure 57. Timing Diagram of Parallel Interface  \nThe increm ental units of SET, HLD, and SMP are in units of \nreal time, not fractions of a clock cycle. The nominal step size \nfor SET and HLD is 80 ps.  The nominal step size for SMP is \n160 ps. Note that the value of SMP refers to Register 0x05, \nBits[4:0], SET refers t o Register 0x04, Bits [7:4], and H LD refers \nto Register 0x04, Bits[3:0]. \nA procedure for configuring the device to ensure valid sampling of the data signals follows. Generally speaking, the procedure \nbegins  by building an array of setup -and-hold values as t he sample  \ndelay is swept through a range of values. Based on this infor -\nmation, a value of SMP is programmed to establish an optimal samp ling point. This ne w sampling point is then double -check ed  \nto verify that it is optimally set.  \nAD9780/AD9781/AD9783  Data Sheet \n \nRev. C | Page 26 of 32 Building the Array  \nThe following procedure is used to build the array: \n1. Set the values of SMP , SET, and HLD to 0 . Read and record \nthe value of the SEEK bit.  \n2. With SMP and SET  set to 0, increment the HLD  value until \nthe SEEK bit toggles , and then record the HLD  value. This \nmeas ures the hold time as shown in Figure 57. \n3. With SMP and HLD  set to 0, increment the SET value  until \nthe SEEK bit toggles , and then record the SET  value. This \nmeasures the setup time as shown in Figure 57. \n4. Set the value of SET and HLD to 0. Increment the value of \nSMP and record the value of the SEEK bit.  \n5. Increment HLD  until the SEEK bit toggles , and then record \nthe HLD  value.  Set HLD to 0 and increment SET  until the \nSEEK bit toggles , and then record the SET  value.  \n6. Repeat Step 4 and  Step 5 until the procedure has been \ncompleted for SMP values from 0 to 31.  \nNote that while building the table, a value for either SET or \nHLD may not be found to make the SEEK bit toggle. In this \ncase, assume a value of 15.  \nTable 14.

It  must  be noted that the \ndelay from the DCO input to the DCI output of the data source \nhas a profound effect on when the SEEK bit toggles over the \nrange of SMP values. Therefore, the tables generated in any \nparticular system do not necessarily match the example timing \ndata arrays in  Table 14. \nAs may be seen in Table 14, at 5 00 MHz the device has only two \nworking SMP settings. There is no way to monitor timing \nmargin in real time, so the output must be inter rupted to check \nor correct timing errors. The device must  not be clocked above \n500 MHz in applications where 100% up time is a requirement.   \nDetermining the SMP Value  \nOnce the timing data array has been built, the value of SMP can \nbe determined using the following procedure :  \n1. Look for the SMP value that corresponds to the 0 -to-1 \ntransition of the SEEK bit in the table. In the 5 00 MHz case \nfrom Table 14, this occurs for a n SMP value of 6.  \n2. Look for the SMP value that corresponds to the 1 -to-0 \ntransition of the SEEK bit in the table. In the 5 00 MHz case \nfrom Table 14, this occurs for a n SMP value of 11.  \n3. The same two values found in S tep 1 and S tep 2 indicate \nthe valid sampling window. In the 500 MHz case, this \noccurs for a n SMP value of 11.  \n4. The optimal SMP value in the valid sampling window is  \nwhere the following two conditions are true:  SET < HLD \nand |HLD  − SET| is the smallest value.  \nIn the 5 00 MHz case , the optimal SMP v alue is 7. \nAfter programming the calc ulated value of  SMP (referred to as \nSMP OPTIMAL ), the configuration  must  be tested to verify that \nthere is sufficient timing margin. This can be accomplished by \nensuring that the SEEK bit reads back as a 1 for SMP values \nequal to SMP OPTIMAL  + 1 and SMP OPTIM AL − 1. Also, it can  be \nnoted that the sum of SET and HLD must  be a minimum of 8. If \nthe sum is lower than this, you must  check for excessive  jitter  on \nthe clock input line  and check that the fre quency of the clock \ninput  does  not exceed the data sheet maximu m of 500 MHz (or \n1000 Mbps).  \nAs mentioned previously, low jitter and skew between the input \ndata bits and DCI are critical for reliable operation at the maxi -\nmum input data rates. Figure 58 shows the eye diagram for the \ninput data  signals that were used to collect the data in Table 14.  \nData Sheet AD9780/AD9781/AD9783  \n \nRev.

Eye Diagram of Data Source Used in Building the 500 MHz Timing \nData Array of Table 14 \nOver temperature, the valid sampling window shift s. Therefore, \nwhen attempting operation of  the device over 500 MHz, the \ntiming must be optimized again whenever the device undergoes \na temperature change of more than 20oC. Another consideration  \nin the timing of the digital data port is the propagation delay \nvariation from the clock output (DCOP/DCON)  to the clock \ninput . If this varies significantly over time (more than 25% of \nSET or HLD) due to temperature changes or other effects, \nrepeat this timing calib ration pro cedure.  \nAt sa mple rates of ≤400 MSPS, the interface timing margin is \nsufficient to allow for a simplified procedure. In this case, the \nSEEK bit can be recorded as SMP is swept through the range from 0 to 31. The center of the first valid sampling window can then be cho sen as the optimal value of SMP . Using  the 400 MHz \ncase from Table 14 as an example, the first valid sampling \nwindow occurs for SMP values of 7 to 13. The center of this \nwindow is 10, so 10 can be used as the optimal SMP value.  \nBIST OPERATION  \nThe BIST feature in the AD9780/AD9781/AD9783 is a simple \ntype adder  and is a user synchronizable BIST feature. In \nRegister 0x1A,  write 0x20 then  0x00 to clear the BIST registers \nwhile writing  zeros to the data bits  for at least eight clock cyc les \nto propagate to the BIST signature module. Then enable BIST \nby writing 0x80 to  Register 0x1A. Next , begin  writing a known \nset of vectors to the  data inputs. Proceed by writing zeros into \nthe bits after t he vectors  while the BIST read is being performed . \nPerform a BIST read by writing 0xC0  to Register 0x1A to  \nreceive the unique sum of rising edge data in Register 0x1B  \nand Register 0x1C and a unique sum of falling edge data in \nRegister  0x1D and Register 0x1E. These register  contents must  \nalways give the same values for the same vectors  \neach time they  are sent.  \n DRIVING THE CLK INPU T \nThe CLK input requires a low jitter differential drive signal. It is \na PMOS input differential pair powered from the 1.8 V supply ; \ntherefore, it is important to maintain the  specified 400 mV \ninput common -mode voltage. Each input pin can safely swing \nfrom 200 mV p- p to 1 V p -p abo ut the 400 mV common -mode \nvoltage.

Initially, the 1.2 V band gap reference is \nused to set up a current in an external resistor connected to \nFS ADJ (Pin 54). A simplified block diagram of the reference \ncircuitry is shown in Figure 62. The recommended value for  \nthe external resistor i s 10 kΩ, which sets up an IREFERENCE  in the \nresistor of 120 μA, which in turn provides a DAC output full -\nscale cur rent of 20 mA. Because the gain error is a linear function  \nof this resistor, a high precision resistor improves gain matching to the internal matching specification of the devices.

IFS vs. DAC Gain Code  \nDAC TRANSFER FUNCTION  \nEach DAC output of t he AD9780/AD9781/AD9783 drives two \ncomp lementary current outputs, I OUTP and I OUTN. IOUTP provides \na near I FS when all bits are high. For example,  \nDAC  CODE = 2N − 1 \nwhere N = 12/14 /16 bits for AD9780/AD9781/AD9783 \n(respectively),  while I OUTN provides  no current.  \n The c urrent output appearing at I OUTP and I OUTN is a function of \nboth the input code , and I FS and can be expressed as  \nIOUTP = (DAC  DATA /2N) × I FS (1) \nIOUTN = ((2N − 1) − DAC DATA)/2N × IFS (2) \nwhere DAC DATA = 0 to 2N − 1 (decimal representation).  \nThe two curre nt outputs  typically drive a resistive load directly \nor via a transformer. If dc coupling is required, I OUTP and IOUTN \nmust  be connected to matching resistive loads  (RLOAD) that are tied \nto analog common  (AVSS) . The single -ended voltage output \nappearing at  the IOUTP and I OUTN pins is  \nVOUTP = IOUTP × RLOAD (3) \nVOUTN = IOUTN × RLOAD (4) \nNote that to achieve the maximum output compliance of 1 V at \nthe nominal 20 mA output current, RLOAD must be set to 50 Ω . \nAlso note that the full -scale value of V OUTP and V OUTN must  not \nexceed the specified output compliance range to maintain \nspecified distortion and linearity performance . \nThere are two distinct advantages to  operating the AD9780/ \nAD9781/AD9783 differentia lly. First, differential operation  \nhelps cancel common -mode error sources associated with I OUTP \nand I OUTN, such as noise, distortion, and dc offsets. Second, the \ndifferential code -dependent current and subsequent output \nvoltage  (VDIFF) is twice the value o f the s ingle -ended voltage \noutput ( VOUTP or V OUTN), providing 2 × signal power to the load.  \nVDIFF = (I OUTP – IOUTN) × R LOAD (5) \nANALOG MODES OF OPER ATION  \nThe AD9780/ AD9781/AD9783 use a proprietary quad -switch  \narchitectu re that lowers the distortion of the D AC by eliminatin g a \ncode -dependent glitch that occurs with conventional dual -switch  \narchitectures. This architecture eliminates the code -dependent \nglitches, but creates a constant glitch at a rate of 2 × f DAC. For \ncommunications systems and other applications requiring good \nfrequency domain performance from the DAC, this is seldom \nproblematic.  \nThe quad -switch architecture also supports two additional \nmodes of operation: mix mode and return- to-zero mode. The \nwaveforms of these two modes are shown in Figure 64. In mix \nmode, the output is inverted every other half clock cycle. This \neffectively chops the DAC output at the sample rate. This chop -\nping has the effect of frequency shifting the sinc  roll-off from dc \nto f DAC. Additionally, there is a second subtle effect on the output  \nspectrum. The shifted spectrum is also shaped by a second sinc function with a first null at 2 × f\nDAC. The reason for this shaping \nis that the data is not continuously varying at twice the clock \nrate, but is simply r epeated.  \nData Sheet AD9780/AD9781/AD9783  \n \nRev. C | Page 29 of 32 In return -to-zero mode, the output is set to midscale every \nother half clock cycle. The output is similar to the DAC output \nin normal mode except that the output pulses are half the width \nand half the area. Because the output pulses have half the width, \nthe sinc f unction is scaled in frequency by two and has a first \nnull at 2 × f DAC. Because the area of the pulses is half that of the \npulses in normal mode, the output power is half the normal \nmode output power.  \n06936-061D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D10 INPUT DAT A\nDAC CLK\nQUAD-SWITCH\nDAC OUTPUT\n(fS MIX MODE)\nQUAD-SWITCH\nDAC OUTPUT\n(RETURN- TO-\nZERO MODE)t\nt\n \nFigure 64.
