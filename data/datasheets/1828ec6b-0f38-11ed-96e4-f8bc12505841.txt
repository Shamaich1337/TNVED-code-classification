Devices in \nthis 3.3V family include a 4-megabit, a 2-megabit, a 1-megabit, and a 512-kilobit PROM that provide an easy-to-\nuse, cost-effective method for reprogramming and storing \nXilinx FPGA configur ation bitstreams.\nWhen the FPGA is in Master Serial mode, it generates a \nconfiguration clock that drives the PROM. A short access \ntime after CE\n and OE are enabled, data is available on the \nPROM DATA (D0) pin that is connected to the FPGA DIN \npin. New data is available a short access time after each \nrising clock edge. The FPGA generates the appropriate number of clock pulses to complete the configuration. When the FPGA is in Slave Serial mode, the PROM and the FPGA \nare clocked by an external clock. When the FPGA is in Master SelectMAP mode, the FPGA\ngenerates a configuration clock that drives the PROM. When\nthe FPGA is in Slave Parallel  or Slave SelectMAP mode, an\nexternal oscillator generates the configuration clock that\ndrives the PROM and the FPGA. After CE\n and OE are\nenabled, data is available on the PROM’s DATA (D0-D7)pins. New data is available a short access time after each\nrising clock edge. The data is clocked into the FPGA on the\nfollowing rising edge of the CCLK. A free-running oscillatorcan be used in the Slave Parallel or Slave SelecMAP modes.\nMultiple devices can be cascaded by using the CEO\n output \nto drive the CE  input of the following device. The clock \ninputs and the DATA outputs of all PROMs in this chain are interconnected. All devices are compatible and can be \ncascaded with other members of the family or with the \nXC17V00 one-time programmable serial PROM family. 25\nXC18V00 Series In-System-Programmable\nConfiguration PROMs\nDS026 (v6.1) February 5, 20190 Product SpecificationR\nX-Ref Target - Figure 1\nFigure 1: XC18V00 Series Block DiagramControl\nand\nJTAG\nInterfaceMemorySerial\nor\nParallel\nInterfaceD0 DATA\nSerial or Parallel Mode\nD[1:7]\nParallel Interface Data\nAddressCLK CE\nTCK\nTMS\nTDI\nTDOOE/RESET\nCEO\nData\nDS026_01_0402047\nCF\nSend Feedback\nXC18V00 Series In-System-Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS026 (v6.1) February 5, 2019 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 2R\nPinout and Pin Description\nTable 1  provides a list of the pin names and descriptions for the 44-pin VQFP and PLCC and the 20-pin SOIC and PLCC\npackages. \nTable  1: Pin Names and Descriptions \nPin \nNameBoundary- \nScan OrderFunction Pin Descrip tion 44-pin VQFP44-pin\nPLCC20-pin\nSOIC &\nPLCC\nD0 4 DATA OUT D0 is the DATA output pin to provide data for \nconfiguring an FPGA in serial mode.40 2 1\n3O U T P U T  \nENABLE\nD1 6 DATA OUT D0-D7 are the output pins to provide parallel \ndata for configuring a Xilinx FPGA in Slave \nParallel/SelectMAP mode.\nD1-D7 remain in high-Z state when the PROM \noperates in serial mode. \nD1-D7 can be left unconnected when the \nPROM is used in serial mode.29 35 16\n5O U T P U T  \nENABLE\nD2 2 DATA OUT 42 4 2\n1O U T P U T  \nENABLE\nD3 8 DATA OUT 27 33 15\n7O U T P U T  \nENABLE\nD4 24 DATA OUT 9 15 7(1)\n23 OUTPUT \nENABLE\nD5 10 DATA OUT 25 31 14\n9O U T P U T  \nENABLE\nD6 17 DATA OUT 14 20 9\n16 OUTPUT \nENABLE\nD7 14 DATA OUT 19 25 12\n13 OUTPUT \nENABLE\nCLK 0 DATA IN Each rising edge on the CLK input increments \nthe internal address counter if both CE  is Low \nand OE/RESET  is High.43 5 3\nOE/\nRESET20 DATA IN When Low, this input holds the address \ncounter reset and the DATA output is in a high-\nZ state.

In-system programming \noffers quick and efficient design iterations and eliminates unnecessary package handling or socketing of devices. The Xilinx development system pr ovides the programming data \nsequence using either X ilinx iMPACT software and a \ndownload cable, a third-party JTAG development system, a JTAG-compatible board tester, or a simple microprocessor interface that emulates the JTAG instruction sequence. The iMPACT software also outputs serial vector format (SVF) \nfiles for use with any tools that accept SVF format and with automatic test equipment.\nAll outputs are held in a high-Z state or held at clamp levels \nduring in-system programming.\nOE/RESET\nThe ISP programming algorithm requires issuance of a reset that causes OE to go Low.\nExternal Programming\nXilinx reprogrammable PROMs can also be programmed by \na third-party device programmer, providing the added flexibility of using pre-pr ogrammed devices with an in-system programmable option for future enhancements and \ndesign changes.\nReliability and Endurance\nXilinx in-system programma ble products provide a \nguaranteed endurance level of 20,000 in-system program/erase cycles and a minimum data retention of 20 years. Each device meets all functional, performance, and data retention specifications wi thin this endurance limit. See \nthe UG116 , Xilinx Device Reliability Report , for device \nquality, reliability, and process node information.\nDesign Security\nThe Xilinx in-system prog rammable PROM devices \nincorporate advanced data security features to fully protect the programming data against unauthorized reading via JTAG. Table 3  shows the security setting available.\nThe read security bit can be set by the user to prevent the \ninternal programming pattern from being read or copied via JTAG. When set, it allows device erase. Erasing the entire device is the only way to reset the read security bit. \nTable  3: Data Security Options\nReset Set\nRead Allowed\nProgram/Erase Allowed\nVerify AllowedRead Inhibited via JTAG\nProgram/Erase Allowed\nVerify Inhibited\nX-Ref Target - Figure 2\nFigure 2: In-System Programming Operation (a) Solder Device to PCB and (b) Program Using Download CableDS026_02_06/1103GNDVCCINT\n(a) (b)\nSend Feedback\nXC18V00 Series In-System-Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS026 (v6.1) February 5, 2019 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 7R\nIEEE 1149.1 Boundary-Scan (JTAG)\nThe XC18V00 family is fully compliant with the IEEE Std. \n1149.1 Boundary-Scan, also known as JTAG. A Test Access Port (TAP) and registers are provided to support all required Boundary-Scan instructions, as well as many of the optional instructions specified by IEEE Std. 1149.1. In addition, the JTAG interface is used to implement in-system programming (ISP) to facilitate configurat ion, erasure, and \nverification operations on the XC18V00 device.\nTable 4  lists the required and optional Boundary-Scan \ninstructions supported in the XC18V00. Refer to the IEEE Std. \n1149.1 specification for a complete description of Boundary-Scan architecture and the required and optional instructions. \nInstruction Register\nThe Instruction Register (IR) for the XC18V00 is eight bits wide and is connected between TDI and TDO during an instruction scan sequence. In preparation for an instruction scan sequence, the instruction register is parallel loaded with a fixed instruction capture pattern. This pattern is shifted out onto TDO (LSB first), while an instruction is shifted into the instruction register from TDI. The detailed composition of the instruction capture pattern is illustrated in Figure 3 .\nThe ISP Status field, IR(4), contains logic “1” if the device is \ncurrently in ISP mode; otherwise, it contains logic “0”. The Security field, IR(3), contains logic “1” if the device has been programmed with the security option turned on; otherwise, it contains logic “0”. X-Ref Target - Figure 3\nBoundary-Scan Register\nThe Boundary-Scan register is used to control and observe\nthe state of the device pins during the EXTEST,\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD, and CLAMP instructions. Each output\npin on the XC18V00 has two register stages that contribute\nto the Boundary-Scan register, while each input pin only has\none register stage.\nFor each output pin, the register stage nearest to TDI controls \nand observes the output state, and the second stage closest to \nTDO controls and observes the high-Z enable state of the pin.\nFor each input pin, the register stage controls and observes \nthe input state of the pin.\nIdentification Registers\nThe IDCODE is a fixed, vendor-assigned value that is used \nto electrically identify the manufacturer and type of the device being addressed. The IDCODE register is 32 bits \nwide. The IDCODE register can be shifted out for \nexamination by using the IDCODE instruction. The IDCODE is available to any other system component via JTAG.\nSee Table 5  for the XC18V00 IDCODE values.\nThe IDCODE register has the following binary format:\nvvvv:ffff:ffff:aaaa:aaaa:cccc:cccc:ccc1\nwhere\nv = the die version number\nf = the family code (50h for XC18V00 family)\na = the ISP PROM product ID (26h or 36h for the XC18V04)\nc = the company code (49h for Xilinx)\nNote: The LSB of the IDCODE register is always read as logic “1” \nas defined by I EEE Std. 1149.1.\nTable 5  lists the IDCODE register values for XC18V00 devices.Table  4: Boundary-Scan Instructions\nBoundary-Scan \nCommandBinary \nCode [7:0]Description\nRequired Instructions:\nBYPASS 11111111 Enables BYPASS\nSAMPLE/\nPRELOAD00000001 Enables Boundary-Scan \nSAMPLE/PRELOAD \noperation\nEXTEST 00000000 Enables Boundary-Scan \nEXTEST operation\nOptional Instructions:\nCLAMP 11111010 Enables Boundary-Scan \nCLAMP operation\nHIGHZ 11111100 All outputs in high-Z state \nsimultaneously\nIDCODE 11111110 Enables shifting out \n32-bit IDCODE\nUSERCODE 11111101 Enables shifting out \n32-bit USERCODE\nXC18V00 Specific Instructions:\nCONFIG 11101110 Initiates FPGA configuration \nby pulsing CF  pin Low onceIR[7:5] IR[4] IR[3] IR[2] IR[1:0]\nTDI  → 000ISP\nStatusSecurity 00 1(1) →  TDO\nNotes: \n1.

By using the USERCODE instruction, a user-programmable identification code can be shifted out for examination. This code is loaded in to the USERCODE register during programming of the XC18V00 \ndevice. If the device is blank or was not loaded during programming, the USERCODE register contains FFFFFFFFh .\nXC18V00 TAP Characteristics\nThe XC18V00 family performs both in-system programming and IEEE 1149.1 Boundary-Scan (JTAG) testing via a single \nfour-wire Test Access Port (TAP). This simplifies system designs and allows standard Automatic Test Equipment to perform both functions. The AC characteristics of the XC18V00 TAP are described as follows.\nTAP Timing\nFigure 4  shows the timing relationships of the TAP signals.

This connection \nassures that the PROM address counter is reset before the start of any (re)configuration, even when a reconfiguration is initiated by a V\nCCINT  glitch.\n•The PROM CE  input can be driven from the DONE pin. \nThe CE  input of the first (or only) PROM can be driven \nby the DONE output of all target FPGA devices, provided that DONE is not permanently grounded. CE\n \ncan also be permanently tied Low, but this keeps the DATA output active and causes an unnecessary supply current of 10 mA maximum.\n•Slave Parallel/SelectMap mode is  similar to slave serial \nmode. The DATA is clocked out of the PROM one byte per CCLK instead of one bit per CCLK cycle. See FPGA data sheets for special configuration requirements.\nInitiating FPGA Configuration\nThe XC18V00 devices incorporate a pin named CF  that is \ncontrollable through the JT AG CONFIG in struction. \nExecuting the CONFIG  instruction through JTAG pulses the \nCF Low once for 300–500 ns, which resets the FPGA and \ninitiates configuration.\nThe CF  pin must be connected to the PROGRAM  pin on the \nFPGA(s) to use this feature.\nThe iMPACT software can also issue a JTAG CONFIG \ncommand to initiate FPGA configuration through the “Load FPGA” setting.\nThe 20-pin packages do not have a dedicated CF\n pin. For \n20-pin packages, the CF  → D4 setting can be used to route \nthe CF  pin function to pin 7 only if the parallel output mode \nis not used.\nSelecting Configuration Modes\nThe XC18V00 accommodates serial and parallel methods \nof configuration. The configuration modes are selectable through a user control register in the XC18V00 device. This control register is accessible through JTAG, and is set using the “Parallel mode” setting on the Xilinx iMPACT software. \nSerial output is the default configuration mode.Master Serial Mode Summary\nThe I/O and logic functions of the FPGA’s configurable logic block (CLB) and their associated interconnections are established by a configuration program. The program is loaded either automatically upon power up, or on command, depending on the state of the three FPGA mode pins. In Master Serial mode, the FPGA automatically loads the configuration program from an external memory. Xilinx PROMs are designed to accommodate the Master Serial mode.\nUpon power-up or reconfiguration, an FPGA enters the \nMaster Serial mode whenever all three of the FPGA mode-select pins are Low (M0=0, M1=0, M2=0). Data is read from the PROM sequentially on a single data line. Synchronization is provided by the rising edge of the \ntemporary signal CCLK, which is generated by the FPGA during configuration.\nMaster Serial mode provides a simple configuration \ninterface. Only a serial data line, a clock line, and two control lines are required to configure an FPGA. Data from the PROM is read sequentially, accessed via the internal address and bit counters which are incremented on every valid rising edge of CCLK. If the user-programmable, dual-function DIN pin on the FPGA is used only for configuration, it must still be held at a defined level during normal \noperation. The Xilinx FPGA fa milies take care of this \nautomatically with an on-chip pull-up resistor. \nCascading Configuration PROMs\nFor multiple FPGAs configured as a serial daisy-chain, or a single FPGA requiring larger configuration memories in a serial or SelectMAP configuration mode, cascaded PROMs provide additional memory ( Figure 7  and Figure 8 ). Multiple \nXC18V00 devices can be cascaded by using the CEO\n \noutput to drive the CE  input of the downstream device. The \nclock inputs and the data outputs of all XC18V00 devices in the chain are interconnected. After the last data from the first PROM is read, the next clock signal to the PROM asserts its CEO\n output Low and drives its DATA line to a \nhigh-Z state. The second PROM recognizes the Low level on its CE\n input and enables its DATA output.\nAfter configuration is complete, address counters of all \ncascaded PROMs are rese t if the PROM OE/RESET  pin \ngoes Low or CE  goes High.\nSend Feedback\nXC18V00 Series In-System-Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS026 (v6.1) February 5, 2019 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 10R\nX-Ref Target - Figure 5\nFigure 5: Master Serial ModeXilinx FPGA\nMaster SerialDIN\nCCLK\nDONE\nINIT_B (INIT)\nPROG_B (PROGRAM)\nTDI\nTMSTCK\nGNDMODE PINS\n(1)\nDOUT\nTDOVCCO  VCCINT\nDOUT\nCCLK\nDONE\nINIT_B (INIT)\nPROG_B (PROGRAM)DIN\nCCLK\nDONE\nINIT_B (INIT)\nPROG_B (PROGRAM)4.7 k Ω\n4.7 k Ω (1)VCCO(2)\n...OPTIONAL\nDaisy-chainedSlave FPGAs with different\nconfigurations...OPTIONAL\nSlave FPGAs with identical\nconfigurations\nTDI\nTMS\nTCK\nTDO\nNotes:\n1  For MODE pin connections and DONE pin pullup value, refer to the appropriate FPGA data sheet or user guide.2  For compatible voltages, refer to the appropriate data sheet.XC18V00 \nPROMVCCINT\nVCCO(2)\nTDI\nTMSTCK\nGNDD0\nCLK\nCE\nCEO\nOE/RESET\nCF\nTDO\nds026_18_20051007\nSend Feedback\nXC18V00 Series In-System-Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS026 (v6.1) February 5, 2019 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 11R\nX-Ref Target - Figure 6\nFigure 6: Master/Slave SelectMAP Mode or Slave Parallel ModeXC18V00 \nPROMVCCINT\nVCCO(2)\nGNDD[0:7]\nCLK\nCE\nCEO\nOE/RE SET\nCF\nTDOXilinx FPGA\nSelectMAP or\nSlave-ParallelD[0:7]\nCCLK\nDONE\nINIT_B (INIT)\nPROG_B (PROGRAM)TDITMS\nTCKGNDMODE PIN S\n(1)\nRDWR_B\nCS_B\nTDO VCCO   VCCINT\nD[0:7]\nCCLK\nDONE\nINIT_B (INIT)\nPROG_B (PROGRAM)4.7 kΩ\n4.7 kΩ (1)VCCO(2)\n...OPTIONAL\nSlave FPGA s \nwith identic al\nconfig urations\nNote s:\n1  For MODE pin connection s and DONE pin p ullup value, refer to the appropri ate FPGA d ata sheet or user guide.\n2  For comp atible volt ages, refer to the appropri ate data sheet.\n3  Extern al oscillator re quired for Virtex/Virtex-E SelectMAP , for Virtex-II/Virtex-II Pro Slave SelectMAP , and for\n   Spartan-II/Spartan-IIE Slave-Parallel mode s.DS026_19_111207Extern al\nOscillator(3)\nTDI\nTMS\nTCK\nTDO8\nSend Feedback\nXC18V00 Series In-System-Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS026 (v6.1) February 5, 2019 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 12R\nX-Ref Target - Figure 7\nFigure 7: Configuring Multiple Devices in Master/Slave Serial ModeXC18V00 \nPROM\nFirst \nPROM(PROM 0)VCCINT\nVCCO(2)\nTDI\nTMSTCKD0\nCLK\nCE\nCEO\nOE/RESET\nCF\nTDOXilinx FPGA\nMaster SerialDIN\nCCLK\nDONE\nINIT_B (INIT)\nPROG_B (PROGRAM)\nTDI\nTMSTCKMODE PINS\n(1)\nDOUT\nTDO4.7 kΩ\n4.7 kΩ (1)VCCO(2)\nTDI\nTMS\nTCK\nTDO\nNotes:\n1  For MODE pin connections and DONE pin pullup value, refer to the appropriate FPGA data sheet or user guide.2  For compatible voltages, refer to the appropriate data sheet.Xilinx FPGA\nSlave SerialDIN\nCCLK\nDONE\nINIT_B (INIT)\nPROG_B (PROGRAM)\nTDI\nTMSTCKXC18V00 \nPROM\nCascaded \nPROM(PROM 1)VCCINT\nVCCO(2)\nTDI\nTMSTCKD0\nCLK\nCE\nCEO\nOE/RESET\nCF\nTDOVCCO   VCCINT\nMODE PINS(1)\nTDO\nds026_16_20051007GNDGND GND\nGNDVCCO   VCCINT\nSend Feedback\nXC18V00 Series In-System-Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS026 (v6.1) February 5, 2019 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 13R\nX-Ref Target - Figure 8\nFigure 8: Configuring Multiple Devices with Identical Patterns in Master/Slave Serial, \nMaster/Slave SelectMAP, or Master/Slave Parallel ModeXC18V00 \nPROM\nFirst \nPROM(PROM 0)VCCINT\nVCCO(2)\nTDI\nTMS\nTCKGNDD[0:7]( 3)\nCLK\nCE\nCEO\nOE/RE SET\nCF\nTDOXilinx FPGA\nMaster \nSerial/ SelectMAPXilinx FPGA\nSlave \nSerial/ SelectMAPD[0:7](3)\nCCLK\nDONE\nINIT_B (INIT)\nPROG_B (PROGRAM)\nTDI\nTMS\nTCK\nGNDMODE PIN S(1)\nTDO4.7 kΩ\n4.7 kΩ (1)VCCO(2)\nTDI\nTMS\nTCK\nTDO\nNotes:\n1  For MODE pin connection s and DONE pin p ullup value, refer to the appropri ate FPGA d ata sheet or user guide.\n2  For comp atible volt ages, refer to the appropri ate data sheet.\n3  Serial mode s do not re quire the D[1:7], RDWR_B, or C S_B pin s to be connected.\n4  Extern al oscillator re quired if CLK i s not supplied by an FPGA in M aster mode.

If the power supply cannot \nmeet this requirement, then the device might not perform power-on reset properly. During the power-up sequence, OE/RESET\n is held Low by the PROM. \nOnce the required supplies have reached their respective \nPOR (Power On Reset) thresholds, the OE/RESET release \nis delayed (TOER minimum) to allow more margin for the \npower supplies to stabilize befor e initiating configuration. \nThe OE/RESET  pin is connected to an external pull-up \nresistor and also to the target FPGA\'s INIT_B pin. For systems utilizing slow-rising po wer supplies, an additional \npower monitoring circuit can be used to delay the target configuration until the system power reaches minimum operating voltages by holding the OE/RESET\n pin Low.\nWhen OE/RESET  is released, the FPGA’s INIT_B pin is \npulled High, allowing the FPGA\'s configuration sequence to begin. If the power drops below the power-down threshold (V\nCCPD ), the PROM resets and OE/RESET  is again held \nLow until the after the POR threshold is reached. OE/RESET\n polarity is not programmable. These power-up \nrequirements are shown graphically in Figure 9 .\nFor a fully powered Platform Flash PROM, a reset occurs \nwhenever OE/RESET  is asserted (Low) or CE  is deasserted \n(High). The address counter is reset, CEO  is driven High, and \nthe remaining outputs are placed in a high-Z state. Standby Mode\nThe PROM enters a low-power standby mode whenever CE  \nis asserted High. The address is reset. The output remains in a high-Z state regardless of the state of the OE input. JTAG pins TMS, TDI and TDO can be in a high-Z state or High. See Table 7 .\nWhen using the FPGA DONE signal to drive the PROM CE\n \npin High to reduce standby power after configuration, an external pull-up resistor should be used. Typically a 330 Ω \npull-up resistor is used, but refer to the appropriate FPGA data sheet for the recommended DONE pin pull-up value. If the DONE circuit is connected to an LED to indicate FPGA configuration is complete, and also connected to the PROM CE\n pin to enable low-power standby mode, then an external \nbuffer should be used to drive the LED circuit to ensure valid transitions on the PROMs CE\n pin. If low-power standby \nmode is not required for the PROM, then the CE  pin should \nbe connected to ground.\n5V Tolerant I/Os\nThe I/Os on each re-programmable PROM are fully 5V tolerant even through the core power supply is 3.3V. This allows 5V CMOS signals to connect directly to the PROM inputs without damage. In addition, the 3.3V V\nCCINT  power supply can be \napplied before or after 5V signals are applied to the I/Os. In mixed 5V/3.3V/2.5V systems, the user pins, the core power supply (V\nCCINT ), and the output power supply (VCCO) can have \npower applied in any order. This makes the PROM devices immune to power supply sequencing issues.\n \nX-Ref Target - Figure 9\nFigure 9: VCCINT  Power-Up RequirementsTOERVCCINT\nVCCPOR\nVCCPD200 µs ramp50 ms ramp\nTOER TRSTTIME (ms)A slow-ramping V CCINT  supply may still \nbe below the minimum operating voltage when OE/RESET is released.
