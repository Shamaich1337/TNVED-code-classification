These diodes incorporate a fully            \npassivated PIN diode chip resulting in an extremely \nlow reverse bias leakage current. The                        \nsemiconductor technology utilized in the MELF and \nHIPAX families draws on MACOM ’s substantial   \nexperience in PIN diode design and wafer             \nfabrication. The result is a device which has a thick  \nI-region and long carrier lifetime while maintaining \nlow series resistance and capacitance values. The \nchips of the MELF and HIPAX PIN diodes are                \nenclosed in a rugged ceramic package and is full \nface bonded to metal pins on both the anode and \ncathode. The result is a low loss PIN diode with low \nthermal resistance due to symmetrical thermal \npaths. The parts are offered in either magnetic or \nnon-magnetic, HIPAX (axial leaded) or MELF (Metal \nElectrode Leadless Faced) surface mount packages \nfor MRI applications. The  MELF is a rectangular \nSMQ, package which is designed for high volume \ntape and reel assembly. This easy to use package \ndesign makes automatic pick and place, indexing \nand assembly, extremely easy. The parallel flat sur-\nfaces are suitable for most key jaw or vacuum pick -\nup techniques. All of the solderable surfaces are tin \nplated and compatible with industry standard reflow \nand vapor phase soldering processes. See Applica-\ntion Note M538  for a typical solder reflow profile.  \n  \n \nMany of MACOM’s HIPAX PIN diodes are also  \navailable as chips. Please consult the “Silicon PIN  \nChip Datasheet”  for availability and specifications.  Absolute Maximum Ratings  \nTA = +25°C (Unless Otherwise Noted)1 \n1.
