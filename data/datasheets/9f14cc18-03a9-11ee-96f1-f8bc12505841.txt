See the PCB Layout and Thermal Considerations sections for more details . Return the R\nFB1/RFB2 feedback \ndivider to this net.\nVOUT (Bank 2): Power Output Pins . Apply output filter \ncapacitors between these pins and GND pins. V\nIN (Bank 3): Input Power. The V IN pin supplies current to \nthe LTM8054’ s internal power switches and to one terminal \nof the optional input current sense resistor . This pin must \nbe locally bypassed with an external , low ESR capacitor ; \nsee Table 1 for recommended values.I\nOUT (Pin C1): Output Current Sense . Tie this pin to the \noutput current sense resistor. The output average current \nsense threshold is 58mV, so the LTM8054 will regulate the output current to 58mV/R\nSENSE , where R SENSE  is the \nvalue of the output current sense resistor in ohms . The \nload is powered through the sense resistor connected at this pin. Tie this pin to V\nOUT if no output current sense \nresistor is used. Keep this pin within ±0.5V of V OUT under \nall conditions.\nLL (Pin F1): Light Load Indicator . This open-drain pin \nindicates that the output current , as sensed through the \nresistor connected between V OUT and I OUT, is approximately \nequivalent to 6mV or less . Its state is meaningful only if a \ncurrent sense resistor is applied between V OUT and I OUT. \nThis is useful to change the switching behavior of the \nLTM8054 in light loads. LL is typically tied to MODE or left open, but not connected to other loads or signal sources.\nSV\nIN (Pins H7, H8): Controller Power Input . Apply a \nseparate voltage above 5V if the LTM8054 is required to \noperate when the main power input (VIN) is below 5V. \nBypass these pins with a high quality, low ESR capacitor. \nIf a separate supply is not used , connect these pins to V IN. \nCLKOUT (Pin G1): Clock Output. Use this pin as a clock \nsource when synchronizing other devices to the switching frequency of the LTM8054. When this function is not used, leave this pin open.\nMODE (Pin G2): Switching Mode Input . The LTM8054  oper-\nates in forced continuous mode when MODE is open , and \ncan operate in discontinuous switching mode when MODE \nis low. In discontinuous switching mode, the LTM8054 will block reverse inductor current . This pin is normally \nleft open or tied to LL . This pin may be tied to GND for the \npurpose of blocking reverse current if no output current sense resistor is used.\nRT (Pin H1): Timing Resistor . The RT pin is used to program \nthe switching frequency of the LTM8054 by connecting a \nresistor from this pin to ground. The range of oscillation is \n100kHz  to 800kHz . The Applications Information section of \nthe data sheet includes a table to determine the resistance \nvalue based on the desired switching frequency. Minimize capacitance at this pin . A resistor to ground must be ap -\nplied under all circumstances.\nSYNC (Pin H2): External Synchronization Input. The SYNC \npin has an internal pull-down resistor . See the Synchroni -\nzation section in Applications Information for details . Tie \nthis pin to GND when not used. FB (Pin J1): Output Voltage Feedback . The LTM8054 \nregulates the FB pin to 1.2V. Connect the FB pin to a resis -\ntive divider between the output and GND to set the output \nvoltage. The output voltage is determined by the equation\n  VOUT=1.2 \x7fRTOP\nRBOT+1\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\nwhere R TOP and R BOT are the top and bottom feedback \nresistors, respectively. See Table 1 for recommended FB \ndivider resistor values.\nCOMP (Pin J2): Compensation Pin. The LTM8054 is \nequipped with internal compensation that works well with \nmost applications. In some cases, the performance of the LTM8054 can be enhanced by modifying the control loop compensation by applying a capacitor or RC network to this pin.\nLTM80548\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054PIN FUNCTIONS\nSS (Pin K1): Soft-Start. Connect a capacitor from this pin \nto GND to increase the soft-start time . Soft-start reduces \nthe input power source’s surge current by gradually in-\ncreasing the controller’s current limit. Larger values of the soft-start capacitor result in longer soft-start times . If no \nsoft-start is required, leave this pin open.\nCTL (Pin K2): Current Sense Adjustment . Apply a voltage \nbelow 1.2V to reduce the current limit threshold of I\nOUT.  \nDrive CTL to less than about 50mV to stop switching. \nThe CTL pin has an internal pull-up resistor to 2V. If not \nused, leave open.\nIOUTMON  (Pin L2): Output Current Monitor . This pin pro -\nduces a voltage that is proportional to the voltage between \nVOUT and I OUT. IOUTMON  will equal 1.2V when V OUT – IOUT \n= 58mV. This feature is generally useful only if a current \nsense resistor is applied between V OUT and I OUT.IINMON  (Pin L3): Input Current Monitor. This pin produces \na voltage that is proportional to the voltage between I IN \nand V IN. IINMON  will equal 1V when I IN\xa0–\xa0VIN = 50mV. This \nfeature is generally useful only if a current sense resistor is applied between V\nIN and I IN. This is a high impedance \noutput. Use a buffer to drive a load.\nRUN (Pin L4): LTM8054  Enable . Raise the RUN pin voltage \nabove 1.2V for normal operation . Above 1.2V (typical),  but \nbelow 6V, the RUN pin input bias current is less than 1µA. \nBelow 1.2V and above about 0.3V, the RUN pin sinks 3µA \nso the user can define the hysteresis with the external \nresistor selection . This will also reset the soft-start func -\ntion. If RUN is 0 .3V or less , the LT M8054  is disabled and \nthe input quiescent current is below 1 µA.\nIIN (Pin L6): Input Current Sense. Tie this pin to the input \ncurrent sense resistor . The input average current sense \nthreshold is 50mV, so the LTM8054 will regulate the input \ncurrent to 50mV/R SENSE , where R SENSE  is the value of the \ninput current sense resistor in ohms . Tie to V IN when not \nused. Keep this pin within ±0.5V of V IN under all conditions .\nLTM80549\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054BLOCK DIAGRAM\n0.2µF4.7µH\n0.47µF\n50V\n0.1µF\nCTL\nCOMP RT SYNC100k2V\n100k\nIOUTMON\n8054 BDIINMONCLKOUTFBIOUTVOUT\nSSGNDRUNIINVIN\nSVIN\nBUCK-BOOST CONTROLLER\nLL MODE\nLTM805410\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054OPERATION\nThe LTM8054 is a standalone nonisolated buck-boost \nswitching DC/DC power supply . The buck-boost topol -\nogy allows the LTM8054 to regulate its output voltage \nfor input voltages both above and below the magnitude of the output, and the maximum output current depends upon the input voltage. Higher input voltages yield higher maximum output current. \nThis converter provides a precisely regulated output volt-\nage programmable via an external resistor divider from 1.2V to 36V. The input voltage range is 5V to 36V, but the LTM8054 may be operated at lower input voltages if SV\nIN \nis powered by a voltage source above 5V. A simplified \nblock diagram is given on the previous page.\nThe LTM8054 contains a current mode controller , power \nswitching elements, power inductor and a modest amount \nof input and output capacitance. The LTM8054 is a fixed frequency PWM regulator. The switching frequency is set by connecting the appropriate resistor value from the RT pin to GND.\nThe output voltage of the LTM8054 is set by connecting \nthe FB pin to a resistor divider between V\nOUT and GND.\nIn addition to regulating its output voltage , the LTM8054 \nis equipped with average current control loops for both the \ninput and output. Add a current sense resistor between I IN \nand V IN to limit the input current below some maximum \nvalue. The I INMON  pin reflects the current flowing though \nthe sense resistor between I IN and V IN.\nA current sense resistor between V OUT and I OUT allows \nthe LTM8054 to accurately regulate its output current to \na maximum value set by the value of the sense resistor. \nIn general, the LTM8054 should be used with an output \nsense resistor to limit the maximum output current , as \nbuck-boost regulators are capable of delivering large cur-\nrents when the output voltage is lower than the input , if \ndemanded. Furthermore , while the LTM8054 does not require an \noutput sense resistor to operate , it uses information \nfrom the sense resistor to optimize its performance . If an \noutput sense resistor is not used, the efficiency or output ripple may degrade, especially if the current through the integrated inductor is discontinuous. In some cases, an output sense resistor is required to adequately protect the LTM8054 against output overload or short-circuit.\nA voltage less than 1.2V applied to the CTL pin reduces \nthe maximum output current. The current flowing through \nthe sense resistor is reflected by the output voltage of the I\nOUTMON  pin. Drive CTL to less than about 50mV to stop \nswitching.\nDriving the SYNC pin will synchronize the LTM8054 to an \nexternal clock source . The CLKOUT pin sources a signal \nthat is the same frequency but approximately 180 ° out of \nphase with the internal oscillator.If more output current is required than a single LTM8054 \ncan provide, multiple devices may be operated in parallel. \nRefer to the Parallel Operation section of Applications Information for more details.\nAn internal regulator provides power to the control circuitry \nand the gate driver to the power MOSFETs . This internal \nregulator draws power from the SV\nIN pin. The RUN pin is \nused to place the LTM8054 in shutdown, disconnecting \nthe output and reducing the input current to less than 1µA.\nThe LTM8054 is equipped with a thermal shutdown that \ninhibits power switching at high junction temperatures . \nThe activation threshold of this function is above 125 °C \nto avoid interfering with normal operation, so prolonged or repetitive operation under a condition in which the thermal shutdown activates may damage or impair the reliability of the device.\nLTM805411\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFor most applications, the design process is straight for-\nward, summarized as follows: \n1.  Look at Table 1 and find the row that has the desired \ninput range and output voltage.\n2.  Apply the recommended C IN, COUT, RFB1/RFB2 and R T \nvalues.\n3.  Apply the output sense resistor to set the output current limit. The output current is limited to 58mV/R\nSENSE , \nwhere R SENSE  is the value of the output current sense \nresistor in ohms.\nWhile these component combinations have been tested for proper operation, it is incumbent upon the user to verify proper operation over the intended system ’s line, load and \nenvironmental conditions. Bear in mind that the maximum output current is limited by junction temperature, the rela-tionship between the input and output voltage magnitude and other factors . Please refer to the graphs in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics section for guidance. The maximum frequency (and attendant R\nT value) at \nwhich the LTM8054 should be allowed to switch is given in Table 1 in the f\nMAX column, while the recommended \nfrequency (and R T value) for optimal efficiency over the \ngiven input condition is given in the f OPTIMAL  column. \nThere are additional conditions that must be satisfied if the synchronization function is used. Please refer to the Synchronization section for details.\nNote that Table 1 calls out both ceramic and electrolytic \noutput capacitors. Both of the capacitors called out in the table must be applied to the output . The electrolytic \ncapacitors in Table 1 are described by voltage rating , \nvalue and ESR. The voltage rating of the capacitor may be increased if the application requires a higher voltage stress derating. The LTM8054 can tolerate variation in the ESR; other capacitors with different ESR may be used , \nbut the user must verify proper operation over line , load \nand environmental conditions.

Applying capacitor values below those \nindicated in Table 1 is not recommended , and may result \nin undesirable operation. Using larger values is generally acceptable, and can yield improved dynamic response , if \nit is necessary . Again, it is incumbent upon the user to \nverify proper operation over the intended system’s line, load and environmental conditions.\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However, not all ceramic capacitors are suitable . \nX5R and X7R types are stable over temperature and ap -\nplied voltage and give dependable service . Other types, \nincluding Y5V and Z5U have very large temperature and voltage coefficients of capacitance. In an application cir -\ncuit they may have only a small fraction of their nominal capacitance resulting in much higher output voltage ripple than expected.\nA final precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns \nthe maximum input voltage rating of the LTM8054. A \nceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable inductance forms a high Q (underdamped) tank circuit. \nIf the LTM8054 circuit is plugged into a live supply , the \ninput voltage can ring to twice its nominal value , possi-\nbly exceeding the device’s rating. This situation is easily avoided; see the Hot-Plugging Safely section.\nFrequency Selection\nThe LTM8054 uses a constant frequency PWM architec -\nture that can be programmed to switch from 100kHz to \n800kHz by tying a resistor from the RT pin to ground . Table \n3 provides a list of R\nT resistor values and their resultant \nfrequencies.Table 3. Switching Frequency vs R T Value\nFREQUENCY RT VALUE (kΩ)\n100 453\n200 147\n300 84.5\n400 59\n500 45.3\n600 36.5\n700 29.4\n800 20.5\nAn external resistor from RT to GND is required . Do \nnot leave this pin open , even when synchronizing to an \nexternal clock. When synchronizing the switching of the LTM8054 to an external signal source , the frequency range \nis 200kHz to 700kHz.\nOperating Frequency T rade-Offs\nIt is recommended that the user apply the optimal R\nT \nvalue given in Table 1 for the input and output operating \ncondition. System level or other considerations , however, \nmay necessitate another operating frequency . While the \nLTM8054 is flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of operating frequencies, a haphazardly chosen one may result in undesirable operation under certain operating or fault conditions. A frequency that is too high can reduce efficiency, generate excessive heat or even damage the LTM8054 if the output is overloaded or short circuited . \nA frequency that is too low can result in a final design that has too much output ripple , too large of an output \ncapacitor or is unstable.\nLTM805413\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nParallel Operation\nT wo or more LTM8054s may be combined to provide \nincreased output current by configuring them as a mas-ter and a slave, as shown in Figure 1. Each LTM8054 is equipped with an I\nOUTMON  and a CTL pin . The I OUTMON  \npin’s 0 to 1.2V signal reflects the current passing through \nthe output sense resistor , while a voltage less than 1.2V \napplied to the CTL pin will limit the current passing through the output sense resistor . By applying the voltage of the \nmaster’s I\nOUTMON  pin to the slave ’s CTL pin, the two units \nwill source the same current to the load , assuming each \nLTM8054 output current sense resistor is the same value .\nThe design of a master-slave configuration is straight -\nforward:\n1. Apply the FB resistor network to the master , choosing \nthe proper values for the desired output voltage. Sug-\ngested values for popular output voltages are provided in Table 1.\n2. Apply a FB resistor network to the individual slaves \nso that the resulting output is higher than the desired output voltage.\n3. Apply the appropriate output current sense resistors \nbetween V\nOUT and I OUT. If the same value is used for the \nmaster and slave units , they will share current equally .\n4. Connect the master I OUTMON  to the slaves’ CTL pin \nthrough a unity gain buffer . The unity gain buffer is \nrequired to isolate the output impedance of the LTM8054  \nfrom the integrated pull-up on the CTL pins.\n5. Tie the outputs together.\nNote that this configuration does not require the inputs to \nbe tied together, making it simple to power a single heavy load from multiple input sources. Ensure that each input power source has sufficient voltage and current sourcing capability to provide the necessary power . Please refer \nto the Maximum Output Current vs V\nIN and Input Current \nvs Output Current curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section for guidance.\nParalleled LTM8054 s should normally be allowed to switch \nin discontinuous mode to prevent current from flowing from the output of one unit into another ; that is, the \nMODE pin should be tied to LL . In some cases , operating \nthe master in forced continuous (MODE open) and the \nslaves in discontinuous mode (MODE = LL) is desirable. \nIf so, current from the output can flow into the master ’s \ninput. Please refer to Input Precaution in this section for \na discussion of this behavior.\nMinimum Input Voltage and RUN\nThe LTM8054 needs a minimum of 5V for proper opera -\ntion, but system parameters may dictate that the device \noperate only above some higher input voltage . For ex-\nample, a LTM8054 may be used to produce 12V OUT, but \nthe input power source may not be budgeted to provide enough current if the input supply voltage is below 8V.\nThe RUN pin has a typical falling voltage threshold of \n1.2V and a typical hysteresis of 25mV. In addition, the \npin sinks 3µA below the RUN threshold. Based upon the above information and the circuit shown in Figure 2 , the \nV\nIN rising (turn-on) threshold is:\n  VIN=3µA \x7fR1( ) +1.225VR1+R2\nR2\nand the V IN falling turn-off threshold is: \n  VIN=1.2R1+R2\nR2Figure 1.

Some examples of this are provided in the Typical Applications section.\nSoft-Start\nSoft-start reduces the input power sources ’ surge currents \nby gradually increasing the controller ’s current . As indicated \nin the Block Diagram, the LTM8054 has an internal soft-\nstart RC network. Depending upon the load and operating conditions, the internal network may be sufficient for the application. To increase the soft-start time , simply add a \ncapacitor from SS to GND.\nOutput Current Limit (I\nOUT)\nThe LTM8054 features an accurate average output current \nlimit set by an external sense resistor placed between V OUT \nand I OUT as shown in Figure 3. V OUT and I OUT internally \nconnect to a differential amplifier that limits the current \nwhen the voltage V OUT – IOUT reaches 58mV. The current \nlimit is:\n  IOUT(LIM) =58mV\nRSENSE\nwhere R SENSE  is the value of the sense resistor in ohms.\nMost applications should use an output sense resistor as shown in Figure 3, if practical. The internal buck-boost power stage is current limited, but is nonetheless capable of delivering large amounts of current in an overload condition, especially when the output voltage is much lower than the input and the power stage is operating as a buck converter.\nWhen the voltage across the output sense resistor falls \nto about 1 /10th of full scale , the LL pin pulls low . If there \nis no output sense resistor , and I\nOUT is tied to V OUT, LL \nwill be active low. Applying an output sense resistor and tying the LL and MODE pins together can improve perfor -\nmance—see Switching Mode in this section.\nIn high step-down voltage regulator applications , the \ninternal current limit can be quite high to allow proper \noperation. This can potentially damage the LTM8054 in overload or short-circuit conditions . Apply an output \ncurrent sense resistor to set an appropriate current limit to protect the LTM8054 against these fault conditions.\nOutput Current Limit Control (CTL)\nUse the CTL input to reduce the output current limit from \nthe value set by the external sense resistor applied between V\nOUT and I OUT. The typical control range is between 0V \nand 1.2V. The CTL pin does not directly affect the input \ncurrent limit. If this function is not used, leave CTL open. Drive CTL to less than about 50mV to stop switching. The \nCTL pin has an internal pull-up resistor to 2V.\nInput Current Limit (I\nIN)\nSome applications require that the LTM8054  draw no more \nthan some predetermined current from the power source . \nCurrent limited power sources and power sharing are two \nexamples . The LTM8054  features an accurate input current \nlimit set by an external sense resistor placed between I IN \nand V IN as shown in Figure 4.

The current limit is:\n  IIN(LIM) =50mV\nRSENSE\nwhere R SENSE  is the value of the sense resistor in ohms.\nIf input current limiting is not required , simply tie I IN to V IN.\nInput Current Monitor (I INMON )\nThe I INMON  pin produces a voltage equal to approximately \n20 times the voltage of I IN – VIN. Since the LTM8054 input \ncurrent limit engages when I IN\xa0–\xa0VIN = 50mV, I INMON  will \nbe 1V at maximum input current.\nOutput Current Monitor (I OUTMON )\nThe I OUTMON  pin produces a voltage proportional to the \nvoltage of V OUT\xa0–\xa0IOUT. When output current limit engages \nat maximum output current , VOUT\xa0 –\xa0IOUT = 58mV and \nIOUTMON  will be 1.2V.\nSynchronization\nThe LTM8054 switching frequency can be synchronized \nto an external clock using the SYNC pin. Driving SYNC \nwith a 50% duty cycle waveform is a good choice , oth-\nerwise maintain the duty cycle between about 10 % and \n90%. When synchronizing, a valid resistor value (that is, a value that results in a free-running frequency of 100kHz \nto 800kHz) must be connected from RT to GND. While \nan RT resistor is required for proper operation, the value of this resistor is independent of the frequency of the externally applied SYNC signal. Be aware, however, that the LTM8054 will switch at the frequency prescribed by \nthe RT value if the SYNC signal terminates , so choose an \nappropriate resistor value.CLKOUT\nThe CLKOUT signal reflects the internal switching clock of \nthe LTM8054. It is phase shifted by approximately 180 ° \nwith respect to the leading edge of the internal clock . \nIf CLKOUT is connected to the SYNC input of another LTM8054, the two devices will switch 180 ° out of phase.\nInput Precaution\nIn applications where the output voltage is deliberately \npulled up above the set regulation voltage or the FB pin is abruptly driven to a new voltage , the LTM8054  may attempt \nto regulate the voltage by removing energy from the load for a short period of time after the output is pulled up . \nSince the LTM8054 is a synchronous switching converter, it delivers this energy to the input . If there is nothing on the \nLTM8054 input to consume this energy , the input voltage \nmay rise. If the input voltage rises without intervention, it may rise above the absolute maximum rating , damaging \nthe part. Carefully examine the input voltage behavior to see if the application causes it to rise.\nIn many cases, the system load on the LTM8054 input \nbus will be sufficient to absorb the energy delivered by the \nµModule regulator. The power required by other devices will consume more than enough to make up for what the LTM8054 delivers. In cases where the LTM8054 is \nthe largest or only power converter , this may not be true \nand some means may need to be devised to prevent the LTM8054’s input from rising too high . Figure 5a shows a \npassive crowbar circuit that will dissipate energy during momentary input overvoltage conditions . The break-down \nvoltage of the Zener diode is chosen in conjunction with the resistor R to set the circuit ’s trip point . The trip point \nis typically set well above the maximum V\nIN voltage under \nnormal operating conditions . This circuit does not have \na precision threshold , and is subject to both part-to-part \nand temperature variations, so it is most suitable for ap -\nplications where the maximum input voltage is much less than the 40V\nIN absolute maximum. As stated earlier, this \ntype of circuit is best suited for momentary overvoltages .\nFigure 5a is a crowbar circuit , which attempts to prevent \nthe input voltage from rising above some level by dumping energy to GND through a power device. In some cases, APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 4. Set the LTM8054 Input Current Limit with \nan External Sense ResistorIINL TM8054 RSENSE\nVINPOWER\nSOURCE\n8054 F04\nLTM805416\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054it is possible to simply turn off the LTM8054 when the \ninput voltage exceeds some threshold . An example of this \ncircuit is shown in Figure 5b. When the power source on \nthe output drives V IN above a predetermined threshold , \nthe comparator pulls down on the RUN pin and stops \nswitching in the LTM8054. When this happens, the input capacitance needs to absorb the energy stored within the LTM8054’s internal inductor, resulting in an additional voltage rise. This voltage rise depends upon the input capacitor size and how much current is flowing from the LTM8054 output to input.\nSwitching Mode\nThe MODE pin allows the user to select either discontinuous \nmode or forced continuous mode switching operation. In forced continuous mode , the LTM8054  will not skip cycles , \neven when the internal inductor current falls to zero or even reverses direction. This has the advantage of operating at the same fixed frequency for all load conditions , which can \nbe useful when designing to EMI or output noise speci-fications. Forced continuous mode , however, uses more \ncurrent at light loads , and allows current to flow from the \nload back into the input if the output is raised above the regulation point. This reverse current can raise the input voltage and be hazardous if the input is allowed to rise uncontrollably. Please refer to Input Precautions in this section for a discussion of this behavior.\nForced continuous operation may provide improved \noutput regulation when the LTM8054 transitions from buck, buck-boost or boost operating modes, especially at lighter loads. In such a case , it can be desirable to oper -\nate in forced continuous mode except when the internal inductor current is about to reverse . If so, apply a current \nsense resistor between V\nOUT and I OUT and tie the LL and \nMODE pins together . The LL pin is low when the current \nthrough the output sense resistor is about one-tenth the full-scale maximum. When the output current falls to this level, the LL pin will pull the MODE pin down, putting the LTM8054 in discontinuous mode , preventing reverse cur -\nrent from flowing from the output to the input. In the case where MODE and LL are tied together , a small capacitor \n(~0\n.1µF) from these pins to GND may improve the light \nload transient response by delaying the transition from the discontinuous to forced continuous switching modes . \nMODE may be tied to GND for the purpose of blocking reverse current if no output current sense resistor is used .\nFB Resistor Divider and Load Regulation\nThe LTM8054 regulates its FB pin to 1.2V, using a resistor \ndivider to sense the output voltage. The location at which \nthe output voltage is sensed affects the load regulation . \nIf there is a current sense resistor between V\nOUT and \nIOUT, and the output is sensed at V OUT, the voltage at the \nload will drop by the value of the current sense resistor multiplied by the output current . If the output voltage can \nbe sensed at I\nOUT, the load regulation may be improved.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nVIN\nZENER\nDIODE\nRQ\n8054 F05aL TM8054LOAD\nCURRENT\nGNDVOUT\nSOURCING\nLOAD\nVIN\nRUN\n8054 F05b10µFL TM8054LOAD\nCURRENT\nGNDVOUT\nSOURCING\nLOAD\nEXTERNAL\nREFERENCE\nVOL TAGE+–Figure 5a.

The LTM8054 is neverthe-less a switching power supply, and care must be taken to minimize EMI and ensure proper operation. Even with the high level of integration, you may fail to achieve specified operation with a haphazard or poor layout . See Figure 6 \nfor a suggested layout. Ensure that the grounding and heat sinking are acceptable.\nA few rules to keep in mind are:1\n. Place the R FB and R T resistors as close as possible to \ntheir respective pins.\n2. Place the C IN capacitor as close as possible to the V IN \nand GND connection of the LTM8054.\n3. Place the C OUT capacitor as close as possible to the \nVOUT and GND connection of the LTM8054.\n4. Minimize the trace resistance between the optional \noutput current sense resistor , ROUT, and V OUT. Minimize \nthe loop area of the I OUT trace and the trace from V OUT \nto R OUT.5. Minimize the trace resistance between the optional input current sense resistor, R\nIN and V IN. Minimize the loop \narea of the I IN trace and the trace from V IN to R IN.\n6. Place the C IN and C OUT capacitors such that their \nground current flow directly adjacent or underneath the LTM8054.\n7\n. Connect all of the GND connections to as large a copper pour or plane area as possible on the top layer . Avoid \nbreaking the ground connection between the external components and the LTM8054.\n8\n. Use vias to connect the GND copper area to the board ’s \ninternal ground planes. Liberally distribute these GND vias to provide both a good ground connection and thermal path to the internal planes of the printed circuit board. Pay attention to the location and density of the thermal vias in Figure 6 . The LTM8054 can benefit from \nthe heat sinking afforded by vias that connect to internal GND planes at these locations , due to their proximity \nto internal power handling components. The optimum number of thermal vias depends upon the printed circuit board design. For example, a board might use very small via holes . It should employ more thermal \nvias than a board that uses larger holes.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nROUT\nOUTPUT\nSENSE\nTO V OUTGND\nGND/THERMAL VIAS\nGNDRIN\nINPUTSENSE\n8055 F06COUT\nVOUT\nIOUTVINCIN\nSVIN\nLL RTMODE SYNCRUN\nFBIIN\nIOUT\nFigure 6 .

However, these capacitors \ncan cause problems if the LTM8054 is plugged into a live \nsupply (see Linear Technology Application Note \xa088 for a \ncomplete discussion). The low loss ceramic capacitor combined with stray inductance in series with the power source forms an underdamped tank circuit , and the volt -\nage at the V\nIN pin of the LTM8054 can ring to more than \ntwice the nominal input voltage , possibly exceeding the \nLTM8054 ’s rating and damaging the part . If the input supply \nis poorly controlled or the LTM8054 is hot-plugged into an energized supply, the input network should be designed to prevent this overshoot. This can be accomplished by installing a small resistor in series with V\nIN, but the most \npopular method of controlling input voltage overshoot is to add an electrolytic bulk capacitor to the V\nIN net. This \ncapacitor’s relatively high equivalent series resistance damps the circuit and eliminates the voltage overshoot . \nThe extra capacitor improves low frequency ripple filter -\ning and can slightly improve the efficiency of the circuit , \nthough it is likely to be the largest component in the circuit . \nThermal Considerations\nThe LTM8054 output current may need to be derated if \nit is required to operate in a high ambient temperature or \ndeliver a large amount of continuous power . The amount \nof current derating is dependent upon the input voltage , \noutput power and ambient temperature . The temperature \nrise curves given in the Typical Performance Character -\nistics section can be used as a guide . These curves were \ngenerated by a LTM8054 mounted to a 58cm\n2 4-layer FR4 \nprinted circuit board . Boards of other sizes and layer count \ncan exhibit different thermal behavior , so it is incumbent \nupon the user to verify proper operation over the intended system’ s line,  load and environmental operating conditions .\nThe thermal resistance numbers listed in the Pin Configura -\ntion of the data sheet are based on modeling the µModule \npackage mounted on a test board specified per JESD 51-9 \n(Test Boards for Area Array Surface Mount Package Thermal \nMeasurements\n). The thermal coefficients provided on this page are based on JESD 51-12 (Guidelines for Reporting \nand Using Electronic Package Thermal Information).\nFor increased accuracy and fidelity to the actual application , \nmany designers use FEA to predict thermal performance . \nTo that end, the Pin Configuration of the data sheet typi -\ncally gives four thermal coefficients: θ\nJA – Thermal resistance from junction to ambient. \nθJCbottom  – Thermal resistance from junction to the bottom \nof the product case.θ\nJCtop – Thermal resistance from junction to top of the \nproduct case.θ\nJB – Thermal resistance from junction to the printed \ncircuit board. While the meaning of each of these coefficients may seem \nto be intuitive, JEDEC has defined each to avoid confusion and inconsistency. These definitions are given in JESD 51-12, and are quoted or paraphrased below:\nθ\nJA is the natural convection junction-to-ambient air \nthermal resistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed \nenclosure. This environment is sometimes referred to as “still air ” although natural convection causes the air to \nmove. This value is determined with the part mounted to a JESD 51-9 defined test board , which does not reflect an \nactual application or viable operating condition.\nθ\nJCbottom  is the thermal resistance between the junction \nand bottom of the package with all of the component power \ndissipation flowing through the bottom of the package . In \nthe typical µModule converter, the bulk of the heat flows out the bottom of the package , but there is always heat \nflow out into the ambient environment . As a result , this \nthermal resistance value may be useful for comparing packages but the test conditions don ’t generally match \nthe user’s application.\nθ\nJCtop is determined with nearly all of the component power \ndissipation flowing through the top of the package . As the \nelectrical connections of the typical µModule converter are \non the bottom of the package , it is rare for an application \nto operate such that most of the heat flows from the junc -\ntion to the top of the part. As in the case of θ JCbottom , this APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTM805419\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nvalue may be useful for comparing packages but the test \nconditions don’t generally match the user’s application.\nθJB is the junction-to-board thermal resistance where \nalmost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the \nµModule converter and into the board , and is usually the \nsum of the θ JCbottom  and the thermal resistance of the \nbottom of the part through the solder joints and through a portion of the board. The board temperature is measured a specified distance from the package , using a 2-sided, \n2-layer board. This board is described in JESD 51-9.\nGiven these definitions , it should now be apparent that none \nof these thermal coefficients reflects an actual physical \noperating condition of a µModule converter. Thus, none \nof them can be individually used to accurately predict the thermal performance of the product . Likewise, it would \nbe inappropriate to attempt to use any one coefficient to correlate to the junction temperature versus load graphs given in the product ’s data sheet. The only appropriate way \nto use the coefficients is when running a detailed thermal analysis, such as FEA, which considers all of the thermal resistances simultaneously.A graphical representation of these thermal resistances is given in Figure 7.\nThe blue resistances are contained within the µModule \nconverter, and the green are outside.The die temperature of the LTM8054 must be lower than \nthe maximum rating of 125 °C, so care should be taken in \nthe layout of the circuit to ensure good heat sinking of the \nLTM8054. The bulk of the heat flow out of the LTM8054 \nis through the bottom of the µModule converter and the \nBGA pads into the printed circuit board . Consequently a \npoor printed circuit board design can cause excessive heating, resulting in impaired performance or reliability . \nPlease refer to the PCB Layout section for printed circuit board design suggestions.8054 F06\nµMODULEJUNCTION-TO-CASE (TOP)\nRESISTANCE\nJUNCTION-TO-BOARD RESISTANCEJUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT RESISTANCE (JESD 51-9 DEFINED BOARD)\nCASE (TOP)-TO-AMBIENT\nRESISTANCE\nBOARD-TO-AMBIENT\nRESISTANCEJUNCTION-TO-CASE\n(BOTTOM) RESISTANCEJUNCTION AMBIENT\nCASE (BOTTOM)-TO-BOARD\nRESISTANCE\nFigure 7\nLTM805420\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054TYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nVINSVIN\nIIN\nGND LL MODE\nFAN CONTROLL TM8054\nIOUT0.05/uni03A9 VOUT\nCLKOUT\nIINMON\nIOUTMON\nFBRUN\nCOMPSSSYNCCTLRT0.022/uni03A9\n11k100k\n8054 TA02a22µF\n25V68µF25VV\nOUT\n12V MAX\nFAN\n4.7µF50V×21µF50V\nV\nIN\n3V TO 36V\n36.5\n600kHz\nDAC+\nCTL VOL TAGE (V)0OUTPUT CURRENT (A)1.4\n0.21\n0.61.2\n0.80.4\n0\n0.9\n8054 TA02b1.2 0.6 0.312V OUT Fan Power from 3V IN to 36V IN with Analog \nCurrent Control and 2A Input Current Limiting\nMaximum Output Current vs CTL Voltage, 12V IN\nLTM805421\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054OUTPUT CURRENT (A)0OUTPUT VOL TAGE (V)25\n15\n520\n10\n0\n8054 TA03b1.5 1 0.512VIN\n24VIN\n36VIN24V OUT from 7.5V IN to 36V IN with 1.2A Accurate Current Limit \nVIN\nSVIN\nIIN\nGND LL MODEL TM8054\nIOUT0.05/uni03A9 VOUT\nCLKOUT\nIINMON\nIOUTMON\nFBRUN\nCTLSSSYNCCOMPRT\n5.23k\n8054 TA03a22µF\n25V33µF35VV\nOUT\n24V\n4.7µF50V×2V\nIN\n7.5V TO 36V\n31.6k\n650kHz100k\n+TYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nOutput Voltage vs Output Current\nLTM805422\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054OUTPUT CURRENT (A)0OUTPUT VOL TAGE (V)4\n2\n0.53\n12.53.5\n1.5\n0\n8054 TA04b3 2 112VIN\n24VIN\n36VINVIN\nSVIN\nIIN\nGND LL MODEL TM8054\nIOUT0.022/uni03A9 VOUT\nCLKOUT\nIINMON\nIOUTMON\nFBRUN\nCTLSSSYNCCOMPRT\n56.2k8054 TA04a47µF\n4V100µF6VV\nOUT\n3.3V\nOUTPUT\nCURRENTMONITOR4.7µF50V×2V\nIN\n6V TO 19V\n36.5k\n600kHz100k+3.3VOUT from 6V IN to 19V IN with 2.6A Accurate Current Limit \nand Output Current MonitorTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nOutput Voltage vs Output Current\nLTM805423\n8054fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8054TYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nT wo LTM8054s Paralleled to Get More Output Current.
