Pin Configuration  \n \nTable 6. Pin Function Descriptions  \nPin No.  Mnemonic  Description  \n1 LDAC  Load DAC. Logic input . This is used to update the DAC register and , consequently , the analog outputs. \nWhen tied permanently low, the addressed DAC register is updated on the falling edge of the 32nd \nclock. If LDAC  is held high during the write cycle, the addressed DAC input shift register is updated but \nthe output is held off until the falling edge of LDAC . In this mode, all analog outputs can be updated \nsimultaneously on the falling ed ge of LDAC . \n2 SYNC  Active Low Control Input. This is the frame synchronization signal for the input data. When SYNC  goes \nlow, it powers on the SCLK and DIN buffers and enables the shift  regis ter. Data is transferred in on the \nfalling edges of the next 32 clocks. If SYNC  is taken high before the 32nd falling edge, the rising edge of \nSYNC  acts as an interrupt , and the write sequence is ignored by the device.  \n3 VDD Power Supply Input. The  AD5066  can be operated from  2.7 V to 5.5 V. Decouple the supply with a 10 µ F \ncapacitor in parallel with a 0.1 µ F capacitor to GND . \n4 VREFB External Reference Voltage Input for DAC B.  \n5 VREFA External Reference Vol tage Input for DAC A.  \n6 VOUTA Unbuffered Analog Output Voltage  from DAC A.  \n7 VOUTC Unbuffered Analog Output Voltage  from DAC C.  \n8 POR  Power -On Reset Pin. Tying this pin to GND powers the DAC outputs to zero  scale  on power -up. Tying \nthis pin to VDD powers the DAC outputs to midscale.  \n9 VREFC External Reference Voltage Input for DAC C . \n10 CLR Asynchronous Clear Input. The CLR input is falling edge sensitive. When CLR is low, all LDAC  pulses are \nignored. When CLR is activated, the input register and the DAC register are updated with the data \ncontained in the CLR code register —zero, midscale, or full scale. Default setting clears the output to 0 V.  \n11 VREFD External Reference Voltage Input for DAC D.  \n12 VOUTD Unbuffered Analog Output Voltage  from DAC D.  \n13 VOUTB Unbuffered Analog Output Voltage  from DAC B.  \n14 GND  Ground Reference Point for All Circuitry on the Part.  \n15 DIN Serial Data Input. T his device has a 32 -bit shift register. Data is clocked into the register on the falling \nedge of the serial clock input.  \n16 SCLK  Serial Clock Input. Data is clocked into the input shift register on the falling edge of the serial clock input. \nData can be t ransferred at rates of up to 50 MHz. \n \n \nAD5066    \n \nRev.

A | Page 14 of 24 TERMINOLOGY  \nRelative Accuracy  or Integral Nonlinearity (INL)  \nRelative accuracy or INL is a measure of the maximum \ndeviation in LSBs from a straight line passing th rough the \nendpoints of the DAC transfer function. Figure 4, Figure 5,  \nand Figure 6 show  typical INL vs. code  plots . \nDifferential Nonlinearity  (DNL)  \nDNL is the difference between  the measured change and the \nideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes. A specified \ndifferential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB maximum ensures mono -\ntonicity. Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9 show  typical DNL vs. \ncode  plots . \nZero -Code Error \nZero -code error is a measure of the output error when zero \ncode (0x0000) is loaded into the DAC register. Ideally, the output should be 0 V . The zero -code error is always positive in \nthe AD5066, because the outp ut of the DAC cannot go below \n0 V. Zero -code error is expressed in millivolts. Figure 17 shows \na typical zero -code error vs. s upply  voltage plot. \nGain Error  \nGain error is a measure of the span error of the DAC . It is the \ndeviation in slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from the ideal, expressed as a percentage of the full -scale range.  \nGain Error Drift  \nGain error drift is a measure of the change in gain error with changes in temperature. It is expressed i n (ppm of full -scale \nrange)/°C.  \nZero -Code Error Drift  \nZero -code error drift is a measure of the change in zero -code \nerror with a change in temperature. It is expressed in  microvolts \nper degrees Celsius . \nFull -Scale Error  \nFull-scale error is a measure of the out put error when a full-\nscale code (0xFFFF) is loaded into the DAC register. Ideally, the output should be V\nREF − 1 LSB. Full -scale error is expressed as a \npercentage of the full -scale range.  \nDigital -to-Analog Glitch Impulse  \nDigital -to-analog glitch impulse  is the impulse injected into the \nanalog output when the input code in the DAC register changes state. It is normally specified as the area of the glitch in n anovolts \nper second  and is measured when the digital input code is \nchanged by 1  LSB at the major c arry tra nsition (0x7FFF to \n0x8000). See Figure 28. \nDC Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)  \nDC PSRR indicates how the output of the DAC  is affected by \nchanges in the supply voltage. DC PSRR is the ratio of the \nchange in V\nOUT to a ch ange in VDD for full -scale output of the \nDAC . It is measured in decibels.  DC Crosstalk  \nDC crosstalk is the dc change in the output level of one DAC in respo nse to a change in the output of another DAC. It is meas ured \nwith a full -scale output change on one  DAC (or soft power -down \nand power -up) while monitoring another DAC kept at midscale. \nIt is expressed in microvolts.  \nReference Feedthrough  \nReference feedthrough is the ratio of the amplitude of the signal at the DAC output to the reference input when the D AC output \nis not being updated (that is, \nLDAC\nDigital Feedthrough   is high). It is expressed in \ndecibels.  \nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into the analog output of a DAC from the digital input pins of the device bu t is measured when the DAC is not being written to \n(\nSYNC\nDigital Crosstalk    held high). It is specified in nanovolts per second  and \nmeasured with one sim ultaneous DIN  and SCLK  pulse  loaded \nto the DAC . \nDigital crosstalk is the glitch impul se transferred to the output \nof one DAC at midscale in response to a full -scale code change \n(all 0s to all 1s or vice versa) in the input register of another DAC. It is measured in standalone mode and is expressed in \nnanovolts per second . \nAnalog Crosstalk  \nAnalog crosstalk is the glitch impulse transferred to the output \nof one DAC due to a change in the output of another DAC. It is measured by loading one of the input registers with a full- scale \ncode change (all 0s to all 1s or vice versa) while keeping \nLDAC  \nhigh and then pulsing \nDAC -to-DAC Crosstalk  LDAC  low and monitoring the output of \nthe DAC whose digital code has not changed. The area  of the \nglitch is expressed in nanovolts per second .  \nDAC -to-DAC crosstalk is the glit ch impulse transferred to the \noutput of one DAC due to a digital code change and subsequent \noutput change of another DAC. This includes both digital and analog crosstalk. It is measured by loading one of the DACs \nwith a full -scale code change (all 0s to al l 1s or vice versa) with \nLDAC\nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)   low and monitoring the output of another DAC. The \nenergy of the glitch is expressed in nanovolts per second . \nTHD  is the difference between an ideal sine wave and its \nattenuated  version using the DAC. The sine wave is used as  \nthe reference for the DAC, and the THD is a measure of the \nharmonics present on the DAC output. It is measured in \ndecibels.  \n \n  AD5066\n \nRev. A | Page 15 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nDIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTER \nThe AD5066 is a quad 16-bit, serial input, voltage output \nnano DAC. The part operates from supply voltages of 2.7 V to \n5.5 V . Data is written to the AD5066 in a 32-bit word format via \na 3-wire serial interface. The AD5066 incorporates a power-on reset circuit to ensure the DAC output powers up to a known \noutput state. The devices also have a software power-down mode \nthat reduces the typical current consumption to typically 400 nA. \nBecause the input coding to the DAC is straight binary, the ideal \noutput voltage when using an external reference is given by \n\uf0f7\uf0f8\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf0b4 \uf03dN REFIN OUTDV V2 \nwhere: \nD is the decimal equivalent of the binary code that is loaded to \nthe DAC register (0 to 65,535). \nN is the DAC resolution. \nDAC ARCHITECTURE \nThe DAC architecture of the AD5066 consists of two matched DAC sections. A simplified circuit diagram is shown in \nFigure 39. The four MSBs of the 16-bit data word are decoded to drive 15 switches, E1 to E15. Each of these switches connects \none of 15 matched resistors to either GND or the V\nREF buffer \noutput.  The remaining 12 bits of the data word drive the S0 to \nS11 switches of a 12-bit voltage mode R-2R ladder network. \n2R\nS0\nVREF2R\nS12R\nS112R\nE12R\nE22R\nE152RVOUT\n12-BIT R-2R LADDER FOUR MSBs DECODED\nINTO 15 EQUAL\nSEGMENTS\n06845-005 \nFigure 39. DAC Ladder Structure \nREFERENCE BUFFER \nThe AD5066 operates with an external reference. Each of the \nfour on-board DACs has a dedicated voltage reference pin that \nis buffered. The reference input pin has an input range of 2 V  to V\nDD − 0.4 V . This input voltage is then used to provide a \nbuffered reference for the DAC core. SERIAL INTERFACE \nThe AD5066 has a 3-wire serial interface ( SYNC , SCLK, and \nDIN) that is compatible with SPI, QSPI, MICROWIRE, and most DSP interface standards. See Figure 2 for a timing diagram \nof a typical write sequence.  \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER \nThe input shift register is 32 bits wide (see Figure 40). The first \nfour bits are don’t cares. The next four bits are the command \nbits, C3 to C0 (see Table 7), followed by the 4-bit DAC address bits, A3 to A0 (see Table 8), and finally the bit data-word. The \ndata-word comprises of a 16-bit input code followed by four don’t \ncare bits (see Figure 40). These data bits are transferred to the Input register on the 32\nnd falling edge of SCLK. Commands can \nbe executed on individually selected DAC channels or on all DACs. \nTable 7.

Input Shift Register Content  \nAD5066    \n \nRev. A | Page 16 of 24 The write sequence begins by bringing the SYNC  line low. \nBringing the SYNC  line low enables the DIN and SCLK input \nbuffers. Data fr om the DIN line is clocked into the 32 -bit shift \nregister on the falling edge o f SCLK. The serial clock frequency \ncan be as high as 50 MHz, making the AD5066 compatible with \nhigh speed DSPs. On the 32nd falling clock edge, the last data bit \nis clocked in , and the programmed function is executed, that is, \na change in the input  registe r contents  (see Tabl e 8) and/or a \nchange in the mode of operation. At this stage, the SYNC  line \ncan be kept low or be brought high. In either case, it must be \nbrought high for a minimum of 2 μs  (single -chann el update , see \nthe t8 parameter in  Table  4) before the next  write sequence so \nthat a falling edge of SYNC  can initiate the next write sequence.  \nIdle SYNC  high between write sequences for even lower power \noperation of the part.  \nSYNC  Interrupt  \nIn a normal write sequence, the SYNC  line is kept low for at \nleast 32 falling edges of SCLK, and the DAC is updated on the \n32nd falling edge. However, if SYNC  is brought high before the \n32nd falling edge, this acts as an interrupt to the write sequence. \nThe input shift register is reset, and the write sequence is seen \nas invalid. Neither an update of the DAC register contents nor a \nchange in the operating mode occurs ( see Figure 42). \nPower -Down Modes  \nThe AD5066 can be configured  through software,  in one of  \nfour different modes : normal mode  (default)  and three separate  \npower -down modes (see Table  9). Any or all DACs can be \npowered down . Command 0100 is reserved for the power - \ndown function (see Table 7). These power -down modes are \nsoftware -programmable by setting two bi ts, Bit DB9 and \nBit DB8, in the inpu t shift register . Table  9 shows how the state  \nof the bits corresponds to the mode of operation of the device. Any or all DACs (DAC  A to DAC D) can be powered down to \nthe selected mode by setting the cor responding four bits (D B3, \nDB2, DB1, DB0) to 1. See Table 10 for the contents of the input \nshift register during power -down/power -up operation . When Bit DB9 and Bit DB8 in the control reg ister are set to 0, \nthe part is configured in normal mode with  its normal  power \nconsumption of  2.5 mA  at 5 V . However, for  the three power -\ndown modes, the supply current falls to 0.4 µA if all the chann els \nare powered down . Not only does the supply current fall, but \nthe output pin is also internally switched from the  output of the \nDAC t o a resistor network of known values. This has the advant age \nthat the output impedance of the part is known while the part  \nis in power -down mode. There are three different options : the \noutput is connected internally to GND through eith er a 1 k Ω or \na 100 k Ω resistor, or it is left open -circuited (three -state). The \noutput stage is illustrated in Figure  41. \nRESIS TOR\nNETWORKVOUTDAC\nPOWER-DOWN\nCIRCUIT RY\n06845-008 \nFigure 41.

By connecting  the POR  \npin low, the AD5066 output powers up to 0 V; by connecting  \nthe POR pin high, the AD5066 output powers up to midscale. \nThe output remains powered up at this level until a valid write \nsequence is made to the DAC. This is useful in appl ications where it is important to know the state of the output of the DAC \nwhile it is in the process of powering up. There is also a software \nexecutable reset function that resets the DAC to the power -on \nreset code. Command 0111 is reserved for this reset function \n(see Table 7). Any events on LDAC  or CLR  during power -on \nreset are ignored.  \nTable 10. 32- Bit Input Shift Register Contents for Power -Up/Power -Down Function  \nMSB              LSB \nDB31 to \nDB28  DB27  DB26  DB25  DB24  DB23 to DB20  DB10 to DB19  DB9  DB8  DB4 to DB7  DB3  DB2  DB1  DB0  \nX 0 1 0 0 X X PD1  PD0  X DAC D DAC C  DAC B  DAC A  \nDon’t \ncare s Command bits (C2 to C0)  Add ress bits \n(A3 to A0) —\ndon’t care s Don’t care s Power -down \nmode  Don’t \ncare s Power -down/power -up channel \nselection —set bit to 1 to select  \n \nAD5066    \n \nRev. A | Page 18 of 24 CLEAR CODE REGISTER  \nThe AD5066 has a hardware CLR  pin that is an asynchronous \nclear input. The CLR  input is falling edge sensitive. Bringi ng the \nCLR  line low clears the conte nts of the input register and the \nDAC registers to the data contained in the user -configurable \nCLR  register and sets  the analog outputs accordingly  (see \nTable  11). This function can be used in system calibration to \nload zero scale, midscale, or full scale to all channels together. \nThese clear code values are user -programmable by setting two \nbits, Bit DB1 and Bit DB0, in the control register (see Table  11). \nThe default setting clears the outputs to 0 V . Command 0101 is reserved for loading the clear code register (see Table 7). \nTable  11. Clear Code Register  \nDB1  (CR1 ) DB0  (CR0 ) Clears to C ode  \n0 0 0x0000  \n0 1 0x8000  \n1 0 0xFFFF  \n1 1 No operation  \nThe part exits clear code mode on the 32nd falling edge of the \nnext write to the part. If CLR  is activated during a write \nsequence, the write is aborted.  \nThe CLR  pulse activation time ( the falling edge of CLR  to when \nthe output starts to change ) is typically 10.6 µs. See Table 13 for \ncontents of the input shift register during the loading clear code register operation . \nLDAC  FUNCTION \nHardware  LDAC  Pin  \nThe outputs of all DACs can be updated simultaneously using \nthe hardware LDAC pin, as shown in Figure 2. There are two \nmethods of using the hardware LDAC pin : synchronously  \n(LDAC  permanently low) and asynchronously (LDAC  pulsed) .  Synchronous LDAC : LDAC  is held permanently low. After new \ndata is read, the DAC registers are updated on the fallin g edge \nof the 32nd SCLK pulse, provided LDAC  is held low.  \nAsynchronous LDAC : LDAC  is held high then pulsed low to \nupdate.  The outputs are not updated at the same time tha t the \ninput re gisters are writt en to. When LDAC  is pulsed low, the \nDAC registers are updated with the contents of the input \nregisters.  \nCommand 0001, 0010 and 0011  (see Table 7) update the DAC \nRegister/Registers , regardless of the level of the LDAC  pin \nSoftware  LDAC  Function  \nWriting to the DAC using Command 0110 loads the 4- bit \nLDAC  register (DB3 to DB0). The default for each channel is  \n0; that is, the LDAC  pin works normal ly. Setting the bits to 1 \nupdates the DAC channel regardless of the state of the hardware \nLDAC  pin, so that it ef fectively sees the hardware LDAC  pin  \nas being tied low (see Table 12 for the LDA C register mode of \noperation.) This flexibility is useful in applications where the \nuser wants to simultaneously update select channels while the remainder of the channels are synchronously updating.  \nTable 12.

If the AD5066 is in a \nsystem where other devices require an AGND -to-DGND con -\nnection, make the connection at one point only  and as close as \npossible to the AD5066.  \nBypass t he power supply to the AD5066 with 10  µF and 0.1 µF \ncapacitors. The capacitor s should be physically as close as \npossible to the device, with the 0.1 µF capacitor , ideally , right up \nagainst the device. The 10 µF capacitors are the tantalum bead type. It is important that the 0.1 µF capacitor has low effective series resis tance  and l ow effective series inductance, typical of \ncommon ceramic types of capacitors. This 0.1 µF capacitor provides a low impedance path to ground for high frequencies caused by transient currents due to internal logic switching.  \nThe power supply line should hav e as large a trace as possible to \nprovide a low impedance path and reduce glitch effects on the supply line. Shield the clocks and other fast switching digital \nsignals from other parts of the board by digital ground. Avoid crossover of digital and analog s ignals if possible. When traces \ncross on opposite sides of the board, ensure that they run at right angles to each other to reduce feedthrough effects through the board. The best board layout technique is the microstrip \ntechnique, where the component side of the board is dedicated \nto the ground plane only , and the signal traces are placed on  \nthe solder side. However, this is not always possible with a \n2-layer board.  \nMICROPROCESSOR INTER FACING  \nAD5066 to Black fin® ADSP -BF53X Interface  \nFigure 43 shows a serial interface between the AD5066 and  \nthe Blackfin  ADSP -BF53 x microprocessor. The ADSP -BF53 x \nprocessor family incorporates two dual -channel synchronous \nserial por ts, SPORT1 and SPORT0, for serial and multipro -\ncessor communications. Using SPORT0 to connect to the \nAD5066, the setup for the interface is as follows: DT0PRI  drives the DIN pin of the AD5066, TSCL K0 drives the SCLK  \nof the parts , and TFS0 drives  SYNC\n. \nAD5066* ADSP-BF53x*\nSYNC TFS0\nDIN DT0PRI\nSCLK TSCLK0\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.\n06845-009 \nFigure 43.

When data is being transmitted to \nthe DAC, the SYNC\n line is ta ken low (PC7). When the 68HC11/  \n68L11 is c onfigured as described previously, data appearing on \nthe MOSI output is valid on the falling edge of SCK. Serial data from the 68HC11/68L11 is transmitted in 8- bit bytes with only \neight falling clock edges occurring in the transmit cycle. Data is transmitt ed MSB first. To load data to the AD5066, PC7 is left \nlow after the first eight bits are transferred, and a second serial \nwrite operation is performed to the DAC. PC7 is taken high at \nthe end of this procedure.  \nAD5066    \n \nRev. A | Page 20 of 24 AD5066 to 80C51/80L51 Interface  \nFigure 45 shows a serial interface between the AD5066 and the \n80C51/80L51 microcontroller. The setup for the interface i s as \nfollows: TxD of the 80C51/ 80L51 drives SCLK of the AD5066, \nRxD drives DIN on  the AD5066, and a  bit-programmable pin o n \nthe port ( P3.3 ) drives  the SYNC  signal . When data is to be \ntransmitted  to the AD5066, P3.3 is taken low. The 80C51/80L51 \ntransmit data in 8 -bit bytes only; thus, only eight falling clock \nedges occur in the transmit cycle. To load d ata to the DAC, P3.3 \nis left low after the first eight bits are transmitted, and a second , \nthird , and fourth  write cycle is initiated to transmit the second , \nthird , and fourth  byte of data. P3.3 is taken high following the \ncompletion of this cycle. The 80C 51/80L51 output the serial \ndata in a format that has the LSB first. The AD5066 must \nreceive data with the MSB first. The 80C51/80L51 transmit \nroutine should take this into account.  AD5066*\nSYNC P3.3\nSCLK TxD\nDIN RxD\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.80C51/80L51*\n06845-011 \nFigure 45.
