[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a technical specialist with expertise in electronics. Your task is to analyze datasheets for electronic components and provide a concise summary of the product’s key characteristics and specifications. In addition, you need to gather textual information about the component, including its description and typical applications.Instructions:    Identify the correct component in the datasheet using the provided product code.    Summarize key parameters, including:        Voltage ratings        Current ratings        Power consumption        Operating temperature range        Package type        Special features or notes (if applicable)        Moisture Sensetive Level JEDEC J-STD-020E    Provide a short description of the component, including what it is (e.g., transistor, microcontroller, sensor) and its primary function.    Explain typical applications for the component (e.g., power management, signal processing, data storage, etc.).    Be thorough and accurate: Ensure the information corresponds specifically to the product code, as some datasheets cover multiple variants.Your goal is to create a clear and accurate technical summary that includes both key specifications and a description of what the component is used for.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Give me information about the component of 0430300003 production of MOLEX from the text:PRODUCT  SPECIFICATION \n \nREVISION:    TITLE: PRODUCT SPECIFICATION \nMicro-Fit (3.0) \nBMI Floating Connector System  SHEET No. \nL3 EC No: UCP2016-3198 \n1 of 12  \nDATE: 2016/02/17 \n   DOCUMENT NUMBER: CREATED / REVISED BY: CHECKED BY: APPROVED BY: \nPS -44300 -001  CSLAFTER S.SOUSEK F.SMITH \nTEMPLATE FILENAME: PRODUCT_SPEC[SIZE_A](V.1).DOC  \n  MICRO-FIT BMI FLOATING CONNECTOR SYSTEM \n \n1.0 SCOPE \nThis Product Specification covers the 3.00 mm (.118 inch) centerline (pitch) connector system \nterminated with 20 to 30 AWG wire using crimp technolo gy with tin plating. \n2.0 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION \n2.1 PRODUCT NAME AND SERIES NUMBERS \nMicro-Fit Dual Row BMI Floating Panel Receptacle:  441 33      Female Crimp Terminal: 43030 \nMicro-Fit Dual Row BMI Panel Mount Plug:  44300        Male Crimp Terminal: 43031 \nMicro-Fit Dual Row BMI Receptacle Headers: 44764 and 4 4769 \nMicro-Fit Dual Row BMI Headers:  44428 and 44432 \nMicro-Fit Dual Row BMI Vertical CPI Header : 45280 \nMicro-Fit Single Row BMI Floating Panel Receptacle: 46 623 \nMicro-Fit Single Row BMI Panel Mount Plug: 46625 \nMicro-Fit Single Row BMI Headers: 46622  \nTest Plug: 44242 (recommended for continuity testing o nly) \n2.2 DIMENSIONS, MATERIALS, PLATINGS AND MARKINGS \n(See the appropriate Sales Drawings for details) \nCrimp Terminals: Phosphor Bronze \nPanel Receptacle and Plug: Polyester, Nylon \nHeaders:  High Temp Nylon, LCP \nHeader Pins and Terminals:  Brass, Modified Tin/Brass, P hosphor Bronze \n2.3 SAFETY AGENCY APPROVALS \nUL File Number:?.
