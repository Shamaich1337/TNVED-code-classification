The output is band lim -\nited to frequencies above DC to below half the sampling frequency . \nSignal-to-Noise Ratio\nThe signal-to-noise (SNR) is the ratio between the RMS \namplitude of the fundamental input frequency and the RMS\n \namplitude of all other frequency components, except the first five harmonics. \nTotal Harmonic Distortion\nTotal harmonic distortion is the ratio of the RMS sum \nof all harmonics of the input signal to the fundamental \nitself. The out-of-band harmonics alias into the frequency band between DC and half the sampling frequency. THD is expressed as:\n THD = –20Log ( √(V22 + V 32 + V 42 + ... V N2)/V1)\nwhere V 1 is the RMS amplitude of the fundamental fre -\nquency and V2 through V N are the amplitudes of the second \nthrough nth harmonics. \nIntermodulation Distortion\nIf the ADC input signal consists of more than one spectral \ncomponent, the ADC transfer function nonlinearity can produce intermodulation distortion (IMD) in addition to THD.\n IMD is the change in one sinusoidal input caused \nby the presence of another sinusoidal input at a different frequency.If two pure sine waves of frequencies fa and fb are applied \nto the ADC input, nonlinearities in the ADC transfer function can create distortion products at the sum and difference frequencies of mfa ± nfb, where m and n = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n \nFor example, the 3rd order IMD terms include (2fa + fb), \n(fa + 2fb), (2fa – fb) and (fa – 2fb). The 3rd order IMD is defined as the ratio of the RMS value of either input tone to the RMS value of the largest 3rd order IMD product.\nSpurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)\nThe ratio of the RMS input signal amplitude to the RMS \nvalue of the peak spurious spectral component expressed in dBc. SFDR may also be calculated relative to full scale and expressed in dBFS.\nFull Power Bandwidth\nThe full power bandwidth is that input frequency at which \nthe amplitude of the reconstructed fundamental is reduced by 3dB for a full scale input signal. \nAperture Delay Time\nThe time from when a rising ENC\n+ equals the ENC– voltage \nto the instant that the input signal is held by the sample- \nand-hold circuit. \nAperture Delay Jitter\nThe variation in the aperture delay time from conversion \nto conversion. This random variation will result in noise when sampling an AC input. The signal to noise ratio due to the jitter alone will be: \n SNR JITTER = –20log (2 π • fIN • tJITTER )\nLTC2207-14/LT C2206-1417\n220714614fd For more information www.linear.com/LTC2207-14CONVERTER OPERATION\nThe LTC2207 -14/LTC2206-14 are CMOS pipelined \nmultistep converters with a front-end PGA. As \nshown in Figure 1, the converter has five pipelined ADC stages;  a sampled analog input will result in \na digitized value seven clock cycles later (see the  \nTiming Diagram section). The analog input is differential for improved common mode noise immunity and to maximize the input range. Additionally , the differential input drive \nwill reduce even order harmonics of the sample and hold cir\ncuit. The encode input is also differential for improved \ncommon mode noise immunity. \nThe LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 have two phases of op -\neration, determined by the state of the differential ENC+/\nENC– input pins. For brevity, the text will refer to ENC+ \ngreater than ENC– as ENC high and ENC+ less than ENC– \nas ENC low.Each pipelined stage shown in Figure 1 contains an ADC, \na reconstruction DAC and an interstage amplifier . In operation, the ADC quantizes the input to the stage and the quantized value is subtracted from the input by the DAC to produce a residue. The residue is amplified and output by the residue amplifier . Successive stages oper -ate out-of-phase so that when odd stages are outputting \ntheir residue, the even stages are acquiring that residue and vice versa.\nWhen ENC is low , the analog input is sampled differen -\ntially directly onto the input sample-and-hold capacitors, \ninside the “\ninput S/H” shown in the Block Diagram. At the \ninstant that ENC transitions from low to high, the voltage on the sample capacitors is held. While ENC is high, the held input voltage is buffered by the S/H amplifier which drives the first pipelined ADC stage. The first stage acquires the output of the S/H amplifier during the high phase of ENC. When ENC goes back low, the first stage produces \nits residue which is acquired by the second stage. At the same time, the input S/H goes back to acquiring the analog input. When ENC goes high, the second stage produces its residue which is acquired by the third stage. An iden -\ntical process is repeated for the third and fourth stages, resulting in \na fourth stage residue that is sent to the fifth \nstage for final evaluation.\nEach ADC stage following the first has additional range to \naccommodate flash and amplifier offset errors. Results from all of the ADC stages are digitally delayed such that the results can be properly combined in the correction logic before being sent to the output buffer .applica Tions inForMaTion\nLTC2207-14/LT C2206-1418\n220714614fd For more information www.linear.com/LTC2207-14Figure 2.

The dif -\nferential analog inputs are sampled directly onto sampling \ncapacitors (C SAMPLE ) through NMOS transistors. The \ncapacitors shown attached to each input (C PARASITIC ) are \nthe summation of all other capacitance associated with each input. \nDuring the sample phase when ENC is low, the NMOS \ntransistors connect the analog inputs to the sampling capacitors and they charge to, and track the differential input voltage. When ENC transitions from low to high, the sampled input voltage is held on the sampling capacitors. During the hold phase when ENC is high, the sampling capacitors are disconnected from the input and the held voltage is passed to the ADC core for processing. As ENC transitions from high to low, the inputs are reconnected to the sampling capacitors to acquire a new sample. Since the sampling capacitors still hold the previous sample, a charging glitch proportional to the change in voltage between samples will be seen at this time. If the change between the last sample and the new sample is small, the charging glitch seen at the input will be small. If the input change is large, such as the change seen with input frequencies near Nyquist, then a larger charging glitch will be seen.\nCommon Mode Bias\nThe ADC sample-and-hold circuit requires differential \ndrive to achieve specified performance. Each input should swing ±0.5625V for the 2.25V range (PGA = 0) or ±0.375V for the 1.5V range (PGA = 1), around a common mode voltage of 1.25V. The V\nCM output pin (Pin 2) is designed \nto provide the common mode bias level. V CM can be tied \ndirectly to the center tap of a transformer to set the DC input level or as a reference level to an op amp differential driver circuit. The V\nCM pin must be bypassed to ground \nclose to the ADC with a 2.2µF capacitor or greater .Input Drive Impedance\nAs with all high performance, high speed ADCs the \ndynamic performance of the LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 can be influenced by the input drive circuitry, particularly the second and third harmonics. Source impedance and input reactance can influence SFDR. At the falling edge of ENC the sample-and-hold circuit will connect the 4.9pF sampling capacitor to the input pin and start the sampling period. The sampling period ends when ENC rises, hold -\ning the sampled input on the sampling capacitor . Ideally\n , \nthe input circuitry should be fast enough to fully charge  \nthe sampling capacitor during the sampling period  \n1/(2F ENCODE ); however , this is not always possible and the \nincomplete settling may degrade the SFDR. The sampling \nglitch has been designed to be as linear as possible to minimize the effects of incomplete settling.\nFor the best performance it is recommended to have a \nsource impedance of 100Ω or less for each input. The source impedance should be matched for the differential inputs. Poor matching will result in higher even order harmonics, especially the second.applica Tions  inForMaTion\nLTC2207-14/LT C2206-1419\n220714614fd For more information www.linear.com/LTC2207-14INPUT  DRIVE  CIRCUITS\nInput Filtering\nA first order RC lowpass filter at the input of the ADC can \nserve two functions\n: limit the noise from input circuitry and \nprovide isolation from ADC S/H switching. The LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 have a very broadband S/H circuit, DC to 700MHz; it can be used in a wide range of applications; therefore, it is not possible to provide a single recom -\nmended RC filter . \nFigures 3, 4a\n and 4b show three examples of input RC \nfiltering at three ranges of input frequencies. In general \nit is desirable to make the capacitors as large as can be tolerated–this will help suppress random noise as well as noise coupled from the digital circuitry. The LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 do not require any input filter to achieve data \nsheet specifications; however , no filtering will put more stringent noise requirements on the input drive circuitry.\nT ransformer Coupled Circuits\nFigure 3 shows the LTC2207 -14/LTC2206-14 being driven \nby an RF transformer with a center-tapped secondary. The \nsecondary center tap is DC biased with V\nCM, setting the \nADC input signal at its optimum DC level. Figure 3 shows a 1:1 turns ratio transformer .

Reference CircuitDirect Coupled Circuits\nFigure 5 demonstrates the use of a differential amplifier to \nconvert a single ended input signal into a differential input signal. The advantage of this method is that it provides low frequency input response; however , the limited gain bandwidth of any op amp or closed-loop amplifier will degrade the ADC SFDR at high input frequencies. Addi -\ntionally, wideband op amps or differential amplifiers tend to have high noise. As a result, the SNR will be degraded unless the noise bandwidth is limited prior to the ADC input.\nReference Operation\nFigure 6 shows the LTC220 \n7-14/LTC2206-14 refer -\nence circuitry consisting of a 2.5V bandgap reference, \na programmable gain amplifier and control cir cuit. The \nLTC2207-14/LTC2206\n-14 have three modes of reference \noperation: Internal Reference, 1.25V external reference or 2.5V external reference. To use the internal reference, tie the SENSE pin to V\nDD. To use an external reference, \nsimply apply either a 1.25V or 2.5V reference voltage to the SENSE input pin. Both 1.25V and 2.5V applied to SENSE will result in a full scale range of 2.25V\nP-P (PGA = 0). A \n1.25V output V CM is provided for a common mode bias \nfor input drive circuitry. An external bypass capacitor is required for the V\nCM output. This provides a high frequency \nlow impedance path to ground for internal and external circuitry. This is also the compensation capacitor for the \nreference; it will not be stable without this capacitor . The \nminimum value required for stability is 2.2µF.\nThe internal programmable gain amplifier provides the \ninternal reference voltage for the ADC. This amplifier has very stringent settling requirements and is not accessible for external use.\nThe SENSE pin can be driven ± 5% around the nominal 2.5V \nor 1.25V external reference inputs. This adjustment range \ncan be used to trim the ADC gain error or other system gain errors. When selecting the internal reference, the SENSE pin should be tied to V\nDD as close to the converter \nas possible. If the sense pin is driven externally it should be bypassed to ground as close to the device as possible with 1µF (or larger) ceramic capacitor .\nPGA Pin \nThe PGA pin selects between two gain settings for \nthe ADC front-end. PGA = 0 selects an input range of  \n2.25V\nP-P; PGA = 1 selects an input range of 1.5V P-P. The \n2.25V input range has the best SNR; however , the distor -\ntion will be higher for input frequencies above 100MHz. For applications with high input frequencies, the low input range will \nhave improved distortion; however , the SNR \nwill be worse by up to approximately 2dB.

For the ADC to operate properly the encode signal should have a 50% (±5%) duty cycle. Each half cycle must be at least 4.52ns for the LTC2207-14 internal circuitry to have enough settling time for proper operation. For the LTC2206-14, each half cycle must be at least 5.94ns. Achieving a precise 50% duty cycle is easy with differential sinusoidal drive using a transformer or using symmetric differential logic such as PECL or LVDS. When using a single-ended ENCODE signal asymmetric rise and fall times can result in duty cycles that are far from 50%.\nAn optional clock duty cycle stabilizer can be used if the \ninput clock does not have a 50% duty cycle. This circuit uses the rising edge of ENC pin to sample the analog input. The falling edge of ENC is ignored and an internal falling edge is generated by a phase-locked loop. The input clock duty cycle can vary from 30% to 70% and the clock duty cycle stabilizer will maintain a constant 50% internal duty cycle. If the clock is turned off for a long period of time, the duty cycle stabilizer circuit will require one hundred clock cycles for the PLL to lock onto the input clock. To use the clock duty cycle stabilizer , the MODE pin must be connected to 1/3V\nDD or 2/3V DD using external resistors.\nThe lower limit of the LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 sample rate is determined by droop of the sample and hold circuits. The pipelined architecture of this ADC relies on storing analog signals on small valued capacitors. Junction leakage will discharge the capacitors. The specified minimum operat -\ning frequency for the LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 is 1Msps.Driving the Encode Inputs\nThe noise \nperformance of the LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 \ncan depend on the encode signal quality as much as on \nthe analog input. The encode inputs are intended to be driven differentially, primarily for noise immunity from common mode noise sources. Each input is biased through a 6k resistor to a 1.6V bias. The bias resistors set the DC operating point for transformer coupled drive circuits and can set the logic threshold for single-ended drive circuits.\nAny noise present on the encode signal will result in ad -\nditional aperture jitter that will be RMS summed with the \ninherent ADC aperture jitter . \nIn applications where jitter is \ncritical (high input frequen -\ncies), take the following into consideration:\n1. Differential drive should be used. 2. Use \nas large an amplitude possible. If using trans -\nformer coupling, use a higher turns ratio to increase the  \namplitude. \n3. If the ADC is clocked with a fixed frequency sinusoidal \nsignal, filter the encode signal to reduce wideband noise.\n4. Balance the capacitance and series resistance at both  \nencode inputs such that any coupled noise will appear \nat both inputs as common mode noise.\nThe encode inputs have a common mode range of 1.4V to \n3V. Each input may be driven from ground to V DD for \nsingle-ended drive.applica Tions  inForMaTion\nLTC2207-14/LT C2206-1424\n220714614fd For more information www.linear.com/LTC2207-14L TC2207-14/L TC2206-14\n2207614 F11OVDDVDD VDD\n0.1µF\nTYPICAL\nDATAOUTPUT\nOGNDOV\nDD0.5V TO 3.6V\nPREDRIVER\nLOGICDATA\nFROM\nLATCH33/uni03A9\nFigure 11.

The format is selected with the MODE pin. This pin has a four level logic input, centered at 0, 1/3V\nDD, 2/3V DD and \nVDD. An external resistor divider can be used to set the \n1/3V DD and 2/3V DD logic levels. Table 1 shows the logic \nstates for the MODE pin. Table 1.

A logic high on the OF pin indicates an overflow or underflow. \nOutput Clock\nThe ADC has a delayed version of the encode input available \nas a digital output. Both a noninverted version, CLKOUT+ and an inverted version CLKOUT– are provided. The  \nCLKOUT+/CLKOUT–  can be used to synchronize the \nFigure 12.

This is necessary \nwhen using a sinusoidal encode. Data can be latched on the rising edge of CLKOUT+ or the falling edge of CLKOUT–. CLKOUT+ falls and CLKOUT– rises as the data outputs are updated. \nDigital Output Randomizer\nInterference from the ADC digital outputs is sometimes \nunavoidable. Interference from the digital outputs may be from capacitive or inductive coupling or coupling through the ground plane. Even a tiny coupling factor can result in \ndiscernible unwanted tones in the ADC output spectrum. By randomizing the digital output before it is transmitted off chip, these unwanted tones can be randomized, trading a slight increase in the noise floor for a large reduction in unwanted tone amplitude.\nThe digital output is “Randomized” by applying an exclu -\nsive-OR logic operation between the LSB and all other data \noutput bits. T o decode, the reverse operation is applied\n; \nthat is, an exclusive-OR operation is applied between the LSB and all other bits. The LSB, OF and CLKOUT outputs are not affected. The output Randomizer function is active when the RAND pin is high.Output Driver Power\nSeparate output power and ground pins allow the output \ndrivers to be isolated from the analog circuitry. The power supply for the digital output buffers, OV\nDD, should be tied \nto the same power supply as for the logic being driven. For example, if the converter is driving a DSP powered by a 1.8V supply, then OV\nDD should be tied to that same \n1.8V supply. In CMOS mode OV DD can be powered with \nany logic voltage up to the V DD of the ADC. OGND can be \npowered with any voltage from ground up to 1V and must be less than OV\nDD. The logic outputs will swing between \nOGND and OV DD.\nInternal Dither\nThe LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 are 14-bit ADCs with a very \nlinear transfer function; however , at low input levels even slight imperfections in the transfer function will result in unwanted tones. Small errors in the transfer function are usually a result of ADC element mismatches. An optional internal dither mode can be enabled to randomize the input location on the ADC transfer curve, resulting in improved SFDR for low signal levels.\nFigure 13.

The dither DAC is driven by a long sequence pseudo-random number generator; the random number fed to the dither DAC is also subtracted from the ADC result. If the dither DAC is precisely calibrated to the ADC, very little of the dither signal will be seen at the output. The dither signal that does leak through will appear as white noise. The dither DAC is calibrated to result in less than 0.5dB elevation in the noise floor of the ADC, as compared to the noise floor with dither off.\nGrounding and Bypassing\nThe LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 require a printed circuit \nboard with a clean unbroken ground plane; a multilayer board with an internal ground plane is recommended. The pinout of the LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 has been \noptimized for a flowthrough layout so that the interaction between inputs and digital outputs is minimized. Layout for the printed circuit board should ensure that digital and analog signal lines are separated as much as possible. In particular , care should be taken not to run any digital track alongside an analog signal track or underneath the ADC. \nHigh quality ceramic bypass capacitors should be used \nat the V\nDD, VCM, and OV DD pins. Bypass capacitors must \nbe located as close to the pins as possible. The traces connecting the pins and bypass capacitors must be kept short and should be made as wide as possible.\nThe LTC2207-14/LTC2206-14 differential inputs should run \nparallel and close to each other . The input traces should be as short as possible to minimize capacitance and to minimize noise pickup.\nHeat T ransfer\nMost of the heat generated by the LTC2207-14/LTC2206-\n14 is transferred from the die through the bottom-side exposed pad. For good electrical and thermal performance, the exposed pad must be soldered to a large grounded pad on the PC board. It is critical that the exposed pad and all ground pins are connected to a ground plane of sufficient area with as many vias as possible.applica Tions  inForMaTion\nLTC2207-14/LT
