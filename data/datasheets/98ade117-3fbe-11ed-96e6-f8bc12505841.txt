The sensors support correlateddouble sampling (CDS) readout, reducing noise andincreasing dynamic range.\nThe image sensors have on −chip programmable gain\namplifiers and 10−bit A/D converters. The integration time\nand gain parameters can be reconfigured without any visible\nimage artifact. Optionally the on −chip automatic exposure\ncontrol loop (AEC) controls these parameters dynamically.The image’s black level is either calibrated automatically orcan be adjusted by adding a user programmable offset.\nA high level of programmability using a four wire serial\nperipheral interface enables the user to read out specificregions of interest. Up to eight regions can be programmed,\nachieving even higher frame rates.\nThe image data interface of the P1 −SN/SE/FN devices\nconsists of four LVDS lanes, enabling frame rates up to 210\nframes per second in Zero ROT mode for thePYTHON 1300. Each channel runs at 720 Mbps. A separate\nsynchronization channel containing payload information is\nprovided to facilitate the image reconstruction at thereceiving end. The P2 −SN/SE devices provide a parallel\nCMOS output interface at reduced frame rate. The\nP3−SN/SE/FN devices are the same as the P1 −SN/SE/FN\nbut with only two of the four LVDS data channels enabled,facilitating frame rates of 90 frames per second in NormalROT for the PYTHON 1300.Figure 1.

The combined microlens array and pixel array\nhas two important properties:\n1. Angular dependency of photoresponse of a pixel\nThe photoresponse  of a  pixel with microlens in the center\nof the array to a fixed optical power with varied incidence\nangle is as plotted in Figure 5, where definitions of angles /C0102x\nand /C0102y are as described by Figure 6.\n2. Microlens shift across array and CRA\nThe microlens array is fabricated with a slightly smaller\npitch than the array of photodiodes. This difference in pitch\ncreates a varying degree of shift of a pixel’s microlens withregards to its photodiode. A shift in microlens position\nversus photodiode position will cause a tilted angle of peak\nphotoresponse, here denoted Chief Ray Angle (CRA).\nMicrolenses and photodiodes are aligned with 0 shift and\nCRA in the center of the array, while the shift and CRAincreases radially towards its edges, as illustrated byFigure 7.\nThe purpose of the shifted microlenses is to improve the\nuniformity of photoresponse when camera lenses with afinite exit pupil distance are used. The CRA varies nearlylinearly with distance from the center as illustrated in Figure\n8, with a corner CRA of approximately 2.7 degrees. This\nedge CRA is matching a lens with exit pupil distance of∼80 mm.\nFigure 5.

Principles of Microlens ShiftShift\nCenter pixel\n(aligned)Edge pixel\n(with shift)CRA\nThe center axes of the microlens and the photodiode coincide for the center pixels. For the edge pixels,\nthere is a shift between the axes of the microlens and the photodiode causing a Peak Response Incidence\nAngle (CRA) that deviates from the normal of the pixel array.\nFigure 8.

The\nPYTHON 300 and PYTHON 500 image arrays contain672 (H) x 512 (V) and 832 (H) x 632 (V) readable pixelsrespectively, inclusive of 16 pixel rows and 16 pixel\ncolumns at every side to allow for reprocessing or color\nreconstruction. The sensors use in −pixel CDS architecture,\nwhich makes it possible to achieve a low noise read out ofthe pixel array in global shutter mode with CDS.\nThe function of the row drivers is to access the image array\nline by line, or all lines together, to reset or read the pixeldata. The row drivers are controlled by the on −chip\nsequencer and can access the pixel array.\nThe pixel biasing block guarantees that the data on a pixel\nis transferred properly to the column multiplexer when therow drivers select a pixel line for readout.Phase Locked Loop\nThe PLL accepts a (low speed) clock and generates the\nrequired high speed clock. Optionally this PLL can bebypassed. Typical input clock frequency is 72 MHz.\nLVDS Clock Receiver\nThe LVDS clock receiver receives an LVDS clock signal\nand distributes the required clocks to the sensor.\nTypical input clock frequency is 360 MHz in 10 −bit mode\nand 288 MHz in 8 −bit mode. The clock input needs to be\nterminated with a 100 /C0087 resistor.\nColumn Multiplexer\nAll pixels of one image row are stored in the column\nsample−and−hold (S/H) stages. These stages store both the\nreset and integrated signal levels.\nThe data stored in the column S/H stages is read out\nthrough 8 parallel differential outputs operating at a\nfrequency of 36 MHz. At this stage, the reset signal and\nintegrated signal values are transferred into anFPN−corrected differential signal. A programmable gain of\n1x, 2x, or 4x can be applied to the signal. The column\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n12multiplexer also supports read −1−skip−1 and\nread−2−skip−2 mode. Enabling this mode increases the\nframe rate, with a decrease in resolution.\nBias Generator\nThe bias generator generates all required reference\nvoltages and bias currents used on chip. An external resistor\nof 47 k /C0087, connected between pin IBIAS_MASTER and\ngnd_33, is required for the bias generator to operate\nproperly.\nAnalog Front End\nThe AFE contains 8 channels, each containing a PGA and\na 10−bit ADC.\nFor each of the 8 channels, a pipelined 10 −bit ADC is used\nto convert the analog image data into a digital signal, whichis delivered to the data formatting block. A black calibrationloop is implemented to ensure that the black level is mappedto match the correct ADC input level.\nData Formatting\nThe data block receives data from two ADCs and\nmultiplexes this data to one data stream. A cyclicredundancy check (CRC) code is calculated on the passingdata.\nA frame synchronization data block transmits\nsynchronization codes such as frame start, line start, frameend, and line end indications.\nThe data block calculates a CRC once per line for every\nchannel. This CRC code can be used for error detection at the\nreceiving end.\nSerializer and LVDS Interface (P1 −SN/SE/FN,\nP3−SN/SE/FN only)\nThe serializer and LVDS interface block receives the\nformatted (10 −bit or 8−bit) data from the data formatting\nblock. This data is serialized and transmitted by the LVDS\n288 MHz output driver.\nIn 10−bit mode, the maximum output data rate is\n720 Mbps per channel. In 8 −bit mode, the maximum output\ndata rate is 576 Mbps per channel.In addition to the LVDS data outputs, two extra LVDS\noutputs are avai lable. One of these outputs carries the output\nclock, which is skew aligned to the output data channels. The\nsecond L VDS output contains frame format synchronization\ncodes to serve system −level image reconstruction.\nOutput MUX (P2 −SN/SE)\nThe output MUX multiplexes the four data channels to\none channel and transmits the data words using a 10 −bit\nparallel CMOS interface.\nFrame synchronization information is communicated by\nmeans of frame and line valid strobes.\nChannel Multiplexer\nThe  P1−SN/SE/FN LVDS channel multiplexer provides\na 4:2 and 4:1 feature, in addition to utilizing all 4 outputchannels.\nThe P3− SN/SE/FN LVDS channel multiplexer provides\na 2:1 feature, in addition to utilizing both the outputchannels.\nSequencer\nThe sequencer:\n•Controls the image core. Starts and stops integration\nand control pixel readout.\n•Operates the sensor in master or slave mode.\n•Applies the window settings. Organizes readouts so that\nonly the configured windows are read.\n•Controls the column multiplexer and analog core.Applies gain settings and subsampling modes at the\ncorrect time, without corrupting image data.\n•Starts up the sensor correctly when leaving standby\nmode.\nAutomatic Exposure Control\nThe AEC block implements a control system to modulate\nthe exposure of an image. Both integration time and gainsare controlled by this block to target a predefined\nillumination level.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n13OPERATING MODES\nGlobal Shutter Mode\nThe PYTHON 300, PYTHON 500, and PYTHON 1300\noperate in pipelined or triggered global shuttering modes. In\nthis mode, light integration, light integration takes place onall pixels in parallel, although subsequent readout issequential. Figure 11 shows the integration and readout\nsequence for the global shutter. All pixels are light sensitiveat the same period of time. The whole pixel core is reset\nsimultaneously and after the integration time all pixel values\nare sampled together on the storage node inside each pixel.\nThe pixel core is read out line by line after integration. Note\nthat the integration and readout can occur in parallel orsequentially. The integration starts at a certain period,relative to the frame start.\nFigure 11. Global Shutter Operation\nPipelined Global Shutter Mode\nIn pipelined global shutter mode, the integration and\nreadout are done in parallel. Images are continuously readand integration of frame N is ongoing during readout of theprevious frame N−1. The readout of every frame starts with\na Frame Overhead Time (FOT), during which the analog\nvalue on the pixel diode is transferred to the pixel memory\nelement. After the FOT, the sensor is read out line per lineand the readout of each line is preceded by the RowOverhead Time (ROT). Figure 12 shows the exposure andreadout time line in pipelined global shutter mode.Master Mode\nThe PYTHON 300, PYTHON 500, and PYTHON 1300\noperate in pipelined or triggered global shuttering modes. In\nthis mode, light, the integration time is set through theregister interface and the sensor integrates and reads out the\nimages autonomously. The sensor acquires images without\nany user interaction.\nFigure 12.

The integration continues\nuntil the user or system deasserts the external pin. Upon afalling edge of the trigger input, the image is sampled and the\nreadout begins. Figure 13 shows the relation between the\nexternal trigger signal and the exposure/readout timing.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n14Figure 13.

After theintegration time, indicated by a user controlled pin, theimage core is read out. After this sequence, the sensor goesto an idle mode until a new user action is detected.\nThe three main differences with the pipelined global\nshutter mode are:\n•Upon user action, one single image is read.\n•Normally, integration and readout are done\nsequentially. However, the user can control the sensor\nin such a way that two consecutive batches are\noverlapping, that is, having concurrent integration andreadout.\n•Integration and readout is under user control through an\nexternal pin.\nThis mode requires manual intervention for every frame.\nThe pixel array is kept in reset state until requested.The triggered global mode can also be controlled in a\nmaster or in a slave mode.\nMaster Mode\nIn this mode, a rising edge on the synchronization pin is\nused to trigger the start of integration and readout. Theintegration time is defined by a register setting. The sensorautonomously integrates during this predefined time, afterwhich the FOT starts and the image array is readoutsequentially. A falling edge on the synchronization pin does\nnot have any impact on the readout or integration and\nsubsequent frames are started again for each rising edge.Figure 14 shows the relation between the external triggersignal and the exposure/readout timing.\nIf a rising edge is applied on the external trigger before the\nexposure time and FOT of the previous frame is complete,it is ignored by the sensor.\nFigure 14.

An external synchronization pin\ncontrols the start of  integration. When it is de −asserted, theFOT starts. The analog value on the pixel diode is\ntransferred to the pixel memory element and the imagereadout can start. A request for a new frame is started when\nthe synchronization pin is asserted again.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n15Normal and Zero Row Overhead Time (ROT) Modes\nIn pipelined global shutter mode, the integration and\nreadout are done in parallel. Images are continuously readout and integration of frame N is ongoing during readout ofthe previous frame N −1. The readout of every frame starts\nwith a Frame Overhead Time (FOT), during which the\nanalog value of the pixel diode is transferred to the pixel\nmemory element. After the FOT, the sensor is read out lineby line and the readout of each line is preceded by a RowOverhead Time (ROT) as shown in Figure 15.\nIn Reduced/Zero ROT operation mode (refer to\nFigure 16), the row blanking and kernel readout occur inparallel. This mode is called reduced ROT as a part of theROT is done while the image row is readout. The actual ROTcan thus be longer, however the perceived ROT will be\nshorter (‘overhead’ spent per line is reduced). Theintegration time and gain parameters can be reconfigured\nwithout any visible image artifact in Normal ROT mode.\nColumn−level of fset corrections are required in Zero ROT\nmode. Refer to Column −Level Image Correction\napplication note in the  PYTHON Developer’s GuideAND9362/D available at the Image Sensor Portal\n.\nThis operation mode can be used for two reasons:\n•Reduced total line time.\n•Lower power due of reduced clock −rate.\nNOTE: Zero ROT is not supported on P3 −SN/SE/FN\ndevices.\nFigure 15.

No internal clock is\nrunning (PLL / LVDS clock receiver is disabled).\nAll register settings are unchanged.Only a subset of the SPI registers is active for read/write\nin order to be able to configure clock settings and leave thelow power standby state. The only SPI registers that shouldbe touched are the ones required for the ‘Enable ClockManagement’ action described in Enable Clock\nManagement − Part 1 on page 17\nStandby (1)\nIn standby state, the PLL/LVDS clock receiver is running,\nbut the derived logic clock signal is not enabled.\nStandby (2)\nIn standby state, the derived logic clock signal is running.\nAll SPI registers are active, meaning that all SPI registerscan be accessed for read or write operations. All other blocks\nare disabled.\nIdle\nIn the idle state, all internal blocks are enabled, except the\nsequencer block. The sensor is ready to start grabbingimages as soon as the sequencer block is enabled.Running\nIn running state, the sensor is enabled and grabbing\nimages. The sensor can be operated in global master/slavemodes.\nUser Actions: Power Up Functional Mode Sequences\nPower Up Sequence\nFigure 18 shows the power up sequence of the sensor. The\nfigure indicates that the first supply to ramp −up is the\nvdd_18 supply, followed by vdd_33 and vdd_pix\nrespectively. It is important to comply with the describedsequence. Any other supply ramping sequence may lead tohigh current peaks and, as consequence, a failure of thesensor power up.\nThe clock input should start running when all supplies are\nstabilized. When the clock frequency is stable, the reset_n\nsignal can be de −asserted. After a wait period of 10 /C0109s, the\npower up sequence is finished and the first SPI upload can\nbe initiated.\nNOTE: The ‘clock input’ can be the CMOS PLL clock\ninput (clk_pll), or the LVDS clock input(lvds_clock_inn/p) in case the PLL is bypassed.\nFigure 18. Power Up Sequencereset_n\nvdd_18\nvdd_33clock input\nvdd_pix\n> 10us > 10us > 10us > 10usSPI Upload\n> 10us\nEnable Clock Management\nThe ‘Enable Clock Management’ action configures the\nclock management blocks and activates the clock generation\nand distribution circuits in a pre −defined way. First, a set of\nclock settings must be uploaded through the SPI register.These settings are dependent on the desired operation mode\nof the sensor.\nThe SPI uploads that need to be executed to configure the\nsensor for P1 −SN/SE/FN, P3 −SN/SE/FN 10 −bit serialmode, with the PLL, and all available LVDS channels, as\nwell as all other supported modes (P1 −SN/SE/FN 8 −bit\nserial, P2 −SN/SE 10 −bit parallel, ...) are available to\ncustomers under NDA at the onsemi  Image Sensor Portal\n.\nIn the serial modes, if the PLL is not used, the L VDS clock\ninput must be running.\nIn the P2 −SN/SE 10 −bit parallel mode, the PLL is\nbypassed. The clk_pll clock is used as sensor clock.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n18Use of Phase Locked Loop\nIf PLL is used, the PLL is started after the upload of the\nSPI registers. The PLL requires (dependent on the settings)some time to generate a stable output clock. A lock detectcircuit detects if the clock is stable. When complete, this isflagged in a status register.\nNOTE: The lock detect status must not be checked for\nthe P2−SN/SE sensor.\nRequired Register Upload\nIn this phase, the ‘reserved’ register settings are uploaded\nthrough the SPI register. Different settings are not allowedand may cause the sensor to malfunction.\nSoft Power Up\nDuring the soft power up action, the internal blocks are\nenabled and prepared to start processing the image datastream. This action exists of a set of SPI uploads.\nEnable Sequencer\nDuring the ‘Enable Sequencer’ action, the frame grabbing\nsequencer is enabled. The sensor starts grabbing images in\nthe configured operation mode. Refer to Sensor States onpage 17.\nThe ‘Enable Sequencer’ action consists of enabling bit\n192[0].\nUser Actions: Functional Modes to Power Down\nSequences\nDisable Sequencer\nDuring the ‘Disable Sequencer’ action, the frame\ngrabbing sequencer is stopped. The sensor stops grabbingimages and returns to the idle mode.\nThe ‘Disable Sequencer’ action consists of disabling bit\n192[0].\nSoft Power Down\nDuring the soft power down action, the internal blocks are\ndisabled and the sensor is put in standby state to reduce the\ncurrent dissipation. This action exists of a set of SPI uploads.Disable Clock Management\nThe ‘Disable Clock Management’ action stops the\ninternal clocking to further decrease the power dissipation.\nPower Down Sequence\nFigure 19 illustrates the timing diagram of the preferred\npower down sequence. It is important that the sensor is inreset before the clock input stops running. Otherwise, theinternal PLL becomes unstable and the sensor gets into anunknown state. This can cause high peak currents.\nThe same applies for the ramp down of the power\nsupplies. The preferred order to ramp down the supplies is\nfirst vdd_pix, second vdd_33, and finally vdd_18. Any other\nsequence can cause high peak currents.\nNOTE: The ‘clock input’ can be the CMOS PLL clock\ninput (clk_pll), or the LVDS clock input(lvds_clock_inn/p) in case the PLL is bypassed.\nFigure 19.

Refer to page 37 for more\ninformation.\n•Windowing: Changes with respect to windowing can\noccur during standby, idle, and running states. Refer to\nMultiple Window Readout on page 26 for more\ninformation.\n•Subsampling: Changes of the subsampling mode can\noccur during standby, idle, and running states by\nmodifying register 192. Refer to Subsampling on\npage 27 for more information.\n•Shutter Mode: The shutter mode can only be changed\nduring standby or idle mode by modifying register 192.\nReconfiguring the shutter mode during running state isnot supported.Sensor Configuration\nThis device contains multiple configuration registers.\nSome of these registers can only be configured while thesensor is not acquiring images (while register 192[0] = 0),while others can be configured while the sensor is acquiring\nimages. For the latter category of registers, it is possible to\ndistinguish the register set that can cause corrupted images\n(limited number of images containing visible artifacts) from\nthe set of registers that are not causing corrupted images.\nThese three categories are described here.\nStatic Readout Parameters\nSome registers are only modified when the sensor is not\nacquiring images. Reconfiguration of these registers whileimages are acquired can cause corrupted frames or eveninterrupt the image acquisition. Therefore, it isrecommended to modify these static configurations whilethe sequencer is disabled (register 192[0] = 0). The registersshown in T able 15 should not be reconfigured during image\nacquisition. A specific configuration sequence applies for\nthese registers. Refer to the operation flow and startup\ndescription.\nTable 6.

A corrupted image is animage containing visible artifacts. A typical example of a\ncorrupted image is an image which is not uniformlyexposed.\nThe effect is transient in nature and the new configuration\nis applied after the transient effect.\nTable 7. DYNAMIC CONFIGURATION POTENTIALLY CAUSING IMAGE ARTIFACTS\nGroup Addresses Description\nBlack level configuration 128–129\n197[12:8]Reconfiguration of these registers may have an impact on the black −level \ncalibration algorithm. The effect is a transient number of images with incorrect black level com-pensation.\nSync codes 129[13]\n116–126Incorrect sync codes may be generated during the frame in which these registers are modified.\nDatablock test configurations 144, 146–150 Modification of these registers may generate incorrect test patterns during \na transient frame.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n20Dynamic Readout Parameters\nIt is possible to reconfigure the sensor while it is acquiring\nimages. Frame related parameters are internallyresynchronized to frame boundaries, such that the modified\nparameter does not affect a frame that has already started.However, there can be restrictions to some registers asshown in Table 8. Some reconfiguration may lead to one\nframe being blanked. This happens when the modificationrequires more than one frame to settle. The image is blanked\nout and training patterns are transmitted on the data and sync\nchannels.\nTable 8. DYNAMIC READOUT PARAMETERS\nGroup Addresses Description\nSubsampling/binning 192[7]\n192[8]Subsampling or binning is synchronized to a new frame start.\nROI configuration 195\n256–303A ROI switch is only detected when a new window is selected as the active window \n(reconfiguration of register 195). reconfiguration of the ROI dimension of the active window does notlead to a frame blank and can cause a corrupted image.\nExposure reconfiguration 199−203 Exposure reconfiguration does not cause artifact. However, a latency of one frame is observed unless\nreg_seq_exposure_sync_mode is set to ‘1’ in triggered global mode (master).\nGain reconfiguration 204 Gains are synchronized at the start of a new frame. Optionally, one frame latency can be incorporatedto align the gain updates to the exposure updates (refer to register 204[13] − gain_lat_comp).\nFreezing Active Configurations\nThough the readout parameters are synchronized to frame\nboundaries, an update of multiple registers can still lead toa transient effect in the subsequent images, as someconfigurations require multiple register uploads. Forexample, to reconfigure the exposure time in master global\nmode, both the fr_length and exposure registers need to be\nupdated. Internally, the sensor synchronizes theseconfigurations to frame boundaries, but it is still possiblethat the reconfiguration of multiple registers spans over two\nor even more frames. To avoid inconsistent combinations,freeze the active settings while altering the SPI registers by\ndisabling synchronization for the correspondingfunctionality before reconfiguration. When all registers are\nuploaded, re −enable the synchronization. The sensor’s\nsequencer then updates its active set of registers and usesthem for the coming frames. The freezing of the active set\nof registers can be programmed in the sync_configurationregisters, which can be found at the SPI address 206.\nFigure 20 shows a reconfiguration that does not use the\nsync_configuration option. As depicted, new SPIconfigurations are synchronized to frame boundaries.\nFigure 21 shows the usage of the sync_configuration\nsettings. Before uploading a set of registers, thecorresponding sync_configuration is de −asserted. After the\nupload is completed, the sync_configuration is assertedagain and the sensor resynchronizes its set of registers to the\ncoming frame boundaries. As seen in the figure, this ensures\nthat the uploads performed at the end of frame N+2 and the\nstart of frame N+3 become active in the same frame (frameN+4).\nFigure 20.

The windows are defined by\nregisters 256 to 303. Each window can be activated ordeactivated separately using register 195. It is possible toreconfigure the inactive windows while the sensor isacquiring images.\nSwitching between predefined windows is achieved by\nactivation of the respective windows. This way a minimum\nnumber of registers need to be uploaded when it is necessary\nto switch between two or more sets of windows. As an\nexample of this, scanning the scene at higher frame ratesusing multiple windows and switching to full frame capture\nwhen the object is tracked. Switching between the twomodes only requires an upload of one register.Black Calibration\nThe sensor automatically calibrates the black level for\neach frame. Therefore, the device generates a configurablenumber of electrical black lines at the start of each frame.The desired black level in the resulting output interface canbe configured and is not necessarily targeted to ‘0’.\nConfiguring the target to a higher level yields some\ninformation on the left side of the black level distribution,while the other end of the distribution tail is clipped to ‘0’when setting the black level target to ‘0’.\nThe black level is calibrated for the 8 columns contained\nin one kernel. This implies 8 black level of fsets are generated\nand applied to the corresponding columns. Configurableparameters for the black −level algorithm are listed in\nTable 19.\nTable 10. CONFIGURABLE PARAMETERS FOR BLACK LEVEL ALGORITHM\nAddress Register Name Description\nBlack Line Generation\n197[7:0] black_lines This register configures the number of black lines that are generated at the start of a frame. At least one\nblack line must be generated. The maximum number is 255.\nNote:  When the automatic black −level calibration algorithm is enabled, make sure that this register is\nconfigured properly to produce sufficient black pixels for the black −level filtering.\nThe number of black pixels generated per line is dependent on the operation mode and window configu-\nrations:\nEach black line contains 162 kernels.\n197[12:8] gate_first_line A number of black lines are blanked out when a value different from 0 is configured. These blanked out\nlines are not used for black calibration. It is recommended to enable this functionality, because the firstline can have a different behavior caused by boundary effects. When enabling, the number of blacklines must be set to at least two in order to have valid black samples for the calibration algorithm.\nBlack Value Filtering\n129[0] auto_blackcal_enable Internal black −level calibration functionality is enabled when set to ‘1’. Required black level offset com-\npensation is calculated on the black samples and applied to all image pixels.\nWhen set to ‘0’, the automatic black −level calibration functionality is disabled. It is possible to apply an\noffset compensation to the image pixels, which is defined by the registers 129[10:1].\nNote:  Black sample pixels are not compensated; the raw data is sent out to provide \nexternal statistics and, optionally, calibrations.\n129[9:1] blackcal_offset Black calibration offset that is added or subtracted to each regular pixel value when auto_blackcal_en-\nable is set to ‘0’. The sign of  the offset is determined by register 129[10] (blackcal_offset_dec).\nNote:  All channels use the same offset compensation when automatic black calibration is disabled.\n129[10] blackcal_offset_dec Sign of blackcal_offset. If set to ‘0’, the black calibration offset is added to each pixel. If set to ‘1’, the\nblack calibration offset is subtracted from each pixel.\nThis register is not used when auto_blackcal_enable is set to ‘1’.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n22Table 10. CONFIGURABLE PARAMETERS FOR BLACK LEVEL ALGORITHM\nAddress Description Register Name\nBlack Line Generation\n128[10:8] black_samples The black samples are low −pass filtered before being used for black level calculation. The more sam-\nples are taken into account, the more accurate the calibration, but more samples require more blacklines, which in turn affects the frame rate.\nThe effective number of samples taken into account for filtering is 2^ black_samples.Note:  An error is reported by the device if more samples than available are requested (refer to register\n136).\nBlack Level Filtering Monitoring\n136 blackcal_error0 An error is reported by the device if there are requests for more samples than are available (each bit\ncorresponding to one data path). The black level is not compensated correctly if one of the channelsindicates an error. There are three possible methods to overcome this situation and to perform a correctoffset compensation:\n•Increase the number of black lines such that enough samples are generated at the cost of increas-\ning frame time (refer to register 197).\n•Relax the black calibration filtering at the cost of less accurate black level determination (refer to\nregister 128).\n•Disable automatic black level calibration and provide the offset via SPI register upload. Note that\nthe black level can drift in function of the temperature. It is thus recommended to perform the offsetcalibration periodically to avoid this drift.\nNOTE: Device will meet the specifications after thermal equilibrium has been established when mounted in a test socket or printe d circuit\nboard with maintained transverse airflow greater than 500 lfpm.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n23Serial Peripheral Interface\nThe sensor configuration registers are accessed through\nan SPI. The SPI consists of four wires:\n•sck: Serial Clock\n•ss_n: Active Low Slave Select\n•mosi: Master Out, Slave In, or Serial Data In\n•miso: Master In, Slave Out, or Serial Data Out\nThe SPI is synchronous to the clock provided by the\nmaster (sck) and asynchronous to the sensor’s system clock.\nWhen the master wants to write or read a sensor’s register,\nit selects the chip by pulling down the Slave Select line\n(ss_n). When selected, data is sent serially and synchronous\nto the SPI clock (sck).\nFigure 22 shows the communication protocol for read and\nwrite accesses of the SPI registers. The PYTHON 300,PYTHON 500, and PYTHON 1300 image sensors use 9 −bit\naddresses and 16 −bit data words.\nData driven by the system is colored blue in Figure 16,\nwhile data driven by the sensor is colored yellow. The data\nin grey indicates high −Z periods on the miso interface. Red\nmarkers indicate sampling points for the sensor (mosisampling); green markers indicate sampling points for thesystem (miso sampling during read operations).\nThe access sequence is:\n3. Select the sensor for read or write by pulling down\nthe ss_n line.\n4. One SPI clock cycle after selecting the sensor, the\n9−bit data is transferred, most significant bit first.The sck clock is passed through to the sensor as\nindicated in Figure 22. The sensor samples thisdata on a rising edge of the sck clock (mosi needs\nto be driven by the system on the falling edge of\nthe sck clock).\n5. The tenth bit sent by the master indicates the type\nof transfer: high for a write command, low for aread command.\n6. Data transmission:\n- For write commands, the master continues\nsending the 16 −bit data, most significant bit first.\n- For read commands, the sensor returns the\nrequested address on the miso pin, most significant\nbit first. The miso pin must be sampled by thesystem on the falling edge of sck (assuming\nnominal system clock frequency and maximum\n10 MHz SPI frequency).\n7. When data transmission is complete, the system\ndeselects the sensor one clock period after the last\nbit transmission by pulling ss_n high.\nNote that the maximum frequency for the SPI interface\nscales with the input clock frequency, bit depth and LVDSoutput multiplexing as described in Table 5.\nConsecutive SPI commands can be issued by leaving at\nleast two SPI clock periods between two register uploads.Deselect the chip between the SPI uploads by pulling the\nss_n pin high.\nFigure 22.

Dual and triple slope handling\nduring global shutter operation is similar to the single slope\noperation. Extra integration time registers are available.\nGlobal Shutter Mode\nPipelined Global Shutter (Master)\nThe integration time is controlled by the registers\nfr_length[15:0] and exposure[15:0]. The mult_timerconfiguration defines the granularity of the registers\nreset_length and exposure. It is read as number of system\nclock cycles (14.706 ns nominal at 68 MHz) for theP1−SN/SE/FN, P3 −SN/SE/FN version and 18 MHz cycles\n(55.556 ns nominal) for the P2 −SN/SE version.\nThe exposure control for (Pipelined) Global Master mode\nis depicted in Figure 23.\nThe pixel values are transferred to the storage node during\nFOT, after which all photo diodes are reset. The reset state\nremains active for a certain time, defined by the reset_length\nand mult_timer registers, as shown in the figure. Note thatmeanwhile the image array is read out line by line. After thisreset period, the global photodiode reset condition is\nabandoned. This indicates the start of the integration orexposure time. The length of the exposure time is defined by\nthe registers exposure and mult_timer.\nNOTE: The start of the exposure time is synchronized to\nthe start of a new line (during ROT) if theexposure period starts during a frame readout.As a consequence, the effective time duringwhich the image core is in a reset state is\nextended to the start of a new line.\n•Make sure that the sum of the reset time and exposure\ntime exceeds the time required to readout all lines. If\nthis is not the case, the exposure time is extended untilall (active) lines are read out.\n•Alternatively, it is possible to specify the frame time\nand exposure time. The sensor automatically calculates\nthe required reset time. This mode is enabled by the\nfr_mode register. The frame time is specified in theregister fr_length.\nFigure 23.

Theexposure or integration time is defined by the registersexposure and mult_timer, as in the master pipelined global\nmode. The fr_length configuration is not used. Thisoperation is graphically shown in Figure 24.\nFigure 24.

Note however the trigger must be asserted for\nat least 100 ns.\n•The start of the exposure time is synchronized to the\nstart of a new line (during ROT) if the exposure period\nstarts during a frame readout. As a consequence, the\neffective time during which the image core is in a resetstate is extended to the start of a new line.\n•If the exposure timer expires before the end of readout,\nthe exposure time is extended until the end of the last\nactive line.\n•The trigger pin needs to be kept low during the FOT.\nThe monitor pins can be used as a feedback to the\nFPGA/controller (eg. use monitor0, indicating the very\nfirst line when monitor_select = 0x5 − a new trigger can\nbe initiated after a rising edge on monitor0).\nTriggered Global Shutter (Slave)\nExposure or integration time is fully controlled by means\nof the trigger pin in slave mode. The registers fr_length,exposure and mult_timer are ignored by the sensor.\nA rising edge on the trigger pin indicates the start of the\nexposure time, while a falling edge initiates the transfer tothe pixel storage node and readout of the image array. In\nother words, the high time of the trigger pin indicates theintegration time, the period of the trigger pin indicates the\nframe time.\nThe use of the trigger during slave mode is shown in\nFigure 25.\nNotes:\n•The registers exposure, fr_length, and mult_timer are\nnot used in this mode.\n•The start of exposure time is synchronized to the start\nof a new line (during ROT) if the exposure period starts\nduring a frame readout. As a consequence, the effectivetime during which the image core is in a reset state is\nextended to the start of a new line.\n•If the trigger is de −asserted before the end of readout,\nthe exposure time is extended until the end of the last\nactive line.\n•The trigger pin needs to be kept low during the FOT.\nThe monitor pins can be used as a feedback to the\nFPGA/controller (eg. use monitor0, indicating the veryfirst line when monitor_select = 0x5 − a new trigger can\nbe initiated after a rising edge on monitor0).\nFigure 25.

This allows limiting data output for everyframe, which in turn allows increasing the frame rate. In\nglobal shutter mode, up to eight ROIs can be configured.\nWindow Configuration\nFigure 26 shows the four parameters defining a region of\ninterest (ROI).\nFigure 26. Region of Interest Configurationy-starty-end\nx-start/C8195/C8195/C8195/C8195/C8195/C8195/C8195/C8195/C8195/C8195\u2002x-endROI 0\n•x−start[7:0]\nx−start defines the x −starting point of the desired window.\nThe sensor reads out 8 pixels in one single clock cycle. Asa consequence, the granularity for configuring the x −start\nposition is also 8 pixels for no sub sampling. The valueconfigured in the x −start register is multiplied by 8 to find\nthe corresponding column in the pixel array.\n•x−end[7:0]\nThis register defines the window end point on the x −axis.\nSimilar to x −start, the granularity for this configuration is\none kernel. x −end needs to be larger than x −start.\n•y−start[9:0]\nThe starting line of the readout window. The granularity\nof this setting is one line, except with color sensors where itneeds to be an even number.\n•y−end[9:0]\nThe end line of the readout window. y −end must be\nconfigured larger than y −start. This setting has the same\ngranularity as the y −start configuration.\nUp to eight windows can be defined, possibly (partially)\noverlapping, as illustrated in Figure 27.Figure 27. Overlapping Multiple Window\nConfigurationy0_starty1_starty0_endy1_end\nx0_start\nx1_startx0_end\nx1_endROI 0ROI 1\nThe sequencer analyses each line that need to be read out\nfor multiple windows.\nRestrictions\nThe following restrictions for each line are assumed for\nthe user configuration:\n•Windows are ordered from left to right, based on their\nx−start address:\nx_start_roi(i) x_start_roi(j) AND /C0118\nx_end_roi(i) x_end_roi(j) /C0118\nWhere j i >\nProcessing Multiple Windows\nThe sequencer control block houses two sets of counters\nto construct the image frame. As previously described, they−counter indicates the line that needs to be read out and is\nincremented at the end of each line. For the start of the frame,\nit is initialized to the y −start address of the first window and\nit runs until the y −end address of the last window to be read\nout. The last window is configured by the configuration\nregisters and it is not necessarily window #7.\nThe x−counter starts counting from the x −start address of\nthe window with the lowest ID which is active on theaddressed line. Only windows for which the currenty−address is enclosed are taken into account for scanning.\nOther windows are skipped.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n27Figure 28 illustrates a practical example of a\nconfiguration with five windows. The current position of the\nread pointer (ys) is indicated by a red line crossing the image\narray. For this position of the read pointer, three windows\nneed to be read out. The initial start position for the x −kernel\npointer is the x −start configuration of ROI1. Kernels are\nscanned up to the ROI3 x −end position. From there, the\nx−pointer jumps to the next window, which is ROI4 in this\nillustration. When reaching ROI4’s x −end position, the read\npointer is incremented to the next line and xs is reinitialized\nto the starting position of ROI1.\nNotes:\n•The starting point for the readout pointer at the start of\na frame is the y −start position of the first active\nwindow.•The read pointer is not necessarily incremented by one,\nbut depending on the configuration, it can jump in\ny−direction. In Figure 28, this is the case when reaching\nthe end of ROI0 where the read pointer jumps to they−start position of ROI1\n•The x−pointer starting position is equal to the x −start\nconfiguration of the first active window on the current\nline addressed. This window is not necessarily window\n#0.\n•The x−pointer is not necessarily incremented by one\neach cycle. At the end of a window it can jump to the\nstart of the next window.\n•Each window can be activated separately. There is no\nrestriction on which window and how many of the 8\nwindows are active.\nFigure 28. Scanning the Image Array with Five WindowsROI 0ROI 1ROI 4\nysROI 3ROI 2\nSubsampling\nSubsampling is used to reduce the image resolution. This\nallows increasing the frame rate. Two subsampling modesare supported: for monochrome and NIR enhanced sensors(P1−SN/FN, P2 −SN and P3 −SN/FN) and color sensors\n(P1−SE / P2−SE / P3−SE).\nMonochrome and NIR Sensors\nThese sensors utilize the read −1−skip−1 subsampling\nscheme. Subsampling occurs both in x− and y− direction.Color Sensors\nFor color sensors, the read −2−skip−2 subsampling\nscheme is used. Subsampling occurs both in x − and y−\ndirection. Figure 29 shows which pixels are read and which\nones are skipped.\nFigure 29. Subsampling Scheme for Monochrome and Color Sensors\n\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n28Binning\nPixel binning is a technique in which different pixels\nbelonging to a rectangular bin are averaged in the analogdomain. Two −by−two pixel binning is available with the\nmonochrome and NIR enhanced image sensors (P1 −SN/FN,\nP2−SN, P3−SN/FN). This implies that two adjacent pixels\nare averaged both in column and row. Binning is\nconfigurable using a register setting. Pixel binning is notsupported on PYTHON color option (P1 −SE / P2−SE /\nP3−SE) and in Zero ROT mode.\nNOTES:\n1. Register 194[13:12] needs to be configured to 0x0\nfor 2x2 pixel binning and to 0x1 for 2x1 binning.\nBinning occurs only in x direction.\n2. Binning in y-direction cannot be used in\ncombination with pipelined integration andreadout. The integration time and readout timeshould be separated in time (do not coincide).\nReverse Readout in Y −direction\nReverse readout in y −direction can be done by toggling\nreverse_y (reg 194[8]). The reference for y_start and y_end\npointers is reversed.\nBlack Reference\nThe sensor reads out one or more black lines at the start of\nevery new frame. The number of black lines to be generatedis programmable and is minimal equal to 1. The length of the\nblack lines depends on the operation mode. The sensoralways reads out the entire line (160 kernels), independent\nof window configurations.\nThe black references are used to perform black calibration\nand offset compensation in the data channels. The raw black\npixel data is transmitted over the usual output interface,while the regular image data is compensated (can bebypassed).\nOn the output interface, black lines can be seen as a\nseparate window, however without Frame Start and Ends(only Line Start/End). The Sync code following the LineStart and Line End indications (“window ID”) contains the\nactive window number, which is 0. Black reference data is\nclassified by a BL code.\nSignal Path Gain\nAnalog Gain Stages\nReferring to Table 12, three gain settings are available in\nthe analog data path to apply gain to the analog signal before\nit is digitized. The gain amplifier can apply a gain of\napproximately 1x to 4x to the analog signal.\nThe moment a gain reconfiguration is applied and\nbecomes valid can be controlled by the gain_lat_compconfiguration.\nWith ‘gain_lat_comp’ set to ‘0’, the new gain\nconfigurations are applied from the very next frame.\nWith ‘gain_lat_comp’ se t to ‘1’, the new gain settings are\npostponed by one extra frame. This feature is useful when\nexposure time and gain are reconfigured together, as anexposure time update always has one frame latency.\nTable 12.

The gain configuration is an absolute 5.7unsigned number (5 digits before and 7 digits after the\ndecimal point).\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n29Automatic Exposure Control\nThe exposure control mechanism has the shape of a\ngeneral feedback control system. Figure 30 shows the highlevel block diagram of the exposure control loop.\nFigure 30.

Based on the difference between thecalculated illumination and the target illumination thestatistics block requests a relative gain change.\nStatistics Subsampling and Windowing\nFor average calculation, the statistics block will\nsub−sample the current image or windows by taking every\nfourth sample into account. Note that only the pixels read out\nthrough the active windows are visible for the AEC. In thecase where multiple windows are active, the samples will be\nselected from the total samples. Samples contained in a\nregion covered by multiple (overlapping) window will be\ntaking into account only once.\nIt is possible to define an AEC specific sub −window on\nwhich the AEC will calculate it’s average. For instance, the\nsensor can be configured to read out a larger frame, while the\nillumination is measured on a smaller region of interest, e.g.\ncenter weighted as shown in Table 13.\nTable 13. AEC SAMPLE SELECTION\nRegister Name Description\n192[10] roi_aec_enable When 0x0, all active windows are selected for statistics calculation.\nWhen 0x1, the AEC samples are selected from the active pixels contained in the region of interest defined\nby roi_aec\n253−255 roi_aec These registers define a window from which the AEC samples will be selected when roi_aec_enable is\nasserted. Configuration is similar to the regular region of interests.\nThe intersection of this window with the active windows define the selected pixels. It is important that thiswindow at least overlaps with one or more active windows.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n30Target Illumination\nThe target illumination value is configured by means of\nregister desired_intensity  as shown in Table 14.\nTable 14.

Note these scale factor are\nonly used to calculate the statistics in order to compensatefor (off−chip) white balancing and/or color matrices. The\npixel values itself are not modified.\nThe scale factors are configured as 3.7 unsigned numbers\n(0x80 = unity). Refer to T able 15 for color scale factors. For\nmono sensors, configure these factors to their default value.\nTable 15.

Small adjustments are regula ted by digital gain\nonly.\n•Exposure Time\nThe exposure is the time between the global image array\nreset de−assertion and the pixel charge transfer. The\ngranularity of the integration time steps is configured by the\nmult_timer  register.\nNOTE: The exposure_time  register is ignored when the\nAEC is enabled. The register fr_length  defines\nthe frame time and needs to be configuredaccordingly.\n•Analog Gain\nThe sensor has two analog gain stages, configurable\nindependently from each other. T ypically the AEC shall only\nregulate the first stage.\n•Digital Gain\nThe last gain stage is a gain applied on the digitized\nsamples. The digital gain is represented by a 5.7 unsignednumber (i.e. 7 bits after the decimal point). While the analog\ngain steps are coarse, the digital gain stage makes it possible\nto achieve very fine adjustments.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n31AEC Control Range\nThe control range for each of the exposure parameters can\nbe pre−programmed in the sensor.

The Tsensor output is a 8 −bit digital count\nbetween 0 and 255, proportional to the temperature of the\nsilicon substrate. This reading can be translated directly to\na temperature reading in °C by calibrating the 8 −bit readout\nat 0°C and 85 °C to achieve an output accuracy of ±2°C. The\nTsensor output can also be calibrated using a singletemperature point (example: room temperature or theambient temperature of the application), to achieve anoutput accuracy of ±5°C.\nNote that any process variation will result in an offset in\nthe bit count and that offset will remain within ±5°C over the\ntemperature range of 0 °C and 85 °C. Tsensor output digital\ncode can be read out through the SPI interface.\nOutput of the temperature sensor to the SPI:\ntempd_reg_temp<7:0>: This is the 8 −bit N count readout\nproportional to temperature.\nInput from the SPI:\nThe reg_tempd_enable is a global enable and this enables\nor disables the temperature sensor when logic high or logiclow respectively. The temperature sensor is reset or disabled\nwhen the input reg_tempd_enable is set to a digital low state.\nCalibration using one temperature point\nThe temperature sensor resolution is fixed for a given type\nof package for the operating range of 0 °C to +85 °C and\nhence devices can be calibrated at any ambient temperature\nof the application, with the device configured in the mode ofoperation.\nInterpreting the actual temperature for the digital code\nreadout:\nThe formula used is\nTJ = R (Nread − Ncalib) + Tcalib\nTJ = junction die temperature\nR = resolution in degrees/LSB (typical 0.75 deg/LSB)Nread = Tsensor output (LSB count between 0 and 255)Tcalib = Tsensor calibration temperature\nNcalib = Tsensor output reading at Tcalib\nMonitor Pins\nThe internal sequencer has two monitor outputs (Pin 44\nand Pin 45) that can be used to communicate the internal\nstates from the sequencer. A three −bit register configures the\nassignment of the pins as shown in Table 19.\nTable 19.

Referringto Table 21, the four data channels on the P1 option are usedto output the image data only, while on the P3 option, two\ndata channel channels are utilized. The sync channel\ntransmits information about the data sent over these datachannels (includes codes indicating black pixels, normalpixels, and CRC codes).\n8−bit / 10−bit Mode\nThe sensor can be used in 8 −bit or 10−bit mode.\nIn 10−bit mode, the words on data and sync channel have\na 10−bit length. The output data rate is 720 Mbps.\nIn 8−bit mode, the words on data and sync channel have\nan 8−bit length, the output data rate is 576 Mbps.\nNote that the 8−bit mode can only be used to limit the data\nrate at the consequence of image data word depth. It is notsupported to operate the sensor in 8 −bit mode at a higher\nclock frequency to achieve higher frame rates.\nThe P1 option supports 10 −bit/8−bit in ZROT/NROT\nmode, while the P3 option supports 10 −bit NROT mode\nonly.Frame Format\nThe frame format in 8 −bit mode is identical to the 10 −bit\nmode with the exception that the Sync and data word depthis reduced to eight bits.\nThe frame format in 10 −bit mode is explained by example\nof the readout of two (overlapping) windows as shown in\nFigure 31(a).\nThe readout of a frame occurs on a line −by−line basis. The\nread pointer goes from left to right, bottom to top.\nFigure 31 indicates that, after the FOT is completed, the\nsensor reads out a number of black lines for black calibration\npurposes. After these black lines, the windows areprocessed. First a number of lines which only includesinformation of ‘ROI 0’ are sent out, starting at position\ny0_start. When the line at position y1_start is reached, a\nnumber of lines containing data of ‘ROI 0’ and ‘ROI 1’ are\nsent out, until the line position of y0_end is reached. Fromthere on, only data of ‘ROI 1’ appears on the data outputchannels until line position y1_end is reached\nDuring read out of the image data over the data channels,\nthe sync channel sends out frame synchronization codeswhich give information related to the image data that is sent\nover the four data output channels.\nEach line of a window starts with a Line Start (LS)\nindication and ends with a Line End (LE) indication. Theline start of the first line is replaced by a Frame Start (FS);the line end of the last line is replaced with a Frame Endindication (FE). Each such frame synchronization code isfollowed by a window ID (range 0 to 7). For overlappingwindows, the line synchronization codes of the overlapping\nwindows with lower IDs are not sent out (as shown in the\nillustration: no LE/FE is transmitted for the overlapping part\nof window 0).\nNOTE: In Figure 31, only Frame Start and Frame End\nSync words are indicated in (b). CRC codes arealso omitted from the figure.\nFor additional information on the\nsynchronization codes, please refer toApplication Note AND5001.\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n36Figure 31.

Note that the table shows the default data word(configurable) for 10−bit mode. If more than one window isactive at the same time, the sync channel transmits the frame\nsynchronization codes of the window with highest indexonly.\nTable 20.

This is an integer\nnumber, ranging from 0 to 7, indicating the active window.If more than one window is active for the current cycle, thehighest window ID is transmitted.•Data Classification Codes\nFor the remaining cycles, the sync channel indicates the\ntype of data sent through the data links: black pixel data(BL), image data (IMG), or training pattern (TR). Thesecodes are programmable by a register setting. The defaultvalues are listed in Table 21.\nTable 21.

The sync channel sends out the training pattern which can be programmed by a register setting.\nFrame Synchronization in 8 −bit Mode\nThe frame synchronization words are configured using\nthe same registers as in 10 −bit mode. The two least\nsignificant bits of these configuration registers are ignoredand not sent out. Table 32 shows the structure of the frame\nsynchronization code, together with the default value, asspecified in SPI registers. The same restriction for\noverlapping windows applies in 8 −bit mode.\nTable 22.

The window ID is located in bits 4:2 (all other\nbit positions are ‘0’). The same restriction for overlappingwindows applies in 8 −bit mode.•Data Classification Codes\nBL, IMG, CRC, and TR codes are defined by the same\nregisters as in 10 −bit mode. Bits 9:2 of the respective\nconfiguration registers are used as classification code withdefault values shown in Table 23.\nTable 23.

These training patterns are configurable\nindependent of the training code on the sync channel asshown in Table 24.\nTable 24.

Each data channeltransmits a CRC code to protect the data words sent during\nthe previous cycles. Idle and training patterns are notincluded in the calculation.\nThe sync channel is not protected. A special character\n(CRC indication) is transmitted whenever the data channels\nsend their respective CRC code.\nThe polynomial in 10 −bit operation mode is\nx\n10+x9+x6+x3+x2+ x + 1. The CRC encoder is seeded\nat the start of a new line and updated for every (valid) dataword received. The CRC seed is configurable using thecrc_seed register. When ‘0’, the CRC is seeded by all −‘0’;\nwhen ‘1’ it is seeded with all −‘1’.\nIn 8−bit mode, the polynomial is x\n8+x6+x3+x2+1 .\nThe CRC seed is configured by means of the crc_seedregister.\nNOTE: The CRC is calculated for every line. This\nimplies that the CRC code can protect lines from\nmultiple windows.LVDS Output Multiplexing\nThe PYTHON300, PYTHON500 and PYTHON1300\nimage sensors contain a function for down −multiplexing the\noutput channels. Using this function, one may for instanceuse the device with 2 or 1 data channels instead of 4 datachannels.\nEnabling the channel multiplexing is done through\nregister 32[5:4]. The default value of 0x0 disables allchannel multiplexing. Higher values sets a higher degree of\nchannel multiplexing. Note that the Sync identificationcodes are repeated multiple times depending on themultiplex factor. The channels that are used per degree ofmultiplexing and the number of Sync Code repetitions areshown in Table 26. The unused data channels are powered\ndown and will not send any data.\nTable 26.

The kernel size iseight pixels in x −direction by one pixel in y −direction. Thedata order in 8 −bit mode is identical to the 10 −bit mode.\nFigure 35 indicates how the kernels are organized. The first\nkernel (kernel [0, 0]) is located in the bottom left corner. The\ndata order of this image data on the data output channels\ndepends on the subsampling mode.\nFigure 35.

A CMOS clock output, ‘frame valid’ and ‘linevalid’ signal synchronizes the output data.\nNo windowing information is sent out by the sensor.\n8−bit/10−bit Mode\nThe 8−bit mode is not supported when using the parallel\nCMOS output interface.\nFrame Format\nFrame timing is indicated by means of two signals:\nframe_valid and line_valid.•The frame_valid indication is asserted at the start of a\nnew frame and remains asserted until the last line of the\nframe is completely transmitted.\n•The line_valid indication serves the following needs:\n♦While the line_valid indication is asserted, the data\nchannels contain valid pixel data.\n♦The line valid communicates frame timing as it is\nasserted at the start of each line and it is de −asserted\nat the end of the line. Low periods indicate the idletime between lines (ROT).\n♦The data channels transmit the calculated CRC code\nafter each line. This can be detected as the datawords right after the falling edge of the line valid.\nFigure 45.

The\nread pointer goes from left to right, bottom to top. Figure 46\n(a) and (b) indicate that, after the FOT is finished, a numberof lines which include information of ‘ROI 0’ are sent out,starting at position y0_start. When the line at position\ny1_start is reached, a number of lines containing data of‘ROI 0’ and ‘ROI 1’ are sent out, until the line position of\ny0_end is reached. Then, only data of ‘ROI 1’ appears on the\ndata output until line position y1_end is reached. Theline_valid strobe is not shown in Figure 46.\nFigure 46.

To\ndistinguish these pixels from the regular image data, it ispossible to ‘mute’ the frame and/or line valid indications for\nthe black lines. Refer to T able 27 for black line, frame_valid\nand line_valid settings.\nTable 27.

The frame valid indication is asserted\nbefore the first black line and the line valid indication is asserted for every valid (black) pixel.\n0x1 0x0 The frame valid indication is asserted before the first black line, but the line valid indication is notasserted for the black lines. The line valid indication indicates the valid image pixels only. This\nmode is useful when one does not use the black pixels and when the frame valid indication needsto be asserted some time before the first image lines (for example, to precondition ISP pipelines).\n0x0 0x1 In this mode, the black pixel data is clearly unambiguously indicated by the line valid indication,\nwhile the decoding of the real image data is simplified.\n0x0 0x0 Black lines are not indicated and frame and line valid strobes remain de −asserted. Note  however\nthat the data channels contains the black pixel data and CRC codes (Training patterns are \ninterrupted).\nNOIP1SN1300A\nwww. onsemi.com\n47Data order for P2 −SN/SE: CMOS Interface Version\nTo read out the image data through the parallel CMOS\noutput, the pixel array is divided in kernels. The kernel size\nis eight pixels in x −direction by one pixel in y −direction.\nFigure 35 on page 40 indicates how the kernels areorganized.\nThe data order of this image data on the data output\nchannels depends on the subsampling mode.•P2−SN/SE: No Subsampling\nThe image data is read out in kernels of eight pixels in\nx−direction by one pixel in y−direction.\nFigure 47 shows the pixel sequence of a kernel which is\nread out over the single CMOS output channel.
