Patented temperature drift curvature correction techniques minimize nonlinearity of the voltage change with temperature. The wide operating range and low power consumption make \nthem ideal for 3 V to 5 V battery-powered applications.  \nThe ADR380 and ADR381 are micropower, low dropout \nvoltage (LDV) devices that provid e a stable output voltage from \nsupplies as low as 300 mV above the output voltage. They are \nspecified over the industrial (−40°C to +85°C) temperature \nrange. The ADR380/ADR381 are available in the tiny 3-lead \nSOT-23 package. Table 1.

C | Page 11 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION \nBand gap references are the high performance solution for low \nsupply voltage and low power voltage reference applications, and the ADR380/ADR381 are no exception. However, the uniqueness of this product lies in its architecture. As shown in Figure 26 , \nthe ideal zero TC band gap voltage is referenced to the output, not to ground. The band gap cell consists of the PNP pair Q51 and Q52, running at unequal current densities. The difference in V\nBE results in a voltage with a positive TC that is amplified  \nby the ratio of 2 × R58/R54. This PTAT voltage, combined with \nthe V BE of Q51 and Q52, produce the stable band gap voltage. \nReduction in the band gap curvature is performed by the ratio \nof the two resistors, R44 and R59. Precision laser trimming and other patented circuit techniques are used to further enhance \nthe drift performance. \nGNDVOUTVIN\nQ1\nR59\nR54\nQ51\nR60 R61R48R49R44\nR58\nR53 Q52\n– +\n02175-026 \nFigure 26. Simplified Schematic DEVICE POWER DISSIPATION CONSIDERATIONS \nThe ADR380/ADR381 are capable of delivering load currents to \n5 mA with an input voltage that ranges from 2.8 V (ADR381 only) \nto 15 V . When this device is used in applications with large input voltages, take care to avoid exceeding the specified maximum \npower dissipation or junction temperature that may result in \npremature device failure. Use the following formula to calculate \na device’s maximum junction temperature or dissipation: \nJAA J\nDT TPθ−=  \nwhere: \nPD is the device power dissipation, \nTJ and TA are junction and ambient temperatures, respectively. \nθJA is the device package thermal resistance. \nINPUT CAPACITOR \nAn input capacitor is not required on the ADR380/ADR381. \nThere is no limit for the value of the capacitor used on the input, \nbut a capacitor on the input improves transient response in applications where the load current suddenly increases. \nOUTPUT CAPACITOR \nThe ADR380/ADR381 do not need an output capacitor for \nstability under any load condition. Using an output capacitor, \ntypically 0.1 μF, removes any very low level noise voltage and does not affect the operation of the part. The only parameter that degrades by applying an output capacitor is turn-on time. (This varies depending on the size of the capacitor.) Load transient \nresponse is also improved with an output capacitor, which acts \nas a source of stored energy for a sudden increase in load current. \n \n \nADR380/ADR381  \n \nRev. C | Page 12 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nSTACKING REFERENCE ICs FOR ARBITRARY \nOUTPUTS \nSome applications may require two reference voltage sources, \nwhich are a combined sum of standard outputs. The following \ncircuit shows how this stacked output reference can be implemented: \nGNDVOUT VIN\n3\nGNDVOUT VINC2\n1µFC1\n0.1µF\nC3\n0.1µFC41µF\n3R13.9kΩV\nOUT2\nVOUT122 1\n1VIN\nU2\nADR380/\nADR381\nU1\nADR380/\nADR381\n02175-027 \nFigure 27. Stacking Voltage References with the ADR380/ADR381 \nTwo ADR380s or ADR381s are used; the outputs of the individ-\nual references are simply cascaded to reduce the supply current. Such configuration provides two output voltages: V\nOUT1 and \nVOUT2. V OUT1 is the terminal voltage of U1, while V OUT2 is the \nsum of this voltage and the terminal voltage of U2. U1 and U2 \ncan be chosen for the two different voltages that supply the \nrequired outputs. \nWhile this concept is simple, a precaution is in order. Because \nthe lower reference circuit must sink a small bias current from U2, plus the base current from the series PNP output transistor in U2, the external load of either U1 or R1 must provide a path for this current. If the U1 minimum load is not well-defined, \nResistor R1 should be used, set to a value that conservatively \npasses 600 μA of current with the applicable V\nOUT1 across it. Note \nthat the two U1 and U2 reference circuits are locally treated as macrocells, each having its own bypasses at input and output for optimum stability. Both U1 and U2 in this circuit can source dc \ncurrents up to their full rating. The minimum input voltage, V\nIN, is \ndetermined by the sum of the outputs, V OUT2, plus the 300 mV \ndropout voltage of U2. \nA NEGATIVE PRECISION REFERENCE WITHOUT \nPRECISION RESISTORS \nIn many current-output CMOS DAC applications where the \noutput signal voltage must be of the same polarity as the \nreference voltage, it is often required to reconfigure a current-\nswitching DAC into a voltage-switching DAC through the use \nof a 1.25 V reference, an op amp, and a pair of resistors. Using  a current switching DAC directly requires an additional opera-tional amplifier at the output to reinvert the signal. A negative voltage reference is then desirable from the point that an additional \noperational amplifier is not required for either reinversion (current-switching mode) or amplification (voltage-switching \nmode) of the DAC output voltage. In general, any positive voltage reference can be converted into a negative voltage reference through the use of an operational amplifier and a pair of matched \nresistors in an inverting configuration. The disadvantage to this \napproach is that the largest single source of error in the circuit is \nthe relative matching of the resistors used. \nThe circuit in Figure 28  avoids the need for tightly matched \nresistors with the use of an active integrator circuit. In this \ncircuit, the output of the voltage reference provides the input drive for the integrator. The integrator, to maintain circuit \nequilibrium, adjusts its output to establish the proper relation-\nship between the reference V\nOUT and GND. Thus, any negative \noutput voltage desired can be chosen by substituting for the appropriate reference IC. A precaution should be noted with this approach: although rail-to-rail output amplifiers work best in the application, these operational amplifiers require a finite \namount (mV) of headroom when required to provide any load \ncurrent. The choice for the circuit’s negative supply should take \nthis issue into account. \nGNDVOUT VIN\nC2\n0.1µF\n3+5V\n–VREFVIN2\nA11\nU2\n–5VOP195–V+VC1\n1µFU1\nADR380/\nADR381R4\n1kΩ\nR3\n100kΩC3\n1µFC4\n1µF\nR5\n100Ω\n02175-028 \nFigure 28. Negative Precision Voltage Reference Using No Precision Resistors \nPRECISION CURRENT SOURCE \nMany times in low power applications, the need arises for a \nprecision current source that can operate on low supply voltages. \nAs shown in Figure 29 , the ADR380/ADR381 can be configured \nas a precision current source. The circuit configuration illustrated is a floating current source with a grounded load. The reference \noutput voltage is bootstrapped across R\nSET (R1 + P1), which sets \nthe output current into the load. With this configuration, circuit \nprecision is maintained for load currents in the range from the \nreference supply current, typically 90 μA to approximately 5 mA. \nGNDVOUT VIN\n3VIN2\nR11\nRLP1\nIOUTISY\nADJUSTU1\nADR380/\nADR381C3\n1µFC1\n1µFC2\n0.1µF\n02175-029 \nFigure 29.

The accuracy for a reference is normally specified on the data sheet with no load. However, the output voltage changes with load current. \nThe circuit in Figure 30  provides high current without compromis-\ning the accuracy of the ADR380/ADR381. By op amp action, \nV\nOUT follows V REF with very low drop in R1. To maintain circuit \nequilibrium, the op amp also drives the N-Channel MOSFET Q1 into saturation to maintain the current needed at different loads. R2 is optional to prevent oscillation at Q1. In such an approach, hundreds of milliamps of load current can be achieved, \nand the current is limited by the thermal limitation of Q1. V\nIN = \nVOUT + 300 mV .
