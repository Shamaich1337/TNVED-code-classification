Gain versions of 15 dB and 20 dB are offered.\nThe AD8350 is designed to meet the demanding performance\nrequirements of communications transceiver ap plications. It\nenables a high dynamic range differential signal chain, withexceptional linearity and increased common-mode rejection.The device can be used as a general purpose gain block, an\nA-to-D driver, and high speed data interface driver, among\nother functions. The AD8350 input can also be used as a single-ended-to-differential converter.The a mplifier can be operated down to 5 V with an OIP3 of\n+28 dBm at 250 MHz and slightly reduced distor tion perfor-\nmance. The wide bandwidth, high dynamic range and tempe rature\nstability make this product ideal for the various RF and IFfrequencies required in cellular, CATV, broadband, instrumen-\ntation and other applications.\nThe AD8350 is offered in an 8-lead single SOIC package and\nμSOIC package. It operates from 5 V and 10 V power supplies,\ndrawing 28 mA typical. The AD8350 offers a power enable func-\ntion for pow er-sensitive applications. The AD8350 is fabricated\nusing Analog Devices’ proprietary high speed complementary\nbipolar process.

The power\nsupply pin should be decoupled using a 0.1 μF capacitor. The\nENBL pin is tied to the positive supply or to 5 V (when V CC =\n10 V) for normal operation and should be pulled to gr ound to\nput the device in sleep mode. Both the inputs and the o utputs\nhave dc bias levels at midsupply and should be ac-coupled.\nAlso shown in Figure 1 are the impedance balancing requireme nts,\neither resistive or reactive, of the input and o utput. With an\ninput and output impedance of 200 Ω, the AD8350 should be\ndriven by a 200 Ω source and loaded by a 200 Ω impedance. A\nreactive match can also be implemented.\n8 7 6 5\n1 2 3 4AD8350\n+–\nENBL (5V)\n+VS (5V TO 10V)C5\n0.1/H9262FC4\n0.001/H9262F\nC3\n0.001/H9262FLOAD\nZ = 200/H9024C2\n0.001/H9262F\nC1\n0.001/H9262FSOURCE\nZ = 100/H9024\nZ = 100/H9024\nFigure 1.

The unused input should be ac-coupled to ground.\nWhen driven single-endedly, there will be a slight imbalance in\nthe differential output voltages. This will cause an increase in\nthe second order harmonic distortion (at 50 MHz, with V CC =\n10 V and V OUT = 1 V p-p, –59 dBc was measured for the second\nharmonic on AD8350-15).\n8 7 6 5\n1 2 3 4AD8350\n+–\nENBL (5V)\n+VS (5V TO 10V)C5\n0.1/H9262FC4\n0.001/H9262F\nC3\n0.001/H9262FLOAD\nZ = 200/H9024C2\n0.001/H9262F\nSOURCE\nZ = 200/H9024 C1\n0.001/H9262F\nFigure 2. Basic Connections for Single-Ended Drive\nReactive Matching\nIn practical applications, the AD8350 will most likely be matched\nusing reactive matching components as shown in Figure 3.\nMatching components can be calculated using a Smith Chart or\nby using a resonant approach to determine the matching network\nthat results in a complex conjugate match. In either situation,\nthe circuit can be analyzed as a single-ended equivalent circuit\nto ease calculations as shown in Figure 4.VS876 5\n1234AD8350\n+–\nENBL (5V)\n+VS (5V TO 10V)0.1/H9262FRLOADCAC\nCACCPLS/2\nLS/2RS/2\nRS/2CAC\nCACCPLS/2\nLS/2\nFigure 3.

Single-Ended Equivalent Circuit\nWhen the source impedance is smaller than the load impedance,a step-up matching network is required. A typical step-up networkis shown on the input of the AD8350 in Figure 3. For purely\nresistive source and load impedances the reso nant approach may\nbe used. The input and output impedance of the AD8350 can be\nmodeled as a real 200 Ω resistance for operating frequencies less\nthan 100 MHz. For signal frequencies exceeding 100 MHz, classi-\ncal Smith Chart matching techniques should be invoked in order\nto deal with the complex impedance relationships. Detailed S\nparameter data measured differentially in a 200 Ω system can be\nfound in Tables II and III.\nFor the input matching network the source resistance is less\nthan the input resistance of the AD8350. The AD8350 has a\nnominal 200 Ω input resistance from Pins 1 to 8. The reactance\nof the ac-coupling capacitors, C\nAC, should be negligible if 100 nF\ncapacitors are used and the lowest signal frequency is greater\nthan 1 MHz.

Figure 5 shows the normalized shunt reactance\nversus the normalized source resistance for a ste p-up matching\nnetwork, R S < R LOAD. By inspection, the appropriate reactance\ncan be found for a given value of R S/RLOAD. The series reactance\nis then calculated using X S = R S RLOAD/XP.

Normalized Step-Down Matching ComponentsThe same results could be found using a Smith Chart as shown\nin Figure 7. In this example, a shunt capacitor and a series inductorare used to match the 200 Ω source to a 50 Ω load. For a fre-\nquency of 10 MHz, the same capacitor and inductor values\npreviously found using the resonant approach will transform the200 Ω source to match the 50 Ω load. At frequencies exceeding\n100 MHz, the S parameters from Tables II and III should be\nused to account for the complex impedance relationships.\nSOURCE LOAD\nSHUNT C\nSERIES L\nFigure 7. Smith Chart Representation of Step-Down Network\nAfter determining the matching network for the single-ended\nequivalent circuit, the matching elements need to be applied in adifferential manner. The series reactance needs to be split such\nthat the final network is balanced. In the previous examples, this\nsimply translates to splitting the series ind uctor into two equal\nhalves as shown in Figure 3.\nGain Adjustment\nThe effective gain of the AD8350 can be reduced using a num-\nber of techniques. Obviously a matched attenuator network will\nreduce the effective gain, but this requires the addition of aseparate component which can be prohibitive in size and cost.\nThe attenuator will also increase the effective noise figure resu lting\nin an SNR degradation. A simple voltage divider can be imple-\nmented using the combination of the driving impedance of the\nprevious stage and a shunt resistor across the inputs of the AD8350\nas shown in Figure 8. This provides a compact solution butsuffers from an increased noise spectral density at the input\nof the AD8350 due to the thermal noise contribution of the\nshunt resistor. The input impedance can be dynamically altered\nthrough the use of feedback resistors as shown in Figure 9. This\nwill result in a similar attenuation of the input signal by virtue\nof the voltage divider established from the driving source imped-ance and the reduced input impedance of the AD8350. Yet\nthis technique does not significantly degrade the SNR with\nthe unn ecessary increase in thermal noise that arises from a truly\nresistive attenuator network.\n C\nREV.AD8350\n–10–VS876 5\n1234AD8350\n+–\nENBL (5V)\n+VS (5V TO 10V)0.1/H9262FCAC\nRSCAC\nCAC CACRSHUNT\nRSHUNTRSRL\nRL\nFigure 8.

Dynamic Gain Reduction\nFigure 8 shows a typical implementation of the shunt divider\nconcept. The reduced input impedance that results from theparallel combination of the shunt resistor and the input impedance\nof the AD8350 adds attenuation to the input signal effectively\nreducing the gain. For frequencies less than 100 MHz, the input\nimpedance of the AD8350 can be modeled as a real 200 Ω resis-\ntance (differential). Assuming the frequency is low enough toignore the shunt react ance of the input, and high enough such\nthat the reactance of moderately sized ac-coupling capacitors\ncan be considered negligible, the insertion loss, IL, due to the\nshunt divider can be expressed as:\nIL dB LogR\nRR\nRR\nRR R\nRRRR\nRRR gl ndedIN\nIN S\nIN SHUNT\nIN SHUNT S\nIN SHUNTIN SHUNT\nIN SHUNTIN()()\n()=×+\n+⎡\n⎣⎢\n⎢⎢⎢⎤\n⎦⎥\n⎥⎥⎥\n=×\n+=−20\n10010/H20648\n/H20648\n/H20648where\nand Ωsin e e(3)The insertion loss and the resultant power gain for multiple\nshunt resistor values is summarized in Table I.

Gain for Multiple Values of Shunt Resistance\nfor Circuit in Figure 8\nThe gain can be adjusted dynamically by employing external\nfeedback resistors as shown in Figure 9. The effective attenua-\ntion is a result of the lowered input impedance as with the shunt\nresistor method, yet there is no additional noise contribution at\nthe input of the device. It is necessary to use well-matched resistorsto minimize common-mode offset errors. Quality 1% tolerance\nresistors should be used along with a symmetric board layout to\nhelp guarantee balanced performance.

Often it is desirable to try to achieve a\ncomplex conjugate match between the source and load in orderto minimize reflections and conserve power. But if the AD8350is driving a voltage responding device, such as an ADC, it is no\nlonger necessary to maximize power transfer. The harmonic\ndistortion performance will actually improve when driving\nloads greater than 200 Ω. The lighter load requires less cur-\nrent driving capability on the output stages of the AD8350resulting in im proved linearity.
