The differential receiver converts theanalog data on the bus lines into digital data which isoutputtopin RXDviathemultiplexer(MUX).Theslopeofthe output signals on the bus lines is fixed and optimizedin a way that lowest ElectroMagnetic Emission (EME) isguaranteed.\nS\nTANDBY MODE\nInthismodethetransmitterandreceiverareswitchedoff,\nandthelow-powerdifferentialreceiverwillmonitorthebuslines. A HIGH level on pin STB activates this low-powerreceiver and the wake-up filter, and after t\nBUS the state of\nthe CAN bus is reflected on pin RXD.\nThe supply current on V CC is reduced to a minimum in\nsuch a way that ElectroMagnetic Immunity (EMI) isguaranteed and a wake-up event on the bus lines will berecognized.\nIn this mode the bus lines are terminated to ground to\nreduce the supply current (I\nCC) to a minimum. A diode is\naddedinserieswiththehigh-sidedriverofRXDtopreventareversecurrentfromRXDtoV\nCCintheunpoweredstate.\nIn normal mode this diode is bypassed.

So a\nstart of transmission does not cause a step in thecommon-mode signal which would lead to poorElectroMagnetic Emission (EME) behaviour.\nWake-up\nIn the standby mode the bus lines are monitored via a\nlow-power differential comparator. Once the low-powerdifferentialcomparatorhasdetectedadominantbuslevelfor more than t\nBUS, pin RXD will become LOW.\nOver-temperature detection\nTheoutputdriversareprotectedagainstover-temperature\nconditions.IfthevirtualjunctiontemperatureexceedstheshutdownjunctiontemperatureT\nj(sd),theoutputdriverswill\nbedisableduntilthevirtualjunctiontemperaturebecomeslower than T\nj(sd) and TXD becomes recessive again.\nBy including the TXD condition, the occurrence of outputdriver oscillation due to temperature drifts is avoided.\nTXD dominant time-out function\nA ‘TXD dominant time-out’ timer circuit prevents the bus\nlines from being driven to a permanent dominant state(blocking all network communication) if pin TXD is forcedpermanently LOW by a hardware and/or softwareapplication failure. The timer is triggered by a negativeedge on pin TXD.\nIf the duration of the LOW level on pin TXD exceeds the\ninternal timer value (t\ndom), the transmitter is disabled,\ndriving the bus lines into a recessive state. The timer isreset by a positive edge on pin TXD.

Wave soldering can still be used forcertainsurfacemountICs,butitisnotsuitableforfinepitchSMDs. In these situations reflow soldering isrecommended.\nReﬂow soldering\nReflow soldering requires solder paste (a suspension of\nfinesolderparticles,fluxandbindingagent)tobeappliedtotheprinted-circuitboardbyscreenprinting,stencillingorpressure-syringe dispensing before package placement.Driven by legislation and environmental forces theworldwide use of lead-free solder pastes is increasing.\nSeveral methods exist for reflowing; for example,\nconvection or convection/infrared heating in a conveyortype oven. Throughput times (preheating, soldering andcooling) vary between 100 and200 seconds dependingon heating method.\nTypical reflow peak temperatures range from\n215 to270 °C depending on solder paste material. The\ntop-surface temperature of the packages shouldpreferably be kept:\n•below220 °C(SnPbprocess)orbelow245 °C(Pb-free\nprocess)\n– for all BGA and SSOP-T packages– for packages with a thickness ≥2.5 mm\n– for packages with a thickness < 2.5 mm and a\nvolume≥350 mm\n3 so called thick/large packages.\n•below235 °C(SnPbprocess)orbelow260 °C(Pb-free\nprocess)forpackageswithathickness< 2.5 mmandavolume < 350 mm\n3 so called small/thin packages.\nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on packing,\nmust be respected at all times.\nWave soldering\nConventional single wave soldering is not recommended\nforsurfacemountdevices(SMDs)orprinted-circuitboardswith a high component density, as solder bridging andnon-wetting can present major problems.To overcome these problems the double-wave soldering\nmethod was specifically developed.\nIfwavesolderingisusedthefollowingconditionsmustbe\nobserved for optimal results:\n•Use a double-wave soldering method comprising a\nturbulentwavewithhighupwardpressurefollowedbyasmooth laminar wave.\n•For packages with leads on two sides and a pitch (e):\n– larger than or equal to 1.27 mm, the footprint\nlongitudinal axis is preferred  to be parallel to the\ntransport direction of the printed-circuit board;\n– smaller than 1.27 mm, the footprint longitudinal axis\nmust be parallel to the transport direction of the\nprinted-circuit board.\nThe footprint must incorporate solder thieves at the\ndownstream end.\n•Forpackageswithleadsonfoursides,thefootprintmust\nbeplacedata45 °angletothetransportdirectionofthe\nprinted-circuit board. The footprint must incorporatesolder thieves downstream and at the side corners.\nDuringplacementandbeforesoldering,thepackagemust\nbe fixed with a droplet of adhesive. The adhesive can beapplied by screen printing, pin transfer or syringedispensing. The package can be soldered after theadhesive is cured.\nTypical dwell time of the leads in the wave ranges from\n3 to4 seconds at 250 °C or 265 °C, depending on solder\nmaterial applied, SnPb or Pb-free respectively.\nA mildly-activated flux will eliminate the need for removal\nof corrosive residues in most applications.\nManual soldering\nFix the component by first soldering two\ndiagonally-oppositeendleads.Usealowvoltage(24 Vorless) soldering iron applied to the flat part of the lead.Contact time must be limited to 10 seconds at up to300°C.\nWhen using a dedicated tool, all other leads can be\nsoldered in one operation within 2 to5 seconds between270and 320 °C.\n2003Oct 14 14Philips Semiconductors Product speciﬁcation\nHigh speed CAN transceiver TJA1040\nSuitability of surface mount IC packages for wave and reﬂow soldering methods\nNotes\n1.

On versions with the heatsink on the bottom side, the solder\ncannotpenetratebetweentheprinted-circuitboardandtheheatsink.Onversionswiththeheatsinkonthetopside,the solder might be deposited on the heatsink surface.\n5. If wave soldering is considered, then the package must be placed at a 45 ° angle to the solder wave direction.\nThe package footprint must incorporate solder thieves downstream and at the side corners.\n6.

### Component Summary: TJA1040T/CM

**Description:**
The TJA1040 is a high-speed CAN (Controller Area Network) transceiver designed for automotive applications. It serves as the interface between a CAN protocol controller and the physical bus, enabling differential transmit and receive capabilities. The device is optimized for high-speed communication up to 1 MBaud and features low power consumption, making it suitable for nodes that may operate in standby or power-down modes.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VCC): 4.75 to 5.25 V
  - DC Voltage on CANH, CANL, and SPLIT pins: -27 to +40 V
  - Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Voltage: 
    - CANH, CANL, SPLIT: -6 to +6 kV (Human Body Model)
    - Other Pins: -4 to +4 kV

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Supply Current (Standby Mode): 5 to 15 µA
  - Supply Current (Normal Mode):
    - Recessive: 2.5 to 10 mA
    - Dominant: 5 to 70 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Very low standby current (5 to 15 µA), making it energy-efficient for automotive applications.

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Virtual Junction Temperature (Tvj): -40 to +150 °C
  - Storage Temperature: -55 to +150 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - TJA1040T: SO8 (plastic small outline package; 8 leads; body width 3.9 mm)

- **Special Features:**
  - Fully compatible with ISO 11898 standard.
  - Very low electromagnetic emission (EME).
  - Remote wake-up capability via the bus.
  - Input levels compatible with both 3.3 V and 5 V devices.
  - At least 110 nodes can be connected.
  - Transmitter dominant time-out function to prevent bus lock-up.
  - Thermal protection and short-circuit proof bus pins.

- **Moisture Sensitive Level:**
  - According to JEDEC J-STD-020E, the TJA1040 is classified as moisture sensitive.

**Typical Applications:**
The TJA1040 is primarily used in automotive applications for:
- **Power Management:** Efficiently managing power in nodes that may enter standby mode.
- **Signal Processing:** Facilitating high-speed communication between various automotive control units.
- **Data Communication:** Enabling reliable data transfer in CAN networks, which are widely used in vehicles for communication between microcontrollers and devices.

This transceiver is particularly beneficial in applications where low power consumption and high reliability are critical, such as in modern automotive systems that require robust communication protocols.
