#### Description:
The TGA2533 is a Ku-Band Power Amplifier designed for high-frequency applications, specifically operating in the frequency range of 12.7 to 15.4 GHz. It utilizes Qorvo's advanced power pHEMT (pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor) technology, which allows for high efficiency and performance in RF applications. The amplifier is capable of delivering a typical output power of 34 dBm at 1 dB gain compression and a third-order intercept point (TOI) of 43 dBm.

#### Typical Applications:
The TGA2533 is primarily used in:
- **Point-to-Point Radio:** It is suitable for communication links that require high-frequency transmission over short distances.
- **Ku-Band VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal):** This amplifier is ideal for ground terminal applications in satellite communications, where reliable and efficient signal amplification is crucial.

This component is particularly valuable in systems that demand high linearity and low noise figures, making it a preferred choice for modern communication systems operating in the Ku-band frequency range.
