The ESD clamping voltageis the voltage drop across the ESD protection diode duringan ESD event per the IEC61000−4−2 waveform. Since theIEC61000−4−2 was written as a pass/fail spec for largersystems such as cell phones or laptop computers it is not\nclearly defined in the spec how to specify a clamping voltage\nat the device level. ON Semiconductor has developed a way\nto examine the entire voltage waveform across the ESD\nprotection diode over the time domain of an ESD pulse in the\nform of an oscilloscope screenshot, which can be found onthe datasheets for all ESD protection diodes.
