The FT232H has one independent UART/FIFO Controller. This \ncontrols the UART data, 245 FIFO data, Fast Serial (opto isolation) or Bit -Bang mode which can be \nselected by SETUP ( FT_SetBitMode ) command.  Each Multi -Purpose UART/FIFO Controller also contains \nan MPSSE ( Multi-Protocol  Synchronous Serial Engine). Using this MPSSE, the Multi -Purpose UART/FIFO \nController can be configured under software command, to have one of the MPSSE ( SPI (MASTER) , I2C, \nand JTAG ). \n \nUSB Protocol Engine and FIFO control. The USB Protocol Engine controls and manages  the interface \nbetween the UTMI PHY and the FIFOs of the chip. It also handles power management and the USB \nprotocol specification.  \n \nPort FIFO TX Buffer (1 Kbytes). Data from the Host PC is stored in these buffers to be used by the  \nMulti-purpose UART/FIFO controllers. This is controlled by the USB Protocol Engine and FIFO control \nblock.  \n \nPort FIFO RX Buffer (1K bytes). Data from the Multi -purpose UART/FIFO con trollers is stored in these  \nblocks to be sent back to the Host PC when requested. This is controlled by the USB Protocol Engine and \nFIFO control block.  \n \nRESET Generator – The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power -on reset to the device \ninternal circuitry at power up. The RESET# input pin allows an external device to reset the FT232H. \nRESET# should be tied to VCCIO  (+3.3V) if not being used.  \n \nBaud Rate Generators – The Baud Rate Generators provides an x16 or an x10 clock input to the \nUART’s from a 120MHz reference clock and consists of a 14 bit pre -scaler and 4 register bits which \nprovide fine tuning of the baud rate (used to divide by a number plus a fraction). This determines the \nBaud Rate of the UART which is  programmable from 183 baud to 12 Mbaud. See FTDI application note \nAN_120 on the FTDI website  for more details.  \n \nEEPROM Interface . If the external EEPROM is fitted, the FT232H can be configured as an asynchronous \nserial UART (default mode), parallel FIFO (245) mode, FT1248, fast serial (opto isolation) or CPU -Style \nFIFO.  The EEPROM should be a 16 bit wide configuration such as a 93LC56B  or equivalent capable of a \n1Mbit/s clock rate at VCCIO = +2.97V to 3.63V. The EE PROM is programmable in -circuit over USB using \na utility program called FT_Prog  available from FTDI web site.  Please note that the 93LC46B  is not \ncompatible with the FT232H device.  \n \n+1.8/3.3V LDO Regulator. The +3.3/+1.8V LDO regulator generates +1.8 volts for the core and the \nUSB transceiver cell and +3.3V for the IO and the internal PLL and USB PHY power supply.  \n \nUTMI PHY . The Universal Transceiver Macrocell Interface (UTMI) physical interface cell. This block \nhandles the Full speed / Hi -Speed SERDES (serialise – deserialise) function for the USB TX/RX data. It \nalso provides the clocks for the rest of the chip. A 12 MHz cr ystal must be connected to the OSCI and \nOSCO pins or 12 MHz Oscillator must be connected to the OSCI, and the OSCO is left unconnected . A 12K \nOhm resistor should be connected between REF and GND on the PCB.  \n \nThe UTMI PHY functions include:  \n \n\uf0b7 Supports 480 Mb it/s “Hi -Speed” (HS)/ 12 Mbit/s “Full Speed” (FS).  \n\uf0b7 SYNC/EOP generation and checking  \n\uf0b7 Data and clock recovery from serial stream on the USB.  \n\uf0b7 Bit-stuffing/unstuffing; bit stuff error detection.  \n\uf0b7 Manages USB Resume, Wake Up and Suspend functions.  \n\uf0b7 Single paralle l data clock output with on -chip PLL to generate higher speed serial data clocks.  \n \n  \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited   20 \nFT232H  SINGLE CHANNEL HI -SPEED USB TO MULTIPURPOSE \nUART/FIFO IC  Datasheet   \nVersion 2.0  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000288  Clearance No.: FTDI #199  \n4.3 FT232 UART Interface Mode Description  \nThe FT232H can be configured as a UART with external line drivers, similar to operation with the FTDI \nFT232R devices.

The \nFT1248 protocol is a dynamic bi -directional data bus interface that can be configured as 1, 2, 4, or 8 -bits \nwide.  \n \n[7:0]SCLK\nMIOSIO\nMISO\nSS#SCLK\nMIOSIO\nMISO\nSS#FPGA (FT1248 Master) FT232H (FT1248 Slave)\n \nFigure 4.7 FT1248  Bus with Single Master and Slave.  \n \nIn the FT1248 there are 3 distinct phases:  \n \nWhile SS _n is inactive, the FT1248 reflects the status of the write buffer and read buffers on the \nMIOSIO[0] and MISO wires respectively. Additionally, the FT1248 slave block s upports multiple slave \ndevices where a master can communicate with multiple FT1248 slave devices. When the slave is sharing \nbuses with other FT1248 slave devices, the write and read buffer status cannot be reflected on the \nMIOSIO[0] and MISO wires during S S_n inactivity as this would cause bus contention. Therefore, it is \npossible for the user to select whether they wish to have the buffer status switched on or off during \ninactivity. When SS _n is active a command/bus size phase occurs first. Following the c ommand phase is \nthe data phase, for each data byte transferred the FT1248 slave drives an ACK/NAK status onto the MISO \nwire. The master can send multiple data bytes so long as SS _n is active, if a unsuccessful data transfer \noccurs, i.e. a NAK happens on th e MISO wire then the master should immediately abort the transfer by \nde-asserting SS _n. \n \nBUS TURNAROUNDWRITE DATA\nTXE# CMDCLK\nSCLK\nSS_n\nMIOSIO[0]\nRXF# MISO RXF#RDATA0 RDATA1 RDATA2 TXE# CMD WDATA 0 WDATA 1 TXE#WRITE READ\nRXF#STATUS STATUS STATUS STATUS STATUS\n \nFigure 4.8 FT1248 Basic Waveform Protocol  \n \nSection 4.6.2 illustrates the FT1248 write and read protocol operating in 1 -bit mode.

For example if both of the MIOSIO [7:3] signals are low then \nthe data transfer width equals 8 -bits or if both of the MIOSIO [3:1] signals are low then the data transfer \nwidth equals 4 -bits. \n \nIn order to successfully decode the bus width, all MIOSIO signals must have pull up resistors. By default, \nall MIOSIO signals shall be seen by the FT232H in FT1248 mode as logic ‘1’. This means that when a \nFT1248 master does not wish to use certain MIOS IO signals the slave (FT232H) is still capable of \ndetermining the requested bus width since any unused MIOSIO signals shall be pull up in the slave.  \n \nThe remaining bits used during the command phase are used to contain the command itself which means \nthat i t is possible to define up to 16 unique commands.  \n \nFigure 4.9 FT1248 Command Structure  \n \nFor more details about FT1248 Interface, please refer to application note AN_167_FT1248 Parallel Serial \nInterface Basics  available at http://www.ftdichip.com . \n  \nCMD[3]BWID 2-bitBWID 4-bitCMD[2]BWID 8-bit CMD[1] CMD[0] XLSB MSB\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n1-bit Bus \nWidthCMD[3] X X CMD[2] X CMD[1] CMD[0] X\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n2-bit Bus \nWidthCMD[3] 0 X CMD[2] X CMD[1] CMD[0] X\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n4-bit Bus \nWidthCMD[3] X 0 CMD[2] X CMD[1] CMD[0] X\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n8-bit Bus \nWidthCMD[3] X X CMD[2] 0 CMD[1] CMD[0] X\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited   28 \nFT232H  SINGLE CHANNEL HI -SPEED USB TO MULTIPURPOSE \nUART/FIFO IC  Datasheet   \nVersion 2.0  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000288  Clearance No.: FTDI #199  \n4.6.2  FT1248: 1 -bit interface  \nThe FT1248 Interface transfer s data over different bus widths (1 -bit, 2 -bit, 4 -bit and 8 -bit).

When the master wishes to initiate a data transfer, SS _n becomes active. As soon as \nSS_n becomes active the SPI slave immediately stops drivin g the MIOSIO[0] signal and SPI master is not \nallowed to begin driving the MIOSIO[0] signal until the first clock edge, this ensures that bus contention \nis avoided.  \n \nOn the first clock edge the command is shifted out for 7 clocks, on the 8th clock cycle a b us turnaround is \nrequired. The bus turnaround is required as the slave may be required to drive the MIOSIO[0] bus with \nread data. The data phase occurs in response to the command and so long as SS _n remains active. The \ndata phase in 1 -bit mode requires 8 c lock cycles where the MIOSIO[0] signal transfers the requested \nwrite or read data. The MISO signal indicates to the master the success of the transfer with an ACK or \nNAK.  \n \nThe status is reflected through the whole of the data phase and is valid from the first clock edge. If the \nmaster is writing data to the slave, then on the last clock edge before it de -asserts SS _n must tristate  \nthe MIOSIO[0] signal to enable the bus to be “turned” around as when SS _n becomes inactive the \nFT1248 slave shall begin to dri ve the write buffer status onto the MIOSIO[0] signal. When the SPI slave \nis driving the MIOSIO[0] (the master is reading data) no bus turnaround is required as when SS _n \nbecomes inactive it is required to drive the write buffer status to the FT1248 master.  \n \n4.7 Synchronous and Asynchronous Bit -Bang Interface Mode  \n \nThe FT232H can be configured as a bit -bang interface. There are two types of bit -bang modes: \nsynchronous and asynchronous.  \n \nSee application note AN2232 -02 Bit Mode Functions for the FT232  for more details and examples of using \nboth Synchronous and Asynchronous bit -bang modes.  \n \n4.7.1  Asynchronous Bit -Bang Mode  \nAsynchronous Bit -Bang mode is the same as BM -style Bit -Bang mode, except that the internal RD# and \nWR# strobes (RDSTB# and WRSTB#) are now brought out of the device to allow external logic to be \nclocked by accesses to the bit -bang IO bus.  \n \nAny data written to the device in the normal manner will be self-clocked  onto the data pins (those which \nhave been configured as outputs). Each pin can be independently set as an input or an output. The rate \nthat the data is clocked out at is controlled by the baud rate generator.  \n \nNew data must be written, and the baud rate c lock should tick to change the data. If no new data is \nwritten to the chip, the pins configured for output will hold the last value written.  \n \nAsynchronous Bit -Bang mode is enabled using the FT_SetBitMode D2xx  driver command with a hex value \nof 0x01.  \n \n4.7.2  Synchronous Bit -Bang Mode  \nThe synchronous Bit -Bang mode will only update the output parallel port pins whenever data is sent from \nthe USB interface to the parallel interface. When this is done, the WRSTB# will activate to indicate that \nthe data has been re ad from the USB Rx FIFO buffer and written out on the pins. Data can only be \nreceived from the parallel pins (to the USB Tx FIFO interface) after the parallel interface has been written \nto. \n \nWith Synchronous Bit -Bang mode data will only be sent out by the FT232H if there is space in the \nFT232H USB TXFIFO for data to be read from the parallel interface pins. This Synchronous Bit -Bang mode \nwill read the data bus parallel I/O pins first, before it transmits data from the USB RxFIFO. It is therefore \n1 byte behi nd the output, and so to read the inputs for the byte that you have just sent, another byte \nmust be sent.  \n \nFor example:  \nFigure 1.  Pins start at 0xFF  \nSend 0x55, 0xAA  \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited   30 \nFT232H  SINGLE CHANNEL HI -SPEED USB TO MULTIPURPOSE \nUART/FIFO IC  Datasheet   \nVersion 2.0  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000288  Clearance No.: FTDI #199  \nPins go to 0x55 and then to 0xAA  \nData read = 0xFF,0x55  \n(2) Pins start at 0xFF  \nSend 0x55, 0xAA, 0xAA  \n(repeat the last byte sent)  \nPins go to 0x55 and then to 0xAA  \nData read = 0xFF, 0x55, 0xAA  \n \nSynchronous Bit -Bang Mode differs from Asynchronous Bit -Bang mode in that the device parallel output \nis only read when the parallel output is written to by the USB interface. This mak es it easier for the \ncontrolling program to measure the response to a USB output stimulus as the data returned to the USB \ninterface is synchronous to the output data.  \n \nSynchronous Bit -Bang mode is enabled using S et Bit Bang Mode driver command with a hex value of \n0x04.  \n \nAn example of the synchronous bit -bang mode timing is shown in Figure 4.12 \nWRSTB#\nRDSTB#\n \nFigure 4.12 Synchronous Bit -Bang Mode Timing Interface Example  \n \nWRSTB# = this output indicates when new data has been written to the I/O pins from the Host PC (via \nthe USB interface).  \n \nName  Description  \nt1 Current pin state is read  \nt2 RDSTB# is set inactive and data on the parallel  I/O pins is read and \nsent to the USB host.  \nT3 RDSTB# is  set active again, and any pins that are output will change \nto their new data  \nt4 1 clock cycle to allow for data setup  \nt5 WRSTB# goes active. This indicates that the host PC has written new \ndata to the I/O parallel data pins  \nt6 WRSTB# goes inactive  \nTable 4.3 Synchronous Bit -Bang Mode Timing Interface Example Timings  \n \nRDSTB# = this output rising edge indicates when data has been read from the I/O pins and sent to the \nHost PC (via the USB interface) . \n \nThe WRSTB# goes active in t5. The WRSTB# goes active when data is read from the USB RXFIFO (i.e. \nsent from the PC). The RDSTB# goes inactive when data is sampled from the pins and written to the USB \nTXFIFO (i.e. sent to the PC). The SETUP command to the FT232H  is used to setup the bit -mode. This \ncommand also contains a byte wide data mask to set the direction of each bit. The direction on each pin \ndoesn’t change unless a new SETUP command is used to modify the direction.  \n \nThe WRSTB# and RDSTB# strobes are only  a guide to what may be happening depending on the \ndirection of the bus. For example if all pins are configured as inputs, it is still necessary to write to these \npins in order to get the FT232H to read those pins even though the data written will never ap pear on the \npins. \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited   31 \nFT232H  SINGLE CHANNEL HI -SPEED USB TO MULTIPURPOSE \nUART/FIFO IC  Datasheet   \nVersion 2.0  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000288  Clearance No.: FTDI #199  \nSignals and data -flow are illustrated in Figure 4.13 \nUSB Rx \nFIFO/\nBuffer\nParallel I/O \ndataParallel \nI/O pins USBWRSTB#\nRDSTB#USB Tx \nFIFO/\nBuffer\n \nFigure 4.13- Bit-bang Mode Dataflow Illustration Diagram  \n \n4.8 MPSSE Interface Mode Description  \n \nMPSSE Mode is designed to allow the FT232H to interface efficiently with synchronous serial protocols \nsuch as JTAG, I2C and SPI (MASTER)  Bus. It can also be used to program SRAM based FPGA’s over USB. \nThe MPSSE interface is designed to be flexible so that it can be configured to allow any synchronous \nserial protocol (industry standard or proprietary) to be implemented using the FT232H.  \n \nMPSSE is fully configurable, and is programmed by sending commands down the data stream.

Fast \nserial mode is enabled by setting the appropria te bits in the external EEPROM . The fast serial mode can \nbe held in reset by setting a bit value of 0x10 using the FT_SetBit Mode  D2XX driver  command. While this \nbit is set the device is held reset – data can be sent to the device, but it will not be sent o ut by the device \nuntil the device is enabled again. This is done by sending a bit value of 0x00 using the Set Bit Mode \ncommand.  \n \nWhen the FT232H is configured in Fast Serial Interface mode the IO timing of the signals used are shown \nin Figure 4.17 and the timings are shown in Table 4.5 Fast Serial Interface Signal Timings . \n \n \nFigure 4.17 Fast Serial Interface Signal Waveforms  \n \nName Minimum Typical Maximu Units Description\nt1 5 ns FSDO/FSCTS hold time\nt2 5 ns FSDO/FSCTS setup time\nt3 5 ns FSDI hold time\nt4 10 ns FSDI Setup Time\nt5 10 ns FSCLK low\nt6 10 ns FSCLK high\nt7 20 ns FSCLK Period\n \nTable 4.5 Fast Serial Interface Signal Timings  \n\n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited   34 \nFT232H  SINGLE CHANNEL HI -SPEED USB TO MULTIPURPOSE \nUART/FIFO IC  Datasheet   \nVersion 2.0  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000288  Clearance No.: FTDI #199  \n4.9.1  Outgoing Fast Serial Data  \nTo send fast serial data out of the FT232H, the external device must drive the FSCLK clock. If the FT232H \nhas data ready to send, it will drive FSDO output low to indicate the start bit. It wi ll not do this if it is \ncurrently receiving data from the external device. This is illustrated in Figure 4.18. \n \n \nFigure 4.18 Fast Serial Interface Output Data  \nNotes : \n \n1. The first bit output (Start bit) is always 0.  \n2. FSDO is always sent LSB first.  \n3. The last serial bit output is the source bit (SRCE) is always 0.  \n4. If the target device is unable to accept the data when it detects the START bit, it should stop the \nFSCLK until it can accept the data.  \n \n4.9.2  Incoming Fast Serial Data  \nAn external device is allowed to send data into the FT232H if FSCTS is high. On receipt of a zero START \nbit on FSDI, the FT232H  will drop FSCTS on the next positive clock edge. The data from bits 0 to 7 are \nthen clocked in (LSB first). The last bit (DEST) determines where the data will be written to.  This bit is \nalways 0 with the FT232H.  This is illustrated in Figure 4.19. \n \n \nFigure 4.19 Fast Serial Interface Input Data  \nNotes:  \n \n1. The first bit input (Start bit) is always 0.  \n2. FSDI is always received LSB first.  \n3. The last received serial bit is the destination bit (DEST) is always 0.  \n4.  The target device should ensure that FSCTS is high before it sends data. FSCTS goes low after \ndata bit 0 (D0) and stays low until the chip can accept more d ata. \nFSCLK\nFSDO 0 D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 SRCE\nStart\nBit Data Bits - LSB firstSource\nBit\nFSCLK\nFSDI 0 D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 DEST\nStart\nBit Data Bits - LSB firstDestination\nBitFSCTS\n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited   35 \nFT232H  SINGLE CHANNEL HI -SPEED USB TO MULTIPURPOSE \nUART/FIFO IC  Datasheet   \nVersion 2.0  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000288  Clearance No.: FTDI #199  \n4.9.3  Fast Serial Data Interface Example  \n \nFigure 4.20 shows example of two Agilent HCPL -2430 (see the semiconductor section at  \nwww.avagotech.com ) Hi-Speed opto -couplers used to optically isolate an extern al device which interfaced \nto USB using the FT232H. In this example VCC5V is the USB VBUS supply and VCCE is the supply to the \nexternal device.  \n \nCare must be taken with the voltage used to power the photo -LED. It must be the same voltage as that \nwhich the FT232H I/ Os are driving to , or the LED’s may be permanently on. Limiting resistors should be \nfitted in the lines that drive the diodes.

When data is being transmitted or \nreceived the respective pins drive from tristate  to low in order  to provide indication on the LED’s of data \ntransfer. A digital one -shot timer is used so that even a small percentage of data transfer is visible to the \nend user.  \n \nFigure 4.23 Dual LED UART Configuration  \n \nFigure 4.23 shows a configuration using two individual LED’s – one for transmitted data the other for \nreceived data.   \n\n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited   38 \nFT232H  SINGLE CHANNEL HI -SPEED USB TO MULTIPURPOSE \nUART/FIFO IC  Datasheet   \nVersion 2.0  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000288  Clearance No.: FTDI #199  \n \nFigure 4.24 Single LED UART Configuration  \n \nIn Figure 4.24 transmit and receive LED indicators are wire -OR’ed together to give a s ingle LED indicator \nwhich indicates any transmit or receive data activit y.  \n \nNote that the LED’s are connected to the same supply as VCCIO.  \n \n4.12  Send Immediate/Wake Up (SIWU#)  \n \nThe SIWU# pin is available in the FIFO modes and in bit bang mode.  \n \nThe Send Immediate portion is used to flush data from the chip back to the PC. This can be used to force \nshort packets of data back to the PC without waiting for the latency timer to expire.  \n \nTo avoid overrunning, this mechanism should only be used when a process o f sending data to the chip \nhas been stopped.  \n \nThe data transfer is flagged to the USB host by the falling edge of the SIWU# signal.  The USB host will \nschedule the data transfer on the next USB packet.  \n \nCLKOUT\nWR#\nSIWU#D7-D0\n \n \nFigure 4. 25 Using SIWU#  \n \nWhen the pin is being used for a Wake Up function to wake up a sleeping PC a 20ms negative pulse on \nthis pin is required.

When using remote wake -up, ensure the resistors are pulled -up in suspend. Also ensure peripheral \ndesigns do not allow any current sink paths that may partially power the peripheral.  \n2. If remote wake -up is enabled, a periph eral is allowed to draw up to 2.5mA in suspend. If remote \nwake-up is disabled, the peripheral must draw no more than 500uA in suspend.  \n3. If a Pull -down is enabled, the FT232H will not wake up from suspend when using SIWU # \n4. In UART mode the RI# pin acts as the wake up pin.  \n \n4.13  FT232H Mode Selection  \n \nThe FT232H defaults to asynchronous serial interface (UART)  mode of operation .  \n \nAfter a reset the required mode is determined by the contents of the external EEPROM which can be \nprogr ammed using FT_Prog .  \n \nThe EEPROM contents determine if the FT232H device is configured as FT232 asynchronous serial \ninterface, FT245 FIFO interface, CPU -style FIFO interface, FT1248 or Fast Serial Interface.  \n \nFollowing a reset, the EEPROM is read and the FT232H configured for the selected mode. After device \nenumeration, the FT_SetBitMode  command (refer to D2XX_Programmers_Guide ) can be sent to the \nUSB driver to switch the sele cted interface into other modes – asynchronous bit -bang, synchronous bit -\nbang or MPSSE – if required.  \n \nWhen in FT245 FIFO mode, the FT_SetBitMode  command can be used to select Synchronous FIFO \n(FT_SetBitMode  = 0x40).  Note that FT 245 FIFO mode must be confi gured in the EEPROM before \nselecting the Synchronous FIFO mode.  \n \nThe drive strength selection, slew rate and Schmitt input function can also be configured in the EEPROM . \n \nThe MPSSE can be configured directly using the D2XX commands. The D2XX_Programmers_Guide  is \navailable from the FTDI website . The application note  AN_108 – Command Processor for MPSSE and MCU \nHost Bus Emulation Modes  gives further explanation and examples for the MPSSE.  \n \n4.14  Modes Configuration  \n \nThis section summarises what modes are configurable using the external EEPROM or the application \nsoftware.  \n \n ASYNC \nSerial \nUART  STYLE \nASYNC           \n245      \nFIFO  SYNC  \n245 \nPARALLEL \nFIFO  FT1248  ASYNC \nBit-\nBang  SYNC \nBit-\nBang  MPSSE  Fast \nSerial \nInterface  CPU-\nStyle \nFIFO  \nEEPROM \nconfigured  YES YES YES YES NO NO NO YES YES \nApplication \nSoftware \nconfigured  NO NO YES NO YES YES YES RESET  NO \nTable 4.9 Configuration Using EEPROM and Application Software  \nNote:  \n \n1.

It is recommended to \nuse a fundamental mode, parallel cut type crystal.  \n \nIt is also possible to use a 12 MHz Oscillator with the FT232H. In this case the output of the oscillator \nwould drive OSCI, and OSCO should be left unconnected. The oscillator must have a CMOS output drive \ncapability.  \n \nParameter  Description  Minimum  Typic al Maximum  Units  Conditions  \nOSCI Vin  Input Voltage  2.97 3.3V 3.63 V  \nFin Input Frequency   12MHz   MHz ± 30ppm  \nJi Cycle to cycle jitter   <150   pS  \nTable 6.1 OSCI Input characteristics  \n \n\n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited   47 \nFT232H  SINGLE CHANNEL HI -SPEED USB TO MULTIPURPOSE \nUART/FIFO IC  Datasheet   \nVersion 2.0  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000288  Clearance No.: FTDI #199  \n7 EEPROM Configuration  \n7.1 EEPROM Interface  \nThe FT232H uses configuration data from an external EEPROM. The EEPROM must be 16 bits wide \n(93LC56B) and powered from the same net as the core supply of +2.97 to +3.63 volts.   Adding an \nexternal (93LC56B) EEPROM allows the chip  to be con figured as a serial UART (RS232 mode), parallel \nFIFO (245) mode, FT1248, fast serial (opto isolation) or CPU -Style FIFO.  \n \n \nFigure 7.1 EEPROM Interface  \n \nThe external EEPROM can also be used to customise the USB VID, PID, Serial Number, Product \nDescription Strings and Power Descriptor value of the FT232H for OEM applications. Other parameters \ncontrolled by the EEPROM include Remote Wake Up, Soft Pull Down o n Power -Off and I/O pin drive \nstrength.  \n \nIf the FT232H is used without an external EEPROM the chip defaults to a USB to asynchronous serial \nUART (RS232 mode) port device. If no EEPROM is connected (or the EEPROM is blank), the FT232H uses \nits built -in def ault VID (0403), PID (6014) Product Description and Power Descriptor Value. In this case, \nthe device will not have a serial number as part of the USB descriptor.  \n \n7.2 Default EEPROM Configuration  \nThe external EEPROM (if it’s fitted) can be programmed over USB using FT_Prog . This allows a blank part \nto be soldered onto the PCB and programmed as part of the manufacturing and test process.  Users who \ndo not have their  own USB Vendor ID but who would like to use a unique Product ID in their design can \napply to FTDI for a free block of unique PIDs.  \n \n Contact FTDI support for this service.   \n \nParameter  Value  Notes  \nUSB Vendor ID (VID)  0403h  FTDI default VID (hex)  \nUSB Product UD (PID)  6014h  FTDI default PID (hex)  \nbcd Device  009h  \nSerial Number \nEnabled?
