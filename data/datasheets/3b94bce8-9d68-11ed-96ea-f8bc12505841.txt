Each switch is disabled\nwhen the associated output-enable (OE ) input is high.\nThis device is fully specified for partial-power-down applications using I off. The Ioff feature ensures that\ndamaging current will not backflow through the device when it is powered down. The device has isolation during\npower off.\nTo ensure the high-impedance state during power up or power down, OE  should be tied to V CC through a pullup\nresistor; the minimum value of the resistor is determined by the current-sinking capability of the driver.\nORDERING INFORMATION\nTA PACKAGE †ORDERABLE\nPART NUMBERTOP-SIDE\nMARKING\nQFN − RGY Tape and reel SN74CBTLV3125RGYR CL125\nSOIC − DTube

#### Description:
The **SN74CBTLV3125** is a **quad FET bus switch** designed for high-speed data switching applications. Each switch is independently controlled by an output-enable (OE) input, allowing for flexible data routing. The device is optimized for low power consumption and features rail-to-rail switching capabilities, making it suitable for various digital signal applications.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Data Routing:** The SN74CBTLV3125 is commonly used in applications where multiple data paths need to be switched, such as in communication systems and data multiplexing.
- **Signal Isolation:** It can isolate signals during power-down conditions, preventing backflow of current and protecting sensitive components.
- **Bus Switching:** Ideal for bus systems where multiple devices share a common data line, allowing for efficient data management and reduced power consumption.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Used in devices like smartphones, tablets, and other portable electronics where space and power efficiency are critical.

This component is particularly useful in applications requiring low on-resistance and fast switching times, making it a versatile choice for modern electronic designs.
