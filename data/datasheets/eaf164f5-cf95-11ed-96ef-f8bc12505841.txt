Output\ncurrents can go as high as 2 A while using a dual-cell\nLi-Ion or Li-polymer battery, and discharge to 5 V or\nlower. The buck-boost converter is based on a fixed\nfrequency, pulse width modulation (PWM) controller\nusing synchronous rectification to obtain maximum\nefficiency. At low load currents, the converter enters\npower save mode to maintain high efficiency over a\nwide load current range. The power save mode can\nbe disabled, forcing the converter to operate at a fixed\nswitching frequency. The maximum average current in\nthe switches is limited to a typical value of 2.25 A. The\noutput voltage is programmable using an external\nresistor divider, or is fixed internally on the chip.

This enables the device to keep high efficiency over the complete input voltage and output\npower range. To regulate the output voltage at all possible input voltage conditions, the device automatically\nswitches from buck operation to boost operation and back as required by the configuration. It always uses one\nactive switch, one rectifying switch, one switch is held on, and one switch held off. Therefore, it operates as a\nbuck converter when the input voltage is higher than the output voltage, and as a boost converter when the input\nvoltage is lower than the output voltage. There is no mode of operation in which all 4 switches are switching at\nthe same time. Keeping one switch on and one switch off eliminates their switching losses. The RMS current\nthrough the switches and the inductor is kept at a minimum, to minimize switching and conduction losses.\nControlling the switches this way allows the converter to always keep higher efficiency.\nThe device provides a seamless transition from buck to boost or from boost to buck operation.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagrams\n_\n+PGND PGND VIN\nVAUX\n+\n-VREF\nPGNDPGNDFBVOUTL2 L1\nVIN\nVAUX\nPS/SYNC\nEN\nGNDVAUXCurrent\nSensor\nGate\nControl\nModulator\nOscillator\nDevice\nControlPG\nTemperature\nControl_+Bias\nRegulatorVIN VOUT\nVOUT\nFigure 8-1.

TPS63061 Fixed Output\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Power Good\nThe device has a built in power good function to indicate whether the output voltage is regulated properly. As\nsoon as the average inductor current gets limited to a value below the current the voltage regulator demands for\nmaintaining the output voltage the power good output gets low impedance. The output is open drain, so its logic\nfunction can be adjusted to any voltage level the connected logic is using, by connecting a pull up resistor to the\nsupply voltage of the logic. By monitoring the status of the current control loop, the power good output provides\nthe earliest indication possible for an output voltage break down and leaves the connected application a\nmaximum time to safely react.\n8.3.2 Soft-Start Function\nAfter being enabled, the device starts operating. The average current limit ramps up from an initial 400 mA\nfollowing the output voltage increasing. At an output voltage of about 1.2 V, the current limit is at its nominal\nvalue. If the output voltage does not increase, the current limit does not increase. The device implements no\ntimer. Thus, the output voltage overshoot at startup, as well as the inrush current, remains at a minimum. The\ndevice ramps up the output voltage in a controlled manner even if a large capacitor is connected at the output.\n8.3.3 Short-Circuit Protection\nWhen the output voltage does not increase above 1.2 V, the device assumes a short circuit at the output, and\nkeeps the current limit low to protect itself and the application. During a short-circuit situation on the output, the\ndevice maintains the current limit below 2 A typically (minimum average inductance current).\n8.3.4 Overvoltage Protection\nIf, for any reason, the output voltage is not fed back properly to the input of the voltage amplifier, control of the\noutput voltage no longer works. Therefore, overvoltage protection is implemented to avoid the output voltage\nexceeding critical values for the device and possibly for the system it supplies. The implemented overvoltage\nprotection circuit monitors the output voltage internally as well. If it reaches the overvoltage threshold, the\nvoltage amplifier regulates the output voltage to this value.www.ti.comTPS63060, TPS63061\nSLVSA92C – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS63060  TPS63061\n8.3.5 Undervoltage Lockout\nAn undervoltage lockout function prevents device start-up if the supply voltage on VIN is lower than\napproximately its threshold (see the Section 7.5 table). When in operation, the device automatically enters the\nshutdown mode if the voltage on VIN drops below the undervoltage lockout threshold. The device automatically\nrestarts if the input voltage recovers to the minimum operating input voltage.\n8.3.6 Overtemperature Protection\nThe device has a built-in temperature sensor which monitors the internal device temperature. If the temperature\nexceeds the programmed threshold (see the Section 7.5 table) the device stops operating. As soon as the\ndevice temperature has decreased below the programmed threshold, it starts operating again. There is a built-in\nhysteresis to avoid unstable operation at device temperatures at the overtemperature threshold.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Buck-Boost Operation\nTo regulate the output voltage at all possible input voltage conditions, the device automatically switches from\nbuck operation to boost operation and back as required. It always uses one active switch, one rectifying switch,\none switch permanently on, and one switch permanently off. Therefore, it operates as a step down converter\n(buck) when the input voltage is higher than the output voltage, and as a boost converter when the input voltage\nis lower than the output voltage. There is no mode of operation in which all 4 switches are permanently\nswitching. Controlling the switches this way allows the converter to maintain high efficiency at the most important\npoint of operation, when the input voltage is close to the output voltage. The RMS current through the switches\nand the inductor is kept at a minimum, to minimize switching and conduction losses.\n8.4.2 Control Loop\nThe controller circuit of the device is based on an average current mode topology. The average inductor current\nis regulated by a fast current regulator loop which is controlled by a voltage control loop. Figure 8-3  shows the\ncontrol loop.\nBuck\nDriveBoost\nDrive\nVref\n0.

The output of g MV\ndefines the average inductor current. The inductor current is reconstructed by measuring the current through the\nhigh side buck MOSFET. This current corresponds exactly to the inductor current in boost mode. In buck mode\nthe current is measured during the on time of the same MOSFET. During the off time, the current is\nreconstructed internally starting from the peak value at the end of the on-time cycle. The average current is\ncompared to the desired value and the difference, or current error, is amplified and compared to the buck or the\nboost sawtooth ramp. Depending on which of the two ramps the g MC amplified output crosses, the device\nacitvates either the buck MOSFETs or the boost MOSFETs. When the input voltage is close to the output\nvoltage, one boost cycle always follows a buck cycle. In this condition, no more than three cycles in a row of the\nsame mode are allowed. This control method in the buck-boost region ensures a robust control and the highest\nefficiency.\n8.4.3 Power-Save Mode\nThe PS/SYNC pin can be used to select different operation modes. Power save mode improves efficiency at\nlight load. To enable power save mode, PS/SYNC must be set low. The device enters power save mode when\nthe average inductor current falls to a level lower than approximately 100 mA. In that situation, the converter\noperates with reduced switching frequency and with a minimum quiescent current to maintain high efficiency.\nDuring the power save mode operation, the output voltage is monitored with a comparator by the threshold\ncomparator low and comparator high. When the device enters power save mode, the converter stops operating\nand the output voltage drops. The slope of the output voltage depends on the load and the value of output\ncapacitance. As the output voltage falls below the comparator low threshold set to 2.5% typical above the output\nvoltage, the device ramps up the output voltage again, by starting operation using a programmed average\ninductor current higher than required by the current load condition. Operation can last for one or several pulses.\nThe converter continues these pulses until the comparator high threshold, set to typically 3.5% above the\nnominal output voltage, is reached and the average inductor current gets lower than about 100 mA. When the\nload increases above the minimum forced inductor current of about 100 mA, the device automatically switches to\nPWM mode.\nThe power save mode can be disabled by programming the PS/SYNC high.\n3.5 %\n3 %\n2.5 %\n PFM Mode\n at Light Load Current .VOUTHeavy Load Transient Step\nComp High\nComp Low\n  PWM Mode  .Absolute voltage drop\n with positioning\nFigure 8-4. Power-Save Mode Thresholds and Dynamic Voltage Positioning\n8.4.4 Synchronization\nConnecting a clock signal at PS/SYNC forces the device to synchronize to the connected clock frequency.\nSynchronization is done by a PLL to lower and higher frequencies compared to the internal clock. The PLL can\nalso tolerate missing clock pulses without the converter malfunctioning. The PS/SYNC input supports standard\nlogic thresholds.\n8.4.5 Dynamic Voltage Positioning\nThe output voltage is typically 3% above the nominal output voltage at light-load currents, as the device is\noperating in power save mode. This operation mode allows additional headroom for the voltage drop during a\nload transient from light load to full load. This additional headroom allows the converter to operate with a smallwww.ti.comTPS63060, TPS63061\nSLVSA92C – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS63060  TPS63061\noutput capacitor and maintain a low absolute voltage drop during heavy load transient changes. See Figure 8-4\nfor detailed operation of the power save mode operation.\n8.4.6 Dynamic Current Limit\nThe dynamic current limit function maintains the output voltage regulation when the power source becomes\nweaker. The maximum current allowed through the switch depends on the voltage applied at the input terminal\nof the TPS6306x  devices. Figure 8-5  shows this dependency, and the I SW vs V IN. The dynamic current limit has\nits lowest value when reaching the minimum recommended supply voltage at V IN.\nGiven the I SW value from Figure 8-5 , is then possible to calculate the output current reached in boost mode using\nEquation 1  and Equation 2  and in buck mode using Equation 3  and Equation 4 .\nV - VIN OUTDuty Cycle Boost D =VOUT\n(1)\nMaximum Output Current Boost I = x I x (1 - D)OUT SW/c104\n(2)\nVOUTDuty Cycle Buck D =VIN\n(3)\nMaximum Output Current Buck I = IOUT SW\n(4)\nwhere\n• η is the estimated converter efficiency (use the number from the efficiency curves or 0.80 as an assumption)\n• f is the converter switching frequency (typical 2.4 MHz)\n• L is the selected inductor value\nIf the die temperature increases above the recommended maximum temperature, the dynamic current limit\nbecomes active.

The device enters a shutdown sequence when EN is set to GND.\nDuring the shutdown sequence, the regulator stops switching, all internal control circuitry is switched off, and the\nload is disconnected from the input. It is possible for the output voltage to drop below the input voltage during\nshutdown. During the start-up sequence, the device limits the duty cycle and the peak current in order to avoid\nhigh peak currents flowing from the input.TPS63060, TPS63061\nSLVSA92C – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS63060  TPS63061\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI\ndoes not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

See Table 9-3  for typical inductors.\nTable 9-3.

Especially at\nhigh-switching frequencies the core material has a higher impact on efficiency. When using small chip inductors,\nthe efficiency is reduced mainly due to higher inductor core losses. This needs to be considered when selecting\nthe appropriate inductor. The inductor value determines the inductor ripple current. The larger the inductor value,\nthe smaller the inductor ripple current and the lower the conduction losses of the converter. Conversely, larger\ninductor values cause a slower load transient response. To avoid saturation of the inductor, with the chosen\ninductance value, the peak current for the inductor in steady state operation can be calculated. Equation 1  and\nEquation 5  show how to calculate the peak current I PEAK. Only the equation which defines the switch current in\nboost mode is reported because this is providing the highest value of current and represents the critical current\nvalue for selecting the right inductor.\n/c40 /c41/c180/c61 /c43/c104/c180 /c45 /c180 /c180OUT IN\nPEAK\nSWI V DI1 D 2 f L\n(5)\nwhere\n• D is the duty cycle during boost mode operation\n• f SW is the converter switching frequency (typical 2.4 MHz)\n• L is the selected inductor value\n• η is the estimated converter efficiency (use the number from the efficiency curves or 0.80 as an assumption)\n• The calculation must be done for the minimum input voltage which is possible to have in boost mode\nCalculating the maximum inductor current using the actual operating conditions gives the minimum saturation\ncurrent of the inductor needed. It\'s recommended to choose an inductor with a saturation current 20% higher\nthan the value calculated using Equation 5 . Possible inductors are listed in Table 9-3 .TPS63060, TPS63061\nSLVSA92C – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS63060  TPS63061\n9.2.2.3 Step Three: Capacitor Selection\n9.2.2.3.1 Input Capacitors\nTo improve transient behavior of the regulator and EMI behavior of the total power supply circuit, this design\nsuggests a minimum input capacitance of 20 μF. Place a ceramic capacitor placed as close as possible to the\nVIN and PGND pins of the device.\n9.2.2.3.2 Output Capacitor\nFor the output capacitor, use of a small ceramic capacitor placed as close as possible to the VOUT and PGND\npins of the device is recommended. If, for any reason, the application requires the use of large capacitors which\ncan not be placed close to the device, use a smaller ceramic capacitor in parallel to the large capacitor. The\nsmall capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the VOUT and PGND pins of the device. The\nrecommended typical output capacitor value is 66 µF with a variance as outlined in Table 9-1 .\nThere is also no upper limit for the output capacitance value. Larger capacitors cause lower output voltage ripple\nas well as lower output voltage drop during load transients.\nWhen choosing input and output capacitors, it needs to be kept in mind, that the value of capacitance\nexperiences significant losses from their rated value depending on the operating temperature and the operating\nDC voltage. It is not uncommon for a small surface mount ceramic capacitor to lose 50% and more of its rated\ncapacitance. For this reason, it is important to use a larger value of capacitance or a capacitor with higher\nvoltage rating in order to ensure the required capacitance at the full operating voltage.\n9.2.2.3.3 Bypass Capacitor\nTo make sure that the internal control circuits are supplied with a stable low noise supply voltage, a capacitor is\nconnected between VAUX and GND. Using a ceramic capacitor with a value of 0.1 μF is recommended. The\ncapacitor needs to be placed close to the VAUX pin. The value of this capacitor should not be higher than\n0.22μF.\n9.2.2.4 Step Four: Setting the Output Voltage\nWhen the adjustable output voltage version TPS63060 is used, the output voltage is set by the external resistor\ndivider. The resistor divider must be connected between VOUT, FB and GND. When the output voltage is\nregulated properly, the typical value of the voltage at the FB pin is 500mV. The maximum recommended value\nfor the output voltage is 8V. The current through the resistive divider should be about 100 times greater than the\ncurrent into the FB pin. The typical current into the FB pin is 0.01 μA, and the voltage across the resistor\nbetween FB and GND, R 2, is typically 500 mV. Based on these two values, the recommended value for R2\nshould be lower than 500 k Ω, in order to set the divider current at 3 μA or higher. It is recommended to keep the\nvalue for this resistor in the range of 200 k Ω. From that, the value of the resistor connected between the VOUT\npin and the FB pin, (R1) depending on the needed output voltage can be calculated using Equation 6 .\nOUT\nFBVR1 = R2 × - 1V/c230 /c246\n/c231 /c247\n/c232 /c248\n(6)\nPlace a small capacitor (C4, 10 pF) in parallel with R2 when using the power save mode and the adjustable\nversion, to provide filtering and improve the efficiency at light load.www.ti.comTPS63060, TPS63061\nSLVSA92C – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS63060  TPS63061\n9.2.3 Application Curves\n0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 0.0001\nOutput Current (A)02030507080100Efficiency (%)\n10406090\nVIN = 4.8 V\nVOUT = 8 V VIN = 7.2 V\nVOUT = 2.5 V\nVIN = 7.2 V\nVOUT = 2.5 VVIN = 7.2 V\nVOUT = 8 V\nTPS63060 Power Save Enabled\nFigure 9-2.

If the layout is not carefully done, the regulator could show stability problems as\nwell as EMI problems. Therefore, use wide and short traces for the main current path and for the power ground\ntracks. The input capacitor, output capacitor, and the inductor should be placed as close as possible to the\ndevice. Use a common ground node for power ground and a different one for control ground to minimize the\neffects of ground noise. Connect these ground nodes at any place close to one of the ground pins of the device.\nThe feedback divider should be placed as close as possible to the control ground pin of the device. To lay out\nthe control ground, short traces are recommended as well, separation from the power ground traces. This avoids\nground shift problems, which can occur due to superimposition of power ground current and control ground\ncurrent.\n11.2 Layout Example\nCINCIN\nCOUTCOUTL\nCOUTGND\nGNDGND\nVINVINR1\nC1\nC2 R2C3\nEN\nPS/SYNCPG\nFigure 11-1.
