All connectors provide a snap-in \naction when mated to Versatile Link components. \nSimplex connec  tors are color coded to facilitate identi -\nfication of trans mit ter and receiver connections. Duplex \nconnectors are keyed so that proper orientation is \nensured during insertion. If the POF cable/connector will \nbe used at extreme operating temperatures or experi -\nence frequent and wide temperature cycling effects, the \ncable/connector attachment can be strengthened with \nan RTV adhesive (see Plastic Connector  ing Instructions \nfor more detail). The connectors are made of a flame re -\ntardant VALOX UL94 V-0 material (UL file # E121562).\nSIMPLEX CONNECTOR STYLES\nHFBR-4501Z/4511Z – SimplexDUPLEX CONNECTOR STYLES\nHFBR-4506Z – Duplex\nThe simplex connector provides a quick and stable con -\nnection for applications that require a component-to-\nconnector retention force of 8 Newtons (1.8 lb.). These \nconnectors are available in gray (HFBR-4501Z) or blue \n(HFBR-4511Z). The simplex connector is compatible with \nhorizontal or vertical or tilted packages.\nHFBR-4503Z/4513Z – Simplex Latching\nThe simplex latching connector is designed for rugged \napplications requiring a greater retention force — 80 \nNewtons ( 18 lb.) — than provided by a simplex non -\nlatching connector. When inserting the simplex latching \nconnector into a module, the connector latch mecha -\nnism should be aligned with the top surface of the \nhorizontal package, or with the tall vertical side of the \nvertical package or with top surface of tilted package. \nMisalignment of an inserted latching connector into \neither module will not result in a positive latch. The con -\nnector is released by depressing the rear section of the \nconnector lever, and then pulling the connector assem -\nbly away from the module housing.\nThe simplex latching connector is available in gray (HF -\nBR-4503Z) or blue (HFBR-4513Z).Duplex connectors provide con  venient duplex cable \ntermination and are keyed to prevent incorrect insertion \ninto duplex configured modules. The duplex connector \nis compatible with dual combina  tions of horizontal, ver -\ntical or tilted packages (e.g., two horizontal transmitters, \ntwo vertical receivers, a horizontal transmitter with a \nhorizontal receiver, etc.). The duplex non-latching con -\nnector is available in parchment, off-white (HFBR-4506Z).\nHFBR-4516Z – Duplex Latching\nThe duplex latching connector is designed for rugged \napplications requiring greater retention force than \nthe nonlatching duplex con nector. When inserting the \nduplex latching connector into a module, the connector \nlatch mechanism should be aligned with the top surface \nof the dual combination of horizontal, vertical or tilted \npackages. The duplex latching connector is available in \ngray (HFBR-4516Z).\nFeedthrough/Splice\nHFBR-4505Z/4515Z Bulkhead Adapter\nThe HFBR-4505Z/4515Z adapter mates two simplex \nconnectors for panel/bulkhead feedthrough of HFBR-\n4501Z/4511Z terminated plastic fiber cable. Maximum \npanel thickness is 4.1 mm (0.16 inch). This adapter can \nserve as a cable in-line splice using two simplex connec -\ntors. The adapters are available in gray (HFBR-4505Z) and \nblue (HFBR-4515Z).

It is ideal for both field and \nfactory installation. Connectors can be easily installed \non cable ends with wire strippers, cutters and a crimping \ntool.\nFinishing the cable is accom plished with the Broadcom  \nAFBR-4594Z Polishing Kit, consist ing of a Polishing Fixture, \n600 grit abrasive paper and 3 µm pink lapping film (3M \nCompany, OC3-14). The connector can be used immedi -\nately after polishing.\nMaterials needed for plastic fiber termination are:\n1.  Broadcom Plastic Optical Fiber Cable (Example: HFBR-\nRUS500Z, HFBR-RUD500Z, HFBR-EUS500Z, or HFBR-\nEUD500Z)\n2.  Industrial Razor Blade or Wire Cutters\n3.  16 Gauge Latching Wire Strippers (Example: Ideal \nStripmasterTM type 45-092).\n4.  HFBR-4597Z Crimping Tool\n5.  AFBR-4594Z Polishing Kit\n6.  One of the following connectors:\n a) HFBR-4501Z/4503Z Gray Simplex/Simplex Latching \nConnector and HFBR-4525Z Simplex Crimp Ring\n b) HFBR-4511Z/4513Z Blue Simplex/Simplex Latching \nConnector and HFBR-4525Z Simplex Crimp Ring\n c) HFBR-4506Z Parchment (off-white) Duplex Connector \nand HFBR-4526Z Duplex Crimp Ring\n d) HFBR-4516Z Gray Latching Duplex Connector and \nHFBR-4526Z Duplex Crimp Ring\nStep 1\nThe zip cord structure of the duplex cable permits easy \nseparation of the channels. The channels should be sepa -\nrated a minimum of 100 mm (4 in) to a maximum of 150 \nmm (6 in) back from the ends to permit connectoring \nand polishing.\nAfter cutting the cable to the desired length, strip off  \napproxi mately 7 mm (0.3 in.) of the outer jacket with the \n16 gauge wire strippers. Excess webbing on the duplex \ncable may have to be trimmed to allow the simplex or \nsimplex latching connector to slide over the cable.\nWhen using the duplex connector and duplex cable, the \nseparated duplex cable must be stripped to equal lengths \non each cable. This allows easy and proper seating of the \ncable into the duplex connector.Step 2\nPlace the crimp ring and connec  tor over the end of the \ncable; the fiber should protrude about 3 mm (0.12 in.) \nthrough the end of the connector. Carefully position the \nring so that it is entirely on the connector with the rim of \nthe crimp ring flush with the connec  tor, leaving a small \nspace between the crimp ring and the flange. Then crimp \nthe ring in place with the crimping tool. One crimp tool is \nused for all POF connector crimping requirements.\nFor applications with extreme temperature operation \nor frequent temperature cycling, improved connector \nto cable attachment can be achieved with the use of an \nRTV (GE Company, RTV-128 or Dow Corning 3145-RTV) \nadhesive. The RTV is placed into the connector prior to \ninsertion of the fiber and the fiber is crimped normally. \nThe connector can be polished after the RTV has cured \nand is then ready for use.\nNote: By convention, place the gray connector on the trans\xad\nmitter cable end and the blue connector on the receiver cable \nend to maintain color coding (different color connectors are \nmechanically identical).\nSimplex connector crimp rings cannot be used with duplex \ncon nectors and duplex connec  tor crimp rings cannot be \nused with simplex connectors because of size differences. \nThe simplex crimp has a dull luster appear  ance; the duplex \nring is glossy and has a thinner wall.\n6\nStep 3\nAny excess fiber protruding from the connector end may \nbe cut off; however, the trimmed fiber should extend at \nleast 1.5 mm (0.06 in) from the connector end.\nInsert the connector fully into the polishing fixture with \nthe trimmed fiber protruding from the bottom of the \nfixture. This plastic polish ing fixture can be used to polish \ntwo simplex connectors or sim plex latching connectors \nsimultane ously, or one duplex connector.\nNote: The four dots on the bottom of the polishing fixture \nare wear indicators. Replace the polishing fixture when any \ndot is no longer visible. Typically, the polishing fixture can \nbe used 10 times; 10 duplex connectors or 20 simplex con \xad\nnectors, two at a time.\nPlace the 600 grit abrasive paper on a flat smooth surface, \npressing down on the connector, polish the fiber and the \nconnector using a figure eight pattern of strokes until \nthe connector is flush with the bottom of the polishing \nfixture. Wipe the connector and fixture with a clean cloth \nor tissue.\nStep 4\nPlace the flush connector and polishing fixture on the dull \nside of the 3 µm pink lapping film and continue to polish \nthe fiber and connector for approximately 25 strokes. The \nfiber end should be flat, smooth and clean.\nThis cable is now ready for use.\nNote: Use of the pink lapping film fine polishing step results in \napproximately 2 dB improve ment in coupling performance \nof either a transmitter \xadreceiver link or a bulkhead/splice over \na 600 grit polish alone. This fine polish is comparable to the \nBroadcom factory polish. The fine polishing step may be \nomitted where an extra 2 dB of optical power is not essential, \nas with short link lengths. Proper polishing of the tip of the \nfiber/connector face results in a tip diameter between 2.5 \nmm (0.098 in.) minimum and 3.2 mm (0.126 in.) maximum..\nAFBR-4594Z Polishing Kit\n\n7\nOrdering Guide for POF Cable \nFor Example:\nHFBR-RUD500Z is a Standard Attenuation, Unconnectored, \nDuplex, 500 meter cable.\nHFBR-RLS001Z is a Standard Attenuation, Latching Simplex \nConnectored, Simplex, 1 meter cable.\nHFBR-RMD010Z is a Standard Attenuation, Standard Du -\nplex Connectored, Duplex, 10 meter cable.\nHFBR-RMD100Z is a Standard Attenuation, Standard Du -\nplex Connectored, Duplex, 100 meter cable.Ordering Guide for POF Connectors and Accessories\nPlastic Optical Fiber Connectors\nHFBR-4501Z Gray Simplex Connector/Crimp Ring\nHFBR-4511Z Blue Simplex Connector/Crimp Ring\nHFBR-4503Z Gray Simplex Latching Connector with Crimp Ring\nHFBR-4513Z Blue Simplex Latching Connector with Crimp Ring\nHFBR-4506Z Parchment Duplex Connector with Crimp Ring\nHFBR-4516Z Gray Duplex Latching Connector with Crimp Ring\nHFBR-4505Z Gray Adapter (Bulkhead/Feedthrough)\nHFBR-4515Z Blue Adapter (Bulkhead/Feedthrough)\nPlastic Optical Fiber Accessories\nHFBR-4522Z 500 HFBR-0500 Products Port Plugs\nHFBR-4525Z 1000 Simplex Crimp Rings\nHFBR-4526Z 500 Duplex Crimp Rings\nAFBR-4594Z Polishing Kit (one polishing tool, two pieces 600 grit  \n abrasive paper, and two pieces 3 µm pink lapping film) \nHFBR-4597Z Plastic Fiber Crimping Tool\nCable Length Tolerances:\nThe plastic cable length tolerances are: +10%/-0%.\nNOTE: By convention, pre-connectored simplex POF ca -\nbles have gray and blue colored connectors on the op -\nposite ends of the same fiber; although oppositely col -\nored, the connectors are mechanically identical.
