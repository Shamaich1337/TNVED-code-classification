Intelligent voltage Divider  \ntechnology ( iDivider®  technology) is a new generation digital isolator \ntechnology invented by 2PaiSEMI. It uses the principle of capaci tor \nvoltage divider to transmit signal directly cross the isolator capacitor \nwithout signal modulation and demodulation. Compare to the \ntraditional Opto -couple technology, icoupler technology, OOK \ntechnology, iDivider®  is a more essential and concise isola tion signal \ntransmit technology which leads to greatly simplification on circuit \ndesign and therefore significantly improves device performance, \nsuch as lower power consumption, faster speed, enhanced anti -\ninterference ability, lower noise.   \nBy using matur ated standard semiconductor CMOS technology and \nthe innovative  iDivider®  design, these isolation components provide \noutstanding performance characteristics and reliability superior to \nalternatives such as optocoupler devices and other integrated \nisolators.  The π1xxxxx isolator data channels are independent and \nare available in a variety of configurations with a withstand voltage \nrating of 1.5 kV rms to 5.0 kV rms and the data rate from DC up to \n600Mbps (see the Ordering Guide).  \nThe π110M 3x are the outsta nding 10 Mbps single -channel digital \nisolators with  the enhanced E SD capability . the devices transmit data \nacross an isolation barrier by layers of silicon dioxide isolation.  \nThe devices operate with the supply voltage on either side ranging \nfrom 3.0 V to 5.5 V, offering voltage translation of 3.3 V, and 5 V logic.  \nThe π110M 3x have very low propagation delay and high speed. The \ninput/output design techniques allow logic and supply voltages over \na wide range from 3.0 V to 5.5 V, offerin g voltage  translation of 3.3 \nV,and 5 V logic. The architecture is designed for high common -mode \ntransient immunity and high immunity to electrical noise and \nmagnetic interference . \nSee the Ordering Guide for the model numbers that have the fail -\nsafe output state of low or high.  \nPCB LAYOUT  \nThe low -ESR ceramic bypass capacitors must be connected between \nVDD1 and GND 1 and between V DD2 and GND 2. The bypass capacitors \nare placed on  the PCB as close to the isolator device as possible. The \nrecommended bypass capacitor value is between 0.1 μF and 1 0 μF. \nTo enhance the robustness of a design,  the user may also include \nresistors (50 –300 Ω) in series with the inputs and outputs if the \nsystem is ex cessively noisy.  \nAvoid reducing the isolation capability, Keep the space underneath \nthe isolator device free from metal such as planes, pads, traces and \nvias.  \nTo minimize the impedance of the signal return loop, keep the solid \nground plane directly underneath the high -speed signal path, the \ncloser the better. The return path will couple between the nearest \nground plane to the signal path. Keep suitable trace width for \ncontrolled impedance transmission lines interconnect.  \nTo reduce the rise time degra dation, keep the length of input/output \nsignal traces as short as possible, and route low inductance loop for \nthe signal path and It’s return path.  \n \nVINVDD1\nVDD1\nGND1GND2VDD2\nVOUT\nGND2VINVDD1\nVDD1\nGND1GND2VDD2\nVOUT\nGND2 \nFigure 9.Recommended Printed Circuit Board Layout  \nJITTER MEASUREMENT  \nThe eye diagram shown in the figure below  provides the jitter \nmeasurement result for the π110M 3x.
