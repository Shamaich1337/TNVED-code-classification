All Rights Reserved. \nOPERATION  \nThe MPM3695-25 is a fully integrated power \nsolution with up to 25A output current in a 10x12x4mm QFN package. For applications that require more than 25A, the MPM3695-25 \ncan be connected in parallel to provide a higher \noutput current. The MPM3695-25 employs \nconstant-on-time (COT) control to provide fast transient response. The internal ramp compensation guarantees stable operation for \napplications using zero-ESR ceramic output \ncapacitors.   \nMulti-Phase Operation  \nIn a multi-phase configuration, one master \nphase and up to five slave phases are connected in parallel. The output current is \nshared equally among all phases. The typical \napplication circuit illustrates four MPM3695-25s \nin a multi-phase configur ation. The TAKE pin of \nthe master phase is required to be pulled up to a voltage source through a resistor. The MPM3695-25 detects its master/slave configuration by monitoring the state of the TAKE pin during start-up.  The PASS and TAKE pins of all phases are connected in a cascaded manner (See Typical Application circuit). The PASS pin of the last slave-phase is connected back to the TAKE pin of the master phase.  \nMCOT Operation-Master Phase \nA master phase performs the following \nfunctions: \n\uf0b7 Accepts both write and read commands \nthrough PMBus from a host \n\uf0b7 Generates the SET signal \n\uf0b7 Manages the start-up, shut-off, and all the \nprotections \n\uf0b7 Monitors fault alerts from the slave phases \nthrough the PG pin \n\uf0b7 Generates the first ON pulse \n\uf0b7 Generates the ON pulse when receiving \nRUN and SET signals \n\uf0b7 Dynamically adjusts its on-time to ensure \nequal current sharing \n\uf0b7 Generates the PASS signal MCOT Operation-Slave Phases \nThe master phase performs the following \nfunctions: \n\uf0b7 Accepts write commands through PMBus \nfrom a host \n\uf0b7 Receives the SET signal from a master \n\uf0b7 Sends an OV/UV/OT fault alert to a master \nphase through the PG pin \n\uf0b7 Starts the ON pulse when receiving RUN \nand SET signals \n\uf0b7 Dynamically adjusts its on-time to ensure \nequal current sharing with its own phase \nbased on the per-phase and total current \n\uf0b7 Generates the PASS signal \nFigure 1 illustrates MCOT operation. At t0, a \nSET pulse is generated by the master phase \nwhen (VFB+RAMP) drops below the reference level (VCOMP). All the phases receive this SET signal, but only the phase (the MASTER) that \nhas an active RUN signal will take action, so \nthe MASTER turns on the High-Side-FET (HS-\nFET). Meanwhile, it generates a fixed width-pulse on the PASS pin, and  passes it to the \nTAKE pin of SLAVE1.  \nAt t1, the falling edge of the TAKE pin of \nSLAVE1 activates the RUN signal. This enables \nthe SLAVE1 to wait for the SET signal to turn on its HS-FET. \nAt t2, the ON time of the PWM signal of the \nMASTER phase expires and the HS-FET is \nturned off. The ON time of the PWM signal is \nfixed for any given input voltage, output voltage \nand switching frequency. The ON time of each \nphase is fine-tuned based on the per phase and the total current to ensure equal current sharing \namong phases. \nAt t3, the (VFB+RAMP) drops below the \nreference level (VCOMP) in the MASTER phase again, only SLAVE1 has an active RUN signal, so it turns on its HS-FET. All other phases ignore this SET signal. Meanwhile, the SLAVE1 generates a pulse with fixed width on the PASS pin, and passes it to the TAKE pin of SLAVE2.\nMPM3695-25 – 16V, 20A, SCALABLE, DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS \nMPM3695-25 Rev. 1.01 www.MonolithicPower.com 22 \n9/9/2019 MPS Proprietary Information. Patent Protected.  Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited. \n © 2019 MPS. All Rights Reserved. \nThe MPM3695-25 keeps above operation and \neach phase turns on its HS-FET one by one for \na fixed ON time. The operation is similar to a \nrelay race and the RUN signal is like the baton. The relay is carried on through the PASS/TAKE loop. Only the phase that has the baton (RUN \nsignal) will turn on the HS-FET when the SET \nsignal is ready.  \nThe MPM3695-25 benefits from MCOT control \nto achieve extremely fast load transient \nresponse. The SET signal is generated more \nfrequently during a load transient compared to steady state (See Figure 2). Consequently, \nenergy is delivered to the load at a higher rate, \nwhich minimizes the output deviation during a \nload transient event. With the MPM3695-25, the \nSET pulses are generated with a minimum 50ns interval, i.e., the next phase can be turned on as fast as 50ns after the turn-on of the \nprevious phase. RAMP Compensation \nThe MPM3695-25 guarantees stable operation \nwith zero-ESR ceramic output capacitors by \nusing internal RAMP compensation. A \ntriangular RAMP signal is generated internally and is superimposed on the FB signal. The triangular RAMP signal starts to rise once RAMP+FB drops below the REF signal, and a SET pulse is generated. The rise time of the RAMP signal is fixed. The amplitude of the RAMP compensation is selectable through the PMBus command of D0h[3:1] to support wide operation configurations. There is a trade-off between the stability and load transient response. A larger RAMP signal provides higher stability but a slower load transient response and vice versa. Consequently, it is necessary to optimize the RAMP compensation \nselection based on the design criteria for each \napplication.   \n  \nMPM3695-25 – 16V, 20A, SCALABLE, DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS \nMPM3695-25 Rev. 1.01 www.MonolithicPower.com 23 \n9/9/2019 MPS Proprietary Information.

All Rights Reserved. \nAPPLICATION INFORMATION  \nOperation Mode Selection \nThe MPM3695-25 provides both forced CCM \nand pulse skip operations in a light-load condition. Four switching frequencies are available for the MPM3695-25. The selection of operation mode in a light-load condition and the switching frequency is done through the PMBus. \nOutput Voltage Setting  \nA feedback resistor divider is required to set the \nproper feedback gain. The values of the feedback resistors are determined using equation 1: \n \n21\nO0.6R ( k) R ( k)V0 . 6\uf057\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf057\uf02d \n(1) \nwhere V o is the output voltage. The output \nvoltage feedback gain is determined with \nequation 2: \n 2\nFB\n12RGRR\uf03d\uf02b (2) \nTo optimize the load transient response, a feed-\nforward capacitor (C FF) is required to be placed \nin parallel with R1. Table 1 lists the values of \nthe feedback resistors and the feedforward \ncapacitor for common output voltages. \nTable 1: Common Output Voltages \nVo R1(kΩ) R2(kΩ) C FF(nF)\n0.9 0.5 1 33 \n1.2 1 1 33 \n1.8 2 1 33 \n3.3 4.53 1 4.7 \n5 7.32 1 4.7 \nThe MPM3695-25 offers output voltage \nprogrammability through PMBus. In addition, the output voltage can be adjusted within a \ncertain range through PMBus by adjusting the \ninternal reference voltage of the PMW controller \n(V\nREF). The reference voltage, which has a \ndefault value of 0.6V, can be adjusted between 0.5V to 0.672V. For a given feedback resistor \nnetwork, the upper and lower limits of the \noutput voltage are determined with equation 3a \nand equation 3b: \n \no,max\nFB0.672VG\uf03d  (3a)  \uf03do,min\nFB0.5VG (3b) \nTwo steps need to be followed to program the \noutput voltage through PMBus: \n1. Write G FB value determined by Equation 2 \nto register VOUT_SCALE_LOOP (29h) \n2. Write the output voltage command to \nregister VOUT_COMMAND (21h) \nVREF is updated automatically based on the \noutput voltage command and G FB \nOutput voltage monitoring through PMBus is \nenabled by setting the register \nVOUT_SCALE_LOOP (29h) with a value that \nmatches the G FB calculated with Equation 2.  \nFor applications where a PMBus interface is not \nrequired, V REF=0.6V is used by default, and the \nMPM3695-25 operates in analog mode. The \nfeedback resistors should be determined based on Equation 1.  \nSoft Start \nThe soft start (SS) time can be programmed \nthrough PMBus. The default SS time is 2ms.  \nPre-Bias Start-Up \nThe MPM3695-25 is designed for monotonic \nstartup into pre-biased loads. If the output \nvoltage is pre-biased to a certain voltage during \nstartup, both the high-side and low-side \nswitches are disabled until the internal \nreference voltage exceeds the sensed output voltage at the FB pin.  \nOutput Voltage Discharge \nThe output voltage discharge mode will be \nenabled if the MPM3695-25 is disabled through \nthe CTRL pin. In such a case, both the high-side and low-side switches are latched off. A discharge FET connected between SW and \nGND is turned on to discharge the output \ncapacitor. A typical on-resistance of the \ndischarge FET is 60 Ω. Once the FB voltage \ndrops below 10% of the reference output voltage, the discharge FET is turned off. \nThis feature can be enabled or disabled through \nthe MFR_CTRL_VOUT (D1h) command. \nMPM3695-25 – 16V, 20A, SCALABLE, DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS \nMPM3695-25 Rev. 1.01 www.MonolithicPower.com 24 \n9/9/2019 MPS Proprietary Information.

All Rights Reserved. \nCurrent Sense and Over-Current Protection \n(OCP)  \nThe MPM3695-25 features on-die current \nsense and a programmable positive current limit threshold.  \nThe MPM3695-25 provides both inductor valley \ncurrent limits (set by register D7h). \nInductor Valley Over-Current Protection \n(D7h)  \nDuring the LS-FET ON state, the inductor \ncurrent is sensed and monitored cycle-by-cycle. \nThe HS-FET will only be allowed to turn ON if \nover-current is not detected during the LS-FET \nON-state. If there are 31 consecutive cycles of \nan OC condition detected, OCP is triggered.  \nDuring an over-current condition or output \nshort-circuit condition, if the output voltage drops below the under-voltage protection (UVP) threshold, the MPM3695-25 enters OCP \nimmediately.  \nOnce OCP is triggered, it either enters HICCUP \nmode or latch-off mode, depending on the register. It should be noted that a power-recycle of the Vcc or CTRL is required to re-enable the MPM3695-25 once it latches-off.  \nThe inductor valley over-current limit can be \nprogrammed through register D7h, which sets \nthe per-phase inductor valley current limit for \nboth single and multi-phase operation.  \nNegative Inductor Current limit \nWhen the LS-FET detects a negative current \nlower than the limit set through register D5h[2], the part will turn off its LS-FET for a period of \ntime to limit the negative current. The period is \nset through register D5h[3]. \nUnder -Voltage Protection (UVP) \nThe MPM3695-25 monitors the output voltage \nthrough the FB pin to detect an under-voltage \ncondition. If the FB voltage drops below the \nUVP threshold (set through register \nVOUT_UV_FAULT_LIMIT), the UVP is \ntriggered. After UVP is triggered, the MPM3695-25 enters either HICCUP or latch-off \nmode, depending  on the PMBus selection. \nPlease note that a power-recycle of the Vcc or CTRL is required to re-enable the MPM3695-25 \nonce it latches off. Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) \nThe MPM3695-25 monitors the output voltage \nusing the FB pin connected to the tap of a \nresistor divider to detect an over-voltage \ncondition. Please refer to the register VOUT_OV_FAULT_RESPONSE section for additional information on OVP. \nOutput Sinking Mode (OSM) \nThe MPM3695-25 enters the OSM when the \noutput voltage is more than 5% higher than the \nreference and below the OVP threshold. Once the OSM is triggered, the MPM3695-25 runs in forced CCM. The MPM3695-25 exits OSM \nmode when the HS-FET turns back on.  \nOver-Temperature Protection (OTP) \nThe MPM3695-25 monitors the junction \ntemperature. If the junction temperature exceeds the threshold value (set by register OT_FAULT_LIMIT), the converter enters either HICCUP or latch-off mode depending on the PMBus selection. Please note that a power-recycle of the Vcc or CTRL is required to re-enable the  MPM3695-25 once it latches off. \nPower Good (PG) \nThe MPM3695-25 has an open-drain power-\ngood (PG) output. The PG pin can be \nconfigured as an output only or input and output pin by bit [0] of register MRF_CTRL_COMP (D0h).  For single-phase configuration, the PG \npin should be configured as output only. For \nmulti-phase operation, the PG pin should be \nconfigured as an input and output pin to detect faults from the slave phases. The PG pin must be pulled high, to V\nCC or a voltage source, with \nless than 3.6V through a pull-up resistor (typically 100k Ω). \nPG is pulled low initially once input voltage is \napplied to the MPM3695-25. After the FB \nvoltage reaches the threshold set by register \nPOWER_GOOD_ON, the PG pin is pulled high \nafter a delay set by the register \nMFR_CTRL_VOUT.  \nPG is latched low if any fault occurs, and the \nrelevant protection feature is triggered (e.g., UV, OV, OT, UVLO, etc.). After the PG is latched low, it cannot be pulled high again unless a new \nsoft-start is initialized. \nMPM3695-25 – 16V, 20A, SCALABLE, DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS \nMPM3695-25 Rev. 1.01 www.MonolithicPower.com 25 \n9/9/2019 MPS Proprietary Information.

The relationship \nbetween the PG voltage and the pull-up current \nis shown in Figure 3.  \n  \nFigure 3: Power-Good Current vs. Power-Good \nVoltage \nInput Capacitor \nThe input current to a buck converter is \ndiscontinuous, and therefore, requires a capacitor to supply the AC current to the step-\ndown module while maintaining the DC input \nvoltage. Use ceramic capacitors for the best \nperformance. During layout, place the input capacitors as close to the IN pin as possible.  \nThe capacitance can vary significantly with \ntemperature. Use capacitors with X5R and X7R ceramic dielectrics, because they are fairly \nstable over a wide temperature range.  \nThe capacitors must also have a ripple current \nrating that exceeds the converter’s maximum input ripple current. Estimate the input ripple current using equation 4: \n \n)VV1(VVI I\nINOUT\nINOUT\nOUT CIN \uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d  (4) \nThe worst-case condition occurs at V IN = 2V OUT, \nwhere: \n 2IIOUT\nCIN\uf03d  (5) \nFor simplification, choose an input capacitor \nwith an RMS current rating that exceeds half the maximum load current. \nThe input capacitance value determines the \nconverter input voltage ripple.

When using ceramic capacitors, the \ncapacitance dominates the impedance at the \nswitching frequency. The capacitance also dominates the output voltage ripple.

For optimal performance, \nfollow the guidelines below: \n1. Place the input ceramic capacitors as close \nto the VIN and PGND pins as possible on the same layer of the MPM3695-25. \nMaximize the VIN and PGND copper plane \nto minimize the parasitic impedance.  \n2. Place VIN vias at least 1cm from the part to \nminimize noise coupling from input \npulsating current. \n3. Connect AGND to a solid ground plane \nthrough a single point.   \n4. Place sufficient output GND vias close to \nthe GND pins to minimize both parasitic impedance and thermal resistance. \n5. Keep the ISUM trace as short as possible. \nThe ISUM trace should be away from the \nVIN copper in a multi-phase configuration. \nVias should be avoided whenever possible. \n6. The keep-out area must be kept clean. \nSignal traces should avoid the area directly \nbeneath the SW pad unless a PGND layer is used to provide shielding.  \n  \nFigure 4.

All Rights Reserved. \nPMBUS INTERFACE \nPMBus Serial Interface Description \nThe power management bus (PMBus) is a two-\nwire, bidirectional serial interface, consisting of a data line (SDA) and a clock line (SCL). The \nlines are externally pulled to a bus voltage \nwhen they are “idle”. Connecting to the line, a \nmaster device generates the SCL signal and \ndevice address and arranges the communication sequence. It is based on the principles of I\n2C operation. The MPM3695-25 \ninterface is a PMBus slave, which will support \nboth the standard mode (100kHz) and fast \nmode (400kHz and 1000KHz). The PMBus interface adds flexibilit y to the power supply \nsolution. \nDevice Address \nTo manage multiple MPM3695-25s through the \nsame PMBus, use the ADDR pin to program the device address for the MPM3695-25s; there is a 10µA current flow out of the ADDR pin. Connect a resistor between the ADDR pin and AGND to set the ADDR voltage. The internal ADC converts the pin voltage to set the PMBus address. A maximum of 16 addresses can be set by the ADDR pin. The MFR_ ADDR_PMBUS (F1h) register can be used to set the PMBus address digitally.  \nAfter the address is selected, each device must \nhave a unique address during normal operation. \nTable 2 shows ADDR resistor values versus the \nPMBus address. Table 2: PMBus Address vs. ADDR Resistor \nRADDR (kΩ) Device Address\n4.99 30h \n15 31h \n24.9 32h \n34.8 33h \n45.3 34h \n54.9 35h \n64.9 36h \n75 37h \n84.5 38h \n95.3 39h \n105 3Ah \n115 3Bh \n124 3Ch \n133 3Dh \n147 3Eh \n154 3Fh \nStart and Stop Conditions \nThe START/STOP are signaled by the master \ndevice, which signifies the beginning and the \nend of the PMBus data transfer. The START \ncondition is defined as the SDA signal transitioning from HIGH to LOW while the SCL is HIGH. The STOP condition is defined as the \nSDA signal transitioning from LOW to HIGH \nwhile the SCL is HIGH (See Figure 8). \nThe master thengenerates the SCL clocks, and \ntransmits the device address and the read/write direction bit R/W on the SDA line. Data is \ntransferred in 8 bit bytes by the SDA line. Each \nbyte of data is followed by an acknowledge bit.  \nPMBus Update Sequence \nThe MPM3695-25 requires a start condition, a \nvalid PMBus address, a register address byte, \nand a data byte for a single data packet update. \nAfter receipt of each byte, the MPM3695-25 \nacknowledges by pulling the SDA line low during the high period of a single clock pulse. A valid PMBus address selects the MPM3695-25. \nThe MPM3695-25 performs an update on the \nfalling edge of the LSB byte. \nMPM3695-25 – 16V, 20A, SCALABLE, DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS \n \nMPM3695-25 Rev. 1.01 www.MonolithicPower.com 30 \n9/9/2019 MPS Proprietary Information.

All Rights Reserved. \nProtocol Usage  \nAll PMBus transactions on the MPM3695-25 \nare done using defined bus protocols. The \nfollowing protocols are implemented: \n• Send byte with PEC \n• Receive byte with PEC \n• Write byte with PEC \n• Read byte with PEC \n• Write word with PEC \n• Read word with PEC \n• Block read with PEC \nPMBus Bus Message Format \nIn figures a-g below, unshaded cells indicate \nthat the bus host is actively driving the bus; shaded cells indicate that the MPM3695-25 is driving the bus. \nS = start condition  \nSr = repeated start condition  P = stop condition \nR = read bit  \nW= write bit  \nA = acknowledge bit (0)  \nA= acknowledge bit (1) \n“A” represents the ACK (acknowledge) bit. The \nACK bit is typically active low (Logic 0) if the transmitted byte is successfully received by a \ndevice. However, when the receiving device is \nthe bus master, the acknowledge bit for the last \nbyte read is a Logic 1, indicated by\nA. \nPacket Error Checking (PEC) \nThe MPM3695-25 PMBus interface supports \nthe use of the packet error checking (PEC) byte. The PEC byte is transmitted by the MPM3695-25 during a read transaction or sent by the bus \nhost to the MPM3695-25 during a write \ntransaction.  The PEC byte is used by the bus host or the \nMPM3695-25 to detect errors during a bus transaction, depending on whether the \ntransaction is a read or a write. If the host \ndetermines that the PEC byte read during a \nread transaction is incorrect, it can decide to \nrepeat the read. If the MPM3695-25 determines that the PEC byte sent during a write \ntransaction is incorrect, it ignores the command \n(does not execute it), and it sets a status flag. \nWithin a group command, the host can choose \nto send or not send a PEC byte as part of the message to the MPM3695-25. \nPMBus Alert Response Address (ARA) \nThe PMBus alert response address (ARA) is a \nspecial address that can be used by the bus \nhost to locate any devices that need to talk to it. \nA host typically uses a hardware interrupt pin to monitor the PMBus ALERT pins of a number of \ndevices. When the host interrupt occurs, the \nhost issues a message on the bus using the \nPMBus receive byte or receive byte with PEC \nprotocol.  \nThe special address used by the host is 0x0C. \nAny devices that have a PMBus alert signal return their own 7-bit address as the seven MSBs of the data byte. The LSB value is not used and can be either 1 or 0. The host reads the device address from the received data byte \nand proceeds to handle the alert condition.  \nMore than one device may have an active \nPMBus alert signal and attempt to communicate with the host. In this case, the device with the \nlowest address dominates the bus and \nsucceeds in transmitting its address to the host. \nThe device that succeeds disables its PMBus \nalert signal. If the host sees that the PMBus alert signal is still low, it continues to read \naddresses until all devices that need to talk to it \nhave successfully transmitted their addresses. \n \n \nFigure 8: Data Transfer over PMBus \nMPM3695-25 – 16V, 20A, SCALABLE, DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS \n \nMPM3695-25 Rev. 1.01 www.MonolithicPower.com 31 \n9/9/2019 MPS Proprietary Information.

The OPERATION command is used to turn the converter output \non/off in conjunction with input from the CTRL pin. It is also used to set the output voltage to the upper or lower MARGIN voltages. The unit stays in the commanded operating mode until a subsequent OPERATION command or a change in the state of the CTRL pin instructs the converter to change to another mode. This OPERATION command is also used to re-enable the converter after a fault triggered shutdown. Writing an OFF command followed by an ON comm and will clear all faults. Writing \nonly an ON command after a fault-triggered shutdown will not clear the fault registers. \nCommand  OPERATION \nFormat  Unsigned binary \nBit 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nAccess  r/w r/w r/w r/w r/w r/w r r \nF u n c t i o n         x  x  \n \nBit[7:6] Bit[5:4] Bit[3:2] Bit[1:0] On/off Margin state \n00 xx  xx Xx Immediate off N/A \n01 Xx xx Xx Soft off N/A \n10 00 xx Xx on off \n10 01 01 Xx on Margin low (ignore fault) \n10 01 10 Xx on Margin low (act on fault) \n10 10 01 Xx on Margin high (ignore fault) \n10 10 10 Xx on Margin high (act on fault) \nON_OFF_CONFIG (02h) \nThe ON_OFF_CONFIG command configures the combination of the CTRL pin input and the PMBus \ncommands needed to turn the converter on and off. This includes how the converter responds when input voltage is applied. \nCommand  OPERATION \nFormat  Unsigned binary \nBit 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nAccess  r r r r/w r/w r/w r/w r \nFunction  X X X pon op en pol dly \npon \nThe pon bit sets the default to either operate any time the input voltage is present or for the on/off to be \ncontrolled by the CTRL pin and PMBus commands. \nBit[4] Value Meaning \n0 Converter powers up any time the input volt age is present regardless of state of the \nCTRL pin \n1 Converter does not power up until commanded by the CTRL pin and OPERATION \ncommand (as programmed in bits[3:0]) \nop \nThe op bit controls how the converter responds to the OPERATION commands. \nBit[3] Value Meaning \n0 Converter ignores the “on” bit in the OPERATION command from the PMBus \n1 Converter responses the “on” bit in  the OPERATION command from the PMBus \nMPM3695-25 – 16V, 20A, SCALABLE, DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS \n \nMPM3695-25 Rev. 1.01 www.MonolithicPower.com 36 \n9/9/2019 MPS Proprietary Information. Patent Protected.  Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited. \n © 2019 MPS. All Rights Reserved. \nen \nThis en bit controls how the converter responds to the CTRL pin. \nBit[2] Value Meaning \n0 Converter ignores the CTRL pin (on/off controlled only by the OPERATION \ncommand). \n1 Converter requires the CTRL pin to be asserted to power up. \nDepending on the bit[3] op bit, the OPERATION command may also be required to instruct the converter to power up. \npol \nThe pol bit sets the polarity of the CTRL pin. \nBit[1] Value Meaning \n0 Active low (Pull CTRL pin low to start the converter) \n1 Active high (Pull CTRL pin high to start the converter) \ndly The dly bit sets the turn off action when the converter is commanded off. This bit is read only and can’t \nbe modified by the end user. \nBit[0] Value Meaning \n0 TOFF_DELAY, TOFF_FALL \nCLEAR_FAULTS (03h) \nThe CLEAR_FAULTS command is used to reset all stored warning and fault flags. If a fault or warning \ncondition still exists when the CLEAR_FAULTS comm and is issued, the ALT# signal may not be \ncleared or will be re-asserted almost immediatel y. Issuing a CLEAR_FAULTS command will not cause \nthe converter to restart in the event of a fault turn-off. It must be done by issuing an OPERATION \ncommand after the fault condition is cleared. This command uses the PMBus to send byte protocol. \nWRITE PROTECT (10h) \nThe WRITE_PROTECT command is used to control writing to the converter. The intent of this \ncommand is to provide protection against accident changes. It’s not intended to provide protection \nagainst deliberate or malicious changes to the converter’s configuration or operation.  \nAll the supported commands may have their parameters read, regardless of the WRITE_PROTECT \nsettings.  \nBit[7:0] Value Meaning \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Enable writes to all commands. \n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 Disable all writes except to the WRITE_PROTECT, OPERATION, PAGE, \nON_OFF_CONFIG and VOUT_COMMAND commands. \n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 Disable all writes except to the WRITE_PROTECT, OPERATION and PAGE \ncommands. \n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Disable all writes except to the WRITE_PROTECT command. \nSTORE_USER_ALL (15h) \nWrite all the data from the registers to the internal MTPs. This process will operate when the \nMPM3695-25 receives a STORE_USER_ALL command from the PMBus interface. Currently the \nMPM3695-25 doesn’t support the standard 15h command. However, it can accept a 15h command from the MPS GUI for the MPM3695-25. See the “MTP Programming” section for additional details. \nMPM3695-25 – 16V, 20A, SCALABLE, DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS \n \nMPM3695-25 Rev. 1.01 www.MonolithicPower.com 37 \n9/9/2019 MPS Proprietary Information.

The values in the registers are overwritten by the value \nretrieved from the MTP. Any items in the MTPs that do not have matching locations in the operating memory are ignored. \nThe RESTORE_USER_ALL command can be used while the MPM3695-25 is operating.  \nPlease Note: While the RESTORE_USER_ALL command can be used, the MPM3695-25 may be \nunresponsive during the copy operation with unpredicta ble, undesirable, or even catastrophic results. \nThis command is write only.\n \nCAPABILITY (19h) \nThe CAPABILITY command return s information about the PMBus functions supported by the \nMPM3695-25.
