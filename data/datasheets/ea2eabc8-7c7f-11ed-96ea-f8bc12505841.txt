General description\nStandard level N-channel MOSFET in a D2PAK package qualified to 175 °C. Part of  \nNexperia \'s "NextPower Live" portfolio, the PSMN4R8-100BSE complements the latest \n"hot-swap" controllers - robust enough to withstand substantial inrush currents during turn \non, whilst offering a low R DS(on)  characteristic to keep temperatures down and efficiency \nup in  continued use. Ideal for telecommunication systems based on a 48 V backplane / \nsupply  rail.\n2. Features and benefits\n•Enhanced forward biased safe operating area for superior linear mode operation\n•Very low R DS(on)  for low conduction losses\n3. Applications\n•Electronic fuse\n•Hot swap\n•Load switch\n•Soft start\n4. Quick reference data\nTable 1.

#### Description:
The PSMN4R8-100BSE is a standard level N-channel MOSFET designed for high-performance applications. It features a low on-resistance (RDS(on)) of 4.8 mΩ, which minimizes conduction losses and enhances efficiency. This MOSFET is part of Nexperia's "NextPower Live" portfolio and is qualified for operation at high temperatures (up to 175 °C). It is particularly robust, capable of handling substantial inrush currents during turn-on, making it suitable for demanding applications.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Electronic Fuse:** Used to protect circuits by interrupting current flow in case of overload.
- **Hot Swap Controllers:** Allows components to be added or removed from a live circuit without interrupting the power supply.
- **Load Switches:** Controls the power to various loads in a circuit, enabling or disabling them as needed.
- **Soft Start Circuits:** Gradually increases the power to a load to prevent inrush current and reduce stress on components.

This MOSFET is ideal for use in telecommunication systems, particularly those utilizing a 48 V backplane or supply rail, due to its high efficiency and thermal performance.
