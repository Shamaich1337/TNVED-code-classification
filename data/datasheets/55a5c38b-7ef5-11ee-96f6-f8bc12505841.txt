Please also refer to the common precautions for Fixed \n Resistors in this catalog.\n1.Take measures against mechanical stress during and after mounting of Surface Mount Resistors \n (hereafter called the resistors) so as not to damage their electrodes and protective coatings.\nBe careful not to misplace the resistors on the land patterns. Otherwise, solder bridging may occur.\n2.Keep the rated power and ambient temperature within the specified derating curve.\nSome circuit boards, wiring patterns, temperatures of heat generated by adjacent components, or \nambient temper a tures can become factors in the rise of the temperature of the resistors, regardless of\nthe level of power applied. Therefore, check the conditions before use and op timize them so as not to  \ndamage the boards and peripheral components. \nMake sure to contact us before using the resistors under special conditions.\n3.If a transient load (heavy load in a short time) like a pulse is expected to be applied, check and evaluate \nthe operations of the resistors when installed in your products before use. Never exceed the rated power.\nOtherwise, the performance and/or reliability of the resistors may be impaired.\n4.Transient voltage \nIf there is a possibility that the transient phenomenon (significantly high voltage applied in a short time) \nmay occur or that a high voltage pulse may be applied, make sure to evaluate and check the\ncharacteristics of resistors mounted on your product rather than only depending on the calculated power \nlimit or steady-state conditions.\n5.If the resistors are to be used in high frequency circuits, carefully check the operation before use.  \nSuch circuits change the electrical characteristics of the resistors.\n6.\nperformance and reliability of the resistors.\n7.When soldering with a soldering iron, never touch the resistors\'bodies with the tip of the soldering iron. \nWhen using a soldering iron with a high temperature tip, finish soldering as quickly as possible\n (within three seconds at 350 °C max.).\n8.Mounting of the resistors with excessive or insufficient wetting amount of solder may affect the \nconnection reliability or the performance of the resistors.  Carefully check the effects and apply a proper \namount of solder for use.\n9.When the resistors\' protective coatings are chipped, flawed, or removed, the characteristics of the \nresistors may be impaired. Take special care not to apply mechanical shock during automatic mounting\nor cause damage during handling of the boards with the resistors mounted.\n10. Do not apply shock to the resistors or pinch them with a hard tool (e.g. pliers and tweezers). Otherwise, \nthe resistors\' protective coatings and bodies may be chipped, affecting their performance.\n11. Avoid excessive bending of printed circuit boards in order to protect the resistors from abnormal stress.\n12. Do not immerse the resistors in solvent for a long time. \nBefore using solvent, carefully check the effects of immersion.\n13. Do not apply excessive tension to the terminals.Before using halogen-based or other high-activity flux, check the possible effects of the flux residues on the\n01-Oct-19\n\nMouser Electronics\n  \nAuthorized Distributor\n \n  \nClick to View Pricing, Inventory, Delivery & Lifecycle Information:\n \n \n \n Panasonic:   \n\xa0 ERJ-6GEYJ152V\xa0 ERJ-12ZYJ390U\xa0 ERJ-12ZYJ100U\xa0 ERJ-14YJ331U\xa0 ERJ-1TY0R00U\xa0 ERJ-1TYJ910U\xa0 ERJ-\n12ZYJ330U\xa0 ERJ-14YJ1R6U\xa0 ERJ-12ZYJ221U\xa0 ERJ-12ZYJ4R7U\xa0 ERJ-1TYJ301U\xa0 ERJ-1TYJ560U\xa0 ERJ-14YJ181U\xa0\nERJ-12ZYJ473U\xa0 ERJ-1TYJ133U\xa0 ERJ-1TYJ821U\xa0 ERJ-14YJ472U\xa0 ERJ-1TYJ131U\xa0 ERJ-6GEYJ221V\xa0 ERJ-\n8GEYJ683V\xa0 ERJ-14YJ151U\xa0 ERJ-2GEJ225X\xa0 ERJ-1TYJ130U\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ113V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ622V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ7R5V\n\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ563V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ564V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ565V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ6R2V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ6R8V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ515V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ621V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ623V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ624V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ625V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ681V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ683V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ684V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ395V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ620V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ430V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ432V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ433V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ434V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ435V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ560V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ475V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ5R1V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ5R6V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ685V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ824V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ755V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ8R2V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ825V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ9R1V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ911V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ912V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ913V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ914V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ915V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ2R0V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ163V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ164V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ165V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ181V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ182V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ2R4V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ2R7V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ204V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ184V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ115V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ120V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ123V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ124V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ125V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ162V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ133V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ134V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ135V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ150V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ153V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ154V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ155V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ205V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ304V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ305V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ333V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ335V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ361V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ364V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ365V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ390V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ392V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ334V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ223V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ225V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ240V\xa0 ERJ-\n3GEYJ243V\xa0 ERJ-3GEYJ302V\n'}]
