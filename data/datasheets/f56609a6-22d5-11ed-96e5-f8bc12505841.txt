The I/O V CC− and I/O\nVL−ports are designed to track two different power supply rails, V CC\nand V L respectively. The V CC supply rail is configurable from 1.3 V\nto 4.5 V while the V L supply rail is configurable from 0.9 V to (V CC\n− 0.4) V. This allows lower voltage logic signals on the V L side to be\ntranslated into higher voltage logic signals on the V CC side, and\nvice−versa. Both I/O ports are auto−sensing; thus, no direction pin is\nrequired.\nThe Output Enable (EN) input, when Low, disables both I/O ports\nby putting them in 3−state. This significantly reduces the supplycurrents from both V\nCC and V L. The EN signal is designed to track\nVL.\nFeatures\n•Wide High−Side V CC Operating Range: 1.3 V to 4.5 V \nWide Low−Side V L Operating Range: 0.9 V to (V CC − 0.4) V\n•Power Supply Isolation\n♦All Outputs are in the High Impedance State if Either V L or V CC\nis at Ground\n•High−Speed with 100 Mb/s Guaranteed Date Rate for V L > 1.6 V\n•Low Bit−to−Bit Skew\n•Overvoltage Tolerant Enable and I/O Pins\n•Non−preferential Powerup Sequencing\n•Small packaging: 1.7 mm x 2.0 mm UQFN12\n•NLV Prefix for Automotive and Other Applications Requiring\nUnique Site and Control Change Requirements; AEC−Q100\nQualified and PPAP Capable\n•These are Pb−Free Devices\nTypical Applications\n•Mobile Phones, PDAs, Other Portable Deviceswww. onsemi.com\nUQFN12\nMU SUFFIX\nCASE 523AEMARKING\nDIAGRAMS\nWAM /C0071\n/C0071\n1\nDevice Package Shipping†ORDERING INFORMATION\nNLSX4014MUT AG UQFN12\n(Pb−Free)3000/T ape & Ree l\n†For information on tape and reel specifications,\nincluding part orientation and tape sizes, please\nrefer to our Tape and Reel Packaging SpecificationBrochure, BRD801 1/D.NLSX4014DR2G SO−14\n(Pb−Free)2500/T ape & Ree l\nNLSX4014DTR2G TSSOP14\n(Pb−Free)2500/T ape & Ree lSOIC−14\nD SUFFIX\nCASE 751A14\n1NLSX4014G\nAWLYWW\n114\nTSSOP−14\nDT SUFFIX\nCASE 948G14\n1NLSX\n4014\nALYW /C0071\n/C0071\n114\nA = Assembly Location\nL, WL = Wafer Lot\nY, YY = Year\nW, WW = Work Week\nG or /C0071 = Pb−Free Package\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)WA = Specific Device Code\nM = Date Code\n/C0071 = Pb−Free Package\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)\nNLVSX4014MUT AG UQFN12\n(Pb−Free)3000/T ape & Ree l\nNLSX4014\nwww. onsemi.com\n2Figure 1.

This device has twosupply voltages, V\nL and V CC, which set the logic levels on\nthe input and output sides of the translator. When used to\ntransfer data from the V L to the V CC ports, input signals\nreferenced to the V L supply are translated to output signals\nwith a logic level matched to V CC. In a similar manner, the\nVCC to V L translation shifts input signals with a logic level\ncompatible to V CC to an output signal matched to V L.\nThe NLSX4014 consists of four bi−directional channels\nthat independently determine the direction of the data flowwithout requiring a directional pin. The one−shot circuitsare used to detect the rising or falling input signals. Inaddition, the one shots decrease the rise and fall time of the\noutput signal for high−to−low and low−to−high transitions.\nInput Driver Requirements\nFor proper operation, the input driver to the auto sense\ntranslator should be capable of driving 2.0 mA of peakoutput current.\nOutput Load Requirements\nThe NLSX4014 is designed to drive CMOS inputs.\nResistive pullup or pulldown loads of less than 50 k /C0087\nshould not be used with this device. The NLSX3373 or\nNLSX3378 open−drain auto sense translators are alternatetranslator options for an application such as the I\n2C bus that\nrequires pullup resistors.\nEnable Input (EN)\nThe NLSX4014 has an Enable pin (EN) that provides\ntri−state operation at the I/O pins. Driving the Enable pin\nto a low logic level minimizes the power consumption ofthe device and drives the I/O V\nCC and I/O V L pins to a high\nimpedance state. Normal translation operation occurswhen the EN pin is equal to a logic high signal. The EN pin\nis referenced to the V\nL supply and has Over−Voltage\nTolerant (OVT) protection.Uni−Directional versus Bi−Directional Translation\nThe NLSX4014 can function as a non−inverting\nuni−directional translator. One advantage of using thetranslator as a uni−directional device is that each I/O pincan be configured as either an input or output. Theconfigurable input or output feature is especially useful in\napplications such as SPI that use multiple uni−directional\nI/O lines to send data to and from a device. The flexible I/O\nport of the auto sense translator simplifies the traceconnections on the PCB.\nPower Supply Guidelines\nIt is recommended that the V L supply should be less than\nor equal to the value of the V CC minus 0.4 V. The\nsequencing of the power supplies will not damage thedevice during the power up operation; however, the current\nconsumption of the device will increase if V\nL exceeds V CC\nminus 0.4 V. In addition, the I/O V CC and I/O V L pins are\nin the high impedance state if either supply voltage is equal\nto 0 V.\nFor optimal performance, 0.01 to 0.1 /C0109F decoupling\ncapacitors should be used on the V L and V CC power supply\npins. Ceramic capacitors are a good design choice to filterand bypass any noise signals on the power supply voltage\nlines to the ground plane of the PCB. The noise immunity\nwill be maximized by placing the capacitors as close aspossible to the supply and ground pins, along withminimizing the PCB connection traces.\nThe NLSX4014 provides power supply isolation if either\nsupply voltage V\nL or V CC is equal to 0 V. The isolation\noccurs because the I/O pins are in the high impedance state.\nIt is recommended that pulldown resistors should be usedif the V\nL or V CC are floated or in a high impedance state.\nA pulldown resistor connected from the supply voltage toground ensures that the translator’s supply voltage is equal\nto 0 V.\nUQFN12 1.7x2.0, 0.4P\nCASE 523AE −01\nISSUE A\nDATE 11 JUN 2007ÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉSCALE 4:1\nA\nbA10.05 C\nSEATING\nPLANE\nNOTE 3NOTES:\n1.

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +85 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - UQFN12 (1.7 mm x 2.0 mm)

- **Special Features or Notes:**
  - Bi-directional level translation without a direction control pin.
  - Auto-sensing I/O ports.
  - Overvoltage tolerant enable and I/O pins.
  - Power supply isolation when either VCC or VL is at ground.
  - AEC-Q100 qualified for automotive applications.
  - Pb-Free device.

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (JEDEC J-STD-020E):**
  - Level 1 (unlimited floor life at <30 °C/85% RH)

**Description of the Component:**
The NLSX4014 is a 4-bit configurable dual-supply bidirectional level translator. It is designed to facilitate communication between devices operating at different voltage levels, allowing lower voltage logic signals on one side (VL) to be translated into higher voltage logic signals on the other side (VCC), and vice versa. The device does not require a direction control pin, making it user-friendly and versatile for various applications.

**Typical Applications:**
- Mobile phones and PDAs
- Other portable devices that require level shifting between different voltage domains
- Communication interfaces in mixed-voltage systems
- Automotive applications where voltage level translation is necessary
- General-purpose logic level translation in digital circuits

This component is particularly useful in scenarios where devices with different operating voltages need to communicate, such as interfacing a 1.8V microcontroller with a 3.3V sensor or peripheral.
