Handling \nPrecautions ◆Handling \n1. Keep the product away from all magnets and magnetic objects.  \n◆Breakaway PC boards (splitting along perforations) \n1. When splitting the PC board after mounting product, care sho uld be taken not to give any stresses of deflection or twisting  to the board. \n2. Board separation should not be done manually, but by using t he appropriate devices. \n◆Mechanical considerations \n1. Please do not give the product any excessive mechanical shoc ks. \n2. Please do not add any shock and power to a product in transp ortation. \n◆Pick-up pressure \n1. Please do not push to add any pressure to a winding part. Pl ease do not give any shock and push into a ferrite core exposur e part. \n◆Packing \n1. Please avoid accumulation of a packing box as much as possib le. \nTechnical \nconsiderations ◆Handling \n1. There is a case that a characteristic varies with magnetic i nfluence. \n◆Breakaway PC boards (splitting along perforations) \n1. The position of the product on PCBs shall be carefully consi dered to minimize the stress caused from splitting of the PCBs.  \n◆Mechanical considerations \n1. There is a case to be damaged by a mechanical shock. 2. There is a case to be broken by the handling in transportati on. \n◆Pick-up pressure \n1. Damage and a characteristic can vary with an excessive shock  or stress. \n◆Packing \n1. If packing boxes are accumulated, that could cause a deforma tion on packing tapes or a damage on the products. \n \n7. Storage conditions \nPrecautions ◆Storage \n1. To maintain the solderability of terminal electrodes and to keep the packing material in good condition, temperature and hu midity in the \nstorage area should be controlled. ・ Recommended conditions \nAmbient temperature : 0～40℃ Humidity : Below 70% RH \n・ The ambient temperature must be kept below 30℃. Even under id eal storage conditions, solderab ility of products electrodes ma y \ndecrease as time passes. For this reason, product should be used within 6 months from th e time of delivery. \nIn case of storage ove r 6 months, solderab ility shall be checke d before actual usage. \nTechnical \nconsiderations ◆Storage \n1. Under a high temperature and humidity environment, problems such as reduced solderability caus ed by oxidation of terminal e lectrodes \nand deterioration of taping/packaging materials may take place.  \n \n \nMouser Electronics\n  \nAuthorized Distributor\n \n  \nClick to View Pricing, Inventory, Delivery & Lifecycle Information:\n \n \n \n Taiyo Yuden:   \n\xa0 MEKK2016T2R2M\xa0 MEKK2016T1R0M\xa0 MEKK2016TR47M\xa0 MEKK2520T1R0M\xa0 MEKK2520TR47M\xa0\nMEKK2520TR33M\xa0 MEKK2520T2R2M\xa0 MEKK2520T4R7M\xa0 MEKK2016TR68M\xa0 MEKK2520T1R5M\xa0 MEKK2012HR47M\n"}]
