GENERAL  DESCRIPTION\nMX25L25673G is 256Mb bits Serial NOR Flash memory, which is configured as 33,554,432 x 8 internally. When it \nis in two or four I/O mode, the structure becomes 134,217,728 bits x 2 or 67,108,864 bits x 4. \nMX25L25673G features a serial peripheral interface and software protocol allowing operation on a simple 3-wire \nbus while it is in single I/O mode. The three bus signals are a clock input (SCLK), a serial data input (SI), and a serial data output (SO). Serial  access to the device is enabled by CS# input.\nWhen it is in two I/O read mode, the SI pin and SO pin become SIO0 pin and SIO1 pin for address/dummy bits input and data output. When it is in four I/O read mode, the SI pin and SO pin become SIO0 pin and SIO1 pin for address/dummy bits input and data output.\nThe MX25L25673G \nMXSMIO® (Serial Multi I/O) provides sequential read operation on the whole chip.\nAfter program/erase command is issued, auto program/erase algorithms which program/erase and verify the \nspecified page or sector/block locations will be executed. Program command is executed on byte basis, or page (256 bytes) basis, or word basis. Erase command is executed on 4K-byte sector, 32K-byte block, or 64K-byte block, or whole chip basis.\nTo provide user with ease of interface, a status register is included to indicate the status of the chip. The status read \ncommand can be issued to detect completion status of a program or erase operation via WIP bit.\nAdvanced security features enhance the protection and security functions, please refer to the security features \nsection for more details.\nWhen the device is not in operation and CS# is high, it will remain in standby mode.The MX25L25673G utilizes Macronix\'s proprietary memory cell, which reliably stores memory contents even after \n100,000 program and erase cycles.\nTable 1.

DATA PROTECTION\nDuring power transition, there may be some false system level signals which result in inadvertent erasure or \nprogramming. The device is designed to protect itself from these accidental write cycles.\nThe state machine will be reset as standby mode automatically during power up. In addition, the control register \narchitecture of the device constrains that the memory contents can only be changed after specific command sequences have completed successfully. \nIn the following, there are several features to protect the system from the accidental write cycles during VCC power-\nup and power-down or from system noise.\n•  Valid command length checking: The command length will be checked whether it is at byte base and completed \non byte boundary.\n•  Write Enable (WREN) command: WREN command is required to set the Write Enable Latch bit (WEL) before \nother commands to change data. \n•   Deep Power Down Mode: By entering deep power down mode, the flash device also is under protected from \nwriting all commands except Release from deep power down mode command (RDP) and Read Electronic \nSignature command (RES), and softreset command.\n•   Advanced Security Features: there are some protection and security features which protect content from \ninadvertent write and hostile access.\n \n9\nRev. 1.7, April 15, 2021MX25L25673G\nP/N: PM2323 Macronix ProprietaryTable 2.

DEVICE OPERATION\n1. Before a command is issued, status register should be checked to ensure device is ready for the intended \noperation.\n2. When an incorrect command is written to this device, it enters standby mode and stays in standby mode until the \nnext CS# falling edge. In standby mode, This device\'s SO pin should be High-Z.\n3. When a correct command  is written to this device, it enters active mode and stays in active mode until the next \nCS# rising edge.\n4. Input data is latched on the rising edge of Serial Clock (SCLK) and data shifts out on the falling edge of SCLK. \nThe difference of Serial  mode 0 and mode 3 is shown as  "Figure 1. Serial Modes Supported" .\n5. For  the following instructions: RDID, RDSR, RDSCUR, READ/READ4B, FAST_READ/FAST_READ4B, \n2READ/2READ4B, DREAD/DREAD4B, 4READ/4READ4B, QREAD/QREAD4B, RDSFDP, RES, REMS, \nQPIID, RDDPB, RDSPB, RDLR, RDEAR, RDCR, the shifted-in instruction sequence is followed by a data-out sequence. After any bit of data being shifted out, the CS# can be high. For the following instructions: WREN, WRDI, WRSR, SE/SE4B, BE32K/BE32K4B, BE/BE4B, CE, PP/PP4B, 4PP/4PP4B, DP, ENSO, EXSO, WRSCUR, EN4B, EX4B, WPSEL, GBLK, GBULK, SUSPEND, RESUME, NOP, RSTEN, RST, EQIO, RSTQIO the CS# must go high exactly at the byte boundary; otherwise, the instruction will be rejected and not executed.\n6. While a W rite Status Register, Program, or Erase operation is in progress, access to the memory array is \nignored and will not affect the current operation of Write Status Register, Program, or Erase. \nFigure 1. Serial Modes Supported\nNote:CPOL indicates clock polarity of Serial master, CPOL=1 for SCLK high while idle, CPOL=0 for SCLK low while not transmitting. CPHA indicates clock phase.

For the \nmemory device of 256Mb and above, the 32bit address is requested for access higher memory size. The MX25L25673G provides three different methods to access the whole 256Mb density:\n(1)Command entry 4-byte address mode: Issue Enter 4-Byte mode command to set up the 4BYTE bit in \nConfiguration Register bit. After 4BYTE bit has been set, the number of address cycle become 32-bit. (2)Extended Address Register (EAR): configure the memory device into two 128Mb segments to select which one \nis active through the EAR bit “0”.(3)4-byte Address Command Set: When issuing 4-byte address command set, 4-byte address (A31-A0) is \nrequested after the instruction code. Please note that it is not necessary to issue EN4B command before issuing \nany of 4-byte command set.\nEnter 4-Byte Address Mode\nIn 4-byte Address mode, all instructions are 32-bits address clock cycles. By using EN4B and EX4B to enable and \ndisable the 4-byte address mode.\nWhen 4-byte address mode is enabled, the EAR<0> becomes "don\'t care" for all instructions requiring 4-byte \naddress. The EAR function will be disabled when 4-byte mode is enabled. \nWhen under EAR mode, Read, Program, Erase operates in the selected segment by using 3-byte address mode. \nFor the read operation, the whole array data can be continually read out with one command. Data output starts from \nthe selected top or bottom 128Mb, but it can cross the boundary.  When the last byte of the segment is reached, the next byte (in a continuous reading) is the first byte of the next segment. However, the EAR (Extended Address Register) value does not change. The random access reading can only be operated in the selected segment.\nThe Chip erase command will erase the whole chip and is not limited by EAR selected segment. Extended Address Register (Configurable)\nThe device provides an 8-bit volatile register for extended Address Register: it identifies the extended address (A31~A24) \nabove 128Mb density by using original 3-byte address.\nExtended Address Register (EAR)\nBit 7 Bit 6 Bit 5 Bit 4 Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0\nA31 A30 A29 A28 A27 A26 A25 A24\nFor the MX25L25673G the A31 to A25 are Don\'t Care. During EAR, reading these bits will read as 0. The bit 0 is default as "0".\nFigure 6.

Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) Read Mode\nQPI protocol enables user to take full advantage of Quad I/O Serial NOR Flash by providing the Quad I/O interface \nin command cycles, address cycles and as well as data output cycles.\nEnable QPI mode\nBy issuing command EQIO(35h), the QPI mode is enabled. After QPI mode is enabled, the device enters quad \nmode (4-4-4). \nFigure 7.

After the RSTQIO command is issued, the device \nreturns from QPI mode (4 I/O interface in command cycles) to SPI mode (1 I/O interface in command cycles). \nNote:\nFor EQIO and RSTQIO commands, CS# high width has to follow "From Write/Erase/Program to Read Status \nRegister" specification of tSHSL (defined in "Table 21. AC CHARACTERISTICS (Temperature = -40°C to 85°C, VCC = 2.7V \n- 3.6V)" ) for next instruction.\nFigure 8.

Release from Deep Power-down (RDP), Read Electronic Signature (RES)\nThe Release from Deep Power-down (RDP) instruction is completed by driving Chip Select (CS#) High. When Chip \nSelect (CS#) is driven High, the device is put in the Stand-by Power mode. If the device was not previously in the Deep Power-down mode, the transition to the Stand-by Power mode is immediate. If the device was previously in the Deep Power-down mode, though, the transition to the Stand-by Power mode is delayed by tRES1, and Chip Select (CS#) must remain High for at least tRES1(max), as specified in \n"Table 21.

The Write in Progress (WIP) bit, a volatile bit, indicates whether the device is busy in program/erase/write \nstatus register progress. When WIP bit sets to 1, which means the device is busy in program/erase/write status \nregister progress.  When WIP bit sets to 0, which means the device is not in progress of program/erase/write status register cycle.\nWEL bit. The Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is a volatile bit that is set to “1” by the WREN instruction. WEL needs to be\nset to “1” before the device can accept program and erase instructions, otherwise the program and erase instructions\nare ignored. WEL automatically clears to “0” when a program or erase operation completes. To ensure that both WIP\nand WEL are “0” and the device is ready for the next program or erase operation, it is recommended that WIP be\nconfirmed to be “0” before checking that WEL is also “0” (Please refer to "Figure 29. WRSR flow" ). If a program or\nerase instruction is applied to a protected memory area, the instruction will be ignored and WEL will clear to “0”.\nBP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 bits.  The Block Protect (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits, non-volatile bits, indicate the protected area \n(as defined in "Table 2. Protected Area Sizes" ) of the device to against the program/erase instruction without hardware \nprotection mode being set. To write the Block Protect (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits requires the Write Status Register (WRSR) \ninstruction to be executed. Those bits define the protected area of the memory to against Page Program (PP), Sector Erase (SE), Block Erase 32KB (BE32K), Block Erase (BE) and Chip Erase (CE) instructions (only if Block Protect bits (BP3:BP0) set to 0, the CE instruction can be executed). The BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 bits are "0" as default. Which is un-protected.\nQE bit.  The Quad Enable (QE) bit is permanently set to "1". When QE is "1", Quad mode is enabled and Quad mode \ncommands are supported along with Single and Dual mode commands.\n35\nRev. 1.7, April 15, 2021MX25L25673G\nP/N: PM2323 Macronix ProprietaryConfiguration Register\nThe Configuration Register is able to change the default status of Flash memory. Flash memory will be configured \nafter the CR bit is set. \nODS bit \nThe output driver strength (ODS1, ODS0) bits are volatile bits, which indicate the output driver level (as defined in "Table 9. \nOutput Driver Strength Table" ) of the device. The Output Driver Strength is defaulted as 30 Ohms when delivered from \nfactory. To write the ODS bits requires the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction to be executed.\nTB bit\nThe Top/Bottom (TB) bit is a non-volatile OTP bit. The Top/Bottom (TB) bit is used to configure the Block Protect \narea by BP bit (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0), starting from TOP or Bottom of the memory array. The TB bit is defaulted as “0”, which means Top area protect. When it is set as “1”, the protect area will change to Bottom area of the memory device.  To write the TB bits requires the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction to be executed.\nPBE bit\nThe Preamble Bit Enable (PBE) bit is a volatile bit. It is used to enable or disable the preamble bit data pattern \noutput on dummy cycles. The PBE bit is defaulted as “0”, which means preamble bit is disabled. When it is set as “1”, the preamble bit will be enabled, and inputted into dummy cycles. To write the PBE bits requires the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction to be executed.\n4BYTE Indicator bit\nBy writing EN4B instruction, the 4BYTE bit may be set as "1" to access the address length of 32-bit for memory area \nof higher density (large than 128Mb). The default state is "0" as the 24-bit address mode. The 4BYTE bit may be cleared by power-off or writing EX4B instruction to reset the state to be "0".\nTable 8.

Write Status Register (WRSR)\nThe WRSR instruction is for changing the values of Status Register Bits and Configuration Register Bits. Before \nsending WRSR instruction, the Write Enable (WREN) instruction must be decoded and executed to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in advance. The WRSR instruction can change the value of Block Protect (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits to define the protected area of memory (as shown in \nTable 2 ), but has no effect on bit1(WEL) and bit0 (WIP) \nof the status register.\nThe sequence of issuing WRSR instruction is: CS# goes low→ send WRSR instruction code→ Status Register data \non SI→Configuration Register data on SI→CS# goes high. \nBoth SPI (8 clocks) and QPI (2 clocks) commands cycle can be accepted by this instruction. The SIO[3:1] are don\'t \ncare during SPI mode.\nThe CS# must go high exactly at the 8 bits or 16 bits data boundary; otherwise, the instruction will be rejected and \nnot executed. The self-timed Write Status Register cycle time (tW) is initiated as soon as Chip Select (CS#) goes high. The Write in Progress (WIP) bit still can be check out during the Write Status Register cycle is in progress.  The WIP sets 1 during the tW timing, and sets 0 when Write Status Register Cycle is completed, and the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset.\n38\nRev. 1.7, April 15, 2021MX25L25673G\nP/N: PM2323 Macronix ProprietaryTable 11.

Enter 4-byte mode (EN4B)\nThe EN4B instruction enables accessing the address length of 32-bit for the memory area of higher density (larger \nthan 128Mb).  The device default is in 24-bit address mode; after sending out the EN4B instruction, the bit5 (4BYTE bit) of Configuration Register will be automatically set to "1" to indicate the 4-byte address mode has been enabled. Once the 4-byte address mode is enabled, the address length becomes 32-bit instead of the default 24-bit.  There are three methods to exit the 4-byte mode: writing exit 4-byte mode (EX4B) instruction, Reset or power-of f.  \nAll instructions are accepted normally, and just the address bit is changed from 24-bit to 32-bit.\nThe following commands don\'t support 4-byte address: RDSFDP, RES and REMS.The sequence of issuing EN4B instruction is: CS# goes low → send EN4B instruction to enter 4-byte mode (automatically \nset 4BYTE bit as "1") → CS# goes high.\n9-12.  Exit 4-byte mode (EX4B)\nThe EX4B instruction is executed to exit the 4-byte address mode and return to the default 3-bytes address mode.  After sending out the EX4B instruction, the bit5 (4BYTE bit) of Configuration Register will be cleared to be "0" to indicate the exit of the 4-byte address mode. Once exiting the 4-byte address mode, the address length will return to 24-bit. \nThe sequence of issuing EX4B instruction is: CS# goes low → send EX4B instruction to exit 4-byte mode (automatically \nclear the 4BYTE bit to be "0") → CS# goes high.\n41\nRev. 1.7, April 15, 2021MX25L25673G\nP/N: PM2323 Macronix Proprietary9-13.

A Quad Enable (QE) bit of status Register must be set to "1" before sending the 4DTRD instruction.

The 8-bit address can be latched-in at one clock, and 8-bit data can be read out at one clock, which means four bits at rising edge of clock, the other four bits at falling edge of clock. The first address byte can be at any location. The address is automatically increased to the next higher address after each byte data is shifted out, so the whole memory can be read out at a single 4DTRD instruction.

Once the CR<4> is set, the preamble bit is inputted into dummy cycles. \nEnabling preamble bit will not affect the function of enhance mode bit. In Dummy cycles, performance enhance \nmode bit still operates with the same function. Preamble bit will output after performance enhance mode bit.\nThe preamble bit is a fixed 8-bit data pattern (00110100). While dummy cycle number reaches 10, the complete \n8 bits will start to output right after the performance enhance mode bit. While dummy cycle is not sufficient of 10 cycles, the rest of the preamble bits will be cut. For example, 8 dummy cycles will cause 6 preamble bits to output, and 6 dummy cycles will cause 4 preamble bits to output.\n52\nRev. 1.7, April 15, 2021MX25L25673G\nP/N: PM2323 Macronix ProprietaryFigure 41.

Burst Read\nThe Burst Read feature allows applications to fill a cache line with a fixed length of data without using multiple readcommands. Burst Read is disabled by default at power-up or reset. Burst Read is enabled by setting the BurstLength. When the Burst Length is set, reads will wrap on the selected boundary (8/16/32/64-bytes) containing theinitial target address. For example if an 8-byte Wrap Depth is selected, reads will wrap on the 8-byte-page-alignedboundary containing the initial read address.\nTo set the Burst Length, drive CS# low → send SET BURST LENGTH instruction code (C0h) → send WRAP CODE \n→drive CS# high.

Performance Enhance Mode - XIP (execute-in-place)\nThe device could waive the command cycle bits if the two cycle bits after address cycle toggles. \nPerformance enhance mode is supported in both SPI and QPI mode.In QPI mode, “EBh” "ECh" "EDh" "EEh" and SPI “EBh” "ECh" "EDh" "EEh" commands support enhance mode. The \nperformance enhance mode is not supported in dual I/O mode.\nTo enter performance-enhancing mode, P[7:4] must be toggling with P[3:0]; likewise P[7:0]=A5h, 5Ah, F0h or 0Fh \ncan make this mode continue and skip the next 4READ instruction. To leave enhance mode, P[7:4] is no longer toggling with P[3:0]; likewise P[7:0]=FFh, 00h, AAh or 55h along with CS# is afterwards raised and then lowered. Issuing ”FFh” data cycle can also exit enhance mode. The system then will leave performance enhance mode and return to normal operation.\nTo conduct the Performance Enhance Mode Reset operation in SPI mode, FFh data cycle(8 clocks in 3-byte \naddress mode)/3FFh data cycle(10 clocks in 4-byte address mode), should be issued in 1I/O sequence. In QPI Mode, FFFFFFFFh data cycle(8 clocks in 3-byte address mode)/FFFFFFFFFFh data cycle (10 clocks in 4-byte address mode), in 4I/O should be issued. If the system controller is being Reset during operation, the flash device will return to the standard SPI operation.\nAfter entering enhance mode, following CS# go high, the device will stay in the read mode and treat CS# go low of \nthe first clock as address instead of command cycle.\nAnother sequence of issuing 4READ instruction especially useful in random access is: CS# goes low →send 4READ \ninstruction →3-bytes or 4-bytes address interleave on SIO3, SIO2, SIO1 & SIO0 →performance enhance toggling \nbit P[7:0] → 4 dummy cycles (Default) →data out until CS# goes high → CS# goes low (The following 4READ \ninstruction is not allowed, hence 8 cycles of 4READ can be saved comparing to normal 4READ mode) → 3-bytes or \n4-bytes random access address.\n60\nRev. 1.7, April 15, 2021MX25L25673G\nP/N: PM2323 Macronix ProprietaryFigure 54. 4 x I/O Read enhance performance Mode Sequence (SPI Mode) \n2 1345678 0\nSCLK\nSIO0\nSIO1CS#\n9 12 10 11 13 14\nEBh15 16\nn+1 ........... ...... ........... ........... n+7 n+9 n+1317 18 19 20 21 22 n\nSIO2\nSIO3\nSIO0\nSIO1\nSIO2SIO3Performance\nenhance \nindicator (Note 1)\nSCLKCS#\nPerformance\nenhance \nindicator (Note 1)Mode 3\nMode 0\nA21 A17 A13 A9 A5 A1A8 A4 A\x11 A20 A16 A12\nA23 A19 A15 A11 A7 A3A10 A6 A2 A22 A18 A14P4 P0\nP5 P1\nP6 P2\nP7 P3\nA21 A17 A13 A9 A5 A1A8 A4 A\x11 A20 A16 A12\nA23 A19 A15 A11 A7 A3A10 A6 A2 A22 A18 A14P4 P0\nP5 P1\nP6 P2\nP7 P3Command\nConfigurable \nDummy Cycle (Note 2)6 ADD Cycles\n(Note 3)\n6 ADD Cycles\n(Note 3)D4 D0\nD5 D1Data \nOut 1Data \nOut 2Data \nOut n\nD4 D0\nD5 D1D4 D0\nD5 D1\nD6 D2\nD7 D3D6 D2\nD7 D3D6 D2\nD7 D3\nD4 D0\nD5 D1Data \nOut 1Data \nOut 2Data \nOut n\nD4 D0\nD5 D1D4 D0\nD5 D1\nD6 D2\nD7 D3D6 D2\nD7 D3D6 D2\nD7 D3Mode 3\nMode 0\nConfigurable \nDummy Cycle (Note 2)\nNotes: \n1.

Write Protection Selection (WPSEL)\nThere are two write protection methods provided on this device, (1) Block Protection (BP) mode or (2) Individual \nSector Protection mode. The protection modes are mutually exclusive. The WPSEL bit selects which protection mode is enabled. If WPSEL=0 (factory default), BP mode is enabled and Individual Sector Protection mode is disabled. If WPSEL=1, Individual Sector Protection mode is enabled and BP mode is disabled. The WPSEL command is used to set WPSEL=1. A WREN command must be executed to set the WEL bit before sending the WPSEL command. Please note that the WPSEL bit is an OTP bit. Once WPSEL is set to “1”, it cannot be programmed back to “0”. \nWhen WPSEL = 0: Block Lock (BP) protection mode, \nThe memory array is write protected by the BP3 to BP0 bits.\nWhen WPSEL =1: Individual Sector protection mode,\nBlocks are individually protected by their own SPB or DPB. On power-up, all blocks are write protected by the Dynamic Protection Bits (DPB) by default. The Individual Sector Protection instructions WRLR, RDLR, WRSPB, ESSPB, WRDPB, RDDPB, GBLK, and GBULK are activated. The BP3 to BP0 bits of the Status Register are disabled and have no effect. \nThe sequence of issuing WPSEL instruction is: CS# goes low → send WPSEL instruction to enable the Individual \nSector Protect mode → CS# goes high.\nWrite Protection Selection \nStart\n(Default in BP Mode)\nSet\nWPSEL BitWPSEL=0 WPSEL=1\nBlock Protection\n(BP)Individual \nSector Protection\n75\nRev. 1.7, April 15, 2021MX25L25673G\nP/N: PM2323 Macronix ProprietaryFigure 73.

Lock Register\nThe Lock Register is a 16-bit one-time programmable register. Lock Register bit [6] is SPB Lock Down Bit (SPBLKDN) \nwhich is an unique bit assigned to control all SPB bit status.\nWhen SPBLKDN is 1, SPB can be changed. When it is locked as 0, all SPB can not be changed anymore, and \nSPBLKDN bit itself can not be altered anymore, either. \nThe Lock Register is programmed using the WRLR (Write Lock Register) command. A WREN command must be \nexecuted to set the WEL bit before sending the WRLR command.  \nTable 13.

Solid Protection Bits\nThe Solid Protection Bits (SPBs) are nonvolatile bits for enabling or disabling write-protection to sectors and blocks. \nThe SPB bits have the same endurance as the Flash memory. An SPB is assigned to each 4KB sector in the bottom and top 64KB of memory and to each 64KB block in the remaining memory. The factory default state of the SPB bits is “0”, which has the sector/block write-protection disabled.\nWhen an SPB is set to “1”, the associated sector or block is write-protected. Program and erase operations on the \nsector or block will be inhibited. SPBs can be individually set to “1” by the WRSPB command. However, the SPBs cannot be individually cleared to “0”. Issuing the ESSPB command clears all SPBs to “0”. A WREN command must be executed to set the WEL bit before sending the WRSPB or ESSPB command.\nThe RDSPB command reads the status of the SPB of a sector or block.  The RDSPB command returns 00h if the \nSPB is “0”, indicating write-protection is disabled. The RDSPB command returns FFh if the SPB is “1”, indicating write-protection is enabled. \nNote:  If SPBLKDN=0, commands to set or clear the SPB bits will be ignored.\nTable 14.

Dynamic Protection Bits\nThe Dynamic Protection Bits (DPBs) are volatile bits for quickly and easily enabling or disabling write-protection \nto sectors and blocks. A DPB is assigned to each 4KB sector in the bottom and top 64KB of memory and to each 64KB block in the rest of the memory. The DBPs can enable write-protection on a sector or block regardless of the state of the corresponding SPB. However, the DPB bits can only unprotect sectors or blocks whose SPB bits are “0” (unprotected).\nWhen a DPB is “1”, the associated sector or block will be write-protected, preventing any program or erase \noperation on the sector or block. All DPBs default to “1” after power-on or reset. When a DPB is cleared to “0”, the associated sector or block will be unprotected if the corresponding SPB is also “0”.  \nDPB bits can be individually set to “1” or “0” by the WRDPB command. The DBP bits can also be globally cleared to \n“0” with the GBULK command or globally set to “1” with the GBLK command. A WREN command must be executed to set the WEL bit before sending the WRDPB, GBULK, or GBLK command.\nThe RDDPB command reads the status of the DPB of a sector or block. The RDDPB command returns 00h if the \nDPB is “0”, indicating write-protection is disabled. The RDDPB command returns FFh if the DPB is “1”, indicating write-protection is enabled. \nTable 15.

Program/Erase Suspend/Resume\nThe device allow the interruption of Sector-Erase, Block-Erase or Page-Program operations and conduct other \noperations.\nAfter issue suspend command, the system can determine if the device has entered the Erase-Suspended mode \nthrough Bit2 (PSB) and Bit3 (ESB) of security register. (please refer to "Table 12. Security Register Definition" )\nBoth SPI (8 clocks) and QPI (2 clocks) command cycles can be accepted by this instruction. The SIO[3:1] are don\'t care during SPI mode.\n9-38.  Erase Suspend\nErase suspend allow the interruption of all erase operations. After the device has entered Erase-Suspended mode, the system can read any sector(s) or Block(s) except those being erased by the suspended erase operation. Reading the sector or Block being erase suspended is invalid. \nAfter erase suspend, WEL bit will be clear, only read related, resume and reset command can be accepted, \nincluding: 03h, 0Bh, 3Bh, 6Bh, BBh, EBh, 5Ah, C0h, 06h, 04h, 2Bh, 9Fh, AFh, 05h, ABh, 90h, B1h, C1h, B0h, 30h, 66h, 99h, 00h, 35h, F5h, 15h, 2Dh, E2h, E0h.\nIf the system issues an Erase Suspend command after the sector erase operation has already begun, the device \nwill not enter Erase-Suspended  mode until tESL time has elapsed.\nErase Suspend Bit (ESB) indicates the status of Erase Suspend operation. Users may use ESB to identify the state \nof flash memory. After the flash memory is suspended by Erase Suspend command, ESB is set to "1".  ESB is cleared to "0" after erase operation resumes.\n9-39.  Program Suspend\nProgram suspend allows the interruption of all program operations. After the device has entered Program-\nSuspended mode, the system can read any sector(s) or Block(s) except those be  ing programmed by the suspended  \nprogram operation. Reading the sector or Block being program suspended is invalid. \nAfter program suspend, WEL bit will be cleared, only read related, resume and reset command can be accepted, \nincluding: 03h, 0Bh, 3Bh, 6Bh, BBh, EBh, 5Ah, C0h, 06h, 04h, 2Bh, 9Fh, AFh, 05h, ABh, 90h, B1h, C1h, B0h, 30h, 66h, 99h, 00h, 35h, F5h, 15h, 2Dh, E2h, E0h.\nProgram Suspend Bit (PSB) indicates the status of Program Suspend operation.

Write-Resume\nThe Write operation is being resumed when Write-Resume instruction issued. ESB or PSB (suspend status bit) in \nStatus register will be changed back to “0”.\nThe operation of Write-Resume is as follows: CS# drives low → send write resume command cycle (30h) → drive \nCS# high. By polling Busy Bit in status register, the internal write operation status could be checked to be completed or not. The user may also wait the time lag of TSE, TBE, TPP for Sector-erase, Block-erase or Page-programming. WREN (command "06h") is not required to issue before resume. Resume to another suspend operation requires latency time of tPRS or tERS, as defined in \n"Table 21. AC CHARACTERISTICS (Temperature = -40°C to 85°C, VCC = 2.7V \n- 3.6V)" . \nPlease note that, if "performance enhance mode" is executed during suspend operation, the device can not be resumed. To restart the write command, disable the "performance enhance mode" is required. After the "performance enhance mode" is disabled, the write-resume command is effective.\n9-41.  No Operation (NOP)\nThe “No Operation” command is only able to terminate the Reset Enable (RSTEN) command and will not affect any other command. \nBoth SPI (8 clocks) and QPI (2 clocks) command cycles can be accepted by this instruction. The SIO[3:1] are don\'t \ncare during SPI mode.\n9-42.  Software Reset (Reset-Enable (RSTEN) and Reset (RST))\nThe Software Reset operation combines two instructions: Reset-Enable (RSTEN) command and Reset (RST) command. It returns the device to standby mode. All the volatile bits and settings will be cleared then, which makes the device return to the default status as power on.\nTo execute Reset command (RST), the Reset-Enable (RSTEN) command must be executed first to perform the \nReset operation. If there is any other command to interrupt after the Reset-Enable command, the Reset-Enable will be invalid.\nBoth SPI (8 clocks) and QPI (2 clocks) command cycles can be accepted by this instruction. The SIO[3:1] are don\'t \ncare during SPI mode.\nIf the Reset command is executed during program or erase operation, the operation will be disabled, the data under \nprocessing could be damaged or lost.\nThe reset time is different depending on the last operation.

POWER-ON STATE\nThe device is in the states below when power-up:\n - Standby mode (please n ote it is not deep power-down mode)\n - W rite Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset\nThe device must not be selected during power-up and power-down stage unless the VCC achieves below correct \nlevel:\n - VCC minimum at power- up stage and then after a delay of tVSL\n - GND at power-down\nPlease note that a pull-up resistor on CS# may ensure a safe and proper power-up/down level.\nAn internal power-on reset (POR) circuit may protect the device from data corruption and inadvertent data change \nduring power up state. When VCC is lower than VWI (POR threshold voltage value), the internal logic is reset and the flash device has no response to any command.\nFor further protection on the device, if the VCC does not reach the VCC minimum level, the correct operation is not \nguaranteed. The write, erase, and program command should be sent after the below time delay:\n - tVSL  after VCC reached VCC minimum level\nThe device can accept read command after VCC reached VCC minimum and a time delay of tVSL.Please refer to the \n"Figure 97. Power-up Timing" .\nNote:\n -  To stabilize the VCC level, the VCC rail decoupled by a suitable capacitor close to package pins is \nrecommended. (generally around 0.1uF)\n - At power-down stage, the VCC drops below VWI level, all operations are disable and device has no response \nto any command. The data corruption might occur during the stage while a write, program, erase cycle is in progress.\n89\nRev. 1.7, April 15, 2021MX25L25673G\nP/N: PM2323 Macronix Proprietary12.
