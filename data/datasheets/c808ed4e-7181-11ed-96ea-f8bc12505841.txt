REVISION HISTORY  ................................ ................................ ................................ ....................  100 \n \nW25Q128JV -DTR \n \n \n 1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION S \nThe W25Q128JV  (128M -bit) Serial Flash memory provides a storage solution for systems with limited \nspace, pins and power. The 25Q series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash \ndevices. They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM,  executing code directly from D ual/Quad SPI  (XIP)  \nand storing voice, text and data. The device operates on a single 2.7V to 3.6V power supply with current \nconsumption as low as 1µA for power -down. All devices are offered in space -saving packages.  \nThe W25Q128JV  array is or ganized into 65,536 programmable pages of 256 -bytes each. Up to 256 bytes \ncan be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in groups of 16 (4KB sector erase), groups of 128 \n(32KB block erase), groups of 256 (64KB block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase ). The W25Q128JV  \nhas 4,096 erasable sectors and 256 erasable blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for greater \nflexibility in applications that require data and parameter storage. (See Figure 2.)  \nThe W25Q 128JV support the standard Serial Periph eral Interface (SPI), Dual/Quad I/O SPI Quad \nPeripheral Interface (QPI)  as well as Double Transfer Rate(DTR)  : Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data \nI/O0 (DI), I/O1 (DO), I/O2 (/WP), and I/O3 (/HOLD). SPI clock frequencies of up to 133MHz  are supported \nallowing equivalent clock rates of 266MHz  (133MHz  x 2) for Dual I/O and 532MHz  (133MHz  x 4) for Quad \nI/O when using the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O and QPI instructions. These 3transfer rates can outperform \nstandard Asynchronous 8 and 16 -bit Parallel Flash memor ies. The Continuous Read Mode allows for \nefficient memory access with as few as 8 -clocks of instruction -overhead to read a 24 -bit address, allowing \ntrue XIP (execute in place) operation.  \nA Hold pin, Write Protect pin and programmable write protect ion, with top or bottom array control,  provide \nfurther control flexibility. Additionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device ID, a \n64-bit Unique Serial Number and three 256 -bytes Security Registers.  \n2.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \n4.1 Chip Select (/CS)  \nThe SPI Chip Select (/CS) pin enables and disables device operation. When /CS  is high the device is \ndeselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3) pins are at high impedance. When \ndeselected, the devices power consumption will be at standby levels unless an inter nal erase, program or \nwrite status register cycle is in progress. When /CS  is brought low the device will be selected, power \nconsumption will increase to active levels and instructions can be written to and data read from the device. \nAfter power -up, /CS  must transition from high to low before a new instruction will be accepted. The /CS \ninput must track the VCC supply level at power -up and power -down (see “Write Protection” and Figure \n58). If needed a pull -up resister on the /CS pin can be used to accomplish  this. \n4.2 Serial Data Input, Output and IOs (DI, DO and IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3)   \nThe W25 Q128JV  supports standard SPI, Dual SPI and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI instructions \nuse the unidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or dat a to the device on the \nrising edge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidirectional DO (output) to \nread data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \nDual and Quad SPI instructions use the bidirectional IO pins t o serially write instructions, addresses or \ndata to the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the device on the falling edge of \nCLK. Quad SPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set.   \nWhen QE=1, the /WP pin becomes IO2 and /HOLD pin becomes IO3.  \n4.3 Write Protect (/WP)  \nThe Write Protect (/WP) pin can be used to prevent the Status Register from being written. Used in \nconjunction with the Status Register’s Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2,  BP1 and BP0) bits and Status \nRegister Protect (SRP) bits, a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire memory array can be \nhardware protected. The /WP pin is active low. When the QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, \nthe /WP pin function is  not available since this pin is used for IO2. See Figure 1a -c for the pin \nconfiguration of Quad I/O operation.  \n4.4 HOLD (/HOLD)  \nThe /HOLD pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. When /HOLD is brought low, \nwhile /CS  is low, the DO pin  will be at high impedance and signals on the DI and CLK pins will be ignored \n(don’t care). When /HOLD is brought high, device operation can resume. The  /HOLD  function can be \nuseful when multiple devices are sharing the same SPI signals. The /HOLD pin is a ctive low. When the \nQE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, the /HOLD pin function is not available since this pin is \nused for IO3. See Figure 1a -e for the pin configuration of Quad I/O operation.  \n4.5 Serial Clock (CLK)  \nThe SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK ) pin provides the timing for serial input and output operations. ("See SPI \nOperations")  \n4.6 Reset (/RESET)  \nThe /RESET pin allows the device to be reset by the controller. For 8 -pin packages, when QE=0, the IO3 \npin can be configured either as a /HOLD pin or as  a /RESET pin depending on Status Register setting. \nWhen QE=1, the /HOLD or /RESET function is not available for 8 -pin configuration. On the 16 -pin SOIC \nand TFBGA package, a dedicated /RESET pin is provided and it is independent of QE bit setting.  \nW25Q128JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date: March 27 , 2018  \n - 10 -                                -Revision C  5.

W25 Q128JV  Serial Flash Memory Operation Diagram  \n \n6.1.1  Standar d SPI Instructions  \nThe W25 Q128JV  is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial Clock \n(CLK), Chip Select ( /CS), Serial Data Input  (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard SPI instructions \nuse the DI input pin to serially wri te instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of \nCLK. The  DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on the falling edge  of CLK.  \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference betwe en Mode 0 and \nMode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and data is \nnot being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0 , the CLK signal is normally low  on the falling and \nrising edges of /CS.  For Mode 3 , the CLK signal is normally high  on the falling and rising edges of /CS .  \n6.1.2  Dual SPI Instructions  \nThe W25 Q128JV  support s Dual SPI operation when using instructions such as  “Fast Read Dual Output  \n(3Bh)”  and “Fast Read Dual I/O  (BBh) ”. These instructions  allow da ta to be transferred to or from the \ndevice  at two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices.  The Dual SPI Read instruction s are \nideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -shadowing) or for execut ing non-speed -\ncritical  code  directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Dual SPI instructions , the DI and DO pins \nbecome bidirectional I/ O pins:  IO0 and IO1.  \nW25Q128JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date: March 27 , 2018  \n - 12 -                                -Revision C  6.1.3  Quad SPI Instructions  \nThe W25 Q128JV  supports Quad  SPI operation whe n using instructions such as  “Fast Read Quad  Output  \n(6Bh) ”, and “Fast Read  Quad  I/O (EBh) ”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the \ndevice four to six times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash. The Quad Read instructions offer a significant \nimprovement in continuous  and random access transfer  rates allowing fast code -shadowing to RAM or \nexecution directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Quad SPI instructions the DI and DO pins become \nbidirectional IO0 and IO1 , and the /WP and /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO3 respectively. Quad SPI \ninstructions  require the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set . \n6.1.4  QPI Instructions  \nThe W25 Q128JV  supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) operations  only when the device is switched \nfrom Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using the “ Enter  QPI (38h)” instruction.  The typical SPI \nprotocol requires that the byte-long instruction code being shifted into the device only via DI pin in eight \nserial clocks. The QPI mode utilizes all four IO pins to input the instruction code, thus only two serial \nclocks are required. This can significantly reduce the SPI instruction overhead and improve system \nperformance in an XIP environment. Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode and QPI mode are exclusive. Only \none mode can be active at any given time. “ Enter QPI  (38h)” a nd “Exit QPI  (FFh)” instructions are used to \nswitch between these two modes. Upon power -up or after a software reset using “Reset (99h)” instruction , \nthe default state of the device is  Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode.  To enable QPI mode, the non -volatile \nQuad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 is required to be set.  When using QPI instructions, the DI and \nDO pins become bidirectional IO0 and IO1, and the /WP and /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO3 \nrespectively.  See Figure 3 for the device operation modes.  \n6.1.5  SPI / QPI  DTR Read Instructions  \nTo effectively improve the read operation throughput without increasing the serial clock frequency, \nW25 Q128JV  introduces multiple DTR (Double Transfer Rate) Read instructions that support \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI and QPI modes. The by te-long instruction code is still latched into the device on \nthe rising edge of the serial clock similar to all other SPI/QPI instructions. Once a DTR instruction code is \naccepted by the device, the address input and data output will be latched on both ris ing and falling edges \nof the serial clock.  \n6.1.6  Hold Function  \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI operations, t he /HOLD  signal allows the W25 Q128JV  operation to be \npaused while it is actively selected (when /CS is low). The  /HOLD  function may be useful in cases where  \nthe SPI data and clock signals are shared with other devices. For example, consider if the page buffer \nwas only partially written when a priority interrupt requires use of the SPI bus. In this case the  /HOLD  \nfunction can save the state of the instruction and the data in the buffer so programming can resume where \nit left off once the bus is available again.  The /HOLD function is only available for standard SPI and Dual \nSPI operation, not during Quad SPI  or QPI . The Quad Enable Bit QE in Status Register -2 is used to \ndetermine if the pin is used as /HOLD pin or data I/O pin. When QE=0 (factory default), the pin is /HOLD, \nwhen QE=1, the pin will become an I/O pin, /HOLD function is no longer available.  \nTo initiate a  /HOLD  condition, the device must be selected with /CS low. A  /HOLD  condition will activate on \nthe falling edge of the /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not already low the  \n/HOLD  condition will activate after the next falling edge of CLK. The  /HOLD  condition will terminate o n the \nrising edge of the  /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not already low the  /HOLD  \ncondition will terminate after the next falling edge of CLK.  During a  /HOLD  condition, the Serial Data \nOutput (DO) is high impedance, a nd Serial  Data Input (DI ) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored. The Chip \nW25Q128JV -DTR \n \n \n Select ( /CS) signal should be kept active (low) for the full duration of the  /HOLD  operation to avoid \nresetting the internal logic state of the device.  \n \n6.1.7  Software Reset & Hardware /RESET pin  \nThe W25 Q128JV  can be reset to the initial power -on state by a software Reset sequence, either in SPI \nmode or QPI mode. This sequence must include two consecutive commands: Enable Reset (66h) & \nReset (99h). If the command sequence is successfully accepted, the device will take approximately 30uS \n(tRST) to reset. No command will be accepted during the reset period.  \nFor the WSON -8 and TFBGA package types, W25 Q128JV  can also be configured to utilize a hardware \n/RESET pin. The HOLD/RST bit in the Status Register -3 is the configuration bit for /HOLD pin function or \nRESET pin function. When HOLD/RST=0 (factory default), the pin acts as a /HOLD pin as described \nabove; when HOLD/RST=1, the pin acts as a /RESET pin. Drive the /RESET pin low for a minimum period \nof ~1us (t RESET*) will reset the device to its initial power -on state. Any on -going Program/Erase operation \nwill be interrupted and data corruption may happen. While /RESET is low, the device will not accept any \ncommand input.  \nIf QE bit is set to 1, the /HOLD or /RE SET function will be disabled, the pin will become one of the four \ndata I/O pins.  \n \nFor the SOIC -16 package, W25 Q128JV  provides a dedicated /RESET pin in addition to the /HOLD (IO 3) \npin as illustrated in Figure 1b. Drive the /RESET pin low for a minimum per iod of ~1us (tRESET*) will reset \nthe device to its initial power -on state. The HOLD/RST bit or QE bit in the Status Register will not affect \nthe function of this dedicated /RESET pin.  \n \nHardware /RESET pin has the highest priority among all the input signal s. Drive /RESET low for a \nminimum period of ~1us (tRESET*) will interrupt any on -going external/internal operations, regardless the \nstatus of other SPI signals (/CS, CLK, IOs, /WP and/or /HOLD).  \n \nNote:  \n1. While a faster /RESET pulse (as short as a few hundre d nanoseconds) will often reset the device, a 1us minimum is \nrecommended to ensure reliable operation.  \n2. There is an internal pull -up resistor for the dedicated /RESET pin on the SOIC -16 package. If the reset function is not needed, \nthis pin can be left floa ting in the system . \n \n \nW25Q128JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date: March 27 , 2018  \n - 14 -                                -Revision C  6.2 Write Protection  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise and other \nadverse system conditions that may compromise data integrity. To address this concern , the W25 Q128JV  \nprovides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n6.2.1  Write Protect Features  \n\uf0b7 Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n\uf0b7 Time delay write disable after Power -up \n\uf0b7 Write enable/disable instructions  and a utomatic write disable after e rase or program  \n\uf0b7 Softwar e and Hardware (/WP pin) write p rotection using Status Registers  \n\uf0b7 Additional Individual Block/Sector Locks for array protection  \n\uf0b7 Write Protection using Power -down instruction   \n\uf0b7 Lock Down write protection for Status Register until the next power -up \n\uf0b7 One Time Pr ogram (OTP) write protection for array and Security Register s using Status Register* \n* Note : This feature  is available upon special flow. Please contact Winbond for details.  \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down , the W25 Q128JV  will maintain a reset condition whi le VCC is below the \nthreshold value of V WI, (See Power -up Timing and Voltage Levels and Figure 43). While reset, all \noperations are disabled and no instructions are recognized. During power -up and after the VCC voltage \nexceeds V WI, all program and erase re lated instructions are further disabled for a time delay of t PUW. This \nincludes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase and the Write Status \nRegister instructions. Note that the chip select pin ( /CS) must track the VCC supply level at power -up until \nthe VCC -min level and t VSL time delay is reached , and it must also track the VCC supply level at power -\ndown to prevent adverse command sequence. If needed a pull -up resister on /CS can be used to \naccomplish this .  \nAfter power -up the  device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Status Register Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Write Enable instruction must be issued before a Page Program, Sector \nErase, Block Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruct ion will be accepted. After completing a \nprogram, erase or write instruction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is automatically cleared to a write -\ndisabled state of 0.  \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instructi on and setting the \nStatus Register Protect (SRP , SRL) and Block Protect ( CMP , SEC, TB, BP[2:0]) bits. These settings  allow \na portion or the entire  memory  array  to be configured as read only. Used in conjunction with the Write \nProtect ( /WP) pin, changes to the Status Register can be enabled or disabled under hardware control. See \nStatus Register section for further information.  Additionally, the Power -down instruction offers an extra \nlevel of write protection as all instructions are ignored except for the Re lease Power -down instruction.  \nThe W25 Q128JV  also provides another Write Protect method using the Individual Block Locks.  Each \n64KB block  (except the top and bot tom blocks , total of 254 blocks ) and each 4KB sector  within the \ntop/bottom blocks (total of 32 s ectors) are equipped with an Individual Block Lock bit. When the lock bit is \n0, the corresponding sector or block can be erased or programmed; when the lock bit is set to 1, Erase or \nProgram commands issued to the corresponding sector or block will be igno red. When the device is \npowered on, all Individual Block Lock bits will be 1, so the entire memory array is protected  from \nErase/Program. An “Individual Block Unl ock (39h)” instruction must be issued to unlock any specific sector \nor block.  \nThe WPS bit in S tatus Register -3 is used to decide which Write Protect scheme should be used. When \nWPS=0 (factory default), the device  will only utilize CMP, SEC, TB, BP[2 :0] bits to protect specific areas of \nthe arra y; when WPS=1, the device will utilize the Individual B lock Locks for write protection.  \nW25Q128JV -DTR \n \n \n 7. STATUS  AND CONFIGURATION  REGISTERS  \nThree Status and Configuration Registers are provided for W25 Q128JV . The Read Status Register -1/2/3 \ninstructions can be used to provide status on the availability of the flash memory arra y, whether the device \nis write enabled or disabled, the state of write protection, Quad SPI setting, Security Register lock status,  \nErase/Program Suspend status, output driver strength,  and power -up. The Write Status Register \ninstruction can be used to co nfigure the device write protection features, Quad SPI setting,  Security \nRegister OTP locks, Hold/Reset functions, and output driver strength. Write access to the Status Register is \ncontrolled by the state of the  non-volatile Status Register Protect bits (SRP, SRL ), the Write Enable \ninstruction, and during Standard/Dual SPI operations, the /WP pin.  \n7.1 Status Registers  \n \nSRP SE C TB BP2BP1BP0WEL BUS Y\nTOP/BOTTOM PROTECT\nWRITE E NABLE LATCH\n S7 S6 S5 S4 S3 S2 S1 S0\nSE CTOR PROTECT\nBLOCK PROTECT B ITS\nERA SE /WRITE IN P ROGRESS(Volatile /Non-Volatile Writable )\n(Status -Only)\n(Status -Only)(Volatile /Non-Volatile Writable )\n(Volatile /Non-Volatile Writable )\n \nFigure 4 a. Status Register -1 \n7.1.1  Erase/Write In Progress (BUSY) – Status Only   \nBUSY is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set  to a 1 state when the device is executing a \nPage Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register or \nErase/Program Security Register instruction. During this time the device will ignore further instructions \nexcept f or the Read Status Register and Erase/Program Suspend instruction (see t W, tPP, tSE, tBE, and \ntCE in AC Characteristics). When the program, erase or write status/security register instruction has \ncompleted, the BUSY bit will be cleared to a 0 state indicat ing the device is ready for further instructions.   \n7.1.2  Write Enable Latch (WEL) – Status Only  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the status register (S1) that is set to 1 after executing a \nWrite Enable Instruction. The WEL status bit is cleared to 0 when the device is write disabled. A write \ndisable state occurs upon power -up or after any of the following instructions: Write Disable, Page \nProgram, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register, Erase \nSecurity Registe r and Program Security Register.  \n7.1.3  Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register (S4, S3, and \nS2) that provide Write Protection control and s tatus. Block Protect bits can be set using the Write Status \nRegister Instruction (see t W in AC characteristics). All, none or a portion of the memory array can be \nprotected from Program and Erase instructions (see Status Register Memory Protection table). The \nfactory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of the array protected.  \nW25Q128JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date: March 27 , 2018  \n - 16 -                                -Revision C  7.1.4  Top/Bottom Block Protect  (TB) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe non -volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect fro m the \nTop (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in the Status Register Memory Protection table. \nThe factory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the Write Status Register Instruction \ndepending on the state of the SRP, SRL and WEL  bits.  \n7.1.5  Sector /Block  Protect Bit (SEC)  – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable   \nThe non -volatile Sector /Block  Protect bit (SEC)  controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect \neither 4KB Sectors (SEC=1) or 64KB Blocks (SEC=0) in the Top (TB=0) or the B ottom (TB=1) of the array \nas shown in the Status Register Memory Protection table. The  default setting is SEC=0. \n7.1.6  Complement Protect (CMP) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status regis ter (S14). It is used in \nconjunction with SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits to provide more flexibility for the array protection. Once \nCMP is set to 1, previous array protection set by SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 will be reversed. For \ninstance, when CMP=0, a to p 64KB block can be protected while the rest of the array is not; when \nCMP=1, the top 64KB block will become unprotected while the rest of the array become read -only. Please \nrefer to the Status Register Memory Protection table for details.

Status Register -2 \n \n7.1.8  Erase/Program Suspend Status (SUS)  – Status Only  \nThe Suspend Status bit is a read only bit in the status register (S15) that is  set to 1 after executing a \nErase/Program Suspend (75h) instruction. The SUS status bit is cleared to 0 by Erase/Program Resume \n(7Ah) instr uction as well as a power -down, power -up cycle.  \n7.1.9  Security Register Lock Bits  (LB3, LB2, LB1 ) – Volatile/Non -Volatile O TP Writable  \nThe Security Regist er Lock Bits (LB3, LB2, LB1 ) are non -volatile One Time Program (OTP) bits in Sta tus \nRegister (S13, S12, S11 ) that provide the write protect control and status to the Security Registers . The \ndefault state of LB3 -1 is 0, Securi ty Registers are unlocked. LB3 -1 can be set to 1 individually using the \nWrite Status Register instruction. LB3-1 are One Time Programmable (OTP), once it’s set to 1, the \ncorresponding 256 -Byte Security Register will become read -only permanently.  \n7.1.10  Quad Enabl e (QE) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Quad Enable  (QE) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S 9) that allow s Quad SPI \nand QPI operation . When the QE bit is set to a 0 state (factory default  for part numbers with orde ring \noption s “IM”  & “JM” ), the /WP pin  and /HOLD  are enabled. When the QE bit is set to a 1 (factory default for \nQuad Enabled part numbers with ordering option “IQ”  & “JQ” ), the Quad IO2 and I O3 pins are enabled , \nand /WP and /HOLD functions are disabled . \nQE bit is req uired to be set to a 1 before issuing an “ Enter QPI  (38h)” to switch the device from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI to QPI, otherwise the command will be ignored.  When the device is in QPI mode, \nQE bit will remain to be 1. A “Write Status Register” command in QPI mode cannot change QE bit from a \n“1” to a “0”.  \nW25Q128JV -DTR \n \n \n  \n \nRS23 S22 S21 S20 S19 S18 S17 S16\nHOLD\n/RSTDRV1DRV0 WPS\nOutput Driver Strength\nWrite Protect Selection/HOLD or /RESET FunctionR\nReserved\nReserved(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)R() R()\nReserved\n \nFigure 4 c. Status Register -3 \n7.1.11  Write Protect Selection (WP S) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe WPS bit is used to select which Write Protect scheme should be used . When WPS=0, the device will \nuse the com bination o f CMP, SEC, TB, BP[2 :0] bits to protect a specific area of the memory array. When \nWPS=1, the device will utilize the Individual Block Locks to protect any individual sector or blocks. The \ndefault value for all Individual Block Lock bits is 1 upon  device power on or after reset.  \n7.1.12  Output Driver Strength (DRV1, DRV0) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe DRV1 & DRV0 bits are used to determine the output driver strength for the Read operations . \nDRV1, DRV0  Driver Strength  \n0, 0 100%  \n0, 1 75% \n1, 0 50% \n1, 1 25% (default)  \n7.1.13  /HOLD or /RESET Pin Function (HOLD/RST) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe HOLD/RST bit is used to determine whether /HOLD or /RESET function should be implemented on \nthe hardware pin  for 8-pin packages . When HOLD/RST=0 (factory defau lt), the pin acts as /HOLD; when \nHOLD/RST=1, the pin acts as /RESET. However, /HOLD or /RESET functions are only available when \nQE=0. If QE is set to 1, the /HOLD and /RESET functions are disabled, the pin acts as a dedicated data \nI/O pin.  \nW25Q128JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date: March 27 , 2018  \n - 20 -                                -Revision C  7.1.14  Reserved Bits – Non Functional  \nThere are a few reserved Status Register bits that may be read out as a “0” or “1”.

INSTRUCTIONS  \nThe Standard/Dual/Quad SPI instruction set of the W25 Q128JV  consists of 47 basic instructions that are \nfully controlled through the SPI bus (see Instruction Set Table1-2). Instructions are initiated with the falling \nedge of Chip Select (/CS) . The first byte of data clo cked into the DI  input provides the i nstruction code. \nData on t he DI  input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with mo st significant bit (MSB) first.  \nThe QPI instruction set of the W25 Q128JV  consists of 36 basic instructions that are fully controlled \nthrough the SPI bus (see Instruction Set Table 3). Instructions a re initiated with the falling edge of Chip \nSelect (/CS). The first byte of data clocked through IO[3:0] pins provides the instruction code. Data on all \nfour IO pins are  sampled on the rising edge of clock with most significant bit (MSB) first.  All QPI \ninstructions, addresses, data and dummy bytes are using all four IO pins to transfer every byte of data with \nevery two serial clocks (CLK).  \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address bytes, data \nbytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a combination. Instructions are completed with the \nrising edge of edge  /CS. Clock relative timing diagrams for each instruction are included in Figures 5 \nthrough 57. All read instructions can be completed after any cl ocked bit. However, all instructions that \nWrite, Program or Erase must complete on a byte boundary ( /CS driven high after a full 8 -bits have been \nclocked) otherwise the instruction will be ignor ed. This feature further protects the device from inadvertent \nwrites. Additionally, while the memory is being programmed or erased, or when the Status Register is \nbeing written, all instructions except for Read Status Register will be ignored until the program or erase \ncycle has completed.  \n8.1 Device ID and Instruction Set Tables  \n8.1.1  Manufacturer and Device Identification  \nMANUFACTURER ID  (MF7 -

The writable Status \nRegister bi ts include: SRP, SEC, TB, BP[2 :0] in Status Register -1; CMP, LB[3:1], QE, SRL in Status \nRegister -2; HOL D/RST, DRV1, DRV0,  and WPS  in Status Register -3. All other Status Register bit \nlocations are read -only and w ill not be affected by the Write Status Register instruction. LB [3:1] are non -\nvolatile OTP bi ts, once it is set to 1, it can not be cleared to 0.  \nTo write non -volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must previously have \nbeen executed for the device to accept the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL \nmust equal 1). Once write enabled, the instruction is entered by driving /CS low, sending the instruction \ncode “01h /31h/11h ”, and then writing the status reg ister data byte as illustrated in Figure  9a & 9b . \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction must \nhave been executed prior to the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL remains 0). \nHowever, SRL and LB[3:1]  cannot  be changed from “1” to “0” because of the OTP protection for these \nbits. Upon power off  or the execution of a Software/Hardware Reset , the volatile Status Register bit values \nwill be lost, and the non -volatile Status Reg ister bit values will be restored . \nDuring non -volatile Status Register write operation (06h combined with 01h /31h/11h), after /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Write Status Register cycle will commence for a time duration of t W (See AC \nCharacteristics). W hile the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction \nmay still be accessed to check the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Write Status \nRegister cycle and a 0 when the cycle is finished and ready to accept other instructions again. After the \nWrite Status Register cycle has finished, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register will be \ncleared to 0.  \nDuring volatile Status Register write operation (50h combined with 01h /31h/11h), after /CS is  driven high, \nthe Status Register bits will be refreshed to the new values within the time period of t SHSL2  (See AC \nCharacteristics). BUSY bit will remain 0 during the Status Register bit refresh period.  \nThe Write Status Register instruction can be used in  both SPI mode and QPI mode. However, the QE bit \ncannot be written to when the device is in the QPI mode, because QE=1 is required for the device to enter \nand operate in the QPI mode. refer to section 7.1 fo r Status Register descriptions.  \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction\n(01h/31h/11h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 101112131415\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0Register-1/2/3 inMode 0Mode 3\n*\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 9a.

The \ninstruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and then shif ting the instruction code “03h”  followed by a \n24-bit address (A23 -A0) into the DI  pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising edge of the \nCLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location will be shifted out \non the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The address is automatically \nincremented to the next higher address af ter each byte of data is shifted out allowing for a continuous \nstream of data. This means that the entire memory can be accessed with a single instruction as long as \nthe clock continues. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nThe Read Data instr uction sequence is shown in Figure  14. If a Read Data instruction is issued while an \nErase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any \neffects on the current cycle. The Read Data instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of f R \n(see AC Electrical Characteristics).  \nThe Read Data (03h) instruction is only supported in Standard SPI mode. \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (03h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 724-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1\n**\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 14.

Certain \napplications can benefit from this feature and improve the overall system code execution performance.  \nSimilar to a Quad I/O instruction, the Set Burst with Wrap instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low \nand then shifting the instruction code “77h”  followed by 24 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap Bits”, W7 -0. The \ninstruction sequence is shown in Figure 28.

To exit the “Wrap Around” \nfunction and return to normal read operation, another Set Burst with Wrap instruction should be issued to \nset W4 = 1.

A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device \nwill accept the Page Program Instruction (Status Register bit WEL = 1). The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the  /CS pin low then shifting the instruction code “02h” followed by a  24-bit address (A23 -A0) and \nat least one data byte, into the DI  pin. The  /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction \nwhile data is being sent to the device. The Page Program instruction sequence is shown in Figure 2 9. \nIf an entire 25 6 byte page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significant address bits) \nshould be set to 0. If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks exceed s the remaining \npage length, the addressing will wrap to the beginning of  the page. In some cases, less than 256 bytes (a \npartial page) can be programmed without having any effect on other bytes within the same page. One \ncondition to perform a partial page program is that the number of clocks cannot  exceed the remaining \npage le ngth. If more than 256 bytes are sent to the device the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the \npage and overwrite previously sent data.  \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last byte \nhas been latched. If this is not done the Page Program instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Page Program instruction will commence for a time duration of tpp (See AC \nCharacteristics). While the Page Program cycle is in p rogress, the Read Status Register instruction may \nstill be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Page Program \ncycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept other instructions \nagain. After the Page Program cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register \nis cleared to 0. The Page Program instruction will not be executed if the addressed page is protected by \nthe Block Protect ( CMP, SEC, TB , BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits  or the Individual Block /Sector  Locks .  \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (02h)8 9 10 28 29 30 39\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1\n*\n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47\nData Byte 248 49 50 52 53 54 55\n2072\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 051 39\n031\n032 33 34 35 36 37 38\nData Byte 1\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n*\nMode 0Mode 3\nData Byte 3\n2073\n2074\n2075\n2076\n2077\n2078\n20790\nData Byte 256\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*= MSB*\n \nFigure 29a.

The Erase/Program Suspend instruction sequence is shown in Figure 35a & 35b. \nThe Write Status Register inst ruction (01h) and Erase instructions (20h, 52h, D8h, C7h, 60h, 44h) are not \nallowed during Erase Suspend. Erase Suspend is valid only during the Sector or Block erase operation. If \nwritten during the Chip Erase operation, the Erase Suspend instruction is i gnored. The Write Status \nRegister instruction (01h) and Program instructions (02h, 32h, 42h) are not allowed during Program \nSuspend. Program Suspend is valid only during the Page Program or Quad Page Program operation.  \nThe Erase/Program Suspend instruction  “75h” will be accepted by the device only if the SUS bit in the \nStatus Register equals to 0 and the BUSY bit equals to 1 while a Sector or Block Erase or a Page \nProgram operation is on -going. If the SUS bit equals to 1 or the BUSY bit equals to 0, the Sus pend \ninstruction will be ignored by the device. A maximum of time of “t SUS” (See AC Characteristics) is required \nto suspend the erase or program operation. The BUSY bit in the Status Register will be cleared from 1 to \n0 within “t SUS” and the SUS bit in the  Status Register will be set from 0 to 1 immediately after \nErase/Program Suspend. For a previously resumed Erase/Program operation, it is also required that the \nSuspend instruction “75h” is not issued earlier than a minimum of time of “t SUS” following the preceding \nResume instruction “7Ah”.  \nUnexpected power off during the Erase/Program suspend state will reset the device and release the \nsuspend state. SUS bit in the Status Register will also reset to 0. The data within the page, sector or block \nthat was bei ng suspended may become corrupted.

The lower power consumption makes the Power -down \ninstruction especially useful for battery powered applications (See ICC1 and ICC2 in AC Characteristics). \nThe instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “B9h” as  shown in \nFigure 37a & 3 7b.  \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the Power -down \ninstruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the power -down state will entered within the time \nduration of t DP (See AC Characteristics). While in the power -down  state only the Release  Power -down / \nDevice ID (ABh) instruction, which restores the d evice to normal operation, will be recognized. All other \ninstructions are ignored. This includes the Read Status Register instruction, which is always available \nduring normal operation.

It can be used to \nrelease the device from the power -down state , or obtain the devices electro nic identification (ID) number.  \nTo release the device from the power -down state, the instruction is issued by driving the /CS pin low, \nshifting the instruction code “ABh” and driving /CS high as shown in Figure 38a & 3 8b. Release from \npower -down will take  the time duration of t RES1 (See AC Characteristics) before the device will resume \nnormal operation and other instructions are accepted. The /CS pin must remain high during the t RES1 time \nduration.  \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the po wer-down state, the instruction is initiated by \ndriving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3 -dummy bytes. The Device ID \nbits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first . The Device ID \nvalue  for the W25 Q128JV  is listed in Manufacturer and Device Identification table. The Device ID can be \nread continuously. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obtain the Device  ID, the instruction is \nthe same as previously described, and shown in Figure 38c & 3 8d, except that after /CS is driven high it \nmust remain high for a time duration of t RES2 (See AC Characteristics). After this time duration the device \nwill resume normal operation and other instructions will be accepted. If the Release from Power -down / \nDevice ID instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (when BUSY equals \n1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effects on the cu rrent cycle. \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (ABh)Mode 0Mode 3tRES1\nPower-down current Stand-by current\n \nFigure 38a.

Read JEDEC ID Instruc tion (QPI Mode ) \nW25Q128JV -DTR \n \n \n 8.2.31  Erase Security Registers (44h)  \nThe W25 Q128JV  offers three  256-byte Security Registers which can be erased and programmed \nindividually.  These registers may be used by the system manufacturers to store security and other \nimportant informatio n separately from the main memory array.  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction is similar to the Sector Erase instruction . A Write Enable \ninstruction must be executed before th e device will accept the Erase  Security Register  Instruction (Status \nRegister bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “ 44h” followed by a 24-bit address (A23 -A0) to erase one of the three  security register s.  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1 00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nThe Erase  Security Register  instruction sequence is shown in Figure 45. The /CS pin must be driven high \nafter the e ighth bit of the last byte has been l atched. If this is not done the instruction will not  be executed. \nAfter /CS is dri ven high, the self -timed Erase  Security Register operation  will commence for a time \nduration of t SE (See AC Characteristics). While the E rase Security Register cycle is in progress, the Read \nStatus Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is \na 1 during the erase  cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready t o accept \nother instructions again. After the Erase  Security Register  cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch \n(WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0.  The Se curity Register Lock Bits (LB3 -1) in the Status \nRegister -2 can be used to OTP protect the  security registers. Once a lock bit is  set to 1, the corresponding  \nsecurity register will be permanently locked, Erase Security Register instruction to that register will be \nignored (Refer to section 7.1.8  for detail descriptions). \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (44h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 2 1 0\n*Mode 0Mode 3\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 45.

T he SFDP parameters \nare stored in one or more Parameter Identification (PID) tables. Currently only one PID table is specified, \nbut more may be added in the future. The Read SFDP Register instruction is compatible with the SFDP \nstandard initially establishe d in 2010 for PC and other applications, as well as the JEDEC standard \nJESD216 that is published in 2011. Most Winbond SpiFlash Memories shipped after 2011 (date code \n1124 and beyond) support the SFDP feature as specified in the applicable datasheet.  \nThe Read SFDP instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “5Ah” \nfollowed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0)(1) into the DI pin. Eight “dummy” clocks are also required before the \nSFDP register contents are shifted out on the falling edge of the 40th CLK with most significant bit (MSB) \nfirst as shown in Figure 44. For SFDP register values and descriptions, please refer to the Winbond \nApplication Note for SFDP Definition Table.  \nNote 1: A23 -A8 = 0; A7 -A0 are used to define the s tarting byte address for the 256 -Byte SFDP Register.  \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (5Ah)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1*\n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\nDummy Byte\nHigh Impedance40 41 42 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7Data Out 2\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 043 31\n0\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 44.

It allows from one \nbyte to 256 bytes of security register data to be programmed at previously erased  (FFh) memory locations. \nA Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Program Security Register \nInstruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The i nstruction is initiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting \nthe instruction code “42h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. \nThe /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the device.  \n \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nThe Program Security Regis ter instruction sequence is shown in Figure 46.

The instruction is initiated by driving \nthe /CS pin low and then shift ing the instruction code “48h” followed by a 2 4-bit address (A23 -A0) and \neight “dummy” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising edge of the CLK \npin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location will be shifted out on \nthe DO pin at the  falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The byte address is \nautomatically incremented to the next byte address after each byte of data is shifted out . Once the byte \naddress reaches the last byte of the register (byte address FFh), it will reset to address 00h, the first byte \nof the register, and continue to increment.  The instruction is completed by driving /CS high. The Read \nSecurity Register  instruction sequence is shown in Figure 47. If a Read Security Register  instruction is \nissued w hile an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will \nnot have any effects on the current cycle. The Read Security Register  instruction allows clock rates from \nD.C. to a maximum of FR (see AC Electrical Characteri stics).  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (48h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1*\n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\nDummy Byte\nHigh Impedance40 41 42 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7Data Out 2\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 043 31\n0= MSB*\n \nFigure 47.

Th is provides full \nbackward compatibility with earlier generations of Winbond serial flash memories. See Instruction  Set \nTable 1 -3 for all supported SPI commands. In order to sw itch the device to QPI mode, the Quad Ena ble \n(QE) bit in Status Register -2 must b e set to 1 first, and an “ Enter QPI  (38h)” instruction must be issued. If \nthe Quad E nable (QE) bit is 0, the “Enter  QPI (38h)” instruction will be ignored and the device will remain \nin SPI mode.  \nSee Instruction Set Table 3  for all the commands supported in  QPI mode.  \nWhen the device is switched from SPI mode to QPI mode, the existing  Write Enable and Program/Erase \nSuspend status, and the Wrap Length setting will remain unchanged.  \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (38h)\nHigh ImpedanceMode 0Mode 3\n \nFigure 51.

To \navoid accidental reset, both instructions must be issued in sequen ce. Any other commands other than  \n“Reset (99h)” after the “Enable Reset (66h)” command will disable the “Reset Enable”  state. A new \nsequence of “Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” is needed to reset the device.  Once the Reset \ncommand is accepted by the device, the device will take approximately tRST=30us to reset. During this \nperiod, no command will be accepted.  \nData c orruption may happen if there is an on -going or suspended internal Erase or Program  operation \nwhen Reset command sequence is accepted by the device.
