ADA4851-4, 14-Lead TSSOP (RU-14) \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADA4851-1 (single), ADA4851-2 (dual), and ADA4851-4 \n(quad) are low cost, high speed, voltage feedback rail-to-rail \noutput op amps. Despite their low price, these parts provide excellent overall performance and versatility. The 130 MHz, −3 dB bandwidth and high slew rate make these amplifiers well \nsuited for many general-purpose, high speed applications. \nThe ADA4851 family is designed to operate at supply voltages \nas low as +3 V and up to ±5 V . These parts provide true single-supply capability, allowing input signals to extend 200 mV \nbelow the negative rail and to within 2.2 V of the positive rail. \nOn the output, the amplifiers can swing within 60 mV of either \nsupply rail. \nWith their combination of low price, excellent differential gain \n(0.08%), differential phase (0.09º), and 0.1 dB flatness out to \n11 MHz, these amplifiers are ideal for consumer video applications.  \nThe ADA4851-1W , ADA4851-2W , and ADA4851-4W are \nautomotive grade versions, qualified for automotive applications. See the Automotive Products  section for more details. The \nADA4851 family is designed to work over the extended \ntemperature range (−40°C to +125°C).  \nCLOSED-LOOP GAIN (dB)\n1 100 10 1k\n05143-004 FREQUENCY (MHz)–6–4\n–5–2\n–30\n–12\n14\n3G = +1\nVS = 5V\nRL = 1kΩ\nCL = 5pF\n \nFigure 4.

At approximately 150°C, \nwhich is the glass transition temperature, the plastic changes its \nproperties. Even temporarily exceeding this temperature limit may change the stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric performance of the amplifiers. Exceeding a junction temperature of 150°C for an \nextended period can result in changes in silicon devices, \npotentially causing degradation or loss of functionality.  Figure 5.

J | Page 17 of 24 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe ADA4851-1/ADA4851-2/ADA4851-4 feature a high slew \nrate input stage that is a true single-supply topology, capable of sensing signals at or below the negative supply rail. The rail-to-rail output stage can pull within 60 mV of either supply rail when \ndriving light loads and within 0.17 V when driving 150 Ω. High \nspeed performance is maintained at supply voltages as low as 2.7 V . \nHEADROOM CONSIDERATIONS \nThese amplifiers are designed for use in low voltage systems.  \nTo obtain optimum performance, it is useful to understand the \nbehavior of the amplifiers as input and output signals approach the headroom limits of the amplifiers. The input common-mode voltage range of the amplifiers extends from the negative supply voltage (actually 200 mV below the negative supply), or from \nground for single-supply operation, to within 2.2 V of the positive \nsupply voltage. Therefore, at a gain of 3, the amplifiers can provide full rail-to-rail output swing for supply voltages as low \nas 3.3 V and down to 3 V for a gain of 4.  \nExceeding the headroom limit is not a concern for any inverting \ngain on any supply voltage as long as the reference voltage at the positive input of the amplifier lies within the input common- mode range of the amplifier. \nThe input stage is the headroom limit for signals approaching \nthe positive rail. Figure 40  shows a typical offset voltage vs. the \ninput common-mode voltage for the ADA4851-1/ADA4851-2/ \nADA4851-4 amplifiers on a ± 5 V supply. Accurate dc performance \nis maintained from approximately 200 mV below the negative \nsupply to within 2.2 V of the positive supply. For high speed \nsignals, however, there are other considerations. Figure 41  \nshows −3 dB bandwidth vs. input common-mode voltage for a \nunity-gain follower. As the common-mode voltage approaches 2 V of positive supply, the amplifier responds well but the bandwidth begins to drop as the common-mode voltage \napproaches the positive supply. This can manifest itself in \nincreased distortion or settling time. Higher frequency signals require more headroom than the lower frequencies to maintain \ndistortion performance. 600580560540520500480460440\n–6 –5 –4 –3 –2 –1 0 1 2 3 4VOS (μV)\nVCM (V)\n05143-046 \nFigure 40.

J | Page 18 of 24 Figure 42  illustrates how the rising edge settling time for the \namplifier is configured as a unity-gain follower, stretching out \nas the top of a 1 V step input that approaches and exceeds the \nspecified input common-mode voltage limit. \nFor signals approaching the negative supply and inverting gain \nand high positive gain configurations, the headroom limit is the \noutput stage. The ADA4851-1/ADA4851-2/ADA4851-4 amplifiers \nuse a common emitter output stage. This output stage maximizes the available output range, limited by the saturation voltage of the output transistors. The saturation voltage increases with the \ndrive current that the output transistor is required to supply due \nto the collector resistance of the output transistor.  \n1.82.02.22.42.62.83.03.23.4\n0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0OUTPUT VOLTAGE (V)\nTIME (ns)\n05143-0523.6\nVSTEP  = 2V TO 3V\nVSTEP  = 2.1V TO 3.1V\nVSTEP  = 2.2V TO 3.2V\nVSTEP  = 2.3V TO 3.3V\nVSTEP  = 2.4V TO 3.4VG = +1\nRL = 1kΩ\nVS = 5V\n \nFigure 42. Output Rising Edge for 1 V Step at Input Headroom Limits \nAs the saturation point of the output stage is approached, the \noutput signal shows increasing amounts of compression and clipping. As in the input headroom case, higher frequency signals require slightly more headroom than the lower fre-quency signals. Figure 16  illustrates this point by plotting the \ntypical harmonic distortion vs. the output amplitude.  \nOVERLOAD BEHAVIOR AND RECOVERY \nInput \nThe specified input common-mode voltage of the ADA4851-1/ ADA4851-2/ADA4851-4 is 200 mV below the negative supply \nto within 2.2 V of the positive supply. Exceeding the top limit \nresults in lower bandwidth and increased rise time, as shown in \nFigure 41  and Figure 42 . Pushing the input voltage of a unity-\ngain follower to less than 2 V from the positive supply leads to \nthe behavior shown in Figure 43 —an increasing amount of output \nerror as well as a much increased settling time. The recovery time from input voltages of 2.2 V or closer to the positive supply is approximately 55 ns, which is limited by the settling artifacts \ncaused by transistors in the input stage coming out of saturation. The amplifiers do not exhibit phase reversal, even for input \nvoltages beyond the voltage supply rails. Going more than 0.6 V \nbeyond the power supplies turns on protection diodes at the input \nstage, which greatly increases the current draw of the devices. \nOUTPUT VOLTAGE (V)\nTIME (ns)\n05143-0512.002.252.503.003.253.50\n2.75\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1kG = +1\nRL = 1kΩ\nVS = 5V\nVSTEP  = 2.25V TO 3.25V\nVSTEP  = 2.25V TO\n3.5V, 4V, AND 5V\n \nFigure 43.

J | Page 19 of 24 SINGLE-SUPPLY VIDEO AMPLIFIER An example of an 8 MHz, three-pole, Sallen-Key, low-pass, \nvideo reconstruction filter is shown in Figure 46 . This circuit \nfeatures a gain of 3, has a 0.1 dB bandwidth of 8.2 MHz, and over 17 dB attenuation at 27 MHz (see Figure 47 ). The filter has \nthree poles; two are active with a third passive pole (R6 and C4) placed at the output. C3 improves the filter roll-off. R6, R7, and R8 comprise the video load of 150 Ω. Components R6, C4, R7, R8, and the input termination of the network analyzer form a 12.8 dB attenuator; therefore, the reference level is roughly −3.3 dB, as shown in Figure 47 . The ADA4851 family of amplifiers is well suited for portable \nvideo applications. When operating in low voltage single-supply \napplications, the input signal is limited by the input stage headroom.

Excessive phase shift introduced by lower frequency op amps can significantly affect the filter performance.  \nA common application for active filters is at the output of video \nDACs/encoders. The filter, or more appropriately, the video reconstruction filter, is used at the output of a video DAC/ encoder to eliminate the multiple images that are created during the sampling process within the DAC. For portable video appli-\ncations, the ADA4851 family of amplifiers is an ideal choice due \nto its lower power requirements and high performance.  \nFigure 47.
