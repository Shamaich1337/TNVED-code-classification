Position the oscillograph probe \nbetween 51mm and 76mm (2in and 3in) from the \nmodule \n \nFigure 2. Peak-to-Peak Output Ripple Test Setup \n \nDesign Considerations  \nInput filtering \nThe power module should be connected to a low ac-\nimpedance input source. Highly inductive source \nimpedances can affect the stability of the power module. \nFor the test configuration in Figure1 47µF aluminum \nelectrolytic capacitor, mounted close to the power module \nhelps ensure stability of the unit.  Safety Considerations \nFor safety-agency approval of the system in which the \npower module is used, the power  module must be installed \nin compliance with the spacing and separation \nrequirements of the end-use safety agency standard, i.e. CAN/CSA-C22.2, No. 60950-1 and IEC60950-1, and also \ncompliance with UL62368-1, CAN/CSA C22.2 No. 62368-1-\n14, EN62368-1 and IEC62368-1, if the system in which the power module is to be used must meet safety agency \nrequirements. \n Basic insulation based on 75Vdc input is provided between the input and output of the module for the purpose of applying insulation requirements when the input to this DC- \nto-DC converter is identified as TNV-2 or SELV. An \nadditional evaluation is needed if the source is other than \nTNV-2 or SELV. \n When the input source is SELV circuit, the power module \nmeets SELV (safety extra-low voltage) requirements. If the \ninput source is a hazardous voltage which is greater than 60Vdc and less than or equal to 75Vdc, for the module’s \noutput to meet SELV requirements, all of the following must \nbe met: \n\uf06e The input source must be insulated from the ac mains \nby reinforced or double insulation. \n\uf06e The input terminals of the module are not operator \naccessible. \n\uf06e If the metal baseplate is grounded, one Vi pin and one \nVo pin shall also be grounded. \n\uf06e A SELV reliability test is conducted on the system \nwhere the module is used, in combination with the \nmodule, to ensure that under a single fault, hazardous \nvoltage does not appear at the module’s output. \nWhen installed into a Class II equipment (without \ngrounding), spacing consideration should be given to the \nend-use installation, as the spacing between the module and mounting surface have not been evaluated. \n \nThe power module has extra-low voltage (ELV) outputs when all inputs are ELV.  This power module is not internally fused. To achieve \noptimum safety and system protec tion, an input line fuse is \nhighly recommended. The safety agencies require a \nnormal-blow fuse with 14A maximum rating to be installed \n                       \n  \n \n Document No. SLM1W98.A                                Rev. 1.00                                Page 7 of 15  in the ungrounded lead. A lower rated fuse can be used \nbased on the maximum inrush transient energy and \nmaximum input current.  \nFeature Descriptions  \nRemote On/Off \nThe REM pin is used to turn the power converter remote on or off via a system signal. This power module is negative logic, which turns the module on when the REM pin is at \nlogic low and off when it is at logic high. We also provide \npositive logic remote On/Off which turns the module on during logic high and off during logic low.  To turn the power module on and off, the user must supply a \nswitch to control the voltage between the REM pin and -Vin \nterminal (see Figure3). A logic low is V\nREM =-0 to 1.2 V.  \nDuring logic high, the maximum V REM voltage generated by \nthe power module is 15V.   \nIf not using the remote on/off feature, perform one of the \nfollowing to turn the converter on: For negative logic, short REM pin to -Vin.  \nFor positive logic, leave REM pin open. \n \nFigure 3. Remote On/Off Application Circuit  \nOutput Voltage Set-Point Adjustment \nOutput voltage trim allows the user to increase or decrease \nthe output voltage set point of a module. This is \naccomplished by connecting an external resistor between the \nTRIM pin and either the +S or -S pins. The trim resistor \nshould be positioned close to the module. If not using the trim feature, leave the TRIM pin open. \n \nTo increase the output voltage, refer to Figure 4. A trim resistor, R\ntrimup, should be connected between the TRIM and \n+S, with a value of: \ntrimupR= \uf057\uf02d\uf044\uf02d\uf044\uf044\uf02bKVOUT)22.10511\n*225.1) 100(*11.5*(  \ntrimupR= Required value of trim-up resistor [k Ω] \n100\uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d\uf044\nOUTOUT trimup\nVV V\n \nOUTV   = Nominal value of output voltage [V] \ntrimupV= Desired (trimmed) output voltage [V]. \n \nFigure 4.

Circuit Configuration to Decrease Output \nVoltage.  \n \nProtection Feature \nInput Under Voltage Protection \nAt input voltages below the input under-voltage lockout limit, \nthe module operation is disabled. The module will begin to \noperate at an input voltage above the under-voltage lockout \nturn-on threshold.  \n \nOutput Over Voltage Protection \nThe output over-voltage protection consists of circuitry that monitors the voltage of the output terminals. If the output \nvoltage exceeds the over-voltage protection threshold, then \nthe module will operate in a hiccup mode until the overvoltage cause is cleared. \n \n Output Over Current Protection \nTo provide protection in an output overload fault condition, \nthe module is equipped with internal current-limiting circuitry, and can endure current limiting for an unlimited duration. At \nthe instance of current-limit in ception, the module enters a \n"hiccup" mode of operation, whereby it shuts down and automatically attempts to rest art. While the fault condition \nexists, the module will remain in this mode until the fault is \ncleared. The unit operates normally once the output current \nis reduced back into its specified range.  \n \nOver Temperature Protection  \nTo provide protection under certain fault conditions, the \nmodule is equipped with a thermal shutdown circuit. The \nmodule will shutdown when the Tref temperature exceeds \nOTP set value, but the thermal shutdown is not intended as a guarantee that the module will survive when the \ntemperature beyond its rating. The module will \nautomatically restarts after it cools down.  \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \nFigure 6. Tref Temperature Measurement Location \n \nInput Under Voltage Lockout  \nInput under voltage lockout is standard with this converter, \nwhen input voltages below the input under voltage lockout \nlimit, the module operation is disabled. It will only begin to operate once the input voltage is raised above the under \nvoltage lockout turn-on threshold. \n \nThermal Considerations \nThe power modules operate in a variety of thermal \nenvironments; however, sufficient cooling should be \nprovided to help ensure reliable operation of the unit. Heat \nis removed by conduction, convection, and radiation to the surrounding environment.  Considerations include ambi ent temperature, airflow, \nmodule power dissipation, and the need for increased \nreliability. A reduction in the operating temperature of the \nmodule will result in an increase in reliability. \n \n \nHeat Transfer via Convection \nIncreased airflow over the module enhances the heat \ntransfer via convection.

Recommended Airflow Direction \n \nSoldering Information （Surface \nmounting  Version） \nReflow Soldering Information \nThese power modules are large mass, low thermal \nresistance devices and typically heat up slower than other \nSMT components. It is recommended that the customer \nreview data sheets in order to  customize the solder reflow \nprofile for each application board assembly. \n The following instructions must be observed when SMT \nsoldering these units. Failure to observe these instructions \nmay result in the failure of or cause damage to the modules, and can adversely affect long-term reliability.  Typically, the eutectic solder melts at 217 ℃ for Pb-free \nsolder process and 183 ℃ for SnPb solder process, wets \nthe land, and subsequently wicks the device connection. Sufficient time must be allowed to fuse the plating on the \nconnection to ensure a reliable solder joint. There are \nseveral types of SMT reflow technologies currently used in the industry. These surface mount power modules can be \nreliably soldered using natural forced convection, IR \n(radiant infrared), or a combination of convection/IR. For \nreliable soldering the solder  reflow profile should be \nestablished by accurately measuring the modules pin connector temperatures. \n \nLead-free (Pb-free) solder processes \nFor Pb-free solder processes, a pin temperature (T PIN) in \nexcess of the solder melting temperature (T L, +217 to \n+221°C for Sn/Ag/Cu solder alloys) for more than 30 \nseconds, and a peak temperature of +235°C on all solder joints is recommended to ensure a reliable solder joint.  \n \nFor Pb-free solder processes, the product is qualified for MSL 3 according to IPC/JEDEC standard J-STD-020C. \nDuring reflow, T\nP must not exceed +245°C at any time.  \n \x7f\x7f\x7f \nFigure 8.

The residues may affect long time reliability and \nisolation voltage. \n \nStorage and Handling \nThe recommended storage environment and handling procedures for moisture-sensitive surface mount packages are detailed in J-STD-033 Rev. B (Handling, Packing, Shipping and Use of Moisture/Reflow Sensitive Surface Mount Devices). Moisture barrier bags (MBB) with \ndesiccant are required for max. MSL1condition. These \nsealed packages should not be broken until time of use. \nOnce the original package is broken, the floor life of the \nproduct at conditions of ≤ 30°C and 60% relative humidity \nvaries according to the MSL rating (see J-STD-033B).The \nshelf life for dry packed SMT packages will be a minimum \nof 12 months from the bag seal date, when stored at the \nfollowing conditions: < 40° C, < 90% relative humidity . \n \nPost Solder Cleaning and Drying Considerations \nPost solder cleaning is usually the final circuit-board assembly process prior to electrical board testing. The \nresult of inadequate cleaning and drying can affect both the \nreliability of a power module and the testability of the finished circuit-board assembly.  \n \nElectromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) \nThe Figure 9 shows a suggested configuration to meet the \nconducted EMI limits of EN55032 Class A. \n \nFigure 9.
