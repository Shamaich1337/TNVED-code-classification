Signal quality is main-\ntained over a wide bandwidth with worst-case distortion of–40 dBc @ 250 MHz (G = +10, 1 V p-p). For applications with\nmultitone signals, such as IF signal chains, the third order\ninterc ept (3IP) of 12 dBm is achieved at the same frequency. This\ndistortion performance coupled with the current feedback\narchitecture make the AD8009 a flexible component for a gain\nstage amplifier in IF/RF signal chains.\nThe AD8009 is capable of delivering over 175 mA of load current\nand will drive four back terminated video loads while maintaininglow differential gain and phase error of 0.02% and 0.04 °,\nrespectively. T he high drive capability is also reflected in the\nability to deliver 10 dBm of output power @ 70 MHz with\n–38 dBc SFDR.\nThe AD8009 is available in a small SOIC package and will\noperate over the industrial temperature range –40 °C to +85 °C.\nThe AD8009 is also available in an SOT-23-5 and will operate\nover the commercial temperature range of 0 °C to 70 °C.\n–30\n–80–40\n–50–60–70\n–100–90\n1DISTORTION (dBc) \nFREQUENCY RESPONSE (MHz)70 10G = 2\nRF = 301 /H9024\nVO = 2V p-p\nSECOND\n150/H9024 LOADSECOND\n100/H9024 LOAD\nTHIRD150/H9024 LOADTHIRD100/H9024 LOAD\nFigure 2.

The maxi-\nmum  safe junction temperature for plastic encapsulated devices\nis determined by the glass transition temperature of the plastic,\napproximately 150 °C. Exceeding this limit temporarily may cause\na shift in parametric performance due to a change in the stressesexerted on the die by the package. Exceeding a junction tempera-ture of 175 °C for an extended period can result in device failure.\nWhile the AD8009 is internally short circuit protected, this may\nnot be sufficient to guarantee that the maximum junction tempera-\nture (150 °C) is not exceeded under all conditions. To ensure\nproper operation, it is necessary to observe the maximum power\nderating curves.\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE ( /H11543C)90 802.0\n1.0\n01.5\n0.5\n–50  TJ = 150 C  MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)\n70 60 504030 20 100 –40 –30 –20 –10  8-LEAD SOIC PACKAGE \n  5-LEAD SOT-23 PACKAGE \nFigure 3.

Frequency Response of Band-Pass Filter Circuit\nAPPLICATIONS\nAll current feedback op amps are affected by stray capacitance\non their –INPUT. TPCs 35 and 36 illustrate the AD 8009’s\nresponse to such capacitance.\nTPC 35 shows the bandwidth can be extended by placing a\ncapacitor in parallel with the gain resistor. The small signal pulseresponse corresponding to such an increase in capacitance/band-\nwidth is shown in TPC 36.\nAs a practical consideration, the higher the capacitance on the\n–INPUT to GND, the higher R\nF needs to be to minimize\npeaking/ringing.\nRF Filter Driver\nThe output drive capability, wide bandwidth, and low distortionof the AD8009 are well suited for creating gain blocks that candrive RF filters. Many of these filters require that the input be\ndriven by a 50 Ω source, while the output must be terminated in\n50 Ω for the filters to exhibit their specified frequency response.TPC 37 shows a circuit for driving and measuring the frequency\nresponse of a filter, a Wavetek 5201 tunable band-pass filter thatis tuned to a 50 MHz center frequency. The HP8753D network\nprovides a stimulus signal for the measurement. The analyzer has\na 50 Ω source impedance that drives a cable that is terminated in\n50 Ω at the high impedance noninverting input of the AD8009.\nThe AD8009 is set at a gain of +2. The series 50 Ω resistor at the\noutput, along with the 50 Ω termination provided by the fi lter and\nits termination, yield an overall unity gain for the measuredpath. The frequency response plot of TPC 38 shows the  circuit\nto have an insertion loss of 1.3 dB in the pass band and about\n75 dB rejection in the stop band.\nAD8009\n–12– REV.

Driving an Additional High Resolution Monitor Using Three AD8009s\nRGB Monitor Driver\nHigh resolution computer monitors require very high full power\nbandwidth signals to maximize their display resolution. The\nRGB signals that drive these monitors are generally provided by\na current-out RAMDAC that can directly drive a 75 Ω doubly\nterminated line.\nThere are times when the same output wants to be delivered to\nadditional monitors. The termination provided internally by\neach monitor prohibits the ability to simply connect a second\nmonitor in parallel with the first. Additional buffering must beprovided.\nFigure 4 shows a connection diagram for two high resolution\nmonitors being driven by an ADV7160 or ADV7162, a 220 MHz\n(Megapixel per second) triple RAMDAC. This pixel rate\nrequires a driver whose full power bandwidth is at least half the\npixel rate or 110 MHz. This is to provide good resolution for a\nworst-case signal that swings between zero scale and full scaleon adjacent pixels.The primary monitor is connected in the conventional fashion\nwith a 75 Ω termination to ground at each end of the 75 Ω\ncable. Sometimes this c onfiguration is called “doubly termi-\nnated” and is used when the driver is a high output impedance\ncurrent source.\nFor the additional monitor, each of the RGB signals close to the\nRAMDAC output is applied to a high input impedance, noninvert-\ning input of an AD8009 that is configured for a gain of +2. The\noutputs each drive a series 75 Ω resistor, cable, and termination\nresistor in the monitor that divides the output signal by two, thus\nproviding an overall unity gain. This scheme is referred to as\n“back termination” and is used when the driver is a low outputimpedance voltage source. Back termination requires that the\nvoltage of the signal be double the value that the monitor sees.\nDouble termination requires that the output current be double thevalue that flows in the monitor termination.\n–13– REV. FAD8009\nDriving a Capacitive Load\nA capacitive load, like that presented by some A/D converters,\ncan sometimes be a challenge for an op amp to drive depending\non the architecture of the op amp. Most of the problem is caused\nby the pole created by the output impedance of the op amp andthe capacitor that is driven. This creates extra phase shift that\ncan eventually cause the op amp to become unstable.\nOne way to prevent instability and improve settling time when\ndriving a capacitor is to insert a resistor in series between theop amp output and the capacitor. The feedback resistor is still\nconnected directly to the output of the op amp, while the series\nresistor provides some isolation of the capacitive load from theop amp output.\n10/H9262F+0.1/H9262F 0.001 /H9262F10/H9262F+\n0.1/H9262F 0.001 /H9262F\nAD800949.9 /H9024+5V\n–5V3\n24RTRS\nCL 50pF2VSTEP7\n6\nRFRGG = +2: RF = 301 /H9024 = RG\nG = +10: RF = 200 /H9024, RG = 22.1 /H9024\nFigure 5. Capacitive Load Drive CircuitFigure 5 shows such a circuit with an AD8009 driving a 50 pF\nload. With R S = 0, the AD8009 circuit will be unstable. For a\ngain of +2 and +10, it was found experimentally that setting R S\nto 42.2 Ω will minimize the 0.1% settling time with a 2 V step at\nthe output. The 0.1% settling time was measured to be 40 ns withthis circuit.\nFor smaller capacitive loads, a smaller R\nS will yield optimal\nsettling time, while a larger R S will be required for larger capacitive\nloads. Of course, a larger capacitance will always require moretime for settling to a given accuracy than a smaller one, and this\nwill be lengthened by the increase in R\nS required. At best, a\ngiven RC combination will require about seven time constantsby itself to settle to 0.1%, so a limit will be reached where too\nlarge a capacitance cannot be driven by a given op amp and still\nmeet the system’s required settling time specification.\nAD8009\n–14– REV.
