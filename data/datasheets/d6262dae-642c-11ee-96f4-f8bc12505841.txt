RM-8 (MSOP) and R-8 (SOIC) \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8057 (single) and AD8058 (dual) are very high perfor-\nmance amplifiers with a very low cost. The balance between \ncost and performance make them ideal for many applications. The AD8057 and AD8058 reduce the need to qualify a variety \nof specialty amplifiers. The AD8057 and AD8058  are voltage \nfeedback amplifiers with the bandwidth and slew rate normally \nfound in current feedback amplifiers. The AD8057 and AD8058 \nare low power amplifiers having low quiescent current and a wide \nsupply range from 3 V to 12 V . They have noise and distortion performance required for high end video systems as well as dc \nperformance parameters rarely found in high speed amplifiers.  \nThe AD8057 and AD8058 are available in standard SOIC \npackaging as well as tiny 5-lead SOT-23 ( AD8057 ) and 8-lead \nMSOP ( AD8058) packages. These amplifiers are available in the \nindustrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C.

Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect \ndevic e reliability.  MAXIMUM POWER DISSIP ATION  \nThe maximum power that can be safely dissipated by the \nAD8057/ AD8058  is limited by the  associated rise in junction \ntemperature. Exceeding a junction temperature of 175°C for  \nan extended period can result in device failure.

Figure 43 shows the relationship between \nthe capacitive load that results in 30% overshoot and the closed -\nloop gain of an  AD8058. It can be seen that, under the gain = +2 \ncondition, the device is stable with cap acitive loads of up to 69 pF.  \nIn general, to minimize peaking or to ensure device stability for \nlarger values of capacitive lo ads, a small series resistor  (RS) can \nbe added between the op amp output and the load capacitor  \n(CL) as shown in Figure 44.  \nFor the setup shown in Figure 44, the relations hip between R S \nand C L was empirically derived and is shown in T able 4. \nCLOSED-LOOP GAIN500\n400\n0\n5 1 2 3 4CL (pF)300\n200\n100RS = 2.4Ω\nRS = 0Ω\n01064-044 \nFigure 43.

This clock feedthrough is usually at  \n27 MHz, which is a standard clock frequency for both NTSC \nand PAL video systems. A filter that passes the video band and rejects frequencies at 27 MHz can be used to remove these fre -\nquencies from the video signal.  \nFigure 46 shows a circuit that uses an AD8057 to create a single  \n5 V supply , 3-pole  Sallen -Key filter. This circuit uses a single RC \npole in front of a standard 2 -pole active section. To shift the dc \noperating point to midsupply , ac coupling is provided by R4,  R5, \nand C4.  \n2\n30.1µF+\n10µF\nAD80577\n46+5V\n+5V\nR4\n10kΩ\nR5\n10kΩC4\n0.1µFR3\n49.9ΩR2\n499Ω\nC1100pFR1\n200ΩRF\n1kΩC2\n680pF\nC336pF\n01064-047 \nFigure 46.

Video Filter Response  \nDIFFERENTIAL ANALOG -TO- DIGITAL DRIVER  \nAs system supply voltages are dropping, many ADCs provide \ndifferential analog inputs to increase the dynamic range of the \ninput signal while still operating on a low supply voltage. \nDifferential driving can also reduce second and other even-\norder distortion products.  \nAnalog Devices , Inc., offers an assortment of 12 - and 14 -bit \nhigh speed converters t hat have differential inputs and can be \nrun from a single 5 V supply. These include the AD9220 , AD9221 , \nAD9223, AD9224, and AD9225  at 12 bits, and the AD9240, \nAD9241, and AD9243 at 14 bits. Although these devices can \noperate over a range of  common -mode voltages at their analog \ninputs, they work best when the common -mode voltage at the \ninput is at the midsupply  or 2.5 V .  \nOp amp architectures that require upwards of 2 V of headroom \nat the output have significant problems when trying to drive such ADCs while operating with a 5 V positive supply. The low \nheadroom output design of the AD8057 and AD8058 make \nthem ideal for driving these types of ADCs.  \nThe AD8058 can be used to make a dc -coupled, single -ended-\nto-differential driver for one of these ADCs. Figure 48 is a \nschematic of such a circuit for  driving an AD9225, 12 -bit, \n25 MSPS ADC.  230.1µF 10µF0.1µF 10µF\n0.1µF 10µF+\n8\n1+5V\n1kΩAD80581kΩ1kΩ\n1kΩ\n1kΩ\n50Ω50Ω\n1kΩ1kΩ1kΩ6\n57\n+\n–5V4VIN\n0V\nVINBVINA\nAD9225+5V+\nREF+2.5V\nAD8058\n01064-049 \nFigure 48. Schematic Circuit for Driving AD9225   \nIn this circuit, one of the op amps is configured in the inverting \nmode  whereas  the other is in the noninverting mode. Howeve r, \nto provide better bandwidth matching, each op amp is configured  \nfor a noise gain of +2. The inverting op amp is configured for a  \ngain of − 1 and the noninverting op amp is configured for a  gain \nof +2. Each of these produces a noise gain of +2, which is d eter-\nmined only by the inverse of the feedback ratio. The input signal  to \nthe noninverting op amp is divided by two  to normalize its level \nand make it equal to the inverting output.  \nFor 0 V input, the outputs of the op amps want to be at 2.5 V , \nwhich is th e midsupply level of the ADCs. This is accomplished by \nfirst taking the 2.5 V refere nce output of the ADC and divid ing it \nby two by a pair of  1 kΩ resistors. The resulting 1.25  V is applied  to \nthe positive input  of each op amp . This voltage is then multiplied  by \nthe gain of +2 of the op amps to provide a 2.5 V level at each output.   \nThe assumption for this circuit is that the input signal is bipola r \nwith respect to ground and the circuit must be dc -coupled  thereby  \nimplying  the existence of a negat ive supply elsewhere in the sys tem. \nThis circuit  uses −5 V as the negative supply for the AD 8058.  \nTying the  negative supply of the AD8058 to ground  causes a \nproblem at the input of the noninverting op amp. The input \ncommon -mode voltage can only go to within 1  V of the negative  \nrail. Because  this circuit requires that the positive inputs operate \nwith a 1.25 V bias, there is not enough room to swing this voltage  \nin the negative direction. The inverting stage does  not have this \nproblem because its common -mode input voltage remains fixe d \nat 1.25 V . If dc coupling is not required, various ac coupling \ntechniques can be used to eliminate this problem.   \nLAYOUT  \nThe AD8057 and AD8058 are high speed op amps for  use in a \nboard layout that  follows standard high speed design rules. Make  \nall signal traces as short and direct as possible. In particular, keep \nthe parasitic capacitance on the inverting input of each device to a minimum to avoid excessive peaking and other undesirable \nperformance. Bypass t he power supplies very close to the power pins  \nof the package with a 0.1 µF capacitor in parallel with a larger  \n(approximately 10 µF ) tantalum capacitor. Connect t hese capacito rs \nto a ground plane that either is  on an inner layer or fills the area \nof the board that is not used for other signals.  \n \nRev.
