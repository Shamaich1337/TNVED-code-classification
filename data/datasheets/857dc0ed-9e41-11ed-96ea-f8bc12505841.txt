Indalloy or 80/20, Au/Sn, solders \nare acceptable. Maximum soldering temperature must be <300°C for <10 sec. These chips are designed to \nbe inserted onto hard or soft substrates with the junction side down. They should be mounted onto silk-\nscreened circuits using electrically conductive Ag epoxy, approximately 1 -2 mils in thickness and cured at               \napproximately 90°C to 150°C per manufacturer’s schedule. For extended cure times, >30 minutes,          \ntemperatures must be kept below 200°C.
