#### Description:
The SMBJ3V3 is a surface-mount Transient Voltage Suppressor (TVS) diode designed to protect sensitive electronic components from voltage transients. It is specifically tailored for applications requiring protection against overvoltage conditions, such as those induced by inductive load switching and lightning strikes. The device features a unidirectional design, making it suitable for clamping positive voltage spikes while allowing normal operation under standard conditions.

#### Typical Applications:
- Protection of integrated circuits (ICs) and MOSFETs from voltage transients.
- Safeguarding signal lines in sensor units, particularly those powered by 3.3 V supplies.
- General transient voltage suppression in sensitive electronic equipment, ensuring reliability and longevity in various electronic applications.

This component is particularly useful in automotive and industrial applications where voltage spikes can occur frequently, necessitating robust protection mechanisms to maintain circuit integrity.
