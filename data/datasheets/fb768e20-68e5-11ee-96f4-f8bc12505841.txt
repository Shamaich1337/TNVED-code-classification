The device uses N-channel MOSFETs to switch between supplies while providing a controlled slew rate when\nvoltage is first applied.\nThe TPS2116 can be configured for two different switchover behaviors depending on the application. Automatic\npriority mode prioritizes the supply connected to VIN1 and switches over to the secondary supply (VIN2) when\nVIN1 drops. Manual mode allows the user to toggle a GPIO or enable signal to switch between channels.\nDue to its low quiescent of 1.32 uA (typical) and standby current of 50 nA (typical), the TPS2116 is ideal for\nsystems where a battery is connected to one of the inputs. These low currents extend the life and operation of\nthe battery when in use.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n7.3 Feature Description\nThe below sections detail the features of the TPS2116.\n7.3.1 Truth Table\nThe below table shows the expected behavior of the TPS2116.

However, when the device\nswitches from one power supply to another (switchover) and VOUT > 1 V, soft start is not used to minimize the\noutput voltage drop. For linear soft start behavior, it is recommended to have an output capacitance of at least\n0.1 µF.\n7.3.3 Status Indication\nThe ST pin is an open drain output that should be pulled up to an external voltage for proper operation. When\nthe TPS2116 is powering the output using VIN1, the ST pin will be pulled high by the external voltage source.\nEven if the device is blocking reverse current from VOUT to VIN1, selection of VIN1 will keep the ST pin pulled\nhigh. When the TPS2116 is powering the output using VIN2 or both channels are disabled, the ST pin will be\npulled low. During thermal shutdown, the ST pin will be pulled low regardless of the channel being used.\n7.3.4 Reverse Current Blocking\nThe TPS2116 initiates reverse current blocking (RCB) when the VOUT voltage is externally biased and exceeds\nthe input voltage supply being used. Once the output voltage is higher than the input voltage by 42mV (V RCB,R ),\nthe device will shut off. During this state, the leakage into VOUT and out of VIN is defined by I REV. Once the\nvoltage difference between the output and input lowers to 17mV (V RCB,F ), the channel will turn back on.\nFigure 7-1. Reverse Current Blocking Behavior\nIf RCB is expected to occur, it is recommended to clamp the output or use a high output capacitance (about\n100µF). This will prevent voltage spikes from damaging the device due to output inductance.\n7.4 VINx Collapse Rate\nThe TPS2116 uses the highest voltage supply to power the device. When one supply drops below the other, the\ndevice changes the supply used to power the device. If the supply powering the device drops at a rate faster\nthan 1 V/10 μs, the other supply must be at 2.5 V or higher to prevent the device from resetting. If the other\nsupply is lower than 2.5 V, then the device may not be able to switch to the supply quickly enough, and the\ndevice will reset and turn on with soft start timing if VOUT < 1 V.www.ti.comTPS2116\nSLVSFG1A – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2116\n7.5 Output Voltage Drop\nThe output voltage drop during switchover from one supply to another is based on the load capacitance and load\nresistance. The stronger the resistive load, the faster the output will discharge. The higher the capacitance on\nthe output, the less the voltage will drop during switchover.\n7.6 Device Functional Modes\nThe below sections detail the two different configuraiton options for the device.\n7.6.1 Priority/Manual Mode\nWhen MODE is tied high, PR1 determines the channel selected. To configure VIN1 as the priority supply,\nconnect MODE to VIN1 and set the proper threshold through a resistor divider from VIN1 to PR1. To configure\nmanual selection, pull up MODE to an external supply and follow the truth table. When PR1 is pulled above\nVREF, the voltage on VIN1 is used to power the output, and when it is pulled below V REF, VIN2 is used to power\nthe output. The expected behavior for the device is shown in the waveform below.\nFigure 7-2. Priority/Manual Mode Switching\nWhen PR1 is toggled, the device implements a break-before-make switchover which shuts off both channels\nbefore turning on the new channel to power the output. This means that for time t SW, the output is unpowered\nand will dip depending on the load current and output capacitance. If the output voltage is greater than the input\nsupply being switched to, then the device will not turn on the new channel until the output has discharged down\nto V IN + V RCB to prevent reverse current flow.\nWhen MODE is pulled low and PR1 is pulled high, the device enters shutdown. Both channels are turned off and\nthe output is high impedance. When the PR1 pin is pulled low, the higher voltage supply between VIN1 and VIN2\nis passed to the output.\n7.6.1.1 Priority Switching\nIn the case where VIN1 takes priority over VIN2, a resistor divider can be used to set the switchover voltage\nthreshold. When VIN1 is first applied, PR1 is brought high and VOUT is powered by that input. As VIN1 beginsTPS2116\nSLVSFG1A – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2116\nto drop, the voltage on PR1 is lowered until it crosses the V REF threshold. At this point, the device switches over\nto VIN2.\n7.6.1.2 Manual Switching\nFor applications where a GPIO pin is used to select which input passes to the output, the GPIO pin can be\ndirectly connected to the PR1 pin when MODE is tied high ( ≥1V). When the GPIO is pulled high, VIN1 is used,\nand when the GPIO pin is pulled low, VIN2 is used.\nManual mode can also disable both channels by pulling the MODE pin low and keeping PR1 high. In this state,\nthe output of the device is high impedance and the leakage on each input is the shutdown current, I SD,VINx .www.ti.comTPS2116\nSLVSFG1A – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2116\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification,\nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for\ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThis section highlights some of the design considerations when implementing this device in various applications.\n8.2 Typical Application\nThis typical application demonstrates how the TPS2116 device can be used to control inrush current for high\noutput capacitances.\nFigure 8-1. TPS2116 Typical Application Diagram\n8.2.1 Design Requirements\nFor this example, the values below are used as the design parameters.\nTable 8-1. Design Parameters\nPARAMETER VALUE\nVIN1 Input Voltage 5 V\nMode Priority\nOutput Capacitance 100 µF\nMaximum Inrush Current 500 mATPS2116\nSLVSFG1A – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2116\n8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nTo determine how much inrush current is caused by the output capacitor, use the equation below.\nIINRUSH  = C OUT × V OUT / tSS (1)\nwhere\n• I INRUSH  = amount of inrush current caused by C OUT\n• C OUT = capacitance on VOUT\n• t SS = output voltage soft start time\n• V OUT = final value of the output voltage\nWith a final output voltage of 5 V, the expected rise time is 1.7 ms. Using the inrush current equation, the inrush\ncurrent caused by a 100-µF capacitance would be 294 mA, well below the 500-mA target.\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nThe below oscilloscope capture shows 5 V being applied to VIN1. The output comes up with slew rate control\nand limits the inrush current to below 500 mA.\nFigure 8-2.

The VIN power supplies must be well\nregulated and placed as close to the device terminals as possible. The power supplies must be able to withstand\nall transient load current steps. In most situations, using an input capacitance (C IN) of 1 μF is sufficient to prevent\nthe supply voltage from dipping when the switch is turned on. In cases where the power supply is slow to\nrespond to a large transient current or large load current step, additional bulk capacitance may be required on\nthe input.TPS2116\nSLVSFG1A – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2116\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nFor best performance, all traces must be as short as possible. To be most effective, the input and output\ncapacitors must be placed close to the device to minimize the effects that parasitic trace inductances may have\non normal operation. Using wide traces for VIN1, VIN2, VOUT, and GND helps minimize the parasitic electrical\neffects.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 10-1.
