#### Description:
The **EL3H4-G series** is a 4-pin phototransistor optocoupler that features two infrared emitting diodes connected in inverse parallel, optically coupled to a phototransistor. It is designed to provide electrical isolation between its input and output, making it suitable for interfacing between high-voltage and low-voltage circuits. The component is encapsulated in a green compound, indicating its compliance with environmental standards.

#### Typical Applications:
The EL3H4 phototransistor optocoupler is commonly used in:
- **AC line monitoring:** To detect and isolate AC signals.
- **Programmable controllers:** For interfacing control signals while maintaining isolation.
- **Telephone line interfaces:** To safely connect telephone lines to other circuitry.
- **Unknown polarity DC sensors:** To detect and isolate signals from sensors with unknown polarity.

This component is particularly useful in applications where electrical isolation is critical for safety and performance, such as in power management systems and signal processing circuits.
