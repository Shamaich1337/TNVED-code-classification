The integrated main switch in both regulators enables \ngeneration of an adjustable  positive output voltage up to + 39 V \nand a negative output voltage down to − 39 V below input voltage.  \nThe ADP5071 operates at a pin selected 1. 2 MHz/ 2.4 MHz \nswitching frequency. The ADP5071 can synchronize with an \nexternal oscillator from 1.0 MHz to 2.6 MHz to ease no ise \nfilter ing in sensitive applications. Both regulators implement \nprogrammable slew rate control circuitry for the MOSFET driver stage to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI).  \nFlexible start -up sequencing is provided with the options of \nmanual enable, simultaneous mode, positive supply first, and \nnegative supply first.  The ADP5071 includes a fixed internal or resistor programmable  \nsoft start timer to prevent inrush current at power -up. During \nshutdown, both regulators completely disconnect the loads from  \nthe input supply to provide a true shutdown.  \nOther key saf ety features in the ADP5071 include overcurrent \nprotection (OCP), over voltage protection (OVP), thermal \nshutdown (TSD), and inp ut undervoltage lockout (UVLO).   \nThe ADP5071 is available in a 20 -lead LFCSP or in a 20 -lead \nTSSOP and is rated for a − 40°C to +125° C jun ction temperature \nrange.   \nTable 1.

Functional Block Diagram \nPWM MODE \nThe boost and inverting regulators in the ADP5071  operate at a \nfixed frequency set by an internal oscillator. At the start of each \noscillator cycle, the MOSFET switch turns on, applying a positive \nvoltage across the inductor. The inductor current increases until the current sense signal crosses the peak inductor current threshold that turns off the MOSFET switch; this threshold is set by the error amplifier output. During the MOSFET off time, the inductor \ncurrent declines through the external diode until the next \noscillator clock pulse starts a new cycle. It regulates the output voltage by adjusting the peak inductor current threshold.  \nPSM MODE \nDuring light load operation, the regulators can skip pulses to maintain output voltage regulation. Skipping pulses increases the device efficiency. \nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT (UVLO) \nThe undervoltage lockout circuitry monitors the PVINSYS pin voltage level. If the input voltage drops below the V\nUVLO_FALLING  \nthreshold, both regulators turn off. After the PVINSYS pin voltage rises above the V\nUVLO_RISING  threshold, the soft start period initiates, \nand the regulators are enabled. \nOSCILLATOR AND SYNCHRONIZATION \nThe ADP5071  initiates the drive of the boost regulator SW1 pin \nand the inverting regulator SW2 pin 180° out of phase to reduce peak current consumption and noise. A phase-locked loop (PLL)-based oscillator generates the internal \nclock and offers a choice of two internally generated frequency \noptions or external clock synchronization. The switching frequency \nis configured using the SYNC/FREQ pin options shown in Table 6. \nFor external synchronization, connect the SYNC/FREQ pin to a \nsuitable clock source. The PLL locks to an input clock within the range specified by f\nSYNC.  \nTable 6. SYNC/FREQ Pin Options \nSYNC/FREQ Pin Switching Frequency \nHigh 2.4 MHz \nLow 1.2 MHz \nExternal Clock 1 × clock frequency \n \nINTERNAL REGULATORS \nThe internal VREG regulator in the ADP5071  provides a stable \npower supply for the internal circuitry. The VREG supply can be used to provide a logic high signal for device configuration pins but \nmust not be used to supply external circuitry.  \nThe VREF regulator provides a reference voltage for the inverting \nregulator feedback network to ensure a positive feedback voltage on the FB2 pin. \nA current-limit circuit is included for both regulators to protect the \ncircuit from accidental loading. \n \nData Sheet  ADP5071  \n \nRev. E | Page 15 of 27 PRECISION ENABLING  \nThe ADP5071 has an individual enable pin for the boost and \ninverting  regulator s: EN1 and EN2. The enable  pins feature a \nprecision enable circuit with an accurate reference vol tage. This \nreference allows the ADP5071 to be sequenced easily from other \nsupplies. It can also be used as a programmable UVLO input by \nusing a resistor divider.   \nThe enable  pins have an internal pull -down resistor that defaults \neach regulator  to off when the pin is floating.  \nWhen the voltage at the enable pins is greater than the VTH_H \nreference level, the regulator is enabled.  \nSOFT START  \nEach  regulator in the ADP5071 includes soft start circuitry that \nramps the output voltage in a controlled manner during startup, \nthereby limiting the inrush current. The soft start time is internally \nset to the fastest  rate when the SS pin is open .  \nConnecting a resistor between SS and AGND allows the adjust -\nment of the soft start delay. The delay length is common to  both \nregulators.  \nSLEW RATE  CONTROL  \nThe ADP5071 empl oys programmable output driver slew rate \ncontrol circuitry . This circuitry reduce s the  slew rate  of the \nswitching node  as shown in  Figure 41, resulting in  reduced \nringing and lower EMI. To p rogram the slew rate , connect the \nSLEW pin to the VREG  pin for normal mode, to the AGND  pin \nfor slow mode , or leav e it open  for fast mode. This configuration \nallows the use of an open -drain output from a noise sensitive \ndevice to switch the slew rate from fast to slow , for example, \nduring analog -to-digital converter (ADC) sampling.  \nNote that slew rate control causes a trade -off between efficiency \nand low EMI.  \nFASTEST\nSLOWEST\n12069-040 \nFigure 41. Switching Node at Variou s Slew Rate Settings  \n \n \n \n \n CURRENT -LIMIT PROTEC TION  \nThe boost and inverting regulators in the ADP5071  include \ncurrent -limit protection circuitry  to limit the amount of forward \ncurrent through the MOSFET switch.  \nWhen the peak inductor current exceeds the overcurrent limit \nthreshold for a number of clock cycles during an overload or \nshort -circuit condition, the regulator enters hiccup mode. T he \nregulator stops switching and then restarts with a new soft start \ncycle after t HICCUP  and repeats until the overcurrent condition is \nremoved.  \nOVER VOLTAGE PROTECTION  \nAn overvoltage protection mechanism is present on the FB1 and FB2 pin s for the boost and inverting r egulators.  \nOn the boost regulator, when the voltage on the FB1 pin exceeds  \nthe V\nOV1 threshold, the switching on SW1  stops until the voltage \nfalls below the threshold again. This functionality is permanently \nenabled on this regulator.  \nOn the inverting regulator, when the voltage on the FB2 pin \ndrops below the V OV2 threshold, the switching stop s until the \nvoltage rises above the threshold. This functionality is enabled after  the soft start period has elapsed . \nTHERMAL SHUTDOWN  \nIn the event that the ADP5071 junction temperature rises above \nTSHDN, the thermal shutdown circuit turns off the IC. Extreme \njunctio n temperatures can be the result of prolonged high current \noperation, poor circuit board d esign, and/o r high ambient temper -\nature. Hysteresis is included so that when thermal shutdown occurs, \nthe ADP5071 does not return to operation until the on -chip \ntemperature drops below TSHDN minus T HYS. When resuming from \nthermal shutdown, a soft start is performed on each enabled \nchannel.  \nSTART -UP SEQUENCE  \nThe ADP5071 implement s a flexible  start -up sequence to meet \ndifferent system requirements. Three different enabling modes \ncan be implemented via the SEQ pin , as explained in Table 7. \nTable 7. SEQ Pin Settings  \nSEQ Pin Description  \nOpen  Manual enable mode  \nVREG  Simultaneous enable mode  \nLow Sequential enable mode  \n \nTo configure the manual enable mode , leave  the SEQ pin open. \nThe boost and i nverting regulators are controlled separately from \ntheir respective precision enable pins.   \nADP5071 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 16 of 27 To configure the simultaneous enable mode, connect the SEQ pin \nto the VREG pin. Both regulators power up simultaneously when the EN2 pin is taken high.

E | Page 18 of 27 Output Capacitor s \nHigher output capacitor values reduce the output voltage ripple \nand improve load transient response. When choosing this value, it is also important to account for the loss of capacitance due to the output voltage dc bias.  \nCeramic capacitors  are manufacture d with a variety of dielectrics , \neach with a different behavior over temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have a dielectric adequate to ensure the \nminimum capacitance over the necessary temperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R diele ctrics with a voltage rating of \n25 V or 50 V (depending on output) are recommended for best \nperformance. Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are not recommended \nfor use with any dc -to-dc converter because of their poor \ntemperature and dc bias characteristics.  \nCalculat e the worst -case capacitance accounting for capacitor \nvariation over temperature, component tolerance, and voltage \nusing the following equation:  \nC\nEFFECTIVE  = C NOMINAL  × (1 − TEMPCO ) × (1  − DCBIASCO ) ×  \n(1 − Tolerance ) \nwhere:  \nCEFFECTIVE  is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage.  \nCNOMINAL  is the nominal data sheet capacitance.  \nTEMPCO  is the worst -case capacitor temperature coefficient.  \nDCBIASCO  is the dc bias derating at the output voltage.  \nTolerance  is the worst -case component tolerance.  \nTo gu arantee the performance of the device, it is imperative that \nthe effects of dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on the \nbehavior  of the capacitors be evaluated for each application.  \nCapacitors with lower effective series resistance (ESR) and \neffective seri es inductance (ESL) are preferred to minimize  \noutput voltage ripple.  \nNote that the us e of large output capacitors can  require a slower \nsoft start to prevent current limit duri ng startup. A 10 µF  capacitor \nis suggested as a good balance between performance and size.  \nInput Capacitor  \nHigher value input capacitors help to reduce the input voltage ripple and improve transient response.  \nTo minimize supply noise, place the input capacitor as close as \npossible to the PVINSYS pin, PVIN1 pin, and PVIN2 pin. A low ESR capacitor is recommended.  \nThe effective capacitance needed for stability is a minimum of 10  µF. \nIf the power pins are individually decoupled, it is  recommended \nto use an effective minimum of a  5.6 µF capacitor on the PVIN1 \nand PVIN2 pins and a 3.3 µF capacitor on the PVINSYS  pin. The  \nminimum values specified exclude dc bias, temperature, and tolerance effects that are application dependent and must be taken into consideration.  \nVREG Capacitor  \nA 1.0 µF ceramic capacitor (C VREG) is required between the VRE G \npin and AGND.  VREF Capacitor  \nA 1.0 µF ceramic capacitor (C VREF) is required between the VREF \npin and AGND.  \nSoft Start Resistor  \nA resistor can be conne cted between t he SS pin and the AGND p in \nto increase the soft start time. The soft start time can be set by the \nresistor between 4  ms (268 k Ω) and 32 ms (50 k Ω). Leaving the \nSS pin open select s the fastest time of 4 ms . Figure  44 shows the \nbehavior of this operation. Calculate the soft start time using the following formula:  \nt\nSS = 38.4 × 10−3 − 1.28 × 10−7 × RSS (Ω)  \nwhere 50 kΩ ≤ R SS ≤ 268 k Ω. \nSS PIN OPENSOFT START\nTIMER\nSOFT START\nRESISTORR1 R232ms\n4ms\n12069-043 \nFigure 44. Soft Start Behavior  \nDiodes  \nA Schottky diode with low junction capacitance is recommended \nfor D1 and D2. At higher output voltages and especially at higher \nswitching frequencies, the junction capacitance is a significant \ncontributor to efficiency.  Higher capacitance diodes also generate \nmore switching noi se. As a guide, a diode with less than 40 pF \njunction capacitance is preferred whe n the output voltage is \nabove  5 V. \nInductor Selection for the Boost Regulator  \nThe inductor stores energy during the on time of the power \nswitch, and  transfers that energy to the output through the \noutput rectifier during the off time. To balance the tradeoffs \nbetween small inductor current ripple and efficiency, inductance values in the range of 1 µH to 22 µH are recommended. In general,  \nlower inducta nce values have higher saturation current and \nlower  series resistance for a given physical size. However, lower \ninductance results in a higher peak current that can lead to reduced  \nefficiency and greater input and/or output ripple and noise.

E | Page 26 of 27 LAYOUT CONSIDERATION S \nLayout is important for all switching regulators but is particularly \nimportant for regulators with high switching frequencies. To \nachieve  high efficiency, good regulation, good stability , and low \nnoise, a well -designed  PCB layout is required. Follow these \nguideli nes when designing PCB s: \n• Keep the input bypass capacitor, C IN1, close to the PVIN1  pin, \nthe PVIN2  pin, and the PVINSYS pin . Route each of these \npins individually to the pad of this capacitor to minimize noise \ncoupling between the power input s rather than connecting  the \nthree pins at the device. A separate capacitor can be used on \nthe PVINSYS  pin for the best noise performance.  \n• Keep the high current paths as short as possible. Th ese \npaths include  the connections between CIN1, L1, L2, D1, \nD2, COUT1, COUT2 , and PGND and their connections to \nthe ADP5071.  \n• Keep AGND and PGND separate on the top layer of the \nboard. This separation avoids pollution of AGND with \nswitching noise. Do not connect PGND to the  EPAD on \nthe top layer of the layout. Connect both AGND and PGND  \nto the board ground plane with  vias. Ideally, connect PGND \nto the plane at a point between the input and output \ncapacitors. Connect the EPAD on its own to this ground layer with vias and conn ect AGND as near to the pin as \npossible between the CVREF and C VREG capacitors . \n• Keep high current traces as short and wide as possible to minimize parasitic series inductance, which causes spiking and electromagnetic interference (EMI).  \n• Avoid routing high impedance traces near any node con -\nnected to the SW1 and SW2 pins or near Inductors L1and L2 to prevent radiated switching  noise injection.  \n• Place the feedback resistors as close to the FB1 and FB2  pins as \npossible to prevent high frequency switching  noise  injection.  \n• Place the top of the upper feedback resistor s, RFT1 and RFT2, \nor route traces to them from as close as possible to the top of COUT1 and  COUT2 for optimum output voltage sensing.  \n• Place the compensation components as close as possible to COMP1 a nd COMP2. Do not share vias to the ground  \nplane with the feedback resistors to avoid coupling high frequency noise into the sensitive COMP 1 and COMP2  pins. \n• Place the CVREF and CVREG c apacitors  as close to the \nVREG and VREF pins as possible. Ensure that short traces \nare used between VREF and R\nFB2. \n16mm20mm\n12068-049 \nFigure 50.
