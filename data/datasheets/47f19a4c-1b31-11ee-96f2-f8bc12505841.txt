C –4–TERMINOLOGY\nRelative Accuracy (Linearity)\nRelative accuracy, or endpoint linearity, is a measure of the\nmaximum deviation of the DAC transfer function from a\nstraight line passing through the endpoints. It is measured after\nallowing for zero and full-scale errors and is expressed in LSBsor as a percentage of full-scale reading.\nDifferential Nonlinearity\nDifferential nonlinearity is the difference between the measuredchange and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacentcodes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB or less\nover the operating temperature range ensures monotonicity.\nZero Code Offset Error\nZero code offset error is the error in output voltage from V OUTA\nor V OUTB with all 0s loaded into the DAC latches. It is due to a\ncombination of the DAC leakage current and offset errors in theoutput amplifier.\nGain Error\nGain error is a measure of the output error between an ideal\nDAC and the actual device output with all 1s loaded. It does\nnot include offset error.\nTotal Harmonic Distortion\nThis is the ratio of the root-mean-square (rms) sum of the har-\nmonics to the fundamental, expressed in dBs.\nMultiplying Feedthrough Error\nThis is an ac error due to capacitive feedthrough from the V REF\ninput to V OUT of the same DAC when the DAC latch is loaded\nwith all 0s.Channel-to-Channel Isolation\nThis is an ac error due to capacitive feedthrough from the V REF\ninput on one DAC to V OUT on the other DAC. It is measured\nwith the DAC latches loaded with all 0s.\nDigital Feedthrough\nDigital feedthrough is the glitch impulse injected from the digi-\ntal inputs to the analog output when the data inputs change state,\nbut the data in the DAC latches is not changed.\nFor the AD7837, it is measured with LDAC  held high. For the\nAD7847, it is measured with CSA and CSB held high.\nDigital Crosstalk\nDigital crosstalk is the glitch impulse transferred to the output\nof one converter due to a change in digital code on the DAC\nlatch of the other converter. It is specified in nV secs.\nDigital-to-Analog Glitch Impulse\nThis is the voltage spike that appears at the output of the DAC\nwhen the digital code changes, before the output settles to its\nfinal value. The energy in the glitch is specified in nV secs and ismeasured for a 1 LSB change around the major carry transition\n(0111 1111 1111 to 1000 0000 0000 and vice versa).\nUnity Gain Small Signal Bandwidth\nThis is the frequency at which the small signal voltage output\nfrom the output amplifier is 3 dB below its dc level. It is mea-\nsured with the DAC latch loaded with all 1s.\nFull Power Bandwidth\nThis is the maximum frequency for which a sinusoidal input\nsignal will produce full output at rated load with a distortion\nless than 3%. It is measured with the DAC latch loaded with\nall 1s.\nAD7837 PIN FUNCTION DESCRIPTION (DIP AND SOIC PIN NUMBERS)\nPin Mnemonic Description\n1 CS Chip Select. Active low logic input.

C –7–CIRCUIT INFORMATION\nD/A SECTION\nA simplified circuit diagram for one of the D/A converters and\noutput amplifier is shown in Figure 10.\nA segmented scheme is used whereby the 2 MSBs of the 12-bit\ndata word are decoded to drive the three switches A-C. Theremaining 10 bits drive the switches (S0–S9) in a standard R-2R\nladder configuration.\nEach of the switches A–C steers 1/4 of the total reference cur-\nrent with the remaining 1/4 passing through the R-2R section.\nThe output amplifier and feedback resistor perform the current\nto voltage conversion giving\nV\nOUT = – D × VREF\nwhere D is the fractional representation of the digital word. ( D\ncan be set from 0 to 4095/4096.)\nThe output amplifier can maintain ±10 V across a 2 k Ω load. It\nis internally compensated and settles to 0.01% FSR (1/2 LSB)\nin less than 5 µs.

It can be treatedas two independent DACs, each with its own CS input and a com-\nmon WR input. CSA  and WR control the loading of data to the\nDAC A latch, while CSB and WR control the loading of the\nDAC B latch. The latches are edge triggered so that input data\nis latched to the respective latch on the rising edge of WR. If CSA\nand CSB are both low and WR is taken high, the same data will\nbe latched to both DAC latches.

Thepart contains two 12-bit latches per DAC—an input latch and\na DAC latch. Each input latch is further subdivided into a least-\nsignificant 8-bit latch and a most-significant 4-bit latch. Only the\ndata held in the DAC latches determines the outputs from the part.\nThe input control logic for the AD7837 is shown in Figure 13,\nwhile the write cycle timing diagram is shown in Figure 14.\nDAC A MS\nINPUT\nLATCH12\nDAC A LS\nINPUT\nLATCH4\n8\nDAC B LS\nINPUT\nLATCH\nDAC B LS\nINPUT\nLATCH12\n4\n8\n8CS\nWRDAC A\nLATCHLDAC\nA0\nA1\nDB7  DB0DAC B\nLATCH\nFigure 13.

Data\ncan be loaded to the input latches in any sequence. Provided that\nLDAC  is held high, there is no analog output change as a result\nof loading data to the input latches. Address lines A0 and A1determine which latch data is loaded to when CS and WR are low.\nThe control logic truth table for the part is shown in Table II.\nTable II.

When LDAC  is taken low, both\nDAC latches, and hence both analog outputs, are updated atthe same time. The data in the DAC latches is held on the rising\nedge of LDAC . The LDAC  input is asynchronous and indepen-\ndent of WR. This is useful in many applications especially in the\nsimultaneous updating of multiple AD7837s. However, care mustbe taken while exercising LDAC  during a write cycle. If an LDAC\noperation overlaps a CS and WR operation, there is a possibility\nof invalid data being latched to the output. To avoid this, LDAC\nmust remain low after CS or WR return high for a period equal\nto or greater than t\n8, the minimum LDAC  pulsewidth.UNIPOLAR BINARY OPERATION\nFigure 15 shows DAC A on the AD7837/AD7847 connected\nfor unipolar binary operation.

C –9–APPLICATIONS\nPROGRAMMABLE GAIN AMPLIFIER (PGA)\nThe dual DAC/amplifier combination along with access to R FB\nmake the AD7837 ideal as a programmable gain amplifier. In this\napplication, the DAC functions as a programmable resistor in theamplifier feedback loop. This type of configuration is shownin Figure 17 and is suitable for ac gain control. The circuit con-\nsists of two PGAs in series. Use of a dual configuration providesgreater accuracy over a wider dynamic range than a single PGAsolution. The overall system gain is the product of the individual\ngain stages. The effective gains for each stage are controlled by\nthe DAC codes. As the code decreases, the effective DACresistance increases, and so the gain also increases.\nDAC BAGNDA\nVOUTBVREFBVIN\nRFBBAD7837\nVOUTRFBA\nAGNDBDAC A\nVOUTAVREFA\nFigure 17.

Power Variation for Circuit in Figure 9\nAPPLYING THE AD7837/AD7847\nGeneral Ground Management\nAC or transient voltages between the analog and digital grounds\ni.e., between AGNDA/AGNDB and DGND can cause noise\ninjection into the analog output. The best method of ensuring\nthat both AGNDs and DGND are equal is to connect themtogether at the AD7837/AD7847 on the circuit board. In more\ncomplex systems where the AGND and DGND intertie is on the\nbackplane, it is recommended that two diodes be connected ininverse parallel between the AGND and DGND pins (1N914 or\nequivalent).\nPower Supply Decoupling\nIn order to minimize noise it is recommended that the V DD and\nthe V SS lines on the AD7837/AD7847 be decoupled to DGND\nusing a 10 µ F in parallel with a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor.\nOperation with Reduced Power Supply Voltages\nThe AD7837/AD7847 is specified for operation with V DD/VSS =\n±15 V ± 5%. The part may be operated down to V DD/VSS =\n±10 V without significant linearity degradation. See typical\nperformance graphs. The output amplifier however requires\napproximately 3 V of headroom so the V REF input should not\napproach within 3 V of either power supply voltages in order tomaintain accuracy.\nMICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING–AD7847\nFigures 20 to 22 show interfaces between the AD7847 and threepopular 16-bit microprocessor systems, the 8086, MC68000 and\nthe TMS320C10. In all interfaces, the AD7847 is memory-\nmapped with a separate memory address for each DAC latch.\nAD7847–8086 Interface\nFigure 20 shows an interface between the AD7847 and the 8086\nmicroprocessor. A single MOV instruction loads the 12-bit word\ninto the selected DAC latch and the output responds on the ris-ing edge of WR.ANALOG PANNING CIRCUIT\nIn audio applications it is often necessary to digitally “pan” or\nsplit a single signal source into a two-channel signal while main-\ntaining the total power delivered to both channels constant. This\nmay be done very simply by feeding the signal into the V REF\ninput of both DACs. The digital codes are chosen such that the\ncode applied to DAC B is the two's complement of that applied\nto DAC A. In this way the signal may be panned between bothchannels as the digital code is changed. The total power varia-\ntion with this arrangement is 3 dB.\nFor applications which require more precise power control the\ncircuit shown in Figure 18 may be used. This circuit  requires\nthe AD7837/AD7847, an AD712 dual op amp and eight equal\nvalue resistors.\nAgain both channels are driven with two's complementary data.\nThe maximum power variation using this circuit is only 0.5 dBs.\nVOUTAVREFA\nVIN\nRLBAD7837/\nAD78471/2\nAD712\nRR R\nR\nR R\nR R1/2\nAD712\nRLAVOUTBVOUTA\nVOUTB\nVREFB\nFigure 18.

The total power variation as the signal is fully panned from\nChannel B to Channel A is shown in Figure 19.\nAD7837/AD7847\nREV. C –11–MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING–AD7837\nFigures 23 to 25 show the AD7837 configured for interfacing to\nmicroprocessors with 8-bit data bus systems. In all cases, data isright-justified and the AD7837 is memory-mapped with the two\nlowest address lines of the microprocessor address bus driving\nthe A0 and A1 inputs of the AD7837. Five separate memoryaddresses are required, one for the each MS latch and one for\neach LS latch and one for the common LDAC  input. Data is\nwritten to the respective input latch in two write operations.\nEither high byte or low byte data can be written first to the\ninput latch. A write to the AD7837 LDAC  address transfers the\ndata from the input latches to the respective DAC latches and\nupdates both analog outputs. Alternatively, the LDAC  input\ncan be asynchronous and can be common to several AD7837sfor simultaneous updating of a number of voltage channels.\nAD7837–8051/8088 Interface\nFigure 23 shows the connection diagram for interfacing the\nAD7837 to both the 8051 and the 8088.
