The small package \nis ideal for space constrained applications while also saving \ncosts due to reduced board area. Typical applications include \nmotor control, load detection and management, switched-mode \npower supplies, and overcurrent fault protection.\nThe device consists of a precise, low-offset, linear Hall \nsensor circuit with a copper conduction path located near the \nsurface of the die. Applied current flowing through this copper \nconduction path generates a magnetic field which is sensed by \nthe integrated Hall IC and converted into a proportional voltage. \nDevice accuracy is optimized through the close proximity of the \nmagnetic field to the Hall transducer. A precise, proportional \nvoltage is provided by the low-offset, chopper-stabilized \nBiCMOS Hall IC, which includes Allegro’s patented digital \ntemperature compensation, resulting in extremely accurate \nperformance over temperature. The output of the device has \na positive slope when an increasing current flows through the \nprimary copper conduction path (from pins 1 and 2, to pins 3 \nand 4), which is the path used for current sensing. The internal \nresistance of this conductive path is 0.65 mΩ typical, providing \nlow power loss.\nThe terminals of the conductive path are electrically isolated \nfrom the sensor leads (pins 5 through 8). This allows the \nACS722 current sensor IC to be used in high-side current sense \napplications without the use of high-side differential amplifiers \nor other costly isolation techniques.\nThe ACS722 is provided in a small, low profile surface mount \nSOIC8 package. The leadframe is plated with 100% matte tin, \nACS722-DS, Rev. 6\nMCO-0000537• Patented integrated digital temperature compensation \ncircuitry allows for near closed loop accuracy over \ntemperature in an open loop sensor \n• UL60950-1 (ed. 2) certified\n □Dielectric Strength V oltage = 2.4 kVrms\n □Basic Isolation Working V oltage = 420 Vpk/297  \nVrms\n• Industry-leading noise performance with greatly \nimproved bandwidth through proprietary amplifier and \nfilter design techniques\n• Pin-selectable band width: 80 kHz for high bandwidth \napplications or 20 kHz for low noise performance\n• 0.65 mΩ primary conductor resistance for low power \nloss and high inrush current withstand capability\n• Small footprint, low-profile SOIC8 package suitable for \nspace-constrained applications\n• Integrated shield virtually eliminates capacitive  coupling \nfrom current conductor to die, greatly suppressing output \nnoise due to high dv/dt transients\n• 3 to 3.6 V , single supply operationHigh Accuracy, Galvanically Isolated Current Sensor IC\nwith Small Footprint SOIC8 Package\nContinued on the next page…Package: 8-pin SOIC (suff\u200aix LC)\nTypical Application\nP\nPP\nLCBYPASS\n0.1 µFACS722\nC21\n3\n468\n57IP+ VCC\n–I+I\nIP+ VIOUT\nIP–\nIP–BW_SEL\nGNDIThe ACS722 outputs an analog \nsignal, VIOUT , that changes, \nproportionally, with the \nbidirectional AC or DC primary \nsensed current, IP , within \nthe specified measurement \nrange.

(Sens)\nThe change in sensor IC output in response to a 1 A change \nthrough the primary conductor. The sensitivity is the product of \nthe magnetic circuit sensitivity (G / A) (1 G = 0.1 mT)and the \nlinear IC amplifier gain (mV/G). The linear IC amplifier gain is \nprogrammed at the factory to optimize the sensitivity (mV/A) for \nthe full-scale current of the device.\nNonlinearity (ELIN)\nThe nonlinearity is a measure of how linear the output of the sen -\nsor IC is over the full current measurement range. The nonlinear -\nity is calculated as:\n1– [{ [{VIOUT (IPR(max))  –  VIOUT(Q)× 100 (%)ELIN =2 × V IOUT (IPR(max)/2)  –VIOUT(Q)  \nwhere VIOUT(IPR(max)) is the output of the sensor IC with the \nmaximum measurement current flowing through it and \nVIOUT(IPR(max)/2) is the output of the sensor IC with half of the \nmaximum measurement current flowing through it.\nZero Current Output Voltage (VIOUT(Q) )\nThe output of the sensor when the primary current is zero.  For \na unipolar supply voltage, it nominally remains at 0.5 × VCC for \na bidirectional device and 0.1 × VCC for a unidirectional device. \nFor example, in the case of a bidirectional output device, VCC = \n3.3 V translates into VIOUT(Q)  = 1.65 V . Variation in VIOUT(Q) can \nbe attributed to the resolution of the Allegro linear IC quiescent \nvoltage trim and thermal drift.\nOffset Voltage (VOE)\nThe deviation of the device output from its ideal quiescent value \nof 0.5 × VCC (bidirectional) or 0.1 × VCC (unidirectional) due to \nnonmagnetic causes.

However, the sensor cannot \ndifferentiate between fields created by the current flow and exter -\nnal magnetic fields. This means that external magnetic fields can \ncause errors in the output of the sensor. Magnetic fields which are \nperpendicular to the surface of the package affect the output of \nthe sensor, as it only senses fields in that one plane. The error in \nAmperes can be quantified as:\nError(B) =B\nCF\nwhere B is the strength of the external field perpendicular to the surface of the package in Gauss, and CF is the coupling factor in \nG/A. Then, multiplying by the sensitivity of the part, Sens, gives \nthe error in mV . \nFor example, an external field of 1 Gauss will result in around \n0.1 A of error. If the ACS722LLCTR-10AB, which has a nominal \nsensitivity of 132 mV/A, is being used, that equates to 13.2 mV \nof error on the output of the sensor.\nExternal Field \n(Gauss)Error (A)Error (mV)\n5AB 10AB 20AB 40AB\n0.5 0.05 13.2 6.6 3.3 1.65\n1 0.1 26.4 13.2 6.6 3.3\n2 0.2 52.8 26.4 13.2 6.6APPLICATION INFORMATION\nHigh Accuracy, Galvanically Isolated Current Sensor IC\nwith Small Footprint SOIC8 PackageACS72220\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comThermal Rise vs. Primary Current\nSelf-heating due to the flow of current should be considered dur -\ning the design of any current sensing system. The sensor, printed \ncircuit board (PCB), and contacts to the PCB will generate heat as \ncurrent moves through the system. \nThe thermal response is highly dependent on PCB layout, copper \nthickness, cooling techniques, and the profile of the injected current. \nThe current profile includes peak current, current “on-time”, and \nduty cycle. While the data presented in this section was collected \nwith direct current (DC), these numbers may be used to approximate \nthermal response for both AC signals and current pulses.\nThe plot in Figure 3  shows the measured rise in steady-state die \ntemperature of the ACS722 versus continuous current at an ambi -\nent temperature, TA, of 25 °C. The thermal offset curves may be \ndirectly applied to other values of TA. Conversely, Figure 4  shows \nthe maximum continuous current at a given TA. Surges beyond the \nmaximum current listed in Figure 4  are allowed given the maxi -\nmum junction temperature, TJ(MAX)  (165℃), is not exceeded.\nFigure 3 : Self-Heating in the LC2 Package  \nDue to Current Flow\nFigure 4 : Maximum Continuous Current at a Given TA The thermal capacity of the ACS722 should be verified by the \nend user in the application’s specific conditions.
