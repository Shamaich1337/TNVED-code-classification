A temperaturecompensated Schottky diode peak detector and buffer\namplifier are combined in a small ThinSOT\nTM or (2mm ·\n2mm) DFN package. The supply voltage range is opti-mized for operation from a single lithium-ion cell or 3 ·\nNiMH.\nThe RF input voltage is peak detected using an on-chip\nSchottky diode. The detected voltage is buffered and\nsupplied to the V\nOUT pin.\nThe LTC5532 output buffer gain is set via external resis-\ntors. The initial starting voltage of 120mV –35mV can be\nprecisely adjusted using the V OS pin.\nThe LTC5532 operates with RF input power levels from\n–32dBm to 10dBm.\n, LTC and LT are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation.\n300MHz to 7GHz RF Power Detector\n(SOT-23 Package)Output Voltage vs RF Input Power\n(SOT-23 Package)ThinSOT is a trademark of Linear Technology Corporation.\n*Higher frequency operation is achievable with reduced performance.

These functions include an internal fre-quency compensated buffer amplifier, an RF Schottky di-\node peak detector and a level shift amplifier to convert the\nRF input signal to DC. The LTC5532 has both gain settingand voltage offset adjustment capabilities.\nBuffer Amplifier\nThe output buffer amplifier is capable of supplying typi-\ncally 4mA into a load. The negative terminal V\nM is brought\nout to a pin for gain selection. External resistors connected\nbetween V OUT and V M (RA) and V M to ground (R B) will set\nthe gain of this amplifier.\nGain = 1 + R A/RB\nThe amplifier is unity gain stable; however  a minimum\ngain of two is recommended to improve low output\nvoltage accuracy. The amplifier has a bandwidth of 2MHz\nwith a gain of 2. For increased gain applications, thebandwidth is reduced according to the formula:\nBandwidth = 4MHz/(Gain) = 4MHz • R\nB/(RA + R B)\nA capacitor can be placed across the feedback resistor R A\nto shape the frequency response. In addition, the ampli-\nfier can be used as a comparator. V M can be connected to\na reference voltage. When the internal detector outputvoltage (which is connected to the positive input of the\nbuffer amplifier) exceeds the external voltage on V M, VOUT\nwill switch high.\nThe V OS input controls the DC input voltage to the buffer\namplifier. V OS must be connected to ground if the DC\nstarting voltage is not to be changed. The buffer is initially\ntrimmed nominally to 120mV (Gain = 2x) with V OS con-\nnected to ground.\nThe V OS pin is used to change the initial V OUT starting\nvoltage. This function, in combination with gain adjust-ment enables the LTC5532 output to span the input range\nof a variety of analog-to-digital converters. V\nOUT will not\nchange until V OS exceeds 120mV. The starting voltage at\nVOUT for V OS >120mV is:\nVOUT = 0.5 • V OS • Gain\nwhere gain is the output buffer gain. For a buffer gain of 2x,\nVOUT will exactly track V OS above 120mV.\nRF Detector\nThe internal RF Schottky diode peak detector and level\nshift amplifier convert the RF input signal to a low fre-\nquency signal. The detector demonstrates excellent effi-\nciency and linearity over a wide range of input power. TheSchottky diode is biased at about 55 mA and drives a 25pF\ninternal peak detector capacitor.\nDemo Board Schematic\nRFIN\nGND\nVOSVCC\nVOUT\nVMLTC5532ES6\n1\n236\n54C4\n39pF\nRFIN\nR1(OPT)\nOFFSET\nADJUSTMENTC2\n100pFC1\n0.1µF\nC3\n(OPT)V\nCC\n2.7V TO 6V\nVOUT\nGNDR2\n10k1%\nR3\n10k1%\n5532 DB\nLTC5532\n135532fAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nFigure 2.

The smaller DFN\npackage version is recommended for these applicationsbecause of its lower parasitics. Figure 1 plots the output\nvoltage as a function of RF power of a 12GHz CW input\nsignal.The LTC5532 can be used as a demodulator for AM and\nASK modulated signals with data rates up to 2MHz.\nDepending on specific application needs, the RSSI output\ncan be split between two branches, providing AC-coupleddata (or audio) output and DC-coupled RSSI output for\nsignal strength measurements and AGC.\nThe LTC5532 can be used for RF power detection and\ncontrol. Figure 2 is an example of a transmitter power\ncontroller, using the LTC5532 with a capacitive tap to the\npower amplifier. A 0.5pF capacitor (C1) followed by a200W resistor (R1) form a coupling circuit with about\n20dB loss at 900MHz referenced to the LTC5532 RF input\npin. In the actual product implementation, componentvalues for the capacitive tap may be different depending on\nparts placement, PCB parasitics and parameters of the\nantenna.\nThe LTC5532 can be configured as a comparator for RF\npower detection and RF power alarms.
