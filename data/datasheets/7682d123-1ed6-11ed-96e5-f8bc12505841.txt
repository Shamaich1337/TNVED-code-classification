Input voltage range ofLM27762 isfrom 2.7\nVto5.5V.Five low-cost capacitors areused inthiscircuit toprovide upto±250 mAofoutput current. The\nLM27762 operates at2-MHz (typical) switching frequency toreduce output resistance andvoltage ripple. With an\ntypical operating current ofonly 390 µAand 0.5-µAtypical shutdown current, theLM27762 provides ideal\nperformance forpower amplifiers andDAC bias andother high-current, low-noise negative voltage needs.\nThe LM27762 device has anenable input (EN+) forthepositive LDO and another enable input (EN–)forthe\nnegative charge pump and LDO. This supports independent timing forthepositive and negative rails insystem\npower sequence. Enable inputs can bealso shorted together and connected toVIN. When LDO isdisabled,\noutput ofthepositive LDO has50-kΩpulldown toground, and output ofthenegative LDO has50-kΩpullup to\nground. The LM27762 haspower good monitoring forOUT+ and OUT –outputs.

The charge pump andpositive LDO both have 500mA(typical) input current limit\nwhen theoutput isshorted directly toground. When theLM27762 iscurrent limiting, power dissipation inthe\ndevice islikely tobequite high. Inthisevent, thermal cycling isexpected.\n7.3.3 PFM Operation\nTominimize quiescent current during light load operation, theLM27762 allows PFM orpulse-skipping operation.\nByallowing thecharge pump toswitch less when theoutput current islow, thequiescent current drawn from the\npower source isminimized. The frequency ofpulsed operation isnotlimited and can drop intothesub-2-kHz\nrange when unloaded. Astheload increases, thefrequency ofpulsing increases until ittransitions toconstant\nfrequency. Thefundamental switching frequency intheLM27762 is2MHz.\n7.3.4 Output Discharge\nInshutdown, theLM27762 actively pulls down ontheoutputs (OUT+, OUT –)ofthedevice until theoutput\nvoltage reaches GND.\n7.3.5 Power Good Output (PGOOD)\nTheLM27762 hasmonitoring fortheOUT+ andOUT –output voltage levels andopen-drain PGOOD output.\nTable 1.PGOOD (Active Low) Operation\nEN+ EN– OUT+ OUT– PGOOD\nLow Low Don\'t care Don\'t care High\nHigh Low <95% oftarget value Don\'t care High\nHigh Low >95% oftarget value Don\'t care Low\nLow High Don\'t care <95% oftarget value High\nLow High Don\'t care >95% oftarget value Low\nHigh High <95% oftarget value Don\'t care High\nHigh High Don\'t care <95% oftarget value High\nHigh High >95% oftarget value >95% oftarget value Low\n7.3.6 Thermal Shutdown\nThe LM27762 implements athermal shutdown mechanism toprotect the device from damage due to\noverheating. When thejunction temperature rises to150°C(typical), thedevice switches intoshutdown mode.\nTheLM27762 releases thermal shutdown when thejunction temperature isreduced to130°C(typical).\nThermal shutdown ismost often triggered byself-heating, which occurs when there isexcessive power\ndissipation inthedevice and/or insufficient thermal dissipation. The LM27762 device power dissipation increases\nwith increased output current andinput voltage. When self-heating brings onthermal shutdown, thermal cycling\nisthetypical result. Thermal cycling istherepeating process where thepart self-heats, enters thermal shutdown\n(where internal power dissipation ispractically zero), cools, turns on,and then heats upagain tothethermal\nshutdown threshold. Thermal cycling isrecognized byapulsing output voltage andcanbestopped byreducing\ntheinternal power dissipation (reduce input voltage and/or output current) ortheambient temperature. Ifthermal\ncycling occurs under desired operating conditions, thermal dissipation performance must beimproved to\naccommodate thepower dissipation ofthedevice.\n11LM27762\nwww.ti.com SNVSAF7B –AUGUST 2016 –REVISED FEBRUARY 2017\nProduct Folder Links: LM27762Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2016 –2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Shutdown Mode\nWhen enable pins (EN+, EN–)arelow, both positive and negative outputs ofLM27762 aredisabled, and the\ndevice isinshutdown mode reducing thequiescent current tominimum level. Inshutdown, theoutputs ofthe\nLM27762 arepulled toground (internal 50kΩbetween each OUT pinandground).\n7.4.2 Enable Mode\nApplying avoltage greater than 1.2VtotheEN+ pinenables thepositive LDO. Applying avoltage greater than\n1.2VtotheEN–pinenables thenegative CPand LDO. When enabled, thepositive and negative output\nvoltages areequal tolevels setbyexternal resistors.

The LDO output israted foracurrent of250mA. This negative LDO allows thedevice toprovide avery\nlownoise output, lowoutput voltage ripple, high PSRR, andlowlineorload transient response.\nThe negative output voltage oftheLM27762 isexternally configurable. The value ofR3and R4determines the\noutput voltage setting. Theoutput voltage canbecalculated using Equation 1:\nVOUT=–1.22 V×(R3+R4)/R4 (3)\nThevalue forR4must benoless than 50kΩ.\n8.2.2.5 External Capacitor Selection\nThe LM27762 requires 5external capacitors forproper operation. Surface-mount multi-layer ceramic capacitors\narerecommended. These capacitors aresmall, inexpensive, andhave very lowESR (≤15mΩtypical). Tantalum\ncapacitors, OS-CON capacitors, and aluminum electrolytic capacitors generally arenotrecommended foruse\nwith theLM27762 duetotheir high ESR compared toceramic capacitors.\nFormost applications, ceramic capacitors with anX7R orX5R temperature characteristic arepreferable foruse\nwith theLM27762. These capacitors have tight capacitance tolerances (asgood as±10%) and hold their value\nover temperature (X7R: ±15% over –55°Cto+125 °C;X5R ±15% over –55°Cto+85°C).\n15LM27762\nwww.ti.com SNVSAF7B –AUGUST 2016 –REVISED FEBRUARY 2017\nProduct Folder Links: LM27762Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2016 –2017, Texas Instruments IncorporatedUsing capacitors with aY5V orZ5U temperature characteristic isgenerally notrecommended fortheLM27762.\nThese capacitors typically have wide capacitance tolerance (80%, ….20%) and vary significantly over\ntemperature (Y5V: 22%, –82% over –30°Cto+85°Crange; Z5U: 22%, –56% over 10°Cto85°Crange). Under\nsome conditions a1-µF-rated Y5V orZ5U capacitor could have acapacitance aslow as0.1µF.Such\ndetrimental deviation islikely tocause Y5V and Z5U capacitors tofailtomeet theminimum capacitance\nrequirements oftheLM27762.\nNetcapacitance ofaceramic capacitor decreases with increased DCbias. This degradation canresult inlower-\nthan-expected capacitance ontheinput and/or output, resulting inhigher ripple voltages and currents. Using\ncapacitors atDCbias voltages significantly below thecapacitor voltage rating usually minimizes DCbias effects.\nConsult capacitor manufacturers forinformation oncapacitor DCbias characteristics.\nCapacitance characteristics canvary quite dramatically with different application conditions, capacitor types, and\ncapacitor manufacturers. TIstrongly recommends that theLM27762 circuit beevaluated thoroughly early inthe\ndesign-in process with themass-production capacitor ofchoice. This helps ensure that any such variability in\ncapacitance does notnegatively impact circuit performance.\n8.2.2.5.1 Charge-Pump Output Capacitor\nIntypical applications, Texas Instruments recommends a4.7-µFlow-ESR ceramic charge-pump output capacitor\n(CCP).Different output capacitance values canbeused toreduce charge pump ripple, shrink thesolution size,\nand/or cutthecost ofthesolution. However, changing theoutput capacitor may also require changing theflying\ncapacitor orinput capacitor tomaintain good overall circuit performance.\nInhigher-current applications, a10-µF,10-V low-ESR ceramic output capacitor isrecommended. Ifasmall\noutput capacitor isused, theoutput ripple can become large during thetransition between PFM mode and\nconstant switching. Toprevent toggling, a2-µFcapacitance isrecommended. Forexample, 10-µF,10-V output\ncapacitor ina0402 case size typically hasonly 2-µFcapacitance when biased to5V.\n8.2.2.5.2 Input Capacitor\nThe input capacitor (C2) isareservoir ofcharge that aids inaquick transfer ofcharge from thesupply tothe\nflying capacitors during thecharge phase ofoperation. The input capacitor helps tokeep theinput voltage from\ndrooping atthestart ofthecharge phase when theflying capacitors areconnected totheinput. Italso filters\nnoise ontheinput pin,keeping thisnoise outofthesensitive internal analog circuitry thatisbiased offtheinput\nline.\nInput capacitance hasadominant andfirst-order effect ontheinput ripple magnitude. Increasing (decreasing) the\ninput capacitance results inaproportional decrease (increase) ininput voltage ripple. Input voltage, output\ncurrent, andflying capacitance also affects input ripple levels tosome degree.\nIntypical applications, a4.7-µFlow-ESR ceramic capacitor isrecommended ontheinput. When operating near\nthemaximum load of250mA, after taking intotheDCbias derating, aminimum recommended input capacitance\nis2µForlarger. Different input capacitance values canbeused toreduce ripple, shrink thesolution size, and/or\ncutthecost ofthesolution.\n8.2.2.5.3 Flying Capacitor\nThe flying capacitor (C1)transfers charge from theinput totheoutput. Flying capacitance canimpact both output\ncurrent capability and ripple magnitudes. Ifflying capacitance istoosmall, theLM27762 may notbeable to\nregulate theoutput voltage when load currents arehigh. Ontheother hand, iftheflying capacitance istoolarge,\ntheflying capacitor might overwhelm theinput and charge pump output capacitors, resulting inincreased input\nandoutput ripple.\nIntypical high-current applications, 0.47- µFor1-µF10-V low-ESR ceramic capacitors arerecommended forthe\nflying capacitors. Polarized capacitors (tantalum, aluminum, electrolytic, etc.) must notbeused fortheflying\ncapacitor, asthey could become reverse-biased during LM27762 operation.\n8.2.2.5.4 LDO Output Capacitor\nThe LDO output capacitor (COUT+, COUT-) value andtheESR affect stability, output ripple, output noise, PSRR\nand transient response. The LM27762 only requires theuse ofa2.2-µFceramic output capacitor forstable\noperation. Fortypical applications, a2.2-µFceramic output capacitor located close totheoutput issufficient.\nFrequency(Hz)PSRR (dB)\n10 100 1000 10000 100000-55-50-45-40-35-30-25-20-15-10-50\nD023VIN=3.7V,IOUT=100mA\nVIN=3.7V,IOUT=10mA\nVIN=3.3V,IOUT=10mA\nFrequency (Hz)PSRR (dB)\n10 100 1000 10000 100000-80-70-60-50-40-30-20-100\nD024VIN= 3.7V, IOUT=100mA\nVIN= 3.3V, IOUT=100mA\nVIN= 3.7V, IOUT=10mA\nVIN= 3.3V, IOUT=10mA\n16LM27762\nSNVSAF7B –AUGUST 2016 –REVISED FEBRUARY 2017 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: LM27762Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2016 –2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated8.2.2.6 Power Dissipation\nThe allowed power dissipation foranypackage isameasure oftheability ofthedevice topass heat from the\njunctions ofthedevice totheheatsink and theambient environment. Thus, thepower dissipation isdependent\nontheambient temperature and thethermal resistance across thevarious interfaces between thediejunction\nandambient air.\nThemaximum allowable power dissipation canbecalculated byEquation 4:\nPD-MAX =(TJ-MAX –TA)/RθJA (4)\nTheactual power being dissipated inthedevice canberepresented byEquation 5:\nPD=PIN–POUT=VIN×(–IOUT –+IOUT+ +IQ)–(VOUT+ ×IOUT+ +VOUT –×IOUT –) (5)\nEquation 4and Equation 5establish therelationship between themaximum power dissipation allowed due to\nthermal consideration, thevoltage drop across thedevice, and thecontinuous current capability ofthedevice.\nThese equations must beused todetermine theoptimum operating conditions forthedevice inagiven\napplication.\nInlower power dissipation applications themaximum ambient temperature (TA-MAX )may beincreased. Inhigher\npower dissipation applications themaximum ambient temperature(T A-MAX )may have tobederated. TA-MAX canbe\ncalculated using Equation 6:\nTA-MAX =TJ-MAX-OP –(RθJA×PD-MAX )\nwhere\n•TJ-MAX-OP =maximum operating junction temperature (125°C)\n•PD-MAX =themaximum allowable power dissipation\n•RθJA=junction-to-ambient thermal resistance ofthepackage (6)\nAlternately, ifTA-MAX cannot bederated, thepower dissipation value must bereduced. This canbeaccomplished\nbyreducing theinput voltage aslong astheminimum VINisnotviolated, orbyreducing theoutput current, or\nsome combination ofthetwo.\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nRefer also toTypical Characteristics\nFigure 14.PSRR forOUT- Figure 15.PSRR forOUT+\n17LM27762\nwww.ti.com SNVSAF7B –AUGUST 2016 –REVISED FEBRUARY 2017\nProduct Folder Links: LM27762Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2016 –2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated9Power Supply Recommendations\nThe LM27762 isdesigned tooperate from aninput voltage supply range between 2.7Vand 5.5V.This input\nsupply must bewell regulated andcapable ofsupplying therequired input current.
