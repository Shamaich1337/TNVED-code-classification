When the voltage on the protectedline exceeds the reference voltage (plus diode V\nF) the\nsteering diodes are forward biased, conducting thetransient current away from the sensitive circuitry.Data lines are connected at pins 2 and 3.  The nega-tive reference (REF1) is connected at pin 1.  This pinshould be connected directly to a ground plane on theboard for best results.  The path length is kept as shortas possible to minimize parasitic inductance.The positive reference (REF2) is connected at pin 4.The options for connecting the positive reference areas follows:\nNote that pins 4 is connected internally to the cathode\nof the low voltage TVS. It is not recommended that thispin be directly connected to a DC source greater thanthe snap-back votlage (V\nSB) as the device can latch on\nas described below.\nEPD TVS  Characteristics\nThese devices are constructed using Semtech’s\nproprietary EPD technology.  By utilizing the EPD tech-nology, the SR3.3 can effectively operate at 3.3V whilemaintaining excellent electrical characteristics.\nThe EPD TVS employs a complex nppn structure in\ncontrast to the pn structure normally found in tradi-tional silicon-avalanche TVS diodes.  Since the EPDTVS devices use a 4-layer structure, they exhibit aslightly different IV characteristic curve when comparedto conventional devices.  During normal operation, thedevice represents a high-impedance to the circuit up tothe device working voltage (V\nRWM).  During an ESD\nevent, the device will begin to conduct and will enter alow impedance state when the punch through voltage(V\nPT) is exceeded.  Unlike a conventional device, the low\nvoltage TVS will exhibit a slight negative resistancecharacteristic as it conducts current.  This characteris-tic aids in lowering the clamping voltage of the device,but must be considered in applications where DCvoltages are present.\nWhen the TVS is conducting current, it will exhibit a\nslight “snap-back” or negative resistancecharacteristics due to its structure.  This point is\ndefined on the curve by the snap-back voltage (V\nSB)\nand snap-back current (ISB).  To return to a non-\nconducting state, the current through the device mustfall below the I\nSB (approximately <50mA) and the\nvoltage must fall below the VSB (normally 2.8 volts for a\n3.3V device).  If a 3.3V TVS is connected to 3.3V DCsource, it will never fall below the snap-back voltage of\n2.8V and will therefore stay in a conducting state.Applications Information\n5 \uf8e9 2008 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSSR3.3\nPIN DescriptionsApplications Information (continued)\nBoard Layout Considerations for ESD ProtectionBoard Layout Considerations for ESD ProtectionBoard Layout Considerations for ESD ProtectionBoard Layout Considerations for ESD ProtectionBoard Layout Considerations for ESD Protection\nBoard layout plays an important role in the suppression\nof extremely fast rise-time ESD transients.  Recall thatthe voltage developed across an inductive load isproportional to the time rate of change of currentthrough the load (V = L di/dt).   The total clampingvoltage seen by the protected load will be the sum ofthe  TVS clamping voltage and the voltage due to theparasitic inductance (V\nC(TOT) = VC + L di/dt) .  Parasitic\ninductance in the protection path can result in signifi-\ncant voltage overshoot, reducing the effectiveness of\nthe suppression circuit.    An ESD induced transient for\nexample reaches a peak in approximately 1ns.  For a30A pulse (per IEC 61000-4-2 Level 4), 1nH of seriesinductance will increase the effective clamping voltageby 30V(V = 1x10\n-9 (30/1x10-9)).  For maximum effectiveness,\nthe following board layout guidelines are recom-mended:\nzMinimize the path length between the SR3.3 andthe protected line.\nzPlace the SR3.3 near the RJ45 connector torestrict transient coupling in nearby traces.\nzMinimize the path length (inductance) between theRJ45 connector and the SR3.3.\nMatte Tin Lead Finish\nMatte tin has become the industry standard lead-free\nreplacement for SnPb lead finishes.  A matte tin finishis composed of 100% tin solder with large grains.Since the solder volume on the leads is small com-pared to the solder paste volume that is placed on theland pattern of the PCB, the reflow profile will bedetermined by the requirements of the solder paste.Therefore, these devices are compatible with bothlead-free and SnPb assembly techniques.  In addition,unlike other lead-free compositions, matte tin does nothave any added alloys that can cause degradation ofthe solder joint.\n6 \uf8e9 2008 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSSR3.3\nOutline Drawing - SOT-143\nLand Pattern - SOT-143A\ne\n1243e/2\nE1\ne1 bxN\nbbb CABB\nA2\naaa CABb1\nCONTROLLING DIMENSIONS ARE IN MILLIMETERS (ANGLES IN DEGREES).NOTES:\nOR GATE BURRS.DIMENSIONS "E1" AND "D" DO NOT INCLUDE MOLD FLASH, PROTRUSIONS3.1.\nDATUMS           AND           TO BE DETERMINED AT DATUM PLANE\nREFERENCE JEDEC STD TO-253, VARIATION D.4.-A- -B- 2. -H-SIDE VIEWSEE DETAIL AH\n0.25CSEATING\nPLANEGAUGE \n PLANE0c\nL\nL1\nDETAIL AD\nE\nA1A\nCSEATING PLANEccc C 4X INCHES\n.114\nL1b1\nEDb\nec.011\n.003.082A1DIM\nAMIN\n.000.031\n0.51\n0.202.640.30\n0.082.10\n(.021)--\n.075-\n.093.020\n.008.104\n(0.54)-\n1.92 BSC-\n-\n2.372.90MILLIMETERS\nMAX\n0.151.22MINDIMENSIONS\n0.013MAX NOM\n-\n-.006.048NOM\n0.80\n--\n3.04 2.80 .110 .120\ne1 .008 0.20 BSC\nL .015 .020 0.50 0.40 .024 0.60A2 .029 .035 0.90 0.75 .042 1.07\nE1 .051 1.300.94 0.76 .037 .029\n1.40 1.20\nN4 4\n0-8° 0° 8° 0°-.055 .047\naaa .006 0.15\nbbb .008 0.20\nccc .004 0.10\nC\nYY\nREFERENCE IPC-SM-782A.2.E1\nGZ\nX2E2\nNOTES:\n1.THIS LAND PATTERN IS FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY\nCONSULT YOUR MANUFACTURING GROUP TO ENSURE YOURCOMPANY\'S MANUFACTURING GUIDELINES ARE MET.DIM\nY\nZE2\nG\nX1C\nE1MILLIMETERS INCHES\n(2.20)\n.055\n.141.076\n.039.031.068(.087)\n1.40\n3.601.72\n1.000.801.92DIMENSIONS\nX2 .047 1.20X1 X1\nX1\n7 \uf8e9 2008 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSSR3.3\nContact Information\nSemtech Corporation\nProtection Products Division\n200 Flynn Road, Camarillo, CA 93012\nPhone: (805)498-2111   FAX (805)498-3804traP\nrebmuNhsiniFdaeLrepytQ\nleeReziSleeR\nCT.3.3RSb PnS0 00,3h cnI7\nTCT.3.3RSe erFbP0 00,3h cnI7Marking Codes\nrebmuNtraPgnikraM\nedoC\n3.3RS3 .3R\nOrdering Information\nMouser Electronics\n  \nAuthorized Distributor\n \n  \nClick to View Pricing, Inventory, Delivery & Lifecycle Information:\n \n \n \n Semtech:   \n\xa0 SR3.3.TCT\n'}]
