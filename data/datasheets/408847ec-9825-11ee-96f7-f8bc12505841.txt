The\nwide supply input range of 3.2 V to 65 V allows control\nof many popular DC bus voltages such as 12-V, 24-V\nand 48-V automotive battery systems. The 3.2-V input\nvoltage support is particularly well suited for severe\ncold crank requirements in automotive systems. The\ndevice can withstand and protect the loads from\nnegative supply voltages down to –65 V.\nThe device controls the GATE of the MOSFET to\nregulate the forward voltage drop at 20 mV. The\nregulation scheme enables graceful turn off of the\nMOSFET during a reverse current event and ensures\nzero DC reverse current flow. Fast response (< 0.75\nµs) to Reverse Current Blocking makes the device\nsuitable for systems with output voltage holdup\nrequirements during ISO7637 pulse testing as well as\npower fail and input micro-short conditions.\nThe LM74700-Q1 controller provides a charge pump\ngate drive for an external N-channel MOSFET. The\nhigh voltage rating of LM74700-Q1 helps to simplify\nthe system designs for automotive ISO7637\nprotection. With the enable pin low, the controller is off\nand draws approximately 1 µA of current.\nDevice Information (1)\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nLM74700-Q1 SOT-23 (6) 2.90 mm × 1.60 mm\nLM74700-Q1 SOT-23 (8) 2.90 mm × 1.60 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the data sheet.\nLM74700GATE CATHODE\nENANODE\nVCAP\nGNDVBATT\nTVSVoltage\nRegulatorVOUT\nON OFF\nTypical Application Schematic\nVOUT\nVBATT\nIBATTVGATE\nReverse Current Blocking During Input Shortwww.ti.comLM74700-Q1\nSNOSD17G – OCTOBER 2017 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: LM74700-Q1LM74700-Q1\nSNOSD17G – OCTOBER 2017 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

This easy to use ideal diode controller is paired with an external N-channel MOSFET to replace\nother reverse polarity schemes such as a P-channel MOSFET or a Schottky diode. An internal charge pump is\nused to drive the external N-Channel MOSFET to a maximum gate drive voltage of approximately 15 V. The\nvoltage drop across the MOSFET is continuously monitored between the ANODE and CATHODE pins, and the\nGATE to ANODE voltage is adjusted as needed to regulate the forward voltage drop at 20 mV. This closed loop\nregulation scheme enables graceful turn off of the MOSFET during a reverse current event and ensures zero DC\nreverse current flow. A fast reverse current condition is detected when the voltage across ANODE and\nCATHODE pins reduces below –11 mV , resulting in the GATE pin being internally connected to the ANODE pin\nturning off the external N-channel MOSFET, and using the body diode to block any of the reverse current. An\nenable pin, EN is available to place the LM74700-Q1 in shutdown mode disabling the N-Channel MOSFET and\nminimizing the quiescent current.\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVANODE\nCharge Pump\nEnable LogicVANODE\nVCAPVCAP+\n±QRS Q+\n±\n+±+\n±GM AMP\n+±+±\n20 mV50 mV\n-11 mVVCAP\nCOMPARATORCOMPARATOR\nVCAP_UVVCAP_UV\nENABLE LOGICEN GATEGATE DRIVER\nENABLE \nLOGIC\nREVERSE \nPROTECTION \nLOGICVANODEBias Rails VANODEANODE GATE CATHODE\nVCAP_UVVANODE\nVCAP EN GNDCharge \nPump\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments IncorporatedLM74700-Q1\nSNOSD17G – OCTOBER 2017 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM74700-Q1\n9.3 Feature Description\n9.3.1 Input Voltage\nThe ANODE pin is used to power the LM74700-Q1\'s internal circuitry, typically drawing 80 µA when enabled and\n1 µA when disabled. If the ANODE pin voltage is greater than the POR Rising threshold, then LM74700-Q1\noperates in either shutdown mode or conduction mode in accordance with the EN pin voltage. The voltage from\nANODE to GND is designed to vary from 65 V to –65 V, allowing the LM74700-Q1 to withstand negative voltage\ntransients.\n9.3.2 Charge Pump\nThe charge pump supplies the voltage necessary to drive the external N-channel MOSFET. An external charge\npump capacitor is placed between VCAP and ANODE pins to provide energy to turn on the external MOSFET. In\norder for the charge pump to supply current to the external capacitor the EN pin voltage must be above the\nspecified input high threshold, V (EN_IH) . When enabled the charge pump sources a charging current of 300-µA\ntypical. If EN pins is pulled low, then the charge pump remains disabled. To ensure that the external MOSFET\ncan be driven above its specified threshold voltage, the VCAP to ANODE voltage must be above the\nundervoltage lockout threshold, typically 6.6 V, before the internal gate driver is enabled. Use Equation 1  to\ncalculate the initial gate driver enable delay.\n\x0b \x0c P \x0eP(VCAP _UVLOR)\n(VCAP) DRV _ENV\nT 75 s C x300 A\n(1)\nwhere\n• C (VCAP)  is the charge pump capacitance connected across ANODE and VCAP pins\n• V (VCAP_UVLOR)  = 6.6 V (typical)\n. To remove any chatter on the gate drive approximately 900 mV of hysteresis is added to the VCAP\nundervoltage lockout. The charge pump remains enabled until the VCAP to ANODE voltage reaches 13 V,\ntypically, at which point the charge pump is disabled decreasing the current draw on the ANODE pin. The charge\npump remains disabled until the VCAP to ANODE voltage is below to 12.1 V typically at which point the charge\npump is enabled. The voltage between VCAP and ANODE continue to charge and discharge between 12.1 V\nand 13 V as shown in Figure 9-1 . By enabling and disabling the charge pump, the operating quiescent current of\nthe LM74700-Q1 is reduced. When the charge pump is disabled it sinks 5-µA typical.www.ti.comLM74700-Q1\nSNOSD17G – OCTOBER 2017 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: LM74700-Q1\n0VVIN\nVANODE\nVCAP-VANODEVEN\n6.6 V12.1 V13 V\nGATE DRIVER \nENABLETON TOFF\nV(VCAP UVLOR)TDRV_ENFigure 9-1. Charge Pump Operation\n9.3.3 Gate Driver\nThe gate driver is used to control the external N-Channel MOSFET by setting the GATE to ANODE voltage to\nthe corresponding mode of operation. There are three defined modes of operation that the gate driver operates\nunder forward regulation, full conduction mode and reverse current protection, according to the ANODE to\nCATHODE voltage. Forward regulation mode, full conduction mode and reverse current protection mode are\ndescribed in more detail in the Regulated conduction Mode , Full Conduction Mode  and Reverse Current\nProduction Mode  sections. Figure 9-2  depicts how the modes of operation vary according to the ANODE to\nCATHODE voltage of the LM74700-Q1. The threshold between forward regulation mode and conduction mode is\nwhen the ANODE to CATHODE voltage is 50 mV. The threshold between forward regulation mode and reverse\ncurrent protection mode is when the ANODE to CATHODE voltage is –11 mV.\nVANODE ± VCATHODEGATE connected \nto ANODEGATE to ANODE Voltage Regulated\n0 mV 20 mV 50 mV -11 mVRegulated Conduction ModeReverse Current \nProtection Mode Full Conduction Mode\nGATE connected \nto VCAP\nFigure 9-2. Gate Driver Mode Transitions\nBefore the gate driver is enabled following three conditions must be achieved:\n• The EN pin voltage must be greater than the specified input high voltage.\n• The VCAP to ANODE voltage must be greater than the undervoltage lockout voltage.\n• The ANODE voltage must be greater than VANODE POR Rising threshold.LM74700-Q1\nSNOSD17G – OCTOBER 2017 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM74700-Q1\nIf the above conditions are not achieved, then the GATE pin is internally connected to the ANODE pin, assuring\nthat the external MOSFET is disabled. Once these conditions are achieved the gate driver operates in the\ncorrect mode depending on the ANODE to CATHODE voltage.\n9.3.4 Enable\nThe LM74700-Q1 has an enable pin, EN. The enable pin allows for the gate driver to be either enabled or\ndisabled by an external signal. If the EN pin voltage is greater than the rising threshold, the gate driver and\ncharge pump operates as described in Gate Driver  and Charge Pump  sections. If the enable pin voltage is less\nthan the input low threshold, the charge pump and gate driver are disabled placing the LM74700-Q1 in shutdown\nmode. The EN pin can withstand a voltage as large as 65 V and as low as –65 V. This allows for the EN pin to\nbe connected directly to the ANODE pin if enable functionality is not needed. In conditions where EN is left\nfloating, the internal sink current of 3 uA pulls EN pin low and disables the device.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\n9.4.1 Shutdown Mode\nThe LM74700-Q1 enters shutdown mode when the EN pin voltage is below the specified input low threshold\nV(EN_IL) . Both the gate driver and the charge pump are disabled in shutdown mode. During shutdown mode the\nLM74700-Q1 enters low I Q operation with the ANODE pin only sinking 1 µA. When the LM74700-Q1 is in\nshutdown mode, forward current flow through the external MOSFET is not interrupted but is conducted through\nthe MOSFET\'s body diode.\n9.4.2 Conduction Mode\nConduction mode occurs when the gate driver is enabled. There are three regions of operating during\nconduction mode based on the ANODE to CATHODE voltage of the LM74700-Q1. Each of the three modes is\ndescribed in the Regulated Condution Mode , Full Conduction Mode  and Reverse Current Protection Mode\nsections.\n9.4.2.1 Regulated Conduction Mode\nFor the LM74700-Q1 to operate in regulated conduction mode, the gate driver must be enabled as described in\nthe Gate Driver  section and the current from source to drain of the external MOSFET must be within the range to\nresult in an ANODE to CATHODE voltage drop of –11 mV to 50 mV. During forward regulation mode the ANODE\nto CATHODE voltage is regulated to 20 mV by adjusting the GATE to ANODE voltage. This closed loop\nregulation scheme enables graceful turn off of the MOSFET at very light loads and ensures zero DC reverse\ncurrent flow.\n9.4.2.2 Full Conduction Mode\nFor the LM74700-Q1 to operate in full conduction mode the gate driver must be enabled as described in the\nGate Driver  section and the current from source to drain of the external MOSFET must be large enough to result\nin an ANODE to CATHODE voltage drop of greater than 50-mV typical. If these conditions are achieved the\nGATE pin is internally connected to the VCAP pin resulting in the GATE to ANODE voltage being approximately\nthe same as the VCAP to ANODE voltage. By connecting VCAP to GATE the external MOSFET\'s R DS(ON)  is\nminimized reducing the power loss of the external MOSFET when forward currents are large.\n9.4.2.3 Reverse Current Protection Mode\nFor the LM74700-Q1 to operate in reverse current protection mode, the gate driver must be enabled as\ndescribed in the Gate Driver  section and the current of the external MOSFET must be flowing from the drain to\nthe source. When the ANODE to CATHODE voltage is typically less than –11 mV, reverse current protection\nmode is entered and the GATE pin is internally connected to the ANODE pin. The connection of the GATE to\nANODE pin disables the external MOSFET. The body diode of the MOSFET blocks any reverse current from\nflowing from the drain to source.www.ti.comLM74700-Q1\nSNOSD17G – OCTOBER 2017 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: LM74700-Q1\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI\ndoes not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

The TVS is not required for the LM74700-Q1 to operate,\nbut they are used to clamp the positive and negative voltage surges.

The\nmaximum drain-to-source voltage, V DS(MAX) , must be high enough to withstand the highest differential voltage\nseen in the application. This would include any anticipated fault conditions. It is recommended to use MOSFETs\nwith voltage rating up to 60-V maximum with the LM74700-Q1 because anode-cathode maximum voltage is 65\nV. The maximum V GS LM74700-Q1 can drive is 13 V, so a MOSFET with 15-V minimum V GS should be selected.\nIf a MOSFET with < 15-V V GS rating is selected, a zener diode can be used to clamp V GS to safe level. During\nstartup, inrush current flows through the body diode to charge the bulk hold-up capacitors at the output. The\nmaximum source current through the body diode must be higher than the inrush current that can be seen in the\napplication.\nTo reduce the MOSFET conduction losses, lowest possible R DS(ON)  is preferred, but selecting a MOSFET based\non low R DS(ON)  may not be beneficial always. Higher R DS(ON)  will provide increased voltage information to\nLM74700-Q1\'s reverse comparator at a lower reverse current. Reverse current detection is better with increased\nRDS(ON) . It is recommended to operate the MOSFET in regulated conduction mode during nominal load\nconditions and select R DS(ON)  such that at nominal operating current, forward voltage drop V DS is close to 20-mV\nregulation point and not more than 50 mV.\nAs a guideline, it is suggested to choose (20 mV / I Load(Nominal) ) ≤ R DS(ON)  ≤ ( 50 mV / I Load(Nominal) ).\nMOSFET manufacturers usually specify R DS(ON)  at 4.5-V V GS and 10-V V GS. RDS(ON)  increases drastically below\n4.5-V V GS and R DS(ON)  is highest when V GS is close to MOSFET V th. For stable regulation at light load\nconditions, it is recommended to operate the MOSFET close to 4.5-V V GS, that is, much higher than MOSFET\ngate threshold voltage. It is recommended to choose MOSFET gate threshold voltage V th of 2-V to 2.5-V\nmaximum. Choosing a lower V th MOSFET also reduces the turn ON time.\nBased on the design requirements, preferred MOSFET ratings are:\n• 60-V V DS(MAX)  and ±20-V V GS(MAX)\n• R DS(ON)  at 3-A nominal current: (20 mV / 3A ) ≤ R DS(ON)  ≤ ( 50 mV / 3A ) = 6.67 mΩ ≤ R DS(ON)  ≤ 16.67 mΩ\n• MOSFET gate threshold voltage V th: 2V maximum\nDMT6007LFG MOSFET from Diodes Inc. is selected to meet this 12-V reverse battery protection design\nrequirements and it is rated at:\n• 60-V V DS(MAX)  and ±20-V V GS(MAX)\n• R DS(ON)  6.5-mΩ typical and 8.5-mΩ maximum rated at 4.5-V V GS\n• MOSFET V th: 2-V maximum\nThermal resistance of the MOSFET should be considered against the expected maximum power dissipation in\nthe MOSFET to ensure that the junction temperature (T J) is well controlled.\n10.1.1.2.3 Charge Pump VCAP, input and output capacitance\nMinimum required capacitance for charge pump VCAP and input/output capacitance are:\n• VCAP: Minimum 0.1 µF is required; recommended value of VCAP (µF) ≥ 10 x C ISS(MOSFET) (µF)\n• C IN: minimum 22 nF of input capacitance\n• C OUT: minimum 100 nF of output capacitance\n10.1.1.3 Selection of TVS Diodes for 12-V Battery Protection Applications\nTVS diodes are used in automotive systems for protection against transients. In the 12-V battery protection\napplication circuit shown in Figure 10-2 , a bi-directional TVS diode is used to protect from positive and negative\ntransient voltages that occur during normal operation of the car and these transient voltage levels and pulses are\nspecified in ISO 7637-2 and ISO 16750-2 standards.www.ti.comLM74700-Q1\nSNOSD17G – OCTOBER 2017 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: LM74700-Q1\nThere are two important specifications are breakdown voltage and clamping voltage of the TVS. Breakdown\nvoltage is the voltage at which the TVS diode goes into avalanche similar to a zener diode and is specified at a\nlow current value typical 1 mA and the breakdown voltage should be higher than worst case steady state\nvoltages seen in the system. The breakdown voltage of the TVS+ should be higher than 24-V jump start voltage\nand 35-V suppressed load dump voltage and less than the maximum ratings of LM74700-Q1 (65 V). The\nbreakdown voltage of TVS- should be beyond than maximum reverse battery voltage –16 V, so that the TVS- is\nnot damaged due to long time exposure to reverse connected battery.\nClamping voltage is the voltage the TVS diode clamps in high current pulse situations and this voltage is much\nhigher than the breakdown voltage. TVS diodes are meant to clamp transient pulses and should not interfere\nwith steady state operation. In the case of an ISO 7637-2 pulse 1, the input voltage goes up to –150 V with a\ngenerator impedance of 10 Ω. This translates to 15 A flowing through the TVS - and the voltage across the TVS\nwould be close to its clamping voltage.\nLM74700GATE CATHODEEN\nANODE\nVCAP\nGNDVBAT\nTVS\nSMBJ33CAVoltage\nRegulator\nCIN\n22 nF\nVCAP\n0.1 µFQ1\nCOUT\n47 µF\nFigure 10-2. Typical 12-V Battery Protection with Single Bi-Directional TVS\nThe next criterion is that the absolute maximum rating of Anode to Cathode reverse voltage of the LM74700-Q1\n(–75 V) and the maximum V DS rating MOSFET are not exceeded. In the design example, 60-V rated MOSFET is\nchosen and maximum limit on the cathode to anode voltage is 60 V.\nIn case of ISO 7637-2 pulse 1, the anode of LM74700-Q1 is pulled down by the ISO pulse and clamped by\nTVS-. The MOSFET is turned off quickly to prevent reverse current from discharging the bulk output capacitors.\nWhen the MOSFET turns off, the cathode to anode voltage seen is equal to (TVS Clamping voltage + Output\ncapacitor voltage). If the maximum voltage on output capacitor is 16 V (maximum battery voltage), then the\nclamping voltage of the TVS- should not exceed, (60 V – 16) V = –44 V.\nThe SMBJ33CA TVS diode can be used for 12-V battery protection application. The breakdown voltage of 36.7\nV meets the jump start, load dump requirements on the positive side and 16-V reverse battery connection on the\nnegative side. During ISO 7637-2 pulse 1 test, the SMBJ33CA clamps at –44 V with 15 A of peak surge current\nas shown in Figure 10-5  and it meets the clamping voltage ≤ 44 V.\nSMBJ series of TVS\' are rated up to 600-W peak pulse power levels. This is sufficient for ISO 7637-2 pulses and\nsuppressed load dump (ISO-16750-2 pulse B).\n10.1.1.4 Selection of TVS Diodes and MOSFET for 24-V Battery Protection Applications\nTypical 24-V battery protection application circuit shown in Figure 10-3  uses two uni-directional TVS diodes to\nprotect from positive and negative transient voltages.LM74700-Q1\nSNOSD17G – OCTOBER 2017 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM74700-Q1\nLM74700GATE CATHODEEN\nANODE\nVCAP\nGNDVBATTVS+\nSMBJ58AVoltage\nRegulator\nCIN\n22 nF\nVCAP\n0.1 µFQ1\nCOUT\n47 µF\nTVS-\nSMBJ26AFigure 10-3. Typical 24-V Battery Protection with Two Uni-Directional TVS\nThe breakdown voltage of the TVS+ should be higher than 48-V jump start voltage, less than the absolute\nmaximum ratings of anode and enable pin of LM74700-Q1 (65 V) and should withstand 65-V suppressed load\ndump. The breakdown voltage of TVS- should be lower than maximum reverse battery voltage –32 V, so that the\nTVS- is not damaged due to long time exposure to reverse connected battery.\nDuring ISO 7637-2 pulse 1, the input voltage goes up to –600 V with a generator impedance of 50 Ω. This\ntranslates to 12 A flowing through the TVS-. The clamping voltage of the TVS- cannot be same as that of 12-V\nbattery protection circuit. Because during the ISO 7637-2 pulse, the Anode to Cathode voltage seen is equal to\n(-TVS Clamping voltage + Output capacitor voltage). For a 24-V battery application, the maximum battery\nvoltage is 32 V, then the clamping voltage of the TVS- should not exceed, 75 V – 32 V = 43 V.\nSingle bi-directional TVS cannot be used for 24-V battery protection because breakdown voltage for TVS+ ≥ 65\nV, maximum clamping voltage is ≤ 43 V and the clamping voltage cannot be less than the breakdown voltage.\nTwo un-directional TVS connected back-back needs to be used at the input. For positive side TVS+, SMBJ58A\nwith the breakdown voltage of 64.4 V (minimum), 67.8 (typical) is recommended. For the negative side TVS-,\nSMBJ26A with breakdown voltage close to 32 V (to withstand maximum reverse battery voltage –32 V) and\nmaximum clamping voltage of 42.1 V is recommended.\nFor 24-V battery protection, a 75-V rated MOSFET is recommended to be used along with SMBJ26A and\nSMBJ58A connected back-back at the input.\n10.1.1.5 Application Curves\nFigure 10-4.

In its simplest form, the OR-ing solution for redundant power supplies consists of Schottky OR-ing diodes\nthat protect the system against an input power supply fault condition. A diode OR-ing device provides effective\nand low cost solution with few components. However, the diodes forward voltage drops affects the efficiency of\nthe system permanently, since each diode in an OR-ing application spends most of its time in forward conduction\nmode. These power losses increase the requirements for thermal management and allocated board space.\nThe LM74700-Q1 ICs combined with external N-Channel MOSFETs can be used in OR-ing Solution as shown in\nFigure 10-18 . The forward diode drop is reduced as the external N-Channel MOSFET is turned ON during\nnormal operation. LM74700-Q1 quickly detects the reverse current, pulls down the MOSFET gate fast, leaving\nthe body diode of the MOSFET to block the reverse current flow. An effective OR-ing solution needs to be\nextremely fast to limit the reverse current amount and duration. The LM74700-Q1 devices in OR-ing\nconfiguration constantly sense the voltage difference between Anode and Cathode pins, which are the voltage\nlevels at the power sources (V IN1, VIN2) and the common load point respectively. The source to drain voltage\nVDS for each MOSFET is monitored by the Anode and Cathode pins of the LM74700-Q1. A fast comparator\nshuts down the Gate Drive through a fast Pull-Down within 0.45 μs (typical) as soon as V (IN) – V (OUT) falls below\n–11 mV. It turns on the Gate with 11-mA gate charge current once the differential forward voltage V (IN) – V (OUT)\nexceeds 50 mV.\nVIN1\nLOADVOUT\nCOUTLM74700GATE CATHODEEN\nANODE\nVCAP\nGND\nVIN2\nLM74700GATE CATHODEEN\nANODE\nVCAP\nGND\nFigure 10-18.
