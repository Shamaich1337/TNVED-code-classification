The DDS is a 14-bit output, up to 180 MSPS master clock sine \nwave generator with a 24-bit tuning word, allowing 10.8 Hz/LSB \nfrequency resolution.  \nSRAM data can include directly generated stored waveforms, \namplitude modulation patterns applied to DDS outputs, or DDS \nfrequency tuning words.  \nAn internal pattern control state machine lets the user program \nthe pattern period for the DAC as well the start delay within the \npattern period for the signal output on the DAC .  \nA SPI interface is used to configure the digital waveform \ngenerator and load patterns into the SRAM.  \nA gain adjustment factor and an offset adjustment are applied to \nthe digital signal on their way into the DAC. \nThe AD9102 offers exceptional ac and dc performance and \nsupports DAC sampling rates of up to 180 MSPS. The flexible power supply operating range of 1.8 V to 3.3 V and \nlow power dissipation of the AD9102  make it well suited for \nportable and low power applications.  \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. High Integration. \nOn-chip DDS and 4096 × 14 pattern memory. \n2. Low Power.  \nPower-down mode provides for low power idle periods. \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM \nDAC10kΩ\nIREF\n100µA\n1.8V\nLDOs1V AD9102\nIOUTP\nIOUTNAVDD1AGND\nAVDD2DVDD\nDGNDDLDO1\nSDIO\nSCLK\nRESET\nREFIO\nCAL_SENSE\nFSADJCLKVDD\nCLKGND\nCLKN\nCS\nCLDO\nCLKP1.8V\nLDOSRAMADDRESSGAIN OFFSETDAC\nTIMERS + STATE MACHINESTART ADDR\nSTART DELAYSTOP ADDR DAC CLOCKTRIGGER\nSDO/SDI2/DOUTDLDO2DDSTUNING WORDPHASE\nDAC CLOCKDDSSAWTOOTH\nCONSTANT\nDDSRANDOMSPI\nINTERFACEBAND\nGAPRSET1\n16kΩ\nCLOCK\nDIST\n11220-001 \nFigure 1.  \nAD9102 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

A | Page 16 of 36 TERMINOLOGY \nLinearity Error (Integral Nonlinearity or INL) \nINL is defined as the maximum deviation of the actual analog \noutput from the ideal output, determined by a straight line \ndrawn from zero to full scale. \nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL) \nDNL is the measure of the variation in analog value, normalized \nto full scale, associated with a 1 LSB change in digital input code. \nMonotonicity \nA digital-to-analog converter is monotonic if the output either increases or remains constant as the digital input increases. \nOffset Error \nOffset error is the deviation of the output current from the ideal of \nzero. For IOUTP , 0 mA output is expected when the inputs are all \n0s. For IOUTN, 0 mA output is expected when all inputs are set to 1. \nGain Error \nGain error is the difference between the actual and ideal output span. The actual span is determined by the output when all inputs are set to 1, minus the output when all inputs are set to 0. The \nideal gain is calculated using the measured V\nREF. Therefore, the \ngain error does not include effects of the reference. \nOutput Compliance Voltage  \nOutput compliance voltage is the range of allowable voltage at the output of a current output DAC. Operation beyond the maximum compliance limits can cause either output stage \nsaturation or breakdown, resulting in nonlinear performance. \nTemp er ature Drift \nTemperature drift is specified as the maximum change from the \nambient (25°C) value to the value at either T\nMIN or T MAX. For \noffset and gain drift, the drift is reported in ppm of full-scale \nrange (FSR) per °C. For reference drift, the drift is reported in \nppm per °C. Power Supply Rejection \nPower supply rejection is the maximum change in the full-scale output as the supplies are varied from nominal to minimum \nand maximum specified voltages. \nSettling Time \nSettling time is the time required for the output to reach and \nremain within a specified error band about its final value, \nmeasured from the start of the output transition. \nGlitch Impulse \nAsymmetrical switching times in a DAC give rise to undesired output transients that are quantified by a glitch impulse. It is \nspecified as the net area of the glitch in picovolt-seconds (pV-s). \nSpurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) \nSFDR is the difference, in decibels (dB), between the rms amplitude of the output signal and the peak spurious signal  over the specified bandwidth. \nNoise Spectral Density (NSD) \nNoise spectral density is the average noise power normalized to \na 1 Hz bandwidth, with the DAC converting and producing an \noutput tone. \n \n  \nData Sheet AD9102\n \nRev.

AD9102  Block Diagram \nFigure 29 is a block diagram of the AD9102. The AD9102 has a \nsingle 14-bit current output DAC.  \nAn on-chip band gap reference is included. Optionally, an off-\nchip voltage reference may be used. The full-scale DAC output \ncurrent, also known as gain, is governed by the current, I REF. IREF \nis the current that flows through the I REF resistor. The I REF set \nresistor can be on or off chip at the user’s discretion. When the \non-chip R SET resistor is in use, DAC gain accuracy can be \nimproved by employing the built in automatic gain calibration \ncapability. Automatic calibration can be used with the on-chip \nreference or an external REFIO voltage. A procedure for \nautomatic gain calibration follows.  \nThe power supply rails for the AD9102 are AVDD for analog \ncircuits, CLKVDD/CLKLDO for clock input receivers, and \nDVDD/DLDO1/DLDO2 for digital I/O and for the on-chip digital datapath. AVDD, DVDD, and CLKVDD can range from \n1.8 V to 3.3 V nominal. DLDO1, DLDO2, and CLDO run at \n1.8 V . If DVDD = 1.8 V , connect DLDO1 and DLDO2 to DVDD, with the on-chip LDOs disabled. All three supplies are provided externally in this case. If CLKVDD = 1.8 V , connect \nCLKVDD to CLDO with the on-chip LDOs enabled. Digital signals input to the 14-bit DAC are generated by on-chip \ndigital waveform generation resources. The 14-bit samples are \ninput to the DAC at the CLKP/CLKN sample rate from the \ndigital datapath. The datapath includes gain and offset corrections and a digital waveform source selection multiplexer. Waveform sources are SRAM, direct digital synthesizer (DDS), DDS output amplitude modulated by SRAM data, sawtooth generator, dc constant, and pseudorandom sequence generator. \nThe waveforms output by the source selection multiplexer have \nprogrammable pattern characteristics. The waveforms can be set up to be continuous, continuous pulsed (fixed pattern period and start delay within each pattern period), or finite pulsed (a set number of pattern periods are output, then the pattern stops). \nPulsed waveforms (finite or continuous) have a programmed \npattern period and start delay. The waveform is present in each \npulse period following the programmed pattern period start \nand the start delay.  \nA SPI port enables loading of data into SRAM and \nprogramming of all the control registers inside the device.  \nAD9102 Data Sheet\n \nRev. A | Page 18 of 36 SPI PORT  \nThe AD9102 provides a flexible, synchronous serial communica-\ntions (SPI) port that allows easy interfacing to ASICs, FPGAs, and \nindustry-standard microcontrollers. The interface allows read/write access to all registers that configure the AD9102  and to the on-chip \nSRAM. Its data rate can be up to the SCLK clock speed listed in \nTable 3 and Table 4.  \nThe SPI interface operates as a standard synchronous serial \ncommunication port. CS\n is a low true chip select. When CS \ngoes true, SPI address and data transfer begin. The first bit \ncoming from the SPI master on SDIO is a read write indicator (high for read, low for write). The next 15 bits are the initial register address. The SPI port automatically increments the \nregister address if CS\n stays low beyond the first data-word \nallowing writes to or reads from a set of contiguous addresses.  \nTable 12.

An active \nregister set controls operation of the AD9102 during pattern \ngeneration. A set of shadow registers stores updated register \nvalues. Register updates can be written at any time. When configuration update is complete, the user writes a 1 to the UPDATE bit in the RAMUPDATE register. The UPDATE bit \narms the register set for transfer from shadow registers to active \nregisters. The AD9102 performs this transfer automatically the \nnext time the pattern generator is off. This procedure does not apply to the 4k × 14 SRAM. For the SRAM update procedure, \nsee the SRAM section.  \n \nFigure 33.

A | Page 19 of 36 DAC TRANSFER FUNCTION \nThe AD9102 DAC provides a differential current output, \nIOUTP/IOUTN.  \nThe DAC output current equations are as follows: \nIOUTP  = IOUTFS  × DAC INPUT CODE /214  (1) \nIOUTN  = IOUTFS  × ((214 − 1) − DAC INPUT CODE )/214 (2) \nwhere DAC INPUT CODE  = 0 to 214 − 1. Full-scale current or \nDAC Gain I OUTFS  is 32 times I REF. \nIOUTFS  = 32 × I REF  (3) \nwhere  IREF = VREFIO/RSET. \nIREF is the current that flows through the I REF resistor. The I REF \nresistor may be on or off chip at the users’ discretion. When an \non-chip R SET resistor is in use, DAC gain accuracy can be improved \nby employing the built-in automatic gain calibration capability. \nANALOG CURRENT OUTPUTS \nOptimum linearity and noise performance of DAC outputs can \nbe achieved when they are connected differentially to an amplifier \nor a transformer. In these configurations, common-mode signals  at the DAC outputs are rejected.  \nThe output compliance voltage specifications listed in Table 1 and \nTable 2 must be adhered to for the performance specifications \nin those tables to be met.  \nSETTING I OUTFS , DAC GAIN  \nAs expressed in Equation 3, DAC gain (I OUTFS ) is a function of \nthe reference voltage at the REFIO terminal and R SET.  \nVoltage Reference \nThe AD9102 contains an internal 1.0 V nominal band gap \nreference. The internal reference can be used, or replaced by a \nmore accurate off-chip reference. An external reference can \nprovide tighter reference voltage tolerances and/or lower \ntemperature drift than the on-chip band gap. \nBy default, the on-chip reference is powered up and ready to be \nused. When using the on-chip reference, the REFIO terminal needs to be decoupled to AGND using a 0.1 μF capacitor as \nshown in Figure 34.  \nCURRENT\nSCALING\nx32AD9102\nDAC\nIOUTFS\nRSET0.1µFREFIO\nIREF\nAVSSFSADJVBG\n1.0V\n–+\n11220-034 \nFigure 34.

This \nadds or subtracts up to 20% from the nominal band gap voltage on REFIO. The voltage across the FSADJ resistor tracks this change. As a result, I\nREF varies by the same amount.

Bits[4:0] of the FSADJ register are used to \nprogram values for the on-chip R SET manually.  \nAUTOMATIC I OUTFS  CALIBRATION \nMany applications require tight DAC gain control. The AD9102  \nprovides an automatic I OUTFS calibration procedure used with an \non-chip R SET resistor only. The voltage reference, V REFIO, can be \nthe on-chip reference or an off-chip reference. The automatic \ncalibration procedure does a fine adjustment of the internal R SET \nvalue and the current, I REF.  \nAD9102 Data Sheet\n \nRev. A | Page 20 of 36 When using automatic calibration, the following board level \nconnections are required:  \n1. Connect the FSADJ pin and the CAL_SENSE pin \ntogether. \n2. Install a resistor between the CAL_SENSE pin and \nAGND. To calculate the value of this resistor, use the \nfollowing equation:  \nRCAL_SENSE  = 32 × V REFIO/IOUTFS   \nwhere I OUTFS  is the target full-scale current.  \nAutomatic calibration uses an internal clock. This calibration \nclock is equal to the DAC clock divided by the division factor \nchosen by the CAL_CLK_DIV bits of Register 0x0D. Each \ncalibration cycle is between 4 and 512 DAC clock cycles, depending on the value of CAL_CLK_DIV[2:0]. The frequency \nof the calibration clock should be less than 500 kHz. \nTo perform an automatic calibration, the following steps must \nbe followed: \n1. Set the calibration ranges in Register 0x008[7:0] and \nRegister 0x0D[5:4] to their minimum values to allow best calibration.  \n2. Enable the calibration clock bit, CAL_CLK_EN, in Register 0x0D. \n3. Set the divider ratio for the calibration clock by setting the CAL_CLK_DIV[2:0] bits in Register 0x0D. The default is 512. \n4. Set the CAL_MODE_EN bit in Register 0x0D to Logic 1.  \n5. Set the START_CAL bit in Register 0x0E to Logic 1. This begins the calibration of the comparator, R\nSET, and gain. \n6. The CAL_MODE flag in Register 0x0D goes to Logic 1 while the part is calibrating. The CAL_FIN flag in Register 0x0E goes to Logic 1 when the calibration is complete. \n7. Set the START_CAL bit in Register 0x0E to Logic 0. \n8. After calibration, verify that the overflow and underflow flags in Register 0x0D are not set (Bits[14:8]). If they are set, change the corresponding calibration range to the next larger range and start from Step 5 again.  \n9. If no flag is set, read the DAC_RSET_CAL and \nDAC_GAIN_CAL values in the DACRSET and \nDACAGAIN registers respectively and write them into their corresponding DAC_RSET and DAC_GAIN register fields. \n10. Reset the CAL_MODE_EN bit and the calibration clock \nbit, CAL_CLK_EN, in Register 0x0D to Logic 0 to disable \nthe calibration clock.  \n11. Set the CAL_MODE_EN bit in Register 0x0D to Logic 0. This points the R\nSET and gain control muxes toward the \nregular registers. \n12. Disable the calibration clock bit CAL_CLK_EN in \nRegister 0x0D. \nTo reset the calibration, pulse the CAL_RESET bit in Register 0x0D \nto Logic 1 and Logic 0, pulse the RESET  pin, or pulse the \nRESET bit in the SPICONFIG register. CLOCK INPUT \nFor optimum DAC performance, the AD9102 clock input signal \npair (CLKP/CLKN) should be a very low jitter, fast rise time \ndifferential signal. The clock receiver generates its own common-\nmode voltage, requiring these two inputs to be ac-coupled.  \nFigure 36 shows the recommended interface to a number of \nAnalog Devices LVDS clock drivers that work well with the \nAD9102. A 100 Ω termination resistor and two 0.1 μF coupling \ncapacitors are used. Figure 38 is an interface to an Analog Devices differential PECL driver.

The optional resistor is a series termination. \nAD9510/AD9511/\nAD9512/AD9513/\nAD9514/AD9515/AD9516/AD95180.1µF\nCLKCLK\n0.1µF\n0.1µFCLKNCLKP\nAD9102OPTIONAL\n100Ω\n39kΩCMOS DRIVERCLK+\n50Ω\n11220-037 \nFigure 37.

Transformer Coupled Clock \n \nDAC OUTPUT CLOCK EDGE \nThe DAC can be configured to output samples on the rising or \nfalling edge of the CLKP/CLKN clock input by configuring the DAC_INV_CLK bit in the CLOCKCONFIG register (Register 0x02). \nThis functionality sets the DAC output timing resolution at  \n1/(2 × f\nCLKP/CLKN ). \nGENERATING SIGNAL PATTERNS \nThe AD9102 can generate three types of signal patterns under \ncontrol of its programmable pattern generator.  \n\uf0b7 Continuous waveforms  \n\uf0b7 Periodic pulse train waveforms that repeat indefinitely \n\uf0b7 Periodic pulse train waveforms that repeat a finite number \nof times  \nRUN Bit \nSetting the RUN bit in the PAT_STATUS register (Register 0x1E)  \nto 1 arms the AD9102 for pattern generation. Clearing this bit \nshuts down the pattern generator as shown in Figure 43.  \nTRIGGER  Pin \nA falling edge on the TRIGGER  pin starts the generation of a \npattern. If the RUN bit is set to 1, the falling edge of the TRIGGER  \npin starts the pattern generation. As shown in Figure 41, the pattern \ngenerator state goes to pattern on a number of CLKP/CLKN clock \ncycles following the falling edge of the TRIGGER  pin. This delay \nis programmed in the PATTERN_DELAY bit field. \nThe rising edge on the TRIGGER  pin is a request for termination \nof pattern generation; see Figure 42. \nPATTERN Bit (Read Only) \nWhen the read only PATTERN bit in the PAT_STATUS register \nis set to 1, it indicates that the pattern generator is in the pattern \non state. A 0 indicates that the pattern generator is in the \npattern off state.  \nPattern Types \n\uf0b7 Continuous waveforms are output by the DAC for the \nduration of the pattern on state of the pattern generator. \nContinuous waveforms ignore pattern periods.  \n\uf0b7 Periodic pulse trains that repeat indefinitely are waveforms that are output once during each pattern period. Pattern \nperiods occur one after the other as long as the pattern \ngenerator is in the pattern on state.  \uf0b7 Periodic pulse trains that repeat a finite number of times are the same as those that repeat indefinitely, except that the waveforms are output during a finite number of consecutive pattern periods.  \nPATTERN\nEXECUTEDPATTERN\nEXECUTEDPATTERN\nEXECUTEDTRIGGER\nDACPATTERN_PERIOD\nSTART_DLY\nDATA @\nSTART_ADDRDATA @STOP_ADDR\n11220-040 \nFigure 40. Periodic Pulse Trains Output on All DACs \nPATTERN GENERATOR PROGRAMMING  \nFigure 40 shows periodic pulse train waveforms as seen at the \noutput to each of the DACs. The waveform is generated in each \npattern period. The start delay (START_DLY) is the delay \nbetween the start of each pattern period and the start of the \nwaveform. The DAC waveform is a digital signal stored in SRAM and multiplied by the DAC digital gain factor. The \nSRAM data is read using the DAC address counter.  \nSetting Pattern Period  \nTwo register bit fields are used to set the pattern period. The \nPAT_PERIOD_BASE field in the PAT_TIMEBASE register sets \nthe number of CLKP/CLKN clocks per PATTERN_PERIOD LSB. The PATTERN_PERIOD is programmed in the PAT_PERIOD register. The longest pattern period available is \n65,535 × 16/f\nCLKP/N .  \nSetting Waveform Start Delay Base  \nThe waveform start delay base is programmed in the \nSTART_DELAY_BASE bits of the PAT_TIMEBASE register \n(Register 0x28[3:0]). The START_DELAY register (Register 0x5C) is described in the DAC Input Datapaths section. The start delay base determines how many CLKP/CLKN clock cycles there are per START_DELAY LSB. \ntSUtDLY = PATTERN_DELAY VALUE + 1\nPATTERN\nSTARTSTRIGGER\nCLKP/\nCLKN\nPATTERN\nGENERATOR\nSTATERUN BIT\nPATTERN\nGENERTAOR OFFPATTERN\nGENERTAOR ON\n11220-041 \nFigure 41.

RUN Bit Driven Pattern Stop  \nDAC INPUT DATAPATHS \nTiming in the DAC datapaths is governed by the pattern \ngenerator. The datapath includes a waveform selector, a \nwaveform repeat controller, RAM output and DDS output multiplier (RAM output can amplitude modulate DDS output), DDS cycle counter, DAC digital gain multiplier, and a DAC \ndigital offset summer.  \nDAC Digital Gain Multiplier  \nOn its way into the DAC, the samples are multiplied by a 12-bit \ngain factor that has a range of ±2.0. These gain values are \nprogrammed in the DAC_DGAIN register (Register 0x35). \nDAC Digital Offset Summer \nDAC input samples are summed with a 12-bit dc offset value. \nThe dc offset values are programmed in the DACDOF register \n(Register 0x25).  \nDAC Waveform Selectors \nWaveform selector inputs are: \n\uf0b7 Sawtooth generator output \n\uf0b7 Pseudorandom sequence generator output \n\uf0b7 DC constant generator output \n\uf0b7 Pulsed, phase shifted DDS sine wave output \n\uf0b7 RAM output  \n\uf0b7 Pulsed, phase shifted DDS sine wave output amplitude, \nmodulated by RAM output \nWaveform selection for the DAC is made by programming the \nW AV_CONFIG register (Register 0x27).  Pattern Period Repeat Controller \nThe PATTERN_RPT bit in the PAT_TYPE register (Register 0x1F[0]) controls whether the pattern output auto repeats \n(periodic pulse train repeats indefinitely) or repeats a number \nof consecutive times defined by the DAC_REPEAT_CYCLE bits in Register 0x2B. The latter are periodic pulse trains that repeat \na finite number of times.  \nNumber of DDS Cycles \nThe DAC input datapath establishes the pulse width of the sine \nwave output from the DDS in a number of sine wave cycles. The \ncycle counts are programmed in the DDS_CYC register. \nDDS Phase Shift \nThe DAC input datapath shifts the phase of the output of the \nsingle common DDS. The phase shift is programmed using the \nDDS_PHASE field.  \nDOUT FUNCTION \nIn applications where the AD9102 DAC drives a high voltage \namplifier, such as in ultrasound transducer array element driver \nsignal chains, it can be useful to turn on and off each amplifier at precise times relative to the waveform generated by the AD9102 DAC. The SDO/SDI2/DOUT terminal can be \nconfigured to provide this function.  \nThe SPI interface needs to be configured in 3-wire mode \n(Figure 30 and Figure 31). This is accomplished by setting the \nSPI3WIRE or SPI3WIREM bits in the SPICONFIG register (Register 0x00). When the SPI_DRV or SPI_DRVM bits of the SPICONFIG register are set to Logic 1, the SDO/SDI2/DOUT \nterminal provides the DOUT function.  \nManually Controlled DOUT \nIf the DOUT_MODE bit = 0 in the DOUT_CONFIG register \n(Register 0x2D), DOUT can be turned on or off using the \nDOUT_V AL bit of that same register. \nPattern Generator Controlled DOUT  \nFigure 44 depicts the rising edge of a pattern generator controlled \nDOUT pulse. Figure 45 shows the falling edge. A pattern generator \ncontrolled DOUT is set up by setting the DOUT_MODE bit = 1. Next, the start delay is programmed in the DOUT_START register (Register 0x2C) and the stop delay is programmed into the \nDOUT_STOP bit of the DOUT_CONFIG register. \nDOUT goes high when DOUT_START[15:0] CLKP/CLKN \ncycles after the falling edge of the signal input to the TRIGGER\n \npin. DOUT stays high as long as a pattern is being generated. \nDOUT goes low when DOUT_STOP[3:0] CLKP/CLKN cycles after the clock edge that causes pattern generation to stop.  \nData Sheet AD9102\n \nRev.

DOUT Stop Sequence  \nDIRECT DIGITAL SYNTHESIZER (DDS) \nThe DDS generates sinusoid at a frequency determined by its \ntuning word input. The tuning word is 24 bits wide. The \nresolution of DDS tuning is f CLKP/N /224. The DDS output \nfrequency is DDS_TW × f CLKP/N /224.  \nThe DDS tuning word is programmed using one of two methods. \nFor a fixed frequency, the DDSTW_MSB and DDSTW_LSB bit \nfields are programmed with a constant. When the frequency  of the DDS needs to change within  each pattern period, a sequence \nof values stored in SRAM is combined with a selection of \nDDSTW_MSB bits to form the tuning word.  \nSRAM \nThe AD9102 4k × 14 SRAM can contain signal samples, \namplitude modulation patterns, lists of DDS tuning words, or \nlists of DDS output phase offset words. Any SRAM data address \ncan be written to and read from the SPI port as long as the SRAM is not actively engaged in pattern generation (RUN bit = 0). To write to any SRAM address, set up the PAT_STATUS register \n(Register 0x1E) as follows: \n\uf0b7 BUF_READ = 0 \n\uf0b7 MEM_ACCESS = 1 \n\uf0b7 RUN = 0 \nTo read data from any SRAM address, set up the PAT_STATUS \nas follows: \n\uf0b7 BUF_READ = 1 \n\uf0b7 MEM_ACCESS = 1 \n\uf0b7 RUN = 0 The AD9102 allows SPI read/write access to the SRAM while \nthe SRAM is actively engaged in pattern generation (RUN = 1) \nwith some restrictions.  \nThe SPI port address space for SRAM is Location 0x6000 \nthrough Location 0x6FFF.  \nSRAM can be accessed using any of the SPI operating modes \nshown in Figure 30 through Figure 32. Using the SPI modes of operation shown in Figure 31 and Figure 33, the entire SRAM can be written in (2 + 2 × 4096) ×8/f\nSLCK seconds. \nWhen the PAT_STATUS register RUN bit =1 (pattern generation enabled) data is read using the SRAM address counter. The address counter has a START_ADDR (start address) and STOP_ADDR (stop address). During each pattern period, data is read from SRAM after the START_DELAY period and while \neach address counter is incrementing.  \nWhile the PAT_STATUS register RUN bit = 1 (pattern generation \nenabled), data can be written to or read from SRAM via the SPI \nport outside the address range defined by START_ADDR and \nSTOP_ADDR. \nIncrementing Pattern Generation Mode SRAM Address \nCounters \nThe SRAM address counter can be programmed to be incremented \nby CLKP/CLKN (default) or by the rising edge of the DDS MSB. \nThe DDS_MSB_EN bit in the DDS_CONFIG register makes \nthis selection. For example, DDS MSB can be used to clock the \naddress counter when generating a chirp waveform from the DDS using a list of tuning words in SRAM. Each frequency setting \ndwells for one DDS output sine wave cycle.  \nSAWTOOTH GENERATOR \nWhen sawtooth is selected in the PRESTORE_SEL bits in the \nW AV_CONFIG register, the sawtooth generator is connected to \nthe DAC digital datapath.  \nSawtooth types, shown in Figure 46, are selected using the \nSAW_TYPE bits in the SAW_CONFIG register. The number of \nsamples per sawtooth waveform step is programmed in the \nSAW_STEP bits.  \nPOSITIVE\nSAWTOOTH\nNEGATIVE\nSAWTOOTH\nTRIANGLE\nWAVE\n11220-046 \nFigure 46.

A | Page 24 of 36 PSEUDO RANDOM SIGNAL GENERATOR \nThe pseudorandom noise generator generates a noise signal on \neach DAC output when a pseudorandom sequence is selected in \nthe PRESTORE_SEL fields in the W AV_CONFIG register. Pseudorandom noise signals are generated as continuous waveforms only. \nDC CONSTANT \nA programmable dc current between 0.0 and I OUTFS can be \ngenerated on the DAC when a constant value is selected in the \nPRESTORE_SEL bits of the W AV_CONFIG register. DC \nconstant current is generated as a continuous waveform only.  \nThe dc current level is programmed by writing to the \nDAC_CONST field in the appropriate DAC_CST register. \nPOWER SUPPLY NOTES \nThe AD9102 supply rails are specified in Table 9. The AD9102 \nincludes three on-chip linear regulators. The supply rails driven by \nthese regulators are run at 1.8 V . Some usage rules for these \nregulators include: \n\uf0b7 When CLKVDD is 2.5 V or higher, the 1.8 V on-chip \nCLDO regulator may be used. If CLKVDD = 1.8 V , the \nCLDO regulator must be disabled by setting the \nPDN_LDO_CLK bit in the POWERCONFIG register. CLKVDD and CLDO are connected together. \uf0b7 When DVDD is 2.5 V or higher, the 1.8 V on-chip DLDO1 and DLDO2 regulators may be used. If DVVD is 1.8 V , the DLDO1 and DLDO2 regulators must be disabled by setting the PDN_LDO_DIG1 and PDN_LDO_DIG2 bits in the \nPOWERCONFIG register. DVDD, DLDO1, and DLDO2 \nare connected together.  \nPOWER DOWN CAPABILITIES \nThe POWERCONFIG register lets the user place the AD9102 in a \nreduced power dissipation configuration while the CLKP/CLKN input is running and the power supplies are on. The DAC can be put to sleep by setting the DAC_SLEEP bit in the POWERCONFIG \nregister. Clocking of the waveform generator and the DACs can  \nbe turned on and off by setting the CLK_PDN bit in the CLOCKCONFIG register. Taking these actions places the \nAD9102  in the power down mode, specified in Table 8.  \n \n   \n \n \nData Sheet AD9102\n \nRev.
