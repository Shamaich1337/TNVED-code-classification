At power on, the I/Os are\nconfigured as inputs. The system master can enable\nthe I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the\nI/O configuration bits. The data for each input or\noutput is kept in the corresponding Input or Output\nPort register. The polarity of the Input Port register\ncan be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register. All\nregisters can be read by the system master.\nThe system master can reset the PCA9535 in the\nevent of a timeout or other improper operation by\nutilizing the power-on reset feature, which puts the\nregisters in their default state and initializes the I2C/\nSMBus state machine.\nThe PCA9535 open-drain interrupt ( INT) output is\nactivated when any input state differs from its\ncorresponding Input Port register state and is used to\nindicate to the system master that an input state has\nchanged.\nDevice Information (1)\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nPCA9535SSOP (16) 6.20 mm × 5.30 mm\nVQFN (16) 4.00 mm × 4.00 mm\nQFN (16) 3.00 mm × 3.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the datasheet.\nDB, DBQ, DGV, DW, OR PW PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\nINT\nA1\nA2\nP00\nP01\nP02\nP03\nP04\nP05\nP06\nP07\nGNDVCC\nSDA\nSCL\nA0\nP17\nP16\nP15\nP14\nP13\nP12\nP11\nP1024\n23\n22\n21\n20\n19\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14\n131\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n1224 23 22 21 20\n7 8 9 10 111\n2\n3\n4\n5\n618\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13RGE PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\nA2\nA1\nINT\nP10P11SDA\nP06\nP07GNDVCC\n19SCL\n12\nP12P00\nP01\nP02\nP03\nP04\nP05A0\nP17\nP16\nP15\nP14\nP13A0\nP17\nP16\nP15\nP14\nP1324 22 21 20 19SDA A2\nA1 SCL23\n7 9 10 11 12 8P00\nP01\nP02\nP03\nP04\nP051\n2\n3\n4\n5\n618\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13\nP10P11 P06\nP07 P12GNDRTW PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\nVCCINTwww.ti.comPCA9535\nSCPS129K – AUGUST 2005 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9535PCA9535\nSCPS129K – AUGUST 2005 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the\nremote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data on its ports without having to communicate via\nthe I2C bus. Thus, the PCA9535 can remain a simple slave device.\nThe device outputs (latched) have high-current drive capability for directly driving LEDs. The device has low\ncurrent consumption.\nAlthough pin-to-pin and I2C address compatible with the PCF8575, software changes are required due to the\nenhancements.\nThe PCA9535 is identical to the PCA9555, except for the removal of the internal I/O pullup resistor, which greatly\nreduces power consumption when the I/Os are held low.\nThree hardware pins (A0, A1, and A2) are used to program and vary the fixed I2C address and allow up to\neight devices to share the same I2C bus or SMBus. The fixed I2C address of the PCA9535 is the same as the\nPCA9555, PCF8575, PCF8575C, and PCF8574, allowing up to eight of these devices in any combination to\nshare the same I2C bus or SMBus.www.ti.comPCA9535\nSCPS129K – AUGUST 2005 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9535\n5 Pin Configuration and Functions\nDB, DBQ, DGV, DW, OR PW PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\nINT\nA1\nA2\nP00\nP01\nP02\nP03\nP04\nP05\nP06\nP07\nGNDVCC\nSDA\nSCL\nA0\nP17\nP16\nP15\nP14\nP13\nP12\nP11\nP1024\n23\n22\n21\n20\n19\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14\n131\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n1224 23 22 21 20\n7 8 9 10 111\n2\n3\n4\n5\n618\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13RGE PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\nA2\nA1\nINT\nP10P11SDA\nP06\nP07GNDVCC\n19SCL\n12\nP12P00\nP01\nP02\nP03\nP04\nP05A0\nP17\nP16\nP15\nP14\nP13A0\nP17\nP16\nP15\nP14\nP1324 22 21 20 19SDA A2\nA1 SCL23\n7 9 10 11 12 8P00\nP01\nP02\nP03\nP04\nP051\n2\n3\n4\n5\n618\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13\nP10P11 P06\nP07 P12GNDRTW PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\nVCCINT\nTable 5-1.

Simplified Schematic Of P-Port I/Os\n8.2 Device Functional Modes\n8.2.1 Power-On Reset\nWhen power (from 0 V) is applied to V CC, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9535 in a reset condition until\nVCC has reached V POR. At that point, the reset condition is released and the PCA9535  registers and I2C/SMBus\nstate machine initialize to their default states. After that, V CC must be lowered to below 0.2 V and then back up to\nthe operating voltage for a power-reset cycle.\n8.2.2 I/O Port\nWhen an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 (in Simplified Schematic Of P-Port I/Os  ) are off, which\ncreates a high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above V CC to a maximum of 5.5 V.\nIf the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the Output Port register.\nIn this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and either V CC or GND. The external voltage\napplied to this I/O pin should not exceed the recommended levels for proper operation.www.ti.comPCA9535\nSCPS129K – AUGUST 2005 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9535\n8.2.3 Interrupt ( INT) Output\nAn interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the input mode. After time, t iv,\nthe signal INT is valid. Resetting the interrupt circuit is achieved when data on the port is changed to the\noriginal setting, data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. Resetting occurs in the read mode at the\nacknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal.\nInterrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very short) due to the resetting\nof the interrupt during this pulse. Each change of the I/Os after resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.\nWriting to another device does not affect the interrupt circuit, and a pin configured as an output cannot cause\nan interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the\npin does not match the contents of the Input Port register. Because each 8-pin port is read independently, the\ninterrupt caused by port 0 is not cleared by a read of port 1 or vice versa.\nThe INT output has an open-drain structure and requires pullup resistor to V CC.\n8.2.3.1 Interrupt Errata\nDescription\nThe INT will be improperly de-asserted if the following two conditions occur:\n1. The last I2C command byte (register pointer) written to the device was 00h.\nNote\nThis generally means the last operation with the device was a Read of the input register. However,\nthe command byte may have been written with 00h without ever going on to read the input register.\nAfter reading from the device, if no other command byte written, it will remain 00h.\n2. Any other slave device on the I2C bus acknowledges an address byte with the R/W bit set high\nSystem Impact\nCan cause improper interrupt handling as the Master will see the interrupt as being cleared.\nSystem Workaround\nMinor software change: User must change command byte to something besides 00h after a Read operation to\nthe PCA9535 device or before reading from another slave device.\nNote\nSoftware change will be compatible with other versions (competition and TI redesigns) of this device.\n8.3 Programming\n8.3.1 I2C Interface\nThe bidirectional I2C bus consists of the serial clock (SCL) and serial data (SDA) lines. Both lines must be\nconnected to a positive supply via a pullup resistor when connected to the output stages of a device. Data\ntransfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\nI2C communication with this device is initiated by a master sending a Start condition, a high-to-low transition on\nthe SDA input/output while the SCL input is high (see Figure 8-3 ). After the Start condition, the device address\nbyte is sent, MSB first, including the data direction bit (R/W). This device does not respond to the general call\naddress.\nAfter receiving the valid address byte, this device responds with an ACK, a low on the SDA input/output during\nthe high of the ACK-related clock pulse. The address inputs (A0–A2) of the slave device must not be changed\nbetween the Start and Stop conditions.PCA9535\nSCPS129K – AUGUST 2005 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9535\nOn the I2C bus, only one data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain\nstable during the high pulse of the clock period, as changes in the data line at this time are interpreted as control\ncommands (Start or Stop) (see Figure 8-4 ).\nA Stop condition, a low-to-high transition on the SDA input/output while the SCL input is high, is sent by the\nmaster (see Figure 8-3 ).\nAny number of data bytes can be transferred from the transmitter to the receiver between the Start and the Stop\nconditions. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one ACK bit. The transmitter must release the SDA line before\nthe receiver can send an ACK bit. The device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the ACK\nclock pulse so that the SDA line is stable low during the high pulse of the ACK-related clock period (see Figure\n8-5). When a slave receiver is addressed, it must generate an ACK after each byte is received. Similarly, the\nmaster must generate an ACK after each byte that it receives from the slave transmitter. Setup and hold times\nmust be met to ensure proper operation.\nA master receiver signals an end of data to the slave transmitter by not generating an acknowledge (NACK) after\nthe last byte has been clocked out of the slave. This is done by the master receiver by holding the SDA line high.\nIn this event, the transmitter must release the data line to enable the master to generate a Stop condition.\nSDA\nSCL\nStart ConditionS\nStop ConditionP\nFigure 8-3.

Three bits of this data byte state the operation (read or write) and\nthe internal register (Input, Output, Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that will be affected. This register can be\nwritten or read through the I2C bus.

It only acts on read operation. Writes to\nthese registers have no effect. The default value, X, is determined by the externally applied logic level.\nBefore a read operation, a write transmission is sent with the command byte to let the I2C device know that the\nInput Port registers will be accessed next.\nTable 8-4.

Bit values in this register have no effect on pins defined as inputs. In turn, reads from this\nregister reflect the value that is in the flip-flop controlling the output selection, not the actual pin value.\nTable 8-5.

If a bit in this register is set (written with 1), the corresponding pin\'s polarity is inverted. If a\nbit in this register is cleared (written with a 0), the corresponding pin\'s original polarity is retained.\nTable 8-6.

The command byte is sent after the address and determines which\nregister receives the data that follows the command byte.PCA9535\nSCPS129K – AUGUST 2005 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9535\nThe eight registers within the PCA9535 are configured to operate as four register pairs. The four pairs are Input\nPorts, Output Ports, Polarity Inversions, and Configurations. After sending data to one register, the next data\nbyte is sent to the other register in the pair (see Figure 8-8  and Figure 8-9 ). For example, if the first byte is sent\nto Output Port 1 (register 3), the next byte is stored in Output Port 0 (register 2).\nThere is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this way, each 8-bit register\nmay be updated independently of the other registers.\n1 2 SCL 3 4 5 6 7 8\nSDA A A A Data 09\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0.7 0.0 Data 1 1.7 1.0 A S 0 1 0 0A2 A1 A0 0 PSlave Address Command Byte Data to Port 0 Data to Port 1\nStart ConditionAcknowledge\nFrom Slave\nWrite to Port\nData Out from Port 1Data Out from Port 0\nData V alidAcknowledge\nFrom SlaveAcknowledge\nFrom Slave\ntpv\ntpvR/W\nFigure 8-8.

Write To Configuration Registers\n8.3.2.4.2 Reads\nThe bus master first must send the PCA9535 address with the least-significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure\n8-6 for device address). The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is accessed.\nAfter a restart, the device address is sent again, but this time, the least-significant bit is set to a logic 1. Data\nfrom the register defined by the command byte then is sent by the PCA9535 (see Figure 8-10  through Figure\n8-12).\nAfter a restart, the value of the register defined by the command byte matches the register being accessed when\nthe restart occurred. For example, if the command byte references Input Port 1 before the restart, and the restart\noccurs when Input Port 0 is being read, the stored command byte changes to reference Input Port 0. The original\ncommand byte is forgotten. If a subsequent restart occurs, Input Port 0 is read first. Data is clocked into the\nregister on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse. After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read, but\nthe data now reflect the information in the other register in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 is read, the next\nbyte read is Input Port 0.\nData is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse.

Because the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off, the I/O V IN is about 1.2 V less than V CC. The\nΔICC parameter in Electrical Characteristics shows how I CC increases as V IN becomes lower than V CC. For\nbattery-powered applications, it is essential that the voltage of I/O pins is greater than or equal to V CC, when the\nLED is off, to minimize current consumption.\nFigure 9-2  shows a high-value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 9-3  shows V CC less than the LED supply\nvoltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O V IN at or above V CC and prevent additional\nsupply-current consumption when the LED is off.\nVCCVCC\nLED\nPn100 k/C0087\nFigure 9-2.

Power-on reset requires that the device go through a power cycle to be completely reset. This\nreset also happens when the device is powered on for the first time in an application.\nThe two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 10-1  and Figure 10-2 .\nVCC\nRamp-Up Re-Ramp-Up\nTime to Re-RampTimeRamp-Down\nVCC_RTVCC_RTVCC_FTVCC_TRR_GND\nFigure 10-1.

The glitch width\n(VCC_GW ) and height (V CC_GH ) are dependent on each other. The bypass capacitance, source impedance, and\nthe device impedance are factors that affect power-on reset performance. Figure 10-3  and Table 10-1  provide\nmore information on how to measure these specifications.PCA9535\nSCPS129K – AUGUST 2005 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9535\nVCC\nTimeVCC_GH\nVCC_GWFigure 10-3.
