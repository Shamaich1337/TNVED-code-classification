Each channel has a Gaussian filter \ncharacteristic with a full width half maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of 20nm. The channels are spaced roughly at 50nm \nintervals in the NIR spec trum: R, S, T, U, V, W. The sensor contains \nanalog-to-digital converters (16-bit resolution ADC), which integrate the current from each channel’s photodiode. Upon \ncompletion of the conversion cycle, the integrated result is \ntransferred to the corresponding data registers. The transfers are double-buffered to ensure that the integrity of the data is \nmaintained. \nInterference filters enable high temperature stability and \neliminate lifetime drift. Filter accuracy will be affected by the \nangle of incidence, and require 0°  angle of incidence ±20.0° for \nspecified accuracy. Angles of li ght beyond this will shift the \nspectral response of the filters. The LGA package aperture \nassists in the control of the ligh t input, helping to maintain the \nproper angle of incidence at the sensors.Detailed Description\nRC OscSpectral_I D\nEngineVDD1 VDD2\nGND16MHzMISO\nSCKMOSI\nCSN_SD\nSYNC / RESN°C\nSPI \nMasterTX / SDA_SRX / SCL_S\nUART / I2C LED_DRV\nRSTMulti \nSpectral\nSensor\nULED_IND\nVWI2C_ENBINT\nPage 14 Datasheet, Public \nDocument Feedback  [v4-00] 2022-Nov-30AS7263 − Detailed Description\nData Conversion Description\nAS7263 spectral conversion is implemented via two \nphotodiode banks per device. Bank 1 consists of data from the S, T, U, V photodiodes. Bank 2 cons ists of data from the R, T, U, \nW photodiodes. Spectral conver sion requires the integration \ntime (IT in ms) set to complete. If both photodiode banks are required to complete the conversion, the 2nd bank requires an \nadditional IT ms. Minimum IT for a single bank conversion is 2.8 \nms. If data is required from all 6 photodiodes then the device must perform 2 full conversi ons (2 x Integration Time). \nThe spectral conversion process is controlled with BANK Mode \nsettings as follows:\nBANK Mode 0: Data will be available in registers S, T, U & V (R \nand W registers will be zero).\nBANK Mode 1: Data will be available in registers R, T, U & W (V \nand W registers will be zero).\nBANK Mode 2: Data will be available in registers R, S, T, U, V & W \nWhen the bank setting is Mode 0, Mode 1, or Mode 2, the \nspectral data conversion process operates continuously, with \nnew data available after each IT ms period. In the continuous modes, care should be taken to assure prompt interrupt \nservicing so that integration values from both banks are all \nderived from the same spectral conversion cycle.\nBANK Mode 3: Data will be available in registers R, S, T, U, V & W \nin One-Shot mode.\nWhen the bank setting is Mode 3, the device operates in \nOne-Shot mode. Spectral conversion occurs only when bit 0 of \nthe control register (1SHOT) is set to 1. The 1SHOT bit in the control register is subsequently cleared by hardware at the \nsame time the DATA_RDY bit is set to 1 indicating the availability \nof spectral conversion result  data. The One-Shot mode is \nintended for use when it is critical to ensure that spectral \nconversion results are obtained contemporaneously.\nDatasheet, Public Page 15\n[v4-00] 2022-Nov-30 Document FeedbackAS7263 − Detailed Description\nFigure 15:\nPhoto Diode Array\nFigure 16:\nBank Mode and Data Conversion\nRC Oscillator\nThe timing generation circuit consists of an on-chip 16MHz, \ntemperature compensated oscillator, which provides the master clock for the AS7263.T U S\nR V WPhoto Diode Array\nBANK Mode 0\nOne Conversion S, T, U, V\nIntegration Time\nR, T, U, W One ConversionBANK Mode 1\nIntegration Time\nS, T, U, V 1st ConversionBANK Mode 2\nIntegration Time R, T, U, W 2nd Conversion\nIntegration Time\nPage 16 Datasheet, Public \nDocument Feedback  [v4-00] 2022-Nov-30AS7263 − Detailed Description\nTemperature Sensor\nThe Temperature Sensor is constantly measuring the on-chip \ntemperature and enables temperature compensation \nprocedures.\nReset\nPulling down the RESN pin for longer than 100ms resets the AS7263. \nFigure 17:\nReset Circuit\nIndicator LED\nThe LED, connected to pin LED_IND, can be used to indicate \nprogramming progress of the device. \nWhile programming the AS7263 via the external SD card the \nindicator LED starts flashing (500ms pulses). When \nprogramming is completed the indicator LED is switched off. The LED (LED0) can be turned ON/OFF via AT commands or via \nI²C register control. The LED sink current is programmable from \n1mA, 2mA, 4mA and 8mA.\nElectronic Shutter with LED_DRV Driver Control\nThere are two LED driver outputs that can be used to control up to 2 LEDs. This will allow different wavelength light sources \nto be used in the same system. The LED output sink currents are \nprogrammable and can drive exte rnal LED sources: LED_IND \nfrom 1mA, 2mA, 4mA and 8mA and LED_DRV from 12.5mA, \n25mA, 50mA and 100mA. The sources can be turned off and on \nvia I²C registers control or AT commands and provides the device with an electronic shutter.Reset\nAS7263CLE RESN\nPush > 100ms\nDatasheet, Public Page 17\n[v4-00] 2022-Nov-30 Document FeedbackAS7263 − Detailed Description\nInterrupt Operation\nIf BANK is set to Mode 0 or Mode 1 then the data is ready after \nthe 1st integration time. If BANK is set to Mode 2 or Mode 3 then \nthe data is ready after two integration times. If the interrupt is enabled (INT = 1) then when the data is ready, the INT line is \npulled low and DATA_RDY is set to 1. The INT line is released \n(returns high) when the control register is read. DATA_RDY is cleared to 0 when any of the sensor registers R, S, T, U, V, W are \nread. Since each sensor value is 2 bytes, after the 1\nst byte is read \nthe 2nd byte is shadow-protected in  case an integration cycle \ncompletes just after the 1st byte is read.\nIn continuous spectral conversion mode (BANK setting of Mode \n0, Mode 1, or Mode 2), the sensors continue to gather informa-\ntion at the rate of the integration time, hence if the sensor reg-isters are not read when the interrupt line goes low, it will stay \nlow and the next cycle’s sensor data will be available in the \nregisters at the end of the next integration cycle. When the con-trol register BANK bits are written with a value of Mode 3, \nOne-Shot Spectral Conversion mode is entered. When a single \nset of contemporaneous sensor readings is desired, writing BANK Mode 3 to the control register immediately triggers ex-\nactly two spectral data conversion cycles. At the end of these \ntwo conversion cycles, the DATA_RDY bit is set as for the other BANK modes. To perform a new One-Shot sequence, the control \nregister BANK bits should be written with a value of Mode 3 \nagain. This process may continue until the user writes a different value into the BANK bits.\nI²C Slave Interface\nIf selected by the I2C_ENB pin setting, interface and control can be accomplished through an I²C compatible slave interface to a set of registers that provide access to device control functions \nand output data. These registers on the AS7263 are, in reality, \nimplemented as virtual  registers in software. The actual I²C slave \nhardware registers number only three and are described in the \ntable below. The steps necessary to access the virtual registers \ndefined in the following are explained in pseudocode for exter-nal I²C master writes and reads below.\nI²C Feature List\n•Fast mode (400kHz) and stan dard mode (1 00kHz) support.\n•7+1-bit addressing mode.\n•Write format: Byte.\n•Read format: Byte.\n•SDA input delay and SCL spik e filtering by integrated \nRC-components.\nPage 18 Datasheet, Public \nDocument Feedback  [v4-00] 2022-Nov-30AS7263 − Detailed Description\nFigure 18:\nI²C Slave Device Address and Physical Registers\nI²C Virtual Register Write Access\nFigure 19  shows the pseudocode ne cessary to write virtual \nregisters on the AS7263. Note th at, because the actual registers \nof interest are realized as virtual registers, a means of indicating whether there is a pending read or write operation of a given \nvirtual register is needed. To convey this information, the most \nsignificant bit of the virtual regist er address is used as a marker. \nIf it is 1, then a write is pending, otherwise the slave is expecting \na virtual read operation. The pseudocode illustrates the proper \ntechnique for polling of the I²C slave status register to ensure the slave is ready for each transaction.Entity Description Note\nDevice Slave \nAddress8-bit Slave AddressByte = 1001 001 x\n      x= 1 for Master Read (byte = 93 hex)      x= 0 for Master Write (byte = 92 hex)\nSTATUS \nRegisterI²C slave interface STATUS \nregister.
