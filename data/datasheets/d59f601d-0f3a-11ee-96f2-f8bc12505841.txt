Antenna Description    \n2J6050BGF   “The Falcon Series”\nA Remarkable All-Inclusive Antenna Solution\nWhen it comes to choosing the most competitive and versatile antenna solution, the Falcon Series is at the top of its class. This uniquely designed \n2J6050 BGF Falcon Antenna is built to enable compatibility with different communication standards and a variety of technologies offering the \narchitecture of a 3-in-1, 2-in-1 and also 1-in-1 configurations. \nThe outstanding feature of this multi-versatile antenna is that it has a unique, sleek and compact design with a maximum height of 15 mm. This allows \nfor a turnkey implementation of NB-IoT , CAT-M devices to be used in applications such as environmental monitoring, waste management, fleet \ntracking and other multitudes of systems. This solution combines the advantages of low profile, low cost and massive deployment operations. \nSeveral mounting options such as adhesive, magnetic, screw and magnetic/adhesive make the installation of this antenna extremely convenient.\nHigh Rejection GNSS Filter T echnology\nThe Global Navigation Satellite System is a modernized technology denoting satellite navigation systems that provide autonomous geo-spatial \npositioning with global coverage. To keep up with its latest technological refinement, the 2JP6050 BGF Falcon Antenna offers a high rejection GNSS \nfilter technology in a compact design, enabling it to handle reception when collocated along other antennas in the same enclosure such as LTE or \nWiFi standards, allowing the absorption and protection undesired against out-of-band signals. The low noise figure helps to maintain excellent signal \nquality providing signal attenuation without impacting in-band signal quality .\nInstallation and Safety Profile\nThis antenna  is fully customizable with variable cable lengths and connector types.  It also includes a standard RF cable or low loss cable for better \nreception and range. Where projects require a highly durable antenna for extensive outdoor use, this series features a high-grade UV stable plastic \nthat protects it from ultraviolet rays deterioration.Typical applications\n- Infotainment systems\n- WiFi hotspot\n- HD video transmission\n- Dash cameras\n- Connected cars\n- Self-driving cars\n- Fleet management\n- Gateways\n- Routers\n- Public transportation\n- Logistics\n- And othersCompatibility Standards\nLTE Cables \n- CAT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 1 12 \n- NB-IoT , LTE-NB1, CA T-M1, CA T-M2\n- WCDMA, UMTS, HSP A, EDGE GRPS, GSM, CDMA\n2.4/5.0 Cables  \n- WiFi, Bluetooth, BLE, ISM\n- DSRC, V2V , V2X  \n- Sigfox, LoRa, ZigBee, RPMA, LPW AN\nGPS/GLO Cable  \n- GPS, GLONASS\n- Galileo, QZSS, L1, E1\nwww .2j-antennae.com www .2j-antennasusa.com Page: 2/1 3Standout Features\n- Antenna 3-in-1 compatible with LTE, Wifi and GNSS devices\n- Worldwide Utility LTE/4G/3G/2G\n- 15 mm max height profile\n- Different mounting options available- High rejection GNSS filter technology in compact collocated design\n- GNSS capability for GPS, Glonass, Galileo, and QZSS\n- Patented GNSS low power consumption and low noise figure\n- Enhanced geolocation and precise tracking\n \nwww .2j-antennae.com www .2j-antennasusa.com Page: 3/1 32.
