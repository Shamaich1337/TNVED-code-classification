All three devices\nhave an active-low reset output, which is guaranteed tobe in the correct state for V\nCCdown to 1V. The MAX823\nalso offers a watchdog input and manual reset input.The MAX824 offers a watchdog input and a comple-mentary active-high reset.

The MAX823/MAX824/MAX825 µP super-visory circuits assert a reset to prevent code-executionerrors during power-up, power-down, and brownoutconditions. RESET is guaranteed to be a logic low for\nV\nCCdown to 1V. Once V CCexceeds the reset thresh-\nold, an internal timer keeps RESET low for the specified\nreset timeout period (t RP); after this interval, RESET\nreturns high (Figure 2).\nIf a brownout condition occurs (V CCdips below the\nreset threshold), RESET goes low. Each time RESET is\nasserted it stays low for the reset timeout period. Any\ntime V CCgoes below the reset threshold the internal\ntimer restarts. RESET both sources and sinks current.\nRESET on the MAX824/MAX825 is the inverse ofRESET.\nManual Reset Input (MAX823/MAX825)\nMany µP-based products require manual reset capabili-ty, allowing the operator, a test technician, or externallogic circuitry to initiate a reset. On the MAX823/MAX825, a logic low on MRasserts reset. Reset remains\nasserted while MRis low, and for t\nRP(200ms nominal)\nafter it returns high. MRhas an internal 52k Ωpullup\nresistor, so it can be left open if not used. This input canbe driven with CMOS logic levels or with open-drain/collector outputs. Connect a normally open momentaryswitch from MRto GND to create a manual-reset func-\ntion; external debounce circuitry is not required. If MRis\ndriven from long cables or the device is used in a noisyenvironment, connect a 0.1µF capacitor from MRto\nGND to provide additional noise immunity.Watchdog Input (MAX823/MAX824)\nIn the MAX823/MAX824, the watchdog circuit monitorsthe µP’s activity. If the µP does not toggle the watchdoginput (WDI) within t\nWD(1.6s), reset asserts. The internal\n1.6s timer is cleared by either a reset pulse or by tog-gling WDI, which detects pulses as short as 50ns.While reset is asserted, the timer remains cleared anddoes not count. As soon as reset is released, the timerstarts counting (Figure 3).\nDisable the watchdog function by leaving WDI uncon-\nnected or by three-stating the driver connected to WDI.The watchdog input is internally driven low during thefirst 7/8 of the watchdog timeout period and high for thelast 1/8 of the watchdog timeout period. When WDI isleft unconnected, this internal driver clears the 1.6stimer every 1.4s. When WDI is three-stated or uncon-nected, the maximum allowable leakage current is10µA and the maximum allowable load capacitance is200pF.\nApplications Information\nWatchdog Input Current\nThe MAX823/MAX824 WDI inputs are internally driventhrough a buffer and series resistor from the watchdogcounter (Figure 1). When WDI is left unconnected, thewatchdog timer is serviced within the watchdog timeoutperiod by a low-high-low pulse from the counter chain.For minimum watchdog input current (minimum overallpower consumption), leave WDI low for the majority ofthe watchdog timeout period, pulsing it low-high-lowonce within the first 7/8 of the watchdog timeout periodto reset the watchdog timer. If WDI is externally drivenhigh for the majority of the timeout period, up to 160µAcan flow into WDI.\nVCC\n1V 1V\ntRDVRST VRST\ntRD RESET\nGNDRESET\ntRPtRP\nFigure 2.

This allows\nµPs with bidirectional resets, such as the 68HC11, toforce RESET low when the MAX823/MAX824/MAX825\nare pulling RESET high (Figure 4).\nNegative-Going V CCTransients\nThese supervisors are relatively immune to short-duration, negative-going V\nCCtransients (glitches), which\nusually do not require the entire system to shut down.Resets are issued to the µP during power-up, power-down, and brownout conditions.\nThe Typical Operating Characteristics show a graph of\nthe MAX823_’s Maximum V\nCCTransient Duration vs.\nReset Threshold Overdrive, for which reset pulses are\nnotgenerated. The graph was produced using nega-\ntive-going V CCpulses, starting at 5V and ending below\nthe reset threshold by the magnitude indicated (resetthreshold overdrive). The graph shows the maximumpulse width that a negative-going V\nCCtransient can\ntypically have without triggering a reset pulse. As theamplitude of the transient increases (i.e., goes fartherbelow the reset threshold), the maximum allowablepulse width decreases.An optional 0.1µF bypass capacitor mounted close toV\nCCprovides additional transient immunity.\nWatchdog Software Considerations\n(MAX823/MAX824)\nOne way to help the watchdog timer monitor softwareexecution more closely is to set and reset the watchdoginput at different points in the program, rather thanpulsing the watchdog input high-low-high or low-high-low. This technique avoids a stuck loop, in which thewatchdog timer would continue to be reset inside theloop, keeping the watchdog from timing out.\nFigure 5 shows an example of a flow diagram where the\nI/O driving the watchdog input is set high at the begin-ning of the program, set low at the beginning of everysubroutine or loop, then set high again when the pro-gram returns to the beginning. If the program shouldhang in any subroutine, the problem would quickly becorrected, since the I/O is continually set low and thewatchdog timer is allowed to time out, causing a resetor interrupt to be issued. As described in the Watchdog\nInput Current section, this scheme results in higher time\naverage WDI input current than does leaving WDI lowfor the majority of the timeout period and periodicallypulsing it low-high-low.\nMAX823\nMAX824MAX825\nµPVCCVCC\nVCC\nVCC\nGND\nGNDRESETISOURCE  MAX = 800 µA L, M\n                          400 µA T, S, R, Z, Y\nRESET\nGENERATOR\nFigure 4.

#### Description:
The MAX825SEUK+T is a microprocessor supervisory circuit designed to enhance system reliability and accuracy by providing reset output, watchdog timer, and manual reset input functions. It is part of the MAX825 series, which is specifically engineered to ignore fast transients on the supply voltage (V_CC). The device ensures that the microprocessor starts in a known state during power-up, power-down, and brownout conditions.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Computers and Controllers**: Ensures reliable operation during power fluctuations.
- **Embedded Controllers**: Provides reset functionality for embedded systems.
- **Intelligent Instruments**: Monitors power supply levels to prevent erroneous operation.
- **Automotive Systems**: Used in automotive electronics for critical monitoring.
- **Critical Microprocessor Monitoring**: Protects against unexpected resets and system failures.
- **Portable/Battery-Powered Equipment**: Low power consumption makes it suitable for battery-operated devices.

This component is ideal for applications where reliable reset functionality is critical, particularly in environments subject to voltage fluctuations or transients.
