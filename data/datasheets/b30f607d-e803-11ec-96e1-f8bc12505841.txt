A \nbuilt-in 32,768 Hz oscillator (external crystal controlled) and 8 bytes of the SRAM (see Table 4 on page 18 ) are used for the clock/calendar function and are configured in binary \ncoded decimal (BCD) format.\nAn additional 12 bytes of RAM provide status/control of alarm, watchdog and square wave \nfunctions. Addresses and data are transferred serially via a serial SPI interface. The built-in address register is incremented automatically after each WRITE or READ data byte. The M41T94 has a built-in power sense circuit which detects power failures and automatically switches to the battery supply when a power failure occurs. The energy needed to sustain the SRAM and clock operations can be supplied by a small lithium button-cell supply when a power failure occurs. Functions available to the user include a non-volatile, time-of-day clock/calendar, alarm interrupts, watchdog timer and programmable square wave output. Other features include a power-on reset as well as two additional debounced inputs (\nRSTIN1 and RSTIN2) which can also generate an output reset ( RST). The eight clock \naddress locations contain the century, year, month, date, day, hour, minute, second and tenths/hundredths of a second in 24-hour BCD format. Corrections for 28, 29 (leap year - valid until year 2100), 30 and 31 day months are made automatically. The ninth clock address location controls user access to the clock information and also stores the clock software calibration setting.\nThe M41T94 is supplied in either a 16-lead plastic SOIC (requiring user supplied crystal and \nbattery) or a 28-lead SOIC SNAPHAT\n® package (which integrates both crystal and battery \nin a single SNAPHAT top). The 28-pin, 330 mil SOIC provides sockets with gold plated contacts at both ends for direct connection to a separate SNAPHAT housing containing the battery and crystal. The unique design allows the SNAPHAT battery/crystal package to be mounted on top of the SOIC package after the completion of the surface mount process. \nInsertion of the SNAPHAT housing after reflow prevents potential battery and crystal \ndamage due to the high temperatures required for device surface-mounting. The SNAPHAT housing is also keyed to prevent reverse insertion.\nThe SOIC and battery/crystal packages are shipped separately in plastic anti-static tubes or \nin tape & reel form. For the 28-lead SOIC, the battery/crystal package (e.g., SNAPHAT) part number is “M4TXX-BR12SH” (see Table 21 on page 36 ).\nCaution: Do not place the SNAPHAT battery/crystal top in conductive foam, as this will drain the \nlithium button-cell battery.\nDocID007564 Rev 7 7/39M41T94 Description\n39Figure 1.

Data is shifted out on the \nfalling edge of the serial clock.\n2.2 Serial data input (SDI)\nThe input pin is used to transfer data serially into the device. Instructions, addresses, and \nthe data to be written, are each received this way. Input is latched on the rising edge of the serial clock.\n2.3 Serial clock (SCL)\nThe serial clock provides the timing for the serial interface (as shown in Figure 7 on page 13  \nand Figure 8 on page 14 ). The W/R bit, addresses, or data are latched, from the input pin, \non the rising edge of the clock input. The output data on the SDO pin changes state after the falling edge of the clock input.\nThe M41T94 can be driven by a microcontroller with its SPI peripheral running in either of \nthe two following modes:\n\uf0b7 (CPOL, CPHA) = ('0', '0') or\n\uf0b7 (CPOL, CPHA) = ('1', '1').\nFor these two modes, input data (SDI) is latched in by the low-to-high transition of clock \nSCL, and output data (SDO) is shifted out on the high-to-low transition of SCL (see Table 2 \non page 10  and Figure 6 on page 10 ).\n2.4 Chip enable ( E)\nWhen E is high, the memory device is deselected, and the SDO output pin is held in its high \nimpedance state. After power-on, a high-to-low transition on E is required prior to the start of \nany operation.\nOperation M41T94\n12/39 DocID007564 Rev 73 Operation\nThe M41T94 clock operates as a slave device on the SPI serial bus. Each memory device is \naccessed by a simple serial interface that is SPI bus compatible. The bus signals are SCL, SDI and SDO (see Table 1 on page 8  and Figure 5 on page 9 ). The device is selected when \nthe chip enable input (\nE) is held low. All instructions, addresses and data are shifted serially \nin and out of the chip. The most significant bit is presented first, with the data input (SDI) sampled on the first rising edge of the clock (SCL) after the chip enable (\nE) goes low. The 64 \nbytes contained in the device can then be accessed sequentially in the following order:\n\uf0b7 1st byte: tenths/hundredths of a second register\n\uf0b7 2nd byte: seconds register\n\uf0b7 3rd byte: minutes register\n\uf0b7 4th byte: century/hours register\n\uf0b7 5th byte: day register\n\uf0b7 6th byte: date register\n\uf0b7 7th byte: month register\n\uf0b7 8th byte: year register \n\uf0b7 9th byte: control register\n\uf0b7 10th byte: watchdog register\n\uf0b7 11th - 16th bytes: Alarm registers\n\uf0b7 17th - 19th bytes: reserved\n\uf0b7 20th byte: square wave register\n\uf0b7 21st - 64th bytes: user RAM\nThe M41T94 clock continually monitors VCC for an out-of tolerance condition. Should VCC \nfall below VPFD, the device terminates an access in progress and resets the device address \ncounter. Inputs to the device will not be recognized at this time to prevent erroneous data from being written to the device from a an out-of-tolerance system. When V\nCC falls below \nVSO, the device automatically switches over to the battery and powers down into an ultra \nlow current mode of operation to conserve battery life. As system power returns and VCC \nrises above VSO, the battery is disconnected, and the power supply is switched to external \nVCC.\nWrite protection continues until VCC reaches VPFD (min) plus tREC (min). For more \ninformation on battery storage life refer to application note AN1012.\nDocID007564 Rev 7 13/39M41T94 Operation\n393.1 SPI bus characteristics\nThe serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus is intended for synchronous communication \nbetween different ICs. It consists of four signal lines: serial data input (SDI), serial data output (SDO), serial clock (SCL) and a chip enable (\nE). \nBy definition a device that gives out a message is called “transmitter,” the receiving device \nthat gets the message is called “receiver.” The device that controls the message is called “master.” The devices that are controlled by the master are called “slaves.”\nThe \nE input is used to initiate and terminate a data transfer. The SCL input is used to \nsynchronize data transfer between the master (micro) and the slave (M41T94) devices.\nThe SCL input, which is generated by the microcontroller, is active only during address and \ndata transfer to any device on the SPI bus (see Figure 5 on page 9 ).\nThe M41T94 can be driven by a microcontroller with its SPI peripheral running in either of \nthe two following modes:\n\uf0b7 (CPOL, CPHA) = ('0', '0') or\n\uf0b7 (CPOL, CPHA) = ('1', '1').\nFor these two modes, input data (SDI) is latched in by the low-to-high transition of clock \nSCL, and output data (SDO) is shifted out on the high-to-low transition of SCL (see Table 2 \non page 10  and Figure 6 on page 10 ).\nThere is one clock for each bit transferred. Address and data bits are transferred in groups \nof eight bits. Due to memory size the second most significant address bit is a Don’t Care (address bit 6).\nFigure 7.

Any data transfer considers the first bit to define whether a READ or WRITE will occur. This is followed by seven bits defining the address to be read or written. Data is transferred out of the SDO for a READ operation and into the SDI for a WRITE operation. The address is always the second through the eighth bit written after the Enable (\nE) pin goes low. If the first bit is a '1,' one or more WRITE cycles will occur. If the first bit is \na '0,' one or more READ cycles will occur (see Figure Figure 9 on page 16  and Figure 10 on \npage 16 ).\nData transfers can occur one byte at a time or in multiple byte burst mode, during which the \naddress pointer will be automatically incremented. For a single byte transfer, one byte is read or written and then \nE is driven high. For a multiple byte transfer all that is required is \nthat E continue to remain low. Under this condition, the address pointer will continue to \nincrement as stated previously. Incrementing will continue until the device is deselected by taking \nE high. The address will wrap to 00h after incrementing to 3Fh.\nThe system-to-user transfer of clock data will be halted whenever the address being read is \na clock address (00h to 07h). Although the clock continues to maintain the correct time, this will prevent updates of time and date during either a READ or WRITE of these address locations by the user. The update will resume either due to a deselect condition or when the pointer increments to an non-clock or RAM address (08h to 3Fh).\nNote: This is true both in READ and WRITE mode.\n3.3 Data retention mode\nWith valid VCC applied, the M41T94 can be accessed as described above with READ or \nWRITE cycles. Should the supply voltage decay, the M41T94 will automatically deselect, write protecting itself when V\nCC falls between VPFD (max) and VPFD (min) (see Figure 17 on \npage 30 ). At this time, the reset pin ( RST) is driven active and will remain active until VCC \nreturns to nominal levels. When VCC falls below the switchover voltage (VSO), power input is \nswitched from the VCC pin to the SNAPHAT battery (or external battery for SO16) at this \ntime, and the clock registers are maintained from the attached battery supply. All outputs become high impedance. On power-up, when V\nCC returns to a nominal value, write \nprotection continues for tREC by internally inhibiting E. The RST signal also remains active \nduring this time (see Figure 17 on page 30 ). Before the next active cycle, chip enable should \nbe taken high for at least tEHEL , then low.\nFor a further more detailed review of battery lifetime calculations, please see application \nnote AN1012.\nOperation M41T94\n16/39 DocID007564 Rev 7Figure 9.

Tenths/hundredths of seconds, seconds, minutes, and hours are contained within the first four registers. Bits D6 and D7 of clock register 03h (century/hours register) contain the CENTURY ENABLE bit (CEB) and the CENTURY bit (CB). Setting CEB to a '1' will cause CB to toggle, either from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0' at the turn of the century (depending upon its initial state). If CEB is set to a '0,' CB will not toggle. Bits D0 through D2 of register 04h contain the day (day of week). Registers 05h, 06h, and 07h contain the date (day of month), month and years. The ninth clock register is the control register (this is described in the clock calibration section). Bit D7 of register 01h contains the STOP bit (ST). Setting this bit to a '1' will cause the oscillator to stop. If the device is expected to spend a significant amount of time on the shelf, the oscillator may be stopped to reduce current drain. When reset to a '0' the oscillator restarts within one second.\nThe eight clock registers may be read one byte at a time, or in a sequential block. The \ncontrol register (address location 08h) may be accessed independently. Provision has been made to assure that a clock update does not occur while any of the eight clock addresses are being read. If a clock address is being read, an update of the clock registers will be halted. This will prevent a transition of data during the READ.\n4.1 Power-down time-stamp\nWhen a power failure occurs, the halt update bit (HT) will automatically be set to a '1.' This will prevent the clock from updating the clock registers, and will allow the user to read the exact time of the power-down event. Resetting the HT bit to a '0' will allow the clock to update the clock registers with the current time. For more information, see application note \nAN1572.\n4.2 Clock registers\nThe M41T94 offers 20 internal registers which contain clock, alarm, watchdog, flag, square \nwave and control data (see Table 4 on page 18 ). These registers are memory locations \nwhich contain external (user accessible) and internal copies of the data (usually referred to as BiPORT\n™ cells). The external copies are independent of internal functions except that \nthey are updated periodically by the simultaneous transfer of the incremented internal copy. \nThe internal divider (or clock) chain will be reset upon the completion of a WRITE to any \nclock address.\nThe system-to-user transfer of clock data will be halted whenever the clock addresses (00h \nto 07h) are being written. The update will resume either due to a deselect condition or when the pointer increments to a non-clock or RAM address.\nClock and alarm registers store data in BCD. Control, watchdog and square wave registers \nstore data in binary format.\nClock operations M41T94\n18/39 DocID007564 Rev 7          Table 4. Clock register map(1)\n1.

The alarm can be configured to go \noff at a prescribed time on a specific month, date, hour, minute, or second, or repeat every year, month, day, hour, minute, or second. It can also be programmed to go off while the M41T94 is in the battery backup to serve as a system wake-up call.\nBits RPT5-RPT1 put the alarm in the repeat mode of operation. Table 5 on page 19  shows \nthe possible configurations. Codes not listed in the table default to the once per second mode to quickly alert the user of an incorrect alarm setting.\nWhen the clock information matches the alarm clock settings based on the match criteria \ndefined by RPT5-RPT1, the AF (alarm flag) is set. If AFE (alarm flag enable) is also set, the alarm condition activates the \nIRQ/FT/OUT pin.\nNote: If the address pointer is allowed to increment to the flag register address, an alarm condition \nwill not cause the interrupt/flag to occur until the address pointer is moved to a different address. It should also be noted that if the last address written is the “Alarm Seconds,” the address pointer will increment to the flag address, causing this situation to occur.\nTo disable the alarm, write '0' to the alarm date register and to RPT1–5. The \nIRQ/FT/OUT \noutput is cleared by a READ to the flags register. This READ of the flags register will also reset the alarm flag (D6; register 0Fh). See Figure 11 on page 19 .\nThe \nIRQ/FT/OUT pin can also be activated in the battery backup mode. The IRQ/FT/OUT \nwill go low if an alarm occurs and both ABE (alarm in battery backup mode enable) and AFE are set. The ABE and AFE bits are reset during power-up, therefore an alarm generated during power-up will only set AF. The user can read the flag register at system boot-up to determine if an alarm was generated while the M41T94 was in the deselect mode during power-up. Figure 12 on page 20  illustrates the backup mode alarm timing.\n          \nFigure 11. Alarm interrupt reset waveformsTable 5.

The user \nprograms the watchdog timer by setting the desired amount of time-out into the Watchdog register, address 09h. bits BMB4-BMB0 store a binary multiplier and the two lower order bits RB1-RB0 select the resolution, where 00 = \n1/16 second, 01 = 1/4 second, 10 = 1 second, \nand 11 = 4 seconds. The amount of time-out is then determined to be the multiplication of the five-bit multiplier value with the resolution. (For example: writing 00001110 in the Watchdog register = 3*1 or 3 seconds). \nNote: Accuracy of timer is within ± the selected resolution.\nIf the processor does not reset the timer within the specified period, the M41T94 sets the \nWDF (watchdog flag) and generates a watchdog interrupt or a microprocessor reset. WDF is reset by reading the flags register (0Fh).\nThe most significant bit of the watchdog register is the watchdog steering bit (WDS). When \nset to a '0,' the watchdog will activate the \nIRQ/FT/OUT pin when timed-out. When WDS is \nset to a '1,' the watchdog will output a negative pulse on the RST pin for tREC. The watchdog \nregister and the AFE, ABE, SQWE, and FT bits will reset to a '0' at the end of a watchdog time-out when the WDS bit is set to a '1.'\nThe watchdog timer can be reset by two methods: \n1. a transition (high-to-low or low-to-high) can be applied to the watchdog input pin (WDI), \nor \n2. the microprocessor can perform a WRITE of the watchdog register. \nThe time-out period then starts over. The WDI pin should be tied to V\nSS if not used. In order \nto perform a software reset of the watchdog timer, the original time-out period can be written into the watchdog register, effectively restarting the count-down cycle.\nShould the watchdog timer time-out, and the WDS bit is programmed to output an interrupt, \na value of 00h needs to be written to the watchdog register in order to clear the \nIRQ/FT/OUT \npin. This will also disable the watchdog function until it is again programmed correctly. A READ of the flags register will reset the watchdog flag (bit D7; register 0Fh).\nThe watchdog function is automatically disabled upon power-up and the watchdog register \nis cleared. If the watchdog function is set to output to the \nIRQ/FT/OUT pin and the frequency \ntest (FT) function is activated, the watchdog function prevails and the frequency test function is denied.\n4.5 Square wave output\nThe M41T94 offers the user a programmable square wave function which is output on the \nSQW pin. RS3-RS0 bits located in 13h establish the square wave output frequency. These frequencies are listed in Table Table 6 on page 22 . Once the selection of the SQW \nfrequency has been completed, the SQW pin can be turned on and off under software \ncontrol with the square wave enable bit (SQWE) located in register 0Ah.\nClock operations M41T94\n22/39 DocID007564 Rev 7          \n4.6 Power-on reset\nThe M41T94 continuously monitors VCC. When VCC falls to the power fail detect trip point, \nthe RST pulls low (open drain) and remains low on power-up for tREC after VCC passes \nVPFD (max). The RST pin is an open drain output and an appropriate pull-up resistor should \nbe chosen to control rise time.\n4.7 Reset inputs ( RSTIN1 & RSTIN2)\nThe M41T94 provides two independent inputs which can generate an output reset. The \nduration and function of these resets is identical to a reset generated by a power cycle. Table 7 on page 23  and Figure 13 on page 23  illustrate the AC reset characteristics of this \nfunction. Pulses shorter than t\nRLRH1  and tRLRH2  will not generate a reset condition. RSTIN1  \nand RSTIN2 are each internally pulled up to VCC through a 100 k \uf057 resistor.Table 6.

RSTIN1 and RSTIN2 timing waveforms\n          \n4.8 Calibrating the clock \nThe M41T94 is driven by a quartz-controlled oscillator with a nominal frequency of \n32,768 Hz. Uncalibrated clock accuracy will not exceed ±35 ppm (parts per million) oscillator frequency error at 25°C, which equates to about ±1.53 minutes per month. When the Calibration circuit is properly employed, accuracy improves to better than ±2 ppm at 25°C.\nThe oscillation rate of crystals changes with temperature (see Figure 14 on page 24 ). \nTherefore, the M41T94 design employs periodic counter correction. The calibration circuit \nadds or subtracts counts from the oscillator divider circuit at the divide by 256 stage, as shown in Figure 15 on page 25 . The number of times pulses are blanked (subtracted, \nnegative calibration) or split (added, positive calibration) depends upon the value loaded into the five calibration bits found in the control register. Adding counts speeds the clock up, subtracting counts slows the clock down.\nThe calibration bits occupy the five lower order bits (D4-D0) in the control register (8h). \nThese bits can be set to represent any value between 0 and 31 in binary form. Bit D5 is a \nsign bit; '1' indicates positive calibration, '0' indicates negative calibration. Calibration occurs within a 64 minute cycle. The first 62 minutes in the cycle may, once per minute, have one second either shortened by 128 or lengthened by 256 oscillator cycles. If a binary '1' is loaded into the register, only the first 2 minutes in the 64 minute cycle will be modified; if a binary 6 is loaded, the first 12 will be affected, and so on.\nTherefore, each calibration step has the effect of adding 512 or subtracting 256 oscillator \ncycles for every 125,829,120 actual oscillator cycles, that is +4.068 or –2.034 ppm of Table 7.

Assuming that the oscillator is \nrunning at exactly 32,768 Hz, each of the 31 increments in the calibration byte would represent +10.7 or –5.35 seconds per month which corresponds to a total range of +5.5 or–2.75 minutes per month.\nTwo methods are available for ascertaining how much calibration a given M41T94 may \nrequire.\nThe first involves setting the clock, letting it run for a month and comparing it to a known \naccurate reference and recording deviation over a fixed period of time. Calibration values, including the number of seconds lost or gained in a given period, can be found in application note AN934: TIMEKEEPER\n® calibration. This allows the designer to give the end user the \nability to calibrate the clock as the environment requires, even if the final product is packaged in a non-user serviceable enclosure. The designer could provide a simple utility that accesses the calibration byte. \nThe second approach is better suited to a manufacturing environment, and involves the use \nof the \nIRQ/FT/OUT pin. The pin will toggle at 512 Hz, when the stop bit (ST, D7 of 1h) is '0,' \nthe frequency test bit (FT, D6 of 8h) is '1,' the alarm flag enable bit (AFE, D7 of Ah) is '0,' and the watchdog steering bit (WDS, D7 of 9h) is '1' or the watchdog register (9h = 0) is reset.\nAny deviation from 512 Hz indicates the degree and direction of oscillator frequency shift at \nthe test temperature. For example, a reading of 512.010124 Hz would indicate a +20 ppm oscillator frequency error, requiring a –10 (XX001010) to be loaded into the calibration byte for correction.\nNote: Setting or changing the calibration byte does not affect the frequency test output frequency.\nThe \nIRQ/FT/OUT pin is an open drain output which requires a pull-up resistor for proper \noperation. A 500 to 10 k \uf057 resistor is recommended in order to control the rise time. The FT \nbit is cleared on power-down.\nFigure 14.

Calibration waveform\n4.9 Century bit\nBits D7 and D6 of clock register 03h contain the CENTURY ENABLE bit (CEB) and the \nCENTURY bit (CB). Setting CEB to a '1' will cause CB to toggle, either from a '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0' at the turn of the century (depending upon its initial state). If CEB is set to a '0,' CB will not toggle.\n4.10 Output driver pin\nWhen the FT bit, AFE bit and watchdog register are not set, the IRQ/FT/OUT pin becomes \nan output driver that reflects the contents of D7 of the control register. In other words, when D7 (OUT bit) and D6 (FT bit) of address location 08h are a '0,' then the \nIRQ/FT/OUT pin will \nbe driven low.\nNote: The IRQ/FT/OUT pin is an open drain which requires an external pull-up resistor.\n4.11 Battery low warning\nThe M41T94 automatically performs battery voltage monitoring upon power-up and at \nfactory-programmed time intervals of approximately 24 hours. The battery low (BL) bit, bit D4 of flags register 0Fh, will be asserted if the battery voltage is found to be less than approximately 2.5 V. The BL bit will remain asserted until completion of battery replacement and subsequent battery low monitoring tests, either during the next power-up sequence or the next scheduled 24-hour interval.\nIf a battery low is generated during a power-up sequence, this indicates that the battery is \nbelow approximately 2.5 volts and may not be able to maintain data integrity in the SRAM. Data should be considered suspect and verified as correct. A fresh battery should be installed.\nIf a battery low indication is generated during the 24-hour interval check, this indicates that \nthe battery is near end of life. However, data is not compromised due to the fact that a nominal V\nCC is supplied. In order to insure data integrity during subsequent periods of \nbattery backup mode, the battery should be replaced. The SNAPHAT® top may be replaced \nwhile VCC is applied to the device.\nNote: This will cause the clock to lose time during the interval the SNAPHAT® battery/crystal top is \ndisconnected.AI00594BNORMAL\nPOSITIVECALIBRATION\nNEGATIVE\nCALIBRATION\nClock operations M41T94\n26/39 DocID007564 Rev 7The M41T94 only monitors the battery when a nominal VCC is applied to the device. Thus \napplications which require extensive durations in the battery backup mode should be powered-up periodically (at least once every few months) in order for this technique to be beneficial. Additionally, if a battery low is indicated, data integrity should be verified upon power-up via a checksum or other technique.\n4.12 tREC bit\nBit D7 of clock register 04h contains the tREC bit (TR). tREC refers to the automatic \ncontinuation of the deselect time after VCC reaches VPFD. This allows for a voltage setting \ntime before WRITEs may again be performed to the device after a power-down condition. \nThe tREC bit will allow the user to set the length of this deselect time as defined by Table 8 \non page 26 .\n4.13 Initial power-on defaults\nUpon initial application of power to the device, the following register bits are set to a '0' state: \nWatchdog register, TR, FT, AFE, ABE, and SQWE.
