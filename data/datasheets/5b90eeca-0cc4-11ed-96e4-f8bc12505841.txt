In a \ntypical implementation, motor currents flow through an \nexternal resistor and the resulting analog voltage drop is sensed by the HCPL-7840. A differential output voltage is \ncreated on the other side of the HCPL-7840 optical isolation \nbarrier. This differential output voltage is proportional to the motor current and can be converted to a single-ended signal \nby using an op-amp as shown in the recommended \napplication circuit. Since co mmon-mode voltage swings of \nseveral hundred volts in tens of nanoseconds are common \nin modern switching inverter motor drives, the HCPL-7840 \nwas designed to ignore very high common-mode transient slew rates (of at least 10 kV/ μs).\nThe high CMR capability of  the HCPL-7840 isolation \namplifier provides the precis ion and stability needed to \naccurately monitor motor current in high noise motor control \nenvironments, providing for smoother control (less torque \nripple ) in various types of motor control applications.\nThe product can also be used for general analog signal \nisolation applications requirin g high accuracy, stability, and \nlinearity under similarly severe noise conditions. For general applications, we recommend the HCPL-7840 (gain tolerance of ±5%). The HCPL-7840 uses sigma-delta ( Σ-Δ) \nanalog-to-digital converter te chnology, chopper stabilized \namplifiers, and a fully differenti al circuit topology fabricated \nusing the Broadcom 0.8- μm CMOS IC process. Together, \nthese features deliver unequaled isolation mode noise \nrejection, as well as excellent off set and gain accuracy and stability over time and temperature. Th is performance is \ndelivered in a compact, auto-insertable, industry-standard \n8-pin DIP package that meets worldwide regulatory safety standards.

Output noise comes from two primary sources: chopper noise an d sigma-delta quantization noise. Chopper noise results from cho pper \nstabilization of the output op-amps. It occurs at a specific fr equency (typically 400 kHz at room temperature) and is not atten uated by the \ninternal output filter. A filter circuit can be easily added to t he external post-amplifier to reduce the total rms output nois e. The internal output \nfilter does eliminate most, but not all, of the sigma-delta quantization noise. The magnitude of the output quantization noise is very small at \nlower frequencies (below 10 kHz) and increases with increasing frequency.VIN to VOUT Signal Delay (50% to 10%) tPD10 — 2.03 3.3 μs Measured at output of \nMC34081 in Figure 18 . \nVIN+ = 0 mV to 150 mV step.17, 18\nVIN to VOUT Signal Delay (50% to 50%) tPD50 — 3.47 5.6 μs\nVIN to VOUT Signal Delay (50% to 90%) tPD90 — 4.99 9.9 μs\nVOUT Rise/Fall Time (10% to 90%) tR/F — 2.96 6.6 μs\nCommon-Mode Transient I mmunity CMTI 10.0 15.0 — kV/ μsVCM = 1 kV, TA = 25°C 19 b\nb.

The amplit ude of the \nstep is adjusted until the differential output (VOUT+ –VOUT– ) exhibits more than a 200-mV deviation from the average output voltage for more \nthan 1 μs.

A floating power supply (which in many \napplications could be the same  supply that is used to drive \nthe high-side power transistor) is regulated to 5V using a \nsimple zener diode (D1); the value of resistor R4 should be chosen to supply sufficient current from the existing floating \nsupply. The voltage from the current sensing resistor \n(Rsense) is applied to the input of the HCPL-7840 through an RC anti-aliasing filter (R2 and C2). Although the \napplication circuit is re latively simple, a few \nrecommendations should be followed to ensure optimal performance.The power supply for the HCPL -7840 is most often ob- \ntained from the same supply used to power the power \ntransistor gate drive circuit. If a dedicated supply is re- \nquired, in many cases it is possible to add an additional winding on an existing transformer. Otherwise, some sort of \nsimple isolated supply can be used, such as a line powered \ntransformer or a high-frequency DC-DC converter.\nAn inexpensive 78L05 three-terminal regulator can also be \nused to reduce the floating supply voltage to 5V. To help \nattenuate high-frequency power supply noise or ripple, a resistor or inductor can be used in series with the input of \nthe regulator to form a low-pass filter with the regulator's \ninput bypass capacitor.\nFigure 20:  Recommended Supply and Sense Resistor Connections\nHCPL-7840C1\n0.1 μF\nR2\n39 ΩGATE DRIVE\nCIRCUITFLOATING\nPOWER\nSUPPLY •  •  •HV+\n•  •  •\nHV–•  •  •– +\nRSENSEMOTORC2\n0.01 μFD1\n5.1 V–+\nR1\nBroadcom AV02-1289EN\n14HCPL-7840  Data Sheet Isolation Amplifier\nAs shown in Figure 21 , 0.1-μF bypass capacitors (C1, C2) should be located as close as possible to the pins of the HCPL-\n7840. The bypass capacitors are required because of the high-s peed digital nature of the signals inside the HCPL-7840. A \n0.01-μF bypass capacitor (C2) is also recommended at the input be cause the switched-cap acitor also forms part of the anti-\naliasing filter, which is recommended to prevent high-frequency noise from aliasing down to lower frequencies and interfering \nwith the input signal. The input filter al so performs an important re liability function—it reduces transient spikes from ESD \nevents flowing through the current sensing resistor.\nFigure 21:  Recommended Application Circuit\n0.1 μF+5 V\nVOUT8\n7\n61\n3U2\n52\n4R1\n2.00 K+15 V\nC8\n0.1 μF\n0.1 μF\n-15 V–\n+MC34081R3\n10.0 K\nHCPL-7840C4\nR4\n10.0 KC6\n150 pFU3U1\n78L05\nIN      OUT\nC1 C2\n0.01\nμFR5\n68GATE DRIVE\nCIRCUITPOSITIVE\nFLOATING\nSUPPLY\n•  •  •HV+\n•  •  •\nHV–•  •  •– +\nRSENSEMOTORC5\n150 pF\n0.1\nμF0.1\nμF\nC3\nC7R2\n2.00 K\nPC Board Layout\nThe design of the printed circuit board (PCB) should follow \ngood layout practices, such  as keeping bypass capacitors \nclose to the supply pins, keeping output signals away from \ninput signals, the use of gr ound and power planes, and so \non. In addition, the layout of  the PCB can also affect the \nisolation transient immunity (CMTI) of the HCPL-7840, due \nprimarily to stray capacitive coupling between the input and \nthe output circuits. To obtain optimal CMTI performance, the \nlayout of the PC board should minimize any stray coupling \nby maintaining the maximum po ssible distance between the \ninput and output sides of the circuit and ensuring that any \nground or power plane on the PC board does not pass \ndirectly below or extend much wider than the body of the \nHCPL-7840Figure 22:  Example Printed Circuit Board Layout\nC3C2 C4R5\nTO R SENSE+\nTO R SENSE–TO V DD1\nTO V DD2\nVOUT+\nVOUT–\nHCPL-7840  Data Sheet Isolation Amplifier\nBroadcom AV02-1289EN\n15Current Sensing Resistors\nThe current sensing resistor should have low resistance (to \nminimize power dissipation), low inductance (to minimize di/dt induced voltage spikes which could adversely affect \noperation), and reasonable tolerance (to maintain overall \ncircuit accuracy). Choosing a particular value for the resistor is usually a compromise between minimizing power \ndissipation and maximizing accuracy. Smaller sense \nresistance decr eases power dissipation,  while larger sense \nresistance can impr ove circuit accuracy by utilizing the full \ninput range of the HCPL -7840.\nThe first step in selecting a se nse resistor is determining \nhow much current th e resistor will be sensing. The graph in \nFigure 23  shows the RMS current in each phase of a three-\nphase induction motor as a function of average motor output power (in horse-power, hp) and motor drive supply voltage. \nThe maximum value of the sense resistor is determined by \nthe current being measured and the maximum recommended input voltage of the isolation amplifier. The \nmaximum sense resistance can be  calculated by taking the \nmaximum recommended input voltage and dividing by the peak current that the sense resistor should see during \nnormal operation. For exam ple, if a motor will have a \nmaximum RMS current of 10A and can experience up to 50% overloads during normal operation, then the peak \ncurrent is 21.1A (= 10 × 1.414 × 1.5). Assuming a maximum \ninput voltage of 200 mV, the maximum value of sense resistance in this case  would be about 10 m Ω.\nFigure 23:  Motor Output Hors epower vs. Motor Phase Current \nand Supply VoltageThe maximum average power dissipation in the sense \nresistor can also be easily calculated by multiplying the \nsense resistance times the square of the maximum RMS \ncurrent, which is about 1W in the previous example. If the power dissipation in the sense resistor is too high, the \nresistance can be decreased below the maximum value to \ndecrease power dissipation. The minimum value of the sense resistor is limited by precision and accuracy \nrequirements of the design. As the resistance value is \nreduced, the output voltage ac ross the resistor is also \nreduced, which means that the offset and noise, which are \nfixed, become a larger percent age of the signal amplitude. \nThe selected value of the se nse resistor will fall somewhere \nbetween the minimum and maximum values, depending on \nthe particular requirement s of a specific design.\nWhen sensing currents large enough to cause significant \nheating of the sense resistor, the temperature coefficient \n(tempco) of the resistor can introduce nonlinearity due to the \nsignal dependent temperature rise of the resistor. The effect increases as the resistor-to-ambient thermal resistance \nincreases. This effect can be minimized by reducing the \nthermal resistance of the current sensing resistor or by using a resistor with a lower tempco. Lowering the thermal \nresistance can be accomplished by repositioning the current \nsensing resistor on the PC board, by using larger PC board traces to carry away more heat, or by using a heat sink.\nFor a two-terminal current sensing resistor, as the value of \nresistance decreases, the resi stance of the leads become a \nsignificant percentage of the total resistance. This has two \nprimary effects on resistor accuracy. First, the effective \nresistance of the sense resist or can become dependent on \nfactors such as how long the leads are, how they are bent, how far they are inserted into the board, and how far solder \nwicks up the leads during assembly (these issues will be \ndiscussed in more detail shortly). Second, the leads are typically made from a material, such as copper, which has a \nmuch higher tempco than the material from which the \nresistive element itself is made , resulting in a higher tempco \noverall.\nMOTOR PHASE CURRENT – A (rms)15\n540\n10 25 30035\n03 525\n10\n20440 V\n380 V220 V120 V\n30\n20\n5\n15\nHCPL-7840  Data Sheet Isolation Amplifier\nBroadcom AV02-1289EN\n16Both of these effects are eliminated when a four-terminal \ncurrent sensing resistor is used. A four-terminal resistor has \ntwo additional terminals that are Kelvin-connected directly \nacross the resistive element itself; these two terminals are used to monitor the voltage across the resi stive element \nwhile the other two terminals are used to carry the load \ncurrent. Because of the Kelvin connection, any voltage drops across the leads carrying the load current should \nhave no impact on the measured voltage.\nWhen laying out a PC board for the current sensing \nresistors, a couple of points should be kept in mind. The \nKelvin connections to the resistor should be brought \ntogether under the body of the resistor and then run very close to each other to the input of the HCPL-7840; this \nminimizes the loop area of the connection and reduces the \npossibility of stray magnetic fiel ds from interf ering with the \nmeasured signal. If the sense resistor is not located on the \nsame PC board as the HCPL-7840 circuit, a tightly twisted \npair of wires can accomplish the same thing.\nAlso, multiple layers of the PC board can be used to \nincrease current carrying capacity. Numerous plated- \nthrough vias should surround each non-Kelvin terminal of the sense resistor to help dist ribute the current between the \nlayers of the PC board. The PC board should use 2 oz. or \n4 oz. copper for the layers, resulting in a current carrying capacity in excess of 20A. Making the current carrying \ntraces on the PC board fairly large can also improve the \nsense resistor's power dissipation capability by acting as a heat sink. Liberal use of vias where the load current enters \nand exits the PC board is also recommended.\nSense Resistor Connections\nThe recommended method for connecting the HCPL-7840 \nto the current sensing resistor is shown in Figure 21 . VIN+ \n(pin 2 of the HPCL-7840) is connected to the positive \nterminal of the sense resistor, while VIN– (pin 3) is shorted to \nGND1 (pin 4), with the power-supply return path functioning \nas the sense line to the negative terminal of the current \nsense resistor. This allows a single pair of wires or PC board traces to connect the HCPL-7840 circuit to the sense \nresistor. By referencing the input circuit to the negative side \nof the sense resistor, any load current induced noise transients on the resistor are seen as a common-mode \nsignal and will not interfere with the current-sense signal. This is important because the large load currents flowing \nthrough the motor drive, along with the parasitic inductances \ninherent in the wiring of the circuit, can generate both noise \nspikes and offsets that are relatively large compared to the small voltages that are being measured across the current \nsensing resistor.\nIf the same power supply is used both for the gate drive \ncircuit and for the current sensin g circuit, it is very important \nthat the connection from GN D1 of the HCPL-7840 to the \nsense resistor be the only return path for supply current to the gate drive power supply in order to eliminate potential \nground loop problems. The only direct connection between \nthe HCPL-7840 circuit and the gate drive circuit should be the positive power supply line.\nOutput Side\nThe op-amp used in the external post-amplifier circuit should be of sufficiently high precision so that it does not \ncontribute a significant amount of offset or offset drift relative \nto the contribution from the isolation amplifier. Generally, op-amps with bipolar input stages exhibit better offset \nperformance than op-amps with JFET or MOSFET input \nstages.\nIn addition, the op-amp should also have enough bandwidth \nand slew rate so that it do es not adversely affect the \nresponse speed of the overall circuit. The post-amplifier circuit includes a pair of capa citors (C5 and C6) that form a \nsingle-pole low-pass filter; these capacitors allow the \nbandwidth of the post-amp to be adjusted independently of the gain and are useful for reducing the output noise from the isolation amplifier. Many different op-amps could be \nused in the circuit, including MC34082A (Motorola), \nTLO32A, TLO52A, and TLC277 (Texas Instruments), LF412A (National Semiconductor).\nThe gain-setting resistors in the post-amp should have a \ntolerance of 1% or better to ensure adequate CMRR and adequate gain tolerance for the overall circuit. Resistor \nnetworks can be used that have much better ratio toler- \nances than can be achieved using discrete resistors. A resistor network also reduces the total number of \ncomponents for the circuit as well as the required board \nspace.\nRefer to the Broadcom Application Note 1078 for additional \ninformation on using isolation amplifiers.\nBroadcom AV02-1289EN\n17HCPL-7840  Data Sheet Isolation Amplifier\nFrequently Asked Questions about the HCPL-7840\nThe Basics\n1. Why should I use the HCPL-7840 for sensing current when Hall- effect sensors are available which don't need an isolated \nsupply voltage?\nAvailable in an auto-insertable, 8-pin DIP package, the HCPL- 7840 is smaller than and has better linearity, offset vs. \ntemperature and Common Mode Rejection (CMR) performance th an most Hall-effect sensors. Additionally, often the \nrequired input-side power supply can be derived from th e same supply that powers the gate-drive optocoupler.\nSense Resistor and Input Filter\n2. Where do I get 10 m Ω resistors? I have never seen one that low.\nAlthough less common than values above 10 Ω, there are quite a few manufacturers of resistors suitable for measuring \ncurrents up to 50A when combined with the HCPL- 7840.\nExample product information may be found at Dale's web site ( https://www.vishay.com/resistors-fixed/current-sensing ) \nand Isotek's web site ( https://www.testco-inc.com/isotek ).\n3. Should I connect both inputs across t he sense resistor instead of grounding VIN– directly to pin 4?\nThis is not necessary, but it will work. If you do , be sure to use an RC filter on both pin 2 (VIN+) and pin 3 (VIN–) to limit \nthe input voltage at both pads.\n4. Do I really need an RC filter on the input? What is it for? Are other values of R and C okay?\nThe input anti-aliasi ng filter (R = 39 Ω, C = 0.01 μF) shown in the typical application ci rcuit is recommended for fil- tering \nfast switching voltage transients from th e input signal. (This helps to attenuate higher signal frequencies, which could \notherwise alias with the input sampling rate and cause higher input offset voltage.)\nSome issues to keep in mind using diff erent filter resistors or capacitors are:\n\uf06c(Filter resistor:) Input bias current for pins 2 and 3: This is on the order of 500 nA. If you are using a single filter \nresistor in series with pin 2 but not pin 3 the IxR drop acro ss this resistor will add to t he offset error of the device. \nAs long as this IR drop is small compared to the input offset voltage there should not be a problem. If larger- \nvalued resistors are used in series, it is better to put half of the resistance in series with pin 2 and half the \nresistance in series with pin 3. In this  case, the offset voltage is due mainly  to resistor mismat ch (typically less \nthan 1% of the resistance design value) multiplied by the input bias.\n\uf06c(Filter resistor:) The equivalent input resistance for –7840 is around 500 k Ω. It is therefore best to ensure that the \nfilter resistance is not a si gnificant percentage of  this value; otherwise the offset  voltage will be increased through \nthe resistor divider effect. [As an example, if Rfilt = 5.5 kΩ, then VOS   = (VIN × 1%) = 2 mV for a maximum 200 mV \ninput and VOS will vary with respect with VIN.]\n\uf06cThe input bandwidth is changed as a result of this different R-C filter configurat ion. In fact, this is one of the main \nreasons for changing the input-filter R-C time constant.\n\uf06c(Filter capacitance:) The input capacit ance of the –78XX is approximately 1.5 pF. For proper operation the \nswitching input-side sampling capacitors must be charged fr om a relatively fixed (low impedance) voltage source. \nTherefore, if a filter capacito r is used it is best for this capacitor to be a few orders of magnitude greater than the \nCINPUT (a value of at least 100 pF works well.)\n5. How do I ensure that the HCPL-7840 is not destroyed as a re sult of short circuit conditions which cause voltage drops \nacross the sense resistor that exceed the ratings of the HCPL-7840's inputs?\nSelect the sense resistor  so that it will have less than 5V drop when shor t circuits occur. The onl y other requirement is \nto shut down the drive before the sense resistor is damaged or  its solder joints melt. This ensures that the input of the \nHCPL-7840 cannot be damaged by sense resistors going open-circuit.\nBroadcom AV02-1289EN\n18HCPL-7840  Data Sheet Isolation Amplifier\nIsolation and Insulation\n6. How many volts will t he HCPL-7840 withstand?\nThe momentary (1 minute) withstand voltage is 3750 Vrms per UL 1577 and CSA Component Acceptance Notice #5.\nAccuracy\n7. Can the signal to noise ratio be improved?\nYes. Some noise energy exists beyond t he 100-kHz bandwidth of the HCPL-7800(A). Additional filtering using different \nfilter R,C values in the post-amplifier app lication circuit can be used to improve th e signal to noise ratio. For example, by \nusing values of R3 = R4 = 10 k Ω, C5 = C6 = 470 pF in the ap plication circuit the rms outpu t noise will be cut roughly by \na factor of 2. In applications needing only a few kHz b andwidth even better noise performance can be obtained. The \nnoise spectral density is roughly 500 nV/ √ Hz below 20 kHz (input referred).\n8. I need 1% tolerance on gain. Does Broadcom sell a more precise version?\nThe HCPL-7800A is gain-trimmed and matched to within ±1% tolerance (at room temperature). \n9. Does the gain change if the internal LED light output degrades with time?\nNo. The LED is used only to transmit a digital pattern. Br oadcom has accounted for LED degradation in the design of the \nproduct to ensure long life.\nPower Supplies and Start-up\n10. What are the output voltages before the input side power supply is turned on?\nVO+ is close to 1.29V and VO– is close to 3.80V. This is equivalent to th e output response at the condition that LED is \ncompletely off.\n11. How long does the HCPL-7840 take to begin working properly after power-up?\nWithin 1 ms after VDD1 and VDD2 powered the device starts to work. But it takes longer time for output to settle down \ncompletely. In case of the offset measurement while bo th inputs are tied to ground, there is initially VOS adjustment (about \n60 ms). The output completely settles dow n in 100 ms after device powering up.\nMiscellaneous\n12. How does the HCPL-7840 measure negat ive signals with only a +5V supply?\nThe inputs have a series resistor for pr otection against large negative inputs. No rmal signals are no more than 200 mV \nin amplitude. Such signals do not forward bias any junction s sufficiently to in terfere with accurate operation of the \nswitched capacitor input circuit.\nBroadcom, the pulse logo, Connecting everything, Avago Tech nologies, Avago, and the A logo are among the trademarks \nof Broadcom and/or its affiliates in the United States, certain ot her countries, and/or the EU. \nCopyright © 2005-2021 Broadcom.
