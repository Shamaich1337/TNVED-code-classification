They arespecifically designed for Off −Line and DC −to−DC\nconverter applications offering the designer a cost−effective\nsolution with minimal external components.A representative block diagram is shown in Figure 19.\nOscillator\nThe oscillator frequency is programmed by the values\nchosen for the timing components R T and C T. It must also be\nnoted that the value of R T uniquely determines the\nmaximum duty ratio of UC384xx. The oscillatorconfiguration depicting the connection of the timingcomponents to the R\nT/CT pin of the controller is shown in\nFigure 18. Capacitor C T gets charged from the V ref source,\nthrough resistor R T to its peak threshold V RT/CT(peak) ,\ntypically 2.8 V . Upon reaching this peak threshold volage, an\ninternal 8.3 mA current source, I dischg , is enabled and the\nvoltage across C T begins to decrease. Once the voltage\nacross C T reaches its valley threshold, V RT/CT(valley) ,\ntypically 1.2 V , I dischg  turns off. This allows capacitor C T to\ncharge up again from V ref. This entire cycle repeats, and the\nresulting waveform on the R T/CT pin has a sawtooth shape.\nTypical waveforms are shown in Figure 20.\nThe oscillator thresholds are temperature compensated to\nwithin ±6% at 50 kHz . Considering the general industry\ntrend of operating switching controllers at higher\nfrequencies, the UC384xx is guaranteed to operate within\n±10% at 250 kHz . These internal circuit refinements\nminimize variations of oscillator frequency and maximum\nduty ratio.\nThe charging and discharging times of the timing\ncapacitor C T are calculated using Equations 1 and 2. These\nequations do not take into account the propagation delays of\nthe internal comparator. Hence, at higher frequencies, thecalculated value of the oscillator frequency differs from the\nactual value.\ntRT/C0324CT(chg) /C0043RTCTln/C0466VRT/C0324CT(valley) /C0042Vref\nVRT/C0324CT(peak) /C0042Vref/C0467 (eq. 1)\ntRT/C0324CT(dischg) /C0043RTCTln/C0466RTIdischg/C0041VRT/C0324CT(peak) /C0042Vref\nRTIdischg/C0041VRT/C0324CT(valley) /C0042Vref/C0467\n(eq. 2)\nThe maximum duty ratio, Dmax is given by Equation 3.\nDmax/C0043tRT/C0324CT(chg)\ntRT/C0324CT(chg) /C0041tRT/C0324CT(dischg)(eq. 3)\nSubstituting Equations 1 and 2 into Equation 3, and after\nalgebraic simplification, we obtainDmax/C0043ln/C0466VRT/C0324CT(valley)/C0042Vref\nVRT/C0324CT(peak)/C0042Vref/C0467\nln/C0466VRT/C0324CT(valley)/C0042Vref\nVRT/C0324CT(peak)/C0042Vref/C0064RTIdischg/C0041VRT/C0324CT(peak)/C0042Vref\nRTIdischg/C0041VRT/C0324CT(valley)/C0042Vref/C0467\n(eq. 4)\nClearly, the maximum duty ratio is determined by the\ntiming resistor R T. Therefore, R T is chosen such as to\nachieve a desired maximum duty ratio. Once R T has been\nselected, C T can now be chosen to obtain the desired\nswitching frequency as per Equation 5.\nf/C00431\nRTCTln/C0466VRT/C0324CT(valley)/C0042Vref\nVRT/C0324CT(peak)/C0042Vref/C0064RTIdischg/C0041VRT/C0324CT(peak)/C0042Vref\nRTIdischg/C0041VRT/C0324CT(valley)/C0042Vref/C0467\n(eq. 5)\nFigure 2 shows the frequency and maximum duty ratio\nvariation  versus R T for given values of C T. Care should be\ntaken to ensure that the absolute minimum value of R T\nshould not be less than 542 /C0087. However, considering a 10%\ntolerance for the timing resistor, the nearest available\nstandard resistor of 680 /C0087 is the absolute minimum that can\nbe used to guarantee normal oscillator operation. If a timing\nresistor smaller than this value is used, then the chargingcurrent through the R\nT, CT path will exceed the pulldown\n(discharge) current and the oscillator will get permanently\nlocked/latched to an undefined state.\nIn many noise-sensitive applications it may be desirable\nto frequency-lock the converter to an external system clock.\nThis can be accomplished by applying a clock signal to  the\ncircuit shown in Figure 22. For reliable synchronization, the\nfree-running oscillator frequency should be set about 10%less than the clock frequency. A method for multi-unitsynchronization is shown in Figure 23. By tailoring the\nclock waveform, accurate Output duty ratio clamping can be\nachieved.\nEnableIdischgVref\nRT/CTRT\nCT2.8 V\n1.2 V\nFigure 18.

It features a typicalDC voltage gain of 90 dB, and a unity gain bandwidth of1.0 MHz with 57 degrees of phase margin (Figure 8). Thenon−inverting input is internally biased at 2.5 V and is not\npinned out. The converter output voltage is typically divided\ndown and monitored by the inverting input. The maximum\ninput bias current is −2.0 /C0109A which can cause an output\nvoltage error that is equal to the product of the input biascurrent and the equivalent input divider source resistance.\nThe Error Amp Output (Pin 1) is provided for external\nloop compensation (Figure 33). The output voltage is offset\nby two diode drops ( ≈1.4 V) and divided by three before it\nconnects to the non −inverting input of the Current Sense\nComparator. This guarantees that no drive pulses appear atthe Output (Pin 6) when pin 1 is at its lowest state (V\nOL).\nThis occurs when the power supply is operating and the load\nis removed, or at the beginning of a soft −start interval\n(Figures 25, 26). The Error Amp minimum feedbackresistance is limited by the amplifier’s source current(0.5 mA) and the required output voltage (V\nOH) to reach the\ncomparator’s 1.0 V clamp level:\nRf(min) ≈3.0 (1.0 V) + 1.4 V\n0.5 mA= 8800  /C0087\nCurrent Sense Comparator and PWM Latch\nThe UC3842B, UC3843B operate as a current mode\ncontroller, whereby output switch conduction is initiated by\nthe oscillator and terminated when the peak inductor currentreaches the threshold level established by the Error\nAmplifier Output/Compensation (Pin 1). Thus the error\nsignal controls the peak inductor current on acycle−by−cycle basis. The Current Sense Comparator PWM\nLatch configuration used ensures that only a single pulseappears at the Output during any given oscillator cycle. The\ninductor current is converted to a voltage by inserting theground−referenced sense resistor R\nS in series with the\nsource of output switch Q1. This voltage is monitored by the\nCurrent Sense Input (Pin 3) and compared to a level derived\nfrom the Error Amp Output. The peak inductor current under\nnormal operating conditions is controlled by the voltage atpin 1 where:\nIpk =V(Pin 1) − 1.4 V\n3 RS\nAbnormal operating conditions occur when the power\nsupply output is overloaded or if output voltage sensing islost. Under these conditions, the Current Sense Comparator\nthreshold will be internally clamped to 1.0 V . Therefore the\nmaximum peak switch current is:\nIpk(max)  =1.0 V\nRS\nWhen designing a high power switching regulator it\nbecomes desirable to reduce the internal clamp voltage inorder to keep the power dissipation of R\nS to a reasonable\nlevel. A simple method to adjust this voltage is shown inFigure 24. The two external diodes are used to compensatethe internal diodes, yielding a constant clamp voltage overtemperature. E rratic operation due to noise pickup can result\nif there is an excessive reduction of the I\npk(max)  clamp\nvoltage.\nA narrow spike on the leading edge of the current\nwaveform can usually be observed and may cause the power\nsupply to exhibit an instability when the output is lightlyloaded. This spike is due to the power transformerinterwinding capacitance and output rectifier recovery time.\nThe addition of an RC filter on the Current Sense Input witha time constant that approximates the spike duration will\nusually eliminate the instability (refer to Figure 28).\nUC3842B, UC3843B, UC2842B, UC2843B\nwww. onsemi.com\n10+\n-Reference\nRegulator\nVCC\nUVLO\n+\n-Vref\nUVLO3.6V36V\nS\nRQInternal\nBias\n+1.0mAOscillator2.5VR\nR\nR2R\nError\nAmplifierVoltage\nFeedback\nInput\nOutput/\nCompensationCurrent Sense\nComparator1.0VVCC      7(12)\nGND       5(9)VC\n7(11)\nOutput\n6(10)\nPower Ground5(8)\nCurrent Sense Input3(5)R\nSQ1VCC Vin\n1(1)2(3)4(7)8(14)\nRT\nCTVref\n= Sink Only Positive True Logic Pin numbers adjacent to terminals are for the 8-pin dual-in-line package.\nPin numbers in parenthesis are for the D suffix SOIC-14 package.\nFigure 19.

The positive powersupply terminal (V\nCC) and the reference output (V ref) are\neach monitored by separate comparators. Each has built−in\nhysteresis to prevent erratic output behavior as their\nrespective thresholds are crossed. The V CC comparator\nupper and lower thresholds are 16 V/10 V for the UCX842B,\nand 8.4 V/7.6 V for the UCX843B. The V ref comparator\nupper and lower thresholds are 3.6 V/3.4 V . The largehysteresis and low startup current of the UCX842B makesit ideally suited in off −line converter applications where\nefficient bootstrap startup techniques are required\n(Figure 35). The UCX843B is intended for lower voltage\nDC−to−DC converter applications. A 36 V Zener is\nconnected as a shunt regulator from V\nCC to ground. Its\npurpose is to protect the IC from excessive voltage that can\noccur during system startup. The minimum operatingvoltage (V\nCC) for the UCX842B is 11 V and 8.2 V for the\nUCX843B.\nThese devices contain a single totem pole output stage that\nwas specifically designed for direct drive of power\nMOSFETs. It is capable of up to ±1.0 A peak drive current\nand has a typical rise and fall time of 50 ns with a 1.0 nF load.Additional internal circuitry has been added to keep theOutput in a sinking mode whenever an undervoltage lockout\nis active. This characteristic eliminates the need for anexternal pull −down resistor.\nThe SOIC −14 surface mount package provides separate\npins for V\nC (output supply) and Power Ground. Proper\nimplementation will significantly reduce the level ofswitching transient noise imposed on the control circuitry.This becomes particularly useful when reducing the I\npk(max)\nclamp level. The separate V C supply input allows the\ndesigner added flexibility in tailoring the drive voltageindependent of V\nCC. A Zener clamp is typically connected\nto this input when driving power MOSFETs in systems\nwhere V CC is greater than 20 V . Figure 27 shows proper\npower and control ground connections in a current−sensing\npower MOSFET application.\nReference\nThe 5.0 V bandgap reference is trimmed to ±1.0%\ntolerance at T J = 25 °C on the UC284XB, and ±2.0% on the\nUC384XB. Its primary purpose is to supply char ging current\nto the oscillator timing capacitor . The reference has short−\ncircuit protection and is capable of providing in excess of20 mA for powering additional control system circuitry.Design Considerations\nDo not attempt to construct the converter on\nwire−wrap or plug −in prototype boards.  High frequency\ncircuit layout techniques are imperative to preventpulse−width jitter. This is usually caused by excessive noise\npick−up imposed on the Current Sense or V oltage Feedback\ninputs. Noise immunity can be improved by lowering circuit\nimpedances at these points. The printed circuit layout should\ncontain a ground plane with low −current signal and\nhigh−current switch and output grounds returning on\nseparate paths back to the input filter capacitor. Ceramic\nbypass capacitors (0.1 /C0109F) connected directly to V\nCC, VC,\nand V ref may be required depending upon circuit layout.\nThis provides a low impedance path for filtering the high\nfrequency noise. All high current loops should be kept as\nshort as possible using heavy copper runs to minimizeradiated EMI. The Error Amp compensation circuitry andthe converter output voltage divider should be located closeto the IC and as far as possible from the power switch andother noise −generating components.\nCurrent mode converters can exhibit subharmonic\noscillations when operating at a duty cycle greater than 50%\nwith continuous inductor current. This instability is\nindependent of the regulator’s closed loop characteristicsand is caused by the simultaneous operating conditions offixed frequency and peak current detecting. Figure 21Ashows the phenomenon graphically. At t\n0, switch\nconduction begins, causing the inductor current to rise at aslope of m\n1. This slope is a function of the input voltage\ndivided by the inductance. At t 1, the Current Sense Input\nreaches the threshold established by the control voltage.\nThis causes the switch to turn off and the current to decay at\na slope of m 2, until the next oscillator cycle. The unstable\ncondition can be shown if a perturbation is added to the\ncontrol voltage, resulting in a small /C0068I (dashed line). With\na fixed oscillator period, the current decay time is reduced,and the minimum current at switch turn −on (t\n2) is increased\nby /C0068I + /C0068I m2/m1. The minimum current at the next cycle\n(t3) decreases to ( /C0068I + /C0068I m2/m1) (m 2/m1). This perturbation\nis multiplied by m 2/m1 on each succeeding cycle, alternately\nincreasing and decreasing the inductor current at switchturn−on. Several oscillator cycles may be required before\nthe inductor current reaches zero causing the process tocommence again. If m\n2/m1 is greater than 1, the converter\nwill be unstable. Figure 21B shows that by adding anartificial ramp that is synchronized with the PWM clock to\nthe control voltage, the /C0068I perturbation will decrease to zero\non succeeding cycles. This compensating ramp (m\n3) must\nhave a slope equal to or slightly greater than m 2/2 for\nstability. With m 2/2 slope compensation, the average\ninductor current follows the control voltage, yielding truecurrent mode operation. The compensating ramp can bederived from the oscillator and added to either the V oltageFeedback or Current Sense inputs (Figure 34).\nUC3842B, UC3843B, UC2842B, UC2843B\nwww. onsemi.com\n12Figure 21.
