The device operates from a single 3.3V or 5.0Vpower supply and includes one differential line driver andone receiver. The DS90LV019 features an independentdriver and receiver with TTL/CMOS compatibility (D\nINand\nROUT). The logic interface provides maximum flexibility as 4\nseparate lines are provided (DIN, DE, RE, and ROUT). The\ndevice also features a flow-through pin out which allowseasy PCB routing for short stubs between its pins and theconnector. The driver has 3.5 mA output loop current.\nThe driver translates between TTL levels (single-ended) to\nLowVoltageDifferentialSignalinglevels.Thisallowsforhighspeed operation, while consuming minimal power with re-duced EMI. In addition, the differential signaling providescommon-mode noise rejection.\nThe receiver threshold is\n±100 mV over a ±1V common-\nmode range and translates the low swing differential levelsto standard (TTL/CMOS) levels.Features\nnLVDS Signaling\nn3.3V or 5.0V operation\nnLow power CMOS design\nnBalanced Output Impedance\nnGlitch free power up/down (Driver disabled)\nnHigh Signaling Rate Capacity (above 100 Mbps)\nnUltra Low Power Dissipation\nn±1V Common-Mode Range\nn±100 mV Receiver Sensitivity\nnProduct offered in SOIC and TSSOP packages\nnFlow-Through Pin Out\nnIndustrial Temperature Range Operation\nConnection Diagram\nBlock Diagram\nTRI-STATE®is a registered trademark of National Semiconductor Corporation.\nDS100053-1\nOrder Number DS90LV019TM or DS90LV019TMTC\nSee NS Package Number M14A or MTC14\nDS100053-2\nAugust 2000DS90LV019 3.3V or 5V LVDS Driver/Receiver\n© 2000 National Semiconductor Corporation DS100053 www.national.com\nAbsolute Maximum Ratings (Note 1)\nIf Military/Aerospace specified devices are required,\npleasecontacttheNationalSemiconductorSalesOffice/Distributors for availability and specifications.\nSupply Voltage V\nCC 6.0V\nEnable Input Voltage (DE, RE) −0.3V to (VCC+0.3V)\nDriver Input Voltage (DIN) −0.3V to (VCC+ 0.3V)\nReceiver Output Voltage\n(ROUT) −0.3V to (VCC+ 0.3V)\nDriver Output Voltage (DO ±) −0.3V to +3.9V\nReceiver Input Voltage (RI ±) −0.3V to (VCC+ 0.3V)\nDriver Short Circuit Current ContinuousESD (Note 4)\n(HBM, 1.5 k Ω, 100 pF)\n>2.0 kV\n(EIAJ, 0 Ω, 200 pF) >200 V\nMaximum Package Power Dissipation at 25˚C\nSOIC 960 mWDerate SOIC Package 7.7mW/˚C\nTSSOP 790 mWDerate TSSOP Package 6.3mW/˚C\nStorage Temperature Range −65˚C to +150˚CLead Temperature\n(Soldering, 4 sec.) 260˚C\nRecommended Operating\nConditions\nMin Max Units\nSupply Voltage (VCC) or 3.0 3.6 V\nSupply Voltage (VCC) 4.5 5.5 V\nReceiver Input Voltage 0.0 2.4 VOperating Free Air\nTemperature T\nA −40 +85 ˚C\nDC Electrical Characteristics\nTA= −40˚C to +85˚C unless otherwise noted, VCC= 3.3±0.3V.

There are a few common practiceswhich should be implied when designing PCB for LVDS sig-naling. Recommended practices are:\n•Use at least 4 PCB board layer (LVDS signals, ground,power and TTL signals).\n•Keep drivers and receivers as close to the (LVDS portside) connector as possible.\n•Bypass each LVDS device and also use distributed bulkcapacitance. Surface mount capacitors placed close topower and ground pins work best. Two or three multi-layer ceramic (MLC) surface mount capacitors 0.1 µF,and0.01µFinparallelshouldbeusedbetweeneachV\nCC\nand ground. The capacitors should be as close as pos-\nsible to the VCCpin.\n•Use controlled impedance traces which match the differ-ential impedance of your transmission medium (i.e.,Cable) and termination resistor.\n•Use the termination resistor which best matches the dif-ferential impedance of your transmission line.\n•Isolate TTL signals from LVDS signals.\nMEDIA (CABLE AND CONNECTOR) SELECTION:\n•Use controlled impedance media. The cables and con-\nnectors should have a matched differential impedance ofabout 100 Ω.\nDS100053-11\nFIGURE 9. Receiver TRI-STATE Delay Waveforms TRI-STATE Delay Waveforms\nDS100053-13\nFIGURE 10.

For distances 0.5m ≤d≤10m, CAT 3\n(category 3) twisted pair cable works well and is readilyavailable and relatively inexpensive.
