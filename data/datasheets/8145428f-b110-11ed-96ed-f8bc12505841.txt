B1 2 \n09/20/2020  \nGEN ERAL DESCRIPTION \n \nThe IS25LP 016D  and IS25WP 016D  Serial Flash memory offers a versatile storage solution with high flexibility and \nperformance in a simplified pin count package. ISSI’s “Indus try Standard Serial Interface” F lash is for systems that \nrequire  limited space, a low pin count , and low power  consumption . The device  is accessed through a 4 -wire SPI \nInterface c onsisting of a Serial Data Input ( SI), Serial Data Output (SO), Serial Clock (SCK), and Chip Enable \n(CE#) pins, whi ch can also be configured to serve as multi -I/O (see pin descriptions).  \n \nThe device supports  Dual and Quad I/O as well as standard , Dual Outp ut, and Quad Output SPI. Clock frequencies \nof up to 133MHz allow for equivalent clock rates of up to 532MHz (133MHz x 4) which equates to  66Mb ytes/s  of \ndata throughput. The IS25xP series of F lash adds support for DTR  (Double Transfer  Rate ) commands that tr ansfer \naddress es and read data on both edges of the clock.  These transfer rates can outperform 16 -bit Parallel Flash \nmemories allowing for efficient memory access to support XIP  (execute in place) operation.  \n \nInitial state of the memory array is erased (all bits are set to 1) when shipped from the factory.  \n \nQPI (Quad Periphe ral Interface) supports 2 -cycle instruction further reducing instruction times. Pages can be \nerased in groups of 4K byte sectors, 32K byte b locks, 64K byte blocks, and/or the entire chip. The uniform sector \nand block  architecture  allow s for a high degree of flexibility so that the device can be utilized for a broad variety of \napplications requiring solid data retention.  \n \nGLOSSARY  \n \nStandard  SPI \nIn this operation, a 4 -wire SPI Interface is utilized, consisting of Serial Data Input  (SI), Serial Data Output (SO), \nSerial Clock (SCK), and Chip Enable (CE#) pins. Instructions are sent via the SI pin to encode instructions, \naddresses, or input data to t he device on the rising edge of SCK. The SO pin is used to read data or to check the \nstatus of the device. This device supports SPI bus operation modes (0,  0) and (1,  1). \n \nMulti  I/O SPI \nMulti -I/O operation utilizes an  enhanced SPI protocol to allow the dev ice to function with Dual Output, Dual Input \nand Output, Quad Output, and Quad Input and Output capability. Executing these instructions through SPI mode \nwill achieve double or quadruple the transfer bandwidth for READ and PROGRAM operations.  \n \nQPI \nThe device supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) operations only when the device is switched from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using the enter QPI (35h) instruction. The typical SPI protocol requires \nthat the byte -long instruction code being shifted into the device only via SI pin in eight serial clocks. The QPI mode \nutilizes all four I/O pins to input the instruction code thus requiring only two serial clocks. This can significantly \nreduce the SPI instruction overhead and improve system performance. Only QPI mode or SPI/Dual/Quad mode \ncan be active at any given time. Enter QPI (35h) and Exit QPI (F5h) instructions are used to switch between these \ntwo modes, regardless of the non -volatible Quad Enable (QE) bit status in the Status Register. Power Reset  or \nSoftware Reset will return the device into the standard SPI mode. SI and SO pins become bidirectional I/O0 and \nI/O1, and WP# and HOLD# pins become I/O2 and I/O3 respectively during QPI mode.  \n \nDTR \nIn addition to SPI and QPI features, the device also supports Fast READ DTR operation . Fast READ DTR operation  \nallows high data throughput while running at lower clock frequencies. Fast READ DTR operation  uses both rising \nand fall ing edges of the clock for address inputs, and data output s, resulting in reducing input and output cycles by \nhalf. \n \n \n  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       4   \nRev.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \nFor the device with Hold#/ RESET#  \nSYMBOL  TYPE  DESCRIPTION  \nCE# INPUT  Chip Enable:  The Chip Enable (CE#) pin enables and disables the devices \noperation. When CE# is high the device is deselected and output pins are in a high \nimpedance state. When deselected the devices non -critical internal circuitry power \ndown to allow minimal levels o f power consumption while in a standby state.  \nWhen CE# is pulled low the device will be selected and brought out of standby mode. \nThe device is considered active and instructions can be written to, data read, and \nwritten to the device. After power -up, CE# must transition from high to low before a \nnew instruction will be accepted.  \nKeeping CE# in a high state deselects the device and switches it into its low power \nstate. Data will not be accepted when CE# is high.  \nSI (IO0),  \nSO (IO1)  INPUT/OUTPUT  Serial Data  Input, Serial Output, and IOs (SI, SO, IO0, and IO1):  \nThis device supports standard SPI, Dual SPI, and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI \ninstructions use the unidirectional SI (Serial Input) pin to write instructions, \naddresses, or data to the device on th e rising edge of the Serial Clock (SCK). \nStandard SPI also uses the unidirectional SO (Serial Output) to read data or status \nfrom the device on the falling edge of the serial clock (SCK).  \nIn Dual and Quad SPI mode, SI and SO become bidirectional IO pins to  write \ninstructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of the Serial Clock \n(SCK) and read data or status from the device on the falling edge of SCK. Quad SPI \ninstructions use the WP# and HOLD# pins as IO2 and IO3 respectively.  \nWP# (IO 2) INPUT/OUTPUT  Write Protect/Serial Data IO (IO2):  The WP# pin protects the Status Register from \nbeing written in conjunction with the SRWD bit. When the SRWD is set to “1” and the \nWP# is pulled low, the Status Register bits (SRWD, QE, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0)  are \nwrite -protected and vice -versa for WP# high. When the SRWD is set to “0”, the Status \nRegister is not write -protected regardless of WP# state.  \nWhen the QE bit is set to “1”, the WP# pin (Write Protect) function is not available \nsince this pin is used for IO2. \nHOLD# or \nRESET# (IO3) INPUT/OUTPUT  HOLD# or RESET#/Serial Data IO (IO3):  When the QE bit of Status Register is set \nto “1”, HOLD# pin or RESET# is not available since it becomes IO3. When QE=0, the \npin acts as HOLD# or RESET# and either one can be selected by the P7 bit setting \nin Read Register. HOLD# will be selected if P7=0 (Default) and RESET# will be \nselected if P7=1 . \nThe HOLD# pin allows the device to be paused while it is selected. It p auses serial \ncommunication by the master device without re setting the serial sequence. The \nHOLD# pin is active low. When HOLD# is in a low state and CE# is low, the SO pin \nwill be at high impedance. Device operation can resume when HOLD# pin is brought \nto a high state.  \nRESET# pin is a hardware RESET signal. When RESET# is driven HIGH, the \nmemory is in the normal operating mode. When RESET# is driven LOW, the memory \nenters reset mode and output is High -Z. If RESET# is driven LOW while an internal \nWRITE, PROGRAM, or ERASE operation is in progress, data may be lost.  \nSCK INPUT  Serial Data Clock:  Synchronized Clock for input and output timing operations.  \nVcc POWER  Power:  Device Core Power Supply  \nGND  GROUND  Ground:  Connect to ground when referenced to Vcc  \nNC Unused  NC: Pins labeled “NC” stand for “No Connect” and should be left unconnected.  \n \n \n  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       10   \nRev.

SPI MODES DESCRIPTION  \nMultiple IS25LP 016D  devices  or multiple IS25WP 016D  devices can be connected on the SPI serial bus and \ncontrolled by a SPI Master, i.e. micro controller, as shown in Figure 4.1. The devices support either of two SPI \nmodes:  \n \nMode 0 (0, 0)  \nMode 3 (1, 1)  \n \nThe difference between these two modes is the  clock polarity . When the SPI master is in stand-by mode , the serial \nclock remains at “0” (SCK = 0) for Mode 0 and the clock remains at “1” (SCK = 1) for Mode 3.  Please refer to Figure \n4.2 and Figure 4 .3 for SPI and QPI mode . In both modes, the input data is latched on the rising edge of Serial Clock \n(SCK), and the output data is available from the falling edge of SCK.  \n \nFigure 4.1 Connection Diagram among SPI Master and SPI Slaves (Memory Devices)  \nSPI interface with\n(0,0) or (1,1)\nSPI Master\n(i.e. Microcontroller )\nSPI\nMemory\nDeviceSPI\nMemory\nDeviceSPI\nMemory\nDeviceSCK SO SISCKSDISDO\nCE#\nWP#SCK SO SI\nCE#\nWP#SCK SO SI\nCE#\nWP#HOLD # \nor RESET #CS3 CS2 CS1\nHOLD # \nor RESET #HOLD # \nor RESET #\n \nNotes:  \n1.

REGISTERS  \nThe device has various  sets of Registers: Status, Function, Read, Extended Read and Autoboot.  \nWhen the register is read continuously, the same data is output repeatedly until CE# goes HIGH . \n6.1 STATUS REGISTER  \nStatus Register Format and Status Regist er Bit Definitions  are described in Table  6.1 & Table 6.2. \n \nTable 6.1  Status Register Format  \n Bit 7  Bit 6  Bit 5  Bit 4  Bit 3  Bit 2  Bit 1  Bit 0  \n SRWD  QE BP3 BP2 BP1 BP0 WEL  WIP \nDefault  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n \nTable 6.2  Status Register Bit Definition  \nBit Name  Definition  Read - \n/Write  Type  \nBit 0 WIP Write In Progress Bit:  \n"0" indicates the device is ready (default)  \n"1" indicates a write cycle is in progress and the device is busy  R Volatile  \nBit 1 WEL  Write Enable Latch:  \n"0" indicates the device is not write enabled (default)  \n"1" indicates the device is write enabled  R/W1 Volatile  \nBit 2 BP0 \nBlock Protection Bit: (See Table  6.4 for details)  \n"0" indicates the specific blocks are not write -protected (default)  \n"1" indicates the specific blocks are write -protected  R/W Non-Volatile  Bit 3 BP1 \nBit 4 BP2 \nBit 5 BP3 \nBit 6 QE Quad Enable bit:  \n“0” indicates the Quad output function disable (default)  \n“1” indicates the Quad output function enable  R/W Non-Volatile  \nBit 7 SRWD  Status Register Write Disable: (See Table 7.1 for details)  \n"0" indicates the Status Register is not write -protected (default)  \n"1" indicates the Status Register is write -protected  R/W Non-Volatile  \nNote 1: WEL bit can be written by WREN and WRDI commands, but cannot by WRSR command.  \n \nThe BP0, BP1, BP2, BP3, QE, and SRWD are non-volatile memory cells that can be written by a Write Status \nRegister (WRSR) instruction. The default value of the BP0, BP1, BP2, BP3, QE, and SRWD bits were set to “ 0” at \nfactory. The Status Register can be read by the Read Status Register (RD SR). \n \nThe function of Status Register bits are described as follows:  \n \nWIP bit : Write In Progress (WIP) is read -only, and can be used to detect the progress or completion of a Program, \nErase, or Write/Set Non -Volatile/OTP Register operation. WIP is set to “ 1” (busy state) when the device is executing \nthe operation. During this time the device will ignore further instructions except for Read Status/Function/Extended \nRead Register and Software/Hardware Reset instructions. In addition to the instructions, an Er ase/Program \nSuspend instruction also can be executed during a Program or an Erase operation. When an operation has \ncompleted, WIP is cleared to “0” (ready state) whether the operation is successful or not and the device is ready \nfor further instructions.  \n \nWEL bit : Write Enable Latch (WEL) indicates the status of the internal write enable latch. When WEL is “0”, the \ninternal write enable latch is disabled and the write operations  described in Table 6.3  are inhibited. When WEL is \n“1”, the Write operations are allowed. WEL bit is set by a Write Enable (WREN) instruction. Each Write Non-Volatile  \nRegister, Program and Erase instruction must be preceded by a WREN instruction. The volatile register related \ncommands such as the Set Volatile Read R egister and the Set Volatile Extended Read Register don’t require to \nset WEL to “1". WEL can be reset by a Write Disable (WRDI) instruction. It will automatically reset after the \ncompletion of any Write operation .  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       16   \nRev.

Refer to T able 6.4 for the Block Write Protection  (BP) bit settings. When a defined \ncombination of BP3, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits are set, the corresponding memory area is protected. Any program or \nerase operation to that area will be inhibited.  \nNote:  A Chip Erase (C ER) instruction will be ignored  unless  all the Block Protection Bits are “0”s.  \n \nSRWD  bit: The Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit operates in conjunction with the Write Protection (WP#) \nsignal to provide a Hardware Protection Mode. When the SRWD is set to “0”, the Status Register is not write -\nprotected. When the SRWD is set to “1” and the WP# is pulled low (V IL), the  bits of Status Register (SRWD, QE, \nBP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) become read -only, and a WRSR instruction will be ignored. If the SRWD is set to “1” and \nWP# is pulled high (V IH), the Status Register can be changed by a WRSR instruction.  \n \nQE bit : The Quad Enable (QE) is a non -volatile bit in the Status Register that allows quad operation.

All instructions, addresses, and data are shifted in with the most significant bit (MS B) first  on \nSerial Data Input (SI) or Seri al Data IOs (IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3). The input data on SI or IOs is latched on the rising \nedge of Serial Clock (SCK) for normal mode and both of rising and falling edges for DTR mode after Chip Enable \n(CE#) is driven low (V IL). Every instruction sequence star ts with a one -byte instruction code and is followed by \naddress bytes, data bytes, or both address bytes and data bytes, depending on the type of instruction. CE# must \nbe driven high (V IH) after the last bit of the instruction sequence has been shifted in t o end the operation.  \n \nTable 8.1  Instruction Set  \nInstruction  \nName  Operation  Mode  Byte0  Byte1  Byte2  Byte3  Byte4  Byte5  Byte6  \nNORD  Normal Read  \nMode  SPI 03h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Data out      \nFRD Fast Read  \nMode  SPI \nQPI 0Bh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Data out    \nFRDIO  Fast Read  \nDual I/O  SPI BBh A \n<23:16>  \nDual A \n<15:8>  \nDual A \n<7:0>  \nDual AXh(1),(2) \nDual Dual \nData out    \nFRDO  Fast Read  \nDual Output  SPI 3Bh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Dual \nData out    \nFRQIO  Fast Read  \nQuad I/O  SPI \nQPI EBh A \n<23:16>  \nQuad  A \n<15:8>  \n Quad  A \n<7:0>  \nQuad  AXh(1), (2) \nQuad  Quad  \nData out    \nFRQO  Fast Read  \nQuad Output  SPI 6Bh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Quad  \nData out   \nFRDTR  Fast Read  \nDTR Mode  SPI \nQPI 0Dh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Dual \nData out   \nFRDDTR  Fast Read  \nDual I/O DTR  SPI BDh A \n<23:16>  \nDual A \n<15:8>  \nDual A \n<7:0>  \nDual AXh(1), (2) \nDual Dual \nData out    \nFRQDTR  Fast Read  \nQuad I/O DTR  SPI \nQPI EDh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  AXh(1), (2) \nQuad  Quad  \nData out    \nPP Input Page  \nProgram  SPI \nQPI 02h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  PD \n(256byte)     \nPPQ  Quad Input  \nPage Program  SPI  32h \n38h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Quad PD  \n(256byte)      \nSER Sector Erase  SPI \nQPI D7h \n20h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>        \nBER32 \n(32KB)  Block Erase  \n32Kbyte SPI \nQPI 52h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>        \nBER64 \n(64KB)  Block Erase  \n64Kbyte SPI \nQPI D8h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>        \nCER  Chip Erase  SPI \nQPI C7h \n60h             \nWREN  Write Enable  SPI \nQPI 06h             \nWRDI  Write Disable  SPI \nQPI 04h             \nRDSR  Read Status  \nRegister  SPI \nQPI 05h SR           \nWRSR  Write Status  \nRegister  SPI \nQPI 01h WSR  \nData            \n  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       26   \nRev.

A total of 24 address bits a re shifted in , but only AVMSB (Valid Most Significant  Bit) - A0 \nare decoded. The remaining bits (A23 – AVMSB+1) are ignored . The first byte address ed can be at any memory \nlocation. Upon completion, any data on the SI will be ignored. Refer to Table 8. 2 for the related Address Key.  \n \nThe first byte data (D7 - D0) is shifted out on the SO line, MSB first. A single byte of data, or up to the whole memory \narray, can be read out in one NORMAL READ instruction. The address is automatically incremented by one a fter \neach byte of data is shifted out. The read operation can be terminated at any time by driving CE# high (VIH) after \nthe data comes out. When the highest address of the device is reached, the address counter will roll over to the \n000000h address, allowi ng the entire memory to be read in one continuous READ instruction.  \n \nIf the NORMAL READ instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write operation is in process (WIP=1) the \ninstruction is ignored and will not have any effects on the current operation . \n \nTable 8.2  Address Key  \nValid Address  16Mb \nAVMSB–A0 A20-A0 (A23 -A21=X) \nNote: X=Don’t Care  \n \n  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       29   \nRev.

B1 2 \n09/20/2020  \n8.3 HOLD OPERATION  \nHOLD# is used in conjunction with CE# to select the device . When the device is selected and a serial sequence is  \nunderway, HOLD# can be used to pause  the serial communication with the master device without resetting the \nserial sequence. To pause, HOLD# is brought low while the SCK signal is low. To resume serial communication, \nHOLD# is brought high while the SCK signal is low (SCK may still toggle duri ng HOLD). Inputs to SI will be ignored \nwhile SO is in the high impedance state , during HOLD . \nNote:  HOLD is not supported in DTR mode  or with QE=1  or when RESET# is selected for the HOLD# or RESET# pin . \n \nTiming graph can be refere nced in AC Parameters Figur e 9.4 . \n \n8.4 FAST READ DUAL I/O  OPERATION  (FRDIO, BBh) \nThe FRDIO allows the address bits to be input two bits at a time. This may allow for code to be executed directly \nfrom the SPI in some applications.  \n \nThe FRDIO instruction code is followed by three address bytes (A23 – A0) and dummy cycles  (configurable, default \nis 4 c locks), transmitted via the IO 1 and IO0  lines, with each pair of bits latched -in during the rising edge of SCK. \nThe address MSB  is input on IO1, the next bit on IO0, and this shift pattern continues to alternat e between  the two \nlines. Depending on the usage of AX read operation mode, a mode byte may be located after address input.  \n \nThe first data byte addressed is shifted out on the IO1 and IO0 lines, with each pair of bits shifted out at a maxi mum \nfrequency f CT, during the falling edge of SCK. The MSB  is output on IO1, while simultaneously the second bit is \noutput on IO0. Figure 8.4 illustrates the timing sequence.  \n \nThe first byte addressed can be at any memory location. The address is automatically incremented  by one  after \neach byte of data is shifted out. When the highest address is reached, the address counter will roll over to the \n000000h address, allowing the entire memory to be read with a single FRDIO instruction. FRDIO instructio n is \nterminated by driving CE# high (V IH). \n \nThe device supports the AX read operation by applying mode bits  during dummy period . Mode bits consist of 8 \nbits, such as  M7 to M0.  Four cycles after address input are reserved for Mode bits in FRDIO execution . M7 to M4 \nare important for enabling this mode.  M3 to M0 become don’t care for future use.  When M[7:4]=1010(A h), it enables \nthe AX read operation and subsequent FRDIO execution skips command code. It saves cycles as described in \nFigure 8.5. When the code is  different from A Xh (where X is don’t care ), the device exits the AX read operation . \nAfter finishing the read operation, device  becomes ready to receive a new command.

As a result, 6 command cycles will be reduced by the FRQIO  instruction  in \nQPI mode . In addition, subsequent address and data out are shifted in/out via all four IO lines like the FRQIO \ninstruction. In fact, except for the  command cycle, the FRQIO operation  in QPI mode  is exactly same as the FRQIO  \noperation in SPI mode .  \n \nThe device supports the AX read operation by applying mode bits during dummy period.

The destination of the memory to be programmed must be outside the protected memory area set by \nthe Block Protection (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits. A PP instruction w hich attempts to program into a page that is \nwrite -protected will be ignored. Before the execution of PP instruction, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) must be \nenabled through a Write Enable (WREN) instruction.  \n \nThe PP instruction code, three address bytes and program data (1 to 256 bytes) are input via the Sl line. Program \noperation will start immediately after the CE# is brought high, otherwise the PP instruction will not be executed. \nThe internal control logic automa tically handles the programming voltages and timing. The progress or completion \nof the program operation can be determined by reading the WIP bit in Status Register via a RDSR instruction. If \nthe WIP bit is “1”, the program operation is still in progress. If WIP bit is “0”, the program operation has completed.  \n \nIf more than 256 bytes data are sent to a device, the address counter rolls over within the same page, the previously \nlatched data are discarded, and the last 256 bytes are kept to be programmed into  the page. The starting byte can \nbe anywhere within the page. When the end of the page is reached, the address will wrap around to the beginning \nof the same page. If the data to be programmed are less than a full page, the data of all other bytes on the sa me \npage will remain unchanged.  \nNote: A program operation can alter “1”s into “0” s.

The destination of the memory to be programmed must be outside \nthe protected memory area set by the Block Protection ( BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits. A Quad Input Page Program \ninstruction which attempts to program into a page that is write -protected will be ignored. Before the execution of \nQuad Input Page Program instruction, the QE bit in the Status Register  must be set to “1” and the Write Enable \nLatch (WEL) must be enabled through a Writ e Enable (WREN) instruction.  \n \nThe Quad Input Page Program instruction code, three address bytes and program data (1 to 256 bytes) are input \nvia the four pins (IO0, IO1, IO2 and IO3). Program operation will start immediately after the CE# is brought high, \notherwise the Quad Input Page Program instruction will not be executed. The internal control logic automatically \nhandles the programming voltages and timing. The progress or completion of the program operation can be \ndetermined by reading the WIP bit in St atus Register via a RDSR instruction. If the WIP bit is “1”, the program \noperation is still in progress. If WIP bit is “0”, the program operation has completed.  \n \nIf more than 256 bytes data are sent to a device, the address counter rolls over within the sa me page, the previously \nlatched data are discarded, and the last 256 bytes data are kept to be programmed into the page. The starting byte \ncan be anywhere within the page. When the end of the page is reached, the address will wrap around to the \nbeginning o f the same page. If the data to be programmed are less than a full page, the data of all other bytes on \nthe same page will remain unchanged.  \nNote: A program operation can alter “1”s into “0” s. The same byte location or page may be programmed more than \nonce , to incrementally change “1”s to “0”s. An erase operation is required to change “0 ”s to “1 ”s. \n \nFigure 8.13  Quad Input Page Program Sequence  \n \nInstruction = 32h/38h 23CE#\nSCK\n4 0 4 03-byte Address\nHigh Impedance22 ... 00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 31 32 33 34 35Mode 3\nMode 0\nIO0\nIO1 5 1 5 1\n6 2 6 2\n7 3 7 3Data In 2\nIO2\nIO3...\nData In 1\n......\n...\n......\n \n  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       45   \nRev.

A sector erase oper ation allows any individual sector to be erased without affecting the \ndata in other sectors. A block erase operation erases any individual block. A chip erase operation erases the whole \nmemory arr ay of a device. A sector erase, block erase , or chip erase o peration can be executed prior to any \nprogramming operation.  \n \n  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       46   \nRev.

But Suspend command \nwill be ignored during Chip Erase operation. After the Suspend  command , other commands include array read \noperation can be accepted.  \n \nBut Write Status Register command (01h) and Erase instructions are not allowed during Erase Suspend. Also, \narray read for being erased sector/block is not allowed.  \n \nTo execute Erase Suspend operation, the host drives CE# low, sends the Suspend command cycle (75h/B0h), \nthen drives CE# high. The Function Register indicates that the Erase has been suspended by setting  the ESUS bit \nfrom “0” to “1”, but the device will not accept another command u ntil it is ready. To determine when the device will \naccept a new command, poll the WIP bit or wait the specified time t SUS.

During this mode,  standby current is reduced from I sb1 to I sb2. While in  the Power -down \nmode, the device is not active and all Write/Program/Erase instructions are ignored. The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the CE# pin low and shifting the instruction code into the device . The CE# pin must be driven high after the \ninstru ction has been latched , or Power -down mode will not engage . Once  CE# pin driven high, the Power -down \nmode  will be entered within the time duration of t DP. While in the Power -down mode  only the Release from Power -\ndown/RDID instruction, which restores the de vice to normal operation, will be recognized.

B1 2 \n09/20/2020  \nRead with “8/16/32 /64-Byte Wrap Around”  \nThe device is capable of burst read with wrap around in both SPI and QPI mode. The size of burst length is \nconfigurable by using P0, P1, and P2 bits in Read Register . P2 bit  (Wrap enable) enables the burst  mode feature. \nP0 and P1 define  the size of burst. Burst lengths of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bytes are supported. By default, address \nincreases by one up through the entire  array. By setting the burst length, the data being accessed can be limited \nto the length o f burst boundary within a  256 byte page. The first output will be the data at the initial address which \nis specified in the instruction. Following data will come out  from the next address within the  burst boundary. Once \nthe address reaches the end of bound ary, it will automatically move  to the first address of the boundary. CE# high \nwill terminate the command.  \n \nFor example, if burst length of 8 and initial address being applied is 0h, following byte output will be from address \n00h and continue to 01h,..,07h , 00h, 01h… until CE# terminate s the operation. If burst length of 8 and initial address \nbeing applied is FEh(254 d), following byte output will be from address FEh and continue to FFh, F8h, F9h,  FAh,  \nFBh,  FCh,  FDh, and repeat from FEh  until CE# terminate s the operation.  \n \nThe command s, “SRPV (65h) or SRPNV (C0h or 63h) ”, are used to configure the burst length. If the following data \ninput is one of “00h”,”01h”,”02h”, and ”03h”, the device will be in default operation mode. It will be continuous burst \nread of  the whole array. If the following data input is one of “04h”,”05h”,”06h”, and ”07h”, the device will set the \nburst length as 8,16,32 and 64 , respectively.  \n \nTo exit the burst mode , another “C0 h or 63h ” command  is necessary to set P2 to 0. Otherwise, the burst mode  will \nbe retained until either power down or reset operation. To change burst length , another “C0 h or 63h ” command \nshould be executed to set P0 and P1 (Detailed information in Table 6. 9 Burst Length Data). All read commands \nwill operate in  burst  mode  once  the Read Register  is set to enable burst  mode . \n \nRefer to Figure  8.40 and Figure 8.41 for instruction sequence.  \n \n  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       63   \nRev.

B1 2 \n09/20/2020  \n8.34 SOFTWARE  RESET  (RESET -ENABLE  (RSTEN , 66h) AND RESET  (RST , 99h)) AND HARDWARE RESET  \nThe Software Reset operation is used as a system reset that puts the device in normal operating mode. During the \nReset operation, the value of volatile registers will default back to the value in the corresponding non -volatile \nregister. Software Reset is the s ame as Hardware Reset. This operation consists of two commands: Reset -Enable \n(RSTEN) and Reset (RST). The operation requires the Reset -Enable command followed by the Reset command. \nAny command other than the Reset command after the Reset -Enable command wil l disable the Reset -Enable.  \n \nExecute the CE# pin low  \uf0e0 sends the Reset -Enable command (66 h), and drives CE# high. Next, the host drives \nCE# low again, sends the Reset command (99 h), and pulls C E# high.  \n \nOnly if the RESET# pin is enabled, Hardware Reset function is available.  \nFor the device with HOLD#/RESET#,  the RESET# pin will be solely applicable in SPI mode and when the QE bit = \n“0”. For the device with dedicated RESET# (Dedicated RESET# Disable bit i s “0” in Function Register), the RESET# \npin is always applicable regardless of the QE bit value in Status Register and HOLD#/RESET# selection bit (P7) in \nRead Register in SPI/QPI mode.  \n \nIn order to activate Hardware Reset, the RESET# pin (or ball) must be driven low for a minimum period of t RESET  \n(100ns). Drive RESET# low for a minimum period of t RESET  will interrupt any on -going internal and external \noperations , release the device from d eep power down mode1, disable all input signals, force the output pin enter a \nstate of high impedance, and reset all the read parameters.   \nThe required wait time after activating a HW Reset before the device w ill accept another instruction  is t HWRST  of \n35us. \n \nThe Software/Hardware Reset during an active Program or Erase operation aborts the operation, which can result \nin corrupting or losing the data of the targeted address range. Depending on the prior operation, the reset timing \nmay vary. Recovery from a Write operation will require more latency than recovery from other operations . \nNote1: The Status and Function Registers remain unaffected.  \n \nFigure 8.58  Software  Reset  Enable and Software R eset Sequence  In SPI Mode  (RSTEN, 66h + RST, 99h ) \n \nInstruction = 66hCE#\nSCK\nSI0 1Mode 3\nMode 02 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction = 99h8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\nSOHigh Impedance\n \n  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       74   \nRev.

Before the execution of IRP instruction, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) must be enabled through \na Write Enable (WREN) instruction.  \n \nThe IRP instruction code, three address bytes and program data (1 to 256 bytes) should be  sequentially input . \nThree address bytes has to be input as specified in the Table 8. 7 Information Row Valid Address Range . Program \noperation will sta rt once  the CE# goes  high, otherwise the IRP instruction will not be executed. The internal control \nlogic automatically handle s the programming voltages and timing. The progress or completion of the program \noperation can be determined by reading the WIP bit in Status Register via a RDSR instruction. If the WIP bit is “1”, \nthe program operation is still in progress. If WIP bit is “0”, the program operation has completed.  \n \nIf more than 256 bytes data are sent to a device, the address counter rolls over within the same page . The \npreviously latched data are discarded and the last 256 bytes data are kept to be programmed into the page. The \nstarting byte can be anywhere within the page. When the end of the page is reached, the address will wrap around \nto the beginning of the same page. If the data to be programmed are less than a full p age, the data of all other \nbytes on the same page will remain unchanged.  \nNote:  A program operation can alter “1”s into “0”s, The same byte location or  Information Row  array  may be \nprogrammed more than once to incrementally change “1” to “0”s. A n erase oper ation is required to change “0”s \nback to “1”s.  \n \nFigure 8.61  IRP (Information Row Program ) Sequence  \n \nInstruction = 62h 23CE#\nSCK\nSI7 6\nSO73-byte Address\nHigh Impedance22...0Data In 1 Data In 2560 1 ... 7 8 9 ... 31 32 33 ... 39 ...\n2072\n...\n2079\nMode 3\nMode 0\n...0... ...0\n \n \n  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       77   \nRev. B1 2 \n09/20/2020  \n8.38 INFORMATION ROW READ  OPERATION  (IRRD,  68h) \nThe IRRD  instruction is used to read memory data at up to a 1 33MHz clock.  \n \nThe IRRD  instruction code is followed by three address bytes (A23 - A0) and dummy cycles (configurable, default \nis 8 clocks) , transmitted via the SI line, with each bit latched -in during the rising edge of SCK. Then the first data \nbyte addressed is shifted out on the SO line, with each bit shifted out at a maximum frequency f CT, during the falling \nedge of SCK.  \n \nThe address is a utomatically incremented by one after each byte of data is shifted out. Once the address reaches \nthe last address of each 256 byte Information Row, the next address will not be valid and the data of the address \nwill be garbage data. It is recommended to re peat four times IRRD operation that reads 256 byte with a valid starting \naddress of each Information Row in order to read all data in the 4 x 256 byte Information Row array. The IRRD  \ninstruction is terminated by driving CE# high (VIH).   \n \nIf an IRRD  instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (WIP=1) the instruction is \nignored and will not have any effects on the current cycle . \n \nThe sequence of IRRD instruction is same as FAST READ except for the instruction code. IRRD QPI sequence is \nalso same as FAST READ QPI except for the instruction code.

The address is latched on both rising and falling edge of SCK, and data of each bit shifts out on both rising \nand falling edge of SCK at a maximu m frequency .

In addition, subsequent address and data out are shifted in/out via all four IO lines unlike \nthe FRDTR instruction.

As a result, 6 command c ycles will be reduced by the FRQDTR QPI instruction. In \naddition, subsequent address and data out are shifted in/out via all four IO lines like the FRQDTR instruction. In \nfact, except for the command cycle, the FRQDTR operation  in QPI mode  is exactly same as the FRQDTR  operation \nin SPI mode .  \n \nIt is not required to set QE bit to “1” .before Fast Read Quad I/O DTR instruction  in QPI mode.  \n \nThe sequence of issuing FRQDTR  instruction  in QPI mode  is: CE# goes low \uf0e0 Sending FR QDTR  instruction (4 -\nbit per clock) \uf0e0 24-bit address interleave on IO3, IO2, IO1 & IO0 (8-bit per clock) \uf0e0 6 dummy clocks (configurable , \ndefault is 6 clocks ) \uf0e0 Data out interleave on IO3, IO2, IO1 & IO0 (8-bit per clock) \uf0e0 End FRQDTR operation by \ndriving CE# high at any time during data out.  \n \nIf AXh ( where X is don’t care ) is input for the mode bits during dummy cycles, the device will enter AX read operation \nmode which enables subsequent FR QDTR execution skips command code. It saves cycles as described in Figure \n8.68. When the code is different from AXh, the device exits the AX read operation. After finishing the read operation, \ndevice becomes ready to receive a new command.  \n \nIf the FRQDTR instruction  in QPI mode  is issued while a Program/Erase/Write Status Register cycle is in progress \n(WIP=1), the instruction will be rejected without any effect on the current cycle.  \n \nFigure 8.69  FRQDTR  Sequence  In QPI Mode  (with command decode cycles)  \n \nInstruction\n= EDhCE#\nSCK\n3-byte Address0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12Mode 3\nMode 0\ntV\n201612\n51 21171340IO0\nIO1\n221814\n231915840\n951\n1062\n11736 Dummy Cycles\nIO2\nIO362\n735140\n62\n73Data\nOutData\nOut\n5140\n62\n73\nMode Bits...\n4 0\n5 1\n6 2\n7 3......\n...\n...\n \n \nNotes:  \n1.

B1 2 \n09/20/2020  \n8.43 AUTOBOOT  \nSPI devices normally require 32 or more cycles of command and address shifting to initiate a read command. And, \nin order to read boot code from an SPI device, the host memory controller or processor must supply the read \ncommand from a hardwired state machine or from some host processor internal ROM code.  \nParallel NOR devices need only an initial addres s, supplied in parallel in a single cycle, and initial access time to \nstart reading boot code.  \nThe AutoBoot feature allows the host memory controller to take boot code from the device immediately after the \nend of reset, without having to send a read comman d. This saves 32 or more cycles and simplifies the logic needed \nto initiate the reading of boot code.  \n \n\uf0b7 As part of the Power -up Reset, Hardware Reset, or Software Reset process the AutoBoot feature automatically \nstarts a read access from a pre -specified add ress. At the time the reset process is completed, the device is \nready to deliver code from the starting address. The host memory controller only needs to drive CE# signal from \nhigh to low and begin toggling the SCK signal. The device will delay code output  for a pre -specified number of \nclock cycles before code streams out.  \n \n– The Auto Boot Start Delay (ABSD) field of the AutoBoot register specifies the initial delay if any is needed by \nthe host.  \n– The host cannot send commands during this time.  \n– If QE bit (Bit 6) in the Status Register is set to “1”, Fast Read Quad I/O operation will be selected and initial \ndelay is the same as dummy cycles of Fast Read Quad I/O Read operation. If it is set to “0”, Fast Read \noperation will be applied and initial delay is th e same as dummy cycles of Fast Read operation. Maximum  \noperation frequency will be 133 MHz for both operations.  \n \n\uf0b7 The starting address of the boot code is selected by the value programmed into the AutoBoot Start Address \n(ABSA) field of the AutoBoot Register.  \n \n– Data will continuously shift out until CE# returns high.  \n \n\uf0b7 At any point after the first data byte is transferred, when CE# returns high, the SPI device will reset to standard \nSPI mode; able to accept normal command operations.  \n \n– A minimum of one byte must be transferred.  \n– AutoBoot mode will not initiate again until another power cycle or a reset occurs.  \n \n\uf0b7 An AutoBoot Enable bit (ABE) is set to enable the AutoBoot feature.  \n \nThe AutoBoot register bits are non -volatile and provide:  \n\uf0b7 The starting address se t by the AutoBoot Start Address (ABSA).  \n\uf0b7 The number of initial delay cycles, set by the AutoBoot Start Delay (ABSD) 4 -bit count value.  \n \n  \n  \n                                                                                                         IS25LP016 D \n                                                                                                         IS25WP016 D \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       90   \nRev.
