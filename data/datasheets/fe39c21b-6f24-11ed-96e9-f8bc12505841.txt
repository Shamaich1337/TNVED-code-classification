Outputs are stable with capacitive loads of over \n1000 pF. Supply current is less than 3 mA per amplifier at 30 V . \nThe AD8671/AD8672/AD8674’s combination of ultralow noise, \nhigh precision, speed, and stability is unmatched. The MSOP \nversion of the AD8671/AD8672 requires only half the board \nspace of comparable amplifiers. \nApplications for these amplifiers include high quality PLL \nfilters, precision filters, medical and analytical instrumentation, \nprecision power supply controls, ATE, data acquisition, and \nprecision controls as well as professional quality audio. \nThe AD8671/AD8672 are specified over the extended industrial \ntemperature range (−40°C to +125°C), and the AD8674 is specified \nover the industrial temperature range (−40°C to +85°C).  \nThe AD8671/AD8672 are available in the 8-lead SOIC and \n8-lead MSOP packages. The AD8674 is available in 14-lead \nSOIC and 14-lead TSSOP packages. \nSurface-mount devices in MSOP packages are available in tape \nand reel only.

F  | Page 11 of 20 APPLICATIONS \nPOWER DISSIPATION CA LCULATIONS  \nTo achieve low voltage noise in a bipolar op amp, the current \nmust be increased. The emitter -base theoretical voltage noise is \napproximately  \nHz nV/2109\nCnqIkT e=  \nTo achieve the low voltage noise of 2.8 nV/ √Hz, the input stage \ncurrent is higher than most op amps with an equivalent gain \nbandwidth product. The thermal noise of a 1  kΩ resistor is \n4 nV/√Hz, which is higher than the voltage noise of AD8671 \nfamily. Low voltage noise requires using low values of re sistors, \nso low voltage noise op amps should have good drive capability, such as a 600 Ω load. This means that the second stage and \noutput stage are  also biased at higher currents. As a result, the \nsupply current of a single op amp is 3.5 mA maximum at roo m \ntemperature.  \nJunction temperature has a direct affect on reliability. For more  \ninformation, visit the following Analog Devices, Inc., website: \nhttp://www.analog.com/en/quality -and-reliability/reliability -\ndata/content/index.html   \nMTTF and FIT calculations can be done based on the junction temperature and IC process. Use the following equation to  \ndetermine the junction temperature:  \nT\nJ = TA + PD × θJA \nFor the AD8671 single  in the 8 -lead MSOP package, the thermal  \nresistance, θ JA, is 142 °C/W . If the ambient temperature is 30 °C \nand the supply voltages are ±12  V , the power dissipation is  \n24 V × 3.5 mA = 84 mW  \nTherefore, the rise above ambient temperatu re is \n84 mW ×  142° C/W  = 12° C  \nIf the ambient temperature is 30° C, the junction temperature is \n42°C. The previously mentioned website that details  the effect \nof the junction temperature on reliability has a calculator that requires only the part number and the junction temperature  to \ndetermine the process  technology . \nFor the AD8674 singl e in the 14 -Lead TSSOP package, the thermal  \nresistance, θ\nJA, is 112 °C/W . Although θ JA is lower than it is for the  \n8-lead package, the four op amps are powered simultaneously. If  \nthe ambient temperature is 50 °C and the supply voltages are ±15  V, \nthe power dissipation is  \n30 V × 4.2 mA × four op amps = 504 mW  Therefore, the rise above ambient temperature is  \n504 mW ×  112° C/W = 56 °C \nWith an ambient temperature of 50 °C, the junction temperature \nis 106 °C. This is less than the specified absolute maximum junction  \ntemperature, but for systems with long prod uct lifetimes (years), \nthis should be considered  carefully .  \nNote that these calculations do not include the additional \ndissipation caused by the load current on each op amp. Possible \nsolutions to reduce junction temperature include system level considerat ions such as fans, Peltier thermoelectric coolers, and \nheat pipes. Board considerations include operation on lower voltages, such as ±12  V or ±5  V , and using two dual op amps \ninstead of one quad op amp. If the extremely low voltage noise and high gain band width is not required, using other quad op \namps, such as ADA4091- 4, OP4177, ADA4004- 4, OP497, or \nAD704 can be considered.  \nUNITY- GAIN FOLLOWER APPLICATION S \nWhen large transient pulses (>1 V) are applied at the positive \nterminal of amplif iers (such as the OP27, LT1007, OPA227, and \nAD8671)  with back -to-back diodes at the input stage, the use of \na resistor in the feedback loop is recommended to avoid ha ving \nthe amplifier load the signal generator. The feedback resi stor, \nRF, should be at least 500 Ω. However, if large values must be \nused for R F, a small capacitor, C F, should be inserted in pa rallel \nwith R F to compensate for the pole introduced by the input \ncapacitance and R F. \nFigure 30 shows the unc ompensated output response with a \n10 kΩ resistor in the feedback and the compensated response \nwith C F = 15 pF.  \n03718-B-032REF1 +OVER\n23.23%\nCH2 +OVER\n7.885%VOLTAGE (1V/DIV)OUTPUT UNCOMPENSATED\nOUTPUT\nCOMPENSATED\nTIME (100ns/DIV) \nFigure 30.

However, because they have low input current noise, they can also be used in circuits with substantial source resistance.  \nFigure 32 shows the voltage noise, current noise, thermal noise, \nand total rms noise of the AD8671 as a function of the source \nresistance.  \nFor R\nS < 475 Ω, the input voltage noise, e n, dominates. \nFor 475 Ω < R S < 412 kΩ, thermal noise dominates. \nFor R S > 412 kΩ, the input current noise dominates.  \n10 1k TOTAL NOISE (nV/ \uf0d6Hz)\n1101001000\n100 10k\n03718-B-034100k 1Men_tC\nA Benin\n(4kRST)1/2\nSOURCE RESISTANCE ( \uf057) \nFigure 32.

Total Harmonic Distortion and Noise  \n \nDRIVING CAPACITIVE L OADS  \nThe AD8671/AD8672/AD8674 can drive large capacitive loads \nwithout causing instability. However, when configur ed in unity \ngain, driving very large loads can cause unwanted ringing or \ninstabi lity.  \nFigure 34 shows the output of the AD8671 with a capacitive \nload of 1 nF. If heavier loads are used in low closed -loop gain or \nunity -gain config urations, it is recommended to use external \ncompensation as shown in the circuit in Figure 35. This \ntechnique reduces the overshoot and prevents the op amp from oscillation. The trade -off of this circuit is a reduction in ou tput \nswing. However, a great added benefit stems from the fact that the input signal and  the op amp’s noise are fi ltered, and thus the \noverall output noise is kept to a min imum.  \nThe output response of the circuit is shown in Figure 36.  \n03718-B-036VSY =±15V\nRL = 2kΩ\nCL = 1nF\nVIN = 100mV\nAV = +1\nCH2 +OVER\n39.80%\nCH2 –OVER\n39.80%\nTIME (10 µs/DIV)VOLTAGE (500mV/DIV)\n \nFigure 34.

The \nprecision of the AD8671 makes it an excellent choice for such applications. Its very low noise and wide bandwidth make it suitable for band -pass and low -pass filters without the penalty \nof high power consumption.  \nFigure 37 shows a simplified block diagram of a GPS r eceiver. \nThe next section details the design equations.  \nBAND -PASS FILTER  \nFilters are useful in many app lications ; for example, band -pass \nfilters are used in GPS systems, as discussed in the previous \nsection.

Band -Pass Response  \nPLL SYNTHESIZERS AND  LOOP FILTERS  \nPhase -lock loop filters are used in AM/FM modulation.  \nLoop filters in PLL design require accuracy and care in their \nimplementation. The AD8671/AD8672/AD8674 are ideal \ncandidates for such filter design; the low offset vol tage and low \ninput bias current minimize the output error. In addition to the excellent dc spec ifications, the AD8671/AD8672/AD8674 have \na unique performance at high fr equencies; the high open -loop \ngain and wide ban dwidth allow the user to design a filter with a \nhigh closed -loop gain if desi rable. To optimize the filter design, \nit is recommended to use small value resistors to minimize the \nthermal noise.
