(In order to satisfy the supplying stability, management \noptimization and the best product performance...etc, under the premise of not affecting the \nelectrical character istics and external dimensions,  Raystar  have the right to modify the \nversion.)  \n(10) Raystar  has the right to upgrade or modify the product function . \n \n11.1. Handling Precautions  \n(1) Since the display panel is being made of glass, do not apply mechanical impacts such as \ndropping from a high position.  \n(2) If the display panel is broken by some accident and the internal organic substance leaks out, \nbe careful not to inhale nor lick the organic substance.  \n(3) If pressure is applied to the display surface or its neighborhood of the OLED display module, \nthe cell struct ure may be damaged . So, be careful not to apply pressure to these sections.  \n(4) The polarizer covering the surface of the OLED display module is soft and easily scratched.  \n(5) When the surface of the polarizer of the OLED display module has soil, clean the surfac e. It \ntakes advantage  by using following adhesion tape.  \n* Scotch Mending Tape No. 810 or an equivalent  \nNever try to breathe upon the soiled surface nor wipe the surface using cloth containing \nsolvent  such as ethyl alcohol, since the surface of the polarize r will become cloudy.  \nAlso, pay attention that the following liquid and solvent may spoil the polarizer:  \n* Water  \n* Ketone  \n* Aromatic Solvents  \n(6) Protection film is being applied to the surface of the display panel and removes the \nprotection film before assemb ling it. At this time, if the OLED display module has been \nstored for a long period of time, residue adhesive material of the protection film may remain \non the  surface of the display panel after removed of the film. In such case, remove the \nresidue  materia l by the method introduced in the above Section 5.  \n(7) Do not touch the following sections whenever possible while handling the OLED display \nmodules.  \n* Pins and electrodes  \n* Pattern layouts such as the TCP & FPC  \n(8) Hold OLED display module very carefully when pla cing OLED display module into the  \n \n    \n \n \nPage 24 , Total 27 Pages  System housing. Do not apply excessive stress or pressure to OLED display module. And, \ndo not over bend the film with electrode pattern layouts.  These stresses will influence the \ndisplay performance. Also, secure sufficien t rigidity for the  outer cases.  \n \n(9) Do not apply stress to the LSI chips and the surrounding molded sections.  \n(10) Pay sufficient attention to the working environments when handing OLED display  modules \nto prevent occurrence of element breakage accidents by static  electricity.  \n* Be sure to make human body grounding when handling OLED display modules.  \n* Be sure to ground tools to use or assembly such as soldering irons.  \n* To suppress generation of static electricity, avoid carrying out assembly work under dry \nenvironments.  \n* Protective film is being applied to the surface of the display panel of the OLED display  \nmodule. Be careful since static electricity may be generated when exfoliating the protective  \nfilm. \n \n11.2. Storage Precautions  \n(1) When storing OLED display  modules, put them in static electricity preventive bags  to avoid  \nbe directly exposed to sun or lights of fluorescent lamps. (We recommend you to store these \nmodules in the packaged state when they were shipped  from Raystar . At that time, be \ncareful not to  let water drops adhere to the packages or bags. ) \n \n(2) When the OLED display module is being dewed or when it is placed under  high temperature \nor high humidity environments, the electrodes may be corroded if electric current is applied . \nPlease stor e it in clea n environment.  \n \n11.3. Designing Precautions  \n(1) The absolute maximum ratings are the ratings which cannot be exceeded for OLED  display \nmodule, and if these values are exceeded, OLED  display module may be damage d. \n(2) To prevent occurrence of malfunctioning by noise, pay attention to satisfy the VIL and VIH  \nspecification and to make the signal line cable as short as possible.  \n(3) We recommend you to install excess current preventive unit (fuses, etc.) to the power  circuit \n(VDD  / VCC ). (Recommend value: 0.5A)  \n(4) Pay suf ficient attention to avoid occurrence of mutual noise interference with the  nearby \ndevices.  \n(5) As for EMI, take necessary measures on the equipment side basically.  \n(6) If the power suppl ied to the OLED display module is forcibly shut down by such errors as \ntaking  out the main battery while the OLED display panel is in operation, we cannot \nguarantee the  quality of this OLED display module.  \n* Connection (contact) to any other potential than the above may lead to rupture of the IC.  \n\n \n    \n \n \nPage 25 , Total 27 Pages  (7) If this OLED driver is exposed to l ight, malfunctioning may occur  and s emiconductor \nelements may change their characteristics.  \n(8) The internal status may be changed, if excessive external noise  enters into the module.   \nTherefore , it is necessary to take appropriate measures to suppress noise generation or to \nprotect module from influences of noise on the system design.  \n(9) We recommend you to make periodical refreshment of the operation statuses (re -setting of \nthe commands and re -transference of the display data) to cope with catastrophic noise.  \n(10) It\'s pretty common to use "Screen Saver" to extend the lifetime and Don\'t use the same  \nimage for long time in real application. When an OLED display module is operated for a long \nof time with fixed pattern , an afterimage or slight contrast deviation may oc cur. \n(11) The module should be fixed balanc ed into the housing, or the module may be twisted.  \n \n \n11.4. Precautions when disposing of the OLED display modules  \n(1) Request the qualified companies to handle industrial wastes when disposing of the OLED \ndisplay modules.  Or, when burning them, be sure to observe the environmental and hygienic \nlaws and regulations.  \n0.1(0.1 Max.)\n \n    \n \n \nPage 26 , Total 27 Pages  Page: 1  \nModule Sample Estimate Feedback Sheet  \nModule Number ：                                              \n \n1、Panel Specification ： \n  1.
