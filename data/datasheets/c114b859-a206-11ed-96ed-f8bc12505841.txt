All the 32 \nregisters are directly connected to the Arithmetic Logic  Unit (ALU), allowing two independent registers to be \naccessed in one single instruction executed in one clock cycle. The resulting architecture is more code efficient \nwhile achieving throughputs up to ten times fast er than conventional CISC microcontrollers.\nThe ATmega16A provides the following features: 16 Kbytes of In-System Programmable Flash Program \nmemory with Read-While-Wri te capabilities; 512bytes EE PROM; 1Kbyte SRAM; 32 ge neral purpos e I/O lines, \n32 general purpose working registers; a JTAG interf ace for Boundary-scan; On-chip Debugging support and \nprogramming; three flexible Timer/Counters with compar e modes; Internal and Exter nal Interrupts; a serial \nprogrammable USART; a byte oriented Two-wire Serial  Interface, an 8-channel; 10-bit ADC with optional \ndifferential input stage with programmable gain (TQFP package only); a programmable Watchdog Timer with \nInternal Oscillator; an SPI serial port;  and six software selectable power sa ving modes. The Idle mode stops the \nCPU while allowing the USART; Two- wire interface; A/D Converter; SRAM; Timer/Counters; SPI port; and \ninterrupt system to continue functioning. The Power- down mode saves the register contents but freezes the \nOscillator, disabling all othe r chip functions until the next External Inte rrupt or Hardwa re Reset. In  Power-save \nmode, the Asynchronous Timer continues to run, allowing the user to maintain a timer base while the rest of the device is sleeping. The ADC Noise Reduction mode st ops the CPU and all I/O modules except Asynchronous \nTimer and ADC, to minimize switching noise during ADC conversions. In Standby mode, the crystal/resonator \nOscillator is running while the rest of  the device is sleeping. This allows very fast start-up combined with low-\npower consumption. In Exte nded Standby mode, both the main Oscillator and the A synchronous Timer continue \nto run. \nThe device is manufactured using Atmels high densit y nonvolatile memory technol ogy. The On-chip ISP Flash \nallows the program memory to be reprogrammed in-system through an SPI serial interface, by a conventional \nnonvolatile memory programmer, or by an On-chip Boot  program running on the AVR core. The boot program \ncan use any interface to download the application program  in the Application Flash memory. Software in the \nBoot Flash section will continue to ru n while the Application Flash sectio n is updated, providing true Read-\nWhile-Write operation. By combining an 8-bit RISC  CPU with In-System Self-Programmable Flash on a \nmonolithic chip, the Atmel ATmega16A is a powerful micr ocontroller that provides a highly-flexible and cost-\neffective solution to many embedded control applications.\nThe ATmega16A is supported with a full suite of program and system development tools including: C compilers, \nmacro assemblers, program debugger/simulators, in-circuit emulators, and evaluation kits.\n6 ATmega16A [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-8154CS-8-bit-AVR-ATmega16A_Datasheet Summary-07/20142.2 Pin Descriptions\n2.2.1 VCC\nDigital supply voltage.\n2.2.2 GND\nGround.\n2.2.3 Port A (PA7:PA0)\nPort A serves as the analog inputs to the A/D Converter.\nPort A also serves as an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port, if the A/D Converter is not used. Port pins can provide \ninternal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit). The Port  A output buffers have symmet rical drive characteristics \nwith both high sink and source capability. When pins  PA0 to PA7 are used as inpu ts and are externally pulled \nlow, they will source current if the in ternal pull-up resistors are activated. Th e Port A pins are tri-stated when a \nreset condition becomes active, ev en if the clock is not running.\n2.2.4 Port B (PB7:PB0)\nPort B is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pu ll-up resistors (selected for each bit). The Port B output \nbuffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source capability. As inputs, Port B pins \nthat are externally pulled low will source  current if the pull-up resistors are activated. The Port B pins are tri-\nstated when a reset condition becomes active, even if the clock is not running.\nPort B also serves the functions of various special features of the ATmega16A as listed on  page 57 .\n2.2.5 Port C (PC7:PC0)\nPort C is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pu ll-up resistors (selected for ea ch bit). The Port C output \nbuffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source capability. As inputs, Port C pins \nthat are externally pulled low will source  current if the pull-up resistors are activated. The Port C pins are tri-\nstated when a reset condition becomes active, even if the clock is not running. If the JTAG interface is enabled, \nthe pull-up resistors on pins PC5(TDI), PC3(TMS) and PC 2(TCK) will be activated even if a reset occurs.\nPort C also serves the functions of the JTAG interface an d other special features of the ATmega16A as listed on  \npage 59 .\n2.2.6 Port D (PD7:PD0)\nPort D is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pu ll-up resistors (selected for ea ch bit). The Port D output \nbuffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source capability. As inputs, Port D pins \nthat are externally pulled low will source  current if the pull-up resistors are activated. The Port D pins are tri-\nstated when a reset condition becomes active, even if the clock is not running.\nPort D also serves the functions of various special features of the ATmega16A as listed on  page 62 . \n2.2.7 RESET\nReset Input. A low level on this pin for longer than the mini mum pulse length will generate a reset,  even if the \nclock is not running. The minimum pulse length is given in Table 27-2 on page 281 . Shorter pulses are not \nguaranteed to generate a reset.\n2.2.8 XTAL1\nInput to the inverting Oscillato r amplifier and input to the in ternal clock operating circuit.\n7 ATmega16A [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-8154CS-8-bit-AVR-ATmega16A_Datasheet Summary-07/20142.2.9 XTAL2\nOutput from th e inverting Osc illator amplifier.\n2.2.10 AVCC\nAVCC is the supply voltage pin for Port A and the A/D Converter. It should be externally connected to VCC, even \nif the ADC is not used. If the ADC is used, it should be connected to VCC through a low-pass filter. \n2.2.11 AREF\nAREF is the analog reference pin for the A/D Converter.\n3. Resources\nA comprehensive set of development tools, applicatio n notes and datasheets are available for download on \nhttp://www.atmel.com/avr.\nNote: 1. Data retention\n4. Data Retention\nReliability Qualification results show that  the projected data retention failure rate is much less  than 1 PPM over \n20 years at 85°C or 100 years at 25°C.\n5. About Code Examples \nThis documentation contains simple code examples that  briefly show how to use various parts of the device. \nThese code examples assume that the part specific header file is included before compilation. Be aware that not \nall C Compiler vendors include bit definitions in the header files and interrupt handling in C is compiler \ndependent.

Issue the BYPASS instruction to the\nATmega16A while reading the Device ID Registers of preceding devices of the boundary scan chain.\n– If the Device IDs of all devices in the boundar y scan chain must be captur ed simultaneously, the\nATmega16A must be the fist device in the chain.\n4.
