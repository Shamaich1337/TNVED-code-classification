Recovery from \na thermal shutdown is automatic once the device has cooled sufficiently. Internal circuitry ensures that the switch \nremains off until valid input voltage is present. This power-distribution switch is designed to set current limit at \n1.5 A typically.\nwww.ti.comTPS2061, TPS2062, TPS2063\nTPS2065, TPS2066, TPS2067\nSLVS490J – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED AUGUST 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2061  TPS2062  TPS2063  TPS2065  TPS2066  TPS2067\n6 Pin Configuration and Functions\nTPS2062/TPS2066\nD AND□DGN□PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\n†All□Enable□Inputs Are Active□High□For□TPS2065,□TPS2066,□and□TPS20671 GNDTPS2063/TPS2067\nD□PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)TPS2061/TPS2065\nD AND□DGN□PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW )\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9IN1\nGND\nIN2\nNCOC1\nOUT1\nOUT2\nOUT3\nNC\nNCGND\nIN\nINOUT\nOUT\nOUTGND\nINOC1\nOUT1\nOUT2\nOC2\nOC3OC2 OC1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n51\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5\nEN3†EN†\nEN1†EN1†\nEN2†EN2†\nGNDOUTTPS2061/TPS2065\nDBV□PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\nIN\nOC EN†\nTable 6-1.

TPS2063 and TPS2067\n9.2 Power Switch\nThe power switch is an N-channel MOSFET with a low on-state resistance. Configured as a high-side switch, the \npower switch prevents current flow from OUT to IN and IN to OUT when disabled. The power switch supplies a \nminimum current of 1 A.\n9.3 Charge Pump\nAn internal charge pump supplies power to the driver circuit and provides the necessary voltage to pull the gate \nof the MOSFET above the source. The charge pump operates from input voltages as low as 2.7 V and requires \nlittle supply current.\n9.4 Driver\nThe driver controls the gate voltage of the power switch. To limit large current surges and reduce the associated \nelectromagnetic interference (EMI) produced, the driver incorporates circuitry that controls the rise times and fall \ntimes of the output voltage.\n9.5 Enable ( ENx or ENx)\nThe logic enable disables the power switch and the bias for the charge pump, driver, and other circuitry to \nreduce the supply current. The supply current is reduced to less than 1 μA when a logic high is present on ENx, \nwww.ti.comTPS2061, TPS2062, TPS2063\nTPS2065, TPS2066, TPS2067\nSLVS490J – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED AUGUST 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2061  TPS2062  TPS2063  TPS2065  TPS2066  TPS2067\nor when a logic low is present on ENx. A logic zero input on ENx, or a logic high input on ENx restores bias to \nthe drive and control circuits and turns the switch on. The enable input is compatible with both TTL and CMOS \nlogic levels.\n9.6 Current Sense\nA sense FET monitors the current supplied to the load. The sense FET measures current more efficiently than \nconventional resistance methods. When an overload or short circuit is encountered, the current-sense circuitry \nsends a control signal to the driver. The driver in turn reduces the gate voltage and drives the power FET into its \nsaturation region, which switches the output into a constant-current mode and holds the current constant while \nvarying the voltage on the load.\n9.7 Overcurrent\nA sense FET is employed to check for overcurrent conditions. Unlike current-sense resistors, sense FETs do \nnot increase the series resistance of the current path. When an overcurrent condition is detected, the device \nmaintains a constant output current and reduces the output voltage accordingly. Complete shutdown occurs only \nif the fault is present long enough to activate thermal limiting.\nThere are two kinds of current limit profiles for the TPS20xx family of devices.\nAll devices (excluding TPS2065DBV) have an output I vs V characteristic similar to the plot labeled Current \nLimit with Peaking  in Figure 9-4 . This type of limiting can be characterized by two parameters, the overcurrent \ntrip threshold (I OC), and the short-circuit output current threshold (I OS).\nDevices TPS2065DBV have an output I vs V characteristic similar to the plot labeled Flat Current Limit  in \nFigure 9-4 . This type of limiting can be characterized by one parameters, the short circuit current (I OS).\nVOUT\nIOUTIOSDecreasing\nLoad\nResistanceVIN\n0 A0 VSlope = -R DS(ON)\nVOUT\nIOUT IOSDecreasing\nLoad\nResistanceVIN\n0 A0 VSlope = -R DS(ON)\nIOCCurrent Limit\nwith PeakingFlat Current\nLimit\nFigure 9-4. Current Limit Profiles\n9.7.1 Overcurrent Conditions (All Devices Excluding TPS2065DBV)\nThree possible overload conditions can occur for all devices exclude TPS2065DBV. In the first condition, the \noutput has been shorted before the device is enabled or before V I(IN) has been applied (see Figure 7-20  through \nFigure 7-22 ). The TPS20xx senses the short and immediately switches into a constant-current output.\nIn the second condition, a short or an overload occurs while the device is enabled. At the instant the overload \noccurs, high currents may flow for a short period of time before the current-limit circuit can react. After the \ncurrent-limit circuit has tripped (reached the overcurrent trip threshold (I OC)), the device switches into constant-\ncurrent mode and current is limited at the short-circuit output current threshold (I OS).\nIn the third condition, the load has been gradually increased beyond the recommended operating current. The \ncurrent is permitted to rise until the overcurrent trip threshold (I OC) is reached or until the thermal limit of the \ndevice is exceeded. The TPS20xxB is capable of delivering current up to the current-limit threshold without \ndamaging the device. Once the overcurrent trip threshold (I OC) has been reached, the device switches into its \nconstant-current mode current is limited at the short-circuit output current threshold (I OS).TPS2061, TPS2062, TPS2063\nTPS2065, TPS2066, TPS2067\nSLVS490J – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED AUGUST 2023\n www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2061  TPS2062  TPS2063  TPS2065  TPS2066  TPS2067\n9.7.2 Overcurrent Conditions (TPS2065DBV)\nThree possible overload conditions can occur for TPS2065DBV. In the first condition, the output has been \nshorted before the device is enabled or before V I(IN) has been applied (see Figure 7-38  through Figure 7-41 ). \nThe TPS20xx senses the short and immediately switches into a constant-current output.\nIn the second condition, a short or an overload occurs while the device is enabled. At the instant the overload \noccurs, high currents may flow for a short period of time before the current-limit circuit can react. After the \nshort-circuit output current threshold (I OS) is reached, the device switches into constant-current mode.\nIn the third condition, the load has been gradually increased beyond the recommended operating current. After \nthe short-circuit output current threshold (I OS) is reached, the device switches into constant-current mode.\n9.8 Overcurrent ( OCx)\nThe OCx open-drain output is asserted (active low) when an overcurrent or overtemperature condition is \nencountered. The output remains asserted until the overcurrent or overtemperature condition is removed. A 10-\nms deglitch circuit prevents the OCx signal from oscillation or false triggering. If an overtemperature shutdown \noccurs, the OCx is asserted instantaneously.\n9.9 Thermal Sense\nThe TPS206x implements a thermal sensing to monitor the operating temperature of the power distribution \nswitch. In an overcurrent or short-circuit condition the junction temperature rises. When the die temperature rises \nto approximately 140°C due to overcurrent conditions, the internal thermal sense circuitry turns off the switch, \nthus preventing the device from damage. Hysteresis is built into the thermal sense, and after the device has \ncooled approximately 10 degrees, the switch turns back on. The switch continues to cycle off and on until the \nfault is removed. The open-drain false reporting output ( OCx) is asserted (active low) when an overtemperature \nshutdown or overcurrent occurs.\n9.10 Undervoltage Lockout\nA voltage sense circuit monitors the input voltage. When the input voltage is below approximately 2 V, a control \nsignal turns off the power switch.\nwww.ti.comTPS2061, TPS2062, TPS2063\nTPS2065, TPS2066, TPS2067\nSLVS490J – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED AUGUST 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2061  TPS2062  TPS2063  TPS2065  TPS2066  TPS2067\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n10.1 Application Information\n10.1.1 Power-supply Considerations\nIN\nOC1\nEN1\nOC22\n8\n57\n0.1 µF 22 µF\n0.1 µF 22 µFLoad\nLoadOUT1\nOUT2Power Supply\n2.7 V to 5.5 V\n6\nEN23\n4\nGND0.1 µFTPS2062\n1\nFigure 10-1. Typical Application\nA 0.01- μF to 0.1- μF ceramic bypass capacitor between IN and GND, close to the device, is recommended. \nPlacing a high-value electrolytic capacitor on the output pin(s) is recommended when the output load is heavy. \nThis precaution reduces power-supply transients that may cause ringing on the input. Additionally, bypassing the \noutput with a 0.01-μF to 0.1-μF ceramic capacitor improves the immunity of the device to short-circuit transients.\n10.1.2 OC Response\nThe OCx open-drain output is asserted (active low) when an overcurrent or overtemperature shutdown \ncondition is encountered after a 10-ms deglitch timeout. The output remains asserted until the overcurrent or \novertemperature condition is removed. Connecting a heavy capacitive load to an enabled device can cause a \nmomentary overcurrent condition; however, no false reporting on OCx occurs due to the 10-ms deglitch circuit. \nThe TPS206x is designed to eliminate false overcurrent reporting. The internal overcurrent deglitch eliminates \nthe need for external components to remove unwanted pulses. OCx is not deglitched when the switch is turned \noff due to an overtemperature shutdown.\nGND\nIN\nEN1\nEN2OC1\nOC2OUT1\nOUT2TPS2062RpullupV+\nFigure 10-2.

The thermal resistances of these packages are high compared to those of power packages; it is good \ndesign practice to check power dissipation and junction temperature. Begin by determining the r DS(on)  of the \nN-channel MOSFET relative to the input voltage and operating temperature. As an initial estimate, use the \nhighest operating ambient temperature of interest and read r DS(on)  from Figure 7-11 . Using this value, the power \ndissipation per switch can be calculated by:\n•PD = rDS(on) × I2\nMultiply this number by the number of switches being used. This step renders the total power dissipation from \nthe N-channel MOSFETs.\nThe thermal resistance, R θJA = 1 / (DERATING FACTOR), where DERATING FACTOR is obtained from the \nDissipation Ratings Table. Thermal resistance is a strong function of the printed circuit board construction , and \nthe copper trace area connecting the integrated circuit.\nFinally, calculate the junction temperature:\n•TJ = P D x R θJA + T A\nWhere:\n•TA= Ambient temperature °C\n•RθJA = Thermal resistance\n•PD = Total power dissipation based on number of switches being used.\nCompare the calculated junction temperature with the initial estimate. If they do not agree within a few degrees, \nrepeat the calculation, using the calculated value as the new estimate. Two or three iterations are generally \nsufficient to get a reasonable answer.\n10.1.4 Thermal Protection\nThermal protection prevents damage to the IC when heavy-overload or short-circuit faults are present for \nextended periods of time. The TPS206x implements a thermal sensing to monitor the operating junction \ntemperature of the power distribution switch. In an overcurrent or short-circuit condition, the junction temperature \nrises due to excessive power dissipation. Once the die temperature rises above a minimum of 135°C due \nto overcurrent conditions, the internal thermal sense circuitry turns the power switch off, thus preventing the \npower switch from damage. Hysteresis is built into the thermal sense circuit, and after the device has cooled \napproximately 10°C, the switch turns back on. The switch continues to cycle in this manner until the load fault or \ninput power is removed. The OCx open-drain output is asserted (active low) when an overtemperature shutdown \nor overcurrent occurs.\n10.1.5 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nAn undervoltage lockout ensures that the power switch is in the off state at power up. Whenever the input \nvoltage falls below approximately 2 V, the power switch is quickly turned off. This facilitates the design of \nhot-insertion systems where it is not possible to turn off the power switch before input power is removed. The \nUVLO also keeps the switch from being turned on until the power supply has reached at least 2 V, even if the \nswitch is enabled. On reinsertion, the power switch is turned on, with a controlled rise time to reduce EMI and \nvoltage overshoots.\n10.1.6 Universal Serial Bus (USB) Applications\nThe universal serial bus (USB) interface is a 12-Mb/s, or 1.5-Mb/s, multiplexed serial bus designed for low-to-\nmedium bandwidth PC peripherals (e.g., keyboards, printers, scanners, and mice). The four-wire USB interface \nis conceived for dynamic attach-detach (hot plug-unplug) of peripherals. Two lines are provided for differential \ndata, and two lines are provided for 5-V power distribution.\nUSB data is a 3.3-V level signal, but power is distributed at 5 V to allow for voltage drops in cases where power \nis distributed through more than one hub across long cables. Each function must provide its own regulated 3.3 V \nfrom the 5-V input or its own internal power supply.\nwww.ti.comTPS2061, TPS2062, TPS2063\nTPS2065, TPS2066, TPS2067\nSLVS490J – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED AUGUST 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2061  TPS2062  TPS2063  TPS2065  TPS2066  TPS2067\nThe USB specification defines the following five classes of devices, each differentiated by power-consumption \nrequirements:\n•Hosts/self-powered hubs (SPH)\n•Bus-powered hubs (BPH)\n•Low-power, bus-powered functions\n•High-power, bus-powered functions\n•Self-powered functions\nSPHs and BPHs distribute data and power to downstream functions. The TPS206x has higher current capability \nthan required by one USB port; so, it can be used on the host side and supplies power to multiple downstream \nports or functions.\n10.1.7 Host/Self-Powered and Bus-powered Hubs\nHosts and SPHs have a local power supply that powers the embedded functions and the downstream ports \n(see Figure 10-3 ). This power supply must provide from 5.25 V to 4.75 V to the board side of the downstream \nconnection under full-load and no-load conditions. Hosts and SPHs are required to have current-limit protection \nand must report overcurrent conditions to the USB controller. Typical SPHs are desktop PCs, monitors, printers, \nand stand-alone hubs.\nIN\nOC1\nEN1\nOC2\nEN2\nGND0.1 µF2\n8\n3\n5\n4733 µF\n33 µFGND\n1OUT1TPS2062Power SupplyD+\nD−\nVBUS\nGNDD+\nD−\nVBUSDownstream\nUSB Ports\nUSB\nController3.3 V 5 V\n33 µF GNDOUT2D+\nD−\nVBUS\n33 µF GNDD+\nD−\nVBUS60.1 µF\n0.1 µF\n0.1 µF\n0.1 µF\nFigure 10-3. Typical Four-Port USB Host / Self-Powered Hub\nBPHs obtain all power from upstream ports and often contain an embedded function. The hubs are required \nto power up with less than one unit load. The BPH usually has one embedded function, and power is always \navailable to the controller of the hub. If the embedded function and hub require more than 100 mA on power \nup, the power to the embedded function may need to be kept off until enumeration is completed. This can be \naccomplished by removing power or by shutting off the clock to the embedded function. Power switching the \nembedded function is not necessary if the aggregate power draw for the function and controller is less than one TPS2061, TPS2062, TPS2063\nTPS2065, TPS2066, TPS2067\nSLVS490J – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED AUGUST 2023\n www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2061  TPS2062  TPS2063  TPS2065  TPS2066  TPS2067\nunit load. The total current drawn by the bus-powered device is the sum of the current to the controller, the \nembedded function, and the downstream ports, and it is limited to 500 mA from an upstream port.\n10.1.8 Low-power Bus-powered and High-Power Bus-Powered Functions\nBoth low-power and high-power bus-powered functions obtain all power from upstream ports; low-power \nfunctions always draw less than 100 mA; high-power functions must draw less than 100 mA at power up and can \ndraw up to 500 mA after enumeration. If the load of the function is more than the parallel combination of 44 Ω \nand 10 μF at power up, the device must implement inrush current limiting (see Figure 10-4 ). With TPS206x, the \ninternal functions could draw more than 500 mA, which fits the needs of some applications such as motor driving \ncircuits.\nIN\nOC1\nOC22\n8\n3\n5\n47\n0.1 µF 10 µFInternal\nFunctionOUT1Power Supply\n3.3 V\nEN1\n6\n0.1 µF 10 µFOUT2 Internal\nFunction0.1 µF 10 µF\nUSB\nControlGNDVBUSD−D+TPS2062\nEN2\nGND\n1\nFigure 10-4. High-Power Bus-Powered Function\n10.1.9 USB Power-distribution Requirements\nUSB can be implemented in several ways, and, regardless of the type of USB device being developed, several \npower-distribution features must be implemented.\n•Hosts/SPHs must:\n–Current-limit downstream ports\n–Report overcurrent conditions on USB V BUS\n•BPHs must:\n–Enable/disable power to downstream ports\n–Power up at <100 mA\n–Limit inrush current (<44 Ω and 10 μF)\n•Functions must:\n–Limit inrush currents\n–Power up at <100 mA\nThe feature set of the TPS206x allows them to meet each of these requirements. The integrated current-limiting \nand overcurrent reporting is required by hosts and self-powered hubs. The logic-level enable and controlled \nrise times meet the need of both input and output ports on bus-powered hubs, as well as the input ports for \nbus-powered functions (see Figure 10-5 ).\nwww.ti.comTPS2061, TPS2062, TPS2063\nTPS2065, TPS2066, TPS2067\nSLVS490J – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED AUGUST 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2061  TPS2062  TPS2063  TPS2065  TPS2066  TPS2067\nDP1\nDM1\nDP2\nDM2\nDP3\nDM3\nDP4\nPWRON1\nOVRCUR1\nPWRON2\nOVRCUR2DM4DP0\nDM0\nVCC\nXTAL1\nXTAL2\nOCSOFFSN75240D +\nD −\n 5 VGND\nD +\nD −\n 5 V\nD +\nD −\n 5 V\nD +\nD −\n 5 V48-MHz\nCrystalDownstream\nPortsTUSB2040\nHub Controller\nTuning\nCircuitA\nBC\nD\n33 µF†\nSN75240A\nBC\nD\nGNDGND\nGND33 µF†\n33 µF†\n33 µF†D +\nD −Upstream\nPort\nTPS2041BSN75240\nA\nB\n5 VGNDC\nD\n1 µFIN\nGNDFerrite Beads\nFerrite Beads\nFerrite Beads\nFerrite BeadsBUSPWR\nGANGEDTie to TPS2041 EN  Input\nOC EN\nOUT5-V Power\nSupply\nIN\nGND3.3 V4.7 µF0.1 µF\n4.7 µF\nEN1\nINOC1OUT1TPS2062\nEN2\nOC2OUT2\n0.1 µFGND\n†USB rev 1.1 requires 120 µF per hub.TPS76333Figure 10-5. Hybrid Self / Bus-Powered Hub Implementation\n10.1.10 Generic Hot-Plug Applications\nIn many applications it may be necessary to remove modules or pc boards while the main unit is still operating. \nThese are considered hot-plug applications. Such implementations require the control of current surges seen by \nthe main power supply and the card being inserted. The most effective way to control these surges is to limit \nand slowly ramp the current and voltage being applied to the card, similar to the way in which a power supply \nnormally turns on. Due to the controlled rise times and fall times of the TPS206x, these devices can be used to \nprovide a softer start-up to devices being hot-plugged into a powered system. The UVLO feature of the TPS206x \nalso ensures that the switch is off after the card has been removed, and that the switch is off during the next \ninsertion. The UVLO feature insures a soft start with a controlled rise time for every insertion of the card or \nmodule.TPS2061, TPS2062, TPS2063\nTPS2065, TPS2066, TPS2067\nSLVS490J – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED AUGUST 2023\n www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2061  TPS2062  TPS2063  TPS2065  TPS2066  TPS2067\nPower\nSupply\n0.1 µF1000 µF\nOptimum2.7 V to 5.5 VPC Board\nOvercurrent ResponseTPS2062\nOC1 GND\nEN1IN\nEN2OUT1\nOUT2\nOC2\nBlock of\nCircuitryBlock of\nCircuitryFigure 10-6.
