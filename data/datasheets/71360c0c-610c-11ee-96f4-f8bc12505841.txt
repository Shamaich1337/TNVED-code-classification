Genera Description  \nGT25Q40/20/10/05C  is 4Mb/2Mb/1Mb/512Kb  bits Serial NOR Flash,  the array is organized into 2048 programmable pages of \n256-bytes each. Up to 256 bytes can be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in groups of 4 (1Kb sector erase), groups \nof 16 (4KB Sector  erase) , groups of 128 (32KB block erase), groups of 256 (64KB block erase) or the entire chi p (chip erase) , \nThe device operates on a single 1.65V to 3.6V  power supply with current consumption as low as 1 uA Standby  current  and 0.1µA \nfor power -down. All devi ces are offered in space -saving packages.  \nThe GT25Q40/20/10/05C  supports the standard Serial  Peripheral Interface (SPI), and a high performance Dual/Quad output as \nwell as Dual/Quad I/O SPI: Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data I/O0 (DI), I/O1 (DO), I/O2 (/WP), and I/O3 (/HOLD). SPI clo ck \nfrequencies of up to 120MHz  are supported allowing equiv alent clock rates of 2 40MHz ( 120MHz  x 2) for Dual I/O and 4 80MHz \n(120MHz  x 4) for Quad I/O when using the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O instructions.   \nA Hold pin, Write Protect pin and programmable write protection, with top,bottom or complement array control, provide further  \ncontrol flexibility. Additionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device identification with a 64 -bit Unique \nID. GT25Q40/20/10/05C  features a serial peripheral interface and software protocol allowing operation on a simple 3 -wire bus  \nwhile it is in single I/O mode. The three bus signals are a clock input ( CLK), a serial data input ( DI), and a serial  data output ( DO). \nSerial access to the device is enabled by CS# input.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               7/81 \n3.Package Types:  \nGT25Q40/20/10/05C  is offered in an 8 -pin plastic 208mil/150 -mil width SOIC (package code W/G),an 8 -pad WSON 6X5 -mm \n(package code WS) ,an 8 -pad USON 2x3 -mm (package  code ED), an 8-pin TSSOP  (package code Z) and 8 ball WLCSP as  \nbelow .Package diagrams and dimensions are illustrated at the end of this datasheet.  \n3.1 Pin Configuration  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOP8  208mil/150mil and TSSOP                       WSON  8x6 / USON 2x3  \n \n \n       Top View                                 Bottom View  \n \nVDD\nGNDCS#\nSO\nsclk wp\nsi hd\n \nCS#si hd\nVDDwp sclk\nGND SO  \n \n \n8Ball WLCSP  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CS# \nDO \n(I01) \nVSS VCC  \nHOLD # \n(IO3) \nCLK \nDI \n(IO0)  WP#  \n(I02) 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 8 \n7 \n6\n0 \n5 CS# \nDO \n(I01) \nWP#  \n(I02) \nVSS VCC  \nHOLD # \n(IO3) \nCLK \nDI \n(IO0)  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 8 \n7 \n6\n0 \n5 \nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               8/81 \n3.2 Pin Description  \nPin Name  I/O Function  \n/CS I Chip Select  Input  \nDO(IO1)  I/O Data Output  (Data  Input  Output 1)*1 \n/WP(I/O2)  I/O Write  Protect Input  ( Data Input  Output  \n2)*2 \nGND   Ground  \nDI(I/O0)  I/O Data  Input  (Data Input  Output 0)*1 \nCLK I Serial Clock Input  \n/HOLD(I/O3)  I/O Hold Input (Data Input  Output  3)*2 \nVCC   Power Supply  \n3.3 Chip Select (/CS)  \nThe SPI Chip Select (/CS) pin enables and disables device operation. When /CS is high the device is  deselected and the Serial \nData Output (DO, or IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3) pins are at high impedance. When  deselected, the devices power consumption will be at \nstandby levels unless an internal erase, program or  write status register cycle is in progress. When /CS is brought low the device \nwill be selected, power  consumption will increase to act ive levels and  figuFre instructions can be written to and data read from the \ndevice.After power -up, /CS must transition from high to low before a new instruction will be accepted. The /CS  input must track \nthe VCC supply level at power -up (see “Write Protec tion”). If needed a pull -up resister on /CS can be used to accomplish this.  \n3.4 Serial Data Input, Output and IOs (DI, DO and IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3)  \nThe GT25Q40/20/10/05C  supports standard SPI, Dual SPI and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI instructions  use th e \nunidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the  rising edge of the Serial Clock \n(CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidirectional DO (output) to  read data or status from the device on the fall ing edge \nof CLK.  \nDual and Quad SPI instructions use the bidirectional IO pins to serially write instructions, addresses ordata to the device o n the \nrising edge of CLK and read data or status from the device on the falling edge of  CLK. Quad SPI instructions  require the non -\nvolatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set.When QE=1, the /WP pin becomes IO2 and /HOLD pin becomes IO3.  \n3.5 Write Protect (/WP)  \nThe Write Protect (/WP) pin can be used to prevent the Status Register from being written. U sed in  conjunction with the Status \nRegister’s Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0) bits and Status  Register Protect ( SRP) bits, a portion as small as \na 4KB sector or the entire memory array can be  hardware protected. The /WP pin is active low. Wh en the QE bit of Status Register -\n2 is set for Quad I/O,the /WP pin function is not available since this pin is used for IO2.  \n3.6 HOLD (/HOLD)  \nThe /HOLD pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. When /HOLD is brought low,while /CS is low, the DO \npin will be at high impedance and signals on the DI and CLK pins will be ignored  (don’t care). When /HOLD is brought high, device \noperation can resume. The /HOLD function can be  useful when multiple devices are sharing the same  SPI signals. The /HOLD \npin is active low. When the  QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, the /HOLD pin function is not available since this pin is  \nused for IO3. See the pin configuration of Quad I/O operation.  \n3.7 Serial Clock (CLK)  \nThe SPI Ser ial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and output operations.

Standard SPI instructions use the DI input pin to serially write i nstructions, \naddresses or da ta to the device on the rising edge of CLK. The DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on \nthe falling edge CLK.  \n \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 and Mode 3 concerns the \nnormal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and data is not being transferred to the Serial Flash. F or \nMode 0, the CLK signal is normally low on the falling and rising edges of /CS. For Mode 3, the CLK signal is normally high on  the \nfalling and rising edges of /CS.  \n \n7.2 Dual SPI Instructions  \nThe GT25Q40/20/10/05C  supports Dual SPI operation when using the “Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh) ” and “Fast Read Dual I/O \n(BBh)” instructions. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the device at  two to three times the rate of ordinary \nSerial Flash devices. The Dual SPI Read instructions are ideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -\nshadowing ) or for executing non -speed -critical code directly from the SPI bus (XIP). When using Dual SPI instructions, the DI and \nDO pins become bidirectional I/O pins: IO0 and IO1.  \n \n7.3 Quad SPI Instructions  \nThe GT25Q40/20/10/05C  supports Quad SPI operation when  using the “Fast Read Quad Output (6Bh) ”, and “Fast Read Quad \nI/O (E bh)” instructions. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the device six to eight times the rate of ordinary \nSerial Flash. The Quad Read instructions offer a significan t improvement in continuous and random access transfer rates allowing \nfast code -shadowing to RAM or execution directly from the SPI bus (XIP). When using Quad SPI instructions the DI and DO pins \nbecome bidirectional IO0 and IO1, and the /WP and /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO3 respectively. Quad SPI instructions require \nthe non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set.  \n \n7.4 Hold Function  \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI operations, the /HOLD signal allows the GT25Q40/20/10/05C  operation to be paused while it is \nactively selected (when /CS is low). The /HOLD function may be useful in cases where the SPI data and clock signals are share d \nwith other devices. For example, consider if the page buffer was only partia lly written when a priority interrupt requires use of the \nSPI bus. In this case the /HOLD function can save the state of the instruction and the data in the buffer so programming can \nresume where it left off once the bus is available again. The /HOLD funct ion is only available for standard SPI and Dual SPI \noperation, not during Quad SPI. The Quad Enable Bit QE in Status Register -2 is used to determine if the pin is used as /HOLD \npin or data I/O pin. When QE=0 (factory default), the pin is /HOLD, when QE=1, the pin will become an I/O pin, /HOLD function is \nno longer available.  \n \nTo initiate a /HOLD condition, the device must be selected with /CS low. A /HOLD condition will activate on the falling edge of the \n/HOLD signal if the CLK signal is already low. If th e CLK is not already low the /HOLD condition will activate after the next falling \nedge of CLK. The /HOLD condition will terminate on the rising edge of the /HOLD signal if the CLK signal is already low. If t he \nCLK is not already low the /HOLD  condition wil l terminate after the next falling edge of CLK. During a /HOLD condition, the Serial \nData Output (DO) is high impedance, and Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored. The Chip Select (/CS) sign al \nshould be kept active low for the full dura tion of the /HOLD operation to avoid resetting the internal logic state of the device.  \n \n \n \n \nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               21/81 \n7.5 WRITE PROTECTION  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise and other adverse system conditions \nthat may compromise data integrity. To address this concern, the GT25Q40/20/10/05C  provides several means to protect the \ndata from inadvertent writes.  \n \n7.6 Write Protect Features  \n• Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n• Time delay write disable after Power -up  \n• Write enable/disable instructions and automatic write disable after erase or program  \n• Software and Hardware (/WP pi n) write protection using Status Register  \n• Write Protection using Power -down instruction  \n• Lock Down write protection until next power -up  \n• One Time Program (OTP) write protection*  \n* Note: This feature is available upon special order. Please contact Giantec  for details.  \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down, the GT25Q40/20/10/05C  will maintain a reset condition while VCC is below the threshold value \nof VWI, (See Power -up Timing and Voltage Levels). While reset, all operations are disabled and no instructions are recognized. \nDuring power -up and after the VCC voltage exceeds VWI, al l program and erase related instructions are further disabled for a \ntime delay of Tpuw . This includes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase and the Write Status \nRegister instructions. Note that the chip select pin (/CS) must  track the VCC supply level at power -up until the VCC -min level and \nTvsl time delay is reached. If needed a pull -up resister on /CS can be used to accomplish this.  \n \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Statu s Register Write Enable Latch (WEL) set \nto a 0. A Write Enable instruction must be issued before a Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase or Write Statu s \nRegister instruction will be accepted. After completing a program, erase or write instruc tion the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is \nautomatically cleared to a write -disabled state of 0.  \n \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instruction and setting the Status Regist er Protect \n(SRP, SRL) and Block Protec t (CMP, SEC,TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0) bits. These settings allow a portion as small as 4KB sector or \nthe entire memory array to be configured as read only. Used in conjunction with the Write Protect (/WP) pin, changes to the S tatus \nRegister can be enabled or d isabled under hardware control. See Status Register section for further information. Additionally, the \nPower -down instruction offers an extra level of write protection as all instructions are ignored except for the Release Power -down \ninstruction.  \n \n8 STATUS  REGISTERS AND INSTRUCTIONS  \nThe Read Status Register -1 and Status Register -2 instructions can be used to provide status on the availability of the Flash \nmemory array, if the device is write enabled or disabled, the state of write protection, Quad SPI setting, Security Register lock \nstatus and Erase/Program Suspend status. The Write Status Register instruction can be used to configure the device write \nprotection features, Quad SPI setting and Security Register OTP lock. Write access to the Status Regist er is controlled by the \nstate of the non -volatile Status Register Protect bits ( SRP, SRL), the Write Enable instruction, and during Standard/Dual SPI \noperations, the /WP pin.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               22/81 \n8.1 STATUS REGISTER 1  \n \n \n \n \nStatus Register Protect (non-volatile)  \n \nSector Protect (non-volatile)  \n \nTop/Bottom Protect (non-volatile)  \n \nBlock Protect Bits (non-volatile)  \n \nWrite Enable Latch  \n \nErase/Write In progress  \nStatus Register -1 \n8.1.1 BUSY Status (BUSY)  \nBUSY is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is executing a Page Program, Qua d \nPage Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register or Erase/Program Security Register instruction. \nDuring  this time the device will ignore further instructions except for the Read Status Register and Erase/Program Suspend \ninstruction (see Tw, Tpp, Tse, Tbe, and Tce in AC Characteristics) ,and each Read Staus Register must pull down and up CS# . \nWhen the program , erase or write status/security register instruction has completed, the BUSY bit will be cleared to a 0 state \nindicating the device is ready for further instructions.  \n \n8.1.2 Write Enable Latch Status (WEL)  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the status register (S1) that is set to 1 after executing a Write Enable Instr uction. \nThe WEL status bit is cleared to 0 when the device is write disabled. A write disable state occurs upon power -up or after a ny of \nthe following instructions: Write Disable, Page Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write \nStatus Register, Erase Security Register and Program Security Register.  \n \n8.1.3 Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0)  \nThe Block Pro tect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register (S4, S3, and S2) that provide Write \nProtection control and status. Block Protect bits can be set using the Write Status Register Instruction (see Tw in AC \ncharacteristics). A ll, none or a portion of the memory array can be protected from Program and Erase instructions (see Status \nRegister Memory Protection table). The factory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of the array protecte d. \n \n8.1.4 Top/Bottom Block Protect (TB)  \nThe non -volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect from the Top (TB=0) or the \nBottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in the Status Register Memory Protection table. The factory defaul t setting is TB=0. The \nTB bit can be set with the Write Status Register Instruction depending on the state of the SRP and WEL bits.  \n \n8.1.5 Sector/Block Protect (SEC)  \nThe non -volatile Sector/Block Protect bit (SEC) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2,  BP1, BP0) protect either 4KB Sectors \n(SEC=1) or 64KB Blocks (SEC=0) in the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in the Status Register Memory \nProtection table.

The SUS status bit is cleared to 0 by Erase/Program Resume ( 7AH or 30H ) instruction as well as a \npower -down, power -up cycle.  \n \n8.2.2 Complement Protect (CMP)  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S14). It is used in conjunction with SEC, \nTB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits to provide more flexibility for the array protection. Once CMP is set to 1, previous array protect ion set \nby SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 will be reversed. For instance, when CMP=0, a top 4KB sector can be protected while the rest of \nthe array is not; when CMP=1, the top 4KB sector will become unprotected while the rest of the array become read -only. Plea se \nrefer to the Status Register Memory Protection table for details. The default setting is CMP=0.

The default state of LB  is 0, Securi ty Registers are unlocked. LB  can be set \nto 1 individually using the Write St atus Register instruction. LB  are One Time Programmable (OTP), once it ’s set to 1, the \ncorresponding 4x256-Byte Security Register will become read -only permanently.  \n8.2.4 Quad Enable (QE) – Non-Volatile Writa ble  \nThe Quad Enable (QE) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S9) that allows Quad SPI operation. When the QE \nbit is set to a 0 state (factory default), the /WP pin and /HOLD are enabled. When the QE bit is set to a 1, the Quad IO2  and IO3 \npins are enabled, and /WP and /HOLD functions are disabled.  \nWARNING: If the /WP or /HOLD pins are tied directly to the power supply or ground during standard SPI or Dual SPI \noperation, the QE bit should never be set to a 1.  \n \n8.2.5  Lock Down and OTP ( SRP1 )  \nThe Status Register Protect (SRP1 and SRP0) bits are non -volatile Read/Write bits in the status register. The SRP bits control \nthe method of write protection: software protection, hardware protection, power supply lock -down or one time programmable \nprotection.  \nSRP1  SRP0  Status Protection  Description  \n1 0 Lock -Down( 1) \n(temporary/Volatile)  Status Register is locked by standard status register write command and can \nnot be written to again until the next power -down, power -up cycle.  \n1 1 One Time Program( 2) \n(Permanently/Non -Volatile)  Status Registeris permanently lockedby special command flow*and can not be \nwritten to  \nNote : \n1.

Then, the one -byte command code must be shifted in to the device, with most significant bit \nfirst on DI, and each bit is latched on the rising edges of CLK.  \n \nSee below Table, every command sequence starts with a one -byte command code. Depending on the command, this might be \nfollowed by address bytes, or by data bytes, or by both or none. CS# must be driven high after the last bit of the command \nsequence has been completed. For the command of Read, Fast Read, Read Status Register o r Release from Deep Power - Down, \nand Read Device ID, the shifted -in command sequence is followed by a data -out sequence. CS# can be driven high after any bit \nof the data -out sequence is being shifted out.  \n \nFor the command of Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register, Write Enable, Write Disable \nor Deep Power -Down command, CS# must be driven high exactly at a byte boundary, otherwise the command is rejected, and is \nnot executed. That is CS# must be driven high when the number of clock pulses after CS# being driven low is an exact multiple \nof eight. For Page Program, if at any time the input byte is not a full byte, nothing will happen and WEL will not be reset.  \n \n9.1 Commands Table  \nCommand Name  Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4  Byte 5  Byte6  Byte N  \nNumber of Clock  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \nWrite Enable  06h       \nWrite Disable  04h       \nVolatile SR Write Enable  50h       \nRead Status Register1  05h S7-S0     continuous  \nRead Status Register2  35h S15-S8     continuous  \nRead Status Register 3 15h S23-S16     continuous  \nWrite Status Register 1 01H S7-S0 S15-S8     \nWrite Status Register 2 31H S15-S8      \nWrite Status Register 3 11H S23-S16      \nRead Data  03h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 (D7-D0) Next byte  continuous  \nFast Read  0Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy  (D7-D0) continuous  \nDual Output Fast Read  3Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy  (D7-D0) continuous  \nDual I/O Fast Read  BBH A23-A8(2)  A7-A0 M7 -\nM0(2)  (D7-D0)(1)    continuous  \nQuad Output  \nFast Read  6BH A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy  (D7-D0)(3)  continuous  \nQuad I/O Fast Read  EBH A23-A0 \nM7-M0(4)  dummy(5)  (D7-D0)(3)    continuous  \nPage Program  02H A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0 Next byte   \nQuad Page Program  32H A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0 Next byte   \nSector Erase( 1KB) 82H A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0    \nSector Erase(4KB)  20H A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0    \nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               32/81 \nCommand Name  Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4  Byte 5  Byte6  Byte N  \nBlock Erase(32KB)  52H A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0    \nBlock Erase(64K)  D8H A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0    \nChip Erase  C7/60H        \nEnable Reset  66H       \nReset  99H       \nSet Burst with Wrap  77H xx xx xx,  \nW6-W4      \nProgram/Erase Suspend  75H or \nB0H       \nProgram/Erase Resume  7AH or \n30H       \nDeep Power -Down  B9H       \nRelease From Deep  \nPower -Down, And  \nRead Device ID  ABH dummy  dummy  dummy  (ID7-ID0)  continuous  \nManufacturer / Device ID  90H dummy  dummy  00h (M7-M0) (ID7-ID0) continuous  \nManufacturer/ Device ID by \nDual I/O  92H A23-A8 A7-A0, \nM[7:0]  (M7-M0) \n(ID7-ID0)   continuous  \nManufacturer/  \nDevice ID by Quad I/O  94H A23-A0, \nM[7:0]  dummy  (M7-M0) \n(ID7-ID0)   continuous  \nRead Identification  9FH (M7-M0) (ID15 -ID8) (ID7-ID0)   continuous  \nRead Unique ID  4Bh  dummy  dummy  dummy  dummy  UID63 -0)  \nRead SFDP Register  5AH A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy   continuous  \nErase Security \nRegisters(8)  \n 44h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0    \nProgram Security \nRegisters(8)  42H A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0 D7-D0  \nRead Security Registers(8)  48H A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy  D7-D0  \n \nNOTE:  \n13.

This gives more flexibility to change the system \nconfiguration and memory protection schemes quickly without waiting for the typical non -volatile bit write cycles or affecting the \nendurance of the Stat us Register non -volatile bits.The Write Enable for Volatile Status Register command must be issued prior to \na Write Status Register command and any other commands can ’t be inserted between them. Otherwise, Write Enable for Volatile \nStatus Register will be cleared. The Write Enable for Volatile Status Register command will not set the Write Enable Latch bit, it \nis only valid for the Write Status Register command to change the volatile Status Register bit values.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure3. Write Enable for Volatile Status Register Sequence Diagram  \n9.6 Read Status Register (05h/35h/15h ) \nThe Read Status Register instructions allow the 8 -bit Status Registers to be read. The instruction is entered by driving /CS low \nand shifting the instruction code “05h” for Status Register -1 or “35h” for Status Register -2 or “15h” for Status Register -3 into the \nDI pin on the rising edge of CLK. The status register bits are then shifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with  most \nsignificant bit (MSB) first as shown in figure 4. The Status Register bits are shown in Status register1 and 2 include the BUSY, \nWEL, BP2 -BP0, TB, SEC, SRP, SRL, QE, LB, CMP and SUS bits (see Status Register section earlier in this datasheet).  \n \nThe Read Status Register instruction may be used at any time, even while a Program, Erase or Write Status Register cycle is i n \nprogress. This allows the BUSY status bit to be checked to determine when the cycle is complete and if the device can accept \nanother instruction. The Status Register can be read continuously, as shown in Figure 4. The instruction is completed by driving \n/CS high.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

The writable Status Register bits include: SRP, \nSEC, TB, BP[2:0] in Status Register -1; CMP, LB, QE, SRL in Status Register -2. All other Status Register bit locations are read -\nonly and will not be affected by the Write Status Register instruction. LB are non -volatile OTP bits, once it is set to 1, it cannot be \ncleared to 0.  \n \nTo write non -volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must previously ha ve been executed for the \ndevice to accept the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). Once write enabled, the instru ction \nis entered by driving /CS low, sending the instruction code “01 h/31h/11h ”, and then writing the stat us register data byte as \nillustrated in Figure 5a.  \n \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction must have been executed  prior \nto the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL remains 0). However, SRL and LB cannot be changed from “1”  \nto “0” because of the OTP protection for these bits. Upon power off or the execution of a Software/Hardware Reset, the volati le \nStatus Register bit values will be lost, and the non -volatile Status Register bit values will be restored.  \n \nDuring non -volatil e Status Register write o peration (06h combined with  01h/31h/11h , after /CS is driven high, the self -timed Write \nStatus Register cycle will commence for a time duration of Tw (See AC Characteristics). While the Write Status Register cycle is \nin progress, t he Read Status Register instruction may still be accessed to check the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 \nduring the Write Status Register cycle and a 0 when the cycle is finished and ready to accept other instructions again. After  the \nWrite Statu s Register cycle has finished, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register will be cleared to 0.  \n  \nDuring volatile Status Register write operation (50h combined with 01h/31h/11h ), after /CS is driven high, the Status Register bits \nwill be refre shed to the new values within the time period of Tshsl 2 (See AC Characteristics). BUSY bit will remain 0 during the \nStatus Register bit refresh period.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5a. Write Status Register Sequence Diagram  \n \n \nThe GT25Q40/20/10/05C  is als o backward compatible to Giantec ’s previous generations of serial flash  memories, in which the \nStatus Register -1&2 can be written using a single “Write Status Register -1 (01h)”command. To complete the Write Status \nRegister -1&2 instruction, the /CS pin must be driven high after  the sixteenth bit of data that is clocked in as sh own in Figure 9c & \n9d. If /CS is driven high after the eighth  clock, the Write Status Register -1 (01h) instruction will only program the Status Register -\n1, the Status  Register -2 will not be affected (Previous generations will clear CMP and QE bits).  \n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \nMode 0 Mode 3 /CS \nCLK \nDI \n(IO0) Instruction(0 1h/31h/11h) \nHigh Impedance  8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \nStatus Register 1/2/3 in  \n* \nDO \n(IO1) * = MSB  7 \n2 6 7 5 4 3 1 0 Mode 3  Mode 0 \nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               37/81 \n \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Instruction (01h) Status Register 1 in Status Register 2 inMode 3 Mode 3\n* *\nHigh Impedance\n=MSB*Mode 0 Mode 0\n \nFigure 5b.

Then the memory content, at that address, is shifted out on DO, and each bit is shifted out, at a Max frequency Fr, on the \nfalling edge of CLK. The first byte addressed can be at any location. The address is automatically incremented to the next higher \naddress after each byte of data is shifted out. The whole memory can, therefore, be read with a single Read Data Bytes (READ)  \ncommand. Any Read Data Bytes (READ) command, while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in progress, is rejected without \nhaving any effects on the cycle that is in progress.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6.

When “Wrap Around ” is enabled, the data being accessed can be limited to either an8/16/32/64 -\nbyte section of a 256 -byte page. The output data starts at the init ial address specified inthe command, once it reaches the ending \nboundary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, the output will wrap around the beginning boundary automatically until CS# is pulled high \nto terminate the command.  \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical address and then fill the cache af terwards \nwithin a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing multiple read commands. The “Set Burst with Wrap ” command \nallows three “Wrap Bits ” W6-W4 to be set. The W4 bit is used to enable or disable the “Wrap Around ” operation while W6-W5 \nisused to specify the length of the wrap around section within a page.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               45/81 \n9.14 Set Burst with Wrap (77H)  \nThe Set Burst with Wrap command is used in conjunction with “Quad I/O Fast Read ” command to access a fixed length of \n8/16/32/64 -byte section within a 256 -byte page, in standard SPI mode.  \n \nThe Set Burst with Wrap command  sequence: CS# goes low → Send Set Burst with Wrap command → Send 24 dummy bits → \nSend 8 bits “Wrap bits” → CS# goes high.  \n \nW6,W5  W4=0  W4=1 (Default)  \nWrap Around  Wrap Length  Wrap Around  Wrap Length  \n0, 0 Yes 8-byte No N/A \n0, 1 Yes 16-byte No N/A \n1, 0 Yes 32-byte No N/A \n1, 1 Yes 64-byte No N/A \n \nIf the W6 -W4 bits are set by theSet Burst with Wrap command, all the following “Quad I/O Fast Read ” command will use the W6 -\nW4 setting to access the 8/16/32/64 -byte section within any page. To exit the “Wrap Around ” function and return to normal read \noperation, another Set Burst with Wrap command should be issued to set W4=1.  \n \n \nFigure1 2 Set Burst with Wrap Sequence Diagram  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               46/81 \n9.15 Page Program (PP) (02H)  \nThe Page Program (PP) command is for programming the memory. A Write Enable (WREN) command must previously have \nbeen executed to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit before sending the Page Program command.  \n \nThe Page Program (PP) command is entered by dri ving CS# Low, followed by the command code, three address bytes and at \nleast one data byte on SI. If the 8 least significant address bits (A7 -A0) are not all zero, all transmitted data that goes beyond the \nend of the current page are programmed from the st art address of the same page (from the address whose 8 least significant bits \n(A7-A0) are all zero). CS# must be driven low for the entire duration of the sequence. The Page Program command sequence: \nCS# goes low → sending Page Program command → 3-byte add ress on DI → at least 1 byte data on DI → CS# goes high. The \ncommand sequence is shown in Figure1 3. If more than 256 bytes are sent to the device, previously latched data are discarded \nand the last 256 data bytes are guaranteed to be programmed correctly w ithin the same page. If less than 256 data bytes are sent \nto device, they are correctly programmed at the requested addresses without having any effects on the other bytes of the same  \npage. CS# must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last data byte  has been latched in; otherwise the Page Program (PP) \ncommand is not executed.  \n \nAs soon as CS# is driven high, the self -timed Page Program cycle (whose duration is Tpp) is initiated. While the Page Program \ncycle is in progress, the Status Register may be read to check the value of the Write in Progress ( BUSY ) bit. The Write in Progress \n(BUSY ) bit is 1 during the self -timed Page Program cycle, and is 0 when it is completed. At some unspecified time before the \ncycle is completed, the Write Enable Latch (W EL) bit is reset.  \n \nA Page Program (PP) command applied to a page which is protected by the Block Protect ( SEC, TB, BP2, BP1, and BP0) is not \nexecuted.  \n \n \nFigure1 3 Page Program Sequence Diagram  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               47/81 \n9.16 Quad Page Program (32H)  \nThe Quad Page Program command is for programming the memory using four pins: IO0, IO1, IO2, and IO3. To use Quad Page \nProgram the Quad enable in status register Bit9 must be set (QE=1).A Write Enable (WREN) command must previously  have \nbeen executed to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit before sending the Page Program command. The quad Page Program \ncommand is entered by driving CS# Low, followed by the command code (32H), three address bytes and at least one data byte \non IO pins.   \nThe command sequence is shown in Figure1 4 If more than 256 bytes are sent to the device, previously latched data are discarded \nand the last 256 data bytes are guaranteed to be programmed correctly within the same page. If less than 256 data bytes are s ent \nto device, they are correctly programmed at the requested addresses without having any effects on the other bytes of the same  \npage. CS# must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last data byte has been latched in; otherwise the Quad Page Program  \n(PP) command is not executed.  \nAs soon as CS# is driven high, the self -timed Quad Page Program cycle (whose duration is Tpp) is initiated. While the Quad Page \nProgram cycle is in progress, the Status Register may be read to check the value of the Write In Pr ogress ( BUSY ) bit. The Write \nin Progress ( BUSY ) bit is 1 during the self -timed Quad Page Program cycle, and is 0 when it is completed. At some unspecified \ntime before the cycle is completed, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset.  \nA Quad Page Program c ommand applied to a page which is protected by the Block Protect ( SEC, TB, BP2, BP1, and BP0) is not \nexecuted.  \n \nFigure1 4 Quad Page Program Sequence Diagram  \n\nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               48/81 \n9.17 Mini Sector Erase ( MSE) ( 82H)  \nThe Mini Sector Erase ( MSE) (82H) command is for erasing the all data of the chosen 1KB sector. A Write Enable (WREN) \ncommand must previously have been executed to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit. The  Mini Sector Erase ( MSE) command \nis entered by driving CS# low, followed by the command code, and 3 -address byte on SI. Any address inside the sector is a valid \naddress for the  Mini Sector Erase ( MSE) command. CS# must be driven low for the entire duration of the sequence.  \n \nThe Mini Sector Erase command sequence: CS# goes low → sending Sector Erase command → 3-byte address on DI → CS# \ngoes high. The command sequence is shown in Figure1 5. CS# must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last address byte \nhas been latched in; otherwise the Mini Sector Erase ( MSE) command is not executed.

CS# must be driven low for the entire duration of the sequence.  \n \nThe Sector Erase command sequence: CS# goes low → sending Sector Erase command → 3-byte address on DI → CS# goes \nhigh. The command sequence is shown in Figure1 5. CS# must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last address byte has \nbeen latched in; otherwise the Sector Erase (SE) command is not executed. As soon as CS# is driven high, the self -timed Sector \nErase cycle (whose durat ion is Tse) is initiated. While the Sector Erase cycle is in progress, the Status Register may be read to \ncheck the value of the Write in Progress ( BUSY ) bit.

It can also be used as an extra software protection mechanism, while the device is not in active use, since \nin this mode , the device ignores all Write, Program and Erase commands. Driving CS# high deselects the device, and puts the \ndevice in the Standby Mode (if there is no internal cycle currently in progress). But this mode is not the Deep Power -Down Mode. \nThe Deep Power -Down Mode can only be entered by executing the Deep Power -Down (DP) command. Once the device has \nentered the Deep Power -Down Mode, all commands are ignored except the Release from Deep Power -Down and Read Device \nID (RDI) command or software reset command. The Release from Deep Power -Down and Read Device ID (RDI) command \nreleases the device from Deep Power -Down mode, also allows the Device ID of the device to be output on DO.  \n \nThe Deep Power -Down Mode automatically stops at Power -Down, and the device always  in the Standby Mode after Power - Up.  \nThe Deep Power -Down command sequence: CS# goes low → sending Deep Power -Down command → CS# goes high. The \ncommand sequence is shown in Figure 19. CS# must be driven high after the eighth bit of the command code has bee n latched \nin; otherwise the Deep Power -Down (DP) command is not executed. As soon as CS# is driven high, it requires a delay of Tdp \nbefore the supply current is reduced to ICC2 and the Deep Power -Down Mode is entered. Any Deep Power - Down (DP) command, \nwhile an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in progress, is rejected without having any effects on the cycle that is in progres s. \n \n \nFigure20.

It can be used to release the device \nfrom the Power -Down state or obtain the devices electronic identification (ID) number.  \n \nTo release the device from the Power -Down state, the command is issued by driving the CS# pin low, shifting the instruction code \n“ABH” and driving CS# high as shown in Figure2 0. Release from Power -Down will take the time duration of Tres1 (See AC \nCharacter istics) before the device will resume normal operation and other command are accepted. The CS# pin must remain high \nduring the Tres1 time duration.  \n \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the Power -Down state, the command is initiated by driv ing the CS# pin low \nand shifting the instruction code “ABH” followed by 3 -dummy byte. The Device ID bits are then shifted out on the falling edge of \nCLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure2 1. The Device ID value is listed in Manufactur er and Device \nIdentification table. The Device ID can be read continuously. The command is completed by driving CS# high.  \n \nWhen used to release the device from the Power -Down state and obtain the Device ID, the command is the same as previously \ndescribed,  and shown in Figure2 1, except that after CS# is driven high it must remain high for a time duration of Tres2 (See AC \nCharacteristics). After this time duration the device will resume normal operation and other command will be accepted. If the  \nRelease from  Power -Down / Device ID command is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (when BUSY  \nequal 1) the command is ignored and will not have any effects on the current cycle.  \n \n \nFigure2 1.

After which, the Manufacturer ID and the Device ID are shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant \nbit (MSB) first as shown in Figure2 2.

After which, the Manufacturer ID and the Device ID are shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most \nsignificant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure2 3.

After which, the Manufacturer ID and the Device ID are shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most signific ant \nbit (MSB) first as shown in Figure2 4.

The device identification indicates the memory type in the first byte, and th e memory capacity of the device in the \nsecond byte. The Read Identification (RDID) command while an Erase or Program cycle is in progress, is not decoded, and has \nno effect on the cycle that is in progress. The Read Identification (RDID) command should not  be issued while the device is in \nDeep Power -Down Mode.  \n \nThe device is first selected by driving CS# low. Then, the 8 -bit command code for the command is shifted in. This is followed by \nthe 24 -bit device identification, stored in the memory. Each bit is s hifted out on the falling edge of Serial Clock. The command \nsequence is shown in Figure 2 5. The Read Identification (RDID) command is terminated by driving CS# high at any time during \ndata output. When CS# is driven high, the device is in the Standby Mode.  Once in the Standby Mode, the device waits to be \nselected, so that it can receive, decode and execute commands.  \n \n \nFigure2 6.Read Identification ID Sequence Diagram  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGT25Q40 /20/10/05C            \n \nGiantec Semiconductor  Corp                          www.giantec -semi.com  \n                               59/81 \n9.28 Read Unique ID Number (4Bh)  \nThe Read Unique ID Number instruction accesses a factory -set read -only 64 -bit number that is unique to each \nGT25Q40/20/10/05C  device. The ID number can be used in conjunction with user software methods to help prevent copying or \ncloning of a system. The Read Unique ID instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code  “4Bh” \nfollowed by a four bytes of dummy clocks. After which, the 64 - bit ID is shifted out on the falling edge of CLK as shown in figure \n26. \n \n \nFigure 27.

The Erase/Program Suspend \ninstruc tion sequence is shown in Figure27 .  \n \nThe Write Status Register instruction (01h) and Erase instruc tions (20h, 52h, D8h, C7h, 60h, 44h) are not allowed during Erase \nSuspend. Erase Suspend is valid only during the Sector or Block erase operation. If written during the Chip Erase operation, the \nErase Suspend instruction is ignored. The Write Status Regist er instruction (01h) and Program instructions (02h, 32h, 42h) are \nnot allowed during Program Suspend. Program Suspend is valid only during the Page Program or Quad Page Program operation.  \n \nThe Erase/Program Suspend instruction “ 75H or B0H ” will be accepte d by the device only if the SUS bit in the Status Register \nequals to 0 and the BUSY bit equals to 1 while a Sector or Block Erase or a Page Program operation is on -going. If the SUS bit \nequals to 1 or the BUSY bit equals to 0, the Suspend instruction will be ignored by the device. A maximum of time of “ Tsus ” (See \nAC Characteristics) is required to suspend the erase or program operation. The BUSY bit in the Status Register will be cleare d \nfrom 1 to 0 within “ Tsus ” and the SUS bit in the Status Register will be set from 0 to 1 immediately after Erase/Program Suspend. \nFor a previously resumed Erase/Program operation, it is also required that the Suspend instruction “ 75H or B0H ” is not issued \nearlier than a minimum of time of “ Tsus ” following the preceding Resum e instruction “ 7AH or 30H ”.  \n \nUnexpected power off during the Erase/Program suspend state will reset the device and release the suspend state. SUS bit in \nthe Status Register will also reset to 0. The data within the page, sector or block that was being suspended may become corrupted. \nIt is recommended for the user to implement system design techniques against the accidental power interruption and preserve \ndata integrity during erase/program suspend state.  \n \nFigure2 8.

The Resume instruction “ 7AH or 30H ” will be accepted by the device only if \nthe SUS bit in the Status Register equals to 1 and the BU SY bit equals to 0. After issued the SUS bit will be cleared from 1 to 0 \nimmediately, the BUSY bit will be set from 0 to 1 within 200ns and the Sector or Block will complete the erase operation or t he \npage will complete the program operation. If the SUS bi t equals to 0 or the BUSY bit equals to 1, the Resume instruction “ 7AH or \n30H” will be ignored by the device. The Erase/Program Resume instruction sequence is shown in Figure 28.  \n \nResume instruction is ignored if the previous Erase/Program Suspend operation was interrupted by unexpected power off. It is \nalso required that a subsequent Erase/Program Suspend instruction not to be issued within a minimum of time of “ Tsus ” following \na previous Resume instruction.  \n \nFigure 29.

The “Reset (99H)” command \nsequence as follow: CS# goes low → Sending Enable Reset command → CS# goes high → CS# goes low → Sending Reset \ncommand → CS# goes high. Once the Reset command is accepted by the device, the device will take approximately Trst/Trst_E \nto reset. During this period, no command will be accepted. Data corruption may happen if there is an on -going or suspended \ninternal Erase or Program operation when Reset command sequence is accepted by the device. It is recommended to check the \nBUSY bit and t he SUS bit in Status Register before issuing the Reset command sequence.  \n \n \nFigure 30.

Four 256 -Byte security \nregisters will be erased simultaneously . These registers may be used by the system manufacturers to store security and other \nimportant in formation separately from the main memory array.  \n \nThe Erase Security Register instruction is similar to the Sector Erase instruction. Once Nor flash received Erase Security Registers  \ncommand,4x256 -Byte security registers will be Erase at the same time, A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the \ndevice will accept the Erase Security Register Instruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiat ed by  \ndriving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “44h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) to erase one of the three \nsecurity registers.  \n \nADDRESS  A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 \nSecurity Register \n#1,#2,#3,#4  00h 00H Don’t Care  \n \n \nThe Erase Security Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 31. The /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of \nthe last byte has been latched. If this is not done the instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the self -timed Erase \nSecurity Register operation will commence for a time duration of Tse (See AC Characteristics). While the Erase Security Register \ncycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The  BUSY \nbit is a 1 during the erase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle  is finished and the device is ready to accept other instructions \nagain. After the Erase Security Register cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleare d to \n0. The Security Register Lock Bits LB in the Status Register -2 can be used to OTP protect the security registers. Once a lock bit \nis set to 1, the corresponding security register will be permanently locked, Erase Security Register instruction to that regi ster will  \nbe ignored.  \n \n \nFigure 3 2.

It allows from one byte to 256 bytes of \nsecurity register data to be programmed at previously erased (FFh) memory locations. A Write Enable instruction must be \nexecuted b efore the device will accept the Program Security Register Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The instruction is \ninitiated by driving the /CS pin low then shifting the instruction code “42h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least one \ndata byte, into the DI pin. The /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to th e device.  \n \nADDRESS  A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 00H Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 01H Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 02H Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 03H Byte Address  \n \nThe Program Security Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 32.

Once a lock bit is set to 1, the corresponding security register will \nbe permanently locked, Program Security Register instruction to that register will be ignored  \n \n \nFigure 3 3.

The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and then shifting the  instruction \ncode “48h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and eight “dummy” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are \nlatched on the rising edge of the CLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location w ill be \nshifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The byte address is automatically  \nincremented to the next byte address after each byte of data is shifted out. Once the byte address reaches the last byte of  the \nregister (byte FFh), it will reset to 00h, the first byte of the register, and continue to increment. The instruction is comp leted by \ndriving /CS high. The Read Security Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 33. If a Read Security Register instruction \nis issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effe cts \non the current cycle. The Read Security Register instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of FR (see A C Electrical \nCharacteristics).  \n \nADDRESS  A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 00H Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 01H Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 02H Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 03H Byte Address  \n \n \n \nFigure 34.
