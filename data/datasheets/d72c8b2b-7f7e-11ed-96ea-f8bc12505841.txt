The \nparts are designed to operate from a single 3 V supply. Built using a CBCMOS process, these monolithic DACs offer low  cost and ease of use in single-supply 3 V systems. Operation is guaranteed over the supply voltage range of 2.7 V to 5.5 V , \nmaking this device ideal for battery-operated applications. \nThe full-scale voltage output is determined by the external ref-\nerence input voltage applied. The rail-to-rail REF IN to DAC OUT \nallows a full-scale voltage equal to the positive supply V DD or \nany value in between. The voltage outputs are capable of sourc-\ning 5 mA. \nA data latch load of 12 bits with a 45 ns write time eliminates \nwait states when interfacing to the fastest processors. Addition-\nally, an asynchronous RS input sets the output to a zero scale at \npower-on or upon user demand. Both parts are offered with similar pinouts, which allows users \nto select the amount of resolution appropriate for their applica-\ntions without changing the circuit card. \nThe AD7392/AD7393 are specified for operation over the \nextended industrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C.  The AD7393AR is specified for the automotive temperature range of −40°C to +125°C. The AD7392/AD7393 are available \nin 20-lead PDIP and 20-lead SOIC packages.  \nFor serial data input, 8-lead packaged versions, see the AD7390 and AD7391. \nAD7392/AD7393  \n \nRev.

C | Page 12 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD7392/AD7393 comprise a set of pin-compatible, 12-/10-\nbit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). These single-supply operation devices consume less than 100 μA of current while operating from 2.7 V to 5.5 V power supplies, making them \nideal for battery-operated applications. They contain a voltage-\nswitched, 12-/10-bit, laser-trimmed DAC; rail-to-rail output op amps; and a parallel input DAC register. The external reference input has constant input resistance independent of the digital code setting of the DAC. In addition, the reference input can be \ntied to the same supply voltage as V\nDD, resulting in a maximum \noutput voltage span of 0 V to V DD. The parallel data interface \nconsists of a CS write strobe and 12 data bits (D0 to D11) if \nutilizing the AD7392 or 10 data bits (D0 to D9) if utilizing  \nthe AD7393. An RS pin is available to reset the DAC register to \nzero scale. This function is useful for power-on reset or system \nfailure recovery to a known state. Additional power savings are \naccomplished by activating the SHDN  pin, resulting in a 1.5 μA \nmaximum consumption sleep mode. While the supply voltage is \non, data is retained in the DAC register to reset the DAC output \nwhen the part is taken out of shutdown ( SHDN  = 1). \nDIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTERS \nThe voltage switched R-2R DAC generates an output voltage \nthat depends on the external reference voltage connected to  \nthe V REF pin according to Equation 1.   \nN REF OUTDV V2× =  (1) \nwhere: \nD is the decimal data-word loaded into the DAC register. \nN is the number of bits of DAC resolution.  \nIf the 10-bit AD7393 uses a 2.5 V reference, Equation 1 \nbecomes \n10245 . 2DVOUT× =  (2) \nUsing Equation 2, the nominal midscale voltage at V OUT is \n1.25 V , for D = 512; full-scale voltage is 2.497 V . The LSB  \nstep size is 2.5 × 1/1024 = 0.0024 V . \nIf the 12-bit AD7392 uses a 5.0 V reference, Equation 1 becomes \n4096DV VREF OUT × =  (3) \nUsing Equation 3, the AD7392 provides a nominal midscale volt-\nage of 2.50 V (for D = 2048) and a full-scale V OUT of 4.998 V . \nThe LSB step size is 5.0 × 1/4096 = 0.0012 V . AMPLIFIER SECTION \nThe internal DACs output is buffered by a low power consump-\ntion precision amplifier. The op amp has a 60 μs typical settling \ntime to 0.1% of full scale. There are slight differences in settling time for negative slew signals vs. positive. Also, negative tran-\nsition settling time to within the last 6 LSBs of 0 V has an extended \nsettling time. The rail-to-rail output stage of this amplifier has been designed to provide precision performance while operating near either power supply. \nFigure 27  shows an equivalent output \nschematic of the rail-to-rail amplifier with its N-channel pull-down FETs that pull an output load directly to GND. The \noutput sourcing current is provided by a P-channel, pull-up \ndevice that can source current-to-GND terminated loads. \n01121-028P-CH\nN-CHVDD\nVOUT\nAGND  \nFigure 27. Equivalent Analog Output Circuit \nThe rail-to-rail output stage provides ±1 mA of output current. \nThe N-channel output pull-down MOSFET, shown in Figure 27 , \nhas a 35 Ω on resistance that sets the sink current capability \nnear ground. In addition to resistive load driving capability, the \namplifier also has been carefully designed and characterized for \nup to 100 pF capacitive load driving capability.  \nREFERENCE INPUT \nThe reference input terminal has a constant input resistance \nindependent of digital code, which results in reduced glitches \non the external reference voltage source. The high 2.5 MΩ input resistance minimizes power dissipation within the AD7392/ \nAD7393 DACs. The V\nREF input accepts input voltages ranging \nfrom ground to the positive supply voltage V DD. One of the \nsimplest applications for saving an external reference voltage \nsource is connecting the REF terminal to the positive V DD \nsupply. This connection results in a rail-to-rail voltage output \nspan maximizing the programmed range. The reference input \naccepts ac signals as long as they stay within the 0 V < V REF < \nVDD supply voltage range. The reference bandwidth and integral \nnonlinearity error performance are plotted in Figure 20  and \nFigure 21 . The ratiometric reference feature makes the AD7392/ \nAD7393 an ideal companion to ratiometric analog-to-digital \nconverters (ADCs) such as the AD7896. \n  AD7392/AD7393\n \nRev. C | Page 13 of 20 POWER SUPPLY \nThe very low power consumption of the AD7392/AD7393 is  \na direct result of a circuit design that optimizes the CBCMOS \nprocess. By using the low power characteristics of CMOS for the \nlogic and the low noise, tight-matching of the complementary \nbipolar transistors, excellent analog accuracy is achieved. One \nadvantage of the rail-to-rail output amplifiers used in the AD7392/ AD7393 is the wide range of usable supply voltage.

Recommended Supply Bypassing for the AD7392/AD7393 \nINPUT LOGIC LEVELS \nAll digital inputs are protected with a Zener-type ESD protection \nstructure that allows logic input voltages to exceed the V DD supply \nvoltage (see Figure 30). This feature is useful if the user is driving \none or more of the digital inputs with a 5 V CMOS logic input \nvoltage level while operating the AD7392/AD7393 on a 3 V \npower supply. If this interface is used, make sure that the V OL  \nof the 5 V CMOS meets the V IL input requirement of the AD7392/ \nAD7393 operating at 3 V . See Figure 12 for a graph of digital \nlogic input threshold vs. operating V DD supply voltage. \n01121-031VDD\nLOGIC\nIN\nGND1kΩ\n \nFigure 30. Equivalent Digital Input ESD Protection To minimize power dissipation from input logic levels that  \nare near the V IH and V IL logic input voltage specifications, a \nSchmitt-trigger design was used that minimizes the input  buffer current consumption compared to traditional CMOS \ninput stages. Figure 11 is a plot of supply current vs. incremental \ninput voltage, showing that negligible current consumption takes place when logic levels are in their quiescent state. The normal crossover current still occurs during logic transitions.  \nA secondary advantage of this Schmitt trigger is the prevention \nof false triggers that would occur with slow moving logic transi-\ntions when a standard CMOS logic interface or opto-isolators \nare used. Logic inputs D11 to D0, CS\n, RS, and SHDN  all contain \nthe Schmitt-trigger circuits. \nDIGITAL INTERFACE \nThe AD7392/AD7393 have a parallel data input. A functional \nblock diagram of the digital section is shown in Figure 31,  \nwhile Table 6 contains the truth table for the logic control \ninputs. The chip select pin ( CS) controls loading of data from \nthe data inputs on Pin D11 to Pin D0. This active low input \nplaces the input register into a transparent state allowing the \ndata inputs to directly change the DAC ladder values. When  \nCS returns to logic high within the data setup-and-hold time \nspecifications, the new value of data in the input register are \nlatched.

C | Page 14 of 20 RESET PIN (RS ) \nForcing the asynchronous RS pin low sets the DAC register to \nall 0s, so the DAC output voltage is 0 V . The reset function is \nuseful for setting the DAC outputs to 0 at power-up or after a \npower supply interruption. Test systems and motor controllers \nare two of many applications that benefit from powering up to a \nknown state. The external reset pulse can be generated by three \nmethods: \n• The microprocessor’s power-on RESET signal \n• An output from the microprocessor \n• An external resistor and capacitor \nRESET has a Schmitt-trigger input, which results in a clean \nreset function when using external resistor-/capacitor-generated \npulses (see Table 6 ). \nPOWER SHUTDOWN (SHDN ) \nMaximum power savings can be achieved by using the power \nshutdown control function. This hardware-activated feature is \ncontrolled by the active low input SHDN  pin. This pin has a \nSchmitt-trigger input that helps desensitize it to slowly changing \ninputs. Setting this pin to logic low reduces the internal con-sumption of the AD7392/AD7393 to nanoamp levels, guaranteed to 1.5 μA maximum over the operating temperature range. If power is present at all times on the V\nDD pin while in shutdown \nmode, the internal DAC register retains the last programmed \ndata value. The digital interface is still active in shutdown so \nthat code changes can be made that produce new DAC settings when the device is taken out of shutdown. This data is used when the part is returned to the normal active state by placing \nthe DAC back to its programmed voltage setting. \nFigure 23  \nshows a plot of shutdown recovery time with both I DD and V OUT \ndisplayed. In the shutdown state, the DAC output amplifier \nexhibits an open-circuit high resistance state. Any load that is \nconnected stabilizes at its termination voltage. If the power \nshutdown feature is not needed, the user should tie the SHDN  \npin to the V DD voltage to disable this function. UNIPOLAR OUTPUT OPERATION \nThis is the basic mode of operation for the AD7392. The \nAD7392 is designed to drive loads as low as 5 kΩ in parallel \nwith 100 pF (see Figure 32 ). The code table for this operation is \nshown in Table 7 . \nThe circuit can be configured with an external reference  \nplus power supply or powered from a single dedicated regu- \nlator or reference depending on the application performance \nrequirements. \n01121-0321\n20 19\n17, 182.7VTO 5.5V\nVDD\nGNDAD7392\nVOUT VREFR\nRL\n≥5kΩCL\n≥100pF0.1µF 0.01µF 10µF\nNOTES\n1.

C | Page 15 of 20 BIPOLAR OUTPUT OPERATION \nAlthough the AD7393 is designed for single-supply operation, \nthe output can be easily configured for bipolar operation. A \ntypical circuit is shown in Figure 33 . This circuit uses a clean, \nregulated 5 V supply for power, which also provides the circuit’s \nreference voltage. Since the AD7393 output span swings from \nground to very near 5 V , it is necessary to choose an external amplifier with a common-mode input voltage range that extends to its positive supply rail. The micropower consumption OP196 is designed just for this purpose and results in only 50 μA of \nmaximum current consumption. Connecting the two 470 kΩ \nresistors results in a differential amplifier mode of operation \nwith a voltage gain of 2, which produces a circuit output span  of 10 V , that is, −5 V to +5 V . As the DAC is programmed from zero-code 0x000 to midscale 0x200 to full scale 0x3FF, the circuit output voltage, V\nO, is set at −5 V , 0 V , and +5 V (minus 1 LSB). \nThe output voltage, V O, is coded in offset binary according to \nEquation 4. \n5 1512×⎥⎦⎤\n⎢⎣⎡− =DVO   (4) \nwhere D is the decimal code loaded in the AD7393 DAC \nregister.  \nNote that the LSB step size is 10/1024 = 10 mV . This circuit  \nis optimized for micropower consumption including the 470 kΩ \ngain setting resistors, which should have low temperature \ncoefficients to maintain accuracy and matching (preferably the \nsame resistor material, such as metal film).  \nIf better stability is required, the power supply may be substi-\ntuted with a precision reference voltage such as the low dropout REF195, which can easily supply the circuit’s 162 μA of current, \nand still provide additional power for the load connected to V\nO. \nThe micropower REF195 is guaranteed to source 10 mA output \ndrive current, but consumes only 50 μA internally. If higher resolution is required, the AD7392 can be used with \ntwo additional bits of data inserted into the software coding, which results in a 2.5 mV LSB step size. \nTable 8  shows examples \nof nominal output voltages (V O) provided by the bipolar \noperation circuit application. \n01121-033VOC\nVREF\nGND+5V\nOP196+5V\n–5VBIPOLAR\nOUTPUT\nSWING\n–5VAD7393\nNOTES\n1.
