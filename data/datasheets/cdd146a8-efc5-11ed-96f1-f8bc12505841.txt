Product profile\n1.1 General description\nThe IP4786CZ32 is designed to protect Hi gh-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) \ntransmitter host interfaces. It includes HDMI 5 V overcurrent / overvoltage protection, \nDisplay Data Channel (DDC) buffering and decoupling, hot plug detect, backdrive \nprotection, Consumer Electronic Control (CEC) buffering and decoupling, and \uf0b112 kV \ncontact ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) protection for all I/Os, exceeding the \nIEC 61000-4-2 level 4 standard.\nThe IP4786CZ32 incorporates Transmission Line Clamping (TLC) technology on the \nhigh-speed Transition Minimized Differential Si gnaling (TMDS) lines to simplify routing \nand help reduce impedance discontinuities . All TMDS lines are protected by an \nimpedance-matched diode configuration that minimizes impedance discontinuities caused \nby typical shunt diodes.\nThe enhanced 60 mA overcurrent / overvoltage linear regulator guarantees \nHDMI-compliant 5 V output voltage levels with up to 6.5 V inputs.\nThe DDC lines use a new buffering concept whic h decouples the internal capacitive load \nfrom the external capacitive load for use with standard Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) or Low Voltage Transistor-Transistor Logic (LVTTL) I/O cells \ndown to 1.8 V. This buffering also redrives  the DDC and CEC signals, allowing the use of \nlonger or cheaper HDMI cables with a higher capacitance. The internal hot plug detect \nmodule simplifies the application of the HDMI transmitter to control the hot plug signal.\nAll lines provide appropriate integrated pu ll-ups and pull-downs fo r HDMI compliance and \nbackdrive protection to guarantee that HDMI interface signals are not pulled down if the \nsystem is powered down or enters Standby mode. Only a single external capacitor is \nrequired for operation.\n1.2 Features and benefits\n\uf06eHDMI 2.0 and all backward compatible standards are supported\n\uf06e6.0 Gbps TMDS Bit Rate (600 Mc sc TMDS Character Rate) compatible\n\uf06eSupports UHD 4k (2160p) 60 Hz display modes\n\uf06eImpedance matched 100 \uf057 differential transmission line ESD protection for \nTMDS lines ( \uf0b110\uf057).

Application information\n9.1 TMDS ESD\nTo protect the TMDS lines and also to comp ly with the impedance requirements of the \nHDMI specification, the IP4786CZ32 pr ovides ESD protection with matched \nTLC ESD structures. Typical Dual Rail Clamp (DRC) or rail-to-rail shunt structures are \ncommon for low-capacitance ESD protection (as shown on the left side of Figure 20 ) \nwhere the dominant factor for the TMDS line impedance dip is determined by the capacitive load to ground. Parasitic lead inductances of the packaging in this case works against the ESD clamping pe rformance by including the \uf044I/\uf044t reactance of the inductance \ninto the path of the ESD shunt.\nThe IP4786CZ32 utilizes these inhe rent inductances in series with the transmission line in \norder to present an effective capacitive load of roughly only 0.7 pF. This TLC structure \nminimizes the capacitive dip, for ideal signal integrity ( Figure 20\n; right side) without \ncomplicated PCB pre-compensation. As a be neficial side effect, this enhances the \nESD performance of the device as well, sinc e the reactance of the series inductance \nattenuates the fast initial peak of the ESD pul se, for a lower residual pulse delivered to the \nApplication Specific In tegrated Circuit (ASIC).\n \na.

The \ncapacitive decoupling ensures that the maximu m capacitive load is well within the 50 pF \nmaximum of the HDMI specific ation. No external pull-ups or pull-downs are required.\nThe bidirectional buffers support high-capacit ive load on the HDMI cable-side. Various \nnon-compliant but prevalent low-cost cables ha ve been observed with a capacitive load of \nup to 6 nF on the DDC lines, far exceeding the 700 pF HDMI limit. The IP4786CZ32 can \neasily decouple this from the weaker AS IC I/O buffers, and drive the rogue cable \nsuccessfully.\n \n a. DDC clock b. DDC data\nFig 21.

This allows extensive system po wer management configurations and \nguarantees an HDMI-compliant V (CEC_CON)  on the connector, as well as the \nbackdrive-protected 125 \uf06dA nominal CEC pull-up which does not degrade the bus when \npowered down.\nBy placing the CEC microcontroller and V CC(5V0)  input on a 5 V rail as shown in Figure 28 , \nthe CEC microcontroller can communicate over CEC for power commands, and then \nenable the HDMI port via the CEC_STBY pin, as well as the rest of the system as needed.\nIf IP4786CZ32 Standby modes are not required, or if the Power-down modes are not \ndesired, the CEC_STBY pin can be pulled HIGH to V CC(5V0)  or V CC(SYS)  for continuous \nHDMI and CEC operation.\nStrapping the CEC_STBY = V CC(SYS) =VDD of ASIC guarantees that all interface signals \nending with the suffix “_SYS” on the system side will be disabled when V CC(SYS)  goes low, \nprotecting the ASIC I/O signal s from exceedin g its local V DD. In this mode, even if V CC(5V0)  \nis powered, HDMI_5V0_CON go active and hot plug events can be detected only when \nthe ASIC power supply rail is on.\nStrapping CEC_STBY = V CC(5V0)  is the most basic configuration where the buffers are \nenabled whenever the local V CC(5V0)  and V CC(SYS)  supplies reach minimum operating \nlevels.Fig 24.

The IP4786CZ32 prevents this backdrive condition \nwhenever the I/O voltage is greater than the local supply.\n Fig 25.

This means, for example, a cost-reduced 5.2 V \uf0b15 % or even \na5 . 5V\uf0b110 % supply can be used with the IP4786CZ32.\nAs with all the I/O pins, this block is ESD-protected and also provides backdrive protection when a rogue HDMI sink powers  the HDMI cable unexpectedly.\n \nFig 27. 5 V LDO with overcurrent / overvoltage protectionESD_BYPASS\nHDMI_5V0_CON\n018aaa110DDC/HPD\nbuffers60 mA\novercurrent\ncontrolCEC \n3V3 \nregulator\nCEC\nbufferVCC(5V0)\nIP4786CZ32 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2014.

These lines rely on ti ghtly controlled microstrip or stripline transmission lines \nwith minimal impedance discontinuities, which can deteriorate return loss, increase deterministic jitter and generally erode overall link signal integrity.\nNormally when designing the PCB with standard shunt ESD clamps, careful consideration \nmust be given to manual pre-compensat ion of the additional load of the added \nESD component. With the IP4786CZ32 TLCs, the ESD suppressor is designed to \nmaintain the characteristic impedance of the PCB microstrip or stripline, and therefore the \ndesigner needs only be concerned with t he standard-controlled impedance of the \nunloaded PCB lines. This simplifies the task of the PCB designer, and minimizes the tuning cycles, which are sometimes required when pre-compensation misses the mark. A basic application diagram for the ESD protection of an HDMI interface is shown in \nFigure 29\n and Figure 30  for type-A and type-D HDMI connector versions.\nThe optimized HVQFN32 pinning simplifies the PCB design to keep the ESD protection \nclose to the connector where it can minimi ze the coupling of the ESD pulse onto other \nlines in the system during a strike.\nDue to the integrated pull-up and pull-down resistors, only two external capacitors are \nrequired to implement a fully compliant HDMI port.\n \nFig 29.

Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n11.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n11.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n11.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhe sive and flux, clinching of leads, board \ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are \nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\nIP4786CZ32 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2014. All rights reserved.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 5 — 24 June 2014 31 of 36NXP Semiconductors IP4786CZ32\nDVI and HDMI interface ESD and overcurrent protection\n11.4 Reflow soldering\nKey characteristics in reflow soldering are:\n•Lead-free versus SnPb solderi ng; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to \nhigher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 32 ) than a SnPb process, thus \nreducing the process window\n•Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process \nwindow for a mix of large and small components on one board\n•Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is \nheated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 11  and 12\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 32 .Table 11.
