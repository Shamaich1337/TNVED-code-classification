### Component Summary: LFCN-800+

**Type:** Low Pass Filter (Ceramic)

**Description:**  
The LFCN-800+ is a ceramic low pass filter designed for RF applications. It operates within a frequency range of DC to 800 MHz, providing excellent performance in terms of insertion loss and power handling. The filter is constructed using LTCC (Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic) technology, which enhances its temperature stability and reliability.

### Key Specifications:

- **Voltage Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; however, the RF power input is rated at 9W max at 25°C.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified; current handling is typically inferred from power ratings.
- **Power Consumption:** 9W maximum RF input power at 25°C.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type:** FV1206 (small size).
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided data.
- **Special Features:**
  - Excellent power handling capability.
  - Small size and compact design.
  - Temperature stable performance.
  - Five-section filter design for enhanced performance.
  - RoHS compliant.

### Typical Applications:
- **Harmonic Rejection:** Used in applications where it is essential to suppress unwanted harmonic frequencies.
- **VHF/UHF Transmitters/Receivers:** Ideal for use in communication systems operating in the VHF and UHF bands.
- **Laboratory Use:** Suitable for experimental setups requiring precise filtering of RF signals.

### Additional Notes:
- The LFCN-800+ is designed to provide a low insertion loss of 1.3 dB across its passband (DC to 800 MHz) and has a cut-off frequency at 990 MHz with a rejection loss of 3.0 dB.
- The filter features a low VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio) of 1.2:1 across the passband, indicating good impedance matching.
- For applications requiring DC isolation, coupling capacitors are recommended to avoid DC leakage. Alternatively, a version with DC pass capability is available.

This summary encapsulates the essential characteristics and applications of the LFCN-800+ low pass filter, making it a valuable component for RF design and engineering tasks.
