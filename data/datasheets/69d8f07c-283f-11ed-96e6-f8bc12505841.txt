It        \nfeatures one silicon pedestal embedded in a low \nloss, low dispersion glass which supports the      \nbeamGleads. The diode is formed on the top of the \npedestal, and airGbridges connect the diode to the \nbeamGleads. The topside is fully encapsulated with \nsilicon nitride and also has an additional polymer \nlayer for scratch and impact protection. These      \nprotective coatings prevent damage to the diode \njunction and airGbridge during handling and          \nassembly. The diodes exhibit low series resistance,  \nlow capacitance, and extremely fast switching speed . \n  \nApplications \n \nThe ultra low capacitance, low RC product and low \nprofile of the MA4PBL027 makes it an ideal choice \nfor use in microwave and millimeter wave switch  \ndesigns, where low insertion loss and high isolatio n \nare required. The low bias levels of 10 mA in the l ow \nloss state and 0 V in the isolation state allows th e \nuse of a simple 5 V TTL gate driver. These  diodes \ncan be  used as switching arrays on radar systems, \nhigh speed ECM circuits, optical switching networks , \ninstrumentation, and other wideband multiGthrow \nswitch assemblies.
