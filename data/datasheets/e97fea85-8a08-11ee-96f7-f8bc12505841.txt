The device is capable of supplying 250mA of output current with a dropout voltage of 400mV. Designed for use in battery-powered or high voltage systems, the low quiescent current (65μA operating and 1μA in shutdown) makes the L T3013 an ideal choice. Quiescent current is also well controlled in dropout.\nOther features of the L T3013 include a PWRGD ﬂ  ag to \nindicate output regulation. The delay between regulated output level and ﬂ  ag indication is programmable with \na single capacitor. The L T3013 also has the ability to operate with very small output capacitors. The regulator is stable with only 3.3μF on the output while most older devices require between 10μF and 100μF for stability. Small ceramic capacitors can be used without any need for series resistance (ESR) as is common with other regulators. Internal protection circuitry includes reverse-battery protection, current limiting, thermal limiting and reverse current protection. \nThe device is available with an adjustable output with a \n1.24V reference voltage. The L T3013 regulator  is available in the thermally enhanced 16-lead TSSOP and the low proﬁ  le (0.75mm), 12-pin (4mm × 3mm) DFN package, \nboth providing excellent thermal characteristics.\n , LT, LTC and LTM are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation. \nAll other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings \nmay cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2:  The L T3013 is tested and speciﬁ  ed for these conditions with the \nADJ pin connected to the OUT pin.\nNote 3:  Operating conditions are limited by maximum junction \ntemperature. The regulated output voltage speciﬁ  cation will not apply for all possible combinations of input voltage and output current. When operating at maximum input voltage, the output current range must be limited. When operating at maximum output current, the input voltage  range must be limited.\nNote 4:  To satisfy requirements for minimum input voltage, the L T3013 is \ntested and speciﬁ  ed for these conditions with an external resistor divider (249k bottom, 649k top) for an output voltage of 4.5V. The external resistor divider will add a 5μA DC load on the output.\nNote 5:  Dropout voltage is the minimum input to output voltage differential \nneeded to maintain regulation at a speciﬁ  ed output current. In dropout, the output voltage will be equal to (V\nIN – V DROPOUT ).\nNote 6:  GND pin current is tested with V IN = 4.75V and a current source \nload. This means the device is tested while operating close to its dropout region. This is the worst-case GND pin current. The GND pin current will decrease slightly at higher input voltages.Note 7:  ADJ pin bias current ﬂ  ows into the ADJ pin.\nNote 8:  SHDN  pin current ﬂ  ows out of the SHDN  pin.\nNote 9:  Reverse output current is tested with the IN pin grounded and the \nOUT pin forced to the rated output voltage. This current ﬂ  ows into the OUT pin and out the GND pin.\nNote 10:  The L T3013E is guaranteed to meet performance speciﬁ  cations \nfrom 0°C to 125°C operating junction temperature. Speciﬁ  cations over the –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by design, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls.The L T3013H is tested to the L T3013H Electrical Characteristics table at 140°C operating junction temperature. High junction temperatures degrade operating lifetimes. Operating lifetime is derated at junction temperatures greater than 125°C. The L T3013MP is 100% tested and guaranteed over the –55°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range.\nNote 11:  This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended \nto protect the device during momentary overload conditions. Junction temperature will exceed 125°C (L T3013E, L T3013MP) or 140°C (L T3013H) when overtemperature protection is active. Continuous operation above the speciﬁ  ed maximum operating junction temperature may impair device reliability.ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nThe l denotes the speciﬁ  cations which apply over the –40°C

FUNCTIONS\nNC (Pins 1, 9, 12)/(Pins 2, 12, 15):  No Connect. These \npins have no internal connection; connecting NC pins to a copper area for heat dissipation provides a small improvement in thermal performance.\nOUT (Pins 2, 3)/(Pins 3, 4):  Output. The output supplies \npower to the load. A minimum output capacitor of 3.3μF is required to prevent oscillations. Larger output capacitors will be required for applications with large transient loads to limit peak voltage transients. See the Applications Information section for more information on output capacitance and reverse output characteristics.\nADJ (Pin 4)/(Pin 5):  Adjust. This is the input to the error \nampliﬁ  er. This pin is internally clamped to ±7V. It has a bias current of 30nA which ﬂ  ows into the pin (see curve \nof ADJ Pin Bias Current vs Temperature in the Typical Performance Characteristics). The ADJ pin voltage is 1.24V referenced to ground, and the output voltage range is 1.24V to 60V.\nGND (Pins 5, 13)/(Pins 1, 6, 8, 9, 16, 17):  Ground. The \nexposed backside of the package is an electrical connection for GND. As such, to ensure optimum device operation and thermal performance, the exposed pad must be connected directly to Pin 5/Pin 6 on the PC board.\nPWRGD (Pin 6)/(Pin 7):  Power Good. The PWRGD ﬂ  ag is \nan open collector ﬂ  ag to indicate that the output voltage \nhas come up to above 90% of the nominal output voltage. There is no internal pull-up on this pin; a pull-up resistor must be used. The PWRGD pin will change state from an open-collector to high impedance after both the output is above 90% of the nominal voltage and the capacitor on the CT pin has charged through a 1.6V differential. The maximum pull-down current of the PWRGD pin in the low state is 50μA.SHDN  (Pin 8)/(Pin 11):  Shutdown. The SHDN  pin is used \nto put the L T3013 into a low power shutdown state. The output will be off when the SHDN  pin is pulled low. The  \nSHDN  pin can be driven either by 5V logic or open-collector \nlogic with a pull-up resistor. The pull-up resistor is only required to supply the pull-up current of the open-collector gate, normally several microamperes. If unused, the SHDN  \npin must be tied to a logic high or V\nIN.\nCT (Pin 7)/(Pin 10):  Timing Capacitor. The C T pin allows \nthe use of a small capacitor to delay the timing between the point where the output crosses the PWRGD threshold and the PWRGD ﬂ  ag changes to a high impedance state. \nCurrent out of this pin during the charging phase is 3μA. The voltage difference between the PWRGD low and PWRGD high states is 1.6V (see the Applications Information Section).\nIN (Pins 10, 11)/(Pins 13,14):  Input. Power is supplied \nto the device through the IN pin. A bypass capacitor is required on this pin if the device is more than six inches away from the main input ﬁ  lter capacitor. In general, the \noutput impedance of a battery rises with frequency, so it is advisable to include a bypass capacitor in battery-powered circuits. A bypass capacitor in the range of 1μF to 10μF is sufﬁ  cient. The L T3013 is designed to withstand reverse voltages on the IN pin with respect to ground and the OUT pin. In the case of a reversed input, which can happen if a battery is plugged in backwards, the L T3013 will act as if there is a diode in series with its input. There will be no reverse current ﬂ  ow into the L T3013 and no reverse \nvoltage will appear at the load. The device will protect both itself and the load.(DFN Package)/(TSSOP Package)\nLT3013\n123013feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nVIN\n3013 F01VOUT\nR2\nR1+R2\nR1VOUT = 1.24V\nVADJ = 1.24V\nIADJ = 30nA AT 25°C\nOUTPUT RANGE = 1.24V TO 60V+ (IADJ)(R2) 1 +IN\nLT3013OUT\nADJ\nGND\nFigure 1. Adjustable OperationThe L T3013 is a 250mA high voltage low dropout regula-\ntor with micropower quiescent current and shutdown. The device is capable of supplying 250mA at a dropout voltage of 400mV. The low operating quiescent current (65μA) drops to 1μA in shutdown. In addition to the low quiescent current, the L T3013 incorporates several protection features which make it ideal for use in bat-tery-powered systems. The device is protected against both reverse input and reverse output voltages. In battery backup applications where the output can be held up by a backup battery when the input is pulled to ground, the L T3013 acts like it has a diode in series with its output and prevents reverse current ﬂ  ow.\nAdjustable Operation\nThe L T3013 has an output voltage range of 1.24V to 60V. \nThe output voltage is set by the ratio of two external resistors as shown in Figure 1. The device servos the output to maintain the voltage at the adjust pin at 1.24V referenced to ground. The current in R1 is then equal to 1.24V/R1 and the current in R2 is the current in R1 plus the ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ pin bias current, 30nA at 25°C, ﬂ  ows through R2 into the ADJ pin. The output \nvoltage can be calculated using the formula in Figure 1. The value of R1 should be less than 250k to minimize errors in the output voltage caused by the ADJ pin bias current.Note that in shutdown the output is turned off and the \ndivider current will be zero. \nThe adjustable device is tested and speciﬁ  ed with the \nADJ pin tied to the OUT pin and a 5μA DC load (unless otherwise speciﬁ  ed) for an output voltage of 1.24V. Speci-ﬁ  cations for output voltages greater than 1.24V will be proportional to the ratio of the desired output voltage to 1.24V; (V\nOUT/1.24V). For example, load regulation for an \noutput current change of 1mA to 250mA is –7mV typical atV\nOUT = 1.24V. At V OUT = 12V, load regulation is:\n (12V/1.24V) • (–7mV) = –68mV\nOutput Capacitance and T ransient Response\nThe L T3013 is designed to be stable with a wide range of \noutput capacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor affects stability, most notably with small capacitors. A minimum output capacitor of 3.3μF with an ESR of 3Ω or less is recommended to prevent oscillations. The L T3013 is a micropower device and output transient response will be a function of output capacitance. Larger values of output capacitance decrease the peak deviations and provide improved transient response for larger load current changes. Bypass capacitors, used to decouple individual components powered by the L T3013, will increase the effective output capacitor value.\nLT3013\n133013feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic \ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across temperature and applied voltage. The most common dielectrics used are speciﬁ  ed with EIA temperature characteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V, X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics are good for providing high capacitances in a small package, but they tend to have strong voltage and temperature coefﬁ  cients as shown in Figures 2 and 3. When used with a 5V regulator, a 16V 10μF Y5V capacitor can exhibit an effective value as low as 1μF to 2μF for the DC bias voltage applied and over the operating temperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in more stable characteristics and are more suitable for use as the output capacitor. The X7R type has better stability across temperature, while the X5R is less expensive and is available in higher values. Care still must be exercised when using X5R and X7R capacitors; the X5R and X7R codes only specify operating temperature range and maximum capacitance change over temperature. Capacitance change due to DC bias with X5R and X7R capacitors is better than Y5V and Z5U capacitors, but can still be signiﬁ  cant enough \nto drop capacitor values below appropriate levels. Capacitor DC bias characteristics tend to improve as component case size increases, but expected capacitance at operating voltage should be veriﬁ  ed.Voltage and temperature coefﬁ  cients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a piezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates voltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, simi-lar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or microphone works. For a ceramic capacitor the stress can be induced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients.\nPWRGD Flag and Timing Capacitor Delay\nThe PWRGD ﬂ  ag is used to indicate that the ADJ pin volt-\nage is within 10% of the regulated voltage. The PWRGD pin is an open-collector output, capable of sinking 50μA of current when the ADJ pin voltage is low. There is no internal pull-up on the PWRGD pin; an external pull-up resistor must be used. When the ADJ pin rises to within 10% of its ﬁ  nal reference value, a delay timer is started. \nAt the end of this delay, programmed by the value of the capacitor on the C\nT pin, the PWRGD pin switches to a high \nimpedance and is pulled up to a logic level by an external pull-up resistor.\nTo calculate the capacitor value on the C\nT pin, use the \nfollowing formula:\n  CIt\nVVTIMECT DELAY\nCT HIGH CT LOW=\x81\n– () ( )\nDC BIAS VOLTAGE (V)CHANGE IN VALUE (%)\n3013 F0220\n0\n–20–40–60–80\n–100\n0 4 8 10 26 12 14X5R\nY5V\n16BOTH CAPACITORS ARE 16V,\n1210 CASE SIZE, 10μF\nTEMPERATURE (°C)–5040\n20\n0\n–20–40–60–80\n–100\n25 75\n3013 F03–25 0 50 100 125Y5VCHANGE IN VALUE (%)X5R\nBOTH CAPACITORS ARE 16V,\n1210 CASE SIZE, 10μF\nFigure 2. Ceramic Capacitor DC Bias Characteristics Figure 3. Ceramic Capacitor Temperature Characteristics\nLT3013\n143013feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 4 shows a block diagram of the PWRGD circuit. At \nstartup, the timing capacitor is discharged and the PWRGD pin will be held low. As the output voltage increases and the ADJ pin crosses the 90% threshold, the JK ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  op \nis reset, and the 3μA current source begins to charge the timing capacitor. Once the voltage on the C\nT pin reaches \nthe V CT(HIGH)  threshold (approximately 1.7V at 25°C), the \ncapacitor voltage is clamped and the PWRGD pin is set to a high impedance state.\nDuring normal operation, an internal glitch ﬁ  lter will ignore \nshort transients (<15μs). Longer transients below the 90% threshold will reset the JK ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  op. This ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  op ensures \nthat the capacitor on the C\nT pin is quickly discharged all \nthe way to the V CT(LOW)  threshold before re-starting the \ntime delay. This provides a consistent time delay after the ADJ pin is within 10% of the regulated voltage before the PWRGD pin switches to high impedance.Thermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device will be limited \nby the maximum rated junction temperature (125°C for L T3013E, L T3013MP or 140°C for L T3013HFE). The power dissipated by the device will be made up of two components:\n1. Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage   \n differential: I\nOUT • (V IN – V OUT) and,\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage: \n IGND • VIN.\nThe GND pin current can be found by examining the GND Pin \nCurrent curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics. Power dissipation will be equal to the sum of the two components listed above.\nThe L T3013 has internal thermal limiting designed \nto protect the device during overload conditions. For continuous normal conditions the maximum junction temperature rating of 125°C (E-grade, MP-grade) or 140°C (H-grade)must not be exceeded. It is important to give careful consideration to all sources of thermal resistance from junction to ambient. Additional heat sources mounted nearby must also be considered.\nQJ\nKVREF • 90%ADJ\nVCT(LOW)\n~0.1VVCT(HIGH)  – VBE\n(~1.1V)ICT 3μA\nCT\n3013 F04\n–+–+PWRGD\nFigure 4.

Copper board stiffeners and plated through-holes can also be used to spread the heat generated by power devices.\nThe following tables list thermal resistance for several \ndifferent board sizes and copper areas. All measurements were taken in still air on 3/32” FR-4 board with one ounce copper.\nTable 1.

Transient operation at high input/output differentials is possible. The approximate thermal time constant for a 2500sq mm 3/32” FR-4 board with maximum topside and backside area for one ounce copper is three seconds. This time constant will increase as more thermal mass is added (i.e., vias, larger board, and other components).\nFor an application with transient high power peaks, average \npower dissipation can be used for junction temperature calculations if the pulse period is signiﬁ  cantly less than \nthe thermal time constant of the device and board.Calculating Junction Temperature\nExample 1: Given an output voltage of 5V, an input voltage \nrange of 8V to 12V, an output current range of 0mA to 250mA, and a maximum ambient temperature of 30°C, what will the maximum junction temperature be?\nThe power dissipated by the device will be equal to: I\nOUT(MAX)  • (V IN(MAX)  – V OUT) + (I GND • VIN(MAX) )\nwhere: I\nOUT(MAX)  = 250mA\n V IN(MAX)  = 12V\n IGND at (I OUT = 250mA, V IN = 12V) = 8mA\nSo: P = 250mA • (12V – 5V) + (8mA • 12V) = 1.85WThe thermal resistance will be in the range of 40°C/W to \n62°C/W depending on the copper area. So the junction temperature rise above ambient will be approximately equal to:\n 1.85W • 50°C/W = 92.3°CThe maximum junction temperature will then be equal to \nthe maximum junction temperature rise above ambient plus the maximum ambient temperature or:\n T\nJMAX = 30°C + 92.3°C = 122.3°C\nExample 2: Given an output voltage of 5V, an input voltage \nof 48V that rises to 72V for 5ms(max) out of every 100ms, and a 5mA load that steps to 200mA for 50ms out of every 250ms, what is the junction temperature rise aboveambient? Using a 500ms period (well under the time constant of the board), power dissipation is as follows:\n P1(48V in, 5mA load) = 5mA • (48V – 5V)\n  + (200μA • 48V) = 0.23W\n P2(48V in, 50mA load) = 200mA • (48V – 5V) \n  + (8mA • 48V) = 8.98W\n P3(72V in, 5mA load) = 5mA • (72V – 5V)\n  + (200μA • 72V) = 0.35W\n P4(72V in, 50mA load) = 200mA • (72V – 5V)\n  + (8mA • 72V) = 13.98W\nLT3013\n163013feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOperation at the different power levels is as follows:\n 76% operation at P1, 19% for P2, 4% for P3, and\n  1% for P4.\n P EFF = 76%(0.23W) + 19%(8.98W) + 4%(0.35W)\n + 1%(13.98W) = 2.03W\nWith a thermal resistance in the range of 40°C/W to \n62°C/W , this translates to a junction temperature rise above ambient of 81°C to 125°C.\nHigh Temperature OperationCare must be taken when designing L T3013 applications to \noperate at high ambient temperatures. The L T3013 works at elevated temperatures but erratic operation can occur due to unforeseen variations in external components. Some tantalum capacitors are available for high temperature operation, but ESR is often several ohms; capacitor ESR above 3Ω is unsuitable for use with the L T3013. Ceramic \ncapacitor manufacturers (Murata, AVX, TDK, and Vishay Vitramon at this writing) now offer ceramic capacitors that are rated to 150°C using an X8R dielectric. Device instability will occur if output capacitor value and ESR are outside design limits at elevated temperature and operating DC voltage bias (see information on capacitor characteristics under Output Capacitance and Transient Response). Check each passive component for absolute value and voltage ratings over the operating temperature range.\nLeakages in capacitors or from solder ﬂ  ux left after \ninsufficient board cleaning adversely affects low quiescent current operation.  The output voltage resistor \ndivider should use a maximum bottom resistor value of 124k to compensate for high temperature leakage, setting divider current to 10μA. Consider junction temperature increase due to power dissipation in both the junction and nearby components to ensure maximum speciﬁ  cations are \nnot violated for the device or external components.Protection Features\nThe L T3013 incorporates several protection features which \nmake it ideal for use in battery-powered circuits. In ad-dition to the normal protection features associated with monolithic regulators, such as current limiting and thermal limiting, the device is protected against reverse-input volt-ages, and reverse voltages from output to input.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nare intended to protect the device against current overload conditions at the output of the device. For normal opera-tion, the junction temperature should not exceed 125°C (L T3013E, L T3013MP) or 140°C (L T3013HFE).\nLike many IC power regulators, the L T3013 has safe oper-\nating area protection. The safe area protection decreases the current limit as input voltage increases and keeps the power transistor inside a safe operating region for all values of input voltage. The protection is designed to provide some output current at all values of input voltage up to the device breakdown. The SOA protection circuitry for the L T3013 uses a current generated when the input voltage exceeds 25V to decrease current limit. This cur-rent shows up as additional quiescent current for input voltages above 25V. This increase in quiescent current occurs both in normal operation and in shutdown (see curve of Quiescent Current in the Typical Performance Characteristics).\nThe input of the device will withstand reverse voltages of \n80V. No negative voltage will appear at the output. The device will protect both itself and the load. This provides protection against batteries which can be plugged in backward.\nThe ADJ pin of the device can be pulled above or below \nground by as much as 7V without damaging the device. If the input is left open-circuit or grounded, the ADJ pin will act like an open-circuit when pulled below ground, and like a large resistor (typically 100k) in series with a diode when pulled above ground. If the input is powered by a voltage source, pulling the ADJ pin below the refer-ence voltage will cause the device to current limit. This will cause the output to go to a unregulated high voltage. Pulling the ADJ pin above the reference voltage will turn off all output current. \nLT3013\n173013feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIn situations where the ADJ pin is connected to a resistor \ndivider that would pull the ADJ pin above its 7V clamp voltage if the output is pulled high, the ADJ pin input current must be limited to less than 5mA. For example, a resistor divider is used to provide a regulated 1.5V output from the 1.24V reference when the output is forced to 60V. The top resistor of the resistor divider must be chosen to limit the current into the ADJ pin to less than 5mA when the ADJ pin is at 7V. The 53V difference between the OUT and ADJ pins divided by the 5mA maximum current into the ADJ pin yields a minimum top resistor value of 10.6k.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several \ndifferent input/output conditions can occur. The output voltage may be held up while the input is either pulled to ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage, or is left open-circuit. Current ﬂ  ow back into the output will follow \nthe curve shown in Figure 5. The rise in reverse output current above 7V occurs from the breakdown of the 7V clamp on the ADJ pin. With a resistor divider on the regulator output, this current will be reduced depending on the size of the resistor divider.\nWhen the IN pin of the L T3013 is forced below the OUT \npin or the OUT pin is pulled above the IN pin, input current will typically drop to less than 2μA. This can happen if the input of the L T3013 is connected to a discharged (low voltage) battery and the output is held up by either a backup battery or a second regulator circuit. The state of the SHDN  pin will have no effect on the reverse output \ncurrent when the output is pulled above the input.\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE (V)0REVERSE OUTPUT CURRENT (μA)120160200\n83013 F0580\n40100140180\n60\n20\n0\n2 1 4 3 67 9 5 10ADJ\nPIN CLAMP\n(SEE ABOVE)TJ = 25°C\nVIN = 0V\nVOUT = VADJ\nCURRENT FLOWSINTO OUTPUT PIN\nFigure 5.
