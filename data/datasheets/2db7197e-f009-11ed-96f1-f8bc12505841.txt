As soon as the reset is released, the internal oscillator is started and the programmed I\n2C \naddress and the trim values are read from the internal non volatile memory (NVM) trimming data block. The device enters Standby Mode as soon as the Idle State is reached. \nNote: As long as the I\n2C address has not yet been reached, \nthe device will respond with NACK to any I2C command \nand ignore any request to avoid responding to a wrong I\n2C address.\nStandby Mode\nStandby Mode is the default mode after power-up. In this state, the oscillator, all internal support blocks, and the ADCs are switched off   but I\n2C communication is fully \nsupported.\nAmbient Light Sensor Operation\nALS measurements can be activated by setting the ALS_EN bit to 1 in the MAIN_CTRL register.\nAs soon as the ALS becomes activated through an I\n2C \ncommand, the internal support blocks are powered on. Once the voltages and currents are settled (typically after 5ms), the state machine checks for trigger events from a measurement scheduler to start the ALS conversions according to the selected measurement repeat rates.\nOnce ALS_EN is changed back to 0, a conversation running \non the respective channel will be completed and the relevant ADCs and support blocks will move to standby mode.Start\nFuse Read\nIdle\nWait for OSC Power Up\nCheck ALS\nDo ALS Conversion \n(ADC ms)ALS_EN==0\nALS_EN==1ALS_EN==1\nPriority 1\nPriority 2Ambient Light Sensor Interrupt\nThe ALS interrupt is enabled by ALS_INT_EN=1 and \ncan function as either threshold triggered (ALS_VAR_MODE=0) or variance triggered (ALS_VAR_MODE =1).\nThe ALS threshold interrupt is enabled with ALS_INT_\nEN=1 and ALS_VAR_MODE=0. It is set when the ALS data is above the upper or below the lower ALS threshold for a specifi  ed number of consecutive measurements (1+ALS_\nPERSIST)\nThe ALS variance interrupt is enabled with ALS_INT_EN=1 \nand ALS_VAR_MODE=1. It is set when the absolute value of the diff  erence between previous and current ALS data is \nabove the decoded ALS variance threshold for a specifi  ed \nnumber of consecutive measurements (1+ALS_PERSIST).\n8Register Read (I2CTM Read) \nSSlave Addr\n7 Bit0AAddress \n8 BitASSlave Addr\n7 Bit1AData \n8 BitNP\nSSlave Addr\n7 Bit0AAddress \n8 BitASSlave Addr\n7 Bit1AData \n8-BitAData \n8-BitA…Data \n8-BitNPFrom Master to Slave\nFrom Slave to MasterS\nP\nA\nNStart Condition\nStop Condition\nAcknowledge (ACK)\nNot Acknowledge (NACK)Read Write\nRead WriteRegister Block Read (I2CTM Read) I2C Protocol\nInterface and control of the APDS-9306/APDS-9306-065 is \naccomplished through an I2C serial compatible interface \n(standard or fast mode) to a set of registers that provide access to device control functions and output data. The device supports a single slave address of 0X52 hex using 7-bit addressing protocol. (Contact factory for other ad-dressing options).\nI²C Register Read\nThe registers can be read individually or in block read mode. When two or more bytes are read in block read mode, reserved register addresses are skipped and the next valid address is referenced. If the last valid address has been reached, but the master continues with the block read, the address counter in the device will not roll over and the device returns 00HEX for every subsequent byte read.\nThe block read operation is the only way to ensure correct \ndata read out of multi-byte registers and to avoid splitting of results with HIGH and LOW bytes originating from diff erent conversions. During block read access on ALS \nresult registers, the result update is blocked.\nIf a read access is started on an address belonging to a \nnon-readable register, the APDS-9306/APDS-9306-065 will re-turn NACK until the I\n2C™ operation is ended.\nRead operations must follow the Register Read timing \ndiagram as below.I²C Register Write\nThe APDS-9306/APDS-9306-065 registers can be written to individually or in block write mode. When two or more bytes are written in block write mode, reserved registers and read-only registers are skipped. The transmitted data is automatically applied to the next writable register. If a register includes read (R) and read/write (RW) bits, the register is not skipped. Data written to read-only bits are ignored.\nIf the last valid address of the APDS-9306/APDS-9306-\n065 address range is reached but the master attempts to continue the block write operation, the address counter of the APDS-9306/APDS-9306-065 will not roll over. The APDS-9306/APDS-9306-065 will return NACK for every following byte sent by the master until the I\n2C™ operation \nis ended.\nIf a write access is started on an address belonging to a \nnon-writeable register, the APDS-9306/APDS-9306-065 will return NACK until the I\n2C™ operation is ended.\nWrite operations must follow the Register Write timing \ndiagram below.\nSSlave Addr\n7 Bit0 A Address AData \n8-BitAP\nSSlave Addr\n7 Bit0 A Address AData \n8-BitAData \n8-BitA…Data \n8-BitAPWrite\nWriteRegister Write (I2CTM Write)\nRegister Block Write (I2CTM Write)From Master to Slave\nFrom Slave to MasterS\nP\nA\nNStart Condition\nStop Condition\nAcknowledge (ACK)\nNot Acknowledge (NACK)\n9Bus Timing Characteristics\nParameter SymbolStandard\nModeFast\nMode Units\nMaximum SCL Clock Frequency f SCL 100 400 KHz\nMinimum START Condition Hold Time Relative to SCL Edge t DSTA 4 μ s\nMinimum SCL Clock Low Width t LOW 4.7  μs\nMinimum SCL Clock High Width t HIGH 4 μ s\nMinimum START Condition Setup Time Relative to SCL Edge t SUSTA 4.7  μs\nMinimum Data Hold Time on SDA Relative to SCL Edge t HDDAT 0 μ s\nMinimum Data Setup Time on SDA Relative to SCL Edge t SUDAT 0.1 0.1 μs\nMinimum STOP Condition Setup Time on SCL t SUSTO 4 μ s\nMinimum Bus Free Time Between Stop Condition and Start Condition t BUS 4.7  μsSDA\nSCLtLOW\ntHDSTAtBUS tHDSTAtSUDAT\ntSUSTO\ntSUSTAtHIGH\ntHDDATI2C Interface – Bus Timing\n10Register set:\nThe APDS-9306/APDS-9306-065 is controlled and monitored by data registers and a command register accessed through \nthe serial interface.

It allows the AC component of the V DD to pass through to ground. Use \nbypass capacitor with low eff  ective series resistance (ESR) and low eff  ective series inductance (ESI), such as the common \nceramic types, which provide a low impedance path to ground at high frequencies to handle transient currents caused \nby internal logic switching. \nPull-up resistors, RSDA and RSCL, maintain the SDA and SCL lines at a high level when the bus is free and ensure the \nsignals are pulled up from a low to a high level within the required rise time. A pull-up resistor, RINT, is also required for the interrupt (INT), which functions as a wired-AND signal in a similar fashion to the SCL and SDA lines. A typical impedance value of 10 kΩ can be used. \nFor a complete description of I\n2C maximum and minimum R1 and R2 values, please review the I2C Specifi  cation at \nhttp:// www.semiconductors.philips.com.\nMCUSCL\nSDA\nINTAPDS-9306/\nAPDS-9306-065SCL\nSDA\nINTVDD\nRSDA RSCL RINT\nGND1uF\n16Dimensions are in mmPackage Outline Dimensions for APDS-9306\nPCB Pad Layout for APDS-9306\nDimensions are in mmPin-Out\n1 - GND\n2 - NC\n3 - NC\n4 - VDD\n5 - SCL\n6 - SDA\n7 - INT\n8 - NC1 2 3 4567 8876 5\n4 3 2 1(0.263)2 ±0.10\n2 ±0.10\nIC Active Area CenterCL\nCL 0.34 ±0.100.265 ±0.100\n(x4)\n0.775 ±0.100\n(x8)\n0.53 ±0.10\n(x6)0.35 ±0.10\n(x8)\n0.31 ±0.10\n(x8)CL\nCL(0.344)\n(0.407)\n0.310\n(x8)0.350\n(x8)2  2 \n0.775\n(x8)\n0.530\n(x6)0.265\n(x4)CL\nCL\n178+0.300\n-0.1004 ±0.104 ±0.10 2 ±0.050 Ø 1.50 ±0.10\nØ 1 ±0.2501.75 ±0.10\n3.500 ±0.0500.200 ±0.020\n2.250 ±0.050\nSECTION A-A\nSCALE 10 : 145 Deg Max\n2.250 ±0.050 SECTION B-B\nSCALE 10 : 145 Deg Max\nDETAIL C\nSCALE 20 : 1Unit OrientationA\nAB B\nC\nDimensions are in mm\nReel Dimensions for APDS-9306Tape Dimensions for APDS-9306\nØ178 ± 1\n9 ±0.20\n12 ±156 ± 0.20\nR6.50 ±0.10\nR10.50 ±0.101.402 ±0.50\nDETAIL B\nSCALE 2 : 1(420mm MIN)\nTRAILER(40mm MIN)\nEMPTY(620mm MIN)\nLEADER(PARTS MOUNTED)\nB\n18Package Outline Dimensions for APDS-9306-065\nPCB Pad Layout\n0.900\n(x6)\n0.400\n(x6)(2)\n(2)\n0.650\n(x4)1.300\n(x3)123\nPINOUT\n1- SCL\n2- SDA\n3- VDD\n4- INT\n5- NC\n6- GND(0.223)2 ±0.10\n2 ±0.10\nIC Active Area Center0.65 ±0.100.65 ±0.10\n(4x)\n0.625 ±0.100\n(6x)0.75 ±0.15\n(6x)\n0.300 ±0.050\n(6x)4 5 64 5 632 1\nCL\nCLCL\nCL\n0.100±0.050\n(6x)\n19Tape Dimensions for APDS-9306-065\nReel Dimensions for APDS-9306-065 \n13 ± 0.2\nArbor Hole\nW3W1\n∅180  ± 0.50\nDiameter60 ± 0.50\nHub Dia.Access Hole Access HoleT\nTape Start SlotT\nTape Start Slot\nAccess Hole\nMeasured at Outer EdgeW2\nMeasured at HubMeasured at Hub\n20.2 Min.CCD/KEACO\nMADE IN MALAYSIA\nFront View Back View Side View8+\n-0.300\n0.1004±0.104±0.10 2 ±0.050 Ø1.50 ±0.10\nØ1±0.251.75 ±0.10\n3.500 ±0.0500.200 ±0.200\n0.830 ±0.0502.180 ±0.050\nSECTION A-A\nSCALE 10 : 15 Deg Max\nDETAIL C\nSCALE 20 : 1Unit Orientation2.180 ±0.050 SECTION B-B\nSCALE 10 : 15 Deg MaxA\nAB B\nC\nDimensions are in mm\n20Recommended Storage Conditions\nStorage Temperature 10°C to 30°C\nRelative Humidity Below 60% RH\nTime from Unsealing to Soldering\nAfter removal from the bag, the parts should be soldered \nwithin seven days if stored at the recommended storage conditions.

The \uf044T/\uf044time rates or \nduration are detailed in the above table. The temperatures are measured at the component to printed circuit board connections.\nIn process zone P1, the PC board and component pins \nare heated to a temperature of 150°C to activate the fl  ux \nin the solder paste. The temperature ramp up rate, R1, is limited to 3°C per second to allow for even heating of both the PC board and component pins.\nProcess zone P2 should be of suffi   cient time duration (100 \nto 180 seconds) to dry the solder paste. The temperature is raised to a level just below the liquidus point of the solder. \nProcess zone P3 is the solder refl  ow zone. In zone P3, the \ntemperature is quickly raised above the liquidus point of solder to 260°C (500°F) for optimum results. The dwell time above the liquidus point of solder should be between 60 \nand 90 seconds. This is to assure proper coalescing of the solder paste into liquid solder and the formation of good solder connections. Beyond the recommended dwell time the intermetallic growth within the solder connections becomes excessive, resulting in the formation of weak and unreliable connections. The temperature is then rapidly reduced to a point below the solidus temperature of the solder to allow the solder within the connections to freeze solid. \nProcess zone P4 is the cool down after solder freeze. The \ncool down rate, R5, from the liquidus point of the solder to 25°C (77°F) should not exceed 6°C per second maximum. This limitation is necessary to allow the PC board and component pins to change dimensions evenly, putting minimal stresses on the component.\nIt is recommended to perform refl  ow soldering no more \nthan twice.
