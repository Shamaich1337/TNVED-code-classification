In addition to the \nspace savings, the ADuM7440/ ADuM7441/ ADuM7442 offer a \nlower price than 2.5 kV or 5 kV isolators where only functional \nisolation is needed. \nThis family, like many Analog Devices isolators, offers very low \npower consumption, consuming one-tenth to one-sixth the power of comparable isolators at comparable data rates up to 25 Mbps. Despite the low power consumption, all models of the \nADuM7440/ ADuM7441/ ADuM7442 provide low pulse width \ndistortion (<5 ns for C grade). In addition, every model has an \ninput glitch filter to protect against extraneous noise disturbances. \nThe ADuM7440/ ADuM7441/ ADuM7442 isolators provide  \nfour independent isolation channels in a variety of channel \nconfigurations and two data rates (see the Ordering Guide) up to 25 Mbps. All models operate with the supply voltage on either side \nranging from 3.0 V to 5.5 V , providing compatibility with lower \nvoltage systems as well as enabling voltage translation functionality across the isolation barrier. All products also have an output \ndefault high logic state in the absence of the input power.  \n1 Protected by U.S. Patents 5,952,849,  6,873,065 and 7,075,329.

A total of four bypass \ncapacitors should be connected between Pin 1 and Pin 2 for \nV\nDD1A, between Pin 7 and Pin 8 for V DD1B, between Pin 9 and \nPin 10 for V DD2B, and between Pin 15 and Pin 16 for V DD2A. \nSupply V DD1A Pin 1 and V DD1B Pin 7 should be connected \ntogether and supply V DD2B Pin 10 and V DD2A Pin 16 should be \nconnected together. The capacitor values should be between \n0.01 μF and 0.1 μF. The total lead  length between both ends of \nthe capacitor and the power supply pin should not exceed 20 mm.  \nVDD1A\nGND1\nVIA\nVIB\nVIC/VOC\nVID/VOD\nVDD1B\nGND1VDD2A\nGND2\nVOA\nVOB\nVOC/VIC\nVOD/VID\nVDD2B\nGND2\n08340-014 \nFigure 16. Recommended Printed Circuit Board Layout \nIn applications involving high common-mode transients, it is important to minimize board coupling across the isolation barrier. \nFurthermore, users should design the board layout so that any coupling that does occur equally affects all pins on a given component side. Failure to ensure this can cause voltage differentials between pins exceeding the absolute maximum ratings of the device, thereby leading to latch-up or permanent damage. \nSee the AN-1109 Application Note  for board layout guidelines. \nPROPAGATION DELAY-RELATED PARAMETERS \nPropagation delay is a parameter that describes the time it takes \na logic signal to propagate through a component. The input-to-\noutput propagation delay time for a high-to-low transition may \ndiffer from the propagation delay time of a low-to-high transition. \nINPUT (VIx)\nOUTPUT (VOx)tPLH tPHL\n50%50%\n08340-008 \nFigure 17. Propagation Delay Parameters \nPulse width distortion is the maximum difference between \nthese two propagation delay values and an indication of how \naccurately the timing of the input signal is preserved. Channel-to-channel matching refers to the maximum amount \nthe propagation delay differs between channels within a single \nADuM7440/ ADuM7441/ ADuM7442 component.  \nPropagation delay skew refers to the maximum amount the \npropagation delay differs between multiple ADuM7440 / \nADuM7441/ ADuM7442 components operating under the  \nsame conditions. \nDC CORRECTNESS AND MAGNETIC FIELD IMMUNITY \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input cause \nnarrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder using the \ntransformer. The decoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the absence of logic transitions at the input for more than ~1 μs, a periodic set of refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state \nis sent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder \nreceives no internal pulses of more than approximately 5 μs, the input side is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctional, in which case the isolator output is forced to a default high state by the \nwatchdog timer circuit. \nThe magnetic field immunity of the ADuM7440/ ADuM7441/ \nADuM7442 is determined by the changing magnetic field, \nwhich induces a voltage in the transformer’s receiving coil large \nenough to either falsely set or reset the decoder. The following analysis defines the conditions under which this can occur. The 3 V operating condition of the ADuM7440/ ADuM7441/ \nADuM7442 is examined because it represents the most \nsusceptible mode of operation. \nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater \nthan 1.0 V . The decoder has a sensing threshold at about 0.5 V , thus \nestablishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can be \ntolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is given by \nV = (−dβ / dt ) ∑ π  r\nn2; n = 1, 2, … , N  \nwhere: \nβ is magnetic flux density (gauss).  \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm). \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil. \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM7440/ \nADuM7441/ ADuM7442 and an imposed requirement that the \ninduced voltage be, at most, 50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable magnetic field at a given \nfrequency can be calculated. The result is shown in Figure 18.  \nData Sheet ADuM7440/ADuM7441/ADuM7442  \n \nRev.

Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density  \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum allowable magnetic field of 0.5 kgauss induces a voltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the sensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. Similarly, if such an event occurred during a transmitted pulse \n(and was of the worst -case polarity), it would reduce the \nreceived pulse from >1.0  V to 0.75  V , still well above the 0.5 V \nsensing threshold of the decoder. \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values cor respond to \nspecific current magnitudes at given distances from the \nADuM7440/ ADuM7441/ ADuM7442 transformers. Figure 19 \nshows these allowable current magnitudes as a function of \nfrequency for select ed distances. As shown, the ADuM7440/ \nADuM7441/ ADuM7442 are extremely immune and can be \naffected only by extremely large currents operated at high \nfrequency very close to the component. For the 1 MHz example \nnoted previously, a 1.2 kA current would have to be placed \n5 mm away from the ADuM7440/ ADuM7441/ ADuM7442 to \naffect the operation of the component.  \n1000\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.011k 100M 10kMAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)\n100k 1M 10M\nMAGNETICFIELDFREQUENCY(Hz)DISTANC E=5mm\nDISTANC E=100m m\nDISTANC E=1m\n08340-010 \nFigure 19. Maximum Allowable Current for Various  \nCurrent -to-ADuM7440 /ADuM7441 /ADuM7442  Spacings  \nNote that at combinations of strong magnetic field and high \nfrequency, any loops formed by printed circuit board traces can \ninduce erro r voltages sufficiently large enough to trigger the \nthresholds of succeeding circuitry. Take care  in the layout of \nsuch traces to avoid this possibility.  POWER CONSUMPTION  \nThe supply current at a given channel of the ADuM7440/ \nADuM7441/ ADuM7442 isolator is a function of the supply \nvoltage, the data ra te of the channel, and the output load of the \nchannel.  \nFor each input channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDI = I DDI (Q) f ≤ 0.5 f r \nIDDI = IDDI (D)  × (2f − fr) + I DDI (Q) f > 0.5 f r \nFor each output channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDO = I DDO (Q) f ≤ 0.5 f r \nIDDO = (IDDO (D) + (0.5 × 10−3) × CL × V DDO) × (2 f − f r) + I DDO (Q) \n f > 0.5 f r \nwhere:  \nIDDI (D) , IDDO (D)  are the input and output dynamic supply currents \nper channel (mA/Mbps).  \nCL is the output load capacitance (pF).  \nVDDO is the output supply voltage (V).  \nf is the input logic signal frequency (MHz); it is half the input \ndata rate, expressed in Mbps.  \nfr is the input stage refresh rate (Mbps).  \nIDDI (Q) , IDDO (Q)  are the specified input and output quiescent  \nsupply currents ( mA).  \nTo calculate the total V DD1 and V DD2 supply current, the supply \ncurrents for each input and output channel corresponding to \nVDD1 and V DD2 are calculated and totaled. Figure 8 and Figure 9 \nshow per -channel supply currents as a function of data rate for \nan unloaded output condition. Figure 10 shows the per -channel \nsupply current as a function of data rate for a 15  pF output \ncondition. Figure 11 through Figure 15 show the total V DD1 and \nVDD2 supply current as a function of data rate for ADuM7440/ \nADuM7441/ ADuM7442 channel configurations.  \nINSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected \nto voltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of \ninsulation degradation is dependent on the characteristics of the \nvoltage waveform applied across the insulation. In addition to \nthe testing perform ed by the regulatory agencies, Anal og Devices \ncarries out an extensive set of evaluations to determine the \nlifetime of the insulation structure within the ADuM7440/ \nADuM7441/ ADuM7442. \nAnalog Devices performs accelerated life testing using voltage levels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. Acceleration factors for several operating conditions are \ndetermined. These factors allow calculation of the time to \nfailure at the actual working voltage. The values shown in Table  18 summarize the peak voltage for 50 years of service life \nfor a bipolar ac operating condition and the maximum CSA  \napproved working voltages. In many cases, the approved working \nvoltage is higher than 50 -year service life voltage. Operation at \nthese high wo rking voltages can lead to shortened insulation life \nin some cases.  \nADuM7440/ADuM7441/ADuM7442  Data Sheet \n \nRev.

The i Coupler insulation structure \ndegrades at different rates depending on whether the waveform \nis bipol ar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure  20, Figure 21, and Figure  22 \nillustrate these different isolation voltage waveforms.  \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. The goal of a 50-year operating lifetime under the ac bipolar condition \ndetermines the Analog Devices recommended maximum \nworking voltage.  \nIn the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insu lation \nis significantly lower. This allows operation at higher working \nvoltages while still achieving a 50 -year service life. The working \nvoltages listed in Table 18 can be applied while maintaining the \n50-year minimum lifetime provided the voltage conforms to \neither the unipolar ac or dc voltage case. Any cross -insulation \nvoltage waveform that does not c onform to Figure 21 or \nFigure  22 should be tre ated as a bipolar ac waveform, and its \npeak voltage should be limited to the 50 -year lifetime voltage \nvalue listed in Table 18. Note that the voltage presented in Figure 21 is shown as sinusoidal  \nfor illustration purposes only. It is meant to represent any voltage  \nwaveform varying between 0 V and some limiting value. The limiting value can be positive or negativ e, but the voltage cannot \ncross 0 V .  \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n08340-011 \nFigure 20.
