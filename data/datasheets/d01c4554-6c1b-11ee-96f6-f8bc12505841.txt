of a capacitor will not change significantly after extended storage periods, however the \nleakage current will slowly increase.\n• This series should not be stored in high temperatures or where there is a high level of humidity. \n• The suitable storage condition  is +5 to +35°C and less than 75% in relative humidity.\n• Do not  store in damp conditions such as water, saltwater spray or oil spray.\n• Do not store in an environment full of hazardous gas (hydrogen sulphide, sulphurous acid gas, nitrous acid, chlorine gas, \nammonium, etc.)\n• Do not store under exposure to ozone, ultraviolet rays or radiation.\nIf a capacitor has been stored for more than 24 months under these conditions and it shows increased leakage current, \nthen a treatment by voltage application is recommended.\nRe-age Procedure\nApply the rated DC voltage to the capacitor at 105°C for a period of 120 minutes through a 1 kΩ series resistor.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nAll Part Numbers in this datasheet are Reach and RoHS compliant, and Halogen-Free. \nAs an environmentally conscious company, KEMET is working continuously with improvements concerning the environmental \neffects of both our capacitors and their production. In Europe (RoHS Directive) and in some other geographical areas like \nChina, legislation has been put in place to prevent the use of some hazardous materials, such as lead (Pb), in electronic \nequipment. All products in this catalog are produced to help our customers' obligations to guarantee their products and fulfill \nthese legislative requirements. The only material of concern in our products has been lead (Pb), which has been removed \nfrom all designs to fulfill the requirement of containing less than 0.1% of lead in any homogeneous material. KEMET will \nclosely follow any changes in legislation worldwide and makes any necessary changes in its products, whenever needed.\nSome customer segments such as medical, military and automotive electronics may still require the use of Lead in electrode \ncoatings.

The \nleakage current may increase after soldering or reflow soldering. Therefore, verify the suitability for use in circuits sensitive \nto leakage current.\nA general principle is that lower temperature operation results in a longer, useful life of the capacitor. For this reason, it \nshould be ensured that electrolytic capacitors are placed away from heat-emitting components. Adequate space should be \nallowed between components for cooling air to circulate, especially when high ripple current loads are applied. In any case, \nthe maximum rated temperature must not be exceeded.\n• Do not deform the case of capacitors or use capacitors with a deformed case.\n• Verify that the connections of the capacitors are able to insert on the board without excessive mechanical force. \nExcessive force during insertion, as well as after soldering may cause terminal damage and affect the electrical \nperformance.\n• Ensure electrical insulation between the capacitor case, negative terminal, positive terminal and PCB.\n• If the capacitors require mounting through additional means, the recommended mounting accessories shall be used.\n• Verify the correct polarization of the capacitor on the board.\nKEMET recommends, to ensure that the voltage across each capacitor does not exceed its rated voltage.\nTemperature Stability Characteristics\nStable characteristics in a very low temperature range allows for less circuits in the design.\nDue to a solid polymer electrolyte, Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors feature higher conductivity. This results in a lower \nESR which, coupled with high capacitance allows an aluminum polymer capacitor to replace several standard electrolytic \ncapacitors, reducing the number of components and maximizing board space.\nThe ESR of polymer capacitors is nearly constant within its operating temperature range, while the ESR of a standard \nelectrolytic capacitor noticeably changes with temperature.\n0.010.11101001,000\nTemperature (°C)ESR (Ω)\n−20 0 20 70 105 125 −55Aluminum Electrolytic Conductive Polymer ElectrolyticTemperature Stability Characteristics\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\n10 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • One East Broward Boulevard A4067_A750 • 8/8/2023\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA750 105°CExpected Life Calculation Chart\nExpected life depends on operating temperature according to the following formula:\nL = Lo x 10(To-T)/20\nWhere:\nL:    Expected life\nLo:  Life at maximum permissible operating temperature with rated operating voltage applied (hours)\nT:    Actual operating temperature\nTo:  Maximum permissible operating temperature\nExpected Life (hours)Actual Operating Temperature (ºC)20,000 200,000 2,00085ºC105ºC\n65ºCExpected Life Calculation Chart\nThe effect of derating temperature can be seen in this graph. \nIn this example, the life expectancy of a 2,000 hour Polymer capacitor is significantly greater than that of a 2,000 hour \nstandard electrolytic capacitor.\n6570758085909510010550,000 100,000 150,000 200,000Temperature (ºC)Conductive Polymer ElectrolyticAluminum ElectrolyticCapacitor Life (H)\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\n11 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • One East Broward Boulevard A4067_A750 • 8/8/2023\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA750 105°CStability of ESR across Frequency Range\nDue to a solid polymer electrolyte, the ESR curve of a solid polymer aluminum capacitor, is lower and more stable than that \nof a standard electrolytic capacitor.\n0.010.1110100\nFrequency (Hz)ESR\n10K 100K 1M 10M 0Aluminum Electrolytic Conductive Polymer ElectrolyticStable ESR Values across Frequency\nHigh Resistance to Ripple Current\nAs a result of a lower ESR, solid polymer aluminum capacitors are able to withstand higher ripple currents during \nnormal operation.\n00.511.522.533.54Ripple Current (Arms)\n33 µF/16 V 47 µF/16 V 100 µF/10 V 220 µF/10 VConductive Polymer ElectrolyticAluminum ElectrolyticAllowable Ripple Current (100 kHz 105°C)\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\n12 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • One East Broward Boulevard A4067_A750 • 8/8/2023\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA750 105°CMarking\nNegative \nPolarity\nBlue LineTrademark\nSeries\nRated\nVoltageCapacitanceDate Code*\n(Last 3 Digits)Date Code*\n1st Digits = Rated Voltage\nLetter = Year Code S = 2019\nFinal Digits = Week of the Year 01 = 1st week of the Year to  \n52 = 52nd week of the Year\nYear Code\nS 2019\nT 2020\nU 2021\nV 2022\nW 2023\nX 2024\nY 2025\nZ 2026\nConstruction\nDetailed Cross Section\nMarginRubber Seal\nTerminal TabsLead\nTerminal Tab\nAluminum Can\nAnode Aluminum Foil, \nEtched, Covered with \nAluminum Oxide \n(Second Layer)Cathode Aluminum \nFoil, Etched \n(Fourth Layer)Paper Spacer with Solid \nPolymer Electrolyte \n(First Layer)Paper Spacer with Solid \nPolymer Electrolyte \n(Third Layer)Rubber SealAluminum Can\nLead (+)\nLead (−)\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\n13 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • One East Broward Boulevard A4067_A750 • 8/8/2023\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA750 105°CFlow Soldering (not suitable for SMD parts)\nThe soldering conditions should be within the specified conditions below:\n• Do not dip the capacitors body into the melted solder.\n• Flux should only be applied to the capacitors terminals.\n• Vapour heat transfer systems are not recommended.

Both the \nanode and cathode foils are then interleaved with absorbent \npaper and wound into a cylinder. During the winding process, \naluminum tabs are attached to each foil to provide the \nelectrical contact.\nThe deck, complete with terminals, is attached to the tabs \nand then folded down to rest on top of the winding. The \ncomplete winding is impregnated with a conductive polymer \nelectrolyte before being housed in a suitable container, usually \nan aluminum can, and sealed. Throughout the process, all \nmaterials inside the housing must be maintained at the \nhighest purity and be compatible with the electrolyte.\nEach capacitor is aged and tested before being packed. \nThe purpose of aging is to repair any damage in the oxide \nlayer and thus reduce the leakage current to a very low level. \nAging is normally carried out at the rated temperature of the \ncapacitor and is accomplished by applying voltage to the \ndevice while carefully controlling the supply current. The \nprocess may take several hours to complete. Damage to the \noxide layer can occur due to variety of reasons:\n     • Slitting of the anode foil after forming\n     • Attaching the tabs to the anode foil\n     • Minor mechanical damage caused during winding\n \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\n16 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • One East Broward Boulevard A4067_A750 • 8/8/2023\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA750 105°CProduct Safety\nTHESE NOTES SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PRODUCT DATA SHEET. FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE RATINGS \nAND THE INFORMATION ON THIS SHEET MAY RESUL T IN A SAFETY HAZARD.\nWarning \nWhen potential lethal voltages e.g. 30 VAC (RMS) or 60 VDC are applied to the terminals of this product, the use of a \nhazard warning label is recommended.\n1. Electrolyte\nConductive polymer aluminum solid electrolytic capacitors contain polymers (electrolytes) which can be hazardous.\n1.1 Safety Precautions\nIn the event of gas venting, avoid contact and inhalation. Wash the affected area with hot water. Use rubber gloves to avoid \nskin contact. Any contact with the eyes should be liberally irrigated with water and medical advice sought. \n2. Intrinsic Properties\n2.1 Operating\nDC capacitors are polar devices and will operate safely only if correctly connected. Reversing the connections will result \nin high leakage currents which could subsequently cause short circuit failure and possibly explosion and fire. Correctly \npolarized operation may result in the above failure modes if:\n• The surge voltage is exceeded\n• The ambient temperature is too high\n• Excessive ripple currents are applied\n2.2 Non-Operating\nExcessive torque or soldering heat may affect the performance of the capacitor or damage the sealing. Electric shock may \nresult if capacitors are not discharged.\n3. Disposal\nAluminum electrolytic capacitors are consignable waste under the Special Waste Regulations 1996 (Statutory Instrument \n1996 No 972), which complies with the EC Hazardous Waste Directive – Directive 91/689/EEC. The electrolyte should \ntherefore be treated as a hazardous waste and advice should be sought from the local office of the Environmental Agency \nregarding its disposal. \nDue to the construction of an aluminum electrolytic capacitors, high temperature incineration may cause the component to \nexplode due to build-up of internal pressure. In addition, incineration may also cause the emission of noxious fumes.\nKEMET strongly recommends that if there are any doubts regarding the disposal of conductive polymer aluminum solid \nelectrolytic capacitors, that advice be sought from the local regulating authority.\nIn addition, KEMET would like to request that users of aluminum electrolytic capacitors respect the needs of the environment \nand, wherever possible, recover as much of the materials as possible, i.e. aluminum.\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\n17 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • One East Broward Boulevard A4067_A750 • 8/8/2023\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA750 105°CProduct Safety cont.\n4. Unsafe Use\nMost failures are of a passive nature and do not represent a safety hazard. A hazard may, however, arise if this failure causes \na dangerous malfunction of the equipment in which the capacitor is employed. Circuits should be designed to fail safe under \nthe normal modes of failure.\nThe usual failure mode is an increase in leakage current or short circuit. Other possible modes are decrease of capacitance, \nincrease in dissipation factor (and impedance) or an open circuit. Capacitors should be used in a well-ventilated enclosure or \ncabinet.\n5. Fumigation\nIn many countries throughout the world it is now common practice to fumigate shipments of products in order to control \ninsect infestation, particularly when wooden packaging is used. Currently, methyl bromide is widely used as a fumigant, \nwhich can penetrate cardboard packing and polymer bags and, therefore, come into direct contact with equipment or \ncomponents contained within.  \n \nIf aluminum electrolytic capacitors become exposed to methyl bromide then corrosion may occur, depending upon the \nconcentration and exposure time to the chemical.  \n \nThis failure mode can affect all types of KEMET aluminum electrolytic capacitors. Methyl bromide can penetrate the seals of \naluminum electrolytic capacitors and cause internal corrosion of the anode connection, resulting in the component becoming \nopen circuit. The rate of corrosion will depend upon the level of exposure to methyl bromide as well as the subsequent \noperating conditions, such as voltage and temperature. It may take months or, in some cases, several years before the \ncomponent becomes open circuit.\n6. Dielectric Absorption\nA phenomenon known as dielectric absorption can cause aluminum electrolytic capacitors to recharge themselves. The \nphenomenon is well known but impossible to predict with any great accuracy, so potentially any electrolytic product could be \naffected. Thus, a capacitor that has been charged and then completely discharged will appear to recharge itself if left open \ncircuit; this will manifest itself as a small voltage across the terminals of the capacitor. Generally, the voltages seen are less \nthan 20 VDC. However, higher voltages have on occasion been reported.  \n \nIn order to avoid any problems caused by this voltage, KEMET recommends that capacitors be discharged before connecting \nto the terminals.\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\n18 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • One East Broward Boulevard A4067_A750 • 8/8/2023\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA750 105°CKEMET Electronics Corporation Sales Oﬃ   ces\nFor a complete list of our global sales offi   ces, please visit www.kemet.com/sales.\nDisclaimer\nYAGEO Corporation and its affi   liates do not recommend the use of commercial or automotive grade products for high reliability applications or manned space fl  ight.\nAll product specifi  cations, statements, information and data (collectively, the “Information”) in this datasheet are subject to change.
