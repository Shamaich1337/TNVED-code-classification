The device includes an oscillator that feeds a gate-drive circuit. The gate-drive, \ncomprising a frequency divider and a break-before-make (BBM) logic, provides two complementary output \nsignals which alternately turn the two output transistors on and off.\nThe output frequency of the oscillator is divided down by an asynchronous divider that provides two \ncomplementary output signals with a 50% duty cycle. A subsequent break-before-make logic inserts a dead-time \nbetween the high-pulses of the two signals. The resulting output signals, present the gate-drive signals for \nthe output transistors. As shown in the functional block diagram, before either one of the gates can assume \nlogic high, there must be a short time period during which both signals are low and both transistors are \nhigh-impedance. This short period, known as break-before-make time, is required to avoid shorting out both \nends of the primary.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Push-Pull Converter\nPush-pull converters require transformers with center-taps to transfer power from the primary to the secondary \n(see Figure 8-1 ).\nCCR1\nCR2\nQ1 Q2VINVOUT\nRLCCR1\nCR2\nQ1 Q2VINVOUT\nRL\nFigure 8-1. Switching Cycles of a Push-Pull Converter\nWhen Q 1 conducts, V IN drives a current through the lower half of the primary to ground, thus creating a negative \nvoltage potential at the lower primary end with regards to the V IN potential at the center-tap.\nAt the same time the voltage across the upper half of the primary is such that the upper primary end is positive \nwith regards to the center-tap in order to maintain the previously established current flow through Q 2, which now \nhas turned high-impedance. The two voltage sources, each of which equaling V IN, appear in series and cause a \nvoltage potential at the open end of the primary of 2×V IN with regards to ground.\nPer dot convention the same voltage polarities that occur at the primary also occur at the secondary. The \npositive potential of the upper secondary end therefore forward biases diode CR 1. The secondary current SN6501-Q1\nSLLSEF3C – JUNE 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN6501-Q1\nstarting from the upper secondary end flows through CR 1, charges capacitor C, and returns through the load \nimpedance R L back to the center-tap.\nWhen Q 2 conducts, Q 1 goes high-impedance and the voltage polarities at the primary and secondary reverse. \nNow the lower end of the primary presents the open end with a 2×V IN potential against ground. In this case CR 2 \nis forward biased while CR 1 is reverse biased and current flows from the lower secondary end through CR 2, \ncharging the capacitor and returning through the load to the center-tap.\n8.3.2 Core Magnetization\nFigure 8-2  shows the ideal magnetizing curve for a push-pull converter with B as the magnetic flux density and \nH as the magnetic field strength. When Q 1 conducts the magnetic flux is pushed from A to A’, and when Q 2 \nconducts the flux is pulled back from A’ to A. The difference in flux and thus in flux density is proportional to the \nproduct of the primary voltage, V P, and the time, t ON, it is applied to the primary: B ≈ V P × tON.\nRDSB\nH\nAA’VIN VP\nVDS\nVIN= VP+VDS\nFigure 8-2. Core Magnetization and Self-Regulation Through Positive Temperature Coefficient of R DS(on) \nThis volt-seconds (V-t) product is important as it determines the core magnetization during each switching cycle. \nIf the V-t products of both phases are not identical, an imbalance in flux density swing results with an offset from \nthe origin of the B-H curve. If balance is not restored, the offset increases with each following cycle and the \ntransformer slowly creeps toward the saturation region.\nFortunately, due to the positive temperature coefficient of a MOSFET’s on-resistance, the output FETs of the \nSN6501 have a self-correcting effect on V-t imbalance. In the case of a slightly longer on-time, the prolonged \ncurrent flow through a FET gradually heats the transistor which leads to an increase in R DS-on . The higher \nresistance then causes the drain-source voltage, V DS, to rise. Because the voltage at the primary is the \ndifference between the constant input voltage, V IN, and the voltage drop across the MOSFET, V P = V IN – V DS, VP \nis gradually reduced and V-t balance restored.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe functional modes of the SN6501 are divided into start-up, operating, and off-mode.\n8.4.1 Start-Up Mode\nWhen the supply voltage at Vcc ramps up to 2.4V typical, the internal oscillator starts operating at a start \nfrequency of 300 kHz. The output stage begins switching but the amplitude of the drain signals at D1 and D2 has \nnot reached its full maximum yet.\n8.4.2 Operating Mode\nWhen the device supply has reached its nominal value ±10% the oscillator is fully operating. However variations \nover supply voltage and operating temperature can vary the switching frequencies at D1 and D2 between 250 \nkHz and 495 kHz for V CC = 3.3 V ±10%, and between 300 kHz and 620 kHz for V CC = 5 V ±10%.\n8.4.3 Off-Mode\nThe SN6501 is deactivated by reducing V CC to 0 V. In this state both drain outputs, D1 and D2, are high-\nimpedance.www.ti.comSN6501-Q1\nSLLSEF3C – JUNE 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: SN6501-Q1\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and \nTI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for determining \nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN6501-Q1 is a transformer driver designed for low-cost, small form-factor, isolated DC-DC converters \nutilizing the push-pull topology. The device includes an oscillator that feeds a gate-drive circuit. The gate-drive, \ncomprising a frequency divider and a break-before-make (BBM) logic, provides two complementary output \nsignals which alternately turn the two output transistors on and off.\nFigure 9-1. SN6501-Q1 Block Diagram\nThe output frequency of the oscillator is divided down by an asynchronous divider that provides two \ncomplementary output signals, S and S, with a 50% duty cycle. A subsequent break-before-make logic inserts \na dead-time between the high-pulses of the two signals. The resulting output signals, G 1 and G 2, present the \ngate-drive signals for the output transistors Q 1 and Q 2. As shown in Figure 9-2 , before either one of the gates \ncan assume logic high, there must be a short time period during which both signals are low and both transistors \nare high-impedance. This short period, known as break-before-make time, is required to avoid shorting out both \nends of the primary.\nfOSC\nS\nS\nG1\nG2\nQ1\nQ2\nFigure 9-2.

Typical Application Schematic (SN6501-Q1)\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nFor this design example, use the parameters listed in Table 9-1  as design parameters.\nTable 9-1. Design Parameters\nDESIGN PARAMETER EXAMPLE VALUE\nInput voltage range 3.3 V ± 3%\nOutput voltage 5 V\nMaximum load current 100 mA\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nThe following recommendations on components selection focus on the design of an efficient push-pull converter \nwith high current drive capability. Contrary to popular belief, the output voltage of the unregulated converter \noutput drops significantly over a wide range in load current. The characteristic curve in Figure 6-11  for example \nshows that the difference between V OUT at minimum load and V OUT at maximum load exceeds a transceiver’s \nsupply range. Therefore, in order to provide a stable, load independent supply while maintaining maximum \npossible efficiency the implementation of a low dropout regulator (LDO) is strongly advised.\nThe final converter circuit is shown in Figure 9-7 . The measured V OUT and efficiency characteristics for the \nregulated and unregulated outputs are shown in Figure 6-1  to Figure 6-28 .\n9.2.2.1 SN6501 Drive Capability\nThe SN6501 transformer driver is designed for low-power push-pull converters with input and output voltages in \nthe range of 3 V to 5.5 V. While converter designs with higher output voltages are possible, care must be taken \nthat higher turns ratios don’t lead to primary currents that exceed the SN6501 specified current limits.\nUnlike SN6505  devices, SN6501 does not have soft-start, internal current limit, or thermal shutdown (TSD) \nfeatures. Therefore, unregulated large currents exceeding device absolute maximum current ratings may \ndamage the device or affect its long-term reliability. In addition, high capacitive loads at the isolated power \nsupply output may appear as short circuits to SN6501 during power-up and may exceed the device\'s maximum \ncurrent ratings. When using SN6501, it is recommended to incorporate LDOs with low short-circuit current limits \nor soft-start features to ensure excessive current is not drawn from SN6501.\n9.2.2.2 LDO Selection\nThe minimum requirements for a suitable low dropout regulator are:www.ti.comSN6501-Q1\nSLLSEF3C – JUNE 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: SN6501-Q1\n•Its current drive capability should slightly exceed the specified load current of the application to prevent the \nLDO from dropping out of regulation. Therefore for a load current of 100 mA, choose a 100 mA to 150 mA \nLDO. While regulators with higher drive capabilities are acceptable, they also usually possess higher dropout \nvoltages that will reduce overall converter efficiency.\n•The internal dropout voltage, V DO, at the specified load current should be as low as possible to maintain \nefficiency. For a low-cost 150 mA LDO, a V DO of 150 mV at 100 mA is common. Be aware however, that \nthis lower value is usually specified at room temperature and can increase by a factor of 2 over temperature, \nwhich in turn will raise the required minimum input voltage.\n•The required minimum input voltage preventing the regulator from dropping out of line regulation is given \nwith:\nVI-min = V DO-max  + V O-max (1)\nThis means in order to determine V I for worst-case condition, the user must take the maximum values for V DO \nand V O specified in the LDO data sheet for rated output current (i.e., 100 mA) and add them together. Also \nspecify that the output voltage of the push-pull rectifier at the specified load current is equal or higher than \nVI-min. If it is not, the LDO will lose line-regulation and any variations at the input will pass straight through to \nthe output. Hence below V I-min the output voltage will follow the input and the regulator behaves like a simple \nconductor.\n•The maximum regulator input voltage must be higher than the rectifier output under no-load. Under this \ncondition there is no secondary current reflected back to the primary, thus making the voltage drop across \nRDS-on  negligible and allowing the entire converter input voltage to drop across the primary. At this point the \nsecondary reaches its maximum voltage of\nVS-max  = V IN-max  × n (2)\nwith V IN-max  as the maximum converter input voltage and n as the transformer turns ratio. Thus to prevent the \nLDO from damage the maximum regulator input voltage must be higher than V S-max . Table 9-2  lists the maximum \nsecondary voltages for various turns ratios commonly applied in push-pull converters with 100 mA output drive.\nTable 9-2. Required Maximum LDO Input Voltages for Various Push-Pull Configurations\nPUSH-PULL CONVERTER LDO\nCONFIGURATION VIN-max  [V] TURNS-RATIO VS-max  [V] VI-max [V]\n3.3 V IN to 3.3 V OUT 3.6 1.5 ± 3% 5.6 6 to 10\n3.3 V IN to 5 V OUT 3.6 2.2 ± 3% 8.2 10\n5 VIN to 5 V OUT 5.5 1.5 ± 3% 8.5 10\n9.2.2.3 Diode Selection\nA rectifier diode should always possess low-forward voltage to provide as much voltage to the converter output \nas possible. When used in high-frequency switching applications, such as the SN6501 however, the diode \nmust also possess a short recovery time. Schottky diodes meet both requirements and are therefore strongly \nrecommended in push-pull converter designs. A good choice for low-volt applications and ambient temperatures \nof up to 85°C is the low-cost Schottky rectifier MBR0520L with a typical forward voltage of 275 mV at 100-mA \nforward current. For higher output voltages such as ±10 V and above use the MBR0530 which provides a higher \nDC blocking voltage of 30 V.\nLab measurements have shown that at temperatures higher than 100°C the leakage currents of the above \nSchottky diodes increase significantly. This can cause thermal runaway leading to the collapse of the rectifier \noutput voltage. Therefore, for ambient temperatures higher than 85°C use low-leakage Schottky diodes, such as \nRB168M-40.SN6501-Q1\nSLLSEF3C – JUNE 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN6501-Q1\nForward Voltage, V - VF0.2 0.3 0.4 0.51\nForward Current, I - AF\n0.010.1T = 125°CJ 25°C 75°C -40°C\nForward Voltage, V - VF0.2 0.1 0.3 0.4 0.51\nForward Current, I - AF\n0.010.1T = 100°CJ 75°C 25°C-25°C0°CFigure 9-4.

For minimum ripple make this capacitor 1 μF to 10 μF. In a 2-layer PCB design with a \ndedicated ground plane, place this capacitor close to the primary center-tap to minimize trace inductance. In a \n4-layer board design with low-inductance reference planes for ground and V IN, the capacitor can be placed at \nthe supply entrance of the board. To ensure low-inductance paths use two vias in parallel for each connection to \na reference plane or to the primary center-tap.\nThe bulk capacitor at the rectifier output smoothes the output voltage. Make this capacitor 1 μF to 10 μF.\nThe small capacitor at the regulator input is not necessarily required. However, good analog design practice \nsuggests, using a small value of 47 nF to 100 nF improves the regulator’s transient response and noise \nrejection.\nThe LDO output capacitor buffers the regulated output for the subsequent isolator and transceiver circuitry. The \nchoice of output capacitor depends on the LDO stability requirements specified in the data sheet. However, in \nmost cases, a low-ESR ceramic capacitor in the range of 4.7 μF to 10 μF will satisfy these requirements.\n9.2.2.5 Transformer Selection\n9.2.2.5.1 V-t Product Calculation\nTo prevent a transformer from saturation its V-t product must be greater than the maximum V-t product applied \nby the SN6501. The maximum voltage delivered by the SN6501 is the nominal converter input plus 10%. The \nmaximum time this voltage is applied to the primary is half the period of the lowest frequency at the specified \ninput voltage. Therefore, the transformer’s minimum V-t product is determined through:\nmax IN-max\nmin IN-max\nminT VVt V =\n2 2 f/c179 /c180\n/c180\n(3)\nInserting the numeric values from the data sheet into the equation above yields the minimum V-t products of\n.min\nmin3.6 VVt = 7.2 Vμs for 3.3 V, and2 250 kHz\n5.5 VVt = 9.1Vμs for 5 V applications2 300 kHz/c179/c180\n/c179/c180\n(4)\nCommon V-t values for low-power center-tapped transformers range from 22 V μs to 150 V μs with typical \nfootprints of 10 mm x 12 mm. However, transformers specifically designed for PCMCIA applications provide as \nlittle as 11 Vμs and come with a significantly reduced footprint of 6 mm x 6 mm only.\nWhile Vt-wise all of these transformers can be driven by the SN6501, other important factors such as isolation \nvoltage, transformer wattage, and turns ratio must be considered before making the final decision.\n9.2.2.5.2 Turns Ratio Estimate\nAssume the rectifier diodes and linear regulator has been selected. Also, it has been determined that the \ntransformer choosen must have a V-t product of at least 11 V μs. However, before searching the manufacturer \nwebsites for a suitable transformer, the user still needs to know its minimum turns ratio that allows the push-pull \nconverter to operate flawlessly over the specified current and temperature range. This minimum transformation \nratio is expressed through the ratio of minimum secondary to minimum primary voltage multiplied by a correction \nfactor that takes the transformer’s typical efficiency of 97% into account.\ns min\nmin\np minvn 1.031v\x10\n\x10 u \n(5)SN6501-Q1\nSLLSEF3C – JUNE 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN6501-Q1\nVS-min must be large enough to allow for a maximum voltage drop, V F-max , across the rectifier diode and still \nprovide sufficient input voltage for the regulator to remain in regulation.

Establishing the Required Minimum Turns Ratio Through N min = 1.031 × V S-min / VP-min \nThen calculating the available minimum primary voltage, V P-min, involves subtracting the maximum possible \ndrain-source voltage of the SN6501, V DS-max , from the minimum converter input voltage V IN-min :\nVP-min = V IN-min  – V DS-max (7)\nVDS-max  however, is the product of the maximum R DS(on)  and I D values for a given supply specified in the \nSN6501 data sheet:\nVDS-max  = R DS-max  × IDmax (8)\nThen inserting Equation 8  into Equation 7  yields:\nVP-min = V IN-min  - R DS-max  x IDmax (9)\nand inserting Equation 9  and Equation 6  into Equation 5  provides the minimum turns ration with:\nF-max DO-max O-max\nmin\nIN-min DS-max D-maxV + V + Vn = 1.031V R I/c180/c45 /c180\n(10)\nExample:\nFor a 3.3 V IN to 5 V OUT converter using the rectifier diode MBR0520L and the 5 V LDO TPS76350, the data \nsheet values taken for a load current of 100 mA and a maximum temperature of 85°C are V F-max  = 0.2 V,\nVDO-max  = 0.2 V, and V O-max  = 5.175 V.\nThen assuming that the converter input voltage is taken from a 3.3 V controller supply with a maximum ±2% \naccuracy makes V IN-min  = 3.234 V. Finally the maximum values for drain-source resistance and drain current at \n3.3 V are taken from the SN6501 data sheet with R DS-max  = 3 Ω and I D-max  = 150 mA.\nInserting the values above into Equation 10  yields a minimum turns ratio of:\nmin0.2V + 0.2V + 5.175 Vn = 1.031 = 23.234 V 3 Ω 150 mA/c180/c45 /c180\n(11)\nMost commercially available transformers for 3-to-5 V push-pull converters offer turns ratios between 2.0 and 2.3 \nwith a common tolerance of ±3%.www.ti.comSN6501-Q1\nSLLSEF3C – JUNE 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: SN6501-Q1\n9.2.2.5.3 Recommended Transformers\nDepending on the application, use the minimum configuration in Figure 9-6  or standard configuration in Figure \n9-7.\nFigure 9-6.
