POK threshold when V OUT is rising is nominally 92%. This threshold is 90% when V OUT is falling. After crossing the \n90% level, there is a 256 clock cycle (~50us) delay before POK is de- asserted.

System Block Diagram  \n \nFunctional Description \nSynchronous Buck Converter  \nThe EN5364QI  is a synchronous, programmable \npower supply with integrated power MOSFET \nswitches and integrated inductor. The nominal \ninput voltage range is 2. 375-6.6V. The output \nvoltage is programmed using an external resistor divider network. The feedback control loop is a \ntype III, voltage-mode, and the device uses a \nlow-noise PWM topology. Up to 6A of continuous output current can be drawn from this converter. \nThe 4MHz operating frequency enables the use \nof small -size input and output capacitors.  \nThe power supply has the following protection features:  \n• Over-current protection with hiccup mode.  \n• Short Circuit pr otection.  \n• Thermal shutdown with hysteresis.  \n \n 9 www.altera.com/enpirion \n03544 October 11, 2013 Rev E\n  EN5364QI  \n \n• Under -voltage lockout circuit to disable the \nconverter output when the input voltage is \nless than approximately 2.2V  \nEnable Operation  \nThe ENABLE pin provides a means to start \nnormal operation or to shut down the device. A \nlogic high will enable the converter into normal \noperation.  When the ENABLE pin is asserted \n(high) the device will undergo a normal soft start. A logic low will disable the converter. A logic low will power down the device in a controlled \nmanner  and the device is subsequently shut \ndown. The device will remain shut -down for the \nduration of the ENABLE lockout time (see \nElectrical Characteristics Table) . If the ENABLE \nsignal is re-asserted during this time, the device \nwill power up with a normal soft -start at the end \nof the ENABLE lockout time.  \nThe Enable threshold is a precision Analog voltage rather than a digital logic threshold. Precision threshold along with choice of soft -start \ncapacitor helps to accurately sequence multiple power supplies in a system.  \nFrequency Synchronization \nThe switching frequency of the DC/DC converter can be phase-locked to an external clock source \nto move unwanted beat frequencies out of band. \nTo avail this feature, the ternary input M/S  pin \nshould be floating or pulled low. The internal switching clock of the DC/DC converter can then \nbe phase locked to a clock signal applied to S_IN \npin. An activity detector recognizes the presence of an external clock signal and automatically phase-locks the internal osci llator to this external \nclock. Phase-lock will occur as long as the input \nclock frequency is within ±10% of the free \nrunning frequency  (see Electrical Characteristics \ntable) . When no clock signal is present, the \ndevice reverts to the free running frequency of the internal oscillator.  The external clock input \nmay be swept between 3.6 MHz and 4.4 MHz at \nrepetition rates of up to 10 kHz in order to reduce EMI frequency components.  \nMaster / Slave Parallel Operation  \nMultiple EN5364QI devices may be connected in parallel in a Master/Slave configuration to handle load currents  greater than device maximum \nrating. The device is set in Master mode by pulling the ternary M/S pin low or in Slave mode \nby pulling M/S pin high to V\nIN through an external \nresistor . When this pin is in Float state, parallel \noperation is not possible. In master mode, the internal PWM signal is output on the S_OUT pin. \nThis PWM signal from the Master can be fed to \none or more Slave devices at its S_IN input. The Slave device acts like an extension of the power FETs in the Master. As a practical matter, \nparalleling more than 4 devices may be very \ndifficult from the view point of maintaining very \nlow impedance in V\nIN and V OUT lines.  \nThe table below summarizes the different \nconfigurations for the S_IN and S_OUT pins depending on the condition of the M/S pin: \nWhen M/S \npin is: High (Slave)  Low (Master)  Float  \nS_IN  input \nshould be:  S_OUT from \nMaster  External Sync input  if \nneeded ( NC for internal \nclock) \nS_OUT  is \nequal to  \n(subject to \nS_DELAY):  Same duty \ncycle as S_IN  Same duty \ncycle as internal PWM  S_IN or \ninternal clock \nPlease contact Altera Power  Applications support \nfor more information on Master / Slave operation.  \nPhase Delay \nIn all cases, S_OUT can be delayed with respect \nto internal switching clock or the clock applied to \nS_IN. Multiple EN5364QI devices on a system \nboard may be daisy chained to reduce or eliminate input ripple as well as avoiding beat frequency components. The EN5364QIs can all \nbe phase locked by feeding S_OUT of one \ndevice into S_IN of the next device in a daisy chain. All the switchers  now run at a common \nfrequency. The delay is controlled by the value of \na resistor connected between S_D ELAY and \nAGND pins. The magnitude of this delay as a \nfunction of S_DELAY resistor is shown in the \nElectrical C haracteristics table.  See Figures 6 \nand 7 for an example of using phase delay.  \nMargining \nUsing MAR1 and MAR2 pins,  the nominal output \n 10 www.altera.com/enpirion \n03544 October 11, 2013 Rev E\n  EN5364QI  \n \nvoltage can be increased / decreased by 2.5, 5 \nor 10 % for system compliance, reliability or other \ntests.  The POK threshold voltages scale with the \nmargined output voltages. The foll owing table \nprovides the possible combinations:  \n \nM AR1  M AR2  Output Modulation  \nFloat  Float  0% \nLow Low -2.5%  \nHigh Low +2.5%  \nLow High -5% \nHigh High +5% \nLow  Float  -10% \nHigh Float  +10%  \nFloat  High 0%, Delay Byp ass \nFloat  Low Reserved  \nNote: Low means t ie to GND.  High means t ie to V IN \nas shown in Figure 5.  \nAs shown above, when MAR1 is floating, and MAR2 is high, the device enters the delay \nbypass mode. In this mode, the delay from the \ninternal clock or S_IN to S_OUT is almost \neliminated (see Electrical Characteristics table).  \nSoft- Start Operation  \nThe SS pin in conjunction with a small external \ncapacitor between this pin and AGND provides \nthe soft start function to limit the in-rush current \nduring start -up. During start -up of the converter \nthe reference voltage to the error amplifier is \ngradually increased to its final level as  an internal \ncurrent source of typically 10uA  charges  the soft \nstart capacitor . The typical soft -start time for the \noutput to reach regulation voltage, from when \nAVIN > V UVLO and E NABLE  crosses its logic high \nthreshold, is given by:  \nTSS = (CSS * 65KΩ) ± 25% \n Where the soft -start time T\nSS is in seconds  and \nthe soft -start capacitance C SS is in Farads . \nTypically, around 15nF is recommended. The \nsoft-start capacitor should be between 4.7nF and \n100nF. A proper choice of SS capacitance can be used advantageously for power supply sequencing using the precision Enable threshold.  \n During a soft -start cycle, when the soft -start \ncapacitor voltage reaches 0.60V, the output has reached its programmed regulation range. Note that the soft -start current source will continue to \ncharge the SS  capacitor beyond 0.6V. During \nnormal operation, the soft -start capacitor will \ncharge to a final value of ~1.5V.  \nSoft- Shutdown Operation  \nWhen the Enable signal is de-asserted, the soft -\nstart capacitor is discharged in a controlled manner. Thus the output v oltage ramps down \ngradually. The internal circuits are kept active for the duration of soft -shutdown, thereafter they are \ndeactivated.  \nPre-Bias Operation  \nWhen EN_PB is asserted, the device will support a monotonic output voltage ramp if the output \ncapacitor is charged to a pre-bias level. \nProprietary circuit ensures the output voltage ramps monotonically from pre-bias voltage to the programmed output voltage. Monotonic start -up \nis guaranteed by design for pre-bias voltages \nbetween 20% and 85% of the program med \noutput voltage.  This feature is not supported \nwhen ENABLE is tied to V\nIN. \nPOK Operation  \nThe POK signal indicates if  the output voltage is \nwithin a specified range. The POK signal is \nasserted when the rising output voltage crosses \n92% (nominal) of the programmed output \nvoltage. POK is de-asserted ~50us (256 clock \ncycles) after the falling output voltage crosses 90% (nominal) of the programmed voltage. POK is also de-asserted if the output voltage exceeds \n120% of the programmed output. If the feedback \nloop is broken, POK will remain de-asserted (output < 92% of programmed value), and the \noutput voltage will equal the input voltage. If \nhowever, there is a short across the PFET, and \nthe feedback is in place, POK will be de-asserted as an over voltage conditi on. The power NFET is \nalso turned on, resulting in a lar ge input supply \ncurrent. This in turn is expected to trip the OCP \nof the EN5364QI input power supply.  \nPOK is an open drain output. It requires an external pull up. Multiple EN5364QI’s POK pins \nmay be connected to a single pull up. The open \ndrain NFET is designed to sink up to 4mA. The \n 11 www.altera.com/enpirion \n03544 October 11, 2013 Rev E\n  EN5364QI  \n \npull-up resistor value should be chosen \naccordingly  for when POK is logic low.  \nInput Under -Voltage Lock -Out (UVLO)  \nWhen the input voltage is below a required \nvoltage lev el (V UVLO) for normal operation, the \nconverter switching is inhibited. The lock -out \nthreshold has hysteresis to prevent chatter. \nUVLO is implemented to ensure that operation \ndoes not begin before there is adequate voltage to properly bias all internal circ uitry. \nOver -Current Protection (OCP)  \nThe current limit and short -circuit  protection is \nachieved by sensing the current flowing through a sense P -FET.  When the sensed current \nexceeds the current limit, both NFET and PFET switches are turned off. If the over-current \ncondition is removed, the over -current protection \ncircuit will re -enable the PWM operation. If the \nover-current condition persists, the circuit will \ncontinue to protect the device.  \n The OCP trip point is nominally set to 175% of \nmaximum rated load. In the event the OCP circuit trips, the device enters a hiccup mode. The \ndevice is disabled for ~ 10msec  and restarted \nwith a normal soft -start. This cycle can continue \nindefinitely as long as the over current condition \npersists. During soft -start at power up or fault \nrecovery, the hiccup mode is disabled and the device has cycle-by -cycle current limiting.  Thermal Overload Protection  \nThermal shutdown will disable operation when the Junction temperature exceeds approximately \n150ºC. Once the junction temperature drops by \napproximately 20ºC, the converter will re-start with a normal soft -start. \nCompensation \nThe EN5364 uses of a type III compensation \nnetwork. Most of this network is integrated. \nHowever a phase lead capacitor is required in parallel with upper resistor of the external divider  \nnetwork (see Figure 4). This network  results in a \nwide loop bandwidth and excellent load transient performance. It is optimized for around 50μF  of \noutput filter capacitance at the voltage sensing \npoint. Additional decoupling capacitance may be \nplaced beyond the voltage sensing point outside the control loop. V oltage-mode operation \nprovides high noise immunity at light load.  Further, voltage-mode control provides superior \nimpedance matching to ICs processed in sub 90nm  technologies.  \nIn exceptional cases modifications to the \ncompensation may be required. The EN5364QI \nprovides the capability to modify the control loop response to allow for customization for specific \napplications. For more information,  contact Altera \nPower Applications  support. \nApplication Information \nOutput Voltage Programming \nThe EN5364 output voltage is determined by the \nvoltage presented at the VFB pin. This voltage is \nset by way of a resistor divider between V OUT and \nAGND with the midpoint going to VFB. A phase \nlead capacitor C A is also required for stabilizing \nthe loop. Figure 4 shows the required \ncomponents and the equations to calculat e their \nvalues . Please note the equations below are \nwritten to optimize the control loop as a function of input voltage.   \nFigure 4:  Output voltage resistor divider and phase -\nlead capacitor calculation.

In the \nHigh state, they are to be tied to V\nIN through an \nexternal resistor R EXT in order to limit the input \ncurrent to the pin (see Figure 5) .

Furthermore, two or more synchronized \nEN5364’s can have a programmable phase \ndelay with respect to each other to minimize input \nvoltage ripple and noise.

Alternate ENABLE configurations, and \nother small signal pins need to be connected \nand routed according to specific customer \napplication.  Please see the Gerber files at \nwww.altera.com/enpirion  for exact dimensions \nand other layers . \nRecommendation 1:  Input and output filter \ncapacitors should be placed on the same side \nof the PCB, and as close to the EN5364 QI \npackage as possible. They should be \nconnected to the device with very short and wide traces . Do not use thermal reliefs or \nspokes when connecting the capacitor pads  to \nthe respective nodes . The +V and GND traces \nbetween the capacitors and the EN5364QI should be as close to each other as possible so that the gap between the two nodes is minimized, even under the capacitors.  \nRecommendation 2: The system ground \nplane referred to in recommendations 2 and 3 should be the first layer immediately below the \nsurface layer.  This ground plane should be continuous and un-interrupted below the converter and the input/output capacitors.  \nRecommendation 3 : The large and small thermal pads underneath the component must be connected to the system ground plane through as many vias as possible. The drill \ndiameter of the vias should be 0.33mm , and \nthe vias must have at least 1 oz. copper plating \non the inside wall, making the finished hole size around 0.20-0.26mm . Do not use thermal \nreliefs or spokes to connect the vias to the ground plane. This connection provides the path for heat dissipation from the converter. Please see figures: 8, 9, and 10.  \nRecommendation 4 : Multiple small vias (the \nsame size as the thermal vias discussed in \nrecommendation 3) should be used to connect \nground terminal of the input capacitor and output capacitors to the system ground plane. It is preferred to put these vias along the edge \nof the GND copper closest to the +V copper. These vias connect the input/output filter capacitors to the GND plane, and help reduce parasitic inductances in the input and output \ncurrent loops.  \nRecommendation 5 : AVIN is the power supply \nfor the small -signal control circuits. It should be \nconnected to the input voltage at a quiet point. \nIn Figure 8 this connection is made at the input capacitor.  \nRecommendation 6: The layer 1 metal under − RA and RB are voltage \nprogramming resistors.  \n− CA is used for loop compensation.  \n− CSS is the soft -start \ncapacitor.  \n− AGND via is also a test point.  \n− Test point added for EAOUT.  \n 15 www.altera.com/enpirion \n03544 October 11, 2013 Rev E\n  EN5364QI  \n \nthe device must not be more than shown in \nFigure 8. See the section regarding exposed \nmetal on bottom of package. As with any \nswitch -mode DC/DC converter, try not to run \nsensitive signal or control lines underneath the \nconverter package on other layers.  \nRecommendation 7: The V OUT sense point \nshould be just after the last output filter capacitor. Keep the sense trace short  in order \nto avoid noise coupling into the node.  \nRecommendation 8 : Keep R A, CA, and R B \nclose to the VFB pin (see Figures 4 and 8). The VFB pin is a high-impedance, sensitive \nnode. Keep the trace to this pin as short as \npossible.  Whenever possible, connect R\nB \ndirectly to the AGND pin instead of going through the GND plane.\nThermal Considerations  \nThe Altera Enpirion EN 5364QI DC -DC \nconverter is packaged in an 11 x 8 x 1.85mm \n68-pin QFN package. The QFN package is \nconstructed with copper lead frames that have exposed thermal pads. The recommended \nmaximum junction temperature for continuous \noperation is 125°C. Continuous operation above 125°C will reduce long-term reliability. The device has a thermal overload protection \ncircuit designed to shut it off at an approximate \njunction temperature value of 150°C.  \nThe silicon is mounted on a copper thermal \npad that is exposed at the bottom of the package. There is an additional thermal pad in \nthe corner of the package which provides \nanother path for heat flow  out from the \npackage. The thermal resistance from the \nsilicon to the exposed thermal pads is very low. \nIn order to take advantage of this low resistance, the exposed thermal pads on the \npackage should be soldered directly on to a \ncopper ground pad on layer 1 of the PCB. The \nPCB then acts as a heat sink. In order for the \nPCB to be an effective heat sink, the device \nthermal pads should be coupled to copper \nground planes using multiple vias (refer to \nLayout R ecommendations section).  \nThe junction temperature, T\nJ, is calculated from \nthe ambient temperature, T A, the device power \ndissipation, P D, and the device junction-to -\nambient thermal resistance, θ JA in °C/W:  \nTJ = T A + (PD)(θJA) \nThe junction temperature, T J, can also be \nexpressed in terms of the device case temperature, T C, and the device junction-to -\ncase thermal resistance, θ JC in °C/W, as \nfollows : \nTJ = T C + (PD)(θJC) \nThe device case temperature, T C, is the \ntemperature at the center of the larger exposed \nthermal pad at the bottom of the package.  \nThe device junction-to -ambient and junction-to -\ncase thermal resistances, θ JA and θ JC, are \nshown in the Thermal Characteristics table. \nThe θ JC is a function of the device and the 68-\npin QFN package design. The θ JA is a function \nof θ JC and the user’s system design \nparameters that include the thermal effectiveness of the customer PCB and airflow.  \nThe θ\nJA value shown in the Thermal \nCharacteristics table is for free convection with \nthe device heat sunk (through the thermal \npads ) to a copper plated four -layer PC board \nwith a full ground and a full power plane following JEDEC EIJ/JESD 51 Standards. The \nθ\nJA can be reduced with the use of forced air \nconvection. Because of the strong dependence \non the thermal effectiveness of the PCB and the system design, the actual θ\nJA value will be \na function of the specific application.  \nWhen operating on a board with the θ JA of the \nthermal characteristics table, no thermal \nderatings are needed to operate all the way up \nto maximum output current . \n \n \n 16 www.altera.com/enpirion \n03544 October 11, 2013 Rev E\n  EN5364QI  \n \nDesign Considerations for Lead-Frame Based Modules  \nExposed Metal on Bottom of Package \nLead-frames offer many advantages in thermal performance, in reduced electrical lead resistance, \nand in overall foot print.  However, they do require some special considerations.  \nIn the assembly process lead frame construction requires that, for mechanical support, some of the \nlead-frame cantilevers be exposed at the point where wire-bond or internal passives are attached.  \nThis results in several small pads being exposed on the bottom of the package, as shown in Figure 9.  \nOnly the two thermal pads and the perimeter pads are to be mechanically or electrically connected to \nthe PC board. The PCB top layer under the EN5364 QI should be clear of any metal (copper pours, \ntraces, or vias) except for the two thermal pads . The “grayed-out” area in Figure 9 represents the \narea that should be clear of any metal on the top layer of the PCB . Any layer 1 metal under the \ngrayed-out area runs the risk of undesirable shorted connections even if it is covered by soldermask . \nOne exposed pad in the grayed-out area can have V IN metal under it as noted in Figure 9.  \nFigure 10 demonstrates the recommended PCB footprint for the EN5364 QI. Figure 11 shows the \npackage dimensions.  \n \nFigure 9: Lead -Frame exposed metal.
