Alaser-trimmed,\nmonolithic, integrated circuit provides excellent low-\nlevel signal accuracy and high-output voltage and\ncurrent.\nThe OPA548 operates from either single ordual\nsupplies for design flexibility. Insingle-supply\noperation, the input common-mode range extends\nbelow ground.\nThe OPA548 isinternally protected against\novertemperature conditions and current overloads. In\naddition, the OPA548 isdesigned toprovide an\naccurate, user-selected current limit. Unlike other\ndesigns that use apower resistor inseries with the\noutput current path, theOPA548 senses theload\nindirectly. The current limit isadjustable from 0Ato5\nAwith anexternal resistor and potentiometer, or\ncontrollable digitally with avoltage-out orcurrent-out\nDAC.\nThe Enable/Status (E/S) pinprovides two functions.\nAninput onthepinnotonly disables theoutput stage\ntoeffectively disconnect theload, butalso reduces\nthequiescent current toconserve power. The E/Spin\noutput canbemonitored todetermine iftheOPA548\nisinthermal shutdown.\nThe OPA548 device isavailable inanindustry-\nstandard 7-lead staggered and straight lead TO-220\npackage, and a7-lead DDPAK surface-mount plastic\npower package. The copper tab allows easy\nmounting toaheat sink orcircuit board forexcellent\nthermal performance.

compensation somatched resistances ontheinputs willreduce errors. After themain voltage gain stage\nisthehigh current output stage with temperature compensated class A/Bbiasing toreduce crossover distortion.\nLocal feedback intheoutput stage may require additional compensation forhighly reactive loads (see Output\nStage Compensation ).\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Adjustable Current Limit\nThe OPA548 features anaccurate, user-selected current limit. The current limit issetfrom 0Ato5Aby\ncontrolling theinput totheILIMpin. Unlike other designs, which use apower resistor inseries with theoutput\ncurrent path, theOPA548 senses theload indirectly. This allows thecurrent limit tobesetwith a0-μAto330-μA\ncontrol signal. Incontrast, other designs require alimiting resistor tohandle thefulloutput current (5Ainthis\ncase).\nWith theOPA548, thesimplest method foradjusting thecurrent limit uses aresistor orpotentiometer connected\nbetween theILIMpinandV–according totheEquation 1:\n(1)\nThe low-level control signal (0μAto330μA)also allows thecurrent limit tobedigitally controlled.\nSee Figure 41forasimplified schematic oftheinternal circuitry used tosetthecurrent limit. Leaving theILIMpin\nopen programs theoutput current tozero, while connecting ILIMdirectly toV–programs themaximum output\ncurrent limit, typically 5A.\n12OPA548\nSBOS070D –OCTOBER 1997 –REVISED DECEMBER 2019 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: OPA548Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1997 –2019, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFeature Description (continued)\n7.3.2 Enable/Status (E/S) Pin\nThe Enable/Status pinprovides twofunctions: forcing thispinLOW disables theoutput stage, orE/S can be\nmonitored todetermine iftheOPA548 isinthermal shutdown. One orboth ofthese functions canbeused onthe\nsame device using single ordual supplies. Fornormal operation (output enabled), theE/Spincanbeleftopen or\npulled HIGH (atleast 2.4Vmore than thenegative rail). Asmall value capacitor connected between theE/Spin\nandV–may berequired fornoisy applications.\n7.3.3 Thermal Shutdown Status\nInternal thermal shutdown circuitry shuts down theoutput when thedietemperature reaches approximately\n160°C,resetting when thediehascooled to140°C.The E/Spincanbemonitored todetermine ifshutdown has\noccurred. During normal operation thevoltage ontheE/Spinistypically 3.5Vmore than thenegative rail.Once\nshutdown hasoccurred, thisvoltage drops toapproximately 350mVmore than thenegative rail.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Output Disable\nAunique feature oftheOPA548 isitsoutput disable capability. This function notonly conserves power during\nidleperiods (quiescent current drops toapproximately 6mA), butalso allows multiplexing inlowfrequency (f<\n20kHz), multichannel applications. Signals greater than 20kHz may cause leakage current toincrease in\ndevices thatareshutdown. Figure 33shows thetwoOPA548s inaswitched amplifier configuration. The ON/OFF\nstate ofthetwoamplifiers iscontrolled bythevoltage ontheE/Spin.\nTodisable theoutput, theE/Spinispulled LOW, nogreater than 0.8Vmore than thenegative rail.Typically the\noutput isshutdown in1μs.Figure 23provides anexample ofhow toimplement thisfunction using asingle\nsupply. Figure 24gives acircuit fordual-supply applications. Toreturn theoutput toanenabled state, theE/Spin\nshould bedisconnected (open) orpulled toatleast (V–)+2.4V.Itshould benoted thatpulling theE/SpinHIGH\n(output enabled) does notdisable internal thermal shutdown.\nFigure 23.Output Disable With aSingle Supply Figure 24.Output Disable With Dual Supplies\n13OPA548\nwww.ti.com SBOS070D –OCTOBER 1997 –REVISED DECEMBER 2019\nProduct Folder Links: OPA548Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1997 –2019, Texas Instruments Incorporated8Application andImplementation\nNOTE\nInformation inthe following applications sections isnot part ofthe TIcomponent\nspecification, and TIdoes notwarrant itsaccuracy orcompleteness.

The\nmaximum value foroutput voltage swing at3-Aisapproximately within 4Vofeither rail,standard 15-V power\nsupplies rated at>2.5Aeach willsuffice.\n8.2.1.2.2 Gain Setting andInput Configuration\nAunity gain noninverting application could beprovided bysimply connecting theoutput ofanoperational\namplifier back toitsinput, with thesignal applied tothenoninverting input. Power operational amplifiers are\nfrequently subject tounpredictable load impedances that can cause instability. Increasing gain can enhance\nstability. Furthermore, thefeedback network provides locations forfurther opportunities forstability enhancing\ncomponents ifnecessary.\nInthisapplication two10-kΩresistors areused fortheinput and feedback resistance, which would normally\nresult inanoninverting gain of2.Adding avoltage divider consisting ofR1and R2reduces theinput signal by\nhalfbefore itisapplied totheoperational amplifier.

Parameters which vary\nsignificantly with operating voltage areshown Typical Characteristics .\nSome applications donotrequire equal positive and negative output voltage swing. Power-supply voltages do\nnotmust beequal. The OPA548 can operate with aslittle as8Vbetween thesupplies and with upto60V\nbetween thesupplies. Forexample, thepositive supply could besetto55Vwith thenegative supply at–5V,or\nvice-versa.\n9.1 Output Stage Compensation\nThe complex load impedances common inpower operational amplifier applications can cause output stage\ninstability. Fornormal operation output compensation circuitry istypically notrequired. However, iftheOPA548 is\nintended tobedriven intocurrent limit, anR/C network may berequired. See Figure 38foranoutput series R/C\ncompensation (snubber) network which generally provides excellent stability.\nAsnubber circuit may also enhance stability when driving large capacitive loads (>1000 pF)orinductive loads\n(motors, loads separated from theamplifier bylong cables). Typically 3Ωto10Ωinseries with 0.01μFto0.1μF\nisadequate. Some variations incircuit value may berequired with certain loads.\n9.2 Output Protection\nReactive andEMF-generating loads canreturn load current totheamplifier, causing theoutput voltage toexceed\nthepower-supply voltage. This damaging condition canbeavoided with clamp diodes from theoutput terminal to\nthepower supplies, asshown inFigure 38.Schottky rectifier diodes with a5Aorgreater continuous rating are\nrecommended.\nFigure 37.Output Disable andThermal Shutdown\nStatus With aSingle SupplyFigure 38.Motor Drive Circuit\n23OPA548\nwww.ti.com SBOS070D –OCTOBER 1997 –REVISED DECEMBER 2019\nProduct Folder Links: OPA548Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1997 –2019, Texas Instruments IncorporatedOutput Protection (continued)\nFigure 39.Output Disable andThermal Shutdown Status With Dual Supplies\n24OPA548\nSBOS070D –OCTOBER 1997 –REVISED DECEMBER 2019 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: OPA548Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1997 –2019, Texas Instruments Incorporated10Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\n10.1.1 Safe Operating Area\nStress ontheoutput transistors isdetermined both bytheoutput current and bytheoutput voltage across the\nconducting output transistor, VS–VO.The power dissipated bytheoutput transistor isequal totheproduct ofthe\noutput current andthevoltage across theconducting transistor, VS–VO.The Safe Operating Area (SOA curve,\nFigure 40)shows thepermissible range ofvoltage andcurrent.\nFigure 40.4-ΩLoad Plotted onOPA548 SOA forthisApplication\nThe safe output current decreases asVS–VOincreases.

ForDCsignals, power dissipation is\nequal totheproduct ofoutput current times thevoltage across the conducting output transistor. Power\ndissipation can beminimized byusing thelowest possible power-supply voltage necessary toassure the\nrequired output voltage swing.\nForresistive loads, themaximum power dissipation occurs ataDCoutput voltage ofone-half thepower-supply\nvoltage. Dissipation with ACsignals islower. Application Bulletin SBOA022 explains how tocalculate ormeasure\npower dissipation with unusual signals andloads.\nFigure 42.TO-220 Thermal Resistance vsAluminum Plate Area\nFigure 43.DDPAK Thermal Resistance vsCircuit Board Copper Area\n10.1.4 Thermal Considerations\nPower dissipated intheOPA548 willcause thejunction temperature torise. The OPA548 hasthermal shutdown\ncircuitry that protects theamplifier from damage. The thermal protection circuitry disables theoutput when the\njunction temperature reaches approximately 160°C,allowing thedevice tocool. When thejunction temperature\ncools toapproximately 140°C,theoutput circuitry isagain enabled. Depending onload andsignal conditions, the\nthermal protection circuit may cycle onand off.This limits thedissipation oftheamplifier butmay have an\nundesirable effect ontheload.\nT 220 with Thermalloy\n6030B Heat Sink\nR = 16.7°C/WO-\nθJAP = (T –T ) /D J(max) A R\nT = 150°CθJA\nJ(max)\nWith infinite heat sink\n(R = 2.5°C/W),\nmax P = 50 W at T = 25°CθJA\nD A\nAmbient Temperature (°C)Power Dissipation (W)\nDDPAK or TO-220\nR = 65°C/W (no heat sink)θJADDPAK\nR = 26°C/W\n(3 in , 1-oz. copper\nmounting pad)θJA\n2\n27OPA548\nwww.ti.com SBOS070D –OCTOBER 1997 –REVISED DECEMBER 2019\nProduct Folder Links: OPA548Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1997 –2019, Texas Instruments IncorporatedLayout Guidelines (continued)\nAny tendency toactivate thethermal protection circuit indicates excessive power dissipation oraninadequate\nheat sink. Forreliable operation, junction temperature should belimited to125°C,maximum. Toestimate the\nmargin ofsafety inacomplete design (including heat sink) increase theambient temperature until thethermal\nprotection istriggered. Use worst-case load andsignal conditions. Forgood reliability, thermal protection should\ntrigger more than 35°Cmore than themaximum expected ambient condition ofyour application. This produces a\njunction temperature of125°Catthemaximum expected ambient condition.\nThe internal protection circuitry oftheOPA548 was designed toprotect against overload conditions. Itwas not\nintended toreplace proper heat sinking. Continuously running theOPA548 intothermal shutdown willdegrade\nreliability.\n10.1.5 Heat Sinking\nMost applications require aheat sink toassure that themaximum operating junction temperature (125°C)isnot\nexceeded. Inaddition, thejunction temperature should bekept aslow aspossible forincreased reliability.\nJunction temperature canbedetermined according totheequation:\nTJ=TA+PDRθJA\nwhere\n•RθJA=RθJC+RθCH+RθHA\n•TJ=Junction Temperature (°C)\n•TA=Ambient Temperature (°C)\n•PD=Power Dissipated (W)\n•RθJC=Junction-to-Case Thermal Resistance (°C/W)\n•RθCH=Case-to-Heat Sink Thermal Resistance (°C/W)\n•RθHA=Heat Sink-to-Ambient Thermal Resistance (°C/W)\n•RθJA=Junction-to-Air Thermal Resistance (°C/W) (2)\nFigure 44shows maximum power dissipation versus ambient temperature with and without theuse ofaheat\nsink. Using aheat sink significantly increases themaximum power dissipation atagiven ambient temperature as\nshown.\nThe difficulty inselecting theheat sink required liesindetermining thepower dissipated bytheOPA548. ForDC\noutput into apurely resistive load, power dissipation issimply theload current times thevoltage developed\nacross theconducting output transistor, PD=IL(VS–VO).Other loads arenotassimple. Consult Application\nBulletin SBOA022 forfurther insight oncalculating power dissipation. Once power dissipation foranapplication is\nknown, theproper heat sink canbeselected.\nFigure 44.Maximum Power Dissipation vsAmbient Temperature\nV- V+\nGrey area is \nground layer 0.1µF\nbypasses0.01µF\nbypass\nOutput\nE/SRILIM\nR2 R1\nVIN\n/c40 /c41\n/c40 /c41J A\nHA JC CH\nD\nHAT T\nP\n125 C 40 C2.5 C / W 1 C / W 13.5 C / W5W/c45/c113 /c61 /c45 /c113 /c43 /c113\n/c176 /c45 /c176/c113 /c61 /c45 /c176 /c43 /c176 /c61 /c176\n28OPA548\nSBOS070D –OCTOBER 1997 –REVISED DECEMBER 2019 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: OPA548Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1997 –2019, Texas Instruments IncorporatedLayout Guidelines (continued)\n10.1.5.1 Heat Sink Selection Example\nATO-220 package isdissipating 5W.The maximum expected ambient temperature is40°C.Find theproper\nheat sink tokeep thejunction temperature less than 125°C(150°Cminus 25°Csafety margin).\nCombining Equation 2andEquation 3gives:\nTJ=TA+PD(RθJC+RθCH+RθHA) (3)\nTJ,TA,andPDaregiven. RθJCisprovided inthespecification table, 2.5°C/W (DC). RθCHcanbeobtained from the\nheat sink manufacturer. Itsvalue depends onheat sink size, area, and material used. Semiconductor package\ntype, mounting screw torque, insulating material used (ifany), and thermal joint compound used (ifany) also\naffect RθCH.Atypical RθCHforaTO-220 mounted package is1°C/W. Now wecansolve forRθHA:\n(4)\nTomaintain junction temperature less than 125°C,theheat sink selected must have aRθHAless than 14°C/W. In\nother words, theheat sink temperature rise above ambient must beless than 67.5°C(13.5 °C/W ×5W).For\nexample, at5-W Thermalloy model number 6030B hasaheat sink temperature riseof66°Cmore than ambient\n(RθHA=66°C/5W=13.2°C/W),which isless than the67.5°Crequired inthisexample. Figure 44shows power\ndissipation versus ambient temperature foraTO-220 package with a6030B heat sink.\nAnother variable toconsider isnatural convection versus forced convection airflow. Forced-air cooling byasmall\nfancanlower RθJCA(RθCH+RθHA)dramatically. Heat sink manufactures provide thermal data forboth ofthese\ncases. Foradditional information ondetermining heat sink requirements, consult Application Bulletin SBOA021 .\nAsmentioned earlier, once aheat sink hasbeen selected, thecomplete design should betested under worst-\ncase load andsignal conditions tomaintain proper thermal protection.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 45.Recommended Layout Example\n29OPA548\nwww.ti.com SBOS070D –OCTOBER 1997 –REVISED DECEMBER 2019\nProduct Folder Links: OPA548Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1997 –2019, Texas Instruments Incorporated11Device andDocumentation Support\n11.1 Device Support\n11.1.1 Third-Party Products Disclaimer\nTI\'S PUBLICATION OFINFORMATION REGARDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS ORSERVICES DOES NOT\nCONSTITUTE ANENDORSEMENT REGARDING THE SUITABILITY OFSUCH PRODUCTS ORSERVICES\nORAWARRANTY, REPRESENTATION ORENDORSEMENT OFSUCH PRODUCTS ORSERVICES, EITHER\nALONE ORINCOMBINATION WITH ANY TIPRODUCT ORSERVICE.\n11.2 Documentation Support\n11.2.1 Related Documentation\nTexas Instruments, Heat Sinking —TO-3 Thermal ModelSBOA021 applicaiton bulletin\n11.3 Receiving Notification ofDocumentation Updates\nToreceive notification ofdocumentation updates, navigate tothedevice product folder onti.com.
