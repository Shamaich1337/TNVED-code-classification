Patent Protec ted. Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited. \n © 2016 MPS. All Rights Reserved. OPERATION\nThe MP2143 uses constant on-time control with \ninput-voltage feed-forward to stabilize the switching frequency over its full input range. At \nlight load, the MP2143 employs a proprietary \ncontrol over the low-side MOSFET (LS-FET) and inductor current to eliminate ringing on switching node and to improve efficiency. \nConstant On-Time Control \nWhen compared to fixed-frequency PWM control, \nconstant on-time control offers a simpler control loop and faster transient response. By using input-voltage feed-forward, the MP2143 maintains a nearly constant switching frequency across the entire input and output voltage range. The \nswitching pulse ON time can be estimated as: \nOUT\nON\nINVt0 . 8 3 3 sV\uf03d\uf0d7\uf06d  \nTo prevent inductor current runaway during the \nload transient, the MP2143 has a fixed minimum \nOFF time of 50ns. However, this minimum OFF time limit does not affect the operation of the MP2143 in steady state in any way. \nLight Load Operation \nIn light load condition, the MP2143 uses a \nproprietary control scheme to save power and improve efficiency: It gradually ramps down the LS-FET current to its minimum instead of turning off the LS-FET immediately when the \ninductor current starts to reverse. The gradual \ncurrent drop avoids ringing at the switching node that always occurs in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation. \nConsidering the internal circuit propagation time, \nthe typical delay is 50ns. It means the inductor \ncurrent still fall after the ZCD is trigger in this \ndelay. If the inductor current falling slew rate is fast (VOUT voltage is high or close to Vin), the low side MOSFET is turned off and inductor current may be negative. This phenomena will \ncause MP2143 can not enter DCM operation. If \nthe DCM mode is required, the off time of low side MOSFET in CCM should be longer than 100ns. For example, Vin is 3.6V and Vo is 3.3V, the off time in CCM is 50ns. It is difficult to enter DCM at light load. And using smaller inductor \ncan improve it and make it enter DCM easily. \nEnable  \nWhen the input voltage exceeds the under-\nvoltage lockout (UVLO) threshold—typically 2.2V—the MP2143 is enabled by pulling the EN pin above 1.2V. Leaving the EN pin floating or grounded will disable the MP2143. There is an \ninternal 1M Ω resistor from the EN pin to ground. \nSoft-Start/Stop  \nMP2143 has a built-in soft-start that ramps up \nthe output voltage at a constant slew rate that avoids overshooting at startup. The soft-start time is typically about 1ms. When disabled, the \nMP2143 ramps down the internal reference \nvoltage to allow the load to linearly discharge the output. \nPower GOOD Indicator  \nMP2143 has an open drain with 500k Ω pull-up \nresistor pin for power good (PG) indication. \nWhen the FB pin is within ±10% of regulation voltage (0.6V), the PG pin is pulled up to VIN by the internal resistor. If the FB pin voltage is outside the ±10% window, the PG pin is pulled to ground by an internal MOSFET. The \nMOSFET has a maximum R\ndson of less than \n100Ω. \nCurrent limit \nThe MP2143 has a 4.8A current limit for the \nhigh side switch (HS-FET). When the HS-FET \nhits its current limit, the MP2143 enters hiccup \nmode until the current drops to prevent the inductor current from building and possibly damaging the components.  \nShort Circuit and Recovery  \nThe MP2143 also enters short-circuit protection \n(SCP) mode when it hits the current limit, and tries to recover from the short circuit by entering hiccup mode. In SCP, the MP2143 disables the output power stage, discharges a soft-start capacitor, and then enacts a soft-start \nprocedure. If the short-circuit condition still \nholds after soft-start ends, the MP2143 repeats this operation until the short circuit ceases and output rises back to regulation level. \nMP2143 – 3A, 5.5V, 1.2MHz, 40 μA IQ, COT SYNCHRONOUS STEP-DOWN SWITCHER  \n \nMP2143 Rev. 1.07 www.MonolithicPower.com 12 \n7/4/2016 MPS Proprietary Information.

APPLICATION INFORMATION\nCOMPONENT SELECTION \nSetting the Output Voltage \nThe external resistor divider sets the output \nvoltage (see the Typical Application schematic \non page 1). The feedback resistor R1 must \naccount for both stability and dynamic response, and thus can not be too large or too small. Choose an R1 value between 120k Ω and \n200kΩ. R2 is then given by: \noutR1R2V10.6\uf03d\n\uf02d \nThe feedback circuit is shown as Figure 2. \nR1\nR2Vout\nFBMP2143\n \nFigure 2: Feedback Network \nTable 1 lists the recommended resistors values \nfor common output voltages. \nTable 1: Resistor Values for Common Output \nVoltages \nVOUT (V) R1 (k Ω) R2 (k Ω) \n1.0 200(1%) 300(1%)\n1.2 200(1%) 200(1%)\n1.8 200(1%) 100(1%)\n2.5 200(1%) 63.2(1%)\n3.3 200(1%) 44.2(1%)\nSelecting the Inductor \nA 0.82µH to 4.7µH inductor is recommended for \nmost applications. For highest efficiency, chose an inductor with a DC resistance less than 15mΩ. For most designs, the inductance value \ncan be derived from the following equation.  \nOUT IN OUT\n1\nIN L OSCV( V V )LVI f\uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d\uf0b4\uf044 \uf0b4 Where ΔIL is the inductor ripple current. \nChoose an inductor current to be approximately \n30% of the maximum load current. The \nmaximum inductor peak current is: \nL\nL(MAX) LOADIII2\uf044\uf03d\uf02b  \nSelecting the Input Capacitor \nThe input current to the step-down converter is \ndiscontinuous, and requires a capacitor to supply the AC current to the step-down converter while maintaining the DC input voltage. Use low-ESR \ncapacitors for the best performance. Ceramic \ncapacitors with X5R or X7R dielectrics are highly recommended because of their low ESR values and small temperature coefficients. For most applications, a 10µF capacitor is sufficient. \nFor higher output voltage, use 47 μF to improve \nsystem stability. \nSince the input capacitor absorbs the input \nswitching current it requires an adequate ripple current rating. The RMS current in the input capacitor can be estimated by: \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\n\uf0b4\uf02d \uf0b4\uf03d\nINOUT\nINOUTLOAD 1CVV1VVI I  \nThe worse case condition occurs at VIN = \n2VOUT, where: \n2IILOAD\n1C\uf03d  \nFor simplification, choose an input capacitor \nwhose RMS current rating greater than half of the maximum load current. \nThe input capacitor can be electrolytic, tantalum \nor ceramic. When using electrolytic or tantalum capacitors, use a small high-quality ceramic capacitor (0.1 μF), placed as close to the IC as \npossible. When using ceramic capacitors, make sure that they have enough capacitance to \nprevent excessive voltage ripple at input.
