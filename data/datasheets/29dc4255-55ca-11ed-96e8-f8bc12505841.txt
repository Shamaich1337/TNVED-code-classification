This device is designed for high speed \napplications requiring low jitter.  \nThe device has a differential input equipped with center-tapped, \ndifferential, 100 Ω on-chip termination resistors. The input can \naccept dc-coupled LVPECL, CML, 3.3 V CMOS (single-ended), \nand ac-coupled 1.8 V CMOS, LVDS, and LVPECL inputs. A V REF \npin is available for biasing ac-coupled inputs.  \nThe ADCLK944 features four full-swing emitter-coupled logic \n(ECL) output drivers. For LVPECL (positive ECL) operation, bias V\nCC to the positive supply and V EE to ground. For ECL \noperation, bias V CC to ground and V EE to the negative supply. \nThe ECL output stages are designed to directly drive 800 mV each side into 50 Ω terminated to V\nCC − 2 V for a total differen-\ntial output swing of 1.6 V . \nThe ADCLK944 is available in a 16-lead LFCSP and is specified \nfor operation over the standard industrial temperature range of \n−40°C to +85°C. \n \nADCLK944  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 2 of 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS \nFeatures .............................................................................................. 1 \xa0\nApplications ....................................................................................... 1 \xa0\nFunctional Block Diagram .............................................................. 1 \xa0\nGeneral Description ......................................................................... 1 \xa0\nRevision History ............................................................................... 2 \xa0\nSpecifications ..................................................................................... 3 \xa0\nClock Inputs and Outputs ........................................................... 3 \xa0\nTiming Characteristics ................................................................ 3 \xa0\nPower .............................................................................................. 4 \xa0\nAbsolute Maximum Ratings ............................................................ 5 \xa0\nDetermining Junction Temperature .......................................... 5 \xa0ESD Caution...................................................................................5 \xa0\nThermal Performance ...................................................................5 \xa0\nPin Configuration and Function Descriptions ..............................6 \xa0\nTypical Performance Characteristics ..............................................7 \xa0\nTheory of Operation .........................................................................9 \xa0\nClock Inputs ...................................................................................9 \xa0\nClock Outputs ................................................................................9 \xa0\nPCB Layout Considerations ...................................................... 10 \xa0\nInput Termination Options ....................................................... 11 \xa0\nOutline Dimensions ....................................................................... 12 \xa0\nOrdering Guide .......................................................................... 12 \xa0\n \nREVISION HISTORY \n3/10—Revision 0: Initial Version \n \n \n  ADCLK944\n \nRev. 0 | Page 3 of 12 SPECIFICATIONS \nTypical values are given for V CC − V EE = 3.3 V and T A = 25°C, unless otherwise noted.

The maximum specified \nfrequency is the point at which the output voltage swing is 50% \nof the standard LVPECL swing (see Figure 4 ). \nThe device has a differential input equipped with center-tapped, \ndifferential, 100 Ω on-chip termination resistors. The input can \naccept dc-coupled LVPECL, CML, 3.3 V CMOS (single-ended, \n3.3 V operation only), and ac-coupled 1.8 V CMOS, LVDS, and LVPECL inputs. A V\nREF pin is available for biasing ac-coupled \ninputs (see Figure 20  and Figure 21 ). \nMaintain the differential input voltage swing from approxi-mately 400 mV p-p to no more than 3.4 V p-p. See Figure 18  \nthrough Figure 21  for various clock input termination schemes. \nOutput jitter performance is significantly degraded by an input slew rate below 1 V/ns, as shown in Figure 11 . The ADCLK944 \nis specifically designed to minimize added random jitter over a wide input slew rate range. Whenever possible, clamp excessively large input signals with fast Schottky diodes because attenuators reduce the slew rate. Input signal runs of more than a few centi-meters should be over low loss dielectrics or cables with good high frequency characteristics. \nCLOCK OUTPUTS \nThe specified performance necessitates using proper transmis-\nsion line terminations. The LVPECL outputs of the ADCLK944 \nare designed to directly drive 800 mV into a 50 Ω cable or into microstrip/stripline transmission lines terminated with 50 Ω referenced to V\nCC − 2 V , as shown in Figure 13 . The LVPECL \noutput stage is shown in Figure 12 . The outputs are designed  \nfor best transmission line matching. If high speed signals must \nbe routed more than a centimeter, either the microstrip or the \nstripline technique is required to ensure proper transition times and to prevent excessive output ringing and pulse-width-dependent \npropagation delay dispersion. \n \nVEEVCC\nQ\nQ\n08770-013 \nFigure 12.

In this case, VS_DRV on the ADCLK944 should equal V\nCC of the receiving buffer. Although the resistor combination \nshown in Figure 14  results in a dc bias point of VS_DRV − 2 V , \nthe actual common-mode voltage is VS_DRV − 1.3 V because there is additional current flowing from the ADCLK944 LVPECL \ndriver through the pull-down resistor. \nVS_DRV\n50Ω\n50ΩSINGLE-ENDED\n(NOT COUPLED)VS_DRV\nADCLK944 VCC\nLVPECL127Ω 127Ω\n83Ω 83Ω\n8770-015 0\nFigure 14. DC-Coupled, 3.3 V LVPE CL Far-End Thevenin Termination \nLVPECL Y-termination (see Figure 15 ) is an elegant termination \nscheme that uses the fewest components and offers both odd- \nand even-mode impedance matching. Even-mode impedance matching is an important consideration for closely coupled trans-mission lines at high frequencies. Its main drawback is that it offers \nlimited flexibility for varying the drive strength of the emitter-\nfollower LVPECL driver. This can be an important consideration \nwhen driving long trace lengths but is usually not an issue. \nADCLK944 VS_DRV VCC = VS_DRV\nZ0 = 50Ω\nLVPECL\n50Ω50Ω 50Ω\n8770-016Z0 = 50Ω\n0\nFigure 15.

AC-Coupled LVPECL with Parallel Transmission Line \n \nADCLK944  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 10 of 12 PCB LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS \nThe ADCLK944 buffer is designed for very high speed applica-\ntions. Consequently, high speed design techniques must be used \nto achieve the specified performance. It is critically important to use low impedance supply planes for both the negative supply \n(V\nEE) and the positive supply (V CC) planes as part of a multilayer \nboard. Providing the lowest inductance return path for switching \ncurrents ensures the best possible performance in the target \napplication.  \nThe following references to the ground plane assume that the V EE \npower plane is grounded for LVPECL operation. Note that, for \nECL operation, the V CC power plane becomes the ground plane. \nIt is also important to adequately bypass the input and output \nsupplies. Place a 1 μF electrolytic bypass capacitor within several \ninches of each V CC power supply pin to the ground plane. In \naddition, place multiple high quality 0.001 μF bypass capacitors \nas close as possible to each V CC supply pin, and connect the \ncapacitors to the ground plane with redundant vias. Select high frequency bypass capacitors for minimum inductance and ESR. To improve the effectiveness of the bypass at high frequencies, \nminimize parasitic layout inductance. Also, avoid discontinuities \nalong input and output transmission lines; such discontinuities \ncan affect jitter performance. \nIn a 50 Ω environment, input and output matching have a signif-\nicant impact on performance. The buffer provides internal 50 Ω \ntermination resistors for both the CLK and CLK\n inputs. Normally, \nthe return side is connected to the reference pin that is provided. \nBypass the termination potential using ceramic capacitors to \nprevent undesired aberrations on the input signal due to parasitic \ninductance in the termination return path. If the inputs are dc-coupled to a source, take care to ensure that the pins are within \nthe rated input differential and common-mode voltage ranges. If the return is floated, the device exhibits a 100 Ω cross-termi-\nnation, but the source must then control the common-mode \nvoltage and supply the input bias currents. \nESD/clamp diodes between the input pins prevent the application \nfrom developing excessive offsets to the input transistors. ESD diodes are not optimized for best ac performance. When a clamp \nis required, it is recommended that appropriate external diodes \nbe used. \nExposed Metal Paddle \nThe exposed metal paddle on the ADCLK944 package is both an \nelectrical connection and a thermal enhancement. For the device to function properly, the paddle must be properly attached to \nthe V\nEE pins. \nWhen properly mounted, the ADCLK944 also dissipates heat \nthrough its exposed paddle. The PCB acts as a heat sink for the ADCLK944. The PCB attachment must provide a good thermal path to a larger heat dissipation area. This requires a grid of vias from the top layer of the PCB down to the V\nEE power plane (see \nFigure 17 ). The ADCLK944 evaluation board (ADCLK944/PCBZ) \nprovides an example of how to attach the part to the PCB. \nVIAS TO VEE POWER\nPLANE\n08770-018 \nFigure 17.
