Low power consumption makes  \nit ideal for battery-powered portable instruments. \nThe ADM3101E  conforms to the EIA/TIA-232E and ITU-T V .28 \nspecifications and operates at data rates of up to 460 kbps. All RS-232 (T\nOUT and R IN) and CMOS (T IN and R OUT) inputs  \nand outputs are protected against electrostatic discharges (up  \nto ±15 kV ESD protection).  Because of the ±15 kV ESD protection of the ADM3101E  \ninput/output pins, this device is ideally suited for operation  \nin electrically harsh environments or where RS-232 cables are \nfrequently plugged and unplugged. \nFour external 0.1 μF charge pump capacitors are used for the \nvoltage doubler/inverter permitting operation from a single \n3.3 V supply. \nThe ADM3101E  is available in both a 12-lead LFCSP and 16-lead \nQSOP , specified over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range. \n \n \nADM3101E Data Sheet\nRev.

D | Page 8 of 12 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM3101E  is a single-channel RS-232 line driver/receiver. \nStep-up voltage converters, coupled with level shifting trans-\nmitters and receivers, allow RS-232 levels to be developed while \noperating from a single 3.3 V supply. \nCMOS technology is used to keep the power dissipation to  \nan absolute minimum, allowing maximum battery life in portable applications. \nCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe internal circuitry consists of the following main sections: \n\uf0b7 A charge pump voltage converter \n\uf0b7 A 3.3 V logic to an EIA/TIA-232E transmitter \n\uf0b7 An EIA/TIA-232E to a 3.3 V logic receiver \nADM3101E\nGND+3.3V INPU T\n+ +\n+C1\n0.1µF\n16V\nC2\n0.1µF\n16V\n++\nT\nR+3.3V TO +6.6V\nVOLTAGE DOUBLER\n+6.6V TO –6.6V\nVOLTAGE INVERTERC1+\nC1–\nC2+\nC2–\nTIN\nROUTCMOS\nINPUT\nCMOS\nOUTPUTRINVCC\nV+\nV–\nTOUTC5\n0.1µFC30.1µF6.3V\nC4\n0.1µF16V\nEIA/TIA-232EOUTPUT\nEIA/TIA-232E\nINPUT*\n*INTERNAL 5k Ω PULL-DOWN\n RESISTOR ON THE RS-232 INPUT.\n06766-011 \nFigure 12. Typical Operating Circuit \nCharge Pump Voltage Converter \nThe charge pump voltage converter consists of a 200 kHz oscil-\nlator and a switching matrix. The converter generates a ±6.6 V \nsupply (when unloaded) from the 3.3 V input level. This is achieved in two stages by using a switched capacitor technique, as illustrated in Figure 13 and Figure 14. First, the 3.3 V input supply is doubled to +6.6 V by using C1 as the charge storage element. The +6.6 V \nlevel is then inverted to generate −6.6 V using C2 as the storage \nelement. C3 is shown connected between V+ and V\nCC but is \nequally effective if connected between V+ and GND.  \nThe C3 and C4 capacitors are used to reduce the output ripple. \nThe values are not critical and can be increased, if desired. Larger capacitors (up to 10 μF) can also be used in place of the C1, C2, \nC3, and C4 capacitors. \nGNDC3 C1S1\nS2S3S4V+ = 2V\nCC\n+ +\nINTERNAL\nOSCILLATORVCC\nVCC\n06766-012 \nFigure 13.

Charge Pump Voltage Inverter \n3.3 V Logic to EIA/TIA-232E Transmitter \nThe transmitter driver converts the 3.3 V logic input levels  \ninto RS-232 output levels. When driving an RS-232 load with  \nVCC = 3.3 V , the output voltage swing is typically ±6 V . Internally, \nthe T IN pin has a weak pull-up that allows it to be driven by an \nopen-drain output, but the maximum operating data rate is \nreduced when the T IN pin is driven by an open-drain pin. \nEIA/TIA-232E to 3.3 V Logic Receiver  \nThe receiver is an inverting level shifter that accepts the RS-232 \ninput level and translates it into a 3.3 V logic output level. The \ninput has an internal 5 kΩ pull-down resistor to ground and is protected against overvoltages of up to ±30 V . An unconnected input is pulled to 0 V by the internal 5 kΩ pull-down resistor, which, therefore, results in a Logic 1 output level for an uncon-\nnected input or for an input connected to GND. \nThe receiver has a Schmitt trigger input with a hysteresis level \nof 0.4 V , which ensures error-free reception for both a noisy \ninput and for an input with slow transition times. \nCMOS Input Voltage Thresholds \nThe CMOS input and output pins (T IN and R OUT) of the \nADM3101E  are designed to interface with 1.8 V logic \nthresholds when V CC = 3.3 V . \nThe CMOS input and output pins (T IN and R OUT) of the \nADM3101E  are also designed to interface with TTL/CMOS \nlogic thresholds when V CC = 5 V . \nESD Protection on RS-232 and CMOS I/O Pins \nAll RS-232 (T OUT and R IN) and CMOS (T IN and R OUT) inputs  \nand outputs are protected against electrostatic discharges (up  to ±15 kV). \nHIGH BAUD RATE \nThe ADM3101E  features high slew rates, permitting data trans-\nmission at rates well in excess of the EIA/RS-232 specifications. \nThe RS-232 voltage levels are maintained at data rates of up to \n460 kbps, even under worst-case loading conditions, when T IN is \ndriven by a push-pull output. The slew rate is internally controlled \nto less than 30 V/μs to minimize EMI interference. \n \nData Sheet ADM3101E\n \nRev.
