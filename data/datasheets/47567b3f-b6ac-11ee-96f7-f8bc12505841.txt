AD5248 \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe AD5243 and AD5248 provide a compact 3 mm × 4.9 mm \npackaged solution for dual , 256- position adjustm ent applications.  \nThe AD5243 perform s the same electronic adjust ment function \nas a 3 -terminal mechanical potentiometer, and the  AD5248 \nperforms the same adjustment function as a 2 -terminal variable \nresistor . Available in four end -to-end resistance values (2.5 kΩ, \n10 kΩ, 50  kΩ, and  100 kΩ), these low temperature coefficient \ndevices are ideal for high accuracy and stability -variable \nresistance adjustments. The wiper settings are controllable \nthrough the I2C-compatible digital interface. The AD5248 has \nextra package address decode pins , AD0 and AD1, allowing \nmultiple parts to share the same I2C, 2-wire bus on a PCB. The \nresistance between the wiper and either endpoint of the fixed resistor varies linearly with respect to the digital code transferred  into the RDAC latch.  (The terms digital potentiometer, VR, \nand RDAC are used interchangeably.)  \nOperating from a 2.7 V to 5.5 V power supply and consuming less than 6 µA allows the AD5243/ AD5248 to be used  in \nportable battery -operated applications.  \nFor applications that program the AD5243/ AD5248 at the \nfactory, Analog Devices, Inc., offers device programming \nsoftware running on Windows® NT/2000/XP operating systems.  \nThis software effectively replaces the need for  external I\n2C \ncontrollers, which in turn enhances the time to market of \nsystems. An AD5243/ AD5248 evaluation kit and software are \navailable. The kit includes a cable and instruction manual.  \n \nAD5243/AD5248  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 13 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD5243 /AD5248 are 256-position, digitally controlled \nvariable resistor (VR) devices.  \nAn internal power-on preset places the wiper at midscale \nduring power-on, which simplifies the fault condition recovery \nat power-up.  \nPROGRAMMING THE VARIABLE RESISTOR AND \nVOLTAGE \nRheostat Operation \nThe nominal resistance of the RDAC between Terminal A and \nTerminal B is available in 2.5 kΩ, 10 kΩ, 50 kΩ, and 100 kΩ. \nThe nominal resistance (R AB) of the VR has 256 contact points \naccessed by the wiper terminal and the B terminal contact. The \n8-bit data in the RDAC latch is decoded to select one of the 256 \npossible settings.  \nA\nW\nBA\nW\nBA\nW\nB\n04109-0-012 \nFigure 37. Rheostat Mode Configuration \nAssuming that a 10 kΩ part is used, the first connection of the \nwiper starts at the B terminal for Data 0x00. Because there is  \na 160 Ω wiper contact resistance, such a connection yields a minimum of 320 Ω (2 × 160 Ω) resistance between Terminal W and Terminal B. The second connection is the first tap point, which corresponds to 359 Ω (R\nWB = R AB/256 + 2 × R W = 39 Ω + \n2 × 160 Ω) for Data 0x01. The third connection is the next tap \npoint, representing 398 Ω (2 × 39 Ω + 2 × 160 Ω) for Data 0x02, \nand so on. Each LSB data value increase moves the wiper up the resistor ladder until the last tap point is reached at 10,281 Ω \n(R\nAB + 2 × R W).  \nD5\nD4D3D7\nD6\nD2\nD1D0\nRDAC\nLATCH\nAND\nDECODERRS\nRS\nRS\nRSA\nW\nB\n04109-0-013 \nFigure 38.

Care should be taken to limit the current flow \nbetween W and B in this state to a maximum pulse current of no more than 20 mA. Otherwise, degradation or possible destruction \nof the internal switch contact may occur.  \nSimilar to the mechanical potentiometer, the resistance of the \nRDAC between Wiper W and Terminal A also produces a digitally controlled complementary resistance, R\nWA. When these \nterminals are used, the B terminal can be opened. Setting the \nresistance value for R WA starts at a maximum value of resistance \nand decreases as the data loaded in the latch increases in value. \nThe general equation for this operation is  \nW AB WA R RDD R \uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d 2256256)(   (2) \nWhen R AB is 10 kΩ and the B terminal is open circuited, the \noutput resistance, R WA, is set according to the RDAC latch \ncodes, as listed in Table 8.  \nTable 8.

C | Page 14 of 20 PROGRAMMING THE POTE NTIOMETER DIVIDER  \nVoltage Output Operation  \nThe digital potentiometer easily generates a voltage divider at \nwiper  to B and wiper  to A, proportional to the input voltage at \nA to B. Unlike the polarity of V DD to GND, which mus t be \npositive, voltage across A to B, W to A, and W to B can be at either polarity.  \nAVI\nW\nBVO\n04109-0-014 \nFigure 39. Potentiometer Mode Configuration  \nIf ignoring the effect of the wiper resistance for approximation, connecting the A terminal to 5 V an d the B terminal to ground \nproduces an output voltage at the wiper  to B, starting at 0 V up \nto 1 LSB less than 5 V . Each LSB of voltage is equal to the voltage  \napplied across T erminal A and Terminal B divided by the  \n256 positions of the potentiometer divider. The general equation  \ndefining the output voltage at V\nW with respect to ground for any \nvalid input voltage applied to Terminal A and Terminal B is \nB A W VDVDDV256256\n256)(−+=    (3) \nOperation of the digital potentiometer in the divider mode results in more accurate operation over  temperature. Unlike in \nthe rheostat mode, the output voltage is dependent mainly on the ratio of the internal resistors , R\nWA and R WB, not on the \nabsolute values. Therefore, the temperature drift reduces to 15 ppm/°C.  \nESD PROTECTION  \nAll digital inputs are protected with a series of input resistors and parallel Zener ESD structures, as shown in Figure 40 and \nFigure 41.

Maximum Terminal Voltages Set by V DD and GND  \nPOWER -UP SEQUENCE  \nBecause the ESD protection diodes limit the voltage compliance at the A, B, and W terminals (see Figure 42), it is important to \npower V\nDD/GND before applying voltage to the A, B, and W  \nterminals ; otherwise, the diode is forward -biased such that V DD \nis  powered unintentionally and may affect the rest of the user’s circuit. The ideal power -up sequence is in the following order: \nGND, V\nDD, digital inputs, and then V A, V B, and  VW. The relative \norder of powering V A, V B, V W, and the digital inputs is not \nimportant , as long as they are powered after V DD/GND.  \nLAYOUT AND POWER SUPPLY BYPASSING  \nIt is a good practice to employ compact, minimum lead length \nlayout design. The leads to the inputs should be as direct as possible with a minimum conductor length. Ground paths should have low resistance and low inductance.  \nSimilarly, it is also good practice to bypass the power supplies with  \nquality capacitors for optimum stability. Supply leads to the device  \nshould be bypassed with dis c or chip ceramic capacitors of 0.01  µF \nto 0.1 µF. Low ESR 1 µF to 10 µF tantalum or electrolytic capacitors  \nshould also be applied at the supplies to minimize any transient \ndisturbance and low frequency ripple (see Figure 43). In addition,  \nnote that the digital ground should be joined remotely to the \nanalog ground at one po int to minimize the ground bounce.  \nVDD\nGNDVDD\nC3\n10µFC1\n0.1µF AD5243+\n04109-0-018 \nFigure 43.

C | Page 15 of 20 CONSTANT BIAS TO RET AIN RESISTANCE SETTI NG \nFor users who desire nonvolatility but cannot justify the addi -\ntional cost of  an EEMEM, the AD5243/ AD5248 can be considered  \nlow cost alternatives by maintaining a constant bias to retain the \nwiper setting. The AD5243/ AD5248 are designed specifically for \nlow power applications , allowing  low power consumption even \nin battery -operated system s. The graph in Figure 44 demonstrates  \nthe power consumption from a 3.4 V , 450 mAhr Li -Ion cell phone  \nbattery  connected to the AD5243/ AD5248. The measurement \nover time shows that the device draws approximately 1.3  µA \nand consumes negligible power. Over a course of 30 days, the battery is depleted by less than 2%, the majority of which is due to the intrinsic leakage current of the battery itself.  \nDAYSBATTERY LIFE DEPLETED (%)\n090929496\n5 10 1598100102104106108110\n20 25 30\n04109-0-019TA= 25°C\n \nFigure 44. Battery Operating Life Depletio n This demonstrates that constantly biasing the potentiometer \ncan be  a practical approach. Most portable devices do not \nrequire the removal of batteries for the purpose of charging. \nAlthough the resistance setting of the AD5243/ AD5248 is lost \nwhen the battery needs replacement, such events occur rather infrequently such that this inconvenience is justified by the lower cost and sma ller size offered by the AD5243/ AD5248. If \ntotal power is lost, the user should be provided with a means to adjust the setting a ccordingly.  \n \n \n \n  \nAD5243/AD5248  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 16 of 20 I2C INTERFACE  \nI2C COMPATIBLE , 2-WIRE SERIAL BUS  \nThe 2 -wire, I2C-compatible  serial bus protocol operates as follows:  \n1. The master initiates data transfer by establishing a start \ncondition, which is when a high- to-low transition on the \nSDA line occurs while SCL is high (see Figure 45). The \nfollowing byte is the slave address byte, which consists of \nthe slave address followed by an R/ W bit (this bit deter -\nmines whether data is read from or written to t he slave \ndevice). The AD5243 has a  fixed slave address byte, \nwhereas  the AD5248 has two configurable address bits, \nAD0 and AD1 ( see Figure 10).  \nThe slave whose address corresponds to the transmitted \naddress responds by pulling the SDA line low during the ninth clock pulse (this is called  the a cknowledge bit). At \nthis stage, all other devices on the bus remain idle while the selected device waits for data to be written to or read from \nits serial register. If the R/\nW bit is high, the master reads \nfrom the slave device. On th e other hand, if the R/ W bit is \nlow, the master writes to the slave device.  \n2. In the write mode, the second byte is the instruction byte. \nThe first bit (MSB) of the instruction byte is the RDAC subaddress select bit. A logic low select s Channel 1 and a \nlogic high selects Channel 2.  \nThe second MSB, SD, is a shutdown bit. A logic high causes an open circuit at Terminal A while shorting the wiper to Terminal B. This operation yields almost 0 Ω in rheostat mode or 0 V in potentiometer mode . It is important to \nnote that the shutdown operation does not disturb the contents of the register. When the AD5243 or AD5248 is \nbrought out of shutdown, the previ ous setting is applied to \nthe RDAC. In addition , during shutdown, new settings can \nbe programmed. When the part is returned from shutdown, \nthe corresponding VR setting is applied to the RDAC.  \nThe remainder of the bits in the instruction byte are don’t \ncare bits (see Figure 10).  \nAfter acknowledging the instruction byte, the last byte in \nwrite mode is the data byte. Data is transmit ted over the \nserial bus in sequences of nine clock pulses (eight data bits \nfollowed by an acknowledge bit). The transitions on the  SDA line must occur during the low period of SCL and remain stable during the high period of SCL (see Figure 45 \nand Figure 46). \n3. In the read mode, the data byte follows immediately after the acknowledgment  of the slave address byte. Data is transmitted  \nover the serial bus in sequences of nine clock pulses (a slight  \ndifference with the write mode, where there are eight  data bits  \nfollowed by an acknowledge bit). Similarly, the transitions on the SDA line must  occur during the low period of SCL and \nremain stable during the high period of SCL (see Figure 47 \nand Figure 48).  \nNote that the channel of interest is the one that is previously  \nselected in write mode.  If users need to read the RDAC \nvalues of both channels, they need to program the first channel in write mode and then change to read mode to read the first channel value. After that, the user must return  \nthe device to  write mode with the second channel selected \nand read the second channel value in read mode. It is not necessary for users to issue the Frame 3 data b yte in write \nmode for subse quent readback operation. Users should refer \nto Figure 47 and Figure 48 for the programming format.  \n4. After all data bits have been read or written, a stop condition \nis established by the master. A stop condition is defined as \na low -to-high transition on the SDA line while SCL is high. \nIn write mode, the master pulls the SDA line high during the 10\nth clock pulse to establish a stop condition (see Figure \n45 and Figure 46). In read mode, the master issues a no \nacknowledge for the ninth clock pulse ( that is, the SDA line \nremains high). The master then brings the SDA line low before the 10\nth clock pulse, which goes high to establish a \nstop condition (see Figure 47 and Figure 48).  \nA repeated write function provides  the user with the flexibility  \nof updat ing the RDAC output multiple  times after addressing  \nand instructing the part only once. For example, after the RDAC has acknowledged its slave address and instruction \nbytes in write mode, the RDAC output updates on each \nsuccessive byte. If different instructions are needed, however,  \nthe write/read mode must restart with a new slave address, \ninstruction, and data byte. Similarly, a repeated read function  \nof the RDAC is also allowed. \n \nData Sheet  AD5243/AD5248  \n \nRev. C | Page 17 of 20 Write Mode  \nTable 9.
