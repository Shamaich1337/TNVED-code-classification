Tslew vs. dvdt Capacitance\nNIS5420 Series\nwww. onsemi.com\n9APPLICATION INFORMATION\nBasic Operation\nThis device is a self −protected, resettable, electronic fuse.\nIt contains circuits to monitor the input voltage, outputvoltage, output current and die temperature.\nOn application of the input voltage, the device will apply\nthe input voltage to the load based on the restrictions of the\ncontrolling circuits. The dv/dt of the output voltage will be\ncontrolled by the internal dv/dt circuit. The output voltagewill slew from 0 V to the rated output voltage in 1.4 ms,unless additional capacitance is added to the dv/dt pin.\nThe device will remain on as long as the temperature does\nnot exceed the 175 °C limit that is programmed into the chip.\nThe current limit circuit does not shut down the part but willreduce the conductivity of the FET to maintain a constant\ncurrent at the internally set current limit level. The input\novervoltage clamp also does not shutdown the part, but will\nlimit the output voltage to 13.5/15 V in the event that theinput exceeds that level.\nAn internal charge pump provides bias for the gate voltage\nof the internal n −channel power FET and also for the current\nlimit circuit. The remainder of the control circuitry operates\nbetween the input voltage (V\nCC) and ground.\nCurrent Limit\nThe current limit circuit uses a SENSEFET along with a\nreference and amplifier to control the peak current in thedevice. The SENSEFET allows for a small fraction of theload current to be measured, which has the advantage of\nreducing the losses in the sense resistor as well as increasing\nthe value and decreasing the power rating of the senseresistor. Sense resistors are typically in the tens of ohmsrange with power ratings of several milliwatts making them\nvery inexpensive chip resistors.\nThe current limit circuit has two limiting values, one for\nshort circuit events which are defined as the mode ofoperation in which the gate is high and the FET is fully\nenhanced. The overload mode of operation occurs when the\ndevice is actively limiting the current and the gate is at anintermediate level. For a more detailed description of thiscircuit please refer to application note AND9441.\nThere are two methods of biasing the current limit circuit\nfor this device. They are shown in the two applicationfigures. Direct current sensing connects the sense resistorbetween the current limit pin and the load. This method\nincludes the bond wire resistance in the current limit circuit.\nThis resistance has an impact on the current limit levels fora given resistor and may vary slightly depending on theimpedance between the sense resistor and the source pins.The on resistance of the device will be slightly lower in thisconfiguration since all five source pins are connected inparallel and therefore, the effective bond wire resistance isone fifth of the resistance for any given pin.\nThe other method is Kelvin sensing. This method uses one\nof the source pins as the connection for the current senseresistor. This connection senses the voltage on the die andtherefore any bond wire resistance and external impedance\non the board have no ef fect on the current limit levels. In this\nconfiguration the on resistance is slightly increased relative\nto the direct sense method since only four of the source pins\nare used for power.\nOvervoltage Clamp\nThe overvoltage clamp consists of an amplifier and\nreference. It monitors the output voltage and if the input\nvoltage exceeds the overvoltage value, the gate drive of the\nmain FET is reduced to limit the output. This is intended toallow operation through transients while protecting the load.\nIf an overvoltage condition exists for many seconds, thedevice may overheat due to the voltage drop across the FET\ncombined with the load current. In this event, the thermalprotection circuit would shut down the device.\nUndervoltage Lockout\nThe undervoltage lockout circuit uses a comparator with\nhysteresis to monitor the input voltage. If the input voltagedrops below the specified level, the output switch will beswitched to a high impedance state.\nOutput Slew Rate dv/dt\nThe dv/dt circuit brings the output voltage up under a\nlinear, controlled rate regardless of the load impedancecharacteristics. An internal ramp generator creates a linearramp, and a control circuit forces the output voltage to\nfollow that ramp, scaled by a factor.\nThe default ramp time is approximately 2 ms. This can be\nmodified by adding an external capacitor at the dv/dt pin.Since the current level is very low, it is important to use aceramic cap or other low leakage capacitor. Aluminumelectrolytic capacitors are not recommended for this circuit.\nThe ramp time from 0 to the nominal output voltage can\nbe determined by the following equation, where t is in\nseconds:\nt1.2−10.8/C00436E7/C0064/C046620 pF /C0041Cext/C0467/C00410.0008\nCext/C0043t1.2−10.8/C00420.0008\n6E7/C004220 pF\nWhere:\nC is in Farads\nt is in seconds\nAny time that the unit shuts down due to a fault, enable\nshut−down, or recycling of input power, the timing capacitor\nwill be discharged and the output voltage will ramp from 0at turn on.\nEnable/Fault\nThe Enable/Fault pin is a multi −function, bidirectional pin\nthat can control the output of the chip as well as sendinformation to other devices regarding the state of the chip.\nWhen this pin is low, the output of the fuse will be turned off.\nWhen this pin is high the output of the fuse will be\nNIS5420 Series\nwww. onsemi.com\n10turned−on. If a thermal fault occurs, this pin will be pulled\nlow to an intermediate level by an internal circuit.\nTo use as a simple enable pin, an open drain or open\ncollector device should be connected to this pin. Due to its\ntri−state operation, it should not be connected to any type of\nlogic with an internal pullup device.\nIf the chip shuts down due to the die temperature reaching\nits thermal limit, this pin will be pulled down to anintermediate level. This signal can be monitored by anexternal circuit to communicate that a thermal shutdown has\noccurred. If this pin is tied to another device in this family,\na thermal shutdown of one device will cause both devices to\ndisable their outputs. Both devices will turn on once the fault\nis removed for the auto −retry devices.\nFor the latching thermal device, the outputs will be\nenabled after the enable pin has been pulled to ground with\nan external switch and then allowed to go high or after theinput power has been recycled. For the auto retry devices,both devices will restart as soon as the die temperature of the\ndevice in shutdown has been reduced to the lower thermallimit.\nThermal Protection\nThe NIS542x includes an internal temperature sensing\ncircuit that senses the temperature on the die of the powerFET. If the temperature reaches 175 °C, the device will shut\ndown, and remove power from the load. Output power can\nbe restored by either recycling the input power or toggling\nthe enable pin for thermally latching devices. Power willautomatically be reapplied to the load for auto −retry devices\nonce the die temperature has been reduced by 45 °C.\nThe thermal limit has been set high intentionally, to\nincrease the trip time during high power transient events. It\nis not recommended to operate this device above 150 °C for\nextended periods of time.\nFigure 17.
