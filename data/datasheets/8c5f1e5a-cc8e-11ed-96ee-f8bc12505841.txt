They provide a voltage output that  \nis linearly proportion al to the Celsius (centigrade) temperature. \nThe TMP35 /TMP36 /TMP3 7 do not require any external \ncalibration to provide typical accuracies of ±1°C at +25°C  \nand ±2°C over the −40°C to +125°C temperature range.  \nThe low output impedance of the TMP35 /TMP36 /TMP37  and \nits linear output and precise calibration simplify interfacing to \ntemperature control circuitry and ADCs . All thre e devices are \nintended for single -supply operation from 2.7 V to 5.5 V maxi -\nmum. The supply current runs well below 50 µA, providing very low self -heating —less than 0.1°C in still air. In addition, a \nshutdown function is provided to cut the supply current to less \nthan 0.5 µA.

The core  \nof the temperature sensor is a band gap core that comprise s \ntransistor s Q1 and Q2, biased by Q3 to appr oximately 8 µ A. The \nband gap core operates both Q1 and Q2 at the same collector \ncurrent level; however, because  the emitter area of Q1 is 10  \ntimes that of Q2, the VBE of Q1 and the VBE of Q2 are not equal \nby the following relationship:  \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n×=∆\nE,Q2E,Q1\nT BEAAV V ln  \nResistors R1 and R2 are used to scale this result to produce the output voltage transfer characteristic of each temperature \nsensor and, simultaneously, R2 and R3 are used to scale the V\nBE of \nQ1 as an offset term in V OUT. Table 4 summarizes the differences  \nin the output characteristics of the three temperature sensors.  \nThe output voltage of the temperature sensor is available at the \nemitter of Q4, which buffers the ban d gap core and provides \nload current drive. The c urrent gain  of Q4 , working with the \navailable base current drive from the previous stage, sets the \nshort -circuit current limit of these devices to 250 µ A.

H | Page 8  of 19 \nData Sheet  TMP35/TMP36/TMP37 \n \nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nSHUTDOWN OPERATION  \nAll TMP35 /TMP36 /TMP37  devices  include a shutd own \ncapability, which reduces the power supply drain to less than \n0.5 µA maximum. This feature, available only in the SOIC_N  \nand the SOT -23 packages, is TTL/CMOS level- compatible, \nprovided that the temperature sensor supply voltage is equal in \nmagnitude to the logic supply voltage. Internal to the TMP35 / \nTMP36 /TMP37  at the SHUTDOWN  pin, a pull -up current \nsource to + VS is connected. This allows the SHUTDOWN  pin to \nbe driven from an open -collector/drain driver. A logic low, or \nzero -volt condition , on the SHUTDOWN  pin is required to \nturn off the output stage. During shutdown, the output of the \ntemperature sensors becomes high impedance where the \npotential of the output pin is  then determined by external \ncircuitry. If the shutdown feature is not used, it is  recommended \nthat the SHUTDOWN  pin be connected to +V S (Pin 8 on the \nSOIC_N ; Pin 2 on th e SOT -23). \nThe shutdown response time of these temperature sensors is \nshown  in Figure 14, Figure 15, and Figure 16.  \nMOUNTING CONSIDERATI ONS  \nIf the TMP35 /TMP36 /TMP37  temperature sensors are t hermally  \nattached and protected,  they can be used in any temperature \nmeasurement application where the maximum temperature range of the mediu m is between − 40°C and +125°C. Properly \ncemented or glued to the surface of t he medi um, these sensors \nare within 0.01 °C of the surface temperature. Caution should be \nexercised, especially with T -3 packages, because the leads and \nany wiring to the device can act as heat pipes, introduci ng \nerrors if the  surrounding air -surface interface is not isothermal. \nAvoiding this condition is easily achieved by dabbing the leads \nof the temper -ature sensor and the hookup wires with a bead of \nthermally conductive epoxy. This ensures that the TMP35 /TMP36 / \nTMP37  die temperature is not affected by the surrounding air \ntemperature. Because plastic IC packaging technology is used, excessive mechanical stress should be avoided when fastening the device with a clamp or a screw -on heat tab. Thermally conductive  \nepoxy or glue, which must be electrically nonconductive, is recommended under typical mounting conditions.  \nThese temp erature sensors, as well as any associated circuitry, \nshould be kept insulated and dry to avoid leakage and corrosion. In wet or corrosive environments, any electrically isolated metal or ceramic well can be used to shield the temperature sensors. Condensa tion at very cold temperatures can cause errors and \nshould be avoided by sealing the device, using electrically non -\nconductive epoxy paints or dip or any one of the many printed \ncircuit board coatings and varnishes.  THERMAL ENVIRONMENT EFFECTS  \nThe thermal  environment in which the TMP35 /TMP36 /TMP37  \nsensors are used det ermines two important characteristics: self -\nheating effects and thermal response time. Figure 23 illustrates a \nthermal model of th e TMP35 /TMP36 /TMP37  temperature \nsensors, which is useful in under -standing these characteristics.  \nTJ θJC TC θCA\nCCH CC PDTA\n00337-021 \nFigure 23. Thermal Circuit Model  \nIn the T -3 package, the thermal resistance junction -to-case, θJC, \nis 120°C/W . The thermal resistance case -to-ambient, C A, is the \ndifference between θ JA and θJC, and is determined by the char -\nacteristics of the thermal conn ection. The p ower dissipation of \nthe temperature sensor , PD, is the product of the total voltage \nacross the device and its total supply current , including any \ncurrent delivered to the load. The rise in die temperature above the ambient temperature of the medium is given by  \nT\nJ = PD × (θJC + θCA) + T A \nThus, the die temperature rise of a TMP35  SOT -23 package \nmounted into a socket in still air at 25°C and driven from a 5 V \nsupply is less than 0.04°C.  \nThe transient response of the TM P35/TMP36 /TMP37  sensors \nto a step change in the temperature is determined by the \nthermal resistances and the thermal capacities of the die, C CH, \nand the case, C C. The thermal capacity of CC varies  with the \nmeasurement medium because  it includes anything in direct \ncontact with the package. In all practical cases, the thermal capacity of C\nC is the limiting factor in the thermal respo nse time \nof the sensor and can be represented by a single- pole RC time \nconstant response. Figure  17 and Figure 19 show  the thermal \nresponse time of the TMP35 /TMP36 /TMP37  sensors under \nvarious conditions. The thermal time constant of  a temperature \nsensor is defined as the time required for the sensor to reach 63.2% of the final value for a step change in the temperatur e. \nFor example, the th ermal time constant of a TMP35  SOIC  \npackage sensor mounted onto a 0. 5" × 0.3" PCB is less than \n50 sec in air, whereas in a stirred oil bath, the time  constant is \nless tha n 3 sec . \nRev.

Basic Temperature Sensor Circuit Configuration  \nNote th e 0.1 µ F bypass capacitor on the input. This capacitor \nshould be a ceramic type,  have very short leads (surface -mount \nis preferable), and be located as close as possible in physical \nproximity to the temperatu re sensor supply pin . Because  these \ntemperature sensors operate on very little supply current and \nmay  be exposed to very ho stile electrical environments, it is \nimportant to minimize the effects of radio frequency interference (RFI) on these devices. The effect of RFI on these temperature \nsensors specifically and on a nalog ICs in general is manifested as  \nabnormal dc shifts in t he output voltage due to the rectification \nof the high frequency ambient noise by the IC. When the \ndevices are operated in the presence of high frequency radiated or conducted noise, a large value tantalum capacitor (±2.2 µ F) \nplaced across the 0.1 µ F ceram ic capacitor may  offer additional \nnoise immunity.  FAHRENHEIT THERMOMET ERS  \nAlthough the TMP35 /TMP36 /TMP37  temperature sensors are \ncentigrade temperature sensors, a few components can be used \nto convert the output voltage and transfer characteristics to \ndirectly read F ahrenheit temperatures.  Figure 25 shows  an \nexample of a simple Fahrenheit thermometer using either the TMP35  or the TMP37 . Using the TMP35 , this circuit can be \nused to sense temperatures from 41°F to 257° F with an output \ntransfer characteri stic of 1 mV/°F ; using the TMP37 , this circuit \ncan be used to sense temperatures from 41°F to 212°F with an \noutput transfer characteristic of 2 mV/°F.  This particular \napproach does not lend itself  to the TMP36  because of its \ninherent 0.5  V output offset. The circuit is constructed with an \nAD589, a 1.23  V voltage reference, and four resistors whose \nvalues for each sensor  are shown in the  table in Figure 25. The \nscaling of the output resistance levels ensure s minimum output \nloading on the temp -eratur e sensors.

In this circuit, the output \nvoltage t ransfer characteristic is 1 mV/ °F but is referenced to \nthe common  ground  of the circuit ; however, there is a 58  mV \n(58°F) offset in the output voltage.

TMP36  Fahrenheit Thermometer Version 1  At the expense of additional circuitry, the offset produced by \nthe circuit in Figure 26 can be avoided by using the circuit in \nFigure 27. In this circuit, the output of the TMP36  is conditioned \nby a single -supply, micropower op amp, the OP193. Although \nthe entire circuit operates from a single 3 V supply, the output \nvoltage of the circuit reads the temperature directly, with a transfer characteristic of 1 mV/°F , without offset.  This is  accom -\nplished through an ADM660, which is a supply voltage inverter. \nThe 3 V supply is inverted and applied to the V − terminal  of the \nOP193 .

The circuits in Figure  28 and \nFigure 29 demonstrate an inexpensive approach to average and \ndifferential temperature measurement.  \nIn Figure  28, a n OP193 sum s the outputs of three temperature \nsensors to produce an output voltage scaled by 10 mV/ °C that \nrepresents the average temperature at three locations. The circuit  \ncan be extended to  include as many temperature sensors as \nrequired as long as the  transfer equation  of the circuit  is \nmaintained. In this application, it is recommended that one \ntemperature sensor type be used throughout the circuit ; \notherwise, the out put voltage of the cir cuit can not produce an \naccurate reading of the various ambient conditions.  \nThe circuit in Figure 29 illustrates how a pair of TMP35 /TMP36 / \nTMP37  sensors used with an OP193 configu red as a difference \namplifier can  read the difference in temperature between two \nlocations. In these applications, it is always possible tha t one \ntemperature sensor is  reading a temperature below that of the \nother sensor. To accommodate this condition, the output of the \nOP193 is offset to a voltage at on e-half the supply via R5 and \nR6. Thus, the output voltage of the circuit is measured relative \nto this point, as shown in  Figure 29. Using the TMP36 , the \noutput voltage of the circuit is scaled b y 10 mV/°C. To minimize \nthe error in t he difference between the two measured \ntemperatures, a common, readily available thin -film resistor \nnetw ork is used for R1 to R4.

With the \npopularity of fas t microprocessor s, the need to indicate a \nmicroprocessor overtemperature condition has grown \ntremendously. The circuit in Figure 30 demonstrates one way to \ngenerate an interrupt using a TMP35 , a CMP402 analog \ncomparator, and a REF191, a 2 V precision voltage reference.  \nThe circuit is  designed to produce a logic high interrupt signal \nif the microprocessor tempera ture exceeds 80°C. This 80°C trip \npoint was arbitrarily chosen (final value set by the microprocessor thermal reference design) and is set using an R3  to R4 volta ge \ndivider of the REF191 output voltage. Because  the output of the \nTMP35  is scaled by 10 mV/°C, the voltage at the inverting \nterminal  of the CMP402 is set to 0.8 V .  Because  temperature is a slowly moving quantity, the possibility \nfor comparator chatter exists. To avoid this condition, hysteresis is used around the c omparator. In this application, a hysteresis \nof 5°C about the trip point was arbitrarily chosen; the ultimate value for hysteresis should be determined by the end application. The output logic voltage swing of the comparator with R1 and R2 determine s the a mount of comparator hysteresis. Using a \n3.3 V supply, the  output logic voltage sw ing of the CMP402 is \n2.6 V; therefore , for a hysteresis of 5° C (50 mV at  10 mV/°C), \nR1 is set to 20 k Ω, and R2 is set to 1 MΩ.

The circuit operates from \na single 3.3 V to 5.5 V supply  and is designed to produce an \noutput voltage transfer characteristic of 10 mV/ °C. \nA Type K thermocouple exhibits a S eebeck coefficient of \napproximately 41 µV/°C; therefore, at the cold junction, the \nTMP35 , with a temperature coefficient of 10 mV/°C, is used \nwith R1 and R2 to introduce an opposing cold -junction temp -\nerature coefficient of − 41 µV/°C. This prevents the isothermal, \ncold-junctio n connection between the PCB  tracks of the circuit and the wires of the thermocouple from introducing an error in \nthe measured temperature. This compensation works extremely \nwell for circuit ambient temperatures in the range of 20 °C to 50 °C. \nOver a 250 °C measurement temperature range, the thermocouple \nproduces an output voltage change of  10.151 m V.  Because  the \nrequired output full -scale voltage  of the circuit  is 2.5 V , the gain \nof the circuit is set to 246.3. Choosing R4 equal to 4.99 k Ω sets \nR5 equal to 1. 22 MΩ. Because  the closest 1% value for R5 is \n1.21 MΩ, a 50 k Ω potentiometer is used with R5 for fine trim of \nthe full -scale output voltage. Although the OP193 is a superior \nsingle -supply, micropower operational amplifier, its output stage  \nis not rail -to-rail; therefore , the 0 °C output voltage level is 0.1 V.  \nIf this circuit is  digitized by a single -supply ADC, the ADC \ncommon should be adjusted to 0.1 V accordingly.  \n \nVOUT+VS\nTMP350.1µF\nGND\nOP1930.1µF\nR11\n24.9kΩR4\n4.99kΩR51\n1.21MΩ\nTYPE K\nTHERMO-\nCOUPLECU\nCU\nR21\n102ΩVOUT\n0V TO 2.5V\nR6\n100kΩ5%R310MΩ\n5%3.3V < +V\nS < 5.5V\nCOLD\nJUNCTIONCHROMEL\nALUMEL\nISOTHERMAL\nBLOCK0°C ≤ T A ≤ 250°C7\n6\n432P1\n50kΩ–\n+–\n+\nNOTE:\n1ALL RESISTORS 1% UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.\n00337-029 \nFigure 31.

These n oise \nsources take many forms,  for example, SCR transients, relays, \nradio transmitters, arc welders, and ac motors. They can  also  \nbe used at considerable distances from the signal conditioning \ncircuitry. These high n oise environments are typically in the \nform of electric fields, so the voltage output of the temperature sensor can be susceptible to contamination from these noise \nsources.  \nFigure 32 illustrates  a way to convert the output voltage of a \nTMP35 /TMP36 /TMP37  sensor into a current to be transmitted \ndown a long twisted  pair shielded cable to a ground referenced \nreceiver. The temperature sensors are not capable of  high out put \ncurrent operation; thus, a standard  PNP transistor is used to \nboost the output current drive of the circuit. As shown in the \ntable  in Figure 32, the values of R2 and R3 were chosen to \nproduce an arbitrary full -scale output current of 2 mA. Lower \nvalues for the full -scale current are not recommended. The \nminimum -scale output current produced by the circuit could be \ncontaminated by ambient magnetic fields operating in the near \nvicinity of the circuit/cable pair. Because the circuit uses  an \nexternal transistor, the minimum recommended operating voltage for this circuit is 5 V .

Remote, 2 -Wire Boosted Output Current Temperature Sensor TEMPERATURE TO 4–20 mA LOOP TRANSMITTER  \nIn many process control applications, 2 -wire transmitters are \nused to convey analog signals through noisy ambient environ -\nments. These current transmitters use a zero -scale signal current \nof 4 mA, which  can be used to power the sign al conditioning \ncircuitry  of the transmitter . The full- scale  output signal in these \ntransmitters is 20 mA. \nFigure 33 illustrates a circuit that transmits temperature inform -\nation in this fashion. Using a TMP35 /TMP36 /TMP37  as the \ntemperature sensor, the output current is linearly proportional \nto the temperature of the medium. The entire circuit operates \nfrom the 3 V outpu t of the REF193. The REF193 requires no \nexternal trimming because of its  tight initial output voltage \ntolerance and the low supply current of  the TMP35 /TMP36 / \nTMP37 , the OP193 , and the REF193. The entire circuit consumes \nless than 3  mA from a total budget of 4 mA . The OP193 regulates  \nthe output current to satisfy the current summation at the noninverting node of the OP193 .

These two trims do \nnot interact because the noninverting input of the OP193 is \nheld at a virtual ground. The zero -scale and full- scale output \ncurrents of the circuit are adjusted ac cording to the operating \ntemperature range of each temperature sensor. The Schottky \ndiode, D1, is required in this circuit to prevent loop supply power -on transients from pulling the noninverting input of the \nOP193 more than 300 mV below its inverting input. Without \nthis diode, such transients can cause phase reversal of the \noperational amplifier and possible latch -up of the transmitter. \nThe loop supply voltage compliance of the circuit is limi ted by \nthe maximum applied  input voltage to the REF193; it  is from \n9 V to 18 V .  \n \nRev.

Temperature to 4–20 mA Loop Transmitter \n \nTEMPERATURE-TO-FRE QUENCY CONVERTER \nAnother common method of transmitting analog information \nfrom a remote location is to convert a voltage to an equivalent value in the frequency domain. This is readily done with any of \nthe low cost, monolithic voltage-to-frequency converters (VFCs) \navailable. These VFCs feature a robust, open-collector output transistor for easy interfacing to digital circuitry. The digital signal produced by the VFC is less susceptible to contamination from external noise sources and line voltage drops because the \nonly important information is the frequency of the digital sig-\nnal. When the conversions between temperature and frequency are done accurately, the temperature data from the sensors can \nbe reliably transmitted.  \nThe circuit in Figure 34 illustrates a method by which the \noutputs of these temperature sensors can be converted to a frequency using the AD654.

Because  the temperature sensor is \nlikely to be used in environments where the ambient noise level \ncan be very high, this resistor helps to prevent rectification by \nthe devices of the high frequency noise. The combination of this \nresistor and  the supply bypass capacitor offers the best protection.  \nTMP3x0.1µF\nGND+VS\n750Ω\nLONG CABLE OR\nHEAVY CAPACITIVE\nLOADSVOUT\n00337-033 \nFigure 35. Driving Long Cables or Heavy Capacitive Loads  COMMENTARY ON LONG -TERM STABILITY  \nThe concept of long -term stability has been used for many years \nto describe the  amount of parameter  shift  that occurs  during \nthe lifetime  of an IC . This is a concept that has been typically \napplied to both voltage references and monolithic temperature \nsensors. Unfor tunately, integrated circuits cannot be evaluated \nat room temp eratur e (25°C) for 10 years or more  to determine \nthis shift. As  a result, manufacturers very typically perform \naccelerated lifetime testing of integrated circuits by operating ICs at elevated temperatures  (between 125 °C and 150°C) over a \nshorter period of time ( typically, between 500 and 1000 hours).  \nAs a result of this operation, the lifetime of an integrated circuit is significantly accelerated due to the increase in rates of reaction  \nwithin the semiconductor material.  \n \n \nRev.
