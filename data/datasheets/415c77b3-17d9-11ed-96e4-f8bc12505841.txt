GENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe W25Q80DV/DL (8M -bit) Serial Flash memory provides a storage solution for systems with limited \nspace, pins and power. The 25Q series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial \nFlash devices. They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM,  executing code directly from D ual/Quad \nSPI (XIP)  and storing voice, text and data. The W25 Q80DV operates on a single 2.7V to 3.6V and the \nW25Q80D L operateds on a single 2.3V to 3.6V  power supply with current consumption as low as 1µA \nfor power -down . \nThe W25Q80DV /DL array is organized into 4,096 programmable pages of 256 -bytes each. Up to 256 \nbytes can be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in  groups of 16 (4KB sector erase), groups \nof 128 (32KB block erase), groups of 256 (64KB block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The \nW25Q80DV /DL has 256 erasable sectors and 16 erasable blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors \nallow for greater flex ibility in applications that require data and parameter storage. (See figure 2.)  \nThe W25Q80DV supports the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), and a high performance \nDual/Quad output as well as Dual/Quad I/O SPI: Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data I/O0 (DI), I/O1 \n(DO), I/O2 (/WP), and I/O3 (/HOLD). SPI clock frequencies of up to 104MHz are supported allowing \nequivalent clock rates of 208MHz (104MHz x 2) for Dual I/O and 416MHz (104MHz x 4) for Quad I/O \nwhen using the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O ins tructions. These transfer rates can outperform standard \nAsynchronous 8 and 16 -bit Parallel Flash memories. A Hold pin, Write Protect pin and programmable \nwrite protect ion, with top, bottom or complement array control,  provide further control flexibility. \nAdditionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device identification with a 64 -bit \nUnique Serial Number.  \n2.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \n \n4.1 Chip Select (/CS)  \nThe SPI Chip Select (/CS) pin enables and disables device operation. When /CS  is high the device is \ndeselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3) pins are at high impedance. When \ndeselected, the devices power consumption wi ll be at standby levels unless an internal erase, \nprogram or write status register cycle is in progress. When /CS  is brought low the device will be \nselected, power consumption will increase to active levels and instructions can be written to and data \nread from the device. After power -up, /CS  must transition from high to low before a new instruction will \nbe accepted. The /CS input must track the VCC supply level at power -up (see “ Power -up Timing and \nWrite inhibit threshold ” and figure 45). If needed , a pull -up resister on /CS can be used to accomplish \nthis. \n4.2 Serial Data Input, Output and IOs (DI, DO and IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3)   \nThe W25Q80DV /DL support standard SPI, Dual SPI and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI \ninstructions use the unidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the \ndevice on the rising edge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidirectional \nDO (output) to read data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \nDual and Quad SPI instructions use the bidirectional IO pins to serially write instructions, addresses or \ndata to the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the device on the falling \nedge of CLK. Quad SPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad Ena ble bit (QE) in Status Register  2 \nto be set. When QE=1, the /WP pin becomes IO2 and /HOLD pin becomes IO3.  \n4.3 Write Protect (/WP)  \nThe Write Protect (/WP) pin can be used to prevent the Status Register from being written. Used in \nconjunction with the Status Register’s Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0)  bits and \nStatus Register Protect  (SRP 0) bits, a portion as small as 4KB  sector or the entire memory array can \nbe hardware protected. The /WP pin is active low. When the QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for \nQuad I/O, the /WP pin function is not available since this pin is used for IO2.  \n4.4 HOLD (/HOLD)  \nThe /HOLD pin allows the d evice to be paused while it is actively selected. When /HOLD is brought \nlow, while /CS  is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals on the DI and CLK pins will be \nignored (don’t care). When /HOLD is brought high, device operation can resume. The /HOLD  function \ncan be useful when multiple devices are sharing the same SPI signals.

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON \n6.1 SPI OPERATIONS  \n6.1.1  Standard SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q80DV/DL  are accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial \nClock (CLK), Chip Select (/CS), Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard SPI \ninstructions use the DI input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the \nrising edge of CLK. The DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on the falling \nedge CLK.  \nSPI bus operation Modes 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 \nand Mode 3 concerns the nor mal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and \ndata is not being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0 the CLK signal is normally low on the \nfalling and rising edges of /CS. For Mode 3 the CLK signal is normally high on the fal ling and rising \nedges of /CS.  \n6.1.2  Dual SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q80DV/DL  support Dual SPI operation when using the “Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh)” and \n“Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh)” instructions. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the \ndevice at two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices. The Dual SPI Read instructions \nare ideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -shadowing) or for execut ing non-\nspeed -critical  code directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Dual SPI instructions, the DI and DO \npins become bidirectional I/O pins: IO0 and IO1.  \n6.1.3  Quad SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q80DV/DL  support Quad  SPI operation when using the “Fast Read Quad  Output (6Bh)”, \n“Fast Read Quad  I/O (EBh)” instructions. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the \ndevice six to eight ti mes the rate of ordinary Serial Flash. The Quad Read instructions offer a \nsignificant improvement in random access transfer rates allowing fast code -shadowing to RAM or \nexecut ion directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Quad SPI instructions the DI and DO pins \nbecome bidirectional IO0 and IO1, and the /WP and /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO3 respectively. \nQuad SPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register  2 to be set.  \n6.1.4  Hold Function  \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI operations , the /HOLD signal allows the  W25Q80DV/DL   operation to \nbe paused while it is actively selected (when /CS is low). The  /HOLD  function may be useful in cases \nwhere the SPI data and clock signals are shared with other devices. For example, consider if the page \nbuffer was only partially written when a priority interrupt requires use of the SPI bus. In this case the  \n/HOLD  function can save the state of the instruction and the data in the buffer so programming can \nresume where it left off once the bus is avail able again.  The /HOLD function is only available for \nstandard SPI and Dual SPI operation, not during Quad SPI.  \n  \n W25Q 80DV /DL\n \nPublication Release Date: October 02, 2015  \n- 12 -                         Prelimry -Revision H  \nTo initiate a  /HOLD  condition, the device must be selected with /CS low. A  /HOLD  condition will \nactivate on the falling edge of the /HOLD signa l if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not \nalready low the  /HOLD  condition will activate after the next falling edge of CLK. The  /HOLD  condition \nwill terminate on the rising edge of the  /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK i s not \nalready low the  /HOLD  condition will terminate after the next falling edge of CLK. During a  /HOLD  \ncondition, the Serial Data Output (DO) is high impedance, and Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Clock \n(CLK) are ignored. The Chip Select (/CS) signal sh ould be kept active low for the full duration of the  \n/HOLD  operation to avoid resetting the internal logic state of the device.  \n6.2 WRITE PROTECTION  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise and \nother adver se system conditions that may compromise data integrity. To address this concern, the \nW25Q80DV/DL  provide several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n6.2.1  Write Protect Features  \n\uf0b7 Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n\uf0b7 Time delay write disable after Power -up \n\uf0b7 Write enable/disable instructions  \n\uf0b7 Automatic write disable after erase or program  \n\uf0b7 Software and Hardware (/WP pin) write protection using Status Register  \n\uf0b7 Write Protection using Power -down instruction  \n\uf0b7 Lock Down write protection until next power -up \n\uf0b7 One Time Program (OTP) write protection* \n* Note:  This feature is available upon special order. Please contact Winbond for details.  \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down, the W25Q80DV/DL   will maintain a reset condition while VCC is \nbelow the threshold v alue of V WI, (See Power -up Timing and Voltage Levels and Figure 45). While \nreset, all operations are disabled and no instructions are recognized. During power -up and after the \nVCC voltage exceeds V WI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled for a time \ndelay of t PUW. This includes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase \nand the Write Status Register instructions. Note that the chip select pin (/CS) must track the VCC \nsupply level at power -up until the VCC -min level and t VSL time delay is reached. If needed , a pull -up \nresister on /CS can be used to accomplish this.  \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Status Register \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Wri te Enable instruction must be issued before a Page \nProgram, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction will be accepted. \nAfter completing a program, erase or write instruction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is automatically \ncleared to a write -disabled state of 0.  \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instruction and setting \nthe Status Register Protect (SRP 0, SRP1 ) and Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0) bits. \nThese settings allow a portion as small as 4KB sector or the entire memory array to be configured as \nread only. Used in conjunction with the Write Protect (/WP) pin, changes to the Status Register can be \nenabled or disabled under hardware control. See Status Reg ister section for further information. \nAdditionally, the Power -down instruction offers an extra level of write protection as all instructions are \nignored except for the Release Power -down instruction.  \n W25Q 80DV /DL\n \nPublication Release Date: October 02, 2015  \n- 13 -                         Prelimry -Revision H  \n7. CONTROL AND STATUS R EGISTERS  \nThe Read Status Register -1 and Status Register -2 instructions can be used to provide status on the \navailability of the Flash memory array, if the device is write enabled or disabled, the state of write \nprotection, Quad SPI setting, Security Register lock status and Erase/Program S uspend status. The \nWrite Status Register instruction can be used to configure the device write protection features, Quad SPI \nsetting and Security Register OTP lock. Write access to the Status Register is controlled by the state of \nthe non-volatile Status R egister Protect bits (SRP 0, SRP1 ), the Write Enable instruction, and during \nStandard/Dual SPI operations, the /WP pin.  \n7.1 STATUS REGISTER  \n7.1.1  BUSY  \nBUSY is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is executing \na Page P rogram, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register \nor Erase/Program Security Register instruction. During this time the device will ignore further \ninstructions except for the Read Status Register and Erase/Program Suspe nd instruction (see t W, tPP, \ntSE, tBE, and t CE in AC Characteristics). When the program, erase or write status/security register \ninstruction has completed, the BUSY bit will be cleared to a 0 state indicating the device is ready for \nfurther instructions.   \n7.1.2  Write Enable Latch (WEL)  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the status register (S1) that is set to 1 after executing a \nWrite Enable Instruction. The WEL status bit is cleared to 0 when the device is write disabled. A write \ndisable state occurs  upon power -up or after any of the following instructions  finished : Write Disable, \nPage Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register, \nErase Security Register and Program Security Register.  \n7.1.3  Block Protect Bits (BP2 , BP1, BP0)  \nThe Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register (S4, S3, \nand S2) that provide Write Protection control and status. Block Protect bits can be set using the Write \nStatus Register Instruction (see t W in AC characteristics). All, none or a portion of the memory array \ncan be protected from Program and Erase instructions (see Status Register Memory Protection table). \nThe factory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of the array protect ed.  \n7.1.4  Top/Bottom Block Protect  (TB) \nThe non -volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect from \nthe Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in the Status Register Memory Protection \ntable. The factory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit c an be set with the Write Status Register \nInstruction depending on the state of the SRP0, SRP1 and WEL bits.  \n7.1.5  Sector /Block  Protect (SEC)   \nThe non -volatile Sector /Block  Protect bit (SEC)  controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) \nprotect either 4KB Sectors (SEC=1) or 64KB Blocks (SEC=0) in the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) \nof the array as shown in the Status Register Memory Protection table. The  default setting is SEC=0.  \n \n W25Q 80DV /DL\n \nPublication Release Date: October 02, 2015  \n- 14 -                         Prelimry -Revision H  \n7.1.6  Complement Protect (CMP)  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volat ile read/write bit in the status register (S14). It is \nused in conjunction with SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits to provide more flexibility for the array \nprotection. Once CMP is set to 1, previous array protection set by SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 will be \nreversed. For instance, when CMP=0, a top 4KB sector can be protected while the rest of the array is \nnot; when CMP=1, the top 4KB sector will become unprotected while the rest of the array become \nread-only. Please refer to the Status Register Memory Protecti on table for details. The  default setting \nis CMP =0. \n7.1.7  Status Register Protect (SRP 1, SRP0) \nThe Status Register Protect bits (SRP 1 and SRP0 ) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status \nregister  (S8 and S7). The SRP bits control the method of write protect ion: software protection, \nhardware protection, power supply lock -down or one time programmable (OTP) protection.  \nSRP1  SRP0  /WP Status  \nRegister  Description  \n0 0 X Software  \nProtection  /WP pin has no control. The Status register can be written to \nafter a Write Enable instruction, WEL=1. [Factory Default]  \n0 1 0 Hardware  \nProtected  When /WP pin is low the Status Register locked and can not \nbe written to.  \n0 1 1 Hardware  \nUnprotected  When /WP pin is high the Status register is unlocked and can \nbe written to after a Write Enable instruction, WEL=1.  \n1 0 X Power Supply  \nLock -Down  Status Register is protected and can not be written to again \nuntil the next power -down, power -up cycle.(1)  \n1 1 X One Time  \nProgram(2) Status Register is permanently protected and can not be \nwritten to.  \nNote:  \n1.  When SRP1, SRP0 = (1, 0), a power -down, power -up cycle will change SRP1, SRP0 to (0, 0) state.  \n2.  This feature is available upon special order. Pleas e contact Winbond for details.  \n7.1.8  Erase/Program Suspend Status (SUS)  \nThe Suspend Status bit is a read only bit in the status register (S15) that is set to 1 after executing a \nErase/Program Suspend (75h) instruction. The SUS status bit is cleared to 0 by Erase/Program \nResume (7Ah) instruction as well as a power -down, power -up cycle.  \n7.1.9  Security Register Lock Bits (LB3, LB2, LB1)  \nThe Security Register Lock Bits (LB3, LB2, LB1) are non -volatile One Time Program (OTP) bits in \nStatus Register (S13, S12, S11) that  provide the write protect control and status to the Security \nRegisters. The default state of LB3 -1 is 0, Security Registers are unlocked. LB3 -1 can be set to 1 \nindividually using the Write Status Register instruction. LB3 -1 are One Time Programmable (OTP) , \nonce it’s set to 1, the corresponding 256 -Byte Security Register will become read -only permanently.  \n  \n W25Q 80DV /DL\n \nPublication Release Date: October 02, 2015  \n- 15 -                         Prelimry -Revision H  \n7.1.10  Quad Enable  (QE) \nThe Quad Enable (QE ) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S 9) that allows Quad \nSPI operation . When the QE bit is set to a 0 state (factory default  for part numbers with ordering \noptions “IG”) , the /WP pin and /HOLD are enabled.

INSTRUCTIONS  \nThe instruction set of the W25Q80DV/DL  consists of 34 basic instructions that are fully controlled \nthrough the SPI bus (see Instruction Set table). Instructions are initiated with the falling edge of Chip \nSelect (/CS). The first byte of data clocked into the DI input provides the instruction co de. Data on the \nDI input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with most significant bit (MSB) first.  \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address bytes, \ndata bytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a combination. Instructions are completed \nwith the rising edge of edge /CS. Clock relative timing diagrams for each instruction are included in \nfigures 4 through 3 9. All read instructions can be completed after any clocked bit. However, all \ninstruct ions that Write, Program or Erase must complete on a byte boundary (/CS driven high after a \nfull 8 -bits have been clocked) otherwise the instruction will be ignored. This feature further protects the \ndevice from inadvertent writes. Additionally, while the memory is being programmed or erased, or \nwhen the Status Register is being written, all instructions except for Read Status Register will be \nignored until the program or erase cycle has completed.  \n8.1 Manufacturer and Device Identification  \nMANUFACTURER ID  (MF7 -MF0)   \nWinbond Serial Flash  EFh \n \nDevice ID  (ID7-ID0) (ID15 -ID0) \nInstruction   ABh, 90h, 92h, 94h  9Fh \nW25Q80DV /DL  13h 4014h  \n \n  \n W25Q 80DV /DL\n \nPublication Release Date: October 02, 2015  \n- 19 -                         Prelimry -Revision H  \n8.2 Instruction Set Table 1 (Standard SPI Instructions)(1) \nINSTRUCTION NAME  BYTE 1  BYTE 2  BYTE 3  BYTE 4  BYTE 5  BYTE 6  \nCLOCK NUMBER  (0 – 7) (8 – 15) (16 – 23) (24 – 31) (32 – 39) (40 – 47) \nWrite Enable  06h  \nVolatile SR Write Enable  50h  \nWrite Disable  04h  \nRead Status Register -1 05h (S7-S0)(2)  \nRead Status Register -2 35h (S15-S8)(2)  \nWrite Status Register  01h (S7-S0) (S15 -S8)  \nPage Program  02h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0 D7-D0(3) \nSector Erase (4KB)  20h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nBlock Erase (32KB)  52h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nBlock Erase (64KB)  D8h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nChip Erase  C7h/60h  \nErase / Program Suspend  75h  \nErase / Program Resume  7Ah  \nPower -down  B9h  \nRead Data  03h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 (D7-D0)  \nFast Read  0Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy  (D7-D0) \nRelease Powerdown / ID(4) ABh dummy  dummy  dummy  (ID7-ID0)(2)  \nManufacturer/Device ID(4) 90h dummy  dummy  00h (MF7 -MF0)  (ID7-ID0) \nJEDEC ID(4) 9Fh (MF7 -MF0) \nManufacturer  (ID15 -ID8)  \nMemory Type  (ID7-ID0)  \nCapacity   \nRead Unique ID  4Bh dummy  dummy  dummy  dummy  (UID63 -UID0)  \nRead SFDP Register  5Ah  A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy  (D7-D0) \nErase  \nSecurity Registers(5) 44h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nProgram  \nSecurity Registers(5) 42h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0 D7-D0(3) \nRead  \nSecurity Registers(5) 48h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy   (D7-D0) \nEnable Reset  66h  \nReset  99h  \n \n \n W25Q 80DV /DL\n \nPublication Release Date: October 02, 2015  \n- 20 -                         Prelimry -Revision H  \n8.3 Instruction Set Table 2 (Dual SPI Instructions)  \nINSTRUCTION NAME  BYTE 1  BYTE 2  BYTE 3  BYTE 4  BYTE 5  BYTE 6  \nCLOCK NUMBER  (0 – 7) (8 – 15) (16 – 23) (24 – 31) (32 – 39) (40 – 47) \nFast Read Dual Output  3Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy  (D7-D0, …)(7) \nFast Read Dual I/O  BBh A23-A8(6) A7-A0, M7 -M0 \n(6)(8) (11) (D7-D0, …)(7)  \nManufacturer/Device ID by \nDual I/O(4) 92h A23-A8(6) A7-A0, M7 -M0 \n(6)(8) (11) (MF7 -MF0, \nID7-ID0)  \n8.4 Instruction Set Table 3 (Quad SPI Instructions)  \nINSTRUCTION NAME  BYTE 1  BYTE 2  BYTE 3  BYTE 4  BYTE 5  BYTE 6  \nCLOCK NUMBER  (0 – 7) (8 – 15) (16 – 23) (24 – 31) (32 – 39) (40 – 47) \nQuad Page Program  32h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0, …(9) D7-D0, …(3) \nFast Read Quad Output  6Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy  (D7-D0, …)(9) \nFast Read Quad I/O  EBh A23-A0, \nM7-M0(8)(11) (xxxx, D7-D0)(10) (D7-D0, …)(9)  \nSet Burst with Wrap  77h xxxxxx,  \nW6-W4(8)  \nManufacture/Device ID by \nQuad I/O(4) 94h A23-A0, \nM7-M0(8)(11) xxxx, (MF7 -MF0, \nID7-ID0) (MF7 -MF0, \nID7-ID0, …)   \nNotes:  \n1.

The WEL bit must be set prior to every Page Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block \nErase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register and Erase/Program Securi ty Registers instruction. The Write \nEnable instruction is entered by driving /CS low, shifting the instruction code “06h” into the Data Input \n(DI) pin on the rising edge of CLK, and then driving /CS high.  \n  \nFigure 4. Write Enable Instruction   \n8.5.2  Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50 h) \nThe non -volatile Status Register bits described in section 7.1 can also be written to as volatile bits. \nThis gives more flexibility to change the system configuration and memory protection schemes quickly \nwithout w aiting for the typical non -volatile bit write cycles or affecting the endurance of the Status \nRegister non -volatile bits. To write the volatile values into the Status Register bits, the Write Enable for \nVolatile Status Register (50h) instruction must be is sued prior to a Write Status Register (01h) \ninstruction. Write Enable for Volatile Status Register instruction (Figure 5) will not set the Write Enable \nLatch (WEL) bit, it is only valid for the Write Status Register instruction to change the volatile Statu s \nRegister bit values.  \n \n \nFigure 5.

The instruction is \nentered by driving /CS low and shifting the instruction code “05h” for Status Register -1 or “35h” for \nStatus Register -2 into the DI pin on the rising edge of CLK. The status register bits are then shifted out \non the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in figure 7. The \nStatus Re gister bits are shown in figure 3a and 3b and include the BUSY, WEL, BP2 -BP0, TB, SEC, \nSRP0, SRP1, QE, LB3 -1, CMP and SUS bits (see Status Register section earlier in this datasheet).  \nThe Read Status Register instruction may be used at any time, even whil e a Program, Erase or Write \nStatus Register cycle is in progress. This allows the BUSY status bit to be checked to determine when \nthe cycle is complete and if the device can accept another instruction. The Status Register can be \nread continuously, as shown  in Figure 7. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high. \n \nFigure 7.

Only non -volatile Status \nRegister bits SRP0, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1, BP0 (bits 7 thru 2 of Status Register -1) and CMP, LB3, LB2, \nLB1, QE, SRP1 (bits 14 thru 8 of Status Register -2) can be written to. All other Status Register bit \nlocations are read -only and will not be affected by the Write Status Register instruction. LB3 -1 are \nnon-volatile OTP bits, once it is set to 1, it cannot be cleared to 0. The Status Register bits are shown \nin figure 3 and described in 7.1  \nTo write non -volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enab le (06h) instruction must previously \nhave been executed for the device to accept the Write Status Register Instruction (Status Register bit \nWEL must equal 1). Once write enabled, the instruction is entered by driving /CS low, sending the \ninstruction code “ 01h”, and then writing the status register data byte as illustrated in figure 8.  \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction must \nhave been executed prior to the Write Status Register instruction (S tatus Register bit WEL remains 0). \nHowever, SRP1 and LB3, LB2, LB1 cannot be changed from “1” to “0” because of the OTP protection \nfor these bits. Upon power off, the volatile Status Register bit values will be lost, and the non -volatile \nStatus Register bi t values will be restored when power on again.  \nTo complete the Write Status Register instruction, the /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth or \nsixteenth bit of data that is clocked in. If this is not done the Write Status Register instruction will n ot \nbe executed. If /CS is driven high after the eighth clock (compatible with the 25X series) the CMP, QE \nand SRP1 bits will be cleared to 0.  \nDuring non -volatile Status Register write operation (06h combined with 01h), after /CS is driven high, \nthe self -timed Write Status Register cycle will commence for a time duration of t W (See AC \nCharacteristics). While the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register \ninstruction may still be accessed to check the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY  bit is a 1 during the \nWrite Status Register cycle and a 0 when the cycle is finished and ready to accept other instructions \nagain. After the Write Status Register cycle has finished, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the \nStatus Register will be cleared to 0. \nDuring volatile Status Register write operation (50h combined with 01h), after /CS is driven high, the \nStatus Register bits will be refreshed to the new values within the time period of t SHSL2  (See AC \nCharacteristics). BUSY bit will remain 0 during the Status Register bit refresh period.  \nPlease refer to 7.1 for detailed Status Register Bit descriptions. Factory default for all status Register \nbits are 0.  \n \nFigure  8.

The code and address bits are latched on the \nrising edge of the CLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory \nlocation will be shifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. \nThe address is automatically incremented to the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted \nout allowing for a continuous stream of data. This means that the entire memory can be acc essed with \na single instruction as long as the clock continues. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nThe Read Data instruction sequence is shown in figure 9. If a Read Data instruction is issued while an \nErase, Program or Write cycle is in pro cess (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any \neffects on the current cycle.

Fast Read Quad I/O Instruction Sequence (M[7:0] =FFh ) \n \nFast Read Quad I/O with “8/16/32/64 -Byte Wrap Around”  \nThe Fast Read Quad I/O instruction can also be used to access a specific portion within a page by \nissuing a “Set Burst with Wrap” command prior to EBh. The “Set Burst with Wrap” command can \neither enable or disable the “Wrap Around” feature for the following EBh commands. When “Wrap \nAround” is enabled,  the data being accessed can be limited to either a 8, 16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a \n256-byte page. The output data starts at the initial address specified in the instruction, once it reaches \nthe ending boundary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, the output will wrap around to the beginning \nboundary automatically until /CS is pulled high to terminate the command.  \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical address and \nthen fill the cache afterwards within a fixe d length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing multiple \nread commands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction allows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be set. The W4 bit is used to \nenable or disable the “Wrap Around” operation while W6 -5 are used to specify t he length of the wrap \naround section within a page.

Certain applications can benefit from this feature and improve the overall system code \nexecution performance.  \nSimilar to a Quad I/O instruction, the Set Burst with Wrap instruction is initiat ed by driving the /CS pin \nlow and then shifting the instruction code “77h” followed by 24 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap Bits”, W7 -0. \nThe instruction sequence is shown in figure 1 5.

To exit \nthe “Wrap Around” function and return to normal read operat ion, another Set Burst with Wrap \ninstruction should be issued to set W4 = 1. The default value of W4 upon power on is 1. In the case of \na system Reset while W4 = 0, it is recommended that the controller issues a Set Burst with Wrap \ninstruction to reset W4 = 1 prior to any normal Read instructions since W25Q80DV/DL  does not have \na hardware Reset Pin.  \n \n Figure 1 5.

A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the \ndevice will accept the Page Program Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1).  The instruction is \ninitiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting the instruction code “02h” followed by a 24 -bit address \n(A23 -A0) and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. The  /CS pin must be held low for the entire length \nof the instruction while data is being sent to the device.  The Page Program instruction sequence is \nshown in figure 19 . \nIf an entire 256 byte page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significa nt address \nbits) should be set to 0. If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks exceed the \nremaining page length, the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page. In some cases, less \nthan 256 bytes (a partial page) can be programm ed without having any effect on other bytes within the \nsame page. One condition to perform a partial page program is that the number of clocks cannot \nexceed the remaining page length. If more than 256 bytes are sent to the device the addressing will \nwrap t o the beginning of the page and overwrite previously sent data.  \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last \nbyte has been latched. If this is not done the Page Program instruction will not be e xecuted. After /CS \nis driven high, the self -timed Page Program instruction will commence for a time duration of tpp (See \nAC Characteristics). While the Page Program cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register \ninstruction may still be accessed for checki ng the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during \nthe Page Program cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept \nother instructions again. After the Page Program cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) b it \nin the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Page Program instruction will not be executed if the \naddressed page is protected by the Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits  (see \nStatus Register Memory Protection table).  \n \nFigure 19 .Page Program Instruction  Sequence Diagram  \n \n\n W25Q 80DV /DL\n \nPublication Release Date: October 02, 2015  \n- 35 -                         Prelimry -Revision H  \n8.5.14  Quad Input Page Program ( 32h)  \nThe Quad Page Program instruction allows up to 256 bytes of data to be programmed at previously \nerased (FFh) memory locations using four pins: IO 0, IO 1, IO 2, and IO 3.  The Quad Page Program can \nimprove performance for PROM Programmer and applications that have slow clock speeds <5MHz. \nSystems with faster clock speed will not realize much benefit for the Quad Page Program instruction \nsince the inherent page program time is much greater  than the time it take to clock -in the data.  \nTo use Quad Page Program the Quad Enable in Status Register -2 must be set (QE=1). A Write \nEnable instruction  must be executed before the device will accept the Quad Page Program instruction \n(Status Register -1, W EL=1). The instruction is initiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting the \ninstruction code “32h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least one data byte, into the IO \npins. The  /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instructio n while data is being sent to \nthe device. All other functions of Quad Page Program are identical to standard Page Program.

The Erase/Program Suspend instruction sequen ce is shown in figure  25. \nThe Write Status Register instruction (01h) and Erase instructions (20h, 52h, D8h, C7h, 60h, 44h) are \nnot allowed during Erase Suspend. Erase Suspend is valid only during the Sector or Block erase \noperation. If written during the Chip Erase operation, the Erase Suspend instruction is ignored. The \nWrite Status Register instruction (01h) and Program instructions (02h, 32h, 42h) are not allowed \nduring Program Suspend. Program Suspend is valid only during the Page Program or Quad Page \nProgram operation.  \nThe Erase/Program Suspend instruction “75h” will be accepted by the device only if the SUS bit in the \nStatus Register equals to 0 and the BUSY bit equals to 1 while a Sector or Block Erase or a Page \nProgram operation is on -going. If the SUS bit equals to 1 or the BUSY bit equals to 0, the Suspend \ninstruction will be ignored by the device. A maximum of time of “t SUS” (See AC Characteristics) is \nrequired to suspend the erase or program operation. The BUSY bit in the Status Register will be \ncleared from 1 to 0 within “t SUS” and the SUS bit in the Status Register will be set from 0 to 1 \nimmediately after Erase/Program Suspend. For a previously resumed Erase/Program operation, it is \nalso required that the Suspend instruction “75h” is not issued  earlier than a minimum of time of “t SUS” \nfollowing the preceding Resume instruction “7Ah”.  \nUnexpected power off during the Erase/Program suspend state will reset the device and release the \nsuspend state. SUS bit in the Status Register will also reset to 0 . The data within the page, sector or \nblock that was being suspended may become corrupted. It is recommended for the user to implement \nsystem design techniques against the accidental power interruption and preserve data integrity during \nerase/program suspe nd state.   \n \n \nFigure 25.

The Resume instruction \n“7Ah” will be accepted by the device only if the SUS bit in the Status  Register equals to 1 and the \nBUSY bit equals to 0. After issued the SUS bit will be cleared from 1 to 0 immediately, the BUSY bit \nwill be set from 0 to 1 within 200ns and the Sector or Block will complete the erase operation or the \npage will complete the program operation. If the SUS bit equals to 0 or the BUSY bit equals to 1, the \nResume instruction “7Ah” will be ignored by the device. The Erase/Program Resume instruction \nsequence is shown in figure 2 6. \nResume instruction is ignored if the previous Erase/ Program Suspend operation was interrupted by \nunexpected power off. It is also required that a subsequent Erase/Program Suspend instruction not to \nbe issued within a minimum of time of “t SUS” following a previous Resume instruction.  \n \n \nFigure 26a.

The lower power consumption makes the Power -down \ninstruction especially useful for battery powered applications (See ICC1 and ICC2 in AC \nCharacteristics). The instruction is initiated  by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code \n“B9h” as shown in figure 2 7.  \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the Power -\ndown instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high , the power -down state will entered \nwithin the time duration of t DP (See AC Characteristics). While in the power -down state only the \nRelease from Power -down / Device ID instruction, which restores the device to normal operation, will \nbe recognized. All oth er instructions are ignored. This includes the Read Status Register instruction, \nwhich is always available during normal operation. Ignoring all but one instruction makes the Power \nDown state a useful condition for securing maximum write protection. The de vice always powers -up in \nthe normal operation with the standby current of ICC1.  \n  \nFigure 27.

It can be used to \nrelease the device from the power -down state , or obtain the devices electronic identification (ID) \nnumber.  \nTo release the device from the power -down state, the instruction is issued by driving the /CS pin low, \nshifting the instr uction code “ABh” and driving /CS high as shown in figure 28a. Release from power -\ndown will take the time duration of t RES1 (See AC Characteristics) before the device will resume \nnormal operation and other instructions are accepted. The /CS pin must remain high during the t RES1 \ntime duration.  \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the power -down state, the instruc tion is initiated \nby driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3 -dummy bytes. The \nDevice ID bits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as \nshown in figure 28a. The Device ID v alues for the W25Q80DV/DL  is listed in Manufacturer and Device \nIdentification table. The Device ID can be read continuously. The instruction is completed by driving \n/CS high.  \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obtain the Device ID, the instruction \nis the same as previously described, and shown in figure 2 8b, except that after /CS is driven high it \nmust remain high for a time duration of t RES2 (See AC Characteristics). After this time duration the \ndevice will resume normal operati on and other instructions will be accepted.  \nIf the Release from Power -down / Device ID instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write \ncycle is in process (when BUSY equals 1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effects on \nthe current cycle. \n \nFigure 28a.

The Read JEDEC ID instruction is compatible with the JEDEC standard for \nSPI compatible serial memories that was adopted in 2003.  \nThe instruction is initiated by driving t he /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “9Fh”. The \nJEDEC assigned Manufacturer ID byte for Winbond (EFh) and two Device ID bytes, Memory Type \n(ID15 -ID8) and Capacity (ID7 -ID0) are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant \nbit (MSB) first as shown in figure 3 3a. For memory type and capacity values refer to Manufacturer and \nDevice Identification table.  \n \nFigure 33a.

The SFDP parameters are stored in one or more Parameter Identification (PID) tables. \nCurrently  only one PID table is specified but more  may be added in the future . The Read SFDP \nRegister instruction is compatible with the SFDP standard  initially established in 2010 for PC and \nother applications. Most Winbond SpiFlash Memories shipped after June 201 1 (date code 1 124 and \nbeyond) support the SFDP feature as specified in the applicable datasheet.  \nThe Read SFDP instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code \n“5Ah” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0)(1) into the DI pin. Eight “dummy” clocks are also required \nbefore the SFDP register contents are shifted out on the falling edge of the 40th CLK with most \nsignificant bit (MSB) first as shown in figure 34b. For SFDP register values and descriptions, please \nrefer to the Winbond Application Note for SFDP Definition Table,  \nNotes:  A23-A8 = 0; A7 -A0 are used to define the starting byte address for the 256 -Byte SFDP Register  \n.  \nFigure 34b.

These registers may be used by the system manufacturers to store security and other \nimportant information separately from the main memory array.  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction is similar to the Sector Erase instruction. A Write Enable \ninstruction must be executed before the device will accept the Erase Security Register Instruction \n(Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is  initiated by driving the /CS pin low and \nshifting the instruction code “44h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) to erase one of the four \nsecurity registers.  \n \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \n \nThe Erase Security Register instruction sequence is shown in figure 3 5. The /CS pin must be driven \nhigh after the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the instruction will not be \nexecuted. After /CS is driven high, the self -timed Erase Security Register operation will commence for \na time duration of t SE (See AC Characteristics). While the Erase Security Register cycle is  in progress, \nthe Read Status Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. \nThe BUSY bit is a 1 during the erase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device \nis ready to accept other instructions aga in. After the Erase Security Register cycle has finished the \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Security Register Lock Bits \n(LB3 -1) in the Status Register -2 can be used to OTP protect the security registers. Once a loc k bit is \nset to 1, the corresponding security register will be permanently locked, Erase Security Register \ninstruction to that register will be ignored (See 8.1.9 for detail descriptions). \n \n Figure 35.

It allows from \none byte to 256 bytes of security register data to be programmed at previously erased  (FFh) memory \nlocations. A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will  accept the Program \nSecurity Register Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the  \n/CS pin low then shifting the instruction code “42h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least \none data byte, into the DI p in. The  /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction \nwhile data is being sent to the device.  \n \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \n \nThe Program Security Register instruction sequence is shown in figure 3 6. The Security Register Lock \nBits (LB3 -1) in the Status Register -2 can be used to OTP protect the security registers. Once a lock bit \nis set to 1, the corresponding security register will be permanently locked, Program Security Register \ninstruction to that register will be ignored (See 8.1.9, 8.2.21 for detail descriptions). \n \nFigure 36.

The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the /CS pin low and then shifting the instruction code “48h”  followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -\nA0) and eight “dumm y” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising \nedge of the CLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location \nwill be shifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most signifi cant bit (MSB) first. The \nbyte address is automatically incremented to the next byte address after each byte of data is shifted \nout. Once the byte address reaches the last byte of the register (byte FFh) , It will reset to 00h, the first \nbyte of the registe r, and continue to increment. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high. The \nRead Security Register instruction sequence is shown in figure  37. If a Read Security Register \ninstruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (B USY=1) the instruction is \nignored and will not have any effects on the current cycle. The Read Security Register instruction \nallows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of F R (see AC Electrical Characteristics).  \n \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \n \n \nFigure 37.

Once the Reset instruction is accepted, \nany on -going internal operations will be terminated and the device will return to its default power -on \nstate and lose all the current volatile settings, such as Volatile Status Registe r bits, Write Enable Latch \n(WEL) status, Program/Erase Suspend status, Read parameter setting (P7 -P0), Wrap Bit setting (W6 -\nW4).  \n“Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” instructions can be issued to avoid accidental reset, both \ninstructions must be issued i n sequence. Any other commands other than  “Reset (99h)” after the \n“Enable Reset (66h)” command will disable the “Reset Enable” state. A new sequence of “Enable \nReset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” is needed to reset the device. Once the Reset command is accepte d \nby the device, the device will take approximately tRST=30us to reset. During this period, no command \nwill be accepted.  \nData corruption may happen if there is an on -going or suspended internal Erase or Program operation \nwhen Reset command sequence is acce pted by the device. It is recommended to check the BUSY bit \nand the SUS bit in Status Register before issuing the Reset command sequence.  \n \nFigure 39a.
