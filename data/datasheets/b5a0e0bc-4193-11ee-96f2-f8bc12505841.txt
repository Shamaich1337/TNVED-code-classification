The output voltage is regulated by aPNP pass transistor controlled by an error amplifier andband gap reference. The choice of a PNP pass element\nprovides the lowest possible dropout voltage, particularly at\nreduced load currents. Pass transistor base drive current iscontrolled to prevent oversaturation. The regulator isinternally protected by both current limit and thermalshutdown. Thermal shutdown occurs when the junctiontemperature exceeds 150 °C. The NCV5500 includes an\nenable/shutdown pin to turn of f the regulator to a low current\ndrain standby state.\nRegulator\nThe error amplifier compares the reference voltage to a\nsample of the output voltage (V out) and drives the base of a\nPNP series pass transistor via a buffer. The reference is abandgap design for enhanced temperature stability.\nSaturation control of the PNP pass transistor is a function of\nthe load current and input voltage. Oversaturation of theoutput power device is prevented, and quiescent current inthe ground pin is minimized.\nRegulator Stability Considerations\nThe input capacitor is necessary to stabilize the input\nimpedance to reduce transient line influences. The outputcapacitor helps determine three main characteristics of alinear regulator: startup delay, load transient response and\nloop stability. The capacitor value and type should be based\non cost, availability, size and temperature constraints. Refer\nto Typical Operating Characteristics for stability regions.\nEnable Input  (NCP5500, NCV5500)\nThe enable pin is used to turn the regulator on or off. By\nholding the pin at a voltage less than 0.4 V, the output of the\nregulator will be turned off to a minimal current drain state.\nWhen the voltage at the Enable pin is greater than 2.0 V, the\noutput of the regulator will be enabled and rise to theregulated output voltage. The Enable pin may be connected\ndirectly to the input pin to provide a constant enable to theregulator.\nActive Load Protection in Shutdown (NCP5500,\nNCV5500)\nWhen a linear regulator is disabled (shutdown), the output\n(load) voltage should be zero. However, stray PC board\nleakage paths, output capacitor dielectric absorption, andinductively coupled power sources can cause an undesirable\nregulator output voltage if load current is low or zero. TheNCV5500 features a load protection network that is activeonly during Shutdown mode. This network switches in a\nshunt current path (~500 /C0109A) from V\nout to Ground. This\nfeature also provides a controlled (“soft”) discharge path for\nthe output capacitor after a transition from Enable to\nShutdown.\nNCP5500, NCV5500, NCP5501, NCV5501\nhttp://onsemi.com\n9Calculating Resistors for the ADJ Versions\nThe adjustable version uses feedback resistors to adjust\nthe output to the desired output voltage. With V out connected\nto ADJ, the adjustable version will regulate at 1.25 V\n/C00064.9% (1250 /C0006 61.25 mV).\nOutput voltage formula with an external resistor divider:\nVout/C0043/C04661.25 V /C0042/C042660E−9/C0064(R1/C0064R2)\n(R1/C0041R2)/C0427/C0467/C0064/C0466(R1/C0041R2)\nR2/C0467\nWhere\nR1 = value of the divider resistor connected between V out\nand ADJ,R\n2 = value of the divider resistor connected between ADJ\nand GND,\nThe term “1.25 V” has a tolerance of /C00064.9%; the term\n“60E−9” can vary in the range 15E −9 to 60E−9.\nFor values of R 2 less than 15 K /C0087, the term within brackets\n( [ ] ) will evaluate to less than 1 mV and can be ignored. Thissimplifies the output voltage formula to:\nV\nout = 1.25 V * ((R1 + R2) / R2)) with a tolerance of /C00064.9%,\nwhich is the tolerance of the 1.25 V output when delivering\nup to 500 mA of output current.\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\nDropout Voltage:  The input −to−output voltage differential\nat which the circuit ceases to regulate against furtherreduction input voltage. Measured when the output voltage\nhas dropped 2% relative to the value measured at nominalinput voltage. Dropout voltage is dependent upon loadcurrent and junction temperature.\nInput Voltage:  The DC voltage applied to the input\nterminals with respect to ground.\nLine Regulation:  The change in output voltage for a change\nin the input voltage. The measurement is made under\nconditions of low dissipation or by using pulse techniques\nsuch that the average chip temperature is not significantlyaffected.\nLoad Regulation:  The change in output voltage for a change\nin load current at constant chip temperature. Pulse loadingtechniques are employed such that the average chip\ntemperature is not significantly affected.\nQuiescent and Ground Current:  The quiescent current is\nthe current which flows through the ground when the LDOoperates without a load on its output: internal IC operation,\nbias, etc. When the LDO becomes loaded, this term is called\nthe Ground current. It is actually the difference between the\ninput current (measured through the LDO input pin) and the\noutput current.Ripple Rejection:  The ratio of the peak −to−peak input ripple\nvoltage to the peak −to−peak output ripple voltage.\nCurrent Limit:  Peak current that can be delivered to the\noutput.\nCalculating Power Dissipation\nThe maximum power dissipation for a single output\nregulator (Figure  21) is:\nPD(max)/C0043/C0426Vin(max)/C0042Vout(min)/C0427Iout(max)/C0041Vin(max)IGND(eq. 1)\nWhere\nVin(max)  is the maximum input voltage,\nVout(min)  is the minimum output voltage,\nIout(max)  is the maximum output current for the application,\nIGND is the ground current at I out(max) .\nOnce the value of P D(max)  is known, the maximum\npermissible value of R /C0113JA can be calculated:\nR/C0113JA/C0043/C0466150 C /C0042TA/C0467\nPD(eq. 2)°\nThe value of R /C0113JA can then be compared with those in the\nThermal Characteristics table. Those packages with R /C0113JA\nless than the calculated value in Equation 2 will keep the die\ntemperature below 150 °C.\nIn some cases, none of the packages will be sufficient to\ndissipate the heat generated by the IC, and an external heatsink will be required.\nHeat Sinks\nA heat sink effectively increases the surface area of the\npackage to improve the flow of heat away from the IC andinto the surrounding air.\nEach material in the heat flow path between the IC and the\noutside environment will have a thermal resistance. Likeseries electrical resistances, these resistances are summed to\ndetermine the value of R\n/C0113JA:\nR/C0113JA/C0043R/C0113JC/C0041R/C0113CS/C0041R/C0113SA (eq. 3)\nwhere\nR/C0113JC is the junction −to−case thermal resistance,\nR/C0113CS is the case −to−heatsink thermal resistance,\nR/C0113SA is the heatsink −to−ambient thermal resistance.\nR/C0113JC appears in the Thermal Characteristics table. Like\nR/C0113JA, it too is a function of package type. R /C0113CS and R /C0113SA are\nfunctions of the package type, heat sink and the interfacebetween them. These values appear in data sheets of heatsink manufacturers.\nThermal, mounting, and heat sink considerations are\nfurther discussed in ON Semiconductor Application Note\nAN1040/D.\nNCP5500, NCV5500, NCP5501, NCV5501\nhttp://onsemi.com\n10ORDERING INFORMATION\nDevice Nominal Output Voltage*Package\nMarking Package Shipping†\nNCP5500DT15RKG\n1.5P5500LG DPAK 5\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCV5500DT15RKG** V5500LG DPAK 5\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCP5501DT15RKG P5501LG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCV5501DT15RKG** V5501LG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCP5501DT15G P5501LG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)75 Units / Rail\nNCV5501DT15G** V5501LG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)75 Units / Rail\nNCP5500DT33RKG\n3.3P5500TG DPAK 5\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCV5500DT33RKG** V5500TG DPAK 5\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCP5501DT33RKG P5501TG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCV5501DT33RKG** V5501TG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCP5501DT33G P5501TG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)75 Units / Rail\nNCV5501DT33G** V5501TG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)75 Units / Rail\nNCP5500DT50RKG\n5.0P5500UG DPAK 5\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCV5500DT50RKG** V5500UG DPAK 5\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCP5501DT50RKG P5501UG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCV5501DT50RKG** V5501UG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCP5501DT50G P5501UG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)75 Units / Rail\nNCV5501DT50G** V5501UG DPAK 3\n(Pb−Free)75 Units / Rail\nNCP5500DTADJRKG\nAdjustableP5500WG DPAK 5\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCV5500DTADJRKG** V5500WG DPAK 5\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCP5500DADJR2GAdjustable5500B SO−8\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\nNCV5500DADJR2G**Adjustable5500A SO−8\n(Pb−Free)2500 / Tape & Reel\n†For information on tape and reel specifications, including part orientation and tape sizes, please refer to our Tape and Reel Packaging\nSpecifications Brochure, BRD8011/D.\n*Contact ON Semiconductor for other fixed voltages.\n**NCV Prefix for Automotive and Other Applications Requiring Unique Site and Control Change Requirements; AEC −Q100 Qualified and PPAP\nCapable\nDPAK−5, CENTER LEAD CROP\nCASE 175AA\nISSUE B\nDATE 15 MAY 2014\nDA\nKB\nR V\nS\nF\nL\nG5 PL\nM 0.13 (0.005) TEC\nU\nJ\nH−T−SEATING\nPLANE\nZDIM MIN MAX MIN MAXMILLIMETERS INCHES\nA 0.235 0.245 5.97 6.22\nB 0.250 0.265 6.35 6.73\nC 0.086 0.094 2.19 2.38\nD 0.020 0.028 0.51 0.71\nE 0.018 0.023 0.46 0.58\nF 0.024 0.032 0.61 0.81\nG 0.180 BSC 4.56 BSC\nH 0.034 0.040 0.87 1.01\nJ0.018 0.023 0.46 0.58\nK 0.102 0.114 2.60 2.89\nL 0.045 BSC 1.14 BSC\nR 0.170 0.190 4.32 4.83\nS 0.025 0.040 0.63 1.01\nU 0.020 −−− 0.51 −−−\nV 0.035 0.050 0.89 1.27\nZ 0.155 0.170 3.93 4.32NOTES:\n1.
