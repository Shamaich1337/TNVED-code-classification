A complete phase- locked loop (PLL) can be \nimplemen ted if the synthesizer is used with an external loop \nfilter and voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). The synthesizer \ncan be used to drive external microwave VCOs via an active \nloop filter. Its  very high bandwidth means a frequency doubler \nstage can be elim inated, simplifying system architecture and \nreducing cost . The ADF41020 is software -compatible with the \nexisting ADF4106/ ADF4107 /ADF4108 family of devices from \nAnalog Devices , Inc . The ir pinout s match  very closely with  \nthe exception of the ADF41020’s single -ended RF input pin, \nmeaning only a minor layout change is required when updating current  design s.  \n \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM  \n \nFigure 1. \n \n CLK\nDATA\nLEREF IN\nRFIN24-BIT INPUT\nREGISTERAVDD DVDD\nCE GND GNDR COUNTER\nR COUNTER\nLATCH\nFUNCTION\nLATCH\nA, B COUNTER\nLATCH\nP/P+ 1N = 4(BP + A)\nA AND B\nM3M2M1MUX\nSDOUTAVDDHIGH-Z\nMUXOUTGND RSET VP\nCPPHASE\nFREQUENCY\nDETECTOR\nLOCK\nDETECTREFERENCE\nCHARGE\nPUMP\nCURRENT\nSETTING 1\nADF41020CPI3 CPI2 CPI1 CPI6 CPI5 CPI4CURRENT\nSETTING 2\n50Ω3pF\nCOUNTERSDIVIDE\nBY 4\n10304-001\n Rev.

Both the normalized phase noise floor and flicker noise are modeled in \nADIsimPLL.  \n6 The phase noise is measured with a Rohde & Schwarz FSUP spectrum analyzer.

C | Page 8 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION \nREFERENCE INPUT SECTION \nThe reference input stage is shown in Figure 9. SW1 and SW2 \nare normally closed switches. SW3 is a normally open switch. \nWhen power-down is initiated, SW3 is closed and SW1 and SW2 are opened. This ensures that there is no loading of the REF\nIN pin on power-down.  \n \nFigure 9. Reference Input Stage \nRF INPUT STAGE \nThe RF input stage is shown in Figure 10. It is followed by a \nbuffer, which generates the differential CML levels needed for \nthe prescaler. \n \nFigure 10. RF Input Stage PRESCALER \nThe ADF41020  uses a two prescaler approach to achieve \noperation up to 18 GHz. The first prescaler is a fixed \ndivide-by-4 block. The second prescaler, which takes its  input from the divide-by-4 output, is implemented as a dual-\nmodulus prescaler (P/P + 1), which allows finer frequency \nresolution vs. a fixed prescaler. Along with the A counter and  B counter, this enables the large division ratio, N, to be realized (N = 4(BP + A)). The dual-modulus prescaler, operating at CML levels, takes the clock from the fixed prescaler stage and divides it down to a manageable frequency for the CMOS A \ncounter and B counter. The second prescaler is programmable. \nIt can be set in software to 8/9, 16/17, 32/33, or 64/65. It is based on a synchronous 4/5 core. There is a minimum divide ratio possible for contiguous output frequencies. This minimum \nis given by 4(P\n2 − P). \nA COUNTER AND B COUNTER \nThe A counter and B counter combine with the two prescalers \nto allow a wide ranging division ratio in the PLL feedback \ncounter. The counters are specified to work when the prescaler \noutput is 350 MHz or less.  \nPulse Swallow Function \nBecause of the fixed divide-by-4 block, the generated output \nfrequencies are spaced by four times the reference frequency \ndivided by R. The equation for VCO frequency is  \n\uf05b\uf05d\nRfA B P fINREF\nVCO\uf0b4\uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf03d4) (  \nwhere: \nfVCO is the output frequency of the external voltage controlled \noscillator (VCO). P is the preset modulus of the dual-modulus prescaler  \n(such as, 8/9, 16/17). B is the preset divide ratio of the binary 13-bit counter  \n(2 to 8191).

Division ratios from 1  to 16,383  \nare allowed.  \nPFD AND CHARGE PUMP  \nThe PFD takes inputs from the R counter and N counter and produces an output proportional to the phase and frequency \ndifference between them. Figure 13 is a simplified schematic. \nThe PFD includes a fixed delay element that controls the  width of the antibacklash pu lse. This pulse ensures that there  \nis no dead zone in the PFD transfer function and minimizes phase noise and reference spurs. The charge pump converts the PFD output to current pulses, which are integrated by the PLL loop filter.  \nMUXOUT AND LOCK DETE CT \nThe output multiplexer on the ADF41 020 allows the user  \nto access various internal points on the chip. The state of MUXOUT is controlled by M3, M2, and M1 in the function \nlatch. Figure 17 shows the full truth table. Figure 12 shows  \nthe MUXOUT section in block diagram form.  \nLock Detect  \nMUXOUT can be programm ed with  digital lo ck detect . \nDigital lock detect is active high. D igital lock detect is set high \nwhen the phase error on five  consecutive phase det ector cycles \nis less than 15  ns. It stays set high until a phase error of greater \nthan 25 ns is detected on any subsequent PD cycle.   \nFigure 12. MUXOUT Circuit  \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER  \nThe ADF41020 digital section includes a 24 -bit input shift \nregister, a 14 -bit R counter, and a 19- bit N counter, comprising  \na 6-bit A counter and a 13 -bit B counter. Data is clocked into \nthe 24 -bit shift register on each rising edge of CLK. The data is \nclocked in MSB first. Data is transferred from the shift register \nto one of three  latches on the rising edge of LE. The destination \nlatch is determined by the state of the two control bits (C2, C1) in the shift register. C2 and C1  are the two LSBs, DB1 and DB0, \nas shown in the timing diagram of  Figure 2. The truth table for \nthese bits is shown in Table 5. Table 5 shows a summary of  \nhow the latches are programmed. The SPI is both 1.8  V and  \n3 V compatible.  \nTable 5.

C | Page 12 of 16 \nData Sheet  ADF41020  \n \nTHE FUNCTION LATCH \nWith C2 and C1 set to  1 and 0, respectively, the on -chip \nfunction latch is programmed. Figure 17 shows the input  \ndata format for programming the function latch.  \nCounter Reset  \nDB2 (F1) is the counter reset bit. When this is 1, the R co unter \nand the N (A, B) counter is  reset. For normal operation, this bit \nshould be 0. When powering up, disable the F1 bit (set to 0). \nThe N counter then resumes counting in close alignment with \nthe R counter. (The maximum error is one prescaler cycle).  \nPow er-Down  \nBit DB3 (PD1) provides a software power -down mode to reduce \nthe overall current drawn by the device. It is enabled by the CE \npin. When the CE pin is low, the device is immediately disabled \nregardless of the state of PD 1. \nIn the programmed software power -down, the device powers \ndown immediately after latching 1  into the PD 1 bit. PD 2 is a \nreserved bit and should be cleared to 0 . \nWhen a power -down is activated, the following events occur:  \n• All active dc current paths in the main synthesizer section \nare removed. However, t he RF divide -by-4 prescaler \nremains active.  \n• The R, N, and timeout counters are forced to their load \nstate conditions.  \n• The charge pump is forced into three -state mode.  \n• The digital clock detect circuitry is reset.  \n• The RF IN input is debiase d. \n• The reference input buffer circuitry is disabled.  \n• The input register remains active and capable of loading and latching data.  \nMUXOUT Control  \nThe on -chip multiplexer is controlled by M3, M2, and M1 on \nthe ADF41020. Figure 17 shows the truth t able.  \nFast  Lock Enable Bit  \nBit DB9 (F4) of the function latch is the fast  lock enable bit. \nWhen this bit is 1, fast  lock is enabled. \nFast  Lock Mode Bit  \nBit DB10 (F5)of the function latch is the fast  lock mode bit. \nWhen fast  lock is enabled, this bit determ ines which fast  lock \nmode is used. If the fast  lock mode bit is 0, then Fast  Lock  \nMode 1 is selected; and if the fast  lock mode bit is 1, then Fast  \nLock Mode  2 is selected.  \nFast  Lock Mode 1  \nThe charge pump current is switched to the contents of Current \nSetting 2. The device enters fast  lock when 1 is written to the CP \ngain bit in the N (A, B) counter latch. The device exits fast  lock \nwhen 0 is written to the CP gain bit in the N (A, B) counter latch.  \n Fast  Lock Mode 2  \nThe charge pump current is switched to  the contents of Current \nSetting 2. The device enters fast  lock when 1 is written to the  \nCP gain bit in the N (A, B) counter latch. The device exits fast  \nlock under the control of the timer counter. After the timeout \nperiod, which is determined by the val ue in TC4 to TC1, the CP \ngain bit in the N (A, B) counter latch is automatically reset to 0, and the device reverts to normal mode instead of fast  lock. See \nFigure 17 for the timeout periods.  \nTimer Counter Control  \nThe user has the option of programming two charge pump currents. The intent is that Current Setting 1 is used when the RF output is stable and the system is in a static state. Current Setting 2 is used when the system is dynamic and in a state of \nchange (t hat is, when a new output frequency is programmed). \nThe normal sequence of events follows.  \nThe user initially decides what the preferred charge pump currents are going to be. For example, the choice may be \n0.85 mA as Current Setting 1 and 1.7  mA as Current  Setting  2. \nSimultaneously, the decision must be made as to how long the secondary current stays active before reverting to the primary current. This is controlled by the timer counter control bits, DB14 to DB11 (TC4 to TC1), in the function latch. The truth table is given in Figure 17. \nTo program a new output freq uency, simply program the N (A, B) \ncounter latch with new values for A and B. Simultaneously, the \nCP gain bit can be set to  1, which sets the charge pump with the \nvalue in CPI6 to CPI4 for a period of time determined by TC4 \nto TC1. When this time is up, the charge pump current reverts \nto the value set by CPI3 to CPI1. At the same time, the CP gain \nbit in the N (A, B) counter latch is reset to 0 and is ready  for the \nnext time the user wishes to change the frequency.  \nNote that there is an enable feature on the timer counter. It is enabled when Fast  Lock Mode 2 is chosen by setting the fast  \nlock mode bit (DB 10) in the function latch to 1 . \nCharge Pump Currents  \nCPI3, CPI2, and CPI1 program Current Setting 1 for the charge pump. CPI6, CPI5, and CPI4 program Current Setting 2 for the charge pump. The truth table is given in Figure 17. \nPrescaler Value  \nP2 and P1 in the functi on latch set the programmable P \nprescaler value. The P value should be chosen so that the prescaler output frequency is always less than or equal to 350 MHz.  \nPD Polarity  \nBit DB7 (F2) sets the phase detector polarity bit. See Figure 17. \nRev. C | Page 13 of 16 \nADF41020  Data Sheet  \n \nCP Three -State  \nBit DB8 (F3) controls the CP output pin. With the bit set high, \nthe CP output is put into three -state. With the bit set low, the \nCP output is enabled.  \nDevice Programming After Initial Power -Up \nAfter initial power up of  the device, there are three methods for \nprogramming the device: function latch, CE pin, and counter \nreset.  \nFunction Latch Method  \n1. Apply V DD. \n2. Program the function latch load (10 in two LSBs of the \ncontrol word), making sure that the F1 bit is programmed  \nto a 0.  \n3. Do an R load (00 in two LSBs).  \n4. Do an N (A, B) load (01 in two LSBs).  \nCE Pin Method  \n1. Apply V DD. \n2. Bring CE low to put the device into power -down. This is an \nasychronous power -down in that it happens immediately.  \n3. Program the function latch (10).  \n4. Program  the R counter latch ( 00). \n5. Program the N (A, B) counter latch (01).  6. Bring CE high to take the device out of power -down. The  \nR and N (A, B) counters now resume counting in close alignment.  \nNote that after CE goes high, a 1 µs duration may be required for the prescaler band gap voltage and oscillator input buffer \nbias to reach steady state.  \nCE can be used to power the device up and down to check  \nfor channel activity. The input register does not need to be reprogrammed each time the device is disabled and en abled  \nas long as it is programmed at least once after V\nDD is initially \napplied.  \nCounter Reset Method  \n1. Apply V DD. \n2. Do a function latch load ( 10 in two LSBs). As part of this, \nload  1 to the F 1 bit. This enables the counter reset.  \n3. Do an R counter load (00 in two LSBs).  \n4. Do an N (A, B) counter load (01  in two LSBs).  \n5. Do a function latch load ( 10 in two LSBs). As part of this, \nload  0 to the F 1 bit. This disables the counter reset. \nThis sequence provides direct control over the internal  \ncounter reset.  \n \nRev. C | Page 14 of 16 \nData Sheet ADF41020\n \nRev. C | Page 15 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nINTERFACING \nThe ADF41020  has a simple 1.8 V and 3 V SPI-compatible \nserial interface for writing to the device. CLK, DATA, and  \nLE control the data transfer. When LE goes high, the 24 bits clocked into the input register on each rising edge of CLK  \nare transferred to the appropriate latch. See Figure 2 for the \ntiming diagram and Table 5 for the latch truth table. \nThe maximum allowable serial clock rate is 20 MHz.  \nADuC7020 Interface \nFigure 18 shows the interface between the ADF41020  and the \nADuC7019 to ADuC7023 family of analog microcontrollers. \nThe ADuC70xx  family is based on an AMR7 core, although the \nsame interface can be used with any 8051-based micro-\ncontroller. The microcontroller is set up for SPI master mode \nwith CPHA = 0. To initiate the operation, the I/O port driving LE is brought low. Each latch of the ADF41020  needs a 24-bit \nword. This is accomplished by writing three 8-bit bytes from the microcontroller to the device. When the third byte is written, bring the LE input high to complete the transfer. \nOn first applying power to the ADF41020 , it needs three writes \n(one each to the function latch, R counter latch, and N counter \nlatch) for the output to become active. \nI/O port lines on the microcontroller are also used to control \npower-down (CE input) and to detect lock (MUXOUT \nconfigured as lock detect and polled by the port input). \nWhen operating in the mode described, the maximum SPI \ntransfer rate of the ADuC7023 is 20 Mbps. This means that  \nthe maximum rate at which the output frequency can be changed is 833 kHz. If using a faster SPI clock, ensure adherence to the SPI timing requirements listed in Table 1. \n \nFigure 18. ADuC70xx -to- ADF41020  Interface \n Blackfin BF527 Interface \nFigure 19 shows the interface between the ADF41020  and  \nthe Blackfin® ADSP-BF527  digital signal processor (DSP). The \nADF41020  needs a 24-bit serial word for each latch write. The \neasiest way to accomplish this using the Blackfin family is to  use the autobuffered transmit mode of operation with alternate framing. This provides a means for transmitting an entire block of serial data before an interrupt is generated. Set up the word \nlength for 8 bits and use three memory locations for each 24-bit \nword. To program each 24-bit latch, store the three 8-bit bytes, enable the autobuffered mode, and write to the transmit register of the DSP . This last operation initiates the autobuffer transfer. As in the microcontroller case, ensure the clock speeds are within the maximum limits outlined in Table 1. \n \nFigure 19. ADSP-BF527 -to- ADF41020  Interface \nPCB DESIGN GUIDELINES \nThe lands on the LFCSP (CP-20) are rectangular. The printed \ncircuit board (PCB) pad for these should be 0.1 mm longer than \nthe package land length and 0.05 mm wider than the package land width. Center the land on the pad to ensure that the solder \njoint size is maximized. The bottom of the LFCSP has a central \nthermal pad. \nThe thermal pad on the PCB should be at least as large as the \nexposed pad. To avoid shorting, on the PCB, provide a clearance of at least 0.25 mm between the thermal pad and the \ninner edges of the pad pattern. \nThermal vias may be used on the PCB thermal pad to improve \nthermal performance of the package. If vias are used, they should be incorporated in the thermal pad at 1.2 mm pitch grid. The \nvia diameter should be between 0.3 mm and 0.33 mm, and plate \nthe via barrel with 1 oz copper to plug the via. \nConnect the PCB thermal pad to GND. \n \n CLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)MOSI\nADF41020SCLOCK\nI/O PORTSADuC70xx\n10304-018CLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)MOSI\nADF41020SCK\nI/O FLAGSADSP-BF527GPIO\n10304-019\nADF41020 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
