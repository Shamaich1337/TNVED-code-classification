The AD5122/ AD5142 are available in a compact , 16-lead, 3 mm ×  \n3 mm LFCSP and a 16 -lead TSSOP . The device s are guaranteed \nto operate over the extended industrial temperature  range of \n−40°C to +125°C.  \nTable  1.

C | Page 20 of 32 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD5122/ AD5142 digital programmable pot entiometers are \ndesigned to operate as true variable resistors for analog signals \nwithin the terminal voltage range of VSS < VTERM < VDD. The resistor  \nwiper position is determined by the RDAC register contents. The  \nRDAC register acts as a scratchpad regist er that allows unlimited  \nchanges of resistance settings. A secondary register (the input \nregister ) can preload the RDAC register data.  \nThe RDAC register can be programmed with any position setting  \nusing the SPI interface (depending on the model). When  a \ndesirable wiper position is found, this value can be stored in the \nEEPROM memory. Thereafter, the wiper position is always \nrestored to that position for subsequent power -ups. The storing \nof EEPROM data takes approximately 1 5 ms; during this time, \nthe de vice is locked and does not acknowledge any new command , \npreventing any changes from taking place. \nRDAC R EGISTER AND EEPROM  \nThe RDAC register directly controls the position of the digital \npotentiometer wiper. For example, when the RDAC register is \nloaded w ith 0x80 ( AD5142, 256 taps), the wiper is connected to \nhalf scale of the variable resistor.  The RDAC register is a standard  \nlogic register; there is no restriction on the number of changes allowed .  \nIt is possible to both write to and read from the RDAC register using the digital interface ( see Table 10). \nThe contents of the RDAC register can be stored to the EEPROM \nusing Command 9 ( see Table 16). Thereafter , the RDAC register \nalways set s at that position for any future on-off-on power \nsupply sequence.  It is possible to read  back data saved into the \nEEPROM  with Command 3 ( see Table 10). \nAlternatively, the EEPROM can be writ ten to independently \nusing Command 1 1 (see Table 16). \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER  \nFor the AD5122/ AD5142, the input shift register is 16 bits wide, \nas shown in  Figure 2. The 16 -bit word consists of four control \nbits, followed by four  address bits and by eight  data bits .  \nIf the AD5122 RDAC or EEPROM  registers are read from or \nwritten to , the lowe st data bit (Bit 0) is  ignored.  \nData is loaded MSB first (Bit 15). The four control bits determine  \nthe function of the software command as listed in  Table 10 and \nTable 16. \n \n \n \n \n SPI SERIAL DATA INTE RFACE  \nThe AD5122/ AD5142 contain a 4 -wire , SPI -compatible digital \ninterface (SDI, SYNC , SDO , and SCLK). The write sequence \nbegins by bringing the SYNC  line low. The SYNC  pin must be \nheld low until the complete data -word is loaded from the SDI \npin. Data is loaded in at the SCLK falling edge transition, as \nshown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. When SYNC  returns high, the \nserial data- word is decode d according to the instructions in \nTable 16. \nTo minimize power consumption in the digital input buffers \nwhen the device  is enable d, operate all serial interface pins close \nto the VLOGIC  supply rails.  \nSYNC  Interruption  \nIn a standalone write sequence for the AD5122/ AD5142, \nthe SYNC  line is kept low for 16 falling edges of SCLK, and the \ninstruction is decoded when SYNC  is pulled high. However, if \nthe SYNC  line is kept low for less than 16 falling edges of SCLK, \nthe input shift register content is ignored , and the write sequence is \nconsidered invalid.  \nSDO Pin \nThe serial data output pin (SDO) serves two purposes : to read  \nback the contents of the  control , EEPROM , RDAC , and input \nregisters using Command 3 (see Table 10 and Table 16), and to \nconnect the AD5122/ AD5142 to daisy -chain mode.  \nThe SDO pin contains an internal open -drain output th at needs an  \nexternal pull -up resistor. Th e SDO pin is enabled when SYNC  is \npulled  low, and t he data is clocked out of SDO on the rising \nedge of SCLK , as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD5122/AD5142  \n \nRev. C | Page 21 of 32 Daisy -Chain Connection  \nDaisy chaining minimizes the number of port pins required from  \nthe controlling IC. As shown in Figure 40, the SDO pin of one \npackage must be  tied to the SDI pin of the next package. The clock  \nperiod can be increase d because of the propagation delay  of the \nline between subsequent devices. When two AD5122/ AD5142 \ndevices are daisy chained, 32 bits of data are required. The first \n16 bits assigned  to U2, and the second 16 bits assigned  to U1, as \nshown in Figure 41. Keep the SYNC  pin low until all 32 bits are \nclocked into their respective serial registers. The SYNC  pin is \nthen pulled high to complete the operation. A typical connection  is \nshow n in Figure 40.  To prevent data from mislocking ( for example, due to noise) the \ndevice  includes an internal counter, if the clock falling edges \ncount is not a multiple of 8, the device  ignores the command . A \nvalid clock count is  16, 24, or 32. The counter resets \nwhen SYNC  returns high.  \n \n \n \n \n \nMOSI\nSS SCLK MISOMICROCONTROLLERSDI SDO\nSCLK SCLKRP2.2kΩRP2.2kΩ\nSDI SDO U1 U2AD5122/\nAD5142AD5122/\nAD5142\nSYNC SYNC\nDAIS Y-CHAINVLOGIC VLOGIC\n10880-039 \nFigure 40.

C | Page 23 of 32 ADVANCED CONTROL MODES  \nThe AD5122/ AD5142 digital potentiometers include a set of user \nprogramming features to address the wide number of  applications \nfor these universal adjustment devices (see Table 16 and Table 18).  \nKey programming features include the following:  \n• Input register  \n• Linear gain setting mode  \n• Low wiper resistance feature \n• Lineal increment and decrement instructions  \n• ±6 dB increment and decrement instructions  \n• Reset  \n• Shutdown mode  \nInput Register  \nThe AD5122/ AD5142 include one input register per RDAC \nregister. These registers allow preloading of the value for the \nassociate d RDAC register. The se register s can be wri tten to using \nCommand 2 and read  back from using Command 3  (see Table 16). \nThis feature allows a synchronous update of one or all the \nRDAC registers at the same time.  \nThe transfer from the input register to the RDAC register is \ndone synchronously by Command 8 (see  Table 16). \nIf new data  is loaded into an RDAC register , this RDAC register  \nautomatically overwrites the associate d input register.  \nLinear Gain Setting  Mode  \nThe proprietary architecture  of the AD5122/ AD5142 allows the \nindependent control of each string resistor, RAW and RWB. To \nenable this feature, use Command 16 (see Table 16) to set B it D2 \nof the control register ( see Table 18). \nThis mode of operation can control the potentiometer as two \nindependent rheostats connected at  a single point,  W terminal,  \nas oppose d to potentiometer mode where each resistor is \ncomplement ary, RAW = RAB − RWB. \nThis feature enables a second input and a n RDAC register per \nchannel, as shown in  Table 17; however,  the actual RDAC content s \nremain unchanged . The same operations are valid for \npotentiometer  mode and linear gain setting  mode . \nIf the INDEP pin is pulled high, t he device  power s up in linear \ngain setting mode and loads the values stored in the associated \nmemory locations for each channel  (see Table 17). The IND EP pin  \nand D2  bit are connected internally to a logic or gate, if any o r \nboth are 1 , the device s cannot operate in potentiometer  mode.  \n \n \n \n  Low Wiper Resistance F eature  \nThe AD5122/ AD5142 include two commands to reduce the wiper  \nresistance between the terminals when the devices  achieve  full scale  \nor zero scale. These ext ra positions  are called bottom scale, BS, and  \ntop scale, TS. The resistance between Terminal A and Terminal W  \nat top scale is specified as RTS. Similar ly, the bottom scale resistance  \nbetween Terminal  B and Terminal W is  specifi ed as RBS. \nThe contents of the RDAC registers are unchanged by entering \nin these positions. There are three ways to exit from top scale and bottom scale: by using Command 12 or Command 13 (see Table 16); by loading new data in a n RDAC register, which \nincludes  increment/decrement operations ; or by entering \nshutdown mode, Command 15 (see Table 16). \nTable 12 and Table 13 show the truth tables for the top scale \nposition and the bottom scale  position , respectively, when the \npotentiometer or linear gain setting  mode is enabled.  \nTable 12.

Bottom Scale Truth Table  \nLinear Gain Setting Mode  Potentiometer Mode  \nRAW RWB RAW RWB \nRTS RBS RAB RBS \n \nLinear Increment and Decrement Instructions  \nThe increment and decrement commands (Command 4 and \nCommand 5  in Table 16) are useful for linear step adjustment \napplications. These commands simplify microcontroller software  \ncoding by allowing the controller to send an increment or \ndecrement command t o the device. The adjustment can be \nindividual or in a ganged potentiometer arrangement, where all wiper positions are changed at the same time.  \nFor an increment command, executing Command 4 automatically  \nmoves the wiper to the next RDAC position. This com mand \ncan be executed in a single channel or multiple channels . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAD5122/AD5142  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 24 of 32 ±6 dB Increment and Decrement Instructions  \nTwo programming instructions produce logarithmic taper \nincrement or decrement of the wiper position control by \nan individual potentiometer  or by a  ganged potentiometer \narrangement where all RDAC register  positions are changed \nsimultaneously . The +6 dB increment is activated by Command  6, \nand the −6 dB decrement is activated by Command 7 (see Table 16). \nFor example, starting with the zero -scale position and  executing  \nCommand 6  ten times  moves the wiper in 6 dB steps to the full -\nscale position . When the wiper position is near the maximum setting , \nthe last 6 dB increment  instruction cause s the wiper to go to the \nfull-scale  position  (see Table 14). \nIncrementing the wiper position by + 6 dB essentially doubles the  \nRDAC register value, whereas decrementing the wiper position by  \n−6 dB halves the register value . Internally, the AD5122/ AD5142 \nuse shift registers to shift the bits left and right to achieve a ±6 dB  \nincrement or decrement. These functions are useful for various audio/video level adjustments, especially for white LED brightness  \nsettings in which human visual responses are more sensitive to large adjustments than to small adjustments.  \nTable 14.

The reset command loads the RDAC register s \nwith the contents of the EEPROM and takes approximately 30 µs. \nThe EEPROM is preloaded to midscale at the factory, and initial \npower -up is, accordingly, at midscale. Tie RESET  to VLOGIC  if \nthe RESET  pin is not used.  Shutdown Mode  \nThe AD5122/ AD5142 can be placed in shutdown mode  by \nexecuting the software shutdown command, Command 15 (see \nTable 16); and by setting the LSB (D0) to 1. This feature places \nthe RDAC in a special state. The contents of the RDAC register are \nunchanged by entering shutdown mode. However, all commands  \nlisted in  Table 16 are supported while in shutdown mode. Execute  \nCommand 15 (see Table 16) and set the LS B (D0) to 0 to exit \nshutdown mode.  \nTable 15.

This can be done by using software . If \nthese registers are  protect ed by software, set Bit D0 and/or Bit D1 \n(see Table 18 ), which protect s the EEPROM and RDAC  registers \nindependently . \nWhen RDAC is protected, the only operation allowed is to copy \nthe EEPROM into the RDAC register . \nINDE P PIN \nIf the INDEP pin is pulled high at power -up, the device  operate s \nin linear gain setting  mode, loading each string resistor, RAWx and \nRWBx, with  the value stored into the EEPROM (see Table 17).

Otherwise, degradation or possible destruction of the internal switch \ncontact can occur. \nPROGRAMMING THE POTENTIOMETER DIVIDER \nVoltage Output Operation \nThe digital potentiometer easily generates a voltage divider at \nwiper to B and wiper to A that is proportional to the input voltage \nat A to B, as shown in Figure 44.  \nWA\nBVA\nVOUT\nVB\n10880-043 \nFigure 44. Potentiometer Mode Configuration  \nC onnecting Ter minal A to 5 V and Terminal B to ground \nproduces an output voltage at the Wiper W to Terminal B ranging from 0 V to 5 V . The general equation defining the output voltage at V\nW with respect to ground for any valid \ninput voltage applied to Terminal A and Terminal B is \nB\nABAW\nA\nABWB\nW VRD RVRD RD V \uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf03d) ( ) () (  (7) \nwhere: \nRWB(D) can be obtained from Equation 1 and Equation 2. \nRAW(D) can be obtained from Equation 3 and Equation 4. \nOperation of the digital potentiometer in the divider mode results in a more accurate operation over temperature. Unlike \nthe rheostat mode, the output voltage is dependent mainly on \nthe ratio of the internal resistors, R\nAW and R WB, and not the \nabsolute values. Therefore, the temperature drift reduces to \n5 ppm/°C.  \nTERMINAL VOLTAGE OPERATING RANGE \nThe AD5122 /AD5142 are designed with internal ESD diodes \nfor protection. These diodes also set the voltage boundary of the \nterminal operating voltages. Positive signals present on Ter minal A, Ter minal B, or Ter minal W that exceed V\nDD are \nclamped by the forward-biased diode. There is no polarity constraint between V\nA, V W, and V B, but they cannot be higher \nthan V DD or lower than V SS. VDD\nA\nW\nB\nVSS\n10880-044 \nFigure 45. Maximum Terminal Voltages Set by V DD and V SS \nPOWER-UP SEQUENCE \nBecause there are diodes to limit the voltage compliance at \nTerminal A, Terminal B, and Terminal W (see Figure 45), it is \nimportant to power up V DD first before applying any voltage to \nTerminal A, Terminal B, and Terminal W . Otherwise, the diode \nis forward-biased such that V DD is powered unintentionally. The \nideal power-up sequence is V SS, V DD, V LOGIC , digital inputs, and \nVA, V B, and V W. The order of powering V A, V B, V W, and digital \ninputs is not important as long as they are powered after V SS, \nVDD, and V LOGIC . Regardless of the power-up sequence and the \nramp rates of the power supplies, once V LOGIC  is powered, the \npower-on preset activates, which restores EEPROM values to \nthe RDAC registers. \nLAYOUT AND POWER SUPPLY BIASING \nIt is always a good practice to use a compact, minimum lead \nlength layout design. Ensure that the leads to the input are as \ndirect as possible with a minimum conductor length. Ground paths must have low resistance and low inductance. It is also good practice to bypass the power supplies with quality capacitors. \nApply low equivalent series resistance (ESR) 1 μF to 10 μF \ntantalum or electrolytic capacitors at the supplies to minimize any transient disturbance and to filter low frequency ripple. Figure 46 illustrates the basic supply bypassing configuration \nfor the AD5122 /AD5142. \nVDD VLOGIC VDD+\nVSSC1\n0.1µFC310µF\n+\nC2\n0.1µFC410µF\nVSSVLOGIC+ C50.1µFC6\n10µF\nAD5122/\nAD5142\nGND\n10880-045 \nFigure 46.
