Then 5 V power provides 3.3 V for the \nmicrocontroller and its peripherals using on -board 3.3 V voltage regulator (U2).  \n5 V pin of J4 or J7 can also be used as an i nput power, so the AT -START -F435  board can be \nsupplied through a 5 V power unit.  \nThe 3.3 V pin of J4, or the VDD of J1 and J2 can  be used as 3.3 V input directly, so  AT-START -\nF435  board can also be supplied  by a 3.3 V power unit. \nNote:  5 V power supply must be pro vided through USB connector (CN6 ) on AT-Link-EZ. Any other \nmethod cannot power the AT -Link-EZ. \nWhen another board is connected to J4, 5 V and 3.3 V can be used output power, J7’s 5V pin as 5 \nV output power, the VDD  pin of J1 and J2  as 3.3 V output power.  \n3.2 IDD \nWhen  JP3 OFF  (symbol IDD) and R17  OFF, an ammeter can be connected to measure the power \nconsumption of AT32F435 ZMT7 . \n\uf06c JP3 OFF , R17 ON:  \nAT32F435 ZMT7  is powered. (Default setting  and JP3 plug is not mounted  before leaving \nfactory )  \n\uf06c JP3 ON , R17 OFF:    \nAT32F435 ZMT7  is powered.  \n\uf06c JP3 OFF , R17 OFF:    \nAn ammeter must be connected . If there is no ammeter  available , the AT32F435 ZMT7  cannot \nbe powered .  \n3.3 Programming  and debugging : embedded AT-Link-EZ \nThe evaluation board integrates  Artery AT-Link-EZ for users to program/debu g the AT32F435 ZMT7  \non the AT -START -F435  board. AT -Link-EZ supports  SWD interface mode , SWO debug,  and a set \nof virtual COM ports (VCP) to connect to the  USART1_TX/USART1_RX  (PA9/PA10 ) of \nAT32F435 ZMT7 .  \nPlease refer to AT-Link User Manua l for complete details on AT-Link-EZ.  \nThe AT -Link-EZ on board can be disassembled or separated from the AT-START -F435 . In this \ncase, the AT-START -F435 can still be connected to the CN7 interface (not mounted before leaving \nfactory) of AT-Link-EZ through CN4 interface (not mounted before leaving factory), or to AT -Link, in \norder to continue to program and debug the AT32F435 ZMT7 . \n \nAT-START -F435  User Manual  \n2023.5.15 10 Rev 1.10 \n3.4 Boot mode selection  \nAt startup, three different boot modes are available for selection through pin configuration.  \nTable 1.

The hardware must be  configured: R2 ON, \nR1 and R3 OFF.  To use PH1 as GPIO, R4 ON can be connected to the pin_24 of J2.  \n\uf06c HSE unused  \nPH0 and PH1  are used as GPIO s. The hardware  must be  configured: R14 and R16 ON, R1 \nand R15  OFF.  \n3.5.2  LEXT  clock source  \nThere are three methods  to configure  the external low-speed clock sources by hardware:  \n\uf06c On-board crystal  (Factory default setting ) \nOn-board 32.768 kHz crystal is used as LEXT clock source. The hardware must be configured: \nR5 and R6 ON, R7 and R8  OFF \n\uf06c External o scillator from PC14  \nExternal oscill ator is injected from the pin_3 of J2. The hardware must be  configured: R7 and \nR8 ON, R5 and R6  OFF.  \n\uf06c LEXT unused  \nPC14 and PC15 are used as GPIO s. The hardware  must be  configured: R7 and R8 ON, R5 \nand R6  OFF.  \n \nAT-START -F435  User Manual  \n2023.5.15 11 Rev 1.10 \n3.6 LEDs \n\uf06c Power  LED1   \nRed LED indicates that the AT -START-F435  is powered by 3.3 V . \n\uf06c User LED2   \nRed LED is  connected to the PD13 pin of AT32F435 ZMT7 .  \n\uf06c User LED3  \nYellow  LED is  connected to the P D14 pin of AT32F435 ZMT7 . \n\uf06c User LED4  \nGreen  LED is  connected to the P D15 pin of AT32F435 ZMT7 . \n3.7 Buttons  \n\uf06c Reset B1 : Reset button  \nIt is connected to NRST to reset  AT32F435 ZMT7  microcontroller.  \n\uf06c User  B2: User button  \nIt is connected to the PA0 of AT32F435 ZMT7  to act as a wakeup button ( R19 ON  and R21 \nOFF), or to the PC13 to acts as TAMPER -RTC button ( R19 OFF  and R21 ON ) \n3.8 OTGFS  configuration  \nAT-START -F435  board supports OTGFS1 and OTGFS2 full -speed/low -speed host or full -speed \ndevice mode via a USB micro -B connector (CN2 or CN3). In device mode, AT32F435 ZMT7  can be \ndirectly connected to the host through USB micro -B, and VBUS1 or VBUS2 can be used as 5 V input of \nAT- START -F435  board. In host mode, an external USB OTG cable is needed to connect to the \nexternal device . The device is powered via USB micro -B interface, which is done by PH3 and PB10 \ncontrolling SI2301 switch.  \nAT-START -F435  board has a USB type -A extension interface (CN1) . This is a OTGFS1 host \ninterface for connecting to U disk and other devices, without the need of USB OTG cable. The USB \ntype-A interface has no power switch control.  \nWhen the PA9 or PA10 of the AT32F435 ZMT7 is used as OTGFS1_VBUS or OTGFS1_ID, the JP4 \njumper must select OTG1. In this case, the PA9 or PA10 is connected to USB micro -B CN2 \ninterface, but disconnected from AT -Link interface (CN4).  \n3.9 QSPI1  interfacing Flash memory  \nOn-board SPI ( EN25QH128A ), connecting to the AT32F435 ZMT7  via QSPI1  interface, is used as \nan extended Flash memory.  \nThe QSPI1  interface is connected to Flash memory with PF6~10  and PG6. If these GPIOs are \nused for other purposes, it is recommended to turn off RP2, R21 and R22 in advance.  \nAT-START -F435  User Manual  \n2023.5.15 12 Rev 1.10 \n3.10 0Ω resistors  \nTable 2. 0Ωresistor settings  \nResistor s State(1) Description  \nR17 \n(MCU power \nconsumption \nmeasurement)  ON When JP3 OFF, 3.3V is connected to the microcontroller \npower to supply microcontroller.  \nOFF When JP3 OFF, 3.3V can be connected to an ammeter to \nmeasure the power consumption of the microcontroller.  \n(The microcontroller cannot be powered without ammeter)  \nR9 \n(VBAT) ON VBAT is connected to VDD  \nOFF VBAT is supplied by the pin_6 (VBAT) of J2.  \nR1, R2, R3, R4 \n(HEXT ) ON, OFF, ON, OFF HEXT  clock source comes from on -board  crystal  Y1 \nOFF, ON, OFF, OFF HEXT  clock source: external oscillator from PH0, PH1 is \nunused.  \nOFF, ON, OFF, ON HEXT  clock source: external oscillator from PH0, PH1 is \nused as GPIO; or PH0, PH1 are used as GPIOs.  \nR5, R6, R7, R8 \n(LEXT ) ON, ON, OFF, OFF LEXT  clock source comes from on -board  crystal X1 \nOFF, OFF, ON, ON LEXT clock source:  external  oscillator from PC14; or PC14, \nPC15 are used as GPIOs.  \nR19, R21 \n(User button B2) ON, OFF User button B2 is connected to PA0. \nOFF, ON User button  B2 is connected to  PC13 . \nR54, R55 \n(PA11 , PA12 ) OFF, OFF As OTGFS1 , PA11 and PA12 are not connected to the \npin_31 and pin_32 of J1.  \nON, ON When PA11 and PA12 are not used as OTGFS1 , they are \nconnected to the pin_31 and pin_32 of J1.  \nR42, R53 \n(PB14 , PB15 ) OFF, OFF As OTGFS2, PB14 and PB15 are not connected to the \npin_3 and pin_4 of J1.  \nON, ON When PB14 an d PB15 are not used as OTGFS2, t hey are \nconnected to the pin_3 and pin_4 of J1.  \nR56, R57, R58, R59 \n(ArduinoTM A4, A5) OFF, ON, OFF, ON ArduinoTM A4 and A5 are connected to ADC123_IN11  and \nADC123_IN10 . \nON, OFF, ON, OFF ArduinoTM A4 and A5 are connected to I2C1_SDA ，\nI2C1_SCL . \nR60, R61 \n(ArduinoTM D10) OFF, ON ArduinoTM D10 is connected to SPI1_CS . \nON, OFF ArduinoTM D10 is connected to PVM ( TMR4_CH1 ). \n(1)  Rx factory default state is shown in BOLD.  \n \nAT-START -F435  User Manual  \n2023.5.15 13 Rev 1.10 \n3.11 Extension connectors  \n3.11.1  ArduinoTM Uno R3  connectors  \nFemale plug J3~J6 and male plug J7 support ArduinoTM Uno R3  connector s.
