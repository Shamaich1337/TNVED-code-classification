ADP1755  with Adjustab le Output Voltage, 0.75 V to 3.3 V \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe ADP1754 /ADP1755 are low dropout  (LDO) CMOS linear \nregulator s that operate from 1.6 V to 3.6 V and provide up to \n1.2  A of output current. These l ow V IN/V OUT LDOs are ideal for  \nregulation of nanometer FPGA geometries operating from 2.5  V \ndown to 1.8  V I/O rails, and for powering core voltages down to \n0.75 V.  Using an advanced proprietary architecture, the ADP1754/ \nADP1755 provide high power supply rejection  ratio (PSRR)  and \nlow nois e, and achieve excellent line and load transient response \nwith only  a small 4.7 µF ceramic output capacitor.  \nThe ADP1754 is available in seven  fixed output voltage options. \nThe ADP1755 is the  adjustable version, which allows output voltages that range from 0.75  V to 3. 3 V via an external divider. \nThe ADP1754 /ADP1755 allow an external soft start capacitor \nto be connec ted to program the start up. A digital power -good \noutput allows power system monitors to check the health of the \noutput voltage.   \nThe ADP1754/ ADP1755 are available in a 16 -lead, 4 mm × 4  mm \nLFCSP , making them not only very compact solutions, but also \nproviding excellent thermal performance for applications that require  up to 1.2 A of output current in a small, low profile \nfootprint.  \n \n Rev.

This is a stress \nrating only; functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is not implied. Exp osure to absolute \nmaximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.  \nTHERMAL D ATA   \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in \ncombination. The ADP17 54/ADP1755 may be damaged if the \njunction temperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient \ntemperature does  not guarantee that T J is within the specified \ntemperature limits. In applica tions with high power dissipation \nand poor thermal resistance , the maximum ambient temperature \nmay need  to be derated. In applications with moderate power \ndissipation and low PCB thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature can exceed the maximum li mit as long  \nas the junction temperature is within specification limits.  \nThe junction temperature (T\nJ) of the device is dependent on the \nambient temperature (T A), the power dissipation of the device \n(PD), and the junction -to-ambient thermal resistance of the \npackage (θ JA). T J is calculated using the following formula : \nTJ = TA + (P D × θJA) Junction -to-ambient thermal resistance (θ JA) of the package is \nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4 -layer board. The \njunction -to-ambient thermal resistance is hig hly dependent  \non the application and board layout. In applications where high \nmaximum  power dissipation exists, close attention to thermal \nboard design is required. The value of θ JA may vary, depending \non PCB material,  layout, and environmental conditions . The \nspecified values of θ JA are based on a 4- layer, 4 in × 3 in circuit \nboard. Refer to JEDEC JESD 51-7 for detailed information about  \nboard construction. For more information, see the AN-772 \nApplication Note, A Design and Manufacturing Guide for the \nLead Frame Chip Scale Package (LFCSP) . \nΨJB is the junction -to-board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of ° C / W.  Ψ JB of the package is based on modeling and \ncalculation using a 4 -layer board.  The JESD51 -12 document , \nGuidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal  \nInformation , states that thermal characterization parameters are \nnot the same as thermal resistances.  ΨJB measures the  component \npower flowing through multiple t hermal paths rather than  through \na single path as in thermal resistance, θ JB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal \npaths include convection from the top of the package as well as \nradiation from the package, factors that make Ψ JB more useful in \nreal-world applications. M aximum junction temperature (T J)  \nis calculated from the board temperature (T B) and the power \ndissipation (P D) using the following formula :  \nTJ = TB + (P D × ΨJB) \nRefer to the JEDEC JESD51 -8 and JESD51 -12 documents for more \ndetailed  information about Ψ JB. \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE  \nθJA and ΨJB are specified for the worst -case conditions, that is, a \ndevice soldered in a circuit board for surface -mount packages.  \nTable 4.

Both  \ndevices operate from a 1.6 V to 3.6  V input rail and provide up \nto 1.2 A  of output current.

ADP1755  Internal Block Diagram \nInternally, the ADP1754/ ADP1755 consist of a reference, an \nerror amplifier, a feedback voltage divider , and a PMOS pass \ntransistor. Output current is delivered via the PMOS pass \ntransistor , which is controlled by the error amplifier. The error \namplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback voltage from the output and amplifies the difference. If the feedback voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the gate  \nof the PMOS devi ce is pulled lower, allowing  more current  \nto pass and increasing  the output voltage. If the feedback \nvoltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing  less current to pass  \nand decreasing  the output volta ge.  The ADP1754 is available in seven  fixed output voltage  options  \nbetween 0. 75 V and 2.5 V . The ADP1754 a llows for con nection \nof an external soft start capacitor  that controls the output \nvoltage ramp during startup. The ADP1755 is the adjustable \nversion with an output voltage  that can be set to a value \nbetween 0. 75 V and 3.3 V by an external voltage d ivider . Both  \ndevices are controlled by an enable  pin (EN).  \nSOFT START  FUNCTION ( ADP1754/ ADP1755) \nFor applications that require a controlled startup, the ADP1754 / \nADP1755 provide a programmable  soft start  function. The \nprogrammable soft start is useful for reducing inrush current \nupon startup and for providing voltag e sequencing. To  implement \nsoft start, connect a small ceramic capacitor fro m SS to GND. \nUpon startup, a 0.9 µA current source char ges this  capacitor. \nThe ADP1754 /ADP1755 start -up output voltage is limited by \nthe voltage  at SS, providing a smooth ramp -up to the nominal \noutput voltage. The soft start  time is calculated as follows: \ntSS = VREF × (CSS/ISS) (1) \nwhere : \ntSS is the soft start  period.  \nVREF is the 0. 5 V reference voltage . \nCSS is the soft start  capacitance from SS to GND . \nISS is the current sourced from SS ( 0.9 µA ). \nWhen the ADP1754/ ADP1755 is disabled  (using the EN pin), the \nsoft start  capacitor is discharged to GND through an internal 100 Ω \nresistor.  \n2.50\n00.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.002.25\n0 2 4 6 8 10VOLTAGE (V)\nTIME (ms)EN\n1nF\n4.7nF\n10nF\n07722-023 \nFigure 26.

V OUT Ramp-Up with Internal Soft Start \nADJUSTABLE OUTPUT VOLTAGE ( ADP1755) \nThe output voltage of the ADP1755  can be set over a 0.75 V to \n3.3 V range. The output voltage is set by connecting a resistive \nvoltage divider from VOUT to ADJ. The output voltage is calcu-\nlated using the following equation: \nVOUT = 0.5 V × (1 + R1 /R2) (2) \nwhere: \nR1 is the resistor from VOUT to ADJ. \nR2 is the resistor from ADJ to GND. \nThe maximum bias current into ADJ is 150 nA. Therefore, to achieve less than 0.5% error due to the bias current, use values \nless than 60 kΩ for R2. \nENABLE FEATURE \nThe ADP1754 /ADP1755  use the EN pin to enable and disable \nthe VOUT pins under normal operating conditions. As shown \nin Figure 28, when a rising voltage on EN crosses the active \nthreshold, VOUT turns on. When a falling voltage on EN crosses \nthe inactive threshold, VOUT turns off. \n2\nCH1  500mVBWCH2  500mVBWM2.0ms A  CH1      1.05V1\nT  29.6%T\n07722-025EN\nVOUT\n500mV/DIVVOUT = 1.5V\nCIN = COUT = 4.7µF\n \nFigure 28. Typical EN Pin Operation As shown in Figure 28, the EN pin has hysteresis built in. This \nhysteresis prevents on/off oscillations that can occur due to \nnoise on the EN pin as it passes through the threshold points.  \nThe EN pin active/inactive thresholds are derived from the VIN \nvoltage. Therefore, these thresholds vary with changing input voltage. Figure 29 shows typical EN active/inactive thresholds when the input voltage varies from 1.6 V to 3.6 V . \n1.1\n0.50.60.70.80.91.0\n1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6EN THRESHOLD (V)\nINPUT VOLTAGE (V)EN ACTIVE\nEN INACTIVE\n07722-026 \nFigure 29. Typical EN Pin Thresholds vs. Input Voltage \nPOWER-GOOD FEATURE \nThe ADP1754 /ADP1755  provide a power-good pin, PG, to \nindicate the status of the output. This open-drain output \nrequires an external pull-up resistor to V IN. If the part is in \nshutdown mode, current-limit mode, thermal shutdown, or  if it falls below 90% of the nominal output voltage, PG imme-\ndiately transitions low. During soft start, the rising threshold of \nthe power-good signal is 93.5% of the nominal output voltage. \nThe open-drain output is held low when the ADP1754/ ADP1755  \nhave sufficient input voltage to turn on the internal PG transistor. \nAn optional soft start delay can be detected. The PG transistor \nis terminated via a pull-up resistor to V\nOUT or V IN.  \nPower-good accuracy is 93.5% of the nominal regulator output \nvoltage when this voltage is rising, with a 90% trip point when \nthis voltage is falling.  \nRegulator input voltage brownouts or glitches trigger a power \nno-good if V OUT falls below 90%. \nA normal power-down triggers a power no-good when V OUT \ndrops below 90%. \nData Sheet ADP1754/ADP1755\n \nRev.

Typical PG Behavior vs. V OUT, V IN Falling (V OUT = 1.5 V) REVERSE CURRENT PROTECTION FEATURE \nThe ADP1754 /ADP1755  have additional circuitry to protect \nagainst reverse current flow from VOUT to VIN. For a typical \nLDO with a PMOS pass device, there is an intrinsic body diode between VIN and VOUT. When V\nIN is greater than V OUT, this \ndiode is reverse-biased. If V OUT is greater than V IN, the intrinsic \ndiode becomes forward-biased and conducts current from VOUT to VIN, potentially causing destructive power dissipation. The reverse current protection circuitry detects when V\nOUT is greater \nthan V IN and reverses the direction of the intrinsic diode connec-\ntion, reverse-biasing the diode. The gate of the PMOS pass device is also connected to VOUT, keeping the device off. \nFigure 32 shows a plot of the reverse current vs. the V\nOUT to V IN \ndifferential. \n4000\n350030002500\n2000\n15001000\n500\n0\n0 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.8 2.1 2.4 2.7 3.0 3.3 3.6REVERSE CURRENT (µA)\nVOUT – VIN (V)\n07722-132 \nFigure 32.

G | Page 14 of 20 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nOutput Capacitor \nThe ADP1754 /ADP1755  are designed for operation with small, \nspace-saving ceramic capacitors, but they can function with most \ncommonly used capacitors as long as care is taken with the effective series resistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the stability of the LDO control loop. A mini-\nmum of 3.3 μF capacitance with an ESR of 500 mΩ or less is \nrecommended to ensure the stability of the ADP1754 /ADP1755 . \nTransient response to changes in load current is also affected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient response of the ADP1754 /ADP1755  to \nlarge changes in load current. Figure 33 and Figure 34 show the \ntransient responses for output capacitance values of 4.7 μF and  \n22 μF, respectively. \n1\n2T\nCH1  500mABWCH2  50mVBWM1µs A  CH1     380mA\nT  11.2%ILOAD\n1mA TO 1.2A LOAD STEP, 2.5A/µs, 500mA/DIV\nVOUT\n50mV/DIV\nVIN = 3.6V, VOUT = 1.5V\nCIN = COUT = 4.7µF\n07722-133 \nFigure 33.

Output Transient Response, C OUT = 22 μF Input Bypass Capacitor \nConnecting a 4.7 μF capacitor from the VIN pin to GND \nreduces the circuit sensitivity to printed circuit board (PCB) \nlayout, especially when long input traces or high source \nimpedance are encountered. If output capacitance greater than 4.7 μF is required, it is recommended that the input capacitor be \nincreased to match it. \nInput and Output Capacitor Properties \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the \nADP1754 , as long as they meet the minimum capacitance and \nmaximum ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufac-\ntured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have a \ndielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over the \nnecessary temperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of 6.3 V or 10 V are recom-mended. Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are not recommended, due \nto their poor temperature and dc bias characteristics.  \nFigure 35 shows the capacitance vs. voltage bias characteristics \nof an 0805 case, 4.7 μF, 10 V , X5R capacitor. The voltage stability \nof a capacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and \nvoltage rating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or with a higher voltage rating exhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the X5R dielectric is about ±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range and is not a function of package size \nor voltage rating. \n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n02468 1 0CAPACITANCE (µF)\nVOLTAGE BIAS (V)\n07722-031MURATA P/N GRM219R61A475KE34\n \nFigure 35. Capacitance vs. Voltage Bias Characteristics \nEquation 3 can be used to determine the worst-case capacitance, \naccounting for capacitor variation over temperature, component \ntolerance, and voltage. \nCEFF = COUT × (1 − TEMPCO ) × (1 − TOL) (3) \nwhere: \nCEFF is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage. \nTEMPCO  is the worst-case capacitor temperature coefficient. \nTOL  is the worst-case component tolerance. \nData Sheet ADP1754/ADP1755 \n \nIn this example, the worst -case temperature coefficient \n(TEMPCO) over −40°C to +85°C is assumed to be 15% for an \nX5R dielectric. The tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed \nto be 10%, and C OUT = 4.46 μF at 1.8 V , as shown in Figure 35. \nSubstituting these values in Equation 3 yields  \nCEFF = 4.46 μF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 3.41 μF  \nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the \nminimum capa citance requirement of the LDO over temper -\nature and tolerance at the chosen output voltage. \nTo guarantee the performance of the ADP1754/ ADP1755, it is \nimperative that the effects of dc bias, temperature , and toler -\nances on the behavior of the capacitors be  evaluated for each \napplication.  \nUNDERVOLTAGE  LOCKOUT  \nThe ADP1754 /ADP1755 have  an internal undervoltage lockout \ncircuit that disables all inputs and the output when the input \nvoltage is less than approximately 1.58 V.  This ensures that the \nADP1754/ ADP1755 inputs and the output behave in a predicta -\nble manner during power -up. \nCURREN T-LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLO AD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADP1754 /ADP1755 are protected against damage due to \nexcessive power dissipation by current -limit  and thermal \noverload protection circuits . The ADP1754/ ADP1755 are \ndesigned to reach current limit when the output load reaches \n2 A (typical).  When the output load exceeds 2 A, the output \nvoltage is reduced to  maintain a constant current limit.  \nThermal overload protection is included , which limits the \njunction  temperature to a maximum of 150°C  (typical) . Under \nextreme conditions  (that is, high ambient temperature and \npower dissipation) when  the junction  temperature begins  to  \nrise above 150°C, the output is turned off , reduc ing the output \ncurrent to zero. When the junction temperature drops below \n135°C  (typical) , the output is tu rned on again and the output \ncurrent is restored to its nominal value . \nConsider the case where a hard  short from V OUT to ground \noccurs. At first , the ADP1754/ ADP1755 reach current limit so \nthat only 2 A is conducted into the short. If sel f-heating of the \njunction becomes  great enough to cause its temperature to  \nrise above 150°C , thermal shutdown  activ ates, turning off the \noutput and reducing the output current to zero. As the junction  \ntempera ture cools and drops below 135°C, the output turn s on \nand conduct s 2 A into the short, again caus ing the junction \ntemperature to rise above 150°C. This  thermal oscillation  between \n135°C  and 150°C cause s a current oscillation between 2 A and \n0 A that continue s as long as the short remains at the output.  \nCurrent -limit  and thermal overload  protections are intended to \nprotect the device against accidenta l overload conditions. For \nreliable  operation, device power dissipation should be  externally \nlimited so that junction temperatures do  not exceed 125°C.  THERMAL CONSIDERATIONS  \nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the \nADP1754/ ADP1755 must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the \njunction temperature stays below this maximum value, the user \nneeds to be aware of the parameters that contribute to junction \ntemperature changes. These parameters include ambient temp -\nerature, power dissipation in the power device, and thermal \nresistance between the junction and ambient air (θ JA). The θ JA \nvalue is dependent on the package assembly compounds used and the  amount of copper to which the GND pin  and the exposed \npad (EP AD) of the package are soldered on the PCB. Table 6  sh\nows \ntypical θ JA values for the 16 -lead LFCSP for various PCB copper \nsizes. Table 7 shows  typical Ψ JB value s for the 16 -lead LFCSP .  \nTable 6.

Therefore, the junction temperature equation can \nbe simplified as follows: \nT\nJ = TA + {[( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD] × θJA} (6) \nAs shown in Equation 6, for a given ambient temperature, input -\nto-output voltage differential, and continuous load current, a \nminimum copper size requirement exists for the PCB to ensure that the junction temperature does not rise  above 125°C.  \nFigure 36 through Figure 41 show junction temperature \ncalculations for different ambient temperatures, load currents, V\nIN to V OUT differentials, and areas of PCB copper. \nRev.
