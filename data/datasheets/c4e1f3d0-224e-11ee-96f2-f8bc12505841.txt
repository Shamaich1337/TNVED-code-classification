Low \npower consumption, coupled with a shutdown mode, makes it \nideal for power-sensitive applications. The ADM3493 is suitable \nfor communication on multipoint bus transmission lines.  \nThe device contains one driver and one receiver. Designed for \nhalf-duplex communication, the ADM3493 features a slew rate \nlimited driver that minimizes EMI and reduces reflections \ncaused by improperly terminated cables, allowing error-free \ndata transmission at data rates up to 250 kbps.  The receiver input impedance is 96 kΩ, allowing up to 256 \ntransceivers to be connected on the bus. A thermal shutdown \ncircuit prevents excessive power dissipation caused by bus \ncontention or by output shorting. If a significant temperature \nincrease is detected in the internal driver circuitry during fault conditions then the thermal shutdown circuit forces the driver output into a high impedance state. The receiver contains a fail-safe feature that results in a logic high output state, if the inputs \nare unconnected (floating). \nThe ADM3493 is fully specified over the commercial and \nindustrial temperature ranges and is available in an 8-lead SOIC. \n \n \n \n \nADM3493  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 2 of 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nFeatures

The ADM3493 can transmit and \nreceive at data rates up to 250 kbps in a half duplex \nconfiguration. Driver Enable (DE) and Receiver Enable ( RE) \npins are included when disabled; the driver and receiver \noutputs are high impedance. \nTable 5.

LOW POWER SHUTDOWN MODE \nA low power shutdown mode is initiated by bringing both RE \nhigh and DE low. The ADM3493 does not shut down unless \nboth the driver and receiver are disabled (high impedance). In shutdown, the ADM3493 typically draws only 2 nA of supply current. For the ADM3493, the t\nPSH and t PSL enable times assume \nthe part was in the low power shutdown mode; the t PZH and t PZL \nenable times assume the receiver or driver was disabled, but the part was not shut down. \nDRIVER OUTPUT PROTECTION \nTwo methods are implemented to prevent excessive output \ncurrent and power dissipation caused by faults or by bus \ncontention. Current limit protection on the output stage provides immediate protection against short circuits over the whole common-mode voltage range (see \nTypical Performance \nCharacteristics ). In addition, a thermal shutdown circuit forces \nthe driver outputs into a high impedance state if the die temperature rises excessively. \nPROPAGATION DELAY \nSkew time is simply the difference between the low-to-high and high-to-low propagation delay. Small driver/receiver skew times \nhelp maintain a symmetrical mark-space ratio (50% duty cycle). \nThe receiver skew time, |t PRLH - t PRHL|, is 20 ns for the ADM3493. \nThe driver skew time is typically under 100 ns. \nTYPICAL APPLICATIONS \nThe ADM3493 transceiver is designed for bidirectional data communications on multipoint bus transmission lines. Figure \n22 shows a typical network application’s circuits. To minimize reflections, the line should be terminated at both ends in its characteristic impedance, and stub lengths off the main line should be kept as short as possible. The slew rate limited \nADM3493 is tolerant of imperfect termination. \n \nBAR\nDRO\nRE\nDIDEADM3493 ADM3493\nADM3493 ADM3493BAR\nDRO\nRE\nDIDE\nB A\nR\nD\nRO RE DI DEB A\nR\nD\nRO RE DI DE\n05715-028MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TRANSCEI VERS ON BUS = 256\nRT RT\nNOTES\n1.

### Component Summary: ADM3493ARZ-REEL7

**Description:**
The ADM3493 is a low-power, half-duplex RS-485/RS-422 transceiver designed to operate with a single 3.3 V power supply. It is suitable for multipoint bus communication and features a slew rate limited driver to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI) and reflections from improperly terminated cables. The device includes one driver and one receiver, allowing for data transmission rates of up to 250 kbps.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VCC): 3.3 V ± 0.3 V
  - Common-Mode Voltage Range: -7 V to +12 V
  - Driver Output/Receiver Input Voltage: -7.5 V to +12.5 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Supply Current (Active): 1.1 mA (typical)
  - Supply Current in Shutdown Mode: 2 nA (typical)
  - Driver Short-Circuit Output Current: ±250 mA
  - Receiver Short-Circuit Output Current: ±60 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Typical supply current in active mode: 1.1 mA
  - Shutdown current: 2 nA

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40°C to +85°C

- **Package Type:**
  - 8-lead Standard Small Outline Package (SOIC)

- **Special Features:**
  - Interoperable with 5 V logic
  - Thermal shutdown protection
  - Fail-safe receiver output state when inputs are unconnected
  - Up to 256 transceivers can be connected on a single bus
  - Reduced slew rates for low EMI

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level: 1 (JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The ADM3493 is commonly used in:
- Low power RS-485 applications
- EMI sensitive systems
- Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) to Data Communication Equipment (DCE) interfaces
- Industrial control systems
- Packet switching networks
- Local area networks (LANs)
- Level translation applications

This transceiver is ideal for applications requiring reliable data communication over long distances while maintaining low power consumption and minimizing interference.
