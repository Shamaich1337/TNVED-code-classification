Pin Functions\nPIN TYPE\n(1) DESCRIPTION\nNAME NO.\nCOMP 1 OThis pin provides the output of the error amplifier for compensation. In addition, the COMP pin is frequently \nused as a control port, by utilizing a secondary-side error amplifier to send an error signal across the \nsecondary-primary isolation boundary through an opto-isolator. The error amplifier is internally current limited \nso the user can command zero duty cycle by externally forcing COMP to GND.\nCS 3 IPrimary-side current sense pin. The current sense pin is the noninverting input to the PWM comparator. \nConnect to current sensing resistor. This signal is compared to a signal proportional to the error amplifier \noutput voltage. The PWM uses this to terminate the OUT switch conduction. A voltage ramp can be applied to \nthis pin to run the device with a voltage mode control configuration.\nFB 2 IThis pin is the inverting input to the error amplifier. FB is used to control the power converter voltage-feedback \nloop for stability. The noninverting input to the error amplifier is internally trimmed to 2.5 V ± 1%.\nGND 5 — Ground return pin for the output driver stage and the logic level controller section.\nOUT 6 OThe output of the on-chip drive stage. OUT is intended to directly drive a MOSFET. The OUT pin in the \nUCCx8C40, UCCx8C42, and UCCx8C43  is the same frequency as the oscillator, and can operate near 100% \nduty cycle. In the UCCx8C41, UCCx8C44, and UCCx8C45,  the frequency of OUT is one-half that of the \noscillator due to an internal T flipflop. This limits the maximum duty cycle to < 50%. Peak currents of up to 1 A \nare sourced and sunk by this pin. OUT is actively held low when VDD is below the turn-on threshold.\nRT/CT 4 I/OFixed frequency oscillator set point. Connect timing resistor (R RT) to VREF and timing capacitor (C CT) to GND \nfrom this pin to set the switching frequency. For best performance, keep the timing capacitor lead to the device \nGND as short and direct as possible. If possible, use separate ground traces for the timing capacitor and all \nother functions. The switching frequency (f SW) of the UCCx8C40, UCCx8C42, and UCCx8C43 gate drive is \nequal to f OSC; the switching frequency of the UCCx8C41, UCCx8C44, and UCCx8C45 is equal to half of the \nfOSC.\nVDD 7 IAnalog controller bias input that provides power to the device. Total VDD current is the sum of the quiescent \nVDD current and the average OUT current. A bypass capacitor, typically 0.1 µF, connected directly to GND \nwith minimal trace length, is required on this pin. Additional capacitance at least 10 times greater than the gate \ncapacitance of the main switching FET used in the design is also required on VDD.\nVREF 8 O5-V reference voltage. VREF is used to provide charging current to the oscillator timing capacitor through the \ntiming resistor. It is important for reference stability that VREF is bypassed to GND with a ceramic capacitor \nconnected as close to the pin as possible. A minimum value of 0.1 µF ceramic is required. Additional VREF \nbypassing is required for external loads on VREF.\n(1) I = input, O = output, G = groundUCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n4 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\n7 Specifications\n7.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings\nOver operating free-air temperature range (unless otherwise noted) (1) (2)\nMIN MAX UNIT\nInput voltage VDD 20 V\nInput current IVDD 30 mA\nOutput drive current (peak) ±1 A\nOutput energy (capacitive load), E OUT 5 µJ\nAnalog input voltage COMP, CS, FB, RT/CT –0.3 6.3\nV Output driver voltage OUT –0.3 20\nReference voltage VREF 7\nError amplifier output sink current COMP 10 mA\nTotal power dissipation at T A = 25°CD package 72.3\n°C/W\nDGK package 98.1\nLead temperature (soldering, 10 s), T LEAD 300 °C\nOperating junction temperature, T J –55 150 °C\nStorage temperature, T stg –65 150 °C\n(1) Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings  may cause permanent damage to the device.

Internally implemented circuits \ninclude a start-up current of less than 100 μA, a precision reference trimmed for accuracy at the error \namplifier input, logic to ensure latched operation, a pulse-width modulation (PWM) comparator that also provides \ncurrentlimit control, and an output stage designed to source or sink high-peak current. The output stage, suitable \nfor driving N-channel MOSFETs, is low when it is in the OFF state. The oscillator contains a trimmed discharge \ncurrent that enables accurate programming of the maximum duty cycle and dead time limit, making this device \nsuitable for high-speed applications.\nMajor differences between members of this series are the UVLO thresholds, acceptable ambient temperature \nrange, and maximum duty cycle. Typical UVLO thresholds of 14.5 V (ON) and 9 V (OFF) on the UCCx8C42 \nand UCCx8C44 devices make them ideally suited to off-line AC-DC applications. The corresponding typical \nthresholds for the UCCx8C43 and UCCx8C45 devices are 8.4 V (ON) and 7.6 V (OFF), making them ideal \nfor use with regulated input voltages used in DC-DC applications. The UCCx8C40 and UCCx8C41 feature a \nstart-up threshold of 7 V and a turnoff threshold of 6.6 V (OFF), which makes them suitable for battery-powered \napplications. The UCCx8C40, UCCx8C42, and UCCx8C43 devices operate to duty cycles approaching 100%. \nThe UCCx8C41, UCCx8C44, and UCCx8C45 obtain a duty cycle from 0% to 50% by the addition of an internal \ntoggle flip-flop, which blanks the output off every other clock cycle. The UCC28C4x series is specified for \noperation from –40°C to 125°C, and the UCC38C4x series is specified for operation from 0°C to 85°C.\nThe UCC28C4x and UCC38C4x series are an enhanced replacement with pin-to-pin compatibility to the bipolar \nUC284x, UC384x, UC284xA, and UC384xA families. The new series offers improved performance when \ncompared to older bipolar devices and other competitive BiCMOS devices with similar functionality. These \nimprovements generally consist of tighter specification limits that are a subset of the older product ratings, \nmaintaining drop-in capability. In new designs, these improvements can reduce the component count or enhance \ncircuit performance when compared to the previously available devices.UCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVREF EN\nVREF Good \nLogicUVLO\nOsc\nS\nRPWM \nLatchR 1 V+\nE/AVDD\nRT/CT\nFB\nCOMP\nCSPWM \nComparatorVREF\nOUT\nGND2RT\n2.5 V( NOTE )5 V\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nToggle flip-flop used only in UCCx8C41, UCCx8C44, and UCCx8C45\n8.3 Feature Description\nThe BiCMOS design allows operation at high frequencies that were not feasible in the predecessor bipolar \ndevices. First, the output stage has been redesigned to drive the external power switch in approximately half \nthe time of the earlier devices. Second, the internal oscillator is more robust, with less variation as frequency \nincreases. This faster oscillator makes this device suitable for high speed applications and the trimmed \ndischarge current enables precise programming of the maximum duty cycle and dead-time limit. In addition, \nthe current sense to output delay is kept the same 45 ns (typical) . Such a delay time in the current sense results \nin superior overload protection at the power switch. The reduced start-up current of this device minimizes steady \nstate power dissipation in the startup resistor, and the low operating current maximizes efficiency while running, \nincreasing the total circuit efficiency, whether operating off-line, DC input, or battery operated circuits. These \nfeatures combine to provide a device capable of reliable, high-frequency operation.\nTable 8-1.

The COMP terminal can \nboth source and sink current. The error amplifier is internally current-limited, so that one can command zero duty \ncycle by externally forcing COMP to GND.\n8.3.1.2 FB\nFB is the inverting input of the error amplifier. The noninverting input to the error amplifier is internally trimmed to \n2.5 V ± 1%. FB is used to control the power converter voltage-feedback loop for stability. For best stability, keep \nFB lead length as short as possible and FB stray capacitance as small as possible.\n8.3.1.3 CS\nThe UCCx8C4x  current sense input connects directly to the PWM comparator. Connect CS to the MOSFET \nsource current sense resistor. The PWM uses this signal to terminate the OUT switch conduction. A voltage \nramp can be applied to this pin to run the device with a voltage mode control configuration or to add slope \ncompensation. To prevent false triggering due to leading edge noises, an RC current sense filter may be \nrequired. The gain of the current sense amplifier is typically 3 V/V.\n8.3.1.4 RT/CT\nThe internal oscillator uses a timing capacitor (C CT) and a timing resistor (R RT) to program the oscillator \nfrequency and maximum duty cycle. The operating frequency can be programmed based the curves in Figure \n7-1, where the timing resistor can be found once the timing capacitor is selected. It is best for the timing \ncapacitor to have a flat temperature coefficient, typical of most COG or NPO type capacitors. For this converter, \n15.4 kΩ and 1000 pF were selected for R RT and C CT to operate at 110-kHz switching.\n8.3.1.5 GND\nGND is the signal and power returning ground. TI recommends separating the signal return path and the high \ncurrent gate driver path so that the signal is not affected by the switching current.\n8.3.1.6 OUT\nThe high-current output stage of the UCCx8C4x has been redesigned to drive the external power switch in \napproximately half the time of the earlier devices. To drive a power MOSFET directly, the totem-pole OUT driver \nsinks or source up to 1 A peak of current. The OUT of the UCCx8C40, UCCx8C42, and UCCx8C43 devices \nswitch at the same frequency as the oscillator and can operate near 100% duty cycle. In the UCCx8C41, \nUCCx8C44, and UCCx8C45, the switching frequency of OUT is one-half that of the oscillator due to an internal T \nflip-flop. This limits the maximum duty cycle in the UCCx8C41, UCCx8C44, and UCCx8C45 to < 50%.\nThe UCCx8C4x family houses unique totem pole drivers exhibiting a 10- Ω impedance to the upper rail and a \n5.5‑Ω impedance to ground, typically. This reduced impedance on the low-side switch helps minimize turnoff \nlosses at the power MOSFET, whereas the higher turnon impedance of the high-side switch is intended to better \nmatch the reverse recovery characteristics of many high-speed output rectifiers. Transition times, rising and \nfalling edges, are typically 25 nanoseconds and 20 nanoseconds, respectively, for a 10% to 90% change in \nvoltage.\nA low impedance MOS structure in parallel with a bipolar transistor, or BiCMOS construction, comprises the \ntotem-pole output structure. This more efficient utilization of silicon delivers the high peak current required along \nwith sharp transitions and full rail-to-rail voltage swings. Furthermore, the output stage is self-biasing, active low \nduring undervoltage lockout type. With no VDD supply voltage present, the output actively pulls low if an attempt \nis made to pull the output high. This condition frequently occurs at initial power-up with a power MOSFET as the \ndriver load.UCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\n8.3.1.7 VDD\nVDD is the power input connection for this device. In normal operation, power VDD through a current limiting \nresistor. The absolute maximum supply voltage is 20 V, including any transients that may be present. If this \nvoltage is exceeded, device damage is likely. This is in contrast to the predecessor bipolar devices, which could \nsurvive up to 30 V on the input bias pin. Also, because no internal clamp is included in the device, the VDD \npin must be protected from external sources which could exceed the 20 V level. If containing the start-up and \nbootstrap supply voltage from the auxiliary winding NA below 20 V under all line and load conditions can not be \nachieved, use a zener protection diode from VDD to GND. Depending on the impedance and arrangement of the \nbootstrap supply, this may require adding a resistor, R VDD, in series with the auxiliary winding to limit the current \ninto the zener as shown in Figure 8-1 . Ensure that over all tolerances and temperatures, the minimum zener \nvoltage is higher than the highest UVLO upper turnon threshold. To prevent noise related problems, filter VDD \nwith a ceramic bypass capacitor to GND. The VDD pin must be decoupled as close to the GND pin as possible.\nRSTART\nCVCCVDD\nOUT\nGNDCVDDbp\n0.1 PFDBIAS\nRCSNP\nNANS\nRVDDTo \nInput\nDZCLAMP\nFigure 8-1. VDD Protection\nAlthough nominal VDD operating current is only 2.3 mA, the total supply current is higher, depending on the \nOUT current. Total VDD current is the sum of quiescent VDD current and the average OUT current. Knowing the \noperating frequency and the MOSFET gate charge (Q g), average OUT current can be calculated from Equation \n1.\nIOUT=Qg×fSW \n(1)\n8.3.1.8 VREF\nVREF is the voltage reference for the error amplifier and also for many other internal circuits in the IC. The \n5-V reference tolerance is ±1% for the UCCx8C4x  family. The high-speed switching logic uses VREF as the \nlogic power supply. The reference voltage is divided down internally to 2.5 V ±1% and connected to the error \namplifier\'s noninverting input for accurate output voltage regulation. The reference voltage sets the internal \nbias currents and thresholds for functions such as the oscillator upper and lower thresholds along with the \novercurrent limiting threshold. The output short-circuit current is 55 mA (maximum). To avoid device over-heating \nand damage, do not pull VREF to ground as a means to terminate switching. For reference stability and to \nprevent noise problems with high-speed switching transients, bypass VREF to GND with a ceramic capacitor \nclose to the IC package. A ceramic capacitor with a minimum value of 0.1 µF is required. Additional VREF \nbypassing is required for external loads on the reference. An electrolytic capacitor may also be used in addition \nto the ceramic capacitor.\nwww.ti.comUCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\n8.3.2 Undervoltage Lockout\nSix sets of UVLO thresholds are available with turn-on and turnoff thresholds of: (14.5 V and 9 V), (8.4 V and \n7.6 V), (7 V and 6.6 V) respectively. The first set is primarily intended for off-line and 48-V distributed power \napplications, where the wider hysteresis allows for lower frequency operation and longer soft-starting time of the \nconverter. The second group of UVLO options is ideal for high frequency DC-DC converters typically running \nfrom a 12-VDC input. The third, and newest, set has been added to address battery powered and portable \napplications. Table 8-2  shows the maximum duty cycle and UVLO thresholds by device.\nTable 8-2.

After crossing the turnon threshold, the device \nsupply current increases to a maximum of 3 mA, typically 2.3 mA. This low start-up current allows the power \nsupply designer to optimize the selection of the startup resistor value to provide a more efficient design. In \napplications where low component cost overrides maximum efficiency, the low run current of 2.3 mA (typical) \nallows the control device to run directly through the single resistor to (+) rail, rather than requiring a bootstrap \nwinding on the power transformer, along with a rectifier. The start and run resistor for this case must also pass \nenough current to allow driving the primary switching MOSFET, which may be a few milliamps in small devices.\n< 100 µA\nVOFF< 3 mA\nVON\nVVDDIVDD\nFigure 8-2. UVLO ON and OFF Profile\n8.3.3 ±1% Internal Reference Voltage\nThe BiCMOS internal reference of 2.5 V has an enhanced design, and uses production trim to allow initial \naccuracy of ±1% at room temperature and ±2% over the full temperature range. This reference voltage can be \nused to eliminate an external reference in applications that do not require the extreme accuracy afforded by the \nadditional device. This reference voltage is useful for non-isolated DC-DC applications, where the control device \nis referenced to the same common as the output. It is also applicable in off-line designs that regulate on the \nprimary side of the isolation boundary by looking at a primary bias winding, or from a winding on the output \ninductor of a buck-derived circuit.UCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\n8.3.4 Current Sense and Overcurrent Limit\nAn external series resistor (R CS) senses the current and converts this current into a voltage that becomes the \ninput to the CS pin. The CS pin is the noninverting input to the PWM comparator. The device compares the CS \ninput with a signal proportional to the error amplifier output voltage. The gain of the current sense amplifier is \ntypically 3 V/V. The peak I SENSE  current is determined using Equation 2\nISENSE=VCS\nRCS \n(2)\nThe typical value for V CS is 1 V. A small RC filter (R CSF and C CSF) may be required to suppress switch transients \ncaused by the reverse recovery of a secondary side diode or equivalent capacitive loading in addition to parasitic \ncircuit impedances. The time constant of this filter should be considerably less than the switching period of the \nconverter.\nCS\nGNDCOMP2 R\nR\nCCSFRCSF\nRCSPWM \nComparator1 VError\nAmplifier\nISENSE\nFigure 8-3. Current-Sense Circuit Schematic\nCycle-by-cycle pulse width modulation performed at the PWM comparator essentially compares the error \namplifier output to the current sense input. This is not a direct volt-to-volt comparison, as the error amplifier \noutput network incorporates two diodes in series with a resistive divider network before connecting to the PWM \ncomparator. The two-diode drop adds an offset voltage that enables zero duty cycle to be achieved with a low \namplifier output. The 2R/R resistive divider facilitates the use of a wider error amplifier output swing that can be \nmore symmetrically centered on the 2.5-V noninverting input voltage.\nThe 1-V Zener diode associated with the PWM comparator input from the error amplifier is not an actual diode \nin the device design, but an indication that the maximum current sense input amplitude is 1 V (typical). When \nthis threshold is reached, regardless of the error amplifier output voltage, cycle-by-cycle current limiting occurs, \nand the output pulse width is terminated within 35 ns (typical).

In addition to the tolerance of this parameter, the accuracy of the current sense \nresistor, or current sense circuitry, must be taken into account.

In its basic operation, a timing capacitor (C CT) is charged \nby a current source, formed by the timing resistor (R RT) connected to the device reference voltage (VREF). \nThe oscillator design incorporates comparators to monitor the amplitude of the timing capacitor voltage. The \nexponentially shaped waveform charges up to a specific amplitude representing the oscillator upper threshold of \n3 V. After the controller reaches this level, an internal current sink to ground turns on and the capacitor begins \nto discharge. This discharge continues until the oscillator lower threshold has reached 0.7 V at which point the \ncurrent sink is turned off. Next, the timing capacitor starts charging again and a new switching cycle begins.\nRRT\nCCTVREF\nRT/CT\nGND\n8.4 mAVDD ON\nVDD OFF \nCCT\ntONtOFF\ntPERIOD\nFigure 8-4. Oscillator Circuit\nWhile the device discharges the timing capacitor, resistor R RT continues attempting to charge C CT. It is the exact \nratio of these two currents, the discharging versus the charging current, which specifies the maximum duty cycle. \nDuring the discharge time of C CT, the device output is always off. This represents an ensured minimum off \ntime of the switch, commonly referred to as dead-time. To program an accurate maximum duty cycle, use the \ninformation provided in Maximum Duty Cycle vs Oscillator Frequency for maximum duty cycle versus oscillator \nfrequency. Any number of maximum duty cycles can be programmed for a given frequency by adjusting the \nvalues of R RT and C CT. After selecting the value of R RT, find the oscillator timing capacitance using the curves in \nOscillator Frequency vs Timing Resistance and Capacitance. However, because resistors are available in more \nprecise increments, typically 1%, and capacitors are only available in 5% accuracy, it might be more practical to \nselect the closest capacitor value first and then calculate the timing resistor value.\n8.3.6 Oscillator Synchronization\nSynchronization is best achieved by forcing the timing capacitor voltage above the oscillator internal upper \nthreshold. A small resistor is placed in series with C CT to GND. This resistor serves as the input for the sync \npulse which raises the C CT voltage above the oscillator internal upper threshold. The PWM is allowed to run \nat the frequency set by R RT and C CT until the sync pulse appears. This scheme offers several advantages \nincluding having the local ramp available for slope compensation. The UCCx8C4x  oscillator must be set to a \nlower frequency than the sync pulse stream, typically 20 percent with a 0.5-V pulse applied across the resistor.\nRRT\nCCTVREF\nRT/CT\nGND\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedCCT50 \r\x03SYNC SYNCCCT + SYNC\nFigure 8-5.

Following start-up of the PWM, the error \namplifier inverting input is low, commanding the error amplifier’s output to go high. The output stage of the \namplifier can source 1 mA typically, which is enough to drive most high impedance compensation networks, but \nnot enough for driving large loads quickly. Soft-start timing is achieved by charging a fairly large value, >1-µF, \ncapacitor (C SS) connected to the error amplifier output through a PNP transistor as shown in Figure 8-6\nVREF\nCOMP\nCSSRSS\n2N2907\nFBZF\nZI\nTo VOUT+\nFigure 8-6. Soft-Start Implementation\nThe limited charging current of the amplifier into the capacitor translates into a dv/dt limitation on the error \namplifier output. This directly corresponds to some maximum rate of change of primary current in a current mode \ncontrolled system as one of the PWM comparator inputs gradually rises. The values of R SS and C SS must be \nselected to bring the COMP pin up at a controlled rate, limiting the peak current supplied by the power stage. \nAfter the soft-start interval is complete, the capacitor continues to charge to VREF, effectively removing the PNP \ntransistor from the circuit consideration. Soft-start timing offers a different, frequently preferred function in current \nmode controlled systems than it does in voltage mode control. In current mode, soft start controls the rising of \nthe peak switch current. In voltage mode control, soft start gradually widens the duty cycle, regardless of the \nprimary current or rate of ramp-up.\nThe purpose of resistor R SS and the diode is to remove the soft-start capacitor from the error amplifier path \nduring normal operation, after the soft-start period completes and the capacitor charges fully. The optional \ndiode in parallel with the resistor forces a soft-start period each time the PWM goes through UVLO condition \nthat forces VREF to go low. Without the diode, the capacitor remains charged during a brief loss of supply or \nbrown-out, and the device does not emable a soft-start function upon re-application of VDD.\n8.3.8 Enable and Disable\nThere are several ways to enable or disable the UCCx8C4x  devices, depending on which type of restart is \nrequired. The two basic techniques use external transistors to either pull the error amplifier output low (< 2 V BE) \nor pull the current sense input high (> 1.1 V). Application of the disable signal causes the output of the PWM \ncomparator to be high. The PWM latch is reset dominant so that the output remains low until the next clock \ncycle after the shutdown condition at the COMP or CS pin is removed. Another choice for restart without a \nsoft-start period is to pull the current sense input above the cycle-by-cycle current limiting threshold. A logic level \nP-channel FET from the reference voltage to the current sense input can be used.\nCOMP\nDISABLE\nFigure 8-7.

Although not required, slope compensation also improves stability in applications using below \na 50% maximum duty cycle. Slope compensation is introduced by injecting a portion of the oscillator waveform \nto the actual sensed primary current. The two signals are summed together at the current sense input (CS) \nconnection at the filter capacitor. To minimize loading on the oscillator, it is best to buffer the timing capacitor \nwaveform with a small transistor whose collector is connected to the reference voltage.\nCCTVREF\nRT/CT\nCS0.1 µF RRT\nRRAMP\nCCSFRCSF\nRCSISENSE\nFigure 8-8. Slope Compensation Circuit\n8.3.10 Voltage Mode\nIn certain applications, voltage mode control may be a preferred control strategy for a variety of reasons. Voltage \nmode control is easily executable with any current mode controller, especially the UCCx8C4x  family members. \nImplementation requires generating a 0-V to 0.9-V sawtooth shaped signal to input to the current sense pin \n(CS) which is also one input to the PWM comparator. This is compared to the divided down error amplifier \noutput voltage at the other input of the PWM comparator. As the error amplifier output is varied, it intersects the \nsawtooth waveform at different points in time, thereby generating different pulse widths. This is a straightforward \nmethod of linearly generating a pulse whose width is proportional to the error voltage.\nImplementation of voltage mode control is possible by using a fraction of the oscillator timing capacitor \n(CCT) waveform. This value can be divided down and fed to the current sense pin as shown in Figure 8-9 . \nThe oscillator timing components must be selected to approximate as close to a linear sawtooth waveform \nas possible. Although exponentially charged, large values of timing resistance and small values of timing \ncapacitance help approximate a more linear shaped waveform. A small transistor is used to buffer the oscillator \ntiming components from the loading of the resistive divider network. Due to the offset of the oscillator’s lower \ntiming threshold, a DC blocking capacitor is added.\nVREF\nRT/CTRRT\nCCTCS2N2222\nFigure 8-9.

When used in voltage mode control, the controller regulates the power converter\'s duty cycle. The \nregulation of the system\'s peak current and duty cycle can be achieved with the use of the integrated error \namplifier and external feedback circuitry.\n8.4.2 UVLO Mode\nDuring the system start-up, VDD voltage starts to rise from 0 V. Before the VDD voltage reaches its \ncorresponding turn-on threshold, the IC is operating in UVLO mode. During UVLO mode operation, the VREF \npin voltage is not generated. When VDD is above 1 V and below the turn-on threshold, the VREF pin is actively \npulled low. This behavior allows VREF to be used as a logic signal to indicate UVLO mode. If the bias voltage to \nVDD drops below the UVLO-OFF threshold, the PWM switching stops and VREF returns to 0 V. The device can \nbe restarted by applying a voltage greater than the UVLO-ON threshold to the VDD pin.\nwww.ti.comUCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

The \ncontroller uses an inner current control loop that contains a small current sense resistor which senses the \nprimary inductor current ramp. This current sense resistor transforms the inductor current waveform to a voltage \nsignal that is input directly into the primary side PWM comparator. This inner loop determines the response to \ninput voltage changes. An outer voltage control loop involves comparing a portion of the output voltage to a \nreference voltage at the input of an error amplifier. When used in an off-line isolated application, the voltage \nfeedback of the isolated output is accomplished using a secondary-side error amplifier and adjustable voltage \nreference, such as the TL431. The error signal crosses the primary to secondary isolation boundary using an \nopto-isolator whose collector is connected to the VREF pin and the emitter is connected to FB. The outer voltage \ncontrol loop determines the response to load changes.\nVIN= 85 VAC \nto 265 VAC\nDBRIDGE~\n~+ ±\nCIN\n180 µFRSNUB\n50 k\r\x03CSNUB\n10 nF\nNP NS\nNADCLAMP\nLP=1. 5 mH\nNP:NS= 10\nNP:NA= 10COUT\n2200 µFVOUT\n12 V,\n4 ADOUT\nRVDD\n22 \r\x03 DBIAS\n1\n2\n3\n4COMP\nFB\nCS\nRT/CT 5678\nGNDOUTVDD VREFUCC28C42\nRBLEEDER\n10 k\r\x03CVREF\n1 µFCVDD\n120 µFRSTART\n420 k\r\x03\nRG\n10 \r\x03\nRCS\n0. 75 \r\x03CSS\nRSS\nCCSF\n100 pFRCSF\n3. 8 k\r\x03\nRP\nNot PopulatedQSW\nTL431RFBU\n9. 53 k\r\x03\nRFBB\n2. 49 k\r\x03CCOMPz\n0. 01 µFRCOMPz\n88. 7 k\r\x0310 VCCOMPp\n10 nF\nRFBG\n4. 99 k\r\x03RLED\n1.3 k\r\x03\nROPTO\n1 k\r\x03OPTO-\nCOUPLERRTLbiasCVDDbp\nCRAMP\n10 nF\nRRAMPRRT\n15.4 k\r\x03\nCCT\n1000 pFRCOMPp\n10 k\r\x03\nDZ\n18 V\n1 k\r\x03\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated24.9 k\r\x030.1 µF\nFigure 9-3.

See Figure 9-3  for component names referred to in the design procedure.\n9.2.2.1 Input Bulk Capacitor and Minimum Bulk Voltage\nBulk capacitance may consist of one or more capacitors connected in parallel, often with some inductance \nbetween them to suppress differential-mode conducted noise. The value of the input capacitor sets the minimum \nbulk voltage;. Setting the bulk voltage lower by using minimal input capacitance results in higher peak primary \ncurrents leading to more stress on the MOSFET switch, the transformer, and the output capacitors. Setting \nthe bulk voltage higher by using a larger input capacitor results in higher peak current from the input source \nand the capacitor itself is physically larger. Compromising between size and component stresses determines \nthe acceptable minimum input voltage. The total required value for the primary-side bulk capacitance (C IN) is \nselected based upon the power level of the converter (P OUT), the efficiency target ( η), the minimum input voltage \n(VIN(min) ), and is chosen to maintain an acceptable minimum bulk voltage level (V BULK(min) ), using Equation 3 .\nCIN=2×PIN×F0.25+1\nN×arcsinFVBULK(min)\n¾2×VIN(min)GG\nk2×VIN(min)2FVBULK(min)2o×fLINE(min) \n(3)\nwhere\n•VIN(min)  is the RMS value of the minimum AC input voltage (85 VRMS) whose minimum line frequency is \ndenoted as f LINE(min) , equal to 47 Hz\nBased on Equation 3 , to achieve a minimum bulk voltage of 75 V, assuming 85% converter efficiency, the bulk \ncapacitor must be larger than 126 µF. this design uses a value of 180 µF, with consideration for component \ntolerances and efficiency estimation.\n9.2.2.2 Transformer Turns Ratio and Maximum Duty Cycle\nThe transformer design begins with selecting a suitable switching frequency for the given application. The \nUCC28C42 is capable of switching up to 1 MHz but considerations such as overall converter size, switching \nlosses, core loss, system compatibility, and interference with communication frequency bands generally \ndetermine an optimum frequency that should be used. For this off-line converter, the switching frequency (f SW) is \nselected to be 110 kHz as a compromise to minimize the transformer size and the EMI filter size, and still have \nacceptable losses.\nThe transformer primary to secondary turns ratio (N PS) can be selected based on the desired MOSFET voltage \nrating and the secondary diode voltage rating. Because the maximum input voltage is 265 VRMS, the peak bulk \ninput voltage can be calculated as shown in Equation 4 .\nVBULK (max ) =¾2× V IN (max )N375 V  \n(4)\nTo minimize the cost of the system, a readily available 650-V MOSFET is selected. Derating the maximum \nvoltage stress on the drain to 80% of its rated value and allowing for a leakage inductance voltage spike of up \nto 30% of the maximum bulk input voltage, the reflected output voltage must be less than 130 V as shown in \nEquation 5 .\n\x0b \x0c REFLECTED DS(rated) BULK(max)V 0.8 V 1.3 V 130.2V  u \x10 u  \n(5)\nThe maximum primary to secondary transformer turns ratio (N PS) for a 12 V output can be selected as\nNPS=VREFLECTED\nVOUT=10.85  \n(6)\nwww.ti.comUCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\nA turns ratio of N PS = 10 is used in the design example.\nThe auxiliary winding is used to supply bias voltage to the controller. Maintaining the bias voltage above the VDD \nminimum operating voltage after turnon is required for stable operation. The minimum VDD operating voltage for \nthe controller selected for this design is 10 V. The auxiliary winding is selected to support a 12 V bias voltage so \nthat it is above the minimum operating level but maintains a low level of losses in the IC. The primary to auxiliary \nturns ratio (N PA) can be calculated from Equation 7 :\nNPA=NPS×VOUT\nVBIAS=10  \n(7)\nThe output diode experiences a voltage stress that is equal to the output voltage plus the reflected input voltage:\nVDIODE =VBULK:max;\nNPS+ V OUT = 49.5 V  \n(8)\nTI recommends a Schottky diode with a rated blocking voltage greater than 60 V to allow for voltage spikes due \nto ringing.

An \ninductance value that allows the converter to stay in CCM over a wider operating range before transitioning into \ndiscontinuous current mode is used to minimize losses due to otherwise high currents and also to decrease the \noutput ripple. The design of the transformer in this example sizes the inductance so the converter enters CCM \noperation at approximately 10% load and minimum bulk voltage to minimize output ripple.\nThe inductor (L P) for a CCM flyback can be calculated using Equation 11 .\nLP=1\n2×kVBULK:min;o2×lNPS×VOUT\nVBULK:min;+NPS×VOUTp2\n0.1×PIN×fSW \n(11)\nwhere\n•PIN is estimated by dividing the maximum output power (P OUT) by the target efficiency (η)\n•fSW is the switching frequency of the converter\nFor the UCC28C42 the switching frequency is equal to the oscillator frequency and is set to 110 kHz. Selecting \nfSW to be 110 kHz provides a good compromise between size of magnetics, switching losses, and places \nthe first harmonic below the 150-kHz lower limit of EN55022. Therefore, the transformer inductance must be \napproximately 1.8 mH. A 1.5 mH inductance is chosen as the magnetizing inductance, L P, value for this design.UCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\nBased on calculated inductor value and the switching frequency, the current stress of the MOSFET and output \ndiode can be calculated.\nThe peak current in the primary-side MOSFET of a CCM flyback can be calculated as shown in Equation 12 .\nIPK MOSFET=PIN\nVBULK:min;×NPS× V OUT\nVBULK:min;+:NPS× V OUT;+nVBULK (min )\n2 × L m×NPS× V OUT\nVBULK:min;+:NPS× V OUT;\nfSWr  \n(12)\nThe MOSFET peak current is 1.36 A.

Typically, the direct current sense signal contains a large amplitude leading \nedge spike associated with the turnon of the main power MOSFET, reverse recovery of the output rectifier, and \nother factors including charging and discharging of parasitic capacitances. Therefore, C CSF and R CSF form a \nlow-pass filter that provides immunity to suppress the leading edge spike. For this converter, C CSF is chosen to \nbe 100 pF.\nWithout R P, RCS sets the maximum peak current in the transformer primary based on the maximum amplitude of \nthe CS pin, which is specified to be 1 V. To achieve 1.36-A primary side peak current, a 0.75- Ω resistor is chosen \nfor R CS.\nThe high current sense threshold of CS helps to provide better noise immunity to the system but also results \nin higher losses in the current sense resistor. These current sense losses can be minimized by injecting an \noffset voltage into the current sense signal using R P. RP and R CSF form a resistor divider network from the \ncurrent sense signal to the reference voltage of the controller (V VREF) which adds an offset to the current \nsense voltage. This technique still achieves current mode control with cycle-by-cycle over-current protection. To \ncalculate required offset value (V OFFSET ), use Equation 16 .\nVOFFSET=RCSF\nRCSF+RP×VREF \n(16)\nAfter adding the R P resistance, adjust the R CS value accordingly.\n9.2.2.6 Gate Drive Resistor\nRG is the gate driver resistor for the power switch (Q SW). The selection of this resistor value must be done in \nconjunction with EMI compliance testing and efficiency testing. Using a larger resistor value for R G slows down \nthe turnon and turnoff of the MOSFET. A slower switching speed reduces EMI but also increases the switching \nloss. A tradeoff between switching loss and EMI performance must be carefully performed. For this design, a \n10‑Ω resistor was chosen for the gate drive resistor.\n9.2.2.7 VREF Capacitor\nA precision 5-V reference voltage performs several important functions. The reference voltage is divided down \ninternally to 2.5 V and connected to the error amplifier’s noninverting input for accurate output voltage regulation. \nOther duties of the reference voltage are to set internal bias currents and thresholds for functions such as \nthe oscillator upper and lower thresholds. Therefore, the reference voltage must be bypassed with a ceramic \ncapacitor. A 1-µF, 16-V ceramic capacitor was selected for this converter. Placement of this capacitor on the \nphysical printed-circuit board layout must be as close as possible to the respective VREF and GND pins.\n9.2.2.8 RT/CT\nThe internal oscillator uses a timing capacitor (C CT) and a timing resistor (R RT) to program the oscillator \nfrequency and maximum duty cycle. The operating frequency can be programmed based the curves in Figure \n7-1, where the timing resistor can be found once the timing capacitor is selected. It is best for the timing \ncapacitor to have a flat temperature coefficient, typical of most COG or NPO type capacitors. For this converter, \n15.4 kΩ and 1000 pF were selected for R RT and C CT to operate at 110-kHz switching.UCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\n9.2.2.9 Start-Up Circuit\nAt start-up, the IC gets its power directly from the high-voltage bulk, through a high-voltage resistor (R START ). \nThe selection of the start-up resistor is the tradeoff between power loss and start-up time. The current flowing \nthrough R START  at the minimum input voltage must be higher than the VDD current under UVLO conditions (100 \nµA at its maximum value). A resistance of 420-k Ω was chosen for R START , providing 250 µA of start-up current \nat low-line conditions. The start-up resistor is physically comprised of two 210-k Ω resistors in series to meet the \nhigh voltage requirements and power rating at high-line.\nAfter VDD is charged up above the UVLO-ON threshold, the UCC28C42 starts to consume full operating \ncurrent. The VDD capacitor is required to provide enough energy to prevent its voltage from dropping below \nthe UVLO-OFF threshold during start-up, before the output is able to reach its regulated level. A large bulk \ncapacitance would hold more energy but would result in slower start-up time. In this design, a 120-µF capacitor \nis chosen to provide enough energy and maintain a start-up time of approximately 7 seconds. For faster start-up, \nthe bulk capacitor value may be decreased or the R START  resistor modified to a lower value.\n9.2.2.10 Voltage Feedback Compensation\nFeedback compensation, also called closed-loop control, can reduce or eliminate steady state error, reduce \nthe sensitivity of the system to parametric changes, change the gain or phase of a system over some desired \nfrequency range, reduce the effects of small signal load disturbances and noise on system performance, and \ncreate a stable system from an unstable system. A system is stable if its response to a perturbation is that the \nperturbation eventually dies out. A peak current mode flyback uses an outer voltage feedback loop to stabilize \nthe converter. To adequately compensate the voltage loop, the open-loop parameters of the power stage must \nbe determined.\n9.2.2.10.1 Power Stage Poles and Zeroes\nThe first step in compensating a fixed frequency flyback is to verify if the converter is continuous conduction \nmode (CCM) or discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). If the primary inductance (L P) is greater than the \ninductance for DCM or CCM boundary mode operation, called the critical inductance (L Pcrit), then the converter \noperates in CCM:\nLP> L Pcrit , then CCM  \n(17)\nLPcrit=ROUT×:NPS;2\n2×fSW×lVIN\nVIN+VOUT×NPSp2\n \n(18)\nFor the entire input voltage range, the selected inductor has a value larger than the critical inductor. Therefore, \nthe converter operates in CCM and the compensation loop requires design based on CCM flyback equations.\nThe current-to-voltage conversion is done externally with the ground-referenced R CS and the internal 2R/R \nresistor divider which sets up the internal current sense gain, A CS = 3. The exact value of these internal resistors \nis not critical but the IC provides tight control of the resistor divider ratio, so regardless of the actual resistor \nvalue variations their relative value to each other is maintained.\nThe DC open-loop gain (G O) of the fixed-frequency voltage control loop of a peak current mode control CCM \nflyback converter shown in Equation 19  is approximated by first using the output load (R OUT), the primary to \nsecondary turns ratio (N PS), and the maximum duty cycle (D) as calculated in Equation 20 .\nGO=ROUT × N PS\nRCS× A CS   ×1\n:1FD;2\nRL+:2 × M;+ 1 \n(19)\nIn Equation 19 , D is calculated with Equation 20 , τL is calculated with Equation 21 , and M is calculated with \nEquation 22 .\nwww.ti.comUCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\nD=NPS×VOUT\nVBULKmin+:NPS×VOUT; (20)\nRL =2 × L P× f SW\nROUT ×:NPS;2 \n(21)\nM=VOUT×NPS\nVBULKmin \n(22)\nFor this design, a converter with an output voltage (V OUT) of 12 V, and 48 W relates to an output load (R OUT) \nequal to 3 Ω at full load. With a maximum duty cycle of 0.627, a current sense resistance of 0.75 Ω, and a \nprimary to secondary turns-ratio of 10, the open-loop gain calculates to 3.082 or 9.776 dB.\nA CCM flyback has two zeroes that are of interest. The ESR and the output capacitance contribute a left-half \nplane zero ( ωESRz) to the power stage, and the frequency of this zero (f ESRz), are calculated with Equation 23 \nand Equation 24 .\nXESRz=1\nRESR×COUT \n(23)\nfESRz=1\n2×N×RESR×COUT \n(24)\nThe f ESRz zero for an output capacitance of 2200 µF and a total ESR of 43 mΩ is located at 1.682 kHz.\nCCM flyback converters have a zero in the right-half plane (RHP) in their transfer function. A RHP zero has the \nsame 20 dB per decade rising gain magnitude with increasing frequency just like a left-half plane zero, but it \nadds a 90° phase lag instead of lead. This phase lag tends to limit the overall loop bandwidth. The frequency \nlocation (f RHPz) of the RHP zero ( ωRHPz) is a function of the output load, the duty cycle, the primary inductance \n(LP), and the primary to secondary side turns ratio (N PS).\nXRHPz =ROUT ×:1FD;2 ×:NPS;2\nLP× D \n(25)\nfRHPz =ROUT ×:1FD;2 ×:NPS;2\n2 ×N× L P× D \n(26)\nThe right-half plane zero frequency increases with higher input voltage and lighter load. Generally, the design \nrequires consideration of the worst case of the lowest right-half plane zero frequency and the converter must be \ncompensated at the minimum input and maximum load condition. With a primary inductance of 1.5 mH, at 75-V \nDC input, the RHP zero frequency (f RHPz) is equal to 7.07 kHz at maximum duty cycle, full load.\nThe power stage has one dominate pole ( ωP1) which is in the region of interest, located at a lower frequency \n(fP1); which is related to the duty cycle, the output load, and the output capacitance, and calculated with Equation \n28. There is also a double pole placed at half the switching frequency of the converter (f P2) calculated with \nEquation 30 . For this example, pole f P1 is located at 40.37 Hz and f P2 is at 55 kHz.\nXP1=:1FD;3\nRL+1+D\nROUT×COUT \n(27)UCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\nfP1=:1FD;3\nRL+1+D\n2×N×ROUT×COUT (28)\nXP2=N×fSW \n(29)\nfP2=fSW\n2 \n(30)\n9.2.2.10.2 Slope Compensation\nSlope compensation is the large signal subharmonic instability that can occur with duty cycles that may extend \nbeyond 50% where the rising primary side inductor current slope may not match the falling secondary side \ncurrent slope. The subharmonic oscillation would result in an increase in the output voltage ripple and may even \nlimit the power handling capability of the converter.\nThe target of slope compensation is to achieve an ideal quality coefficient (Q P), equal to 1 at half of the switching \nfrequency.

There are three \ndistinct portions of the loop: the TL431, the opto-coupler, and the error amplifier. Each of these stages combines \nwith the power stage to result in a stable robust system.\nFor good transient response, the bandwidth of the finalized design must be as large as possible. The bandwidth \nof a CCM flyback, f BW, is limited to ¼ of the RHP zero frequency, or approximately 1.77 kHz using Equation 41 .\nfBW=fRHPz\n4 \n(41)\nThe gain of the open-loop power stage at f BW can be calculated using Equation 40  or can be observed on the \nBode plot ( Figure 9-4 ) and is equal to –19.55 dB and the phase at f BW is equal to –58°.\nThe secondary side portion of the compensation loop begins with establishing the regulated steady state output \nvoltage. To set the regulated output voltage, a TL431 adjustable precision shunt regulator is ideally suited for \nuse on the secondary side of isolated converters due to its accurate voltage reference and internal op-amp. \nThe resistors used in the divider from the output terminals of the converter to the TL431 REF pin are selected \nbased upon the desired power consumption. Because the REF input current for the TL431 is only 2 µA, selecting \nthe resistors for a divider current (I FB_REF ) of 1 mA results in minimal error. The top divider resistor (R FBU) is \ncalculated:\nRFBU=VOUTFREFTL431\nIFB_REF \n(42)\nThe TL431 reference voltage (REF TL431 ) has a typical value of 2.495 V. A 9.53-kΩ resistor is chosen for R FBU. To \nset the output voltage to 12 V, 2.49 kΩ is used for R FBB.\nRFBB=REFTL431\nVOUTFREFTL431×RFBU \n(43)\nFor good phase margin, a compensator zero (f COMPz ) is required and should be placed at 1/10th the desired \nbandwidth:\nfCOMPz=fBW\n10 \n(44)\nXCOMPz=2×N×fCOMPz  \n(45)\nWith this converter, f COMPz  should be set at approximately 177 Hz. A series resistor (R COMPz ) and capacitor \n(CCOMPz ) placed across the TL431 cathode to REF sets the compensator zero location. Setting C COMPz  to \n0.01 µF, R COMPz  is calculated:\nRCOMPz=1\nXCOMPz×CCOMPz \n(46)\nUsing a standard value of 88.7 kΩ for R Z and a 0.01 µF for C Z results in a zero placed at 179 Hz.\nIn Figure 9-3 , RTLbias  provides cathode current to the TL431 from the regulated voltage provided from the Zener \ndiode (D REG). For robust performance, 10 mA is provided to bias the TL431 by way of the 10-V Zener and a \n1-kΩ resistor is used for R TLbias .\nThe gain of the TL431 portion of the compensation loop is calculated with Equation 47 .\nwww.ti.comUCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 33\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\nGTL431:s;=lRCOMPz+1\ns(f)×CZCOMPzp×1\nRFBU (47)\nA compensation pole is required at the frequency of right half plane zero or the ESR zero, whichever is lowest. \nBased previous the analysis, the right half plane zero (f RHPz) is located at 7.07 kHz and the ESR zero (f ESRz) \nis at 1.68 kHz; therefore, for this design, the compensation pole must be put at 1.68 kHz. The opto-coupler \ncontains a parasitic pole that is difficult to characterize over frequency so the opto-coupler is set up with a \npull-down resistor (R OPTO ) equal to 1 kΩ, which moves the parasitic opto-coupler pole further out and beyond the \nrange of interest for this design.\nThe required compensation pole can be added to the primary side error amplifier using R COMPp  and C COMPp . \nChoosing R COMPp  as 10 kΩ, the required value of C COMPp  is determined using Equation 48 .\nCCOMPp =1\n2 ×N× f ESRz × R COMPp= 9.46 nF  \n(48)\nA 10-nF capacitor is used for C COMPp  setting the compensation pole at 1.59 kHz.\nAdding a DC gain to the primary-side error amplifier may be required to obtain the required bandwidth and \nhelps to adjust the loop gain as needed.

Output Voltage Behavior at Full Load Start-up (5 V/div)\n9.3 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe absolute maximum supply voltage is 20 V of UCC28C42 , including any transients that may be present. If \nthis voltage is exceeded, device damage is likely. This damage risk is in contrast to the predecessor bipolar \ndevices, which could survive up to 30 V. Thus, the supply pin must be decoupled as close to the GND pin as \npossible.\nBecause no clamp is included in the device, the supply pin must be protected from external sources which could \nexceed the 20-V  level.\nTo prevent false triggering due to leading edge noises, an RC current sense filter may be required on CS. Keep \nthe time constant of the RC filter well below the minimum on-time pulse width.\nTo prevent noise problems with high-speed switching transients, bypass VREF to ground with a ceramic \ncapacitor close to the IC package. A minimum of 0.1-µF ceramic capacitor is required. Additional VREF \nbypassing is required for external loads on the reference. An electrolytic capacitor may also be used in addition \nto the ceramic capacitor.UCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n36 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\n9.4 Layout\n9.4.1 Layout Guidelines\n9.4.1.1 Precautions\nCareful layout of the printed board is a necessity for high-frequency power supplies. As the device-switching \nspeeds and operating frequencies increase, the layout of the converter becomes increasingly important.\nThis 8-pin device has only a single ground for the logic and power connections. This forces the gate-drive \ncurrent pulses to flow through the same ground that the control circuit uses for reference. Thus, the interconnect \ninductance must be minimized as much as possible. One implication is to place the device (gate driver) circuitry \nclose to the MOSFET it is driving. This can conflict with the need for the error amplifier and the feedback path to \nbe away from the noise generating components.\nThe single most critical item in a PWM controlled printed-circuit board layout is the placement of the timing \ncapacitor. While both the supply and reference bypass capacitor locations are important, the timing capacitor \nplacement is far more critical. Any noise spikes on the C CT waveform due to lengthy printed circuit trace \ninductance or pick-up noise from being in proximity to high power switching noise causes a variety of operational \nproblems. Dilemmas vary from incorrect operating frequency caused by pre-triggering the oscillator due to noise \nspikes to frequency jumping with varying duty cycles, also caused by noise spikes. The placement of the timing \ncapacitor must be treated as the most important layout consideration. Keep PC traces as short as possible to \nminimize added series inductance.\n9.4.1.2 Feedback Traces\nTry to run the feedback trace as far from the inductor and noisy power traces as possible. You would also like \nthe feedback trace to be as direct as possible and somewhat thick. These two sometimes involve a trade-off, but \nkeeping it away from EMI and other noise sources is the more critical of the two. If possible, run the feedback \ntrace on the side of the PCB opposite of the inductor with a ground plane separating the two.\n9.4.1.3 Bypass Capacitors\nWhen using a low value ceramic bypass capacitor, it must be placed as close to the VDD pin of the device \nas possible. This eliminates as much trace inductance effects as possible and give the internal device rail a \ncleaner voltage supply. Using surface mount capacitors also reduces lead length and lessens the chance of \nnoise coupling into the effective antenna created by through-hole components.\nwww.ti.comUCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 37\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\n9.4.1.4 Compensation Components\nFor best stability, external compensation components must be placed close to the IC. Keep FB lead length as \nshort as possible and FB stray capacitance as small as possible. TI recommends surface mount components \nhere as well for the same reasons discussed for the filter capacitors. These must not be placed very close to \ntraces with high switching noise.\n9.4.1.5 Traces and Ground Planes\nMake all of the power (high current) traces as short, direct, and thick as possible. It is good practice on a \nstandard PCB board to make the traces an absolute minimum of 15 mils (0.381 mm) per ampere. The inductor, \noutput capacitors, and output diode must be as close to each other possible. This helps reduce the EMI radiated \nby the power traces due to the high switching currents through them. This also reduces lead inductance and \nresistance as well, which in turn reduces noise spikes, ringing, and resistive losses that produce voltage errors.\nThe grounds of the IC, input capacitors, output capacitors, and output diode, if applicable, must be connected \nclose together directly to a ground plane. It would also be a good idea to have a ground plane on both sides \nof the PCB. This reduces noise as well by reducing ground loop errors as well as by absorbing more of the \nEMI radiated by the inductor. For multi-layer boards with more than two layers, a ground plane can be used \nto separate the power plane, where the power traces and components are, and the signal plane, where the \nfeedback and compensation and components are, for improved performance. On multi-layer boards the use of \nvias is required to connect traces and different planes. It is good practice to use one standard via per 200 mA of \ncurrent if the trace conducts a significant amount of current from one plane to the other.\nArrange the components so that the switching current loops curl in the same direction. Due to the way switching \nregulators operate, there are two power states. One state when the switch is ON and one when the switch is \nOFF. During each state there is a current loop made by the power components that are currently conducting. \nPlace the power components so that during each of the two states the current loop is conducting in the same \ndirection. This prevents magnetic field reversal caused by the traces between the two half-cycles and reduces \nradiated EMI.UCC28C40, UCC28C41, UCC28C42, UCC28C43, UCC28C44, UCC28C45, UCC38C40, UCC38C41, \nUCC38C42, UCC38C43, UCC38C44, UCC38C45\nSLUS458H – JULY 2000 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n38 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC28C40  UCC28C41  UCC28C42  UCC28C43  UCC28C44  UCC28C45  UCC38C40 \nUCC38C41  UCC38C42  UCC38C43  UCC38C44  UCC38C45\n9.4.2 Layout Example\nTO-220FP Bo\x01om View\nVREFOUT\nCOMPCS\nFBRT/CT\nVDDGNDTrack To\n     Transformer  =>Track To\n<=  Bulk Cap \x02MOSFET Heatsink\nAux CapS\nDGWave Solder Direc on ==>CVDDTrack To\n<=  Bulk Cap +TRANSFORMER6\n4\n12AUX Winding ½ PRI Winding ½ PRI Winding\n22AWG \nJumper \nWire\n22AWG Jumper Wires\nPCB Bo\x00om-side ViewK\nA CE\nFigure 9-13.
