NAME PIN #T YPE DESCRIPTION\n XR16L788\n7REV. 1.2.3 HIGH PERFORMANCE 2.97V TO 5.5V OCTAL UART\n1.0 DESCRIPTION \nThe XR16L788 (788) integrates the functions of 8 en hanced 16550 UARTs, a general purpose 16-bit timer/\ncounter and an on-chip oscillato r. The device configuration registers incl ude a set of four co nsecutive interrupt \nsource registers that provides interrupt-status for all 8 UARTs, timer/counter and a sleep wake up indicator. \nEach UART channel has its own 16550 UART compatible configuration register set for individual channel control, status, and data transfer. Additionally, each UART  channel has 64-byte of transmit and receive FIFOs, \nautomatic RTS/CTS or DTR/DSR hardware  flow control with hysteresis contro l, automatic Xon/Xoff and special \ncharacter software flow control, programmable transmit and receive FIFO trigger le vels, FIFO level counters, \ninfrared encoder and decoder (IrDA ver. 1.0), programmabl e baud rate generator with a prescaler of divide by \n1 or 4, and data rate up to 6.25 Mbps with 8X sampling clock or 3.125Mbps with 16X sampling clock. The XR16L788 is a 5V and 3.3V device with 5 volt tolerant inputs (except XTAL1).\n2.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS\n2.1 Device Reset \n2.1.1 Hardware Reset\nThe RST# input resets the internal registers and the serial interface outputs in all 8 channels to their default \nstate (see Table  19).  A LOW pulse of longer than 40 ns duration  will be required to activate the reset function \nin the device.  \n2.1.2 Software Reset\nThe internal registers of each UART can be reset by wr iting to the RESET register in the Device Configuration \nRegisters.  For more details, see the RESET register  description on page  25.  \n2.2 UART Channel Selection\nThe UART provides the user with the capability to bi-directionally tr ansfer information be tween an external \nCPU and an external serial communication device. A logic 0 on the chip select pins, CS#, allows the user to \nselect one of the UART channels to configure, send transmit data and/or unload receive data to/from the \nUART.  When address line A7 = 0, address lines A6:A4 are used to select one of the eight channels.  See \nTable  1 below for UART channel selection.\n \n2.3 Simultaneous Write to All Channels\nDuring a write cycle, the setting of REGB bit-0 to a logic 1 will override th e channel selection of address A6:A4 \nand allow a simultaneous write to all 8 UART channel s when any channel is written to.  This functional \ncapability allow the registers in all 8 UART channels to  be modified concurrently , saving individual channel \ninitialization time.  Caution should be  considered, however, when using this  capability.  Any in-process serial \ndata transfer may be disrupted by changing an active channel’s mode.  Also, REGB bit-0 should be reset to a \nlogic 0 before a ttempting to read from the UART.TABLE  1: UART C HANNEL  SELECTION\nA7 A6 A5 A4 FUNCTION\n0 0 0 0 Channel 0 Selected\n0 0 0 1 Channel 1 Selected\n0 0 1 0 Channel 2 Selected\n0 0 1 1 Channel 3 Selected\n0 1 0 0 Channel 4 Selected\n0 1 0 1 Channel 5 Selected\n0 1 1 0 Channel 6 Selected\n0 1 1 1 Channel 7 Selected\nXR16L788  \n8HIGH PERFORMANCE 2.97V TO 5.5V OCTAL UART REV. 1.2.3\n2.4 INT# Ouput\nThe INT# interrupt output changes according to the operating mode and enhanced features setup. Table  2\nand 3 summarize the operating behavior for the transmitter and receiver.   \n2.5 CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR / BUFFER\nThe 788 includes an on-chip oscillator (XTAL1 and XTAL2) . The crystal oscillator provides the system clock to \nthe Baud Rate Generators (BRG) in each of the 8 UA RTs, the 16-bit general purpose timer/counter and \ninternal logics. XTAL1 is the input to the oscillator or external clock buffer input with XTAL2 pin being the \noutput. For programming details, see “Section 2.6, Programmable Baud Rate Generator” on page  9.\nThe on-chip oscillator is designed to  use an industry standard micropro cessor crystal (p arallel resonant, \nfundamental frequency with 10-22 pF capacitance load, ESR of 20-120 ohms and 100ppm frequency \ntolerance) connected externally between the XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins (see Figure  3). Alternatively, an external \nclock can be connected to the XTAL1 pin to clock the internal 8 baud rate generators for standard or custom rates. Typically, the oscillato r connections are shown in \nFigure  3. For further reading on oscillator circuit please \nsee application note DA N108 on EXAR’s web site.TABLE  2: INT# P IN OPERATION  FOR TRANSMITTER\nAuto RS485 \nModeFCR B IT-0 = 0 \n(FIFO D ISABLED )FCR B IT-0 = 1 \n(FIFO E NABLED )\nINT# Pin NO HIGH = a byte in THR\nLOW = THR emptyHIGH = FIFO above trigger level\nLOW = FIFO below trigger level or FIFO empty\nINT# Pin YES HIGH = a byte in THR\nLOW = transmitter emptyHIGH = FIFO above trigger level\nLOW = FIFO below trigger level or transmitter empty \nTABLE  3: INT# P IN OPERATION  FOR RECEIVER\nFCR B IT-0 = 0 \n(FIFO D ISABLED )FCR B IT-0 = 1\n(FIFO E NABLED )\nINT# Pin HIGH = no data\nLOW = 1 byteHIGH = FIFO below trigger level\nLOW = FIFO above trigger level\nFIGURE  3.

The programmable Baud Rate Generator is capable of operating with a crystal frequency of \nup to 24 MHz. However, with an external clock input on XTAL1 pin and a 2K ohms pull-up resistor on XTAL2 \npin (as shown in Figure  4) it can extend its operation up to 50 MHz (3.125 Mbps serial data rate) at room \ntemperature and 5.0V. \nFIGURE  4.  E XTERNAL  CLOCK  CONNECTION  FOR EXTENDED  DATA RATE\nEach UART has its own Baud Rate Generator (BRG) with a prescaler for the transmitter and receiver. The prescaler is controlled by a software bit in the MCR register. The MCR register bit-7 sets the prescaler to divide the input crystal or external clock by 1 or 4. The outpu t of the prescaler clocks to the BRG. The BRG further \ndivides this clock by a programmable divisor between 1 and (2\n16 -1) to obtain a 16X or 8X sampling clock of \nthe serial data rate. The sampling clock is used by the transmitter for data bit shifting and  receiver for data \nsampling. The BRG divisor (DLL and DLM registers) defaul ts to a random value upon power up. Therefore, the \nBRG must be programmed during initializ ation to the operating data rate. \n \nFIGURE  5.

Table  4 shows the standard data rates availabl e with a 14.7456 MHz crystal or external \nclock at 16X clock rate. At 8X sampling rate, these data rates would double. When using a non-standard data \nrate crystal or external clock, th e divisor value can be calculated for channel ‘N’ with the fo llowing equation(s).\n2.7 Transmitter\nThe transmitter section comprises of an 8-bit Transmit Shift Register (TSR) and 64 bytes of FIFO which \nincludes a byte-wide Transmit Holding Register (THR). TSR shifts out every data bit with the 16X internal \nclock. A bit time is 16 clock periods (see EMSR bit- 7). The transmitter sends the start-bit followed by the \nnumber of data bits, inserts the proper parity-bit if enabl ed, and adds the stop-bit(s). The status of the FIFO and \nTSR are reported in the Line Status Register (LSR bit-5 and bit-6).\n2.7.1 Transmit Holding Regi ster (THR) - Write Only\nThe transmit holding register is an 8-bit register pr oviding a data interface to the host processor. The host \nwrites transmit data byte to the THR to be converted in to a serial data stream including start-bit, data bits, \nparity-bit and stop-bit(s). The least-si gnificant-bit (Bit-0) becomes first data  bit to go out. The THR is the input \nregister to the transmit FIFO of 64 bytes when FIFO operation is enabl ed by FCR bit-0.

The THR empty flag (LSR bit-5) is set when the \ndata byte is transferred to TSR. THR flag can generate a tr ansmit empty interrupt (ISR bit-1) when it is enabled \nby IER bit-1.

T he THR empty flag (LSR bit-5) is set \nwhenever the FIFO is empty. The THR empty flag can ge nerate a transmit empty interrupt (ISR bit-1) when the \namount of data in the FIFO falls below its programmed trig ger level. The transmit empty interrupt is enabled by \nIER bit-1. The TSR flag (LSR bit-6) is set when TSR/FIFO becomes empty.\n \n2.8 Receiver\nThe receiver section contains an 8-bit Receive Shift Register (RSR) and 64 bytes of FIFO which includes a \nbyte-wide Receive Holding Regi ster (RHR). The RSR uses the 16X for ti ming. It verifies and validates every bit \non the incoming character in the middle of each data bit.  On the falling edge of a start or false start bit, an \ninternal receiver counter star ts counting at the 16X. After 8 clocks the start bit period should be at the center of \nthe start bit. At this time the start bit is sampled and if it is still a logic 0 it is validated. Evaluati ng the start bit in \nthis manner prevents the receiver from assembling a false ch aracter. The rest of the data bits and stop bits are \nsampled and validated in this same manner to prevent false framing. If there were any error(s), they are reported in the LSR register bits 2-4.  Upon unloading the receive data byte from RHR, the receive FIFO pointer \nis bumped and the error tags are immediately updated to reflect the status of the data byte in RHR register. \nRHR can generate a receive data ready interrupt upon receiv ing a character or delay until it reaches the FIFO \ntrigger level. Furthermore, data delivery to the host is guaranteed by a receive data ready time-out interrupt \nwhen data is not received for 4 word lengths as defined by  LCR[1:0] plus 12 bits time . This is equivalent to 3.7-\n4.6 character times. The RHR interrupt is enabled by IER bit-0.FIGURE  6.  T RANSMITTER  OPERATION  IN NON-FIFO M ODE\nFIGURE  7.

It provides the receive data interface to the host processor. The RHR register is part of the receive FIFO of 64 bytes by 11-bits wide, the 3 extra bits are fo r the 3 error tags to be reported in LSR register. When \nthe FIFO is enabled by FCR bit-0, the RHR contains the first data character received by the FIFO.

The THR and \nRHR for channels 0 to 7 are located at address 0x 00, 0x10, 0x20, 0x30, 0x40, 0x50, 0x60 and 0x70 \nrespectively. Transmit data byte is loaded to the TH R when writing to that address and receive data is \nunloaded from the RHR register when reading that address. Both THR and RHR registers are 16C550 compatible in 8-bit format, so each bus operation can only write or read in bytes.\n.\n2.10 Automatic RTS/DTR Hardwa re Flow Control Operation\nAutomatic RTS/DTR flow control is used to prevent dat a overrun to the local receiver FIFO. The RTS#/DTR# \noutput pin is used to request remote unit to suspend/ resume data transmission.

The RTS# output pin will be asse rted (LOW) again after the FIFO \nis unloaded to the next trigger level below the programmed trigger level.

A UTO RTS/DTR AND CTS/DSR F LOW CONTROL  OPERATION\nThe local UART (UARTA) starts data transfer by asserting RTSA# (1). RTSA# is normally connected to CTSB# (2) of \nremote UART (UARTB). CTSB# allows its transmitter to se nd data (3). TXB data arrives and fills UARTA receive FIFO \n(4). When RXA data fills up to its receive FIFO trigger le vel, UARTA activates its RXA data ready interrupt (5) and con -\ntinues to receive and put data into its FIFO. If interrupt se rvice latency is long and data is not being unloaded, UARTA \nmonitors its receive data fill level to match the upper thre shold of RTS delay and de-assert RTSA# (6). CTSB# follows \n(7) and request UARTB transmitter to suspend data transfer. UA RTB stops or finishes sending the data bits in its trans -\nmit shift register (8). When receive FIFO data in UARTA is  unloaded to match the lower threshold of RTS delay (9), \nUARTA re-asserts RTSA# (10), CTSB# recognizes the change (11)  and restarts its transmitter and data flow again until \nnext receive FIFO trigger (12). This same event applies to the reverse direction when UARTA sends data to UARTB \nwith RTSB# and CTSA# controlling the data flow.RTSA# CTSB#RXA TXBTransmitterReceiver FIFO\nTrigger Reached\nAuto RTS\nTrigger LevelAuto CTS\nMonitor\nRTSA#\nTXB\nRXA FIFOCTSB#Remote UART\nUARTBLocal UART\nUARTA\nONOFFON\nSuspendRestart\nRTS High\nThresholdData StartsONOFFONAssert RTS# to Begin\nTransmission1\n2\n3\n4\n567\nReceive\nDataRTS Low\nThreshold910\n11Receiver FIFO\nTrigger Reached\nAuto RTS\nTrigger LevelTransmitter\nAuto CTS\nMonitorRTSB# CTSA#RXB TXA\nINTA\n(RXA FIFO\nInterrupt)RX FIFO\nTrigger LevelRX FIFO\nTrigger Level8\n12\nRTSCTS1\nXR16L788  \n16HIGH PERFORMANCE 2.97V TO 5.5V OCTAL UART REV. 1.2.3\n2.11 Auto Xon/Xoff (Software) Flow Control\nWhen software flow control is enabled ( See Table  18), the 788 compares one or two sequential receive data \ncharacters with the programmed Xon or Xoff-1,2 charac ter value(s). If receive character(s) (RX) match the \nprogrammed values, the 788 will halt tr ansmission (TX) as soon as th e current characte r has completed \ntransmission. When a match occurs, the Xoff (if enabled vi a IER bit-5) flag will be set and the interrupt output \npin will be activated. Following a su spension due to a match of the Xoff  character, the 788 will monitor the \nreceive data stream for a match to the Xon-1,2 character. If a match is  found, the 788 will resume operation \nand clear the flags (ISR bit-4). \nReset initially sets the contents of the Xon/Xoff 8-bit flow control registers to a logic 0. Following reset, any \ndesired Xon/Xoff value can be used for so ftware flow control. Different condit ions can be set to  detect Xon/Xoff \ncharacters ( See Table  18) and suspend/resume transmissions. When double 8-bit Xon/Xoff characters are \nselected, the 788 compares two consec utive receive characters with two software flow control 8-bit values \n(Xon1, Xon2, Xoff1, Xoff2) and controls TX transmissi ons accordingly. Under the above described flow control \nmechanisms, flow control characters are not placed (sta cked) in the user accessible RX data buffer or FIFO. \nIn the event that the receive buffer is overfilling and flow control needs to  be executed, the 788 automatically \nsends an Xoff message (when enabled) via the serial TX output to the remote modem. The 788 sends the Xoff-1,2 characters two character times (= time taken to send two characters at the programmed baud rate) after the receive FIFO crosses the programmed trigger level (for  all trigger tables A-D). To clear this condition, the \n788 will transmit the programmed Xon-1,2 characters as soon as receive FI FO is less than one trigger level \nbelow the programmed trigger le vel (for Trigger Tables A, B, and C) or when receive FIFO is less than the \ntrigger level minus the hysteresis value (for Trigger Tabl e D). This hysteresis value is the same as the Auto \nRTS/DTR Hysteresis value in \nTable  17.  Table  6 below explains this when Trigger Table-B (See Table  14) is \nselected.\n* After the trigger level is reached, an xoff character is se nt after a short span of time (= time required to send 2\n characters); for example, after 2.083ms has el apsed for 9600 baud and 10-bit word length setting.\n2.12  Special Character Detect \nA special character detect feature is provided to detect an 8-bit character when bit-5 is set in the Enhanced \nFeature Register (EFR).  When this character (Xoff2) is detected, it  will be placed in the FI FO along with normal \nincoming RX data. \nThe 788 compares each inco ming receive character with Xo ff-2 data. If a match exists, the received data will \nbe transferred to FIFO and IS R bit-4 will be set to indicate detection of special character. Al though the Internal \nRegister Table shows Xon, Xoff Registers with eight bits of character information, the actual number of bits is dependent on the programmed word lengt h. Line Control Register (LCR) bits 0-1 defines the number of \ncharacter bits, i.e., either 5 bits, 6 bits, 7 bits, or 8 bits. The word length selected by LCR bits 0-1 also determines the number of bits that  will be used for the special character comparison. Bit-0 in the Xon, Xoff \nRegisters corresponds with the LS B bit for the receive character.\n2.13  Auto RS485 Half-duplex Control\nThe auto RS485 half-duplex direction control changes the behavior of the transmitter when enabled by FCTR \nbit-5. It asserts RTS# or DTR# (LOW) after a specified delay indicate d in MSR[7:4] following  the last stop bit of \nthe last character that has been transm itted. This helps in turning around the transceiver to receive the remote \nstation’s response. The delay optimizes the time needed fo r the last transmission to reach the farthest station \non a long cable network before switching off the li ne driver. This delay prevents undesirable line signal TABLE  6: A UTO XON/XOFF (SOFTWARE ) FLOW CONTROL\nRX T RIGGER  LEVEL INT P IN ACTIVATIONXOFF CHARACTER (S) SENT \n(CHARACTERS  IN RX FIFO)XON CHARACTER (S) SENT \n(CHARACTERS  IN RX FIFO)\n8 8 8* 0\n16 16 16* 8\n24 24 24* 16\n28 28 28* 24\n XR16L788\n17REV. 1.2.3 HIGH PERFORMANCE 2.97V TO 5.5V OCTAL UART\ndisturbance that causes sig nal degradation. When the ho st is ready to transmit ne xt polling data packet again, \nit only has to load data bytes to the transmit FIFO. The transmitter automatically de-asserts RTS# or DTR# \noutput (HIGH) prior to sending the data. The auto RS485 half-duplex direction control also changes the \ntransmitter empty interrupt to TSR empty instead of THR empty.\n2.14 Infrared Mode \nEach UART in the 788 includes the infrared encoder and decoder compatible to the IrDA (Infrared Data \nAssociation) version 1.0. The input pin ENIR conveniently activates all 8 UART channels to start up in the \ninfrared mode. Note that the ENIR pin is sampled when the RST# input is de-asserted.  This global control pin \nenables the MCR bit-6 function in every UART channel re gister. After power up or a reset, the software can \noverwrite MCR bit-6 if so desired. ENIR and MCR bit- 6 also disable the receiver while the transmitter is \nsending data. This prevents echoed data from reaching  the receiver. The global activation ENIR pin prevents \nthe infrared emitter from turning on and drawing large amount of current while the system is starting up. When the infrared feature is enabled, the transmit data outputs, TX[7:0], would idle at logi c zero level. Likewise, the \nRX [7:0] inputs assume an idle level of  logic zero. \nThe infrared encoder sends out a  3/16 of a bit wide HIGH-pulse for each “0” bit in the transmit data stream. \nThis signal encoding reduces the on-time of the infr ared LED, hence reduces the power consumption. See\nFigure  11 below.\nThe infrared decoder receives the input pulse from the in frared sensing diode on RX pin. Each time it senses a \nlight pulse, it returns a logic zero to the data bit st ream. The decoder also accepts (when FCTR bit-4 = 1) an \ninverted IR-encoded input signal. This option supports active low instead of normal active high pulse from \nsome infrared modules on the market.\nFIGURE  11.

User can che ck the XTAL2 pin for no \nclock output as an indication that the device has entered the sleep mode.\nThe 788 resumes normal operation by any of the following: \n■a receive data start bit transition (HIGH to LOW) \n■a data byte is loaded to the transmitter, THR or FIFO \n■a change of logic state on any of the modem or general purpose serial inputs: CTS#, DSR#, CD#, RI# \nIf the 788 is awakened by any one of the above conditi ons, it will return to  the sleep mode au tomatically after \nall interrupting conditions have been serviced and clea red. If the 788 is awakened by the modem inputs, a read \nto the MSR is required to reset th e modem inputs. In any ca se, the sleep mode will not  be entered while an \ninterrupt is pending in any channel. Also, a special in terrupt is generated with an indication of no pending \ninterrupt. Reading INT0 will cl ear this special interrupt.  The 788 will stay  in the sleep mode of operation until it \nis disabled by setting SLEEP = 0x00.\nA word of caution: owing to the star ting up delay of the crystal oscillato r after waking up from sleep mode, the \nfirst few receive characters may be lost. The number of ch aracters lost during the restart also depends on your \noperating data rate. More characters are lost when operating at higher data rate. \n XR16L788\n19REV. 1.2.3 HIGH PERFORMANCE 2.97V TO 5.5V OCTAL UART\n2.16 Internal Loopback\nEach UART channel provides an in ternal loopback capabilit y for system diagnostic pu rposes. The internal \nloopback mode  is enabled by setting MCR register bit-4 to logi c 1. All regular UART functions operate normally. \nFigure  12 shows how the modem port signals are re-configured. Transmit data from the transmit shift register \noutput is internally routed to the receive shift register input allowing the system to re ceive the same data that it \nwas sending. The TX pin is held at HIGH or mark condition while RTS# and DT R# are de-asserted (HIGH), \nand CTS#, DSR# CD# and RI# inputs are ignored.\nFIGURE  12.

These fu nctions include all 8 channel UART’s interrupt control and status, 16-bit \ngeneral purpose timer control and status, sleep mode, soft -reset, and device identifi cation and revision. Also, \neach UART channel has its own set of internal UART Configuration Registers  for its own operation control, \nstatus reporting and data transfer. These registers ar e mapped into a 256-byte of the data memory address \nspace. The following paragraphs describe all the registers in detail.\n \n3.1 DEVICE CONFIGURATION REGISTER SET\nThe device configuration registers are directly accessi ble from the bus. This provides easy programming of \ngeneral operating parameters to the 788 UART and for mo nitoring the status of various functions. The device \nconfiguration registers are mapped onto address 0x80-8F as shown on the register map in Table  8 and \nFigure  13.

The four registers are in the device configuration register address space. \nAll four registers default to logic zero (as indicated in square braces) for no interrupt pending. All 8 channel \ninterrupts are enabled or disabled in each channel’s IER register. INT0 shows individual status for each \nchannel while INT1, INT2 and INT3 show the details of the source of each channel’s interrupt with its unique 3-\nbit encoding. Figure  14 shows the 4 interrupt registers in sequence for clarity. The 16-bit timer and sleep \nwake-up interrupts are masked in the device configuration registers, TIMERCNTL and SLEEP. An interrupt is \ngenerated by the 788 when awakened from sleep if all 8 channels were placed in the sleep mode previously. \nReading INT0 will clear th is wake-up interrupt.\nEach bit gives an indication of the channel that has requested for service. For example, bit-0 represents \nchannel 0 and bit-7 indicates channel 7. Logic one indicates the channel N [7:0] has called for service. The interrupt bit clears after reading the appropriate register  of the interrupting UART channel register (ISR, LSR \nand MSR). \nSee Table  13 for interrupt clearing details.\n3.1.1.1 INT0 Channel Interrupt Indicator:\n3.1.1.2 INT1, INT2 and INT3 Interrupt Source Locator\nINT3, INT2 and INT1 provide a 24-bit (3 bits per channel) encoded interrupt indicator. Table  9 shows the 3 bit \nencoding and their priority or der. The 16-bit Timer time-out interrupt will show up only as a channel  0 interrupt. \nFor other channels, interrupt 7 is reserved.\n.INT3\n[0x00]INT2\n[0x00]INT1\n[0x00]INT0\n[0x00]\nFIGURE  14.

The timer can be set to  be a single-shot fo r a one-time event or \nre-triggerable for a periodic event. An\ninterrupt may be generated in the INT Register when the timer times out. It is controlled through 4 configuration \nregisters [TIMERCNTL, TIMER, TIMELSB, TIMERMSB]. Th ese registers provide start/stop and re-triggerable \nor one-shot operation.

All registers in that \nchannel will be reset to th e default condition, see Table  19 for details. As an example, bit-0 =1 resets UART \nchannel 0 with bit-7=1 resets channel 7.\n3.1.6 SLEEP [7:0] (default 0x00)\nThe 8-bit Sleep register enables each UART separately to enter Sleep mode. Sleep mode reduces power \nconsumption when the system needs to put the UART(s) to  idle. The UART enters sleep mode when there is \nno interrupt pending. When all 8 UART s are put to sleep, the on-chip osc illator shuts off to further conserve \npower. In this case, the octal UART is awaken by any of the UART channel on from a receive data byte or a \nchange on the serial port. The UART is ready after 32 crystal clocks  to ensure full functiona lity. Also, a special \ninterrupt is generated with an indication of no pendin g interrupt. Logic 0 (default) and logic 1 disable and \nenable sleep mode respectively.\n3.1.7 Device Identification and Revision \nThere are 2 internal registers that provide device iden tification and revision, DVID  and DREV registers. The 8-\nbit content in the DVID register provides device identifica tion. A return value of 0x28 from this register indicates \nthe device is a XR16L788. The DREV register returns a 8-bi t value of 0x01 for revision A, 0x02 for revision B \nand so on. This information is very useful to the softwa re driver for identifying whic h device it is communicating \nwith and to keep up with revision changes.\n3.1.7.1 DVID [7:0] (default 0x28)\nDevice identification for the type of UART.

These inte rrupts are reported in the Interrupt Status Register (ISR) register and \nalso encoded in INT (INT0-INT3) register in the Device Configuration Registers. \n4.3.1 IER versus Receive FIFO Interrupt Mode Operation\nWhen the receive FIFO (FCR BIT-0 = a logic 1) and rece ive interrupts (IER BIT-0 = logic 1) are enabled, the \nRHR interrupts (see ISR bits 3 and 4) status will reflect the following:\nA.The receive data available interrupts are issued to the host when the FIFO has reached the programmed \ntrigger level. It will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the programmed trigger level.\nB.FIFO level will be reflected in the ISR register when the FIFO trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register \nstatus bit and the interrupt will be cleared wh en the FIFO drops below the trigger level.\nC.The receive data ready bit (LSR BIT-0) is set as soon as  a character is transferred from the shift register to \nthe receive FIFO. It is rese t when the FIFO is empty.\n4.3.2 IER versus Receive/Transmit  FIFO Polled Mode Operation\nWhen FCR BIT-0 equals a logic 1 for FIFO enable; resetting IER bits 0-3 enables the XR16L788 in the FIFO \npolled mode of operation. Since the receiver and transmitter have separate bits in the LSR either or both can be used in the polled mode by selecting respective transmit or receive control bit(s).\nA.LSR BIT-0 indicates there is data in RHR  or RX FIFO.\nB.LSR BIT-1 indicates an overrun error has occurred and that data in the FIFO may not be valid.\nC.LSR BIT 2-4 provides the type of receive data erro rs encountered for the data byte in RHR, if any.\nD.LSR BIT-5 indicates THR is empty.\nE.LSR BIT-6 indicates when both the transmit FIFO and TSR are empty.\nF.LSR BIT-7 indicates a data error in at least one character in the RX FIFO.1 0 1 1 RXCNT R Bit-7 Bit-6 Bit-5 Bit-4 Bit-3 Bit-2 Bit-1 Bit-0\n1 0 1 1 RXTRG W Bit-7 Bit-6 Bit-5 Bit-4 Bit-3 Bit-2 Bit-1 Bit-0\n1 1 0 0 XCHAR R 0 0 0 0 0 0 Xon Det. \nIndicatorXoff Det. \nIndicatorSelf-clear \nafter read\n1 1 0 0 XOFF1 W Bit-7 Bit-6 Bit-5 Bit-4 Bit-3 Bit-2 Bit-1 Bit-0\n1 1 0 1 XOFF2 W Bit-7 Bit-6 Bit-5 Bit-4 Bit-3 Bit-2 Bit-1 Bit-0\n1 1 1 0 XON1 W Bit-7 Bit-6 Bit-5 Bit-4 Bit-3 Bit-2 Bit-1 Bit-0\n1 1 1 1 XON2 W Bit-7 Bit-6 Bit-5 Bit-4 Bit-3 Bit-2 Bit-1 Bit-0TABLE  12: UART CHANNEL CONFIGURATI ON REGISTERS DESCRIPTION.

In  this mode any RX character re ceived will enable Xon, resume data \ntransmission. \nMCR[6]: Infrared Encoder/Decoder Enable\nThe state of this bit depends on the sampled logic level of pin ENIR during power up, following a hardware \nreset (rising edge of RST# input). Afterward user can override this bit for desired operation. \n•Logic 0 = Enable the standard modem receive and transmit character interface.\n•Logic 1 = Enable infrared IrDA receive and transmit inputs/outputs. While in this mode, the TX/RX output/\ninput are routed to the in frared encoder/ decoder. The data input and output  levels will confor m to the IrDA \ninfrared interf ace requirement. As such, while in this mode the infrared TX ou tput will be a logic 0 during idle \ndata conditions. FCTR bit-4 may be selected to invert the RX input signal level going to the decoder for infrared modules that provide rather an inverted output. \nMCR[7]: Clock Prescaler Select\n•Logic 0 = Divide by one. The input clock from the crystal or external clock is fed directly to the Programmable \nBaud Rate Generator without further modification, i.e., divide by one (default).\n•Logic 1 = Divide by four. The prescaler divides the input clock from the crystal or external clock by four and \nfeeds it to the Programmable Baud Rate Generator, hence, data rates become one forth. \nXR16L788  \n36HIGH PERFORMANCE 2.97V TO 5.5V OCTAL UART REV. 1.2.3\n4.8 Line Status Register (LSR) - Read Only\nThis register provides the status of data transfers between the UART and the host.  If IER bit-2 is set to a logic \n1, an LSR interrupt will be generated immediately when any character in the RX FIFO has an error (parity, framing, overrun, break).\nLSR[0]: Receive Data Ready Indicator\n•Logic 0 = No data in receive holding register or FIFO (default).\n•Logic 1 = Data has been received and is save d in the receive holding register or FIFO. \nLSR[1]: Receiver Overrun Flag\n•Logic 0 = No overrun error (default).\n•Logic 1 = Overrun error. A data overrun error condition occurred in the receive shift register. This happens \nwhen additional data arrives while the FI FO is full. In this case the previous  data in the receive shift register \nis overwritten. Note that under this condition the data byte in the receive shift register is not transferred into \nthe FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error. \nLSR[2]: Receive Data Parity Error Flag\n•Logic 0 = No parity error (default).\n•Logic 1 = Parity error. The receive character in RHR does not have correct pa rity information and is suspect. \nThis error is associated with the char acter available for reading in RHR.\nLSR[3]: Receive Data Framing Error Flag\n•Logic 0 = No framing error (default).\n•Logic 1 = Framing error. The receive character did not hav e a valid stop bit(s). This error is associated with \nthe character available for reading in RHR.\nLSR[4]: Receive Break Flag\n•Logic 0 = No break condition (default).\n•Logic 1 = The receiver received a break signal (RX was a logic 0 for one character frame time). In the FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded into the FIFO. The break indication remains until the RX input \nreturns to the idle condit ion, “mark” or logic 1. \nLSR[5]: Transmit Holding Register Empty Flag\nThis bit is the Transmit Holding Regi ster Empty indicator. This bit indica tes that the transmitter is ready to \naccept a new character for transmission. In addition, this  bit causes the UART to issue an interrupt to the host \nwhen the THR inte rrupt enable is set. The THR bit is  set to a logic 1 when the last data byte is transferred from \nthe transmit holding register to the transmit shift regist er. The bit is reset to logic 0 concurrently with the data \nloading to the transmit holding register by the host. In th e FIFO mode this bit is set when the transmit FIFO is \nempty; it is cleared when at least 1 byte is written to the transmit FIFO.\nLSR[6]: Transmit Shift Register Empty Flag\nThis bit is the Transmit Shift Register Empty indicator. Th is bit is set to a logic 1 whenever the transmitter goes \nidle. It is set to logic 0 whenever either the THR or TSR contains a data character. In the FIFO mode this bit is \nset to one whenever the transmit FIFO and transmit shift register are both empty.\nLSR[7]: Receive FIFO Data Error Flag\n•Logic 0 = No FIFO error (default).\n•Logic 1 = An indicator for the sum of all error bits in th e RX FIFO. At least one parity error, framing error or \nbreak indication is in the FIFO data. This bit cl ears when there is no more error(s) in the FIFO. \n4.9 Modem Status Register (MSR) - Read Only\nThis register provides the current state of the modem interface signals, or othe r peripheral device that the \nUART is connected. Lower four bits of this register are used to indicate the changed information. These bits \nare set to a logic 1 whenever a signal from the modem changes state. These bits may be used as general \npurpose inputs/outputs when they  are not used with modem signals.\n XR16L788\n37REV. 1.2.3 HIGH PERFORMANCE 2.97V TO 5.5V OCTAL UART\nMSR[0]: Delta CTS# Input Flag\n•Logic 0 = No change on CTS# input (default).\n•Logic 1 = The CTS# input has changed state since the la st time it was monitored.

A modem status interrupt \nwill be generated if MSR interr upt is enabled (IER bit-3.\nMSR[2]: Delta RI# Input Flag\n•Logic 0 = No change on RI# input (default).\n•Logic 1 = The RI# input has changed from a logic 0 to a logic 1, ending of the ringi ng signal. A modem status \ninterrupt will be ge nerated if MSR in terrupt is enabled (IER bit-3.\nMSR[3]: Delta CD# Input Flag\n•Logic 0 = No change on CD# input (default).\n•Logic 1 = Indicates that the CD# input has changed st ate since the last time it was monitored. A modem \nstatus interrupt will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3.\nMSR[4]: CTS Input Status\nCTS# pin may function as automatic hardware flow control signal input if it is enabled and selected by Auto \nCTS (EFR bit-7) and RTS/CTS flow control select (M CR bit-2). Auto CTS flow control allows starting and \nstopping of local data transmission s based on the modem CT S# signal. A HIGH on the CTS# pin will stop \nUART transmitter as soon as th e current character has finished tr ansmission, and a LOW will resume data \ntransmission. Normally MSR bit-4 bit is the complement of  the CTS# input. However in the loopback mode, this \nbit is equivalent to the RTS# bit in the MCR register. The CTS# input may be used as a general purpose input \nwhen the modem interface is not used.\nMSR[5]: DSR Input Status\nThis input may be used for auto DTR/ DSR flow control function, see auto hardware flow control section. \nNormally this bit is the complement of the DSR# input. In the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to the DTR# \nbit in the MCR register. The DSR# input may be used as  a general purpose input when the modem interface is \nnot used.\nMSR[6]: RI Input Status\nNormally this bit is the complement of the RI# input. In the loop back mode this bit is equivalent to bit-2 in the \nMCR register. The RI# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.\nMSR[7]: CD Input Status\nNormally this bit is the complement of  the CD# input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to bit-3 in the \nMCR register. The CD# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.\n4.10 Modem Status Register (MSR) - Write Only\nThe upper four bits 4-7 of this register sets the delay in number of bits time for the auto RS485 turn around \nfrom transmit to receive.\nMSR [7:4]\nWhen Auto RS485 feature is enabled (FCTR bit-5=1) and  RTS# output is connected to the enable input of a \nRS-485 transceiver. These 4 bits select from 0 to 15 bit-time  delay after the end of the last stop-bit of the last \ntransmitted character. This delay controls when to change th e state of RTS# output. This delay is very useful in \nlong-cable networks. Table  16 shows the selection.

However, if flow  control is set for comparing Xon2, Xoff 2 (EFR[1:0]=01) then flow control works \nnormally, but Xoff2 will not go to the FIFO, and will ge nerate an Xoff  interrupt and a special character \ninterrupt.\nEFR[6]: Auto RTS or DTR Flow Control Enable\nRTS#/DTR# output may be used for hardware flow contro l by setting EFR bit-6 to logic 1. When Auto RTS/\nDTR is selected, an in terrupt will be gener ated when the receive FIFO is f illed to the progra mmed trigger level \nand RTS/DTR# will de-assert (HIGH) at the next upper trigger or selected hysteresis level.  RTS/DTR# will re-\nassert (LOW) when FIFO data falls below the next lower trigger or selected hysteres is level (see FCTR bits 4-\n7). The RTS# or DTR# output must be asserted (LOW) before the auto RTS/DTR can take effect. The selection \nfor RTS# or DTR# is through MCR bit-2. RTS/DTR#  pin will function as a gene ral purpose output when \nhardware flow control is disabled.\n•Logic 0 = Automatic RTS/DTR flow control is disabled (default).\n•Logic 1 = Enable Automatic RTS/DTR flow control. \nEFR[7]: Auto CTS Flow Control Enable\nAutomatic CTS or DSR Flow Control.\n•Logic 0 = Automatic CTS/DSR flow control is disabled (default).\n•Logic 1 = Enable Automatic CTS/DSR flow control. Transmission stops when CTS/DSR# pin de-asserts \n(HIGH). Transmission resumes when CT S/DSR# pin is asserted (LOW). Th e selection for CTS# or DSR# is \nthrough MCR bit-2. \n4.14 TXCNT[7:0]: Transmit FIFO Level Counter - Read Only\nTransmit FIFO level byte count from 0x00 (zero) to 0x40  (64). This 8-bit register gives an indication of the \nnumber of characters in the transmit FIFO. The FIFO le vel Byte count register is read only. The user can take \nadvantage of the FIFO level byte counter for faster data loading to the transmit FIFO., which reduces CPU \nbandwidth requirements.\n4.15 TXTRG [7:0]: Transmit FI FO Trigger Level - Write Only\nAn 8-bit value written to this register sets the TX FIFO  trigger level from 0x00 (zero) to 0x40 (64). The TX FIFO \ntrigger level generates an interrupt whenever the data leve l in the transmit FIFO falls  below this preset trigger \nlevel.\nXR16L788  \n42HIGH PERFORMANCE 2.97V TO 5.5V OCTAL UART REV. 1.2.3\n4.16 RXCNT[7:0]: Receive FIFO Level Counter - Read Only\nReceive FIFO level byte count from 0x00 (zero) to 0x40 (64). It gives an indication of the number of characters \nin the receive FIFO. The FIFO level byte count register is read only. The user can take advantage of the FIFO \nlevel byte counter for faster data unloading from  the receiver FIFO, which reduces CPU bandwidth \nrequirements.\n4.17 RXTRG[7:0]: Receive FIFO Trigger Level - Write Only\nAn 8-bit value written to this register, sets the RX FIFO trigger level from 0x00 (zero) to 0x40 (64).
