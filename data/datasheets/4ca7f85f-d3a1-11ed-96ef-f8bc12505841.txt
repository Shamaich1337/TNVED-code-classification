Application information\nThe device is designed for the protection of one bidirectional data line from surge pulses and ESD\ndamage. The device is suitable on lines where the signal polarities are both positive and negative\nwith respect to ground.\nThe device uses an advanced clamping structure showing a negative dynamic resistance.\nThis snap-back behavior strongly reduces the clamping voltage to the system behind the ESD\nprotection during an ESD event.

Application diagram\nCircuit board layout and protection device placement\nCircuit board layout is critical for the suppression of ESD, Electrical Fast Transient (EFT) and surge\ntransients. The following guidelines are recommended:\n1.Place the device as close to the input terminal or connector as possible.\n2.Minimize the path length between the device and the protected line.\n3.Keep parallel signal paths to a minimum.\n4.Avoid running protected conductors in parallel with unprotected conductors.\n5.Minimize all Printed-Circuit Board (PCB) conductive loops including power and ground loops.\n6.Minimize the length of the transient return path to ground.\n7.Avoid using shared transient return paths to a common ground point.\n8.Use ground planes whenever possible. For multilayer PCBs, use ground vias.\n11.
