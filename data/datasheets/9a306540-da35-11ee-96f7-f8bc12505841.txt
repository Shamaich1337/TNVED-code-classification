Functional description\nThe PCA82C250 is the interfac e between a CAN protocol controller and the physical bus. \nIt is primarily intended for high-speed automot ive applications (up to 1 MBd). The device \nprovides differential transmit capability to the bus and differential receive capability to the \nCAN controller. It is fully compatible with the “ISO 11898”  standard.\nA current limiting circuit protects the transmitter output stage against short-circuit to \npositive and negative battery voltage. Although  the power dissipation is increased during \nthis fault condition, this feature will prevent destruction of the transmitter output stage.\nIf the junction temperature exceeds a value of approximately 160 \uf0b0C, the limiting current \nof both transmitter outputs is decreased. Because the transmitter is responsible for the \nmajor part of the power dissipation, this will result in reduced powe r dissipation and hence \na lower chip temperature. All other parts of  the PCA82C250 will remain  in operation. The \nthermal protection is needed, in partic ular, when a bus line is short-circuited.\nThe CANH and CANL lines are also protected against electrical transients which may \noccur in an automotive environment.\nPin 8 (Rs) allows three different modes of operation to be selected: High-speed, Slope \ncontrol and Standby.\nFor high-speed operation, the transmitter output transistors are simply switched on and off \nas fast as possible. In this mode, no measures are taken to limit the rise and fall slope. \nUse of a shielded cable is recommended to avoid RFI problems. The High-speed mode is \nselected by connecting pin 8 to ground.\nFor lower speeds or shorter bus length, an un shielded twisted pair or a parallel pair of \nwires can be used for the bus. To reduce RFI, the rise and fall slope should be limited. The \nrise and fall slope can be programmed with a resistor connected from pin 8 to ground. The slope is proportional to the current output at pin 8.\nIf a HIGH level is applied to pin 8, the circuit enters a low-current Standby mode. In this \nmode, the transmitter is switched off and the receiver is switched to a low current. If \ndominant bits are detected (differential bus voltage >0.9 V), RXD will be switched to a Table 3.

Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n14.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n14.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n14.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhe sive and flux, clinching of leads, board \ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are \nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\nPCA89C250 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2011. All rights reserved.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 06 — 25 August 2011 13 of 18NXP Semiconductors PCA82C250\nCAN controller interface\n14.4 Reflow soldering\nKey characteristics in reflow soldering are:\n•Lead-free versus SnPb solderi ng; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to \nhigher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 13 ) than a SnPb process, thus \nreducing the process window\n•Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process \nwindow for a mix of large and small components on one board\n•Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is \nheated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 9  and 10\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 13 .Table 9.

#### Description:
The PCA82C250 is a CAN transceiver designed to interface between a CAN protocol controller and the physical CAN bus. It provides differential transmit and receive capabilities, ensuring robust communication in automotive and industrial applications. The device is engineered to handle high-speed data transmission while maintaining compliance with the ISO 11898 standard, which governs CAN communication.

#### Typical Applications:
The PCA82C250 is primarily used in high-speed automotive applications, where reliable communication is critical. Typical applications include:
- Automotive networking systems (e.g., engine control units, body control modules)
- Industrial automation systems
- Robotics and machinery control
- Any application requiring robust, high-speed communication over a CAN bus

This component is particularly suited for environments where electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electrical transients are prevalent, thanks to its built-in protections and high common-mode range.
