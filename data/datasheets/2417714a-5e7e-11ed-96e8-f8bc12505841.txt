These modules integrate\noptimized gate drive of the built −in IGBTs to minimize EMI and\nlosses, while also providing multiple on −module protection features:\nunder−voltage lockouts, over −current shutdown, temperature sensing,\nand fault reporting. The built −in, high−speed HVIC requires only\na single supply voltage and translates the incoming logic − level gate\ninputs to high−voltage, high −current drive signals to properly drive the\nmodule’s internal IGBTs.

Use the shunt resistor R 4 of surface mounted\n(SMD) type to reduce wiring inductance. To prevent malfunction, wiring of point E should be connected to the terminal of the sh unt resistor\nR4 as close as possible.\n20.To insert the shunt resistor to measure each phase current at N U, NV, NW terminal, it makes to change the trip level I SC about the short −ciruit\ncurrent.\n21.To prevent errors of the protection function, the wiring of points B, C, and D should be as short as possible. The wiring of  B between C SC\nfilter and R SC terminal should be divided at the point that is close to the terminal of sense resistor R 5.\n22.For stable protection function, use the sense resistor R 5 with resistance variation within 1% and low inductance value.\n23.In the short −circuit protection circuit, select the R 6C6 time constant in the range 1.0 ~ 1.5 /C0109s. R6 should be selected with a minimum of 10 times\nlarger resistance than sense resistor R 5. Do enough evaluaiton on the real system because short −circuit protection time may vary wiring\npattern layout and value of the R 6C6 time constant.\n24.Each capacitor should be mounted as close to the pins of the Motion SPM 2 product as possible.\n25.To prevent surge destruction, the wiring between the smoothing capacitor C 7 and the P & GND pins should be as short as possible. The use\nof a high −frequency non −inductive capacitor of around 0.1 ~ 0.22 /C0109F between the P & GND pins is recommended.\n26.Relays are used at almost every systems of electrical equipments at industrial application. In these cases, there should be sufficient  distance\nbetween the CPU and the relays.\n27.The zener diode or transient voltage suppressor should be adopted for the protection of ICs from the surge destruction betwe en each pair\nof control supply terminals (recommanded Zener diode is 22 V / 1 W, which has the lower zener impedance characteristic than abo ut 15 /C8201Ω).\n28.C 2 of around 7 times larger than bootstrap capacitor C 3 is recommended.\n29.Please choose the electrolytic capacitor with good temperature characteristic in C 3. Also, choose 0.1 ~ 0.2 /C0109F R−category ceramic capacitors\nwith good temperature and frequency characteristics in C 4.\nFNA23512A\nwww. onsemi.com\n14PACKAGE MARKING AND ORDERING INFORMATION \nDevice Device Marking Package Packing Quantity\nFNA23512A FNA23512A SPMCA−A34 Rail 6\nSPM is registered trademark of Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC dba “ onsemi ” or its affiliates and/or subsidiaries in the United States and/or\nother countries.\nSPMCA−A34 / 34LD, PDD STD, DBC DIP TYPE\nCASE MODFQ\nISSUE O\nDATE 31 JAN 2017MECHANICAL CASE OUTLINE\nPACKAGE DIMENSIONS\nON Semiconductor and          are trademarks of Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC dba ON Semiconductor or its subsidiari es in the United States and/or other countries.\nON Semiconductor reserves the right to make changes without further notice to any products herein.
