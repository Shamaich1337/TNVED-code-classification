amplifier with integrated output common mode control,\ndesigned toprovide low distortion amplification towide bandwidth differential signals. The common mode\nfeedback circuit sets theoutput common mode voltage independent oftheinput common mode, aswell as\nforcing theV+andV−outputs tobeequal inmagnitude andopposite inphase, even when only oneoftheinputs\nisdriven asinsingle todifferential conversion.\nThe proprietary current feedback architecture oftheLMH6554 offers gain and bandwidth independence with\nexceptional gain flatness andnoise performance, even athigh values ofgain, simply with theappropriate choice\nofRF1 andRF2. Generally RF1 issetequal toRF2, andRG1 equal toRG2, sothatthegain issetbytheratio\nRF/RG.

Inorder togetmaximum benefit from thedifferential\ncircuit architecture board layout and component selection isvery critical. The circuit board should have alow\ninductance ground plane andwell bypassed broad supply lines. External components should beleadless surface\nmount types. The feedback network and output matching resistors should becomposed ofshort traces and\nprecision resistors (0.1%). The output matching resistors should beplaced within 3or4mm oftheamplifier as\nshould thesupply bypass capacitors. Refer toPower Supply Bypassing forrecommendations onbypass circuit\nlayout. Evaluation boards areavailable through theproduct folder onti.com .\nBydesign, theLMH6554 isrelatively insensitive toparasitic capacitance atitsinputs. Nonetheless, ground and\npower plane metal should beremoved from beneath theamplifier and from beneath RFand RGforbest\nperformance athigh frequency.\nWith anydifferential signal path, symmetry isvery important.

#### Description:
The **LMH6554** is a high-performance, fully differential amplifier designed for exceptional signal fidelity and wide large-signal bandwidth. It operates at a small-signal bandwidth of 2.8GHz and a large-signal bandwidth of 1.8GHz, making it suitable for high-speed applications. The amplifier features a proprietary differential current mode input stage that allows for unity gain operation and maintains performance across a range of gains without sacrificing response flatness or noise performance.

#### Typical Applications:
The LMH6554 is commonly used in:
- **Differential ADC Drivers:** It can drive analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with high linearity and low distortion.
- **Single-Ended to Differential Converters:** Converts single-ended signals to differential outputs, which is essential for reducing noise in high-speed applications.
- **High-Speed Differential Signaling:** Used in communication systems where differential signaling is preferred for noise immunity.
- **IF/RF and Baseband Gain Blocks:** Amplifies intermediate frequency (IF) and radio frequency (RF) signals.
- **SAW Filter Buffer/Driver:** Acts as a buffer for surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters.
- **Automotive Safety Applications:** Suitable for automotive applications requiring high reliability and performance.

This amplifier is particularly effective in applications requiring high bandwidth and low distortion, such as video processing, instrumentation, and data acquisition systems.
