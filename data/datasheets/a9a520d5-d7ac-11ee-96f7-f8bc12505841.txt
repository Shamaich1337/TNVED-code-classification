ROHM designs and manufactures its Products subject to  strict quality control system. However, semiconductor \nproducts can fail or malfunction at a certain rate. Please be sure to implement, at your own responsibilities, adequate \nsafety measures including but not limited to fail-safe desi gn against the physical injury, damage to any property, which \na failure or malfunction of our Products may cause. The following are examples of safety measures: \n[a] Installation of protection circuits or other protective devices to improve system safety \n[b] Installation of redundant circuits to reduce the impact of single or multiple circuit failure  \n3. Our Products are designed and manufactured for use under  standard conditions and not under any special or \nextraordinary environments or conditio ns, as exemplified below. Accordin gly, ROHM shall not be in any way \nresponsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses arising from the use of an y ROHM’s Products under any \nspecial or extraordinary environments or conditions.  If you intend to use our Products under any special or \nextraordinary environments or conditions (as exemplified below), your independent verification and confirmation of product performance, reliability, etc, prior to use, must be necessary: \n[a] Use of our Products in any types of liquid, incl uding water, oils, chemicals, and organic solvents \n[b] Use of our Products outdoors or in places where the Products are exposed to direct sunlight or dust \n[c] Use of our Products in places where the Products ar e exposed to sea wind or corrosive gases, including Cl\n2, \nH2S, NH 3, SO 2, and NO 2 \n[d] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to static electricity or electromagnetic waves \n[e] Use of our Products in proximity to heat-producing components, plastic cords, or other flammable items \n[f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials \n[g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (ev en if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of \nflux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning residue after soldering \n[h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation \n \n4. The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design. \n \n5. Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products. \n 6.  In particular, if a transient load (a  large amount of load applied in a short per iod of time, such as pulse. is applied, \nconfirmation of performance characteristics after on-boar d mounting is strongly recomm ended. Avoid applying power \nexceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading c ondition may negatively affect \nproduct performance and reliability. \n \n7.  De-rate Power Dissipation (Pd) depending on Ambient temper ature (Ta). When used in sealed area, confirm the actual \nambient temperature. \n \n8.  Confirm that operation temperat ure is within the specified range described in the product specification. \n 9.
