Bourns® Multifuse® PPTC Resettable Fuses\n• Users are responsible for independent and adequate evaluation of Bourns® Multifuse® Polymer PTC devices in the user’s \n application, including the PPTC device characteristics stated in the applicable data sheet.\n• Polymer PTC devices must not be allowed to operate beyond their stated maximum ratings. Operation in excess of such  \n maximum ratings could result in damage to the PTC device and possibly lead to electrical arcing and/or fire. Circuits with  \n inductance may generate a voltage above the rated voltage of the polymer PTC device and should be thoroughly evaluated  \n within the user’s application during the PTC selection and qualification process.\n• Polymer PTC devices are intended to protect against adverse effects of temporary overcurrent or overtemperature  \n conditions up to rated limits and are not intended to serve as protective devices where overcurrent or overvoltage conditions  \n are expected to be repetitive or prolonged.\n• In normal operation, polymer PTC devices experience thermal expansion under fault conditions. Thus, a polymer PTC  \n device must be protected against mechanical stress, and must be given adequate clearance within the user ’s application to  \n accommodate such thermal expansion. Rigid potting materials or fixed housings or coverings that do not provide adequate  \n clearance should be thoroughly examined and tested by the user, as they may result in the malfunction of polymer PTC  \n devices if the thermal expansion is inhibited.\n• Exposure to lubricants, silicon-based oils, solvents, gels, electrolytes, acids, and other related or similar materials may  \n adversely affect the performance of polymer PTC devices.\n• Aggressive solvents may adversely affect the performance of polymer PTC devices. Conformal coating, encapsulating,  \n potting, molding, and sealing materials may contain aggressive solvents including but not limited to xylene and toluene,  \n which are known to cause adverse effects on the performance of polymer PTCs. Such aggressive solvents must be  \n thoroughly cured or baked to ensure their complete removal from polymer PTCs to minimize the possible adverse effect  \n on the device.\n• Recommended storage conditions should be followed at all times. Such conditions can be found on the applicable data  \n sheet and on the Multifuse® Polymer PTC Moisture/Reflow Sensitivity Classification (MSL) note:  \n https://www.bourns.com/docs/RoHS-MSL/msl_mf.pdf\nLegal \tDisclaimer \tNotice\nThis legal disclaimer applies to purchasers and users of Bourns® products manufactured by or on behalf of Bourns, Inc. and \nits affiliates (collectively, “Bourns”).\nUnless otherwise expressly indicated in writing, Bourns® products and data sheets relating thereto are subject to change \nwithout notice.  Users should check for and obtain the latest relevant information and verify that such information is current \nand complete before placing orders for Bourns® products.\nThe characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® product set forth in its data sheet are based on laboratory conditions, and \nstatements regarding the suitability of products for certain types of applications are based on Bourns’ knowledge of typical requirements in generic applications.  The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns\n® product in a user application may vary \nfrom the data sheet characteristics and parameters due to (i) the combination of the Bourns® product with other components \nin the user’s application, or (ii) the environment of the user application itself.  The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® \nproduct also can and do vary in different applications and actual performance may vary over time.  Users should always verify the actual performance of the Bourns\n® product in their specific devices and applications, and make their own independent \njudgments regarding the amount of additional test margin to design into their device or application to compensate for  \ndifferences between laboratory and real world conditions.\nUnless Bourns has explicitly designated an individual Bourns® product as meeting the requirements of a particular industry \nstandard (e.g., ISO/TS 16949) or a particular qualification (e.g., UL listed or recognized), Bourns is not responsible for any \nfailure of an individual Bourns® product to meet the requirements of such industry standard or particular qualification.

If Bourns expressly identifies a sub-category of automotive application in the data sheet for its standard products (such as infotainment \nor lighting), such identification means that Bourns has reviewed its standard product and has determined that if such Bourns\n® \nstandard product is considered for potential use in automotive applications, it should only be used in such sub-category of \nautomotive applications.  Any reference to Bourns® standard product in the data sheet as compliant with the AEC-Q standard \nor “automotive grade” does not by itself mean that Bourns has approved such product for use in an automotive application.\nBourns® standard products are not tested to comply with United States Federal Aviation Administration standards generally \nor any other generally equivalent governmental organization standard applicable to products designed or manufactured for \nuse in aircraft or space applications.

#### Description:
The MF-SMDF050 is a Polymer Positive Temperature Coefficient (PPTC) resettable fuse, designed to provide overcurrent protection in electronic circuits. It operates by increasing its resistance significantly when a fault condition occurs, thereby limiting the current flow. Once the fault is removed and the device cools down, it resets automatically, allowing normal operation to resume without the need for replacement.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Power Over Ethernet (PoE)**: Protects Ethernet ports in devices that utilize IEEE 802.3af standards.
- **Automotive Electronic Control Modules**: Safeguards sensitive automotive electronics from overcurrent conditions.
- **Telecom Equipment**: Provides low voltage protection in telecommunications devices, ensuring reliability and safety in communication systems.

This component is particularly useful in applications where space is limited and fast response times are critical for protecting sensitive electronic components from damage due to overcurrent conditions.
