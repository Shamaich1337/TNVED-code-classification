At 1.9 GHz, \nthe amplifier typically provides 14.7 dB gain, +40 dBm \nOIP3, and 1.8 dB Noise Figure while only drawing 85 mA \ncurrent. The device is housed in a leadfree/green/RoHS -\ncompliant industry -standard SOT -89 package.  \n \nThe TQP3M9028 has the benefit of having excellent gain \nflatness across a broad range of frequencies. The low noise \nfigure and high linearity performance allows the device to \nbe used in both receiver and transmitter chains for high \nperformance systems. The amplifier is internally matched \nusing a high performance E -pHEMT process and only \nrequires an external RF choke and bl ocking/bypass \ncapacitors for operation from a single +5V supply. The \ninternal active bias circuit also enables stable operation \nover bias and temperature variations.  \n \nThe TQP3M9028 covers the 50 -4000 MHz frequency band \nand is targeted for wireless infrast ructure or other \napplications requiring high linearity and/or low noise figure.
