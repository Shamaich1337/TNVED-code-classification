### Component Summary: CBTD16210DGG

**Manufacturer:** Nexperia (formerly NXP Semiconductors)

**Description:**
The CBTD16210 is a 20-bit level shifting bus switch designed for high-speed TTL-compatible bus switching. It features a low on-state resistance, allowing for minimal propagation delay when connecting two ports. The device is organized as a dual 10-bit bus switch with separate output-enable (OE) inputs, enabling it to function as either two 10-bit bus switches or one 20-bit bus switch. It is particularly useful for level shifting between 5V inputs and 3.3V outputs.

**Key Specifications:**

  - Supply Voltage (VCC): 4.5V to 5.5V (absolute max: -0.5V to +7.0V)
  - Input Voltage: -0.5V to +7.0V
  - Output Voltage: -0.5V to +5.5V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - DC Output Current (Low State): 128 mA
  - Input Diode Current: -50 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Total Supply Current (Outputs Disabled, VCC = 5.5V): 4.0 µA
  - Quiescent Supply Current: 1.5 mA

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40°C to +85°C

- **Package Type:**
  - Available in 48-Pin Plastic SSOP (SOT370-1) and 48-Pin Plastic TSSOP (SOT362-1)

- **Special Features:**
  - Integrated diode for level shifting
  - TTL compatible control input levels
  - Low on-state resistance (typically 5Ω)

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - Not specified in the provided data, but typically assessed according to JEDEC J-STD-020E standards.

**Typical Applications:**
The CBTD16210 is commonly used in applications requiring level shifting between different voltage domains, such as:
- **Power Management:** Facilitating communication between components operating at different voltage levels.
- **Signal Processing:** Enabling data transfer between devices with incompatible voltage levels.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Used in devices that require interfacing between 5V and 3.3V logic levels, such as microcontrollers and sensors.

This component is ideal for use in automotive, industrial, computing, and consumer applications where reliable and fast data communication is essential.
