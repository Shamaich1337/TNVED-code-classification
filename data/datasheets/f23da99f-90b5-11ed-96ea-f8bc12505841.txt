This patent \npending design differentiates itself from other launch connectors:\n•Design of the connector is self contained, no external mounting screws, adapter sections, spring\nclips, etc. are required for assembly to the circuit board.\n•Center contact pin does not require special orientation to the surface of the circuit board. The cen-\nter contact is mechanically captivated and optimized to maintain proper impedance while with-standing torque and axial force stress.\n•Output coax of the connector at board launch is sized appropriately to match the thickness of the\nhigh frequency board substrate. The output coax section extends well within the connector whilemaintaining constant inner and outer coaxial diameters.\n•Signal side grounding legs of the connector are spaced close enough to keep grounding paths\nshort, but far enough apart to maintain constant impedance in the launch transition area.\n•Signal side grounding legs and GCPW geometry control radiation, no additional shielding is\nrequired to prevent signal cross-talk effects in the transition area. The launch transition is effec-\ntively isolated from adjacent transmission lines in the signal plane.\n•Connector is not locked into position when placed on the circuit board. Intentional ﬂoating design\nallows proper alignment in X, Y and Z, minimizing discontinuities due to manufacturing tolerances.\n•The new distinctive through hole mounting technique allows the use of one connector with varying\ncircuit board thicknesses. The connectors are also available in a traditional straddle mount endlaunch design, which was pioneered by Emerson Network Power Connectivity Solutions over 20years ago.\n•A small amount of PTFE insulation projects from the rear mating plane of the connector, acting as\na seal when soldering the center conductor pin to the trace.  The connector is held against the cir-cuit board edge during the soldering process, compressing the PTFE insulation. This effectivelycreates a barrier between the inner and outer conductors, preventing the bridging of solder.\n•Appropriate sized connectors do not require additional compensation to standard coplanar or\nmicrostrip matched impedance line geometries. Transition can be ﬁne-tuned by pulling the traceback a slight amount from the board edge. \nDesign Features\n \nHigh Frequency SMA End Launch Connectors \n Emerson Network Power • Tel: 800.247.8256 • Fax 507.833.6287 • www.EmersonNetworkPower.com/connectivity \n4ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nImpedance:   50 Ohms\nFrequency Range :  0-26.5 GHz\nVSWR :  1.05+.02F(GHz) maximum at 0-18 GHz, <1.50 typical at 18-26.5 GHz\nWorking Voltage:   170 Vrms maximum at sea level, \n45 Vrms maximum at 70K feet\nDielectric Withstanding Voltage:   500 Vrms minimum at sea level\nCorona Level:   125 Volts at 70K feet \nInsertion Loss:   Dependant upon application\nInsulation Resistance:   1000 Megohms minimum\nContact Resistance:   (milliohms maximum) Initial After Envir onmental\nCenter Contact  . . . . .3.0           4.0\nOuter Conductor. . . . .2.0  Not Applicable\nRF Leakage:   Not Applicable\nRF High Potential Withstanding Voltage : 335 Vrms minimum at 4 and 7 MHz \nMECHANICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nEngagement Design:   MIL-STD-348, Series SMA\nDurability :  500 Cycles minimum\nEngagement/Disengagement Force:   2 inch-pounds maximum\nMating Torque:   7 to 10 inch-pounds\nContact Retention:   6 pounds minimum axial force, 4 in-oz minimum radial \ntorque\nENVIRONMENTAL SPECIFICATIONS\n(Meets or Exceeds the Applicable Paragraph of MIL-PRF-39012)\nTemperature Range :  -65°C to +165°C\nThermal Shock:   MIL-STD-202, Method 107, Condition B - \nExcept 115°C High Temp\nCorrosion :  MIL-STD-202, Method 101, Condition B\nShock:   MIL-STD-202, Method 213, Condition I\nVibration :  MIL-STD-202, Method 204, Condition D\nMoisture Resistance:   MIL-STD-202, Method 106Mating Engagement for SMA Series Thickwall Plug \nCompatable with MIL-STD-348\nAssembly Tool for End Launch Jack Receptacles\nHand tighten to 5 inch \npounds maximum torque\n140-0000-973 \nSpeciﬁcations\n \nHigh Frequency SMA End Launch Connectors \n  \nEmerson Network Power • Tel: 800.247.8256 • Fax 507.833.6287 • www.EmersonNetworkPower.com/connectivity \n5Jack Receptacle – PC Mount, Round Body\nCoupling proof \ntorque 8 inch-pounds maximum without support wrench\nFREQ RANGE GOLD PLATED HIGH FREQUENCY SUBSTRATE THICKNESS “A” “B” “C”\n0-26.5 GHz142-0761-801 .008 (0.20) - .014 (0.36) .010 (0.25) .050 (1.27) .096 (2.44)\n142-0761-821 .014 (0.36) - .020 (0.51) .015 (0.38) .067 (1.70) .113 (2.87)\nJack Receptacle – PC Mount, Square Body\nCoupling proof \ntorque 8 inch-pounds maximum without support wrench\nFREQ RANGE GOLD PLATED HIGH FREQUENCY SUBSTRATE THICKNESS “A” “B” “C”\n0-26.5 GHz142-0761-811 .008 (0.20) - .014 (0.36) .010 (0.25) .050 (1.27) .096 (2.44)\n142-0761-831 .014 (0.36) - .020 (0.51) .015 (0.38) .067 (1.70) .113 (2.87)\nJack Receptacle – PC Mount, Round Body with Thick Legs\nFREQ RANGE GOLD PLATED HIGH FREQUENCY SUBSTRATE THICKNESS “A” “B” “C”\n0-26.5 GHz142-0761-881 .008 (0.20) - .014 (0.36) .010 (0.25) .050 (1.27) .096 (2.44)\n142-0771-821 .014 (0.36) - .020 (0.51) .015 (0.38) .067 (1.70) .113 (2.87)\n \nPart Data\n \nHigh Frequency SMA End Launch Connectors \n Emerson Network Power • Tel: 800.247.8256 • Fax 507.833.6287 • www.EmersonNetworkPower.com/connectivity \n6Jack Receptacle – Edge Mount for .062 Board, Round Body\nFREQ RANGE GOLD PLATED HIGH FREQUENCY SUBSTRATE THICKNESS “A” “B” “C”\n0-26.5 GHz142-0761-841 .008 (0.20) - .014 (0.36) .010 (0.25) .050 (1.27) .032 (0.81)\n142-0761-861 .014 (0.36) - .020 (0.51) .015 (0.38) .067 (1.70) .040 (1.02)Coupling proof \ntorque 8 inch-pounds maximum without support wrench\nJack Receptacle – Edge Mount for .062 Board, Square Body\nCoupling proof torque 8 inch-pounds maximum without support wrench\nFREQ RANGE GOLD PLATED HIGH FREQUENCY SUBSTRATE THICKNESS “A” “B” “C”\n0-26.5 GHz142-0761-851 .008 (0.20) - .014 (0.36) .010 (0.25) .050 (1.27) .032 (0.81)\n142-0761-871 .014 (0.36) - .020 (0.51) .015 (0.38) .067 (1.70) .040 (1.02)\nJack Receptacle – Edge Mount for .062 Board, Round Body \nwith Thick Legs\nFREQ RANGE GOLD PLATED HIGH FREQUENCY SUBSTRATE THICKNESS “A” “B”\n0-26.5 GHz142-0761-891 .008 (0.20) - .014 (0.36) .010 (0.25) .050 (1.27)\n142-0771-831 .014 (0.36) - .020 (0.51) .015 (0.38) .067 (1.70)\n \nPart Data\n \nHigh Frequency SMA End Launch Connectors \n  \nEmerson Network Power • Tel: 800.247.8256 • Fax 507.833.6287 • www.EmersonNetworkPower.com/connectivity \n7High frequency end launch performance is dependent upon proper mounting. The following factors must be controlled \nfor optimum performance:\n      a.  The connector should ﬁt tightly against the circuit board edge, avoid gaps. \n      b.  The center contact pin must lie parallel and ﬂat against the circuit board, avoid gaps.       c.  The contact pin should be centered on the circuit board signal trace.       d.  Use a minimal amount of solder between the contact pin and signal trace. Do not allow excess solder to build up \n      or ﬂow down the trace. \n      e.  Clean all excess ﬂux and other residue from the launch area, especially between the trace and ground\nThe basic steps required to mount the end launch connector to the circuit board are as follows:\n1.    Fixture 140-0000-973 should be used as an aid during manual soldering.\nThe ﬁxture protects the connector from damage during clamping and alsomaintains the proper location of the connector’s insulator and contact. Touse the ﬁxture, thread the coupling nut on the mating end of the connectorand hand tighten. This mounting assembly can now be held in a vice orsimilar clamping device, as shown in Figure 1. \n2.   Position connector on the circuit board, making sure the contact pin is\naligned with the center of the signal trace as shown in Figure 2. Make surethat the connector legs and contact pin are held ﬂush against the top of thecircuit board, keeping the axis of the connector parallel to the plane of thecircuit board, as shown in Figure 3. \n3.     A small amount of Teﬂon® insulation projects from rear mating plane of the\nconnector, which acts as a seal when soldering the center conductor pin tothe trace. Clamp the connector tightly against the edge of the board. Thisaction compresses the insulator seal against the board edge. Thiseffectively creates a barrier between the inner and outer conductors,preventing the bridging of solder. \n4.  While ensuring the connector is held in the correct position, solder the\nground legs and/or ground posts to the top and bottom of the board prior tobonding the center pin to the trace.\n5.   Once the connector body is properly grounded to the board, the center\ncontact pin can be bonded to the trace by using a minimal amount ofsolder as shown in Figure 4. It is important that solder ﬂows along thelength of the exposed pin, creating a good electrical and mechanicalconnection. Remove any excess solder that is not required for a solid joint. \n6.     Clean all ﬂux and other residues from the trace area between the signal\nside ground legs, as any ﬂux present between the signal trace and groundwill affect performance. The completed mounting assembly should looksimilar to the one shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 4\nFigure 5PC MOUNTING INSTRUCTIONS\nFigure 1\nFigure 2\nFigure 3 \nMounting Instructions\n \nHigh Frequency SMA End Launch Connectors \n Emerson Network Power • Tel: 800.247.8256 • Fax 507.833.6287 • www.EmersonNetworkPower.com/connectivity \n8Mounting Footprint Info\n1.

For optimum high frequency circuit board performance, use the following fabrication guidelines:\nA. Maintain a solid ground plane below the high frequency substrate layer.\nB.

In order to achievelow loss, the transition design between the launch connector and the printed circuit board requires theoptimization of both mechanical and electrical features.  The mechanical design must physically matchthe electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution as close as possible in order to keep the discontinuity reactancessmall, as shown in Figure 1.  The electrical design must match the impedances and other interfacediscontinuity reactances over the entire bandwidth.\nMinimizing the discontinuity reactances is desired rather than just compensating for them.\nCompensation can limit the usable frequency range of the connector, if the reactances are too large.The connector design incorporates an internal matched impedance transition from a large input coaxialconnector interface, such as SMA, to a small coaxial output matched to the size of the PC board highfrequency substrate.  The internal transition between the input and output consists of graduatedcoaxial diametrical step sections, each optimized in size with inductive offsets to reduce the capacitivediscontinuities created by the change in coaxial diameters.  As shown in Figure 1, using multiple coaxialstep sections to match the size of the circuit board reduces the overall effect of the discontinuities,thereby increasing the usable frequency range of the launch connector.\nThe transition between the launch and the PC board is designed for attachment to grounded coplanar\nwaveguide (GCPW) transmission lines.  The signal output pin of the launcher is optimized in both lengthand diameter to match the corresponding GCPW line. The geometrical size of the signal side groundleg pairs is optimized in height, length and center to center spacing to match the output pin and GCPWline. The combination of optimal signal pin and ground leg design minimizes the attachmentdiscontinuity reactance.\nFigure 1 - Simulated Electric Field Distributions within the Dielectric Regions at 18 GHz \nWhite Paper\n \nHigh Frequency SMA End Launch Connectors \n Emerson Network Power • Tel: 800.247.8256 • Fax 507.833.6287 • www.EmersonNetworkPower.com/connectivity \n10Easily connected to GPCW transmission lines with \nreproducible results\nA coplanar waveguide transmission line is formed by a planar conductor separated by a pair of ground\nplanes, all on the same plane, atop of a high frequency dielectric medium. A variant is formed when aground plane is provided on the opposite side of the dielectric which is called grounded coplanarwaveguide (GCPW).  Although GCPW is the preferred transmission line structure on the circuit board forthis connector, other lines such as microstrip can be used with good results.\nAt microwave frequencies, the coplanar waveguide can be equal to or better than the microstrip when\nloss and dispersion are used as a basis for comparison. Minimum loss for a given coplanar waveguideoccurs at about 60 Ohms whereas the minimum loss for microstrip occurs at about 25 Ohms.  A full waveanalysis which includes space wave and surface wave radiation shows that coplanar waveguidediscontinuities radiate much less energy than microstrip discontinuities.\nThe GCPW transmission line is fabricated on a high frequency circuit board substrate.  Dielectric constant\ncontrol, low dissipation factor and controlled thicknesses differentiate these high frequency circuit boardmaterials from those typically used in the high volume printed circuit board world like FR4 and BT/epoxy.For higher frequencies, dielectric loss becomes an important contributor to the total loss. This isimportant because, as the frequency increases, the thickness of the material must decrease in order toavoid generating transverse modes on the transmission lines.\nThe high frequency material’s low loss performance extends the useful range of these materials well\nabove 20 GHz.  However, very thin dielectric layers as small as .008” are not mechanically stable enoughto support the connector and associated circuitry. Therefore, hybrid circuit board constructionsconsisting of high frequency laminates and epoxy/glass substrates have become an increasingly utilizedalternative to lower overall circuit board costs. The DC, control and digital signal paths are designed ontothe lower cost epoxy/glass FR4 layer and the microwave signals are carried on the high frequency toplayer as shown in Figures  1A and 1B.\nTypical HF/Digital Multilayer Hybrid Construction (GCPW Figure 1A,  microstrip Figure 1B)\nFigure 1A\nFigure 1B \nWhite Paper\n \nHigh Frequency SMA End Launch Connectors \n  \nEmerson Network Power • Tel: 800.247.8256 • Fax 507.833.6287 • www.EmersonNetworkPower.com/connectivity \n11As can be seen in the cut away portion of Figure 1, the connector’s center conductor pin is directly\nattached in-line with the GCPW signal trace.  The body of the connector is always attached to the signalside ground.  The design of the center conductor pin is a compromise between ease of assembly andminimal discontinuity reactance.  The diameter of the pin is matched approximately to the thickness of theGCPW structure.  Scaling down the pin diameter matches the electromagnetic ﬁeld distributions with theGCPW line in order to keep the discontinuity reactance small.\nThe output coax of the connector at the transition area is sized appropriately to match the thickness of the\nhigh frequency board substrate. The output coax section extends well within the connector by means ofconstant diameters, avoiding any abrupt diametrical changes at the circuit board edge which can createlarge discontinuities.\nFigure 1 - End Launch Connector Shown Attached to the GCPW Transmission Line \nWhite Paper\nwww.EmersonNetworkPower.com/connectivity\n ESCON is a trademark of IBM.\nRFC06Emerson Network Power Connectivity Solutions isaglobal manufacturer of a broad line of connectivity products and services \nsupporting wireline and wireless communications, data networking, test and measurement, military, medical, broadcast and industrial applications.
