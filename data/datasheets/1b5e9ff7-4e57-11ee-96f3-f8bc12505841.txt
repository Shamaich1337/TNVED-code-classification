The device is offered \nin a small footprint surface-mount package that allows easy \nimplementation in customer applications.\nThe ACS710 consists of a precision linear Hall sensor integrated \ncircuit with a copper conduction path located near the surface \nof the silicon die. Applied current flows through the copper \nconduction path, and the analog output voltage from the Hall \nsensor linearly tracks the magnetic field generated by the \napplied current. The accuracy of the ACS710 is maximized \nwith this patented packaging configuration because the Hall \nelement is situated in extremely close proximity to the current \nto be measured.\nHigh-level immunity to current conductor dV/dt and stray \nelectric fields, offered by Allegro proprietary integrated shield \ntechnology, results in low ripple on the output and low offset \ndrift in high-side, high-voltage applications.\nThe voltage on the Overcurrent Input (VOC pin) allows \ncustomers to define an overcurrent fault threshold for the device. \nWhen the current flowing through the copper conduction path \n(between the IP+ and IP– pins) exceeds this threshold, the open \ndrain Overcurrent Fault pin will transition to a logic low state. \nFactory programming of the linear Hall sensor inside of the \nACS710 results in exceptional accuracy in both analog and \ndigital output signals.\nThe internal resistance of the copper path used for current \nsensing is typically 1 mΩ, for low power loss. Also, the current \nconduction path is electrically isolated from the low-voltage \nACS710-DS, Rev. 18\nMCO-0000196FEATURES AND BENEFITS\n▪ Industry-leading noise performance with greatly improved \nbandwidth through proprietary amplifier and filter design \ntechniques\n▪ Small footprint package suitable for space-constrained \napplications\n▪ 1 mΩ primary conductor resistance for low power loss\n▪ High isolation voltage, suitable for line-powered \napplications\n▪ User-adjustable Overcurrent Fault level\n▪ Overcurrent Fault signal typically responds to an \novercurrent condition in < 2 μs\n▪ Integrated shield virtually eliminates capacitive coupling \nfrom current conductor to die due to high dV/dt voltage \ntransients\n▪ Filter pin capacitor improves resolution in low bandwidth \napplications\n▪ 3 to 5.5 V single supply operation\n▪ Factory-trimmed sensitivity and quiescent output voltage\n▪ Chopper stabilization results in extremely stable quiescent \noutput voltage\n▪ Ratiometric output from supply voltage120 kHz Bandwidth, High-Voltage Isolation  \nCurrent Sensor with Integrated Overcurrent Detection\nContinued on the next page…PACKAGE : 16-Pin SOIC Hall-Effect IC \nPackage (suffix LA)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8IP+\nIP+\nIP+\nIP+\nIP–\nIP–\nIP–\nIP–16\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9FAULT_EN\nVOC\nVCC\nFAULT\nVIOUT\nFILTER\nVZCR\nGNDACS710\n0.1 µFCOC\nCF\n1 nFVIOUTFault_ENVCC\nRH\nRPURL\nIPB\nARH, RLSets resistor divider reference for VOC\nCF Noise and bandwidth limiting filter capacitor\nCOC Fault delay setting capacitor, 22 nF maximum\nA Use of capacitor required\nBUse of resistor optional, 330 kΩ recommended. \nIf used, resistor must be connected between  \n¯F¯  ¯A  ¯U ¯¯L¯  ¯T¯     pin and VCC.\nTypical Application CircuitNot to scaleCB Certificate Number:\nUS-23711-A2-ULACS710\nJuly 18, 2023\n120 kHz Bandwidth, High-Voltage Isolation  \nCurrent Sensor with Integrated Overcurrent DetectionACS7102\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comsensor inputs and outputs.

The device contains ratiometry circuits that accurately alter the 0 A Output Voltage and \nSensitivity level of the device in proportion to the applied VCC level. However, as a result of minor nonlinearities in the ratiometry circuit, additional output \nerror will result when VCC varies from the VCC level at which the device was programmed. Customers that plan to operate the device at a VCC level other \nthan the VCC level at which the device was programmed should contact their local Allegro sales representative regarding expected device accuracy levels \nunder these bias conditions.\n[2] RF(INT) forms an RC circuit via the FILTER pin.\n[3] This parameter can drift by as much as 0.8% over the lifetime of this product.\n[4] This parameter can drift by as much as 1% over the lifetime of this product.\n[5] See page 8 on how to set overcurrent fault switch point.\n[6] Switch point can be lower at the expense of switch point accuracy.\n[7] This error specification does not include the effect of noise. See the INCOMP  specification in order to factor in the additional influence of noise on the \nfault switch point.\n[8] Fault Enable Delay is designed to avoid false tripping of an Overcurrent (OC) fault at power-up. A 15 µs (typical) delay will always be needed, every \ntime FAULT_EN is raised from low to high, before the device is ready for responding to any overcurrent event.\n[9] During power-up, this delay is 15 µs in order to avoid false tripping of an Overcurrent (OC) fault.\n120 kHz Bandwidth, High-Voltage Isolation  \nCurrent Sensor with Integrated Overcurrent DetectionACS7108\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comPERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS : TA Range K, valid at TA = –\u200a40°C to 125°C, VCC = 5 V, unless otherwise specified\nCharacteristic Symbol  Test Conditions  Min.

The \nreason for this is that in many applications, such as motor control, the start-up current of the motor is approximately three times higher than the \nrunning current.\n[2] Vpk-pk noise (6 sigma noise) is equal to 6 × VNOISE(rms) . Lower noise levels than this can be achieved by using Cf for applications requiring narrower \nbandwidth.

Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comOvercurrent Fault Operation\nThe primary concern with high-speed fault detection is that noise \nmay cause false tripping. Various applications have or need to \nbe able to ignore certain faults that are due to switching noise or \nother parasitic phenomena, which are application-dependant. The \nproblem with simply trying to filter out this noise in the main \nsignal path is that in high-speed applications, with asymmetric \nnoise, the act of filtering introduces an error into the measure -\nment. To get around this issue, and allow the user to prevent the \nfault signal from being latched by noise, a circuit was designed to \nslew the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin voltage based on the value of the capacitor \nfrom that pin to ground. Once the voltage on the pin falls below \n2 V , as established by an internal reference, the fault output is \nlatched and pulled to ground quickly with an internal N-channel \nMOSFET.\nFault Walkthrough\nThe following walkthrough references various sections and \nattributes in the figure below. This figure shows different \nfault set/reset scenarios and how they relate to the voltages on \nthe ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin, FAULT_EN pin, and the internal Overcurrent \n(OC) Fault node, which is invisible to the customer.\n1. Because the device is enabled (FAULT_EN is high for a \nminimum period of time, the Fault Enable Delay, tFED , 15 µs \ntypical) and there is an OC fault condition, the device ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   \npin starts discharging.\n2. When the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin voltage reaches approximately 2 V , the \nfault is latched, and an internal NMOS device pulls the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   \npin voltage to approximately 0 V . The rate at which the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   \npin slews downward (see [4] in the figure) is dependent on the \nexternal capacitor, COC, on the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin.\n3. When the FAULT_EN pin is brought low, the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   \npin starts resetting if no OC fault condition exists, and if \nFAULT_EN is low for a time period greater than tOCH . The internal NMOS pull-down turns off and an internal PMOS pull-\nup turns on (see [7] if the OC fault condition still exists).\n4. The slope, and thus the delay to latch the fault is controlled by \nthe capacitor, COC, placed on the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin to ground. Dur -\ning this portion of the fault (when the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin is between \nVCC and 2 V), there is a 3 mA constant current sink, which \ndischarges COC. The length of the fault delay, t, is equal to :\n COC     ( VCC – 2 V )\n3 mAt=\n (1)\n where VCC is the device power supply voltage in volts, t is in \nseconds and COC is in Farads. This formula is valid for RPU \nequal to or greater than 330 kΩ. For lower-value resistors, \nthe current flowing through the RPU resistor during a fault \nevent, IPU , will be larger. Therefore, the current discharging \nthe capacitor would be 3 mA – IPU and equation 1 may not be \nvalid.\n5. The ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin did not reach the 2 V latch point before the \nOC fault condition cleared. Because of this, the fixed 3 mA \ncurrent sink turns off, and the internal PMOS pull-up turns on \nto recharge COC through the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin.\n6. This curve shows VCC charging external capacitor COC \nthrough the internal PMOS pull-up. The slope is determined \nby COC.\n7. When the FAULT_EN pin is brought low, if the fault condition \nstill exists, the latched ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin will be pulled low by the \ninternal 3mA current source. When fault condition is removed \nthen the Fault pin charges as shown in step 6.\n8. At this point there is a fault condition, and the part is enabled \nbefore the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin can charge to VCC. This shortens the \nuser-set delay, so the fault is latched earlier. The new delay \ntime can be calculated by equation 1, after substituting the \nvoltage seen on the ¯F¯  ¯A¯  ¯U¯  ¯L¯  ¯T¯   pin for VCC.FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION  (Latching Versions)\nVCC\n2 V\n0 V\nTimetFED\nFAULT\n(Output)\nFAULT_EN\n(Input)\nOC Fault\nCondition\n(Active High)2\n366\n681 1 1\n4\n2\n74\n244\n5\n120 kHz Bandwidth, High-Voltage Isolation  \nCurrent Sensor with Integrated Overcurrent DetectionACS71018\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comOvercurrent Fault Operation\nThe primary concern with high-speed fault detection is that noise \nmay cause false tripping.

This offset reduction technique is based on \na signal modulation-demodulation process.

The change in sensor output in response to a \n1 A change through the primary conductor. The sensitivity is the \nproduct of the magnetic circuit sensitivity (G / A) and the linear \nIC amplifier gain (mV/G). The linear IC amplifier gain is pro -\ngrammed at the factory to optimize the sensitivity (mV/A) for the \nfull-scale current of the device.\nNoise (VNOISE ). The product of the linear IC amplifier gain \n(mV/G) and the noise floor for the Allegro Hall-effect linear \nIC. The noise floor is derived from the thermal and shot noise \nobserved in Hall elements. Dividing the noise (mV) by the sensi -\ntivity (mV/A) provides the smallest current that the device is able \nto resolve.   \nLinearity (ELIN). The degree to which the voltage output from \nthe sensor varies in direct proportion to the primary current \nthrough its full-scale amplitude. Nonlinearity in the output can be \nattributed to the saturation of the flux concentrator approaching \nthe full-scale current. The following equation is used to derive the \nlinearity:  \nwhere VIOUT_full-scale amperes  = the output voltage (V) when the \nsensed current approximates full-scale ±IP .\nSymmetry (ESYM).  The degree to which the absolute voltage \noutput from the sensor varies in proportion to either a positive \nor negative full-scale primary current. The following formula is \nused to derive symmetry:\nQuiescent output voltage (VIOUT(Q) ). The output of the sensor \nwhen the primary current is zero. For a unipolar supply voltage, \nit nominally remains at 0.5 × VCC. For example, in the case of a \nbidirectional output device, VCC = 5 V translates into VIOUT(Q)  = \n2.5 V . Variation in VIOUT(Q) can be attributed to the resolution of \nthe Allegro linear IC quiescent voltage trim and thermal drift.\nElectrical offset voltage (VOE). The deviation of the device out -\nput from its ideal quiescent voltage due to nonmagnetic causes. \nTo convert this voltage to amperes, divide by the device sensitiv -\nity, Sens. \nAccuracy (ETOT). The accuracy represents the maximum devia -\ntion of the actual output from its ideal value. This is also known \nas the total output error.  The accuracy is illustrated graphically in \nthe output voltage versus current chart at right. Note that error is \ndirectly measured during final test at Allegro.Accuracy is divided into four areas:\n•\t0 A at 25°C.
