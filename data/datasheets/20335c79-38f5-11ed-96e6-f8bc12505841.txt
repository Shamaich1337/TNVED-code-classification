This 2-channel non-inverting translator uses two separate \nconfigurable power-supply rails. The A port is designed to track V CCA. VCCA accepts any supply \nvoltage from 1.2V to 3.6V. The B port is designed to track V CCB. VCCB accepts any supply voltage \nfrom 1.65V to 5.5V. This allows for universal low-voltage bidirectional translation between any \nof the 1.2V, 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V, and 5V voltage nodes. Both I/O ports are auto-sensing; thus, \nno direction pin is required, making it ideal for data transfer between low-voltage ASICs/PLDs \nand higher voltage systems. \nThe UM3302 operates at a guaranteed data rate of 20Mbps over the entire specified operating \nvoltage range. Within specific voltage domains, higher data rates are up to 100Mbps. \nWhen the output-enable (OE) input is low, all outputs are placed in the high-impedance state. The \nUM3302 is designed so that the OE input circuit is designed to track V CCA. \nTo ensure the high-impedance state during power up or power down, OE should be tied to GND \nthrough a pull down resistor; the minimum value of the resistor is determined by the \ncurrent-sourcing capability of the driver. \nThe UM3302H is a dual channel level translator available in 1.90mm×0.90mm CSP8 bump \npackage while the UM3302M8 is available in MSOP8 package. \n \nApplications  \n Features  \n \n\uf06c Low-Voltage ASIC Level Translation \n\uf06c Cell-Phone Cradles \n\uf06c Portable POS Systems \n\uf06c Portable Communication Devices \n\uf06c Low-Cost Serial Interfaces \n\uf06c Cell-Phones \n\uf06c GPS \n\uf06c Telecommunications Equipment  \uf06c 1.2V to 3.6V on A Port and 1.65V to 5.5V \non B Port (V CCA≤VCCB) \n\uf06c VCC Isolation Feature – If Either V CC  \nInput is at GND, All Outputs are in the \nHigh-Impedance State \n\uf06c OE Input Circuit Referenced to V CCA \n\uf06c Low Power Consumption \n\uf06c Latch-Up Performance Exceeds 100mA  \n\uf06c ±15kV ESD Protection on B Ports \n \nPin Configurations                   Top View \n \n(Top View) \n  \n \n \nM: Month Code \nUM3302H \nCSP8 1.90×0.90  \n                                                                       \n________________________________________________________________________ \nhttp://www.union-ic.com Rev.10 May.2020                                    2/13 \nUM3302  \n \nBall Mapping for UM3302H \n \n   Transparent Top View  \n \nPin Description \n \nPin No Pin Name  Function UM3302H UM3302M8 \nA1 1 B2 Input/Output B.

allow data transfer in \na multi-voltage system. Externally applied voltages, V CCA and V CCB set the logic levels on either \nside of device. A low voltage signal present on V CCA side of the device appears as a high voltage \nlogic signal on the V CCB side of the device, and vice-versa. \n \nBlock Diagram \n \nThe UM3302 (block diagram see Figure 1) does not require a direction-control signal to control \nthe direction of data flow from A to B or from B to A. In a dc state, the output drivers of the \nUM3302 can maintain a high or low, but are designed to be weak, so that they can be overdriven \nby an external driver when data on the bus starts flowing to the opposite direction. \nThe output one shot detects rising or falling edges on the A or B ports. During a rising edge, the \none shot turns on the PMOS transistors (T1, T3) for a short duration, which speeds up the \nlow-to-high transition. Similarly, during a falling edge, the one shot turns on the NMOS \ntransistors (T2, T4) for a short duration, which speeds up the high-to-low transition.  \n \n \n \nFigure 1 Block Diagram of UM3302 I/O Cell \n \n                                                                       \n________________________________________________________________________ \nhttp://www.union-ic.com Rev.10 May.2020                                    9/13 \nUM3302  \nInput Driver Requirements \n \nTypical I IN vs. V IN characteristics of the UM3302 are shown in Figure 2. For proper operation, the \ndevice driving the data I/Os of the UM3302 must have drive strength of at least ±2mA. \n \n \nA: VT is the input threshold voltage of the UM3302 (typical V CCI/2). \nB: VD is the supply voltage of the external driver. \n \nFigure 2 Typical I IN vs. VIN Curve \n \nPower Up \n \nDuring operation, ensure that V CCA≤VCCB at all times. During power-up sequencing, V CCA≥VCCB \ndoes not damage the device, so any power supply can be ramped up first. The UM3302 has \ncircuitry that disables all output ports when either V CC is switched off (V CCA/B=0 V). \n \nEnable and Disable \n \nThe UM3302 has an OE input that is used to disable the device by setting OE=low, which places \nall I/Os in the high-impedance (Hi-Z) state. The disable time (t dis) indicates the delay between \nwhen OE goes low and when the outputs actually get disabled (Hi-Z). The enable time (t en) \nindicates the amount of time the user must allow for the one-shot circuitry to become operational \nafter OE is taken high. \n \nPull-up or Pull-down Resistors on I/O Lines \n \nThe UM3302 is designed to drive capacitive loads of up to 50pF. The output drivers of the \nUM3302H have low dc drive strength. If pull-up or pull-down resistors are connected externally \nto the data I/Os, their values must be kept higher than 50kΩ to ensure that they do not contend \nwith the output drivers of the UM3302. \nFor the same reason, the UM3302 should not be used in applications such as I2C or 1-Wire where \nan open-drain driver is connected on the bidirectional data I/O.  \n \n                                                                       \n________________________________________________________________________ \nhttp://www.union-ic.com Rev.10 May.2020                                    10/13 \nUM3302  \nTypical Operating Circuit \n \nVCCAVCCB\nOE\nA1\nA2B1\nB2\nGNDData\nData\nGNDData\nData\nGND1.8-V\nSystem\nController3.3-V\nSystem1.8V\n0.1μF 0.1μF3.3V\n \n \nFigure 3 Typical Operating Circuit \n \nTest Circuits \n \n15pF 1MΩFrom Output \nUnder Test\nLOAD CIRCUIT FOR MAX DATA RATE ,\nPULSE DURATION PROPAGATION\nDELAY OUTPUT RISE AND FALL TIME\nMEASUREMENT15pF 50kΩ50kΩS12×VCCO\nOpen\nFrom Output \nUnder Test\nLOAD CIRCUIT FOR\nENABLE /DISABLE\nTIME MEASUREMENTTEST S1\ntPZL/tPLZ\ntPHZ/tPZH2×VCCO\nOpen\nVCCI/2 VCCI/2VCCI\n0 V\n0.9×VCCO\n0.1×VCCOVCCO/2 VCCO/2VOH\nVOLtPLH tPHLInput\nOutput\ntr tr\nVOLTAGE WAVEFORMS \nPROPAGATION DELAY TIMEStw\nVCCI\n0 VInput VCCI/2 VCCI/2\nVOLTAGE WAVEFORMS \nPULSE DURATION\nA.

The device operates without the need for a direction control signal, making it suitable for interfacing low-voltage ASICs/PLDs with higher voltage systems. 

**Typical Applications:**
- Low-voltage ASIC level translation
- Cell-phone cradles
- Portable POS systems
- Portable communication devices
- Low-cost serial interfaces
- Telecommunications equipment
- GPS devices

The UM3302H is particularly useful in applications where data needs to be transferred between devices operating at different voltage levels, ensuring compatibility and reliable communication in mixed-voltage environments.
