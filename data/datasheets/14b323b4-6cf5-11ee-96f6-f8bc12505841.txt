Each VR offers \na completely programmable value of resistance between the  A terminal and the wiper or the B terminal and the wiper. The fixed A-to-B terminal resistance of 20 kΩ, 50 kΩ, or 200 kΩ has a 1% channel-to-channel matching tolerance. The nominal temperature coefficient of both parts is 30 parts per million/ \ndegrees centigrade (ppm/°C). Another key feature is that the \nparts can operate up to +15 V or ±5 V . \nWiper position programming defaults to midscale at system \npower-on. When powered, the VR wiper position is programmed by an I\n2C-compatible, 2-wire serial data interface. The AD5280/ \nAD5282 feature sleep mode programmability. This allows any level of preset in power-up and is an alternative to a costly \nEEPROM solution. Both parts have additional programmable logic outputs that enable users to drive digital loads, logic gates, \nLED drivers, and analog switches in their system. \n1 Assert shutdown and program the device during power-up, then deassert \nthe shutdown to achieve the desired preset level. \n2 The terms digital potentiometer, VR, and RDAC are used interchangeably. The AD5280/AD5282 are available in thin, surface-mounted 14-lead TSSOP and 16-lead TSSOP . All parts are guaranteed to operate over the extended industrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C. For 3-wire SPI-compatible interface applica-tions, see the AD5260/ AD5262 product information on \nwww.analog.com . \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAMS \nA WB O1 O2\nRDAC REGISTER OUTPUT REGISTER\nSERIAL INPUT REGISTER\nAD5280SHDN\nVDD\nVSS\nSDASCL\nGND\nAD0 AD1ADDRESS\nCODE PWR ON\nRESETVL\n8\n02929-070\n \nFigure 1.

R-DNL measures the relative step change from ideal between successive tap positions. Parts are guaranteed monotonic.  \n3 VAB = V DD, wiper (V W) = no connect. \n4 INL and DNL are measured at V W with the RDAC configured as a potentiometer divider similar to a voltage output DAC. V A = V DD and V B = 0 V. DNL specification limits \nof ±1 LSB maximum are guaranteed mono tonic operating conditions. \n5 Resistor Terminal A, Resistor  Terminal B, and Wiper Terminal W have no limitations on polarity with respect to each other. \n6 Guaranteed by design and not subject to production test. \n7 PDISS is calculated from (I DD × V DD). CMOS logic level inputs result  in minimum power dissipation. \n8 Bandwidth, noise, and settling time are dependent on the terminal resistance value chosen. The lowest R value results in the f astest settling time and highest \nbandwidth. The highest R value results in  the minimum overall power consumption. \n9 All dynamic characteristics use V DD = 5 V. \n10 See timing diagram (F igure 3) for location  of measured values. \n11 Standard I2C mode operation is guaranteed by design. \n \nt1t2 t3\nt8t8\nt9t9 t6\nt4 t7 t5t2\nt10\nPS SSCL\nSDA\nP  \nFigure 3.

C | Page 14 of 28 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD5280/AD5282 are single-channel and dual-channel, \n256-position, digitally controlled variable resistors (VRs). T o program the VR settings, see the Digital Interface  section. Both \nparts have an internal power-on preset that places the wiper at \nmidscale during power-on, which simplifies the fault condition \nrecovery at power-up. Operation of the power-on preset function \nalso depends on the state of the V\nL pin. \nD7\nD6D5D4D3D2D1D0\nRDAC\nLATCH\nAND\nDECODERR\nS\nRSRSAX\nWX\nRS\nBXSHDN\n0xFF\n0x01 SWBSWA\n0x00\n5 02929-04()\n \nFigure 44. AD5280/AD5282 Equivalent RDAC Circuit \nRHEOSTAT OPERATION \nThe nominal resistance of the RDAC between Terminal A and \nTerminal B is available in 20 kΩ, 50 kΩ, and 200 kΩ. The final \ntwo or three digits of the part number determine the nominal resistance value, for example, 20 kΩ = 20, 50 kΩ = 50, and  200 kΩ = 200. The nominal resistance (R\nAB) of the VR has  \n256 contact points accessed by the wiper terminal, plus the B \nterminal contact. The eight-bit data in the RDAC latch is \ndecoded to select one of the 256 possible settings. Assuming that a 20 kΩ part is used, the wiper’s first connection starts at the B terminal for data 0x00. Because there is a 60 Ω wiper contact resistance, such a connection yields a minimum of 60 Ω resistance between Terminal W and Terminal B.  \nThe second connection is the first tap point that corresponds to \n138 Ω (R\nWB = R AB/256 + R W = 78 Ω + 60 Ω) for data 0x01. The \nthird connection is the next tap point representing 216 Ω (78 × \n2 + 60) for data 0x02, and so on. Each LSB data value increase moves the wiper up the resistor ladder until the last tap point is reached at 19,982 Ω (R\nAB – 1 LSB + R W). Figure 46  shows a \nsimplified diagram of the equivalent RDAC circuit where the last resistor string is not accessed; therefore, there is 1 LSB less of the nominal resistance at full scale in addition to the wiper \nresistance. The general equation determining the digitally programmed output resistance between W and B is \nWAB WB R RDD R + × =256\n() (1) \nwhere: \nD is the decimal equivalent of the binary code loaded in the 8-\nbit RDAC register. \nRAB is the nominal end-to-end resistance. \nRW is the wiper resistance contributed by the on resistance of \nthe internal switch. \nNote that in the zero-scale condition, a finite wiper resistance \nof 60 Ω is present. Care should be taken to limit the current \nflow between W and B in this state to a maximum pulse current of no more than 20 mA. Otherw ise, degradation or possible \ndestruction of the internal switch contact can occur. \nAs in the mechanical potentiometer, the resistance of the RDAC \nbetween Wiper W and Terminal A also produces a digitally \ncontrolled complementary resistance, R\nWA. When these terminals \nare used, the B terminal can be opened. Setting the resistance value for R\nWA starts at a maximum value of resistance and \ndecreases as the data loaded in the latch increases in value. The general equation for this operation is \nWAB WA R RDD R + ×−=256256 (2) \nThe typi\ncal distribution of the nominal resistance, R AB, from \nchannel to channel matches within ±1%. Device-to-device matching is process lot dependent, and it is possible to have a ±30% variation. Because the resistance element is processed in \nthin film technology, the change in R\nAB with temperature is very \nsmall (30 ppm/°C). \nPOTENTIOMETER OPERATION \nThe digital potentiometer easily generates a voltage divider at wiper to B and wiper to A to be proportional to the input voltage \nat A to B. Unlike the polarity of V\nDD – V SS, which must be \npositive, voltage across A to B, W to A, and W to B can be at \neither polarity, provided that V SS is powered by a negative supply. \nIf the effect of the wiper resistance for approximation is ignored, \nconnecting the A terminal to 5 V and the B terminal to ground \nproduces an output voltage at the wiper to B starting at 0 V up \nto 1 LSB less than 5 V . Each LSB of voltage is equal to the voltage applied across A to B divided by the 256 positions of the potentiometer divider. Because the AD5280/AD5282 can be supplied by dual supplies, the general equation defining the \noutput voltage at V\nW with respect to ground for any valid  \n AD5280/AD5282\n \nRev.

Unlike rheostat mode, the output voltage is dependent mainly on the ratio of the internal resistors R\nWA and R WB and not on the absolute \nvalues; therefore, the temperature drift reduces to 5 ppm/°C. \n \n \n19 1 1 99\nSCL\nSDA\nSTART BY\nMASTERFRAME 1\nSLAVE ADDRESS BYTEACK.

C | Page 16 of 28 DIGITAL INTERFACE \n2-WIRE SERIAL BUS \nThe AD5280/AD5282 are controlled via an I2C-compatible serial \nbus. The RDACs are connected to this bus as slave devices.  As \nshown in Figure 45 , Figure 46 , and Table 6 , the first byte of the \nAD5280/AD5282 is a slave address byte. It has a 7-bit slave \naddress and an R/ W bit. \nThe 5 MSBs are 01011, and the two bits that follow are deter-\nmined by the state of the AD0 pin and the AD1 pin of the \ndevice. AD0 and AD1 allow the user to place up to four of the I\n2C-compatible devices on one bus. The 2-wire I2C serial bus \nprotocol operates as follows. \nThe master initiates data transfer by establishing a start condi-\ntion, which happens when a high-to-low transition on the SDA line occurs while SCL is high (see Figure 45 ). The following \nbyte is the slave address byte, which consists of the 7-bit slave \naddress followed by an R/ W\n bit (this bit determines whether \ndata is read from or written to the slave device). \nThe slave whose address corresponds to the transmitted address \nresponds by pulling the SDA line low during the ninth clock \npulse (this is called the acknowledge bit). At this stage, all other devices on the bus remain idle while the selected device waits for \ndata to be written to or read from its serial register. If the R/ W\n bit \nis high, the master reads from the slave device. On the other hand, if the R/ W\n bit is low, the master writes to the slave device. \nA write operation contains one instruction byte more than a \nread operation. Such an instruction byte in write mode follows the slave address byte. The most significant bit (MSB) of the \ninstruction byte labeled A\n/B is the RDAC subaddress select. A \nlow selects RDAC1 and a high selects RDAC2 for the dual channel AD5282. Set A\n/B low for the AD5280. \nRS, the second MSB, is the midscale reset. A logic high on this \nbit moves the wiper of a selected channel to the center tap where RW A = RWB. This feature effectively writes over the contents of the register and thus, when taken out of reset mode, the RDAC remains at midscale. \nSD, the third MSB, is a shutdown bit. A logic high causes the \nselected channel to open circuit at Terminal A while shorting \nthe wiper to Terminal B. This operation yields almost 0 Ω \n\uf020in \nrheostat mode or 0 V in potentiometer mode. This SD bit serves \nthe same function as the SHDN  pin except that the SHDN  pin \nreacts to active low. Also, the SHDN  pin affects both channels \n(AD5282) as opposed to the SD bit, which affects only the \nchannel that is being written to. Note that the shutdown operation does not disturb the contents of the register. When brought out of shutdown, the previous setting is applied to  \nthe RDAC. \nThe following two bits are O\n1 and O 2. They are extra program-\nmable logic outputs that can be used to drive other digital loads, \nlogic gates, LED drivers, analog switches, and so on. The three \nLSBs are don’t care bits (see Figure 45 ). \nAfter acknowledging the instruction byte, the last byte in write \nmode is the data byte. Data is transmitted over the serial bus in sequences of nine clock pulses (eight data bits followed by an acknowledge bit). The transitions on the SDA line must occur during the low period of SCL and remain stable during the high period of SCL (see Figure 45 ). \nIn read mode, the data byte follows immediately after the acknowledgment of the slave address byte. Data is transmitted over the serial bus in sequences of nine clock pulses (a slight difference from write mode, where there are eight data bits followed by an acknowledge bit). Similarly, the transitions on the SDA line must occur during the low period of SCL and remain stable during the high period of SCL (see Figure 46 ). \nWhen all data bits have been read or written, a stop condition is established by the master. A stop condition is defined as a low-to-high transition on the SDA line while SCL is high. In write mode, the master pulls the SDA line high during the tenth clock pulse to establish a stop condition (see Figure 45 ). In read \nmode, the master issues a no acknowledge for the ninth clock \npulse (that is, the SDA line remains high). The master then \nbrings the SDA line low before the 10th clock pulse, which goes \nhigh to establish a stop condition (see Figure 46 ). \nA repeated write function gives the user flexibility to update the \nRDAC output a number of times after addressing and instructing the part only once. During the write cycle, each data byte updates the RDAC output. For example, after the RDAC has acknow-\nledged its slave address and instruction bytes, the RDAC output \nupdates after these two bytes. If another byte is written to the RDAC while it is still addressed to a specific slave device with the same instruction, this byte updates the output of the selected slave device. If different instructions are needed, the write mode has to \nstart with a new slave address, instruction, and data byte again. \nSimilarly, a repeated read function of RDAC is also allowed. \n \n AD5280/AD5282\n \nRev. C | Page 17 of 28 READBACK RDAC VALUE \nThe AD5280/AD5282 allow the user to read back the RDAC \nvalues in read mode. However, for the dual-channel AD5282, the channel of interest is the one that is previously selected in \nthe write mode. When users need to read the RDAC values of \nboth channels in the AD5282, they can program the first subaddress in write mode and then change to read mode to read the first channel value. After that, they can change back to write mode with the second subaddress and read the second channel \nvalue in read mode again. It is not necessary for users to issue \nthe Frame 3 data byte in write mode for subsequent readback operation. Users should refer to Figure 45  and Figure 46  for the \nprogramming format. \nADDITIONAL PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC OUTPUT \nThe AD5280/AD5282 feature addi tional programmable logic \noutputs, O 1 and O 2, which can be used to drive a digital load, \nanalog switches, and logic gates. O 1 and O 2 default to Logic 0. The \nlogic states of O 1 and O 2 can be programmed in Frame 2 under \nwrite mode (see Figure 45 ). These logic outputs have adequate \ncurrent driving capability to sink/source milliamperes of load. \nUsers can also activate O 1 and O 2 in three ways without \naffecting the wiper settings by programming as follows: \n• Perform start, slave address, acknowledge, and instruction \nbytes with O 1 and O 2 specified, acknowledge, stop. \n• Complete the write cycle with stop, then start, slave address \nbyte, acknowledge, instruction byte with O 1 and O 2 \nspecified, acknowledge, stop. \n• Not complete the write cycle by not issuing the stop, then start, slave address byte, acknowledge, instruction byte with O\n1 and O 2 specified, acknowledge, stop. \nSELF-CONTAINED SHUTDOWN FUNCTION AND \nPROGRAMMABLE PRESET \nShutdown can be activated by strobing the SHDN  pin or \nprogramming the SD bit in the write mode instruction byte.  \nAs shown in , when shutdown is asserted, the \nAD5280/AD5282 open SW A to let the A terminal float and \nshort the W terminal to the B terminal. The AD5280/AD5282 \nconsume negligible power during shutdown mode, resuming \nthe previous setting once the Figure 44\nSHDN  pin is released. In addition, shutdown can be implemented with the device \ndigital output as shown in Figure 47 . In this configuration, the \ndevice is shut down during power-up, but the user is allowed to \nprogram the device at any preset levels. When it is done, the \nuser programs O 1 high with the valid coding and the device \nexits from shutdown and responds to the new setting. This self-contained shutdown function allows absolute shutdown during power-up, which is crucial in hazardous environments, without \nadding extra components. Also, the sleep mode programming \nfeature during shutdown allows the AD5280/AD5282 to have a programmable preset at any level, a solution that can be as effective as using other high cost EEPROM devices. Because of the extra power drawn on R\nPD, note that a high value should be \nchosen for the R PD. \nSDASHDN\nSCLRPDO1\n02929-046 \nFigure 47.

When two systems operate the same signal at two different voltages, proper level \nshifting is needed. For instance, a 3.3 V EEPROM can interface \nwith a 5 V digital potentiometer. A level-shift scheme is needed to enable a bidirectional communication so that the setting of the digital potentiometer can be stored to and retrieved from the EEPROM.

These applications are sometimes operated between ground and a negative supply voltage such that the systems can be biased at ground to avoid large bypass \ncapacitors that may significantly impede the ac performance. \nLike most digital potentiometers, the AD5280/AD5282 can be \nconfigured with a negative supply (see Figure 50 ). \n–5V\nLEVEL SHIFTEDVDD\nVSS\nGND\nSDASCL\n02929-0 49\n \nFigure 50.

In this state, V\nOUT approaches 0 V . When V IN is above 2 V , Q3 is on, Q1 is on, \nand Q2 is turned off.

Maximum Terminal Voltages Set by V DD and V SS \n \nPOWER-UP SEQUENCE \nBecause there are ESD protection diodes that limit the voltage \ncompliance at Terminal A, Terminal B, and Terminal W (see \nFigure 53 ), it is important to power V DD/V SS before applying any \nvoltage to the A, B, and W terminals. Otherwise, the diode is forward biased such that V\nDD/V SS is unintentionally powered, \nwhich may affect the rest of the user’s circuit. The ideal power-up sequence is the following: GND, V\nDD, V SS, digital inputs, and \nVA/V B/V W. The order of powering V A/V B/V W and digital inputs \nis not important as long as they are powered after V DD/V SS. \n AD5280/AD5282\n \nRev. C | Page 19 of 28 LAYOUT AND POWER SUPPLY BYPASSING \nIt is a good practice to design a layout with compact, minimum \nlead lengths. The leads to the input should be as direct as possible \nwith a minimum conductor length. Ground paths should have \nlow resistance and low inductance.

Supply leads to \nthe device should be bypassed with 0.01 μF to 0.1 μF disc or \nchip ceramic capacitors. Low ESR 1 μF to 10 μF tantalum or electrolytic capacitors should also be applied at the supplies to minimize any transient disturbance and filter low frequency ripple (see Figure 54 ). Notice that the digital ground should also \nbe joined remotely to the analog ground at one point to \nminimize digital ground bounce.  \nFigure 54. Power Supply Bypassing \n \nAD5280/AD5282 \n \nRev. C | Page 20 of 28 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nDepending on the op amp GBP , reducing the feedback resistor \nmay extend the zero’s frequency far enough to overcome the problem. A better approach is to include a compensation capacitor C2 to cancel the effect caused by C1. Optimum \ncompensation occurs when R1 × C1 = R2 × C2. This is not  \nan option unless C2 is scaled as if R2 were at its maximum value. Doing so may overcompensate and compromise the performance slightly when R2 is set at low values. However, it avoids the gain peaking, ringing, or oscillation at the worst case. \nFor critical applications, C2 should be found empirically to suit \nthe need. In general, C2 in the range of a few picofarads (pF) to no more than a few tenths of a picofarad is usually adequate for \nthe compensation. BIPOLAR DC OR AC OPERATION FROM DUAL \nSUPPLIES \nThe AD5280/AD5282 can be operated from dual supplies \nenabling control of ground-referenced ac signals or bipolar \noperation. The ac signal, as high as V DD/V SS, can be applied \ndirectly across Terminal A to Terminal B with the output taken \nfrom T erminal W .

Typical Noninverting Gain Amplifier \nNotice that the RDAC B terminal parasitic capacitance is \nconnected to the op amp noninverting node. It introduces a 0 for the 1/β\nO term with 20 dB/decade (dec), whereas a typical op \namp GBP has −20 dB/dec characteristics. A large R2 and finite C1 can cause the 0 frequency to fall well below the crossover frequency. Thus the rate of closure becomes 40 dB/dec, and the system has a 0° phase margin at the crossover frequency. The output may ring or oscillate if the input is a rectangular pulse or \nstep function. Similarly, it is also likely to ring when switching \nbetween two gain values because this is equivalent to a step \nchange at the input. \n02929-057AD5280U2\nAD8512V+\nV–\nAD8512VDD\nRBIAS\nVOVDD\nU1B ADR512D1\nR2\nR1B200kΩU1A\n \nFigure 57. 8-Bit I2C DAC \nAD5280/AD5282 can be configured as a high voltage DAC, as high as 15 V .

Although the circuit works under single supply, the programmable resolution of the \nsystem is reduced. \nFor applications that demand higher current capabilities, a  \nfew changes to the circuit in Figure 61  produce an adjustable \ncurrent in the range of hundreds of milliamps. First, the voltage reference needs to be replaced with a high current, low dropout regulator, such as the ADP3333 , and the op amp needs to be \nswapped with a high current dual-supply model, such as the AD8532. Depending on the desired range of current, an \nappropriate value for R\nS must be calculated. Because of the high \ncurrent flowing to the load, the user must pay attention to the \nload impedance so as not to drive the op amp beyond the \npositive rail.

At the resonant frequency, f O, \nthe overall phase shift is 0, and the positive feedback causes the \ncircuit to oscillate.

On the other hand, the alternate turn-\non of Diode D1 and Diode D2 ensures that R2/R1 are smaller \nthan 2 momentarily and, therefore, stabilizes the oscillation. \nOnce the frequency is set, the oscillation amplitude can be \ntuned by R2 B because \nD B D OV R2 I V+ =32 (17) \nVO, ID, and V D are interdependent variables.
