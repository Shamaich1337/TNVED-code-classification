They consume a mere 25μA quiescent \ncurrent per amplifier, yet achieve 200kHz gain-bandwidth \nproduct and are unity-gain stable while driving any capacitive \nload. The MAX4162/MAX4163/MAX4164 operate from \neither a single supply (2.5V to 10V) or dual supplies \n(±1.25V to ±5V), with an input common-mode voltage \nrange that extends 250mV beyond either supply rail. These \namplifiers use a proprietary architecture to achieve a very  \nhigh input common-mode rejection ratio without the  \nmidswing nonlinearities present in other rail-to-rail op \namps. This architecture also maintains high open-loop gain \nand output swing while driving substantial loads.\nThe combination of excellent bandwidth/power performance, \nsingle-supply operation, and miniature footprint makes these \nop amps ideal for portable equipment and other low-power, \nsingle-supply applications. The single MAX4162 is available \nin 8-pin SO and space-saving 5-pin SOT23 packages. The  \nMAX4163 is available in an 8-pin ultra chip-scale  \npackage (UCSP™) and an 8-pin μMAX ® or SO package. \nThe MAX4164 is available in a 14-pin SO package.\nApplications\n ●Battery-Powered Devices\n ●pH Probes\n ●Portable Equipment\n ●Low-Power, Low-Voltage  \n Equipment   ●Medical Instruments\n ●Ionization Detectors\n ●Cellular PhonesFeatures\n ●UCSP Package (MAX4163)\n ●1.0pA Typical Input Bias Current\n ●Single-Supply Operation from 2.5V to 10V\n ●Input Common-Mode Voltage Range Extends  \n250mV Beyond Either Supply Rail\n ●Rail-to-Rail Output Swing\n ●200kHz Gain-Bandwidth Product\n ●25μA Quiescent Current per Amplifier\n ●Excellent CMRR, PSRR, and Gain Linearity\n ●No Phase Reversal for Overdriven Inputs\n ●Unity-Gain Stable\n ●Stable with Any Capacitive Load\n ●Internally Short-Circuit Protected to Either Rail\n19-1195; Rev 4; 8/19UCSP is a trademark and μMAX is a registered trademark of \nMaxim Integrated Products, Inc.Pin Configuration appears at end of data sheet.+Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.  \nT = Tape and reel.  \n*UCSP reliability is integrally linked to the user’s assembly \nmethods, circuit board material, and environment.

Although the minimum operating voltage is specified at \n2.5V, the devices typically provide full rail-to-rail operation \nbelow 2.0V (Figure 1). These amplifiers do not suffer from \nmidswing common-mode-rejection degradation or cross -\nover nonlinearity often encountered in other rail-to-rail op amps. Extremely low, 1.0pA input bias current makes \nthese devices ideal for applications such as pH probes, \nelectrometers, and ionization detectors. They are also \nprotected against phase reversal (inferred from CMRR \ntest) and latchup for input signals extending beyond the \nsupply rails. The output stage achieves a lower output  \nimpedance than traditional rail-to-rail output stages,  \nproviding an output voltage range that typically swings \nwithin 150mV of the supply rails for 1mA loads. This  \narchitecture also maintains high open-loop gain and  \noutput swing while driving substantial loads.\nOutput Loading and Stability\nThese devices drive 1mA loads to within 150mV of the \nsupply rails while consuming only 25μA of quiescent  \ncurrent. Internal compensation allows these amplifiers to \nremain unity-gain stable while driving any capacitive load \n(Figure 2).\nInternal Charge Pump\nAn internal charge pump provides two internal supplies \ntypically 2V beyond each rail. These internal rails allow \nthe MAX4162/MAX4163/MAX4164 to achieve true rail-to-\nrail inputs and outputs, while providing excellent common-\nmode rejection, power-supply rejection ratios, and gain \nlinearity.\nThese charge pumps require no external components, \nand in most applications are entirely transparent to the  \nuser. Two characteristics may be visible to the user, \ndepending on the application: Insert caption here and position to the layout. Figure 1.

The amplitude of this noise is typically \n100μV P-P. The noise is not referred to the input, and \nis independent of amplifier gain. The charge-pump \nswitching frequency is well beyond the amplifier’s \n200kHz bandwidth, and is therefore unnoticeable in \nmost applications.\n2) The charge pumps typically require up to 20μs on \npower-up to fully energize the internal supply rails \n(Figure 3).\nPower Supplies and Layout\nThe MAX4162/MAX4163/MAX4164 are guaranteed to \noperate from a single 2.5V to 10.0V power supply, but \nfull rail-to-rail operation typically extends below 2V. For \nsingle-supply operation, bypass the power supply with a \n1μF capacitor in parallel with a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor. \nIf operating from dual supplies, bypass each supply to \nground.\nGood layout improves performance by decreasing the \namount of stray capacitance at the op amp’s inputs and \noutput. To decrease stray capacitance, minimize both \ntrace and external component lead lengths, and place \nexternal components close to the op amp’s pins.UCSP Package Consideration\nFor general UCSP package information and PC layout \nconsiderations, please refer to the Maxim Application \nNote (Wafer-Level Ultra-Chip-Board-Scale-Package).\nUCSP Reliability\nThe UCSP represents a unique packaging form factor \nthat may not perform equally to a packaged product \nthrough traditional mechanical reliability tests. UCSP  \nreliability is integrally linked to the user’s assembly  \nmethods, circuit board material, and usage environment. \nThe user should closely review these areas when considering \nuse of a UCSP. Performance through operating life test \nand moisture resistance remains uncompromised as it \nis primarily determined by the wafer-fabrication process. \nMechanical stress performance is a greater consideration \nfor a UCSP package. UCSPs are attached through direct \nsolder contact to the user’s PC board, foregoing the inherent \nstress relief of a packaged product lead frame. Solder \njoint contact integrity must be considered.\nTable 1 shows the testing done to characterize the UCSP \nreliability performance. In conclusion, the UCSP is capable \nof performing reliably through environmental stresses as \nindicated by the results in the table.
