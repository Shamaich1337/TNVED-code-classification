In a typical implementation, motor currents fl  ow through an external \nresistor and the resulting analog voltage drop is sensed by the HCPL-7840.  A diff  erential output voltage is created on \nthe other side of the HCPL-7840 optical isolation barrier.  This diff  erential output voltage is proportional to the \nmotor current and can be converted to a single-ended signal by using an op-amp as shown in the recommended application circuit.  Since common-mode voltage swings of several hundred volts in tens of nanoseconds are common in modern switching inverter motor drives, the HCPL-7840 was designed to ignore very high common-mode transient slew rates (of at least 10 kV/μs).\nThe high CMR capability of the HCPL-7840 isolation \namplifi  er provides the precision and stability needed to \naccurately monitor motor current in high noise motor control environ-ments, providing for smoother control (less “torque ripple”) in various types of motor control applications.\nThe product can also be used for general analog signal \nisolation applications requiring high accuracy, stability, and linearity under similarly severe noise con-ditions.  For general applications, we recommend the HCPL-7840 (gain tolerance of ± 5%). The HCPL-7840 utilizes sigma delta (∑-Δ) analog-to-digital converter technology, chopper stabilized amplifi  ers, and a fully diff  erential circuit topol-\nogy fabricated using Avago’s 0.8 μm CMOS IC process.  Together, these features deliver unequaled isolation-mode noise rejection, as well as excellent off  set and gain \naccuracy and stability over time and temperature.  This performance is delivered in a compact, auto-insertable, industry standard 8-pin DIP package that meets world-wide regulatory safety standards.  (A gull-wing surface mount option #300 is also available).\nCAUTION:  It is advised that normal static precautions be taken in handling and assemblyof this component to prevent damage and/ or degradation which may be induced by ESD.1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5IDD1\nVDD1\nVIN+\nVIN–\nGND1IDD2\nVDD2\nVOUT+\nVOUT–\nGND2+\n–+\n–\nSHIELDHCPL-7840\nIsolation Amplifi  er\nData Sheet  \nFeatures\n\uf0b7  15 kV/μs common-mode rejection at VCM = 1000 V\n\uf0b7 Compact, auto-insertable standard 8-pin DIP package\n\uf0b7 0.00025 V/V/°C gain drift vs. temperature\n\uf0b7 0.3 mV input off  set voltage\n\uf0b7 100 kHz bandwidth\n\uf0b7 0.004% nonlinearity\n\uf0b7 Worldwide safety approval:     \nUL 1577 (3750 Vrms/1 min.) and CSA, IEC/EN/DIN EN 60747-5-2\n\uf0b7 Advanced Sigma-Delta (∑-Δ) A/D converter technol-\nogy\n\uf0b7 Fully diff  erential circuit topology\n\uf0b7 0.8 μm CMOS IC technology\nApplications\n\uf0b7 Motor phase and rail current sensing\n\uf0b7 Inverter current sensing\n\uf0b7 Switched mode power supply signal isolation\n\uf0b7 General purpose current sensing and monitoring\n\uf0b7 General purpose analog signal isolation\nFunctional Diagram \nA 0.1 μF bypass capacitor must be connected \nbetween pins 1 and 4 and between pins 5 and 8.\nLead (Pb) Free\nRoHS 6 fully\ncompliant\nRoHS 6 fully co mpliant options available;\n-xxxE denotes a lead-f ree product\n2Ordering Information\nHCPL-7840 is UL Recognized with 3750 Vrms for 1 minute per UL1577.

Typical drift specifi  ca-\ntions are determined by calculating the rate of change of the specifi  ed \nparameter versus the drift pa-ramet er (at nominal operating conditions) \nfor each characterization unit, and then averaging the individual unit rates.  The corresponding drift fi  gures are normalized to the nominal \noperating conditions and show how much drift occurs as the par-ticular drift parameter is varied from its nominal value, with all other param-eters held at their nominal operating values.  Note that the typical drift specifi  cations in the tables below may diff  er from the slopes of the mean \ncurves shown in the corresponding fi  gures.\n 1.  Avago recommends operation with  V\nIN- = 0 V (tied to GND1).  \nLimiting VIN+ to 100 mV will improve DC nonlinearity and nonlinear-\nity drift.  If VIN- is brought above VDD1 – 2 V, an internal  test mode may \nbe activated.  This test mode is for testing LED coupling and is not intended for customer use.\n 2.  This is the Absolute Value of Input Off  set Change vs. Temperature.\n 3.  Gain is defi  ned as the slope of the best-fi  t line of diff  erential output \nvoltage  (V\nOUT+–VOUT- ) vs. diff  erential input voltage (VIN+–VIN-) \nover the specifi  ed input range.\n 4.  This is the Absolute Value of Gain Change vs. Temperature. 5.  Nonlinearity is defi  ned as half of the peak-to-peak output deviation \nfrom the best-fi  t gain line, expressed as a percentage of the full-scale \ndiff erential output voltage.\n 6.  NL\n100 is the nonlinearity specifi  ed over an input voltage range of \n±100 mV. \n 7.  The input supply current decreases as the diff  erential input voltage \n(VIN+–VIN-) decreases.\n 8.  The maximum specifi  ed output supply current occurs when the \ndiff erential input voltage (VIN+–VIN-) = -200 mV, the maximum rec-\nommended operat-ing input voltage.  However, the out-put supply current will continue to rise for diff  erential input voltages up to \napproximately -300 mV, beyond which the output supply current remains constant.\n 9.  Because of the switched-capacitor nature of the input sigma-delta \ncon-verter, time-averaged values are shown.\n10.  When the diff  erential input signal exceeds approximately 308 mV, \nthe outputs will limit at the typical values shown.11.  Short circuit current is the amount of output current generated \nwhen either output is shorted to V\nDD2 or ground.\n12.  CMRR is defined as the ratio of the differential signal \ngain (signal applied differentially between pins 2 and 3) to the common-mode gain (input pins tied together and the signal applied to both inputs at the same time), expressed in dB.\n13.  Output noise comes from two primary sources: chopper noise \nand sigma-delta quantization noise.  Chopper noise results from chopper stabilization of the output op-amps.  It occurs at a specifi  c \nfrequency (typically 400 kHz at room temperature), and is not at-tenuated by the internal output fi  lter.  A fi  lter circuit can be easily \nadded to the external post-amplifi  er to reduce the total rms output \nnoise.  The internal output fi  lter does eliminate most, but not \nall, of the sigma-delta quantization noise.  The magnitude of the output quantization noise is very small at lower frequencies (below 10 kHz) and increases with increasing frequency. \n14.  CMTI (Common Mode Transient Immunity or CMR, Common Mode \nRejection) is tested by applying an exponentially rising/falling voltage step on pin 4 (GND1) with respect to pin 5 (GND2).  The rise time of the test waveform is set to approximately 50 ns. The ampli-tude of the step is adjusted until  the diff  erential output (V\nOUT+–VOUT-) \nexhibits more than a 200 mV deviation from the average output voltage for more than 1μs.  The HCPL-7840 will continue to func-tion if more than  10 kV/μs common mode slopes are applied, as long as the breakdown voltage limitations are observed. \n15.  Data sheet value is the diff  erential amplitude of the transient at the \noutput of the HCPL-7840 when a 1 V\npk-pk, 1 MHz square wave with \n40 ns rise and fall times is applied to both VDD1 and VDD2.\n16.  In accordance with UL 1577, each optocoupler is proof tested by ap-\nplying an insulation test voltage ≥4500 Vrms for 1 second (leakage detection current limit, I\nI-O ≤ 5 μA).  This test is performed before the \n100% production test for partial discharge (method b) shown in IEC/EN/DIN EN 60747-5-2 Insulation Characteristic Table.\n17.  The Input-Output Momentary With stand Voltage is a dielectric \nvoltage rating that should not be interpreted as an input-output continuous voltage rating.  For the continuous voltage rating refer to the VDE 0884 insula tion characteristics table and your equipment level safety specifi  cation.\n18.

A fl  oating power supply (which in many \napplications could be the same supply that is used to drive the high-side power transistor) is regulated to 5 V using a simple zener diode (D1); the value of resistor R4 should be chosen to supply suffi   cient current from \nthe existing fl  oating supply.  The voltage from the current \nsensing resistor (Rsense) is applied to the input of the HCPL-7840 through an RC anti-aliasing fi  lter (R2 and C2).  \nAlthough the application circuit is relatively simple, a few recommendations should be followed to ensure optimal performance.The power supply for the HCPL -7840 is most often ob-\ntained from the same supply used to power the power transistor gate drive circuit.  If a dedicated supply is re-quired, in many cases it is possible to add an additional winding on an existing transformer.  Otherwise, some sort of simple isolated supply can be used, such as a line powered transformer or a high-frequency DC-DC converter.\nAn inexpensive 78L05 three-terminal regulator can also \nbe used to reduce the fl  oating supply voltage to 5 V.  To \nhelp attenuate high-frequency power supply noise or ripple, a resistor or inductor can be used in series with the input of the regulator to form a low-pass fi  lter with \nthe regulator’s input bypass capacitor.\nFigure 17.

To obtain optimal CMTI performance, the layout of the PC board should minimize any stray coupling by maintaining the maximum possible distance between the input and output sides of the circuit and ensuring that any ground or power plane on the PC board does not pass directly below or extend much wider than the body of the HCPL-7840.\nFigure 19. Example printed circuit board layout.C3C2 C4R5\nTO R SENSE+\nTO R SENSE–TO V DD1\nTO V DD2\nVOUT+\nVOUT–\n16Figure 20. Motor output horsepower vs. motor \nphase current and supply voltage.the output voltage across the resistor is also reduced, which means that the off  set and noise, which are fi  xed, \nbecome a larger percentage of the signal amplitude.   The selected value of the sense resistor will fall somewhere between the minimum and maximum values, depending on the particular requirements of a specifi  c design.\nWhen sensing currents large enough to cause signifi  cant \nheating of the sense resistor, the temperature coeffi   cient \n(tempco) of the resistor can introduce nonlinearity due to the signal dependent temperature rise of the resistor.  The eff  ect increases as the resistor-to-ambient ther-mal \nresistance increases.  This eff  ect can be minimized by \nreducing the thermal resistance of the current sensing resistor or by using a resistor with a lower tempco.  Lower-ing the thermal resistance can be accomplished by repo-sitioning the current sensing resistor on the PC board, by using larger PC board traces to carry away more heat, or by using a heat sink.\nFor a two-terminal current sensing resistor, as the value \nof  resistance decreases, the re-sistance of the leads become a signifi  cant percentage of the total  resistance.  \nThis has two primary eff  ects on resistor accuracy.  First, \nthe eff  ective resistance of the sense resistor can become \ndependent on factors such as how long the leads are, how they are bent, how far they are inserted into the board, and how far solder wicks up the leads during assembly (these issues will be discussed in more detail shortly).  Second, the leads are typically made from a material, such as copper, which has a much higher tempco than the material from which the resistive element itself is made, resulting in a higher tempco overall.\nBoth of these eff  ects are eliminated when a four-terminal \ncurrent sensing resistor is used.  A four-terminal resistor has two additional terminals that are Kelvin-connected directly across the resistive element itself; these two ter-minals are used to monitor the voltage across the resistive element while the other two terminals are used to carry the load current.  Because of the Kelvin connection, any voltage drops across the leads carrying the load current should have no impact on the measured voltage.\nWhen laying out a PC board for the current \nsensing resistors, a couple of points should be kept in mind.  The Kelvin connections to the resistor should be brought together under the body of the resistor and then run very close to each other to the input of the HCPL-7840; this minimizes the loop area of the connection and reduces the possibility of stray mag-netic fi  elds from interfering with the measured signal.  If \nthe sense resistor is not located on the same PC board as the HCPL-7840 circuit, a tightly twisted pair of wires can accomplish the same thing.Current Sensing Resistors\nThe current sensing resistor should have low resistance (to minimize power dissipation), low inductance (to minimize di/dt induced voltage spikes which could adversely aff  ect operation), and reasonable tolerance \n(to maintain overall circuit accuracy).  Choosing a par-ticular value for the resistor is usually a compro-mise between minimizing power dissipation and maximiz-ing accu-racy.  Smaller sense resistance decreases power dissipation, while larger sense resistance can improve circuit accuracy by utilizing the full input range of the HCPL -7840.\nThe fi  rst step in selecting a sense resistor is determining \nhow much current the resistor will be sensing.  The graph in Figure 20 shows the RMS current in each phase of a three-phase induction motor as a function of average motor output power (in horse-power, hp) and motor drive supply voltage.  The maximum value of the sense re-sistor is determined by the current being measured and the maxi-mum recommended input voltage of the isolation amplifi  er.  The maximum sense resistance can \nbe calculated by taking the maxi-mum recommended input voltage and dividing by the peak current that the sense resistor should see during normal operation.  For example, if a motor will have a maximum RMS current of 10 A and can experience up to 50% overloads during normal op-eration, then the peak current is 21.1 A (=10 x 1.414 x 1.5).  Assuming a maximum input voltage of 200 mV, the maximum value of sense resistance in this case would be about 10 mΩ.\nThe maximum average power dissipation in the sense \nresistor can also be easily calculated by multiplying the sense resistance times the square of the maximum RMS current, which is about 1 W in the previous example. If the power dissipation in the sense resistor is too high, the resistance can be decreased below the maximum value to decrease power dissipation.  The minimum value of the sense resistor is limited by precision and accuracy require-ments of the design.  As the resistance value is reduced, \nMOTOR PHASE CURRENT – A (rms)15\n540\n10 25 30035\n03 525\n10\n20440 V\n380 V\n220 V120 V30\n20\n5\n15\n17Also, multiple layers of the PC board can be used to \nincrease current carrying capacity.  Numerous plated-through vias should surround each non-Kelvin terminal of the sense resistor to help distribute the current between the layers of the PC board.  The PC board should use 2 or 4 oz. copper for the layers, resulting in a current carrying capacity in excess of  20 A.  Making the current carrying traces on the PC board fairly large can also improve the sense resistor’s power dissipation capability by acting as a heat sink.  Liberal use of vias where the load current enters and exits the PC board is also recommended.\nSense Resistor Connections\nThe recommended method for connecting the HCPL-7840 \nto the current sensing resistor is shown in Figure 18.  V\nIN+ \n(pin 2 of the HPCL-7840) is connected to the positive terminal of the sense resistor resistor, while V\nIN- (pin 3) is \nshorted to GND1 (pin 4), with the power-supply return path functioning as the sense line to the negative termi-nal of the current sense resistor.  This allows a single pair of wires or PC board traces to connect the HCPL-7840 circuit to the sense resistor.  By referencing the input circuit to the negative side of the sense resistor, any load current induced noise transients on the resistor are seen as a common-mode signal and will not interfere with the current-sense signal.  This is important because the large load currents fl  owing through the motor drive, along with \nthe parasitic inductances inherent in the wiring of the circuit, can generate both noise spikes and off  sets that are \nrelatively large compared to the small voltages that are being measured across the current sensing resistor.  \nIf the same power supply is used both for the gate drive \ncircuit and for the current sensing circuit, it is very impor-tant that the connection from GND1 of the HCPL-7840 to the sense resistor be the only return path for supply current to the gate drive power supply in order to elimi-nate potential ground loop problems.  The only direct connection between the HCPL-7840 circuit and the gate drive circuit should be the positive power supply line.  Output Side\nThe op-amp used in the external post-amplifi  er circuit \nshould be of suffi   ciently high precision so that it does not \ncontribute  a signifi  cant amount of off  set or off  set drift \nrelative to the contribution from the isolation amplifi  er.  \nGenerally, op-amps with bipolar input stages exhibit better off  set performance than op-amps with JFET or \nMOSFET input stages.\nIn addition, the op-amp should also have enough \nbandwidth and slew rate so that it does not adversely aff ect the response speed of the overall circuit.  The \npost-amplifi  er circuit includes a pair of capacitors (C5 \nand C6) that form a single-pole low-pass fi  lter; these \ncapacitors allow the bandwidth of the post-amp to be adjusted independently of the gain and are useful for reducing the output noise from the isola-tion amplifi  er.  \nMany diff  erent op-amps could be used in the circuit, \nincluding: MC34082A (Motorola), TLO32A, TLO52A, and TLC277 (Texas Instruments), LF412A (National Semicon-ductor).\nThe gain-setting resistors in the post-amp should have a \ntolerance of 1% or better to ensure adequate CMRR and adequate gain toler-ance for the overall circuit.  Resistor networks can be used that have much better ratio toler-ances than can be achieved using discrete resistors.  A resistor network also reduces the total number of com-ponents for the circuit as well as the required board space.\nPlease refer to Avago Applications Note 1078 for addi-\ntional information on using Isolation Amplifi  ers.\n18FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HCPL-7840\n1.  THE BASICS1.1:  Why should I use the HCPL-7840 for sensing current when Hall-eff  ect sensors are available which don’t need an \nisolated supply voltage?\n Available in an auto-insertable, 8-pin DIP package, the HCPL-7840 is smaller than and has better linearity, off  set vs. \ntemperature and Common Mode Rejection (CMR) performance than most Hall-eff  ect sensors.  Additionally, often \nthe required input-side power supply can be derived from the same supply that powers the gate-drive optocoupler.\n2.  SENSE RESISTOR AND INPUT FILTER2.1:  Where do I get 10 mΩ resistors? I have never seen one that low. Although less common than values above 10 Ω, there are quite a few manufacturers of resistors suitable for \nmeasuring currents up to 50 A when combined with the HCPL- 7840. Example product information may be found at Dale’s web site (http://www.vishay.com/vishay/dale) and Isotek’s web site (http://www.isotekcorp.com).          \n2.2:  Should I connect both inputs across the sense resistor instead of grounding V\nIN- directly to pin 4?\n This is not necessary, but it will work.  If you do, be sure to use an RC fi  lter on both pin 2 (VIN+) and pin 3 (VIN-)  to \nlimit the input voltage at both pads.         \n2.3:  Do I really need an RC fi  lter on the input? What is it for?  Are other values of R and C okay? \n The input anti-aliasing fi  lter (R=39 Ω, C=0.01 μF) shown in the typical application circuit is recommended for fi  l-\ntering fast switching voltage transients from the input signal.  (This helps to attenuate higher signal frequencies which could otherwise alias with the input sampling rate and cause higher input off  set voltage.)\nSome issues to keep in mind using diff  erent fi  lter resistors or capacitors are:\n1.  (Filter resistor:)  Input bias current for pins 2 and 3:  This is on the order of 500 nA.  If you are using a single fi  lter \nresistor in series with pin 2 but not pin 3 the IxR drop across this resistor will add to the off  set error of the device.  \nAs long as this IR drop is small compared to the input off  set voltage there should not be a problem.  If larger-\nvalued resistors are used in series, it is better to put half of the resistance in series with pin 2 and half the resistance in series with pin 3.  In this case, the off  set voltage is due mainly to resistor mismatch (typically less than 1% of \nthe resistance design value) multiplied by the input bias.\n2. (Filter resistor:)  The equivalent input resistance for -7840  is around 500 kΩ.  It is therefore best to ensure \nthat the fi  lter resistance is not a signifi  cant percentage of this value; otherwise the off  set voltage will \nbe increased through the resistor divider eff  ect.  [As an example, if R\nfi lt = 5.5 kΩ, then VOS = (Vin * 1%) = \n2 mV for a maximum 200 mV input and VOS will vary with respect with Vin.]\n3.  The input bandwidth is changed as a result of this diff  erent R-C fi  lter confi  guration.  In fact this is one of the main \nreasons for changing the input-fi  lter R-C time constant. \n4.  (Filter capacitance:)  The input capacitance of the -78XX is approximately 1.5 pF.  For proper operation the switch-\ning input-side sampling capacitors must be charged from a relatively fi  xed (low impedance) voltage source.  \nTherefore, if a fi  lter capacitor is used it is best for this capacitor to be a few orders of magnitude greater than the \nCINPUT (A value of at least 100 pF works well.)\n2.4:  How do I ensure that the HCPL-7840 is not destroyed as a result of short circuit conditions which cause voltage \ndrops across the sense resistor that exceed the ratings of the HCPL-7840’s inputs?\n Select the sense resistor so that it will have less than 5 V drop when short circuits occur.  The only other require-\nment is to shut down the drive before the sense resistor is damaged or its solder joints melt.  This ensures that the input of the HCPL-7840 can not be damaged by sense resistors going open-circuit. \nFor product information and a complete list of distributors, please go to our website:         www.avagotech.com\nAvago, Avago Technologies, and the A logo are trademarks of Avago Technologies in the United States and other countries.\nData subject to change.

The momentary (1 minute) withstand voltage is 3750 V rms per UL 1577 and CSA Component Acceptance \nNotice #5.\n4.  ACCURACY 4.1:  Can the signal to noise ratio be improved? Yes. Some noise energy exists beyond the 100 kHz bandwidth of the HCPL-7800(A). Additional fi  ltering using dif-\nferent fi  lter R,C values in the post-amplifi  er application circuit can be used to improve the signal to noise ratio. For \nexample, by using values of R3 = R4 = 10 kΩ,  C5 = C6 = 470 pF in the application circuit  the rms output noise will be cut roughly by a factor of 2.  In applications needing only a few kHz bandwidth even better noise performance can be obtained. The noise spectral density is roughly 500 nV/√ Hz below 20 kHz (input referred).          \n4.2:  I need 1% tolerance on gain.  Does Avago sell a more precise version?  The HCPL-7800A is gain-trimmed and matched to within ±1% tolerance (at room temperature.)  \n4.3:  Does the gain change if the internal LED light output degrades with time? No.  The LED is used only to transmit a digital patter n. Avago has accounted for LED degradation in the design \nof the product to ensure long life.\n5.  POWER SUPPLIES AND START-UP5.1: What are the output voltages before the input side power supply is turned on? V\nO+ is close to 1.29 V and VO- is close to 3.80 V. This is equivalent to the output response at the condition that LED \nis completely off  .            \n5.2: How long does the HCPL-7840 take to begin working properly after power-up?  Within 1 ms after V\nDD1 and VDD2 powered the device starts to work. But it takes longer time for output to settle down \ncompletely. In case of the off  set measurement while both inputs are tied to ground there is initially VOS adjustment \n(about 60 ms). The output completely settles down in 100 ms after device powering up. \n6.  MISCELLANEOUS6.1:  How does the HCPL-7840 measure negative signals with only a +5 V supply? The inputs have a series resistor for protection against large negative inputs.  Normal signals are no more than 200 \nmV in amplitude.  Such signals do not forward bias any junctions suffi   ciently to interfere with accurate operation \nof the switched capacitor input circuit. \n'}]
