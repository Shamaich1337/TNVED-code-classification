The REF30xx offers excellent \ntemperature drift and initial accuracy while operating \nat a quiescent current of 42 µA (typical).\nThe low power consumption and the relatively high \nprecision make the REF30xx very attractive for loop-\npowered industrial applications such as pressure and \ntemperature transmitter applications. The REF30xx \nis easy to use in intrinsically safe and explosion-\nproof applications because it does not require a load \ncapacitor to be stable. The REF30xx is specified over \nthe extended industrial temperature range of –40°C to \n+125°C.\nThe REF30xx operates with supplies within 1 mV of \noutput voltage under zero-load conditions. Engineers \ncan use the low dropout, small size, and low power \nconsumption of the REF30xx in portable and battery-\npowered applications.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nREF30xx SOT-23 (3) 2.92 mm × 1.30 mm\n \n \n5 Ω\nADS7822VCC\nCS\nDOUT\nDCLOCKVREF\n+In\n–In\nGND++\n1 F to 10 Fμ μ1 F to μ\n10 F μ3.3 V\n0.1 F μ\nVINV+\nVS\nMicrocontrollerREF3033\nGND\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nTypical Application\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0Dropout Voltage (mV)\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nLoad Current (mA)\nDropout Voltage vs Load CurrentREF3012 , REF3020 , REF3025 , REF3030 , REF3033 , REF3040\nSBVS032I  – MARCH 2002 – REVISED JULY 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Its basic topology is shown in the \nSection 8.2 section. Transistors Q 1 and Q 2 are biased so that the current density of Q 1 is greater than that of \nQ2. The difference of the two base-emitter voltages, Vbe 1 – Vbe 2, has a positive temperature coefficient and \nis forced across resistor R 1. This voltage is gained up and added to the base-emitter voltage of Q 2, which \nhas a negative coefficient. The resulting output voltage is virtually independent of temperature. The curvature \nof the bandgap voltage, as shown in Figure 7-3 , is due to the slightly nonlinear temperature coefficient of the \nbase-emitter voltage of Q 2.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nR1\nQ2 Q1+\nVbe1+\nVbe2\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Supply Voltage\nThe REF30xx family of references features an extremely low dropout voltage. With the exception of the \nREF3012, which has a minimum supply requirement of 1.8 V, the REF30xx can be operated with a supply \nof only 1 mV above the output voltage in an unloaded condition. For loaded conditions, a typical dropout voltage \nversus load is shown on the front page.\nThe REF30xx features a low quiescent current that is extremely stable over changes in both temperature and \nsupply. The typical room temperature quiescent current is 42 μA, and the maximum quiescent current over \ntemperature is just 59 μA. Additionally, the quiescent current typically changes less than 2.5 μA over the entire \nsupply range, as shown in Figure 8-1 .\nSupply voltages below the specified levels can cause the REF30xx to momentarily draw currents greater than \nthe typical quiescent current. Use a power supply with a fast rising edge and low output impedance to easily \nprevent this issue.\n42.5\n42.0\n41.5\n41.0\n40.5\n40.0I ( A) μQ\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6\nV (V)IN\nFigure 8-1.

For industrial temperature ranges of –40°C \nto +125°C, the REF30xx family drift increases to a typical value of 50 ppm.\n8.3.4 Noise Performance\nThe REF30xx generates noise less than 50 μVPP between frequencies of 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz, and can be seen \nin Figure 7-20  The noise voltage of the REF30xx increases with output voltage and operating temperature. \nAdditional filtering may be used to improve output noise levels; however, ensure the output impedance does not \ndegrade AC performance.\n8.3.5 Long-Term Stability\nLong-term stability refers to the change of the output voltage of a reference over a period of months or years. \nThis effect lessens as time progresses as is apparent by the long-term stability curves. The typical drift value for \nthe REF30xx is 24 ppm from 0 hours to 1000 hours, and 15 ppm from 1000 hours to 2000 hours. This parameter \nis characterized by measuring 30 units at regular intervals for a period of 2000 hours.\n8.3.6 Load Regulation\nLoad regulation is defined as the change in output voltage as a result of changes in load current. Load regulation \nfor the REF30xx is measured using force and sense contacts as shown in Figure 8-2 . The force and sense lines \ntied to the contact area of the output pin reduce the impact of contact and trace resistance, resulting in accurate \nmeasurement of the load regulation contributed solely by the REF30xx. For applications requiring improved load \nregulation, use force and sense lines.\nOutput Pin\nMeterVOUT+\nSense LineForce Line\nLoadILContact and\nTrace Resistance\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-2.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nFor normal operation, the REF30xx does not require a capacitor on the output. If a capacitive load is connected, \ntake special care when using low equivalent series resistance (ESR) capacitors and high capacitance. This \nprecaution is especially true for low-output voltage devices; therefore, for the REF3012 use a low-ESR \ncapacitance of 10 μF or less. Figure 9-1  shows the typical connections required for operation of the REF30xx. A \nsupply bypass capacitor of 0.47 μF is always recommended.\n1\n3 REF30xx\n20.47 F /c109VIN\nVOUT\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 9-1. Typical Connections for Operating REF30xx\n9.2 Typical Application\nFigure 9-2  shows a low-power reference and conditioning circuit. This circuit attenuates and level-shifts a bipolar \ninput voltage within the proper input range of a single-supply low power 16-Bit ΔΣ ADC, such as the one inside \nthe MSP430  or other similar single-supply ADCs. Precision reference circuits are used to level-shift the input \nsignal, provide the ADC reference voltage and to create a well-regulated supply voltage for the low-power analog \ncircuitry. A low-power, zero-drift, op-amp circuit is used to attenuate and level-shift the input signal.\n+\n+\n±+\n±\nIN OUTREF3012IN OUTREF30303.3 V\nR2\nR11.25 V\n20 k\r\nR3\n3.0 VVOUT20 k\r\nOPA317100 k\r\n10 k\r\n3.0 V 1.25 V3.3 V\nIN+\nIN±SD_16VREFJ1.2/A1+\nJ1.3/A1±\nJ1.5/V REF\n0.625 V\nC2\n47 µFR6\n47 k\r\nR7\n47 k\rVIN\n±5 V\nR4\x08A-ADC\nR53.0 V\nMSP430F2013 \nLaunchpad\n100 k\r\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 9-2.

The ADC is configured for a bipolar measurement where final conversion result is the \ndifferential voltage between the voltage at the positive and negative ADC inputs. The bipolar, GND-referenced \ninput signal must be level-shifted and attenuated by the op amp so that the output is biased to VREF / 2 and has \na differential voltage that is within the ±VREF / 2 input range of the ADC.\n9.2.3 Application Curves\n00.250.50.7511.25\n±6 ±5 ±4 ±3 ±2 ±1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6Output Voltage (V) \nInput Voltage (V) C001 \nFigure 9-3.

These references can be operated \nwith a supply of only 50 mV above the output voltage. For loaded reference conditions, a typical dropout voltage \nversus load is shown in the front page plot, Figure 3-1 . Use a supply bypass capacitor greater than 0.47 µF.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nFigure 11-1  illustrates an example of a printed-circuit board (PCB) layout using the REF30xx. Some key \nconsiderations are:\n•Connect low-ESR, 0.1-μF ceramic bypass capacitors at V IN of the REF30xx\n•Decouple other active devices in the system per the device specifications\n•Use a solid ground plane to help distribute heat and reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise pickup\n•Place the external components as close to the device as possible. This configuration prevents parasitic errors \n(such as the Seebeck effect) from occurring\n•Minimize trace length between the reference and bias connections to the INA and ADC to reduce noise \npickup\n•Do not run sensitive analog traces in parallel with digital traces. Avoid crossing digital and analog traces if \npossible, and only make perpendicular crossings when absolutely necessary\n11.2 Layout Example\nOUT\nGNDIN\nC C\nREF30xxTo ADC To Input Power Supply\nVia to Ground Plane\nFigure 11-1.
