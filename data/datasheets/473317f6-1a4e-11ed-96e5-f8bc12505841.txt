The device integration enables small\ndesigns, while still leaving the ability to adjust key parameters to meet specific design requirements. The\nTPSM41615 provides an output voltage range of 0.6 V to 7.1 V, with a selectable internal reference form 0.6 V to\n1.1 V, for greater accuracy. An external resistor is used to adjust the output voltage to the desired output. The\nswitching frequency is also adjustable by using an external resistor or a synchronization clock to accommodate\nvarious input and output voltage conditions and to optimize efficiency. Applications requiring increased current\ncan benefit from the stackability (parallel outputs and phase-interleaving) of the TPSM41615 device.\nThe TPSM41615 has been designed for safe start-up into pre-biased loads. The EN pin has an internal pullup\ncurrent source that can be used to adjust the input voltage undervoltage lockout (UVLO) with two external\nresistors. In addition, the internal pullup current of the EN pin allows the device to operate with the EN pin\nfloating. The EN pin can also be pulled low to put the device in standby mode to reduce input quiescent current.\nThe device provides a power-good (PGOOD) signal to indicate when the output voltage is within regulation.\nThermal shutdown and current limit features protect the device during an overload condition. A 69-pin QFN\npackage that includes exposed bottom pads provides a thermally-enhanced solution for space-constrained\napplications.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nwww.ti.comTPSM41615\nSLVSEX5A – OCTOBER 2020 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM41615\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Setting the Output Voltage\nThe output voltage adjustment range of the TPSM41615 is 0.6 V to 7.1 V. Setting the output voltage requires first\nsetting the internal reference voltage (V REF). The internal reference voltage can be set from 0.6 V to 1.1 V using\na resistor (R VSEL) connected from VSEL (pin 28) to AGND (pin 19). Table 7-1  lists reference voltage selections\nand their corresponding setting resistors. If the required output voltage is the same as the reference voltage,\nconnect the RS+ pin (pin 35) directly to VOUT to set the output voltage as shown in Figure 7-1 . Output voltages\ngreater than the reference voltage require an external voltage setting resistor (R ADJ) between the RS+ pin and\nVOUT to set the output voltage as shown in Figure 7-2 . The value for R ADJ can be calculated using Equation 1\nor simply selected from the recommended values given in Table 7-2 . Additionally, Table 7-3  includes the\nrecommended switching frequency (F SW), the recommended Ramp resistor (R RAMP ), and the minimum output\ncapacitance for several output voltage ranges.\nRADJ =  (k\r)VrefVOUT1( )\n(1)\nWhen setting the output voltage, selecting the highest reference voltage will result in the most accurate output\nvoltage set point. The output voltage will be regulated at the connection point of RS+ or R ADJ to VOUT. Making\nthe connection near the load improves regulation at the load.\nTable 7-1.

An 1-k Ω\nlower feedback resistor is connected across RS+ and RS– internal to the module. The RS+ pin is used for the\nfeedback connection to VOUT. Connect this pin to the output voltage at the load. This connection can be made\nusing a direct connection or an external upper feedback resistor, depending on the magnitude of VOUT and the\nVSEL selection. The RS- pin is used for the feedback connection to VOUT return. Connect this pin to the output\nvoltage return at the load. The RS- connection is not needed for secondary devices in multi-phase\nconfigurations, and should be left open.\n7.3.3 Ramp Select (RAMP and RAMP_SEL)\nThe RAMP and RAMP_SEL pins set the ramp amplitude for the internal control loop. Internal to the device, a\n78.7-kΩ  resistor is connected between RAMP and RAMP_SEL. Applications requiring 78.7-k Ω ramp setting\nshould connect the RAMP_SEL pin to AGND and leave the RAMP pin open. Applications requiring a larger ramp\nsetting resistor should connect it between the RAMP pin to AGND and leave the RAMP_SEL pin open. The\nrecommended ramp setting resistor can be found in Table 7-3 .\n7.3.4 Switching Frequency (RT)\nThe switching frequency range of the TPSM41615 is 300 kHz to 1 MHz. The switching frequency can easily be\nset by connecting a resistor (R RT) between the RT pin (pin 30) and AGND. Select R RT from Table 7-4  based on\ninput voltage and desired switching frequency.\nThe switching frequency must be selected based on the input voltage and output voltage of the application. See\nTable 7-3  for the allowable switching frequency range for each output voltage.\nTable 7-4.

When synchronizing, the external clock signal\nmust be applied to the SYNC pin before the device reaches its VIN UVLO threshold. In a stand-alone\nconfiguration, the external clock frequency must be within ±20% of the frequency set by the R RT resistor.\nIn stackable configuration: (see Section 7.3.6.1.1  for information on configuring the SYNC pins.)\n1. When there is no external system clock applied, the SYNC pin of the primary device should be configured as\nSync-Out and the SYNC pin of the secondary device should be configured as Sync-In. Connecting the SYNC\npins of the primary and any secondary devices will synchronize all devices to the frequency of the primary.\n2. When an external system clock is applied, the SYNC pin of the primary and secondary device should be\nconfigured as Sync-In and both devices will synchronize to the external system clock.\n7.3.5.1 Loss of Synchronization\nThis device does not support the dynamic application or removal of an external SYNC signal. If the external\nSYNC signal is removed, the device treats this as a clock fault and stops power conversion.\n7.3.6 Stand-alone/Stackable Operation\nThe TPSM41615 can be operated as a single stand-alone device or two devices can be combined to operate\ntogether in a stackable configuration for increased current. These operation modes are selected using a resistor\nconnected from MODE pin to AGND. In stand-alone mode, the resistor value connected to the MODE pin also\nselects whether the transient response feature is ON or OFF (see Table 7-8 ). In stackable mode, the transientTPSM41615\nSLVSEX5A – OCTOBER 2020 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM41615\nresponse feature is not available.

The major limitation for any fixed frequency converter is that\nduring transient load step up, the output voltage drops until the next clock cycle of the converter before it can\nrespond to the load change. The TPSM41615 implements a special circuitry to improve transient performance.\nDuring a load step up, the converter can issue an additional PWM pulse before the next available clock cycle to\nstop output voltage from further dropping, thus reducing the undershoot voltage. The additional pulse during a\ntransient means that the device is not fixed frequency during the transient.\nDuring load step-down, the TPSM41615 implements a body-brake function that turns off both high-side and low-\nside FET, and allows power to dissipate through the low-side body diode, reducing overshoot. This approach is\nvery effective while having some impact on efficiency during transient.\nIn stand-alone mode, choose whether the transient response feature is enabled by placing either a 78.7-k Ω or\n187-kΩ  resistor between the MODE pin and AGND. A 78.7-k Ω MODE resistor is recommended when the output\nvoltage is 0.6 V to 1.8 V or in applications that are more susceptible to noise. Leave the MODE pin open to\noperate in fixed frequency during a load step, (see Table 7-8 ).\nTable 7-8. Stand-Alone Operation Feature Selections\nSTAND-ALONE OPERATION MODE RESISTOR VALUE (kΩ)\nTransient Feature78.7\n187\nFixed Frequency open\n7.3.8 Output On/Off Enable (EN)\nThe EN pin provides electrical ON/OFF control of the device. Once the EN pin voltage exceeds the threshold\nvoltage, the device starts operation. If the EN pin voltage is pulled below the threshold voltage, the regulator\nstops switching and enters low operating current state. The EN pin has an internal pullup to BP5, allowing the\nuser to float the EN pin for enabling the device.\nIf an application requires controlling the EN pin, either drive it directly with a logic input or use an open drain/\ncollector device to interface with the pin. Applying a low voltage to the enable control (EN) pin disables the\noutput of the supply. When the EN pin voltage exceeds the threshold voltage, the supply executes a soft-start\npower-up sequence.\n7.3.9 Power Good (PGOOD)\nThe PGOOD pin is an open-drain output requiring an external pullup resistor to output a high signal. Once the\noutput voltage is between 92% and 108% of the set-point voltage, the PGOOD pin pulldown is released and the\npin floats. A pullup resistor between the values of 10 k Ω and 100 k Ω to a voltage source of 5.5 V or less is\nrecommended. The PGOOD pin is pulled low when the output voltage is lower than 88% or greater than 112% of\nthe set-point voltage.\n7.3.10 Soft-Start Operation\nFor the TPSM41615 device, the soft-start time controls the inrush current required to charge the output\ncapacitors during start-up. When the device is enabled, the output voltage ramps from 0 V to the set-point\nvoltage in the time selected by the SS pin. The device offers 10 selectable soft start options ranging from 0.5 ms\nto 32 ms. See Table 7-9  for details.\nTable 7-9.

In an extended overcurrent condition, the device enters hiccup mode to reduce power\ndissipation. In hiccup mode, the module continues in a cycle of successive shutdown and power up until the load\nfault is removed. During this period, the average current flowing into the fault is significantly reduced, which\nreduces power dissipation. Once the fault is removed, the module automatically recovers and returns to normal\noperation.\n7.3.16 Output Overvoltage and Undervoltage Protection\nThe device includes both output overvoltage protection and output undervoltage protection capability. The\ndevices compare the RS+ pin voltage to internal selectable pre-set voltages. If the RS+ voltage with respect to\nRS- voltage rises above the output overvoltage protection threshold, the device terminates normal switching and\nturns on the low-side MOSFET to discharge the output capacitor and prevent further increases in the output\nvoltage. Then, the device enters continuous restart hiccup.\nIf the RS+ pin voltage falls below the undervoltage protection level, after soft start has completed, the device\nterminates normal switching and forces both the high-side and low-side MOSFETs off, then enters hiccup time-\nout delay prior to restart.\n7.3.17 Overtemperature Protection\nAn internal temperature sensor protects the device from thermal runaway. The internal thermal shutdown\ncircuitry forces the device to stop switching if the junction temperature exceeds 165°C typically. The device\nreinitiates the power-up sequence when the junction temperature drops below 135°C typically.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Active Mode\nThe TPSM41615 is in active mode when VIN is above the UVLO threshold and the EN pin voltage is above the\nEN high threshold. The EN pin has an internal current source to enable the output when the EN pin is left\nfloating. If the EN pin is pulled low the device is put into a low quiescent current state.\n7.4.2 Shutdown Mode\nThe EN pin provides electrical ON and OFF control for the TPSM41615. When the EN pin voltage is below the\nEN low threshold, the device is in shutdown mode. In shutdown mode, the device is put into a low quiescent\ncurrent state. The TPSM41615 also employs undervoltage lockout protection. If V IN is below the UVLO level, the\noutput of the regulator turns off.www.ti.comTPSM41615\nSLVSEX5A – OCTOBER 2020 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM41615\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI\ndoes not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for determining\nsuitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe TPSM41615 is a synchronous step-down DC-DC power module. It is used to convert a higher DC voltage to\na lower DC voltage with a maximum output current of 15 A. The following design procedure can be used to\nselect components for the TPSM41615. Alternately, the WEBENCH® software may be used to generate\ncomplete designs.

Start by entering the input voltage (V IN), output voltage (V OUT), and output current (I OUT) requirements.\n2. Optimize the design for key parameters such as efficiency, footprint, and cost using the optimizer dial.\n3. Compare the generated design with other possible solutions from Texas Instruments.\nThe WEBENCH Power Designer provides a customized schematic along with a list of materials with real-time\npricing and component availability.\nIn most cases, these actions are available:\n• Run electrical simulations to see important waveforms and circuit performance\n• Run thermal simulations to understand board thermal performance\n• Export customized schematic and layout into popular CAD formats\n• Print PDF reports for the design, and share the design with colleagues\nGet more information about WEBENCH tools at www.ti.com/WEBENCH .\n8.2.2.2 Output Voltage Setpoint\nThe output voltage of the TPSM41615 is externally adjustable by first setting the reference voltage, V REF, using\nthe VSEL pin and then, if needed, setting the output voltage adjust resistor R ADJ. For this application, V REF is the\nsame as the output voltage, so R ADJ is not needed and RS+ should be connected to the output rail, near the\nload.\nTo set the output voltage to 0.95 V, select V REF of 0.95 V by connecting a 78.7-k Ω resistor between VSEL pin\nand AGND and connect RS+ pin to the output voltage rail. VSEL resistor values for setting VREF can be found\nin Table 7-1 .\n8.2.2.3 Setting the Switching Frequency\nTo set the switching frequency of the TPSM41615, a resistor (R RT) between the RT pin and AGND is required.\nSelect the value of R RT from Table 7-4 . Before selecting the switching frequency, reference Table 7-3  for the\nallowable switching frequency range, required output capacitance, and RAMP setting for the desired output\nvoltage.\nFor this application, after referencing Table 7-3 , 500 kHz was selected and a 43.2-k Ω RT resistor is required for\na 12-V input according to Table 7-4 .\n8.2.2.4 RAMP Setting\nThe value of the RAMP resistor, R RAMP , must be selected based on the switching frequency and output\ncapacitance of the application, as shown in Table 7-3 . For this application, the required R RAMP  is 78.7 k Ω. There\nis a 78.7-k Ω resistor internal to the device connected between RAMP and RAMP_SEL. To select the internal\n78.7-kΩ resistor, leave the RAMP pin open and connect RAMP_SEL to AGND.\n8.2.2.5 Input Capacitors\nThe TPSM41615 requires a minimum of 88 μF of ceramic input capacitance. Applications with load transient\nrequirements can benefit from adding addition bulk input capacitance.\nFor this design, two 47-μF ceramic capacitors rated for 25 V are used for the input decoupling capacitors.\nAdditionally, a 1-μF bypass capacitor is required on the VIN pin, close to the device pins.\n8.2.2.6 Output Capacitors\nThe minimum required output capacitance for a 12-V input and 0.95-V output at 500 kHz switching frequency is\n294 μ F of ceramic capacitance, as well as an additional 430 μF of either ceramic or low-ESR polymer, as shown\nin Table 7-3 .www.ti.comTPSM41615\nSLVSEX5A – OCTOBER 2020 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM41615\nFor this design, four 100- μF ceramic capacitors plus a 330- μF polymer capacitor where used to meet the\nrequirements.\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 8-2. Output Ripple Waveform\nFigure 8-3. Start-Up Waveforms\nFigure 8-4. 5-A Transient Load Step\n Figure 8-5. 10-A Transient Load Step\n9 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe TPSM41615 is designed to operate from an input voltage supply range between 4 V and 16 V. The input\nsupply must be well regulated and able to withstand maximum input current and maintain a stable voltage. The\nresistance of the input supply rail must be low enough that an input current transient does not cause a high\nenough drop at the TPSM41615 supply voltage that can cause a false UVLO fault triggering and system reset.\nIf the input supply is located more than a few inches from the TPSM41615 additional bulk capacitance can be\nrequired in addition to the ceramic bypass capacitors. Typically, a 47-µF or 100- μF electrolytic capacitor will\nsuffice.TPSM41615\nSLVSEX5A – OCTOBER 2020 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM41615\n10 Layout\nThe performance of any switching power supply depends as much upon the layout of the PCB as the component\nselection. The following guidelines will help users design a PCB with the best power conversion performance,\nthermal performance, and minimized generation of unwanted EMI.\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nTo achieve optimal electrical and thermal performance, an optimized PCB layout is required. Figure 10-1  through\nFigure 10-4  shows a typical PCB layout. Some considerations for an optimized layout are:\n• Use large copper areas for power planes (PVIN, VOUT, and PGND) to minimize conduction loss and thermal\nstress.\n• Place ceramic input and output capacitors close to the device pins to minimize high frequency noise.\n• Locate additional output capacitors between the ceramic capacitor and the load.\n• Keep AGND and PGND separate from one another. The connection is made internal to the device.\n• Place R VSEL, RADJ, RRT, RMODE , and C SS as close as possible to their respective pins.\n• Use multiple vias to connect the power planes (PVIN, VOUT, and PGND) to internal layers.\n10.2 Layout Examples\nFigure 10-1.
