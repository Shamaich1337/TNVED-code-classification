The A port \nis designed to track V CCA. VCCA accepts any supply \nvoltage from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The B port is designed \nto track V CCB. VCCB accepts any supply voltage from \n1.65 V to 5.5 V. This allows for universal low-voltage \nbidirectional translation between any of the 1.8-V, 2.5-\nV, 3.3-V, and 5-V voltage nodes.\nThe SN74LVC2T45  is designed for asynchronous \ncommunication between two data buses. The logic \nlevels of the direction-control (DIR) input activate \neither the B-port outputs or the A-port outputs. The \ndevice transmits data from the A bus to the B bus \nwhen the B-port outputs are activated, and from the \nB bus to the A bus when the A-port outputs are \nactivated. The input circuitry on both A and B ports \nare always active and must have a logic HIGH or \nLOW level applied to prevent excess I CC and I CCZ.\nThe SN74LVC2T45  is designed so that V CCA supplies \nthe DIR input circuit. This device is fully specified \nfor partial-power-down applications using I off. The I off \ncircuitry disables the outputs, preventing damaging \ncurrent backflow through the device when it is \npowered down.\nThe V CC isolation feature ensures that if either V CC \ninput is at GND, both ports are in the high-impedance \nstate.\nPackage Information(1) \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nSN74LVC2T45DCT (SM8, 8) 2.95 mm × 2.80 mm\nDCU (VSSOP, 8) 2.30 mm × 2.00 mm\nYZP (DSBGA, 8) 1.89 mm × 0.89 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.SN74LVC2T45\nSCES516M  – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

V CCA supports pin Ax \nand the direction control pin, and V CCB supports pin Bx. The A port is able to accept I/O voltages ranging from \n1.65 V to 5.5 V, while the B port can accept I/O voltages from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The high on DIR allows data \ntransmission from A to B and a low on DIR allows data transmission from B to A.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nB1DIR5\n7A12\nVCCA VCCBB26A23\nFigure 8-1. Logic Diagram (Positive Logic)\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Fully Configurable Dual-Rail Design Allows Each Port to Operate Over the Full 1.65-V to 5.5-V \nPower-Supply Range\nBoth V CCA and V CCB can be supplied at any voltage between 1.65 V and 5.5 V making the device suitable for \ntranslating between any of the voltage nodes (1.8-V, 2.5-V, 3.3-V, and 5-V).\n8.3.2 Support High-Speed Translation\nSN74LVC2T45  can support high data rate applications. The translated signal data rate can be up to 420 Mbps \nwhen signal is translated from 3.3 V to 5 V.\n8.3.3 Ioff Supports Partial-Power-Down Mode Operation\nIoff will prevent backflow current by disabling I/O output circuits when the device is in Partial-Power-Down mode. \nThe inputs and outputs for this device enter a high-impedance state when the device is powered down, inhibiting \ncurrent backflow into the device. The maximum leakage into or out of any input or output pin on the device is \nspecified by I off in the Electrical Characteristics .\n8.3.4 Balanced High-Drive CMOS Push-Pull Outputs\nA balanced output allows the device to sink and source similar currents. The high drive capability of this device \ncreates fast edges into light loads so impedance matching and load conditions should be considered to prevent \nringing. Additionally, the outputs of this device are capable of driving larger currents than the device can sustain \nwithout being damaged. Two outputs can be connected together for a stronger output drive strength. The \nelectrical and thermal limits defined in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  must be followed at all times.SN74LVC2T45\nSCES516M – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC2T45\n8.3.5 Vcc Isolation\nThe I/O\'s of both ports will enter a high-impedance state when either of the supplies are at GND, while the other \nsupply is still connected to the device.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN74LVC2T45  device can be used in level-translation applications for interfacing devices or systems \noperating at different interface voltages with one another. The maximum data rate can be up to 420 Mbps when \nthe device translates signal from 3.3 V to 5 V. It is recommended to tie all unused I/Os to GND. The device \nshould not have any floating I/Os when changing translation direction.\n9.2 Typical Applications\n9.2.1 Unidirectional Logic Level-Shifting Application\nFigure 9-1  shows an example of the SN74LVC2T45  being used in a unidirectional logic level-shifting application.\nVCC1VCC1 VCC2\nSYSTEM-1 SYSTEM-2VCC11\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5VCC2VCC2\nFigure 9-1.

For a valid logic high, the value must exceed the V IH of the input port. For a valid logic low, \nthe value must be less than the V IL of the input port.\n•Output voltage range\n–Use the supply voltage of the device that the SN74LVC2T45  device is driving to determine the output \nvoltage range. \u2003\n9.2.1.3 Application Curve\nwww.ti.comSN74LVC2T45\nSCES516M – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC2T45\n9.2.2 Bidirectional Logic Level-Shifting Application\nFigure 9-2  shows the SN74LVC2T45  being used in a bidirectional logic level-shifting application.

The bus-line state depends on pullup or \npulldown.(1)\n4 L In Out SYSTEM-2 data to SYSTEM-1\n(1) SYSTEM-1 and SYSTEM-2 must use the same conditions, that is, both pullup or both pulldown.\n9.2.2.2.1 Enable Times\nCalculate the enable times for the SN74LVC2T45  using the following formulas:\n•tPZH (DIR to A) = t PLZ (DIR to B) + t PLH (B to A)\n•tPZL (DIR to A) = t PHZ (DIR to B) + t PHL (B to A)\n•tPZH (DIR to B) = t PLZ (DIR to A) + t PLH (A to B)\n•tPZL (DIR to B) = t PHZ (DIR to A) + t PHL (A to B)\nIn a bidirectional application, these enable times provide the maximum delay from the time the DIR bit is \nswitched until an output is expected. For example, if the SN74LVC2T45  initially is transmitting from A to B, then \nthe DIR bit is switched; the B port of the device must be disabled before presenting it with an input. After the \nB port has been disabled, an input signal applied to it appears on the corresponding A port after the specified \npropagation delay.SN74LVC2T45\nSCES516M – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC2T45\n9.2.2.3 Application Curve\nwww.ti.comSN74LVC2T45\nSCES516M – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC2T45\n10 Power Supply Recommendations\n10.1 Power-Up Considerations\nA proper power-up sequence with inputs held at ground should be followed as listed:\n1.Connect ground before any supply voltage is applied.\n2.Power up V CCA.\n3.VCCB can be ramped up along with or after V CCA.\nThe power supply can be any voltage between the minimum and maximum supply voltage rating located in \nthe Recommended Operating Conditions . The recommendation is to first power-up the input supply rail to help \navoid internal floating while the output supply rail ramps up. However, both power-supply rails can be ramped up \nsimultaneously.\nEach V CC pin must have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. For devices with a single \nsupply, 0.1 µF is recommended. If there are multiple V CC pins, 0.01 µF or 0.022 µF is recommended for each \npower pin. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass capacitors to reject different frequencies of noise. 0.1-µF \nand 1-µF capacitors are commonly used in parallel. The bypass capacitor must be installed as close to the \npower pin as possible for best results.\nTable 10-1.
