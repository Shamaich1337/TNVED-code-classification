Power measured with auxiliary RF output disabled. The current consumption of the auxiliary output is the same as for the \nmain output.  \n4 The synthesizer phase noise floor is estimated by measuring the in- band phase noise at the output of the VCO and subtr acting 20  log N (where N is the N divider \nvalue) and 10  log fPFD. To calculate in -band phase noise performance as seen at the VCO output, use the following formula: PN SYNTH  = PN TOT − 10 log( fPFD) − 20 log N. \n5 The PLL phase noise is composed of flicker (1/f) noise plus the normalized PLL noise floor. The formula for calculating the 1 /f noise contribution at an RF frequency (f RF) \nand at a frequency offset (f) is given by PN  = PN 1_f + 10 log(10 kHz/ f) + 20 log( fRF/1 GHz). Both the normalized phase noise floor and flicker noise are modeled in ADIsimPLL . \n6 fREFIN = 122.88 MHz; f PFD = 30.72 MHz; VCO frequency = 4222.56 MHz; RF OUT = 2111.28 MHz; N = 137; loop BW = 60 kHz ; ICP = 2.5 mA; low noise mode.

When power-down is initiated, SW3 is closed, and SW1 and SW2 are opened. In this way, no loading of the REF\nIN pin \noccurs during power-down. \nBUFFERTO R COUNTER REF IN100kΩ NC\nSW2\nSW3\nNONC\nSW1POWER-DOWN\nCONTROL\n09800-005 \nFigure 16.

RF N Divider \nINT, FRAC, MOD, and R Counter Relationship \nThe INT, FRAC, and MOD values, in conjunction with the \nR counter, make it possible to generate output frequencies that are spaced by fractions of the PFD frequency. For more informa-\ntion, see the RF Synthesizer—A Worked Example section. \nThe RF VCO frequency (RF\nOUT) equation is \nRF OUT = fPFD × (INT + (FRAC /MOD )) (1) \nwhere: \nRF OUT is the output frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator \n(VCO). INT is the preset divide ratio of the binary 16-bit counter (23 to \n65,535 for the 4/5 prescaler; 75 to 65,535 for the 8/9 prescaler). FRAC is the numerator of the fractional division (0 to MOD − 1). \nMOD  is the preset fractional modulus (2 to 4095). \n \n  \n \n The PFD frequency (f\nPFD) equation is \nfPFD = REF IN × [(1 + D)/(R × (1 + T ))] (2) \nwhere: \nREF IN is the reference input frequency. \nD is the REF IN doubler bit (0 or 1). \nR is the preset divide ratio of the binary 10-bit programmable \nreference counter (1 to 1023). T is the REF\nIN divide-by-2 bit (0 or 1). \nInteger-N Mode \nIf FRAC = 0 and the DB8 (LDF) bit in Register 2 is set to 1, the \nsynthesizer operates in integer-N mode. The DB8 bit in Register 2 \nshould be set to 1 for integer-N digital lock detect. \nR Counter \nThe 10-bit R counter allows the input reference frequency \n(REF IN) to be divided down to produce the reference clock  \nto the PFD. Division ratios from 1 to 1023 are allowed. \nPHASE FREQUENCY DETECTOR (PFD) AND \nCHARGE PUMP \nThe phase frequency detector (PFD) takes inputs from the  \nR counter and N counter and produces an output proportional \nto the phase and frequency difference between them. Figure 18 \nis a simplified schematic of the phase frequency detector.  \nU3\nCLR2\nQ2 D2\nU2DOWNUP\nHIGH\nHIGHCPOUT\n–IN+IN\nCHARGE\nPUMPDELAYCLR1Q1 D1\nU1\n09800-007 \nFigure 18. PFD Simplified Schematic \nThe PFD includes a programmable delay element that sets the \nwidth of the antibacklash pulse (ABP). This pulse ensures that \nthere is no dead zone in the PFD transfer function. Bit DB22 in \nRegister 3 (R3) is used to set the ABP as follows: \n\uf0b7 When Bit DB22 is set to 0, the ABP width is programmed to \n6 ns, the recommended value for fractional-N applications. \n\uf0b7 When Bit DB22 is set to 1, the ABP width is programmed to 3 ns, the recommended value for integer-N applications. \nFor integer-N applications, the in-band phase noise is improved \nby enabling the shorter pulse width. The PFD frequency can \noperate up to 90 MHz in this mode. To operate with PFD frequencies higher than 45 MHz, VCO band select must be dis-\nabled by setting the phase adjust bit (DB28) to 1 in Register 1. \nADF4351  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

MUXOUT Schematic  \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER S \nThe ADF4351 digital section includes a 10 -bit RF R counter,  \na 16- bit R F N counter, a 12- bit FRAC counter, and a 12 -bit \nmodulus counter. Data is clocked into the 32 -bit shift register \non each rising edge of CLK. The data is clocked in MSB first. \nData is transferred from the shift register to one of six latches \non the rising e dge of LE. The destination latch is d etermined by \nthe state of the three control bits (C3, C2, and C1) in the shift register. As shown in Figure 2 , the control bits  are the three LSBs:  \nDB2, DB1, and DB0. Table 6 shows t he truth table for these bits . \nFigure 23 summarizes  how the latches are pr ogrammed.  \nTable 6.

Before the part  \nuses a new value for any double -buffered setting, the following \ntwo events must occur:  \n1. The new value is lat ched into the device by writi ng to the \nappropriate register.  \n2. A new write is  performed on Register 0 ( R0). \nFor example, any time that the modulus value is updated, \nRegister  0 (R0) must be written to, to ensure that the modulus \nvalue is loaded correctly. The  divider select value in Register 4 \n(R4) is also double buffered, but only if the DB13 bit of Register  2 (R2) is set to 1 . \nVCO  \nThe VCO core in the ADF4351 consists of three separate VCOs , \neach of which uses 16  overlapping bands, as shown in Figure 20, \nto allow a wide frequency range to be covered without a large \nVCO sensitivity (K V) and resu ltant poor phase noise and spur -\nious performance.  \n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5VTUNE  (V)\nFREQUENCY (GHz)\n09800-120 \nFigure 20. V TUNE  vs. Frequency  \nThe correct VCO and band are selected automatically by the \nVCO and band select logic at power -up or whenever Register 0 \n(R0) is updated.   \nVCO and band selection take 10 PFD cycles multiplied by the value of the band select clock divider. The VCO V\nTUNE is discon -\nnected from the output of the loop filter and is connected to an internal re ference voltage.  \n \n  \n \n \nData Sheet  ADF4351  \n \nRev. A | Page 13 of 28 The R counter output is used as the clock for the band select \nlogic. A programmable divider is provided at the R counter \noutp ut to allow division by an integer from 1 to 255; the divider \nvalue is set using  Bits[ DB19 :DB12 ] in Register 4 (R4). When the \nrequired PFD frequency is higher than 125 kHz, the divide ratio \nshould be set to allow enough time for correct band selection.  \nBand select ion takes 10 cycles of th e PFD  frequency, equal to \n80 µs. If faster lock times are required, B it DB23 in Register 3 \n(R3) must be set to 1 . This setting allows the user to select  a \nhigher band select clock frequency of up to 500 kHz, which speeds up  the minimum band select time to 20 µs.  For phase \nadjustments and small (<1 MHz) frequency adjustments, the user can disable VCO band selection by setting Bit DB28 in \nRegister 1 (R1) to 1. This setting selects the phase adjust feature.  \nAfter band sele ction, normal PLL action resumes. The nominal \nvalue of K\nV is 40 MHz/V when the N  divider is driven from the \nVCO output or from this value divided by D.  D is th e output \ndivider value if the N  divider is driven from the RF divider output  \n(selected  by programming Bits[ DB22:DB20] in Register 4 ). The \nADF4351 contains lineariza tion circuitry to minimize any vari-\nation of the product of I CP and K V to keep the loop bandwidth \nconstant.  \nThe VCO shows variation of K V as the V TUNE varie s within the \nband and from band to  band. For wideband applications cover -\ning a wide frequency range (and changing output dividers) , a \nvalue of 40 MHz/V provides the most accurate K V because  this \nvalue is closest to an average value. Figure 21 shows how K V \nvaries with fundamental VCO frequency , along with an average \nvalue for the frequency band. Users may prefer this figure when using narrow -band designs.  \n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5VCO SENSITIVITY (MHz/V)\nFREQUENCY (GHz)\n09800-121 \nFigure 21. VCO Sensitivity  (KV) vs. Frequency  OUTPUT STAGE  \nThe RF OUTA+ and RF OUTA− pins of the ADF4351 are connected \nto the collectors of an NPN differential pair driven by buffered \noutputs of the VCO, as shown in Figure 22.  \nVCORFOUTA+ RFOUTA–\nBUFFER/\nDIVIDE-BY-1/-2/-4/-8/\n-16/-32/-64\n09800-010 \nFigure 22. Output Stage  \nTo allow the user to optimize the power dissipation vs. the \noutput power requirements, the tail current of the differential pair is programmable using Bits[DB4:DB3] in Register 4 (R4). Four current levels can be set. These lev els give output pow er \nlevels of −4  dBm, −1  dBm, +2  dBm, and +5 dBm, using a 50  Ω \nresistor to AV\nDD and ac coupling into a 50 Ω load. Alternatively, \nboth outputs can be combined in a 1 + 1:1 transformer or a 180° microstrip coupler (see the Output Matching  section).  \nIf the outputs are used individually, the optimum output stage consists of a shunt inductor to V\nVCO. The unused complementary  \noutput must be terminated with a similar circuit to the used output.  \nAn auxiliary output stage ex ists on the RF OUTB+ and RF OUTB− \npins, providing a second set of differential outputs that can be \nused to drive another circuit . The auxiliary output stage can be \nused  only  if the primary outputs are enabled.  If the auxiliary \noutput stage is not used, it can be powered down.  \nAnother fe ature of the ADF4351 is that the supply current to \nthe RF output stage can be shut down until the part achieves lock, as measured by the digital lock detect circuitry. This \nfeature is enabled by setting the mu te till lock detect (MTLD) \nbit in Register 4 (R4).  \n \n \nADF4351  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Register 5 (R5)  \n \n \nADF4351  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. A | Page 18 of 28 REGISTER 0 \nControl Bits  \nWhen Bits[C3:C1] are set to 000, Register 0  is programmed. \nFigure 24 shows the input data for mat for programming this \nregister. \n16- Bit Integer Value  (INT)  \nThe 16 INT bits (Bits[DB30:DB15])  set the INT value, which \ndetermines the i nteger part of the feedback d ivision factor.  The \nINT value  is used in  Equation 1 (s ee the INT, FRAC, MOD, and \nR Counter Relationship  section ). Integer values from 23  to \n65,535 are allowed  for the 4/5 prescaler ; for the 8/9 prescaler, \nthe minimum integer value is 75.  \n12- Bit Fractional Value  (FRAC)  \nThe 12 FRAC bits (Bits[DB14:DB3])  set the numerator of the \nfraction that is input to the Σ -Δ mod ulator. This  fraction , along \nwith the INT  value , specifies the new frequency channel that \nthe synthesizer locks to, as shown in the RF Synthesizer —A \nWorked Example  section. FRAC values from 0 to ( MOD − 1) \ncover channels over a frequency range equal to the PFD refer -\nence frequency.  \nREGISTER  1 \nControl Bits  \nWhen Bits[C3:C1] are set to 001, Register 1  is programmed. \nFigure 25 shows the input data fo rmat for programming this \nregister. \nPhase Adjust  \nThe phase adjust bit  (Bit DB28)  enables  adjust ment of  the output \nphase of a given output frequency . When phase adjustment is \nenabled  (Bit DB28 is set to 1) , the part does n ot perform VCO \nband select ion or ph ase resync when Register 0 is updated . \nWhen phase adjustment is disabled (Bit DB28 is  set to 0 ), the  \npart performs VCO band selection and phase resync (if phase \nresync is enabled in Register 3 , Bits[DB16:DB15] ) when Register 0  \nis updated . Disabling VCO band select ion is recommended only \nfor fixed frequency applications or for frequency deviations of \n<1 MHz from the originally selected frequency.  \nPrescaler Value  \nThe dual -modulus prescaler (P/P + 1), along with the INT, \nFRAC, and MOD values , determines the ov erall division  \nratio from the VCO output  to the PFD input. The PR1 bit \n(DB27) in Register 1  sets the prescaler value.  \nOperating at CML lev els, the prescaler tak es the c lock from the \nVCO output  and divides it down for the counters. The prescaler  \nis based o n a synchronous 4/5 core. When the prescaler is set to \n4/5, the maximum RF frequency allowed is 3.6 GHz. Therefore, \nwhen opera ting the ADF4351 above 3 .6 GHz, the prescaler must  \nbe set to 8/9. The pr escaler lim its the INT value as follows:  \n• Prescaler  = 4/5: NMIN = 23 \n• Prescaler  = 8/9: NMIN = 75 12- Bit Phase Value  \nBits[DB26:DB15] control the phase word. The phase word must \nbe less than the MOD value programmed in Register 1. The phase  \nword is used to program the RF  output phase from 0° to 360 ° \nwith a resolution of 360 °/MOD  (see the Phase Resync  section).  \nIn most appl ications, the phase relationship between the RF \nsignal and the reference is not important. In such applications, the phase value can be used to optimize the fractional and sub -\nfractional spur le vels. For more information,  see the \nSpur \nConsistency and Fractional Spur Optimization  section.  \nIf neither the phase resync nor the spurious optimizati on func -\ntion is used, it is recommended th at the  phase word  be set to 1.  \n12- Bit Modulus Value (MOD)  \nThe 12 MOD  bits (Bits[DB14:DB3])  set the fractional modulus. \nThe fractional modulus  is the ratio of the PFD frequency to the \nchannel step resolution on the RF output. For more inform ation, \nsee the 12-Bit Programmable Modulus  section.  \nREGISTER  2 \nControl Bits  \nWhen Bits[C3:C1] are set  to 010, Register 2  is programmed. \nFigure 26 shows the input data for mat for p rogramming  this \nregister. \nLow Noise and Low Spur Mode s \nThe noise mode on t he ADF4351 is controlled by setting \nBits[DB30: DB29 ] in Register  2 (see Figure 26). The noise mode \nallow s the user to optimize a design either for improved spurious  \nperformance or for improved phase noise pe rformance.  \nWhen the low spur mode  is selected , dither is enabled. Dither  \nrandomizes the fractional quantization noise so  that it rese mbles \nwhit e noise rather than spurious noise. As a result, the part is \noptimized for improved spurious performance. L ow spur mode  \nis normally used for fast -locking applications when the PLL \nclosed -loop bandwidth  is wide . Wide loop ban dwidth is a loop \nbandwidth great er than 1/10 of the RF OUT channel step resolu -\ntion (f RES). A wide loop filter does not att enuate the spurs to the \nsame level as a narrow loop bandwidth.  \nFor best noise performance, use the low noise mode option. \nWhen the low noise mode is selected, dither  is disabled. T his \nmode ensures that the charge pump operates in an optimum \nregion for noise performance. Low noise mode is extremely \nuseful when a narrow loop filter bandwidth is available. The synthesizer ensures extremely low noise, and the filter atten uates  \nthe spurs. Figure 10 through  Figure 12 show  the trade -offs in a \ntypical W -CDMA setup for different noise and spur settings.  \nMUXOUT  \nThe on -chip multiplexer is controlled  by Bits[ DB28: DB26]  \n(see Figure 26). Note that N counter output must be disabled  \nfor VCO band selection to operate correctly.  \n \nData Sheet  ADF4351  \n \nRev. A | Page 19 of 28 Reference Doubler  \nSetting the DB25 bit to 0 disables the doubler and feeds the REF IN \nsignal directly into the 10 -bit R counter. Setting this bit to 1 multi -\nplies the REF IN frequency by a facto r of 2 before feeding it into \nthe 10 -bit R counter. When the doubler is disabled, the REF IN \nfalling edge is the active edge at the PFD input to the fractional \nsynthesizer. When the doubler is enabled, both the rising and \nfalling edges of REF IN become  active edges at the PFD input.  \nWhen the doubler is enabled and the low spur mode is selected , \nthe in- band phase noise performance is sensitive to the REF IN duty  \ncycle. The phase noise degradation can be as much as 5 dB for \nREF IN duty cycles outside a 45% to 55% range. The phase noise \nis insensitive to the REF IN duty cyc le in the low  noise mode and \nwhen the doubler is disabled.  \nThe maximum allowable REF IN frequency when the doubler is \nenabled is 30 MHz.  \nRDIV 2 \nSetting the DB24 bit to 1 inserts a divide -by-2 toggle flip -flop \nbetween the R counter and the PFD , which extends the maximum  \nREF IN input rate. This function allows a 50% duty cycle signal to \nappear at the PFD input, which is necessa ry for cycle slip reduction.  \n10- Bit R Counter  \nThe 10 -bit R counter (Bits[DB23:DB14]) allows the input reference  \nfrequency (R EFIN) to be divided down to produce the reference \nclock to the  PFD . Division ratios from 1 to 1023 are allowed. \nDouble Buffer  \nThe DB13 bit enables or disables double buffering of \nBits[ DB22:DB20] in Register 4. For information about how \ndouble buffering works, see the Program Modes  section.  \nCharge Pump Current Setting  \nBits[ DB12:DB 9] set the charge pump current.  This value should \nbe set to the charge pump current that the loop filter is designed \nwith (see  Figure 26). \nLock Detect Function ( LDF)  \nThe DB8 bit configures the lock detect function (LDF). The LDF controls the number of PFD cycle s monitored by the lock detect \ncircuit to ascertain whether lock has been achieved. When DB8 is  \nset to 0, the number of PFD cycles monitored is 40. When DB8 is set to 1, the number of PFD cycles monitored is 5. It is recom -\nmended that the DB8 bit be set to  0 for fractional -N mode and \nto 1 for integer -N mode.  \nLock Detect Precision (LDP)  \nThe lock detect precision bit (Bit DB7) sets the comparison \nwindow in the lock detect circuit. When DB7 is set to 0, the \ncomparison window is 10  ns; when DB7 is set to 1, the  window \nis 6 ns. The lock detect circuit goes high when n consecutive \nPFD cycles are less than the comparison window value; n is set by the LDF bit (DB8). For example, with DB8 = 0 and DB7 = 0, 40 consecutive PFD cycles of 10 ns or less must occur before  \ndigital lock detect goes high.  For fractional -N applications, the recommended setting for \nBits[DB8:DB7] is 00; f or integer -N applications , the recom -\nmended setting  for Bits[DB8:DB7] is 11. \nPhase Detector Polarity  \nThe DB6 bit sets the phase detector polarity . When a passive \nloop filter or a noninverting active loop filter is used, this bit \nshould be set to 1. If an active filter with an inverting charac -\nteristic is used, this bit  should be set to 0.  \nPower -Down  (PD)  \nThe DB5 bit provides the programmable power -down mode. \nSetting this bit to 1 performs a power -down. Setting this bit to 0 \nreturns the synthesizer to normal operation. I n software power -\ndown mode, the part retains all information in its registers. T he \nregister contents  are lost only if the supply vol tages are removed . \nWhen power -down is activated, the following events occur:  \n• Synthesizer counters are forced to their load state co nditions.  \n• VCO is powered down.  \n• Charge pump is forced into three -state mode.  \n• Digital lock detect circuitry is reset.  \n• RF OUT buffers are disabled . \n• Input register s remain  active and capable of loading and \nlatching data.  \nCharge Pump Three -State  \nSetting the DB4 bit to 1 puts the ch arge pump into three -state \nmode . This bit should be set to 0 for normal operation.  \nCounter Reset  \nThe DB3  bit is the  reset bit for the  R counter and the N counter \nof the ADF4351. When this bit is set to 1, the RF synthesizer \nN counter and R counter are held in reset. For normal opera -\ntion, this bit should be set t o 0. \nREGISTER 3 \nControl Bits  \nWhen Bits[C3:C1] are set  to 011, Register 3  is programmed. \nFigure 27 shows the input data for mat for programming this \nregister. \nBand Select Clock Mode  \nSetting the DB23 bit to 1 selects a faster logic s equence of band \nselect ion, which is  suitable for high PFD frequencies  and is \nnecessary for  fast lock applications. Setting the DB23 bit to 0 is \nrecommended for low PFD (<125 kHz) values. For the faster band select logic modes (DB23 set to 1), the value of the band \nselect clock divider must be less than or equal to 254.  \nAnti backlash Pulse Width  (ABP)  \nBit DB22 sets the PFD antibacklash pulse width. When Bit DB22  \nis set to 0, the PFD anti backlash pulse width is  6 ns.  This setting is \nrecommended for fractional -N use. When Bit DB22 is set to 1, \nthe PFD anti backlash pulse width is  3 ns, which result s in phase \nnoise and spur improvement s in integer -N operation. For \nfractional -N operation, the 3  ns setting  is not recommended.  \nADF4351  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. A | Page 20 of 28 Charge Cancelation  \nSetting the DB21 bit to 1 enables charge p ump charge cancel -\nation. This has the effect of reducing PFD spurs in integer -N \nmode. In fractional -N mode, this bit should be set to 0.  \nCSR Enable  \nSetting the DB18  bit to 1 enables cycle slip reduction. CSR  is  \na me thod for improving lock times . Note that the signal at the \nphase frequency detector (PFD) must have a 50% duty cycle for \ncycle slip reduction to work. The charge pump current se tting \nmust also be set to a minimum. F or more information , see the \nCycle Slip Reduction for Faster Lock Times  section . \nClock Divider Mode  \nBits[ DB16:DB15] must be set to 10 to activate phase resync   \n(see the P hase Resync  section). T hese bits must be set to 0 1  \nto activate fast lock  (see the Fast Lock Timer and Register \nSequences  section ). Setting Bits[ DB16 :DB15] to 00 disables  \nthe clock divider (s ee Figure 27). \n12- Bit Clock Divider Value  \nBits[DB14:DB3]  set the 12 -bit clock divider value. This value  \nis the timeout counter for act ivation of phase resync  (see the \nPhase Resync  section ). The clock divider value also sets the \ntimeout counter for fast lock  (see the Fast Lock Timer and \nRegister Sequences  section) . \nREGISTER  4 \nControl Bits  \nWhen Bits[C3:C1] are set  to 100, Register 4  is programmed. \nFigure 28 shows the input data for mat for programming this \nregister. \nFeedback Select  \nThe DB23 bit selects the feedback from the VCO output to the \nN counter. When this bit is set to 1, the signal is taken directly \nfrom the VCO. When this bit is set to 0, the signal  is taken from \nthe output of the output dividers. The dividers enable cover age \nof the wide frequency band ( 34.375 MHz to 4.4 GHz). When \nthe divider s are enabled and the feedback signal is taken from \nthe output, the RF output signals of two separately configured PLLs are in phase. This is useful in some applic ations where the \npositive interference of signals is required to increase the power.  \nRF Divider Select  \nBits[ DB22:DB20] select the value of the RF output divider (see \nFigure 28).  \nBand Select Clock Divider Value  \nBits[DB19:DB12] set a divider for the band select logic clock input. \nBy default, t he output of the R counter is  the value used to clock \nthe band select logic, but, if this value is too high (>125  kHz), a \ndivider can be switched on to divide the R counter outpu t to a \nsmaller value (see Figure 28).  VCO Power -Down  \nSetting the DB11 bit to 0 powers the VCO  up; setting this bit to 1  \npowers the VCO down . \nMute Til l Lock Detect  (MTLD)  \nWhen  the DB10 bit is set to 1, the supply cu rrent to the RF output  \nstage is shut down until the part achieves lock , as measured by \nthe digital lock detect circuitry.  \nAUX Output Select  \nThe DB9 bit sets the auxiliary RF output. If DB9 is set to 0, the \nauxiliary RF output is the output of the RF divide rs; if DB9 is set \nto 1, the auxiliary RF output is the fundamental VCO frequency.  \nAUX Output Enable  \nThe DB8  bit enables or disables the auxiliary RF output . If DB8 \nis set to 0, the auxiliary RF outpu t is disabled; if DB8 is set to 1, \nthe auxiliary RF outpu t is enabled . \nAUX Output Power  \nBits[ DB7:DB6]  set the valu e of the auxiliary RF output power \nlevel (see Figure 28). \nRF Output Enable  \nThe DB5 bit enables or disables the primary RF output . If DB5 \nis set to 0, the primary RF outpu t is disabled; if DB5 is set to 1, \nthe primary RF outpu t is enabled . \nOutput Power  \nBits[ DB4:DB3] set the value of the primary RF output power \nlevel (see Figure 28). \nREGISTER 5 \nControl Bits  \nWhen Bits[C3:C1] are set  to 10 1, Register 5 i s programmed.  \nFigure 29 shows the input data form at for programming this \nregister. \nLock Detect Pin Operation  \nBits[ DB23:DB22 ] set the o peration of the lock detect  (LD) pin \n(see Figure 29). \nREGISTER INITIALIZATION SEQUE NCE  \nAt initial power -up, after the correct application of voltages to \nthe supply pins, the ADF4351 registers should be started in the \nfollowing sequence:  \n1. Register 5  \n2. Register 4  \n3. Regi ster 3  \n4. Register 2  \n5. Register 1  \n6. Register 0  \n \n \nData Sheet  ADF4351  \n \nRev. A | Page 21 of 28 RF SYNTHESIZER —A WORKED EXAMPLE  \nThe following equations are used to program the ADF4351 \nsynthesizer:  \nRF OUT = [INT + (FRAC /MOD )] × ( fPFD/RF Divider ) (3) \nwhere:  \nRF OUT is the RF frequency output.  \nINT is the integer division factor.  \nFRAC  is the numerator of the fractional division (0 to MOD − 1).  \nMOD  is the preset fractional modulus (2 to 4095).  \nRF Divider  is the output divider that divides down the  \nVCO frequency.  \nfPFD = REF IN × [(1 + D )/(R × (1 + T ))] (4) \nwhere:  \nREF IN is the reference frequency input.  \nD is the RF REF IN doubler bit (0  or 1) . \nR is the RF reference division factor  (1 to 1023) .  \nT is the refe rence divide- by-2 bit (0 or 1).  \nAs an  example, a UMTS system requires  a 2112.6 MHz RF \nfrequency output (RF OUT); a 10 MHz reference frequency input \n(REF IN) is available and a 200 kHz c hannel resolution (f RESOUT ) is \nrequired on the RF output.  \nNote that  the ADF4351 VCO operates in the frequency range  \nof 2.2 GHz to 4.4 GHz. Therefore, the RF divider of 2 should be \nused (VCO frequency  = 4225.2 MHz, RF OUT = VCO frequency/  \nRF divider  = 4225.2 MHz/2  = 2112.6 MHz).  \nIt is also important where the loop is closed. In this example, \nthe loop is closed before the output divider (see Figure 30). \nfPFD\nPFD VCO\nN\nDIVIDER÷2RFOUT\n09800-027 \nFigure 30.

Therefore,  the channel resolution at the output  \nof the VCO ( fRES) needs to be 2 ×  fRESOUT , that is , 400 kHz.  \nMOD  = REF IN/fRES \nMOD  = 10 MHz /400 kHz = 25 \nFrom Equation 4,  \nfPFD = [10 MHz × (1 + 0 )/1] = 10 MHz  (5) \n2112.6 MHz  = 10 MHz ×  [(INT + (FRAC /25))/2]  (6) \nwhere:  \nINT = 422. \nFRAC  = 13. \n \n \n REFERENCE DOUBLER AN D REFERENCE DIVIDER  \nThe on -chip reference doubler allows the input reference si gnal \nto be doubled. Doubling the reference signal doubles the PFD \ncomparison frequency, which improves the noise performance of  \nthe system. Doubling the PFD frequency usually improves noise \nperformance by 3 dB. N ote that in fractional -N mode , the PFD  \ncanno t operate  above 32 MHz due to a limitation in the sp eed \nof the Σ -Δ circuit of the N  divider.  For integer -N applications, \nthe PFD can operate up to 90 MHz.  \nThe reference divide- by-2 divides the reference signal by 2, \nresulting in a 50% duty cycle PFD freque ncy. This is necessary \nfor the correct operation of the cycle slip reduction (CSR) function. For more information , see the Cycle Slip Reduction \nfor Faster Lock Times  section.  \n12-BIT PROGRAMMABLE MOD ULUS  \nThe choice of modulus (MOD)  depends on the reference signal \n(REF IN) available and the channel resolution (f RES) required at the  \nRF ou tput. For example, a GSM system with 13 MHz REF IN sets \nthe modulus to 65. This means th at th e RF output resolution \n(fRES) is the 200 kHz (13 MHz/65) n ecessary for GSM. With \ndither off, the fractional spur interval depends on the selected  \nmodulus values (see Table 7). \nUnlike most other fractional -N PLLs, the ADF4351 allows the \nuser to program the modulus over a 12 -bit range. W hen com -\nbined with the reference do ubler and the 10- bit R counter, the \n12-bit modulus allows the user to set up the part in many \ndifferent configurations for the application.  \nFor example , conside r an application that requires a 1.75 GHz \nRF frequency output with a 200 kHz channel step resolution. \nThe system has a 13 MHz reference signal.  \nOne possible setup  is to feed the 13 MHz reference signal \ndirectly into the PFD and to program  the modulus to di vide  \nby 65. This results in the required 200 kHz resolution.  \nAnother possible setup is to use  the reference doubler to create \n26 MHz from the 13 MHz input signal. The  26 MHz is then fed \ninto the PFD , and the modulus is programmed to divide by 130. \nThis se tup also results in 200 kHz resolution but  offers superior \nphase noise performance over the first  setup.  \nThe programmable modulus is also very useful fo r multi -\nstandard applications. For example, i f a dual -mode phone \nrequires PDC and GSM 1800 standards, th e programmable \nmodulus is of great benefit.  \nPDC requires 25 kHz channel step resolution, whereas GSM  1800 \nrequires 200 kHz channel step resolution. A 13 MHz reference signal can be fed directly to the PFD, and the modulus can be \nprogrammed to 520 when in P DC mode (13 MHz/520 = 25 kHz).  \nThe modulus must be reprogrammed to 65 for GSM 1800 opera -\ntion (13 MHz/65 = 200 kHz).  \n \n \nADF4351  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. A | Page 22 of 28 It is important that the PFD frequency remain constant ( in this \nexample, 13 MHz). This allows the user to design one loop filter \nfor both  setups without encountering stability issues. Note that \nthe ratio of the RF frequency to the PFD frequency principally \naffects the loop filter design, not the actual channel spacing.  \nCYCLE SLIP REDUCTION  FOR FASTER LOCK TIME S \nAs described in the Low Noise and Low Spur Modes  section, the \nADF4351 contains a number of features that allow optimization  \nfor noise performance. However, in fast -locking applications, \nthe loop b andwidth generally needs to be wide and, therefore, \nthe filter does not provide much attenuation of the spurs. If the cycle slip reduction feature i s enabled, the narrow loop band -\nwidth is maintained for spur attenuation, but faster lock times are still po ssible. \nCycle Slips  \nCycle slips occur in integer -N/fractional -N synthesizers when \nthe loop bandwidth is narrow compared to the PFD frequency. The phase error at the PFD inputs accumulates too fast for the PLL to correct, and the charge pump temporarily pum ps in the \nwrong direction. This slows down the lock time dramatically. The ADF4351 contains a cycle slip reduction feature that \nextends the linear range of the PFD, allowing faster lock times without modifications to the loop filter circuitry.  \nWhen the circuitry  detects that a cycle slip is about to occur, it \nturns on an extra charge pump current cell. This cell outputs a constant cu rrent to the loop filter or removes a constant current \nfrom the loop filter (de pending on whether the VCO tuning \nvoltage needs to increase or decrease to acquire the new frequency). The effect is that the linear range of the PFD is increased. Loop s tability is maintained because the current is \nconstant and is not a pulsed current.  \nIf the phase error increases again to a point where another cycle \nslip is likely, the ADF4351 turns on another charge pump cell. \nThis continues until the ADF4351 detects that the VCO fre -\nquency has exceeded  the desired frequency. The extra charge \npump cells are turned off one by one until all the extra charge pump cells are disabled and the frequency settles to  the original \nloop filter bandwidth.  \nUp to seven extra ch arge pump cells can be turned on. In most \napplications, seven  cells are enough to eliminate cycle slips \naltogether, providing  much faster lock times.  \nSetting Bit DB18 in Register 3 to 1 enables cycle slip reduction. Note that the PFD requires a 45% to 55% dut y cycle f or CSR to \noperate correctly. If the REF\nIN frequency does not have a suitable \nduty cycle, enabling the RDIV2 mode (Bit DB24 in Register 2) ensures that the input to the PFD has a 50 % dut y cycle.  \n \n \n SPURIOUS OPTIMIZATIO N AND FAST LOCK \nNarrow loop  bandwidths  can filter unwanted s purious signals, \nbut these  bandwidths usually have a long lock time. A wider \nloop bandwidth achieve s faster lock times but may lead to \nincreased spurious signals inside the loop bandwidth.  \nThe fast lock feature can achieve the same fast lo ck time as the \nwider bandwidth but with the advantage of a narrow final loop \nbandwidth to keep spurs low.  \nFAST LOCK TIMER AND REGIS TER SEQUENCES  \nIf the fast lo ck mode is used, a timer value must be loaded into \nthe PLL to determine the durat ion of the wide bandwidth mode.  \nWhen Bits[DB16:DB15] in Register 3 are set to 01 (fast lock \nenable) , the timer value is loaded by  the 12 -bit clock divider \nvalue (Bits[DB14:DB3] in Register 3) . The following sequence  \nmust be programmed to use fast lock : \n1. Start the initialization sequence (see the Register Initialization \nSequence  section) . This sequence  occurs only once after \npowering up the part.  \n2. Load Register 3 by setting Bits[DB16:DB15] to 01 and by \nsetting the selected fast lo ck timer value (Bits [DB14:DB3] ). \nThe duration that the PLL remains in wide bandwidth mode  \nis equal to the fast lo ck timer/f PFD. \nFAST LOCK EXAMPLE  \nIf a PLL has a reference frequency of 13 MHz, f PFD of 13  MHz, \nand a required lock time of 60 µs, the PLL is set to wide band width  \nmode for 20 µs. This example assumes a modulus of 65 for channel  \nspacing of 200 kHz. The VCO calibration time of 20  µs must also  \nbe taken into account (achieved by programming the higher band  \nselect clock mode using Bit DB23  of Register 3).  \nIf the time set for the PLL lock time in wide bandwidth mode is \n20 µs, then  \nFast Lock Timer Value  = (VCO Band Select T ime +  \nPLL Lock Time  in Wide Bandwidth ) × fPFD/MOD  \nFast Lock Timer Value  = (20 µs + 20 µs) × 13 MHz /65 = 8 \nTherefore, a value of 8 m ust be loaded into the clock divider \nvalue in  Register  3 (see  Step 2 in the Fast Lock Timer and \nRegister Sequences  section ). \nData Sheet ADF4351\n \nRev. A | Page 23 of 28 FAST LOCK LOOP FILTER TOPOLOGY \nTo use fast lock mode, the damping resistor in the loop filter is \nreduced to one-fourth its value while in wide bandwidth mode. \nTo achieve the wider loop filter bandwidth, the charge pump current increases by a factor of 16; to maintain loop stability,  \nthe damping resistor must be reduced by a factor of one-fourth. \nTo enable fast lock, the SW pin is shorted to the AGND pin by setting Bits[DB16:DB15] in Register 3 to 01. The following two \ntopologies are available: \n\uf0b7 The damping resistor (R1) is divided into two values  \n(R1 and R1A) that have a ratio of 1:3 (see Figure 31). \n\uf0b7 An extra resistor (R1A) is connected directly from SW , as shown in Figure 32. The extra resistor is calculated such \nthat the parallel combination of the extra resistor and the \ndamping resistor (R1) is reduced to one-fourth the original value of R1 (see Figure 32). \nADF4351\nCPOUT\nSWC1 C2R2\nR1\nR1AC3VCO\n09800-018 \nFigure 31.

Fast Lock Loop Filter Topology 2 \nSPUR MECHANISMS \nThis section describes the three different spur mechanisms that \narise with a fractional-N synthesizer and how to minimize them \nin the ADF4351 . \nFractional Spurs \nThe fractional interpolator in the ADF4351  is a third-order  \nΣ-Δ modulator with a modulus (MOD) that is programmable  \nto any integer value from 2 to 4095. In low spur mode (dither on), the minimum allowable value of MOD is 50. The Σ-Δ \nmodulator is clocked at the PFD reference rate (f\nPFD), which \nallows PLL output frequencies to be synthesized at a channel \nstep resolution of f PFD/MOD. \n \n In low noise mode (dither off), the quantization noise from the \nΣ-Δ modulator appears as fractional spurs. The interval between spurs is f\nPFD/L, where L is the repeat length of the code sequence \nin the digital Σ-Δ modulator. For the third-order Σ-Δ modulator \nused in the ADF4351, the repeat length depends on the value of \nMOD (see Table 7). \nTable 7. Fractional Spurs with  Dither Off (Low Noise Mode) \nMOD Value (Dither Off) Repeat \nLength Spur Interval \nMOD is divisible by 2, but not by 3 2 × MOD Channel step/2 \nMOD is divisible by 3, but not by 2 3 × MOD Channel step/3 \nMOD is divisible by 6 6 × MOD Channel step/6 \nMOD is not divisible by 2, 3, or 6 MOD Channel step \nIn low spur mode (dither on), the repeat length is extended  \nto 221 cycles, regardless of the value of MOD, which makes the \nquantization error spectrum look like broadband noise. This may degrade the in-band phase noise at the PLL output by as \nmuch as 10 dB. For lowest noise, dither off is a better choice, \nparticularly when the final loop bandwidth is low enough to \nattenuate even the lowest frequency fractional spur. \nInteger Boundary Spurs \nAnother mechanism for fractional spur creation is the inter-\nactions between the RF VCO frequency and the reference \nfrequency. When these frequencies are not integer related (the \npurpose of a fractional-N synthesizer), spur sidebands appear on the VCO output spectrum at an offset frequency that corre-sponds to the beat note, or difference frequency, between an integer multiple of the reference and the VCO frequency. These \nspurs are attenuated by the loop filter and are more noticeable \non channels close to integer multiples of the reference, where the difference frequency can be inside the loop bandwidth (thus \nthe name integer boundary spurs). \nReference Spurs \nReference spurs are generally not a problem in fractional-N \nsynthesizers because the reference offset is far outside the loop \nbandwidth. However, any reference feedthrough mechanism that bypasses the loop may cause a problem. Feedthrough of low levels of on-chip reference switching noise, coupling to the \nVCO, can result in reference spur levels as high as −80 dBc. The \nPCB layout must ensure adequate isolation between VCO circuitry and the input reference to avoid a possible feedthrough path on \nthe board. \n   \n \nADF4351  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. A | Page 24 of 28 SPUR CONSISTENCY AND  FRACTIONAL SPUR \nOPTIMIZATION  \nWith dither off, the fractional spur pattern due to the quantiz a-\ntion noise of the Σ -Δ modulator also depends on the particular \nphase word with which the modulator is seeded.  \nThe phase word can be varied to optimize the fractional and \nsubfractional spur levels on any par ticular frequency. Thus, a \nlook up table of phase values corresponding to each frequency \ncan be c reated for use when programming the ADF4351. \nIf a look up table is not used, keep the phase word at a co nstant \nvalue to ensure consistent spur level s on any particular frequency.  \nPHASE RESYNC  \nThe output of a fractional -N PLL can settle to any one of the \nMOD phase offsets with respect to the input reference, where MOD is the fractional modulus. The phase resync feature of  \nthe ADF4351 produces a consistent output phase offset with \nrespect to the input reference. This phase offset is necessary in applic ations where the output phase and frequency are important,  \nsuch as digital beamforming. See the P hase  Programmability  \nsection to program a specific RF output phase when u sing \nphase resync.  \nPhase resyn c is enabled by setting Bits[DB16:DB15] in \nRegister  3 to 10. When phase resync is enabled, an inte rnal \ntimer generates s ync signals at intervals of t\nSYNC given by the \nfollowing formula:  \ntSYNC = CLK_DIV_VALUE  × MOD × tPFD \nwhere:  \nCLK_DIV_VALUE  is the decim al value programmed in \nBits[DB14:DB3 ] of Register  3. This value  can be any integer \nfrom  1 to 4095.  \nMOD  is the modulus valu e programmed in Bits[DB 14:DB3]  \nof Register  1 (R1).  \ntPFD is the PFD reference period.  \nWhen a new frequency is programmed, the second sync pulse after the LE rising edge is used to resynchronize the output phase to the reference. The t\nSYNC time must  be prog rammed to  \na value that is a t least as long as the worst -case lock time. This \nguarantees th at th e phase resync occurs after the last cycle slip  \nin the PLL settling transient.  \n \n \n In the example shown in Figure 33,  the PFD reference is 25  MHz  \nand MOD  = 125 for a 200 kHz channel spacing. t SYNC is set to \n400 µs by programming CLK_DIV_V ALUE  = 80. \nLE\nPHASEFREQUENCYSYNC\n(INTERNAL)\n–100 0 100 200 1000 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\nTIME (µs)PLL SETTLES TO\nCORRECT PHASE\nAFTER RESYNCtSYNC\nLAST CYCLE SLIP\nPLL SETTLES TO\nINCORRECT PHASE\n09800-020 \nFigure 33. Phase Resync Example  \nPhase  Programmability  \nThe phase word in Register 1 controls the R F output phase. As \nthis word is swept from 0 to MOD, the RF output phase sweeps \nover a 360° range in steps of 360°/MOD.  In many applications, \nit is advisable to disable VCO band selec tion by setting Bit DB28 \nin Register 1  (R1)  to 1. This setting selects th e phase adjust feature.  \nHigh PFD Frequencies  \nVCO band select ion is required to ensure that the correct VCO \nband is chosen for the relevant frequency. VCO band select ion \ncan operat e with PFD frequencies up to 45  MHz using the high \nVCO band select mode ( set Bit DB23  in Register 3  to 1). \nFor PFD frequencies  higher  than 45 MHz , it is recommended \nthat the user perform the following steps:  \n1. Program the desired VCO frequency with phase adjust ment  \ndisabled  (set Bit DB28  in Register 1  to 0). Ensure that the \nPFD frequ ency  is less than 45  MHz.  \n2. After  the correct frequency is  achieved, enable  phase adjust -\nment  (set Bit DB28  in Register 1  to 1).  \n3. PFD frequencies higher than 32  MHz are permissible only \nwith integer -N applications; therefore, set the antibacklash \npulse width  to 3 ns (set Bit DB22 in Register 3  to 1).  \n4. Using the desired PFD frequency , program the a ppropriate \nvalues for the r eference R  and feedback N counters.  \nUsing this procedure , the lowest rms in -band phase noise can \nbe achieved.  \n \n \nData Sheet  ADF4351  \n \nRev.

Figure 34 shows how \nAnalog Devices, Inc., parts can be u sed to implement such a \nsyste m. \nFigure 34 shows the AD9788 TxDAC® used with the ADL5375. \nThe use of dual int egrated DACs, such as the AD9788 with i ts \nspecified ± 2% FSR and ±0.001%  FSR gain and offset character -\nistics, ensures minimum error contr ibution (over temperature) \nfrom this portion of the signal chain.  \nThe local oscillator (LO) is implemented using the ADF4351. The  \nlow-pass filter was designed using ADIsimPLL ™ for a channel \nspacing of 200 kHz and a closed -loop bandwidth of 35 kHz.  The LO ports of the ADL5375 can be driven differentially from \nthe complementary RF OUTA± outputs of the ADF4351. This setup  \nprovides  better performance than a single- ended LO driver and \nelimina tes the use of a balun to convert from a single -ended LO \ninput to the more desirable differential LO input for the ADL5375 . \nThe typical rms phase noise (100 Hz to 5  MHz) of the LO in this  \nconfiguration is 0.61°  rms.  \nThe ADL5375 accepts LO drive levels from − 6 dBm to +6  dBm. \nThe optimum LO power can be soft ware programmed on the \nADF4351, which allows levels from −4 dBm to +5 dBm from \neach output.  \nThe RF output is designed to drive a 50 Ω load , but it must be \nac-coupled, as shown in Figure 34. If the I and Q inputs are \ndriven in quadrature by 2 V p -p signals, the resulting output \npower from the ADL5375 modulator is approximately 2 dBm.  \n \n09800-034AD9788\nTxDACMODULATED\nDIGITAL\nDATA\nOUT2_NOUT1_P\nOUT1_N\nOUT2_PLOW-PASS\nFILTER\nLOW-PASS\nFILTER\n2700pF 1200pF39nF680Ω\n360ΩIBBP\nIBBN\nQBBP\nQBBNLOIP\nLOINSPI-COMPATIBLE SERIAL BUSADF4351VVCOVVCO\nCPGND AGND DGNDRFOUTB–RFOUTB+\nCPOUT1nF 1nF\n4.7kΩRSETLEDATACLKREFIN fREFIN\nVTUNEDVDDAVDD CE MUXOUT10 28 16\n29\n1\n2\n3\n22\n8 31 9 1118 21 27VDDLOCK\nDETECT\n51Ω51Ω 51Ω\n51Ω 51Ω\nAGNDVCO14\n15\n19 23 2425 30\nLD17\n20\n7PDBRF26\nSDGND TEMP VCOM VREF6 32\nSDVDD VP\n5 SW\n10pF 0.1µF10pF 0.1µF10pF 0.1µF4\nADL5375\nRFOUTQUADRATURE\nPHASE\nSPLITTER\nDSOPRFOUTA–RFOUTA+\n1312\n1nF1nF3.9nH 3.9nHVVCO\nLPF\nLPF\n \nFigure 34.

A | Page 26 of 28 INTERFACING TO THE ADuC70xx  AND \nTHE ADSP-BF527 \nThe ADF4351  has a simple SPI-compatible serial interface for \nwriting to the device. The CLK, DATA, and LE pins control the \ndata transfer. When LE goes high, the 32 bits that were clocked \ninto the appropriate register on each rising edge of CLK are \ntransferred to the appropriate latch. See Figure 2 for the timing \ndiagram and Table 6 for the register address table. \nADuC70xx Interface \nFigure 35 shows the interface between the ADF4351  and the \nADuC70xx  family of analog microcontrollers. The ADuC70xx  \nfamily is based on an AMR7 core, but the same interface can be \nused with any 8051-based microcontroller. \nADuC70xx ADF4351\nCLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)SCLOCK\nMOSI\nI/O PORTS\n09800-035 \nFigure 35. ADuC70xx  to ADF4351  Interface \nThe microcontroller is set up for SPI master mode with CPHA = \n0. To initiate the operation, the I/O port driving LE is brought low. Each latch of the ADF4351  needs a 32-bit word, which is \naccomplished by writing four 8-bit bytes from the micro-controller to the device. After the fourth byte is written, the  LE input should be brought high to complete the transfer. \nWhen power is first applied to the ADF4351 , the part requires \nsix writes (one each to R5, R4, R3, R2, R1, and R0) for the output \nto become active. \nI/O port lines on the microcontroller are also used to control \nthe power-down input (CE) and to detect lock (MUXOUT \nconfigured as lock detect and polled by the port input).  \nWhen operating in the mode described, the maximum SPI \ntransfer rate of the ADuC70xx  is 20 Mbps. This means that  \nthe maximum rate at which the output frequency can be \nchanged is 833 kHz. If using a faster SPI clock, make sure that \nthe SPI timing requirements listed in Table 2 are adhered to. \n ADSP-BF527 Interface \nFigure 36 shows the interface between the ADF4351  and the \nBlackfin® ADSP-BF527  digital signal processor (DSP). The \nADF4351  needs a 32-bit serial word for each latch write. The \neasiest way to accomplish this using the Blackfin family is to  \nuse the autobuffered transmit mode of operation with alternate framing. This mode provides a means for transmitting an entire \nblock of serial data before an interrupt is generated. \nADSP-BF527 ADF4351\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)I/O PORTSCLK SCK\nDATA MOSI\nLE GPIO\n09800-036 \nFigure 36.

To program each 32-bit latch, \nstore the four 8-bit bytes, enable the autobuffered mode, and \nwrite to the transmit register of the DSP . This last operation initiates the autobuffer transfer. Make sure that the SPI timing \nrequirements listed in Table 2 are adhered to. \nPCB DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR A CHIP SCALE \nPACKAGE \nThe lands on the chip scale package (CP-32-7) are rectangular. \nThe PCB pad for these lands must be 0.1 mm longer than the \npackage land length and 0.05 mm wider than the package land \nwidth. Each land must be centered on the pad to ensure that the \nsolder joint size is maximized. \nThe bottom of the chip scale package has a central exposed thermal \npad. The thermal pad on the PCB must be at least as large as the exposed pad. On the PCB, there must be a minimum clearance of 0.25 mm between the thermal pad and the inner edges of the pad pattern to ensure that shorting is avoided. \nThermal vias can be used on the PCB thermal pad to improve \nthe thermal performance of the package. If vias are used, they \nmust be incorporated into the thermal pad at 1.2 mm pitch grid. The via diameter must be between 0.3 mm and 0.33 mm, and \nthe via barrel must be plated with 1 oz. of copper to plug the via. \nData Sheet  ADF4351  \n \nRev.
