Typical Application Schematic\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nThis device uses CMOS technology and has balanced output drive. Take care to avoid bus contention because \nit can drive currents that would exceed maximum limits. The high drive will also create fast edges into light loads \nso routing and load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing.www.ti.comSN54HC595, SN74HC595\nSCLS041J – DECEMBER 1982 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: SN54HC595  SN74HC595\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n•Recommended input conditions\n–Specified high and low levels.

For devices with a single \nsupply, 0.1 μf is recommended; if there are multiple V CC pins, then 0.01 μf or 0.022 μf is recommended for each \npower pin. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass caps to reject different frequencies of noise. A 0.1 μf and \na 1 μf are commonly used in parallel. The bypass capacitor should be installed as close to the power pin as \npossible for best results.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple-bit logic devices, inputs should never float.\nIn many cases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused, for example, when only two \ninputs of a triple-input AND gate are used or only 3 of the 4 buffer gates are used. Such input pins should not \nbe left unconnected because the undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational \nstates. Figure 11-1  specifies the rules that must be observed under all circumstances. All unused inputs of digital \nlogic devices must be connected to a high or low bias to prevent them from floating. The logic level that should \nbe applied to any particular unused input depends on the function of the device. Generally they will be tied to \nGND or V CC, whichever makes more sense or is more convenient. It is generally acceptable to float outputs, \nunless the part is a transceiver. If the transceiver has an output enable pin, it will disable the output section of the \npart when asserted. This will not disable the input section of the I/Os, so they cannot float when disabled.\n11.2 Layout Example\nVcc\nUnused Input\nInputOutputInput\nUnused Input Output\nFigure 11-1.

Texas Instruments recommends that all integrated circuits be handled \nwith appropriate precautions. Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures can cause damage.\nESD damage can range from subtle performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision integrated circuits may \nbe more susceptible to damage because very small parametric changes could cause the device not to meet its published \nspecifications.\n12.5 Glossary\nTI Glossary This glossary lists and explains terms, acronyms, and definitions.\n13 Mechanical, Packaging, and Orderable Information\nThe following pages include mechanical packaging and orderable information.

#### Description:
The SN74HC595 is an 8-bit shift register with serial input and parallel output capabilities. It features a storage register with 3-state outputs, allowing for flexible data handling in digital circuits. The device operates with separate clocks for the shift and storage registers, enabling efficient data transfer and manipulation. The shift register includes a direct clear input, which allows for immediate resetting of the register contents.

#### Typical Applications:
The SN74HC595 is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Network Switches**: For managing data flow and control signals.
- **Power Infrastructure**: In systems requiring reliable data handling and control.
- **LED Displays**: For driving multiple LEDs with minimal pin usage.
- **Servers**: In data communication and control applications where efficient data handling is crucial.

This component is particularly useful in applications where space is limited, and multiple outputs are needed from a single input source, making it ideal for cascading configurations in larger systems.
