This multiformat decoder supports  \nthe conversion of PAL, NTSC, and SECAM standards in the \nform of composi te or S -Video into a digital ITU -R BT.656 format . \nThe ADV7403 also supports the decoding of a component \nRGB/YPrPb video signal into a digital YCrCb or RGB pixel output  \nstream. The support for c omponent video includes standards \nsuch as 525i, 625i, 525p, 625p, 720p, 1080i, 1250i, and many other HD and SMPTE standards. Graphic digitization is also \nsupported by the ADV7403; it is capable  of digitizing RGB \ngraphics signals from VGA to SXGA rates and converting them \ninto a digital RGB or YCrCb pixel output stream. SCART and overlay functionality are enabled by the ability of the ADV7403 \nto simultaneously process CVBS and standard definition RGB signals. The fast blank pin controls the mixing of these signals.  \nThe ADV7403 contains two main processing sections. The first \nis the standard definition processor (SDP), which processes all PAL, NTSC, and SECAM signal types, and t he second is the \ncomponent processor (CP), which processes YPrPb and RGB component formats, including RGB graphics. For additional  \ndescriptions of the  features of the  ADV7403, see the Functional \nOverview  and the Theory of Operation  sections.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Rev.

B | Page 11 of 20  \nADV7403  Data Sheet  \n \nFUNCTIONAL  OVERVIEW  \nThe following overview provides a brief description of the \nfunctionality of the ADV7403. More details are available in the \nTheory of Operation  section.  \nANALOG FRONT END  \nThe analog front end of the ADV7403 provides four 140 MHz \n(ADV7403KSTZ -140), NSV , 1 2-bit ADCs to enable 10 -bit video \ndecoding, a multiplexer with 12 analog input channels to enable \nmultisource connection without the requirement of an external multiplexer, and four current and voltage clamp control loops to \nensure that dc offsets are removed from the video signal. \nSCART functionality and standard definition RGB overlay with \nCVBS are controlled by the fast blank  input.  This front end  also \nfeatures four antialias filters to remove out -of-band noise on \nstandard definition input video signals.  \nSTANDARD DEFINITION PROCESSOR  (SDP) PIXEL \nDATA OUTPUT MODES  \nThe ADV7403 features the following SDP  output modes:  \n• 8-/10-bit ITU -R BT.656 4:2:2 YCrCb with embedded time \ncodes and/or HS, VS, and FIELD  \n• 16-/20-bit YCrCb with embedded time codes and/or HS, \nVS, and FIELD  \n• 24-/30-bit YCrCb with embedded time codes and/or HS, \nVS, and FIELD  \nCOMPONENT PROCESSOR  (CP) PIXEL DATA \nOUTPUT MODES  \nThe ADV7403 features two single data rate (SDR)  outputs:  \n16-/20-bit 4:2:2 YCrCb for all standards, and 24 -/30-bit 4:4:4 \nYCrCb/RGB for all standards . The ADV7403 also features two \ndouble data rate (DDR) outputs : 8-/10-bit 4:2:2 YCrCb for all \nstandards , and 12- bit 4:4:4 YCrCb/RGB for all standards. \nCOMPOSITE AND S -VIDEO PROCESSING  \nThe ADV7403 supports NTSC ( J, M, 4.43), PAL (B, D, I, G, H, \nM, N, Nc, 60), and SECAM (B, D, G, K, L) standards for CVBS and S -Video formats. Superadaptive 2D, 5 -line comb filters for \nNTSC and PAL provide superior chromin ance and luminance \nseparation for composite video.  \nThe composite and S -Video processing functionalities also \ninclude fully automatic detection of switching among worldwide  \nstandards (PAL/NTSC/SECAM); automatic gain control (AGC) \nwith white peak mode to en sure that the video is processed \nwithout compromising the video processing range; adaptive digital line length tracking  (ADLLT™); and proprietary architecture \nfor locking to weak, noisy, and unstable sources from VCRs and tuners. The IF filter block compen sates for high frequency luma \nattenuation due to the tuner SAW filter.  \n \n The ADV7403 also features chroma transient improvement \n(CTI) and luminance digital noise reduction (DNR), as well as \nteletext, closed captioning (CC), extended data service (EDS), \nand wide -screen signaling (WSS). It offers certified Macrovision® \ncopy protection detection on composite and S -Video for all \nworldwide formats (PAL/NTSC/SECAM), and a copy generation management sy stem (CGMS). Other features \ninclude 4× oversampling (54 MHz) for CVBS, S -Video, and \nYUV modes; line -locked clock output (LLC); vertical interval \ntime codes (VITC); support for letterbox detection; a free- run \noutput mode for stable timing when no video inpu t is present; \nclocking from a single 28.63636 MHz crystal; Gemstar™ 1×/2× electronic program guide compatible; and subcarrier frequency lock (SFL) output for downstream video encoders.  \nIn addition, the device has color controls for hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast and controls for Cr and Cb offsets. The ADV7403 also incorporates a vertical blanking interval data \nprocessor and a video programming system (VPS) on the device.  \nThe differen tial gain of the ADV7403 is 0.4% typical, and the \ndifferential phase is 0. 4° typical.  \nCOMPONENT VIDEO PROC ESSING  \nThe ADV7403 suppo rts 525i, 625i, 525p, 625p, 720p, 1080i, \n1080p, and many other HDTV formats. It provides automatic adjustments for gain (contrast) and offset (brightness), as well \nas manual adjustment controls. Furthermore, the ADV7403 not \nonly supports analog component YPrPb/RGB video formats \nwith embedded synchronization or with separate HS, VS, and CS,  \nbut also supports YCrCb -to-RGB and RGB -to-YCrCb conversions  \nby any -to-any, 3 × 3 color -space conversion mat rices.  \nStandard identification (STDI) enables detection of the component  \nformat at the system level, and a synchronization source polarity \ndetector (SSPD) determines the source and polarity of the \nsynchronization signals that accompany the input video.  \nCertified Macrovision copy protection detection is available on \ncomponent formats (525i, 625i, 525p, and 625p).  \nWhen no video input is present, free- run output mode provides \nstable timing.  \nThe ADV 7403 also supports arbitrary pixel sampling for \nnonstandard video sources.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRev. B | Page 12 of 20 \nData Sheet  ADV7403  \n \nRGB GRAPHICS PROCESS ING  \nThe ADV7403 provides 140 MSPS conversion rate support  of \nRGB input resolutions up to 1280 × 1024 at  75 Hz (SXGA ) and \n110 MSPS conversion rate for the ADV7403BSTZ -110. It also \nprovides a utomatic or manual clamp and gain controls for \ngraphics modes. \nThe RGB graphics processing fu nctionality features c ontrast \nand brightness controls , automatic detection of synchronization \nsource and polarity by the SSPD block, standard identification \nenabled by the STDI block, and arbitrary  pixel sampling \nsupport for nonstandard video sources.  \nAddi tional RGB graphics processing features of the ADV7403 \ninclude the following:  \n• 32-phase DLL support of optimum pixel clock sampling.  \n• Color -space conversion of RGB to YCrCb and decimation \nto a 4: 2:2 format for videocentric back -end IC interfacing.  \n• Data enable (DE) output signal supplied for direct connection to the HDMI/DVI transmitter IC.  DIGITAL VIDEO INPUT PORT  \nThe ADV7403 supports raw 8-/10-bit CVBS data from a digital \ntuner  and 24-bit RGB input data from a DVI receiver  chip, \noutput converted to YCrCb 4:2:2 . It also supports 24 -bit 4:4: 4, \n16-/20-bit 4:2:2 525i, 625i, 525p, 625p, 1080i, 720p, VGA to \nSXGA at 60 Hz input data from HDMI  receiver chip, output \nconverted to 16 -bit 4:2:2 YCrCb . \nGENERAL FEATURES  \nThe ADV7403 features HS, VS, and FIELD output signals with \nprogrammable position, polarity, and width . It also includes a \nprogrammable interrupt request output pin ( INT ), signals \nSDP/CP status changes , and supports two I2C host port \ninterfaces (control and VBI).  \nThe ADV7403 offers low power co nsumption: 1.8 V digital \ncore, 3.3 V analog and digital input/output, low power power -\ndown mode, and green PC mode.  \nThe ADV7403 BSTZ -110 operates over the industrial temperature \nrange (−40°C to +85°C ) and is available in a 100 -lead, 14 mm × \n14 mm, RoHS -compliant  LQFP .  \nIt is also available in a  140 MHz speed grade ( ADV7403KST -140).  \n \n \n \nRev. B | Page 13 of 20 \nADV7403  Data Sheet  \n \nTHEORY OF OPERATION \nANALOG FRONT END  \nThe ADV7403 analog front end comprise s four noise shaped \nvideo (NSV ®), 12-bit ADCs  that digitize the analog video signal \nbefore applying it to the standard definition processor  (SDP ) or \ncomponent processo r (CP). See Table 8 for the maximum sampling  \nrates . The analog front end uses differential channels to each \nADC to ens ure high performance in a mixed signal application.  \nThe front end also includes a 12 -channel in put mux that enables \nmultiple video signals to be applied to the ADV7403. Current \nand voltage clamps are positioned in front of each ADC to \nensure that the video signal remains within the range  of the \nconverter. Fine clamping of the video signals is performed \ndownstream by digital fine clamping either in the CP or SDP .  \nOptional antialiasing filters are positioned in front of each ADC. These filters can be used to band -limit standard \ndefinition video signals, removing spurious, out -of-band noise.  \nThe ADCs are configured to run in 4× oversampling mode when decoding composite and S -Video inputs; 2× oversampling \nis performed for component 525i, 625i, 525p, and 625p sources. All other video standards  are 1× oversampled. Oversampling \nthe video signals reduces the cost and complexity of external \nantialiasing filters with the benefit of an increased signal -to-\nnoise ratio (SNR).  \nThe ADV7403  can support simultaneous processing of CVBS and  \nRGB standard definition signals to enable SCART compatibility \nand overlay functionality. A combination of CVBS and RGB inputs can be mixed and output under control of I\n2C registers \nand the fast blank pin.  \nTabl e 8. Maximum ADC Sampling Rates  \nModel  Maximum ADC Sampling Rate (MHz)  \nADV7403 BSTZ -110 110  \nADV7403 KSTZ -140 140 \nSTANDARD DEFINITION PROCESSOR  (SDP)  \nThe SDP section is capable of decoding a large selection of baseband video signals in composite S -Video and YUV formats. \nThe video standards supported by the SDP include PAL (B, D, I, G, H, M, N, Nc, 60), NTSC (J, M, 4.43) , and SECAM (B, D, G, \nK, L) . The ADV7403  can automatically detect the video standard  \nand process it accordingly.  \nThe SDP has a super adaptive 2 -D, 5-line comb filter that gives \nsuperi or chrominance and luminance separation when decoding  a \ncomposite video signal. This highly adaptive filter automatically \nadjusts its processing mode according to video standard and \nsignal quality with no user intervention required.  The SDP has \nan IF filte r block that  compensate s for attenuation in the high \nfrequency luma spectrum due to the tuner SAW filter.   \n The SDP has specific luminance and chrominance parameter control for brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue. \nThe ADV7403 implements a patented adaptive digital line length \ntracking ( ADLLT ™) algorithm to track varying video line lengths \nfrom sources such as a VCR. ADLLT enables the ADV7403 to \ntrack and decode poor quality video sources such as VCRs, noisy \nsources from tuner outputs, VCD players, and camcorders. The SDP also contains a chroma transient improvement (CTI) processor. This processor increases the edge rate on chrom a \ntransitions, resulting in a sharper video image.  \nThe SDP can process a variety of VBI data services, such as \nTeleText, closed captioning (CC), wide screen signaling (WSS), video programming system (VPS), vertical interval time codes \n(VITC), copy generat ion management system (CGMS) , Gemstar \n1×/2×, and extended data service (XDS). The ADV7403 SDP \nsection has a Macrovision 7.1 detection circuit that allows it to detect Types I, II, and III prote ction levels. The decoder is also \nfully robust to all Macrovision signal inputs.  \nCOMPONENT PROCESSOR  (CP) \nThe CP section is capable of decoding/digitizing a wide range of component video formats in any color space. Component video standards supported by th e CP are 525i, 625i, 525p, 625p, 720p, \n1080i, 1250i, VGA up to SXGA at  75 Hz ( ADV7403KSTZ -140 \nonly) , and many other standards not listed here.  \nThe CP section of the ADV7403 contains an AGC block. When \nno embedded sync is present, the video gain can be set manually . \nThe AGC section is followed by a digital clamp circuit that ensures that the video signal is clamped to the correct bla nking \nlevel. Automatic adjustments within the CP include gain (contrast)  \nand offset (brightness); manual adjustment controls are also supported.  \nA fully programmable any -to-any, 3 × 3 color space conversion \nmatrix is placed between the analog front end and  the CP section . \nThis enables YPrPb -to-RGB and RGB -to-YCrCb conversions. \nMany other standards of color space can be implemented using the color space converter.  \nThe output section of the CP is highly flexible. It can be configured  \nin SDR with one data pac ket per clock cycle or in a DDR mode \nwhere data is presented on the rising and falling edge s of the \nclock. In SDR mode, a 16 -/20-bit 4:2:2 or 24- /30-bit 4:4:4 output \nis possible. In these modes, HS, VS, and FIELD/DE (where \napplicable) timing  reference sign als are provided. In DDR mode, \nthe ADV7403 can be configured in an 8 -/10-bit 4:2:2 Y crCb or \n12-bit 4:4:4 Yc r C b /RGB pixel output interface with corresponding \ntiming signals.  \n \n \n \n \nRev. B | Page 14 of 20 \nData Sheet  ADV7403  \n \nThe ADV7403 is capable of supporting an external DVI/HDMI \nreceiver. The digital interface expect s 24-bit 4:4:4 or 16- /20-bit \n4:2:2 bit data (either graphics RGB or component video YcrCb), \naccompanied by HS, VS , DE, and a fully synchronous clock \nsignal. The data is processed in the CP and output as 16 -bit \n4:2:2 Y crCb data.  \nThe CP section contains circuitry to enable the detection of \nMacrovision encoded YPrPb signals for 525i, 625i, 525p, and 625p. It is designed  to be fully robust when decoding these \ntypes of signals.  VBI extraction of CGMS data is performed by the CP section of \nthe ADV7403 for interlaced, progressive, and high definition \nscanning rat es. The data extracted can be read back over the I\n2C \ninterface. For more detailed product information , see the \nADV7403 product page.  \n \n \n \n \nRev.
