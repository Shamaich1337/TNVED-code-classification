Gain Drift Distribution  \n \n \n \nRev. 0 | Page 9  of 16 \nAD8418  Data Sheet  \n \nTHEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD8418 is a sin gle-supply, zero drift, difference amplifier \nthat uses a unique architecture to accurately amplify small \ndifferential current shunt voltages in the presence of rapidly \nchanging co mmon -mode voltage s. \nIn typical applications, the AD8418 is used to measure current \nby amplifying the voltage across a shunt resistor connected to its \ninputs by a gain of 20  V/V  (see Figure 26).  \nThe AD8418 is designed to provide excellent common -mode \nrejectio n, even with PWM common -mode inputs that can change \nat very fast rates, for example, 1 V/ns. The AD8418 contains \npatented  technology to eliminate the negative effects of such \nfast changing external common -mode variations.  \nThe AD8418 features an input offset drift of less than 500  nV/°C . \nThis performance is achieve d through a novel zero  drift \narchitecture that does not compromise band width, which is \ntypically rated at 2 50 kHz.  The reference inputs, V REF1 and V REF2, are tied through 100 kΩ \nresistors to the positive input of the main amplifier, which allows the outpu t offset to be adjusted anywhere in the output operating \nrange. The gain is 1  V/V from the reference pins to the output \nwhen the reference pins are used in parallel. When the pins are \nused to divide the supply, the gain is 0.5 V/V .   \nThe AD8418 offers breakthrough performance without \ncompromising any of the robust application needs typical of solenoid or motor control. The ability to reject PWM input common -mode voltages and the zero drift architec ture \nprovid ing low offset and offset drift  allow s the AD8418 to \ndeliver total accuracy for these demanding applications.  \n \n \n \n \n+ISHUNT\nG = 20VCM = –2V TO +70V VS = 2.7V TO 5.5V\nVREF1\nVREF2OUT\n0VVS\nVS/2VOUT\nISHUNTEMI\nFILTER\nEMI\nFILTERVCM\n0V70V\nAD8418VS\n+IN\n–IN–\nGND\n–50A50ARSHUNT\n11546-225 \nFigure 26. Typical Application   \n \n \nRev. 0 | Page 10 of 16 \nData Sheet  AD8418  \n \nOUTPUT OFFSET ADJUSTMENT  \nThe output of the AD8418 can be adjusted for unidirectional or \nbidirectional operation.  \nUNIDIRECTIONAL OPERA TION  \nUnidirectional operation allows the AD8418  to measure cu rrents \nthrough a resistive shunt in one direction. The basic modes for \nunidirectional operation are ground referenced  output mode \nand VS referenced output mode.  \nFor unidirectional operation, the output  can be set at the negative  \nrail (near ground) or at the positive rail (near V S) when the \ndifferential input is 0 V . The output moves to the opposite rail \nwhen a correct polarity differential input voltage is applied. The \nrequired polarity of the different ial input depends on the output \nvoltage setting. If the output is set at the positive rail, the input polarity needs to be negative to move the output down. If the output is set at ground, the polarity must be  positive to move \nthe ou tput up.  \nGround Refere nced Output  \nWhen using the AD8418 in this mode, both reference d inputs are \ntied to ground, which causes the output to sit at the negative rail when there are zero differential volts at the input (see Figure 27). \n–\n+R1\nOUT\nGNDVS\nVREF1\nVREF2AD8418\nR2\nR3R4\n–IN\n+IN\n11546-025 \nFigure 27.

VS Referenced Output  \nBIDIRECTIONAL OPERAT ION  \nBidirectional operation allows the AD8418 to measure currents \nthrough a resistive shunt in two directions.  \nIn this case, the output is set anywhere within the output range. \nTypically, it is set at half -scale for equal range in both dir ections. \nIn some cases, however, it is s et at a voltage other than half scale \nwhen the bidirectional current is nonsymmetrical.  \nAdjusting the output is accomplished by applying voltage(s) to \nthe referenced  inputs.  \nVREF1 and V REF2 are tied to internal resis tors that connect to an \ninternal offset node. There is no operational difference between the pins.  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \nRev. 0 | Page 11 of 16 \nAD8418  Data Sheet  \n \nEXTERNAL REFERENCED  OUTPUT  \nTying both pins together and to a ref erence produces an output \nequal to the  reference voltage when there is no differe ntial input \n(see Figure 29). The output moves down from the reference \nvoltage when the input is negative , relative to the − IN pin , and \nup when the input is positive , relative to the − IN pin.  \n–\n+R1\nOUT\nGNDVS\nVREF1\nVREF2AD8418\nR2\nR3R4\n–IN\n+IN\n2.5V\n11546-027 \nFigure 29. External Referenced  Output  \nSPLITTING THE SUPPLY  \nBy tying one reference pin t o VS and the other to the ground pin, \nthe output is set at half of the su pply when there is no di fferential  \ninput (see Figure 30). The benefit is that an  external reference \nis not required to offset the output for bidirectional current \nmeasurement. Tying one reference pin to V S and the other to \nthe ground pin  creates a midscale offset that is rati ometric to \nthe supply, which means that if the supply increases or decreases, \nthe output remains at half the supply. For exa mple, if the supply \nis 5.0 V , the output is at half scale or 2.5 V . If  the su pply increases  by \n10% (to 5.5 V), the output goes to 2.75 V .  –\n+R1\nOUT\nGNDVS\nVREF1\nVREF2AD8418\nR2\nR3R4\n–IN\n+IN\n11546-028 \nFigure 30.

Additionally, the typical \nlow offset drift of 0.1 µ V/°C  means that the measurement error \nbetween the two motor phases is at a minimum over temperature. \nThe AD8418 rejects PWM input common -mode voltages in the \n−2 V to + 70 V (with  a 5 V supply) range. Monitoring the current  \non the motor phase allows sampling of the current at any point and provi des diagnostic information such as a short to GND \nand battery. Refer to Figure  33 for the typical phase current \nmeasurement setup with  the AD8418.  \nH-Bridge Motor Control  \nAnother typical application for the AD8418 is as part of the \ncontrol loop in H -bridge motor control. In this case, the shunt \nresistor is placed in the middle of the H -bridge so that it can \naccurately measure current in both directions by using the shunt available at the motor  (see Figure 32). Using an amplifier \nand shunt in this location is a better sol ution than a ground referenced op amp because ground  is not typically a stable \nreference voltage in this type of applic ation. The instability of \nthe ground reference causes inaccuracies in the measur ements \nthat c an be made with a simple ground referenced op amp. The \nAD8418 measures current in both directions as the H -bridge \nswitches and the motor changes direction. The output of the AD8418 is configured in an external referenced bidire ctional \nmode (see the Bidirectional Operation  section).  \nAD8418+IN\nSHUNTMOTORVREF1VS OUT\n–IN GND5VCONTROLLER\nVREF2NC5V\n2.5V\n11546-030 \nFigure 32.

An inductive \nload (solenoid) is tied to a power supply. A resistive shunt is \nplaced between the switch and the load (see Figure 34). An \nadvantage of placing the shunt on the high side is that the e ntire \ncurrent, including the re circulation current, can be measured \nbecause  the shunt remains in the loop when the switch is off. In \naddition, diagnostics can be enhanced because shorts to ground \ncan be detected with the shunt on the high side . \nIn this circuit configuration, when the switch is closed, the \ncommon -mode voltage moves down to near the negative rail. \nWhen the swit ch is open, the voltage reversal across the i nductive \nload causes the common -mode voltage to be held one diode \ndrop above the battery by the clamp diode.  –IN1\nGND2\nVREF23\nNC4+IN\n8\nVREF1\n7\nVS\n6\nOUTOUTPUT5V\nINDUCTIVE\nLOADCLAMP\nDIODE\nBATTERY\nSWITCHSHUNT\nNC = NO CONNECT.+\n–5\nAD8418\n11546-032 \nFigure 34. Low -Side Switch   \nHigh -Side Current Sense with a High -Side Switch  \nThe high -side current sense with a h igh-side switch configuration  \nminimizes the possibility of unexpected solenoid activation and excessive corrosion (see Figure 35). In this case, both the switch \nand the shunt are on the high side. When the switch is off, the \nbatte ry is remove d from the load, which prevents damage from \npotential shorts to ground while still allowing the recirculating \ncurrent to be measured and to provide diagnostics. Removing  the \npower supply from the load for the majority of the time minimizes  \nthe corrosive effects that c an be caused by the differential \nvoltage between the load and ground.  \nWhen using a high- side switch, the battery voltage is connected \nto the l oad when the switch is closed, causing the common -mode  \nvoltage to increase to the battery voltage.
