The \ndesign is compliant to 40GBASE -LR4 of the IEEE P802.3ba standard. The module converts 4 inputs \nchannels (ch) of 10Gb/s electrical data to 4 CWDM optical signals, and multiplexes them into a \nsingle channel for 40Gb/s optical trans mission. Reversely, on the receiver side, the module optically \nde-multiplexes a 40Gb/s input into 4 CWDM channels signals, and converts them to 4 channel \noutput electrical data.  \nThe central wavelengths of the 4 CWDM channels are 1271, 1291, 1311 and 1331 n m as members of \nthe CWDM wavelength grid defined in ITU -T G694.2. It contains a duplex LC connector for the \noptical interface and a 38 -pin connector for the electrical interface. To minimize the optical \ndispersion in the long -haul system, single -mode fiber  (SMF) has to be applied in this module.  \nThe product is designed with form factor, optical/electrical connection and digital diagnostic \ninterface according to the QSFP Multi -Source Agreement (MSA). It has been designed to meet the \nharshest external operati ng conditions including temperature, humidity and EMI interference.  \nThe module operates from a single +3.3V power supply and LVCMOS/LVTTL global control \nsignals such as Module Present, Reset, Interrupt and Low Power Mode are available with the \nmodules. A 2 -wire serial interface is available to send and receive more complex  control signals and \nto obtain digital diagnostic information. Individual channels can be addressed and unused channels \ncan be shut down for maximum design flexibility.  \nThe OPQC10 is designed with form factor, optical/electrical connection and digital dia gnostic \n40Gb/s 10km QSFP+ Transceiver  (OPQC10)  \nHot Pluggable, Duplex LC Connector , Single mode \n \nShenzhen  Opway Communication Co., Ltd.  \n3F, Building 5, Section 2, Baiwangxin High -tech Industrial Park,1002 Songbai Rd.,  \nNanshan, Shenzhen ,Guangdong,China 518000  \nTel: +86 -755-86000306        Fax: +86 -755-86000825  \nE-mail: info@opwaytech.com   http://www.opwaytech.com  Page 2 of 10 interface according to the QSFP Multi -Source Agreement (MSA).

#### Description:
The OPQC10 is a high-performance optical transceiver module designed for 10 km optical communication applications. It operates at a data rate of 40 Gb/s by utilizing four CWDM (Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing) lanes, each capable of transmitting data at up to 11.2 Gbps. The module converts electrical signals into optical signals and vice versa, facilitating high-speed data transmission over single-mode fiber. It features a duplex LC connector for optical interfacing and is compliant with the QSFP Multi-Source Agreement (MSA).

#### Typical Applications:
The OPQC10 transceiver is primarily used in:
- **Data Centers:** For interconnecting switches and routers, enabling high-speed data transfer.
- **Metro Networks:** Supporting long-distance communication with minimal signal degradation.
- **40G BASE-LR4 Ethernet Links:** Providing reliable connections for high-bandwidth applications.
- **Rack-to-Rack Communication:** Facilitating efficient data transfer between server racks.

This transceiver is ideal for applications requiring high data rates and long-distance transmission, making it suitable for modern networking infrastructures.
