These devices contain a 55 m /C0087\ncurrent−limited P−channel MOSFET that can operate over an input\nvoltage range of 1.8 to 5.5 V . Internally, current is prevented fromflowing when the MOSFET is off and the output voltage is higher than\nthe input voltage. Switch control is by a logic input (ON) capable of\ninterfacing directly with low −voltage control signals. Each part\ncontains thermal shutdown protection that shuts off the switch toprevent damage to the part when a continuous over −current condition\ncauses excessive heating.\nWhen the switch current reaches the current limit, the parts operate\nin a constant −current mode to prohibit excessive currents from\ncausing damage. For the FPF2193 and FPF2194, if the constantcurrent condition still persists after 30 ms, the parts shut off the switch\nand pull the fault signal pin (FLAGB) LOW. The FPF2193 has an\nauto−restart feature that turns the switch on again after 450 ms if the\nON pin is still active. The FPF2194 does not have this auto −restart\nfeature, so the switch remains off until the ON pin is cycled. TheFPF2195 does not turn off after a current limit fault, but remains in the\nconstant−current mode indefinitely. The minimum current limit can be\nset as low as 45 mA.\nThese parts are available in a space −saving six ball advanced 0.98 x\n1.48 mm WLCSP package.\nFeatures\n•<1.8 to 5.5 V I nput V oltage Range\n•Controlled Turn −On\n•0.1 to 1.5 A Adjustable Current Limit\n•Under−V oltage Lockout\n•Thermal Shutdown\n•<2 /C0109A Shutdown Current\n•Auto Restart\n•Fast Current Limit Response Time\n•5 /C0109s to Moderate Over Currents\n•30 ns to Hard Shorts\n•Fault Blanking\n•Reverse Current BlockingMARKING DIAGRAM\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information on page 13 of\nthis data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATIONWLCSP6 1.48x0.98x0.582\nCASE 567RN\nSx&K\n&.&2&Z\nSx = Device Code (x = 6, 7, 9, Y)\n&K = 2−Digits Lot Run Traceability Code\n&. = Pin One Dot&2 = 2−Digit Date Code\n&Z = Assembly Plant Code\nApplications\n•PDAs\n•Cell P hones\n•Handheld GPS Devices\n•Portable Enterprise / Industrial Devices\n•Digital Cameras\n•Peripheral Ports and Accessories\n•Portable Medical Equipment\n•Hot Swap Supplies\nFPF2193, FPF2194, FPF2195\nwww. onsemi.com\n2APPLICATION DIAGRAM\nFigure 1.

The core of\neach device is a 55 m /C0087 P−channel MOSFET and a controller\ncapable of functioning over the wide input operating range of1.8 − 5.5 V . The controller protects against system\nmalfunctions through current limiting, under −voltage\nlockout, and thermal shutdown. The current limit isadjustable from 100 mA (45 mA for FPF2195BUCX) to1.5 A through the selection of an external resistor.\nOn/Off Control\nThe ON pin controls the state of the switch. When ON is\nHIGH, the switch is in ON state. Activating ON continuouslyholds the switch in the ON state so long as there is no fault.For all versions, an under −voltage on V\nIN or a junction\ntemperature in excess of 140 °C overrides the ON control to\nturn off the switch. In addition, excessive currents cause the\nswitch to turn off in the FPF2193 and FPF2194. The FPF2193has an auto −restart feature that automatically turns the switch\non again after 450 ms. For the FPF2194, the ON pin must betoggled to turn the switch on again. The FPF2195 does notturn off in response to an over −current condition, but remains\noperating in constant −current mode as long as ON is active\nand the thermal shutdown or under −voltage lockout have not\nactivated.\nFault Reporting\nUpon the detection of an over −current, input\nunder−voltage, or over −temperature condition, FLAGB\nsignals the fault mode by activating LOW. For the FPF2193\nand FPF2194, the FLAGB goes LOW at the end of theblanking time, while FLAGB goes LOW immediately for theFPF2195. FLAGB remains LOW through the auto −restart\ntime for the FPF2195. For the FPF2194, FLAGB is latchedLOW and ON must be toggled to release it. With theFPF2195, FLAGB is LOW during the faults and immediatelyreturns HIGH at the end of the fault condition. FLAGB is an\nopen−drain MOSFET that requires a pull −up resistor between\nV\nIN and FLAGB. During  shutdown, the pull −down on\nFLAGB is disabled to reduce current draw from the supply.\nCurrent Limiting\nThe current limit ensures that the current through the switch\ndoesn’t exceed a maximum value, while not limiting at less\nthan a minimum value. The current at which the parts limit isadjustable through the selection of an external resistorconnected to I\nSET. Information for  selecting the resistor is\nfound in the Application Information section. The FPF2193and FPF2194 have a blanking time of 30 ms, nominally,during which the switch acts as a constant current source. Atthe end of the blanking time, the switch is turned off.The FPF2195 has no current limit blanking period, so it\nremains in a constant current state until the ON pin isdeactivated or the thermal shutdown turns off the switch.\nFor preventing the switch from large power dissipation\nduring heavy load, a short −circuit detection feature is\nintroduced. Short −circuit condition is detected by, observing\nthe output voltage. The switch is put into short −circuit\ncurrent−limiting mode if the switch is loaded with a heavy\nload. When the output voltage drops below V\nSCTH , the\nshort−circuit detection threshold voltage, the current limit\nvalue is re −conditioned and the short −circuit current −limit\nvalue is decreased to 62.5% of the current limit value. This\nkeeps the power dissipation of the part below a certain limiteven at dead −short conditions at 5.5 V input voltage. The\nV\nSCTH  value is set to be 1 V . At around 1.1 V of output\nvoltage, the switch is removed from short −circuit\ncurrent−limiting mode and the current limit is set to the\ncurrent limit value.\nUnder−Voltage Lockout (UVLO)\nThe under −voltage lockout turns the switch off if the input\nvoltage drops below the under −voltage lockout threshold.\nWith the ON pin active, the input voltage rising above theunder−voltage lockout threshold causes a controlled turn −on\nof the switch, which limits current over shoot.\nThermal Shutdown\nThe thermal shutdown protects the die from internally or\nexternally generated excessive temperatures. During anover−temperature condition, FLAGB is activated and the\nswitch is turned off. The switch automatically turns on again\nif temperature of the die drops below the thresholdtemperature.\nReverse −Current Blocking\nThe entire FPF2193/94/95 family has a reverse current\nblocking feature that protects the input source against current\nflow from output to input. For a standard USB power design,this is an important feature to protect the USB host from beingdamaged due to reverse current flow on V\nBUS.\nWhen the load switch is OFF, no current flows from the\noutput to the input. If the switch is turned on and the outputvoltage is greater than input vo ltage, this feature is activated\nand turns off the switch. This prevents any current flow from\noutput to input. The reverse −current blocking feature is\ndeactivated if the V\nOUT − VIN is smaller  than a typically\n50 mV threshold. During this time, some current(50 mV/R\nON) flows from the output to input until  input\nvoltage becomes greater than output voltage. FLAGBoperation is independent of the reverse −current blocking and\ndoes not report a fault condition if this feature is activated.\nFPF2193, FPF2194, FPF2195\nwww. onsemi.com\n11Figure 27.

Typical Application\nSetting Current Limit\nThe FPF2193, FPF2194, and FPF2195 current limit is set\nwith an external resistor connected between I SET and GND.\nThis resistor is selected using the following equation:\nRSET/C0043551.6\nILIM(eq. 1)\nRSET is in /C0087 and I SET is in Amps.\nTable 1 can also be used to select R SET. A typical\napplication would be the 500 mA current required by a singleUSB port. Using Table 1, an appropriate selection for the\nR\nSET resistor would be 788 /C0087. This ensures that the port load\ncould draw 525 mA, but not more than 875 mA. Likewise for\na dual−port system; an R SET of 368 /C0087 always delivers at least\n1125 mA and never more than 1875 mA.\nTable 1. CURRENT LIMIT VARIOUS R SET VALUES\nRSET (/C0087)Min.

FPF2195BUCX only.Input Capacitor\nTo limit the voltage drop on the input supply caused by\ntransient inrush currents when the switch is turned on into a\ndischarged load capacitor or a short −circuit, a capacitor\nneeds to be placed between V IN and GND. A 0.1 /C0109F ceramic\ncapacitor, C IN, placed close to the pins is usually sufficient.\nHigher values of C IN can be used to further reduce the\nvoltage drop.\nOutput Capacitor\nA 0.1 /C0109F capacitor, C OUT, should be placed between\nVOUT and GND. This capacitor prevents parasitic board\ninductances from forcing V OUT below GND when the\nswitch turns off. For the FPF2193 and FPF2194, the totaloutput capacitance needs to be kept below a maximumvalue, C\nOUT(max), to prevent the part from registering an\nover−current condition and turning off the switch. The\nmaximum output capacitance can be determined from thefollowing formula:\nCOUT(max)/C0043ILIM(max)/C0032tBLANK(min)\nVIN(eq. 2)\nPower Dissipation\nDuring normal operation as a switch, the power dissipated\ndepends upon the level at which the current limit is set. The\nmaximum allowed setting for the current limit is 1.5 A andresults in a power dissipation of :\nCOUT(max)/C0043ILIM(max)/C0032tBLANK(min)\nVIN(eq. 3)\nIf the part goes into current limit, the maximum power\ndissipation occurs when the output is shorted to ground. For\nthe FPF2193, the power dissipation scales by theauto−restart time, t\nRSTRT , and the over −current blanking\ntime, t BLANK , so that the maximum power dissipated is:\n/C004330\n30/C0041450/C00325.5/C00321.5/C0043515.6 mW(eq. 4)P(max)/C0043tBLANK\ntBLANK/C0041tRSTRT/C0032VIN(max)/C0032ILIM(max)\nFPF2193, FPF2194, FPF2195\nwww. onsemi.com\n13This is more power than the package can dissipate, but the\nthermal shutdown of the part activates to protect the partfrom damage due to excessive heating. When using the\nFPF2194, attention must be given to the manual resetting of\nthe part. The junction temperature is only able to increase tothe thermal shutdown threshold. Once this temperature hasbeen reached, toggling ON does not turn the switch on until\nthe junction temperature drops. For the FPF2195, a short onthe output causes the part to operate in a constant −current\nstate, dissipating a worst −case power of:\n/C00435.5/C00321.5/C00438.25 W(eq. 5)P(max)/C0043VIN(max)/C0032ILIM(max)This large amount of power activates the thermal\nshutdown and the part cycles in and out of thermal shutdown\nas long as the ON pin is active and the short is present.\nBoard Layout\nFor best performance, all traces should be as short as\npossible. To be most effective, the input and outputcapacitors should be placed close to the device to minimize\nthe effects that parasitic trace inductances may have on\nnormal and short −circuit operation. Using wide traces for\nV\nIN, VOUT, and GND help to minimize parasitic electrical\neffects along w ith minimizing the case −to−ambient thermal\nimpedance.\nORDERING INFORMATION\nDevice Order\nNumberCurrent \nLimit (mA)Current Limit\nBlanking Time (ms)Auto−Restart\nTime (ms)ON Pin \nActivityTop\nMark Package Type Shipping†\nFPF2193 100 − 1500 15/30/60 225/450/900 Active\nHIGHS6 WLCSP6\n1.48x0.98x0.582\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nFPF2194 15/30/60 NA S7 3000 / Tape & Reel\nFPF2195 0 NA S9 3000 / Tape & Reel\nFPF2195BUCX 45 − 1500 0S NA SY 3000 / Tape & Reel\n†For information on tape and reel specifications, including part orientation and tape sizes, please refer to our Tape and Reel Packaging\nSpecifications Brochure, BRD8011/D.\nWLCSP6 1.48x0.98x0.582\nCASE 567RN\nISSUE O\nDATE 30 NOV 2016MECHANICAL CASE OUTLINE\nPACKAGE DIMENSIONS\nON Semiconductor and          are trademarks of Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC dba ON Semiconductor or its subsidiari es in the United States and/or other countries.\nON Semiconductor reserves the right to make changes without further notice to any products herein.
