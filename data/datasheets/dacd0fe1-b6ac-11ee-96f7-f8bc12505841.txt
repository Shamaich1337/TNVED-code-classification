With pin 1 connected to  \nground and pin 2 connected to a signal- or data-line which has to be protected. As long as the voltage level on the data- or  \nsignal-line is between 0 V (ground level) and the specified maximum reverse working voltage (V RWM) the protection diode  \nbetween data line and ground offers a high isolation to the ground line. The protection device behaves like an open switch. \uf020\nAs soon as any positive transient voltage signal exceeds the break through voltage level of the protection diode, the diode  \nbecomes conductive and shorts the transient current to ground . Now the protection device behaves like a closed switch. The  \nclamping voltage (V C) is defined by the breakthrough voltage (V BR) level plus the voltage dro p at the series impedance  \n(resistance and inductance) of the protection device.Any negative transient signal wi ll be clamped accordingly. The nega tive transient current is flow ing in the forward direction o f \nthe protection diode. The low forward voltage (V\nF) clamps the negative transient close to the ground level.\nDue to the different clamping levels in forward and reverse direction the VESD05A1-02V clamping beha viour is bidirectional and  \nasymmetrical (BiAs).\nELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS (Tamb = 25 °C, unless otherwise specified)\nPARAMETER TEST CONDITIONS/REMARKS SYMBOL MIN.
