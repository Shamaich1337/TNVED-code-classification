The low noise of 0.9 nV/√Hz and \nlow total harmonic distortion of −120 dB in audio bandwidths give the AD797 the wide dynamic range necessary for preamps \nin microphones and mixing consoles. \nFurthermore, the AD797 has an excellent slew rate of 20 V/μs \nand a 110 MHz gain bandwidth, which makes it highly suitable \nfor low frequency ultrasound applications. \nThe AD797 is also useful in infrared (IR) and sonar imaging \napplications, where the widest dynamic range is necessary. The \nlow distortion and 16-bit settling time of the AD797 make it \nideal for buffering the inputs to Σ-Δ ADCs or the outputs of \nhigh resolution DACs, especially when the device is used in critical applications such as seismic detection or in spectrum analyzers. Key features such as a 50 mA output current drive \nand the specified power supply voltage range of ±5 V to ±15 V \nmake the AD797 an excellent general-purpose amplifier.  \n00846-0025\n0\n10M3\n1\n1002\n104\n1M 100k 10k 1k\nFREQUENCY (Hz)INPUT VOLTAGE NOISE (nV/ √Hz)\n \nFigure 1.

THD vs. Frequency \n \n \nData Sheet AD797\n \nRev. K | Page 11 of 19 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe architecture of the AD797 was developed to overcome \ninherent limitations in previous amplifier designs. Previous \nprecision amplifiers used three stages to ensure high open-loop gain (see Figure 31) at the expense of additional frequency com-\npensation components. Slew rate and settling performance are \nusually compromised, and dynamic performance is not adequate beyond audio frequencies. As can be seen in Figure 31, the first stage gain is rolled off at high frequencies by the compensation network. Second stage noise and distortion then appears at the \ninput and degrade performance. The AD797, on the other hand, \nuses a single ultrahigh gain stage to achieve dc as well as dynamic \nprecision. As shown in the simplified schematic (Figure 32), Node A, Node B, and Node C track the input voltage, forcing the operating points of all pairs of devices in the signal path to match. By exploiting the inherent matching of devices fabricated on \nthe same IC chip, high open-loop gain, CMRR, PSRR, and low \nV\nOS are guaranteed by pairwise device matching (that is, NPN \nto NPN and PNP to PNP), not by an absolute parameter such as \nbeta and the early voltage. \nR1\nR1C1gm\ngmGAIN = gm × R1 × 5 × 106\nGAIN = gm × R1 × A2 × A3C1\nR2BUFFER\nBUFFERRL\nRLVOUT\nVOUTa.\nb.A2 A3C2\n00846-030 \nFigure 31.

AD797  Simplified Schematic \nThis matching benefits not just dc precision, but, because it holds \nup dynamically, both distortion and settling time are also reduced. \nThis single stage has a voltage gain of >5 × 106 and V OS < 80 μV , \nwhile at the same time providing a THD + noise of less than \n−120 dB and true 16-bit settling in less than 800 ns.  The elimination of second-stage noise effects has the additional \nbenefit of making the low noise of the AD797 (<0.9 nV/√Hz) \nextend to beyond 1 MHz. This means new levels of perform-ance for sampled data and imaging systems. All of this \nperformance as well as load drive in excess of 30 mA are made \npossible by the Analog Devices, Inc., advanced complementary \nbipolar (CB) process. \nAnother unique feature of this circuit is that the addition of a \nsingle capacitor, C\nN (see Figure 32), enables cancellation of \ndistortion due to the output stage. This can best be explained by referring to a simplified representation of the AD797 using \nidealized blocks for the different circuit elements (Figure 33). \nA single equation yields the open-loop transfer function of this \namplifier; solving it at Node B yields \n\uf077 \uf02d \uf077 \uf02d \uf077\uf03d\njACj C jACg\nVV\nC\nNNm\nINOUT \nwhere: \ngm is the transconductance of Q1 and Q2. \nA is the gain of the output stage (~1). \nVOUT is voltage at the output. \nVIN is differential input voltage. \nWhen C N is equal to C C, the ideal single-pole op amp response \nis attained: \nC jg\nVVm\nINOUT\n\uf077\uf03d  \nIn Figure 33, the terms of Node A, which include the properties of the output stage, such as output impedance and distortion, cancel \nby simple subtraction.

Therefore, it is important to consider the total input-referred noise (e\nNtotal), which includes contributions from voltage \nnoise (e N), current noise (i N), and resistor noise (√4 kTR S).  \n2 / 1 2 2] ) ( 4 [S N S N N R i kTR e total e\uf0b4 \uf02b \uf02b \uf03d  (1) \nwhere R S is the total input source resistance. \nThis equation is plotted for the AD797 in Figure 34. Because \noptimum dc performance is obtained with matched source \nresistances, this case is considered even though it is clear from \nEquation 1 that eliminating the balancing source resistance \nlowers the total noise by reducing the total R S by a factor of 2. \nAt very low source resistance (R S < 50 Ω), the voltage noise of the \namplifier dominates. As source resistance increases, the Johnson \nnoise of R S dominates until a higher resistance of R S > 2 kΩ is \nachieved; the current noise component is larger than the resistor noise. \n00846-033100\n1\n0.110\n10 100 1000 10000\nSOURCE RESISTANCE ( Ω)NOISE (nV/ √Hz)TOTAL NOISE\nRESISTOR\nNOISE\nONLY\n \nFigure 34.

Several techniques can \nbe used to make this measurement. The usual technique involves amplifying, filtering, and measuring the amplifier noise for a \npredetermined test time. The noise bandwidth of the filter is \ncorrected for, and the test time is carefully controlled because \nthe measurement time acts as an additional low frequency roll-off. \nThe plot in Figure 6 uses a slightly different technique: an FFT-\nbased instrument (Figure 35) is used to generate a 10 Hz brickwall filter. A low frequency pole at 0.1 Hz is generated with an external ac coupling capacitor, which is also the instrument being \ndc coupled. \nSeveral precautions are necessary to attain optimum low \nfrequency noise performance: \n\uf0b7 Care must be used to account for the effects of R S. Even  \na 10 Ω resistor has 0.4 nV/√Hz of noise (an error of 9% when root sum squared with 0.9 nV/√Hz). \n\uf0b7 The test setup must be fully warmed up to prevent e OS drift \nfrom erroneously contributing to input noise. \n\uf0b7 Circuitry must be shielded from air currents. Heat flow out \nof the package through its leads creates the opportunity for \na thermoelectric potential at every junction of different metals. Selective heating and cooling of these by random air currents appears as 1/f noise and obscures the true device noise. \n\uf0b7 The results must be interpreted using valid statistical techniques. \n7\n462\n3HP 3465\nDYNAMIC SIGNALANALYZER\n(10Hz)1\nΩ100kΩ\n**\nVOUT+VS\n–VS1.5µF\nAD797\n00846-034 *USE THE POWER SUPPLY BYPASSING SHOWN IN FIGURE 36.  \nFigure 35. Test Setup for Measuring 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz Noise \nWIDEBAND NOISE \nDue to its single-stage design, the noise of the AD797 is flat \nover frequencies from less than 10 Hz to beyond 1 MHz. This  \nis not true of most dc precision amplifiers, where second-stage noise contributes to input-referred noise beyond the audio frequency range. The AD797 offers new levels of performance in wideband imaging applications. In sampled data systems, where aliasing of out-of-band noise into the signal band is a problem, the AD797 outperforms all previously available IC op amps.  \n \n \n \nData Sheet AD797\n \nRev. K | Page 13 of 19 BYPASSING CONSIDERATIONS \nTaking full advantage of the very wide bandwidth and dynamic \nrange capabilities of the AD797  requires some precautions. \nFirst, multiple bypassing is recommended in any precision \napplication. A 1.0 μF to 4.7 μF tantalum in parallel with 0.1 μF \nceramic bypass capacitors are sufficient in most applications. \nWhen driving heavy loads, a larger demand is placed on the supply bypassing. In this case, selective use of larger values of tantalum capacitors and damping of their lead inductance with small-value (1.1 Ω to 4.7 Ω) carbon resistors can achieve an improvement. Figure 36 summarizes power supply bypassing recommendations.  \nUSE SHORT\nLEAD LENGTHS(<5mm)KELVIN RETURN\nLOAD\nCURRENTOR\n0.1µFVS VS\n4.7µF\n00846-035USE SHORTLEAD LENGTHS(<5mm)KELVIN RETURN\nLOADCURRENT0.1µF 4.7µF TO 22.0µF\n1.1ΩTO 4.7Ω\n \nFigure 36. Recommended Power Supply Bypassing \nTHE NONINVERTING CONFIGURATION \nUltralow noise requires very low values of the internal parasitic \nresistance (r BB) for the input transistors (≈6 Ω). This implies \nvery little damping of input and output reactive interactions. With the AD797, additional input series damping is required \nfor stability with direct output to input feedback. A 100 Ω \nresistor (R1) in the inverting input (see Figure 37) is sufficient; the 100 Ω balancing resistor (R2) is recommended but is not required for stability. The noise penalty is minimal (e\nNtotal ≈ \n2.1 nV/√Hz), which is usually insignificant.  \n7\n43R2\n100ΩR1\n100Ω\n**\nVOUT\nVIN+VS\n–VSAD797\n00846-036RL\n600Ω62\n*USE THE POWER SUPPLY BYPASSING SHOWN IN FIGURE 35.  \nFigure 37.

Alternative Voltage Follower Connection \nLow noise preamplification is usually performed in the non-\ninverting mode (see Figure 39). For lowest noise, the equivalent resistance of the feedback network should be as low as possible. \nThe 30 mA minimum drive current of the AD797 makes it easier \nto achieve this. The feedback resistors can be made as low as \npossible, with consideration to load drive and power consumption. \n7\n**\nVOUT\nVIN+VS\n–VSAD797\n00846-038RLCL\nR2\nR1\n62\n34\n*USE THE POWER SUPPLY BYPASSING SHOWN IN FIGURE 35.  \nFigure 39. Low Noise Preamplifier \nTable 6 provides some representative values for the AD797 when \nused as a low noise follower. Operation on 5 V supplies allows the use of a 100 Ω or less feedback network (R1 + R2). Because the AD797 shows no unusual behavior when operating near its \nmaximum rated current, it is suitable for driving the AD600/ \nAD602 (see Figure 51) while preserving low noise performance. \nOptimum flatness and stability at noise gains >1 sometimes require \na small capacitor (C\nL) connected across the feedback resistor (R1 of \nFigure 39). Table 6 includes recommended values of C L for several \ngains. In general, when R2 is greater than 100 Ω and C L is greater \nthan 33 pF, a 100 Ω resistor should be placed in series with C L. \nSource resistance matching is assumed, and the AD797 should not \nbe operated with unbalanced source resistance >200 kΩ/G. \nTable 6.

The input signal was obtained from a resonant reed switch pulse generator, available from Tektronix as calibration Fixture No. 067-0608-00. When open, the switch is simply 50 Ω to ground and settling is purely \na passive pulse decay and inherently flat. The low repetition rate \nsignal was captured on a digital oscilloscope after being amplified and clamped twice.

Settling Time Test Circuit \nDISTORTION REDUCTION \nThe AD797 has distortion performance (THD < −120 dB,  \nat 20 kHz, 3 V rms, R L = 600 Ω) unequaled by most voltage \nfeedback amplifiers. \nAt higher gains and higher frequencies, THD increases due to a \nreduction in loop gain. However, in contrast to most conven-\ntional voltage feedback amplifiers, the AD797 provides two \neffective means of reducing distortion as gain and frequency  \nare increased: cancellation of the distortion of the output stage and gain bandwidth enhancement by decompensation. By applying these techniques, gain bandwidth can be increased to \n450 MHz at G = 1000, and distortion can be held to −100 dB at \n20 kHz for G = 100. \nThe unique design of the AD797 provides cancellation of the \noutput stage’s distortion. To achieve this, a capacitance equal to \nthe effective compensation capacitance, usually 50 pF, is connected between Pin 8 and the output (see C2 in Figure 45). Use of this feature improves distortion performance when the closed-loop \ngain is more than 10 or when frequencies of interest are greater \nthan 30 kHz. \nBandwidth enhancement via decompensation is achieved by \nconnecting a capacitor from Pin 8 to ground (see C1 in Figure 45). Adding C1 results in subtracting from the value of the internal compensation capacitance (50 pF), yielding a smaller effective \ncompensation capacitance and therefore a larger bandwidth.  The benefits of adding C1 are evident for closed-loop gains  \nof ≥100. A maximum value of ≈33 pF at gains of ≥1000 is \nrecommended. At a gain of 1000, the bandwidth is 450 kHz. \nTable 8 and Figure 46 summarize the performance of the \nAD797 with distortion cancellation and decompensation. \nVIN\na.\nb.AD797\n00846-04450pFR1\nR2\nR2\nC1, SEE TABLE\nC2 = 50pF – C162\n3\nVINAD797C2\nC1R1\n62\n38\n8\nVOUT\n \nFigure 45.
