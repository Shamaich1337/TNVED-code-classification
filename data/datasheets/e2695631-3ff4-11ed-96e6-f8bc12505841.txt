INTRODUCTION\nThe MR5A16A is a 33,554,432-bit magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) device organized as \n2,097,152 words of 16 bits. The MR5A16A offers SRAM compatible 35 ns read/write timing (45ns for au -\ntomotive temperature option) with unlimited endurance. Data is always non-volatile for greater than 20 \nyears. Data is automatically protected on power loss by low-voltage inhibit circuitry to prevent writes with \nvoltage out of specification.  To simplify fault tolerant design, the MR5A16A includes internal single bit \nerror correction code with 7 ECC parity bits for every 64 data bits.  The MR5A16A is the ideal memory solu -\ntion for applications that must permanently store and retrieve critical data and programs quickly.\nThe MR5A16A   is available in a small footprint 48-pin ball grid array (BGA) package and a 54-pin thin small \noutline package (TSOP Type 2).

Functional operation \nshould be restricted to recommended operating conditions. Exposure to excessive voltages or magnetic \nfields could affect device reliability.\n2  All voltages are referenced to VSS. The DC value of VIN must not exceed actual applied VDD  by more than \n0.5V. The AC value of VIN must not exceed applied  VDD by more than 2V for 10ns with  IIN limited to less than \n20mA.\n3 Power dissipation capability depends on package characteristics and use environment.Table 2.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings 1MR5A16A\nMR5A16A  Rev v1.0   11/20197\nCopyright © 2019 Everspin Technologies, Inc.

As soon as VDD exceeds VDD(min), \nthere is a startup time of 2 ms before read or write operations can start. This time allows memory power \nsupplies to stabilize. \nThe E and W control signals should track VDD on power up to VDD- 0.2 V or VIH (whichever is lower) and remain \nhigh for the startup time. In most systems, this means that these signals should be pulled up with a resis -\ntor so that a signal remains high if the driving signal is Hi-Z during power up. Any logic that drives E and W \nshould hold the signals high with a power-on reset signal for longer than the startup time. \nDuring power loss or brownout where VDD goes below VWI, writes are protected and a startup time must be \nobserved when power returns above VDD(min).\nFigure 2.1  Power Up and Power Down DiagramMR5A16A Electrical Specifications\nBROWNOUT or  POWER LOSS\nNORMAL\n OPERATIONVDD\nREAD/WRITE \nINHIBITEDVWI\n2 ms\nREAD/WRITE \nINHIBITED\nVIH STARTUP\nNORMAL\n OPERATION2 ms\nE\nWRECOVER\nVIH \nMR5A16A  Rev v1.0   11/20198\nCopyright © 2019 Everspin Technologies, Inc.

#### Description:
The **MR5A16ACYS35** is a 32Mb (33,554,432 bits) magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) device organized as 2,097,152 words of 16 bits. It is designed to provide fast read/write operations with SRAM-compatible timing, making it suitable for applications requiring quick access to non-volatile memory. The device features a low-voltage inhibit circuitry that protects data during power loss and includes error correction capabilities to enhance reliability.

#### Typical Applications:
The MR5A16ACYS35 is ideal for applications that require permanent storage of critical data and programs, such as:
- **Embedded Systems:** Where non-volatile memory is essential for storing firmware and configuration settings.
- **Industrial Automation:** For data logging and control systems that need to retain information during power outages.
- **Consumer Electronics:** In devices that require fast access to stored data without the need for battery backup.
- **Automotive Applications:** Suitable for automotive electronics that operate in harsh environments and require reliable data retention.

This component effectively replaces traditional memory types like FLASH, SRAM, EEPROM, and NVSRAM, simplifying design and improving overall system reliability.
