The noise\nimmunity level and reliability of CAN transceivers can beeasily increased by adding external surge protection diodesto prevent transient voltage failures.\nThe NUP2105L provides a surge protection solution for\nCAN data communication lines. The NUP2105L is a dualbidirectional surge protection device in a compactSOT−23 package. This device is based on Zener technology\nthat optimizes the active area of a PN junction to provide\nrobust protection against transient EMI surge voltage andESD. The NUP2105L has been tested to EMI and ESD\nlevels that exceed the specifications of popular high speedCAN networks.\nCAN Physical Layer Requirements\nTable 1 provides a summary of the system requirements\nfor a CAN transceiver. The ISO 11898 −2 physical layer\nspecification forms the baseline for most CAN systems. The\ntransceiver requirements for the Honeywell® Smart\nDistribution Systems (SDS®) and Rockwell\n(Allen−Bradley) DeviceNet ™ high speed CAN networks\nare similar to ISO 11898 −2. The SDS and DeviceNet\ntransceiver requirements are similar to ISO 1 1898−2;\nhowever, they include minor modifications required in anindustrial environment.\nTable 1.

The ISO 7637 −2\nspecification is used to define the susceptibility to coupled\ntransient noise on a 12 V power supply, while ISO 7637 −3\ndefines the noise immunity tests for data lines. The ISO 7637\ntests also verify the robustness and reliability of a design by\napplying the surge voltage for extended durations.\nThe IEC 61000 −4−X specifications can also be used to\nquantify the EMI immunity level of a CAN system. The IEC61000−4 and ISO 7637 tests are similar; however, the IEC\nstandard was created as a generic test for any electronicsystem, while the ISO 7637 standard was designed for\nvehicular applications. The IEC61000 −4−4 Electrical Fast\nTransient (EFT) specification is similar to the ISO 7637 −3\npulse 3a and b tests and is a requirement of SDS CANsystems. The IEC 61000 −4−5 test is used to define the power\nabsorption capacity of a surge protection device and longduration voltage transients such as lightning. Table 2provides a summary of the ISO 7637 and IEC 61000 −4−X\ntest specifications. Table 3 provides the NUP2105L’s ESD\ntest results.\nTable 2.
