If the feedback voltage is below the reference, the high-side MOSFET \nis turned on for a fixed ON-time determined by a programming resistor R ON. RON is connected to V IN such that \nON-time is reduced with increasing input supply voltage. Following this ON-time, the high-side MOSFET remains \noff for a minimum of 260 ns. If the voltage on the feedback pin falls below the reference level again the ON-time \ncycle is repeated. Regulation is achieved in this manner.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n0.47 PF\n15 PH\nCoCINCvccCBST\nFBEN\nSSVin\nLinear reg\nRON\nTimerCss\nRON\nRFBT\nRFBBCFF\nRegulator ICVO\nInternal \nPassivesVOUT\nGNDVIN 1\n23\n45\n67RENT\nRENB\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Output Overvoltage Comparator\nThe voltage at FB is compared to a 0.92-V internal reference. If FB rises above 0.92 V the ON-time is \nimmediately terminated. This condition is known as overvoltage protection (OVP). It can occur if the input voltage \nis increased very suddenly or if the output load is decreased very suddenly. Once OVP is activated, the top \nMOSFET ON-times will be inhibited until the condition clears. Additionally, the synchronous MOSFET will remain \non until inductor current falls to zero.\n7.3.2 Current Limit\nCurrent limit detection is carried out during the OFF-time by monitoring the current in the synchronous MOSFET. \nReferring to the Section 7.2, when the top MOSFET is turned off, the inductor current flows through the load, \nthe PGND pin and the internal synchronous MOSFET. If this current exceeds the I CL value, the current limit \ncomparator disables the start of the next ON-time period. The next switching cycle will occur only if the FB input \nis less than 0.8 V and the inductor current has decreased below I CL. Inductor current is monitored during the \nperiod of time the synchronous MOSFET is conducting. So long as inductor current exceeds I CL, further ON-time \nintervals for the top MOSFET will not occur. Switching frequency is lower during current limit due to the longer \nOFF-time.\nNote\nThe DC current limit varies with duty cycle, switching frequency, and temperature.\n7.3.3 Thermal Protection\nThe junction temperature of the LMZ14201H should not be allowed to exceed its maximum ratings. Thermal \nprotection is implemented by an internal Thermal Shutdown circuit which activates at 165 °C (typical) causing \nthe device to enter a low power standby state. In this state the main MOSFET remains off causing V O to fall, and www.ti.comLMZ14201H\nSNVS690I – JANUARY 2011 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: LMZ14201H\nadditionally the CSS capacitor is discharged to ground. Thermal protection helps prevent catastrophic failures for \naccidental device overheating. When the junction temperature falls back below 145 °C (typical Hyst = 20 °C) the \nSS pin is released, V O rises smoothly, and normal operation resumes.\n7.3.4 Zero Coil Current Detection\nThe current of the lower (synchronous) MOSFET is monitored by a zero coil current detection circuit which \ninhibits the synchronous MOSFET when its current reaches zero until the next ON-time. This circuit enables the \nDCM operating mode, which improves efficiency at light loads.\n7.3.5 Prebiased Start-Up\nThe LMZ14201H will properly start up into a prebiased output. This startup situation is common in multiple rail \nlogic applications where current paths may exist between different power rails during the startup sequence. The \nprebias level of the output voltage must be less than the input UVLO set point. This will prevent the output \nprebias from enabling the regulator through the high-side MOSFET body diode.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Discontinuous Conduction and Continuous Conduction Modes\nAt light-load, the regulator will operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). With load currents above the \ncritical conduction point, it will operate in continuous conduction mode (CCM). When operating in DCM the \nswitching cycle begins at zero amps inductor current; increases up to a peak value, and then recedes back to \nzero before the end of the OFF-time. During the period of time that inductor current is zero, all load current is \nsupplied by the output capacitor. The next ON-time period starts when the voltage on the FB pin falls below the \ninternal reference. The switching frequency is lower in DCM and varies more with load current as compared to \nCCM. Conversion efficiency in DCM is maintained because conduction and switching losses are reduced with \nthe smaller load and lower switching frequency.LMZ14201H\nSNVS690I – JANUARY 2011 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMZ14201H\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

The enable input also incorporates 90 mV (typical) of \nhysteresis resulting in a falling threshold of 1.09 V. The maximum recommended voltage into the EN pin is 6.5 \nV. For applications where the midpoint of the enable divider exceeds 6.5 V, a small Zener diode can be added to \nlimit this voltage.\nThe function of the R ENT and R ENB divider shown in the Section 7.2 is to allow the designer to choose an input \nvoltage below which the circuit will be disabled. This implements the feature of programmable undervoltage \nlockout. This is often used in battery-powered systems to prevent deep discharge of the system battery. It is also \nuseful in system designs for sequencing of output rails or to prevent early turnon of the supply as the main input \nvoltage rail rises at power up. Applying the enable divider to the main input rail is often done in the case of higher \ninput voltage systems such as 24-V AC/DC systems where a lower boundary of operation should be established. \nIn the case of sequencing supplies, the divider is connected to a rail that becomes active earlier in the power-up \ncycle than the LMZ14201H output rail. The two resistors should be chosen based on the following ratio:\nRENT / RENB = (V IN-ENABLE / 1.18 V) – 1 (1)\nThe EN pin is internally pulled up to VIN and can be left floating for always-on operation. However, it is good \npractice to use the enable divider and turn on the regulator when V IN is close to reaching its nominal value. This \nwill ensure smooth start-up and will prevent overloading the input supply.\n8.2.2.1.2 Output Voltage Selection\nOutput voltage is determined by a divider of two resistors connected between V O and ground. The midpoint of \nthe divider is connected to the FB input. The voltage at FB is compared to a 0.8-V internal reference. In normal \noperation an ON-time cycle is initiated when the voltage on the FB pin falls below 0.8 V. The high-side MOSFET \nON-time cycle causes the output voltage to rise and the voltage at the FB to exceed 0.8 V. As long as the \nvoltage at FB is above 0.8 V, ON-time cycles will not occur.\nThe regulated output voltage determined by the external divider resistors R FBT and R FBB is:\nVO = 0.8 V × (1 + R FBT / RFBB) (2)\nRearranging terms; the ratio of the feedback resistors for a desired output voltage is:\nRFBT / RFBB = (V O / 0.8 V) - 1 (3)\nThese resistors should be chosen from values in the range of 1 kΩ to 50 kΩ.\nA feed-forward capacitor is placed in parallel with R FBT to improve load step transient response. Its value is \nusually determined experimentally by load stepping between DCM and CCM conduction modes and adjusting for \nbest transient response and minimum output ripple.\nA table of values for R FBT , RFBB , and R ON is included in the simplified applications schematic.\n8.2.2.1.3 Soft-Start Capacitor, C SS, Selection\nProgrammable soft-start permits the regulator to slowly ramp to its steady-state operating point after being \nenabled, thereby reducing current inrush from the input supply and slowing the output voltage rise-time to \nprevent overshoot.\nUpon turnon, after all UVLO conditions have been passed, an internal 8uA current source begins charging the \nexternal soft-start capacitor. The soft-start time duration to reach steady-state operation is given by the formula:LMZ14201H\nSNVS690I – JANUARY 2011 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMZ14201H\ntSS = V REF × C SS / Iss = 0.8 V × C SS / 8 uA (4)\nThis equation can be rearranged as follows:\nCSS = tSS × 8 μA / 0.8 V (5)\nUse of a 4700-pF capacitor results in 0.5-ms soft-start duration. This is a recommended value. Note that \nhigh values of C SS capacitance will cause more output voltage droop when a load transient goes across the \nDCM-CCM boundary. Use Equation 18  below to find the DCM-CCM boundary load current for the specific \noperating condition. If a fast load transient response is desired for steps between DCM and CCM mode the \nsoft-start capacitor value should be less than 0.018 µF.\nNote that the following conditions will reset the soft-start capacitor by discharging the SS input to ground with an \ninternal 200-μA current sink:\n•The enable input being “pulled low”\n•Thermal shutdown condition\n•Overcurrent fault\n•Internal V IN UVLO\n8.2.2.1.4 Output Capacitor, C O, Selection\nNone of the required output capacitance is contained within the module. At a minimum, the output capacitor \nmust meet the worst-case RMS current rating of 0.5 × I LR P-P , as calculated in Equation 19 . Beyond that, \nadditional capacitance will reduce output ripple so long as the ESR is low enough to permit it. A minimum value \nof 10 μF is generally required. Experimentation will be required if attempting to operate with a minimum value. \nLow-ESR capacitors, such as ceramic and polymer electrolytic capacitors are recommended.\n8.2.2.1.4.1 Capacitance\nEquation 6  provides a good first pass approximation of C O for load transient requirements:\nCO≥ ISTEP × V FB × L × V IN/ (4 × V O × (V IN — V O) × V OUT-TRAN ) (6)\nAs an example, for 1A load step, V IN = 24 V, V OUT = 12 V, V OUT-TRAN  = 50 mV:\nCO≥ 1 A × 0.8 V × 15 μH × 24 V / (4 × 12 V × ( 24 V – 12 V) × 50 mV)\nCO≥ 10.05 μF\n8.2.2.1.4.2 ESR\nThe ESR of the output capacitor affects the output voltage ripple. High ESR will result in larger V OUT peak-\nto-peak ripple voltage. Furthermore, high output voltage ripple caused by excessive ESR can trigger the \novervoltage protection monitored at the FB pin. The ESR should be chosen to satisfy the maximum desired \nVOUT peak-to-peak ripple voltage and to avoid overvoltage protection during normal operation. The following \nequations can be used:\nESR MAX-RIPPLE  ≤ V OUT-RIPPLE  / ILR P-P (7)\nwhere\n•ILR P-P  is calculated using Equation 19  below.\nESR MAX-OVP  < (V FB-OVP  - VFB) / (I LR P-P  × A FB ) (8)\nwhere\n•AFB is the gain of the feedback network from V OUT to V FB at the switching frequency.\nAs worst-case, assume the gain of A FB with the C FF capacitor at the switching frequency is 1.www.ti.comLMZ14201H\nSNVS690I – JANUARY 2011 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: LMZ14201H\nThe selected capacitor should have sufficient voltage and RMS current rating. The RMS current through the \noutput capacitor is:\nI(COUT(RMS) ) = I LR P-P  / √12 (9)\n8.2.2.1.5 Input Capacitor, C IN, Selection\nThe LMZ14201H module contains an internal 0.47 µF input ceramic capacitor. Additional input capacitance is \nrequired external to the module to handle the input ripple current of the application. This input capacitance \nshould be as close as possible to the module. Input capacitor selection is generally directed to satisfy the input \nripple current requirements rather than by capacitance value.\nWorst-case input ripple current rating is dictated by Equation 10 :\nI(CIN(RMS) ) ≊ 1 / 2 × I O × √ (D / 1-D) (10)\nwhere\n•D ≊ VO / VIN\n(As a point of reference, the worst-case ripple current will occur when the module is presented with full load \ncurrent and when V IN = 2 × V O).\nRecommended minimum input capacitance is 10-uF X7R ceramic with a voltage rating at least 25% higher than \nthe maximum applied input voltage for the application. TI also recommends to pay attention to the voltage and \ntemperature deratings of the capacitor selected. Also note ripple current rating of ceramic capacitors may be \nmissing from the capacitor data sheet and you may have to contact the capacitor manufacturer for this rating.\nIf the system design requires a certain maximum value of input ripple voltage ΔVIN to be maintained then \nEquation 11  may be used.\nCIN ≥ IO × D × (1–D) / f SW-CCM  × ΔV IN (11)\nIf ΔV IN is 1% of V IN for a 24-V input to 12-V output application this equals 240 mV and f SW = 400 kHz.\nCIN≥ 1 A × 12 V/24 V × (1– 12 V/24 V) / (400000 × 0.240 V)\nCIN≥ 2.6 μF\nAdditional bulk capacitance with higher ESR may be required to damp any resonant effects of the input \ncapacitance and parasitic inductance of the incoming supply lines.\n8.2.2.1.6 ON-Time, R ON, Resistor Selection\nMany designs will begin with a desired switching frequency in mind. As seen in the Typical Characteristics \nsection, the best efficiency is achieved in the 300 kHz to 400 kHz switching frequency range. Equation 12  can be \nused to calculate the R ON value.\nfSW(CCM)  ≊ VO / (1.3 × 10-10 x R ON) (12)\nThis can be rearranged as\nRON ≊ VO / (1.3 × 10-10 x fSW(CCM) (13)\nThe selection of R ON and f SW(CCM)  must be confined by limitations in the ON-time and OFF-time for the COT \nControl Circuit Overview  section.\nThe ON-time of the LMZ14201H timer is determined by the resistor R ON and the input voltage V IN. It is \ncalculated as follows:\ntON = (1.3 × 10-10 × R ON) / V IN (14)LMZ14201H\nSNVS690I – JANUARY 2011 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMZ14201H\nThe inverse relationship of t ON and V IN gives a nearly constant switching frequency as V IN is varied. R ON should \nbe selected such that the ON-time at maximum V IN is greater than 150 ns. The ON-timer has a limiter to ensure \na minimum of 150 ns for t ON. This limits the maximum operating frequency, which is governed by Equation 15 :\nfSW(MAX)  = V O / (V IN(MAX)  × 150 nsec) (15)\nThis equation can be used to select R ON if a certain operating frequency is desired so long as the minimum \nON-time of 150 ns is observed. The limit for R ON can be calculated as follows:\nRON ≥ V IN(MAX)  × 150 nsec / (1.3 × 10-10) (16)\nIf R ON calculated in Equation 13  is less than the minimum value determined in Equation 16  a lower frequency \nshould be selected. Alternatively, V IN(MAX)  can also be limited in order to keep the frequency unchanged.\nAdditionally, the minimum OFF-time of 260 ns (typical) limits the maximum duty ratio. Larger R ON (lower F SW) \nshould be selected in any application requiring large duty ratio.\n8.2.2.1.6.1 Discontinuous Conduction and Continuous Conduction Mode Selection\nOperating frequency in DCM can be calculated as follows:\nfSW(DCM)  ≊ VO × (V IN-1) × 15 μH × 1.18 × 1020 × IO / ((V IN–VO) × R ON 2) (17)\nIn CCM, current flows through the inductor through the entire switching cycle and never falls to zero during the \nOFF-time. The switching frequency remains relatively constant with load current and line voltage variations. The \nCCM operating frequency can be calculated using Equation 12  above.\nThe approximate formula for determining the DCM/CCM boundary is as follows:\nIDCB ≊ VO × (V IN–VO) / ( 2 × 15 μH × f SW(CCM)  × V IN) (18)\nThe inductor internal to the module is 15 μH. This value was chosen as a good balance between low and high \ninput voltage applications. The main parameter affected by the inductor is the amplitude of the inductor ripple \ncurrent (I LR).

The resistance of the input supply rail should be low enough that an input current transient does not \ncause a high enough drop at the LMZ14201H supply voltage that can cause a false UVLO fault triggering and \nsystem reset. If the input supply is more than a few inches from the LMZ14201H, additional bulk capacitance \nmay be required in addition to the ceramic bypass capacitors. The amount of bulk capacitance is not critical, but \na 47-μF or 100-μF electrolytic capacitor is a typical choice.LMZ14201H\nSNVS690I – JANUARY 2011 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMZ14201H\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nPCB layout is an important part of DC-DC converter design. Poor board layout can disrupt the performance of a \nDC-DC converter and surrounding circuitry by contributing to EMI, ground bounce and resistive voltage drop in \nthe traces. These can send erroneous signals to the DC-DC converter resulting in poor regulation or instability. \nGood layout can be implemented by following a few simple design rules.\n1.Minimize area of switched current loops.\nFrom an EMI reduction standpoint, it is imperative to minimize the high di/dt paths during PCB layout. The \nhigh current loops that do not overlap have high di/dt content that will cause observable high frequency noise \non the output pin if the input capacitor (Cin1) is placed at a distance away from the LMZ14203. Therefore \nplace C IN1 as close as possible to the LMZ14203 VIN and GND exposed pad. This will minimize the high \ndi/dt area and reduce radiated EMI. Additionally, grounding for both the input and output capacitor should \nconsist of a localized top side plane that connects to the GND exposed pad (EP).\n2.Have a single point ground.\nThe ground connections for the feedback, soft-start, and enable components should be routed to the GND \npin of the device. This prevents any switched or load currents from flowing in the analog ground traces. If \nnot properly handled, poor grounding can result in degraded load regulation or erratic output voltage ripple \nbehavior. Provide the single point ground connection from pin 4 to EP.\n3.Minimize trace length to the FB pin.\nBoth feedback resistors, R FBT and R FBB, and the feed forward capacitor C FF, should be close to the FB pin. \nSince the FB node is high impedance, maintain the copper area as small as possible. The trace are from \nRFBT, RFBB, and C FF should be routed away from the body of the LMZ14203 to minimize noise.\n4.Make input and output bus connections as wide as possible.\nThis reduces any voltage drops on the input or output of the converter and maximizes efficiency. To optimize \nvoltage accuracy at the load, ensure that a separate feedback voltage sense trace is made to the load. \nDoing so will correct for voltage drops and provide optimum output accuracy.\n5.Provide adequate device heat-sinking.\nUse an array of heat-sinking vias to connect the exposed pad to the ground plane on the bottom PCB layer. \nIf the PCB has a plurality of copper layers, these thermal vias can also be employed to make connection to \ninner layer heat-spreading ground planes. For best results use a 6 × 6 via array with minimum via diameter \nof 8 mils thermal vias spaced 59 mils (1.5 mm). Ensure enough copper area is used for heat-sinking to keep \nthe junction temperature below 125°C.\n10.1.1 Power Module SMT Guidelines\nThe recommendations below are for a standard module surface mount assembly\n•Land Pattern – Follow the PCB land pattern with either soldermask defined or non-soldermask defined pads\n•Stencil Aperture\n–For the exposed die attach pad (DAP), adjust the stencil for approximately 80% coverage of the PCB land \npattern\n–For all other I/O pads use a 1:1 ratio between the aperture and the land pattern recommendation\n•Solder Paste – Use a standard SAC Alloy such as SAC 305, type 3 or higher\n•Stencil Thickness – 0.125 mm to 0.15 mm\n•Reflow - Refer to solder paste supplier recommendation and optimized per board size and density\n•Refer to AN Design Summary LMZ1xxx and LMZ2xxx Power Modules Family  (SNAA214 ) for Reflow \ninformation\n•Maximum number of reflows allowed is onewww.ti.comLMZ14201H\nSNVS690I – JANUARY 2011 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: LMZ14201H\nFigure 10-1.
