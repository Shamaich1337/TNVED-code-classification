Users should check for and obtain the latest relevant information and verify that such information is current and \ncomplete before placing orders for Bourns® products.\nThe characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® product set forth in its data sheet are based on laboratory conditions, and \nstatements regarding the suitability of products for certain types of applications are based on Bourns’  knowledge of typical \nrequirements in generic applications.  The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® product in a user application may vary \nfrom the data sheet characteristics and parameters due to (i) the combination of the Bourns® product with other components \nin the user’s application, or (ii) the environment of the user application itself.  The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® \nproduct also can and do vary in different applications and actual performance may vary over time.  Users should always verify \nthe actual performance of the Bourns® product in their specific devices and applications, and make their own independent \njudgments regarding the amount of additional test margin to design into their device or application to compensate for  \ndifferences between laboratory and real world conditions.\nUnless Bourns has explicitly designated an individual Bourns® product as meeting the requirements of a particular industry \nstandard (e.g., ISO/TS 16949) or a particular qualification (e.g., UL  listed or recognized), Bourns is not responsible for any \nfailure of an individual Bourns® product to meet the requirements of such industry standard or particular qualification.  Users of \nBourns® products are responsible for ensuring compliance with safety-related requirements and standards applicable to their \ndevices or applications.\nBourns® products are not recommended, authorized or intended for use in nuclear , lifesaving, life-critical or life-sustaining ap -\nplications, nor in any other applications where failure or malfunction may result in personal injury , death, or severe property or \nenvironmental damage.  Unless expressly and specifically approved in writing by two authorized Bourns representatives on a \ncase-by-case basis, use of any Bourns® products in such unauthorized applications might not be safe and thus is at the user ’s \nsole risk.  Life-critical applications include devices identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as Class III devices and \ngenerally equivalent classifications outside of the United States.\nBourns expressly identifies those Bourns® standard products that are suitable for use in automotive applications on such  \nproducts’ data sheets in the section entitled “Applications.”  Unless expressly and specifically approved in writing by two  \nauthorized Bourns representatives on a case-by-case basis, use of any other Bourns® standard products in an automotive \napplication might not be safe and thus is not recommended, authorized or intended and is at the user ’s sole risk.  If Bourns \nexpressly identifies a sub-category of automotive application in the data sheet for its standard products (such as infotainment \nor lighting), such identification means that Bourns has reviewed its standard product and has determined that if such Bourns® \nstandard product is considered for potential use in automotive applications, it should only be used in such sub-category of \nautomotive applications.  Any reference to Bourns® standard product in the data sheet as compliant with the AEC-Q standard \nor “automotive grade” does not by itself mean that Bourns has approved such product for use in an automotive application.\nBourns® standard products are not tested to comply with United States Federal Aviation Administration standards generally \nor any other generally equivalent governmental organization standard applicable to products designed or manufactured for \nuse in aircraft or space applications. Bourns expressly identifies Bourns® standard products that are suitable for use in aircraft \nor space applications on such products’ data sheets in the section entitled “Applications.”  Unless expressly and specifically \napproved in writing by two authorized Bourns representatives on a case-by-case basis, use of any other Bourns® standard \nproduct in an aircraft or space application might not be safe and thus is not recommended, authorized or intended and is at the \nuser’s sole risk.\nThe use and level of testing applicable to Bourns® custom products shall be negotiated on a case-by-case basis by Bourns and \nthe user for which such Bourns® custom products are specially designed.  Absent a written agreement between Bourns and the \nuser regarding the use and level of such testing, the above provisions applicable to Bourns® standard products shall also apply \nto such Bourns® custom products.\nUsers shall not sell, transfer, export or re-export any Bourns® products or technology for use in activities which involve the \ndesign, development, production, use or stockpiling of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or missiles, nor shall they use \nBourns® products or technology in any facility which engages in activities relating to such devices.  The foregoing restrictions \napply to all uses and applications that violate national or international prohibitions, including embargos or international  \nregulations.  Further, Bourns® products and Bourns technology and technical data may not under any circumstance be  \nexported or re-exported to countries subject to international sanctions or embargoes.  Bourns® products may not, without prior \nauthorization from Bourns and/or the U.S. Government, be resold, transferred, or re-exported to any party not eligible  \nto receive U.S. commodities, software, and technical data.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Bourns disclaims (i) any and all liability for special, punitive, consequential, \nincidental or indirect damages or lost revenues or lost profits, and (ii) any and all implied warranties, including implied warranties \nof fitness for particular purpose, non-infringement and merchantability .\nFor your convenience, copies of this Legal Disclaimer Notice with German, Spanish, Japanese, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese \nbilingual versions are available at:\n  Web Page: http://www.bourns.com/legal/disclaimers-terms-and-policies\n           PDF: http://www.bourns.com/docs/Legal/disclaimer.pdf\nC1753 05/17/18R\nMouser Electronics\n  \nAuthorized Distributor\n \n  \nClick to View Pricing, Inventory, Delivery & Lifecycle Information:\n \n \n \n Bourns:   \n\xa0 PVG3A104C01R00\xa0 PVG3A205C01R00\xa0 PVG3G201C01R00\xa0 PVG3G501C01R00\xa0 PVG3A501C01R00\xa0\nPVG3A103C01R00\xa0 PVG3A101C01R00\xa0 PVG3A200C01R00\xa0 PVG3A500C01R00\xa0 PVG3A100C01R00\xa0\nPVG3A105C01R00\xa0 PVG3A201C01R00\xa0 PVG3A202C01R00\xa0 PVG3A203C01R00\xa0 PVG3A204C01R00\xa0\nPVG3A502C01R00\xa0 PVG3A503C01R00\xa0 PVG3A504C01R00\xa0 PVG3G100C01R00\xa0 PVG3G102C01R00\xa0\nPVG3G105C01R00\xa0 PVG3G200C01R00\xa0 PVG3G202C01R00\xa0 PVG3G203C01R00\xa0 PVG3G204C01R00\xa0\nPVG3G205C01R00\xa0 PVG3G500C01R00\xa0 PVG3G502C01R00\xa0 PVG3G503C01R00\xa0 PVG3G504C01R00\xa0\nPVG3A102C01R00\xa0 PVG3G104C01R00\xa0 PVG3G101C01R00\xa0 PVG3G103C01R00\xa0 PVG3G224C01R00\xa0\nPVG3K102C01R00\xa0 PVG3A224C01R00\xa0 PVG3K100C01R00\xa0 PVG3K101C01R00\xa0 PVG3K105C01R00\xa0\nPVG3K200C01R00\xa0 PVG3K503C01R00\xa0 PVG3K504C01R00\xa0 PVG3K201C01R00\xa0 PVG3K202C01R00\xa0\nPVG3K203C01R00\xa0 PVG3K204C01R00\xa0 PVG3K500C01R00\xa0 PVG3K501C01R00\xa0 PVG3K205C01R00\xa0\nPVG3K502C01R00\xa0 PVG3K104C01R00\xa0 PVG3K103C01R00\n'}]
