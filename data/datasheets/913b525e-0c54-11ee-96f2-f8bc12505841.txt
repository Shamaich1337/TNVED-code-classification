T hese  comparator s are exceptionally \nversatile and easy to use. F eatures include an input range from \nGND  − 0.5 V to VCC + 0.2  V , low noise , TTL -/CMOS -compatible \noutput drivers, and latch inputs with adjustable hysteresis \nand/or shutdown input s.  \nThe device offers 5  ns propagation delay with 10  mV overdrive \non 3  mA typical supply current.  \nA flexible power su pply scheme allows th e device s to operate \nwith a single +2.5 V positive supply and a − 0.5 V to +2.8 V \ninput signal range up to a +5.5 V positive supply with a −0.5 V \nto +5.8  V input signal range. Split i nput/output supplies with no \nsequencing restrictions on the ADCMP602 support a wide input signal range while still allowing i ndependent output \nswing control and power savings. \nThe TTL -/CMOS -compatible output stage is designed to drive \nup to 5 p F with full timing specs and to degrade in a graceful \nand linear fashion as additional capacitance is added. The \ncomparator input stage offers robust protection against large \ninput overdrive, and the outputs do not phase reverse when the \nvalid input signal  range is exceeded. L atch and programmable \nhysteresis features ar e also provided with a uniq ue single -pin \ncontrol option.  \nThe ADCMP600 is available in 5-lead SC70 and S OT-23 \npackages , the ADCMP601 is available in a 6 -lead SC70 package, \nand the ADCMP602 is available in an 8 -lead MSOP package.   \n \nRev.

A | Page 10 of 16 APPLICATION INFORMAT ION \nPOWER/GROUND LAYOUT AND BYPASSING  \nThe ADCMP600/ADCMP601/ADCMP602  comparator s are very \nhigh speed devices . Despite the low noise output stage, it is essential \nto use proper high speed design techniques to achieve the specified \nperformance. Because comparators are uncompensated amplifiers, feedback in any phase relationship is likely t o cause oscillations or \nundesired hysteresis. Of critical importance is the use of low impedance supply planes, particularly the output supply plane (V\nCCO) and the ground plane (GND). Individual supply planes are \nrecommended as part of a multilayer board. Providing the lowest \ninductance return path for switching currents ensures the best possible performance in the target application.  \nIt is also important to adequately bypass the input and output \nsupplies. Multiple high quality 0.01 µF bypass capacitors sh ould \nbe placed as close as possible to each of the V\nCCI and VCCO supply \npins and should be connected to the GND plane with redundant vias. At least one of these should be placed to provide a physically short return path for output currents flowing back fro m ground \nto the V\nCC pin. Hi gh frequency bypass capacitors should be \ncarefully selected for minimum inductance and ESR. Parasitic \nlayout inductance should also be strictly controlled to maximize \nthe effectiveness of the bypass at high frequencies.  \nIf the  package allows and the  input and output supplies have \nbeen connected separately such that VCCI ≠ VCCO, care should be \ntaken to bypass each of these supplies separatel y to the GND \nplane. A bypass capacitor should never be connected between \nthem. It is recommended that the GND plane separate the VCCI \nand VCCO planes when the circuit board layout is d esigned to \nminimize coupling between the two supplies and to take \nadvantage of the additional bypass capacitance from each respective supply to the ground plane. This enhances the performance when split input/output supplies  are used. If the \ninput and outp ut supplies are connected together for single -supply \noperation such that V\nCCI = VCCO, coupling between the two supplies \nis unavoidable; however, careful board placement can help keep output return currents away from the inputs.  \nTTL -/CMOS -COMPATIBLE  OUTPUT STAGE  \nSpecified propagation delay performance can be achieved only by keeping the capacitive load at or below the specified minimums. The outputs of the devices  are designed to directly drive one \nSchottky TTL or three low power S chottky TTL loads or the \nequivalent. For large fan outputs, bus es, or transmission lines, \nuse an appropriate buffer to maintain th e excellent speed and \nstability  of the comparator . \nWith the rated 5 pF load capacitance applied, more than half of the total device propagation delay is output stage slew time, even at 2.5 V V\nCC. Because of this, the total prop delay decreases \nas VCCO decreases, and instability in the power supply may \nappear  as excess delay dispersion. This delay is measure d to the 50% point for the supply in use ; \ntherefore,  the fastest times are  observed with the VCC supply at \n2.5 V , and larger values are  observed when driving loads that  \nswitch at other levels.  \nWhen duty cycle accuracy is critical, the logic being driven should switch at 50% of V\nCC and load capacitance sh ould be \nminimized. When in doubt, it is best to power VCCO or the \nentire device from the logic supply and rely on the input PSRR and CMRR to reject noise.  \nOverdrive and input slew rate dispersions are not significantly \naffected by output loading and V\nCC variations.  \nThe TTL -/CMOS -compatible output stage is shown in the \nsimplified schematic diagram ( Figure 17). Because of its \ninherent symmetry and generally good behavior, this output \nstage is readily adaptable for driving various fi lters and other \nunusual loads.  \nOUTPUT\nQ2Q1\n+IN\n–IN\nOUTPUT STAGEVLOGIC\nGAIN STAGEA2A1\nAV\n05914-014 \nFigure 17. Simplified Schematic Diagram of  \nTTL -/CMOS -Compatible Output Stage  \nUSING/DISABLING THE LATCH FEATURE  \nThe latch input is designed for maximum versatility. It can safely be left floating for fixed hysteresis or be tied to V\nCC to \nremove the hysteresis, or it can be  driven low by any standard \nTTL/ CMOS device as a high speed latch.  \nIn addition, the pin can be operated as a hysteresis control pin with a bias voltage of 1.25 V nominal and an inp ut resistance of \napproximately 7000 Ω . This allows the comparator hysteresis to \nbe easily and accurately controlled by either a resistor or an \ninexpensive CMOS DAC.  \nHysteresis control and latch mode can be used together if an open drain, an open collector , or a three -state driver is connected \nparallel to the hysteresis control resistor or current source.  \nDue to the programmable hysteresis feature, the logic threshold \nof the latch pin is approximately 1.1 V regardless of V\nCC. \n ADCMP600/ADCMP601/ADCMP602\n \nRev. A | Page 11 of 16 OPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE \nAs with any high speed comparator, proper design and layout \ntechniques are essential for obtaining the specified performance. \nStray capacitance, inductance, inductive power and ground impedances, or other layout issues can severely limit performance \nand often cause oscillation. Large discontinuities along input \nand output transmission lines can also limit the specified pulse-width dispersion performance. The source impedance should be minimized as much as is practicable. High source impedance, in combination with the parasitic input capacitance of the comparator, causes an undesirable degradation in bandwidth at \nthe input, thus degrading the overall response. Thermal noise \nfrom large resistances can easily cause extra jitter with slowly slewing input signals; higher impedances encourage undesired \ncoupling.  \nCOMPARATOR PROPAGATION DELAY \nDISPERSION \nThe ADCMP600/ADCMP601/ADCMP602 comparators are \ndesigned to reduce propagation delay dispersion over a wide \ninput overdrive range. Propagation delay dispersion is the \nvariation in propagation delay that results from a change in the degree of overdrive or slew rate (that is, how far or how fast the \ninput signal exceeds the switching threshold).  \nPropagation delay dispersion is a specification that becomes \nimportant in high speed, time-critical applications, such as data communication, automatic test and measurement, and instru-\nmentation. It is also important in event-driven applications, such \nas pulse spectroscopy, nuclear instrumentation, and medical imaging. Dispersion is defined as the variation in propagation delay as the input overdrive conditions are changed (Figure 18 \nand Figure 19).  \nThe device dispersion is typically < 2 ns as the overdrive varies \nfrom 10 mV to 125 mV . This specification applies to both \npositive and negative signals because the device has very closely \nmatched delays both positive-going and negative-going inputs.  \nQ/Q OUTPUTINPUT VOLTAGE500mV OVERDRIVE\n10mV OVERDRIVE\nDISPERSIONVN ± VOS\n05914-015 \nFigure 18.

Propagation Delay—Slew Rate Dispersion \nCOMPARATOR HYSTERESIS \nThe addition of hysteresis to a comparator is often desirable in a \nnoisy environment, or when the differential input amplitudes \nare relatively small or slow moving. Figure 20 shows the transfer function for a comparator with hysteresis. As the input voltage approaches the threshold (0.0 V , in this example) from below the threshold region in a positive direction, the comparator \nswitches from low to high when the input crosses +V\nH/2, and the \nnew switching threshold becomes −V H/2. The comparator remains \nin the high state until the new threshold, −V H/2, is crossed from \nbelow the threshold region in a negative direction. In this manner, \nnoise or feedback output signals centered on 0.0 V input cannot \ncause the comparator to switch states unless it exceeds the region \nbounded by ±V H/2. \nOUTPUT\nINPUT 0VOLVOH\n+VH\n2–VH\n2\n05914-017 \nFigure 20. Comparator Hysteresis Transfer Function \nThe customary technique for introducing hysteresis into a \ncomparator uses positive feedback from the output back to the \ninput. One limitation of this approach is that the amount of hysteresis varies with the output logic levels, resulting in hysteresis that is not symmetric about the threshold. The external feedback network can also introduce significant parasitics that reduce high speed performance and induce oscillation in some cases. \nThese ADCMP600 features a fixed hysteresis of approximately  \n2 mV . The ADCMP601 and ADCMP602 comparators offer a programmable Hysteresis feature that can significantly improve accuracy and stability. Connecting an external pull-down resistor or a current source from the LE/HYS pin to GND, varies the amount of hysteresis in a predictable, stable manner. \nADCMP600/ADCMP601/ADCMP602  \n \nRev. A | Page 12 of 16 Leaving the LE/H YS pin disconnected results in a fixed \nhyster esis of 2 mV; driving this pin high removes hysteresis. The \nmaximum hysteresis that can be a pplied using this pin is \napproximately 160 m V.  Figure 21 illustrates the amount of \nhysteresis applied as a function of the external resistor value, \nand Figure 11 illustrates hysteresis as a function of the current.  \nThe hysteresis control pin appears as a 1.25 V bias voltage seen through a series resistance of 7 k Ω. The bias voltage changes \n± 20% throughout the hys teresis control range.  The advantages \nof applying hysteresis in this manner are improved accuracy, \nimproved stability, reduced component count, and maximum versatility. An external bypass capacitor is not recommended on the HYS  pin because it impairs the l atch function and often \ndegrades the jitter performance of the device. As described in the \nUsing/Disabling the Latch Feature  section, hysteresis control \nneed not compromise the latch function.  \nCROSSOVER BIAS POINT  \nIn both op amp s and comparators, rail -to-rail inputs of this type \nhave a dual front -end design. Certain devices are active near the \nVCC rail and others are active near the GND  rail. At some prede ter-\nmined point in the common -mode range, a crossover occurs. At \nthis point , normally VCC/2, the direction of the bias current reverses \nand the measured offset voltages and currents change.  \nThe ADCMP600/ADCMP601/ADCMP602 comparators \nslightly elaborate  on this sche me. Crossover points can be  found \nat approximately 0.8  V and 1.6  V .  \n 0\n50 150 250 450 350 550 65050100150200250\n05914-030HYSTERESIS (mV)\nHYSTERESIS RESISTOR (k Ω)VCC= 5.5V\nVCC= 2.5V\n \nFigure 21.
