Application  \nThe LEDs described here are intended to be used for ordinary electronic equipment (such as office \nequipment, communication equipment and household applications).Consult Liteon’s Sales in advance \nfor information on applications in which exceptional reliabil ity is required, particularly when the failure \nor malfunction of the LEDs may directly jeopardize life or health (such as in aviation, transportation, \ntraffic control equipment, medical and life support systems and safety devices).   \n2. Storage  \nThe package is sealed:  \n  The LEDs should be stored at 30°C or less and 90%RH or less. And the LEDs are limited to use within  \none year, while the LEDs is packed in moisture -proof package with the desiccants inside.  \nThe package is opened:  \nThe storage ambient for the LE Ds should not exceed 30°C temperature or 60% relative humidity.  \nIt is recommended that LEDs out of their original packaging are IR -reflowed within one week . \nFor extended storage out of their original packaging, it is recommended that the LEDs be stored in a \nsealed container with appropriate desiccant, or in a desiccators with nitrogen ambient.  \nLEDs stored out of their original packaging for more than one week  should be baked at about 60 deg C \nfor at least 2 0 hours before solder assembly.   \n3. Cleaning  \nUse a lcohol -based cleaning solvents such as isopropyl alcohol to clean the LED if necessary.   \n4.

Drive Method  \nAn LED is a current -operated device. In order to ensure intensity uniformity on multiple LEDs connected \nin parallel in an application, it is recommended that a current limiting resistor be incorporated in the \ndrive circuit, in series with each LED as shown in Circuit A below.  \n Circuit model A                      Circuit model B  \n          \nLED                 \nLED  \n(A) Recommended circuit.  \n(B) The brightness of each LED might appear different due to the differences in the I -V characteris tics \nof those LEDs.   \n6. ESD (Electrostatic Discharge)  \nStatic Electricity or power surge will damage the LED.  \nSuggestions to prevent ESD damage:   \n\uf06e Use of a conductive wrist band or anti -electrostatic  glove when handling these LEDs.  \n\uf06e All devices, equipment, a nd machinery must be properly grounded.  \n\uf06e Work tables, storage racks, etc. should be properly grounded.  \n\uf06e Use ion blower to neutralize the static charge which might have built up on surface of the LED’s \nplastic lens as a result of friction between LEDs during storage and handling.  \n \nESD -damaged LEDs will exhibit abnormal characteristics such as high reverse leakage current, low forward \nvoltage, or “ no lightup ” at low currents.  \nTo verify for ESD damage, check for “ lightup ” and Vf of the suspect LEDs at low cu rrents.  \nThe Vf of “ good ” LEDs should be >2.0V@0.1mA for InGaN product and >1.4V@0.1mA for AlInGaP product.      \n LITE -ON  TECHNOLOGY  CORPORATION  \nSamLi20120117 \nP r o p e r t y  o f  L i t e -O n  O n l y  \n \n \n7.
