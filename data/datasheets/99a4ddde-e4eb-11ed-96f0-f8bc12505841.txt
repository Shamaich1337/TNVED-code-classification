The device incorporates a battery input and maintains accurate timekeeping when main power to the device is interrupted. The integration of the microelec -\ntromechanical systems (MEMS) resonator enhances the long-term accuracy of the device and reduces the piece-part count in a manufacturing line.\nThe RTC maintains seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, \nmonth, and year information. The date at the end of the month is automatically adjusted for months with fewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap year. The clock operates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator. Two programmable time-of-day alarms and a 1Hz output are provided. Address and data are transferred serially through an I\n2C bidirectional bus. \nA precision temperature-compensated voltage reference and comparator circuit monitors the status of V\nCC to \ndetect power failures, to provide a reset output, and to automatically switch to the backup supply when neces -\nsary. Additionally, the RST pin is monitored as a pushbut -\nton input for generating a microprocessor reset.

This pin should be decoupled using a 0.1 FF to 1.0FF capacitor. \nConnect to ground if not used.\n3INT/ \nSQWActive-Low Interrupt or 1Hz Square-Wave Output. This open-drain pin requires an external pullup resistor connected to a supply at 4.5V or less. It can be left open if not used. This multifunction pin is determined by the state of the INTCN bit in the Control register (0Eh). When INTCN is set to logic 0, this pin outputs a 1Hz square wave. When INTCN is set to logic 1, a match between the timekeeping registers and either of the alarm registers activates the INT/SQW pin (if the alarm is enabled). Because the INTCN bit is set to \nlogic 1 when power is first applied, the pin defaults to an interrupt output with alarms disabled.\n4 RSTActive-Low Reset. This pin is an open-drain input/output. It indicates the status of V\nCC relative to the V PF \nspecification. As V CC falls below V PF, the RST pin is driven low. When V CC exceeds V PF, for t RST, the \nRST pin is pulled high by the internal pullup resistor. The active-low, open-drain output is combined with a debounced pushbutton input function. This pin can be activated by a pushbutton reset request. It has an internal 50kI (R\nPU) nominal value pullup resistor to V CC. No external pullup resistors should be con -\nnected. If the oscillator is disabled, t REC is bypassed and RST immediately goes high.\n5 GND Ground\n6 VBATBackup Power-Supply Input. When using the device with the V BAT input as the primary power source, this \npin should be decoupled using a 0.1 FF to 1.0F F low-leakage capacitor. When using the device with the V BAT \ninput as the backup power source, the capacitor is not required. If V BAT is not used, connect to ground. The \ndevice is UL recognized to ensure against reverse charging when used with a primary lithium battery.

The oscillator pro -\nvides a stable and accurate reference clock and main -\ntains the RTC to within Q0.432 seconds-per-day accu-\nracy from -40 NC to +85 NC. The RTC is a low-power clock/\ncalendar with two programmable time-of-day alarms. INT/\nSQW provides either an interrupt signal due to alarm conditions or a 1Hz square wave. The clock/calendar provides seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and year information. The date at the end of the month is auto -\nmatically adjusted for months with fewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap year. The clock operates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour format with an AM/PM indi-\ncator. The internal registers are accessible though an I 2C \nbus interface. A temperature-compensated voltage refer-ence and comparator circuit monitors the level of V\nCC to \ndetect power failures and to automatically switch to the backup supply when necessary. The RST pin provides \nan external pushbutton function and acts as an indica -\ntor of a power-fail event. Also available are 236 bytes of general-purpose battery-backed SRAM.\nOperation\nThe Block Diagram shows the device’s main elements. \nEach of the major blocks is described separately in the following sections.Block Diagram\nDS3232M\nN\nNTIME-BASE\nRESONATOR\nTEMP\nSENSORINTERRUPT\nOR 1Hz\nSELECTDIVIDER\nINT/SQW\n1Hz\nDIGITAL\nADJUSTMENT\nFACTORY TRIMN32KHZ\nGND\nSDA\nSCLVBAT\nVCC\nRST\nCLOCK/CALENDAR\nWITH ALARMCONTROL AND STATUS\nREGISTERS\nSRAMI2C\nINTERFACEPOWER\nCONTROL*P*SELECTED\nPOWER\nDS3232M\n±5ppm, I 2C Real-Time Clock with SRAM   10\nMaxim IntegratedHigh-Accuracy Time Base\nThe temperature sensor, oscillator, and digital adjust-\nment controller logic form the highly accurate time base. The controller reads the output of the on-board tempera -\nture sensor and adjusts the final 1Hz output to maintain the required accuracy. The device is trimmed at the factory to maintain a tight accuracy over the operating temperature range. When the device is powered by V\nCC, \nthe adjustment occurs once a second. When the device is powered by V\nBAT, the adjustment occurs once every \n10s to conserve power. Adjusting the 1Hz time base less often does not affect the device’s long-term timekeeping accuracy. The device also contains an Aging Offset reg -\nister that allows a constant offset (positive or negative) to be added to the factory-trimmed adjustment value.\nPower-Supply Configurations\nThe DS3232M can be configured to operate on a single power supply (using either V\nCC or V BAT) or in a dual-\nsupply configuration, which provides a backup supply source to keep the timekeeping circuits alive during absence of primary system power.\nFigure 4 illustrates a single-supply configuration using \nV\nCC only, with the V BAT input grounded. When V CC < VPF, \nthe RST output is asserted (active low). Temperature con -\nversions are executed once per second.\nFigure 5 illustrates a single-supply configuration using \nVBAT only, with the V CC input grounded. The RST output \nis disabled and is held at ground through the connection of the internal pullup resistor. Temperature conversions are executed once every 10s.\nFigure 6 illustrates a dual-supply configuration, using \nthe V\nCC supply for normal system operation and the \nVBAT supply for backup power. In this configuration, the \npower-selection function is provided by a temperature-compensated voltage reference and a comparator circuit that monitors the V\nCC level. When V CC is greater than \nVPF, the device is powered by V CC. When V CC is less \nthan V PF but greater than V BAT, the device is powered \nby V CC. If V CC is less than V PF and is less than V BAT, the \ndevice is powered by V BAT (see Table 1).\nWhen V CC < V PF, the RST output is asserted (active \nlow). When V CC is the presently selected power source, \ntemperature conversions are executed once per second. When V\nBAT is the presently selected power source, tem -\nperature conversions are executed once every 10s.Figure 4. Single Supply (V CC Only)\nFigure 5. Single Supply (V BAT Only)\nFigure 6.

Power Control\nTo preserve the battery, the first time V BAT is applied \nto the device the oscillator does not start up until V CC \nexceeds V PF or until a valid I 2C address is written to \nthe device. Typical oscillator startup time is less than \n1s. Approximately 2s after V CC is applied, or a valid \nI2C address is written, the device makes a temperature \nmeasurement and applies the calculated correction to the oscillator. Once the oscillator is running, it continues to run as long as a valid power source is available (V\nCC \nor VBAT), and the device continues to measure the tem-\nperature and correct the oscillator frequency. On the first application of V\nCC power, or (if V BAT powered) when a \nvalid I 2C address is written to the device, the time and \ndate registers are reset to 01/01/00 01 00:00:00 (DD/MM/YY DOW HH:MM:SS).\nV\nBAT Operation\nThere are several modes of operation that affect the amount of V\nBAT current that is drawn. While the device \nis powered by V BAT and the serial interface is active, \nthe active battery current I BATA  is drawn. When the \nserial interface is inactive, the timekeeping current I BATT  \n(which includes the averaged temperature-conversion current I\nBATTC ) is used. The temperature-conversion \ncurrent I BATTC  is specified since the system must be \nable to support the periodic higher current pulse and still maintain a valid voltage level. The data-retention current I\nBATDR  is the current drawn by the device when the oscillator is stopped ( EOSC = 1). This mode can be \nused to minimize battery requirements for periods when maintaining time and date information is not necessary, e.g., while the end system is waiting to be shipped to a customer.\nPushbutton Reset Function\nThe device provides for a pushbutton switch to be con -\nnected to the RST input/output pin. When the device is not in a reset cycle, it continuously monitors RST for a low-going edge. If an edge transition is detected, the device debounces the switch by pulling RST low. After the internal timer has expired (PB\nDB), the device con-\ntinues to monitor the RST line. If the line is still low, the \ndevice continuously monitors the line looking for a rising edge. Upon detecting release, the device forces RST \nlow and holds it low for t\nRST. RST is also used to indi -\ncate a power-fail condition. When V CC is lower than V PF, \nan internal power-fail signal is generated, which forces RST low. When V\nCC returns to a level above V PF, RST \nis held low for approximately 250ms (t REC) to allow the \npower supply to stabilize. If the oscillator is not running when V\nCC is applied, t REC is bypassed and RST imme-\ndiately goes high. Assertion of the RST output, whether \nby pushbutton or power-fail detection, does not affect \nthe device’s internal operation. RST output operation and \npushbutton monitoring are only available if V CC power is \navailable.CONFIGURATION CONDITION I/O ACTIVE I/O INACTIVE RST\nVCC Only\n(Figure 4)VCC > V PFICCA ICCSInactive (High)\nVCC < V PF Active (Low)\nVBAT Only\n(Figure 5)EOSC = 0IBATAIBATTDisabled (Low)\nEOSC = 1 IBATDR\nDual Supply\n(Figure 6)VCC > V PF ICCA ICCS Inactive (High)\nVCC < V PFVCC > V BAT ICCA VCC > V BAT ICCSActive (Low)\nVCC < V BAT IBATA VCC < V BAT IBATT\nDS3232M\n±5ppm, I 2C Real-Time Clock with SRAM   12\nMaxim IntegratedReal-Time Clock (RTC)\nWith the 1Hz source from the temperature-compensated \noscillator, the RTC provides seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and year information. The date at the end of the month is automatically adjusted for months with fewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap year. The clock operates in either the 24-hour or the 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator. The clock pro -\nvides two programmable time-of-day alarms. INT/SQW can be enabled to generate either an interrupt due to an alarm condition or a 1Hz square wave. This selection is controlled by the INTCN bit in the Control register.\nI2C Interface\nThe I 2C interface is accessible whenever either V CC or \nVBAT is at a valid level. If a microcontroller connected \nto the device resets because of a loss of V CC or other \nevent, it is possible that the microcontroller and device’s I\n2C communications could become unsynchronized, \ne.g., the microcontroller resets while reading data from the device. When the microcontroller resets, the device’s I\n2C interface can be placed into a known state by tog -\ngling SCL until SDA is observed to be at a high level. At that point the microcontroller should pull SDA low while SCL is high, generating a START condition.\nSRAM\nThe DS3232M provides 236 bytes of general-purpose battery-backed read/write memory. The I\n2C address \nranges from 14h–FFh. The SRAM can be written or read whenever V\nCC or V BAT is greater than the minimum oper -\nating voltage.\nAddress Map\nTable 2 shows the address map for the device’s time -\nkeeping registers. During a multibyte access, when the address pointer reaches the end of the register space (12h), it wraps around to location 00h. On an I\n2C START or address pointer incrementing to location 00h, the current time is transferred to a second set of registers. The time information is read from these sec -\nondary registers, while the clock can continue to run. This eliminates the need to reread the registers in case the main registers update during a read.\nClock and Calendar\nThe time and calendar information is obtained by reading the appropriate register bytes. Table 2 shows the RTC \nregisters. The time and calendar data are set or initialized by writing the appropriate register bytes. The contents of the time and calendar registers are in the binary-coded decimal (BCD) format. The device can be run in either 12-hour or 24-hour mode. Bit 6 of the Hours register is defined as the 12-hour or 24-hour mode select bit. When high, the 12-hour mode is selected. In the 12-hour mode, bit 5 is the AM/PM bit with logic-high being PM. In the \n24-hour mode, bit 5 is the 20-hour bit (20–23 hours). The century bit (bit 7 of the Month register) is toggled when the Years register overflows from 99 to 00. The day-of-week register increments at midnight. Values that correspond to the day of week are user-defined but must be sequential (i.e., if 1 equals Sunday, then 2 equals Monday, and so on). Illogical time and date entries result in undefined operation. When reading or writing the time and date registers, secondary buffers are used to prevent errors when the internal registers update. When reading the time and date registers, the secondary buffers are synchronized to the internal registers on any I\n2C START \nand when the register pointer rolls over to zero. The time information is read from these secondary registers, while the clock continues to run. This eliminates the need to reread the registers in case the main registers update during a read. The countdown chain is reset whenever the seconds register is written. Write transfers occur on the acknowledge from the device. Once the countdown chain is reset, to avoid rollover issues the remaining time and date registers must be written within 1s.\nDS3232M\n±5ppm, I 2C Real-Time Clock with SRAM   13\nMaxim IntegratedTable 2.

Alarm 2 can be set by writing to registers 0Bh–0Dh. See Table 2. The alarms can be programmed (by the \nalarm enable and INTCN bits in the Control register) to activate the INT/SQW output on an alarm match condition. Bit 7 of each of the time-of-day/date alarm registers are mask bits (Table 2). When all the mask bits for each alarm are logic 0, an alarm only occurs when the values in the timekeeping registers match the corresponding values stored in the time-of-day/date alarm registers. The alarms can also be programmed to repeat every second, minute, hour, day, or date. Table 3 shows the possible settings. Configurations not listed in the table result in illogical operation. The DY/DT bits (bit 6 of the alarm day/date registers) con-trol whether the alarm value stored in bits 0–5 of that register reflects the day of the week or the date of the month. If DY/DT is written to logic 0, the alarm is the result of a match with date of the month. If DY/ DT is \nwritten to logic 1, the alarm is the result of a match with day of the week. When the RTC register values match alarm register settings, the corresponding alarm flag A1F or A2F bit is set to logic 1. If the correspond -\ning alarm interrupt enable A1IE or A2IE bit is also set to logic 1, the alarm condition activates the INT/SQW \nsignal if the INTCN bit is set to logic 1. The match is tested on the once-per-second update of the time and date registers.\nTable 3.

When set to logic 0, the oscillator is started. When set to logic 1, the oscillator is \nstopped when the device switches to V BAT. This bit is clear (logic 0) when power is first applied. When the \ndevice is powered by V CC, the oscillator is always on regardless of the status of the EOSC bit. When the oscil -\nlator is disabled, all register data is static.\nBIT 6BBSQW: Battery-backed square-wave enable. When set to logic 1 with INTCN = 0  and V CC < V PF, this bit \nenables the 1Hz square wave. When BBSQW is logic 0, INT/SQW goes high impedance when V CC falls below \nVPF. This bit is disabled (logic 0) when power is first applied.\nBIT 5CONV: Convert temperature. Setting this bit to 1 forces the temperature sensor to convert the temperature into digital code and execute the temperature compensate algorithm to update the oscillator’s accuracy. The device cannot be forced to execute the temperature-compensate algorithm faster than once per second. A user-initiated temperature conversion does not affect the internal update cycle. The CONV bit remains at a 1 from the time it is written until the temperature conversion is completed, at which time both CONV and BSY go to 0. The CONV bit should be used when monitoring the status of a user-initiated conversion. See Figure 7 for more details.\nBITS 4:3 NA: Not applicable. These bits have no affect on the device and can be set to either 0 or 1.\nBIT 2INTCN: Interrupt control. This bit controls the INT/SQW output signal. When the INTCN bit is set to logic 0, a \n1Hz square wave is output on INT/SQW. When the INTCN bit is set to logic 1, a match between the timekeep -\ning registers and either of the alarm registers activates the  INT/SQW output (if the alarm is also enabled). The \ncorresponding alarm flag is always set regardless of the state of the INTCN bit. The INTCN bit is set to a logic 1 when power is first applied.\nBIT 1A2IE: Alarm 2 interrupt enable. When set to logic 1, this bit permits the alarm 2 flag (A2F) bit in the status reg -\nister to assert INT/SQW (when INTCN = 1). When the A2IE bit is set to logic 0 or INTCN is set to logic 0, the \nA2F bit does not initiate an interrupt signal. The A2IE bit is disabled (logic 0) when power is first applied.\nBIT 0A1IE: Alarm 1 interrupt enable. When set to logic 1, this bit permits the alarm 1 flag (A1F) bit in the status reg -\nister to assert INT/SQW (when INTCN = 1). When the A1IE bit is set to logic 0 or INTCN is set to logic 0, the \nA1F bit does not initiate an interrupt signal.

This bit is set to logic 1 any time that the oscillator stops. This bit remains at logic 1 until written to logic 0. The following are examples of  \nconditions that can cause the OSF bit to be set:1) The first time power is applied.2) The voltages present on both V\nCC and V BAT are insufficient to support the oscillator.\n3) The EOSC bit is turned off in battery-backed mode.\n4) External influences on the oscillator (i.e., noise, leakage, etc.).\nBIT 6BB32KHZ: Battery-backed 32kHz output (BB32KHZ). This bit enables the 32kHz output when the device is pow -\nered from V BAT (provided the 32kHz output is enabled with the EN32KHZ bit).

On initial power-up, this bit is set to a logic 1 and the 32KHZ output is enabled and produces a 32.768kHz square wave if the oscillator is enabled.\nBIT 2BSY:\n Busy. This bit indicates the device is busy executing temperature conversion function. It goes to logic 1 \nwhen the conversion signal to the temperature sensor is asserted, and then it is cleared when the device has completed the temperature conversion. See the Block Diagram for more details.\nBIT 1A2F: Alarm 2 flag. A logic 1 in the alarm 2 flag bit indicates that the time matched the alarm 2 registers. If the A2IE bit is logic 1 and the INTCN bit is set to logic 1, INT/SQW is also asserted. A2F is cleared when written to \nlogic 0. This bit can only be written to logic 0. Attempting to write to logic 1 leaves the value unchanged.\nBIT 0A1F: Alarm 1 flag. A logic 1 in the alarm 1 flag bit indicates that the time matched the alarm 1 registers.

For example, 00011001 01b = +25.25°C. Upon power reset, the registers are set to a default temperature of 0°C and the controller starts a temperature conversion. The temperature is read upon initial applica -\ntion of V\nCC or I2C access on V BAT and once every second afterwards with V CC power or once every 10s with V BAT power.

The first byte \nsent to the device includes the device identifier, device address, and the R/W bit (Figure 9). The device address sent by the I 2C master must match the address assigned \nto the device.\nI2C Definitions\nThe following terminology is commonly used to describe I2C data transfers.\nMaster Device: The master device controls the slave devices on the bus. The master device generates SCL clock pulses and START and STOP conditions.\nSlave Devices: Slave devices send and receive data \nat the master’s request.\nBus Idle or Not Busy: Time between STOP and \nSTART conditions when both SDA and SCL are inac -\ntive and in their logic-high states. When the bus is idle, it often initiates a low-power mode for slave devices.\nSTART Condition: A START condition is generated \nby the master to initiate a new data transfer with a slave. Transitioning SDA from high to low while SCL remains high generates a START condition. See Figure 1 for applicable timing.\nSTOP Condition: A STOP condition is generated \nby the master to end a data transfer with a slave. Transitioning SDA from low to high while SCL remains high generates a STOP condition. See Figure 1 for \napplicable timing.\nRepeated START Condition: The master can use \na repeated START condition at the end of one data transfer to indicate that it immediately initiates a new data transfer following the current one. Repeated STARTs are commonly used during read operations to identify a specific memory address to begin a data transfer. A repeated START condition is issued identi -\ncally to a normal START condition. See Figure 1 for \napplicable timing.\nBit Write: Transitions of SDA must occur during \nthe low state of SCL. The data on SDA must remain valid and unchanged during the entire high pulse of SCL plus the setup and hold time requirements (see Figure 1). Data is shifted into the device during the rising edge of the SCL.\nBit Read: At the end of a write operation, the master \nmust release the SDA bus line for the proper amount of setup time (see Figure 1) before the next rising \nedge of SCL during a bit read. The device shifts out each bit of data on SDA at the falling edge of the pre -\nvious SCL pulse and the data bit is valid at the rising edge of the current SCL pulse. Remember that the master generates all SCL clock pulses including when it is reading bits from the slave.\nAcknowledge (ACK and NACK):  An acknowledge \n(ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) is always the ninth \nbit transmitted during a byte transfer. The device receiving data (the master during a read or the slave during a write operation) performs an ACK by trans -\nmitting a 0 during the ninth bit. A device performs a NACK by transmitting a 1 during the ninth bit. Timing for the ACK and NACK is identical to all other bit writes. An ACK is the acknowledgment that the device is properly receiving data. A NACK is used to terminate a read sequence or as an indication that the device is not receiving data.\nByte Write: A byte write consists of 8 bits of informa-\ntion transferred from the master to the slave (most significant bit first) plus a 1-bit acknowledgment from the slave to the master. The 8 bits transmitted by the master are done according to the bit write definition and the acknowledgment is read using the bit read definition.\nByte Read: A byte read is an 8-bit information transfer \nfrom the slave to the master plus a 1-bit ACK or NACK from the master to the slave. The 8 bits of information that are transferred (most significant bit first) from the slave to the master are read by the master using the bit read definition, and the master transmits an ACK using the bit write definition to receive additional data bytes. The master must NACK the last byte read to terminate communication so the slave returns control of SDA to the master.\nFigure 9.

The slave address byte contains the slave address in the most significant 7 bits and the R/W bit in the least significant bit. The device’s slave address is D0h and cannot be modi -\nfied by the user. When the R/ W bit is 0 (such as in \nD0h), the master is indicating it writes data to the slave. If R/W = 1 (D1h in this case), the master is indicating it wants to read from the slave. If an incor-rect slave address is written, the device assumes the master is communicating with another I 2C device and \nignore the communication until the next START condi -\ntion is sent.\nMemory Address: During an I 2C write operation, the \nmaster must transmit a memory address to identify \nthe memory location where the slave is to store the data. The memory address is always the second byte transmitted during a write operation following the slave address byte.I2C Communication\nSee Figure 10 for an I 2C communication example.\nWriting a Single Byte to a Slave:  The master must \ngenerate a START condition, write the slave address byte (R/W = 0), write the memory address, write the byte of data, and generate a STOP condition. Remember the master must read the slave’s acknowl -\nedgment during all byte write operations.\nWriting Multiple Bytes to a Slave:  To write multiple \nbytes to a slave, the master generates a START con -\ndition, writes the slave address byte (R/ W = 0), writes \nthe starting memory address, writes multiple data \nbytes, and generates a STOP condition.\nReading a Single Byte from a Slave:  Unlike the write \noperation that uses the specified memory address \nbyte to define where the data is to be written, the read operation occurs at the present value of the memory address counter. To read a single byte from the slave, the master generates a START condition, writes the \nFigure 10.

However, since requir-ing the master to keep track of the memory address counter is impractical, use the method for manipulat -\ning the address counter for reads.\nManipulating the Address Counter for Reads:  A \ndummy write cycle can be used to force the address \ncounter to a particular value. To do this the mas -\nter generates a START condition, writes the slave address byte (R/ W = 0), writes the memory address \nwhere it desires to read, generates a repeated START condition, writes the slave address byte (R/W = 1), reads data with ACK or NACK as applicable, and generates a STOP condition. See Figure 6 for a read \nexample using the repeated START condition to specify the starting memory location.\nReading Multiple Bytes from a Slave: The read \noperation can be used to read multiple bytes with a single transfer. When reading bytes from the slave, the master simply ACKs the data byte if it desires to read another byte before terminating the transaction. After the master reads the last byte it must NACK to indicate the end of the transfer and then it generates a STOP condition.\nApplications Information\nPower-Supply Decoupling\nTo achieve the best results when using the DS3232M, decouple the V\nCC and/or V BAT power supplies with \n0.1FF and/or 1.0 FF capacitors. Use a high-quality, \nceramic, surface-mount capacitor if possible. Surface-mount components minimize lead inductance, which improves performance, and ceramic capacitors tend to have adequate high-frequency response for decoupling applications.\nIf communications during battery operation are not \nrequired, the V\nBAT decoupling capacitor can be omitted.Using Open-Drain Outputs\nThe INT/SQW output is open drain and requires an exter -\nnal pullup resistor to realize logic-high output level. Pullup resistor values between 1k I and 10MI  are typical.\nThe RST output is also open drain, but is provided with \nan internal 50kI pullup resistor (R\nPU) to V CC. External \npullup resistors should not be added.\nSDA and SCL Pullup Resistors\nSDA is an open-drain output and requires an external pullup resistor to realize a logic-high level.\nBecause the device does not use clock cycle stretching, \na master using either an open-drain output with a pullup resistor or CMOS output driver (push-pull) could be used for SCL.\nBattery Charge Protection\nThe device contains Maxim’s redundant battery-charge protection circuit to prevent any charging of the external battery.\nOrdering Information\nPackage Information\nFor the latest package outline information and land patterns (foot -\nprints), go to www.maximintegrated.com/packages.
