The stereo audio ADCs and DACs support sample rates \nfrom 8 kHz to 96 kHz as well as a digital volume control. The ADAU1361 is ideal for battery -powered audio and telephony \napplications.  \nThe record path includes an integrated microphone bias circuit \nand six inputs. The inputs can be mixed and muxed before the \nADC, or they can be configured to bypass the ADC. The \nADAU1361 includes a stereo digital microphone input.  \nThe ADAU1361 includes five high power output drivers  (two \ndifferential and three single -ended) , supporting stereo head -\nphones, an earpiece , or other output transducer. AC -coupled  \nor capless configurations are supported. Individual fine level \ncontrols are supported on all analog out puts. The output mixer \nstage allows for flexible routing of audio.  \nThe serial control bus supports the I\n2C and SPI protocol s. The \nserial audio bus is programmable for I2S, left -/right -justified, \nand TDM modes. A programmable PLL supports flexible clock generation for all standard integer rates and fractional master \nclocks from 8  MHz to 27 MHz . \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM  \nHP JACK\nDETECTIONREGULATOR\nINPUT\nMIXERS\nALC\nMICROPHONE\nBIASPLLLINNLINPLAUXJACKDET/MICIN\nRINP\nRINN\nRAUX\nMICBIASLHPLOUTNLOUTPADAU1361\nRHPMONOOUT\nROUTP\nROUTNCM\nIOVDDDGND\nDVDDOUT\nAGNDAVDDAVDD\nAGND\nOUTPUT\nMIXERSDAC\nDIGITAL\nFILTERSADC\nDIGITAL\nFILTERSDAC\nDAC ADCADC\nSDA/\nCOUTI2C/SPI\nCONTROL PORTSERIAL DATA\nINPUT/OUTPUT PORTS\nMCLK ADC_SDATA\nBCLKSCL/\nCCLKADDR1/\nCDATAADDR0/\nCLATCHLRCLKDAC_SDATA\n07679-001 \nFigure 1. \nADAU1361 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

D | Page 23 of 80 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe ADAU1361 is an audio codec that offer s high quality audio, \nlow power, and small package size . The stereo ADC and stereo \nDAC each have an SNR of at least + 98 dB and a THD  + N of  \nat least −9 0 dB. The serial data port is compatible with I2S, left -\njustified, right- justified, and TDM modes for interfacing to digital  \naudio data. The operating voltage range is 1.8  V to  3.65 V, with an \non-board regulator generating the internal digital supply voltage . \nThe record signal path includes very flexible input configurations  \nthat can accept differential and single -ended analog microphone  \ninputs as well as a digital microphone input. A  microphone bias \npin provides  seamless interfacing to  electret microphones. I nput \nconfigurations can accept up to six single -ended analog signals \nor variations of stereo differential or stereo single -ended signals \nwith two additional auxiliary single -ended inputs. Each input \nsignal has its own programmable  gain amplifier (PGA) for volume  \nadjustment and can be routed directly to the playback path output \nmixers, bypassing the ADCs. An automatic level control (ALC) can also be implemented to keep the recording volume constant.  \n The ADCs and DACs are high quality , 24-bit Σ-Δ converters \nthat operate  at selectable  64× or 128×  oversampling rat ios. The \nbase sampling rate of the converters is set by the input clock rate and can be further scaled with the converter control register \nsettings. The converters can operate at samplin g frequencies \nfrom 8 kHz to 96 kHz. The ADCs and DACs also include very \nfine-step digital volume controls.  \nThe playback path allows input signals an d DAC outputs to be \nmixed into  various output configurations. Headphone drivers \nare available for a stereo h eadphone output , and the other output  \npins are capable of differentially driving an earpiece speaker . \nCapless headphone outputs are possible with the use of the \nmono output  as a virtual ground connection . The stereo line \noutputs can be used as either singl e-ended or differential \noutputs  and a s an optional mix -down mono output . \nThe ADAU1361 can generate its internal clocks from a wide \nrange of input clocks by using the on -board  fractional  PLL.  \nThe PLL accepts inputs from 8 MHz to 27 MHz.  \nThe ADAU1361 is pro vided in a small , 32-lead, 5 mm × 5 mm \nLFCSP with an exposed bottom pad.  \n \nADAU1361 Data Sheet \n \nRev. D | Page 24 of 80 STARTUP , INITIALIZATION , AND POWER  \nThis section de scribe s the procedure for properly starting up \nthe ADAU1361. The following sequence provides a high level \napproach to the proper i nitiation of the system.  \n1. Apply power to the ADAU1361.  \n2. Lock  the PLL to the input clock (if using the PLL) . \n3. Enable the c ore clock. \n4. Load the register settings . \nPOWER -UP SEQUENCE  \nThe ADAU1361 uses a power -on reset (POR) circuit to  \nreset the registers upon pow er-up. The POR monitors the \nDVDDOUT pin and generates a reset signal whenever power  \nis applied to the ch ip. During the reset, the ADAU1361 is set  \nto the default values documented in the register map (see the  \nControl Register s section) . Typically, with a 10 μF capacitor on \nAVDD, the POR takes approximately 14 ms.  \n07679-074AVDD\nPORPART READY\nPOR\nACTIVEPOR ACTIVEDVDDOUT 1.35V\n0.95V1.5V\nPOR\nFINISHED \nFigure 28. Power -On Reset Sequence  \nThe PLL lock time is dependent on the MCLK rate. Typical  \nlock time s are provided in Table 11. \nTable 11.

These i nclude the ADCs, \nthe DACs, and the PLL.  \nIn addition, the control registers can be used to configure some \nfunctions for power saving, normal, or enhanced performance \noperation.  See the  Control Register s section for more \ninformation.  \nThe digital filters of the ADCs and DACs can each be set to over -\nsampling ratios of 64× or 128× (default). Setting the oversampling ratios to 64× for the se filters lowers power consumption with a \nminimal impact on performance. See the Digital Filters  section \nfor specifications; see the Typical Performance Characteristics  \nsection for graphs of these filters.  \nDIGITAL POWER SUPPLY  \nThe digital power supply for the ADAU1361 is generated from \nan internal regulator. This regulator generates a 1.5  V supply \ninternally. The only external connection to this regulator is the DVDDOUT bypa ssing point. A 100  nF capacitor and a 10  μF \ncapacitor should be connected between this pin and DGND .  \nINPUT/OUTPUT POWER S UPPLY  \nThe power for the digital output pins is supplied from IOVDD, \nand this pin also sets the highest input voltage that should be \nseen on the digital input pins. IOVDD should be set between \n1.8 V and 3.3  V; no digital input signal should be at a voltage \nlevel higher than the one on IOVDD. The current draw of this pin is variable because it depends on the loads of the digital outputs. I OVDD should be decoupled to DGND with a 100  nF \ncapacitor  and a 10  μF capacitor . \nCLOCK GENERATION AND  MANAGEMENT  \nThe ADAU1361 uses a flexible clocking scheme that enables the \nuse of many different input clock rates. The PLL can be bypassed \nor used, resulting in two different approaches to clock manage -\nment. For mo re information about clocking schemes, PLL \nconfiguration, and sampling rates, see the Clocking and \nSampling Rates  section.  \nCase 1: PLL Is B ypassed \nIf the PLL is bypassed, the core clock is derived directly from the MCLK input. The rate of this clock must be set properly in \nRegister R0 (clock control register, Address 0x4000) using the \nINFREQ[1:0] bits. When the PLL is bypassed, supported external  \nclock rates are 256 × f\nS, 512 × f S, 768 × f S, and 1024 × f S, where f S \nis the base sampling rate. The core clock of the chip is off until the core clock enable bit (COREN) is asserted.  \n \n \nData Sheet ADAU1361 \n \nRev. D | Page 25 of 80 Case 2: PLL Is U sed \nThe core clock to the entire chip is off during the PLL lock \nacquisition period. The user can poll the lock bit to dete rmine \nwhen the PLL has locked. After lock is acquired, the ADAU1361  \ncan be started by asserting the core clock enable bit (COREN) in Register R0 (clock control register, Address 0x4000). This bit \nenables the core clock to all the internal blocks of the ADA U1361.  \nPLL Lock Acquisition  \nDuring the lock acquisition period, only Register R0 (Address \n0x4000) and Register R1 (Address 0x4002) are accessible through  \nthe control port. Because all other registers require a valid master  \nclock for reading and writing, d o not attempt to access any other  \nregister . Any read or write is prohibited until the core clock \nenable bit (COREN) and the lock bit are both asserted.  To program the PLL during initialization or reconfiguration of \nthe clock setting, the following procedur e must be followed:  \n1. Power down the PLL.  \n2. Reset the PLL control register.  \n3. Start the PLL.  \n4. Poll the lock bit.  \n5. Assert the core clock enable bit after the PLL lock  \nis acquired.  \nThe PLL control register (Register R1, Address 0x4002) is a  \n48-bit register where a ll bits must be written with a single \ncontinuous write to the control port.  \n \nADAU1361 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

The core clock can be derived directly from MCLK \nor it can be generated by the PLL. The CLKSRC bit (Bit 3 in \nRegister R0, Address 0x4000) determines the clock source. \nThe INFREQ[1:0] bits should be set according to the expected \ninput clock rate selected by CLKSRC; this value also determines \nthe core clock rate and the base sampling frequency, f S. \nFor example, if the input to CLKSRC = 49.152 MHz (from \nPLL), then \nINFREQ[1:0]  = 1024 × fS \nfS = 49.152 MHz/1024 = 48 kHz \nThe PLL output clock rate is always 1024 × f S, and the clock \ncontrol register automatically sets the INFREQ[1:0] bits to  1024 × f\nS when using the PLL. When using a direct clock, the \nINFREQ[1:0] frequency should be set according to the MCLK \npin clock rate and the desired base sampling frequency. \nTable 12.

Depending on the MCLK frequency, the PLL must be set for either integer or fractional mode. The PLL can accept input frequencies in the range of 8 MHz t o 27 MHz.  \nAll six bytes in the PLL control register must be written with a \nsingle continuous write to the control port . \n07679-021MCLK ÷ X × (R + N/M)TO PLL\nCLOCK DIVIDER\n \nFigure 30.

Fractional Mode  \nFractional mode is used when the MCLK is a fractional  \n(R + (N/M)) multiple of the PLL output.  \nFor example, if MCLK = 12 MHz and  fS = 48 kHz , then  \nPLL required output  = 1024 × 48 kHz = 49.152 MHz  \nR + (N /M) = 49.152 MHz/ 12 MHz = 4 + (12/125)  \nCommon fractional PLL parameter se ttings for 44.1 kHz and \n48 kHz sampling rates can be found in Table 16 and Table 17. \nThe PLL outputs a clock in  the range of 41 MHz to 54 MHz , \nwhich should be taken into account when calculating PLL \nvalues and MCLK frequencies.  \n \nTable 15.

Record Signal Path  \n \n \nINPUT SIGNAL PATHS  \nThe ADAU1361 can accept both line  level  and microphone \ninputs. The analog inputs can be configured in a single -ended \nor differential configuration. There is also an input for a digital \nmicrophone.  The analog inputs are biased at AVDD/2. Unused \ninput pins should be connected to CM.  \nEach of the six analog inputs has individual gain controls (boost or cut). The input  signals are mixed and routed to an ADC. The \nmixed input signals can also bypass the ADCs and be routed directly to the playback mixers. Left channel input s are mixed \nbefore the left ADC;  however , it is possible to route the mixed \nanalog signal around the ADC and output i t into a left or right \noutput c hannel. The same capabilities apply to  the right channel \nand the right ADC.  Signals are inverted through the PGAs and the mixers. The result of this inversion is that differential signals input through the PGA are output from the ADCs at the same polarity as they are input. Single -ended inputs that pass through the mixer but \nnot through the PGA are inverted. The ADCs are noninverting.  \nThe input impedance of the analog inputs varies with the gain \nof the PGA. This impedance ranges from 1.7 kΩ at the 35.25  dB \ngain setting to 80.4 kΩ at the −12 dB setting. This range is shown  \nin Figure 22. \n \n \n \nADAU1361 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

The \ndigital microphone and ADCs share decimation filters and, \ntherefore, both cannot be used simultaneously. The digital \nmicrophone input select bit, INSEL, can be set in Register R19 (ADC control register, Address 0x4019).

Digital Microphone Interface Block Diagram  \nMicrophone Bias  \nThe MICBIAS pin provides a voltage reference for electret analo g \nmicrophones. The MICBIAS voltage is set in Register R10 (record microphone bias control register, Address 0x4010). In this register, the MICBIAS output can be enabled or disabled. \nAdditional options include high performance operation and a \ngain boost. Th e gain boost provides two different voltage biases: \n0.65 × AVDD or 0.90 × AVDD. When enabled, the high perfor -\nmance bit increases supply current to the microphone bias \ncircuit to decrease rms input noise.  \nThe MICBIAS pin can also be used to cleanly supply voltage  \nto digital microphones or analog microphones with separate power supply pins.  ANALOG -TO-DIGITAL C ONVERTERS  \nThe ADAU1361 uses two 24 -bit Σ -Δ analog -to-digital con -\nverters (ADCs) with selectable oversampling rat ios of 64× or \n128× (selected by Bit 3 in Register R17, Address 0x4017).  \nADC Full- Scale Level  \nThe full -scale input to the ADCs (0 dBFS) depends on AVDD. \nAt AVDD = 3.3  V , the full -scale input level is 1.0 V  rms. This \nfull-scale analog input output s a digital signal at − 1.38 dBFS. \nThis gain offs et is built into the ADAU1361 to prevent clipping. \nThe full -scale input level scales linearly with the level of AVDD.  \nFor single -ended and pseudo -differential signals , the full -scale \nvalue corresponds to the signal level at the pins, 0 dBFS.  \nThe full diff erential full -scale input level is measured after the \ndifferential amplifier, which corresponds to −6 dBFS at each pin.  \nSignal levels above the full- scale value cause the ADC s to clip.  \nDigital ADC Volume Control  \nThe digital ADC volume can be attenuated using  Register R20 (left \ninput digital volume register, A ddress 0x401A) and Register R21  \n(right input digital volume register, Address 0x401B).  \nHigh -Pass Filter  \nBy default, a high- pass filter is used in the ADC path to remove \ndc offsets; this filter can be enabled or disabled in Register R19 \n(ADC control registe r, Address 0x4019). At f S = 48 kHz, the \ncorner frequency of this high- pass filter is 2 Hz.  \n \nADAU1361 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 32 of 80 AUTOMATIC LEVEL CONTROL (ALC) \nThe ADAU1361 contains a hardware automatic level control \n(ALC). The ALC is designed to continuously adjust the PGA gain to keep the recording volume constant as the input level \nvaries.  \nFor optimal noise performance, the ALC uses the analog PGA \nto adjust the gain instead of using a digital method. This ensures \nthat the ADC noise is not amplified at low signal levels. \nExtremely small gain step sizes are used to ensure high audio \nquality during gain changes. \nT o use the ALC function, the inputs must be applied either \ndifferentially or pseudo-differentially to input pins LINN and LINP , for the left channel, and RINN and RINP , for the right channel. The ALC function is not available for the auxiliary line input pins, LAUX and RAUX. \nA block diagram of the ALC block is shown in Figure 36. The \nALC logic receives the ADC output signals and analyzes these \ndigital signals to set the PGA gain. The ALC control registers are used to control the time constants and output levels, as \ndescribed in this section. \n07679-024RIGHT\nADCLEFT\nADC\nMUTESERIAL\nPORTS\nALC\nDIGITALANALOG\nINPUT\nLEFT\nI2C\nCONTROLANALOG\nINPUT\nRIGHTPGA\n–12dB TO +35.25dB\n0.75dB STEP SIZE\n \nFigure 36. ALC Architecture \nALC PARAMETERS \nThe ALC function is controlled with the ALC control registers \n(Address 0x4011 through Address 0x4014) using the following \nparameters: \n\uf0b7 ALCSEL[2:0]: The ALC select bits are used to enable the \nALC and set the mode to left only, right only, or stereo. In stereo mode, the greater of the left or right inputs is used  \nto calculate the gain, and the same gain is then applied to \nboth the left and right channels. \n\uf0b7 ALCTARG[3:0]: The ALC target is the desired input \nrecording level that the ALC attempts to achieve. \uf0b7 ALCATCK[3:0]: The ALC attack time sets how fast the \nALC starts attenuating after a sudden increase in input level above the ALC target. Although it may seem that  the attack time should be set as fast as possible to avoid \nclipping on transients, using a moderate value results in \nbetter overall sound quality. If the value is too fast, the  ALC overreacts to very short transients, causing audible gain-pumping effects, which sounds worse than using a moderate value that allows brief periods of clipping on transients. A typical setting for music recording is 384 ms. \nA typical setting for voice recording is 24 ms. \n\uf0b7 ALCHOLD[3:0]: These bits set the ALC hold time. When \nthe output signal falls below the target output level, the gain is not increased unless the output remains below the target level for the period of time set by the hold time bits. \nThe hold time is used to prevent the gain from modulating \non a steady low frequency sine wave signal, which would cause distortion. \n\uf0b7 ALCDEC[3:0]: The ALC decay time sets how fast the ALC \nincreases the PGA gain after a sudden decrease in input level \nbelow the ALC target. A very slow setting can be used if the \nmain function of the ALC is to set a music recording level. A faster setting can be used if the function of the ALC is to compress the dynamic range of a voice recording. Using a very fast decay time can cause audible artifacts such as noise \npumping or distortion. A typical setting for music recording \nis 24.58 sec. A typical setting for voice recording is 1.54 sec. \n\uf0b7 ALCMAX[2:0]: The maximum ALC gain bits are used to \nlimit the maximum gain that can be programmed into the ALC. This can be used to prevent excessive noise in the recording for small input signals. Note that setting this \nregister to a low value may prevent the ALC from reaching \nits target output level, but this behavior is often desirable to achieve the best overall sound. \nFigure 37 shows the dynamic behavior of the PGA gain for a \ntone-burst input. The target output is achieved for three differ-\nent input levels, with the effect of attack, hold, and decay shown \nin the figure. Note that for very small signals, the maximum PGA gain may prevent the ALC from achieving its target level; in the same way, for very large inputs, the minimum PGA gain may prevent the ALC from achieving its target level (assuming that \nthe target output level is set to a very low value). The effects of \nthe PGA gain limit are shown in the input/output graph of \nFigure 38. \nData Sheet ADAU1361\n \nRev.

Effect of Varying the Maximum Gain Parameter \nNOISE GATE FUNCTION \nWhen using the ALC, one potential problem is that for small \ninput signals, the PGA gain can become very large. A side effect \nof this is that the noise is amplified along with the signal of interest. To avoid this situation, the ADAU1361 noise gate can \nbe used. The noise gate cuts off the ADC output when its signal \nlevel is below a set threshold. The noise gate is controlled using the following parameters in the ALC Control 3 register \n(Address 0x4014): \n\uf0b7 NGTYP[1:0]: The noise gate type is set to one of four \nmodes by writing to the NGTYP[1:0] bits. \n\uf0b7 NGEN: The noise gate function is enabled by writing to the \nNGEN bit. \n\uf0b7 NGTHR[4:0]: The threshold for muting the output is set by \nwriting to the NGTHR[4:0] bits. \nOne common problem with noise gate functions is chatter, \nwhere a small signal that is close to the noise gate threshold \nvaries in amplitude, causing the noise gate function to open and \nclose rapidly. This causes an unpleasant sound. \nTo reduce this effect, the noise gate in the ADAU1361 uses a \ncombination of a timeout period and hysteresis. The timeout period is set to 250 ms, so the signal must consistently be below the threshold for 250 ms before the noise gate operates. \nHysteresis is used so that the threshold for coming out of the mute state is 6 dB higher than the threshold for going into the \nmute state. There are four operating modes for the noise gate. \nNoise Gate Mode 0 (see Figure 39) is selected by setting the \nNGTYP[1:0] bits to 00. In this mode, the current state of the \nPGA gain is held at its current state when the noise gate logic is \nactivated. This prevents a large increase in background noise during periods of silence. When using this mode, it is advisable to use a relatively slow decay time. This is because the noise gate takes at least 250 ms to activate, and if the PGA gain has already \nincreased to a large value during this time, the value at which \nthe gain is held is large. \nINPUT\nANALOG\nGAIN\nDIGITAL\nMUTEGAIN HELDTHRESHOLD\nOUTPUTINTERNAL\nNOISE GATE\nENABLE SIGNAL250ms\n07679-027 \nFigure 39. Noise Gate Mode 0 (PGA Gain Hold) \nNoise Gate Mode 1 (see Figure 40) is selected by setting the \nNGTYP[1:0] bits to 01. In this mode, the ADAU1361 does a simple digital mute of the ADC output.

In this mode, the ADAU1361 improves the sound of the noise gate operation by first fading the PGA gain over a period of about 100 ms to the minimum PGA gain \nvalue. The ADAU1361 does not do a hard mute after the fade is \ncomplete, so some small background noise still exists. \nTHRESHOLD\nINPUT\nANALOG\nGAIN\nDIGITAL\nMUTE\nOUTPUTINTERNAL\nNOISE GATE\nENABLE SIGNAL250ms\nMIN GAIN\n100ms\n07679-029 \nFigure 41.

In general, this mode is the best-sounding mode, \nbecause the audible effect of the digital hard mute is reduced by \nthe fact that the gain has already faded to a low level before the \nmute occurs. \nTHRESHOLD\nINPUT\nANALOG\nGAIN\nDIGITAL\nMUTE\nOUTPUTINTERNAL\nNOISE GATE\nENABLE SIGNALMIN GAIN250ms\n100ms\n07679-030 \nFigure 42.

Playback Signal Path  \nOUTPUT SIGNAL P ATHS  \nThe outputs of the ADAU1361 can be configured as  a variety of \ndifferential or single -ended outputs . All analog output  pins are \ncapa ble of driving headphone or earpiece speakers. There  are \nselectable output paths for stereo signals or a downmixed mono \noutput.  The line outputs can drive a load of at least 10  kΩ or can \nbe put into HP mode to drive headphones or earpiece speakers.  \nThe analog output pins are biased at AVDD/2.  \nWith a 0 dBFS digital input and AVDD = 1.8 V , the full -scale \noutput level is 500 mV  rms; w hen AVDD = 3.3 V , the full -scale \noutput level is 920 mV  rms.  \nSignals are inverted through the mixers and volume controls. The result of this inversion is that the polarity of the differential \noutputs and the headphone outputs is preserved. The single -\nended mono output is inverted. The DACs are noninverting.  Routing Flexibility  \nThe playback path contain s five mixers (Mixer 3 to Mixer 7) \nthat perform the following functions : \n• Mix signals from the record path and the DACs . \n• Mix or swap the left and right channe ls. \n• Mix a mono signal or generate a common -mode  output . \nMixer  3 and Mixer 4 are dedicated to mixing signals from the \nrecord path and the DACs. Each of these two mixers can accept \nsignals from the left and r ight DACs, the l eft and right input \nmixers, and th e dedicated channel auxiliary input. Signals \ncoming from the record path can be boosted or cut before the \nplayback mixer.  \nFor example, the MX4G2[3:0] bits set the gain from the output \nof Mixer 2 (right record channel) to the input of Mixer 4, hence \nthe naming convention.  \nSignals coming from the DACs have digital volume attenu - \nation controls set in Register R20 (left input digital volume \nregister, Address 0x401A) and Register R21 (right input digital \nvolume register, Address 0x401B).  \nADAU1361 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 36 of 80 HEADPHONE OUTPUT \nThe LHP and RHP pins can be driven by either a line output \ndriver or a headphone driver by setting the HPMODE bit in \nRegister R30 (playback headphone right volume control register, Address 0x4024). The headphone outputs can drive a load of at least 16 Ω.  \nSeparate volume controls for the left and right channels range \nfrom −57 dB to +6 dB. Slew can be applied to all the playback \nvolume controls using the ASLEW[1:0] bits in Register R34 \n(playback pop/click suppression register, Address 0x4028). \nCapless Headphone Configuration \nThe headphone outputs can be configured in a capless output \nconfiguration with the MONOOUT pin used as a dc virtual \nground reference. Figure 44 depicts a typical playback path in  \na capless headphone configuration. Table 19 lists the register settings for this configuration. As shown in this table, the MONOOUT pin outputs common mode (AVDD/2), which \nis used as the virtual headphone reference. \n07679-075LHP\nRHPMONOOUTMIXER 3\nMX3LMLHPVOL[5:0]\nMX3EN\nMIXER 4\nMX4RMRHPVOL[5:0]\nMX4ENMIXER 7\nMX7[1:0]MONOM\nMOMODEMX7ENLEFT\nDAC\nRIGHT\nDAC\n \nFigure 44.

This is \nbecause of an internal capacitor that must charge before these outputs can be used. Figure 45 and Figure 46 illustrate the \nheadphone power-up/power-down sequencing. \nFor capless headphones, configure the MONOOUT pin before \nunmuting the headphone outputs. \n4msUSER\nDEFINED\n07679-046HPMODE\n1 = HEADPHONE\nINTERNAL\nPRECHARGERHPM AND LHPM\n1 = UNMUTE\n \nFigure 45.

Headphone Output Power-Down Timing \nGround-Centered Headphone Configuration \nThe headphone outputs can also be configured as ground-\ncentered outputs by placing coupling capacitors on the LHP  \nand RHP pins. Ground-centered headphones should use the \nAGND pin as the ground reference. \nWhen the headphone outputs are configured in this manner, \nthe capacitors create a high-pass filter on the outputs. The corner frequency of this filter, at which point its attenuation  \nis 3 dB, is calculated by the following formula: \nf\n3dB = 1/(2π × R × C) \nwhere: \nC is the capacitor value. \nR is the impedance of the headphones. \nFor a typical headphone impedance of 16 Ω and a 47 μF \ncapacitor, the corner frequency is 211 Hz. \nData Sheet ADAU1361 \n \nRev. D | Page 37 of 80 Jack Detection  \nWhen the JACKDET/MICIN pin is set to the jack detect fu nc-\ntion, a flag on this pin can be used to mute the line outputs \nwhen headphones are plugged into the  jack. This pin can be \nconfigured in Register R2 (digital microphone/jack detection \ncontrol register, Address 0x4008). The JDFUNC[1:0] bits set  \nthe functi onality of the JACKDET/MICIN pin.  \nAdditional settings for jack detection include debounce time \n(JDDB[1:0]  bits) and detection polarity  (JDPOL bit). Because  \nthe jack detection and digital microphone share a pin, both \nfunctions cannot be used simultaneously.   \nPOP- AND -CLICK SUPPRESSION  \nUpon power -up, precharge circuitry is enabled to suppress pops \nand clicks. After power -up, the precharge circuitry can be put \ninto a low power mode using the POPMODE bit in Register R34  \n(playback pop/click suppression register, Address 0x4028).  \nThe precharge time depends on the capacitor value on the CM pin and the RC time constant of the load. For a typical line output load, the precharge time is between 2 ms and 3 ms. After this \nprecharge time, the POPMODE bit can be set to low  power mode.  \nChanging any register settings that affect the signal path can \ncause pops and clicks on the analog outputs. To avoid these pops \nand clicks , mute the appropriate outputs using Register R29 to \nRegister R32 (Address 0x4023 to Address 0x4026). Unm ute the \nanalog outputs after the changes are made.  LINE OUTPUTS  \nThe line output pins (LOU TP , LOUTN, ROUTP , and ROUTN) \ncan be used to drive both differential and single -ended loads. In \ntheir default settings, these pins  can drive typical line loads of \n10 kΩ or greater, but they can also be put into headphone mode \nby setting the LOMODE bit in Register R31 (playback line ou tput \nleft volume control register, Address 0x4025) and the ROMODE \nbit in Register R32 (playback line output right volume control \nregister,  Address 0x4026). In headphone mode, the line output \npins are capable of driving headphone and earpiece speakers of 16 Ω or greater.  The output impedance of the line outputs is \napproximately 1 kΩ.  \nWhen the line output pins are used in single -ended mode, \nLOUTP and ROUTP should be used to output the signals, and \nLOUTN and ROUTN should be left unconnected.  \nThe volume controls for these outputs range from −57 dB to +6 dB. Slew can be applied to all the playback volume controls \nusing the ASLEW[1:0] bits in Regis ter R34 (playback pop/click \nsuppression  register , Address 0x4028).  \nThe MX5G4[1:0], MX5G3[1:0], MX6G3[1:0], and MX6G4[1:0] \nbits can all provide a 6  dB gain boost to the line outputs. This \ngain boost allows single -ended output signals to achieve  0 dBV \n(1.0 V rms) and differential output signals to achieve up to \n6 dBV (2.0  V rms). For more information, see Register R26 \n(playback L/R mixer left (Mixer 5) line output control register, Address 0x4020) and Register R27 (playback L/R mixer right \n(Mixer 6) line outp ut control register, Address 0x4021).  \n \n07679-076MIXER 3LEFT DACMX5G3[1:0]MIXER 5LOUTVOL[5:0]\nLOUTP\nMIXER 4RIGHT DACMX6G4[1:0]MIXER 6ROUTVOL[5:0]\nROUTPROUTNLOUTN\n–1–1\n \nFigure 47.

D | Page 38 of 80 CONTROL PORTS  \nThe ADAU1361 can operate in one of two control modes:  \n• I2C control  \n• SPI control  \nThe ADAU1361 has both a 4 -wire SPI control port and a  \n2-wire I2C bus control port. Both ports  can be used to set the \nregisters. The part defaults to I2C mode , but it can be put into \nSPI control mode by pulling the CLATCH  pin low three times.  \nThe control port is capable of full read/write operation for all \naddressable registers. The ADAU1361 must have a valid master \nclock in order to write to all registers except for Register R0 (Address 0x4000) and Register R1 (Address 0x4002).  \nAll addresses can be accessed in both a single -addr ess mode  \nor a burst mode. The first byte (Byte 0) of a control port write \ncontains the 7 -bit chip address plus the R/\nW bit. The next two \nbytes (Byte 1 and Byte 2) together form the subaddress of the \nregister location within the ADAU 1361. This subaddress must \nbe two bytes long because the memory locations within the \nADAU1361 are directly addressable and their sizes exceed the \nrange of single -byte addressing. All subsequent bytes (starting \nwith Byte 3) contain the data. The number of b ytes per word \ndepends on the type of data that is being written.  \nThe control port pins are multifunctional, depending on the mode in which the part is operating. Table 20 describes these \nmultiple functions.  \nTable 20.

This increment happens  \nautomatically after a single -word write or read unless a stop condi -\ntion is encountered (I\n2C) or CLATCH  is brought high (SPI). A \nburst write starts like a single- word write, but following the first \ndata -word, the data -word for the next immediate address can be \nwritten immediately without sending its two -byte address.  \nThe registers in the ADAU1361 are one byte wide with the \nexception of the PLL control register, which is six bytes wide. \nThe auto -increment  feature knows the word length at each \nsubaddress, so the subaddress does not need to be specified \nmanually for each address in a burst write.  \n \n The subaddresses are  auto -incremented by 1 following each  \nread or write  of a data -word , regardless of whether  there is a \nvalid register word at that address. Address holes in the register \nmap can be written to or read from without consequence. In  \nthe ADAU1361, these address holes exist at Address 0x4001, \nAddress 0x4003  to Address 0x4007, Address 0x402E , and \nAddr ess 0x 4032 to Address 0x4035. A single -byte write to these \nregisters is ignored by the ADAU1361, and a read return s a \nsingle byte 0x00.  \nI2C PORT \nThe ADAU1361 supports a 2 -wire serial (I2C-compatible) \nmicroprocessor bus driving multiple peripherals. Two pin s, \nserial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL), carry information \nbetween the ADAU1361 and the system I2C master controller. \nIn I2C mode, the ADAU1361 is alwa ys a slave on the bus, \nmeaning that i t cannot initiate a data transfer. Each slave device \nis recognized by a unique address. The address and R/ W byte \nformat is shown in  Table 21. The address resides in the first \nseven bits of the I2C write. Bits[5:6] of the I2C address for the \nADAU1361 are set by the levels on the ADDR1 and ADDR0 \npins. The LSB of t he address —the R/W bit—specifies either a \nread or write operation. Logic Level 1 corresponds to a read \noperation, and Logic Level 0 corresponds to a write operation.  \nTable 21.

The voltage on these signal lines \nshould not be higher  than IOVDD (1.8 V to 3.3 V).  \nAddressing  \nInitially, each device on the I2C bus is in an idle state and \nmonitors the SDA and SCL lines for a start condition and  \nthe prope r address. The I2C master initiates a data transfer by \nestablishing a start condition, defined by a high- to-low transition  \non SDA while SCL remains high. This indicates that an address/ \ndata stream follows. All devices on the bus respond to the start \ncondi tion and shift the next eight bits (the 7 -bit address plus the \nR/W bit) MSB first. The device that recognizes the transmitted \naddress responds by pulling the data line low during the ninth \nclock pulse. This ninth bit is known as an acknowledge bit. All \nother devices withdraw from the bus at this point and return to \nthe idle condition.  \n    \n \nData Sheet ADAU1361\n \nRev. D | Page 39 of 80 The R/ W bit determines the direction of the data. A Logic 0 on \nthe LSB of the first byte means that the master writes infor-\nmation to the peripheral, whereas a Logic 1 means that the master reads information from the peripheral after writing the subaddress and repeating the start address. A data transfer takes place until a stop condition is encountered. A stop condition \noccurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is \nheld high. Figure 48 shows the timing of an I\n2C write, and \nFigure 49 shows an I2C read. \nStop and start conditions can be detected at any stage during the \ndata transfer. If these conditions are asserted out of sequence with normal read and write operations, the ADAU1361 immediately jumps to the idle condition. During a given SCL high period, \nthe user should only issue one start condition, one stop condition, or a single stop condition followed by a single start condition. If \nan invalid subaddress is issued by the user, the ADAU1361 does \nnot issue an acknowledge and returns to the idle condition.  \nIf the user exceeds the highest subaddress while in autoincrement \nmode, one of two actions is taken. In read mode, the ADAU1361 outputs the highest subaddress register contents until the master \ndevice issues a no acknowledge, indicating the end of a read. A \nno acknowledge condition is where the SDA line is not pulled low on the ninth clock pulse on SCL. If the highest subaddress location is reached while in write mode, the data for the invalid byte is not loaded into any subaddress register, a no acknowledge \nis issued by the ADAU1361, and the part returns to the idle \ncondition. \n \nR/W 0SCL\nSDA\nSDA\n(CONTINUED)SCL\n(CONTINUED)111\nADDR0 ADDR10\nSTART BY\nMASTER\nFRAME 1\nCHIP ADDRESS BYTEFRAME 2\nSUBADDRESS BYTE 1\nFRAME 3\nSUBADDRESS BYTE 2FRAME 4\nDATA BYTE 1ACK BY\nADAU1361ACK BY\nADAU1361\nACK BY\nADAU1361ACK BY\nADAU1361\nSTOP BY\nMASTER\n07679-032 \nFigure 48.

D | Page 40 of 80 I2C Read and Write Operations  \nFigure 50 shows the format  of a single -word write operation. \nEvery ninth clock pulse, the ADAU1361 issues an acknowledge \nby pulling SDA low.  \nFigure 51 shows the format of a burst mode write sequence. Thi s \nfigure shows an example of a write to sequential single -byte \nregisters . The ADAU1361 increment s its subaddress register \nafter every  byte because the requested subaddress corresponds \nto a register or memory area with a 1 -byte word length.  \nFigure  52 shows the format of a single -word read operation . Note \nthat the first R/ W bit is 0, indicating a write operation. This is \nbecause the subaddress still needs to be written to set up the \ninternal ad dress. After the ADAU1361 acknowledges the receipt \nof the subaddress, the master must issue a repeated start command \nfollowed by the chip address byte with the R/ W bit set to 1 (read). This causes the ADAU1361 SDA to reverse and beg in driving \ndata back to the master. The master then responds every ninth \npulse with an acknowledge pulse to the ADAU1361. \nFigure 53 shows the format of a burst mode read sequence. This \nfigure shows an example of a  read from sequential single -byte \nregisters .

D | Page 41 of 80 SPI PORT  \nBy default, the ADAU1361 is in I2C mode, but  it can be put into \nSPI control mode by pulling CLATCH  low three times. This is \ndone by performing three dummy writes to the SPI port (the \nADAU1361  does not acknowledge these three writes). Beginning  \nwith the fourth SPI write, data can b e written to or read from \nthe IC. The ADAU1361 can be taken out of SPI mode only by  \na full reset initiated by power -cycling the IC.  \nThe SPI port uses a 4 -wire interface, consisting of the CLATCH , \nCCLK, CDATA, and COUT signals, and it is always a slave port. \nThe CLATCH  signal should go low at the beginning of a trans-\naction and high at the end of a transaction. The CCLK signal latches CDATA on a low -to-high transition. COUT data is shifted \nout of the ADAU1361 on the fal ling edge of CCLK and should \nbe clocked into a receiving device, such as a microcontroller, on the CCLK rising edge. The CDATA signal carries the serial input  \ndata, and the COUT signal carries the serial output data. The COUT signal remains three -state unt il a read operation is requested.  \nThis allows other SPI -compatible peripherals to share the same \nreadback line. All SPI transactions have the same basic format \nshown in \nTable 23. A timing diagram is shown in Figure 4. All \ndata should be written MSB first.  Chip Address R/ W \nThe LSB of the  first byte of an SPI transaction is a R/W bit. Th is bit \ndetermines whether the communicatio n is a read (Logic Level 1) \nor a write (Logic Level 0). This format is shown in Table 22. \nTable 22.

This subaddress is the location of the appropriate register. The MSBs of the subaddress are zero -padded to bring \nthe word to a f ull 2 -byte length.  \nData Bytes  \nThe number of data bytes varies according to the register being \naccessed. During a burst mode write, an initial subaddress is \nwritten followed by a continuo us sequence of data for consecu -\ntive register locations.  \nA sample timing diagram for a single -word  SPI write operation \nto a register is shown in Figure 54. A sample timing diagram of \na single -word  SPI read operation is shown in Figure 55. The \nCOUT pin goes from being three -state to being driven at the \nbeginning of Byte 3. In this example, Byte 0 to Byte 2 contain \nthe addresses and R/ W bit, and subsequent bytes carry the data.  \nTable 23.

D | Page 42 of 80 SERIAL DATA INPUT/OU TPUT PORTS  \nThe flexible serial data input and output ports of the ADAU1361 \ncan be set to accept or transmit data in 2 -chan nel format or in a \n4-channel TDM stream to interface to external ADCs or DACs. \nData is processed in twos complement, MSB  first format. The \nleft channel data field always precedes the right channel data \nfield in 2 -channel streams. In TDM mode, Slot 0 and Sl ot 1 are \nin the first hal f of the audio frame, and Slot 2  and Slot 3  are in \nthe second half of the frame. The serial modes and the position \nof the data in the frame are set in Register R15 to Register R18 \n(serial port and converter control registers, Address 0x4015 to \nAddress 0x4018).  \nIf the PLL of the ADAU1361 is not used, t he serial data clocks \nmust  be synchronous with the ADAU1361 master clock input. \nThe LRCLK and BCLK pins are used to clock both the serial \ninput and output ports. The ADAU1361 can be set as the  master \nor the slave in a system. Because  there  is only one set of serial \ndata clocks, the input and output ports must always be both \nmaster or both slave.  \nRegister R15 and Register R16 (serial port control registers, \nAddress 0x4015 and Address 0x4016) allow control of clock \npolarity and data input modes. The valid data formats are I2S, \nleft-justified, right -justified (24 -/20-/18-/16-bit), and TDM. In \nall modes except for the right- justified modes, the serial port \ninputs an arbitrary number of bits u p to a limit of 24. Extra bits \ndo not cause an error, but they are truncated internally.  \n The serial port can operate with an arbitrary number of BCLK \ntransitions in each LRCLK frame. The LRCLK in TDM mode can be input to the ADAU1361 either as a 50% duty  cycle clock \nor as a bit -wide pulse.  \nWhen the LRCLK is set as a pulse, a 47 pF capacitor should be connected between the LRCLK pin and ground (see Figure 56). \nThis capacitor is necessary in both master and slave m odes to \nproperly align the LRCLK signal to the serial data stream.  07679-07847pFLRCLKADAU1361\nBCLK\n \nFigure 56.

The connections to each side  of the capacitor should be as \nshort as possible, and the trace should stay on a single layer with \nno vias. For maximum effectiveness, locate the capacitor equi-\ndistant from the power and ground pins or, when equidistant placement is not possible, slightly closer to the power pin. Thermal connections to the ground planes should be made  \non the far side of the capacitor.  \nEach supply signal on the board should also be bypassed with a \nsingle bulk capacitor (10 μF to 47 μF). \nVDD GND\nTO GNDTO VDDCAPACITOR\n07679-048 \nFigure 62.

When designing a board for the ADAU1361, special consideration should be given to the following: \n\uf0b7 A copper layer equal in size to the exposed pad should be \non all layers of the board, from top to bottom, and should connect somewhere to a dedicated copper board layer (see Figure 64). \n\uf0b7 Vias should be placed to connect all layers of copper, \nallowing for efficient heat and energy conductivity.

Jack Detect P in Control Register  \n \nR67: Dejitter Control, 16,438 (0x4036)  \nThe dejitter control register allows the size of the dejitter window to be set, and also allows all dejitter circuits in the device to be activated or  \nbypassed. Dejitter circuits protect against duplicate samples or skipped samples due to jitter from the serial ports in slave mode. Disabling \nand reenabling certain subsystems in the device —that is, the ADCs, serial ports, and DACs— during operation can cause the associated \ndejitter circuits to fail. As a result, audio data fails to be output to th e next subsystem in the device.  \nWhen the serial ports are in master mode, the dejitter circuit can be bypassed by setting the dejitter window to 0. When the serial ports \nare in slave mode, the dejitter circuit can be reinitialized prior to outputting audio  from the device, guaranteeing that audio is output  \nto the next subsystem in the device. Any time that audio must pass through the ADCs, serial port, or DACs, the dejitter circu it can be \nbypassed and reset by setting the dejitter window size to 0. In this  way, the dejitter circuit can be immediately reactivated, without a wait \nperiod, by setting the dejitter window size to the default value of 3.  \nBit 7  Bit 6  Bit 5  Bit 4  Bit 3  Bit 2  Bit 1  Bit 0  \nDEJIT[7:0]  \nTable 70.
