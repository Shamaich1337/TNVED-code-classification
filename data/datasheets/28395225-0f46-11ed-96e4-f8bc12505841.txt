It can measure its own ambient temperature or thetemperature of two remote thermal diodes. These thermal diodes canbe located in a CPU or GPU, or they can be discrete diode connectedtransistors. The ambient temperature, or the temperature of the remote\nthermal diode, can be accurately measured to ±1°C. The temperature\nmeasurement range defaults to 0 °C to +127 °C, compatible with\nADM1032, but can be switched to a wider measurement range from−64°C to +191 °C.\nThe ADT7481 communicates over a 2-wire serial interface\ncompatible with System Management Bus (SMBus) standards. TheSMBus address of the ADT7481 is 0x4C. An ADT7481 −1 with an\nSMBus address of 0x4B is also available.\nAn ALERT\n output signals when the on-chip or remote temperature\nis outside the programmed limits. The THERM  output is a comparator\noutput that allows, for example, on/off control of a cooling fan. TheALERT\n output can be reconfigured as a second THERM  output if\nrequired.\nFeatures\n•1 Local and 2 Remote Temperature Sensors\n•0.25°C Resolution/1 °C Accuracy on Remote Channels\n•1°C Resolution/1 °C Accuracy on Local Channel\n•Extended, Switchable Temperature Measurement Range\n0°C to 127 °C (Default) or −64°C to +191 °C\n•2-wire SMBus Serial Interface with SMBus ALERT  Support\n•Programmable Over/Undertemperature Limits\n•Offset Registers for System Calibration\n•Up to 2 Overtemperature Fail-Safe THERM  Outputs\n•Small 10-lead MSOP Package\n•240/C0109A Operating Current, 5 /C0109A Standby Current\n•These Devices are Pb-Free, Halogen Free and are RoHS Compliant\nApplications\n•Desktop and Notebook Computers\n•Industrial Controllers\n•Smart Batteries\n•Automotive\n•Embedded Systems\n•Burn-In Applications\n•InstrumentationMARKING DIAGRAM\nwww. onsemi.com\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information in the package\ndimensions section on page 20 of this data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATIONMSOP−10\nCASE 846AC\nPIN ASSIGNMENT\nT0x\nAYW /C0071\n/C0071\n110\nT0x = Refer to Ordering Info Table\nA = Assembly Location\nY = YearW = Work Week\n/C0071 = Pb-Free Package\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)ALERT /THERM2SCLK\nSDATA\nD2+\nD2−VDD\nD1+\nD1−\nTHERM\nGND10\n9\n8\n7\n6 54321\nADT7481\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n2Figure 1.

When theADT7481 is operating normally, the on-board ADCoperates in a free-running mode. The analog inputmultiplexer alternately selects either the on-chip\ntemperature sensor to measure its local temperature, or\neither of the remote temperature sensors. The ADC digitizes\nthese signals and the results are stored in the local, Remote 1,\nand Remote 2 temperature value registers.\nThe local and remote measurement results are compared\nwith the corresponding high, low, and THERM\n temperature\nlimits, stored in on-chip registers. Out-of-limit comparisonsgenerate flags that are stored in the status register. A result that\nexceeds the high temperature limit, the low temperature limit,\nor remote diode open circuit will cause the ALERT\n output to\nassert low. Exceeding THERM  temperature limits causes the\nTHERM  output to assert low. The ALERT  output can be\nreprogrammed as a second THERM  output.\nThe limit registers can be programmed, and the device\ncontrolled and configured via the serial SMBus. Thecontents of any register can also be read back via the SMBus.\nControl and configuration functions consist of switching\nthe device between normal operation and standby mode,selecting the temperature measurement scale, masking orenabling the ALERT\n output, switching Pin 8 between\nALERT  and THERM2 , and selecting the conversion rate.\nTemperature Measurement Method\nA simple method of measuring temperature is to exploit\nthe negative temperature coefficient of a diode, measuringthe base-emitter voltage (V\nBE) of a transistor operated at\nconstant current.This technique requires calibration to null the effect of the\nabsolute value of V BE, which varies from device to device.\nThe technique used in the ADT7481 measures the change\nin V BE when the device is operated at two dif ferent currents.\nFigure 14 shows the input signal conditioning used to\nmeasure the output of a remote temperature sensor. Thisfigure shows the remote sensor as a substrate transistor, but\nit could equally be a discrete transistor. If a discretetransistor is used, the collector is not grounded and is linked\nto the base. To prevent ground noise interfering with themeasurement, the more negative terminal of the sensor is not\nreferenced to ground, but is biased above ground by an\ninternal diode at the D − input. C1 may optionally be added\nas a noise filter with a recommended maximum value of1,000 pF.\nTo measure /C0068V\nBE, the operating current through the\nsensor is switched among two related currents. The currents\nthrough the temperature diode are switched between I, and\nN×I, giving /C0068VBE. The temperature can then be calculated\nusing the /C0068VBE measurement.\nThe resulting /C0068VBE waveforms pass through a 65 kHz\nlow-pass filter to remove noise and then to achopper-stabilized amplifier. This amplifies and rectifies the\nwaveform to produce a dc voltage proportional to /C0068V\nBE.\nThe ADC digitizes this voltage producing a temperaturemeasurement. To red uce the effects of noise, digital filtering\nis performed by averaging the results of 16 measurement\ncycles for low conversion rates. At rates of 16, 32, and\n64 conversions/second, no digital averaging takes place.\nSignal conditioning and measurement of the local\ntemperature sensor is performed in the same manner.\nFigure 14.

C1 = 1000 pF MAX\nTemperature Measurement Results\nThe results of the local and remote temperature\nmeasurements are stored in the local and remote temperature\nvalue registers and are compared with limits programmedinto the local and remote high and low limit registers.The local temperature measurement is an 8-bit\nmeasurement with 1 °C resolution. The remote temperature\nmeasurements are 10-bit measurements, with the 8 MSBs\nstored in one register and the 2 LSBs stored in another\nregister. Table 6 is a list of the temperature measurementregisters.\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n8Table 6. REGISTER ADDRESS FOR THE\nTEMPERATURE VALUES\nTemperature\nChannelRegister\nAddress, MSBsRegister\nAddress, LSBs\nLocal 0x00 N/A\nRemote 1 0x01 0x10 (2 MSBs)\nRemote 2 0x30 0x33 (2 MSBs)\nIf Bit 3 of the Configuration 1 register is set to 1, then the\nRemote 2 temperature values can be read from the following\nregister addresses:\nRemote 2, MSBs = 0x01\nRemote 2, LSBs = 0x10\nThe above is true only when Bit 3 of the Configuration 1\nregister is set. To read the Remote 1 temperatures, this bitneeds to be switched back to 0.\nOnly the two MSBs in the remote temperature low byte\nare used. This gives the remote temperature measurement aresolution of 0.25 °C. Table 7 shows the data format for the\nremote temperature low byte.\nTable 7. EXTENDED TEMPERATURE RESOLUTION\n(REMOTE TEMPERATURE LOW BYTE)\nExtended Resolution Remote Temperature Low Byte\n0.00 °C 0 000 0000\n0.25 °C 0 100 0000\n0.50 °C 1 000 0000\n0.75 °C 1 100 0000\nWhen reading the full remote temperature value,\nincluding both the high and low byte, the two registersshould be read LSB first and then the MSB. This is because\nreading the LSB will cause the MSB to be locked until it is\nread. This is to guarantee that the two values read are derived\nfrom the same temperature measurement. The MSB register\nupdates only after it has been read. The MSB will not lockif a SMBus repeat start is used between reading the two\nregisters. There needs to be a stop between reading the LSB\nand MSB.\nIf the LSB register is read but not the MSB register, then\nfail-safe protection is provided by the THERM\n and ALERT\nsignals which update with the latest temperature measurementsrather than the register values.\nThe ADC updates the temperature registers at a rate\ndetermined by the Conversion Rate/Channel Selector\nRegister. The temperature registers are not updated if an I2C\nread is taking place. This is to prevent the register from being\ncorrupted during the read.\nWhen reading the full external temperature value, read the\nLSB first. This causes the MSB to be locked (that is, theADC does not write to it) until it is read. This feature ensuresthat the results read back from the two registers come fromthe same measurement.Temperature Measurement Range\nThe temperature measurement range for both local and\nremote measurements is, by default, 0 °C to +127 °C.\nHowever, the ADT7481 can be operated using an extended\ntemperature range. The temperature range in the extendedmode is −64°C to +191 °C. The user can switch between these\ntwo temperature ranges by setting or clearing Bit 2 in the\nConfiguration 1 register. A valid result is available in the nextmeasurement cycle after changing the temperature range.\nBit 2 Configuration Register 2 = 0 = 0 °C to +127 °C = default\nBit 2 Configuration Register 2 = 1 = −64°C to +191 °C\nIn extended temperature mode, the upper and lower\ntemperatures that can be measured by the ADT7481 arelimited by the remote diode selection. While the temperature\nregisters can have values from −64°C to +191 °C, most\ntemperature sensing diodes have a maximum temperature\nrange of −55°C to +150 °C.\nNote that while both local and remote temperature\nmeasurements can be made while the part is in extendedtemperature mode, the ADT7481 should not be exposed totemperatures greater than those specified in the Absolutesection. Furthermore, the device is only guaranteed to operateas specified at ambient temperatures from −40°C to +120 °C.\nTemperature Data Format\nThe ADT7481 has two temperature data formats. When\nthe temperature measurement range is from 0 °C to +127 °C\n(default), the temperature data format is binary for both local\nand remote temperature results. See the TemperatureMeasurement Range section for information on how toswitch between the two data formats.\nWhen the measurement range is in extended mode, an\noffset binary data format is used for both local and remoteresults. Temperature values in the offset binary data format\nare offset by +64. Examples of temperatures in both data\nformats are shown in Table 8.\nTable 8.

Binary scale temperature measurement returns 127 for all\ntemperatures >127 °C.\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n9The user may switch between measurement ranges at any\ntime. Switching the range will also switch the data format.The next temperature result following the switching will be\nreported back to the register in the new format. However, the\ncontents of the limit registers will not change. It is up to the\nuser to ensure that when the data format changes, the limitregisters are reprogrammed as necessary . More information\non this can be found in the Limit Registers section.\nRegisters\nThe registers in the ADT7481 are eight bits wide. These\nregisters are used to store the results of remote and localtemperature measurements, high  and low temperature limits,\nand to configure and control the device. A description of theseregisters follows.\nAddress Pointer Register\nThe address pointer register does not have, nor does it\nrequire, an address because the first byte of every writeoperation is automatically written to this register. The datain this first byte always contains the address of anotherregister on the ADT7481, which is stored in the address\npointer register. It is to this register address that the second\nbyte of a write operation is written to, or to which asubsequent read operation is performed.The power-on default value of the address pointer register\nis 0x00, so if a read operation is performed immediately afterpower-on, without first writing to the address pointer, the\nvalue of the local temperature will be returned since its\nregister address is 0x00.\nTemperature Value Registers\nThe ADT7481 has five registers to store the results of\nlocal and remote temperature measurements. These\nregisters can only be written to by the ADC and read by the\nuser over the SMBus.\n•The local temperature value register is at Address 0x00.\n•The Remote 1 temperature value high byte register is at\nAddress 0x01, with the Remote 1 low byte register at\nAddress 0x10.\n•The Remote 2 temperature value high byte register is at\nAddress 0x30, with the Remote 2 low byte register at\nAddress 0x33.\n•The Remote 2 temperature values can also be read from\nAddress 0x01 for the high byte, and Address 0x10 for the\nlow byte if Bit 3 of Configuration Register 1 is set to 1.\n•To read the Remote 1 temperature values, set Bit 3 of\nConfiguration Register 1 to 0.\n•The power-on default value for all five registers is 0x00.\nTable 9. CONFIGURATION 1 REGISTER (READ ADDRESS 0x03, WRITE ADDRESS 0x09)\nBit Mnemonic Function\n7 Mask Setting this bit to 1 masks all ALERT s on the ALERT  pin. Default = 0 = ALERT  enabled. This applies only if Pin 8 is\nconfigured as ALERT , otherwise it has no effect.\n6 Mon/STBY Setting this bit to 1 places the ADT7481 in standby m ode, that is, it suspends all temperature measurements\n(ADC). The SMBus remains acti ve and values can be written to, and read from, the registers. However THERM\nand ALERT  are not active in standby mode, and their states in standby mode are not reliable. \nDefault = 0 = temperature monitoring enabled.\n5 AL/TH This bit selects the function of Pin 8. Default = 0 = ALERT . Setting this bit to 1 configures Pin 8 as the THERM2  pin.\n4 Reserved Reserved for future use.\n3 Remote\n1/2Setting this bit to 1 enables the user to read the Remote 2 values from the Remote 1 registers. When default = 0,Remote 1 temperature values and limits are read from these registers.\n2 Temp\nRangeSetting this bit to 1 enables the extended temperature measurement range of −64°C to +191 °C. When using the\ndefault = 0, the temperature range is 0 °C to +127 °C.\n1 Mask R1 Setting this bit to 1 masks ALERT s due to the Remote 1 temperature exceeding a programmed limit. Default = 0.\n0 Mask R2 Setting this bit to 1 masks ALERT s due to the Remote 2 temperature exceeding a programmed limit. Default = 0.\nTable 10. CONFIGURATION 2 REGISTER (ADDRESS 0x24)\nBit Mnemonic Function\n7 Lock Bit Setting this bit to 1 locks all lockable registers to their current values. This prevents tampering with settings until\nthe device is powered down. Default = 0.\n<6:0> Res Reserved for future use.\nConversion Rate/Channel Selector Register\nThe conversion rate/channel selector register for reads is\nat Address 0x04, and at Address 0x0A for writes. The fourLSBs of this register are used to program the conversiontimes from 15.5 ms (Code 0x0A) to 16 seconds(Code 0x00). To program the ADT7481 to perform\ncontinuous measurements, set the conversion rate register to0x0B. For example, a conversion rate of eight\nconversions/second means that beginning at 125 msintervals, the device performs a conversion on the local and\nthe remote temperature channels.\nThis register can be written to, and read back from, the\nSMBus. The default value of this register is 0x08, giving a\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n10rate of 16 conversions per second. Using slower conversion\ntimes greatly reduces the device power consumption.\nBit 7 in this register can be used to disable averaging of the\ntemperature measurements. All temperature channels aremeasured by default. It is possible to configure the\nADT7481 to measure the temperature of one channel only.This can be configured using Bit 4 and Bit 5 (see T able 11).\nTable 11. CONVERSION RATE/CHANNEL SELECTOR REGISTER (READ ADDRESS 0x04, WRITE ADDRESS 0x0A)\nBit Mnemonic Function\n7 Averaging Setting this bit to 1 disables averaging of the temperature measurements at the slower conversion\nrates (averaging cannot take place at the three faster rates, so setting this bit has no effect). When\ndefault = 0, averaging is enabled.\n6 Reserved Reserved for future use. Do not write to this bit.\n<5:4> Channel Selector These bits are used to select the temperature measurement channels:\n00 = Round Robin = Default = All Channels Measured\n01 = Local Temperature Only Measured10 = Remote 1 Temperature Only Measured\n11 = Remote 2 Temperature Only Measured\n<3:0> Conversion Rates These bits set how often the ADT7481 measures each temperature channel.Conversion rates are as follows:\nConversions/sec Time (seconds)\n0000 = 0.0625 16\n0001 = 0.125 80010 = 0.25 4\n0011 = 0.5 2\n0100 = 1 1\n0101 = 2 500 m\n0110 = 4 250 m0111 = 8 = Default 125 m\n1000 = 16 62.5 m\n1001 = 32 31.25 m1010 = 64 15.5 m\n1011 = Continuous Measurements 73 m (Averaging Enabled)\nLimit Registers\nThe ADT7481 has three limits for each temperature\nchannel: high, low, and THERM  temperature limits for\nlocal, Remote 1, and Remote 2 temperature measurements.The remote temperature high and low limits span tworegisters each to contain an upper and lower byte for each\nlimit. There is also a THERM\n hysteresis register. All limit\nregisters can be written to, and read back from, the SMBus.\nSee Table 16 for details of the limit register addresses andpower-on default values.\nC will result in an out-of-limit condition, setting a flag in\nthe status register.\nIf the low limit register is programmed with 0 °C,\nmeasuring 0 °C or lower will result in an out-of-limit\ncondition.\nExceeding either the local or remote THERM\n limit asserts\nTHERM  low. When Pin 8 is configured as THERM2 ,\nexceeding either the local or remote high limit assertsTHERM2\n low. A default hysteresis value of 10 °C is\nprovided that applies to both THERM  channels. This\nhysteresis value may be reprogrammed.It is important to remember that the temperature limits\ndata format is the same as the temperature measurement data\nformat. So if the temperature measurement uses the default\nbinary scale, then the temperature limits also use the binary\nscale. If the temperature measurement scale is switched,however, the temperature limits do not automaticallyswitch.\nThe user must reprogram the limit registers to the desired\nvalue in the correct data format. For example, if the remotelow limit is set at 10 °C and the default binary scale is being\nused, the limit register value should be 0000 1010b. If the\nscale is switched to offset binary, the value in the low\ntemperature limit register should be reprogrammed to be0100 1010b.\nStatus Registers\nThe status registers are read-only registers, at\nAddress 0x02 (Status Register 1) and Address 0x23 (Status\nRegister 2). They contain status information for theADT7481.\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n11Table 12.

These flags stay high until the status register is read, or they are\nreset by POR.\nThe eight flags that can generate an ALERT  are NOR’d\ntogether. When any flag is high, the ALERT  interrupt latch\nis set and the ALERT  output goes low (provided that the\nflag(s) is/are not masked out).\nReading the Status 1 register will clear the five flags (Bit 6\nthrough Bit 2) in Status Register 1, provided the errorconditions that caused the flags to be set have gone away.Reading the Status 2 register will clear the three flags (Bit 4\nthrough Bit 2) in Status Register 2, provided the errorconditions that caused the flags to be set have gone away. A\nflag bit can only be reset if the corresponding value register\ncontains an in-limit measurement, or if the sensor is good.\nThe ALERT\n interrupt latch is not reset by reading the\nstatus register. It will be reset when the ALERT  output hasbeen serviced by the master reading the device address,\nprovided the error condition has gone away and the statusregister flag bits have been reset.\nWhen Flag 1 and/or Flag 0 of Status Register 1, or Flag 1\nof Status Register 2 are set, the THERM\n output goes low to\nindicate that the temperature measurements are outside theprogrammed limits. The THERM\n output does not need to be\nreset, unlike the ALERT  output. Once the measurements are\nwithin the limits, the corresponding status register bits arereset automatically, and the THERM\n output goes high. The\nuser may add hysteresis by programming Register 0x21.\nThe THERM  output will be reset only when the temperature\nfalls below the THERM  limit minus hysteresis.\nWhen Pin 8 is configured as THERM2 , only the high\ntemperature limits are relevant. If Flag 6 and Flag 4 of Status\nRegister 1, or Flag 4 of Status Register 2 are set, theTHERM2\n output goes low to indicate that the temperature\nmeasurements are outside the programmed limits. Flag 5and Flag 3 of Status Register 1, and Flag 3 of Status\nRegister 2 have no effect on THERM2\n. The behavior of\nTHERM2  is otherwise the same as THERM .\nBit 0 of Status Register 2 gets set whenever the ALERT\noutput is asserted low. Thus, the user need only read StatusRegister 2 to determine if the ADT7481 is responsible forthe ALERT\n. This bit gets reset when the ALERT  output gets\nreset. If the ALERT  output is masked, then this bit is not set.\nOffset Register\nOffset errors may be introduced into the remote\ntemperature measurement by clock noise or by the thermaldiode being located away from the hot spot. To achieve thespecified accuracy on this channel, these offsets must beremoved.\nThe offset values are stored as 10-bit, twos complement\nvalues.\n•The Remote 1 offset MSBs are stored in Register 0x11\nand the LSBs are stored in Register 0x12 (low byte, left\njustified).\n•The Remote 2 offset MSBs are stored in Register 0x34\nand the LSBs are stored in Register 0x35 (low byte, left\njustified). The Remote 2 offset can be written to, or\nread from, the Remote 1 offset registers if Bit 3 of the\nConfiguration 1 register is set to 1. This bit should beset to 0 (default) to read the Remote 1 offset values.\nOnly the upper two bits of the LSB registers are used. The\nMSB of the MSB of fset register is the sign bit. The minimum\noffset that can be programmed is −128°C, and the maximum\nis +127.75 °C. The value in the offset register is added to, or\nsubtracted from, the measured value of the remotetemperature.\nThe offset register powers up with a default value of 0 °C\nand will have no effect unless the user writes a differentvalue to it.\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n12Table 14.

Writing to theone-shot register address (0x0F) causes the ADT7481 to\nperform a conversion and comparison on both the local and\nthe remote temperature channels. This is not a data registeras such, and it is the write operation to Address 0x0F thatcauses the one-shot conversion. The data written to thisaddress is irrelevant and is not stored. However the ALERT\nand THERM  outputs are not operational in one-shot mode\nand should not be used.\nConsecutive ALERT  Register\nThe value written to this register determines how many\nout-of-limit measurements must occur before an ALERT  isgenerated. The default value is that one out-of-limit\nmeasurement generates an ALERT . The maximum value\nthat can be chosen is 4.\nThe purpose of this register is to allow the user to perform\nsome filtering of the output. This is particularly useful at thefastest three conversion rates, where no averaging takesplace. This register is at Address 0x22. This register hasother functions that are listed in Table 15.\nTable 15. CONSECUTIVE ALERT  REGISTER BIT\nBit Name Description\n7 SCL\nTimeoutSet to 1, enables the SMBus SCLtimeout bit.

Writing to Address 0F causes the ADT7481 to perform a single measurement. It is not a data register as such, and it does not matter what\ndata is written to it.\nSerial Bus Interface\nControl of the ADT7481 is achieved via the serial bus.\nThe ADT7481 is connected to this bus as a slave deviceunder the control of a master device.\nThe ADT7481 has an SMBus timeout feature. When this\nis enabled, the SMBus will typically timeout after 25 ms of\nno activity. However, this feature is not enabled by default.\nSet Bit 7 (SCL timeout bit) of the consecutive alert register(Address 0x22) to enable the SCL timeout. Set Bit 6 (SDAtimeout bit) of the consecutive alert register (Address 0x22)\nto enable the SDA timeout.\nThe ADT7481 supports packet error checking (PEC) and\nits use is optional. It is triggered by supplying the extra clockfor the PEC byte. The PEC byte is calculated using CRC −8.\nThe frame check sequence (FCS) conforms to CRC −8 by the\npolynomial:\nC(x)/C0043x8/C0041x2/C0041x1/C00411 (eq. 1)\nConsult the SMBus 1.1 specification for more\ninformation ( www.smbus.org ).Addressing the Device\nIn general, every SMBus device has a 7-bit device\naddress, except for some devices that have extended, 10-bit\naddresses. When the master device sends a device addressover the bus, the slave device with that address responds.The ADT7481 is available with one device address, 0x4C\n(1001 100b). An ADT7481 −1 is also available. The only\ndifference between the ADT7481 and the ADT7481 −1 is the\nSMBus address. The ADT7481 −1 has a fixed SMBus\naddress of 0x4B (1001 011b). The addresses mentioned inthis datasheet are 7-bit addresses. The R/W\n bit needs to be\nadded to arrive at an 8-bit address. Other than the differentSMBus addresses, the ADT7481 and the ADT7481 −1 are\nfunctionally identical.\nThe serial bus protocol operates as follows:\nThe master initiates data transfer by establishing a start\ncondition, defined as a high-to-low transition on the serialdata line (SDATA) while the serial clock line (SCLK)remains high. This indicates that an address/data stream\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n14follows. All slave peripherals connected to the serial bus\nrespond to the start condition and shift in the next eight bits,\nconsisting of a 7-bit address (MSB first) plus a R/W  bit,\nwhich determines the direction of the data transfer, that is,\nwhether data will be written to, or read from, the slavedevice. The peripheral with the address corresponding to the\ntransmitted address responds by pulling the data line lowduring the low period before the ninth clock pulse, known as\nthe acknowledge bit. All other devices on the bus remain idle\nwhile the selected device waits for data to be read from orwritten to it. If the R/W\n bit is 0, the master writes to the slave\ndevice. If the R/W  bit is 1, the master reads from the slave\ndevice.\nData is sent over the serial bus in a sequence of nine clock\npulses, eight bits of data followed by an acknowledge bitfrom the slave device. Transitions on the data line mustoccur during the low period of the clock signal and remainstable during the high period, since a low-to-high transition\nwhen the clock is high may be interpreted as a stop signal.\nThe number of data bytes that can be transmitted over the\nserial bus in a single read or write operation is limited onlyby what the master and slave devices can handle.\nWhen all data bytes have been read or written, stop\nconditions are established. In write mode, the master willpull the data line high during the tenth clock pulse to asserta stop condition. In read mode, the master device willoverride the acknowledge bit by pulling the data line high\nduring the low period before the ninth clock pulse. This isknown as no acknowledge. The master will then take the\ndata line low during the low period before the tenth clock\npulse, then high during the tenth clock pulse to assert a stop\ncondition.\nAny number of bytes of data may be transferred over the\nserial bus in one operation, but it is not possible to mix read\nand write in one operation because the type of operation isdetermined at the beginning and cannot subsequently bechanged without starting a new operation. In the case of the\nADT7481, write operations contain either one or two bytes,\nwhile read operations contain one byte.\nTo write data to one of the device data registers or to read\ndata from it, the address pointer register must be set so thatthe correct data register is addressed. The first byte of a write\noperation always contains a valid address that is stored in theaddress pointer register. If data is to be written to the device,\nthe write operation contains a second data byte that is written\nto the register selected by the address pointer register.\nThis procedure is illustrated in Figure 15. The device\naddress is sent over the bus followed by R/W\n set to 0 and\nfollowed by two data bytes. The first data byte is the address\nof the internal data register to be written to, which is storedin the address pointer register. The second data byte is thedata to be written to the internal data register.\nFigure 15.

BY\nADT74819\nR/W\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n16When reading data from a register there are two possible\nscenarios:\n1. If the address pointer register value of the\nADT7481 is unknown or not the desired value, it\nis necessary to set it to the correct value beforedata can be read from the desired data register.This is done by performing a write to theADT7481 as before, but only the data bytecontaining the register read address is sent, as datais not to be written to the register. This is shown inFigure 16.\nA read operation is then performed consisting of\nthe serial bus address, R/W\n bit set to 1, followed\nby the data byte read from the data register (shownin Figure 17).\n2. If the address pointer register is already at the\ndesired address, data can be read from thecorresponding data register without first writing tothe address pointer register, and the bus transaction\nshown in Figure 16 can be omitted.\nNOTES:Remember that some of the ADT7481 registers have\ndifferent addresses for read and write operations. The write\naddress of a register must be written to the address pointer\nif data is to be written to that register, but it may not be\npossible to read data from that address. The read address\nof a register must be written to the address pointer beforedata can be read from that register.\nALERT  Output\nPin 8 can be configured as an ALERT  output. The ALERT\noutput goes low whenever an out-of-limit measurement is\ndetected, or if the remote temperature sensor is open circuit.\nIt is an open-drain output and requires a pullup. SeveralALERT\n outputs can be wire-OR’ed together, so that the\ncommon line will go low if one or more of the ALERT\noutputs goes low.\nThe ALERT  output can be used as an interrupt signal to a\nprocessor, or it may be used as an SMBALERT . Slave\ndevices on the SMBus cannot normally signal to the busmaster that they want to talk, but the SMBALERT\n function\nallows them to do so.\nOne or more ALERT  outputs can be connected to a\ncommon SMBALERT  line connected to the master. When\nthe SMBALERT  line is pulled low by one of the devices, the\nfollowing procedure occurs as illustrated in Figure 18.\nFigure 18. Use of SMBALERTALERT RESPONSE\nADDRESS\nMASTER SENDS\nARA AND READ\nCOMMANDDEVICE SENDS\nITS ADDRESSRD START ACKDEVICE\nADDRESSNO\nACKSTOPMASTER RECEIVES SMBALERT\n1. SMBALERT  is pulled low.\n2. Master initiates a read operation and sends the\nalert response address (ARA = 0001 100). This isa general call address that must not be used as a\nspecific device address.\n3. The device with a low ALERT  output responds to\nthe alert response address, and the master reads the\naddress from the responding device. An LSB of 1is added because the device address is comprisedof seven bits. The address of the device is nowknown and it can be interrogated in the usual way.\n4. If more than one device has a low ALERT\n output,\nthe one with the lowest device address will havepriority, in accordance with normal SMBus\narbitration.\n5. Once the ADT7481 has responded to the alert\nresponse address, it will reset its ALERT\n output,\nprovided that the error condition that caused theALERT\n no longer exists. If the SMBALERT  line\nremains low, the master sends the ARA again, andso on until all devices with low ALERT\n outputs\nrespond.\nMasking the ALERT  Output\nThe ALERT  output can be masked for local, Remote 1,\nRemote 2 or all three channels. This is done by setting theappropriate mask bits in either the Configuration 1 register(read address = 0x03, write address = 0x09) or in the\nconsecutive ALERT\n register (address = 0x22)\nTo mask ALERT s due to local temperature, set Bit 5 of the\nconsecutive ALERT  register to 1. Default = 0.\nTo mask ALERT s due to Remote 1 temperature, set Bit 1 of\nthe Configuration 1 register to 1. Default = 0.\nTo mask ALERT s due to Remote 2 temperature, set Bit 0 of\nthe Configuration 1 register to 1. Default = 0.\nTo mask ALERT s due to any channel, set Bit 7 of the\nConfiguration 1 register to 1. Default = 0.\nLow Power Standby Mode\nThe ADT7481 can be put into low power standby mode\nby setting Bit 6 (Mon/STBY bit) of the Configuration 1\nregister (Read Address 0x03, Write Address 0x09) to 1.The ADT7481 operates normally when Bit 6 is 0. WhenBit 6 is 1, the ADC is inhibited, and any conversion inprogress is terminated without writing the result to thecorresponding value register.\nThe SMBus is still enabled in low power standby mode.\nPower consumption in this standby mode is reduced to a\ntypical of 5 /C0109A if there is no SMBus activity, or up to 30 /C0109A\nif there are clock and data signals on the bus.\nWhen the device is in standby mode, it is still possible to\ninitiate a one-shot conversion of both channels by writing to\nthe one-shot register (Address 0x0F), after which the devicewill return to standby. It does not matter what is written tothe one-shot register, all data written to it is ignored. It is also\npossible to write new values to the limit register while in\nstandby mode. ALERT\n and THERM  are not available in\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n17standby mode and, therefore, should not be used because the\nstate of these pins is unreliable.\nSensor Fault Detection\nThe ADT7481 has internal sensor fault detection circuitry\nat its D+ input. This circuit can detect situations where aremote diode is not connected, or is incorrectly connected,to the ADT7481. If the voltage at D+ exceeds V\nDD−1.0 V\n(typical), it signifies an open circuit between D+ and D −, and\nconsequently, trips the simple voltage comparator. The\noutput of this comparator is checked when a conversion isinitiated. Bit 2 (D1 open flag) of the Status Register 1(Address 0x02) is set if a fault is detected on the Remote 1channel. Bit 2 (D2 open flag) of the Status Register 2(Address 0x23) is set if a fault is detected on the Remote 2channel. If the ALERT\n pin is enabled, setting this flag will\ncause ALERT  to assert low.\nIf a remote sensor is not used with the ADT7481, then the\nD+ and D − inputs of the ADT7481 need to be tied together\nto prevent the open flag from being continuously set.\nMost temperature sensing diodes have an operating\ntemperature range of −55°C to +150 °C. Above 150 °C, they\nlose their semiconductor characteristics and approximateconductors instead. This results in a diode short, setting the\nopen flag. The remote diode in this case no longer gives an\naccurate temperature measurement. A read of the\ntemperature result register will give the last goodtemperature measurement. The user should be aware thatwhile the diode fault is triggered, the temperaturemeasurement on the remote channels is likely to beinaccurate.\nInterrupt System\nThe ADT7481 has two interrupt outputs, ALERT  and\nTHERM . Both outputs have different functions and\nbehavior. ALERT  is maskable and responds to violations of\nsoftware-programmed temperature limits or an open-circuit\nfault on the remote diode. THERM  is intended as a fail-safe\ninterrupt output that cannot be masked.\nIf the Remote 1, Remote 2, or local temperature exceeds\nthe programmed high temperature limits, or equals orexceeds the low temperature limits, the ALERT\n output is\nasserted low. An open-circuit fault on the remote diode also\ncauses ALERT  to assert. ALERT  is reset when serviced by\na master reading its device address, provided the errorcondition has gone away, and the status register has been\nreset.\nThe THERM\n output asserts low if the Remote 1,\nRemote 2, or local temperature exceeds the programmedTHERM\n limits. The THERM  temperature limits should\nnormally be equal to or greater than the high temperaturelimits. THERM\n is automatically reset when the temperature\nfalls back within the (THERM −hysteresis) limit. The local\nand remote THERM  limits are set by default to 85 °C. A\nhysteresis value can be programmed, in which case THERM\nwill reset when the temperature falls to the limit value minus\nthe hysteresis value. This applies to both local and remotemeasurement channels. The power-on hysteresis default\nvalue is 10 °C, but this may be reprogrammed to any value\nafter powerup.\nThe hysteresis loop on the THERM  outputs is useful when\nTHERM  is used for on/off control of a fan. The user’s\nsystem can be set up so that when THERM  asserts, a fan can\nbe switched on to cool the system. When THERM  goes high\nagain, the fan can be switched off. Programming a hysteresis\nvalue protects from fan jitter, a condition wherein thetemperature hovers around the THERM\n limit, and the fan is\nconstantly being switched on and off.\nTable 17.

A user may wish to use the ALERT  output as a\nSMBALERT  to signal to the host via the SMBus that the\ntemperature has risen. The user could use the THERM\noutput to turn on a fan to cool the system, if the temperature\ncontinues to increase. This method would ensure that there\nis a fail-safe mechanism to cool the system, without the need\nfor host intervention.\nFigure 19.

It\nis reset in the same manner as THERM , and it is not\nmaskable. The programmed hysteresis value also applies to\nTHERM2 .\nFigure 20 shows how THERM  and THERM2  might\noperate together to implement two methods of cooling thesystem. In this example, the THERM2\n limits are set lower\nthan the THERM  limits. The THERM2  output could be used\nto turn on a fan. If the temperature continues to rise and\nexceeds the THERM  limits, the THERM  output could\nprovide additional cooling by throttling the CPU.\nFigure 20.

However, large\ncapacitances affect the accuracy of the temperaturemeasurement, leading to a recommended maximumcapacitor value of 1,000 pF.\nFactors Affecting Diode Accuracy\nRemote Sensing Diode\nThe ADT7481 is designed to work with substrate\ntransistors built into processors or with discrete transistors.\nSubstrate transistors will generally be PNP types with thecollector connected to the substrate. Discrete types can be\neither a PNP or an NPN transistor connected as a diode (base\nshorted to collector). If an NPN transistor is used, the\ncollector and base are connected to D+ and the emitter to D −.\nIf a PNP transistor is used, the collector and base areconnected to D − and the emitter to D+.\nTo reduce the error due to variations in both substrate and\ndiscrete transistors, a number of factors should be taken into\nconsideration:\n•The ideality factor, nf, of the transistor is a measure of\nthe deviation of the thermal diode from ideal behavior.\nThe ADT7481 is trimmed for an nf value of 1.008. Use\nthe following equation to calculate the error introducedat a temperature, T ( °C), when using a transistor where\nn\nf does not equal 1.008. Consult the processor data\nsheet for the nf values.\n(eq. 2) /C0068T/C0043/C0466nf/C00421.008/C0467/C03241.008 /C0032/C0466273.15 Kelvin /C0041T/C0467\nTo factor this in, the user can write the /C0068T value to the\noffset register. It will then automatically be added to, or\nsubtracted from, the temperature measurement by the\nADT7481.\n•Some CPU manufacturers specify the high and low\ncurrent levels of the substrate transistors. The high\ncurrent level of the ADT7481, I HIGH , is 233 /C0258/C0109A. The\nlow level current, I LOW, is 14 /C0258/C0109A. If the ADT7481\ncurrent levels do not match the current levels specified\nby the CPU manufacturer, it may become necessary toremove an offset. The CPU data sheet will advise\nwhether this offset needs to be removed and how to\ncalculate it. This offset may be programmed to theoffset register. It is important to note that if more than\none offset must be considered, the algebraic sum of\nthese offsets must be programmed to the offset register.\nIf a discrete transistor is being used with the ADT7481,\nthe best accuracy is obtained by choosing devices accordingto the following criteria:\n•Base-emitter voltage greater than 0.25 V at 6 /C0109A, at the\nhighest operating temperature.\n•Base-emitter voltage less than 0.95 V at 100 /C0109A, at the\nlowest operating temperature.\n•Base resistance less than 100 /C0087.\n•Small variation in h FE (say 50 to 150) that indicates\ntight control of V BE characteristics.\nTransistors, such as 2N3904, 2N3906, or equivalents in\nSOT−23 packages, are suitable devices to use.\nThermal Inertia and Self-heating\nAccuracy depends on the temperature of the remote\nsensing diode and/or the local temperature sensor being at\nthe same temperature as that being measured. A number offactors can affect this. Ideally, the sensor should be in good\nthermal contact with the part of the system being measured;\notherwise, the thermal inertia caused by the sensor’s mass\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n19causes a lag in the response of the sensor to a temperature\nchange.\nIn the case of the remote sensor, this should not be a\nproblem, since it will either be a substrate transistor in the\nprocessor or a small package device, such as an SOT −23,\nplaced in close proximity to it.\nThe on-chip sensor, however, will often be remote from\nthe processor and only monitors the general ambienttemperature around the package. In practice, the ADT7481\npackage will be in electrical, and hence, thermal contact with\na PCB and may also be in a forced airflow. How accurately\nthe temperature of the board and/or the forced airflow\nreflects the temperature to be measured will also affect theaccuracy of the measurement. Self-heating, due to the power\ndissipated in the ADT7481 or the remote sensor, causes the\nchip temperature of the device (or remote sensor) to riseabove ambient. However, the current forced through theremote sensor is so small that self-heating is negligible. The\nworst-case condition occurs when the ADT7481 is\nconverting at 64 conversions per second while sinking the\nmaximum current of 1 mA at the ALERT\n and THERM\noutput. In this case, the total power dissipation in the device\nis about 4.5 mW. The thermal resistance, /C0113JA, of the\nMSOP−10 package is about 142 °C/W.\nLayout Considerations\nDigital boards can be electrically noisy environments, and\nthe ADT7481 measures very small voltages from the remote\nsensor, so care must be taken to minimize noise induced atthe sensor inputs. Take the following precautions:\n1. Place the ADT7481 as close as possible to the\nremote sensing diode. Provided that the worstnoise sources such as clock generators,\ndata/address buses, and CRTs are avoided, this\ndistance can range from 4 to 8 inches.\n2. Route the D+ and D − tracks close together, in\nparallel, with grounded guard tracks on each side.To minimize inductance and reduce noise pick up,a 5 mil track width and spacing is recommended.Provide a ground plane under the tracks ifpossible.\nFigure 21. Typical Arrangement of Signal Tracks5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL\nGNDD−D+GND3. Try to minimize the number of copper/solder\njoints that can cause thermocouple effects. Wherecopper/solder joints are used, make sure that they\nare in both the D+ and D − path and at the same\ntemperature.Thermocouple effects should not be a majorproblem as 1 °C corresponds to about 200 mV , and\nthermocouple voltages are about 3 mV/ °C of\ntemperature difference. Unless there are two thermocouples with a largetemperature differential between them,\nthermocouple voltages should be much less than\n200 mV .\n4. Place a 0.1 /C0109F bypass capacitor close to the V\nDD\npin. In extremely noisy environments, an input\nfilter capacitor may be placed across D+ and D −\nclose to the ADT7481. This capacitance can affectthe temperature measurement, so care must betaken to ensure that any capacitance seen at D+\nand D− is a maximum of 1,000 pF. This maximum\nvalue includes the filter capacitance, plus anycable or stray capacitance between the pins and thesensor diode.\n5. If the distance to the remote sensor is more than 8\ninches, the use of twisted pair cable isrecommended. A total of 6 feet to 12 feet of cableis needed.\nFor really long distances (up to 100 feet), use\nshielded twisted pair, such as Belden No. 8451microphone cable. Connect the twisted pair to D+and D− and the shield to GND close to the\nADT7481. Leave the remote end of the shieldunconnected to avoid ground loops.\nBecause the measurement technique uses switched\ncurrent sources, excessive cable or filter capacitance canaffect the measurement. When using long cables, the filtercapacitance can be reduced or removed.\nApplication Circuit\nFigure 22 shows a typical application circuit for the\nADT7481, using discrete sensor transistors. The pullups on\nSCLK, SDA TA, and ALERT  are required only if they are not\nalready provided elsewhere in the system.\nThe SCLK and SDATA pins of the ADT7481 can be\ninterfaced directly to the SMBus of an I/O controller, such\nas the Intel®820 chipset.\nADT7481\nwww. onsemi.com\n20Figure 22.
