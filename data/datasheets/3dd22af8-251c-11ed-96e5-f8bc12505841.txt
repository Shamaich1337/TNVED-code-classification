Package Type\nGeneral Description\nThe TC652/TC653 are integrated temperature sensors\nand brushless DC fan speed controllers with\nFanSense™ technology. The TC652/TC653 measure\ntheir junction temperature and control the speed of thefan based on that temperature, making them especially\nsuited for applications in modern electronic equipment.\nThe FanSense\n™ Fan Fault detect circuitry eliminates\nthe need for a more expensive 3-wire fan.\nTemperature data is converted from the on-chip\nthermal sensing element and translated into a\nfractional fan speed from 40% to 100%. A temperatureselection guide in the data sheet is used to choose the\nlow and high temperature limits to control the fan. The\nTC652/TC653 also include a single trip point overtemperature alert (T\nOVER ) that eliminates the need for\nadditional temperature sensors. In addition, the TC653\nincludes an auto fan shutdown function for additionalpower savings.\nThe TC652/TC653 are easy to use, require no software\noverhead and are therefore the ideal choice for\nimplementing thermal management in a variety ofsystems.Part Number Package Temperature Range\nTC652XXVUA 8-Pin MSOP    -40 \uf0b0C to +125 \uf0b0C\nTC653XXVUA 8-Pin MSOP       -40 \uf0b0C to +125 \uf0b0C\nX Temperature\nA2 5\nB3 0\nC3 5\nD4 0\nE4 5\nF5 0\nG5 51 8\n2 7\n3 6\n4 5FAULTVDDMSOP\nGNDPWM\nTOVER\nSENSE GNDTC652\nTC653SHDNIntegrated Temperature Sensor & Brushless DC Fan \nController with FanSense™ Detect & Over-Temperature\nTC652/TC653\nDS21452C-page 2 \uf0e3 2002-2012 Microchip Technology Inc.Typical Application Diagram\n1 8\n2 7\n3 6\n4 5FAULTVDD PWM\nGND\nTOVER\nSENSE\nRSENSEFanSense™\nGND\nGND+5V V DD+12V\nTC652\nTC653\nSHDN\n2Ω1k\n0.01µF\nCSENSE\nµControllerDC Fan\n300mA\nMax.\nSHDN Control Over-Temp\nAlert\n Fan Fault Alert\n\uf0e3 2002-2012 Microchip Technology Inc.

DS21452C-page 5TC652/TC653\n3.0 DETAILED DESCRIPTION\nThe TC652/TC653 acquire and convert their junction\ntemperature (TJ) information from an on-chip solid\nstate sensor with a typical accuracy of ±1°C. Thetemperature data is digitally stored in an internal\nregister. The register is compared with pre-defined\nthreshold values. The six threshold values are equallydistributed over a pre-defined range of temperatures\n(See Table 3-1 and Table 3-2). The TC652/TC653\ncontrol the speed of a DC brushless fan using afractional speed control scheme. The output stage\nrequires only a 2N2222-type small-signal BJT for fans\nup to 300mA. For larger current fans (up to 1 Amp) alogic-level N-channel MOSFET may be used. In\naddition to controlling the speed of the fan, the TC652/\nTC653 include an on-chip over-temperature alarm(T\nOVER ) that gives a low-true signal when the\ntemperature of the chip exceeds TH by 10°C. This\nfeature eliminates the need for a separate temperaturesensor for over-temperature monitoring. \nIn normal fan operation, a pulse-train is present at\nSENSE, Pin 5. A Missing Pulse Detector monitors this\npin during fan operation (FanSense\n™ technology). A\nstalled, open, or unconnected fan causes the TC652/\nTC653 to trigger its Start-up Timer once. If the FAULT\npersists, the FAULT  output goes low, and the device is\nlatched in its Shutdown mode. To release the fan from\nshutdown, toggle the SHDN  or VDD pin.\nTABLE 3-1: TEMPERATURE RANGE \nDEFINITION FOR TC652 (MINIMUM-SPEED MODE)TABLE 3-2: TEMPERATURE RANGE \nDEFINITION FOR TC653 (AUTO-SHUTDOWN MODE)\nFIGURE 3-1: F UNCTIONAL BLOCK \nDIAGRAM \n3.1 PWM  Output\nThe PWM pin is designed to drive a low cost transistor\nor MOSFET as the low side power switching element inthe system. This output has an asymmetric\ncomplementary drive and is optimized for driving NPN\ntransistors or N-channel MOSFETs. Since the systemrelies on PWM rather than linear power control, the\ndissipation in the power switch is kept to a minimum.\nGenerally, very small devices (TO-92 or SOTpackages) will suffice. The frequency of the PWM is\nabout 15Hz. The PWM is also the time base for the\nStart-up Timer (see paragraphs below). The PWM dutycycle has a range of 40% to 100% for the TC652 and\n50% to 100% for the TC653. Temperature\n (T = T\nJ)PWM Duty Cycle\nT < TL 40%\nTL< = T < T1 50%\nT1 < = T < T2 60%\nT2 < = T <T3 70%\nT3 < = T < T4 80%\nT4 < = T < T H 90%\nTH < = T < TOV 100% \nTOV < = T 100% with Over-Temp Alert\n(TOVER  = L)Temperature \n (T = TJ)PWM Duty Cycle\nT < TL “OFF”\nTL< = T < T1 50%\nT1 < = T < T 2 60%\nT2 < =T < T3 70%\nT3 < =T < T4 80%\nT4 < = T < T H 90%\nTH < = T < TOV 100% \nTOV  < = T 100% with Over-Temp Alert \n(TOVER  = L)\nNote:  The temperature regions defined by the six tempera-\nture thresholds are pre-defined in the TC650/651 by means\nof trimming. Once a TL and TH are programmed, the T1 - T4\nthresholds are automatica lly equally spaced between TL and\nTH.\nTemp Sensor\nFan Detect\nLogicDuty Cycle\nLogic\nControl\nAD  Converter\nOscillatorTemperature\nSet Point and \nTrim RangeSHDN TOVER\nPWM\nFAULT\n90mVVDDV+\nCMPTR+\n-20k\n--\nTC652/TC653\nDS21452C-page 6 \uf0e3 2002-2012 Microchip Technology Inc.3.2 Start-Up Timer \nTo ensure reliable fan start-up, the Start-up Timer turns\nPWM high for about 2 seconds whenever the fan isstarted from the off state. This occurs at power-up and\nwhen coming out of Shutdown mode. \n3.3 SENSE Input \n(FanSense™ Technology)\nThe SENSE input, Pin 5, is connected to a low value\ncurrent sensing resistor in the ground return leg of the\nfan circuit through the capacitor. During normal fanoperation, commutation occurs as each pole of the fan\nis energized. This causes brief interruptions in the fan\ncurrent, seen as pulses across the sense resistor. If thedevice is not in Shutdown mode, and pulses are not\nappearing at the SENSE input, a FAULT exists. The\nshort, rapid change in fan current (high di/dt) causes acorresponding dv/dt across the sense resistor, R\nSENSE .\nThe waveform on RSENSE  is differentiated and con-\nverted to a logic-level pulse-train by CSENSE  and the\ninternal signal processing circuitry. The presence and\nfrequency of this pulse-train is a direct indication of fan\noperation. \n3.4 FAULT  \nThis pin goes low to indicate a fan FAULT condition.Pulses appearing at SENSE pin due to the PWM turn-\ning on are blanked and the remaining pulses are\nfiltered by a Missing Pulse Detector. If consecutivepulses are not detected for 32 PWM cycles (about 2\nsec), the PWM is Low and FAULT\n goes low. FAULT  can\nbe disabled by momentarily toggling SHDN  or VDD pin,\nor cycling system power. FAULT  remains high during\nShutdown mode. \n3.5 Over-Temperature Alert (TOVER )\n This pin goes low when the TH set point is exceeded\nby 10°C (typical). This indicates that the fan is atmaximum drive, and the potential exists for system\noverheating: either heat dissipation in the system has\ngone beyond the cooling system\'s design limits, orsome FAULT exists such as fan bearing failure or an\nairflow obstruction. This output may be treated as a\n“System Overheat” warning and used to trigger systemshutdown, or bring other fans to full speed in the\nsystem. The fan will continue to run at 100% speed\nwhile T\nOVER  is asserted. Built-in hysteresis prevents\nTOVER  from “chattering” when measured temperature\nis at or near the TH + 10°C trip point. As temperature\nfalls through the TH + 10°C trip point, hysteresis\nmaintains the T OVER  output low until measured\ntemperature is 5°C above the trip point setting. 3.6 Shutdown (SHDN )\nThe fan can be unconditionally shutdown by pulling low\nthe SHDN  pin. During shutdown, FAULT  output is high\nand PWM output is low. This is ideal for notebook\ncomputers and other portable applications when you\nneed to change batteries and must not have the fanrunning at that time. Thermal monitoring and T\nOVER  are\nstill in operation during shutdown. IDD shutdown current\nis around 50 \uf06dA. \n3.7 Auto-Shutdown Mode\nThe TC653 has auto-shutdown. If the temperature is\nbelow the factory set point at minimum speed (T L),\nPWM is low and the fan is automatically shut off (Auto-\nshutdown mode). This feature is ideal for notebookcomputers  and other portable applications that need to\nconserve as much battery power as possible and thus\nrun a fan when it is only absolutely needed. The TC653will continue to be active so as to monitor temperature\nfor T\nOVER . The TC653 exits Auto-shutdown mode\nwhen the temperature rises above the factory set point(T\n1). \n3.8 Temperature Selection Guide \n(Minimum Fan Speed/Full Speed)\nThe five temperature regions defined by the six\nthresholds are defined in the TC652/TC653 by means\nof factory trimming. Once a TL and TH are set, the T1 –\nT4 thresholds are automatically equally spaced\nbetween T L and TH. \n\uf0e3 2002-2012 Microchip Technology Inc. DS21452C-page 7TC652/TC653\nTABLE 3-3: TEMPERATURE SELECTION \nGUIDE\nNote: The Bold Type temperature settings are available for ordering.\nContact factory for other temperature selections.\nTL and TH can be selected in 5°C increments. TH must\nbe chosen at least 10°C higher than TL. TL can range\nanywhere from 25°C to 35°C.\nAs an example, suppose you wanted the fan to run at\n40% speed at 25°C or less and go to full speed at\n45°C. You would order the part number TC652AEVUA. \nAs another example, suppose you wanted the fan to\nturn on at 30°C and go to full speed at 45°C. You\nwould order the part number TC653BEVUA.   4.0 TYPICAL APPLICATIONS\n4.1 Reducing Switching Noise\nFor fans consuming more than 300mA, a slowdowncapacitor (C\nSLOW ) is recommended for reducing\nswitching PWM induced noise (see Figure 4-1). The\nvalue of this capacitor should be 4.7 \uf06dF to 47 \uf06dF,\ndepending on the fan current consumption.\nSee Application Note AN771 “Suppressing Acoustic\nNoise in PWM Fan Speed Control Systems” for more\ninformation.\nFIGURE 4-1: REDUCING SWITCHING \nNOISETemp. \nRange °CTL          TH            Part #\n 10°C 25    35     AC\n30    40   BD\n35     45   CE\n 15°C 25     40 AD\n30 45  BE\n20°C 25   45   AE\n30    50 BF35 55 CG\n30°C 25 55 AG\n1 8\n2 7\n3 6\n4 5VDD PWM\nGND\nTOVER\nNC GND\nGND+5V V DD\nCSENSECSLOW\n0.01µF10µF\nRSENSE\n2Ω1kΩ+12V\nTC652\nTC653\nSHDNFAULT\nGND µControllerDC Fan\n400mA\nMax.\nSHDN Control\nFan Fault AlertOver-Temp\nAlert-\nTC652/TC653\nDS21452C-page 8 \uf0e3 2002-2012 Microchip Technology Inc.5.0 TYPICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nThe graphs and tables provided following this note are a statistical summary based on a limited number of samples \nand are provided for informational purposes only.
