The devices can distinguish data signals from noise due to differences in frequency, burst length, and en velope duty cycle. The data \nsignal should be close to the device’s band-pass center frequency (e.g. 38 kHz) and fulfill the conditions in the table below.When a data signal is app lied to the product in the \npresence of a disturbance, the sensitivity of the receiver is automatically reduced by the AGC to insure that no spurious \npulses are present at the receiver’s output.Some examples which are suppressed are:• DC light (e.g. from tungsten bulbs sunlight)• Continuous signals at any frequency\n• Strongly or weakly modulate d patterns from fluorescent \nlamps with electronic ballasts (see Fig. 14 or Fig. 15)\n  \nFig. 14 - IR Disturban ce from Fluorescent Lamp\nWith Low Modulation\nFig. 15 - IR Disturban ce from Fluorescent Lamp\nWith High Modulation\nNotes• For data formats with shor t bursts please see the datasheet for TSOP753.., TSOP755..\n• For Sony 12, 15, and 20 bit IR codes please see the datasheet of TSOP75S40F1692010100100010000\n01234567\n0 5 10 15 20Axis Title\n1st line\n2nd line2nd line\nIR Signal Amplitude\nTime (ms)\n1692110100100010000\n-60-40-2002040\n0 5 10 15 20Axis Title\n1st line\n2nd line2nd line\nIR Signal Amplitude\nTime (ms)\nTSOP752..

#### Description:
The TSOP75236TT is a miniaturized SMD infrared (IR) receiver module designed for infrared remote control systems. It integrates two PIN diodes and a preamplifier within a single package, which is encapsulated with an IR filter. The device demodulates the incoming IR signals, allowing the output signal to be directly connected to a microprocessor for decoding.

#### Typical Applications:
The TSOP75236TT is primarily used in remote control applications, such as:
- Consumer electronics (TVs, audio systems, etc.)
- Home automation systems
- Industrial remote controls
- Any application requiring IR communication, particularly those utilizing long burst codes.

This component is optimized for compatibility with legacy AGC2 designs, making it suitable for applications that require reliable performance in the presence of ambient light and noise interference.
