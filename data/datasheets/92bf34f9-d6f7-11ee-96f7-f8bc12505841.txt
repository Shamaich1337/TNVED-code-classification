The low 120 mV \ndropout  volta ge at  a 150 mA  load improves efficiency and allows \noperation  over a wide input voltage range.  \nThe ADP165/ ADP166  are specifically designed  for stable operation  \nwith a tiny 1 µF  ± 30% ceramic input and output capacitors  to \nmeet the  requirements of high performance, space  constrained \napplications.  \n The ADP165 /ADP166 are available in seven  fixed output \nvoltage op tions, ranging from 1.2 V to 3.3  V, and an adjustable \noutput option . The ADP165 also include s a switched resistor to \ndischarge the ou tput automatically when the LDO is disabled.  \nThe ADP16 6 is identical to the ADP165, but it does not include \nthe output discharge function.  \nShort -circuit and thermal overlo ad protection  circuits  prevent \ndamage in adverse conditions. The ADP165 /ADP166 are \navailable in a tiny 5 -lead TSOT , a 6-lead LFCSP , and a 4-ball, \n0.5 mm pitch WLCSP package for the smallest footprint \nsolution to meet a variety of portable power applications.  \n Rev.

This is a \nstress rating only; functional operation of the product at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational \nsection of this specifica tion is not implied. Operation beyond \nthe maximum operating conditions for extended periods may \naffect product reliability.  \nTHERMAL DATA  \nAbsolute maximum ratings only apply individually ; they do not \napply in combi nation. The ADP165/ ADP166 can be  damaged \nwhen the junction t emperature limits a re exceeded. Mo nitoring \nambient temperature does not guarantee that the  junction \ntemperature (T J) is within the specified temperature limits. In \napplications with high power dissipation and poor thermal \nresistance, the maximum ambient temperature  may have to be \nderated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low printed \ncircuit board ( PCB ) thermal resistance, the maximum ambient \ntemperature can exceed the maximum limit as long as the junction  \ntemperature is within specification limits. T J is dependent on \nthe ambient temperature (T A), the power dissipation of the \ndevice (P D), and the junction -to-ambient  thermal resistance of \nthe package (θ JA).  \nMaximum TJ is calculated from T A and P D using the formula  \nTJ = TA + (P D × θJA) Junction -to-ambient thermal resistan ce (θ JA) of the package is \nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4 -layer board. The \njunction -to-ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on the \napplication and board layout. In applications where high maximum  \npower dissipation exists, close atten tion to thermal board design \nis required. The value of θ JA may vary, depending on PCB material,  \nlayout, and environmental conditions. The specified values of \nθJA are based on a 4 -layer, 4 in ches × 3 in ches, circuit board. Refer  \nto JESD 51 -7 and JESD 51 -9 for detailed information on the \nboard construction.  \nΨJB is the junction to board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W . Ψ JB of the package is based on modeling and \ncalculation using a 4 -layer board. The JESD51 -12, Guidelines for \nReporting a nd Using Electronic Package Thermal Information , \nstates that thermal characterization parameters are not the same as thermal resistances. Ψ\nJB measures the component power flowing  \nthrough multiple thermal paths rather than a single path as in thermal resist ance (θ\nJB). Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths include \nconvection from the top of the package as well as radiation from \nthe package, factors that make ΨJB more useful in real -world \napplications. Maximum T J is calculated from the board \ntemperature (T B) and P D using the formula  \nTJ = TB + (P D × ΨJB) \nRefer to JESD51 -8 and JESD51 -12 for more detailed information  \nabout ΨJB. \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE  \nθJA and ΨJB are specified for worst -case conditions, that is, a \ndevice soldered in a circuit board for surface -mount packages.  \nTable 4.

Drawing only 590 nA (typical) \nat no load and a low 42 µA of quiescent current (ty pical) at full load  \nmakes the ADP165/ ADP166 ideal for battery -operated portable \nequipment. Shutdown current consumption is typically 5 0 nA. \nUsing  new innovative design techniques, the ADP165/ ADP166  \nprovide very low  quiescent current and superior transient \nperformance for digital  and RF applications .

Internal Block Diagram, Adjustable Output Without Output \nDischarge Function  \nInternally, the ADP165/ ADP166  consist of a reference, an error \namplifier,  a feedback voltage divider , and a PMOS pass transistor. \nOutput current is delivered via the PMOS pass devi ce, which is \ncontrolled  by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the \nreference voltage with the feedback vol tage from the output and \namplifies the difference. If the feedback voltage is lower than the \nreference  voltage, the gate of the PMOS devic e is pulled lower, \nallowing  more current to pass an d incre asing  the output voltage. \nIf the feedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the \ngate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing  less current to \npass and decreasing  the output voltag e. \nThe adjustable ADP165/ ADP166  have an output voltage range \nof 1.0 V to 4.2  V . The output voltage is set by the ratio of two \nexternal resistors , which are the  same as the R1 and R2 resistors in \nFigure 32 and Figure 34, but are connected through the ADJ pin . \nThe device servos  the output to maintain the voltage at the ADJ pin  \nat 1.0 V referenced to ground. The current in R1 is then equal \nto 1.0 V/R2 , and the current in R1 is the current in R2 plus the \nADJ pin bias curre nt. The ADJ pin bias current, 10  nA at 25°C, \nflows through R1 into the ADJ pin.  \nCalculate t he output voltage using the following equation:  \nVOUT = 1.0 V(1 + R1 /R2) + (ADJ I-BIAS)(R1 ) \nThe value of R1 must  be less than 200 kΩ to minimize errors in  the \noutput voltage caused by the ADJ pin bias current. For example,  \nwhen R1 and R2 each equal 200 kΩ, the output voltage  is 2.0 V . \nThe output voltage error introduced by the ADJ pin bias current is 2 mV or 0.05% , assuming a typical ADJ pin bias current of \n10 nA at 25°C.   \nRev. A | Page 13 of 23 \nADP165/ADP166  Data Sheet \n \nTo minimize quiescent current in the ADP165 /ADP166, Analog \nDevices, Inc., recommends using high values of resistance for \nR1 and R2. Using a value of 1 M Ω for R2 keeps the total, no \nload quiescent current below 2 µA. H owever,  note  that a high \nvalue  of resistance introduces a small output voltage error. For \nexample, assuming R1 and R2 are 1 M Ω, the output voltage is \n2 V . Taking into account the nominal ADJ pin bias current of \n10 nA, the output voltage error is 0.25% . \nNote that , in shutdown, the output is turned off , and the divider \ncurrent is zero.  The ADP165  also include s an output discharge res istor to force the  \noutput voltage to zero when the LDO is disabled. This ensures \nthat the output of the LDO is always in a well -defined state,  \nwhether it is enabled or not.  The ADP166 does not include the \noutput discharge function.  \nThe ADP165/ ADP166 are available in seven  output voltage  \noptions , ranging from 1.2  V to 3.3 V. The ADP165/ ADP166 use \nthe EN pin to enab le and disable the VOUT pin under normal \noperating conditions. When EN is high, VOUT turns on, and \nwhen EN is low, V OUT turns off. For a utomatic startup, tie EN \nto VIN. \n \nRev.

The ESR of the output capaci tor affects \nstabi lity of the LDO control loop . A minim um of 1 µF \ncapacitance  with an ESR of 1  Ω or less is recommended to \nensure stability of the ADP165 /ADP166. T ransient respon se to \nchanges in load current is also a ffected by output capacitance . \nUsing a larger value of output capacitance improve s the transient \nresponse of the  ADP165 /ADP166 to large  changes in load \ncurrent.

If an output \ncapacitance of greater than 1  µF is required, increase the input \ncapacitor  to match  it. Input and Output Capacitor Properties  \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the  \nADP165/ ADP166 , as long as they meet the minimum \ncapacitance and  maximum  ESR requirements. Ceramic \ncapacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, each \nwith different behavior over temperature and applied voltage. \nCapacitors  must have a dielectr ic adequate to ensure the minimum \ncapacitance over the necessary  temperature range  and dc bias \nconditions . X5R or X7R dielectrics  with a voltage rating of 6.3 V \nor 10 V are  recommended . Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are not \nrecommended due to their poor temperat ure and dc bias \ncharacteristics.  \nFigure 38 depicts the capacitance vs . voltage bias characteristic \nof a 0402, 1 µF, 10 V , X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a \ncapacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor  size and voltage \nrating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage  \nrating exhibit s better stability. The temperature variation of the X5R \ndielectric is about ± 15% over the − 40°C  to +85°C temperature \nrange and is not a function of package or voltage rating.  \n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0 2 4 6 8 10CAPACITANCE (µF)\nVOLTAGE\n12188-034 \nFigure 38.

The ADP165 /ADP166  are designed  to limit \ncurrent when the output  load reaches  320 mA (typical).  When \nthe output load exceeds 3 20 mA, the output voltage is reduced \nto maintain a constant current limit.  \nThermal overload protection is included , which  limit s the \njunction  temperature to a maximum of 150°C  (typical) . Under \nextreme conditions (that is, high ambie nt temperature and \npower dissipation) , when  the junction  temperature starts to rise \nabove 150°C, the output turn s off, reduc ing the output current \nto zero . When the junction temperature drops below 135°C, t he \noutput turn s on again , and the output current i s restored to its \nnominal value . \nRev. A | Page 16 of 23 \nData Sheet ADP165/ADP166  \n \nConsider the case where a hard  short from V OUT to ground \noccurs . At first , the ADP165/ ADP166 limit current so that only \n320 mA is conducted into the shor t.  \nIf self-heating of the junctio n temperature is great enough to \ncause its temperature to rise above 150°C, thermal shutdown  \nactiv ates, turning off the output and reducing the output current \nto zero. As the junction temperature cools and drops below 135° C, \nthe output turn s on and conduct s 320 mA into the short, again \ncausing the junction temperature to rise above 150°C . This  thermal  \noscillation  between 135°C and 150°C cause s a current oscillation \nbetween 320 mA and 0  mA that continue s as long as the short  \nremains at the output.  \nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect \nthe device against accidenta l overload conditions. For reliable  \noperation, device power dissipation must  be externally limited \nso that junction temperatures do  not exceed  125°C.  \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS  \nIn most applications, the ADP165 /ADP166 do not dissip ate \nmuch heat due to their  high efficiency. However, in applications  \nwith high ambient temperature  and high supply voltage to \noutput voltage differential, the heat dissipated in the package is high enough that it can cause the junction temperature of \nthe die to exceed the maximum junction temperature of 125°C.   \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter enters  \nthermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction temperature \nhas decreased below 135°C to prevent any permanent damage. \nTherefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is very \nimportant to guarantee reliable performance over all conditions. \nThe junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient \ntemperature of the environment and the temperature rise of the \npackage due to the power dissipation, as shown in Equation 2.  \nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction tempe rature of the \nADP165/ ADP166  must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the \njunction temperature stays below this maximum value, the user \nmust  be aware of the parameters that contribute to jun ction \ntemperature changes. These parameters include ambient temperature , power dissipation in the power device, and thermal \nresistances between  the junction and ambient air (θ\nJA). The θ JA \nnumber is dependent on the package assembly compounds that \nare used and the amount  of copper used to solder the package \nGND pins to the PCB.  \nTable 10 shows the typical θ JA values of the 5 -lead TSOT , 6-lead \nLFCSP , and the 4 -ball WLCSP for various PCB copper sizes. \nTable 11 shows the typical Ψ JB value of the 5 -lead TSOT , 6-lead \nLFCSP ,  and 4 -ball WLCSP .  \n \n \n \n Table 10.

Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies  to \nthe following:  \nTJ = TA + θJA[(VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD] (4) \nAs shown in Equation 4, for a given ambient temperature , input-\nto-output voltage differential , and continuous load current , there  \nexists a minimum copper size requirement  for the PCB to ensure \nthe junction temperature does not rise above 125°C. Figure 43 to \nFigure 57 show the junction temperature calculations for the \ndifferent ambient temperatures, load currents, V IN-to-VOUT \ndifferentials, and areas of PCB copper.  \nIn the case where the board temperature is known, use the thermal characterization parameter, Ψ\nJB, to estimate the junction  \ntemperature rise (see Figure 55 to Figure 57). Maximum junction  \ntemperature (T J) is calculated from the board temperature (T B) \nand power dissipation (P D) using the following formula:  \nTJ = TB + (P D × ΨJB) (5) \nThe typical value of Ψ JB is 17.9°C/W for the 6- lead LFCSP package, \n42.8°C/W for the 5- lead TSOT package , and 58.4°C/W for the \n4-ball WLCSP package.   \nRev.

Place the output capacitor as close as possible to \nthe VOUT pin and the GND pin.

Example of 6-Lead LFCSP PCB Layout \nData Sheet ADP165/ADP166  \nLIGHT S ENSITIVITY OF WLCSPs \nThe WLCSP pac kage option is essentially a silicon  die with \nadditional post fabrication dielectric and metal processing \ndesigned to contact solder bumps on the active side of the chip. With this package type, the die is exposed to ambient light and \nis subject to photoelectric effects. Light sensitivity an alysis of \na WLCSP mounted on standard PCB material reveals that \nperformance may be impacted when the package is illuminated  \ndirectly by high intensity light. No degradation in electrical \nperformance is observed due to illumination by low intensity (0.1 mW/ cm\n2) ambient light. Direct sunlight can have intensities of \n50 mW/cm2, and office ambient light can be as low as 0.1  mW/cm2. \nWhen the WLCSP is assembled on the board with the bump \nside of the die facing the PCB, reflected light from the PCB \nsurface is inci dent on active silicon circuit areas and results in \nthe increased leakage currents. No performance degradation occurs  \ndue to illumination of the backside (substrate) of the WLCSP .  \nAll WLCSPs are particularly sensitive to incident light with waveleng ths in the near infrared range (NIR, 700 nm to 1000  nm). \nPhotons in this waveband have a longer wavelength and lower \nenergy than photons in the visible (400 nm to 700 nm) and near ultraviolet (NUV , 200 nm to 400 nm) bands; therefore, they can \npenetrate more deepl y into the active silicon.  \nIncident light with wavelengths greater than 1100 nm has \nno photoelectric effect on silicon devices because silicon is \ntransparent to wavelengths in this range.  \nThe spectral content of conventional light sources varies considera bly. Sunlight has a broad spectral range, with peak \nintensity in the visible band that falls off in the NUV and NIR \nbands; fluorescent lamps have significant peaks in the visible \nbut not the NUV or NIR bands. Tungsten lighting has a broad peak in the longe r visible wavelengths with a significant tail in \nthe NIR.  \nEfforts have been made at a product level to reduce the effect of ambient light; the under bump metal (UBM) has been designed to shield the sensitive circuit areas on the active side (bump side)  of \nthe die. However, if an application encounters any light sensitivity  \nwith the WLCSP , shielding the bump side of the WLCSP package  \nwith opaque material eliminates this effect. Shielding can be \naccomplished using materials such as silica -filled liquid epoxie s \nlike those used in flip -chip underfill techniques.  \nRev.
