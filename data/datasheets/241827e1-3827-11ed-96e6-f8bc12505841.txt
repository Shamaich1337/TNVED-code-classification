CF is \nfor optimal noise management, with values that depend on \nthe application.ACS758xCB\nThe Allegro™ ACS758 family of current sensor ICs provides \neconomical and precise solutions for AC or DC current sensing. \nTypical applications include motor control, load detection and \nmanagement, power supply and DC-to-DC converter control, \ninverter control, and overcurrent fault detection.\nThe device consists of a precision, low-offset linear Hall \ncircuit with a copper conduction path located near the die. \nApplied current flowing through this copper conduction path \ngenerates a magnetic field which the Hall IC converts into a \nproportional voltage. Device accuracy is optimized through the \nclose proximity of the magnetic signal to the Hall transducer. \nA precise, proportional output voltage is provided by the \nlow-offset, chopper-stabilized BiCMOS Hall IC, which is \nprogrammed for accuracy at the factory.\nHigh-level immunity to current conductor dV/dt and stray \nelectric fields, offered by Allegro proprietary integrated shield \ntechnology, provides low output voltage ripple and low offset \ndrift in high-side, high-voltage applications.\nThe output of the device has a positive slope (>VCC / 2) when an \nincreasing current flows through the primary copper conduction \npath (from terminal 4 to terminal 5), which is the path used \nfor current sampling. The internal resistance of this conductive \npath is 100 µΩ typical, providing low power loss. \nThe thickness of the copper conductor allows survival of the \ndevice at high overcurrent conditions. The terminals of the \nconductive path are electrically isolated from the signal leads \nACS758-DS, Rev. 18\nMCO-0000203Thermally Enhanced, Fully Integrated, Hall-Effect-Based  \nLinear Current Sensor IC with 100 µΩ Current Conductor\nContinued on the next page…Continued on the next page…\nTypical Application  VOUTRFCFCBYP\n0.1 µFIP–\nIP+2GND5\n4ACS758\n31\nVIOUTVCC\nIP+3.3 or 5 V• Industry-leading noise performance through proprietary \namplifier and filter design techniques\n• Integrated shield greatly reduces capacitive coupling \nfrom current conductor to die due to high dV/dt signals, \nand prevents offset drift in high-side, high-voltage \napplications \n• Total output error improvement through gain and offset \ntrim over temperature\n• Small package size, with easy mounting capability\n• Monolithic Hall IC for high reliability\n• Ultralow power loss: 100 µΩ internal conductor \nresistance\n• Galvanic isolation allows use in economical, high-side \ncurrent sensing in high-voltage systems\n• AEC-Q100 qualified\nPACKAGE:  5-Pin CB Package\nPFF\nLeadform\nPSF\nLeadform\nPSS\nLeadformFEATURES AND BENEFITS DESCRIPTION\nMay 16, 2022\nTÜV America  \nCertificate Number:  \nU8V 15 05 54214 037\nUL Certified File \nNo.: US-29755-UL\nThermally Enhanced, Fully Integrated, Hall-Effect-Based  \nLinear Current Sensor IC with 100 µΩ Current ConductorACS758xCB2\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comSelection Guide\nPart Number [1]Package Primary Sampled \nCurrent, IP \n(A)Sensitivity  \nSens (Typ.)\n(mV/A)Current  \nDirectionalityTOP  \n(°C)Packing\nTerminals Signal Pins\nACS758LCB-050B-PFF-T Formed Formed ±50 40.

The change in device output in response to a \n1 A change through the primary conductor. The sensitivity is the \nproduct of the magnetic circuit sensitivity (G / A) and the linear \nIC amplifier gain (mV/G). The linear IC amplifier gain is pro -\ngrammed at the factory to optimize the sensitivity (mV/A) for the \nhalf-scale current of the device.\nNoise (VNOISE ). The noise floor is derived from the thermal and \nshot noise observed in Hall elements. Dividing the noise (mV) \nby the sensitivity (mV/A) provides the smallest current that the \ndevice is able to resolve.   \nNonlinearity (ELIN). The degree to which the voltage output \nfrom the IC varies in direct proportion to the primary current \nthrough its half-scale amplitude. Nonlinearity in the output can be \nattributed to the saturation of the flux concentrator approaching \nthe half-scale current. The following equation is used to derive \nthe linearity:\n100 1– [{ [{VIOUT_half-scale amperes  –  VIOUT(Q) ∆ gain × % sat ( )\n2 (V IOUT_quarter -scale amperes  –   VIOUT(Q) )  \nwhere\n∆ gain = the gain variation as a function of temperature changes \nfrom 25°C,  \n% sat = the percentage of saturation of the flux concentra -\ntor, which becomes significant as the current being sampled \napproaches half-scale ±IP , and  \nVIOUT_half-scale amperes  = the output voltage (V) when the sampled \ncurrent approximates half-scale ±IP .\nSymmetry (ESYM).  The degree to which the absolute voltage \noutput from the IC varies in proportion to either a positive or \nnegative half-scale primary current. The following equation is \nused to derive symmetry:\n100VIOUT_+ half-scale amperes  –     V IOUT(Q)\nVIOUT(Q)  –VIOUT_–half-scale amperes /uniF089/uniF090\nRatiometry.  The device features a ratiometric output. This \nmeans that the quiescent voltage output, VIOUTQ , and the mag -\nnetic sensitivity, Sens, are proportional to the supply voltage, VCC.The ratiometric change (%) in the quiescent voltage output is \ndefined as:\nVCC 5 VVIOUTQ(V CC)VIOUTQ(5V)\n∆VIOUTQ(∆V) = × 100%\nand the ratiometric change (%) in sensitivity is defined as:\nVCC 5 V= × 100% ∆Sens (∆V)Sens (VCC) Sens (5V)\nQuiescent output voltage (VIOUT(Q) ). Quiescent output voltage \n(VIOUT(Q) ). The output of the device when the primary current is \nzero. For bidirectional devices, it nominally remains at VCC  ⁄ 2. \nThus, VCC = 5 V translates into VIOUT(QBI)  = 2.5 V . For unidirec -\ntional devices, it nominally remains at 0.12 × VCC . Thus, VCC \n= 5 V translates into VIOUT(QUNI)  = 0.6 V . Variation in VIOUT(Q)  \ncan be attributed to the resolution of the Allegro linear IC quies -\ncent voltage trim, magnetic hysteresis, and thermal drift.\nElectrical offset voltage (VOE). The deviation of the device out -\nput from its ideal quiescent value of VCC ⁄ 2 for bidirectional and \n0.1 × VCC for unidirectional devices, due to nonmagnetic causes. \nMagnetic offset error (IERROM ). The magnetic offset is due to \nthe residual magnetism (remnant field) of the core material. The \nmagnetic offset error is highest when the magnetic circuit has \nbeen saturated, usually when the device has been subjected to a \nfull-scale or high-current overload condition. The magnetic offset \nis largely dependent on the material used as a flux concentrator. \nThe larger magnetic offsets are observed at the lower operating \ntemperatures.\nTotal Output Error (ETOT). The maximum deviation of the \nactual output from its ideal value, also referred to as accuracy , \nillustrated graphically in the output voltage versus current chart \non the following page.\nETOT is divided into four areas:\n• 0 A at 25°C.  Accuracy at the zero current flow at 25°C, \nwithout the effects of temperature.\n• 0 A over Δ temperature.  Accuracy at the zero current flow \nincluding temperature effects.\n• Half-scale current at 25°C.

When the supply is ramped to its operat -\ning voltage, the device requires a finite time to power its internal \ncomponents before responding to an input magnetic field.\nPower-On Time, tPO , is defined as the time it takes for the output \nvoltage to settle within ±10% of its steady state value under an \napplied magnetic field, after the power supply has reached its \nminimum specified operating voltage, VCC(min), as shown in the \nchart at right.\nRise time (tr).

The rise time to a step response is used to \nderive the bandwidth of the device, in which ƒ(–3 dB) = 0.35 / tr. \nBoth tr and tRESPONSE  are detrimentally affected by eddy current \nlosses observed in the conductive IC ground plane.\nPropagation delay (tPROP ). The time required for the device \noutput to reflect a change in the primary current signal. Propaga -\ntion delay is attributed to inductive loading within the linear IC \npackage, as well as in the inductive loop formed by the primary \nconductor geometry.

The technique nearly eliminates Hall IC \noutput drift induced by temperature or package stress effects. \nThis offset reduction technique is based on a signal modulation-\ndemodulation process. Modulation is used to separate the unde -\nsired DC offset signal from the magnetically induced signal in the \nfrequency domain.  Then, using a low-pass filter, the modulated \nDC offset is suppressed while the magnetically induced signal \npasses through the filter. The anti-aliasing filter prevents aliasing \nfrom happening in applications with high frequency signal com -ponents which are beyond the user’s frequency range of interest. \nAs a result of this chopper stabilization approach, the output \nvoltage from the Hall IC is desensitized to the effects of tempera -\nture and mechanical stress. This technique produces devices that \nhave an extremely stable Electrical Offset V oltage, are immune to \nthermal stress, and have precise recoverability after temperature \ncycling.  \nThis technique is made possible through the use of a BiCMOS \nprocess that allows the use of low-offset and low-noise amplifiers \nin combination with high-density logic integration and sample \nand hold circuits.

**Description:**
The ACS758LCB-050B-PFF-T is a thermally enhanced, fully integrated Hall-effect-based linear current sensor IC designed for precise AC or DC current sensing. It utilizes a low-offset linear Hall circuit and a copper conduction path to generate a magnetic field proportional to the current flowing through it. The Hall IC converts this magnetic field into a corresponding analog output voltage (VOUT), which varies linearly with the sampled current (IP). 

**Typical Applications:**
This current sensor is suitable for a variety of applications, including:
- Motor control
- Load detection and management
- Power supply and DC-to-DC converter control
- Inverter control
- Overcurrent fault detection

The device's high accuracy, low power loss (with a typical internal resistance of 100 µΩ), and ability to operate in high-voltage environments make it ideal for use in automotive and industrial applications where reliable current measurement is critical.
