!==============================================================================!
Based on the provided text, it appears to be a drawing or assembly document rather than a datasheet for a specific electronic component. The information does not include key specifications or characteristics typically found in a datasheet, such as voltage ratings, current ratings, power consumption, or operating temperature range.

However, I can summarize the information that is present:

### Component Summary for NEXTRONICS ENGINEERING CORP. Product Code 221282

#### Key Parameters:
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not specified in the provided text.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified in the provided text.
- **Power Consumption:** Not specified in the provided text.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** Not specified in the provided text.
- **Package Type:** Not specified in the provided text.
- **Special Features or Notes:** The document mentions a combination diagram and assembly details, but no specific features are listed.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (JEDEC J-STD-020E):** Not specified in the provided text.

#### Description:
The document appears to be an assembly drawing for a component or system related to the NEXTRONICS ENGINEERING CORP. product line. It includes part numbers and quantities for various components but does not provide a clear description of the component itself or its primary function.

#### Typical Applications:
