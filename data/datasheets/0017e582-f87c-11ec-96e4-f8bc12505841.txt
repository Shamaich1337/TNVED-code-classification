### Component Summary: TUF-3HSM

**Description:**
The TUF-3HSM is a surface mount frequency mixer produced by Mini-Circuits. It is designed for use in RF applications, specifically for converting signals from one frequency to another. The mixer operates over a wide frequency range and is characterized by low conversion loss and high isolation between ports.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; operates with LO power levels up to +20 dBm.
- **Current Ratings:** 
  - IF Current: 40 mA
- **Power Consumption:** 
  - RF Power: 200 mW
- **Operating Temperature Range:** 
  - -55°C to 100°C
- **Storage Temperature Range:** 
  - -55°C to 100°C
- **Package Type:** Surface mount (Case Style: NNN150)
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Level 1 (JEDEC J-STD-020E)
- **Special Features:**
  - Low conversion loss (typical 5.0 dB)
  - Good third-order intercept point (IP3) of 22 dBm
  - Excellent isolation: LO-RF isolation of 50 dB and LO-IF isolation of 45 dB
  - Rugged welded construction
  - RoHS compliant

**Typical Applications:**
The TUF-3HSM is commonly used in:
- **Defense and Federal Communications:** Due to its robust performance and reliability.
- **HF/VHF Communication Systems:** Ideal for applications requiring efficient signal mixing.
- **Signal Processing:** Used in various RF applications where frequency conversion is necessary, such as in receivers and transmitters.

This component is suitable for engineers and designers looking for a reliable frequency mixer for RF applications, particularly in environments where temperature stability and low loss are critical.
