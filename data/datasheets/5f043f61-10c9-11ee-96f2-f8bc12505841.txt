It operates within a frequency range of DC to 1450 MHz, effectively attenuating higher frequency signals while allowing lower frequencies to pass through. This component is particularly useful in applications requiring harmonic rejection and signal conditioning.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:** Not specified; however, it is designed for RF applications.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified; power handling is indicated.
- **Power Consumption:** Maximum RF input power of 10 W at 25°C.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type:** FV1206 (small size).
- **Special Features:**
  - Excellent power handling capability (10 W).
  - Temperature stable performance.
  - LTCC (Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic) construction.
  - Protected by U.S. Patent 6,943,646.
  - RoHS compliant.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided data.

**Typical Applications:**
The LFCN-1450+ is commonly used in:
- VHF/UHF transmitters and receivers, where it helps in filtering out unwanted high-frequency signals.
- Laboratory equipment for signal processing and testing.
- Harmonic rejection applications to ensure clean signal transmission.

This low pass filter is ideal for applications where maintaining signal integrity is crucial, particularly in communication systems and RF circuit designs.
