Based on the provided text, it appears that the information is not directly related to the component with the product code 221297 from NEXTRONICS ENGINEERING CORP. Instead, the text seems to describe a technical drawing or assembly instructions for a product (UGAF900) that includes various parts and components.

Since the specific details about the component with the product code 221297 are not present in the text, I cannot provide a summary of its key characteristics, specifications, or typical applications. 

To assist you accurately, I would need access to the actual datasheet or detailed specifications for the component with the product code 221297. If you have that information or can provide a different source, I would be happy to help analyze and summarize it.
