The SCL/SDA\nupstream pair fans out to two downstream pairs, or\nchannels. Either individual SCn/SDn channel or both\nchannels can be selected, determined by the contents\nof the programmable control register. Two interrupt\ninputs ( INT1 – INT0 ), one for each of the downstream\npairs, are provided. One interrupt output ( INT) acts as\nan AND of the two interrupt inputs.\nAn active-low reset ( RESET ) input allows the\nPCA9543A to recover from a situation where one of\nthe downstream I2C buses is stuck in a low state.\nPulling RESET  low resets the I2C state machine and\ncauses both of the channels to be deselected, as\ndoes the internal power-on reset function.\nThe pass gates of the switches are constructed such\nthat the VCC pin can be used to limit the maximum\nhigh voltage, which will be passed by the PCA9543A.\nThis allows the use of different bus voltages on\neach pair, so that 1.8-V, 2.5-V, or 3.3-V parts can\ncommunicate with 5-V parts without any additional\nprotection. External pull-up resistors pull the bus up\nto the desired voltage level for each channel. All I/O\npins are 5.5-V tolerant.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nPCA9543TSSOP (14) 5.00 mm × 4.40 mm\nSOIC (14) 8.65 mm x 3.91 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the datasheet.\nPCA9543ASlaves A , A ...A 0 1 N\nSlaves B , B ...B 0 1 NI2C or SMBus\nMaster\n(e.g. Processor)SDA\nSCL\nINT SD0SC0\nINT0Channel 0\nChannel 1RESET\nSD1\nSC1\nINT1VCC\nA0\nA1\nGND\nSimplified Application Diagramwww.ti.comPCA9543A\nSCPS169B – SEPTEMBER 2007 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9543APCA9543A\nSCPS169B – SEPTEMBER 2007 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The master SCL/SDA signal pair is directed\nto two channels of slave devices, SC0/SD0-SC1/SD1. Either individual downstream channel can be selected\nas well as both channels. The PCA9543A also supports interrupt signals in order for the master to detect an\ninterrupt on the INT output pin that can result from any of the slave devices connected to the INT1 - INT0  input\npins.\nThe device offers an active-low RESET  input which resets the state machine and allows the PCA9543A to\nrecover should one of the downstream I2C buses get stuck in a low state. The state machine of the device can\nalso be reset by cycling the power supply, V CC, also known as a power-on reset (POR). Either using the RESET\nfunction or causing a POR will cause both channels to be deselected.\nThe connections of the I2C data path are controlled by the same I2C master device that is switched to\ncommunicate with multiple I2C slaves. After the successful acknowledgment of the slave address (hardware\nselectable by A0 and A1 pins), a single 8-bit control register is written to or read from to determine the selected\nchannels and state of the interrupts.\nThe PCA9543A may also be used for voltage translation, allowing the use of different bus voltages on each\nSCn/SDn pair such that 1.8-V, 2.5-V, or 3.3-V parts can communicate with 5-V parts. This is achieved by using\nexternal pull-up resistors to pull the bus up to the desired voltage for the master and each slave channel.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nINTA0\nA1PCA9543A\nRESETSC16\n10\n5\n9\n7\n14\n3\n1312\n2\n11SC0\nSD0\nSD1\nGND\nVCC\nSCL\nSDA\nINT1INT0Input Filter\nOutput FilterI C Bus\nControl2\nInterrupt LogicSwitch Control Logic\nPower-On\nReset\n4\n81www.ti.comPCA9543A\nSCPS169B – SEPTEMBER 2007 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9543A\n8.3 Feature Description\nThe PCA9543A is a dual channel bidirectional translating switch for I2C buses that supports Standard-Mode\n(100 kHz) and Fast-Mode (400 kHz) operation. The PCA9543A features I2C control using a single 8-bit control\nregister in which bits 1 and 0 control the enabling and disabling of the two switch channels of I2C data flow.\nThe PCA9543A also supports interrupt signals for each slave channel and this data is held in bits 5 and 4 of\nthe control register. Depending on the application, voltage translation of the I2C bus can also be achieved using\nthe PCA9543A to allow 1.8-V, 2.5-V, or 3.3-V parts to communicate with 5-V parts. Additionally, in the event\nthat communication on the I2C bus enters a fault state, the PCA9543A can be reset to resume normal operation\nusing the RESET pin feature or by a power-on reset which results from cycling power to the device.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 RESET Input\nThe RESET  input can be used to recover the PCA9543A from a bus-fault condition. The registers and the I2C\nstate machine within this device initialize to their default states if this signal is asserted low for a minimum of t WL.\nBoth channels also are deselected in this case. RESET must be connected to V CC through a pull-up resistor.\n8.4.2 Power-On Reset\nWhen power (from 0 V) is applied to V CC, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9543A  in a reset condition\nuntil V CC has reached V POR. At that point, the reset condition is released and the PCA9543A  registers and\nI2C/SMBus state machine initialize to their default states. After that, V CC must be lowered to below 0.2 V and\nthen back up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle.\n8.5 Programming\n8.5.1 I2C Interface\nThe I2C bus is for two-way, two-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two lines are a serial\ndata line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be connected to a positive supply via a pull-up\nresistor when connected to the output stages of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not\nbusy.\nOne data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain stable during the high\nperiod of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time is interpreted as control signals (see Figure 8-1 ).\nSDA\nSCL\nData□Line\nStable;\nData□ValidChange\nof□data\nallowed\nFigure 8-1. Bit Transfer\nBoth data and clock lines remain high when the bus is not busy. A high-to-low transition of the data line while the\nclock is high is defined as the start condition (S). A low-to-high transition of the data line while the clock is high is\ndefined as the stop condition (P) (see Figure 8-2 ).\nSDASDA\nSCLSCL\nS P\nSTART□Condition STOP Condition\nFigure 8-2.

Also, a master\nmust generate an ACK after the reception of each byte that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The\ndevice that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the ACK clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable\nlow during the high pulse of the ACK-related clock period (see Figure 8-4 ). Setup and hold times must be taken\ninto account.\nA master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an acknowledge (NACK) after\nthe last byte has been clocked out of the slave. This is done by the master receiver by holding the SDA line high.\nIn this event, the transmitter must release the data line to enable the master to generate a stop condition.\nS1 2 8 9NACK\nACKData□Output\nby□Transmitter\nData□Output\nby□Receiver\nSCL From\nMaster\nStart\nConditionClock□Pulse□for\nAcknowledgment\nFigure 8-4.

Control Register\n8.6.3 Control Register Definition\nOne or both SCn/SDn downstream pairs, or channels, are selected by the contents of the control register (see\nTable 8-1 ). After the PCA9543A has been addressed, the control register is written. The two LSBs of the control\nbyte are used to determine which channel or channels are to be selected. When a channel is selected, the\nchannel becomes active after a stop condition has been placed on the I2C bus. This ensures that all SCn/SDn\nlines are in a high state when the channel is made active, so that no false conditions are generated at the time of\nconnection. A stop condition must occur always right after the acknowledge cycle.\nTable 8-1.

When an interrupt is generated by any device, it is detected by the PCA9543A and the interrupt\noutput is driven low. The channel does not need to be active for detection of the interrupt. A bit also is set in the\ncontrol register.\nBit 4 and Bit 5 of the control register correspond to the INT0  and INT1  inputs of the PCA9543A, respectively.\nTherefore, if an interrupt is generated by any device connected to channel 1, the state of the interrupt inputs is\nloaded into the control register when a read is accomplished. Likewise, an interrupt on any device connected\nto channel 0 would cause bit 4 of the control register to be set on the read. The master then can address\nthe PCA9543A and read the contents of the control register to determine which channel contains the device\ngenerating the interrupt. The master then can reconfigure the PCA9543A to select this channel, and locate the\ndevice generating the interrupt and clear it.\nIt should be noted that more than one device can provide an interrupt on a channel, so it is up to the master to\nensure that all devices on a channel are interrogated for an interrupt.\nThe interrupt inputs may be used as general-purpose inputs if the interrupt function is not required.\nIf unused, interrupt input(s) must be connected to V CC through a pull-up resistor.\nTable 8-2.

TI’s customers are responsible for determining\nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nApplications of the PCA9543A will contain an I2C (or SMBus) master device and up to two I2C slave devices.\nThe downstream channels are ideally used to resolve I2C slave address conflicts. For example, if two identical\ndigital temperature sensors are needed in the application, one sensor can be connected at each channel: 0 and\n1. When the temperature at a specific location needs to be read, the appropriate channel can be enabled and\nthe other channel switched off, the data can be retrieved, and the I2C master can move on and read the next\nchannel.\nIn an application where the I2C bus will contain many additional slave devices that do not result in I2C\nslave address conflicts, these slave devices can be connected to any desired channel to distribute the total\nbus capacitance across both channels. If both switches will be enabled simultaneously, additional design\nrequirements must be considered (See Design Requirements  and Detailed Design Procedure ).\n9.2 Typical Application\nA typical application of the PCA9543A will contain anywhere from 1 to 3 separate data pull-up voltages,\nVDPUX , one for the master device (V DPUM ) and one for each of the selectable slave channels (V DPU0 and\nVDPU1). In the event where the master device and both slave devices operate at the same voltage, then the\npass voltage, V pass = V DPUX. Once the maximum V pass is known, V cc can be selected using Figure 9-2 . In an\napplication where voltage translation is necessary, additional design requirements must be considered (See\nDesign Requirements ).\nFigure 9-1  shows an application in which the PCA9543A can be used.\nSD013\n11\n35\n96\n104\n82\n71SC0\nPCA9543AVDPU0= 2.3 V to 5.5 V\nVDPU1= 2.3 V to 5.5 VChannel 0\nChannel 1SDAVCC\nSCL\nI C/SMBus\nMaster2V = 3.3 VCCV = 2.3 V to 5.5 VDPUM\nINT INT0\nSD1\nSC1\nINT1RESET\nA1\nGNDA0SDA\nSCL12\nFigure 9-1.

If\nthe device generating the interrupt has an open-drain output structure or can be tri-stated, a pull-up resistor is\nrequired. If the device generating the interrupt has a push-pull output structure and cannot be tri-stated, a pull-up\nresistor is not required. The interrupt inputs should not be left floating in the application.\nThe A0 and A1 pins are hardware selectable to control the slave address of the PCA9543A. These pins may be\ntied directly to GND or V CC in the application.\nIf both slave channels will be activated simultaneously in the application, then the total I OL from SCL/SDA to\nGND on the master side will be the sum of the currents through all pull-up resistors, R p.\nThe pass-gate transistors of the PCA9543A are constructed such that the V CC voltage can be used to limit the\nmaximum voltage that is passed from one I2C bus to another.\nFigure 9-2  shows the voltage characteristics of the pass-gate transistors (note that the graph was generated\nusing data specified in the Electrical Characteristics  section of this data sheet). In order for the PCA9543A to act\nas a voltage translator, the V pass voltage must be equal to or lower than the lowest bus voltage. For example,\nif the main bus is running at 5 V and the downstream buses are 3.3 V and 2.7 V, V pass must be equal to or\nbelow 2.7 V to effectively clamp the downstream bus voltages. As shown in Figure 9-2 , Vpass(max)  is 2.7 V when\nthe PCA9543A supply voltage is 4 V or lower, so the PCA9543A supply voltage could be set to 3.3 V. Pull-up\nresistors then can be used to bring the bus voltages to their appropriate levels (see Figure 9-1 ).\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nOnce all the slaves are assigned to the appropriate slave channels and bus voltages are identified, the pull-up\nresistors, R p, for each of the buses need to be selected appropriately. The minimum pull-up resistance is a\nfunction of V DPUX, VOL,(max) , and I OL:\nDPUX OL(max)\np(min)\nOLV VRI/c45/c61\n(1)\nThe maximum pull-up resistance is a function of the maximum rise time, t r (300 ns for fast-mode operation, f SCL\n= 400 kHz) and bus capacitance, C b:\nr\np(max)\nbtR0.8473 C/c61/c180\n(2)\nThe maximum bus capacitance for an I2C bus must not exceed 400 pF for fast-mode operation. The bus\ncapacitance can be approximated by adding the capacitance of the PCA9543A, C io(OFF) , the capacitance of\nwires/connections/traces, and the capacitance of each individual slave on a given channel. If both channels will\nbe activated simultaneously, each of the slaves on both channels will contribute to total bus capacitance.PCA9543A\nSCPS169B – SEPTEMBER 2007 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9543A\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nVCC (V)Vpass (V)\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5012345\nD00725ºC (Room Temperature)\n85ºC\n-40ºC\nSpace  space space Space  space space\nFigure 9-2.

Power-on reset requires that the device go through a power cycle to be completely reset. This\nreset also happens when the device is powered on for the first time in an application.\nThe two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 10-1  and Figure 10-2 .\nVCC\nRamp-Up Re-Ramp-Up\nTime to Re-RampTimeRamp-Down\nVCC_RTVCC_RTVCC_FTVCC_TRR_GND\nFigure 10-1.

It is common to have a dedicated ground plane on an inner layer of the board and pins that are\nconnected to ground should have a low-impedance path to the ground plane in the form of wide polygon pours\nand multiple vias. By-pass and de-coupling capacitors are commonly used to control the voltage on the VCC pin,\nusing a larger capacitor to provide additional power in the event of a short power supply glitch and a smaller\ncapacitor to filter out high-frequency ripple.\nIn an application where voltage translation is not required, all V DPUX voltages and V CC could be at the same\npotential and a single copper plane can connect all of the pull-up resistors to the appropriate reference voltage.\nIn an application where voltage translation is required, V DPUM , VDPU0, and V DPU1, may all be on the same layer\nof the board with split planes to isolate different voltage potentials.\nTo reduce the total I2C bus capacitance added by PCB parasitics, data lines (SCn, SDn and INTn ) should be\na short as possible and the widths of the traces should also be minimized (e.g. 5-10 mils depending on copper\nweight).\n11.2 Layout Example\nA0\nA1\nRESET\nINT0\nSD0\nSC0\nGNDVCC\nSDA\nSCL\nINT\nSC1\nSD1\nINT1\nVDPU0VIA to Power PlanePartial Power Plane\nVDPU1VDPUMVIA to GND Plane (Inner Layer)Polygonal\nCopper Pour\nVCC\nGNDBy-pass/De-coupling\ncapacitors\nPCA9543AGNDTo I2C MasterTo Slave Channel 1To Slave Channel 0LEGENDPCA9543A\nSCPS169B – SEPTEMBER 2007 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9543A\n12 Device and Documentation Support\n12.1 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
