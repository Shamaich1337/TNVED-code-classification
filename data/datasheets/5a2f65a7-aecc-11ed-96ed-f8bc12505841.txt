The ADG728 is an8-channel matrix switch, while the ADG729 is a dual 4-channel\nmatrix switch. On resistance is closely matched between switches\nand very flat over the full signal range. These parts can operateequally well as either multiplexers, demultiplexers or switch\narrays and the input signal range extends to the supplies.\nThe ADG728 and ADG729 utilize a 2-wire serial interface that\nis compatible with the I\n2C™ interface standard. Both have two\nexternal address pins (A0 and A1). This allows the 2 LSBs of\nthe 7-bit slave address to be set by the user. Four of each of thedevices can be connected to the one bus. The ADG728 also hasa RESET  pin that should be tied high if not in use.\nEach channel is controlled by one bit of an 8-bit word. This\nmeans that these devices may be used in a number of differentconﬁgurations; all, any, or none of the channels may be on at\nany one time.\nOn power-up of the device, all switches will be in the OFF con-\ndition and the internal shift register will contain all zeros.\nAll channels exhibit break-before-make switching action pre-\nventing momentary shorting when switching channels.\nThe ADG728 and ADG729 are available in 16-lead TSSOP\npackages.PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1. 2-Wire Serial Interface.\n2. Single Supply Operation. The ADG728 and ADG729 are\nfully speciﬁed and guaranteed with 3 V and 5 V supply rails.\n3. Low On Resistance 2.5 Ω typical.\n4.

C\nADG728/ADG729\n–9–GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADG728 and ADG729 are serially controlled, 8-channel\nand dual 4-channel matrix switches respectively. While provid-ing the normal multiplexing and demultiplexing functions, these\ndevices also provide the user with more flexibility as to where\ntheir signal may be routed. Each bit of the serial word corre-\nsponds to one switch of the device. A Logic 1 in the particular\nbit position turns on the switch, while a Logic 0 turns the switch\noff. Because each switch is independently controlled by an indi-vidual bit, this provides the option of having any, all, or none of\nthe switches ON. This feature may be particularly useful in the\ndemultiplexing application where the user may wish to directone signal from the drain to a number of outputs (sources). Care\nmust be taken, however, in the multiplexing situation where a\nnumber of inputs may be shorted together (separated only bythe small on resistance of the switch).\nWhen changing the switch conditions, a new 8-bit word is writ-\nten to the input shift register. Some of the bits may be the same\nas the previous write cycle, as the user may not wish to changethe state of some switches. In order to minimize glitches on the\noutput of these switches, the part cleverly compares the state of\nswitches from the previous write cycle. If the switch is alreadyin the ON condition, and is required to stay ON, there will be\nminimal glitches on the output of the switch.\nPOWER-ON RESET\nOn power-up of the device, all switches will be in the OFF con-\ndition and the internal shift register is ﬁlled with zeros and willremain so until a valid write takes place.\nSERIAL INTERFACE\n2-Wire Serial Bus\nThe ADG728/ADG729 are controlled via an I2C compatible\nserial bus. These parts are con nected to this bus as a slave de vice\n(no clock is generated by the multiplexer).\nThe ADG728/ADG729 have different 7-bit slave addresses.\nThe ﬁve MSBs of the ADG728 are 10011, while the MSBs of\nthe ADG729 are 10001 and the two LSBs are determined bythe state of the A0 and A1 pins.\nThe 2-wire serial bus protocol operates as follows:1. The master initiates data transfer by establishing a START\ncondition which is when a high-to-low transition on the SDA\nline occurs while SCL is high. The following byte is theaddress byte, which consists of the 7-bit slave address fol-\nlowed by a R/ W bit (this bit determines whether data will be\nread from or written to the slave device).The slave whose address corresponds to the transmittedaddress responds by pulling the SDA line low during the\nninth clock pulse (this is termed the Acknowledge bit). Atthis stage, all other devices on the bus remain idle while the\nselected device waits for data to be written to or read from itsserial register. If the R/W bit is high, the master will readfrom the slave device. However, if the R/ W bit is low, the\nmaster will write to the slave device.\n2. Data is transmitted over the serial bus in sequences of nine\nclock pulses (eight data bits followed by an acknowledge bit).The transitions on the SDA line must occur during the low\nperiod of SCL and remain stable during the high period of\nSCL.\n3. When all data bits have been read or written, a STOP condition\nis established by the master. A STOP condition is deﬁned as\na low-to-high transition on the SDA line while SCL is high.\nIn Write mode, the master will pull the SDA line high duringthe 10th clock pulse to establish a STOP condition. In Read\nmode, the master will issue a No Acknowledge for the ninth\nclock pulse (i.e., the SDA line remains high). The master willthen bring the SDA line low before the tenth clock pulse and\nthen high during the tenth clock pulse to establish a STOP\ncondition.\nSee Figures 18 to 21 below for a graphical explanation of theserial interface.\nA repeated write function gives the user flexibility to update the\nmatrix switch a number of times after addressing the part only\nonce. During the write cycle, each data byte will update the con-ﬁguration of the switches. For example, after the matrix switch\nhas acknowledged its address byte, and receives one data byte,\nthe switches will update after the data byte, if another data byteis written to the matrix switch while it is still the addressed slave\ndevice, this data byte will also cause an switch conﬁguration\nupdate. Repeat read of the matrix switch is also allowed.\nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER\nThe input shift register is eight bits wide. Figure 15 illustratesthe contents of the input shift register. Data is loaded into the\ndevice as an 8-bit word under the control of a serial clock input,\nSCL. The timing diagram for this operation is shown in Figure 1.The 8-bit word consists of eight data bits each controlling one\nswitch. MSB (Bit 7) is loaded ﬁrst.\nS8 S7 S6 S5 S4 S3 S2 S1DB0 (LSB) DB7 (MSB)\nDATA BITS\nFigure 15. ADG728/ADG729 Input Shift Register Contents\nREV.
