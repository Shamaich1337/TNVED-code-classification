D For more information www.analog.comTYPICAL APPLICATION  FEATURES DESCRIPTION20V, 500mA , Ultralow Noise, \nUltrahigh PSRR Linear Regulator\nThe LT®3045  is a high performance low dropout linear \nregulator featuring L TC ’s ultralow noise and ultrahigh \nPSRR  architecture for powering noise sensitive applica -\ntions. Designed as a precision current reference followed \nby a high performance voltage buffer , the LT3045  can be \neasily paralleled to further reduce noise, increase output \ncurrent and spread heat on the PCB.\nThe device supplies 500mA  at a typical 260mV  dropout \nvoltage. Operating quiescent current is nominally 2.2mA  \nand drops to <<1µA in shutdown. The LT3045 ’s wide \noutput voltage range ( 0V to 15V) while maintaining unity-\ngain operation provides virtually constant output noise, \nPSRR, bandwidth and load regulation, independent of the \nprogrammed output voltage. Additionally, the regulator \nfeatures programmable current limit, fast start-up capa -\nbility and programmable power good to indicate output \nvoltage regulation.\nThe LT3045  is stable with a minimum 10µF  ceramic output \ncapacitor . Built-in protection includes reverse-battery \nprotection, reverse-current protection, internal current \nlimit with foldback and thermal limit with hysteresis. The \nLT3045  is available in thermally enhanced 12-Lead MSOP \nand 10-Lead 3mm  × 3mm  DFN packages.\nPower Supply Ripple RejectionAPPLICATIONS nUltralow RMS Noise : 0.8µV RMS (10Hz  to 100kHz )\n nUltralow Spot Noise : 2nV/√Hz at 10kHz\n nUltrahigh PSRR : 76dB  at 1MHz\n nOutput Current : 500mA\n nWide Input Voltage Range : 1.8V to 20V\n nSingle Capacitor Improves Noise and PSRR\n n100µA  SET Pin Current : ±1% Initial Accuracy\n nSingle Resistor Programs Output Voltage\n nHigh Bandwidth : 1MHz\n nProgrammable Current Limit\n nLow Dropout Voltage : 260mV\n nOutput Voltage Range : 0V to 15V\n nProgrammable Power Good\n nFast Start-Up Capability\n nPrecision Enable/UVLO\n nParallelable for Lower Noise and Higher Current\n nInternal Current Limit with Foldback\n nMinimum Output Capacitor : 10µF  Ceramic\n nReverse-Battery and Reverse-Current Protection\n n12-Lead MSOP and 10-Lead 3mm  × 3mm  DFN Packages\n nAEC- Q100  Qualified for Automotive Applications\n nRF Power Supplies : PLLs, VCOs, Mixers, LNAs, PAs\n nVery Low Noise Instrumentation\n nHigh Speed/High Precision Data Converters\n nMedical Applications : Imaging, Diagnostics\n nPrecision Power Supplies \n nPost-Regulator for Switching SuppliesAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\nV\nIN\n = 5V\nR\nSET\n = 30.1k\nC\nSET\n = 4.7µF\nC\nOUT\n = 10µF\nI\nL\n = 500mA\nFREQUENCY (Hz)\n10\n100\n1k\n10k\n100k\n1M\n10M\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\nPSRR (dB)\n3045 TA01b+\n–100µAIN\nEN/UV\nPG\nGNDOUTL T3045\nILIM PGFB\n402k10µF4.7µF*\n*OPTIONAL, SEE \n APPLICATIONS\n INFORMATIONVIN\n5V ±5%\n200k\n4.7µFVOUT\n3V\nIOUT(MAX)\n500mA\n49.9k\n3045 TA01a249/uni03A9\n30.1kSETOUTS\nDocument Feedback\nLT3045\n2\nRev.

Exposure to any Absolute \nMaximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device \nreliability and lifetime.\nNote 2 : The EN/UV pin threshold must be met to ensure device operation.\nNote 3 : Maximum junction temperature limits operating conditions. The \nregulated output voltage specification does not apply for all possible \ncombinations of input voltage and output current, especially due to the \ninternal current limit foldback which starts to decrease current limit at  \nVIN – VOUT > 12V. If operating at maximum output current, limit the input \nvoltage range. If operating at the maximum input voltage, limit the output \ncurrent range.\nNote 4 : OUTS ties directly to OUT .\nNote 5 : Dropout voltage is the minimum input-to-output differential \nvoltage needed to maintain regulation at a specified output current. The \ndropout voltage is measured when output is 1% out of regulation. This \ndefinition results in a higher dropout voltage compared to hard dropout \n— which is measured when V IN = VOUT(NOMINAL) . For lower output \nvoltages, below 1.5V, dropout voltage is limited by the minimum input \nvoltage specification. For DFN package : Linear Technology is unable to guarantee maximum dropout voltage specifications at high currents \ndue to production test limitations with Kelvin-sensing the package \npins.  Please consult the Typical Performance Characteristics  for curves \nof dropout voltage as a function of output load current and temperature \nmeasured in a typical application circuit.\nNote 6 : GND pin current is tested with V IN = VOUT(NOMINAL)  and a current \nsource load. Therefore, the device is tested while operating in dropout. This \nis the worst-case GND pin current. GND pin current decreases at higher \ninput voltages. Note that GND pin current does not include SET pin or ILIM \npin current but Quiescent current does include them.\nNote 7 : SET and OUTS pins are clamped using diodes and two 25Ω series \nresistors. For less than 5ms transients, this clamp circuitry can carry \nmore than the rated current. Refer to Applications Information  for more \ninformation.\nNote 8 : Adding a capacitor across the SET pin resistor decreases output \nvoltage noise. Adding this capacitor bypasses the SET pin resistor ’s \nthermal noise as well as the reference current ’s noise. The output noise \nthen equals the error amplifier noise. Use of a SET pin bypass capacitor \nalso increases start-up time.\nLT3045\n5\nRev.

In general, a battery ’s output impedance \nrises with frequency, so include a bypass capacitor in \nbattery-powered applications. While a 4.7µF  input bypass \ncapacitor generally suffices, applications with large load \ntransients may require higher input capacitance to prevent \ninput supply droop. Consult the Applications Information  \nsection on the proper use of an input capacitor and its effect \non circuit performance, in particular PSRR. The LT3045  \nwithstands reverse voltages on IN with respect to GND, \nOUTS and OUT . In the case of a reversed input, which oc -\ncurs if a battery is plugged-in backwards, the LT3045  acts \nas if a diode is in series with its input. Hence, no reverse \ncurrent flows into the LT3045  and no negative voltage \nappears at the load. The device protects itself and the load.\nEN/UV (Pin 3/Pin 4) : Enable/UVLO. Pulling the LT3045 ’s \nEN/UV pin low places the part in shutdown. Quiescent \ncurrent in shutdown drops to less than 1µA and the out -\nput voltage turns off. Alternatively, the EN/UV pin can set \nan input supply undervoltage lockout (UVLO) threshold \nusing a resistor divider between IN, EN/UV and GND. The \nLT3045  typically turns on when the EN/UV voltage exceeds \n1.24V  on its rising edge, with a 130mV  hysteresis on its \nfalling edge. The EN/UV pin can be driven above the input \nvoltage and maintain proper functionality. If unused, tie \nEN/UV to IN. Do not float the EN/UV pin.\nPG (Pin 4/Pin 5) : Power Good. PG is an open-collector \nflag that indicates output voltage regulation. PG pulls low \nif PGFB is below 300mV . If the power good functional -\nity is not needed, float the PG pin. A parasitic substrate \ndiode exists between PG and GND pins of the LT3045 ; do \nnot drive PG more than 0.3V below GND during normal \noperation or during a fault condition.\nILIM (Pin 5/Pin 6) : Current Limit Programming Pin. \nConnecting a resistor between ILIM and GND programs \nthe current limit. For best accuracy, Kelvin connect this \nresistor directly to the LT3045 ’s GND pin. The program -\nming scale factor is nominally 150mA •kΩ. The ILIM pin \nsources current proportional (1 :500) to output current ; therefore, it also serves as a current monitoring pin with \na 0V to 300mV  range. If the programmable current limit \nfunctionality is not needed, tie ILIM to GND. A parasitic \nsubstrate diode exists between ILIM and GND pins of the \nLT3045 ; do not drive ILIM more than 0.3V below GND \nduring normal operation or during a fault condition.\nPGFB (Pin 6 /Pin 7 ): Power Good Feedback. The PG pin \npulls high if PGFB increases beyond 300mV  on its rising \nedge, with 7mV hysteresis on its falling edge. Connect -\ning an external resistor divider between OUT , PGFB and \nGND sets the programmable power good threshold with \nthe following transfer function : 0.3V • (1 + R PG2/RPG1). \nAs discussed in the Applications Information  section, \nPGFB also activates the fast start-up circuitry. Tie PGFB \nto IN if power good and fast start-up functionalities are \nnot needed, and if reverse input protection is additionally \nrequired, tie the anode of a 1 N4148  diode to IN and its \ncathode to PGFB. See the Typical Applications  section for \ndetails.

This pin is the inverting input of \nthe error amplifier and the regulation set-point for the \nLT3045 . SET sources a precision 100µA  current that \nflows through an external resistor connected between SET \nand GND. The LT3045 ’s output voltage is determined by \nVSET = ISET •\xa0RSET. Output voltage range is from zero to \n15V. Adding a capacitor from SET to GND improves noise, \nPSRR and transient response at the expense of increased \nstart-up time. For optimum load regulation, Kelvin connect \nthe ground side of the SET pin resistor directly to the load. \nA parasitic substrate diode exists between SET and GND \npins of the LT3045 ; do not drive SET more than 0.3V below \nGND during normal operation or during a fault condition.\nGND (Pin 8, Exposed Pad Pin 11/Pin 9, Exposed Pad \nPin 13) : Ground.

Designed as a \nprecision current source followed by a high performance \nrail-to-rail voltage buffer , the LT3045  can be easily paral -\nleled to further reduce noise, increase output current and \nspread heat on the PCB. The device additionally features \nprogrammable current limit, fast start-up capability and \nprogrammable power good.\nThe LT3045  is easy to use and incorporates all of the pro -\ntection features expected in high performance regulators. \nIncluded are short-circuit protection, safe operating area \nprotection, reverse battery protection, reverse current \nprotection, and thermal shutdown with hysteresis.\nOutput Voltage\nThe LT3045  incorporates a precision 100µA  current source \nflowing out of the SET pin, which also ties to the error \namplifier ’s inverting input. Figure 1  illustrates that connect -\ning a resistor from SET to ground generates a reference \nvoltage for the error amplifier . This reference voltage is \nsimply the product of the SET pin current and the SET \npin resistor . The error amplifier ’s unity-gain configuration \nproduces a low impedance version of this voltage on its \nnoninverting input, i.e. the OUTS pin, which is externally \ntied to the OUT pin. \nThe LT3045 ’s rail-to-rail error amplifier and current refer -\nence allows for a wide output voltage range from 0V (us-\ning a 0Ω resistor) to V IN minus dropout — up to 15V. A \nPNP-based input pair is active for 0V to 0.6V output and an NPN-based input pair is active for output voltages greater \nthan 1.3V, with a smooth transition between the two input \npairs from 0.6V to 1.3V output. While the NPN-based input \npair is designed to offer the best overall performance, refer \nto the Electrical Characteristics  Table for details on offset \nvoltage, SET pin current, output noise and PSRR variation \nwith the error amp input pair . Table 1  lists many common \noutput voltages and their corresponding 1% R SET resistors.\nTable 1. 1% Resistor for Common Output Voltages\nVOUT (V) RSET (kΩ)\n2.5 24.9\n3.3 33.2\n5 49.9\n12 121\n15 150\nThe benefit of using a current reference compared with \na voltage reference as used in conventional regulators is \nthat the regulator always operates in unity gain configura -\ntion, independent of the programmed output voltage. This \nallows the LT3045  to have loop gain, frequency response \nand bandwidth independent of the output voltage. As a \nresult, noise, PSRR and transient performance do not \nchange with output voltage. Moreover , since none of the \nerror amp gain is needed to amplify the SET pin voltage \nto a higher output voltage, output load regulation is more \ntightly specified in the hundreds of microvolts range and \nnot as a fixed percentage of the output voltage.\nSince the zero TC current source is highly accurate, the \nSET pin resistor can become the limiting factor in achiev -\ning high accuracy. Hence, it should be a precision resistor . \nAdditionally, any leakage paths to or from the SET pin \ncreate errors in the output voltage. If necessary, use high \nquality insulation (e.g., Teflon, Kel-F) ; moreover , clean -\ning of all insulating surfaces to remove fluxes and other \nresidues may be required. High humidity environments \nmay require a surface coating at the SET pin to provide \na moisture barrier .\nMinimize board leakage by encircling the SET pin with a \nguard ring operated at a potential close to itself — ideally \ntied to the OUT pin.

While the LT3045  is robust enough \nnot to oscillate if the recommended layout is not followed, \ndepending on the actual layout, phase/gain margin, noise \nand PSRR performance may degrade. \nStability and Output Capacitance\nThe LT3045  requires an output capacitor for stability. \nGiven its high bandwidth, L TC recommends low ESR and \nESL ceramic capacitors. A minimum 10µF  output capaci -\ntance with an ESR below 20mΩ  and an ESL below 2nH is \nrequired for stability.  \nGiven the high PSRR and low noise performance attained \nusing a single 10µF  ceramic output capacitor , larger values \nof output capacitor only marginally improves the perfor -\nmance because the regulator bandwidth decreases with \nincreasing output capacitance — hence, there is little to \nbe gained by using larger than the minimum 10µF  output \ncapacitor . Nonetheless, larger values of output capacitance \ndo decrease peak output deviations during a load transient. \nNote that bypass capacitors used to decouple individual \ncomponents powered by the LT3045  increase the effective \noutput capacitance.3045 F0211OUT\nSET10\n9\n678\n4\n5321\nFigure 2. DFN Guard Ring LayoutFigure 3. COUT and C SET Connections for Best Performance\nSince the SET pin is a high impedance node, unwanted \nsignals may couple into the SET pin and cause erratic \nbehavior . This is most noticeable when operating with a \nminimum output capacitor at heavy load currents. By -\npassing the SET pin with a small capacitance to ground \nresolves this issue — 10nF  is sufficient.\nFor applications requiring higher accuracy or an adjust -\nable output voltage, the SET pin may be actively driven \nby an external voltage source capable of sinking 100µA . \nConnecting a precision voltage reference to the SET pin \neliminates any errors present in the output voltage due \nto the reference current and SET pin resistor tolerances.\nOutput Sensing and Stability\nThe LT3045 ’s OUTS pin provides a Kelvin sense connection \nto the output. The SET pin resistor ’s GND side provides a \nKelvin sense connection to the load ’s GND side.\nAdditionally, for ultrahigh PSRR, the LT3045  bandwidth \nis made quite high ( ~1MHz ), making it very close to a \ntypical 10µF  (1206 case size) ceramic output capacitor ’s \nself-resonance frequency ( ~1.6MHz ). Therefore, it is very \nimportant to avoid adding extra impedance (ESR and \nESL) outside the feedback loop. To that end, as shown in  \nFigure 3 , minimize the effects of PCB trace and solder \ninductance by tying the OUTS pin directly to C OUT and \nC\nOUT\nR\nSET\nC\nSET\nC\nIN\nOUT\nIN\nSET\nL T3045\nDEMO BOARD \nPCB LAYOUT \nILLUSTRATES \n4-TERMINAL\nCONNECTION \nTO C OUT\n100µA\nOUTS\nPG\nILIM\n3045 F03\nGND\nPGFB\nEN/UV\nV\nOUT\nI\nOUT(MAX)\n: 500mA\nV\nIN\nLT3045\n17\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nGive extra consideration to the type of ceramic capacitors \nused. They are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, \neach with different behavior across temperature and applied \nvoltage. The most common dielectrics used are specified \nwith EIA temperature characteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V , \nX5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics are good for \nproviding high capacitance in the small packages, but they \ntend to have stronger voltage and temperature coefficients \nas shown in Figure 4  and Figure 5 . When used with a 5V \nregulator , a 16V 10µF  Y5V capacitor can exhibit an effective \nvalue as low as 1µF to 2µF for the DC bias voltage applied \nover the operating temperature range. \nX5R and X7R dielectrics result in more stable character -\nistics and are thus more suitable for LT3045 . The X7R \ndielectric has better stability across temperature, while \nthe X5R is less expensive and is available in higher values. \nNonetheless, care must still be exercised when using \nX5R and X7R capacitors. The X5R and X7R codes only \nspecify operating temperature range and the maximum \ncapacitance change over temperature. While capacitance \nchange due to DC bias for X5R and X7R is better than \nY5V and Z5U dielectrics, it can still be significant enough \nto drop capacitance below sufficient levels. As shown in \nFigure 6 , capacitor DC bias characteristics tend to improve \nas component case size increases, but verification of \nexpected capacitance at the operating voltage is highly \nrecommended . Due to its good voltage coefficient in small \ncase sizes, L TC recommends using Murata ’s GJ8 series \nceramic capacitors.\nHigh Vibration Environments\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress upon \nit, similar to how a piezoelectric microphone works. For a \nceramic capacitor , this stress can be induced by mechanical \nvibrations within the system or due to thermal transients.\nLT3045  applications in high vibration environments have \nthree distinct piezoelectric noise generators : ceramic \noutput, input, and SET pin capacitors. However , due to \nLT3045 ’s very low output impedance over a wide fre -\nquency range, negligible output noise is generated using Figure 4. Ceramic Capacitor DC Bias Characteristics\nFigure 5.

D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\na ceramic output capacitor . Similarly, due to LT3045 ’s \nultrahigh PSRR, negligible output noise is generated \nusing a ceramic input capacitor . Nonetheless, given the \nhigh SET pin impedance, any piezoelectric response \nfrom a ceramic SET pin capacitor generates significant \noutput noise – peak-to-peak excursions of hundreds of \nµVs. However , due to the SET pin capacitor ’s high ESR \nand ESL tolerance, any non-piezoelectrically responsive \n(tantalum, electrolytic, or film) capacitor can be used at \nthe SET pin – although electrolytic capacitors tend to \nhave high 1/f noise. In any case, use of a surface mount \ncapacitor is highly recommended.\nStability and Input Capacitance\nThe LT3045  is stable with a minimum 4.7µF  IN pin capacitor . \nL TC recommends using low ESR ceramic capacitors. In \ncases where long wires connect the power supply to the \nLT3045 ’s input and ground terminals, the use of low value \ninput capacitors combined with a large load current can \nresult in instability. The resonant LC tank circuit formed by \nthe wire inductance and the input capacitor is the cause \nand not because of LT3045 ’s instability. \nThe self-inductance, or isolated inductance, of a wire \nis directly proportional to its length. The wire diameter , \nhowever , has less influence on its self-inductance. For \nexample, the self-inductance of a 2-AWG isolated wire \nwith a diameter of 0.26" is about half the inductance of a \n30-AWG wire with a diameter of 0.01". One foot of 30-AWG \nwire has 465nH  of self-inductance. \nSeveral methods exist to reduce a wire ’s self-inductance. \nOne method divides the current flowing towards the LT3045  \nbetween two parallel conductors. In this case, placing the \nwires further apart reduces the inductance ; up to a 50% \nreduction when placed only a few inches apart. Splitting \nthe wires connect two equal inductors in parallel. However , \nwhen placed in close proximity to each other , their mu -\ntual inductance adds to the overall self inductance of the \nwires — therefore a 50% reduction is not possible in such \ncases. The second and more effective technique to reduce \nthe overall inductance is to place the forward and return \ncurrent conductors (the input and ground wires) in close \nproximity. T wo 30-AWG wires separated by 0.02" reduce \nthe overall inductance to about one-fifth of a single wire.If a battery mounted in close proximity powers the LT3045 , \na 4.7µF  input capacitor suffices for stability. However , if a \ndistantly located supply powers the LT3045 , use a larger \nvalue input capacitor . Use a rough guideline of 1µF (in \naddition to the 4.7µF  minimum) per 6" of wire length. \nThe minimum input capacitance needed to stabilize the \napplication also varies with the output capacitance as well \nas the load current. Placing additional capacitance on the \nLT3045 ’s output helps. However , this requires significantly \nmore capacitance compared to additional input bypassing. \nSeries resistance between the supply and the LT3045  input \nalso helps stabilize the application ; as little as 0.1Ω  to 0.5Ω  \nsuffices. This impedance dampens the LC tank circuit at \nthe expense of dropout voltage. A better alternative is to \nuse a higher ESR tantalum or electrolytic capacitor at the \nLT3045  input in parallel with a 4.7µF  ceramic capacitor .\nPSRR and Input Capacitance\nFor applications utilizing the LT3045  for post-regulating \nswitching converters, placing a capacitor directly at \nthe LT3045  input results in ac current (at the switching \nfrequency) to flow near the LT3045 . This relatively high-\nfrequency switching current generates a magnetic field \nthat couples to the LT3045  output, thereby degrading its \neffective PSRR. While highly dependent on the PCB, the \nswitching pre-regulator, the input capacitance, amongst \nother factors, the PSRR degradation can be easily over \n30dB  at 1MHz . This degradation is present even if the \nLT3045  is de-soldered from the board, because it ef -\nfectively degrades the PSRR of the PC board itself. While \nnegligible for conventional low PSRR LDOs, LT3045 ’s \nultrahigh PSRR requires careful attention to higher order \nparasitics in order to extract the full performance offered \nby the regulator.\nTo mitigate the flow of high-frequency switching current \nnear the LT3045 , the LT3045  input capacitor can be entirely \nremoved -- as long as the switching converter ’s output \ncapacitor is located more than an inch away from the \nLT3045 . Magnetic coupling rapidly decreases with increas -\ning distance. Nonetheless, if the switching pre-regulator \nis placed too far away (conservatively more than a couple \ninches) from the LT3045 , with no input capacitor present, \nas with any regulator, the LT3045  input will oscillate at the \nLT3045\n19\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nparasitic LC resonance frequency. Besides, it is generally a \nvery common (and a preferred) practice to bypass regula -\ntor input with some capacitance. So this option is fairly \nlimited in its scope and not the most palatable solution. \nTo that end, LTC recommends using the LT3045  demo \nboard layout for achieving the best possible PSRR perfor -\nmance. The LT3045  demo board layout utilizes magnetic \nfield cancellation techniques to prevent PSRR degradation \ncaused by this high-frequency current flow —while utilizing \nthe input capacitor. \nFiltering High Frequency Spikes\nFor applications where the LT3045  is used to post-regulate \na switching converter , its high PSRR effectively sup -\npresses any “noise ” present at the switcher ’s switching \nfrequency — typically 100kHz  to 4MHz . However , the very \nhigh frequency (hundreds of MHz) “spikes ” — beyond the \nLT3045 ’s bandwidth — associated with the switcher ’s \npower switch transition times will almost directly pass \nthrough the LT3045 . While the output capacitor is partly \nintended to absorb these spikes, its ESL will limit its ability \nat these frequencies. A ferrite bead or even the inductance \nassociated with a short (e.g. 0.5 ”) PCB trace between the \nswitcher ’s output and the LT3045 ’s input can serve as an \nLC-filter to suppress these very high frequency spikes.\nOutput Noise\nThe LT3045  offers many advantages with respect to noise \nperformance. T raditional linear regulators have several \nsources of noise. The most critical noise sources for a \ntraditional regulator are its voltage reference, error amplifier , \nnoise from the resistor divider network used for setting \noutput voltage and the noise gain created by this resistor \ndivider . Many low noise regulators pin out their voltage \nreference to allow for noise reduction by bypassing the \nreference voltage. \nUnlike most linear regulators, the LT3045  does not use a \nvoltage reference ; instead, it uses a 100µA  current refer -\nence. The current reference operates with typical noise \ncurrent level of 20pA /√Hz (6nA RMS over a 10Hz  to 100kHz  \nbandwidth). The resultant voltage noise equals the current \nnoise multiplied by the resistor value, which in turn is RMS \nsummed with the error amplifier ’s noise and the resistor ’s own noise of √4kTR  — whereby k = Boltzmann ’s constant  \n1.38 • 10–23J/K and T is the absolute temperature.\nOne problem that conventional linear regulators face is \nthat the resistor divider setting the output voltage gains up \nthe reference noise. In contrast, the LT3045 ’s unity-gain \nfollower architecture presents no gain from the SET pin \nto the output. Therefore, if a capacitor bypasses the SET \npin resistor , then the output noise is independent of the \nprogrammed output voltage. The resultant output noise \nis then set just by the error amplifier ’s noise — typically \n2nV/√Hz from 10kHz  to 1MHz  and 0.8µV RMS in a 10Hz  to \n100kHz  bandwidth using a 4.7µF  SET pin capacitor . Paral -\nleling multiple LT3045 s further reduces noise by √N, for \nN parallel regulators. \nRefer to the Typical Performance Characteristics  section \nfor noise spectral density and RMS integrated noise over \nvarious load currents and SET pin capacitances.\nSet Pin (Bypass) Capacitance : Noise, PSRR, T ransient \nResponse and Soft-Start\nIn addition to reducing output noise, using a SET pin bypass \ncapacitor also improves PSRR and transient performance. \nNote that any bypass capacitor leakage deteriorates the \nLT3045 ’s DC regulation. Capacitor leakage of even 100nA  \nis a 0.1% DC error . Therefore, L TC recommends the use \nof a good quality low leakage ceramic capacitor . \nUsing a SET pin bypass capacitor also soft-starts the output \nand limits inrush current. The RC time constant, formed \nby the SET pin resistor and capacitor , controls soft-start \ntime. Ramp-up rate from 0 to 90% of nominal V OUT is:\n tSS ≈ 2.3 • RSET • CSET (Fast Start-Up Disabled)\nFast Start-Up\nFor ultralow noise applications that require low 1/f noise \n(i.e. at frequencies below 100Hz ), a larger value SET pin \ncapacitor is required, up to 22µF . While this would normally \nsignificantly increase the regulator ’s start-up time, the \nLT3045  incorporates fast start-up circuitry that increases \nthe SET pin current to about 2mA during start-up. \nAs shown in the Block Diagram , the 2mA current source \nremains engaged while PGFB is below 300mV , unless the \nLT3045\n20\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nregulator is in current limit, dropout, thermal shutdown \nor input voltage is below minimum V IN.\nIf fast start-up capability is not used, tie PGFB to IN or to \nOUT for output voltages above 300mV . Note that doing \nso also disables power good functionality.\nENABLE/UVLO\nThe EN/UV pin is used to put the regulator into a mi -\ncropower shutdown state. The LT3045  has an accurate \n1.24V  turn-on threshold on the EN/UV pin with 130mV  \nof hysteresis. This threshold can be used in conjunction \nwith a resistor divider from the input supply to define an \naccurate undervoltage lockout (UVLO) threshold for the \nregulator . The EN/UV pin current (I EN) at the threshold from \nthe Electrical Characteristics  table needs to be considered \nwhen calculating the resistor divider network :\n VIN(UVLO)=1.24 V•1+REN2\nREN1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟+IEN•REN2\nThe EN/UV pin current (I EN) can be ignored if R EN1 is less \nthan 100k . If unused, tie EN/UV pin to IN.\nProgrammable Power Good\nAs illustrated in the Block Diagram , power good thresh -\nold is user programmable using the ratio of two external \nresistors, R PG2 and R PG1: \nVOUT(PG_THRESHOLD)=0.3V•1+RPG2\nRPG1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟–IPGFB•RPG2\nIf the PGFB pin increases above 300mV , the open-collector \nPG pin de-asserts and becomes high impedance. The \npower good comparator has 7mV hysteresis and 5µs of \ndeglitching. The PGFB pin current (I PGFB) from the Electrical \nCharacteristics  table must be considered when determining \nthe resistor divider network. The PGFB pin current (I PGFB) \ncan be ignored if R PG1 is less than 30k. If power good \nfunctionality is not used, float the PG pin. Please note that \nprogrammable power good and fast start-up capabilities \nare disabled for output voltages below 300mV .\nThe power good functionality is disabled in shutdown, \ni.e. when EN/UV is set to 0V. If power good functionality is desired in shutdown, tie the power good resistor (i.e. \nRPG in the Block Diagram ) between the PG pin and either \nthe EN/UV or OUT pins.\nExternally Programmable Current Limit\nThe ILIM pin ’s current limit threshold is 300mV . Connecting \na resistor from ILIM to GND sets the maximum current \nflowing out of the ILIM pin, which in turn programs the \nLT3045 ’s current limit. With a 150mA  • kΩ programming \nscale factor , the current limit can be calculated as follows :\n Current Limit=150mA•kΩ\nRILIM\nFor example, a 1kΩ resistor programs the current limit \nto 150mA  and a 2kΩ resistor programs the current limit \nto 75mA . For good accuracy, Kelvin connect this resistor \nto the LT3045 ’s GND pin.\nIn cases where IN-to-OUT differential is greater than 12V, \nthe LT3045 ’s foldback circuitry decreases the internal \ncurrent limit. As a result, internal current limit may over -\nride the externally programmed current limit level to keep \nthe LT3045  within its safe-operating-area (SOA). See the \nInternal Current Limit vs Input-to-Output Differential graph \nin the Typical Performance Characteristics  section.\nAs shown in the Block Diagram , the ILIM pin sources current \nproportional (1 :500) to output current ; therefore, it also \nserves as a current monitoring pin with a 0V to 300mV  \nrange. If external current limit or current monitoring is \nnot used, tie ILIM to GND.\nOutput Overshoot Recovery\nDuring a load step from full load to no load (or light \nload), the output voltage overshoots before the regulator \nresponds to turn the power transistor OFF . Given that there \nis no load (or very light load) present at the output, it takes \na long time to discharge the output capacitor . \nAs illustrated in the Block Diagram , the LT3045  incorporates \nan overshoot recovery circuitry that turns on a current \nsink to discharge the output capacitor in the event OUTS \nis higher than SET . This current is typically about 4mA. \nNo load recovery is disabled for input voltages less than \n2.5V or output voltages less than 1.5V.\nLT3045\n21\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIf OUTS is externally held above SET , the current sink \nturns ON in an attempt to restore OUTS to its programmed \nvoltage. The current sink remains ON until the external \ncircuitry releases OUTS.\nDirect Paralleling for Higher Current\nHigher output current is obtained by paralleling multiple \nLT3045 s. Tie all SET pins together and all IN pins together . \nConnect the OUT pins together using small pieces of PCB \ntrace (used as a ballast resistor) to equalize currents in \nthe LT3045 s. PCB trace resistance in milliohms/inch is \nshown in Table 2 . \nTable 2. PC Board T race Resistance \nWEIGHT (oz) 10mil WIDTH 20mil WIDTH\n1 54.3 27.1\n2 27.1 13.6\nT race resistance is measured in mΩ/in.\nThe small worst-case offset of 2mV for each paralleled \nLT3045  minimizes the required ballast resistor value. \nFigure 7  illustrates that two LT3045 s, each using a 20mΩ  \nPCB trace ballast resistor , provide better than 20% accurate \noutput current sharing at full load. The two 20mΩ  external \nresistors only add 10mV  of output regulation drop with a \n1A maximum current. With a 3.3V output, this only adds \n0.3% to the regulation accuracy. As has been discussed \npreviously, tie the OUTS pin directly to the output capacitor .\nMore than two LT3045 s can also be paralleled for even \nhigher output current and lower output noise. Paralleling \nmultiple LT3045 s is also useful for distributing heat on the \nPCB. For applications with high input-to-output voltage \ndifferential, an input series resistor or resistor in parallel \nwith the LT3045  can also be used to spread heat. \nPCB Layout Considerations\nGiven the LT3045 ’s high bandwidth and ultrahigh PSRR, \ncareful PCB layout must be employed to achieve full device \nperformance. Figure 8  shows a recommended layout that \ndelivers full performance of the regulator . Refer to the \nLT3045 ’s DC2491 A demo board manual for further details.\nFigure 8.

The ther -\nmal shutdown temperature is nominally 165°C with about \n8°C of hysteresis. For continuous normal load conditions, \ndo not exceed the maximum junction temperature ( 125°C \nfor E- and I-grades and 150°C for H- and MP-Grades). It \nis important to consider all sources of thermal resistance \nfrom junction to ambient. This includes junction-to-case, \ncase-to-heat sink interface, heat sink resistance or circuit \nboard-to-ambient as the application dictates. Additionally, \nconsider all heat sources in close proximity to the LT3045 .\nThe undersides of the DFN and MSOP packages have \nexposed metal from the lead frame to the die attachment. \nBoth packages allow heat to directly transfer from the die \njunction to the PCB metal to limit maximum operating \njunction temperature. The dual-in-line pin arrangement \nallows metal to extend beyond the ends of the package \non the topside (component side) of the PCB.\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PCB and its \ncopper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated through-\nholes can also be used to spread the heat generated by \nthe regulator . \nTable 3  and Table 4  list thermal resistance as a function \nof copper area on a fixed board size.

D For more information www.analog.comTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nOverload Recovery\nLike many IC power regulators, the LT3045  incorporates \nsafe-operating-area (SOA) protection. The SOA protection \nactivates at input-to-output differential voltages greater \nthan 12V. The SOA protection decreases the current limit \nas the input-to-output differential increases and keeps \nthe power transistor inside a safe operating region for \nall values of input-to-output voltages up to the LT3045 ’s \nabsolute maximum ratings. The LT3045  provides some \nlevel of output current for all values of input-to-output dif -\nferentials. Refer to the Current Limit curves in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics  section. When power is first \napplied and input voltage rises, the output follows the input \nand keeps the input-to-output differential low to allow the \nregulator to supply large output current and start-up into \nhigh current loads.\nDue to current limit foldback, however , at high input volt -\nages a problem can occur if the output voltage is low and \nthe load current is high. Such situations occur after the \nremoval of a short-circuit or if the EN/UV pin is pulled high \nafter the input voltage has already turned ON. The load \nline in such cases intersects the output current profile at \ntwo points. The regulator now has two stable operating \npoints. With this double intersection, the input power \nsupply may need to be cycled down to zero and brought \nback up again to make the output recover . Other linear \nregulators with foldback current limit protection (such as \nthe LT1965  and LT1963 A) also exhibit this phenomenon, \nso it is not unique to the LT3045 .Protection Features\nThe LT3045  incorporates several protection features for \nbattery-powered applications. Precision current limit and \nthermal overload protection protect the LT3045  against \noverload and fault conditions at the device ’s output. For \nnormal operation, do not allow the junction temperature \nto exceed 125°C (E-grade, I-grade) or 150°C (H-grade, \nMP-Grade).\nTo protect the LT3045 ’s low noise error amplifier , the SET-\nto-OUTS protection clamp limits the maximum voltage \nbetween SET and OUTS with a maximum DC current of \n20mA  through the clamp. So for applications where SET \nis actively driven by a voltage source, the voltage source \nmust be current limited to 20mA  or less. Moreover , to limit \nthe transient current flowing through these clamps during \na transient fault condition, limit the maximum value of the \nSET pin capacitor (C SET) to 22µF .\nThe LT3045  also incorporates reverse input protection \nwhereby the IN pin withstands reverse voltages of up to \n–20V without causing any input current flow and without \ndeveloping negative voltages at the OUT pin. The regulator \nprotects both itself and the load against batteries that are \nplugged-in backwards.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several \ndifferent input/output conditions can occur . The output \nvoltage may be held up while the input is either pulled to \nGND, pulled to some intermediate voltage, or left open-\ncircuit. In all of these cases, the reverse current protection \ncircuitry prevents current flow from output to the input. \nNonetheless, due to the OUTS-to-SET clamp, unless the \nSET pin is floating, current can flow to GND through the \nSET pin resistor as well as up to 15mA  to GND through \nthe output overshoot recovery circuitry. This current flow \nthrough the output overshoot recovery circuitry can be \nsignificantly reduced by placing a Schottky diode between \nOUTS and SET pins, with its anode at the OUTS pin.\nLT3045\n24\nRev.
