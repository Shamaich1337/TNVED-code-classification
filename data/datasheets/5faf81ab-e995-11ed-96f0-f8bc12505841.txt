The device is capable of \nproviding an output voltage of 12.6 V and delivering up to 30-W power from a single-cell Lithium battery.\nThe TPS61088 uses adaptive constant off-time peak current control topology to regulate the output voltage. In \nmoderate-to-heavy load condition, the TPS61088 works in the quasi-constant frequency pulse width modulation \n(PWM) mode. The switching frequency in PWM mode is adjustable ranging from 200 kHz to 2.2 MHz by an \nexternal resistor. In light load condition, the device has two operation modes selected by the MODE pin. When \nthe MODE pin is left floating, the TPS61088 works in pulse frequency modulation (PFM) mode. The PFM mode \nbrings high efficiency at the light load. When the MODE pin is short to ground, the TPS61088 works in forced \nPWM mode (FPWM). The FPWM mode can avoid the acoustic noise and other problems caused by the low \nswitching frequency. The TPS61088 implements cycle-by-cycle current limit to protect the device from overload \nconditions during boost switching. The switch peak current limit is programmable by an external resistor. The \nTPS61088 uses external loop compensation, which provides flexibility to use different inductors and output \ncapacitors. The adaptive off-time peak current control scheme gives excellent transient line and load response \nwith minimal output capacitance.www.ti.comTPS61088\nSLVSCM8D – MAY 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61088\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVIN\nS\nRQ\nVrefCompSW\nR5ILIM VINC3\nOVPPGND\nFBC1\nVOUTL1\ngm\nENCOMP\nC6Shutdown \nControlR2C2BOOT\nLDO\nVCC\nC5Deadtime \nControl LogicVOUT\nShutdown\nUVLO VINVOUT\nThermal \nShutdownShutdownVIN CompR3\nR4FSW\nR1CLMIT\nCLMITSS\nC7C4\nSW1/K\nComp\nSS VrefComp\nVrefON/\nOFF\nMODEMode \nSelectionAGND\nFigure 7-1. Functional Block Diagram\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Enable and Start-up\nThe TPS61088 has an adjustable soft start function to prevent high inrush current during start-up. To minimize \nthe inrush current during start-up, an external capacitor, connected to the SS pin and charged with a constant \ncurrent, is used to slowly ramp up the internal positive input of the error amplifier. When the EN pin is pulled \nhigh, the soft-start capacitor C SS (C7 in Figure 8-1 ) is charged with a constant current of 5 μA typically. During \nthis time, the SS pin voltage is compared with the internal reference (1.204 V), the lower one is fed into the \ninternal positive input of the error amplifier. The output of the error amplifier (which determines the inductor peak \ncurrent value) ramps up slowly as the SS pin voltage goes up. The soft-start phase is completed after the SS \npin voltage exceeds the internal reference (1.204 V). The larger the capacitance at the SS pin, the slower the \nramp of the output voltage and the longer the soft-start time. A 47-nF capacitor is usually sufficient for most \napplications. When the EN pin is pulled low, the voltage of the soft-start capacitor is discharged to ground.\nUse Equation 1  to calculate the soft-start time.TPS61088\nSLVSCM8D – MAY 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61088\nREF SS\nSS\nSSV C tIu (1)\nwhere\n•tSS is the soft start time\n•VREF is the internal reference voltage of 1.204 V\n•CSS is the capacitance between the SS pin and ground\n•ISS is the soft-start charging current of 5 µA\n7.3.2 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nThe UVLO circuit prevents the device from malfunctioning at low input voltage and the battery from excessive \ndischarge. The TPS61088 has both VIN UVLO function and VCC UVLO function. It disables the device from \nswitching when the falling voltage at the VIN pin trips the UVLO threshold V IN_UVLO  , which is typically 2.4 V. The \ndevice starts operating when the rising voltage at the VIN pin is 200 mV above V IN_UVLO . It also disables the \ndevice when the falling voltage at the VCC pin trips the UVLO threshold V CC_UVLO , which is typically 2.1 V.\n7.3.3 Adjustable Switching Frequency\nThis device features a wide adjustable switching frequency ranging from 200 kHz to 2.2 MHz. The switching \nfrequency is set by a resistor connected between the FSW pin and the SW pin of the TPS61088. A resistor must \nalways be connected from the FSW pin to SW pin for proper operation. The resistor value required for a desired \nfrequency can be calculated using Equation 2 .\nOUT\nDELAY\nSW IN\nFREQ\nFREQV 14 ( t )¦ 9 RCu \x10 u\n \n(2)\nwhere\n•RFREQ is the resistance connected between the FSW pin and the SW pin\n•CFREQ is 23 pF\n•ƒSW is the desired switching frequency\n•tDELAY  is 89 ns\n•VIN is the input voltage\n•VOUT is the output voltage\n7.3.4 Adjustable Peak Current Limit\nTo avoid an accidental large peak current, an internal cycle-by-cycle current limit is adopted. The low-side switch \nis turned off immediately as soon as the switch current touches the limit. The peak switch current limit can be set \nby a resistor at the ILIM pin to ground. The relationship between the current limit and the resistance depends on \nthe status of the MODE pin.\nWhen the MODE pin is floating, namely the TPS61088, is set to work in the PFM mode at light load, use \nEquation 3  to calculate the resistor value:\nLIM\nILIM1190000IR \n(3)\nwhere\n•RILIM is the resistance between the ILIM pin and ground\n•ILIM is the switch peak current limit\nWhen the resistor value is 100 kΩ, the typical current limit is 11.9 A.\nWhen the MODE pin is connected to ground, namely the TPS61088 is set to work in forced PWM mode at light \nload, use Equation 4  to calculate the resistor value.www.ti.comTPS61088\nSLVSCM8D – MAY 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61088\nLIM\nILIM1190000I 1.6R \x10 (4)\nWhen the resistor value is 100 kΩ, the typical current limit is 10.3 A.\nConsidering the device variation and the tolerance over temperature, the minimum current limit at the worst case \ncan be 1.3 A lower than the value calculated by above equations.\n7.3.5 Overvoltage Protection\nIf the output voltage at the VOUT pin is detected above 13.2 V (typical value), the TPS61088 stops switching \nimmediately until the voltage at the VOUT pin drops the hysteresis value lower than the output overvoltage \nprotection threshold. This function prevents overvoltage on the output and secures the circuits connected to the \noutput from excessive overvoltage.\n7.3.6 Thermal Shutdown\nA thermal shutdown is implemented to prevent damages due to excessive heat and power dissipation. Typically, \nthe thermal shutdown happens at a junction temperature of 150°C. When the thermal shutdown is triggered, the \ndevice stops switching until the junction temperature falls below typically 130°C, then the device starts switching \nagain.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Operation\nThe synchronous boost converter TPS61088 operates at a quasi-constant frequency pulse width modulation \n(PWM) in moderate-to-heavy load condition. Based on the V IN to V OUT ratio, a circuit predicts the required \noff-time of the switching cycle. At the beginning of each switching cycle, the low-side N-MOSFET switch, as \nshown in Section 7.2, is turned on, and the inductor current ramps up to a peak current that is determined \nby the output of the internal error amplifier. After the peak current is reached, the current comparator trips. It \nturns off the low-side N-MOSFET switch and the inductor current goes through the body diode of the high-side \nN-MOSFET in a dead-time duration. After the dead-time duration, the high-side N-MOSFET switch is turned on. \nSince the output voltage is higher than the input voltage, the inductor current decreases. The high-side switch \nis not turned off until the fixed off-time is reached. After a short dead-time duration, the low-side switch turns on \nagain and the switching cycle is repeated.\nIn light load condition, the TPS61088 implements two operation modes, PFM mode and forced PWM mode, to \nmeet different application requirements. The operation mode is set by the status of the MODE pin. When the \nMODE pin is connected to ground, the device works in forced PWM mode. When the MODE pin is left floating, \nthe device works in PFM mode.\n7.4.1.1 PWM Mode\nIn forced PWM mode, the TPS61088 keeps the switching frequency unchanged in light load condition. When \nthe load current decreases, the output of the internal error amplifier decreases as well to keep the inductor peak \ncurrent down, delivering less power from input to output. When the output current further reduces, the current \nthrough the inductor decreases to zero during the off-time. The high-side N-MOSFET is not turned off even if \nthe current through the MOSFET is zero. Thus, the inductor current changes its direction after it runs to zero. \nThe power flow is from output side to input side. The efficiency is low in this mode. But with the fixed switching \nfrequency, there is no audible noise and other problems which might be caused by low switching frequency in \nlight load condition.\n7.4.1.2 PFM Mode\nThe TPS61088 improves the efficiency at light load with PFM mode. When the converter operates in light load \ncondition, the output of the internal error amplifier decreases to make the inductor peak current down, delivering \nless power to the load. When the output current further reduces, the current through the inductor decrease to \nzero during the off-time. Once the current through the high side N-MOSFET is zero, the high-side MOSFET is \nturned off until the beginning of the next switching cycle. When the output of the error amplifier continuously \ngoes down and reaches a threshold with respect to the peak current of I LIM / 12, the output of the error amplifier TPS61088\nSLVSCM8D – MAY 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61088\nis clamped at this value and does not decrease any more. If the load current is smaller than what the TPS61088 \ndelivers, the output voltage increases above the nominal setting output voltage. The TPS61088 extends its \noff-time of the switching period to deliver less energy to the output and regulate the output voltage to 0.7% \nhigher than the nominal setting voltage. With PFM operation mode, the TPS61088 keeps the efficiency above \n80% even when the load current decreases to 1 mA. In addition, the output voltage ripple is much smaller at light \nload due to low peak current.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe TPS61088 is designed for outputting voltage up to 12.6 V with 10-A switch current capability to deliver \nmore than 30-W power. The TPS61088 operates at a quasi-constant frequency pulse-width modulation (PWM) \nin moderate-to-heavy load condition. In light load condition, the converter can either operate in PFM mode or \nin forced PWM mode according to the mode selection. The PFM mode brings high efficiency over entire load \nrange, but PWM mode can avoid the acoustic noise as the switching frequency is fixed. The converter uses \nthe adaptive constant off-time peak current control scheme, which provides excellent transient line and load \nresponse with minimal output capacitance. The TPS61088 can work with different inductor and output capacitor \ncombination by external loop compensation. It also supports adjustable switching frequency ranging from 200 \nkHz to 2.2 MHz.\n8.2 Typical Application\nVIN\nENVOUT\nFBR1\nVCCFSWSW\nR2\nCOMP\nAGNDPGNDC6\nL1\nC1\nC2\nC3R3BOOTVIN = 3.3 to 4.2 V\nILIMR4\nSSC7C9VOUT = 9 V\nIOUT = 3 A\n10 µF1 µF1.2 µH0.1 µF\n2.2 µF0.1 µF255 k\r\n47 nF100 k\r56 k\r360 k\r\nMODER5C5C8\nOFFON3× 22 µFC4\nFigure 8-1.

Since the TPS61088 is configured to work in PFM mode in light load condition, use Equation 6  to calculate \nthe correct resistor value:\nLIM\nILIM1190000IR \n(6)\nwhere\n•RILIM is the resistance connected between the ILIM pin and ground\n•ILIM is the switching peak current limit\nFor a typical current limit of 11.9 A, the resistor value is 100 k Ω. Considering the device variation and the \ntolerance over temperature, the minimum current limit at the worst case can be 1.3 A lower than the value \ncalculated by Equation 6 . The minimum current limit must be higher than the required peak switch current at the \nlowest input voltage and the highest output power to make sure the TPS61088 does not hit the current limit and \ncan still regulate the output voltage in these conditions.\n8.2.2.4 Setting Output Voltage\nThe output voltage is set by an external resistor divider (R1, R2 in Figure 8-1 ). Typically, a minimum current of \n20 μA flowing through the feedback divider gives good accuracy and noise covering. A standard 56-k Ω resistor \nis typically selected for low-side resistor R2.www.ti.comTPS61088\nSLVSCM8D – MAY 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61088\nThe value of R1 is then calculated as:\nOUT REF 2\n1\nREF(V V ) RRV\x10 u  \n(7)\n8.2.2.5 Inductor Selection\nBecause the selection of the inductor affects the steady state operation of the power supply, transient behavior, \nloop stability, and boost converter efficiency, the inductor is the most important component in switching power \nregulator design. Three most important specifications to the performance of the inductor are the inductor value, \nDC resistance, and saturation current.\nThe TPS61088 is designed to work with inductor values between 0.47 and 10 µH. A 0.47-µH inductor is typically \navailable in a smaller or lower-profile package, while a 10-µH inductor produces lower inductor current ripple. If \nthe boost output current is limited by the peak current protection of the IC, using a 10-µH inductor can maximize \nthe output current capability of the controller.\nInductor values can have ±20% or even ±30% tolerance with no current bias. When the inductor current \napproaches saturation level, its inductance can decrease 20% to 35% from the value at 0-A current depending \non how the inductor vendor defines saturation. When selecting an inductor, make sure its rated current, \nespecially the saturation current, is larger than its peak current during the operation.\nFollow Equation 8  to Equation 10  to calculate the peak current of the inductor. To calculate the current in \nthe worst case, use the minimum input voltage, maximum output voltage, and maximum load current of the \napplication. To leave enough design margin, TI recommends using the minimum switching frequency, the \ninductor value with –30% tolerance, and a low-power conversion efficiency for the calculation.\nIn a boost regulator, calculate the inductor DC current as in Equation 8 .\nOUT OUT\nDC\nINV I IVu uK\n(8)\nwhere\n•VOUT is the output voltage of the boost regulator\n•IOUT is the output current of the boost regulator\n•VIN is the input voltage of the boost regulator\n•η is the power conversion efficiency\nCalculate the inductor current peak-to-peak ripple as in Equation 9 .\nPP\nSW\nOUT IN IN1I1 1 / \x0b \x0c ¦V V V \nu \x0e u\x10\n(9)\nwhere\n•IPP is the inductor peak-to-peak ripple\n•L is the inductor value\n•ƒSW is the switching frequency\n•VOUT is the output voltage\n•VIN is the input voltage\nTherefore, the peak current, I Lpeak, seen by the inductor is calculated with Equation 10 .\nPP\nLpeak DCII I 2 \x0e \n(10)TPS61088\nSLVSCM8D – MAY 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61088\nSet the current limit of the TPS61088 higher than the peak current I Lpeak. Then select the inductor with saturation \ncurrent higher than the setting current limit.\nBoost converter efficiency is dependent on the resistance of its current path, the switching loss associated with \nthe switching MOSFETs, and the core loss of the inductor. The TPS61088 has optimized the internal switch \nresistance. However, the overall efficiency is affected significantly by the DC resistance (DCR) of the inductor, \nequivalent series resistance (ESR) at the switching frequency, and the core loss. Core loss is related to the core \nmaterial and different inductors have different core loss. For a certain inductor, larger current ripple generates \nhigher DCR and ESR conduction losses and higher core loss. Usually, a data sheet of an inductor does not \nprovide the ESR and core loss information. If needed, consult the inductor vendor for detailed information. \nGenerally, TI would recommend an inductor with lower DCR and ESR. However, there is a tradeoff among the \ninductance of the inductor, DCR and ESR resistance, and its footprint. Furthermore, shielded inductors typically \nhave higher DCR than unshielded inductors. Table 8-2  lists recommended inductors for the TPS61088. Verify \nwhether the recommended inductor can support your target application with the previous calculations and bench \nevaluation. In this application, the Sumida\'s inductor CDMC8D28NP-1R2MC is selected for its small size and \nlow DCR.\nTable 8-2.

The VIN pin is the power supply for \nthe TPS61088. A 0.1- μF ceramic bypass capacitor is recommended as close as possible to the VIN pin of the \nTPS61088. The VCC pin is the output of the internal LDO. A ceramic capacitor of more than 1.0 μF is required at \nthe VCC pin to get a stable operation of the LDO.\nFor the power stage, because of the inductor current ripple, the input voltage changes if there is parasite \ninductance and resistance between the power supply and the inductor. It is recommended to have enough input \ncapacitance to make the input voltage ripple less than 100mV. Generally, 10- μF input capacitance is sufficient for \nmost applications.\nNote\nDC bias effect: High-capacitance ceramic capacitors have a DC bias effect, which has a strong \ninfluence on the final effective capacitance. Therefore, the right capacitor value must be chosen \ncarefully. The differences between the rated capacitor value and the effective capacitance result from \npackage size and voltage rating in combination with material. A 10-V rated 0805 capacitor with 10 μF \ncan have an effective capacitance of less 5 μF at an output voltage of 5 V.\n8.2.2.7 Output Capacitor Selection\nFor small output voltage ripple, TI recommends a low-ESR output capacitor like a ceramic capacitor. Typically, \nthree 22- μF ceramic output capacitors work for most applications. Higher capacitor values can be used to \nimprove the load transient response. Take care when evaluating the derating of a capacitor under DC bias. \nThe bias can significantly reduce capacitance. Ceramic capacitors can lose most of their capacitance at \nrated voltage. Therefore, leave margin on the voltage rating to ensure adequate effective capacitance. From \nthe required output voltage ripple, use the following equations to calculate the minimum required effective \ncapacitance C OUT:www.ti.comTPS61088\nSLVSCM8D – MAY 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61088\nOUT IN_MIN OUT\nripple _ dis\nOUT SW OUT(V V ) I\nV9 ¦ &\x10 u \n u u (11)\nripple _ESR Lpeak C _ESRV I R  u \n(12)\nwhere\n•Vripple_dis  is output voltage ripple caused by charging and discharging of the output capacitor\n•Vripple_ESR  is output voltage ripple caused by ESR of the output capacitor\n•VIN_MIN  is the minimum input voltage of boost converter\n•VOUT is the output voltage\n•IOUT is the output current\n•ILpeak is the peak current of the inductor\n•ƒSW is the converter switching frequency\n•RC_ESR  is the ESR of the output capacitors\n8.2.2.8 Loop Stability\nThe TPS61088 requires external compensation, which allows the loop response to be optimized for each \napplication. The COMP pin is the output of the internal error amplifier. An external compensation network \ncomprised of resistor R5, ceramic capacitors C5 and C8 is connected to the COMP pin.\nThe power stage small signal loop response of constant off-time (COT) with peak current control can be \nmodeled by Equation 13 .\n\x0b \x0c O ESRZ RHPZ\nPS\nsense\nPS S 1 1 5 \x14 \' \x15 ¦ \x15 ¦G (S)S 2 R 1\x15 ¦ § · § · \x0e \x10 ¨ ¸ ¨ ¸ u \x10 u Su u Su © ¹ © ¹  u u\x0eu Su\n(13)\nwhere\n•D is the switching duty cycle\n•RO is the output load resistance\n•Rsense is the equivalent internal current sense resistor, which is 0.08 Ω\nP\nO O 2¦2 R C Su u\n(14)\nwhere\n•CO is output capacitor\nESRZ\nESR O1¦2 R C Su u\n(15)\nwhere\n•RESR is the equivalent series resistance of the output capacitor\n\x0b \x0c2\nO\nRHPZR 1 D¦2 L u \x10  Su\n(16)\nThe COMP pin is the output of the internal transconductance amplifier.

This input supply \nmust be well regulated.

If layout is not carefully done, the regulator could suffer from instability \nand noise problems. To maximize efficiency, switch rise and fall times are very fast. To prevent radiation of high-\nfrequency noise (for example, EMI), proper layout of the high-frequency switching path is essential. Minimize \nthe length and area of all traces connected to the SW pin, and always use a ground plane under the switching \nregulator to minimize interplane coupling.\nThe input capacitor needs to be close to the VIN pin and GND pin in order to reduce the I input supply ripple.\nThe layout should also be done with well consideration of the thermal as this is a high power density device. A \nthermal pad that improves the thermal capabilities of the package should be soldered to the large ground plate, \nusing thermal vias underneath the thermal pad.\n10.2 Layout Example\nThe bottom layer is a large ground plane connected to the PGND plane and AGND plane on top layer by vias.\nSW\nSW\nSWSW\nVOUT\nVOUT\nVOUTSS\nNC AGNDL1\nVIN\nBOOTFSW\nVCC\nEN\nMODEAGND\nFBCOMP\nVINPGND\nNC\nCIN\nPGNDVOUT\nCOUTILIM\nFigure 10-1.

The maximum-power-dissipation limit is determined using Equation 21 .\nA\nD(max)\nJA125 TPRT\x10 \n(21)\nwhere\n•TA is the maximum ambient temperature for the application.\n•RθJA is the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance given in the Thermal Information  table.\nThe TPS61088 comes in a thermally-enhanced VQFN package. This package includes a thermal pad that \nimproves the thermal capabilities of the package. The real junction-to-ambient thermal resistance of the package \ngreatly depends on the PCB type, layout, and thermal pad connection. Using thick PCB copper and soldering \nthe thermal pad to a large ground plate enhance the thermal performance. Using more vias connects the ground \nplate on the top layer and bottom layer around the IC without solder mask also improves the thermal capability.TPS61088\nSLVSCM8D – MAY 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61088\n11 Device and Documentation Support\n11.1 Device Support\n11.1.1 Third-Party Products Disclaimer\nTI\'S PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DOES NOT \nCONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT REGARDING THE SUITABILITY OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES \nOR A WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR ENDORSEMENT OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, EITHER \nALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ANY TI PRODUCT OR SERVICE.\n11.1.2 Development Support\n11.1.2.1 Custom Design with WEBENCH Tools\nClick here  to create a custom design using the TPS61088 device with the WEBENCH® Power Designer.\n1.Start by entering your V IN, VOUT and I OUT requirements.\n2.Optimize your design for key parameters like efficiency, footprint and cost using the optimizer dial and \ncompare this design with other possible solutions from Texas Instruments.\n3.WEBENCH Power Designer provides you with a customized schematic along with a list of materials with real \ntime pricing and component availability.\n4.In most cases, you will also be able to:\n•Run electrical simulations to see important waveforms and circuit performance,\n•Run thermal simulations to understand the thermal performance of your board,\n•Export your customized schematic and layout into popular CAD formats,\n•Print PDF reports for the design, and share your design with colleagues.\n5.Get more information about WEBENCH tools at www.ti.com/webench .\n11.2 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
