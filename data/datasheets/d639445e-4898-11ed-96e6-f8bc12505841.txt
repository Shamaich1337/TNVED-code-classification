This switch \nis designed on a submicron process that provides low power \ndissipation yet gives high switching speed, low on resistance, and low leakage currents. \nThe ADG719 can operate from a single-supply range of 1.8 V  \nto 5.5 V , making it ideal for use in battery-powered instruments \nand with the new generation of DACs and ADCs from Analog \nDevices, Inc.  \nEach switch of the ADG719 conducts equally well in both \ndirections when on. The ADG719 exhibits break-before-make \nswitching action. \nBecause of the advanced submicron process, −3 dB bandwidths \nof greater than 200 MHz can be achieved. \nThe ADG719 is available in a 6-lead SOT-23 package and an  \n8-lead MSOP package. PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. 1.8 V to 5.5 V Single-Supply Operation. The ADG719 \noffers high performance, including low on resistance and \nfast switching times, and is fully specified and guaranteed with 3 V and 5 V supply rails. \n2. Ver y Low R\nON (4 Ω Max at 5 V and 10 Ω Max at 3 V). At 1.8 V \noperation, R ON is typically 40 Ω over the temperature range. \n3. Automotive Temperature Range: −40°C to +125°C. \n4. On Resistance Flatness (R FLAT(ON) ) (0.75 Ω typ). \n5. −3 dB Bandwidth > 200 MHz. \n6. Low Power Dissipation. CMOS construction ensures low \npower dissipation. \n7. Fast t ON/tOFF. \n8. Tiny, 6-lead SOT-23 and 8-lead MSOP packages. \n \n \nADG719  \n \nRev.

D | Page 12 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe ADG719 belongs to Analog Devices’ new family of CMOS \nswitches. This series of general-purpose switches has improved switching times, lower on resistance, higher bandwidths, low \npower consumption, and low leakage currents. \nADG719 SUPPLY VOLTAGES \nFunctionality of the ADG719 extends from 1.8 V to 5.5 V single \nsupply, which makes it ideal for battery-powered instruments \nwhere power efficiency and performance are important design \nparameters. \nIt is important to note that the supply voltage effects the input \nsignal range, the on resistance, and the switching times of the \npart. By taking a look at the Typical Performance Characteristics \nand the Specifications, the effects of the power supplies can be \nclearly seen. \nFor V DD = 1.8 V operation, R ON is typically 40 Ω over the \ntemperature range. \nON RESPONSE VS. FREQUENCY \nFigure 22  illustrates the parasitic components that affect the ac \nperformance of CMOS switches (the switch is shown surrounded \nby a box). Additional external capacitances will further degrade \nsome performance. These capacitances affect feedthrough, \ncrosstalk, and system bandwidth. \nS\nCDD\nVOUT\nRLOAD CLOAD VINRONCDS\n08708-022 \nFigure 22. Switch Represented by Equivalent Parasitic Components \nThe transfer function that describes the equivalent diagram of the switch ( Figure 22 ) is of the form A(s) shown below: \n⎥⎥\n⎦⎤\n⎢⎢\n⎣⎡\n++=1 ) (1 ) () (\nT ON TDS ON\nTC R R sC R sR s A  \nwhere: \nRT = R LOAD/(R LOAD + R ON) \nCT = C LOAD + C D + C DS \nThe signal transfer characteristic is dependent on the switch \nchannel capacitance, CDS. This capacitance creates a frequency \nzero in the numerator of the transfer function A(s). Because the switch on resistance is small, this zero usually occurs at high \nfrequencies. The bandwidth is a function of the switch output capacitance combined with \nCDS and the load capacitance. The \nfrequency pole corresponding to these capacitances appears in the denominator of \nA(s). \nThe dominant effect of the output capacitance, CD, causes the \npole breakpoint frequency to occur first. Therefore, in order to maximize bandwidth, a switch must have a low input and output capacitance and low on resistance. The On Response vs. \nFrequency plot for the ADG719 can be seen in Figure 12 . \nOFF ISOLATION \nOff isolation is a measure of the input signal coupled through \nan off switch to the switch output. The capacitance, CDS, couples \nthe input signal to the output load when the switch is off, as \nshown in Figure 23 . \nS\nCDD\nVOUT\nRLOAD CLOAD VINCDS\n08708-023 \nFigure 23. Off Isolation Is Affected by External Load Resistance and \nCapacitance \nThe larger the value of CDS, the larger the values of feedthrough \nthat will be produced. Figure 10  illustrates the drop in off \nisolation as a function of frequency. From dc to roughly 200 kHz, \nthe switch shows better than −95 dB isolation. Up to frequencies of \n10 MHz, the off isolation remains better than −67 dB. As the frequency increases, more and more of the input signal is coupled through to the output. Off isolation can be maximized by choosing a switch with the smallest \nCDS possible. The values of load resistance \nand capacitance also affect off isolation, since they contribute to the coefficients of the poles and zeros in the transfer function of \nthe switch when open. \n⎥⎥\n⎦⎤\n⎢⎢\n⎣⎡\n+ + +=1 ) ( ) () () (\nDS D LOAD LOADDS LOAD\nC C C R sC R ss A  \n \n \n  ADG719\n \nRev.
