Additionally, it features gain flatness of 0.1 dB to 14 MHz while offering differential \ngain and phase error of 0.04% and 0.06° on a single 5 V supply. \nThis combination of features makes the AD8042 useful for \nprofessional video electronics, such as cameras, video switchers, or any high speed portable equipment. The low distortion and fast settling of the AD8042 make it ideal for buffering single-supply, high speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). \nThe AD8042 offers a low power supply current of 12 mA \nmaximum and can run on a single 3.3 V power supply. These \nfeatures are ideally suited for portable and battery-powered \napplications where size and power are critical. \nThe wide bandwidth of 160 MHz along with 200 V/μs of slew \nrate on a single 5 V supply make the AD8042 useful in many \ngeneral-purpose, high speed applications where single supplies \nfrom +3.3 V to +12 V and dual power supplies of up to ±6 V are needed. The AD8042 is available in 8-lead PDIP and 8-lead \nSOIC_N packages. \n15\n12\n9\n6\n3\n0\n–3\n–6\n–9\n–12\n–15\n1 500 100 10CLOSED-LOOP GAIN (dB)\nFREQUENCY (MHz)\n01059-003VS = 5V\nG = +1\nCL = 5pF\nRL = 2kΩ TO 2.5V\n \nFigure 3.

This is a stress \nrating only; functional operation of the device at these or any \nother conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute \nmaximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability. \nMAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION \nThe maximum power that can be safely dissipated by the \nAD8042 is limited by the associated rise in junction temperature. \nThe maximum safe junction temperature for plastic encapsulated \ndevices is determined by the glass transition temperature of the plastic, approximately 150°C. Exceeding this limit temporarily \ncan cause a shift in parametric performance due to a change in the stresses exerted on the die by the package. Exceeding a junction temperature of 175°C for an extended \nperiod can result in device failure. \nWhile the AD8042 is internally short-circuit protected, this  \nmay not be sufficient to guarantee that the maximum junction \ntemperature (150°C) is not exceeded under all conditions. To \nensure proper operation, it is necessary to observe the \nmaximum power derating curves. \n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n–50 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 –10 –20 –30 –40MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE (°C)\n01059-004 8-LEAD PLASTIC-DIP PACKAGE\n 8-LEAD SOIC PACKAGETJ = 150°C\n \nFigure 4.

E | Page 12 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8042 is fabricated on the Analog Devices, Inc., \nproprietary eXtra-Fast Complementary Bipolar (XFCB) \nprocess, which enables the construction of PNP and NPN \ntransistors with similar f ts in the 2 GHz to 4 GHz region. The \nprocess is dielectrically isolated to eliminate the parasitic and \nlatch-up problems caused by junction isolation. These features \nallow the construction of high frequency, low distortion amplifiers with low supply currents. This design uses a \ndifferential output input stage to maximize bandwidth and headroom (see \nFigure 35 ). The smaller signal swings required \non the first stage outputs (nodes SIP , SIN) reduce the effect of \nnonlinear currents due to junction capacitances and improve \nthe distortion performance. With this design, harmonic distortion of better than −77 dB @ 1 MHz into 100 Ω with V\nOUT = 2 V p-p \n(gain = +2) on a single 5 V supply is achieved.  \n01059-036SIN\nR21 R3VEE\nQ11\nQ3I10\nR26 R39\nQ5 Q4\nQ40\nI7R2 R15\nQ13 Q17\nR5 C7Q2SIPQ22\nQ7\nQ21\nQ24R23 R27I2 I3 I1\nQ51Q25 Q50\nQ39\nQ47Q27Q31Q23I9\nI5\nVEE\nVCCI8Q36\nQ8VOUTC3\nC9VCC\nVINP\nVINN\nVEE \nFigure 35. Simpli fied Schematic \nThe rail-to-rail output range of the AD8042 is provided by a \ncomplementary common-emitter output stage. High output \ndrive capability is provided by injecting all output stage predriver \ncurrents directly into the bases of the output devices Q8 and \nQ36. Biasing of Q8 and Q36 is accomplished by I8 and I5, along \nwith a common-mode feedback loop (not shown). This circuit topology allows the AD8042 to drive 40 mA of output current \nwith the outputs within 0.5 V of the supply rails. \nOn the input side, the device can handle voltages from 0.2 V \nbelow the negative rail to within 1.2 V of the positive rail. \nExceeding these values does not cause phase reversal; however, \nthe input ESD devices do begin to conduct if the input voltages exceed the rails by greater than 0.5 V .  DRIVING CAPACITIVE LOADS \nThe capacitive load drive of the AD8042 can be increased by \nadding a low valued resistor in series with the load. Figure 36  \nshows the effects of a series resistor on capacitive drive for \nvarying voltage gains. As the closed-loop gain is increased, the \nlarger phase margin allows for larger capacitive loads with less \novershoot. Adding a series resistor with lower closed-loop gains \naccomplishes the same effect. For large capacitive loads, the frequency response of the amplifier is dominated by the roll-off \nof the series resistor and capacitive load. \n1000\n100\n10\n15 24 3CAPACITIVE LOAD (pF)\nCLOSED-LOOP GAIN (V/V)\n01059-037CLRSVS = 5V\n200mV STEP WITH 90% OVERSHOOT\nRS = 20ΩRS = 5Ω\nRS = 0Ω\n \nFigure 36.

E | Page 13 of 16 Single-Supply Composite Video Line Driver \nThe two op amps of an AD8042 can be configured as a single-\nsupply dual line driver for composite video. The wide signal \nswing of the AD8042 enables this function to be performed \nwithout using any type of clamping or dc restore circuit, which \ncan cause signal distortion. \nFigure 38  shows a schematic for a circuit that is driven by a \nsingle composite video source that is ac-coupled, level-shifted \nand applied to both noninverting inputs of the two amplifiers. \nEach op amp provides a separate 75 Ω composite video output. To obtain single-supply operation, ac coupling is used throughout. \nThe large capacitor values are required to ensure that there is \nminimal tilting of the video signals due to their low frequency (30 Hz) signal content. The circuit shown was measured to have \na differential gain of 0.06% and a differential phase of 0.06°. \nThe input is terminated in 75 Ω and ac-coupled via C IN to a \nvoltage divider that provides the dc bias point to the input. \nSetting the optimal bias point requires some understanding  \nof the nature of composite video signals and the video \nperformance of the AD8042. \n+5V\n0.1µF\n8 3\n2\nVOUT\n4651\n710µF4.99kΩ\n4.99kΩ\n75Ω\n10kΩ\nRG\n1kΩRG\n1kΩ\nRF\n1kΩRF\n1kΩ\nRT\n75ΩRT\n75Ω\nRL\n75Ω75Ω\nCOAX\nVOUT\nRL\n75Ω\n220µF220µF\n1000µF\n0.1µF10µF\n1000µF\n0.1µFCOMPOSITE\nVIDEO IN\n01059-038 \nFigure 38. Single-Supply Composite Video Line Driver Using AD8042 \nSignals of bounded peak-to-peak amplitude that vary in duty \ncycle require larger dynamic swing capability than their peak-\nto-peak amplitude after ac coupling. As a worst case, the dynamic \nsignal swing required approaches twice the peak-to-peak value. The two bounding cases are for a duty cycle that is mostly low, \nbut occasionally goes high at a fraction of a percent duty cycle, \nand vice versa. \nComposite video is not quite this demanding. One bounding \nextreme is for a signal that is mostly black for an entire frame \nbut has a white (full intensity), minimum width spike at least \nonce per frame. The other extreme is for a video signal that is full white \neverywhere. The blanking intervals and sync tips of such a \nsignal have negative going excursions in compliance with \ncomposite video specifications. The combination of horizontal and vertical blanking intervals limit such a signal to being at its \nhighest level (white) for only about 75% of the time. \nAs a result of the duty cycle variations between the two extremes \npresented, a 1 V p-p composite video signal that is multiplied by \na gain of 2 requires about 3.2 V p-p of dynamic voltage swing at \nthe output for an op amp to pass a composite video signal of \narbitrary duty cycle without distortion. \nSome circuits use a sync tip clamp along with ac coupling to \nhold the sync tips at a relatively constant level, which lowers the \namount of dynamic signal swing required. However, these \ncircuits can have artifacts, such as sync tip compression, unless \nthey are driven by sources with very low output impedance. \nThe AD8042 not only has ample signal swing capability to handle \nthe dynamic range required without using a sync tip clamp but \nalso has good video specifications such as differential gain and \ndifferential phase when buffering these signals in an ac-coupled \nconfiguration. \nTo test the dynamic range, the differential gain and differential \nphase were measured for the AD8042 while the supplies were \nvaried. As the lower supply is raised to approach the video \nsignal, the first effect observed is that the sync tips become \ncompressed before the differential gain and differential phase are \nadversely affected. Therefore, there must be adequate swing in \nthe negative direction to pass the sync tips without compression. \nAs the upper supply is lowered to approach the video, the \ndifferential gain and differential phase was not significantly \naffected until the difference between the peak video output  \nand the supply reached 0.6 V . Therefore, the highest video level \nshould be kept at least 0.6 V below the positive supply rail.  \nTherefore, it was found that the optimal point to bias the \nnoninverting input is at 2.2 V dc. Operating at this point, the \nworst-case differential gain is measured at 0.06% and the worst-\ncase differential phase is 0.06°. \nThe ac-coupling capacitors used in the circuit at first glance \nappear quite large. A composite video signal has a lower frequency \nband edge of 30 Hz. The resistances at the various ac coupling \npoints, especially at the output, are quite small. To minimize \nphase shifts and baseline tilt, the large value capacitors are required. \nFor video system performance that is not to be of the highest quality, the value of these capacitors can be reduced by a factor of up to five with only a slightly observable change in the picture \nquality. \n \nAD8042  \n \nRev. E | Page 14 of 16 Single-Ended-to-Differential Driver \nUsing a cross-coupled, single-ended-to-differential converter \n(SEDC), the AD8042 makes a good general-purpose differential \nline driver. This SEDC can be used for applications such as \ndriving Category-5 (CAT-5) twisted pair wires. Figure 39  shows \na configuration for a circuit that performs this function that can be used for video transmission over a differential pair or various \ndata communication purposes.  \n01059-03910µF\n60.4Ω\n60.4Ω\n100ΩRF\n1kΩRIN\n1kΩ\n49.9Ω\nRA\n1kΩ\nRA\n1kΩRB\n1kΩRB\n1kΩ0.1µF\n50m\n121ΩAMP18 3\n2\n6\n57\n41VIN\nAMP2+5V\nVOUTAD8042\n10µF 0.1µF\n–5V \nFigure 39. Single-Ended-to-Differe ntial Twisted Pair Line Driver \nEach of the op amps of the AD8042 is configured as a unity gain \nfollower by the feedback resistors (R A). Each op amp output also \ndrives the other as a unity gain inverter via R B, creating a totally \nsymmetrical circuit. B\nIf the noninverting input of AMP2 is grounded and a small \npositive signal is applied to the noninverting input of AMP1, \nthe output of AMP1 is driven to saturation in the positive \ndirection and the input of AMP2 is driven to saturation in the negative direction. This is similar to the way a conventional op \namp behaves without any feedback. \nIf a resistor (R F) is connected from the output of AMP2 to the \nnoninverting input of AMP1, negative feedback is provided, which \ncloses the loop. An input resistor (R IN) makes the circuit look \nlike a conventional inverting op amp configuration with \ndifferential outputs. \nThe gain of this circuit from input to either output is ±R F/RIN, or \nthe single-ended-to-differential gain is 2 × R F/RIN. This gives the \ncircuit the advantage of being able to adjust its gain by changing \na single resistor.  \n The cable has a characteristic impedance of about 120 Ω. Each \ndriver output is back terminated with a pair of 60.4 Ω resistors \nto make the source look like 120 Ω. The receive end is terminated \nwith 121 Ω, and the signal is measured differentially with a pair of scope probes. One channel on the oscilloscope is inverted \nand then the signals are added. \nFigure 40  shows the results of the circuit in Figure 39  driving \n50 meters of CAT-5 cable. \nVIN\nVOUT\n01059-04050ns 1V\n100\n10\n0%90\n200mV200mV\n \nFigure 40.

HDSL Line Driver \nLAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS \nThe specified high speed performance of the AD8042 requires \ncareful attention to board layout and component selection. \nProper RF design techniques and low-pass parasitic component \nselection are necessary. \nThe PCB should have a ground plane covering all unused \nportions of the component side of the board to provide a low \nimpedance path. The ground plane should be removed from  \nthe area near the input pins to reduce the stray capacitance. Figure 42. FFT of the AD9220  Output When Driven by the AD8042 \nHDSL Line Driver \nHigh bit rate digital subscriber line (HDSL) is a popular means \nof providing data communication at DS1 rates (1.544 Mbps) \nover moderate distances via conventional telephone twisted pair \nwires. In these systems, the transceiver at the customer’s end is powered sometimes via the twisted pair from a power source at \nthe central office. Sometimes, it is required to raise the dc voltage  \nof the power source to compensate for IR drops in long lines or \nlines with narrow gauge wires. Chip capacitors should be used for the supply bypassing. One \nend should be connected to the ground plane and the other \nwithin ⅛-inch of each power pin.  An additional large (0.47 μF \nto 10 μF) tantalum electrolytic capacitor should be connected in \nparallel, but not necessarily so close to supply current, for fast, \nlarge signal changes at the output. \nThe feedback resistor should be located close to the inverting \ninput pin to keep the stray capacitance at this node to a \nminimum. Capacitance variations of less than 1 pF at the \ninverting input significantly affect high speed performance. Because of the IR drop, it is highly desirable to keep the power \nconsumption of the customer’s transceiver as low as possible. \nOne means to realize significant power savings is to run  \nthe transceiver from a ±5 V supply instead of the more \nconventional ±12 V . Stripline design techniques should be used for long signal  \ntraces (greater than approximately one inch). These should be designed with a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω or 75 Ω and \nbe properly terminated at each end.
