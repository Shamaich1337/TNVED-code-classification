B For more information www.analog.com Document FeedbackTYPICAL APPLICATION  FEATURES DESCRIPTION42V, 2.5A Synchronous \nStep-Down Regulator with \n2.5µA Quiescent Current\nThe LT®8610 is a compact, high efficiency, high speed \nsynchronous monolithic step-down switching regulator \nthat consumes only 2.5µA of quiescent current. Top and \nbottom power switches are included with all necessary \ncircuitry to minimize the need for external components. \nLow ripple Burst Mode operation enables high efficiency \ndown to very low output currents while keeping the output \nripple below 10mV P-P. A SYNC pin allows synchronization \nto an external clock. Internal compensation with peak cur-\nrent mode topology allows the use of small inductors and \nresults in fast transient response and good loop stability. \nThe EN/UV pin has an accurate 1V threshold and can be \nused to program VIN undervoltage lockout or to shut down \nthe LT8610 reducing the input supply current to 1µA. A \ncapacitor on the TR/SS pin programs the output voltage \nramp rate during start-up. The PG flag signals when VOUT \nis within ±9% of the programmed output voltage as well \nas fault conditions. The LT8610 is available in a small \n16-lead MSOP package with exposed pad for low thermal \nresistance.\n5V 2.5A Step-Down Converter12VIN to 5V OUT EfficiencyAPPLICATIONSn Wide Input Voltage Range: 3.4V to 42V\nn Ultralow Quiescent Current Burst Mode® Operation:\n  2.5μA I Q Regulating 12V IN to 3.3V OUT\n  Output Ripple < 10mV P-P \nn High Efficiency Synchronous Operation:\n  96% Efficiency at 1A, 5V OUT from 12V IN \n  94% Efficiency at 1A, 3.3V OUT from 12V IN \nn Fast Minimum Switch-On Time: 50ns\nn Low Dropout Under All Conditions: 200mV at 1A\nn Allows Use Of Small Inductors\nn Low EMI\nn Adjustable and Synchronizable: 200kHz to 2.2MHz\nn Current Mode Operation\nn Accurate 1V Enable Pin Threshold\nn Internal Compensation\nn Output Soft-Start and T racking\nn Small Thermally Enhanced 16-Lead MSOP Package\nn AEC-Q100 Qualified for Automotive Applications\nn Automotive and Industrial Supplies\nn General Purpose Step-Down\nn GSM Power Supplies\nBST VIN\nEN/UV\nPG\nSYNC\nINTV CCTR/SS\nRTSW\nL T8610\nGND PGNDBIAS\n8610 TA01aFB0.1µF\nVOUT\n5V\n2.5A4.7µFVIN\n5.5V TO 42V\n1µF10nF\n10pF4.7µH\n1M\n243k\nfSW = 700kHz60.4k47µF\nLOAD CURRENT (A)0EFFICIENCY (%)8090100\n2\n8610 TA01b70\n60758595\n65\n55\n50\n0.5 1 1.5 2.5VIN = 12V\nVIN = 24VfSW = 700kHzAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\nLT8610\n2\nRev.

B For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONSTYPICAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS\nStart-Up Dropout Performance Start-Up Dropout Performance\nSYNC ( Pin 1): External Clock Synchronization Input. \nGround this pin for low ripple Burst Mode operation at low \noutput loads. Tie to a clock source for synchronization to \nan external frequency. Apply a DC voltage of 3V or higher \nor tie to INTV CC for pulse-skipping mode. When in pulse-\nskipping mode, the IQ will increase to several hundred µA. \nDo not float this pin.\nTR/SS (Pin 2): Output T racking and Soft-Start Pin. This \npin allows user control of output voltage ramp rate during \nstart-up. A TR/SS voltage below 0.97V forces the LT8610 \nto regulate the FB pin to equal the TR/SS pin voltage. When \nTR/SS is above 0.97V, the tracking function is disabled \nand the internal reference resumes control of the error \namplifier. An internal 2.2μA pull-up current from INTV CC \non this pin allows a capacitor to program output voltage \nslew rate. This pin is pulled to ground with an internal 230Ω \nMOSFET during shutdown  and fault conditions ; use a series  \nresistor if driving from a low impedance output. This pin \nmay be left floating if the tracking function is not needed.\nRT (Pin 3): A resistor is tied between RT and ground to \nset the switching frequency.\nEN/UV (Pin 4): The LT8610 is shut down when this pin \nis low and active when this pin is high. The hysteretic \nthreshold voltage is 1.00V going up and 0.96V going \ndown. Tie to VIN if the shutdown feature is not used. An \nexternal resistor divider from VIN can be used to program \na VIN threshold below which the LT8610 will shut down.VIN (Pins 5, 6): The VIN pins supply current to the LT8610 \ninternal circuitry and to the internal topside power switch. \nThese pins must be tied together and be locally bypassed. \nBe sure to place the positive terminal of the input capaci -\ntor as close as possible to the VIN pins, and the negative \ncapacitor terminal as close as possible to the PGND pins.\nPGND (Pins 7, 8): Power Switch Ground. These pins are \nthe return path of the internal bottom-side power switch \nand must be tied together. Place the negative terminal of \nthe input capacitor as close to the PGND pins as possible. \nSW (Pins 9, 10, 11): The SW pins are the outputs of the \ninternal power switches. Tie these pins together and con-\nnect them to the inductor and boost capacitor. This node \nshould be kept small on the PCB for good performance.\nBST (Pin 12): This pin is used to provide a drive voltage, \nhigher than the input voltage, to the topside power switch. \nPlace a 0.1µF  boost capacitor as close as possible to the IC.\nINTV CC (Pin 13): Internal 3.4V Regulator Bypass Pin. \nThe internal power drivers and control circuits are pow-\nered from this voltage. INTV CC maximum output cur-\nrent is 20mA. Do not load the INTV CC pin with external \ncircuitry. INTV CC current will be supplied from BIAS if  \nVBIAS > 3.1V, otherwise current will be drawn from VIN. \nVoltage on INTV CC will vary between 2.8V and 3.4V when \nVBIAS is between 3.0V  and 3.6V .

B For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nThe LT8610 is a monolithic, constant frequency, current \nmode step-down DC/DC converter. An oscillator, with \nfrequency set using a resistor on the RT pin, turns on \nthe internal top power switch at the beginning of each \nclock cycle. Current in the inductor then increases until \nthe top switch current comparator trips and turns off the \ntop power switch. The peak inductor current at which \nthe top switch turns off is controlled by the voltage on \nthe internal VC node. The error amplifier servos the VC \nnode by comparing the voltage on the VFB pin with an \ninternal 0.97V reference. When the load current increases \nit causes a reduction in the feedback voltage relative to \nthe reference leading the error amplifier to raise the VC \nvoltage until the average inductor current matches the new \nload current.  When the top power switch turns off, the \nsynchronous power switch turns on until the next clock \ncycle begins or inductor current falls to zero. If overload \nconditions result in more than 3.3A flowing through the \nbottom switch, the next clock cycle will be delayed until \nswitch current returns to a safe level.\nIf the EN/UV pin is low, the LT8610 is shut down and \ndraws 1µA from the input. When the EN/UV pin is above \n1V, the switching regulator will become active.\nTo optimize efficiency at light loads, the LT8610 operates \nin Burst Mode operation in light load situations. Between \nbursts, all circuitry associated with controlling the output \nswitch is shut down, reducing the input supply current to \n1.7μA. In a typical application, 2.5μA will be consumed from the input supply when regulating with no load. The \nSYNC pin is tied low to use Burst Mode operation and can \nbe tied to a logic high to use pulse-skipping mode. If a \nclock is applied to the SYNC pin the part will synchronize to \nan external clock frequency and operate in pulse-skipping \nmode. While in pulse- skipping mode the oscillator operates  \ncontinuously and positive SW transitions are aligned to \nthe clock. During light loads, switch pulses are skipped \nto regulate the output and the quiescent current will be \nseveral hundred µA.\nTo improve efficiency across all loads, supply current to \ninternal circuitry can be sourced from the BIAS pin when \nbiased at 3.3V  or above. Else, the internal circuitry will draw  \ncurrent from VIN. The BIAS pin should be connected to \nVOUT if the LT8610 output is programmed at 3.3V  or above.\nComparators monitoring the FB pin voltage will pull the \nPG pin low if the output voltage varies more than ±9% \n(typical) from the set point, or if a fault condition is present.\nThe oscillator reduces the LT8610’s operating frequency \nwhen the voltage at the FB pin is low. This frequency \nfoldback helps to control the inductor current when the \noutput voltage is lower than the programmed value which \noccurs during start-up or overcurrent conditions. When \na clock is applied to the SYNC pin or the SYNC pin is \nheld DC high, the frequency foldback is disabled and the \nswitching frequency will slow down only during overcur -\nrent conditions.\nLT8610\n11\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nAchieving Ultralow Quiescent Current\nTo enhance efficiency at light loads, the LT8610 operates \nin low ripple Burst Mode operation, which keeps the out-\nput capacitor charged to the desired output voltage while \nminimizing the input quiescent current and minimizing \noutput voltage ripple. In Burst Mode operation the LT8610 \ndelivers single small pulses of current to the output capaci -\ntor followed by sleep periods where the output power is \nsupplied by the output capacitor. While in sleep mode the \nLT8610 consumes 1.7μA.\nAs the output load decreases, the frequency of single cur-\nrent pulses decreases (see Figure 1a) and the percentage \nof time the LT8610 is in sleep mode increases, resulting in much higher light load efficiency than for typical convert -\ners. By maximizing the time between pulses, the converter \nquiescent  current  approaches  2.5µA for a typical  application  \nwhen there is no output load. Therefore, to optimize the \nquiescent current performance at light loads, the current \nin the feedback resistor divider must be minimized as it \nappears to the output as load current. \nWhile in Burst Mode operation the current limit of the top \nswitch is approximately 400mA resulting in output voltage \nripple shown in Figure 2. Increasing the output capacitance  \nwill decrease the output ripple proportionally. As load ramps  \nupward from zero the switching frequency will increase \nbut only up to the switching frequency programmed by \nthe resistor at the RT pin as shown in Figure 1a. The out-\nput load at which the LT8610 reaches the programmed \nfrequency varies based on input voltage, output voltage, \nand inductor choice.\nFor some applications it is desirable for the LT8610 to \noperate in pulse-skipping mode, offering two major differ -\nences from Burst Mode operation. First is the clock stays \nawake at all times and all switching cycles are aligned to \nthe clock. In this mode much of the internal circuitry is \nawake at all times, increasing quiescent current to several \nhundred µA. Second is that full switching frequency is \nreached at lower output load than in Burst Mode operation \n(see Figure 1b). To enable pulse-skipping mode, the SYNC \npin is tied high either to a logic output or to the INTV CC \npin. When a clock is applied to the SYNC pin the LT8610 \nwill also operate in pulse-skipping mode.\nFigure 1.

The current flowing in the divider acts as a load \ncurrent, and will increase the no-load input current to the \nconverter, which is approximately:\n IQ=1.7µA+VOUT\nR1+R2⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟VOUT\nVIN⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟1\nn⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\n (2)\nwhere 1.7µA is the quiescent current of the LT8610 and \nthe second term is the current in the feedback divider \nreflected to the input of the buck operating at its light \nload efficiency n. For a 3.3V application with R1 = 1M and \nR2 = 412k, the feedback divider draws 2.3µA. With VIN = \n12V and n = 80%, this adds 0.8µA to the 1.7µA quiescent \ncurrent resulting in 2.5µA no-load current from the 12V \nsupply. Note that this equation implies that the no-load \ncurrent is a function of VIN; this is plotted in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics section. \nWhen using large FB resistors, a 4.7pF to 10pF phase-lead \ncapacitor should be connected from V OUT to FB. \nSetting the Switching Frequency\nThe LT8610 uses a constant frequency PWM  architecture \nthat can be programmed to switch from 200kHz to 2.2MHz \nby using a resistor tied from the RT pin to ground. A table \nshowing the necessary RT value for a desired switching \nfrequency is in Table 1.\nThe RT resistor required for a desired switching frequency \ncan be calculated using:\n  RT=46.5\nfSW–5.2\n (3)where RT is in kΩ and fSW is the desired switching fre-\nquency in MHz.\nTable 1.

The \nadvantage of high frequency operation is that smaller induc -\ntor and capacitor values may be used. The disadvantages \nare lower efficiency and a smaller input voltage range. \nThe highest switching frequency (f SW(MAX) ) for a given \napplication can be calculated as follows:\n  fSW(MAX)=VOUT+VSW(BOT)\ntON(MIN)VIN–VSW(TOP)+VSW(BOT) ( ) (4)\nwhere VIN is the typical input voltage, VOUT is the output \nvoltage, VSW(TOP)  and VSW(BOT)  are the internal switch \ndrops (~0.3V, ~0.15V, respectively at maximum load) \nand tON(MIN)  is the minimum top switch on-time (see the \nElectrical Characteristics). This equation shows that a \nslower switching frequency is necessary to accommodate \na high V IN/VOUT ratio. \nFor transient operation, VIN may go as high as the abso-\nlute maximum rating of 42V regardless of the RT value, \nhowever the LT8610 will reduce switching frequency as \nnecessary to maintain control of inductor current to as-\nsure safe operation. \nLT8610\n13\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe LT8610 is capable of a maximum duty cycle of greater \nthan 99%, and the VIN-to-V OUT dropout is limited by the \nRDS(ON)  of the top switch. In this mode the LT8610 skips \nswitch cycles, resulting in a lower switching frequency \nthan programmed by RT .\nFor applications that cannot allow deviation from the pro-\ngrammed switching frequency at low VIN/VOUT ratios use \nthe following formula to set switching frequency: \n VIN(MIN)=VOUT+VSW(BOT)\n1–fSW•tOFF(MIN)–VSW(BOT)+VSW(TOP) (5)\nwhere VIN(MIN)  is the minimum input voltage without \nskipped cycles, VOUT is the output voltage, VSW(TOP)  and \nVSW(BOT)  are the internal switch drops (~0.3V, ~0.15V, \nrespectively at maximum load), fSW is the switching fre-\nquency (set by RT), and tOFF(MIN)  is the minimum switch \noff-time. Note that higher switching frequency will increase  \nthe minimum input voltage below which cycles will be \ndropped to achieve higher duty cycle.\nInductor Selection and Maximum Output Current\nThe LT8610 is designed to minimize solution size by \nallowing the inductor to be chosen based on the output \nload requirements of the application. During overload or \nshort-circuit conditions the LT8610 safely tolerates opera -\ntion with a saturated inductor through the use of a high \nspeed peak-current mode architecture.\nA good first choice for the inductor value is:\n  L=VOUT+VSW(BOT)\nfSW  (6)\nwhere fSW is the switching frequency in MHz, VOUT is \nthe output voltage, VSW(BOT)  is the bottom switch drop \n(~0.15V) and L is the inductor value in μH. \nTo avoid overheating and poor efficiency, an inductor must \nbe chosen with an RMS current rating that is greater than \nthe maximum expected output load of the application. In \naddition, the saturation current (typically labeled ISAT)  \nrating of the inductor must be higher than the load current \nplus 1/2 of in inductor ripple current: \n IL(PEAK)=ILOAD(MAX)+1\n2ΔIL (7)where ∆IL is the inductor ripple current as calculated in \nEquation 9 and ILOAD(MAX)  is the maximum output load \nfor a given application. \nAs a quick example, an application requiring 1A output \nshould use an inductor with an RMS rating of greater than \n1A and an ISAT of greater than 1.3A. During long duration \noverload or short-circuit conditons, the inductor RMS \nrouting requirement is greater to avoid overheating of the \ninductor. To keep the efficiency high, the series resistance \n(DCR) should be less than 0.04Ω, and the core material \nshould be intended for high frequency applications. \nThe LT8610 limits the peak switch current in order to \nprotect the switches and the system from overload faults. \nThe top switch current limit (I LIM) is at least 3.5A at low \nduty cycles and decreases linearly to 2.8A at DC = 0.8. The \ninductor value must then be sufficient to supply the desired  \nmaximum output current (I OUT(MAX) ), which is a function \nof the switch current limit (I LIM) and the ripple current.\n IOUT(MAX)=ILIM–ΔIL\n2 (8)\nThe peak-to-peak ripple current in the inductor can be \ncalculated as follows:\n ΔIL=VOUT\nL•fSW•1–VOUT\nVIN(MAX)⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\n (9)\nwhere fSW is the switching frequency of the LT8610, and \nL is the value of the inductor. Therefore, the maximum \noutput current that the LT8610 will deliver depends on \nthe switch current limit, the inductor value, and the input \nand output voltages. The inductor value may have to be \nincreased if the inductor ripple current does not allow \nsufficient maximum output current (I OUT(MAX) ) given the \nswitching frequency, and maximum input voltage used in \nthe desired application.\nThe optimum inductor for a given application may differ \nfrom the one indicated by this design guide. A larger value \ninductor provides a higher maximum load current and \nreduces the output voltage ripple. For applications requir -\ning smaller load currents, the value of the inductor may \nbe lower and the LT8610 may operate with higher ripple \nLT8610\n14\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\ncurrent. This allows use of a physically smaller inductor, \nor one with a lower DCR resulting in higher efficiency. Be \naware that low inductance may result in discontinuous \nmode operation, which further reduces maximum load \ncurrent.\nFor more information about maximum output current \nand discontinuous operation, see Linear Technology’s \nApplication Note 44. \nFinally, for duty cycles greater than 50% (V OUT/VIN > 0.5), \na minimum inductance is required to avoid sub-harmonic \noscillation. See Application Note 19. \nInput Capacitor\nBypass the input of the LT8610 circuit with a ceramic ca-\npacitor of X7R or X5R type placed as close as possible to \nthe VIN and PGND pins. Y5V types have poor performance \nover temperature and applied voltage, and should not be \nused. A 4.7μF to 10μF ceramic capacitor is adequate to \nbypass  the LT8610  and will easily  handle  the ripple  current . \nNote that larger input capacitance is required when a lower \nswitching frequency is used. If the input power source has \nhigh impedance, or there is significant inductance due to \nlong wires or cables, additional bulk capacitance may be \nnecessary. This can be provided with a low performance \nelectrolytic capacitor.\nStep-down regulators draw current from the input sup-\nply in pulses with very fast rise and fall times. The input \ncapacitor is required to reduce the resulting voltage  \nripple at the LT8610 and to force this very high frequency \nswitching current into a tight local loop, minimizing EMI. \nA 4.7μF capacitor is capable of this task, but only if it is \nplaced close to the LT8610 (see the PCB Layout section). \nA second precaution regarding the ceramic input capacitor  \nconcerns  the maximum  input  voltage  rating  of the LT8610 . \nA ceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable \ninductance forms a high quality (under damped) tank cir-\ncuit. If the LT8610 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the \ninput voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, possibly \nexceeding the LT8610’s voltage rating. This situation is \neasily  avoided  (see Linear  Technology  Application  Note 88).Output Capacitor and Output Ripple\nThe output capacitor has two essential functions. Along \nwith the inductor, it filters the square wave generated \nby the LT8610 to produce the DC output. In this role it \ndetermines the output ripple, thus low impedance at the \nswitching frequency is important. The second function \nis to store energy in order to satisfy transient  loads and \nstabilize the LT8610’s control loop. Ceramic capacitors \nhave very low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and \nprovide the best ripple performance. For good starting \nvalues, see the Typical Applications section.\nUse X5R or X7R types. This choice will provide low output \nripple and good transient response. T ransient performance  \ncan be improved with a higher value output capacitor and \nthe addition of a feedforward capacitor placed between \nVOUT and FB. Increasing the output capacitance will also \ndecrease the output voltage ripple. A lower value of output \ncapacitor can be used to save space and cost but transient \nperformance will suffer and may cause loop instability. See \nthe Typical Applications in this data sheet for suggested \ncapacitor values.\nWhen choosing a capacitor, special attention should be \ngiven to the data sheet to calculate the effective capacitance  \nunder the relevant operating conditions of voltage bias and \ntemperature. A physically larger capacitor or one with a \nhigher voltage rating may be required. \nCeramic Capacitors\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However, ceramic capacitors can cause problems \nwhen used with the LT8610 due to their piezoelectric nature. \nWhen in Burst Mode operation, the LT8610’s switching \nfrequency depends on the load current, and at very light \nloads the LT8610 can excite the ceramic capacitor at audio \nfrequencies, generating audible noise. Since the LT8610 \noperates at a lower current limit during Burst Mode op-\neration, the noise is typically very quiet to a casual ear. If \nthis is unacceptable, use a high performance tantalum or \nelectrolytic capacitor at the output.  Low noise ceramic \ncapacitors are also available.\nLT8610\n15\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nA final precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns \nthe maximum input voltage rating of the LT8610. As  \npreviously mentioned, a ceramic input capacitor combined  \nwith trace or cable inductance forms a high quality (un -\nderdamped) tank circuit. If the LT8610 circuit is plugged \ninto a live supply, the input voltage can ring to twice its \nnominal value, possibly exceeding the LT8610’s rating. \nThis situation is easily avoided (see Linear Technology \nApplication Note 88).\nEnable Pin\nThe LT8610 is in shutdown when the EN pin is low and \nactive when the pin is high. The rising threshold of the EN \ncomparator is 1.0V, with 40mV of hysteresis. The EN pin \ncan be tied to VIN if the shutdown feature is not used, or \ntied to a logic level if shutdown control is required.\nAdding a resistor divider from VIN to EN programs the \nLT8610 to regulate the output only when VIN is above a \ndesired voltage (see the Block Diagram). Typically, this \nthreshold, VIN(EN) , is used in situations where the input \nsupply is current limited, or has a relatively high source \nresistance. A switching regulator draws constant power \nfrom the source, so source current  increases as source \nvoltage drops. This looks like a negative resistance load \nto the source and can cause the source to current limit or \nlatch low under low source voltage conditions. The VIN(EN)  \nthreshold prevents the regulator from operating at source \nvoltages where the problems might occur. This threshold \ncan be adjusted by setting the values R3 and R4 such that \nthey satisfy the following equation:\n VIN(EN)=R3\nR4+1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟•1.0V\n (10)\nwhere the LT8610 will remain off until VIN is above VIN(EN) . \nDue to the comparator ’s hysteresis , switching  will not stop \nuntil the input falls slightly below V IN(EN) .\nWhen operating in Burst Mode operation for light load \ncurrents, the current through the VIN(EN)  resistor network \ncan easily be greater than the supply current consumed \nby the LT8610. Therefore, the VIN(EN)  resistors should be \nlarge to minimize their effect on efficiency at low loads.INTV CC Regulator\nAn internal  low dropout  (LDO) regulator  produces  the 3.4V \nsupply from VIN that powers the drivers and the internal \nbias circuitry. The INTV CC can supply enough current for \nthe LT8610’s circuitry and must be bypassed to ground \nwith a minimum of 1μF  ceramic capacitor. Good bypassing  \nis necessary to supply the high transient currents required \nby the power MOSFET gate drivers. To improve efficiency \nthe internal LDO can also draw current from the BIAS \npin when the BIAS pin is at 3.1V or higher. Typically the \nBIAS pin can be tied to the output of the LT8610, or can \nbe tied to an external supply of 3.3V or above. If BIAS is \nconnected to a supply other than VOUT, be sure to bypass \nwith a local ceramic capacitor. If the BIAS pin is below \n3.0V, the internal LDO will consume current from VIN. \nApplications with high input voltage and high switching \nfrequency where the internal LDO pulls current from VIN \nwill increase die temperature because of the higher power \ndissipation across the LDO. Do not connect an external \nload to the INTV CC pin.\nOutput Voltage T racking and Soft-Start\nThe LT8610 allows the user to program its output voltage \nramp rate by means of the TR/SS pin. An internal 2.2μA \npulls up the TR/SS pin to INTV CC. Putting an external   \ncapacitor on TR/SS enables soft starting the output to pre-\nvent current surge on the input supply. During the soft-start \nramp the output voltage will proportionally track the TR/SS \npin voltage . For output  tracking  applications, TR/SS can \nbe externally driven by another voltage source. From 0V to \n0.97V, the TR/SS voltage will override the internal 0.97V \nreference input to the error amplifier, thus regulating the \nFB pin voltage to that of TR/SS pin. When TR/SS is above \n0.97V , tracking is disabled and the feedback voltage will \nregulate  to the internal  reference  voltage . The TR/SS pin \nmay be left floating if the function is not needed.\nAn active pull-down circuit is connected to the TR/SS pin \nwhich will discharge the external soft-start capacitor in \nthe case of fault conditions and restart the ramp when the \nfaults are cleared. Fault conditions that clear the soft-start \ncapacitor are the EN/UV pin transitioning low, VIN voltage \nfalling too low, or thermal shutdown.\nLT8610\n16\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOutput Power Good\nWhen the LT8610’s output voltage is within the ±9% \nwindow of the regulation point, which is a V FB voltage in \nthe range of 0.883V to 1.057V (typical), the output voltage \nis considered good and the open-drain PG pin goes high \nimpedance and is typically pulled high with an external \nresistor. Otherwise, the internal pull-down device will pull \nthe PG pin low. To prevent glitching both the upper and \nlower thresholds include 1.3% of hysteresis.\nThe PG pin is also actively pulled low during several fault \nconditions: EN/UV pin is below 1V, INTV CC has fallen too \nlow, V IN is too low, or thermal shutdown.\nSynchronization\nTo select low ripple Burst Mode operation, tie the SYNC pin \nbelow 0.4V (this can be ground or a logic low output). To \nsynchronize the LT8610 oscillator to an external frequency  \nconnect a square wave (with 20% to 80% duty cycle) to \nthe SYNC pin. The square wave amplitude should have val-\nleys that are below 0.4V and peaks above 2.4V (up to 6V). \nThe LT8610 will not enter Burst Mode operation at low \noutput loads while synchronized to an external clock, but \ninstead will pulse skip to maintain  regulation. The LT8610 \nmay be synchronized over a 200kHz to 2.2MHz range. The \nRT resistor should be chosen to set the LT8610 switching \nfrequency equal to or below the lowest synchronization \ninput. For example, if the synchronization signal will be \n500kHz and higher, the RT should be selected for 500kHz. \nThe slope compensation is set by the RT value, while the \nminimum slope compensation required to avoid subhar -\nmonic oscillations is established by the inductor size, \ninput voltage, and output voltage. Since the synchroniza -\ntion frequency will not change the slopes of the inductor \ncurrent waveform, if the inductor is large enough to avoid \nsubharmonic oscillations at the frequency set by RT, then \nthe slope compensation will be sufficient for all synchro -\nnization frequencies. \nFor some applications it is desirable for the LT8610 to \noperate in pulse-skipping mode, offering two major differ -\nences from Burst Mode operation. First is the clock stays \nawake at all times and all switching cycles are aligned to \nthe clock. Second is that full switching frequency is reached  \nat lower output load than in Burst Mode operation. These two differences come at the expense of increased quiescent  \ncurrent. To enable  pulse-skipping mode, the SYNC pin is \ntied high either to a logic output or to the INTVCC pin. \nThe LT8610 does not operate in forced continuous mode \nregardless of SYNC signal. Never leave the SYNC pin \nfloating.\nShorted and Reversed Input Protection\nThe LT8610 will tolerate a shorted output. Several features \nare used for protection during output short-circuit and \nbrownout conditions. The first is the switching frequency \nwill be folded back while the output is lower than the set \npoint to maintain inductor current control. Second, the \nbottom switch current is monitored such that if inductor \ncurrent is beyond safe levels switching of the top switch \nwill be delayed until such time as the inductor current \nfalls to safe levels.  \nFrequency foldback behavior depends on the state of the \nSYNC pin: If the SYNC pin is low the switching frequency \nwill slow while the output voltage is lower than the pro-\ngrammed level. If the SYNC pin is connected to a clock \nsource  or tied high, the LT8610  will stay at the programmed  \nfrequency without foldback and only slow switching if the \ninductor current exceeds safe levels.\nThere is another situation to consider in systems where \nthe output will be held high when the input to the LT8610 \nis absent. This may occur in battery charging applications \nor in battery-backup systems where a battery or some \nother supply is diode ORed with the LT8610’s output. If \nthe VIN pin is allowed to float and the EN pin is held high \n(either by a logic signal or because it is tied to VIN), then \nthe LT8610’ s internal circuitry will pull its quiescent current  \nthrough its SW pin. This is acceptable if the system can \ntolerate several μA in this state. If the EN pin is grounded \nthe SW pin current will drop to near 1µA. However, if the \nVIN pin is grounded while the output is held high, regard -\nless of EN, parasitic body diodes inside the LT8610 can \npull current from the output through the SW pin and \nthe VIN pin. Figure 3 shows a connection of the VIN and  \nEN/UV pins that will allow the LT8610 to run only when \nthe input voltage is present and that protects against a \nshorted or reversed input.\nLT8610\n17\nRev.

Figure 4 shows the \nrecommended component placement with trace, ground \nplane and via locations. Note that large, switched currents \nflow in the LT8610’s VIN pins, PGND pins, and the input ca-\npacitor ( C1). The loop formed by the input capacitor should  \nbe as small as possible by placing the capacitor adjacent \nto the VIN and PGND pins. When using a physically large \ninput capacitor the resulting loop may become too large  \nin which case using a small case/ value capacitor placed  \nclose to the VIN and PGND pins plus a larger capacitor  \nfurther away is preferred. These components, along with \nthe inductor and output capacitor, should be placed on the \nsame side of the circuit board, and their connections should  \nbe made on that layer. Place a local, unbroken ground  \nplane under the application circuit on the layer closest to \nthe surface layer. The SW and BOOST nodes should be \nas small as possible. Finally, keep the FB and RT nodes  \nsmall so that the ground traces will shield them from the \nSW and BOOST nodes. The exposed pad on the bottom  of \nthe package must be soldered to ground so that the pad \nis connected to ground electrically and also acts as a heat \nsink thermally. To keep thermal resistance low, extend the \nground plane as much as possible, and add thermal vias \nunder  and near the LT8610 to additional ground planes  \nwithin the circuit board and on the bottom side. \nHigh Temperature Considerations\nFor higher ambient temperatures, care should be taken in \nthe layout of the PCB to ensure good heat sinking of the \nLT8610. The exposed pad on the bottom of the package must be soldered to a ground plane. This ground should \nbe tied to large copper layers below with thermal vias; \nthese layers will spread heat dissipated by the LT8610. \nPlacing additional vias can reduce thermal resistance \nfurther. The maximum load current should be derated \nas the ambient temperature approaches the maximum \njunction rating. Power dissipation within the LT8610 can \nbe estimated by calculating the total power loss from an \nefficiency measurement and subtracting the inductor loss. \nThe die temperature is calculated by multiplying the LT8610  \npower dissipation by the thermal resistance from junction \nto ambient. The LT8610 will stop switching and indicate \na fault condition if safe junction temperature is exceeded. \nLT8610\n18\nRev.
