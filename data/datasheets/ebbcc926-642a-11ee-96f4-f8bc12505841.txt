It contains a low power, high speed, 16-bit sampling ADC with no missing codes (B grade), an internal conversion clock, and a serial, SPI-compatible interface port. The part also contains a low noise, wide bandwidth, short aperture delay, \ntrack-and-hold circuit. On the CS\n falling edge, it samples an analog input, +IN, between 0 V to REF with respect to a ground \nsense, –IN. The reference voltage, REF, is applied externally and \ncan be set up to the supply voltage. Its power scales linearly with \nthroughput. \nThe AD7683 is housed in an 8-lead MSOP or an 8-lead QFN \n(LFCSP) package, with an operating temperature specified from \n−40°C to +85°C. \n \nAD7683 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

B | Page 8 of 16 TERMINOLOGY  \nIntegral Nonlinearity Error (INL)  \nLinearity error refers to the deviation of each individual code \nfrom a line drawn from negative full scale through positive  \nfull scale. The point used as negative full scale occurs ½ LSB before the first code transition. Positive full scale is defined as  \na level 1½ LSB beyond the last code transition. The deviation  \nis measured from the middle of each code to the true straight \nline (see Figure 22). \nDifferential Nonlinearity Error (DNL)  \nIn an ideal ADC, code transitions are 1 LSB ap art. DNL is the \nmaximum deviation from this ideal value. It is often specified in terms of resolution for which no missing codes are guaranteed.  \nOffset Error \nThe first transition should occur at a level ½ LSB above analog ground (38.1 µV for the 0 V to 5 V  range). The offset error is \nthe deviation of the actual transition from that point.  \nGain Error \nThe last transition (from 111...10 to 111...11) should occur for \nan analog voltage 1½ LSB below the nominal full scale (4.999886 V for the 0 V to 5 V range). The gain error is the \ndeviation of the actual level of the last transition from the ideal \nlevel after the offset has been adjusted out.  \nSpurious -Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)  \nThe difference, in decibels (dB), between the rms amplitude of \nthe input signal and t he peak spurious signal.  Signal -to-(Noise + Distortion) Ratio (SINAD)  \nSINAD is the ratio of the rms value of the actual input signal to the rms sum of all other spectral components below the Nyquist frequency, including harmonics but excluding dc. The val ue for \nSINAD is expressed in dB.  \nEffective Number of Bits (ENOB) \nENOB is a measurement of the resolution with a sine wave \ninput. It is related to SINAD (as represented by S/(N+D) ) by  \nthe following formula  and is expressed in bits : \n[]( )02.6/76.1 / −+=dBDNS ENOB  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)  \nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of the first five harmonic components to the rms value of a full -scale input signal and is \nexpressed in dB.  \nSignal -to-Noise Ratio (SNR)  \nSNR is the ratio of the rms value of the actual input sig nal to  \nthe rms sum of all other spectral components below the Nyquist frequency, excluding harmonics and dc. The value for SNR is \nexpressed in dB.  \nAperture Delay  \nAperture delay is a measure of the acquisition performance and is the time between the fallin g edge of the CS\n input and when \nthe input signal is held for a conversion.  \nTransient Response  \nTransient response is t he time required for the ADC to \naccurately acquire its input after a full -scale step func tion i s \napplied.  \n \nData Sheet AD7683\n \nRev.

ADC Simplified Schematic  \nCIRCUIT INFORMATION  \nThe AD7683 is a low power, single -supply, 16 -bit ADC using a \nsuccessive approximation architecture.  \nThe AD7683 is capable of converting 100,000 samples per \nsecond (100 kSPS) and powers down between c onversions. \nWhen operating at 10 kSPS, for example, it consumes typically \n150 µW with a 2.7 V supply, ideal for battery -powered \napplications.  \nThe AD7683 provides the user with an on -chip track -and- hold \nand does not exhibit any pipeline delay or latency, making it \nideal for multiple, multiplexed channel applications. \nThe AD7683 is specified from 2 .7 V to 5.5 V . It is housed in an   \n8-lead MSOP or a tiny, 8 -lead QFN (LFCSP)  package.  \nThe AD7683 is an improved second source to the ADS8320 and \nADS8325. For even better performance, consider the AD7685.  \nCONVERTER OPERATION  \nThe AD7683 is a successive approximation ADC based on a \ncharge redistribution DAC. Figure 21 shows the simplified \nschematic of the ADC. The capacitive DAC consists of two \nidentical arrays of 16 binary -weighted capacitors  that connect  \nto the two comparator inputs.  \nDuring the ac quisition phase, terminals of the array tied to the \ncomparator’s input are connected to GND via SW+ and SW−. All independent switches are connected to the analog inputs. Thus, the capacitor arrays are used as sampling capacitors and acquire the analog sign al on the +IN and −IN inputs. When the \nacquisition phase is complete and the CS\n input goes low, a con -\nversion phase is initiated. When the conversion phase begins, SW+ and SW− are opened first. The two capacitor arrays are \nthen disconnect ed from the inputs and connected to the GND \ninput. Therefore, the differential voltage between the inputs, \n+IN and −IN, captured at the end of the acquisition phase is applied to the comparator inputs, causing the comparator to become unbalanced. By switch ing each element of the capacitor array between GND and REF, the comparator input varies by binary -weighted voltage steps (V\nREF/2, V REF/4...V REF/65,536). \nThe control logic toggles these switches, starting with the MSB, to bring the comparator back into a balanced condition. After \nthe completion of t his process, the part returns to the acquisition  \nphase and the control logic generates the ADC output code.  \nTRANSFER FUNCTIONS  \nThe ideal transfer function for the AD7683 is shown in Figure 22 \nand Table 10.  \n000...000000...001000...010111...101111...110111...111ADC CODE (STRAIGHT BINA RY)\nANALOG INPUT+FS – 1.5 LSB+FS – 1 LSB–FS + 1 LSB –FS\n–FS + 0.5 LSB\n04301-021 \nFigure 22.

Typical Application Diagram \nTYPICAL CONNECTION DIAGRAM \nFigure 23 shows an example of the recommended application \ndiagram for the AD7683. \nANALOG INPUT \nFigure 24 shows an equivalent circuit of the input structure of \nthe AD7683. The two diodes, D1 and D2, provide ESD protec-\ntion for the analog inputs, +IN and −IN. Care must be taken to \nensure that the analog input signal never exceeds the supply rails by more than 0.3 V because this causes these diodes to become forward-biased and start conducting current. However, these \ndiodes can handle a forward-biased current of 130 mA maximum. \nFor instance, these conditions can eventually occur when the input buffer (U1) supplies are different from VDD. In such a case, use an input buffer with a short-circuit current limitation \nto protect the part. \n04301-023CIN RIND1\nD2 CPIN+IN\nOR –IN\nGNDVDD\n \nFigure 24. Equivalent Analog Input Circuit  \nThis analog input structure allows the sampling of the differen-\ntial signal between +IN and −IN. By using this differential input, \nsmall signals common to both inputs are rejected. For instance, by using −IN to sense a remote signal ground, ground potential differences between the sensor and the local ADC ground are eliminated. During the acquisition phase, the impedance of the \nanalog input, +IN, can be modeled as a parallel combination of \nCapacitor C\nPIN and the network formed by the series connection \nof R IN and C IN. C PIN is primarily the pin capacitance. R IN is typically \n600 Ω and is a lumped component consisting of some serial resistors and the on resistance of the switches. C\nIN is typically \n30 pF and is mainly the ADC sampling capacitor. During the conversion phase, when the switches are opened, the input impedance is limited to C\nPIN. R IN and C IN make a 1-pole, low-pass filter that reduces undesirable aliasing effects and limits  \nthe noise. \nWhen the source impedance of the driving circuit is low, the \nAD7683 can be driven directly. Large source impedances signi-ficantly affect the ac performance, especially THD. The dc \nperformances are less sensitive to the input impedance.  \nDRIVER AMPLIFIER CHOICE \nAlthough the AD7683 is easy to drive, the driver amplifier \nneeds to meet the following requirements: \n\uf0b7 The noise generated by the driver amplifier needs to be \nkept as low as possible to preserve the SNR and transition noise performance of the AD7683. Note that the AD7683 \nhas a noise figure much lower than most other 16-bit ADCs and, therefore, can be driven by a noisier op amp while preserving the same or better system performance. The noise coming from the driver is filtered by the AD7683 \nanalog input circuit, 1-pole, low-pass filter made by R\nIN \nand C IN or by the external filter, if one is used. \n\uf0b7 For ac applications, the driver needs to have a THD \nperformance suitable to that of the AD7683. Figure 16 shows \nthe THD vs. frequency that the driver should exceed. \n\uf0b7 For multichannel multiplexed applications, the driver \namplifier and the AD7683 analog input circuit must be \nable to settle for a full-scale step of the capacitor array at a  16-bit level (0.0015%). In the amplifier data sheet, settling at 0.1% to 0.01% is more commonly specified. This could \ndiffer significantly from the settling time at a 16-bit level \nand should be verified prior to driver selection. \nTable 11.

B | Page 14 of 16 VOLTAGE REFERENCE INPUT \nThe AD7683 voltage reference input, REF, has a dynamic input \nimpedance. Therefore, it should be driven by a low impedance \nsource with efficient decoupling between the REF and GND \npins, as explained in the Layout section. \nWhen REF is driven by a very low impedance source (such as \nan unbuffered reference voltage like the low temperature drift \nADR435  reference or a reference buffer using the AD8031 or \nthe AD8605), a 10 μF (X5R, 0805 size) ceramic chip capacitor is \nappropriate for optimum performance. \nIf desired, smaller reference decoupling capacitors with values \nas low as 2.2 μF can be used with a minimal impact on perfor-\nmance, especially DNL. \nPOWER SUPPLY \nThe AD7683 powers down automatically at the end of each \nconversion phase and, therefore, the power scales linearly with \nthe sampling rate, as shown in Figure 25. This makes the part \nideal for low sampling rates (even of a few Hz) and low battery-\npowered applications.  \n1000\n100\n10\n0.11\n0.01\n10 100 1k 10k 100k\n04301-024\nSAMPLING RATE (SPS)OPERATING CURRENT (µA)VDD = 2.7VVDD = 5V\n \nFigure 25. Operating Current vs. Sampling Rate \nDIGITAL INTERFACE \nThe AD7683 is compatible with SPI®, QSPI™, digital hosts, \nMICROWIRE™, and DSPs (for example, Blackfin® ADSP-BF531, \nADSP-BF532 , ADSP-BF533 , or the ADSP-2191M). The connection \ndiagram is shown in Figure 26 and the corresponding timing is \ngiven in Figure 2. \nA falling edge on CS initiates a conversion and the data transfer. \nAfter the fifth DCLOCK falling edge, D OUT is enabled and forced \nlow. The data bits are then clocked, MSB first, by subsequent  DCLOCK falling edges. The data is valid on both DCLOCK \nedges. Although the rising edge can be used to capture the data, a digital host also using the DCLOCK falling edge allows a \nfaster reading rate, provided it has an acceptable hold time.  \n04301-025CS\nDCLOCKDOUT DATA IN\nCLKCONVERT\nDIGITAL HOST\nAD7683\n \nFigure 26. Connection Diagram \nLAYOUT \nDesign the PCB that houses the AD7683 so that the analog and \ndigital sections are separated and confined to certain areas of \nthe board. The pin configuration of the AD7683, with all its \nanalog signals on the left side and all its digital signals on the \nright side, eases this task.  \nAvoid running digital lines under the device because these \ncouple noise onto the die, unless a ground plane under the \nAD7683 is used as a shield. Fast switching signals, such as CS  \nor clocks, should never run near analog signal paths. Avoid \ncrossover of digital and analog signals. \nUse at least one ground plane. It can be common or split between \nthe digital and analog sections. In such a case, it should be joined underneath the AD7683. \nThe AD7683 voltage reference input (REF) has a dynamic input \nimpedance and should be decoupled with minimal parasitic inductances. Accomplish this by placing the reference decoupling ceramic capacitor close to, and ideally right up against, the REF and GND pins and by connecting these pins with wide, low \nimpedance traces. \nFinally, decouple the power supply, VDD, of the AD7683 with a \nceramic capacitor, typically 100 nF, placed close to the AD7683. \nConnect it using short and large traces to provide low impedance \npaths and reduce the effect of glitches on the power supply lines.  \nEVALUATING THE AD7683 PERFORMANCE \nOther recommended layouts for the AD7683 are outlined in the \nevaluation board for the AD7683 ( EV AL-AD7683CBZ ). The \nevaluation board package includes a fully assembled and tested \nevaluation board, documentation, and software for controlling the board from a PC via the EVAL-CONTROL BRD3Z. \n \nData Sheet AD7683 \n \nRev.
