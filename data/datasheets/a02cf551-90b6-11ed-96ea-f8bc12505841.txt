The balanced structure of the signal path minimizes distortion while it also reduces the risk of spurious feedforward at low gains and high frequencies caused \nby parasitic coupling. While operation between a balanced source \nand load is recommended, a single sided input is internally \nconverted to differential form. \nThe input impedance is 50 Ω from INHI to INLO. The outputs \nare usually coupled into a 50 Ω grounded load via a 1:1 balun. A \nsingle supply of 4.75 V to 5.25 V is required. \nThe 50 Ω input system converts the applied voltage to a pair of \ndifferential currents with high linearity and good common rejection even when driven by a single sided source. The signal \ncurrents are then applied to a proprietary voltage controlled \nattenuator providing precise definition of the overall gain under the control of the linear in dB interface. The GAIN pin accepts a voltage from 0 V at minimum gain to 1.4 V at full gain with a \n20 mV/dB scaling factor. The output of the high accuracy wideband attenuator is applied \nto a differential transimpedance output stage. The output stage sets the 50 Ω differential output impedances and drives the OPHI and OPLO pins. The ADL5330 has a power-down function. It can be powered down by a Logic LO input on the \nENBL pin. The current consumption in power-down mode is \n250 μA. \nThe ADL5330 is fabricated on an Analog Devices, Inc., \nproprietary high performance, complementary bipolar IC process. The ADL5330 is available in a 24-lead (4 mm × 4 mm), Pb-free LFCSP package and is specified for operation from ambient temperatures of −40°C to +85°C. An evaluation board is also available. \n \n   \n \nADL5330 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

B | Page 12 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADL5330 is a high performance, voltage controlled variable \ngain amplifier/attenuator for use in applications with frequencies up to 3 GHz. This device serves as an output variable gain amplifier (OVGA) for applications where a reasonably constant \ninput level is available and the output level adjusts over a wide \nrange. One aspect of an OVGA is the output metrics, OIP3 and \nOP1dB, decrease with  decreasing gain. \nThe signal path is fully differential throughout the device in \norder to provide the usual benefits of differential signaling, including reduced radiation, reduced parasitic feedthrough, and reduced susceptibility to common-mode interference with other \ncircuits. Figure 31 provides a simplified schematic of the \nADL5330. \nGAIN\nCONTROL\n05134-031OPHI\nOPLOINHI\nINLOTRANSIMPEDANCE\nAMPLIFIER\nGm STAGE\n \nFigure 31. Simplified Schematic \nA controlled input impedance of 50 Ω is achieved through a \ncombination of passive and active (feedback-derived) termination \ntechniques in an input Gm stage. The input compression point of the Gm stage is 1 dBm to 3 dBm, depending on the input \nfrequency.  \nNote that the inputs of the Gm stage are internally biased to a \ndc level, and dc blocking capacitors are generally needed on the \ninputs to avoid upsetting operation of the device. \nThe currents from the Gm stage are then injected into a balanced \nladder attenuator at a deliberately diffused location along the \nladder, wherein the location of the centroid of the injection region is dependent on the applied gain control voltage. The steering of the current injection into the ladder is accomplished by proprietary means to achieve linear in dB gain control and \nlow distortion. \nLinear in dB gain control is accomplished by the application of \na voltage in the range of 0 V dc to 1.4 V dc to the gain control \npin, with maximum gain occurring at the highest voltage.  \nThe output of the ladder attenuator is passed into a fixed gain \ntransimpedance amplifier (TZA) to provide gain and buffer the ladder terminating impedance from load variations. The TZA \nuses feedback to improve linearity and to provide controlled \n50 Ω differential output impedance. The quiescent current of the output amplifier is adaptive; it is slaved to the gain control voltage to conserve power at times when the gain (and output \npower) are low. \nThe outputs of the ADL5330 require external dc bias to the \npositive supply voltage. This bias is typically supplied through \nexternal inductors. The outputs are best taken differentially to \navoid any common-mode noise that is present, but, if necessary, \ncan be taken single-ended from either output.  \nIf only a single output is used, it is still necessary to provide bias \nto the unused output pin, and it is advisable to arrange a reasonably equivalent ac load on the unused output. Differential output can be taken via a 1:1 balun into a 50 Ω environment. In virtually all cases, it is necessary to use dc blocking in the output signal path. \nAt high gain settings, the noise floor is set by the input stage, in \nwhich case the noise figure (NF) of the device is essentially \nindependent of the gain setting. Below a certain gain setting, however, the input stage noise that reaches the output of the attenuator falls below the input equivalent noise of the output stage. In such a case, the output noise is dominated by the \noutput stage itself; therefore, the overall NF of the device gets \nworse on a dB per dB basis, because the gain is reduced below the critical value. Figure 9 through Figure 13 provide details of \nthis behavior. \n   \n \nData Sheet ADL5330\n \nRev. B | Page 13 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nBASIC CONNECTIONS \nFigure 32 shows the basic connections for operating the ADL5330. \nThere are two positive supplies, VPS1 and VPS2, which must be \nconnected to the same potential. Both COM1 and COM2 (common pins) should be connected to a low impedance ground plane. \nA power supply voltage between 4.75 V and 5.25 V should be \napplied to VPS1 and VPS2. Connect decoupling capacitors with \n100 pF and 0.1 μF power supplies close to each power supply pin. The VPS2 pins (Pin 18 through Pin 22) can share a pair of \ndecoupling capacitors because of their proximity to each other. \nThe outputs of the ADL5330, OPHI and OPLO, are open collectors \nthat need to be pulled up to the positive supply with 120 nH RF chokes. The ac coupling capacitors and the RF chokes are the \nprinciple limitations for operation at low frequencies. For example, \nto operate down to 1 MHz, 0.1 μF ac coupling capacitors and 1.5 μH RF chokes should be used. Note that in some circum-stances, the use of substantially larger inductor values results in \noscillations. Since the differential outputs are biased to the positive supply, \nac-coupling capacitors, preferably 100 pF, are needed between the ADL5330 outputs and the next stage in the system. Similarly, the INHI and INLO input pins are at bias voltages of about 3.3 V above ground. \nThe nominal input and output impedance looking into each \nindividual RF input/output pin is 25 Ω. Consequently, the \ndifferential impedance is 50 Ω. \nTo enable the ADL5330, the ENBL pin must be pulled high. \nTaking ENBL low puts the ADL5330 in sleep mode, reducing current consumption to 250 μA at ambient. The voltage on ENBL must be greater than 1.7 V to enable the device. When enabled, the device draws 100 mA at low gain to 215 mA at maximum gain. \n \nINHIC13\n100pF\nC11\n100pFC12\n0.1\uf06dF\nC10\n1nFC9\n1nFINLO\nCOM1\nVPS1VPS1\nVREF\nCOM2GNLOCOM1OPBSIPBSGAIN\nVPS2VPS2VPS2VPS2ENBL\nCOM1\nC14\n100pFOPHIC5\n100pF\nOPLO\nCOM2\nVPS2VPS2\nCOM2\nC6\n100pF\nC7\n100pF\nC80.1\uf06dFC10.1\uf06dF\nC2\n100pF\nC16\n100pFC12\n0.1\uf06dFVPOSGAIN\nRF INPUT RF OUTPUT\nVPOS\nVPOSVPOS\nC3\n0.1\uf06dF\nC4\n100pFVPOS\nL2\n120nHL1120nH\nADL5330\n05334-032\n \nFigure 32.

B | Page 14 of 24 RF INPUT/OUTPUT INTERFACE \nThe ADL5330 is primarily designed for differential signals; \nhowever, there are several configurations that can be implemented \nto interface the ADL5330 to single-ended applications. Figure 33 to Figure 35 show three options for differential to single-ended \ninterfaces. All three configurations use ac-coupling capacitors at \nthe input/output and RF chokes at the output. \nRFIN100pF\n100pFINHI\nINLORFOUT100pF\n100pFOPHI\nOPLOADL5330\nRF VGA120nH120nH+5V\n05134-033ETC1-1-13 ETC1-1-13\n \nFigure 33.

Single-Ended Dr ive with Balanced Output \nFigure 33 illustrates differential balance at the input and output \nusing a transformer balun. Input and output baluns are recom-mended for optimal performance. Much of the characterization for the ADL5330 was completed using 1:1 baluns at the input and output for single-ended 50 Ω match. Operation using \nM/A-COM ETC1-1-13 transmission line transformer baluns  \nis recommended for a broadband interface; however, narrow-band baluns can be used for applications requiring lower insertion \nloss over smaller bandwidths. \nThe device can be driven single-ended with similar performance, \nas shown in Figure 34. The single-ended input interface can be implemented by driving one of the input terminals and terminating the unused input to ground. To achieve the optimal performance, \nthe output must remain balanced. In the case of Figure 34, a \ntransformer balun is used at the output. \nAs an alternative to transformer baluns, lumped element baluns \ncomprised of passive L and C components can be designed at specific frequencies. Figure 35 illustrates differential balance at the input and output of the ADL5330 using discrete lumped element baluns. The lumped element baluns present 180° of \nphase difference while also providing impedance transformation \nfrom source to load, and vice versa. Table 4 lists recommended passive values for various center frequencies with single-ended impedances of 50 Ω. Agilent’s free AppCAD\nTM program allows \nfor simple calculation of passive components for lumped element baluns. \nThe lumped element baluns offer ±0.5 dB flatness across 50 MHz \nfor 900 MHz and 2200 MHz. At 2.7 GHz, the frequency band is \nlimited by stray capacitances that dominate the passive components in the lumped element balun at these high frequencies. Therefore, PCB parasitics must be considered during lumped element \nbalun design and board layout. \nTable 4.

B | Page 15 of 24 GAIN CONTROL INPUT  \nWhen the VGA is enabled, the voltage applied to the GAIN pin \nsets the gain. The input impedance of the GAIN pin is 1 MΩ.  \nThe gain control voltage range is between 0  V and +1.4 V , which \ncorresponds to a typical ga in range between −38 dB and +22  dB. \nThe useful lower limit of the gain control voltage increases at high frequencies to about 0.5  V and 0.6  V for 2.2  GHz and \n2.7 GHz, respectively. The supply current to the A DL5330 can \nvary from approximately 100 mA at low gain control voltages to \n215 mA at 1.4 V .  \nThe 1 dB input compression point remains constant at 3 dBm \nthrough the majority of the gain control range, as shown in \nFigure 9 through Figure 13. The output compression point \nincreases dB for dB with increasing ga in setting. The noise floor \nis constant up to 1 V where it begins to rise.  \nThe bandwidth on the gain control pin is approximately 3  MHz. \nFigure 14 shows the response time of a pulse on the GAIN pin.  \nAUTOMATIC GAIN CONTR OL \nAlthough the  ADL5330 provides accurate gain control, precise \nregulation of output power can be achieved with an automatic \ngain control (AGC) loop. Figure 36 shows the ADL5330 in an \nAGC loop. The addition of the log amp (AD8318/AD8315) or a TruPwr™ detector (AD8362) allows the AGC to have improved \ntemperature stability over a wide ou tput power control range.  \nTo operate the ADL5330 in an AG C loop, a sample of the output \nRF must be fed back to the detector (typically using a directional \ncoupler and additional attenuation). A setpoint voltage is applied  \nto the VSET input of the detector while VOUT is connected to \nthe GAIN pin of the ADL5330. Based o n the defined linear in  dB \nrelationship of the detector between VOUT and the RF input \nsignal , the detector adjusts the voltage on the GAIN pin (the \nVOUT pin  of the detector  is an error amplifier output) until the \nlevel at the RF input corresponds to the applied setpoint voltage. The GAIN setting settles to a value that results in the correct balance between the input signal level at the detector and the \nsetpoin t voltage.  The error amplifier of the detector use s C\nFLT, a ground  referenced \ncapacitor pin, to integrate the error signal (in the form of a \ncurrent). A capacitor must be connected to C FLT to set the loop \nbandwidth and to ensure loop stability.  \nINLOINHI\nGAINOPLOOPHI\nDIRECTIONAL\nCOUPLER\nATTENUATORVPOS COMM\nADL5330+5V +5V\nCLPFVOUT\nVSET RFINLOG AMP OR\nTRUPWR\nDETECTOR\nDAC\n05134-036RFIN\n \nFigure 36. ADL5330 in AGC Loop  \nThe basic connections for operating the ADL5330 in an AGC \nloop with the AD8318 are shown in Figure 37. The AD8318 is a \n1 MHz to 8  GHz precision demodulating logarithmic amplifier. \nIt offers a large detection range of 60 dB with ±0.5 dB tempera -\nture stability. This configuration is similar to Figure 36. \nThe gain of the ADL5330 is controlled by the output pin of the AD8318. This voltage, VOUT, has a range of 0 V to near VPOS. To avoid overdrive recovery issues, the AD8318 output voltage \ncan be scaled down u sing a resistive divider to interface with the \n0 V to 1.4 V gain control range of ADL5330.  \nA coupler/attenuation of 23 dB is used to match the desired \nmaximum output power from the VGA to the top end of the linear operating range of the AD8318 (at approxim ately −5 dBm \nat 900 MHz).  \n \n \nADL5330 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Note that the power control of the AD8318 has a negative sense.

The performance over temperature is most accurate over the highest power range, where it is generally most critical. Across the top 40 dB range of output power, the linear conformance error is well within ±0.5 dB over temperature. \n05134-038ERROR (dB)\n–44\n3\n210–1–2–3\nSETPOINT VOLTAGE (V)2.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0OUTPUT POWER (dBm)30\n2010\n0\n–10–20–30–40\n–50\n \nFigure 38.

The AD8349 is an RF \nquadrature modulator with an output frequency range of 700 MHz to 2.7 GHz. It offers excellent phase accuracy and amplitude balance, enabling high performance direct RF \nmodulation for communication systems. \nThe output of the AD8349 is designed to drive 50 Ω loads and \neasily interfaces with the ADL5330. The input to the ADL5330 can be driven single-ended, as shown in Figure 42. Similar con-figurations are possible with the AD8345 (250 MHz to 1 GHz) \nand AD8346 (800 MHz to 2.5 GHz) quadrature modulators. \nFigure 41 shows how output power, EVM, ACPR, and noise \nvary with the gain control voltage.

At this point, \nadjacent and alternate channel power ratios become \napproximately equal.  \nAs the outp ut power drops, the noise floor, measured in dBm/Hz \nat 50 MHz carrier offset, initially falls and then levels off. \n \n \n05134-044NOISE – dBm @ 50MHz CARRIER\nOFFSET (1MHz BW)\n–90–50\n–55\n–60\n–65\n–70\n–75\n–80\n–85\nOUTPUT POWER (dBm)10 –40 –35 –30 –25 –20 –15 –10 –5 0 5ADJACENT/ALTERNATE CHANNEL\nPOWER RATIO (dBc)–20\n–30\n–40\n–50\n–60\n–70\n–80\n–90\n–100ACPR +5MHZ OFFSET\nACPR +10MHZ\nOFFSET\nNOISE –50MHz OFFSET\n \nFigure 44.

A cavity -tuned filter \nwith a 4.6 MHz pass band was used to reduce noise from the \nsignal source being applied to the device.  \nFigure 46 shows the spectrum of the output signal under \nnominal conditions. Total P OUT of the three -carrier signal is \nequal to 0.46 dBm and V GAIN = 1.4 V .

At low output power \nlevels, ACPR at 1.98 MHz carrier offset degrades as the noise \nfloor of the ADL5330 becomes the dominant contributor to \nmeasured ACPR. Measured noise at 4 MHz carrier offset begins to inc rease sharply above 0 dBm output power. This increase is \nnot due to noise but results from increased carrier -induced \ndistortion. As output power drops below 0 dBm total, the noise floor drops towards −85 dBm.  \nWith a fixed input power of −23 dBm, the output  power was \nagain swept by exercising the gain control input.

This  paddle is internally connected to the \nchip’s ground. Solder the paddle to the low impedance ground plane on the printed circuit board to ensure specified electrical \nperformance and t o provide thermal relief. It is also recommended \nthat the ground planes o n all layers under the paddle be stitched \ntogether with vias to reduce thermal impedance.  \nADL5330 Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 20 of 24 EVALUATION BOARD \nFigure 49 shows the schematic of the ADL5330 evaluation \nboard. The silkscreen and layout of the component and circuit \nsides are shown in Figure 50 through Figure 53. The board is powered by a single-supply in the 4.75 V to 5.25 V range. The \npower supply is decoupled by 100 pF and 0.1 μF capacitors at \neach power supply pin. Additional decoupling, in the form of a series resistor or inductor at the supply pins, can also be added. Table 5 details the various configuration options of the \nevaluation board. \nThe output pins of the ADL5330 require supply biasing with \n120 nH RF chokes. Both the input and output pins have 50 Ω differential impedances and must be ac-coupled. These pins are \nconverted to single-ended with a pair of baluns (M/A-COM \npart number ETC1-1-13). \nInstead of using balun transformers, lumped-element baluns \ncomprising passive L and C components can be designed. Alternate input and output RF paths with component pads are available on the circuit side of the board. Components M1 through M9 are used for the input interface, and M10 through M18 are used for the output interface. DC blocking capacitors of 100 pF must be installed in C15 and C16 for the input and C17 and C18 for the output. The C5, C6, C11, and C12 \ncapacitors must be removed. An alternate set of SMA \nconnectors, INPUT2 and OUT2, are used for this \nconfiguration. \nThe ADL5330 can be driven single-ended; use the RF input path \non the circuit side of the board. A set of 100 pF dc blocking capacitors must be installed in C15 and C16. C5 and C6 must be removed. Use the INPUT2 SMA to drive one of the differential \ninput pins. The unused pin should be terminated to ground, as \nshown in Figure 34.  \nThe ADL5330 is enabled by applying a logic high voltage to the \nENBL pin by placing a jumper across the SW1 header in the O position. Remove the jumper for disable. This pulls the \nENBL pin to ground through the 10 kΩ resistor.  \n \nData Sheet ADL5330 \n \nRev.
