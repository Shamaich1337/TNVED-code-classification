A ferroelectric randomaccess memory or F-RAM is nonvolatile, which means that data\nis retained after power is remov ed. It provides data retention for\nover 151 years while eliminating the reliability concerns,functional disadvantages, and system design complexities of\nbattery-backed SRAM (BBSRAM).  Fast write timing and high\nwrite endurance make the F-RAM superior to other types ofmemory. \nThe FM22L16 operation is similar to that of other RAM devices\nand therefore, it can be used as a drop-in replacement for a\nstandard SRAM in a system. Re ad and write cycles may be\ntriggered by CE\n or simply by changing the address. The F-RAM\nmemory is nonvolatile due to its unique ferroelectric memory\nprocess. These features make t he FM22L16 ideal for nonvolatile\nmemory applications requiri ng frequent or rapid writes. \nThe FM22L16 includes a low vol tage monitor that blocks access\nto the memory array when VDD d r o p s  b e l o w  VDD m i n .  T h e\nmemory is protected against a n inadvertent access and data\ncorruption under this condition. The device also featuressoftware-controlled write pr otection. The memory array is\ndivided into 8 uniform blocks, each of which can be individuall y\nwrite protected.\nThe device is available in a 400-mil, 44-pin TSOP-II surface\nmount package. Device specifications are guaranteed over theindustrial temperature range –40 °C to +85 °C.\nFor a complete list of re lated documentation, click here.\nLogic Block Diagram\nAddress Latch & Write Protect\nCE\nControl \nLogicWE\nBlock & Row DecoderA\nI/O Latch & Bus Driver\nOEDQ32 K x 16 block 32 K x 16 block\n32 K x 16 block 32 K x 16 block\n32 K x 16 block 32 K x 16 block\n32 K x 16 block 32 K x 16 block. . .\nColumn Decoder. . .\nUB, LB\nZZ17-2\nA1-0\n15-0A17-0\nFM22L16\nDocument Number: 001-86188 Rev. *H Page 2 of 22Contents\nPinout ........................................................ ........................3\nPin Definitions ............................................... ...................3\nDevice Operation .............................................. ................4\nMemory Operation ............. ................................. .........4\nRead Operation ................................................ ...........4\nWrite Operation ............................................... ............4\nPage Mode Operation ........................................... ......4\nPre-charge Operation .......................................... ........4\nSleep Mode .................................................... .............4\nSoftware Write Protect ........................................ ........5\nSoftware Write-Protect Timing ................................. ...7\nSRAM Drop-In Replacement ...................................... .8\nMaximum Ratings ............................................... ..............9\nOperating Range ............................................... ................9\nDC Electrical Characteristics ................................. .........9\nData Retention and Endurance .................................. ...10\nCapacitance ................................................... .................10\nThermal Resistance ............................................ ............10\nAC Test Conditions ............................................ ............10AC Switching Characteristics .................................. ..... 11\nSRAM Read Cycle ............................................... ..... 11\nSRAM Write Cycle .............................................. ....... 12\nPower Cycle and Sleep Mode Timing ........................... 16\nFunctional Truth Table ........................................ ........... 17\nByte Select Truth Table ....................................... ........... 17\nOrdering Information .......................................... ............ 18\nOrdering Code Definitions ..................................... .... 18\nPackage Diagram ............................................... ............. 19\nAcronyms ...................................................... .................. 20\nDocument Conventions .......................................... ....... 20\nUnits of Measure .............................................. ......... 20\nDocument History Page ......................................... ........ 21\nSales, Solutions, and Legal Information ...................... 2 2\nWorldwide Sales and Design S upport ......... .............. 22\nProducts ...................................................... .............. 22\nPSoC® Solutions ............................................... ....... 22\nCypress Developer Community . ................................ 22\nTechnical Support ........... .................................. ........ 22\nFM22L16\nDocument Number: 001-86188 Rev. *H Page 3 of 22Pinout\nFigure 1.  44-pin TSOP II pinout\nVSS\nDQ6DQ5DQ4VDD\nA9DQ3\nA10DQ2DQ1DQ0LB\nA13CEA3\nA2\nA1\nA0\nA17\nA16\nA15\nA14 A11A8UBOEA71\n2\n3\n4\n5\n67\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22 23242526272829303132333435363738394041424344\n44-pin TSOP II\nTop View\n(not to scale)\nWEDQ7A4\nVSS\nVDDDQ15\nDQ14\nDQ13\nDQ12\nDQ11\nDQ10\nDQ9\nDQ8(× 16)\nZZA6A5\nA12\nPin Definitions\nPin Name I/O Type Description\nA17–A0 Input Address inputs : The 18 address lines select one of 262,144 words in the F-RAM  array.

All data written to the part is immediately\nnonvolatile with no delay. The device offers page mode\noperation, which provides high-speed access to addresseswithin a page (row). Access to a different page requires that\neither CE\n transitions LOW or the upper address (A17–A2)\nchanges. See the  Functional Truth Table on page 17  for a\ncomplete description o f read and wr ite modes.\nMemory Operation\nUsers access 262,144 memory locations, each with 16 data bits\nthrough a parallel interface. The F-RAM array is organized aseight blocks, each having 8192 rows. Each row has four column\nlocations, which allow fast access in page mode operation.\nWhen an initial address is latched by the falling edge of CE\n,\nsubsequent column locations may be accessed without the need\nt o  t o g g l e  C E . When CE  is deasserted HIGH, a pre-charge\noperation begins. Writes occur immediately at the end of theaccess with no delay. The WE\n pin must be toggled for each write\noperation. The write data is stored in the nonvolatile memory\narray immediately, which is a feature unique to F-RAM calledNoDelay writes. \nRead Operation\nA read operation begins on the falling edge of CE . The falling\nedge of CE  causes the address to be latched and starts a\nmemory read cycle if WE  is HIGH. Data becomes available on\nthe bus after the access time is met. When the address is latch ed\nand the access completed, a new access to a random location(different row) may begin while CE\n is still LOW. The minimum\ncycle time for random addresses is tRC. Note that unlike SRAMs,\nthe FM22L16’s CE -initiated access time is faster than the\naddress access time.\nThe FM22L16 will drive the data bus when OE  and at least one\nof the byte enables (UB , LB) is asserted LOW. The upper data\nbyte is driven when UB  is LOW, and the lower data byte is driven\nwhen LB  is LOW. If OE  is asserted after the memory access time\nis met, the data bus will be driven with valid data. If OE  i s\nasserted before completing the memory access, the data bus will\nnot be driven until valid data is available. This feature minim izes\nsupply current in the system by eliminating tran sients caused b y\ninvalid data being driven to the bus. When OE  is deasserted\nHIGH, the data bus will re main in a HI-Z state. \nWrite Operation\nIn the FM22L16, writes occur in the same interval as reads. The\nFM22L16 supports both CE  and WE  controlled write cycles. In\nboth cases, the address A17–A2 is latched on the falling edge of\nCE.\nI n  a  C E -controlled write, the WE  signal is asserted before\nbeginning the memory cycle. That is, WE  is LOW when CE  falls.\nIn this case, the device begins the memory cycle as a write. Th e\nFM22L16 will not drive the data bus regardless of the state of OE\nas long as WE  is LOW . Input dat a must be valid when CE  isdeasserted HIGH. In a WE -controlled write,  the memory cycle\nbegins on the falling edge of CE . The WE  signal falls some time\nlater. Therefore, the memory cycle begins as a read. The data\nbus will be driven if OE  is LOW; however, it will be HI-Z when WE\nis asserted LOW. The CE - and WE -controlled write timing cases\nare shown in the Figure 12 on page 14 . \nWrite access to the array begins on the falling edge of WE  after\nthe memory cycle is ini tiated. The wr ite access terminates on t he\nrising edge of WE  or CE , whichever comes first. A valid write\noperation requires the user to meet the access time specificati on\nbefore deasserting WE  or CE . The data setup time indicates the\ninterval during which data cannot change before the end of thewrite access (rising edge of WE\n or CE ). \nUnlike other nonvolatile memory te chnologies, there is no write\ndelay with F-RAM. Because the read and write access times of\nthe underlying memory are the same, the user experiences no\ndelay through the bus. The entire memory operation occurs in asingle bus cycle. Data polling, a  technique used with EEPROMs\nto determine if a write is complete, is unnecessary.\nPage Mode Operation\nThe F-RAM array is organized as  eight blocks, each having 8192\nrows. Each row has four column-address locations. Address\ninputs A1–A0 define the column address to be accessed. An\naccess can start on any column address, and other columnlocations may be accessed without the need to toggle the CE\n pin.\nFor fast access reads, after the first data byte is driven to t he bus,\nthe column address inputs A1–A0 may be changed to a new\nvalue. A new data byte is then driven to the DQ pins no later t han\ntAAP, which is less than half the in itial read acce ss time. For fas t\naccess writes, the first write pulse defines the first write ac cess.\nWhile CE  is LOW, a subsequent write pulse along with a new\ncolumn address provides a page mode write access.\nPre-charge Operation\nThe pre-charge operation is an internal condition in which the\nmemory state is prepared for a new access. Pre-charge is\nuser-initiated by driving the CE  signal HIGH. It must remain\nHIGH for at least the min imum pre-charge time, tPC. \nPre-charge is also activated by changing the upper addresses,\nA17–A2. The current row is first closed before accessing the new\nrow. The device automatically detects an upper order address\nchange, which starts a pre-charge operation. The new address\nis latched and the new read data is valid within the tAA address\naccess time; see Figure 9 on page 13 . A similar sequence occurs\nfor write cycles; see Figure 14 on page 14 . The rate at which\nrandom addresses can be issued is tRC and tWC, respectively.\nSleep Mode\nThe device incorporates a sleep mode of operation, which allowsthe user to achieve the lowest power supply current condition. It\nenters a low-power sleep mode by asserting the ZZ\n pin LOW .\nRead and write operations m ust complete before the ZZ  p i n\ngoing LOW. When ZZ  is LOW, all pins are ignored except the ZZ\npin. When ZZ  is deasserted HIGH, there is some time delay\n(tZZEX) before the user can access the device. \nIf sleep mode is no t used, the ZZ  pin should be tied to VDD.\nFM22L16\nDocument Number: 001-86188 Rev. *H Page 5 of 22Software Write Protect\nThe 256K × 16 address space is divided into eight sectors\n(blocks) of 32K × 16 each. Each sector can be individually\nsoftware write-protected and the settings are nonvolatile. A\nunique address and command sequence invokes the\nwrite-protect mode.\nTo modify write protection, the system host must issue six read\ncommands, three write commands, and a final read command.The specific sequence of read a ddresses must be provided to\naccess the write-protect mode. Following the read address\nsequence, the host must write a  data byte that specifies the\ndesired protection state of each sector. For confirmation, the\nsystem must then write the comp lement of the protection byte\nimmediately after the protection byte. Any error that occursincluding read addresses in the wrong order, issuing a seventh\nread address, or failing to complement the protection value wil l\nleave the write pr otection unchanged. \nThe write-protect state machine monitors all addresses, taking\nno action until this particular  read/write sequence occurs. Dur ing\nthe address sequence, each read will occur as a valid operation\nand data from the corresponding addresses will be driven to thedata bus. Any address that occurs out of sequence will cause th e\nsoftware protection state machine to start over. After the addr ess\nsequence is completed, the next operation must be a write cycle .\nThe lower data byte contains the write-protect settings. This\nvalue will not be written to the memory array, so the address i s a\ndon't-care. Rather i t will be held p ending the next cycle, whic h\nmust be a write of the data comp lement to the protection settin gs.\nIf the complement is correct, the write-protect settings will b e\nadjusted. Otherwise, the proc ess is aborted and the address\nsequence starts over. The data value written after the correct six\naddresses will not be entered into the memory.\nThe protection data byte consists of eight bits, each associate d\nwith the write-protect state of a sector. The data byte must be\ndriven to the lower eight bits of the data bus, DQ\n7–DQ0. Setting\na bit to ‘1’ write-protects th e corresponding se ctor; a ‘0’ ena bles\nwrites for that sector. The following table shows the write-pro tect\nsectors with the corre sponding bit that controls the write-prot ect\nsetting.The write-protect address sequence follows:\n1. Read address 24555h\n2. Read address 3AAAAh3. Read address 02333h\n4. Read address 1CCCCh\n5. Read address 000FFh6. Read address 3EF00h\n7. Write address 3AAAAh\n8. Write address 1CCCCh9. Write address 0FF00h\n10.Read address 00000h\nNote  If CE\n is LOw entering the sequence, then an address of\n00000h must precede 24555h.\nThe address sequence provides a secure way of modifying the\nprotection. The write-protec t sequence has a one in 3 × 1032\nchance of randomly accessing exa ctly the first six addresses.\nThe odds are further reduced by requiring three more write\ncycles, one that requires an exa ct inversion of the data byte.\nFigure 3 on page 6  shows a flow chart of t he entire write-protect\noperation. The write-protect settings are nonvolatile. The fact ory\ndefault: all blocks are unprotected.\nFor example, the following sequence write-protects addresses\nfrom 18000h to 27FFFh (sectors 3 and 4): Figure 2.

CE  may remain LOW indefinitely.\nWhile CE  is LOW, the device automatically detects address\nchanges and a new access begins. T his functionality allows CE\nto be grounded as you might with an SRAM. It also allows page\nmode operation at spe eds up to 40 MHz. \nFigure 6  shows a pull-up resistor on CE , which will keep the pin\nHIGH during power cycles, assuming the MCU / MPU pintristates during the reset condition. The pull-up resistor valu e\nshould be chosen to ensure the CE\n pin tracks VDD to a high\nenough value, so that the current drawn when CE  is LOW is not\nan issue. A 10-k \uf057 resistor draws 330 µA when CE  is LOW and\nVDD = 3.3 V.\nNote that if CE  is tied to ground, the user must be sure WE  is not\nLOW at power-up or power-down events. If CE  and WE  are both\nLOW during power cycles, da ta will be corrupted. Figure 7  shows\na pull-up resistor on WE , which will keep the pin HIGH during\npower cycles, assuming the MCU / MPU pin tristates during the\nreset condition.The pull-up resi stor value should be chosen to\nensure the WE  pin tracks VDD to a high enough value, so that\nthe current drawn when WE  is LOW is not an issue. A 10-k \uf057\nresistor draws 330 µA when WE  is LOW and VDD = 3.3 V.Note  I f  C E  is tied to ground, the user gives up the ability to\nperform the software w rite-protect sequence.\nFor applications that require t he lowest power consumption, the\nCE signal should be active (LOW) only during memory accesses.\nThe FM22L16 draws supply current while CE  is LOW, even if\naddresses and control signals are static. While CE  is HIGH, the\ndevice draws no more than the maximum standby current, ISB. \nCE toggling LOW on every address access is perfectly\nacceptable in FM22L16.\nThe UB  and LB  byte select pins are active for both read and write\ncycles. They may be used to allo w the device to  be wired as a\n512K × 8 memory. The upper and lower data bytes can be tied\ntogether and controlled with the byte selects. Individual byte\nenables or the next higher address line A18 may be available\nfrom the system processor.\nFigure 6.  Use of Pull-up Resistor on CE\nFigure 7.
