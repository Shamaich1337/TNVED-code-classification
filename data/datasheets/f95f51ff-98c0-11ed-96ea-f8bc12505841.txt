E | 32 of 54Linearity Error or Integral Nonlinearity (INL)\nLinearity error is defined as the maximum deviation of the actual\nanalog output from the ideal output, determined by a straight line\ndrawn from zero scale to full scale.\nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL)\nDNL is the measure of the variation in analog value, normalized to\nfull scale, associated with a 1 LSB change in digital input code.\nMonotonicity\nA DAC is monotonic if the output either increases or remains\nconstant as the digital input increases.\nOffset Error\nOffset error is the deviation of the output current from the ideal of\nzero. For IOUTP, the 0 mA output is expected when the inputs are all\n0. For IOUTN, the 0 mA output is expected when all inputs are set to\n1.\nGain Error\nGain error is the difference between the actual and the ideal output\nspan. The actual span is determined by the difference between the\noutput when all inputs are set to 1 and the output when all inputs\nare set to 0.\nOutput Compliance Range\nThe output compliance range is the range of allowable voltage at\nthe output of a current output DAC. Operation beyond the maximum\ncompliance limits can cause either output stage saturation or break-\ndown, resulting in nonlinear performance.\nTemperature Drift\nTemperature drift is specified as the maximum change from the\nambient value (25°C) to the value at either TMIN or TMAX. For\noffset and gain drift, the drift is reported in ppm of full-scale range\nper degree Celsius (ppm FSR/°C). For reference drift, the drift is\nreported in parts per million per degree Celsius (ppm/°C).\nPower Supply Rejection\nPower supply rejection is the maximum change in the full-scale\noutput as the supplies are varied from minimum to maximum\nspecified voltages.Settling Time\nSettling time is the time required for the output to reach and remain\nwithin a specified error band around its final value, measured from\nthe start of the output transition.\nSpurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)\nSFDR is the difference, in decibels (dB), between the peak ampli-\ntude of the output signal and the peak spurious signal between dc\nand the frequency equal to half the input data rate.\nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)\nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of the first six harmonic com-\nponents to the rms value of the measured fundamental. It is\nexpressed as a percentage (%) or in decibels (dB).\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)\nSNR is the ratio of the rms value of the measured output signal\nto the rms sum of all other spectral components below the Nyquist\nfrequency, excluding the first six harmonics and dc. The value for\nSNR is expressed in decibels (dB).\nAdjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR)\nACLR is the ratio in decibels relative to the carrier (dBc) between\nthe measured power within a channel relative to its adjacent chan-\nnel.\nComplex Image Rejection\nIn a traditional two-part upconversion, two images are created\naround the second IF frequency. These images have the effect of\nwasting transmitter power and system bandwidth. By placing the\nreal part of a second complex modulator in series with the first\ncomplex modulator, either the upper or lower frequency image near\nthe second IF can be rejected.\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 33 of 54Figure 84. Simplified Block Diagram\nFigure 84  shows a simplified block diagram of the AD9114/AD9115/\nAD9116/AD9117  that consists of two DACs, digital control logic,\nand a full-scale output current control. Each DAC contains a PMOS\ncurrent source array capable of providing a maximum of 20 mA.\nThe arrays are divided into 31 equal currents that make up the\nfive most significant bits (MSBs). The next four bits, or middle bits,\nconsist of 15 equal current sources whose value is 1/16 of an MSB\ncurrent source. The remaining LSBs are binary weighted fractions\nof the current sources of the middle bits. Implementing the middle\nand lower bits with current sources, instead of an R-2R ladder,\nenhances its dynamic performance for multitone or low amplitude\nsignals and helps maintain the high output impedance of the main\nDACs (that is, >200 M Ω).\nThe current sources are switched to one or the other of the two out-\nput nodes (IOUTP or IOUTN) via PMOS differential current switches.\nThe switches are based on the architecture that was pioneered\nin the AD976x family, with further refinements to reduce distortion\ncontributed by the switching transient. This switch architecture also\nreduces various timing errors and provides matching complementa-\nry drive signals to the inputs of the differential current switches.\nThe analog and digital I/O sections of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/\nAD9117  have separate power supply inputs (AVDD, DVDDIO, and\nCVDD) that can operate independently over a 1.8 V to 3.3 V range.\nThe core digital section (DVDD) requires 1.8 V. For an operating\nsupply voltage of 1.8 V at DVDDIO, DVDD can be strapped to\nDVDDIO. Otherwise, for an operating supply voltage of >1.8 V at\nDVDDIO, the on-chip LDO for the digital block must be enabled and\nDVDD pin must be bypassed with a 0.1 μF capacitor. To ensureproper operation of the device, the RESET/PINMD pin must be\npulsed high after applying power to all supplies. If operating the\ndevice in SPI mode, the minimum duration before setting the pin\nlow is 50 ns. If operating the device in pin mode, there is no need\nto set RESET/PINMD low after pulsing it high and, alternatively, the\npin can be pulled up to DVDDIO.\nThe core is capable of operating at a rate of up to 125 MSPS. It\nconsists of edge-triggered latches and the segment decoding logic\ncircuitry. The analog section includes PMOS current sources, asso-\nciated differential switches, a 1.0 V band gap voltage reference, and\na reference control amplifier.\nEach DAC full-scale output current is regulated by the reference\ncontrol amplifier and can be set from 4 mA to 20 mA via an external\nresistor, xRSET, connected to its full-scale adjust pin (FSADJx).\nThe external resistor, in combination with both the reference control\namplifier and voltage reference, VREFIO, sets the reference current,\nIxREF, which is replicated to the segmented current sources with the\nproper scaling factor. The full-scale current, IxOUTFS , is 32 × IxREF.\nOptional on-chip xRSET resistors are provided that can be program-\nmed between a nominal value of 1.6 k Ω to 8 k Ω (20 mA to 4 mA\nIxOUTFS , respectively).\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  provide the option of setting\nthe output common mode to a value other than AGND via the out-\nput common-mode pin (CMLI and CMLQ). This facilitates directly\ninterfacing the output of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  to\ncomponents that require common-mode levels greater than 0 V.\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nSERIAL PERIPHERAL INTERFACE (SPI)\nanalog.com Rev. E | 34 of 54The serial port of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  is a flex-\nible, synchronous serial communications port that allows easy\ninterfacing to many industry-standard microcontrollers and micro-\nprocessors. The serial I/O is compatible with most synchronous\ntransfer formats, including both the Motorola SPI and Intel® SSR\nprotocols. The interface allows read/write access to all registers that\nconfigure the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117 . Single or multiple\nbyte transfers are supported, as well as MSB first or LSB first\ntransfer formats. The serial interface port of the AD9114/AD9115/\nAD9116/AD9117  is configured as a single I/O pin on the SDIO pin.\nGENERAL OPERATION OF THE SERIAL\nINTERFACE\nThere are two phases to a communication cycle on the AD9114/\nAD9115/AD9116/AD9117 . Phase 1 is the instruction cycle, which is\nthe writing of an instruction byte into the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/\nAD9117 , coinciding with the first eight SCLK rising edges. In Phase\n2, the instruction byte provides the serial port controller of the\nAD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  with information regarding the\ndata transfer cycle. The Phase 1 instruction byte defines whether\nthe upcoming data transfer is a read or write, the number of bytes\nin the data transfer, and the starting register address for the first\nbyte of the data transfer. The first eight SCLK rising edges of each\ncommunication cycle are used to write the instruction byte into the\nAD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117 .\nTo ensure that SPI registers are set to default after power-up, a\nLogic 1 with a minimum pulse width of 50 ns, followed by a Logic\n0, must be applied on Pin 35 (RESET/PINMD). This also resets the\nSPI port timing to the initial state of the instruction cycle. This is true\nregardless of the present state of the internal registers or the other\nsignal levels present at the inputs to the SPI port. If the SPI port is\nin the midst of an instruction cycle or a data transfer cycle, none of\nthe present data is written.\nThe remaining SCLK edges are for Phase 2 of the communication\ncycle. Phase 2 is the actual data transfer between the AD9114/\nAD9115/AD9116/AD9117  and the system controller. Phase 2 of the\ncommunication cycle is a transfer of one, two, three, or four data\nbytes, as determined by the instruction byte. Using a multibyte\ntransfer is the preferred method. Single byte data transfers are\nuseful to reduce CPU overhead when register access requires one\nbyte only. Registers change immediately upon writing to the last bit\nof each transfer byte.\nINSTRUCTION BYTE\nThe instruction byte contains the information shown in Table 11 .\nTable 11.\nMSB LSB\nDB7 DB6 DB5 DB4 DB3 DB2 DB1 DB0\nR/W N1 N0 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0R/W (Bit 7 of the instruction byte) determines whether a read or a\nwrite data transfer occurs after the instruction byte write. Logic 1\nindicates a read operation. Logic 0 indicates a write operation.\nN1 and N0 (Bit 6 and Bit 5 of the instruction byte) determine the\nnumber of bytes to be transferred during the data transfer cycle.\nThe bit decodes are shown in Table 12 .\nTable 12. Byte Transfer Count\nN1 N0 Description\n0 0 Transfer 1 byte\n0 1 Transfer 2 bytes\n1 0 Transfer 3 bytes\n1 1 Transfer 4 bytes\nA4, A3, A2, A1, and A0 (Bit 4, Bit 3, Bit 2, Bit 1, and Bit 0 of\nthe instruction byte) determine which register is accessed during\nthe data transfer portion of the communications cycle. For multibyte\ntransfers, this address is the starting byte address. The following\nregister addresses are generated internally by the AD9114/AD9115/\nAD9116/AD9117  based on the LSBFIRST bit (Register 0x00, Bit 6).\nSERIAL INTERFACE PORT PIN DESCRIPTIONS\nSCLK—Serial Clock\nThe serial clock pin is used to synchronize data to and from\nthe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  and to run the internal state\nmachines. The SCLK maximum frequency is 25 MHz. All data input\nto the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  is registered on the rising\nedge of SCLK. This is shown in Figure 85  and Figure 87  for write\ninstructions where the SCLK rising edges are lined up in the middle\nof the data. All data is driven out of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/\nAD9117  on the falling edge of SCLK. This is shown in Figure 86\nand Figure 88  for read cycles where the SCLK falling edges are\nlined up with the change in data in the data transfer cycle.\nCS—Chip Select\nAn active low input starts and gates a communications cycle. It\nallows more than one device to be used on the same serial commu-\nnications lines. The SDIO/FORMAT pin reaches a high impedance\nstate when this input is high. Chip select should stay low during the\nentire communication cycle.\nSDIO—Serial Data I/O\nThe SDIO pin is used as a bidirectional data line to transmit and\nreceive data.\nMSB/LSB TRANSFERS\nThe serial port of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  can support\nboth most significant bit (MSB) first or least significant bit (LSB) first\ndata formats. This functionality is controlled by the LSBFIRST bit\n(Register 0x00, Bit 6). The default is MSB first (LSBFIRST = 0).\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nSERIAL PERIPHERAL INTERFACE (SPI)\nanalog.com Rev. E | 35 of 54When LSBFIRST = 0 (MSB first), the instruction and data bytes\nmust be written from the most significant bit to the least significant\nbit. Multibyte data transfers in MSB first format start with an instruc-\ntion byte that includes the register address of the most significant\ndata byte. Subsequent data bytes should follow in order from a\nhigh address to a low address. In MSB first mode, the serial port\ninternal byte address generator decrements for each data byte of\nthe multibyte communications cycle.\nWhen LSBFIRST = 1 (LSB first), the instruction and data bytes\nmust be written from the least significant bit to the most significant\nbit. Multibyte data transfers in LSB first format start with an instruc-\ntion byte that includes the register address of the least significant\ndata byte followed by multiple data bytes. The serial port internal\nbyte address generator increments for each byte of the multibyte\ncommunication cycle.\nIf the MSB first mode is active, the serial port controller data\naddress of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  decrements from\nthe data address written toward 0x00 for multibyte I/O operations.\nIf the LSB first mode is active, the serial port controller address\nincrements from the data address written toward 0x1F for multibyte\nI/O operations.\nSERIAL PORT OPERATION\nThe serial port configuration of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/\nAD9117  is controlled by Register 0x00. It is important to note that\nthe configuration changes immediately upon writing to the last bit\nof the register. For multibyte transfers, writing to this register can\noccur during the middle of the communications cycle. Care must be\ntaken to compensate for this new configuration for the remaining\nbytes of the current communications cycle.\nThe same considerations apply to setting the software reset bit\n(Register 0x00, Bit 5). All registers are set to their default values\nexcept Register 0x00, which remains unchanged.\nUse of single-byte transfers or initiating a software reset is rec-\nommended when changing serial port configurations to prevent\nunexpected device behavior.\nFigure 85. Serial Register Interface Timing, MSB First Write\nFigure 86. Serial Register Interface Timing, MSB First ReadFigure 87. Serial Register Interface Timing, LSB First Write\nFigure 88. Serial Register Interface Timing, LSB First Read\nPIN MODE\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  can also be operated with-\nout ever writing to the serial port. With RESET/PINMD (Pin 35) tied\nhigh, the SCLK pin becomes CLKMD to provide for clock mode\ncontrol (see the Retimer  section), the SDIO pin becomes FORMAT\nand selects the input data format, and the CS/PWRDN pin serves\nto power down the device. The pins are not latched at power-up. If\nthe data format is changed, it is required to wait 1 μs after power-up\nto ensure proper function.\nOperation is otherwise exactly as defined by the default register\nvalues in Table 13 ; therefore, external resistors at FSADJI and\nFSADJQ are needed to set the DAC currents, and both DACs\nare active. This is also a convenient quick checkout mode. DAC\ncurrents can be externally adjusted in pin mode by sourcing or\nsinking currents at the FSADJI/AUXI and FSADJQ/AUXQ pins, as\ndesired, with the fixed resistors installed. An op amp output with\nappropriate series resistance is one of many possibilities. This has\nthe same effect as changing the resistor value. Place at least 10\nkΩ resistors in series right at the DAC to guard against accidental\nshort circuits and noise modulation. The REFIO pin can be adjusted\n±25% in a similar manner, if desired.\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nSPI REGISTER MAP\nanalog.com Rev.

Simplified Diagram of AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  Timing\nDIGITAL DATA LATCHING AND RETIMER\nSECTION\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  have two clock inputs,\nDCLKIO and CLKIN. The CLKIN is the analog clock whose jitter\naffects DAC performance, and the DCLKIO is a digital clock from\nan FPGA that needs to have a fixed relationship with the input data\nto ensure that the data is sampled correctly by the flip-flops on the\npads.\nFigure 94  is a simplified diagram of the entire data capture system\nin the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117 . The double data rate input\ndata (DB[n:0], where n is 7 for the AD9114, is 9 for the AD9115,\nis 11 for the AD9116, and 13 for the AD9117) is latched at the pads/\npins either on the rising edge or the falling edge of the DCLKIO-INT\nclock, as determined by IRISING, Bit 4 of SPI Address 0x02. Bit\n5 of SPI Address 0x02, IFIRST, determines which channel data is\nlatched first (that is, I or Q). The captured data is then retimed\nto the internal clock (CLKIN-INT) in the retimer block before being\nsent to the final analog DAC core (D-FF 4), which controls the\ncurrent steering output switches. All delay blocks depicted in Figure\n94 are non-inverting, and any wires without an explicit delay block\ncan be assumed to have no delay.\nOnly one channel is shown in Figure 94  with the data pads\n(DB[n:0], where n is 7 for the AD9114, is 9 for the AD9115, is\n11 for the AD9116, and 13 for the AD9117) serving as double data\nrate pads for both channels.\nThe default PINMD and SPI settings are IE = high (closed) and OE\n= low (open). These settings are enabled when RESET/PINMD (Pin\n35) is held high. In this mode, the user has to supply both DCLKIO\nand CLKIN. In PINMD, it is also recommended that the DCLKIO\nand the CLKIN be in phase for proper functioning of the DAC, which\ncan easily be ensured by tying the pins together on the PCB. If\nthe user can access the SPI, setting Bit 2 of SPI Address 0x02,DCI_EN, to logic low causes the CLKIN to be used as the DCLKIO\nalso.\nSetting Bit 1 or Bit 0 of SPI Address 0x02, DCOSGL or DCODBL, to\nlogic high allows the user to get a DCLKIO output from the CLKIN\ninput for use in the user’s PCB system.\nIt is strongly recommended that DCI_EN = DCOSGL = high, or\nDCI_EN = DCODBL = high not be used, even though the device\nmay appear to function correctly. Similarly, DCOSGL and DCODBL\nshould not be set to logic high simultaneously.\nRetimer\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  have an internal data retimer\ncircuit that compares the CLKIN-INT and DCLKIO-INT clocks and,\ndepending on their phase relationship, selects a retimer clock\n(RETIMER-CLK) to safely transfer data from the DCLKIO used at\nthe chip’s input interface to the CLKIN used to clock the analog\nDAC cores (D-FF 4).\nThe retimer selects one of the three phases shown in Figure 95 .\nThe retimer is controlled by the CLKMODE SPI bits as is shown in\nTable 15 .\nFigure 95. RETIMER-CLK Phases\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nDIGITAL INTERFACE OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 43 of 54Note that, in most cases, more than one retimer phase works\nand, in such cases, the retimer arbitrarily picks one phase that\nworks. The retimer cannot pick the best or safest phase. If the\nuser has a working knowledge of the exact phase relationship be-\ntween DCLKIO and CLKIN (and thus DCLKIO-INT and CLKIN ‑INTbecause the delay is approximately the same for both clocks and\nequal to DELAY1), then the retimer can be forced to this phase\nwith CLKMODEN = 1, as described in Table 15  and the following\nparagraphs.\nTable 15. Timer Register List\nBit Name Description\nCLKMODEQ[1:0] Q datapath retimer clock selected output. Valid after the searching bit goes low.\nSearching High indicates that the internal datapath retimer is searching for the clock relationship (DAC is not usable until it is low again).\nReacquire Changing this bit from 0 to 1 causes the datapath retimer circuit to reacquire the clock relationship.\nCLKMODEN 0: Uses the CLKMODEI/CLKMODEQ values (as computed by the two internal retimers) for I and Q clocking.\n1: Uses the CLKMODE value set in CLKMODEI[1:0] to override the bits for both the I and Q retimers (that is, force the retimer).\nCLKMODEI[1:0] I datapath retimer clock selected output.

E | 44 of 54When RESET is pulsed high and then returns low (the part is in\nSPI mode), the retimer runs and automatically selects a suitable\nclock phase for the RETIMER-CLK within 128 clock cycles. The SPI\nsearching bit, Bit 4 of SPI Address 0x14, returns to low, indicating\nthat the retimer has locked and the part is ready for use. The reac-\nquire bit, Bit 3 of SPI Address 0x14, can be used to reinitiate phase\ndetection in the I and Q retimers at any time. CLKMODEQ[1:0] and\nCLKMODEI[1:0] bits of SPI Address 0x14 provide readback for the\nvalues picked by the internal phase detectors in the retimer (see\nTable 16 ).\nTo force the two retimers (I and Q) to pick a particular phase for\nthe retimer clock (they must both be forced to the same value),\nCLKMODEN, Bit 2 of the SPI Address 0x14, should be set high\nand the required phase value is written into CLKMODEI[1:0]. For\nexample, if the DCLKIO and the CLKIN are in phase to first order,\nthe user could safely force the retimers to pick Phase 2 for the RE-\nTIMER-CLK. This forcing function may be useful for synchronizing\nmultiple devices.\nIn pin mode, it is expected that the user tie CLKIN and DCLKIO\ntogether. The device has a small amount of programmable function-\nality using the now unused SPI pins (SCLK, SDIO, and CS). If\nthe two chip clocks are tied together, the SCLK pin can be tied to\nground, and the chip uses a clock for the retimer that is 180° out\nof phase with the two input clocks (that is, Phase 2, which is the\nsafest and best option). The chip has an additional option in pin\nmode when the redefined SCLK pin is high. Use this mode if using\npin mode, but CLKIN and DCLKIO are not tied together (that is,\nnot in phase). Holding SCLK high causes the internal clock detector\nto use the phase detector output to determine which clock to use\nin the retimer (that is, select a suitable RETIMER ‑CLK phase).\nThe action of taking SCLK high causes the internal phase detector\nto reexamine the two clocks and determine the relative phase.\nWhenever the user wants to reevaluate the relative phase of the\ntwo clocks, the SCLK pin can be taken low and then high again.\nESTIMATING THE OVERALL DAC PIPELINE\nDELAY\nDAC pipeline latency is affected by the phase of the RETIMER-CLK\nthat is selected. If latency is critical to the system and must be\nconstant, the retimer should be forced to a particular phase and not\nbe allowed to automatically select a phase each time.\nConsider the case in which DCLKIO = CLKIN (that is, in phase),\nand the RETIMER-CLK is forced to Phase 2. Assume that IRISING\nis 1 (that is, I data is latched on the rising edge and Q data is\nlatched on the falling edge). Then the latency to the output for the\nI channel is four clock cycles total; one clock cycle from the input\ninterface (D-FF 1, not D-FF0 as it latches data on either edge and\ndoes not cause any delay), two clock cycles from the retimer (D-FF\n2 and D-FF 4, but not D-FF 3 because it is latched on the half\nclock cycle or 180°), and one clock cycle going through the analog\ncore (D-FF 5). The latency to the output for the Q channel from the\ntime the falling edge latches it at the pads in D-FF 0 is 3.5 clockcycles (no delay due to D-FF0, 1 clock cycle due to D-FF 1, ½ clock\ncycle to D-FF 2, 1 clock cycle to D-FF 4, and 1 clock cycle to D-FF\n5). This latency for the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  is case\nspecific and needs to be calculated based on the RETIMER-CLK\nphase that is automatically selected or manually forced.\nREFERENCE OPERATION\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  contain an internal 1.0 V\nband gap reference. The internal reference can be disabled by\nsetting Bit 0 (EXTREF) of the power-down register (Address 0x01)\nthrough the SPI interface. To use the internal reference, decouple\nthe REFIO pin to AVSS with a 0.1 μF capacitor, enable the internal\nreference, and clear Bit 0 of the power-down register (Address\n0x01) through the SPI interface. Note that this is the default config-\nuration. The internal reference voltage is present at REFIO and\nramps up for around 2 ms when the proper power-up conditions in\nthe Power Supply  section are followed. If the voltage at REFIO is\nto be used anywhere else in the circuit, an external buffer amplifier\nwith an input bias current of less than 100 nA must be used to\navoid loading the reference. An example of the use of the internal\nreference is shown in Figure 96 .\nFigure 96. Internal Reference Configuration\nREFIO serves as either an input or an output, depending on\nwhether the internal or an external reference is used. Table 17\nsummarizes the reference operation.\nTable 17. Reference Operation\nReference Mode REFIO Pin Register Setting\nInternal Connect 0.1 µF\ncapacitorRegister 0x01, Bit 0 = 0\n(default)\nExternal Apply external\nreferenceRegister 0x01, Bit 0 = 1 (for\npower saving)\nAn external reference is required in applications needing gain toler-\nances with minimal variation or lower temperature drift. In addition,\na variable external voltage reference can be used to implement a\nmethod for gain control of the DAC output.\nRecommendations When Using an External\nReference\nApply the external reference to the REFIO pin. The internal refer-\nence can be directly overdriven by the external reference, or the\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nDIGITAL INTERFACE OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 45 of 54internal reference can be powered down to save power consump-\ntion.\nThe external 0.1 µF compensation capacitor on REFIO is not\nrequired unless specified by the external voltage reference manu-\nfacturer. The input impedance of REFIO is 10 k Ω when the internal\nreference is powered up and 1 M Ω when it is powered down.\nThe ADR130  precision voltage reference or equivalent is recom-\nmended with the analog supply connected to AVDD, as shown in\nFigure 97 .\nFigure 97. External Reference Configuration\nREFERENCE CONTROL AMPLIFIER\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  contain a control amplifier\nthat regulates the full-scale output current, IxOUTFS . The control\namplifier is configured as a V-I converter, as shown in Figure 96 .\nThe output current, IxREF, is determined by the ratio of the VREFIO\nand an external resistor, xRSET, as stated in Equation 4  (see the\nDAC Transfer Function  section). IxREF is mirrored to the segmented\ncurrent sources with the proper scale factor to set IxOUTFS , as stated\nin Equation 3  (see the DAC Transfer Function  section).\nThe control amplifier allows a 10:1 adjustment span of IxOUTFS  from\n2 mA to 20 mA by setting IxREF between 62.5 µA and 625 µA\n(xRSET between 1.6 k Ω and 16 k Ω). When using a resistor larger\nthan 4 k Ω, split the resistor with 4 k Ω plus the additional resistance\nneeded, for example, 16 k Ω made of a 4 k Ω + 12 k Ω combination,\nand add a 1 µF capacitor from 4 k Ω to ground. The wide adjustment\nspan of IxOUTFS  provides several benefits. The first relates directly\nto the power dissipation of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117 ,\nwhich is proportional to IxOUTFS  (see the DAC Transfer Function\nsection). The second benefit relates to the ability to adjust the\noutput over a 8 dB range with 0.25 dB steps, which is useful for\ncontrolling the transmitted power. The small signal bandwidth of the\nreference control amplifier is approximately 500 kHz. This allows\nthe device to be used for low frequency, small signal multiplying\napplications.\nDAC TRANSFER FUNCTION\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  provides two differential cur-\nrent outputs, IOUTP/IOUTN and QOUTP/ QOUTN. IOUTP and\nQOUTP provide a near full-scale current output, IxOUTFS , when all\nbits are high (that is, DAC CODE = 2N − 1, where N = 8, 10, 12,\nor 14 for the AD9114, AD9115, AD9116, and AD9117, respectively),\nwhile IOUTN and QOUTN, the complementary outputs, provide nocurrent. The current outputs appearing at the positive DAC outputs,\nIOUTP and QOUTP, and at the negative DAC outputs, IOUTN and\nQOUTN, are a function of both the input code and IxOUTFS  and can\nbe expressed as follows:\nIOUTP  = (IDAC CODE /2N) × IIOUTFS (1)\nQOUTP  = (QDAC CODE /2N) × IQOUTFS\nIOUTN  = ((2N − 1) − IDAC CODE )/2N × IIOUTFS (2)\nQOUTN  = ((2N − 1) − QDAC CODE )/2N × IQOUTFS\nwhere: IDAC CODE  and QDAC CODE  = 0 to 2N − 1 (that is, decimal\nrepresentation).\nIIOUTFS  and IQOUTFS  are functions of the reference currents, IIREF\nand IQREF, respectively, which are nominally set by a reference volt-\nage, VREFIO, and external resistors, IRSET and QRSET, respectively.\nIIOUTFS  and IQOUTFS  can be expressed as follows:\nIIOUTFS  = 32 × IIREF (3)\nIQOUTFS  = 32 × IQREF\nwhere:\nIIREF = VREFIO/IRSET (4)\nIQREF = VREFIO/QRSET\nor\nIIOUTFS  = 32 × VREFIO/IRSET (5)\nIQOUTFS  = 32 × VREFIO/QRSET\nA differential pair (IOUTP/IOUTN or QOUTP/QOUTN) typically\ndrives a resistive load directly or via a transformer. If dc coupling\nis required, the differential pair (IOUTP/IOUTN or QOUTP/QOUTN)\nshould be connected to matching resistive loads, xRLOAD, that are\ntied to analog common, AVSS. The single-ended voltage output\nappearing at the positive and negative nodes is\nVIOUTP = IOUTP  × IRLOAD (6)\nVQOUTP  = QOUTP  × QRLOAD\nVIOUTN = IOUTN  × IRLOAD (7)\nVQOUTN  = QOUTN  × QRLOAD\nTo achieve 1 V p-p output at the nominal 20 mA output current,\nIRLOAD = QRLOAD must be set to 50 Ω.\nSubstituting the values of IOUTP, IOUTN, IxREF, and VIDIFF can be\nexpressed as\nVIDIFF = {(2 × IDAC CODE  − (2N − 1))/2N} × (32 × VREFIO/\nIRSET) × IRLOAD(8)\nEquation 8  highlights some of the advantages of operating the\nAD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  differentially. First, the differential\noperation helps cancel common-mode error sources associated\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nDIGITAL INTERFACE OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 46 of 54with IOUTP and IOUTN, such as noise, distortion, and dc offsets.\nSecond, the differential code-dependent current and subsequent\nvoltage, VIDIFF, is twice the value of the single-ended voltage output\n(that is, VIOUTP or VIOUTB), thus providing twice the signal power\nto the load. Note that the gain drift temperature performance for a\nsingle-ended output (VIOUTP and VIOUTN) or differential output of the\nAD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  can be enhanced by selecting\ntemperature tracking resistors for xRLOAD and xRSET because of\ntheir ratiometric relationship, as shown in Equation 8 .\nANALOG OUTPUT\nThe complementary current outputs in each DAC, IOUTP/ IOUTN\nand QOUTP/QOUTN, can be configured for single-ended or dif-\nferential operation. IOUTP/IOUTN and QOUTP/ QOUTN can be\nconverted into complementary single-ended voltage outputs, VIOUTP\nand VIOUTN as well as VQOUTP  and VQOUTN , via a load resistor,\nxRLOAD, as described in the DAC Transfer Function  section by\nEquation 6  through Equation 8 . The differential voltages, VIDIFF\nand VQDIFF, existing between VIOUTP and VIOUTN, and VQOUTP\nand VQOUTN , can also be converted to a single-ended voltage\nvia a transformer or a differential amplifier configuration. The ac\nperformance of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  is optimum\nand is specified using a differential transformer-coupled output in\nwhich the voltage swing at IOUTP and IOUTN is limited to ±0.5\nV. The distortion and noise performance of the AD9114/AD9115/\nAD9116/AD9117  can be enhanced when it is configured for differ-\nential operation. The common-mode error sources of both IOUTP/\nIOUTN and QOUTP/QOUTN can be significantly reduced by the\ncommon-mode rejection of a transformer or differential amplifier.\nThese common-mode error sources include even-order distortion\nproducts and noise.\nThe enhancement in distortion performance becomes more signif-\nicant as the frequency content of the reconstructed waveform\nincreases and/or its amplitude increases. This is due to the first-\norder cancellation of various dynamic common-mode distortion\nmechanisms, digital feedthrough, and noise. Performing a differen-\ntial-to-single-ended conversion via a transformer also provides the\nability to deliver twice the reconstructed signal power to the load\n(assuming no source termination). Because the output currents\nof IOUTP/IOUTN and QOUTP/QOUTN are complementary, they\nbecome additive when processed differentially.\nSELF-CALIBRATION\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  have a self-calibration fea-\nture that improves the DNL of the device. Performing a self-calibra-\ntion on the device improves device performance in low frequency\napplications. The device performance in applications where the an-\nalog output frequencies are above 5 MHz are generally influenced\nmore by dynamic device behavior than by DNL and, in these\ncases, self-calibration is unlikely to produce measurable benefits.\nThe calibration clock frequency is equal to the DAC clock divided\nby the division factor chosen by the DIVSEL value. There is a\nfixed pre-divider of 16 and it is multiplied by the DIVSEL, whichhas a range of divide by 2 -256. Each calibration clock cycle is\nbetween 32 and 2048 DAC input clock cycles, depending on the\nvalue of DIVSEL[2:0] (Register 0x0E, Bits[2:0]). The frequency of\nthe calibration clock should be between 0.5 MHz and 4 MHz for reli-\nable calibrations. Best results are obtained by setting DIVSEL[2:0]\nto produce a calibration clock frequency between these values.\nSeparate self-calibration hardware is included for each DAC. The\nDACs can be self-calibrated individually or simultaneously.\nTo perform a device self-calibration, use the following procedure:\n1.Write 0x00 to Register 0x12. This ensures that the UNCALI and\nUNCALQ bits (Bit 1 and Bit 0) are reset.\n2.Set up a calibration clock between 0.5 MHz and 4 MHz using\nDIVSEL[2:0], and then enable the calibration clock by setting\nthe CALCLK bit (Register 0x0E, Bit 3).\n3.Select the DAC(s) to self-calibrate by setting either Bit 4 (CAL-\nSELI) for the I DAC and/or Bit 5 (CALSELQ) for the Q DAC in\nRegister 0x0E. Note that each DAC contains independent cali-\nbration hardware so that they can be calibrated simultaneously.\n4.Start self-calibration by setting Bit 4 (CALEN) in Register 0x12.\nWait approximately 300 calibration clock cycles.\n5.Check if the self-calibration has completed by reading Bit 6\n(CALSTATI) and Bit 7 (CALSTATQ) in Register 0x0F. Logic 1\nindicates that the calibration has completed.\n6.When the self-calibration has completed, write 0x00 to Register\n0x12.\n7.Disable the calibration clock by clearing Bit 3 (CALCLK) in\nRegister 0x0E.\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  allow reading and writing of\nthe calibration coefficients. There are 32 coefficients in total. The\nread/write feature of the coefficients can be useful for improving\nthe results of the self-calibration routine by averaging the results\nof several self-calibration cycles and loading the averaged results\nback into the device.\nTo read the calibration coefficients, use the following steps:\n1.Select which DAC core to read by setting either Bit 4 (CALSELI)\nfor the I DAC or Bit 5 (CALSELQ) for the Q DAC in Register\n0x0E.

This adds or subtracts up to\n20% from the band gap voltage on Pin 34 (REFIO), and the voltage\non the FSADJx resistors tracks this change. As a result, the DAC\nfull-scale current varies by the same amount. A secondary effect\nto changing the REFIO voltage is that the full-scale voltage in the\nAUXDAC also changes by the same magnitude. The register uses\ntwos complement format, in which 011111 maximizes the voltage on\nthe REFIO node and 100000 minimizes the voltage.\nFigure 98. Typical VREF Voltage vs. Code\nOption 2\nWhile using the internal FSADJx resistors, each main DAC can\nachieve independently controlled coarse gain using the lower six\nbits of Register 0x04 (IRSET[5:0]) and Register 0x07 (QRSET[5:0]).\nUnlike Coarse Gain Option 1, this impacts only the main DAC\nfull-scale output current. The register uses twos complement format\nand allows the output current to be changed in approximately\n0.25 dB steps. For applications requiring gain tolerances with mini-mal variation or lower temperature drift, external temperature track-\ning resistors for FSADJx, xRLOAD and xRSET are recommended.\nFigure 99. Effect of xRSET Code\nOption 3\nEven when the device is in pin mode, full-scale values can be\nadjusted by sourcing or sinking current from the FSADJx pins. Any\nnoise injected here appears as amplitude modulation of the output.\nThus, a portion of the required series resistance (at least 20 k Ω)\nmust be installed right at the pin. A range of ±10% is quite practical\nusing this method.\nOption 4\nAs in Option 3, when the device is in pin mode, both full-scale\nvalues can be adjusted by sourcing or sinking current from the\nREFIO pin. Noise injected here appears as amplitude modulation of\nthe output; therefore, a portion of the required series resistance (at\nleast 10 k Ω) must be installed at the pin. A range of ±25% is quite\npractical when using this method.\nFine Gain\nEach main DAC has independent fine gain control using the lower\nsix bits in Register 0x03 (I DACGAIN[5:0]) and Register 0x06 (Q\nDACGAIN[5:0]). Unlike Coarse Gain Option 1, this impacts only the\nmain DAC full-scale output current. These registers use straight\nbinary format. One application in which straight binary format is\ncritical is for side-band suppression while using a quadrature modu-\nlator. This is described in more detail in the Applications Information\nsection.\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nDIGITAL INTERFACE OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 48 of 54Figure 100. Typical DAC Gain Characteristics\nUSING THE INTERNAL TERMINATION\nRESISTORS\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  have four 62.5 Ω termination\ninternal resistors (two for each DAC output). To use these resistors\nto convert the DAC output current to a voltage, connect each DAC\noutput pin to the adjacent load pin. For example, on the I DAC,\nIOUTP must be shorted to RLIP and IOUTN must be shorted to\nRLIN. In addition, the CMLI or CMLQ pin must be connected to\nground directly or through a resistor. If the output current is at\nthe nominal 20 mA and the CMLI or CMLQ pin is tied directly\nto ground, this produces a dc common-mode bias voltage on the\nDAC output equal to 0.625 V. If the DAC dc bias must be higher\nthan 0.625 V, an external resistor can be connected between the\nCMLI or CMLQ pin and ground. This part also has an internal\ncommon-mode resistor that can be enabled. This is explained in the\nUsing the Internal Common-Mode Resistor  section.\nFigure 101. Simplified Internal Load Options\nUsing the Internal Common-Mode Resistor\nThese devices contain an adjustable internal common-mode resis-\ntor that can be used to increase the dc bias of the DAC outputs.By default, the common-mode resistor is not connected. When\nenabled, it can be adjusted from ~60 Ω to ~260 Ω. Each main DAC\nhas an independent adjustment using the lower six bits in Register\n0x05 (IRCML[5:0]) and Register 0x08 (QRCML[5:0]).\nFigure 102. Typical CML Resistor Value vs. Register Code\nUsing the CMLx Pins for Optimal Performance\nThe CMLx pins also serve to change the DAC bias voltages in the\nparts allowing them to run at higher dc output bias voltages. When\nrunning the bias voltage below 0.9 V and an AVDD of 3.3 V, the\nparts perform optimally when the CMLx pins are tied to ground.\nWhen the dc bias increases above 0.9 V, set the CMLx pins at\n0.5 V for optimal performance. The maximum dc bias on the DAC\noutput should be kept at or below 1.2 V when the supply is 3.3 V.\nWhen the supply is 1.8 V, keep the dc bias close to 0 V and connect\nthe CMLx pins directly to ground.\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 49 of 54OUTPUT CONFIGURATIONS\nThe following sections illustrate some typical output configurations\nfor the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117 . Unless otherwise noted,\nit is assumed that IxOUTFS  is set to a nominal 20 mA. For applica-\ntions requiring the optimum dynamic performance, a differential\noutput configuration is suggested.\nA differential output configuration can consist of either an RF\ntransformer or a differential op amp configuration. The transformer\nconfiguration provides the optimum high frequency performance\nand is recommended for any application that allows ac coupling.\nThe differential op amp configuration is suitable for applications\nrequiring dc coupling, signal gain, and/or a low output impedance.\nA single-ended output is suitable for applications in which low cost\nand low power consumption are primary concerns.\nDIFFERENTIAL COUPLING USING A\nTRANSFORMER\nAn RF transformer can be used to perform a differential-to-single-\nended signal conversion, as shown in Figure 103 . The distortion\nperformance of a transformer typically exceeds that available from\nstandard op amps, particularly at higher frequencies. Transformer\ncoupling provides excellent rejection of common-mode distortion\n(that is, even-order harmonics) over a wide frequency range. It also\nprovides electrical isolation and can deliver voltage gain without\nadding noise. Transformers with different impedance ratios can also\nbe used for impedance matching purposes. The main disadvantag-\nes of transformer coupling are low frequency roll-off, lack of power\ngain, and high output impedance.\nFigure 103. Differential Output Using a Transformer\nThe center tap on the primary side of the transformer must be con-\nnected to a voltage that keeps the voltages on IOUTP and IOUTN\nwithin the output common-mode voltage range of the device. Note\nthat the dc component of the DAC output current is equal to IIOUTFS\nand flows out of both IOUTP and IOUTN. The center tap of the\ntransformer should provide a path for this dc current. In most\napplications, AGND provides the most convenient voltage for the\ntransformer center tap. The complementary voltages appearing at\nIOUTP and IOUTN (that is, VIOUTP and VIOUTN) swing symmetrically\naround AGND and should be maintained with the specified output\ncompliance range of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117 .\nA differential resistor, RDIFF, can be inserted in applications in which\nthe output of the transformer is connected to the load, RLOAD,via a passive reconstruction filter or cable. RDIFF, as reflected by\nthe transformer, is chosen to provide a source termination that\nresults in a low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR). Note that\napproximately half the signal power is dissipated across RDIFF.\nSINGLE-ENDED BUFFERED OUTPUT USING\nAN OP AMP\nFigure 104  shows a buffered single-ended output configuration in\nwhich the ADA4899-1  op amp performs a current to voltage (I-V)\nconversion on the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  output current.\nThe ADA4899-1 maintains IOUTN (or IOUTP) at a virtual ground,\nminimizing the nonlinear output impedance effect on the INL per-\nformance of the DAC as described in the Analog Output  section.\nAlthough this single-ended configuration typically provides optimal\ndc linearity performance, its ac distortion performance at higher\nDAC update rates may be limited by the slew rate capabilities of\nthe op amp. The ADA4899-1 provides a negative unipolar output\nvoltage, and its full-scale output voltage is simply the product of\nRFB (49.9 Ω ) and IOUTFS . Set the full-scale output within the voltage\noutput swing capabilities of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nby scaling IOUTFS  and/or the feedback resistor, RFB. An improve-\nment in ac distortion performance may result with a reduced IOUTFS\nbecause the signal current at the op amp is required to sink less\nsignal current.\nFigure 104. Unipolar Buffered Voltage Output\nDIFFERENTIAL BUFFERED OUTPUT USING AN\nOP AMP\nAn op amp can also be used to perform a differential-to-single-\nended conversion, as shown in Figure 105 . The AD9114/AD9115/\nAD9116/AD9117  are configured with two equal load resistors,\nRLOAD, of 50 Ω. The differential voltage developed across IOUTN\nand IOUTP is converted to a single-ended signal via the differential\nop amp configuration. An optional capacitor can be installed across\nIOUTN and IOUTP, forming a real pole in a low-pass filter. The\naddition of this capacitor also enhances the distortion performance\nof the op amp by preventing the high slewing output of the DAC\nfrom overloading the op amp input.\nThe common-mode rejection of this configuration is typically deter-\nmined by the resistor matching. In this circuit, the differential op\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 50 of 54amp circuit using the ADA4899-1  is configured to provide some\nadditional signal gain. The op amp must operate from a dual\nsupply because its output is approximately ±1 V. A high speed\namplifier capable of preserving the differential performance of the\nAD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  while meeting other system level\nobjectives (such as cost or power) must be selected. The differen-\ntial gain, gain setting resistor values, and full-scale output swing\ncapabilities of the op amp must all be considered when optimizing\nthis circuit.\nFigure 105. Differential Buffered Voltage Output\nAUXILIARY DACS\nThe DACs of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  feature two\nversatile and independent 10-bit auxiliary DACs suitable for dc\noffset correction and similar tasks.\nBecause the AUXDACs are driven through the SPI port, they\nshould never be used in timing-critical applications, such as inside\nanalog feedback loops.\nTo keep the pin count reasonable, these auxiliary DACs each share\na pin with the corresponding FSADJx resistor. They are, therefore,\nusable only when enabled and when that DAC is operated on its in-\nternal full-scale resistors. A simple I-to-V converter is implemented\non-chip with selectable shunt resistors (3.2 k Ω to 16 k Ω) such that if\nREFIO is set to exactly 1 V, REFIO/2 equals 0.5 V and the following\nequation describes the no load output voltage:\nV OU T = 0.5 V − I D AC −1.5\nR S\xa0\xa016 kΩ\nFigure 106  illustrates the function of all the SPI bits controlling\nthese DACs with the exception of the QAUXEN (Register 0x0C)\nand IAUXEN (Register 0x0A) bits and gating to prohibit RS < 3.2\nkΩ.Figure 106. AUXDAC Simplified Circuit Diagram\nThe SPI speed limits the update rate of the auxiliary DACs. The\ndata is inverted such that IAUXDAC  is full scale at 0x000 and zero at\n0x1FF, as shown in Figure 107 .\nFigure 107. AUXDAC Op Amp Output vs. Current, AVDD = 3.3 V No Load,\nAUXDAC 0x1FF to 0x000\nTwo registers are assigned to each DAC with 10 bits for the actual\nDAC current to be generated, a 3-bit offset (and gain) adjustment,\na 2-bit current range adjustment, and an enable/disable bit. Setting\nthe QAUXOFS (Register 0x0C) and IAUXOFS (Register 0x0A) bits\nto all 1s disables the respective op amp and routes the DAC current\ndirectly to the respective FSADJI/AUXI or FSADJQ/AUXQ pins.\nThis is especially useful when the loads to be driven are beyond the\nlimited capability of the on-chip amplifier.\nWhen not enabled (QAUXEN or IAUXEN = 0), the respective DAC\noutput is in open circuit.\nDAC-TO-MODULATOR INTERFACING\nThe auxiliary DACs can be used for local oscillator (LO) cancella-\ntion when the DAC output is followed by a quadrature modulator.\nThis LO feedthrough is caused by the input referred dc offset\nvoltage of the quadrature modulator (and the DAC output offset\nvoltage mismatch) and can degrade system performance. Typical\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 51 of 54DAC-to-quadrature modulator interfaces are shown in Figure 108\nand Figure 109 , with the series resistor value chosen to give an\nappropriate adjustment range. Figure 108  also shows external load\nresistors in use. Often, the input common-mode voltage for the\nmodulator is much higher than the output compliance range of the\nDAC, so that ac coupling or a dc level shift is necessary. If the\nrequired common-mode input voltage on the quadrature modulator\nmatches that of the DAC, the dc blocking capacitors in Figure 108\ncan be removed and the on-chip resistors can be connected.\nFigure 108. Typical Use of Auxiliary DACs\nFigure 109  shows a greatly simplified circuit that takes full advant-\nage of the internal components supplied in the DAC. A low-pass\nor band-pass passive filter is recommended when spurious signals\nfrom the DAC (distortion and DAC images) at the quadrature mod-\nulator inputs can affect the system performance. In the example\nshown in Figure 109 , the filter must be able to pass dc to properly\nbias the modulator. Placing the filter at the location shown in Figure\n108 and Figure 109  allows easy design of the filter, because the\nsource and load impedances can easily be designed close to 50 Ω\nfor a 20 mA full-scale output. When the resistance at the modulator\ninputs is known, an optimum value for the series resistor can be\ncalculated from the modulator input offset voltage ratings.\nFigure 109. Typical Use of Auxiliary DACs When DC Coupling to Quadrature\nModulator ADL537x Family\nCORRECTING FOR NONIDEAL\nPERFORMANCE OF QUADRATURE\nMODULATORS ON THE IF-TO-RF\nCONVERSION\nAnalog quadrature modulators make it very easy to realize single\nsideband radios. These DACs are most often used to make radio\ntransmitters, such as in cell phone towers. However, there are sev-\neral nonideal aspects of quadrature modulator performance. Among\nthese analog degradations are gain mismatch and LO feedthrough.Gain Mismatch\nThe gain in the real and imaginary signal paths of the quadrature\nmodulator may not be matched perfectly. This leads to less than\noptimal image rejection because the cancellation of the negative\nfrequency image is less than perfect.\nLO Feedthrough\nThe quadrature modulator has a finite dc referred offset, as well\nas coupling from its LO port to the signal inputs. These can lead\nto a significant spectral spur at the frequency of the quadrature\nmodulator LO.\nThe AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  have the capability to correct\nfor both of these analog degradations. However, understand that\nthese degradations drift over temperature; therefore, if close to\noptimal single sideband performance is desired, a scheme for\nsensing these degradations over temperature and correcting them\nmay be necessary.\nI/Q CHANNEL GAIN MATCHING\nFine gain matching is achieved by adjusting the values in the DAC\nfine gain adjustment registers. For the I DAC, these values are in\nthe I DAC Gain register (Register 0x03, I DACGAIN[5:0]). For the Q\nDAC, these values are in the Q DAC gain register (Register 0x06,\nQ DACGAIN[5:0]). These are 6-bit values that cover ±2% of full\nscale. To perform gain compensation by starting from the default\nvalues of zero, raise the value of one of these registers a few\nsteps until it can be determined if the amplitude of the unwanted\nimage is increased or decreased. If the unwanted image increases\nin amplitude, remove the step and try the same adjustment on\nthe other DAC control register. Iterate register changes until the\nrejection cannot be improved further. If the fine gain adjustment\nrange is not sufficient to find a null (that is, the register goes full\nscale with no null apparent), adjust the course gain settings of\nthe two DACs accordingly and try again. Variations on this simple\nmethod are possible.\nNote that LO feedthrough compensation is independent of phase\ncompensation. However, gain compensation can affect the LO\ncompensation because the gain compensation may change the\ncommon-mode level of the signal. The dc offset of some modulators\nis common-mode level dependent. Therefore, it is recommended\nthat the gain adjustment be performed prior to LO compensation.\nLO FEEDTHROUGH COMPENSATION\nTo achieve LO feedthrough compensation in a circuit, each output\nof the two AUXDACs must be connected through a 10 k Ω resistor\nto one side of the differential DAC output. See the Auxiliary DACs\nsection for details of how to use AUXDACs. The purpose of these\nconnections is to drive a very small amount of current into the\nnodes at the quadrature modulator inputs, thereby adding a slight\ndc bias to one or the other of the quadrature modulator signal\ninputs.\nData Sheet AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 52 of 54To achieve LO feedthrough compensation, the user should start\nwith the default conditions of the AUXDAC registers and then incre-\nment the magnitude of one or the other AUXDAC output voltages.\nWhile this is being done, the amplitude of the LO feedthrough\nat the quadrature modulator output should be sensed. If the LO\nfeedthrough amplitude increases, try either decreasing the output\nvoltage of the AUXDAC being adjusted or try adjusting the output\nvoltage of the other AUXDAC. It may take practice before an effec-\ntive algorithm is achieved. The AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117\nevaluation board can be used to adjust the LO feedthrough down to\nthe noise floor, although this is not stable over temperature.\nRESULTS OF GAIN AND OFFSET\nCORRECTION\nThe results of gain and offset correction can be seen in Figure 110\nand Figure 111 . Figure 110  shows the output spectrum of the quad-\nrature demodulator before gain and offset correction. Figure 111\nshows the output spectrum after correction. The LO feedthrough\nspur at 450 MHz has been suppressed to the noise level. This\nresult can be achieved by applying the correction, but the correction\nmust be repeated after a large change in temperature.\nNote that gain matching improves the negative frequency image\nrejection, but it is also related to the phase mismatch in the quadra-\nture modulator. It can be improved by adjusting the relative phase\nbetween the two quadrature signals at the digital side or properly\ndesigning the low-pass filter between the DACs and quadrature\nmodulators. Phase mismatch is frequency dependent; therefore,\nroutines must be developed to adjust it if wideband signals are\ndesired.\nFigure 110.

AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/AD9117  and ADL5370  with a Single-Tone\nSignal at 450 MHz, Gain and LO Compensation Optimized\nPOWER SUPPLY\nRequirements\nThe analog and digital I/O sections of the AD9114/AD9115/AD9116/\nAD9117  have separate power supply inputs (AVDD, DVDDIO, and\nCLKVDD) that can operate over the 1.8 V to 3.3 V range. The core\ndigital section (DVDD) requires 1.8 V.\nTo ensure proper operation of the device, the RESET/PINMD pin\nmust be pulsed high after applying power to all supplies. If operat-\ning the device in SPI mode, the minimum duration before setting\nthe pin low is 50 ns. If operating the device in pin mode, there\nis no need to set RESET/PINMD low after pulsing it high and,\nalternatively, the pin can be pulled up to DVDDIO.\nRecommendations\nThe user can employ several different decoupling capacitors to cov-\ner both high and low frequencies. These capacitors must be located\nclose to the point of entry at the PCB level and close to the devices,\nwith minimal trace lengths. Recommended decoupling capacitor\nvalues for each supply pin are one of each of the following: 10 nF,\n0.1 μF, and 10 μF.
