The \ndriver outputs are short circuit current limited and enter \na high-impedance state when the device is not powered.\nLVDS Operation\nThe LVDS interface standard is a signaling method intended for point-to-point communication over a controlled \nimpedance medium as defined by the EIA/TIA-644 LVDS \nstandard. The LVDS standard uses a lower voltage swing than other common communication standards, achieving \nhigher data rates with reduced power consumption while \nreducing EMI emissions and system susceptibility to \nnoise.\nLVDS transmitters such as the MAX9110/MAX9112  \nconvert CMOS/LVTTL signals to low-voltage differential \nsignals at rates in excess of 500Mbps. The MAX9110/MAX9112 current-steering architecture requires a resistive \nload to terminate the signal and complete the transmis-sion loop. Because the device switches the direction of  \ncurrent flow and not voltage levels, the actual output voltage  \nswing is determined by the value of the termination  \nresistor at the input of an LVDS receiver. Logic states are \ndetermined by the direction of current flow through the  \ntermination resistor. With a typical 3.5mA output current, the MAX9110/MAX9112 produce an output voltage of \n350mV when driving a 100Ω load. The steady-state- \nvoltage peak-to-peak swing is twice the differential  \nvoltage, or 700mV (typ).\nApplications Information\nSupply Bypassing\nBypass V CC with high-frequency surface-mount ceramic \n0.1μF and 0.001μF capacitors in parallel, as close to the \ndevice as possible, with the smaller valued capacitor the \nclosest. For additional supply bypassing, place a 10μF tantalum or ceramic capacitor at the point where power \nenters the circuit board.Figure 3.

Use controlled impedance traces \nto match trace impedance to both transmission medium \nimpedance and termination resistor. Eliminate reflections and ensure that noise couples as common mode by \n \nrunning the differential traces close together. Reduce skew by matching the electrical length of the traces. Excessive skew \ncan result in a degradation of magnetic field cancellation.\nMaintain the distance between the differential traces to \navoid discontinuities in impedance. Avoid 90° turns and \nminimize the number of vias to further prevent impedance  \ndiscontinuities.\nCables and Connectors\nTransmission media should have a differential characteristic impedance of about 100Ω. Use cables and connectors \nthat have matched impedance to minimize impedance \ndiscontinuities.\nAvoid the use of unbalanced cables, such as ribbon or \nsimple coaxial cable. Balanced cables, such as twisted \npair, offer superior signal quality and tend to generate \nless EMI due to canceling effects. Balanced cables tend to pick up noise as common mode, which is rejected by \nthe LVDS receiver.\nTermination\nTermination resistors should match the differential  \ncharacteristic impedance of the transmission line. Because the MAX9110/MAX9112 are current-steering \ndevices, an output voltage will not be generated without a termination resistor. Output voltage levels are dependent \nupon the termination resistor value. Resistance values \nmay range between 75Ω and 150Ω.\nMinimize the distance between the termination resistor \nand receiver inputs. Use a single 1% to 2% surface-mount \nresistor across the receiver inputs.Board Layout\nFor LVDS applications, a four-layer PC board that  \nprovides separate power, ground, LVDS signals, and input signals is recommended. Isolate the input and LVDS \nsignals from each other to prevent coupling. Separate the input and LVDS signal planes with the power and ground planes for best results.\nRT = 100Ω0.001µF 0.1µF+3.3V\nDIN_\nMAX9110\nMAX9112MAX9111MAX9113OUT_\nLVDS0.001µF 0.1µF+3.3V\nRECEIVER DRIVER\nMAX9110/MAX9112 Single/Dual LVDS Line Drivers with\nUltra-Low Pulse Skew in SOT23\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 7Typical Operating Circuit\nChip Information\nMAX9110 TRANSISTOR COUNT: 765\nMAX9112 TRANSISTOR COUNT: 765PROCESS: CMOS\nMAX9110/MAX9112 Single/Dual LVDS Line Drivers with\nUltra-Low Pulse Skew in SOT23\nwww.maximintegrated.comMaxim Integrated  │ 8Package Information\nFor the latest package outline information and land patterns (footprints), go to www.maximintegrated.com/packages .
