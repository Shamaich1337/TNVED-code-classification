FEATURES \nSingle-supply operation: 2.7 V to 5.5 V \nLow supply current: 45 μA/amplifier Wide bandwidth: 1 MHz No phase reversal Low input currents: 4 pA Unity gain stable Rail-to-rail input and output Qualified for automotive applications \nAPPLICATIONS \nASIC input or output amplifiers Sensor interfaces Piezoelectric transducer amplifiers Medical instrumentation Mobile communications Audio outputs Portable systems  \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8541/AD8542/AD8544 are single, dual, and quad rail-\nto-rail input and output, single-supply amplifiers featuring very \nlow supply current and 1 MHz bandwidth. All are guaranteed to \noperate from a 2.7 V single supply as well as a 5 V supply. These \nparts provide 1 MHz bandwidth at a low current consumption \nof 45 μA per amplifier.  \nVery low input bias currents enable the AD8541/AD8542/AD8544 \nto be used for integrators, photodiode amplifiers, piezoelectric \nsensors, and other applications with high source impedance. The supply current is only 45 μA per amplifier, ideal for battery operation.  \nRail-to-rail inputs and outputs are useful to designers buffering \nASICs in single-supply systems. The AD8541/AD8542/AD8544 \nare optimized to maintain high gains at lower supply voltages, \nmaking them useful for active filters and gain stages. \nThe AD8541/AD8542/AD8544 are specified over the extended \nindustrial temperature range (–40°C to +125°C). The AD8541 is available in 5-lead SOT-23, 5-lead SC70, and 8-lead SOIC \npackages. The AD8542 is available in 8-lead SOIC, 8-lead MSOP , \nand 8-lead TSSOP surface-mount packages. The AD8544 is \navailable in 14-lead narrow SOIC and 14-lead TSSOP surface-mount packages. All MSOP , SC70, and SOT versions are available in tape and reel only.

G | Page 13 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION \nNOTES ON THE AD854X AMPLIFIERS \nThe AD8541/AD8542/AD8544 amplifiers are improved \nperformance, general-purpose operational amplifiers. \nPerformance has been improved over previous amplifiers in several ways, including lower supply current for 1 MHz gain \nbandwidth, higher output current, and better performance at \nlower voltages.  \nLower Supply Current for 1 MHz Gain Bandwidth \nThe AD854x series typically uses 45 μA of current per amplifier, \nwhich is much less than the 200 μA to 700 μA used in earlier \ngeneration parts with similar performance. This makes the \nAD854x series a good choice for upgrading portable designs  \nfor longer battery life. Alternatively, additional functions and \nperformance can be added at the same current drain. \n  Higher Output Current \nAt 5 V single supply, the short-circuit current is typically 60 μA. \nEven 1 V from the supply rail, the AD854x amplifiers can provide a 30 mA output current, sourcing, or sinking. \nSourcing and sinking are strong at lower voltages, with 15 mA \navailable at 2.7 V and 18 mA at 3.0 V . For even higher output currents, see the AD8531 /AD8532 /AD8534 parts for output \ncurrents to 250 mA. Information on these parts is available from your Analog Devices, Inc. representative, and data sheets \nare available at www.analog.com . \nBetter Performance at Lower Voltages  \nThe AD854x family of parts was designed to provide better ac \nperformance at 3.0 V and 2.7 V than previously available parts. \nTypical gain bandwidth product is close to 1 MHz at 2.7 V . Voltage gain at 2.7 V and 3.0 V is typically 500,000. Phase margin is typically over 60°C, making the part easy to use. \n \n \nAD8541/AD8542/AD8544  \n \nRev. G | Page 14 of 20 APPLICATIONS \nNOTCH FILTER \nThe AD854x have very high open-loop gain (especially with a \nsupply voltage below 4 V), which makes it useful for active filters of \nall types. For example, Figure 36  illustrates the AD8542 in the \nclassic twin-T notch filter design. The twin-T notch is desired \nfor simplicity, low output impedance, and minimal use of op \namps. In fact, this notch filter can be designed with only one op \namp if Q adjustment is not required. Simply remove U2 as illustrated in Figure 37 . However, a major drawback to this \ncircuit topology is ensuring that all the Rs and Cs closely match. The components must closely match or notch frequency offset \nand drift causes the circuit to no longer attenuate at the ideal \nnotch frequency. To achieve desired performance, 1% or better component tolerances or special component screens are usually required. One method to desensitize the circuit-to-component mismatch is to increase R2 with respect to R1, which lowers Q. \nA lower Q increases attenuation over a wider frequency range \nbut reduces attenuation at the peak notch frequency. \n \n1/2 AD8542 5\n 6 7 8 3\n2\n 4 11/2 AD85425.0V\nU1 VOUT\nU2R2\n2.5kΩ\nR197.5kΩ\n2.5V\nREFC\n26.7nFC\n26.7nF2.5VREFR/250kΩR\n100kΩR\n100kΩ\n2C\n53.6µF\nf0 =f0 =1\n2πRC\n1\nR1\nR1 + R24  1 –\n00935-035VINVIN\n \nFigure 36. 60 Hz Twin-T Notch Filter, Q = 10 \n \nC2C\nR/2RR  7 3\n2\n 46AD85415.0V\nCVOUT\n2.5V REFVIN\n00935-036U1\n \nFigure 37. 60 Hz Twin-T Notch Filter, Q = ∞ (Ideal) Figure 38  is an example of the AD8544 in a notch filter circuit. The \nfrequency dependent negative resistance (FDNR) notch filter has \nfewer critical matching requirements than the twin-T notch, where as the Q of the FDNR is directly proportional to a single resistor R1. \nAlthough matching component values is still important, it is also \nmuch easier and/or less expensive to accomplish in the FDNR circuit. For example, the twin-T notch uses three capacitors with two unique values, whereas the FDNR circuit uses only two capacitors, which may be of the same value. U3 is simply a buffer that is added to lower the output impedance of the circuit.  \n 4\n1/4 AD8544\n116\n1/4 AD85441/4 AD8544\n10 8 9\n  2 1 3 1/4 AD8544\n121413 57U3\nU1\nU4U2C2\n1µFC1\n1µFR1\nQ ADJUST\n200Ω\nR\n2.61kΩR\n2.61kΩ\nR\n2.61kΩ\nR\n2.61kΩVOUT\n2.5VREF\n2.5VREF2.5VREF\nNCf =1\n2π  LC1\nL = R2C2\n00935-037VIN\n \nFigure 38.

Figure 39  illustrates ¼ of the AD8544 as a \ncomparator in a standard overload detection application. Unlike \nmany op amps, the AD854x family can double as comparators because this op amp family has a rail-to-rail differential input \nrange, rail-to-rail output, and a great speed vs. power ratio.  \nR2 is used to introduce hysteresis. The AD854x, when used as comparators, have 5 μs propagation delay at 5 V and 5 μs \noverload recovery time. \n1/4 AD8541R1\n1kΩ\nVOUT\n2.5VREFVINR2\n1MΩ\n2.5V DC\n00935-038 \nFigure 39. AD854x Comparator Application—Overload Detector \n   AD8541/AD8542/AD8544\n \nRev. G | Page 15 of 20 PHOTODIODE APPLICATION \nThe AD854x family has very high impedance with an input bias \ncurrent typically around 4 pA. This characteristic allows the \nAD854x op amps to be used in photodiode applications and other applications that require high input impedance. Note that \nthe AD854x has significant voltage offset that can be removed \nby capacitive coupling or software calibration. \nFigure 40  illustrates a photodiode or current measurement \napplication. The feedback resistor is limited to 10 MΩ to avoid \nexcessive output offset. In addition, a resistor is not needed on the noninverting input to cancel bias current offset because the bias current-related output offset is not significant when compared to the voltage offset contribution. For best performance, follow the \nstandard high impedance layout techniques, which include the \nfollowing: \n• Shielding the circuit. \n• Cleaning the circuit board. \n• Putting a trace connected to the noninverting input around \nthe inverting input. \n• Using separate analog and digital power supplies.
