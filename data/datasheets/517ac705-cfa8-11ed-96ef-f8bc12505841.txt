Th e range of devices in the Zynq-7000 family allows desi gners to target \ncost-sensitive as well as high-performanc e applications from a single platform using industry-standard tools. While each \ndevice in the Zynq-7000 family contains the same PS, the PL and I/O resources vary between the devices. As a result, the \nZynq-7000 and Zynq-7000S SoCs are able to serve a wide range of applications including:\n\x81 Automotive driver assistance, driver information, and infotainment\n\x81 Broadcast camera\n\x81 Industrial motor control, industrial networking, and machine vision\n\x81 IP and Smart camera\x81 LTE radio and baseband\n\x81 Medical diagnostics and imaging\n\x81 Multifunction printers\x81 Video and night vision equipment\nThe Zynq-7000 architecture enables implementation of custom logic in the PL and custom software in the PS. It allows for \nthe realization of unique and differentiated system functions. The integration of the PS with the PL allows levels of performance that two-chip solutions (e.g., an ASSP with an FPGA) cannot match due to their limited I/O bandwidth, latency, and power budgets.\nXilinx offers a large number of soft IP fo r the Zynq-7000 fa mily. Stand-alone and Linux device  drivers are available for the \nperipherals in the PS and the PL. The Vivado® Design Suite development environment enables a rapid product development for softwa re, hardware, and syst ems engineers. Adoption of the ARM-bas ed PS also brings a broad range of \nthird-party tools and IP prov iders in combination with X ilinx’s existing PL ecosystem.\nThe inclusion of an application processor enables high-level op erating system support, e.g., Linux. Other standard operating \nsystems used with the Cortex-A9 processor are also available for the Zynq-7000 family.\nThe PS and the PL are on separate power domains, enabling the user of these devices to power down the PL for power \nmanagement if required. The processors in the PS always boot first, allowing a software centric approach for PL configuration. PL configur ation is managed by softwar e running on the CPU, so it boots similar to an ASSP.\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 6Figure 1  illustrates the functional blocks of th e Zynq-7000 architec ture.

The dynamic \nmemory controller supports DDR3, DDR3L,  DDR2, and LPDDR2 memories. The stat ic memory controllers support a NAND \nflash interface, a Quad-SPI flash interface, a parallel data bus, and a parallel NOR flash interface. \nDynamic Memory Interfaces\nThe multi-protocol DDR memory controller can be configured to provide 16-bit or 32-bit-wide accesses to a 1 GB address space using a single rank configuration of 8-bit, 16-bit or 32 -bit DRAM memories. ECC is sup ported in 16-bit bus access \nmode. The PS incorporates both the DDR controller and the associated PHY, including its own set of dedicated I/Os. Speed of up to 1333 Mb/s for DDR3 is supported.\nThe DDR memory controller is multi-ported and enables the pr ocessing system and the programmable logic to have shared \naccess to a common memory. The DDR controller features four AXI slave ports for this purpose:\n\x81 One 64-bit port is dedicated for the ARM CPU(s) via th e L2 cache controller and can be configured for low latency.\n\x81 Two 64-bit ports are dedicated for PL access.\n\x81 One 64-bit AXI port is shared by all other AXI masters via the central interconnect. \nStatic Memory Interfaces\nThe static memory interfaces su pport external static memories:\n\x81 8-bit SRAM data bus supporting up to 64 MB\n\x81 8-bit parallel NOR flash supporting up to 64 MB \n\x81 ONFi 1.0 NAND flash support with 1-bit ECC\n\x81 1-bit SPI, 2-bit SPI, 4-bit SPI (quad-SPI), or two quad-SPI (8-bit) serial NOR flash\nI/O Peripherals (IOP)\nThe IOP unit contains the data communication peripherals.

Although 54 pins are not enough for simu ltaneous use of all the I/O peripherals, most IOP interface \nsignals are available to the PL, allowing use of standard PL I/O pins when powered up and properly configured. All MIO pins support 1.8V HSTL and LVCMOS standards as well as 2.5V/3.3V standards. \nInterconnect\nThe APU, memory interface unit, and the IOP are all connected to each other and to the PL through a multilayered ARM AMBA AXI interconnect.The interconnect is non-blocking and supp orts multiple simultaneous master-slave transactions.\nThe interconnect is designed with latency sensitive masters, such as the ARM CPU, having the shortest paths to memory, \nand bandwidth critical masters, such as the potential PL ma sters, having high throughput connections to the slaves with \nwhich they need to communicate. \nTraffic through the interconnect can be regulated through the Quality of Service (QoS) block in the interconnect. The QoS \nfeature is used to regulate traffic generated by the CPU, DMA controller, and a combined entity representing the masters in the IOP.\nPS Interfaces\nPS External Interfaces\nThe PS external interfaces use dedicated pins t hat cannot be assigned as PL pins. These include:\n\x81 Clock, reset, boot mode, and voltage reference\n\x81 Up to 54 dedicated multiuse I/O (MIO) pins, software-configurable to connect to any of the internal I/O peripherals and \nstatic memory controllers\n\x81 32-bit or 16-bit DDR2/DDR3/DDR3L/LPDDR2 memories\nMIO Overview\nThe function of the MIO is to multiplex access from the PS peripheral and static memory interfaces to the PS pins as defined \nin the configuration registers. There are up to 54 pins availabl e for use by the IOP and static memory interfaces in the PS. \nTable 4  shows where the different peripherals pins can be mapped. A block diagram of the MIO module is shown in Figure 2 .\nIf additional I/O pins beyond the 54 are required, it is possibl e to route these through the PL to the I/O associated with the \nPL. This feature is referred to as extendable multiplexed I/O (EMIO). \nPort mappings can appear in multiple locations. For example, there are up to 12 possible port mappings for CAN pins. The \nPS Configuration Wizard (PCW) tool should be used  for peripheral and static memory pin mapping.\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 10Table  4: MIO Peripheral Interface Mapping\nPeripheral Interface MIO EMIO\nQuad-SPI\nNOR/SRAMNANDYes No\nUSB 0,1 Yes — External PHY No\nSDIO 0,1 Yes YesSPI: 0,1\nI2C: 0,1CAN: 0,1GPIOYes\nCAN: External PHYGPIO: Up to 54 bitsYes\nCAN: External PHY\nGPIO: Up to 64 bits\nGigE: 0,1 RGMII v2.0\nExternal PHYSupports GMII, RGMII v2.0 (HSTL), RG MII v1.3, MII, SGMII, and 1000BASE-X in \nProgrammable Logic \nUART: 0,1 Simple UART: \nOnly two pins (Tx and Rx) Full UART (Tx, Rx, DTR, DCD, DSR, RI, RTS and CTS) either require:\nTwo Processing System pins (Rx and Tx) through MIO and six additional Programmable \nLogic pins, or Eight Programmable Logic pins \nDebug Trace Ports Yes — Up to 16 tr ace bits Yes — Up to 32 trace bits \nProcessor JTAG Yes Yes\nNotes: \n1.

The high performance AXI ports are used for high throughput data transfer between the PS and the PL. Coherency, if required, is managed under software control.  When hardware coherent acce ss to the CPU memory is \nrequired, the ACP port is to be used.\nHigh-Performance AXI Ports \nThe high-performance AXI ports provide access from the PL to DDR and OCM in the PS. The four dedicated AXI memory \nports from the PL to the PS are configurable as either 32-bit or 64-bit interfaces. As shown in Figure 3 , these interfaces \nconnect the PL to the memory interconnect via a FIFO controller. Two of the three output ports go to the DDR memory controller and the third goes to the dual-ported on-chip memory (OCM).\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 13Each high-performance AXI port has these characteristics: \n\x81 Reduced latency between PL and processing system memory \n\x81 1 KB deep FIFO\n\x81 Configurable either as 32- or 64-bit AXI interfaces\x81 Supports up to a 32 word buffer for read acceptance \x81 Supports data release control for write accesses to use AXI interconnect bandwidth more efficiently\n\x81 Supports multiple AXI comm ands issuing to DDR and OCM\nAccelerator Cohere ncy Port (ACP)\nThe accelerator coherency port (ACP) is a 64-bit AXI slave interface that provides connectivity between the APU and a \npotential accelerator function in the PL. The ACP directly connects the PL to the snoop control unit (SCU) of the ARM Cortex-A9 processors, enabling cache-cohe rent access to CPU data in the L1 and L2 caches. The ACP provides a low \nlatency path between the PS and a PL-based accelerator when compared with a legacy cache flushing and loading scheme. \nProgrammable Logic (PL) Description\nKey PL features include:\n\x81C L B\n\x81 Eight LUTs per CLB for random logic implementation or distributed memory\n\x81 Memory LUTs are configurable as 64x1 or 32x2 bit RAM or shift register (SRL) \x81 16 flip-flops per CLB\n\x81 2 x 4-bit cascadeable adders for arithmetic functions \n\x81 36 Kb block RAM \n\x81 True dual-port \n\x81 Up to 36 bits wide \n\x81 Configurable as dual 18 Kb block RAMs X-Ref Target - Figure 3\nFigure 3: PL Interface to PS Memory SubsystemTo DDR\nController\nfrom Progr ammable Logic256K\nSRAM From CPU System\nFrom Centr al\nInterconnectProgr ammable\nLogic to Memory\nInterconnect \nFIFO FIFO FIFO FIFOOCM\nInterconnect\nLegend\nArrow direction shows control (m aster to slave)\ndata flows in both direction s.\nAXI 32bit/64bit, AXI 64 bit\nDS190_0 3_031912High-Perform ance AXI Port s\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 14\x81 DSP slices \n\x81 18 x 25 signed multiply\x81 48-bit adder/accumulator \n\x81 Programmable I/O Blocks \n\x81 Support for common I/O standards including LVCMOS, LVDS, and SSTL\x81 1.2V to 3.3V I/O\n\x81 Built-in programmable I/O delay\n\x81 Low-power serial transcei vers in selected devices\n\x81 An integrated Endpoint/Root port (can be Root Complex when connected to the PS) block for PCI Express in selected \ndevices\n\x81 Two 12-bit analog to digital converters (XADC)\n\x81 On-chip voltage and temperature\x81 Up to 17 external differential input channels\n\x81 PL configuration module\nCLBs, Slices, and LUTs\nSome key features of the CLB architecture include: \n\x81 True 6-input LUTs\n\x81 Memory capability within the LUT\n\x81 Register and shift register functionality\nLUTs can be configured as either one 6-input LUT (64-bit ROMs) with one output, or as two 5-input LUTs (32-bit ROMs) with \nseparate outputs but common addresses or logic inputs. Each LUT output can optionally be registered in a flip-flop. Four such LUTs and their eight flip-flops as we ll as multiplexers and arithm etic carry logic form a slice, and two slices form a \nconfigurable logic block (CLB). Four of the eight flip-flops per slice (one flip-flop per LUT) can optionally be configured as \nlatches.\nBetween 25–50% of all slices can also use their LUTs as distribu ted 64-bit RAM or as 32-bit shift registers (SRL32) or as two \nSRL16s. Modern synthesis tools take advantage of these hi ghly efficient logic, arithmetic, and memory features.\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 15Clock Management\nSome of the key highlights of the clock management architecture include:\n\x81 High-speed buffers and routing for low-skew clock distribution\n\x81 Frequency synthesis and phase shifting\n\x81 Low-jitter clock generation and jitter filtering\nEach device in the Zynq-7000 family has up to 8 clock manag ement tiles (CMTs), each consisting of one mixed-mode clock \nmanager (MMCM) and one phase-locked loop (PLL). See Table 5 . \nMixed-Mode Clock Manager and Phase-Locked Loop\nThe MMCM and PLL share many characteristics. Both can serve as a frequency synthesizer for a wide range of frequencies \nand as a jitter filter for incoming clocks.  At the center of both co mponents is a volt age-controlled oscilla tor (VCO), which \nspeeds up and slows down depending on the input voltage it receives from the phase frequency detector (PFD). \nThere are three sets of programmable frequency dividers: D, M, and O. The pre-divider D (programmable by configuration \nand afterwards via DRP) reduces the input frequency and feeds one input of the traditional PLL phase/frequency comparator. The feedback divider M (programmable by configuration and afterwards via DRP) acts as a multiplier because it divides the VCO output frequency before feeding the other input of the phase comparator. D and M must be chosen appropriately to keep the VCO within its specified frequen cy range. The VCO has eight e qually-spaced output phases \n(0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°). Each can be selected to drive one of the output dividers (six for the PLL, O0  \nto O5, and seven for the MMCM, O0 to O6), each programmable by configuration to divide by any integer from 1 to 128.\nThe MMCM and PLL have three input-jitter filter options: Low-bandwidth mode, which has the best jitter attenuation; \nhigh-bandwidth mode, which has the best phase offset; and optimized mode, which allows the tools to find the best setting. \nMMCM Additional Programmable Features\nThe MMCM can have a fractional counter in either the feedback path (acting as a multiplier) or in one output path. Fractional counters allow non-integer increments of \n1/8 and can thus increase frequency synt hesis capabilities by a factor of 8.\nThe MMCM can also provide fixed or dynamic phase shift in small increments that depend on the VCO frequency. At \n1,600 MHz, the phase-shift timing increment is 11.2 ps.\nClock Distribution\nEach device in the Zynq-7000 family provides six different types of clock lines (BUFG, BUFR, BUFIO, BUFH, BUFMR, and \nthe high-performance clock) to address the different clocking requirements of high fanout, short propagation delay, and extremely low skew.Table  5: MMCM Count per Device\nZynq Device MMCM PLL\nXC7Z007S 2 2\nXC7Z012S 3 3\nXC7Z014S 4 4\nXC7Z010 2 2\nXC7Z015 3 3\nXC7Z020 4 4XC7Z030 5 5\nXC7Z035 8 8\nXC7Z045 8 8XC7Z100 8 8\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 16Global Clock Lines\nIn each device, 32 global clock lines have the highest fanout an d can reach every flip-flop clock, clock enable, and set/reset \nas well as many logic inputs. There are 12 global clock lines wit hin any clock region driven by the horizontal clock buffers \n(BUFH). Each BUFH can be independently enabled/disabled, allo wing for clocks to be turned off within a region, thereby \noffering fine-grain control over which clock regions consume po wer. Global clock lines can be driven by global clock buffers, \nwhich can also perform glitchless clock multiplexing and clock enable functions. Gl obal clocks are often driven from the CMT, \nwhich can completely eliminate the basic clock distribution delay.\nRegional Clocks\nRegional clocks can drive all clock destinations in their region. A region is defined as any area that is 50 I/O and 50 CLB hig h \nand half the device  wide. Each device in the Zynq-7000 family has be tween four and fourteen regions. There are four \nregional clock tracks in every re gion. Each regional clock buffer can be driven from either of four clock-capable input pins, \nand its frequency can optionally be divided by any integer from 1 to 8.\nI/O Clocks\nI/O clocks are especially fast and serve only I/O logic and se rializer/deserializer (SerDes) circuits, as described in the \nI/O Logic  section. The SoCs have a direct connection from the MMC M to the I/O for low-jitter, high-performance interfaces.\nBlock RAM\nSome of the key features of the block RAM include:\n\x81 Dual-port 36 Kb block RAM with port widths of up to 72\n\x81 Programmable FIFO logic\n\x81 Built-in optional error correction circuitry\nEach device in the Zynq-7000 family has up to  755 dual-port block RAMs, each storing 36 Kb. Each block RAM has two \ncompletely independent ports that share nothing but the stored data.\nSynchronous Operation\nEach memory access, read or write, is controlled by the clock. All inputs, data, address, clock enables, and write enables are registered. The input address is always clocked, retaining data until the next operation. An optional output data pipeline register allows higher clock rates at  the cost of an extra cycle of latency.\nDuring a write operation, the data output can reflect either the previously stored data, the newl y written data, or can remain \nunchanged.\nProgrammable Data Width\nEach port can be configured as 32K × 1, 16K × 2, 8K × 4, 4K × 9 (or 8), 2K × 18 (or 16), 1K × 36 (or 32), or 512 × 72 (or 64). The two ports can have different aspect ratios without any constraints.\nEach block RAM can be divided into two completely independe nt 18 Kb block RAMs that can each be configured to any \naspect ratio from 16K × 1 to 512 × 36. Everything described previously for the full 36 Kb block RAM also applies to each of the smaller 18 Kb block RAMs.\nOnly in simple dual-port (SDP) mode can data widths of  greater than 18 bits (18 Kb RAM) or 36 bits (36 Kb RAM) be \naccessed. In this mode, one port is dedicated to read operation, the other to write operation. In SDP mode, one side (read or write) can be variable, while the other is fixed to 32/36 or 64/72.\nBoth sides of the dual-port 36 Kb RAM can be of variable width.Two adjacent 36 Kb block RAMs can be configured as one cascaded 64K × 1 dual-port RAM without any additional logic.\nError Detection and Correction\nEach 64-bit-wide block RAM can generate, store, and ut ilize eight additional Hamming code bi ts and perform single-bit error \ncorrection and double-bit error detection (ECC) during the read process. The ECC logic can also be used when writing to or reading from external 64- to 72-bit-wide memories.\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 17FIFO Controller\nThe built-in FIFO controller for single-clock (synchronous) or dual-clock (asynchronous or multirate) operation increments \nthe internal addresses and provides four handshaking flags: full,  empty, almost full, and almost empty. The almost full and \nalmost empty flags are freely programmable. Similar to the block RAM, the FIFO width and depth are programmable, but the write and read ports always have identical width.\nFirst word fall-through mode presents the first-written word on the data output even before the first read operation. After the  \nfirst word has been read, there is no difference between this mode and the standard mode.\nDigital Signal Processing — DSP Slice\nSome highlights of the DSP functionality include:\n\x81 25 × 18 two\'s complement mult iplier/accumulator high-resolution (48 bit) signal processor\n\x81 Power saving pre-adder to optimize symmetrical filter applications\x81 Advanced features: optional pipelining, optio nal ALU, and dedicated buses for cascading\nDSP applications use many binary multipliers and accumulato rs, best implemented in dedicated DSP slices. The devices in \nthe Zynq-7000 family have many dedicated, full custom, low- power DSP slices, combining high speed with small size while \nretaining system design flexibility.\nEach DSP slice fundamentally consists of a dedicated 25 × 18 bit two\'s complement multiplie r and a 48-bit accumulator, \nboth capable of operating up to 741 MHz. The multiplier ca n be dynamically bypassed, and two 48-bit inputs can feed a \nsingle-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) arithmetic unit (dual 24-bit add/subtract/accumulate or quad 12-bit add/subtract/accumulate), or a logic unit that can generate any one of ten different logic functions of the two operands.\nThe DSP includes an additional pre-adder , typically used in symmetrical filters. This pre-adder improves performance in \ndensely packed designs and reduces the DSP slice count by up to 50%. The DSP also includes a 48-bit-wide Pattern \nDetector that can be used for convergent or symmetric rounding. The pattern detector is also capable of implementing 96-bit-wide logic functions when used in conjunction with the logic unit.\nThe DSP slice provides extensive pipelining and extension capabilities that  enhance the s peed and efficiency of many \napplications beyond digital signal processing, such as wid e dynamic bus shifters, memory address generators, wide bus \nmultiplexers, and memory-mapped I/O register files. The accumulator can also be used as a synchronous up/down counter. \nInput/Output\nSome highlights of the PL input/output functionality include:\n\x81 High-performance SelectIO™ technology with support for 1866 Mb/s DDR3\n\x81 High-frequency decoupling capacitors within the package for enhanced signal integrity\x81 Digitally Controlled Impedance that can be 3-stated for lowest power, high-speed I/O operation\nThe number of I/O pins varies depending on device and packag e size. Each I/O is configurable and can comply with a large \nnumber of I/O standards. With the exception of the supply pins and a few dedicated configuration pins, all other PL pins have the same I/O ca pabilities, constrained only by cert ain banking rules. The Se lectIO resources in Zy nq-7000 and Zynq-7000S \ndevices are classed as either High Range (HR) or High Performance (HP). The HR I/Os offer the widest range of voltage support, from 1.2V to 3.3V. The HP I/Os are optimiz ed for highest performance operation, from 1.2V to 1.8V.\nAll I/O pins are organized in banks, with 50  pins per bank. Each bank has one common V\nCCO output supply, which also \npowers certain input buffers. Some single-ended input buffers require an internally generated or an externally applied reference voltage (V\nREF). There are two VREF pins per bank (except configuration bank 0). A single bank can have only one \nVREF voltage value.\nThe Zynq-7000 family uses a variety of package types to suit the needs of the user, including small form factor wire-bond \npackages for lowest cost; conventional, high performance flip -chip packages; and lidless flip-chip packages that balance \nsmaller form factor with hi gh performance. In the flip-chip packages, the silicon device is  attached to the package substrate \nusing a high-performance flip-chip process. Controlled ESR discrete decoupling capacitors are mounted on the package substrate to optimize signal integrity under simultaneous switching of outputs (SSO) conditions.\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 18I/O Electrical Characteristics\nSingle-ended outputs use a conventional CMOS push/pull output structure driving High towards VCCO or Low towards \nground, and can be put into a high-Z state. The system designer can specify the slew rate and the output strength. The input is always active but is usually ignored wh ile the output is active. Each pin can optionally have a weak pull-up or a weak \npull-down resistor.\nMost signal pin pairs can be configured as differential input pairs or output pairs. Differential input pin pairs can optionall y be \nterminated with a 100 Ω internal resistor. All devices in the Zynq-7000 family support differential standards beyond LVDS: \nRSDS, BLVDS, differential SSTL, and differential HSTL.\nEach of the I/Os supports memory I/O standards, such as si ngle-ended and differential HSTL as well as single-ended SSTL \nand differential SSTL. The SSTL I/O standard can support data rates of up to 1866 Mb/s for DDR3 interfacing applications.\n3-State Digitally Controlled Impe dance and Low-Power I/O Features\nThe 3-state Digitally Controlled Impedance (T_DCI) can control the output drive impedance (series termination) or can \nprovide parallel termination of an input signal to V\nCCO or split (Thevenin) termination to VCCO/2. This allows users to \neliminate off-chip te rmination for signals usin g T_DCI. In addition to board space savings, the termination automatically \nturns off when in output mode or when 3-stated, saving considerable power compared to off-chip termination. The I/Os also have low-power modes for IBUF and IDELAY to provide further power savings, especially when used to implement memory interfaces.\nI/O Logic\nInput and Output Delay\nAll inputs and outputs can be configured as either combinatoria l or registered. Double data rate (DDR) is supported by all \ninputs and outputs. Any input and some outputs can be individu ally delayed by up to 32 increments of 78 ps or 52 ps each. \nSuch delays are implemented as IDELAY and ODELAY. The number of delay steps can be set by configuration and can also be incremented or decremented while in use. \nISERDES and OSERDES\nMany applications combine high-speed, bit-serial I/O with sl ower parallel operation inside the device. This requires a \nserializer and deserializer (SerDes) inside the I/O structure. Each I/O pin possesses an 8-bit IOSERDES (ISERDES and OSERDES) capable of performing serial-to-parallel or parallel-to-serial conversions with programmable widths of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 bits. By cascading two IOSERDES from two adjacent pins (default from differential I/O), wider width conversions of 10 and 14 bits can also be supported. The ISERDES has  a special oversampling mode capable of asynchronous data \nrecovery for applications like a 1.25 Gb/s LVDS I/O-based SGMII interface.\nLow-Power Serial Transceivers\nSome highlights of the low-po wer serial transceivers in th e Zynq-7000 family include:\n\x81 High-performance GTX transceivers capable of up to 12.5 Gb /s line rates with flip-chip packages, up to 6.6 Gb/s with \nlidless flip-chip packages, and GTP transceivers ca pable of up to 6.25 Gb/s with wire-bond packages.\n\x81 Low-power mode optimized for chip-to-chip interfaces.\n\x81 Advanced Transmit pre and post emphasis, and receiver linear (CTLE) and decision feedback equalization (DFE), \nincluding adaptive equalization for additional margin.\nUltra-fast serial data transmission to optical modules, betwee n ICs on the same PCB, over the backplane, or over longer \ndistances is becoming increasingly popular and important to enable customer line cards to scale to 200 Gb/s. It requires \nspecialized dedicated on-chip circuitry and differential I/O capabl e of coping with the signal in tegrity issues at these high \ndata rates.\nThe transceiver counts range from 0 to 16 transceiver circuits. Each serial transceiver is a combined transmitter and \nreceiver. The various serial transceivers c an use a combination of ring oscillators and LC tank arch itecture to allow the ideal  \nblend of flexibility and performance while  enabling IP portability ac ross the family members. Lower data rates can be \nachieved using logic-based oversampling. Th e serial transmitter and receiver are inde pendent circuits that use an advanced \nPLL architecture to multiply the reference frequency input by certain programmable numbers between 4 and 25 to become \nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 19the bit-serial data clock. Each transceiver has a large number of user-definable features and parameters. All of these can be \ndefined during device configuration, and many can also be modified during operation.\nTransmitter\nThe transmitter is fundamentally a parallel-to-serial converter with a conversion ratio of 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, or 80. This allo ws \nthe designer to trade-off datapath width for timing margin in  high-performance designs. These transmitter outputs drive the \nPC board with a single-channel differential output signal. TXOU TCLK is the appropriately divided serial data clock and can \nbe used directly to register the parallel data coming from the internal logic. The incoming parallel data is fed through an optional FIFO and has additional hardware support for the 8B /10B, 64B/66B, or 64B/67B encoding schemes to provide a \nsufficient number of transitions. The bit-serial output signal dr ives two package pins with differential signals. This output \nsignal pair has programmable signal swi ng as well as programmable pre- and post-emphasis to compensate for PC board \nlosses and other interconnect characteristics. For shor ter channels, the swing can be reduced to reduce power \nconsumption.\nReceiver\nThe receiver is fundamentally a serial-to-parallel converter, chan ging the incoming bit-serial differential signal into a paral lel \nstream of words, each 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, or 80 bits. This allo ws the designer to trade-off inte rnal datapath width versus logi c \ntiming margin.  The receiver takes the incoming differential data st ream, feeds it through programmable linear and decision \nfeedback equalizers (to compensate for PC board and other interconnect characteristics), and uses the reference clock input to initiate clock recognition. There is no need for a separate clock line. The data pattern uses non-return-to-zero (NRZ) encoding and optionally guarantees sufficient data transitions by using the selected encoding scheme. Parallel data is then \ntransferred into the PL using the RXUSRCLK clock. For short channels, the transceivers offers a special low power mode \n(LPM) for additional power reduction.\nOut-of-Band Signaling\nThe transceivers provide out-of-band (OOB) signaling, often us ed to send low-speed signals from the transmitter to the \nreceiver while high-speed serial data tran smission is not active. This is typically done when the link is  in a powered-down \nstate or has not yet b een initialized. This benefits PCI Expr ess and SATA/SAS applications.\nIntegrated Block for PCI Express Designs\nHighlights of the integrated block for PCI Express include:\n\x81 Compliant to the PCI Express Base Specificatio n 2.1 with Endpoint a nd Root Port capability \n\x81 Supports Gen1 (2.5 Gb/s) and Gen2 (5 Gb/s)\n\x81 Advanced configuration options, Adva nced Error Reporting ( AER), and End-to-End CRC (ECRC) Adva nced Error \nReporting and ECRC features\nAll devices with transceivers in the Zynq-7000 family include an integrated block for PCI Express technology that can be \nconfigured as an Endpoint or Root Port, compliant to the PCI Express Base Specification Revision 2.1. The Root Port can be used to build the basis for a compatible Root Complex, to allow custom communication between the Zynq-7000 SoC and other devices via the PCI Expres s protocol, and to attach ASSP Endpoint devices, su ch as Ethernet Co ntrollers or Fibre \nChannel HBAs, to the Zynq-7000 SoC.\nThis block is highly configurable to system design requirements  and can operate 1, 2, 4, or 8 lanes at the 2.5 Gb/s and \n5.0 Gb/s data rates. For high-performance applications, advanced buffering techniques of the block offer a flexible maximum payload size of up to 1,024 bytes. The integrated block inte rfaces to the integrated high-speed transceivers for serial \nconnectivity and to block RAMs for data buffering. Combined,  these elements implement the Physical Layer, Data Link \nLayer, and Transaction Layer of the PCI Express protocol.\nXilinx provides a light-weight, configur able, easy-to-use LogiCORE™ IP wrapper t hat ties the various building blocks (the \nintegrated block for PCI Express, the transceivers, block RAM,  and clocking resources) into an Endpoint or Root Port \nsolution. The system designer has control over many configurable parameters: lane width, maximum payload size, PL interface speeds, reference clock frequency, and base address register decoding and filtering.\nXilinx offers a wrapper for the integr ated block: AXI4 (memory mapped). AXI4 (memor y mapped) is designed for Xilinx \nPlatform Studio/EDK design flow and MicroBlaze™ processor based designs.\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 20More information and documentation on solutions for PCI Express designs can be found at: \nhttp://www.xilinx.com /technology/protoco ls/pciexpress.htm .\nXADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)\nHighlights of the XADC architecture include:\n\x81 Dual 12-bit 1 MSPS analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)\n\x81 Up to 17 flexible and user-configurable analog inputs \n\x81 On-chip or external reference option\n\x81 On-chip temperature and power supply sensors\x81 Continuous JTAG access to ADC measurements\nAll devices in the Zynq-7000 family integrate a flexible  analog interface called XADC. When combined with the \nprogrammable logic capab ility, the XADC can address a broa d range of data acquisition a nd monitoring requirements. This \nunique combination of analog and programmable logic is ca lled Analog Mixed Signal. For more information, go to: \nhttp://www.xilin x.com/ams\n.\nThe XADC contains two 12-bit 1 MSPS ADCs with separate track and hold amplifiers, an on-chip analog multiplexer (up to \n17 external analog input channels supported), and on-chip therma l and supply sensors. The two ADCs can be configured to \nsimultaneously sample two external-input analog channels. T he track and hold amplifiers support a range of analog input \nsignal types, including unipolar, bipolar, and differential. T he analog inputs can support signal bandwidths of at least \n500 KHz at sample rates of 1MSPS. It is possible to support higher  analog bandwidths using ex ternal analog multiplexer \nmode with the dedicated analog input (see UG480 , 7 Series FPGAs XADC Dual 12-Bit 1MSPS Analog-to-Dig ital Converter \nUser Guide ).\nThe XADC optionally uses an on-chip refe rence circuit (±1%), thereby eliminat ing the need for any external active \ncomponents for basic on-chip monitoring of temperature and power  supply rails. To achieve the full 12-bit performance of the \nADCs, an external 1.25V reference IC is recommended. \nIf the XADC is not instantiated in a design, then by default it di gitizes the output of all on-chip sensors. The most recent \nmeasurement results (together with maximum and minimum readings) are stored in dedicated registers for access at any time via the JTAG interface. User-defined alarm threshol ds can automatically indicate over-temperature events and \nunacceptable power supply variation. A us er-specified limit (for example, 100°C) can be used to initiate an automatic \npower-down.\nSystem-Level Functions\nSeveral functions span both the PS and PL and include:\n\x81 Reset management\n\x81 Clock management\n\x81 Device configuration\n\x81 Hardware and software debug support \x81 Power management\nReset Management\nThe reset management  function provides the ability to re set the entire device or individual units withi n it. The PS supports \nthese reset functions and signals:\n\x81 External and internal power-on reset signal\n\x81 Warm reset\x81 Watchdog timer reset\n\x81 User resets to PL\n\x81 Software, watchdog timer, or JTAG provided resets\x81 Security violation reset (locked down reset)\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 21Clock Management\nIn the Zynq-7000 family, the PS is equip ped with three phase-lo cked loops (PLLs), providing flex ibility in configuring the cloc k \ndomains within the PS. There ar e three primary clock domains of interest within the PS. These include the APU, the DDR \ncontroller, and the I/O peripherals (IOP). The frequencies of all of these domains can be configured independently under software control.\nPS Boot and Device Configuration\nZynq-7000 and Zynq-7000S devices use a multi-stage boot proc ess that supports both a non-secure and a secure boot. The \nPS is the master of the boot and configuration process. For a secure boot, the PL must be powered on to enable the use of the security block located within the PL, which provides 256-bit AES and SHA decryp tion/authentication. \nUpon reset, the device mode pins are read to determine the primary boot device to be used: NOR, NAND, Quad-SPI, SD, \nor JTAG. JTAG can only be used as a non-secure boot sour ce and is intended for debugging purposes. One of the ARM \nCortex-A9 CPUs executes code out of on -chip ROM and copies the first stage boot loader (FSBL) from the boot device to \nthe OCM. \nAfter copying the FSBL to OCM,  the processor executes the FSBL. Xilinx supp lies example FSBLs or users can create their \nown. The FSBL initiates the boot of the PS and can load and configure the PL, or configuration of the PL can be deferred to a later stage. The FSBL typically loads either a user applicatio n or an optional second stage boot loader (SSBL) such as \nU-Boot. Users obtain the SSBL from Xilinx  or a third party, or they can create their own SSBL. The SSBL continues the boot \nprocess by loading code from any of the primary boot devices or from other sources such as USB, Ethernet, etc. If the FSBL did not configure the PL, the SSBL can do so, or again, the configuration can be deferred to a later stage.\nThe static memory interface controller (NAND, NOR, or Quad- SPI) is configured using default settings. To improve device \nconfiguration speed, these settings can be modified by information provided in the boot image header. The ROM boot image is not user readable or callable after boot. \nHardware and Software Debug Support\nThe debug system used in the Zynq-7000 family is based on ARM’s CoreSight architecture. It uses ARM CoreSight \ncomponents including an embedded trace buffer (ETB), a program trace macrocell (PTM), and an instrument trace macrocell (ITM). This enables instruction trace features as well as hardware breakpoints and triggers. The programmable \nlogic can be debugged with the integrated logic analyzer.\nDebug Ports\nTwo JTAG ports are available and can be chained together or used separately. When chained together, a single port is used \nfor ARM processor code downloads and run-time control operat ions, PL configuration, and PL debug with the ChipScope™ \nPro embedded logic analyzer. This enables tools such as the Xilinx Software Development Kit (SDK) and ChipScope Pro \nanalyzer to share a single download cable from Xilinx.\nWhen the JTAG chain is split, one port is used for PS suppor t, including direct access to the ARM DAP interface. This \nCoreSight interface enables the use of ARM-compliant debug and software development tools such as Development Studio 5 (DS-5™). The other JTAG port can then be used by the Xilinx FPGA t ools for access to the PL, including \nconfiguration bitstream downloads and PL debug with the integrated logic analyzer. In this mode, users can download to, and debug the PL in the same manner as a stand-alone FPGA.\nZynq-7000 SoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS190 (v1.11.1) July 2, 2018 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 22Power Management\nThe PS and PL reside on different power planes. This enables the PS and PL to be connected to independent power rails, \neach with its own dedicated power supply pins. If PL power-off mode is not needed, the user can tie the PS and PL power rails together. When the PS is in power-off mode, it holds the PL in a permanent reset condition. The power control for the PL is accomplished through external pins to the PL. External  power management circuitry can be used to control power. The \nexternal power management circuitry coul d be controlled by software and the PS GPIO. \nPower Modes\nThese are a few of the power savings modes offered by the Zynq-7000 family: \n\x81 Programmable Logic Power Off (Sleep)\n\x81 The PS and PL reside on different power planes and the PS ca n run with the PL powered off. For security reasons, the PL \ncannot be powered on before the PS. The PL requires reconf iguration after each power-on. The user should take PL \nconfiguration time into consideration when using this power savings mode.\n\x81 PS Clock Control\n\x81 The PS can be run at a reduced clock rate down to 30 MHz usin g the internal PLLs. The clock rate can be changed dynamically. \nTo change the clock dynamically, the user must unlock the system control register  to access the PS clock control register or th e \nclock generation control register.\n\x81 Single Processor Mode\n\x81 In this mode, the second Cortex-A9 CPU is switched off us ing clock gating and the first CPU is kept fully operational.\nPower Examples\nPower for the devices in the Zynq-7000 fam ily varies depending on the utilization of t he PL resources, a nd the frequency of \nthe PS and PL.
