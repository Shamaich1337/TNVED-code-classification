Detailed Block Diagram \nOVERVIEW \nThe AD9912 is a high performance, low noise, 14-bit DDS \nclock synthesizer with integrated comparators for applications \ndesiring an agile, finely tuned square or sinusoidal output signal. \nA digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) is implemented using a \ndirect digital synthesizer (DDS) with an integrated output DAC, \nclocked by the system clock.  \nA bypassable PLL-based frequency multiplier is present, \nenabling use of an inexpensive, low frequency source for the \nsystem clock. For best jitter performance, the system clock PLL should be bypassed, and a low noise, high frequency system \nclock should be provided directly. Sampling theory sets an upper \nbound for the DDS output frequency at 50% of f\nS (where f S is \nthe DAC sample rate), but a practical limitation of 40% of f\nS is generally recommended to allow for the selectivity of the \nrequired off-chip reconstruction filter.  \nThe output signal from the reconstruction filter can be fed back \nto the AD9912 to be processed through the output circuitry. The output circuitry includes HSTL and CMOS output buffers, as well as a frequency doubler for applications that need \nfrequencies above the Nyquist level of the DDS. \nThe AD9912 also offers preprogrammed frequency profiles that \nallow the user to generate frequencies without programming \nthe part. The individual functional blocks are described in the \nfollowing sections.  \nDIRECT DIGITAL SYNTHESIZER (DDS) \nThe frequency of the sinusoid generated by the DDS is \ndetermined by a frequency tuning word (FTW), which is a \ndigital (that is, numeric) value. Unlike an analog sinusoidal generator, a DDS uses digital building blocks and operates as a sampled system. Thus, it requires a sampling clock (f\nS) that \nserves as the fundamental timing source of the DDS. The accumulator behaves as a modulo-2\n48 counter with a program-\nmable step size that is determined by the frequency tuning word \n(FTW). A block diagram of the DDS is shown in Figure 40 . \n \nAD9912  \n \nRev.

On each cycle of f\nS, the accumulator \nadds the value of the FTW to the running total of its output. For example, given an FTW = 5, the accumulator increments the count by 5 sec on each f\nS cycle. Over time, the accumulator \nreaches the upper end of its capacity (248 in this case) and then \nrolls over, retaining the excess. The average rate at which the accumulator rolls over establishes the frequency of the output sinusoid.

DAC Output \nRECONSTRUCTION FILTER \nThe origin of the output clock signal produced by the AD9912 \nis the combined DDS and DAC. The DAC output signal appears \nas a sinusoid sampled at f S. The frequency of the sinusoid is \ndetermined by the frequency tuning word (FTW) that appears at the input to the DDS. The DAC output is typically passed \nthrough an external reconstruction filter that serves to remove \nthe artifacts of the sampling process and other spurs outside the filter bandwidth. If desired, the signal can then be brought back \non-chip to be converted to a square wave that is routed internally \nto the output clock driver or the 2× DLL multiplier. \n  AD9912\n \nRev.

DAC Spectrum vs. Re construction Filter Response \n \nBecause the DAC constitutes a sampled system, its output must \nbe filtered so that the analog waveform accurately represents the \ndigital samples supplied to the DAC input. The unfiltered DAC output contains the (typically) desired baseband signal, which extends from dc to the Nyquist frequency (f\nS/2). It also contains \nimages of the baseband signal that theoretically extend to infinity. \nNotice that the odd images (shown in Figure 42 ) are mirror \nimages of the baseband signal. Furthermore, the entire DAC \noutput spectrum is affected by a sin(x)/x response, which is \ncaused by the sample-and-hold nature of the DAC output signal. \nFor applications using the fundamental frequency of the DAC \noutput, the response of the reconstruction filter should preserve the baseband signal (Image 0), while completely rejecting all \nother images. However, a practical filter implementation \ntypically exhibits a relatively flat pass band that covers the desired output frequency plus 20%, rolls off as steeply as possible, and then maintains significant (though not complete) rejection of the remaining images. Depending on how close unwanted spurs are to the desired signal, a third-, fifth-, or seventh-order elliptic low-pass filter is common. \nSome applications operate off an image above the Nyquist \nfrequency, and those applications use a band-pass filter instead \nof a low-pass filter. \nThe design of the reconstruction filter has a significant impact \non the overall signal performance. Therefore, good filter design and implementation techniques are important for obtaining the \nbest possible jitter results. FDBK_IN INPUTS \nThe FDBK_IN pins serve as the input to the comparators and \noutput drivers of the AD9912. Typically, these pins are used to \nreceive the signal generated by the DDS after it has been band-\nlimited by the external reconstruction filter.  \nA diagram of the FDBK_IN input pins is provided in Figure 43 , \nwhich includes some of the internal components used to bias \nthe input circuitry. Note that the FDBK_IN input pins are internally biased to a dc level of ~1 V . Care should be taken to \nensure that any external connections do not disturb the dc bias \nbecause this may significantly degrade performance. \n06763-03515kΩ15kΩ ~1pF\n~1pFTO S-DIVIDER\nAND CLOCK\nOUTPUT SECTION\nAVSS\n~1V\nAVSS~2pF+FDBK_IN\nFDBK_INB\n \nFigure 43.

F | Page 20 of 40 SYSCLK INPUTS \nFunctional Description \nAn external time base connects to the AD9912 at the SYSCLK \npins to generate the internal high frequency system clock (f S).  \nThe SYSCLK inputs can be operated in one of the following \nthree modes:  \n• SYSCLK PLL bypassed \n• SYSCLK PLL enabled with input signal generated externally \n• Crystal resonator with SYSCLK PLL enabled  \nA functional diagram of the system clock generator is shown in Figure 44 .  \nThe SYSCLK PLL multiplier path is enabled by a Logic 0 (default) \nin the PD SYSCLK PLL bit (Register 0x0010, Bit 4) of the I/O \nregister map. The SYSCLK PLL multiplier can be driven from \nthe SYSCLK input pins by one of two means, depending on the logic level applied to the 1.8 V CMOS CLKMODESEL pin. When CLKMODESEL = 0, a crystal can be connected directly across the SYSCLK pins. When CLKMODESEL = 1, the \nmaintaining amp is disabled, and an external frequency source \n(such as an oscillator or signal generator) can be connected directly to the SYSCLK input pins. Note that CLKMODESEL = 1 \ndoes not disable the system clock PLL. \nThe maintaining amp on the AD9912 SYSCLK pins is intended \nfor 25 MHz, 3.2 mm × 2.5 mm AT cut fundamental mode crystals with a maximum motional resistance of 100 Ω. The following \ncrystals, listed in alphabetical or der, meet these criteria (as of \nthe revision date of this data sheet): \n• AVX/Kyocera CX3225SB \n• ECS ECX-32 \n• Epson/Toyocom TSX-3225 \n• Fox FX3225BS \n• NDK NX3225SA \n \n Note that although these crystals meet the preceding criteria \naccording to their data sheets, Analog Devices, Inc., does not \nguarantee their operation with the AD9912, nor does Analog \nDevices endorse one supplier of crystals over another. \nWhen the SYSCLK PLL multiplier path is disabled, the AD9912 \nmust be driven by a high frequency signal source (250 MHz to \n1 GHz). The signal thus applied to the SYSCLK input pins becomes \nthe internal DAC sampling clock (f S) after passing through an \ninternal buffer.  \nIt is important to note that when bypassing the system clock \nPLL, the LOOP_FILTER pin (Pin 31) should be pulled down to \nthe analog ground with a 1 kΩ resistor. \nSYSCLK PLL Doubler \nThe SYSCLK PLL multiplier path offers an optional SYSCLK \nPLL doubler. This block comes before the SYSCLK PLL \nmultiplier and acts as a frequency doubler by generating a pulse on each edge of the SYSCLK input signal. The SYSCLK PLL \nmultiplier locks to the falling edges of this regenerated signal.  \nThe impetus for doubling the frequency at the input of the \nSYSCLK PLL multiplier is that an improvement in overall phase \nnoise performance can be realized. The main drawback is that \nthe doubler output is not a rectangular pulse with a constant duty cycle even for a perfectly symmetric SYSCLK input signal. This results in a subharmonic appearing at the same frequency as the SYSCLK input signal, and the magnitude of the subharmonic \ncan be quite large. When employing the doubler, care must be \ntaken to ensure that the loop bandwidth of the SYSCLK PLL \nmultiplier adequately suppresses the subharmonic. \nThe benefit offered by the doubler depends on the magnitude \nof the subharmonic, the loop bandwidth of the SYSCLK PLL multiplier, and the overall phase noise requirements of the specific application. In many applications, the AD9912 clock output is applied to the input of another PLL, and the subhar-\nmonic is often suppressed by the relatively narrow bandwidth of \nthe downstream PLL. \nNote that generally, the benefits of the SYSCLK PLL doubler are \nrealized for SYSCLK input frequencies of 25 MHz and above.  \n06763-0361\n01\n0\n10\nBIPOLAR\nEDGE\nDETECTOR2\n2\nWITH CRYSTAL\nRESONATOR2\n21\n02\n2\n2\nSYSCLK\nPLL\nENABLEDWITH EXTERNAL DRIVESYSCLK PLL BYPASSED\nSYSCLK\nPLL\nMULTIPLIER1\n0BIPOLAR EDGE DETECTOR\n(I/O REGISTER BIT)PD SYSCLK PLL\n(I/O REGISTER BIT)\nDAC\nSAMPLE\nCLOCK\nLOOP_FILTERSYSCLK\nSYSCLKB\nCLKMODESEL2\n \nFigure 44.

Block Diagram of the SYSCLK PLL \nThe SYSCLK PLL multiplier has a 1 GHz VCO at its core. \nA phase/frequency detector (PFD) and charge pump provide \nthe steering signal to the VCO in typical PLL fashion. The PFD \noperates on the falling edge transitions of the input signal, which means that the loop locks on the negative edges of the reference signal. The charge pump gain is controlled via the I/O register map by selecting one of three possible constant current sources \nranging from 125 μA to 375 μA in 125 μA steps. The center \nfrequency of the VCO is also adjustable via the I/O register map and provides high/low gain selection. The feedback path from VCO to PFD consists of a fixed divide-by-2 prescaler followed by a programmable divide-by-N block, where 2 ≤ N ≤ 33. This \nlimits the overall divider range to any even integer from 4 to 66, \ninclusive. The value of N is programmed via the I/O register map via a 5-bit word that spans a range of 0 to 31, but the internal logic automatically adds a bias of 2 to the value entered, extending the range to 33. Care should be taken when choosing these values so as not to exceed the maximum input frequency of the \nSYSCLK PLL phase detector or SYSCLK PLL doubler. These \nvalues can be found in the AC Specifications section. \nExternal Loop Filter (SYSCLK PLL) \nThe loop bandwidth of the SYSCLK PLL multiplier can be \nadjusted by means of three external components as shown in \nFigure 46 . The nominal gain of the VCO is 800 MHz/V . The \nrecommended component values (shown in Table 6 ) establish \na loop bandwidth of approximately 1.6 MHz with the charge \npump current set to 250 μA.

Care should be taken to ensure that any external connections do not disturb the dc bias because this may significantly degrade performance. \nGenerally, it is recommended that the SYSCLK inputs be \nac-coupled, except when using a crystal resonator. \nOUTPUT CLOCK DRIVERS AND 2× FREQUENCY \nMULTIPLIER \nThere are two output drivers provided by the AD9912. The \nprimary output driver supports differential 1.8 V HSTL output \nlevels, while the secondary supports either 1.8 V or 3.3 V CMOS \nlevels, depending on whether Pin 37 is driven at 1.8 V or 3.3 V . \nThe primary differential driver nominally provides an output \nvoltage with 100 Ω load applied differentially. The source \nimpedance of the driver is approximately 100 Ω for most of \nthe output clock period; during transition between levels, the source impedance reaches a maximum of about 500 Ω. The driver is designed to support output frequencies of up to and \nbeyond the OC-12 network rate of 622.08 MHz. \nThe output clock can also be powered down by a control bit in \nthe I/O register map. \nPrimary 1.8 V Differential HSTL Driver \nThe DDS produces a sinusoidal clock signal that is sampled at \nthe system clock rate. This DDS output signal is routed off chip \nwhere it is passed through an analog filter and brought back on chip for buffering and, if necessary, frequency doubling. Where \npossible, for the best jitter performance, it is recommended that \nthe frequency doubler be bypassed. \nThe 1.8 V HSTL output should be ac-coupled, with 100 Ω termi-\nnation at the destination. The driver design has low jitter injection for frequencies in the range of 50 MHz to 750 MHz. Refer to the \nAC Specifications section for the exact frequency limits.  \n2× Frequency Multiplier \nThe AD9912 can be configured (via the I/O register map) with \nan internal 2× delay-locked loop (DLL) multiplier at the input \nof the primary clock driver. The extra octave of frequency gain allows the AD9912 to provide output clock frequencies that exceed the range available from the DDS alone. These settings \nare found in Register 0x0010 and Register 0x0200. \nThe input to the DLL consists of the filtered DDS output signal \nafter it has been squared up by an integrated clock receiver \ncircuit. The DLL can accept input frequencies in the range of \n200 MHz to 400 MHz. \nSingle-Ended CMOS Output \nIn addition to the high-speed differential output clock driver, \nthe AD9912 provides an independent, single-ended output, \nCMOS clock driver that is very good for frequencies up to \n150 MHz. The signal path for the CMOS clock driver can either \ninclude or bypass the CMOS output divider.  If the CMOS output divider is bypassed, the HSTL and CMOS \ndrivers are the same frequency as the signal presented at the FDBK_IN pins. When using the CMOS output in this configu-ration, the DDS output frequency should be in the range of \n30 MHz to 150 MHz. At low output frequencies (<30 MHz), the \nlow slew rate of the DAC results in a higher noise floor. This can be remedied by running the DDS at 100 MHz or greater and using the CMOS divider. At an output frequency of 50 MHz, the best technique depends on the user’s application. Running \nthe DDS at 200 MHz, and using a CMOS divider of 4, results in \na lower noise floor, but at the expense of close-in phase noise. \nAt frequencies greater than 150 MHz, the HSTL output should \nbe used. \nCMOS Output Divider (S-Divider) \nThe CMOS output divider is 16 bi ts cascaded with an additional \ndivide-by-two. The divider is therefore capable of integer division \nfrom 1 to 65,535 (index of 1) or from 2 to 131,070 (index of 2). \nThe divider is programmed via the I/O register map to trigger \non either the rising (default) or falling edge of the feedback \nsignal. \nThe CMOS output divider is an integer divider capable of \nhandling frequencies well above the Nyquist limit of the DDS. The S-divider/2 bit (Register 0x0106, Bit 0) must be set when \nFDBK_IN is greater than 400 MHz.  \nNote that the actual output divider values equal the value stored \nin the output divider register minus one. Therefore, to have an \noutput divider of one, the user writes zeros to the output divider \nregister. \nHARMONIC SPUR REDUCTION \nThe most significant spurious signals produced by the DDS are \nharmonically related to the desired output frequency of the DDS. \nThe source of these harmonic spurs can usually be traced to the DAC, and the spur level is in the −60 dBc range. This ratio represents a level that is about 10 bits below the full-scale output of the DAC (10 bits down is 2\n−10, or 1/1024). \nSuch a spur can be reduced by combining the original signal \nwith a replica of the spur, but offset in phase by 180°. This idea \nis the foundation of the technique used to reduce harmonic spurs in the AD9912. Because the DAC has 14-bit resolution, a −60 dBc spur can be synthesized using only the lower 4 bits of the DAC full-scale range. That is, the 4 LSBs can create an output \nlevel that is approximately 60 dB below the full-scale level of the \nDAC (commensurate with a −60 dBc spur). This fact gives rise to a means of digitally reducing harmonic spurs or their aliased images in the DAC output spectrum by digitally adding a sinusoid at the input of the DAC with a similar magnitude as the offending spur, but shifted in phase to produce destructive interference. \n  AD9912\n \nRev. F | Page 23 of 40 The procedure for tuning the spur reduction is as follows:  Although the worst spurs tend to be harmonic in origin, the fact \nthat the DAC is part of a sampled system results in the possibility of spurs appearing in the output spectrum that are not harmoni-cally related to the fundamental. For example, if the DAC is \nsampled at 1 GHz and generates an output sinusoid of 170 MHz, \nthe fifth harmonic would normally be at 850 MHz. However, because of the sampling process, this spur appears at 150 MHz, only 20 MHz away from the fundamental. Therefore, when attempting to reduce DAC spurs it is important to know the \nactual location of the harmonic spur in the DAC output \nspectrum based on the DAC sample rate so that its harmonic \nnumber can be reduced. 1.\n Determine which offending harmonic spur to reduce and \nits amplitude. Enter that harmonic number into Bit 0 to  \nBit 3 of Register 0x0500/Register 0x0505.  \n2. Turn off the fundamental by setting Bit 7 of Register 0x0013 \nand enable the SpurKiller channel by setting Bit 7 of \nRegister 0x0500/Register 0x0505.  \n3. Adjust the amplitude of the SpurKiller channel so that it matches the amplitude of the offending spur.  \n4.\n Turn the fundamental on by clearing Bit 7 of Register 0x0013. \n5. Adjust the phase of the SpurKiller channel so that maximum interference is achieved.  The mechanics of performing harmonic spur reduction is shown \nin Figure 48 . It essentially consists of two additional DDS cores \noperating in parallel with the original DDS. This enables the user to reduce two different harmonic spurs from the second to the 15\nth with nine bits of phase offset control (±π) and eight bits of \namplitude control. Note that the SpurKiller setting is sensitive to the loading of the DAC output pins, and that a DDS reset is required if a SpurKiller channel is turned off. The DDS can be reset by setting Bit 0 of Register 0x0012, and resetting the part is not necessary. \nThe performance improvement offered by this technique varies \nwidely and depends on the conditions used. Given this extreme \nvariability, it is impossible to define a meaningful specification to guarantee SpurKiller performance. Current data indicate that a 6 dB to 8 dB improvement is possible for a given output frequency using a common setting over process, temperature, \nand voltage. There are frequencies, however, where a common \nsetting can result in much greater improvement. Manually adjusting the SpurKiller settings on individual parts can result \nin more than 30 dB of spurious performance improvement.  The dynamic range of the cancellation signal is further aug-\nmented by a gain bit associated with each channel. When this bit is set, the magnitude of the cancellation signal is doubled by employing a 1-bit left-shift of the data. However, the shift operation reduces the granularity of the cancellation signal magnitude. The full-scale amplitude of a cancellation spur is \napproximately −60 dBc when the gain bit is a Logic 0 and \napproximately −54 dBc when the gain bit is a Logic 1. \n \n06763-0400\n1\n101414 19 19Q D48 14\nDAC\n(14-BIT)DAC_OUT\nDAC_OUTB\n4\n9\n4\n9\n8\n8SHIFT\n10\nSHIFTHEADROOM\nCORRECTION\nHARMONIC SPUR CANCELLATIONCH1 HARMONIC NUMBER\nCH1 CANCELLATION PHASE OFFSET\nCH2 HARMONIC NUMBER\nCH2 CANCELLATION PHASE OFFSET\nCH1 CANCELLATION MAGNITUDE\nCH2 CANCELLATION MAGNITUDECH1 GAIN\nCH2 GAINSPUR\nCANCELLATION\nENABLE\nANGLE TO\nAMPLITUDE\nCONVERSIONDDS\nPHASE\nOFFSET\n144848-BIT ACCUMULATORDDS\n48-BIT\nFREQUENCY\nTURNING WORD\n(FTW)\nSYSCLK\n2-CHANNEL\nHARMONIC\nFREQUENCY\nGENERATOR\nCH1\nCH2DAC_RSETDAC I-SET\nREGISTERS\nAND LOGIC\n \nFigure 48.

F | Page 25 of 40 POWER-UP \nPOWER-ON RESET \nOn initial power-up, the AD9912 internally generates a 75 ns \nRESET pulse. The pulse is initiated when both of the following \ntwo conditions are met: \n• The 3.3 V supply is greater than 2.35 V ± 0.1 V . \n• The 1.8 V supply is greater than 1.4 V ± 0.05 V . \nLess than 1 ns after RESET goes high, the S1 to S4 configuration \npins go high impedance and remain high impedance until \nRESET is deactivated. This allows strapping and configuration \nduring RESET. \nBecause of this reset sequence, external power supply sequenc-\ning is not critical. \nDEFAULT OUTPUT FREQUENCY ON POWER-UP \nThe four status pins (S1 to S4) are used to define the output \nfrequency of the DDS at power-up even though the I/O registers \nhave not yet been programmed. At power-up, internal logic initiates a reset pulse of about 10 ns. During this time, S1 to S4 \nbriefly function as input pins and can be driven externally. Any \nlogic levels thus applied are transferred to a 4-bit register on the falling edge of the internally initiated pulse. The same behavior \noccurs when the RESET pin is asserted manually. \nSetting up S1 to S4 for default DDS startup is accomplished by \nconnecting a resistor to each pin (either pull-up or pull-down) to produce the desired bit pattern, yielding 16 possible states \nthat are used both to address an internal 8 × 16 ROM and to \nselect the SYSCLK mode (see Table 8 ). The ROM contains eight \n16-bit DDS frequency tuning words (FTWs), one of which is selected by the state of the S1 to S3 pins. The selected FTW is transferred to the FTW0 register in the I/O register map without the need for an I/O update. This ensures that the DDS \ngenerates the selected frequency even if the I/O registers have \nnot been programmed. The state of the S4 pin selects whether the internal system clock is generated by means of the internal SYSCLK PLL multiplier or not (see the SYSCLK Inputs  section \nfor details). The DDS output frequency listed in Table 8  assumes that \nthe internal DAC sampling frequency (f\nS) is 1 GHz. These \nfrequencies scale 1:1 with f S, meaning that other start-up \nfrequencies are available by varying the SYSCLK frequency. \nAt startup, the internal frequency multiplier defaults to 40× \nwhen the Xtal/PLL mode is selected via the status pins. \nTable 8.

F | Page 26 of 40 POWER SUPPLY PARTITIONING \nThe AD9912 features multiple power supplies, and their power \nconsumption varies with its configuration. This section covers which power supplies can be grouped together and how the \npower consumption of each block varies with frequency.  \nThe numbers quoted here are for comparison only. Refer to the \nSpecifications  section for exact numbers. With each group, use \nbypass capacitors of 1 μF in parallel with a 10 μF. \nThe recommendations here are for typical applications, and for \nthese applications, there are four groups of power supplies: \n3.3 V digital, 3.3 V analog, 1.8 V digital, and 1.8 V analog.  \nApplications demanding the highest performance may require \nadditional power supply isolation. \nImportant: All power supply pins must receive power regardless \nof whether that block is used. \n3.3 V SUPPLIES \nDVDD_I/O (Pin 1) and AVDD3 (Pin 14) \nAlthough one of these pins is analog and the other is digital, \nthese two 3.3 V supplies can be grouped together. The power \nconsumption on Pin 1 varies dynamically with serial port \nactivity.  \nAVDD3 (Pin 37) \nThis is the CMOS driver supply. It can be either 1.8 V or 3.3 V , \nand its power consumption is a function of the output frequency \nand loading of OUT_CMOS (Pin 38).  \nIf the CMOS driver is used at 3.3 V , this supply should be \nisolated from other 3.3 V supplies with a ferrite bead to avoid a spur at the output frequency. If the HSTL driver is not used, AVDD3 (Pin 37) can be connected (using a ferrite bead) to AVDD3 (Pin 46, Pin 47, and Pin 49). If the HSTL driver is used, connect AVDD3 (Pin 37) to Pin 1 and Pin 14, using a ferrite bead. \nIf the CMOS driver is used at 1.8 V , AVDD3 (Pin 37) can be \nconnected to AVDD (Pin 36). \nIf the CMOS driver is not used, AVDD3 (Pin 37) can be tied \ndirectly to the 1.8 V AVDD (Pin 36) and the CMOS driver \npowered down using Register 0x0010. \nAVDD3 (Pin 46, Pin 47, and Pin 49) \nThese are 3.3 V DAC power supplies that typically consume \nabout 25 mA. At a minimum, a ferrite bead should be used to \nisolate these from other 3.3 V supplies, with a separate regulator \nbeing ideal.  1.8 V SUPPLIES \nDVDD (Pin 3, Pin 5, and Pin 7) \nThese pins should be grouped together and isolated from the \n1.8 V AVDD supplies. For most applications, a ferrite bead \nprovides sufficient isolation, but a separate regulator may be necessary for applications demanding the highest performance. The current consumption of this group increases from about \n160 mA at a system clock of 700 MHz to about 205 mA at a \nsystem clock of 1 GHz. There is also a slight (~5%) increase as \nf\nOUT increases from 50 MHz to 400 MHz. \nAVDD (Pin 11, Pin 19, Pin 23, Pin 24, Pin 36, Pin 42,  \nPin 44, and Pin 45) \nThese pins can be grouped together and should be isolated from \nother 1.8 V supplies. A separate regulator is recommended. At \na minimum, a ferrite bead should be used for isolation. \nAVDD (Pin 53) \nThis 1.8 V supply consumes about 40 mA. The supply can be \nrun off the same regulator as the 1.8 V AVDD group, with a \nferrite bead to isolate Pin 53 from the rest of the 1.8 V AVDD group. However, for applications demanding the highest performance, a separate regulator is recommended. \nAVDD (Pin 25, Pin 26, Pin 29, and Pin 30) \nThese system clock PLL power pins should be grouped together and isolated from other 1.8 V AVDD supplies.  \nAt a minimum, it is recommended that Pin 25 and Pin 30 be \ntied together and isolated from the aggregate AVDD 1.8 V supply with a ferrite bead. Likewise, Pin 26 and Pin 29 can also \nbe tied together, with a ferrite bead isolating them from the same \naggregate 1.8 V supply. The loop filter for the system clock PLL \nshould directly connect to Pin 26 and Pin 29 (see Figure 46 ).  \nApplications demanding the highest performance may need to have these four pins powered by their on their own LDO. \nIf the system clock PLL is bypassed, the loop filter pin (Pin 31) \nshould be pulled down to analog ground using a 1 kΩ resistor. Pin 25, Pin 26, Pin 29, and Pin 30 should be included in the large 1.8 V AVDD power supply group. In this mode, isolation of these pins is not critical, and these pins consume almost no power. \n \n  AD9912\n \nRev. F | Page 27 of 40 SERIAL CONTROL PORT \nThe AD9912 serial control port is a flexible, synchronous, serial \ncommunications port that allows an easy interface with many industry-standard microcontrollers and microprocessors. Single or multiple byte transfers are supported, as well as MSB first or \nLSB first transfer formats. The AD9912 serial control port can \nbe configured for a single bidirectional I/O pin (SDIO only) or \nfor two unidirectional I/O pins (SDIO and SDO).  \nNote that all serial port operations (such as the frequency \ntuning word update) depend on the presence of the DAC \nsystem clock. \nSERIAL CONTROL PORT PIN DESCRIPTIONS \nSCLK (serial clock) is the serial shift clock. This pin is an input. \nSCLK is used to synchronize serial control port reads and writes. \nWrite data bits are registered on the rising edge of this clock, \nand read data bits are registered on the falling edge. This pin \nhas an internal pull-down resistor.  \nSDIO (serial data input/output) is a dual-purpose pin and \nacts as input only or input/output. The AD9912 defaults to bidirectional pins for I/O. Alternatively, SDIO can be used as a unidirectional I/O pin by writing to the SDO active bit (Register 0x0000, Bit 0 = 1). In this case, SDIO is the input, and SDO is the output. \nSDO\n (serial data out) is used only in the unidirectional I/O mode \n(Register 0x0000, Bit 0 = 1) as a separate output pin for reading \nback data. Bidirectional I/O mode (using SDIO as both input and output) is active by default (SDO active bit: Register 0x0000, \nBit 0 = 0). \nCSB\n (chip select bar) is an active low control that gates the read \nand write cycles. When CSB is high, SDO and SDIO are in a high \nimpedance state. This pin is internally pulled up by a 100 kΩ \nresistor to 3.3 V . It should not be left floating. See the Operation \nof Serial Control Port  section on the use of the CSB in a \ncommunication cycle. \n06763-041AD9912\nSERIAL\nCONTROL\nPORTSCLK (PIN 64)\nSDIO (PIN 63)\nSDO (PIN 62)\nCSB (PIN 61)\n \nFigure 49. Serial Control Port \nOPERATION OF SERIAL CONTROL PORT \nFraming a Communication Cycle with CSB \nA communication cycle (a write or a read operation) is gated by the CSB line. CSB must be brought low to initiate a communica-\ntion cycle.  \nCSB stall high is supported in modes where three or fewer bytes \nof data (plus the instruction data) are transferred ([W1:W0] must be set to 00, 01, or 10; see Table 9 ). In these modes, CSB \ncan temporarily return high on any byte boundary, allowing time for the system controller to process the next byte. CSB can go high on byte boundaries only and can go high during either part (instruction or data) of the transfer. During this period, the serial control port state machine enters a wait state until all data has been sent. If the system controller decides to abort the transfer \nbefore all of the data is sent, the state machine must be reset by \neither completing the remaining transfer or by returning the CSB low for at least one complete SCLK cycle (but fewer than eight SCLK cycles). Raising the CSB on a nonbyte boundary terminates \nthe serial transfer and flushes the buffer. \nIn the streaming mode ([W1:W0] = 11), any number of data \nbytes can be transferred in a continuous stream. The register \naddress is automatically incremented or decremented (see the \nMSB/LSB First Transfers  section). CSB must be raised at the end \nof the last byte to be transferred, thereby ending the stream mode. \nCommunication Cycle—Instruction Plus Data \nThere are two parts to a communication cycle with the AD9912. The first writes a 16-bit instruction word into the AD9912, coin-\ncident with the first 16 SCLK rising edges. The instruction word \nprovides the AD9912 serial control port with information regarding the data transfer, which is the second part of the communication cycle. The instruction word defines whether the upcoming data transfer is a read or a write, the number of \nbytes in the data transfer, and the starting register address for \nthe first byte of the data transfer.  \nWrite \nIf the instruction word is for a write operation (I15 = 0), the \nsecond part is the transfer of data into the serial control port buffer of the AD9912. The length of the transfer (1, 2, or 3 bytes, \nor streaming mode) is indicated by two bits ([W1:W0]) in the instruction byte. The length of the transfer indicated by [W1:W0] does not include the 2-byte instruction. CSB can be raised after each sequence of eight bits to stall the bus (except after the last byte, where it ends the cycle). When the bus is stalled, the serial \ntransfer resumes when CSB is lowered. Stalling on nonbyte \nboundaries resets the serial control port. \nThere are three types of registers on the AD9912: buffered, live, \nand read only. Buffered (also referred to as mirrored) registers require an I/O update to transfer the new values from a temporary buffer on the chip to the actual register and are marked with an M in the Type column of the register map. \nToggling the IO_UPDATE pin or writing a 1 to the register \nupdate bit (Register 0x0005, Bit 0) causes the update to occur. Because any number of bytes of data can be changed before issuing an update command, the update simultaneously enables all register changes that have occurred since any previous update. \nLive registers do not require I/O update; they update immediately \nafter being written. Read-only registers ignore write commands and are marked RO in the Type column of the register map. An \nAC in this column indicates that the register is autoclearing. \n \nAD9912  \n \nRev. F | Page 28 of 40 Read \nIf the instruction word is for a read operation (I15 = 1), the next \nN × 8 SCLK cycles clock out the data from the address specified \nin the instruction word, where N is 1, 2, 3, or 4, as determined \nby [W1:W0]. In this case, 4 is used for streaming mode where four or more words are transferred per read. The data readback \nis valid on the falling edge of SCLK.  \nThe default mode of the AD9912 serial control port is bidirec-\ntional mode, and the data readback appears on the SDIO pin. It is possible to set the AD9912 to unidirectional mode by writing \nto the SDO active bit (Register 0x0000, Bit 0 = 1), and in that \nmode, the requested data appears on the SDO pin.  \nBy default, a read request reads the register value that is cur-\nrently in use by the AD9912. However, setting Register 0x0004, Bit 0 = 1 causes the buffered registers to be read instead. The buffered registers are the ones that take effect during the next \nI/O update. \n06763-042AD9912\nCOREUPDATE\nREGISTERS\nTOGGLE\nIO_UPDATE\nPINSCLK\nSDIO\nSDO\nCSB\nSERIAL\nCONTROL\nPORT\nCONTROL REGISTERSREGISTER BUFFERS\n \nFigure 50. Relationship Between Serial  Control Port Register Buffers and \nControl Registers of the AD9912 \nThe AD9912 uses Register 0x0000 to Register 0x0509. Although \nthe AD9912 serial control port allows both 8-bit and 16-bit instructions, the 8-bit instruction mode provides access to five address bits (A4 to A0) only, which restricts its use to Address \nSpace 0x00 to Address Space 0x31. The AD9912 defaults to 16-bit \ninstruction mode on power-up, and the 8-bit instruction mode \nis not supported. \nTHE INSTRUCTION WORD (16 BITS) \nThe MSB of the instruction word is R/ W, which indicates \nwhether the instruction is a read or a write. The next two bits, \n[W1:W0], are the transfer length in bytes. The final 13 bits are the address ([A12:A0]) at which to begin the read or write \noperation.  \nFor a write, the instruction word is followed by the number of \nbytes of data indicated by Bits[W1:W0], which is interpreted according to Table 9 . Bits[A12:A0] select the address within the register map that is written to or read from during the data transfer portion of the communications cycle. The AD9912 uses all of the 13-bit address space. For multibyte transfers, this address is the starting byte address.  \nTable 9. Byte Transfer Count \nW1 W0 Bytes to Transfer  \n(Excluding the 2-Byte Instruction) \n0 0 1 \n0 1 2 \n1 0 3 \n1 1 Streaming mode \nMSB/LSB FIRST TRANSFERS \nThe AD9912 instruction word and byte data can be MSB first or \nLSB first. The default for the AD9912 is MSB first. The LSB first \nmode can be enabled by writing a 1 to the LSB first bit in the serial configuration register and then issuing an I/O update. Immediately after the LSB first bit is set, all serial control port operations are changed to LSB first order. \nWhen MSB first mode is active, the instruction and data bytes \nmust be written from MSB to LSB. Multibyte data transfers in \nMSB first format start with an instruction byte that includes the register address of the most significant data byte. Subsequent data bytes must follow in order from high address to low address. In MSB first mode, the serial control port internal address \ngenerator decrements for each data byte of the multibyte \ntransfer cycle.  \nWhen LSB first = 1 (LSB first), the instruction and data bytes \nmust be written from LSB to MSB. Multibyte data transfers in LSB first format start with an instruction byte that includes the register address of the least significant data byte followed by multiple data bytes. The serial control port internal byte address generator increments for each byte of the multibyte transfer cycle. \nThe AD9912 serial control port register address decrements from \nthe register address just written toward 0x0000 for multibyte \nI/O operations if the MSB first mode is active (default). If the LSB first mode is active, the serial control port register address increments from the address just written toward 0x1FFF for \nmultibyte I/O operations. \nUnused addresses are not skipped during multibyte I/O operations. \nThe user should write the default value to a reserved register and \nshould write only zeros to unmapped registers. Note that it is \nmore efficient to issue a new write command than to write the default value to more than two consecutive reserved (or \nunmapped) registers. \n  AD9912\n \nRev.
