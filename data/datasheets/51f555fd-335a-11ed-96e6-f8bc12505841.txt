#### Description:
The IHLP4040DZER2R2M01 is a high-performance shielded inductor from Vishay's IHLP series, designed for applications requiring high saturation current and low DC resistance. It is a surface-mount device (SMD) that provides efficient energy storage and filtering in power management circuits.

#### Typical Applications:
- Power management in portable devices such as PDAs, notebooks, desktops, and servers.
- High current Point of Load (POL) converters.
- Low-profile, high-current power supplies.
- Battery-powered devices.
- DC/DC converters in distributed power systems.
- DC/DC converters for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

This inductor is particularly suited for applications where space is limited and high efficiency is required, making it ideal for modern electronic devices that demand compact and reliable power solutions.
