The zero\ndelay is achieved  by aligning the phase between the incoming clock and\nthe output clock, operable within the range of 10 to 133MHz.\nThe IDT23S05 is an 8-pin version of the IDT23S09. IDT23S05 accepts\none reference input, and drives out five low skew clocks. The -1H version\nof this device operates up to 133MHz frequency and has a higher drive than\nthe -1 device. All parts have on-chip PLLs which lock to an input clock on\nthe REF pin. The PLL feedback is on-chip and is obtained from the CLKOUT\npad. In the absence of an input clock, the IDT23S05 enters power down.\nIn this mode, the device will draw less than 12 µA for Commercial Tempera-\nture range and less than 25µA for Industrial temperature range ,  the outputs\nare tri-stated, and the PLL is not running, resulting in a significant reduction\nof power.\nThe IDT23S05 is characterized for both Industrial and Commercial\noperation.\n\n2COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGESIDT23S05\n3.3V ZERO DELAY CLOCK BUFFER, SPREAD SPECTRUM\nREF\nCLK12\n3\n48\n7\n6\n51\nCLK2\nGNDCLKOUT\nCLK4\nVDD\nCLK3PIN CONFIGURA TION\nSOIC\nTOP VIEWSymbol Rating Max.

Since the CLKOUT pin is the internal feedback for the PLL, its relative\nloading can affect and adjust the input/output delay.\nFor designs utilizing zero I/O Delay, all outputs including CLKOUT must be equally loaded. Even if the output is not used, it must have a capacitive\nload  equal to that on the other outputs in order to obtain true zero I/O Delay. If I/O Delay adjustments are needed, use the Output Load Difference diagram\nto calculate loading differences between the CLKOUT pin and other outputs. For zero output-to-output skew, all outputs must be loaded equally.\nSPREAD SPECTR UM COMP ATIBLE\nMany systems being designed now use a technology called Spread Spectrum Frequency Timing Generation.  This product is designed not to filter\noff the Spread Spectrum feature of the reference input, assuming it exists.  When a zero delay buffer is not designed to pass the Spread Spectrum feature\nthrough, the result is a significant amount of tracking skew, which may cause problems in systems requiring synchronization.\n7COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGESIDT23S05\n3.3V ZERO DELAY CLOCK BUFFER, SPREAD SPECTRUM\nVDD\nOUTPUTS\nVDD\nGND GND0.1µF0.1µFVDD\nOUTPUTS\n10pF\nVDD\nGND GND0.1µF0.1µF\n1K Ω1K Ω\nCLOAD CLK OUT CLK OUTOutput1.4V\n1.4V\nt5Output\nREFVDD/2\nt6Output\nCLK OUT\nDevice 1 \nt7CLK OUT\nDevice 2 VDD/2\nVDD/2\nVDD/21.4V 1.4Vt2t1\n1.4V\n2V 0.8V\nt3 t40.8V3.3V\n0V2VOutput\nAll Outputs Rise/Fall Time Input to Output Propagation Delay\nDevice to Device SkewOutput to Output Skew Duty Cycle TimingSWIT CHING WAVEFORMS\nTest Circuit 1 (all Parameters Except t8) Test Circuit 2 (t8, Output Slew Rate On -1H Devices)TEST CIRCUITS\n8COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGESIDT23S05\n3.3V ZERO DELAY CLOCK BUFFER, SPREAD SPECTRUM\nMIN MAX MIN MAX \nA 1.35 1.75 .0532 .0688 \nA1 0.10 0.25 .0040 .0098 \nB 0.33 0.51 .013 .020 \nC 0.19 0.25 .0075 .0098 \nD\nE 3.80 4.00 .1497 .1574 \ne\nH 5.80 6.20 .2284 .2440 \nh 0.25 0.50 .010 .020 \nL 0.40 1.27 .016 .050 \nN\na 0° 8° 0° 8° \nVARIATIONS \nMIN MAX MIN MAX \n8 4.80 5.00 .1890 .1968 1.27 BASIC 0.050 BASIC COMMON DIMENSIONS In Millimeters In Inches \nCOMMON DIMENSIONS \nReference Doc.:  JEDEC Publication 95, MS-012 150 mil (Narrow Body) SOIC \nNSEE VARIATIONS SEE VARIATIONS \nD mm.
