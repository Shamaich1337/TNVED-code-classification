Low \nnoise, e n = 3.5 nV/√Hz, at 10 Hz, a low 1/f noise corner \nfrequency of 2.7 Hz, and high gain (1.8 million), allow acc urate \nhigh-gain amplification of low-level signals. A gain band width \nproduct of 8 MHz and a 2.8 V/µs slew rate provide excel lent \ndynamic accuracy in high speed, data-acquisition syst ems. \nA low input bias current of ±10 nA is achieved by us e of a bias \ncurrent cancellation circuit. Over the military tem perature \nrange, this circuit typically holds I B and I OS  to ±20 nA and 15 nA, \nrespectively. \nThe output stage has good load driving capability. A gu aranteed \nswing of ±10 V into 600 Ω and low output distortion  make the \nOP27  an excellent choice for professional audio applications. \n(Continued on Page 3)  PIN CONFIGURATIONS \nV+ \nOUT \nNC \n4V– (CASE) BAL \nBAL 1 \n–IN 2 \n+IN 3 OP27 \nNC = NO CONNECT \n00317-001  \nFigure 1. 8-Lead TO-99 (J-Suffix) \n8\n7\n6\n51\n2\n3\n4\nNC = NO CONNECT VOS  TRIM \n–IN \n+IN VOS  TRIM \nV+\nOUT \nNC V–OP27 \n00317-002  \nFigure 2. 8-Lead CERDIP – Glass Hermetic Seal (Z-Suf fix),  \n8-Lead PDIP (P-Suffix), and 8-Lead SOIC (S-Suffix) \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM \nVOS  ADJ. \nNONINVERTING \nINPUT (+) \nINVERTING \nINPUT ( –)\nV–V+ \nQ2B R2 1\nQ3 Q2A Q1A Q1B R4 \nR1 1R3 1 8\n.\nR1 AND R2 ARE PERMANENTLY \nADJUSTED AT WAFER TEST FOR \nMINIMUM OFFSET VOLTAGE 1Q6 \nQ21 C2 \nR23 R24 \nQ23 Q24 Q22 \nR5 \nQ11 Q12 \nQ27 Q28 C1 \nR9 \nR12 \nC3 C4 \nQ26 Q20 Q19 Q46 \nQ45 OUTPUT \n00317-003  \nFigure 3.  \n \nOP27 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

H | Page 3 of 21 GENERAL DESCRIPTION \n(Continued from Page 1) \nPSRR and CMRR exceed 120 dB. These characteristics, co upled \nwith long-term drift of 0.2 µV/month, allow the circuit  designer \nto achieve performance levels previously attained o nly by discrete \ndesigns. \nLow cost, high volume production of OP27  is achieved by \nusing an on-chip Zener zap-trimming network. This r eliable \nand stable offset trimming scheme has proven its effec tiveness \nover many years of production history. The OP27  provides excellent performance in low noise, \nhigh accuracy amplification of low level signals. Application s \ninclude stable integrators, precision summing amplifiers, \nprecision voltage threshold detectors, comparators, and \nprofessional audio circuits such as tape heads and microphone \npreamplifiers. \n \nOP27 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

H | Page 14 of 21 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nOP27  series units can be inserted directly into OP07  sockets \nwith or without removal of external compensation or  nulling \ncomponents. OP27  offset voltage can be nulled to 0 (or another \ndesired setting) using a potentiometer (see Figure 35). \nThe OP27  provides stable operation with load capacitances of  \nup to 2000 pF and ±10 V swings; larger capacitances should  be \ndecoupled with a 50 Ω resistor inside the feedback l oop. The \nOP27  is unity-gain stable. \nThermoelectric voltages generated by dissimilar metals a t the \ninput terminal contacts can degrade the drift perfo rmance. \nBest operation is obtained when both input contacts are \nmaintained at the same temperature. \n+–-\nOP27 \nV–V+ \nOUTPUT RP 10k :\n1\n7\n6\n48\n32\n00317-035  \nFigure 35. Offset Nulling Circuit \nOFFSET VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT \nThe input offset voltage of the OP27  is trimmed at wafer level. \nHowever, if further adjustment of V OS  is necessary, a 10 kΩ trim \npotentiometer can be used. TCV OS  is not degraded (see Figure 35). \nOther potentiometer values from 1 kΩ to 1 MΩ can be used \nwith a slight degradation (0.1 µV/°C to 0.2 µV/°C) of TCV OS . \nTrimming to a value other than zero creates a drift  of approxi-\nmately (V OS /300) µV/°C. For example, the change in TCV OS  is \n0.33 µV/°C if V OS  is adjusted to 100 µV . The offset voltage \nadjustment range with a 10 kΩ potentiometer is ±4 m V . If smaller \nadjustment range is required, the nulling sensitivity ca n be \nreduced by using a smaller potentiometer in conjunc tion with \nfixed resistors. For example, Figure 36 shows a network th at has \na ±280 µV adjustment range. \n1 8 4.7k : 4.7k : 1k : POT T\nV+ \n00317-036  \nFigure 36. Offset Voltage Adjustment \n NOISE MEASUREMENTS \nTo measure the 80 nV p-p noise specification of the  OP27  in \nthe 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz range, the following precautions must be \nobserved: \nx The device must be warmed up for at least five minu tes. \nAs shown in the warm-up drift curve, the offset vol tage \ntypically changes 4 µV due to increasing chip tempe rature \nafter power-up. In the 10-second measurement interv al, \nthese temperature-induced effects can exceed tens-of -\nnanovolts. \nx For similar reasons, the device has to be well-shielded \nfrom air currents. Shielding minimizes thermocouple  effects. \nx Sudden motion in the vicinity of the device can als o \nfeedthrough to increase the observed noise. \nx The test time to measure 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz noise shou ld not \nexceed 10 seconds. As shown in the noise-tester fre quency \nresponse curve, the 0.1 Hz corner is defined by only  one \nzero. The test time of 10 seconds acts as an additi onal zero \nto eliminate noise contributions from the frequency  band \nbelow 0.1 Hz. \nx A noise voltage density test is recommended when \nmeasuring noise on a large number of units. A 10 Hz nois e \nvoltage density measurement correlates well with a 0.1 Hz to \n10 Hz p-p noise reading, since both results are dete rmined \nby the white noise and the location of the 1/f corn er \nfrequency. \nUNITY-GAIN BUFFER APPLICATIONS \nWhen R f ≤ 100 Ω and the input is driven with a fast, large  \nsignal pulse (>1 V), the output waveform looks as sho wn in the \npulsed operation diagram (see Figure 37). \nDuring the fast feedthrough-like portion of the out put, the \ninput protection diodes effectively short the outpu t to the input, \nand a current, limited only by the output short-cir cuit protect-\nion, is drawn by the signal generator. With R f ≥ 500 Ω, the output is \ncapable of handling the current requirements (I L ≤ 20 mA at 10 V); \nthe amplifier stays in its active mode and a smooth  transition \noccurs. \nWhen R f > 2 kΩ, a pole is created with R f and the amplifier’s \ninput capacitance (8 pF) that creates additional ph ase shift and \nreduces phase margin. A small capacitor (20 pF to 50 pF) in \nparallel with R f eliminates this problem. \n+–\nOP27 Rf\n2.8V/ Ps\n00317-037  \nFigure 37. Pulsed Operation \nData Sheet OP27 \n \nRev. H | Page 15 of 21 COMMENTS ON NOISE \nThe OP27  is a very low noise, monolithic op amp. The out-\nstanding input voltage noise characteristics of the  OP27  \nare achieved mainly by operating the input stage at  a high \nquiescent current. The input bias and offset curren ts, which \nwould normally increase, are held to reasonable val ues by the \ninput bias current cancellation circuit. The OP27A /OP27E  has \nIB and I OS  of only ±40 nA and 35 nA at 25°C respectively. Thi s \nis particularly important when the input has a high  source \nresistance. In addition, many audio amplifier designers pre fer \nto use direct coupling. The high I B, V OS , and TCV OS  of previous \ndesigns have made direct coupling difficult, if not impossi ble, \nto use. \nVoltage noise is inversely proportional to the squa re root of bias \ncurrent, but current noise is proportional to the s quare root of \nbias current. The noise advantage of the OP27  disappears when \nhigh source resistors are used.

Noise vs. Source Resistance (Including R esistor Noise) at 1000 Hz \nAt R S < 1 kΩ, the low voltage noise of the OP27  is maintained. \nWith R S < 1 kΩ, total noise increases but is dominated by the \nresistor noise rather than current or voltage noise . lt is only \nbeyond R S of 20 kΩ that current noise starts to dominate. Th e \nargument can be made that current noise is not impo rtant for \napplications with low-to-moderate source resistance s. The \ncrossover between the OP27  and OP07  noise occurs in the 15 kΩ \nto 40 kΩ region. Figure 39 shows the 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz p-p noise. Here the picture \nis less favorable; resistor noise is negligible and current noi se \nbecomes important because it is inversely proportio nal to the \nsquare root of frequency. The crossover with the OP07  occurs \nin the 3 kΩ to 5 kΩ range depending on whether bala nced or \nunbalanced source resistors are used (at 3 kΩ the I B and I OS  \nerror also can be 3× the V OS  spec). \nRS—SOURCE RESISTANCE ( :)100 \n50 10k p-p NOISE (nV) 50 \n500 1k 5k 10 1k \n500 \n100 50k RS1 \nRS2     1 RS UNMATCHED \ne.g. RS = RS1  = 10k :, RS2  = 0 \n    2 RS MATCHED \ne.g. RS = 10k :, RS1  = RS2  = 5k :OP07 5534 \nOP27/37 \nREGISTER \nNOISE ONL YOP08/108 \n1\n2\n00317-039  \nFigure 39.

Phono Preamplifier Circuit \nThe OP27  brings a 3.2 nV/√Hz voltage noise and 0.45 pA/√Hz \ncurrent noise to this circuit. To minimize noise fr om other \nsources, R3 is set to a value of 100 Ω, generating a  voltage noise \nof 1.3 nV/√Hz. The noise increases the 3.2 nV/√Hz o f the \namplifier by only 0.7 dB. With a 1 kΩ source, the c ircuit noise \nmeasures 63 dB below a 1 mV reference level, unweig hted, in a \n20 kHz noise bandwidth. \nGain (G) of the circuit at 1 kHz can be calculated by the \nexpression: \n¸¹·¨©§\x0e R3 R1 G 1 101 . 0  \nFor the values shown, the gain is just under 100 (o r 40 dB). \nLower gains can be accommodated by increasing R3, but gai ns \nhigher than 40 dB show more equalization errors bec ause of the \n8 MHz gain bandwidth of the OP27 . \nThis circuit is capable of very low distortion over  its entire \nrange, generally below 0.01% at levels up to 7 V rms. At 3 V  \noutput levels, it produces less than 0.03% total harmonic \ndistortion at frequencies up to 20 kHz. \nCapacitor C3 and Resistor R4 form a simple −6 dB pe r octave \nrumble filter, with a corner at 22 Hz. As an option , the switch \nselected Shunt Capacitor C4, a nonpolarized electroly tic, \nbypasses the low frequency roll-off. Placing the rumble  filter’s \nhigh-pass action after the preamplifier has the des irable result \nof discriminating against the RIAA-amplified low fr equency \nnoise components and pickup produced low frequency \ndisturbances. \nA preamplifier for NAB tape playback is similar to an RIAA \nphono preamplifier, though more gain is typically de manded, \nalong with equalization requiring a heavy low frequency boost. \nThe circuit in Figure 41 can be readily modified fo r tape use, as \nshown by Figure 42. \nData Sheet OP27 \n \nRev.

Tape Head Preamplifier \nWhile the tape equalization requirement has a flat high \nfrequency gain above 3 kHz (T2 = 50 µs), the amplif ier need \nnot be stabilized for unity gain. The decompensated  OP37  \nprovides a greater bandwidth and slew rate. For man y applica-\ntions, the idealized time constants shown can requi re trimming \nof R1 and R2 to optimize frequency response for non ideal tape \nhead performance and other factors (see the Referen ces section). \nThe network values of the configuration yield a 50 dB gain at \n1 kHz, and the dc gain is greater than 70 dB. Thus,  the worst-\ncase output offset is just over 500 mV . A single 0.47 µ F output \ncapacitor can block this level without affecting th e dynamic \nrange. \nThe tape head can be coupled directly to the amplif ier input, \nbecause the worst-case bias current of 80 nA with a  400 mH, \n100 µ inch head (such as the PRB2H7K) is not troubl esome. \nAmplifier bias-current transients that can magnetiz e a head \npresent one potential tape head problem. The OP27  and OP37  \nare free of bias current transients upon power-up or p ower-\ndown. It is always advantageous to control the speed of po wer \nsupply rise and fall to eliminate transients. \nIn addition, the dc resistance of the head should b e carefully \ncontrolled and preferably below 1 kΩ. For this configura tion, \nthe bias current induced offset voltage can be great er than the \n100 pV maximum offset if the head resistance is not sufficiently \ncontrolled. \nA simple, but effective, fixed gain transformerless microphone \npreamp (Figure 43) amplifies differential signals from low \nimpedance microphones by 50 dB and has an input impe dance \nof 2 kΩ. Because of the high working gain of the ci rcuit, an \nOP37  helps to preserve bandwidth, which is 110 kHz. As t he \nOP37  is a decompensated device (minimum stable gain of 5), a \ndummy resistor, R p, may be necessary if the microphone is to be \nunplugged. Otherwise, the 100% feedback from the op en input \ncan cause the amplifier to oscillate. \nCommon-mode input noise rejection will depend upon the \nmatch of the bridge-resistor ratios. Either close toleran ce (0.1%) \ntypes should be used, or R4 should be trimmed for best CMR R. \nAll resistors should be metal film types for best stability and  low \nnoise. \nNoise performance of this circuit is limited more b y the Input \nResistors R1 and R2 than by the op amp, as R1 and R2  each \ngenerate a 4 nV/√Hz noise, while the op amp generat es a \n3.2 nV/√Hz noise. The rms sum of these predominant n oise sources is about 6 nV/√Hz, equivalent to 0.9 µV in a 20 kHz \nnoise bandwidth, or nearly 61 dB below a 1 mV input sign al. \nMeasurements confirm this predicted performance. \nLOW IMPEDANCE \nMICROPHONE INPUT \n\x0b=\x03 \x03\x18\x13\x9f T2\x03\x15\x13\x13\x9f\x0c C1 \n5mF R1 \n\x14N\x9f R3 \n\x16\x14\x19N\x9f R6 \n\x14\x13\x13\x9f \nR4 \n\x16\x14\x19N\x9f R2 \n\x14N\x9f RP\n\x16\x13N\x9f OUTPUT \nR3 \nR1 R4 \nR2 =OP27/ \nOP37 \n+–\nR7 \n\x14\x13N\x9f \n00317-043  \nFigure 43.
