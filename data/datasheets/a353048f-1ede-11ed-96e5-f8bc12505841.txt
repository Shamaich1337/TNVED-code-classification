Two logic inputs control a differential voltage \nbetween the output pins producing a +10 volt One, a          \n-10 volt Zero, and a 0 volt Null.\nThe CMOS/TTL  control inputs are translated to ARINC \nspecified amplitudes using on board band-gap reference.  \nA logic input is provided to control the slope of the differen-\ntial output signal.  Timing is set by on-chip resistor and \ncapacitor and tested to be within ARINC requirements.\nThe HI-8585 has 37.5 ohms in series with each line driver \noutput.  The HI-8586 provides the option to bypass part of \nthe output resistance so that series resistance can be \nused in external protection circuitry .\nThe HI-8585 or the HI-8586 along with the HI-8588 or the \nHi-8591 line receivers offer the smallest options available \nto get on and off the ARINC bus.\nPIN DESCRIPTION T ABLEV+=12V to 15V\nV-=-12V to -15VSLP1.5\nTX0IN\nTX1IN\nGND V-TXAOUTTXBOUTV+ 1\n2\n3\n4  5 6 7 8 \nHOLT INTEGRATED CIRCUITS\nwww.holtic.com\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\nAPPLICA TION INFORMA TION\n  Figure 1 is a block diagram of the line driver .  The +5V and   \n-5V levels are generated internally using a on-chip band-\ngap reference.  Currents for slope control are set by zener \nvoltages across on-chip resistors.\nThe TX0IN and TX1IN inputs receive logic signals from a  \ncontrol transmitter chip such as the HI-6010, HI-3282 or   \nHI-8282. TXAOUT  and TXBOUT  hold each side of the \nARINC bus at Ground until one of the inputs becomes a \nOne.  If for example TX1IN goes high, a charging path is \nenabled to 5V on an “A” side internal capacitor while the \n“B” side is enabled to -5V.  The charging current is se-\nlected by the SLP1.5 pin.  If the SLP1.5 pin is high, the \ncapacitor is nominally charged from 10% to 90% in 1.5µs.  \nIf SLP1.5 is low, the rise and fall times are 10µs.A unity gain buffer receives the internally generated slopes \nand differentially drives the ARINC line.  Current is limited \nby the series output resistors at each pin.  There are no \nfuses at the outputs of the HI-8585 as exists on the \nHi-8382.\nThe HI-8585 has 37.5 ohms in series with each output and \nthe HI-8586 has 2 ohms in series with each output.  The \nHI-8586 is for applications where external series resis-\ntance is required, typically for lightning protection devices.\nBoth the HI-8585 and HI-8586 are built using high-speed \nCMOS technology .  Care should be taken to ensure the \nV+ and V- supplies are locally decoupled and that the \ninput waveforms are free from negative voltage spikes \nwhich may upset the chip’s internal slope control circuitry .\nFigure 2 shows a possible application    \nof the HI-8585/86 interfacing an ARINC \ntransmit channel from the HI-6010.HI-8585, HI-8586\nFUNCTIONAL  DESCRIPTION  \nTXAOUTCURRENT\nCONTROL\n-5V5V\nONE\nNULL\nZERO\nCONTROL\nLOGIC\nTXBOUT\nCURRENT\nCONTROL\n-5V5VSLP1.5ESD\nPROTECTION\nAND\nVOLTAGE\nTRANSLA TIONTX0IN\nTX1IN\nFIGURE 1  -  LINE DRIVER BLOCK DIAGRAMHI-8585 = 37.5 OHMS\nHI-8586 = 2 OHMSHI-8585 = 37.5 OHMS\nHI-8586 = 2 OHMS\nONE\nNULL\nZERO\nCONTROL\nLOGIC“A” SIDE\n“B” SIDE\nGND8\nTXBOUTTXAOUT TX1IN\nTX0INARINC\nChannelRINBRINATEST A\nTESTB{HARDWIRED\nOR\nDRIVEN FROM LOGICROUTBROUT A5V\nVCC\nV-\n-15VSLP1.5\nTXD0TXD1RXD0RXD1\nHI-6010 \n8 BIT  BUS\nARINC\nChannel1\n 2\n 8\n6\n74\n3\n4  5 6\n 7\n 2 3HI-8588\nFIGURE 2  -  APPLICA TION DIAGRAM15V\nV+15\nHI-8585\nHOLT INTEGRA TED CIRCUITS\n2\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nV+ = +12V to +15V , V- = -12V to -15V , T   = Operating Temperature Range (unless otherwise stated) AHI-8585, HI-8586\nNOTE:  Stresses above absolute maximum  \nratings or outside recommended operating \nconditions may cause permanent damage to \nthe device.
