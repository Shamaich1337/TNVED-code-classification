Each gate performs the\nBoolean function Y =  A + B in positive logic.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nxA\nxBxY  \n  \n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Balanced CMOS Push-Pull Outputs\nA balanced output allows the device to sink and source similar currents. The drive capability of this device\nmay create fast edges into light loads so routing and load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing.\nAdditionally, the outputs of this device are capable of driving larger currents than the device can sustain without\nbeing damaged. It is important for the output power of the device to be limited to avoid damage due to\nover-current. The electrical and thermal limits defined in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  must be followed at all\ntimes.\nThe SN74HC7002 can drive a load with a total capacitance less than or equal to the maximum load listed in\nthe Switching Characteristics  connected to a high-impedance CMOS input while still meeting all of the datasheet\nspecifications. Larger capacitive loads can be applied, however it is not recommended to exceed the provided\nload value. If larger capacitive loads are required, it is recommended to add a series resistor between the output\nand the capacitor to limit output current to the values given in the Absolute Maximum Ratings .\n8.3.2 CMOS Schmitt-Trigger Inputs\nStandard CMOS inputs are high impedance and are typically modeled as a resistor from the input to ground in\nparallel with the input capacitance given in the Electrical Characteristics . The worst case resistance is calculated\nwith the maximum input voltage, given in the Absolute Maximum Ratings , and the maximum input leakage\ncurrent, given in the Electrical Characteristics , using ohm\'s law (R = V ÷ I).\nThe Schmitt-trigger input architecture provides hysteresis as defined by ΔVT in the Electrical Characteristics ,\nwhich makes this device extremely tolerant to slow or noisy inputs. While the inputs can be driven much\nslower than standard CMOS inputs, it is still recommended to properly terminate unused inputs. Driving the\ninputs slowly will also increase dynamic current consumption of the device.

TI’s customers are responsible for\ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nIn this application, two 2-input NOR gates are used to create an SR latch as shown in Figure 9-1 . The two\nadditional gates can be used for a second SR latch, individually used for their logic function, or the inputs can be\ngrounded and both channels left unused.\nThis device is used to drive the tamper indicator LED and provide one bit of data to the system controller.\nWhen the tamper switch outputs HIGH, the output Q becomes HIGH. This output remains HIGH until the system\ncontroller addresses the event and sends a HIGH signal to the R input which returns the Q output back to LOW.\n9.2 Typical Application\nSystem\nController\nTamper\nSwitchR\nSQ\nR1\nTamper\nIndicatorR2  \n  \nFigure 9-1. Typical application schematic\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\n9.2.1.1 Power Considerations\nEnsure the desired supply voltage is within the range specified in the Recommended Operating Conditions . The\nsupply voltage sets the device\'s electrical characteristics as described in the Electrical Characteristics .\nThe supply must be capable of sourcing current equal to the total current to be sourced by all outputs of the\nSN74HC7002 plus the maximum supply current, I CC, listed in the Electrical Characteristics . The logic device can\nonly source or sink as much current as it is provided at the supply and ground pins, respectively. Be sure not to\nexceed the maximum total current through GND or V CC listed in the Absolute Maximum Ratings .\nTotal power consumption can be calculated using the information provided in CMOS Power Consumption and\nCpd Calculation .\nThermal increase can be calculated using the information provided in Thermal Characteristics of Standard Linear\nand Logic (SLL) Packages and Devices .\nCAUTION\nThe maximum junction temperature, T J(max) listed in the Absolute Maximum Ratings , is an\nadditional limitation  to prevent damage to the device. Do not violate any values listed in the Absolute\nMaximum Ratings . These limits are provided to prevent damage to the device.SN74HC7002\nSCLS033G – MARCH 1984 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74HC7002\n9.2.1.2 Input Considerations\nInput signals must cross V t-(min) to be considered a logic LOW, and V t+(max) to be considered a logic HIGH. Do\nnot exceed the maximum input voltage range found in the Absolute Maximum Ratings .\nUnused inputs must be terminated to either V CC or ground. These can be directly terminated if the input is\ncompletely unused, or they can be connected with a pull-up or pull-down resistor if the input is to be used\nsometimes, but not always. A pull-up resistor is used for a default state of HIGH, and a pull-down resistor is\nused for a default state of LOW. The resistor size is limited by drive current of the controller, leakage current into\nthe SN74HC7002, as specified in the Electrical Characteristics , and the desired input transition rate. A 10-k Ω\nresistor value is often used due to these factors.\nThe SN74HC7002 has no input signal transition rate requirements because it has Schmitt-trigger inputs.\nAnother benefit to having Schmitt-trigger inputs is the ability to reject noise. Noise with a large enough amplitude\ncan still cause issues. To know how much noise is too much, please refer to the ΔVT(min) in the Electrical\nCharacteristics . This hysteresis value will provide the peak-to-peak limit.\nUnlike what happens with standard CMOS inputs, Schmitt-trigger inputs can be held at any valid value without\ncausing huge increases in power consumption. The typical additional current caused by holding an input at a\nvalue other than V CC or ground is plotted in the Typical Characteristics .\nRefer to Section 8.3  for additional information regarding the inputs for this device.\n9.2.1.3 Output Considerations\nThe positive supply voltage is used to produce the output HIGH voltage. Drawing current from the output will\ndecrease the output voltage as specified by the V OH specification in the Electrical Characteristics . Similarly, the\nground voltage is used to produce the output LOW voltage. Sinking current into the output will increase the\noutput voltage as specified by the V OL specification in the Electrical Characteristics .\nUnused outputs can be left floating. Do not connect outputs directly to V CC or ground.\nRefer to Section 8.3  for additional information regarding the outputs for this device.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n1. Add a decoupling capacitor from V CC to GND. The capacitor needs to be placed physically close to the\ndevice and electrically close to both the V CC and GND pins. An example layout is shown in Section 11 .\n2. Ensure the capacitive load at the output is ≤ 70 pF. This is not a hard limit, however it will ensure\noptimal performance. This can be accomplished by providing short, appropriately sized traces from the\nSN74HC7002 to the receiving device.\n3. Ensure the resistive load at the output is larger than (V CC / IO(max)) Ω. This will ensure that the maximum\noutput current from the Absolute Maximum Ratings  is not violated. Most CMOS inputs have a resistive load\nmeasured in megaohms; much larger than the minimum calculated above.\n4. Thermal issues are rarely a concern for logic gates, however the power consumption and thermal increase\ncan be calculated using the steps provided in the application report, CMOS Power Consumption and Cpd\nCalculation\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nR\nS\nQ\nFigure 9-2.

Each V CC terminal should have a bypass capacitor to prevent power\ndisturbance. A 0.1- μF capacitor is recommended for this device. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass caps\nto reject different frequencies of noise. The 0.1- μF and 1- μF capacitors are commonly used in parallel. The\nbypass capacitor should be installed as close to the power terminal as possible for best results, as shown in\nFigure 11-1 .\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple-input and multiple-channel logic devices inputs must not ever be left floating. In many\ncases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused; for example, when only two inputs of\na triple-input AND gate are used. Such unused input pins must not be left unconnected because the undefined\nvoltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. All unused inputs of digital logic\ndevices must be connected to a logic high or logic low voltage, as defined by the input voltage specifications, to\nprevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular unused input depends on the\nfunction of the device. Generally, the inputs are tied to GND or V CC, whichever makes more sense for the logic\nfunction or is more convenient.\n11.2 Layout Example\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n714\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n81A\n1B\n2A\n2B\n2YGND V CC\n4B\n4A\n3B\n3A\n3Y GNDVCC\n4Y1Y0.1 \x1dF\nUnused \ninputs tied to \nVCCBypass capacitor \nplaced close to the \ndevice\nAvoid 90°  \ncorners for \nsignal linesRecommend GND flood fill for \nimproved signal isolation, noise \nreduction, and thermal dissipation\nUnused \noutput left \nfloating\nFigure 11-1.
