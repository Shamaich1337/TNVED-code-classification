The technology isanalog/digital CMOS. The circuitry requires only a 5 voltsupply.\nThe ARINC bus can be connected directly to the chip. The\ntypical 10 volt differential signal is translated and input to awindow comparator and latch. The comparator levels arejust below the standard 6.5 volt minimum ARINC datathreshold and just above the standard 2.5 volt maximumARINC null threshold.\nThe TESTA and TESTB inputs bypass the analog for\ntesting purposes. Also if TESTAand TESTB are both takenhigh, the analog powers down and the digital outputs tri-state allowing wire-or possibilities.\nPlease refer to the HI-8588-10 for applications where an\nexternal resistance in series with the ARINC inputs isrequired for lightning protection or when the digital outputsneed to be a logic zero rather than open circuit whenTESTAand TESTB are both high.\nSee Holt Application Note AN-300 for more information on\nlightning protection.\n(DS8588 Rev.

The receiver operates off the VCC supply only.The inputs RINAand RINB each have series resistors, typi-cally 35K ohms. They connect to level translators whoseresistance to Ground is typically 10K ohms. Therefore, anyseries resistance added to the inputs will affect the voltagetranslation.\nAfter level translation, the inputs are buffered and become\ninputs to a differential amplifier. The amplitude of the differ-ential signal is compared to levels derived from a divider be-tween VCC and Ground. The nominal settings correspondto a One/Zero amplitude of 6.0V and a Null amplitude of3.3V.The status of the ARINC receiver input is latched. A\nNull input resets the latches and a One or Zero inputsets the latches.\nThe logic at the output is controlled by the test signal\nwhich is generated by the logical OR of the TESTA andTESTB pins. If TESTA and TESTB are both One, thenthe receiver is powered down and the output pins float.The powerdown does not disconnect the internal resis-tors at the ARINC input.\nTXBOUTTXAOUT\nTX0INTX1INARINC\nChannelRINBRINATESTA\nTESTB {HARDWIRE\nOR\nDRIVE FROM LOGICROUTBROUTA5V\nVCC\nV-\n-15VGNDTXD1\nTXD0RXD0RXD1\nHI-6010\n8 BIT BUS\nARINC\nChannel1\n2\n8\n6\n74\n3\n4 56\n7\n3\n2HI-8588\nFIGURE 2 - APPLICATION DIAGRAMAPPLICATION INFORMATION\n15V\nV+85\nHI-8586SLP1.51Figure 2 shows a possible application\nof the HI-8588 interfacing anARINC re-ceive channel to the HI-6010 which inturn interfaces to an 8-bit bus.\nHOLT INTEGRATED CIRCUITS\n2\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nHI-8588\nVoltages referenced to Ground\nSupply voltages\nVCC...................................................7V\nARINC input - pin s3&4\nVoltage at either pin......+120V to -120V\nDC current per input pin.................. ±10mAPower dissipation at 25°C\nplastic DIP............0.7Wceramic DIP..........0.5W\nSolder Temperature (reflow) ..............260°CStorage Temperature ....... -65°C to +150°CABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS RECOMMENDED OPERATING CONDITIONS\nSupply Voltages\nVCC...........................................5V ± 5%\nTemperature Range\nIndustrial Screening........-40°C to +85°CHi-Temp Screening.......-55°C to +125°C\nDC ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nVCC = 5.0V UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED OPERATING TEMPERATURE RANGE,NOTE: Stresses above absolute maximum\nratings or outside recommended operating con-ditions may cause permanent damage to thedevice.
