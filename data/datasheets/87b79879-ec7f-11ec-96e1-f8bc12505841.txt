The LM5145 voltage-mode controller with line feedforward drives external high-\nside and low-side N-channel power switches with robust 7.5-V gate drivers suitable for standard-threshold\nMOSFETs. Adaptively-timed gate drivers with 2.3-A source and 3.5-A sink capability minimize body diode\nconduction during switching transitions, reducing switching losses and improving thermal performance when\ndriving MOSFETs at high input voltage and high frequency. The LM5145 can be powered from the output of the\nswitching regulator or another available source, further improving efficiency.\nA 180° out-of-phase clock output relative to the internal oscillator at SYNCOUT works well for cascaded or multi-\nchannel power supplies to reduce input capacitor ripple current and EMI filter size. Additional features of the\nLM5145 include a configurable soft start, an open-drain power-good monitor for fault reporting and output\nmonitoring, monotonic start-up into prebiased loads, integrated VCC bias supply regulator and bootstrap diode,\nexternal power supply tracking, precision enable input with hysteresis for adjustable line undervoltage lockout\n(UVLO), hiccup-mode overload protection, and thermal shutdown protection with automatic recovery.\nThe LM5145 controller is offered in a 4.5-mm × 3.5-mm thermally enhanced, 20-pin VQFN package with\nadditional spacing for high-voltage pins and wettable flanks for optical inspection of solder joint fillets.www.ti.comLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\n6 Pin Configuration and Functions\nVIN\nRT\nHOSW\nBST\nLO\nPGNDVCCILIMSS/TRK\nCOMP\nEN/UVLO\nFB\nAGND\nPGOODSYNCOUT\nSYNCINNC\nEP\nNC2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n1019\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13\n12Exposed \nPad\n(EP)1\n20 11\nConnect Exposed Pad on bottom to AGND and PGND on the PCB.\nFigure 6-1.

If the EN/UVLO voltage is below 0.4 V, the\ncontroller is in the shutdown mode with all functions disabled. If the EN/UVLO voltage is greater than 0.4 V\nand less than 1.2 V, the regulator is in standby mode with the VCC regulator operational, the SS pin\ngrounded, and no switching at the HO and LO outputs. If the EN/UVLO voltage is above 1.2 V, the SS/TRK\nvoltage can ramp and pulse-width modulated gate-drive signals are delivered to the HO and LO pins. A 10-\nμA current source is enabled when EN/UVLO exceeds 1.2 V and flows through the external UVLO resistor\ndivider to provide hysteresis. Hysteresis can be adjusted by varying the resistance of the external divider.\n2 RT IOscillator frequency adjust pin. The internal oscillator is programmed with a single resistor between RT and\nthe AGND. TI recommends a maximum oscillator frequency of 1 MHz. An RT pin resistor is required even\nwhen using the SYNCIN pin to synchronize to an external clock.\n3 SS/TRK ISoft-start and voltage-tracking pin. An external capacitor and an internal 10-μA current source set the ramp\nrate of the error amplifier reference during start-up. When the SS/TRK pin voltage is less than 0.8 V, the\nSS/TRK voltage controls the noninverting input of the error amp. When the SS/TRK voltage exceeds 0.8 V,\nthe amplifier is controlled by the internal 0.8-V reference. SS/TRK is discharged to ground during standby\nand fault conditions. After start-up, the SS/TRK voltage is clamped 115 mV above the FB pin voltage. If FB\nfalls due to a load fault, SS/TRK is discharged to a level 115 mV above FB to provide a controlled recovery\nwhen the fault is removed. Voltage tracking can be implemented by connecting a low impedance reference\nbetween 0 V and 0.8 V to the SS/TRK pin. The 10-µA SS/TRK charging current flows into the reference and\nproduces a voltage error if the impedance is not low. Connect a minimum capacitance from SS/TRK to\nAGND of 2.2 nF.\n4 COMP OLow impedance output of the internal error amplifier. Connect the loop compensation network between the\nCOMP pin and the FB pin.\n5 FB IFeedback connection to the inverting input of the internal error amplifier. A resistor divider from the output to\nthis pin sets the output voltage level. The regulation threshold at the FB pin is nominally 0.8 V.\n6 AGND P Analog ground. Return for the internal 0.8-V voltage reference and analog circuits.LM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n4 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\nTable 6-1. Pin Functions (continued)\nPIN\nI/O(1)DESCRIPTION\nNO. NAME\n7 SYNCOUT OSynchronization output. Logic output that provides a clock signal that is 180° out-of-phase with the high-side\nFET gate drive. Connect SYNCOUT of the master LM5145 to the SYNCIN pin of a second LM5145 to\noperate two controllers at the same frequency with 180° interleaved high-side FET switch turn-on\ntransitions. Note that the SYNCOUT pin does not provide 180° interleaving when the controller is operating\nfrom an external clock that is different from the free-running frequency set by the RT resistor.\n8 SYNCIN IDual function pin for providing an optional clock input and for enabling diode emulation by the low-side\nMOSFET. Connecting a clock signal to the SYNCIN pin synchronizes switching to the external clock. Diode\nemulation by the low-side MOSFET is disabled when the controller is synchronized to an external clock, and\nnegative inductor current can flow in the low-side MOSFET with light loads. A continuous logic low state at\nthe SYNCIN pin enables diode emulation to prevent reverse current flow in the inductor. Diode emulation\nresults in discontinuous mode operation (DCM) at light loads, which improves efficiency. A logic high state at\nthe SYNCIN pin disables diode emulation producing forced-PWM (FPWM) operation. During soft-start when\nSYNCIN is high or a clock signal is present, the LM5145 operates in diode emulation mode until the output\nis in regulation, then gradually increases the SW zero-cross threshold, resulting in a gradual transition from\nDCM to FPWM.\n9 NC — No electrical connection.\n10 PGOOD OPower Good indicator. This pin is an open-drain output. A high state indicates that the voltage at the FB pin\nis within a specified tolerance window centered at 0.8 V.\n11 ILIM ICurrent limit adjust and current sense comparator input. A current sourced from the ILIM pin through an\nexternal resistor programs the threshold voltage for valley current limiting. The opposite end of the threshold\nadjust resistor can be connected to either the drain of the low-side MOSFET for R DS(on)  sensing or to a\ncurrent sense resistor connected to the source of the low-side FET.\n12 PGND PPower ground return pin for the low-side MOSFET gate driver. Connect directly to the source of the low-side\nMOSFET or the ground side of a shunt resistor.\n13 LO PLow-side MOSFET gate drive output. Connect to the gate of the low-side synchronous rectifier FET through\na short, low inductance path.\n14 VCC OOutput of the 7.5-V bias regulator. Locally decouple to PGND using a low ESR/ESL capacitor located as\nclose as possible to the controller. Controller bias can be supplied from an external supply that is greater\nthan the internal VCC regulation voltage. Use caution when applying external bias to ensure that the applied\nvoltage is not greater than the minimum VIN voltage and does not exceed the VCC pin maximum operating\nrating, see Section 7.3 .\n15 EP — Pin internally connected to exposed pad of the package. Electrically isolated.\n16 NC — No electrical connection.\n17 BST OBootstrap supply for the high-side gate driver. Connect to the bootstrap (boot) capacitor. The bootstrap\ncapacitor supplies current to the high-side FET gate and must be placed as close as possible to controller. If\nan external bootstrap diode is used to reduce the time required to charge the bootstrap capacitor, connect\nthe cathode of the diode to the BST pin and anode to VCC.\n18 HO PHigh-side MOSFET gate drive output. Connect to the gate of the high-side MOSFET through a short, low\ninductance path.\n19 SW PSwitching node of the buck controller. Connect to the bootstrap capacitor, the source terminal of the high-\nside MOSFET and the drain terminal of the low-side MOSFET using short, low inductance paths.\n20 VIN P Supply voltage input for the VCC LDO regulator.\n— EP —Exposed pad of the package. Electrically isolated. Solder to the system ground plane to reduce thermal\nresistance.\n(1) P = Power, G = Ground, I = Input, O = Output.\n6.1 Wettable Flanks\n100% automated visual inspection (AVI) post-assembly is typically required to meet requirements for high\nreliability and robustness. Standard quad-flat no-lead (VQFN) packages do not have solderable or exposed pins\nand terminals that are easily viewed. It is therefore difficult to visually determine whether or not the package is\nsuccessfully soldered onto the printed-circuit board (PCB). The wettable-flank process was developed to resolve\nthe issue of side-lead wetting of leadless packaging. The LM5145  is assembled using a 20-pin VQFN package\nwith wettable flanks to provide a visual indicator of solderability, which reduces the inspection time and\nmanufacturing costs.www.ti.comLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 5\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\n7 Specifications\n7.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings\nOver the recommended operating junction temperature range of –40°C to 125°C (unless otherwise noted).(1)\nMIN MAX UNIT\nInput voltagesVIN –0.3 105 V\nSW –1 105\nSW (20-ns transient) –5 105\nILIM –1 105\nEN/UVLO –0.3 105\nVCC –0.3 14\nFB, COMP, SS/TRK, RT –0.3 6\nSYNCIN –0.3 14\nOutput voltagesBST –0.3 115 V\nBST to VCC 105\nBST to SW –0.3 14\nVCC to BST (20-ns transient) 7\nLO (20-ns transient) –3\nPGOOD –0.3 14\nOperating junction temperature, T J 150 °C\nStorage temperature, T stg –55 150 °C\n(1) Stresses beyond those listed under Section 7.1  may cause permanent damage to the device.

The output voltage range is from 0.8 V to 60 V . The voltage-mode control\narchitecture uses input feedforward for excellent line transient response over a wide V IN range. Voltage-mode\ncontrol supports the wide duty cycle range for high input voltage and low dropout applications as well as when a\nhigh voltage conversion ratio (for example, 10-to-1) is required. Current sensing for cycle-by-cycle current limit\ncan be implemented with either the low-side FET R DS(on)  or a current sense resistor. The operating frequency is\nprogrammable from 100 kHz to 1 MHz. The LM5145  drives external high-side and low-side NMOS power\nswitches with robust 7.5-V gate drivers suitable for standard threshold MOSFETs. Adaptive dead-time control\nbetween the high-side and low-side drivers minimizes body diode conduction during switching transitions. An\nexternal bias supply can be connected to the VCC pin to improve efficiency in high-voltage applications. A user-\nselectable diode emulation feature enables DCM operation for improved efficiency and lower dissipation at light-\nload conditions.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVIN VCC\nBST\nPGND\nAGNDILIMSW\nERROR \nAMPVCC\nUVLO7.5 V LDO \nREGULATOR\nHO\nLORT\nSS/TRKCOMPPWM\nCOMPARATOR\n0.8 VTHERMAL\nSHUTDOWNENABLE \nLOGIC\nOSCILLATOR & \nFEEDFORWARD \nRAMP\nGENERATOREN/UVLO0.4 V\nHYSTERESIS 1.2 V STANDBYSHUTDOWN\nCLK\nSYNCOUT\n kFF*VINVCC ENABLE\nPWM\nLOGICSYNCIN\nSUPERVISORY \nCOMPARATORS\nPGOOD0.8 V + 8%\nFBVCC\n+ \nCURRENT LIMIT \nCOMPARATOR++\n±\n+\n±+\n±7.5 V\nFPWM\nILIMLEVEL\nSHIFT\nADAPTIVE\nDEADTIME \nDELAY\n+\nCOMP\nCLAMP \nMODULATOR\nLO\n+\n+ 0.8 V - 8%25 µs \ndelay5 µs\nFILTER\nSTANDBYPEAK \nDETECT \nFILTER\nLOOCP+\n+±\n+115 mVFBRAMPkFF*VIN + 0.3 V\n0.3 VBST_UV\nVSW +\nVBST-UV++\nQCLD R³1´VVCC-UV\nDRIVERDRIVER\nRDS(on) or\nShunt SensingHICCUP \nCOUNTERSCLK±\n±\n±\n±\n±±±±\n±+\nCLAMPZERO CROSS \nDETECTIONLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Input Range (V IN)\nThe LM5145  operational input voltage range is from 6 V  to 75 V . The device is intended for step-down\nconversions from 12-V, 24-V, 48-V, 60-V, and 72-V unregulated, semiregulated, and fully-regulated supply rails.\nThe application circuit in Figure 8-1  shows all the necessary components to implement an LM5145 -based wide-\nVIN step-down regulator using a single supply. The LM5145  uses an internal LDO subregulator to provide a 7.5-\nV VCC bias rail for the gate drive and control circuits (assuming the input voltage is higher than 7.5 V plus the\nnecessary subregulator dropout specification).\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n10 1117\n18\n19\n1420\nBST\nHO\nSW\nLO\nPGNDRT\nSS/TRK\nCOMP\nFB\nAGNDVIN\nVOUT\nLM5145VOUT\nSYNCGND\nPG12SYNCOUT\n8SYNCIN\n9NCEN/UVLO VIN\nILIM PGOODSYNC \nout\n13VCC16\n15NC\nEPLF\nCOUTQ1\nQ2\nCIN\nRILIMCVCCCBST\nCSSRUV2 RUV1\nRFB2RFB1RC2\nCC2CC1RC1CC3\nRPGoptionalRRT\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments IncorporatedCILIM\nFigure 8-1. Schematic Diagram for VIN Operating Range of 6 V to 75 V\nIn high voltage applications, take extra care to ensure the VIN pin does not exceed the absolute maximum\nvoltage rating of 105 V during line or load transient events. Voltage ringing on the VIN pin that exceeds the\nSection 7.1 can damage the IC. Use high-quality ceramic input capacitors to minimize ringing. An RC filter from\nthe input rail to the VIN pin (for example, 4.7 Ω and 0.1 µF) provides supplementary filtering at the VIN pin.\n8.3.2 Output Voltage Setpoint and Accuracy (FB)\nThe reference voltage at the FB pin is set at 0.8 V with a feedback system accuracy over the full junction\ntemperature range of ±1%. Junction temperature range for the device is –40°C to +125°C . While dependent on\nswitching frequency and load current levels, the LM5145  is generally capable of providing output voltages in the\nrange of 0.8 V to a maximum of 60 V or slightly less than V IN , whichever is lower. The DC output voltage\nsetpoint during normal operation is set by the feedback resistor network, R FB1 and R FB2, connected to the\noutput.\n8.3.3 High-Voltage Bias Supply Regulator (VCC)\nThe LM5145  contains an internal high-voltage VCC regulator that provides a bias supply for the PWM controller\nand its gate drivers for the external MOSFETs. The input pin (VIN) can be connected directly to an input voltage\nsource up to 75 V. The output of the VCC regulator is set to 7.5 V. However, when the input voltage is below the\nVCC setpoint level, the VCC output tracks V IN with a small voltage drop. Connect a ceramic decoupling\ncapacitor between 1 µF and 5 µF from VCC to AGND for stability.www.ti.comLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\nThe VCC regulator output has a current limit of 40 mA (minimum). At power up, the regulator sources current\ninto the capacitor connected to the VCC pin. When the VCC voltage exceeds its rising UVLO threshold of 4.93 V,\nthe output is enabled (if EN/UVLO is above 1.2 V), and the soft-start sequence begins. The output remains\nactive until the VCC voltage falls below its falling UVLO threshold of 4.67 V (typical) or if EN/UVLO goes to a\nstandby or shutdown state.\nInternal power dissipation of the VCC regulator can be minimized by connecting the output voltage or an\nauxiliary bias supply rail (up to 13 V) to VCC using a diode D VCC as shown in Figure 8-2 . A diode in series with\nthe input prevents reverse current flow from VCC to VIN if the input voltage falls below the external VCC rail.\n20 VCCLM5145\n14 VIN VCC-EXTRequired if V IN < V CC(EXT)\n6\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments IncorporatedCVIN\n0.1 PFDVIN\nVIN\nCVCC\n2.2 PFDVCC\n8 V to 13 V\nAGND6 V to 75 V\nFigure 8-2. VCC Bias Supply Connection From VOUT or Auxiliary Supply\nNote that a finite bias supply regulator dropout voltage exists and is manifested to a larger extent when driving\nhigh gate charge (Q G) power MOSFETs at elevated switching frequencies. For example, at V VIN = 6 V, the VCC\nvoltage is 5.8 V with a DC operating current, I VCC, of 20 mA. Such a low gate drive voltage may be insufficient to\nfully enhance the power MOSFETs. At the very least, MOSFET on-state resistance, R DS(ON) , can increase at\nsuch low gate drive voltage.\nHere are the main considerations when operating at input voltages below 7.5 V:\n• Increased MOSFET R DS(on)  at lower V GS, leading to Increased conduction losses and reduced OCP setpoint.\n• Increased switching losses given the slower switching times when operating at lower gate voltages.\n• Restricted range of suitable power MOSFETs to choose from (MOSFETs with R DS(on)  rated at V GS = 4.5 V\nbecome mandatory).\n8.3.4 Precision Enable (EN/UVLO)\nThe EN/UVLO input supports adjustable input undervoltage lockout (UVLO) with hysteresis programmed by the\nresistor values for application specific power-up and power-down requirements. EN/UVLO connects to a\ncomparator-based input referenced to a 1.2-V bandgap voltage. An external logic signal can be used to drive the\nEN/UVLO input to toggle the output ON and OFF and for system sequencing or protection. The simplest way to\nenable the operation of the LM5145  is to connect EN/UVLO directly to VIN. This allows self start-up of the\nLM5145  when V CC is within its valid operating range. However, many applications benefit from using a resistor\ndivider R UV1 and R UV2 as shown in Figure 8-3  to establish a precision UVLO level.\nUse Equation 1  and Equation 2  to calculate the UVLO resistors given the required input turnon and turnoff\nvoltages.\nIN(on) IN(off)\nUV1\nHYSV V \nRI\x10\n \n(1)\nEN\nUV2 UV1\nIN(on) ENVR R V V  \x98 \x10\n(2)LM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\nVIN\n1.2V Enable \nComparatorRUV1\nRUV2LM5145\n1EN/UVLO\nRemote \nShutdown10 \x1dAvcc\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFigure 8-3.

The LM5145 operates in standby mode when the EN/UVLO voltage is between the hard shutdown and\nprecision enable (standby) thresholds.\n8.3.5 Power Good Monitor (PGOOD)\nThe LM5145  provides a PGOOD flag pin to indicate when the output voltage is within a regulation window. Use\nthe PGOOD signal as shown in Figure 8-4  for start-up sequencing of downstream converters, fault protection,\nand output monitoring. PGOOD is an open-drain output that requires a pullup resistor to a DC supply not greater\nthan 13 V. The typical range of pullup resistance is 10 k Ω to 100 k Ω. If necessary, use a resistor divider to\ndecrease the voltage from a higher voltage pullup rail.\n5 FBLM5145\n1EN/UVLORUV1\n499 k\rVOUT(MASTER)  = 5 V\nRFB1\nRFB220 k\r\n3.83 k\r0.8 V 5 FBLM5145\n1RPG\n20 k\rRFB3\nRFB420 k\r\n6.34 k\r0.8 VVOUT(SLAVE)  = 3.3 VVIN(on) = 15 V\nVIN(off) = 10 V\nRegulator #1\nStart-up based on \nInput Voltage UVLO Regulator #2 \nSequential Start-up \nbased on PGOODPGOOD 10 PGOOD 10\nRUV2\n43.2 k\rEN/UVLO\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-4. Master-Slave Sequencing Implementation Using PGOOD and EN/UVLO\nWhen the FB voltage exceeds 94% of the internal reference V REF, the internal PGOOD switch turns off and\nPGOOD can be pulled high by the external pullup. If the FB voltage falls below 92% of V REF, the internal\nPGOOD switch turns on, and PGOOD is pulled low to indicate that the output voltage is out of regulation.\nSimilarly, when the FB voltage exceeds 108% of V REF, the internal PGOOD switch turns on, pulling PGOOD low.\nIf the FB voltage subsequently falls below 105% of V REF, the PGOOD switch is turned off and PGOOD is pulled\nhigh. PGOOD has a built-in deglitch delay of 25 µs.\n8.3.6 Switching Frequency (RT, SYNCIN)\nThere are two options for setting the switching frequency, F SW, of the LM5145 , thus providing a power supply\ndesigner with a level of flexibility when choosing external components for various applications.

The LM5145 features an adjustable soft start (set by a capacitor\nfrom the SS/TRK pin to GND) that determines the charging time of the output. A 10-µA current source charges\nthis soft-start capacitor. Soft start limits inrush current as a result of high output capacitance to avoid an\novercurrent condition. Stress on the input supply rail is also reduced. The soft-start time, t SS, for the output\nvoltage to ramp to its nominal level is set by Equation 4 .\nSS REF\nSS\nSSC V tI\x98 \n(4)\nwhere\n• C SS is the soft-start capacitance\n• V REF is the 0.8-V reference\n• I SS is the 10-µA current sourced from the SS/TRK pin\nMore simply, calculate C SS using Equation 5 .\nSS SSC nF 12.5 t ms  \x98 ª º ª º¬ ¼ ¬ ¼\n(5)\nThe SS/TRK pin is internally clamped to V FB + 115 mV to allow a soft-start recovery from an overload event. The\nclamp circuit requires a soft-start capacitance greater than 2 nF for stability and has a current limit of\napproximately 2 mA.\n8.3.7.1 Tracking\nThe SS/TRK pin also doubles as a tracking pin when master-slave power-supply tracking is required. This\ntracking is achieved by simply dividing down the output voltage of the master with a simple resistor network.\nCoincident, ratiometric, and offset tracking modes are possible.\nIf an external voltage source is connected to the SS/TRK pin, the external soft-start capability of the LM5145  is\neffectively disabled. The regulated output voltage level is reached when the SS/TRACK pin reaches the 0.8-V\nreference voltage level. It is the responsibility of the system designer to determine if an external soft-start\ncapacitor is required to keep the device from entering current limit during a start-up event. Likewise, the system\ndesigner must also be aware of how fast the input supply ramps if the tracking feature is enabled.\nPGOOD \n2V/DIVVOUT 1V/DIVSS/TRK\n160mV/DIV\n94% VOUT92% VOUT\n10 ms/DIV\nFigure 8-6.

As expected, the PGOOD flag transitions at thresholds of 94% (rising) and\n92% (falling) of the nominal output voltage setpoint.\nTwo practical tracking configurations, ratiometric and coincident, are shown in Figure 8-7 . The most common\napplication is coincident tracking, used in core versus I/O voltage tracking in DSP and FPGA implementations.\nCoincident tracking forces the master and slave channels to have the same output voltage ramp rate until the\nslave output reaches its regulated setpoint. Conversely, ratiometric tracking sets the output voltage of the slave\nto a fraction of the output voltage of the master during start-up.\n5 FBLM5145\n3SS/TRKRTRK1\nRTRK226.7 k\r\n10 k\rVOUT SLAVE1  = 1.8 V\nRFB1\nRFB212.5 k\r\n10 k\r0.8 V 5 FBLM5145\n3SS/TRKRTRK3\nRTRK4\n20 k\rRFB3\nRFB410 k\r\n20 k\r0.8 VVOUT SLAVE2  = 1.2 VVOUT MASTER  = 3.3 V\nSlave Regulator #1 \nRatiometric TrackingSlave Regulator #2 \nCoincident Tracking\n8SYNCIN\nSYNCOUT\nfrom MasterCSS1\n2.2 nFCSS2\n2.2 nF\n8SYNCIN10 k\r\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-7. Tracking Implementation With Master, Ratiometric Slave, and Coincident Slave Rails\nFor coincident tracking, connect the SS/TRK input of the slave regulator to a resistor divider from the output\nvoltage of the master that is the same as the divider used on the FB pin of the slave. In other words, simply\nselect R TRK3 = R FB3 and R TRK4 = R FB4 as shown in Figure 8-7 . As the master voltage rises, the slave voltage\nrises identically (aside from the 80-mV offset from SS/TRK to FB when V FB is below 0.8 V). Eventually, the slave\nvoltage reaches its regulation voltage, at which point the internal reference takes over the regulation while the\nSS/TRK input continues to 115 mV above FB, and no longer controls the output voltage.\nIn all cases, to ensure that the output voltage accuracy is not compromised by the SS/TRK voltage being too\nclose to the 0.8-V reference voltage, the final value of the SS/TRK voltage of the slave should be at least 100\nmV above FB.\n8.3.8 Voltage-Mode Control (COMP)\nThe LM5145  incorporates a voltage-mode control loop implementation with input voltage feedforward to\neliminate the input voltage dependence of the PWM modulator gain. This configuration allows the controller to\nmaintain stability throughout the entire input voltage operating range and provides for optimal response to input\nvoltage transient disturbances. The constant gain provided by the controller greatly simplifies loop compensation\ndesign because the loop characteristics remain constant as the input voltage changes, unlike a buck converter\nwithout voltage feedforward. An increase in input voltage is matched by a concomitant increase in ramp voltage\namplitude to maintain constant modulator gain. The input voltage feedforward gain, k FF, is 15, equivalent to the\ninput voltage divided by the ramp amplitude, V IN/VRAMP . See Section 9.1.3  for more detail.\n8.3.9 Gate Drivers (LO, HO)\nThe LM5145  gate driver impedances are low enough to perform effectively in high output current applications\nwhere large die-size or paralleled MOSFETs with correspondingly large gate charge, Q G, are used. Measured at\nVVCC = 7.5 V, the low-side driver of the LM5145  has a low impedance pulldown path of 0.9 Ω to minimize the\neffect of dv/dt induced turn-on, particularly with low gate-threshold voltage MOSFETs. Similarly, the high-sideLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\ndriver has 1.5- Ω and 0.9- Ω pullup and pulldown impedances, respectively, for faster switching transition times,\nlower switching loss, and greater efficiency.\nThe high-side gate driver works in conjunction with an integrated bootstrap diode and external bootstrap\ncapacitor, C BST. When the low-side MOSFET conducts, the SW voltage is approximately at 0 V and C BST is\ncharged from VCC through the integrated boot diode. Connect a 0.1- μF or larger ceramic capacitor close to the\nBST and SW pins.\nFurthermore, there is a proprietary adaptive dead-time control on both switching edges to prevent shoot-through\nand cross-conduction, minimize body diode conduction time, and reduce body diode reverse recovery losses.\n8.3.10 Current Sensing and Overcurrent Protection (ILIM)\nThe LM5145  implements a lossless current sense scheme designed to limit the inductor current during an\noverload or short-circuit condition. Figure 8-8  portrays the popular current sense method using the on-state\nresistance of the low-side MOSFET. Meanwhile, Figure 8-9  shows an alternative implementation with current\nshunt resistor, R S. The LM5145 senses the inductor current during the PWM off-time (when LO is high).\nVIN\nVOUT\nGNDLF\nRILIM\nILIM\nCOUT\nQ2Q1\nSW\nLOHO\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-8.

Shunt Resistor Current Sensing\nThe ILIM pin of the LM5145  sources a reference current that flows in an external resistor, designated R ILIM, to\nprogram of the current limit threshold. A current limit comparator on the ILIM pin prevents further SW pulses if\nthe ILIM pin voltage goes below GND. Figure 8-10  shows the implementation.\nResistor R ILIM is tied to SW to use the R DS(on)  of the low-side MOSFET as a sensing element (termed R DS(on)\nmode). Alternatively, R ILIM is tied to a shunt resistor connected at the source of the low-side MOSFET (termed\nRSENSE  mode). The LM5145 detects the appropriate mode at start-up and sets the source current amplitude and\ntemperature coefficient (TC) accordingly.\nThe ILIM current with R DS-ON  sensing is 200 µA at 27°C junction temperature and incorporates a TC of +4500\nppm/°C to generally track the R DS(on)  temperature variation of the low-side MOSFET. Conversely, the ILIM\ncurrent is a constant 100 µA in R SENSE  mode. This controls the valley of the inductor current during a steady-\nstate overload at the output.

OCP Duty Cycle Limiting Waveforms\nIn addition to valley current limiting, the LM5145  uses a proprietary duty-cycle limiter circuit to reduce the PWM\non-time during an overcurrent condition. As shown in Figure 8-10 , an auxiliary PWM comparator along with a\nmodulated CLAMP voltage limits how quickly the on-time increases in response to a large step in the COMP\nvoltage that typically occurs with a voltage-mode control loop architecture.\nAs depicted in Figure 8-11 , the CLAMP voltage, V CLAMP , is normally regulated above the COMP voltage to\nprovide adequate headroom during a response to a load-on transient. If the COMP voltage rises quickly during\nan overloaded or shorted output condition, the on-time pulse terminates thereby limiting the on-time and peak\ninductor current. Moreover, the CLAMP voltage is reduced if additional valley current limit events occur, further\nreducing the average output current. If the overcurrent condition exists for 128 continuous clock cycles, a hiccup\nevent is triggered and SS is pulled low for 8192 clock cycles before a soft-start sequence is initiated.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Shutdown Mode\nThe EN/UVLO pin provides ON / OFF control for the LM5145 . When the EN/UVLO voltage is below 0.37 V\n(typical), the device is in shutdown mode. Both the internal bias supply LDO and the switching regulator are off.\nThe quiescent current in shutdown mode drops to 13.5 μA (typical) at V IN = 48 V . The LM5145  also includes\nundervoltage protection of the internal bias LDO. If the internal bias supply voltage is below its UVLO threshold\nlevel, the switching regulator remains off.\n8.4.2 Standby Mode\nThe internal bias supply LDO has a lower enable threshold than the switching regulator. When the EN/UVLO\nvoltage exceeds 0.42 V (typical) and is below the precision enable threshold (1.2 V typically), the internal LDO is\non and regulating. Switching action and output voltage regulation are disabled in standby mode.\n8.4.3 Active Mode\nThe LM5145  is in active mode when the VCC voltage is above its rising UVLO threshold of 5 V and the EN/\nUVLO voltage is above the precision EN threshold of 1.2 V. The simplest way to enable the LM5145 is to tie EN/\nUVLO to VIN. This allows self start-up of the LM5145  when the input voltage exceeds the VCC threshold plus\nthe LDO dropout voltage from VIN to VCC.www.ti.comLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\n8.4.4 Diode Emulation Mode\nThe LM5145 provides a diode emulation feature that can be enabled to prevent reverse (drain-to-source) current\nflow in the low-side MOSFET. When configured for diode emulation, the low-side MOSFET is switched off when\nreverse current flow is detected by sensing of the SW voltage using a zero-cross comparator. The benefit of this\nconfiguration is lower power loss at no-load and light-load conditions, the disadvantage being slower light-load\ntransient response.\nThe diode emulation feature is configured with the SYNCIN pin. To enable diode emulation and thus achieve\ndiscontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation at light loads, connect the SYNCIN pin to AGND or leave\nSYNCIN floating. If forced PWM (FPWM) continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation is desired, tie SYNCIN\nto VCC either directly or using a pullup resistor. Note that diode emulation mode is automatically engaged to\nprevent reverse current flow during a prebias start-up. A gradual change from DCM to CCM operation provides\nmonotonic start-up performance.\n8.4.5 Thermal Shutdown\nThe LM5145  includes an internal junction temperature monitor. If the temperature exceeds 175°C (typical),\nthermal shutdown occurs. When entering thermal shutdown, the device:\n1. Turns off the high-side and low-side MOSFETs.\n2. Pulls SS/TRK and PGOOD low.\n3. Turns off the VCC regulator.\n4. Initiates a soft-start sequence when the die temperature decreases by the thermal shutdown hysteresis of\n20°C (typical).\nThis is a non-latching protection, and the device will cycle into and out of thermal shutdown if the fault persists.LM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI\ndoes not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for determining\nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\n9.1.1 Design and Implementation\nTo expedite the process of designing of a LM5145 -based regulator for a given application, use the LM5145\nQuickstart Calculator  available as a free download, as well as numerous LM5145 reference designs populated in\nTI Designs ™ reference design library, or the designs provided in Section 9.2. The LM5145 is also WEBENCH®\nDesigner  enabled.\n9.1.2 Power Train Components\nComprehensive knowledge and understanding of the power train components are key to successfully completing\na synchronous buck regulator design.\n9.1.2.1 Inductor\nFor most applications, choose an inductance such that the inductor ripple current, ΔIL, is between 30% and 40%\nof the maximum DC output current at nominal input voltage. Choose the inductance using Equation 7  based on\na peak inductor current given by Equation 8 .\nOUT IN OUT\nF\nIN L SWV V VLV I F§ · \x10 \x98 ¨ ¸ \' \x98 © ¹ \n(7)\nL\nL(peak) OUTII I 2\' \x0e \n(8)\nCheck the inductor data sheet to ensure that the saturation current of the inductor is well above the peak\ninductor current of a particular design. Ferrite designs have very low core loss and are preferred at high\nswitching frequencies, so design goals can then concentrate on copper loss and preventing saturation. Low\ninductor core loss is evidenced by reduced no-load input current and higher light-load efficiency. However, ferrite\ncore materials exhibit a hard saturation characteristic and the inductance collapses abruptly when the saturation\ncurrent is exceeded. This results in an abrupt increase in inductor ripple current, higher output voltage ripple, not\nto mention reduced efficiency and compromised reliability. Note that the saturation current of an inductor\ngenerally decreases as its core temperature increases. Of course, accurate overcurrent protection is key to\navoiding inductor saturation.\n9.1.2.2 Output Capacitors\nOrdinarily, the output capacitor energy store of the regulator combined with the control loop response are\nprescribed to maintain the integrity of the output voltage within the dynamic (transient) tolerance specifications.\nThe usual boundaries restricting the output capacitor in power management applications are driven by finite\navailable PCB area, component footprint and profile, and cost. The capacitor parasitics—equivalent series\nresistance (ESR) and equivalent series inductance (ESL)—take greater precedence in shaping the load\ntransient response of the regulator as the load step amplitude and slew rate increase.\nThe output capacitor, C OUT, filters the inductor ripple current and provides a reservoir of charge for step-load\ntransient events. Typically, ceramic capacitors provide extremely low ESR to reduce the output voltage ripple\nand noise spikes, while tantalum and electrolytic capacitors provide a large bulk capacitance in a relatively\ncompact footprint for transient loading events.www.ti.comLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\nBased on the static specification of peak-to-peak output voltage ripple denoted by ΔVOUT, choose an output\ncapacitance that is larger than that given by Equation 9 .\n\x0b \x0cL\nOUT2 2\nSW OUT ESR LIC\n8 F V R I\'t\n\x98 \' \x10 \x98\'\n(9)\nFigure 9-1  conceptually illustrates the relevant current waveforms during both load step-up and step-down\ntransitions. As shown, the large-signal slew rate of the inductor current is limited as the inductor current ramps to\nmatch the new load-current level following a load transient. This slew-rate limiting exacerbates the deficit of\ncharge in the output capacitor, which must be replenished as rapidly as possible during and after the load step-\nup transient. Similarly, during and after a load step-down transient, the slew rate limiting of the inductor current\nadds to the surplus of charge in the output capacitor that must be depleted as quickly as possible.\nload current, \niOUT(t)IOUT1\nIOUT2\'IOUT\ntrampIOUT2\nIOUT1\'IOUTinductor current, i L(t)inductor current, i L(t)\nload current, i OUT(t)\'QC\n\'QCOUT OUT\nrampdi I\ndt t\' \nIN OUT L\nFV V di\ndt L\x10 OUT L\nFV di\ndt L \x10 \nFigure 9-1. Load Transient Response Representation Showing C OUT Charge Surplus or Deficit\nIn a typical regulator application of 48-V  input to low output voltage (for example, 5 V), the load-off transient\nrepresents the worst case in terms of output voltage transient deviation. In that conversion ratio application, the\nsteady-state duty cycle is approximately 10% and the large-signal inductor current slew rate when the duty cycle\ncollapses to zero is approximately –V OUT/L. Compared to a load-on transient, the inductor current takes much\nlonger to transition to the required level. The surplus of charge in the output capacitor causes the output voltage\nto significantly overshoot. In fact, to deplete this excess charge from the output capacitor as quickly as possible,\nthe inductor current must ramp below its nominal level following the load step. In this scenario, a large output\ncapacitance can be advantageously employed to absorb the excess charge and limit the voltage overshoot.\nTo meet the dynamic specification of output voltage overshoot during such a load-off transient (denoted as\nΔVOVERSHOOT  with step reduction in output current given by ΔI OUT), the output capacitance should be larger than\n\x0b \x0c2\nF OUT\nOUT 2 2\nOUT OVERSHOOT OUTL I C\nV V V\x98\'t\n\x0e\' \x10\n(10)\nThe ESR of a capacitor is provided in the manufacturer’s data sheet either explicitly as a specification or\nimplicitly in the impedance vs. frequency curve. Depending on type, size and construction, electrolytic capacitors\nhave significant ESR, 5 m Ω and above, and relatively large ESL, 5 nH to 20 nH. PCB traces contribute some\nparasitic resistance and inductance as well. Ceramic output capacitors, on the other hand, have low ESR andLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\nESL contributions at the switching frequency, and the capacitive impedance component dominates. However,\ndepending on package and voltage rating of the ceramic capacitor, the effective capacitance can drop quite\nsignificantly with applied DC voltage and operating temperature.\nIgnoring the ESR term in Equation 9  gives a quick estimation of the minimum ceramic capacitance necessary to\nmeet the output ripple specification. One to four 47-µF, 10-V, X7R capacitors in 1206 or 1210 footprint is a\ncommon choice. Use Equation 10  to determine if additional capacitance is necessary to meet the load-off\ntransient overshoot specification.\nA composite implementation of ceramic and electrolytic capacitors highlights the rationale for paralleling\ncapacitors of dissimilar chemistries yet complementary performance. The frequency response of each capacitor\nis accretive in that each capacitor provides desirable performance over a certain portion of the frequency range.\nWhile the ceramic provides excellent mid- and high-frequency decoupling characteristics with its low ESR and\nESL to minimize the switching frequency output ripple, the electrolytic device with its large bulk capacitance\nprovides low-frequency energy storage to cope with load transient demands.\n9.1.2.3 Input Capacitors\nInput capacitors are necessary to limit the input ripple voltage to the buck power stage due to switching-\nfrequency AC currents. TI recommends using X5R or X7R dielectric ceramic capacitors to provide low\nimpedance and high RMS current rating over a wide temperature range. To minimize the parasitic inductance in\nthe switching loop, position the input capacitors as close as possible to the drain of the high-side MOSFET and\nthe source of the low-side MOSFET. The input capacitor RMS current is given by Equation 11 .\n\x0b \x0c2\n2 L\nCIN,rms OUTII D I 1 D12§ · \'¨ ¸  \x98 \x98 \x10 \x0e¨ ¸ © ¹ \n(11)\nThe highest input capacitor RMS current occurs at D = 0.5, at which point the RMS current rating of the\ncapacitors should be greater than half the output current.\nIdeally, the DC component of input current is provided by the input voltage source and the AC component by the\ninput filter capacitors. Neglecting inductor ripple current, the input capacitors source current of amplitude (I OUT −\nIIN) during the D interval and sinks I IN during the 1 −D interval. Thus, the input capacitors conduct a square-wave\ncurrent of peak-to-peak amplitude equal to the output current. It follows that the resultant capacitive component\nof AC ripple voltage is a triangular waveform.

A MOSFET with low\non-state resistance, R DS(on) , reduces conduction loss, whereas low parasitic capacitances enable fasterwww.ti.comLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\ntransition times and reduced switching loss. Normally, the lower the R DS(on)  of a MOSFET, the higher the gate\ncharge and output charge (Q G and Q OSS respectively), and vice versa. As a result, the product R DS(on)  × Q G is\ncommonly specified as a MOSFET figure-of-merit. Low thermal resistance ensures that the MOSFET power\ndissipation does not result in excessive MOSFET die temperature.\nThe main parameters affecting power MOSFET selection in a LM5145 application are as follows:\n• R DS(on)  at V GS = 7.5 V\n• Drain-source voltage rating, BV DSS, typically 60 V, 80 V or 100 V, depending on maximum input voltage\n• Gate charge parameters at V GS = 7.5 V\n• Output charge, Q OSS, at the relevant input voltage\n• Body diode reverse recovery charge, Q RR\n• Gate threshold voltage, V GS(th) , derived from the Miller plateau evident in the Q G vs. V GS plot in the MOSFET\ndata sheet. With a Miller plateau voltage typically in the range of 2 V to 5 V, the 7.5-V gate drive amplitude of\nthe LM5145 provides an adequately-enhanced MOSFET when on and a margin against Cdv/dt shoot-through\nwhen off.\nThe MOSFET-related power losses are summarized by the equations presented in Table 9-1 , where suffixes 1\nand 2 represent high-side and low-side MOSFET parameters, respectively. While the influence of inductor ripple\ncurrent is considered, second-order loss modes, such as those related to parasitic inductances and SW node\nringing, are not included. Consult the LM5145 Quickstart Calculator  to assist with power loss calculations.\nTable 9-1.

The MOSFET junction temperature, T J, and its\nrise over ambient temperature is dependent upon the device total power dissipation and its thermal impedance. When operating at or\nnear minimum input voltage, ensure that the MOSFET R DS(on)  is rated at V GS = 4.5 V.\n(3) D\' = 1–D is the duty cycle complement.\n(4) MOSFET output capacitances, C oss1 and C oss2, are highly non-linear with voltage. These capacitances are charged losslessly by the\ninductor current at high-side MOSFET turn-off. During turn-on, however, a current flows from the input to charge the output\ncapacitance of the low-side MOSFET. E oss1, the energy of C oss1, is dissipated at turn-on, but this is offset by the stored energy E oss2 on\nCoss2.\n(5) MOSFET body diode reverse recovery charge, Q RR, depends on many parameters, particularly forward current, current transition\nspeed and temperature.\nThe high-side (control) MOSFET carries the inductor current during the PWM on-time (or D interval) and typically\nincurs most of the switching losses. It is therefore imperative to choose a high-side MOSFET that balances\nconduction and switching loss contributions. The total power dissipation in the high-side MOSFET is the sum of\nthe losses due to conduction, switching (voltage-current overlap), output charge, and typically two-thirds of the\nnet loss attributed to body diode reverse recovery.LM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\nThe low-side (synchronous) MOSFET carries the inductor current when the high-side MOSFET is off (or 1–D\ninterval). The low-side MOSFET switching loss is negligible as it is switched at zero voltage – current just\ncommutates from the channel to the body diode or vice versa during the transition deadtimes. The LM5145, with\nits adaptive gate drive timing, minimizes body diode conduction losses when both MOSFETs are off. Such losses\nscale directly with switching frequency.\nIn high step-down ratio applications, the low-side MOSFET carries the current for a large portion of the switching\nperiod. Therefore, to attain high efficiency, it is critical to optimize the low-side MOSFET for low R DS(on) . In cases\nwhere the conduction loss is too high or the target R DS(on)  is lower than available in a single MOSFET, connect\ntwo low-side MOSFETs in parallel. The total power dissipation of the low-side MOSFET is the sum of the losses\ndue to channel conduction, body diode conduction, and typically one-third of the net loss attributed to body diode\nreverse recovery. The LM5145 is well suited to drive TI\'s portfolio of NexFET™ power MOSFETs.\n9.1.3 Control Loop Compensation\nThe poles and zeros inherent to the power stage and compensator are respectively illustrated by red and blue\ndashed rings in the schematic embedded in Table 9-2 .\nTable 9-2.

One compensator pole is located at the origin to realize high DC gain. The normal compensation\nstrategy uses two compensator zeros to counteract the LC double pole, one compensator pole located to nullify\nthe output capacitor ESR zero, with the remaining compensator pole located at one-half switching frequency to\nattenuate high frequency noise. The resistor divider network to FB determines the desired output voltage. Note\nthat the lower feedback resistor, R FB2, has no impact on the control loop from an AC standpoint because the FB\nnode is the input to an error amplifier and is effectively at AC ground. Hence, the control loop is designed\nirrespective of output voltage level. The proviso here is the necessary output capacitance derating with bias\nvoltage and temperature.www.ti.comLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\nThe small-signal open-loop response of a buck regulator is the product of modulator, power train and\ncompensator transfer functions. The power stage transfer function can be represented as a complex pole pair\nassociated with the output LC filter and a zero related to the ESR of the output capacitor. The DC (and low\nfrequency) gain of the modulator and power stage is V IN/VRAMP . The gain from COMP to the average voltage at\nthe input of the LC filter is held essentially constant by the PWM line feedforward feature of the LM5145 (15 V/V\nor 23.5 dB).\nComplete expressions for small-signal frequency analysis are presented in Table 9-3 . The transfer functions are\ndenoted in normalized form. While the loop gain is of primary importance, a regulator is not specified directly by\nits loop gain but by its performance related characteristics, namely closed-loop output impedance and audio\nsusceptibility.\nTable 9-3.

Inserting\nan appropriate crossover frequency into Equation 16  gives a target for the mid-band gain of the compensator,\nKmid. Given an initial value for R FB1, RFB2 is then selected based on the desired output voltage. Values for R C1,\nRC2, CC1, CC2, and C C3 are calculated from the design expressions listed in Table 9-4 , with the premise that the\ncompensator poles and zeros are set as follows: ω z1 = 0.5·ω o, ωz2 = ω o, ωp1 = ω SW/2, and ω p2 = ω ESR.\nTable 9-4.

A target of 50° to 70° for this parameter is considered ideal. Additional phase\nboost is dialed in by locating the compensator zeros at a frequency lower than the LC double pole (hence why\nCC1 is scaled by a factor of 2 above). This helps mitigate the phase dip associated with the LC filter, particularly\nat light loads when the Q-factor is higher and the phase dip becomes especially prominent. The ramification of\nlow phase in the frequency domain is an under-damped transient response in the time domain.\nThe power supply designer now has all the necessary expressions to optimally position the loop crossover\nfrequency while maintaining adequate phase margin over the required line, load and temperature operating\nranges. The LM5145 Quickstart Calculator  is available to expedite these calculations and to adjust the bode plot\nas needed.\n9.1.4 EMI Filter Design\nSwitching regulators exhibit negative input impedance, which is lowest at the minimum input voltage.

The design occupies 30 mm × 15 mm on a single-sided PCB. The overcurrent\n(OC) setpoint in this design is set at 14 A based on the resistor R ILIM and the 6-m Ω RDS(on)  of the low-side\nMOSFET (typical at T J = 25°C and V GS = 7.5 V). The 12-V output is connected to VCC through a diode, D1, to\nreduce IC bias power dissipation.\nThe selected buck converter powertrain components are cited in Table 9-8 , including power MOSFETs, buck\ninductor, input and output capacitors, and ICs. Use the LM5145 Quickstart Calculator  to find compensation\ncomponents that are selected based on a target loop crossover frequency of 40 kHz and phase margin greater\nthan 55°. The output voltage soft-start time is 4 ms based on the selected soft-start capacitance, C SS, of 33 nF.\nTable 9-8.

The\ncharacteristics of the input supply must be compatible with the Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 tables. In addition,\nthe input supply must be capable of delivering the required input current to the fully-loaded regulator. Estimate\nthe average input current with Equation 23 .\nK \x98\x98 \nINOUT OUT\nINVI VI\n(23)\nwhere\n• η is the efficiency\nIf the converter is connected to an input supply through long wires or PCB traces with a large impedance, take\nspecial care to achieve stable performance. The parasitic inductance and resistance of the input cables may\nhave an adverse affect on converter operation. The parasitic inductance in combination with the low-ESR\nceramic input capacitors form an underdamped resonant circuit. This circuit can cause overvoltage transients at\nVIN each time the input supply is cycled ON and OFF. The parasitic resistance causes the input voltage to dip\nduring a load transient. If the regulator is operating close to the minimum input voltage, this dip can cause false\nUVLO fault triggering and a system reset. The best way to solve such issues is to reduce the distance from the\ninput supply to the regulator and use an aluminum or tantalum input capacitor in parallel with the ceramics. The\nmoderate ESR of the electrolytic capacitors helps to damp the input resonant circuit and reduce any voltage\novershoots. A capacitance in the range of 10 µF to 47 µF is usually sufficient to provide input damping and helps\nto hold the input voltage steady during large load transients.\nAn EMI input filter is often used in front of the regulator that, unless carefully designed, can lead to instability as\nwell as some of the effects mentioned above. The application report Simple Success with Conducted EMI for\nDC-DC Converters  (SNVA489) provides helpful suggestions when designing an input filter for any switching\nregulator.LM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n54 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nProper PCB design and layout is important in a high-current, fast-switching circuits (with high current and voltage\nslew rates) to assure appropriate device operation and design robustness. As expected, certain issues must be\nconsidered before designing a PCB layout using the LM5145 . The high-frequency power loop of the buck\nconverter power stage is denoted by #1 in the shaded area of Figure 11-1 . The topological architecture of a buck\nconverter means that particularly high di/dt current flows in the components of loop 1, and it becomes mandatory\nto reduce the parasitic inductance of this loop by minimizing its effective loop area. Also important is the gate\ndrive loops of the low-side and high-side MOSFETs, denoted by 2 and 3, respectively, in Figure 11-1 .\n17\n19\n14BST\nHO\nSW\nLOVCC\nPGNDVIN\nVOUT\nGNDLM5145\nVCC\n1318\nLow-side \ngate driverHigh-side \ngate driver\n12CVCCCBSTCIN\nCOUTQ1\nQ2LF#1\nHigh frequency \npower loop\n#3#2\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated14\nFigure 11-1. DC-DC Regulator Ground System With Power Stage and Gate Drive Circuit Switching Loops\n11.1.1 Power Stage Layout\n1. Input capacitors, output capacitors, and MOSFETs are the constituent components of the power stage of a\nbuck regulator and are typically placed on the top side of the PCB (solder side). The benefits of convective\nheat transfer are maximized because of leveraging any system-level airflow. In a two-sided PCB layout,\nsmall-signal components are typically placed on the bottom side (component side). insert at least one inner\nplane, connected to ground, to shield and isolate the small-signal traces from noisy power traces and lines.\n2. The DC/DC converter has several high-current loops. Minimize the area of these loops in order to suppress\ngenerated switching noise and parasitic loop inductance and optimize switching performance.\n• Loop #1: The most important loop to minimize the area of is the path from the input capacitor or capacitors\nthrough the high- and low-side MOSFETs, and back to the capacitor(s) through the ground connection.\nConnect the input capacitor or capacitors negative terminal close to the source of the low-side MOSFET\n(at ground). Similarly, connect the input capacitor or capacitors positive terminal close to the drain of the\nhigh-side MOSFET (at VIN). Refer to loop #1 of Figure 11-1 .\n• Another loop, not as critical though as loop #1, is the path from the low-side MOSFET through the inductor\nand output capacitor(s), and back to source of the low-side MOSFET through ground. Connect the source\nof the low-side MOSFET and negative terminal of the output capacitor(s) at ground as close as possible.\n3. The PCB trace defined as SW node, which connects to the source of the high-side (control) MOSFET, the\ndrain of the low-side (synchronous) MOSFET and the high-voltage side of the inductor, must be short and\nwide. However, the SW connection is a source of injected EMI and thus must not be too large.\n4. Follow any layout considerations of the MOSFETs as recommended by the MOSFET manufacturer, including\npad geometry and solder paste stencil design.www.ti.comLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 55\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\n5. The SW pin connects to the switch node of the power conversion stage and acts as the return path for the\nhigh-side gate driver. The parasitic inductance inherent to loop #1 in Figure 11-1  and the output capacitance\n(COSS) of both power MOSFETs form a resonant circuit that induces high frequency (>100 MHz) ringing on\nthe SW node. The voltage peak of this ringing, if not controlled, can be significantly higher than the input\nvoltage. Ensure that the peak ringing amplitude does not exceed the absolute maximum rating limit for the\nSW pin. In many cases, a series resistor and capacitor snubber network connected from the SW node to\nGND damps the ringing and decreases the peak amplitude. Provide provisions for snubber network\ncomponents in the PCB layout. If testing reveals that the ringing amplitude at the SW pin is excessive, then\ninclude snubber components as needed.\n11.1.2 Gate Drive Layout\nThe LM5145  high-side and low-side gate drivers incorporate short propagation delays, adaptive dead-time\ncontrol and low-impedance output stages capable of delivering large peak currents with very fast rise and fall\ntimes to facilitate rapid turn-on and turn-off transitions of the power MOSFETs. Very high di/dt can cause\nunacceptable ringing if the trace lengths and impedances are not well controlled.\nMinimization of stray or parasitic gate loop inductance is key to optimizing gate drive switching performance,\nwhether it be series gate inductance that resonates with MOSFET gate capacitance or common source\ninductance (common to gate and power loops) that provides a negative feedback component opposing the gate\ndrive command, thereby increasing MOSFET switching times. The following loops are important:\n• Loop 2: high-side MOSFET, Q 1. During the high-side MOSFET turn-on, high current flows from the bootstrap\n(boot) capacitor through the gate driver and high-side MOSFET, and back to the negative terminal of the boot\ncapacitor through the SW connection. Conversely, to turn off the high-side MOSFET, high current flows from\nthe gate of the high-side MOSFET through the gate driver and SW, and back to the source of the high-side\nMOSFET through the SW trace. Refer to loop #2 of Figure 11-1 .\n• Loop 3: low-side MOSFET, Q 2. During the low-side MOSFET turn-on, high current flows from the VCC\ndecoupling capacitor through the gate driver and low-side MOSFET, and back to the negative terminal of the\ncapacitor through ground. Conversely, to turn off the low-side MOSFET, high current flows from the gate of\nthe low-side MOSFET through the gate driver and GND, and back to the source of the low-side MOSFET\nthrough ground. Refer to loop #3 of Figure 11-1 .\nTI strongly recommends following circuit layout guidelines when designing with high-speed MOSFET gate drive\ncircuits.\n1. Connections from gate driver outputs, HO and LO, to the respective gate of the high-side or low-side\nMOSFET must be as short as possible to reduce series parasitic inductance. Use 0.65 mm (25 mils) or wider\ntraces. Use a via or vias, if necessary, of at least 0.5 mm (20 mils) diameter along these traces. Route HO\nand SW gate traces as a differential pair from the LM5145 to the high-side MOSFET, taking advantage of flux\ncancellation.\n2. Minimize the current loop path from the VCC and BST pins through their respective capacitors as these\nprovide the high instantaneous current, up to 3.5 A, to charge the MOSFET gate capacitances. Specifically,\nlocate the bootstrap capacitor, C BST, close to the BST and SW pins of the LM5145 to minimize the area of\nloop #2 associated with the high-side driver. Similarly, locate the VCC capacitor, C VCC, close to the VCC and\nPGND pins of the LM5145 to minimize the area of loop #3 associated with the low-side driver.\n3. Placing a 2-Ω to 10-Ω resistor in series with the boot capacitor, as shown in Figure 9-20 , slows down the\nhigh-side MOSFET turn-on transition, serving to reduce the voltage ringing and peak amplitude at the SW\nnode at the expense of increased MOSFET turn-on power loss.\n11.1.3 PWM Controller Layout\nWith the proviso to locate the controller as close as possible to the MOSFETs to minimize gate driver trace runs,\nthe components related to the analog and feedback signals, current limit setting, and temperature sense are\nconsidered in the following:\n1. Separate power and signal traces, and use a ground plane to provide noise shielding.\n2. Place all sensitive analog traces and components such as COMP, FB, RT, ILIM and SS/TRK away from high-\nvoltage switching nodes such as SW, HO, LO or BST to avoid mutual coupling. Use an internal layer or layersLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n56 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\nas a ground plane or ground planes. Pay particular attention to shielding the feedback (FB) trace from power\ntraces and components.\n3. The upper feedback resistor can be connected directly to the output voltage sense point at the load device or\nthe bulk capacitor at the converter side.\n4. Connect the ILIM setting resistor from the drain of the low-side MOSFET to ILIM and make the connections\nas close as possible to the LM5145. The trace from the ILIM pin to the resistor must avoid coupling to a high-\nvoltage switching net.\n5. Minimize the loop area from the VCC and VIN pins through their respective decoupling capacitors to the GND\npin. Locate these capacitors as close as possible to the LM5145.\n11.1.4 Thermal Design and Layout\nThe useful operating temperature range of a PWM controller with integrated gate drivers and bias supply LDO\nregulator is greatly affected by:\n• average gate drive current requirements of the power MOSFETs;\n• switching frequency;\n• operating input voltage (affecting bias regulator LDO voltage drop and hence its power dissipation);\n• thermal characteristics of the package and operating environment.\nFor a PWM controller to be useful over a particular temperature range, the package must allow for the efficient\nremoval of the heat produced while keeping the junction temperature within rated limits. The LM5145  controller\nis available in a small 3.5-mm × 4.5-mm 20-pin VQFN (RGY) PowerPAD ™ package to cover a range of\napplication requirements. The thermal metrics of this package are summarized in Section 7.4. The application\nreport Semiconductor and IC Package Thermal Metrics  provides detailed information regarding the thermal\ninformation table.\nThe 20-pin VQFN package offers a means of removing heat from the semiconductor die through the exposed\nthermal pad at the base of the package. While the exposed pad of the package is not directly connected to any\nleads of the package, it is thermally connected to the substrate of the LM5145  device (ground). This allows a\nsignificant improvement in heat sinking, and it becomes imperative that the PCB is designed with thermal lands,\nthermal vias, and a ground plane to complete the heat removal subsystem. The exposed pad of the LM5145  is\nsoldered to the ground-connected copper land on the PCB directly underneath the device package, reducing the\nthermal resistance to a very low value. Wide traces of the copper tying in the no-connect pins of the LM5145\n(pins 9 and 16) and connection to this thermal land helps to dissipate heat.\nNumerous vias with a 0.3-mm diameter connected from the thermal land to the internal and solder-side ground\nplane(s) are vital to help dissipation. In a multi-layer PCB design, a solid ground plane is typically placed on the\nPCB layer below the power components. Not only does this provide a plane for the power stage currents to flow\nbut it also represents a thermally conductive path away from the heat generating devices.\nThe thermal characteristics of the MOSFETs also are significant. The drain pad of the high-side MOSFET is\nnormally connected to a VIN plane for heat sinking. The drain pad of the low-side MOSFET is tied to the SW\nplane, but the SW plane area is purposely kept relatively small to mitigate EMI concerns.\n11.1.5 Ground Plane Design\nAs mentioned previously, using one or more of the inner PCB layers as a solid ground plane is recommended. A\nground plane offers shielding for sensitive circuits and traces and also provides a quiet reference potential for the\ncontrol circuitry. Connect the PGND pin to the system ground plane using an array of vias under the exposed\npad. Also connect the PGND directly to the return terminals of the input and output capacitors. The PGND net\ncontains noise at the switching frequency and can bounce because of load current variations. The power traces\nfor PGND, VIN and SW can be restricted to one side of the ground plane. The other side of the ground plane\ncontains much less noise and is ideal for sensitive analog trace routes.www.ti.comLM5145\nSNVSAI4B – NOVEMBER 2017 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 57\nProduct Folder Links: LM5145\n11.2 Layout Example\nFigure 11-2  shows an example PCB layout based on the LM5145EVM-HD-20A  design. The power component\nconnections are made on the top layer with wide, copper-filled areas. A power ground plane is placed on layer 2\nwith 6 mil (0.15 mm) spacing to the top layer. The small area of the buck regulator hot loop is denoted by the\nwhite border in Figure 11-2 . This is critical to minimize EMI as well as switch-node voltage overshoot and ringing.\nThe LM5145  is located on the bottom side with a surrounding analog ground plane for sensitive analog\ncomponents as shown in Figure 11-3 . The analog ground plane (AGND) and power ground plane (PGND) are\nconnected at a single point directly under the IC (at the die attach pad or DAP).
