C THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD826 is a low cost, wide band, high performance dual \noperational amplifier which can drive heavy capacitive and resistive loads. It also achieves a constant slew rate, bandwidth \nand settling time over its entire specified temperature range.  \nThe AD826 (Figure 35) consists of a degenerated NPN \ndifferential pair driving matched PNPs in a folded-cascode gain \nstage. The output buffer stage employs emitter followers in a \nclass AB amplifier which delivers the necessary current to the \nload while maintaining low levels of distortion. \nOUTPUTCF\nNULL1 NULL8–VS–IN\n+IN+VS\n \nFigure 35. Simplified Schematic \nThe capacitor, C F, in the output stage mitigates the effect of \ncapacitive loads. With low capacitive loads, the gain from the \ncompensation node to the output is very close to unity. In this \ncase, C F is bootstrapped and does not contribute to the overall \ncompensation capacitance of the device. As the capacitive load \nis increased, a pole is formed with the output impedance of the output stage. This reduces the gain, and therefore, C\nF is \nincompletely bootstrapped. Effectively, some fraction of C F \ncontributes to the overall compensation capacitance, reducing the unity gain bandwidth. As the load capacitance is further increased, the bandwidth continues to fall, maintaining the \nstability of the amplifier. \nINPUT CONSIDERATIONS \nAn input protection resistor (R IN in Figure 25) is required in \ncircuits where the input to the AD826 will be subjected to \ntransient or continuous overload voltages exceeding the ±6 V \nmaximum differential limit. This resistor provides protection \nfor the input transistors by limiting their maximum base current.  For high performance circuits, it is recommended that a \n“balancing” resistor be used to reduce the offset errors caused by bias current flowing through the input and feedback resistors. The balancing resistor equals the parallel combination of R\nIN \nand R F and thus provides a matched impedance at each input \nterminal. The offset voltage error will then be reduced by more \nthan an order of magnitude. \nAPPLYING THE AD826 \nThe AD826 is a breakthrough dual amp that delivers precision \nand speed at low cost with low power consumption. The AD826 \noffers excellent static and dynamic matching characteristics, combined with the ability to drive heavy resistive and capacitive loads. As with all high frequency circuits, care should be taken \nto maintain overall device performance as well as their matching. \nThe following items are presented as general design considerations. \nCircuit Board Layout \nInput and output runs should be laid out so as to physically \nisolate them from remaining runs. In addition, the feedback \nresistor of each amplifier should be placed away from the \nfeedback resistor of the other amplifier, since this greatly \nreduces inter-amp coupling. \nChoosing Feedback and Gain Resistors \nIn order to prevent the stray capacitance present at each \namplifier’s summing junction from limiting its performance, \nthe feedback resistors should be ≤1 kΩ. Since the summing junction capacitance may cause peaking, a small capacitor (1 pF–5pF) maybe paralleled with R\nF to neutralize this effect. \nFinally, sockets should be avoided, because of their tendency to \nincrease interlead capacitance. \nPower Supply Considerations \nTo ensure the proper operation of the AD826, connect the \npositive supply before the negative supply. Also, proper power \nsupply decoupling is critical to preserve the integrity of high frequency signals. In carefully laid out designs, decoupling \ncapacitors should be placed in close proximity to the supply \npins, while their lead lengths should be kept to a minimum. These measures greatly reduce undesired inductive effects on \nthe amplifier’s response.  \nThough two 0.1 μF capacitors will typically be effective in \ndecoupling the supplies, several capacitors of different values \ncan be paralleled to cover a wider frequency range. \n \n \nAD826\n–11–/H11550SINGLE SUPPLY OPERATION\nAn exciting feature of the AD826 is its ability to perform well in a\nsingle supply configuration (see Figure 37). The AD826 is ideally\nsuited for applications that require low power dissipation and highoutput current and those which need to drive large capacitive\nloads, such as high speed buffering and instrumentation.\nReferring to Figure 36, careful consideration should be given to\nthe proper selection of component values. The choices for thisparticular circuit are: (R1 + R3) /H20648R2 combine with C1 to form a\nlow frequency corner of approximately 30 Hz.\n/H11545VS\n1/2\nAD826\nR2\n10k/H90243.3/H9262F\n0.01/H9262F\nC3\n0.1/H9262FVOUTR1\n9k/H9024R3\n1k/H9024\nC2\n0.1/H9262F\nVINC1\n1/H9262F\nCL\n200pFRL\n150/H9024COUT\nFigure 36.

C\nAD826\n–12–SINGLE-ENDED TO DIFFERENTIAL LINE DRIVER\nOutstanding CMRR (> 80 dB @ 5 MHz), high bandwidth, wide\nsupply voltage range, and the ability to drive heavy loads, make\nthe AD826 an ideal choice for many line driving applications.In this application, the AD830 high speed video differenceamp serves as the differential line receiver on the end of a back\nterminated, 50 ft., twisted-pair transmission line (see Figure 40).\nThe overall system is configured in a gain of +1 and has a –3 dB\nbandwidth of 14 MHz.

Differential Line Driver\nLOW DISTORTION LINE DRIVER\nThe AD826 can quickly be turned into a powerful, low distor-\ntion line driver (see Figure 41). In this arrangement the AD826\ncan comfortably drive a 75 Ω back-terminated cable, with a\n5 MHz, 2 V p-p input; all of this while achieving the harmonicdistortion performance outlined in the following table.\nConfiguration 2nd Harmonic\n1.

This is important for two\nreasons: the first is to keep the bandwidth of both amplifiers thesame, and the second is to preserve the AD826 ’s ability to oper-\nate from low supply voltages. R\nC varies with the load and must\nbe chosen to satisfy the following equation:\nRC = MR L\nwhere M is defined by [(M+ 1) G S = G D] and G D = Driver’ s Gain,\nGS = System Gain.1.1k/H9024\n1k/H90241k/H9024\nRL1/2\nAD826\n1/2\nAD826RC\n7.5/H90241k/H9024\n75/H902475/H9024\n75/H9024/H11545VS 1/H9262F\n0.1/H9262F\n0.1/H9262F1/H9262F\nFigure 41.
