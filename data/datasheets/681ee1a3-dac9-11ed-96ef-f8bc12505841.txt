In high-performance memory systems, these \ndecoders can be used to minimize the effects of \nsystem decoding. When employed with high-speed \nmemories using a fast enable circuit, the delay times \nof these decoders and the enable time of the memory \nare usually less than the typical access time of the \nmemory. This means that the effective system delay \nintroduced by the decoders is negligible.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nSN74HC138D SOIC (16) 9.90 mm x 3.90 mm\nSN74HC138DB SSOP (16) 6.20 mm x 5.30 mm\nSN74HC138N PDIP (16) 19.32 mm x 6.35 mm\nSN74HC138NS SO (16) 10.20 mm x 5.30 mm\nSN74HC138PW TSSOP (16) 5.00 mm x 4.40 mm\nSN54HC138J CDIP (16) 21.34 mm x 6.92 mm\nSN54HC138W CFP (16) 10.16 mm x 6.73 mm\nSN54HC138FK LCCC (20) 8.89 mm x 8.89 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nPin numbers shown are for the D, DB, J, N, NS, PW, and W packages.\nFunctional Block DIagramSN54HC138 , SN74HC138\nSCLS107G  – DECEMBER 1982 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The three input pins, A, B, and C, select \nwhich output is active. The selected output is pulled LOW, while the remaining outputs are all HIGH. The \nconditions at the binary-select inputs at the three enable inputs select one of eight output lines. Two active-low \nand one active-high enable inputs reduce the requirement for external gates or inverters when expanding. A \n24-line decoder can be implemented without external inverters, and a 32-line decoder requires only one inverter. \nAn enable input can be used as a data input for demultiplexing applications.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nPin numbers shown are for the D, DB, J, N, NS, PW, and W packages.\n8.3 Feature Description\nThis device features three binary inputs to select a single active-low output. Three enable pins are also available \nto enable or disable the outputs. One active high enable and two active low enable pins are available, and any \nenable pin can be deactivated to force all outputs high. All three enable pins must be active for the output to be \nenabled.www.ti.comSN54HC138, SN74HC138\nSCLS107G – DECEMBER 1982 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: SN54HC138  SN74HC138\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nTable 8-1  lists the functions of the SNx4HC138 devices.\nTable 8-1.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN74HC138 is useful as a scanning column selector for an LED Matrix display as it can be used for the \nlow side drive of the LED string. The decoder functionality ensures that no more than one output is pulled to a \nlow-level logic voltage so that only a single column is enabled at any point in time.\n9.2 Typical Application\nSN74HC595B\nSN74HC1380V\n3.3V\n3.3V 0VSER\nSRCLK\nRCLKGPIO Inputs\nGPIO InputsA\nB\nCHIGH\nHIGH\nHIGHY0 Y7QA\nQH\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 9-1. LED Matrix Driver Application\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nThese devices use CMOS technology and have balanced output drive. Take care to avoid bus contention \nbecause it can drive currents that would exceed maximum limits. The high drive also creates fast edges into light \nloads, so routing and load conditions must be considered to prevent ringing.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n1.Recommended Input Conditions\n•For switch time specifications, see propagation delay times in Section 6.9.\n•For input voltage level specifications for control inputs, see V IH and V IL in Section 6.6.\n2.Recommended Output Conditions\n•Outputs must not be pulled above V CC or below GND.www.ti.comSN54HC138, SN74HC138\nSCLS107G – DECEMBER 1982 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: SN54HC138  SN74HC138\n9.2.3 Application Curve\nSupply Voltage V CC (V)Logic Level (V)\n2 2.4 2.8 3.2 3.6 4 4.4 4.8 5.2 5.6 600.511.522.533.544.55\nD002VIH MIN\nVIL MAX\nFigure 9-2. Input High and Input Low Thresholds vs Supply Voltage\n10 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe power supply can be any voltage between the minimum and maximum supply voltage rating located in the \nSection 6.3.\nEach V CC terminal must have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. A 0.1-µF bypass capacitor \nis recommended to be placed close to the V CC terminal. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass capacitors \nto reject different frequencies of noise; 0.1-µF and 1-µF capacitors are commonly used in parallel. The bypass \ncapacitor must be installed as close to the power terminal as possible for best results.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nReflections and matching are closely related to loop antenna theory, but different enough to warrant their own \ndiscussion. When a PCB trace turns a corner at a 90° angle, a reflection can occur. This is primarily due to the \nchange of width of the trace. At the apex of the turn, the trace width is increased to 1.414 times its width. This \nupsets the transmission line characteristics, especially the distributed capacitance and self–inductance of the \ntrace (resulting in the reflection). It is a given that not all PCB traces can be straight, and so they have to turn \ncorners. Figure 11-1  shows progressively better techniques of rounding corners. Only the last example maintains \nconstant trace width and minimizes reflections.\n11.2 Layout Example\nWORST BETTER BEST\n1W min.\nW2W\nFigure 11-1.
