### Component Summary: CTS 219-3LPST SMD DIP Switch

#### Key Specifications:
- **Voltage Ratings**: 
  - Nonswitching Rating: 100VDC or 50VDC
- **Current Ratings**: 
  - Actuation Life: 100 mA @ 20 VDC, 0.1 mA @ 5 VDC (dry circuit)
  - Nonswitching Rating: 100 mA or 50 mA
- **Power Consumption**: Not explicitly stated; however, the current ratings imply low power consumption typical for DIP switches.
- **Operating Temperature Range**: 
  - -55°C to +85°C
- **Storage Temperature Range**: 
  - -55°C to +85°C
- **Package Type**: 
  - Surface Mount Device (SMD) with options for Gull-wing or J-bend terminal configurations.
- **Special Features**: 
  - Positive detent mechanism to prevent contactor deflection during actuation.
  - Optional top tape seal for enhanced protection during board washing.
  - Available in low profile, medium, and extended height actuators.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL)**: 
  - Level 1 (no special precautions needed for soldering).

#### Description:
The CTS 219-3LPST is a Surface Mount Device (SMD) DIP switch designed for compact applications. It features a Single Pole Single Throw (SPST) configuration with a unique positive detent mechanism that ensures the contactor does not deflect during actuation. This design allows for reliable operation in small form factor applications. The switch is available in various actuator heights and can be packaged with or without a top tape seal, making it suitable for automated assembly processes.

#### Typical Applications:
The CTS 219-3LPST SMD DIP switch is commonly used in:
- **Server Systems**: For configuration settings and system management.
- **Security Systems**: To enable or disable features or settings.
- **HVAC Systems**: For control and configuration of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.
- **Consumer Electronics**: In devices requiring user-configurable settings.
- **Industrial Equipment**: For machine settings and operational modes.

This component is ideal for applications where space is limited, and reliability is critical, particularly in environments that require board washing during assembly.
