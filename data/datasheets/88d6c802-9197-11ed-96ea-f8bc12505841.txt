These switches \noffer ultralow charge injection of 1 pC over the full input signal \nrange and typical leakage currents of 10 pA at 25°C. \nThe devices are fully specified for ±5 V , +5 V , and +3 V supplies. \nEach contains four independent single-pole, single-throw (SPST) switches. The ADG611 and ADG612 differ only in that the digital control logic is inverted. The ADG611 switches are turned on with a logic low on the appropriate control input, whereas a \nlogic high is required to turn on the switches of the ADG612. \nThe ADG613 contains two switches with digital control logic \nsimilar to that of the ADG611 and two switches in which the \nlogic is inverted. Each switch conducts equally well  in both directions when on \nand has an input signal range that extends to the supplies. The \nADG613 exhibits break-before-make switching action. The ADG611/ADG612/ADG613 are available in a small, 16-lead TSSOP package, and the ADG611 is also available in a 16-lead \nSOIC package. \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Ultralow charge injection (1 pC typically). \n2. Dual ±2.7 V to ±5.5 V or single  +2.7 V to +5.5 V operation. \n3. Automotive temperature range: −40°C to +125°C. \n4. Small, 16-lead TSSOP and SOIC packages. \n \n \nADG611/ADG612/ADG613  \n \nRev.
