General description\nThe 74HC74 and 74HCT74 are dual positive edge triggered D-type flip-flop. They have individual\ndata (nD), clock (nCP), set (n SD) and reset (n RD) inputs, and complementary nQ and n Q outputs.\nData at the nD-input, that meets the set-up and hold time requirements on the LOW-to-HIGH clock\ntransition, is stored in the flip-flop and appears at the nQ output. Schmitt-trigger action in the clock\ninput, makes the circuit highly tolerant to slower clock rise and fall times. Inputs include clamp\ndiodes that enable the use of current limiting resistors to interface inputs to voltages in excess of\nVCC.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range from 2.0 to 6.0 V\n•CMOS low power dissipation\n•High noise immunity\n•Input levels:\n•For 74HC74: CMOS level\n•For 74HCT74: TTL level\n•Symmetrical output impedance\n•High noise immunity\n•Balanced propagation delays\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78 Class II Level B\n•Complies with JEDEC standards:\n•JESD8C (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•JESD7A (2.0 V to 6.0 V)\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM JESD22-A114F exceeds 2000 V\n•MM JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and from -40 °C to +125 °C\n3.

#### Description:
The **74HC74D** is a dual D-type flip-flop integrated circuit that operates on positive edge-triggered clock signals. It features individual data, clock, set, and reset inputs, along with complementary outputs. The device is designed to store data at the input when the clock transitions from low to high, making it suitable for various digital applications. The Schmitt-trigger action on the clock input enhances its tolerance to slower clock rise and fall times.

#### Typical Applications:
The 74HC74D is commonly used in:
- **Data Storage**: As a memory element in digital circuits.
- **State Machines**: For implementing finite state machines in digital logic designs.
- **Timing Circuits**: In applications requiring precise timing and synchronization.
- **Frequency Division**: Used in frequency dividers and counters.
- **Signal Processing**: For data manipulation and control in various electronic systems.

This component is ideal for applications in consumer electronics, automotive systems, and industrial automation where reliable data storage and processing are essential.
