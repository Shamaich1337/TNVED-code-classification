- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Reverse Standoff Voltage (VRWM): 5 V
  - Breakdown Voltage (VBR): 5.8 to 8.8 V (at 5 mA)
  
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Rated Peak Pulse Current (IPPM): 1.3 A (tp = 8/20 µs)
  - Reverse Leakage Current (IRM): 1 nA (at VRWM = 5 V)

- **Power Consumption:**
  - The device does not have a specified power consumption rating, as it primarily functions as a protective component.

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Junction Temperature (Tj): -55 °C to 150 °C
  - Ambient Temperature (Tamb): -55 °C to 150 °C
  - Storage Temperature (Tstg): -65 °C to 150 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - SOD323 (SC-76), a small surface-mounted package with dimensions of 1.7 mm x 1.25 mm x 0.95 mm.

- **Special Features:**
  - ESD protection up to 9 kV (IEC 61000-4-2, level 4).
  - Ultra-low diode capacitance: 2 pF (typical at 0 V).
  - AEC-Q101 qualified, making it suitable for automotive applications.
  
- **Moisture Sensitive Level:**
  - Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL): Not specified in the provided data, but typically SMD components are rated according to JEDEC J-STD-020E.

**Typical Applications:**
The PESD5V0U1UA is commonly used in various applications where ESD protection is critical, including:
- USB interfaces
- 10/100/1000 Mbit/s Ethernet connections
- FireWire connections
