Eight registers are\nused for the clock/calendar function and are configured in binary-coded decimal (BCD) format. Further eight\nregisters provide status/control of alarm, 32 kHz output, calibration, and watchdog functions. Addresses and data\nare transferred serially via a two-line, bidirectional I²C interface. The built-in address register is incremented\nautomatically after each WRITE or READ data byte.\nFunctions available to the user include a time-of-day clock/calendar, an alarm interrupt ( M41T62 /M41T65 ), a 32\nkHz output ( M41T62 /M41T64 ), a programmable square wave output ( M41T62 /M41T64 ), and a watchdog output\n(M41T65 ). The eight clock address locations contain the century, year, month, date, day, hour, minute, second\nand tenths/hundredths of a second in 24-hour BCD format. Corrections for 28-, 29- (leap year), 30- and 31-day\nmonths are made automatically.\nThe M41T6x is supplied in two very small packages: a tiny, 3 x 3 mm 16-pin QFN which requires a user-supplied\n32 kHz crystal, and an ultra-small 1.5 x 3.2 mm LCC with embedded crystal - no external crystal is required.\nTable 1.

Access is obtained by implementing a start\ncondition followed by the correct slave address (D0h). The 16 bytes contained in the device can then be accessed\nsequentially in the following order:\n• 1st byte: tenths/hundredths of a second register\n• 2nd byte: seconds register\n• 3rd byte: minutes register\n• 4th byte: hours register\n• 5th byte: square wave/day register\n• 6th byte: date register\n• 7th byte: century/month register\n• 8th byte: year register\n• 9th byte: calibration register\n• 10th byte: watchdog register\n• 11th - 15th bytes: alarm registers\n• 16th byte: flags register\n2.1 2-wire bus characteristics\nThe bus is intended for communication between different ICs. It consists of two lines: a bi-directional data signal\n(SDA) and a clock signal (SCL). Both the SDA and SCL lines must be connected to a positive supply voltage via a\npull-up resistor.\nThe following protocol has been defined:\n• Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\n• During data transfer, the data line must remain stable whenever the clock line is high.\n• Changes in the data line, while the clock line is high, will be interpreted as control signals.\nAccordingly, the following bus conditions have been defined.\n2.1.1 Bus not busy\nBoth data and clock lines remain high.\n2.1.2 Start data transfer\nA change in the state of the data line, from high to low, while the clock is high, defines the START condition.\n2.1.3 Stop data transfer\nA change in the state of the data line, from low to high, while the clock is high, defines the STOP condition.\n2.1.4 Data valid\nThe state of the data line represents valid data when after a start condition, the data line is stable for the duration\nof the high period of the clock signal. The data on the line may be changed during the Low period of the clock\nsignal. There is one clock pulse per bit of data.\nEach data transfer is initiated with a start condition and terminated with a stop condition. The number of data\nbytes transferred between the start and stop conditions is not limited. The information is transmitted byte-wide\nand each receiver acknowledges with a ninth bit.\nBy definition a device that gives out a message is called “transmitter,” the receiving device that gets the message\nis called “receiver.” The device that controls the message is called “master.” The devices that are controlled by the\nmaster are called “slaves.”M41T62, M41T64, M41T65\nOperation\nDS3840  - Rev 24 page 7/42\n2.1.5 Acknowledge\nEach byte of eight bits is followed by one acknowledge bit. This acknowledge bit is a low level put on the bus by\nthe receiver whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse. A slave receiver which is\naddressed is obliged to generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte that has been clocked out of\nthe slave transmitter.\nThe device that acknowledges has to pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse in such a way\nthat the SDA line is a stable Low during the high period of the acknowledge related clock pulse. Of course, setup\nand hold times must be taken into account. A master receiver must signal an end of data to the slave transmitter\nby not generating an acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this case the\ntransmitter must leave the data line high to enable the master to generate the STOP condition.\nFigure 11.

READ mode\nsequence ). Following the WRITE mode control bit (R/W̅=0) and the acknowledge bit, the word address \'An\' is\nwritten to the on-chip address pointer. Next the START condition and slave address are repeated followed by the\nREAD mode control bit (R/W̅=1). At this point the master transmitter becomes the master receiver. The data byte,\nwhich was addressed is transmitted and the master receiver sends an acknowledge bit to the slave transmitter.\nThe address pointer is only incremented on reception of an acknowledge clock. The M41T6x slave transmitter\nnow places the data byte at address An+1 on the bus, the master receiver reads and acknowledges the new byte\nand the address pointer is incremented to “An+2.”\nThis cycle of reading consecutive addresses continues until the master receiver sends a STOP condition to the\nslave transmitter.M41T62, M41T64, M41T65\nREAD mode\nDS3840  - Rev 24 page 8/42\nThe system-to-user transfer of clock data will be halted whenever the address being read is a clock address (00h\nto 07h). The update will resume due to a stop condition or when the pointer increments to any non-clock address\n(08h-0Fh).\nNote: This is true both in READ mode and WRITE mode .\nAn alternate READ mode may also be implemented whereby the master reads the M41T6x slave without first\nwriting to the (volatile) address pointer. The first address that is read is the last one stored in the pointer (see\nFigure 15. Alternative READ mode sequence ).\nFigure 13.

Bus protocol is shown in\nFigure 16. WRITE mode sequence . Following the START condition and slave address, a logic \'0\' (R/W̅=0) is\nplaced on the bus and indicates to the addressed device that word address “An” will follow and is to be written to\nthe on-chip address pointer. The data word to be written to the memory is strobed in next and the internal address\npointer is incremented to the next address location on the reception of an acknowledge clock. The M41T6x slave\nreceiver will send an acknowledge clock to the master transmitter after it has received the slave address see\nFigure 13. Slave address location  and again after it has received the word address and each data byte.\nFigure 16.

The accuracy of\nthe real-time clock depends on the frequency of the quartz crystal that is used as the time-base for the RTC.\nThe eight byte clock register (see Table 3. M41T62 register map , Table 4. M41T64 register map , and\nTable 5. M41T65 register map ) is used to both set the clock and to read the date and time from the clock, in a\nbinary-coded decimal format. Tenths/hundredths of seconds, seconds, minutes, and hours are contained within\nthe first four registers.\nA WRITE to any clock register will result in the tenths/hundredths of seconds being reset to “00,” and tenths/\nhundredths of seconds cannot be written to any value other than “00.”\nBits D0 through D2 of register 04h contain the day (day of week). Registers 05h, 06h, and 07h contain the date\n(day of month), month, and years. The ninth clock register is the calibration register (this is described in the clock\ncalibration section). Bit D7 of register 01h contains the STOP bit (ST). Setting this bit to a \'1\' will cause the\noscillator to stop. When reset to a \'0\' the oscillator restarts within one second (typical).\nUpon initial power-up, the user should set the ST bit to a \'1,\' then immediately reset the ST bit to \'0.\' This provides\nan additional “kick-start” to the oscillator circuit.\nBit D7 of register 02h (minute register) contains the oscillator fail interrupt enable bit (OFIE). When the user sets\nthis bit to \'1,\' any condition which sets the oscillator fail bit (OF) (see Section  3.11  Oscillator stop detection ) will\nalso generate an interrupt output.\nBits D6 and D7 of clock register 06h (century/month register) contain the CENTURY bit 0 (CB0) and CENTURY\nbit 1 (CB1).\nA WRITE to ANY location within the first eight bytes of the clock register (00h-07h), including the OFIE bit, RS0-\nRS3 bit, and CB0-CB1 bits will result in an update of the system clock and a reset of the divider chain. This could\nresult in an inadvertent change of the current time. These non-clock related bits should be written prior to setting\nthe clock, and remain unchanged until such time as a new clock time is also written.\nThe eight clock registers may be read one byte at a time, or in a sequential block. Provision has been made to\nassure that a clock update does not occur while any of the eight clock addresses are being read. If a clock\naddress is being read, an update of the clock registers will be halted. This will prevent a transition of data during\nthe READ.\n3.1 RTC registers\nThe M41T6x user interface is comprised of 16 memory mapped registers which include clock, calibration, alarm,\nwatchdog, flags, and square wave control. The eight clock counters are accessed indirectly via a set of buffer/\ntransfer registers while the other eight registers are directly accessed. Data in the clock and alarm registers is in\nBCD format.M41T62, M41T64, M41T65\nClock operation\nDS3840  - Rev 24 page 11/42\nFigure 17.

At the start of an I²C read or write cycle, the updating is halted and the present\ntime is frozen in the buffer/transfer registers.\nReads of the clock registers\nBy halting the updates at the start of an I²C access, the user is ensured that all the data transferred out during a\nread sequence comes from the same instant in time.\nWrite timing\nWhen writing to the device, the data is shifted into the M41T62\'s I²C interface on the rising edge of the SCL\nsignal. As shown in Figure 17. Buffer/transfer registers , on the 8th clock cycle, the data is transferred from the I²C\nblock into whichever register is being pointed to by the address pointer (not shown).\nWrites to the clock registers (addresses 0-7)\nData written to the clock registers (addresses 0-7) is held in the buffer registers until the address pointer\nincrements to 8, or an I²C stop condition occurs, at which time the data in the buffer/registers is simultaneously\ncopied into the counters, and then the clock is re-started.M41T62, M41T64, M41T65\nRTC registers\nDS3840  - Rev 24 page 12/42\nTable 3.

The accuracy of the clock depends on the frequency accuracy of the\ncrystal, and the match between the capacitive load of the oscillator circuit and the capacitive load for which the\ncrystal was trimmed. The M41T6x oscillator is designed for use with a 6 - 7 pF crystal load capacitance. When the\ncalibration circuit is properly employed, accuracy improves to better than ± 2 ppm at 25 °C.\nThe oscillation rate of crystals changes with temperature (see Figure 18. Crystal accuracy across temperature ).\nTherefore, the M41T6x design employs periodic counter correction. The calibration circuit adds or subtracts\ncounts from the oscillator divider circuit at the divide by 256 stage, as shown in Figure 19. Calibration waveform .\nThe number of times pulses which are blanked (subtracted, negative calibration) or split (added, positive\ncalibration) depends upon the value loaded into the five calibration bits found in the calibration register. Adding\ncounts speeds the clock up, subtracting counts slows the clock down.\nThe calibration bits occupy the five lower order bits (D4-D0) in the calibration register (08h). These bits can be set\nto represent any value between 0 and 31 in binary form. Bit D5 is a sign bit; \'1\' indicates positive calibration, \'0\'\nindicates negative calibration. Calibration occurs within a 64 minute cycle. The first 62 minutes in the cycle may,\nonce per minute, have one second either shortened by 128 or lengthened by 256 oscillator cycles. If a binary \'1\' is\nloaded into the register, only the first 2 minutes in the 64 minute cycle will be modified; if a binary 6 is loaded, the\nfirst 12 will be affected, and so on.\nTherefore, each calibration step has the effect of adding 512 or subtracting 256 oscillator cycles for every\n125,829,120 actual oscillator cycles, that is +4.068 or –2.034 ppm of adjustment per calibration step in the\ncalibration register.\nAssuming that the oscillator is running at exactly 32.768 kHz, each of the 31 increments in the calibration byte\nwould represent +10.7 or –5.35 seconds per day which corresponds to a total range of +5.5 or –2.75 minutes per\nmonth (see Figure 19. Calibration waveform ).\nTwo methods are available for ascertaining how much calibration a given M41T6x may require:\n• The first involves setting the clock, letting it run for a month and comparing it to a known accurate reference\nand recording deviation over a fixed period of time. Calibration values, including the number of seconds lost\nor gained in a given period, can be found in application note AN934. This allows the designer to give the end\nuser the ability to calibrate the clock as the environment requires, even if the final product is packaged in a\nnon-user serviceable enclosure. The designer could provide a simple utility that accesses the calibration\nbyte.\n• The second approach is better suited to a manufacturing environment, and involves the use of either the\nSQW pin (M41T62/64) or the IRQ /FT/OUT pin (M41T65). The SQW pin will toggle at 512 Hz when RS3 =\n\'0,\' RS2 = \'1,\' RS1 = \'1,\' RS0 = \'0,\' SQWE = \'1,\' and ST = \'0.\' Alternatively, for the M41T65, the IRQ /FT/OUT\npin will toggle at 512 Hz when FT and OUT bits = \'1\' and ST = \'0.\'\nAny deviation from 512 Hz indicates the degree and direction of oscillator frequency shift at the test temperature.\nFor example, a reading of 512.010124 Hz would indicate a +20 ppm oscillator frequency error, requiring a –10\n(XX001010) to be loaded into the calibration byte for correction. Note that setting or changing the calibration byte\ndoes not affect the frequency test or square wave output frequency.M41T62, M41T64, M41T65\nCalibrating the clock\nDS3840  - Rev 24 page 16/42\nFigure 18.

Calibration waveform\nNORMAL\nPOSITIVE\nCALIBRATION\nNEGATIVE\nCALIBRATION\n3.3 Setting alarm clock registers\nAddress locations 0Ah-0Eh contain the alarm settings. The alarm can be configured to go off at a prescribed time\non a specific month, date, hour, minute, or second, or repeat every year, month, day, hour, minute, or second. Bits\nRPT5–RPT1 put the alarm in the repeat mode of operation. Table 6. Alarm repeat modes  shows the possible\nconfigurations. Codes not listed in the table default to the once per second mode to quickly alert the user of an\nincorrect alarm setting.\nWhen the clock information matches the alarm clock settings based on the match criteria defined by RPT5–RPT1,\nthe AF (alarm flag) is set. If AFE (alarm flag enable) is also set (M41T62/65), the alarm condition activates the\nIRQ /OUT or IRQ /FT/OUT pin. To disable the alarm, write \'0\' to the alarm date register and to RPT5–RPT1.\nNote: If the address pointer is allowed to increment to the flag register address, an alarm condition will not cause\nthe interrupt/flag to occur until the address pointer is moved to a different address. It should also be noted that if\nthe last address written is the “Alarm Seconds,” the address pointer will increment to the flag address, causing\nthis situation to occur.\nThe IRQ output is cleared by a READ to the flags register as shown in Figure 20. Alarm interrupt reset waveform .\nA subsequent READ of the flags register is necessary to see that the value of the alarm flag has been reset to \'0.\'M41T62, M41T64, M41T65\nSetting alarm clock registers\nDS3840  - Rev 24 page 17/42\nFigure 20.

The user programs the watchdog\ntimer by setting the desired amount of time-out into the watchdog register, address 09h.\nBits BMB4-BMB0 store a binary multiplier and the three bits RB2-RB0 select the resolution where:\n000=1/16 second (16 Hz);\n001=1/4 second (4 Hz);\n010=1 second (1 Hz);\n011=4 seconds (1/4 Hz); and\n100 = 1 minute (1/60 Hz).\nNote: Invalid combinations (101, 110, and 111) will NOT enable a watchdog time-out. Setting BMB4-BMB0 =\n00000 with any combination of RB2-RB0, other than 000, will result in an immediate watchdog time-out.\nThe amount of time-out is then determined to be the multiplication of the five-bit multiplier value with the\nresolution. (For example: writing 00001110 in the watchdog register = 3*1 or 3 seconds). If the processor does not\nreset the timer within the specified period, the M41T6x sets the WDF (watchdog flag) and generates an interrupt\non the IRQ pin (M41T62), or a watchdog output pulse (M41T65 only) on the WDO  pin. The watchdog timer can\nonly be reset by having the microprocessor perform a WRITE of the watchdog register. The time-out period then\nstarts over.\nShould the watchdog timer time out, any value may be written to the watchdog register in order to clear the IRQ\npin. A value of 00h will disable the watchdog function until it is again programmed to a new value. A READ of the\nflags register will reset the watchdog flag (bit D7; register 0Fh). The watchdog function is automatically disabled\nupon power-up, and the watchdog register is cleared.\nNote: A WRITE to any clock register will restart the watchdog timer.M41T62, M41T64, M41T65\nWatchdog timer\nDS3840  - Rev 24 page 18/42\n3.5 Watchdog output (  WDO  - M41T65 only)\nIf the processor does not reset the watchdog timer within the specified period, the watchdog output (  WDO  ) will\npulse low for t rec (see Table 7. Square wave output frequency ). This output may be connected to the reset input of\nthe processor in order to generate a processor reset. After a watchdog time-out occurs, the timer will remain\ndisabled until such time as a new countdown value is written into the watchdog register.\nNote: The crystal oscillator must be running for the WDO  pulse to be available. The WDO  output is an N-channel,\nopen drain output driver (with I OL as specified in Table 13. DC characteristics ).\n3.6 Square wave output (M41T62/64)\nThe M41T62/64 offers the user a programmable square wave function which is output on the SQW pin. RS3-RS0\nbits located in 04h establish the square wave output frequency. These frequencies are listed in Table 7. Square\nwave output frequency . Once the selection of the SQW frequency has been completed, the SQW pin can be\nturned on and off under software control with the square wave enable bit (SQWE) located in register 0Ah.\nThe SQW output is an N-channel, open drain output driver for the M41T64, and a full CMOS output driver for the\nM41T62. The initial power-up default for the SQW output is 32 kHz (except for M41T64, which defaults disabled).\nTable 7.

This function is available within one\nsecond (typ) of initial power-up and can only be disabled by setting the 32KE bit to \'0\' or the ST bit to \'1.\' If not\nused, the F 32K pin should be disconnected and allowed to float.M41T62, M41T64, M41T65\nWatchdog output (         WDO       - M41T65 only)\nDS3840  - Rev 24 page 19/42\n3.8 Century bits\nThe two century bits, CB1 and CB0, are bits D7 and D6, respectively, in the century/month register at address\n06h. Together, they comprise a 2-bit counter which increments at the turn of each century. CB1 is the most\nsignificant bit.\nThe user may arbitrarily assign the meaning of CB1:CB0 to represent any century value, but the simplest way of\nusing these bits is to extend the year register (07h) by mapping them directly to bits 9 and 8. (The reader is\nreminded that the year register is in BCD format.) Higher order year bits can be maintained in the application\nsoftware.\nFigure 21.

Examples using century bits\nCB1 CB0 CENTURY\n0 0 2000\n0 1 2100\n1 0 2200\n1 1 2300\n3.9 Leap year\nLeap year occurs every four years, in years which are multiples of 4. For example, 2012 was a leap year. An\nexception to that is any year which is a multiple of 100. For example, the year 2100 is not a leap year. A further\nexception is that years which are multiples of 400 are indeed leap years. Hence, while 2100 is not a leap year,\n2400 is.\nDuring any year which is a multiple of 4, the M41T6x RTC will automatically insert leap day, February 29.\nTherefore, the application software must correct for this during the exception years (2100, 2200, etc.) as noted\nabove.\n3.10 Output driver pin (M41T62/65)\nWhen the OFIE bit, AFE bit, and watchdog register are not set to generate an interrupt, the IRQ /OUT pin\nbecomes an output driver that reflects the contents of D7 of the calibration register. In other words, when D7\n(OUT bit) is a \'0,\' then the IRQ /OUT pin will be driven low.\nNote: The IRQ /OUT pin is an open drain which requires an external pull-up resistor.M41T62, M41T64, M41T65\nCentury bits\nDS3840  - Rev 24 page 20/42\n3.11 Oscillator stop detection\nIf the oscillator fail (OF) bit is internally set to a \'1,\' this indicates that the oscillator has either stopped, or was\nstopped for some period of time and can be used to judge the validity of the clock and date data. This bit will be\nset to \'1\' any time the oscillator stops.\nIn the event the OF bit is found to be set to \'1\' at any time other than the initial power-up, the STOP bit (ST)\nshould be written to a \'1,\' then immediately reset to \'0.\' This will restart the oscillator.\nThe following conditions can cause the OF bit to be set:\n• The first time power is applied (defaults to a \'1\' on power-up).\nNote: If the OF bit cannot be written to \'0\' four (4) seconds after the initial power-up, the STOP bit (ST) should be\nwritten to a \'1,\' then immediately reset to \'0.\'\n• The voltage present on V CC or battery is insufficient to support oscillation.\n• The ST bit is set to \'1.\'\n• External interference of the crystal\nIf the oscillator fail interrupt enable bit (OFIE) is set to a \'1,\' the IRQ pin will also be activated. The IRQ output is\ncleared by resetting the OFIE or OF bit to \'0\' (NOT by reading the flag register).\nThe OF bit will remain set to \'1\' until written to logic \'0.\' The oscillator must start and have run for at least 4\nseconds before attempting to reset the OF bit to \'0.\' If the trigger event occurs during a power-down condition, this\nbit will be set correctly.\n3.12 Initial power-on defaults\nUpon application of power to the device, the register bits will initially power-on in the state indicated in\nTable 9.
