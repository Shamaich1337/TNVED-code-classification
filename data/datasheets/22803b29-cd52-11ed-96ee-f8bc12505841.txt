The DS18S20\ncommunicates over a 1-Wire bus th at by definition requires only one data line (and ground) for\ncommunication with a central microprocessor. It ha s an operating temperature range of –55°C to +125°C\nand is accurate to /g1770.5/g176C over the range of –10°C to +85°C. In addition, the DS18S20 can derive power\ndirectly from the data line (“parasite power”), e liminating the need for an external power supply.\nEach DS18S20 has a unique 64-bit serial code, which allows multiple DS18S20s to function on the same\n1-Wire bus; thus, it is simple to  use one microprocessor to contro l many DS18S20s distributed over a\nlarge area. Applications that can benefit from th is feature include HVAC environmental controls,\ntemperature monitoring systems inside buildings, e quipment or machinery, and process monitoring and\ncontrol systems.DS18S20\nHigh-Precision\n1-Wire Digital Thermomete r\nwww. maxim -ic.com\n8-Pin 150mil SO\n(DS18S20Z)\nTO-92\n(DS18S20 )1\n(BOTTOM VIEW )23DALLAS\nDS1820\n1GND\nDQ\nVDD23NCNC\nNC\nNC\nGND DQVDDNC\n68\n7\n531\n2\n4DS1820\n1-Wire is a registered trademark of Dallas Semiconductor.\nDS18S20\n2 of 21DETAILED PIN DESCRIPTIONS  Table 1\n8-PIN SOIC* TO-92 SYMBOL DESCRIPTION\n5 1 GND Ground.\n42 D Q Data Input/Output Pin.

The 64-bit\nROM stores the device’s unique serial code. The sc ratchpad memory contains the 2-byte temperature\nregister that stores the digital output from the te mperature sensor. In add ition, the scratchpad provides\naccess to the 1-byte upper and lower alarm trigger registers (T H and T L). The T H and T L registers are\nnonvolatile (EEPROM), so they will retain data when the device is powered down.\nThe DS18S20 uses Dallas’ exclusive 1-Wire bus protocol that imple ments bus communication using one\ncontrol signal. The control line requires a weak pullup re sistor since all devices are linked to the bus via a\n3-state or open-drain port (the DQ pin in the case of  the DS18S20). In this bus system, the microprocessor\n(the master device) identifies a nd addresses devices on the bus usin g each device’s unique 64-bit code.\nBecause each device has a unique code, the number of  devices that can be addressed on one bus is\nvirtually unlimited.  The 1-Wire bus protocol, including detailed explanations of the commands and “timeslots,” is covered in the 1-WIRE BUS SYSTEM  section of this datasheet.\nAnother feature of the DS18S20 is the ability to ope rate without an external power supply. Power is\ninstead supplied through the 1-Wire pullup resistor via the DQ pin when the bus is high. The high bus\nsignal also charges an internal capacitor (C\nPP), which then supplies power to the device when the bus is\nlow. This method of deriving power from the 1-Wire  bus is referred to as “parasite power.” As an\nalternative, the DS18S20 may also be powered by an external supply on V DD.\nDS18S20 BLOCK DIAGRAM Figure 1\nVPU\n4.7K\nPOWER\nSUPPLY\nSENSE64-BIT ROM\nAND\n 1-wire PORTDQ\nVDDINTERNAL V DD\nCPPPARASITE POWER\nCIRCUITMEMORY CONTROL\nLOGIC\nSCRATCHPAD\n8-BIT CRC GENERATORTEMPERATURE SENSOR\nALARM HIGH TRIGGER (T H)\nREGISTER (EEPROM)\nALARM LOW TRIGGER (T L)\nREGISTER (EEPROM)GNDDS18S20\nDS18S20\n3 of 21OPERATION — MEASURING TEMPERATURE\nThe core functionality of the DS18S20 is its direct-t o-digital temperature sens or. The temperature sensor\noutput has 9-bit resolution, which corresponds to 0.5 /g176C steps. The DS18S20 powers-up in a low-power\nidle state; to initiate a temperature measurement a nd A-to-D conversion, the master must issue a Convert\nT [44h] command. Following the conversion, the resu lting thermal data is stored in the 2-byte\ntemperature register in the scratchpad memory and the DS18S20 returns to its idle state. If the DS18S20is powered by an external supply, the ma ster can issue “read-time slots” (see the 1-WIRE BUS SYSTEM\nsection) after the Convert T command and the DS18S20 will respond by transmitting 0 while the\ntemperature conversion is in progress and 1 when th e conversion is done. If the DS18S20 is powered with\nparasite power, this notification t echnique cannot be used since the bus  must be pulled high by a strong\npullup during the entire temperature conversion. The bus  requirements for parasite power are explained in\ndetail in the POWERING THE DS18S20  section of this datasheet.\nThe DS18S20 output data is calibrated in degrees ce ntigrade; for Fahrenheit a pplications, a lookup table\nor conversion routine must be use d. The temperature data is stored  as a 16-bit sign-extended two’s\ncomplement number in the temperature register (see Figure 2). The sign bits (S) indicate if thetemperature is positive or negative: for positive numbe rs S = 0 and for negative numbers S = 1. Table 2\ngives examples of digital output data and the corresponding temperature reading.\nResolutions greater than 9 bits can be calculated  using the data from the temperature, COUNT REMAIN\nand COUNT PER °C registers in the scratchpad. Note that the COUNT PER °C register is hard-wired to\n16 (10h). After reading the scratchpad, the TEMP_ READ value is obtained by truncating the 0.5 /g176C bit\n(bit 0) from the temperature data (see Figure 2). The extended resolution temperature can then becalculated using the following equation:\nC PER COUNTREMAIN COUNTC PER COUNTREAD TEMPE TEMPERATUR_ __ _ _25.0 _/g45/g43 /g45 /g61\nAdditional information about high-resolution temperature calculations can be found in Application Note\n105: High Resolution Temperature Measurement with  Dallas Direct-to-Digital Temperature Sensors.\nTEMPERATURE REGISTER FORMAT Figure 2\nbit 7 bit 6 bit 5 bit 4 bit 3 bit 2 bit 1 bit 0\nLS Byte 262524232221202-1\nbit 15 bit 14 bit 13 bit 12 bit 11 bit 10 bit 9 bit 8\nMS Byte SSSSSSSS\nTEMPERATURE/DATA RELATIONSHIP Table 2\nTEMPERATURE DIGITAL OUTPUT\n(Binary)DIGITAL OUTPUT\n(Hex)\n+85.0°C* 0000 0000 1010 1010 00AAh\n+25.0°C 0000 0000 0011 0010 0032h\n+0.5°C 0000 0000 0000 0001 0001h\n0°C 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000h\n-0.5°C 1111 1111 1111 1111 FFFFh\n-25.0°C 1111 1111 1100 1110 FFCEh\n-55.0°C 1111 1111 1001 0010 FF92h\n*The power-on reset value of the temperature register is +85°C\nDS18S20\n4 of 21OPERATION — ALARM SIGNALING\nAfter the DS18S20 performs a temperature conversion, the temperature value is compared to the user-\ndefined two’s complement alarm trigge r values stored in the 1-byte T H and T L registers (see Figure 3).\nThe sign bit (S)  indicates if the value is positive or negative: for positive numbers S = 0 and for negative\nnumbers S = 1. The T H and T L registers are nonvolatile (EEPROM) so  they will retain data when the\ndevice is powered down. T H and T L can be accessed through bytes 2 and 3 of the scratchpad as explained\nin the MEMORY section of this datasheet.\nTH AND T L REGISTER FORMAT Figure 3\nbit 7 bit 6 bit 5 bit 4 bit 3 bit 2 bit 1 bit 0\nS26252525222120\nOnly bits 8 through 1 of the temperature register are used in the T H and T L comparison since T H and T L\nare 8-bit registers. If the measured temperature is lower than or equal to T L or higher than T H, an alarm\ncondition exists and an alarm flag is set inside th e DS18S20. This flag is updated after every temperature\nmeasurement; therefore, if the alarm condition goes away, the flag will be turned off after the next\ntemperature conversion.\nThe master device can check the alarm flag status of  all DS18S20s on the bus by issuing an Alarm Search\n[ECh] command. Any DS18S20s with a set alarm flag  will respond to the command, so the master can\ndetermine exactly which DS18S20s ha ve experienced an alarm condition. If an alarm condition exists and\nthe T H or T L settings have changed, another temperature c onversion should be done to validate the alarm\ncondition.\nPOWERING THE DS18S20\nThe DS18S20 can be powered by an external supply on the V DD pin, or it can operate in “parasite power”\nmode, which allows the DS18S20 to function without a local external supply. Parasite power is very\nuseful for applications that require remote temperat ure sensing or that are very space constrained. Figure\n1 shows the DS18S20’s parasite-power  control circuitry, which “steals” power from the 1-Wire bus via\nthe DQ pin when the bus is high. The stolen charge  powers the DS18S20 while the bus is high, and some\nof the charge is stored on the parasite power capacitor (C PP) to provide power when the bus is low.  When\nthe DS18S20 is used in parasite power mode, the V DD pin must be connected to ground.\nIn parasite power mode, the 1-Wire bus and C PP can provide sufficient current to the DS18S20 for most\noperations as long as the specified timing and voltage requirements are met (refer to the DC\nELECTRICAL CH ARACTERISTICS and the AC ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS  sections of this data\nsheet). However, when the DS18S20 is performing te mperature conversions or copying data from the\nscratchpad memory to EEPROM, the operating current can be as high as 1.5mA. This current can cause\nan unacceptable voltage drop across the weak 1-Wire pullup resistor and is more current than can be\nsupplied by C PP. To assure that the DS18S20 has sufficient supply current, it is necessary to provide a\nstrong pullup on the 1-Wire bus whenever temperatur e conversions are taking place or data is being\ncopied from the scratchpad to EEPROM. This can be accomplished by using a MOSFET to pull the busdirectly to the rail as shown in Figure 4. The 1-Wi re bus must be switched to the strong pullup within\n10/g109s (max) after a Convert T [44h] or Copy Scratc hpad [48h] command is issued, and the bus must be\nheld high by the pullup for the duration of the conversion (t\nconv) or data transfer (t wr = 10ms). No other\nactivity can take place on the 1-Wire bus while the pullup is enabled.\nThe DS18S20 can also be powered by the conventiona l method of connecting an external power supply to\nthe V DD pin, as shown in Figure 5. The advantage of this method is that the MOSFET pullup is not\nrequired, and the 1-Wire bus is free to carry ot her traffic during the temperature conversion time.\nDS18S20\n5 of 21The use of parasite power is not recommended for temperatures above 100 /g176C since the DS18S20 may not\nbe able to sustain communications due to the higher leakage currents that can exist at these temperatures.For applications in which such temperatures are likely, it is strongly recommended that the DS18S20 bepowered by an external power supply.\nIn some situations the bus master may not know whether the DS18S20s on the bus are parasite powered\nor powered by external supplies. The master needs this information to determine if the strong bus pullupshould be used during temperature conversions. To get this information, the master can issue a Skip ROM\n[CCh] command followed by a Read Power Supply [B4h] command followed by a “read-time slot”.\nDuring the read-time slot, parasite powered DS18S20s will pull the bus low, and externally poweredDS18S20s will let the bus remain high. If the bus is pulled low, the master knows that it must supply the\nstrong pullup on the 1-Wire bus during temperature conversions.\nSUPPLYING THE PARASITE-POWER ED DS18S20 DURING TEMPERATURE\nCONVERSIONS Figure 4\nPOWERING THE DS18S20 WITH AN EXTERNAL SUPPLY Figure 5\n64-BIT LASERED ROM CODE\nEach DS18S20 contains a unique 64-bit co de (see Figure 6) stored in ROM. The least significant 8 bits of\nthe ROM code contain the DS18S20’ s 1-Wire family code: 10h. The next  48 bits contain a unique serial\nnumber. The most significant 8 bits contain a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) byte that is calculated fromthe first 56 bits of the ROM code. A detailed explanation of the CRC bits is provided in the CRC\nGENERATION section. The 64-bit ROM code and associat ed ROM function control logic allow the\nDS18S20 to operate as a 1-Wire device using the protocol detailed in the 1-WIRE BUS SYSTEM  section\nof this datasheet.\n64-BIT LASERED ROM CODE Figure 6\n8-BIT CRC 48-BIT SERIAL NUMBER 8-BIT FAMILY CODE (10h)\nMSB MSB LSB LSB LSB MSBVDD (External Supply) DS18S20\nGND VDD DQVPU\n4.7k\nTo Other\n1-Wire Devices1-Wire BusMicro-\nprocessorVPU\nVPU\n4.7k\n1-Wire BusMicro-\nprocessorDS18S20\nGND VDD DQ\nTo Other\n1-Wire Devices\nDS18S20\n6 of 21MEMORY\nThe DS18S20’s memory is organized as shown in  Figure 7. The memory consists of an SRAM\nscratchpad with nonvola tile EEPROM storage for the high a nd low alarm trigger registers (T H and T L).\nNote that if the DS18S20 alar m function is not used, the T H and T L registers can serve as general-purpose\nmemory. All memory commands are described in detail in the DS18S20 FUNCTION COMMANDS\nsection.\nByte 0 and byte 1 of the scratchpad contain the LSB and the MSB of the temperature register,\nrespectively. These bytes are read-only. Bytes 2 and 3 provide access to T H and T L registers. Bytes 4 and\n5 are reserved for internal use by the device and cannot  be overwritten; these byte s will return all 1s when\nread. Bytes 6 and 7 contain the COUNT REMAIN and COUNT PER ºC registers, which can be used to\ncalculate extended resolution results as explained in the OPERATION — MEASURING TEMPERATURE\nsection.\nByte 8 of the scratchpad is read-only and contains the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code for bytes 0\nthrough 7 of the scratchpad. The DS18S20 generates this CRC using the method described in the CRC\nGENERATION section.\nData is written to bytes 2 and 3 of the scratchpad using the Write Scratchpad [4Eh] command; the data\nmust be transmitted to the DS18S20 starting with the least significant bit of byte 2. To verify dataintegrity, the scratchpad can be read (using the Read Scratchpad [BEh] command) after the data iswritten. When reading the scratchpad, data is transf erred over the 1-Wire bus starting with the least\nsignificant bit of byte 0. To transfer the T\nH and T L data from the scratchpad to EEPROM, the master must\nissue the Copy Scratchpad [48h] command.\nData in the EEPROM registers is retained when the device is powered down; at power-up the EEPROM\ndata is reloaded into the corresponding scratchpad locations. Data can also be reloaded from EEPROM to\nthe scratchpad at any time using the Recall E2 [B8h] command. The master can issue “read-time slots”\n(see the 1-WIRE BUS SYSTEM  section) following the Recall E2 command and the DS18S20 will indicate\nthe status of the recall by transmitting 0 while the recall is in progress and 1 when the recall is done.\nDS18S20 MEMORY MAP Figure 7\nSCRATCHPAD (Power-up State)\nbyte 0 Temperature LSB (AAh)\nbyte 1 Temperature MSB (00h) EEPROM\nbyte 2 T H Register or User Byte 1* T H Register or User Byte 1\nbyte 3 T L Register or User Byte 2* T L Register or User Byte 2\nbyte 4 Reserved (FFh)\nbyte 5 Reserved (FFh)\nbyte 6 COUNT REMAIN (0Ch)\nbyte 7 COUNT PER °C  (10h)\nbyte 8 CRC*\n*Power-up state depends on value(s) stored\n in EEPROM(85°C)\nDS18S20\n7 of 21CRC GENERATION\nCRC bytes are provided as part of the DS18S20’s 64-bit ROM code and in the 9th byte of the scratchpad\nmemory. The ROM code CRC is calculated from the first 56 bits of the ROM code and is contained in themost significant byte of the ROM. The scratchpad CRC is calculated from the data stored in thescratchpad, and therefore it changes when the data in the scratchpad changes. The CRCs provide the busmaster with a method of data valid ation when data is read from the DS18S20.  To verify that data has\nbeen read correctly, the bus master must re-calculate the CRC from the received data and then comparethis value to either the ROM code CRC (for ROM reads) or to the scratchpad CRC (for scratchpad reads).If the calculated CRC matches the read CRC, the data has been received error free. The comparison ofCRC values and the decision to continue with an operation are determined entirely by the bus master.There is no circuitry inside the DS18S20 that pr events a command sequence from proceeding if the\nDS18S20 CRC (ROM or scratchpad) does not match the value generated by the bus master.\nThe equivalent polynomial function of the CRC (ROM or scratchpad) is:\nCRC = X\n8 + X5 + X4 + 1\nThe bus master can re-calculate the CRC and compare it to the CRC values from the DS18S20 using the\npolynomial generator shown in Figure 8. This circuit c onsists of a shift register and XOR gates, and the\nshift register bits are initialized to 0. Starting with th e least significant bit of the ROM code or the least\nsignificant bit of byte 0 in the sc ratchpad, one bit at a time should shif ted into the shift register. After\nshifting in the 56th bit from the ROM or the most significant bit of byte 7 from the scratchpad, the\npolynomial generator will contain the re-calculated CRC. Next, the 8-bit ROM code or scratchpad CRCfrom the DS18S20 must be shifted into the circuit. At this point, if the re-calculated CRC was correct, theshift register will contain all 0s. Additional information about the Da llas 1-Wire cyclic  redundancy check\nis available in Application Note 27: Understanding and Usi ng Cyclic Redundancy Checks with Dallas\nSemiconductor Touch Memory Products.\nCRC GENERATOR Figure 8\n(MSB) (LSB)XOR XOR XORINPUT\nDS18S20\n8 of 211-WIRE BUS SYSTEM\nThe 1-Wire bus system uses a single bus master to control one or more slave devices. The DS18S20 is\nalways a slave. When there is only one slave on the bus, the system is referred to as a “single-drop”system; the system is “multidrop” if there are multiple slaves on the bus.\nAll data and commands are transmitted least significant bit first over the 1-Wire bus.The following discussion of the 1-Wire bus syst em is broken down into three topics: hardware\nconfiguration, transaction se quence, and 1-Wire signaling (signal types and timing).\nHARDWARE CONFIGURATION\nThe 1-Wire bus has by definition only a single data lin e. Each device (master or slave) interfaces to the\ndata line via an open drain or 3-state port. This allows each device to “release” the data line when thedevice is not transmitting data so the bus is available for use by another device. The 1-Wire port of theDS18S20 (the DQ pin) is open drain with an internal  circuit equivalent to that shown in Figure 9.\nThe 1-Wire bus requires an external pullup resistor of  approximately 5k /g87; thus, the idle state for the 1-\nWire bus is high. If for any reason a transaction need s to be suspended, the bus MUST be left in the idle\nstate if the transaction is to resume. Infinite recovery time can occur between bits so long as the 1-Wire\nbus is in the inactive (high) state during the recove ry period. If the bus is held low for more than 480 /g109s,\nall components on the bus will be reset.\nHARDWARE CONFIGURATION Figure  9\nTRANSACTION SEQUENCE\nThe transaction sequence for acce ssing the DS18S20 is as follows:\nStep 1. InitializationStep 2. ROM Command (followed by any required data exchange)Step 3. DS18S20 Function Command (followed by any required data exchange)It is very important to follow this sequence every time the DS18S20 is accessed, as the DS18S20 will not\nrespond if any steps in the sequence are missing or out  of order. Exceptions to this rule are the Search\nROM [F0h] and Alarm Search [ECh] commands. After issuing either of these ROM commands, themaster must return to Step 1 in the sequence.

The initialization sequence\nconsists of a reset pulse transmitted by the bus master followed by presence pulse(s) transmitted by theslave(s). The presence pulse lets the bus master know that slave devices (such as the DS18S20) are on the\nbus and are ready to operate. Timing for the reset and presence pulses is detailed in the1-WIRE SIGNALING  section.\nROM COMMANDS\nAfter the bus master has detected a presen ce pulse, it can issue a ROM command. These commands\noperate on the unique 64-bit ROM codes of each slave device and allow the master to single out a specific\ndevice if many are present on the 1-Wire bus. These commands also allow the master to determine howmany and what types of devices are present on the bus or if any device has experienced an alarmcondition. There are five ROM commands, and each co mmand is 8 bits long.  The master device must\nissue an appropriate ROM command before issu ing a DS18S20 function command. A flowchart for\noperation of the ROM commands is shown in Figure 14.\nSEARCH ROM [F0h]\nWhen a system is initially powered up, the master mu st identify the ROM codes of all slave devices on\nthe bus, which allows the master to determine the number of slaves and their device types. The masterlearns the ROM codes through a process of elimination that requires the master to perform a Search ROMcycle (i.e., Search ROM command followed by data exchange) as many times as necessary to identify allof the slave devices. If there is only one slave on the bus, the simpler Read ROM command (see below)\ncan be used in place of the Search ROM process. For a detailed explanation of the Search ROMprocedure, refer to the  iButton\n® Book of Standards at www.ibutton.com/ibuttons/standard.pdf . After\nevery Search ROM cycle, the bus master must return to Step 1 (Initialization) in the transaction sequence.\nREAD ROM [33h]\nThis command can only be used when there is one slav e on the bus. It allows the bus master to read the\nslave’s 64-bit ROM code without using the Search ROM procedure.  If this command is used when there\nis more than one slave present on the bus, a data collision will occur when all the slaves attempt torespond at the same time.\nMATCH ROM [55h]\nThe match ROM command followed by a 64-bit ROM code  sequence allows the bus master to address a\nspecific slave device on a multidrop or single-drop bus. Only the slave that exactly matches the 64-bitROM code sequence will respond to th e function command issued by the master; all other slaves on the\nbus will wait for a reset pulse.\nSKIP ROM [CCh]\nThe master can use this command to address all de vices on the bus simultaneously without sending out\nany ROM code information. For example, the ma ster can make all DS18S20s on the bus perform\nsimultaneous temperature conversions by issuing a Skip ROM command followed by a Convert T [44h]\ncommand.\nNote that the Read Scratchpad [BEh] command can follow the Skip ROM command only if there is a\nsingle slave device on the bus. In this case time is saved by allowing the master to read from the slavewithout sending the device’s 64-bit ROM code. A Skip ROM command followed by a Read Scratchpad\ncommand will cause a data collision on the bus if there is more than one slave since multiple devices willattempt to transmit data simultaneously.\niButton is a registered trademark of Dallas Semiconductor.\nDS18S20\n10 of 21ALARM SEARCH [ECh]\nThe operation of this command is identical to the operation of the Search ROM command except that\nonly slaves with a set alarm flag will respond. This command allows the master device to determine if\nany DS18S20s experienced an alarm condition during the most recent temperature conversion. After\nevery Alarm Search cycle (i.e., Alarm Search command followed by data exchange), the bus master mustreturn to Step 1 (Initialization) in the transaction sequence. Refer to the OPERATION — ALARM\nSIGNALING  section for an explanati on of alarm flag operation.\nDS18S20 FUNCTION COMMANDS\nAfter the bus master has used a ROM command to address the DS18S20 with which it wishes to\ncommunicate, the master can issue one of the DS18S20 function commands. These commands allow the\nmaster to write to and read from the DS18S20’s sc ratchpad memory, initiate te mperature conversions and\ndetermine the power supply mode. The DS18S20 func tion commands, which are described below, are\nsummarized in Table 4 and illustrated by the flowchart in Figure 15.\nCONVERT T [44h]\nThis command initiates a single te mperature conversion. Following th e conversion, the resulting thermal\ndata is stored in the 2-byte temperature register in the scratchpad memory and the DS18S20 returns to its\nlow-power idle state. If the device is being used in parasite power mode, within 10 /g109s (max) after this\ncommand is issued the master must enable a str ong pullup on the 1-Wire bus for the duration of the\nconversion (t conv) as described in the POWERING THE DS18S20  section. If the DS18S20 is powered by\nan external supply, the master can issue read- time slots after the Convert  T command and the DS18S20\nwill respond by transmitting 0 while the temperature c onversion is in progress and 1 when the conversion\nis done. In parasite power mode this  notification technique cannot be us ed since the bus is pulled high by\nthe strong pullup during the conversion.\nWRITE SCRATCHPAD [4Eh]\nThis command allows the master to write 2 bytes of data to the DS18S20’s scratchpad. The first byte is\nwritten into the T H register (byte 2 of the scratchpad), and the second byte is written into the T L register\n(byte 3 of the scratchpad). Data must be transmitted least significant bit first. Both bytes MUST bewritten before the master issues a reset, or the data may be corrupted.\nREAD SCRATCHPAD [BEh]\nThis command allows the master to read the contents of the scratchpad.  The data transfer starts with the\nleast significant bit of byte 0 and continues through the scratchpad until the 9\nth byte (byte 8 – CRC) is\nread. The master may issue a reset to terminate reading at any time if only part of the scratchpad data isneeded.\nCOPY SCRATCHPAD [48h]\nThis command copies the cont ents of the scratchpad T\nH and T L registers (bytes 2 and 3) to EEPROM. If\nthe device is being used in pa rasite power mode, within 10 /g109s (max) after this command is issued the\nmaster must enable a strong pullup on the 1-Wi re bus for at least 10ms as described in the POWERING\nTHE DS18S20  section.\nRECALL E2 [B8h]\nThis command recalls the alarm trigger values (T H and T L) from EEPROM and places the data in bytes 2\nand 3, respectively, in the scratchpad memory. The master device can issue read-time slots following theRecall E\n2 command and the DS18S20 will indi cate the status of the recall by transmitting 0 while the\nrecall is in progress and 1 when the recall is done. The recall operation happens automatically at power-\nup, so valid data is available in the scratchpad as soon as power is applied to the device.\nDS18S20\n11 of 21READ POWER SUPPLY [B4h]\nThe master device issues this command followed by a read-time slot to determine if any DS18S20s on the\nbus are using parasite power. During the read-time slot, parasite powered DS18S20s will pull the bus low,and externally powered DS18S20s will let the bus remain high. Refer to the POWERING THE DS18S20\nsection for usage information for this command.\nDS18S20 FUNCTION COMMAND SET Table 4\nCommand Description Protocol1-Wire Bus Activity\nAfter Command is Issued Notes\nTEMPERATURE CONVERSION COMMANDS\nConvert T Initiates temperature\nconversion.44h DS18S20 transmits conversion\nstatus to master (not applicablefor parasite-powered DS18S20s).1\nMEMORY COMMANDS\nRead Scratchpad Reads the entire scratchpad\nincluding the CRC byte.BEh DS18S20 transmits up to 9 data\nbytes to master.2\nWrite Scratchpad Writes data into scratchpad\nbytes 2 and 3 (T H and T L).4Eh Master transmits 2 data bytes to\nDS18S20.3\nCopy Scratchpad Copies T H and T L data from\nthe scratchpad to EEPROM.48h None 1\nRecall E2Recalls T H and T L data from\nEEPROM to the scratchpad.B8h DS18S20 transmits recall status\nto master.\nRead PowerSupplySignals DS18S20 power\nsupply mode to the master.B4h DS18S20 transmits supply status\nto master.\nNOTES:\n1) For parasite-powered DS18S20s, the master must enable a strong pullup on the 1-Wire bus during\ntemperature conversions and copies from the scra tchpad to EEPROM. No other bus activity may take\nplace during this time.\n2) The master can interrupt the transmission of data at any time by issuing a reset.\n3) Both bytes must be written before a reset is issued.\nDS18S20\n12 of 211-WIRE SIGNALING\nThe DS18S20 uses a strict 1- Wire communication protocol to insure data integrity. Several signal types\nare defined by this protocol: reset pulse, presence pul se, write 0, write 1, read 0, and read 1. All of these\nsignals, with the exception of the presence pulse, are initiated by the bus master.\nINITIALIZATION PROCEDURE: RESET AND PRESENCE PULSES\nAll communication with the DS18S20 begins with an initialization sequence that consists of a reset pulsefrom the master followed by a presence pulse from  the DS18S20. This is illustrated in Figure 10. When\nthe DS18S20 sends the presence pulse in  response to the reset, it is indicating to the master that it is on\nthe bus and ready to operate.\nDuring the initialization sequence the bus master transmits (T\nX) the reset pulse by pulling the 1-Wire bus\nlow for a minimum of 480 /g109s. The bus master then releases the bus and goes into receive mode (R X).\nWhen the bus is released, the 5k pullup resistor pu lls the 1-Wire bus high. When the DS18S20 detects\nthis rising edge, it waits 15 /g109s to 60 /g109s and then transmits a presence pulse by pulling the 1-Wire bus low\nfor 60 /g109s to 240 /g109s.\nINITIALIZATION TIMING Figure 10\nREAD/WRITE TIME SLOTS\nThe bus master writes data to the DS18S20 during write time slots and reads data from the DS18S20\nduring read-time slots. One bit of data is transmitted over the 1-Wire bus per time slot.\nWRITE TIME SLOTS\nThere are two types of write time slots: “Write 1” time slots and “Write 0” time slots. The bus masteruses a Write 1 time slot to write a logic 1 to the DS18S20 and a Write 0 time slot to write a logic 0 to the\nDS18S20. All write time slots must be a minimum of 60 /g109s in duration with a minimum of a 1 /g109s recovery\ntime between individual write slots. Both types of write time slots are initiated by the master pulling the\n1-Wire bus low (see Figure 11).\nTo generate a Write 1 time slot, after pulling the 1-Wire bus low, the bus master must release the 1-Wire\nbus within 15 /g109s. When the bus is released, the 5k pullup resistor will pull the bus high. To generate a\nWrite 0 time slot, after pulling the 1-Wire bus low, the bus master must continue to hold the bus low for\nthe duration of the time slot (at least 60 /g109s). The DS18S20 samples the 1-Wire bus during a window that\nlasts from 15 /g109s to 60 /g109s after the master initiates the write time slot. If the bus is high during the sampling\nwindow, a 1 is written to the DS18S20. If the line is low, a 0 is written to the DS18S20.LINE TYPE LEGEND\nBus master pulling low\nDS18S20 pulling lowResistor \npullupVPU\nGND1-WIRE BUS480/g109s minimum 480/g109s minimum\nDS18S20 T X\npresence pulse\n60-240 /g109sMASTER T X RESET PULSE MASTER RX\nDS18S20\n waits 15-60 /g109s\nDS18S20\n13 of 21READ-TIME SLOTS\nThe DS18S20 can only transmit data to the master when the master issues read-time slots. Therefore, the\nmaster must generate read-time slots immediately after issuing a Read Scratchpad [BEh] or Read PowerSupply [B4h] command, so that the DS18S20 can provide  the requested data. In addition, the master can\ngenerate read-time slots after i ssuing Convert T [44h] or Recall E\n2 [B8h] commands to find out the status\nof the operation as explained in the DS18S20 FUNCTION COMMAND section.\nAll read-time slots must be a minimum of 60 /g109s in duration with a minimum of a 1 /g109s recovery time\nbetween slots. A read-time slot is initiated by the master device pulling the 1-Wire bus low for a\nminimum of 1 /g109s and then releasing the bus (see Figure 11). After the master initiates the read-time slot,\nthe DS18S20 will begin transmitting a 1 or 0 on bus. The DS18S20 transmits a 1 by leaving the bus highand transmits a 0 by pulling the bus low. When transmitting a 0, the DS18S20 will release the bus by theend of the time slot, and the bus will be pulled back to its high idle state by the pullup resister. Output\ndata from the DS18S20 is valid for 15 /g109s after the falling edge that initiated the read-time slot. Therefore,\nthe master must release the bus and then sample the bus state within 15 /g109s from the start of the slot.\nFigure 12 illustrates that the sum of T\nINIT, TRC, and T SAMPLE  must be less than 15 /g109s for a read-time slot.\nFigure 13 shows that system timing margin is maximized by keeping T INIT  and T RC as short as possible\nand by locating the master sample time during read-time slots towards the end of the 15 /g109s period.\nREAD/WRITE TIME SLOT TIMING DIAGRAM Figure 11\n45/g109s 15/g109s\nVPU\nGND1-WIRE BUS60/g109s < T X “0” < 120 /g109s1/g109s < T REC < /g165\nDS18S20  Samples\nMIN              TYP                         MA X\n15/g109s 30/g109s> 1/g109sMASTER WRITE “0” SLOT MASTER WRITE “1” SLOT\nVPU\nGND1-WIRE BUS\n15/g109sMASTER READ “0” SLOT MASTER READ “1” SLOT\nMaster samples Master samplesSTART\nOF SLOTSTART\nOF SLOT\n> 1 /g109s1/g109s < T REC < /g16515/g109s 15/g109s 30/g109s 15/g109sDS18S20  Samples\nMIN              TYP                         MA X\n> 1/g109s\nLINE TYPE LEGEND\nBus master pulling low DS18S20 pulling low\nResistor pullup\nDS18S20\n14 of 21DETAILED MASTER READ 1 TIMING Figure 12\nRECOMMENDED MASTER READ 1 TIMING  Figure 13VPU\nGND1-WIRE BUS\n15/g109sVIH of Master\nTRC TINT > 1/g109s Master samples\nLINE TYPE LEGEND\nBus master pulling low\nResistor pullupVPU\nGND1-WIRE BUS\n15/g109sVIH of Master\nTRC =\nsmallTINT =\nsmallMaster samples\nDS18S20\n15 of 21ROM COMMANDS FLOW CHART Figure 14\nCCh\nSKIP ROM\nCOMMANDMASTER T X\nRESET PULSE\nDS18S20 T X\nPRESENCE\nPULSE\nMASTER T X ROM\nCOMMAND\n33h\nREAD ROM\nCOMMAND55h\nMATCH ROM\nCOMMANDF0h\nSEARCH ROM\nCOMMANDECh\nALARM SEARCH\nCOMMAND\nMASTER T X\nBIT 0\nDS18S20 T X BIT 0\nDS18S20 T X BIT 0\nMASTER T X BIT 0\nBIT 0\nMAT CH?\nMASTER T X\nBIT 1\nBIT 1\nMATCH?\nBIT 63\nMAT CH?MASTER T X\nBIT 63N\nY YY Y YNN N N\nN\nN\nNY\nY\nYDS18S20 T X BIT 1\nDS18S20 T X BIT 1\nMASTER T X BIT 1\nDS18S20 T X BIT 63\n DS18S20 T X BIT 63\nMASTER T X BIT 63BIT 0\nMAT CH?\nBIT 1\nMATCH?\nBIT 63\nMATCH?N\nN\nNY\nY\nYDS18S20 T X\nFAMILY CODE\n1 BYTE\nDS18S20 T X\nSERIAL NUMBER\n6 BYTES\nDS18S20 T X\nCRC BYTEDS18S20 T X BIT 0\nDS18S20 T X BIT 0\nMASTER T X BIT 0\nN\nYDEVICE(S)\nWITH ALARM\nFLAG SET?Initialization\nSequence\nMASTER T X\nFUNCTION\nCOMMAND\n(FIGURE 15)\nDS18S20\n16 of 21DS18S20 FUNCTION COMMANDS FLOW CHART Figure 15\nMASTER T X\nFUNCTION\nCOMMAND\nYN44h\nCONVERT\nTEMPERATURE\n?\nPARASITE\nPOWER\n?N Y\nDS18S20 BEGINS\nCONVERSION\nDEVICE\nCONVERTING\nTEMPERATURE\n?N\nY\nMASTER\nRX “0s”MASTER\nRX “1s”MASTER ENABLES\nSTRONG PULLUP ON DQ\nDS18S20 CONVERTS\nTEMPERATURE\nMASTER DISABLES\nSTRONG PULLUPYN48h\nCOPY\nSCRATCHPAD\n?\nPARASITE\nPOWER\n?N Y\nMASTER ENABLES\nSTRONG PULL-UP ON DQ\nDATA COPIED FROM\nSCRATCHPAD TO EEPROM\nMASTER DISABLES\nSTRONG PULLUP\nMASTER\nRX “0s”COPY IN\nPROGRESS\n?\nY\nMASTER\nRX “1s”N\nRETURN TO INITIALIZATION\nSEQUENCE (FIGURE 14) FOR\nNEXT TRANSACTIONB4h\nREAD\nPOWER SUPPLY\n?\nYN\nPARASITE\nPOWERED\n?N\nMASTER\nRX “1s”MASTER\nRX “0s”YMASTER T X TH BYTE\nTO SCRATCHPADYN4Eh\nWRITE\nSCRATCHPAD\n?\nMASTER T X TL BYTE\nTO SCRATCHPADY\nN\nYBEh\nREAD\nSCRATCHPAD\n?\nHAVE 8 BYTES\nBEEN READ\n?N\nMASTER\nTX RESET\n?MASTER R X DATA BYTE\nFROM SCRATCHPAD\nNY\nMASTER R X SCRATCHPAD\nCRC BYTEMASTER\nRX “1s”YN B8h\nRECALL E2\n?\nMASTER BEGINS DATA\nRECALL FROM E2 PROM\nDEVICE\nBUSY RECALLING\nDATA\n?N\nY\nMASTER\nRX “0s”\nDS18S20\n17 of 21DS18S20 OPERATION EXAMPLE 1\nIn this example there are multiple DS18S20s on the bus and they are using parasite power.
