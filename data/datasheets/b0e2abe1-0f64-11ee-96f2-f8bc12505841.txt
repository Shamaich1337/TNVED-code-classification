Their on-chip output amplifiers \nallow rail-to-rail output swing to be achieved with a slew rate of \n0.7 V/μs. A 3-wire serial interface is used; it operates at clock rates up to 30 MHz and is compatible with standard SPI, QSPI, MICROWIRE, and DSP interface standards. \nThe references for the four DACs are derived from one reference \npin. The outputs of all DACs can be updated simultaneously using \nthe software LDAC\n function. The parts incorporate a power-on \nreset circuit, and ensure that the DAC outputs power up to 0 V \nand remains there until a valid write takes place to the device. \nThe parts contain a power-down feature that reduces the current \nconsumption of the device to 200 nA @ 5 V (80 nA @ 3 V). \nThe low power consumption of these parts in normal operation \nmakes them ideally suited to portable battery-operated equipment. The power consumption is 3 mW at 5 V , 1.5 mW at 3 V , reducing to 1 μW in power-down mode.  \n   \n \n1 Protected by U.S. Patent No. 5,969,657. \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM \nINPUT\nREGISTERDAC\nREGISTERSTRING\nDAC AVOUTABUFFER\nINPUT\nREGISTERDAC\nREGISTERSTRING\nDAC BVOUTBBUFFERAD5304/AD5314/AD5324\nINPUT\nREGISTERDAC\nREGISTERSTRING\nDAC CVOUTCBUFFER\nINPUT\nREGISTERDAC\nREGISTERSTRING\nDAC DVOUTDBUFFERREFIN VDD\nGNDPOWER-DOWN LOGIC POWER-ON RESETLDACINTERFACE\nLOGICSCLK\nSYNC\nDIN\n00929-001 \nFigure 1. \nAD5304/ AD5314/ AD5324 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

J | Page 12 of 24 TERMINOLOGY  \nRelative Accuracy  or Integral Nonl inearity (INL)  \nFor the DAC, relative accuracy or integral nonlinearity (INL)  \nis a measure of the maximum deviation, in LSB, from a straight \nline passing through the endpoints of the DAC transfer function.  \nTypical INL vs . code plots can be seen in Figure 5, Figure 6,  \nand Figure 7. \nDifferential Nonlinearity  \nDifferential nonlinearity (DNL) is the difference between the \nmeasured change and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ± 1 LSB \nmaximum ensures monotonicity. This DAC is guaranteed mono -\ntonic by design. Typical DNL vs.  code plots can be seen in Figure 8, \nFigure 9, and Figure 10. \nOffset Error  \nThis is a measure of the offset error of the DAC and the output amplifier. It is expressed as a percentage of the full -scale range.  \nGain Error  \nThis is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the deviation   \nin slope of the actual DAC transfer characteristic from the ideal expressed as a percentage of the full -scale range.  \nOffset Error Drift  \nThis is a measure of the change in offset error with changes in \ntemperature. It is expressed in (pp m of full -scale range)/ °C. \nGain Error Drift  \nThis is a measure of the change in gain error with changes in temperature. It is expressed in (ppm of full -scale range)/ °C. \nPower Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)  \nThis indicates how the output of the DAC is affected  by changes \nin the supply voltage. PSRR is the ratio of the change in V\nOUT to \na change in V DD for full -scale output of the DAC. It is measured \nin decibels . V REF is held at 2 V and V DD is varied ±10%.  \nDC Crosstalk  \nThis is the dc change in the output level o f one DAC at midscale \nin response to a full- scale code change (all 0s to all 1s and vice \nversa) and output change of another DAC. It is expressed in micro volts . \nReference Feedthrough  \nThis is the ratio of the amplitude of the signal at the DAC outpu t to \nthe reference input when the DAC output is not being updated. \nIt is expressed in d ecibels . Major -Code Transition Glitch Energy  \nMajor -code transition glitch energy is the energy of the impulse \ninjected into the analog output when the code in the DAC register  \nchanges state. It is normally specified as the area of the glitch in \nnV-s and is measured when the digital code is changed by 1  LSB \nat the major carry transition (011 . . . 11 to 100 . . . 00 or 100 . . . 00 to 011 . . . 11).  \nDigital Feedthrough  \nDigital fee dthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into the  \nanalog output of the DAC from the digital input pins of the \ndevice when the DAC output is not being written to (\nSYNC  \nheld high). It is specified in nV -s and is measured with a worst -\ncase change  on the digital input pins  (for example, from all 0s  \nto all 1s or vice versa.)  \nDigital Crosstalk  \nThis is the glitch impulse transferred to the output of one DAC \nat midscale in response to a full -scale code change (all 0s to all \n1s and vice versa ) in the input register of another DAC. It is \nexpressed in nV -s. \nDAC -to-DAC Crosstalk  \nThis is the glitch impulse transferred to the output of one DAC due to a digital code change and subsequent output change of another DAC. This includes both digital and a nalog crosstalk.  \nIt is measured by loading one of the DACs with a full -scale code  \nchange (all 0s to all 1s and vice versa) with the \nLDAC  bit set low \nand monitoring the output of another DAC. The energy of the glitch is expressed in nV -s. \nMultiplying Bandwidth  \nThe amplifiers within the DAC have a finite bandwidth. The multiplying bandwidth is a measure of this. A sine wave on the reference (with full -scale code loaded to the DAC) appears on \nthe output. The multiplying bandwidth is the freq uency at whic h \nthe output amplitude falls to 3 dB below the input.  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion  (THD) \nThis is the difference between an ideal sine wave and its attenuated  \nversion using the DAC. The sine wave is used as the reference for the DAC and the THD is  a measure of the harmonics present  on \nthe DAC output. It is measured in decibels. \nData Sheet AD5304 /AD5314/ AD5324\n \nRev.

J | Page 14 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 are quad, resistor-string DACs \nfabricated on a CMOS process with resolutions of 8, 10, and 12 bits, respectively. Each contains four output buffer amplifiers and is written to via a 3-wire serial interface. They operate from single \nsupplies of 2.5 V to 5.5 V , and the output buffer amplifiers provide \nrail-to-rail output swing with a slew rate of 0.7 V/μs. The four DACs share a single reference input pin. The devices have pro-grammable power-down modes, in which all DACs can be turned off completely with a high impedance output. \nDigital-to-Analog  \nThe architecture of one DAC channel consists of a resistor-string DAC followed by an output buffer amplifier. The voltage at the REFIN pin provides the reference voltage for the DAC. Figure 30 shows a block diagram of the DAC architecture. Since the input coding to the DAC is straight binary, the ideal output voltage is \ngiven by \nNREF\nOUTD VV2\uf0b4\uf03d  \nwhere \nD = decimal equivalent of the binary code that is loaded to the \nDAC register: \n0–255 for AD5304 (8 bits) \n0–1023 for AD5314 (10 bits)   \n0–4095 for AD5324 (12 bits)   \nN = DAC resolution. \nREFIN\nOUTPUT BUFFER\nAMPLIFIERRESISTOR\nSTRINGDAC\nREGISTERINPUT\nREGISTERVOUTA\n00929-030 \nFigure 30. DAC Channel Architecture \nResistor String \nThe resistor string section is shown in Figure 31. It is simply a string of resistors, each of value R. The digital code loaded to the DAC register determines at which node on the string the voltage is tapped off to be fed into the output amplifier. The voltage is \ntapped off by closing one of the switches connecting the string \nto the amplifier. Because it is a string of resistors, it is guaranteed monotonic. \n R\nRR\nR\nRTO OUTPUT\nAMPLIFIER\n00929-031 \nFigure 31. Resistor String \nDAC Reference Inputs \nThere is a single reference input pin for the four DACs. The \nreference input is not buffered. The user can have a reference voltage as low as 0.25 V or as high as VDD because there is no restriction due to the headroom or footroom requirements of any reference amplifier. It is recommended to use a buffered reference in the external circuit (for example, REF192). The \ninput impedance is typically 45 kΩ. \nOutput Amplifier \nThe output buffer amplifier is capable of generating rail-to-rail \nvoltages on its output, giving an output range of 0 V to V DD when \nthe reference is V DD. It is capable of driving a load of 2 kΩ to \nGND or V DD, in parallel with 500 pF to GND or V DD. The source \nand sink capabilities of the output amplifier can be seen in the plot in Figure 15. \nThe slew rate is 0.7 V/μs with a half-scale settling time to \n±0.5 LSB (at eight bits) of 6 μs. \nPOWER-ON RESET \nThe AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 are provided with a power-on reset function, so that they power up in a defined state. The power-on state uses normal operation and an output voltage set to 0 V . \nBoth input and DAC registers are filled with zeros and remain \nso until a valid write sequence is made to the device. This is particularly useful in applications where it is important to know \nthe state of the DAC outputs while the device is powering up. \nSERIAL INTERFACE \nThe AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 are controlled over a versatile, \n3-wire serial interface that operates at clock rates up to 30 MHz and are compatible with SPI, QSPI, MICROWIRE, and DSP interface standards. \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet AD5304 /AD5314/ AD5324\n \nRev.

AD5324 Input Shift Register Contents \nInput Shift Register \nThe input shift register is 16 bits wide. Data is loaded into the \ndevice as a 16-bit word under the control of a serial clock input, SCLK. See Figure 2 for the timing diagram of this operation. The 16-bit word consists of four control bits followed by 8, 10, or 12 bits of DAC data, depending on the device type. Data is loaded \nMSB first (Bit 15) and the first two bits determine whether the \ndata is for DAC A, DAC B, DAC C, or DAC D. Bit 13 and Bit 12 \ncontrol the operating mode of the DAC. Bit 13 is PD\n, and deter-\nmines whether the part is in normal or power-down mode. Bit 12 is LDAC\n, and controls when DAC registers and outputs \nare updated. \nTable 6. Address Bits \nA1  A0  DAC Addressed  \n0  0  DAC A  \n0  1  DAC B  \n1  0  DAC C  \n1  1  DAC D  \nAddress and Control Bits \nPD  0: All four DACs go into power-down mode, consuming \nonly 200 nA at 5 V . The DAC outputs enter a high \nimpedance state. \n1: Normal operation. \nLDAC   0: All four DAC registers and, therefore, all DAC outputs \nupdated simultaneously on completion of the write \nsequence. \n1: Only addressed input register is updated. There is \nno change in the content of the DAC registers. \nIt is not recommended to set the PD and LDAC  control bits \nsimultaneously. Depending on the SPI transmission rate, this causes the data transferred to be loaded into the DAC register if \nthe LDAC\n control bit was previously set. \nThe AD5324 uses all 12 bits of DAC data; the AD5314 uses 10 bits \nand ignores the 2 LSB Bits. The AD5304 uses eight bits and ignores the last four bits. The data format is straight binary, with all 0s corresponding to 0 V output and all 1s corresponding to full-scale \noutput (V\nREF − 1 LSB). \nThe SYNC  input is a level-triggered input that acts as a frame \nsynchronization signal and chip enable. Data can be transferred \ninto the device only while SYNC  is low. To start the serial data \ntransfer, take SYNC  low, observing the minimum SYNC  to SCLK \nfalling edge setup time, t 4. After SYNC  goes low, serial data shifts \ninto the device’s input shift register on the falling edges of SCLK \nfor 16 clock pulses. Any data and clock pulses after the 16th falling \nedge of SCLK are ignored because the SCLK and DIN input buffers are powered down. No further serial data transfer occurs until \nSYNC\n is taken high and low again. \nSYNC  can be taken high after the falling edge of the 16th SCLK \npulse, observing the minimum SCLK falling edge to SYNC  \nrising edge time, t 7. \nAfter the end of the serial data transfer, data automatically transfers \nfrom the input shift register to the input register of the selected \nDAC. If SYNC  is taken high before the 16th falling edge of \nSCLK, the data transfer is aborted and the DAC input registers \nare not updated. \nWhen data has been transferred into three of the DAC input \nregisters, all DAC registers and all DAC outputs are simultaneously \nupdated by setting LDAC  low when writing to the remaining \nDAC input register. \nLow Power Serial Interface \nTo reduce the power consumption of the device even further, the \ninterface fully powers up only when the device is being written \nto, that is, on the falling edge of SYNC . As soon as the 16-bit \ncontrol word has been written to the part, the SCLK and DIN \ninput buffers are powered down. They power up again only \nfollowing a falling edge of SYNC . \n \nAD5304/ AD5314/ AD5324  Data Sheet\n \nRev. J | Page 16 of 24 Double-Buffered Interface \nThe AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 DACs have double-buffered inter-\nfaces consisting of two banks of registers—input registers and \nDAC registers. The input register is directly connected to the input \nshift register and the digital code is transferred to the relevant input register on completion of a valid write sequence. The DAC register contains the digital code used by the resistor string. \nAccess to the DAC register is controlled by the LDAC\n bit. When \nthe LDAC  bit is set high, the DAC register is latched and hence \nthe input register can change state without affecting the contents \nof the DAC register. However, when the LDAC  bit is set low, all \nDAC registers are updated after a complete write sequence. \nThis is useful if the user requires simultaneous updating of all \nDAC outputs. The user can write to three of the input registers \nindividually and then, by setting the LDAC  bit low when \nwriting to the remaining DAC input register, all outputs \nupdate simultaneously. \nThese parts contain an extra feature whereby the DAC register \nis not updated unless its input register has been updated since \nthe last time that LDAC  was brought low. Normally, when LDAC  \nis brought low, the DAC registers are filled with the contents of \nthe input registers. In the case of the AD5304/AD5314/AD5324, \nthe part updates the DAC register only if the input register has \nbeen changed since the last time the DAC register was updated, thereby removing unnecessary digital crosstalk. \nPOWER-DOWN MODE \nThe AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 have low power consumption, dissipating only 1.5 mW with a 3 V supply and 3 mW with a 5 V supply. Power consumption can be further reduced when the DACs are not in use by putting them into power-down mode, \nselected by a 0 on Bit 13 ( PD\n) of the control word. \nWhen the PD bit is set to 1, all DACs work normally with a typical \npower consumption of 600 μA at 5 V (500 μA at 3 V). However, in \npower-down mode, the supply current falls to 200 nA at 5 V (80 nA at 3 V) when all DACs are powered down. Not only does the supply current drop, but also the output stage is internally \nswitched from the output of the amplifier, making it open-circuit. \nThis has the advantage that the output is three-stated while the part is in power-down mode, and provides a defined input condition for whatever is connected to the output of the DAC amplifier. The output stage is illustrated in Figure 35. The bias generator, the output amplifier, the resistor string, and all other associated linear circuitry are shut down when the power-down mode is activated. However, the contents of the registers are unaffected when in power-down. The time to exit power-down \nis typically 2.5 μs for V\nDD = 5 V and 5 μs when V DD = 3 V . This is \nthe time from the falling edge of the 16th SCLK pulse to when \nthe output voltage deviates from its power down voltage. See \nFigure 22 for a plot. \nRESISTOR\nSTRING DACAMPLIFIER\nVOUT\nPOWER-DOWN\nCIRCUITRY\n00929-035 \nFigure 35.

The ADSP-21xx is set up to operate in the SPORT transmit alternate framing mode. The ADSP-21xx sport is programmed through the SPORT control register and must be configured as follows: internal clock operation, active-low framing, and 16-bit word length. Transmission is \ninitiated by writing a word to the Tx register after the SPORT \nhas been enabled. The data is clocked out on each rising edge of the DSP’s serial clock and clocked into the AD5304/AD5314/ AD5324 on the falling edge of the DAC’s SCLK. \nAD5304/\nAD5314/\nAD5324*ADSP-21xx*\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.DIN DT\nSCLK SCLKSYNC TFS\n00929-036 \nFigure 36.

J | Page 17 of 24 AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 to 68HC11/68L11 Interface \nFigure 37 shows a serial interface between the AD5304/AD5314/ \nAD5324 and the 68HC11/68L11 microcontroller. SCK of the \n68HC11/68L11 drives the SCLK of the AD5304/AD5314/AD5324, \nwhile the MOSI output drives the serial data line (DIN) of the \nDAC. The SYNC  signal is derived from a port line (PC7). The \nsetup conditions for the correct operation of this interface are as \nfollows: the 68HC11/68L11 is configured so that its CPOL bit is a 0 and its CPHA bit is a 1. When data is being transmitted to the \nDAC, the SYNC\n line is taken low (PC7). When the 68HC11/ \n68L11 is configured as above, data appearing on the MOSI output \nis valid on the falling edge of SCK. Serial data from the 68HC11/ \n68L11 is transmitted in 8-bit bytes with only eight falling clock edges occurring in the transmit cycle. Data is transmitted MSB first. To load data to the AD5304/ AD5314/AD5324, PC7 is left low after the first eight bits are transferred, a second serial write operation is performed to the DAC, and PC7 is taken high at \nthe end of this procedure. \nAD5304/\nAD5314/\nAD5324*68HC11/68L11*\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.SCLK SCK\nDIN MOSISYNC PC7\n00929-037 \nFigure 37.

The setup for the interface is as follows: TxD of the 80C51/80L51 drives SCLK  \nof the AD5304/AD5314/AD5324, while RxD drives the serial \ndata line of the part. The SYNC\n signal is again derived from a \nbit-programmable pin on the port. In this case, port line P3.3 is \nused. When data is to be transmitted to the AD5304/AD5314/ AD5324, P3.3 is taken low. The 80C51/80L51 transmits data  only in 8-bit bytes; thus only eight falling clock edges occur in the transmit cycle. To load data to the DAC, P3.3 is left low after the first eight bits are transmitted, and a second write cycle is initiated to transmit the second byte of data. P3.3 is taken high \nfollowing the completion of this cycle. The 80C51/80L51 outputs \nthe serial data in a format that has the LSB first. The AD5304/ AD5314/AD5324 requires its data with the MSB as the first bit received. The 80C51/80L51 transmit routine takes this into account. \nAD5304/\nAD5314/\nAD5324*80C51/80L51*\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.SCLK TxD\nDIN RxDSYNC P3.3\n00929-038 \nFigure 38.

J | Page 18 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nTYPICAL APPLICATION CIRCUIT \nThe AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 can be used with a wide range \nof reference voltages where the devices offer full, one-quadrant multiplying capability over a reference range of 0 V to V\nDD. \nMore typically, these devices are used with a fixed, precision \nreference voltage. Suitable references for 5 V operation are the \nAD780 and REF192 (2.5 V references). For 2.5 V operation, a suitable external reference would be the AD589, a 1.23 V band gap reference. Figure 40 shows a typical setup for the AD5304/ AD5314/AD5324 when using an external reference. \nAD5304/AD5314/\nAD5324VDD= 2.5V TO 5.5 V\nSCLKREFIN\nDIN\nSYNCVOUTA\nVOUTB\nVOUTC\nVOUTD\nGND A0\nSERIAL\nINTERFACEVOUTVIN\nEXTERNAL\nREFERENCE\nAD790/REF192\nWITH V DD = 5V\nOR AD589 WITH\nVDD = 2.5V1µF0.1µF 10µF\n00929-040 \nFigure 40. AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 Using External Reference \nIf an output range of 0 V to V DD is required, the simplest solution is \nto connect the reference input to V DD. As this supply is not very \naccurate and can be noisy, the AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 can \nbe powered from the reference voltage; for example, using a 5 V \nreference such as the REF195. The REF195 can output a steady \nsupply voltage for the AD5304/AD5314/AD5324. The current required from the REF195 is 600 μA supply current and approxi-mately 112 μA into the reference input. This is with no load on the DAC outputs. When the DAC outputs are loaded, the REF195 \nalso needs to supply the current to the loads. The total current \nrequired (with a 10 kΩ load on each output) is \n712 μA + 4 (5 V/10 kΩ) = 2.70 mA \nThe load regulation of the REF195 is typically 2 ppm/mA, resulting \nin an error of 5.4 ppm (27 μV) for the 2.7 mA current drawn from \nit. This corresponds to a 0.0014 LSB error at eight bits and 0.022 LSB error at 12 bits. Bipolar Operation Using the AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 \nThe AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 have been designed for single supply operation, but a bipolar output range is also possible \nusing the circuit in Figure 41. This circuit gives an output voltage \nrange of ±5 V . Rail-to-rail operation at the amplifier output is achievable using an AD820 or an OP295 as the output amplifier. \nAD5304\nREFIN\nGNDVOUTA\nVOUTB\nVOUTC\nVOUTD\nSERIAL\nINTERFACEDIN SCLK SYNCVOUTVIN\nGNDREF195\n1µF0.1µF 10µF+6V TO +16V\nVDD+5V\n–5V±5V+5V\nAD820/\nOP295R1 = 10kΩR2 = 10kΩ\n00929-041 \nFigure 41.

J | Page 19 of 24 Opto-Isolated Interface for Pr ocess Control Applications \nThe AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 have a versatile 3-wire serial \ninter-face, making them ideal for generating accurate voltages \nin process control and industrial applications. Due to noise, \nsafety requirements, or distance, it might be necessary to isolate the AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 from the controller. This can easily be achieved by using opto-isolators, which provide isolation in excess of 3 kV . The actual data  rate achieved is limited by the \ntype of optocouplers chosen. The serial loading structure of the AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 makes them ideally suited for use in opto-isolated applications. Figure 42 shows an opto-isolated interface to the AD5304 where DIN, SCLK, and SYNC are driven from optocouplers. The power supply to the part also needs to \nbe isolated. This is done by using a transformer. On the DAC \nside of the transformer, a 5 V regulator provides the 5 V supply required for the AD5304. \nSCLK\nDINAD5304\nSYNC\nGND5V\nREGULATOR\nPOWER\nVDD10µF 0.1µF\nREFINVDD\n10kΩ\n10kΩ\n10kΩ\nDINSYNCSCLK\nVDD\nVDDVOUTA\nVOUTB\nVOUTC\nVOUTD\n00929-042 \nFigure 42.

In this application, all \nthe DACs in the system receive the same serial clock and serial \ndata, but SYNC  can only be active to one of the devices at any one \ntime, allowing access to four channels in this 16-channel system. \nThe 74HC139 is used as a 2-to-4-line decoder to address any of \nthe DACs in the system. To prevent timing errors, the enable input must be brought to its inactive state while the coded address inputs are changing state.

J | Page 20 of 24 POWER  SUPPLY BYPASSING  AND  GROUNDING  \nIn any circuit where accuracy is important, careful consideration  of \nthe power supply and ground return layout helps to ensure the \nrated performance. The printed circuit board on which the \nAD5304/AD5314/AD5324 is mounted is  designed so that the \nanalog and digital sections are separated and confined  to certain \nareas of the board. If the AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 are  in a \nsystem where multi ple devices require an AGND -to-DGND \nconnection, the connection is  made at one point only. The star \nground point is  established as close as possible to the device. The  \nAD5304/AD5314/AD5324 ha s ample supply bypass ing of 10 μF in \nparallel with 0.1 μF on the supply located as close  to the package as \npossible, ideally right up against the device. The 10  μF capacitors \nare the tantalum bead type. The 0.1  μF capaci tor has low effective \nseries resistance (ESR) and effecti ve series inductance (ESI), like the common ceramic types that provide a low impedance path \nto ground at high frequencies, to handle transient currents due \nto internal logic switching.  \nThe power supply lines of the AD5304/AD5314/AD5324 use as large a trace  as possible to provide low impedance paths and \nreduce  the effects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast \nswitching signals such as clocks are shielded with digital ground  to \navoid radiating noise to other parts of the board, and are  never \nrun near the  reference inputs . Avoid crossover of digital  and \nanalog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the board run at right angles to each other. This reduces the effects of feedthrough through the board. A microstrip technique is by far the best, but is not alwa ys possible with a double -sided board. In this \ntechnique, the component side of the board is dedicated to a \nground plane while signal traces are placed on the solder side . \nTable 7.
