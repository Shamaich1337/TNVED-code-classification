Designed to meet \nthe needs of high performance, portable instrumentation, the AD8220- EP has a minimum common -mode rejection ratio \n(CMRR) of 77 dB at dc and a minimum CMRR of 72 dB at 5  kHz \nfor G = 1. Maximum input bias current at 25 °C is 25  pA and \nremains below 100 nA over the en tire extended industrial \ntemperature range. Despite the JFET inputs, the AD8220- EP \ntypically has a noise corner of only 10 Hz.  \nWith the proliferation of mixed -signal processing, the number \nof power supplies required in each system has grown. The \nAD8220- EP is designed to alleviate this problem.

Input Bias Current and Offset Current vs. Temperature  \n \n \ncan operate on a ±18 V dual supply, as well as on a single 5 V \nsupply. Its rail -to-rail output stage maximizes dynamic range on \nthe low voltage supplies common in portable applications. Its ability to run on a single 5 V supply eliminates the need to use \nhigher voltage, dual supplies. The AD8220 -EP draws a maximum \nof 750  µA of quiescent current  at 25 °C, making it ideal for battery \npowered  devices.  \nGain is set from 1 to 1000 with a single resistor. Increasing the \ngain increases the common -mode rejection. Measurements that \nneed higher CMRR when reading small signals benefit when the AD8220 -EP is set for large gains.  \nA reference pin allows the user to offset the output voltage. This \nfeature is use ful when interfacing with analog -to-digital converters.  \nThe AD8220 -EP is available in an MSOP that takes roughly half \nthe board area of an SOIC. Performance is specified over the \nextended industrial  temperature range of −55 °C to  +125°C .  \nAdditional application and technical information can be found in the AD8220 data sheet.  \n \nAD8220- EP Enhanced Product  \n \nRev.
