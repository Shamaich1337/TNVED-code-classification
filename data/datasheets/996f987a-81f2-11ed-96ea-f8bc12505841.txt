T h e  AD623  offers  user flexibility by \nallowing single gain set resistor programming and by  conforming \nto the 8 -lead industry standard pinout configuration . With no \nexternal resistor,  the AD623  is configured for unity gain (G = 1), \nand with an external resistor, the AD623  can be programmed for \ngains of up to 1000.  \nThe accuracy of the  AD623  is the result of increasing ac \ncommon -mode rejection ratio ( CMRR)  coincident with \nincreasing gain.  Line noise harmonics are rejected due to \nconstant CMRR up to 200 Hz. The AD623  has a wide input \ncommon -mode range and amplifies signals with common -\nmode voltage s as low as 150 mV below ground. The AD623  \nmaintains  optimal  performance with dual and single polarity \npower supplies.  \nTable 1.

G | Page 23 of 32 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe AD623  is an instrumentation amplifier based on a modified \nclassic 3 -op-amp  approach  to ensur e single - or dual -supply \noperation even at common -mode voltages at the negative supply  \nrail. Low voltage offsets (input and output ), absolute gain \naccuracy, and one ex ternal resistor to set the gain  make the \nAD623  a versatile instrumentation am plifier . \nThe input signal is applied to positive -negative -positive ( PNP ) \ntransistors acting as voltage buffers and providing a common -\nmode signal to the input amplifiers (see  Figure 70). An absolute \nvalue 50 k Ω resistor in each amplifier feedback ensures  gain \nprogrammability.  \nThe differential output is  \nC\nGO VRV\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+=kΩ 1001  \nThe differential voltage is then converted to a single -ended \nvoltage using the output amplifier, which also rejects any \ncommon -mode signal  at the output of the input amplifiers.  \nBecause the amplifiers can swing to either supply rail, as well as \nhave their common -mode range extended to below the negative \nsupply rail, the range over which the AD623  can operate is further  \nenhanced (see Figure 30, Figure 31, Figure 32, and Figure 33). \nThe output voltage at Pin 6 (OUTPUT) is measured with \nrespect to the potential at Pin 5  (REF) . The impedance of the REF  pin is 100  kΩ. Therefore, in applications requiring voltage  \nconversion, a small resistor between Pin 5 (REF) and Pin 6  \n(OUTPUT)  is all that is needed.  \n+VS\n+VS–VS7\n4–IN\n+IN2\n37\n–VS450kΩ 50kΩ 50kΩ\n50kΩ 50kΩ 50kΩOUTPUT\nREF6\n5\n81\nRG–RG\n+RG\n00778-041 \nFigu re 70.

G | Page 24 of 32 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION  \nBASIC CONNECTION  \nFigure 71 and Figure 72 show the basic connection circuits for \nthe AD623 . The +V S and −VS terminals are connected to the \npower supply. The supply can be either bipolar (V S = ±2.5 V to \n±6 V) or single supply ( −VS =  0  V,  + VS = 2.7 V to 12  V). \nCapacitively decouple p ower supplies close to the power pins of \nthe device. For optimal results, use surface -mount 0.1 µF ceramic  \nchip capacitors and 10 µ F electrolytic tantalum capacitors.  00778-042RG\nRG VIN OUTPUT VOUT\nREFRG\nREF (INPUT)+2.5V TO +6V+VS\n10µF 0.1µF\n–2.5V TO –6V–VS10µF 0.1µF\n \nFigure 71.

Single -Supply Basic Connection  \nThe input voltage, which can be  either single- ended (tie either \n−IN or +IN to ground) or differential , is amplified by the \nprogrammed gain. The output signal appears as the voltage \ndifference between the OUTPUT pin and the externally applied \nvoltage  on the REF input. For a ground referenced output, \nground REF.  \nGAIN SEL ECTION  \nThe gain of the AD623  is programmed by  the RG resistor , or \nmore precisely, by whatever impedance appears between Pin  1 \nand Pin 8. The AD623  offer s accurate gains using 0.1%  to 1% \ntolerance resistors. Table 7 shows the required values of R G for \nthe various gains. Note that for G = 1, the R G terminals are \nunconnected (R G = ∞). For any arbitrary gain, R G can be \ncalculated by   \nRG = 100 kΩ/(G − 1) Table 7.

The reference terminal  \nprovides a direct means of injecting a precise offset to the \noutput. The reference terminal is also useful when b ipolar \nsignal s are being amplified because the terminal  can provide a \nvirtual ground voltage. The voltage on the reference terminal \ncan vary  from −VS to +V S. \nINPUT AND OUTPUT OFF SET VOLTAGE ERROR  \nThe offset voltage (V OS) of the AD623  is attributed to two \nsources: those originating in the two input stages where the \ninstrumentation amp lifier  gain is established, and those \noriginating in the subtractor  output stage. The output error is \ndivided by the programmed gain when referred to the input. In \npractice, the input errors dominate at high gain settings, \nwhereas the output error prevails when the  gain is set at or near \nunity.  \nCalculate the  VOS error  for any given gain  as follows: \nTotal Error Referred to Input (RTI)   \n= Input Error + (Output Error/ G) \nTotal Error Referred to Output (RTO)   \n= (Input Error × G) + Output Error  \nThe RTI offset errors and n oise voltages for different gains are \nlisted in Table 8. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet AD623 \n \nRev. G | Page 25 of 32 INPUT PROTECTION  \nInternal supply  referenced clamping diodes allow the input, \nreference, output, and gain terminals of the AD623 to safely \nwithstand overvoltages of 0.3 V above or below the supplies. \nThis  overvoltage protection  is true at  all gain settings and when \ncycling  power on and off. Overvoltage protection  is particularly \nimportant because the signal source and amplifier can  be \npowered separately.  \nIf the overvoltage  exceed s this value, limit the current through \nthese diodes  to abo ut 10 mA using external current- limiting \nresistors (see  Figure 73). The size of this res istor is defined by \nthe supply voltage and the required overvoltage protection.  \nRGVOVER\nVOVERAD623\nOUTPUT+VS\n–VSRLIM\nRLIMI = 10mA MAX\nRLIM =VOVER  –VS + 0.7V\n10mA\n00778-043 \nFigure 73.

The circuit in Figure 74 provides RFI \nsuppression without reducing performance within the pas s band of \nthe instrumentation amp lifier . Resistor 1 (R1) and Capacitor 1 \n(C1) , and likewise , Resistor 2 (R2)  and C apacitor 2 (C2) , form a \nlow-pass resistor capacitor ( RC) filter t hat has a −3 dB bandwidth \nequal to f  = 1/(2 π R1C1). Using the component values shown  in \nFigure 74, this filter has a −3 dB bandwidth of approximately 40 \nkHz. The R1 and R2 resistors were chosen  to be large enough to \nisolate the i nput of t he circuit from the  capacitors  but not large enough to significantly increase the noise of the circuit. To \npreserve common -mode rejection in the pass band of the \namplifier , the C1 and C2 capacitors must be ± 5% tolerance , or \nlow cost 20% capacitors  can be tested and binned to provide \nclosely matched devices.   \n00778-044RG–IN\n+INAD623 VOUTR1\n4.02kΩ\n1%\nR2\n4.02kΩ\n1%REFERENCE+VS\n0.01µF 0.33µF\n+VS0.01µF 0.33µFC1\n1000pF\n5%\nC3\n0.047µF\nC2\n1000pF\n5%\nNOTES:\n1.

R1 and R2, as well as C1 and C2 , form a bridge \ncircuit whose output appears across the input pins of the \ninstrumentation amplifier . Any mismatch between C1 and C2 \nunbalances the bridge and reduces the common -mode \nrejection. C3 ensures  that any RF signals are common -mode  \n(the same on both instrumentation a mplifier  inputs) and are \nnot applied differentially. This second low -pass network, R1 + R2 \nand C3, has a − 3 dB  frequency equal to 1/(2π (R1 + R2) (C3)). \nUsing a C3 value of 0.047  µF, t he −3 dB signal bandwidth of this \ncircuit  is approximately 400 Hz. The typical dc offset shift over \nfrequency is less than 1.5 µ V, and the RF signal rejection of the \ncircuit  is greater than  71 dB. The 3 dB  signal bandwidth of this \ncircuit can be increased to 900 Hz by reducing R1 and R2 to \n2.2 kΩ. The performance is similar to using 4 k Ω resistors, \nexcept that the circuitry preceding the instrumentation amp lifier  \nmust drive a lower  impedance load.  \nTable 8.

The R1 and R2 resistors can \nbe common 1% metal film units. H owever, the C1 and C2 \ncapacitors must  be ±5% tolerance devices to avoid degrading \nthe common -mode rejection  of the circuit . Either the traditional \n5% silver mica units or Panasonic ± 2% polyphenylene sulfide ( PPS) \nfilm capacitors are recommended.  \nIn many applications, shielded cables minimize noise . For \noptimal  CMR over frequency, the shield must  be properly driven. \nFigure 75 shows an active guard driver that is configured to \nimprove ac common -mode rejection by bootstrapping the \ncapacitances of input cable shields, thus minimizing the \ncapacitance mismatch between the input s. \nAD623 OUTPUT\nREF+VS\n–VS2\n1\n8\n36\n57\n4RG\n2RG\n2\nAD8031100Ω\n00778-045–IN\n+IN\n \nFigure 75. Common -Mode Shield Driver  \nGROUNDING  \nBecause the AD623 output voltage is developed with respect \nto the potential on the reference terminal, many grounding problems can be solved by simply tying the REF pin to the \nappropriate local ground. Tie t he REF pin to a low impedance \npoint for optimal CMR.  \nThe use of ground planes is recommended to minimize the \nimpedance of ground returns (and therefore  the size of dc \nerrors). To isolate low level analog signals from a noisy digital \nenvironment, many data acquisition components have separate \nanalog and digital ground returns (see  Figure 76). All ground \npins from mixed signal components, such as analog -to-digital \nconverters (ADCs), must  be returned through the high quality \nanalog ground plane. Maximum isolation between analog and \ndigital is achieved by connecting the ground p lanes back at the \nsupplies. The digital return currents from the ADC that flow in \nthe analog ground plane, in general, have a negligible effect on \nnoise performance.  \nIf there is only a single power supply available, it must be shared \nby both digital and analog circuitry. Figure 77 shows how to \nminimize interference between the digital and analog circuitry. \nAs in the previous case, use separate analog and digital ground \nplanes (reasonably thick traces can be used as an alternative to a \ndigital ground plane). Connect t hese ground planes at the g round \npin of the power supply. Run s eparate traces from the power \nsupply to the supply pins of the digital and analog circuits. Ideally, \neach device has its own power supply tra ce, but these can be \nshared by a number of devices, as long as a single trace is not used \nto route current to both digital and analog circuitry.  \n \nAGND VDD\nMICROPROCESSORAD6232\n36\n57\n4ANALOG POWER SUPPLY\nGND –5V +5VDIGITAL POWER SUPPLY\n+5V GND\n4VIN11\nVDD6\nAGND14\nDGND\n3VIN2ADC\nAD7892-20.1µF 0.1µF 0.1µF 0.1µF\n12\n00778-046 \nFigure 76.

G | Page 27 of 32 Ground Returns for Input Bias Currents  \nInput bias currents are  dc currents that must flow to bias the \ninput tr ansistors of an amp lifier , which are usually transistor \nbase currents. When amplifying floating input sources, such as \ntransformers or ac -coupled sources, there must be a direct dc \npath into each input so that the bias current can flow. Figure 78, \nFigure 79, and Figure 80 show how a bias current path can be \nprovided for transformer coupling, thermocouple, and \ncapacitive ac coupling. In dc- coupled resis tive bridge \napplications, providing this path is generally not  necessary \nbecause  the bias current simply flows from the bridge supply \nthrough the bridge into the amplifier. However, if the impedances  \nthat the two inputs see are large and differ by a large amount \n(>10 k Ω), the offset current of the input stage causes dc errors \nproportional with the input offset voltage of the  amplifier.  \nAD623 OUTPUT\nTO POWER\nSUPPLY\nGROUNDREF\nLOAD+VS\n–VS2\n1\n8\n36\n57\n4RG–IN\n+IN\n00778-048 \nFigure 78.

Simplified Block Diagram  \nThe voltages on these internal nodes are critical in determining  \nwhether the output voltage is  clipped. The V A1 and V A2 voltage s \ncan swing from approximately 10 mV above the negative  supply \n(−VS or ground) to within approximately 100  mV of the positive \nrail before clipping occurs. Based on this , and from the previous \nequations, the maximum and minimum input common -mode \nvoltages ar e given by the following equations:  \nVCMMA X = +VS − 0.7 V −  VDIFF × Gain /2 \nVCMMIN  = −VS − 0.590 V +  VDIFF × Gain /2 \nThese equations can be rearranged to give the maximum possible  \ndifferential voltage (positive or negative) for a particular common -\nmode voltag e, gain, and power supply. Because the signals on \nA1 and A2 can clip on either rail, the maximum differential \nvoltage is the lesser of the two equations.  |VDIFFMAX | = 2 ( +VS − 0.7 V −  VCM)/Gain  \n|VDIFFMAX | = 2 ( VCM − −VS + 0.590 V) /Gain  \nHowever, the range o n the differential input voltage range is \nalso constrained by the output swing. Therefore, the range of \nVDIFF may need  to be lower a ccording  to the following equation:  \nInput Range  ≤ Available Output Swing/Gain  \nFor a bipolar input voltage with a common -mode  voltage that is \nroughly half way between the rails, V DIFFMAX  is half the value that \nthe previous equations yield because the REF pin is at midsupply.  \nNote that the available output swing is given for different supply \nconditions in the Specifications  section.  \nThe equations can be rearranged to result in the maximum gain \nfor a fixed set of input conditions. T he maximum gain is  the \nlesser of the two equations.  \nGain MAX = 2 ( +VS − 0.7 V −  VCM)/VDIFF \nGain MAX = 2 ( VCM − −VS + 0.590 V)/VDIFF \nAgain, it is recommend ed that the resulting gain multiplied by  \nthe input range is less than the available output swing. If this is \nnot the case,  the maximum gain is given by  \nGain MAX = Available O utput Swing/Input Range  \nAlso , for bipolar inputs (that is, input range = 2 V DIFF), the \nmaximum gain is half the value yielded by the previous equations  \nbecause the REF pin must be at midsupply.  \nThe maximum gain and resulting output swing for different inpu t \ncondition s is shown  in Table 10. Output voltages are referenced \nto the voltage on the REF pin.  \nFor the purposes of computation, it is necessary to break down the  \ninput voltage into its differential and common -mode component s. \nTherefore, when one of the inputs is grounded or at a fixed \nvoltage, the common -mode voltage changes as the differential \nvoltage changes. An example of this is  the thermocouple \namplifier in  Figure 82. The inverting input on the AD623  is \ngrounded . Therefore, when the input voltage is − 10 mV , the \nvoltage on the noninverting input is − 10 mV . For the purpose of \nthe signal swing calculations, this input voltage must  be \ncomposed of a common -mode voltage of − 5 mV (that is, (+IN \n+ −IN)/2) and a  differential input voltage of − 10 mV (that is, \n+IN − −IN). \n \nData Sheet AD623 \n \nRev.
