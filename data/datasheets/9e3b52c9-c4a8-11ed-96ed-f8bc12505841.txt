These precautions include, but are not limited to: using a low pressure wash and providing a follow up bake cycle sufficient to remove any moisture trapped within the device due to the washing process. Due to the variability of the wash parameters used to clean the board, determination of the bake temperature and duration necessary to remove the moisture trapped within the package is the responsibility of the user (assembler). Cleaning or drying methods that employ ultrasonic energy may damage the device and should not be used.
