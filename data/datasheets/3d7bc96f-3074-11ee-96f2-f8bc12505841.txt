C | Page 10 of 13 THEORY OF O PERATION  \nIn typical applications, the AD8211 amplifies a small differential  \ninput voltage generated by the load current flowing through a \nshunt resistor. The AD8211 rejects high common -mode voltages \n(up to 65 V) and provides a ground referenced , buffered output \nthat interfaces with an analog -to-digital converter  (ADC) . \nFigure 23 shows a simplified schematic of the AD8211. 06824-022V+\nVOUT = (I SHUNT  × R SHUNT ) × 20\nG = +20\nAD8211A1\nPROPRIETARY\nOFFSET\nCIRCUITRY\nGNDR1\nROUTQ1RISHUNT\nIINRSHUNT\n \nFigure 23. Simplified Schematic  A load current flowing through the external shunt resistor produces a voltage at the input terminals of the AD8211. The inpu t terminals connect to Amplifier A1 by Resistor  R and \nResistor R1. The inverting terminal, which has ver y high input \nimpedance , is held  to the following  because negligible current \nflows thro ugh Resistor R : \n(V\nCM) − (ISHUNT  × RSHUNT )  \nAmplifier A1 forces the non inverting input to the same potential. \nTheref ore, the current that flows through Resistor R1 is equal to  \nIIN = (I SHUNT  × RSHUNT )/R1  \nThis current (I IN) is converted back to a voltage vi a R OUT. The \noutput buffer amplifier has a gain of 20  V/V and offers excellent \naccuracy because  the internal gain setting resistors are precision \ntrimmed to within  0.01% matching.

C | Page 11 of 13 APPLICATION NOTES\nOUTPUT LINEARITY  \nIn all current sensing applications, and especially in automotive \nand industrial environments where the common -mode voltage \ncan vary significantly, it is important that the current sensor \nmaintain the specified output linearity , regardless of the input \ndifferential or common -mode voltage. The AD8211 contains \nspecific circuitry on the input stage, which ensures that even \nwhen the differential input voltage is very s mall, and the \ncommon -mode voltage is also low (below the 5  V supply), \nthe input -to-output linearity is maintained. Figure 24 shows  \nthe input differential voltage vs . the corresponding output \nvoltage at different co mmon modes.  \n200\n0\n0\n06824-115\nDIFFERENTIAL INPUT VOLTAGE (mV)OUTPUT VOLTAGE (mV)\n10180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9IDEAL V OUT (mV)\nVOUT (mV) @ V CM = 0V\nVOUT (mV) @ V CM = 65V\n \nFigure 24. Gain Linearity Due to Differential and Common -Mode Voltage  Regardless of the common mode  voltage , the AD8211 provides \na correct output voltage  when the input differential is at least \n2 mV, which is due to the voltage range of the output amplifier \nthat can go as low as 33  mV typical. The specified minim um \noutput amplifier voltage is 10 0 mV to  provide sufficient guard  \nbands.  The ability of the AD8211 to work with very small \ndifferential inputs , regardless of the common -mode voltage, \nallows for additional  dynamic range, accuracy, and flexibility in \nany current  sensing application.  \n \n \nAD8211 Data Sheet\n \nRev. C | Page 12 of 13 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nHIGH-SIDE CURRENT SENSE WITH A LOW-SIDE \nSWITCH \nIn such load control configurations, the PWM-controlled \nswitch is ground referenced. An inductive load (solenoid) is tied \nto a power supply. A resistive shunt is placed between the switch \nand the load (see Figure 25). An advantage of placing the shunt on \nthe high side is that the entire current, including the recirculation current, can be measured because the shunt remains in the loop when the switch is off. In addition, diagnostics can be enhanced because shorts to ground can be detected with the shunt on the \nhigh side. In this circuit configuration, when the switch is \nclosed, the common-mode voltage moves down to near the negative rail. When the switch is opened, the voltage reversal across the inductive load causes the common-mode voltage to \nbe held one diode drop above the battery by the clamp diode. \n5V\n06824-024INDUCTIVE\nLOAD\nCLAMP\nDIODE\nSHUNT\nSWITCHBATTERYGND2\nVIN+\nVIN–1\n5OUT\nV+3\n4AD82111 2 3\n5 4\n \nFigure 25. Low-Side Switch \nHIGH-SIDE CURRENT SENSING \nIn this configuration, the shunt resistor is referenced to the \nbattery. High voltage is present at the inputs of the current sense \namplifier. In this mode, the recirculation current is again measured and shorts to ground can be detected. When the shunt is battery referenced, the AD8211 produces a linear ground referenced, \nanalog output. An AD8214 can also provide an overcurrent \ndetection signal in as little as 100 ns. This feature is useful in high current systems where fast shutdown in overcurrent \nconditions is essential. \n06824-0255VINDUCTIVE\nLOADCLAMP\nDIODESHUNT\nSWITCHBATTERY1 2 3 48 7 6 5\nAD8214GND NC –IN OUT\nVREG +IN V S NCOVERCURRENT\nDETECTION (<100ns)\nGND2\nVIN+\nVIN–1\n5OUT\nV+3\n4AD82111 2 3\n5 4\n \nFigure 26.

The **AD8211** is a high voltage, precision current shunt amplifier designed for accurate current sensing in various applications. It features a fixed gain of 20 V/V and is capable of measuring small differential voltages across a shunt resistor while rejecting high common-mode voltages. The device is particularly noted for its buffered output, which allows for direct interfacing with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

#### Typical Applications:
The AD8211 is widely used in:
- **High-side current sensing**: Measuring current in automotive and industrial applications where the load is connected to a high voltage.
- **Motor controls**: Monitoring and controlling motor currents for efficiency and safety.
- **Transmission controls**: Ensuring proper functioning of transmission systems in vehicles.
- **Engine management**: Monitoring engine parameters for optimal performance.
- **Suspension controls**: Managing active suspension systems in vehicles.
- **Vehicle dynamic controls**: Enhancing vehicle stability and handling.
- **DC-to-DC converters**: Providing feedback for current regulation in power supply circuits.

This component is particularly suitable for automotive applications due to its robust design and high reliability, making it ideal for use in environments with varying temperatures and electrical noise.
