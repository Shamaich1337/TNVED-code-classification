Both commercial and industrial\ntemperature applicatio ns are supported.\nThe frequency of the reference clock is user selectable. The USB3320 includes an internal oscillator\nthat may be used with either a quar tz crystal or a ceramic resonator. Alternatively, the crystal input can\nbe driven by an external clock oscillator. Another option is the use of a 60MHz external clock when\nusing the ULPI Input Clock mode.\nSeveral advanced features make the USB3320 the transceiver of choice by reducing both electrical\nbill of material (eBOM) part count and printed circuit board (PCB) area. Outstanding ESD robustness\neliminates the need for external ESD protection devi ces in typical applications. The internal Over-\nVoltage Protection circuit (OVP) protects the USB3320  from voltages up to 30V. By using a reference\nclock from the Link, the USB3320 removes the cost  of a dedicated crystal reference from the design.\nAnd the integrated USB switch enabl es unique product features with a single USB port of connection.\nThe USB3320 meets all of the electrical requirements to be used as a Hi-Speed USB Host, Device,\nor an On-the-Go (OTG) transceiver. In addition  to the supporting USB signaling, the USB3320 also\nprovides USB UART mode and USB Audio mode.\nUSB3320 uses the industry standard UTMI+ Low Pin In terface (ULPI) to connect the USB Transceiver\nto the Link. ULPI uses a method of in-band signa ling and status byte transfers between the Link and\ntransceiver to facilitate a USB session with only 12 pins.\nThe USB3320 uses SMSC’s “wrapper-less” technology to  implement the ULPI interface. This “wrapper-\nless” technology allows the transceiver to achiev e a low latency transmit and receive time. SMSC’s\nlow latency transceiver allows an existing UTMI Li nk to be reused by adding a UTMI to ULPI bridge.\nBy adding a bridge to the ASIC the existing and proven UTMI Link IP can be reused.\nFigure 1 USB3320 Block DiagramOTG\nHi-Speed \nUSB \nTransceiver\nULPI InterfaceULPI \nRegisters \nand State \nMachineBIASCrystal \nOscillator and \nLow Jitter\nIntegrated \nPLL\nIntegrated \nPower \nManagementVBUS\nID\nDP\nDMRBIASREFCLKESD Protection\nDATA[7:0]CPENXO\nRESETB\nVDD18VDD33VBAT\nDIRNXTSTP\nCLKOUTUSB\nDP/DM\nSwitch\nSPK_L\nSPK_RVDDIOREFSEL[2:0]\nHighly Integrated Full Featured Hi-Speed USB 2.0 ULPI Transceiver\nRevision 1.0 (07-14-09) 4 SMSC USB3320\nPRODUCT PREVIEW \nThe USB3320 includes an integrated 3.3V Low Drop  Out (LDO) regulator that  may optionally be used\nto generate 3.3V from power applied at the VBAT  pin. The voltage on the VBAT  pin can range from\n3.1 to 5.5V. The regulator dropout voltage is less than 100mV which allows the transceiver to continue\nUSB signaling when the voltage on VBAT  drops to 3.1V. The USB transce iver will continue to operate\nat lower voltages, although some parameters may be  outside the limits of the USB specifications. If\nthe user would like to provide a 3.3V supply to the USB3320, the VBAT  and VDD33  pins should be\nconnected together.\nThe USB3320 also includes integrated pull-up resi stors that can be used fo r detecting the attachment\nof a USB Charger. By sensing the attachment to  a USB Charger, a product using the USB3320 can\ncharge its battery at more than the 500mA allowe d when charging from a USB Host. Please see SMSC\nApplication Note AN 19.7 - Battery Charging Usin g SMSC USB Transceivers for more information on\nbattery charging.\nIn USB UART mode, the USB3320 DP and DM pins are redefined to enable pass-through of\nasynchronous serial data. The USB3320 can only enter UART mode when the user programs the partinto this mode.\nIn USB audio mode, a switch connects the DP pin to the SPK_R  pin, and another switch connects he\nDM pin to the SPK_L  pin. The USB3320 can be configured to enter USB audio mode. In addition,\nthese switches are on when the RESETB  pin of the USB3320 is asserted. The USB audio mode\nenables audio signalling from a single USB port of connection, and the switches may also be used to\nconnect Full Speed USB from anoth er transceiver onto the USB cable.\nHighly Integrated Full Featured Hi-Speed USB 2.0 ULPI Transceiver\nSMSC USB3320 5 Revision 1.0 (07-14-09)\nPRODUCT PREVIEW \nPackage Outline\nNotes:\n1.
