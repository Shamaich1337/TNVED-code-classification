Advanced high speed circuitry allows the device to regulate from an input voltage of 20 V, while \nproviding an output voltage of 3.3 V at a switching frequency of 2.1 MHz.  The innovative architecture allows \nthe device to regulate a 3.3-V output from an input of only 3.8 V. The regulator automatically switches modes \nbetween PFM and PWM depending on load. At heavy loads, the device operates in PWM at a constant \nswitching frequency. At light loads, the mode changes to PFM with diode emulation allowing DCM. This reduces \nthe input supply current and keeps efficiency high. The device features internal loop compensation which \nreduces design time and requires fewer external components than externally compensated regulators.\nThe LMR33630-Q1  is available in an ultra-miniature VQFN package with wettable flanks. This package features \nextremely small parasitic inductance and resistance, enabling very high efficiency while minimizing switch node \nringing and dramatically reducing EMI. The VIN/PGND pin layout is symmetrical on either side of the VQFN \npackage. This allows the input current magnetic fields to partially cancel, resulting in reduce EMI generation.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n+\n- +\n-CONTROL\nLOGICDRIVERHS CURRENT\nSENSE\nLS CURRENT\nSENSEOSCILLATOR\nPWM\nCOMP.ERROR \nAMPLIFIER\nPOWER GOOD\nCONTROLSWVIN\nPGNDFBENINT.

This open-drain output goes low under fault \nconditions, such as current limit and thermal shutdown, as well as during normal start-up. A glitch filter prevents \nfalse flag operation for short excursions of the output voltage, such as during line and load transients. The timing \nparameters of the glitch filter are found in Section 6.5. Output voltage excursions lasting less than t PG do not trip \nthe power-good flag. Power-good operation can best be understood by reference to Figure 7-1  and Figure 7-2 . \nNote that during initial power up, a delay of about 4 ms (typical) is inserted from the time that EN is asserted \nto the time that the power-good flag goes high. This delay only occurs during start-up and is not encountered \nduring normal operation of the power-good function.\nThe power-good output consists of an open-drain NMOS, requiring an external pullup resistor to a suitable logic \nsupply. It can also be pulled up to either VCC or V OUT, through a 100-k Ω resistor, as desired. If this function \nis not needed, the PG pin must be left floating. When EN is pulled low, the flag output is also forced low. With \nEN low, power good remains valid as long as the input voltage is ≥ 2 V (typical). Limit the current into the \npower-good flag pin to less than 5 mA D.C. The maximum current is internally limited to about 35 mA when the \ndevice is enabled and about 65 mA when the device is disabled. The internal current limit protects the device \nfrom any transient currents that can occur when discharging a filter capacitor connected to this output.\nHigh = Power GoodVOUT\nPG\nLow = Fault(95%)\n (93%)(107%)\n (105%)VPG-HIGH_UP\nVPG-HIGH-DN\nVPG-LOW-UP\nVPG-LOW-DN\nFigure 7-1.

Power-Good-Timing Behavior\n7.3.2 Enable and Start-up\nStart-up and shutdown are controlled by the EN input. This input features precision thresholds, allowing the use \nof an external voltage divider to provide an adjustable input UVLO (see Section 8.2.2.10 ). Applying a voltage of \n≥ VEN-VCC_H  causes the device to enter standby mode, powering the internal VCC, but not producing an output \nvoltage. Increasing the EN voltage to V EN-H fully enables the device, allowing it to enter start-up mode and start \nthe soft-start period. When the EN input is brought below V EN-H by V EN-HYS , the regulator stops running and \nenters standby mode. Further decrease in the EN voltage to below V EN-VCC-L  completely shuts down the device. \nThis behavior is shown in Figure 7-3 . The EN input can be connected directly to VIN if this feature is not needed. \nThis input must not be allowed to float. The values for the various EN thresholds can be found in Section 6.5.\nThe LMR33630-Q1  uses a reference-based soft start that prevents output voltage overshoots and large inrush \ncurrents as the regulator is starting up. A typical start-up waveform is shown in Figure 7-4 , indicating typical \ntimings. The rise time of the output voltage is about 4 ms (see the Section 6.5).www.ti.comLMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\nEN\nVCC\n0VEN-H\nVEN-H ± VEN-HYS\nVEN-VCC-L\n5V\nVOUTVOUT\n0VEN-VCC-HFigure 7-3.

Typical Start-up Behavior V IN = 12 V, V OUT = 5 V, I OUT = 3 A\n7.3.3 Current Limit and Short Circuit\nThe LMR33630-Q1  incorporates both peak and valley inductor current limit to provide protection to the device \nfrom overloads and short circuits and limit the maximum output current. Valley current limit prevents inductor \ncurrent runaway during short circuits on the output, while both peak and valley limits work together to limit the \nmaximum output current of the converter. Cycle-by-cycle current limit is used for overloads, while hiccup mode \nis used for sustained short circuits. Finally, a zero current detector is used on the low-side power MOSFET to \nimplement DEM at light loads (see the Glossary ). The typical value of this current limit is found under I ZC in \nSection 6.5.\nWhen the device is overloaded, the valley of the inductor current may not reach below I LIMIT (see Section \n6.5) before the next clock cycle. When this occurs, the valley current limit control skips that cycle, causing \nthe switching frequency to drop. Further overload causes the switching frequency to continue to drop, and the \ninductor ripple current to increase. When the peak of the inductor current reaches the high-side current limit, I SC LMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\n(see Section 6.5), the switch duty cycle is reduced and the output voltage falls out of regulation. This represents \nthe maximum output current from the converter and is given approximately by Equation 1 .\nLIMIT SC\nOUT maxI I I2\x0e \n(1)\nIf, during current limit, the voltage on the FB input falls below about 0.4 V due to a short circuit, the device enters \ninto hiccup mode. In this mode, the device stops switching for t HC (see Section 6.7), or about 94 ms and then \ngoes through a normal re-start with soft start. If the short-circuit condition remains, the device runs in current limit \nfor about 20 ms (typical) and then shuts down again. This cycle repeats, as shown in Figure 7-5  as long as the \nshort-circuit-condition persists. This mode of operation helps reduce the temperature rise of the device during \na hard short on the output. The output current is greatly reduced during hiccup mode. Once the output short is \nremoved and the hiccup delay is passed, the output voltage recovers normally as shown in Figure 7-6 .\nInductor\nCurent\n1A/\n50ms/div\nFigure 7-5.

Short-Circuit Transient and Recovery\n7.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout and Thermal Shutdown\nThe LMR33630-Q1  incorporates an undervoltage-lockout feature on the output of the internal LDO (at the VCC \npin). When VCC reaches about 3.7 V, the device is ready to receive an EN signal and start up. When VCC falls \nbelow about 3 V, the device shuts down, regardless of EN status. Because the LDO is in dropout during these \ntransitions, the above values roughly represent the input voltage levels during the transitions.\nThermal shutdown is provided to protect the regulator from excessive junction temperature. When the junction \ntemperature reaches about 165°C, the device shuts down; re-start occurs when the temperature falls to about \n148°C.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Auto Mode\nIn auto mode, the device moves between PWM and PFM as the load changes. At light loads, the regulator \noperates in PFM. At higher loads, the mode changes to PWM. The load current for which the device moves from \nPFM to PWM can be found in Section 8.2.3 . The output current at which the device changes modes depends \non the input voltage, inductor value, and the nominal switching frequency. For output currents above the curve, \nthe device is in PWM mode. For currents below the curve, the device is in PFM. The curves apply for a nominal \nswitching frequency of 400 kHz and the BOM shown in Table 8-3 . At higher switching frequencies, the load at \nwhich the mode change occurs is greater. For applications where the switching frequency must be known for a \ngiven condition, the transition between PFM and PWM must be carefully tested before the design is finalized.\nIn PWM mode, the regulator operates as a constant frequency converter using PWM to regulate the output \nvoltage. While operating in this mode, the output voltage is regulated by switching at a constant frequency and www.ti.comLMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\nmodulating the duty cycle to control the power to the load. This provides excellent line and load regulation and \nlow output voltage ripple.\nIn PFM, the high-side MOSFET is turned on in a burst of one or more pulses to provide energy to the load. \nThe duration of the burst depends on how long it takes the inductor current to reach I PEAK-MIN . The periodicity \nof these bursts is adjusted to regulate the output, while diode emulation (DEM) is used to maximize efficiency \n(see the Glossary ). This mode provides high light-load efficiency by reducing the amount of input supply current \nrequired to regulate the output voltage at light loads. PFM results in very good light-load efficiency, but also \nyields larger output voltage ripple and variable switching frequency. Also, a small increase in output voltage \noccurs at light loads. The actual switching frequency and output voltage ripple depends on the input voltage, \noutput voltage, and load. Typical switching waveforms in PFM and PWM are shown in Figure 7-7  and Figure 7-8 .\nSee Section 8.2.3  for output voltage variation with load in auto mode.\nSW, \n5V/Div\nVOUT, \n10mV/Div\nInductor\nCurrent,\n0.5A/Div\n50µs/Div\nFigure 7-7.

Typical PWM Switching Waveforms V IN \n= 12 V, V OUT = 5 V, I OUT = 3 A, ƒ S = 400 kHz\n7.4.2 Dropout\nThe dropout performance of any buck regulator is affected by the R DSON  of the power MOSFETs, the DC \nresistance of the inductor, and the maximum duty cycle that the controller can achieve. As the input voltage level \napproaches the output voltage, the off-time of the high-side MOSFET starts to approach the minimum value (see \nSection 6.6). Beyond this point, the switching can become erratic, and the output voltage falls out of regulation. \nTo avoid this problem, the LMR33630-Q1  automatically reduces the switching frequency to increase the effective \nduty cycle and maintain regulation. In this data sheet, the dropout voltage is defined as the difference between \nthe input and output voltage when the output has dropped by 1% of its nominal value. Under this condition, \nthe switching frequency has dropped to its minimum value of about 140 kHz. Note that the 0.4 V short circuit \ndetection threshold is not activated when in dropout mode. Typical dropout characteristics can be found in  Figure \n7-9, Figure 7-10 , Figure 7-11 , and Figure 7-12 .LMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\n33.544.555.56\n4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7Output Voltage (V) \nInput Voltage (V) 1A\n2A\n3A\n0A\nC017 Figure 7-9.

Typical Switching Frequency in \nDropout Mode V OUT = 5 V, f SW = 2.1 MHz\n7.4.3 Minimum Switch On-Time\nEvery switching regulator has a minimum controllable on-time dictated by the inherent delays and blanking \ntimes associated with the control circuits. This imposes a minimum switch duty cycle and, therefore, a minimum \nconversion ratio. The constraint is encountered at high input voltages and low output voltages. To help extend \nthe minimum controllable duty cycle, the LMR33630-Q1  automatically reduces the switching frequency when the \nminimum on-time limit is reached. This way the converter can regulate the lowest programmable output voltage \nat the maximum input voltage. An estimate for the approximate input voltage, for a given output voltage, before \nfrequency foldback occurs is found in Equation 2 . The values of t ON and f SW can be found in Section 6.5. As \nthe input voltage is increased, the switch on-time (duty-cycle) reduces to regulate the output voltage. When the \non-time reaches the limit, the switching frequency drops, while the on-time remains fixed. This relationship is \nhighlighted in Figure 7-13  for a nominal switching frequency of 2.1 MHz.\nSW ONOUT\nINf tVV\x98d\n(2)www.ti.comLMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\n11.21.41.61.822.22.42.6\n10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38Switching Frequency (MHz) \nInput Voltage (V) 1A\n2A\n3A\nC024 Figure 7-13.

TI’s customers are responsible for determining \nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe LMR33630-Q1  step-down DC-to-DC converter is typically used to convert a higher DC voltage to a \nlower DC voltage with a maximum output current of 3 A. The following design procedure can be used to \nselect components for the LMR33630-Q1 . Alternately, the WEBENCH Design Tool can be used to generate a \ncomplete design. This tool utilizes an iterative design procedure and has access to a comprehensive database of \ncomponents. This allows the tool to create an optimized design and allows the user to experiment with various \noptions.\nNote\nIn this data sheet, the effective  value of capacitance is defined as the actual capacitance under \nD.C. bias and temperature; not the rated or nameplate values. Use high-quality, low-ESR, ceramic \ncapacitors with an X5R or better dielectric throughout. All high value ceramic capacitors have a \nlarge voltage coefficient in addition to normal tolerances and temperature effects. Under D.C. bias \nthe capacitance drops considerably. Large case sizes and/or higher voltage ratings are better in this \nregard. To help mitigate these effects, multiple capacitors can be used in parallel to bring the minimum \neffective  capacitance up to the required value. This can also ease the RMS current requirements on \na single capacitor. A careful study of bias and temperature variation of any capacitor bank should be \nmade in order to ensure that the minimum value of effective  capacitance is provided.\n8.2 Typical Application\nFigure 8-1  shows a typical application circuit for the LMR33630-Q1 . This device is designed to function over a \nwide range of external components and system parameters. However, the internal compensation is optimized for \na certain range of external inductance and output capacitance. As a quick start guide, Figure 8-1  provide typical \ncomponent values for a range of the most common output voltages. The values given in the table are typical. \nOther values can be used to enhance certain performance criterion as required by the application. Note that for \nthe VQFN package, the input capacitors are split and placed on either side of the package; see Section 8.2.2.6 \nfor more details.www.ti.comLMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\nVIN\nEN\nVCC\nAGND PGNDSW\nBOOT\nFBVINVOUTL\nCBOOT\nCOUTCIN\nCVCC10 µF\n4x 22 µF8 µH\n0.1 µF\n1 µFCFFRFBT\nRFBB100 N\x9f\n24.9 N\x9f6 V to 36 V 5 V \nPG\nPGCHF\n100 N\x9f220 nF3 AFigure 8-1.

For this example, 400 kHz was chosen.\n8.2.2.3 Setting the Output Voltage\nThe output voltage of the LMR33630-Q1  is externally adjustable using a resistor divider network. The range of \nrecommended output voltage is found in Section 6.3. The divider network is comprised of R FBT and R FBB, and \ncloses the loop between the output voltage and the converter. The converter regulates the output voltage by \nholding the voltage on the FB pin equal to the internal reference voltage, V REF. The resistance of the divider \nis a compromise between excessive noise pick-up and excessive loading of the output. Smaller values of \nresistance reduce noise sensitivity but also reduce the light-load efficiency. The recommended value for R FBT is \n100 k Ω; with a maximum value of 1 M Ω. If a 1 M Ω is selected for R FBT, then a feedforward capacitor must be \nused across this resistor to provide adequate loop phase margin (see Section 8.2.2.9 ). Once R FBT is selected, \nEquation 3  is used to select R FBB. VREF is nominally 1 V (see Section 6.5 for limits).\n»¼º\n«¬ª\x10 \n1VVRR\nREFOUTFBT\nFBB\n(3)\nFor this 5-V example, R FBT = 100 kΩ and R FBB = 24.9 kΩ are chosen.\n8.2.2.4 Inductor Selection\nThe parameters for selecting the inductor are the inductance and saturation current. The inductance is based \non the desired peak-to-peak ripple current and is normally chosen to be in the range of 20% to 40% of \nthe maximum output current. Experience shows that the best value for inductor ripple current is 30% of the \nmaximum load current. Note that when selecting the ripple current for applications with much smaller maximum \nload than the maximum available from the device, the maximum device current should be used. Equation 4  can \nbe used to determine the value of inductance. The constant K is the percentage of inductor current ripple. For \nthis example, K = 0.3 was chosen and an inductance L = 8.1 µH  was found; the next standard value of 8 µH  was \nselected.\n\x0b \x0c\nINOUT\nmax OUT SWOUT IN\nVV\nI K fV VL \x98\x98 \x98\x10 \n(4)\nIdeally, the saturation current rating of the inductor must be at least as large as the high-side switch current \nlimit, I SC (see Section 6.5). This ensures that the inductor does not saturate even during a short circuit on \nthe output. When the inductor core material saturates, the inductance falls to a very low value, causing the \ninductor current to rise very rapidly. Although the valley current limit, I LIMIT, is designed to reduce the risk of \ncurrent run-away, a saturated inductor can cause the current to rise to high values very rapidly. This can lead \nto component damage; do not allow the inductor to saturate. Inductors with a ferrite core material have very \nhard saturation characteristics, but usually have lower core losses than powdered iron cores. Powered iron cores \nexhibit a soft saturation, allowing for some relaxation in the current rating of the inductor. However, they have www.ti.comLMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\nmore core losses at frequencies typically above 1 MHz. In any case, the inductor saturation current must not \nbe less than the device low-side current limit, I LIMIT (see the Section 6.5). The maximum inductance is limited \nby the minimum current ripple required for the current mode control to perform correctly. As a rule-of-thumb, the \nminimum inductor ripple current must be no less than about 10% of the device maximum rated current under \nnominal conditions.\nSWOUT\nMINfV28 . 0 L \x98t\n(5)\n8.2.2.5 Output Capacitor Selection\nThe value of the output capacitor and the ESR of the capacitor determine the output voltage ripple and load \ntransient performance. The output capacitor bank is usually limited by the load transient requirements, rather \nthan the output voltage ripple. Equation 6  can be used to estimate a lower bound on the total output capacitance \nand an upper bound on the ESR, which is required to meet a specified load transient.\n\x0b \x0c \x0b \x0c \x0b \x0c\n\x0b \x0c\nINOUT2\nOUTOUT2\nOUT SWOUT\nOUT\nVVD) D1 (1112KK1 I2V K2ESRD212KK1D1K V fIC\n »»\n¼º\n««\n¬ª\n¸¸\n¹·\n¨¨\n©§\n\x10\x0e\x98\x0e\x0e\' \x98\' \x98\x0ed»»\n¼º\n««\n¬ª\n\x10\x98\x0e\x0e\x98\x10\x98\x98\' \x98\'t\n(6)\nwhere\n•ΔVOUT = output voltage transient\n•ΔIOUT = output current transient\n•K = ripple factor from Section 8.2.2.4\nOnce the output capacitor and ESR have been calculated, Equation 7  can be used to check the peak-to-peak \noutput voltage ripple; V r.\n\x0b \x0c2\nOUT SW2\nL rC f 81ESRI V\n\x98\x98\x0e\x98\' #\n(7)\nThe output capacitor and ESR can then be adjusted to meet both the load transient and output ripple \nrequirements.\nFor this example, a ΔVOUT ≤ 250 mV for an output current step of ΔIOUT = 2 A is required. Equation 6  gives a \nminimum value of 52 µF and a maximum ESR of 0.11 Ω. Assuming a 20% tolerance and a 10% bias de-rating, \nyou arrive at a minimum capacitance of 72 µF. This can be achieved with a bank of 4 × 22-µF, 16-V ceramic \ncapacitors in the 1210 case size. More output capacitance can be used to improve the load transient response. \nCeramic capacitors can easily meet the minimum ESR requirements. In some cases, an aluminum electrolytic \ncapacitor can be placed in parallel with the ceramics to help build up the required value of capacitance. In \ngeneral, use a capacitor of at least 10 V for output voltages of 3.3 V or less and a capacitor of 16 V or more for \noutput voltages of 5 V and above.\nIn practice, the output capacitor has the most influence on the transient response and loop phase margin. Load \ntransient testing and Bode plots are the best way to validate any given design and must always be completed \nbefore the application goes into production. In addition to the required output capacitance, a small ceramic \nplaced on the output can help reduce high frequency noise. Small case size ceramic capacitors in the range LMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\nof 1 nF to 100 nF can be very helpful in reducing voltage spikes on the output caused by inductor and board \nparasitics.\nThe maximum value of total output capacitance must be limited to about 10 times the design value, or 1000 \nµF, whichever is smaller. Large values of output capacitance can adversely affect the start-up behavior of the \nregulator as well as the loop stability. If values larger than noted here must be used, then a careful study of \nstart-up at full load and loop stability must be performed.\n8.2.2.6 Input Capacitor Selection\nThe ceramic input capacitors provide a low impedance source to the regulator in addition to supplying the \nripple current and isolating switching noise from other circuits. A minimum of 10 µF of ceramic capacitance is \nrequired on the input of the LMR33630-Q1 . This must be rated for at least the maximum input voltage that the \napplication requires; preferably twice the maximum input voltage. This capacitance can be increased to help \nreduce input voltage ripple and maintain the input voltage during load transients. In addition, a small case size, \n220-nF ceramic capacitor must be used at the input, as close as possible to the regulator. This provides a high \nfrequency bypass for the control circuits internal to the device. For this example, a 4.7-µF, 50-V, X7R (or better) \nceramic capacitor is chosen. The 220 nF must also be rated at 50 V with an X7R dielectric. The VQFN (RNX) \npackage provides two input voltage pins and two power ground pins on opposite sides of the package. This \nallows the input capacitors to be split, and placed optimally with respect to the internal power MOSFETs, thus \nimproving the effectiveness of the input bypassing. In this example, a single 4.7-µF and two 100-nF ceramic \ncapacitors at each VIN/PGND location.\nMany times, it is desirable to use an electrolytic capacitor on the input in parallel with the ceramics. This is \nespecially true if long leads/traces are used to connect the input supply to the regulator. The moderate ESR \nof this capacitor can help damp any ringing on the input supply caused by the long power leads. The use of \nthis additional capacitor also helps with momentary voltage dips caused by input supplies with unusually high \nimpedance.\nMost of the input switching current passes through the ceramic input capacitor or capacitors. The approximate \nworst case RMS value of this current can be calculated from Equation 8  and must be checked against the \nmanufacturers\' maximum ratings.\n2IIOUT\nRMS#\n(8)\n8.2.2.7 CBOOT\nThe LMR33630-Q1  requires a bootstrap capacitor connected between the BOOT pin and the SW pin. This \ncapacitor stores energy that is used to supply the gate drivers for the power MOSFETs. A high-quality ceramic \ncapacitor of 100 nF and at least 10 V is required.\n8.2.2.8 VCC\nThe VCC pin is the output of the internal LDO used to supply the control circuits of the regulator. This output \nrequires a 1-µF, 16-V ceramic capacitor connected from VCC to GND for proper operation. In general, avoid \nloading this output with any external circuitry. However, this output can be used to supply the pullup for the \npower-good function (see Section 7.3.1 ). A value of 100 k Ω is a good choice in this case. The nominal output \nvoltage on VCC is 5 V; see Section 6.5 for limits. Do not short this output to ground or any other external voltage.\n8.2.2.9 CFF Selection\nIn some cases, a feedforward capacitor can be used across R FBT to improve the load transient response or \nimprove the loop-phase margin. This is especially true when values of R FBT > 100 k Ω are used. Large values of \nRFBT, in combination with the parasitic capacitance at the FB pin, can create a small signal pole that interferes \nwith the loop stability. A C FF can help to mitigate this effect. Equation 9  can be used to estimate the value of C FF. \nThe value found with Equation 9  is a starting point; use lower values to determine if any advantage is gained by \nthe use of a C FF capacitor. The Optimizing Transient Response of Internally Compensated DC-DC Converters \nwith Feed-forward Capacitor Application Report  is helpful when experimenting with a feedforward capacitor.www.ti.comLMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\nOUTREF\nFBTOUT OUT\nFF\nVVR 120C VC\n\x98\x98\x98\x1f(9)\n8.2.2.10 External UVLO\nIn some cases, an input UVLO level different than that provided internal to the device is needed. This can \nbe accomplished by using the circuit shown in Figure 8-2 . The input voltage at which the device turns on is \ndesignated V ON while the turnoff voltage is V OFF.

The effect \nof this power dissipation is to raise the internal temperature of the converter above ambient. The internal die \ntemperature (T J) is a function of the ambient temperature, the power loss, and the effective thermal resistance, \nRθJA, of the device and PCB combination. The maximum internal die temperature for the LMR33630-Q1  must \nbe limited to 125°C . This establishes a limit on the maximum device power dissipation and therefore the \nload current. Equation 11  shows the relationships between the important parameters. It is easy to see that \nlarger ambient temperatures (T A) and larger values of R θJA reduce the maximum available output current. The \nconverter efficiency can be estimated by using the curves provided in this data sheet. If the desired operating \nconditions cannot be found in one of the curves, then interpolation can be used to estimate the efficiency. \nAlternatively, the EVM can be adjusted to match the desired application requirements and the efficiency can be \nmeasured directly. The correct value of R θJA is more difficult to estimate. As stated in the Semiconductor and \nIC Package Thermal Metrics Application Report , the value of R θJA given in Section 6.4 is not valid for design \npurposes and must not be used to estimate the thermal performance of the application. The values reported in \nthat table were measured under a specific set of conditions that are rarely obtained in an actual application.\n\x0b \x0c\n\x0b \x0cOUT JAA J\nMAX OUTV1\n1 RTTI \x98K \x10K\x98\x10 \nT\n(11)\nwhere\n•η = efficiencyLMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\nThe effective R θJA is a critical parameter and depends on many factors such as power dissipation, air \ntemperature/flow, PCB area, copper heat-sink area, number of thermal vias under the package, and adjacent \ncomponent placement, just to mention just a few.

In addition, the input supply must be capable of delivering the required input current to the loaded \nregulator. The average input current can be estimated with Equation 12 , where η is the efficiency.\nK \x98\x98 \nINOUT OUT\nINVI VI\n(12)\nIf the regulator is connected to the input supply through long wires or PCB traces, special care is required to \nachieve good performance. The parasitic inductance and resistance of the input cables can have an adverse \neffect on the operation of the regulator. The parasitic inductance, in combination with the low-ESR, ceramic \ninput capacitors, can form an under damped resonant circuit, resulting in overvoltage transients at the input to \nthe regulator. The parasitic resistance can cause the voltage at the VIN pin to dip whenever a load transient \nis applied to the output. If the application is operating close to the minimum input voltage, this dip can cause \nthe regulator to momentarily shutdown and reset. The best way to solve these kind of issues is to reduce the \ndistance from the input supply to the regulator and/or use an aluminum or tantalum input capacitor in parallel \nwith the ceramics. The moderate ESR of these types of capacitors help damp the input resonant circuit and \nreduce any overshoots. A value in the range of 20 µF to 100 µF is usually sufficient to provide input damping and \nhelp to hold the input voltage steady during large load transients.\nSometimes, for other system considerations, an input filter is used in front of the regulator. This can lead to \ninstability, as well as some of the effects mentioned above, unless it is designed carefully. The user guide \nAN-2162 Simple Success With Conducted EMI From DCDC Converters  provides helpful suggestions when \ndesigning an input filter for any switching regulator.\nIn some cases, a transient voltage suppressor (TVS) is used on the input of regulators. One class of this \ndevice has a snap-back  characteristic (thyristor type). The use of a device with this type of characteristic is not \nrecommended. When the TVS fires, the clamping voltage falls to a very low value. If this voltage is less than \nthe output voltage of the regulator, the output capacitors discharge through the device back to the input. This \nuncontrolled current flow can damage the device.\nThe input voltage must not be allowed to fall below the output voltage. In this scenario, such as a shorted input \ntest, the output capacitors discharges through the internal parasitic diode found between the VIN and SW pins of \nthe device. During this condition, the current can become uncontrolled, possibly causing damage to the device. If \nthis scenario is considered likely, then a Schottky diode between the input supply and the output should be used.www.ti.comLMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nThe PCB layout of any DC/DC converter is critical to the optimal performance of the design. Bad PCB layout can \ndisrupt the operation of an otherwise good schematic design. Even if the converter regulates correctly, bad PCB \nlayout can mean the difference between a robust design and one that cannot be mass produced. Furthermore, \nthe EMI performance of the regulator is dependent on the PCB layout, to a great extent. In a buck converter, \nthe most critical PCB feature is the loop formed by the input capacitor or input capacitors, and power ground, \nas shown in Figure 10-1 . This loop carries large transient currents that can cause large transient voltages when \nreacting with the trace inductance. These unwanted transient voltages will disrupt the proper operation of the \nconverter. Because of this, the traces in this loop must be wide and short, and the loop area as small as possible \nto reduce the parasitic inductance. Figure 10-2  shows a recommended layout for the critical components of the \nLMR33630-Q1.\n1.Place the input capacitor or capacitors as close as possible to the VIN and GND terminals.  VIN and \nGND pins are adjacent, simplifying the input capacitor placement. With the VQFN package there are two \nVIN/PGND pairs on either side of the package. This provides for a symmetrical layout and helps minimize \nswitching noise and EMI generation. A wide VIN plane must be used on a lower layer to connect both of the \nVIN pairs together to the input supply; see the layout example.\n2.Place bypass capacitor for VCC close to the VCC pin.  This capacitor must be placed close to the device \nand routed with short, wide traces to the VCC and GND pins.\n3.Use wide traces for the C BOOT  capacitor.  Place C BOOT  close to the device with short/wide traces to the \nBOOT and SW pins. It is important to route the SW connection under the device to the NC pin, and use this \npath to connect the BOOT capacitor to SW.\n4.Place the feedback divider as close as possible to the FB pin of the device.  Place R FBB, RFBT, and C FF, \nif used, physically close to the device. The connections to FB and GND must be short and close to those \npins on the device. The connection to V OUT can be somewhat longer. However, this latter trace must not be \nrouted near any noise source (such as the SW node) that can capacitively couple into the feedback path of \nthe regulator.\n5.Use at least one ground plane in one of the middle layers.  This plane acts as a noise shield and also act \nas a heat dissipation path.\n6.Provide wide paths for VIN, VOUT, and GND.  Making these paths as wide and direct as possible reduces \nany voltage drops on the input or output paths of the converter and maximizes efficiency.\n7.Provide enough PCB area for proper heat sinking.  As stated in Section 8.2.2.11 , enough copper \narea must be used to ensure a low R θJA, commensurate with the maximum load current and ambient \ntemperature. Make the top and bottom PCB layers with two-ounce copper; and no less than one ounce. \nIf the PCB design uses multiple copper layers (recommended), thermal vias can also be connected to the \ninner layer heat-spreading ground planes.\n8.Keep switch area small.  Keep the copper area connecting the SW pin to the inductor as short and wide as \npossible. At the same time the total area of this node should be minimized to help reduce radiated EMI.\nSee the following PCB layout resources for additional important guidelines:\n•Layout Guidelines for Switching Power Supplies\n•Simple Switcher PCB Layout Guidelines\n•Construction Your Power Supply- Layout Considerations\n•Low Radiated EMI Layout Made Simple with LM4360x and LM4600xLMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n32 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\nCINVIN\nSW\nGNDKEEP \nCURRENT\n LOOP \nSMALLFigure 10-1. Current Loops with Fast Edges\n10.1.1 Ground and Thermal Considerations\nAs mentioned above, TI recommends using one of the middle layers as a solid ground plane. A ground plane \nprovides shielding for sensitive circuits and traces. It also provides a quiet reference potential for the control \ncircuitry. The AGND and PGND pins must be connected to the ground planes using vias next to the bypass \ncapacitors. PGND pins are connected directly to the source of the low side MOSFET switch, and also connected \ndirectly to the grounds of the input and output capacitors. The PGND net contains noise at the switching \nfrequency and can bounce due to load variations. The PGND trace, as well as the VIN and SW traces, must be \nconstrained to one side of the ground planes. The other side of the ground plane contains much less noise and \nmust be used for sensitive routes.\nUse as much copper as possible, for system ground plane, on the top and bottom layers for the best heat \ndissipation. Use a four-layer board with the copper thickness for the four layers, starting from the top as: 2 oz / \n1 oz / 1 oz / 2 oz. A four-layer board with enough copper thickness, and proper layout, provides low current \nconduction impedance, proper shielding, and lower thermal resistance.www.ti.comLMR33630-Q1\nSNVSB26C – JUNE 2018 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 33\nProduct Folder Links: LMR33630-Q1\n10.2 Layout Example\nGNDVOUT\nGND\nHEATSINK\nINNER GND PLANEEN\nPGOODINDUCTOR\nTop Trace/PlaneRFBB\nRFBT\nCVCCCBOOTCOUT COUT COUTCOUT\nCIN CIN\nCHF CHF\nGND\nHEATSINKGNDVOUT\nVIN VIN1\n2\n3\n4\n5 6 7891011 12\nInner GND Plane\nTrace on Signal LayerVIA to Signal Layer\nVIA to GND PlanesVIN Strap on Inner Layer\nVIA to VIN StrapTop\nInner GND Plane\nVIN Strap and \nGND Plane\nSignal traces \nand GND Plane\nFigure 10-2.
