The ON/OFF pinshould notbeleftfloating, as\nthisisnotanensured operating condition. See Figure 15.\n7.3.2 Forcing TheOutput Positive\nDue toaninternal clamp circuit, theLM2991 canwithstand positive voltages onitsoutput.

TI’scustomers are\nresponsible fordetermining suitability ofcomponents fortheir purposes. Customers should\nvalidate andtesttheir design implementation toconfirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe LM2991 isa1-Anegative adjustable voltage regulator with anoperating VINrange of–6Vto–26V,anda\nregulated VOUThaving 5%accuracy with amaximum rated IOUTcurrent of1A.Efficiency isdefined bytheratio of\noutput voltage toinput voltage because theLM2991 isalinear voltage regulator. Toachieve high efficiency, the\ndropout voltage (VIN–VOUT)must beassmall aspossible, thus requiring avery lowdropout LDO.\nSuccessfully implementing anLDO inanapplication depends onthe application requirements. Ifthe\nrequirements aresimply input voltage and output voltage, compliance specifications (such asinternal power\ndissipation orstability) must beverified toensure asolid design. Iftiming, start-up, noise, PSRR, oranyother\ntransient specification isrequired, thedesign becomes more challenging.\n8.2 Typical Application\nFigure 15.LM2991 Typical Application With Adjustable Current Sink\n8.2.1 Design Requirements\nForthisdesign example, usetheparameters listed inTable 1astheinput parameters.\nTable 1.Design Parameters\nDESIGN PARAMETER DESIGN REQUIREMENT\nInput voltage –26Vto–5V\nOutput voltage –2Vto–25V(typical)\nOutput current upto1A\n12LM2991\nSNVS099I –MAY 1999 –REVISED OCTOBER 2016 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: LM2991Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1999 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nAt400-mA loading, thedropout oftheLM2991 has 1-V maximum dropout over temperature, thus an–5V\nheadroom issufficient foroperation over both input andoutput voltage accuracy. The efficiency oftheLM2991 in\nthisconfiguration isVOUT/VIN=50%.\nToachieve thesmallest form factor, theTO-263 (KTT) package isselected. Select input andoutput capacitors in\naccordance with theExternal Capacitors section. Aluminum capacitances of470μFfortheinput and 50-μF\ncapacitors fortheoutput areselected. With anefficiency of50% and a400-mA maximum load, theinternal\npower dissipation is2000 mW, which corresponds to82.5°Cjunction temperature risefortheTO-263 package.\nWith an25°Cambient temperature, thejunction temperature isat107.5 °C.\n8.2.2.1 External Capacitors\nThe LM2991 regulator requires anoutput capacitor tomaintain stability. The capacitor must beatleast 10-μF\naluminum electrolytic or1-μFsolid tantalum. The equivalent series resistance (ESR) oftheoutput capacitor must\nbeless than 10Ω,orthezero added totheregulator frequency response bytheESR could reduce thephase\nmargin, creating oscillations. Aninput capacitor, ofatleast 1-μFsolid tantalum or10-μFaluminum electrolytic, is\nalso needed iftheregulator issituated more than 6inches from theinput power supply filter.\n8.2.2.1.1 Input Capacitor\nTIrecommends asolid tantalum orceramic capacitor whose value isatleast 1μF,butanaluminum electrolytic\n(≥10μF)may beused. However, aluminum electrolytic types should notbeused inapplications where the\nambient temperature can drop below 0°Cbecause their internal impedance increases significantly atcold\ntemperatures.\n8.2.2.1.2 Output Capacitor\nThe output capacitor must meet theESR limits shown inFigure 16,which means itmust have anESR between\nabout 25mΩand10Ω.\nFigure 16.Output Capacitor ESR Range\nAsolid tantalum (value≥1µF)isthebest choice fortheoutput capacitor. Analuminum electrolytic (≥10µF)\nmay beused iftheESR isinthestable range.\nItshould benoted that theESR ofatypical aluminum electrolytic willincrease byasmuch as50×asthe\ntemperature isreduced from 25°Cdown to−40°C,while atantalum exhibits anESR increase ofabout 2×over\nthesame range. Forthisandother reasons, aluminum electrolytics should notbeused inapplications where low\noperating temperatures occur.\nThe lower stable ESR limit of25mΩmeans thatceramic capacitors cannotbeused directly ontheoutput ofan\nLDO. Aceramic (≥2.2µF)canbeused ontheoutput ifsome external resistance isplaced inseries with it(1Ω\nrecommended). Dielectric types X7R orX5R must beused ifthetemperature range oftheapplication varies\nmore than ±25°from ambient toassure theamount ofcapacitance issufficient.\n13LM2991\nwww.ti.com SNVS099I –MAY 1999 –REVISED OCTOBER 2016\nProduct Folder Links: LM2991Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1999 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated8.2.2.2 Ceramic Bypass Capacitors\nMany designers place distributed ceramic capacitors whose value isintherange of1000 pFto0.1µFatthe\npower input pins oftheIC\'sacross acircuit board. These cancause reduced phase margin oroscillations inLDO\nregulators.\nThe advent ofmulti-layer boards with dedicated power andground planes hasremoved thetrace inductance that\n(previously) provided thenecessary "de-coupling" toshield theoutput oftheLDO from theeffects ofbypass\ncapacitors.\nAvoid these capacitors, ifpossible; ifceramic bypass capacitors areused, keep them asfaraway from theLDO\noutput asispractical.\n8.2.2.3 Minimum Load\nAminimum load current of500μAisrequired forproper operation. The external resistor divider canprovide the\nminimum load, with theresistor from theadjust pintoground setto2.4kΩ.\n8.2.2.4 Setting TheOutput Voltage\nTheoutput voltage oftheLM2991 issetexternally byaresistor divider using Equation 1:\nVOUT=VREF×(1+R2/R1)−(IADJ×R2)\nwhere\n•VREF=−1.21 V (1)\nThe output voltage canbeprogrammed within therange of−3Vto−24V,typically aneven greater range of−2\nVto−25V.The adjust pincurrent isabout 60nA,causing aslight error intheoutput voltage. However, using\nresistors lower than 100kΩmakes theerror duetotheadjust pincurrent negligible. Forexample, neglecting the\nadjust pincurrent, andsetting R2to100kΩandVOUTto−5V,results inanoutput voltage error ofonly 0.16%.\n8.2.2.5 Power Dissipation\nKnowing thedevice power dissipation and proper sizing ofthethermal plane connected tothethermal tabis\ncritical toensuring reliable operation. Device power dissipation depends oninput voltage, output voltage, and\nload conditions andcanbecalculated with Equation 2.\nPD(MAX) =(VIN(MAX) –VOUT)×IOUT (2)\nPower dissipation can beminimized, and greater efficiency can beachieved, byusing thelowest available\nvoltage drop option thatwould stillbegreater than thedropout voltage (VDO).However, keep inmind thathigher\nvoltage drops result inbetter dynamic (that is,PSRR andtransient) performance.\nPower dissipation andjunction temperature aremost often related bythejunction-to-ambient thermal resistance\n(RθJA)ofthecombined PCB and device package and thetemperature oftheambient air(TA),according to\nEquation 3orEquation 4:\nTJ(MAX) =TA(MAX) +(RθJA×PD(MAX) ) (3)\nPD(MAX) =(TJ(MAX) –TA(MAX) )/RθJA (4)\nUnfortunately, thisRθJAishighly dependent ontheheat-spreading capability oftheparticular PCB design, and\ntherefore varies according tothetotal copper area, copper weight, andlocation oftheplanes. The RθJArecorded\ninThermal Information isdetermined bythespecific EIA/JEDEC JESD51-7 standard forPCB and copper-\nspreading area, and istobeused only asarelative measure ofpackage thermal performance. Forawell-\ndesigned thermal layout, RθJAisactually thesum ofthepackage junction-to-case (bottom) thermal resistance\n(RθJCbot)plus thethermal resistance contribution bythePCB copper area acting asaheat sink.\n14LM2991\nSNVS099I –MAY 1999 –REVISED OCTOBER 2016 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: LM2991Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1999 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated8.2.2.6 Estimating Junction Temperature\nThe EIA/JEDEC standard recommends theuse ofpsi(Ψ)thermal characteristics toestimate thejunction\ntemperatures ofsurface mount devices onatypical PCB board application.

The ground connections forCINand COUTmust beback totheLM2991 GND pin\nusing aswide andshort ofacopper trace asispractical.\nGood PClayout practices must beused orinstability canbeinduced because ofground loops andvoltage drops.\nThe input andoutput capacitors must bedirectly connected totheIN,OUT, andGND pins oftheLM2991 using\ntraces which donothave other currents flowing inthem (Kelvin connect). Thebest way todothisistolayoutCIN\nand COUTnear thedevice with short traces totheIN,OUT, and GND pins. The regulator ground pinmust be\nconnected totheexternal circuit ground sothattheregulator anditscapacitors have asingle-point ground.\nStability problems have been seen inapplications where vias toaninternal ground plane were used atthe\nground points oftheLM2991 device and theinput and output capacitors. This was caused byvarying ground\npotentials atthese nodes resulting from current flowing through theground plane. Using asingle point ground\ntechnique fortheregulator anditscapacitors fixed theproblem.\nBecause high current flows through thetraces going intotheINpinandcoming from theOUT pin,Kelvin connect\nthecapacitor leads tothese pins sothere isnovoltage drop inseries with theinput andoutput capacitors.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 20.LM2991 TO-263 Board Layout\n17LM2991\nwww.ti.com SNVS099I –MAY 1999 –REVISED OCTOBER 2016\nProduct Folder Links: LM2991Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1999 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated11Device andDocumentation Support\n11.1 Device Support\n11.1.1 Device Nomenclature\nDropout Voltage: Theinput-output voltage differential atwhich thecircuit ceases toregulate against further\nreduction ininput voltage.
