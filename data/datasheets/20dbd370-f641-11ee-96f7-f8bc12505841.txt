Using the product in such specific environments or service conditions, \ntherefore, may affect the performance of the product. \nCheck with us about the performance and reliability of the product first before using the product.\n(1) Used at a temperature higher than the upper limit category temperature or lower than the lower limit category \ntemperature.\n(2) Used in an environment where the product is directly exposed to water, salt water, oil, etc., or in a liquid, such as water,\noil, chemicals, and organic solvents.\n(3) Used in an outdoor environment where the product is exposed to direct sunlight, ozone, radiation, UV-rays, etc., or in\na dusty place.\n(4) Used in a wet place (dew concentration on a resistor, water leakage, etc.), a place exposed to sea breeze, or a place \nfilled with a corrosive gas, such as Cl2, H2S, NH3, SO2, or NOX.\n(5) Used in an environment filled with a toxic gas (hydrogen sulfide, sulfurous acid, nitrous acid, chlorine and chlorine\ncompound, bromine and bromine compound, ammonia, etc.)\n(6) Used in an environment where static electricity and electromagnetic waves are strong.\n(7) Located close to  heating component or a flammable material, such as a vinyl cable. \n(8) Sealed with a resin, etc.\n(9) Cleansed with a solvent, water, or a water-soluble cleaner, to remove solder flux after soldering.\n(10) Used in an environment where an acidic or alkali atmosphere is present.\n(11) Used in an environment where excessive vibration or mechanical shocks exceeding a specified range is applied to the \nproduct (even if the applied vibration or mechanical shocks is within the specified range, it may cause the product to \nresonate, in which a large vibration acceleration may be generated. Make sure to evaluate/check such vibrations or \nimpacts applied to the product in an actual service condition).\n(12) Used under a low atmospheric pressure condition or depressurized condition.\n■ The capacitor withstands an immersion cleaning process where the board carrying the product is immersed in a cleaning\nsolution of 60 ℃  or lower for less than 5 minutes and withstands an ultrasonic cleaning process as well. However, ensure\nto thoroughly rinse and dry it. Some cleaning methods erase or blur notes on the capacitor in some cases. \nSome types of capacitors are not washable and some cleaning solutions cannot be used to clean a capacitor. \nIf you are not sure about which type of capacitor is not washable or which cleaning solution cannot be used, please \ncontact us. Solvents you can use to clean the board are as follows.\nPine Alpha ST-100S, Aqua Cleaner 210SEP, Cleanthrough 750H/750L/710M, Sun Elec B-12, Techno Cleaner 219, \nCold Cleaner P3-375, DK Be clear CW-5790, Terpene Cleaner EC-7R, Techno Care FRW-17/FRW-1/FRV-1\n■ Keep the cleaning solution under strict contamination control (conductivity, pH, specific gravity, water content, etc.).\nA contaminated cleaning solution will show a high chlorine concentration, thereby corroding the interior of the capacitor \nin some cases. Keep the flux concentration in the cleaning solution at a 2% mass or less.\n■ Unless otherwise specified in the specifications, avoid cleaning the capacitor with a halogen-based solvent, an alkaline\nsolvent, a petroleum-based solvent, xylene, or acetone. Using a halogen-based solvent may result in a case where the solvent infiltrates (leaks) into the capacitor and break-down releasing chlorine, which reacts with aluminum which can corrode the capacitor interior. 1-1-1 trichloroethane is particularly harmful to a capacitor. Never use it to clean a capacitor.\nA alkaline solvent may corrode (dissolve) an aluminum case, a petroleum-based solvent and xylene may damage the \nsealing rubber and accelerate its deterioration, and acetone may erase notes on the capacitor. \nTo protect the global environment, refrain from using an ozone depleting substance as the cleaning solution.\n■ Right after the board cleaning, subject the capacitor to a forced drying process so that no cleaning solution remains\nbetween the sealing part of the capacitor and the printed board.\nSet a drying temperature equal to or lower than the upper limit category temperature.\n■ When an adhesive or coating agent is used to fix the capacitor and prevent dampening of the board, specific types of\nsolvents included in some adhesives or coating agents may corrode the capacitor. Select a non-halogen solvent for the \nmaterial making up the adhesive or coating agent. Do not use a chloroprene-based polymer.\nSolidify and dry the adhesive or coating agent sufficiently to prevent its solvent component from remaining on the capacitor.\nLeave at least 1/3 of the sealing part unsealed on the surface to which the adhesive or coating agent is applied.\n1-Dec-23\u3000Use environments and cleaning conditionsMatters to Be Observed When Using This Product\n(Conductive polymer hybrid aluminum electrolytic capacitor / Aluminum electrolytic capacitor)\n\nMatters to Be Observed When Using This Product\n■ Do not use the product in a structure sealed by potting or molding. The pressure of a molding resin on a capacitor may\ndeform the capacitor. In addition, the resin covering the capacitor may affect its heat dissipation performance or may leak  \ninto the product. These factors lead to the significant degradation of the capacitor’s characteristics and reliability.  There is also a concern that an electrolytic solution permeating the sealing rubber may agglomerate and cause a short \ncircuit.\n■ When the capacitor is used in a circuit where an impact voltage is applied or a high voltage is applied in a short period\n(transient phenomenon) or a high pulse voltage is applied, make sure to use the capacitor at a voltage equal to or \nlower than its rated voltage.\n■ The product contains an electrolytic. Improper use of the capacitor leads not only to the rapid degradation of its\ncharacteristics but also to electrolytic leakage. These problems damage the circuit board and may lead to destruction \nof the entire circuit set.\n■ When you see gas coming out of an activated pressure relief valve of a capacitor during use of a circuit set, turn off the\nmain power supply of the circuit set or pull the power cord plug out of the wall-outlet. If you leave the power supply on and \nthe capacitor short-circuits, it will damage the circuit, or the gas can turn into a liquid, which will cause the circuit to short. In the worst case scenarios, these events may develop into a more serious incident, such as burnout of the circuit set.\nThe gas coming out of the pressure relief valve of a capacitor is not smoke, but is the electrolytic solution in its gaseous \nstate.\n■ When the pressure valve of the capacitor is activated, it emits a high-temperature gas of over 100 ℃ . Do not bring your\nface near the valve. In case the gas jetting out of the valve gets in your eyes or comes into your mouth, wash your eyes \nwith water or rinse your mouth immediately. If the gas hits your skin, wash it away with soap.\n■ If you touch a terminal of the product during use of the circuit set, you will get an electric shock. The aluminum case of\nthe product has an exposed part with no insulation. Do not touch the exposed part because it is as dangerous as the terminal.\n■ Do not create a short circuit between terminals of the product by inserting a conductor therebetween. Do not splash a\nconductive solution, such as an acidic or alkali solution, on the capacitor. It puts the capacitor in a shorted state, which causes the circuit to fail and destroys the capacitor as well.\n■ When a silicone material containing a relatively large amount of a low-molecular-weight siloxane is located close to the\nproduct, it may cause the capacitor problems with its electrical performance.\n■ When electronic equipment having the capacitor built therein is exported to overseas markets, wooden packaging\nmaterials are fumigated with a halogen compound, such as methyl bromide. In such cases, if the packaging material subjected to the fumigation treatment is not dried sufficiently, halogen remaining on the packaging material may leach \ninto the capacitor during transportation and trigger a corrosive reaction in the capacitor. When carrying out the fumigation \ntreatment, carefully examine the dried packaging material to confirm that no halogen remains on the packaging material. Never fumigate the entire electronic equipment in its packaged state.\n■ The product life is affected by temperatures. In general, a 10 ℃  drop in the temperature will double the life.\nUse the capacitor at a temperature as low as possible from the upper limit category temperature.\n■ Using a capacitor under a temperature condition outside a specified temperature range causes heavy degradation of the\ncapacitor characteristics, which may result in breakage of the capacitor. You need to confirm not only the ambient \ntemperature and internal temperature of the capacitor but also the temperature of the capacitor’s top surface, which is \ngiven by radiant heat from built-in heating elements (a power transistor, IC, resistance, etc.) and heat generated by \nself-heating induced by ripple current. Do not place a heating element on the back of the capacitor.\n1-Dec-23\u3000Response to anomalies and handling conditions\n\u3000Reliability and product life\n\nMatters to Be Observed When Using This Product\n■ The product life is given by the following equation.\nL2 = L1 x 2\n  ≧\n L1 : Guaranteed life (h) at temperature T 1 (℃)\nL2 : Expected life (h) at temperature T 2 (℃) * In the case of a hybrid type, category temperature ( ℃)\nT1 : Upper category temperature ( ℃)  + temperature increase caused by rated ripple current ( ℃)\nT2 : Ambient temperature of capacitor ( ℃)\n⊿T: Temperature increase caused by ripple current ( ℃)\n■ Do not use the product for a period longer than its specified service life. A capacitor with its service life ended may\ncause the following problems: rapid degradation of the product characteristics, short circuit, unnecessary activation of \nthe pressure valve, electrolytic solution leakage, etc. Note that the estimated service life is not longer than 15 years due \nto the limited environment-resistant property of the sealing rubber.\n■ When the capacitor is used under a high-temperature condition for a long period, minute cracks develop on the surface\nof the sealing rubber or the case surface turns brown in some cases. These phenomena, however, have no effects on \nthe reliability of the capacitor.\n■ A capacitor conforming to "AEC-Q200" refers to a capacitor having passed some or all of evaluation test items defined\nin AEC-Q200.To know the detailed specifications of each capacitor or specific evaluation test scores, please contact us.\nWe issue a the product specifications sheet for each product ordered. Please confirm the product specifications \nsheet when\u3000you place an order to us.\n■ The electrical characteristics change as a result of temperature/frequency fluctuations. Take electrical characteristic\nchanges into consideration when working out a circuit design.\n(1) Temperature fluctuations\nHigh-temperature condition : increase in leak current\nLow-temperature condition : decrease in capacitance, increase in the tangent to the loss angle, \nincrease in impedance (the hybrid type is excluded), etc.\n(2) Frequency fluctuations\nHigh-frequency condition : decrease in capacitance, increase in the tangent to the loss angle, \ndecrease in impedance, etc.\nLow-frequency condition : more heat generation by ripple current as a result of an increase in \nequivalent series resistance\n■ The group of factors described below may lead to rapid degradation of the capacitor characteristics, short circuit, or\nelectrolytic solution leakage. They may give rise to sharp heat/gas generation, too, in which case the increasing internal \npressure actuates the pressure valve, causes the electrolytic solution to leak out of the sealing part, and, in a worst-case \nscenario, causes an explosion or ignition incident. When a capacitor bursts, it may scatter flammable materials \n(electrolytic solution, etc.) in its surroundings.\n(1) Reverse voltage: The capacitor has preset polarity. Do not apply a reverse voltage to the capacitor.\nConfirm the polarity indicated on the capacitor and then use it.\n(2) Charge/discharge: Avoid using the capacitor in a circuit that frequently repeats sharp charge/discharge cycles or a\ncircuit that requires \u3000relatively slow but highly frequent charge/discharge cycles. In cases where you use the capacitor\nin such circuits, make sure to inform us of the charge/discharge conditions.\nEnsure that a rush current does not exceed 100 A.\n(3) ON/OFF: Avoid using the capacitor in an on/off circuit that repeatedly switches on and off more than 10,000 times a \nday. In cases where you use the product in such circuits, make sure to inform us of the circuit conditions, etc.\n(4) Overvoltage: Do not apply an overvoltage higher than the rated voltage (higher than the surge voltage when the\nvoltage application period is short). A peak value given by superposing a ripple voltage (AC component) on a DC \nvoltage must be equal to or lower than the rated voltage.\n(5) Ripple current: Do not allow an excessively large ripple current (larger than the rated ripple current specified in the \nspecifications) to flow through the capacitor. Even if a ripple current flow in the capacitor is equal to or smaller than the rated ripple current, a reverse voltage flow may be generated in the capacitor when the DC bias voltage is low flow in the capacitor. Keep the ripple current flow within a range in which no reverse voltage is generated.Even if the ripple current flow is kept equal to or smaller than the rated ripple current, using the capacitor for a period longer than its service life intensifies the degradation of the ESR characteristics, resulting in an increase in internal heating caused by the ripple current. As a result, the pressure valve is actuated, the exterior case or rubber swells, the electrolytic solution leaks, and, in a worst-case scenario, the capacitor short-circuits and ignites or explodes.\n1-Dec-23\u3000Circuit design and circuit board design\nT1-(T2+⊿T)\n10\nMatters to Be Observed When Using This Product\n■ Because the impedance of the capacitor is close to the circuit impedance, capacitors connected in parallel in the circuit\nmay damage the whole current balance, in which, a ripple current higher than the rated ripple current may flow in some of \nthe capacitors. To prevent concentration of ripple current on the low-impedance side, use capacitors with the same part \nnumber and avoid the partiality of cable impedances. Do not use capacitors connected in series.\n■ When the capacitor is mounted on a double-side wiring board, do not place the wiring pattern directly underneath where\nthe product is mounted. In case the electrolytic solution leaks out, it may short-circuit the pattern and cause tracking or migration. Consider a case where the product is a radial lead capacitor and is mounted on a board with through-holes. \nIn this case, if the sealing part of the capacitor and the board surface stick close to each other, solder flows up to  the \ncapacitor during a dip soldering process, which may cause short circuit between the anode and cathode of the capacitor.In such a case, the outer laminate of the product may be damaged. The position of holes, therefore, must be \ndetermined properly.\n■ When designing a printed board carrying radial lead capacitors, make through-holes across the gap equal to the gap\nbetween the leads (terminals) of the capacitor. If the gap between the through-holes is narrower or wider than the gap \nbetween the leads, stress is applied to the leads when the capacitor is inserted in the holes. \nThis may result in increasing leak current, short circuit, wire breaking, or electrolytic solution leakage.\n■ A capacitor which has the pressure valve on the case must be provided with a space formed above the pressure valve\nso that the pressure valve operates without hinderance. When the product is 6.3 mm to 16 mm in diameter, form a space of 2 mm or larger. When the product is 18 mm in diameter, form a space of 3 mm or larger.\nIf the space is not large enough, it will impair the operability of the pressure valve and may lead to an explosion \nincident.\n■ Design the circuit in such that the pattern, especially a line pattern carrying high voltage or large current, is not\nformed above the pressure valve. Upon its activation, the pressure valve emits a flammable high-temperature gas of over 100 ℃ . This may cause a secondary accident, such as the gas condensing on the pattern and the wire \nsheathing being melted and catching on fire.\n■ Be careful with resonance of the capacitor mounted on the board. When a large load is applied to the capacitor at the\nfrequency close to the resonance frequency, it may cause the capacitor to come off or widely change its characteristics.\n■ Completely isolate the case of the capacitor from the cathode terminal and the circuit pattern.\n■ The laminate or outer sleeve covering of the product is for displaying information on the product and does not\nhave a guaranteed insulating function.\nThe laminate may turn brown under a high-temperature condition. However, that does not cause problems with \nmarkings recognition on the product surface or electrical performance.\nThe outer sleeve may crack when dipped in a xylene or toluene solution and exposed to high temperature.\n■ Do not reuse a capacitor that was incorporated in a circuit set and energized in the past. Do not use a capacitor that\nwas dropped on the floor.\nDo not use a capacitor in its compressed form. Compressing the capacitor makes it less airtight, resulting in poor \nperformance, shorter guaranteed life, and electrolyte leakage.\n■ A re-striking voltage is generated in a capacitor in some cases. In such a case, let the capacitor discharge through\na resistor of about 1 kΩ.\n■ When a capacitor is kept in storage for a long period, you may find the leak current from the capacitor has increased.\nIn such a case, make voltage adjustment through a resistor of about 1 kΩ.\n■ Before mounting the capacitor on the board, confirm the ratings (capacitance, rated voltage, etc.) and polarity of the\ncapacitor. Before mounting a surface-mounted type capacitor, confirm its terminal dimensions and land size. \nBefore mounting a radial lead type capacitor, confirm its terminal interval and hole interval. If the terminal interval is not the specified one, stress is applied to internal elements, which may cause problems, such as a short circuit \nand insufficient mounting strength.\nWhen the terminal interval and the hole interval of the radial lead type capacitor do not match and therefore the capacitor’s leads need to be readjusted, make sure that the readjustment does not apply any stress to the capacitor’s \nbody.\n\u3000\n1-Dec-23\u3000Mounting conditions\n\nMatters to Be Observed When Using This Product\n■ Confirm the applied pressure when using an automatically mounting process for a surface-mounted type capacitor.\nExcessive pressure may result in increasing leak current, short circuit, the capacitor coming off from the board, and the \nlike. When automatically mounting the radial lead type capacitor, check the wear of a cutter for cutting the leads and \nconfirm that the angle of clinching the leads is not too acute with regards to the board. Clinching the leads at too acute \nof an angle applies tensile stress to the leads, which may lead to destruction of the capacitor.\n■ Follow soldering conditions (preheating, soldering temperature/time, the number of soldering, etc.)  in the specification\nsheet. A high peak temperature or a long heating time causes the degradation of electrical characteristics or a reduction \nin the guaranteed life. Note that the specified soldering conditions indicate conditions under which the degradation of capacitor characteristics do not occur but do not indicate conditions under which stable soldering can be performed. \nCheck and set conditions under which stable soldering can be performed, on a case-by-case basis. Measure the \ntemperature of the capacitor, using a thermocouple bonded to the top of the capacitor with an epoxy-based adhesive. \nThis temperature measurement must be conducted in a mass-production setup.\n■ The surface-mounted type capacitor is soldered by reflow soldering only. It cannot be soldered by flow soldering or\ndip soldering. Carry out reflow soldering with an atmospheric heat transfer method using infrared hot air, etc. \nWhen carrying out two rounds of reflow processes, carry out the second reflow process after the capacitor’s \ntemperature settles down to a normal temperature. In the case of VPS reflow, a sharp rise in the capacitor \ntemperature causes a change in the characteristics and appearance of the capacitor, which may give rise to a problem \nwith capacitor mounting. We therefore recommend execution of VPS flow at a temperature rise rate of 3 ℃ /second or\nlower. For more information about this matter, please contact us.\n■ Reflow soldering, under the reflow conditions we recommend, might result in discoloring or swelling of the case or\ncrack formation on the ink mark indicating the cathode. These minor problems, however, do not affect the reliability \nof the capacitor at all.\n■ A 6.3-mm diameter vibration-resistant capacitor has a structure that covers the auxiliary terminals to the sides of a\nseat plate. In cases where you confirm formation of a fillet on the sides of the auxiliary terminals by an image  \nrecognition means, etc., examine soldering conditions for the formation of a sufficient fillet on the auxiliary terminals \nin advance before carrying out the soldering process.\nEven if the formation of a sufficient fillet on the auxiliary terminals is not confirmed, a solder junction between the \nlower surface of the auxiliary terminals and the board ensures vibration-resistant performance, meaning the \nreliability of the capacitor is not affected.\n■ The radial lead type capacitor cannot be soldered by reflow soldering. Do not dip the capacitor body, except the leads,\nin solder. Heat from the solder raises the internal pressure of the capacitor and destroys it. Solder the capacitor \naccording to the following soldering conditions: soldering temperature of 260 ℃  ±5 ℃  and soldering time of\n10 seconds ±1 second.\n■ Ensure that other components do not come in contact with the capacitor during the soldering process. When a\nradial lead type capacitor is set in close contact with the board, check the soldered state of the capacitor well, because its sealing rubber has no venting structure.\n■ When manually soldering the capacitor, follow the soldering conditions (soldering temperature/time) specified in the\nspecification sheet or adopt a soldering temperature of 350 ℃  and a soldering time of 3 seconds or less.\nWhen you need to remove a capacitor already soldered, remove it after the solder is melted sufficiently so that no \nstress is applied to the terminals of the capacitor. Be careful not to let the solder iron tip touch the capacitor.\nThe solder iron touching the capacitor may damage the capacitor.\n■ When the temperature of the capacitor becomes extremely high due to preheating, solidification of the setting resin,\netc., may cause the outer sleeve of the capacitor to shrink or crack. When treating the capacitor in a thermosetting \nfurnace, etc., place the capacitor in an atmosphere of 150 ℃  for 2 minutes or less.\n■ Do not tilt or twist the capacitor soldered to a printed board or hold the capacitor to carry the board or hit the capacitor\nagainst something. Such actions apply a force to the internal elements through the terminals and may destroy the \nproduct.\n■ Using highly active halogenous (chlorine-based or bromic) solder flux poses a concern that residual solder flux\nwill have negative impact on the performance and reliability of the capacitor. Check the influence of residual solder flux before using such solder flux.\n1-Dec-23\n\nMatters to Be Observed When Using This Product / Reference information\n■ A capacitor left for a long period is prone to have a greater flow of leak current. This happens because the oxide film\ndeteriorates under a no-load condition. Voltage application to the capacitor reduces the leak current. \nHowever, at the start of voltage application, a large flow of film recovery current increases the leak current, which may \ncause a circuit failure, etc.\n■ The storage period of a capacitor is 42 months from the shipment inspection day. However, the storage period of\ncapacitors not listed in the following table is specified as 12 months.Store the capacitor in a place where a normal temperature condition (5°C to 35°C) and a normal humidity condition \n(45% to 85%) are maintained and direct sunlight is blocked.\n■ Avoid storing the capacitor in environments not specified in the delivery specification sheet or in the following\nenvironments or conditions.\n(1) Used at a temperature higher than the upper limit category temperature or lower than the lower limit category \ntemperature\n(2) Environments where the capacitor is exposed to water, salt water, or oil\n(3) Environments where dew concentrates on the capacitor\n(4) Environments filled with a toxic gas (hydrogen sulfide, sulfurous acid, nitrous acid, chlorine and chlorine compound, \nbromine and bromine compound, ammonia, etc.)\n(5) Environments where the product is exposed to ozone, radiation, UV-rays, etc.(6) Environments where vibrations or mechanical shocks exceeding a specified range is applied to the capacitor\nSome of the product use guidelines described herein are excerpted from JEITA RCR-2367D "Safety application guide \nfor fixed aluminum electrolytic capacitors for use in electronic equipment," a technical report issued by the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association on October 2017.
