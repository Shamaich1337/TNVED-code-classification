The measurement points \nfor input reflected ripple current is showed above. \nFigure3. Input Reflected Ripple Current Test Setup  \n \n \nNote: Scope measurements should be made using a BNC \nsocket with a 1µF ceramic capacitor and a 10µF \ntantalum capacitor. Position the oscilloscope probe \nbetween 51mm and 76mm(2in and 3in) from the \nmodule \nFigure4. Peak-to-Peak Output Ripple Test Setup \n \nDesign Considerations  \nInput filtering  \nThe power module should be connected to a low ac-\nimpedance input source. Highly inductive source \nimpedances can affect the stability of the power module. For the test configuration in Figure3 a 47µF aluminum \nelectrolytic capacitor, mounted close to the power module \nhelps ensure stability of the unit.  \n  \n Safety Considerations \nFor safety-agency approval of the system in which the power \nmodule is used, the power module must be installed in \ncompliance with the spacing and separation requirements of \nthe end-use safety agency standard, i.e. CAN/CSA-C22.2, \nNo. 60950-1 and IEC60950-1, and also compliance with \nUL62368-1, CAN/CSA C22.2 No. 62368-1-14, EN62368-1 \nand IEC62368-1, if the system in which the power module is \nto be used must meet safety agency requirements.  \nBasic insulation based on 75Vdc input is provided between \nthe input and output of the module for the purpose of applying insulation requirements when the input to this DC-\nto-DC converter is identified as TNV-2 or SELV. An \nadditional evaluation is needed if the source is other than \nTNV-2 or SELV. \n When the input source is SELV circuit, the power module meets SELV (safety extra-low voltage) requirements. If the \ninput source is a hazardous voltage which is greater than \n60Vdc and less than or equal to 75Vdc, for the module’s \noutput to meet SELV requirements, all of the following must be met: \n\uf06e The input source must be insulated from the ac mains \nby reinforced or double insulation. \n\uf06e The input terminals of the module are not operator \naccessible. \n\uf06e If the metal baseplate is grounded, one Vi pin and one \nVo pin shall also be grounded. \n\uf06e A SELV reliability test is conducted on the system \nwhere the module is used, in combination with the \nmodule, to ensure that under a single fault, hazardous \nvoltage does not appear at the module’s output. \nWhen installed into a Class II equipment (without \ngrounding), spacing consideration should be given to the \nend-use installation, as the spacing between the module \nand mounting surface have not been evaluated. \n The power module has extra-low voltage (ELV) outputs \nwhen all inputs are ELV. \n This power module is not internally fused. To achieve \noptimum safety and system protec tion, an input line fuse is \nhighly recommended. The safety agencies require a \nnormal-blow fuse with 14A maximum rating to be installed \nin the ungrounded lead. A lower rated fuse can be used \n                       \n  \n \nD o c u m e n t  N o .  S L N 0 W 9 2 .

This power module is positive \nlogic, which turns the module on when the REM pin is at \nlogic high and off when it is at logic low. We also provide negative logic remote On/Off which turns the module on \nduring logic low and off during logic high. \n To turn the power module on and off, the user must supply a \nswitch to control the voltage between the REM pin and -Vin \nterminal (see Figure5). A logic low is V\nREM = -0.7 V to 0.8 V.  \nDuring logic high, the maximum V REM voltage generated by \nthe power module is 20V.   If not using the remote on/off feature, perform one of the following to turn the converter on: \nFor negative logic, short REM pin to -Vin.  \nFor positive logic, leave REM pin open. \n \nFigure5. Remote On/Off Application Circuit  \nOutput Voltage Set-Point Adjustment \nOutput voltage trim allows the user to increase or decrease \nthe output voltage set point of a module. This is accomplished by connecting an external resistor between the TRIM pin and either the Vo1 or GND pins. The trim resistor \nshould be positioned close to the module. If not using the trim \nfeature, leave the TRIM pin open. \nTo increase the output voltage, refer to Figure 6. A trim \nresistor, R\ntrimup, should be connected between the TRIM and \nVo1, with a value of: trimupR= \uf057\uf02d\uf044\uf02d\uf044\uf044\uf02bKVOUT)22.10511\n*225.1) 100(*11.5*(  \ntrimupR= Required value of trim-up resistor [k Ω] \n100\uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d\uf044\nOUTOUT trimup\nVV V\n \nOUTV   = Nominal value of output voltage [V] \ntrimupV = Desired (trimmed) output voltage [V] \n \nFigure6.

Circuit Configuration to Decrease Output \nVoltage. \n \nProtection Feature \nInput Under Voltage Protection \nAt input voltages below the input under-voltage lockout limit, the module operation is disabled. The module will begin to \noperate at an input voltage above the under-voltage lockout \nturn-on threshold.  \n \nOutput Overvoltage Protection \nThe output over-voltage protection consists of circuitry that \nmonitors the voltage of the output terminals. If the output \nvoltage exceeds the over-voltage protection threshold, then \nthe module will operate in a hiccup mode until the \novervoltage cause is cleared.  \n \nOutput Over Current Protection To provide protection in an output overload fault condition, the module is equipped with internal current-limiting circuitry, \nand can endure current limiting for an unlimited duration. At \nthe instance of current-limit in ception, the module enters a \n"hiccup" mode of operation, whereby it shuts down and \nautomatically attempts to rest art. While the fault condition \nexists, the module will remain in this mode until the fault is cleared. The unit operates normally once the output current \nis reduced back into its specified range.  \n \nOver Temperature Protection  \nTo provide protection under certain fault conditions, the \nmodule is equipped with a thermal shutdown circuit. The \nmodule will shutdown when the Tred temperature exceeds \nOTP set value, but the thermal shutdown is not intended as \na guarantee that the module will survive when the \ntemperature beyond its rating. The module will automatically restarts after it cools down. \n \nFigure 8  Tref Temperature Measurement Location \n \nInput Under Voltage Lockout  \nInput under voltage lockout is standard with this converter, \nwhen input voltages below the input under voltage lockout \nlimit, the module operation is disabled. It will only begin to operate once the input voltage is raised above the under voltage lockout turn-on threshold. \n \nThermal Considerations \nThe power modules operate in a variety of thermal environments; however, sufficient cooling should be \nprovided to help ensure reliable operation of the unit. Heat \nis removed by conduction, convection, and radiation to the \nsurrounding environment.  \n \nConsiderations include ambi ent temperature, airflow, \nmodule power dissipation, and the need for increased \nreliability. A reduction in the operating temperature of the module will result in an increase in reliability. \n \n \nHeat Transfer via Convection \nIncreased airflow over the module enhances the heat transfer via convection.

Recommended Airflow Direction  \n \nSoldering Information （Surface \nmounting  Version） \nReflow Soldering Information \nThese power modules are large mass, low thermal \nresistance devices and typically heat up slower than other \nSMT components. It is recommended that the customer \nreview data sheets in order to  customize the solder reflow \nprofile for each application board assembly. The following instructions must be observed when SMT \nsoldering these units. Failure to observe these instructions \nmay result in the failure of or cause damage to the modules, and can adversely affect long-term reliability.  Typically, the eutectic solder melts at 217 ℃, wets the land, \nand subsequently wicks the device connection. Sufficient \ntime must be allowed to fuse the plating on the connection to ensure a reliable solder joint. There are several types of \nSMT reflow technologies currently used in the industry. \nThese surface mount power modules can be reliably \nsoldered using natural forced convection, IR (radiant \ninfrared), or a combination of  convection/IR. For reliable \nsoldering the solder reflow profile should be established by \naccurately measuring the modules pin connector \ntemperatures.  \nLead-free (Pb-free) solder processes \nFor Pb-free solder processes, a pin temperature (TPIN) in \nexcess of the solder melting temperature (TL, +217 to \n+221°C for Sn/Ag/Cu solder alloys) for more than 30 seconds, and a peak temperature of +235°C on all solder \njoints is recommended to ensure a reliable solder joint.\n For Pb-free solder processes, the product is qualified for \nMSL 3 according to IPC/JEDEC standard J-STD-020C. \n     \nFigure10.
