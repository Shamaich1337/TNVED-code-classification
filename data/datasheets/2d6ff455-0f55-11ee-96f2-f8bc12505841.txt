General description\nThe 74LVC125A is a quad buffer/line driver with 3-state outputs controlled by the output enable\ninputs (n OE). A HIGH on n OE causes the outputs to assume a high impedance OFF-state. Inputs\ncan be driven from either 3.3 V or 5 V devices. This feature allows the use of these devices as\ntranslators in mixed 3.3 V and 5 V environments.\nSchmitt-trigger action at all inputs makes the circuit tolerant of slower input rise and fall times.\nThis device is fully specified for partial power down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry\ndisables the output, preventing the potentially damaging backflow current through the device when\nit is powered down.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Overvoltage tolerant inputs to 5.5 V\n•Wide supply voltage range from 1.2 V to 3.6 V\n•CMOS low power consumption\n•Direct interface with TTL levels\n•Complies with JEDEC standard:\n•JESD8-7A (1.65 V to 1.95 V)\n•JESD8-5A (2.3 V to 2.7 V)\n•JESD8-C/JESD36 (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•IOFF circuitry provides partial Power-down mode operation\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM JESD22-A114F exceeds 2000 V\n•MM JESD22-A115-B exceeds 200 V\n•CDM JESD22-C101E exceeds 1000 V\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\n3.

### Component Summary: 74LVC125AD

**General Description:**
The 74LVC125A is a quad buffer/line driver featuring 3-state outputs controlled by output enable inputs (nOE). It is designed to interface with both 3.3 V and 5 V devices, making it suitable for mixed voltage environments. The device includes Schmitt-trigger inputs for improved tolerance to slower input signals and is equipped with I_OFF circuitry to prevent backflow current during power-down conditions.

### Key Specifications:
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VCC): 1.2 V to 3.6 V (functional), absolute maximum of 6.5 V
  - Input Voltage: 0 V to 5.5 V
  - Output Voltage: 0 V to VCC (with 3-state output up to 5.5 V)

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Current: ±50 mA
  - Supply Current (ICC): 100 mA maximum

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Total Power Dissipation: 500 mW (derates with temperature)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +125 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - SO14 (SOT108-1), TSSOP14 (SOT402-1), DHVQFN14 (SOT762-1)

- **Special Features:**
  - Overvoltage tolerant inputs (up to 5.5 V)
  - ESD protection: HBM > 2000 V, MM > 200 V, CDM > 1000 V
  - Schmitt-trigger inputs for slow signal rise/fall times
  - Partial power-down mode operation with I_OFF

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level: Not specified in the provided data.

### Description:
The 74LVC125A is a CMOS quad buffer/line driver that provides high-speed signal buffering and level shifting capabilities. It is particularly useful in applications where signals need to be translated between different voltage levels, such as interfacing 3.3 V logic with 5 V systems. The device's 3-state outputs allow for multiple devices to share a common bus without interference.

### Typical Applications:
- **Signal Conditioning:** Used to buffer and drive signals in digital circuits.
- **Level Shifting:** Facilitates communication between devices operating at different voltage levels.
- **Data Bus Systems:** Ideal for applications requiring multiple drivers on a shared bus.
- **Mixed Voltage Systems:** Suitable for environments where both 3.3 V and 5 V devices are present.

This component is widely used in consumer electronics, telecommunications, and industrial applications where reliable signal integrity and voltage compatibility are critical.
