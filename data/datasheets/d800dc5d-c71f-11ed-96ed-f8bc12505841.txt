The device operates either with a \ncommon input supply or independent input supplies for each channel, over an input voltage range of 1.8V to 20V . \nEach output supplies up to 500mA of output current with a typical dropout voltage of 300mV\n. Quiescent current is \nwell controlled in dropout. With an external 10nF bypass capacitor , output noise is only 20µV\nRMS over a 10Hz to \n100kHz bandwidth. Designed for use in battery-powered systems, the low 55µA quiescent current per channel makes it an ideal choice. In shutdown, quiescent current drops to less than 1µA. Shutdown control is independent for each channel, allowing for flexible power management.\nThe L T3029 optimizes stability and transient response with \nlow ESR ceramic output capacitors, requiring a minimum of only 3.3µF . The regulator does not require the addition of ESR, as is common with other regulators. \nInternal circuitry provides reverse-battery protection, \nreverse-current protection, current limiting with foldback and thermal shutdown. The device is available as an adjustable output voltage device with a 1.215V reference voltage. The L T3029 is offered in the thermally enhanced 16-lead MSOP and 16-lead, low profile (4mm × 3mm × 0.75mm) DFN packages. \n2.5V IN to 1.5V/1.8V Applicationn Output Current: 500mA per Channel\nn Low Dropout Voltage: 300mV\nn Low Noise: 20µV RMS (10Hz to 100kHz) \nn Low Quiescent Current: 55µA per Channel\nn Wide Input Voltage Range: 1.8V to 20V (Common or Independent Input Supply)\nn Adjustable Output: 1.215V Reference Voltage\nn Very Low Quiescent Current in Shutdown: <1µA per Channel\nn Stable with 3.3µF Minimum Output Capacitor\nn Stable with Ceramic, Tantalum or Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors \nn Reverse-Battery and Reverse Output-to-Input Protection\nn Current Limit with Foldback and Thermal Shutdown\nn T racking/Sequencing Capability: Compatible with L\nTC292X Power Supply T racking ICs\nn Thermally Enhanced 16-Lead MSOP and 16-Lead (4mm ×\n 3mm) DFN Packages\nn General Purpose Linear Regulator\nn Battery-Powered Systems\nn Microprocessor Core/Logic Supplies\nn Post Regulator for Switching Supplies\nn T racking/Sequencing Power Supplies\nDropout Voltage vs Load Current\nVOUT1  \n1.8V\n500mA\nVOUT2  \n1.5V500mA237k1%10nF3.3µF 113k1%\n3029 TA01OUT2\nADJ2BYP2\nGND 237k1%10nF 3.3µF 54.9k1%OUT1\nADJ1BYP1LT3029IN1VIN\n2.5V\n3.3µF\nSHDN1IN2\nSHDN2\nOUTPUT CURRENT (mA)0DROPOUT VOL TAGE (mV)400\n350\n300250200150100\n50\n0\n400\n3029 TA01b100 200 300 500 50 450 150 250 350TJ = 25°CL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks and \nThinSOT is a trademark of Linear Technology Corporation.

more information www.linear .com/L T3029pin Func Tions\nBYP1/BYP2 (Pin 1/Pin 8): Bypass. Use the BYP1/BYP2 \npins to bypass the reference of the L T3029 regulator and achieve low output noise performance. Internal circuitry clamps the BYP1/BYP2 pins to ±0.6V (one V\nBE) from \nground. A small capacitor from the corresponding output to \nthis pin bypasses the reference to lower the output voltage noise. Using a maximum value of 10nF reduces the output voltage noise to a typical 20µV\nRMS over a 10Hz to 100kHz \nbandwidth. If not used, this pin must be left unconnected.\nNC (Pin 2): No Connect. This pin is not connected to  \nany internal circuitry. It may be floated, tied to V IN or tied \nto GND.OUT1/OUT2 (Pins 3, 4/Pins 6, 7): Output. The outputs \nsupply power to the loads. A minimum 3.3µF output ca -\npacitor prevents oscillations on each output. Applications with large output load transients require larger values of output capacitance to limit peak voltage transients. See the Applications \nInformation section for more on output \ncapacitance and reverse output characteristics.\nGND (Pin 5, 17): Ground. The exposed pad (Pin 17) of \nthe DFN and MSOP packages is an electrical connection to GND. To ensure proper electrical and thermal perfor -\nmance, solder Pin 17 to the PCB ground and tie directly to Pin 5. Connect the bottom of the output voltage setting resistor divider directly to GND (Pin 5) for optimum load regulation performance.\nIN1/IN2 (Pins 13, 14/Pins 11, 12):\n Inputs. The IN1/IN2 \npins supply power to each channel. The L T3029 requires a bypass capacitor at the IN1/IN2 pins if located more than six inches away from the main input filter capacitor . Include a bypass capacitor in battery-powered circuits, as a battery’s output impedance rises with frequency. A bypass capacitor in the range of 1µF to 10µF suffices. The \nL T3029’s design withstands reverse voltages on the IN pins \nwith respect to ground and the OUT pins. In the case of a reversed input, which occurs if a battery is plugged in backwards, the L T3029 acts as if a diode is in series with its input. No reverse current flows into the L T3029 and no reverse voltage appears at the load. The device protects itself and the load.\nSHDN1 /SHDN2 (Pin 15/Pin 10): Shutdown. Pulling the \nSHDN1 or SHDN2 pin low puts its corresponding L T3029 \nchannel into a low power state and turns its output off. The SHDN1 and SHDN2 pins are completely independent of each other , and each SHDN pin only affects operation on its corresponding channel. Drive the SHDN1 and SHDN2 \npins with either logic or an open collector/drain with pull-up resistors. The resistors supply the pull-up current to the open collectors/drains and the SHDN1 or SHDN2 current, \ntypically less than 1µA. If unused, connect the SHDN1 and SHDN2 to their corresponding IN pins. Each channel will be in its low power shutdown state if its corresponding SHDN pin is not connected. \nADJ1/ADJ2: (Pin 16/Pin 9) Adjust Pin. These are the error \namplifier inputs. These pins are internally clamped to ±9V . A typical input bias current of 30nA flows into the pins (see curve of ADJ1/ADJ2 Pin Bias Current vs Temperature in the Typical Performance Characteristics section). The ADJ1 and ADJ2 pin voltage is 1.215V referenced to ground and the output voltage range is 1.215V to 19.5V . \nLT302912\n3029fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3029The L T3029 is a dual 500mA/500mA low dropout regulator \nwith independent inputs, micropower quiescent current and shutdown. The device supplies up to 500mA from each channel’s output at a typical dropout voltage of 300mV . The two regulators share a common GND pin and are thermally coupled. However , the two inputs and outputs of the L T3029 operate independently. Each channel can be shut down independently, but a thermal shutdown fault on either channel shuts off the output on both channels. The addition of a 10nF reference bypass capacitor lowers output voltage noise to 20µV\nRMS over a 10Hz to 100kHz \nbandwidth. Additionally, the reference bypass capacitor improves transient response of the regulator , lowering the settling time for transient load conditions. The low operating quiescent current (55µA per channel) drops to less than 1µA in shutdown. In addition to the low quies -\ncent current, the L T3029 regulator incorporates several protection features that make it ideal for use in battery-\npowered systems. Most importantly\n, the device protects \nitself against reverse input voltages. Current limiting with foldback necessitates a minimum load current of 20µA for input/output voltage differentials of more than 10V to keep the output regulated. \nAdjustable Operation\nEach of the L T3029’s channels has an output voltage range \nof 1.215V to 19.5V . Figure 1 illustrates that output voltage is set by the ratio of two external resistors. The device regulates the output to maintain the corresponding ADJ pin voltage at 1.215V referenced to ground. R1’s current equals 1.215V/R1. R2’s current equals R1’s current plus the ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ pin bias current, 30nA at 25°C, flows through R2 into the ADJ pin. Use the formula in Figure 1 to calculate output voltage. Linear Technol -\nogy recommends that the value of R1 be less than 243k to minimize errors in the output voltage due to the ADJ pin bias current. In shutdown, the output turns off and the divider current is zero. Cur ves of ADJ Pin V\noltage vs \nTemperature and ADJ Pin Bias Current vs Temperature appear in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 1.

Linear Technology recommends a good \nquality low leakage capacitor\n. This capacitor bypasses the \nregulator’s reference, providing a low frequency noise pole. \nA 10nF bypass capacitor introduces a noise pole that de -\ncreases output voltage noise to as low as 20µV RMS. Using \na bypass capacitor provides the added benefit of improving transient response. With no bypass capacitor , and a 10µF output capacitor , a 100mA to 500mA load step settles to within 1% of its final value in approximately 100µs. With the addition of a 10nF bypass capacitor and evaluating the same load step, output voltage excursion stays within 1% (see T ransient Response in the Typical Performance Characteristics section). Using a bypass capacitor makes regulator start-up time proportional to the value of the bypass capacitor . For example, a 10nF bypass capacitor and 10µF output capacitor slow start-up time to 7ms.\nOutput Capacitance and T ransient Response\nThe L T3029 design is stable with a wide range of output \ncapacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor affects stabil -\nity, most notably with small capacitors. Linear Technology recommends a \nminimum output capacitor of 3.3µF with \nan ESR of 3Ω, or less, to prevent oscillations. The L T3029 is a micropower device, and output transient response is a function of output capacitance. Larger values of output capacitance decrease the peak deviations and provide im -\nproved transient response for larger load current changes. \nCeramic capacitors require extra consideration. Manufac-\nturers make ceramic capacitors with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across temperature and  \napplied voltage. The most common dielectrics specify the EIA temperature characteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V\n, \nX5R and X7R. Z5U and Y5V dielectrics provide high C-V products in a small package at low cost, but exhibit strong voltage and temperature coefficients, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. When used with a 5V regulator , a 16V 10µF Y5V capacitor can exhibit an effective value as low as 1µF to 2µF for the applied DC bias voltage and over the operat -\ning temperature range. X5R and X7R dielectrics result in more stable characteristics and are more suitable for use as the output capacitor . The X7R type has better stability \nacross temperature, while the X5R is less expensive and is available in higher values.\nDC BIAS VOLTAGE (V)CHANGE IN VALUE (%)\n3029 F0220\n0\n–20\n–40–60–80\n–100\n0 4 8 10 2 6 12 14X5R\nY5V\n16BOTH CAPACITORS ARE 16V,\n1210 CASE SIZE, 10µF  \nTEMPERATURE (°C)–5040\n20\n0\n–20–40–60–80\n–100\n25 75\n3029 F03–25 0 50 100 125Y5VCHANGE IN VALUE (%)X5R\nBOTH CAPACITORS ARE 16V,\n1210 CASE SIZE, 10µF  Figure 2.

Capacitance change due to DC bias (voltage coefficient) with X5R and X7R capacitors is better than with Y5V and Z5U capacitors, but can still be significant enough to drop capacitor values below appropriate levels. Capacitor DC bias characteristics tend to improve as case size increases. Linear Technology recommends verifying expected versus actual capacitance values at operating voltage in situ for an application.\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a piezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates voltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, similar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or micro -\nphone works. For a ceramic capacitor , the stress can be induced by \nvibrations in the system or thermal transients. \nThe resulting voltages produced can cause appreciable amounts of noise, especially when a ceramic capacitor is used for noise bypassing. A ceramic capacitor produced Figure 4’s trace in response to light tapping from a pencil. Similar vibration induced behavior can masquerade as increased output voltage noise.\nFigure 4.

Two components comprise the power dissipated by each channel:\n1. Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage \ndifferential: (I\nOUT)(VIN – V OUT), and\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage: (I GND)\n(VIN).\nGround pin current is found by examining the GND Pin Current curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section. \nPower dissipation for each channel equals the sum of the \ntwo components listed above. Total power dissipation for the L T3029 equals the sum of the power dissipated by each channel.\nThe L T3029’s internal thermal shutdown circuitry protects \nboth channels of the device if either channel experiences an overload or fault condition. Activation of the thermal shutdown circuitry turns both channels off. If the overload  or fault condition is removed, both outputs are allowed to turn back on. For continuous normal conditions, do not exceed the maximum junction temperature rating of  (125°C, L T3029E/L T3029I/L T3029MP or 150°C, L T3029H). Carefully consider all sources of thermal resistance from junction-to-ambient, including additional heat sources mounted in proximity to the L T3029. For surface mount devices, use the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board and its copper traces to accomplish heat sinking. Copper \nboard stiffeners and plated through-holes can also spread the heat generated by power devices.\nThe following tables list thermal resistance as a function \nof copper area in a fixed board size. All measurements were taken in still air on a four-layer FR-4 board with 1oz solid internal planes, and 2oz external trace planes with a total board thickness of 1.6mm.

Chan -\nnel 2’s output voltage is set to 1.5V . Each channel’s input \nvoltage is 2.5V . Each channel’\ns output current range is \n0mA to 500mA. The application has a maximum ambient temperature of 50°C. What is the L T3029’s maximum junction temperature?\nThe power dissipated by each channel equals:\n IOUT(MAX) (VIN – V OUT) + I GND(VIN)\nwhere for each output:I\nOUT(MAX)  = 500mA\nVIN = 2.5V\nIGND at (I OUT = 500mA, V IN = 2.5V) = 8.5mA\nSo, for output 1:P = 500mA (2.5V – 1.8V) + 8.5mA (2.5V) = 0.37WFor output 2:P = 500mA (2.5V – 1.5V) + 8.5mA (2.5V) = 0.52WThe thermal resistance is in the range of 35°C/W to 40°C/W , \ndepending on the copper area. So, the junction temperature rise above ambient temperature approximately equals:\n (0.37W + 0.52W) 39°C/W = 34.7°C\nThe maximum junction temperature then equals the maxi -\nmum ambient temperature plus the maximum junction temperature rise above ambient temperature, or:\n TJMAX = 50°C + 34.7°C = 84.7°C\nProtection Features\nThe L T3029 regulator incorporates several protection fea -\ntures that make it ideal for use in battery-powered circuits. \nIn addition to the normal protection features associated with monolithic regulators, such as current limiting and thermal limiting, the device protects itself against reverse input voltages and reverse voltages from output to input. The two regulators have independent inputs, a common GND pin and are thermally coupled. However , \nthe two \nchannels of the L T3029 operate independently. Each channel’s output can be shut down independently, and a fault condition on one output does not affect the other output electrically, unless the thermal shutdown circuitry is activated.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nprotect the device against current overload conditions at each output of the L T3029. For normal operation, do not \nallow the junction temperature to exceed 125°C (L T3029E/L T3029I/L T3029MP) or 150°C (L T3029H). The typical \nthermal shutdown temperature threshold is 165°C and the circuitry incorporates approximately 5°C of hysteresis. \nEach channel’s input withstands reverse voltages of 22V . \nCurrent flow into the device is limited to less than 1mA (typically less than 100µA) and no negative voltage appears at the respective channel’s output. The device protects both itself and the load against batteries that are plugged in backwards.\nThe L T3029 incurs no damage if either channel’s output \nis pulled below ground. If the input is left open-circuit, or grounded, the output can be pulled below ground by 22V . The output acts like an open circuit, and no current flows from the output. However , current flows in (but is limited by) the external resistor divider that sets the output voltage.\nLT302916\n3029fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3029applica Tions inForMaTion\nThe L T3029 incurs no damage if either ADJ pin is pulled \nabove or below ground by 9V . If the input is left open circuit or grounded, the ADJ pins perform like an open circuit down to –1.5V , and then like a 1.2k resistor down to –9V when pulled below ground. When pulled above ground, the ADJ pins perform like an open circuit up to 0.5V , then like a 5.7k resistor up to 3V , then like a 1.8k resistor up to 9V . \nIn situations where an ADJ pin connects to a resistor \ndivider that would pull the pin above its 9V clamp volt -\nage if the output is pulled high, the ADJ pin input current must be limited to less than 5mA. For example, assume a \nresistor divider sets the regulated output voltage to \n1.5V , and the output is forced to 20V . The top resistor of the resistor divider must be chosen to limit the current into the ADJ pin to less than 5mA when the ADJ pin is at 9V . The 11V difference between the OUT and ADJ pins divided by the 5mA maximum current into the ADJ pin yields a minimum top resistor value of 2.2k.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several \ndifferent input/output conditions can occur . The output voltage may be held up while the input is either pulled to ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage or is left open-circuit. Current flow back into the output follows the curve shown in Figure 5.If either of the L T3029’s IN pins is forced below its cor -\nresponding OUT pin, or the OUT pin is pulled above its corresponding IN pin, input current for that channel typi -\ncally drops to less than 2µA. This occurs if the IN pin is connected to a discharged (low voltage) batter\ny, and either \na backup battery or a second regulator circuit holds up the output. The state of that channel’s SHDN pin has no effect on the reverse output current if the output is pulled above the input.\nOverload Recovery\nLike many IC power regulators, the L T3029 has safe \noperating area (SOA) protection. The safe area protec -\ntion decreases current limit as input-to-output voltage increases and keeps the power transistor inside a safe operating region for all values of input-to-output voltage. The protective design provides some output current at all values of input-to-output voltage up to the specified maximum operational input voltage of 20V . \nWhen power is first applied, as input voltage rises, the \noutput follows the input, allowing the regulator to start-up into \nvery heavy loads. During start-up, as the input voltage \nis rising, the input-to-output voltage differential is small, allowing the regulator to supply large output currents. With a high input voltage, an event can occur wherein removal of an output short will not allow the output to recover . The event occurs with a heavy output load when the input voltage is high and the output voltage is low. Common situations occur immediately after the removal of a short-circuit or if the shutdown pin is pulled high after the input voltage has already been turned on. The load line intersects the output current curve at two points creating two stable output operating points for the regulator . With this double intersection, the input power supply may need to be cycled down to zero and brought up again to make the output recover .\nFigure 5.
