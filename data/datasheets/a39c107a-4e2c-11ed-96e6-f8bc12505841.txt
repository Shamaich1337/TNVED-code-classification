This high-voltage regulator contains \n100-V N-channel buck and synchronous rectifier switches and is available in 8-pin thermally-enhanced WSON \nand SO packages with pin pitches of 0.8 mm and 1.27 mm, respectively. The regulator operation is based on \nan adaptive constant on-time control architecture where the on-time is inversely proportional to input voltage \nVIN. This feature maintains a relatively constant operating frequency with load and input voltage variations. A \nconstant on-time switching regulator requires no loop compensation resulting in fast load transient response.\nThe LM5017 can be applied in numerous end equipment systems requiring efficient step-down regulation from \nhigher input voltages. This regulator is well-suited for 24-V industrial systems as well as 48-V communications \nand PoE voltage ranges. The LM5017 integrates an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit to prevent faulty \noperation of the device at low input voltages and features intelligent current limit and thermal shutdown to protect \nthe device during overload or short circuit. Peak current limit detection circuit is implemented with a forced \noff-time during current limiting that is inversely proportional to V OUT and directly proportional to V IN. Varying \nthe current limit off-time with V OUT and V IN ensures short-circuit protection with minimal current limit foldback. \nAdditional protection features include thermal shutdown with automatic recovery, VCC and gate drive UVLO, \nminimum forced off-time, and remote shutdown.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nFBVIN VCC\nSWBST\n1.62V\nVILIMLM5017\nRON\nCURRENT LIMIT \nCOMPARATOR\n+\n-VCC UVLO\nON/OFF \nTIMERS\nCOT \nCONTROL \nLOGIC1.225V VCC \nREGULATOR\nVIN\nFEEDBACK \nCOMPARATORDISABLETHERMAL\nSHUTDOWNUVLO\nSHUTDOWNBIAS \nREGULATOR\n0.66V20µA\nVCC\nCURRENT \nLIMIT TIMERRTNVINVIN\nRESR\nCOUTVOUTVOUTCIN\nRON\nLCBSTCVCCRUV2\nRUV1\nRFB2\nRFB11.225V\nOVERVOLTAGE \nCOMPARATORwww.ti.comLM5017\nSNVS783K – JANUARY 2012 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: LM5017\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Control Overview\nThe LM5017 buck regulator employs a control principle based on a comparator and a one-shot on-timer, with \nthe output voltage feedback (FB) compared to an internal reference (1.225 V). If the FB voltage is below the \nreference the internal buck switch is turned on for the one-shot timer period, which is a function of the input \nvoltage and the programming resistor (R ON). Following the on-time the switch remains off until the FB voltage \nfalls below the reference, but never before the minimum off-time forced by the minimum off-time one-shot timer. \nWhen the FB pin voltage falls below the reference and the minimum off-time one-shot period expires, the buck \nswitch is turned on for another on-time one-shot period. This will continue until regulation is achieved and the FB \nvoltage is approximately equal to 1.225 V (typ).\nIn a synchronous buck converter, the low-side (sync) FET is on when the high-side (buck) FET is off. The \ninductor current ramps up when the high-side switch is on and ramps down when the high-side switch is ‘off’. \nThere is no diode emulation feature in this IC, and therefore, the inductor current may ramp in the negative \ndirection at light load. This causes the converter to operate in continuous conduction mode (CCM) regardless of \nthe output loading. The operating frequency remains relatively constant with load and line variations. Calculate \nthe operating frequency as shown in Equation 1 .\nVOUTgSW =K x R ON\n(1)\nwhere\n•K = 9 x 10–11\nThe output voltage (V OUT) is set by two external resistors (R FB1, R FB2). The regulated output voltage is \ncalculated as shown in Equation 2 .\nRFB2 + R FB1VOUT = 1.225V xRFB1\n(2)\nThis regulator regulates the output voltage based on ripple voltage at the feedback input, requiring a minimum \namount of ESR for the output capacitor (C OUT). A minimum of 25 mV of ripple voltage at the feedback pin (FB) \nis required for the LM5017. In cases where the capacitor ESR is too small, additional series resistance may be \nrequired (R C in Figure 7-1 ).\nFor applications where lower output voltage ripple is required the output can be taken directly from a low ESR \noutput capacitor, as shown in Figure 7-1 . However, R C slightly degrades the load regulation.\nFBSWL1\nCOUTRFB2VOUT\nRC LM5017\n+\nRFB1VOUT \n(low ripple)\nFigure 7-1. Low Ripple Output Configuration\n7.3.2 VCC Regulator\nThe LM5017 device contains an internal high-voltage linear regulator with a nominal output of 7.6 V. The input \npin (V IN) can be connected directly to the line voltages up to 100 V. The V CC regulator is internally current limited \nto 30 mA. The regulator sources current into the external capacitor at V CC. This regulator supplies current to \ninternal circuit blocks including the synchronous MOSFET driver and the logic circuits. When the voltage on the \nVCC pin reaches the undervoltage lockout (V CC UVLO) threshold of 4.5 V, the IC is enabled.\nAn internal diode connected from V CC to the BST pin replenishes the charge in the gate drive bootstrap \ncapacitor when SW pin is low.LM5017\nSNVS783K – JANUARY 2012 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5017\nAt high input voltages, the power dissipated in the high voltage regulator is significant and can limit the overall \nachievable output power. As an example, with the input at 48 V and switching at high frequency, the V CC \nregulator may supply up to 7 mA of current resulting in 48 V × 7 mA = 336 mW of power dissipation.  If the V CC \nvoltage is driven externally by an alternate voltage source between 8.55 V and 13 V, the internal regulator is \ndisabled. This reduces the power dissipation in the IC.\n7.3.3 Regulation Comparator\nThe feedback voltage at FB is compared to an internal 1.225 V reference. In normal operation, when the output \nvoltage is in regulation, an on-time period is initiated when the voltage at FB falls below 1.225 V. The high side \nswitch will stay on for the on-time, causing the FB voltage to rise above 1.225 V. After the on-time period, the \nhigh side switch will stay off until the FB voltage again falls below 1.225 V. During start-up, the FB voltage will be \nbelow 1.225 V at the end of each on-time, causing the high side switch to turn on immediately after the minimum \nforced off-time of 144 ns. The high side switch can be turned off before the on-time is over if the peak current in \nthe inductor reaches the current limit threshold.\n7.3.4 Overvoltage Comparator\nThe feedback voltage at FB is compared to an internal 1.62 V reference. If the voltage at FB rises above 1.62 V \nthe on-time pulse is immediately terminated. This condition can occur if the input voltage and/or the output load \nchanges suddenly. The high side switch will not turn on again until the voltage at FB falls below 1.225 V.\n7.3.5 On-Time Generator\nThe on-time for the LM5017 device is determined by the R ON resistor and is inversely proportional to the input \nvoltage (V IN), resulting in a nearly constant frequency as V IN is varied over the operating range. The on-time for \nthe LM5017 can be calculated using Equation 3 .\n10-10 x R ONTON =VIN\n(3)\nSee Figure 6-5 . RON should be selected for a minimum on-time (at maximum V IN) greater than 100 ns for proper \noperation. This requirement limits the maximum switching frequency for high V IN.\n7.3.6 Current Limit\nThe LM5017 device contains an intelligent current limit off-timer. If the current in the buck switch exceeds 1.02 A, \nthe present cycle is immediately terminated, and a non-resetable off-timer is initiated. The length of the off-time \nis controlled by the FB voltage and the input voltage V IN. As an example, when FB = 0 V and V IN = 48 V, the \noff-time is set to 16 μs. This condition occurs when the output is shorted and during the initial part of start-up. \nThis V IN dependent off-time ensures safe short circuit operation up to the maximum input voltage of 100 V.\nIn cases of overload where the FB voltage is above zero volts (not a short circuit) the current limit off-time is \nreduced. Reducing the off-time during less severe overloads reduces the amount of foldback, recovery time, and \nstart-up time. The off-time is calculated from Equation 4 .\n0.07 x V INTOFF(ILIM)  =VFB + 0.2 VPs\n(4)\nThe current limit protection feature is peak limited. The maximum average output current will be less than the \npeak.\n7.3.7 N-Channel Buck Switch and Driver\nThe LM5017 device integrates an N-Channel Buck switch and associated floating high voltage gate driver. The \ngate driver circuit works in conjunction with an external bootstrap capacitor and an internal high voltage diode. \nA 0.01 uF ceramic capacitor connected between the BST pin and the SW pin provides the voltage to the driver \nduring the on-time. During each off-time, the SW pin is at approximately 0 V, and the bootstrap capacitor charges \nfrom V CC through the internal diode. The minimum off-timer, set to 144 ns, ensures a minimum time each cycle \nto recharge the bootstrap capacitor.www.ti.comLM5017\nSNVS783K – JANUARY 2012 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: LM5017\n7.3.8 Synchronous Rectifier\nThe LM5017 provides an internal synchronous N-Channel MOSFET rectifier. This MOSFET provides a path for \nthe inductor current to flow when the high-side MOSFET is turned off.\nThe synchronous rectifier has no diode emulation mode, and is designed to keep the regulator in continuous \nconduction mode even with light loads which would otherwise result in discontinuous operation.\n7.3.9 Undervoltage Detector\nThe LM5017 device contains a dual level undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit. A summary of threshold voltages \nand operational states is provided in Section 7.4. When the UVLO pin voltage is below 0.66 V, the regulator \nis in a low current shutdown mode. When the UVLO pin voltage is greater than 0.66V but less than 1.225 V, \nthe regulator is in standby mode. In standby mode the V CC bias regulator is active while the regulator output is \ndisabled. When the V CC pin exceeds the V CC undervoltage threshold and the UVLO pin voltage is greater than \n1.225 V, normal operation begins. An external set-point voltage divider from V IN to GND can be used to set the \nminimum operating voltage of the regulator.\nUVLO hysteresis is accomplished with an internal 20- μA current source that is switched on or off into the \nimpedance of the set-point divider. When the UVLO threshold is exceeded, the current source is activated to \nquickly raise the voltage at the UVLO pin. The hysteresis is equal to the value of this current times the resistance \nRUV2.\nIf the UVLO pin is connected directly to the V IN pin, the regulator will begin operation once the V CC undervoltage \nis satisfied.\n+VIN\nUVLOVIN\nRUV1CIN RUV22\n3LM5017\nFigure 7-2. UVLO Resistor Setting\n7.3.10 Thermal Protection\nThe LM5017 device should be operated so the junction temperature does not exceed 150°C during normal \noperation. An internal Thermal Shutdown circuit is provided to protect the LM5017 in the event of a higher \nthan normal junction temperature. When activated, typically at 165°C, the regulator is forced into a low power \nreset state, disabling the buck switch and the V CC regulator. This feature prevents catastrophic failures from \naccidental device overheating. When the junction temperature falls below 145°C (typical hysteresis = 20°C), the \nVCC regulator is enabled, and normal operation is resumed.\n7.3.11 Ripple Configuration\nLM5017 uses Constant-On-Time (COT) control in which the on-time is terminated by an on-timer and the off-time \nis terminated by the feedback voltage (V FB) falling below the reference voltage (V REF). Therefore, for stable \noperation, the feedback voltage must decrease monotonically, in phase with the inductor current during the \noff-time. Furthermore, this change in feedback voltage (V FB) during off-time must be larger than any noise \ncomponent present at the feedback node.\nTable 7-1  shows three different methods for generating appropriate voltage ripple at the feedback node. Type 1 \nand Type 2 ripple circuits couple the ripple at the output of the converter to the feedback node (FB). The output \nvoltage ripple has two components:\n1.Capacitive ripple caused by the inductor current ripple charging/discharging the output capacitor.\n2.Resistive ripple caused by the inductor current ripple flowing through the ESR of the output capacitor.\nThe capacitive ripple is not in phase with the inductor current. As a result, the capacitive ripple does not \ndecrease monotonically during the off-time. The resistive ripple is in phase with the inductor current and LM5017\nSNVS783K – JANUARY 2012 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5017\ndecreases monotonically during the off-time. The resistive ripple must exceed the capacitive ripple at the output \nnode (V OUT) for stable operation. If this condition is not satisfied unstable switching behavior is observed in COT \nconverters, with multiple on-time bursts in close succession followed by a long off-time.\nType 3 ripple method uses R r and C r and the switch node (SW) voltage to generate a triangular ramp. \nThis triangular ramp is ac coupled using C ac to the feedback node (FB). Since this circuit does not use the \noutput voltage ripple, it is ideally suited for applications where low output voltage ripple is required. For more \ninformation on each ripple generation method, refer to the AN-1481 Controlling Output Ripple and Achieving \nESR Independence in Constant On-Time (COT) Regulator Designs  application report .\nTable 7-1.

As shown in Figure 7-3 , \nthe soft-start circuit consists of one capacitor, C 1, two resistors, R 1 and R 2, and a diode, D. During the initial \nstart-up, the VCC voltage is established prior to the V OUT voltage. Capacitor C 1 is discharged and D is thereby \nforward biased to pull up the FB voltage. The FB voltage exceeds the reference voltage (1.225 V) and switching \nis therefore disabled. As capacitor C 1 charges, the voltage at node B gradually decreases and switching \ncommences. V OUT will gradually rise to maintain the FB voltage at the reference voltage. Once the voltage at \nnode B is less than a diode drop above FB voltage, the soft-start is finished and D is reverse biased.\nDuring the initial part of the start-up, the FB voltage can be approximated as follows. Please note that the effect \nof R 1 has been ignored to simplify the calculation shown in Equation 8 .\nRFB1 x R FB2\nR2 x (R FB1 + R FB2) + R FB1 x R FB2 VFB = (VCC - V D) x\n(8)\nC1 is charged after the first start up. Diode D1 is optional and can be added to discharge C1 when the input \nvoltage experiences a momentary drop to initialize the soft-start sequence.www.ti.comLM5017\nSNVS783K – JANUARY 2012 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: LM5017\nTo achieve the desired soft-start, the following design guidance is recommended:\n(1) R 2 is selected so that V FB is higher than 1.225 V for a V CC of 4.5 V, but is lower than 5 V when V CC is 8.55 V. \nIf an external V CC is used, V FB should not exceed 5 V at maximum V CC.\n(2) C 1 is selected to achieve the desired start-up time that can be determined from Equation 9 .\nRFB1 x R FB2\nRFB1 + R FB2 tS = C 1 x (R 2 + )\n(9)\n(3) R 1 is used to maintain the node B voltage at zero after the soft-start is finished. A value larger than the \nfeedback resistor divider is preferred. Note that the effect of R 1 is ignored in the previous equations.\nBased on the schematic shown in Figure 8-1 , selecting C 1 = 1 uF, R 2 = 1 k Ω, R1 = 30 k Ω results in a soft-start \ntime of about 2 ms.\nVOUT\nRFB2VCC\nRFB1To FB DC1\nR2\nR1D1\nB\nFigure 7-3.

Standard \nvalues are chosen with R FB2 = R1 = 6.98 k Ω and R FB1 = R6 = 1 k Ω. Other values could be used as long as the \n7 : 1 ratio is maintained.\n8.2.1.2.3 Frequency Selection\nAt the minimum input voltage, the maximum switching frequency of LM5017 is restricted by the forced minimum \noff-time (T OFF(MIN) ) as given by Equation 10 .\n1 - D MAXgSW(MAX)  =TOFF(MIN)1 - 10/12.5\n200 ns= = 1 MHz\n(10)\nSimilarly, at maximum input voltage, the maximum switching frequency of LM5017 is restricted by the minimum \nTON as given by Equation 11 .\nDMINgSW(MAX)  =TON(MIN)10/95\n100 ns= = 1.05 MHz\n(11)\nResistor R ON sets the nominal switching frequency based on Equation 12 .\nVOUTgSW =K x R ON\n(12)\nwhere\n•K = 9 x 10–11\nOperation at high switching frequency results in lower efficiency while providing the smallest solution. For this \nexample a conservative 225 kHz was selected, resulting in R ON = 493 k Ω. A standard value for R ON = R3 = 499 \nkΩ is selected.\n8.2.1.2.4 Inductor Selection\nThe minimum inductance is selected to limit the output ripple to 15 to 40 percent of the maximum load current.

Substituting V IN = 95 V and ΔIL = 40 percent \n× IOUT (max)  results in L1 = 198 μH. The next higher standard value of 220 μH is chosen. The peak-to-peak \nminimum and maximum inductor current ripple are 40 mA and 181 mA at the minimum and maximum input \nvoltages respectively. The peak inductor and switch current is given by Equation 14 .LM5017\nSNVS783K – JANUARY 2012 – REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5017\nûIL(MAX)ILI(peak) = I OUT +2= 690 mA(14)\n690 mA is less than the minimum current limit threshold of 0.7 A. The selected inductor should be able to \nwithstand the maximum current limit of 1.3 A during startup and overload conditions without saturating.\n8.2.1.2.5 Output Capacitor\nThe output capacitor is selected to minimize the capacitive ripple across it. The maximum ripple is observed at \nmaximum input voltage and is given by:\nûILCOUT =8 x gsw x ûVripple \n(15)\nwhere\n•ΔVripple is the voltage ripple across the capacitor.\nAssuming V IN = 95 V and substituting ΔVripple = 10 mV gives C OUT = 10.1 μF. A 22-μ F standard value is selected \nfor C OUT = C9. An X5R or X7R type capacitor with a voltage rating 16 V or higher should be selected.\n8.2.1.2.6 Type III Ripple Circuit\nType III ripple circuit as described in Section 7.3.11  is chosen for this example. For a constant on-time converter \nto be stable, the injected in-phase ripple should be larger than the capacitive ripple on C OUT.\nUsing the type III ripple circuit equation, the target ripple will be greater than the capacitive ripple generated at \nthe primary-side output if the following condition is satisfied:\nCr = C6 = 3300 pF\nCac = C8 = 100 nF\nIN(MIN) OUT ON(VINMIN)\nr\nr(V V ) T\nR(25 mV C )\x10 u \ndu\n(16)\nFor T ON, refer to Equation 3 .\nRipple resistor R r is calculated to be 57.6 k Ω. This value provides the minimum ripple for stable operation. A \nsmaller resistance should be selected to allow for variations in T ON, COUT, and other components. R r = R4 = 46.4 \nkΩ is selected for this example application.\n8.2.1.2.7 VCC and Bootstrap Capacitors\nThe V CC capacitor provides charge to bootstrap capacitor as well as internal circuitry and low side gate driver. \nThe Bootstrap capacitor provides charge to high side gate driver. The recommended value for C VCC = C7 = 1 μF. \nA good value for C BST = C1 = 0.01 μF.\n8.2.1.2.8 Input Capacitor\nInput capacitor should be large enough to limit the input voltage ripple as shown in Equation 17 .\nIOUT(MAX)CIN4 x gSW x ûVIN >\n(17)\nChoosing a ΔVIN = 0.5 V gives a minimum C IN = 1.3 μF. A standard value of 2.2 μF is selected for C IN = C4. \nThe input capacitor should be rated for the maximum input voltage under all conditions. A 100-V, X7R dielectric \nshould be selected for this design.\nThe input capacitor should be placed directly across V IN and RTN (pin 1 and 2) of the IC. If it is not possible to \nplace all of the input capacitor close to the IC, a 0.47- μF capacitor should be placed near the IC to provide a \nbypass path for the high frequency component of the switching current.www.ti.comLM5017\nSNVS783K – JANUARY 2012 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: LM5017\n8.2.1.2.9 UVLO Resistors\nThe UVLO resistors R FB1 and R FB2 set the UVLO threshold and hysteresis according to the relationship shown \nin Equation 18  and Equation 19 .\nVIN(HYS) =IHYS x RUV2\n(18)\nwhere\n•IHYS = 20 μA\nRUV2VIN (UVLO,rising) = 1.225 V xRUV1+ 1 ( )\n(19)\nSetting UVLO hysteresis of 2.5 V and UVLO rising threshold of 12 V results in R UV1 = 14.53 kΩ and\nRUV2 = 125 k Ω.

Therefore, N2 / N1 = 1.\nIf the secondary (isolated) output voltage is significantly higher or lower than the primary output voltage, a turns \nratio less than or greater than 1 is recommended. The primary output voltage is normally selected based on the \ninput voltage range such that the duty cycle of the converter does not exceed 50% at the minimum input voltage. \nThis condition is satisfied if VOUT1 < V IN_MIN  / 2.\n8.2.2.2.2 Total I OUT\nCalculate the total primary-referred load current by multiplying the isolated output loads by the turns ratio of the \ntransformer as shown in Equation 21 .\nOUT(MAX) OUT1 OUT2N2I I I 0.3 AN1 \x0e u  \n(21)\n8.2.2.2.3 RFB1, RFB2\nThe feedback resistors are selected to set the primary output voltage.

V OUT1 must be set to \na voltage at least one diode drop higher than 8.55 V (the maximum V CC voltage) if D2 is used to supply bias \ncurrent.\n8.2.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 8-9.

The \ncharacteristics of the input supply must be compatible with the Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 tables. In addition, \nthe input supply must be capable of delivering the required input current to the fully-loaded regulator. Estimate \nthe average input current with Equation 35 .\nOUT\nIN\nINPIVK \x98\n(35)\nwhere\n•η is the efficiency\nIf the regulator is connected to an input supply through long wires or PCB traces with a large impedance, take \nspecial care to achieve stable performance. The parasitic inductance and resistance of the input cables may \nhave an adverse affect on converter operation, particularly during operation at low input voltage. The parasitic \ninductance in combination with the low-ESR ceramic input capacitors form an underdamped resonant circuit. \nThis circuit can cause overvoltage transients at VIN each time the input supply is cycled on and off. The parasitic \nresistance causes the input voltage to dip during a load transient. The best way to solve such issues is to reduce \nthe distance from the input supply to the regulator and use an aluminum or tantalum input capacitor in parallel \nwith the ceramics. The moderate ESR of the electrolytic capacitors helps to damp the input resonant circuit and \nreduce any voltage overshoots. A capacitance in the range of 4.7 µF to 22 µF is usually sufficient to provide \ninput parallel damping and helps to hold the input voltage steady during large load transients.\nAn EMI input filter is often used in front of the regulator that, unless carefully designed, can lead to instability \nas well as some of the effects mentioned above. The application report Simple Success with Conducted EMI \nfor DC-DC Converters  (SNVA489) provides helpful suggestions when designing an input filter for any switching \nregulator.www.ti.comLM5017\nSNVS783K – JANUARY 2012 – REVISED AUGUST 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: LM5017\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nA proper layout is essential for optimum performance of the circuit. In particular, the following guidelines should \nbe observed:\n1.CIN: The loop consisting of input capacitor (C IN), VIN pin, and RTN pin carries switching currents. Therefore, \nthe input capacitor should be placed close to the IC, directly across V IN and RTN pins and the connections to \nthese two pins should be direct to minimize the loop area. In general it is not possible to accommodate all of \ninput capacitance near the IC. A good practice is to use a 0.1-μF or 0.47-μF capacitor directly across the V IN \nand RTN pins close to the IC, and the remaining bulk capacitor as close as possible (see Figure 10-1 ).\n2.CVCC and C BST: The V CC and bootstrap (BST) bypass capacitors supply switching currents to the high and \nlow side gate drivers. These two capacitors should also be placed as close to the IC as possible, and the \nconnecting trace length and loop area should be minimized (see Figure 10-1 ).\n3.The Feedback trace carries the output voltage information and a small ripple component that is necessary \nfor proper operation of LM5017. Therefore, care should be taken while routing the feedback trace to avoid \ncoupling any noise to this pin. In particular, feedback trace should not run close to magnetic components, or \nparallel to any other switching trace.\n4.SW trace: The SW node switches rapidly between V IN and GND every cycle and is therefore a possible \nsource of noise. The SW node area should be minimized. In particular, the SW node should not be \ninadvertently connected to a copper plane or pour.\n10.2 Layout Example\nUVLO 3\nRON 4RTN 1\nVIN 28   SW\n7   BST\n6   VCC\n5   FBSO \nPowerPAD-\n8CIN\nCVCC\nFigure 10-1.
