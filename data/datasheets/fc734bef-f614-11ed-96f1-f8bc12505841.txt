They achieve a20ns propagation delay while consuming only 225µAsupply current per comparator. The MAX998 features alow-power shutdown mode that places the output in ahigh-impedance state and reduces supply current to 1nA.\nThe MAX976/MAX978/MAX998 inputs have a common-\nmode voltage range that extends 200mV below ground.Their outputs are capable of rail-to-rail operation with-out external pullup circuitry, making these devices idealfor interface with CMOS/TTL logic. All inputs and out-puts can tolerate a continuous short-circuit fault condi-tion to either rail. The comparators’ internal hysteresisensures clean output switching, even with slow-movinginput signals.\nFor space-critical applications, the single MAX998 is\navailable in a 6-pin SOT23 package, the dual MAX976is available in an 8-pin µMAX\n®package, and the quad\nMAX978 is available in a 16-pin QSOP package.\n________________________Applications\nBattery-Powered Systems\nThreshold Detectors/Discriminators3V SystemsIR ReceiversDigital Line Receivers____________________________Features\noSingle-Supply Operation Down to 2.7V\no20ns Propagation Delay\no225µA Supply Current\no1nA Shutdown Supply Current\noRail-to-Rail Outputs\noGround-Sensing Inputs\noInternal Hysteresis Ensures Clean Switching\noAvailable in Space-Saving Packages\nSOT23 (MAX998)µMAX (MAX976)\nQSOP (MAX978)\nTOP VIEW\nGND\nIN- IN+16 V CC\n5 SHDNOUTMAX998\nSOT232\n34+-+PART PIN-PACKAGESOT23\nTOP MARK\nMAX976 ESA+ 8 SO —\nMAX976EUA+ 8 µMAX —\nMAX978 ESE+ 16 Narrrow SO —\nMAX978EEE+ 16 QSOP —\nMAX998 ESA+ 8 SO —\nMAX998EUT+T 6 SOT23 AAAO\n__________________Pin Configurations\nVCC\nVCCVCC\nVCCRD\nSHDN\nR1 R2\nIR RECEIVEROUT0.1µF\nMAX998VCC\nGND___________Typical Operating Circuit_______________Ordering Information\nPin Configurations continued at end of data sheet\nµMAX a registered trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.Note: All devices are specified over the -40°C to +85°C tem-\nperature range.\n+ Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.\nMAX976/MAX978/MAX998\nSingle/Dual/Quad, SOT23, Single-Supply, \nHigh-Speed, Low-Power Comparators\n2 Maxim IntegratedmVABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\n(VCC= +2.7V to +5.5V, V CM= 0V, T A= -40°C to +85°C, unless otherwise noted.

This tends to occur when the voltage onone input is equal to or very close to the voltage on theother input. The MAX976/MAX978/MAX998 have inter-nal hysteresis to counter parasitic effects and noise.The hysteresis in a comparator creates two trip points:one for the rising input voltage and one for the fallinginput voltage (Figure 1). The difference between the trippoints is the hysteresis. When the comparator inputvoltages are equal, the hysteresis effectively causesone comparator input voltage to move quickly past theother, taking the input out of the region where oscilla-tion occurs.\nFigure 1 illustrates the case where IN- has a fixed volt-\nage applied and IN+ is varied. If the inputs werereversed, the figure would be the same, except with aninverted output.\nInput-Stage Circuitry\nThe MAX976/MAX978/MAX998 input common-modevoltage range is from -0.2V to (V\nCC- 1.2V). The voltage\nrange for each comparator input extends to both V CC\nand GND. The output remains in the correct logic statewhile one or both of the inputs are within the common-mode range. If both input levels are out of the common-mode range, input-stage current saturation occurs, andthe output becomes unpredictable.\nShutdown Mode\nThe MAX998 features a low-power shutdown mode,which is activated by forcing SHDN low. Shutdown\nmode reduces the supply current to 1nA (typical), dis-ables the comparator, and places the output in a high-impedance state. Drive SHDN high to enable the\ncomparator. Do not leave SHDN unconnected. Since it\nis a high-impedance input, leaving SHDN unconnected\ncould result in indeterminate logic levels, adverselyaffecting comparator operation. Likewise, do not three-\nstate SHDN . Due to the output leakage currents of\nthree-state devices and the small internal current forSHDN , three-stating this pin could also result in indeter-\nminate logic levels.\nThe maximum input voltage for SHDN is 6V, referred to\nGND, and is not limited by V\nCC. This allows the use of\n5V logic to drive SHDN while V CCoperates at a lower\nvoltage, such as 3V. The logic threshold limits forSHDN are proportional to V\nCC(see Electrical\nCharacteristics ).\n_____________ Applications Information\nCircuit Layout and Bypassing\nThe MAX976/MAX978/MAX998 have a high-gain band-\nwidth and require careful board layout. We recommendthe following design guidelines:\n1) Use a printed circuit board with an unbroken, low-\ninductance ground plane. Surface-mount compo-nents are recommended.\n2) Place a decoupling capacitor (a 0.1µF ceramic\ncapacitor is a good choice) between V\nCCand\nground as close to the pins as possible.\n3) Keep lead lengths short on the inputs and outputs\nto avoid unwanted parasitic feedback around thecomparators.\n4) Solder the devices directly to the printed circuit\nboard instead of using a socket.\n5) Minimize input impedance.6) For slowly varying inputs, use a small capacitor\n(~1000pF) across the inputs to improve stability.\nAdditional Hysteresis\nGenerate additional hysteresis with three resistorsusing positive feedback, as shown in Figure 2. Thispositive feedback method slows the hysteresisresponse time. Calculate resistor values as follows:\n1) Select R3. The leakage current of IN+ is typically\n75nA, so the current through R3 should be at least\n1.0µA to minimize errors caused by leakage current.The current through R3 at the trip point is (V\nREF-\nVOUT) / R3. Consider the two possible output states\nwhen solving for R3. The two formulas are:\nR3 = V REF/1.0µA \nor \nR3 = (V CC- VREF)/1.0µA\nUse the smaller of the two resulting resistor values.\nFor example, if V REF= 1.2V and V CC= 5.0V, the two\nresistor values are 1.2M Ωand 3.8M Ω. Choose a\nstandard value for R3 of 1.2M Ω.VOLVOHVIN- = 0VOS =VTRIP+ + VTRIP-\n2\nCOMPARATOR\nOUTPUTVTRIP+\nVIN+VHYST\nVTRIP-\nFigure 1.

For this\nexample, choose 100mV.\n3) Calculate R1. R1 = R3 x (V HB / VCC). Plugging in the\nvalues for this example, \nR1 = 1.2M Ωx (100mV / 5.0V) = 24k Ω\n4) Choose the trip point for V INrising. This is the\nthreshold voltage at which the comparator switchesfrom low to high as V\nINrises above the trip point. In\nthis example, choose 3.0V.\n5) Calculate R2 as follows:\nChoose a standard value for R2 of 16k Ω.\n6) Verify the trip voltage and hysteresis as follows:\nIR Receiver\nThe Typical Operating Circuit shows an application using\nthe MAX998 as an infrared receiver. The infrared photo-diode creates a current relative to the amount of infraredlight present. This current creates a voltage across R\nD.\nWhen this voltage level crosses the voltage applied by thevoltage divider to the inverting input, the output transitions. Window Comparator\nThe MAX976 is ideal for making a window detector(undervoltage/overvoltage detector). The schematicshown in Figure 3 uses a MAX6120 reference and com-ponent values selected for a 2.0V undervoltage thresh-old and a 2.5V overvoltage threshold. Choose differentthresholds by changing the values of R1, R2, and R3.OUTA provides an active-low undervoltage indication,and OUTB gives an active-low overvoltage indication.ANDing the two outputs provides an active-high,power-good signal. The design procedure is as follows: \n1) Select R1. The leakage current into INB- is normally\n75nA, so the current through R1 should exceed1.0µA for the thresholds to be accurate. R1 values inthe 50kΩto 100kΩrange are typical.\n2) Choose the overvoltage threshold (V\nOTH) when V IN\nis rising, and calculate R2 and R3 with the following\nformula:\nRSUM = R2 + R3 = R1 x [V OTH/ (VREF+ VH) - 1]\nwhere V H= 1/2V HYST .\n3) Choose the undervoltage threshold (V UTH) when V IN\nis falling, and calculate R2 with the following formula:\nR2 = (R1 + R SUM) x [(V REF- VH) / VUTH] - R1\nwhere V H= 1/2V HYST .\n4) Calculate R3 with the following formula:\nR3 = (R SUM) - R2\n5) Verify the resistor values. The equations are as follows:\nVOTH= (V REF+ VH) x (R1 + R2 + R3) / R1\nVUTH= (V REF- VH) x (R1 + R2 + R3) / (R1 + R2)\nV  rising: V  =  V  x R1 x 1\nR1\nV  fallingIN THR REF\nIN     \n:       \n    ++⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\n=−⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\n=−1\n21\n3\n1\n3RR\nVVRx V\nR\nHysteresis V VTHF THRCC\nTHR THFR2 =  1\nV\nV  x R1 1\nR1  1\nR3\nR2 =  1\n3.0V\n1.2 x 24k 1\n24k  1\n1.2M  16.2kTHR\nREF⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟−−\n⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟−−=\nΩΩΩVCC\nMAX976\nMAX978MAX998OUT0.1µFR3\nR1\nR2\nVREFGNDVINVCC\nFigure 2.
