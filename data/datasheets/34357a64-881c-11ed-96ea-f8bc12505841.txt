The\nlow ON−state resistance (R on) of the switch allows\nconnections to be made with minimal propagation delay.When EN is HIGH, the translator switch is on, and the SCL1\nand SDA1 I/O are connected to the SCL2 and SDA2 I/O,respectively, allowing bidirectional data flow betweenports. When EN is LOW, the translator switch is off, and ahigh−impedance state exists between ports.\nThe PCA9306 is not a bus buffer that provides both level\ntranslation and physical capacitance isolation to either sideof the bus when both sides are connected. The PCA9306only isolates both sides when the device is disabled andprovides voltage level translation when active.\nThe PCA9306 can be used to run two buses, one at\n400 kHz operating frequency and the other at 100 kHzoperating frequency. If the two buses are operating at\ndifferent frequencies, the 100 kHz bus must be isolated\nwhen the 400 kHz operation of the other bus is required. Ifthe master is running at 400 kHz, the maximum systemoperating frequency may be less than 400 kHz because ofthe delays added by the translator.\nAs with the standard I\n2C−bus system, pull −up resistors are\nrequired to provide the logic HIGH levels on the translator’sbus. The PCA9306 has a standard open −collector\nconfiguration of the I2C−bus. The size of these pull −up\nresistors depends on the system, but each side of the\ntranslator must have a pull −up resistor. The device is\ndesigned to work with Standard −mode, Fast −mode and Fast\nmode Plus I2C−bus devices in addition to SMBus devices.\nThe maximum frequency is dependent on the RC timeconstant, but generally supports > 2 MHz.\nWhen the SDA1 or SDA2 port is LOW, the clamp is in the\nON−state and a low resistance connection exists between the\nSDA1 and SDA2 ports. Assuming the higher voltage is on\nthe SDA2 port, when the SDA2 port is HIGH, the voltage on\nthe SDA1 port is limited to the voltage set by VREF1. When\nthe SDA1 port is HIGH, the SDA2 port is pulled to the drainpull−up supply voltage (V\npu(D) ) by the pull −up resistors.\nThis functionality allows a seamless translation betweenhigher and lower voltages selected by the user without theneed for directional control. The SCL1/SCL2 channel alsofunctions as the SDA1/SDA2 channel.\nAll channels have the same electrical characteristics and\nthere is minimal deviation from one output to another involtage or propagation delay. This is a benefit over discrete\ntransistor voltage translation solutions, since the fabrication\nof the switch is symmetrical. The translator providesexcellent ESD protection to lower voltage devices, and at the\nsame time protects less ESD −resistant devices.\nFUNCTIONAL DIAGRAM\nFigure 1.

This allows VREF2 to regulate the EN\ninput. A filter capacitor on VREF2 is recommended. The\nI2C−bus master output can be totem −pole or open −drain\n(pull−up resistors may be required) and the I2C−bus device\noutput can be totem −pole or open −drain (pull −up resistors\nare required to pull the SCL2 and SDA2 outputs to V pu(D)).\nHowever, if either output is totem −pole, data must beunidirectional or the outputs must be 3 −stateable and be\ncontrolled by some direction −control mechanism to prevent\nHIGH−to−LOW contentions in either direction. If both\noutputs are open −drain, no direction control is needed.\nThe reference supply voltage (V ref(1)) is connected to the\nprocessor core power supply voltage. When VREF2 is\nconnected through a 200 k /C0087 resistor to a 3.3 V to 5.5 V\nVpu(D)  power supply, and V ref(1)  is set between 1.0 V and\n(Vpu(D)  − 1 V), the output of each SCL1 and SDA1 has a\nmaximum output voltage equal to VREF1, and the output of\neach SCL2 and SDA2 has a maximum output voltage equal\nto V pu(D) .\nPCA9306\nwww. onsemi.com\n8Table 8.

All typical values are at T amb  = 25 °C.\nSizing Pull −up Resistor\nThe pull−up resistor value needs to limit the current\nthrough the pass transistor when it is in the ON state to about\n15 mA. This ensures a pass voltage of 260 mV to 350 mV .If the current through the pass transistor is higher than15 mA, the pass voltage also is higher in the ON state. To set\nthe current through each pass transistor at 15 mA, the\npull−up resistor value is calculated as:\nRPU/C0043VPU(D)/C00420.35 V\n0.015 A(eq. 1)The following table summarizes resistor reference\nvoltages and currents at 15 mA, 10 mA, and 3 mA. Theresistor values shown in the +10% column or a larger value\nshould be used to ensure that the pass voltage of the\ntransistor would be 350 mV or l ess. The external driver must\nbe able to sink the total current from the resistors on bothsides of the PCA9306 device at 0.175 V, although the 15 mA\nonly applies to current flowing through the PCA9306device.\nTable 9.

Basically, the PCA9306 behaves like a wire withthe additional characteristics of transistor device physicsand should be capable of performing at higher frequencies\nif used correctly.\nHere are some guidelines to follow that will help\nmaximize the performance of the device:\n•Keep trace length to a minimum by placing the\nPCA9306 close to the processor.\n•The trace length should be less than half the time of\nflight to reduce ringing and reflections.\n•The faster the edge of the signal, the higher the chancefor ringing.\n•The higher the drive strength (up to 15 mA), the higherthe frequency the device can use.\nIn a 3.3 V to 1.8 V direction level shift, if the 3.3 V side\nis being driven by a totem pole type driver no pull −upresistor is needed on the 3.3 V side. The capacitance and line\nlength of concern is on the 1.8 V side since it is driventhrough the ON resistance of the PCA9306. If the line length\non the 1.8 V side is long enough there can be a reflection at\nthe chip/terminating end of the wire when the transition timeis shorter than the time of flight of the wire because thePCA9306 looks like a high −impedance compared to the\nwire. If the wire is not too long and the lumped capacitance\nis not excessive the signal will only be slightly degraded bythe series resistance added by passing through the PCA9306.If the lumped capacitance is large the rise time will\ndeteriorate, the fall time is much less affected and if the rise\ntime is slowed down too much the duty cycle of the clockwill be degraded and at  some point the clock will no longer\nbe useful. So the principle design consideration is tominimize the wire length and the capacitance on the 1.8 Vside for the clock path. A pull −up resistor on the 1.8 V side\ncan also be used to trade a slower fall time for a faster risetime and can also reduce the overshoot in some cases.\nUS8\nCASE 493\nISSUE F\nDATE 01 SEP 2021 SCALE 4 :1\nXX = Specific Device Code\nM = Date Code\n/C0071 = Pb−Free Package18\nXX M /C0071\n/C0071GENERIC\nMARKING DIAGRAM*\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)\n*This information is generic.
