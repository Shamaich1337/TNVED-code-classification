If 0.254mm (10 mil) thick alumina thin film substrates must be \nused,  the die should be raised 0.150mm (6 mils) so that the surface of \nthe die is coplanar with the surface of the substrate.  One way to accom -\nplish this is to attach the 0.102mm (4 mil) thick die to a 0.150mm (6 mil) \nthick molybdenum heat spreader (moly-tab) which is then attached to the \nground plane (Figure 2).\nMicrostrip substrates should be placed as close to the die as possible in \norder to minimize bond wire length.  Typical die-to-substrate spacing is \n0.076mm to 0.152 mm (3 to 6 mils).\nHandling Precautions\nFollow these precautions to avoid permanent damage.\nStorage:  All bare die are placed in either Waffle or Gel based ESD pro -\ntective containers, and then sealed in an ESD protective bag for shipment. \nOnce the sealed ESD protective bag has been opened, all die should be \nstored in a dry nitrogen environment.\nCleanliness:  Handle the chips in a clean environment. DO NOT attempt \nto clean the chip using liquid cleaning systems.\nStatic Sensitivity:  Follow ESD precautions to protect against ESD \nstrikes.\nTransients:  Suppress instrument and bias supply transients while bias is \napplied. Use shielded signal and bias cables to minimize inductive pick-up.\nGeneral Handling:  Handle the chip along the edges with a vacuum collet \nor with a sharp pair of bent tweezers. The surface of the chip may have \nfragile air bridges and should not be touched with vacuum collet, tweezers, or fingers.\nMounting\nThe chip is back-metallized and can be die mounted with AuSn eutectic preforms or with electrically conductive epoxy.  \nThe mounting surface should be clean and flat.\nEutectic Die Attach:  A 80/20 gold tin preform is recommended with a work surface temperature of 255 °C and a tool \ntemperature of 265 °C.  When hot 90/10 nitrogen/hydrogen gas is applied, tool tip temperature should be 290 °C. DO \nNOT expose the chip to a temperature greater than 320 °C for more than 20 seconds.  No more than 3 seconds of \nscrubbing should be required for attachment.\nEpoxy Die Attach:  Apply a minimum amount of epoxy to the mounting surface so that a thin epoxy fillet is observed \naround the perimeter of the chip once it is placed into position.  Cure epoxy per the manufacturer’s schedule.\nWire Bonding\nRF bonds made with two 1 mil wires are recommended.  These bonds should be thermosonically bonded with a force \nof 40-60 grams.  DC bonds of 0.001” (0.025 mm) diameter, thermosonically bonded, are recommended.  Ball bonds \nshould be made with a force of 40-50 grams and wedge bonds at 18-22 grams.  All bonds should be made with a \nnominal stage temperature of 150 °C.  A minimum amount of ultrasonic energy should be applied to achieve reliable \nbonds.  All bonds should be as short as possible, less than 12 mils (0.31 mm).0.102mm (0.004”) Thick GaAs MMIC\nWire Bond\nRF Ground Plane\n0.254mm (0.010”) Thick Alumina\nThin Film Substrate0.076mm\n(0.003”)\nFigure 2.0.150mm (0.005”) Thick\nMoly Tab\n0.102mm (0.004”) Thick GaAs MMIC\nWire Bond\nRF Ground Plane\n0.127mm (0.005”) Thick Alumina\nThin Film Substrate0.076mm\n(0.003”)\nFigure 1.\n'}]
