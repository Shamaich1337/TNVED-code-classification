This \npin must be locally bypassed with an external, low ESR \ncapacitor of at least 2.2µF.\nFIN (K3, L3): Filtered Input. This is the node after the input \nEMI filter. Use this only if there is a need to modify the \nbehavior of the integrated EMI filter or if V IN rises or falls \nrapidly; otherwise, leave these pins unconnected. See the \nApplications Information section for more details.GND (Bank 2): Tie these GND pins to a local ground plane \nbelow the LTM8032 and the circuit components. In most \napplications, the bulk of the heat flow out of the LTM8032 \nis through these pads, so the printed circuit design has a \nlarge impact on the thermal performance of the part. See \nthe PCB Layout and Thermal Considerations sections for \nmore details. Return the feedback divider ( R\nADJ) to this net.\nVOUT (Bank 1): Power Output Pins. Apply the output filter \ncapacitor and the output load between these pins and \nGND pins.\nAUX (Pin H5): Low Current Voltage Source for BIAS. The \nAUX pin is internally connected to V OUT and is placed \nadjacent to the BIAS pin to ease printed circuit board \nrouting. Although this pin is internally connected to V OUT, \ndo not connect this pin to the load. If this pin is not tied \nto BIAS, leave it floating.BIAS ( Pin H 4): The BIAS pin connects to the internal power  \nbus. Connect to a power source greater than 2.8V. If the \noutput is greater than 2.8V, connect this pin to AUX. If \nthe output voltage is less, connect this to a voltage source \nbetween 2.8V and 25V. Also, make sure that BIAS + V\nIN \nis less than 56V.RUN/SS (Pin L5): Pull RUN/SS pin to less than 0.2V to \nshut down the LTM8032. Tie to 2.5V or more for normal \noperation. If the shutdown feature is not used, tie this pin \nto the V IN pin. RUN/SS also provides a soft-start function; \nsee the Applications Information section.RT (Pin G7): The RT pin is used to program the switching \nfrequency of the LTM8032 by connecting a resistor from \nthis pin to ground. The Applications Information section of \nthe data sheet includes a table to determine the resistance \nvalue based on  the desired switching frequency. Minimize \ncapacitance at this pin.SHARE \n (Pin H7): Tie this to the SHARE pin of another \nLTM8032 when paralleling the outputs. Otherwise, do not \nconnect (leave floating).SYNC (Pin L6): This is the external clock synchronization \ninput. Ground this pin for low ripple Burst Mode\n® operation  \nat low output loads. Tie to a stable voltage source greater \nthan 0.7V to disable Burst Mode operation. Do not leave \nthis pin floating. Tie to a clock source for synchronization. \nClock edges should have rise and fall times faster than 1µs. \nSee synchronization section in Applications Information.\nPGOOD (Pin K7): The PGOOD pin is the open-collector \noutput  of an internal  comparator. PGOOD remains low until \nthe ADJ pin is within 10% of the final regulation voltage. \nThe PGOOD output is valid when V IN is above 3.6V and \nRUN/SS is high. If this function is not used, leave this \npin floating.ADJ (Pin J7): The LTM8032 regulates its ADJ pin to 0.79V. \nConnect the adjust resistor from this pin to ground. The \nvalue of R\nADJ is given by the equation:\n  RADJ=196.71\nVOUT– 0.79\nwhere R ADJ is in kΩ.\nLTM80328\n8032fg For more information www.linear .com/L TM8032block Diagra M\nCURRENT\nMODE\nCONTROLLER249k 10µFVOUT\nAUX\nGND4.7µH\nBIASEMI FIL TERFIN\nVIN\nGND\nSHARE\nSYNC RT PGOOD ADJ\n8032 BDRUN/SS\nLTM80329\n8032fg For more information www.linear .com/L TM8032opera Tion\napplica Tions inForMaTionThe LTM8032 is a standalone nonisolated step-down \nswitching DC/DC power supply. It can deliver up to 2A of \nDC output current with only bulk external input and output \ncapacitors. This module provides a precisely regulated \noutput voltage programmable via one external resistor \nfrom 0.8VDC to 10VDC. The input voltage range is 3.6V \nto 36V. Given that the LTM8032 is a step-down converter, \nmake sure that the input voltage is high enough to support \nthe desired output voltage and load current. A simplified \nBlock Diagram is given on the previous page.\nThe LTM8032 is designed with an input EMI filter and other \nfeatures to make its radiated emissions compliant with \nseveral EMC specifications including EN55022 class  B. \nCompliance \nwith conducted emissions requirements may \nbe obtained by adding a standard input filter.The LTM8032 contains a current mode controller, power \nswitching element, power inductor, power Schottky diode \nand a modest amount of input and output capacitance. \nThe LTM8032 is a fixed frequency PWM  regulator. The \nswitching frequency is set by simply connecting the ap -\npropriate resistor value from the RT  pin to GND.An\n internal regulator provides power to the control circuitry. \nThe bias regulator can draw  power from the V IN pin, but if \nthe BIAS pin is connected to an external voltage higher than \n2.8V, bias power will be drawn from the external source \n(typically the regulated output voltage). This improves \nefficiency. The RUN/SS pin is used to place the LTM8032 \nin shutdown, disconnecting the output and reducing the \ninput current to less than 1µA.To further optimize efficiency, the LTM8032 automatically \nswitches to Burst Mode operation in light load situations. \nBetween bursts, all circuitry associated with controlling \nthe output switch is shut down reducing the input supply \ncurrent to 50µA in a typical application. The oscillator \nreduces the LTM8032’s operating frequency when the \nvoltage at the ADJ pin is low. This frequency foldback helps  \nto control the output current during start-up and overload.\nThe LTM8032 contains a power good comparator which \ntrips when the ADJ pin is at 90% of its regulated value. \nThe PGOOD output is an open-collector transistor that is \noff when the output is in regulation, allowing an external \nresistor to pull the PGOOD pin high. Power good is valid \nwhen the LTM8032 is enabled and V\nIN is above 3.6V.\nFor most applications, the design process is straight \nfor\nward, summarized as follows:\n1. Look \nat Table 1 and find the row that has the desired \ninput range and output voltage.\n2. Apply the\n recommended C IN, COUT, RADJ and R T  \nvalues.\n3. Connect BIAS as indicated. \nAs \nthe integrated input EMI filter may ring in response to \nan application of a step input voltage, a bulk capacitance, \nseries resistance or some clamping mechanism may be \nrequired. See the Hot-Plugging Safely section for details. \nWhile these component combinations have been tested for proper operation, it is incumbent upon the user to \nverify proper operation over the intended system’s line, load and environmental conditions. Capacitor Selection Considerations\nThe C\nIN and C OUT capacitor values in Table 1 are the \nminimum recommended values for the associated oper-\nating conditions . Applying capacitor values below those \nindicated in Table 1 is not recommended, and may result \nin undesirable operation. Using larger values is generally \nacceptable, and can yield improved dynamic response, if \nit is necessary. Again, it is incumbent upon the user to \nverify proper operation over the intended system’s line, load and environmental conditions.\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However, not all ceramic capacitors  \n are suitable. \nX5R and X7R types are stable over temperature and ap-\nplied voltage  and give dependable service.

Ceramic capacitors are also piezoelectric. In  \nBurst Mode operation, the LTM8032’s switching frequency  \ndepends on the load current, and can excite a ceramic \ncapacitor at audio frequencies, generating audible noise. \nSince the LTM8032 operates at a lower current limit during \nBurst Mode operation, the noise is typically very quiet to \na casual ear. If this audible noise is unacceptable, use a \nhigh performance electrolytic capacitor at the output. The \ninput capacitor can be a parallel combination of a 2.2µF \nceramic capacitor and a low cost electrolytic capacitor.\nA final precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns \nthe maximum input voltage rating of the LTM8032. A \nceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable \ninductance forms a high Q (under damped) tank circuit. \nIf the LTM8032 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the \ninput voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, possi -\nbly exceeding the device’s rating. This situation is easily \navoided; see the Hot-Plugging Safely section.\nElectromagnetic Compliance\nThe LTM8032 is compliant with the radiated emissions \nrequirements of EN55022 class B . Graphs  of the  LTM8032’s \nEMC performance are given in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section. Further data, operating conditions \nand test setup are detailed in an EMI Test report available \nfrom the Linear Technology website. \nFrequency Selection\nThe LTM8032 uses a constant frequency PWM  architecture  \nthat can be programmed to switch from 200kHz to 2.4MHz \nby using a resistor tied from the RT pin to ground. Table  2 \nprovides \na list of R T resistor values and their resultant \nfrequencies.\nOperating Frequency T rade-Offs\nIt is recommended that the user apply the optimal R T \nvalue given in Table 1 for the input and output operating \ncondition. System level or other considerations, however, \nmay necessitate another operating frequency. While the \nLTM8032 is flexible enough to accommodate a wide range \nof operating frequencies, a haphazardly chosen one may result in undesirable operation under certain operating or \nfault conditions. A frequency that is too high can reduce \nefficiency, generate excessive heat or even damage the \nLTM8032 if the output is overloaded or short-circuited. \nA frequency that is too low can result in a final design \nthat has too much output ripple or too large of an output \ncap. The maximum frequency (and attendant R T value) at \nwhich the LTM8032 should be allowed to switch is given \nin Table 1 in the f MAX column, while the recommended \nfrequency (and R T value) for optimal efficiency over the \ngiven input condition is given in the f OPTIMAL  column. \nThere are additional conditions that must be satisfied if \nthe synchronization function is used. Please refer to the \nSynchronization section for details.\nBIAS Pin Considerations\nThe BIAS pin is used to provide drive power for the internal \npower switching stage and operate internal circuitry. For \nproper operation, it must be powered by at least 2.8V. If \nthe output voltage is programmed to be 2.8V or higher, \nsimply tie BIAS to AUX. If V OUT is less than 2.8V, BIAS \ncan be tied to V IN or some other voltage source. In all \ncases, ensure that the maximum voltage at the BIAS pin \nis both less than 25V and the sum of V IN and BIAS is less Table 2.

If BIAS power is applied from a remote or noisy \nvoltage source, it may be necessary to apply a decoupling \ncapacitor locally to the LTM8032.\nLoad Sharing\nTw o or more LTM8032s may be paralleled to produce higher  \ncurrents. This may, however, alter the EMI performance \nof the LTM8032s. To do this, tie the V IN, ADJ, V OUT and \nSHARE pins of all the paralleled LTM8032s together. To \nensure that paralleled modules start up together, the RUN/\nSS pins may be tied together, as well. Synchronize the \nLTM8032s to an external clock to eliminate beat frequen -\ncies, if  required. If the RUN/SS pins are not tied together, \nmake \nsure that the same valued soft-start capacitors \nare used for each module. An example of two LTM8032 \nmodules configured for load sharing is given in the Typical \nApplications section.For current sharing applications using multiple LTM8032s, \nthe ADJ pins for all regulators may be combined using \none resistor to ground as determined by:\n  RADJ=196.71\nN\nVOUT– 0.79\nwhere N is the number of paralleled modules and R ADJ \nis in kΩ.\nBurst Mode Operation\nTo enhance efficiency at light loads, the LTM8032 auto -\nmatically switches  to Burst Mode operation which keeps \nthe output capacitor charged to the proper voltage while \nminimizing the input quiescent current. During Burst Mode  \noperation, the LTM8032 delivers single cycle bursts of \ncurrent to the output capacitor followed by sleep periods \nwhere the output power is delivered to the load by the output  \ncapacitor. In addition, V IN and BIAS quiescent currents are \nreduced to typically 25µA and 60µA respectively during \nthe sleep time. As the load current decreases towards a \nno-load condition, the percentage of time that the LTM8032  \noperates in sleep mode increases and the average input \ncurrent is greatly reduced, resulting in higher efficiency. \nBurst Mode operation is enabled by tying SYNC to GND. Figure 1. The LTM8032 Needs More Voltage to Start Than RunTo disable Burst Mode operation, tie SYNC to a stable \nvoltage above 0.7V or synchronize to an external clock. \nDo not leave the SYNC pin floating.\nMinimum Input Voltage\nThe LTM8032 is a step-down converter, so a minimum \namount of headroom is required to keep the  output in \nregulation. In addition, the input voltage required to turn \non \nis higher than that required to run, and depends upon \nwhether the RUN/SS is used. As shown in Figure 1, it \ntakes only about 3.6V IN for the LTM8032 to run a 3.3V \noutput at light load. If RUN/SS is tied directly to V IN, a \n5.5V input voltage is required to start. If V IN is allowed to \nsettle in the operating region first then the RUN/SS pin is \nenabled, the minimum input voltage to start at light load is lower, about 4.7V.

The \nRUN/SS pin is driven through an external RC network to \ncreate a voltage ramp at this pin. Figure 2 shows the start-\nup and shutdown waveforms with the soft-start circuit. By \nchoosing an appropriate RC time constant, the peak start- up \ncurrent can be reduced to the current that is required to \nregulate the output, with no overshoot. Choose the value of the resistor so that it can supply at least 20µA when \nthe RUN/SS pin reaches 2.5V.applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 2. To  Soft-Start the LTM8032, Add a Resistor \nand Capacitor to the RUN/SS PinShorted Input Protection\nCare needs to be taken in systems where the output will \nbe held high when the input to the LTM8032 is absent. \nThis may occur in battery charging applications or in \nbattery back-up systems where a battery or some other \nsupply is diode ORed with the LTM8032’s output. If the \nVIN pin is allowed to float and the RUN/SS pin is held high \n(either by a logic signal or because it is tied  to V IN), then \nthe LTM8032’s internal circuitry will pull its quiescent \ncurrent through its internal power switch. This is fine if \nyour system can tolerate a few milliamps in this state. If \nyou ground the RUN/SS pin, the internal switch current \nwill drop to essentially zero. However, if the V IN pin is \ngrounded while the output is held high, then parasitic \ndiodes inside the LTM8032 can pull large currents from \nthe output through the V IN pin, potentially damaging the \ndevice. Figure 3 shows a circuit that will run only when \nthe input voltage is present and that protects against a \nshorted or reversed input.\nFigure 3.

Place \nthe C IN and C OUT capacitors such that their \nground currents flow directly adjacent or underneath \nthe LTM8032.\n5. Connect \nall of the GND connections to as large a copper \npour or plane area as possible on the top layer.

Liberally distribute these GND vias \nto provide both a good ground connection and thermal \npath to the internal planes of the printed circuit board. \nLTM803215\n8032fg For more information www.linear .com/L TM8032Hot-Plugging Safely\nThe small size, robustness and low impedance of ceramic \ncapacitors make them an attractive option for the input \nbypass capacitor of LTM8032. However, these capacitors \ncan cause problems if the LTM8032 is plugged into a live \nor fast rising or falling supply (see Linear Technology \nApplication Note 88 for a complete discussion). The low \nloss ceramic capacitor combined with stray inductance in \nseries with the power source forms an under-damped tank \ncircuit, and the voltage at the V IN pin of the LTM8032 can \nring to twice the nominal input voltage, possibly exceeding \nthe LTM8032’s rating and damaging the part. A similar \nphenomenon can occur inside the LTM8032 module, at the \noutput of the integrated EMI filter, with the same potential \nof damaging the part.\nIf the input supply is poorly controlled or the user will be \nplugging the LTM8032 into an energized supply, the input \nnetwork should  be designed to prevent this overshoot. Fig -\nure 5 shows the waveforms that result when an LTM8032 \ncircuit is connected to a 24V supply through six feet of \n24-gauge twisted pair. The first plot (5a) is the response applica Tions inForMaTion\nwith a 2.2µF ceramic capacitor at the input. The input \nvoltage \nrings as high as 35V and the input current peaks \nat 20A. One method of damping the tank circuit is to add \nanother capacitor with a series resistor to the circuit. An \nalternative solution is shown in Figure  5b. \nA 0.7Ω resistor \nis added in series with the input to eliminate the voltage \novershoot (it also reduces the peak input current). A 0.1µF \ncapacitor improves high frequency filtering. For high input \nvoltages its impact on efficiency is minor, reducing ef -\nficiency less than one-half percent for a 5V output at full \nload \noperating from 24V. By far the most popular method \nof controlling overshoot is shown in Figure 5c, where an \naluminum electrolytic capacitor has been connected to FIN. \nThis capacitor’s high equivalent series resistance damps \nthe circuit and eliminates the voltage overshoot. The extra \ncapacitor improves low frequency ripple filtering and can \nslightly improve the efficiency of the circuit, though it is likely to be the largest component in the circuit. Figure 5c  \nshows  the c\napacitor  added  to the V IN terminals, but placing  \nthe electrolytic capacitor at the FIN terminals can improve the LTM8032’s EMI filtering as well as guard against \novershoots  caused by the Q of the integrated filter.\nLTM803216\n8032fg For more information www.linear .com/L TM8032applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 5.

The amount \nof current derating is dependent upon the input voltage, \noutput power and ambient temperature. The temperature \nrise curves given in the Typical Performance Character -\nistics section  can be used as a guide. These curves were \ngenerated by an LTM8032 mounted to a 36cm2 4-layer FR4 \nprinted circuit board. Boards of other sizes and layer count \ncan exhibit different thermal behavior, so it is incumbent \nupon the user to verify proper operation over the intended \nsystem’s line, load and environmental operating conditions.\nThe thermal resistance numbers listed in the Pin Con -\nfiguration are based on modeling the µModule package \nmounted on a test board specified per JESD51-9 “Test \nBoards for Area Array Surface Mount Package Thermal \nMeasurements.” The thermal coefficients provided in this \npage are based on  JESD 51-12 “Guidelines for Reporting \nand Using Electronic Package Thermal Information.”\nFor increased accuracy and fidelity to the actual application, \nmany designers use FEA to predict thermal performance.  \nTo that end, the Pin Configuration typically gives four \nthermal coefficients:  •\n θJA – Thermal resistance from junction to ambient. \n• θJCbottom  – Thermal resistance from junction to the \nbottom of the product case.\n• θJCtop – Thermal resistance from junction to top of \nthe product case.\n• θJB – Thermal resistance from junction to the printed \ncircuit board. While the meaning of each of these coefficients may seem \nto be intuitive, JEDEC has defined each to avoid confu -\nsion and  inconsistency. These definitions are given in  \nJESD\n 51-12, and are quoted  or paraphrased in the following:\n• θJA is the natural convection junction-to-ambient air \nthermal resistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed \nenclosure. This environment is sometimes referred to as \n“still air” although natural convection causes the air to \nmove.  This value is determined with the part mounted to \na JESD 51-9 defined test board, which does not reflect \nan actual application or viable operating condition.\n• θJCbottom  is the junction-to-board thermal resistance \nwith all of the component power dissipation flowing \nthrough the bottom of the package. In the typical \nµModule regulator, the bulk of the heat flows out the \nbottom of the package, but there is always heat flow out into the ambient environment. As a result, this thermal \nresistance value may be useful for comparing packages \nbut \nthe test conditions don’t generally match the user’s \napplication.\n• θJCtop is determined with nearly all of the component \npower dissipation flowing through the top of the pack-\nage. As the  electrical connections of the typical µ Module  \nregulator are on the bottom of the package, it is rare \nfor an application to operate such that most of the heat \nflows from the junction to the top of the part. As in the \ncase of θJCbottom , this value  may be useful  for comparing  \npackages but the test conditions don’t generally match \nthe user’s application.\n• θJB is the junction-to-board thermal resistance where \nalmost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the \nµModule regulator and into the board, and is really the \nsum of the θJCbottom  and the thermal resistance of the \nbottom of the part through the solder joints and through \na portion of the board. The board temperature is mea -\nsured a specified distance from the package, using a \ntwo \nsided, two layer board. This board is described in \nJESD 51-9.applica Tions inForMaTion\nLTM803218\n8032fg For more information www.linear .com/L TM8032The most appropriate way to use the coefficients is when \nrunning a detailed thermal analysis, such as FEA, which \nconsiders all of the thermal resistances simultaneously. \nNone of them can be individually used to accurately pre -\ndict the  thermal performance of the product, so it would \nbe \ninappropriate to attempt to use any one coefficient to \ncorrelate to the junction temperature versus load graphs \ngiven in the LTM8032 data sheet. \nA graphical representation of these thermal resistances \nis given in Figure 6.The blue resistances are contained within the µModule \nregulator, and the green are outside.The die temperature of the LTM8032 must be lower than \nthe maximum rating of 125°C, so care should be taken \nin the layout of the circuit to ensure good heat sinking \nof the LTM8032. The bulk of the heat flow out of the \nLTM8032 is through the bottom of the module and the \npads into the printed circuit board. Consequently a poor \nprinted circuit board design can cause excessive heating,  \nresulting in impaired performance or reliability. Please \nrefer \nto the PCB Layout section for printed circuit board \ndesign suggestions.\nFinally, be aware that at high ambient temperatures the \ninternal Schottky diode will have significant  leakage current  \nincreasing the quiescent current of the LTM8032.applica Tions inForMaTion\n8032 F06\nµMODULE REGULATORJUNCTION-TO-CASE (TOP)\nRESISTANCE\nJUNCTION-TO-BOARD RESISTANCEJUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT RESISTANCE (JESD 51-9 DEFINED BOARD)\nCASE (TOP)-TO-AMBIENT\nRESISTANCE\nBOARD-TO-AMBIENT\nRESISTANCEJUNCTION-TO-CASE\n(BOTTOM) RESISTANCEJUNCTION At\nCASE (BOTTOM)-TO-BOARD\nRESISTANCE\nFigure 6\nLTM803219\n8032fg For more information www.linear .com/L TM8032Typical applica Tions\n0.82V Step-Down Converter\n1.8V Step-Down ConverterRTSHARE\n5.62M\n*RUNNING VOL TAGE RANGE. \n  SEE APPLICATIONS FOR START-UP DETAILS150kVIN\nFIN 2.2µF 200µFVOUT\n0.82V2A\nRUN/SSV\nIN*\n3.6VDC TO 24VDC\nPGOODBIASL TM8032\nAUXVOUT\nSYNC GND\n8032 TA02ADJ\nRTSHARE\n196k\n*RUNNING VOL TAGE RANGE.
