Using the resistor in the following specific\nenvironments or service conditions may affect the performance/reliability of the resistor. Avoid using it in such specific \nenvironments. If you intend to use the resistor in such environments, checking the performance, reliability, etc., of the \nproduct sufficiently is your own responsibility.\n(1) Used in liquid, such as water, oil, chemicals, and organic solvents.\n(2) Used in a place exposed to direct sunlight, an outdoor place with no shielding, or a dusty place.\n(3) Used in a place where the product is heavily exposed to sea breeze or a corrosive gas, such as Cl 2, H2S, NH 3, SO 2,\nor NO X.\n(4) Used in an environment where static electricity and electromagnetic waves are strong.\n(5) Located close to a heating component or a flammable material, such as a vinyl cable placed near the product.\n(6) Sealed or coated with a resin.\n(7) Solder flux of the resistor soldered with no-clean type solder, etc., is cleansed with a solvent, water, or a water-soluble \ncleaner, etc. (Water-soluble flux residues have a particularly large influence on a resistor.)\n(8) Used in a place where dew concentrates on the product.(9) Used in a contaminated state.\n(Example: Touching the resistor mounted on a printed board leaving sebum on the resistor (improper handling))\n■ Sealing the resistor with a resin in a resin potting process, damp-proofing process, etc., applies excessive stress to the\nresistor, which may cause the internal electrodes a connection problem. In such cases, the proper operation of the resistor is not guaranteed. If you intend to use the resistor in such environments, checking the performance, reliability, etc., \nof the product sufficiently is your own responsibility.\n■ Do not leave the resistor immersed in a solvent for a long time. When using the resistor immersed in a solvent, confirm\nthe operation of the product mounted on the board.\n■ When a cleaning solution or cleaning condition for cleaning the printed board or a drying condition for drying the printed\nboard after soldering the resistor is improper, it may have a negative effect on the performance/reliability of the resistor. \nConfirming these conditions sufficiently is your own responsibility. Also examine the effects of soiled cleaning agent, \ncleaning residues, and post-cleaning contaminations, and control for these effects properly.\n■ When the resistor is heating abnormally or emitting a smell, stop using the resistor immediately, for example, turn off\nthe main power supply of the device.\nAlso, keep your face and hands away from the product as it may become hot and cause burns.\n■ The resistor is so thin that it may break easily when subjected to impact. Before putting the resistor in use, confirm that\nthe resistor has not been broken by impact that applied thereto when mounted on the printed board. Applying impact to the resistor or pinching the resistor with a hard tool (pliers, tweezers, etc.) may chip the resistor or its protective film, \nwhich affects its performance. Be careful to avoid such cases.\n■ Do not reuse a resistor having been used on a printed board and removed therefrom. Do not touch the resistor with your\nbare hands.\n■ Be careful not to drop the resistor on the floor, etc. The resistor is likely to suffer mechanical or electrical damage when\ndropped on the floor. Avoid using said resistor.\n■ The resistor may have its resistance value changed due to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Take ESD prevention measures\nwhen handling the resistor. ESD prevention measures include an environment where static electricity is not likely to be generated (recommended RH: 40% to 60%), by wearing an earth band, conductive gloves, etc., grounding the device in which the resistor is incorporated, and placing a conductive mat, etc., on a work platform.\n■ It is guaranteed that a resistor not exposed to any stress will have its proper resistance value. Any stress or pressure\napplied to the resistor may cause its resistance value to change. Examine and evaluate the characteristics of the resistor sufficiently before using it.\n30-Jun-23Matters to Be Observed When Using This Product\n(Fixed resistor)\n\u3000Use environments and cleaning conditions\n\u3000Response to anomalies and handling conditions\n\nMatters to Be Observed When Using This Product\nA product conforming to "AEC-Q200" refers to a product having passed some or all of the evaluation test items defined \nin AEC-Q200. To know the detailed specifications of individual products or specific evaluation test scores, please contact us.\nWe issue a delivery specification sheet for each product ordered. Please confirm with the sheet when you place an order \nwith us.\n■ To prevent a case where a transient load (e.g., a pulse for a short period) too large for the product to handle is applied,\nmake sure to evaluate and confirm the operation of the product incorporated in your product. Applying power or voltage \n(current) larger than the rated power or rated voltage (current) to the resistor may impair its performance and reliability. \nMake sure to use the resistor with power or voltage (current) equal to or lower than the rated power or rated voltage\n(current). The product warranty does not cover usage where an excessively large load, such as a pulse current, is \napplied to the product.\n■ The resistor may have a high temperature even when used with power equal to or lower than the rated power. Be careful\nin such cases. Another factor to be considered are effects on the board, peripheral components, etc., and the effects of \nperipheral components on the resistor. Make sure to confirm first that the temperature of the resistor incorporated in your \nproduct is equal to or lower than the specified temperature, and then use the resistor.\n■ When the resistors are connected in series or parallel, loads applied respectively to the resistors may not be equal to\neach other. Check whether the loads are equal in the actual circuit in which the resistors are incorporated.\n■ When a resistor is used in a high-frequency circuit, the resistor may fail to offer the required characteristics. Check\nwhether the resistor offers the required characteristics in the actual circuit in which the resistors are incorporated.\n■ Be careful that unusual stress caused by an excessive bend of the printed board is not applied to the resistor. Design the\ncircuit structure such that the resistor is not close to a perforated line for board splitting or on a line with sizable holes \nbored on the board.\n■ When a different component is mounted on the board where the resistor has been soldered, be careful that the board\ndoes not bend excessively. If necessary, provide the board with backup pins (support pins) to keep it straight.\n■ Avoid manual board splitting. Use a jig, etc., to break the board so that it does not bend excessively when split apart.\n■ When the product is used under mounting conditions departing from mounting conditions specified in our specification\nsheet, the product may be exposed to unexpected stress to fail. Be careful to avoid such a case. When mounting the resistor on a printed board, set the resistor’s front and back surfaces in the direction indicated by the tape. Make sure to \nevaluate and confirm the operation of the resistor incorporated in your product and determine whether the resistor is \nusable as a component of the product.\n■ Set soldering conditions for the resistor within the recommended soldering conditions specified by our company. Any time,\nsoldering condition departing from the specified soldering condition, such as a high peak temperature or a long heating \nmay impair the performance/reliability of the resistor. Note that the specified soldering conditions indicate conditions \nunder which degradation of the resistor characteristics does not occur but do not indicate conditions under which stable soldering can be performed. Check and set individual conditions under which stable soldering can be performed.\n■ Heat the resistor in advance so that a difference between the soldering temperature and the temperature of the resistor\nsurface is reduced to 100 ℃  or lower. When dipping the soldered resistor in a solvent, etc., to cool the resistor rapidly, \nensure that the temperature difference between the resistor and the solvent is 100 ℃  or lower during the dipping. \u3000\n■ When soldering the resistor using a soldering iron, apply hot air, etc., to the resistor to heat it sufficiently in advance and\nthen solder the resistor without bringing the soldering iron tip into contact with the product. If the temperature of the \nsoldering iron tip is high, finish the soldering work quickly (within 3 seconds when the temperature of the soldering iron \ntip is 350 ℃  or lower). In the case of a fixed resistor with low resistance, the resistor may fail to offer the exactly intended \nresistance value because of the variation in the solder volume, etc. Make sure to confirm the resistance value of the \nresistor in the actual circuit configuration.\n30-Jun-23\u3000Reliability and product life\n\u3000Circuit design and circuit board design\n\u3000Mounting conditions\n\nMatters to Be Observed When Using This Product / Reference Information\n■ Soldering the resistor with too much solder or too little solder results in the poor reliability of the solder connection of the\nresistor. Use the proper volume of solder in the soldering process. Sufficiently check for the volume of solder used.\n■ Soldering with high bond strength or special property solder may affect the quality of the resistor. Do not use such solder.\n■ Use rosin-based solder flux. When using highly active solder flux made mainly of halogen (chlorine, bromine, etc.), flux\nresidues may affect the performance and reliability of the resistor. Check the effects of flux residues before using the solder \nflux. Do not use highly acidic flux, water-soluble flux, or flux containing fluoride ions. When solder flux sticks to the resistor after the soldering process, the activation energy of the flux may corrode the resistor and cause it to fail.
