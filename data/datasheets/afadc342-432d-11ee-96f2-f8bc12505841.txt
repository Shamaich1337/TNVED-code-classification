Features\napplicationsDescription2.7GHz, 5V, Low Noise,  \nRail-to-Rail Input Differential \nAmplifier/Driver\nThe LT C®6405 is a very low noise, low distortion, fully \ndifferential input/output amplifier optimized for 5V, single \nsupply operation. The LTC6405 input common mode range  \nis rail-to-rail, while the output common mode voltage is \nindependently adjustable by applying a voltage on the V\nOCM pin. This makes the LTC6405 ideal for level shifting \nsignals with a wide common mode range for driving 12-bit \nto 16-bit single supply, differential input ADCs.\nA 2.7GHz gain-bandwidth product results in 65dB linearity \nfor 50MHz input signals. The LTC6405 is unity gain stable \nand the closed- loop bandwidth extends from DC to 800MHz. \nThe output voltage swing extends from near-ground to \n4V, to be compatible with a wide range of ADC converter \ninput requirements. The LTC6405 draws only 18mA, and \nhas a hardware shutdown feature which reduces current \nconsumption to 400µA.The LTC6405 is available in a compact 3mm × 3mm 16\n-pin \nleadless \nQFN package, as well  as an 8-lead MSOP package, \nand operates over a –40°C to 85°C temperature range.\nSingle-Ended Input to Differential Output \nwith Common Mode Level Shiftingn Low Noise: 1.6nV/√ Hz  RTI\nn Low Power: 18mA at 5V\nn Low Distortion (HD2/HD3): \n –82\ndBc/–65dBc at 50MHz, 2V P-P \n –97\ndBc/–91dBc at 25MHz, 2V P-P\nn Rail-to-Rail Differential Input\nn 4.5V to 5.25V Supply Voltage Range\nn Fully Differential Input and Output\nn Adjustable Output Common Mode Voltage\nn 800MHz –3dB Bandwidth with A V = 1\nn Gain-Bandwidth Product: 2.7GHz\nn Low Power Shutdown\nn Available in 8-Lead MSOP and 16-Lead  \n3mm × 3mm × 0.75mm QFN Packages\nn Differential Input ADC Driver\nn Single-Ended to Differential Conversion\nn Level-Shifting Ground-Referenced Signals\nn Level-Shifting V CC-Referenced Signals\nn High-Linearity Direct Conversion Receivers\nInput Noise Density vs Input \nCommon Mode Voltagetypical application\n–+200/uni03A9\n5V\nVOCM2.5V0V\n6405 TA01VS\n1VP-P\n200/uni03A90.1µF196/uni03A9\nL TC6405UD\n0.01µF\n1.8pF50/uni03A9\nSIGNAL\nGENERATOR61.9/uni03A9\n221/uni03A92.5V\n1VP-P2VP-P\n1.8pF\n6405 TA01b2 3.5 3 0.5 1 1.5 2.50 4.5 4 54\n321043210\nVS = 5V\nNOISE MEASURED AT f = 1MHz\nin\nenINPUT VOL TAGE NOISE DENSITY (nV/  Hz)INPUT CURRENT NOISE DENSITY (pA/  Hz)\nINPUT COMMON MODE VOL TAGE (V)\nLTC6405\n2\n6405fb\nFor more information www.linear .com/6405absolute Maxi MuM ratings\nTotal Supply  Voltage  (V+ to V–) ................................ 5. 5V\nInput  Current   \n(+IN, –IN, VOCM, SHDN , VTIP) (Note 2) ............ ±1 0mA\nOutput  Short -Circuit  Duration  (Note 3) ............

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: Input pins (+IN, –IN, V\nOCM, SHDN and V TIP) are protected by \nsteering diodes to either supply. If the inputs should exceed either supply \nvoltage, the input current should be limited to less than 10mA. In addition, the inputs +IN, –IN are protected by a pair of back-to-back diodes. If the differential input voltage exceeds 1.4V, the input current should be limited to less than 10mA. \nNote 3: A heat sink may be required to keep the junction temperature \nbelow the Absolute Maximum Rating when the output is shorted indefinitely. \nNote 4: The LTC6405C/LTC6405I are guaranteed functional over the \noperating temperature range –40°C to 85°C.\nNote 5: The LTC6405C is guaranteed to meet specified performance from \n0°C to 70°C. The LTC6405C is designed, characterized, and expected to meet specified performance from –40°C to 85°C but is not tested or QA sampled at these temperatures. The LTC6405I is guaranteed to meet specified performance from –40°C to 85°C.\nNote 6: Input  bias current is defined as the average of the input currents \nflowing  into the inputs (–IN, and +IN). Input Offset current is defined as \nthe difference between the input currents (I\nOS = IB+ – IB–).\nNote 7: Input common mode range is tested using the test circuit of Figure \n1 by taking 3 measurements of differential gain with a ±1VDC differential output with V\nICM = 0V; V ICM = 2.5V; V ICM = 5V, verifying that the \ndifferential gain has not deviated from the V ICM = 2.5V case by more than \n0.5%, and that the common mode offset (V OSCM ) has not deviated from \nthe common mode offset at V ICM = 2.5V by more than ±35mV.\nThe voltage range for the output common mode range is tested using the test circuit of Figure 1 by applying a voltage on the V\nOCM pin and testing at \nboth V OCM = 2.5V and at the Electrical Characteristics table limits to verify \nthat the common mode offset (V OSCM ) has not deviated by more than \n±20mV from the V OCM = 2.5V case.Note 8: Input CMRR is defined as the ratio of the change in the input common mode voltage at the pins +IN or –IN to the change in differential input referred  voltage offset. Output CMRR is defined as the ratio of \nthe change in the voltage at the V\nOCM pin to the change in differential \ninput referred voltage offset. This specification is strongly dependent on feedback ratio matching between the two outputs and their respective inputs, and it is difficult to measure actual amplifier performance. (See the “Effects of Resistor Pair Mismatch” in the Applications Information section of this data sheet.) For a better indicator of actual amplifier performance independent of feedback component matching, refer to the PSRR specification.\nNote 9: Differential Power Supply Rejection (PSRR) is defined as the \nratio of the change in supply voltage to the change in differential input referred voltage offset. Common mode power supply rejection (PSRRCM) is defined as the ratio of the change in supply voltage to the change in the common mode offset, V\nOUTCM  – V OCM.\nNote 10: Extended operation with the output shorted may cause the junction temperature to exceed the 150°C limit.\nNote 11: Because the LTC6405 is a feedback amplifier with low output \nimpedance, a resistive load is not required when driving an ADC. Therefore, typical output power can be very small in many applications. In order to compare the LTC6405 with “RF style” amplifiers that require 50Ω \nload, the output voltage swing is converted to dBm as if the outputs were \ndriving a 50Ω load. For example, 2V\nP-P output swing is equal to 10dBm \nusing this convention.\nNote 12: Includes offset/drift induced by feedback resistors mismatch. See \nthe Applications Information section for more details.\nNote 13: QFN package only—refer to datasheet curves for MSOP package \nnumbers.electrical characteristics\nLTC6405\n6\n6405fb\nFor more

2/Pin 4): Output Common Mode Reference \nVoltage. The voltage on V OCM sets the output common \nmode voltage level (which is defined as the average of the \nvoltages on the +OUT and –OUT pins). The V OCM voltage \nis internally set by a resistive divider between the supplies, \ndeveloping a default voltage potential of 2.5V with a 5V \nsupply. The V OCM pin can be over-driven by an external \nvoltage capable of driving the 19kΩ Thevenin equivalent \nimpedance presented by the pin. The V OCM pin should be \nbypassed with a high quality ceramic bypass capacitor of at \nleast 0.01µF, to minimize common mode noise from being \nconverted to differential noise by impedance mismatches \nboth externally and internally to the IC.\nV+ (Pin 3/Pins 2, 10, 11):\nV– (Pin 6/Pins 3, 9, 12): \nPower Supply Pins. It is critical that close attention be \npaid to supply bypassing. For single supply applications, \nit is recommended that a high quality 0.1µF surface mount \nceramic bypass capacitor be placed between V+ and V– with \ndirect short connections. In addition, V– should be tied \ndirectly to a low impedance ground plane with minimal \nrouting. For dual ( split) power supplies, it is recommended  \nthat additional high quality, 0.1µF ceramic capacitors are \nused to bypass V+ to ground and V– to ground, again \nwith minimal routing. For driving large loads (<200Ω), \nadditional bypass capacitance may be needed for optimal \nperformance. Keep in mind that small geometry ( e.g., 0603 \nor smaller) surface mount ceramic capacitors have a much \nhigher self resonant frequency than do leaded capacitors, and perform best in high speed applications.\n+OUT, –OUT (Pins 4, 5/Pins 7, 14): Unfiltered Output \nPins. Besides driving the feedback network, each pin \ncan drive an additional 50Ω to ground with typical short circuit current limiting of ±60mA. Each amplifier output \nis designed to drive a load capacitance of 5pF. Larger capacitive loads should be decoupled with at least 15Ω resistors from each output.\nV\nTIP (Pin 5) QFN Only: This pin can normally be left float-\ning. It determines which pair of input transistors (NPN or \nPNP or both) is sensing the input signal. The V TIP pin is \nset by an internal resistive divider between the supplies, \ndeveloping a default 2.8V voltage with a 5V supply. V TIP \nhas a Thevenin equivalent resistance of approximately \n17k and can be over-driven by an external voltage. The \nVTIP pin should be bypassed with a high quality ceramic \nbypass \ncapacitor of at least 0.01µF.

The LTC6405 is optimized to \ndrive low voltage, single-supply, differential input analog-\nto-digital converters (ADCs). The LTC6405 input common \nmode range is rail-to-rail, while the output common mode \nvoltage is independently adjustable by applying a voltage \non the V OCM pin. The output voltage swing extends from \nnear-ground to 4V, to be compatible with a wide range of \nADC converter input requirements. This  makes the LTC6405  \nideal for level shifting signals with a wide common mode \nrange for driving 12-bit to 16-bit single supply, differential \ninput ADCs. The differential output allows for twice the \nsignal swing in low voltage systems when compared to \nsingle-ended output amplifiers. The balanced differential \nnature of the amplifier also provides even-order harmonic \ndistortion cancellation, and less susceptibility to common mode noise (like power supply noise). The LTC6405 can be \nused as a single  ended input  to differential  output  amplifier , \nor as a differential input to differential output amplifier.\nThe LTC6405 output common mode voltage, defined as \nthe average of the two output voltages, is independent of \nthe \ninput common mode voltage, and is adjusted by apply-\ning a voltage on the V OCM pin. If the pin is left open, there \nis an internal resistive voltage divider, which develops a \npotential of 2.5V (if the supply is 5V). It is recommended \nthat a high quality ceramic cap is used to bypass the V OCM \npin to a low impedance ground plane. The LTC6405’s \ninternal common mode feedback path forces accurate \noutput phase balancing to reduce even order harmonics, \nand centers each individual output about the potential set \nby the V OCM pin.\n  VOUTCM =VOCM =V+OUT +V–OUT\n2\nLTC6405\n14\n6405fb\nFor more information www.linear .com/6405applications inForMation\nFigure 2.

They can source or sink up to approximately 60mA of \ncurrent. Each output is designed to directly drive up to 5pF \nto ground. Higher load capacitances should be decoupled \nwith at least 15Ω of series resistance from each output.\nInput Pin Protection\nThe LTC6405 input stage is protected against differential \ninput voltages which exceed 1.4V by two pairs of series \ndiodes connected back to back between +IN and –IN. In \naddition, the input pins have clamping diodes to either \npower supply. If the input pins are over-driven, the current \nshould be limited to under 10mA to prevent damage to the IC. The LTC6405 also has clamping diodes to either power \nsupply on the V OCM, VTIP and SHDN pins and if driven to \nvoltages which exceed either supply, they too, should be \ncurrent limited to under 10mA.\nSHDN Pin\nThe SHDN pin is a CMOS logic input with a 50k internal \npull-up resistor. If the pin is driven low, the LTC6405 pow-\ners down with Hi-Z outputs. If the pin is left unconnected \nor driven high, the part is in normal active operation. \nSome \ncare should be taken to control leakage currents \nat this pin to prevent inadvertently putting the LTC6405 \ninto shutdown. The turn-on and turn-off time between the \nshutdown and active states are typically less than 1µs.\nLTC6405\n15\n6405fb\nFor more information www.linear .com/6405applications inForMation\nGeneral Amplifier Applications\nAs levels of integration have increased and correspond-\ningly, system supply voltages decreased, there has been \na need for ADCs to process signals differentially in order \nto maintain good signal to noise ratios. These ADCs are \ntypically supplied from a single supply voltage which \ncan be as low as 3V, and will have an optimal common \nmode input range of 1.25V or 1.5V. The LTC6405 makes interfacing to these ADCs easy, by providing both single-\nended to differential conversion as well as common mode \nlevel shifting. The gain to V\nOUTDIFF  from V INM and V INP is:\n  VOUTDIFF =V+OUT– V–OUT ≈RF\nRI•VINP– VINM ( )\nNote from the above equation, the differential output volt-\nage (V +OUT – V –OUT) is completely independent of input \nand output common mode voltages, or the voltage at the \ncommon mode pin. This makes the LTC6405 ideally suited \nfor pre-amplification, level  shifting  and conversion  of single  \nended signals to differential output signals in preparation \nfor driving differential input ADCs.∆\nEffects of Resistor Pair Mismatch\nFigure 3 shows a circuit diagram which takes into consid-\neration that real world resistors will not match perfectly. \nAssuming infinite open loop gain, the differential output \nrelationship is given by the equation:\n   VOUTDIFF =V+OUT– V–OUT ≅RF\nRI•VINDIFF +\n∆b\nbAVG•VICM–∆b\nbAVG•VOCM\nwhere:R\nF is the average of R F1, and R F2, and R I is the average \nof R I1, and R I2.\nbAVG is defined as the average feedback factor from the \noutputs to their respective inputs:\n  bAVG =1\n2•RI1\nRI1+RF1+RI2\nRI2+RF2\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7∆b is defined as the difference in feedback factors:\n   ∆b =RI2\nRI2+RF2–RI1\nRI1+RF1\nVICM is defined  as the average  of the two input  voltages  VINP \nand V INM (also called the input common mode voltage):\n  VICM =1\n2•VINP +VINM ( )\nand V INDIFF  is defined as the difference of the input voltages:\n VINDIFF  = V INP – V INM\nVOCM is defined as the average of the two output voltages \nV+OUT and V –OUT:\n  VOCM =V+OUT +V−OUT\n2\nWhen the feedback ratios mismatch (∆b), common mode \nto differential conversion occurs.\nSetting the differential input to zero (V INDIFF  = 0), the de-\ngree of common mode to differential conversion is given \nby the equation:\n   VOUTDIFF =V+OUT– V–OUT ≈VICM– VOCM ( ) •∆b\nbAVG\nFigure 3.

Using 1% resistors or better will mitigate  \nmost problems, and will provide about 34dB worst case of \ncommon mode rejection. Using 0.1% resistors will provide  \nabout 54dB of common mode rejection. A low impedance \nground plane should be used as a reference for both the \ninput signal source and the V OCM pin. Bypassing the V OCM \nwith a high quality 0.1µF ceramic capacitor to this ground \nplane will further help prevent common mode signals from \nbeing converted to differential signals.\nThere may be concern on how feedback factor mismatch \naffects distortion. Feedback factor mismatch from using \n1% resistors or better, has a negligible effect on distortion. \nHowever, in single supply level shifting applications where \nthere is a voltage difference between the input common \nmode voltage and the output common mode voltage, \nresistor mismatch can make the apparent voltage offset of the amplifier appear worse than specified.\nThe apparent input referred offset induced by feedback \nfactor mismatch is derived from the above equation:\n VOSDIFF(APPARENT)  ≈ (V ICM – V OCM) • ∆b\nUsing the LTC6405 in a single supply application on a  \nsingle\n 5V supply with 1% resistors, and the input common \nmode grounded, with the V OCM pin biased at 2.5V, the \nworst case DC offset can induce 25mV of apparent offset \nvoltage. With 0.1% resistors, the worst case apparent \noffset reduces to 2.5mV.\nInput Impedance and Loading Effects\nThe input impedance looking into the V INP or V INM input \nof Figure 1 depends on whether or not the sources V INP \nand V INM are fully differential or not. For balanced input \nsources (V INP = –V INM), the input impedance seen at either \ninput is simply:\n RINP = R INM = R I\nFor single ended inputs, because of the signal imbalance \nat the input, the input impedance actually increases over the balanced differential case. The input impedance looking  \ninto either input is:\n  RINP =RINM =RI\n1–1\n2•RF\nRI+RF\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nInput signal sources with non-zero output impedances can \nalso cause feedback imbalance between the pair of feedback  \nnetworks. For the best performance, it is recommended \nthat the input source output impedance be compensated \nfor. If input impedance matching is required by the source, \na termination resistor R1 should be chosen (see Figure 4):\n  R1=RINM•RS\nRINM– RS\nAccording to Figure 4, the input impedance looking into \nFigure 4.

At the inputs to the actual op amp, the range extends  \nfrom V– to V+. This makes it easy to interface to a wide \nrange of common mode signals, from ground referenced to \nVCC referenced signals. Moreover, due to external resistive  \ndivider action of the gain and feedback resistors, the effective  \nrange of signals that can be processed is even wider. The  \ninput common mode range at the op amp inputs depends  \non the circuit configuration ( gain), VOCM and V CM (refer to \nFigure 5).

When  \nthe input common mode voltage is near V+, the NPNs are \nactive while the PNPs are off. When the input common \nmode is near V–, the PNPs are active while the NPNs are \noff. At some range in the middle, both input stages are \nactive. This ‘hand-off’ operation happens automatically.\nIn the QFN package, a special pin, V TIP, is made available \nthat can be used to manipulate the ‘hand-off’ operation \nbetween the NPN and PNP input stages. By default, the \nVTIP pin is internally biased by an internal resistive divider \nbetween the supplies, developing a default 2.8V voltage \nwith a 5V supply. If desired, V TIP can be over-driven by \nan external voltage (the Thevenin equivalent resistance is \napproximately 17k).If V\nTIP is pulled closer to V–, the range over which the NPN \ninput pair remains active is increased, while the range over \nwhich the PNP input pair is active is reduced. In applica-\ntions  where the input common mode does not come close \nto \nV– , this mode can be used to further improve linearity \nbeyond the specified performance (see Figure 6).If V\nTIP is pulled closer to V+, the range over which the PNP \ninput pair remains active is increased, while the range over \nwhich the NPN input pair is active is reduced. In applica-\ntions where the input common mode does not come close \nto V+, this mode can be used to further improve linearity \nbeyond the specified performance.\nWith single ended inputs, there is an input signal compo-\nnent to the input common mode voltage. Applying only \nVINP (setting V INM to zero), the input common voltage is \napproximately:\n  VICM =V+IN+V–IN\n2≈VOCM•RI\nRI+RF\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7+\nVCM•RF\nRF+RI\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7+VINP\n2•RF\nRF+RI\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nUse the equations above to check that the V ICM at the op \namp inputs is within range (V– to V+).Figure 6.

The V OCM voltage is internally \nset by a resistive divider between the supplies, developing \na default voltage potential of 2.5V with a 5V supply.In single supply applications, where the LTC6405 is used \nto interface to an ADC, the optimal common mode input \nrange to the ADC is often determined by the ADC’s refer-\nence. If the ADC makes a reference available for setting the \ninput common mode voltage, it can be directly tied to the \nV\nOCM pin (as long as it is able to drive the 19kΩ Thevenin \nequivalent input impedance presented by the V OCM pin).\nThe V OCM pin should be bypassed with a high quality \nceramic bypass capacitor of at least 0.01µF to filter any \ncommon mode noise rather than being converted to dif-\nferential noise and to prevent common mode signals on \nthis pin from being inadvertently converted to differential \nsignals by impedance mismatches both externally and \ninternally to the IC.applications inForMation\nOutput Filter Considerations and Use\nFiltering at the  output of the LTC6405 is often desired to \nprovide \nanti-aliasing or to improve signal to noise ratio. \nTo simplify this filtering, the LTC6405 in the QFN package \nincludes an additional pair of differential outputs (+OUTF \nand –OUTF) which incorporate an internal lowpass RC \nnetwork with a –3dB bandwidth of 850MHz (Figure 7).These pins each have an output resistance of 50Ω (toler-\nance ±12%). Internal capacitances are 1.25pF (tolerance \n±15%) to V\n– on each filtered output, plus an additional \n1.25pF ( tolerance ±15%) capacitor connected between the \ntwo filtered outputs. This resistor/capacitor combination creates filtered outputs that look like a series 50Ω resistor \nwith a 3.75pF capacitor shunting each filtered output to AC ground, providing a –3dB bandwidth of 850MHz, and \na noise bandwidth of 1335MHz. The filter cutoff frequency is easily modified with just a few external components. To \nincrease the cutoff frequency, simply add two equal value \nresistors, one between +OUT and +OUTF and the other \nbetween –OUT and –OUTF (Figure 8). These resistors, in \nparallel with the internal 50Ω resistors, lower the overall \nresistance and therefore increase filter bandwidth. For \nexample, to double the filter bandwidth, add two external \n50Ω resistors to lower the series filter resistance to 25Ω. \nThe 3.75pF of capacitance \n remains unchanged, so filter \nbandwidth doubles. Keep in mind, the series resistance \nalso serves to decouple the outputs from load capaci-\nFigure 7.

The outputs of the LTC6405 are designed to drive \n5pF to ground, so care should be taken to not lower the \neffective impedance between +OUT and +OUTF or –OUT \nand –OUTF below 15Ω.\nTo decrease filter bandwidth, add two external capacitors, \none from +OUTF to ground, and the other from –OUTF to \nground. A single differential capacitor connected between \n+OUTF and –OUTF can also be used, but since it is being \ndriven differentially it will appear at each filtered output \nas a single-ended capacitance of twice the value. To halve \nthe filter bandwidth, for example, two 3.9pF capacitors \ncould be added (one from each filtered output to ground). Alternatively, one 1.8pF capacitor could be added between \nthe filtered outputs, which also halves the filter bandwidth. \nCombinations of capacitors could be used as well; a three \ncapacitor solution of 1.2pF from each filtered output to \nground plus a 1.2pF capacitor between the filtered outputs \nwould also halve the filter bandwidth (Figure 9).\nNoise Considerations\nThe LTC6405’s input referred voltage noise is 1.6nV/√ Hz. \nIts input referred current noise is 2.4pA/√ Hz. In addition \nto the noise generated by the amplifier, the surrounding \nfeedback resistors  also contribute noise. A noise model is \nshown \nin Figure 10.

When the feedback \nnetwork is comprised of resistors whose values are less \nthan this, the LTC6405’s output noise is voltage noise \ndominant (see Figure 11):\n  eno ≈eni•1+RF\nRI\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nFeedback networks consisting of resistors with values \ngreater than about 200Ω will result in output noise which \nis resistor noise and amplifier current noise dominant.\n  eno ≈2•In•RF ( )2+1+RF\nRI\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7•4•k•T•RF\nLower resistor values (<100Ω) always result in lower noise  \nat the penalty of increased distortion due to increased \nloading of the feedback network on the output. Higher \nresistor values (but still less than <500Ω) will result in \nhigher output noise, but typically improved distortion due \nto less loading on the output. The optimal feedback resis-\ntance for the LTC6405 runs in between 100Ω to 500Ω.\nThe differential filtered outputs +OUTF and –OUTF will \nhave a little higher noise than the unfiltered outputs (due \nto the two 50Ω resistors which contribute 0.9nV/√ Hz \neach), but can provide superior signal-to-noise due to the \noutput noise filtering.\nLayout Considerations\nBecause the LTC6405 is a very high speed amplifier, it is \nsensitive to both stray capacitance and stray inductance. \nIn the QFN package, three pairs of power supply pins are \nprovided to keep the power supply inductance as low \nas possible to prevent any degradation of amplifier 2nd \nharmonic performance. It is critical that close attention be \npaid to supply bypassing. For single supply applications \nit is recommended that high quality 0.1µF surface mount \nceramic bypass capacitor be placed directly between each \nV+ and V– pin with direct short connections. The V– pins \nshould be tied  directly to a low impedance ground plane \nwith \nminimal routing. For dual (split) power supplies, it is recommended that additional high quality, 0.1µF ceramic \ncapacitors are used to bypass V+ to ground and V– to \nground, again with minimal routing. For driving large \nloads (<200Ω), additional bypass capacitance may be \nneeded for optimal performance. Keep in mind that small \ngeometry (e.g., 0603) surface mount ceramic capacitors have a much higher self resonant frequency than do leaded  \ncapacitors, and perform best in high speed applications.\nAny stray parasitic capacitances to ground at the summing  \njunctions, +IN and – IN, should be minimized. This becomes  \nespecially true when the feedback resistor network uses \nresistor values >500Ω in circuits with R\nF = RI. Always keep \nin mind the differential nature of the LTC6405, and that it is critical that the load impedances seen by both outputs \n(stray or intended), should be as balanced and symmetric \nas possible. This will help preserve the natural balance \nof the LTC6405, which minimizes the generation of even \norder harmonics, and improves the rejection of common mode signals and noise.\nIt is highly recommended that the V\nOCM pin be bypassed \nto ground with a high quality ceramic capacitor  whose \nvalue exceeds 0.01µF. This will help stabilize the common \nmode feedback loop as well as prevent thermal noise from \nthe internal voltage divider and other external sources of \nnoise from being converted to differential noise due to \ndivider mismatches in the feedback networks. It is also \nrecommended that the resistive feedback networks be \ncomprised of 1% resistors (or better) to enhance the \noutput common mode rejection. This will also prevent \nVOCM input referred common mode noise of the common \nmode amplifier path (which cannot be filtered) from being \nconverted to differential noise, degrading the differential noise performance.\nFeedback factor mismatch has a weak effect on distortion. \nUsing 1% or better resistors will limit any mismatch from \nimpacting amplifier linearity. However, in single supply \nlevel shifting applications where there is a voltage differ-\nence between the input common mode voltage and the \noutput common mode voltage, resistor mismatch can \nmake the apparent voltage offset of the amplifier appear \nworse than specified.\nLTC6405\n21\n6405fb\nFor more information www.linear .com/6405Interfacing the LTC6405 to A/D Converters\nRail-to-rail input and fast settling time make the LTC6405 \nideal for interfacing to low voltage, single supply, differ-\nential input ADCs. The sampling process of ADCs create \na sampling glitch caused by switching in the sampling \ncapacitor on the ADC front end which momentarily “ shorts” \nthe output of the amplifier as charge is transferred between \nthe amplifier and the sampling capacitor. The amplifier \nmust recover and settle from this load transient before \nthis acquisition period ends for a valid representation of \nthe input signal. In general, the LTC6405 will settle much \nmore quickly from these periodic load impulses than from \na 2V input step, but it is a good idea to place an R-C filter \nnetwork between the differential outputs of the LTC6405 \nand the input of the ADC to help absorb the charge injection  \nthat comes out of the ADC from the sampling process. The capacitance of the filter network serves as a charge \nreservoir to provide high frequency charging during the \nsampling process, while the resistors of the filter network \nare used to dampen and attenuate any charge kickback \nfrom the ADC. The selection of  the R-C time constant is \ntrial \nand error for a given ADC, but the following guidelines \nare recommended: Choosing too large of a resistor in the \ndecoupling network leaving insufficient settling time will \ncreate a voltage divider between the dynamic input imped-\nance of the ADC and the decoupling resistors. Choosing \ntoo small of a resistor will possibly prevent the resistor \nfrom properly dampening the load transient caused by \nthe sampling process, prolonging the time required for \nsettling. In 16-bit applications, this will typically require \na minimum of 11 R-C time constants. It is recommended \nthat the capacitor chosen have a high quality dielectric \n(such as C0G multilayer ceramic).applications inForMation\nFigure 12.
