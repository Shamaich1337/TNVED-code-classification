The HI-8596 \nrequires only a single +3.3V power supply. An integrated \ninverting / non-inverting voltage doubler generates the \nrail voltages  (±6.6V) which are then used to produce the \n±5V ARINC-429 output levels. \nThe internal dual polarity charge pump circuit requires \nfour external capacitors, two for each polarity gener -\nated by the doubler. CP+ and CP- connect the exter -\nnal charge transfer or “fly” capacitor, CFLY, to the positive \nportion of the doubler, resulting in twice VDD at the VDD2+ \npin. An output “hold” capacitor, COUT, is placed between \nVDD2+ and GND. COUT should be ten times the size of CFLY. \nThe inverting or negative portion of the converter works \nin a similar fashion, with CFLY and COUT placed between \nCN+ / CN- and VDD2- / GND respectively. \nCurrents for slope control are set by on-chip resistors.\nThe TX0IN and TX1IN inputs receive logic signals \nfrom a  control transmitter chip such as the HI-3584.  \nTXAOUT and TXBOUT hold each side of the ARINC bus \nat Ground until one of the inputs becomes a One.  If for \nexample TX1IN goes high, a charging path is enabled to 5V on an “A” side internal capacitor while the “B” side is \nenabled to -5V.  The charging current is selected by the \nSLP pin.  If the SLP pin is high, the capacitor is nominally \ncharged from 10% to 90% in 1.5μs.  If SLP is low, the \nrise and fall times are 10μs.\nA unity gain buffer receives the internally generated \nslopes and differentially drives the ARINC line. Cur -\nrent is limited by the series output resistors at each pin.  \nThere are no fuses at the outputs of the HI-8596.\nThe HI-8596 has 37.5 ohms in series with each TXOUT \noutput and 5 ohms in series with each AMP output.  The \nAMP outputs are for applications where external series \nresistance is required, typically for lightning protection \ndevices. Holt Application Note AN-300 describes suit -\nable lightning protection schemes.\nTri-stateable outputs allow multiple line drivers to be \nconnected to the same ARINC 429 bus. Setting TX1IN \nand TX0IN both to a logic “1” puts the outputs in the \nhigh-impedance state.\nABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS \nSupply Voltages\nVDD .......................................................... +5V\nPower Dissipation at 25oC\nplastic SOIC ........... 1.0W, derate 10mW/oC\nceramic DIP ......... 0.5W, derate 7mW/oC\nSolder Temperature ......................... 275oC for 10sec\nStorage Temperature ....................... -65oC to +150oC\nNote: HEAT SINK on QFN PACKAGE\nThe HI-8596 driver is available in a small-footprint, thermally \nenhanced QFN (chip-scale) package.
