TYPICAL APPLICATION CIRCUIT  \n \n  \n\nEverest Semiconductor  Confidential  ES8316  \nRevision 12.0 5 February  2022 \nLatest datasheet: www.everest -semi.com  or info@everest -semi.com  4. CLOCK MODES AND SAMP LING FREQUENCIES  \nThe device supports two  types of clocking: standard audio clocks (256Fs, 384Fs, 512Fs, etc), and \nUSB clocks (12/24 MHz).  \nAccording to the serial audio data sampling frequency  (Fs), the device can work in two speed \nmodes : single speed mode or double speed mode. In single speed mode, Fs normally ranges \nfrom 8 kHz to 48 kHz, and in double speed mode, Fs normally range from 64 kHz to 96 kHz.  \nThe device can work either in master clock mode or slave clock mode. In slave mode, LRCK and \nSCLK are supplied externally, and LRCK and SCLK must be synchronously derived from the system clock with specific rates. In master mode, LRCK and SCLK are derived internally from \ndevic e master clock.  \n5. MICRO -CONTROLLER CONFIGURA TION INTERFACE  \nThe device supports standard I2C micro -controller configuration interface. External micro -\ncontroller can completely configure the device through writing to in ternal configuration \nregisters.  \nI2C inter face is a bi -directional serial bus that uses a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line \n(SCL) for data transfer. The timing diagram for data transfer of this interface is given in Figure 1 . \nData are transmitted synchronously to SCL clock on the SDA line on a byte-by -byte basis. Each \nbit in a byte is sampled during SCL high with MSB bit being transmitted firstly. Each transferred \nbyte is followed by an acknowledge bit from receiver to pull the SDA low. The transfer rate of this interface can be up to 400 kbps.  \n \nFigure 1 Data Transfer for I\n2C Interface  \nA master controller initiates the transmission by sending a “start” signal, which is defined as a high -to-low transition at SDA while SCL is high. The first byte transferred is the slave address. It \nis a seven-bit chip address followed by a RW bit. The chip address must be 0010 00x, where x \nequals AD0 . The RW bit indicates the slave data transfer direction. Once an acknowledge bit is \nreceived, the data transfer starts to proceed on a byte -by-byte basis in the direction specified by \nthe RW bit. The master can terminate the communication by generating a “stop” signal, which is defined as a low -to-high transition at SDA while SCL is high.  \n\nEverest Semiconductor  Confidential  ES8316  \nRevision 12.0 6 February  2022 \nLatest datasheet: www.everest -semi.com  or info@everest -semi.com  In I2C interface mode, the registers can be written and read. The format s of “write” and “read” \ninstructions are shown in Table 1  and Table 2. Please note that, to read data from a register, you \nmust set R/W bit to 0 to access the register address and then set R/W to 1 to read data from the \nregister.  \nTable 1 Write Data to Regi ster in I2C Interface Mode  \nChip Address  R/W   Register Address   Data to be written  \n001000  AD0  0 ACK RAM  ACK DATA  \n \nTable 2 Read Data from Register in I2C Interface Mode  \nChip Address  R/W   Register Address  \n001000  AD0  0 ACK RAM  \nChip Address  R/W   Data to be read  \n001000  AD0  1 ACK Data  \n6. DIGITAL AUDIO INTERFACE  \nThe device provides many formats of serial audio data interface to the input of the DAC or \noutput from the ADC through LRCK, B CLK (SCLK) and DACDAT/ADCDAT  pins. These formats are \nI2S, left  justified, DSP/PCM and TDM mode. DAC input DACDAT  is sampled by the device  on the \nrising  edge of SCLK. ADC data is out at  ADCDAT  on the falling edge of SCLK.  The relationship of \nSDATA (DACDAT/ADCDAT ), SCLK and LRCK with these formats are  shown through Figure 2 to \nFigure 6. \nn-2 n-1 n 3 2 11 SCLK\nMSB LSB\nLEFT CHANNELn-2 n-1 n 3 2 11 SCLK\nMSB LSB\nRIGHT CHANNELSDATA\nSCLK\nLRCK\n \nFigure 2 I2S Serial Audio Data Format Up To 24 -bit \nn-2 n-1 n 3 2 1\nMSB LSB\nLEFT CHANNELn-2 n-1 n 3 2 1\nMSB LSB\nRIGHT CHANNELSDATA\nSCLK\nLRCK\n \nFigure 3 Left Justified Serial Audio Data Format Up To 24 -bit \nEverest Semiconductor  Confidential  ES8316  \nRevision 12.0 7 February  2022 \nLatest datasheet: www.everest -semi.com  or info@everest -semi.com   \nFigure 5 DSP/PCM Mode A  \n \nFigure 6 DSP/PCM Mode B  \n7.
