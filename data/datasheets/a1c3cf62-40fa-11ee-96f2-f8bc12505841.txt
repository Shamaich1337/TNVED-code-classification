This allows \nthe Ag5300 to be compatible with power sourcing equipment that uses  the different power \noptions (power on the Data Pair or power  on the Spare Pair);  see Figure 3.   \n  \n \n \nFigure 3: Typical System Diagram \n \n*Note: Suitable bridge rectifier for BR1 & BR2 would be a “DF01S” or equivalent. \n  \n5.2 PD Signature \n When the Ag5300 is connected to the Cat 5e cable, it will automatically present a Powered Device (PD) signature to the PSE, when request ed. The PSE will recogni se that a PD is \nconnected to that line and supply power.     \nV1.2 February 2015 \nData Sheet Ag5300  \nPower-over-Ethernet Plus Module\n \n© Silver Telecom 2015 6 5.3 Isolation \n \nTo meet the safety isolation requirements of  IEEE802.3at section 33. 4.1. A PD must pass \nthe electrical strength test of  IEC 60950-1:2001 sub cl ause 6.2.1. This calls for either a) \n1500Vac test or b) 2250Vdc te st or c) 1500Vdc impulse test. The Ag5300 has been \ndesigned to meet c) 1500Vdc impulse test.  \n5.4 Power Classification  \n The Ag5300 classification is fixed at Class 4, this means that an IEEE8 02.3at Type 1 or an \nIEEE802.3af PSE will default to Class 0. Howe ver an IEEE802.3at PSE will recognise the \nClass 4 as a Type 2 PD.  \n5.5 AT Detection \n The Ag5300 has an AT-DET output pin which is used to detect a Two Event Physical Layer classification as described in IEEE 802.3at. If required the AT-DET pin can be \nconnected directly to an opto-coupler as shown in Figure 4.  \n \n \nFigure 4: Two Event Physical Layer Detect Configuration \n If the Ag5300 detects a Two Event Physical Layer classification, the (AT True) switch will close and Opto1 will turn ON. Opto1 will pass this signal acro ss the isolation barrier and \nthe output collector can be connected to a controller (with a pu ll-up resistor connected to \nthe controller’s power rail). When Opto1 is ON  the collector (output) will be Logic 0, the \ncontroller will then know that the PSE is capable of delivering over 15.4W. To complete the \nV1.2 February 2015 \nData Sheet Ag5300  \nPower-over-Ethernet Plus Module\n \n© Silver Telecom 2015 7 protocol (and conform to the IEEE802.3at specif ication) the controller should then confirm \nthat it is a Type 2 PD ov er the Data Link Layer*. \n \nIf the Ag5300 detects a Single Event Physical Layer classification, Op to1 will be OFF and \nthe output collector will be Logic 1 (via pull-up resistor). The controller should then assume \nthat the PSE is limited to onl y delivering up to 15.4W.  \n If the PSE does not support the Physical Laye r classification, Opto1 will be OFF. \n The Ag5300 will operate with non IEEE 802.3at compliant POE+ PSE’s. \n \n*Note: There are several PSEs (including Cisco) that will only delivery ≤ 15.4W until they \nreceive Type 2 PD confirmation, over the Data Link Layer. \n \n \n5.6 DC/DC Converter \n The Ag5300’s DC/DC converter pr ovides a regulated 12V (nomin al) output with low ripple \nand low noise.   The DC/DC converter circuit also has built-in output overload and short-circuit protection.  \n In addition to the overload and short-circui t protection; the Ag5300 has built-in thermal \nprotection circuit. This circuit will shutdown t he DC/DC converter if the maximum operating \ntemperature is exceeded.              \n \n         \nV1.2 February 2015 \nData Sheet Ag5300  \nPower-over-Ethernet Plus Module\n \n© Silver Telecom 2015 8 5.7 Output Adjustment \n \nThe Ag5300 has an ADJ pin, which allows the output voltage to be increased or decreased \nfrom its nominal value.

Setting the output voltage \nbelow this level may result in the module being permanently damaged. \nV1.2 February 2015 \nData Sheet Ag5300  \nPower-over-Ethernet Plus Module\n \n© Silver Telecom 2015 9 5.8 Typical Connections \n \nThe Ag5300 only requires a few external co mponents - the bridge re ctifiers on the VIN \ninput are to conform to the IEEE802.3at input  polarity protection requirement. The 470µF \ncapacitor (C1) connected across the output is  needed for stability and to cope with load \nstep changes. This capacitor must  be positioned as close to the output pins as possible. It \ncan be a low cost electrolyt ic capacitor (a minimum of 470µF 16V is recommended) as \nshown in Figure 6 ; it does not need to be a low ESR type for operat ion in temperatures \ndown to 0 °C.  But if ambient temperature is likely to go below 0 °C then we would \nrecommend a low ESR elec trolytic capacitor.  \n The output voltage can be adjust ed by simply connecting a resi stor between the ADJ pin \nand either the +VDC Pin or t he –VDC pin, see section 5.7 Output Adjustment . \n \n \nFigure 6: Typical PoE Only Connection Diagram \n \n \nV1.2 February 2015 \nData Sheet Ag5300  \nPower-over-Ethernet Plus Module\n \n© Silver Telecom 2015 10 5.9 Minimum Load \n \nThe Ag5300 must always supply the minimum load current, see Table 11.3.   When operated below this current, the Ag5300 c an emit a low level audible noise and may \ncause some PSEs to fail the Maintain Power Si gnature (MPS) and switch its output off.  \n The reason that the module em its this noise is due to the dc/dc converter running in \ndiscontinuous mode.  If this audible noise is not an issue, then the Ag5300 can work safely with a much smaller \nload. But to ensure that the PSE has a sufficient load to meet the PSEs MPS, it would be \nadvisable not to operate the Ag5300 bel ow the specified minimum load.  \n  \n5.10 Output Power \n The Ag5300 is capable of del ivering a maximum output power of 24W continuous, with \nshort peak transients of up to 30W. However this  is limited by the available input power \nand operating tem perature.  \n When calculating the output pow er, the following factors must  be taken into account: - \n \n1. Ag5300  efficiency 2. PSE output power (which could be limit ed by the IEEE802.3at specification) \n3. Cable and connector losses 4. Input bridge rectifier losses 5. Operating temperature \n \n6 Typical Application \n The Ag5300 can be used in numerous applications . In the example show n in Figure 7, the \ndata outputs from the switch are connected to the inputs of a midspan. The midspan will \nthen add power (to the data) on eac h output that supports POE. \n In this example port 1 is connected to an et hernet camera and port 2 is connected to a \ndoor entry access unit, both of these devices have a built-in Ag5300. When the midspan is switched on (or when the device is connect ed), the midspan will check each output for a \nPOE signature. On ports 1 and 2 the Ag5300 wi ll identify themselves  as POE enabled \ndevices and the midspan will supply both data and power to these peripherals. \n The other ports (shown in this example) wil l not have a PoE signature and the midspan will \nonly pass the data through to these periphera ls. The midspan will continuously monitor \neach output to see if a POE enabled device has been added or removed.  \nV1.2 February 2015 \nData Sheet Ag5300  \nPower-over-Ethernet Plus Module\n \n© Silver Telecom 2015 11 \n \nFigure 7: Typical Application \n \n7 Layout Consideration \n \nFigure 8 shows an example boar d layout for the Ag5300. \n  \nKeep out area\n(Isolation Barrier)Output\nVoltageTo output of bridge \nrectifiers C1Ag5300\n1To µ-controller\n(AT detection)\n+\n-+-Opto1\n \n \nFigure 8: Layout Consideration \n \n \nV1.2 February 2015 \nData Sheet Ag5300  \nPower-over-Ethernet Plus Module\n \n© Silver Telecom 2015 12 8 Operating Temperature Range \n \nBecause the Ag5300 is a power component, it will g enerate heat; so it is important that this \nbe taken into consideration at the design stage. \n \nThe heart of the Ag5300 is a DC/DC converter, which like any other power supply will generate heat. The amount of heat generated by the module wi ll depend on the load it is \nrequired to drive and the input voltage suppli ed by the PSE. The information shown within \nthis section of datasheet is referenced to a nominal 52Vdc input voltage supplied by the \nPSE.  Because each application is diffe rent it is impossible to give  fixed and absolute thermal \nrecommendations. However to obtain maximum pow er it is important that any enclosure \nused has sufficient ventilation and forced airflow over the Ag5300.  \nWhen intended for used in ambi ent temperatures below 0°C we would recommend a low \nESR electrolytic capacitor be used on the DC output. Capacitors rated for -55 °C operation \nshould be used below 0 °C. \n \nFigure 9 show the maximum ambient temperature under continuous load conditions. The \nAg5300 is capable of handling 30W peak power for short durations, but this will de-rate the \noperating temperature profile shown in Figur e 9. The graph shown has been recorded in \nan Associated Environment System SD-302 cham ber (with circulating air). Operation in a \nsealed enclosure with limited airflow will also result in de-rating of the operating \ntemperature profile.   \n- 2 0 - 1 00 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 028\n410\n6Output Power (W)\nAmbient Temperature (°C)12141618202224\nContinuous\n \nFigure 9: Ag5300 Operating Profile \n \nNote: See Apps Note “ANX-POE-Thermal Consi derations” for suggesti ons on thermal management. \n \nV1.2 February 2015 \nData Sheet Ag5300  \nPower-over-Ethernet Plus Module\n \n© Silver Telecom 2015 13 One simple method to draw some of the heat away from the Ag5300 is shown in Figure \n10. \n Power planes will help draw heat away from the Ag5300. But it is important that these are \non the outer layers of the PCB and the Ag5300 must not be fitted into a socket.  \n \n \nFigure 10: Thermal Relief Power Planes \n   \n9 Protection \n \nThe Ag5300 has built-in over-c urrent and thermal protection to prevent the module from \nbeing damaged if operated beyond its power / temperature specificat ion. If a short circuit is \napplied to the output, the DC/DC converter will limit the current  until the short circuit is \nremoved. If the maximum operating temperatur e is exceeded; the thermal protection circuit \nwill disable the DC/DC converte r until the Ag5300 temperature has cooled sufficiently. \n \n The Ag5300 may be damaged by input  voltage transients greater than 80V. If protection \nfrom electrostatic discharge (ESD) or other high voltage transients is required, it is \nrecommended that an over-voltage clamping dev ice is fitted across the VIN+ and VIN- \ninput pins. Typically an SMAJ58A will be sufficient; see Figure 11.   \nNote: For more information refer to Apps Note “ANX-POE-Protection”. \n \nV1.2 February 2015 \nData Sheet Ag5300  \nPower-over-Ethernet Plus Module\n \n© Silver Telecom 2015 14 Ag5300\nSMAJ58A *VIN+\nVIN-+ -~\n~+ -~\n~\n* Note: Bidirectional Tranzorb diodes are also suitable in this configuration (SMAJ58CA)BR1\nBR2\n \nFigure 11: Input Protection \n10 EMC \n \nThe Ag5300 has been designed to pass EN55022 Class b; however the Ag5300 will only \nbe one component within a system.
