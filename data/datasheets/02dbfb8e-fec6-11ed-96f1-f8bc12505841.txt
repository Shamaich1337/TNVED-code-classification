Benefits from the \nprogrammable drive strength feature are:  \n◼ Improves system radiated electromagnetic interfere nce \n(EMI) by slowing down the clock rise/fall time  \n◼ Improves the downstream clock receiver’s (RX) jitter by \ndecreasing (speeding up) the clock rise/fall time.  \n◼ Ability to drive large capacitive loads while maintaining \nfull swing with sharp edge rates.  \nFor mo re detailed information about rise/fall time control \nand drive strength selection, see the SiTime Application \nNotes se ction . \nEMI Reduction by Slowing Rise/Fall Time  \nFigure 16 shows the harmonic power reduction as the \nrise/fall times are increased (slowed down). The rise/fall \ntimes are expressed as a ratio of the clock period. For the \nratio of 0.05, the signal is ve ry close to a square wave. For \nthe ratio of 0.45, the rise/fall times are very close to near -\ntriangular waveform. These results, for example, show that \nthe 11th clock harmonic can be reduced by 35 dB if the \nrise/fall edge is increased from 5% of the period  to 45% of \nthe period.  \n \n1 3 5 7 9 11-80-70-60-50-40-30-20-10010\nHarmonic numberHarmonic amplitude (dB)\n  trise=0.05\ntrise=0.1\ntrise=0.15\ntrise=0.2\ntrise=0.25\ntrise=0.3\ntrise=0.35\ntrise=0.4\ntrise=0.45\n  \nFigure 16. Harmonic EMI reduction as a Function  \nof Slower Rise/Fall Time  \nJitter Reduction with Faster Rise/Fall Time  \nPower supply noise can be a source of jitter for the \ndownstream chipset. One way to reduce this jitter is to \nspeed up  the rise/fall  time of the input  clock.  Some  chipsets  \nmay also require faster rise/fall time in order to reduce their \nsensitivity to this type of jitter. Refer to the Rise/Fall Time \nTables (Table  7 to Table 11)  to determine the proper drive \nstrength.   \nHigh Output Load Capability  \nThe rise/fall time of the input clock varies as a function of \nthe actual capacitive load the clock drives. At any given \ndrive strength, the rise/fall time becomes slower as the \noutput load increases. As an example, for a 3.3  V SiT1602 \ndevice with default d rive strength setting, the typical rise/fall \ntime is 1  ns for 15  pF output load. The typical rise/fall time \nslows down to 2.6 ns when the output load increases to \n45 pF. One can choose to speed up the rise/fall time to \n1.83 ns by then increasing  the drive  strength  setting  on \nthe SiT1602.  \nThe SiT1602 can support up to 60  pF or higher in \nmaximum  capacitive loads with drive strength settings. \nRefer to the Rise/Fall Time Tables (Table 7 to 11)  to \ndetermine the proper drive strength for the desired \ncombination of output load vs. rise/fall time.  \nSiT1602  Drive Strength Selection  \nTables 7 through 11  define the rise/fall time for a given \ncapacitive load and supply voltage.  \n1. Select the table that matches the SiT1602 nominal \nsupply voltage (1.8  V, 2.5  V, 2.8  V, 3.0  V, 3.3  V). \n2. Select the capacitive load column that matches the \napplication requirement (5 pF to 60 pF)  \n3. Under the capacitive load column, select the desired \nrise/fall times.  \n4. The left -most column represents the  part number code \nfor the corresponding drive strength.  \n5. Add the drive strength code to the part number for \nordering purposes.  \nCalculating Maximum Frequency  \nAny given rise/fall time in Table 7 through 11  dictates the \nmaximum frequency under which the oscillator can operate \nwith guaranteed full output swing over the entire operating \ntemperature range. This max frequency can be calculated \nas the following:  \n=1\n5 x Trf_20/80Max Frequency\n \nwhere Trf_20/80 is the typical value for 20% -80% \nrise/fall time.  \nExample 1  \nCalculate f MAX for the following condition:  \n◼ Vdd = 1.8  V (Table 7) \n◼ Capacitive Lo ad: 30 pF  \n◼ Desired Tr/f time = 3 ns  (rise/fall time part number \ncode = E)  \n◼ fMAX = 66.666660  \nPart number for the above example:  \n \nDrive strength code is inserted here.

These  modes  can also be programmed  \nwith the Time Machine using field programmable  devices.  \nOutput Enable (OE)  Mode  \nIn the OE mode, applying logic Low to the OE pin only \ndisables the output driver and puts it in Hi -Z mode. The \ncore of the device continues to operate normally. Power \nconsumption is reduced due to the inactivity of the output. \nWhen the OE pin is pulled Hig h, the output is typically \nenab led in <1 µs.  \nStandby ( ST,  ̅  ̅ ̅  ) Mode  \n \nIn the ST,  ̅  ̅ ̅   mode, a device enters into the standby mode \nwhen Pin 1 pulled Low. All internal circuits of the device are \nturned off.  The current  is reduced  to a standby  current,  \ntypically  in the range of a few µA. When ST,  ̅  ̅ ̅   is pulled \nHigh, the device goes through  the “resume”  process,  which  \ncan take up to 5 ms. \nNo Connect (NC) Mode  \nIn the NC mode, the device always operates in its normal \nmode and outputs the specified frequency regardless of \nthe logic level on pin 1.  \nTable 12 below summarizes the key relevant parameters in \nthe operation of the device in  OE, ST,  ̅  ̅ ̅  , or NC  mode.  \nTable 12.
