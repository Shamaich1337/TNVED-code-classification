GENERAL DESCRIPTION S \nThe W25Q128JV  (128M -bit) Serial Flash memory provides a storage solution for systems with limited \nspace, pins and power. The 25Q series offers  flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash \ndevices. They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM,  executing code directly from D ual/Quad SPI  (XIP)  \nand storing voice, text and data. The device operates on a single 2.7V to 3.6V power supply w ith current \nconsumption as low as 1µA for power -down. All devices are offered in space -saving packages.  \nThe W25Q128JV  array is organized into 65,536 programmable pages of 256 -bytes each. Up to 256 bytes \ncan be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in g roups of 16 (4KB sector erase), groups of 128 \n(32KB block erase), groups of 256 (64KB block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The W25Q128JV  \nhas 4,096 erasable sectors and 256 erasable blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for greater \nflexibility in applications that require data and parameter storage. (See Figure 2.)  \nThe W25Q128JV  support s the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Dual/Quad I/O SPI: Serial \nClock, Chip Select, Serial Data I/O0 (DI), I/O1 (DO), I/O2 and I/O3. SPI clock  frequencies  of W 25Q128JV  \nof up to 133MHz  are supported allowing equivalent clock rates of 266MHz ( 133MHz  x 2) for Dual I/O and \n532MHz ( 133MHz  x 4) for Quad I/O when using the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O. These transfer rates can \noutperform standard Asynchrono us 8 and 16 -bit Parallel Flash memories.  \nAdditionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device ID  and SFDP , and a 64-bit \nUnique Serial Number and three 256 -bytes Security Registers.  \n \n2.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \n4.1 Chip Select (/CS)  \nThe SPI Chip Select (/CS) pin enables and disables device operation. When /CS  is high the device is \ndeselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3) pins are at high impedance. When \ndeselected, the devices power consumption will be at standb y levels unless an internal erase, program or \nwrite status register cycle is in progress. When /CS  is brought low the device will be selected, power \nconsumption will increase to active levels and instructions can be written to and data read from the device . \nAfter power -up, /CS  must transition from high to low before a new instruction will be accepted. The /CS \ninput must track the VCC supply level at power -up and power -down (see “Write Protection” and Figure \n58). If needed a pull-up resister on the /CS pin can be used to accomplish this.  \n4.2 Serial Data Input, Output and IOs (DI, DO and IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3)   \nThe W25 Q128JV  supports standard SPI, Dual SPI and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI instructions \nuse the unidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instru ctions, addresses or data to the device on the \nrising edge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidirectional DO (output) to \nread data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \nDual and Quad SPI instructions use the  bidirectional IO pins to serially write instructions, addresses or \ndata to the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the device on the falling edge of \nCLK. Quad SPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Stat us Register -2 to be set. \nWhen QE=1, the /WP pin becomes IO2 and the /HOLD pin becomes IO3.  \n4.3  Write Protect (/WP)  \nThe Write Protect (/WP) pin can be used to prevent the Status Register from being written. Used in \nconjunction with the Status Register’s Block  Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0) bits and Status \nRegister Protect (SRP) bits, a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire memory array can be \nhardware protected. The /WP pin is active low.  \n4.4 HOLD (/HOLD)  \nThe /HOLD pin allows the device to be p aused while it is actively selected. When /HOLD is brought low, \nwhile /CS is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals on the DI and CLK pins will be ignored \n(don’t care). When /HOLD is brought high, device operation can resume. The /HOLD funct ion can be \nuseful when multiple devices are sharing the same SPI signals. The /HOLD pin is active low. When the \nQE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, the /HOLD pin function is not available since this pin is \nused for IO3. See Figure 1a -c for the  pin configuration of Quad I/O operation.  \n \n4.5 Serial Clock (CLK)  \nThe SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and output operations. ("See SPI \nOperations")  \n4.6 Reset (/RESET)  \nA dedicated hardware /RESET pin is available on SOIC -16 and  TFBGA packages. When it’s driven low for \na minimum period of ~1µS, this device will terminate any external or internal operations and return to its  \npower -on state.  \n \nNote: Hardware /RESET pin is available on SOIC -16 or TFBGA; please contact Winbond for thi s package.  \nW25Q128JV  \n \nPublication Release Date:  August 23 , 2021  \n- 10 -                                 Revision I 5.

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ONS \n6.1  Standard SPI Instructions  \nThe W 25Q128JV  is accessed through an SPI com patible bus consisting of four signals: Serial Clock \n(CLK), Chip Select (/CS), Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard SPI instructions \nuse the DI input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of \nCLK. The DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 and \nMode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signa l when the SPI bus master is in standby and data is \nnot being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0, the CLK signal is normally low on the falling and \nrising edges of /CS. For Mode 3, the CLK signal is normally high on the falling and rising edges of  /CS.  \n6.2 Dual SPI Instructions  \nThe W 25Q128JV  supports Dual SPI operation when using instructions such as “Fast Read Dual Output \n(3Bh)” and “Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh)”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the \ndevice at two to three time s the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices. The Dual SPI Read instructions are \nideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -shadowing) or for executing non -speed -\ncritical code directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Dual SPI instructi ons, the DI and DO pins \nbecome bidirectional I/O pins: IO0 and IO1.  \n6.3 Quad SPI Instructions  \nThe W 25Q128JV  supports Quad  SPI operation when using instructions such as “Fast Read Quad  Output \n(6Bh)”,  and “Fast Read Quad  I/O (EBh). These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the \ndevice four to six times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash. When using Quad SPI instructions, the DI and \nDO pins become bidirectional IO0 and IO1, with the additional I/O pins: IO2, IO3.  \n6.4 Software Reset & Hardware /RESET pin  \nThe W25Q 128JV  can be reset to the initial power -on state by a software Reset se quence. This sequence \nmust  include two consecutive instruction s: Enable Reset (66h) & Reset (99h). If the instruction  sequence \nis successfully accepted, the device will take ap proximately 30 µS (tRST) to reset. No instruction  will be \naccepted during the reset period.  For the SOIC -16 and TFBGA package s, W25Q 128JV  provides a \ndedicated hardware /RESET pin. Drive the /RESET pin low for a minimum period of ~ 1µS (tRESET*) will \ninterrup t any on -going external/internal operations  and reset the device to its initial power -on state. \nHardware /RESET pin has high er priority than other SPI input signals  (/CS, CLK, IOs).  \n \nNote:  \n1. Hardware /RESET pin is available on SOIC -16 or TFBGA; please conta ct Winbond for his package.  \n2. While a faster /RESET pulse (as short as a few hundred nanoseconds) will often reset the device, a 1us minimum is \nrecommended to ensure reliable operation.  \n3. There is an internal pull -up resistor for the dedicated /RESET pin on th e SOIC -16 and TFBGA -24 package. If the reset function \nis not needed, this pin can be left floating in the system . \nW25Q128JV  \n \nPublication Release Date:  August 23 , 2021  \n- 12 -                                 Revision I 6.5 Write Protection  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise and other \nadverse system con ditions that may compromise data integrity. To address this concern, the W 25Q128JV  \nprovides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n6.5.1  Write Protect Features  \n\uf0b7 Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n\uf0b7 Time delay write disable after Power -up \n\uf0b7 Write enable/disable instructions and automatic write disable after erase or program  \n\uf0b7 Software and Hardware (/WP pin) write protection using Status Registers  \n\uf0b7 Additional Individual Block/Sector Locks for array protection  \n\uf0b7 Write Protection using Power -down ins truction  \n\uf0b7 Lock Down write protection for Status Register until the next power -up \n\uf0b7 One Time Program (OTP) write protection for array and Security Registers using Status Register* \n* Note:  This feature is available upon special flow. Please contact Winbond for  details.  \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down, the W 25Q128JV  will maintain a reset condition while VCC is below the \nthreshold value of V WI, (See Power -up Timing and Voltage Levels and Figure 43). While reset, all \noperations are disabled and no instructions are  recognized. During power -up and after the VCC voltage \nexceeds V WI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled for a time delay of t PUW. This \nincludes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase and the Write Status \nRegister instructions. Note that the chip select pin (/CS) must track the VCC supply level at power -up until \nthe VCC -min level and t VSL time delay is reached, and it must also track the VCC supply level at power -\ndown to prevent adverse command seque nce. If needed a pull -up resister on /CS can be used to \naccomplish this.  \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Status Register Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Write Enable instruction must be issued be fore a Page Program, Sector \nErase, Block Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction will be accepted. After completing a \nprogram, erase or write instruction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is automatically cleared to a write -\ndisabled state of 0.  \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instruction and setting the \nStatus Register Protect ( SRP, SRL) and Block Protect (CMP , TB, BP[3:0]) bits. These settings allow a \nportion or the entire memory array to be con figured as read only. Used in conjunction with the Write \nProtect (/WP) pin, changes to the Status Register can be enabled or disabled under hardware control. See \nStatus Register section for further information. Additionally, the Power -down instruction offe rs an extra \nlevel of write protection as all instructions are ignored except for the Release Power -down instruction.  \nThe W 25Q128JV  also provides another Write Protect method using the Individual Block Locks. Each \n64KB block (except the top and bottom block s, total of 126 blocks) and each 4KB sector within the \ntop/bottom blocks (total of 32 sectors) are equipped with an Individual Block Lock bit. When the lock bit is \n0, the corresponding sector or block can be erased or programmed; when the lock bit is set t o 1, Erase or \nProgram commands issued to the corresponding sector or block will be ignored. When the device is \npowered on, all Individual Block Lock bits will be 1, so the entire memory array is protected from \nErase/Program. An “Individual Block Unlock (39 h)” instruction must be issued to unlock any specific sector \nor block.  \nThe WPS bit in Status Register -3 is used to decide which Write Protect scheme should be used. When \nWPS=0 (factory default), the device will only utilize CMP, SEC, TB, BP[2:0] bits to pr otect specific areas of \nthe array; when WPS=1, the device will utilize the Individual Block Locks for write protection.  \nW25Q128JV \n \n \n- 13 - 7. STATUS  AND CONFIGURATION  REGISTERS  \nThree Status and Configuration Registers are provided for W 25Q128JV . The Read Status Register -1/2/3 \ninstructions can be used to provide status on the availability of the flash memory array, whether the device \nis write enabled or disabled, the state of write protection, Quad SPI setting, Security Register lock status,  \nErase/Program Suspend status, output  driver strength, power -up. The Write Status Register instruction \ncan be used to configure the device write protection features, Quad SPI setting, Security Register OTP locks,  \nand output driver strength. Write access to the Status Register is controlled by  the state of the  non-volatile \nStatus Register Protect bits ( SRL), the Write Enable instruction, and durin g Standard/Dual SPI operations  \n \n7.1 Status Registers  \n \n \n(volatile/non -volatile ) \n(volatile/non -volatile ) \n(volatile/non -volatile ) \n \nFigure 4 a. Status Register -1 \n7.1.1  Erase/Write In Progress ( BUSY ) – Status Only   \nBUSY is a read only bi t in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is executing a \nPage Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register or \nErase/Program Security Register instruction. During this time the device will ignore further instructions \nexcept for the Read Status Register and Erase /Program  Suspend instruction (see t W, tPP, tSE, tBE, and \ntCE in AC Characteristics). When the program, erase or write status /security  register instruction has \ncompleted, the BUSY  bit will be cleared to a 0 state indicating the device is ready for further instructions.   \n7.1.2  Write Enable Latch (WEL)  – Status Only  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the statu s register (S1) that is set to  1 after executing a \nWrite Enable Instr uction. Th e WEL status bit is cleared to  0 when the device is write disabled. A write \ndisable state occurs upon power -up or after any of the following instructions: Write Disable, Page \nProgram, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase,  Write Status Register , Erase \nSecurity Register and Program Security Register . \n7.1.3  Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0)  – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register (S4, S3, and \nS2) that provide Write Protection control and status. Block Protect bits can be set using the Write Status \nRegister Instruction (see t W in AC characteristics). All, none or a portion of the memory array can be \nprotected from Program and Erase instructions (see S tatus Register Memory Protection table). The \nfactory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of the array protected.   \nW25Q128JV  \n \nPublication Release Date:  August 23 , 2021  \n- 14 -                                 Revision I 7.1.4  Top/Bottom Block Protect  (TB) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe non-volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block  Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect from the \nTop (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in the Status Register Memory Protection table. \nThe f actory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the Write Status Register Instruction \ndepen ding on the state of the SRP, SRL and WEL bits.  \n7.1.5  Sector /Block  Protect Bit (SEC)  – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable   \nThe non -volatile Sector /Block  Protect bit (SEC)  controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect \neither 4KB Sectors (SEC=1) or 64KB Blocks (SEC=0) in the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array \nas shown in the Status Register Memory Protection table. The  default setting is SEC=0. \n7.1.6  Complement Protect (CMP)  – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S14). It is used in \nconjunction with SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits to provide more flexibility for the array protection. Once \nCMP is set to 1, previo us array protection set by SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 will be  reversed. For \ninstance, when CMP=0, a top 64KB block  can be protected while the rest of the array is not; when \nCMP=1, the top 64KB block  will become unprotected while the rest of the array become read -only. Please \nrefer to the Status Register Memory Prote ction table for details.

INSTRUCTIONS  \nThe Standard/Dual/Quad SPI instruction set of the W25 Q128JV  consists of 47 basic instructions that are \nfully controlled through the SPI bus (see Instruc tion Set Table1-2). Instructions are initiated with the falling \nedge of Chip Select (/CS) . The first byte of data clo cked into the DI  input provides the i nstruction code. \nData on the DI  input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with mo st significant bit  (MSB) first.  \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address bytes, data \nbytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a combination. Instructions are completed with the \nrising edge of edge  /CS. Clock r elative timing diagrams for each instruction are included in Figures 5 \nthrough 57. All read instructions can be completed after any clocked bit. However, all instructions that \nWrite, Program or Erase must complete on a byte boundary ( /CS driven high after a full 8 -bits have been \nclocked) otherwise the instruction will be ignor ed. This feature further protects the device from inadvertent \nwrites. Additionally, while the memory is being programmed or erased, or when the Status Register is \nbeing written, all in structions except for Read Status Register will be ignored until the program or erase \ncycle has completed.  \n8.1 Device ID and Instruction Set Tables  \n8.1.1  Manufacturer and Device Identification  \nMANUFACTURER ID  (MF7 - MF0)  \nWinbond Serial Flash  EFh \n \nDevice ID  (ID7 - ID0) (ID15  - ID0) \nInstruction   ABh, 90h , 92h, 94h  9Fh \nW25 Q128JV -IN/IQ/JQ 17h 4018h \nW25Q128JV -IM*/JM* 17h 7018h \n   Note: For DTR, QPI supporting, please refer to W25Q 128JV-M DTR datasheet.  \nW25Q128JV  \n \nPublication Release Date:  August 23 , 2021  \n- 22 -                                 Revision I 8.1.2   Instruction Set Table 1 (Standard SPI Instructions)(1) \nData Input Output  Byte 1  Byte 2  Byte 3  Byte 4  Byte 5  Byte 6  Byte 7  \nNumber  of Clock (1-1-1) 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \nWrite Enable  06h  \nVolatile SR Write Enable  50h  \nWrite Disable  04h  \nRelease Power -down / ID  ABh Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  (ID7-ID0)(2)  \nManufacturer/Device ID  90h Dummy  Dummy  00h (MF7 -MF0)  (ID7-ID0)  \nJEDEC ID  9Fh (MF7 -MF0)  (ID15 -ID8) (ID7-ID0)  \nRead Unique ID  4Bh Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  (UID63 -0)  \nRead Data  03h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 (D7-D0)  \nFast Read  0Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy  (D7-D0)  \nPage Program  02h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0 D7-D0(3)  \nSector Erase (4KB)  20h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nBlock Erase (32KB)  52h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nBlock Erase (64KB)  D8h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nChip Erase  C7h/60h  \nRead Status Register -1 05h (S7-S0)(2)  \nWrite Status Register -1(4) 01h (S7-S0)(4)  \nRead Status Register -2 35h (S15 -S8)(2)  \nWrite Status Register -2 31h (S15 -S8)  \nRead Status Register -3 15h (S23 -S16)(2)  \nWrite Status Register -3 11h (S23 -S16)   \nRead SFDP Register  5Ah 00 00 A7-A0 Dummy  (D7-D0)  \nErase Security Register(5) 44h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nProgram Security Register(5) 42h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0 D7-D0(3)  \nRead Security Register(5) 48h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy  (D7-D0)  \nGlobal Block Lock  7Eh  \nGlobal Block Unlock  98h  \nRead Block Lock  3Dh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 (L7-L0)  \nIndividual Block Lock  36h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nIndividual Block Unlock  39h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nErase / Program Suspend  75h  \nErase / Program Resume  7Ah  \nPower -down  B9h  \nEnable Reset  66h  \nReset Device  99h  \n \nW25Q128JV \n \n \n- 23 - 8.1.3   Instruction Set Table 2 (Dual/Quad SPI Instructions )  \nData Input Output  Byte 1  Byte 2  Byte 3  Byte 4  Byte 5  Byte 6  Byte 7  Byte 8  Byte 9 \nNumber of Clock (1-1-2) 8 8 8 8 4 4 4 4 4 \nFast Read Dual Output  3Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy  Dummy  (D7-D0)(7)  \nNumber of Clock (1-2-2) 8 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 \nFast Read Dual I/O  BBh A23-A16(6) A15-A8(6) A7-A0(6) Dummy(11) (D7-D0)(7) \n \nMftr./Device ID Dual I/O  92h A23-A16(6) A15-A8(6) 00(6) Dummy(11) (MF7 -MF0)  (ID7-ID0)(7)  \nNumber of Clock (1-1-4) 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 \nQuad Input Page Program  32h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 (D7-D0)(9) (D7-D0)(3) … \nFast Read Quad Output  6Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  (D7-D0)(10) \nNumber of Clock (1-4-4) 8 2(8) 2(8) 2(8) 2 2 2 2 2 \nMftr./Device ID Quad I/O  94h A23-A16 A15-A8 00 Dummy(11) Dummy  Dummy  (MF7 -MF0)  (ID7-ID0) \nFast Read Quad I/O  EBh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy(11) Dummy  Dummy  (D7-D0)  \nSet Burst with Wrap  77h Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  W8-W0  \nNotes:  \n1.

Refer to section 7.1 for Status Register descriptions.  \nThe Read Status Register instruction may be used at any time, even while a Program, Erase or Write \nStatus Register cycle is in progress. This allows the BUSY status bit to be ch ecked to determine when the \ncycle is complete and if the device can accept another instruction.

The writable Status \nRegister bits include: SEC, TB, BP[2:0] in Status Register -1; CMP, LB[3:1] , QE, SRL in Status Register -2; \nDRV1, DRV0, WPS in Status Register -3. All other Status Register bit locations are read -only and will not \nbe affected by the Write Status Register instruction. LB[3:1] are non -volatile OTP bits, once it is set to 1, it  \ncannot be cleared to 0.  \nTo write non -volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must previously have \nbeen executed for the device to accept the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL \nmust equal 1). Once w rite enabled, the instruction is entered by driving /CS low, sending the instruction \ncode “01h/31h/11h”, and then writing the status register data byte as illustrated in Figure 9a.  \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction must \nhave been executed prior to the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL remains 0). \nHowever, SRL and LB[3:1] cannot be changed from “1” to “0” because of the OTP protection for these \nbits. Upon power off o r the execution of a Software/Hardware Reset, the volatile Status Register bit values \nwill be lost, and the non -volatile Status Register bit values will be restored.  \nDuring non -volatile Status Register write operation (06h combined with 01h/31h/11h), after  /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Write Status Register cycle will commence for a time duration of t W (See AC \nCharacteristics). While the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction \nmay still be accessed to check the status of the BUSY bit.

The \ninstruction is initiated by driving the /CS  pin low and then shifting the instruction code “03h” followed by a \n24-bit address (A23 -A0) into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising edge of the \nCLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory locat ion will be shifted out \non the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The address is automatically \nincremented to the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted out allowing for a continuous \nstream of data. Thi s means that the entire memory can be accessed with a single instruction as long as \nthe clock continues. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nThe Read Data instruction sequence is shown in Figure 14. If a Read Data instruction is issued while an \nErase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any \neffects on the current cycle. The Read Data instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of f R \n(see AC Electrical Characteristics).  \nThe Read D ata (03h) instruction is only supported in Standard SPI mode. \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (03h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 724-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1\n**\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 14.

The Fast Read Dual Output instruction is ideal for quickly downloading code from Flash to \nRAM upon power -up or for applications that cache code -segments to RAM for execution.  \nSimilar to the Fast Read instruction, the Fast Read Dual Output instruction can operate at the highest \npossible frequency of F R (see AC Electrical Characteristics).

The “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) command can \neither enable or disable the “Wrap Around” feature for the following EBh commands. When “Wrap \nAround” is enabled, the data being accessed can be limited to either an 8, 16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a \n256-byte page. The output data starts at the initial address specified in the instruction, once it reaches the \nending boundary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte sec tion, the output will wrap around to the beginning boundary \nautomatically until /CS is pulled high to terminate the command.  \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical address and then \nfill the cache afterwa rds within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing multiple read \ncommands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction allows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be set. The W4 bit is used to \nenable or disable the “Wrap Around” operation while W6 -5 are used to specify the length of the wrap \naround section within a page.

Certain \napplications can benefit from this feature and improve the overall system code execution performance.  \nSimilar to a Quad I/O instruction , the Set Burst with Wrap instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low \nand then shifting the instruction code “77h” followed by 24 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap Bits”, W7 -0.

A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device \nwill accept the Page Program Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the  /CS pin low then shifting t he instruction code “02h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and \nat least one data byte, into the DI pin. The  /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction \nwhile data is being sent to the device. The Page Program instruction sequence  is shown in Figure 29.  \nIf an entire 256 byte page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significant address bits) \nshould be set to 0. If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks exceeds the remaining \npage length, the a ddressing will wrap to the beginning of the page. In some cases, less than 256 bytes (a \npartial page) can be programmed without having any effect on other bytes within the same page. One \ncondition to perform a partial page program is that the number of clo cks cannot exceed the remaining \npage length. If more than 256 bytes are sent to the device the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the \npage and overwrite previously sent data.  \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the /CS pin must be driven high a fter the eighth bit of the last byte \nhas been latched. If this is not done the Page Program instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Page Program instruction will commence for a time duration of tpp (See AC \nCharacteristics ). While the Page Program cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction may \nstill be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Page Program \ncycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept other instructions \nagain. After the Page Program cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register \nis cleared to 0.

The Quad Page Program can \nimprove performance for PROM Programmer and applications that have slow clock speeds <5MHz. \nSystems with faster clock speed will not realize much benefit  for the Quad Page Program instruction since \nthe inherent page program time is much greater than the time it take to clock -in the data.  \nTo use Quad Page Program the Quad Enable (QE) bit in Status Register -2 must be set to 1. A Write \nEnable instruction  must  be executed before the device will accept the Quad Page Program instruction \n(Status Register -1, WEL=1). The instruction is initiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting the \ninstruction code “32h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least one  data byte, into the IO pins. \nThe /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the device. \nAll other functions of Quad Page Program are identical to standard Page Program.

The Erase/Program Suspend instruction sequence is shown in Figure 35a.  \nThe Write Status Register instruction (01h) and Erase instructions (20h, 52h, D8h, C7h, 60h, 44h) are not \nallowed during Erase Suspend. Erase Suspend is valid only during the Sector or Block erase operation. If \nwritten during the Chip Erase operation, the Erase Suspend instruction is ignored. The Write Status \nRegister instruction (01h) and Program instructions (02h, 32h, 42h) are not allowed during Program \nSuspend. Program Suspend is valid only during the Page Program or Quad Page Program operation.  \nThe Erase/Program Suspend instruction “75h” will be accepted by the device only if the SUS bit in the \nStatus Register equals to 0 and the BUSY bit equals to 1 while a Sector or B lock Erase or a Page \nProgram operation is on -going. If the SUS bit equals to 1 or the BUSY bit equals to 0, the Suspend \ninstruction will be ignored by the device. A maximum of time of “t SUS” (See AC Characteristics) is required \nto suspend the erase or prog ram operation. The BUSY bit in the Status Register will be cleared from 1 to \n0 within “t SUS” and the SUS bit in the Status Register will be set from 0 to 1 immediately after \nErase/Program Suspend. For a previously resumed Erase/Program operation, it is als o required that the \nSuspend instruction “75h” is not issued earlier than a minimum of time of “t SUS” following the preceding \nResume instruction “7Ah”.  \nUnexpected power off during the Erase/Program suspend state will reset the device and release the \nsuspend  state. SUS bit in the Status Register will also reset to 0. The data within the page, sector or block \nthat was being suspended may become corrupted. It is recommended for the user to implement system \ndesign techniques against the accidental power interrup tion and preserve data integrity during \nerase/program suspend state.  \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (75h)\nHigh ImpedanceMode 0Mode 3tSUS\nAccept instructions\n \nFigure 35a.

If the SUS bit equals to 0 or the BUSY bit equals to 1, the Resume instruction “7 Ah” \nwill be ignored by the device. The Erase/Program Resume instruction sequence is shown in Figure 36a .  \nResume instruction is ignored if the previous Erase/Program Suspend operation was interrupted by \nunexpected power off.

The lower power consumption makes the Power -down \ninstruction especially useful for battery powered applications (See ICC1 and ICC2 in AC Characteristics). \nThe instruc tion is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “B9h” as shown in \nFigure 37a.  \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the Power -down \ninstruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the power -down state will entered within the time \nduration of t DP (See AC Characteristics). While in the power -down state only the Release Power -down / \nDevice ID (ABh) instruction, which restores the device to normal operation, will be recognized. All other \ninstructions are ignored. This includes the Read Status Register instruction, which is always available \nduring normal operation. Ignoring all but one instruction makes the Power Down state a useful condition \nfor securing maximum write  protection.

It can be used to \nrelease the device from the power -down state , or obtain the devices electronic identification (ID) number.  \nTo release the device from the power -down state, the instruction is issued by driving the /CS pin low, \nshifting the in struction code “ABh” and driving /CS high as shown in Figure 38a. Release from power -down \nwill take the time duration of t RES1 (See AC Characteristics) before the device will resume normal \noperation and other instructions are accepted. The /CS pin must rem ain high during the t RES1 time \nduration.  \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the power -down state, the instruction is initiated by \ndriving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3 -dummy bytes. The Device ID \nbits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The Device ID \nvalue for the W25Q128 JV is listed in Manufacturer and Device Identification table. The Device ID can be \nread continuously. The instruction is completed by  driving /CS high.  \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obtain the Device ID, the instruction is \nthe same as previously described, and shown in Figure 38c, except that after /CS is driven high it must \nremain high for a time durati on of t RES2 (See AC Characteristics). After this time duration the device will \nresume normal operation and other instructions will be accepted. If the Release from Power -down / \nDevice ID instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in pr ocess (when BUSY equals \n1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effects on the current cycle. \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (ABh)Mode 0Mode 3tRES1\nPower-down current Stand-by current\n \nFigure 38a.

The SFDP parameters \nare stored in one or more Pa rameter Identification (PID) tables. Currently only one PID table is specified, \nbut more may be added in the future.  The Read SFDP Register instruction is com patible with the SFDP \nstandard initially established in 2010  for PC and other applications, as wel l as the JEDEC standard \nJESD216 -serials  that is published in 2011 . Most Winbond SpiFlash Memories shipped after June 2011 \n(date code 1124 and beyond) support the SFDP feature as specified in the applicable datasheet.  \nThe Read SFDP instruction is initiated  by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “5Ah” \nfollowed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0)(1) into the DI pin. Eight “dummy” clocks are also required before the \nSFDP register contents are shifted out on the falling edge of the 40th CLK with most significant bit (MSB) \nfirst as shown in Figure  44.

These registers may be used by the sys tem manufacturers to store security and other \nimportant information separately from the main memory array.  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction is similar to the Sector Erase instruction. A Write Enable \ninstruction must be executed before the device wil l accept the Erase Security Register Instruction (Status \nRegister bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “44h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) to erase one of the three securit y registers.  \n \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction sequence  is shown in Figure 45. The /CS pin must be driven high \nafter the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the instruction will not be executed. \nAfter /CS is driven high, the self -timed Erase Security Register operation will commen ce for a time \nduration of t SE (See AC Characteristics). While the Erase Security Register cycle is in progress, the Read \nStatus Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is \na 1 during the erase cycle a nd becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept \nother instructions again. After the Erase Security Register cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch \n(WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Security Register Lock B its (LB3 -1) in the Status \nRegister -2 can be used to OTP protect the security registers.

It allows from one \nbyte to 256 bytes o f security register data to be programmed at previously erased  (FFh) memory locations. \nA Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Program Security Register \nInstruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The instruction is init iated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting \nthe instruction code “42h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. \nThe /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to t he device.  \n \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \n \nThe Program Security Register instruction s equence is shown in Figure 46.

The instruction is initiated by driving \nthe /CS pin low and then shifting the instruction code “48h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and \neight “dummy ” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising edge of the CLK \npin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location will be shifted out on \nthe DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most signific ant bit (MSB) first. The byte address is \nautomatically incremented to the next byte address after each byte of data is shifted out. Once the byte \naddress reaches the last byte of the register (byte address FFh), it will reset to address 00h, the first byte  \nof the register, and continue to increment. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high. The Read \nSecurity Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 47. If a Read Security Register instruction is \nissued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle i s in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will \nnot have any effects on the current cycle. The Read Security Register instruction allows clock rates from \nD.C. to a maximum of F R (see AC Electrical Characteristics).  \n \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (48h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1*\n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\nDummy Byte\nHigh Impedance40 41 42 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7Data Out 2\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 043 31\n0= MSB*\n \nFigure 47.

Once the Reset instruction is accepted, any \non-going internal operations will be terminated and the device will return to its default power -on state and \nlose a ll the current volatile settings, such as Volatile Status Register bits, Write Enable Latch (WEL) \nstatus, Program/Erase Suspend status, Read parameter setting (P7 -P0), and Wrap Bit setting (W6 -W4).  \n“Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” instructions can be  issued in SPI. To  avoid accidental reset, both \ninstructions must be issued in sequence. Any other commands other than “Reset (99h)” after the “Enable \nReset (66h)” command will disable the “Reset Enable” state. A new sequence of “Enable Reset (66h)” and \n“Reset (99h)” is needed to reset the device. Once the Reset command is accepted by the device, the \ndevice will take approximately tRST=30us to reset. During this period, no command will be accepted.  \nData corruption may happen if there is an on -going or suspe nded internal Erase or Program operation \nwhen Reset command sequence is accepted by the device. It is recommended to check the BUSY bit and \nthe SUS bit in Status Register before issuing the Reset command sequence.  \nMode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (99h)Mode 0Mode 3/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (66h)\nHigh Impedance\n \nFigure 58a.
