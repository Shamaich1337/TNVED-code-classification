E 12/163\nSID11x2K\nwww.power.com  \nSCALE-iDriver Functional Description\nThe single channel SCALE-iDriver ™ family is designed to drive IGBTs \nand MOSFETs or other semiconductor power switches with a blocking \nvoltage of up to 1200 V and provide reinforced isolation between micro-controller and the power semiconductor switch.  The logic input (PWM) command signals applied via the IN pin and the primary supply voltage supplied via the VCC pin are both reference to the GND pin.  The working status of the power semiconductor switch and SCALE-iDriver is monitored via the SO pin. \nPMW command signals are transferred from the primary (IN) to \nsecondary-side via FluxLink isolation technology.  The GH pin supplies a positive gate voltage and charges the semiconductor gate during the turn-on process.  The GL pin supplies the negative voltage and discharges the gate during the turn-off process.  \nShort-circuit protection is implemented using a desaturation detection \ntechnique monitored via the VCE pin.  After the SCALE-iDriver detects a short-circuit, the semiconductor turn-off process is implemented  using an Advanced Soft Shut Down (ASSD) technique.\nPower Supplies\nThe SID11x2K requires two power supplies.  One is the primary-side \n(V\nVCC) which powers the primary-side logic and communication with \nthe secondary (insulated) side.  One supply voltage is required for the \nsecondary-side, VTOT is applied between the VISO pin and the COM \npin.  VTOT needs to be insulated from the primary-side and must \nprovide at least the same insulation capabilities as the SCALE-iDriver.  V\nTOT must have a low capacitive coupling to the primary or any other \nsecondary-side.  The positive gate-emitter voltage is provided by VVISO \nwhich is internally generated and stabilized to 15 V (typically) with respect to VEE.  The negative gate-emitter voltage is provided by V\nVEE \nwith respect to COM.  Due to the limited current sourcing capabilities of the VEE pin, any additional load needs to be applied between the VISO and COM pins.  No additional load between VISO and VEE pins or between VEE and COM pins is allowed. \nInput and Fault Logic (Primary-Side)\nThe input (IN) and output (SO) logic is designed to work directly with \nmicro-controllers using 5 V CMOS logic.  If the physical distance \nbetween the controller and the SCALE-iDriver is large or if a different logic level is required the resistive divider in Figure 5, or Schmitt-trigger ICs (Figures 13 and 14) can be used.  Both solutions adjust the logic level as necessary and will also improve the driver’s noise immunity. \nGate driver commands are transferred from the IN pin to the GH and \nGL pins with a propagation delay t\nP(LH) and tP(HL). \nDuring normal operation, when there is no fault detected, the SO pin \nstays at high impedance (open).  Any fault is reported by connecting the SO pin to GND.  The SO pin stays low as long as the V\nVCC voltage \n(primary-side) stays below UVLOVCC, and the propagation delay is  \nnegligible.  If desaturation is detected (there is a short-circuit), or the supply voltages V\nVISO, VVEE, (secondary-side) drop below UVLOVISO, \nUVLOVEE, the SO status changes with a delay time tFAULT and keeps \nstatus low for a time defined as tSO.  In case of a fault condition the \ndriver applies the off-state (the GL pin is connected to COM).  During the t\nSO period, command signal transitions from the IN pin are \nignored.  A new turn-on command transition is required before the driver will enter the on-state. \nThe SO pin current is defined as I\nSO; voltage during low status is \ndefined as VSO(FAULT). \nOutput (Secondary-Side) \nThe gate of the power semiconductor switch to be driven can be \nconnected to the SCALE-iDriver output via pins GH and GL, using two different resistor values.  Turn-on gate resistor R\nGON needs to be connected to the GH pin and turn-off gate resistor RGOFF to the GL pin.  \nIf both gate resistors have the same value, the GL and GH pins can be connected together.  Note: The SCALE-iDriver data sheet defines the R\nGH and RGL values as total resistances connected to the respective \npins GH and GL.  Note that most power semiconductor data sheets specify an internal gate resistor R\nGINT which is already integrated into \nthe power semiconductor switch.  In Addition to RGINT, external \nresistor devices RGON and RGOFF are specified to setup the gate current \nlevels to the application requirements. Consequently, RGH is the sum \nof RGON and RGINT, as shown in Figures 9 and 10.  Careful consideration \nshould be given to the power dissipation and peak current associated with the external gate resistors.\nThe GH pin output current source (I\nGH) of SID1182K is capable of \nhandling up to 7.3 A during turn-on, and the GL pin output current source (I\nGL) is able to sink up to 8.0 A during turn-off.  The SCALE-\niDriver’s internal resistances are described as RGHI and RGLI respec -\ntively.  If the gate resistors for SCALE-iDriver family attempt to draw a higher peak current, the peak current will be internally limited to a safe value, see Figures 6 and 7.  Figure 8 shows the peak current  Figure 5.  I ncreased Threshold Voltages VIN+LT and VIN+HT. For R1 = 3.3 k W and  \n R2 = 1 k W the IN Logic Level is 15 V.\nFigure 6.

Desatu -\nration can be detected using two different circuits, either with diode sense circuitry D\nVCE (Figure 10) or with resistors RVCEX (Figure 9).  With \nthe help of a well stabilized VVISO and a Schottky diode (DSTO) connected \nbetween semiconductor gate and VISO pin the short-circuit current value can be limited to a safe value. \nDuring the off-state, the VCE pin is internally connected to the COM \npin and C\nRES is discharged (red curve in Figure 11 represents the \npotential of the VCE pin).  When the power semiconductor switch receives a turn-on command, the collector-emitter voltage (V\nCE) \ndecreases from the off-state level same as the DC-link voltage to a normally much lower on-state level (see blue curve in Figure 11) and C\nRES begins to be charged up to the VCE saturation level (VCE SAT).  CRES \ncharging time depends on the resistance of RVCEX (Figure 9), DC-link \nvoltage and CRES and RVCE value.  The VCE voltage during on-state is \ncontinuously observed and compared with a reference voltage, VDES.  \nThe VDES level is optimized for IGBT applications.  As soon as VCE>VDES \n(red circle in Figure 11), the driver turns off the power semiconductor switch with a controlled collector current slope, limiting the V\nCE \novervoltage excursions to below the maximum collector-emitter voltage (V\nCES).  Turn-on commands during this time and during tSO are \nignored, and the SO pin is connected to GND. \nThe response time tRES is the CRES charging time and describes the \ndelay between VCE asserting and the voltage on the VCE pin rising \n(see Figure 11).  Response time should be long enough to avoid false tripping during semiconductor turn-on and is adjustable via R\nRES and \nCRES (Figure 10) or RVCE and CRES (Figure 9) values.  It should not be \nlonger than the period allowed by the semiconductor manufacturer.\nSafe Power-Up and Power-Down\nDuring driver power-up and power-down, several unintended input / \noutput states may occur.  In order to avoid these effects, it is \nrecommended that the IN pin is kept at logic low during power-up and power-down.  Any supply voltage related to VCC, VISO, VEE and VGXX pins should be stabilized using ceramic capacitors C\n1, CS1X, CS2X, \nCGXX respectively as shown in Figures 13 and 14.  After supply \nvoltages reach their nominal values, the driver will begin to function after a time delay t\nSTART. \nShort-Pulse Operation \nIf command signals applied to the IN pin are shorter than the minimum \nspecified by tGE(MIN), then SCALE-iDriver output signals, GH and GL \npins, will extend to value tGE(MIN).  The duration of pulses longer than \ntGE(MIN) will not be changed.

It protects \nthe power semiconductor switch against destruction by ending the \nturn-on state and limiting the current slope in order to keep momen -\ntary VCE overvoltages below VCES.  This function is particularly suited to \nIGBT applications.  Figure 12 shows how the ASSD function operates.  The V\nCE desaturation is visible during time period P1 (yellow line).  \nDuring this time, the gate-emitter voltage (green line) is kept very stable.  Collector current (pink line) is also well stabilized and limited \nFigure 12.  Adv anced Soft Shut Down Function.to a safe value.  At the end of period P1, VGE is reduced during tFSSD1.  \nDue to collector current decrease a small VCE overvoltage is seen.  \nDuring tFSSD1 VGE is further reduced and the gate of the power \nsemiconductor switch is further discharged.  During tFSSD2 additional \nsmall VCE overvoltage events may occur.  Once VGE drops below the \ngate threshold of the IGBT, the collector current has decayed almost to zero and the remaining gate charge is removed ‒ ending the short-  \ncircuit event.  The whole short-circuit current detection and safe switch-off is lower than 10 µ s (8 µ s in this example).\nICEVGE\nVCEIGE\nP1tFSSD1\ntFSSD2PI-7951-080416VCE\nVGXX\nVISO\nGHRRESRVCE\nDSTOCGXX\nRGOFFDVCE\nEmitterCollectorRGONCRES\nGL\nVEE\nCOMSCALE-iDriver\nGate RGINT\nRev.

S CALE-iDriver Application Example Using Diodes for Desaturation Detection.Application Examples and Components Selection\nFigures 13 and 14 show the schematic and typical components used \nfor a SCALE-iDriver design.  In both cases the primary-side supply \nvoltage (VVCC) is connected between VCC and GND pins and supported \nthrough a supply bypass ceramic capacitor C1 (4.7 µF typically).  If the \ncommand signal voltage level is higher than the rated IN pin voltage (in this case 15 V) a resistive voltage divider should be used.  Additional capacitor C\nF and Schmitt trigger IC1 can be used to provide input \nsignal filtering.  The SO output has 5 V logic and the RSO is selected \nso that it does not exceed absolute maximum rated ISO current.\nThe secondary-side isolated power supply (VTOT) is connected between \nVISO and COM.  The positive voltage rail (VVISO) is supported through \n4.7 µF ceramic capacitors CS21 and CS22 connected in parallel.  The \nnegative voltage rail (VVEE) is similarly supported through capacitors CS11 and CS12.  The gate charge will vary according to the type of \npower semiconductor switch that is being driven.  Typically, CS11 + CS12 \nshould be at least 3 µF multiplied by the total gate charge of the \npower semiconductor switch (QGATE) divided by 1 µC.  A 10 nF capacitor \nCGXX is connected between the GH and VGXX pins. \nThe gate of the power semiconductor switch is connected through \nresistor RGON to the GH pin and by RGOFF to the GL pin.  If the value of \nRGON is the same as RGOFF the GH pin can be connected to the GL pin \nand a common gate resistor can be connected to the gate.  In each case, proper consideration needs to be given to the power dissipation and temperature performance of the gate resistors. \nTo ensure gate voltage stabilization and collector current limitation \nduring a short-circuit, the gate is connected to the VISO pin through a Schottky diode D\nSTO (for example PMEG4010). \nPI-7953-092216CGXX\n10 nF\nCS21\n4.7 µFCS22\n4.7 µF\nCS11\n4.7 µFCS12\n4.7 µFRGON\nRGOFFRVCE\n330 ΩDVCE2 DVCE1\nCRES\n33-330 pF\nRGE\n6.8 kΩRRES\n24-62 kΩ\nGate\nEmitterCollectorIN\nSO\nVCC\nGNDCFSO\nRSO\n4.7 kΩ\nR2\n1 kΩR1\n3.3 kΩ\nVCC\nGNDIC1\n74LVC\nC14.7 µFCommand\nSignal\nDSTOSCALE-iDriver\nPrimary-Side\nLogicSecondary-Side\nLogicVCE\nVISOVGXX\nGH\nGL\nVEE\nCOMVTOT+- FluxLinkPrimary-Side\nLogic\nIN\nSO\nVCC\nGNDCFSO\nRSO\n4.7 k Ω\nR2\n1 kΩR1\n3.3 k Ω\nVCC\nGNDC14.7 µFCommand\nSignalDCL\nBAS416\nPI-7954-092216CGXX\n10 nF\nCS21\n4.7 µFCS22\n4.7 µF\nCS11\n4.7 µFCS12\n4.7 µFRGON\nRGOFFRVCE2-11\n100 k Ω × 10\nCRES\n33 pF\nRGE\n6.8 k ΩGate\nEmitterCollectorDSTOSCALE-iDriver\nPrimary-Side\nLogicSecondary-Side\nLogicRVCE\n120 k ΩVCE\nVISOVGXX\nGH\nGL\nVEE\nCOMVTOT+- FluxLinkIC1\n74LVC\nRev. E 12/167\nSID11x2K\nwww.power.com  \nTo avoid parasitic power-switch-conduction  during system power-on, \nthe gate is connected to COM through 6.8 k W resistor. \nFigure 13 shows how switch desaturation can be measured using \nresistors RVCE2 – RVCE11.  In this example all the resistors have a value \nof 100 k W and 1206 size.  The total resistance is 1 M W.  The resistors \nshould be chosen to limit current to between 0.6 mA to 0.8 mA at \nmaximum DC-link voltage.  The sum of RVCE2 – RVCE11 should be \napproximately 1 M W for 1200 V semiconductors and 500 k W for 600 V \nsemiconductors.  In each case the resistor string must provide sufficient creepage and clearance distances between collector of the semiconductor and SCALE-iDriver.  The low leakage diode D\nCL keeps \nthe short-circuit duration constant over a wide DC-link voltage range.  \nResponse time is set up through RVCE and CRES (typically 120 k W and \n33 pF respectively for 1200 V semiconductors).  If short-circuit detection proves to be too sensitive, the C\nRES value can be increased.  \nThe maximum short-circuit duration must be limited to the maximum value given in the semiconductor data sheet. \nFigure 14 illustrates how diodes D\nVCE1 and DVCE2 may be used to \nmeasure switch desaturation.  For insulation, two diodes in SMD packages are used (STTH212U for example).  R\nRES connected to VISO \nguarantees current flow through the diodes when the semiconductor is in the on-state.  When the switch desaturates, C\nRES starts to be \ncharged through RRES.  In this configuration the response time is \ncontrolled by RRES and CRES.  In this application example CRES = 33 pF \nand RRES = 62 k W; if desaturation is too sensitive or the short-circuit \nduration too long, both CRES and RRES can be adjusted.  \nFigure 15 shows the recommended PCB layout and corresponds to \nthe schematic in Figure 13.  The PCB is a two layer design.  It is important to ensure that PCB traces do not cover the area below the desaturation resistors or diodes D\nVCE1 and DVCE2.  This is a critical \ndesign requirement to avoid coupling capacitance with the SCALE-\niDriver’s VCE pin and isolation issues within the PCB.  \nGate resistors are located physically close to the power semiconductor \nswitch.  As these components can get hot, it is recommended that \nthey are placed away from the SCALE-iDriver.\nPower Dissipation and IC Junction  \nTemperature Estimation\nFirst calculation in designing the power semiconductor switch gate \ndriver stage is to calculate the required gate power - PDRV.

Thermal stress beyond those values but below thermal \nderating curve may lead to permanent functional product damage.  Operating beyond thermal SR derating curve may affect product reliability.\nNOTES:\n1.   VVCC = 5 V, VTOT = 25 V; GH and GL pins are shorted together. RG = 4 W, No CG; VCC pin is connected to the SO pin through a 2 k W resistor. \nThe VGXX pin is connected to the GH pin through a 10 nF capacitor. Typical values are defined at TJ = 25 °C; fS = 20 kHz, Duty Cycle = \n50%. Positive currents are assumed to be flowing into pins. \n2.  P ulse width ≤ 10 µs, duty cycle ≤ 1%. The maximum value is controlled by the ASIC to a safe level. There is no need to limit the current by \nthe application. The internal peak power is safely controlled for RG ≥ 0 and power semiconductor module input gate capacitance CIES ≤ 47 nF. \n3. D uring very slow VVCC power-up and power-down related to VTOT, VVCC and VVEE respectively, several SO fault pulses may be generated.\n4.

Delay is measured from 50% voltage decrease on IN pin to 10% voltage decrease  \non GL pin.\n7. M easured from 10% to 90% of VGE (CG simulates semiconductor gate capacitance). The VGE is measured across CG.  \n8. M easured from 90% to 10% of VGE (CG simulates semiconductor gate capacitance). The VGE is measured across CG. \n9.

T he amount of time needed to transfer fault event (UVLO or DESAT) from secondary-side to SO pin.\n11. T he amount of time after primary and secondary-side supply voltages (VVCC and VTOT) reach minimal required level for driver proper  \noperation. No signal is transferred from primary to secondary-side during that time, and no fault condition will be transferred from the \nsecondary-side to the primary-side.\n12. G uaranteed by design.\n13.  P ositive current is flowing out of the pin. \n14. S afety distances are application dependent and the creepage and clearance requirements should follow specific equipment isolation \nstandards of an application.
