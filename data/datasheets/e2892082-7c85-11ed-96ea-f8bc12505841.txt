General description\nPTN3460I is an (embedded) DisplayPort to LVDS  bridge device that enables connectivity \nbetween an (embedded) DisplayPort (eDP) source and LVDS display panel. It processes \nthe incoming DisplayPort (DP) stream, perfo rms DP to LVDS protocol conversion and \ntransmits processed stream in LVDS format.\nPTN3460I has two high-speed ports: Receive port facing DP Source (for example, \nCPU/GPU/chip set), Transmit port facing the LVDS receiver (for example, LVDS display \npanel controller). The PTN3460 I can receive DP stream at  link rate 1.62 Gbit/s or \n2.7 Gbit/s and it can support 1-lane or 2-lane DP operation. It interacts with DP source via \nDP Auxiliary (AUX) channel transactions for DP link training and setup.\nIt supports single bus or dual bus LVDS signa ling with color depths of 18 bits per pixel or \n24 bits per pixel and pixel clock frequency up to 112 MHz. The LVDS data packing can be \ndone either in VESA or JE IDA format. Also, the DP AUX interface transports \nI2C-over-AUX commands and support EDID-D DC communication with LVDS panel. To \nsupport panels without EDID ROM, the PTN3460I can emulate EDID ROM behavior \navoiding specific changes  in system video BIOS.\nPTN3460I is suitable for industrial design due to its wide temperature range of \uf02d40 \uf0b0C to \n+85 \uf0b0C.\nPTN3460I provides high flexib ility to optimally fit under different platform environments. It \nsupports three configuration options: multi-le vel configuration pins, DP AUX interface, and \nI2C-bus interface.\nPTN3460I can be powered by either 3.3 V supply only or dual supplies (3.3 V/1.8 V) and \nis available in the HVQFN56 7 mm \uf0b47 mm package with 0.4 mm pitch.\n2.

Given that the device is targeted primarily for \nembedded Display connectivity, both Display Authentication and Copy Protection Method 3a (Alternate Scrambler Seed Reset) and Method 3b (Enhanced Framing) are \nsupported, as per eDP 1.2 .\nThe PTN3460I DPCD registers can be access ed by DP source through AUX channel.

All rights re served.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 2.1 — 16 August 2016 10 of 42NXP Semiconductors PTN3460I\neDP to LVDS bridge for industrial and embedded applications\nNative AUX transactions are used to access PTN3460I Displ ayPort Configuration Data \n(DPCD) registers (for example, to facilitat e Link training, check error conditions) and \nI2C-over-AUX transactions are used to perform any required access to DDC bus (for \nexample, EDID reads).\nGiven that the HPDRX pin is internally connected to GND through an integrated pull-down \nresistor (> 100 k \uf057), the DP source will see HPDRX pin as LOW indicating that the \nDisplayPort receiver is not ready when the devi ce is not powered. This helps avoid raising \nfalse events to the source. After power-up, PTN3460I continues to drive HPDRX pin LOW until completion of internal initialization. After this, PTN 3460I generates HPD signal to \nnotify DP source and take corrective action(s).\n8.1.1 DP Link\nPTN3460I is capable of operating either in DP 2-lane or 1-lane mode. \nDP 1-lane or 2-lane mode is selected through configuration pin CFG3. See Table 4  for \nmore details.\n \n8.1.2 DPCD registers\nDPCD registers are de scribed in VESA DisplayPort v1.1a/1. 2a specifications in detail and \nPTN3460I supports DPCD version 1.2.\nPTN3460I configuration registers can be accessed through DP AUX channel from the \nGPU/CPU, if required. They are defined unde r vendor-specific region starting at base \naddress 0x00510h. So any configuration register can be accessed at DPCD address obtained by adding the register offset and base address. \nPTN3460I supports down spreading on DP link and this is reflected in DPCD register \nMAX_DOWNSPREAD at address 0003h. Further, the DP source could control \ndown spreading and inform PTN3460I via DOWNSPREAD_CTRL register at DPCD register 00107h.\nThe key aspect is that the system designer must take care that the Input video payload fits \nwell within both DP link bandwidth and LVDS bandwidth (for a given pixel frequency, SSC depths) when clock spreading is enabled . Also, another aspect for the system \ndesigner is to ensure LVDS (panel) TCONs are capable of handling SSC modulated LVDS signaling.Table 4.

PTN3460I can \npacketize RGB video data, HSYNC, VSYNC, DE either in VESA or JEIDA format. To enable system EMI reduction, the device can be programmed for center spreading of \nLVDS channel clock outputs.\nThe LVDS interface can be flexibly configured using multi-level configuration pins (CFG1, \nCFG2) or via register interface. The configuration pins and the corresponding definitions \nare described in Table 5\n and Table 6 . Nevertheless, as the configuration pins are \ndesigned for general purpose, their definition s can be modified and they can be used for \nany other purposes. However, this can be achieved through firmware upgrade only.\n \n Table 5.

All rights re served.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 2.1 — 16 August 2016 14 of 42NXP Semiconductors PTN3460I\neDP to LVDS bridge for industrial and embedded applications\n8.3 System control and operation\nWith its combination of embedded microcontroller, non-volatile memory, DPCD AUX and \nI2C-bus interfaces, PTN3460I delivers signific ant value for customer applications by \nproviding higher degree of control and programmability.\nBy default, all user controllable register s can be accessed through DPCD AUX interface. \nThis interface is always en abled. This AUX interface de livers seamless access of \nPTN3460I registers to system/platform (G PU) firmware driver. Nevertheless, use of \nI2C-bus interface for configuring PTN3460I is left to the choice of  system integrator.\nDEV_CFG (pin 12) sets up I2C-bus configuration mode:\n•Pull-down resistor to GND — PTN3460I operates as I2C-bus slave, low address \n(0x40h)\n•Open — PTN3460I operates as I2C-bus slave, high address (0xC0h)\n•Pull-up resistor to V DD(3V3)  — PTN3460I operates as I2C-bus master capable of \nreading from external EEPROM\nRemark: PTN3460I I2C pins are not failsafe and c annot be connected to the SMBus if the \nSMBus has active communications during VD D33 supply switch ON. In the application \nthere MUST be no MS_I2C traffic during supply rise-up.\n8.3.1 Reset and power-on initialization\nThe device has a built-in reset circuitry that generates internal reset signal after power-on. \nAll the internal registers and state machines are initialized and the registers take default \nvalues. In addition, PTN3460I has a dedicate d control pin RST_N. This serves the same \npurpose as power-on reset, but without power cycling of the device/platform.\nPTN3460I starts up in a default condition after power-on or after RST_N is toggled from \nLOW to HIGH. The configuration pins are sample d at power-on, or external reset, or when \nreturning from Deep Sleep. \nPTN3460I has a built-in reset circuitry that generates internal reset signal after power-on. \nAll the internal registers and state machines are synchronously initialized and the registers take default values. Though PTN3460I is designed NOT to need the RST_N pin, \nRST_N is still provided. This serves the same purpose as power-on  reset, but without \npower cycling of the device/platform.\nIt is good practice to provide for RST_N cont rol if EPS_N is LOW (external 1.8 V supply is \nused). In case RST_N is used, it must be re leased after all supplies are within operating \nconditions.PTN3460I starts up in a default condition after power-on or after RST_N is toggled from \nLOW to HIGH. The configuration pins are sampled at power-on and when there is change \nof state (for example, from Power saving state to Active state). \nDevice start-up time from power- on and RST_N = HIGH is 90 ms max.\nRemark: Driving RST_N HIGH is not possible and forbidden during power-up, because \nthe ESD diodes will clamp the signal to the VDDIO+0.6 V. RST_N pin should be left at \nTri-state level during power-up. \nPTN3460I All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2016.

This will \ntrigger a power-down sequence.\nPD_N and RST_N can be controlled by GPIO pins of system microcontroller. To leave \nDeep power-saving state, the system needs to drive PD_N back to HIGH, then issue a \nRST_N pulse for at least 10 \uf06ds. If PD_N pin is open, th e device will not enter Deep \npower-saving state. Once the device is in Deep power-saving condition, the HPDRX pin \nwill go LOW automatically and this  can be used by the system to remove the 3.3 V supply, \nif required.PTN3460I will not respect the Panel power-do wn sequence if PD_N is asserted LOW \nwhile video is being streamed to the display;  the system is not supposed to toggle PD_N \nand RST_N pins asynchronously while the LVDS output is streaming video to the display \npanel, but instead follow the panel powering sequence as described in Section 8.3.5\n.\nThe time between PD_N going HIGH and HPD raised HIGH by PTN3460I is also 90 ms \nmax.Fig 4.

Also, PTN3460I supports LVDS panel \ncontrol pins — backlight enable, panel power enable and PWM — that can be set via AUX \ncommands.\n•PVCCEN pin  — the signal output is set based on SET_POWER DPCD register \n00600h and SET_POWER_CAPABLE bit of EDP_GENERAL_CAPABILITY_REGISTER_1 DPCD register 00701h and detection \nand handling of video data stream by PTN3460I\n•BKLTEN pin  — the signal output is set based on \nBACKLIGHT_PIN_ENABLE_CAPABLE bit of EDP_GENERAL_CAPABILITY_REGISTER _1 DPCD register 00701h and \nBACKLIGHT_ENABLE bit of EDP_DISPLA Y_CONTROL_REGISTER DPCD register \n00720h\n•PWMO pin  — the PWM signal generated by PT N3460I based on controls set in \nDPCD registers. In addition, PTN3460I can pass through PWM signal from eDP source as well. \nAll the panel control enable and signal outputs from PTN3460I are aligned with panel power-on sequence timing including LVDS video output generation. It is important to note that the Panel power must be delivered by the system platform and it should be gated by \nPVCCEN signal.\nPTN3460I All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2016.

Once presence of video data is  detected, PTN3460I will assert PVCCEN to \nHIGH, synchronize to video st ream, output LVDS data and as sert rise the Sink_status \nlock as indicated in DPCD register (0 x00205h). PTN3460I will wait for Backlight \nenabling delay (T3) to avoid visual artifacts and program the BKLTEN HIGH.\n•While transitioning out of Active state by receiving DPCD 0x600 to set PTN3460I in \nD3 mode, PTN3460I will disable BKLTEN prior to cutting off Video streaming to avoid \nvisible artifacts following specific panel specifications. PTN3460I will assert PVCCEN \nto LOW after T5 delay as long as either if the video stream is stopped or video \nsynchronization is lost. This is to avoid dr iving the LVDS panel with illegal stream for \nlong periods of time. It is good practice for sources to keep video data or at least \nDP-idle stream active during T4 + T5.\n•When PTN3460I is in Low-power state ( DisplayPort D3 power state), the LVDS \ndifferential I/Os are weakly pulled down to  0 V. In this state, PVCCEN and BKLTEN \nare pulled LOW.\n•When PD_N is LOW, which sets PTN3460I in Deep power-saving state, the BKLTEN pin is set to LOW. LVDS differential I/Os are pulled LOW via the weak pull-downs.T2: Time interval between panel power enable signal (PVCCE N) going HIGH and video data/clock driven on LVDS interface.\nT3: Time interval between valid video data/clock on LVDS interface and backlight enable signal (BKLTEN) going HIGH.\nT4: Time interval between backlight enable signal (BKLTEN)  made LOW and stopping of video data/clock on LVDS interface.\nT5: Time interval between stopping of video data/clock on LV DS interface and panel power enable signal (PVCCEN) made \nLOW.\nT12: Time interval for which PVCCEN is held LOW before it can be made HIGH.\nFig 6.

It relies fully on the clock derived internally \nfrom incoming DP stream or on-chip clock generator.\n8.3.8 Power supply\nPTN3460I can be flexibly supplied with either 3.3 V supply only or dual supplies (3.3 V/1.8 V). When supplied with 3.3 V supply only, the integrated regulator is used to \ngenerate 1.8 V for inte rnal circuit operation. In this case, the EPS_N pin must be pulled \nHIGH or left open. For optimal power consum ption, dual supply option (3.3 V and 1.8 V) is \nrecommended.\n \n•EPS_N pin not connected\n•VDD(1V8)  total decoupling C decap < 8 \uf06dF total\nThe 8 \uf06d F is 4.7 \uf06dF + 100 nF on pin 19 + 100 nF on pin 45 + 2.2 \uf06dF + 100 nF on pin 6 + \n10 %\n8.3.9 Power-on reset\nFigure 8  shows a possible curve of the regulated VDD(1v8) voltage with dips at t2 to t3 \nand t4 to t5. The on-chip reset_n (active LOW) starts active at t0. At t1, the voltage gets higher than the Vtrip(H) level and if this condition is maintained for a period longer than Thigh, a delay element will add a nother Tporp before the on-chip reset_n is de-a sserted. If \nthe voltage drops below Vtrip(L) for a period longer than Tlow, the reset_n is re-asserted. If the supply dip is shorter (eg. t4 to t5) the internal reset is not a sserted. This means that \nvoltage drops less than Tlow must be avoided in the system.Fig 7.

The device can exist in one of \nthe three different states as described below:\n•Active state  when the device is fully operational.\n•Low-power state  when DP source issues AUX SET_POWER command on DPCD \nregister 00600h. In this state, AUX and HPD circuits are operational but the main \nDP Link and LVDS Bus are put to high-impe dance condition. The device will transition \nback to Active state when the DP source sets the corresponding DPCD register bits to \n‘DisplayPort D0/Normal Op eration mode’. The I2C-bus interface will not be \noperational in this state.\n•Deep power-saving state : In this state PTN3460I is put to ultra low-power condition. \nThis is effected when PD_N is LOW. To get  back to Active state, PD_N must be made \nHIGH. The external interfaces (like I2C, AUX, DP, LVDS, configuration pins) will not be \noperational.\n8.3.11 Register interface — control and programmability\nPTN3460I has a register interface that can be accessed by CPU/GPU or System \nController to choose settings suitably for the System application needs. The registers can \nbe read/written either via DP AUX or I2C-bus interface. It is left to system integrator choice \nto use an interface to configure PTN3460I.\nPTN3460I provides greater le vel of configurability of cert ain parameters (e.g., LVDS \noutput swing, spreading depth, etc.) via regi sters beyond what is available through pins. \nThe register settings override the pin valu es. All registers must be configured during \npower-on initialization after HPDRX is HI GH. The registers and bit definitions are \ndescribed in “I2C-bus utility and progra mming guide for firmware and EDID update”Fig 8.

To support \nseamless functioning of panels without EDID ROM, the PTN3460I can be programmed to \nemulate EDID ROM and delivers internally stor ed EDID information to the source. Given \nthat EDID is specific to pa nels, PTN3460I enables system integrator to program EDID \ninformation into embedded memory through DP AUX and I2C-bus interfaces. The \nsupported EDID ROM emulation size is 896 byt es (seven EDID data structures, each of \n128 bytes).\nEDID ROM emulation bit is programmed in the configuration table inside the flash \nmemory. It can also be configured through pin setting. FW will read in the pin settings and \noverwrite the configuration table settings.

In all cases seen in measurement this delay is actually much shorter.\n[2] This is a firmware deadline and the typi cal value can change with a FW update. The max timing has to be respected and checke d at any \nFW update.\n[3] This delay is also defined by firmware. The FW polls for DP_N pin state at periods close to 50 ms and this makes the respons e fluctuate.\n[4] Based on worst-case measurements starting the regulator after V DD(3V3)  is 3.0 V. In practical case the regulator starts at much lower \nsupply level and this value can be considered  0 if input supply has rise time > 1 ms.Table 23.

Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n15.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not \nsuitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n15.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n15.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhe sive and flux, clinching of leads, board \ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are \nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\nPTN3460I All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2016.

It is imperative that the peak temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 29\n and 30\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 17 .Table 29.
