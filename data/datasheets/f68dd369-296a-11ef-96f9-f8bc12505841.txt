This\ndevice features an advanced circuit design that provides an ult ra\nlow active current. Ultra low active current is ideal for provi ding\nMore Battery Life \uf0e4 (MoBL®) in portable applications such as\ncellular telephones. The device also has an automatic power\ndown feature that reduces pow er consumption by 99 percent\nwhen addresses are not toggling. Place the device in standby\nmode when deselected (CE1 HIGH or CE2 LOW or both BHE  and\nBLE are HIGH). The input and output pins (I/O0 through I/O15)\nare placed in a high-impedance state when: the device is\ndeselected (CE1 HIGH or CE2 LOW), outputs are disabled (OE\nHIGH), both Byte High Enable and Byte Low Enable are disabled\n(BHE , BLE  HIGH), or a write operation is in progress (CE1 LOW,\nCE2 HIGH and WE  LOW).\nTo write to the device, take Chip Enables (CE1 LOW and CE2\nHIGH) and Write Enable (WE ) input LOW. If Byte Low Enable\n(BLE ) is LOW, then data from I/O pins (I/O0 through I/O7) is\nwritten into the location specified on the address pins (A0 through\nA19). If Byte High Enable (BHE ) is LOW, then data from the I/O\npins (I/O8 through I/O15) is written into the location specified on\nthe address pins (A0 through A19).\nTo read from the device , take Chip Enables (CE1 LOW and CE2\nHIGH) and Output Enable (OE ) LOW while forcing the Write\nEnable (WE ) HIGH. If Byte Low Enable (BLE ) is LOW, then data\nfrom the memory location specified by the address pins appearson I/O\n0 to I/O7. If Byte High Enable (BHE ) is LOW, then data from\nmemory appears on I/O8 to I/O15.
