An F-RAM is nonvolatile and\nperforms reads and writes similar  to a RAM. It provides reliabl e\ndata retention for 151 years while eliminating the complexities ,\noverhead, and system-level reliab ility problems caused by seria l\nflash, EEPROM, and other n onvolatile memories. \nUnlike serial flash and EEPROM, the FM25V02A performs write\noperations at bus speed. No write delays are incurred. Data iswritten to the memory array immediately after each byte is\nsuccessfully transferred to the device. The next bus cycle can\ncommence without the need for data polling. In addition, theproduct offers substantial write endurance compared with other\nnonvolatile memories. The FM25V02A is capable of supporting\n10\n14 read/write cycles, or 100 million times more write cycles\nthan EEPROM. \nThese capabilities make the FM25V02A ideal for nonvolatile\nmemory applications requiring frequent or rapid writes.\nExamples range from data logg ing, where the number of write\ncycles may be critical, to demandi ng industrial controls where the\nlong write time of serial flash  or EEPROM can cause data loss. \nThe FM25V02A provides substantial benefits to users of serial\nEEPROM or flash as a hardware drop-in replacement. TheFM25V02A uses the high-speed SPI bus, which enhances the\nhigh-speed write capability of F-RAM technology. The device\nincorporates a read-only Device ID that allows the host todetermine the manufacturer, product density, and product\nrevision. The device specific ations are guaranteed over an\nindustrial range of –40 \uf0b0C to +85 \uf0b0C.\nFor a complete list of related resources, click here .\nLogic Block Diagram\nInstruction Decoder\nClock Generator\nControl Logic\nWrite Protect\nInstruction Register\nAddress Register  \nCounter32 K x 8        \nF-RAM Array\n15\nData  I/   O Register8\nNonvolatile Status\nRegister3WP\nCS\nHOLD\nSCK\nSO SI\nDocument Number: 001-90865 Rev. *I Page 2 of 24FM25V02A\nContents\nPinouts ....................................................... .......................3\nPin Definitions ............................................... ...................3\nFunctional Overview ........................................... .............4\nMemory Architecture ........................................... .............4\nSerial Peripheral Interface - SPI Bus ......................... .....4\nSPI Overview .................................................. .............4\nSPI Modes ..................................................... ..............5\nPower-Up to First Access ...................................... ......6\nCommand Structure ............................................. .......6\nWREN - Set Write Enable Latch  .......... ........... ............ 6\nWRDI - Reset Write Enable Lat ch ............................... 6\nStatus Register and Write Protection .......................... ...7\nRDSR - Read Status Register ................................... ..7\nWRSR - Write Status Register  .................................. ..7\nMemory Operation .............................................. ..............8\nWrite Operation ............................................... ............8\nRead Operation ................................................ ...........8\nFast Read Operation ........................................... ........8\nHOLD Pin Operation ............................................ .....10\nSleep Mode .................................................... ...........10\nDevice ID ..................................................... ..............11\nEndurance ..................................................... ............12Maximum Ratings ............................................... ............ 13\nOperating Range ............................................... .............. 13\nDC Electrical Characteristi cs ................................. ....... 13\nData Retention and Endurance .................................. ... 14\nCapacitance ................................................... ................. 14\nThermal Resistance ............................................ ............ 14\nAC Test Conditions ............................................ ............ 14\nAC Switching Characteristics .................................. ..... 15\nPower Cycle Timing ............................................ ........... 17\nOrdering Information .......................................... ............ 18\nOrdering Code Definitions ..................................... .... 18\nPackage Diagrams .............................................. ............ 19\nAcronyms ...................................................... .................. 21\nDocument Conventions .......................................... ....... 21\nUnits of Measure .............................................. ......... 21\nDocument History Page ......................................... ........ 22\nSales, Solutions, and Legal Information ...................... 2 4\nWorldwide Sales and Design S upport ......... .............. 24\nProducts ...................................................... .............. 24\nPSoC® Solutions ............................................... ....... 24\nCypress Developer Community . ................................ 24\nTechnical Support ........... .................................. ........ 24\nDocument Number: 001-90865 Rev. *I Page 3 of 24FM25V02A\nPinouts\nFigure 1.  8-pin SOIC Pinout\nFigure 2.  8-pin DFN Pinout\nPin Definitions\nPin Name I/O Type Description\nSCK Input Serial Clock .

The memory array is\nlogically organized as 32,768 × 8 bits and is accessed using anindustry-standard serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus. The\nfunctional operation of the F-RAM is similar to serial flash an d\nserial EEPROMs. The major dif ference between the FM25V02A\nand a serial flash or EEPROM with the same pinout is the\nF-RAM's superior write performance, high endurance, and lowpower consumption. \nMemory Architecture\nWhen accessing the FM25V02A, the user addresses 32Klocations of eight data bits each. These eight data bits are sh ifted\nin or out serially. The addresses are accessed using the SPI\nprotocol, which includes a chip select (to permit multiple devi ces\non the bus), an opcode, and a two-byte address. The upper bit\nof the address range is ‘don’t care’ value. The complete addres s\nof 15 bits specifies each  byte address uniquely. \nMost functions of the FM25V02A  are either controlled by the SPI\ninterface or are handled by on-board circuitry. The access time\nfor the memory operation is ess entially zero, beyond the time\nneeded for the serial protocol. That is, the memory is read orwritten at the speed of the SPI bus. Unlike a serial flash or\nEEPROM, it is not necessary to poll the device for a ready\ncondition because writes occur at bus speed. By the time a newbus transaction can be shifted into the device, a write operati on\nis complete. This is explained in more detail in Memory\nOperation on page 8 . \nSerial Peripheral Interface - SPI Bus\nThe FM25V02A is a SPI slave device and operates at speeds up\nto 40 MHz. This high-speed serial bus provides high-perfor-mance serial communication to a SPI master. Many common\nmicrocontrollers have hardware SPI ports allowing a direct\ninterface. It is quite simple to emulate the port using ordinar y port\npins for microcontrollers that do not. The FM25V02A operates in\nSPI Mode 0 and 3. \nSPI Overview\nThe SPI is a four-pin interface with Chip Select (CS ), Serial Input\n(SI), Serial Output (SO), a nd Serial Clock (SCK) pins. \nThe SPI is a synchronous serial interface, which uses clock and\ndata pins for memory access and supports multiple devices onthe data bus. A device on the SP I bus is activate d using the CS\npin. \nThe relationship between chip select, clock, and data is dictat ed\nby the SPI mode. This device supports SPI modes 0 and 3. In\nboth of these modes, data is clocked into the F-RAM on the risi ng\nedge of SCK starting from the first rising edge after CS  goes\nactive. \nThe SPI protocol is controlled by opcodes. These opcodes\nspecify the commands from the bus master to the slave device.\nAfter CS  i s  a c t i v a t e d ,  t h e  f i r s t  b yte transferred from the busmaster is the opcode. Followin g the opcode, any addresses and\ndata are then transferred. The CS  must go inactive after an\noperation is complete and before a new opcode can be issued.\nThe commonly used terms in the SPI protocol are as follows:\nSPI Master\nThe SPI master device controls the operations on a SPI bus. An\nSPI bus may have only one master with one or more slave\ndevices. All the slaves share the same SPI bus lines and the\nmaster may select any of the slave devices using the CS  pin. All\nof the operations must be initiated by the master activating a\nslave device by pulling the CS  pin of the slave LOW. The master\nalso generates the SCK and all the data transmission on SI and\nSO lines are synchroni zed with this clock. \nSPI Slave\nThe SPI slave device is activated  by the master through the Chi p\nSelect line. A slave device gets the SCK as an input from the S PI\nmaster and all the communicat ion is synchronized with this\nclock. An SPI slave never initiates a communication on the SPI\nbus and acts only on the inst ruction from the master.\nThe FM25V02A operates as an SPI slave and may share the SPI\nbus with other SPI slave devices. \nChip Select (CS )\nTo select any slave device, the master needs to pull down the\ncorresponding CS  pin. Any instruction can be issued to a slave\ndevice only while the CS  pin is LOW. When the device is not\nselected, data through the SI pin is ignored and the serial out put\npin (SO) remains in a high-impedance state.\nNote  A new instruction must begin with the falling edge of CS .\nTherefore, only one opcode can be issued for each active Chip\nSelect cycle.\nSerial Clock (SCK)\nThe serial clock is generated by the SPI master and the\ncommunication is synchronized with this clock after CS  goes\nLOW.\nThe FM25V02A enables SPI modes 0 and 3 for data communi-\ncation. In both of these modes, the inputs are latched by the\nslave device on the rising edge of SCK and outputs are issued\non the falling edge. Therefore, the first rising edge of SCK\nsignifies the arrival of the first bit (MSB) of a SPI instructi on on\nthe SI pin. Further, all data in puts and outputs are synchroniz ed\nwith SCK.\nData Transmission (SI/SO)\nThe SPI data bus consists of two lines, SI and SO, for serial d ata\ncom munication.  SI is also referred to as M ast er  Out Slave I n\n(MOSI) and SO is referred to as Master In Slave Out (MISO). The\nmaster issues instructions to the slave through the SI pin, whi le\nthe slave responds through the SO pin. Multiple slave devices\nmay share the SI and SO lines as described earlier.\nThe FM25V02A has two separate pins for SI and SO, which can\nbe connected with the master as shown in Figure 3 on page 5 .\nDocument Number: 001-90865 Rev. *I Page 5 of 24FM25V02A\nFor a microcontroller that has no dedicated SPI bus, a\ngeneral-purpose port may be used. To reduce hardwareresources on the controller, it is possible to connect the two data\npins (SI, SO) together and tie off (HIGH) the HOLD\n and WP  pins.\nFigure 4  shows such a configuration,  which uses only three pins.\nMost Significant Bit (MSB)\nThe SPI protocol requires that the first bit to be transmitted is the\nMost Significant Bit (MSB). This is valid for both address and\ndata transmission. \nThe 256-Kbit serial F-RAM requires a 2-byte address for any\nread or write operation. Because the address is only 15 bits, t he\nupper bit which is fed in is igno red by the device. Although th e\nupper bit is ‘don’t care’, Cypress recommends that these bits b e\nset to 0s to enable seamless transition to higher memory\ndensities.Serial Opcode\nAfter the slave device  is selected with CS  going LOW, the first\nbyte received is treated as the opcode for the intended operati on.\nFM25V02A uses the standard opcodes for memory accesses.\nInvalid Opcode\nIf an invalid opcode is received, the opcode is ignored and the\ndevice ignores any additional serial data on the SI pin until t he\nnext falling edge of CS , and the SO pin remains tristated.\nStatus Register\nFM25V02A has an 8-bit Status Register. The bits in the Status\nRegister are used to configure the device. These bits aredescribed in Table 3 on page 7 .\nSPI Modes\nFM25V02A may be driven by a microcontroller with its SPI\nperipheral running in either  of the following two modes:\n■SPI Mode 0 (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0)\n■SPI Mode 3 (CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1)\nFor both these modes, the input data is latched in on the risin g\nedge of SCK starting from the first rising edge after CS  goesactive. If the clock starts from a HIGH state (in mode 3), the first\nrising edge after the clock toggl es is considered. The output d ata\nis available on the falling edge of SCK.The two SPI modes are\nshown in Figure 5 on page 6  and Figure 6 on page 6 . The status\nof the clock when the bus maste r is not transferring data is:\n■SCK remains at 0 for Mode 0 \n■SCK remains at 1 for Mode 3 Figure 3.

If the\nSCK pin is LOW when the device is selected, SPI Mode 0 is\nassumed and if the SCK pin is HIGH, it works in SPI Mode 3.\nPower-Up to First Access\nThe FM25V02A is not accessible for a tPU time after power-up.\nUsers must comply with the timing parameter tPU, which is the\nminimum time from VDD (min) to the first CS  LOW. \nCommand Structure\nThere are nine commands, called opcodes, that can be issuedby the bus master to the FM25V02A. They are listed in Table 1 .\nThese opcodes control the func tions performed by the memory.WREN - Set Write Enable Latch\nThe FM25V02A will power up with writes disabled. The WREN\ncommand must be issued before any write operation. Sendingthe WREN opcode allows the user to issue subsequent opcodes\nfor write operations. These incl ude writing the Status Register\n(WRSR) and writing the memory (WRITE). \nSending the WREN opcode causes the internal Write Enable\nLatch to be set. A flag bit in the Status Register, called WEL,\nindicates the state of the latch.  WEL = ‘1’ indicates that writ es are\npermitted. Attempting to write the WEL bit in the Status Regist er\nhas no effect on the state of this bit - only the WREN opcode c an\nset this bit. The WEL bit will be automatically cleared on the rising\nedge of CS\n following a WRDI, a WRSR, or a WRITE operation.\nThis prevents further writes to the Status Register or the F-RA M\narray without another WREN command. Figure 7  illustrates the\nWREN command bus configuration.\nWRDI - Reset Write Enable Latch\nThe WRDI command disables all write activity by clearing the\nWrite Enable Latch. T he user can verify that  writes are disable d\nby reading the WEL bit in the Status Register and verifying tha t\nWEL is equal to ‘0’. Figure 8  illustrates the WRDI command bus\nconfiguration.Figure 5.  SPI Mode 0\nFigure 6.  SPI Mode 3\nTable 1.

The status registe r is\norganized as follows (the defaul t value shipped from the factor y for bits in the status register is ‘0’):\nBits 0 and 4–6 are fixed at ‘0’; none of these bits can be modi fied.\nNote that bit 0 (“Ready or Write in progress” bit in serial fla sh and\nEEPROM) is unnecessary, as the F-RAM writes in real-time and\nis never busy, so it reads out as a ‘0’. An exception to this i s when\nthe device is waking up from sleep mode, which is described inSleep Mode on page 10 . The BP1 and BP0 control the software\nwrite-protection features and are nonvolatile bits. The WEL fla g\nindicates the state of the Write Enable Latch. Attempting todirectly write the WEL bit in the Status Register has no effect  on\nits state. This bit is internally set and cleared via the WREN and\nWRDI commands, respectively. \nBP1 and BP0 are memory block write protection bits. They\nspecify portions of m emory that are write-protected as shown in\nTable 4 .\nThe BP1 and BP0 bits and the Write Enable Latch are the only\nmechanisms that protect the memo ry from writes. The remaining\nwrite protection features protect inadvertent changes to the bl ock\nprotect bits. \nThe write protect enable bit (WPEN) in the Status Register\ncontrols the effect of the hardware write protect (WP\n) pin. When\nthe WPEN bit is set to ‘0’, the status of the WP  pin is ignored.\nWhen the WPEN bit is set to ‘1’, a LOW on the WP  pin inhibits awrite to the Status Register. Thus the Status Register is\nwrite-protected only when WPEN = ‘1’ and WP  = ‘0’. \nTable 5  summarizes the write protection conditions.\nRDSR - Read Status Register\nThe RDSR command allows the bus master to verify the\ncontents of the Status Register. Reading the status register\nprovides information about the current state of the\nwrite-protection features. Fo llowing the RDSR opcode, the\nFM25V02A will return one byte with the contents of the Status\nRegister. \nWRSR - Write Status Register\nThe WRSR command allows the SPI bus master to write into theStatus Register and change the write protect configuration by\nsetting the WPEN, BP0, and BP1 bits as required. Prior to\nissuing a WRSR command, the WP\n p i n  m u s t  b e  H I G H  o r\ninactive. Note that on the FM25V02A, WP  only prevents writing\nto the Status Register, not the memory array. Before sending th e\nWRSR command, the user must send a WREN command to\nenable writes. Executing a WRSR command is a write operationand therefore, clears the Write Enable Latch.Table 2.

No page register is needed and\nany number of sequential writes may be performed. \nWrite Operation\nAll writes to the memory begin with a WREN opcode with CS\nbeing asserted and deasserted. The next opcode is WRITE. TheWRITE opcode is followed by a two-byte address containing the\n15-bit address (A14–A0) of the first data byte to be written in to\nthe memory. The upper bit of the two-byte address is ignored.Subsequent bytes are data bytes,  which are written sequentially .\nAddresses are incremented internally as long as the bus master\ncontinues to issue clocks and keeps CS\n LOW. If the last address\nof 7FFFh is reached, the counter will roll over to 0000h. Data is\nwritten MSB first. The rising edge of CS  terminates a write\noperation. A write operation is shown in Figure 11 on page 9 .\nNote  When a burst write reaches a protected block address, the\nautomatic address incr ement stops and all the subsequent data\nbytes received for  write will be ignored by the device.\nEEPROMs use page buffers to increase their write throughput.\nThis compensates for the technology’s inherently slow write\noperations. F-RAM memories do not have page buffers because\neach byte is written to the F-RAM array immediately after it isclocked in (after the eighth clock). This allows any number of\nbytes to be written wit hout page buffer delays.\nNote  If the power is lost in the middle of the write operation, onl y\nthe last completed byte will be written.\nRead Operation\nAfter the falling edge of CS , the bus master can issue a READ\nopcode. Following the READ command is a two-byte address\ncontaining the 15-bit address (A14–A0) of the first byte of the\nread operation. The upper bit o f the address is ignored. After the\nopcode and address are issued, the device drives out the read\ndata on the next eight clocks. T he SI input is ignored during r ead\ndata bytes. Subsequent bytes are data bytes, which are read outsequentially. Addresses are incremented internally as long as\nthe bus master continues to issue clocks and CS\n is LOW. If the\nlast address of 7FFFh is reached,  the counter will roll over to\n0000h. Data is read MSB first. The rising edge of CS  terminates\na read operation and tristates the SO pin. A read operation is\nshown in  Figure 12 on page 9 .\nFast Read Operation\nThe FM25V02A supports a FAST READ opcode (0Bh) that is\nprovided for code compatibility with serial flash devices. The\nFAST READ opcode is followed by a two-byte address\ncontaining the 15-bit address (A14–A0) of the first byte of theread operation and then a dummy byte. The dummy byte inserts\na read latency of an 8-clock cycle. The fast read operation isFigure 9.  RDSR Bu s Configuration\nFigure 10.

After receiving the opcode,address, and a dummy byte, the FM25V02A starts driving its SO\nline with data bytes, with the MS B first, and continues trans-\nmitting as long as the device is selected and the clock is\navailable. In case of bulk read, the internal address counter i sincremented automatic ally, and after the last address 7FFFh is\nreached, the counter rolls over to 0000h. When the device isdriving data on its SO line, any transition on its SI line is i gnored.\nThe rising edge of CS\n terminates a fast read operation and\ntristates the SO pin.

If the bus master pulls the HOLD  pin LOW while SCK\nis LOW, the current operation will pause. Taking the HOLD  pinHIGH while SCK is LOW will resume an operation. The\ntransitions of HOLD  must occur while SCK is LOW, but the SCK\nand CS  pin can toggle dur ing a hold state.\nSleep Mode\nA low-power sleep mode is implemented on the FM25V02A\ndevice. The device will enter the low-power state when theSLEEP opcode B9h is clocked-in  and a rising edge of CS\n i s\napplied. When in sleep mode, the SCK and SI pins are ignored\nand SO will be HI-Z, but the de vice continues to monitor the CSpin. On the next falling edge of CS , the device will return to\nnormal operation within tREC time. The SO pin remains in a HI-Z\nstate during the wakeup period.  The device does not necessarily\nrespond to an opcode within the wakeup period. To start the\nwakeup procedure, the controller may send a “dummy” read, forexample, and wait the remaining t\nREC time.Figure 14.

An F-RAM memory operates with a\nread and restore mechanism. Therefore, an endurance cycle is\napplied on a row basis for each access (read or write) to the\nmemory array. The F-RAM architecture is based on an array of\nrows and columns of 4K rows of 64-bits each. The entire row is\ninternally accessed once whether a single byte or all eight byt es\nare read or written. Each byte in the row is counted only once in\nan endurance calculation. Table 7  shows endurance calculations\nfor a 64-byte repeating loop, which includes an opcode, a start ing\naddress, and a sequential 64-byte data stream. This causes\neach byte to experience one en durance cycle through the loop. Table 7.
