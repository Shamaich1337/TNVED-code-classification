The device accepts \ndifferential input data and provides bias and modulation \ncurrents for driving a laser. DC-coupling to the laser allows \nfor multirate applications and reduces the number of exter -\nnal components. The MAX3735A is fully compliant with the \nSFP MSA timing and the SFF-8472 transmit diagnostic \nrequirements.\nAn automatic power-control (APC) feedback loop is incor -\nporated to maintain a constant average optical power over \ntemperature and lifetime. The wide modulation current \nrange of 10mA to 60mA (up to 85mA AC-coupled) and bias \ncurrent of 1mA to 100mA make this product ideal for driving \nFP/DFB laser diodes in fiber-optic modules. The resistor \nrange for the laser current settings is optimized to interface \nwith the DS1858 SFP controller IC.\nThe MAX3735A provides transmit-disable control, a \nsingle-point latched transmit-failure monitor output, photo -\ncurrent monitoring, and bias-current monitoring to indicate \nwhen the APC loop is unable to maintain the average \noptical power.\nThe MAX3735A is available in a 4mm x 4mm TQFN pack -\nage and operates over the extended temperature range of \n-40°C to +85°C.\nApplications\n ●Gigabit Ethernet SFP/SFF Transceiver Modules\n ●1G/2G Fibre Channel SFP/SFF Transceiver Modules\n ●Multirate OC3 to OC48-FEC SFP/SFF Transceiver  \n ModulesFeatures\n ●Fully Compliant with SFP and SFF-8472 MSAs\n ●Programmable Modulation Current from 10mA to \n60mA (DC-Coupled)\n ●Programmable Modulation Current from 10mA to \n85mA (AC-Coupled)\n ●Programmable Bias Current from 1mA to 100mA\n ●Edge Transition Times <51ps\n ●27mA (typ) Power-Supply Current\n ●Multirate 155Mbps to 2.7Gbps Operation\n ●Automatic Average Power Control\n ●On-Chip Pullup Resistor for TX_DISABLE\n ●24-Pin 4mm x 4mm TQFN package\n19-2529; Rev 4; 1/13Ordering Information  appears at end of data sheet.\nIN+0.1µF\nGNDMODSET\nAPCSET\nAPCFILT2APCFILT1\nSHUTDOWNTX_FAULTTX_DISABLE\nBC_MON\nPC_MONMDBIASOUT+\nOUT+OUT-OPTIONAL SHUTDOWN\nCIRCUITRYVCC\nIN-\nREPRESENTS A CONTROLLED-IMPEDANCE TRANSMISSION LINESERDESMAX3735A0.1µF+3.3V+3.3V\nCMDFERRITE BEAD+3.3V\n10Ω\nRBC_MON\nRPC_MON15Ω0.01µF\nDS1858/DS1859\nCONTROLLER\nICCAPC\nM0N2\nM0N3MON1H1H0\n+3.3V\nMAX3735A 2.7Gbps, Low-Power SFP Laser DriverTypical Application CircuitEVALUATION KIT AVAILABLE\nSupply Voltage, V CC ............................................ -0.5V to +6.0V\nCurrent into BIAS, OUT+, OUT-  ..................... -20mA to +150mA\nCurrent into MD  .................................................... -5mA to +5mA\nVoltage at IN+, IN-, TX_DISABLE, TX_FAULT,  \nSHUTDOWN ......................................... -0.5V to (V CC + 0.5V)\nVoltage at BIAS, PC_MON, BC_MON,  \nMODSET, APCSET  .............................. -0.5V to (V CC + 0.5V)\nVoltage at OUT+, OUT-  ........................... +0.5V to (V CC + 1.5V)\nVoltage at APCFILT1, APCFILT2  ............................. -0.5V to +3VContinuous Power Dissipation (T A = +70°C )  \n24-Lead Thin QFN (derate 27.8mW/°C  \nabove +70°C)  ............................................................ 2222mW\nOperating Ambient Temperature Range (T A) .....-40°C to +85°C\nStorage Ambient Temperature Range  .............. -55°C to +150°C\nDie Attach Temperature  ................................................... +400°C\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s)  ................................. +300°C\nPACKAGE TYPE: 24-PIN TQFN\nPackage Code T2444+3\nOutline Number 21-0139\nLand Pattern Number 90-0021\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 2\nMAX3735A 2.7Gbps, Low-Power SFP Laser DriverAbsolute Maximum Ratings\nStresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device.

The circuit design is optimized for \nhigh-speed and low-voltage (+3.3V) operation.\nHigh-Speed Modulation Driver\nThe output stage is composed of a high-speed differen -\ntial pair and a programmable modulation current source. \nThe MAX3735A is optimized for driving a 15Ω load; the \nminimum instantaneous voltage required at OUT+ is \n0.6V. Modulation current swings up to 60mA are possible \nwhen the laser diode is DC-coupled to the driver and up \nto 85mA when the laser diode is AC-coupled to the driver.To interface with the laser diode, a damping resistor (R D) \nis required for impedance matching. The combined resis -\ntance of the series damping resistor and the equivalent \nseries resistance of the laser diode should equal 15Ω. To \nreduce optical output aberrations and duty-cycle distortion \ncaused by laser diode parasitic inductance, an RC shunt \nnetwork might be necessary. Refer to Maxim Application \nNote HFAN 02.0: Interfacing Maxim’s Laser Drivers to \nLaser Diodes  for more information.\nAt data rates of 2.7Gbps, any capacitive load at the cath -\node of a laser diode degrades optical output performance. \nBecause the BIAS output is directly connected to the laser \ncathode, minimize the parasitic capacitance associated \nwith the pin by using an inductor to isolate the BIAS pin \nparasitics from the laser cathode.PIN NAME FUNCTION\n1, 4, 8, 14, 18 VCC +3.3V Supply Voltage \n2 IN+ Noninverted Data Input\n3 IN- Inverted Data Input\n5 PC_MONPhotodiode Current Monitor Output.

A back-facet photodiode mounted in the laser \npackage is used to convert the optical power into a pho -\ntocurrent. The APC loop adjusts the laser bias current so \nthat the monitor current is matched to a reference current \nset by R APCSET . The time constant of the APC loop is \ndetermined by an external capacitor (C APC). For possible \nCAPC values, see the Applications Information  section.\nSafety Circuitry\nThe safety circuitry contains an input disable (TX_\nDISABLE), a latched fault output (TX_FAULT), and fault \ndetectors ( Figure 4 ). This circuitry monitors the opera -\ntion of the laser driver and forces a shutdown if a fault is \ndetected ( Table 1 ). A single-point fault can be a short to \nVCC or GND. See Table 2  to view the circuit response to various single-point failures. The transmit fault condition \nis latched until reset by a toggle of TX_DISABLE or V CC. \nThe laser driver offers redundant laser diode shutdown \nthrough the optional shutdown circuitry (see the Typical \nApplications Circuit ). The TX_FAULT pin should be pulled \nhigh with a 4.7kΩ to 10kΩ resistor to V CC as required by \nthe SFP MSA.\nSafety Circuitry Current Monitors\nThe MAX3735A features monitors (BC_MON, PC_MON) \nfor bias current (I BIAS) and photo current (I MD). The moni -\ntors are realized by mirroring a fraction of the currents and \ndeveloping voltages across external resistors connected \nto ground. Voltages greater than 1.38V at PC_MON or \nBC_MON result in a fault state. For example, connecting \na 100Ω resistor to ground on each monitor output gives \nthe following relationships:\nVBC_MON  = (IBIAS / 76) x 100Ω\nVPC_MON  = IMD x 100ΩFunctional Diagram\nVCC\nVCCIAPCSET\nCAPCIBIASIMODRD\nIMDRAPCSETx38VCC\nRPC_MONPC_MON100Ω\nIN-IN+\nIMOD\nENABLEIBIAS\nENABLEINPUT BUFFERSHUTDOWN\nDATA\nPATH\nX270\nSAFETY LOGIC\nAND\nPOWER\nDETECTOR\nTX_FAULTCMD\nTX_DISABLEAPCFILT1 APCFILT2\nSHUTDOWNMODSETBC_MON\nx176IBIAS1IMD\nAPCSET\nMDMAX3735A\nVCC\nVBG\n(4.7kΩ\nTO 10kΩ)RBC_MONVCC\nVBG\nRMODSETVCC\nOUT-\nOUT+\nBIASVCC\n15Ω\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 12\nMAX3735A 2.7Gbps, Low-Power SFP Laser Driver\nDesign Procedure\nWhen designing a laser transmitter, the optical output usu -\nally is expressed in terms of average power and extinction \nratio. Table 3  shows relationships helpful in converting \nbetween the optical average power and the modulation \ncurrent. These relationships are valid if the mark density \nand duty cycle of the optical waveform are 50%.\nProgramming the Modulation Current\nFor a given laser power (P AVG), slope efficiency (η), \nand extinction ratio (r e), the modulation current can be \ncalculated using Table 3 .

Additionally, the MAX3735A out -\nputs are optimized for a 15Ω load. Therefore, the series \ncombination of R D and R L, where R L represents the \nlaser-diode resistance, should equal 15Ω. Typical values \nfor R D are 8Ω to 13Ω. For best performance, place a \nbypass capacitor (0.01μF typ) as close as possible to the \nanode of the laser diode. An RC shunt network between \nthe laser cathode and ground minimizes optical output \naberrations. Starting values for most coaxial lasers are \nRCOMP  = 50Ω in series with C COMP  = 8pF. Adjust these \nvalues experimentally until the optical output waveform is \noptimized.

The Monitor Diode vs. R APCSET \ngraph in the Typical Operating Characteristics  section \nshows that R APCSET  should be 3kΩ. The value can also \nbe estimated using the equation below:\nIMD = 1.23 / (2 x R APCSET )\nDetermine R MODSET\nTo achieve a minimum extinction ratio (r e) of 6.6 over \ntemperature and lifetime, calculate the required extinction \nratio at +25°C. Assuming the results of the calculation are \nre = 20 at +25°C, the peak-to-peak optical power P P-P \n= 1.81mW, according to Table 3 . The required modula -\ntion current is 1.81mW / (0.05mW/mA) = 36.2mA. The \nModulation Current vs. R MODSET  graph in the Typical \nOperating Characteristics  section shows that R MODSET \nshould be 9.5kΩ. The value can also be estimated using \nthe equation below:\nIMOD  = 1.23 / (0.0037 x R MODSET )\nDetermine C APC\nIn order to meet SFP timing requirements and minimize \npattern-dependent jitter, the C APC capacitor value is \ndetermined by the laser-to-monitor transfer and other \nvariables. The following equations and Table 4  can be \nused to choose the C APC values for the MAX3735A. The \nequations and Table 4  assume a DC-coupled laser.

Such a configuration isolates laser forward \nvoltage from the output circuitry and allows the output at \nOUT+ to swing above and below the supply voltage (V CC).
