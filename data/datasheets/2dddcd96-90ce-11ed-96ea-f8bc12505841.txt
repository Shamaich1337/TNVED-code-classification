The ADM2682E /ADM2687E  \ninclude an integrated  5 kV  rms isolated dc-to-dc power supply \nthat eliminates the need for an external dc -to-dc isolation block.  \nThey are  designed for balanced transmissi on lines and compl y \nwith ANSI/ TIA/EIA -485- A-98 and ISO  8482:1987(E).  \nThe device s integrate  Analog Devices, Inc.,  iCoupler ® technology to \ncombine a 3 -channel isolator, a three -state differential line driver,  a \ndifferential input receiver , and Analog Devices isoPower ® dc-to-dc \nconverter  into a single package. The device s are powered by a \nsingle 5  V or 3.3  V supply , realizing a fully integrated  signal and \npower  isolated RS -485 solution.  The ADM2682E/ ADM268 7E driver s have an active high enable.  \nAn active low receiver enable is also provided, which causes the \nreceiver output to enter a high impedance state when disabled.  \nThe device s have current limiting and thermal shutdown \nfeatures to protect against outpu t short circuits and situations \nwhere bus contention m ay cause excessive power dissipation. \nThe part s are fully specified over the industrial temperature \nrange and are  available in a highly integrated, 1 6-lead, wide -\nbody  SOIC package  with >8 mm creepage  and clearance . \nThe ADM2682E /ADM2687E  contain isoPower technology that  \nuses high frequency switching elements to transfer  power through  \nthe transformer. Special care must be taken  during printed circuit  \nboard (PCB) layout to meet emissions  standards. Refer to  \nAN-0971 Application Note , Recommendations for  Control of \nRadiated Emissions with iso Power Devices , for details on board \nlayout considerations.  \n \nADM2682E/ADM2687E Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 16 of 24 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nSIGNAL ISOLATION  \nThe ADM2682E /ADM2687E  signal isolation  of 5 kV  rms is \nimplemented on the logic side of the interface. The part achieves  \nsignal isolation by having a digital isolation section and  a trans -\nceiver section (see Figure 1). Data  applied to the T xD and DE \npins a nd referenced to logic ground (GND 1) are coupled across \nan isolation barrier to appear at the transceiver section referenced  \nto isolated ground (GND 2). Similarly, the single -ended receiver \noutput  signal, referenced to isolated ground in the transceiver  \nsection, is coupled across the isolation barrier to appear at the \nRxD pin referenced to logic ground.  \nPOWER ISOLATION  \nThe ADM2682E /ADM2687E  powe r isolation  of 5 kV  rms is \nimplemented using an isoPower integrated isolated dc -to-dc \nconverter.  The dc -to-dc converter section of the ADM2682E / \nADM2687E  works on principles that are common to most \nmodern power supplies. It is a secondary side controller \narchitecture with isolated pulse -width modulation (PWM) \nfeedback. V CC power is supplied to an os cillating circuit that \nswitches current into a chip -scale air core transformer. Power \ntransferred to the secondary side is rectified and regulated to 3.3 V . The secondary (V\nISO) side controller regulates the output \nby creating a PWM control signal that is sent to the primary \n(V CC) side by a dedicated iCoupler (5 kV  rms signal isolated) \ndata channel. The PWM modulates the oscillator circuit to \ncontrol the power being sent to the secondary side. Feedback allows for significantly higher power and efficiency.  \nTRUTH TABLES  \nThe truth tables in this section use the abbreviations found in Table 11. \nTable 11.

Shorting  the driver outputs to a low impedance \nsource can result in high driver currents. The thermal sensing \ncircuitry detects the increase in die temperature under this \ncondition and disables the driver outputs. This circuitry is designed to disable the driver o utputs when a die temperature \nof 150°C is reached. As the device cools, the drivers are reenabled  \nat a temperature of 140°C.  \nOPEN-  AND SHORT -CIRCUIT , FAIL -SAFE RECEIVER \nINPUTS  \nThe receiver inputs have open - and short -circuit , fail-safe feature s \nthat ensure  that the receiver output is high when the inputs are \nopen or shorted. During line -idle conditions, when no driver on \nthe bus is enabled, the voltage across a terminating resistance at \nthe receiver input decays to 0 V . With traditional transceivers, \nreceiv er input thresholds specified between −200 mV and \n+200 mV mean that external bias resistors are required on the \nA and B pins to ensure that the receiver outputs are in a known \nstate. The short -circuit , fail-safe receiver input feature eliminates  \nthe need f or bias resistors by specifying the receiver input threshold  \nbetwee n −30 mV and −200 mV . The guaranteed negative threshold  \nmeans that when the voltage between A and B decays to 0  V,  t h e  \nreceiver output is guaranteed to be high.  \nDC CORRECTNESS AND M AGNETIC FIELD IMMUNITY  \nThe digital signals transmit across the isolation barrier using \niCoupler te chnology. This technique uses chip -scale transformer \nwindings to couple the digital signals magnetically from one \nside of the barrier to the other. Digital inputs are  encoded into \nwaveforms that are capable of exciting the primary transformer winding. At the secondary winding, the induced waveforms are decoded into the binary value that was originally transmitted.  \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator  input cause \nnarrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the transformer.  \nThe decoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by \nthe pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the absence of \nlogic transitions at the input for more th an 1 µ s, periodic sets of \nrefresh pulses indicative of the correct input state are sent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal pulses of more than approximately 5 µ s, the input side \nData Sheet  ADM2682E/ADM2687E \n \nRev. C | Page 17 of 24 is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunc tional, in which case , \nthe isolator output is forced to a default state by the watchdog \ntimer circuit.  \nThis situation should occur in the ADM2682E /ADM2687E devices  \nonly during power -up and power -down operations. The limitation  \non the ADM2682E /ADM2687E  magnetic field immunity is set \nby the condition in which induced voltage in the tran sformer \nreceiving coil is suffi ciently large to either falsely set or reset the \ndecoder. The following analysis defines the conditions under which this can  occur.  \nThe 3.3 V operating condition of the ADM2682E /ADM2687E  \nis examined because it represents the most susceptible mode of \noperation. The pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude  \nof >1.0 V . The decoder has a sensing thres hold of about 0.5 V , \nthus estab lishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can \nbe tolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is \ngiven by  \nV = (− dβ/dt)Σπr\nn2; n = 1, 2, … , N  \nwhere:  \nβ is magnetic flux density (gauss).  \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil.  \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm).  \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADM2682E / \nADM2687E  and an imposed requirement that the induced \nvoltage be, at most, 50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a \nmaximum allo wable magnetic field is calculated as shown in \nFigure 39.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kgauss)\n0.001\n1M10\n0.01\n1k 10k 10M0.11\n100M 100k\n09927-019 \nFigure 39. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density   For example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum allowable magnetic  field of 0.2 kgauss induces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the \nsensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. Similarly, if such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse (and is of the worst -case polari ty), it reduces the received pulse \nfrom >1.0 V to 0.75 V , which is still well above the 0.5 V sensing \nthreshold of the decoder.  \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to specific  \ncurrent magnitudes at given distances from the ADM2682E / \nADM2687E  transformers. Figure 40 expresses these allowable \ncurrent magnitudes as a function of fr equency for selected \ndistances. As shown in Figure 40, the ADM2682E /ADM2687E  \nare extremely i mmune and can be affected only by extremely \nlarge currents operated at high frequency very close to the \ncomponent. For the 1 MHz example, a 0.5 kA current must be \nplaced 5 mm away from the ADM2682E /ADM2687E  to affect \ncomponent operation . \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)1k\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n1k 10k 100M 100k 1M 10MDISTANCE = 5mmDISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 100mm\n09927-020 \nFigure 40.

C | Page 18 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nPCB LAYOUT   \nThe ADM2682E /ADM2687E  isolated RS -422/RS -485 transceiver  \ncontains a n isoPower integrated dc -to-dc converter , requiring \nno external interface circuitry for the logic interfaces. Power \nsupply bypassing is requ ired at the input and output supply pins \n(see Figure 41). The power supply section of the ADM2682E / \nADM2687E  uses a n 180 MHz oscillator frequency to pass pow er \nefficiently through its chip -scale transformers. In addition, the \nnormal operation of the data section of the iCoupler introduces \nswitching transients on the power supply pins.  \nBypass capacitors are required for several operating frequencies. \nNoise suppression requires a low inductance, high frequency capacitor , whereas  ripple suppression and proper regulation \nrequire a large value capacitor. These capacitors  are connected \nbetween Pin 1 (G ND\n1) and Pin 2  (V CC) and Pin 7 (V CC) and \nPin 8 (GND 1) for V CC. The VISOIN and V ISOOUT  capacitors are \nconnected between Pin 9 (GND 2) and Pin 10 (V ISOOUT ) and \nPin 15 (V ISOIN) and Pin 16 (GND 2). To suppress noise and reduce  \nripple, a parallel combination of a t least two capacitors is required  \nwith the smaller of the two capacitors located closest to the device . \nThe recommended capacitor values are 0.1 µ F and 10  µF for \nVISOOUT  at Pin 9 and Pin 10 and V CC at Pin 7 and Pin 8. Capacitor  \nvalues of 0.01 µF and 0.1  µF are recommended for V ISOIN at Pin  15 \nand Pin 16 and V CC at Pin 1 and Pin 2. The recommended best \npractice is to use a very low inductance ceramic capacitor, or its equivalent, for the smaller value  capacitors . The total lead length  \nbetween both ends of t he capacitor and the input power supply \npin should not exceed 10 mm.  \n09927-125GND 1\nVCC\nRxD\nREGND 2\nVISOIN\nA\nB\nDE Z\nTxD Y\nVCC VISOOUT\nGND 1 GND 21\n2\n316\n15\n14\n4 13\n5 12\n6 11\n7 10\n8 9ADM2682 E/\nADM2687 E10nF 10nF\n10µF 10µF100nF 100nF\n100nF 100nF \nFigure 41. Recommended PCB Layout   In applications involving high common -mode transients, ensure  \nthat board coupling across the isolation barrier is minimized . \nFurthermore, design the board layout such that any coupling that does occur equally affects all pins on a given component side. Failure to ensure this can cause voltage differentials between  \npins exceeding the absolute maximum ratings for the device, thereby leading to latch -up and/or permanent damage.  \nThe ADM2682E /ADM2687E  dissipate approximately  675 mW \nof power when f ully loaded. Because it is not possible to apply  \na heat sink to an isolation device, the device s primarily depend \non heat dissipation into the PCB through the GND pins. If the device s are used at high ambient temperatures, provide a thermal  \npath from  the GND pins to the PCB ground plane. The board \nlayout in Figure 41 shows enlarged pads for Pin 1 , Pin 8, Pin 9, \nand Pin 16. Implement multiple  vias from the pad to the ground \nplane to reduce the temperature  inside the chip  significa ntly. The \ndimensions of the expanded pads are at the discretion of the designer and dependent on the available board space.  \nEMI CONSIDERATIONS   \nThe dc -to-dc converter section of the ADM2682E /ADM2687E  \ncomponents must, of necessity, operate at very high frequency to allow efficient power transfer through the small transformers.  \nThis creates high frequency currents that can propagate in circuit \nboard ground and power planes, causing edge and dipole radiation . \nGrounded enclosures are recommended for applications that use these devices. If grounded enclosures are not possible, good RF design practices should b e followed in the layout of the PCB. \nSee the AN-0971 Application Note , Recommendations for  Control  \nof Radiated Emissions with iso Power Devices , for more information.  \n \nData Sheet  ADM2682E/ADM2687E \n \nRev. C | Page 19 of 24 INSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected to \nvoltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of insulation  \ndegradation is dependent on the characteristics of the voltage waveform applied across the insulation. Analog Devices  conducts  \nan extensive set of evaluations to determine the lifetime of the \ninsulation structure within the ADM2682E /ADM 2687E .  \nAccelerated life testing is performed using voltage levels higher \nthan the rated continuous working voltage. Acceleration factors for \nseveral operating conditions are determined, allowing calculation of the time to failure at the working voltage o f interest. The values \nshown in Table 9 summarize the peak voltages for 50  years of \nservice life in several operating conditions. In many cases, the \nworking voltage approved by agency testing is higher than the \n50-year service lif e voltage. Operation at working voltages  higher \nthan the service life voltage listed leads to premature insulation \nfailure.  \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADM2682E /ADM2687E  depends \non the voltage waveform type imposed across the isolation barrier.  \nThe iCoupler insulation structure degrades at different rates, \ndepending on whether the waveform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 42, Figure 43, and Figure 44 illustrate these different  \nisolation voltage waveforms.  \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. A 50 -year \noperating life time under the bipolar ac condition determines \nthe Analog Devices recommended maximum working voltage.  \nIn the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insulation  \nis significantly lower. This allows operation at higher working \nvoltages while st ill achieving a 50 -year service life. The working \nvoltages listed in Table 9 can be applied while maintaining the \n50-year minimum lifetime, provided the voltage conform s to either  the unipolar ac or dc voltage cases. Any cross- insulation vo ltage \nwaveform that does not conform to Figure 43 or Figure 44 should \nbe treated as a bipolar ac waveform, and its peak voltage should be limited to the 50 -year lifetime voltage value listed in Table 9. \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n09927-021 \nFigure 42.

Up to 256 transceivers can be connected to \nthe RS-485 bus. To minimize reflections, terminate the line at \nthe receiving end in its characteristic impedance and keep stub lengths off the main line as short as possible. For half-duplex operation, this means that both ends of the line must be terminated \nbecause either end can be the receiving end. \n \n \nADM2682E/ADM2687ETxD\nA\nBY\nZ\nDE\nRxD\nRE\nISOLATION\nBARRIERTRANSCEIVER\nGND 1\nGND 1GND 2ENCODE\nENCODEENCODE\nDECODEDECODEDECODE D\nROSCILLATOR RECTIFIER\nREGULATORVISOOUTVCC\nVCC\nVISOIN\nMICROCONTROLLER\nAND UART\nRT3.3V/5V POWER\nSUPPLY\n100nF 10µF 100nF 10nF\n100nF 10µF\n100nF 10nF\nDIGITAL ISOLATION iCouplerisoPower DC-TO-DC CONVERTER\n09927-124 \nFigure 45.

**Description:**
The ADM2682E/ADM2687E is a fully integrated, isolated RS-485/RS-422 transceiver designed for high-speed communication on multipoint transmission lines. It features a 5 kV rms isolation barrier, which allows for safe data transmission in electrically noisy environments. The device incorporates Analog Devices' iCoupler technology, which combines digital isolation with a transceiver in a single package, eliminating the need for external isolation components.

**Typical Applications:**
- Isolated RS-485/RS-422 interfaces for industrial communication
- Industrial field networks where electrical isolation is critical
- Multipoint data transmission systems, allowing up to 256 nodes on a single bus
- Applications requiring robust ESD protection and high common-mode transient immunity, such as factory automation, process control, and remote sensor networks.

This component is particularly useful in environments where electrical noise and potential ground loops can disrupt communication, making it ideal for industrial and automation applications.
