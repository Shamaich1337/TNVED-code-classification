There is a 2 ms startup time once VDD exceeds VDD,(max).  See “Power Up and Power Down Sequencing” on page 8.\n2. VIH(max) = VDD + 0.3 VDC ;  VIH(max) = VDD + 2.0 VAC (pulse width ≤ 10 ns) for I ≤ 20.0 mA.\n3. VIL(min) = -0.5 VDC ; VIL(min) = -2.0 VAC (pulse width ≤ 10 ns) for I ≤ 20.0 mA.\n4.

As soon as VDD exceeds \nVDD(min), there is a startup time of 2 ms before read or write operations can start. This time allows memory \npower supplies to stabilize. \nThe E and W control signals should track VDD on power up to VDD- 0.2 V or VIH (whichever is lower) and \nremain high for the startup time. In most systems, this means that these signals should be pulled up with a \nresistor so that signal remains high if the driving signal is Hi-Z during power up. Any logic that drives E and \nW should hold the signals high with a power-on reset signal for longer than the startup time. \nDuring power loss or brownout where VDD goes below VWI, writes are protected and a startup time must be \nobserved when power returns above VDD(min).\nFigure 3 – Power Up and Power Down Sequencing Timing Diagram\nBROWNOUT or  POWER LOSS\nNORMAL\n OPERATIONVDD\nREAD/WRITE \nINHIBITEDVWI\n2 ms\nREAD/WRITE \nINHIBITED\nVIH STARTUP\nNORMAL\n OPERATION2 ms\nE\nWRECOVER\nVIH Power Up and Power Down Sequencing\nMR2A16A\nMR2A16A Rev. 11.3 3/20189\nCopyright © Everspin Technologies  2018Parameter Symbol Min Typical Max Unit\nInput leakage current Ilkg(I) - - ±1 μA\nOutput leakage current Ilkg(O) - - ±1 μA\nOutput low voltage\n(IOL = +4 mA)\n(IOL = +100 μA)VOL- - 0.4\nVSS + 0.2V\nOutput high voltage\n(IOH = -4 mA)\n(IOH = -100 μA)VOH2.4\nVDD - 0.2- - VTable 4 – DC Characteristics\nTable 5 – Power Supply Characteristics\nParameter Symbol Typical Max Unit\nAC active supply current - read modes1\n(IOUT= 0 mA, VDD= max)IDDR55 80 mA\nAC active supply current - write modes1\n(VDD= max)\nCommercial Grade\nIndustrial Grade\nExtended Grade\nAEC-Q100 GradeIDDW105\n105\n105\n105155\n165\n165\n165mA\nAC standby current \n(VDD= max, E = VIH)\nno other restrictions on other inputsISB118 28 mA\nCMOS standby current\n(E  ≥  VDD - 0.2 V and VIn ≤ VSS + 0.2 V or ≥ VDD - 0.2 V)\n(VDD = max, f = 0 MHz)ISB29 12 mA\nNotes:\n1.
