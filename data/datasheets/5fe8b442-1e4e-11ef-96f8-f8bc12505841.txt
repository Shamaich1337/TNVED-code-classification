Rev. 0ZRP Apr2023 \n PTC’s – Basic Theory of Operation / “Tripped” Resistance Explanation  \nA Bel PTC consists of a block of polymeric material containing conductive carbon granules which is \nsandwiched between two conductive metal plates.  When this polymer block reaches approx imately 125C, \neither due to current passing through it via conductive chains of carbon particles or due to an external heat \nsource; it swells volumetrically.  This expansion breaks apart a majority of the chains of carbon granules that \nrun randomly between  the two conductive plates.  This behavior results in a sharp increase in resistance \nacross the two plates which all but eliminates current flow through the device, allowing just enough residual \ncurrent flow to maintain the block’s internal temperature at 125C.  Once this “tripped” state current is cut off, \nthe polymer brick cools and shrinks to its original size, thereby allowing its broken carbon chains to \nreestablish themselves and permit the part to return to its low resistance state.  Once cooled to ro om \nambient, the PTC will once again exhibit a resistance less than its “R1max” rating.  \nAt currents below the device IHOLD rating, AND at temperatures below 100C, the PTC maintains a \nresistance value below its R1 MAX rating.  \nThe catalog data for each devic e specifies a "Typical Power" value. This is the power required to exactly \nmatch the heat lost by the tripped device to its ambient surroundings at 23C. By Ohm\'s Law, power can be \nstated as: W = E²/R. Thus the approximate resistance of a “Tripped” PTC can be determined by: R = E² /W, \nwhere "E" is the voltage appearing across the PTC (usually the supply\'s open circuit voltage), and "W" is the \nTypical Power value for the particular PTC.  \nSince the PPTC acts to maintain a constant internal temperature, its appar ent resistance will change based \nupon applied voltage and, to a lesser degree, ambient conditions. Consider the following example....  \nA PTC with a Typical Power of 1 watt protecting a circuit using a 60V supply will demonstrate an apparent, \ntripped resist ance "R" of:   \nR = 60² /1 = 3,600 ohms  \nThis same tripped device when used to protect a 12V circuit would now present an apparent resistance of:   \nR = 12² /1 = 144 ohms  \nThe value for Typical Power is "typical" because any physical factors that affect heat l oss (such as ambient \ntemperature or air convection) will somewhat alter the level of power that the PTC needs to maintain its \ninternal temperature. In short, PTCs do not exhibit a constant, quantifiable tripped resistance value.  \n \nAverage Time Curre nt Chara cteristic Curve at 23° C  \n.  \nThe Average Time Current Characteristic Curve and Temperature Rerating Curve are affected by a number of variables and these curves are \nprovided for guidance only.          \nSpecifications subject to change without notice  \nType 0ZRP Series   3 / 4 \n \n \n \nBel Fuse Inc. \n206 Van Vorst Street  \nJersey City, NJ 07302 USA    \n+1 201.432.0463  \nBel.US.CS@belf.com  \nbelfuse.com/circuit -protection  \n© 20 23 Bel Fuse, Inc.

Operation beyond the specified maximum ratings or improper use \nmay result in damage and possible electrical arcing and/or flame.  \n2. These Polymer PTC (PPTC) devices are intended for protection \nagainst occasional overcurrent/ overtemperature fault conditions \nand may not be suitable for use in applications where repeated \nand/or prolonged fault conditions are anticipated.  \n3. Avoid contact of PTC device with chemical solvent.  Prolonged \ncontact may adversely impact the PTC perfor mance.  \n4. These PTC devices may not be suitable for use in circuits with a \nlarge inductance, as the PTC trip can generate circuit voltage \nspikes above the PTC rated voltage.  \n5. These devices may be used in both DC and AC circuits provided \nthat peak -to-peak line voltage when carrying AC does not exceed \nthe PTC’s Vmax rating.   As PTCs are essentially thermal devices, \nthe RMS value of AC current carried by a PTC will produce \ntripping parameters and times -to-trip similar to those of a DC \nvoltage of the same magnitude.  \n6. If potting is mandated, avoid rigid potting compounds as they will \nencase the PTC and prevent it from volumetrically expanding to \nproperly respond to a trip event.
