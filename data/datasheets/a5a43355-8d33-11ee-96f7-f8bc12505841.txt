The LTC2380-16 consumes only 19mW and \nachieves ±0.6LSB INL maximum, no missing codes at  \n16 bits with 96.2dB SNR.\nThe LTC2380-16 has a high speed SPI-compatible serial \ninterface that supports 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V and 5V logic \nwhile also featuring a daisy-chain mode. The fast 2Msps \nthroughput with no cycle latency makes the LTC2380-16 \nideally suited for a wide variety of high speed applications. An internal oscillator sets the conversion time, easing exter -\nnal timing considerations. The LTC2380-16 automatically \npowers down between conversions, leading to reduced power dissipation that scales with the sampling rate.\nThe LTC2380-16 features a unique digital gain compres -\nsion (DGC) function, which eliminates the driver amplifier ’s \nnegative supply while preserving the full resolution of the \nADC. When enabled, the ADC performs a digital scaling function that maps zero-scale code from 0V to 0.1 • V\nREF \nand full-scale code from V REF to 0.9 • VREF. For a typical \nreference voltage of 5V, the full-scale input range is now 0.5V to 4.5V, which provides adequate headroom for powering the driving amplifier from a single 5.5V supply.\n32k Point FFT f S = 2Msps, f IN = 2kHzAPPLICATIONS n2Msps Throughput Rate\n n±0.6LSB INL (Max)\n nGuaranteed 16-Bit No Missing Codes\n nLow Power: 19mW at 2Msps, 19µW at 2ksps\n n96.2dB SNR (Typ) at f IN = 2kHz\n n–117dB THD (Typ) at f IN = 2kHz\n nDigital Gain Compression (DGC)\n nGuaranteed Operation to 125°C\n n2.5V Supply\n nFully Differential Input Range ±V REF\n nVREF Input Range from 2.5V to 5.1V\n nNo Pipeline Delay, No Cycle Latency\n n1.8V to 5V I/O Voltages\n nSPI-Compatible Serial I/O with Daisy-Chain Mode\n nInternal Conversion Clock\n n16-Lead MSOP and 4mm × 3mm DFN Packages\n nMedical Imaging\n nHigh Speed Data Acquisition\n nPortable or Compact Instrumentation\n nIndustrial Process Control\n nLow Power Battery-Operated Instrumentation\n nATE\nFREQUENCY (kHz)0 100 200 300 400 1000900 800 700 600 500–180AMPLITUDE (dBFS)–60–40–20\n–80\n–100\n–120–140–1600\n238016 TA02SNR = 96.4dB\nTHD = –119dBSINAD = 96.3dBSFDR = 122dB\nVREF20/uni03A9VREF\n0V\nVREF\n0V 20/uni03A93300pF3300pF\n3300pFSAMPLE CLOCK\n238016 TA0110µF 0.1µF2.5V\nREF1.8V TO 5V\n2.5V TO 5.1V\n47µF(X5R, 0805 SIZE)REF GNDCHAIN\nRDL/SDI\nSDO\nSCK\nBUSY\nCNV\nREF/DGCL TC2380-16VDD OVDD\nIN+\nIN–L, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks and \nSoftSpan is a trademark of Linear Technology Corporation.

Operating \nfrom a single 2.5V supply, the LTC2380-16 supports a large and flexible ±V\nREF fully differential input range with \nVREF ranging from 2.5V to 5.1V, making it ideal for high \nperformance applications which require a wide dynamic range. The LTC2380-16 achieves ±0.6LSB INL max, no missing codes at 16 bits and 96.2dB SNR.\nFast 2Msps throughput with no cycle latency makes the \nLTC2380-16 ideally suited for a wide variety of high speed \napplications. An internal oscillator sets the conversion time, easing external timing considerations. The LTC2380-16 \ndissipates only 19mW  at 2Msps , while an auto power-down \nfeature is provided to further reduce power dissipation during inactive periods.\nThe LTC2380-16 features a unique digital gain compres -\nsion (DGC) function, which eliminates the driver amplifier ’s \nnegative supply while preserving the full resolution of the \nADC. When enabled, the ADC performs a digital scaling function that maps zero-scale code from 0V to 0.1 • V\nREF \nand full-scale code from V REF to 0.9 • VREF. For a typical \nreference voltage of 5V, the full-scale input range is now 0.5V to 4.5V, which provides adequate headroom for powering the driving amplifier from a single 5.5V supply.\nCONVERTER OPERATION\nThe LTC2380-16 operates in two phases. During the ac -\nquisition phase, the charge redistribution capacitor D/A \nconverter (CDAC) is connected to the IN\n+ and IN– pins \nto sample the differential analog input voltage. A rising edge on the CNV pin initiates a conversion. During the conversion phase, the 16-bit CDAC is sequenced through a \nsuccessive approximation algorithm, effectively comparing the sampled input with binary-weighted fractions of the reference voltage (e.g. V\nREF/2, V REF/4 … VREF/65536) using \nthe differential comparator. At the end of conversion, the CDAC output approximates the sampled analog input. The ADC control logic then prepares the 16-bit digital output \ncode for serial transfer.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 2.

The Equivalent Circuit for the \nDifferential Analog Input of the LTC2380-16ANALOG INPUT\nThe analog inputs of the LTC2380-16 are fully differential \nin order to maximize the signal swing that can be digitized. \nThe analog inputs can be modeled by the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 3. The diodes at the input provide ESD protection. In the acquisition phase, each input sees ap -\nproximately 45pF (C\nIN) from the sampling CDAC in series \nwith 40Ω (R ON) from the on-resistance of the sampling \nswitch. Any unwanted signal that is common to both inputs will be reduced by the common mode rejection of the ADC. The inputs draw a current spike while charging the C\nIN capacitors during acquisition. During conversion, \nthe analog inputs draw only a small leakage current.\nLTC2380-1611\n238016fb\nFor more information www.linear.com/LTC2380-16APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nINPUT DRIVE CIRCUITS\nA low impedance source can directly drive the high im -\npedance inputs of the LTC2380-16 without gain error. A \nhigh impedance source should be buffered to minimize \nsettling time during acquisition and to optimize the dis -\ntortion performance of the ADC. Minimizing settling time is important even for DC inputs, because the ADC inputs draw a current spike when entering acquisition.\nFor best performance, a buffer amplifier should be used \nto drive the analog inputs of the LTC2380-16. The ampli-\nfier provides low output impedance, which produces fast settling of the analog signal during the acquisition phase. It also provides isolation between the signal source and the current spike the ADC inputs draw.\nInput Filtering\nThe noise and distortion of the buffer amplifier and signal \nsource must be considered since they add to the ADC noise and distortion. Noisy input signals should be filtered prior to the buffer amplifier input with an appropriate filter to minimize noise. The simple 1-pole RC lowpass filter (L PF1) \nshown in Figure 4 is sufficient for many applications.\nAnother filter network consisting of L PF2 should be used \nbetween the buffer and ADC input to both minimize the \nnoise contribution of the buffer and to help minimize distur -\nbances reflected into the buffer from sampling transients. Long RC time constants at the analog inputs will slow down the settling of the analog inputs. Therefore, L PF2 \nrequires a wider bandwidth than L PF1. A buffer amplifier \nwith a low noise density must be selected to minimize degradation of the SNR.\n20/uni03A9\n3300pF\n6600pF\n20/uni03A9500/uni03A9LPF2\nLPF1\nBW = 800kHzBW = 48kHzSINGLE-ENDED-\nTO-DIFFERENTIAL\nDRIVERSINGLE-ENDED-\nINPUT SIGNAL\nL TC2380-16IN+\nIN–\n238016 F043300pF\n3300pFHigh quality capacitors and resistors should be used in the RC filters since these components can add distortion. NPO and silver mica type dielectric capacitors have excellent linearity. Carbon surface mount resistors can generate distortion from self heating and from damage that may occur during soldering. Metal film surface mount resistors are much less susceptible to both problems.\nSingle-Ended-to-Differential Conversion\nFor single-ended input signals, a single-ended to differential \nconversion circuit must be used to produce a differential signal at the inputs of the LTC2380-16. The LT6350 ADC driver is recommended for performing single-ended-to-differential conversions. The LT6350 is flexible and may be configured to convert single-ended signals of various amplitudes to the ±5V differential input range of the LTC2380-16. The LT6350 is also available in H-grade to \ncomplement the extended temperature operation of the LTC2380-16 up to 125°C.\nFigure 5a shows the LT6350 being used to convert a 0V \nto 5V single-ended input signal. In this case, the first \namplifier is configured as a unity gain buffer and the single-\nended input signal directly drives the high-impedance input of the amplifier. As shown in the FFT of Figure 5b, \nthe LT6350 drives the LTC2380-16 to near full data sheet -\ndata sheet performance.\nThe LT6350 can also be used to buffer and convert large \ntrue bipolar signals which swing below ground to the ±5V \ndifferential input range of the LTC2380-16 in order to \nmaximize the signal swing that can be digitized. Figure\xa0 6a \nshows the LT6350 being used to convert a ±10V true bi -\npolar signal for use by the LTC2380-16. In this case, the first amplifier in the LT6350 is configured as an inverting \namplifier stage, which acts to attenuate and level shift the input signal to the 0V to 5V input range of the LTC2380-16. \nIn the inverting amplifier configuration, the single-ended input signal source no longer directly drives a high imped -\nance input of the first amplifier . The input impedance is instead set by resistor R\nIN. RIN must be chosen carefully \nbased on the source impedance of the signal source. Higher values of R\nIN tend to degrade both the noise and \ndistortion of the LT6350 and LTC2380-16 as a system.Figure 4.

Figure 9b \nshows an FFT plot with the LTC2380-16 being driven by \nthe LT6350 with digital gain compression enabled.\nADC REFERENCE\nThe LTC2380-16 requires an external reference to define \nits input range. A low noise, low temperature drift refer -\nence is critical to achieving the full data sheet performance \nof the ADC. Linear Technology offers a portfolio of high performance references designed to meet the needs of many applications. With its small size, low power and high accuracy, the LTC6655 -5 is particularly well suited for \nuse with the LTC2380-16. The LTC6655-5 offers 0.025% \n(max) initial accuracy and 2ppm/°C (max) temperature \ncoefficient for high precision applications. The LTC6655-5 \nis fully specified over the H-grade temperature range and complements the extended temperature operation of the LTC2380-16 up to 125°C. We recommend bypassing the LTC6655-5 with a 47µF ceramic capacitor (X5R, 0805 \nsize) close to the REF pin.\nThe REF pin of the LTC2380-16 draws charge (Q\nCONV) from \nthe 47µF bypass capacitor during each conversion cycle. \nThe reference replenishes this charge with a DC current, \nIREF = QCONV/tCYC. The DC current draw of the REF pin, \nIREF, depends on the sampling rate and output code. If \nthe LTC2380-16 is used to continuously sample a signal at a constant rate, the LTC6655-5 will keep the deviation of the reference voltage over the entire code span to less than 0.5LSBs.\nWhen idling, the REF pin on the LTC2380-16 draws only \na small leakage current (< 1µA). In applications where a \nburst of samples is taken after idling for long periods as \nshown in Figure 10, I\nREF quickly goes from approximately \nCNV\nIDLE\nPERIODIDLE\nPERIOD\n238016 F10\nFigure 10.

This step in DC \ncurrent draw triggers a transient response in the reference \nthat must be considered since any deviation in the refer -\nence output voltage will affect the accuracy of the output code. In applications where the transient response of the reference is important, the fast settling LTC6655-5 refer -\nence is also recommended.\nDYNAMIC PERFORMANCE\nFast Fourier T ransform (FFT) techniques are used to test \nthe ADC’s frequency response, distortion and noise at the rated throughput. By applying a low distortion sine wave and analyzing the digital output using an FFT algorithm, the ADC’s spectral content can be examined for frequen -\ncies outside the fundamental. The LTC2380-16 provides \nguaranteed tested limits for both AC distortion and noise measurements.\nSignal-to-Noise and Distortion Ratio (SINAD)\nThe signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) is the \nratio between the RMS amplitude of the fundamental input frequency and the RMS amplitude of all other frequency components at the A/D output. The output is band-limited to frequencies from above DC and below half the sampling frequency. Figure 11 shows that the LTC2380-16 achieves \na typical SINAD of 96dB at a 2MHz sampling rate with a \n2kHz input.Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio between the \nRMS amplitude of the fundamental input frequency and the RMS amplitude of all other frequency components except the first five harmonics and DC. Figure 11 shows that the LTC2380-16 achieves a typical SNR of 96.2dB at \na 2MHz sampling rate with a 2kHz input.\nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)\nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD) is the ratio of the RMS sum \nof all harmonics of the input signal to the fundamental itself. The out-of-band harmonics alias into the frequency band between DC and half the sampling frequency (f\nSMPL/2). \nTHD is expressed as:\n  THD=20logV22+V32+V42+…+ VN2\nV1\nwhere V1 is the RMS amplitude of the fundamental fre -\nquency and V2 through V N are the amplitudes of the second \nthrough Nth harmonics.\nPOWER CONSIDERATIONS\nThe LTC2380-16 provides two power supply pins : the \n2.5V power supply (V DD), and the digital input/output \ninterface power supply (OV DD). The flexible OV DD supply \nallows the LTC2380-16 to communicate with any digital \nlogic operating between 1.8V and 5V, including 2.5V and \n3.3V systems.\nPower Supply Sequencing\nThe LTC2380-16 does not have any specific power supply \nsequencing requirements. Care should be taken to adhere \nto the maximum voltage relationships described in the Absolute Maximum Ratings section. The LTC2380\n-16 \nhas a power-on-reset (POR) circuit that will reset the LTC2380-16 at initial power-up or whenever the power supply voltage drops below 1V. Once the supply voltage re-enters the nominal supply voltage range, the POR will \nLTC2380-1615\n238016fb\nFor more information www.linear.com/LTC2380-16reinitialize the ADC. No conversions should be initiated \nuntil 20µs after a POR event to ensure the reinitialization \nperiod has ended. Any conversions initiated before this time will produce invalid results.\nTIMING AND CONTROL\nCNV Timing\nThe LTC2380-16 conversion is controlled by CNV. A ris -\ning edge on CNV will start a conversion and power up \nthe LTC2380-16. Once a conversion has been initiated, \nit cannot be restarted until the conversion is complete. For optimum performance, CNV should be driven by a clean low jitter signal. Converter status is indicated by the BUSY output which remains high while the conversion is in progress. To ensure that no errors occur in the digitized results, any additional transitions on CNV should occur within 40ns from the start of the conversion or after the \nconversion has been completed. Once the conversion has completed, the LTC2380-16 powers down and begins acquiring the input signal.\nInternal Conversion Clock\nThe LTC2380-16 has an internal clock that is trimmed to \nachieve a maximum conversion time of 322ns\n. With a min -\nimum acquisition time of 165ns, throughput performance  \nof 2Msps is guaranteed without any external adjustments.\nAuto Power-DownThe LTC2380 -16 automatically powers down after a \nconversion has been completed and powers up once a \nnew conversion is initiated on the rising edge of CNV . During power down, data from the last conversion can be clocked out. To minimize power dissipation during power down, disable SDO and turn off SCK. The auto power-down feature will reduce the power dissipation of the LTC2380-16 as the sampling frequency is reduced. \nSince power is consumed only during a conversion, the APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC2380 -16 remains powered-down for a larger fraction of \nthe conversion cycle (t CYC) at lower sample rates, thereby \nreducing the average power dissipation which scales with the sampling rate as shown in Figure 12.\nDIGITAL INTERFACE\nThe LTC2380-16 has a serial digital interface. The flexible \nOV\nDD supply allows the LTC2380-16 to communicate with \nany digital logic operating between 1.8V and 5V, including \n2.5V and 3.3V systems.The serial output data is clocked out on the SDO pin when \nan external clock is applied to the SCK pin if SDO is enabled. Clocking out the data after the conversion will yield the best performance. With a shift clock frequency of at least 100MHz, a 2Msps throughput is still achieved. The serial output data changes state on the rising edge of SCK and can be captured on the falling edge or next rising edge of SCK. D15 remains valid till the first rising edge of SCK.\nThe serial interface on the LTC2380-16 is simple and \nstraightforward to use. The following sections describe the \noperation of the LTC2380-16. Several modes are provided depending on whether a single or multiple ADCs share the SPI bus or are daisy-chained.\nSAMPLING RATE (kHz)0 400 800 2000 1600 12000POWER SUPPL Y CURRENT (mA)5\n4\n2\n138\n7\n6\n238016 F12IVDD\nIREFIOVDD\nFigure 12.

Layout for the \nprinted circuit board (PCB) should ensure the digital and analog signal lines are separated as much as possible.  In particular , care should be taken not to run any digital clocks or signals alongside analog signals or underneath the ADC.  Recommended Layout\nThe following is an example of a recommended PCB layout.  \nA single solid ground plane is used. Bypass capacitors to the supplies are placed as close as possible to the supply pins. Low impedance common returns for these bypass capacitors are essential to the low noise operation of the ADC. The analog input traces are screened by ground. For more details and information refer to DC1783A, the \nevaluation kit for the LTC2380-16.\nPartial Top Silkscreen\nLTC2380-1620\n238016fb\nFor more information www.linear.com/LTC2380-16BOARD LAYOUT\nPartial Layer 1 Component Side\nPartial Layer 2 Ground Plane\nLTC2380-1621\n238016fb\nFor more information www.linear.com/LTC2380-16BOARD LAYOUT\nPartial Layer 3 PWR Plane\nPartial Layer 4 Bottom Layer\nLTC2380-1622\n238016fb\nFor more information www.linear.com/LTC2380-16\nU6\nNC7SZ66P5XC13\n0.1µF\n41 2 9CNV\nSCKC20\n47µF6.3V0805C560.1µF\nCNVREFGND\nGNDGNDGND\nREF/DGCV\nDDVREF\n0.8V REFOVDD\nSCK\nSDO\nBUSY\nRDL/SDISDO\nBUSY\nRDL TC2380-16\nIN–IN+ 13\n14\n11\n12B A5\n3GNDVCC\nOE+3.3VR5\n49.9/uni03A91206R61kU8NC7SZ04P5XU2NC7SVU04P5XU20L TC6655AHMS8-5\nU3\nNL17SZ74U4NC7SVU04P5X\nCNVST_33\nFROM CPLDCLKTO CPLDC5\n0.1µFC1\n0.1µF\nC110.1µFSHDN\nGNDGND\nOUT_F\nGNDGND9V TO 10V 1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5+3.3V +3.3V +3.3V\n34 25\n34 25C2\n0.1µF\nR3\n33/uni03A9R2\n1kR1\n33/uni03A9\n+3.3V+3.3V\n31\n4\n62\n87\n5\nR8\n33/uni03A9C3\n0.1µF\nR4\n33/uni03A9C4\n0.1µF\nVIN\nOUT_S GND VCC\nCLR\\\nQ\\CP\nQD\nPR\\\n34 25+3.3V\nDC590 DETECT\nTO CPLD+3.3V\nC58OPT\nU9NC7SZ04P5XC15\n0.1µF\nC160.1µF34 25+3.3V\nR13\n1kR172k\nR104.99kU724LC025-I/ST R114.99kR124.99k\nC140.1µF\n68\n4\n238016 BL5\n7\n3\n2\n1SCL\nSDA\nARRAY\nEEPROMWP\nA2A1A0\nVSSVCC\n1\n3579\n11132468101214\nJ3\nDC590\nSDOSCK\nCNV9V TO\n10VR71k10\n1663\n115\n72\n8JP6\nFS\n1\n2\n3\nHD1X3-100\nOPTC7\n0.1µFC610µF6.3V\n+2.5V\nC100.1µF\nC393300pFNPO\nC193300pF1206 NPO\nR38OPTR36\n20/uni03A9\nR35OPTR45\nØ/uni03A9\nR340/uni03A9\nC403300pFNPOC910µF6.3V\nR16\n0/uni03A9R32\n20/uni03A9OUT1V+\nV–V+ SHDN\nOUT2 54\n–IN1+IN1 87 3\n+IN2 2\n6R19\n0/uni03A9+–\nR18\n1kR31\nOPT\nU15L T6350CMS8\nR32\n0/uni03A9\nC4215pF\nC4510µF\nC551µF V\n+\nV–\nC57\n0.1µFR37OPTR9OPT\nC6110µF6.3V\nC63\n10µF6.3VC621µF\nC430.1µFR15OPT C18OPTC1710µF\nJP2\nCM\nE7\nEXT_CM1+2.5V\n2\n3VREF/2\nEXT\nHD1X3-100C8\n1µF\nC461µFR401k\nR39\n0/uni03A9\n1\n23COUPLING\nAC DC \nJP1\nHD1X3-100\nC44\n1µF\nC49OPTC4810µF6.3VC47OPTR41OPTC591µF\nC600.1µF1\n23JP5\nHD1X3-100COUPLING\nAC DC DB16DB17\n39\n3735333129272523211917151311\n97531DB0DB1DB2DB3DB4DB5DB6DB7DB8DB9DB10DB11DB12DB13DB14DB15\nCLKOUT\n1403836343230282624222018161412108642J2\nCON-EDGE 40-100\nCLK INJ1\nJ4\nJ8R14\n0/uni03A9\nAIN+\nAIN––+BOARD LAYOUT\nPartial Schematic of Demoboard\nLTC2380-1623\n238016fb\nFor more information www.linear.com/LTC2380-16PACKAGE DESCRIPTION\n3.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)4.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
