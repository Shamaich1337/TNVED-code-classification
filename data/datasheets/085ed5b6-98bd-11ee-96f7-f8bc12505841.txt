Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nOverview\n1O v e r v i e w\n1.1 General description\nThe Infineon S25FL512S device is a flash non-volatile memory product using: \n• MIRRORBIT™ technology - that stores two data bits in each memory array transistor\n• Eclipse architecture - that dramatically improves program and erase performance\n• 65 nm process lithography\nThis device connects to a host system via an SPI. Tradit ional SPI single bit serial input and output (Single I/O or \nSIO) is supported as well as optional two bit (Dual I/O or  DIO) and four bit (Quad I/O or QIO) serial commands. \nThis multiple width interface is called  SPI Multi-I/O or MIO. In addition, the FL-S family adds support for Double \nData Rate (DDR) read commands for SIO, DIO, and QIO that transfer address and read data on both edges of the clock.\nThe Eclipse architecture features a Page Programming Bu ffer that allows up to 256 words (512 bytes) to be \nprogrammed in one operation, resulting in faster effe ctive programming and erase than prior generation SPI \nprogram or erase algorithms. \nExecuting code directly from flash memory is often called Execute-In-Place or XIP . By using FL-S devices at the \nhigher clock rates supported, with QIO or DDR-QIO commands, the instruction read transfer rate can match or exceed traditional parallel interf ace, asynchronous, NOR flash memories while reducing signal count \ndramatically.\nThe S25FL512S product offers high densities coupled with  the flexibility and fast performance required by a \nvariety of embedded applications. It is idea l for code shadowing, XIP , and data storage.\nDatasheet 7 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nOverview\n1.2 Migration notes\n1.2.1 Features comparison\nThe S25FL512S device is command set and footprint compat ible with prior generation FL-K and FL-P families.\nTable 1 FL generations comparison\nParameter FL-K FL-P FL-S\nTechnology Node 90 nm 90 nm 65 nm Architecture Floating Gate MirrorBit MirrorBit Eclipse Release Date In Production In Production In ProductionDensity 4 Mb–128 Mb 32 Mb–256 Mb 512 MbBus Width ×1, ×2, ×4 ×1, ×2, ×4 ×1, ×2, ×4\nSupply Voltage 2.7 V–3.6 V 2.7 V–3.6 V2.7 V–3.6 V / \n1.65 V–3.6 V V\nIO\nNormal Read Speed (SDR) 6 MBps (50 MHz) 5 MBps (40 MHz) 6 MBps (50 MHz)\nFast Read Speed (SDR) 13 MBps (104 MHz) 13 MBps (104 MHz) 17 MBps (133 MHz)\nDual Read Speed (SDR) 26 MBps (104 MHz) 20 MBps (80 MHz) 26 MBps (104 MHz)\nQuad Read Speed (SDR) 52 MBps (104 MHz) 40 MBps (80 MHz) 52 MBps (104 MHz)\nFast Read Speed (DDR) – – 20 MBps (80 MHz)Dual Read Speed (DDR) – – 40 MBps (80 MHz)Quad Read Speed (DDR) – – 80 MBps (80 MHz)Program Buffer Size 256B 256B 512BErase Sector Size 4 KB / 32 KB / 64 KB 64 KB / 256 KB 256 KBParameter Sector Size 4 KB 4 KB –\nSector Erase Time (typ.)30 ms (4 KB), \n150 ms (64 kB)500 ms (64 kB) 520 ms (256 kB)\nPage Programming Time (typ.) 700 µs (256B) 1500 µs (256B) 340 µs (512B)\nOTP 768B (3 × 256B) 506B 1024BAdvanced Sector Protection No No YesAuto Boot Mode No No YesErase Suspend/Resume Yes No YesProgram Suspend/Resume Yes No YesOperating Temperature –40°C to +85°C –40°C to +85°C / +105°C –40°C to +85°C / +105°C\nNotes\n1. 256B program page option only for 128-Mb and 256-Mb density FL-S devices.2.

The FL-S family does have error reporting status bits for program and erase operations. These can be set when there is an internal fail ure to program or erase or when there is an attempt to \nprogram or erase a protected sector. In either case the program or erase operation did not complete as requested by the command.\n1.2.2.2 Secure silicon region (OTP)\nThe size and format (address map) of the One Time Program area is different from prior generations. The method for protecting each portion of the OTP area is different. For additional details see “Secure silicon region (OTP)” \non page 70.\n1.2.2.3 Configuration register Freeze bit\nThe configuration register Freeze bit CR1[0], locks the stat e of the Block Protection bits  as in prior generations. \nIn the FL-S family it also locks the state of the config uration register TBPARM bit CR1[2], TBPROT bit CR1[5], and \nthe Secure Silicon Region (OTP) area. \n1.2.2.4 Sector erase commands\nThe command for erasing an 8-KB area (t wo 4-KB sectors) is not supported. \nThe command for erasing a 4-KB sector is not supported in the 512-Mb density FL-S device.\nThe erase command for 64-KB sectors is not s upported in the 512-Mb density FL-S device.\n1.2.2.5 Deep power-down\nThe Deep Power Down (DPD) function is not supported in FL-S family devices. \nThe legacy DPD (B9h) command code is instead used to en able legacy SPI memory controllers, that can issue the \nformer DPD command, to access a new bank address regi ster. The bank address register allows SPI memory \ncontrollers that do not support more than 24 bits of address, the ability to provide higher order address bits for commands, as needed to access the larger address space of the 512-Mb density FL-S device. For additional \ninformation see “Extended address” on page 54.\n1.2.2.6 New features\nThe FL-S family introduces several new features to SPI category memories:\n• Extended address for access to higher memory density.\n• AutoBoot for simpler access to boot code following power up.\n• Enhanced High Performance read commands using mode bits to eliminate the overhead of SIO instructions \nwhen repeating the same type of read command.\n• Multiple options for initial read latency (number of dummy cycles) for faster initial a ccess time or higher clock \nrate read commands.\n• DDR read commands for SIO, DIO, and QIO.\n• Automatic ECC for enhanced data integrity.• Advanced Sector Protection for individually controlling the protection of each sector. This is very similar to the \nAdvanced Sector Protection feature found in several other Infineon parallel interface NOR memory families.\nDatasheet 9 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nOverview\n1.3 Hardware interface\n1.3.1 Serial peripheral interface with  multiple input / output (SPI-MIO)\nMany memory devices connect to their host system with se parate parallel control, address, and data signals that \nrequire a large number of signal connections and larger package size. The large number of connections increase \npower consumption due to so many signals switching and the larger package increases cost. \nThe S25FL512S device reduces the number of signals for conn ection to the host system by serially transferring \nall control, address, and data information over 4 to 6 signals. This reduces the cost of the memory package, \nreduces signal switching power, and either reduces the ho st connection count or frees host connectors for use \nin providing other features.\nThe S25FL512S device uses the industry standard  single bit Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and also supports \noptional extension commands for two bi t (Dual) and four bit (Quad) wide se rial transfers. This multiple width \ninterface is called SPI Multi-I/O or SPI-MIO.\nDatasheet 10 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nOverview\n1.4 Glossary\nTable 2 Glossary\nItem Description\nCommandAll information transferred between th e host system and memory during one \nperiod while CS# is LOW.

When changing non-volatile data, an erase and reprogramming of any unchanged non-volatile data is done, as part of the operation, such that the non-volatile data  is modified by the write operation, in \nthe same way that volatile data is mo dified – as a single operation. The \nnon-volatile data appears to the host system to be updated by the single write command, without the need for separate commands for erase and reprogram of adjacent, but unaffected data.Table 2 Glossary\n (continued)\nItem Description\nDatasheet 12 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal descriptions\n2 Signal descriptions\n2.1 Input/Output summary\n2.2 Address and data configuration\nTraditional SPI single bit wide commands (Single or SIO) send information from the host to the memory only on \nthe SI signal. Data may be sent back to the host serially on the Serial Output (SO) signal.\nDual or Quad Output commands send information from the host to the memory only on the SI signal. Data will \nbe returned to the host as a sequence of bit pairs on IO0 and IO1 or four bit (nibble) groups on IO0, IO1, IO2, and \nIO3. \nDual or Quad Input/Output (I/O) comma nds send information from the host to the memory as bit pairs on IO0 \nand IO1 or four bit (nibble) groups on IO 0, IO1, IO2, and IO3. Data is returned  to the host similarly as bit pairs on \nIO0 and IO1 or four bit (nibble) gr oups on IO0, IO1, IO2, and IO3.Table 3 Signal list\nSignal name Type Description\nRESET# InputHardware reset:  Low = device resets and returns to standby state, ready to \nreceive a command.

However, any signal connected to an NC must not have voltage levels higher than V\nIO. \nRFU ReservedReserved for future use.  No device internal signal is currently connected to the \npackage connector but there is potential fu ture use of the connector for a signal. \nIt is recommended to not use RFU connectors for PCB routing channels so that the PCB may take advantage of future  enhanced features in compatible \nfootprint devices.\nDNU ReservedDo not use.  A device internal signal may be connected to the package \nconnector. The connection may be used by Infineon for test or other purposes and is not intended for connection to an y host system signal. Any DNU signal \nrelated function will be inactive when the signal is at V\nIL. The signal has an \ninternal pull-down resistor and may be left unconnected in the host system or may be tied to V\nSS. Do not use these connections for PCB signal routing \nchannels. Do not connect any host sy stem signal to this connection. \nDatasheet 13 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal descriptions\n2.3 RESET#\nThe RESET# input provides a hardware method of resett ing the device to standby state, ready for receiving a \ncommand. When RESET# is driven to logic low (VIL) for at least a period of tRP, the device:\n• terminates any operation in progress,• tristates all outputs,\n• resets the volatile bits in the Configuration Register,\n• resets the volatile bits in the Status Registers,• resets the Bank Address Register to zero,• loads the Program Buffer with all ones,\n• reloads all internal configuration information necessary to bring the device to standby mode,\n• and resets the internal Control Unit to standby state.\nRESET# causes the same initialization process as is performed when power comes up and requires t\nPU time.\nRESET# may be asserted low at any time. To ensure da ta integrity any operation that was interrupted by a \nhardware reset should be reinitiated once the device is ready to accept a command sequence.\nWhen RESET# is first asserted Low, the device draws ICC1 (50 MHz value) during tPU. If RESET# continues to be held \nat VSS the device draws CMOS standby current (ISB).\nRESET# has an internal pull-up resi stor and may be left unconnected in the host system if not used.\nThe RESET# input is not available on all packages options.  When not available the RESET# input of the device is \ntied to the inactive state, inside the package.\n2.4 Serial clock (SCK)\nThis input signal provides the synchr onization reference for the SPI interfac e. Instructions, addresses, or data \ninput are latched on the rising edge of the SCK signal. Da ta output changes after the falling edge of SCK, in SDR \ncommands, and after every edge in DDR commands.\n2.5 Chip select (CS#)\nThe chip select signal indicates when a command for the device is in process and the other signals are relevant \nfor the memory device. When the CS# signal is at the logi c HIGH state, the device is not selected and all input \nsignals are ignored and all output signals are high im pedance. Unless an internal Program, Erase or Write \nRegisters (WRR) embedded operation is in progress, the device will be in the Standby Power mode. Driving the \nCS# input to logic LOW state enables the device, placing it in the Active Power mode. After Power-up, a falling edge on CS# is required prior to the start of any command.\nCS# toggle with no CLK and Data is considered as non-va lid. The Flash should not be selected (CS# LOW with no \nCLK and Data) when it’s not being addressed. This is cons idered as a spec violation and can eventually cause the \ndevice to remain in busy state (SR1 = 0x03) after an embedded operation (program/erase/etc.)\n2.6 Serial input (SI) / I/O0\nThis input signal is used to transfer data serially into the device. It receives instructions, addresses, and data to \nbe programmed. Values are latched on the rising edge of serial SCK clock signal.\nSI becomes I/O0 - an input and output during Dual and Quad commands for receiving instructions, addresses, \nand data to be programmed (values latched on rising edge of serial SCK clock signal) as well as shifting out data (on the falling edge of SCK, in  SDR commands, and on every edge of SCK, in DDR commands).\nDatasheet 14 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal descriptions\n2.7 Serial output (SO) / I/O1\nThis output signal is used to transfer data serially out of  the device. Data is shifted out on the falling edge of the \nserial SCK clock signal.\nSO becomes IO1 - an input and output during Dual and Qu ad commands for receiving addresses, and data to be \nprogrammed (values latched on rising edge of serial SCK clock signal) as well as shifting out data (on the falling \nedge of SCK, in SDR commands, and on every edge of SCK, in DDR commands).\n2.8 Write protect (WP#) / I/O2\nWhen WP# is driven LOW (VIL), during a WRR command and while the Status  Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit of \nthe Status Register is set to a ‘1’ , it is not possible to wr ite to the Status and Configuration Registers. This prevents \nany alteration of the Block Protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) and TB PROT bits of the Status Register. As a consequence, all \nthe data bytes in the memory area that are protected by the Block Protect and TBPROT bits, are also hardware protected against data modification if WP# is LOW during a WRR command.\nThe WP# function is not available when the Quad mode is  enabled (CR[1] = 1). The WP# function is replaced by \nIO2 for input and output during Quad mode for receiving addresses, and data to be programmed (values are latched on rising edge of the SCK signal) as well as shifti ng out data (on the falling edge of SCK, in SDR commands, \nand on every edge of SCK, in DDR commands).\nWP# has an internal pull-up resistor; when unconnected, WP# is at V\nIH and may be left unconnected in the host \nsystem if not used for Quad mode.\n2.9 Hold (HOLD#) / I/O3\nThe Hold (HOLD#) signal is used to  pause any serial communications with the device without deselecting the \ndevice or stopping the serial clock.\nTo enter the Hold condition, the device must be selected  by driving the CS# input to the logic LOW state. It is \nrecommended that the user keep the CS# input LOW state du ring the entire duration of the Hold condition. This \nis to ensure that the state of the interface logic re mains unchanged from the moment of entering the Hold \ncondition. If the CS# input is driven to  the logic HIGH state while the device is  in the Hold condition, the interface \nlogic of the device will be reset. To restart communication with the device, it is necessary to drive HOLD# to the logic high state while driving the CS# si gnal into the logic LOW state. This prevents the device from going back \ninto the Hold condition.\nThe Hold condition starts on the falling  edge of the Hold (HOLD#) signal, pr ovided that this coincides with SCK \nbeing at the logic LOW state. If the falling edge does not coincide with the SCK signal being at the logic LOW state, \nthe Hold condition starts whenever th e SCK signal reaches the logic LOW state. Taking the HOLD# signal to the \nlogic LOW state does not terminate any Write, Progra m or Erase operation that is currently in progress.\nDuring the Hold condition, SO is  in high impedance and both the SI and SCK input are Don’t Care.\nThe Hold condition ends on the rising edge of the Hold (HOLD#) signal, provid ed that this coincides with the SCK \nsignal being at the logic LOW state. If the rising edge do es not coincide with the SCK signal being at the logic LOW \nstate, the Hold condition ends whenever the SCK signal reaches the logic LOW state.\nThe HOLD# function is not available when the Quad mode is enabled (CR1[1] = 1). The Hold function is replaced \nby I/O3 for input and output during Quad mode for rece iving addresses, and data to be programmed (values are \nlatched on rising edge of the SCK signal) as well as shifti ng out data (on the falling edge of SCK, in SDR commands, \nand on every edge of SCK, in DDR commands).\nThe HOLD# signal has an internal pull-up resistor and may be left unconnected in the host system if not used for \nQuad mode.\nDatasheet 15 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal descriptions\nFigure 1 HOLD mode operation\n2.10 Core voltage supply (VCC)\nVCC is the voltage source for all device internal logic. It is  the single voltage used for all device internal functions \nincluding read, program, and erase. The voltage may vary from 2.7 V to 3.6 V.\n2.11 Versatile I/O power supply (VIO)\nThe Versatile I/O (VIO) supply is the voltage source for all device input receivers and output drivers and allows the \nhost system to set the voltage levels that the device tolerates on all inputs and drives on outputs (address, control, and I/O signals). The V\nIO range is 1.65 V to VCC. VIO cannot be greater than VCC.\nFor example, a VIO of 1.65 V–3.6 V allows for I/O at the 1.8 V, 2.5 V or 3 V levels, driving and receiving signals to and \nfrom other 1.8 V, 2.5 V or 3 V devices on the same data bus. VIO may be tied to VCC so that interface signals operate \nat the same voltage as the core of the device. VIO is not available in all package options, when not available the \nVIO supply is tied to VCC internal to the package.\nDuring the rise of power supplies the VIO supply voltage must remain less than or equal to the VCC supply voltage. \nThis supply is not available in all package options. For a backward compatible with the SO16 package, the VIO \nsupply is tied to VCC inside the package; thus, the I/O will function at VCC level.\n2.12 Supply and signal ground (VSS)\nVSS is the common voltage drain and ground reference for the device core, input signal receivers, and output \ndrivers.\n2.13 Not connected (NC)\nNo device internal signal is connected to the package co nnector nor is there any future plan to use the connector \nfor a signal. The connection may safely be used for routing space for a signal on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). However, any signal connected to an NC mu st not have voltage levels higher than V\nIO. \n2.14 Reserved for future use (RFU)\nNo device internal signal is currently connected to the package connector but is there potential future use of the \nconnector. It is recommended to not use RFU connector s for PCB routing channels so that the PCB may take \nadvantage of future enhanced features in compatible footprint devices.\n2.15 Do not use (DNU)\nA device internal signal may be connected to the pack age connector. The connection may be used by Infineon \nfor test or other purposes and is not intended for connection to any host system signal. Any DNU signal related \nfunction will be inactive when the signal is at VIL. The signal has an internal pull- down resistor and may be left \nunconnected in the host system or may be tied to VSS. Do not use these connections for PCB signal routing \nchannels. Do not connect any host system signal to these connections.

In some cases a timing diagram may show only mode 0 \nwith SCK LOW at the fall of CS#. In such a case, mode 3 ti ming simply means clock is HIGH at the fall of CS# so no \nSCK rising edge set up or hold time to the falling edge of CS# is needed for mode 3.\nSCK cycles are measured (counted) from one falling edge of  SCK to the next falling edge of SCK. In mode 0 the \nbeginning of the first SCK cycle in a command is measured fr om the falling edge of CS# to the first falling edge of \nSCK because SCK is already LOW at the beginning of a command.CPOL=0_CPHA=0_SCK\nCPOL=1_CPHA=1_SCK\nCS#\nSI\nSOMSB\nMSB\nDatasheet 18 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal protocols\n3.1.2 Double data rate (DDR)\nMode 0 and Mode 3 are also supported for DDR commands.  In DDR commands, the instruction bits are always \nlatched on the rising edge of clock, the same as in SDR commands. However, the address and input data that \nfollow the instruction are latched on both the rising and fa lling edges of SCK. The first address bit is latched on \nthe first rising edge of SCK following the falling edge at th e end of the last instruction bit. The first bit of output \ndata is driven on the falling edge at the end of the last access latency (dummy) cycle.\nSCK cycles are measured (counted) in the same way as in SDR commands, from one falling edge of SCK to the \nnext falling edge of SCK. In mode 0 the beginning of the first SCK cycle in a command is measured from the falling \nedge of CS# to the first falling edge of SCK becaus e SCK is already LOW at the beginning of a command.\nFigure 6 SPI DDR modes supportedCPOL=0_CPHA=0_SCK\nCPOL=1_CPHA=1_SCK\nCS#\nTransfer_Phase\nSI\nSOInst. 7 Inst. 0 A31 A0\nDLP7D0 D1Dummy / DLP Address Mode Instruction\nA30 M7 M6 M0\nDLP0Read\nData\nDatasheet 19 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal protocols\n3.2 Command protocol\nAll communication between the host system and S25FL512S  memory device is in the form of units called \ncommands.\nAll commands begin with an instruction that selects the type of information transfer or device operation to be \nperformed. Commands may also have an address, instruct ion modifier, latency period, data transfer to the \nmemory, or data transfer from the memory. All instruction,  address, and data information is transferred serially \nbetween the host system and memory device.\nAll instructions are transferred from  host to memory as a single bit serial sequence on the SI signal.\nSingle bit wide commands may provide an address or data sent only on the SI signal. Data may be sent back to \nthe host serially on the SO signal.\nDual or Quad Output commands provide an address sent to the memory only on the SI signal. Data will be \nreturned to the host as a sequence of bit pairs on I/O0 and I/O1 or four bit (nibble) groups on I/O0, I/O1, I/O2, and I/O3. \nDual or Quad Input/Output (I/O) comma nds provide an address sent from the host as bit pairs on I/O0 and I/O1 \nor, four-bit (nibble) groups on I/O0, I/O1, I/O2, and I/O3. Data is returned to the host similarly as bit pairs on I/O0 and I/O1 or, four bit (nibble) groups on I/O0, I/O1, I/O2, and I/O3.\nCommands are structured as follows:\n• Each command begins with CS# going LOW and ends with  CS# returning HIGH. The memory device is selected \nby the host driving the Chip Select (CS#) signal LOW throughout a command. \n• The serial clock (SCK) marks the transfer of each bit or group of bits between the host and memory.\n• Each command begins with an 8-bit (byte) instruction. Th e instruction is always presented only as a single bit \nserial sequence on the Serial Input (SI) signal with one bit transferred to the memory device on each SCK rising \nedge. The instruction selects the type of informatio n transfer or device operation to be performed.\n• The instruction may be stand alone or may be followed by address bits to select a location within one of several \naddress spaces in the device. The instruction determines  the address space used. Th e address may be either a \n24-bit or a 32-bit byte boundary, address. The address transfers occur on SCK rising edge, in SDR commands, \nor on every SCK edge, in DDR commands.\n• The width of all transfers following the instruction are determined by the instructio n sent. Following transfers \nmay continue to be single bit serial on only the SI or Serial Output (SO) signals, they may be done in 2-bit groups per (dual) transfer on the I/O0 and I/O1  signals, or they may be done in 4- bit groups per (quad) transfer on the \nI/O0-I/O3 signals. Within the dual or quad groups the le ast significant bit is on I/O0. More significant bits are \nplaced in significance order on each higher numbered I/O signal. Single bits or parallel bit groups are transferred \nin most to least significant bit order.\n• Some instructions send an instruction modifier called mode bits, following the address, to indicate that the \nnext command will be of the same type with an implied, rather than an explicit, instruction. The next command thus does not provide an instruction byte, only a new address and mode bits. This reduces the time needed to \nsend each command when the same command type is repeated in a sequence of commands. The mode bit \ntransfers occur on SCK rising edge, in SDR comma nds, or on every SCK edge, in DDR commands.\n• The address or mode bits may be followed by write data to be stored in the memory device or by a read latency \nperiod before read data is returned to the host. \n• Write data bit transfers occur on SCK rising edge, in  SDR commands, or on every SCK edge, in DDR commands.\n• SCK continues to toggle during any read access latency period. The latency may be zero to several SCK cycles \n(also referred to as dummy cycles). At the end of the read latency cycles, the first read data bits are driven from the outputs on SCK falling edge at the end of the last read  latency cycle. The first read data bits are considered \ntransferred to the host on the following SCK rising edge. Each following transfer occurs on the next SCK rising \nedge, in SDR commands, or on every SCK edge, in DDR commands.\n• If the command returns read data to the host, the device  continues sending data transfers until the host takes \nthe CS# signal HIGH. The CS# signal can be driven HIGH af ter any transfer in the read  data sequence. This will \nterminate the command.\nDatasheet 20 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal protocols\n• At the end of a command that does not return data, the host drives the CS# input HI GH. The CS# signal must go \nHIGH after the eighth bit, of a stand alone instruction or, of  the last write data byte that is transferred. That is, \nthe CS# signal must be driven HIGH wh en the number of clock cycles after CS # signal was driven LOW is an exact \nmultiple of eight cycles. If the CS# signal does not go HIGH exactly at the eight SCK cycle boundary of the \ninstruction or write data, the command is rejected and not executed. \n• All instruction, address, and mode bits are shifted into th e device with the Most Significant Bits (MSb) first. The \ndata bits are shifted in and out of the device MSb first. All data is transferred in byte units with the lowest address byte sent first. Following bytes of data are sent in lo west to highest byte address order i.e. the byte address \nincrements.\n• All attempts to read the flash memory array during a pr ogram, erase, or a write cycle (embedded operations) \nare ignored.

The \ndevice does not react to external signals, and is prev ented from performing any program or erase operation. \n3.3.2 Low power hardware data protection\nWhen VCC is less than VCC (cut-off) the memory device will ignore commands to ensure that program and erase \noperations can not start when the core supp ly voltage is out of the operating range.\n3.3.3 Power-on (cold) reset\nWhen the core voltage supply remains at or below the VCC (low) voltage for \uf0b3 tPD time, then rises to \uf0b3 VCC (Minimum)  \nthe device will begin its Power-on Reset (POR ) process. POR continues until the end of tPU. During tPU the device \ndoes not react to external input signals no r drive any outputs. Following the end of tPU the device transitions to \nthe Interface Standby state and can accept commands.

When RESET# is driven LOW for tRP time the device \nstarts the hardware reset process. The process continues for tRPH time. Following the end of both tRPH and the \nreset hold time following the rise of RESET# (tRH) the device transitions to the Interface Standby state and can \naccept commands. For additional information on hardware reset, see “POR followed by hardware reset” on \npage 39.\n3.3.5 Interface standby\nWhen CS# is HIGH the SPI interface is in standby state. Inputs other than RESET# are ignored. The interface waits \nfor the beginning of a new command. The next interface state is Instruction Cycle when CS# goes LOW to begin a new command. \nWhile in interface standby state the memory device draws standby current (I\nSB) if no embedded algorithm is in \nprogress. If an embedded algorithm is in progress, the related current is drawn until the end of the algorithm \nwhen the entire device retu rns to standby current draw.\n3.3.6 Instruction cycle\nWhen the host drives the MSb of an instruction and CS# goes LOW, on the next rising edge of SCK the device \ncaptures the MSb of the instruction that begins the ne w command. On each following rising edge of SCK the \ndevice captures the next lower significance bit of the 8 bit instruction. The host keeps RESET# high, CS# LOW, \nHOLD# HIGH, and drives Write Protect (W P#) signal as needed for the instruct ion. However, WP# is only relevant \nduring instruction cycles of a WRR command and is otherwise ignored.\nEach instruction selects the address space that is operat ed on and the transfer form at used during the remainder \nof the command. The transfer format may be Single, Dual output, Quad output, Dual I/O, Quad I/O, DDR Single I/O, DDR Dual I/O, or DDR Quad I/O.  The expected next interface state depends on the instruction received.\nSome commands are stand alone, needing no address or da ta transfer to or from the memory. The host returns \nCS# high after the rising edge of SCK for the eighth bit of the instruction in such commands. The next interface \nstate in this case is Interface Standby.\n3.3.7 Hold\nWhen Quad mode is not enabled (CR[1] = 0) the HOLD# / I/O3 signal is used  as the HOLD# input. The host keeps \nRESET# high, HOLD# LOW, SCK may be at a valid level or continue toggling, and CS# is LOW. When HOLD# is LOW \na command is paused, as though SCK were held LOW. SI / I/O0 and SO / I/O1 ignore the input level when acting as inputs and are high impedance when acting as output s during hold state. Whether these signals are input or \noutput depends on the command an d the point in the command sequen ce when HOLD# is asserted LOW.\nWhen HOLD# returns HIGH the next state is the same stat e the interface was in just before HOLD# was asserted \nLOW. \nWhen Quad mode is enabled the HOLD # / I/O3 signal is used as I/O3. \nDuring DDR commands the HOLD# and WP# inputs are ignored.\n3.3.8 Single input cycle - Host to memory transfer\nSeveral commands transfer information af ter the instruction on the single serial input (SI) signal from host to the \nmemory device. The dual output, and quad output comma nds send address to the memory using only SI but \nreturn read data using the I/O signals. The host keep s RESET# HIGH, CS# LOW, HOLD # HIGH, and drives SI as \nneeded for the command. The memory does not drive the Serial Output (SO) signal.\nThe expected next interface state depends on the instru ction. Some instructions continue sending address or \ndata to the memory using additional Single Input Cycles. Ot hers may transition to Single Latency, or directly to \nSingle, Dual, or Quad Output.\nDatasheet 27 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal protocols\n3.3.9 Single latency (Dummy) cycle\nRead commands may have zero to several latency cycles during which read data is read from the main flash \nmemory array before transfer to the host. The number of  latency cycles are determined by the Latency Code in \nthe configuration register (CR[7:6]). During the latency cycles, the host keeps RESET# HIGH, CS# LOW, and HOLD# \nHIGH. The Write Protect (WP#) signal is ignored. The host may drive the SI sign al during these cycles or the host \nmay leave SI floating. The memory does not use any data driven on SI / I/O0 or other I/O signals during the latency \ncycles. In dual or quad read commands, the host must st op driving the I/O signals on the falling edge at the end \nof the last latency cycle. It is recommended that the host  stop driving I/O signals during latency cycles so that \nthere is sufficient time for the host dr ivers to turn off before the memory begi ns to drive at the end of the latency \ncycles. This prevents driver conflict between host and memory when the signal direction changes. The memory \ndoes not drive the Serial Output (SO) or I/O signals during the latency cycles.\nThe next interface state depends on the command structur e, that is the number of latency cycles, and whether \nthe read is single, dual, or quad width.\n3.3.10 Single output cycle - Memory to host transfer\nSeveral commands transfer information back to the host on  the single Serial Output (SO) signal. The host keeps \nRESET# HIGH, CS# LOW, and HOLD# HIGH. The Write Prot ect (WP#) signal is ignored. The memory ignores the \nSerial Input (SI) signal. The memory drives SO with data.\nThe next interface state continues to be Single Output  Cycle until the host returns CS# to HIGH ending the \ncommand.\n3.3.11 Dual input cycle - Host to memory transfer\nThe Read Dual I/O command transfers two address or mode  bits to the memory in each cycle. The host keeps \nRESET# HIGH, CS# LOW, HOLD# HIGH. The Write Protect (W P#) signal is ignored. Th e host drives address on \nSI / I/O0 and SO / I/O1. \nThe next interface state following the delivery of address an d mode bits is a Dual Latency Cycle if there are latency \ncycles needed or Dual Output Cy cle if no latency is required.\n3.3.12 Dual latency (Dummy) cycle\nRead commands may have zero to several latency cycles during which read data is read from the main flash \nmemory array before transfer to the host. The number of  latency cycles are determined by the Latency Code in \nthe configuration register (CR[7:6]). During the latency cycles, the host keeps RESET# HIGH, CS# LOW, and HOLD# \nHIGH. The Write Protect (WP#) signal is ignored. The host  may drive the SI / I/O0 and SO / I/O1 signals during these \ncycles or the host may leave SI / I/O0 and SO / I/O1 floating . The memory does not use any data driven on SI / I/O0 \nand SO / I/O1 during the latency cycles. The host must stop  driving SI / I/O0 and SO / I/O1 on the falling edge at \nthe end of the last latency cycle. It is recommended that the host stop driving them during all latency cycles so \nthat there is sufficient time for the host drivers to turn  off before the memory begins to drive at the end of the \nlatency cycles. This prevents driver conflict between ho st and memory when the signal direction changes. The \nmemory does not drive the SI / I/O0 and SO / I/O1 signals during the latency cycles.\nThe next interface state following the last latency cycle is a Dual Output Cycle.\n3.3.13 Dual output cycle - Memory to host transfer\nThe Read Dual Output and Read Dual I/O return data to the host two bits in each cycle. The host keeps RESET# \nHIGH, CS# LOW, and HOLD# HIGH. The Write Protect (WP#) signal is ignored. The me mory drives data on the \nSI / I/O0 and SO / I/O1 signals during the dual output cycles.\nThe next interface state continues to be Dual Output Cycle until the host returns CS# to HIGH ending the \ncommand.\nDatasheet 28 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal protocols\n3.3.14 QPP or QOR address input cycle\nThe Quad Page Program and Quad Output Read commands send address to the memory only on I/O0. The other \nI/O signals are ignored because the device must be in Quad mode for these commands thus the Hold and Write \nProtect features are not active. The host keeps RESET# HIGH, CS# LOW, and drives I/O0.\nFor QPP the next interface state following the delivery of address is the Quad Input Cycle.\nFor QOR the next interface state following address is a Quad Latency Cycle if there are latency cycles needed or \nQuad Output Cycle if no latency is required.\n3.3.15 Quad input cycle - Host to memory transfer\nThe Quad I/O Read command transfers four address or mode  bits to the memory in each cycle. The Quad Page \nProgram command transfers four data bits to the memory in each cycle. The host keeps RESET# HIGH, CS# LOW, and drives the I/O signals.\nFor Quad I/O Read the next interface state following the delivery of address and mode bits is a Quad Latency Cycle \nif there are latency cycles needed or Quad Output Cycle if  no latency is required. For Quad Page Program the host \nreturns CS# HIGH following the delivery of data to be programmed and the interface returns to standby state.\n3.3.16 Quad latency (Dummy) cycle\nRead commands may have zero to several latency cycles during which read data is read from the main flash \nmemory array before transfer to the host. The number of  latency cycles are determined by the Latency Code in \nthe configuration register (CR[7:6]). During the latency cycles, the host k eeps RESET# HIGH, CS# LOW. The host \nmay drive the I/O signals during these cycles or the host may leave the I/O floating. The memory does not use any \ndata driven on I/O during the latency cycles. The host must  stop driving the I/O signals on the falling edge at the \nend of the last latency cycle. It is re commended that the host stop driving th em during all latency cycles so that \nthere is sufficient time for the host dr ivers to turn off before the memory begi ns to drive at the end of the latency \ncycles. This prevents driver conflict between host and memory when the signal direction changes. The memory \ndoes not drive the I/O signals during the latency cycles.\nThe next interface state following the last latency cycle is a Quad Output Cycle.\n3.3.17 Quad output cycle - Memory to host transfer\nThe Quad Output Read and Quad I/O Read return data to the host four bits in each cycle. The host keeps RESET# \nHIGH, and CS# LOW. The memory drives data on I/O0–I/O3 signals during the Quad output cycles.\nThe next interface state continues to be Quad Output Cycle until the host returns CS# to HIGH ending the \ncommand.\n3.3.18 DDR single input cycle - Host to memory transfer\nThe DDR Fast Read command sends address, and mode bits  to the memory only on the I/O0 signal. One bit is \ntransferred on the rising edge of SCK and one bit on the falling edge in each cycle. The host keeps RESET# HIGH, and CS# LOW. The other I/O signals are ignored by the memory.\nThe next interface state following the delivery of address and mode bits is a DDR Latency Cycle.\n3.3.19 DDR dual input cycle - Host to memory transfer\nThe DDR Dual I/O Read command sends ad dress, and mode bits to the memory only on the I/O0 and I/O1 signals. \nTwo bits are transferred on the rising edge of SCK and two bits on the falling edge in each cycle. The host keeps \nRESET# HIGH, and CS# LOW. The I/O2 and I/O3 signals are ignored by the memory.\nThe next interface state following the delivery of address and mode bits is a DDR Latency Cycle.\nDatasheet 29 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal protocols\n3.3.20 DDR quad input cycle - Host to memory transfer\nThe DDR Quad I/O Read command sends ad dress, and mode bits to the memory on all the I/O signals. Four bits \nare transferred on the rising edge of SCK and four bits on  the falling edge in each cycle. The host keeps RESET# \nHIGH, and CS# LOW.\nThe next interface state following the delivery of address and mode bits is a DDR Latency Cycle.\n3.3.21 DDR latency cycle\nDDR Read commands may have one to several latency cycles during which read data is read from the main flash \nmemory array before transfer to the host. The number of  latency cycles are determined by the Latency Code in \nthe configuration register (CR[7:6]). During the latency cycles, the host keeps RESET# HIGH and CS# LOW. The \nhost may not drive the I/O signals during these cycles. So that there is sufficie nt time for the host drivers to turn \noff before the memory begins to drive. This prevents dr iver conflict between host and memory when the signal \ndirection changes. The memory has an op tion to drive all the I/O signals with a Data Learning Pattern (DLP) during \nthe last 4 latency cycles. The DLP option should not be en abled when there are fewer than five latency cycles so \nthat there is at least one cycle of high impedance for tu rn around of the I/O signals before the memory begins \ndriving the DLP . When there are more than 4 cycles of la tency the memory does not drive the I/O signals until the \nlast four cycles of latency.\nThe next interface state following the last latency cycle is a DDR Single, Dual, or Quad Output Cycle, depending \non the instruction.\n3.3.22 DDR single output cycle - Memory to host transfer\nThe DDR Fast Read command returns bits to the host only on the SO / I/O1 signal. On e bit is transferred on the \nrising edge of SCK and one bit on the falling edge in ea ch cycle. The host keeps RE SET# HIGH, and CS# LOW. The \nother I/O signals are not driven by the memory.\nThe next interface state continues to be DDR Single Output Cycle until the host returns CS# to HIGH ending the \ncommand.\n3.3.23 DDR dual output cycle - Memory to host transfer\nThe DDR Dual I/O Read command returns bits to the host  only on the I/O0 and I/O1 signals. Two bits are \ntransferred on the rising edge of SCK and two bits on the falling edge in each cycle. The host keeps RESET# HIGH, \nand CS# LOW. The I/O2 and I/O3 signals are not driven by the memory.\nThe next interface state continues to be DDR Dual Output Cycle until the host returns CS# to HIGH ending the \ncommand.\n3.3.24 DDR quad output cycle - Memory to host transfer\nThe DDR Quad I/O Read command returns bits to the host on  all the I/O signals. Four bits are transferred on the \nrising edge of SCK and four bits on  the falling edge in each cycle. Th e host keeps RESET# HIGH, and CS# LOW.\nThe next interface state continues to be DDR Quad Output  Cycle until the host returns CS# to HIGH ending the \ncommand.\n3.4 Configuration register effects on the interface\nThe configuration register bits 7 and 6 (CR1[7:6]) select the latency code for all read commands. The latency code \nselects the number of mode bit and latency cycles for each type of instruction.\nThe configuration register bit 1 (CR1[1]) selects whethe r Quad mode is enabled to ignore HOLD# and WP# and \nallow Quad Page Program, Quad Output Read, and Quad I/O Read commands. Quad mode must also be selected to allow Read DDR Quad I/O commands.\nDatasheet 30 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nSignal protocols\n3.5 Data protection\nSome basic protection against unintended changes to st ored data are provided and controlled purely by the \nhardware design. These are described below. Other software managed protection methods are discussed in the software section ( “Software interface” on page 53) of this document.\n3.5.1 Power-up\nWhen the core supply voltage is at or below the VCC (low) voltage, the device is considered to be powered off. The \ndevice does not react to external signals, and is prev ented from performing any program or erase operation. \nProgram and erase operations continue to be prevented during the POR because no command is accepted until \nthe exit from POR to the Interface Standby state.\n3.5.2 Low power\nWhen VCC is less than VCC (cut-off) the memory device will ignore commands to ensure that program and erase \noperations can not start when the core supp ly voltage is out of the operating range.\n3.5.3 Clock pulse count\nThe device verifies that all program, erase, and Write Registers (WRR) commands consist of a clock pulse count \nthat is a multiple of eight before executing them.

See Figure 21 . However, correct operation of th e device is not guaranteed if VCC returns \nbelow VCC (min) during tPU. No command should be sent to the device until the end of tPU.\nAfter power-up (tPU), the device is in Standby mode (not Deep Power Down mode), draws CMOS standby current \n(ISB), and the WEL bit is reset.\nDuring power-down or voltage drops below VCC (cut-off), the voltage must drop below VCC (low) for a period of \ntPD for the part to initialize correctly on power-up. See Figure 22 . If during a voltage drop the VCC stays above VCC \n(cut-off) the part will stay initia lized and will work correctly when VCC is again above VCC (min). In the event POR \ndid not complete correctly after power up, the assertio n of the RESET# signal will restart the POR process.\nNormal precautions must be taken for supply rail decoupling to stabilize the VCC supply at the device. Each device \nin a system should have the VCC rail decoupled by a suitable capacitor close to the package supply connection \n(this capacitor is generally of the order of 0.1 µF).\nFigure 21 Power-upTable 8 Power-up / Power-down voltage and timing\nSymbol Parameter Min Max Unit\nVCC (min) VCC (minimum operation voltage) 2.7  – V\nVCC (cut-off) VCC (Cut 0ff where re-initialization is needed) 2.4 – V\nVCC (low) VCC (low voltage for initialization to occur) \nVCC (Low voltage for initialization to occur at embedded) 1.6 \n2.3  –V\ntPU VCC (min) to Read operation  – 300 µs\ntPD VCC (low) time 10.0 – µs\n(max)\n(min)VCC\ntPU Full Device Access\nTimeVCCVCC\nDatasheet 34 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nElectrical specifications\nFigure 22 Power-down and voltage droptPD(max)\n(min)VCC\ntPU Device Access\n     Allowed\nTimeVCCVCC\nNo Device Access Allowed\n(cut-off)VCC\n(low)VCC\nDatasheet 35 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nElectrical specifications\n4.5 DC characteristics\nApplicable within operating ranges.\nTable 9 DC characteristics\nSymbol Parameter Test conditions Min Typ[11] Max Unit\nVIL Input Low Voltage  -0.5  – 0.2 x VIO V\nVIH Input High Voltage  0.7 x VIO – VIO+0.4 V\nVOL Output Low \nVoltage IOL = 1.6 mA, VCC = VCC min  – 0.15 x VIO V\nVOH Output High \nVoltage IOH = –0.1 mA 0.85 x VIO –  V\nILI Input Leakage \nCurrent VCC = VCC Max, VIN = VIH or VIL – – ±2 µA \nILO Output Leakage \nCurrent VCC = VCC Max, VIN = VIH or VIL – – ±2 µA \nICC1 \nActive Power \nSupply Current (READ) Serial SDR @ 50 MHz\nSerial SDR @ 133 MHz Quad SDR @ 80 MHz Quad SDR @104 MHz Quad DDR @ 66 MHz Quad DDR @ 80 MHz Outputs unconnected during read data return\n[12] – – 1 6\n33/35[13]\n50 61 75 90mA \nI\nCC2 Active Power \nSupply Current (Page Program) CS# = V\nIO– – 100 mA\nICC3 Active Power \nSupply Current (WRR) CS# = V\nIO– – 100 mA\nICC4 Active Power \nSupply Current (SE) CS# = V\nIO– – 100 mA\nICC5 Active Power \nSupply Current (BE) CS# = V\nIO– – 100 mA\nISB (Industrial) Standby Current RESET#, CS# = VIO; SI, SCK = VIO or \nVSS, Industrial Temp– 70 100 µA\nISB \n(Industrial \nPlus)Standby Current RESET#, CS# = VIO; SI, SCK = VIO or \nVSS, Industrial Plus Temp– 70 300 µA\nNotes\n11.Typical values are at TAI = 25°C and VCC = VIO = 3 V.\n12.Output switching current is not included.13.Industrial temperature range / Industrial Plus temperature range.\nDatasheet 36 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nElectrical specifications\n4.5.1 Active power and standby power modes\nThe device is enabled and in the Active Power mode when Chip Select (CS#) is LOW.

The hardware reset process requires a period of t\nRPH to complete. If the POR process did not complete correctly for any reason during \npower-up (tPU), RESET# going LOW will initiate the full POR process instead of the hardware reset process and \nwill require tPU to complete the POR process.\nThe RESET# input provides a hardware method of re setting the flash memory device to standby state.\n•R E S E T #  m u s t  b e  H I G H  f o r  tRS following tPU or tRPH, before going LOW again to initiate a hardware reset.\n• When RESET# is driven LOW for at least a minimum period of time (tRP), the device terminates any operation in \nprogress, tri-states all outputs, and ignores all read/write commands for the duration of tRPH. The device resets \nthe interface to standby state.\n• If CS# is LOW at the time RESET# is asserted, CS# must return HIGH during tRPH before it can be asserted LOW \nagain after tRH.\n• Hardware Reset is only offered in 16-lead SOIC and BGA packages.\nFigure 29 Hardware reset\nTable 12 Hardware reset parameters\nParameter Description Limit Time Unit\ntRS Reset Setup - Prior Reset end and RESET# high before RESET# \nLOWMin 50 ns\ntRPH Reset Pulse Hold - RESET# low to CS# LOW Min 35 µs\ntRP RESET# Pulse Width Min 200 ns\ntRH Reset Hold - RESET# HIGH before CS# LOW Min 50 nsRESET#\nCS#Any prior reset\ntRStRP\ntRH tRH\ntRPH tRPH\nNotes\n19.RESET# LOW is optional and ignored during Power-up (tPU).

A 24-bit byte resolution address can access \nonly 16 MB (128 Mb) of maximum density. A 32-bit byte reso lution address allows direct addressing of up to a \n4 Gbytes (32 Gbits) of address space.\nLegacy commands continue to support 24-bit addresses fo r backward software compatibility. Extended 32-bit \naddresses are enabled in three ways:\n• Bank address register — a software (command) loadable in ternal register that supplies the high order bits of \naddress when legacy 24-bit addresses are in use.\n• Extended address mode — a bank address register bit th at changes all legacy commands to expect 32 bits of \naddress supplied from the host system.\n• New commands — that perform both legacy an d new functions, which expect 32-bit address.\nThe default condition at power-up and after reset, is the Bank address register loaded with zeros and the \nextended address mode set for 24-bit addresses. This en ables legacy software compatible access to the first \n128 Mb of a device. \n7.1.2 Multiple address spaces\nMany commands operate on the main flash memory arra y. Some commands operate on address spaces separate \nfrom the main flash array. Each separate address space uses the full 32-bit address but may only define a small \nportion of the available address space.\n7.2 Flash memory array\nThe main flash array is divided into erase units called  sectors. The sectors are organized as uniform 256-KB \nsectors.\nNote  This is a condensed table that uses a sector as a refe rence. There are address ranges that are not explicitly \nlisted. All 256-kB sectors have  the pattern XXXX0000h–XXXXFFFFh.\n7.3 ID-CFI address space\nThe RDIDJ command (9Fh) reads information from a separate flash memory address space for device \nidentification (ID) and Common Flas h Interface (CFI) information. See “Device ID and common flash interface \n(ID-CFI) address map” on page 133 for the tables defining the contents  of the ID-CFI addre ss space. The ID-CFI \naddress space is programmed by Infineon and read-only for the host system.Table 17 S25FL512S sector and memory address map, uniform 256-KB sectors\nSector size (KB) Sector count Sector rangeAddress range \n(8-bit)Notes\n256 256SA00 00000000h–\n0003FFFFhSector Starting \nAddress\n—\nSector Ending \nAddress: : \nSA255 03FC0000h–\n03FFFFFFh\nDatasheet 55 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nAddress space maps\n7.4 JEDEC JESD216 serial flash disc overable parameters (SFDP) space\nThe RSFDP command (5Ah) reads information from a separate Flash memory address space for device \nidentification, feature, and configuration information, in accord with the JEDEC JESD216B standard for Serial \nFlash Discoverable Parameters. The ID-CFI address spac e is incorporated as one of the SFDP parameters.\nSee “Serial flash discoverable parameters (SFDP) address map” on page 129 for the table defining the \ncontents of the SFDP address space. The SFDP address space is programmed by Infineon and is read-only for the \nhost system\n7.5 OTP address space\nEach S25FL512S memory device has a 1024-byte One Time Program (OTP) address space that is separate from \nthe main flash array. The OTP area is divided into 32, individually lockable, 32-byte aligned and length regions.\nIn the 32-byte region starting at address zero:\n• The 16 lowest address bytes are programmed by Infineon  with a 128-bit random number. Only Infineon is able \nto program these bytes.\n• The next 4 higher address bytes (OTP Lock Bytes) are used to provide one bit per OTP region to permanently \nprotect each region from programming. The bytes are erased when shipped from Infineon. After an OTP region is programmed, it can be locked to prevent further programming, by programming the related protection bit in the OTP Lock Bytes.\n• The next higher 12 bytes of the lowest address region ar e Reserved for Future Use (RFU). The bits in these RFU \nbytes may be programmed by the host system but it must  be understood that a future device may use those \nbits for protection of a larger OTP space. The bytes are erased when shipped from Infineon.\nThe remaining regions are erased when shipped from Infi neon, and are available for programming of additional \npermanent data.\nRefer to Figure 45  for a pictorial representati on of the OTP memory space.\nThe OTP memory space is intended for increased system  security. OTP values, such as the random number \nprogrammed by Infineon, can be used to “mate” a flash component with the system CPU/ASIC to prevent device \nsubstitution.\nThe configuration register FREEZE (CR1[0]) bit protects  the entire OTP memory space from programming when \nset to 1. This allows trusted boot code to control prog ramming of OTP regions then set the FREEZE bit to prevent \nfurther OTP memory space programming during the remainder of normal power-on system operation.\nFigure 45 OTP address space32 Byte OTP Region 3 1\n32 Byte OTP Region 3 0\n32 Byte OTP Region 2 9\n.\n.\n.\n32 Byte OTP Region 3\n32 Byte OTP Region 2\n32 Byte OTP Region 1\n32 Byte OTP Region 0\n16 Byte Random Numbe r Reserve d Lock Byte sLock Bits 31 to 0...When programmed to\n“0” each lock bit \nprotects its related 32\nbyte region from any\nfurther programming\nContents of Region 0 {\nByte 0 Byte 10 Byte 1 F\nDatasheet 56 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nAddress space maps\nTable 18 OTP address map\nRegion Byte address range (Hex) ContentsInitial delivery state \n(Hex)\nRegion 0 000 Least Significant Byte \n(LSB) of Spansion \nProgrammed Random \nNumberSpansion Programmed \nRandom Number\n... ...\n00F Most Significant Byte \n(MSB) of Spansion \nProgrammed Random \nNumber\n010 to 013 Region Locking Bits\nByte 10 [bit 0] locks region \n0 from programming \nwhen = 0\n...\nByte 13 [bit 7] locks region \n31 from programming \nwhen = 0All bytes = FF\n014 to 01F Reserved for Future Use \n(RFU)All bytes = FF\nRegion 1 020 to 03F Available for User \nProgrammingAll bytes = FF\nRegion 2 040 to 05F Available for User \nProgrammingAll bytes = FF\n... ...

The register s are accessed by specific commands. The commands (and \nhexadecimal instruction codes) used for each register ar e noted in each register description. The individual \nregister bits may be volatile, non-volatile, or One Time Programmable (OTP). The type for each bit is noted in each register description. The default state shown for each bit re fers to the state after power-on reset, hardware reset, \nor software reset if the bit is volatile. If the bit is non-vo latile or OTP , the default state is the value of the bit when \nthe device is shipped from Infineon. Non-volatile bits have the same cycling (erase and program) endurance as \nthe main flash array.\nTable 19 Register descriptions\nRegister Abbreviation Type Bit location\nStatus Register 1 SR1[7:0] Volatile 7:0Configuration Register 1 CR1[7:0] Volatile 7:0Status Register 2 SR2[7:0] RFU 7:0AutoBoot Register ABRD[31:0] Non-volatile 31:0Bank Address Register BRAC[7:0] Volatile 7:0ECC Status Register ECCSR[7:0] Volatile 7:0ASP Register ASPR[15:1] OTP 15:1ASP Register ASPR[0] RFU 0Password Register PASS[63:0] Non-volatile OTP 63:0PPB Lock Register PPBL[7:1] Volatile 7:1\nPPB Lock RegisterPPBL[0] Volatile \nRead Only0\nPPB Access Register PPBAR[7:0] Non-volatile 7:0\nDYB Access Register DYBAR[7:0] Volatile 7:0SPI DDR Data Learning Registers NVDLR[7:0] Non-volatile 7:0SPI DDR Data Learning Registers VDLR[7:0] Volatile 7:0\nDatasheet 58 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nAddress space maps\n7.6.1 Status register 1 (SR1)\nRelated Commands: Read Status Register (RDSR1 05h),  Write Registers (WRR 01h), Write Enable (WREN 06h), \nWrite Disable (WRDI 04h), Clea r Status Register (CLSR 30h).\nThe Status Register contains both status and control bits:\nStatus Register Write Disable (SRWD) SR1[7] : Places the device in the Hardware Protected mode when this bit \nis set to ‘1’ and the WP# input is driven low. In this mode , the SRWD, BP2, BP1, and BP0 bits of the Status Register \nbecome read-only bits and the Write Registers (WRR) command is no longer accepted for execution. If WP# is high the SRWD bit and BP bits may be changed by the WRR command. If SRWD is ‘0’ , WP# has no effect and the SRWD bit and BP bits may be changed by the WRR command. Th e SRWD bit has the same non-volatile endurance as the \nmain flash array.\nProgram Error (P_ERR) SR1[6] : The Program Error Bit is used as a program operation success or failure \nindication. When the Program Error bit is set to a ‘1’ it  indicates that there was an error in the last program \noperation. This bit will also be set when the user attemp ts to program within a protected main memory sector or \nlocked OTP region. When the Program Error bit is set to a ‘1’ this bit can be reset to 0 with the Clear Status Register \n(CLSR) command. This is a read-only bit and is not affected by the WRR command.\nErase Error (E_ERR) SR1[5] : The Erase Error Bit is used as an Erase op eration success or failure indication. When \nthe Erase Error bit is set to a ‘1’ it indicates that there was an error in the last erase operation. This bit will also be \nset when the user attempts to erase an individual prot ected main memory sector. The Bulk Erase command will \nnot set E_ERR if a protected sector is found during the command execution. When the Erase Error bit is set to a \n‘1’ this bit can be reset to ‘0’ with the Clear Status Regi ster (CLSR) command. This is a read-only bit and is not \naffected by the WRR command.Table 20 Status register-1 (SR1)\nBitsField \nnameFunction TypeDefault \nstateDescription\n7S R W D S t a t u s  \nRegister \nWrite \nDisableNon-volatile 0 1 = Locks state of SRWD, BP , and configuration \nregister bits when WP# is low by ignoring WRR command0 = No protection, even when WP# is low\n6P _ E R R P r o g r a m m i\nng Error \nOccurredVolatile, Read \nonly01 = Error occurred.\n0 = No Error\n5E _ E R R E r a s e  E r r o r  \nOccurredVolatile, Read \nonly01  =  E r r o r  o c c u r r e d  \n0 = No Error \n4B P 2B l o c k  \nProtectionVolatile if \nCR1[3] = 1, \nNon-volatile if \nCR1[3] = 01 if \nCR1[3] = 1, \n0 when \nshipped \nfrom \nInfineonProtects selected range of sectors (Block) \nfrom Program or Erase 3B P 1\n2B P 0\n1 WEL Write Enable \nLatchVolatile 0 1 = Device accepts Write Registers (WRR), \nprogram or erase commands 0 = Device ignores Write Registers (WRR), program or erase commands This bit is not affected by WRR, only WREN and WRDI commands affect this bit\n0 WIP Write in \nProgressVolatile, Read \nonly0 1 = Device Busy, a Write Registers (WRR), \nprogram, erase or other operation is in progress 0 = Ready Device is in standby mode and can accept commands \nDatasheet 59 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nAddress space maps\nBlock Protection (BP2, BP1, BP0) SR1[4:2] : These bits define the main flash array area to be software-protected \nagainst program and erase commands. The BP bits are either  volatile or non-volatile, depending on the state of \nthe BP non-volatile bit (BPNV) in the configuration register. When one or more of the BP bits is set to ‘1’ , the \nrelevant memory area is protected against program and erase. The Bulk Erase (BE) command can be executed \nonly when the BP bits are cleared to 0’s. See “Block protection” on page 71 for a description of how the BP bit \nvalues select the memory array area protected. The BP bits have the same non-volatile endurance as the main \nflash array.\nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) SR1[1] : The WEL bit must be set to ‘1’ to enab le program, write, or erase operations \nas a means to provide protection against inadvertent ch anges to memory or register values. The Write Enable \n(WREN) command execution sets the Write Enable Latch to a ‘1’ to allow any program, erase, or write commands \nto execute afterwards. The Write Disable (WRDI) command ca n be used to set the Write Enable Latch to a ‘0’ to \nprevent all program, erase, and write commands from exec ution. The WEL bit is cleared to ‘0’ at the end of any \nsuccessful program, write, or erase operation. Followi ng a failed operation the WEL bit may remain set and \nshould be cleared with a WRDI command following a CLSR command. After a power down/power up sequence, \nhardware reset, or software reset, the Write Enable Latch is set to a ‘0’ The WRR command does not affect this bit.\nWrite In Progress (WIP) SR1[0] : Indicates whether the device is performing a program, write, erase operation, \nor any other operation, during which a new operation comma nd will be ignored. When the bit is set to a ‘1’ the \ndevice is busy performing an operat ion. While WIP is ‘1’ , only Read St atus (RDSR1 or RDSR2), Erase Suspend \n(ERSP), Program Suspend (PGSP), Clear Status Register  (CLSR), and Software Reset (RESET) commands may be \naccepted. ERSP and PGSP will only be accepted if memory  array erase or program operations are in progress. The \nstatus register E_ERR and P_ERR bits are updated while WIP = 1. When P_ERR or E_ERR bits are set to ‘1’ , the WIP \nbit will remain set to ‘1’ indicating the device remains busy and unable to receive new operation commands. A Clear Status Register (CLSR) command must be received to return the device to standby mode. When the WIP bit is cleared to ‘0’ no operation is in progress. This is a read-only bit.\nDatasheet 60 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nAddress space maps\n7.6.2 Configuration register 1 (CR1)\nRelated Commands: Read Configuration Register (RDC R 35h), Write Registers (WRR 01h). The Configuration \nRegister bits can be changed using the WRR command with si xteen input cycles.\nThe configuration register controls certain interface and data protection functions.\nLatency Code (LC) CR1[7:6]:  The Latency Code selects the number of  mode and dummy cycles between the end \nof address and the start of read data output for all read commands. \nSome read commands send mode bits following the address to indicate that the next command will be of the \nsame type with an implied, rather than an explicit, instruction. The next command  thus does not provide an \ninstruction byte, only a new address and mode bits. This  reduces the time needed to send each command when \nthe same command type is repeated in a sequence of commands. \nDummy cycles provide additional latency that is needed to complete the initial read access of the flash array \nbefore data can be returned to the host system. Some read commands require additional latency cycles as the SCK frequency is increased.\nThe following latency code tables provide different latenc y settings that are configured by Infineon. The High \nPerformance versus the Enhanced High Performance se ttings are selected by the ordering part number. \nWhere mode or latency (dummy) cycles are shown in the tables as a dash, that read command is not supported \nat the frequency shown. Read is supported only up to 50 MHz but the same latency value is assigned in each latency code and the command may be used when the device is operated at \n\uf0a3 50 MHz with any latency code \nsetting. Similarly, only the Fast Read command is support ed up to 133 MHz but the same 10b latency code is used \nfor Fast Read up to 133 MHz and for the other dual and quad read commands up to 104 MHz. It is not necessary \nto change the latency code from a higher to a lower frequency when operating at lower frequencies where a particular command is supported.

When shipped from Infineon, the NVDLR value is 00h. Once programmed, \nthe NVDLR cannot be reprogrammed or erased; a copy of the data pattern in the NVDLR will also be written to the VDLR. The VDLR can be written to at any time, but on rese t or power cycles the data pattern will revert back to \nwhat is in the NVDLR. During the learning phase descri bed in the SPI DDR modes, the DLP will come from the \nVDLR. Each I/O will output the same DLP value for every clock edge. For example, if the DLP is 34h (or binary \n00110100) then during the first clock edge all I/O’s will outp ut 0; subsequently, the 2nd clock edge all I/O’s will \noutput 0, the 3rd will output 1, etc.\nWhen the VDLR value is 00h, no preamble data patte rn is presented during the dummy phase in the DDR \ncommands.\nTable 35 Non-volatile data learning register (NVDLR)\nBitsField \nnameFunction Type Default state Description\n7 to 0 NVDLP Non-volatile \nData \nLearning \nPatternOTP 00h OTP value that may be transferred to the host \nduring DDR read command latency (dummy) cycles to provide a training pattern to help the host more accurately center the data capture point in the received data bits.\nTable 36 Volatile data learning register (NVDLR)\nBitsField \nnameFunction Type Default state Description\n7 to 0 VDLP Volatile Data \nLearning \nPatternVolatile Takes the value of \nNVDLR during POR \nor ResetVolatile copy of the NVDLP used to enable and \ndeliver the Data Learning Pattern (DLP) to the outputs.

OTP values can “mate” a flash component with \nthe system CPU/ASIC to prevent device substitution. See “OTP address space” on page 55, “One time program \narray commands” on page 118, and “OTP read (OTPR 4Bh)” on page 118.\n8.1.1 Reading OTP memory space\nThe OTP Read command uses the same protocol as Fast Read. OTP Read operations outside the valid 1-kB OTP \naddress range will yield indeterminate data.\n8.1.2 Programming OTP memory space\nThe protocol of the OTP programming command is the same as Page Program. The OTP Program command can \nbe issued multiple times to any given OTP addre ss, but this address space can never be erased. \nAutomatic ECC is programmed on the first programming operation to each 16-byte region. Programming within \na 16-byte region more than once disables the ECC. It is recommended to program each 16-byte portion of each \n32-byte region once so that ECC remains en abled to provide the best data integrity.\nThe valid address range for OTP Program is depicted in Figure 45 . OTP Program operations outside the valid OTP \naddress range will be ignored and the WEL in SR1 will re main high (set to ‘1’). OTP Program operations while \nFREEZE = 1 will fail with  P_ERR in SR1 set to ‘1’ .\n8.1.3 Infineon programmed random number\nInfineon standard practice is to program the low order 16 bytes of the OTP memory space (locations 0x0 to 0xF) \nwith a 128-bit random number using the Linear Congruen tial Random Number Method . The seed value for the \nalgorithm is a random number concatenated with the day and time of tester insertion.\n8.1.4 Lock bytes\nThe LSb of each Lock byte protects the lowest address region related to the byte, the MSb protects the highest \naddress region related to the byte. The next higher addres s byte similarly protects the next higher 8 regions. The \nLSb bit of the lowest address Lock Byte protects the high er address 16 bytes of the lowest address region. In other \nwords, the LSb of location 0x10 protects all the Lock Bytes and RFU bytes in the lowest address region from further programming. See “OTP address space” on page 55.\n8.2 Write enable command\nThe Write Enable (WREN) command must  be written prior to any command that modifies non-volatile data. The \nWREN command sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit. Th e WEL bit is cleared to ‘0’ (disables writes) during \npower-up, hardware reset, or after the device completes the following commands:\n•R e s e t\n• Page Program (PP)\n• Sector Erase (SE)•B u l k  E r a s e  ( B E )\n•W r i t e  D i s a b l e  ( W R D I )\n•W r i t e  R e g i s t e r s  ( W R R )• Quad-input Page Programming (QPP)• OTP Byte Programming (OTPP)\nDatasheet 71 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nData protection\n8.3 Block protection\nThe Block Protect bits (Status Register bits BP2, BP1,  BP0) in combination with the Configuration Register \nTBPROT bit can be used to protect an address range of the main flash array from program and erase operations. \nThe size of the range is determined by the value of the BP  bits and the upper or lower starting point of the range \nis selected by the TBPROT bit of the configuration register. \nWhen Block Protection is enabled (i.e., any BP2–0 are set to ‘1’), Advanced Sector Protection (ASP) can still be \nused to protect sectors not protected by the Block Prot ection scheme. In the case that both ASP and Block \nProtection are used on the same sector the logical OR of  ASP and Block Protection related to the sector is used. \nRecommendation: ASP and Block Protection should not be used concurrently. Use one or the other, but not both. \n8.3.1 Freeze bit\nBit 0 of the Configuration Register is the FREEZE bit. The FREEZE bit locks the BP2–0 bits in Status Register 1 and \nthe TBPROT bit in the Configuration Register to their value at  the time the FREEZE bit is set to ‘1’ . Once the FREEZE \nbit has been written to a logic 1 it cannot be cleared to a logic 0 until a power-on-reset is executed. As long as the FREEZE bit is cleared to logic 0 the status register BP bits and the TBPROT bit of the Configuration Register are \nwritable. The FREEZE bit also protects the entire OTP memory space from programming when set to ‘1’ . Any \nattempt to change the BP bits with the WRR command wh ile FREEZE = 1 is ignored and no error status is set.Table 37 Upper array start of protection (TBPROT = 0)\nStatus Register ContentProtected Fraction of Memory \nArrayProtected Memory (KB)\nFL512S\n512 Mb BP2 BP1 BP0\n000 N o n e 0\n0 0 1 Upper 64th 10240 1 0 Upper 32nd 20480 1 1 Upper 16th 40961 0 0 Upper 8th 81921 0 1 Upper 4th 163841 1 0 Upper Half 327681 1 1 All Sectors 65536\nTable 38 Lower array start of protection (TBPROT = 1)\nStatus Register ContentProtected Fraction of Memory \nArrayProtected Memory (KB)\nFL512S\n512 Mb BP2 BP1 BP0\n000 N o n e 0\n0 0 1 Lower 64th 10240 1 0 Lower 32nd 20480 1 1 Lower 16th 40961 0 0 Lower 8th 81921 0 1 Lower 4th 163841 1 0 Lower Half 327681 1 1 All Sectors 65536\nDatasheet 72 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nData protection\n8.3.2 Write protect signal\nThe Write Protect (WP#) input in combination with the Stat us Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit provide hardware \ninput signal controlled protection. When WP# is LOW and SRWD is set to ‘1’ the Status and Configuration register is protected from alteration. This prevents disabling or changing the protection define d by the Block Protect bits.\n8.4 Advanced sector protection\nAdvanced Sector Protection (ASP) is the name used for a set of independ ent hardware and software methods \nused to disable or enable programming or erase operations , individually, in any or all sectors. An overview of \nthese methods is shown in Figure 46 .\nBlock Protection and ASP protection settings for each sect or are logically OR’d to define the protection for each \nsector, i.e. if either mechanism is protecting a sector the sector cannot be programmed or erased. Refer to “Block \nprotection” on page 71 for full details of the BP2–0 bits.\nFigure 46 Advanced sector protection overview\nEvery main flash array sector has a non-volatile (PPB) and a volatile (DYB) protection bit associated with it. When \neither bit is ‘0’ , the sector is prot ected from program and erase operations.\nThe PPB bits are protected from program and erase when the PPB Lock bit is ‘0’ . There are two methods for \nmanaging the state of the PPB Lock bit, Pers istent Protection and Password Protection.\nThe Persistent Protection method sets the PPB Lock bit to ‘1’ during POR, or Hardware Reset so that the PPB bits \nare unprotected by a device reset. There is a command to clear the PPB Lock bit to ‘0’ to protect the PPB. There \nis no command in the Persistent Protection method to set the PPB Lock bit to ‘1’ , therefore the PPB Lock bit will \nremain at ‘0’ until the next power-off or hardware reset. The Persistent Protection method allows boot code the option of changing sector protection by programming or  erasing the PPB, then protecting the PPB from further \nchange for the remainder of normal system operation by clearing the PPB Lock bit to ‘0’. This is sometimes called Boot-code controlled sector protection.ASP Register  \nOne Time Programmable  \nPassword Method  \n(ASPR[2]=0) Persistent Method  \n(ASPR[1]=0) \n64 - bit Password  \n(One Time Protect)  \nPBB Lock Bit  \n“0” = PPBs locked  \nSector 0  Memory Array  \nSector N  - 2 Sector 1  \nSector 2  \nSector N  - 1 \nSector N  \n1.)

A 64-bit \npassword may be permanently programmed and hidden fo r the password method. A command can be used to \nprovide a password for comparison with the hidden password. If the password matches, the PPB Lock bit is set to ‘1’ to unprotect the PPB. A command can be used to clear the PPB Lock bit to ‘0’ . This method requires use of a password to control PPB protection.\nThe selection of the PPB Lock bit management method is made by programming OTP bits in the ASP Register so \nas to permanently select the method used.\n8.4.1 ASP register\nThe ASP register is used to permanen tly configure the behavior of Advanced Sector Protection (ASP) features. \nSee Table 30 .\nAs shipped from the factory, all devices default ASP to the Persistent Protection mode, with all sectors \nunprotected, when power is applied. The device programmer or host system must then choose which sector protection method to use. Programming either of the, one-time programmable, Protection Mode Lock Bits, locks \nthe part permanently in the selected mode:\n• ASPR[2:1] = 11 = No ASP mode selected, Pe rsistent Protection Mode is the default.\n• ASPR[2:1] = 10 = Persistent Protection Mode permanently selected.\n• ASPR[2:1] = 01 = Password Protection Mode permanently selected.• ASPR[2:1] = 00 = Illegal condition, attempting to progra m both bits to zero results in a programming failure.\nASP register programming rules:\n• If the password mode is chosen, the password must be programmed prior to setting the Protection Mode Lock \nBits.\n• Once the Protection Mode is selected, the Protection Mode Lock Bits are permanently protected from \nprogramming and no further changes to the ASP register is allowed.\nThe programming time of the ASP Register is the same as the typical page progra mming time. The system can \ndetermine the status of the ASP register programming op eration by reading the WIP bit in the Status Register. \nSee “Status register 1 (SR1)” on page 58 for information on WIP .\nAfter selecting a sector protection method, each se ctor can operate in each of the following states:\n• Dynamically Locked — A sector is protected and can be changed by a simple command.\n• Persistently Locked — A sector is protected and cannot be changed if its PPB Bit is ‘0’ .\n• Unlocked — The sector is unprotected and can be changed by a simple command.\n8.4.2 Persistent protection bits\nThe Persistent Protection Bits (PPB) are located in a sepa rate non-volatile flash array. One of the PPB bits is \nrelated to each sector. When a PPB is ‘0’ , its related sector is protected from program and erase operations. The PPB are programmed individually but must be erased as  a group, similar to the way individual words may be \nprogrammed in the main array but an entire sector must be erased at the same time. The PPB have the same \nprogram and erase endurance as the main flash memory array. Preprogramming and verification prior to erasure are handled by the device.\nProgramming a PPB bit requires the typical page programmi ng time. Erasing all the PPBs requires typical sector \nerase time. During PPB bit programming and PPB bit erasing,  status is available by reading the Status register. \nReading of a PPB bit requires the initial access time of the device.\nNotes\nEach PPB is individually programmed to ‘0’ and all are erased to ‘1’ in parallel.\nIf the PPB Lock bit is ‘0’ , the PPB Program or PP B Erase command does not execute and fails without \nprogramming or erasing the PPB.\nThe state of the PPB for a given sector can be verified by using the PPB Read command.\nDatasheet 74 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nData protection\n8.4.3 Dynamic protection bits\nDynamic Protection Bits are volatile and unique for ea ch sector and can be indi vidually modified. DYB only \ncontrol the protection for sectors that have their PPB set to ‘1’ . By issuing the DYB Write command, a DYB is \ncleared to ‘0’ or set to ‘1’ , thus placing each sector in the protected or unprotected state respectively. This feature allows software to easily protect sectors against inadve rtent changes, yet does not prevent the easy removal of \nprotection when changes are needed. The DYBs can be set or  cleared as often as needed as they are volatile bits.\n8.4.4 PPB lock bit (PPBL[0])\nThe PPB Lock Bit is a volatile bit for protecting all PPB bits . When cleared to ‘0’ , it locks all PPBs and when set to \n‘1’ , it allows the PPBs to be changed.\nThe PLBWR command is used to clear the PPB Lock bit to ‘0’ . The PPB Lock Bit must be cleared to ‘0’ only after \nall the PPBs are configured to the desired settings.\nIn Persistent Protection mode, the PPB Lock is set to ‘1’ during POR or a hardware reset. When cleared to ‘0’ , no \nsoftware command sequence can set the PPB Lock bit to ‘1 ’ , only another hardware reset or power-up can set \nthe PPB Lock bit.\nIn the Password Protection mode, the PPB Lock bit is cleared to ‘0’ during POR or a hardware reset. The PPB Lock \nbit can only be set to ‘1’ by the Password Unlock command.\n8.4.5 Sector protection states summary\nEach sector can be in one of the following protection states:\n• Unlocked — The sector is unprotected and protection can be changed by a simple command. The protection \nstate defaults to unprotected after a power cycle, software reset, or hardware reset.\n• Dynamically Locked — A sector is protected and protection can be changed by a simple command. The \nprotection state is not saved across a power cycle or reset.\n• Persistently Locked — A sector is protected and protection can only be changed if the PPB Lock Bit is set to ‘1’ . \nThe protection state is non-volatile and saved across a power cycle or reset. Changing the protection state requires programming and or erase of the PPB bits\n8.4.6 Persistent protection mode\nThe Persistent Protection method sets the PPB Lock bit to  ‘1’ during POR or Hardware Reset so that the PPB bits \nare unprotected by a device hardware reset. Software  reset does not affect the PPB Lock bit. The PLBWR \ncommand can clear the PPB Lock bit to ‘0’ to protect the PPB. There is no command to set the PPB Lock bit \ntherefore the PPB Lock bit will remain at ‘0 ’ until the next power-off or hardware reset.Table 39 Sector protection states\nProtection Bit Values Sector StatePPB Lock PPB DYB\n1 1 1 Unprotected – PPB and DYB are changeable1 1 0 Protected – PPB and DYB are changeable1 0 1 Protected – PPB and DYB are changeable1 0 0 Protected – PPB and DYB are changeable0 1 1 Unprotected – PPB not changeable, DYB is changeable0 1 0 Protected – PPB not changeable, DYB is changeable0 0 1 Protected – PPB not changeable, DYB is changeable0 0 0 Protected – PPB not changeable, DYB is changeable\nDatasheet 75 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nData protection\n8.4.7 Password protection mode\nPassword Protection Mode allows an even higher level of security than the Persistent Sector Protection Mode, by \nrequiring a 64-bit password for unlocking the PPB Lock bit.  In addition to this password requirement, after power \nup and hardware reset, the PPB Lock bit is cleared to ‘0’ to ensure protection at power-up. Successful execution of the Password Unlock command by en tering the entire password clears the PPB Lock bit, allowing for sector \nPPB modifications.\nPassword Protection Notes\n• Once the Password is programmed and verified, the Passwor d Mode (ASPR[2] = 0) must be set in order to prevent \nreading the password.\n• The Password Program Command is only capable of programming ‘0’s. Programming a ‘1’ after a cell is \nprogrammed as a ‘0’ results in the cell left as a ‘0’ with no programming error set.\n• The password is all 1’s when shipped from Infineon. It  is located in its own memory space and is accessible \nthrough the use of the Password Program and Password Read commands.\n• All 64-bit password combinations are valid as a password.• The Password Mode, once programmed, prevents reading the 64-bit password and further password \nprogramming. All further program and read commands  to the password region are disabled and these \ncommands are ignored. There is no means to verify what  the password is after the Password Mode Lock Bit is \nselected. Password verification is only allowed before selecting the Password Protection mode.\n• The Protection Mode Lock Bits are not erasable.\n• The exact password must be entered in order for the unlocking function to occur. If the password unlock \ncommand provided password does not match the hidden in ternal password, the unlock operation fails in the \nsame manner as a programming operation on a protected sector. The P_ERR bit is set to one and the WIP Bit \nremains set. In this case it is a failure to change the st ate of the PPB Lock bit because it is still protected by the \nlack of a valid password.\n• The Password Unlock command cannot be accepted any faster than once every 100 µs ± 20 µs. This makes it \ntake an unreasonably long time (58 million years) for a hacker to run through all the 64-bit combinations in an attempt to correctly match a password. The Read Status Register 1 command may be used to read the WIP bit to determine when the device has completed the passw ord unlock command or is ready to accept a new \npassword command. When a valid password is provided  the password unlock command does not insert the \n100 µs delay before returning the WIP bit to ‘0’ .\n• If the password is lost after selecting the Passwor d Mode, there is no way to set the PPB Lock bit.\n• ECC status may only be read from sectors that are read able. In read protection mode the addresses are forced \nto the boot sector address. ECC status is shown in that sector while read protection mode is active.\nDatasheet 76 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n9C o m m a n d s\nAll communication between the host system and the S25F L512S memory device is in the form of units called \ncommands. \nAll commands begin with an instruction that selects the type of information transfer or device operation to be \nperformed. Commands may also have an address, instruct ion modifier, latency period, data transfer to the \nmemory, or data transfer from the memory. All instruction,  address, and data information is transferred serially \nbetween the host system and memory device.\nAll instructions are transferred from  host to memory as a single bit serial sequence on the SI signal.\nSingle bit wide commands may provide an address or data sent only on the SI signal. Data may be sent back to \nthe host serially on SO signal.\nDual or Quad Output commands provide an address sent to the memory only on the SI signal. Data will be \nreturned to the host as a sequence of bit pairs on I/O0 and I/O1 or four bit (nibble) groups on I/O0, I/O1, I/O2, and I/O3. \nDual or Quad Input/Output (I/O) comma nds provide an address sent from the host as bit pairs on I/O0 and I/O1 \nor, four bit (nibble) groups on I/O0, I/O1, I/O2, and I/O3. Data is returned to the host similarly as bit pairs on I/O0 and I/O1 or, four bit (nibble) groups on I/O0, I/O1, I/O2, and I/O3.\nCommands are structured as follows:\n• Each command begins with an eight bit (byte) instruction.\n• The instruction may be stand alone or may be followed by address bits to select a location within one of several \naddress spaces in the device. The address may be either a 24-bit or 32-bit byte boundary address. \n• The Serial Peripheral Interface with Multiple I/O provid es the option for each tran sfer of address and data \ninformation to be done one, two, or four bits in parall el. This enables a trade off between the number of signal \nconnections (I/O bus width) and the speed of information transfer. If the host system can support a two or four \nbit wide I/O bus the memory performance can be increase d by using the instructions that provide parallel two \nbit (dual) or parallel four bit (quad) transfers.\n• The width of all transfers following the instru ction are determined by the instruction sent. \n• All sIngle bits or parallel bit groups are transferred in most to least significant bit order.\n• Some instructions send instruction modifier (mode) bi ts following the address to indicate that the next \ncommand will be of the same type with an implied, rather than an explicit , instruction. The next command thus \ndoes not provide an instruction byte, only a new address and mode bits. This reduces the time needed to send \neach command when the same command type is repeated in a sequence of commands.\n• The address or mode bits may be followed by write data to be stored in the memory device or by a read latency \nperiod before read data is returned to the host. \n• Read latency may be zero to several SCK cycles (also referred to as dummy cycles). • All instruction, address, mode, and data information is transferred in byte granularity. Addresses are shifted \ninto the device with the MSB first. All data is transferre d with the lowest address byte sent first. Following bytes \nof data are sent in lowest to highest byte address order i.e. the byte address increments.\n• All attempts to read the flash memory array during a pr ogram, erase, or a write cycle (embedded operations) \nare ignored. The embedded operation will continue to execute without any affect. A very limited set of \ncommands are accepted during an embedded operatio n. These are discussed in the individual command \ndescriptions. While a program, erase, or write operation is in progress, it is recommended to check that the \nWrite-In Progress (WIP) bit is ‘0’ before issuing most commands to the device, to ensure the new command can \nbe accepted. \n• Depending on the command, the time for execution vari es. A command to read status information from an \nexecuting command is available to determine when the command completes execution and whether the \ncommand was successful.\nDatasheet 77 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n• Although host software in some cases is  used to directly control the SPI interface signals, the hardware interfaces \nof the host system and the memory device generally hand le the details of signal relationships and timing. For \nthis reason, signal relationships and timing are not cove red in detail within this software interface focused \nsection of the document. Instead, the focus is on the logical sequence of bits transferred in each command \nrather than the signal timing and relationships. Followin g are some general signal relationship descriptions to \nkeep in mind. For additional information on the bit leve l format and signal timing relationships of commands, \nsee “Command protocol” on page 19.\n- The host always controls the Chip Select (CS#), Serial Clock (SCK), and Serial Input (SI) - SI for single bit wide \ntransfers. The memory drives Serial Ou tput (SO) for single bit read transf ers. The host and memory alternately \ndrive the I/O0–I/O3 signals durin g Dual and Quad transfers. \n- All commands begin with the host selecting the memory by driving CS# LOW before the first rising edge of \nSCK. CS# is kept LOW throughout a command and when CS# is returned HIGH the command ends. Generally, CS# remains LOW for eight bit transfer multiples to transfer byte granularity information. Some commands \nwill not be accepted if CS# is returned HIGH not at an 8 bit boundary.\n9.1 Command set summary\n9.1.1 Extended addressing\nTo accommodate addressing above 128 Mb, there are three options:\n1.

For backward compatibility to the 3-byte address inst ructions, the standard inst ructions can be used in \nconjunction with the EXTADD Bit in the Bank Address Register (BAR[7]). By default BAR[7] is cleared to 0 (following power up and hardware reset), to enable 3-byte (24-bit) addressing. When set to 1, the legacy commands are changed to require 4 bytes (32 bits) for the address field.

Non-volatile bits in registers are automatically erased and programmed as a single (write) \noperation.\n9.1.3.1 Monitoring operation status\nThe host system can determine when a write, program, er ase, suspend or other embedded operation is complete \nby monitoring the Write in Progress (WIP) bit in the Status Register. The Read from Status Register-1 command \nprovides the state of the WIP bit. The program error (P_E RR) and erase error (E_ERR) bits in the status register \nindicate whether the most recent program or erase command has not completed successfully. When P_ERR or E_ERR bits are set to one, the WIP bit will remain set to one indicating the device remains busy. Under this \ncondition, only the CLSR, WRDI, RD SR1, RDSR2, and software RESET commands are valid commands. A Clear \nStatus Register (CLSR) followed by a Write Disable (WRDI) command must be sent to return the device to standby \nstate. CLSR clears the WIP , P_ERR, and E_ERR bits. WRDI clears the WEL bit.

Double Data \nRate (DDR) commands also define the address an d data bit relationship to both SCK edges:\n• The Read command provides a single address bit per SCK rising edge on the SI signal with read data returning \na single bit per SCK falling edge on the SO signal. This command has zero latency between the address and the returning data but is limited to a maximum SCK rate of 50 MHz.\n• Other read commands have a latency period between th e address and returning data but can operate at higher \nSCK frequencies. The latency depends on the configuration register latency code.\n• The Fast Read command provides a single address bit pe r SCK rising edge on the SI signal with read data \nreturning a single bit per SCK falling edge on  the SO signal and may operate up to 133 MHz.\n• Dual or Quad Output read commands provide address a si ngle bit per SCK rising edge on the SI / I/O0 signal \nwith read data returning two bits, or four bits of  data per SCK falling edge on the I/O0–I/O3 signals.\n• Dual or Quad I/O Read commands provide address two bits or four bits per SCK rising edge with read data \nreturning two bits, or four bits of data per SCK falling edge on the I/O0–I/O3 signals.\n• Fast (Single), Dual, or Quad Double Data Rate read commands provide address one bit, two bits or four bits per \nevery SCK edge with read data returning one bit, two bits , or four bits of data per every SCK edge on the I/O0–\nI/O3 signals. Double Data Rate (DDR) operation is on ly supported for core and I/O voltages of 3 to 3.6V.\n9.1.5 Program flash array\nProgramming data requires two commands: Write Enable  (WREN), and Page Progra m (PP or QPP). The Page \nProgram command accepts from 1 byte up to 512 consecutive bytes of data (page) to be programmed in one operation. Programming means that bits can either be left  at ‘1’ , or programmed from ‘1’ to ‘0’ . Changing bits \nfrom ‘0’ to ‘1’ requires an erase operation.\n9.1.6 Erase flash array\nThe Sector Erase (SE) and Bulk Erase (BE) commands set all th e bits in a sector or the entire memory array to ‘1’ . \nA bit needs to be first erased to ‘1’ before programming can change it to a ‘0’ . While bits can be individually programmed from a ‘1’ to ‘0’ , erasing bits from ‘0’ to ‘1 ’ must be done on a sector-wide (SE) or array-wide (BE) \nlevel.\n9.1.7 OTP , block protection, and advanced sector protection\nThere are commands to read and program a separate One TIme Programmable (OTP) array for permanent data such as a serial number. There are commands to control a contiguous group (block) of flash memory array sectors \nthat are protected from program and erase operations. There are commands to control which individual flash \nmemory array sectors are protected from program and erase operations.\n9.1.8 Reset\nThere is a command to reset to the default conditions present after power on to the device. There is a command to reset (exit from) the Enhanc ed Performance Read Modes. \nDatasheet 83 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n9.1.9 Reserved\nSome instructions are reserved for future use. In th is generation of the S25FL512S some of these command \ninstructions may be unused and not affect device  operation, some may have undefined results. \nSome commands are reserved to ensure  that a legacy or alternate source  device command is allowed without \naffect. This allows legacy software to issue some co mmands that are not relevant for the current generation \nS25FL512S device with the assurance these comma nds do not cause some unexpected action. \nSome commands are reserved for use in special versions of the FL-S not ad dressed by this document or for a \nfuture generation. This allows new host memory controller designs to plan the flexibility to issue these command instructions. The command format is defined if known at the time this document revision is published.\n9.2 Identification commands\n9.2.1 Read identification - REMS (Read_ID or REMS 90h)\nThe READ_ID command identifies the Device Manufacturer ID  and the Device ID. The command is also referred to \nas Read Electronic Manufacturer and device Signature (REMS). READ-ID (REMS) is only supported for backward \ncompatibility and should not be used for new software designs. New software designs should instead make use \nof the RDID command. \nThe command is initiated by shifting on SI the instru ction code “90h” followed by a 24-bit address of 00000h. \nFollowing this, the Manufacturer ID and th e Device ID are shifted out on SO starting at the falling edge of SCK after \naddress. The Manufacturer ID and the De vice ID are always shifted out with th e MSb first. If the 24-bit address is \nset to 000001h, then the Device ID is read out first follo wed by the Manufacturer ID. The Manufacturer ID and \nDevice ID output data toggles between address 000000H an d 000001H until terminated by a low to high transition \non CS# input. The maximum clock freque ncy for the READ_ID command is 133 MHz.\nFigure 47 READ_ID (90h) command sequence\nTable 42 Read_ID values\nDevice Manufacturer ID (hex) Device ID (hex)\nS25FL512S 01 19CS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase \n                                                \n7654321023  10  \n7654321076543210 \nInstruction (90h) Manufacturer ID Device ID Address\nDatasheet 84 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n9.2.2 Read identification (RDID 9Fh)\nThe Read Identification (RDID) command provides read access to manufacturer identification, device \nidentification, and Common Flash Interface (CFI) informat ion. The manufacturer identification is assigned by \nJEDEC. The CFI structure is defined by JEDEC standard. Th e device identification and CFI values are assigned by \nInfineon.\nThe JEDEC Common Flash Interface (CFI) specification defi nes a device information structure, which allows a \nvendor-specified software flash management program (drive r) to be used for entire families of flash devices. \nSoftware support can then be device-independent, JEDEC manufacturer ID independent, forward and \nbackward-compatible for the specified flash device famili es. System vendors can standardize their flash drivers \nfor long-term software compatibility by using the CFI values  to configure a family driver from the CFI information \nof the device in use.\nAny RDID command issued while a progra m, erase, or write cycle is in prog ress is ignored and has no effect on \nexecution of the program, erase, or  write cycle that is in progress.\nThe RDID instruction is shifted on SI. After the last bit of the RDID instruction is shifte d into the device, a byte of \nmanufacturer identification, two bytes of device iden tification, extended device identification, and CFI \ninformation will be shifted sequentia lly out on SO. As a whole this inform ation is referred to as ID-CFI. See “ID-CFI \naddress space” on page 54 for the detail description of the ID-CFI contents. \nContinued shifting of output beyond the end of the defi ned ID-CFI address space will provide undefined data. The \nRDID command sequence is terminated  by driving CS# to the logic high state anytime during data output.\nThe maximum clock fr equency for the RDID command is 133 MHz.\nFigure 48 Read identification (RDID 9Fh) command sequenceCS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase76543210\n7654321076543210\nInstruction Data 1 Data N\nDatasheet 85 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n9.2.3 Read electronic signature (RES) (ABh)\nThe RES command is used to read a single byte Electronic Signature from SO. RES is only supported for backward \ncompatibility and should not be used for new software designs. New software designs should instead make use \nof the RDID command.\nThe RES instruction is shifted in followed by three dummy  bytes onto SI. After the last bit of the three dummy \nbytes are shifted into the device, a byte of Electronic Signat ure will be shifted out of SO. Each bit is shifted out by \nthe falling edge of SCK. Th e maximum clock frequency for the RES command is 50 MHz.\nThe Electronic Signature can be read repeatedly  by applying multiples of eight clock cycles.\nThe RES command sequence is terminated  by driving CS# to the logic high  state anytime during data output.\nFigure 49 Read electronic signature (RES ABh) command sequence\n9.2.4 Read serial flash discover able parameters (RSFDP 5Ah)\nThe command is initiated by shifting on SI the instru ction code ‘5Ah’ , followed by a 24-bit address of 000000h, \nfollowed by eight dummy cycles. The SFDP bytes are then sh ifted out on SO starting at the falling edge of SCK \nafter the eight dummy cycles. The SFDP bytes are always shif ted out with the MSb first. If the 24-bit address is set \nto any other value, the selected location in the SFDP sp ace is the starting point of the data read. This enables \nrandom access to any parameter in the SFDP space. The maximum clock frequency for the RSFDP command is \n133 MHz.\nFigure 50 RSFDP command sequenceTable 43 RES values\nDevice Device ID (hex)\nS25FL512S 19CS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase \n                                \n7654321023 10  \n76543210 \nInstruction (ABh)        Dummy Device ID\nCS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase \n                                                \n7654321023  10  \n76543 210 \nInstruction Address Dummy Cycles Data 1\nDatasheet 86 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n9.3 Register access commands\n9.3.1 Read status register-1 (RDSR1 05h)\nThe Read Status Register-1 (RDSR1) command allows the Status Register-1 contents to be read from SO. The \nStatus Register-1 contents may be read at any time, even while a program, erase, or write operation is in progress. \nIt is possible to read the Status Register-1 continuously by providing multiples of eigh t clock cycles. The status is \nupdated for each eight cycle read. The maximum cloc k frequency for the RDSR1 (05h) command is 133 MHz.\nFigure 51 Read status register-1 (RDSR1 05h) command sequence\n9.3.2 Read status register-2 (RDSR2 07h)\nThe Read Status Register (RDSR2) command allows the Status  Register-2 contents to be read from SO. The Status \nRegister-2 contents may be read at any time, even while a program, erase, or write operation is in progress. It is \npossible to read the Status Register-2 continuously by providing multiples of eight clock cycles. The status is \nupdated for each eight cycle read. The maximum clock frequency for the RDSR2 command is 133 MHz.\nFigure 52 Read status register-2 (RDSR2 07h) command sequence\n9.3.3 Read configuration register (RDCR 35h)\nThe Read Configuration Register (RDCR)  command allows the Configuration Register contents to be read from \nSO. It is possible to read the Configuration Register cont inuously by providing multiple s of eight clock cycles. The \nConfiguration Register contents may be read at any time, even while a program, erase, or write operation is in \nprogress.\nFigure 53 Read configuration register (RDCR 35h) command sequenceCS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase76543210\n7654321076543210\nInstruction Status    Updated Status\nCS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase76543210\n7654321076543210\nInstruction Status    Updated Status\nCS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase76543210\n7654321076543210\nInstruction Register Read Repeat Register Read\nDatasheet 87 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n9.3.4 Bank register read (BRRD 16h)\nThe Read the Bank Register (BRRD) command allows the Bank address Register contents to be read from SO. The \ninstruction is first shifted in from SI. Then the 8-bit Bank Register is shifted out on SO. It is possible to read the \nBank Register continuously by providing multiples of eight clock cycles. The maximu m operating clock frequency \nfor the BRRD command is 133 MHz.\nFigure 54 Read bank register (BRRD 16h) command\n9.3.5 Bank register write (BRWR 17h)\nThe Bank Register Write (BRWR) command is used to write address bits above A23, into  the Bank Address Register \n(BAR). The command is also used to write the Extended ad dress control bit (EXTADD) that is also in BAR[7]. BAR \nprovides the high order addresses needed by devices having more than 128 Mb ( 16 MB), when using 3-byte \naddress commands without extended addressing enabled (BAR[7] EXTADD = 0). Because this command is part of the addressing method and is not changing data in th e flash memory, this command does not require the WREN \ncommand to precede it.\nThe BRWR instruction is entered, followed by the data byte  on SI. The Bank Register is one data byte in length.\nThe BRWR command has no effect on the P_ERR, E_ERR or  WIP bits of the Status and Configuration Registers. \nAny bank address bit reserved for the fu ture should always be written as a 0.\nFigure 55 Bank register write (BRWR 17h) commandCS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n7 6 5 43 2 1 0 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\nInstruction Register Read Repeat Register Read\nCS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase7654321076543210\nInstruction Input Data\nDatasheet 88 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n9.3.6 Bank register access (BRAC B9h)\nThe Bank Register Read and Write commands provide full ac cess to the Bank Address Register (BAR) but they are \nboth commands that are not present in legacy SPI me mory devices. Host system SPI memory controller \ninterfaces may not be able to easi ly support such new comm ands. The Bank Register Access (BRAC) command \nuses the same command code and format as the Deep Po wer Down (DPD) command that is available in legacy \nSPI memories. The FL-S family does not support a DPD feat ure but assigns this legacy command code to the BRAC \ncommand to enable write access to the Bank Address Regist er for legacy systems that are able to send the legacy \nDPD (B9h) command.\nWhen the BRAC command is sent, the FL-S family devi ce will then interpret an immediately following Write \nRegister (WRR) command as a write to the lower address bits of the BAR. A WREN command is not used between \nthe BRAC and WRR commands. Only the lower two bits of  the first data byte following the WRR command code \nare used to load BAR[1:0]. The upper bits of that byte and the content of the optional WRR command second data \nbyte are ignored. Following the WRR command the access to  BAR is closed and the devi ce interface returns to the \nstandby state. The combined BRAC followed by WRR comm and sequence has no affect on the value of the ExtAdd \nbit (BAR[7]). \nCommands other than WRR may immediately follow BRAC and execute normally. However, any command other \nthan WRR, or any other sequence in which CS# goes LO W and returns HIGH, following a BRAC command, will close \nthe access to BAR and return to the normal interpretation  of a WRR command as a write to Status Register-1 and \nthe Configuration Register. \nThe BRAC + WRR sequence is allowed only when the devi ce is in standby, program suspend, or erase suspend \nstates. This command sequence is illegal when the devi ce is performing an embedded algorithm or when the \nprogram (P_ERR) or erase (E_ERR) status bits are set to ‘1’ .\nFigure 56 BRAC (B9h) command sequenceCS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase76543210\nInstruction\nDatasheet 89 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n9.3.7 Write registers (WRR 01h)\nThe Write Registers (WRR) command allows new values to be written to both the Status Register-1 and \nConfiguration Register. Before the Write Registers (WRR) command can be accepted by the device, a Write Enable \n(WREN) command must be received. After the Write Enable (WREN) command has been decoded successfully, \nthe device will set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) in the Status Register to enable any write operations.\nThe Write Registers (WRR) command is entered by shifting  the instruction and the data bytes on SI. The Status \nRegister is one data byte in length.\nThe Write Registers (WRR) command will set the P_ERR or E_ ERR bits if there is a failure in the WRR operation. \nAny Status or Configuration Register bit reserved for the future must be written as a ‘0’ .\nCS# must be driven to the logic high state after the eighth  or sixteenth bit of data has been latched. If not, the \nWrite Registers (WRR) command is not executed. If CS# is dr iven high after the eighth cycle then only the Status \nRegister-1 is written; otherwise, after the sixteenth cycl e both the Status and Configur ation Registers are written. \nWhen the configuration register QUAD bit CR[1] is ‘1’ , only the WRR command format with 16 data bits may be \nused. \nAs soon as CS# is driven to the logic HIGH state, the se lf-timed Write Registers (WRR) operation is initiated. While \nthe Write Registers (WRR) operation is in progress, the Stat us Register may still be read  to check the value of the \nWrite-In Progress (WIP) bit. The Write-In Progress (WIP) bi t is a ‘1’ during the self-timed Write Registers (WRR) \noperation, and is a ‘0’ when it is completed. When the Writ e Registers (WRR) operation is completed, the Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) is set to a ‘0’ . The WRR command mu st be executed under continuous power. The maximum \nclock frequency for the WRR command is 133 MHz.\nFigure 57 Write registers (WRR 01h) command sequence – 8 data bits\nFigure 58 Write registers (WRR 01h) command sequence – 16 data bits\nThe Write Registers (WRR) command allows the user to ch ange the values of the Block Protect (BP2, BP1, and \nBP0) bits to define the size of the area that is to be treated as read-only. The Write Registers (WRR) command also allows the user to set the Status Regist er Write Disable (SRWD) bit to a ‘1’ or a ‘0’ .

Attempts to write to the Status an d Configuration Registers are rejected, and are not \naccepted for execution. As a consequence, all the data by tes in the memory area that are protected by the Block \nProtect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits of the Status Register, are also hardware protected by WP#.\nThe WP# hardware protection can be provided:\n• by setting the Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit after driving Write Protect (WP#) signal to the logic LOW \nstate;\n• or by driving Write Protect (WP#) signal to the logic lo w state after setting the Status Register Write Disable \n(SRWD) bit to a ‘1’ .\nThe only way to release the hardware protection is to pu ll the Write Protect (WP#) signal to the logic HIGH state. \nIf WP# is permanently tied HIGH, hardware protection of the BP bits can never be activated. \nThe WRR command has an alternate function of loading the Bank Address Register if the command immediately \nfollows a BRAC command.

This  is followed by the number of dummy cycles selected by \nthe read latency value in CR2V[3:0]. Then the 8-bit cont ents of the ECC Register, for the ECC unit selected, are \nshifted out on SO 16 times, once for each byte in the ECC Unit. If CS# remains LOW the next ECC unit status is sent \nthrough SO/I/O1 16 times, once for each byte in the EC C Unit, this continues until CS# goes HIGH.

And, \nin order to read boot code from an SPI device, the host memory controller or processor must supply the read command from a hardwired state machine or from some host processor internal ROM code.\nParallel NOR devices need only an initia l address, supplied in parallel in a si ngle cycle, and initial access time to \nstart reading boot code.\nThe AutoBoot feature allows the host memory contro ller to take boot code from an S25FL512S device \nimmediately after the end of reset, without having to se nd a read command. This saves 32 or more cycles and \nsimplifies the logic n eeded to initiate the reading of boot code.\n• As part of the power up reset, hardware reset, or command reset process the AutoBoot feature automatically \nstarts a read access from a pre-specified address.

These are called Dual \nI/O for 2 bit and Quad I/O for 4 bit.\n• Some commands transfer address and data on both the rising edge and falling edge of SCK. These are called \nDouble Data Rate (DDR) commands.\n• There are DDR commands for 1, 2, or 4 bits of address or  data per SCK edge. These are called Fast DDR for 1-bit, \nDual I/O DDR for 2-bit, and Quad I/O DDR for 4-bit per edge transfer.CS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase7654321076543210\nInstruction Input Data\nCS#\nSCK\nSI\nSO\nPhase7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n7 6 5 43 2 1 0 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\nInstruction Data 1 Data N\nDatasheet 96 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\nAll of these commands begin with an instruction code that is transferred one bit per SCK rising edge. The \ninstruction is followed by either a 3- or 4-byte address transferred at SDR or DDR. Commands transferring address \nor data 2 or 4 bits per clock edge are called Multiple I/O (MIO) commands. For FL-S devices at 256 Mb or higher \ndensity, the traditional SPI 3-byte addresses are unable to directly address all locations in the memory array. \nThese device have a bank address register that is used with 3-byte address commands to supply the high order address bits beyond the address from the host system. The default bank address is zero. Commands are provided to load and read the bank address register. These devices may also be configured to take a 4-byte address from \nthe host system with the traditional 3-byte addres s commands. The 4-byte address mode for traditional \ncommands is activated by setting the External Address (EXTADD) bit in the bank address register to ‘1’ .\nThe Quad I/O commands provide a performance improvem ent option controlled by mode bits that are sent \nfollowing the address bits. The mode bits indicate whet her the command following the end of the current read \nwill be another read of the same type, without an instru ction at the beginning of the read. These mode bits give \nthe option to eliminate the instruction cycles when doing a series of Quad I/O read accesses.\nA device ordering option provides an enhanced high pe rformance option by adding a similar mode bit scheme \nto the DDR Fast Read, Dual I/O, and Dual I/O DDR commands, in addition to the Quad I/O command.\nSome commands require delay cycles following the address or mode bits to allow time to access the memory \narray. The delay cycles are traditionally called dummy cy cles. The dummy cycles are ignored by the memory thus \nany data provided by the host during thes e cycles is “don’t care” and the host may also leave the SI signal at high \nimpedance during the dummy cycles. When MIO commands ar e used the host must stop driving the I/O signals \n(outputs are high impedance) before the end of last dummy cycle. When DDR commands are used the host must \nnot drive the I/O signals during any dummy cycle. The numb er of dummy cycles varies with the SCK frequency or \nperformance option selected via the Configuration Register 1 (CR1) Latency Code (LC). Dummy cycles are measured from SCK falling edge to next SCK falling edge . SPI outputs are traditionally driven to a new value on \nthe falling edge of each SCK. Zero dummy cycles means th e returning data is driven by the memory on the same \nfalling edge of SCK that the host stops driving addres s or mode bits.\nThe DDR commands may optionally have an 8-edge Data Learning Pattern (DLP) driven by the memory, on all \ndata outputs, in the dummy cycles immediately before the start of data. The DLP can help the host memory \ncontroller determine the phase shift from SCK to data ed ges so that the memory controller can capture data at \nthe center of the data eye.\nWhen using SDR I/O commands at higher SCK frequencies (> 50 MHz), an LC that provides 1 or more dummy cycles \nshould be selected to allow additional time for the host to stop driving before the memory starts driving data, to \nminimize I/O driver conflict. When using DDR I/O commands with the DLP enabled, an LC  that provides 5 or more \ndummy cycles should be selected to allow 1 cycle of ad ditional time for the host to stop driving before the \nmemory starts driving the 4 cycle DLP .\nEach read command ends when CS# is returned HIGH at any point during data return. CS# must not be returned \nHIGH during the mode or dummy cycles before data returns as this may cause mode bits to be captured incorrectly; making it indeterminate as to whether the device remains in enhanced high performance read mode.\n9.4.1 Read (Read 03h or 4READ 13h)\nThe instruction \n• 03h (ExtAdd = 0) is followed by a 3-byte address (A23–A0) or\n• 03h (ExtAdd = 1) is followed by a 4-byte address (A31–A0) or\n• 13h is followed by a 4-byte address (A31–A0)\nThen the memory contents, at the address given, are sh ifted out on SO.

It is similar to \nthe Dual Output Read command but takes input of the addr ess two bits per SCK rising edge. In some applications, \nthe reduced address input time might allow for code executio n in place (XIP) i.e. directly from the memory device.\nThe maximum operating clock freque ncy for Dual I/O Read is 104 MHz.\nFor the Dual I/O Read command, there is a latency required after the last address bits are shifted into SI and SO \nbefore data begins shifting out of I/O0 and I/O1. There ar e different ordering part numbers that select the latency \ncode table used for this command, either the High Performance LC (HPLC) table or the Enhanced High \nPerformance LC (EHPLC) table. The HPLC table does not provide cycles for mode bits so each Dual I/O Read \ncommand starts with the 8 bit instruction, follo wed by address, followed by a latency period.\nThis latency period (dummy cycles) allows the device intern al circuitry enough time to access data at the initial \naddress. During the dummy cycles, the data value on SI and SO are “don’t care” and may be high impedance. The \nnumber of dummy cycles is determ ined by the frequency of SCK ( Table 24 ). The number of dummy cycles is set \nby the LC bits in the Co nfiguration Register (CR1).\nThe EHPLC table does provide cycles for mode bits so a series of Dual I/O Read commands may eliminate the 8-bit \ninstruction after the first Dual I/O Read command sends a mode bit pattern of Axh that indicates the following \ncommand will also be a Dual I/O Read command. The first Du al I/O Read command in a series starts with the 8-bit \ninstruction, followed by address, followed by four cycles of mode bits, followed by a latency period. If the mode bit pattern is Axh the next command is assumed to be an additional Dual I/O Read command that does not \nprovide instruction bits. That command starts with address, followed by mode bits, followed by latency.\nThe Enhanced High Performance feature removes the need  for the instruction sequence and greatly improves \ncode execution (XIP). The upper nibble (bits 7–4) of the Mode bits control th e length of the next Dual I/O Read \ncommand through the inclusion or exclusion of the first by te instruction code. The lower nibble (bits 3–0) of the \nMode bits are “don’t care” (“x”) and may be high impedance. If the Mode bits equal Axh, then the device remains in Dual I/O Enhanced High Performance Read Mode and the next address can be entered (after CS# is raised HIGH \nand then asserted low) without the BB h or BCh instruction, as shown in Figure 81 ; thus, eliminating eight cycles \nfor the command sequence. The following sequences will  release the device from Dual I/O Enhanced High \nPerformance Read mode; after which, the device can accept standard SPI commands:\n1. During the Dual I/O Enhanced High Performance Comman d Sequence, if the Mode bits are any value other than \nAxh, then the next time CS# is raised HIGH the device  will be released from Dual I/O Read Enhanced High \nPerformance Read mode.\nDuring any operation, if CS# toggles HIGH to LOW to HIGH  for eight cycles (or less) and data input (I/O0 and I/O1) \nare not set for a valid instruction sequence, then the de vice will be released from Dual I/O Enhanced High \nPerformance Read mode. Note that the four mode bit cycles are part of the device’s internal circuitry latency time to access the initial address after the last address cycle that is cloc ked into I/O0 (SI) and I/O1 (SO).\nIt is important that the I/O signals be set to high-impedance at or before the falling edge of the first data out clock. \nAt higher clock speeds the time availabl e to turn off the host outputs before the memory device begins to drive \n(bus turn around) is diminished. It is allowed and may be helpful in preventing I/O signal contention, for the host system to turn off the I/O signal ou tputs (make them high impedance) during the last two “don’t care” mode \ncycles or during any dummy cycles.\nFollowing the latency period the memory content, at the ad dress given, is shifted out two bits at a time through \nI/O0 (SI) and I/O1 (SO). Two bits are shifted out at the SCK frequency at the falling edge of SCK signal.\nThe address can start at any byte location of the memory  array.

It is similar to the Quad \nOutput Read command but allows input of the address bits four bits per serial SCK clock. In some applications, \nthe reduced instruction overhead might allow for code execution (XIP) directly from the S25FL512S device. The \nQUAD bit of the Configuration Register must be set (CR Bit1 = 1) to enable  the Quad capability of the S25FL512S \ndevice.\nThe maximum operating clock freque ncy for Quad I/O Read is 104 MHz.\nFor the Quad I/O Read command, there is a latency required  after the mode bits (described below) before data \nbegins shifting out of I/O0–I/O3. This latency period (i.e., dummy cycles) allows the device’s internal circuitry enough time to access data at the initial address. During  latency cycles, the data value on I/O0–I/O3 are “don’t \ncare” and may be high impedance. The number of dummy cycles is determined by th e frequency of SCK and the \nlatency code table (refer to Table 24 ). There are different ordering part numbers that select the latency code \ntable used for this command, either the High Performanc e LC (HPLC) table or the Enhanced High Performance \nLC (EHPLC) table. The number of dummy cycles is set by the LC bits in the Configuration Register (CR1). However, \nboth latency code tables use the same late ncy values for the Quad I/O Read command.\nFollowing the latency period, the memory contents at the a ddress given, is shifted out four bits at a time through \nI/O0-I/O3. Each nibble (4 bits) is shifted out at th e SCK frequency by the falling edge of the SCK signal.\nThe address can start at any byte location of the memory  array. The address is auto matically incremented to the \nnext higher address in sequential order after each byte of data is shifted out. The entire memory can therefore \nbe read out with one single read instruction and addr ess 000000h provided. When the hi ghest address is reached, \nthe address counter will wrap around and roll back to 000000h, allowing the read sequence to be continued \nindefinitely.\nAddress jumps can be done without the need for additional Quad I/O Read instructions. This is controlled through \nthe setting of the Mode bits (after  the address sequence, as shown in Figure 84  or Figure 85 ). This added feature \nremoves the need for the instruction sequence and greatl y improves code execution (X IP). The upper nibble (bits \n7-4) of the Mode bits contro l the length of the next Quad I/O instructio n through the inclusion or exclusion of the \nfirst byte instruction code. The lower nibble (bits 3–0) of th e Mode bits are “don’t care” (“x”). If the Mode bits equal \nAxh, then the device remains in Quad I/O High Performanc e Read Mode and the next address can be entered (after \nCS# is raised HIGH and then asserted LOW) without requiring the EBh or ECh in struction, as shown in Figure 83  \nor Figure 85 ; thus, eliminating eight cycles for the command sequence. The following sequences will release the \ndevice from Quad I/O High Performance Read mode; after which, the device can accept standard SPI commands:\n1. During the Quad I/O Read Command Sequence, if the Mo de bits are any value other than Axh, then the next \ntime CS# is raised HIGH the device will be released from Quad I/O High Performance Read mode.\nDuring any operation, if CS# toggles HIGH to LOW to HIGH  for eight cycles (or less) and data input (I/O0–I/O3) are \nnot set for a valid instruction sequence, then the device will be released from Quad I/O High Performance Read \nmode. Note that the two mode bit clock cycles and addition al wait states (i.e., dummy cycles) allow the device’s \ninternal circuitry latency time to access the initial ad dress after the last address cycle that is clocked into \nI/O0–I/O3.\nIt is important that the I/O0–I/O3 signals be set to high-i mpedance at or before the falling edge of the first data \nout clock. At higher clock speeds the time available to tu rn off the host outputs before the memory device begins \nto drive (bus turn around) is dimini shed. It is allowed and may be help ful in preventing I/O0–I/O3 signal \ncontention, for the host system to turn off the I/O0–I/O 3 signal outputs (make them high impedance) during the \nlast “don’t care” mode cycle or during any dummy cycles.\nCS# should not be driven HIGH during mode or dummy bits as this may make the mode bits indeterminate.\nDatasheet 103 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\nFigure 82 Quad I/O read command sequence (3-byte address, EBh [ExtAdd = 0], LC = 00b)\nFigure 83 Continuous quad I/O read comma nd sequence (3-byte address), LC = 00b\nFigure 84 Quad I/O read command sequence(4-byte address, ECh or EBh [ExtAdd = 1], LC = 00b)\nFigure 85 Continuous quad I/O read comma nd sequence (4-byte address), LC = 00bCS#\nSCK\nIO0IO1\nIO2\nIO3\nPhase \n                                                     \n7654321020  4040 40404040  \n21  5151 51515151  \n22  6262 62626262  \n23  7373 73737373  \nInstruction Address Mode Dummy D1 D2 D3 D4\nCS#\nSCK\nIO0IO1\nIO2\nIO3\nPhase  \n                                                  \n40 4 0 20  4 0 4 0 4 0 4 06 4 2 0  \n51 5 1 21  5 1 5 1 5 1 5 17 5 3 1 \n6 2 6 2 22  6 2 6 2 6 26 1 7 5 3 1 \n7 3 7 3 23  7 3 7 3 7 37 1 7 5 3 1 \nDN-1 D N Address Mode Dummy D1 D  2 D 3 D 4\nCS#\nSCK\nIO0IO1\nIO2\nIO3\nPhase \n                                                     \n7654321028  4040 40404040  \n29  5151 51515151  \n30  6262 62626262  \n31  7373 73737373  \nInstruction Address Mode Dummy D 1 D 2 D 3 D 4\nCS#\nSCK\nIO0IO1\nIO2\nIO3\nPhase  \n                                                  \n40 4 0 28  4 0 4 0 4 0 4 06 4 2 0  \n51 5 1 29  5 1 5 1 5 1 5 17 5 3 1 \n6 2 6 2 30  6 2 6 2 6 26 1 7 5 3 1 \n7 3 7 3 31  7 3 7 3 7 37 1 7 5 3 1 \nDN-1 D N Address Mode Dummy D 1 D 2 D 3 D 4\nDatasheet 104 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n9.4.7 DDR fast read (DDRFR 0Dh, 4DDRFR 0Eh)\nThe instruction \n• 0Dh (ExtAdd = 0) is followed by a 3-byte address (A23–A0) or• 0Dh (ExtAdd = 1) is followed by a 4-byte address (A31–A0) or\n•0 E h  i s  f o l l o w e d  b y  a  4-byte address (A31–A0)\nThe DDR Fast Read command improves throughput by transferring address and data on both the falling and \nrising edge of SCK. It is similar to the Fast Read command but allows transfer of address and data on every edge of the clock.\nThe maximum operating clock frequency for DDR Fast Read command is 80 MHz.\nFor the DDR Fast Read command, there is a latency required after the last address bits are shifted into SI before \ndata begins shifting out of SO. There are different orderi ng part numbers that select the latency code table used \nfor this command, either the High Performance LC (HPLC)  table or the Enhanced High Performance LC (EHPLC) \ntable. The HPLC table does not provide cycles for mode bits so each DDR Fast Read command starts with the 8-bit instruction, followed by address, followed by a latency period.\nThis latency period (dummy cycles) allows the device intern al circuitry enough time to access data at the initial \naddress. During the dummy cycles, the data value on SI is “don’t care” and may be high impedance. The number \nof dummy cycles is determined  by the frequency of SCK (see Table 24 ). The number of dummy cycles is set by \nthe LC bits in the Configuration Register (CR1).\nThen the memory contents, at the address given, is shifte d out, in DDR fashion, one bit at a time on each clock \nedge through SO. Each bit is shifted out at the SCK freq uency by the rising and falli ng edge of the SCK signal.\nThe address can start at any byte location of the memory  array. The address is auto matically incremented to the \nnext higher address in sequential order after each byte of data is shifted out. The entire memory can therefore \nbe read out with one single read instruction and addr ess 000000h provided. When the hi ghest address is reached, \nthe address counter will wrap around and roll back to 000000h, allowing the read sequence to be continued \nindefinitely.\nThe EHPLC table does provide cycles for mode bits so a series of DDR Fast Read commands may eliminate the \n8-bit instruction after the first DDR Fast Read command  sends a mode bit pattern of complementary first and \nsecond Nibbles, e.g. A5h, 5Ah, 0Fh, etc., that indicate s the following command will also be a DDR Fast Read \ncommand. The first DDR Fast Read command in a series starts with the 8-bit instruction, followed by address, followed by four cycles of mode bits, followed by a latency period. If the mode bit pattern is complementary the next command is assumed to be an additional DDR Fast  Read command that does not provide instruction bits. \nThat command starts with address, followed by mode bits, followed by latency.\nWhen the EHPLC table is used, address jumps can be do ne without the need for additional DDR Fast Read \ninstructions. This is controlled through the setting of the Mode bits (after the ad dress sequence, as shown in \nFigure 89  and Figure 88 . This added feature removes the need for the eight bit SDR instruction sequence to \nreduce initial access time (improves XIP performance). The Mode bits control the length of the next DDR Fast Read \noperation through the inclusion or exclus ion of the first byte instruction code. If the upper nibble (I/O[7:4]) and \nlower nibble (I/O[3:0]) of the Mode bits are complementar y (i.e. 5h and Ah) then the next address can be entered \n(after CS# is raised HIGH and then asserted LOW) without requiring the 0D h or 0Eh instruction, as shown in \nFigure 89 , thus, eliminating eight cycles from the command sequence. The following sequences will release the \ndevice from this continuous DDR Fast Read mode; after which, the device can accept standard SPI commands:\n1. During the DDR Fast Read Command Sequence, if the Mo de bits are not complementary the next time CS# is \nraised HIGH the device will be released from the continuous DDR Fast Read mode.\n2. During any operation, if CS# toggles HIGH to LOW to HIGH for eight cycles (or less) and data input (SI) are not \nset for a valid instruction sequence, then the device will be released from DDR Fast Read mode. \nCS# should not be driven HIGH during mode or dummy bits as this may make the mode bits indeterminate.\nThe HOLD function is not valid during any part of a Fast DDR Command. \nDatasheet 105 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\nAlthough the data learning pattern (DLP) is programmab le, the following example shows example of the DLP of \n34h.

This pattern was chosen to cover both DC and AC data transition scenarios. The two DC transition scenario s include data low for a long period of time (two half \nclocks) followed by a high going transition (001) and the complementary low going transition (110). The two AC \ntransition scenarios include data low for a short period of time (one half clock) followed by a high going transition (101) and the complementary low going transition (010). Th e DC transitions will typically occur with a starting \npoint closer to the supply rail than the AC transitions that may not have fu lly settled to their steady state (DC) \nlevels. In many cases the DC transitions will bound the be ginning of the data valid period and the AC transitions \nwill bound the ending of the data valid period. These tr ansitions will allow the host controller to identify the \nbeginning and ending of the valid data eye.

When the Da ta Learning Pattern (DLP) is enabled the host system \nmust not drive the I/O signals during the dummy cycles. The I/O signals must be left high impedance by the host so that the memory device can driv e the DLP during the dummy cycles.\nThe EHPLC table does provide cycles for mode bits so a series of Dual I/O DDR comm ands may eliminate the 8 bit \ninstruction after the first command sends a co mplementary mode bit pattern, as shown in Figure 91  and \nFigure 93 .

The \nHOLD function is not valid during Dual I/O DDR commands.\nNote that the memory devices may drive the I/Os with a preamble prior to the first data value. The preamble is a \ndata learning pattern (DLP) that is used by the host controller to optimize data capture at higher frequencies. The preamble DLP drives the I/O bus for the four clock cycles immediately before data is output. The host must be sure to stop driving the I/O bus prior to the time  that the memory starts outputting the preamble.\nThe preamble is intended to give the host controller an indication about the round trip time from when the host \ndrives a clock edge to when the corresponding data valu e returns from the memory device. The host controller \nwill skew the data capture point during the preamble pe riod to optimize timing margins and then use the same \nskew time to capture the data during the rest of th e read operation. The optimized capture point will be \ndetermined during the preamble period of every read op eration. This optimization strategy is intended to \ncompensate for both the PVT (process, voltage, temperatur e) of both the memory device and the host controller \nas well as any system level delays caused by flight time on the PCB.\nAlthough the data learning pattern (DLP) is programmab le, the following example shows example of the DLP of \n34h. The DLP 34h (or 00110100) will be driven on each of the ac tive outputs (i.e. all four SIOs on a x4 device, both \nSIOs on a x2 device and the single SO output on a x1 device). This pattern was chosen to cover both DC and AC data transition scenarios. The two DC transition scenario s include data low for a long period of time (two half \nclocks) followed by a high going transition (001) and the complementary low going transition (110). The two AC \ntransition scenarios include data low for a short period of time (one half clock) followed by a high going transition (101) and the complementary low going transition (010). Th e DC transitions will typically occur with a starting \npoint closer to the supply rail than the AC transitions that may not have fu lly settled to their steady state (DC) \nlevels.

The QUAD \nbit of the Configuration Register must be set (CR Bit1 = 1) to enable the Quad capability.\nThe instruction \n• EDh (ExtAdd = 0) is followed by a 3-byte address (A23–A0) or\n• EDh (ExtAdd = 1) is followed by a 4-byte address (A31–A0) or\n• EEh is followed by a 4-byte address (A31–A0)\nThe address is followed by mode bits. Then the memory contents, at the addr ess given, is shifted out, in a DDR \nfashion, with four bits at a time on each clock edge through I/O0–I/O3.\nThe maximum operating clock frequency for Read DDR Quad I/O command is 80 MHz.\nFor Read DDR Quad I/O, there is a latency required afte r the last address and mode bits are shifted into the \nI/O0–I/O3 signals before data begins shifting out of I/ O0–I/O3. This latency period (dummy cycles) allows the \ndevice’s internal circuitry enough time to access the in itial address. During these la tency cycles, the data value \non I/O0–I/O3 are “don’t care” and may be high impedance.  When the Data Learning Pattern (DLP) is enabled the \nhost system must not drive the I/O signals during the dummy cycles. The I/O signals must be left high impedance by the host so that the memory device can drive the DLP during the dummy cycles.\nThere are different ordering part numbers that select th e latency code table used for this command, either the \nHigh Performance LC (HPLC) table or the Enhanced High  Performance LC (EHPLC) table. The number of dummy \ncycles is determined by the frequency of SCK (refer to Table 23 ). The number of dummy cycles is set by the LC \nbits in the Configuration Register (CR1).\nBoth latency tables provide cycles for mode bits so a series of Quad I/O DDR commands may eliminate the 8 bit \ninstruction after the first command sends a co mplementary mode bit pattern, as shown in Figure 94  and \nFigure 96 . This feature removes the need for the eight bit SDR instruction sequence and dramatically reduces \ninitial access times (improves XIP performance). The Mode bi ts control the length of the next Read DDR Quad I/O \noperation through the inclusion or exclus ion of the first byte instruction code. If the upper nibble (I/O[7:4]) and \nlower nibble (I/O[3:0]) of the Mode bits are complementar y (i.e. 5h and Ah) the device transitions to Continuous \nRead DDR Quad I/O Mode and the next address can be ente red (after CS# is raised high and then asserted low) \nwithout requiring the EDh or EE h instruction, as shown in Figure 95  and Figure 97  thus, eliminating eight cycles \nfrom the command sequence. The following sequences will  release the device from Continuous Read DDR Quad \nI/O mode; after which, the device can accept standard SPI commands:\n1. During the Read DDR Quad I/O Command Sequence, if th e Mode bits are not complementary the next time CS# \nis raised HIGH and then asserted LOW the device will be released from Read DDR Quad I/O mode.\n2. During any operation, if CS# toggles HIGH to LOW to HIGH for eight cycles (or less) and data input (I/O0, I/O1, \nI/O2, and I/O3) are not set for a valid instruction sequence, then the device will be released from Read DDR Quad I/O mode. \nThe address can start at any byte location of the memory  array. The address is auto matically incremented to the \nnext higher address in sequential order after each byte of data is shifted out. The entire memory can therefore \nbe read out with one single read instruction and addr ess 000000h provided. When the hi ghest address is reached, \nthe address counter will wrap around and roll back to 000000h, allowing the read sequence to be continued \nindefinitely.\nCS# should not be driven HIGH during mode or dummy bi ts as this may make the mode bits indeterminate. The \nHOLD function is not valid during Quad I/O DDR commands.\nNote that the memory devices drive the I/Os with a preamble prior to the first data value. The preamble is a \npattern that is used by the host controller to optimize data capture at higher frequencies. The preamble drives \nthe I/O bus for the four clock cycles immediately before data  is output. The host must be sure to stop driving the \nI/O bus prior to the time that the me mory starts outputting the preamble.\nDatasheet 109 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\nThe preamble is intended to give the host controller an indication about the round trip time from when the host \ndrives a clock edge to when the corresponding data valu e returns from the memory device. The host controller \nwill skew the data capture point during the preamble pe riod to optimize timing margins and then use the same \nskew time to capture the data during the rest of th e read operation. The optimized capture point will be \ndetermined during the preamble period of every read op eration. This optimization strategy is intended to \ncompensate for both the PVT (process, voltage, temperatur e) of both the memory device and the host controller \nas well as any system level delays caused by flight time on the PCB.\nAlthough the data learning pattern (DLP) is programmab le, the following example shows example of the DLP of \n34h. The DLP 34h (or 00110100) will be driven on each of the ac tive outputs (i.e. all four SIOs on a x4 device, both \nSIOs on a x2 device and the single SO output on a x1 device). This pattern was chosen to cover both DC and AC \ndata transition scenarios. The two DC transition scenario s include data low for a long period of time (two half \nclocks) followed by a high going transition (001) and the complementary low going transition (110). The two AC \ntransition scenarios include data low for a short period of time (one half clock) followed by a high going transition (101) and the complementary low going transition (010). Th e DC transitions will typically occur with a starting \npoint closer to the supply rail than the AC transitions that may not have fu lly settled to their steady state (DC) \nlevels. In many cases the DC transitions will bound the be ginning of the data valid period and the AC transitions \nwill bound the ending of the data valid period. These tr ansitions will allow the host controller to identify the \nbeginning and ending of the valid data eye. Once the da ta eye has been characterized the optimal data capture \npoint can be chosen. See “SPI DDR data learning registers” on page 69 for more details.\nFigure 94 DDR quad I/O read initial access (3-byte address, EDh [ExtAdd = 0], HPLC = 11b)\nFigure 95 Continuous DDR quad  I/O read subsequent access (3-byte address, HPLC = 11b)CS#\nSCK\nIO0\nIO1IO2IO3\nPhase \n                                           \n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 201612 84040 765432104040\n211713 95151 765432105151\n22181410 6262 765432106262\n23191511 7373 765432107373\nInstruction Address Mode Dummy DLP D1 D2\nCS#\nSCK\nIO0\nIO1\nIO2 \n                         \n201612 84040 4040404040\n211713 95151 5151515151\n22181410 6262 6262626262\nDatasheet 110 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\nFigure 96 DDR quad I/O read initial access (4-byte address, EEh or EDh [ExtAdd = 1], EHPLC = 01b)[48]\nFigure 97 Continuous DDR quad  I/O read subsequent access (4-byte address, EHPLC = 01b)[48]CS#\nSCK\nIO0\nIO1\nIO2\nIO3\nPhase \n                                            \n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2.2.2.1.1.84040 7  6 5  4 321  0 4040\n2.2.2.1.1.95151 7  6 5  4 321  0 5151\n3.2.2.1.1.1.6262 7  6 5  4 321  0 6262\n3.2.2.1.1.1.7373 7  6 5  4 321  0 7373\nInstruction Address Mod .Dummy DLP D1 D2\nCS#\nSCK\nIO0\nIO1\nIO2\nIO3\nPhase \n                             \n2824201612 84040 7   6 5   4 321   0 40404\n2925211713 95151 7   6 5   4 321   0 51515\n302622181410 6262 7   6 5   4 321   0 62626\n312723191511 7373 7   6 5   4 321   0 73737\nAddress Mode Dummy DLP D1 D2\nNote\n48.Example DLP of 34h (or 00110100).\nDatasheet 111 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\n9.5 Program flash array commands\n9.5.1 Program granularity9.5.1.1 Automatic ECC\nEach 16 byte aligned and 16 byte length  Programming Block has an  automatic Error Correction Code (ECC) value. \nThe data block plus ECC form an ECC unit. In combination with Error Detection and Correction (EDC) logic the ECC is used to detect and correct any single bit error found during a read access. When data is first programmed within an ECC unit the ECC value is set for the entire ECC unit. If the same ECC unit is programmed more than once \nthe ECC value is changed to disable the EDC function. A se ctor erase is needed to again enable Automatic ECC on \nthat Programming Block. The 16 byte Program Block is th e smallest program granularity on which Automatic ECC \nis enabled.\nThese are automatic operations transparent to the us er. The transparency of the Automatic ECC feature \nenhances data accuracy for typical programming operat ions which write data once to each ECC unit but, \nfacilitates software compatibility to previous generations of FL family of products by allowing for single byte \nprogramming and bit walking in which the same ECC unit is programmed more than once. When an ECC unit has \nAutomatic ECC disabled, EDC is not done on  data read from the ECC unit location.\nAn ECC status register is provided for determining if ECC is enabled on an ECC unit and whether any errors have \nbeen detected and corrected in the ECC unit data or the ECC (See “ECC status register (ECCSR)” on page 66.) \nThe ECC Status Register Read (ECCRD) command is used to read the ECC status on any ECC unit.\nError Detection and Correction (EDC) is applied to all part s of the Flash address spaces  other than registers. An \nError Correction Code (ECC) is calculated for each group of  bytes protected and the ECC is stored in a hidden area \nrelated to the group of bytes. The group of protected by tes and the related ECC are together called an ECC unit.\nECC is calculated for each 16 byte aligned and length ECC unit.\n• Single Bit EDC is supported with 8 ECC bits per ECC unit, plus 1 bit for an ECC disable Flag.• Sector erase resets all ECC bits and ECC disable flags in a sector to the default state (enabled).\n• ECC is programmed as part of the standard Program commands operation.\n• ECC is disabled automatically if multiple progra mming operations are done on the same ECC unit.\n• Single byte programming or bit walking is allowed but disables ECC on the second program to the same 16-byte \nECC unit.\n• The ECC disable flag is programmed when ECC is disabled.\n• To re-enable ECC for an ECC unit that has been disabled, the Sector that includes th e ECC unit must be erased.\n• To ensure the best data integrity provided by EDC, each ECC unit should be programmed only once so that ECC \nis stored for that unit and not disabled.\n• The calculation, programming, and disabling of ECC is done automatically as part of a programming operation. \nThe detection and correction, if needed, is done automatica lly as part of read operations. The host system sees \nonly corrected data from a read operation.\n• ECC protects the OTP region - however a second program operation on the same ECC unit will disable ECC \npermanently on that ECC unit (OTP is one time progra mmable, hence an erase operation to re-enable the ECC \nenable/indicator bit is prohibited).\n9.5.1.2 Page programming\nPage Programming is done by loading a Page Buffer with data to be programmed and issuing a programming command to move data from the buffer to the memory array.  This sets an upper limit on the amount of data that \ncan be programmed with a single programming comman d. Page Programming allows up to a page size \n(512 bytes) to be programmed  in one operation. The page  is aligned on the page size address boundary. It is \npossible to program from one bit up to a page size in each Page programming operation. It is recommended that a multiple of 16 byte length and aligned Program Blocks be written. For the very best performance, programming \nDatasheet 112 001-98284 Rev. *T\n2023-08-30 \n512 Mb (64 MB) FL-S Flash\nSPI Multi-I/O, 3.0 V\nCommands\nshould be done in full pages of 512 bytes aligned on 512- byte boundaries with each Page being programmed only \nonce.\n9.5.1.3 Single byte programming\nSingle Byte Programming allows full backward compat ibility to the standard SPI Page Programming (PP) \ncommand by allowing a single byte to be programmed anywhere in the memory array. While single byte \nprogramming is supported, this will disable Automatic ECC on the 16 byte ECC unit where the byte is located.\n9.5.2 Page program (PP 02h or 4PP 12h)\nThe Page Program (PP) commands allows bytes to be programmed in the memory (changing bits from ‘1’ to ‘0’). Before the Page Program (PP) commands can be accepted by the device, a Write Enable (WREN) command must be issued and decoded by the device. After the Write Enable (WREN) command has been decoded successfully, the device sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL) in the Status Register to enable any write operations.\nThe instruction \n• 02h (ExtAdd = 0) is followed by a 3-byte address (A23–A0) or\n• 02h (ExtAdd = 1) is followed by a 4-byte address (A31–A0) or\n• 12h is followed by a 4-byte address (A31–A0)\nand at least one data byte on SI. Up to a page can be provided on SI after the 3-byte address with instruction 02h \nor 4-byte address with instruction 12h has been provided. If the 9 least significant address bits (A8–A0) are not all \nzero, all transmitted data that goes beyond the end of the current page are programmed from the start address \nof the same page (from the address whose 9 least significan t bits (A8–A0) are all zero) i. e. the address wraps within \nthe page aligned address boundaries. This is a result of only requiring the user to enter one single page address \nto cover the entire page boundary.\nIf less than a page of data is sent to the device, these data bytes will be programmed in sequence, starting at the \nprovided address within the page, without having any affect on th e other bytes of the same page.\nFor optimized timings, using the Page Program (PP) command  to load the entire page size program buffer within \nthe page boundary will save overall programming time versus loading less than a page size into the program buffer.\nThe programming process is managed by the flash memory  device internal control logic. After a programming \ncommand is issued, the programming operation status can be checked using the Read Status Register-1 \ncommand. The WIP bit (SR1[0]) will indicate when th e programming operation is completed. The P_ERR bit \n(SR1[6]) will indicate if an error occurs in the progra mming operation that prevents  successful completion of \nprogramming.\nFigure 98 Page program (PP 02h or 4PP 12h) command sequence\n9.5.3 Quad page program (QPP 32h or 38h, or 4QPP 34h)\nThe Quad-input Page Program (QPP) command allows by tes to be programmed in the memory (changing bits \nfrom 1 to 0). The Quad-input Page Program (QPP) command allows up to a page size (512 bytes) of data to be \nloaded into the Page Buffer using four signals: I/O0–I/O3. QPP can improve performance for PROM Programmer and applications that have slower clock speeds (< 12 MHz) by  loading 4 bits of data per clock cycle.

Erase Resume commands will be  ignored unless an Erase operation is suspended.\nSee Table 45  for the commands allowed while erase is suspend.\nAfter the erase operation has been suspended, the sector  enters the erase-suspend mode. The system can read \ndata from or program data to the device. Reading at any address within an erase-suspended sector produces \nundetermined data. \nA WREN command is required before any command that will change non-volatile data, even during erase \nsuspend.\nThe WRR and PPB Erase commands are not allowed during Eras e Suspend, it is therefore not possible to alter the \nBlock Protection or PPB bits during Erase Suspend. If th ere are sectors that may need programming during Erase \nsuspend, these sectors should be prot ected only by DYB bits that can be turned off during Erase Suspend. \nHowever, WRR is allowed immediately following the BRAC command; in this special ca se the WRR is interpreted \nas a write to the Bank Address Register, not a write to SR1 or CR1.\nIf a program command is sent for a location within an er ase suspended sector the program operation will fail with \nthe P_ERR bit set.\nAfter an erase-suspended program operation is complete , the device returns to th e erase-suspend mode.

The protocol of the OTP \nProgram command is the same as the Page Program command. Before the OTP Program command can be accepted by the device, a Write Enable (WREN) command must be issued and decoded by the device, which sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL) in the Status Register to enable any write operations.\nTo program the OTP array in bit granularity, the rest of the bits within a data byte can be set to ‘1’ .Each region in the OTP memory space can be programmed one or more times, provided  that the region is not \nlocked. Attempting to program zeros in a region that is locked will fail with the P_ERR bit in SR1 set to ‘1’ \nProgramming ones, even in a protected area does not ca use an error and does not set P_ERR.

Then the 8-bit DYB access register contents  are shifted out on the seri al output SO. Each bit is \nshifted out at the SCK frequency by the falling edge of th e SCK signal. It is possible to read the same DYB access \nregister continuously by providing mu ltiples of eight clock cycles. The address of the DYB register does not \nincrement so this is not a means to read the entire DYB array. Each location must be read with a separate DYB Read command.

The Freeze \nbit and the PPB Lock bit will remain set at their last value prior to the software reset. To clear the FREEZE bit and \nset the PPB Lock bit to its protection mode selected power on state, a full power-on-reset sequence or hardware reset must be done. Note that the non-volatile bits in the configuration register, TBPROT , TBPARM, and BPNV, \nretain their previous state after a Software Reset. The Bl ock Protection bits BP2, BP1, and BP0, in the status \nregister will only be reset if they are configured as vola tile via the BPNV bit in the Configuration Register (CR1[3]) \nand FREEZE is cleared to zero. The software reset cannot be used to circumvent the FREEZE or PPB Lock bit protection mechanisms for the other security configurat ion bits. The reset command is executed when CS# is \nbrought to HIGH state and requires t\nRPH time to execute.\nFigure 120 Software reset (RESET F0h) command sequence\n9.9.2 Mode bit reset (MBR FFh)\nThe Mode Bit Reset (MBR) command can be used to return  the device from continuous high performance read \nmode back to normal standby awaiting any new comma nd. Because some device packages lack a hardware \nRESET# input and a device that is in a continuous high performance read mode may not recognize any normal SPI command, a system hardware reset or software reset command may not be recognized by the device.

One Basic Flash parameter is mandated by the JEDEC JESD216B standard. Two \noptional parameter tables for Sector Map and 4 Byte Addr ess Instructions follow the Basic Flash table. Infineon \nprovides an additional parameter by pointing to the ID-CFI  address space i.e. the ID-CFI address space is a sub-set \nof the SFDP address space. The parameter tables portion of  the SFDP data structure are located within the ID-CFI \naddress space and is thus both a CFI parameter and an SFDP parameter. In this way both SFDP and ID-CFI \ninformation can be accessed by either the RSFDP or RDID commands.D8 SE Erase 256 kB (3- or 4-byte \naddress)133\nDC 4SE Erase 256 kB (4-byte \naddress)133\nE0 DYBRD DYB Read 133\nE1 DYBWR DYB Write 133\nE2 PPBRD PPB Read 133\nE3 PPBP PPB Program 133E4 PPBE PPB Erase 133\nE5 Reserved-E5 Reserved –\nE6 Reserved-E6 Reserved –E7 PASSRD Password Read 133\nE8 PASSP Password Program 133\nE9 PASSU Password Unlock 133\nEB QIOR Quad I/O Read (3- or 4-byte \naddress)104\nEC 4QIOR Quad I/O Read (4-byte \naddress)104\nED DDRQIOR DDR Quad I/O Read (3- or \n4-byte address)80\nEE 4DDRQIOR DDR Quad I/O Read (4-byte \naddress)80\nF0 RESET Software Reset 133\nFF MBR Mode Bit Reset 133\nTable 52 SFDP overview map\nByte address Description\n0000h Location zero within JEDEC JESD216B  SFDP space – start of SFDP header\n,,, Remainder of SFDP header followed by undefined space\n1000h Location zero within ID-CFI space – start of ID-CFI parameter tables\n...

Increments of the \nminor revision value indicate that previously reserved parameter fields may have been assigned a new definition or entire Dwords may have been added to the parameter table. However, the definition of previously existing fields is unchanged and therefore remain backward compatible with earlier SFDP parameter table revisions. Software can safely ignore increments of the minor revision number, as long as only those parameters the software was designed to support are used i.e. previously reserved fields and additional Dwords must be masked or ignored .
