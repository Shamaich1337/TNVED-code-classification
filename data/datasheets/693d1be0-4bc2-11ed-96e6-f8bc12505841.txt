Errors in output voltage versus temperature are only slope. Thus a calibration of the slope at one temperature corrects errors at all temperatures.\nThe circuit output (calibrated or not) is given by the equation:\nV\nOT + VOTO x   \nwhere T is the unknown temperature and To is the reference temperature (in °K).Nominally, the output is  calibrated at 10mV/°K.\nPrecautions should be taken to ensure good sensing accuracy. As in the case of all \ntemperatures sensors, self-heating can decrease accuracy. The LM135, LM235, and LM335 should operate with a low current but sufficient to drive the sensor and its calibration circuit \nto their maximum operating temperature.\nIf the sensor is used in surroundings where the thermal resistance is constant, the errors \ndue to self-heating can be externally calibrated. This is possible if the circuit is biased with a temperature stable curr ent. Heating will then be proportional to Zener voltage and therefore \ntemperature. In this way, the error due to self-heating is proportional to the absolute temperature as scale factor errors.\nTypical applications\n         T\nTo-------\nFigure 13.
