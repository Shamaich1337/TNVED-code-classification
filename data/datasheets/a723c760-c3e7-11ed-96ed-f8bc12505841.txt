Higher values and lower ESR will improve theoverall line transient response.\nOutput Decoupling (C2)\nThe NCP551 is a stable Regulator and does not require\nany specific Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) or aminimum output current. Capacitors exhibiting ESRs\nranging from a few m /C0087 up to 3.0 /C0087 can thus safely be used.\nThe minimum decoupling value is 0.1 /C0109F and can be\naugmented to fulfill stringent load transient requirements.The regulator accepts ceramic chip capacitors as well astantalum devices. Larger values improve noise rejection and\nload regulation transient response.\nEnable Operation\nThe enable pin will turn on or off the regulator. These\nlimits of threshold are covered in the electrical specification\nsection of this data sheet. If the enable is not used then thepin should be connected to V\nin.\nHints\nPlease be sure the V in and GND lines are suf ficiently wide.\nWhen the impedance of these lines is high, there is a chance\nto pick up noise or cause the regulator to malfunction.\nSet external components, especially the output capacitor,\nas close as possible to the circuit, and make leads as short aspossible.Thermal\nAs power across the NCP551 increases, it might become\nnecessary to provide some thermal relief. The maximumpower dissipation supported by the device is dependentupon board design and layout. Mounting pad configurationon the PCB, the board material, and also the ambient\ntemperature effect the rate of temperature rise for the part.\nThis is stating that when the NCP551 has good thermalconductivity through the PCB, the junction temperature will\nbe relatively low with high power dissipation applications.\nThe maximum dissipation the package can handle is\ngiven by:\nPD/C0043TJ(max) /C0042TA\nR/C0113JA\nIf junction temperature is not allowed above the\nmaximum 125 °C, then the NCP551 can dissipate up to\n400 mW @ 25 °C.\nThe power dissipated by the NCP551 can be calculated\nfrom the following equation:\nPtot/C0043/C0426Vin*Ignd(Iout)/C0427/C0041[Vin/C0042Vout]*Iout\nor\nVinMAX /C0043Ptot/C0041Vout*Iout\nIGND /C0041Iout\nIf a 150 mA output current is needed then the ground\ncurrent from the data sheet is 4.0 /C0109A. For an\nNCP551SN30T1 (3.0 V), the maximum input voltage willthen be 5.6 V .\nBattery or\nUnregulated\nVoltage\nFigure 20.

Current Boost Regulator Figure 22. Current Boost Regulator with\nShort Circuit Limit\nFigure 23. Delayed Turn −onFigure 24. Input Voltages Greater than 12 VThe NCP551 series can be current boosted with a PNP transist-\nor. Resistor R in conjunction with V BE of the PNP determines\nwhen the pass transistor begins conducting; this circuit is notshort circuit proof. Input/Output differential voltage minimum isincreased by V\nBE of the pass resistor.Short circuit current limit is essentially set by the V BE of Q2 and\nR1. I SC = ((V BEQ2  − ib * R2) / R1) + I O(max)  Regulator\nIf a delayed turn −on is needed during power up of several volt-\nages then the above schematic can be used. Resistor R, and\ncapacitor C, will delay the turn −on of the bottom regulator.A regulated output can be achieved with input voltages that\nexceed the 12 V maximum rating of the NCP551 series with\nthe addition of a simple pre −regulator circuit. Care must be\ntaken to prevent Q1 from overheating when the regulatedoutput (V\nout) is shorted to GND .Q1\nR\nNCP551, NCV551\nwww. onsemi.com\n11ORDERING INFORMATION\nDeviceNominal\nOutput Voltage Marking Package Shipping†\nNCP551SN15T1G1.5 LAOTSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP551SN18T1G1.8 LAPTSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP551SN25T1G2.5 LAQTSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP551SN27T1G2.7 LARTSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP551SN28T1G 2.8 LAS TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP551SN29T1G 2.9 LJL TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP551SN30T1G 3.0 LAT TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP551SN31T1G 3.1 LJM TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP551SN32T1G 3.2 LIV TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP551SN33T1G 3.3 LAU TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP551SN50T1G 5.0 LAV TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN14T1G* 1.4 AAT TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN15T1G* 1.5 LFZ TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN18T1G* 1.8 LGA TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN25T1G* 2.5 LGB TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN27T1G* 2.7 LGC TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN28T1G* 2.8 LGD TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN30T1G* 3.0 LGE TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN31T1G* 3.1 LJR TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN32T1G* 3.2 LFR TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN33T1G* 3.3 LGG TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN36T1G* 3.6 AEJ TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN38T1G* 3.8 AD5 TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV551SN50T1G* 5.0 LGF TSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNOTE: Additional voltages in 100 mV steps are available upon request by contacting your ON Semiconductor representative.\n†For information on tape and reel specifications, including part orientation and tape sizes, please refer to our Tape and Reel Packaging Specific-\nations Brochure, BRD8011/D.\n*NCV Prefix for Automotive and Other Applications Requiring Unique Site and Control Change Requirements; AEC −Q100 Qualified and PPAP\nCapable.\nTSOP−5\nCASE 483\nISSUE N\nDATE  12 AUG 2020\nSCALE 2:1\n15\nXXX M /C0071\n/C0071GENERIC\nMARKING DIAGRAM*15\n0.7\n0.0281.0\n0.039\n/C0466mm\ninches/C0467 SCALE 10:10.95\n0.037\n2.4\n0.0941.9\n0.074\n*For additional information on our Pb −Free strategy and soldering\ndetails, please download the ON Semiconductor Soldering and\nMounting Techniques Reference Manual, SOLDERRM/D.SOLDERING FOOTPRINT*\n*This information is generic.
