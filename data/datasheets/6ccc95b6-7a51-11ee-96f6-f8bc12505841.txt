The device cont rols the respective channel one or two by the two\nseparate input pins i.e. IN1 and IN2. When both inputs are low the device is in OFF condition. Each channel of the\ndevice is able to driv e loads up to 250mA. \nApplication range\nThe ITS42k5D-LD-F is capable of swit ching resistive, capacitive and induc tive loads (e.g. sensor units, LEDs,\nrelays, valves) in harsh industrial environments. An integrated freewheeling diode enables driving of inductive\nloads. The ITS42k5D-LD-F is suitable for switching small loads such as  sensors. For sensor supplies please refer\nto Infineon’s industrial linear voltage regulator products. \nThe qualification of this product is  based on JEDEC JESD47 and may refe rence existing qualification results of\nsimilar products.

In OFF state, the current consumption of the\ndevice is very low. For more details on current consum ption in ON and OFF states please refer to electrical\ncharacteristics. The logic input levels are compatible with 3.3V and 5V microcontrollers. To avoid switching noise\nall inputs have hyster esis. Logic level definitions are shown in Figure 3\nFigure 3 Function and Thresholds of the inputs IN1 and IN2\nThe input pins are optimized in terms of ESD protecti on, withstanding overvoltage scenarios like surge pulses.\nOvervoltage transient levels higher than th e maximum ratings of 45V must be avoided.\nNote: Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions  for extended periods may affect device reliability. \nIntegrated protection functions are desi gned to prevent IC destruction unde r fault conditions described in the \ndata sheet. Fault conditions are considered as “outside”  the normal operating range. Protection functions \nare neither designed for contin uous nor repetitive operation.\n4.2 Powerstage\nThe two outputs are designed as high-side switches with integrated freewheeling diodes from OUT to GND. The\nhigh side switch is a power P-cha nnel MOSFET. The integrated freewheelin g diodes enable the device to switch\ninductive loads on each channel.\nA built-in high accuracy current limi ter ensures that the Power P-channel MOSFET is protected against overload\nwhen driving heavy capacitive loads.\nFigure 4  shows the output voltage VOUT1 and VOUT2 controlled by the input interfaces IN1, IN2VINL\ntVIN\nVINH\nOFF OFF ONVINHY\nPowerstage\nData Sheet 7 Rev 1.0, 2015-04-28ITS42k5D-LD-F\nFunctional Description\nFigure 4 Input / output timings when switching a resistive load.\n4.3 Protection Functions\nNote: Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions  for extended periods may affect device reliability. \nIntegrated protection functions are desi gned to prevent IC destruction unde r fault conditions described in the \ndata sheet. Fault conditions are considered as “outside”  the normal operating range. Protection functions \nare neither designed for contin uous nor repetitive operation.\n4.3.1 Short Circuit Protection\nShort circuit is a special case of overload. The devi ce is protected within the supply voltage range from VS = 4.5\nV to 42 V.  If the device stays in shor t circuit condition for a lo nger time the in tegrated temperat ure protection will\nswitch the device OFF (both channels OFF). For details please look at chapter “O vertemperature Protection”.\n4.3.2 Protection by O vertemperature Shutdown\nThis circuit monitors the junction temperature Tj. When the device is ON, the junction temperature Tj increases\nproportional to the power loss. The temperature protector is equipped with two temperature sensors, one for each\none of the powerstages. When the thermal shutdown trip point TSDOFF is reached, the in-bu ilt protector switches\nOFF the respective channel. This over temperature shutdown is reported via di agnosis to the respective status flag\ni.e. either ST1 and ST2. The output remains OFF until the junction is cooled down to the thermal shutdown release\npoint TSDON. If the overload conditio n remains the device will toggle between both junction temperature values. It\nis not recommended for the device to stay in an overload condition  as this will degrade its lifetime.VOUTVIN\n10%90%tON tOFF\nSR ON=\n(dV/dt)ONtfVINH\nVINL\nt100%tr\nSR OFF =\n(dV/dt)OFFt\nData Sheet 8 Rev 1.0, 2015-04-28ITS42k5D-LD-F\nFunctional Description\n4.4 Diagnosis\nFor diagnostic purposes the device pr ovides two digital output pins ST1 and ST2 in order to indicate fault\nconditions.\nThe status flag ST1 indicates the status of channel 1 and flag ST2 in dicates the status of channel 2.\nEach status output (ST1, ST2) of the ITS42k 5D-LD-F is a high voltage open drain output.\nIn “normal” operation mode the NMOS open drain tran sistors are switched OFF.

is given as a hint for the implementation of the device only and shall not be \nregarded as a description or warranty of a certain functionality, condition or quality of the device.\nFigure 9 Application diagram ITS42k5D-LD-F\nThe ITS42k5D-LD-F can be connected via a reverse polarity diode to a supply network. It is recommended to place\na ceramic capacitor (e.g. CS = 220nF) between supply voltage VS and GND of the module to avoid line\ndisturbances. Wire harness inductors/resistors are sketched in the application circuit above.\nThe complex loads (resistive, capacitive or inductive) must be connected to the output pins OUT1 and OUT2.A built-in current limit protects the device against destruction.The ITS42k5D-LD-F can be switched on and off with standard  logic ground related logic signals at pin IN1 and IN2.\nIn standby mode (IN1=IN2=L) the ITS42k5D-LD-F is  deactivated with very low current consumption.\nThe output voltage slope is controlled during on and off transition to minimize emis sions. Only a small ceramic\ncapacitor COUT1,2 = 1nF is recommended to attenuate RF noise.\nAn evaluation board is available for the easy evaluation of the ITS42k5D-L D-F.

As a result, the PCB design must\nensure a thermal resistance of lower than 65K/W for the above mentioned application assumption. According to\n“Thermal Resistance” on Page 13 , at least a 300mm2 heatsink area is needed on a FR4 1s0p PCB or the FR4\n2s2p board with thermal vias coul d be used for this application.\nFor support regarding thermal considerations , please contact us via our support webpage\nwww.infineon.com\\support .\nFor further support, please refer to application notes on the Infineon website www.infineon.com .
