This standard device has proven ubiquity and versatility across a wide range of applications. This is due to\nit\'s low Iq and fast response.\nThe open-drain output allows the user to configure the output\'s logic low voltage (V OL) and can be utilized to\nenable the comparator to be used in AND functionality.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nIN+\nIN−OUT\nGNDR1Q1 Q3Q7 Q6VCC+\nQ2 Q4 Q5\nR2 R3Q8\nQ9\n7.3 Feature Description\nThe LMV331, LMV393 and LMV339 consists of a PNP input, whose Vbe creates a limit on the input common\nmode voltage capability, allowing LMV33x to accurately function from ground to V CC–Vbe(~700mV) differential\ninput. This enables much head room for modern day supplies of 3.3 V and 5.0 V.\nThe output consists of an open drain NPN (pull-down or low side) transistor. The output NPN will sink current\nwhen the positive input voltage is higher than the negative input voltage and the offset voltage. The V OL is\nresistive and will scale with the output current. Please see Figure 6-3  for V OL values with respect to the output\ncurrent.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Voltage Comparison\nThe LMV33x operates solely as a voltage comparator, comparing the differential voltage between the positive\nand negative pins and outputs a logic low or high impedance (logic high with pull-up) based on the input\ndifferential polarity.www.ti.comLMV331, LMV393, LMV339\nSLCS136U – AUGUST 1999 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: LMV331  LMV393  LMV339\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI\ndoes not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for determining\nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nLMV331, LMV393, and LMV339 will typically be used to compare a single signal to a reference or two signals\nagainst each other. Many users take advantage of the open drain output to drive the comparison logic output to\na logic voltage level to an MCU or logic device. The wide supply range and high voltage capability makes\nLMV331, LMV393, and LMV33 optimal for level shifting to a higher or lower voltage.\n8.2 Typical Application\n+\nLMV33xVLOGIC\nVSUP\nVrefVin +\nLMV33x\nVin-Vin+RpullupRpullupVLOGIC\nVSUP\nCL CL\nFigure 8-1.

If operating temperature is above or below 25°C the V ICR can range from 0 V to V CC– 0.7 V. This limits\nthe input voltage range to as high as V CC– 0.7 V and as low as 0 V. Operation outside of this range can yield\nincorrect comparisons.\nBelow is a possible list of input voltage situation and their outcomes:\n1. When both IN- and IN+ are both within the common mode range:\na. If IN- is higher than IN+ and the offset voltage, the output is low and the output transistor is sinking current\nb.If IN- is lower than IN+ and the offset voltage, the output is high impedance and the output transistor is not\nconducting\n2.When IN- is higher than common mode and IN+ is within common mode, the output is low and the output\ntransistor is sinking current\n3.When IN+ is higher than common mode and IN- is within common mode, the output is high impedance and\nthe output transistor is not conducting\n4.When IN- and IN+ are both higher than common mode, the output is low and the output transistor is sinking\ncurrent\n8.2.2.2 Minimum Overdrive Voltage\nOverdrive Voltage is the differential voltage produced between the positive and negative inputs of the\ncomparator over the offset voltage (V IO). In order to make an accurate comparison; the Overdrive Voltage (V OD)\nshould be higher than the input offset voltage (V IO). Overdrive voltage can also determine the response time of\nthe comparator, with the response time decreasing with increasing overdrive. Figure 8-2  show positive and\nnegative response times with respect to overdrive voltage.\n8.2.2.3 Output and Drive Current\nOutput current is determined by the pull-up resistance (Rpullup) and Vlogic voltage, refer to Figure 8-1 . The\noutput current will produce a output low voltage (V OL) from the comparator. In which V OL is proportional to the\noutput current. Use Figure 6-3  to determine V OL based on the output current.\nThe output current can also effect the transient response. More will be explained in the next section.\n8.2.2.4 Response Time\nThe transient response can be determined by the load capacitance (C L), load/pull-up resistance (R PULLUP ) and\nequivalent collector-emitter resistance (R CE).\n• The positive response time (τ p) is approximately τ P ~ R PULLUP  × C L\n• The negative response time (τ N) is approximately τ N ~ R CE × C L\n– R CE can be determine by taking the slope of Figure 6-3  in it\'s linear region at the desired temperature, or\nby dividing the V OL by I out\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nThe following curves were generated with 5 V on V CC and V Logic, RPULLUP  = 5.1 kΩ, and 50 pF scope probe.www.ti.comLMV331, LMV393, LMV339\nSLCS136U – AUGUST 1999 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: LMV331  LMV393  LMV339\nTime (uS)Voltage (V)\n0.2 0.22 0.24 0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.4-1-0.500.511.522.533.544.555.56\n5mV OD\n20mV OD\n100mV ODFigure 8-2. Response Time for Various Overdrives (Negative Transition)\n9 Power Supply Recommendations\nFor fast response and comparison applications with noisy or AC inputs, it is recommended to use a bypass\ncapacitor on the supply pin to reject any variation on the supply voltage. This variation cause temporary\nfluctuations in the comparator\'s input common mode range and create an inaccurate comparison.\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nFor accurate comparator applications without hysteresis it is important maintain a stable power supply with\nminimized noise and glitches, which can affect the high level input common mode voltage range. In order to\nachieve this, it is best to add a bypass capacitor between the supply voltage and ground. This should be\nimplemented on the positive power supply and negative supply (if available). If a negative supply is not being\nused, do not put a capacitor between the IC\'s GND pin and system ground.\n10.2 Layout Example\nOUT1 IN–\n2\nIN+ 3 4VCC 5\n0.1 FμGND0.1 FμGround\nBypass\nCapacitor\nPositive Supply\nNegative Supply or Ground\nGroundOnly needed\nfor dual power\nsupplies\nFigure 10-1.

Texas Instruments recommends that all integrated circuits be handled\nwith appropriate precautions. Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures can cause damage.\nESD damage can range from subtle performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision integrated circuits may\nbe more susceptible to damage because very small parametric changes could cause the device not to meet its published\nspecifications.\n11.4 Glossary\nTI Glossary This glossary lists and explains terms, acronyms, and definitions.\n12 Mechanical, Packaging, and Orderable Information\nThe following pages include mechanical, packaging, and orderable information.

Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation\nof the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.\n \n(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two\nlines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.\nAddendum-Page 2\nPACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM\nwww.ti.com 11-Apr-2023\n \nImportant Information and Disclaimer: The information provided on this page represents TI\'s knowledge and belief as of the date that it is provided.
