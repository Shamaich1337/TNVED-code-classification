For half -\nduplex operatio n, the transmitter outputs and receiver inputs \nshare the same transmission line. Transmitter Output Pin  Y \nlinks externally to Receiver Input Pin  A, and Transmitter \nOutput Pin Z links externally to Receiver Input Pin B.  \nDesigned for balanced transmission li nes, the ADM2484E  \ncomplies with ANSI TIA/EIA RS -485- A-1998 and ISO 8482: \n1987(E). The device employs Analog Devices , Inc., iCoupler ® \ntechnology to combine a 3 -channel isolator, a three -state \ndifferential line driver , and a differential input receiver into a \nsingle package.  The differential transmitter outputs and receiver inputs feature \nelectrostatic discharge circuitry that  provides protection up to \n±15 kV using the h uman body model (HBM). The  logic side of \nthe device can be powered with either a 5 V or a 3 .3 V supply , \nwhereas  the bus side requires  an isolated 3.3 V supply.  \nThe device has current -limiting and thermal shutdown features \nto protect against output short circuits and situations where bus \ncontention cause s excessive power dissipation.  \n \n \n \nADM2484E Data Sheet \n \nRev.

G | Page 12 of 16 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION  \nELECTRICAL ISOLATION  \nIn the ADM2484E , electrical isolation is implemented on the \nlogic side of the interface. Therefore, the part has two main \nsections: a digital isolation section and a transceiver section  \n(see Figure 25). The driver input signal , which is applied to the \nTxD  pin and referenced to the l ogic ground (GND 1), is coupled \nacross an isolation barrier to appear at the transceiver section \nreferenced to the isolated ground (GND 2). Similarly, the receiver  \ninput, which is referenced to the isolated ground in the transceive r \nsection, is coupled across the isolation barrier to appear at the \nRxD pin referenced to  the logic ground.  \niCoupler  Technology  \nThe digital signals transmit across the isolation barrier using \niCoupler technology. This technique uses chip scale transformer \nwindings to couple the digital signals magnetically from one side of the barrier to the other. Digital inputs are encoded into waveforms that are capable of exciting the primary transformer \nwinding. At the secondary winding, the induced waveforms are \ndecoded into the binary value that was originally transmitted.  \nPositive and negative  logic transitions at the input cause narrow \n(approximately 1 ns) p ulses to be sent to the decoder  via the \ntransformer. The decoder is bistable and is, therefore, set or reset \nby the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the absenc e of \nlogic transitions at the input  for more th an approximately 1 μs, \na periodic set of refresh pul ses, indicative of the correct input  \nstate, are sent to ensure dc correctnes s at the output. If the \ndecoder  receives  no internal pulses  for more than about 5  μs, \nthen the input side is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctio nal, \nin which cas e the output is forced to a default state (see Table 11). \nISOLATION\nBARRIERVDD2 VDD1\nA\nB\nGND2 GND1DE\nRxD\nREENCODEDECODE\nDECODEENCODE\nR\nTRANSCEIVER DIGITAL ISOL ATIONY\nZTxD DECODE ENCODE D\n06984-023\n \nFigure 25.

G | Page 13 of 16 THERMAL SHUTDOWN  \nThe ADM2484E  contains thermal  shutdown circuitry that \nprotects the part from excessive power dissipation during fault \nconditions. Shorting the driver outputs to a low impedance \nsource can result in  high driver currents. The thermal sensing \ncircuitry detects the increase in die temperature under this \ncondition and disa bles the driver outputs. This circuitry is \ndesigned to disable the driver outputs when a die temperature of 150°C is reached. As the device cools, the drivers re -enable at \na temperature of 140°C.  \nTRUE FAIL -SAFE RECEIVER INPUTS  \nThe receiver inputs have a true fail -safe feature ensur ing that \nthe receiver output is high when the inputs are open or shorted. During line -idle condition s, when no driver on the bus is enabled, \nthe voltage across a terminating resistor at the receiver input decays  \nt o  0  V.  Wi t h  t r a ditional transceivers, receiver input thresholds \nspecified between −200 mV and +200 mV mean that external \nbias resistors are required on the A and B pins to ensure that the \nreceiver outputs are in a known state. The true fail -safe receiver \ninput feature el iminates the need for bias resistors by specifying \nthe receiver input threshold between −3 0 mV and −200 mV . \nThe guaranteed negative threshold means  that when the voltage \nbetween A and B decays to 0  V; the receiver output is guaran -\nteed to be high.  \nMAGNETIC  FIELD IMMUNITY  \nThe limitation on the magnetic field immunity of the i Coupler  \nis set by the c ondition in which an induced voltage in the receiving  \ncoil of the transformer  is large enough to either falsely set or reset \nthe decoder. The following analysis defines the conditions under  \nwhich this may occur. The 3  V operating condition of the \nADM2484E  is examined because it represents the most \nsusceptible mode of operation.  \nThe pulses at the transfo rmer output have an amplitude greater \nthen 1  V. The decoder has a sensing threshold of about 0.5  V, \nthus establishing a 0.5  V margin in which indu ced voltages can \nbe tolerated.  \nThe voltage induced across the receiving coil is given by  \n∑π\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8ebβ−=2\nnrdtdV ; N n ,...,2,1=  \nwhere : \nβ is the magnetic flux density (gauss).  \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil.  \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm).  \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil and an imposed \nrequirement that the induced voltage is, at most, 50% of the \n0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable magnetic \nfield can be determined using Figure 26.

Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density  \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum allowable magnetic field of 0. 2 kgauss in duces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the \nsensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. Similarly, if such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse and is the worst -case polarity, it reduces the recei ved pulse fro m \n>1.0 V to 0.75 V , still well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold of \nthe decoder.  \nFigure 27 shows the magnetic flux density values in terms of \nmore familiar quantities , such as maximum allowable current \nflow at given distances away from the ADM2484E  transformers.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)1k 10k 100k 100M 1M 10MDISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 100mmDISTANCE = 5mm1000\n100\n0.1110\n0.01MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)\n06984-025\n \nFigure 27.

G | Page 14 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nISOLATED POWER  SUPPLY CIRCUIT  \nThe ADM2484E  requires isolated power capable of 3.3  V at up \nto approximately 75 mA (this current is dependent  on the data \nrate and termination resistors used) to be supplied between the \nVDD2 and the GND 2 pins. A transformer  driver circuit with a \ncenter  tapped transformer and LDO can be used to generate the \nisolated 5  V supply , as shown in Figure 28. The center  tapped \ntransformer provides electrical isolation of the 5 V power \nsupply. The primary  winding of the transformer is excited with \na pair of square waveforms that are 180° out of phase with each \nother. A pair of Schottky diodes and a smoothing capacitor are \nused to create a rectified signal from the secondary winding. \nThe ADP3330 linear v oltage regulator provide s a regulated \npower supply to the bus -side circuitry (V DD2) of the ADM2484E . \n+IN OUT\nSD\nERR\nNR\nGNDADP3330VCC\nVCC\nVCC+3.3V\n10µF22µF\nADM2484EVDD1 VDD2\nGND 1GND 2SD103C\nSD103C78253ISOLATION\nBARRIER\nTRANSFORMER\nDRIVER\n06984-026 \nFigure 28. Isolated Power Supply  Circuit  PC BOARD LAYOUT  \nThe ADM2484E  isolated RS -485 transceiver requires no external  \ninterface circuitry for the logic interfaces. Power supply bypassing  \nis required  at the input and output supply pins ( see Figure 29). \nBypass capacitors are conveniently connected  between Pin  1 \nand Pin 2 for V DD1 and between Pin  15 and Pin 16 for V DD2.  \nBest practice suggests the following:  \n• A capacitor value between 0.01 µF and 0.1 µF.  \n• A total lead length between both ends of the capacitor and \nthe input power supply  pin that does not exce ed 20 mm.  \n• Unless the ground pair on each package side is connected \nclose to the package , consider bypassing between Pin  1 and \nPin 8 and between Pin 9 and Pin 16. \nVDD1\nGND 1\nRxD\nRE\nDE\nTxD\nNC\nGND 1VDD2\nGND 2\nA\nB\nZ\nY\nNC\nGND 2\nNC = NO CONNECTADM2484E\n06984-027 \nFigure 29. Recommended PCB  Layout  \nIn applications involving high common -mode transients, ensure \nthat board coupling across the isolation  barrier is minimized. \nFurthe rmore, design the board layout so that any coupling that \ndoes occur equally affects all pins on a given component side. Failure to ensure this could cause voltage differentials  between pins \nexceeding the absolute maximum ratings  of the device , thereby \nleading to latch -up or permanent damage.  \nData Sheet ADM2484E \n \nRev.

Up to 256 transceivers can be connected to the \nRS-485 bus. To minimize reflections, the line must be terminated  at the receiving end in its characteristic impedance, and stub \nlengths off the main line must be kept as short as possible. For \nhalf-duplex operation, this means that both ends of the line must be \nterminated, because either end can be t he receiving end . \n \nNOTES\n1.
