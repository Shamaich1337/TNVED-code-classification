Current loop compliance voltage is 0 V to AV DD − 2.5 V .  \nThe flexibl e serial interface is SPI - and MICROWIRE ™-compatible  \nand can be operated in 3 -wire mode to minimize the digital \nisolation req uired in isolated applications.  \nThe device also includes a power -on-reset function , ensuring \nthat th e device powers up in a known state. The part also includes \nan asynchronous clear pin (CLEAR) that sets the outputs to \nzero -scale/mid scale voltage output or the low end  of the \nselected current range.  \nThe total output error is typically ± 0.01% in current mode and \n±0.01% in voltage mode.  \nTable 1.

O | Page 27 of 44 TERMINOLOGY  \nRelative Accuracy or Integral  Nonlinearity (INL)  \nFor the DAC, relative accuracy, or INL, is a measure of the \nmaximum deviation, in LSBs, from a straight line passing \nthrough the endpoints of the DAC transfer function. A typical INL vs. code plot can be seen in Fi gure 17. \nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL)  \nDNL is the difference between the measured change and the \nideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes. A specified \ndifferential nonlinearity o f ±1 LSB maximum ensures monoton -\nicity. This DAC is guaranteed monotonic by design. A typical DNL vs. code plot can be seen in Figure 19. \nMonotonicity  \nA DAC is monotonic if the output either increases or remains constan t for increasing digital input code. The AD5 412/AD5 422 \nare monotonic over their full operating temperature range.  \nBipolar Zero Error  \nBipolar zero error is the deviation of the analog output from the \nideal half -scale output of 0 V when the DAC register is loaded \nwith 0x8000 (straight binary coding) or 0x0000 ( twos complement \ncoding). A plot of bipolar zero error vs. temperature can be seen \nin Figure 28. \nBipolar Zero Temperature Coefficient ( TC) \nBipolar zero TC is a measure  of the change in the bipolar zero \nerror with a change in temperature. It is expressed in ppm FSR/°C.  \nFull -Scale Error  \nFull-scale error is a measure of the output error when full -scale \ncode is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally, the output should be \nfull-scale − 1 LSB. Full- scale error is expressed in percent of \nfull-scale range (% FSR).  \nNegative Full -Scale Error/Zero -Scale Error  \nNegative full -scale error is the error in the DAC output voltage \nwhen 0x0000 (straight binary coding) or 0x8000 (twos complement  \ncoding) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally, the output voltage should be negative full -scale  − 1 LSB. A plot of zero -scale error \nvs. temperature can be seen in Figure 30. \nZero -Scale Temperature Coefficient (TC)  \nZero -scale TC  is a measure of the change in zero -scale error \nwith a change  in temperature. Zero -scale error TC is expressed \nin ppm FSR/°C.  \nOutput Voltage Settling Time  \nOutput voltage settling time is the amount of time it takes for th e \noutput to settle to a specified level  for a full -scale input change.  \nSlew Rate  \nThe slew rate of a device is a limitation in the rate of change of the outpu t voltage. The output slewing speed of a voltage -output  \nDAC is usuall y limited by the slew rate of the amplifier used at \nits output. Slew rate is measured from 10% to 90% of the output signal and is expressed  in V/µs.  \n Gain Error  \nGain error is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the \ndeviation in slope of the DAC t ransfer characteristic from the \nideal expressed in % FSR. A plot of gain error vs. temperature can be seen in Figure 29. \nGain Error Temperature Coefficient ( TC) \nGain error TC  is a measure of the change in gain error with \nchanges in temperature. Gain e rror TC is expressed in ppm \nFSR/°C.  \nTotal Unadjusted Error  (TUE)  \nTUE  is a measure of the output error taking all the various \nerrors into account, namely INL error, offset error, gain error, and output drift over supplies, temperature, and time. TUE is expressed in % FSR.  \nCurrent Loop Voltage Compliance  \nThe maximum voltage at the I\nOUT pin for which the output \ncurrent  is equal to the programmed value.  \nPower -On Glitch Energy  \nPower -on glitch energy is the impulse injected into the analog \noutput wh en the AD5412/ AD5422 is powered on.  It is specified \nas the area of the glitch in nV -sec. See Figure 43 and Figure 60. \nDigital -to-Analog Glitch Impulse  \nDigital -to-analog glitch impulse is the impulse injected into the \nanalog output when the input code in the DAC register changes state, but the output voltage remains constant. It is normally specified as the area of the glitch in nV -sec and is measured \nwhen the digital input code is changed by 1 LSB at the major carry transition (0x7FFF to 0x8000). See Figure 40 and \nFigur e 63. \nGlitch Impulse Peak Amplitude  \nGlitch impulse peak amplitude  is the peak amplitude of the \nimpulse injected into the analog output when the input code in the DAC register changes state. It is specified as the amplitude \nof the glitch in mil livolt  and is measured when the digital input \ncode is changed by 1 LSB at the major carry transition (0x7FFF \nto 0x8000). See Figure 40 and Figur e 63. \nDigital Feedthrough  \nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into \nthe analog output of the DAC from the digital inputs of the DAC but is measured when the DAC output is not updated. It is specified in nV -sec and measured with a full -scale code change \non the data bus.  \n \n  \n \n \n \nAD5412/AD5422  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

The reference TC \nis calculated using the box method, which defines the TC as the \nmaximum change in the reference output over a given temperature \nrange  expressed i n ppm/°C , as follows:  \n610×\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\uf8ee\n×−=TempRange VV VTC\nREFnomREFmin REFmax where : \nVREFmax  is the maximum reference output measured over the \ntotal temperature range.  \nVREFmin  is the minimum reference output measured over the total \ntemperature range.  \nVREFnom  is the nominal reference output voltage, 5  V. \nTempRange  is the specified temperature rang e, −40°C to \n+105°C.  \nLoad Regulation  \nLoad regulation  is the change in reference output voltage due to \na specified change in load current. It is expressed in ppm/mA.  \n \n \nData Sheet  AD5412/AD5422  \n \nRev. O | Page 29 of 44 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD5412/ AD5422 are precision digital -to-current loop and \nvoltage output converter s designed to meet the requirements of \nindustria l process control applications. They  provide a high \nprecision, fully integrated, low cost single -chip solution for \ngenerating current loop and unipolar/bipolar voltage outputs. \nCurrent ranges are  0 mA to 20  mA, 0  mA to 24  mA, and 4 mA \nto 20  mA; the voltage  ranges available are 0 V to 5 V,  ± 5  V,  0  V \nto 10  V, and ±10  V; a 10% overrange is available on all voltage \noutput ranges. The current and voltage outputs are available on separate pins , and only one is active at any time. The desired \noutput configuration is user selectable via the control register.  \nARCHITECTURE  \nThe DAC core architecture of the AD5412/ AD5422 consists \nof two matched DAC sections. A simplified circuit diagram is \nshown in Figure 65. The four  MSBs of the 12 -/16-bit data -word \nare d ecoded to drive 15 switches, E1 to E15. E ach of these switc hes \nconnects one  of 15 matched resistors to either ground or the \nreference buffer output. The remaining 8 /12 bits of the data -\nword drive the S0 to S7/S11 switches of an 8-/12-bit voltage \nmode R -2R ladder network.  \n8-12 BIT R-2R LADDER FOUR MSBs DECODED IN TO\n15 EQUA L SEGMENTS2R 2R\nS0 S1 S7/S 11 E1 E2 E15VOUT\n2R 2R 2R 2R 2R\n06996-057 \nFigure 65.

Voltage Output \nVoltage Output Amplifier  \nThe voltage output amplifier is capable of generating both unipolar \nand bipolar output voltages. It is capable of driving a load of 1 kΩ in parallel with 1 µF (with an external compensation \ncapacitor ) to GND. The source and sink capabilities of the \noutput amplifier can be seen in Figure 37. The slew rate is \n1 V/µs with a fu ll-scale settling time of  25 µs maximum (10 V \nstep). Figure  67 shows the voltage output driving a load, R\nLOAD, \non top of a common -mode voltage (V CM) of − 1 V to +3  V.  I n  \noutput module applications where a ca ble could possibly \nbecome disconnected from +V SENSE, resulting in the amplifier \nloop being broken and possibly resulting in large destructive voltages on V\nOUT, include an optional  resistor  (R1) between \n+V SENSE and V OUT, as shown in Fi gure  67, of a value between  \n2 kΩ and 5 kΩ to ensure the amplifier loop is kept closed. If \nremote sensing of the load is not required, connect +V SENSE \ndirectly to V OUT and connect −VSENSE directly to GND. When \nchanging ranges on the voltage output , a glitch  may occur.  For \nthis reason , it is recommended that the output be  disabled b y \nsetting the OUTEN bit of the c ontrol register to logic low before \nchanging the output voltage range;  this prevent s a glit ch from \noccur ring. \nDriving Large Capacitive Loads  \nThe voltage output amplifier is capable of driving capacitive \nloads of up to 1  µF with the addition of a non polarized  4 nF \ncompensation capacitor between the C COMP and V OUT pins. \nWithout the compensation capacitor, up to 20  nF capacitive \nloads can be driven.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAD5412/AD5422  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. O | Page 30 of 44 SERIAL INTERFACE  \nThe AD5412/ AD5422 are controlled over a versatile 3 -wire \nserial interface that operates at clock rates of up to 30 MHz. It is \ncompatible with SPI, QSPI ™, MICROWIRE , and DSP standards.  \nInput Shift Register  \nThe input shift register is 24 bits wide. Data is loaded into the \ndevice MSB first as a 24 -bit word under the control of a serial \nclock i nput, SCLK. Data is clocked in on the rising edge of SCLK. \nThe input register consists of eight  address bits  and 16 data bits , \nas shown i n Table 8. The 24 -bit word is unconditionally latched \non the rising edge of the LATCH  pin. Data continue s to be clocked \nin irr espective of the state of LATCH.  On the rising edge of \nLATCH , the data that is present in the input register is  latched ; \nin other words , the last 24 bits to be clocked in before the rising \nedge of LATCH is the data that is latched. The timing diagram for this operation is shown in Figure  2. \nTable 8. Input Shift Register Format  \nMSB    LSB \nD23  to D16  D15  to D0 \nAddress byte  Data -word \nTable 9.

A continuous SCLK source can be u sed \nonly if LATCH is taken high after the correct number of data \nbits have been clocked in. In gated clock mode, a burst clock containing the exact number of clock cycles must be used, and \nLATCH must be taken high after the final clock to latch the \ndata. T he rising edge of SCLK that clocks in the MSB of the \ndata-word mark s the beginning of  the write cycle. Exactly 24 \nrising clock edges must be applied to SCLK before LATCH is brought high. If LATCH is brought high before the 24\nth rising \nSCLK edge, the data w ritten is invalid. If more than 24 rising \nSCLK edges are applied before LATCH is brought high, the \ninput data is also invalid.  \n CONTROLLER\nDATA INDATA OUT\nSERIA L CLOCK\nCONTRO L OUTAD5412/\nAD54221\nSDOSDIN\nSCLK\nLATCH\nAD5412/\nAD54221\nSDOSDIN\nSCLK\nLATCH\nAD5412/\nAD54221\nSDOSDIN\nSCLK\nLATCH\n1ADDITIONA L PINS OMITTED FOR CLARIT Y.\n06996-060 \nFigure 68. Daisy Chaining the AD5412/ AD5422  \nDaisy -Chain Operation  \nFor systems that contain several devices, t he SDO pin can be \nused to daisy -chain the devices together as shown in Figure 68. \nThis daisy -chain mode can be useful in system diagnostics and \nin reducing the number of serial interface lines. Daisy -chain \nmode is enabled by setting the DCEN bit of the control register  \nto 1. The first rising edge of SCLK that clocks in the MSB of the \ndata-word marks the beginning of the write cycle. SCLK is \ncontinuously applied to the input shift register. If more than 24 clock pulses are applied, the data ripples out of the shift \nregister and a ppears on the SDO line. This data is valid on the \nrising edge of SCLK, having been clocked out on the previous \nfalling SCLK edge. By connecting the SDO of the first device to the SDIN input of the next device in the chain, a multidevice interface is constr ucted. Each device in the system requires \n24 clock pulses. Therefore, the total number of clock cycles \nmust equal 24 × n , where n  is the total number of AD5412/  \nAD5422 devices in the chain. When the serial transfer to all \ndevices is complete, LATCH is taken high. This latches the input data in each device in the daisy chain. The serial clock can be a continuous or a gated clock.  \nA continuous SCLK source can be used  only  if LATCH is taken \nhigh after the correct number of clock cycles. In gated clock mode, a burst clock containing the exact number of clock cycles \nmust be used, and LATCH must be taken high after the final \nclock to l atch the data (s ee Figure 4 for a timing diagram).  \nData Sheet  AD5412/AD5422  \n \nRev. O | Page 31 of 44 Readback Operation  \nReadback mode is invoked by setting the address byte  and read \naddress when writing to the input r egister  (see Table 10 and \nTable  12). The next write to the AD5412/ AD5422 should be a \nNOP command, which  clock s out the data from the previously \naddressed register as shown in Figure 3. \nBy default the SDO pin is disabled  after having addressed the \nAD5 412/ AD5422 for a read operation;  a rising edge on LATCH \nenable s the SDO pin in anticipa tion of data being clocked out. \nAfter the data has been clocked out on SDO, a rising edge on \nLATCH disable s (tristate) the SDO pin . To read back the  data \nregister, for example, implement the following sequence : \n1. Write 0x020001 to the input register. This configures the \npart for read mode with the data register selected.  \n2. Follow this with a second write : a NOP condition, which is  \n0x000000.  During this write, the data from the register is \nclocked out on the SDO line.  \nTable 10. Read Address Decoding  \nRead Address  Function  \n00 Read status register  \n01 Read data register  \n10 Read control register  \nPOWER -ON S TATE  \nDuring power -on of the  AD5412/ AD5422, the power -on-reset \ncircuit ensures that all registers are loaded with zero -code. As \nsuch, both outputs are disabled; that is, the V OUT and I OUT pins \nare in tristate. The +V SENSE pin is internally  connected to ground \nthrough a 3 0 kΩ resistor. Therefore, if the V OUT and +V SENSE pins \nare connected together, V OUT is effectively clamped to ground \nthrough  a 30 kΩ resistor. Also upon power- on, internal calibra tion \nregisters are read, and the data is applied to internal calibration circuitry. For a reliable read operation, there must be sufficient voltage on the AV\nDD supply when the read event is triggered b y \nthe DV CC power supply powering up. Powering up the DV CC \nsupply after the AV DD supply has reached at least 5  V ensures this. If \nDV CC and AV DD are powered up simultaneously , then the \nsupplies should be powered up at a rate greater than, typically, \n5000 V/sec. If the internal DV CC is enabled, the supplies should \nbe powered up at a rate greater than, typically, 2000 V/sec. If \nthis cannot  be achieved, issue a reset command to th e AD5412/  \nAD5422 after power -on; this performs a power -on-reset event, \nreading the calibration registers and ensures specified  operation \nof the AD5412/ AD5422. To ensure correct calibration and to \nallow the internal reference to settle to its correct tr im value, \n40 µs should be allowed after a successful power on reset.

O | Page 35 of 44 AD5412/ AD5422 FEATURES  \nFAULT  ALERT  \nThe AD5412/ AD5422 are equipped with a FAULT  pin, which \nis an open -drain output allowing several AD5412/ AD5422 \ndevices to be connected together to one pull -up resistor for \nglobal fault detection. The FAULT  pin is forced active by one  of \nthe following fault scenarios:  \n• The v oltage at I OUT attempt s to rise above the compliance \nrange, due to an open -loop circuit or insufficient power \nsupply voltage. The I OUT current is controlled by a PMOS \ntransistor and internal amplifier , as shown in Figure 66. \nThe internal circuitry that develops the fault output avoids \nusing a comparator with window limits  because  this would \nrequire an actual output error before the FAULT  output  \nbecomes active. Instead, the signal is generated when the \ninternal amplifier in the output stage has less than ~1 V  \nof remaining drive capability (when the gate of the output \nPMOS transistor nearly reaches ground). Thus, the FAULT  \noutput  activates slightly before the compliance limit is \nreached. Because  the comparison is made within the \nfeedback loop of the output amplifier, the output accuracy \nis maintained by its open -loop gain , and an output error \ndoes not occur before the FAULT  output becomes active.  \n• If the core temperature of the AD5412/ AD5422 exceeds  \napproximately 150°C.  \nThe I OUT fault and over temp  bits of the status register are used \nin conjunction with the FAULT  pin to inform the user which \none of the fault conditions cause d the FAULT  pin to be asserted \n(see Table 20 and Table 21). \nVOLTAGE OUTPUT SHORT CIRCUIT PROTECTION  \nUnder normal operation , the voltage output sink s/source s \n10 mA. The maximum current that the voltage output deliver s \nis ~20 mA; this is the short -circuit current.  \nVOLTAGE OUTPUT OVER RANGE  \nAn ov errange facility is provided on the voltage output. When \nenabled via the control register, the selected output  range is \noverranged by , typically , 10%.  \nVOLTAGE OUTPUT FORCE -SENSE  \nThe +V SENSE and − VSENSE pins are provided to facilitate remote \nsensing of the load connected to the voltage output. If the load is connected  at the end of a long or high impedance cable, \nsensing the voltage at the load allow s the output amplifier to \ncompensate and ensure that the correct voltage is applied across \nthe load. This function is limited only by the available power \nsupply headroom.  \n \n  ASYNCHRONOUS CLEAR ( CLEAR)  \nThe CLEAR pin is an active high clear that allows the voltage \noutput to be cleared to either zero- scale code or midscale code, \nuser selectable via the CLEAR SELECT pin , or the CLRSEL bit \nof the control register , as described in Table 22. (The clear select \nfeature is a logical OR function of the CLEAR SELECT pin and \nthe CLRSEL bit .) The c urrent output clear s to the bottom of i ts \nprogrammed range.  It is necessary for CLEAR to be high for a \nminimum amount of time to complete the operation  (see Figure  2). \nWhen the CLEAR signal is returned low, the output remains at \nthe cleared value.  The preclear value can be restored by pulsing \nthe LATCH signal low without clocking any data. A new value cann ot be programmed until the CLEAR pin is returned low.  \nTable 22. CLRSEL  Options  \nCLRSEL  Output Value  \nUnipolar Output Range  Bipolar Output Range  \n0 0 V 0 V \n1 Mid scale  Zero  scale \nIn addition to defining the output value for a clear operation, \nthe CLRSEL bit and CLEAR SELECT pin also define the default \noutput value. During  selec tion of a new voltage range , the \noutput value is  as defined in Table 22. To avoid glitches on the \noutput , it is recommended that, before changing voltage ranges, \nthe user disable the output by setting the OUTEN bit of the control register to logic low. When OUTEN  is set to logic high, \nthe output go es to the default value as defined by CLRSEL and \nCLEAR SELECT.  \nINTERNAL REFERENCE \nThe AD5412/ AD5422 contain an integrated 5  V voltage \nreference with initial accuracy of ±5  mV max imum  and a \ntemperature drift coefficient of ±10 ppm/°C max imum . The \nreference voltage is buffered and externally available for use elsewhere within the system. See Figure 16 for a load regulation \ngraph of the integrated reference.  \nEXTERNAL CURRENT SETTING R ESISTOR  \nRSET is an internal sense resistor as part of the voltage- to-current \nconversion circuitry  (see Figure 66). The stability of the output \ncurrent over temperature is dependent on the stability of the value of R\nSET. As a method of improving  the stability of the \noutput current over temperature , an external precision 15  kΩ \nlow drift resistor can be connected to the R SET pin of the \nAD5412/ AD5422 to be used instead of the internal resistor \n(RSET). The external resistor is selected via the control register \n(see Table  15). \n \n \n \n \nAD5412/AD5422  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. O | Page 36 of 44 DIGITAL POWER SUPPLY  \nBy default, the DV CC pin accepts a power supply of 2.7  V to \n5.5 V. Alternatively, via the DV CC SELECT pin , an internal 4.5  V \npower supply can be output on the DV CC pin for use as a digital \npower supply for other devices in the system or as a termination \nfor pull -up resistors. This facility offers the advantage of not \nhaving to bring a digital supply across an isolation barrier. The internal power supply is enabled by  leaving the DV\nCC SELECT \npin unconnected. To disable the internal supply , tie DV CC \nSELECT to 0  V.  DV CC is capable of supplying up to 5  mA of \ncurrent  (for a load regulation graph , see Figure 10). \nEXTERNAL BOOST FUNCTION  \nThe addition of an external boost transistor , as shown in \nFigure  70, reduce s the power dissipated in the AD5412/ AD5422 \nby reducin g the current flowing in the on -chip output transistor \n(dividin g it by the current gain of the external circuit). A discrete  \nNPN transistor with a breakdown voltage, BV CEO, greater than \n40 V can be used.  The external boost capability has been developed \nfor users who may wish to use the AD5412/ AD5422 at the \nextremes of the supply voltage, load current , and temperature \nrange. The b oost transistor can also be used to r educe the \namount of  temperature -induced drif t in the part. This minimize s \nthe temp erature -induced drift of the on -chip voltage reference, \nwhich improves on drift and linearity.  \nBOOSTMJD31C\nORPBSS8 110Z\nR\nLOAD 0.022µF1kΩAD5412/AD5422\nIOUT\n06996-061 \nFigure 70. External Boost Configuration  \nEXTERNAL COMPENSATION CAPACITOR  \nThe voltage output can ordinarily drive capacitive loads of up to 20 nF; if there is a requirement to drive greater capacitive loads, \nof up to 1  µF, an external compensation capacitor can be con -\nnected between the C\nCOMP and V OUT pins. The addition  of the \ncapacitor keeps the output voltage stable but also reduce s the \nbandwidth and increase s the settling time of the voltage output.  \nHART COMMUNICATION  \nThe AD5412/ AD5422 (LFCSP version only) contain a CAP2 \npin, into which a HART signal can be coupled. The HART signal appears on the current ou tput if the output is enabled. To \nachieve a 1 mA peak -to-peak current, the signal amplitude at \nthe CAP2 pin must be 48 mV peak -to-peak. Assuming that the \nmodem output amplitude is 500 mV peak -to-peak, its output \nmust be attenuated by 500/48 = 10.42. If this voltage is used, the \ncurrent output should meet the HART amplitude specifications. \nFigure  71 shows the recommended circuit for attenuating and \ncoupling in the HART signal.  HART MODEM\nOUTPUTC1C2\nCAP2AVDD\n06996-051 \nFigure 71. Coupling HART Signal \nIn determining the absolute values of the capacitors, ensure that \nthe FSK output from the modem is passed undistorted. Thus, the bandwidth presented to the modem output signal must pass 1200 Hz and 2200 Hz frequencies. Th e recommended values \nare C1 = 2.2 nF and C2 = 22  nF. Digitally controlling the slew \nrate of the output is necessary to meet the analog rate of change requirements for HART.  \nDIGITAL SLEW RATE CONTROL  \nThe slew rate c ontrol feature of the AD5412/ AD5422 allows the \nuser to control the rate at which the output v oltage or current  \nchanges. With the slew rate control feature disabled , the output \nchange s at a rate limited by the output drive circuitry and the \nattached load. See Figure 64 for current output step and \nFigur e 38 for voltage output step. To reduce the slew rate, enable \nthe sl ew rate control feature. With the feature enabled via the \nSREN bit of the control register (see Table  15), the output,  instead \nof slewing directly between two values,  steps digitally at a rate \ndefined by two parameters accessible via the control register, as shown in Table  15. The parameters are set by the SR clock and \nSR step  bits. SR clock defines the rate at which the digital slew is \nupdated;  SR step defines by how much the output value changes \nat each update. Both parameters together define the rate of change of the output voltage or current. Table 23 and Table  24 \noutline the range of values for both the SR clock and SR step \nparameters. Figure 72 shows the output current changing for \nramp times of 10 ms, 50 ms, and 100 ms.  \nTable 23.

The output can be halted at its c urrent \nvalue with a write to the control register. To avoid halting the output slew, the slew active bit (see Table 20) can be read  to \ncheck that the slew has completed before writing to any of the AD5410/ AD5420 registers. The update clock frequency for any  \ngiven value is the same for all output ranges. The step size, \nhowever, varies across output ranges for a given value of step \nsize because the LSB size is different for each output range. \nTable 25 shows the range of programmable slew times for a full-\nscale change on any of the output ranges. The values in Table 25 \nwere obtained usi ng Equation 1.  \nThe digital slew rate control feature results in a staircase \nformation on the current output, as shown in Figure 76. This \nfigure  also shows how the sta ircase can be removed by \nconnecting capacitors to the CAP1 and CAP2 pins, as described \nin the I\nOUT Filtering Capacitors (LFCSP Package)  section.  \n 0510152025\n–10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110OUTPUT CURRENT (mA)\nTIME (ms)TA = 25°C\nAVDD = 24V\nRLOAD  = 300Ω\n06996-13910ms RAMP, SR CLOCK = 0x1, SR STEP = 0x5\n50ms RAMP, SR CLOCK = 0xA, SR STEP = 0x7\n100ms RAMP, SR CLOCK = 0x8, SR STEP = 0x5\n \nFigure 72.

Figure 75 shows the effect \nthe capacitors have on the slew rate of the output current. To \nachieve significant reductions in the rate of change, very large capacitor values are required, which may not be suitable in some applications. I n this case, the digital slew rate control \nfeature can be used. The capacitors can be used in conjunction \nwith the digital slew rate control fe ature  as a means of \nsmoothing out the steps caused by the digital code increments , \nas shown in Figure 76. \nAD5412/AD5422  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

In current mode, \nthe V OUT pin is high impedance ; whereas  in voltage output \nmode, the I OUT pin is high impedance and does  not affect the \nvoltage output.  It is important that the extern al R SET be used in \nthis configura tion, as depicted in Figure 77. \nIOUTAD5412/\nAD5422\nIOUT/VOUT+VSENSE\n–VSENSEVOUT\nRSETOP07/OP184\n06996-071 \nFigure 77.

This ensure s stability \nwith loads above  50 mH. There is no maximum capacitance \nlimit. The capacitive component of the load may cause slower \nsettling. The digital slew rate c ontrol feature may also prove \nuseful in this situation.  \nTRANSIENT VOLTAGE PROTECTION  \nThe AD5412/ AD5422 contain  ESD p rotection diodes that \nprevent damage from normal handling. The industrial control environment can, however, subject I/O circuit s to much higher \ntransients. T o protect the AD5412/ AD5422 from excessively \nhigh voltage transients, external power diodes and a surge \ncurrent limiting resistor are  required, as shown in Figure 78. \nThe constraint on the resistor value is that , during normal \noperation , the output level at I\nOUT must remain within its voltage \ncomplianc e limit of AV DD – 2.5 V, and the two  protection diodes \nand resistor must have appropriate power ratings. Further \nprotection can be provided with transient voltage su ppressors or \ntransorbs;  these are available as both unidirectional suppressors \n(protect against positive high voltage transient s) and bidirectional  \nsuppressors (protect  against both positive and negative high \nvoltage transients) and are available in a wide range of standoff and breakdown voltage ratings. It is recommended that all field connected nodes be protected.  AVDD\nIOUT\nRLOADRPAVDD\nAD5412/\nAD5422\nGND AVSS\nAVSS\n06996-064\n \nFigure 78.

The contents of the registers can be read using \nthe readback function.  \n \nAD5412/AD5422  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. O | Page 40 of 44 LAYOUT GUIDELINES  \nIn any circuit where accuracy is important, careful consideration  of \nthe power supply and ground return layout helps to  ensure the \nrated performance. Design t he printed circuit board (PCB) on \nwhich the AD5412/ AD5422 is mounted so that the analog and \ndigital sections are separated and  confined to certain areas of the \nboard. If the AD5412/ AD5422 is in a system where multiple \ndevices require an analog ground -to-digital ground connection,  \nmake  the connection at one point only. Establish the star ground  \npoint as close as possible to the device.  \nThe AD5412/ AD5422 should have ample supply bypassing of  \n10 µF in parallel with 0.1 µF on each supply located as close to \nthe package as possible, ideally right up against the device. The \n10 µF capacitors are the tantalum bead type. The 0.1 µ F capacitor  \nshould have low effective series resistance (ESR) and low effective  \nseries inductance (ESI) , such as the common ceramic types, \nwhich provide a low impedance path to ground at high frequencies to handle trans ient currents d ue to internal logic switching.  \nThe power supply lines of the AD5412/ AD5422 should use as \nlarge a trace as poss ible to provide low impedance paths and reduce  \nthe effects of glitches on the po wer supply line. F ast switching \nsignals such as clocks should be shielded with a digital ground \nto avoid radiating noise to other parts of the board . Never  run these \nnear the r eference inputs. A ground line routed between the SDIN \nand SCLK lines helps reduce crosstalk between them ( this is not \nrequired on a multilayer board that has a separate ground plane,  \nbut separating the lines helps). It is essential to minimize noise on the REFIN line because it couples through to the DAC output.  \nAvoid crossover of digital and analog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the PCB should run at right angles to each \nother. This reduces the effects of feed through the board. A microstrip techn ique is by far the best but not always possible \nwith a double -sided board. In this technique, the component \nside of the board is dedicated to the ground plane , and  signal \ntraces are placed on the solder side.  \nTHERMAL AND  SUPPLY CONSIDERATIONS  \nThe AD5412/ AD5422 are designed to operate at a maximum \njunction temperature of 125°C. It is important that the device s \nnot be operated unde r conditions that cause the junction \ntemperature to exceed this value. Excessive junction tempera -\nture can occur if the AD5412/ AD5422 are operated from the maximum AV DD while  driving the maximum current (24  mA) \ndirectly to ground. In this case , control  the ambient temperature \nor reduce AV DD. The conditions depend on the device package.  \nAt the ambient temperature of 85°C , the 24 -lead TSSOP  package \ncan dissipate 1.14 mW, and the 40 -lead LFCSP package can \ndissipate 1.2 1 W.  \nTo ensure that the junction temperature does not exceed 125°C \nwhile driving the maximum current of 24  mA directly into ground \n(also adding an on -chip cur rent of 3  mA), reduce AV DD from the  \nmaximum rating to ensure that the package is not required to \ndissipate more power than previously stated (see Table 26, \nFigure 80, and Figure 81). \n00.51.01.52.02.5\n40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE (°C)POWER DISSIPATION (W)LFCSP\nTSSOP\n06996-066\n \nFigure 80.

The \nAD5412/ AD5422  are ideal for such applications. Figure 83 shows \nthe AD5412/ AD5422 in a circuit design for an output mod ule, \nspecifically for use in an  industrial control application. T he design  \nprovides for a current or voltage output. The module  is pow ered \nfrom a field supply of 24  V . This supplies AV DD directly. An inverting \nbuck regulator generates the negative supply f or AV SS. For transient \novervoltage protection, t ransient voltage s uppressors (TVS) are \nplaced on all field accessible connections. A 24 V volt  TVS is placed \non each  IOUT, V OUT, +V SENSE, and −VSENSE connection , and a 36  V TVS \nis placed on the field supply input. For added protection, clamping diodes are connected from the I\nOUT, VOUT, +V SENSE, and −VSENSE \npins to the AV DD and AV SS power supply pins. If remote voltage load \nsensing is not required, the +V SENSE pin can be directly connected to \nthe V OUT pin and the – VSENSE pin can be connected to GND.  \nIsolation between the AD5412/ AD5422 and the backplane  \ncircuitry is provided with ADuM1400 and ADuM1200 iCoupler \ndigital isola tors;  further information on i Coupler products is \navailable at www.analog.com/isolators.  The internally generated  \ndigital power supply of the AD5412/ AD5422 powers the field \nside of the digital isolaters , removing the need to generate a digital \npower supply on the field side of the isolation barrier. The AD5412 / \nAD5422 digital supply output supplies  up to 5  mA, which is more  \nthan enough to supply the 2.8 mA requirement s of the ADuM1400 \nand ADuM1200 operating at a logic signal frequency of up to \n1 MHz. To reduce the nu mber of isolators required, non essential  \nsignals such as CLEAR can be connected to GND . FAULT  and \nSDO can be left unconnected , reducing the isolation requirements \nto just three signals. See Circuit Note CN0321 for an example of \na built and tested circuit of a fully isolated, single channel voltage  \nand 4 mA to 20 mA output with HART.  \nINDUSTRIAL HART CAPABLE ANALOG OUTPUT \nAPPLICATION \nMany industrial contr ol applications have requirements for \naccurately controlled current output signals, and th e AD5412/ \nAD5422 are ideal for such applications. Figure 82 shows the \nAD5412/ AD5422 in a circuit design for a HART -enable d output \nmodule, specifically for use in an industrial control application in which both the voltage output and current output are available —\none at a time —on one pin, thus reducing the number of screw \nconnections required. There is no conflict with tying t he two output \npins together because only the voltage output or the current  output \ncan be enabled at any one time.  For further information on this \ncircuit, see Circuit Note CN0278, Complete 4 mA to 20 mA HART Solution with Additional Voltage Output Capability . \nThe design provides for a HART -enabled current output, with \nthe HART capability provided by the AD5700 /AD5700- 1 HART \nmodem, the industry’s lowest power and smallest footprint HART -\ncompliant IC modem. For additional space -savings, the AD5700 -1 \noffers a 0.5% precision internal oscillator. The HART_OUT signa l \nfrom the AD5700 is attenuated and ac -coupled into the RSET pin  \nof the AD5412 /AD5422. Because the RSET pin is used to couple  \nthe HART signal into the AD5412 /AD5422, e ither  the TSSOP or \nLFCSP  package option can be used for this configuration. It should \nbe noted however, that since the TSSOP package does not have a CAP1 pin, C1 (see Figure 82) cannot be inserted in this case. \nWhile the TSSOP equivalent circuit (as in Figure 82 but without \nC1 in place) still passes the HART Communication Foundation physical layer specs, the results with C1 in place are superior to those without C1 in place. Further information on an alternative \nconfiguration, whereby the HART signal is coupled  into the CAP2 \npin can be found in Application Note AN -1065. This is based \non the AD5410/ AD5 420 but can also be applied to the AD5412 / \nAD5422.  Use of either configuration results in the AD5700  HART \nmodem output modulating the 4  mA to 20 mA analog current \nwithout affecting the dc level of the current. This circuit adheres to the HART physical layer specifications as defined by the HART Communication Foundation.  \nThe module is powered from a field supply of ±10.8 V to ± 26.4 V .  \nThis  supplies AV\nDD/AVSS directly. For transient overvoltage \nprotection, transient voltage suppressors (TVS) are placed on both the I\nOUT and field supply connections. A 24 V TVS is placed \non the I OUT connection, and a 36 V TVS is placed on the field \nsupply inpu t(s). For added protection, clamping diodes are \nconnected from the I OUT pin to the AV DD and GND power \nsupply pins. A 10 k Ω current limiting resistor is also placed in \nseries with the positive terminal of the +V SENSE buffer input. This is \nto limit the curre nt to an acceptable level during a transient event.  \n \nAD5412/AD5422  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.
