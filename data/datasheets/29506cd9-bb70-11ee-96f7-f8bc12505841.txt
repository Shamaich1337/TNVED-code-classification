Each playback \nblock is identical.  \nDuring playback I and Q data is read from the storage media and buffered into the FGPA. The FPGA then passes \nthese samples to the playbac k blocks at the required rate.  \n \n3 Each playback block features the following stages:  \n Twin DACs running at 16.368MHz which convert the I and Q data into analog ue signals.  \n A local oscillator that generates the required signal centre frequency.  \n A quadrature m odulator that combines the I and Q signals into a single signal at the required frequency . \n A variable attenuator giving between 0 and 31dB of attenuation.  \nThe outputs from each of the playback stages are then combined, filtered and further attenuated to b ring the signal \nlevels to the high end of the range normally expected for GNSS signals.  \nFinally the resulting signal is split between the RF Out port on the LabSat 3  and an internal GNSS receiver used for \nmonitoring the signals.  \nAs with the record stage th e centre frequency for each channel can be set independently allowing flexibility between \nGPS, GLONASS and Beidou.  \nThanks to each channel having an independently adjustable variable attenuator it is possible to vary the relative \nsignal levels of different constellations within a recording as required.  \nUsage considerations  \nRecording  \nAs with any electronic equipment the LabSat 3  outputs a small amount of unintentional RF energy. Due to the \nweak nature of GNSS signals it is recommended that any electrical equi pment including the LabSat 3 should be \nplaced as far away from any GNSS antennas as possible and kept below the level of the antennas ground plane.  \nIn addition to the normal signal integrity precautions noted above special care should be taken when using the \nLabSat3s internal GNSS monitor. As can been seen from the above block diagram in order for the internal GNSS \nmonitor to operate the RF output path must be active. Due to the low signal levels involved in GNSS it is possible for \na small but noticeable a mount of RF energy to leak from the RF output port while recording if the internal GNSS \nmonitor is active or power save has been disabled. In these circumstances if the unit is placed in close proximity to a \nGNSS antenna this RF leakage can degrade the GNS S signal quality seen by the antenna. If the monitor must be used \nwhile in proximity to a GNSS antenna it is recommended that a 50 ohm terminator be placed on the RF Out port.   \nSignal levels  \nAs shown above the record path includes an AGC stage. Due to the wide range of possible input signal levels this is \nrequired to maintain the incoming signals at a level suitable for digitisation. This process has no impact on the SNR \nlevels of the recorded signals since both the GNSS signal and the noise are amplified e qually. However due to this \nnormalisation of the input signal the RF signal strength of the output will be constant for a set attenuation level and \nwill not accurately reflect the absolute signal level recorded.  \nSignal SNRs  \nIdeally the SNR of a recorded an d replayed GNSS signal will be the same as was seen when observing the live si gnal \nsince both the signal and the in -band noise are recorded and replayed. Unfortunately due to the quantising nature of \nrecord and replay systems there will inevitably be a sli ght drop in observed signal strengths. This is typically in the \nregion of 0.35dB  for a 2 bit recording and  0.8dB  for a 1 bit recording but will vary depending on both the receiver \nused and the signal conditions.  \nSBAS systems such as WAAS or EGNOS operate a t the same centre frequency as GPS and so are automatically \nrecorded as part of any GPS recording. However due to the higher data rate and lower signal power of these signals \na slightly larger decrease in SNR may be observed , this is typically 0.4dB for a 2 bit recording and 1dB for a 1 bit \nrecording.  \n \n4 Technical Specifications  \n LabSat 3  \nSingle  constellation  LabSat 3  \nDual constellation  LabSat 3  \nTriple constellation  \nSimultaneous RF Constellations  1 2 3 \nConstellation s GPS, Galileo, SBAS & QZSS / GLONASS /  Beid ou \nRF Constellation  \nCentre Frequency  (MHz)  1575.4/1602.00/1561.098  \nRecord  \nNumber of Satellites  All in view  \nSampling frequency  16.368  MHz  \nBandwidth  9.66  MHz  per constellation  \nQuantisation  \nmodes per \nchannel  Single \nconstellation mode  1 bit I&Q  \n2 bit I&Q  1 bit I&Q  \n2 bit I&Q  1 bit I&Q  \n2 bit I&Q  \nMultiple \nconstellation mode  N/A 1 bit I&Q  \n 1 bit I&Q  \n \nData Format  I & Q \nInput noise figure  2.7 dB  \nMinimum Input gain  44 dB \nInput AGC dynamic range  59 dB  \nActive Antenna Voltage Supply  2.8 – 3.3 volt \nReplay \nOutput DAC SNR  40 dB \nOutput I & Q crosstalk  95 dB  \nOutput LO phase noise  -93 dBc/Hz  @ 10kHz  \nOutput LO feedthrough  > 40 dB below signal level  \nOutput quadrature phase error  1 degree RMS  \nOutput mixer sidebands  > 30dB below signal level  \nOutput Signal Level  -73dBm /MHz to -103dBm /MHz  in 1dB steps  \nSystem  \nGNSS system SNR loss*  0.35 dB 2 -bit mode  \n0.8 dB 1 -bit mode  \nReference o scillator  \naccuracy  TCXO  +/- 2.5 ppm  \nOCXO  +/- 0.3 ppm  \nReference oscillator \naging  TCXO  +/-1 ppm / year  \nOCXO  +/- 0.3 ppm / year  \nReference oscillator \nstability  TCXO  +/- 0.05 ppm / °C \nOCXO  +/- 0.05 ppm / ° C \n \n5  LabSat 3  \nSingle  constellation  LabSat 3  \nDual constellation  LabSat 3  \nTriple constellation  \nReference oscillator \nphase noise  TCXO  -130 dBc/Hz @1kHz  \nOCXO  -145 dBc/Hz @1kHz  \nExternal reference input  10MHz 50Ω  0.5V to 3V p-p \nUser Control  6 Button Membrane Keypad  \nDisplay  Backlit LCD Dotmatrix  \nAdditional Logging  1 channel CAN, RS232 \nor Digital  (firmware \nupgrade)  2 channels  of CAN, RS232 or Digital  \n \nRemovable Battery Pack  Li_Polymer 2260mAh  \nMedia Sto rage Included  32 G B SD Card & 1TB USB HDD  \nSD Card Media  Class 10 max size 512GB (FAT32)  \nOperating Voltage  8V to 30VDC  \nSize 167mm x 128mm x 43mm  \nWeight  960g with battery (910g without battery)  \nOperating Temperature  -20°C to +60°C  Note: Battery will not  charge below 0°C or above +45°C \n(charger shuts down outside this range) .
