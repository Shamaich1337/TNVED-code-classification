Operation from split power supplies is also \npossible and the low power supply current drain is \nindependent of the magnitude of the power supply \nvoltage.\nApplication areas include transducer amplifiers, DC \ngain blocks and all the conventional op-amp circuits \nwhich now can be more easily implemented in single \npower supply systems. For example, the LM158 \nseries can be directly operated off of the standard \n3.3-V power supply voltage which is used in digital \nsystems and will easily provide the required interface \nelectronics without requiring the additional ±15-V \npower supplies.\nThe LM358 and LM2904 are available in a chip-\nsized package (8-bump DSBGA) using TI\'s DSBGA \npackage technology.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER(1)PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nLM158-NTO-CAN (8) 9.08 mm × 9.09 mm\nCDIP (8) 10.16 mm × 6.502 mm\nLM258-N TO-CAN (8) 9.08 mm × 9.09 mm\nLM2904-NDSBGA (8) 1.31 mm × 1.31 mm\nSOIC (8) 4.90 mm × 3.91 mm\nPDIP (8) 9.81 mm × 6.35 mm\nLM358-NTO-CAN (8) 9.08 mm × 9.09 mm\nDSBGA (8) 1.31 mm × 1.31 mm\nSOIC (8) 4.90 mm × 3.91 mm\nPDIP (8) 9.81 mm × 6.35 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nVoltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)LM158-N , LM258-N , LM2904-N , LM358-N\nSNOSBT3J  – JANUARY 2000 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Recommended Operating Conditions \nindicate conditions for which the device is intended to be functional, but specific performance is not ensured. For ensured \nspecifications and the test conditions, see the Electrical Characteristics.\n(2) Refer to RETS158AX for LM158A military specifications and to RETS158X for LM158 military specifications.\n(3) If Military/Aerospace specified devices are required, please contact the TI Sales Office/Distributors for availability and specifications.\n(4) For operating at high temperatures, the LM358/LM358A, LM2904 must be derated based on a 125°C maximum junction temperature \nand a thermal resistance of 120°C/W for PDIP, 182°C/W for TO-99, 189°C/W for SOIC package, and 230°C/W for DSBGA, which \napplies for the device soldered in a printed circuit board, operating in a still air ambient. The LM258/LM258A and LM158/LM158A can \nbe derated based on a +150°C maximum junction temperature. The dissipation is the total of both amplifiers—use external resistors, \nwhere possible, to allow the amplifier to saturate or to reduce the power which is dissipated in the integrated circuit.\n(5) Short circuits from the output to V+ can cause excessive heating and eventual destruction. When considering short circuits to ground, \nthe maximum output current is approximately 40 mA independent of the magnitude of V+. At values of supply voltage in excess of +15 \nV, continuous short-circuits can exceed the power dissipation ratings and cause eventual destruction. Destructive dissipation can result \nfrom simultaneous shorts on all amplifiers.\n(6) This input current will only exist when the voltage at any of the input leads is driven negative. It is due to the collector-base junction \nof the input PNP transistors becoming forward biased and thereby acting as input diode clamps. In addition to this diode action, there \nis also lateral NPN parasitic transistor action on the IC chip. This transistor action can cause the output voltages of the op amps to go \nto the V+voltage level (or to ground for a large overdrive) for the time duration that an input is driven negative. This is not destructive \nand normal output states will re-establish when the input voltage, which was negative, again returns to a value greater than −0.3 V (at \n25°C).\n6.2 ESD Ratings\nVALUE UNIT\nV(ESD) Electrostatic discharge Human-body model (HBM), per ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-001(1)±250 V\n(1) JEDEC document JEP155 states that 500-V HBM allows safe manufacturing with a standard ESD control process.LM158-N, LM258-N, LM2904-N, LM358-N\nSNOSBT3J – JANUARY 2000 – REVISED MARCH 2022 www.ti.com\n4 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM158-N  LM258-N  LM2904-N  LM358-N\n6.3 Recommended Operating Conditions\nover operating free-air temperature range (unless otherwise noted)\nMIN MAX UNIT\nSupply Voltage (V+ - V-):LM158.

These \namplifiers operate over a wide range of power supply voltage with little change in performance characteristics. At \n25°C amplifier operation is possible down to a minimum supply voltage of 2.3 V DC.\nLarge differential input voltages can be easily accommodated and, as input differential voltage protection diodes \nare not needed, no large input currents result from large differential input voltages. The differential input voltage \nmay be larger than V+ without damaging the device. Protection should be provided to prevent the input voltages \nfrom going negative more than −0.3 V DC (at 25°C). An input clamp diode with a resistor to the IC input terminal \ncan be used.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n_+OUTV+\nV–IN –\nIN +\nCopyright © 2016,\nTexas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 7-1. (Each Amplifier)\n7.3 Feature Description\nThe amplifier\'s differential inputs consist of a non-inverting input (+IN) and an inverting input (–IN). The amplifer \namplifies only the difference in voltage between the two inpus, which is called the differential input voltage. The \noutput voltage of the op-amp Vout is given by Equation 1:\nVOUT = AOL (IN+ - IN-) (1)\nwhere\n•AOL is the open-loop gain of the amplifier, typically around 100dB (100,000x, or 10uV per Volt).\nTo reduce the power supply current drain, the amplifiers have a class A output stage for small signal levels \nwhich converts to class B in a large signal mode. This allows the amplifiers to both source and sink large output \ncurrents. Therefore both NPN and PNP external current boost transistors can be used to extend the power \ncapability of the basic amplifiers. The output voltage needs to raise approximately 1 diode drop above ground to \nbias the on-chip vertical PNP transistor for output current sinking applications.\nFor ac applications, where the load is capacitively coupled to the output of the amplifier, a resistor should be \nused, from the output of the amplifier to ground to increase the class A bias current and prevent crossover \ndistortion. Where the load is directly coupled, as in dc applications, there is no crossover distortion.\nCapacitive loads which are applied directly to the output of the amplifier reduce the loop stability margin. Values \nof 50 pF can be accommodated using the worst-case non-inverting unity gain connection. Large closed loop \ngains or resistive isolation should be used if larger load capacitance must be driven by the amplifier.\nThe bias network of the LM158 establishes a drain current which is independent of the magnitude of the power \nsupply voltage over the range of 3 V DC to 30 V DC.\nOutput short circuits either to ground or to the positive power supply should be of short time duration. Units can \nbe destroyed, not as a result of the short circuit current causing metal fusing, but rather due to the large increase \nin IC chip power dissipation which will cause eventual failure due to excessive junction temperatures.

The larger value of output source current which is available at 25°C provides a larger output current \ncapability at elevated temperatures (see Typical Characteristics ) than a standard IC op amp.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\nFigure 7-2. Schematic Diagram\nThe circuits presented in the Typical Single-Supply Applications  emphasize operation on only a single power \nsupply voltage. If complementary power supplies are available, all of the standard op-amp circuits can be used. \nIn general, introducing a pseudo-ground (a bias voltage reference of V+/2) will allow operation above and below \nthis value in single power supply systems. Many application circuits are shown which take advantage of the wide \ninput common-mode voltage range which includes ground. In most cases, input biasing is not required and input \nvoltages which range to ground can easily be accommodated.www.ti.comLM158-N, LM258-N, LM2904-N, LM358-N\nSNOSBT3J – JANUARY 2000 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: LM158-N  LM258-N  LM2904-N  LM358-N\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and \nTI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for determining \nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe LM158 family bring performance, economy, and ease-of-use to a wide variety of op-amp applications.\n8.2 Typical Applications\n8.2.1 Noninverting DC Gain\nFigure 8-1  shows a high input impedance non-inverting circuit. This circuit gives a closed-loop gain equal to \nthe ratio of the sum of R1 and R2 to R1 and a closed-loop 3 dB bandwidth equal to the amplifier unity-gain \nfrequency divided by the closed-loop gain. This design has the benefit of a very high input impedance, which \nis equal to the differential input impedance multiplied by loop gain. (Open loop gain/Closed loop gain.) In DC \ncoupled applications, input impedance is not as important as input current and its voltage drop across the source \nresistance. Note that the amplifier output will go into saturation if the input is allowed to float. This may be \nimportant if the amplifier must be switched from source to source.\n*R not needed due to temperature independent I IN\nFigure 8-1. Non-Inverting DC Gain (0-V Output)\n8.2.1.1 Design Requirements\nFor this example application, the supply voltage is +5V, and 100x±5% of noninverting gain is necessary. Signal \ninput impedance is approx 10kΩ.\n8.2.1.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nUsing the equation for a non-inverting amplifier configuration ; G = 1+ R2/R1, set R1 to 10k Ω, and R2 to 99x the \nvalue of R1, which would be 990k Ω. Replacing the 990k Ω with a 1M Ω will result in a gain of 101, which is within \nthe desired gain tolerance.\nThe gain-frequency characteristic of the amplifier and its feedback network must be such that oscillation does \nnot occur. To meet this condition, the phase shift through amplifier and feedback network must never exceed \n180° for any frequency where the gain of the amplifier and its feedback network is greater than unity. In practical \napplications, the phase shift should not approach 180° since this is the situation of conditional stability. Obviously \nthe most critical case occurs when the attenuation of the feedback network is zero.LM158-N, LM258-N, LM2904-N, LM358-N\nSNOSBT3J – JANUARY 2000 – REVISED MARCH 2022 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM158-N  LM258-N  LM2904-N  LM358-N\n8.2.1.3 Application Curve\nFigure 8-2.

For decoupling the supply pins it is \nsuggested that 10-nF capacitors be placed as close as possible to the op-amp power supply pins. For single \nsupply, place a capacitor between V+ and V– supply leads. For dual supplies, place one capacitor between V+ \nand ground, and one capacitor between V– and ground.\nPrecautions should be taken to insure that the power supply for the integrated circuit never becomes reversed \nin polarity or that the unit is not inadvertently installed backwards in a test socket as an unlimited current surge \nthrough the resulting forward diode within the IC could cause fusing of the internal conductors and result in a \ndestroyed unit.\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nFor single-ended supply configurations, the V+ pin should be bypassed to ground with a low ESR capacitor. \nThe optimum placement is closest to the V+ pin. Care should be taken to minimize the loop area formed by the \nbypass capacitor connection between V+ and ground. The ground pin should be connected to the PCB ground \nplane at the pin of the device. The feedback components should be placed as close to the device as possible to \nminimize stray parasitics.\nFor dual supply configurations, both the V+ pin and V- pin should be bypassed to ground with a low ESR \ncapacitor. The optimum placement is closest to the corresponding supply pin. Care should be taken to minimize \nthe loop area formed by the bypass capacitor connection between V+ or V- and ground. The feedback \ncomponents should be placed as close to the device as possible to minimize stray parasitics.\nFor both configurations, as ground plane underneath the device is recommended.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 10-1.
