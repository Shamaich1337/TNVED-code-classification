This open-drain output goes \nlow during overcurrent, short-circuit, UVLO, overvoltage \nand undervoltage, overtemperature, or when the output is \nnot regulated (such as a pre-bias output).

PGOOD pin can be connected through a \npullup resistor suggested value 100 k Ω) to a source of 5 Vdc \nor lower.\nSynchronization\nThe module switching frequency can be synchronized to a \nsignal with an external frequency within a specified range. \nSynchronization can be done by using the external signal \napplied to the SYNC pin of the module, with the converter \nbeing synchronized by the rising edge of the external signal. \nThe electrical specifications table specifies the requirements \nof the external SYNC signal. If the SYNC pin is not used, the \nmodule should free run at the default switching frequency. If \nsynchronization is not being used, connect the SYNC pin to \nGND. \nOutput voltage sequencing\nThe SEQ pin can be used when master-slave power-supply \ntracking is required.  \nThe voltage applied to the SEQ pin should be scaled down \nby the same ratio as used to scale the output voltage down \nto the reference voltage of the module. This is accomplished \nby an external resistive divider connected across the  \nsequencing voltage before it is fed to the SEQ pin.   \nThe minimum recommended delay between the ON/OFF \nsignal and the sequencing signal is 10 ms to ensure that the \nmodule output is ramped up according to the sequencing \nsignal. This ensures that the module soft-start routine is  \ncompleted before the sequencing signal is allowed to ramp \nup.  \nWhen an analog voltage is applied to the SEQ pin, the  \noutput voltage tracks this voltage until the output reaches the \nset-point voltage. The final value of the SEQ voltage must be \nset higher than the set-point voltage of the module. The  \noutput voltage follows the voltage on the SEQ pin on a  \none-to-one basis. By connecting multiple modules together, \nmultiple modules can track their output voltages to the volt -\nage applied on the SEQ pin.  \nTo initiate simultaneous shutdown of the modules, the SEQ \npin voltage is lowered in a controlled manner. The output  \nvoltage of the modules tracks the voltages below their  \nsetpoint voltages on a one-to-one basis. A valid input voltage \nmust be maintained until the tracking and output voltages \nreach ground potential. \nThe SEQ pin can be used when master-slave power-supply tracking is required  \nRemote ON/OFF\n5Technical Data 11183\nEffective May 2021EPM12V2  \nNon-isolated DC-DC converter \n  \nwww.eaton.com/electronics\nMechanical dimension and pinning - inches\nProjection: Third angle projection  \nTolerance: ± 0.01 \nPad 1&5~12 = 0.04 x 0.04\nPad 2~4 = 0.07 x 0.157\nNC = no connection  \nPad 1 & 5~17 = 0.041” x 0.041”  \nPad 2&4 = 0.165” x 0.074”  \nMarking\nxxx= lot code   EMC filtering circuit\nDC/DC\nConv erterLoadVin\nC1L1\n+Vin\nGND\nC2L2\nC3\nGVo\nGL3\nClass C1 L1 C2 L2 C3 L3\nClass A 100 µF/ 25 V 8 mH 100 µF/ 25 V 12 mH 470 µF/ 25 V 35 µHETF and surge circuit\nDC/DC\nConv erterLoadTVSC 1\nTVS C1\nEaton P4SMA13CA 10000 µF 25 V\nRecommended pad layout\nPin Function Pin Function\n1 On/Off 10 PGOOD\n2 Vin 11 SYNC\n3 GND 12 VS-\n4 Vout 13 SIG_GND\n5 VS+ (Sense) 14 NC\n6 TRIM 15 NC\n7 GND 16 NC\n8 NC 17 NC\n9 SEQ\n6Technical Data 11183\nEffective May 2021EPM12V2  \nNon-isolated DC-DC converter \n  \nwww.eaton.com/electronics\nPackaging- Inches\n\nEaton\nElectronics Division\n1000 Eaton Boulevard\nCleveland, OH 44122\nUnited States\nEaton.com/electronics\n© 2021 Eaton\nAll Rights Reserved\nPrinted in USA\nPublication No. 11183\nMay 2021Technical Data  11183\nEffective May 2021EPM12V2  \nNon-isolated DC-DC converter \n  \nLife Support Policy: Eaton does not authorize the use of any of its products for use in life support devices or systems without the express written \napproval of an officer of the Company.
