FEATURES  \nSingle -supply operation  \nWide bandwidth: 4 MHz  \nLow offset voltage: 65 μV \nUnity -gain stable  \nHigh slew rate: 4.0 V/ μs \nLow noise: 3.9 nV/ √Hz  \nAPPLICATIONS  \nBattery -powered instrumentation  \nPower supply control and protection  \nTelecom munications  \nDAC output  amplifier  \nADC input buffer  \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe OP184 /OP284 /OP484  are single, dual, and quad single -supply, \n4 MHz bandwidth amplifiers featuring rail -to-rail inputs and \noutputs. They are guaranteed to operate from 3 V to 36 V (or \n±1.5 V to ±18 V).  \nThes e amplifiers are superb for single -supply applications requiring \nboth ac and precision dc performance. The combination of wide \nbandwidth, low noise, and precision makes the OP184 /OP284 / \nOP484  useful in a wide variety of applications, including filters \nand instrumentation.   \nOther applications for these amplifiers include portable telecom -\nmunications  equipment, power  supply control and protection,  \nand use as amplifiers or buffers for transducers with wide output \nranges. Sensors requiring a rail -to-rail input ampli fier include \nHall effect, piezoelectric, and resistive transducers.  \nThe ability to swing rail -to-rail at both the input and output \nenables designers to build multistage filters in single -supply \nsystems and to maintain high signal -to-noise ratios.  \nThe OP184 /OP284 /OP484  are specified over the hot extended \nindustrial  temperature range of −40°C to +125°C . The single  \nOP184 is available in 8 -lead SOIC surface mount packages. The \ndual  OP284 is available in 8 -lead PDIP and SOIC surface mount \npackages. The quad OP484 is available in 14- lead PDIP and  \n14-lead, narrow -body SOIC packages.  PIN CONFIGURATIONS  \n1\n234\nOUT AV+\nDNCNC DNC\n–IN A\n+IN A\nV–8\n7\n6\n5\nNOTES\n1. NC = NO CONNECT2.

J | Page 14 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON \nThe OP184/OP284/OP484 are precision single -supply, rail- to-rail \noperational amplifiers. Intended for the portable instrumentation \nmarketplace,  the OPx84 family of devices combine the attributes \nof precision, wide bandwidth, and low noise to make them a superb \nchoice in single -supply appl ications that require both ac and \nprecision dc performance. Other low supply voltage appli -\ncations for which the OP284 is well suited are active filters, audio microphone preamplifiers, power supply control, and telecommunications. To combine all of these attributes with rail-to-rail input/output operation, novel circuit design techniques  \nare used.  \nD1\nD2Q4V+\nI1\nQ3 2 Q 1 Q\nI2V01\nV02–IN x\nV–+IN x\n00293-044–\n–\nR4\n3kΩR3\n3kΩR24kΩR1\n4kΩ\n \nFigure 44. OP284 Equivalent Input Circuit  \nFor example, Figure 44 illustrates a simplified equivalent circui t \nfor the input stage of the OP184/OP284/OP484. It comprises  \nan NPN differential pair, Q1→Q2, and a PNP differential pair,  \nQ3→Q4, operating concurrently. Diode Network D1→Diode \nNetwork D2 serves to clamp the applied differential input \nvoltage to the OP284, thereby protecting the input transistors against avalanche damage. Input stage voltage gains are kept low for input rail -to-rail operation. The two pairs of differential \noutpu t voltages are connected to the  second stage of the OP284, \nwhich is a compound folded cascade gain stage. It is also in the second gain stage, where the two pairs of di fferential output \nvoltages are combined into a single -ended, output signal voltage \nused to drive the output stage. A key issue in the input stage is \nthe behavior of the input bias currents over the input common -\nmode voltage range. Input bias currents in th e OP284 are the \narithmetic sum of the base currents in Q1 →Q3 and in Q2→Q4. \nAs a result of this design approach, the input bias currents in \nthe OP284 not only exhibit different amplitudes; they also exhibit different polarities. This effect is best illustra ted by \nFigure 10. It is, therefore, of paramount importance that the \neffective source impedances connected to the OP284 inputs  \nbe balanced for optimum dc and ac performance.  To achieve rail -to-rail output, the OP284 output stag e design \nemploys a unique topology for both sourcing and sinking current. This circuit topology is illustrated in Figure 45. The output stage \nis voltage -driven from the second gain stage. The signal path \nthrough the output stage  is inverting; that is, for positive input \nsignals, Q1 provides the base current drive to Q6 so that it conducts (sinks) current. For negative input signals, the signal path via \nQ1→Q2→D1→Q4→Q3 provides the base current drive for Q5 to \nconduct (source) curr ent. Both amplifiers provide output current \nuntil they are forced into saturation, which occurs at approxi-\nmately 20 mV from the negative supply rail and 100 mV from the positive supply rail. \n00293-045V+\nI2\nI1Q1 Q3\nQ4\nQ2\nV–Q5\nVOUT\nQ6\nR6 R3R2R1R4\nR5D1INPUT FROM\nSECOND GAIN\nSTAGE\n \nFigure 45. OP284 Equivalent Output Ci rcuit  \nThus, the saturation voltage of the output transistors sets the limit on the OP284 maximum output voltage swing. Output short -circuit current limiting is determined by the maximum \nsignal current into the base of Q1 from the second gain stage. Under o utput short -circuit conditions, this input current level  \nis approximately 100 µA. With transistor current gains around 200,  \nthe short- circuit current limits are typically 20 mA. The output \nstage also exhibits voltage gain. This is accomplished by the use of common -emitter amplifiers, and, as a result, the voltage gain \nof the output stage (thus, the open -loop gain of the device) \nexhibits a dependence to the total load resistance at the output of the OP284.  \nINPUT OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION \nAs with any semiconduc tor device, if conditions exist where the \napplied input voltages to the device exceed either supply voltage,  \nthe input overvoltage I -V characteristic of the device must be \nconsidered. When an overvoltage occurs, the amplifier could be damaged, depending on  the magnitude of the applied voltage \nand the magnitude of the fault current. Figure 46 illustrates the \novervoltage I -V characteristic of the OP284. This graph was \ngenerated with the supply pins connected to GND and a curve tracer’s collector output drive connected to the input.  \n  OP184/OP284/OP484 \n \nRev.

Input Overvoltage I -V Characteristics of the OP284  \nAs shown in Figure 46, internal p -n junctions to the OP284 \nenergize and permit current flow from the inputs to the supplies \nwhen the input is 1.8 V more positive and 0.6 V more negative \nthan the respective supply rails. As illustrated in the simplified equivalent circuit shown in Figure 44, the OP284 does not have \nany intern al current limiting resistors; thus, fault currents can \nquickly rise to damaging levels. \nThis input current is not inherently damaging to the device, \nprovided that it is limited to 5 mA or less. For the OP284, once the input exceeds the negative supply by 0.6 V , the input current quickly exceeds 5 mA. If this condition continues to exist, an external series resistor should be added at the expense of addi -\ntional thermal noise. Figure 47 illustrates a typical noninverting \nconfiguration for an overvoltage -protected amplifier where the \nseries resistance, R\nS, is chosen such that  \n( )\nmA 5SUPPLY MAXIN\nSV V\nR−\n=  \nFor example, a 1 k Ω resistor protects the OP284 against input \nsignals up to 5 V above and below the supplies. For other configu-rations where both inputs are used, each input should be protected against abuse with a series resistor. Again, to ensure optimum dc and ac perfor mance, it is recommended that source impedance \nlevels  be balanced. \nR1R2\nVINVOUT1/2\nOP284\n00293-047 \nFigure 47. Resistance in Series with Input Limits Overvoltage Currents  \n to Safe Values \nOUTPUT PHASE REVERSAL \nSome operational amplifiers designed for single -suppl y operation \nexhibit an output voltage phase reversal when their inputs are \ndriven beyond their useful common -mode range. Typically, for \nsingle- supply bipolar op amps, the negative supply determines \nthe lower limit of their common -mode range. With these devices,   external clamping diodes, with the anode connected to ground and the cathode to the inputs, prevent input signal excurs ions \nfrom exceeding the negative supply  of the device  (that is, GND), \npreventing a condition that causes the output voltage to cha nge \nphase. JFET -input amplifiers can also exhibit phase reversal;  \nand, if so, a series input resistor is usually required to prevent it.  \nThe OP284 is free from reasonable input voltage range restrictions,  \nprovided that input voltages no greater than the su pply voltages \nare applied. Although device output does not change phase, large \ncurrents can flow through the input protection diodes , as shown \nin Figure 46. Therefore, the technique  recommended in the Inp ut \nOvervoltage Protection  section should be applied to those appli -\ncations where the likelihood of input voltages exceeding the \nsupply voltages is high.  \nDESIGNING LOW NOISE CIRCUITS IN SINGLE -\nSUPPLY APPLICATIONS  \nIn single -supply applications, devices like  the OP284 extend the \ndynamic range of the application through the use of rail -to-rail \noperation. In fact, the OPx84 family is the first of its kind to \ncombine single -supply, rail- to-rail operation , and low noise in \none device. It is the first device in th e industry to exhibit an input \nnoise voltage spectral density of less than 4 nV/ √Hz at 1 kHz. \nIt was also designed specifically for low- noise, single -supply \napplications, and as such, some discussion on circuit noise \nconcepts in single -supply applications is appropriate.  \nReferring to the op amp noise model circuit configuration \nillustrated in Figure 48, t he expression for an amplifier’s  total \nequivalent input noise voltage for a source resistance level, R S,  \nis given by  \n[ ]2 2 2) ( ) ( ) ( 2nOA S nOA nR nTe e e R i+ × + = , units in \nHzV \nwhere:  \nRS = 2R is the effective, or equivalent, circuit source resistance.  \n(enR)2 is the source resistance  thermal noise voltage power (4 kTR) . \nk is the Boltzmann’s constant = 1.38 × 10–23 J/K. \nT is the ambient temperature in Kelvins of the circuit = 273.15 +  \nTA (°C).  \n(inOA)2 is the op am p equivalent input noise current spectral power \n(1 Hz bandwidth).  \n(enOA)2 is the op amp equivalent input noise voltage spectral power \n(1 Hz bandwidth).  \nenR\nenRenOA\ninOA\ninOAR\nNOISELESS\nR\nNOISELESS\n00293-048IDEAL\nNOISELESS\nOP AMP\nRS = 2R\n \nFigure 48.

OP284 Equivalent Thermal Noise vs. Total Source Resistance  \nBecause c ircuit SNR is the critical parameter in the final analysis, \nthe noise behavior of a circuit is often expressed in terms of its \nnoise figure, NF. The noise figure is defined as the ratio of a circuit’s output signal- to-noise to its input signal -to-noise.  \nAn expression of a circuit NF in dB, and in terms of the opera tional amplifier voltage and current noise parameters \ndefined previously, is given by  \n( )( )( )\n( ) \uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\uf8ee\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb × ++ =22 2\n1 log 10 dB\nnRSS nOA nOA\neR i eNF  \nwhere:  \nNF (dB ) is the noise figure  of the circuit, expressed in decibels . \n(enOA)2 is the OP284 noise voltage spectral power (1 Hz bandwidth ). \n(inOA)2 is the OP284 noise c urrent spectral power (1 Hz bandwidth ). \n(enRS)2 is the source resistance thermal noise voltage power = \n(4kTR S). \nRS is the effective, or equivalent, source resistance presented to \nthe amplifier.  \nCalculation of the c ircuit noise figu re is straightforward b ecause \nthe signal level in the application is not required to determine it. However, many designers using NF calculations as the basis for achieving optimum SNR believe that  a low noise figure is equal to \nlow total noise. In fact, th e opposite is true, as shown in Figure 50.\nThe n\noise figure of the OP284 is expressed as a function of \nthe s\nource resistance level. Note that the lowest noise figure for \nthe OP284 occurs at a source resistance level of 10 k Ω. \nHowever, Figure 49 shows that this source resistance level and \nthe OP284 generate approximately 14 nV/ √Hz of total \nequivalent circuit noise. Signal levels in the application invariably increase to maximize circuit SNR, which is not an \noption in low voltage, single -supply applications.

OP284 Noise Figure vs. Source Resistance \nTherefore, to achieve  optimum circuit SNR in single -supply \napplications,  it is recommended that an operational amplifie r \nwith the lowest equivalent input noise voltage be chosen, along \nwith  source  resistance levels  that are  consistent with maintaining  \nlow total circuit noise.  \nOVERDRIVE RECOVERY  \nThe overdrive recovery time of an operational amplifier is the \ntime required for the output voltage to recover to its linear region \nfrom a saturated condition. The recovery time is important in applications where the amplifier must recover quickly after a large transient event. The circuit shown in Figure 51 was used \nto evaluate the OP284 overload  recovery time. The OP284 \ntakes  approximately 2 µs to recover from positive saturation \nand approximately 1 µs to recover from negative saturation.  \n2\n31+5V\n8\n4R1\n10kΩ\nR3\n9kΩR2\n10kΩ\nVIN\n10V STEP\n–5VVOUT1/2\nOP284\n00293-051 \nFigure 51.

The circuit uses the classic two op amp \ninstrumentation amplifier topology with four resistors to set the \ngain. The transfer equation of the circuit is identical to that of a \nnoninverting amplifier. Resistor R2 and Resistor R3 should be closely matched to each other, as well as to Resistors (R1 + P1) and Resistor R4 to ensure good common -mode rejection \nperformance.  \n \n \n  OP184/OP284/OP484 \n \nRev.

Matched networks also exhibit tight rela tive \nresistor temperature coefficients for good circuit temperature \nstability. Trimming Potentiometer P1 is used for optimum dc CMR adjustment, and C1 is used to optimize ac CMR . With the \ncircuit values as shown, Circuit CMR  is better  than 80 dB over the \nfrequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz.  Circuit referred -to-input \n(RTI)  noise in the 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz band is an impressively low \n0.45 μV p -p. Resistor RP1 and Resistor RP2 serve to p rotect the \nOP284 inputs against input overvoltage abuse. Capacitor C2 can be included to the limit circuit bandwidth and, therefore, wide bandwidth noise in sensitive applications. The value of this capacitor should be adjusted , depending on the re quired c losed -\nloop bandwidth of  the circuit. The R4 to C2 time constant creates \na pole at a frequency equal to  \n( )2 4 213C RdBfπ=  \n2.5 V REFERENCE FROM  A 3 V SUPPLY \nIn many single -supply applications, the need for a 2.5 V reference \noften arises. Many commercia lly available monolithic 2.5 V \nreferences require at least a minimum operating supply of 4 V . The problem is exacerbated when the minimum operating supply voltage is 3 V . The circuit illustrated in Figure 53 is an \nexample of a 2. 5 V reference that operates from a single 3 V \nsupply.

While \nsourcing a steady -state load current of 1 mA, this circuit recovers  \nto 0.01% of the programmed output voltage in 1.5 μs for a total \nchange in load current of ±1 mA.  \n00293-0532.5V REF3\n213V\n8\n4\nR3\n100kΩR2\n100kΩP1\n5kΩR1\n17.4kΩ3V\n0.1µF\nAD5891/2\nOP284+\n–\nRESISTORS = 1%, 100ppm/°C\nPOTENTIOMETER = 10 TURN, 100ppm/°C \nFigure 53. 2.5 V Reference That Operates on a Single 3 V Supply  \n5 V ONLY, 12 -BIT DAC SWINGS RAIL -TO-RAIL  \nThe OP284 is ideal for use with a CMOS DAC to generate a digitally controlle d voltage with a wide output range.

The op amp provides a low impedance \noutpu t to drive any following circuitry.  \nSecond, the op amp amplifies the output signal to provide a rail -\nto-rail output swing. In this particular case, the gain is set to 4.1 \nso that the circuit generates a 5 V output when the DAC output \nis at full scale. If other output voltage ranges are needed, such as \n0 V ≤ V OUT ≤ 4.095 V , the gain can be easily changed by adjusting  \nthe values of R2 and R3.  \n \n \nOP184/OP284/OP484   \n \nRev. J | Page 18 of 24 HIGH- SIDE CURRENT MONITOR  \nIn the design of power supply control circuits, a great deal of design  \neffort is focused on ensuring the long- term reliability of a pass \ntransistor over a wide range of load current conditions. As a result, \nmonitoring and limiting device power dissipation is of prime \nimportance in these designs. The circuit shown  in Figure 55 is \nan example of a 3 V , single -supply, h igh-side current monitor that \ncan be incorporated into the design of a voltage regulator with fold-back current limiting or a high current power supply with \ncrowbar protection. This design uses an OP284 rail -to-rail input \nvoltage range to sense the voltage  drop across a 0.1 Ω current shunt.  \nA P-channel MOSFET , used as the feedback element in the circuit , \nconverts the differential input voltage of the op amp into a current. \nThis current is applied to R2 to generate a voltage that is a linear \nrepresentation o f the load current. The transfer equation for the \ncurrent monitor is given by  \nMonitor Output = \nLSENSEIR1RR2 ×\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb×  \nFor the element values shown, the transfer characteristic of the \nmonitor output is 2.5 V/A.  \n00293-055RSENSE\n0.1ΩIL\n8\n1\n433V3V\nGS\nD2\nM1\nSI9433\nMONITOR\nOUTPUT3V\n1/2\nOP284R1\n100Ω\nR2\n2.49kΩ0.1µF\n \nFigure 55. High -Side Load Current Monitor \nCAPACITIVE LOAD DRIVE CAPABILITY  \nThe OP284 exhibits excellent capacitive load driving capabilities.  \nIt can drive up to 1 nF, as shown in Figure 30. Even though the \ndevice is stable, a capacitive load does not come without penalty in \nbandwidth. The bandwidth is reduced to less than 1 MHz for loads \ngreater than 2 nF. A snubber network on the output does not \nincrease the bandwidth, but it does significantly reduce the amount \nof overshoot for a given capacitive  load.  \nA snubber consists of a series R -C network (R S, C S), as shown in \nFigure 56, connected from the output of the device to ground. \nThis network operates in parallel with the load capacitor, C L, to \nprovide the necessary phase lag compensation. The value of the resistor and capacitor is best determined empirically.  \n00293-056RS\n50Ω0.1µF\nCL\n1nFCS\n100nF5V\nVIN\n100mV p-pVOUT1/2\nOP284\n \nFigure 56. Snubber Network Compensates for Capacitive Load  \nThe first step is to determine the value of Resistor R S. A good \nstarting value is 10 0 Ω (typically, the optimum value is less than \n100 Ω). This value is reduced until the small- signal transient \nresponse is optimized. Next, C S is determined; 10 μF is a good \nstarting point. This value is reduced to the smallest value for acceptable performance (typically, 1 μF). For the case of a 10 nF \nload capacitor on the OP284, the optimal snubber network is  \na 20 Ω in series with 1 μF. The benefit is immediately apparent, \nas shown in the scope photo in Figure 57. The top trac e was taken \nwith a 1 nF load, and the bottom trace was taken with the 50 Ω, \n100 nF snubber network in place. The amount of over shoot and \nringing is dramatically reduced.

J | Page 19 of 24 LOW DROPOUT REGULATOR WITH CURRENT \nLIMITING  \nMany circuits require stable, regulated voltages relatively close  \nin potential to an unregulated input source. This low dropout \ntype of regulator is re adily implemented with a rail -to-rail output  \nop amp, such as the OP284, because the wide output swing allows easy drive to a low saturation voltage pass device. Furthermore, \nit is particularly useful when the op amp also employs a rail- to-\nrail input featur e because this factor allows it to perform high -\nside current sensing for positive rail current limiting. Typical examples are voltages developed from 3 V to 9 V range system sources or anywhere that low dropout performance is required \nfor power efficiency.  This 4.5 V example  works from 5 V nominal \nsources with worst -case levels down to 4.6 V or less. Figure 58 \nshows such a regulator set up, using an OP284 plus a low R\nDS(ON) , \nP-channel MOSFET pass device. Part of the low dropout pe rform -\nance of this circuit is provided by Q1, which has a rating of 0.11 \nΩ with a gate drive voltage of only 2.7 V . This relatively low gate drive threshold allows operation of the regulator on supplies as low as 3 V without compromising overall performance.  \nThe main voltage control loop operation of the circuit is \nprovided by U1B, half of the OP284. This voltage control \namplifier amplifies the 2.5 V reference voltage produced by Three Terminal U2, a REF192. The regulated output voltage, V\nOUT, is then  \n\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb+ =31RR2V V2 OUT OUT  For this example, because V OUT of 4.5 V with V OUT2 = 2.5 V requires  \na U1B gain of 1.8 times, R3 and R2 are chosen for a ratio of 1.2:1 or \n10.0 k Ω:8.06 kΩ (using closest 1% values). Note that for the lowest \nVOUT dc error, R2||R3 should be maintained equal to R1 (as in \nthis example), and the R2 to R3 resistors should be stable, close tolerance metal film types. The table in Figure 58 summarizes \nR1 to R3 values for some popular voltages. However, note that, \nin general, the output can be anywhere between V\nOUT2 and the \n12 V maximum rating of Q1.  \nWhile the low voltage saturation characteristic of Q1 is a key part  \nof the l ow dropout, another component is a low current sense com -\nparison threshold with good dc accuracy. Here, this is provided by \nCurrent Sense Amplifier U1A, which is provided by a 20 mV \nreference from the 1.235 V , AD5 89 Reference Diode D2, and the \nR7 to R8 divider. When the product of the output current and the R\nS value match this voltage threshold, the current control loop is \nactivated, and U1A drives the Q1 gate through D1. This causes the \noverall circuit operation to enter current mode control with a current limit, I\nLIMIT, defined as  \n( )\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb\n+\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb=R8 RR7\nRVI\nSD2 R\nLIMIT7 \n \n \n3\n218\n4U1A\nOP284\nU1B\nOP284D2\nAD589D1\n1N4148Q1\nSI9433DY\n6\n57\nD3\n1N4148\n2\n6\n43U2\nREF192\nR3\n10kΩVC\nVIN COMMON+VS\nVS > V OUT + 0.1VC40.1µF\nC5\n0.01µF\nC2\n1µFC1\n0.01µF\nC610µF\nV\nOUT COMMONVOUT =\n4.5V @ 350mA\n(SEE TABLE)\nC2\n0.1µF\nOPTIONAL\nON/OFF CONTROL INPUT\nCMOS HI (OR OPEN) = ON\nLO = OFFVOUT R1kΩ R2kΩ R3kΩOUTPUT TABLE\n5.0V 4.99 10.0 10.04.5V 4.53 8.08 10.03.3V 2.43 3.24 10.03.0V 1.69 2.00 10.0R5\n22.1kΩ\nR4\n2.21kΩR64.99kΩ\nR927.4kΩ\nR11\n1kΩ\nR10\n1kΩR14.53kΩ\nV\nOUT2\n2.5VR7\n4.99kΩ\nR8\n301kΩ\nR2\n8.06kΩRS\n0.05Ω\n00293-058 \nFigure 58.

J | Page 20 of 24 Obviously, it is desirable to keep this comparison voltage small \nbecaus e it becomes a significant portion of the overall dropout \nvoltage. Here, the 20 mV reference is higher than the typical offset of the OP284 but is still reasonably low as a percentage  \nof V\nOUT (<0.5%). In adapting the limiter for other I LIMIT levels, \nSense  Resistor R S should be adjusted along with R7 to R8, to \nmaintain this threshold voltage between 20 mV and 50 mV .  \nPerformance of the circuit is excellent. For the 4.5 V output version, the measured dc output change for a 225 mA load change was on the order of a few microvolts, while the dropout \nvoltage at this same current level was about 30 mV . The current limit, as shown  in Figure 58, is 400 mA, allowing the circuit to \nbe used at levels up to 300 mA or more. While the Q1 device c an \nactually  support currents of several amperes, a practical current \nrating takes into account the 2.5 W , 25°C dissipation of the  \n8-lead SOIC  device. Because a short -circuit current of 400 mA \nat an input level of 5 V causes a 2 W dissipation in Q1, other input \nconditions must  be considered carefully in terms of potential \noverheating of Q1. Of course, if higher powered devices are used for Q1, this circuit can support outputs of tens of amperes as well as the higher V\nOUT levels already noted. \nThe circuit shown can either be used as a standard low dropout \nregulator, or it can be used with on/off control. By driving Pin 3 of U 2 with the optional logic control signal, V\nC, the output is \nswitched between on and off. Note that when the output is off in this circui t, it is still active (that is, not an open circuit). This \nis because the off state simply reduces the voltage input to R1, leaving the U1A/U1B amplifiers and Q1 still active.  \nWhen the on/off control is used, Resistor R10 should be used \nwith U 2 to speed o n/off switching and to allow the output of the \ncircuit to settle to a nominal zero voltage. Component D3 and Component R11 also aid in speeding up the on/off transition by providing a dynamic discharge path for C2. Off/on transition time is less than 1 ms, while the on/off transition is longer, but \nless than 10 ms. \n3 V, 50 HZ/60 HZ ACTIVE NOTCH FILTER WIT H \nFALSE GROUND  \nTo process signals in a single -supply system, it is often best to use \na false ground biasing scheme. A circuit that uses this approach  is \nshown in Figure 59. In this circuit, a false ground circuit biases \nan active notch filter used to reject 50 Hz/60 Hz power line \ninterference in portable patient monitoring equipment.  Notch filters are commonly used to reject power line frequency \ninterference that often obscures low frequency physiological signals, such as heart rates, blood pressure readings, EEGs, and EKGs. This notch filter effectively squelches 60 Hz pickup at a Filter Q of 0.75. Substituting 3.16 k Ω resistors for the 2.67 k Ω \nresistor in  the twin -T section (R1 through R5) configures the \nactive filter to reject 50 Hz interference.  \n00293-059R2\n2.67kΩ\nR6\n10kΩR7\n1kΩR81kΩ\nR11\n10kΩ\nR920kΩR12\n150Ω\nR1020kΩ1\n35\n67 1123V\nVO VIN A2A1\n8 A34\n1093V\nA1, A2, A3 = OP484Q = 0.75\nNOTE: FOR 50Hz APPLICATIONS\nCHANGE R1, R2, R3, AND R4 TO 3.1k Ω\nAND R5 TO 1.58k Ω (3.16kΩ ÷ 2).R3\n2.67kΩR1\n2.67kΩ\nR4\n2.67kΩ\nR5\n1.33kΩ(2.68kΩ ÷ 2)C3\n2µF\n(1µF × 2)\nC5\n0.03µFC1\n1µFC2\n1µF\nC4\n1µFC61µF1.5V\n \nFigure 59.

It buffers  \nthe voltage developed at R9 and R10 and is the reference for the active notch filter. Because the OP484 exhibits a rail -to-rail input \ncommon -mode range, R9 and R10 are chosen to split the 3 V \nsupply symmetr ically. An in -the-loop compensation scheme is \nused around the OP484 that allows the op amp to drive C6, a 1 μF capacitor, without oscillation. C6 maintains a low impedance \nac ground over the operating frequency range of the filter.  \nThe filter section uses an OP484 in a Twin- T configuration whose \nfrequency selectivity is very sensitive to the relative matching of  \nthe capacitors and resistors in the twin -T section. Mylar is the \nmaterial of choice for the capacitors, and the relative matching of the capacitors and resistors determines the pass band symmetry of the filter. Using 1% resistors and 5% capacitors produce s satis-\nfactory results.  \n \n \n \n \n  OP184/OP284/OP484 \n \nRev.
