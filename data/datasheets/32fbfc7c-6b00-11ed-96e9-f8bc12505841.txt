Patent Protected. Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited.  \n © 2021  MPS. All Rights Reserved.  \nOPERATION\nThe MPM3695 -100 is a fully integrated power \nmodule with up to 100A of continuous output \ncurrent on a BGA (15mmx30mmx5.18mm) \npackage . For applications that require  more than \n100A, up to eight  MPM3695 -100 modules can be \nconnected in parallel to deliver an outpu t current \nup to 800A. The MPM3695 -100 employs multi -\nphase constant -on-time ( MCOT) control to \nprovide  fast transient response. Internal ramp \ncompensation  guarantees stable operation for \napplications using zero-ESR ceramic output \ncapacitors.   \nPoly -Phase Architecture  \nThe MPM3695 -100 integrates  four sets of half -\nbridges  with a power controller  in each module. \nIn single -module operation, the four phases are \nphase -shifted by 90 ° to minimize the output \nvoltage ripple. One of the internal phases must \nbe configured as the master phase , and the \nother three phases are slave phases.  \nMCOT Operation: Master Phase  \nThe master phase performs the following \nfunctions:  \n\uf0b7 Accept s both write and read commands \nthrough the PMBus from a host . \n\uf0b7 Generate s the SET signal . \n\uf0b7 Manage s start-up, shutdown,  and all of the \nprotection functions . \n\uf0b7 Monitor s fault alert s from the slave phases \nthrough the PG pin . \n\uf0b7 Generate s the first on pulse . \n\uf0b7 Generate s the on pulse when receiving RUN \nand SET signals . \n\uf0b7 Dynamically adjusts its on  time to ensure \nequal current sharing . \n\uf0b7 Generate s the PASS signal . \nMCOT Operation: Slave Phases  \nThe slave phase s perform the following \nfunctions:  \n\uf0b7 Accept write commands through the PMBus \nfrom a host . \n\uf0b7 Receive SET signal (s) from a master  phase . \uf0b7 Start the on pulse when receiving RUN and \nSET signals . \n\uf0b7 Dynamically adjust their on time to ensure \nequal current sharing on their own phase \nbased on the per -phase and total current.  \n\uf0b7 Generate the  PASS signal   \nParallel  Operation   \nIn parallel configuration, one master module and \nup to seven  slave modules are connected in \nparallel. The output current (IOUT) is shared \nequally between  all MPM3695 -100 power \nmodules  with active current balancing . The \nTypical Application Circuit s section on page 47  \nillustrates two and four MPM3695 -100s in \nparallel configuration.  In parallel operation, each  \nswitching period is divided  by up to eight  \ninterleaved phases with 45 ° phase -shifting. For \nfour-module operation, two half -bridges are \nturned on simultaneously  at each PWM pulse. \nThe TAKE pin of the master module must  be \npulled up to a voltage source through a resistor. \nThe MPM3695 -100 detects its master/slave \nconfiguration by monitoring the state of the \nTAKE pin during start -up. The RUN and TAKE \npins of all phases are connected in a cascaded \nmanner .  \nRamp Compensation  \nThe MPM3695 -100 operates with zero -ESR \nceramic output capacitors by using internal ramp  \ncompensation. A triangular RAMP signal is \ngenerated internally, then superimposed onto \nthe FB signal.  \nThe triangular RAMP signal starts to rise once \n(VFB + RAMP)  drops below the reference signal  \nand a SET pulse is generated. The RAMP signal \nrise time is fixed. The amplitude of the ramp  \ncompensation is selectable through register D0h, \nbits[3:1] to support a wide range of operation \nconfigurations.  \nThere is a tradeoff between stability and load \ntransient response. A larger RAMP signal \nprovides better stability but slower load transient \nresponse, and vice versa. Optimize ramp  \ncompensation selection based on the design \ncriteria for each application  (see Table 6 on page \n19). \nMPM3695 -100 – 16V, 100A, SCALABLE  DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS  \nMPM3695 -100 Rev. 1.0 MonolithicPower.com  19 \n3/25/2021  MPS Proprietary Information.

All Rights Reserved.  \nPMBUS INTERFACE  \nPMBus Serial Interface Description  \nThe Power Management Bus (PMBus) is an \nopen -standard, power management protocol \nthat defines a means of communication with \npower conversion and other devices.  \nThe PMBus  is a two-wire, bidirectional , serial \ninterface, consisting of a data line (SDA)  and a \nclock line (SCL). The lines are externally pulled \nup to a bus voltage when they are in an idle state . \nWhen connecting to the lines, a master device \ngenerates the SCL signal and device address, \nthen arranges the communication sequence.  \nThe MPM3695 -100 is a PMBus  slave device that  \nsupport s both standard mode (100kHz) and fast \nmode s (400kHz and 1000 kHz).  \nSlave Address  \nA unique address should be set for each slave \ndevice that is connected to the same PMBus . \nThe ADDR pin configures  the address for the \nMPM 3695 -100. There  is a 10 µA current flow ing \nout of the ADDR pin . Connect a resistor between \nthe ADDR pin and AGND to set the ADDR \nvoltage. The internal  analog -to-digital converter  \n(ADC ) converts the ADDR pin voltage to set the \nPMBus  address. A maximum of 16 addresses \ncan be set by the ADDR pin. Table 7 lists the \nPMBus  address for different resistor values . \nMFR_ADDR_PMBUS (D3h) can be used to \ndigitally set the PMBus  address.  \nFor multi -phase configuration, the slave phases \ncan share the same address as the master  or \nthey can have different addresses, depending on \nthe application requirements. The slave phases \ncan only accept write commands, which means \nthey cannot accept read commands from the \nPMBus master. However, the master phase can \naccep t both write and read commands from the \nPMBus master.  \nStart and Stop Commands  \nStart and stop commands  are signaled by the \nmaster device to indicate  the beginning and the \nend of the PMBus  transfer. A start (S) command  \nis defined as the SDA signal transitioning from \nhigh to low  while SCL is high. A stop (P)  \ncommand  is defined as the SDA  \n \n signal transitioning from low to high  while SCL is \nhigh (see Figure 4 on page 21). \nTable 7: ADDR Resistor  vs. PMBus  Address  \nRADDR (kΩ) Slave Address  \n1.24 30h \n3.74 31h \n6.2 32h \n8.2 33h \n11.3 34h \n13.7 35h \n16.2 36h \n18.7 37h \n21 38h \n24 39h \n26.1 3Ah \n28.7 3Bh \n30.9 3Ch \n33 3Dh \n36 3Eh \n39 3Fh \nThe master then gen erates the SCL clock  \nsignal( s) and transmits the device address and \nthe read/write (R/W) direction bit on the SDA \nline. Data is transferred in 8-bit bytes by  the SDA \nline. Each byte of data must  be followed by an \nacknowledge (ACK) bit.  \nPMBus  Update Sequence  \nThe MPM3695 -100 requires a start command , a \nvalid PMBus  address, a register address byte, \nand a data byte for a single data update. After \nreceiving  each byte, the MPM3695 -100 \nacknowledges this process by pulling the SDA \nline low during the high period of a single clock \npulse. A valid PMBus  address selects the \nMPM3695 -100. The MPM3695 -100 performs an \nupdate on the falling edge of the LSB byte.  \nProtocol  Usage  \nAll PMBus  transactions on the MPM3695 -100 \nare done using defined bus protocols. The \nfollowing protocols can be  implemented : \n\uf0b7 Send byte with packet error checking ( PEC) \n\uf0b7 Receive byte with PEC  \n\uf0b7 Write byte with PEC  \nMPM3695 -100 – 16V, 100A, SCALABLE  DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS  \nMPM3695 -100 Rev. 1.0 MonolithicPower.com  21 \n3/25/2021  MPS Proprietary Information.

The \nACK bit is typically active low ( logic 0) if the \ntransmitted byte is successfully received by a \ndevice. H owever, when the receiving device is \nthe bus master, the ACK bit for the last byte read \nis a logic 1, indicated by  \nA. \nPacket Error Checking (PEC)  \nThe MPM3695 -100’s PMBus  interface supports \nthe use of the packet error checking (PEC) byte. \nThe PEC byte is transmitted by the MPM3695 -\n100 during a read transaction , or sent by the bus \nhost to the MPM3695 -100 during a write \ntransaction.  \nThe PEC byte  detect s errors during a bus \ntransaction, depending on whether the \ntransaction is a read or a write. If the host determines that the PEC byte read during a read \ntransaction is incorrect, it can decide to rep eat \nthe read if necessary. If the MPM3695 -100 \ndetermines that the PEC byte sent during a write \ntransaction is incorrect, it ignores the command \n(does not execute it) and sets a status flag. \nWithin a group command, the host can choose \nto send or not send  a PEC byte as part of the \nmessage to the MPM3695 -100. \nPMBus  Alert Response Address (ARA)  \nThe PMBus  alert response address (ARA) is a \nspecial address that can be used by the bus host \nto locate any devices with which it can \ncommunicate. A host typically uses a hardware \ninterrupt pin to monitor the PMBus  ALERT pins \nfrom a number of devices. When the host \ninterrupt occurs, the host issues a message on \nthe bus using the PMBus  receive byte , or on the \nreceived byte with PEC protocol.  \nThe special address used by the host is 0x0C. \nAny devices that have a PMBus  alert signal \nreturn their own 7 -bit address as the 7MSB of the \ndata byte. The LSB value is not used , and can \nbe either 1 or 0. The host reads the device \naddress from the received data byte and \nproceeds to handle the alert condition.  \nMore than one device may have an active \nPMBus  alert signal an d attempt to communicate \nwith the host. In this case, the device with the \nlowest address dominates the bus and succeeds \nin transmitting its address to the host. The device \nthat succeeds disables its PMBus  alert signal. If \nthe host sees that the PMBus  alert signal is still \nlow, it continues to read addresses until all \ndevices have successfully transmitted their \naddresses.  \n \n \nFigure  4: Data Transfer through the  PMBus\n\nMPM3695 -100 – 16V, 100A, SCALABLE  DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS  \nMPM3695 -100 Rev. 1.0 MonolithicPower.com  22 \n3/25/2021  MPS Proprietary Information.

Patent Protected. Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited.  \n © 2021  MPS. All Rights Reserved.  \nAPPLICATION INFORMATION  \nOperation Mode Selection  \nThe MPM3695 -100 provides both forced \ncontinuous conduction mode  (FCCM) and pulse -\nskip mode (PSM)  for light-load condition s. Four \nswitching frequencies are available under light -\nload condition s. Set the  switching frequency (fSW) \nthrough the PMBus.  \nSetting the Output Voltage  \nTwo feedback resistors are required to set the \nproper feedback gain. The feedback resistor  \nvalues (R 1 and R 2) can be calculated with \nEquation (1):  \n                𝑅2(𝑘Ω)=0.6\n𝑉𝑂𝑈𝑇−0.6×𝑅1(𝑘Ω)             (1) \nWhere V OUT is the output voltage.  \nThe V OUT feedback gain (G FB) can be estimated \nwith Equation (2):  \n                           𝐺𝐹𝐵=𝑅2\n𝑅1+𝑅2                          (2) \nTo optimize the load transient response, a feed -\nforward capacitor (C FF) must  be placed in parallel \nwith R1. Table 6 on page 19 lists the values of \nfeedback resistors and feed -forward capacitors \nfor common output voltages.  \nThe MPM3695 -100 offers V OUT configurability \nthrough the PMBus. In addition, V OUT can be \nadjusted through the PMBus by adjusting the \ninternal reference voltage (V REF) of the PWM \ncontroller.  \nVREF (default  0.6V) can be adjusted to be \nbetween 0.5V and 0.672V. For a given feedback \nresistor network , the maximum output voltage \n(VOUT_MAX ) can be calculated with Equation (3):  \n                           𝑉𝑂𝑈𝑇_𝑀𝐴𝑋=0.672\n𝐺𝐹𝐵                   (3) \nThe minimum output voltage (V OUT_MIN ) can be \nestimated with Equation (4):  \n                             𝑉𝑂𝑈𝑇_𝑀𝐼𝑁=0.5\n𝐺𝐹𝐵                    (4) \nFollow the steps below to configure VOUT through \nthe PMBus:  \n1. Calculate G FB with Equation (2), then write \nthis value to the VOUT_SCALE_LOOP  \nregister . \n 2. Write the V OUT settings to the \nVOUT_COMMAND  register . \n3. VREF is automatically updated based on the \ncommanded V OUT and G FB. \nVOUT monitoring through the PMBus is enabled \nby setting VOUT_SCALE_LOOP to a value that \nmatches G FB.  \nFor applications where the PMBus interface is \nnot required, V REF is 0.6V by default  and the \nMPM3695 -100 operates in analog mode. \nCalculate the feedback resistor values with \nEquation (1).  \nSoft Start  \nThe soft-start time (t SS) can be configured using  \nregister 61h. The minimum tSS is 1ms, but it can \nalso be set to 2ms, 4ms, 8ms, or 16ms.  \nPre-Bias ed Start -Up \nThe MPM3695 -100 is designed for monotonic \nstart-up into pre -biased loads. If VOUT is pre -\nbiased to a certain voltage during start -up, both \nthe HS -FET and LS -FET are disabled until the \ninternal V REF exceeds VFB.  \nOutput Voltage Discharge  \nVOUT discharge mode  is enabled if  the \nMPM3695 -100 is disabled through the CTRL pin. \nIn this case, b oth the high-side and low -side \nswitches latch  off and a  discharge FET \n(connected between SW and GND ) turns on to \ndischarge the output capacitor . A typical \ndischarge  FET on resistance is 60Ω. Once VFB \ndrops below 10%  of VREF, the discharge FET \nturns off. \nCurrent Sense and Over -Current Protection \n(OCP)  \nThe MPM3695 -100 features on -die current \nsens ing and a configurable  inductor valley  \ncurrent limit threshold . The inductor valley over-\ncurrent limit  can be configured  via register D7h, \nwhich sets the per -phase inductor valley current \nlimit for both s ingle - and multi -phase  operation.\nMPM3695 -100 – 16V, 100A, SCALABLE  DC/DC POWER MODULE WITH PMBUS  \nMPM3695 -100 Rev. 1.0 MonolithicPower.com  44 \n3/25/2021  MPS Proprietary Information. Patent Protected. Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited.  \n © 2021  MPS. All Rights Reserved.  \nWhile the LS -FET is on, the inductor  current is \nsensed and m onitored cycle by cycle.  The HS -\nFET does not turn on if an over -current (OC) \ncondition is detected while the LS -FET is on. \nTherefore, the inductor current is also limited \ncycle by cycle. If an OC condition remains for 31 \nconsecutive cycles, OCP is triggered.  \nIf VOUT drops below the u nder-voltage protection \n(UVP) threshold , the MPM3695 -100 enters OCP \nimmediately.  \nOnce OCP is triggered, MPM3695 -100 either \nenters hiccup  mode or latch -off mode , \ndepending on the register setting . To re -enable \nthe device, cycle the power on VCC or CTRL.  \nNegative Inductor Current Limit \nWhen the LS -FET detects a negative current \nbelow the limit (about -13A) , the LS-FET turn s off \nfor a certain period  to limit the negative current.  \nThis period is set by register D5h, bit[3].  \nUnder -Voltage Protection (UVP)  \nThe MPM3695 -100 monitor s VOUT through  the \nVOSNS+  and VOSNS - pins. Under -voltage \nprotection  (UVP) is triggered if VFB drops below \nthe UVP threshold . Once  UVP is triggered, the \nMPM3695 -100 enters either hiccup mode or \nlatch -off mode , depending  on the register \nsetting . To re -enable the device, cycle the power \non VCC or CTRL.   \nOver -Voltage Protection (OVP)  \nOver -voltage protection (OVP) is triggered i f VFB \nexceeds  the OVP threshold . See the  \nMFR_OVP_NOCP_SET (D5h)  section on page \n39 for more details.  \nOutput  Sinking Mode (OSM)  \nThe MPM3695 -100 enters  output sinking mode  \n(OSM) if VOUT exceeds VREF by 5% while \nsimultaneously being below the OVP threshold \nin PSM. Once OSM is triggered, the MPM3695 -\n100 runs in FCCM. The device  exits OSM once  \nthe HS-FET turns back on.  \nOver -Temperature Protection  (OTP)  \nThe MPM3695 -100 monitors the junction \ntemperature. If the junction temperature exceeds \nthe over -temperature protection (OTP) \nthreshold, the MPM3695 -100 enters either \nhiccup  or latch -off mode depending on the PMBus selection . To re -enable the device, cycle \nthe power on VCC or CTRL . \nPower Good (P G) \nThe MPM3695 -100 has an open -drain power  \ngood (PG) output. The PG pin must be pulled \nhigh to VCC  (or a voltage source below 3.6V) \nthrough a pull -up resistor (typically 100kΩ). PG \nis initially pulled low once V IN is applied to the \nMPM3695 -100. After VFB reaches the threshold \nset by POWER_GOOD_ON  and the delay set by \nMFR_CTRL_ VOUT completes , the PG pin  is \npulled high.  \nPG latches low if any fault occurs and a \nprotection is triggered (e.g. UV, OV, OT, UVLO ). \nAfter PG latches off , it can not be pulled high \nagain unless  a new soft start  is initia ted.  \nIf the input supply fails to power the MPM 3695 -\n100, the PG pin latches  off.  \nFigure 5 shows t he relationship between the PG \nvoltage (VPG) and the pull -up current  (IPG).  \n \nFigure 5: Power -Good Current vs. Power  Good \nVoltage  \nSelecting the Input Capacitor  \nThe buck  converter has a  discontinuous  input \ncurrent , and requires a capacitor to supply t he \nAC current to the module  while maintaining the \nDC input voltage.
