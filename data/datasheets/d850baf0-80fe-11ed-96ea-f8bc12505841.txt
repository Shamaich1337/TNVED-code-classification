These \nSMT LEDs have high-reliab ility performance and are \ndesigned to work under a wide range of environmental \nconditions. This high-reliabilit y feature makes them ideally \nsuited to be used under harsh interior automotive as well as interior signs application conditions.\nTo facilitate easy pick-and-pla ce assembly, the LEDs are \npacked in EIA-compliant tape and reel. Every reel is shipped in single intensity and color bin, except red color to provide \nclose uniformity.\nThese LEDs are compatible with IR and TTW solder reflow \nprocess.\nThis super wide viewing angle at 120° together with the \nbuilt-in reflector pushing up the intensity of the light output \nmakes these LED suitable to be used in the interior \nelectronics signs. The flat top emitting surface makes it easy \nfor these LEDs to mate with light  pipes. This is suitable for \ngeneral backlighting in automotive interior, office \nequipment, industrial equipment, and home appliances.

Use hand soldering only for rework if unavoidable, but it must be strictly controlled to  following conditions:\n– Soldering iron tip temperature = 315°C maximum.\n– Soldering duration = 3 seconds maximum.\n– Number of cycles = 1 only.– Power of soldering iron = 50W maximum.\n\uf06eDo not touch the LED package body with the soldering \niron except for the soldering terminals, because it may cause damage to the LED. \n\uf06eConfirm beforehand whether the functionality and performance of the LED is affected by soldering with hand soldering.\nFigure 13:  Recommended Lead-Free Reflow Soldering Profile\nFigure 14:  Recommended Board Reflow DirectionHandling Precautions\nHandling of Moisture-Sensitive Devices\nThis product has a Moisture Sensitive Level 2a rating per \nJEDEC J-STD-020. Refer to Broadcom Application Note \nAN5305, Handling of Moisture S ensitive Surface Mount \nDevices , for additional details and a review of proper \nhandling procedures.\n\uf06eBefore use:\n– An unopened moisture barrier bag (MBB) can be \nstored at <40°C/90% RH for 12 months. If the actual shelf life has exceeded 12 months and the Humidity Indicator Card (HIC) indicates that baking is not required, then it is safe to reflow the LEDs per the \noriginal MSL rating.\n– Do not open the MBB prior to assembly (for \nexample, for IQC). If unavoidable, the MBB must be properly resealed with fres h desiccant and the HIC. \nThe exposed duration must be taken in as floor life.\n\uf06eControl after opening the MBB:\n– Read the HIC immediately upon opening of the \nMBB.\n– Keep the LEDs at <30°/60% RH at all times, and \ncomplete all high temperature-related processes, including solder ing, curing or rework within \n672 hours. \n\uf06eControl for unfinished reel:\nStore unused LEDs in a seal ed MBB with desiccant or a \ndesiccator at <5% RH.\n\uf06eControl of assembled boards:\nIf the PCB soldered with the LEDs is to be subjected to \nother high-temperature processes, store the PCB in a \nsealed MBB with desiccant or  desiccator at <5% RH to \nensure that all LEDs have no t exceeded their floor life of \n672 hours.\n\uf06eBaking is required if:\n– The HIC indicator indicates a change in color for \n10% and 5%, as stated on the HIC.\n– The LEDs are exposed to conditions of >30°C/60% \nRH at any time.\n– The LED's floor life exceeded 672 hours.\nThe recommended baking condition is: 60°C ± 5ºC for \n20 hours.\nBaking can only be done once.\n10 to 30 SE\n6°C/SEC.

If the LEDs  are exposed in an ambient \nenvironment for too long, the silver plating might be \noxidized, thus affecting its solderability perf ormance. As \nsuch, keep unused LEDs in a sealed MBB with \ndesiccant or in a desiccator at <5% RH.\nApplication Precautions\n\uf06eThe drive current of the LED must not exceed the \nmaximum allowable limit acro ss temperature as stated \nin the data sheet. Cons tant current driving is \nrecommended to ensure consistent performance. \n\uf06eCircuit design must cater to the whole range of forward voltage (V\nF) of the LEDs to ensure the intended drive \ncurrent can always be achieved.\n\uf06eThe LED exhibits slightly di fferent characteristics at \ndifferent drive currents, which may result in a larger variation of performance (meaning: intensity, wavelength, and forward voltage). Set the application current as close as possible to the test current to minimize these variations.\n\uf06eDo not use the LED in the vicinity of material with sulfur content or in environments of high gaseous sulfur compounds and corrosive elements. Examples of \nmaterial that might contain sulfur are rubber gaskets, room- temperature vulcaniz ing (RTV) silicone rubber, \nrubber gloves, and so on. Prolonged exposure to such environments may affect the optical characteristics and \nproduct life. \n\uf06eWhite LEDs must not be exposed to acidic environments and must not be used in the vicinity of any compound that may have acidic outgas, such as, but not limited to, acry late adhesive. These \nenvironments have an adverse effect on LED performance.\n\uf06eAvoid rapid change in ambient temperature, especially in high-humidity environm ents, because they cause \ncondensation on the LED.\n\uf06eIf the LED is intended to be used in harsh or outdoor environment, protect the LED against damages caused by rain water, water, dust, oil, corrosive gases, external \nmechanical stresses, and so on.Thermal Management\nOptical, electrical, and reliab ility characteristics of LED are \naffected by temperature. The junction temperature (TJ) of \nthe LED must be kept below allo wable limit at all times. TJ \ncan be calculated as follows:\nTJ = TA + RθJ-A × IF × VFmax \nwhere: \nTA = Ambient temperature (°C)\nRθJ-A = Thermal resistance from LED junction to \nambient (°C/W) \nIF = Forward current (A)\nVFmax = Maximum forward voltage (V)\nThe complication of using this formula lies in TA and RθJ-A. \nActual TA is sometimes subjective and hard to determine. \nRθJ-A varies from system to system depending on design \nand is usually not known.\nAnother way of calculating TJ is by using solder point \ntemperature TS as follows: \nTJ = TS + RθJ-S × IF × VFmax \nwhere:\nTS = LED solder point temperature as shown in the \nfollowing figure (°C)\nRθJ-S = Thermal resistance from junction to solder point \n(°C/W)\nTS can be easily measured by mounting a thermocouple on \nthe soldering joint as shown in preceding figure, while RθJ-S \nis provided in the data sheet. Verify the TS of the LED in the \nfinal product to ensure that th e LEDs are operating within all \nmaximum ratings stated in the data sheet.\n\nHSMx-A2xx-xxxxx Bicolor\nHSMx-A3xx-xxxxx Tricolor  Data Sheet Surface-Mount LED Indicators,\nPLCC-4 SMT LEDs\nBroadcom AV02-0501EN\n16Eye Safety Precautions\nLEDs may pose optical hazards when in operation.
