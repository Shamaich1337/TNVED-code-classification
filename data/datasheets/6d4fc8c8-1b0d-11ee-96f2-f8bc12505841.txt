The \ndevice  operates between 6  GHz and 18 GHz. This LNA provides \n19 dB of small signal gain, 1.6 dB noise figure, and an outp ut \nthird -order intercept ( IP3) of 27 dBm, r equiring only 90  mA of \nsupply current from a 3.5  V supply. The output power for a 1 dB \ncompression  (P1dB ) of 16  dBm e nables the LNA to function as \na local oscill ator ( LO) driver for balanced, I/Q , or image reject ion \nmixers. The HMC903 also features inputs/outputs  that are dc  \nblocked and internally matched to 50  Ω for ease of integration \ninto multichip modules (MCMs). All data is taken w ith the \nHMC903 in a 50 Ω  test fixture connected via 0.025 mm (1 mil) \ndiameter with bonds of 0. 31 mm (12 mil ) length.  \n \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM  \nHMC903\n1RFINVDD1 VDD2\nRFOUT\nVGG2 VGG12 3\n4\n56\n14481-001\n \nFigure 1. \n \nHMC903  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 8  of 13 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe HMC903 is a GaAs , pHEMT, MMIC , low noise amplifier . \nThe HMC903 amplifier uses two gain stages  in series. The basic  \nschematic for the amplifier is shown in Figure 19, which forms  a \nlow noise amplifier  operating from 6 GHz to 18 GHz with excellent \nnoise figure performance.  \nRFIN RFOUTVDD1 VDD2\nVGG1 VGG2\n14481-019 \nFigure 19. Basic Schematic for the HM C903  \nThe HMC903 has single -ended input and output ports with \nimpedances nominally equal to 50 Ω over the 6 GHz to 18 GHz \nfrequency range.  Consequently, the device can be directly inserted  into a 50 Ω  \nsystem with no requir ed impe dance matching circuitry ; therefore , \nmultiple HMC903 amplifiers can be cascaded back to back \nwithout the need for external matching circuitry.  \nThe input and output impedances are sufficiently stable vs. \nvariations in temperature and supply vo ltage that no impedance \nmatching compensation is required.  \nIt is critical to supply very low inductance ground connections \nto the exposed pad to e nsure stable operation. To achieve optimal \nperformance from the  HMC903  and to prevent damage to the \ndevice, do not exceed the absolute maximum ratings . \nData Sheet  HMC903  \n \nRev. C | Page 9  of 13 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nFigure 25 shows the basic connectio ns for operating the HMC903  \nin self biased operation . Both the RFIN an d the RFOUT ports \nhave on -chip dc block capacitors, eliminating the need for \nexternal ac coupling capacitors.  \nThe HMC903 has V GG1 and V GG2 optional gate bias p ads. When \nthese pads are left open, th e amplifier runs in self  biased operation \nwith typical I DQ = 90 mA  when V DD = 3.5 V . When using  the \noptional  VGG1 and V GG2 gate bias p ads, use the recommended \nbias sequencing to  prevent  damage to the amplifier.  \nThe r ecommended bias sequence during p ower -up is as follows:  \n1. Connect to GND .  \n2. Set V GG1 and V GG2 to −2 V. \n3. Set V DD1 and V DD2 to +3.5 V . \n4. Increase V GG1 and V GG2 to achieve a typical I DQ = 90 mA . \n5. Apply the RF signal. \n \n \n The r ecommended bias sequence during p ower -down is as follows:  \n1. Turn off the RF signal.  \n2. Decrease V GG1 and V GG2 to −2 V to achieve a typical I DQ = \n0 mA. \n3. Decrease V DD1 and V DD2 to 0 V . \n4. Increase V GG1 and V GG2 to 0 V . \nThe b ias conditions previously listed (V DD1 and V DD2 = 3.5 V \nand I DQ = 90 mA) are the recommended operating points to \nachieve optimum performance. The data used in this data sheet \nis taken with the recommended bias conditions listed in the  \nElectrical Specifications  section. If the HMC903 is used with \ndifferent bias conditions than what is recommended, a different performance than what is shown  in the  Typical Performance \nCharacteristics  section can result. Dec reasing the V\nDD level has \na negligible effect on gain and NF performance, but r educes \nP1dB. This behavior is shown  in Figure 18. For applications \nwhere the P1dB requirement is not stringent, the HMC903 can \nbe down biased to reduce power consumption.  \n \n \n \nHMC903  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 10 of 13 MOUNTING AND BOND ING TECHNIQUES FOR M ILLIMETERWAVE G aAs MMICS  \nThe HMC903 is attached directly to the ground plane \neutectically o r with conductive epoxy (see the General Handling \nsection , the Mounting  section , and the  Wire Bonding  section ).  \nThe 50 Ω m icrostrip trans mission lines on 0.127 mm (5 mil) \nthick alumina thin film substrates are recommended for \nbringing RF to and from the HMC903 (see Figure 20). When \nusing 0.254 mm (10 m il) thick alumina thin film substrates, the \ndie is raised 0.1 50 mm (6 mil) so the surface of the die is coplanar \nwith the surface of the substrate. One way to accomplish this is \nto attach the 0.102 mm (4 mil) thick die to a 0.150 mm (6 mil) thick molybdenu m heat spreader (moly tab), which then attaches \nto the ground plan e (see Figure 21).  \nRF GROUND PLANE0.102mm (0.004") THICK GaAs MMIC\nWIRE BOND\n0.127mm (0.005") THICK ALUMINA\nTHIN FILM SUBSTRATE0.076mm\n(0.003")\n14481-020 \nFigure 20.

Typical die  to substrate spacing is \n0.076 mm to 0.152 mm (3 mil to 6 mil).  \nHANDLING PRECAUTIONS  \nFollow the  precautions detailed in the following sections to \navoid permanent damage to the device.  \n \n \n \n \n Storage  \nAll bare die are placed in either waffle or gel -based ESD protective  \ncontainers and then sealed in an ESD protective bag for shipment. \nAfter  opening  the sealed ESD protective bag , store all die in a \ndry nitrogen environment.  \nCleanliness  \nHandle the chips in a clean environment. Do not  attempt to \nclean the chip using liquid cleaning systems. \nStatic Sensitivity  \nFollow ESD precautions to protect against E SD strikes.  \nTransients  \nSuppress instrument and bias supply transients while bias is \napplied. Use the shielded signal and bias ca bles to minimize \ninductive pick up. \nGeneral Handling  \nHandle the chip along the edges with a vacuum collet or with a sharp pair of bent tweezers. The surface of the HMC903 has \nfragile air bridges and must not be touched with  the vacuum \ncollet, tweezers, or fingers.  \nMounting  \nThe HMC903 is back metallized and can be die mounted wi th \ngold tin ( AuSn ) eutectic preforms or with electrically \nconductive epoxy. The mounting surface must be clean and flat.  \nEutectic D ie Attach   \nAn 80 % gold/ 20% tin preform is recommended with a work \nsurface temperature of 255 °C and a tool temperature of 265°C. \nWhen hot 90% nitrogen /10% hydrogen gas is applied, the tool \ntip temperature is 290°C. Do not expose the chip to a temperature \ngreater than 320°C for more than 20  sec. No more than 3 sec  of \nscrubbing is required for attachment.  \nEpoxy D ie Attach  \nApply a minimum amount of epoxy to the mounting surface so \nthat a thin epoxy fillet is observed around the perimeter of the \nHMC903 after  it is placed into position. Cure epoxy per the \nschedule of the manufacturer.  \nWire Bonding  \nRF bonds made with two 1 mil wires are recommended. These \nbonds are thermosoni cally bonded with a force of 40 g  to 60 g. \nDC bo nds of 0.001 in (0.025 mm) diameter, thermosonically \nbonded, are recommended. Create ball bonds with a force of 40 g to 50 g  and wedge bond s at 18 g  to 22 g . Create bonds with \na nominal stage temperature of 150°C. A minimum amount of ultrasonic energy is applied to achieve reliable bonds. All bonds are as short as possible, less than 12 mil (0.31 mm).  \n \nData Sheet  HMC903  \n \nRev.

#### Description:
The HMC903 is a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) low noise amplifier (LNA) designed for operation in the frequency range of 6 GHz to 18 GHz. It utilizes gallium arsenide (GaAs) pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (pHEMT) technology, which allows for high performance in terms of gain and low noise figure. The device is self-biased, simplifying its integration into various systems, and it can optionally utilize gate bias control for further optimization of quiescent current.

#### Typical Applications:
The HMC903 is suitable for a variety of applications, including:
- Point-to-point radios
- Point-to-multipoint radios
- Military and space communications
- Test instrumentation

This LNA is particularly useful in systems requiring low noise amplification and high linearity, making it ideal for RF signal processing in communication systems. Its ability to function as a local oscillator (LO) driver for mixers further enhances its versatility in RF applications.
