The circuit designer can take\na significant step toward attaining these goals byimplementing economical circuitry that continuously\nmonitors critical circuit voltages and provides a fault signal\nin the event of an out −of−tolerance condition. The\nMC34161, MC33161 series are universal voltage monitorsintended for use in a wide variety of voltage sensingapplications. The main objectives of this series was toconfigure a device that can be used in as many voltagesensing applications as possible while minimizing cost. The\nflexibility objective is achieved by the utilization of a unique\nMode Select input that is used in conjunction with\ntraditional circuit building blocks. The cost objective isachieved by processing the device on a standard BipolarAnalog flow, and by limiting the package to eight pins. The\ndevice consists of two comparator channels each withhysteresis, a mode select input for channel programming, a\npinned out reference, and two open collector outputs. Eachcomparator channel can be configured as either inverting or\nnoninverting by the Mode Select input. This allows a single\ndevice to perform over, under, and window detection ofpositive and negative voltages. A detailed description ofeach section of the device is given below with therepresentative block diagram shown in Figure 14.\nInput Comparators\nThe input comparators of each channel are identical, each\nhaving an upper threshold voltage of 1.27 V ±2.0% with\n25 mV of hysteresis. The hysteresis is provided to enhanceoutput switching by preventing oscillations as thecomparator thresholds are crossed. The comparators have an\ninput bias current of 60 nA at their threshold which\napproximates a 21.2 M /C0087 resistor to ground. This high\nimpedance minimizes loading of the external voltage\ndivider for well defined trip points. For all positive voltagesensing applications, both comparator channels are fullyfunctional at a V\nCC of 2.0 V . In order to provide enhanced\ndevice ruggedness for hostile industrial environments,additional circuitry was designed into the inputs to preventdevice latchup as well as to suppress electrostatic discharges\n(ESD).Reference\nThe 2.54 V reference is pinned out to provide a means for\nthe input comparators to sense negative voltages, as well as\na means to program the Mode Select input for windowdetection applications. The reference is capable of sourcing\nin excess of 2.0 mA output current and has built −in short\ncircuit protection. The output voltage has a guaranteed\ntolerance of ±2.4% at room temperature.\nThe 2.54 V reference is derived by gaining up the internal\n1.27 V reference by a factor of two. With a power supplyvoltage of 4.0 V , the 2.54 V reference is in full regulation,allowing the device to accurately sense negative voltages.\nMode Select Circuit\nThe key feature that allows this device to be flexible is the\nMode Select input. This input allows the user to programeach of the channels for various types of voltage sensingapplications. Figure 15 shows that the Mode Select input has\nthree defined states. These states determine whetherChannel 1 and/or Channel 2 operate in the inverting or\nnoninverting mode. The Mode Select thresholds are shown\nin Figure 6. The input circuitry forms a tristate switch withthresholds at 0.63 V and V\nref + 0.23 V . The mode select input\ncurrent is 10 /C0109A when connected to the reference output, and\n42 /C0109A when connected to a V CC of 5.0 V , refer to Figure 7.\nOutput Stage\nThe output stage uses a positive feedback base boost\ncircuit for enhanced sink saturation, while maintaining arelatively low device standby current. Figure 11 shows that\nthe sink saturation voltage is about 0.2 V at 8.0 mA overtemperature. By combining the low output saturationcharacteristics with low voltage comparator operation, thisdevice is capable of sensing positive voltages at a V\nCC of\n1.0 V . These characteristics are important in undervoltage\nsensing applications where the output must stay in a lowstate as V\nCC approaches ground. Figure 5 shows the Output\nV oltage versus Supply V oltage in an undervoltage sensingapplication. Note that as V\nCC drops below the programmed\n4.5 V trip point, the output stays in a well defined active lowstate until V\nCC drops below 1.0 V .\nAPPLICATIONS\nThe following circuit figures illustrate the flexibility of\nthis device. Included are voltage sensing applications forover, under, and window detectors, as well as three unique\nconfigurations. Many of the voltage detection circuits are\nshown with the open collector outputs of each channelconnected together driving a light emitting diode (LED).This ‘ORed’ connection is shown for ease of explanationand it is only required for window detection applications.Note that many of the voltage detection circuits are shown\nwith a dashed line output connection. This connection gives\nthe inverse function of the solid line connection. For\nexample, the solid line output connection of Figure 16 has\nthe LED ‘ON’ when input voltage V\nS is above trip voltage\nV2, for overvoltage detection. The dashed line output\nconnection has the LED ‘ON’ when V S is below trip voltage\nV2, for undervoltage detection.\nMC34161, MC33161, NCV33161\nwww. onsemi.com\n8The above figure shows the MC34161 configured as a dual positive overvoltage detector. As the input voltage increases from grou nd, the LED will turn ‘ON’ when\nVS1 or V S2 exceeds V 2. With the dashed line output connection, the circuit becomes a dual positive undervoltage detector. As the input voltage decre ases from\nthe peak towards ground, the LED will turn ‘ON’ when V S1 or V S2 falls below V 1.\nFor known resistor values, the voltage trip points are: For a specific trip voltage, the required resistor ratio is:\nV1/C0043(Vth/C0042VH)/C0466R2\nR1/C00411/C0467 V2/C0043Vth/C0466R2\nR1/C00411/C0467R2\nR1/C0043V1\nVth/C0042VH/C00421R2\nR1/C0043V2\nVth/C00421\nFigure 16.
