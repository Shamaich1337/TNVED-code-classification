Both \ndevices feature an integrated Schottky and a low V CESAT  \nswitch allowing a small converter footprint and lower parts cost. The LT3462 switches at 1.2MHz while the \nLT3462A switches at 2.7MHz. These high speeds enable the use of tiny, low cost and low height capacitors and inductors.\nThe LT3462/ LT3462A operate in a dual inductor inverting \ntopology that filters both the input and output currents. Very low output voltage ripple approaching 1mV\nP‑P can \nbe achieved when ceramic capacitors are used. Fixed fre ‑\nquency switching ensures a clean output free from low \nfrequency noise typically present with charge pump solu ‑\ntions. The 40V switch allows a V IN to V OUT differential of \nup to 38V for dual inductor topologies.\nBoth devices provide a low impedance 1.265V reference \noutput to supply the feedback resistor network. A ground \nreferenced, high impedance FB input allows high feedback \nresistor values without compromising output accuracy.

Block Diagram\nThe LT3462 uses a constant frequency, current mode \ncontrol scheme to provide excellent line and load regula ‑\ntion. Operation can be best understood by referring to the \nBlock Diagram in Figure 1. At the start of each oscillator \ncycle, the SR latch is set, turning on the power switch \nQ1. A voltage proportional to the switch current is added \nto a stabilizing ramp and the resulting sum is fed into \nthe positive terminal of the PWM comparator . When this \nvoltage exceeds the voltage at the output of the EAMP , the \nSR latch is reset, turning off the power switch. The level \nat the output of the EAMP is simply an amplified version of the difference between the feedback voltage and GND. In this manner , the error amplifier sets the correct peak current level to keep the output in regulation. If the error amplifier’s output increases, more current is taken from \nthe output; if it decreases, less current is taken. One func ‑\ntion not shown in Figure 1 is the current limit. The switch \ncurrent is constantly monitored and not allowed to exceed \nthe nominal value of 400mA. If the switch current reaches \n400mA, the SR latch is reset regardless of the output state of the PWM comparator . This current limit cell protects the power switch as well as various external components connected to the LT3462. \nSDREF is a dual function input pin. When driven low it \nshuts the part down, reducing quiescent supply current to less than 10µA. When not driven low, the SDREF pin \nhas an internal pull ‑u p current that turns the regulator on. \nOnce the part is enabled, the SDREF pin sources up to  \n180µA nominally at a fixed voltage of 1.265V through \nexternal resistor R2 to FB.  If there is no fault condition \npresent, FB will regulate to 0V, and V OUT will regulate to  \n1.265V •  (–R1/R2). An optional soft ‑ start circuit uses the \nfixed SDREF pull\n‑\nup current and a capacitor from SDREF \nto VOUT to set the dV/dt on V OUT. In shutdown, an FB bias \ncurrent cancellation circuit supplies up to 150µA biasing current to external resistor R1 while V\nOUT is lower than \nFB. This function eliminates R2 loading of SDREF during shutdown. As a result, supply current in shutdown may exceed 10µA by the amount of current flowing in R1.–\n+\n–+–\n+\n–\n+VOUT VOUTD\nR1 (EXTERNAL)\nR2 (EXTERNAL)FBRAMP\nGENERATORSHUTDOWN\nBIAS CURRENT\nCANCELLATION\n1.2MHz*\nOSCILLATORR\nSQA1\nE AMP\nA2\nCOMPDRIVER\nRC\nCCSW\nQ1\n0.1/uni03A9\nGND\n1.265V\nREFERENCEVINFB\nSDREF\nSDREFSDREF\n3462 F01*LT3462A IS 2.7MHzCS1 (EXTERNAL)\nCS2 (EXTERNAL)\nQ2OFF \uf0ae 3µA\nON \uf0ae 180µAISRC\nSHUTDOWN\nCS1, CS2 OPTIONAL SOFT-START COMPONENTSDO\nLG\nLT3462/LT3462A6\nRev A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInrush Current\nThe LT3462 has a built\n‑\nin Schottky diode. When supply \nvoltage is applied to the V IN pin, the voltage difference \nbetween V IN and V D generates inrush current flowing \nfrom input through the inductor and the Schottky diode \nto charge the flying capacitor to V IN. The maximum non ‑\nrepetitive surge current the Schottky diode in the LT3462  \ncan sustain is 1.5A. The selection of inductor and capaci ‑\ntor value should ensure the peak of the inrush current to be below \n1.5A. The peak inrush current can be calculated \nas follows:\n IP=VIN– 0.6\nL\nC–1exp –π\n2LC–1⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎜⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\n⎟⎟\nwhere L is the inductance between supply and SW , and C \nis the capacitance between SW and D. \nTable 3 gives inrush peak currents for some component \nselections. \nTable 3. Inrush Peak Current\nVIN (V) L (µH) C (µF) IP (A)\n5 22 1 0.70\n5 33 1 0.60\n12 47 1 1.40\nInductor Selection\nEach of the two inductors used with LT3462 should have \na saturation current rating (where inductance is approxi ‑\nmately 70% of zero current inductance ) of approximately \n0.25A or greater . If the device is used in the charge pump \nmode, where there is only one inductor , then its rating \nshould be 0.35A or greater . DCR of the inductors should be less than 1Ω. For LT3462, a value of 22µH is suitable \nif using a coupled inductor such as Sumida CLS62\n‑\n220. \nIf using two separate inductors, increasing the value to 47µH will result in the same ripple current. For LT3462A, \na value of 10µH for the coupled inductor and 22µH for \ntwo inductors will be acceptable for most applications.Capacitor Selection\nCeramic capacitors are recommended. An X7R or X5R \ndielectric should be used to avoid capacitance decreasing \nseverely with applied voltage and at temperature limits. The “flying” capacitor between the SW and D pins should be  a ceramic type of value 1µF or more. When used in \nthe dual inductor or coupled inductor topologies the fly ‑\ning capacitor should have a voltage rating that is more \nthan the difference between the input and output voltages. \nFor the charge pump inverter topology, the voltage rat‑\ning should be more than the output voltage. The output \ncapacitor should be a ceramic type. Acceptable output \ncapacitance varies from 1µF for high V OUT (–36V), to 10µF  \nfor low V OUT (–5V). The input capacitor should be a 1µF \nceramic type and be placed as close as possible to the \nLT3462/LT3462A.\nLayout Hints\nThe high speed operation of the LT3462 demands care ‑\nful attention to board layout. You will not get advertised \nperformance with careless layout. Figure 2 shows the rec ‑\nommended component placement. A ceramic capacitor \nof 1µF or more must be placed close to the IC for input supply bypassing.\nR2\nR1  GND \nC3L1\nL2C1\nVOUTVIN\n+\nC4C2\n3462 F021\n2\n3 456\nFigure 2.
