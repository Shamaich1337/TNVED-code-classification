The component is hermetically sealed, ensuring reliability in various environments.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not specified in the datasheet; however, it is noted that coupling capacitors are required if DC voltage is present at either input or output ports.
- **Current Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; the RF power input is rated at a maximum of 37W at 25°C.
- **Power Consumption:** Maximum RF power input of 37W.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -55°C to +100°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to +100°C.
- **Package Type:** FV1206 (small size).
- **Special Features:**
  - Low cost and small size.
  - 7 sections for improved performance.
  - Excellent power handling capability (up to 7W).
  - Temperature stable due to LTCC construction.
  - Hermetically sealed for enhanced durability.
  - Patent pending technology.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided information.

**Electrical Specifications:**
- **Pass Band Insertion Loss:** 
  - 500-2500 MHz: Max 2.0 dB
  - 600-1700 MHz: Max 1.3 dB
- **Stop Band Rejection Loss:**
  - 230 MHz: Min 40 dB
  - 350 MHz: Min 20 dB
- **Cut-Off Frequency:** 440 MHz with a loss of 3.0 dB.
- **VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio):**
  - 500-1700 MHz: Max 1.5:1
  - 230-350 MHz: Max 20:1

**Typical Applications:**
The HFCN-440+ is commonly used in:
- **Sub-harmonic rejection:** Filtering out unwanted frequencies in RF applications.
- **Transmitters and receivers:** Enhancing signal integrity by allowing higher frequencies to pass while attenuating lower frequencies.
- **Military applications:** Due to its robust construction and reliability in harsh environments.

This high-pass filter is ideal for applications requiring precise frequency management and is particularly useful in communication systems where signal clarity is paramount.
