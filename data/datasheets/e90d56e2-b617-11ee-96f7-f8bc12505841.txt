This device allows a low power or low \nvoltage MCU to interface with heavy machinery, subsystems and other devices through long wires of up to \n1000m, giving any design a reliable and easy to use connection. As any RS422 interface, the AM26C32 works in \na differential voltage range, which enables very good signal integrity.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nInputVCCEQUIVALENT OF A OR B INPUT TYPICAL OF ALL OUTPUTS\nOutputVCCVCC\n1.7 k Ω\nNOM\nGNDGND1.7 k Ω\nNOM17 kΩ\nNOM\n288 k Ω\nNOM\nVCC(A inputs)\nor\nGND (B inputs)Input\nGNDEQUIVALENT OF G OR G INPUT\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 ±7-V Common-Mode Range With ±200-mV Sensitivity\nFor a common-mode voltage varying from -7V to 7V, the input voltage is acceptable in low ranges greater than \n200 mV as a standard.\n7.3.2 Input Fail-Safe Circuitry\nRS-485 specifies that the receiver output state should be logic high for differential input voltages of V AB ≥ +200 \nmV and logic low for V AB ≤ –200 mV. For input voltages in between these limits, a receiver’s output state is \nnot defined and can randomly assume high or low. Removing the uncertainty of random output states, modern \ntransceiver designs include internal biasing circuits that put the receiver output into a defined state (typically \nhigh) in the absence of a valid input signal.\nA loss of input signal can be caused by an pen circuit caused by a wire break or the unintentional disconnection \nof a transceiver from the bus. The AM26C32 has an internal circuit that ensures functionality during an idle bus.\n7.3.3 Active-High and Active-Low\nThe device can be configure using the G and G logic inputs to select receiver output. The high voltage or logic 1 \non the G pin, allows the device to operate on an active-high and having a low voltage or logic 0 on the G enables \nactive low operation. These are simply a way to configure the logic to match that of the receiving or transmitting \ncontroller or microprocessor.\n7.3.4 Operates from a Single 5-V Supply\nBoth the logic and receivers operate from a single 5-V rail, making designs much more simple. The line drivers \nand receivers can operate off the same rail as the host controller or a similar low voltage supply, thus simplifying \npower structure.AM26C32, AM26C32C, AM26C32M, AM26C32I\nSLLS104M – DECEMBER 1990 – REVISED OCTOBER 2023\n www.ti.com\n8 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: AM26C32  AM26C32C  AM26C32M  AM26C32I\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Enable and Disable\nThe receivers implemented in these RS422 devices can be configured using the G and G pins to be enabled or \ndisabled.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nWhen designing a system that uses drivers, receivers, and transceivers that comply with RS-422 or RS-485, \nproper cable termination is essential for highly reliable applications with reduced reflections in the transmission \nline. Because RS-422 allows only one driver on the bus, if termination is used, it is placed only at the end \nof the cable near the last receiver. In general, RS-485 requires termination at both ends of the cable. Factors \nto consider when determining the type of termination usually are performance requirements of the application \nand the ever-present factor, cost. The different types of termination techniques discussed are unterminated \nlines, parallel termination, AC termination, and multipoint termination. Laboratory waveforms for each termination \ntechnique (except multipoint termination) illustrate the usefulness and robustness of RS-422 (and, indirectly, \nRS-485). Similar results can be obtained if 485-compliant devices and termination techniques are used. For \nlaboratory experiments, 100 feet of 100- Ω, 24-AWG, twisted-pair cable (Bertek) was used. A single driver and \nreceiver, TI AM26C31C and AM26C32C, respectively, were tested at room temperature with a 5-V supply \nvoltage. Two plots per termination technique are shown. In each plot, the top waveform is the driver input and \nthe bottom waveform is the receiver output. To show voltage waveforms related to transmission-line reflections, \nthe first plot shows output waveforms from the driver at the start of the cable; the second plot shows input \nwaveforms to the receiver at the far end of the cable.\n8.2 Typical Application\nDINDAM26C31\n(One Driver)\nDRTAM26C32\n(One Receiver)\nROUT\nFigure 8-1. Differential Terminated Configuration\n8.2.1 Design Requirements\nResistor and capacitor (if used) termination values are shown for each laboratory experiment, but vary \nfrom system to system. For example, the termination resistor, R T, must be within 20% of the characteristic \nimpedance, Zo , of the cable and can vary from about 80 Ω to 120 Ω.\n8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nFigure 8-1  shows a configuration with no termination. Although reflections are present at the receiver inputs \nat a data signaling rate of 200 kbps with no termination, the RS-422-compliant receiver reads only the input \ndifferential voltage and produces a clean signal at the output.AM26C32, AM26C32C, AM26C32M, AM26C32I\nSLLS104M – DECEMBER 1990 – REVISED OCTOBER 2023\n www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: AM26C32  AM26C32C  AM26C32M  AM26C32I\n8.2.3 Application Curve\n±3 ±2 ±1 012345\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5Voltage (V) \nTime (\x1ds) Y A/B\nC001 \nFigure 8-2. Differential 120-Ω Terminated Output Waveforms (Cat 5E Cable)\n8.3 Power Supply Recommendations\nPlace 0.1- μF bypass capacitors close to the power-supply pins to reduce errors coupling in from noisy or high \nimpedance power supplies.\n8.4 Layout\n8.4.1 Layout Guidelines\nFor best operational performance of the device, use good PCB layout practices, including:\n•Noise can propagate into analog circuitry through the power pins of the circuit as a whole, as well as the \noperational amplifier. Bypass capacitors are used to reduce the coupled noise by providing low impedance \npower sources local to the analog circuitry.\n–Connect low-ESR, 0.1-μF ceramic bypass capacitors between each supply pin and ground, placed as \nclose to the device as possible. A single bypass capacitor from V+ to ground is applicable for single \nsupply applications.\n•Separate grounding for analog and digital portions of circuitry is one of the simplest and most-effective \nmethods of noise suppression. One or more layers on multilayer PCBs are usually devoted to ground planes. \nA ground plane helps distribute heat and reduces EMI noise pickup. Make sure to physically separate digital \nand analog grounds, paying attention to the flow of the ground current.\n•To reduce parasitic coupling, run the input traces as far away from the supply or output traces as possible. If it \nis not possible to keep them separate, it is much better to cross the sensitive trace perpendicular as opposed \nto in parallel with the noisy trace.\n•Place the external components as close to the device as possible. Keeping RF and RG close to the inverting \ninput minimizes parasitic capacitance.\n•Keep the length of input traces as short as possible. Always remember that the input traces are the most \nsensitive part of the circuit.\n•Consider a driven, low-impedance guard ring around the critical traces. A guard ring can significantly reduce \nleakage currents from nearby traces that are at different potentials.\nwww.ti.comAM26C32, AM26C32C, AM26C32M, AM26C32I\nSLLS104M – DECEMBER 1990 – REVISED OCTOBER 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: AM26C32  AM26C32C  AM26C32M  AM26C32I\n8.4.2 Layout Example\nAM26C321\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n91B\n1A\n1Y\nG\n2Y\n2A\n2B\nGNDVCC\n4B\n4A\n4Y\nG\n3Y\n3A\n3B0.1µFVDD\nTermination Resistor\nReduce logic signal trace \nwhen possible\nFigure 8-3.
