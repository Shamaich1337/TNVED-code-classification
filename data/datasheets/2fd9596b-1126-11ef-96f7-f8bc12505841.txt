Application  \nThe LEDs described here are intended to be used for  ordinary electronic equipment (such as office \nequipment, communication equipment and household ap plications).Consult Liteon’s Sales in advance \nfor information on applications in which exceptiona l reliability is required, particularly when the fa ilure \nor malfunction of the LEDs may directly jeopardize life or health (such as in aviation, transportation , \ntraffic control equipment, medical and life support  systems and safety devices).  \n2. Storage \nThe package is sealed:  \n  The LEDs should be stored at 30°C or less and 90% RH or less. And the LEDs are limited to use within \none year, while the LEDs is packed in moisture-proo f package with the desiccants inside. \nThe package is opened: \nThe storage ambient for the LEDs should not exceed 30°C temperature or 60% relative humidity. \nIt is recommended that LEDs out of their original p ackaging are IR-reflowed within one week. \nFor extended storage out of their original packagin g, it is recommended that the LEDs be stored in a \nsealed container with appropriate desiccant, or in a desiccators with nitrogen ambient.  \nLEDs stored out of their original packaging for mor e than one week should be baked at about 60 deg C \nfor at least 20 hours before solder assembly.  \n3. Cleaning \nUse alcohol-based cleaning solvents such as isoprop yl alcohol to clean the LED if necessary.  \n4.

In order to en sure intensity uniformity on multiple LEDs connecte d \nin parallel in an application, it is recommended th at a current limiting resistor be incorporated in t he \ndrive circuit, in series with each LED as shown in Circuit A below. \n Circuit model A                      Circuit model B  \n          LED \n                LED \n \n(A) Recommended circuit. \n(B) The brightness of each LED might appear differe nt due to the differences in the I-V characteristic s \nof those LEDs.  \n6. ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) \nStatic Electricity or power surge will damage the L ED.  \nSuggestions to prevent ESD damage:  \n\x01 Use of a conductive wrist band or anti-electrostati c glove when handling these LEDs. \n\x01 All devices, equipment, and machinery must be prope rly grounded. \n\x01 Work tables, storage racks, etc. should be properly  grounded. \n\x01 Use ion blower to neutralize the static charge whic h might have built up on surface of the LED’s \nplastic lens as a result of friction between LEDs d uring storage and handling. \n \nESD-damaged LEDs will exhibit abnormal characterist ics such as high reverse leakage current, low forwa rd \nvoltage, or “ no lightup ” at low currents. \nTo verify for ESD damage, check for “ lightup ” and  Vf of the suspect LEDs at low currents. \nThe Vf of “ good ” LEDs should be >2.0V@0.1mA for I nGaN product and >1.4V@0.1mA for AlInGaP product.     \n LITE-ON  TECHNOLOGY  CORPORATION \nSamLi20120117 \nProperty of Lite-On Only \n \n \n7.
