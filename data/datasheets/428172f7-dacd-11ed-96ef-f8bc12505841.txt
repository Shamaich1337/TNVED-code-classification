Because LVPECL (Positive ECL),\nLVDS, and positive CML input levels and LVTTL/LVCMOS outputlevels are used, only +3.3 V and ground are required. The small\noutline 8−lead SOIC package makes the EPT21 ideal for applications\nwhich require the translation of a clock or data signal.\nThe V\nBB output allows this EPT21 to be cap coupled in either\nsingle−ended or differential input mode. When single −ended cap\ncoupled, V BB output is tied to the D  input and D is driven for a\nnon−inverting buffer, or V BB output is tied to the D input and D  is\ndriven for an inverting buffer. When cap coupled differentially, V BB\noutput is connected through a resistor to each input pin. If used, theV\nBB pin should be bypassed to V CC via a 0.01 /C0109F capacitor. For\nadditional information see AND8020/D. For a single −ended direct\nconnection use an external voltage reference source such as a resistor\ndivider. Do not use V BB for a single −ended direct connection or port to\nanother device.\nFeatures\n•1.4 ns Typical Propagation Delay\n•Maximum Frequency > 275 MHz Typical\n•LVPECL/LVDS/CML Inputs, LVTTL/LVCMOS Outputs\n•24 mA TTL outputs\n•Operating Range: V CC = 3.0 V to 3.6 V with GND = 0 V\n•The 100 Series Contains Temperature Compensation\n•VBB Output\n•These Devices are Pb −Free and are RoHS CompliantMARKING\nDIAGRAMS*\nA = Assembly Location\nL = Wafer LotY = YearW = Work Week\nM = Date Code/C0071= Pb−Free PackageKA21\nALYW /C0071\n/C0071SO−8\nD SUFFIX\nCASE 751\nTSSOP−8\nDT SUFFIX\nCASE 948R\n18\n18http://onsemi.com\n*For additional marking information, refer to \nApplication Note AND8002/D.\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information in the package\ndimensions sect ion on page 6 of this data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATIONKPT21\nALYW\n/C0071\n18\n18\nDFN8\nMN SUFFIX\nCASE 506AA\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)3RM/C0071\n/C00711\nMC100EPT21\nhttp://onsemi.com\n21\n2\n3\n45678\nQ\nGNDVCC\nFigure 1.

### Component Summary: MC100EPT21DG

**Description:**
The MC100EPT21 is a Differential LVPECL/LVDS/CML to LVTTL/LVCMOS translator. It is designed to convert differential input signals from LVPECL, LVDS, or CML levels to LVTTL or LVCMOS output levels, operating with a single +3.3 V power supply. This component is particularly useful in applications requiring the translation of clock or data signals.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - VCC (Power Supply): 3.0 V to 3.6 V (absolute maximum 3.8 V)
  - Input Voltage (VIN): 0 to 3.8 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Current (IOH): 24 mA (TTL outputs)
  - VBB Sink/Source: ±0.5 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Power Supply Current (ICCH): 5 to 25 mA (outputs HIGH)
  - Power Supply Current (ICCL): 8 to 30 mA (outputs LOW)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - TA: -40 °C to +85 °C
  - Tstg (Storage Temperature): -65 °C to +150 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - Available in SOIC-8, TSSOP-8, and DFN8 packages.

- **Special Features:**
  - 1.4 ns typical propagation delay.
  - Maximum frequency > 275 MHz.
  - VBB output for reference voltage.
  - Pb-Free and RoHS compliant.
  - Temperature compensation included in the 100 Series.

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (JEDEC J-STD-020E):**
  - SOIC-8: Level 1
  - TSSOP-8: Level 3
  - DFN8: Level 1

### Typical Applications:
The MC100EPT21 is commonly used in high-speed data communication applications, including:

- **Clock Distribution:** Translating clock signals between different logic levels.
- **Data Signal Translation:** Converting data signals from high-speed differential signaling formats (LVPECL, LVDS, CML) to standard TTL or CMOS levels for interfacing with other digital circuits.
- **High-Speed Interfaces:** Used in systems requiring low skew and high-frequency operation, such as telecommunications and networking equipment.

This component is ideal for applications where signal integrity and speed are critical, making it suitable for modern digital communication systems.
