This pin is open -drain driven \nand may  be wire -ORed with any number of other \nopen -drain or open -collector devices.  \nDEVICE/PAG E ADDRESSES (A2 , A1, A0): The A2, \nA1 and A0 pins are device address inputs that are \nhardwired  or left not connected for hardware \ncompatibility with other FM24CXX devices.  When \nthe pins are hardwired, a s many as eight  256K  \ndevices may be addressed on a sing le bus system  \n(device addressing is discussed in detail under the \nDevice  Addressing section).  If the pins are left \nfloating, the A2, A1 and A0 pins will be internally pulled down to GND if the capacitive coupling to \nthe circuit board V CC plane is <3pF, if coupling \nis >3pF, FMSH recommends connecting the \naddress pins to GND.  \nWRITE PROTECT (WP): The FM24C256E  has a \nWrite Protect pin that provides hardware data \nprotection. The WP pin allows normal write operations  \nwhen connected to ground (GND). When the Write  \nProtect pin is connected to VCC, all write operations \nto the memory are inhibited. If the pin is left floating, \nthe WP pin will be internally pulled down to GND if \nthe capacitive coupling to the circuit board Vcc plane \nis <3pF. If coupling is >3pF, FMSH r ecommends \nconnecting the WP to GND. Switching WP to VCC \nprior to a write operation creates a software write \nprotected function.  \nWrite Protect Description   \nWP Pin  Status  Part of the Memory  Protected   \nWP= VCC Full Memory  Protected  \nWP= GND  No Protected  \n \nMem ory Organization  \nFM24C256E , 256K  SERIAL EEPROM:  Internally organized with 512 pages of 64 bytes each,  the 256K \nrequires a  15-bit data word address for random word addressing.  \nSecurity Sector: The FM24C256E  offers  64-byte Security Sectors which can be writt en and (later) \npermanently locked in Read -only mode.

Data on \nthe SDA  pin may change only during SCL low time \nperiods (refer to  Figure 4 ). Data changes during \nSCL high periods will indicate a start or stop \ncondition as defined below.  \nSTART CONDITION: A high -to-low transition of SDA \nwith SCL high is a start condition which must \nprecede any other command (refer to Figure 5 ). \nSTOP CONDITION: A low -to-high transition of SDA \nwith SCL high is a stop condition. After a read \nsequence, the  stop command will place the EEPROM  \nin a standby power  mode (refer to Figure 5). \nACKNOWLEDGE: All address and data words are \nserially transmitted to and from the EEPROM in 8 -bit words. The EEPROM sends a zero during the ninth \nclock cycle  to acknowledge that it has received \neach word.   \nSTANDBY MODE: The FM24C256E  features  a \nlow-powe r standby mode which is enabled: (a) \nupon power -up and (b) after the receipt of the stop \nbit and the  completion of any internal operations.  \nMemory  RESET : After an interruption in protocol, \npower loss or system  reset, any 2-wire part can be  \nreset in follow ing these steps : \n1. Clock up to 9 Cycles,  \n2. Look for SDA high in each cycle while SCL is \nhigh and then,  \n3.

This is common \nto all the EEPROM devices.  \nThe 256K  EEPROM uses the three device address \nbits A2, A1, A0 to allow as many as eight devices on \nthe same bus. These bits must compare to their \ncorresponding hard -wired input pins. The A2, A1 \nand A0 pins use an int ernal proprietary circuit that \nbiases them to a logic low condition if the pins are \nallowed to float.  \nThe Module package  device address word also \nconsists of a mandatory „1010 ‟(Ah) sequence for \nthe first four most significant bits. The next 3 bits \nare all  zero. \nThe eighth bit of the device address is the \nread/write operation select bit. A read operation is \ninitiated if this bit is high and a write operation is \ninitiated if this bit is low.  \nUpon a compare of the device address, the \nEEPROM will output a zero . If a compare is not \nmade, the device  will return to a standby state.  \nUnique ID  Access:  The FM24C256E  utilizes a \nseparate  memory block containing a factory \nprogrammed 128-bit unique ID . Access to this \nmemory location is obtained by beginning the \ndevice ad dress  word with a „1011‟(Bh) sequence  \n(refer to Table 1 ). The behavior of the next three \nbits (A2, A1  and A0) remain s the same as during a  \nstandard memory addressing sequence.  \nThe eighth bit of the device address needs be set to \na one to read the Serial Nu mber. Writing  or altering \nthe 128 -bit unique ID  is not possible.  For more details on accessing this special feature,  \nSee Read Operations on page 1 5. \nSecurity Sector  Access: The FM24C256E  offers  \n64-byte Security Sector  which can be written and \n(later) perma nently locked in Read -only mode.  Access \nto this memory location is obtained by beginning the \ndevice address  word with a „1011‟(Bh) sequence  (refer \nto Table 1 ). The behavior of the next three bits (A2, A1  \nand A0) remain s the same as during a  standard memory  \naddressing sequence.  \nThe eighth bit of the device address is the read/write \noperation select bit. A read operation is initiated if this \nbit is high and a write operation is initiated if this bit is \nlow. \nFor more details on accessing this special feature, See \nWrite Operations and Read Operations on page 1 4,15. \nECC Error Status Register  Access : The FM24C256E  \noffers  1-bit ECC  Error Status  Register  (EESR)  to \nindicate  whether  there is a single error bit in a group \nof four bytes  during a Read operation . Access t o \nEESR  is obtained by beginning the device address  word \nwith a „1011‟(Bh) sequence  (refer to Table 1 ). The \nbehavior of the next three bits (A2, A1  and A0) remain s \nthe same as during a  standard memory addressing \nsequence.  \nThe eighth bit of the device addres s needs be set to a \none to read the  EESR .  \nFor more details on accessing this special feature, See \nWrite Operations and Read Operations on page 1 4,15. \nNOISE PROTECTION: Special internal circuitry \nplaced on the SDA and SCL pins prevent small noise \nspikes fr om activating the device.  \nDATA SECURITY: The Device  has a hardware data \nprotection scheme that allows the user to write protect \nthe entire memory when the WP pin is at V CC. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 256E 2-Wire Serial EEPROM                    V1.0                                       13 Table  1．Device Address   \n \nAccess Area  Bit7 Bit6 Bit5 Bit4 Bit3 Bit2 Bit1 Bit0 \nData Memory  1 0 1 0 A2 A1 A0 R/W \nSecurity Sector  1 0 1 1 A2 A1 A0 R/W \nSecurity Sector Lock Bit  1 0 1 1 A2 A1 A0 R/W \nUnique ID Number  1 0 1 1 A2 A1 A0 1 \nEcc Error status Register  1 0 1 1 A2 A1 A0 1 \n MSB       LSB \n \nTable 2．First Word Addres s \n \nAccess Area  Bit7 Bit6 Bit5 Bit4 Bit3 Bit2 Bit1 Bit0 \nData Memory  x A14 A13 A12 A11 A10 A9 A8 \nSecurity Sector  x x x x x 0 0 x \nSecurity Sector Lock Bit  x x x x x 1 0 X \nUnique ID Number  x x x x x 0 1 x \nEcc Error status Register  x x x x x 1 1 x \n MSB       LSB \nNOTE: x = Don `t care bit . \n \nTable 3．Second Word Address  \n \nAccess Area  Bit7 Bit6 Bit5 Bit4 Bit3 Bit2 Bit1 Bit0 \nData Memory  A7 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 \nSecurity Sector  x x A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 \nSecurity Sector Lock Bit  x x x x x x x x \nUnique ID Number  x x x x 0 0 0 0 \nEcc Error status Register  x x x x x x x x \n MSB       LSB \nNOTE: x = Don `t care bit . \n \n \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 256E 2-Wire Serial EEPROM                    V1.0                                       14 Write  Operations  \nBYTE WRITE: A write operation requires two 8-bit \ndata word address following the device address \nword and acknowledgment. Upon receipt of this \naddress, the EEPROM will again respo nd with a \nzero and then clock in the first 8 -bit data word. \nFollowing receipt of the 8 -bit data word, the \nEEPROM will output a zero and the addressing \ndevice, such as a microcontroller, must terminate \nthe write sequence with a stop condition. At this \ntime the EEPROM enters an internally -timed write \ncycle, tWR, to the nonvolatile memory. All inputs are \ndisabled during this write cycle and the EEPROM \nwill not respond until the write is complete ( see \nFigure 7 on page 1 6). \n \nPAGE WRITE: The 256K  EEPROM is capabl e of \n64-byte page write s. A page write is initiated the \nsame  way as a byte write, but the microcontroller \ndoes not send a stop condition after the first data \nword is clocked in. Instead, after the EEPROM  \nacknowledges receipt of the first data word, the \nmicrocontroller can transmit up to 63 more data \nwords. The EEPROM will respond with a zero after \neach data word received. The microcontroller must \nterminate the page write sequence with a stop \ncondition ( see Figure 8 on page 1 6). \nThe data word address lower seven  bits are \ninternally incremented following the receipt of each \ndata word. The higher data word address bits are \nnot incremented, retaining the memory page row \nlocation. When the word address, internally \ngenerated, reaches the page boundary, the \nfollowi ng byte is placed at the beginning of the \nsame page. If more than 64 data words are \ntransmitted to the EEPROM, the data word address \nwill “roll over” and previous data will be overwritten.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGE POLLING: Once the internally \ntimed write cycle has started and the EEPROM \ninputs are disabled, acknowledge polling can be \ninitiated. This involves sending a start condition \nfollowed by the device address word. The \nread/write bit is representative of the operation \ndesired. Only if the internal write cycle has \ncompleted will the EEPROM respond with a zero \nallowing the read or write sequence to continue.  \n \n \n \n WRITE  SECURITY SECTOR : Write the Security \nSector  is similar to the page write but requires use \nof device address , and the special word address \nseen in Table 1~3 on page 1 3. The higher address \nbits A DDR< 14:6> are don‟t care except for address \nbits A DDR<10: 9>，which must be equal to „00b‟. \nLower address bits A DDR< 5:0> define the byte \naddress inside the Security Sector  (see Figure 12 \non page 1 8). \nIf the Security Sector  is locked, the data bytes \ntransferred during the Write Security Sector  \noperation  are not ackno wledged (NoAck).   \nLOCK SECURITY SECTOR : Lock the Security \nSector  is similar to the byte write but requires use of \ndevice address , and special word address  seen in \nTable 1 ~3 on page 1 3. The word address bits \nADDR<10:9>  must be „10b‟, all other  word  address \nbits are don ‟t care.  The data byte must be equal to \nthe binary value xxxx xx1x, where x is don't care  \n(see Figure 14 on page 1 9). \nIf the Security Sector  is locked, the data bytes \ntransferred during the Lock Security Sector  \noperation are not acknowledged (N oAck).   \nCycling with Error Correction Code (ECC) : \nThe FM24C256E offer an Error Correction Code \n(ECC) logic. The ECC is an internal logic function \nwhich is transparent for the 2-wire Serial  \ncommunication protocol.  The ECC logic is \nimplemented on each group(1) of four EEPROM \nbytes. Inside a group, if a single bit out of the four \nbytes happens to be erroneous during a Read \noperation, the ECC detects this bit and replaces it \nwith the correct value. The read reliability is \ntherefore much improved.  Even if the EC C function \nis performed on groups of four bytes, a single byte \ncan be written/cycled independently. In this case, \nthe ECC function also writes/cycles the three other \nbytes located in the same group(1). As a \nconsequence, the maximum cycling budget is \ndefine d at group level and the cycling can be \ndistributed over the four bytes of the group: the sum \nof the cycles seen by byte0, byte1, byte2 and byte3 \nof the same group must remain below the maximum \nvalue defined in Section Cycling Performance By \nGroups Of Four Bytes on Page 6 . \nNote： \n1. A group of four bytes is located at addresses [4*N, \n4*N+1, 4*N+2, 4*N+3], where N is an integer.  \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 256E 2-Wire Serial EEPROM                    V1.0                                       15 Read Operati ons\nRead operations are initiated the same way as write \noperations with the exception that the read/write select \nbit in the device address word is set to one.  \nCURRENT ADDRESS READ: The internal data word \naddress counter maintains the last address accessed \nduring the last read or write operation, incremented by \none. This address stays valid between operations as \nlong as th e chip power is maintained. The address “roll \nover” during read is from the last byte of the last \nmemory page to the first byte of the first page. The \naddress “roll over” during write is from the last byte of \nthe current page to the first byte of the same page.  \nOnce the device address with the read/write select bit \nset to one is clocked in and acknowledged by the \nEEPROM, the current address data word is serially \nclocked out. The microcontroller does not respond with \nan input zero but does generate a followi ng stop \ncondition ( see Figure 9 on page 1 7). \nRANDOM READ: A random read requires a “dummy” \nbyte write sequence to load in the data word address. \nOnce the device address word and data word address \nare clocked in and acknowledged by the EEPROM, \nthe microcont roller must generate another start \ncondition. The microcontroller now initiates a current \naddress read by sending a device address with the \nread/write select bit high. The EEPROM \nacknowledges the device address and serially clocks \nout the data word. The mi crocontroller does not \nrespond with a zero but does generate a following stop \ncondition ( see Figure 10 on page 1 7). \nSEQUENTIAL READ: Sequential reads are initiated \nby either a current address read or a random address \nread. After the microcontroller receive s a data word, it \nresponds with an acknowledge. As long as the \nEEPROM receives an  acknowledge, it will continue to \nincrement the data word address and serially clock out \nsequential data words. When the memory address \nlimit is reached, the data word address  will “roll over” \nand the sequential read will continue. The sequential \nread operation is terminated when the microcontroller \ndoes not respond with a zero but does generate a \nfollowing stop condition ( see Figure 11 on page 1 7) \nUNIQUE ID  READ : Reading the s erial number is \nsimilar to the sequential read but requires use of the  \ndevice address, a dummy write, and the use of specific \nword address  seen in Table 1 ~3 on page 1 3. The \nhigher address bits A DDR< 14:4> are don ‟t care except \nfor address bits ADDR<10:9> ，which must be equal to \n„01b‟. Lower address bits A DDR<3:0> define the byte \naddress inside the  UID. If the application desires to read the first byte of the UID, the lower address bits \nADDR<3:0> would need to be „0000b ‟.  \nWhen the end of the 128 -bit UID numbe r is reached \n(16 bytes of data), the data word address will roll -over \nback to the  beginning of the 128 -bit UID number . The \nUnique ID  Read operation is terminated when the \nmicrocontroller does  not respond with a  zero (ACK) \nand instead issues a Stop conditio n (see Figure 16 on \npage 20). \nREAD SECURITY SECTOR ：Read the Security \nSector  is similar to the random read but requires use o f \ndevice address , a dummy write, and the use of specific \nword address  seen in Table 1 ~3 on page 1 3. The \nhigher  address bits ADDR< 14:6> are don ‟t care except \nfor address bits ADDR<10:9> ，which must be equal to \n„00b‟. The lower  address bits ADDR< 5:0> define the \nbyte address inside the Security Sector .  \nThe internal byte address is automatically incremented \nto the next byte address after e ach byte of data is \nclocked  out. When  the last byte ( 3Fh) is reached, it will \nroll over to 00h, the first byte of the Security Sector , \nand continue to increment.  (see Figure 13 on page \n18). \nREAD LOCK STATUS ：There are  two ways to check \nthe lock status of th e Security Sector . \n1. The first way is initiat ed by a Security Sector  Write , \nthe EEPROM  will acknowledge  if the Security Sector  is \nunlocked, while it will not acknowledge  if the Security \nSector  is locked.  \nOnce the acknowledge bit is read, it is recommended  \nto generate a Start  condition followed by a Stop \ncondition, so that:  \n\uf06c Start: the truncated command is not executed \nbecause the Start condition resets the  device \ninternal logic  \n\uf06c Stop: the device is then set back into Standby \nmode by the Stop condition.  \n2. The second way is initiated  by a Lock Status Read . \nLock Status Read  is similar to the random read but \nrequires use o f device address seen in Table 1 ~3 on \npage 1 3, a dummy write, and the use of specific word \naddress. The a ddress bit s ADDR<10:9>  must be „10b‟, \nall other address bits are  Don't Care. The Lock bit is \nthe BIT1 of the byte read on SDA. It is at “1” when the \nlock is active and at “0” when the lock is not active.  \nThe same data is shifted out repeatedly until the \nmicrocontroller does not respond with a  zero but does \ngenerate a following stop condition  (see Figure 15 on \npage 1 9).\n  \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 256E 2-Wire Serial EEPROM                    V1.0                                       16 READ ECC ERROR STATUS REGISTER: Due to the \nECC is an internal logic function which is \ntransparent  for the 2-wire Serial communication \nprotocol , the microcontroller  will not find out if there \nis a single error bit issue during Read operation. The \ndevice offers  1-bit volatile  ECC Error Status \nRegister  (EESR)  to find whether  there are  error bits \nafter a Read operation.  \nReading the EESR  bit is similar to the random read but \nrequir es use of device address seen in Table 1~3  on \npage 1 3, a dummy write, and the use of specific word \naddress. The a ddress bit s ADDR<10:9>  must be „1 1b‟, \nall other address bits are  Don't Care. The EESR  is \nindicated  by the whole byte read on SDA. It is at “ FFh” \nwhen there are one or more error bits  and at “ 00h” \nwhen the group of four bytes all correct . The same data is shifted out repeatedly until the microcontroller \ndoes not respond with a zero but does generate a \nfollowing stop condition (see Figure 17 on pag e 20). \nIf the users want to find the group address contains \nthe error bit , according to the following steps : \n\uf06c Start reading from the address of the user \nconcerned.  The Read operation must by group  \naddress , and then following the Read EESR \noperation.  If curr ent group address is no error, \nthen reading the next group address.  \n\uf06c Reading by group address and Read EESR \noperation  must be executed  alternately until the \nerror group address is found.  \n\uf06c The EESR bit will be reset to „0b‟ at the end of \neach Read EESR  operat ion. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7．Byte Write  \n \n \nM\nS\nBL\nS\nBA\nC\nKA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nP WORD
