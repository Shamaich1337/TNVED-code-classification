Benefits include more density in less space, high-speed interface device, and sup-\nport for code and data storage. Features include high-performance synchronous-burst\nread mode, fast asynchronous access times, low power, flexible security options, and\nthree industry-standard package choices. The product family is manufactured using Mi-\ncron 65nm process technology.\nThe NOR Flash device provides high performance at low voltage on a 16-bit data bus.\nIndividually erasable memory blocks are sized for optimum code and data storage.\nUpon initial power up or return from reset, the device defaults to asynchronous page-\nmode read. Configuring the read configuration register enables synchronous burst-\nmode reads. In synchronous burst mode, output data is synchronized with a user-sup-\nplied clock signal. A WAIT signal provides easy CPU-to-flash memory synchronization.\nIn addition to the enhanced architecture and interface, the device incorporates technol-\nogy that enables fast factory PROGRAM and ERASE operations. Designed for low-volt-\nage systems, the devIce supports READ operations with V CC at the low voltages, and\nERASE and PROGRAM operations with V PP at the low voltages or V PPH. Buffered en-\nhanced factory programming (BEFP) provides the fastest Flash array programming per-\nformance with V PP at V PPH, which increases factory throughput. With V PP at low voltag-\nes, V CC and V PP can be tied together for a simple, ultra low-power design. In addition to\nvoltage flexibility, a dedicated V PP connection provides complete data protection when\nVPP ≤ VPPLK .\nA command user interface is the interface between the system processor and all inter-\nnal operations of the device. The device automatically executes the algorithms and tim-\nings necessary for block erase and program. A status register indicates ERASE or PRO-\nGRAM completion and any errors that may have occurred.\nAn industry-standard command sequence invokes program and erase automation.\nEach ERASE operation erases one block. The erase suspend feature enables system soft-\nware to pause an ERASE cycle to read or program data in another block. Program sus-\npend enables system software to pause programming to read other locations. Data is\nprogrammed in word increments (16 bits).\nThe protection register enables unique device identification that can be used to in-\ncrease system security. The individual block lock feature provides zero-latency block\nlocking and unlocking. The device includes enhanced protection via password access;\nthis new feature supports write and/or read access protection of user-defined blocks. In\naddition, the device also provides the full-device OTP security feature.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nGeneral Description\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

The maximum address bit is\nthen used to select between the die pair with CE# asserted.

During synchronous READ operations, addresses are\nlatched on the rising edge of ADV#, or on the next valid CLK edge with ADV# LOW, which-\never occurs first. In asynchronous mode, the address is latched when ADV# goes HIGH or\ncontinuously flows through if ADV# is held LOW.\nNote: Designs not using ADV# must tie it to V SS to allow addresses to flow through.\nCE# Input Chip enable:  Active LOW input. CE# LOW selects the associated die. When asserted, inter-\nnal control logic, input buffers, decoders, and sense amplifiers are active. When de-asser-\nted, the associated die is deselected, power is reduced to standby levels, data and wait\noutputs are placed in High-Z.\nNote: CE# must be driven HIGH when device is not in use.\nCLK Input Clock:  Synchronizes the device with the system bus frequency in synchronous-read mode.\nDuring synchronous READs, addresses are latched on the rising edge of ADV#, or on the\nnext valid CLK edge with ADV# LOW, whichever occurs first.\nNote: Designs not using CLK for synchronous read mode must tie it to V CCQ or V SS.\nOE# Input Output enable:  Active LOW input. OE# LOW enables the device’s output data buffers\nduring READ cycles. OE# HIGH places the data outputs and WAIT in High-Z.\nRST# Input Reset:  Active LOW input. RST# resets internal automation and inhibits WRITE operations.\nThis provides data protection during power transitions. RST# HIGH enables normal opera-\ntion. Exit from reset places the device in asynchronous read array mode.\nWP# Input Write protect: Active LOW input. WP# LOW enables the lock-down mechanism. Blocks in\nlock-down cannot be unlocked with the Unlock command. WP# HIGH overrides the lock-\ndown function enabling blocks to be erased or programmed using software commands.\nNote: Designs not using WP# for protection could tie it to V CCQ or V SS without additional\ncapacitor.\nWE# Input Write enable:  Active LOW input. WE# controls writes to the device. Address and data are\nlatched on the rising edge of WE# or CE#, whichever occurs first.\nVPP Power/Input Erase and program power:  A valid voltage on this pin allows erasing or programming.\nMemory contents cannot be altered when V PP ≤ VPPLK. Block erase and program at invalid\nVPP voltages should not be attempted. \nSet V PP = V PPL for in-system PROGRAM and ERASE operations. To accommodate resistor or\ndiode drops from the system supply, the V IH level of V PP can be as low as V PPL,min . VPP must\nremain above V PPL,min  to perform in-system modification. V PP may be 0V during READ op-\nerations.\nVPP can be connected to 9V for a cumulative total not to exceed 80 hours. Extended use of\nthis pin at 9V may reduce block cycling capability.\nDQ[15:0] Input/Output Data input/output:  Inputs data and commands during WRITE cycles; outputs data during\nmemory, status register, protection register, and read configuration register reads. Data\nballs float when the CE# or OE# are de-asserted. Data is internally latched during writes.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nSignal Descriptions\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

ADV# LOW opens the internal ad-\ndress latches. OE# LOW activates the outputs and gates selected data onto the I/O bus.\nBus cycles to/from the device conform to standard microprocessor bus operations. Bus\noperations and the logic levels that must be applied to the device control signal inputs\nare shown here.\nTable 5: Bus Operations\nBus Operation RST# CLK ADV# CE# OE# WE# WAIT DQ[15:0] Notes\nREAD Asynchronous H X L L L H De-asserted Output -\nSynchronous H Running L L L H Driven Output -\nWRITE H X L L H L High-Z Input 1\nOUTPUT DISABLE H X X L H H High-Z High-Z 2\nSTANDBY H X X H X X High-Z High-Z 2\nRESET L X X X X X High-Z High-Z 2, 3\nNotes: 1.

RST# must be at V SS ±0.2V to meet the maximum specified power-down current.\nRead\nTo perform a READ operation, RST# and WE# must be de-asserted while CE# and OE#\nare asserted. CE# is the device-select control. When asserted, it enables the device. OE#\nis the data-output control. When asserted, the addressed flash memory data is driven\nonto the I/O bus.\nWrite\nTo perform a WRITE operation, both CE# and WE# are asserted while RST# and OE# are\nde-asserted. During a WRITE operation, address and data are latched on the rising edge\nof WE# or CE#, whichever occurs first. The Command Bus Cycles table shows the bus\ncycle sequence for each of the supported device commands, while the Command Codes\nand Definitions table describes each command.\nNote:  WRITE operations with invalid V CC and/or V PP voltages can produce spurious re-\nsults and should not be attempted.\nOutput Disable\nWhen OE# is de-asserted, device outputs DQ[15:0] are disabled and placed in High-Z\nstate, WAIT is also placed in High-Z.\nStandby\nWhen CE# is de-asserted the device is deselected and placed in standby, substantially\nreducing power consumption.

All rights reserved.\nured over any 5ms time interval, 5μs after CE# is de-asserted. During standby, average\ncurrent is measured over the same time interval 5μs after CE# is de-asserted.\nWhen the device is deselected (while CE# is de-asserted) during a PROGRAM or ERASE\noperation, it continues to consume active power until the PROGRAM or ERASE opera-\ntion is completed.\nReset\nAs with any automated device, it is important to assert RST# when the system is reset.\nWhen the system comes out of reset, the system processor attempts to read from the\ndevice if it is the system boot device. If a CPU reset occurs with no device reset, improp-\ner CPU initialization may occur because the device may be providing status informa-\ntion rather than array data. Micron devices enable proper CPU initialization following a\nsystem reset through the use of the RST# input. RST# should be controlled by the same\nlow-true reset signal that resets the system CPU.\nAfter initial power-up or reset, the device defaults to asynchronous read array mode,\nand the status register is set to 0x80. Asserting RST# de-energizes all internal circuits,\nand places the output drivers in High-Z. When RST# is asserted, the device shuts down\nthe operation in progress, a process which takes a minimum amount of time to com-\nplete. When RST# has been de-asserted, the device is reset to asynchronous read array\nstate.\nWhen device returns from a reset (RST# de-asserted), a minimum wait is required be-\nfore the initial read access outputs valid data. Also, a minimum delay is required after a\nreset before a write cycle can be initiated. After this wake-up interval passes, normal op-\neration is restored.\nNote:  If RST# is asserted during a PROGRAM or ERASE operation, the operation is ter-\nminated and the memory contents at the aborted location (for a program) or block (for\nan erase) are no longer valid, because the data may have been only partially written or\nerased.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nBus Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

The device manages all block-erase and word-program\nalgorithms.\nDevice commands are written to the CUI to control all device operations. The CUI does\nnot occupy an addressable memory location; it is the mechanism through which the\ndevice is controlled.\nNote: For a dual device, all setup commands should be re-issued to the device when a\ndifferent die is selected.\nTable 6: Command Codes and Definitions\nMode Device Mode Code Description\nRead Read array 0xFF Places the device in read array mode. Array data is output on DQ[15:0].\nRead status register 0x70 Places the device in read status register mode. The device enters this\nmode after a PROGRAM or ERASE command is issued. Status register\ndata is output on DQ[7:0].\nRead device ID \nor read configura-\ntion register0x90 Places device in read device identifier mode. Subsequent reads output\nmanufacturer/device codes, configuration register data, block lock sta-\ntus, or protection register data on DQ[15:0].\nRead CFI 0x98 Places the device in read CFI mode. Subsequent reads output CFI infor-\nmation on DQ[7:0].\nClear status register 0x50 The device sets status register error bits. The clear status register com-\nmand is used to clear the SR error bits.\nWrite Word program setup 0x40 First cycle of a 2-cycle programming command; prepares the CUI for a\nWRITE operation. On the next write cycle, the address and data are\nlatched and the device executes the programming algorithm at the ad-\ndressed location. During PROGRAM operations, the device responds\nonly to READ STATUS REGISTER and PROGRAM SUSPEND commands.\nCE# or OE# must be toggled to update the status register in asynchro-\nnous read. CE# or ADV# must be toggled to update the status register\ndata for synchronous non-array reads. The READ ARRAY command\nmust be issued to read array data after programming has finished.\nBuffered program 0xE8 This command loads a variable number of words up to the buffer size\nof 512 words onto the program buffer.\nBuffered program\nconfirm0xD0 The CONFIRM command is issued after the data streaming for writing\ninto the buffer is completed. The device then performs the buffered\nprogram algorithm, writing the data from the buffer to the memory\narray.\nBEFP setup 0x80 First cycle of a two-cycle command; initiates buffered enhanced factory\nprogram mode (BEFP). The CUI then waits for the BEFP CONFIRM com-\nmand, 0xD0, that initiates the BEFP algorithm. All other commands are\nignored when BEFP mode begins.\nBEFP confirm 0xD0 If the previous command was BEFP SETUP (0x80), the CUI latches the\naddress and data, and prepares the device for BEFP mode.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nDevice Command Codes\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

The device performs the erase algorithm on the\nblock addressed by the ERASE CONFIRM command. If the next com-\nmand is not  the ERASE CONFIRM (0xD0) command, the CUI sets status\nregister bits SR4 and SR5, and places the device in read status register\nmode.\nBlock erase confirm 0xD0 If the first command was BLOCK ERASE SETUP (0x20), the CUI latches\nthe address and data, and the device erases the addressed block. Dur-\ning BLOCK ERASE operations, the device responds only to READ STATUS\nREGISTER and ERASE SUSPEND commands. CE# or OE# must be toggled\nto update the status register in asynchronous read. CE# or ADV# must\nbe toggled to update the status register data for synchronous non-ar-\nray reads.\nSuspend Program or erase\nsuspend0xB0 This command issued to any device address initiates a suspend of the\ncurrently-executing program or BLOCK ERASE operation. The status\nregister indicates successful suspend operation by setting either SR2\n(program suspended) or SR6 (erase suspended), along with SR7 (ready).\nThe device remains in the suspend mode regardless of control signal\nstates (except for RST# asserted).\nSuspend resume 0xD0 This command issued to any device address resumes the suspended\nPROGRAM or BLOCK ERASE operation.\nProtection Block lock setup 0x60 First cycle of a two-cycle command; prepares the CUI for block lock con-\nfiguration changes. If the next command is not BLOCK LOCK (0x01),\nBLOCK UNLOCK (0xD0), or BLOCK LOCK DOWN (0x2F), the CUI sets sta-\ntus register bits SR5 and SR4, indicating a command sequence error.\nBlock lock 0x01 If the previous command was BLOCK LOCK SETUP (0x60), the addressed\nblock is locked.\nBlock unlock 0xD0 If the previous command was BLOCK LOCK SETUP (0x60), the addressed\nblock is unlocked. If the addressed block is in a lock down state, the op-\neration has no effect.\nBlock lock down 0x2F If the previous command was BLOCK LOCK SETUP (0x60), the addressed\nblock is locked down.\nOTP register or lock\nregister program set-\nup0xC0 First cycle of a two-cycle command; prepares the device for a OTP REG-\nISTER or LOCK REGISTER PROGRAM operation. The second cycle latches\nthe register address and data, and starts the programming algorithm\nto program data the OTP array.\nConfiguration Read configuration\nregister setup0x60 First cycle of a two-cycle command; prepares the CUI for device read\nconfiguration. If the SET READ CONFIGURATION REGISTER command\n(0x03) is not the next command, the CUI sets status register bits SR4\nand SR5, indicating a command sequence error.\nRead configuration\nregister0x03 If the previous command was READ CONFIGURATION REGISTER SETUP\n(0x60), the CUI latches the address and writes A[16:1] to the read con-\nfiguration register for Easy BGA and TSOP, A[15:0] for QUAD+.

Several commands are used to modify array data including WORD\nPROGRAM and BLOCK ERASE commands. Writing either command to the CUI initiates\na sequence of internally timed functions that culminate in the completion of the re-\nquested task. However, the operation can be aborted by either asserting RST# or by is-\nsuing an appropriate suspend command.\nTable 7: Command Bus Cycles\nMode CommandBus\nCyclesFirst Bus Cycle Second Bus Cycle\nOp Addr1Data2Op Addr1Data2\nRead READ ARRAY 1 WRITE DnA 0xFF – – –\nREAD DEVICE IDENTIFIER ≥2 WRITE DnA 0x90 READ DBA + IA ID\nREAD CFI ≥2 WRITE DnA 0x98 READ DBA + CFI-A CFI-D\nREAD STATUS REGISTER 2 WRITE DnA 0x70 READ DnA SRD\nCLEAR STATUS REGISTER 1 WRITE DnA 0x50 – – –\nProgram WORD PROGRAM 2 WRITE WA 0x40 WRITE WA WD\nBUFFERED PROGRAM3>2 WRITE WA 0xE8 WRITE WA N - 1\nBUFFERED ENHANCED\nFACTORY PROGRAM\n(BEFP)4>2 WRITE WA 0x80 WRITE WA 0xD0\nErase BLOCK ERASE 2 WRITE BA 0x20 WRITE BA 0xD0\nSuspend PROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND 1 WRITE DnA 0xB0 – – –\nPROGRAM/ERASE RESUME 1 WRITE DnA 0xD0 – – –\nProtection BLOCK LOCK 2 WRITE BA 0x60 WRITE BA 0x01\nBLOCK UNLOCK 2 WRITE BA 0x60 WRITE BA 0xD0\nBLOCK LOCK DOWN 2 WRITE BA 0x60 WRITE BA 0x2F\nPROGRAM OTP REGISTER 2 WRITE PRA 0xC0 WRITE OTP-RA OTP-D\nPROGRAM LOCK REGISTER 2 WRITE LRA 0xC0 WRITE LRA LRD\nConfiguration CONFIGURE READ\nCONFIGURATION REGISTER2 WRITE RCD 0x60 WRITE RCD 0x03\nBlank Check BLOCK BLANK CHECK 2 WRITE BA 0xBC WRITE BA D0\nEFI EXTENDED FUNCTION\nINTERFACE 5>2 WRITE WA 0xEB Write WA Sub-Op code\nNotes: 1.

All rights reserved.\nRead Operations\nThe device supports two read modes: asynchronous page mode and synchronous burst\nmode. Asynchronous page mode is the default read mode after device power-up or a re-\nset. Under asynchronous page mode, the device can also perform single word read. The\nread configuration register must be configured to enable synchronous burst reads of the\narray.\nThe device can be in any of four read states: read array, read identifier, read status, or\nread CFI. Upon power-up, or after a reset, the device defaults to read array. To change\nthe read state, the appropriate READ command must be written to the device.\nAsynchronous Single Word Read\nTo perform an asynchronous single word read, an address is driven onto the address\nbus, and CE# is asserted.\nNote:  To perform an asynchronous single word read for a TSOP package, ADV# must be\nLOW throughout the READ cycle. For an Easy BGA package, ADV# can be driven HIGH\nto latch the address or be held LOW throughout the READ cycle.\nWE# and RST# must already have been de-asserted. WAIT is set to a de-asserted state\nduring single word mode, as determined by bit 10 of the read configuration register.\nCLK is not used for asynchronous single word reads, and is ignored. If asynchronous\nreads are to be performed only, CLK should be tied to a valid V IH or V SS level, WAIT can\nbe floated, and ADV# must be tied to ground. After OE# is asserted, the data is driven\nonto DQ[15:0] after an initial access time tAVQV or tGLQV delay.\nAsynchronous Page Mode Read (Easy BGA Only)\nNote:  Asynchronous Page Mode Read is supported only in the main array.\nFollowing a device power-up or reset, asynchronous page mode is the default read\nmode and the device is set to read array. However, to perform array reads after any other\ndevice operation (WRITE operation), the READ ARRAY command must be issued in or-\nder to read from the array.\nAsynchronous page mode reads can only be performed when read configuration regis-\nter bit RCR15 is set.\nTo perform an asynchronous page-mode read, an address is driven onto the address\nbus, and CE# and ADV# are asserted. WE# and RST# must already have been de-asser-\nted. WAIT is de-asserted during asynchronous page mode. ADV# can be driven HIGH to\nlatch the address, or it must be held LOW throughout the READ cycle. CLK is not used\nfor asynchronous page mode reads, and is ignored. If only asynchronous reads are to be\nperformed, CLK should be tied to a valid V IH or V SS level, WAIT signal can be floated,\nand ADV# must be tied to ground. Array data is driven onto DQ[15:0] after an initial ac-\ncess time tAVQV delay.\nIn asynchronous page mode, 16 data words are “sensed” simultaneously from the array\nand loaded into an internal page buffer. The buffer word corresponding to the initial\naddress on the address bus is driven onto DQ[15:0] after the initial access delay. The\nlowest four address bits determine which word of the 16-word page is output from the\ndata buffer at any given time.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nRead Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev. D 5/17 EN 24Micron Technology, Inc. reserves the right to change products or specifications without notice.\n© 2013 Micron Technology, Inc. All rights reserved.\nSynchronous Burst Mode Read (Easy BGA Only)\nRead configuration register bits RCR[15:0] must be set before synchronous burst opera-\ntion can be performed. Synchronous burst mode can be performed for both array and\nnon-array reads such as read ID, read status, or read query.\nTo perform a synchronous burst read, an initial address is driven onto the address bus,\nand CE# and ADV# are asserted. WE# and RST# must already have been de-asserted.\nADV# is asserted, and then de-asserted to latch the address. Alternately, ADV# can re-\nmain asserted throughout the burst access, in which case the address is latched on the\nnext valid CLK edge while ADV# is asserted.\nDuring synchronous array and non-array read modes, the first word is output from the\ndata buffer on the next valid CLK edge after the initial access latency delay. Subsequent\ndata is output on valid CLK edges following a minimum delay. However, for a synchro-\nnous non-array read, the same word of data will be output on successive clock edges\nuntil the burst length requirements are satisfied. Refer to the timing diagrams for more\ndetailed information.\nRead CFI\nThe READ CFI command instructs the device to output CFI data when read. See Com-\nmon Flash Interface for details on issuing the READ CFI command, and for details on\naddresses and offsets within the CFI database.\nRead Device ID\nThe READ DEVICE IDENTIFIER command instructs the device to output manufacturer\ncode, device identifier code, block lock status, protection register data, or configuration\nregister data.\nTable 8: Device ID Information\nItem Address Data\nManufacturer code 0x00 0x89\nDevice ID code 0x01 ID (see the Device ID Codes table )\nBlock lock configuration\nBlock is unlocked\nBlock is locked\nBlock is not locked down\nBlock is locked downBlock base address + 0x02 Lock bit\nDQ0 = 0b0\nDQ0 = 0b1\nDQ1 = 0b0\nDQ1 = 0b1\nRead configuration register 0x05 RCR contents\nGeneral purpose register Device base address + 0x07 General purpose register data\nLock register 0 0x80 PR-LK0 data\n64-bit factory-programmed OTP register 0x81–0x84 Factory OTP register data\n64-bit user-programmable OTP register 0x85–0x88 User OTP register data\nLock register 1 0x89 PR-LK1 OTP register lock data\n128-bit user-programmable protection regis-\nters0x8A–0x109 OTP register data512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nSynchronous Burst Mode Read (Easy BGA Only)\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nProgram Operations\nSuccessful programming requires the addressed block to be unlocked. If the block is\nlocked down, WP# must be de-asserted and the block must be unlocked before at-\ntempting to program the block. Attempting to program a locked block causes a program\nerror (SR4 and SR1 set) and termination of the operation. See Security Modes for details\non locking and unlocking blocks.\nWord Programming (40h)\nWord programming operations are initiated by writing the WORD PROGRAM SETUP\ncommand to the device (see the Command Codes and Definitions table). This is fol-\nlowed by a second write to the device with the address and data to be programmed. The\ndevice outputs status register data when read (see the Word Program Flowchart). V PP\nmust be above V PPLK , and within the specified V PPL MIN/MAX values.\nDuring programming, the device executes a sequence of internally-timed events that\nprogram the desired data bits at the addressed location, and verifies that the bits are\nsufficiently programmed. Programming the array changes 1s to 0s. Memory array bits\nthat are 0s can be changed to 1s only by erasing the block (see Erase Operations).\nThe status register can be examined for programming progress and errors by reading at\nany address. The device remains in the read status register state until another com-\nmand is written to the device.\nSR7 indicates the programming status while the sequence executes. Commands that\ncan be issued to the device during programming are PROGRAM SUSPEND, READ STA-\nTUS REGISTER, READ DEVICE IDENTIFIER, READ CFI, and READ ARRAY (this returns\nunknown data).\nWhen programming has finished, SR4 (when set) indicates a programming failure. If\nSR3 is set, the device could not perform the WORD PROGRAMMING operation because\nVPP was outside of its acceptable limits. If SR1 is set, the WORD PROGRAMMING opera-\ntion attempted to program a locked block, causing the operation to abort.\nBefore issuing a new command, the status register contents should be examined and\nthen cleared using the CLEAR STATUS REGISTER command. Any valid command can\nfollow, when word programming has completed.\nBuffered Programming (E8h, D0h)\nThe device features a 512-word buffer to enable optimum programming performance.\nFor buffered programming, data is first written to an on-chip write buffer. Then the buf-\nfer data is programmed into the array in buffer-size increments. This can improve sys-\ntem programming performance significantly over non-buffered programming.\nWhen the BUFFERED PROGRAMMING SETUP command is issued, status register in-\nformation is updated and reflects the availability of the buffer. SR7 indicates buffer\navailability: if set, the buffer is available; if cleared, the buffer is not available.\nNote:  The device default state is to output SR data after the BUFFERED PROGRAM-\nMING SETUP command. CE# and OE# LOW drive device to update status register. It is\nnot allowed to issue 70h to read SR data after E8h command; otherwise, 70h would be\ncounted as word count.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nProgram Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev. D 5/17 EN 27Micron Technology, Inc. reserves the right to change products or specifications without notice.\n© 2013 Micron Technology, Inc. All rights reserved.\nOn the next write, a word count is written to the device at the buffer address. This tells\nthe device how many data words will be written to the buffer, up to the maximum size\nof the buffer.\nOn the next write, a device start address is given along with the first data to be written to\nthe flash memory array. Subsequent writes provide additional device addresses and da-\nta. All data addresses must lie within the start address plus the word count. Optimum\nprogramming performance and lower power usage are obtained by aligning the starting\naddress at the beginning of a 512-word boundary (A[9:1] = 0x00 for Easy BGA and TSOP ,\nA[8:0] for QUAD+ package; see Part Numbering Information). The maximum buffer size\nwould be 256-word if the misaligned address range is crossing a 512-word boundary\nduring programming.\nAfter the last data is written to the buffer, the BUFFERED PROGRAMMING CONFIRM\ncommand must be issued to the original block address. The device begins to program\nbuffer contents to the array. If a command other than the BUFFERED PROGRAMMING\nCONFIRM command is written to the device, a command sequence error occurs and\nSR[7,5,4] are set. If an error occurs while writing to the array, the device stops program-\nming, and SR[7,4] are set, indicating a programming failure.\nWhen buffered programming has completed, additional buffer writes can be initiated\nby issuing another BUFFERED PROGRAMMING SETUP command and repeating the\nbuffered program sequence. Buffered programming may be performed with V PP = V PPL\nor V PPH (see Operating Conditions for limitations when operating the device with V PP =\nVPPH).\nIf an attempt is made to program past an erase-block boundary using the BUFFERED\nPROGRAM command, the device aborts the operation. This generates a command se-\nquence error, and SR[5,4] are set.\nIf buffered programming is attempted while V PP is at or below V PPLK , SR[4,3] are set. If\nany errors are detected that have set status register bits, the status register should be\ncleared using the CLEAR STATUS REGISTER command.\nBuffered Enhanced Factory Programming (80h, D0h)\nBuffered enhanced factory programming (BEFP) speeds up multilevel cell (MLC) pro-\ngramming. The enhanced programming algorithm used in BEFP eliminates traditional\nprogramming elements that drive up overhead in device programmer systems.\nBEFP consists of three phases: setup, program/verify, and exit (see the BEFP Flowchart).\nIt uses a write buffer to spread MLC program performance across 512 data words. Verifi-\ncation occurs in the same phase as programming to accurately program the cell to the\ncorrect bit state.\nA single two-cycle command sequence programs the entire block of data. This en-\nhancement eliminates three write cycles per buffer: two commands and the word count\nfor each set of 512 data words. Host programmer bus cycles fill the device write buffer\nfollowed by a status check. SR0 indicates when data from the buffer has been program-\nmed into sequential array locations.\nFollowing the buffer-to-flash array programming sequence, the device increments in-\nternal addressing to automatically select the next 512-word array boundary. This aspect\nof BEFP saves host programming equipment the address bus setup overhead.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nProgram Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev. D 5/17 EN 28Micron Technology, Inc. reserves the right to change products or specifications without notice.\n© 2013 Micron Technology, Inc. All rights reserved.\nWith adequate continuity testing, programming equipment can rely on the device’s in-\nternal verification to ensure that the device has programmed properly. This eliminates\nthe external post-program verification and its associated overhead.\nTable 10: BEFP Requirements\nParameter/Issue Requirement Notes\nCase temperature TC = 30°C ±10°C  \nVCC Nominal V CC  \nVPP Driven to V PPH  \nSetup and confirm Target block must be unlocked before issuing the BEFP Setup and Confirm commands.  \nProgramming The first-word address (WA0) of the block to be programmed must be held constant\nfrom the setup phase through all data streaming into the target block, until transition\nto the exit phase is desired. \nBuffer alignment WA0 must align with the start of an array buffer boundary. 1\nNote: 1. Word buffer boundaries in the array are determined by the lowest 9 address bits (0x000\nthrough 0x1FF). The alignment start point is 0x000.\nTable 11: BEFP Considerations\nParameter/Issue Requirement Notes\nCycling For optimum performance, cycling must be limited below 50 ERASE cycles per block. 1\nProgramming blocks BEFP programs one block at a time; all buffer data must fall within a single block. 2\nSuspend BEFP cannot be suspended.  \nProgramming the ar-\nrayProgramming to the array can occur only when the buffer is full. 3\nNotes: 1. Some degradation in performance may occur if this limit is exceeded, but the internal\nalgorithm continues to work properly.\n2. If the internal address counter increments beyond the block\'s maximum address, ad-\ndressing wraps around to the beginning of the block.\n3. If the number of words is less than 512, remaining locations must be filled with 0xFFFF.\nBEFP Setup Phase:  After receiving the BEFP SETUP and CONFIRM command se-\nquence, SR7 (ready) is cleared, indicating that the device is busy with BEFP algorithm\nstartup. A delay before checking SR7 is required to allow the device enough time to per-\nform all of its setups and checks (block lock status, V PP level, etc.). If an error is detected,\nSR4 is set and BEFP operation terminates. If the block was found to be locked, SR1 is\nalso set. SR3 is set if the error occurred due to an incorrect V PP level.\nNote: Reading from the device after the BEFP SETUP and CONFIRM command se-\nquence outputs status register data. Do not issue the READ STATUS REGISTER com-\nmand; it will be interpreted as data to be loaded into the buffer.\nBEFP Program/Verify Phase:  After the BEFP setup phase has completed, the host pro-\ngramming system must check SR[7,0] to determine the availability of the write buffer\nfor data streaming. SR7 cleared indicates the device is busy and the BEFP program/veri-\nfy phase is activated. SR0 indicates the write buffer is available.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nProgram Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nTwo basic sequences repeat in this phase: loading of the write buffer, followed by buffer\ndata programming to the array. For BEFP , the count value for buffer loading is always\nthe maximum buffer size of 512 words. During the buffer-loading sequence, data is stor-\ned to sequential buffer locations starting at address 0x00. Programming of the buffer\ncontents to the array starts as soon as the buffer is full. If the number of words is less\nthan 512, the remaining buffer locations must be filled with 0xFFFF .\nNote: The buffer must be completely filled for programming to occur. Supplying an ad-\ndress outside of the current block\'s range during a buffer-fill sequence causes the algo-\nrithm to exit immediately. Any data previously loaded into the buffer during the fill cy-\ncle is not programmed into the array.\nThe starting address for data entry must be buffer size aligned; if not, the BEFP algo-\nrithm will be aborted, the program fails, and the (SR4) flag will be set.\nData words from the write buffer are directed to sequential memory locations in the ar-\nray; programming continues from where the previous buffer sequence ended. The host\nprogramming system must poll SR0 to determine when the buffer program sequence\ncompletes. SR0 cleared indicates that all buffer data has been transferred to the array;\nSR0 set indicates that the buffer is not available yet for the next fill cycle. The host sys-\ntem may check full status for errors at any time, but it is only necessary on a block basis\nafter BEFP exit. After the buffer fill cycle, no WRITE cycles should be issued to the de-\nvice until SR0 = 0 and the device is ready for the next buffer fill.\nNote: Any spurious writes are ignored after a BUFFER FILL operation and when internal\nprogram is proceeding.\nThe host programming system continues the BEFP algorithm by providing the next\ngroup of data words to be written to the buffer. Alternatively, it can terminate this phase\nby changing the block address to one outside of the current block’s range.\nThe program/verify phase concludes when the programmer writes to a different block\naddress; data supplied must be 0xFFFF . Upon program/verify phase completion, the de-\nvice enters the BEFP exit phase.\nProgram Suspend\nIssuing the PROGRAM SUSPEND command while programming suspends the pro-\ngramming operation. This allows data to be accessed from the device other than the\none being programmed. The PROGRAM SUSPEND command can be issued to any de-\nvice address. A PROGRAM operation can be suspended to perform reads only. Addition-\nally, a PROGRAM operation that is running during an erase suspend can be suspended\nto perform a READ operation.\nWhen a programming operation is executing, issuing the PROGRAM SUSPEND com-\nmand requests the device to suspend the programming algorithm at predetermined\npoints. The device continues to output status register data after the PROGRAM SUS-\nPEND command is issued. Programming is suspended when SR[7,2] are set.\nTo read data from the device, the READ ARRAY command must be issued. READ ARRAY,\nREAD STATUS REGISTER, READ DEVICE IDENTIFIER, READ CFI, and PROGRAM RE-\nSUME valid commands during a program suspend.\nDuring a program suspend, de-asserting CE# places the device in standby, reducing ac-\ntive current. V PP must remain at its programming level, and WP# must remain un-\nchanged while in program suspend. If RST# is asserted, the device is reset.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nProgram Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nProgram Resume\nThe RESUME command instructs the device to continue programming, and automati-\ncally clears SR[7,2]. This command can be written to any address. If error bits are set,\nthe status register should be cleared before issuing the next command. RST# must re-\nmain de-asserted.\nProgram Protection\nWhen V PP = V IL, absolute hardware write protection is provided for all device blocks. If\nVPP is at or below V PPLK , programming operations halt and SR3 is set, indicating a V PP-\nlevel error. Block lock registers are not affected by the voltage level on V PP; they may still\nbe programmed and read, even if V PP is less than V PPLK .\nFigure 8: Example V PP Supply Connections\nVCC\nVPPVCC\nVPP\n10K Ω <\n-Factory programming with VPP = VPPH\n-Complete with program/erase\n  protection when V <PP VPPLK\nVCCVCC\nVPP\n-Low voltage programming only\n-Full device protection unavailable-Low voltage programming only\n-Logic control of device protectionVCC\nPROT#VCC\nVPP\n-Low voltage and factory programmingVCC\nVPPVCC\nVPPVPPH=512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nProgram Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nErase Operations\nBLOCK ERASE Command\nERASE operations are performed on a block basis. An entire block is erased each time a\nBLOCK ERASE command sequence is issued, and only one block is erased at a time.\nWhen a block is erased, each bit within that block reads as a logical 1.\nA BLOCK ERASE operation is initiated by writing the BLOCK ERASE SETUP command\nto the address of the block to be erased, followed by the BLOCK ERASE CONFIRM com-\nmand. If the device is placed in standby (CE# de-asserted) during a BLOCK ERASE oper-\nation, the device completes the operation before entering standby. The V PP value must\nbe above V PPLK  and the block must be unlocked.\nDuring a BLOCK ERASE operation, the device executes a sequence of internally-timed\nevents that conditions, erases, and verifies all bits within the block. Erasing the array\nchanges the value in each cell from a 1 to a 0. Memory block array cells that with a value\nof 1 can be changed to 0 only by programming the block.\nThe status register can be examined for block erase progress and errors by reading any\naddress. The device remains in the read status register state until another command is\nwritten. SR0 indicates whether the addressed block is erasing. SR7 is set upon erase\ncompletion.\nSR7 indicates block erase status while the sequence executes. When the BLOCK ERASE\noperation has completed, SR5 = 1 (set) indicates an erase failure. SR3 = 1 indicates that\nthe device could not perform the BLOCK ERASE operation because V PP was outside of\nits acceptable limits. SR1 = 1 indicates that the BLOCK ERASE operation attempted to\nerase a locked block, causing the operation to abort.\nBefore issuing a new command, the status register contents should be examined and\nthen cleared using the CLEAR STATUS REGISTER command. Any valid command can\nfollow after the BLOCK ERASE operation has completed.\nThe BLOCK ERASE operation is aborted by performing a reset or powering down the\ndevice. In either case, data integrity cannot be ensured, and it is recommended to erase\nagain the blocks aborted.\nBLANK CHECK Command\nThe BLANK CHECK operation determines whether a specified main block is blank; that\nis, completely erased. Other than a BLANK CHECK operation, only a BLOCK ERASE op-\neration can ensure a block is completely erased. BLANK CHECK is especially useful\nwhen a BLOCK ERASE operation is interrupted by a power loss event.\nA BLANK CHECK operation can apply to only one block at a time. The only operation\nallowed simultaneously is a READ STATUS REGISTER operation. SUSPEND and RE-\nSUME operations and a BLANK CHECK operation are mutually exclusive.\nA BLANK CHECK operation is initiated by writing the BLANK CHECK SETUP command\nto the block address, followed by the CHECK CONFIRM command. When a successful\ncommand sequence is entered, the device automatically enters the read status state.\nThe device then reads the entire specified block and determines whether any bit in the\nblock is programmed or over-erased.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nErase Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nBLANK CHECK operation progress and errors are determined by reading the status reg-\nister at any address within the block being accessed. SR7 = 0 is a BLANK CHECK busy\nstatus. SR7 = 1 is a BLANK CHECK operation complete status. The status register should\nbe checked for any errors and then cleared. If the BLANK CHECK operation fails, mean-\ning the block is not completely erased, SR5 = 1. CE# or OE# toggle (during polling) up-\ndates the status register.\nThe READ STATUS REGISTER command must always be followed by a CLEAR STATUS\nREGISTER command. The device remains in status register mode until another com-\nmand is written to the device. Any command can follow once the BLANK CHECK com-\nmand is complete.\nERASE SUSPEND Command\nThe ERASE SUSPEND command suspends a BLOCK ERASE operation that is in pro-\ngress, enabling access to data in memory locations other than the one being erased. The\nERASE SUSPEND command can be issued to any device address. A BLOCK ERASE oper-\nation can be suspended to perform a WORD or BUFFER PROGRAM operation, or a\nREAD operation within any block except the block that is erase suspended.\nWhen a BLOCK ERASE operation is executing, issuing the ERASE SUSPEND command\nrequests the device to suspend the erase algorithm at predetermined points. The device\ncontinues to output status register data after the ERASE SUSPEND command is issued.\nBlock erase is suspended when SR[7,6] are set.\nTo read data from the device (other than an erase-suspended block), the READ ARRAY\ncommand must be issued. During erase suspend, a PROGRAM command can be issued\nto any block other than the erase-suspended block. Block erase cannot resume until\nprogram operations initiated during erase suspend complete. READ ARRAY, READ STA-\nTUS REGISTER, READ DEVICE IDENTIFIER, READ CFI, and ERASE RESUME are valid\ncommands during erase suspend. Additionally, CLEAR STATUS REGISTER, PROGRAM,\nPROGRAM SUSPEND, BLOCK LOCK, BLOCK UNLOCK, and BLOCK LOCK DOWN are\nvalid commands during an ERASE SUSPEND operation.\nDuring an erase suspend, de-asserting CE# places the device in standby, reducing active\ncurrent. V PP must remain at a valid level, and WP# must remain unchanged while in\nerase suspend. If RST# is asserted, the device is reset.\nERASE RESUME Command\nThe ERASE RESUME command instructs the device to continue erasing, and automati-\ncally clears SR[7,6]. This command can be written to any address. If status register error\nbits are set, the status register should be cleared before issuing the next instruction.\nRST# must remain de-asserted.\nErase Protection\nWhen V PP = V IL, absolute hardware erase protection is provided for all device blocks. If\nVPP is at or below V PPLK , ERASE operations halt and SR3 is set indicating a V PP-level er-\nror.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nErase Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nSecurity Operations\nBlock Locking\nIndividual instant block locking is used to protect user code and/or data within the\nflash memory array. All blocks power-up in a locked state to protect array data from be-\ning altered during power transitions. Any block can be locked or unlocked with no la-\ntency. Locked blocks cannot be programmed or erased; they can only be read.\nSoftware-controlled security is implemented using the BLOCK LOCK and BLOCK UN-\nLOCK commands. Hardware-controlled security can be implemented using the BLOCK\nLOCK DOWN command along with asserting WP#. Also, V PP data security can be used\nto inhibit PROGRAM and ERASE operations.\nBLOCK LOCK Command\nTo lock a block, issue the BLOCK LOCK SETUP command, followed by the BLOCK LOCK\ncommand issued to the desired block’s address. If the SET READ CONFIGURATION\nREGISTER command is issued after the BLOCK LOCK SETUP command, the device\nconfigures the RCR instead.\nBLOCK LOCK and UNLOCK operations are not affected by the voltage level on V PP. The\nblock lock bits may be modified and/or read even if V PP is at or below V PPLK .\nBLOCK UNLOCK Command\nThe BLOCK UNLOCK command is used to unlock blocks. Unlocked blocks can be read,\nprogrammed, and erased. Unlocked blocks return to a locked state when the device is\nreset or powered down. If a block is in a lock-down state, WP# must be de-asserted be-\nfore it can be unlocked.\nBLOCK LOCK DOWN Command\nA locked or unlocked block can be locked-down by writing the BLOCK LOCK DOWN\ncommand sequence. Blocks in a lock-down state cannot be programmed or erased;\nthey can only be read. However, unlike locked blocks, their locked state cannot be\nchanged by software commands alone. A locked-down block can only be unlocked by\nissuing the BLOCK UNLOCK command with WP# de-asserted. To return an unlocked\nblock to locked-down state, a BLOCK LOCK DOWN command must be issued prior to\nchanging WP# to V IL. Locked-down blocks revert to the locked state upon reset or power\nup the device.\nBlock Lock Status\nThe READ DEVICE IDENTIFIER command is used to determine a block’s lock status.\nDQ[1:0] display the addressed block’s lock status; DQ0 is the addressed block’s lock bit,\nwhile DQ1 is the addressed block’s lock-down bit.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nSecurity Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

To change\nblock locking during an ERASE operation, first issue the ERASE SUSPEND command.\nMonitor the status register until SR7 and SR6 are set, indicating the device is suspended\nand ready to accept another command.\nNext, write the desired lock command sequence to a block, which changes the lock\nstate of that block. After completing BLOCK LOCK or BLOCK UNLOCK operations, re-\nsume the ERASE operation using the ERASE RESUME command.\nNote:\nA BLOCK LOCK SETUP command followed by any command other than BLOCK\nLOCK, BLOCK UNLOCK, or BLOCK LOCK DOWN produces a command se-\nquence error and set SR4 and SR5. If a command sequence error occurs during\nan erase suspend, SR4 and SR5 remains set, even after the erase operation is re-\nsumed. Unless the Status Register is cleared using the CLEAR STATUS REGISTER\ncommand before resuming the ERASE operation, possible erase errors may be\nmasked by the command sequence error.\nIf a block is locked or locked-down during an erase suspend of the same  block,\nthe lock status bits change immediately. However, the ERASE operation com-\npletes when it is resumed. BLOCK LOCK operations cannot occur during a pro-\ngram suspend.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nSecurity Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

The password access may be combined with nonvola-\ntile protection and/or volatile protection to create a multi-tiered solution.\nContact your Micron sales office for further details concerning password access.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nSecurity Operations\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nStatus Register\nRead Status Register\nTo read the status register, issue the READ STATUS REGISTER command at any address.\nStatus register information is available at the address that the READ STATUS REGISTER,\nWORD PROGRAM, or BLOCK ERASE command is issued to. Status register data is auto-\nmatically made available following a word program, block erase, or block lock com-\nmand sequence. Reads from the device after any of these command sequences will out-\nput the devices status until another valid command is written (e.g. READ ARRAY com-\nmand).\nThe status register is read using single asynchronous mode or synchronous burst mode\nreads. Status register data is output on DQ[7:0], while 0x00 is output on DQ[15:8]. In\nasynchronous mode, the falling edge of OE# or CE# (whichever occurs first) updates\nand latches the status register contents. However, when reading the status register in\nsynchronous burst mode, CE# or ADV# must be toggled to update status data.\nThe device write status bit (SR7) provides the overall status of the device. SR[6:1]\npresent status and error information about the PROGRAM, ERASE, SUSPEND, V PP, and\nBLOCK LOCK operations.\nNote:  Reading the status register is a nonarray READ operation. When the operation oc-\ncurs in asynchronous page mode, only the first data is valid and all subsequent data are\nundefined. When the operation occurs in synchronous burst mode, the same data word\nrequested will be output on successive clock edges until the burst length requirements\nare satisfied.\nTable 12: Status Register Description\nNotes apply to entire table\nBits Name Bit Settings Description\n7 Device write status\n(DWS)0 = Busy\n1 = ReadyStatus bit: Indicates whether a PROGRAM or\nERASE command cycle is in progress.\n6 Erase Suspend Status\n(ESS)0 = Not in effect\n1 = In effectStatus bit: Indicates whether an ERASE operation\nhas been or is going to be suspended.\n5:4 Erase/Blank check status\n(ES)\nProgram status (PS)00 = PROGRAM/ERASE successful\n01 = PROGRAM error\n10 = ERASE/BLANK CHECK error\n11 = Command sequence errorStatus/Error bit: Indicates whether an ERASE/\nBLANK CHECK or PROGRAM operation was success-\nful.

Always clear the status register prior to resuming ERASE operations. This eliminates sta-\ntus register ambiguity when issuing commands during ERASE SUSPEND. If a command\nsequence error occurs during an ERASE SUSPEND, the status register contains the com-\nmand sequence error status (SR[7,5,4] set). When the ERASE operation resumes and fin-\nishes, possible errors during the operation cannot be detected via the status register be-\ncause it contains the previous error status.\n3. When bits 5:4 indicate a PROGRAM/ERASE operation error, either a CLEAR STATUS REG-\nISTER 50h) or a RESET command must be issued with a 15µs delay.\nClear Status Register\nThe CLEAR STATUS REGISTER command clears the status register. It functions inde-\npendently of V PP. The device sets and clears SR[7,6,2], but it sets bits SR[5:3,1] without\nclearing them. The status register should be cleared before starting a command se-\nquence to avoid any ambiguity. A device reset also clears the status register.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nStatus Register\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nConfiguration Register\nRead Configuration Register\nThe read configuration register (RCR) is a 16-bit read/write register used to select bus\nread mode (synchronous or asynchronous) and to configure device synchronous burst\nread characteristics. To modify RCR settings, use the CONFIGURE READ CONFIGURA-\nTION REGISTER command. RCR contents can be examined using the READ DEVICE\nIDENTIFIER command and then reading from offset 0x05. On power-up or exit from re-\nset, the RCR defaults to asynchronous mode. RCR bits are described in more detail be-\nlow.\nNote:  Reading the configuration register is a nonarray READ operation. When the oper-\nation occurs in asynchronous page mode, only the first data is valid, and all subsequent\ndata are undefined. When the operation occurs in synchronous burst mode, the same\nword of data requested will be output on successive clock edges until the burst length\nrequirements are satisfied.\nTable 13: Read Configuration Register\nBits Name Settings/Description\n15 Read mode (RM) 0 = Synchronous burst mode read\n1 = Asynchronous page mode read (default)\n14:11 Latency count\n(LC[3:0])0000 = Code 0 (reserved)\n0001 = Code 1 (reserved)\n0010 = Code 2 (reserved)\n0011 = Code 3\n0100 = Code 4\n0101 = Code 50110 = Code 6\n0111 = Code 7\n1000 = Code 8\n1001 = Code 9\n1010 = Code 101011 = Code11\n1100 = Code 12\n1101 = Code 13\n1110 = Code 14\n1111 = Code 15 (default)\n10 WAIT polarity (WP) 0 = WAIT signal is active LOW (default)\n1 = WAIT signal is active HIGH\n9 Reserved (R) Default 0, Nonchangeable\n8 WAIT delay (WD) 0 = WAIT de-asserted with valid data\n1 = WAIT de-asserted one data cycle before valid data (default)\n7 Burst sequence (BS) Default 0, Nonchangeable\n6 Clock edge (CE) 0 = Falling edge\n1 = Rising edge (default)\n5:4 Reserved (R) Default 0, Nonchangeable\n3 Burst wrap (BW) 0 = Wrap; Burst accesses wrap within burst length set by BL[2:0]\n1 = No Wrap; Burst accesses do not wrap within burst length (default)\n2:0 Burst length (BL[2:0]) 001 = 4-word burst\n010 = 8-word burst011 = 16-word burst\n111 = Continuous burst (default)\n(Other bit settings are reserved)\nRead Mode\nThe read mode (RM) bit selects synchronous burst mode or asynchronous page mode\noperation for the device.

When WP is cleared, WAIT is asserted\nLOW. The WAIT signal changes state on valid clock edges during active bus cycles (CE#\nasserted, OE# asserted, RST# de-asserted).\nThe WAIT signal indicates data valid when the device is operating in synchronous mode\n(RCR15 = 0). The WAIT signal is only de-asserted when data is valid on the bus. When\nthe device is operating in synchronous nonarray read mode, such as read status, read\nID, or read CFI, the WAIT signal is also de-asserted when data is valid on the bus. WAIT\nbehavior during synchronous nonarray reads at the end of wordline works correctly on-\nly on the first data access. When the device is operating in asynchronous page mode,\nasynchronous single word read mode, and all write operations, WAIT is set to a de-as-\nserted state as determined by RCR10.\nTable 15: WAIT Functionality Table\nCondition WAIT Notes\nCE# = 1, OE# = X or CE# = 0, OE# = 1 High-Z 1\nCE# = 0, OE# = 0 Active 1\nSynchronous Array Reads Active 1\nSynchronous Nonarray Reads Active 1\nAll Asynchronous Reads De-asserted 1512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nConfiguration Register\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

WAIT can be asserted either during or one data cycle before valid data\nis output on DQ[15:0]. When WD is set, WAIT is de-asserted one data cycle before  valid\ndata (default). When WD is cleared, WAIT is de-asserted during  valid data.\nBurst Sequence\nThe burst sequence (BS) bit selects linear burst sequence (default). Only linear burst se-\nquence is supported.

This\nclock edge is used at the start of a burst cycle to output synchronous data and to\nassert/de-assert WAIT.\nBurst Wrap\nThe burst wrap (BW) bit determines whether 4-word, 8-word, or 16-word burst length\naccesses wrap within the selected word length boundaries or cross word length boun-\ndaries. When BW is set, burst wrapping does not occur (default). When BW is cleared,\nburst wrapping occurs.\nWhen performing synchronous burst reads with BW set (no wrap), an output delay may\noccur when the burst sequence crosses its first device row (16-word) boundary. If the\nburst sequence’s start address is 4-word aligned, then no delay occurs. If the start ad-\ndress is at the end of a 4-word boundary, the worst-case output delay is one clock cycle\nless than the first access latency count. This delay can take place only once and doesn’t\noccur if the burst sequence does not cross a device row boundary. WAIT informs the\nsystem of this delay when it occurs.\nBurst Length\nThe burst length bits (BL[2:0]) select the linear burst length for all synchronous burst\nreads of the flash memory array. The burst lengths are 4-word, 8-word, 16-word, or con-\ntinuous.\nContinuous burst accesses are linear only and do not wrap within any word length\nboundaries. When a burst cycle begins, the device outputs synchronous burst data until\nit reaches the end of the “burstable” address space.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nConfiguration Register\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

Each OTP register can be individually locked.\nThe first 128-bit OTP register is comprised of two 64-bit (8-word) segments. The lower\n64-bit segment is preprogrammed at the Micron factory with a unique 64-bit number.\nThe upper 64-bit segment, as well as the other sixteen 128-bit OTP registers, are blank.\nUsers can program them as needed. Once programmed, users can also lock the OTP\nregister(s) to prevent additional bit programming (see the OTP Register Map figure be-\nlow).\nThe OTP registers contain OTP bits; when programmed, PR bits cannot be erased. Each\nOTP register can be accessed multiple times to program individual bits, as long as the\nregister remains unlocked.\nEach OTP register has an associated lock register bit. When a lock register bit is pro-\ngrammed, the associated OTP register can only be read; it can no longer be program-\nmed. Additionally, because the lock register bits themselves are OTP , when program-\nmed, they cannot be erased. Therefore, when an OTP register is locked, it cannot be un-\nlocked.\nThe OTP registers can be read from an OTP-RA address. To read the OTP register, a\nREAD DEVICE IDENTIFIER command is issued at an OTP-RA address to place the de-\nvice in the read device identifier state. Next, a READ operation is performed using the\naddress offset corresponding to the register to be read. The Device Identifier Informa-\ntion table shows the address offsets of the OTP registers and lock registers. PR data is\nread 16 bits at a time.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nOne-Time Programmable Registers\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

Next, the de-\nsired OTP register data is written to the same OTP register address.\nThe device programs the 64-bit and 128-bit user-programmable OTP register data 16\nbits at a time. Issuing the PROGRAM OTP REGISTER command outside of the OTP reg-\nister’s address space causes a program error (SR4 set). Attempting to program a locked\nOTP register causes a program error (SR4 set) and a lock error (SR1 set).\nLock OTP Registers\nEach OTP register can be locked by programming its respective lock bit in the lock regis-\nter. The corresponding bit in the lock register is programmed by issuing the PROGRAM\nLOCK REGISTER command, followed by the desired lock register data. The physical ad-\ndresses of the lock registers are 0x80 for register 0 and 0x89 for register 1; these address-\nes are used when programming the lock registers.\nBit 0 of lock register 0 is programmed during the manufacturing process, locking the\nlower-half segment of the first 128-bit OTP register. Bit 1 of lock register 0, which corre-\nsponds to the upper-half segment of the first 128-bit OTP register, can be programmed\nby the user . When programming bit 1 of lock register 0, all other bits need to be left as 1\nsuch that the data programmed is 0xFFFD.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nOne-Time Programmable Registers\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nLock register 1 controls the the upper sixteen 128-bit OTP registers. Each bit of lock reg-\nister 1 corresponds to a specific 128-bit OTP register. Programming a bit in lock register\n1 locks the corresponding 128-bit OTP register; e.g., programming LR1.0 locks the corre-\nsponding OTP register 1.\nNote:  Once locked, the OTP registers cannot be unlocked.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nOne-Time Programmable Registers\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

System software can parse the CFI database structure to obtain infor-\nmation about the device, such as block size, density, bus width, and electrical specifica-\ntions. The system software determines which command set to use to properly perform a\nWRITE command, a BLOCK ERASE or READ command, and to otherwise control the\ndevice. Information in the CFI database can be viewed by issuing the READ CFI com-\nmand.\nREAD CFI Structure Output\nThe READ CFI command obtains CFI database structure information and always out-\nputs it on the lower byte, DQ[7:0], for a word-wide (x16) device. This CFI-compliant de-\nvice always outputs 00h data on the upper byte (DQ[15:8]).\nThe numerical offset value is the address relative to the maximum bus width the device\nsupports. For this device family, the starting address is a 10h, which is a word address\nfor x16 devices. For example, at this starting address of 10h, a READ CFI command out-\nputs an ASCII Q in the lower byte and 00h in the higher byte as shown here.\nIn all the CFI tables shown here, address and data are represented in hexadecimal nota-\ntion. In addition, because the upper byte of word-wide devices is always 00h, as shown\nin the example here, the leading 00 has been dropped and only the lower byte value is\nshown. Following is a table showing the CFI output for a x16 device, beginning at ad-\ndress 10h and a table showing an overview of the CFI database sections with their ad-\ndresses.\nTable 17: Example of CFI Output (x16 device) as a Function of Device and Mode\nDeviceHex\nOffsetHex\nCodeASCII Value\n(DQ[15:8])ASCII Value\n(DQ[7:0])\nAddress 00010: 51 00 Q\n00011: 52 00 R\n00012: 59 00 Y\n00013: P_ID LO 00 Primary vendor ID\n00014: P_ID HI 00\n00015: PLO 00 Primary vendor table address\n00016: PHI 00\n00017: A_ID LO 00 Alternate vendor ID\n00018: A_ID HI 00\n:\n::\n::\n::\n:512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nCommon Flash Interface\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.

Otherwise\nVCC and V CCQ should attain their minimum operating voltage before applying V PP dur-\ning power up. V CC should attain V SS during power down. Device inputs should not be\ndriven before supply voltage = V CC,min .\nPower supply transitions should only occur when RST# is LOW. This protects the device\nfrom accidental programming or erasure during power transitions.\nAsserting RST# during a system reset is important with automated program/erase devi-\nces because systems typically expect to read from the device when coming out of reset.\nIf a CPU reset occurs without a device reset, proper CPU initialization may not occur.\nThis is because the device may be providing status information, instead of array data as\nexpected. Connect RST# to the same active LOW reset signal used for CPU initialization.\nBecause the device is disabled when RST# is asserted, it ignores its control inputs dur-\ning power-up/down. Invalid bus conditions are masked, providing a level of memory\nprotection.\nTable 32: Power and Reset\nParameter Symbol Min Max Unit Notes\nRST# pulse width LOWtPLPH 100 – ns 1, 2, 3, 4\nRST# LOW to device reset during erasetPLPH – 25 us 1, 3, 4, 7\nRST# LOW to device reset during program – 25 1, 3, 4, 7\nVCC Power valid to RST# de-assertion (HIGH)tVCCPH 300 – 1, 4, 5, 6\nNotes: 1. These specifications are valid for all device versions (packages and speeds).\n2. The device may reset if tPLPH is < tPLPH MIN, but this is not guaranteed.\n3.

Three basic power supply cur-\nrent considerations are 1) standby current levels, 2) active current levels, and 3) transi-\nent peaks produced when CE# and OE# are asserted and de-asserted.\nWhen the device is accessed, internal conditions change. Circuits within the device ena-\nble charge pumps, and internal logic states change at high speed. These internal activi-\nties produce transient signals. Transient current magnitudes depend on the device out-\nputs’ capacitive and inductive loading. Two-line control and correct de-coupling capac-\nitor selection suppress transient voltage peaks.\nBecause the devices draw their power from V CC, VPP, and V CCQ, each power connection\nshould have a 0.1µF and a 0.01µF ceramic capacitor to ground. High-frequency, inher-\nently low-inductance capacitors should be placed as close as possible to package leads.\nAdditionally, for every eight devices used in the system, a 4.7µF electrolytic capacitor\nshould be placed between power and ground close to the devices. The bulk capacitor is\nmeant to overcome voltage droop caused by PCB trace inductance.512Mb, 1Gb, 2Gb: \nP30-65nm\nPower and Reset Specifications\n09005aef845667b3\np30_65nm_MLC_512Mb-1gb_2gb.pdf - Rev.
