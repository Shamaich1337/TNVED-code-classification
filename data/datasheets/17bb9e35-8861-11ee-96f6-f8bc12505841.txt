The IC can control one or more paralleled N -\nMOSFETs to emulate the behavior of Schottky diode rectifi ers. The drain to source voltage is sensed differentially \nto determine the polarity of the current and turn the power switch on and off in proximity of the zero current \ntransition. The cycle -by-cycle MOT protection circuit can automatically detect no load condition and turn off gate \ndriver output to avoid negative current flowing through the MOSFETs.

It is possible to turn off  the IC by \npulling this pin below the minimum turn off threshold voltage, without damage to the IC.   \nTo prevent noise problems, a bypass ceramic capacitor connected to Vcc and COM should be placed as close as possible to \nthe IR11662. This pin is internally clamped.  \n \nOVT: Offset Voltage Trimming  \nThe OVT pin will program the amount of input offset voltage for the turn -off threshold V TH1. \nThe pin can be optionally tied to ground, to VCC or left floating, to select 3 ranges of input offset trimming.  \nThis programming feature allows for accommodating different R Dson MOSFETs.  \n \nMOT: Minimum On Time  \nThe MOT programming pin controls the amount of minimum on time. Once V TH2 is crossed for the first time, the gate signal will \nbecome active and turn on the power FET. Spurious ringings and oscillations can trigger the input comparator off. The MOT \nblanks the input comparator keeping the FET on for a  minimum time.  \nThe MOT is programmed between 200ns and 3us (typ.) by using a resistor referenced to COM.  \n \nEN: Enable  \nThis pin is used to activate the IC “sleep” mode by pulling the voltage level below 1.6V (typ). In sleep mode the IC will consume \na minimum  amount of current. All switching functions will be disabled and the gate will be inactive.  The EN pin voltage cannot \nlinger between the Enable low and Enable high thresholds. The pin is intended to operate as a switch with the pin voltage eit her \nabove or below the threshold range.  The Enable control pin (EN) is not intended to operate at high frequency. For proper \noperation, EN positive pulse width needs to be longer than 20µs, EN negative pulse width needs to be longer than 10µs.  \nPlease refer to Figure 12 B for definition the definition of EN pulse width.  \n \nVD: Drain Voltage Sense  \nVD is the voltage sense pin for the power MOSFET Drain. This is a high voltage pin and particular care must be taken in \nproperly routing the connection to the power MOSFET drain.  \nAdditional filtering and or current limiting on this pin are not recommended as it would limit switching performance of the IC . \n \nVS: Source Voltage Sense  \nVS is the differential sense pin for the power MOSFET Source. This pin must not be connected directly t o the power ground pin \n(7) but must be used to create a Kelvin contact as close as possible to the power MOSFET source pin.  \n \nGND: Ground  \nThis is ground potential pin of the integrated control circuit.  The internal devices and gate driver are referenced to this point.   \n \nVGATE: Gate Drive Output  \nThis is the gate drive output of the IC.  Drive voltage is internally limited and provides 1A pe ak source and 4A peak sink \ncapability. Although this pin can be directly connected to the power MOSFET gate, the use of minimal gate resistor is \nrecommended, especially when putting multiple FETs in parallel.  \nCare must be taken in order to keep the gate l oop as short and as small as possible in order to achieve optimal switching \nperformance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n IR11662S  \n \n 12 www.irf.com   © 20 13 International Rectifier  Nov 6 , 2013  \n \nApplication Information and Additional Details  \n \n \nState Diagram  \n \n \nUVLO/Sleep Mode  \nThe IC remains in the UVLO condition until the voltage on the VCC pin exceeds the VCC turn on threshold voltage, V CC \nON. During the time the IC remains in the UVLO state, the gate drive circuit is inactive and the IC draws a quiescent \ncurrent of I CC START .  The UVLO mode is accessible from any other state of operation whenever the IC supply voltage \ncondition of VCC < V CC UVLO   occurs.    \nThe sleep mode is initiated by pulling the EN pin below 1.6V (typ).  In this mode the IC is essentially shut down and dr aws \na very low quiescent supply current.  \n \nNormal Mode  and Synchronized Enable Function  \nThe IC enters in normal operating mode once the UVLO voltage has been exceeded  and the EN voltage is above V ENHI \nthreshold . When the IC enters the Normal Mode from the UVLO Mode , the GATE output is dis abled (stays low) un til V DS \nexceeds V TH3 to activate the gate.  This ensure s that the GATE output is not e nabled in the middle of a switching cycle. \nThis logic prevents any reverse currents across the device due to the minim um on time function in the IC. The gate will \ncontinuously drive the SR MOSFET after this one -time activation. The Cycle by Cycle MOT protection circuit is enabled in \nNormal Mode.  \n \nMOT Protection Mode  \nIf the secondary current conduction time is shorter than  the MOT (Minimum On Time) setting, the next driver output is \ndisabled. This function can avoid reverse current that occurs when the system works at very low duty -cycles or at very \nlight/no load conditions and reduce system standby power consumption by dis abling GATE outputs. The Cycle by Cycle \nMOT Check circuit is always activated under Normal Mode and MOT Protection Mode, so that the IC can automatically \nresume normal operation once the load increases to a level and the secondary current conduction time i s longer than \nMOT.  \n \nPOWER ON\nGate Inactive\nUVLO MODE\nVCC < VCCon\nGate Inactive\nICC max = 200uA\nNORMAL\nGate Active\nGate PW ≥ MOT\nCycle by Cycle MOT Check EnabledVCC > VCCon,\nENABLE HIGH &\nVDS>VTH3\nVCC < VCCuvlo\nor\nENABLE LOW\nMOT PROTECTION \nMODE\nGate Output DisabledVDS>VTH1 @ MOT VDS<VTH1 @ MOT\n IR11662S  \n \n 13 www.irf.com   © 20 13 International Rectifier  Nov 6 , 2013  \n \nGeneral Description  \n \nThe IR116 62 Smart Rectifier IC can emulate the operation of diode rectifier by properly driving a Synchronous Rectifier (SR) \nMOSFET. The direction of the rectified current is sensed by the input comparator using the power MOSFET R Dson as a shunt \nresistance and the GA TE pin of the MOSFET is driven accordingly.  \nInternal blanking logic is used to prevent spurious transitions and guarantee operation in continuous (CCM), discontinuous \n(DCM) and critical (CrCM) conduction mode.  \n \nIR11662 is suitable for Flyback and Resonant Half-Bridge topologies.  \n \n \n \nFigure 1 : Input comparator thresholds  \n \nFlyback Application  \n \nThe modes of operation for a Flyback circuit differ mainly for the turn -off phase of the SR switch, while the turn -on phase of the \nsecondary switch (which corresponds t o the turn off of the primary side switch) is identical.   \n \nTurn -on phase   \nWhen the conduction phase of the SR FET is initiated, current will start flowing through its body diode, generating a negativ e \nVDS voltage across it. The body diode has generally a much higher voltage drop than the one caused by the MOSFET on \nresistance and therefore will trigger the turn -on threshold V TH2. \nAt that point the IR11662  will drive the gate of MOSFET on which will in turn  cause the conduction voltage VDS to drop down. \nThis drop is usually accompanied by some amount of ringing, that can  trigger the input comparator to turn off; hence,   a \nMinimum On Time (MOT) blanking period is used that will maintain the power MOSFET on for a minimum amount of time.  \nThe programmed MOT will limit also the minimum duty cycle of the SR MOSFET and, as a consequence, the max duty cycle of \nthe primary side switch.  \n \nDCM/CrCM Turn -off phase   \nOnce the SR MOSFET has been turned on, it will remain on until the rectified current will decay to the level where V DS will cross \nthe turn -off threshold V TH1. This will happen differently depending on the mode of operation.  \nIn DCM the current will cross the threshold with a relatively low dI/dt. Once the thre shold is crossed, the current will start flowing \nagain thru the body diode, causing the V DS voltage to jump negative. Depending on the amount of residual current, V DS may \ntrigger once again the turn on threshold: for this reason V TH2 is blanked for a certa in amount of time (T BLANK ) after V TH1 has been \ntriggered.  \nThe blanking time is internally set. As soon as V DS crosses the positive threshold V TH3 also the blanking time is terminated and \nthe IC is ready for next conduction cycle.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVGate\nVTH1 VTH2 VTH3VDS\n IR11662S  \n \n 14 www.irf.com   © 20 13 International Rectifier  Nov 6 , 2013  \n \n \n \nFigure 2 : Primar y and secondary currents and voltages for DCM mode   \n \n \nFigure 3 : Primary and secondary currents and voltages for CrCM mode   \n \nCCM Turn -off phase   \nIn CCM mode the turn off transition is much steeper and dI/dt  involved is much higher. The turn on phase is identical to DCM \nor CrCM and therefore won’t be repeated here.  \nDuring the SR FET conduction phase the current will decay linearly, and so will V DS on the SR FET.  \nOnce the primary switch will start to turn back  on, the SR FET current will rapidly decrease crossing V TH1 and turning the gate \noff. The turn off speed is critical to avoid cross conduction on the primary side and reduce switching losses.  \nAlso in this case a blanking period will be applied, but given t he very fast nature of this transition, it will be reset as soon as \nVDS crosses V TH3. \nIPRIM\nISEC\nVSECVPRIM\ntime\ntimeT1 T2 T3\nIPRIM\nISEC\nVSECVPRIM\ntime\ntimeT1 T2\n IR11662S  \n \n 15 www.irf.com   © 20 13 International Rectifier  Nov 6 , 2013  \n \n \nFigure 4 : Primary and secondary currents and voltages for CCM mode   \n \nThe operation waveforms of IR11662 in a flyback converter under CCM mode and DCM/CrCM  were shown in Figure 5 and \nFigure 6 respectively.  \n \n \nFigure 5 : Secondary side CCM operation    \n \nIPRIM\nISEC\nVSECVPRIM\ntime\ntimeT1 T2\nISEC\nVDS\ntime\ntimeT1 T2\nVTH1\nVTH2VTH3\nBlanking\nMOT timeGate Drive\n IR11662S  \n \n 16 www.irf.com   © 20 13 International Rectifier  Nov 6 , 2013  \n \n \nFigure 6 : Secondary side DCM/CrCM  operation    \n \nResonant Half -Bridge  Application  \n \nThe typical application circuit of IR11662 in LLC half -bridge is shown in Figure 7.  \n \nFigure 7: Resonant half -bridge application circuit  \n \nIn resonant half -bridge converter, the turn -on phase and turn -off phase is similar to Flyback except the current shape i s \nsinusoid.
