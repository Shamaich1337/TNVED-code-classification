No external trims arerequired to achieve full specified performance.\nThe output amplifier is capable of developing +10 V across a\n2 kΩ load. The output voltage ranges with single supply opera-\ntion are 0 V to +5 V or 0 V to +10 V, while an additional bipo-\nlar ±5 V output range is available with dual supplies. The ranges\nare selected using the internal gain resistor.\nThe data format is natural binary in both unipolar ranges, while\neither offset binary or two’s complement format may be selectedin the bipolar range. A CLR  function is provided which sets the\noutput to 0 V in both unipolar ranges and in the two’s comple-ment bipolar range, while with offset binary data format, theoutput is set to –REFIN. This function is useful as a power-on\nreset as it allows the output to be set to a known voltage level.\nThe AD7243 features a fast versatile serial interface which\nallows easy connection to both microcomputers and 16-bit digi-tal signal pro cessors with serial ports. The serial data may be\napplied at rates up to 5 MHz allowing a DAC update rate of300 kHz. A serial data output capability is also provided whichallows daisy chaining in multi-DAC systems. This feature allows\nany number of DACs to be used in a system with a simple\n4-wire interface. All DACs may be updated simultaneouslyusing LDAC .The AD7243 is fabricated on Linear Compatible CMOS\n(LC\n2MOS), an advanced, mixed technology process. It is pack-\naged in 16-lead DIP and 16-lead SOIC packages.\nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1. Complete 12-Bit DACPORT®\nThe AD7243 is a complete, voltage output, 12-bit DAC ona single chip. The single chip design is inherently more\nreliable than multichip designs.\n2. Single or Dual Supply Operation.\n3. Minimum 3-wire interface to most DSP processors.4. DAC Update Rate–300 kHz.5.

Three different output voltage ranges can\nbe chosen: 0 V to +5 V, 0 to +10 V and –5 V to +5 V.\n15 V SS Negative Power Supply (used for the output amplifier only, may be connected to 0 V for single supplyoperation or to –12 V to –15 V for dual supplies).\n16 V DD Positive Power Supply (+12 V to +15 V).TERMINOLOGY\nBipolar Zero Error\nBipolar Zero Error is the voltage measured at V OUT when the\nDAC is configured for bipolar output and loaded with all 0s\n(Two’s Complement Coding) or with 1000 0000 0000 (Offset\nBinary Coding). It is due to a combination of offset errors in theDAC, amplifier and mismatch between the internal gain resis-\ntors around the amplifier.\nFull-Scale Error\nFull-Scale Error is a measure of the output error when the am-\nplifier output is at full scale (for the bipolar output range full\nscale is either positive or negative full scale). It is measured with\nrespect to the reference input voltage and includes the offseterrors.\nDigital-to-Analog Glitch Impulse\nThis is the voltage spike that appears at V OUT when the digital\ncode in the DAC latch changes, before the output settles to itsfinal value. The energy in the glitch is specified in nV secs, and\nis measured for an all codes change from 0000 0000 0000 to\n1111 1111 1111 and vice versa.\nDigital Feedthrough\nThis is a measure of the voltage spike that appears on V OUT as a\nresult of feedthrough from the digital inputs on the AD7243. Itis measured with  LDAC  held high.Relative Accuracy (Linearity)\nRelative Accuracy, or endpoint linearity, is a measure of themaximum deviation of the DAC transfer function from a\nstraight line passing through the endpoints of the transfer func-\ntion. It is measured after allowing for zero and full-scale errorsand is expressed in LSBs or as a percentage of full-scale reading.\nSingle Supply Linearity and Gain Error\nThe output amplifier on the AD7243 can have true negative off-sets even when the part is operated from a single +15 V supply.However, because the negative supply rail (V\nSS) is 0 V, the out-\nput cannot actually go negative. Instead, when the output offsetvoltage is negative, the output voltage sits at 0 V, resulting in thetransfer function shown in Figure 1.\nOUTPUT\nVOLTAGE\nNEGATIVE \nOFFSETDAC CODE0V{\nFigure 1. Effect of Negative Offset (Single Supply)\nREV. B\n–5–AD7243\nTERMINOLOGY (Continued)\nThis “knee” is an offset effect, not a linearity error, and the\ntransfer function would have followed the dotted line if the out-\nput voltage could have gone negative.\nNormally, linearity is measured between zero (all 0s input code)\nand full scale (all 1s input code) after offset and full scale havebeen adjusted out or allowed for, but this is not possible in\nsingle supply operation if the offset is negative, due to the knee\nin the transfer function. Instead, linearity of the AD7243 in theunipolar mode is measured between full scale and the lowest\ncode which is guaranteed to produce a positive output voltage.\nThis code is calculated from the maximum specification fornegative offset. For the A and B versions the linearity is mea-\nsured between Codes 3 and 4095. For the S grade, linearity is\nmeasured between Code 5 and Code 4095.\nDifferential Nonlinearity\nDifferential Nonlinearity is the difference between the measured\nchange and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent\ncodes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB or less\nover the operating temperature range ensures monotonicity.\nUnipolar Offset Error\nUnipolar Offset Error is the measured output voltage fromV\nOUT with all zeros loaded into the DAC latch when the DAC is\nconfigured for unipolar output.

This refer-ence can be used to provide the reference voltage for the D/Aconverter (by connecting the REFOUT pin to the REFIN pin.)\nThe reference voltage can also be used as a reference for other\ncomponents and is capable of providing up to 500 µA to an ex-\nternal load. The maximum recommended capacitance on\nREFOUT for normal operation is 50 pF. If the reference is re-\nquired for external use with capacitive loads greater than 50 pF\nthen it should be decoupled to AGND with a 200 Ω resistor in\nseries with a parallel combination of a 10 µF tantalum capacitor\nand a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor.\n200/H9024\n10/H9262F 0.1/H9262FREFOUTEXT\nLOAD\nFigure 3.

The REFIN voltage is internally buffered by aunity gain amplifier before being applied to the D/A converter.\nThe D/A converter is scaled for a 5 V reference and the device is\ntested with 5 V applied to REFIN.

Timing Diagram (Standalone Mode)circuitry is shown in Figure 6. Serial data on the SDIN input is\nloaded to the input register under control of DCEN, SYNC  and\nSCLK. When a complete word is held in the shift register, it\nmay then be loaded into the DAC latch under control of\nLDAC . Only the data in the DAC latch determines the analog\noutput on the AD7243.\nThe DCEN (daisy-chain enable) input is used to select either a\nstandalone mode or a daisy-chain mode. The loading format is\nslightly different depending on which mode is selected.\nSerial Data Loading Format (Standalone Mode)\nWith DCEN at Logic 0 the standalone mode is selected. In this\nmode a low SYNC  input provides the frame synchronization\nsignal which tells the AD7243 that valid serial data on the SDIN\ninput will be available for the next 16 falling edges of SCLK. An\ninternal counter/decoder circuit provides a low gating signal so\nthat only 16 data bits are clocked into the input shift register.After 16 SCLK pulses the internal gating signal goes inactive\n(high) thus locking out any further clock pulses. Therefore, ei-\nther a continuous clock or a burst clock source may be used toclock in the data.\nThe SYNC  input should be taken high after the complete 16-bit\nword is loaded in.\nREV. B\n–7–AD7243\nAlthough 16 bits of data are clocked into the input register, only\nthe latter 12 bits get transferred into the DAC latch. The first 4bits in the 16 bit stream are don’t cares since their value does\nnot affect the DAC latch data. Therefore, the data format is 4\ndon’t cares followed by the 12-bit data word with the LSB asthe last bit in the serial stream.\nThere are two ways in which the DAC latch and hence the ana-\nlog output may be updated. The status of the LDAC  input is\nexamined after SYNC  is taken low. Depending on its status, one\nof two update modes is selected.\nIf LDAC  = 0, then the automatic update mode is selected. In\nthis mode the DAC latch and analog output are updated auto-\nmatically when the last bit in the serial data stream is clocked in.The update thus takes place on the sixteenth falling SCLK edge.\nIf LDAC  = 1, then the automatic update is disabled and the\nDAC latch is updated by taking LDAC  low any time after the\n16-bit data transfer is complete. The update now occurs on the\nfalling edge of LDAC . Note that the LDAC  input must be taken\nback high again before the next data transfer is initiated.\nSerial Data Loading Format (Daisy-Chain Mode)\nBy connecting DCEN high the daisy-chain mode is enabled.This mode of operation is designed for multi-DAC systems\nwhere several AD7243s may be connected in cascade (see Fig-\nure 16). In this mode the internal gating circuitry on SCLK isdisabled, and a serial data output facility is enabled. The inter-\nnal gating signal is permanently active (low) so that the SCLK\nsignal is continuously applied to the input shift register whenSYNC  is low. The data is clocked into the register on each fall-\ning SCLK edge after SYNC  going low. If more than 16 clock\npulses are applied, the data ripples out of the shift register andappears on the SDO line. By connecting this line to the SDINinput on the next AD7243 in the chain, a multi-DAC interface\nmay be constructed. Sixteen SCLK pulses are required for each\nDAC in the system. Therefore, the total number of clock cyclesmust equal 16N where N is the total number of devices in the\nchain. When the serial transfer to all devices is complete, SYNC\nshould be taken high. This prevents any further data being\nclocked into the input register.\nA continuous SCLK source may be used if it can be arranged\nthat SYNC  is held low for the correct number of clock cycles.\nAlternatively, a burst clock containing the exact number of clock\ncycles may be used and SYNC  taken high some time later.\nWhen the transfer to all input registers is complete, a common\nLDAC  signal updates all DAC latches with the lower 12 bits of\ndata in each input register. All analog outputs are therefore up-\ndated simultaneously on the falling edge of LDAC .\nClear Function ( CLR )\nThe clear function bypasses the input shift register and loads theDAC Latch with all 0s. It is activated by taking CLR  low. In all\nranges except the Offset Binary bipolar range (–5 V to +5 V) the\noutput voltage is reset to 0 V. In the offset binary bipolar range\nthe output is set to –REFIN. The clear function is especiallyuseful at power-up as it enables the output to be reset to a\nknown state.\nSCLK\nDB11 (N)\nMSBDB0 (N)\nLSB\n* = DON'T CARESDINSYNC\nLDAC\nCLRDB0 (N)\nLSBSDO DB15 (N)*DB15*\n(N + 1)DB11 (N + 1)\nMSBDB0 (N + 1)\nLSB\nUNDEFINEDDB15 (N)*\nDB11 (N)\nMSBt1\nt2 t3\nt5 t4\nt11\nt6 t7 t8\nt9t10\nFigure 8.

B \nAD7243\n–8–APPLYING THE AD7243\nPower Supply Decoupling\nTo achieve optimum performance when using the AD7243, the\nVDD and V SS lines should each be decoupled to DGND using\n0.1 µF capacitors. In noisy environments it is recommended\nthat 10 µF capacitors be connected in parallel with the 0.1 µF\ncapacitors.\nThe internal scaling resistors provided on the AD7243 allow\nseveral output voltage ranges. The part can produce unipolaroutput ranges of 0 V to +5 V or 0 V to +10 V and a bipolar out-\nput range of ±5 V. Connections for the various ranges are out-\nlined below.\nUnipolar (0 V to +10 V) Configuration\nThe first of the configurations provides an output voltage rangeof 0 V to +10 V. This is achieved by connecting the output off-\nset resistor R\nOFS (Pin 13) to AGND. Natural Binary data format\nis selected by connecting BIN/COMP (Pin 4) to DGND. In this\nconfiguration, the AD7243 can be operated using either singleor dual supplies. Note that the V\nDD supply must be ≥+14.25 V\nfor this range in order to maintain sufficient amplifier head-\nroom. Dual supplies may be used to improve settling time and\ngive increased current sink capability for the amplifier. Figure 9shows the connection diagram for unipolar operation of the\nAD7243.

B\n–9–AD7243\nMICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING\nMicroprocessor interfacing to the AD7243 is via a serial bus\nwhich uses standard protocol compatible with DSP processors\nand microcontrollers. The communications channel requires a\nthree-wire interface consisting of a clock signal, a data signaland a synchronization signal. The AD7243 requires a 16-bit\ndata word with data valid on the falling edge of SCLK. For all\nthe interfaces, the DAC update may be done automaticallywhen all the data is clocked in or it may be done under control\nof LDAC .\nFigures 11 to 16 show the AD7243 configured for interfacing to\na number of popular DSP processors and microcontrollers.\nAD7243–ADSP-2101/ADSP-2102 Interface\nFigure 11 shows a serial interface between the AD7243 and the\nADSP-2101/ADSP-2102 DSP processor. The ADSP-2101/\nADSP-2102 contains two serial ports, and either port may beused in the interface. The data transfer is initiated by TFS going\nlow. Data from the ADSP-2101/ADSP-2102 is clocked into theAD7243 on the falling edge of SCLK. When the data transfer iscomplete, TFS is taken high. In the interface shown the DAC is\nupdated using an external timer which generates an LDAC\npulse. This could also be done using a control or decoded ad-dress line from the processor. Alternatively, the LDAC  input\ncould be hard wired low and in this case the update takes placeautomatically on the sixteenth falling edge of SCLK.\nADSP - 2101/\nADSP - 2102*TIMER\nTFS\nSCLK\nDTLDAC\nSYNC\nSCLK\nSDINAD7243*\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY\nFigure 11.

The DSP56000 is configured for Normal\nMode Asynchronous operation with Gated Clock. It is also set\nup for a 16-bit word with SCK and SC2 as outputs and the FSLcontrol bit set to a “0.” SCK is internally generated on the\nDSP56000 and applied to the AD7243 SCLK input. Data from\nthe DSP56000 is valid on the falling edge of SCK. The SC2output provides the framing pulse for valid data. This line must\nbe inverted before being applied to the SYNC  input of the\nAD7243.\nThe LDAC  input of the AD7243 is connected to DGND so the\nupdate of the DAC latch takes place automatically on the six-\nteenth falling edge of SCLK.

In this interface, the CLKX and\nFSX signals for the TMS32020 should be generated using ex-\nternal clock/timer circuitry. The FSX pin of the TMS32020must be configured as an input. Data from the TMS32020 is\nvalid on the falling edge of CLKX.\nThe clock/timer circuitry generates the LDAC  signal for the\nAD7243 to synchronize the update of the output with the serial\ntransmission.

TXD of the 87C51 drives\nSCLK of the AD7243, while RXD drives the serial data line of\nthe part. The SYNC  signal is derived from the port line P3.3.\nThe 87C51 provides the LSB of its SBUF register as the first bitin the serial data stream. Therefore, the user will have to ensure\nthat the data in the SBUF register is arranged correctly so that\nthe don’t care bits are the first to be transmitted to the AD7243and the last bit to be sent is the LSB of the word to be loaded to\nthe AD7243. When data is to be transmitted to the part, P3.3 is\ntaken low. Data on RXD is valid on the falling edge of TXD.The 87C51 transmits its serial data in 8-bit bytes with only eight\nfalling clock edges occurring in the transmit cycle. To load data\nto the AD7243, P3.3 is left low after the first eight bits are trans-ferred and a second byte of data is then transferred serially to the\nAD7243. When the second serial transfer is complete, the P3.3\nline is taken high.\nFigure 14 shows the LDAC  input of the AD7243 hard wired\nlow. As a result, the DAC latch and the analog output will be up-\ndated on the sixteenth falling edge of TXD after the SYNC  sig-\nnal for the DAC has gone low. Alternatively, the scheme used in\nprevious interfaces, whereby the LDAC  input is driven from a\ntimer, can be used.\nLDAC\nSCLK\nSDINAD7243*\nSYNC\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYP3.3\nTXD\nRXD87C51*\nFigure 14. AD7243–87C51 Interface\nAD7243–68HC11 Interface\nFigure 15 shows a serial interface between the AD7243 and the\n68HC11 microcontroller. SCK of the 68HC11 drives SCLK of\nthe AD7243 while the MOSI output drives the serial data line ofthe AD7243. The SYNC  signal is derived from a port line (PC7\nshown).\nFor correct operation of this interface, the 68HC11 should be\nconfigured such that its CPOL bit is a 0 and its CPHA bit is a 1.When data is to be transmitted to the part, PC7 is taken low.\nWhen the 68HC11 is configured like this, data on MOSI is valid\non the falling edge of SCK. The 68HC11 transmits its serial datain 8-bit bytes with only eight falling clock edges occurring in the\ntransmit cycle. To load data to the AD7243, PC7 is left low after\nthe first eight bits are transferred and a second byte of data isthen transferred serially to the AD7243.

The data is then clocked into the input registers on\nthe falling edge of SCLK. Sixteen clock pulses are required foreach DAC in the chain. The data ripples through the input reg-isters with the first 16-bit word filling the last register in the\nchain after 16N clock pulses where N = the total number of\nDACs in the chain.\nWhen valid data has been loaded into all the registers, the\nSYNC  input should be taken high and a common LDAC  pulse\nused to update all the DACs simultaneously.\nAPPLICATIONS\nOPTO-ISOLATED INTERFACE\nIn many process control type applications it is necessary to pro-\nvide an isolation barrier between the controller and the unit be-ing controlled. Opto-isolators can provide voltage isolation in\nexcess of 3 kV. The serial loading structure of the AD7243\nmakes it ideal for opto-isolated interfaces as the number of in-terface lines is kept to a minimum.Figure 17 shows a 4-channel isolated interface using theAD7243. The DCEN pin must be connected high to enable thedaisy-chain facility. Four channels with 12-bit resolution are\nprovided in the circuit shown, but this may be expanded to ac-\ncommodate any number of DAC channels without any extraisolation circuitry.\nThe sequence of events to program the output channels is as\nfollows:\n1. Take the SYNC  line low.\n2. Transmit the data as four 16-bit words. A total of 64 clock\npulses is required to clock the data through the chain.\n3. Take the SYNC  line high.\n4. Pulse the LDAC  line low. This updates all output channels\nsimultaneously on the falling edge of LDAC .\nTo reduce the number of opto-couplers, the LDAC  line could\nbe driven from a one shot which is triggered by the rising edge\non the SYNC  line. A low level pulse of 50 ns duration or greater\nis all that is required to update the outputs.\nSCLKAD7243*\nSYNC\nLDACSDIN\nDCEN\nSDO\nSCLKAD7243*\nSYNC\nLDACSDIN\nDCEN\nSDO\nSCLKAD7243*\nSYNC\nLDACSDIN\nDCEN\nSDOSCLKAD7243*\nSYNC\nLDACSDIN\nDCEN\nSDOVOUT\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYDATA OUT\nCLOCK OUT\nSYNC OUT \nCONTROL OUTCONTROLLERVDD\nVOUT(A)\nQUAD OPTO-COUPLERVDD\nVDD\nVDDVDD\nVDD\nVDD\nVDDVOUT(B)\nVOUT(C)\nVOUT(D)VOUT\nVOUT\nVOUT\nFigure 17.
