#### Description:
The BAS416 is a low-leakage, medium-speed switching diode designed for surface-mounted applications. It is encapsulated in a compact SOD323 package, making it suitable for space-constrained designs. The diode features a very low leakage current, which is critical for applications where power efficiency is paramount.

#### Typical Applications:
The BAS416 is primarily used in low-leakage current applications, particularly in surface-mounted circuits. Its characteristics make it ideal for:
- Signal processing circuits
- Power management systems
- Automotive electronics, due to its AEC-Q101 qualification
- Any application requiring fast switching and low power loss

This diode is particularly beneficial in scenarios where minimizing power consumption is essential, such as in battery-operated devices or energy-efficient systems.
