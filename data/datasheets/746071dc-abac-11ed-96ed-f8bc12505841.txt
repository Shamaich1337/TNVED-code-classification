At 1.9  GHz, \nthis amplifier typically provides 20.5 dB gain, +37 dBm output \nIP3 and 1.3 dB noise figure while only drawing 85  mA \ncurrent. The device is housed in a lead -free\u2006/\u2006green\u2006/\u2006RoHS -\ncompliant industry -standard  16-pin 3x3mm QFN package.  \n \nThe TQP3M9018 has the benefit of having high gain across \na broad range of frequencies while also providing very low \nnoise. This allows the device to be used in both receiver and \ntransmitter chains for high performance systems. The \namplifier is internally m atched using a high -performance \nE-pHEMT  process and requires only an external RF choke \nand blocking/bypass capacitors for operation from a single \n+5 V supply. The internal active bias circuit also provides \nstable operation over bias and temperature variati ons.  \n \nThe TQP3M9018 covers the 0.02 -4 GHz frequency band \nand is targeted for wireless infrastructure or other \napplications requiring high linearity and/or low noise figure.  \nApplications  \n • Repeaters  \n• Mobile Infrastructure  \n• LTE / WCDMA / CDMA / EDGE  \n• General Purpose Wireless  \nOrdering Information  \n Part No.  Description  \nTQP3M9018  2500 pieces on a 7” reel  \nTQP3M9018 -PCB_IF  50-500 MHz Evaluation Board  \nTQP3M9018 -PCB_RF  0.5-4 GHz Evaluation Board  \n Functional Block Diagram  \n \n           \nTop View  \n7 8 6 51413 15 16\n12\n11\n10\n91\n2\n3\n4\nBackside Pad - RF/DC GNDPin 1 Reference Mark\nN/C\nRF In\nN/C\nN/CN/C\nRF Out / VDD\nN/C\nN/CN/C\nN/C\nN/C\nN/CN/C\nN/C\nN/C\nN/C\n \n   \n  TQP3M9018  \nHigh Linearity LNA Gain Block  \nData Sheet, Rev.
