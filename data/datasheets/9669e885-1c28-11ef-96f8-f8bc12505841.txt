This device features\nadvanced circuit design to provide ultra low active current. Th is\nis ideal for providing More Battery Life™ (MoBL®) in portable\napplications such as cellular telephones. The device also has a n\nautomatic power down feature that significantly reduces power\nconsumption. Placing the device into standby mode reducespower consumption by more th an 99 percent when deselected\n(CE\n HIGH). The eight input and output pins (I/O0 through I/O7)\nare placed in a high impedance state when the device isdeselected (CE\n HIGH), the outputs are disabled (OE  HIGH), or\nduring a write operation (CE  LOW and WE  LOW).\nTo write to the device, take Chip Enable (CE ) and Write Enable\n(WE) inputs LOW. Data on the eight I/O pins (I/O0 through I/O7)\nis then written into the location specified on the address pins  (A0\nthrough A18).\nTo read from the device, take Chip Enable (CE ) and Output\nEnable (OE ) LOW while forcing Write Enable (WE ) HIGH.

It is ava ilable \nfor download on our website as it contains information on the d ate code of the parts, beyond which the fix has been in product ion. \n18. Test Conditions for all parameters other than tri-state para meters assume signal transition time of 3 ns or less (1 V/ns), timing reference levels of VCC(typ) /2, input \npulse levels of 0 to VCC(typ) , and output loading of the specified IOL/IOH as shown in the Figure 1 on page 5 .\n19.

### Component Summary: CY62148EV30LL-45ZSXIT

**Manufacturer:** Cypress Semiconductor (now part of Infineon Technologies)

**Description:**
The CY62148EV30 is a 4-Mbit (512K x 8) Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) device. It is designed using CMOS technology, which allows for high-speed operation and low power consumption. This SRAM is particularly suited for applications requiring low standby power and high performance, making it ideal for portable devices.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Operating Voltage (VCC): 2.2 V to 3.6 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Typical Active Current: 3.5 mA at f = 1 MHz
  - Maximum Active Current: 6 mA
  - Typical Standby Current: 2.5 µA
  - Maximum Standby Current: 7 µA (Industrial)

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Ultra-low active and standby power consumption, with an automatic power-down feature that reduces power consumption by over 99% when deselected.

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Industrial: -40 °C to +85 °C
  - Automotive-A: -40 °C to +85 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - Available in multiple packages: 
    - 36-ball Very Fine-Pitch Ball Grid Array (VFBGA)
    - 32-pin Thin Small Outline Package (TSOP II)
    - 32-pin Small Outline Integrated Circuit (SOIC)

- **Special Features:**
  - Very high speed: 45 ns access time
  - Pin compatible with CY62148DV30
  - High impedance state during deselection or write operations
  - Automatic power down when deselected
  - Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology for optimal speed and power efficiency

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL according to JEDEC J-STD-020E is not specified in the provided data.

### Typical Applications:
The CY62148EV30 is commonly used in applications that require fast access to data with minimal power consumption. Typical applications include:

- **Portable Devices:** Such as cellular phones and handheld devices where battery life is critical.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Devices that require quick data access and low power usage.
- **Industrial Applications:** Where reliability and performance under varying temperatures are essential.
- **Automotive Systems:** For applications that require robust memory solutions in automotive environments.

This SRAM device is particularly beneficial in scenarios where low power consumption is paramount, such as in battery-operated devices, while still providing the necessary speed and performance for data processing tasks.
