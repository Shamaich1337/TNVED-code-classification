After the master in a transaction detects this condition, it must generate a stop condition within or after\nthe current data byte in the transfer process. Devices that have detected this condition must reset their communication and be able\nto receive a new START condition no later than t TIMEOUT, MAX . Typical device examples include the host controller, and embedded\ncontroller, and most devices that can master the SMBus. Some simple devices do not contain a clock low drive circuit; this simple kind\nof device typically may reset its communications port after a start or a stop condition. A timeout condition can only be ensured if the\ndevice that is forcing the timeout holds the SMBCLK low for t TIMEOUT, MAX  or longer\n(4) t PMB-HIGH, MAX  provides a simple guaranteed method for masters to detect bus idle conditions. A master can assume that the bus is\nfree if it detects that the clock and data signals have been high for greater than t HIGH, MAX .\n(5) t PMB-LOW-SEXT  is the cumulative time a given slave device is allowed to extend the clock cycles in one message from the initial START\nto the STOP. It is possible that another slave device or the master also extends the clock, causing the combined clock low extend time\nto be greater than tLOW:SEXT. Therefore, this parameter is measured with the slave device as the sole target of a full-speed master\n(6) t PMB-LOW-MEXT  is the cumulative time a master device is allowed to extend its clock cycles within each byte of a message as defined\nfrom START-to-ACK, ACK-to-ACK, or ACK-to-STOP. It is possible that a slave device or another master also extends the clock,\ncausing the combined clock low time to be greater\n(7) Devices must provide a means to reject noise spikes of a duration up to the maximum specified value.\n(8) The clock used by the slave is a delayed version of the clock in the master. For that reason, launching data from the slave starts later\nthan launching from the master, and relatively speaking, capturing by the master comes earlier. If tdelay is large on a given board, it\nmay be necessary to increase thigh to compensate and give more time for the data to go from the slave to the master.\n(9) I2C High-speed mode is not supproted.\n(10) Due to the upper limit t LAUNCH-AVSS operation at 50 MHz typically requires changing the duty cycle of the AVS_CLK to allow more\nlaunch time for the TPS53676www.ti.comTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\n7 Detailed Description\n7.1 Overview\nThe TPS53676 is a 7-phase step-down controller with two channels, built-in non-volatile memory (NVM),\nAVSBus, and PMBus interface, and is fully compatible with TI NexFET power stages.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nAVS_CLK\nAVS_MDATA\nAVS_SDATA\nAVS_VDDIOILIMA\nFault Management, \nStatus Detection and \n State Control\nV3P3APWM7 / BPWM1APWM1\nMode Control \nand \nProgrammable \nPhase Manager\nCLKB_ONAVSP\nAVSNLoadline \nControlVDIFFADCLLA\nSMB_CLK\nSMB_DIOAVR_ENVREF\nBTSENACSP1\nAdaptive\nOn-Time Control\nand\nCurrent Sharing\nCircuitry\nSMB_ALERT# AFE, ADC, and DACGND\nCopyright © 2019, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFAULTDCLLADCLLBVISUMAProgrammable \nLoopVFBDRPA\nVDACA+\n+VRAMPA\nVCOMPA\nVISUMACLKA_ON\nBVSP\nBVSN+ Loadline \nControlVDIFFBDifferential \nAmplifier\nPhase ConfigVISUMBProgrammable \nLoopVFBDRPB\nVDACB+\n+VRAMPB\nVCOMPB\nVISUMB+Differential \nAmplifier\nVDACA\nVDACBVDACA\nVDACB\nCSPIN\nVIN_CSNIN+\n-IINFAULTCOMPA\nCOMPBCOMPACOMPB\nFREQAFREQB\nNVM\nILIMB\nLATCHATSENACSP7 / BCSP1Analog \nMuxCurrent \nSensing \nAmplifiersVISUMA\nVISUMBDCLLB. . .

This procedure\ncan take up to 20 ms to complete, during which time the device may not respond to PMBus commands.\nInitialization takes place the first time power is applied to the VCC pin and does not repeat unless the device\nis power cycled. Pin configuration is loaded during this time. Until initialization is complete, all pins remain high\nimpedance, except for the AVR_RDY and BVR_RDY pins which are pulled low by default.\nOnce initialization is complete, the device waits for an enable condition specified by the ON_OFF_CONFIG\ncommand to begin power conversion. By default the device is configured to wait for the AVR_EN pin to be set\nhigh to enable channel A, and the BVR_EN pin to be set high to enable channel B. Once an enable condition is\nreceived, TPS53676 checks that the powerstage input supply (VIN_CSNIN pin) is above the VIN_ON value, and\nthe powerstage driver is fully powered (e.g. that no TAO_LOW condition exists). This takes approximately 750 μs\n(up to 1.0 ms) to complete before the first PWM pulses are output by the controller. This process repeats each\ntime power conversion is enabled for any reason, including enable cycling or fault shutdown.\n+3.3 V Power \nApplied to VCC\nCheck for faults, \nUVLO and \nPowerstages ready, \nbegin enable \nsequence\nUp to 1 msContinue\nWaiting\nPower \nConversion \nContinuesInitialize\nNVM and Trim bits, \nPinstrap Detection\nUp to 20 msBegin accepting \nPMBus commands.\nWait for Enable \nCondition per \nON_OFF_CONFIG, \nor hiccup/hysteresis \nfault recovery \nPower Conversion\nOutput voltage \nbegins rising to \nVBOOT,\nVR_RDY releasesFault\nNot \nReady\nYet \nFault Condition\nFigure 7-1. Initialization process\n7.3.2 Boot voltage configuration (BOOT_CHA)\nBy default, the boot voltage for channel A is given by pin-detection on the BOOT_CHA pin. Alternatively,\nconfigure the device to use a value stored in non-volatile memory (NVM) for VOUT_COMMAND  using the\nPIN_DETECT_OVERRIDE  command. See Section 7.4.4  for more information. The boot voltage for Channel B\nis given by the value stored in non-volatile memory for VOUT_COMMAND  always. Whenever power conversion\nis enabled, each channel boots to its VBOOT value, regardless of whether the output voltage was changed after\nthe last boot-up.\nUse the VOUT_COMMAND  PMBus command or the AVSBus Vout command to change the output voltage\non-the-fly. This is one implementation of adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) or dynamic VID (DVID). Output voltage\ntransitions occur at the value slew rate specified by the VOUT_TRANSITION_RATE  command.\n7.3.3 Power Sequencing\nThere are no strict supply sequencing requirements for TPS53676. VIN_CSNIN and CSP, the powerstage 5-V\nsupply, and the controller VCC (3.3-V) may be safely powered up independently of each other. TI recommends\nthat the AVR_EN/BVR_EN signals be asserted last, once all supplies are established and have had time to\nsettle. Refer to Power Supply Recommendations  for more information.www.ti.comTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\n7.4 Pin connections and bevahior\n7.4.1 Supplies: VCC and VREF\nThe VCC pin supplies all analog and digital circuits internal to the device. Connect a 3.3-V supply voltage, and\nlocal ceramic bypass capacitor with a minimum effective capacitance of 1.0 µF.\nThe VREF pin is the output of an internal LDO with a nominal voltage of 1.5 V. The VREF voltage provides a\ncommon-mode voltage for the power stage IOUT pins, as well as internal analog circuits. Bypass the VREF pin\nlocal to the controller, with a ceramic bypass capacitor with a minimum effective capacitance of 1.0 µF. Connect\nVREF to the REFIN pins of the power stages.\n7.4.2 Differential remote sensing and output voltage scaling: AVSP/AVSN, BVSP/BVSN\nA differential remote sense amplifier enables the controller to compensate for I×R drop due to PCB copper, in\nhigh current applications. Connect the AVSP/BVSP and AVSN/BVSN pins respectively to the output voltage at\nthe load point, through the network described in Figure 7-2 . A connection to the output voltage, local to the\npower stages, shown by R LCL_P  and R LCL_N , maintains closed loop operation even if the load is uninstalled, or\nthe remote sense connection is opened. Route the differential remote sense lines as a tightly-coupled differential\npair, and maintain a wide clearance to any fast switching nets, such as power stage switch nodes or power\ninput voltage. Optionally, use a small filtering capacitor, shown as C FILT, at the controller side to improve noise\nimmunity.\nAn internal precision reference DAC generates the output voltage set-point. The reference DAC is produces\nreference voltages up to 1.87 V. For output voltage set-points below 1.87 V, no scaling (internal or external) is\nrequired, and the sensed output voltage is compared directly to the reference voltage.\nFor output voltage set-points between 1.87 V and 3.74 V, the controller applies internal scaling of the remote\nsense amplifier, and no external sense divider is needed. Set the VOUT_MAX  command greater than 1.87 V to\nenable this internal scaling. For output voltage set-points greater than 3.74 V, apply an external sense divider\nwith R RMT_P  = R DIV = 500 Ω, and set the VOUT_SCALE_LOOP  command to 0.5 V/V. This enables output\nvoltage set-points up to 5.5 V. The overvoltage/undervoltage thresholds are referenced to the VSP/VSN pins\nonly and need to be scaled appropriately for applications with an external resistor divider. Refer to Table 7-1  for\nmore information.\nTPS53676 performs an open- and short-circuit detection on the AVSP/AVSN and BVSP/BVSN pins at\ninitialization to determine if the voltage sense lines are open. The controller flags a fault condition and does\nnot attempt to boot if an open sense line is detected. Ground the VSP/VSN lines for unused channels to prevent\nfalse-triggering, in applications which do not make use of both channels. As such, the local sense resistor\nconnection may be omitted, but is still recommended for debug and system bode plot measurement.\nVOUT_COMMAND\nVOUT_SCALE_LOOPVoltage\nReference\n DAC×RRMT_P\nRRMT_NRDIVVOUT Local\nCFILT\nRLCL_NRLCL_P\nGND LocalAVSN / BVSNAVSP / BVSP\nVOUT+\nVOUT±Remote Sense and \nDroop Amplifier\nVDACTo Control LoopVDROOP\nVOUT_MAXAVSBus\nFigure 7-2.

Kelvin connect\nthese pins to the external sense element R SENSE  as shown in Figure 7-3 ,and route back to the controller as\na tightly coupled differential pair. R SENSE  may be a precision current sense shunt resistor or an input inductor\nDCR, with an associated temperature compensation network. TI recommends adding common-mode filtering\ncapacitors, shown as C CMFILT , and a differential-mode filtering capacitor C DMFILT  to reduce measurement noise.\nA typical value for these capacitors is 1.0 µF.\nFor designs that do not use input current sensing, connect VIN_CSNIN and CSPIN together, and to the\ninput voltage supply. The controller requires input voltage sense for proper on-time generation. Ensure the\nVIN_CSNIN and CSPIN pins remain within ± 300 mV due to internal ESD protection structures on these pins.\nVIN_CSNINTPS536xx\nCSPINRSENSE\nPVINTo Power stage VIN\nPins/pads\n+±To On-Time \nGenerators\nAnalog Front-End Gain\n20 to 100       ADC\n800mV \nMax\x08\nDigital Gain\nGIINMAX  = 0 to 255READ_IIN\nGINSHUNT\nIIN Offset\nIIN_OFS = -8 A to +7.9375ACCMFILTCDMFILT\nFigure 7-3.

Section\n7.5.3  describes the process and equations for input current calibration.\n7.4.4 Pin-strap detection and PIN_DETECT_OVERRIDE\nThe ADDR pin provides limited resistor pin detection for the PMBus slave address. Connect a resistor\ndivider to ADDR as shown in Figure 7-4 . Refer to Table 7-2  to select resistor values. The table shows\nseries E96 value equivalents. Use 1% tolerance resistors for all values. The device loads the decoded\nvalue into the SLAVE_ADDRESS  command, after pin detection completes. Disable ADDR pin detection using\nPIN_DETECT_OVERRIDE , to use another address, which is not available in the table.www.ti.comTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 33\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nThe BOOT_CHA pin provides resistor pin detection for the channel A boot voltage. The channel B boot voltage\ndoes not have pin detection and must be programmed in non-volatile memory. Connect a resistor divider to\nBOOT_CHA as shown in Table 7-2 . The table shows series E96 value equivalents. Use 1% tolerance resistors\nfor all values. After pin detection completes, the decoded result is loaded into the VOUT_COMMAND  command\nfor PAGE 0.\nFor each each pin detection, during boot-up the device performs two measurements to determine an 8 bit binary\nnumber, referred to as the pinstrap decode . The 3 LSB bits are determined by shorting the high-side resistor and\nmeasuring the low-side resistor value. Pin voltage measurement determines the 5 MSB bits. Pinstrap decodes\nare mapped to PMBus addresses, and Channel A VBOOT values as shown in the tables below.\nUse the PIN_DETECT_OVERRIDE  command to achieve values not given by the tables below. This command\ninstructs the device at power-up, whether to follow the values given by pin detection, or use values stored in\nnon-volatile memory to populate the SLAVE_ADDRESS , and VOUT_COMMAND  commands.\nRHAVREF\nRLAADDRTPS536xx\nRHB\nRLBBOOT_CHA\nFigure 7-4.

By default only the AVR_EN (active high) pin enables channel A, and only the BVR_EN pin (active\nhigh) enables channel B. This command can program the controller ignore the VR_EN pins and require the\nOPERATION  command to be sent to enable power conversion, or even require a combination of the two.\nWhen enabled, first the controller waits for a delay time given by TON_DELAY , then ramps the output voltage at\na controlled slew rate SR BOOT . The device requires 750 μs typically (up to 1.0 ms), to begin ramping the output\nvoltage, after being enabled. Turn-on delay added by the TON_DELAY  is in addition to this delay.\nThe ON_OFF_CONFIG  command also controls the turn-off behavior. When configured for immediate-off , the\ncontroller immediately tri-states all PWM pins assigned to that channel and stops transferring power immediately.\nWhen configured for soft-off  the controller first waits for the TOFF_DELAY  time, then actively ramps down the\noutput voltage at a controlled slew rate.\nVR_EN\nVOUT\nTON_DELAYSR BOOT\nDecay based \non load currenttEN_INIT\nFigure 7-5.

The nearest supported\nvalue of 0.9375 mV/μs is selected.\nThe expected rise time is approximately (880 mV / 0.9375 mV/μs) ≈ 940 μs.\n7.4.6 System feedback: AVR_RDY and BVR_RDY\nThe AVR_RDY and BVR_RDY pins are used to signal to the system, when each channel is in regulation. These\npins are open drain structures, and require external pull-up resistors. During boot-up, the VR_RDY pins are\nreleased when the internal reference DAC reaches the boot voltage. Any condition which causes the channel to\nstop converting power, causes its VR_RDY pin to pull low. This includes any fault protection-related shutdown, or\nthe channel simply being disabled. The VR_RDY pins do not assert to alert the host to any warning conditions\nor faults configured to be ignored. The VR_RDY pins de-assert at the beginning of the TOFF_DELAY time, when\nsoft-off is used.\n7.4.7 Catastrophic fault alert: VR_FAULT#\nThe VR_FAULT# pin is an open drain output, which alerts the system to potentially catastrophic power supply\nfaults. The VR_FAULT# pin is an open drain structure. Connect an external pull-up resistor to this pin.\nOnly the most critical fault conditions assert the VR_FAULT# pin. Fault responses configured to be ignored, do\nnot assert the VR_FAULT# pin. The VR_FAULT_CONFIG  PMBus command provides some options to control\nwhich fault conditions cause this pin to assert.\nFault conditions which assert the VR_FAULT# pin include:\n• Over-voltage fault (including pre-bias OVP, fixed OVP, and tracking OVP)\n• Powerstage fault (TAO_HIGH)\n• Input overcurrent fault\n• Output overcurrent fault (configurable)\n• Over-temperature fault (configurable)\n• Faults from channel A only, or channel A+B (configurable)\n7.4.8 Output voltage reset: RESET#\nBy default, pin 19 functions as the channel B enable pin, BVR_EN. Use the MULTIFUNCTION_PIN_CONFIG\ncommand to assign pin 19 as a hardware voltage reset signal, RESET#, as needed. When pin 19 is not\nassigned as BVR_EN, the AVR_EN pin becomes a shared enable pin for both channels. RESET# is an active-\nlow signal. Connect an external pull-up to this pin to make its default state high (e.g. not in reset).\nAsserting the RESET# pin low during regulation causes the output voltage of both channels to slew back to their\nrespective V BOOT  values, at the slew rate defined by VOUT_TRANSITION_RATE  . While RESET# is asserted\nlow, new output voltage targets from PMBus are ignored. Figure 7-7  describes the behavior of the RESET# pin.TPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n38 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nVR_EN\nVBOOT\nSR BOOTSR VOTR SR VOTRVNEW\nVBOOT VBOOT\nNew target \nfrom PMBus or \nAVSbusReset\nAfter\nvoltage \nsettledNew target \nfrom PMBus\nor AVSbusReset\nduring\nVoltage\nslewRESET#Figure 7-7. RESET# behavior\nThe RESET# pin is not a global reset pin for the device. Asserting RESET# changes only the output voltage\ntarget of both channels. RESET# does not cause any operating state change or re-initialization.\n7.4.9 Synchronization: SYNC\nBy default, pin 19 functions as the channel B enable pin, BVR_EN. Use the MULTIFUNCTION_PIN_CONFIG\ncommand to assign pin 19 as a synchronization pin as needed. When pin 19 is not assigned as BVR_EN,\nthe AVR_EN pin becomes a shared enable pin for both channels. When there is no SYNC pin assigned,\nconfigure the SYNC_CONFIG to operate based on internal timing, in order to maintain an accurate switching\nfrequency over the full range of operation. Any external clock applied to TPS53676 must have a 50% duty\ncycle, and the FREQUENCY_SWITCH command must still be programmed as close as possible to the desired\nswitching frequency after any scaling. The input on the SYNC pin must be ±50 kHz from the configured\nFREQUENCY_SWITCH value.\nAn internal phase-locked loop (PLL) adjusting the on-time of each phase enables edge synchronization. During\nsteady-state operation, when synchronization is used, the PWM pin assigned to order 0 is synchronized to\na clock on the SYNC pin. The DCAP+ control topology is inherently a variable frequency scheme. During\nload transients, the pulse frequency of each channel modulates to maintain voltage regulation. Load transients\ncause the PLL to lose phase lock, and slowly return to phase lock based on the PLL loop bandwidth. The\nPLL bandwidth is much slower than the voltage regulation loop, and it can take many cycles for the PLL to\nre-lock following a transient event. Figure 7-8  illustrates the DCAP+ response to a load transient using edge\nsynchronization.\nIOUT\nCLK_ON\nPWM1\nPWM2SYNC\nPLL\nLockedPLL\nLockedPLL\nNot\nLockedPLL\nNot\nLockedPLL\nNot\nLockedPLL\nLockedPhase delay of \nSYNC to PWM1PLL corrects phase error \nbetween PWM1 and SYNC\nFigure 7-8.

Two clock slaves driven externally\n7.4.10 Smart power stage connections: PWM, CSP and TSEN\nInterface the controller to TI smart power stage devices, as shown in Figure 7-11 .\nConnect the PWM pins of the controller to the PWM pins of the power stage devices. The PWM pins are\nthree-state logic outputs of the controller. A PWM pin being logic-high commands the power stage device to turn\nits high-side FET on, and its low-side FET off. A PWM pin being logic-low commands the power stage device to\nturn its low-side FET on and its high-side FET off. TI power stage devices provide a weak drive on their PWM\npins, causing them to float to a mid-level value when the controller stops driving them. During enable, or dynamic\nphase addition, the controller starts phases switching with a transition from tri-state to high. Similarly, during\ndisable or dynamic phase shedding, the controller disables phases with a transition from low-to-tri-state. Float\nunused PWM pins on the controller.\nConnect the IOUT pins of the powerstage devices to the CSP pins of the controller. Connect the VREF pin\nof the controller to the REFIN pins of the powerstage devices. A local bypass capacitor C VREF, is required\nfor the controller VREF pin. Optionally, add a local VREF bypass capacitor at the powerstage devices. VREF\nprovides common-mode voltage for the IOUT signal, which is a voltage representing the output current of each\npowerstage with a nominal gain of 5 mV/A. Float unused CSP pins on the controller.\nConnect the TAO/FAULT pins of all powerstages within a channel to each other, and to the corresponding TSEN\npin of the controller. For example, tie all TAO/FAULT pins of powerstages used on channel A together and to\nthe controller ATSEN pin. TI recommends adding a 2200 pF capacitor to the TSEN pins at the controller to\nreduce temperature measurement noise. TI recommends keeping a place holder for a 1000 pF capacitor at\nthe powerstage side. Refer to the individual powerstage datasheet for more detailed recommendations. During\nnormal operation, the TSEN pins provide a voltage signal proportional to the temperature of the warmest\npowerstage device according to the equation below . During a UVLO condition, the powerstages pull the shared\nTAO line low to inform the controller they are not able to accept PWM input. When powerstages detect a fault\ncondition internally, they pull the shared TAO pin high to inform the controller a fault condition has occurred. If\nchannel B is not used, float the BTSEN pin.\nREAD_TEMPERATURE_1 =VTSEN −600mV\n8mV°C (3)TPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n40 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nAPWM1TPS536xx CSD9xxx\nPWM\nVREFACSP1 IOUT\nREFINTAO/FAULT\nCSD9xxx\nPWM\nIOUT\nREFINTAO/FAULT\nCSD9xxx\nPWM\nIOUT\nREFINTAO/FAULTChannel A\nPhase 1\n...\nChannel A\nPhase N\nChannel B\nPhase 1ATSENAPWMx\nACSPx\nBPWMx\nBCSPx\nBTSEN\nto other channel \nB power stagesCVREF\nCATSEN\nCBTSENControllerDNP\nDNP\nDNPFigure 7-11. Power stage pin connections\n7.4.11 PMBus pins: SMB_DIO, SMB_CLK, and SMB_ALERT#\nThe SMB_CLK, SMB_DIO, and SMB_ALERT# pins are used for PMBus communication, an open-drain\ninterface. TPS53676 is compatible with both 1.8-V and 3.3-V logic levels as shown in to Part I of the PMBus\nspecification, revision v1.3.1. At least one external pull-up resistor is required for these pins. The 100 kHz, 400\nkHz and 1 MHz modes of operation are supported. PMBus is a shared bus, where devices are assigned a\ncommunication address. Select the PMBus slave address as described in Section 7.4.4 . The controller device\nstretches clock pulses during operation when more processing time is required. Clock stretching support in the\nPMBus master is mandatory. See the Section 7.8  section for more information about PMBus functionality.\n7.4.12 AVSBus: AVS_CLK, AVS_MDATA, AVS_SDATA, and AVS_VDDIO\nFigure 7-12  illustrates how to interface the TPS53676 with a host ASIC or load with an integrated Serial\nPeripheral Interface  (SPI) port. AVSBus is a point-to-point protocol and does not use a chip select (CS) pin.\nAVSBus uses push-pull signaling and requires a separate supply pin, AVS_VDDIO. Connect a well-regulated\nsupply bewteen 1.14 V and 3.6 V to AVS_VDDIO, and a local high quality ceramic bypass capacitor of 100 nF\nminimum effective capacitance. The input high and low thresholds are set relative to the voltage supplied at\nthe AVS_VDDIO pin, as shown in the Electrical Specifications  table. In applications which do not use AVSBus,\nground the AVS_VDDIO, AVS_CLK and AVS_MDATA pins; float the AVS_SDATA pin.\nAVSBus communication can be run at up to 50 MHz clock rate, and may require special care in PCB routing\nfor signal integrity. Note the TPS53676 device has a clock-to-output delay of up to 14 ns, which exceeds the\nhalf-clock cycle setup time nominally given to an AVSBus slave at the full 50 MHz clock rate. This may require\nchanging the duty cycle of the clock to compensate, as described in the AVSBus specification.

This is described in more detail in Section 7.5.2 .\nAVSBus may also control the output voltage and slew rate when configured to do so through OPERATION .\nThe VOUT_MAX  and VOUT_MIN  commands define the maximum and minimum allowed voltage, through any\ncombination of offsets and voltage target commands. If commanded higher or lower than these limits, the output\nvoltage transitions to these limits and stops.\nThe soft-start and soft-stop slew rates are calculated using the current output voltage target and TON_RISE  and\nTOFF_FALL  command values. All output voltage transitions which occur during normal power conversion follow\nthe slew rate defined by VOUT_TRANSITION_RATE .\nThe VOUT_SCALE_LOOP  parameter must be set properly, when an external output voltage divider is being\nused. This value is used internally to provide scaling for all output voltage related parameters.\nUpdate the VOUT_TRIM  value to apply a static offset to the output voltage target.

Output voltage control conceptual view\nTPS53676 provides several options to fine-tune the controller response to high speed output voltage transitions.\nFor example, large output voltage steps upward cause an inrush current, required to charge the output\ncapacitors for that channel. This inrush current combined with the DC load line setting make the output voltage\nappear to move more slowly than the commanded slew rate. Use the DVID_CONFIG  command to configure\ndynamic  loadlines and offsets which apply only during output voltage transitions. Typically, set the DC and AC\nload lines for upward moving transitions to a value equal or lower than the nominal. Similarly, typically, set the\nDC and AC loadlines to a value larger than the nominal value for downward moving transitions. Refer to the\nTechnical Reference Manual  for a register map of this command.www.ti.comTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 43\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nVDAC\nDACUP_DCLL\nDACUP_ACLLDACDWN_DCLL\nDACDWN_ACLLDACDWN_DLYDACUP_DLY\nOFS_DACUPOFS_DACDWN\nVTARGET1/16 × VOUT_TRANSITION_RATEOFS_DACDWN removed at Figure 7-14.

The configured recovery delays  determine when the load line and offset values return\nto nominal settings, in terms of PWM (order 0) cycle counts. Figure 7-14  illustrates the dynamic load line, offset\nand recovery delay behavior of the controller.\n7.5.2 Output voltage margining\nOutput voltage margin testing allows power designers to test the response of their system to across output\nvoltage tolerance corners.\nThe MARGIN bits in the OPERATION  command can be used to toggle the active channel between several\nstates:\nTable 7-5.

Power stages physically located between two other power stages experience mutual\nheating as a result of power dissipation from adjacent power stages. Hence, even though the controller device\nregulates the DC current sharing of each phase, the temperature of each power stage may be different.\nOptionally, adjust the per-phase current sharing ratio K T for each phase using the ISHARE_CONFIG  command.\nThis open-loop adjustment allows the designer to balance the temperature of each phase to compensate for\nmutual heating and non-uniform ground copper for heat spreading. The per-phase current limit of each phase is\nnot affected by this setting. Refer to the Technical Reference Manual  for a register map of ISHARE_CONFIG .\nThermal balancing is accomplished by scaling the gain of each phase current, as provided to the current sharing\namplifier, in the on-time generator circuit for each phase. Refer to Figure 7-22  for more information. Each phase\nhas an independently programmable gain K T. Current share gain is assigned according to the logical phase\nnumber (PHASE setting) for each phase. The current carried by each phase when thermal balancing is active,\ncan be calculated according to Equation 17 .\nFirst, calculate the effective thermal phase number, N T as shown below. Note this value changes with different\nnumbers of operational phases, when phase shedding is enabled.\nNT=1\nKT1+1\nKT2+ … +1\nKTn(17)\nwhere\n• N T is the effective thermal phase number.\n• K T1, KT2, KTn are the individual thermal balance gains for phase 1, phase 2, ... phase n.\nThen each phase carries a portion of the total current, I SUM, as shown in Equation 18 .www.ti.comTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 49\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nIPHASE i =ISUM\nNT× KTi(18)\nwhere\n• I i is the phase current for the i-th phase in amperes\n• I SUM is the total current carried by all phases in amperes\n• K Ti is thermal balance gain assigned to the i-th phase\n• N T is the effective thermal phase number, calculated above\nThen, the current sharing ratio, comparing one phase to another is given by Equation 19 .\nIPHASE i\nIPHASE j=KTj\nKTi(19)\nwhere\n• I i and I j are the phase current of the i-th and j-th phases in amperes\n• K Ti and K Tj are the thermal balance gains of the i-th and j-th phasesTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n50 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nExample: Balancing phase temperature for 7-phase converter\nConsider a 7-phase converter with the following thermal balance gains assigned:\nPHASEThermal Balance\nGain K iVALUE PHASEThermal Balance\nGain K iVALUE\nPhase 1 K1 0.8 Phase 5 K5 1.0\nPhase 2 K2 0.9 Phase 6 K6 0.9\nPhase 3 K3 1.0 Phase 7 K7 0.8\nPhase 4 K4 1.0\nCalculate N T according to Equation 20 .\nNT=1\n0.8+1\n0.9+1\n1.0+1\n1.0+1\n1.0+1\n0.9+1\n0.8≈7.722 (20)\nPhases 1 and 7 have the same thermal balance gain, and carry the same proportion of the total current.

This increases the total converter efficiency by\nreducing unnecessary switching losses when the output current is low enough to be supported by a fewer\nnumber of phases, than are available in hardware. Use the PHASE_SHED_CONFIG  command to configure\nthe phase adding/shedding thresholds. Refer to the Technical Reference Manual  for a full listing of available\nthresholds.\nSet the DPS_EN bit to 0b to disable phase shedding operation. The MIN_PH setting determines the minimum\nnumber of phases which are active during light-load operation.\nPhase adding is detected based on the summed peak current of all phases in the analog domain. Phase\nshedding is detected based on average current telemetry, with a forced delay of 120 μs. The phase add\nthresholds are not affected by current measurement calibration, but the phase shed thresholds are.\nEach phase has 3 settings available:\n•Phase add threshold (PH_ADDx)  selects the nominal phase adding threshold. Set this value approximately\nequal to the peak efficiency point per phase to optimize overall converter efficiency.\n•Phase add hysteresis (DPA_HYSTx)  selects the phase add threshold hsyteresis. Nominally set this value to\none-half the value of the ripple current on the I SUM current for that number of phases.www.ti.comTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 51\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\n•Phase drop hysteresis (DPS_HYST)  selects the phase drop hysteresis (per-phase average current).

This\nfeature is also referred to as the DC load line (DCLL) for the control loop. Use a non-zero DC load line to reduce\noutput voltage set-point as a function of the load current, with a controlled slope. This feature is optional. Set the\nDC load line to 0.0 mΩ in applications which do not use a load line.\nThe DC load line provides two main benefits:\n• Reducing the output voltage set-point, reduces the power consumption of the system, when the load current\nis high.\n• Adaptive voltage positioning increases the allowable undershoot and overshoot during load transient events.\nFigure 7-17  and Figure 7-18  compare example output voltage specifications for systems with zero load line\nand non-zero load line. The nominal setting for the output voltage is chosen to be higher, to allow the entire\ntransient window as margin for transient overshoot and undershoot.\nVMAX(AC)\nVMIN(AC)û\x03VUNDER(SPEC)û\x03VOVER(SPEC)\nVMARG(UNDER)VMARG(OVER)ILOAD\nFigure 7-17.

Neglecting the output voltage information and\nintegration, the V COMP  signal is a scaled version of I SUM. A compensating ramp signal, V RAMP , has a slope\nproportional to the number of phases, and switching frequency setting. When the V RAMP  and V COMP  signals\nintersect, the controller fires a new pulse.\nPhase management logic distributes new pulses to the next phase in the firing order sequence. Each phase is\nassigned a firing order, at which pulses are passed to that phase. A separate, slower loop adjusts the on-times\nfor each phase based on the output voltage setpoint, switching frequency setting, and current balance error.TPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n54 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nCLK_ONVRAMP\nPWM1VCOMP\n(includes I SUM) VCORE\nTimeISUM\nPWM2\nPWM3\nPWM4Figure 7-19.

Transient response tuning is\naccomplished by changing the parameters which generate the V COMP  signal. These parameters are accessible\nusing the COMPENSATION_CONFIG  command. Refer to the Technical Reference Manual  for a register map of\nthis command.\nThe V COMP  signal is generated by the sum of three signal paths. Finally the V COMP  signal is scaled by the AC\ngain parameter, K AC.\n•Proportional path:  An error amplifier subtracts the sensed output voltage from the output voltage target, set\nby V DAC. The gain of the proportional path is set by the AC load line (ACLL). Reducing the value of the AC\nload line increases the proportional path gain, which gives faster transient response. Setting the AC load line\nto a very low value can lead to low phase margin.\n•Integral path:  The difference between the sensed output voltage and the output voltage target, V DAC, is\ncompared to the ideal droop (I SUM × DCLL) value to create an error voltage, V ERR. An integrator adjusts\nthe setpoint of V COMP , to drive the output voltage error to zero. Integration provides high DC gain, giving\nthe power supply excellent output regulation and DC load line performance. The programmable integration\ntime constant, τ INT changes the settling time of of the output voltage folliowing a transient. Increasing the\nintegration time constant improves phase margin. The programmable integration path gain, K INT, sets the\ngain of the integral path.\n•Current feedback:  The summed phase current, I SUM, with a nominal gain of 5 mV/A, is used directly to\ngenerate V COMP , as well as in the integral path to set the DC load line. The gain of this path is not affected by\nthe IOUT_CAL_GAIN  or IOUT_CAL_OFFSET  calibration commands.\n+1/ACLL\nKDIV KINT -KAC\nISUMVRAMP\nVVSP - VVSNVDAC\nISUMWINT+\n+\ní \x08+\n+\nVCOMPError AmplifierProportional Path\nIntegral Path\nCurrent FeedbackVERR\n5P\x9f\x03CLK_ONLoop \nComparator\nVDROOPN\n ± \nDCLL\x08\nFigure 7-21.

PWM on-times are adjusted very slowly compared to off-times, so the DCAP+\nmodulator behaves similar to a constant-on-time architecture.\nUse the FREQUENCY_SWITCH  command to set the nominal per-phase switching frequency.\ntON=VDAC + KISHARE ×IL −IAVG\nVIN× FREQUENCY_SWITCH+ ΔPLL_CLF (34)\nwhere\n• t ON is the on-time for the phase in seconds\n• V DAC is the output voltage set-point in volts\n• FREQUENCY_SWITCH is the commanded switching frequency in Hz\n• V IN is the sensed input voltage from the VIN_CSNIN pin\n• K ISHARE  is the gain of the current share loop\n• I L is the current carried by the phase\n• I AVG is the average phase current for all phases\n• ΔPLL_CLF is the on-time adjustment from the closed loop frequency correction circuit\nCurrent sharing is implemented by adapting the on-time for each phase, according to the difference between its\nown phase current I L, and the average of all phase currents I AVG. When the phase current for any one phase\nis greater than the average of all phase currents, the on-time of that phase is reduced accordingly. Similarly, if\nthe phase current of any one phase is less than the average of all phase currents, the on-time of that phase is\nincreased.\nThe on-time is also proportional to the sensed input voltage, which provides the controller with inherent input\nvoltage feed-forward.\nFurthermore, a frequency control loop adjusts the on-times for each phase to drive the actual switching\nfrequency equal to the FREQUENCY_SWITCH  setting. An internal clock counts the number of observed pulses\nover a set interval, and compares the result to the calculated ideal number. If too many pulses are fired in the\nsampling period, the switching frequency is too high, and the on-times are increased to reduce the steady-state\nswitching frequency. If too few pulses are fired during the sampling period, the switching frequency is too low\nand the on-times are reduced to increase the steady-state frequency. The PWM pin assigned to ORDER=0 is\nused for counting purposes, as it does not drop due to phase shedding.\nVIN +\n±gm\n+\n±IAVG\x081 µs\nFilterdischarge\n+\n+\n+VDACtON1Tristate\nPWM\nLogicPWM1CLK_ON\n+\nFrequency \nControl\nREFCLKPWM\n(one per channel)FREQUENCY_SWITCH\nIL1KT1\n×VOUT_SCALE_LOOP\nFigure 7-22.

Figure 7-23  illustrates the load insertion behavior, in which PWM pulses are\ngenerated with faster frequency than the steady-state frequency, to provide more energy to the output voltage,\nimproving undershoot performance. Figure 7-24  illustrates the load release behavior, in which PWM pulses can\nbe delayed to avoid charging extra energy to the load until the output voltage reaches the peak overshoot.\nWhen there is a sudden load increase, the output voltage immediately drops. The controller device reacts to this\ndrop by lowering the voltage on internal V COMP  signal. This forces PWM pulses to fire more frequently, which\ncauses the inductor current to rapidly increase. As the converter output current reaches the new load current, the\ndevice reaches a steady-state operating condition and the PWM switching resumes the steady-state frequency.\nWhen there is a sudden load release, the output voltage immediately overshoots. The control loop reacts to this\nrise by increasing the voltage of the internal V COMP  signal. This rise forces the PWM pulses to be delayed until\nthe converter output current reaches the new load current. At that point, the switching resumes and steady-state\nswitching continues. In Figure 7-23  and Figure 7-24 , the ripples on V OUT , and V COMP  voltages are not shown for\nsimplicity.\nIOUT\nVOUT\nCLK_ON\nPWM1VCOMP\nVRAMPISUM\nPWM2\nPWM3\nPWM4\nFigure 7-23.

To improve noise\nimmunity, the controller forces a minimum on-time whenever the PWM pins pulse high. The off-time for any\nphase is limited by a forced minimum off-time. Although TI smart power stage devices have built-in protection\nfrom glitches on the PWM pins also, this feature provides redundant protection against cross-conduction issues.\nThe controller also limits the time between sending pulses to any two adjacent phases. This is referred to as\nthe leading-edge blanking time, t BLANK . Increase the leading edge blanking time to prevent over-compensation\n(or "ring-back") by the controller during heavy load transient events. The minimum on-time, minimum off-time,\nand leading edge blanking time are programmable by the NONLINEAR_CONFIG  PMBus command. Refer to the\nTechnical Reference Manual  for a register map of this command.\nFor multiphase designs, the maximum per-phase switching frequency during transients, is limited by the leading\nedge blanking time parameters as shown in Equation 35 . The controller also forces a minimum-off-time per\nphase. The greater of the two limits the maximum frequency.\nfPHASE(max) =1\nNΦ× tBLANK(35)\nwhere\n• N Φ is the number of active phases\n• t BLANK  is the leading edge blanking time in seconds\n7.6.7 Nonlinear: undershoot reduction (USR), overshoot reduction (OSR) and dynamic integration\nNonlinear features improve the controller response to severe repetitive load transient conditions.\nWhen the controller is subjected to load transients at very high frequency, the output voltage may not be able to\ncompletely settle before the next transient event occurs. As a result, particularly during overshoot events, when\nthe controller is firing pulses infrequently, the controller integration path can see error which does not completely\nsettle. Accumulation of large overshoot error can cause the controller response to following undershoot events\nto be slower. To prevent excess accumulation of error during repetitive load transient events, the controller\nimplements dynamic integration . When the output voltage overshoots its target by a certain voltage, V DINT, the\ncontroller integration time constant can be changed to an alternate value, the dynamic integration time constant.\nUse the COMPENSATION_CONFIG  command to configure the dynamic integration time constant and threshold\nvoltage. Typically, set the dynamic integration constant to a longer time than the static integration time constant.\nIOUT\nISUM×RDCLLISUMISUM slew rate limited by inductors\nVUSR1VUSR2\nVOSRVERR\nUSR1 phases added\nAll phases added Diode braking, \nPulse truncation VDROOPVOUT\nVDAC\nVDROOP\nVDINT\nDynamic \nintegration\nactive\nFigure 7-25.

TPS53676 has two levels of USR. The USR1 threshold is used to quickly enable a\nconfigurable number of phases, USR1_PH. The USR2 threshold adds all enabled phases, assigned to that\nchannel. Use the NONLINEAR_CONFIG  command to configure the USR1 and USR2 features.\nThe overshoot reduction (OSR) feature reduces output voltage overshoot during severe load transient events,\nby turning off the low-side FETs of the powerstage devices (e.g. tri-stating the controller PWM pins), when an\novershoot event occurs. The inductor current of each phase must remain continuous, forcing the output current\nthrough the body diode of each low-side FET. This dissipates excess energy more quickly than keeping the\npowerstage low-side FET fully conducting, due to the forward voltage drop characteristics of the body diodes.\nAs a result, the transient overshoot is smaller when this technique is used, compared to simply turning on the\nlow-side FET of each powerstage. However, this results in excess heat which must be properly managed in\nsystems with highly repetitive transient conditions. Additionally, TPS53676 can be configured to truncate PWM\npulses, to reduce the worst-case response time to overshoot events. The NONLINEAR_CONFIG  command\nprovides four controls for overshoot reduction: an enable bit for diode braking, an enable bit for pulse truncation,\nthe OSR threshold, V OSR, and the diode braking timeout, which limits the maximum amount of time during which\ndiode braking takes place, to manage excess heating.

Paged\nfault conditions only cause one channel to shut down when triggered. For latch-off faults, the enable for that\nchannel must be toggled to re-enable power conversion. For example, if channel B experiences an overvoltage\nfault, only channel B stops power conversion, and channel B must be commanded to disable power conversion,\nand re-enable power conversion to continue normal operation.\nShared  fault conditions apply to channels A and B simultaneously. Shared fault conditions cause both channels\nA and B to shut down when triggered.\nWarning  conditions do not cause any interruption to power conversion.

Faults set to the ignore response do not\ncause any interruption of power conversion but do still cause status bits and SMB_ALERT# to trigger.\nFault conditions set to the latch-off response  cause power conversion to stop immediately.

The figure below describes the overvoltage\nprotection scheme in more detail.\n•Pre-Bias OVF  protects the converter while initialization runs. This protection is active t INIT-PBOV , 350 μs\nmaximum after the VCC pin voltage is established, until initialization is complete. The threshold is hard-coded\nto 3.7 V. In response to this condition, all PWM pins (regardless of channel assignment) pull low, regardless\nof the overvoltage response setting. This fault cannot be cleared without a power cycle of the VCC pin.\nThe fixed overvoltage protection becomes active after t INIT-LOGIC  , up to 20 ms after the VCC pin voltage is\nestablished. This fault detection cannot be disabled.\n•Fixed OVF  is a programmable limit based on the VSP pin voltage, above which it is not safe to operate\nthe load device. Program the threshold through the MFR_PROTECTION_CONFIG command. This fault\ndetection is active regardless of power conversion. If triggered while power conversion is disabled, this fault is\ntreated as potentially catastrophic, and cannot be cleared without a power cycle of the VCC pin.\n•Tracking OVF  is a fault limit, programmable as an offset from the current VOUT_COMMAND value. Program\nthis threshold through VOUT_OV_FAULT_LIMIT. When the VSP-VSN pin differential voltage exceeds this\nlimit during power conversion, the tracking overvoltage fault condition is detected. This fault detection is\ndisabled whenever power conversion is disabled.\n•Tracking OVW  is a warning limit, programmable as an offset from the current VOUT_COMMAND value.\nProgram this threshold through VOUT_OV_WARN_LIMIT. When the VSP-VSN pin differential voltage\nexceeds this limit during power conversion, the tracking overvoltage warning condition is detected. This is a\nwarning condition only, and does not cause any interruption to power conversion. The overvoltage warning\nprovides early feedback to they system host allowing it to make adjustments prior a fault triggering.\nIn response to the overvoltage warning condition, TPS53676 sets the appropriate status bits in STATUS_WORD\nand STATUS_VOUT and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\nIn response to the overvoltage fault condition TPS53676 responds according to the programmed\nVOUT_OV_FAULT_RESPONSE. When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins of the rail\nwhich experienced a fault to pull low immediately. Additionally, TPS53676 sets the appropriate status bits in\nSTATUS_WORD and STATUS_VOUT and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\nVR_EN\nVOUTVR_RDY\nVOFS-UVFTRKVCC\nVOV-FIXEDVOV-PREBIAS\nNo \nOVPPre-Bias \nOVP onlyFixed \nOVP only\nFirst PWM pulsesFixed +Tracking OVP Fixed\nOVP onlytINIT-PBOVtINIT-LOGIC\nVOFS-UVWTRKVOFS-OVFTRK\nVOFS-UVFTRK\nFigure 7-28.

TPS53676 supports tracking overvoltage\nwarning offsets from +24 mV to +448 mV in 8 mV steps.\nProgram the fixed overvoltage fault threshold through MFR_PROTECTION_CONFIG.

After the output\nvoltage target has been changed, TPS53676 reports the fault and warning thresholds by adding the previously\nselect offset value to the current VOUT_COMMAND.\nExample: Programming the OVF and OVW offsets\nAssume the current VOUT_COMMAND is 1.000 V, the VOUT_DROOP setting is equal to 0.5 m Ω, and the load\ncurrent is equal to 100 A.\n• Program the VOUT_OV_WARN_LIMIT to 1.128 V (1.0 V + 128 mV), to select the +128 mV tracking\novervoltage warning offset. The VOUT_DROOP is assumed to be zero for calculation purposes. However,\nthe over-voltage warning trip threshold does account for the load-line setting and is equal to 1.128 V - 0.5 mΩ\n× IOUT.\n• Program the VOUT_OV_FAULT_LIMIT to 1.256 V (1.0 V + 256 mV) , to select the +256 mV tracking\novervoltage fault offset. The VOUT_DROOP is assumed to be zero for calculation purposes. However, the\nover-voltage fault trip threshold does account for the load-line setting and is equal to 1.256 V - 0.5 mΩ × I OUT.\nIf the VOUT_COMMAND value is changed to is 1.100 V, the TPS53676 reports VOUT_OV_WARN_LIMIT as\n1.228 V (1.1 V + 128 mV), and VOUT_OV_FAULT_LIMIT as 1.356 V (1.1 V + 256 mV).

Detection is based on output current telemetry. When the sensed output current\nfor a channel exceeds this limit, the output overcurrent fault is detected. Program this threshold using the\nIOUT_OC_FAULT_LIMIT command with the PHASE set to FFh. TPS53676 supports values of 0 to 1023 A\nper channel.\n•Per-phase overcurrent limit (OCL)  is a programmable cycle-by-cycle valley current  limit for each individual\nphase current, to protect against inductor saturation. TPS53676 does not pass PWM pulses to phases when\ntheir current is above the configured OCL threshold. Other than cycle-by-cycle current limit, no action is taken\nwhen the per-phase OCL is engaged. Typically, in the case of a severe overload event, power conversion\nis disabled when the output voltage reaches the VOUT_UV_FAULT_LIMIT. This is illustrated in the figure\nbelow. Program the OCL threshold using the IOUT_OC_FAULT_LIMIT command with the PHASE set to 00h.\nTPS53676 supports values of 17 A to 130 A per phase.\n•Overcurrent warning (OCW)  is a programmable warning threshold based on the total current  (sum of all\nphases) for a channel.

This occurs for any fault conditions detected inside the smart powerstage\nitself. Refer to the individual powerstage datasheets for a complete list of conditions which cause the\npowerstage fault. Program the controller response to a powerstage fault with MFR_PROTECTION_CONFIG.\n•Powerstage not ready (TAO_LOW)  is a fault condition detected when the TAO line is low (160 mV falling,\n245 mV rising) for any reason. At power-on, the TI smart power stages hold their TSEN/TAO lines low,\nuntil their internal logic is valid, and their state is known (TAO_LOW condition). Once each device is in a\nvalid state, it\'s pull-down of the shared TSEN/TAO line is released, and the TAO/TSEN lines are driven\nby the power-stage devices, based on temperature sense telemetry. The start-up of TPS53676 is blocked\nwhile the TAO_LOW condition exists, such that the controller does not attempt to begin conversion, until the\nTAO/TSEN line is released by all power stages. During the initial power-on, no status bit or alerts are set if\nthe controller is commanded to enable with one of its TSEN/TAO pins low. This is done to accomodate power\nsequences which have the power stage 5V rail being enabled after the controller 3.3V. The TAO_LOW fault\nis a hysteretic-type response. When the TSEN/TAO pin is released, if the VR enable condition is still active,\npower conversion starts immediately.\nIn response to the powerstage fault, the TPS53676 responds according to the configured fault response in\nMFR_PROTECTION_CONFIG. When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins for that\nchannel to tristate immediately. TPS53676 then sets the appropriate status bits in STATUS_WORD and\nSTATUS_MFR_SPECIFIC and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\nIn response to the TAO_LOW condition, TPS53676 tristates the PWM pins for that channel. TPS53676 then sets\nthe appropriate status bits in STATUS_WORD and STATUS_MFR_SPECIFIC and asserts the SMB_ALERT#\nline if these bits are not masked. TAO_LOW is a hysteretic fault and cannot be configured otherwise.TPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n72 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\n7.7.4.9 Input overvoltage fault (VIN_OVF) and warning (VIN_OVW)\nTPS53676 supports two layers of input overvoltage protection:\n•Input overvoltage fault (VIN_OVF)  is a programmable threshold which sets the maximum allowed input\nvoltage, above which it is not safe to convert power. Detection is based on input voltage telemetry. When\nthe sensed input voltage exceeds this limit, the input overvoltage fault condition is detected. Program this\nthreshold using the VIN_OV_FAULT_LIMIT command. TPS53676 supports values of 0 to 19 V.\n•Input overvoltage warning (VIN_OVW)  is a programmable threshold which sets a warning based on the\ninput voltage sense telemetry. Detection is based on input voltage sense telemetry. When the sensed input\nvoltage for a channel exceeds this limit, the input overvoltage warning is detected. Program this threshold\nusing the VIN_OV_WARN_LIMIT command. TPS53676 supports values of 0 to 19 V.\nIn response to the input overvoltage fault, the TPS53676 responds according to the configured fault response\nin VIN_OV_FAULT_RESPONSE. When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins for both\nchannels to tristate immediately. TPS53676 then sets the appropriate status bits in STATUS_WORD and\nSTATUS_INPUT and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\n7.7.4.10 Input undervoltage fault (VIN_UVF), warning (VIN_UVW) and turn-on voltage (VIN_ON)\nThree programmable parameters control the TPS53676 input undervoltage protection. More detail is shown in\nthe figure below.\n•Turn-on voltage (VIN_ON)  is the input voltage at which TPS53676 allows power conversion to be enabled.\nProgram this threshold through the VIN_ON command. The input undervoltage fault and warning are masked\nuntil the turn-on voltage is exceeded the first time during power-up. TPS53676 does not act on commands to\nenable power conversion while the input voltage is below this limit. No action is taken when the input voltage\nfalls below this threshold during power conversion. Detection is based on input voltage telemetry. TPS53676\nsupports values from 4.25 V to 11.5 V.\n•Input undervoltage fault (VIN_UVF)  is the input voltage at which power conversion stops. Program this\nthreshold through the VIN_UV_FAULT_LIMIT command. This command is also forced equal to the turn-off\nvoltage (VIN_OFF). Detection is based on input voltage telemetry. When the sensed input voltage falls below\nthis limit, the input undervoltage fault condition is detected. This fault is masked until the sensed input voltage\nexceeds the turn-on voltage VIN_ON for the first time. TPS53676 supports values from 4.00 V to 11.25 V.\n•Input undervoltage warning (VIN_UVW)  is a programmable threshold which sets a warning based on the\ninput voltage sense telemetry for a channel. Detection is based on input voltage sense telemetry. When the\nsensed input voltage below this limit, the input undervoltage warning is detected. Program this threshold\nusing the VOUT_UV_WARN_LIMIT command. TPS53676 supports values of 4.0 V to 11.25 V.\nThe input undervoltage fault is triggered when the sensed input voltage falls below the VIN_UV_FAULT_LIMIT\nthreshold, and considered to be cleared when the sensed input voltage exceeds the VIN_ON limit. The input\nundervoltage fault is enabled only when either of the channels is enabled. Toggling the enable for both channels\nat the same time with the input voltage above the VIN_UV_FAULT_LIMIT threshold clears the fault, and enables\npower conversion to begin automatically after the input voltage exceeds the VIN_ON limit. In the case where\nthe enable for each channel is independent, commanding one channel to enable conversion does not clear the\ninput undervoltage condition and power conversion may not start automatically when the input voltage exceeds\nthe VIN_ON thresholds. TI recommends to enable power conversion only after the input voltage exceeds the\nVIN_ON as shown in the figure below.www.ti.comTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 73\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nVR_EN\nVINOFF = V IN-UVFVIN-UVWVIN-ON\nVIN\nOFF ON OFFPower Conversion\nNoneFault Status\nVIN_UVWVIN_UVFVIN_UVWVIN UVW is clearable 0.0 V\nNoneONFigure 7-32. Input undervoltage protection (VR_EN active high control)\n7.7.4.11 Input overcurrent fault (IIN_OCF) and warning (IIN_OCW)\n•Input overcurrent fault (IIN_OCF)  is a programmable threshold which sets the maximum allowed input\ncurrent for the converter. Detection is based on input current telemetry. When the sensed input current\nexceeds this limit, the input overcurrent fault condition is detected. Program this threshold using the\nIIN_OC_FAULT_LIMIT command. TPS53676 supports values of 4 to 128A.\n•Input overcurrent warning (IIN_OCW)  is a programmable threshold which sets a warning threshold for\nthe input current for the converter. Detection is based on input current telemetry. When the sensed input\ncurrent exceeds this limit, the input overcurrent warning condition is detected. Program this threshold using\nthe IIN_OC_WARN_LIMIT command. TPS53676 supports values of 4 to 128A.\nIn response to the input overcurrent fault, the TPS53676 responds according to the configured fault response in\nthe IIN_OC_FAULT_RESPONSE command. When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins for\nboth channels to tristate immediately. TPS53676 then sets the appropriate status bits in STATUS_WORD and\nSTATUS_INPUT and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\n7.7.4.12 Input overpower warning (PIN_OPW)\nThe PIN_OP_WARN_LIMIT  command sets an input overpower warning limit for the converter. Detection is\nbased on the input power telemetry, which is derived by multiplying the input voltage and input current\nmeasurement values. When the input current telemetry measurements exceeds this limit, TPS53676 detects\nthe input overpower warning condition. TPS53676 supports values from 8 to 2044 W.\nThe input overpower warning does not interrupt power conversion. In response, TPS53676 sets the appropriate\nstatus bits in STATUS_WORD  and STATUS_INPUT  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not\nmasked.\n7.7.4.13 PMBus command, memory and logic errors (CML)\nThe STATUS_CML  command provides information about communication errors which have occurred.\nCommunication errors are warnings and do not cause any interruption to power conversion.\n•Invalid command (IVC)  occurs when the host attempts to access TPS53676 at a command which it does\nnot support.\n•Invalid data (IVD)  occurs when the host sends data to a supported command which is out of range or\nunsupported.\n•Packet error check (PEC) error  occurs when TPS53676 receives a transaction with an invalid or incorrect\nPEC byte.\n•Communication error (COMM)  occurs when the SMBus timeout condition is detected.\n•Other (CML_OTHER)  can occur due to multiple conditions (may not be an exhaustive list):\n– Wrong transaction prototype - e.g. accessing a read word command as a read block\n– Block command send with the incorrect number of bytes, or block count was not acknowledgedTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n74 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\n– Bus arbitration was lost\n– Transaction abortedwww.ti.comTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 75\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\n7.8 Programming\n7.8.1 PMBus Interface\nTPS53676 is designed to be compatible with the timing and physical layer electrical characteristics of the\nPower Management Bus (PMBus) Specification, part I, revision 1.3.1 available at http://pmbus.org . The 100-kHz,\n400-kHz, and 1000-kHz classes are supported. Input logic levels are designed to be compaitible with 1.8-V and\n3.3-V logic. PMBus revision 1.3 is derived from the System Managmenet Bus (SMBus) revision 3.0, available at\nhttp://smbus.org/ . The communication mechanism is based on the inter-integrated circuit I2C protocol.\nA master with clock stretching support is mandatory for communication with TPS53676 through the PMBus\ninterface. TPS53676 does support the packet error check (PEC) protocol. If the system host supplies clock\npulses for the PEC byte, PEC is used. If the CLK pulses are not present before a STOP, the PEC is not used.\nTPS53676 can be configured to require PEC for each transaction in systems which require high reliability of\ncommunication.\nTPS53676 supports the SMB_ALERT# response protocol. The SMB_ALERT# response protocol is a\nmechanism by which a slave device can alert the master device that it is available for communication. The\nmaster device processes this event and simultaneously accesses all slave devices on the bus (that support the\nprotocol) through the alert response address (ARA). Only the slave device that caused the alert acknowledges\nthis request. The host device performs a modified receive byte operation to ascertain the slave devices address.\nAt this point, the master device can use the PMBus status commands to query the slave device that caused the\nalert. By default, these devices implement the auto alert response, a manufacturer specific improvement to the\nSMB_ALERT# response protocol, intended to mitigate the issue of bus hogging. For more information on the\nSMBus alert response protocol, see the System Management Bus (SMBus) specification.\n7.8.1.1 PMBus transaction types\nSupport for the following SMBus transaction types is mandatory. The use of PEC is optional. Refer to the SMBus\nspecification and Technical Reference Manual  for more detailed transaction diagrams.\nNote that the SMBus Write Block and Read Block transaction types contain a repeated start condition, which\nmay not be compatible with all I2C master device IP.\n• Write Byte / Read Byte\n• Write Word / Read Word\n• Write Block / Read Block\n• Send Byte / Receive Byte\n• Block-Write-Block-Read Process Call (for SMBALERT_MASK commands)\n7.8.1.2 PMBus data formats\nTPS53676 supports 3 data formats according to the PMBus specification. The data format for each command is\nlisted along with its address and supported values.\n•ULINEAR16 format  uses a 16-bit unsigned integer. The default LSB size is 2-10 = 0.97656 mV\n•SLINEAR16 format  uses a 16-bit number representing a decimal. This number has two fields: the 5 MSB\nbits form an two\'s complement exponent , referred to as N, and the 11 LSB bits form a two\'s complement\nmantissa , referred to as M. The decimal number is represented as D = M × 2N\n•Unsigned binary format  uses direct bit maps with each command being subdivided into multiple fields\nthat can have different meaning. Refer to the register maps in the Technical Reference Manual  for these\ncommands.\nTPS53676 accepts writes to SLINEAR11 format commands with any desired exponent value. TI recommends\nusing the default exponent listed for each command for writes to ensure consistent NVM store and restore\nbehavior.\nTelemetry commands in the SLINEAR11 format return data with variable exponent values according to the\nabsolute value of the retured value. As a rule TPS53676 returns data in the SLINEAR11 format with the smallest\npossible exponent, to provide the highest possible command resolution. As a result the host must be able to\nsupport decoding of the SLINEAR11 format with any exponent value.TPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n76 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\n7.8.1.2.1 Example PMBus number format conversions\nExample: Decode SLINEAR11 number E804h\nE804h = 11101  00000000100 b\nExponent = 11101 b.

ULINEAR16 to floating point conversion\n7.8.1.3 Raw non-volatile memory programming\nTPS53676 has 256 bytes of internal EEPROM non-volatile memory (NVM). Each PMBus command with NVM\nbackup is mapped into the NVM array. For example, if a command supports 16 possible values, there are 4\ncorresponding bits for that field. The NVM array is designed withstand being overwritten greater than 1,000 times\nover the lifetime of the device.\nThe USER_NVM_INDEX and USER_NVM_EXECUTE commands provide access to read and write the raw data\nbytes. These commands allow the entire configuration data for the device to be read/written with a minimum\nnumber of transactions, to save programming time. The USER_NVM_EXECUTE command is a 32 byte block\nwhich accesses blocks of raw NVM data. The USER_NVM_INDEX command is an auto-incrementing byteTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n78 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\ncommand which which selects which 32 bytes of memory are being accessed via the USER_NVM_EXECUTE\ncommand.\nThe Fusion Digital Power Designer  software provided for this device is capable of exporting raw configuration\ndata, as well as XML configuration files containing the value of each PMBus command.\nConfiguration validation\nThe first 9 bytes of data returned by USER_NVM_EXECUTE with index zero, are identifying information for\nthe configuration. Bytes 0 to 6 represent the IC_DEVICE_ID. Bytes 7-8 represent the IC_DEVICE_REV. Byte 9\nrepresents the currently configured PMBus slave address.\nDuring the NVM import process, the controller checks these 9 bytes versus its current configuration, and NACKs\nthe USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index = 0) command if the data does not match.\nExample: Configuration validation\n• Reading the USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index 0) from a configured device returns value 0x54 49 53 67 60 00\n00 04  60 … [NVM bytes 0 to 22]. This indicates the configuration data was generated from a device with\nIC_DEVICE_ID 0x54 49 53 67 60 00 , IC_DEVICE_REV 00 04  and PMBus address 0x60.\n• Writing the USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index 0) with the value 0x54 49 53 67 60 00  00 04  60 … [NVM bytes\n0 to 22] to a new device causes it to check its IC_DEVICE_ID is equal to 0x54 49 53 67 60 00 , check its\nIC_DEVICE_REV is equal to 00 04  and check its PMBus address 0x60. If any of these checks fail, the write\noperation is rejected.\n• Writing the USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index 0) with the value 0xFF FF FF FF FF FF  00 04  60 … [NVM bytes\n0 to 22] to a new device causes it skip the IC_DEVICE_ID check, but still check its IC_DEVICE_REV is equal\nto 00 04  and check its PMBus address 0x60. If any of these checks fail, the write operation is rejected.\n• Writing the USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index 0) with the value 0xFF FF FF FF FF FF  FF FF  60 … [NVM bytes\n0 to 22] to a new device causes it skip the IC_DEVICE_ID check, skip its IC_DEVICE_REV check, but still\ncheck its PMBus address 0x60. If any of these checks fail, the write operation is rejected.\n• Writing the USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index 0) with the value 0xFF FF FF FF FF FF  FF FF  FF … [NVM bytes\n0 to 22] to a new device causes it skip the IC_DEVICE_ID check, skip its IC_DEVICE_REV check, and skip\nits PMBus address check. No checks were performed, so the data is accepted.\nProcedure: Read all configuration data\nFollow the procedures below to read-back NVM data for TPS53676 devices.\n1. Configure the device as desired through PMBus commands, then issue STORE_USER_ALL. Power cycle\nthe device or issue RESTORE_USER_ALL with power conversion disabled to ensure operating memory and\nnon-volatile memory bytes are matching.\n2. Write the USER_NVM_INDEX command to 00h.\n3. Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE command (index = 0).\n4. Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE command (index = 1).\n5. Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE command (index = 2).\n6. Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE command (index = 3).\n7. Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE command (index = 4).\n8. Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE command (index = 5).\n9. Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE command (index = 6).\n10. Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE command (index = 7).\n11. Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE command (index = 8). The last 23 bytes of this\ncommand are not used by the device. TI recommends replacing these bytes with 00h for consistency across\ndifferent configurations.\nProcedure: Write all configuration data\nFollow the procedures below to write NVM data for TPS53676 devices.\n1. Apply +3.3V to the VCC pin of TPS53676www.ti.comTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 79\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\n2. Ensure power conversion is disabled for both channels.\n3. Write the USER_NVM_INDEX command to 00h.\n4. Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index = 0). In this example, disable the self-\nvalidation checks by replacing the first 9 bytes with FFh.\n5. Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index = 1).\n6. Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index = 2).\n7. Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index = 3).\n8. Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index = 4).\n9. Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index = 5).\n10. Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index = 6).\n11. Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index = 7).\n12. Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE (index = 8). Replace the last 23 bytes with 00h. An\nNVM store operation is automatically performed once the last block is successfully received.\n13. Wait 100 ms for non-volatile memory programming to complete successfully. Ensure that the +3.3V power\nsupply to the device is not interrupted during this time to guarantee proper memory storage and retention.\n14.Do not  issue an NVM store operation at this point. This overwrites the NVM array with the data values in\noperating memory.\n15. Power cycle the device or issue RESTORE_USER_ALL to continue operation with the newly programmed\nvalues. Multifunction pin configurations require a power cycle to take effect.TPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n80 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nTable 7-10.

AVS_VDDIO and logic levels of 1.14 V to (VCC pin voltage, 3.6 V maximum) are supported. Clock\noperation up to 50 MHz is supported. TPS53676 requires approximately 14 ns (maximum) from a clock edge to\na transition of the AVS_SDATA pin, and at very high-frequency operation, it may be necessary to increase the\nclock high time (t high) to compensate. Refer to the technical reference manual  for more information.\nThe AVSBus communication interface is similar to the de-facto  Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) standard with\nthe following configuration:\n• No chip select (CSO#) pin is used. AVSBus is a point-to-point protocol.\n• AVS_CLK idles LOW\n• AVS_MDATA and AVS_SDATA idle HIGH\n• A transmitter launches data on the rising edge of AVS_CLK\n• A receiver captures data on the falling edge of AVS_CLK\n• MSB transmitted first\nRefer to to the PMBus specification revision 1.3.1, part III for more information.\nTo enable AVSBus control in the device:\n• Ensure the AVSBUS EN CHA / AVSBUS EN CHB options in the MISC_OPTIONS PMBus command are set\nto 1b in NVM.\n• Set the value of VOUT SRC CHA / VOUT SRC CHB to 10b in NVM. This setting in itself only sets the default\nvalue of the OPERATION command bits 5:2.\n• Set the OPERATION[5:2] bits to 1100b to hand-off output voltage control to the AVSBus Interface.\nNote\nTransferring output voltage control from PMBus to AVSBus during power conversion causes the\noutput voltage to transition to a low value, until the host issues the next AVSBus voltage command.\nInternal architecture limitations determine this behavior.

During latch-off faults, and while\npower conversion is disabled, TPS53676 does not respond to AVSBus transactions. The AVSBus and PMBus\nstatus registers are independent. Clearing a warning condition through AVSBus does not affect the PMBus\nstatus registers.\nTPS53676 supports AVS_SDATA interrupt notification as defined in the AVSBus specification. When any\nwarning bit sets in the AVSBus status register, the device pulls the AVS_SDATA line low to notify the host\nof the warning condition. The AVS_SDATA line remains low until the host clears the condition through through a\nwrite to the AVSBus status register.\nEvery AVS_SDATA frame contains a 5-bit summary (StatusResp) of the current device status:\n• Bit 4: VDONE  - 1b if the output voltage has reached its commanded target\n• Bit 3: STATUS  - 1b if any bits in the AVS Status register are set\n• Bit 2: AVS CTRL  - 1b AVSBus has control of the output voltage\n• Bit 1: MFR_SPEC_1 - Set to 1b if the RESET# pin function is LOW\n• Bit 0: MFR_SPEC_0 - Set to 0b always.\nThe TPS53676 AVSBus status register is defined as follows:\n• Bit 15: VDONE  - set to 1b if the output voltage has reached its commanded target\n• Bit 14: OCW  - 1b if the output overcurrent warning has been latched\n• Bit 13: UVW  - 1b if the output undervoltage warning has been latched\n• Bit 12: OTW  - 1b if the output overtemperature warning has been latched\n• Bit 11: OPW  - 0b always. Not supported by TPS53676.\n• Bit 10:8: Reserved  - 0b always.\n• Bit 7: OVW  - 1b if the output overvoltage warning has been latched\n• Bit 6: MINMAX  - 1b if the output min/max warning has been latched\n• Bit 5: ISHARE  - 1b if a current share warning has been latched\n• Bit 4: PHOCL  - 1b if a per-phase OCL warning has been latched. Note this bit requires a PMBus\nCLEAR_FAULT and AVSBus status write to clear.\n• Bit 3: VIN OVW  - 1b if a input overvoltage warning has been latched\n• Bit 2: VIN UVW  - 1b if a input undervoltage warning has been latched\n• Bit 1: IIN OCW  - 1b if a input overcurrent has been latched\n• Bit 0: Reserved  - 0b always.TPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n114 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\n7.8.2.5 AVSBus Command Descriptions\n7.8.2.5.1 (0h) AVSBus Output Voltage\nCmd Type: 0000b\nAccess: Read / Write\nData Format: Direct, 16-bits, 1 mV per LSB (unsigned)\nSelect: 0h: Channel A\n1h: Channel B\nFh: Broadcast\nReset Value: Initialized based on VOUT COMMAND from PMBus\nSupported Values: Values will be clamped to the values of VOUT_MIN and VOUT_MAX from PMBus\nDescription: Get or set the current output voltage target.

It is common practice to limit the ripple current to between 20%-40%\nof maximum per-phase current for balanced performance. In this design example, 30% of the maximum per-\nphase current is used for channel A.\nΔIRIPPLE(target) =ICC(MAX)\nNΦ× 30% =250A\n6phases× 0.3 = 12.5 A (48)\nLtarget =VOUT ×( V in(max) −VOUT\nVin(max) × ΔI RIPPLE(target) × fSW=0.88V ×( 13.2V −0.88V\n13.2V × 12.5A × 500kHz= 0.131μH (49)\nConsidering the variation and derating of the inductance and a standard inductor value of 150nH with DCR 0.125\nmΩ, is selected. Then use Equation 50  to re-calculate the actual output ripple.\nIRIPPLE(actual) =VOUT ×Vin(max) −VOUT\nVin(max) × fSW× Lactual=0.88V ×( 13.2V −0.88V\n13.2V × 500kHz × 0.150μH= 10.9A (50)\nWith same design procedure for channel B, a standard inductor value of 150 nH with DCR 0.125 m Ω from ITG is\nchosen.\nOutput Capacitor Selection\nGenerally, consider output ripple and output voltage deviation during load transient when selecting output\ncapacitors.\nWhen available, follow the output capacitance recommendation for the load ASIC reference design. With\nTPS53676 device, it is possible to meet the load transient with lower output capacitance due to the high-speedTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n122 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nnature of DCAP+ control.

Choose 125% margin to avoid triggering current limit\nduring load transient events. For this design, choose the 47A valley current limit for channel A.\nISAT(min) = IOCL + ΔI RIPPLE = 47A + 10.9A = 57.9A (52)\nThe calculation above shows the minimum saturation current for inductor. Using same design procedure, the\nvalley current limit for channel B is selected to be 26 A.\nSet USR threshold to improve load transient performance\nThere are two levels of undershoot reduction (USR1, USR2) options. USR1 enables up to 3, 4, 5 or all normal\nphases and USR2 enables all available phases. To select the proper value, start with each USR threshold set to\nbe disabled, and then systematically lower the threshold, enabling fast-phase-addition to meet the load transient\nrequirement.\nFor this design, phase shedding is disabled. USR1 and USR2 are selected to be disabled for both channel A and\nchannel B.\nInput Current Sensing (Shunt/ Calculated Iin/ Inductor DCR)\nTPS53676 has three input current sensing options: shunt current sensing, calculated input current sensing and\ninductor DCR current sensing. Either option may be chosen for precision input current reporting.\nShunt current sensing\nIn this design, the external shunt resistor 0.5 m Ω ± 1%, 3 W, 4026 package is selected. Once properly\ncalibrated, Input current reporting is within the tolerance target.\nCalculated input current sensing\nTPS53676 includes an option to impute input current for situations in which the addition of a shunt or\ninput inductor is prohibitive. Connect pins 46 (VIN_CSNIN) and 47 (CSPIN) together, and place a minimum\n1 μF effective capacitance bypass cap from pin 46 to GND, then connect pin 46 to input supply (12 V\nnominally) before input inductor.

The\nimage below shows a typical DCR sensing circuit. From the equations below, when the time constant of the RC\nnetwork is equal to the L/R time constant of the inductor, the capacitor voltage V C across the C SENSE  capacitor\ncan be used to obtain the inductor current. However, inductor windings have a positive temperature coefficient of\napproximately 3900 ppm/°C. So an NTC thermistor is used to cancel thermal variation from the inductor DCR.\nThe design goal is for the DCR value to be invariant with the temperature. Therefore, the voltage across sense\ncapacitor would be only dependent on the inductor current over the temperature range of interest.\nFigure 1Vout VinRDCR\nC RL\nVc\nFigure 212Vin to power stage 12VinRDCR\nCSENSERSEQUL\nVcRNTC RSERIES\nRPARRP_NIIN\nIIN_CSP IIN_CSN\nFigure 8-5.

This value can be used as the sense element resistance to derive the PMBus settings as\ndescribed in Input current calibration (measured) .\nβ =RDCR × RP_N\nRP_N + RSEQU(58)\nFor this design, select thermistor RNTC as 1 k Ω, 5%, 0603, B-constant is 3650k, P/N: NCP18XQ102J03B from\nMurata. Select C SENSE  as 1 μF X7R or better dielectric (C0G preferred).\nIn order to solve the value of R SEQU , RSERIES  and R PAR, the β at three temperature points are set equal. set β =\n0.15 m Ω equally at temperature 0 °C, 25 °C and 75 °C. With the calculation, three resistors value can be found\nas R SEQU  = 332 Ω, R SERIES  = 432 Ω, R PAR = 1.40 kΩ.\nFigure 8-6.

The VCC supply, power stage VDD 5V\nsupply, VIN_CSNIN and CSPIN supplies may be safely powered up independently of each other, even if the\nVCC supply voltage is off and low-impedance. Do not raise pull-up voltages for open-drain pins AVR_RDY,\nBVR_RDY, SMB_ALRT#, SMB_DIO, VR_FAULT# before the VCC supply, or pull them to voltages above the\nVCC voltage during operation. Similarly, it is not recommended to pull the AVS_VDDIO supply above VCC,\nor pull the AVS_CLK, AVS_MDATA, AVS_SDATA pins above AVS_VDDIO. If system sequencing requirements\nmandate raising the pull-up voltages for these pins prior to VCC being established, limit the pin current to 1.0 mA\nto avoid damage to the device.\nThe minimum pull-up resistor value for open drain pins AVR_RDY, BVR_RDY, SMB_ALRT#, SMB_DIO,\nVR_FAULT# is limited by the allowable sinking current for the pin. The maximum pull-up resistor value is limited\nby the off-state leakage current for the pin, and the logic level of any downstream device using the pin as an\ninput. The table below summarizes the allowable sinking current and off-state leakage for open drain IO pins.\nTable 9-1. Open Drain Pin Current Capability\nOpen-drain PinMaximum Current\nOn-state Sinking\n(mA)Off-state leakage 1\n(μA)\nAVR_RDY 25.0 1.0\nBVR_RDY 25.0 1.0\nSMB_ALRT# 20.0 1.0\nSMB_DIO 20.0 1.0\nVR_FAULT# 20.0 4.0\n1. T J = 125°C\nFor input pins ACSPx, BCSPx, AVR_EN, BVR_EN, SYNC, RESET#, which exceed the VCC pin value during\noperation, during power-on or otherwise, include a series resistor of 10.0 k Ω or greater to limit the current into\nthe pin.\nIt is safe to power-on the VDD 5V supply to TI smart power stage devices prior to TPS53676 VCC. TI smart\npower stage devices do not source any unsafe voltages or currents into TPS53676 ACSPx, BCSPx, ATSEN,\nBTSEN, APWMx, BPWMx pins when the VCC pin is not powered.\nTI smart power stages (CSD95xxx) provide hysteresis current on their PWM input pins to improve noise\nimmunity. This current is active when the power stage is powered by 5V VDD and enabled, regardless of the\nstatus of VCC. When the VCC pin of TPS53676 is unpowered, this hysteresis current flows through the PWM\npins, to ESD structures in the controller, causing the PWM pin voltage to float low, out of the tri-state window.\nThis can cause the power stage device to switch its low-side power MOSFET on. As a result, in any case where\nthe power stage VDD 5V power supply is enabled prior to VCC, supply, TI recommends to control the power\nstage enable pin to be low until both supply voltages are established.\nTPS53676 voltage and current protections become active when the controller VCC supply is powered. TI\nrecommends the VCC voltage be powered first, prior to power stage 5V, or VIN_CSNIN/CSPIN voltages. In\ngeneral, TI recommends to assert the AVR_EN/BVR_EN pins last in the power sequence.\nOther sequences are permissible, but may not be able to make use of the controller protection features. For\nexample, if a board assembly issue causes the power input supply (e.g. nominally 12V supply) to charge the\noutput voltage, the TPS53676 over-voltage protection can protect the load device by forcing the PWM pins low,\ncausing the power stage devices to discharge the output voltage, but only if the VCC supply is established by the\ntime the power input voltage rises.www.ti.comTPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 129\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\n10 Layout\nProper layout techniques are critical to power supply performance. The recommendations given in this document\nare meant to minimize risk and give the highest possibility of first pass success. Other layout designs are\npossible but may carry higher risk of performance issues. Contact your TI local field/sales representative for\nin-depth guidance and layout reviews.\nThe driverless controller architecture makes it easy to separate noisy driver interface lines from sensitive\ncontroller signals. Because the power stage is external to the device, all gate drive and switch node traces must\nbe local to the inductor and power stages.\nController Layout Guidelines\n• Keep minimum 800 mil distance between the controller and the closest power stage\n• Ensure the controller and all power stages must share a common ground plane\n• Route CSPx /VREF differentially from controller to IOUT/REFIN pin of each power stages on a quiet inner\nlayer. Alternately, create a small VREF copper plane between controller and power stages, and embed the\nCSPx traces inside VREF plane.\n• PWMx must be routed on a different quiet inner layer and not on the same layer next to CSPx/VREF\ndifferential pairs.\nNote\nMOST IMPORTANT LAYOUT RECOMMENDATION: Must keep min 40mil clearance between 12Vin\ncopper/vias/traces and sensitive analog interface lines.\nPower stage layout guidelines\n• Use the recommended land and via pattern for power stage footprint\n• Make layer 2 on the PCB stack a solid ground plane\n• Maximize the phase pitch between adjacent phases whenever possible to prevent any cross-coupling noise\nbetween devices (9 mm or higher is preferred)\n• In cases where the phase pitch is tighter, adjust the controller phase firing order to minimize noise coupling\nbetween devices.\n• The input voltage bypass capacitors require a minimum two vias per pad(for both Vin and GND)\n• Place additional GND vias along the sides of device as space allows\n• For multi-phase systems, ensure that the GND pour connects all phases.\n• Connect the VOS pin feedback point to the inner edge of the inductor output pad.\n• Place VDD and PVDD bypass capacitors directly next to pins on the same layer of the device.TPS53676\nSLUSDP0A – AUGUST 2019 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n130 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS53676\nLayout example\nFigure 10-1.
