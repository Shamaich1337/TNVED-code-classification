Total supply\ncurrent is typically 50 µA at full load (20 to 60 times\nlower than in bipolar regulators).\nThe devices’ key features include ultra low-noise\noperation (plus optional Bypass input), fast response to\nstep changes in load, and very low dropout voltage,\ntypically 85 mV (TC1014), 180 mV (TC1015), and270 mV (TC1185) at full-load. Supply current is\nreduced to 0.5 µA (max) and V\nOUT falls to zero when\nthe shutdown input is low. The devices incorporate bothovertemperature and overcurrent protection.\nThe TC1014/TC1015/TC1185 are stable with an output\ncapacitor of only 1 µF and have a maximum output\ncurrent of 50 mA, 100 mA and 150 mA, respectively.For higher output current regulators, please see the\nTC1107 (DS21356), TC1108 (DS21357), TC1173\n(DS21362) (I\nOUT = 300 mA) data sheets.\nPackage Type  \nTC1014\nTC1015TC1185V\nOUT\nSHDNGND\nBypass\n470 pF\nReference\nBypass Cap\n(Optional)1µ F  +VIN VIN VOUT1 5\n2\n4 3\nShutdown Control\n(from Power Control Logic)Bypass\nSHDN55-Pin SOT-23\nTC1014\nTC1015\nTC1185\n134\n2\nVINVOUT\nGND50 mA, 100 mA and 150 mA CMOS LDOs with Shutdown \nand Reference Bypass\nTC1014/TC1015/TC1185\nDS21335E-page 2 © 2007 Microchip Technology Inc.1.0 ELECTRICAL \nCHARACTERISTICS\nAbsolute Maximum Ratings†\nInput Voltage .........................................................6.5V\nOutput Voltage...........................

Like all low dropout linear regulators, lowsource impedance is ne cessary for the stable\noperation of the LDO. The amount of capacitancerequired to ensure lo w source impedance will\ndepend on the proximity of the input sourcecapacitors or battery type. For most applications,1.0 µF of capacitance will ensure stable operationof the LDO circuit. The type of capacitor used canbe ceramic, tantalum or aluminum electrolytic.The low Effective Series Resistance (ESR) char-acteristics of the ceramic will yield better noiseand Power Supply Ripple Rejection (PSRR)performance at high frequency.\n3.2 Ground Terminal (GND)\nConnect the ground pin to the input voltagereturn. For the optimal noise and PSRRperformance, the GND pin of the LDO should betied to a quiet circuit ground. For applicationshave switching or noisy inputs tie the GND pin tothe return of the output capacitor. Ground planeshelp lower inductance an d voltage spikes caused\nby fast transient load currents and arerecommended for applications that are subjectedto fast load transients.3.3 Shutdown (SHDN )\nThe Shutdown input is used to turn the LDO onand off. When the SHDN\n pin is at a logic high\nlevel, the LDO output is enabled. When theSHDN\n pin is pulled to a logic low, the LDO output\nis disabled. When disabled, the quiescent currentused by the LDO is less than 0.5 µA max.\n3.4 Bypass\nConnecting a low-value ce ramic capacitor to the\nBypass pin will further reduce output voltage\nnoise and improve the PSRR performance of theLDO. While smaller and larger values can be\nused, these affect the speed at which the LDOoutput voltage rises when the input power is\napplied. The larger the bypass capacitor, the\nslower the output voltage will rise.\n3.5 Output Voltage (VOUT)\nConnect the output load to VOUT of the LDO. Also\nconnect one side of the LDO output capacitor asclose as possible to the V\nOUT pin.Pin No.\n(5-Pin SOT-23)Symbol Description\n1VIN Unregulated supply input.\n2 GND Ground terminal.3 SHDN\nShutdown control input.

Unlike bipolar regulators, theTC1014, TC1015 and TC1185 supply current does not\nincrease with load current. In addition, the LDOs’ out-\nput voltage is stable using 1 µF of capacitance over the\nentire specified input volt age range and output current\nrange.\nFigure 4-1  shows a typical application circuit. The\nregulator is enabled anytime the shutdown input\n(SHDN\n) is at or above VIH, and disabled when SHDN is\nat or below VIL. SHDN  may be controlled by a CMOS\nlogic gate or I/O port of a microcontroller. If the SHDN\ninput is not required, it should be connected directly tothe input supply. While in shutdown, the supply currentdecreases to 0.05 µA (typical) and V\nOUT falls to zero\nvolts.\nFIGURE 4-1: Typical Application Circuit.4.1 Bypass Input\nA 470 pF capacitor connected from the Bypass input to\nground reduces noise present on the internal\nreference, which in turn, significantly reduces outputnoise. If output noise is not a concern, this input may be\nleft unconnected. Larger capacitor values may be\nused, but results in a longer time period to rated output\nvoltage when power is initially applied.\n4.2 Output Capacitor\nA 1 µF (min) capacitor from VOUT to ground is required.\nThe output capacitor should have an effective seriesresistance greater than 0.1 Ω and less than 5 Ω. A 1 µF\ncapacitor should be connected from V\nIN to GND if there\nis more than 10 inches of wire between the regulatorand the AC filter capacitor, or if a battery is used as the\npower source. Aluminum electrolytic or tantalum\ncapacitor types can be used. (Since many aluminumelectrolytic capacitors free ze at approximately -30°C,\nsolid tantalums are recommended for applications\noperating below -25°C.) When operating from sourcesother than batteries, s upply-noise rejection and\ntransient response can be improved by increasing the\nvalue of the input and out put capacitors and employing\npassive filtering techniques.\n4.3 Input Capacitor\nA 1 µF capacitor should be connected from VIN to GND\nif there is more than 10 inches of wire between the\nregulator and this AC filter capacitor, or if a battery isused as the power source. Aluminum electrolytic or\ntantalum capacitors can be used (since many\naluminum electrolytic capacitors freeze atapproximately -30°C, solid  tantalum is recommended\nfor applications operating below -25°C). When\noperating from sources othe r than batteries, supply-\nnoise rejection and transient response can be\nimproved by increasing the value of the input and\noutput capacitors and employing passive filteringtechniques.TC1014\nTC1015\nTC1185VOUT\nSHDNGND\nBypass\n470 pF\nReference\nBypass Cap(Optional)+V\nIN VOUT\nShutdown Control\n(to CMOS Logic or Tie\nto VIN if unused)1µ F+\nBattery+ 1µ F\n© 2007 Microchip Technology Inc.

The following equation is used to\ncalculate worst-case actual power dissipation:\nEQUATION 5-1:\nThe maximum allowable power dissipation\n(Equation 5-2 ) is a function of the maximum ambient\ntemperature (TAMAX), the maximum allowable die\ntemperature (TJMAX) and the thermal resistance from\njunction-to-air ( θJA). The 5-pin SOT-23 package has a\nθJA of approximately 220°C/Watt.\nEQUATION 5-2:Equation 5-1  can be used in conjunction with\nEquation 5-2  to ensure regulator thermal operation is\nwithin limits. For example:\nGiven:\nFind:\n1. Actual power dissipation\n2. Maximum allowable dissipation\nActual power dissipation:P\nD ≈ (VINMAX – VOUT MIN)ILOAD MAX\n= [(3.0 x 1.1) – (2.7 x .975)]40 x 10–3\n= 26.7 mW\nMaximum allowable power dissipation:\nIn this example, the TC1014 dissipates a maximum of\n26.7 mW below the allowable limit of 318 mW. In a\nsimilar manner, Equation 5-1  and Equation 5-2  can be\nused to calculate maximum current and/or inputvoltage limits.\n5.3 Layout Considerations\nThe primary path of heat conduction out of the package\nis via the package leads. Therefore, layouts having a\nground plane, wide traces at the pads, and wide powersupply bus lines combine to lower θ\nJA and therefore\nincrease the maximum allowable power dissipation\nlimit.PDVINMAXVOUTMIN– () ILOADMAX≈\nWhere:\nPD= Worst-case actual power \ndissipation\nVINMAX = Maximum voltage on VIN\nVOUTMIN = Minimum regulator output voltage\nILOADMAX = Maximum output (load) current\nWhere all terms are previously defined.PDMAXTJMAXTAMAX–()\nθJA------------------------------------------- - =VINMAX =3 . 0 V  + 1 0 %\nVOUT MIN = 2.7V – 2.5%\nILOAD MAX =4 0 m A\nTJMAX =1 2 5 ° C\nTAMAX =5 5 ° C\nPDMAXTJMAXTAMAX–()\nθJA------------------------------------------- - =\n125 55–()\n220-------------------------=\n318 mW=\nTC1014/TC1015/TC1185\nDS21335E-page 14 © 2007 Microchip Technology Inc.6.0 PACKAGING INFORMATION\n6.1 Package Marking Information\n6.2 Taping Formc&drepresents part number code + temperature \nrange and voltage \ne represents year an d 2-month period code\nf represents lot ID number1423TABLE 6-1: PART NUMBER CODE AND \nTEMPERATURE RANGE\n(V)TC1014\nCodeTC1015\nCodeTC1185\nCode\n1.8 AY BY NY\n2.5 A1 B1 N1\n2.6 NB BT NT\n2.7 A2 B2 N22.8 AZ BZ NZ\n2.85 A8 B8 N8\n3.0 A3 B3 N33.3 A5 B5 N5\n3.6 A9 B9 N9\n4.0 A0 B0 N05.0 A7 B7 N7\nW, Width of \nCarrier Tape  User Direction of Feed\nP,Pitch\nStandard Reel Component \nOrientation  Reverse Reel Component \nOrientation  PIN 1Device  \nMarking \nPIN 1 \nCarrier Tape, Number of Components per Reel and Reel Size\nPackage Carrier Width (W) Pitch (P) Part Per Full Reel Reel Size\n5-Pin SOT-23 8 mm 4 mm 3000 7 in\n© 2007 Microchip Technology Inc.
