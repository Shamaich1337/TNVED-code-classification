This switch is a pin-compatible four throw version of the \nPE42451 with a wider frequency and power supply range. \nIt is comprised of four symmetric RF ports with very high isolation up to 6 GHz. An integrated CMOS decoder facilitates a two- or three-pin 1.8V CMOS control interface. In addition, no external blocking capacitors are \nrequired if 0 VDC is present on the RF ports. \n The PE42442 is manufactured on pSemi’s UltraCMOS\n® \nprocess, a patented variation of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) \ntechnology on a sapphire substrate. \n pSemi’s HaRP technology enhancements deliver high linearity and excellent harmonics performance. It is an \ninnovative feature of the UltraCMOS process, offering the \nperformance of GaAs with the economy and integration of conventional CMOS. \nDOC-59069 \nProduct Specification PE42442 \nPage  2 of 11 ©2013-2021 pSemi Corporation  All rights reserved.
