This is a \nstress rating only; functional operation of the product at these \nor any other conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may affect product reliability.  \nTHERMAL DATA \nAbsolute  maximum ratings apply individually only, not in \ncombination. The ADM7154 can be damaged when the \njunction temperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature does not guarantee that T\nJ is within the specified \ntemperature limits. In applications with high power dissipation \nand poor thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temper -\nature may need  to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low \nprinted circuit board ( PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum \nambient temperature can exceed the maximum limit provided that the junction temperature is within specification limits. The \njunction temperature (T\nJ) of the device is dependent on the \nambient temperature (T A), the power d issipation of the device \n(PD), and the junction- to-ambient thermal resistance of the \npackage (θ JA). \nMaximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated from the \nambient temperature (T A) and power dissipation (P D) using the \nfollowing formula : \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) Junction -to-ambient thermal resistance (θ JA) of the package is \nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4 -layer PCB . The \njunction -to-ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on \nthe application and PCB layout. In applications where high \nmaximum power dissipation exists, close attention to thermal \nPCB design is required. The value of θ JA can vary, depending on \nPCB material, layout, and environmental conditions. The \nspecified values of θ JA are based on a 4 -layer, 4 in. × 3 in. circuit \nboard. See JE SD51 -7 and JESD51 -9 for detailed information on \nthe board construction.  \nΨJB is the junction -to-board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W . Ψ JB of the package is based on modeling and \ncalcula tion using a 4 -layer PCB . JESD51 -12, Guidelines f or \nReporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information , \nstates that thermal characterization parameters are not the same \nas thermal resistances. Ψ JB measures the component power \nflowing through multiple thermal paths rather than a single path as in thermal resistance, θ\nJB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths \ninclude convection from the top of the package as well as \nradiation from the package, factors that make Ψ JB more useful \nin real -world applications. Maximum junction temperature (T J) \nis calculated from t he PCB temperature (T B) and power \ndissipation (P D) using the formula  \nTJ = TB + (PD × ΨJB) \nSee JESD51 -8 and JESD51- 12 for more detailed information \nabout ΨJB. \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE  \nθJA, θJC, and Ψ JB are specified for the worst case conditions, that \nis, a device soldered in a circuit board for surface -mount \npackages.  \nTable 5.

B | Page 14 of 23 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM7154 is an ultra low noise, high power supply rejection \nratio ( PSRR ) linear regulator  target ing radio frequency ( RF) \napplications.  The input voltage range is 2.3  V to 5.5  V, and it can \ndeliver up to 6 00 mA of load  current. Typical shutdown current \nconsumption is 0. 2 µA at roo m temperature .  \nOptimized for use with 1 0 µF ceramic capacitors, the ADM7154 \nprovides excellent transient performance.  \nVREG\nGNDVOUT VIN\nEN\nREFREF_SENSEREFERENCE\nSHUTDOWNACTIVE\nRIPPLE\nFILTER\nCURRENT-LIMIT,\nTHERMAL\nPROTECT\nOTABYP\n12324-042 \nFigure 42. Simplified Internal Block Diagram  \nInternally, the ADM7154 consists of a reference, an error \namplifier, and a P -channel MOS FET  pass transistor. Output \ncurrent is delivered via the PMOS pass device, which is \ncontrolled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback voltage from the output \nand amplifies the difference. If the feedback voltage is lower \nthan the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is \npulled lower, allowing more current to pass and increasing the output voltage. If the feedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, \nallowing less current to pass and decreasing the output voltage.  By heavily filtering the  refere nce voltage , the ADM7154 is able \nto achieve 1. 5 nV/√Hz output typical from 10 kHz to 1 MHz . \nBecause  the error amplifier is always in unity gain, the output \nnoise is independent of the output voltage.  \nTo maintain very high PSRR over a wide frequency range, the \nADM7154 architecture uses an internal active ripple filter . This \nstage  isolate s the low output noise LDO from noise on the VIN  \npin. The result is that the  PSRR of the ADM7154 is significantly \nhigher over a wider frequency  range than any single stage LDO. \nThe ADM7154 uses the EN  pin to enable and disable the VOUT \npin under normal operating conditions. When EN is high, \nVOUT turns on, and when EN is low , VOUT turns  off. For \nautomatic startup,  tie EN to VIN.  \nVREGVIN\nREF_SENSEREF\nVOUTBYP\nGNDEN\n7V 4V4V\n4V4V\n4V 4V4V\n4V7V\n7V\n12324-043 \nFigure 43.

They are not without faults, however. Depending on the dielectric material, the \ncapacitance can vary dramatically with temperature, dc bias, \nand ac signal level. Therefore , selecting the proper capacitor \nresult s in the best circuit performance.  \nOutput Capacitor  \nThe ADM7154 is designed  for operation with ceramic \ncapacitors but function s with most commonly used capa citors \nwhen  care is taken with regard to  the effective series resistance \n(ESR) value.  The ESR of the output capaci tor affects the stabi lity \nof the LDO control loop . A minimum  of 10 µF capacitance  with \nan ESR of 0.2  Ω or less is recommended to ensure the stability \nof the ADM7154. Output capacitance also affects t ransient \nresponse  to changes in load current . Using a larger value of \noutput capacitance improve s the transient response of the \nADM7154 to large changes in load current. Figure 44 show s the \ntransient responses for an output capacitance value of 1 0 µF. 12324-144CH1  200mA  ΩBW M4µs A  CH1      212mA\nT  10.2%1\nCH2  5mVBW2T\n \nFigure 44. Output Transient Response,  VOUT = 3.3 V, COUT = 10 µF,  \nCH1 = Load Current, CH2 = V OUT  \n \n Input  and  VREG  Capacitor  \nConnecting a 1 0 µF capacitor from V IN to GND reduces the \ncircuit  sensitivity to PCB layout, especially when long input \ntraces or high source impedance are  encountered.  \nTo maintain the best possible stability and PSRR performance, \nconnect a 10 µF capacitor  from VREG to GND. When more  \nthan 10 µF of output capacitance is required, increase the input \nand the VREG capacitor s, C REG, to match  it. \nREF Capacitor  \nThe REF capacitor , C REF, is necessary to stabilize  the reference \namplifier . Connect a t least a 1 µF capacitor between REF and GND.  \nBYP Capacitor  \nThe BYP capacitor , C BYP, is necessary to filter the reference \nbuffer . A 1 µF capacitor  is typically connected between BYP and \nGND.  Capacitors as small as 0.1 µF can  be used ; however,  the \noutput noise voltage of the LDO increase s as a result.  \nIn addition, t he BYP capacitor value can be increase d to reduce \nthe noise  below 1  kHz at the expense of increasing the start -up \ntime of the LDO.  Very large values of C BYP significantly reduce \nthe noise below 10  Hz. Tantalum capacitors are recommended \nfor capacitors larger than approximately  33 µF because solid \ntantalum capacitors are less prone to microphonic noise issues. A 1 μF ceramic capacitor  in parallel with the larger tantalum \ncapacitor  is recommended t o ensu re good noise performance at \nhigher frequencies.

Noise Spectral Density vs . Frequency  at  \nDifferent Capacitances  (CBYP) \nCapacitor Properties  \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the \nADM7154 if they meet the minimum capacitance and  maxi -\nmum  ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured \nwith a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over \ntemperature and applied voltage. C apacitors  must have a \ndielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over \nthe necessary tempera ture range  and dc bias conditions . X5R \nor X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of 6.3 V to  50 V \nare recommended. However, Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are \nnot recommended because of  their poor temperature and dc \nbias characteristics.  \nFigure 47 depicts the capacitance vs . dc bias voltage of a 1206, \n10 µF, 10  V , X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a capacitor is \nstrongly influenced by the capa citor size and voltage rating. In \ngeneral, a capacitor in a larger packag e or higher voltage rating \nexhibit s better stability. The temperature variation of the X5R \ndielectric is ~ ±15% over the − 40°C  to +85°C  temperature range \nand is not a function of packa ge or voltage rating.

The tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed \nto be 10%, and C BIAS is 9.72 µ F at 5  V, as shown in Figure 47. \nSubstituting these values in Equation 1 yields  \nCEFF = 9.72 µF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 7.44 µF \nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the \nminimum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temperature and tolerance at the chosen output voltage.  \nTo guarantee the performance of the  ADM7154, it is imperative \nthat the effects of dc bias, temperature, and toler ances on the \nbehavior of the capacitors b e evaluated for each  application.  \nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT  (UVLO)  \nThe ADM7154 also incorporates an internal UVLO  circuit to \ndisable the output voltage when the input voltage is less than the minimum  input voltage rating of the regulator .

Typical Start -Up Behavior with C BYP = 10 µF to 330  µF \nREF, BYP, AND VREG PINS \nREF, BYP , and VREG generate voltages internally ( VREF, VBYP, \nand V REG) that require  external bypass capacitors for proper \noperation.  Do not , under any circumstances , connect any loads \nto these pins , because  doing so compromise s the noise and \nPSRR performance of the ADM7154. Using larger values of \nCBYP, C REF, and C REG is acceptable but can increase the start -up \ntime , as described in the S tart-Up Time section.  \nCURRENT -LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD  \nPROTECTION  \nThe ADM7154 is protected against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by current and thermal overload protection \ncircuits . The ADM7154 is designed to current limit  when the \noutput  load reaches  960 mA (typical).  When the output load \nexceeds 960 mA, the output voltage is reduced to  maintain a \nconstant current limit.  \nThermal  overload protection is included , which limit s the \njunction  temperature to a maximum of 150°C . Under extreme \nconditions (that is, high ambient temperature and /or high \npower dissipation) , when  the junction  temperature starts to rise \nabove 15 0°C, the output is turned off , reduc ing the output \ncurrent to zero. When the junction temperature drops below \n135°C , the output is turned on again , and the output current is \nrestored to the operating  value . \nConsider the case where a hard  short from V OUT to GND  \noccurs. At first, the ADM7154 current limit s, so that only \n960 mA is conducted into the short. If self heating of the \njunction is great enough to cause  the temperature to rise above \n150°C, thermal shutdown  activ ates, turning off the output and \nreducing the output current to zero. As the junction tempera -\nture cools and drops below 1 35°C, the output turn s on and \nconduct s 900 mA into the short, again caus ing the junction \ntemperature to rise above 15 0°C. This  thermal oscillation \nbetween 1 35°C and 150°C cause s a current oscillation between \n900 mA and 0  mA that continue s for as long as the short \nremains at the output.  Current -limit and thermal limit protections are intended to \nprotect the device against accidenta l overload conditions. For \nreliable  operation, device power dissipation must  be externally \nlimited so that the junction temperature do es not exceed 15 0°C. \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIO NS \nIn applications with a low input  to output voltage differential , \nthe ADM7154 does not dissi pate much heat. However, in \napplications with high a mbient temperature and/or high input \nvoltage, the heat dis sipated in the package can  become large \nenough that it cause s the junction temperature of the die to \nexceed the maximum junction temperature of 1 50°C. \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 15 0°C, the converter \nenters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction \ntemperature decreases below 1 35°C to prevent any permanent \ndamage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is important to guarantee reliable performance over all condi -\ntions. The junction temperature of the die is the sum of the \nambient temperature of the environment and the temperature \nrise of the package due to the power dissipation, as shown in \nEquation 2.  \nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the ADM7154 must not exceed 15 0°C. To ensure that the juncti on \ntemperature stays below this maximum value, the user must  be \naware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature \nchanges. These parameters include ambient temperature, power \ndissipation in the power device, and thermal resistances between \nthe junction and ambient air (θ\nJA). The θ JA number is dependent \non the package assembly compounds that are used and the \namount of copper used to solder the package GND pi n and \nexposed pad  to the PCB.  \nTable 7 shows typical θ JA values of the 8 -lead SOIC and 8 -lead \nLFCSP packages for various PCB copper sizes.  \nTable 8 shows the typical Ψ JB values of the 8 -lead SOIC and  \n8-lead LFCSP .  \nTable 7.

B | Page 19 of 23 The junction temperature of the ADM7154 is calculated from \nthe following equation:  \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) (2) \nwhere:  \nTA is the ambient temperature.  \nPD is the power dissipation in the die, given by  \nPD = ((VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD) + (VIN × IGND) (3) \nwhere:  \nVIN and VOUT are the input and output voltages, respectively.  \nILOAD is the load current.  \nIGND is the ground current.  \nPower dissipation caused by  ground current is quite small and \ncan be ignored. Therefore, the junction temperature equ ation \nsimplifies to the following:  \nTJ = TA + ((( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD) × θJA) (4) \nAs shown in Equation 4, for a given ambient temperature, input  \nto output voltage differential, and continuous load current , \nthere exists a minimum copper size requirement for the PCB to \nensure that the junction temperature does not rise above 15 0°C. \nThe heat dissipation from the package can be improved by increasing the amount of copper attached to the pins and exposed pad of the ADM7154. Adding thermal planes \nunder neath  the package also improves thermal performance.  \nHowever, as shown  in Table 7, a point of diminishing returns is \neventually reached, beyond which an increase in the copper \narea does not yield significant reduction in the junction to \nambient thermal resistance.  \nFigure 55 to Figure 60 show junction temperature calculations \nfor different ambient temperatures, power dissipation, and areas of PCB copper.
