The RF port is designed for the 2GHz to \n14GHz band and the IF port is optimized for 500MHz to \n6GHz operation. An integrated LO buffer amplifier supports  \nLO frequencies from 1GHz to 12GHz, requiring only 0dBm \nLO power. The LTC5549 delivers high IIP3 and input P1dB \nwith low power consumption.\nAn internal LO frequency doubler can be enabled by a \nCMOS-compatible digital control pin, allowing operation \nwith a lower, one-half LO input frequency. This allows the \nmixer’s LO port to be used with existing synthesizers, such \nas the LTC6946 and LTC6948 family.The LTC5549’s high level of integration minimizes the total \nsolution cost, board space and system level variation with \nits 2mm × 3mm package size.\nConversion Loss and IIP3\n(Low Side LO, IF = 1890MHz)applica Tions nUpconversion or Downconversion\n nHigh IIP3: +28.2dBm at 5.8GHz \n +22.8dBm at 12GHz\n n8.0dB Conversion Loss at 5.8GHz \n n+14.3dBm Input P1dB at 5.8GHz\n nIntegrated LO Buffer: 0dBm LO Drive\n nBypassable Integrated LO Frequency Doubler\n nLow LO-RF Leakage: <–30dBm\n n50Ω Single-Ended RF , LO and IF Ports\n n3.3V/115mA Supply\n nFast Turn ON/OFF for TDD Operation\n n2mm × 3mm, 12-Lead QFN Package\n nMicrowave T ransceivers\n nWireless Backhaul\n nPoint-to-Point Microwave\n nPhased-Array Antennas\n nC, X and Ku Band RADAR\n nTest Equipment\n nSatellite MODEMsL, LT , LT C , LT M , Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks of Linear \nTechnology Corporation.

See the Block Diagram section \nfor a description of each pin function. The RF, LO and IF \nare single-ended terminals. The LTC5549 can be used \nas a frequency downconverter where the RF is used as \nan input and IF is used as an output. It can also be used \nas a frequency upconverter where the IF is used as an \ninput and RF is used as an output. Low side or high side \nLO injection can be used.

The primary  \nside of the RF transformer is DC-grounded internally and \nthe DC resistance of the primary side is approximately \n3.2Ω. A DC blocking capacitor is needed if the RF source \nhas DC voltage present.

The RF port is 50Ω matched from \n2GHz to 10GHz without C1. An LO signal between –6dBm \nand 6dBm is required for good RF impedance matching. 5549 F02\nLTC554915\n5549fa For more information www.linear .com/L TC5549applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 5. Simplified LO Input Schematic\nFigure 6. LO Input Return Losslimiting differential amplifier and an LO frequency doubler. \nThe LTC5549’s LO amplifier is optimized for the 1GHz \nto 12GHz LO frequency range. LO frequencies above or \nbelow this frequency range may be used with degraded \nperformance. The LO frequency doubler is controlled by \na digital voltage input at X2 (Pin 8). When the X2 voltage \nis higher than 1.2V, the LO frequency doubler is enabled. \nWhen X2 is left open or its voltage is lower than 0.5V, the \nLO frequency doubler is disabled. \nThe mixer’s LO input is connected to a singled-ended to \ndifferential buffer and ESD devices. The DC voltage at the \nLO input is about 1.6V. A DC blocking capacitor is required \nfor the LO circuit to operate properly. \nThe LO is 50Ω matched from 1GHz to 12GHz. With a \n0.15pF shunt capacitor (C4) located 3.55mm away from \nthe LO pin. The LO port is 50Ω matched from 1GHz to \n8.4GHz without C4. External matching components may \nbe needed for extended LO operating frequency range. The measured LO input return loss is shown in Figure 6. \nThe nominal LO input level is 0dBm, although the limiting \namplifiers will deliver\n  excellent performance over a  ±6dBm  \ninput power range.\nIF Port\nThe mixer’s IF port, shown in Figure 7, is connected to the \nprimary winding of an integrated transformer. The primary  \nside of the IF transformer is DC-grounded internally and \nthe DC resistance is approximately 6.2Ω. A DC blocking \ncapacitor is needed if the IF source has DC voltage present. \nThe secondary winding of the IF transformer is internally \nconnected to the mixer core.Figure 7.

To enable  the chip, the EN voltage must be higher \nthan 1.2V. The voltage at the EN pin should never exceed \nVCC by more than 0.3V. If this should occur, the supply \ncurrent could be sourced through the ESD diode, potentially  \ndamaging the IC. If the EN pin is left floating, its voltage \nwill be pulled low by the internal pull-down resistor and the chip will be disabled.\nX2 Interface\nFigure 10 shows a simplified schematic of the X2 pin \ninterface. To enable the integrated LO frequency doubler, \nFigure 9. Simplified Enable Input Circuit Figure 10. Simplified X2 Interface Circuitthe X2 voltage must be higher than 1.2V. The X2 voltage \nat the pin should never exceed V CC by more than 0.3V. If \nthis should occur, the supply current could be sourced \nthrough the ESD diode, potentially damaging the IC. If the \nX2 pin is left floating, its voltage will be pulled low by the \ninternal pull-down resistor and the LO frequency doubler \nwill be disabled.\nSupply Voltage Ramping\nFast ramping of the supply voltage can cause a current \nglitch in the internal ESD protection circuits. Depending on \nthe supply inductance, this could result in a supply volt-\nage \ntransient  that exceeds the maximum rating. A supply \nvoltage ramp time of greater than 1ms is recommended.\nL TC5549\nEN\n5549 F097VCC9\nBIASL TC5549\nX2\n5549 F108VCC9\nLTC554917\n5549fa For more information www.linear .com/L TC5549Typical applica Tion\nDue to the wideband nature of the RF, LO and IF ports, \nthe LTC5549 may be used as an upmixer even when the \nlower (IF) input frequency is applied to the RF port and \nthe higher (RF) output is taken from the IF port.
