Functional Description3.Functional Description 3.1.MCU ESP8266EX integrates a Tensilica L106 32-bit RISC processor, which achieves extra-low power consumption and reaches a maximum clock speed of 160 MHz. The Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) and Wi-Fi stack allow 80% of the processing power to be available for user application programming and development. The CPU includes the interfaces as below. ‚Ä¢Programmable RAM/ROM interfaces (iBus), which can be connected with memory controller, and can also be used to visit Ô¨Çash. ‚Ä¢Data RAM interface (dBus), which can connected with memory controller. ‚Ä¢AHB interface which can be used to visit the register. 3.2.Memory 3.2.1.Internal SRAM and ROM ESP8266EX Wi-Fi SoC integrates memory controller and memory units including SRAM and ROM. MCU can access the memory units through iBus, dBus, and AHB interfaces. All memory units can be accessed upon request, while a memory arbiter will decide the running sequence according to the time when these requests are received by the processor. According to our current version of SDK, SRAM space available to users is assigned as below. ‚Ä¢RAM size < 50 kB, that is, when ESP8266EX is working under the Station mode and connects to the router, programmable space accessible in heap + data section is around 50 kB. ‚Ä¢There is no programmable ROM in the SoC, therefore, user program must be stored in an external SPI Ô¨Çash. 3.2.2.SPI Flash ESP8266EX uses external SPI Ô¨Çash to store user programs, and supports up to 16 MB memory capacity theoretically. ESP-WROOM-02 currently integrates a 2-MB SPI Ô¨Çash. ESP-WROOM-02 supports these SPI modes: Standard SPI, DIO (Dual I/O), DOUT (Dual Output), QIO (Quad I/O) and QOUT (Quad Output).

The accuracy of the crystal oscillator should be ¬±10 PPM. When using the download tool, please select the right type of crystal oscillator. In circuit design, capacitors C1 and C2 which connect to the earth are added to the input and output terminals of the crystal oscillator respectively. The values of the two capacitors can be Ô¨Çexible, ranging from 6 pF to 22 pF, however, the speciÔ¨Åc capacitive values depend on further testing of, and adjustment to, the overall performance of the whole circuit. Normally, the capacitive values of C1 and C2 are within 10 pF for the 26-MHz crystal oscillator. 3.4.Interface Description Table 3-1.

The interface uses NEC coding, modulation, and demodulation. The frequency of the modulated carrier signal is 38 kHz.ADCTOUTTests the power supply voltage of VDD3P3 (Pin3 and Pin4) and the input power voltage of TOUT (Pin6).

By default, UART0 will output some printed information when you power on ESP8266EX. If this issue inÔ¨Çuences some speciÔ¨Åc applications, users can exchange the inner pins of UART when initializing ESP8266EX, that is, exchange U0TXD and U0RXD with U0RTS and U0CTS. Users can connect MTDO and MTCK to the serial port of the external MCU to realize the communication.Espressif #/# 618Submit Documentation FeedbackNot Recommended For New Designs (NRND) 2022.03  \n#\n3.

In cases where Wi-Fi connectivity is maintained and data transmission is not required, the Wi-Fi Modem circuit can be shut down to save power, according to 802.11 standards (such as U-APSD). For example, in DTIM3, when ESP8266EX sleeps for 300 ms and wakes up for 3 ms to receive Beacon packages from AP , the overall average current consumption is about 15 mA. ‚ë°Light-sleep is used for applications whose CPU may be suspended, such as Wi-Fi switch. In cases where Wi-Fi connectivity is maintained and data transmission is not required, Wi-Fi Modem circuit and CPU can be shut down to save power, according to 802.11 standards (such as U-APSD). For example, in DTIM3, when ESP8266EX sleeps for 300 ms and wakes up for 3 ms to receive Beacon packages from AP , the overall average current consumption is about 0.9 mA. ‚ë¢Deep-sleep is for applications that do not require Wi-Fi connectivity and only transmit data over long time lags, e.g., a temperature sensor that measures temperature every 100 s. For example, when ESP8266EX sleeps for 300 s then wakes up to connect to AP (taking about 0.3 ~ 1 s), the overall average current consumption is far less than 1 mA. The current consumption of 20 ŒºA was obtained at the voltage of 2.5 V.\n501500251 ~ 3‚ÑÉ/s\n0200250\n200-1 ~ -5‚ÑÉ/sCooling zone\n100217\n50100250ReÔ¨Çow zone !217‚ÑÉ  60 ~ 90sTemperature (‚ÑÉ)\nPreheating zone150 ~ 200‚ÑÉ        60 ~ 120sRamp-up zonePeak Temp. 235 ~ 250‚ÑÉSoldering time> 30s\nTime (sec.)Ramp-up zone ‚Äî Temp.: <150‚ÑÉ  Time: 60 ~ 90s  Ramp-up rate: 1 ~ 3‚ÑÉ/sPreheating zone ‚Äî Temp.: 150 ~ 200‚ÑÉ  Time: 60 ~ 120s  Ramp-up rate: 0.3 ~ 0.8‚ÑÉ/sReÔ¨Çow zone ‚Äî Temp.: >217‚ÑÉ  7LPH\x1d\x0360 ~ 90s; Peak Temp.: 235 ~ 250‚ÑÉ (<245‚ÑÉ recommended)  Time: 30 ~ 70sCooling zone ‚Äî Peak Temp. ~ 180‚ÑÉ  Ramp-down rate: -1 ~ -5‚ÑÉ/sSolder ‚Äî Sn&Ag&Cu Lead-free solder (SAC305)\nEspressif #/# 1018Submit Documentation FeedbackNot Recommended For New Designs (NRND) 2022.03  \n#\n4.

If users do want to solder it, they need to ensure that the correct quantity of soldering paste is applied. 2.To ensure the power supply to the ESP8266EX chip during the power-up, it is advised to add an RC delay circuit at the EN pin. The recommended setting for the RC delay circuit is usually R = 10 kŒ© and C = 0.1 uF. However, speciÔ¨Åc parameters should be adjusted based on the power-up timing of the module and the power-up and reset timing of the ESP8266 chip. For ESP8266EX‚Äôs Power-up and Reset Timing Diagram, please refer to Electrical Characteristics in ESP8266EX Datasheet. 3.To improve module‚Äôs anti-inference capability, it is advised to reserve an RC delay circuit at the RST pin.
