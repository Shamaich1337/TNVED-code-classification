General description\nThe PCA9535 and PCA9535C are 24-pin CMOS devices that provide 16 bits of General \nPurpose parallel Input/Output (GPIO) expansion for I2C-bus/SMBus applications and was \ndeveloped to enhance the NXP Semiconductors family of I2C-bus I/O expanders. The \nimprovements include higher dr ive capability, 5 V I/O tolera nce, lower supply current, \nindividual I/O configuration, and smaller pa ckaging. I/O expanders provide a simple \nsolution when additional I/O is needed for ACPI power switches, sensors, push buttons, \nLEDs, fans, etc.\nThe PCA9535 and PCA9535C consist of two 8-bit Configuration (Input or Output \nselection), Input, Output and Polarity Inve rsion (active HIGH or active LOW operation) \nregisters. The system master can enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to \nthe I/O configuration bits. The data for each input or output is kept in the corresponding \nInput or Output register. The polarity of the read register can be inverted with the Polarity \nInversion register. All registers can be read by the system master. Although pin-to-pin and I\n2C-bus address compatible with the PCF8575, software changes are required due to the \nenhancements and are discussed in Application Note AN469 .\nThe PCA9535 is identical to the PCA9555 ex cept for the removal of the internal I/O \npull-up resistor which greatly reduces power consumption when the I/Os are held LOW.\nThe PCA9535C is identical to the PCA9535 except that all the I/O pins are \nhigh-impedance open-drain outputs.\nThe PCA9535 and PCA9535C open-drain interr upt output is activated when any input \nstate differs from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the \nsystem master that an input state has changed. The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values and initia lizes the device state machine.\nThree hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) vary the fixed I\n2C-bus address and allow up to eight \ndevices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus. The fixed I2C-bus address of the PCA9535 \nand PCA9535C are the same as the PCA9555 allo wing up to eight of these devices in any \ncombination to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus.\n2.

If a bit in this register is set (written \nwith ‘1’), the corresponding port pin is enabl ed as an input with high-impedance output \ndriver. If a bit in this register is cleared (wri tten with ‘0’), the corresponding port pin is \nenabled as an output. At reset, the device\'s ports are inputs.\n \n \n6.3 Power-on reset\nWhen power is applied to V DD, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9535/PCA9535C \nin a reset condition until V DD has reached V POR. At that point, the reset condition is \nreleased and the PCA9535/PC A9535C registers a nd SMBus state machine will initialize \nto their default states. Thereafter, V DD must be lowered below 0. 2 V to reset the device.\nFor a power reset cycle, V DD must be lowered below 0.2 V and then restored to the \noperating voltage.\n6.4 I/O port\nWhen an I/O is configured as an input on PCA9535, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, creating a \nhigh impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above V DD to a maximum of 5.5 V. \nIn the case of PCA9535C, FET Q1 has be en removed and the open-drain FET Q2 will \nfunction the same as PCA9535.\nIf the I/O is configured as an output, then on  PCA9535 either Q1 or Q2 is on, depending \non the state of the Output Port register. Care should be exercised if an external voltage is \napplied to an I/O configured as an output bec ause of the low-impedance path that exists \nbetween the pin and either V DD or V SS.Table 11.

The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register will \nreceive the data following the command byte.\nThe eight registers within the PCA9535/PCA953 5C are configured to operate as four \nregister pairs. The four pairs are Input Ports,  Output Ports, Polarity Inversion Ports, and \nConfiguration Ports. After send ing data to one register, the ne xt data byte will be sent to \nthe other register in the pair (see Figure 8  and Figure 9 ). For example, if the first byte is \nsent to Output Port 1 (register 3), then the next byte will be stored in Output Port 0 \n(register 2). There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write \ntransmission. In this way, each 8-bit regist er may be updated independently of the other \nregisters.At power-on reset, all registers return to default values.\n(1) PCA9535C I/Os are open-drain only.

The command byte is sent after the address and \ndetermines which register will be accessed. Afte r a restart, the devi ce address is sent \nagain, but this time the least significant bit is set to a logic 1. Data from the register \ndefined by the command byte will then be sent by the PCA9535/PCA9535C (see \nFigure 10 , Figure 11  and Figure 12 ). Data is clocked into the register on the falling edge of \nthe acknowledge clock pulse. After the first byte  is read, additional bytes may be read but \nthe data will now reflect the informa tion in the other register in the pair. For example, if you \nread Input Port 1, then the next byte read would be Input Port 0. There is no limitation on \nthe number of data bytes received in one read transmission but the final byte received, the \nbus master must not acknowledge the data.\n \nRemark: Transfer can be stopped at any time by a STOP condition.\nFig 10.

The interr upt is deactivated when the input returns to its \nprevious state or the Input Port register is read (see Figure 11 ). A pin configured as an \noutput cannot cause an interrup t. Since each 8-bit port is read independently, the interrupt \ncaused by Port 0 will not be cleared by a read of Port 1 or the other way around.\nRemark: Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur \nif the state of the pin does not match th e contents of the Input Port register.\n7. Characteristics of the I2C-bus\nThe I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two \nlines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be \nconnected to a positive supply via a pull-up re sistor when connected to the output stages \nof a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\n7.1 Bit transfer\nOne data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain \nstable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 13\n).\n \n7.1.1 START and STOP conditions\nBoth data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW \ntransition of the data line while the clock is HI GH is defined as the START condition (S). A \nLOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP \ncondition (P) (see Figure 14 ).\n Fig 13.

The \ndevice that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by \nthe master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 15 ).\n \n7.3 Acknowledge\nThe number of data bytes transferred betwe en the START and the STOP conditions from \ntransmitter to receiver is not limited. Ea ch byte of eight bits is followed by one \nacknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter, \nwhereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.\nA slave receiver which is addressed must gen erate an acknowledge af ter the reception of \neach byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte \nthat has been clocked out of the slave transm itter. The device that acknowledges has to \npull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable \nLOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold \ntime must be taken into account.\nA master receiver must signal an end of da ta to the transmitter by not generating an \nacknowledge on the last byte that has been cloc ked out of the slave. In this event, the \ntransmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP \ncondition.\n Fig 15.

Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is \noff the I/O V I is about 1.2 V less than V DD. The supply current, I DD, increases as V I \nbecomes lower than V DD.\nDesigns needing to minimize current consumpt ion, such as battery power applications, \nshould consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to V DD when the LED is off. \nFigure 18  shows a high value resistor  in parallel with the LED. Figure 19  shows V DD less \nthan the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O V I \nat or above V DD and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.\nThis concern does not occur in the case of PCA9535C because the I/O pins are \nopen-drain.\n \n9.

Handling information\nInputs and outputs are protected against el ectrostatic discharge in normal handling. \nHowever, to be completely safe you must take normal precautions appropriate to handling \nintegrated circuits.\n15. Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n15.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not \nsuitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n15.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from \na standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, \nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n15.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\nPCA9535_PCA9535C All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2017.

It is imperative that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 16  and 17\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 29 .Table 16.
