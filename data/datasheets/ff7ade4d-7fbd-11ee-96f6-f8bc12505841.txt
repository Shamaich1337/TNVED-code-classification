It consists of a low noise \ndigital phase frequency detector (PFD), a precision charge \npump, a programmable reference divider, and programmable  N divider. The 14 -bit referen ce counter (R  counter)  allows \nselectable REFIN frequencies at the PFD input. A complete phase -locked loop (PLL) can be implemented if the synthesizer \nis used with an external loop filter and voltage controlled \noscillator (VCO). In addition, by programming R and N to 1, \nthe device  can be used as a standalone PFD and charge pump.  \n \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM  \nCLK\nDATA\nLEREF IN\nRFINA\nRFINB24-BIT INPUT\nREGISTER\nSDOUTAVDD DVDD\nCE AGND DGND14-BIT\nR COUNTER\nR COUNTER\nLATCH\n2214\nFUNCTION\nLATCH\nN COUNTER\nLATCH\n13-BIT\nN COUNTER\nM3M2M1MUX\nSDOUTAVDDHIGH Z\nMUXOUTCPGND RSET VP\nCPPHASE\nFREQUENC Y\nDETEC TOR\nLOCK\nDETECTREFERENCE\nCHARGE\nPUM P\nCURRENT\nSETTING 1\nADF4002CPI3 CPI2 CPI1 CPI6 CPI5 CPI4CURRENT\nSETTING 2\n06052-001 \nFigure 1. \n \nADF4002 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

The \nnominal voltage potential at the RSET pin is 0.66 V. The relationship between  ICP and RSET is \nSETMAXCPRI25.5=  \nwhere RSET = 5.1 kΩ and I CP MAX  = 5 mA.  \n2 20 CP Charge Pump Output. When enabled, this provides ±I CP to the external loop filter that, in turn, drives the \nexternal VCO.  \n3 1 CPGND  Charge Pump Ground. This is the grou nd return path for the charge pump.  \n4 2, 3 AGND  Analog Ground. This is the ground return path of the RF input.  \n5 4 RF INB Complementary Input to the RF Input. This point must be decoupled to the ground plane with a small bypass capacitor, typically 100  pF. See Figure 11. \n6 5 RF INA Input to the RF Input. This small signal input is ac -coupled to the external VCO.  \n7 6, 7 AV DD Analog Power Supply. This can range from 2.7 V to 3.3 V. Decoupling capacitors to the analog ground plane should be placed as close as possible to the AV\nDD pin. AV DD must be the same value as DV DD. \n8 8 REF IN Reference Input. This is a CMOS input with a nominal threshold of V DD/2 and a dc equivalent input \nresistance of 100 kΩ. See Figure 10. This input can be driven from a TTL or CMOS crystal oscillator or it can \nbe ac -coupled.  \n9 9, 10  DGND  Digital Ground.  \n10 11 CE Chip Enable. A logic low on this pin powers down the device and puts the charge pump output into three -\nstate mode. Taki ng this pin high powers up the device, depending on the status of the Power-Down Bit F2.  \n11 12 CLK  Serial Clock Input. This serial clock is used to clock in the serial data to the registers. The data is latched  into \nthe 24-bit shift register on the CLK rising edge. This input is a high impedance CMOS input.  \n12 13 DATA  Serial Data Input . The serial data is loaded MSB first with the two LSBs being the control bits. This input is a \nhigh impedance CMOS input.  \n13 14 LE Load Enable, CMOS Input. When LE goes hi gh, the data stored in the shift registers is loaded into one of \nthe four latches; the latch is selected using the control bits.  \n14 15 MUXOUT  Multiplexer Output. This allows either the lock detect, the scaled RF, or the scaled reference frequency to \nbe ac cessed externally.  \n15 16, 17 DV DD Digital Power Supply. This can range from 2.7 V to 3.3 V. Decoupling capacitors to the digital ground plane \nshould be placed as close as possible to this pin. DV DD must be the same value as AV DD. \n16 18 VP Charge Pump Pow er Supply. This should be greater than or equal to V DD. In systems where V DD is 3 V, it can \nbe set to 5.5 V and used to drive a VCO with a tuning range of up to 5 V.  \n  EP Exposed Pad.

The equation for the VCO frequency is  \nRfN fREFIN\nVCO×=  \nwhere:  \nfVCO is the output frequency of external voltage controlled \noscillator (VCO).  \nN is the preset divide ratio of binary 13 -bit counter (1 to 8191).  \nfREFIN is the external reference frequency oscillator.  \nTO PFDFROM RF\nINPUT STAGEFROM N\nCOUNTER LATCH\n13-BIT N\nCOUNTER\n06052-021 \nFigure 12.

Division ratios from 1 to 16,383 are \nallowed.  \nPHASE FREQUENCY DETE CTOR (PFD) AND \nCHARGE PUMP  \nThe PFD takes inputs from the R counter and N counter and produces an output proportional to the phase and frequency difference between them. Figure 13 is a simplified schematic. \nThe PFD includes a programmable delay element that controls \nthe width of the antibacklash pulse. This pulse ensures that \nthere is no dead zone in the PFD transfer function, and minimizes phase noise and refere nce spurs. Two bits in the \nreference counter latch (ABP2 and ABP1) control the width of the pulse. See Figure 16 for details. The smallest antibacklash \npulse width is not recommended.  \nHI\nHID1\nD2Q1\nQ2CLR1\nCLR2CPU1\nU2UP\nDOWNABP2 ABP1\nCPGNDU3R DIVIDER\nPROGRAMMABLE\nDELAY\nN DIVIDERVP\nCHARGE\nPUM P\n06052-023 \nFigure 13.

MUXOUT Circuit  \nLock De tect  \nMUXOUT can be programmed for two types of lock detect: digital lock detect and analog lock detect. \nDigital lock detect is active high. When LDP in the R counter \nlatch is set to 0, digital lock detect is set high when the phase \nerror on three consecuti ve phase detector (PD) cycles is less \nthan 15  ns. With LDP set to 1, five consecutive cycles of less \nthan 15  ns are required to set the lock detect. It stays set at high \nuntil a phase error of greater than 25  ns is detected on any \nsubsequent PD cycle. For PFD frequencie s greater than 10 MHz, analog lock detect is more accurate because of the smaller pulse \nwidths.  \nThe N -channel, open- drain, analog lock detect should be \noperated with an external pull -up resistor of 10  kΩ nominal. \nWhen lock has been detected , this output is high with narrow, \nlow going pulses.  \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER  \nThe ADF4002 digital section includes a 24 -bit input shift \nregister, a 14 -bit R counter, and a 13 -bit N counter. Data is  \nclocked into the 24 -bit shift register on each rising edge of CLK. \nThe data is clocked in MSB  first. Data is transferred from the \nshift register to one of four latches on the rising edge of LE. The \ndestination latch is determined by the state of the two c ontrol \nbits (C2, C1) in the shift register. These are the two LSBs, DB1 and DB0, as shown in the timing diagram (see Figure 2).

Initialization Latch Map \nData Sheet  ADF4002  \n \nRev. D | Page 15 of 20 FUNCTION LATCH  \nWith C2, C1 set to 1, 0, the on -chip function latch is \nprogrammed. Figure 18 shows the input data format for \nprogramming the function latch.  \nCounter Reset  \nDB2 (F1) is the counter reset bit. When this bit is set to 1, the \nR counter and the N counter  are reset. For normal operation, \nset this bit to 0. Upon powering up, the  F1 bit needs to be \ndisabled (set to 0). Then, the N counter resumes counting in close alignment with the R counter (the maximum error is one prescaler cycle).  \nPower -Down  \nDB3 (PD1) and DB21 (PD2) provide programmable power -\ndown modes. These bits are enable d by the CE pin.  \nWhen the CE pin is low, the device is immediately disabled regardless of the states of the PD2, PD1 bits.  \nIn the programmed asynchronous power -down, the device \npowers down immediately after latching a 1 into Bit PD1, with the condition tha t Bit PD2 has been loaded with a 0.  \nIn the programmed synchronous power -down, the device \npower -down is gated by the charge pump to prevent unwanted \nfrequency jumps. Once the power -down is enabled by writing \na 1 into Bit PD1 (on condition that a 1 has also been loaded to \nBit PD2), then the device enters power -down on the occurrence \nof the next charge pump event.  \nWhen a power -down is activated (either in synchronous or \nasynchronous mode, including a CE pin activated power -\ndown), the following events occur: \n• All active dc current paths are removed.  \n• The R, N, and timeout co unters are forced to their load \nstate conditions.  \n• The charge pump is forced into three -state mode.  \n• The digital lock detect circuitry is reset.  \n• The RFIN input is debiased.  \n• The reference input bu ffer circuitry is disabled. \n• The input register remains active and capable of loading \nand latching data.  \nMUXOUT Control  \nThe on -chip multiplexer is controlled by M3, M2, and M1 on \nthe ADF4002. Figure 18 shows the truth table.  \nFastlock Enable Bit  \nDB9 of the function latch is the fastlock enable bit. Only when \nthis is 1 is fastlock enabled. Fastlock Mode Bit  \nDB10 of the function latch is the fastlock mode bit. When \nfastloc k is enabled, this bit determines the fastlock mode to be \nused. If the fastlock mode bit is 0, then Fastlock Mode 1 is selected, and if the fastlock mode bit is 1, then Fastlock Mode 2 \nis selected.  \nFastlock Mode 1  \nIn this mode, the charge pump current is s witched to the \ncontents of Current Setting 2. The device enters fastlock by \nhaving a 1 written to the CP gain bit in the N counter latch. The device exits fastlock by having a  0 written to the CP gain bit in \nthe AB counter latch.  \nFastlock Mode 2  \nIn this mo de, the charge pump current is switched to the \ncontents of Current Setting 2. The device enters fastlock by having a 1 written to the CP gain bit in the N counter latch. The \ndevice exits fastlock under the control of the timer counter. \nAfter the timeout pe riod determined by the value in TC4 to \nTC1, the CP gain bit in the N counter latch is automatically reset to 0 and the device reverts to normal mode instead of fastlock. See Figure 18 for the timeout periods.  \nTimer Counter Control  \nThe user has the option of programming two charge pump \ncurrents. T he intent is to use the Current Setting 1 when the  \nRF output is stable and the system is in a static state. Current \nSetting 2 is meant to be used when the system is dynamic and  \nin a state  of change, that is, when a new output frequency is \nprogrammed.  \nThe normal sequence of events is as follows:  \nThe user initially decides the referred charge pump currents. For example, the choice can be 2.5 mA as Current Setting 1 and 5 mA as Current Settin g 2. \nAt the same time, the decision must be made as to how long the secondary current is to stay active before reverting to the primary current. This is controlled by Timer Counter Control Bit DB14 to Timer Counter Control Bit DB11 (TC4 to TC1) in the func tion latch. See Figure 18 for the truth table.  \nTo program a new output frequency, simply program the N counter latch with a new value for N. At the same time, the CP \ngain bit can be set to  1. This sets the charge pump with the \nvalue in CPI6 to CPI4 for a period of time determined by TC4 \nto TC1. When this time is up, the charge pump current reverts \nto the value set by CPI3 to CPI1. At the same time, the CP gain bit in the N counter latch is reset to 0 and is ready for the next \ntime that the user wishes to change the frequency.  \nNote that there is an enable feature on the timer counter. It is \nenabled when Fastlock Mode 2 is chosen by setting the Fastlock \nMode Bit DB10 in the function latch to 1.  \nADF4002  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 16 of 20 Charge Pump Currents  \nCPI3, CPI2, and CP I1 program Current Setting 1 for the charge \npump. CPI6, CPI5, and CPI4 program Current Setting 2 for the \ncharge pump. See Figure 18 for the truth table.  \nPD Polarity  \nThis bit sets the phase detector polarity bit (see Figure 18). \nCP Three -State  \nThis bit controls the CP output pin. Setting the bit high puts the \nCP output into three -state. With the bit set low, the CP output  \nis enabled. \nINITIALIZATION LATCH \nThe initialization latch is programmed when C2, C1 =  1, 1. This \nis essentially the same as the function latch (programmed when \nC2, C1 = 1, 0).  \nHowever, when the initialization latch is programmed there is an additional internal reset pulse applied to the R and N \ncounters. This pulse ensures that the N count er is at load point \nwhen the N counter data is latched and the device begins \ncounting in close phase alignment.  \nIf the latch is programmed for synchronous power -down (CE \npin is high; PD1 bit is high; and PD2 bit is low), the internal \npulse also triggers th is power -down. The prescaler reference \nand the oscillator input buffer are unaffected by the internal \nreset pulse, thereby maintaining close phase alignment when \ncounting resumes.  \nWhen the first N counter data is latched after initialization, the \ninternal reset pulse is reactivated. However, successive AB \ncounter loads after this do not trigger the internal reset pulse.  \nDevice Programming After Initial Power -Up \nAfter initially powering up the device, there are three ways to program the device.  \nInitializatio n Latch Method  \n1. Apply V DD. \n2. Program the initialization latch (11 in two LSBs of input \nword). Make sure that the F1 bit is programmed to 0.  \n3. Conduct a function latch load (10 in two LSBs of the control word). Make sure that the F1 bit is programmed to 0.  \n4. Perform an R load (00 in two LSBs).  \n5. Perform an N load (01 in two LSBs).  When the initialization latch is loaded, the following occurs:  \n• The function latch contents are loaded.  \n• An internal pulse resets the R, N, and timeout counters to \nload state conditions a nd three -states the charge pump. \nNote that the prescaler band gap reference and the oscilla -\ntor input buffer are unaffected by the internal reset pulse, \nallowing close phase alignment when counting resumes. \n• Latching the first N counter data after the initialization word activates the same internal reset pulse. Successive N \nloads do not trigger the internal reset pulse unless there is \nanother initi alization.  \nCE Pin Method  \n1. Apply V DD. \n2. Bring CE low to put the device into power -down. This is an \nasynchronous powe r-down because it happens immediately . \n3. Program the function latch (10).  \n4. Program the R counter latch (00).  \n5. Program the N counter latch (01).  \n6. Bring CE high to take the device out of power -down. The  \nR and N counters resume counting in close alignment. Note t hat after CE goes high, a duration of 1 µs can be \nrequired for the prescaler band gap voltage and oscillator input buffer bias to reach steady state.  \nCE can be used to power the device up and down to check for channel activity. The input register does not need to be reprogrammed each time the device is disabled and enabled, as long as it has been programmed at least once after V\nDD was \ninitially applied.  \nCounter Reset Method  \n1. Apply V DD. \n2. Do a function latch load (10 in two LSBs). As part of this step, load  1 to the F1 bit. This enables the counter reset.  \n3. Perform an R counter load (00 in two LSBs).  \n4. Perform an N counter load (01 in two LSBs).  \n5. Do a function latch load (10 in two LSBs). As part of this \nstep, load  0 to the F1 bit. This disables the counter reset.  \nThis sequence provides the same close alignment as the \ninitialization method. It offers direct control over the internal \nreset. Note that counter reset holds the counters at load point \nand three -states the charge pump, but does not trigger \nsynchronous power -down.  \n \n \n \nData Sheet ADF4002\n \nRev. D | Page 17 of 20 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nVERY LOW JITTER ENCODE CLOCK FOR HIGH \nSPEED CONVERTERS \nFigure 20 shows the ADF4002  with a VCXO to provide the \nencode clock for a high speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC). \nThe converter used in this application is an AD9215-80, a 12-bit \nconverter that accepts up to an 80 MHz encode clock. To realize \na stable low jitter clock, use a 77.76 MHz, narrow-band VCXO. This example assumes a 19.44 MHz reference clock. \nTo minimize the phase noise contribution of the ADF4002 , the \nsmallest multiplication factor of 4 is used. Thus, the R divider is \nprogrammed to 1, and the N divider is programmed to 4.  \nThe charge pump output of the ADF4002  (Pin 2) drives the \nloop filter. The loop filter bandwidth is optimized for the best \npossible rms jitter, a key factor in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ADC. Too narrow a bandwidth allows the VCXO noise to dominate at small offsets from the carrier frequency. \nToo wide a bandwidth allows the ADF4002  noise to dominate at \noffsets where the VCXO noise is lower than the ADF4002  noise. \nThus, the intersection of the VCXO noise and the ADF4002  in-\nband noise is chosen as the optimum loop filter bandwidth.  \nThe design of the loop filter uses the ADIsimPLL  (Version 3.0) and \nis available as a free download from www.analog.com/ADIsimPLL . \nThe rms jitter is measured at <1.2 ps. This level is lower than \nthe maximum allowable 6 ps rms required to ensure the \ntheoretical SNR performance of 59 dB for this converter.  \nThe setup shown in Figure 20 using the ADF4002 , AD9215, and \nan ADC FIFO evaluation board allows the user to quickly and \neffectively determine the suitability of the converter and encode clock. The SPI® interface is used to control the ADF4002 , and the \nUSB interface helps control the operation of the AD9215-80 . The \ncontroller board sends back FFT information to the PC that, if using an ADC analyzer, provides all conversion results from the \nADC.  \nVCXO: 77.76MHz\nADC FIFO\nEVALUATION\nBOARDPC\nUSBTCXO:\n19.44MHz\nENCODE\nCLOCK\nAINADF4002\nN = 4PDR = 1SPI\nAGILENT:\n500kHz, 1.8V p-p\n06052-034AD9215-80\n \nFigure 20. ADF4002  as Encode Clock PFD \nAs the ADF4002  permits both R and N counters to be pro-\ngrammed to 1, the part can effectively be used as a standalone \nPFD and charge pump. This is particularly useful in either a clock cleaning application or a high performance LO. Addi-\ntionally, the very low normalized phase noise floor (−222 dBc/Hz) \nenables very low in-band phase noise levels. It is possible to \noperate the PFD up to a maximum frequency of 104 MHz. \nIn Figure 21, the reference frequency equals the PFD; therefore, \nR = 1. The charge pump output integrates into a stable control voltage for the VCXO, and the output from the VCXO is divided \ndown to the desired PFD frequency using an external divider. \n06052-0358216 157\n6\n5\n9 4 31REF IN REF INRSET\nRFINA\nRFINBAVDD\nDVDDCPGND\nAGND\nDGNDVDDVP VP\nCE\nADF4002\nDECOUPLING CAPACITORS AND\nINTERFACE SIGNALS HAVE BEEN\nOMITTED FROM THE DIAGRAM IN\nTHE INTERESTS OF GREATERCLARITY.100pF100pF\n51Ω10kΩLOOP\nFILTER\nGNDVCO\nOR\nVCXOVCC\nGNDEXTERNAL PRESCALER18Ω18Ω\n18Ω100pF100pFRFOUT\nVCC\nVCC\n \nFigure 21. ADF4002  as a PFD \nINTERFACING \nThe ADF4002  has a simple SPI-compatible serial interface for \nwriting to the device. CLK, DATA, and LE control the data \ntransfer. When the latch enable (Pin LE) goes high, the 24 bits that have been clocked into the input register on each rising edge of CLK are transferred to the appropriate latch. For more information, see Figure 2 for the timing diagram and Table 6 for the latch truth table. \nThe maximum allowable serial clock rate is 20 MHz. This \nmeans that the maximum update rate possible for the device is \n833 kHz, or one update every 1.2 μs. This is certainly more than adequate for systems that have typical lock times in hundreds of \nmicroseconds. \n    \n \n   \nADF4002  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 18 of 20 ADuC812 Interface  \nFigure 22 shows the interface between the ADF4002 and the \nADuC812 MicroConverter®. Because  the ADuC812 is based on \nan 8051 core, this interface can be use d with any 8051 -based \nmicro controller. The MicroConverter is set up for SPI master \nmode with CPHA = 0. To initiate the operation, the I/O port \ndriving LE is brought low. Each latch of the ADF4002 needs a \n24-bit word. This is accomplished by writing three  8-bit bytes \nfrom the MicroConverter to the device. When the third byte has been wr itten, bring the LE input high to complete the \ntransfer.  \nOn first applying power to the ADF4002, it needs four writes \n(one each to the initialization latch, function latch, R counter \nlatch, and  N counter latch) for the output to become active.  \nI/O port lines on the ADuC812 are also used to control power -\ndown (CE input) and to detect lock (MUXOUT configured as lock detect and polled b y the port input).  \nWhen operating in the S PI master mode, the maximum SCLOCK  \nrate of the ADuC812 is 4 MHz. This means that the maximum \nrate at which the output frequency can be changed is 166 kHz.  \nCLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)MOSISCLOCK\nI/O PORTSADuC812 ADF4002\n06052-019 \nFigure 22.

The easiest way to accom -\nplish this using the ADSP -2181 family is to use the autobuffered \ntransmit mode of operation with alte rnate framing. This provides  \na means for transmitting an entire block of serial data before an interrupt is generated. Set up the word length for eight  bits and \nuse three memory locati ons for each 24 -bit word. To program \neach 24 -bit latch, store the three 8 -bit bytes, enable the \nautobuffered mode, and then write to the transmit register of the DSP . This last operation initiates the autobuffer transfer.  \nCLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)ADSP-2181 ADF4002DTSCLK\nI/O FLAGSTFS\n06052-020 \nFigure 23. ADSP -2181  to ADF4002  Interface \nPCB DESIGN GUIDELINE S FOR CHIP SCALE \nPACKAGE  \nThe lands on the lead frame chip scale package (CP -20-1) are \nrectangular. The printed circuit board pad for these should be 0.1 mm longer than the package land length and 0.05 mm wider than the package land width. The land should be centered on \nthe pad. This ensures that the solder joint size is maximized . \nThe bottom of the lead frame chip scale package has a central \nthermal pad.  \nThe thermal pad on the printed circuit board should be at least as large as this exposed pad. On the printed circuit board, there should be a clearance of at least 0.25 mm between  the thermal \npad and the inner edges of the pad pattern. This ensures that \nshorting is avoided.  \nThermal vias can be used on the printed circuit board thermal \npad to improve thermal performance of the package. If vias are used, they should be incorporated i nto the thermal pad at a \n1.2 mm pitch grid. The via diameter should be between 0.3 mm \nand 0.33 mm and the via ba rrel should be plated with 1  oz \ncopper to plug the via.  \nThe user should connect the printed circuit board thermal pad to AGND.  \n \nData Sheet  ADF4002  \n \nRev.
