The drivers are available with either TTL \ninput thresholds (FAN312xT) or VDD-proportional CMOS \ninput thresholds (FAN312xC ). Internal circuitry provides \nan under -voltage lockout function by holding the output \nlow until the supply voltage is within the operating range.   \nFAN312x drivers incorporate the MillerDrive™ architecture for the final output stage. This bipolar / MOSFET combination provides the highest peak current \nduring the Miller plateau stage of the MOSFET turn -on / \nturn-off process.  \nThe FAN3121 and FAN3122 drivers implement an enable function on pin 3 (EN), previously unused in the \nindustry -standard pin- out. The pin is internally pulled up \nto V\nDD for active HIGH logic and can be left open for \nstandard operation.  \nThe commercial FAN3121/22 is available in a 3x3  mm \n8-lead thermally -enhanced MLP package or an 8 -lead\nSOIC package.

In the FAN3121T and FAN3122T, the input thresholds meet industry-standard TTL-logic thresholds independent of the VDD voltage, and there is a hysteresis voltage of approximately 0.7 V. These levels permit the inputs to be driven from a range of input logic signal levels for which a voltage over 2 V is considered logic HIGH. The driving signal for the TTL inputs should have fast rising and falling edges with a slew rate of 6 V/µs or faster, so the rise time from 0 to 3.3 V should be 550 ns or less. The FAN3121 and FAN3122 output can be enabled or disabled using the EN pin with a very rapid response time. If EN is not externally connected, an internal pull-up resistor enables the driver by default. The EN pin has logic thresholds for parts with either TTL or CMOS IN thresholds. In the FAN3121C and FAN3122C, the logic input thresholds are dependent on the VDD level and, with VDD of 12 V, the logic rising edge threshold is approximately 55% of VDD and the input falling edge threshold is approximately 38% of VDD. The CMOS input configuration offers a hysteresis voltage of approximately 17% of VDD. The CMOS inputs can be used with relatively slow edges (approaching DC) if good decoupling and bypass techniques are incorporated in the system design to prevent noise from violating the input voltage hysteresis window. This allows setting precise timing intervals by fitting an R-C circuit between the controlling signal and the IN pin of the driver. The slow rising edge at the IN pin of the driver introduces a delay between the controlling signal and the OUT pin of the driver. Static Supply Current In the IDD (static) Typical Performance Characteristics, the curves are produced with all inputs / enables floating (OUT is LOW) and indicates the lowest static IDD current for the tested configuration. For other states, additional current flows through the 100 kΩ resistors on the inputs and outputs, as shown in the block diagram (see Figure 7). In these cases, the actual static IDD current is the value obtained from the curves, plus this additional current. MillerDrive™ Gate-Drive Technology FAN312x gate drivers incorporate the MillerDrive™ architecture shown in Figure 46. For the output stage, a combination of bipolar and MOS devices provide large currents over a wide range of supply voltage and temperature variations. The bipolar devices carry the bulk of the current as OUT swings between 1/3 to 2/3 VDD and the MOS devices pull the output to the HIGH or LOW rail. The purpose of the Miller Drive™ architecture is to speed up switching by providing high current during the Miller plateau region when the gate-drain capacitance of the MOSFET is being charged or discharged as part of the turn-on / turn-off process.  For applications with zero voltage switching during the MOSFET turn-on or turn-off interval, the driver supplies high peak current for fast switching, even though the Miller plateau is not present. This situation often occurs in synchronous rectifier applications because the body diode is generally conducting before the MOSFET is switched on.  The output pin slew rate is determined by VDD voltage and the load on the output. It is not user adjustable, but a series resistor can be added if a slower rise or fall time at the MOSFET gate is needed.  \nInputstageVDDVOUT Figure 46. Miller Drive™ Output Architecture Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) The FAN312x startup logic is optimized to drive ground-referenced N-channel MOSFETs with an under-voltage lockout (UVLO) function to ensure that the IC starts in an orderly fashion. When VDD is rising, yet below the 4.0 V operational level, this circuit holds the output low, regardless of the status of the input pins. After the part is active, the supply voltage must drop 0.25 V before the part shuts down. This hysteresis helps prevent chatter when low VDD supply voltages have noise from the power switching. This configuration is not suitable for driving high-side P-channel MOSFETs because the low output voltage of the driver would turn the P-channel MOSFET on with VDD below 4.0 V. VDD Bypassing and Layout Considerations The FAN3121 and FAN3122 are available in either  8-lead SOIC or MLP packages. In either package, the VDD pins 1 and 8 and the GND pins 4 and 5 should be connected together on the PCB. In typical FAN312x gate-driver applications, high-current pulses are needed to charge and discharge the gate of a power MOSFET in time intervals of 50 ns or less. A bypass capacitor with low ESR and ESL should be connected directly between the VDD and GND pins to provide these large current pulses without causing unacceptable ripple on the VDD supply. To meet these requirements in a small size, a ceramic capacitor of 1 µF or larger is typically used, with a dielectric material such as X7R, to limit the change in capacitance over the temperature and / or voltage application ranges.  \n \nwww.onsemi.com 15 \nFAN3121 / FAN3122 — Single 9-A High-Speed, Low-Side Gate Driver  \n Figure 47 shows the pulsed gate drive current path when the gate driver is supplying gate charge to turn the MOSFET on. The current is supplied from the local bypass capacitor CBYP and flows through the driver to the MOSFET gate and to ground. To reach the high peak currents possible with the FAN312x family, the resistance and inductance in the path should be minimized. The localized CBYP acts to contain the high peak current pulses within this driver-MOSFET circuit, preventing them from disturbing the sensitive analog circuitry in the PWM controller. \n Figure 47. Current Path for MOSFET Turn-On Figure 48 shows the path the current takes when the gate driver turns the MOSFET off. Ideally, the driver shunts the current directly to the source of the MOSFET in a small circuit loop. For fast turn-off times, the resistance and inductance in this path should be minimized. \n Figure 48. Current Path for MOSFET Turn-Off Operational Waveforms At power up, the FAN3121 inverting driver shown in Figure 49 holds the output LOW until the VDD voltage reaches the UVLO turn-on threshold, as indicated in Figure 50. This facilitates proper startup control of low-side N-channel MOSFETs.   Figure 49.

It is important to determine the driver power dissipation and the resulting junction temperature in the application to ensure that the part is operating within acceptable temperature limits.  The total power dissipation in a gate driver is the sum of two components, PGATE and PDYNAMIC: PTOTAL = PGATE + PDYNAMIC (1) Gate Driving Loss: The most significant power loss results from supplying gate current (charge per unit time) to switch the load MOSFET on and off at the switching frequency. The power dissipation that results from driving a MOSFET at a specified gate-source voltage, VGS, with gate charge, QG, at switching frequency, fSW, is determined by: PGATE = QG • VGS • fSW  (2) Dynamic Pre-drive / Shoot-through Current: A power loss resulting from internal current consumption under dynamic operating conditions, including pin pull-up / pull-down resistors, can be obtained using the “IDD (No-Load) vs. Frequency” graphs in Typical Performance Characteristics to determine the current IDYNAMIC drawn from VDD under actual operating conditions: PDYNAMIC = IDYNAMIC • VDD (3) Once the power dissipated in the driver is determined, the driver junction rise with respect to circuit board can be evaluated using the following thermal equation, assuming ψJB was determined for a similar thermal design (heat sinking and air flow):  TJ = PTOTAL • ψJB + TB (4) where: TJ = driver junction temperature; ψJB = (psi) thermal characterization parameter relating temperature rise to total power dissipation; and TB = board temperature in location as defined in the Thermal Characteristics table. In a full-bridge synchronous rectifier application, shown in Figure 53, each FAN3122 drives a parallel combination of two high-current MOSFETs, (such as FDMS8660S). The typical gate charge for each SR MOSFET is 70 nC with VGS = VDD = 9 V. At a switching frequency of 300 kHz, the total power dissipation is: PGATE = 2 • 70 nC • 9V • 300 kHz = 0.378 W (5) PDYNAMIC = 2 mA • 9 V = 18 mW (6) PTOTAL = 0.396 W (7) The SOIC-8 has a junction-to-board thermal characterization parameter of ψJB = 42°C/W. In a system application, the localized temperature around the device is a function of the layout and construction of the PCB along with airflow across the surfaces. To ensure reliable operation, the maximum junction temperature of the device must be prevented from exceeding the maximum rating of 150°C; with 80% derating, TJ would be limited to 120°C. Rearranging Equation 4 determines the board temperature required to maintain the junction temperature below 120°C: TB,MAX = TJ - PTOTAL • ψJB  (8) TB,MAX = 120°C – 0.396 W • 42°C/W = 104°C (9) For comparison, replace the SOIC-8 used in the previous example with the 3x3 mm MLP package with ψJB = 2.8°C/W. The 3x3 mm MLP package can operate at a PCB temperature of 118°C, while maintaining the junction temperature below 120°C. This illustrates that the physically smaller MLP package with thermal pad offers a more conductive path to remove the heat from the driver. Consider tradeoffs between reducing overall circuit size with junction temperature reduction for increased reliability.   \n \nwww.onsemi.com 17 \nFAN3121 / FAN3122 — Single 9-A High-Speed, Low-Side Gate Driver  \n Typical Application Diagrams  \n Figure 53.
