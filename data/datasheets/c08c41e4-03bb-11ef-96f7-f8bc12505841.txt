The silicon PIN/NIP chip \nseries of devices cover a broad spectrum of perfor-\nmance requirements for control circuit applications. \nThey are available in several choices of I -region \nlengths and have been optimally designed to mini-\nmize      parametric trade offs when considering low          \ncapacitance, low series resistance, and high          \nbreakdown voltages. Their small size and low         \nparasitics, make them an ideal choice for            \nbroadband, high frequency, micro -strip hybrid         \nassemblies.  \n \nThe attenuator line of PIN diode chips are a planar \nor mesa construction and because of their thicker     \nI-regions and predictable R S vs. I characteristics, \nthey are well suited for low distortion attenuator      \nand switch circuits. Incorporated in the chip ’s               \nconstruction is MACOM ’s, time proven, hard glass, \nCermachip process. The hard glass passivation \ncompletely encapsulates the entire PIN junction area \nresulting in a hermetically sealed chip which has \nbeen qualified in many military applications. These \nCermachip diodes are available in a wide range of \nvoltages, up to 3,000 volts, which are capable of \ncontrolling kilowatts of RF power.  \n \n \n \n   \nMany of MACOM ’s silicon PIN diode chips are also available \nin several different package styles.

V28  Silicon PIN / NIP Diode Chips  \nDie Handling and Bonding Information:  \n \nHandling:  \nAll semiconductor chips should be handled with care \nto avoid damage or contamination from perspiration, \nsalts, and skin oils. The use of plastic tipped               \ntweezers or vacuum pickup is strongly                          \nrecommended for the handling and placing of              \nindividual components. Bulk handling should ensure \nthat abrasion and mechanical shock are minimized.  \n \nDie Attach Surface:  \nDie can be mounted with an 80Au/Sn20, eutectic \nsolder preform, RoHS compliant solders or                 \nelectrically conductive silver epoxy. The metal RF \nand DC ground plane mounting surface must be free \nof contamination and should have a surface flatness \nof < ±0.002 ”. \n \nEutectic Die Attachment Using Hot Gas \nDie Bonder:  \nA work surface temperature of +255°C is                  \nrecommended. When hot forming gas (95%N/5%H) \nis applied, the work area temperature should be   \napproximately +290°C. The chip should not be           \nexposed to temperatures greater than +320°C for \nmore than 10 seconds.  \n \nEutectic Die Attachment Using Reflow \nOven:  \nFor recommended reflow profile refer to Application \nNote 538 “Surface Mounting Instructions ”. Electrically Conductive Epoxy Die           \nAttachment:  \nA controlled amount of electrically conductive, silver \nepoxy, approximately 1 - 2 mils in thickness, should \nbe used to minimize ohmic and thermal resistance. \nA thin epoxy fillet should be visible around the            \nperimeter of the chip after placement to ensure full \narea coverage. Cure conductive epoxy per               \nmanufacturer ’s schedule. Typically +150°C for         \n1 hour.  \n \nWire and Ribbon Bonding:   \nThe die anode bond pads have a Ti -Pt-Au                         \nmetallization scheme, with a final gold thickness of \n1.0 micron. Thermo -compression or thermo -sonic \nwedge bonding of either gold wire or ribbon is             \nrecommended. A bonder heat stage temperature \nsetting of +200°C, tool tip temperature of +150°C \nand a force of 18 to 50 grams is suggested.           \nUltrasonic energy may also be used but should be \nadjusted to the minimum amplitude required to \nachieve an acceptable bond. Excessive energy may \ncause the anode metallization to separate from the \nchip. Automatic ball or wedge bonding may also be \nused.  \n \n \n \nFor more detailed handling and assembly       \ninstructions, see Application Note M541, \n“Bonding and Handling Procedures for Chip   \nDiode Devices ”.   \n9 9 \nMACOM Technology Solutions Inc.
