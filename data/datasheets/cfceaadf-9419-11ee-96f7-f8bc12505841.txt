They are balanced, or differential, \nvoltage mode devices that are compatible with ANSI \nstandard TIA/EIA-485-A and ISO 8482:1987(E). The \nA version offers improved switching performance over \nits predecessors without sacrificing significantly more \npower.The SN65LBC179A and SN75LBC179A combine \na differential line driver and differential input line \nreceiver and operate from a single 5-V supply. The \ndriver differential outputs and the receiver differential \ninputs are connected to separate terminals for \nfull-duplex operation and are designed to present \nminimum loading to the bus when powered off (V CC \n= 0). These parts feature a wide positive and negative \ncommon-mode voltage range making them suitable \nfor point-to-point or multipoint data bus applications. \nThe devices also provide positive- and negative-\ncurrent limiting and thermal shutdown for protection \nfrom line fault conditions.\nThe SN65LBC179A is characterized over the \nindustrial temperature range of –40°C to 85°C. The \nSN75LBC179A is characterized for operation over the \ncommercial temperature range of 0°C to 70°C.\nPackage Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nSN65LBC179ASN75\nLBC179AD (SOIC) 4.9 mm x 3.91 mm\nP (PDIP) 9.81 mm x 6.35 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nR\nDBA\nZY78\n652\n3\nFigure 2-1.

#### Description:
The **SN65LBC179A** is a low-power differential line driver and receiver pair designed for bidirectional data communication over long cables. It utilizes balanced, differential voltage mode signaling and is compatible with ANSI standard TIA/EIA-485-A and ISO 8482:1987(E). The device operates from a single 5-V supply and features separate terminals for driver outputs and receiver inputs, allowing for full-duplex operation. The SN65LBC179A is optimized for improved switching performance while maintaining low power consumption.

#### Typical Applications:
The SN65LBC179A is commonly used in:
- **Data Communication:** Ideal for point-to-point or multipoint data bus applications, particularly in industrial environments.
- **Networking:** Suitable for RS-485 communication systems, enabling robust data transmission over long distances.
- **Control Systems:** Utilized in automation and control systems where reliable data transfer is critical.
- **Telecommunications:** Employed in systems requiring high-speed data transfer with minimal power consumption.

This component is particularly valuable in applications where long cable runs and noise immunity are essential, making it a popular choice in industrial and commercial communication systems.
