Furthermore, the AD620 features 8-lead SOIC and \nDIP packaging that is smaller than discrete designs and offers \nlower power (only 1.3 mA max supply current), making it a \ngood fit for battery-powered, portable (or remote) applications. \nThe AD620 , with its high accuracy of 40 ppm maximum \nnonlinearity, low offset voltage of 50 μV max, and offset drift of \n0.6 μV/°C max, is ideal for use in precision data acquisition \nsystems, such as weigh scales and transducer interfaces. \nFurthermore, the low noise, low input bias current, and low power of the AD620 make it well suited for medical applications, such \nas ECG and noninvasive blood pressure monitors.  \nThe low input bias current of 1.0 nA max is made possible with \nthe use of Superϐeta processing in the input stage. The AD620 \nworks well as a preamplifier due to its low input voltage noise of \n9 nV/√Hz at 1 kHz, 0.28 μV p-p in the 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz band, and 0.1 pA/√Hz input current noise. Also, the AD620 is well \nsuited for multiplexed applications with its settling time of 15 μs to 0.01%, and its cost is low enough to enable designs with one \nin-amp per channel. \nTable 1.

Simplified Schematic of AD620 \nThe AD620 is a monolithic instrumentation amplifier based on \na modification of the classic three op amp approach. Absolute \nvalue trimming allows the user to program gain accurately   \n(to 0.15% at G = 100) with only one resistor. Monolithic construction and laser wafer trimming allow the tight matching and tracking of circuit components, thus ensuring the high level \nof performance inherent in this circuit. The input transistors Q1 and Q2 provide a single differential-\npair bipolar input for high precision ( Figure 36 ), yet offer 10× \nlower input bias current thanks to Superϐeta processing. \nFeedback through the Q1-A1-R1 loop and the Q2-A2-R2 loop maintains constant collector current of the input devices Q1 and Q2, thereby impressing the input voltage across the external \ngain setting resistor R\nG. This creates a differential gain from the \ninputs to the A1/A2 outputs given by G = (R1 + R2)/RG + 1. The \nunity-gain subtractor, A3, removes any common-mode signal, \nyielding a single-ended output referred to the REF pin potential. \nThe value of R G also determines the transconductance of the \npreamp stage. As RG is reduced for larger gains, the \ntransconductance increases asymptotically to that of the input \ntransistors. This has three important advantages: (a) Open-loop \ngain is boosted for increasing programmed gain, thus reducing gain related errors. (b) The gain-bandwidth product (determined by C1 and C2 and the preamp transconductance) increases with programmed gain, thus optimizing frequency response. (c) The input voltage noise is reduced to a value of \n9 nV/√Hz, determined mainly by the collector current and base \nresistance of the input devices. \nThe internal gain resistors, R1 and R2, are trimmed to an \nabsolute value of 24.7 kΩ, allowing the gain to be programmed \naccurately with a single external resistor. \nThe gain equation is then \n14 . 49+Ω=\nGRkG  \n14 . 49\n−Ω=GkRG  \n \nMake vs. Buy: a Typical Brid ge Application Error Budget \nThe AD620 offers improved performance over “homebrew” \nthree op amp IA designs, along with smaller size, fewer \ncomponents, and 10× lower supply current. In the typical \napplication, shown in Figure 37 , a gain of 100 is required to \namplify a bridge output of 20 mV full-scale over the industrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C. Table 4  shows how to \ncalculate the effect various error sources have on circuit accuracy. \n AD620\n \nRev. H | Page 13 of 20 Regardless of the system in which it is being used, the AD620 \nprovides greater accuracy at low power and price. In simple \nsystems, absolute accuracy and drift errors are by far the most significant contributors to error. In more complex systems  with an intelligent processor, an autogain/autozero cycle removes all absolute accuracy and drift errors, leaving only the \nresolution errors of gain, nonlinearity, and noise, thus allowing \nfull 14-bit accuracy. Note that for the homebrew circuit, the OP07 specifications for \ninput voltage offset and noise have been multiplied by √2. This \nis because a three op amp type in-amp has two op amps at its \ninputs, both contributing to the overall input error. \n  \nR = 350Ω10V\nPRECISION BRIDGE TRANSDUCE RR = 350Ω R = 350ΩR = 350Ω\n00775-0-039 \n AD620A MONOLITHIC\nINSTRUMENTATIONAMPLIFIER, G = 100\nSUPPLY CURRENT = 1.3mA MAXAD620ARG\n499Ω\nREFERENCE\n00775-0-040 \n \n \nFigure 37.

In such a circuit, the bridge consumes only 1.7 mA. \nAdding the AD620 and a buffered voltage divider allows the \nsignal to be conditioned for only 3.8 mA of total supply current. \nSmall size and low cost make the AD620 especially attractive for \nvoltage output pressure transducers. Since it delivers low noise \nand drift, it also serves applications such as diagnostic \nnoninvasive blood pressure measurement. \n  Medical ECG \nThe low current noise of the AD620 allows its use in ECG \nmonitors ( Figure 39 ) where high source resistances of 1 MΩ or \nhigher are not uncommon. The AD620’s low power, low supply \nvoltage requirements, and space-saving 8-lead mini-DIP and SOIC package offerings make it an excellent choice for battery-powered data recorders. \nFurthermore, the low bias currents and low current noise, \ncoupled with the low voltage noise of the AD620, improve the dynamic range for better performance. \nThe value of capacitor C1 is chosen to maintain stability of  \nthe right leg drive loop.

Precision Voltage-to-Current Converter (Operates on 1.8 mA, ±3 V) \n \nGAIN SELECTION \nThe AD620 gain is resistor-programmed by R G, or more \nprecisely, by whatever impedance appears between Pins 1 and 8. \nThe AD620 is designed to offer accurate gains using 0.1% to 1% resistors. Table 5  shows required values of R\nG for various gains. \nNote that for G = 1, the R G pins are unconnected (R G = ∞). For \nany arbitrary gain, R G can be calculated by using the formula:  \n14 . 49\n−Ω=GkRG  \nTo minimize gain error, avoid high parasitic resistance in series \nwith R G; to minimize gain drift, R G should have a low TC—less \nthan 10 ppm/°C—for the best performance. \n \nTable 5.

The output error is divided by G  when \nreferred to the input. In practice, the input errors dominate at high gains, and the output errors dominate at low gains. The \ntotal V\nOS for a given gain is calculated as \nTotal Error RTI = input error + (output error/G) \nTotal Error RTO = (input error × G) + output error \nREFERENCE TERMINAL \nThe reference terminal potential defines the zero output voltage \nand is especially useful when the load does not share a precise \nground with the rest of the system. It provides a direct means of injecting a precise offset to the output, with an allowable range of 2 V within the supply voltages. Parasitic resistance should be kept to a minimum for optimum CMR. \nINPUT PROTECTION \nThe AD620 safely withstands an input current of ±60 mA for \nseveral hours at room temperature. This is true for all gains and \npower on and off, which is useful if the signal source and amplifier are powered separately. For longer time periods, the \ninput current should not exceed 6 mA.  \nFor input voltages beyond the supplies, a protection resistor \nshould be placed in series with each input to limit the current to \n6 mA. These can be the same resistors as those used in the RFI filter. High values of resistance can impact the noise and AC CMRR performance of the system. Low leakage diodes (such as \nthe BAV199) can be placed at the inputs to reduce the required \nprotection resistance.  \nAD620R\nREFR+SUPPL Y\n–SUPPLYVOUT+IN\n–IN\n00775-0-052 \nFigure 41.

Circuit to Attenuate RF Interference \nCOMMON-MODE REJECTION \nInstrumentation amplifiers, such as the AD620, offer high \nCMR, which is a measure of the change in output voltage when \nboth inputs are changed by equal amounts. These specifications are usually given for a full-range input voltage change and a \nspecified source imbalance. \nFor optimal CMR, the reference terminal should be tied to a \nlow impedance point, and differences in capacitance and \nresistance should be kept to a minimum between the two inputs. In many applications, shielded cables are used to minimize noise; for best CMR over frequency, the shield  \nshould be properly driven. Figure 43  and Figure 44 show active \ndata guards that are configured to improve ac common-mode \nrejections by “bootstrapping” the capacitances of input cable shields, thus minimizing the capacitance mismatch between the \ninputs.

It would be \nconvenient to use a single ground line; however, current through ground wires and PC runs of the circuit card can cause \nhundreds of millivolts of error. Therefore, separate ground \nreturns should be provided to minimize the current flow from the sensitive points to the system ground. These ground returns must be tied together at some point, usually best at the ADC \npackage shown in Figure 45 . \n \nDIGITAL P.S.\n+5V CANALOG P.S.\n+15V C –15V\nAD574ADIGITAL\nDATAOUTPUT+1μF\nAD6200.1μF\nAD585\nS/H ADC0.1μF\n1μF1μF\n00775-0-048 \nFigure 45.
