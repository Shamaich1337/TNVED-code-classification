It supports both \nhalf-duplex and full-duplex 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE- T communication speeds over \nCategory 5 (Cat5) unshielded twisted pair (UTP) ca ble at distan ces greater than 100 m, displaying \nexcellent tolerance to NEXT, FEXT , echo, and other types of amb ient environmental and system \nelectronic noise.\nThe following illustration shows a high-level, general view of a typical VSC8514-11 application.\nFigure 1 • Copper Transceiver Application Diagram\n1.1 Key Features\nThis section lists the main featu res and benefits of the VSC851 4-11 device.\n1.1.1 Superior PHY and  Interface Technology\n• Four integrated 10/ 100/1000BASE-T Et hernet copper transceivers  (IEEE 802.3ab-compliant) \nwith VeriPHY™ cable diagnostics\n• QSGMII SerDes MAC interface\n• Patented line driver with low EMI voltage mode and integrated line side termination resistors\n• HP Auto-MDIX support an d forced MDI/MDIX option\n• Jumbo frame support up to 16 kB  with programmable synchronizat ion FIFOs\n• IEEE 802.3bf register support for  standardized access to infor mation on data delay between the \nMDI and xMII interface for a given PHY\n1.1.2 Energy Efficiency\n• EcoEthernet™ 2.0 green energy ef ficiency with ActiPHY™, Perfec tReach™, and IEEE 802.3az \nEnergy Efficient Ethernet\n• Fully optimized power cons umption for all link speeds\n• Integrated LED brightness control• Clause 45 registers to support IEEE 802.3az Energy Efficient E thernet and IEEE 802.3bf1.0 V 2.5 V\n1x QSGMII\nVSC8514\n4-Port Copper Media\nQSGMII\nMAC Interface1x QSGMII4× RJ-45 \nand Magnetics\nKey Features\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 2\n1.1.3 Key Specifications\n• 1.0 V and 2.5 V power supplies\n• 3.3 V-tolerant 2.5 V inputs (si ngle-ended and bi-directional TTL /CMOS I/Os)\n• Compliant with I EEE 802.3 (10BASE-T, 1 00BASE-TX, and 1000BASE- T)\n• QSGMII v1.3 and IEEE 1149.1 JTAG boundary scan• Devices support operating temper atures of –40 °C ambient to 125 °C junction or 0 °C ambient to \n125 °C junction\n• Available in 12 mm x 12 mm, 138-pin , multi-row plastic QFN package\nBlock Diagram\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 3\n1.2 Block Diagram\nThe following illustration shows the pr imary functional blocks of the VSC8514-11 device.\nFigure 2 • Block DiagramLED[3]_[0:3]P0_D[3:0]N\nP0_D[3:0]P\nP1_D[3:0]NP1_D[3:0]PP2_D[3:0]NP2_D[3:0]PP3_D[3:0]NP3_D[3:0]P\nSerial MAC Interface (QSGMII)\n10/100/\n1000BASE-T \nPCS10/100/\n1000BASE-T \nPMAMDI\nTwisted \nPair\nInterface\nCOMA_MODE\nNRESET\nMDC\nMDIO\nMDINT\nPHYADD[4:2]Management\nand Control\nInterface\n(MIIM) JTAGTMS\nTRST\nTCK\nTDITDOPLL and\nAnalogREFCLK_P/NREFCLK_SEL0REFCLK_SEL1REF_FILT_AREF_REXT_ASerDes_Rext_[1:0]\nLED\nInterface\nAutonegotiation (QSGMII, FIFOs)\nTDP_0\nTDN_0\nRDP_0\nRDN_0GPIO[14:0] GPIO\nLED[2]_[0:3]\nLED[1]_[0:3]\nLED[0]_[0:3]\nSerDes MAC Interface\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 4\n2 Functional Descriptions\nThis section provides detailed information about the functional ity of the VSC8514-11 device, including \navailable configurations, oper ational features, and testing fun ctionality. It includes descriptions of the \nvarious device interfaces and the ir configuration. With the inf ormation in this secti on, the device setup \nparameters can be determined for configuring the VSC8514-11 dev ice for use in a particular application. \n2.1 SerDes MAC Interface\nThe VSC8514-11 SerDes MAC interfa ce performs data serialization  and deserialization functions using \nan integrated enhanced SerDes oper ating in QSGMII mode. The ter mination resistor is integrated into \nthe enhanced SerDes block in the device but does not include in tegrated AC decoupl ing capacitors.\n2.1.1 QSGMII MAC\nThe VSC8514-11 device supports a Q SGMII MAC to con vey two ports  of network data and port speed \nbetween 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, an d 1000BASE-T data rates and ope rates in both half-duplex and \nfull-duplex at all port speeds. T he MAC interface protocol for each port within QSGM II can be either \n1000BASE-X or SGMII, if the QSGMII MAC that the VS C8514-11 is c onnecting to supports this \nfunctionality. The device also supports SGMII MAC-side autonego tiation on each individual port, enabled \nthrough register 16E3, bit 7, of that port.\nFigure 3 • QSGMII MAC Interface\n2.2 PHY Addressing and Port Mapping\nThe VSC8514-11 device includes t hree external PHY address pins,  PHYADD[4:2], to allow control of \nmultiple PHY devices on a system  board sharing a common managem ent bus. These pin s set the most \nsignificant bits of the PHY address port map. The lower two bit s of the address for ea ch port are derived \nfrom the physical address of the  port (0 to 1) and the setting of the PHY address reversal bit in register \n20E1, bit 9.\nThe VSC8514-11 device also inclu des one 5 GHz enhanced SerDes ma cro operating in QSGMII mode.QSGMII MACTxP\nTxN\nRxNRxPTxP\nTxN\nRxNRxP0.1 µF\n0.1 µF\n0.1 µF\n0.1 µF100 W100 Ω\n100 ΩQSGMII MUXPHY \nPort_0\nPHY \nPort_1\nPHY \nPort_2\nPHY \nPort_3\nCat5 Twisted Pair Media Interface\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 5\n2.3 Cat5 Twisted Pair Media Interface\nThe VSC8514-11 twisted pair interf ace is compliant with IEEE 802 .3-2008 and the IEEE 802.3az \nstandard for Energy Efficient Ethernet.\n2.3.1 Voltage Mode Line Driver\nThe VSC8514-11 device uses a pat ented voltage mode line driver that allows it to fully integrate the \nseries termination resistors, whi ch are required to connect the  PHY’s Cat5 interface to an external 1:1 \ntransformer. Also, the interface  does not require the user to p lace an external voltage on the center tap of \nthe magnetic. The following illust ration shows the connections.\nFigure 4 • Cat5 Media Interface\n2.3.2 Cat5 Autonegotiation and Parallel Detection\nThe VSC8514-11 supports twisted pair autonegotiation, as define d by IEEE 802.3-20 08 Clause 28 and \nIEEE 802.3az. The autonegotiation process evaluates the advertis ed capabilities of the local PHY and its \nlink partner to determine the b est possible operating mode. In particular, autonegoti ation can determine \nspeed, duplex configuration, and  master or slave operating modes for 1000BASE-TX. Autonegotiation \nalso enables a connected MAC to communicate with its link partn er MAC through the VSC8514-11 using \noptional next pages to set attribu tes that may not otherwise be  defined by the IEEE standard.\nIf the Category 5 (Cat5) link pa rtner does not support autonegot iation, the VSC8514-11 automatically \nuses parallel detection to select the appropriate link speed.\nAutonegotiation is disabled by cl earing register 0, bit 12. When  autonegotiation is disabled, the state of \nregister bits 0.6, 0.1 3, and 0.8 determine  the device operating speed and duplex mode.P0_D[3:0]N\nP0_D[3:0]P\nP1_D[3:0]N\nP1_D[3:0]P\nP2_D[3:0]N\nP2_D[3:0]P\nP3_D[3:0]N\nP3_D[3:0]PPHY Port_ n Transformer\nA+\nA–\nB+\nB–\nC+\nC–\nD+\nD–1\n2\n3\n6\n4\n5\n7\n8RJ-45\n75 Ω\n75 Ω\n75 Ω75 Ω\n1000 pF,\n2 kV0.1µF\n0.1µF0.1µF0.1µF\nCat5 Twisted Pair Media Interface\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 6\nNote While 10BASE-T and 100BAS E-TX do not require autoneg otiation, I EEE 802.3-2008 Clause 40 \nhas defined 1000BASE-T to require autonegotiation.\n2.3.3 1000BASE-T Forced Mode Support\nThe VSC8514-11 provides support for a 1000BASE-T forced test mo de. In this mode, the PHY can be \nforced into 1000BASE-T mode and does not require manual setting  of master/slave a t the two ends of \nthe link. This mode is for test purposes only, and should not b e used in normal operat ion. To configure a \nPHY in this mode, set register 17 E2, bit 5 = 1 an d register 0, bits 6 and 13 = 10.\n2.3.4 Automatic Crossover and Polarity Detection\nFor trouble-free configuration and management of Ethernet links , the VSC8514-11 includes a robust \nautomatic crossover det ection feature for a ll three speeds on t he twisted pair inte rface (10BASE-T, \n100BASE-T, and 1000BASE T) . Known as HP Auto -MDIX, the function  is fully compliant with Clause 40 \nof IEEE 802.3-2008.\nAdditionally, the device detects and corrects polarity errors o n all MDI pairs — a useful capability that \nexceeds the requirements of the standard.\nBoth HP Auto-MDIX detection and polarity correction are enabled  in the device by default. Default \nsettings can be changed  using device register bits 18.5:4. Stat us bits for each of these functions are \nlocated in register 28.Note The VSC8514-11 can be configured to perform HP Auto-MDIX, even when autonegotiation is \ndisabled and the link is forced into 10/100 speeds. To enable t his feature, set regis ter 18.7 to 0. To use \nthe feature, a lso set register 0.12 to 0.\nThe HP Auto-MDIX algorithm succe ssfully detects, corrects, and operates with any of the MDI wiring pair \ncombinations listed in  the following table.\n2.3.5 Manual MDI/MDIX Setting\nAs an alternative to HP Auto-MDI X detection, the PHY can be for ced to be MDI or MDI-X using register \n19E1, bits 3:2. Setting these bi ts to 10 forces MDI and setting  11 forces MDI-X. Leaving the bits 00 \nenables the HP Auto-MD IX setting to be based  on register 18, bi ts 7 and 5.\n2.3.6 Link Speed Downshift\nFor operation in cabling envir onments that are incompatible wit h 1000BASE-T, the VSC8514-11 provides \nan automatic link speed downshif t option. When enabled, the dev ice automatically changes its \n1000BASE-T autonego tiation advertisement to the next slower spe ed after a set number of failed \nattempts at 1000BASE-T. No reset is required to get out of this  state when a subsequent link partner with \n1000BASE-T support is c onnected. This featur e is useful in sett ing up in networks using older cable \ninstallations that include only pa irs A and B, and not pairs C and D.\nTo configure and monitor link speed downshifting, set register 20E1, bits 4:1. For m ore information, see \nTable 45 on page 3-44 .Table 1 • Supported MDI Pair Combinations\n1, 2 3, 6 4, 5 7, 8 Mode\nA B C D Normal MDI\nB A D C Normal MDI-XA B D C Normal MDI with pair swap on C and D pair\nB A C D Normal MDI-X with pair swap on C and D pair\nReference Clock\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 7\n2.3.7 Energy Efficient Ethernet\nThe VSC8514-11 supports the IEEE 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet standard to provide a method for \nreducing power consumption on an Ethernet link during times of low utilization. It uses low-power idles \n(LPI) to achieve  this objective.\nFigure 5 • Low-Power Idle Operation\nUsing LPI, the usage model for the link is  to transmit data as fast as possible and th en return to a low-\npower idle state. Energy is saved on the link by cycling betwee n active and low-power idle states. During \nLPI, power is reduced by turnin g off unused circ uits and using this method, energy use scales with \nbandwidth utilization. The VSC8514-11 uses LPI to optimize powe r dissipation in 100BASE-TX and \n1000BASE-T modes of operation. \nIn addition, the IEEE 802.3az s tandard defines a 10BASE-Te mode that reduces transmit signal \namplitude from 5 Vp-p to approximately 3.3 Vp-p. This mode reduces power consumption in 10 Mbps link \nspeed and fully interoperates with legacy 10BASE-T compliant PH Ys over 100 m Cat5 cable or better.\nTo configure the VSC8514-11 in 10BASE-Te mode, set register 17E2.15 to 1 for each port. Additional \nenergy efficient Ethernet features are controlled through Claus e 45 registers. For more information, see \n"Clause 45 Registers to Support En ergy Efficient Ethernet and 8 02.3bf" on page 3-62 .\n2.4 Reference Clock\nThe device reference clock supports 125 MHz and 156.25 MHz compli ant clock signals. The clock signal \nmust be capacitively coupled and LVDS complaint.\n2.4.1 Configuring the Reference Clock\nThe REFCLK_SEL1 and REFCLK_SEL0 p ins configure the reference cl ock speed. The following table \nshows the functionality and associated reference clock frequenc y.\n2.5 Ethernet Inline-Powered Devices\nThe VSC8514-11 can detect legacy i nline-powered devices in Ethe rnet network applications. Inline-\npowered detection capability is use ful in systems that enable I P phones and other devices (such as \nwireless access points) to receive power directly from their Et hernet cable, similar to office digital phones \nreceiving power from a private branch exchange (PBX) office swi tch over telephone cabling. This type of \nsetup eliminates the need for an external power supply and enab les the inline-powered device to remain \nactive during a power outage, a ssuming that the Ethernet switch  is connected to an uninterrupted power \nsupply, battery, back-up power generator, or other uninterruptable power source.ActiveSleepActiveActive\nWakeActive\nRefresh\nRefresh\nQuiet Quiet QuietLow Power Idle\nTsTrTq\nTable 2 • REFCLK Frequency Selection\nREFCLK_SEL1 REFCLK_SEL0 Frequency\n0 0 125 MHz1 0 156.25 MHz\nEthernet Inline-Powered Devices\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 8\nFor more information about lega cy inline-powered device detecti on, visit the Cisco Web site at \nwww.cisco.com.

Ensure that the VSC8514-11 aut onegotiation enable bit (regist er 0.12) is also s et to 1. In the \napplication, the device sends a s pecial fast link pulse signal to the link partner. Reading register \nbit 23E1.9:8 returns 00 during t he search for devices that requi re power over Ethernet (PoE).\n3. The VSC8514-11 PHY monitors its  inputs for the fast link pulse signal looped back by the link \npartner. A link partner capable of receiving PoE loops back the  fast link pulses when the link \npartner is powered down. This is reported when VSC8514-11 regis ter bit 23E1.9:8 reads back 01. \nIt can also be verified as an inline-power detection interrupt by reading VSC8514-11 register \nbit 26.9, which should be a 1, and which is subsequently cleared  and the interrupt  de-asserted \nafter the read. When a link partner device does not loop back t he fast link pulse after a specific \ntime, VSC8514-11 register bit 23E1.9:8 automatically resets to 1 0.\n4. If the VSC8514-11 PHY reports t hat the link partner requires PoE, the Etherne t switch must \nenable inline-power on this port, independent of the PHY.\n5. The PHY automatically disables inline-powered device detectio n when the VSC8514-11 register \nbits 23E1.9:8 automatically reset to 10, and then automatically  changes to its normal \nautonegotiation process. A link is then autonegotiated and esta blished when the lin k status bit is \nset (register bit 1. 2 is set to 1).SMIControlProcessor\nPHY_port1QSGMII \nInterface\nInline,\nPower-Over-Ethernet\n(PoE)\nPower Supply\nCat5Gigabit Switch\nPHY_port0 PHY_port n\nTransformer\nRJ-45\nI/FTransformer\nRJ-45\nI/FTransformer\nRJ-45\nI/F\nLink\nPartnerLink\nPartnerLink\nPartner\nIEEE 802.3af Pow er Over Ethe rnet Support\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 9\n6. In the event of a lin k failure (indicated when VSC8514-11 reg ister bit 1.2 reads 0), it is \nrecommended that the inline-power be disabled to the inline-pow ered device, independent of the \nPHY. The VSC8514-11 PHY disables its normal autonegotiation pro cess and re-enables its inline-\npowered device detection mode.\n2.6 IEEE 802.3af Power Over Ethernet Support\nThe VSC8514-11 device is compati ble with designs that are inten ded for use in syst ems that supply \npower to data terminal equipment (DTE) by means of the MDI or t wisted pair cable, as described in IEEE \n802.3af Clause 33.\n2.7 ActiPHY Power Management\nIn addition to the IEEE-specifi ed power-down control bit (device  register bit 0.11), the VSC8514-11 \ndevice also includes an ActiPHY power management mode for each PHY. This mode enables support for \npower-sensitive applications. It  utilizes a signal-detect funct ion that monitors the m edia interface for the \npresence of a link to determine when to automatically power-dow n the PHY. The PHY wakes up at a \nprogrammable interval and attempts  to wake up the link partner PHY by sending a burst of fast link pulse \nover copper media.\nThe ActiPHY power management mode in the VSC8514-11 is enabled on a per-port basis during normal \noperation at any time by se tting register bit 28.6 to 1.\nThe following operating states are possible when ActiPHY mode i s enabled:\n• Low-power state\n• Link partner wake-up state\n• Normal operating st ate (link-up state)\nThe VSC8514-11 switches between the low-power state and link pa rtner wake-up state at a \nprogrammable rate (t he default is two seconds) until signal ene rgy has been detec ted on the media \ninterface pins. When signal ene rgy is detected, the PHY enters the normal operating st ate. If the PHY is \nin its normal operating state and the link fails, the PHY retur ns to the low-power state after the expiration \nof the link status time-out timer . After reset, the PHY enters the low-power state.\nWhen autonegotiation is enabled in  the PHY, the ActiPHY state m achine operates as described. \nWhen autonegotiation is disabled an d the link is forced to use 10BASE-T or 100BASE- TX modes while \nthe PHY is in its low-power state, the PHY continues to transit ion between the low-power and link partner \nwake-up states until signal energ y is detected on the media pin s. At that time, the PHY transitions to the \nnormal operating state and stays in that state even when the li nk is dropped. \nWhen autonegotiation is disabled wh ile the PHY is in the normal  operation state, the PHY stays in that \nstate when the link is dropped an d does not transition back to the low-power state.\nThe following illustration shows  the relationship between ActiP HY states and timers.\nSerial Management Interface\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 10\nFigure 7 • ActiPHY State Diagram\n2.7.1 Low-Power State\nIn the low-power state, all majo r digital blocks are powered do wn. However, the SMI interface (MDC, \nMDIO, and MDINT) functionality is provided.\nIn this state, t he PHY monitors the media interface pins for si gnal energy. The PHY comes out of low-\npower state and transitions to t he normal operatin g state when signal energy is detected on the media. \nThis happens when the PHY is conn ected to one of the following:\n• Autonegotiation-capable link partner\n• Another PHY in enhanced ActiPH Y link partner wake-up state\nIn the absence of signal energy on the media pins, the PHY peri odically transitions from low-power state \nto link partner wake-up state, based on the programmable sleep timer (register bit s 20E1.14:13). The \nactual sleep time durat ion is randomized from –80 ms to 60 ms to avoid two linked PHYs in ActiPHY \nmode entering a lock-up s tate during operation.\n2.7.2 Link Partner Wake-Up State\nIn the link partner wake-up state, the PHY attempts to wake up the link partner. Up to three complete fast \nlink pulse bursts are sent on al ternating pairs A and B of the Cat5 media for a duration based on the \nwake-up timer, which is set us ing register bits 20E1.12:11.\nIn this state, SMI interface (MDC, MDIO, and MDINT) functionali ty is provided.\nAfter sending signal energy on the relevant media, the PHY retu rns to the low-power state.\n2.7.3 Normal Operating State\nIn the normal operating state, t he PHY establis hes a link with a link partner. When the media is \nunplugged or the link partner is  powered down, the PHY waits for the duration of the programmable link \nstatus time-out timer, which is set using register bit 28.7 and bit 28.2. It then enters the low-power state.\n2.8 Serial Management Interface\nThe VSC8514-11 device includes a n IEEE 802.3-compliant serial ma nagement interface (SMI) that is \ncontrolled by its MDC, MDIO, and M DINT pins. The SMI provides access to device co ntrol and status \nregisters. The register set that controls the SMI consists of 3 2 16-bit registers, including all required Low Power State\nLP Wake-up\nStateNormal\nOperation StateSignal Energy Detected on\nMedia\nTimeout Timer Expires and\nAuto-negotiation EnabledSleep Timer ExpiresFLP Burst or\nClause 37 Restart\nSignal Sent\nSerial Management Interface\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 11\nIEEE-specified registers. Also, t here are additional pages of r egisters accessible using device register \n31.\nEnergy efficient Ethernet control registers are available throu gh the SMI using Clause 45 registers and \nClause 22 register access in regi sters 13 through 14. For infor mation about available register settings, \nsee Table 24 on page 3-33  and Table 72 on page 3-62 .\nThe SMI is a synchronou s serial interface with input data to th e VSC8514-11 on the MDIO pin that is \nclocked on the rising edge of the MDC pin. The output data is s ent on the MDIO pin on the rising edge of \nthe MDC signal. The in terface can be clocked at a rate from 0 MHz to 12.5 MHz, depending on the total \nload on MDIO. An external 2-k Ω pull-up resistor is required on the MDIO pin.\n2.8.1 SMI Frames\nData is transferred over the S MI using 32-bit f rames with an op tional, arbitrary-le ngth preamble. Before \nthe first frame can be sent, at  least two clock pulses on MDC must be provided with the MDIO signal at \nlogic one to initialize the SM I state machine. The following il lustrations show the SMI frame format for \nread and write operations.\nFigure 8 • SMI Read Frame\nFigure 9 • SMI Write Frame\nThe following list defines the te rms used in the SMI read and w rite timing diagrams.\n•Idle During idle, the MDIO node goes to a high-impedance state. This  allows an external pull-up \nresistor to pull the MDIO node up to a logical 1 state. Because  the idle mode does not contain any \ntransitions on MDIO, the number of bits is undefined during idl e.\n•Preamble By default, preambles are not expected or required. The preambl e is a string of ones. \nIf it exists, the preamble mus t be at least 1 bit ; otherwise, it  can be of an arbitrary length.\n•Start of Frame Delimiter (SFD) A pattern of 01 indicates the start of fram e. If the pattern is  not \n01, all following bits are ignor ed until the next preamble patt ern is detected.\n•Read or Write Opcode A pattern of 10 indicates a read. A 01 pattern indicates a writ e. If the bits \nare not either 01 or 10, all f ollowing bits are ignored until t he next preamble pattern is detected.\n•PHY Address The particular VSC8514-11 device responds to a message frame on ly when the \nreceived PHY address matches its  physical address.

During read operations, the VSC8514-11 device \ndrives the second TA bit, a logical 0.\n•Data The 16-bits read from or written to the device are considered the data or dat a stream. \nWhen data is read from a PHY, i t is valid at the output from on e rising edge of MDC to the next \nrising edge of MDC. When data is wr itten to the P HY, it must be valid around th e rising edge of \nMDC.\n•Idle The sequence is repeated.\n2.8.2 SMI Interrupt\nThe SMI includes an out put interrupt signal , MDINT, for signali ng the station manager when certain \nevents occur in the VSC8514-11.\nWhen a PHY generates an interrupt , the MDINT pin is asserted if  the interrupt pin enable bit (MII register \n25.15) is set. The MDINT pin c an be configured f or open-drain ( active-low) by tying the pin to a pull-up \nresistor and to VDDIO. The follo wing illustration shows this co nfiguration.\nFigure 10 • MDINT Configured as an Ope n-Drain (Active-Low) Pin\n2.9 LED Interface\nThe LED interface s upports the following c onfigurations: direct  drive, basic serial LED mode, and \nenhanced serial LED mode. The po larity of the LED outputs is pr ogrammable and can be changed using \nregister 17E2, bits 13:10. The default polar ity is active low.\nDirect drive mode provides four LED  signals per port, LED0_[0:3 ] through LED3_[0:3]. The mode and \nfunction of each LED signal c an be configured independently. Wh en serial LED mode is enabled, the \ndirect drive pins not used by the serial LED  interface remain a vailable.\nIn basic serial LED mode, all si gnals that can be  displayed on LEDs are sent as LED_Data and \nLED_CLK for external processing. In enhanced serial LED mode, up to four LED signals per port ca n be sent as LED_Data, LED_CLK, \nLED_LD, and LED_Pulse.

This \noption is enabled by setting LED0 on PHY0 to serial LED mode in  register 29, bits 3:0 to 0xD. When \nserial LED mode is enabled, the LED0_0 pin becomes the serial data pin, and the LED1_0 pin becomes \nthe serial clock pin. All other LED pins can still be configure d normally. The serial LED mode clocks the \n48 LED status bits on the rising edge of the serial clock.\nThe LED behavior setting s can also be used in serial LED mode. The controls are used on a per-PHY \nbasis, where the LED combine and LED blink or pulse-stretch set ting of LED0_n for each PHY is used to \ncontrol the behavior o f each bit of t he serial LED stream for e ach corresponding PHY. To configure LED \nbehavior, set device register 30.\nThe following table shows the 48-b it serial output bitstream of  each LED signal. The individual signals \ncan be clocked in the following order.7 Reserved Reserved\n8 Duplex/Collision 1: Link established in half-duplex mode, or no  link established.\n0: Link established in full-duplex mode.\nBlink or pulse-stretch = Link established in half-duplex mode \nbut collisions are present.\n9 Collision 1: No collision detected.\nBlink or pulse-stretch = Collision detected.\n10 Activity 1: No activity present.\nBlink or pulse-stretch = Activit y present (becomes TX activity \npresent when register b it 30.14 is set to 1).\n11 Reserved Reserved\n12 Autonegotiation Fault 1: No aut onegotiation fault present.\n0: Autonegotiation fault occurred.\n13 Serial Mode Serial stream.

Each of these bit s enables extended \nmodes on a specific LED pin, and these extended modes are shown  in the following ta ble. For example, \nLED0 = mode 17 means that register 19E1 bit 12 = 1 and register 29 b its 3 to 0 = 0001.\nThe following table provides a s ummary of the extended LED mode s and functions.\n2.9.4 LED Port Swapping\nFor additional hardware configurations, the VSC8514-11 can have  its LED port order swapped. This is a \nuseful feature to help simplify PC B layout design. Register 25G  bit 0 controls the LED port swapping \nmode.\n2.9.5 LED Behavior\nSeveral LED behaviors can be pr ogrammed into the VSC8514-11. Us e the settings in register 30 and \n19E1 to program LED behavior, which includes the following:\n2.9.5.1 LED Combine\nEnables an LED to display the sta tus for a combination of prima ry and secondary mo des. This can be \nenabled or disabled for each LED pin. For example, a copper lin k running in 1000BASE-T mode and \nactivity present can be displayed  with one LED by configuring a n LED pin to Link1000/Activity mode. The \nLED asserts when linked to a 1000BASE-T part ner and also blinks  or performs pulse-stretch when \nactivity is either transmitted by the PHY or received by the Li nk Partner. When d isabled, the combine \nfeature only provides status of t he selected primary function. In this example, only Link1000 asserts the \nLED, and the secondary mode, activity, does not display when th e combine feat ure is disabled.R e s e r v e d 9 2 13 34 5\nT x  a c t i v i t y 1 02 23 44 6\nRx activity 11 23 35 47\nAutonegotiation fault 12 24\nTable 6 • Extended LED Mode and Function Summary\nMode Function Name LED State and Description\n16 Link1000BASE-X Activity 1: No link in 1000BASE-X.\n0: Valid 100 0BASE-X link.\n17 Link100BASE-FX Activity 1: No link in 100BASE-FX.\n0: Valid 100BASE-FX link.\n18 1000BASE-X Activity 1: No 1000BASE-X activity present.\nBlink or pulse-stretch = 1000BASE-X activity present.\n19 100BASE-FX Activity 1: No 1 00BASE-FX activity present.\nBlink or pulse-stretch = 100 BASE-FX activity present.\n20 Force LED Off 1: De-asserts the LED.\n21 Force LED On 0: Asserts the LED.

Th is can be uniquely configured for each LED \npin. Activity and collision event s can occur randomly and inter mittently throughout  the link-up period. \nBlink is a 50% duty cycle oscillation of asserti ng and de-asser ting an LED pin. Pulse -stretch guarantees \nthat an LED is asserted and de-a sserted for a specific period o f time when activity is either present or not \npresent. These rates can also be configured using a register setting.\n2.9.5.3 Rate of LED Bl ink or Pulse-Stretch\nThis behavior controls the LED b link rate or pulse-stretch leng th when blink/pulse-stretch is enabled on \nan LED pin. The blink  rate, which alterna tes between a high and  low voltage level at  a 50% duty cycle, \ncan be set to 2.5 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz,  or 20 Hz. For pulse-stretch, the  rate can be set to 50 ms, 100 ms, \n200 ms, or 400 ms. The blink rate  selection for PHY0 globally set s the rate used for all LED pins on all \nPHY ports.\n2.9.5.3.1 LED Pulsing Enable\nTo provide additional power savin gs, the LEDs (when asserted) c an be pulsed at 5 kH z, 20% duty cycle.\n2.9.5.3.2 LED Blink After Reset\nThe LEDs will blink fo r one second after power-up and after any  time all resets have been de-asserted. \nThis can be disabled throu gh register 19E1, bit 11 = 0.\n2.9.5.3.3 Pulse Programmable Control\nThese bits add the abi lity to width and frequency of LED pulses . This feature facilitates power reduction \noptions.\n2.10 GPIO Pins\nThe VSC8514-11 provides  15 multiplexed gener al purpose input/ou tput (GPIO) pins. All device GPIO \npins and their behavior are cont rolled using regi sters. The fol lowing table shows an overview of the \nregister controls for GPIO pin s.

This section descri bes the available features.\n2.11.1 Ethernet Packet Generator\nThe Ethernet packet generator ( EPG) can be used at each of the 10/100/1000BASE-T speed settings for \ncopper Cat5 media to isolate pro blems between the MAC and the V SC8514-11, or between a locally \nconnected PHY and its remote link partner. Enabling the EPG fea ture disables all MAC interface transmit \npins and selects the EPG as the source for all data transmitted  onto the twiste d pair interface.\nImportant The EPG is intended for use with laboratory or in-system testin g equipment only. Do not use \nthe EPG testing feature when the VSC8514-11 is connected to a l ive network.\nTo enable the VSC8514-11 EPG feature, set the device register b it 29E1.15 to 1.\nWhen the EPG is enabled, packet l oss occurs during transmission  of packets from the MAC to the PHY. \nHowever, the PHY receive output pins to the MAC are still activ e when the EPG is ena bled. When it is \nnecessary to disable the MAC receive pins as well, set the regi ster bit 0.10 to 1.\nWhen the device register bit 29E1 .14 is set to 1, the PHY begins  transmitting Ethernet packets based on \nthe settings in registers 29E1 and 30E1. These registers set:\n• Source and destination addresses for each packet\n• Packet size\n• Interpacket gap\n• FCS state\n• Transmit duration• Payload pattern\nWhen register bit 29E1.13 is set t o 0, register bit 29E1.14 is cleared automatically after 30,000,000 \npackets are transmitted.\n2.11.2 CRC Counters\nTwo sets of cyclical redundancy check (CRC) counters are available in all PHYs in VSC8514-11. One set \nmonitors traffic on the copper i nterface, and the other set mon itors traffic on the SerDes interface.\nThe device CRC counters operat e in the 10/100/ 1000BASE-T mode a s follows:\n• After receiving a packet on the media interface, register bit 1 5 in register 18E1 is set and cleared \nafter being read.\n• The packet then is counted by e ither the good CRC counter or t he bad CRC counter. \n• Both CRC counters are also automatically cleared when read.\n• The good CRC counter’s highest va lue is 9,999 packets. After t his value is reached, the counter \nclears on the 10,000th packet and continues to count additional packets beyond that v alue. \n• The bad CRC counter stops count ing when it reaches its maximum counter limit of 255 packets.\n2.11.2.0.1 Copper Interface CRC Counters\nTwo separate CRC counters are available between the copper inte rface PCSs and SerDes MAC \ninterface. There is a 14-bit good CRC counter available through  register bits 18E1. 13:0 and a separate \n8-bit bad CRC counter availabl e in register bits 23E1.7:0.\n2.11.3 Far-End Loopback\nThe far-end loopback testing fe ature is enabled by setting regi ster bit 23.3 to 1. When enabled, it forces \nincoming data from a link partner  on the current media interface into the MAC interface of the PHY where \nit is retransmitted to the link partner on the media interface as shown in the following illustration. In \nTesting Features\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 18\naddition, the incoming data also  appears on the receive data pi ns of the MAC interfac e. Data present on \nthe transmit data pins of the MAC interface is ignored when usi ng this testing feature.\nFigure 11 • Far-End Loopback Diagram\n2.11.4 Near-End Loopback\nWhen the near-end loopback testing feature is enabled, transmit ted data (TXD) is looped back in the \nPCS block onto the receive data  signals (RXD), as shown in the following illustration. When using this \ntesting feature, no data is transmitted ov er the network. To en able near-end loopback, set the device \nregister bit 0.14 to 1.\nFigure 12 • Near-End Loopback Diagram\n2.11.5 Connector Loopback\nThe connector loopback testing feature allows the twisted pair interface to be looped back externally. \nWhen using this feature, the PHY  must be connec ted to a loopbac k connector or a loopback cable. \nConnect pair A to pair B, and pai r C to pair D, as shown in the  following illustration. The connector \nloopback feature functions at all available interface speeds.Figure 13 • Connector Loopback Diagram\nWhen using the connector loopback testing feature,  the device a utonegotiation, speed, and duplex \nconfiguration is set  using device registers 0, 4, and 9. \nFor 1000BASE-T connector loopback , additional writes are required in the following order:\n1. Enable the 1000BASE- T connector loopback. Set register bit 24. 0 to 1.\n2. Disable pair swap correction. Set register bit 18.5 to 1.\n2.11.6 SerDes Loopbacks\nFor test purposes, the SerDes and SerDes macro interfaces provi des several data loops.

Individual port loopback within \na QSGMII is not possible.\n2.11.6.1.1 Facility Loop\nThe recovered and de-multiplexer deserializer data output is lo oped back to the serializer data input and \nreplaces the data delivered by the digital core. This test loop  provides the possibility to test the complete \nanalog macro data path from out side including input buffer, clo ck and data recovery, serialization and \noutput buffer. The data received  by the input buffer must be tr ansmitted by the output buffer after some \ndelay.Additional configuration of the enhanced SerDes macro is required when selecting facility loopback \nmode. Run the “set = 1” option when entering facility loopback mode and the “set = 0” option when exiting facility loopback mode. Execute this additional configu ration after running the command to \nenable/disable facility loopback mode.\nPhyWrite(PhyBaseAddr, 31, 0x0010);\nPhyWrite(PhyBaseAddr, 18, 0x8013);\nPhyWrite(PhyBaseAddr, 18, 0xd7cb);Rx-DirectData\nRxData\nRxClk\nTxData\nTxClk\nTx-DirectDataCfg/Status\nRef.-Clk\nOB\n3 Tap-FIR\ni-loop\nf-loopDES20\nSER20IB6G-SerDes\nTCE\ne-loop\nTx(p,n)Rx(p,n)ESDReceiver\nTransmitter\nESDRCPLLCDRIB\n(sample \nstage)\nbidi-loop\nTesting Features\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 20\nPhyWrite(PhyBaseAddr, 18, 0x8007);\ntmp1 = PhyRead(PhyBaseAddr, 18);tmp2 = tmp1 & 0x0ff0;\nif (set)\n    tmp3 = tmp2 | 0x0100;else\n    tmp3 = tmp2 & 0x0ef0;\ntmp4 = tmp3 | 0x8006;\nPhyWrite(PhyBaseAddr, 18, tmp4);\nPhyWrite(PhyBaseAddr, 18, 0x9c40);// PhyBaseAddr is the 5-bit base address of the internal PHYs. \n// The upper 3 bits are set by the PHYADD[4:2] pins and the // lower 2 bits are 0.\n2.11.6.1.2 Equipment Loop\nThe 1-bit data stream at the serializer output is looped back t o the deserializer and replaces the received \ndata stream from the input buffer. This test loop provides the possibility to verify th e digital data path \ninternally. The transmit data goe s through the serialization, t he clock and data recovery, and \ndeserialization before the data is fed back to the digital core .\n2.11.6.1.3 Input Loop\nThe received 1-bit data stream of the input buffer is looped ba ck asynchronously to the output buffer. This \ntest loop provides the possibili ty to test only the analog part s of the QSGMII interface because only the \ninput and output buffer are part of this loop.\n2.11.7 VeriPHY Cable Diagnostics\nThe VSC8514-11 device includes a c omprehensive suite of cable d iagnostic functions that are available \nusing SMI reads and writes. These functions enable a variety of  status and cable opera ting conditions to \nbe accessed and checked. The Veri PHY suite has the ability to i dentify the cable length and operating \nconditions and to isol ate a variety of common faults that can o ccur on the Cat5 twis ted pair cabling.\nNote When a link is established on the twisted pair interface in the  1000BASE-T mode, VeriPHY can \nrun without disrupting the link or disrupti ng any data transfer . However, when a link is established in \n100BASE-TX or 10BASE-T modes, VeriP HY causes the link to drop w hile the diagnostics are running. \nAfter diagnostics are finished , the link is re-established.\nThe following diagnostic function s are part of the VeriPHY suit e:\n• Detecting coupling between cable pairs\n• Detecting cable pair termination\n• Determining cable length\n• Mean square error noise\n2.11.7.1 Coupling Be tween Cable Pairs\nShorted wires, improper termination, or high crosstalk resultin g from an incorrect wire map can cause \nerror conditions such as anomal ous coupling between cable pairs . These conditions can prevent the \ndevice from establishing a link in any speed.\n2.11.7.2 Cable Pair Termination\nProper termination of Cat5 cable requires a 100 Ω differential impedance between the pos itive and \nnegative cable terminals. IEEE 8 02.3 allows for a termination of 115 Ω maximum and 85 Ω minimum. If \nthe termination falls outside of  this range, it is reported by the VeriPHY diagnosti cs as an anomalous \ntermination. The diagnostics can also determine the presence of  an open or shorted cable pair.\n2.11.7.3 Cable Length\nWhen the Cat5 cable in an instal lation is properl y terminated, VeriPHY reports the approximate cable \nlength in meters. If there is a ca ble fault, the distance to th e fault is reported. Cable length is reliable to \n120 m.\nTesting Features\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 21\n2.11.7.4 Mean Square Error Noise\nThe average absolute error can  be read out when either a 100BAS E-TX or 1000BASE-T link is \nestablished. In t he case of 1000BASE-T lin k, there are two aver age absolute error terms, one for each \ntwisted pair over which signal is  received. Use the following s cript to read average absolute error for \n100BASE-TX:\nPhyWrite(<phy>, 31, 0x52b5);\nPhyWrite(<phy>, 16, 0xa3c0);\nPhyRead(<phy>, 16);tmp17 = PhyRead(<phy>, 17);\ntmp18 = PhyRead(<phy>, 18);\nmse = (tmp18 << 4) | (tmp17 >> 12);PhyWrite(<phy>, 31, 0);\nThe returned average absolute error is in units of 1/2,048 and can be found in t he mse variable.\nPhyWrite(<phy>, 31, 0x52b5);\nPhyWrite(<phy>, 16, 0xa3c0);PhyRead(<phy>, 16);\ntmp17 = PhyRead(<phy>, 17);\ntmp18 = PhyRead(<phy>, 18);mseA = (tmp18 << 4) | (tmp17 >> 12);\nmseB = tmp17 & 0x0fff;\nPhyWrite(<phy>, 16, 0xa3c2);PhyRead(<phy>, 16);\ntmp17 = PhyRead(<phy>, 17);\ntmp18 = PhyRead(<phy>, 18);mseC = (tmp18 << 4) | (tmp17 >> 12);\nmseD = tmp17 & 0x0fff;\nPhyWrite(<phy>, 31, 0);\nThe returned average absolute error is in units of 1/2,048 and can be found in the mseA, mseB, mseC, \nand mseD variables fo r each twisted pair.\n2.11.8 JTAG Boundary Scan\nThe VSC8514-11 support s the test access port (TAP) and boundary scan architecture described in \nIEEE 1149.1. The device includes  an IEEE 1149.1-compliant test interface, referred to as a JTAG TAP \ninterface.\nThe JTAG boundary scan logic on the VSC8514-11, accessed using its TAP interface, consists of a \nboundary scan register  and other logic cont rol blocks. The TAP controller includes all IEEE-required \nsignals (TMS, TCK, TDI, and TDO) , in addition to the optional a synchronous reset signal TRST. The \nfollowing illustration shows t he TAP and boundary scan architec ture.\nImportant When JTAG is not in us e, the TRST pin must b e tied to ground wi th a pull-down resistor for \nnormal operation.\nTesting Features\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 22\nFigure 15 • Test Access Port and Boundary Scan Architecture\nAfter a TAP reset, the device id entification register is serial ly connected between TDI and TDO by \ndefault. The TAP instruction re gister is loaded from a shift re gister when a new instruction is shifted in, or \nif there is no new instruction in the shift register, a default  value of 6\'b100100 (IDCODE) is loaded. Using \nthis method, there is always a valid code in the instruction re gister, and the problem of toggling \ninstruction bits during a shift is avoided. Unused codes are ma pped to the BYPASS instruction.\n2.11.9 JTAG Instruction Codes\nThe following table shows the supported JTAG instruction codes.\nTable 8 • JTAG Instruction Codes\nInstruction Code Description\nBYPASS The bypass register contains a single shift-register stage and is used to provide \na minimum-length serial path (one TCK clock period) between TDI  and TDO to \nbypass the device when no test operation is required.\nCLAMP Allows the state of the signals driven  from the component pins to be \ndetermined from the boundary scan register while the bypass reg ister is \nselected as the serial path between TDI and TDO. While the CLAM P \ninstruction is select ed, the signals driven  from the component pins do not \nchange.\nEXTEST Allows tests of  the off-chip circuit ry and board-level in terconnections by \nsampling input pins and loading data onto output  pins. Outputs are driven by \nthe contents of the boundary scan  cells, which have to be updat ed with valid \nvalues, with the PRELOAD instr uction, prior to the EXTEST instr uction.Boundary Scan\nRegister\nTest Access Port\nControllerControl\nSelectTDO EnableTDI\nTMS\nNTRST\nTCKControl MUX,\nDFFTDO\nInstruction Register,\nInstruction Decode\nControlBypass RegisterDevice Identification\nRegister\nTesting Features\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 23\nThe following table provides i nformation about the USERCODE bin ary values stored in  the device JTAG \nregister.\nThe following table provides information about the location and  IEEE compliance of the JTAG instruction \ncodes used in the VSC 8514-11.

For more \ninformation about these IEEE specif ications, visit the IEEE Web s ite at www.IEEE.org.\n2.11.10 Boundary Scan Register Cell Order\nAll inputs and outputs are observed in the boundary scan regist er cells. All outputs are additionally driven \nby the contents of boundary scan register cells. Bidirectional pins have all three related boundary scan \nregister cells: input, output, and control.\nThe complete boundary scan cell o rder is available as a BSDL fi le on the Micros emi Web site.HIGHZ Places the component in a sta te in which all of its system  logic outputs are \nplaced in a high-impedance state. In this state, an in-circuit test system can \ndrive signals onto the connections normally driven by a compone nt output \nwithout incurring a risk of dam age to the compon ent. This makes  it possible to \nuse a board where not all of the  components are compatible with  the \nIEEE 1149.1 standard.\nIDCODE Provides the version numbe r (bits 31:28), device family ID (bits 27:12), and the \nmanufacturer identity (bits 11:1) to be serially read from the device.\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD Allows a snapshot of inputs and outputs during no rmal system operation to be \ntaken and examined.

To configure the devi ce, perform the following steps :\n1. COMA_MODE active, drive high.\n2. Apply power.\n3. Apply RefClk.\n4. Release reset, drive high. Powe r and clock must be stable bef ore releasing reset.\n5. Wait 120 ms, minimum.6. Apply patch from PHY_API.7.

Read register 0 (to access register 0, regis ter 31 must be 0). S et bit 15 to 1.\nWrite new register 0.\n11. Read register 0 until bit 15 equals 0.\n12. Release the COMA_MODE pin, drive low.\n2.12.1 Initialization\nThe COMA_MODE pin provides an optional feature that may be used  to control when the PHYs become \nactive. The typical usage is to  keep the PHYs from becoming act ive before they have been fully \ninitialized. For more information, see "Configuration" on page 2-24 . Alternatively the COMA_MODE pin \nmay be connected low (ground) so that the PHYs are fully active  once out of reset.\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 25\n3R e g i s t e r s\nThis section provides informati on about how to configure the VS C8514-11 device using its internal \nmemory registers and the managemen t interface. The registers ma rked reserved and factory test should \nnot be read or written to, bec ause doing so may  produce undesir ed effects.\nThe default value documented for registers is based on the valu e at reset; however, i n some cases, that \nvalue may change immediately after reset.\nThe access type for each regist er is shown using the following abbreviations:\n• RO: Read Only\n• ROCR: Read Only, Clear on Read• RO/LH: Read Only, Latch High\n• RO/LL: Read Only, Latch Low\n• RW: Read and Write• RWSC: Read Write Self Clearing\nThe VSC8514-11 device uses sever al different types of registers:\n• IEEE Clause 22 device registers with addr esses from 0 to 31\n• Three pages of extend ed registers with addresses from 16E1–30E 1, 16E2–30E2, and 16E3–\n30E3\n• General-purpose registers w ith addresses from 0G to 30G\n• IEEE Clause 45 devices registers a ccessible through the Clause 22 registers 13 and 14 to \nsupport IEEE 802.3az energy ef ficient Ethernet registers\nThe following illustration shows  the relationship between the d evice registers and t heir address spaces.\nFigure 16 • Register Space Diagram\nReserved Registers\nFor main registers 16–31, exten ded registers 16E1–30E1, 16E2–30 E2, 16E3–30E3, and general \npurpose registers 0G–30G, any bi ts marked as Reserved should be  processed as read-only and their \nstates as undefined.IEEE 802.3 \nStandard \nRegisters\nMain Registers\n0x00000\n1\n2\n3\n.\n.\n.\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n30\n31Extended\nRegisters 1\n0x000116E1\n17E1\n18E1\n19E1\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n30E1Extended\nRegisters 2\n0x000216E2\n17E2\n18E2\n19E2\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n30E2Extended\nRegisters 3\n0x000316E3\n17E3\n18E3\n19E3\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n30E3General Purpose \nRegisters\n0x00100G\n1G\n2G\n3G\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n15G\n16G\n17G\n18G\n19G\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n30GClause 45\nRegisters\nRegister and Bit Conventions\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 26\nReserved Bits\nIn writing to registers with reserved bits, use a read-modify-t hen-write technique, where the entire \nregister is read but only the in tended bits to be changed are m odified. Reserved bits cannot be changed \nand their read state cannot be considered static or unchanging.\n3.1 Register and Bit Conventions\nRegisters are referred to by their address and bit number in decimal notation. A range of bits is indicated \nwith a colon. For example, a reference to address 26, bits 15 t hrough 14 is shown as 26.15:14.\nA register with an E and a number attached (example 27E1) means  it is a register contained within \nextended register page number 1.

When set to 01, the sque lch level is decreased, which  can improve the bit error rate \nperformance on long loops. When set to 10, the squelch level is  increased and can improve the \nbit error rate in high-noise environments.\n• When bit 22.9 is set, all sticky register bits retain their val ues during a software reset. Clearing this \nbit causes all sticky register b its to change to  their default values upon software reset. Super-\nsticky bits retain their values  upon software reset regardless of the setting of bit 22.9.\n• When bit 22.0 is set, if a write  to any PHY register (registers 0–31, including ext ended registers), \nthe same write is broadcast to all PHYs. For example, if bit 22. 0 is set to 1 and a write to PHY0 is \nexecuted (register 0 is set to 0x1040), all PHYs\' register 0s a re set to 0x1040. Disabling this bit \nrestores normal PHY write opera tion. Reads are still possible w hen this bit is set, but the value \nthat is read corresponds only to the particular PHY being addre ssed.\n3.2.21 Extended PHY Control Set 1\nThe following table shows the settings available.12 Disable SQE mode R/W Sticky bit.\n1: Disable SQE mode1\n11:10 10BASE-T squelch control R/W Sticky bit.\n00: Normal squelch\n01: Low squelch10: High squelch\n11: Reserved00\n9 Sticky reset enable R/W Super-sticky bit.\n1: Enabled1\n8 EOF Error RO This bit is self-clearing.\n1: EOF error detected0\n7 10BASE-T disconnect state RO This bit is self-clearing.1: 10BASE-T link di sconnect detected0\n6 10BASE-T link status RO 1: 10BASE-T link active 0\n5:1 Reserved RO Reserved0 SMI broadcast write R/W Sticky bit.\n1: Enabled0\nTable 34 • Extended PHY Control 1, Address 23 (0x17)\nBit Name Access Description Default15:11 Reserved R/W Reserved 010:8 Media operating mode R/W Super-sticky bits\n000: Cat5 copper only000\n7:4 Reserved RO Reserved\n3 Far-end loopback mode R/W 1: Enabled 0Table 33 • Extended Control and Status, Address 22 (0x16)  (continued)\nBit Name Access Description Default\nIEEE 802.3 and Main Registers\nVMDS-10446 VSC8514-11 Datasheet Revision 4.0 38\nNote After configuring bits 11:8 of the extended PHY control registe r set 1, a software reset (register 0, \nbit 15) must be written to change the device operating mode.
