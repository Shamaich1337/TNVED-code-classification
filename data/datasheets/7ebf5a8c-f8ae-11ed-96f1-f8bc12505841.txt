Detailed information on the KNX Bus can be\nfound on the KNX website ( www.knx.org\n) and in the KNX\nstandards.\nKNX Bus Interfacing\nEach bit period is 104 /C0109s. Logic 1 is simply the DC level\nof the bus voltage which is between 20 V and 33 V. Logic 0\nis encoded as a drop in the bus voltage with respect to the DC\nlevel. Logic 0 is known as the active pulse.The active pulse is produced by the transmitter and is\nideally rectangular. It has a duration of 35 /C0109s and a depth\nbetween 6 and 9 V (V act). Each active pulse is followed by\nan equalization pulse with a duration of 69 /C0109s. The latter is\nan abrupt jump of the bus voltage above the DC levelfollowed by an exponential decay down to the DC level. The\nequalization pulse is characterized by its height V\neq and the\nvoltage V end reached at the end of the equalization pulse.\nSee the KNX Twisted Pair Standard (KNX TP1 −256) for\nmore detailed KNX information.\nDC LevelVBUS\nt\n104/C0109s35/C0109s6 9 /C0109sActive Pulse Equalization Pulse\n104/C0109s\n01 Veq Vact\nVen d\nFigure 10. KNX Bus Voltage versus Digital Value\nKNX Bus Transmitter\nThe purpose of the transmitter is to produce an active\npulse (see Figure 10) between 6 V and 9 V regardless of the\nbus impedance (Note 1). In order to do this the transmitterwill sink as much current as necessary until the bus voltagedrops by the desired amount. The transmitter will produce\nan active pulse whenever the TX pin is brought high. It is up\nto the microcontroller to provide the bit −level coding and\nprovide the correct active pulse duration.\nKNX Bus Receiver\nThe receiver detects the beginning and the end of the\nactive pulse. The detection threshold for the start of the\nactive pulse is −0.45 V (typ.) below the average bus voltage.\nThe detection threshold for the end of the active pulse is−0.2 V (typ.) below the average bus voltage giving a\nhysteresis of 0.25 V (typ.). The result of this detection isavailable as a pulse on the RXD pin.\nBus Coupler\nThe role of the bus coupler is to extract the DC voltage\nfrom the bus and provide a stable voltage supply for thepurpose of powering the NCN5110. This stable voltagesupplied by the bus coupler is called VFILT, and will followthe average bus voltage. The bus coupler also makes sure\nthat the current drawn from the bus changes very slowly. For\nthis a large filter capacitor is used on the VFILT −pin. Abrupt\nload current steps are absorbed by the filter capacitor.\nLong−term stability requires that the average bus coupler\ninput current is equal to the average (bus coupler) load\ncurrent. This is shown by the parameter /C0068I\ncoupler //C0068t, which\nindicated the bus current slope limit. The bus coupler willalso limit the current to a maximum of I\ncoupler_lim . At\nstartup, this current limit is increased to I coupler_lim,startup  to\nallow for fast charging of the VFILT bulk capacitance.\nThere are 4 conditions that determine the dimensioning of\nthe VFILT capacitor.\nFirst, the capacitor value should be between 12.5 /C0109F and\n4000 /C0109F to garantuee proper operation of the part.\nThe next requirement on the VFILT capacitor is\ndetermined by the startup time of the system. According tothe KNX specification, the total startup time must be below10s. This time is comprised of the time to charge the VFILT\ncapacitor to 12 V (where the DCDC convertor becomes\noperatonal) and the startup time of the rest of the systemt\nstartup,system . This gives the following formula:\n1. Maximum bus impedance is specified in the KNX Twisted Pair Standard\nNCN5110\nwww. onsemi.com\n15C/C0116/C046610s/C0042tstartup,system/C0467/C0032Icoupler_lim,startup\nVFILTH\nThe third limit on VFILT capacitor value is the required\ncapacitor value to filter out current steps /C0068Istep of the system\nwithout going into reset.\nC/C0117/C0068Istep2\n/C04662/C0032/C0466VBUS1/C0042Vcoupler_drop/C0042VFILTL/C0467/C0032Islope/C0467\nThe last condition on the size of VFILT is the desired\nwarning time twarning between SA VEB and RESETB incase the bus voltage drops away. This is determined by the\ncurrent consumption of the system Isystem.\nC/C0117Isystem/C0032/C0466twarning/C0041tbusfilter/C0467\n/C0466VBUS1/C0042Vcoupler_drop/C0042VFILTL/C0467\nThe bus coupler is implemented as a linear voltage\nregulator. For ef ficiency purpose, the voltage drop over the\nbus coupler is kept minimal (see Table 4).\nKNX Impedance Control\nThe impedance control circuit defines the impedance of\nthe bus device during the active and equalization pulses. Theimpedance can be divided into a static and a dynamic\ncomponent, the latter being a function of time. The static\nimpedance defines the load for the active pulse current and\nthe equalization pulse current. The dynamic impedance isproduced by a block, called an equalization pulse generator,\nthat reduces the device current consumption (i.e. increasesthe device impedance) as a function of time during theequalization phase so as to return energy to the bus.\nFixed and Adjustable DC −DC Converter\nThe device contains two DC −DC buck converters, both\nsupplied from VFILT.\nDC1 provides a fixed voltage of 3.3 V. This voltage is used\nas an internal low voltage supply (V DDA and V DDD) but can\nalso be used to power external devices (VDD1 −pin). DC1 is\nautomatically enabled during the power −up procedure (see\nAnalog State Diagram, p19).\nDC2 provides a programmable voltage by means of an\nexternal resistor divider. It is not used as an internal voltage\nsupply making it not mandatory to use this DC −DC\nconverter (if not needed, tie the VDD2MV pin to VDD1).\nDC2 will only be enabled when the nDC2EN pin is pulled\nlow. When nDC2EN is pulled to VDDD, the DC2 controller\nis disabled.\nThe voltage divider can be calculated as follows:\nR4/C0043R5/C0032VDD2/C00421.2\n1.2(eq. 1)\nBoth DC−DC converters make use of slope control to\nimprove EMC performance (see Table 5). To operate DC1and DC2 correctly, the voltage on the VIN −pin should be\nhigher than the highest value of DC1 and DC2.Although both DC −DC converters are capable of\ndelivering 100 mA, the maximum current capability will not\nalways be usable. One always needs to make sure that the\nKNX bus power consumption stays within the KNX\nspecification. The maximum allowed current for the DC −DC\nconverters and V20V regulator can be estimated as next:\nVBUS/C0032/C0466IBUS/C0042I20V/C0467\n2/C0032/C0426/C0466VDD1/C0032IDD1/C0467/C0041/C0466VDD2/C0032IDD2/C0467/C0427/C01191(eq. 2)\nIBUS will be limited by the KNX standard and should be\nlower or equal to I coupler  (see Table 4). Minimum V BUS is\n20 V (see KNX standard). V DD1 and V DD2 can be found back\nin Table 4. I DD1, IDD2 and I 20V must be chosen in a correct\nway to be in line with the KNX specification (Note 2).\nAlthough DC2 can operate up to 21 V , it will not be\npossible to generate this 21 V under all operating conditions.\nSee application note AND9135 for defining the optimum\ninductor and capacitor of the DC −DC converters. When\nusing low series resistance output capacitors on DC2, it isadvised to split the current sense resistor as shown inFigure 12 to reduce ripple current for low load conditions.\nV20V Regulator\nThis is the 20 V low drop linear voltage regulator used to\nsupply external devices. As it draws current from VFILT,this current is seen without any power conversion directly at\nthe VBUS1 pin.\nThe V20V regulator is enabled by pulling the nV20VEN\npin low. When the nV20VEN pin is pulled high, the 20Vregulator is disabled. When the V20V regulator is not used,\nno load capacitor needs to be connected (see C7 of Figure 9).\nConnect V20V −pin with VFILT −pin in this case.\nThe 20 V regulator has a current limit that depends on the\nFANIN resistor value. In Table 4, the typical value of thecurrent limit at startup is given as I\n20V_lim .\nXtal Oscillator\nAn analog oscillator cell generates an optional clock of\n16 MHz.\nFigure 11. XTAL OscillatorXTAL1XTAL2\nXCLKOSC\n323534\n21\n8 MHz @ XCLC = VSS\n16 MHz @ XCLC = VDDVDD\nXCLKC\nThe XCLK −pin can be used to supply a clock signal to the\nhost controller.\n2. The formula is for a typical KNX application. It‘s only given as guidance and does not guarantee compliance with the KNX stan dard.\nNCN5110\nwww. onsemi.com\n16After power −up, a 4 MHz (Note 3) clock signal will be\npresent on the XCLK −pin during Stand −By. When Normal\nState is entered, a 8 or 16 MHz clock signal will be present\non the XCLK −pin. See also Figure 14. To output an 8 MHz\nclock on the XCLK pin, the XCLKC pin must be pulled toground. When the XCLKC pin is pulled up to V\nDDD, the\nXCLK pin will output a 16 MHz clock signal.\nWhen Normal State is left and Stand −By State is\nre−entered due to an issue different than an Xtal issue, the 8\nor 16 MHz clock signal will still be present on theXCLK−pin during the Stand −By State. If however\nStand−By is entered from Normal State due to an Xtal issue,\nthe 4 MHz clock signal will be present on the XCLK −pin.\nSee also Table 7.\nFANIN−pin\nThe FANIN −pin defines the maximum allowed bus\ncurrent and bus current slopes. If the FANIN −pin is kept\nfloating, pulled up to V DD, or pulled down with a resistance\nhigher than 250 k /C0087, NCN5110 will limit the KNX bus\ncurrent slopes to 0.5 mA/ms at all times. NCN5110 will also\nlimit the KNX bus current to 30 mA during start −up. During\nnormal operation, NCN5110 is capable of taking 10.6 mA(= I\ncoupler ) from the KNX bus for supplying external loads\n(DC1, DC2 and V20V).\nIf the FANIN −pin is pulled to ground with a resistance\nsmaller than 2 k /C0087 the operation is similar as above with the\nexception that the KNX bus current slopes will be limited to\n1 mA/ms at all times, the KNX bus current will be limitedto 60 mA during start −up and up to 20.5 mA (I\ncoupler ) can be\ntaken from the KNX bus during normal operation. When the\nFANIN−pin is pulled to ground with a resistance between\n10 k/C0087 and 93.1 k /C0087, the current slope and current limit are\ndefined by the values from Table 4. For different resistorvalues, the typical current limit can be approximated by the\nformula I bus = 0.0004 + 434/R 6 A. Using different resistor\nvalues is, however, not recommended.\nDefinitions for Start−Up and Normal Operation (as given\nabove) can be found in the KNX Specification.\nRESETB − and SAVEB −pin\nThe RESETB signal can be used to keep the host\ncontroller in a reset state. When RESETB is low this\nindicates that the bus voltage is too low for normal operation\nand that the fixed DC −DC converter has not started up. It\ncould also indicate a Thermal Shutdown (TSD). TheRESETB signal also indicates if communication betweenhost and NCN5110 is possible.\nThe SA VEB signal indicates correct operation. When\nSAVEB goes low, this indicates a possible issue (loss of buspower or too high temperature) which could trigger the host\ncontroller to save critical data or go to a save state. SA VEB\ngoes low immediately when VFILT goes below 14 V (dueto sudden large current usage) or after 2 ms when VBUSgoes below 20 V . RESETB goes low when VFILT goesbelow 12 V .\nRESETB− and SA VEB −pin are open −drain pins with an\ninternal pull −up resistor to V\nDDD.\nVoltage Supervisors\nNCN5110 has different voltage supervisors monitoring\nVBUS, VFILT, VDD2 and V20V . The general function of a\nvoltage supervisor is to detect when a voltage is above orbelow a certain level. The levels for the different voltages\nmonitored can be found back in T able 4 (see also Figures 4,\n5, 6 and 7).\nDepending on the voltage supervisor outputs, the device\ncan enter different states (see Analog State Diagram, p19).\n3. The 4 MHz clock signal is internally generated and will be less accurate as the crystal generated clock signal of 8 or 16 MHz .\nNCN5110\nwww. onsemi.com\n17VSW1VIN\nVSS1\nVDD1M\nVDD1\nVSW2\nVSS2\nVDD2MV\nVDD2MC\nVDD2COMPSwitch\nController\nCOMPSwitch\nControllerFrom VFILT\n1/C0087\n10/C0109FVDD1 = 3.3 V\n0.47/C0087\n10/C0109FVDD2 = 1.2 V − 20 V\nNCN5110R5R4L2L1\nP2\nN2P1\nN1\nFigure 12.

Otherwise 8 MHz or 16 MHz clock signal.\n20.Only operational if Stand −By state was not entered due to VDD2 or V20V issue.\nTemperature Monitor\nThe device produces an over −temperature warning (TW)\nand a thermal shutdown warning (TSD). Whenever thejunction temperature rises above the Thermal W arning level\n(T\nTW), the SA VEB −pin will go low to signal the issue to the\nhost controller. When the junction temperature is above TW,\nthe host controller should undertake actions to reduce the\njunction temperature and/or store critical data.\nWhen the junction temperature reaches Thermal\nShutdown (T TSD), the device will go to the Reset State and\nthe analog and digital power supply will be stopped (toprotect the device). The device will stay in the Reset State\nas long as the temperature stays above T TSD.\nIf the temperature drops below T TSD, Start−Up State will\nbe entered (see also Figure 13). At the moment VDD1 is\nback up and the OTP memory is read, Stand −By State will\nbe entered and RESETB will go high. Once the temperaturehas dropped below T\nTW and all voltages are high enough,\nNormal State will be entered. SA VEB will go high and KNX\ncommunication is again possible.\nFigure 8 gives a better view on the temperature monitor.\nNCN5110\nwww. onsemi.com\n19Analog State Diagram\nThe analog state diagram of NCN5110 is given in\nFigure 13. The status of the DC −DC converters, V20V\nregulator and KNX communication during the different(analog) states is given in Table 7.\nFigure 14 gives a detailed view on the start −up behavior\nof NCN5110. After applying the bus voltage, the filter\ncapacitor starts to charge. During this Reset State, thecurrent drawn from the bus is limited to I\ncoupler  (for details\nsee the KNX Standards). Once the voltage on the filtercapacitor reaches 10 V (typ.), the fixed DC −DC converter\n(powering VDDA) will be enabled and the device enters the\nStart−Up State. When V\nDD1 gets above 2.8 V (typ.), the\nOTP memory is read out to trim some analog parameters(OTP memory is not accessible by the user). When done, the\nStand−By State is entered and the RESETB −pin is made\nhigh. When V FILT is above V FILTH  DC2 and V20V will be\nstarted. When the VBUS −, VFILT−, VDD2− and V20V −\nmonitors are ok, the Normal State will be entered andSAVEB−pin will go high.\nFigure 15 gives a detailed view on the shut −down\nbehavior. If the KNX bus voltage drops below V\nBUSL  for\nmore than t bus_filter , the Standy −By State is entered. SA VEB\nwill go low to signal this. When VFILT drops below V FILTL ,\nDC2 and the V20V regulator will be switched off. When\nVFILT drops below 6.5 V (typ), DC1 will be switched off\nand V DD1 drops below 2.8 V (typ.) the device goes to Reset\nState (RESETB low).\nFigure 13.

For cooling optimizations, the QFN40 has an exposed thermal pad which\nhas to be soldered to the PCB ground plane. The ground plane needs thermal vias to conduct the heat to the bottom layer.\nFigure 17 gives an example of good heat transfer. The exposed thermal pad is soldered directly on the top ground layer (left\npicture of Figure 17). It‘s advised to make the top ground layer as large as possible (see arrows Figure 17). To improve the heat\ntransfer even more, the exposed thermal pad is connected to a bottom ground layer by using thermal vias (see right picture of\nFigure 17). It‘s advised to make this bottom ground layer as large as possible and with as less as possible interruptions.\nFor precise thermal cooling calculations the major thermal resistances of the device are given (T able 4). The thermal media\nto which the power of the devices has to be given are:−Static environmental air (via the case)\n−PCB board copper area (via the exposed pad)\nThe major thermal resistances of the device are the Rth from the junction to the ambient (Rth\nja) and the overall Rth from\nthe junction to exposed pad (Rth jp).
