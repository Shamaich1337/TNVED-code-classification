It features an interrupt output that notifies the system of a pushbutton or low supply event. When the system is ready, it may use the power kill input to shut off power. If the pushbutton remains pressed for more than the configurable turn-off duration, the system power is forced off.  \nThe supply input covers a wide range from 1.5V to 36V. \nThe robust pushbutton input handles wide voltage swings of ±36V and ESD strikes to ±25kV (human body model) without latchup or damage. A low 1.2µA supply current maximizes battery run time.

EN is an active high output \nto control the turn-on/off of the system power. Connect this \npin to the RUN or SHUTDOWN  pin of the voltage regulator. \nThe LTC2955 asserts EN high when the pushbutton is pressed or when ON goes high. The output high voltage follows the internal LDO output which provides sufficient margin for most SHUTDOWN  pin thresholds.\nEN: Inverted Enable Output (LTC2955-2). EN  is an active \nlow output to control the turn-on/off of the system power. It may drive a voltage regulator’s active low enable input, or it may drive the gate of a P-channel MOSFET. In the turn-off state, the LTC2955 pulls this pin to V\nIN through \nan internal 900k resistor. The LTC2955 pulls EN  to GND \nwhen the pushbutton is pressed or when ON goes high. \nExposed Pad (DFN only): Exposed pad.

Connect this pin to the \ninterrupt input of the system with a pull-up resistor to the \nsystem supply. The LTC2955 asserts the INT  pin low when \nit receives the turn-off command from the pushbutton or the ON pin. The minimum pulse width of the INT  signal is \n32ms and can be extended through the TMR pin.\nKILL: Kill Input. A low at KILL  releases the enable output \n(EN/EN). This pin can be driven by the microprocessor or it \ncan be used as a voltage monitor input. Tie to the system \npower supply or an external voltage of 1.2V~5V if unused.ON: Monitor Input. Connect this pin to an external resistive \ndivider from the monitored voltage. This allows automatic system turn-on when the monitored voltage transitions high. For the DFN part, if the SEL pin is tied high, it also allows automatic system turn-off when the monitored voltage transitions low. Tie to GND if unused.\nPB: Pushbutton Input. This is an active low input with a \n900k pull-up to an internal LDO. Connect one terminal of \nthe pushbutton to this pin and connect the other terminal of the pushbutton to GND. The pin may be left open if unused.\nPGD (DFN only):  ON Status Output. A high on this pin \nindicates that the voltage at the ON pin is above the input \nthreshold of 0.8V. This pin can be used as a system input to inform the system whether the turn-on was triggered by the ON pin or the pushbutton pin. Leave open if unused.\nSEL (DFN only):  Mode Select Input. Connect SEL to GND \nto block the ON pin falling edge from activating system \nturn-off. Connect SEL to V\nIN to allow both the ON pin rising \nand falling edges to activate system turn-on and turn-off respectively. For the TSOT package, SEL is internally tied to GND. Do not leave open.\nTMR:  Timer Pin. A capacitor to ground determines the \nadditional time (5.2 seconds/μF) beyond the default 64ms \nthat the pushbutton must be held low before immediately releasing the EN/ EN and INT  outputs. The turn-off debounce \ntime defaults to 64ms if this pin is left open. To disable the ability to force a system power-down with a pushbutton press, ground the TMR pin.\nV\nIN: Power Supply Input.

Pushbutton Turn-On Timingopera Tion\nOverview \nThe LTC2955 is a pushbutton on/off controller that man -\nages system power based on a pushbutton input ( PB pin)  \nand a voltage monitor input (ON pin). In a typical application, \nthe enable output (EN/ EN) turns on system power when \nthe pushbutton is pressed or the supply monitor detects the presence of a primary or secondary supply such as a wall adaptor or car battery.\nAfter the system is powered up, a pushbutton event as -\nserts the interrupt output ( INT) wh\n ich can be used in menu \ndriven applications to request for a system power-down. \nA power kill input ( KILL) allows a microprocessor or sys -\ntem to release the enable output immediately, effectively powe\nring down the system. System power is also forced \noff if the pushbutton remains asserted for more than the forced turn-off activation time configurable via the TMR pin.\nThe LTC2955 is also designed with a blanking time after \neach system turn on and off event. During this blanking time, the LTC2955 ignores the KILL , ON and PB  pins, \nthus ensuring that the system stays on/off for a minimum amount of time. This provides sufficient time for the voltage regulator to turn on/off and allows it to charge/discharge its output to the final voltage. It also allows the µP suf -\nficient time to perform power on/off tasks.The PG\nD output indicates the status of the ON pin to allow \nthe system to differentiate between pushbutton turn-on or supply plug-in events.\nTurn-On Sequence and KILL Blanking Time\nThe LTC2955-1 asserts the EN output high if the pushbut -\nton is pressed or the ON pin goes high. This is typically \nused t\no turn on a DC/DC converter or linear regulator.\nFigure 1 shows the turn-on sequence of the LTC2955-1 initiated by the PB  pin. When the button is pressed at time \nt\n1, a high to low transition on the PB  pin initiates the turn-\non sequence. The PB  pin must stay low continuously for \na period of 32ms (t DB(ON) ) before the LTC2955-1 asserts \nthe EN output high. Once EN goes high (t 2), an internal \n512ms blanking time (t KILL(OnBlank) ) is started. During \nthis blanking time, the LTC2955-1 ignores the KILL , ON \nand PB pins and keeps EN high for at least 512ms. This \nprovides sufficient time for the voltage regulator to turn on and charge its output to the final voltage and allows the µP enough time to perform power on tasks. The µP must pull the KILL  pin high during this 512ms blanking \ntime, or else EN will go low at the end of this time (t\n3).\ntDB(ON) tKILL(ON BLANK)PB AND KILL IGNORED PB\n2955 F01EN\n(L TC2955-1)t1 t2 t3\nLTC29559\n2955fa For more information www.linear.com/LTC2955Figure 2.ON Pin Turn-On Timing\nFigure 3. Pushbutton Turn-Off Timingopera Tion\nAt the end of this blanking time, the LTC2955-1 will check \nthat the PB  pin is high. If the PB  pin remains low, it will be \nignored until a high is detected on the pin. The next low on the PB  pin will initiate a turn-off sequence.\nFigure 2 shows a similar LTC2955-1 turn-on sequence with the ON pin going high. The timing sequence is very similar to that initiated by the pushbutton. The PGD output follows the ON pin.\nPB Pin Turn-Off Sequence\nFigure 3 shows the turn-off  sequence of the LTC2955-1 \ninitiated through the PB  pin. A turn-off sequence refers \nto the LTC2955-1 releasing the EN output. This turns off the voltage regulator.A high to low transition on PB  (t\n1) starts the turn-off \nsequence. In order to assert INT  (interrupt output) low, \nPB must stay low continuously for 32ms (t DB(OFF) ). At \nthe end of the 32ms (t 2), the INT  pin is asserted low and \nwill stay low for at least 32ms (t INT(MIN) ), even if the PB  \npin goes high during this period (t 2 to t 4). When the µP \nreceives this interrupt signal, it should start to perform its power-down functions and assert KILL  low (t\n3) once \nit is done. The LTC2955-1 will then release INT  and pull \nEN low, thus turning off the system power, as shown with dotted lines in Figure 3.\nThe user can also force the system to power-down if the \nµP fails to respond to the interrupt signal ( KILL pin remains \n16 CYCLESKILL\nTMRtDB(OFF)PB\nIGNOREDPB\nIGNOREDPB\ntEN(LOCKOUT)\ntTMR\ntINT(MIN)INT\nEN\n(L TC2955-1)\n2955 F03t1 t2t3t4 t5 t6 t7\nIGNOREDtDB(ON) tKILL(ON BLANK)ON AND KILL IGNORED ONt1 t2 t3\n2955 F02EN\n(L TC2955-1)\nPGD\nLTC295510\n2955fa For more information www.linear.com/LTC2955opera Tion\nthe PB and ON inputs are ignored. This is to allow time for \nthe voltage regulator to turn off and for its output to decay \nto 0V. This ensures that the µP has completely powered down before it is allowed to restart. After the one second lockout time, the LTC2955-1 proceeds to the next stage to wait for a turn-on command and the cycle will repeat as above. If the PB  pin remains low after the EN output \ngoes low, the LTC2955-1 will delay the start of this lockout time until the PB  pin goes high.\nIf the PB  pin goes high when the external timer is still \ncounting, as shown in Figure 4, the turn-off sequence will be aborted. The INT  pin is forced high immediately and \nthe EN pin remains high.high). This can be done by holding the pushbutton down for a long period (> t\nDB(OFF)  + tINT(MIN)  + tTMR) as shown \nwith the solid lines in Figure 3. If the PB pin remains low at \nthe end of the 32ms minimum INT  pulse width (t INT(MIN) ), \nthe external timer will start counting (t 4).\nThe capacitance at the TMR pin determines the duration of this timer and it will count for 16 cycles (t\nTMR). If the \nPB pin remains low at the end of the 16 cycles (t 5), the \nLTC2955-1 will force the EN pin low and the INT  pin high. \nSee Applications Information for adjusting t TMR.\nAfter the EN output goes low and the PB  pin goes high, \nthe LTC2955-1 starts the one second lockout time (t\nEN(LOCKOUT) ). During this lockout time (t 6 to t7 in Figure 3)  \nFigure 4.

The timing sequence is slightly different from that by the pushbutton as there is no de -\nbounce time (t\nDB(OFF) ) before the INT  pin pulls low. The \nON pin falling edge  can start the turn-off sequence only if the following two conditions are met: (1) The preceding turn-on sequence was initiated by the ON pin rising edge, and (2) The SEL pin must be tied high (>0.8V). For TS8 package, the ON pin falling edge is ignored.\nIn Figure 5, a high to low transition at ON (t\n1) starts the \nturn-off sequence. The interrupt output ( INT) is asserted \nimmediately when the ON pin goes low. Unlike the PB  \npin turn-off sequence, there is no 32ms debounce time \n(tDB(FF) ) for the ON pin going low. This allows the system \nto initiate a shutdown as soon as the monitored supply is removed and allows the µP  the maximum amount of time to perform power-down functions. The INT  pin will stay \nlow for at least 32ms (t\nINT(MIN) ). When the µP receives \nthis interrupt signal, it should start to perform its power-down functions and assert the KILL  input low (t\n2) once it \nis done. The LTC2955-1 will then release the EN and INT  \noutputs, thus turning off the system power, as shown with dotted lines in Figure 5.\nIf the µP fails to respond ( KILL pin remains high, as shown \nwith solid line in Figure 5) and the ON pin remains low 32ms \nafter INT goes low, the external timer will start counting \nfor 16 cycles (t\nTMR, t3 to t 4). If the ON pin remains low \nat the end of the 16 cycles (t 4), the LTC2955-1 will force \nthe EN pin low and the INT pin high. See Applications \nInformation for adjusting t TMR. \nAfter the EN output goes low, the LTC2955-1 starts the  \none second lockout time (t EN(LOCKOUT) ). During this lockout \ntime (t 4 to t 5), the PB  and ON inputs are ignored.opera Tion\nFigure 5.

Once EN \ngoes high (t 3), the ON input is ignored, so a falling edge \nat the ON pin (t 4) will not initiate a turn-off sequence even \nif the SEL pin is high. This allows the system to remain powered up if it is plugged in and out of a secondary power source while the system is already turned on.  \nIf the turn-on sequence is initiated by the ON pin, both \nthe pushbutton and the ON pin falling edge can initiate the turn-off sequence. For the TS8 package, ON pin falling edge is always ignored regardless of which pins initiate the turn-on.The PB pin has priority over the ON pin, so if the PB  pin \ngoes low and ON pin goes high at the same time, the LTC2955-1 will monitor the PB  pin for the 32ms debounce \ntime and ignore the ON pin unless the PB  pin bounces \nduring the 32ms.\nON Pin Initial Turn-On \nIf the LTC2955-1 powers up with the ON pin already high, \nthe EN pin will go high after a power-up delay of about one second. Subsequently, if the pushbutton is pressed to force EN low, the LTC2955-1 will not initiate another turn-on even if the ON pin remains high. The LTC2955-1 needs a rising edge at the ON pin or a falling edge on the PB pin to initiate the subsequent turn-on. \nFigure 6.

At \ntime t 3, the pushbutton is pressed to activate turn-off \nwhile the ON pin remains high. The LTC2955-1 will wait for a rising edge at the ON pin or a low at the PB  pin to \nactivate the next turn-on. As shown at time t\n4, after the  \none second lockout time, the EN stays low with ON high. At time t\n5, only the rising edge of the ON pin or a PB event \nwill trigger the next turn-on again.\nL TC2955-1, L TC2955-2 Versions \nThe LTC2955-1 and LTC2955-2 differ only by the polarity \nof the high voltage (36V absolute maximum) enable pin. The LTC2955-1 EN pin is a high true output designed to drive the SHUTDOWN  pin of most voltage regulators. In \nturn-on mode, this pin is pulled high by a pull-up current of 2µA powered by an internal LDO, which gives a high level output voltage (V\nOH) of typically 4.3V. In turn-off mode, \nthis pin is pulled low by an internal N-channel MOSFET. If a higher V\nOH or higher pull-up current is required, connect \nthe EN pin to an external source through a pull-up resistor.   \nThe LTC2955-2 EN  pin is a low true enable output designed \nto drive the gate of an external P-channel MOSFET. In \nturn-on mode, the EN  pin is pulled low by an internal \nN-channel MOSFET. In turn-off mode, this pin is pulled high to V\nIN through an internal 900k resistor.  An external \npull-up resistor can be connected between this pin and V\nIN to increase the pull-up current.\nFigure 7.

As shown by the solid lines in Figure 3 and Figure 5, when the µP fails to bring the KILL  pin low after the interrupt signal \nis asserted, the user can force a turn-off by holding down the pushbutton. The length of time that PB  must be held \nlow is given by a fixed 64ms delay (t\nDB(OFF)  + tINT(MIN) ) \nplus an adjustable power-down timer delay (t TMR). The \nadjustable delay is set by placing an optional external capacitor on the TMR pin. Use the following equation to calculate the capacitance for the desired delay. C\nTMR is \nthe external capacitor at the TMR pin:\n CTMR = 0.19 • t TMR [µF/sec]\nAs an example, if the required turn-off debounce time is one second:\n tTMR = (1000ms – 64ms)\n CTMR = 0.19 • 0.936\nRequired C TMR is 0.178µF\nThe ON pin turn-off debounce time is 32ms less than the PB pin debounce time since there is no t\nDB(OFF) . If the \nTMR pin is left open, the turn-off debounce time defaults to 64ms for the PB  pin and 32ms for the ON pin.Voltage Monitoring with KILL Input\nThe KILL pin can also be used as a voltage monitor input. \nFigure 8 shows an application where the KILL  pin has a dual \nfunction. It is driven by a low leakage open drain output \nof the µP. It is also connected to a resistive divider that monitors battery voltage (V\nIN). When the battery voltage \nfalls below the set value, the voltage at the KILL  pin falls \nbelow 0.8V and the EN pin is quickly pulled low. Note that the resistor values should be as large as possible, but small enough to keep leakage currents from tripping the 0.8V KILL  comparator. \nOperation Without µP\nIf there is no circuitry available to drive the KILL  pin, \nthis pin can be connected to a voltage regulator output \nthrough a resistive divider or RC network as shown in Figure 9. The KILL  pin acts as a voltage monitor pin that \nshuts down the regulator when its output voltage drops below a certain level. \nThe minimum pulse width needed to trigger KILL  is 30µs. \nIf there are glitches on the resistor pull-up voltage that \nare wider than 30µs and transition below 0.8V, then an appropriate bypass capacitor should be connected to the KILL pin. \nFigure 8.

This allows a user to connect/disconnect a power supply (or battery) to its load by toggling the PB  pin. Figure 10  \nshows the LTC2955-2 controlling a two cell Li-Ion battery appli\ncation. The KILL  pin is connected to the output of the \nexternal MOSFET through a resistive divider. The KILL  pin \nserves as a voltage monitor. When V OUT drops below 6V, \nthe EN pin is pulled high (to V IN) after 15µs later. R9 slows \ndown the turning on of M1 so as to limit the inrush current when M1 turns on to charge up the capacitor at V\nOUT. R5 \nhelps to speed up the turning off of M1 and also to keep M1 off when the input voltage rise time is fast.\nPB Pin in a Noisy Environment\nThe rugged PB  pin is designed to operate in noisy environ -\nments. Transients below ground and above V\nIN (–36V < \nVIN < 36V) will not damage the rugged PB  pin. Additionally, \nthe PB pin can withstand ESD HBM strikes of up to ±25kV. \nHowever, if the pushbutton switch is located physically far \nfrom the LTC2955 PB  pin, the parasitic capacitance and \nparasitic series inductance of the connecting cable or PCB trace can create problems. The parasitic capacitance can couple external noise onto the PB  input; placing a 0.1µF capacitor at the pin lessens the impact of this coupling. The parasitic series inductance may cause unpredictable ringing at the PB  pin; placing a 5.1k resistor from the PB  \npin to the pushbutton switch reduces this ringing. Figure 11  \nshows an example of this RC network at the PB  pin. \nExternal Pull-Up Resistor on PB\n Pin\nAn internal 900k pull-up resistor on the PB  pin makes an \nexternal pull-up resistor unnecessary. Leakage current on the PB board trace, however, will affect the open circuit \nvoltage on the PB  pin. If the leakage is too large (>1µA), \nthe PB voltage may fall close to the threshold window.

The LTC2955’s V IN pin \nis internally clamped to one diode voltage below ground. \nIn battery operated applications where a battery could be inserted improperly, this resistor will limit the current and allow internal clamping to protect the pin.Figure 12. External Pull-Up Resistor on PB Pin\nFigure 13. Enhancing V IN RuggednessFigure 14. Using a Slide Switch to Prevent Accidental  \nTurn-On/Off\nFigure 15. Using a Slide or Toggle Switch to Turn-On/OffAdding a 10nF capacitor in addition to the 1k resistor can \nprotect against high voltage input transients that would exceed the 40V Absolute Maximum Voltage rating of the V\nIN pin. These could occur during hot-plugging into a \nbattery or AC adapter. This can also protect against tran -\nsients that may appear on the PCB ground during large ESD st \nrikes at the PB  pin.\nThe maximum operating current of the LTC2955 is less than 3µA, creating an insignificant voltage drop across the resistor. Using a capacitor value of 10nF provides sufficient filtering for most applications and larger values can actually diminish its effectiveness.\nApplications with Slide Switch\nIn some applications, to prevent accidental toggling of the \nsystem power, a slide switch is preferred over a pushbut -\nton. Figure 14 shows a slide switch added in series with the p u\nshbutton. The user can slide the switch open to \nactivate the HOLD/LOCK function, where the pushbutton is disabled. Figure 15 shows a slide switch connected to the LTC2955 ON pin resistive divider.

The EN pin is designed to be able to sink at least 1mA of current during turn-off, so this external pull-up resistor value must be selected to source less than 1mA with EN at 0V. \nThe LTC2955-1 EN pin can also be connected to switching \nregulators with a RUN/SS pin. RUN/SS has a dual func -\ntion of a SHUTDOWN  thre\n shold and soft-start, with an \ninternal soft-start pull-up current and an external soft-start capacitor. The LTC2955 EN pin pull-up current of 2µA will add to the soft-start pull-up current of the regulator. The and the device turns on. If the user slides the switch to the OFF position, the ON pin voltage drops to 0V and the LTC2955 activates a turn-off since the SEL pin is high (DFN package only).\nInterface with Switching Regulators\nThe LTC2955-1 EN pin can be connected directly to most \nswitching regulator SHUTDOWN  inputs. The EN pin high \nlevel output voltage (V\nEN(VOH) ) is typically 4.3V with  \nVIN >5V, and V EN(VOH)  = V IN – 0.5V if V IN <5V. With a \nminimum V IN of 1.5V, V EN(VOH)  is still higher than most \nSHUTDOWN  thresholds (usually <1.2V). Figure 16 shows \none such application. The regulator is a boost converter with a SHUTDOWN  high threshold of 0.88V (maximum). \nFigure 16. 2-Cell with 3.3V OutputFigure 17.

Position the bypass capacitor close \nto the LTC2955 on the same side of the PCB and keep the traces short. For the DFN package, a PCB via should be placed near the LTC2955 to connect the PB  pin (Pin 5)  \nto the pushbutton. This allows an unbroken trace to be place\nd between the V IN pin and the bypass capacitor. \nPlacing the bypass capacitor close to the LTC2955 gives the optimum protection against PB  pin ESD transients.\n2955 F18GNDCVINLTC2955DDB\n11\n68\n7910\n542\n31\nVIN\nVIN1\n23487\n65L TC2955TS8\nGNDCVIN\nLTC295518\n2955fa For more information www.linear.com/LTC2955Typical applica Tions\nLow Voltage Pushbutton Controller Enables Charge Pump Automatic Power-Up with Pushbutton On/Off\nPowerPath Control with Immediate KILLL TC3204-3.3\nVOUT\nC+\nC–VIN\nGND\nPBINT\nKILLVIN\nL TC2955TS8-1\n2955 TA02µP1M\nGND ON TMREN2.2µF3.3V\nSHDN2.2µF1.8VL T1763-5\nVOUT VIN\nPBINT\nKILLPGD\nTMRVIN\nONL TC2955DDB-1\n2955 TA03µP1M\nGND SELEN\n*OPTIONAL RC NETWORK RECOMMENDED TO IMPROVE NOISE IMMUNITYSHDN1µF12V\n0.1µF*5.1k*\nL T3009\nVOUT VIN\nPBKILL\nINTVIN\nL TC2955TS8-2\n2955 TA041M\nGND ON TMREN3.3V\n100kSHDN\n0.1µF12V\nLTC295519\n2955fa For more information www.linear.com/LTC2955package Descrip Tion\nPlease refer to http://www.linear.com/product/LTC2955#packaging for the most recent package drawings.\n2.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
