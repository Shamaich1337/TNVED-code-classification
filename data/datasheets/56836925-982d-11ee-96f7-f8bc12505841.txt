True Shutdown disconnects the output from the \ninput with no forward or reverse current. The output volt -\nage is selectable using a single standard 1% resistor. The \n225mA (MAX17220/MAX17221), 500mA (MAX17222/\nMAX17223), and 1A (MAX17224/MAX17225) peak induc -\ntor current limits allow flexibility when choosing inductors. \nThe MAX17220/MAX17222/MAX17224 versions have \npost-startup enable transient protection (ETP), allowing \nthe output to remain regulated for input voltages down \nto 400mV, depending on load current.

True Shutdown disconnects the input from the output, saving precious battery life. Every detail of the \nMAX17220–MAX17225 was carefully chosen to allow for the lowest power and smallest solution size. Such details as \nswitching frequencies up to 2.5MHz, tiny package options, a single-output setting resistor, 300ns fixed turn-on time, as \nwell as three current limit options, allow the user to minimize the total solution size. \nSupply Current \nTrue Shutdown Current \nThe total system shutdown current (I SD_TOTAL_SYSTEM ) is made up of the MAX17220–MAX17225 total shutdown \ncurrent (I SD_TOTAL ) and the current through an external pullup resistor, as shown in Figure 1  ISD_TOTAL  is listed in the \nElectrical Characteristics  table and is typically 0.5nA. It is important to note that I SD_TOTAL  includes LX and IN leakage \ncurrents. (See the Shutdown Supply Current vs. Temperature graph in the Typical Operating Characteristics  section.) \nISD_TOTAL_SYSTEM  current can be calculated using the formula below. For example, for the MAX17220–MAX17225 \nwith EN connected to an open-drain GPIO of a microcontroller, a V IN = 1.5V, V OUT  = 3V, and a 33MΩ pullup resistor, \nISD_TOTAL_SYSTEM  current is 45.9nA. \nISD_TOTAL_SYSTEM =ISD_TOTAL +VIN\nRPULLUP =0.5nA+1.5\n33MΩ=45.9nA \n(Figure 1 ) \nFigure 2  shows a typical connection of the MAX17221/MAX17223/MAX17225 to a push-pull microcontroller GPIO. \nISD_TOTAL_SYSTEM  current can be calculated using the formula below. For example, a MAX17221/MAX17223/\nMAX17225 with EN connected to a push-pull microcontroller GPIO, V IN = 1.5V, and V OUT  = 3V, I SD_TOTAL_SYSTEM \ncurrent is 0.5nA. \nISD_TOTAL_SYSTEM =ISD_TOTAL =0.5nA \n(Figure 2 , Figure 3 ) \nFigure 3  shows a typical connection of the MAX17220/MAX17222/MAX17224 with a pushbutton switch to minimize \nthe ISD_TOTAL_SYSTEM  current.

For example, \na MAX17220/MAX17222/MAX17224 with EN connected as shown in Figure 3 , with V IN = 1.5V and V OUT  = 3V, the \nISD_TOTAL_SYSTEM  current is 0.5nA. \nINSEL\nGNDLXIN                                                        OUT\nMAX17220–\nMAX17225\nOUTENRPULLUP33MΩ \nµC\nOPEN-DRAIN \nGPIO\nFigure 1.

The MAX17220/MAX17222/MAX17224 Total System Shutdown Current Will Only Be Leakage if Able to Use Pushbutton as \nShown. \nEnable Transient Protection (ETP) Current \nThe MAX17220/MAX17222/MAX17224 have internal circuitry that helps protect against accidental shutdown by \ntransients on the EN pin. Once the part is started up, these parts allow the voltage at IN to drop as low as 400mV while still \nkeeping the part enabled, depending on the load current. This feature comes at the cost of slightly higher supply current \nthat is dependent on the pullup resistor resistance. The extra supply current for this protection option can be calculated \nby the equation below. For example, for the MAX17220/MAX17222/MAX17224 used in the Figure 1  connection, a V IN = \n1.5V, V OUT  = 3V, a 33MΩ pullup resistor and an 85% efficiency, the IQ_ETP is expected to be 61.3nA. \nIQ_ETP =(VOUT−VIN)\n(RPULLUP+100K)×(1\nη×VOUT\nVIN−1)\n \n(Figure 1 ) \nIQ_ETP =(3V−1.5V)\n(33M+100K)×(1\n0.85×3V\n1.5−1)=61.3nA \n(Figure 1 ) \nUse the efficiency η from the flat portion of the efficiency typical operating curves while the device is in ultra-low-\npower mode (ULPM). See the PFM Control Scheme  section for more info on ULPM. Do not use the efficiency for your \nactual load current. If you are using the versions of the part without enable input transient protection (using MAX17221/\nMAX17223/MAX17225), or if you are using any part version and the electrical path from the EN pin is opened after \nstartup, then there is no IQ_ETP current and it will be zero. \nIQ_ETP = N/A = 0 \n(Figure 2 ) MAX17220–MAX17225 400mV to 5.5V Input, nanoPower Synchronous\nBoost Converters with True Shutdown\nwww.analog.com Analog Devices  |  10\nIQ_ETP=(VOUT)\n(RPULLUP+100K)×(1η×VOUTVIN) \n(Figure 3 ) \nIQ_ETP =(3V)\n(33M+100K)×(1\n0.85×3V\n1.5V)=213.2nA \n(Figure 3 ) \nQuiescent Current \nThe MAX17221–MAX17225 has ultra-low quiescent current and was designed to operate at low input voltages by \nbootstrapping itself from its output by drawing current from the output. Use the equation below to calculate the total \nsystem quiescent current IQ_TOTAL_SYSTEM using the efficiency η from the flat portion of the efficiency graph in the \nTypical Operating Characteristics  section while the device is in ULPM. See the PFM control scheme section for more info \non ULPM. Do not use the efficiency for your actual load current. To calculate the IQ_ETP for the MAX17220/MAX17222/\nMAX17224, see the Enable Transient Protection (ETP) Current  section. If you are using the versions of the part without \nenable input transient protection (using the MAX17221/MAX17223/MAX17225) or if you are using any part version and \nthe electrical path from the EN pin is opened after startup, then the IQ_ETP current will be zero. For example, for the \nMAX17221/MAX17223/MAX17225, V IN = 1.5V, V OUT  = 3V, and an 85% efficiency, the IQ_TOTAL_SYSTEM is 706.4nA. \nIQ_TOTAL_SYSTEM =IQ_IN_TOTAL +IQ_OUT\nη×(VIN\nVOUT)\n \n(MAX17221/3/5) \nIQ_TOTAL_SYSTEM =0.5nA+300nA\n0.85×(1.5V\n3V)=706.4nA\n \n(MAX17221/3/5) \nIQ_TOTAL_SYSTEM =IQ_IN_TOTAL +IQ_OUT\nη×(VIN\nVOUT)+IQ_ETP\n \n(MAX17220/2/4) \n(MAX17220/2/4) \nIQ_TOTAL_SYSTEM =0.5nA+300nA\n0.85×(1.5V\n3V)+61.3nA=767.7nA\n \n(MAX17220/2/4) \nPFM Control Scheme \nThe MAX17221–MAX17225 utilizes a fixed on-time, current-limited, pulse-frequency-modulation (PFM) control scheme \nthat allows ultra-low quiescent current and high efficiency over a wide output current range. The inductor current \nis limited by the 0.225A/0.5A/1A N-channel current limit or by the 300ns switch maximum on-time. During each on \ncycle, either the maximum on-time or the maximum current limit is reached before the off-time of the cycle begins. \nThe MAX17221–MAX17225 PFM control scheme allows for both continuous conduction mode (CCM) or discontinuous \nconduction mode (DCM). When the error comparator senses that the output has fallen below the regulation threshold, \nanother cycle begins. See the MAX17221–MAX17225 simplified Functional Diagram . \nThe MAX17221–MAX17225 automatically switches between the ULPM, low-power mode (LPM) and high-power mode \n(HPM), depending on the load current. Figure 4  and Figure 5  show typical waveforms while in each mode. The output \nvoltage, by design, is biased 2.5% higher while in ULPM so that it can more easily weather a future large load transient. \nULPM is used when the system is in standby or an ultra-low-power state. LPM and HPM are useful for sensitive sensor \nmeasurements or during wireless communications for medium output currents and large output currents respectively. The \nuser can calculate the value of the load current where ULPM transitions to LPM using the equation below.

While in regulation, if V IN steps abruptly above V OUT  for \nmore than 1V (typ), the device will reset. Output voltage droop in this case will be a function of the load current, output \ncapacitance, and time required for soft-start to complete, which is 1.5ms (typ). \nDesign Procedure \nOutput Voltage Selection \nThe MAX17221–MAX17225 has a unique single-resistor output selection method known as R SEL, as shown in Figure \n6. At startup, the MAX17221–MAX17225 uses up to 200μA only during the select resistor detection time, typically for \n600μs, to read the R SEL value. R SEL has many benefits, which include lower cost and smaller size, since only one \nresistor is needed versus the two resistors needed in typical feedback connections. Another benefit is that R SEL allows \nour customers to stock just one part in their inventory system and use it in multiple projects with different output voltages \njust by changing a single standard 1% resistor. Lastly, R SEL eliminates wasting current continuously through feedback \nresistors for ultra-low-power battery-operated products. Select the R SEL resistor value by choosing the desired output \nvoltage in the RSEL Selection Table . \nINSEL\nGNDLXIN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \nGNDOUT\nMAX1722XMAX1722X\nOUTENEN\nRSEL\nFigure 6.

Smaller inductance values \ntypically allow for the smallest physical size, and larger inductance values allow for more output current assuming CCM is \nachieved. Most applications are expected to use 2.2μH, as shown in the example circuits. For low input voltages, 1μH will \nwork best. If one of the example application circuits does not provide enough output current, use the equations below to \ncalculate a larger inductance value that meets the output current requirements, assuming it is possible to achieve. For the \nequations below, choose an I IN between 0.9 x I LIM and half I LIM. It is not recommended to use an inductor value smaller \nthan 1μH or larger than 4.7μH. See the Typical Operating Characteristics  section for choosing the value of efficiency η \nusing the closest conditions for your application. An example calculation has been provided for the MAX17222 that has \nILIM = 500mA, V IN (min) = 1.8V, V OUT  = 3V, and a desired I OUT  of 205mA, which is beyond one of the 2.2μH example \ncircuits. The result shows that the inductor value can be changed to 3.3μH to achieve a little more output current. \nIIN=VOUT×IOUT\nη×VIN=3V×205mA\n0.85×1.8V=402mA\n \nILIM\n2<IIN<0.9×ILIM \nΔI = (I LIM - IIN)× 2 = (500mA - 402mA)× 2 = 196mA \nLMIN=VIN×tON(MAX)\nΔl=1.8V×300ns\n196mA=2.76μH \n= > 3.3µH closest standard value MAX17220–MAX17225 400mV to 5.5V Input, nanoPower Synchronous\nBoost Converters with True Shutdown\nwww.analog.com Analog Devices  |  14\nCapacitor Selection \nInput capacitors reduce current peaks from the battery and increase efficiency. For the input capacitor, choose a ceramic \ncapacitor because they have the lowest equivalent series resistance (ESR), smallest size, and lowest cost. Choose an \nacceptable dielectric such as X5R or X7R. Other capacitor types can be used as well but will have larger ESR. The \nbiggest downside of ceramic capacitors is their capacitance drop with higher DC bias and, because of this, at minimum \na standard 10μF ceramic capacitor is recommended at the input for most applications. The minimum recommended \ncapacitance (not capacitor) at the input is 2μF for most applications. For applications that use batteries that have a \nhigh source impedance greater than 1Ω, more capacitance may be needed. A good starting point is to use the same \ncapacitance value at the input as for the output. \nThe minimum output capacitance that ensures stability is 2μF. At minimum, a standard 10μF X5R (or X7R) ceramic \ncapacitor is recommended for most applications. Due to DC bias effects, the actual capacitance can be 80% lower \nthan the nominal capacitor value. The output ripple can be calculated with the following equation. For example, for the \nMAX17220 and MAX17222–MAX17225 with V IN = 1.5V, V OUT  = 3V, an effective capacitance of 5μF, and a capacitor \nESR of 4mΩ, the expected ripple is 7mV. \nV_RIPPLE =IL_PEAK ×ESR_COUT  \n+1\n2IL_PEAK ×tOFF×1\nCOUT(effective ) \nWhere, \nIL_PEAK =VIN\nL×tON=1.5V\n2.2μH×300ns=204mA \ntOFF=tON[VIN\nVOUT−VIN]=300ns×[1.5V\n3V−1.5V]=300ns\n \nCOUT  (effective) = 5μF, ESR_COUT for Murata GRM155R61A106ME44 is 4mΩ from 200kHz to 2MHz. \nV_RIPPLE =204mA×4mΩ+1\n2×204mA×300ns×1\n5μF=7mV \nPCB Layout Guidelines \nCareful PC board layout is especially important in nanocurrent DC-DC converters. In general, minimize trace lengths to \nreduce parasitic capacitance, parasitic resistance, and radiated noise. Remember that every square of 1oz copper will \nresult in 0.5mΩ of parasitic resistance. The connection from the bottom of the output capacitor and the ground pin of the \ndevice must be extremely short, as should be that of the input capacitor. Keep the main power path from IN, LX, OUT, \nand GND as tight and short as possible. Minimize the surface area used for LX since this is the noisiest node. Lastly, the \ntrace used for R SEL should not be too long nor produce a capacitance of more than a few picofarads.
