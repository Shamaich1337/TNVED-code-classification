The A port is \ndesigned to track V CCA. VCCA accepts any supply \nvoltage from 1.2 V to 3.6 V. The B port is designed \nto track V CCB. VCCB accepts any supply voltage from \n1.65 V to 5.5 V. This allows for universal low-voltage \nbidirectional translation between any of the 1.2-V, 1.5-\nV, 1.8-V, 2.5-V, 3.3-V, and 5-V voltage nodes. V CCA \nshould not exceed V CCB.\nWhen the output-enable (OE) input is low, all outputs \nare placed in the high-impedance state.\nThe TXB0108 is designed so that the OE input circuit \nis supplied by V CCA.\nThis device is fully specified for partial-power-down \napplications using I off. The I off circuitry disables \nthe outputs, preventing damaging current backflow \nthrough the device when it is powered down.\nTo ensure the high-impedance state during power-up \nor power-down, OE should be tied to GND through a \npulldown resistor; the minimum value of the resistor \nis determined by the current-sourcing capability of the \ndriver.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTXB0108DQS SON (20) 2.00 mm x 4.00 mm\nTXB0108ZXYBGA MICROSTAR \nJUNIOR (20)2.50 mm x 3.00 mm\nTXB0108PW TSSOP (20) 6.50 mm x 4.40 mm\nTXB0108RGY VQFN (20) 4.50 mm x 3.50 mm\nTXB0108YZP DSGBA (20) 1.90 mm x 2.40 mm\nTXB0108NME nFBGA (20) 2.50 mm x 3.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the datasheet.\nProcessor PeripheralVCCA VCCB\nTypical Application Block Diagram for TXB0108TXB0108\nSCES643H  – NOVEMBER 2006 – REVISED AUGUST 2020\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The A port is able to accept I/O voltages ranging from 1.2 V to 3.6 V, while the B port can accept \nI/O voltages from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The device is a buffered architecture with edge-rate accelerators (one-shots) \nto improve the overall data rate. This device can only translate push-pull CMOS logic outputs. If for open-drain \nsignal translation, please refer to TI TXS products.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nwww.ti.comTXB0108\nSCES643H – NOVEMBER 2006 – REVISED AUGUST 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TXB0108\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Architecture\nThe TXB0108 architecture (see Figure 8-1 ) does not require a direction-control signal to control the direction of \ndata flow from A to B or from B to A. In a dc state, the output drivers of the TXB0108 can maintain a high or low, \nbut are designed to be weak so that they can be overdriven by an external driver when data on the bus starts \nflowing the opposite direction. The output one-shots detect rising or falling edges on the A or B ports. During \na rising edge, the one-shot turns on the PMOS transistors (T1, T3) for a short duration, which speeds up the \nlow-to-high transition. Similarly, during a falling edge, the one-shot turns on the NMOS transistors (T2, T4) for a \nshort duration, which speeds up the high-to-low transition. The typical output impedance during output transition \nis 70 Ω at VCCO = 1.2 V to 1.8 V, 50 Ω at VCCO = 1.8 V to 3.3 V and 40 Ω at VCCO = 3.3 V to 5 V.\n4k\n4kA BVCCA VCCB\nOne\nShotOne\nShot\nOne\nShot\nOne\nShotT1\nT2\nT3\nT4\nFigure 8-1.

PCB signal trace-lengths should be kept short enough \nsuch that the round-trip delay of any reflection is less than the one-shot duration. This improves signal integrity \nby ensuring that any reflection sees a low impedance at the driver. The O.S. circuits have been designed to \nstay on for approximately 10 ns. The maximum capacitance of the lumped load that can be driven also depends \ndirectly on the one-shot duration. With very heavy capacitive loads, the one-shot can time-out before the signal \nis driven fully to the positive rail. The O.S. duration has been set to best optimize trade-offs between dynamic \nICC, load driving capability, and maximum bit-rate considerations. Both PCB trace length and connectors add \nto the capacitance that the TXB0108 output sees, so it is recommended that this lumped-load capacitance be \nconsidered to avoid O.S. re-triggering, bus contention, output signal oscillations, or other adverse system-level \naffects.\n8.3.4 Enable and Disable\nThe TXB0108 has an OE input that is used to disable the device by setting OE = low, which places all I/Os in the \nhigh-impedance (Hi-Z) state. The disable time (tdis) indicates the delay between when OE goes low and when \nthe outputs actually get disabled (Hi-Z). The enable time (ten) indicates the amount of time the user must allow \nfor the one-shot circuitry to become operational after the OE is high.\n8.3.5 Pullup or Pulldown Resistors on I/O Lines\nThe TXB0108 is designed to drive capacitive loads of up to 70 pF. The output drivers of the TXB0108 have low \ndc drive strength. If pullup or pulldown resistors are connected externally to the data I/Os, their values must be \nkept higher than 50 k Ω to ensure that they do not contend with the output drivers of the TXB0108. For the same \nreason, the TXB0108 should not be used in applications such as I2C or 1-Wire where an open-drain driver is \nconnected on the bidirectional data I/O. For these applications, use a device from the TI TXS01xx series of level \ntranslators.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe TXB0108 device has two functional modes, enabled and disabled. To disable the device, set the OE input \nlow, which places all I/Os in a high impedance state. Setting the OE input high will enable the device.www.ti.comTXB0108\nSCES643H – NOVEMBER 2006 – REVISED AUGUST 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TXB0108\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe TXB0108 can be used in level-translation applications for interfacing devices or systems operating at \ndifferent interface voltages with one another. It can only translate push-pull CMOS logic outputs. If for open-\ndrain signal translation, please refer to TI TXS010X products. Any external pulldown or pullup resistors are \nrecommended to be larger than 50kΩ.\n9.2 Typical Application\nFigure 9-1. Typical Operating Circuit\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nFor this design example, use the parameters listed in Table 9-1 . Make sure the VCCA ≤VCCB.\nTable 9-1. Design Parameters\nDESIGN PARAMETER EXAMPLE VALUE\nInput voltage range 1.2 V to 3.6 V\nOutput voltage range 1.65 V to 5.5 V\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nTo begin the design process, determine the following:\n• Input voltage range\n- Use the supply voltage of the device that is driving the TXB0108 device to determine the input voltage range. \nFor a valid logic high the value must exceed the VIH of the input port. For a valid logic low, the value must be \nless than the VIL of the input port.\n• Output voltage range\n- Use the supply voltage of the device that the TXB0108 device is driving to determine the output voltage range.TXB0108\nSCES643H – NOVEMBER 2006 – REVISED AUGUST 2020 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TXB0108\n- Do not recommend having the external pullup or pulldown resistors. If mandatory, it is recommended the value \nshould be larger than 50 kΩ.\n• An external pulldown or pullup resistor decreases the output V OH and V OL. Use the below equations to draft \nestimate the V OH and V OL as a result of an external pulldown and pullup resistor.\nVOH = V CCx × R PD / (R PD + 4.5 kΩ)\nVOL = V CCx × 4.5kΩ / (R PU + 4.5 kΩ)\nWhere:\n• VCCx is the output port supply voltage on either VCCA or VCCB\n• RPD is the value of the external pull down resistor\n• RPU is the value of the external pull up resistor\n• 4.5 k Ω is the counting the variation of the serial resistor 4 k Ω in the I/O line. Refer to the Effects of external \npullup and pulldown resistors on TXB  application note\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 9-2.

During power-up sequencing, V CCA ≥ VCCB does not \ndamage the device, so any power supply can be ramped up first. The TXB0108 has circuitry that disables all \noutput ports when either VCC is switched off (V CCA/B  = 0 V).\nThe output-enable (OE) input circuit is designed so that it is supplied by V CCA and when the (OE) input is low, \nall outputs are placed in the high-impedance state. To ensure the high-impedance state of the outputs during \npower-up or power-down, the OE input pin must be tied to GND through a pulldown resistor and must not be \nenabled until V CCA and V CCB are fully ramped and stable. The minimum value of the pulldown resistor to ground \nis determined by the current-sourcing capability of the driver.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nTo ensure reliability of the device, the following common printed-circuit board layout guidelines is recommended.\n•Bypass capacitors should be used on power supplies and should be placed as close as possible to the V CCA, \nVCCB pin and GND pin.\n•Short trace lengths should be used to avoid excessive loading.\n•PCB signal trace-lengths must be kept short enough so that the round-trip delay of any reflection is less than \nthe one-shot duration, approximately 10 ns, ensuring that any reflection encounters low impedance at the \nsource driver.\n11.2 Layout Example\nTXB0108\nSCES643H – NOVEMBER 2006 – REVISED AUGUST 2020 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TXB0108\n12 Device and Documentation Support\n12.1 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
