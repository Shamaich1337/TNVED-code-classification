All rights reserved.\nSignal Descriptions\nTable 4: Signal Descriptions\nSymbol Type Description\nCLK Input Clock: Each cycle of the clock directs a transfer on the command line and on the data line(s). The\nfrequency can vary between the minimum and the maximum clock frequency.\nRST_n Input Reset: The RST_n signal is used by the host for resetting the device, moving the device to the pre-\nidle state. By default, the RST_n signal is temporarily disabled in the device. The host must set ECSD\nregister byte 162, bits[1:0] to 0x1 to enable this functionality before the host can use it.\nCMD I/O Command: This signal is a bidirectional command channel used for command and response trans-\nfers. The CMD signal has two bus modes: open-drain mode and push-pull mode. Commands are\nsent from the MMC host to the device, and responses are sent from the device to the host.\nDAT[7:0] I/O Data I/O: These are bidirectional data signals. The DAT signals operate in push-pull mode. By de-\nfault, after power-on or assertion of the RST_n signal, only DAT0 is used for data transfer. The\nMMC controller can configure a wider data bus for data transfer either using DAT[3:0] (4-bit mode)\nor DAT[7:0] (8-bit mode). The device includes internal pull-up resistors for data lines DAT[7:1]. Im-\nmediately after entering the 4-bit mode, the device disconnects the internal pull-up resistors on\nthe DAT[3:1] lines. Upon entering the 8-bit mode, the device disconnects the internal pull-ups on\nthe DAT[7:1] lines.\nDS Output Data strobe: Generated by the device and used for data output and CRC status response output in\nHS400 mode. The frequency of this signal follows the frequency of CLK. For data output, each cycle\nof this signal directs two bits transfer (2x) on the data, one bit for the positive edge and the other\nbit for the negative edge. For CRC status response output, the CRC status is latched on the positive\nedge only, and is "Don\'t Care" on the negative edge.\nVCC Supply VCC: NAND interface (I/F) I/O and NAND Flash power supply.\nVCCQ Supply VCCQ: e.MMC controller core and e.MMC I/F I/O power supply.\nVSS1Supply VSS: NAND I/F I/O and NAND Flash ground connection.\nVSSQ1Supply VSSQ: e.MMC controller core and e.MMC I/F ground connection.\nVDDIM  Internal voltage node. Do not tie to supply voltage or ground.\nNC – No connect: No internal connection is present.\nRFU – Reserved for future use: No internal connection is present. Leave it floating externally.\nNote: 1.

V SS and V SSQ are internally connected.\nMMC Protocol Independent of NAND Flash Technology\nThe MMC specification defines the communication protocol between a host and a de-\nvice. The protocol is independent of the NAND Flash features included in the device.\nThe device has an intelligent on-board controller that manages the MMC communica-\ntion protocol.\nThe controller also handles block management functions such as logical block alloca-\ntion and wear leveling. These management functions require complex algorithms and\ndepend entirely on NAND Flash technology (generation or memory cell type).\nThe device handles these management functions internally, making them invisible to\nthe host processor.\nDefect and Error Management\nMicron e.MMC incorporates advanced technology for defect and error management. If\na defective block is identified, the device completely replaces the defective block with\none of the spare blocks. This process is invisible to the host and does not affect data\nspace allocated for the user.\nThe device also includes a built-in error correction code (ECC) algorithm to ensure that\ndata integrity is maintained.\nTo make the best use of these advanced technologies and ensure proper data loading\nand storage over the life of the device, the host must exercise the following precautions:\n• Check the status after WRITE, READ, and ERASE operations.\n• Avoid power-down during WRITE and ERASE operations.Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n16GB, 32GB, 64GB: e.MMC\nArchitecture\nCCMTD-1725822587-3095\nemmc_16-64gb_ps8222_it.pdf - Rev.
