Pin Functions\nPIN\nTYPE(1)DESCRIPTION\nNAME NO.\nINPUT\nDATA[23:12] 36−47 IThe upper 12 bits of the 24-bit pixel bus\nIn 24-bit, single-edge input mode (BSEL = high), this bus inputs the top half of the 24-bit pixel bus. In \n12-bit, dual-edge input mode (BSEL = low), these bits are not used to input pixel data. In this mode, \nthe state of DATA[23:16] is input to the I2C register CFG. This allows 8 bits of user configuration data \nto be read by the graphics controller through the I2C interface (see Section 6.6).\nNote: All unused data inputs should be tied to GND or V DD.\nDATA[11:0]50−55,\n58−63IThe lower 12 bits of the 24-bit pixel bus/12-bit pixel bus input\nIn 24-bit, single-edge input mode (BSEL = high), this bus inputs the bottom half of the 24-bit pixel \nbus. In 12-bit, dual-edge input mode (BSEL = low), this bus inputs 1/2 a pixel (12 bits) at every latch \nedge (both rising and falling) of the clock.\nIDCK–\nIDCK+56\n57IDifferential clock input. The TFP410  supports both single-ended and fully differential clock input \nmodes. In the single-ended clock input mode, the IDCK+ input (pin 57) should be connected to the \nsingle-ended clock source and the IDCK− input (pin 56) should be tied to GND. In the differential \nclock input mode, the TFP410  uses the crossover point between the IDCK+ and IDCK– signals \nas the timing reference for latching incoming data DATA[23:0], DE, HSYNC, and VSYNC. The \ndifferential clock input mode is only available in the low signal swing mode.\nDE 2 IData enable. As defined in DVI 1.0 specification, the DE signal allows the transmitter to encode pixel \ndata or control data on any given input clock cycle. During active video (DE = high), the transmitter \nencodes pixel data, DATA[23:0]. During the blanking interval (DE = low), the transmitter encodes \nHSYNC, VSYNC and CTL[3:1].\nHSYNC 4 I Horizontal sync input\nVSYNC 5 I Vertical sync input\nA3/DK3\nCTL2/A2/DK2\nCTL1/A1/DK16\n7\n8IThe operation of these three multifunction inputs depends on the settings of the ISEL (pin 13) and \nDKEN (pin 35) inputs. All three inputs support 3.3V CMOS signal levels and contain weak pulldown \nresistors so that if left unconnected they default to all low.\nWhen the I2C bus is disabled (ISEL = low) and the de-skew mode is disabled (DKEN = low), pins 7 \nand 8 become the control inputs, CTL[2:1], which can be used to send additional information across \nthe DVI link during the blanking interval (DE = low). Pin 6 is not used.\nWhen the I2C bus is disabled (ISEL = low) and the de-skew mode is enabled (DKEN = high), these \nthree inputs become the de-skew inputs DK[3:1], used to adjust the setup and hold times of the pixel \ndata inputs DATA[23:0], relative to the clock input IDCK±.\nWhen the I2C bus is enabled (ISEL = high), these three inputs become the 3 LSBs of the I2C target \naddress, A[3:1].\nCONFIGURATION/PROGRAMMING\nMSEN/PO1 11 OMonitor sense/programmable output 1. The operation of this pin depends on whether the I2C \ninterface is enabled or disabled. This pin has an open-drain output and is only 3.3V tolerant. An \nexternal 5kΩ pullup resistor connected to V DD is required on this pin.\nWhen I2C is disabled (ISEL = low), a high level indicates a powered on receiver is detected at the \ndifferential outputs. A low level indicates a powered on receiver is not detected. This function is only \nvalid in dc-coupled systems.\nWhen I2C is enabled (ISEL = high), this output is programmable through the I2C interface (see the \nI2C register descriptions section).\nISEL/ RST 13 II2C interface select/I2C RESET (active low, asynchronous)\nIf ISEL is high, then the I2C interface is active. Default values for the I2C registers can be found in \nthe see Section 6.6.\nIf ISEL is low, then I2C is disabled and the chip configuration is specified by the configuration pins \n(BSEL, DSEL, EDGE, VREF) and state pins (PD, DKEN).\nIf ISEL is brought low and then back high, the I2C state machine is reset. The register values are \nchanged to their default values and are not preserved from before the reset.\nwww.ti.comTFP410\nSLDS145D – OCTOBER 2001 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2024\nCopyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: TFP410\nTable 4-1.

This pin is only 3.3V tolerant.\nWhen I2C is disabled (ISEL = low), a high level selects 24-bit input, single-edge input mode. A low \nlevel selects 12-bit input, dual-edge input mode.\nWhen I2C is enabled (ISEL = high), this pin functions as the I2C clock input (see Section 6.6). In \nthis configuration, this pin has an open-drain output that requires an external 5kΩ pullup resistor \nconnected to V DD.\nDSEL/SDA 14 I/ODSEL/I2C data. The operation of this pin depends on whether the I2C interface is enabled or \ndisabled. This pin is only 3.3V tolerant.\nWhen I2C is disabled (ISEL = low), this pin is used with BSEL and V REF to select the single-ended or \ndifferential input clock mode (see Table 6-1 ).\nWhen I2C is enabled (ISEL = high), this pin functions as the I2C bidirectional data line. In this \nconfiguration, this pin has an open-drain output that requires an external 5kΩ pullup resistor \nconnected to V DD.\nEDGE/HTPLG 9 IEdge select/hot plug input. The operation of this pin depends on whether the I2C interface is enabled \nor disabled. This input is 3.3V tolerant only.\nWhen I2C is disabled (ISEL = low), a high level selects the primary latch to occur on the rising edge \nof the input clock IDCK+. A low level selects the primary latch to occur on the falling edge of the \ninput clock IDCK+. This is the case for both single-ended and differential input clock modes.\nWhen I2C is enabled (ISEL = high), this pin is used to monitor the hot plug detect signal. When used \nfor hot-plug  detection, this pin requires a series\n1kΩ resistor.\nDKEN 35 IData de-skew enable. The de-skew function can be enabled either through I2C or by this pin when \nI2C is disabled. When de-skew is enabled, the input clock to data setup/hold time can be adjusted in \ndiscrete trim increments. The amount of trim per increment is defined by t (STEP) .\nWhen I2C is disabled (ISEL = low), a high level enables de-skew with the trim increment determined \nby pins DK[3:1] (see Section 6.4.2 ). A low level disables de-skew and the default trim setting is used.\nWhen I2C is enabled (ISEL = high), the value of DKEN and the trim increment are selected through \nI2C. In this configuration, the DKEN pin should be tied to either GND or V DD to avoid a floating input.\nVREF 3 IInput reference voltage. Selects the swing range of the digital data inputs (DATA[23:0], DE, HSYNC, \nVSYNC, and IDCK±).\nFor high-swing 3.3V input signal levels, V REF should be tied to V DD.\nFor low-swing input signal levels, V REF should be set to half of the maximum input voltage level. See \nSection 5.3 for the allowable range for V REF.\nThe desired V REF voltage level is typically derived using a simple voltage-divider circuit.\nPD 10 IPower down (active low). In the powerdown state, only the digital I/O buffers and I2C interface \nremain active.\nWhen I2C is disabled (ISEL = low), a high level selects the normal operating mode. A low level \nselects the powerdown mode.\nWhen I2C is enabled (ISEL = high), the power-down state is selected through I2C. In this \nconfiguration, the PD pin should be tied to GND.\nNote: The default register value for PD is low, so the device is in powerdown mode when I2C is first \nenabled or after an I2C RESET.\nRESERVED\nRESERVED 34 I This pin is reserved and must be tied to GND for normal operation.\nDVI DIFFERENTIAL SIGNAL OUTPUT PINS\nTX0+\nTX0−25\n24OChannel 0 DVI differential output pair.

TFP410  supports resolutions from VGA to WUXGA (and 1080p) and can \nbe controlled in two ways:\n1.Configuration and state pins\n2.The programmable I2C serial interface (see Table 6-1 )\nThe host in a digital display system, usually a PC or consumer electronics device, contains a DVI-compatible \ntransmitter such as the TI TFP410  that receives 24-bit pixel data along with appropriate control signals. \nThe TFP410  encodes the signals into a high speed, low voltage, differential serial bit stream optimized for \ntransmission over a twisted-pair cable to a display device. The display device, usually a flat-panel monitor, \nrequires a DVI compatible receiver like the TI TFP401 to decode the serial bit stream back to the same 24-bit \npixel data and control signals that originated at the host. This decoded data can then be applied directly to the \nflat panel drive circuitry to produce an image on the display. Because the host and display can be separated by \ndistances up to 5 meters or more, serial transmission of the pixel data is preferred (see Section 6.3.1 , Section \n6.3.2 , and Section 6.3.3 ).\nThe TFP410  integrates a high-speed digital interface, a T.M.D.S. encoder, and three differential T.M.D.S. \ndrivers. Data is driven to the TFP410  encoder across 12 or 24 data lines, along with differential clock pair \nand sync signals. The flexibility of the TFP410  allows for multiple clock and data formats that enhance system \nperformance.\nThe TFP410  also has enhanced PLL noise immunity, an enhancement accomplished with on-chip regulators and \nbypass capacitors.\nThe TFP410  is versatile and highly programmable to provide maximum flexibility for the user. An I2C host \ninterface is provided to allow enhanced configurations in addition to power-on default settings programmed by \npin-strapping resistors.\nThe TFP410  offers monitor detection through receiver detection, or hot-plug detection when I2C is enabled. The \nmonitor detection feature allows the user enhanced flexibility when attaching to digital displays or receivers (see \nSection 6.4.3  and the see Section 6.6).\nThe TFP410  has a data de-skew feature allowing the users to de-skew  the input data with respect to the IDCK± \n(see Section 6.4.2 ).TFP410\nSLDS145D – OCTOBER 2001 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2024\n www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TFP410\n6.2 Functional Block Diagram\n12/24 Bit\nI/FData\nFormatUniversal Input T.M.D.S.

Pixel Data and Control Signal Encoding\nFor transition minimized differential signaling (T.M.D.S.), only one of two possible T.M.D.S. characters for a given \npixel is transmitted at a given time. The transmitter keeps a running count of the number of ones and zeros \npreviously sent and transmits the character that minimizes the number of transitions and approximates a dc \nbalance of the transmission line. Three T.M.D.S. channels are used to transmit RGB pixel data during the active \nvideo interval (DE = High). These same three channels are also used to transmit HSYNC, VSYNC, and three \ncontrol signals, CTL[3:1], during the inactive display or blanking interval (DE = Low). The following table maps \nthe transmitted output data to the appropriate T.M.D.S. output channel in a DVI-compliant system.\nINPUT PINS\n(VALID FOR DE = High)T.M.D.S.

The allowable range \nof values for V REF is from 0.55V to 0.9V. The typical approach is to provide this from off chip by using a \nsimple voltage-divider circuit. The minimum allowable input signal swing in the low-swing mode is V REF ±0.2V. In \nlow-swing mode, the V REF input is common to all differential input receivers.\n6.3.3 Universal Graphics Controller Interface Clock Inputs\nThe universal graphics controller interface of the TFP410  supports both fully differential and single-ended clock \ninput modes. In the differential clock input mode, the universal graphics controller interface uses the crossover \npoint between the IDCK+ and IDCK − signals as the timing reference for latching incoming data (DATA[23:0], DE, \nHSYNC, and VSYNC). Differential clock inputs provide greater common-mode noise rejection. The differential \nclock input mode is only available in the low-swing mode. In the single-ended clock input mode, the IDCK+ input \n(Pin 57) should be connected to the single-ended clock source and the IDCK − input (Pin 56) should be tied to \nGND.\nThe universal graphics controller interface of the TFP410  provides selectable 12-bit dual-edge, and 24-bit \nsingle-edge, input clocking modes. In the 12-bit dual-edge, the 12-bit data is latched on each edge of the input \nclock. In the 24-bit single-edge mode, the 24-bit data is latched on the rising edge of the input clock when EDGE \n= 1 and the falling edge of the input clock when EDGE = 0.\nDKEN and DK[3:1] allow the user to compensate the skew between IDCK± and the pixel data and control \nsignals. See Table 6-10  for details.\n6.4 Device Functional Modes\n6.4.1 Universal Graphics Controller Interface Modes\nTable 6-1  is a tabular representation of the different modes for the universal graphics controller interface. The \n12-bit mode is selected when BSEL=0 and the 24-bit mode when BSEL=1. The 12-bit mode uses dual-edge \nclocking and the 24-bit mode uses single-edge clocking. The EDGE input is used to control the latching edge in \n24-bit mode, or the primary latching edge in 12-bit mode. When EDGE=1, the data input is latched on the rising \nedge of the input clock; and when EDGE=0, the data input is latched on the falling edge of the input clock. A fully \ndifferential input clock is available only in the low-swing mode. Single-ended clocking is not recommended in the \nlow-swing mode as this decreases common-mode noise rejection.\nNote that BSEL, DSEL, and EDGE are determined by register CTL_1_MODE when I2C is enabled (ISEL=1) and \nby input pins when I2C is disabled (ISEL=0).\nTable 6-1.

Specifically, the input data DATA[23:0] can \nbe latched slightly before or after the latching edge of the clock IDCK± depending on the amount of de-skew \ndesired. When de-skew enable (DKEN) is enabled, the amount of de-skew is programmable by setting the three \nbits DK[3:1]. When disabled, a default de-skew setting is used. To allow maximum flexibility and ease of use, \nDKEN and DK[3:1] are accessed directly through configuration pins when I2C is disabled, or through registers of \nthe same name when I2C is enabled. When using I2C mode, the DKEN pin should be tied to ground to avoid a \nfloating input.TFP410\nSLDS145D – OCTOBER 2001 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2024\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TFP410\nThe input setup/hold time can be varied with respect to the input clock by an amount t (CD) given by the formula in \nEquation 1 .\nt(CD) = (DK[3:1] – 4) × t( STEP) (1)\nwhere\n•t(STEP)  is the adjustment increment amount\n•DK[3:1] is a number from 0 to 7 represented as a 3-bit binary number\n•t(CD) is the cumulative de-skew amount\n(DK[3:1]-4) is simply a multiplier in the range {-4,-3,-2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3} for t (STEP) .

A Graphical Representation of the De-Skew Function\n6.4.3 Hot Plug/Unplug (Auto Connect/Disconnect Detection)\nTFP410  supports hot plug/unplug (auto connect/disconnect detection) for the DVI link. The receiver sense input \n(RSEN) bit indicates if a DVI receiver is connected to TXC+ and TXC–. The HTPLG bit reflects the current state \nof the HTPLG pin connected to the monitor via the DVI connector. When I2C is disabled (ISEL=0), the RSEN \nvalue is available on the MSEN pin. When I2C is enabled, the connection status of the DVI link and HTPLG \nsense pins are provided by the CTL_2_MODE register. The MSEL bits of the CTL_2_MODE register can be \nused to program the MSEN to output the HTPLG value, the RSEN value, an interrupt, or be disabled.\nThe source of the interrupt event is selected by TSEL in the CTL_2_MODE register. An interrupt is generated \nby a change in status of the selected signal. The interrupt status is indicated in the MDI bit of CTL_2_MODE \nand can be output via the MSEN pin. The interrupt continues to be asserted until a 1 is written to the MDI bit, \nresetting the bit back to 0. Writing 0 to the MDI bit has no effect.\n6.4.4 Device Configuration and I2C RESET Description\nThe TFP410  device configuration can be programmed by several different methods to allow maximum flexibility \nfor the user’s application. Device configuration is controlled depending on the state of the ISEL/ RST pin, \nconfiguration pins (BSEL, DSEL, EDGE, V REF) and state pins ( PD, DKEN). I2C bus select and I2C RESET \n(active low) are shared functions on the ISEL/ RST pin, which operates asynchronously.\nHolding ISEL/ RST low causes the device configuration to be set by the configuration pins (BSEL, DSEL, EDGE, \nand V REF) and state pins ( PD, DKEN). The I2C bus is disabled.\nHolding ISEL/ RST high causes the chip configuration to be set based on the configuration bits (BSEL, DSEL, \nEDGE) and state bits ( PD, DKEN) in the I2C registers. The I2C bus is enabled.\nwww.ti.comTFP410\nSLDS145D – OCTOBER 2001 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2024\nCopyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TFP410\nMomentarily bringing ISEL/ RST low and then back high while the device is operating in normal or power-down \nmode will RESET the I2C registers to their default values. The device configuration will be changed to the default \npower-up state with I2C enabled. After power up, the device must be reset. It is suggested that this pin be tied to \nthe system reset signal, which is low during power up and is then asserted high after all the power supplies are \nfully functional.\n6.4.5 DE Generator\nThe TFP410  contains a DE generator that can be used to generate an internal DE signal when the original data \nsource does not provide one. There are several I2C programmable values that control the DE generator (see \nFigure 6-4 ). DE_GEN in the DE_CTL register enables this function. When enabled, the DE pin is ignored.\nDE_TOP and DE_LIN are line counts used to control the number of lines after VSYNC goes active that DE is \nenabled, and the total number of lines that DE remains active, respectively. The polarity of VSYNC must be set \nby VS_POL in the DE_CTL register.\nDE_DLY and DE_CNT are pixel counts used to control the number of pixels after HSYNC goes active that DE is \nenabled, and the total number of pixels that DE remains active, respectively. The polarity of HSYNC must be set \nby HS_POL in the DE_CTL register.\nThe TFP410  also counts the total number of HSYNC pulses between VSYNC pulses, and the total number \nof pixels between HSYNC pulses. These values, the total vertical and horizontal resolutions, are available in \nV_RES and H_RES, respectively. These values are available at all times, whether or not the DE generator is \nenabled.\nActual Display AreaDE_CNT\nDE_LINFull Vertical Frame\nDE_TOP\nV_RES\nH_RESDE_DLY\nFigure 6-4.

The basic I2C access cycles are shown in Figure 6-5  and Figure 6-6 .\nStart Condition (S) Stop Condition (P)SDA\nSCL\nFigure 6-5.

The high to low transition of SDA while SCL is high \ndefines the start condition. The low to high transition of SDA while SCL is high defines the stop condition. \nEach cycle, data or address, consists of 8 bits of serial data followed by one acknowledge bit generated by the \nreceiving device. Thus, each data/address cycle contains 9 bits as shown in Figure 6-6 .\nSCL123456789\nSDA123456789 234567 1\nTarget Address Sub-Address Data Stop8 9\nFigure 6-6.

The sub-address is auto-incremented after each data cycle.\nThe transmitting device must not drive the SDA signal during the acknowledge cycle so that the receiving device \nmay drive the SDA signal low.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n7.1 Application Information\nThe TFP410  is a DVI-compliant digital transmitter that is used in digital host monitor systems to T.M.D.S. encode \nand serialize RGB pixel data streams. TFP410  supports resolutions from VGA to WUXGA (and 1080p). The host \nin a digital display system, usually a PC or consumer electronics device, contains a DVI-compatible transmitter \nsuch as the TI TFP410  that receives 24-bit pixel data along with appropriate control signals. The TFP410 \nencodes the signals into a high speed, low voltage, differential serial bit stream optimized for transmission over a \ntwisted-pair cable to a display device such as the TFP401.\n7.2 Typical Application\nFigure 7-1.

As a general rule, traces also should be less than \n2.8” if possible (longer traces can be acceptable).\nDelay = 85 × SQRT × er (2)\nwhere\n•er = 4.35; relative permativity of 50% resin FR-4 at 1 GHz\n•Delay = 177 pS/in\nLength of rising edge = Tr(ps) / Delay; Tr = 3 ns (3)\nwhere\n•= 3000 ps / 177 ps per inch\n•= 16.9 inches\nLength of rising edge / 6 = Max length of trace for lumped circuit. (4)\n16.9 / 6 = 2.8 inches (5)\nFigure 7-2. Data Signals\n7.2.2.2 Configuration Options\nThe TFP410  can be configured in several modes depending on the required input format, for example 1 byte/\nclock, 2 bytes/clock, falling/rinsing clock edge.\nRefer to Table 6-1  for more information about configuration options.TFP410\nSLDS145D – OCTOBER 2001 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2024\n www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TFP410\n7.2.2.3 Power Supplies Decoupling\nDigital, analog, and PLL supplies must be decoupled from each other to avoid electrical noise on the PLL and \nthe core.\nFigure 7-3.

Tie ground planes together with as many vias as is practical. This will provide a \ndesirable return path for current. Each supply should be on separate split power planes, where each power \nplane should be as large an area as possible. Connect PanelBus receiver power and ground pins and all bypass \ncaps to appropriate power or ground plane with via. Vias should be as fat and short as practical, the goal is to \nminimize the inductance.\n7.3.1 DVDD\nPlace one 0.01µF capacitor as close as possible between each DVDD device pins and ground. A 22µF tantalum \ncapacitor should be placed between the supply and 0.01µF capacitors. A ferrite bead should be used between \nthe source and the 22µF capacitor.\n7.3.2 TVDD\nPlace one 0.01µF capacitor as close as possible between each TVDD device pins and ground. A 22µF tantalum \ncapacitor should be placed between the supply and 0.01µF capacitors. A ferrite bead should be used between \nthe source and the 22µF capacitor.\n7.3.3 PVDD\nPlace three 0.01µF capacitors in parallel as close as possible between the PVDD device pin and ground. A\n22µF tantalum capacitor should be placed between the supply and 0.01µF capacitors. A ferrite bead should be \nused between the source and the 22µF capacitor.\n7.4 Layout\n7.4.1 Layout Guidelines\n7.4.1.1 Layer Stack\nThe pinout of Texas Instruments\' High Speed Interface (HSI) devices features differential signal pairs and the \nremaining signals comprise the supply rails, VCC and ground, and lower-speed signals, such as control pins. \nAs an example, consider a device X which is a repeater/re-driver, so both inputs and outputs are high-speed \ndifferential signals. These guidelines can be applied to other high-speed devices such as drivers, receivers, \nmultiplexers, and so on.\nA minimum of four layers is required to accomplish a low-EMI PCB design. Layer stacking should be in the \nfollowing order (top-to-bottom): high-speed differential signal layer, ground plane, power plane and control signal \nlayer.\nFigure 7-6. PCB Stack UpTFP410\nSLDS145D – OCTOBER 2001 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2024\n www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TFP410\n7.4.1.2 Routing High-Speed Differential Signal Traces\n(RxC-, RxC+, Rx0-, Rx0+, Rx1-, Rx1+, Rx2-, Rx2+)\nTrace impedance should be controlled for optimal performance. Each differential pair should be equal in length \nand symmetrical and should have equal impedance to ground with a trace separation of 2 times to 4 times the \nheight. A differential trace separation of 4 times the height yields about 6% cross-talk (6% effect on impedance).\nWe recommend that differential trace routing should be side-by-side, though it is not important that the \ndifferential traces be tightly coupled together, because tight coupling is not achievable on PCB traces. Typical \nratios on PCBs are only 20% to 50%; 99.9% is the value of a well balanced twisted pair cable. Each \ndifferential trace should be as short as possible (< 2 inches is preferable) with no 90° angles. These high-speed \ntransmission traces should be on layer 1, which is the top layer.\nRxC-, RxC+, Rx0-, Rx0+, Rx1-, Rx1+, Rx2-, Rx2+ signals all route directly from the DVI connector pins to the \ndevice, no external components are needed.\n7.4.1.3 DVI Connector\nClear-out holes for connector pins should leave space between pins to allow continuous ground through the pin \nfield. Allow enough spacing in ground plane around signal pins vias however, keep enough copper between vias \nto allow for ground current to flow between the vias. Avoid creating a large ground plane slot around the entire \nconnector, because minimizing the via capacitance is the goal.\n7.4.2 Layout Example\nDVI connector trace matching is shown in Figure 7-7 .\nFigure 7-7.

The PowerPAD package \nis a 10mm × 10mm × 1.0mm TQFP outline with 0.5mm lead-pitch. The PowerPAD package has a specially \ndesigned die mount pad that offers improved thermal capability over typical TQFP packages of the same outline. \nThe TI 64-pin TQFP PowerPAD package offers a backside solder plane that connects directly to the die mount \npad for enhanced thermal conduction. For thermal considerations, soldering the backside of the TFP410  to the \napplication board is not required because the device power dissipation is well within the package capability when \nnot soldered.\nSoldering the backside of the device to the PCB ground plane is recommended for electrical considerations. \nBecause the die pad is electrically connected to the chip substrate and hence chip ground, connecting the back \nside of the PowerPAD package to a PCG ground plane provides a low-inductance, low-impedance connection to \nhelp improve EMI, ground bounce, and power supply noise performance.\nTable 7-1  contains the thermal properties of the TI 64-pin TQFP PowerPAD package. The 64-pin TQFP non-\nPowerPAD package is included only for reference.\nTable 7-1.
