Derate linearly above 70°C free air temperature at a rate of 0.3 mA/°C.\n2. In order to achieve the absolute maximum power dissipation specified, pins 4, 9, and 10 require ground plane connections and may require \nairflow. See the Thermal Model section in the application notes at the end of this data sheet for details on how to estimate junction temperature \nand power dissipation. In most cases the absolute maximum output IC junction temperature is the limiting factor. The actual power dissipation \nachievable will depend on the application environment (PCB Layout, air flow, part placement, etc.). See the Recommended PCB Layout section \nin the application notes for layout considerations. Output IC power dissipation is derated linearly at 10 mW/°C above 90°C. Input IC power \ndissipation does not require derating.\n3. Maximum pulse width = 10 µs. This value is intended to allow for component tolerances for designs with I O peak minimum = 2.0 A. Derate \nlinearly from 3.0 A at +25°C to 2.5 A at +105°C. This compensates for increased I OPEAK  due to changes in V OL over temperature.\n4. This supply is optional. Required only when negative gate drive is implemented.\n5. Maximum pulse width = 50 µs.\n6. See the Slow IGBT Gate Discharge During Fault Condition section in the applications notes at the end of this data sheet for further details.\n7. 15 V is the recommended minimum operating positive supply voltage (V CC2 - V E) to ensure adequate margin in excess of the maximum V UVLO+  \nthreshold of 12.5V. For High Level Output Voltage testing, V OH is measured with a dc load current. When driving capacitive loads, V OH will \napproach V CC as I OH approaches zero units.\n8. Maximum pulse width = 1.0 ms.\n9. Once V O of the ACPL-332J is allowed to go high (V CC2 - V E > V UVLO+ ), the DESAT detection feature of the ACPL-332J will be the primary source of \nIGBT protection. UVLO is needed to ensure DESAT is functional. Once V CC2 is increased from 0V to above V UVLO+ , DESAT will remain functional \nuntil V CC2 is decreased below V UVLO- . Thus, the DESAT detection and UVLO features of the ACPL-332J work in conjunction to ensure constant \nIGBT protection.\n10. See the DESAT fault detection blanking time section in the applications notes at the end of this data sheet for further details.\n11. This is the “increasing” (i.e. turn-on or “positive going” direction) of V CC2 - VE\n12. This is the “decreasing” (i.e. turn-off or “negative going” direction) of V CC2 - VE\n13. This load condition approximates the gate load of a 1200 V/150A IGBT.\n14. Pulse Width Distortion (PWD) is defined as |t PHL - tPLH| for any given unit.\n15. As measured from I F to V O.\n16. The difference between t PHL and t PLH between any two ACPL-332J parts under the same test conditions.\n17. As measured from ANODE, CATHODE of LED to V OUT\n18. This is the amount of time from when the DESAT threshold is exceeded, until the FAULT output goes low.\n19. This is the amount of time the DESAT threshold must be exceeded before V OUT begins to go low, and the FAULT output to go low. This is supply \nvoltage dependent. \n20. Auto Reset: This is the amount of time when V OUT will be asserted low after DESAT threshold is exceeded. See the Description of Operation (Auto \nReset) topic in the application information section.\n21. Common mode transient immunity in the high state is the maximum tolerable dV CM/dt of the common mode pulse, V CM, to assure that the \noutput will remain in the high state (i.e., V O > 15 V or FAULT > 2 V). \n22. Common mode transient immunity in the low state is the maximum tolerable dV CM/dt of the common mode pulse, V CM, to assure that the \noutput will remain in a low state (i.e., V O < 1.0 V or FAULT < 0.8 V).\n23. To clamp the output voltage at V CC - 3 V BE, a pull-down resistor between the output and V EE is recommended to sink a static current of 650 µA \nwhile the output is high. See the Output Pull-Down Resistor section in the application notes at the end of this data sheet if an output pull-down \nresistor is not used.\n24. In accordance with UL 1577, each optocoupler is proof tested by applying an insulation test voltage ≥ 6000 Vrms for 1 second. This test is \nperformed before the 100% production test for partial discharge (method b) shown in IEC/EN/DIN EN 60747-5-5 Insulation Characteristic Table.\n25. This is a two-terminal measurement: pins 1-8 are shorted together and pins 9-16 are shorted together.\n26. Split resistors network with a ratio of 1:1 is needed at input LED1.

Active Miller clamp function eliminates the \nneed of negative gate drive in most application and \nallows the use of simple bootstrap supply for high side \ndriver. An optically isolated power output stage drives \nIGBTs with power ratings of up to 150 A and 1200 V. A \nhigh speed internal optical link minimizes the propaga -\ntion delays between the microcontroller and the IGBT \nwhile allowing the two systems to operate at very large \ncommon mode voltage differences that are common \nin industrial motor drives and other power switching \napplications. An output IC provides local protection \nfor the IGBT to prevent damage during over current, \nand a second optical link provides a fully isolated fault \nstatus feedback signal for the microcontroller. A built \nin “watchdog” circuit, UVLO monitors the power stage \nsupply voltage to prevent IGBT caused by insufficient \ngate drive voltages. This integrated IGBT gate driver is \ndesigned to increase the performance and reliability of \na motor drive without the cost, size, and complexity of a \ndiscrete design.\nTwo light emitting diodes and two integrated circuits \nhoused in the same SO-16 package provide the input \ncontrol circuitry, the output power stage, and two optical \nchannels. The output Detector IC is designed manufac -\ntured on a high voltage BiCMOS/Power DMOS process. \nThe forward optical signal path, as indicated by LED1, \ntransmits the gate control signal. The return optical signal \npath, as indicated by LED2, transmits the fault status \nfeedback signal. \nUnder normal operation, the LED1 directly controls the \nIGBT gate through the isolated output detector IC, and \nLED2 remains off. When an IGBT fault is detected, the \noutput detector IC immediately begins a “soft” shutdown \nsequence, reducing the IGBT current to zero in a con -\ntrolled manner to avoid potential IGBT damage from \ninductive over voltages. Simultaneously, this fault status \nis transmitted back to the input via LED2, where the fault \nlatch disables the gate control input and the active low \nfault output alerts the microcontroller.\nDuring power-up, the Under Voltage Lockout (UVLO) \nfeature prevents the application of insufficient gate \nvoltage to the IGBT, by forcing the ACPL-332J’s output \nlow. Once the output is in the high state, the DESAT (VCE) \ndetection feature of the ACPL-332J provides IGBT pro -\ntection. Thus, UVLO and DESAT work in conjunction to \nprovide constant IGBT protection.Recommended Application Circuit\nThe ACPL-332J has an LED input gate control, and an \nopen collector fault output suitable for wired ‘OR’ ap -\nplications. The recommended application circuit shown \nin Figure 36 illustrates a typical gate drive implementa -\ntion using the ACPL-332J. The following describes about \ndriving IGBT. However, it is also applicable to MOSFET. \nDepending upon the MOSFET or IGBT gate threshold \nrequirements, designers may want to adjust the VCC \nsupply voltage (Recommended V CC = 17.5V for IGBT and \n12.5V for MOSFET).\nThe two supply bypass capacitors (0.1 µF) provide the \nlarge transient currents necessary during a switching \ntransition. Because of the transient nature of the \ncharging currents, a low current (5mA) power supply \nsuffices. The desaturation diode D DESAT  600V/1200V \nfast recovery type, t rr below 75ns (e.g. ERA34-10) and \ncapacitor C BLANK  are necessary external components for \nthe fault detection circuitry. The gate resistor R G serves to \nlimit gate charge current and controls the IGBT collector \nvoltage rise and fall times. The open collector fault \noutput has a passive pull-up resistor R F (2.1 kW) and a \n1000 pF filtering capacitor, C F. A 47 kW pull down resistor \nRPULL-DOWN  on V OUT provides a predictable high level \noutput voltage (V OH). In this application, the IGBT gate \ndriver will shut down when a fault is detected and fault \nreset by next cycle of IGBT turn on. Application notes are \nmentioned at the end of this datasheet.Figure 35.

The FAULT output is high. See Figure 37.\nFault Condition\nThe DESAT pin monitors the IGBT V ce voltage. When the \nvoltage on the DESAT pin exceeds 6.5 V while the IGBT is \non, V OUT is slowly brought low in order to “softly” turn-off  \nthe IGBT and prevent large di/dt induced voltages. Also \nFigure 37. Fault Timing diagram Figure 36. Recommended application circuit (Single Supply) with desaturation detection and active Miller Clamp \nactivated is an internal feedback channel which brings \nthe FAULT output low for the purpose of notifying the \nmicro-controller of the fault condition. \nFault Reset\nOnce fault is detected, the output will be muted for 5 µs \n(minimum). All input LED signals will be ignored during \nthe mute period to allow the driver to completely soft \nshut-down the IGBT. The fault mechanism can be reset by \nthe next LED turn-on after the 5us (minimum) mute time. \nSee Figure 37.+_+_1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9VE\nVLED\nDESAT\nVCC2\nVEE\nVOUT\nVCLAMP\nVEEVS\nVCC1\nFAULT\nVS\nCATHODE\nANODE\nANODE\nCATHODE+_ RG100 ΩCBLANK\nDDESAT\nQ1\nQ2+\nVCE\n-RF\nR\nRPULL -DOWN+ HVDC\n-HVDC3-PHASE\nAC\n+\nVCE\n-0.1µF\n0.1µF\nCF\n7+_\n-\nIF\nVDESAT\nVOUT\nFAULT6.5VtDESAT(LOW)\n10%tDESAT(10%)\n90%\ntDESAT(90%)\n50%\ntDESAT(FAULT)\ntDESAT(MUTE)Reset done \nduring the next LED turn-on\n50%tBLANK\ntRESET(FAULT)\n20Output Control\nThe outputs (V OUT and FAULT) of the ACPL-332J are con -\ntrolled by the combination of I F, UVLO and a detected \nIGBT Desat condition. Once UVLO is not active (V CC2 - \nVE > V UVLO ), VOUT is allowed to go high, and the DESAT \n(pin 14) detection feature of the ACPL-332J will be the \nprimary source of IGBT protection. Once V CC2 is increased \nfrom 0V to above V UVLO+ , DESAT will remain functional \nuntil V CC2 is decreased below V UVLO- .  Thus, the DESAT \ndetection and UVLO features of the ACPL-332J work in \nconjunction to ensure constant IGBT protection.\nDesaturation Detection and High Current Protection \nThe ACPL-332J satisfies these criteria by combining a \nhigh speed, high output current driver, high voltage \noptical isolation between the input and output, local \nIGBT desaturation detection and shut down, and an \noptically isolated fault status feedback signal into a single \n16-pin surface mount package.\nThe fault detection method, which is adopted in the \nACPL-332J, is to monitor the saturation (collector) \nvoltage of the IGBT and to trigger a local fault shutdown \nsequence if the collector voltage exceeds a predeter -\nmined threshold. A small gate discharge device slowly \nreduces the high short circuit IGBT current to prevent \ndamaging voltage spikes. Before the dissipated energy \ncan reach destructive levels, the IGBT is shut off. During \nthe off state of the IGBT, the fault detect circuitry is simply \ndisabled to prevent false ‘fault’ signals.\nThe alternative protection scheme of measuring IGBT \ncurrent to prevent desaturation is effective if the short \ncircuit capability of the power device is known, but \nthis method will fail if the gate drive voltage decreases \nenough to only partially turn on the IGBT. By directly \nmeasuring the collector voltage, the ACPL-332J limits the \npower dissipation in the IGBT even with insufficient gate \ndrive voltage. Another more subtle advantage of the de -\nsaturation detection method is that power dissipation in \nthe IGBT is monitored, while the current sense method \nrelies on a preset current threshold to predict the safe \nlimit of operation. Therefore, an overly conservative over \ncurrent threshold is not needed to protect the IGBT.Slow IGBT Gate Discharge during Fault Condition\nWhen a desaturation fault is detected, a weak pull-down \ndevice in the ACPL-332J output drive stage will turn on \nto ‘softly’ turn off the IGBT. This device slowly discharges \nthe IGBT gate to prevent fast changes in drain current \nthat could cause damaging voltage spikes due to lead \nand wire inductance. During the slow turn off, the large \noutput pull-down device remains off until the output \nvoltage falls below V EE + 2 Volts, at which time the large \npull down device clamps the IGBT gate to V EE.\nDESAT Fault Detection Blanking Time\nThe DESAT fault detection circuitry must remain disabled \nfor a short time period following the turn-on of the IGBT \nto allow the collector voltage to fall below the DESAT \nthreshold. This time period, called the DESAT blanking \ntime is controlled by the internal DESAT charge current, \nthe DESAT voltage threshold, and the external DESAT \ncapacitor. \nThe nominal blanking time is calculated in terms of \nexternal capacitance (C BLANK ), FAULT threshold voltage \n(VDESAT ), and DESAT charge current (I CHG) as t BLANK  = \nCBLANK  x V DESAT  / I CHG. The nominal blanking time with \nthe recommended 100pF capacitor is 100pF * 6.5 V / 240 \nµA = 2.7 µsec. \nThe capacitance value can be scaled slightly to adjust the \nblanking time, though a value smaller than 100 pF is not \nrecommended. This nominal blanking time represents \nthe longest time it will take for the ACPL-332J to respond \nto a DESAT fault condition. If the IGBT is turned on while \nthe collector and emitter are shorted to the supply rails \n(switching into a short), the soft shut-down sequence \nwill begin after approximately 3 µsec. If the IGBT collector \nand emitter are shorted to the supply rails after the IGBT \nis already on, the response time will be much quicker due \nto the parasitic parallel capacitance of the DESAT diode. \nThe recommended 100pF capacitor should provide \nadequate blanking as well as fault response times for \nmost applications.\nIF UVLO(V CC2-VE) DESAT Function Pin 3 (FAULT) Output VOUT\nON Active Not Active High Low\nON Not Active Active (with DESAT fault) Low (FAULT) Low\nON Not Active Active (no DESAT fault) High (or no fault) High\nOFF Active Not Active High Low\nOFF Not Active Not Active High Low\n21Figure 38. Output pull-down resistor. Under Voltage Lockout\nThe ACPL-332J Under Voltage Lockout (UVLO) feature is \ndesigned to prevent the application of insufficient gate \nvoltage to the IGBT by forcing the ACPL-332J output \nlow during power-up. IGBTs typically require gate \nvoltages of 15 V to achieve their rated V CE(ON)  voltage. \nAt gate voltages below 13 V typically, the V CE(ON)  voltage \nincreases dramatically, especially at higher currents. \nAt very low gate voltages (below 10 V), the IGBT may \noperate in the linear region and quickly overheat. \nThe UVLO function causes the output to be clamped \nwhenever insufficient operating supply (V CC2) is applied. \nOnce V CC2 exceeds V UVLO+  (the positive-going UVLO \nthreshold), the UVLO clamp is released to allow the \ndevice output to turn on in response to input signals. As \nVCC2 is increased from 0 V (at some level below V UVLO+ ), \nfirst the DESAT protection circuitry becomes active. As \nVCC2 is further increased (above V UVLO+ ), the UVLO clamp \nis released. Before the time the UVLO clamp is released, \nthe DESAT protection is already active. Therefore, the \nUVLO and DESAT Fault detection feature work together \nto provide seamless protection regardless of supply \nvoltage (V CC2).\nActive Miller Clamp\nA Miller clamp allows the control of the Miller current \nduring a high dV/dt situation and can eliminate the use \nof a negative supply voltage in most of the applications. \nDuring turn-off, the gate voltage is monitored and the \nclamp output is activated when gate voltage goes below \n2V (relative to V EE). The clamp voltage is V OL+2.5V typ \nfor a Miller current up to 1100mA. The clamp is disabled \nwhen the LED input is triggered again.\nOther Recommended Components\nThe application circuit in Figure 36 includes an output \npull-down resistor, a DESAT pin protection resistor, a \nFAULT pin capacitor, and a FAULT pin pullup resistor and \nActive Miller Clamp connection. \nOutput Pull-Down Resistor\nDuring the output high transition, the output voltage \nrapidly rises to within 3 diode drops of V CC2. If the output \ncurrent then drops to zero due to a capacitive load, the \noutput voltage will slowly rise from roughly V CC2-3(V BE) \nto V CC2 within a period of several microseconds. To limit \nthe output voltage to V CC2-3(V BE), a pull-down resistor, \nRPULL-DOWN  between the output and V EE is recommend -\ned to sink a static current of several 650 µA while the \noutput is high. Pull-down resistor values are dependent \non the amount of positive supply and can be adjusted \naccording to the formula, R pull-down  = [V CC2-3 * (V BE)] / \n650 µA. 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9VE\nVLED\nDESAT\nVCC2\nVEE\nVOUT\nVCLAMP\nVEEVS\nVCC1\nFAULT\nVS\nCATHODE\nANODE\nANODE\nCATHODERG\nRPULL -DOWNVCC1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9VE\nVLED\nDESAT\nVCC2\nVEE\nVOUT\nVCLAMP\nVEEVS\nVCC1\nFAULT\nVS\nCATHODE\nANODE\nANODE\nCATHODERG\nRPULL -DOWNVCC\nDESAT Pin Protection Resistor\nThe freewheeling of flyback diodes connected across \nthe IGBTs can have large instantaneous forward voltage \ntransients which greatly exceed the nominal forward \nvoltage of the diode.

To \nlimit this current to levels that will not damage the driver \nIC, a 100 ohm resistor should be inserted in series with \nthe DESAT diode.
