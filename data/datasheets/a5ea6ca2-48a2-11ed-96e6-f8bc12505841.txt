No external \ncomponents are required. A single 3.3V or 5V supply \npowers both sides of the interface through an integrated, \nisolated DC/DC converter. A logic supply pin allows easy \ninterfacing with different logic levels from 1.62V to 5.5V, \nindependent of the main supply.\nCoupled inductors and an isolation power transformer \nprovide 2500V RMS of isolation between the line transceiver  \nand the logic interface. This device is ideal for systems \nwith different grounds, allowing for large common mode \nvoltages. Uninterrupted communication is guaranteed for \ncommon mode transients greater than 30kV/μs.  This part is compatible with the TIA/EIA-232-F standard.  \nDriver outputs are protected from overload and can be \nshorted to ground or up to ±15V without damage. An \nauxiliary isolated digital channel is available. This channel \nallows configuration for half-duplex operation by control -\nling the DE pin. \nEnhanced\n ESD protection allows this part to withstand up \nto ±10kV (human body model) on the transceiver interface \npins to isolated supplies and across the isolation barrier \nto logic supplies without latchup or damage.\nIsolated Dual RS232 µModule T ransceiverFEATURES\nAPPLICATIONSn RS 232 T ransceiver: 2500V RMS for 1 Minute\nn UL -CSA Recognized \n  File #E151738 \nn CSA  Component Acceptance Notice 5A\nn Isolated DC Power: 5V at Up to 200mA\nn No External Components Required\nn 1.62V to 5.5V Logic Supply for Flexible Digital \nInterfacing\nn High Speed Operation\n \n1Mbps for 250pF/3kΩ Load\n \n250kbps for 1nF/3kΩ Load\n \n100kbps for 2.5nF/3kΩ TIA/EIA-232-F Load\nn 3.3V (LTM2882-3) or 5V (LTM2882-5) Operation \nn No Damage or Latchup to ±10kV HBM ESD on Isolated RS232 Interface or Across Isolation Barrier\nn High Common Mode T ransient Immunity: 30kV/μs\nn Maximum Continuous Working Voltage: 560V PEAK\nn T rue RS232 Compliant Output Levels\nn 15mm × 11.25mm BGA and LGA Packages\nn Isolated RS232 Interface\nn Industrial Communication\nn Test and Measurement Equipment\nn Breaking RS232 Ground Loops\n1Mbps Operation\n2882 TA01aON\nDIN\nT1INR1OUTT2INR2OUTDOUT\nT1OUT\nR1IN\nT2OUT\nR2INL TM28823.3V (L TM2882-3)\n5V (L TM2882-5)\nVLVCC\nGND GND2\nISOLATION BARRIERON OFFVCC2\nDE5V\nAVAILABLE CURRENT:150mA (L TM2882-5)100mA (L TM2882-3)\n400ns/DIV\nDRIVER OUTPUTS TIED TO RECEIVER INPUTSTOUT LOAD = 250pF + RINROUT LOAD = 150pF10V/DIV5V/DIVTIN\nT1OUT/R1IN\nT2OUT/R2IN\n5V/DIV\n2882 TA01b\nR1OUT\nR2OUT\nLTM28822\n2882fh\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM2882PIN CONFIGURATION ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nVCC to GND  .................................................. –0.3V to 6V\nVL to GND  .................................................... –0. 3V to 6V\nVCC2 to GND 2  ............................................... –0.3V to 6V\nLogic  Inputs  \nT1IN, T2 IN, ON, DIN  to GND  ........ –0.3V to (VL + 0.3 V) \nDE to GND 2............................. –0.3V to (VCC2 + 0.3 V)\nLogic  Outputs  \nR1OU T , R2OUT to GND  ............... –0.3V to (VL + 0.3 V) \nDOUT  to GND 2  ........................ – 0.3V to (VCC2 + 0.3 V)\nDriver  Output  Voltage  \nT1OU T , T2OUT to GND 2  ........................... –15V to 15V\nReceiver  Input  Voltage  \nR1IN, R2 IN to GND 2  ............................... –2 5V to  25V\nOperating  Temperature  Range  (Note 4) \nLTM28 82 C  ......................................... 0°C ≤ T A ≤ 70° C \nLTM28 82 I  ..................................... –40°C ≤ T A ≤ 85° C\n LT\nM2882 H\n .................................. –4\n0°C ≤ T A ≤ 105° C\nMaximum  Internal  Operating  Temperature  \n............ 125°C\nStorage  Temperature  Range  \n.................. –40°C to 125° C\nPeak Package  Body  Reflow  Temperature  \n.............. 245°C(Note 1)\nVCC\nGND\nGND2A\nBC\nD\nE\nF\nGH\nI\nJ\nK\nL1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nLGA PACKAGE\n32-PIN (15mm × 11.25mm × 2.8mm)\nT\nJMAX  = 125°C,\nθJA = 29°C/W , θ JCtop  = 27.9°C/W ,\nθJCbottom  = 18°C/W , θ JB = 22.7°C/W ,\nWEIGHT = 1.1gBGA PACKAGE\n32-PIN (15mm × 11.25mm × 3.42mm)\nTJMAX  = 125°C,\nθJA = 30°C/W , θ JCtop  = 27.8°C/W ,\nθJCbottom  = 19.3°C/W , θ JB = 24°C/W ,\nWEIGHT = 1.1gTOP VIEW\nVCC2VLON DIN T1IN R1OUT T2IN\nDE DOUT T1OUT R1IN T2OUT R2INR2OUT\nLTM28823\n2882fh\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM2882ORDER INFORMATION\nPART  NUMBERINPUT \nVOL TAGEPAD OR BALL \nFINISHPART  MARKING PACKAGE \nTYPEMSL \nRATING TEMPERATURE RANGE DEVICE FINISH CODE\nLTM2882CY-3#PBF\n3V to 3.6V\nSAC305 \n(RoHS)LTM2882Y-3\ne1 BGA\n30°C to 70°C \nLTM2882IY-3#PBF –40°C to 85°C \nLTM2882HY-3#PBF –40°C to 105°C \nLTM2882CY-5#PBF\n4.5V to 5.5V LTM2882Y-50°C to 70°C \nLTM2882IY-5#PBF –40°C to 85°C \nLTM2882HY-5#PBF –40°C to 105°C \nLTM2882CV-3#PBF3V to 3.6V\nAu (RoHS)LTM2882V-3\ne4 LGA0°C to 70°C \nLTM2882IV-3#PBF –40°C to 85°C \nLTM2882CV-5#PBF4.5V to 5.5V LTM2882V-50°C to 70°C \nLTM2882IV-5#PBF –40°C to 85°C \n•\n Device\n temperature grade is indicated by a label on the shipping \ncontainer .\n•\n Pad\n or ball finish code is per IPC/JEDEC J-STD-609.\n• Terminal Finish Part Marking: www.linear .com/leadfree\n•\n This\n product is not recommended for second side reflow.

The LTM2882 is ideal for use in networks \nwhere grounds can take on different voltages. Isolation in \nthe LTM2882 blocks high voltage differences, eliminates \nground loops and is extremely tolerant of common mode \ntransients between grounds. Error-free operation is main -\ntained through  common mode events greater than 30kV/\nμs providing excellent noise isolation.\nµModule Technology\nThe LTM2882 utilizes isolator µModule technology to \ntranslate signals and power across an isolation barrier. \nSignals on either side of the barrier are encoded into pulses  \nand translated across the isolation boundary using core -\nless transformers  formed in the µModule substrate. This \nsystem, complete with data refresh, error checking, safe \nshutdown on fail, and extremely high common mode im -\nmunity, provides  a robust solution for bidirectional signal \nisolation. The µModule technology provides the means \nto combine the isolated signaling with our advanced dual \nRS232 transceiver and powerful isolated DC/DC converter \nin one small package.\nDC/DC Converter\nThe LTM2882 contains a fully integrated isolated DC/DC \nconverter, including the transformer, so that no external \ncomponents are  necessar y. The logic side contains a full-\nbridge driver, running at about 2MHz, and is AC-coupled \nto a single transformer primary. A series DC blocking \ncapacitor prevents transformer saturation due to driver \nduty cycle imbalance. The transformer scales the primary \nvoltage, and is rectified by a full-wave voltage doubler. \nThis topology eliminates transformer saturation caused \nby secondary imbalances.\nThe DC/DC converter is connected to a low dropout regulator  \n(LDO) to provide a regulated low noise 5 V output, VCC2. \nAn integrated boost converter generates a 7V V DD supply \nand a charge pumped – 6.3V V EE supply. VDD and V EE power  \nthe output stage of the RS232 drivers and are regulated \nto levels that guarantee greater than ±5V output swing. The internal power solution is sufficient to support the \ntransceiver interface at its maximum specified load and \ndata rate, and has the capacity to provide additional 5V \npower on the isolated side V CC2 and GND2 pins. V CC and \nVCC2 are each bypassed internally with 2.2µF ceramic \ncapacitors.\nVL Logic Supply\nA separate logic supply pin V L allows the LTM2882 to in-\nterface with  any logic signal from 1.62V to 5.5V as shown \nin\n Figure 5. Simply connect the desired logic supply to V L. \nThere is no interdependency between V CC and V L; they \nmay simultaneously operate at any voltage within their \nspecified operating ranges and sequence in any order. V L \nis bypassed internally by a 2.2µF capacitor.Hot Plugging Safely\nCaution must be exercised in applications where power is \nplugged into the LTM2882’s power supplies, V\nCC or V L, \ndue to the integrated ceramic decoupling capacitors. The \nparasitic cable inductance along with the high Q char -\nacteristics of  ceramic capacitors can cause substantial \nringing which could exceed the maximum voltage ratings \nand damage the LTM2882. Refer to Analog Devices Ap -\nplication Note  88, entitled “Ceramic Input Capacitors Can \nCause Overvoltage T ransients” for a detailed discussion \nand mitigation of this phenomenon.\nLTM288213\n2882fh\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM2882Channel Timing Uncertainty\nMultiple channels are supported across the isolation bound -\nary by  encoding and decoding of the inputs and outputs. \nThe technique used assigns T1 IN/R1 IN the highest priority  \nsuch that there is no jitter on the associated output chan -\nnels T 1OUT/R1OUT, only delay. This preemptive scheme \nwill produce a certain amount of uncertainty on T2IN/\nR2IN to T2OUT/R2OUT and DIN to DOUT. The resulting \npulse width uncertainty on these low priority channels is \ntypically ±6ns, but may vary up to about 40ns. \nHalf-Duplex Operation\nThe DE pin serves as a low-latency driver enable for half-\nduplex operation. The DE pin can be easily driven from \nthe logic side by using the uncommitted auxiliary digital \nchannel, DIN to DOUT. Each driver is enabled and disabled \nin less than 2µs, while each receiver remains continuously \nactive. This mode of operation is illustrated in Figure 6.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 6.

The maximum current is limited to no \nmore than 70mA to maintain a safe power dissipation and \nprevent damaging the LTM2882.\nReceiver Overvoltage and Open Circuit\nThe receiver inputs are protected from common mode \nvoltages of ±25V relative to GND2.Each receiver input has a nominal input impedance of 5kΩ \nrelative to GND2. An open circuit condition will generate a \nlogic high on each receiver’s respective output pin.\nRF, Magnetic Field Immunity\nThe LTM2882 has been independently evaluated and has \nsuccessfully passed the RF and magnetic field immunity \ntesting requirements per European Standard EN 55024, \nin accordance with the following test standards:EN 61000-4-3\n Radiated\n, Radio-Frequency,  \n Electromagnetic  Field Immunity\nEN 61000-4-8\n Power\n Frequency  \n Magnetic  Field Immunity\nEN 61000-4-9\n Pulsed\n Magnetic Field Immunity\nTests were performed using an unshielded test card de -\nsigned per  the data sheet PCB layout recommendations. \nSpecific limits per test are detailed in Table 1.\nTable 1\nTEST FREQUENCY FIELD STRENGTH\nEN 61000-4-3, Annex D 80MHz to 1GHz 10V/m\n1.4MHz to 2GHz 3V/m\n2GHz to 2.7GHz 1V/m\nEN 61000-4-8, Level 4 50Hz and 60Hz 30A/m\nEN 61000-4-8, Level 5 60Hz 100A/m*\nEN 61000-4-9, Level 5 Pulse 1000A/m\n*Non IEC Method\nLTM288214\n2882fh\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM2882APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPCB Layout\nThe high integration of the LTM2882 makes PCB layout \nvery simple. However, to optimize its electrical isolation \ncharacteristics, EMI, and thermal performance, some \nlayout considerations are necessary.•\n Under\n heavily loaded conditions V CC and GND current \ncan exceed 300mA. Sufficient copper must be used \non the PCB to insure resistive losses do not cause the \nsupply voltage to drop below the minimum allowed \nlevel. Similarly, the V CC2 and GND2 conductors must \nbe sized to support any external load current. These \nheavy copper traces will also help to reduce thermal \nstress and improve the thermal conductivity.\n•\n I\nnput and Output  decoupling is not required, since  these \ncomponents are integrated within the package. An ad -\nditional bulk  capacitor with a value of 6.8µF to 22µF is \nrecommended. The high ESR of this capacitor reduces \nboard resonances and minimizes voltage spikes caused by hot plugging of the supply voltage. For EMI sensitive \napplications, an additional low ESL ceramic capacitor of \n1µF to 4.7µF, placed as close to the power and ground terminals as possible, is recommended. Alternatively, a \nnumber of smaller value parallel capacitors may be used \nto reduce ESL and achieve the same net capacitance.\n•\n Do\n not place copper  on the PCB between the inner col-\numns of  pads.  This area must remain open to withstand \nthe rated isolation voltage.\n•\n The\n use of solid ground planes for GND and GND2 \nis recommended for non-EMI critical applications to \noptimize signal fidelity, thermal performance, and to \nminimize RF emissions due to uncoupled PCB trace \nconduction. The drawback of using ground planes, \nwhere EMI is of concern, is the creation of a dipole antenna structure which can radiate differential voltages \nformed between GND and GND2. If ground planes are \nused it is recommended to minimize their area, and \nuse contiguous planes as any openings or splits can \nexacerbate RF emissions.  \n•\n For\n large ground planes a small capacitance (≤ 330pF) \nfrom GND to GND2, either discrete or embedded within \nthe substrate, provides a low impedance current return \npath for the module parasitic capacitance, minimizing \nany high frequency differential voltages and substantially  \nreducing radiated emissions. Discrete capacitance will \nnot be as effective due to parasitic ESL. In addition, volt -\nage rating , leakage, and clearance must be considered \nfor component selection. Embedding the capacitance \nwithin the PCB substrate provides a near ideal capacitor \nand eliminates component selection issues; however, \nthe PCB must be 4 layers. Care  must be exercised in \napplying either technique to insure the voltage rating \nof the barrier is not compromised.  \nThe PCB layout in Figures 7a to 7e show the low EMI \ndemo board for the LTM2882. The demo board uses a \ncombination of EMI mitigation techniques, including both \nembedded PCB bridge capacitance and discrete GND to \nGND2 capacitors. Tw o safety rated type Y2 capacitors \nare used in series, manufactured by Murata, part number \nGA342QR7GF471KW01L. The embedded capacitor ef -\nfectively suppresses  emissions above 400MHz, whereas \nthe discrete capacitors are more effective below 400MHz.\nEMI performance is shown in Figure 8, measured using \na Gigahertz T ransverse Electromagnetic (GTEM) cell and method detailed in IEC 61000-4-20, “Testing and Mea -\nsurement T\nechniques – Emission and Immunity Testing \nin T ransverse Electromagnetic Waveguides.”\nLTM288215\n2882fh\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM2882APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nTECHNOLOGY\nFigure 7a.
