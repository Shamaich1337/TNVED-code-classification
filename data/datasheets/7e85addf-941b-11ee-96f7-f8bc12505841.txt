These devices candrive the gate of the topside MOSFETs whose source nodeis a dynamically changing node. The bias for the high sidedriver in these devices is usually provided through abootstrap circuit.\nIn a bid to make modern power supplies more compact\nand efficient, power supply designers are increasingly\nopting for high frequency operations. High frequency\noperation causes higher losses in the drivers, hence reducing\nthe efficiency of the power supply.\nNCP51530 is a 700 V high side −low side driver for\nAC−DC power supplies and inverters. NCP51530 offers\nbest in class propagation delay, low quiescent current andlow switching current at high frequencies of operation. Thisdevice thus enables highly efficient power supplies\noperating at high frequencies.\nNCP51530 is offered in two versions, NCP51530A/B.\nNCP51530A has a typical 60 ns propagation delay, whileNCP51530B has propagation delay of 25 ns.\nNCP51530 comes in SOIC8 and DFN10 packages.\nSOIC8 package of the device is pin to pin compatible withindustry standard solutions.\nNCP51530 has two independent input pins HIN and LIN\nallowing it to be used in a variety of applications. This device\nalso includes features wherein, in case of floating input, the\nlogic is still defined. Driver inputs are compatible with both\nCMOS and TTL logic hence it provides easy interface with\nanalog and digital controllers. NCP51530 has under voltage\nlock out feature for both high and low side drivers whichensures operation at correct V\nCC and V B voltage levels. The\noutput stage of NCP51530 has 3.5 A/3 A current source/sink\ncapability which can ef fectively charge and discharge a 1 nF\nload in 15 ns.\nFEATURES\nINPUT STAGES\nNCP51530 has two independent input pins HIN and LIN\nallowing it to be used in a variety of applications. The input\nstages of NCP51530 are TTL and CMOS compatible. This\nensures that the inputs of NCP51530 can be driven with\n3.3 V or 5 V logic signals from analog or digital PWMcontrollers or logic gates.\nThe input pins have Schmitt triggers to avoid noise\ninduced logic errors. The hysteresis on the input pins istypically 1.3 V . This high value ensures good noiseimmunity.\nNCP51530 comes with an important feature wherein\noutputs (HO, LO) stays low in case any of the input pin is\nfloating. At both the input pins there is an internal pull down\nresistor to define its logic value in case the pin is left openor NCP51530 is driven by open drain signal. The input logicis explained in the Table 7 below.\nNCP51530 input pins are also tolerant to negative voltage\nbelow the GND pin level as long as it is within the ratingsdefined in the datasheet. This tolerance allows the use of\ntransformer as an isolation barrier for input pulses.\nNCP51530A features a noise rejection function to ensure\nthat any pulse glitch shorter than 30 ns will not produce any\noutput. These features are well illustrated in the Figure 26below.\nNCP51530B has no such filters in the input stages. The\ntiming diagram NCP51530B is Figure 27 below.\nTable 7.

UVLO Timing DiagramVCCON\nLIN\nLO\nHIN\nHOVBONVCCOFF\nVCC\nVB − VHB\nUNDER VOLTAGE LOCK −OUT\nNCP51530 has under voltage lockout protection on both\nthe high side and the low side driver. The function of theUVLO circuits is to ensure that there is enough supplyvoltages (V\nCC and V B) to correctly bias high side and low\nside circuits. This also ensures that the gate of external\nMOSFETs are driven at an optimum voltage.If the V CC is below the V CC UVLO voltage, the low side\ndriver output (LO) and high side driver output (HO) bothremain low.\nIf V\nB is below V B UVLO voltage the high side driver\noutput (HO) remains low. However if the V CC is above V CC\nUVLO voltage level, the low side driver output (LO) can\nstill turn on and off based on the low side driver input (LI)\nNCP51530\nwww. onsemi.com\n16and is not affected by the V B status. This ensures proper\ncharging of the bootstrap capacitor to bring the high side bias\nsupply V B above UVLO voltage.\nBoth the V CC and V B UVLO circuits are provided with\nhysteresis feature. This hysteresis feature avoids errors due\nto ground noise in the power supply. The hysteresis alsoensures continuous operation in case of a small drop in the\nbias voltage. This drop in the bias can happen when devicestarts switching MOSFET and the operating current of the\ndevice increases. The UVLO feature of the device is\nexplained in the Figure 28.\nFigure 29. NCP51530 Turn ON −OFF Paths\nOUTPUT STAGES\nThe NCP51530 is equipped with two independent drivers.\nThe output stage of  NCP51530 has 3.5 A/3 A currentsource/sink capability which can effectively charge anddischarge a 1 nF load in 15 ns.\nThe outputs of NCP51530 can be turned on at the same\ntime and there is no internal dead −time built between them.\nThis allows NCP51530 to be used in topologies like twoswitch forward converter.\nThe figure below show the output stage structure and the\ncharging and discharging path of the external powerMOSFET. The bias supply V\nCC or V B supply the energy to\ncharge the gate capacitance Cgs of the low side or the topside external MOSFETs respectively. When a logic high is\nreceived from input stage, Qsource turns on and V CC/VB\nstarts charging Cgs through Rg. Once the Cgs is charged to\nthe drive voltage level the external power MOSFET turns on\nthe external MOSFET to discharge to GND/HB level.\nWhen a logic low signal is received from the input stage,\nQsource turns off and Qsink turns on providing a path forgate terminal of\nAs seen in the figure, there are parasitic inductances in\ncharging and dischar ging path of the Cgs. This can result in\na little dip in the bias voltages V\nCC/VB. If the V CC/VB drops\nbelow UVLO the power supply can shut down the device.\nNCP51530\nwww. onsemi.com\n17\nFigure 30.

NCP51530A has a typical of60 ns propagation delay. The best in class propagation delay\nin NCP51530 makes it suitable for high frequencyoperation.Since NCP51530B doesn’t have the input filter included,\nthe propagation delay are even faster.

Bootstrap Circuit\nCOMPONENT SELECTION\nCBOOT  CAPACITOR VALUE CALCULATION\nNCP51530 has two independent drivers for driving high\nside and low side external MOSFET s. The bias for the high\nside driver is usually provided through a bootstrap circuit. A\ntypical bootstrap circuit is shown in the figure 8 below.\nThe high side driver is biased by the C boot (bootstrap\ncapacitor). As can be seen in the circuit, C boot will charge\nonly when HB goes to GND level. Low value of C boot can\nresult in a little dip in the bias voltages V B. If the V B drops\nbelow UVLO the power supply can shut down the high side\ndriver. Therefore choosing the right value of C boot is very\nimportant for a robust design.\nAn example design for C boot is given below.\nQg/C004330 nC, VCC/C004315 V (eq. 1)\nQb/C0043IBQ*tdischarge/C004381/C0109C*5 /C0109S/C0043405 pC (eq. 2)\nQtot/C0043Qg/C0041Qb/C004330 nC /C0041405p/C004330.4 pC (eq. 3)\nCboot/C0043Qtot\nVripple/C004330.4 nC\n150 mV/C0043203 nF (eq. 4)\nQg is equivalent gate charge of the FET\nIBQ is the boot quiescent current\ntdishcharge  is the discharge time for bootstrap capacitor\nVripple is the allowed ripple voltage in the bootstrap\ncapacitorIt is recommended to use a larger value so as to cover any\nvariations in the gate charge and voltage with temperature.\nRboot RESISTOR VALUE CALCULATION\nRboot resistor value is very important to ensure proper\nfunction of the device. A high value of R boot would slow\ndown the charging of the C boot while too low a value would\npush very high charging currents for C boot. For NCP51530\na value between 2 /C0087 and 10 /C0087 is recommended for R boot.\nFor example R boot = 5 /C0087\nIboot(pk)/C0043VCC/C0042VD\nRboot/C004315 V/C00421V\n5/C0087/C00432.8 A (eq. 5)\nWhere V D is the bootstrap diode forward drop.\nThus, R boot value of 5 /C0087 keeps the peak current below 2.8 A.\nHIN AND LIN INPUT FILTER\nFor PWM connection on the LIN and HIN pin of the\nNCP51530, a RC is recommended to filter high frequencyinput noise.\nThis filter is particularly important in case of NCP51530B\nwhere no internal filter is included.\nThe recommended value for R\nLIN/RHIN and C HIN/CLIN\nare as below.\nRLIN/RHIN = 100 /C0087\nCHIN/CLIN = 120 pF\nNCP51530\nwww. onsemi.com\n21VCC CAPACITOR SELECTION\nVCC capacitor value should be selected at least ten times\nthe value of C boot. In this case thus C VCC > 2 /C0109F.\nRgate SELECTION\nRgate are selected to limit the peak gate current during\ncharging and discharging of the gate capacitance. Thisresistance also helps to damp the ringing due to the parasitic\ninductances.\nFor example for a R\ngate value of 5 /C0087, the peak source and\nsink currents would be limited to the following values.\nRgate/C00435/C0087 (eq. 6)\nILO_Source/C0043VCC\nRLgate/C0041RLOH/C004315 V\n6.7/C0087/C00432.23 A (eq. 7)\nILO_Sink/C0043VCC\nRLgate/C0041RLOL/C004315 V\n6.8/C0087/C00432.20 A (eq. 8)\nIHO_Source/C0043VCC/C0042VDboot\nRLgate/C0041RHOH/C004314 V\n6.7/C0087/C00432.09 A (eq. 9)\nIHO_Sink/C0043VCC/C0042VDboot\nRLgate/C0041RHOL/C004315 V/C00421V\n6.8/C0087/C00432.06 A(eq. 10)\nTOTAL POWER DISSIPATION\nTotal power dissipation of NCP51530 can  be calculated as\nfollows.\n1.

To avoid any device malfunction during\ndevice operation, it is very important that there is very low\nparasitic inductance in the current switching path. It is very\nimportant that the best layout practices are followed for thePCB layout of the NCP51530. An example layout is shownin the figure below. Some of the layout rules to be followedare listed below.\n•Keep the low side drive path LO −Q1−GND as small as\npossible. This reduces the parasitic inductance in the\npath and hence eliminates ringing on the gate terminal\nof the low side MOSFET Q1.\n•Keep the high side drive loop HO −Q2−HB as small as\npossible. This reduces the parasitic inductance in thepath and hence eliminates ringing on the gate terminal\nof the low side MOSFET Q1.\n•Keep C VCC  as near to the V CC pin as possible and the\nVCC−CVCC−GND loop as small as possible.\n•Keep C VB as near to VB pin as possible and\nVB−CVB−HB loop as small as possible.\n•Keep the HB −GND−Q1 loop as small as possible. This\nloop has the potential to produce a negative voltage\nspike on the HB pin. This negative voltage spike cancause damage to the driver. This negative spike can\nincrease the boot capacitor voltage above the maximum\nrating and hence cause damage to the driver.\nFigure 35. Example Layout\nIMPACT IONIZATION CURRENT\nNCP51530 tends to exhibit an Impact Ionization current\nthat flows from the boot pin (VB) to ground (GND) undercertain conditions. This happens when voltage on the bridge\npin (HB) is less than 40 V for a time greater than 100 /C0109s and\nthat is immediately followed by switching event that\npulls−up the HB pin above 150 V . This current can\npotentially last multiple switching cycle before itdiminishes. Furthermore, Impact Ionization current is notseen in systems where the bulk voltage is always below150 V i.e., HB node is never pulled above 150 V , forinstance, a 48 V to 12 V full −bridge power converter.\nFigure 36 below shows an example of Impact Ionization\ncurrent. This example shows a half −bridge converter\nrunning at 100 kHz frequency with 3 /C0109s on−time. It showsImpact Ionization current flowing in first three pulses during\nstartup and subsiding thereafter.\nDepending on the duration and magnitude of the Impact\nIonization current it can lead to thermal stress on the device\nwhich can potentially, in corner cases, cause a thermalfailure of NCP51530.\nFollowing are the safe conditions under which the Impact\nIonization current doesn’t occur:\n1. Systems where VHB < 150 V and VBOOT <\n170 V .OR\n2. Systems where VHB > 40 V before the start of\nswitchingOR\nNCP51530\nwww. onsemi.com\n233. Further, if the dv/dt of the VHB is kept under\n0.1 V/ns, then the Impact Ionization currentsubstantially reduces.\nMitigating Impact Ionization Current in Various\nTopologies\n•Flyback Converters and derivatives: Any topologies\nbased on flyback or derivatives (DCM/CCM Flyback,Active Clamp Flyback, and AHB Flyback) do not show\nany Impact Ionization current. This is because that\ntransformer in the flyback topology is connected to\ninput directly hence the VHB at t = 0 is at input voltage(> 40 V) satisfying the second conditioned mentioned\nabove.\nFigure 36. Impact Ionization Current in NCP51530. C1 is HB node at 50 V/div and C2 is Impact Ionization Current\nat 50 mA/div\n•Synchronous Boost Converter: Similar to flyback the\nVHB at t = 0 is at input voltage (> 40 V) so no Impact\nIonization current flows.\n•Phase Shifted Full −bridge: The HB pin can be\npotentially at less than 40 V when switching starts. This\ncan cause Impact Ionization current to flow duringstartup and in burst mode. This can be mitigated by\nadding parallel resistors (>1 Meg) across the FETs. This\nensures that the voltage on HB pin at t = 0 is greaterthan 40 V . This is shown in figure 2 below. R1, R2, R3\nand R4 ensure that the switch node voltage is at a\nvoltage greater than 40 V before the switching starts.\n•High V oltage Synchronous Buck Converter:\nSynchronous buck presents the worst case for theImpact Ionization current. The HB is at a voltage equal\nto output voltage always at t= 0. Hence at the startup or\nin the cases of burst mode we see Impact Ionization\ncurrent when the V out < 40 V . One potential solutioncan be pre −charging the output with VCC through a\ndiode and running the system in soft −switching from\nfirst pulse itself. However if the regulated V out is lessthan 40 V then there is a chance of Impact Ionization\ncurrent every burst cycle. But as explained earlier this\noccurs only in case of HV systems. When the bulkvoltage is less than 150 V no Impact Ionization current\nis seen.\nNCP51530\nwww. onsemi.com\n24\nFigure 37.
