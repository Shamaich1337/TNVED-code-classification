F | Page 24 of 29 APPLICATIONS  INFORMATION  \nPCB LAYOUT  \nThe ADuM1440 /ADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 / \nADuM1446 /ADuM1447  digital isolator s require no external \ninterface circuitry for the logic interfaces. Power supply \nbypassing  is strongly recommended at both input and \noutput supp ly pins : VDD1 and V DD2 (see Figure 29). Choose a \ncapacitor value between  0.01  µF and 0.1 µF . The total lead \nlength between both ends of the  capacitor and the input power \nsupply pin must  not exceed 20  mm.  \nUsing proper PCB design choices, t he \nADuM1440 /ADuM1441 / \nADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446 /ADuM1447  readily \nmeet s CISPR 22 Class A (and FCC Class A) emissions \nstandards, as well as the more stringent CISPR 22 Class B \n(and FCC Class B) standards in an unshielded environment. \nRefer  to the AN-1109 Application Note , Recommendations \nfor Control of Radiated Emissions with iCoupler Devices , for \nPCB -related EMI mitigation techniques, including board \nlayout and stack -up issues.   \n \nFigure 29. Recommended Printed Circuit Board Layout , QSOP  \n \nFigure 30. Recommended Printed Circuit Board Layout, SSOP  \nFor applications involving high common -mode transients, it \nis important to minimize board coupling across the isolation \nbarrier. Furthermore, design the  board layout so that any \ncoupling that does occur equally affects all pins on a given \ncomponent side. Failure to ensure this can cause voltage \ndifferentials between pins exceeding the absolute maximum \nratings of the device, thereby leading to latch -up or \npermanent damage.  \nPROPAGATION DELAY -RELATED PARAMETERS  \nThese product s are optimized for minimum power \nconsumpt ion by eliminating as many internal bias currents \nas possible. As a result,  the timing characteristics are more \nsensitive to operating voltage and  temperature than in \nstandard iCoupler products . Refer to Figure 21 through \nFigure 28 for the expected variation of these parameters.  \nPropagation delay is a parameter defined as  the time it \ntakes a logic signal to propagate through a component. The input -to-output propagation delay time for a high -to-low \ntransition can differ from the propagation delay time of a low -\nto-high transition.   \n \nFigure 31. Propa gation Delay Parameters  \nPulse width distortion is the maximum difference between \nthese two propagation delay values and an indication of \nhow accurately the timing of the input signal is preserved.  \nChannel -to-channel matching is the maximum amount of \ntime the propagation delay differs between channels within \na single \nADuM1440 /ADuM144 1/ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446\n/ ADuM1447  component.  \nPropagation delay skew is the maximum amount of time the \npropagation delay differs between multiple ADuM1440 / \nADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446 /ADuM1447  \ncomponents operating under the same conditions.  \nIn edge -based systems, it is critical to reject pulses that are \ntoo short to be hand led by the encode and decode circuits. \nThe \nADuM1440 /ADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446\n/ ADuM1447  implement a glitch filter to reject pulses less \nthan  the glitch filter operating threshold. This threshold \ndepends on the operating volt age, as shown in Figure 26. \nAny pulse shorter than the glitch filter does  not pass to the \noutput. When the refresh  circuit is enabled, pulses that \nmatch the glitch filter width have a small probability of \nbeing stretched until corrected by the next refresh cycle, or \nby the next valid data through that channel. To avoid issues \nwith pulse stretching, observe the minimum  pulse width \nrequirements listed i n the switching specifications.  \nDC CORRECTNESS  \nStandard Operating Mode  \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input \ncause narrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder using \nthe transformer. The decoder is bistable and is, therefore, \neither set or reset by the pulses, indicating input logic \ntransitions. When refresh and watchdog functions are \nenabled by pull ing EN 1 and EN 2 low, in the absence of logic \ntransitions at the input for more than ~140 µs, a peri odic \nset of refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state is  \nsent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If  the decoder \nreceives no internal pulses of more than approximately  200 µs, \nthe input side is assumed unpowered or nonfunctional, in \nwhich ca se, the isolator watchdog circuit forces the output \nto a default state. The default state is either high as in the \nADuM1440 , ADuM1441 , and ADuM1442  versions, or low as in \nthe ADuM1445 , ADuM1446 , and ADuM1447  versions.  \n \nVDD1\nGND 1\nVIA\nVIB\nVIC/VOC\nVID/VOD\nEN1\nGND1VDD2\nGND2\nVOA\nVOB\nVOC/VIC\nVOD/VID\nEN2\nGND2\n11845-018\nVDD1\nGND 1\nVIA\nVIB\nVIC/VOC\nVID/VOD\nNC/CTRL 1\nEN1\nNC\nGND 1VDD2\nGND2\nVOA\nVOB\nVOC/VIC\nVOD/VID\nCTRL 2\nNC/EN2\nNC\nGND2\n11845-126\nINPUT(VIx)\nOUTPUT(VOx)tPLH tPHL\n50%50%\n11845-019\nData Sheet  ADuM1440/ADuM1441/ADuM1442/ADuM1445/\nADuM1446/ADuM1447  \n \nRev. F | Page 25 of 29 Low Power Operating Mode  \nThe ADuM1440 /ADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 / \nADuM1446 /ADuM1447  allow the refresh and watchdog \nfunctions to be disabled by pulling EN 1 and EN 2 to logic high \nfor the lowest power consumption. These control pins must be \nset to  the same value on ea ch side of the component for proper \noperation.  \nIn this mode , the current consum ption of the chip drops to \nthe microamp  range.  However , be careful when using this \nmode because dc  correctness is no longer guaranteed  at \nstartup . For example , if the following sequence of events \noccurs : \n1. Power is applied to  Side 1  \n2. A high level is asserted on the VIA input   \n3. Power is applied to Side 2  \nThe high on V IA is not automatically transferred to the S ide \n2 V OA, and there can be a level mismatch that is not correcte d \nuntil a tra nsition occurs at V IA. After power is stable on each \nside  and a transition occurs  on the input of the channel , that \nchannel ’s input  and output state  is correctly matched.  This  \ncontingency  can be addressed in several ways, such as \nsending dummy data, or toggling refresh  on for a short period  \nto force synchronization after turn on.  \nRecommended Input Voltage for Low Power \nOperation  \nThe ADuM1440 /ADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 / \nADuM1446 /ADuM1447  implement Schmitt trigger input \nbuffers s o that the devices  operate cleanly in low data rate \nor noisy environments.  Schmit t triggers allow a small \namount of sho ot through current when their input voltage \nis not approximate  to either V DDx or GND x levels . This is \nbecause the two transistors are both slightly on when input \nvoltages are in the middle of the supply  range. For many digital \ndevices, this leakage is not a large p ortion  of the total supply \ncurrent and may not be noticed ; however , i n the ultralow \npower  ADuM1440 /ADuM1441 /ADuM1442 / \nADuM1445 /ADuM1446 /ADuM1447 , this leakage can be \nlarger than t he total operating current of th e device and \ncannot be ignored.  \nTo achieve optimum power consumption with the \nADuM1440 / \nADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446 / \nADuM144 7, always drive the inputs as near  to V DDx or GND x \nlevels  as possible. Figure 19 and Figure 20 illustrate the \nshoot through leakage of an input ; therefore,  whe reas  the \nlogic thresholds  of the input are standard CMOS levels, \noptimum power performance is achieved  when the input \nlogic lev els are driven within 0.5  V of either V DDx or GND x \nlevels . \nMAGNETIC FIELD IMMUNITY  \nThe magnetic field immunity of the ADuM1440 /ADuM1441 / \nADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446 /ADuM1447  is \ndetermined by the changing magnetic field, which induces a \nvoltage in the receiving coil of the transformer  large enough to either falsely set or reset the decoder. The following  \nanalysis defines the conditions under which this can occur. \nThe 3.3 V operating condition of the \nADuM1440 /ADuM1441 /ADuM1442 / \nADuM1445 /ADuM1446 /ADuM1447  is examined because it \nrepresents the most typical  mode of operation.  \nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude \ngreater than 1.0  V . The decoder has a sensing threshold at \nabout 0.5 V , thus establishing a 0.5 V margin in which \ninduced voltages can be tolerated. The voltage induced \nacross the receiving coil is giv en by  \nV = (−dβ/dt ) ∑ π  rn2; n = 1, 2, … , N \nwhere:  \nβ is magnetic flux density (gauss).  \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm).  \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil.  \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM1440 / \nADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446 /ADuM1447  \nand an imposed requirement that the induced voltage be, at \nmost , 50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum \nallowable magnetic field at a given frequency can be \ncalculated. The result is shown in Figure 32. \n \nFigure 32. Maximum Allowable  External Magnetic Flux Density  \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum allowable magnetic field of 0.5 kgauss induces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of \nthe sensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output \ntransition. Similarly, if such an event occurred during a \ntransmitted pulse (and was of the worst -case polarity), it \nwould redu ce the received  pulse from >1.0  V to 0.75  V, still \nwell above the 0.5 V sensing threshold of the decoder.  \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to \nspecific  current magnitudes at given distances from the \nADuM1440 / \nADuM1441 /ADuM144 2/ADuM1445 /ADuM1446 /ADuM1447  \ntransformers. Figure 33 shows these allowable current \nmagnitudes  as a function of frequency for selected distances. \nAs shown, the \nADuM1440 /ADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446\n/ ADuM1447  are extremely immune and can be affected \n1000\n1k 100M 10kMAXIMUMALLOWABLEMAGNETIC FLUX(kgauss)\n100k 1M 10M\nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n11845-020\nADuM1440/ADuM 1441/ADuM1442/ADuM1445/\nADuM1446/ADuM1447  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Take c are in the layout of such \ntraces to avoid this possibility.  \nPOWER CONSUMPTION  \nThe supply current at a given channel of the ADuM1440 / \nADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446 /ADuM1447  \nisolator is a function o f the supply voltage, the data rate of \nthe channel, and the output load of the channel.  \nFor each input channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDI = I DDI (Q) f ≤ 0.5 fr \nIDDI = IDDI (D)  × (2 f − fr) + IDDI (Q) f > 0.5 fr \nFor each output channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDO = I DDO (Q) f ≤ 0.5 fr \nIDDO = (IDDO (D) + (0.5 × 10−3) × CL × V DDO) × (2 f − f r) + IDDO (Q) \n f > 0.5 fr \nwhere:  \nIDDI (D) , IDDO (D)  are the input and output dynamic supply \ncurrents per channel (mA/Mbps).  \nIDDI (Q) , IDDO (Q)  are the specified input and output quiescent  \nsupply currents (mA).  \nf is the input logic signal frequency (MHz); it is half the \ninput data rate, expressed in units of Mbps.  \nfr is the input stage refresh rate (Mbps).  \nCL is the output load capacitance (pF).  \nVDDO is the output supply voltage (V).  \nTo calculate the total V DD1 and V DD2 supply current, the \nsupply currents for each input and output channel corresponding to V DD1 and V DD2 are calculated and totaled. \nFigure 11 through Figure 18 show per  channel supply \ncurrents as a function of data rate for an unloaded output \ncondition . \n \n \nThe ADuM1440 /ADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 / \nADuM1446 /ADuM1447  devices are intended to operate at \nan ultra low current . This is achieved by operating  the part \nat a low average data rate , either by bursting data at high \nspeed at a low duty factor or by running low b it rates. If \ndata  is burst at high data rates, the part sit s quiescent for \nthe majority of the time, at low data rates, the power \nconsumption approaches the quiescent power \nconsumption. Table 25 shows the typical current for an \ninput and output channel pair as well as the total power \ndissipated for that channel. Th e total  power is summed \nacross both sides of the device, so the power is being drawn \nfrom two diffe rent supplies. However,  it shows how the \npower depends on the V DD values and the state of the \nrefresh.  \nTable 25.

In addition to t he testing performed by the \nregulatory agencies, Analog Devices c arries out an extensive \nset of evaluations to determine the lifetime of the insulation \nstructure within the ADuM1440 / \nADuM1441 /ADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446 /ADuM1447 . \nAnalo g Devices performs accelerated life testing using voltage \nlevels  higher than the rated continuous working voltage. \nAcceleration factors for several operating conditions are \ndetermined. These factors allow calculation of the time to \nfailure at the actual wo rking voltage. The values shown  in \nTable 20 summarize the peak voltage for 50 years of service \nlife for a bipolar ac operating condition and the maximum \nCSA approved working voltages. In many cases, the \napproved working voltage is high er than the 50-year \nservice life voltage. Operation at these high working \nvoltages can lead to shortened insulation life , in some cases.  \n1k 100M 10kMAXIMUMALLOWABLECURR ENT(kA)\n100k 1M 10M\nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENC Y (Hz)DISTANCE = 5mm\nDISTANCE = 100mm\nDISTANCE = 1m1000\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n11845-021\nData Sheet  ADuM1440/ADuM1441/ADuM1442/ADuM1445/\nADuM1446/ADuM1447  \n \nRev. F | Page 27 of 29 The insulation lifetime of the ADuM1440 /ADuM1441 / \nADuM1442 /ADuM1445 /ADuM1446 /ADuM1447  depends on \nthe voltage waveform type imposed across the isolation \nbarrier. The iCoupler insulation structure degrades at \ndifferent rates depending on whether th e waveform is \nbipolar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 34, Figure 35, and \nFigure 36 illustrate these different isolation voltage \nwaveforms.  \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. The \ngoal of a 50 -year operating lifetime under the ac bipolar \ncondition determines the Analog Devices recommended \nmaximum wo rking voltage.  \nIn the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the \ninsulation  is significantly lower.  This allows operation at \nhigher working voltages while still achieving a 50 -year \nservice life. The working voltages listed  in Table 20 can be \napplied while maintaining the 50 -year minimum lifetime \nprovided the voltage conforms to either the unipolar ac or dc \nvoltage case. Treat a ny cross -insulation  voltage waveform that \ndoes  not conform to Figure 35 or Figure 36 as a bipolar ac \nwaveform, and limit its peak voltage to the 50 -year lifetime \nvoltage value listed in Table 20.  Note that the voltage presented in Figure 35 is shown as \nsinusoidal for illustration purposes only. It is meant to \nrepresent any voltage waveform varying between 0 V and \nsome limiting value. The limiting value can be positive or \nnegativ e, but the voltage cannot cross 0 V .  \n \nFigure 34. Bipolar AC Waveform  \n \nFigure 35. Unipolar AC Waveform  \n \nFigure 36.
