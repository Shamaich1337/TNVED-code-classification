This procedure \ncan take up to 20 ms to complete, during which time the device may not respond to PMBus commands. \nInitialization takes place the first time power is applied to the VCC pin and does not repeat unless the device \nis power cycled. Pin configuration is loaded during this time. Until initialization is complete, all pins remain high \nimpedance, except for the AVR_RDY and BVR_RDY pins which are pulled low by default.\nOnce initialization is complete, the device waits for an enable condition specified by the ON_OFF_CONFIG \ncommand to begin power conversion. By default the device is configured to wait for the AVR_EN pin to be set \nhigh to enable channel A, and the BVR_EN pin to be set high to enable channel B. Once an enable condition is \nreceived, TPS536C7B1 checks that the powerstage input supply (VIN_CSNIN pin) is above the VIN_ON  value, \nand the powerstage driver is fully powered (e.g. that no TAO_LOW condition exists). This takes approximately \n750 μ s (up to 1.0 ms) to complete before the first PWM pulses are output by the controller. This process repeats \neach time power conversion is enabled for any reason, including enable cycling or fault shutdown.\n+3.3 V Power \nApplied to VCC\nCheck for faults, UVLO \nand Powerstages ready, \nbegin enable sequence\nUp to 1 msContinue\nWaiting\nPower \nConversion \nContinuesInitialize\nNVM and Trim bits, \nPinstrap Detection\nUp to 20 msBegin accepting \nPMBus commands.\nWait for Enable \nCondition per \nON_OFF_CONFIG, \nor hiccup/hysteresis \nfault recovery \nPower Conversion\nOutput voltage begins \nrising to VBOOT,\nVR_RDY releasesFault\nNot \nReady\nYet \nFault Condition\nFigure 7-1. Initialization process\n7.3.2 Boot voltage configuration (VBOOT)\nBy default, the boot voltage for channel A is given by pin-detection on the VBOOT_CHA pin. Alternatively, \nconfigure the device to use a value stored in non-volatile memory (NVM) for VOUT_COMMAND  using \nthe PIN_DETECT_OVERRIDE  command. See Pin-strap Detection and PIN_DETECT_OVERRIDE  for more \ninformation. The boot voltage for Channel B is given by the value stored in non-volatile memory for \nVOUT_COMMAND  always. Whenever power conversion is enabled, each channel boots to its VBOOT value, \nregardless of whether the output voltage was changed after the last boot-up.\nUse the VOUT_COMMAND  PMBus command to change the output voltage on-the-fly. This is one \nimplementation of adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) or dynamic VID (DVID). Output voltage transitions occur at \nthe value slew rate specified by the VOUT_TRANSITION_RATE  command.\n7.3.3 Power Sequencing\nThere are no strict supply sequencing requirements for TPS536C7B1. VIN_CSNIN and CSP, the powerstage 5-\nV supply, and the controller VCC (3.3-V) may be safely powered up independently of each other. TI recommends \nthat power conversion be commanded on only after all supplies are established and have had time to settle. \nRefer to Power Supply Recommendations  for more detailed information.TPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n34 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.4 Pin connections and bevahior\n7.4.1 Supplies: VCC and VREF\nThe VCC pin supplies all analog and digital circuits internal to the device. Connect a 3.3-V supply voltage, and \nlocal ceramic bypass capacitor with a minimum effective capacitance of 1.0 µF.\nThe VREF pin is the output of an internal LDO with a nominal voltage of 1.5 V. The VREF voltage provides a \ncommon-mode voltage for the power stage IOUT pins, as well as internal analog circuits. Bypass the VREF pin \nlocal to the controller, with a ceramic bypass capacitor with a minimum effective capacitance of 1.0 µF. Connect \nVREF to the REFIN pins of the power stages.\n7.4.2 Differential remote sensing and output voltage scaling: AVSP/AVSN, BVSP/BVSN\nA differential remote sense amplifier enables the controller to compensate for I×R drop due to PCB copper, in \nhigh current applications. Connect the AVSP/BVSP and AVSN/BVSN pins respectively to the output voltage at \nthe load point, through the network described in Figure 7-2 . A connection to the output voltage, local to the \npower stages, shown by R LCL_P  and R LCL_N , maintains closed loop operation even if the load is uninstalled, or \nthe remote sense connection is opened. Route the differential remote sense lines as a tightly-coupled differential \npair, and maintain a wide clearance to any fast switching nets, such as power stage switch nodes or power \ninput voltage. Optionally, use a small filtering capacitor, shown as C FILT, at the controller side to improve noise \nimmunity.\nThe output voltage set-point is generated by an internal precision reference DAC. The reference DAC is capable \nof producing reference voltages up to 1.87 V. For output voltage set-points below 1.87 V, no scaling (internal or \nexternal) is required, and the sensed output voltage is compared directly to the reference voltage.\nFor output voltage set-points between 1.87 V and 3.74 V, the controller applies internal scaling of the remote \nsense amplifier, and no external sense divider is needed. Set the VOUT_MAX  command greater than 1.87 V to \nenable this internal scaling. For output voltage set-points greater than 3.74 V, apply an external sense divider \nwith R RMT_P  = R DIV = 500 Ω, and set the VOUT_SCALE_LOOP  command to 0.5 V/V. This enables output \nvoltage set-points up to 5.5 V. The overvoltage/undervoltage thresholds are referenced to the VSP/VSN pins \nonly and need to be scaled appropriately for applications with an external resistor divider. Refer to Table 7-1  for \nmore information.\nTPS536C7B1 performs an open/short detection on the AVSP/AVSN and BVSP/BVSN pins at initialization to \ndetermine if the voltage sense lines are open. The controller flags a fault condition and does not attempt to boot \nif an open sense line is detected. Ground the VSP/VSN lines for unused channels to prevent false-triggering, \nin applications which do not make use of both channels. As such, the local sense resistor connection may be \nomitted, but is still recommended for debug and system bode plot measurement.\nVOUT_COMMAND\nVOUT_SCALE_LOOPVoltage\nReference\n DAC×RRMT_P\nRRMT_NRDIVVOUT Local\nCFILT\nRLCL_NRLCL_P\nGND LocalAVSN/BVSNAVSP/BVSP\nVOUT+\nVOUT-Remote Sense and \nDroop Amplifier\nVDACTo Control LoopVDROOP\nVOUT_MAX\nFigure 7-2.

Kelvin connect \nthese pins to the external sense element R SENSE  as shown in Figure 7-3 , and route back to the controller as \na tightly coupled differential pair. R SENSE  may be a precision current sense shunt resistor or an input inductor \nDCR, with an associated temperature compensation network. TI recommends adding common-mode filtering \ncapacitors, shown as C CMFILT , and a differential-mode filtering capacitor C DMFILT  to reduce measurement noise. \nA typical value for these capacitors is 1.0 µF.\nFor designs that do not use input current sensing, connect VIN_CSNIN and CSPIN together, and to the \ninput voltage supply. The controller requires input voltage sense for proper on-time generation. Ensure the \nVIN_CSNIN and CSPIN pins remain within ± 300 mV due to internal ESD protection structures on these pins.\nVIN_CSNINTPS536xx\nCSPINRSENSE\nPVINTo Power stage VIN\nPins/pads\n+±To On-Time \nGenerators\nAnalog Front-End Gain\n20 to 100       ADC\n800mV \nMax\x08\nDigital Gain\nGIINMAX  = 0 to 255READ_IIN\nGINSHUNT\nIIN Offset\nIIN_OFS = -8 A to +7.9375ACCMFILTCDMFILT\nFigure 7-3.

Connect a resistor divider to ADDR_CONFIG as shown in Figure 7-4 . Refer to Table 7-2  to \nselect resistor values. The table shows series E96 value equivalents. Use 1% tolerance resistors for all values. \nAfter pin detection completes, the decoded results are loaded into the SLAVE_ADDRESS  and PHASE_CONFIG \ncommands. Phase firing order is automatically selected by pin detection. Disable phase number detection on the \nADDR_CONFIG pin detection using PIN_DETECT_OVERRIDE , to use a non-default firing order.\nThe VBOOT_CHA pin provides resistor pin detection for the channel A boot voltage. The channel B boot \nvoltage does not have pin detection and must be programmed in non-volatile memory. Connect a resistor divider \nto VBOOT_CHA as shown in Figure 7-4 . The table shows series E96 value equivalents. Use 1% tolerance \nresistors for all values. After pin detection completes, the decoded result is loaded into the VOUT_COMMAND \ncommand for PAGE 0.\nFor each each pin detection, during boot-up the device performs two measurements to determine an 8 bit binary \nnumber, referred to as the pinstrap decode . The 3 LSB bits are determined by shorting the high-side resistor \nand measuring the low-side resistor value. The 5 MSB bits are determined by measuring the pin voltage. The \ndecoded value is then mapped to the configuration values shown in the tables below.\nValues not given by ADDR_CONFIG pinstrap decoding  and VBOOT_CHA pinstrap decoding  can still be \nachieved using the PIN_DETECT_OVERRIDE  command. This command instructs the device at power-up, \nwhether to follow the values given by pin detection, or use values stored in non-volatile memory to populate \nthe SLAVE_ADDRESS , PHASE_CONFIG  and VOUT_COMMAND  commands. Each parameter has a separate \ncontrol, so it is possible, for example, to pin detect PMBus address, while taking phase configuration from NVM.\nRHAVREF\nRLAADDR_CONFIGTPS536xx\nRHB\nRLBVBOOT_CHA\nFigure 7-4.

By default only the AVR_EN (active high) pin enables channel A, and only the BVR_EN pin (active \nhigh) enables channel B. This command can program the controller ignore the VR_EN pins and require the \nOPERATION  command to be sent to enable power conversion, or even require a combination of the two.\nWhen enabled, first the controller waits for a delay time given by TON_DELAY , then ramps the output voltage at \na controlled slew rate SR BOOT . The device requires 750 μs typically (up to 1.0 ms), to begin ramping the output \nvoltage, after being enabled. Turn-on delay added by the TON_DELAY  is in addition to this delay.\nThe ON_OFF_CONFIG  command also controls the turn-off behavior. When configured for immediate-off , the \ncontroller immediately tri-states all PWM pins assigned to that channel and stops transferring power immediately. \nWhen configured for soft-off  the controller first waits for the TOFF_DELAY  time, then actively ramps down the \noutput voltage at a controlled slew rate.\nVR_EN\nVOUT\nTON_DELAYSR BOOT\nDecay based \non load currenttEN_INIT\nFigure 7-5.

These \npins are open drain structures, and require external pull-up resistors. During boot-up, the VR_RDY pins are \nreleased when the internal reference DAC reaches the boot voltage. Any condition which causes the channel to \nstop converting power, causes its VR_RDY pin to pull low. This includes any fault protection-related shutdown, or \nthe channel simply being disabled. The VR_RDY pins do not assert to alert the host to any warning conditions or \nfaults configured to be ignored.\n7.4.7 Catastrophic fault alert: VR_FAULT#\nThe VR_FAULT# pin is an open drain output which alerts the system to potentially catastrophic power supply \nfaults. The VR_FAULT# pin is an open drain structure. Connect an external pull-up resistor to this pin.\nOnly the most critical fault conditions assert the VR_FAULT# pin. Fault responses configured to be ignored do \nnot assert the VR_FAULT# pin. The VR_FAULT_CONFIG  PMBus command provides some options to control \nwhich fault conditions cause this pin to assert.\nFault conditions which assert the VR_FAULT# pin include:\n•Over-voltage fault (including pre-bias OVP, fixed OVP, and tracking OVP)\n•Powerstage fault (TAO_HIGH)\n•Input overcurrent fault\n•Output overcurrent fault (configurable)\n•Over-temperature fault (configurable)\n•Faults from channel A only, or channel A+B (configurable)\n7.4.8 Output voltage reset: RESET#\nBy default, pin 19 functions as the channel B enable pin, BVR_EN. Use the command to assign pin 19 as a \nhardware voltage reset signal, RESET#, as needed. When pin 19 is not assigned as BVR_EN, the AVR_EN pin \nbecomes a shared enable pin for both channels. RESET# is an active-low signal. Connect an external pull-up to \nthis pin to make its default state high (e.g. not in reset).\nAsserting the RESET# pin low during regulation causes the output voltage of both channels to slew back to their \nrespective V BOOT  values, at the slew rate defined by . While RESET# is asserted low, new output voltage targets \nfrom PMBus are ignored. Figure 7-7  describes the behavior of the RESET# pin.\nVR_EN\nVBOOT\nSR BOOTSR VOTR SR VOTRVNEW\nVBOOT VBOOT\nNew target \nfrom PMBusReset\nAfter\nvoltage \nsettledReset during\nVoltage slewRESET#\nNew target \nfrom PMBus\nFigure 7-7.

When there is no SYNC pin assigned, \nconfigure the SYNC_CONFIG  to operate based on internal timing, in order to maintain an accurate switching \nfrequency over the full range of operation. Any external clock applied to must have a 50% duty cycle, \nand the FREQUENCY_SWITCH  command must still be programmed as close as possible to the desired \nswitching frequency after any scaling. The input on the SYNC pin must be ±50 kHz from the configured \nFREQUENCY_SWITCH  value.\nAn internal phase-locked loop (PLL) adjusting the on-time of each phase enables edge synchronization. During \nsteady-state operation, when synchronization is used, the PWM pin assigned to order 0 is synchronized to \na clock on the SYNC pin. The DCAP+ control topology is inherently a variable frequency scheme. During \nload transients, the pulse frequency of each channel modulates to maintain voltage regulation. Load transients \ncause the PLL to lose phase lock, and slowly return to phase lock based on the PLL loop bandwidth. The \nPLL bandwidth is much slower than the voltage regulation loop, and it can take many cycles for the PLL to \nre-lock following a transient event. Figure 7-8  illustrates the DCAP+ response to a load transient using edge \nsynchronization.\nIOUT\nCLK_ON\nPWM1\nPWM2SYNC\nPLL\nLockedPLL\nLockedPLL\nNot\nLockedPLL\nNot\nLockedPLL\nNot\nLockedPLL\nLockedPhase delay of \nSYNC to PWM1PLL corrects phase error \nbetween PWM1 and SYNC\nFigure 7-8. Synchronization behavior (2 phase example, no phase shift)\nThe SYNC_CONFIG  command configures various options related to synchronization. These include: enable/\ndisable of the PLL, sync direction (clock master or clock slave), input clock division ratio, phase shift, and \ngain/scalar terms to increase/decrease the PLL loop bandwidth.

Two clock slaves driven externally\n7.4.10 Smart power stage connections: PWM, CSP and TSEN\nInterface the controller to TI smart power stage devices, as shown in Figure 7-11 .\nConnect the PWM pins of the controller to the PWM pins of the power stage devices. The PWM pins are \nthree-state logic outputs of the controller. A PWM pin being logic-high commands the power stage device to turn \nits high-side FET on, and its low-side FET off. A PWM pin being logic-low commands the power stage device to \nturn its low-side FET on and its high-side FET off. TI power stage devices provide a weak drive on their PWM \npins, causing them to float to a mid-level value when the controller stops driving them. During enable, or dynamic \nphase addition, the controller starts phases switching with a transition from tri-state to high. Similarly, during \ndisable or dynamic phase shedding, the controller disables phases with a transition from low-to-tri-state. Float \nunused PWM pins on the controller.\nConnect the IOUT pins of the powerstage devices to the CSP pins of the controller. Connect the VREF pin \nof the controller to the REFIN pins of the powerstage devices. A local bypass capacitor C VREF, is required \nfor the controller VREF pin. Optionally, add a local VREF bypass capacitor at the powerstage devices. VREF \nprovides common-mode voltage for the IOUT signal, which is a voltage representing the output current of each \npowerstage with a nominal gain of 5 mV/A. Float unused CSP pins on the controller.\nConnect the TAO/FAULT pins of all powerstages within a channel to each other, and to the corresponding TSEN \npin of the controller. For example, tie all TAO/FAULT pins of powerstages used on channel A together and to \nthe controller ATSEN pin. TI recommends adding a 2200 pF capacitor to the TSEN pins at the controller to \nreduce temperature measurement noise. TI recommends keeping a place holder for a 1000 pF capacitor at \nthe powerstage side. Refer to the individual powerstage datasheet for more detailed recommendations. During \nnormal operation, the TSEN pins provide a voltage signal proportional to the temperature of the warmest \npowerstage device according to Equation 3  . During a UVLO condition, the powerstages pull the shared TAO line \nlow to inform the controller they are not able to accept PWM input. When powerstages detect a fault condition \ninternally, they pull the shared TAO pin high to inform the controller a fault condition has occurred. If channel B is \nnot used, float the BTSEN pin.\nREAD_TEMPERATURE_1 =VTSEN −600mV\n8mV°C (3)TPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n44 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nAPWM1TPS536xx CSD9xxx\nPWM\nVREFACSP1 IOUT\nREFINTAO/FAULT\nCSD9xxx\nPWM\nIOUT\nREFINTAO/FAULT\nCSD9xxx\nPWM\nIOUT\nREFINTAO/FAULTChannel A\nPhase 1\n...\nChannel A\nPhase N\nChannel B\nPhase 1ATSENAPWMx\nACSPx\nBPWMx\nBCSPx\nBTSEN\nto other channel \nB power stagesCVREF\nCATSEN\nCBTSENControllerDNP\nDNP\nDNPFigure 7-11.

If commanded higher or lower than these limits, the output \nvoltage transitions to these limits and stops.\nThe soft-start and soft-off slew rates are calculated using the current output voltage target and TON_RISE  and \nTOFF_FALL  command values. All output voltage transitions which occur during normal power conversion follow \nthe slew rate defined by VOUT_TRANSITION_RATE .\nThe VOUT_SCALE_LOOP  parameter must be set properly when an external output voltage divider is being \nused.

Output voltage control conceptual view\nTPS536C7B1 provides several options to fine-tune the controller response to high speed output voltage \ntransitions. For example, large output voltage steps upward cause an inrush current, required to charge the \noutput capacitors for that channel. This inrush current combined with the DC load line setting make the output \nvoltage appear to move more slowly than the commanded slew rate. Use the DVID_CONFIG  command to \nconfigure dynamic  loadlines and offsets which apply only during output voltage transitions. Typically, set the DC \nand AC load lines for upward moving transitions to a value equal or lower than the nominal. Similarly, typically, \nset the DC and AC loadlines to a value larger than the nominal value for downward moving transitions.

Refer to Section 7.4.4 , for \nmore information about enabling NVM phase configuration settings. Refer to the Technical Reference Manual  for \na register map of the PHASE_CONFIG  command. Each PWM pin has 4 available settings:\n•ENABLE:  Controls whether the phase is active or remains at tristate always.\n•PAGE:  Assigns each phase to channel A or channel B.

The PHASE \nassignment is not backed by non-volatile memory, and each phase is assigned a derived PHASE setting at \npower-on.\n•ORDER:  Controls the order in which phases are fired with respect to each other. Figure 7-14  and Figure \n7-15 illustrate the effect of different ordering assignments.

This increases the total converter efficiency by \nreducing unnecessary switching losses when the output current is low enough to be supported by a fewer \nnumber of phases, than are available in hardware. Use the PHASE_SHED_CONFIG  command to configure \nthe phase adding/shedding thresholds. Refer to the Technical Reference Manual  for a full listing of available \nthresholds.\nSet the DPS_EN bit to 0b to disable phase shedding operation. The MIN_PH setting determines the minimum \nnumber of phases which are active during light-load operation.\nPhase adding is detected based on the summed peak current of all phases in the analog domain. Phase \nshedding is detected based on average current telemetry, with a forced delay of 120 μs. The phase add \nthresholds are not affected by current measurement calibration, but the phase shed thresholds are.\nEach phase has 3 settings available:\n•Phase add threshold (PH_ADDx)  selects the nominal phase adding threshold. Set this value approximately \nequal to the peak efficiency point per phase to optimize overall converter efficiency.\n•Phase add hysteresis (DPA_HYSTx)  selects the phase add threshold hsyteresis. Nominally set this value to \none-half the value of the ripple current on the I SUM current for that number of phases.\n•Phase drop hysteresis (DPS_HYST)  selects the phase drop hysteresis (per-phase average current). There \nis one setting per channel.\nThe phase add/drop thresholds can be calculated according to the equations below.

Normal phases \ncan use larger inductance values to enable converter operation at lower switching frequency, as well as \nreduce inductor core loss.\n•Turbo phases  carry the AC load transient current and are not intended to remain operational always. \nUselower inductance values for turbo phases to enable them to ramp up their phase current quickly as \nthey turn on during transient events. Assign a higher current sharing ratio to turbo phases using the \nISHARE_CONFIG  command. Turbo phases are activated whenever USR2 is triggered, or whenever the \nconverter output current exceeds their respective phase adding threshold. Turbo phases are always added \nlast, and multiple turbo phases are added at the same time, regardless of their ordering assignment.\nTurbo mode is only applicable to systems which use dynamic phase shedding. This feature is optional, and only \nrecommended in cases where the system provides enough margin for the turbo phase power stages to operate \nwithin their safe operating area. The per-phase current report is not correct in turbo mode.\nUse the PHASE_CONFIG  command to assign phases as being either normal phases or turbo phases.\nExample: 7 phases with 2 turbo phases\n•Use the PHASE_CONFIG  command to assign phase order 3 and 6 as turbo phases. Assign turbo phases \nout-of-phase with each other to avoid increasing the converter output ripple by a large amount due to loss of \ninterleaving benefits.\n•Use the ISHARE_CONFIG  command to assign the "turbo gain" ratio as 2.0. This means the turbo phases will \ncarry 2.0x the current of normal phases when turned on. Ensure that the turbo phase power stages are still \noperated within their safe operating area at worst case.\n•Nominally, assign the turbo phases an inductance value proportionally lower compared to normal phases. \nIn this case, normal phases use 150 nH inductance, and turbo phases use 75 nH. Without turbo phase, all \nnormal phases would require 120nH.\n•Use the PHASE_CONFIG  command to set the dynamic phase adding thresholds for 5-6 phases and 6-7 \nphases high enough that they do not add during steady state current operation.\n•Use the FREQUENCY_SWITCH  command to reduce the switching frequency, to reduce switching loss.\n•As shown in Figure 7-16  and Figure 7-17 , the design still meets the transient requirement. The efficiency \nimprovement is approximately 0.3-0.5%.\nFigure 7-16. Load step with Turbo Mode\n Figure 7-17.

This \nfeature is also referred to as the DC load line (DCLL) for the control loop. Use a non-zero DC load line to reduce \noutput voltage set-point as a function of the load current, with a controlled slope. This feature is optional. Set the \nDC load line to 0.0 mΩ in applications which do not use a load line.\nThe DC load line provides two main benefits:\n•Reducing the output voltage set-point, reduces the power consumption of the system, when the load current \nis high.\n•Adaptive voltage positioning increases the allowable undershoot and overshoot during load transient events. \nFigure 7-18  and Figure 7-19  compare example output voltage specifications for systems with zero load line \nand non-zero load line. The nominal setting for the output voltage is chosen to be higher, to allow the entire \ntransient window as margin for transient overshoot and undershoot.\nVMAX(AC)\nVMIN(AC)û\x03VUNDER(SPEC)û\x03VOVER(SPEC)\nVMARG(UNDER)VMARG(OVER)ILOAD\nFigure 7-18.

Neglecting the output voltage information and \nintegration, the V COMP  signal is a scaled version of I SUM. A compensating ramp signal, V RAMP , has a slope \nproportional to the number of phases, and switching frequency setting. When the V RAMP  and V COMP  signals \nintersect, the controller fires a new pulse.\nPhase management logic distributes new pulses to the next phase in the firing order sequence. Each phase is \nassigned a firing order, at which pulses are passed to that phase. A separate, slower loop adjusts the on-times \nfor each phase based on the output voltage setpoint, switching frequency setting, and current balance error.www.ti.comTPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 57\nCLK_ONVRAMP\nPWM1VCOMP\n(includes I SUM) VCORE\nTimeISUM\nPWM2\nPWM3\nPWM4Figure 7-20.

Transient response tuning is \naccomplished by changing the parameters which generate the V COMP  signal. These parameters are accessible \nusing the COMPENSATION_CONFIG  command. Refer to the Technical Reference Manual  for a register map of \nthis command.\nThe V COMP  signal is generated by the sum of three signal paths. Finally the V COMP  signal is scaled by the AC \ngain parameter, K AC.\n•Proportional path:  An error amplifier subtracts the sensed output voltage from the output voltage target, set \nby V DAC. The gain of the proportional path is set by the AC load line (ACLL). Reducing the value of the AC \nload line increases the proportional path gain, which gives faster transient response. Setting the AC load line \nto a very low value can lead to low phase margin. The minimum recommended ACLL value is 0.125 m ohm.\n•Integral path:  The difference between the sensed output voltage and the output voltage target, V DAC, is \ncompared to the ideal droop (I SUM × DCLL) value to create an error voltage, V ERR. An integrator adjusts \nthe setpoint of V COMP , to drive the output voltage error to zero. Integration provides high DC gain, giving \nthe power supply excellent output regulation and DC load line performance. The programmable integration \ntime constant, τ INT changes the settling time of of the output voltage folliowing a transient. Increasing the \nintegration time constant improves phase margin. The programmable integration path gain, K INT, sets the \ngain of the integral path.\n•Current feedback:  The summed phase current, I SUM, with a nominal gain of 5 mV/A, is used directly to \ngenerate V COMP , as well as in the integral path to set the DC load line. The gain of this path is not affected by \nthe IOUT_CAL_GAIN  or IOUT_CAL_OFFSET  calibration commands.\n+1/ACLL\nKDIV KINT -KAC\nISUMVRAMP\nVVSP - VVSNVDAC\nISUMWINT+\n+\ní \x08+\n+\nVCOMPError AmplifierProportional Path\nIntegral Path\nCurrent FeedbackVERR\n5P\x9f\x03CLK_ONLoop \nComparator\nVDROOPN\n ± \nDCLL\x08\nFigure 7-22.

PWM on-times are adjusted very slowly compared to off-times, so the DCAP+ \nmodulator behaves similar to a constant-on-time architecture.\nUse the FREQUENCY_SWITCH  command to set the nominal per-phase switching frequency.\ntON=VDAC + KISHARE ×IL −IAVG\nVIN× FREQUENCY_SWITCH+ ΔPLL_CLF (34)\nwhere\n•tON is the on-time for the phase in seconds\n•VDAC is the output voltage set-point in volts\n•FREQUENCY_SWITCH is the commanded switching frequency in Hz\n•VIN is the sensed input voltage from the VIN_CSNIN pin\n•KISHARE  is the gain of the current share loop\n•IL is the current carried by the phase\n•IAVG is the average phase current for all phases\n•ΔPLL_CLF is the on-time adjustment from the closed loop frequency correction circuit\nCurrent sharing is implemented by adapting the on-time for each phase, according to the difference between its \nown phase current I L, and the average of all phase currents I AVG. When the phase current for any one phase \nis greater than the average of all phase currents, the on-time of that phase is reduced accordingly. Similarly, if \nthe phase current of any one phase is less than the average of all phase currents, the on-time of that phase is \nincreased.\nThe on-time is also proportional to the sensed input voltage, which provides the controller with inherent input \nvoltage feed-forward.\nFurthermore, a frequency control loop adjusts the on-times for each phase to drive the actual switching \nfrequency equal to the FREQUENCY_SWITCH  setting. An internal clock counts the number of observed pulses \nover a set interval, and compares the result to the calculated ideal number. If too many pulses are fired in the \nsampling period, the switching frequency is too high, and the on-times are increased to reduce the steady-state \nswitching frequency. If too few pulses are fired during the sampling period, the switching frequency is too low \nand the on-times are reduced to increase the steady-state frequency. The PWM pin assigned to ORDER=0 is \nused for counting purposes, as it does not drop due to phase shedding.\nVIN +\n±gm\n+\n±IAVG\x081 µs\nFilterdischarge\n+\n+\n+VDACtON1Tristate\nPWM\nLogicPWM1CLK_ON\n+\nFrequency \nControl\nREFCLKPWM\n(one per channel)FREQUENCY_SWITCH\nIL1KT1\n×VOUT_SCALE_LOOP\nFigure 7-23.

Figure 7-24  illustrates the load insertion behavior, in which PWM pulses are \ngenerated with faster frequency than the steady-state frequency, to provide more energy to the output voltage, \nimproving undershoot performance. Figure 7-25  illustrates the load release behavior, in which PWM pulses can \nbe delayed to avoid charging extra energy to the load until the output voltage reaches the peak overshoot.\nWhen there is a sudden load increase, the output voltage immediately drops. The controller device reacts to this \ndrop by lowering the voltage on internal V COMP  signal. This forces PWM pulses to fire more frequently, which \ncauses the inductor current to rapidly increase. As the converter output current reaches the new load current, the \ndevice reaches a steady-state operating condition and the PWM switching resumes the steady-state frequency.\nWhen there is a sudden load release, the output voltage immediately overshoots. The control loop reacts to this \nrise by increasing the voltage of the internal V COMP  signal. This rise forces the PWM pulses to be delayed until \nthe converter output current reaches the new load current. At that point, the switching resumes and steady-state \nswitching continues. In Figure 7-24  and Figure 7-25 , the ripples on V OUT , and V COMP  voltages are not shown for \nsimplicity.\nIOUT\nVOUT\nCLK_ON\nPWM1VCOMP\nVRAMPISUM\nPWM2\nPWM3\nPWM4\nFigure 7-24.

To improve noise \nimmunity, the controller forces a minimum on-time whenever the PWM pins pulse high. The off-time for any \nphase is limited by a forced minimum off-time. Although TI smart power stage devices have built-in protection \nfrom glitches on the PWM pins also, this feature provides redundant protection against cross-conduction issues.\nThe controller also limits the time between sending pulses to any two adjacent phases. This is referred to as \nthe leading-edge blanking time, t BLANK . Increase the leading edge blanking time to prevent over-compensation \n(or "ring-back") by the controller during heavy load transient events. The minimum on-time, minimum off-time, \nand leading edge blanking time are programmable by the NONLINEAR_CONFIG  PMBus command. Refer to the \nTechnical Reference Manual  for a register map of this command.\nFor multiphase designs, the maximum per-phase switching frequency during transients, is limited by the leading \nedge blanking time parameters as shown in Equation 26 . The controller also forces a minimum-off-time per \nphase. The greater of the two limits the maximum frequency.\nfPHASE(max) =1\nNΦ× tBLANK(35)\nwhere\n•NΦ is the number of active phases\n•tBLANK  is the leading edge blanking time in seconds\n7.6.7 Nonlinear: undershoot reduction (USR), overshoot reduction (OSR) and dynamic integration\nNonlinear features improve the controller response to severe repetitive load transient conditions.\nWhen the controller is subjected to load transients at very high frequency, the output voltage may not be able to \ncompletely settle before the next transient event occurs. As a result, particularly during overshoot events, when \nthe controller is firing pulses infrequently, the controller integration path can see error which does not completely \nsettle. Accumulation of large overshoot error can cause the controller response to following undershoot events \nto be slower. To prevent excess accumulation of error during repetitive load transient events, the controller \nimplements dynamic integration . When the output voltage overshoots its target by a certain voltage, V DINT, the \ncontroller integration time constant can be changed to an alternate value, the dynamic integration time constant. \nUse the COMPENSATION_CONFIG  command to configure the dynamic integration time constant and threshold \nvoltage. Typically, set the dynamic integration constant to a longer time than the static integration time constant.\nIOUT\nISUM×RDCLLISUMISUM slew rate limited by inductors\nVUSR1VUSR2\nVOSRVERR\nUSR1 phases added\nAll phases added Diode braking, \nPulse truncation VDROOPVOUT\nVDAC\nVDROOP\nVDINT\nDynamic \nintegration\nactive\nFigure 7-26.

The undershoot reduction (USR) feature allows the controller to add phases even before the output \ncurrent reaches the dynamic phase adding thresholds. This ensures the transient undershoot event is stopped \nas quickly as possible. TPS536C7B1 has two levels of USR. The USR1 threshold is used to quickly enable \na configurable number of phases, USR1_PH. The USR2 threshold adds all enabled phases, assigned to that \nchannel. Use the NONLINEAR_CONFIG  command to configure the USR1 and USR2 features.\nThe overshoot reduction (OSR) feature reduces output voltage overshoot during severe load transient events, \nby turning off the low-side FETs of the powerstage devices (e.g. tri-stating the controller PWM pins), when an \novershoot event occurs. The inductor current of each phase must remain continuous, forcing the output current \nthrough the body diode of each low-side FET. This dissipates excess energy more quickly than keeping the \npowerstage low-side FET fully conducting, due to the forward voltage drop characteristics of the body diodes. As \na result, the transient overshoot is smaller when this technique is used, compared to simply turning on the low-\nside FET of each powerstage. However, this results in excess heat which must be properly managed in systems \nwith highly repetitive transient conditions. Additionally, TPS536C7B1 can be configured to truncate PWM pulses, \nto reduce the worst-case response time to overshoot events. The NONLINEAR_CONFIG  command provides \nfour controls for overshoot reduction: an enable bit for diode braking, an enable bit for pulse truncation, the OSR \nthreshold, V OSR, and the diode braking timeout, which limits the maximum amount of time during which diode \nbraking takes place, to manage excess heating.

Use the alert response address (ARA) protocol to determine \nthe address of the device experiencing a fault condition in multi-slave systems.

Paged \nfault conditions only cause one channel to shut down when triggered. For latch-off faults, the enable for that \nchannel must be toggled to re-enable power conversion. For example, if channel B experiences an overvoltage \nfault, only channel B stops power conversion, and channel B must be commanded to disable power conversion, \nand re-enable power conversion to continue normal operation.\nShared  fault conditions apply to channels A and B simultaneously. Shared fault conditions cause both channels \nA and B to shut down when triggered.\nWarning  conditions do not cause any interruption to power conversion. They are meant to inform the system \nhost of changing conditions so that it can react prior to a fault being triggered. Warnings do conditions set \nassociated PMBus status bits and trigger the SMB_ALERT# signal when not masked.\nFault conditions set to the ignore response  are treated as warnings. Faults set to the ignore response do not \ncause any interruption of power conversion but do still cause status bits and SMB_ALERT# to trigger.\nFault conditions set to the latch-off response  cause power conversion to stop immediately. The channel must \nbe commanded to stop power conversion then restart to continue operation. Start-up from a latch-off fault \nis identical to a normal power-up and the configured TON_DELAY  is still observed. The RSTOSD option in \nMISC_OPTIONS  controls whether the boot voltage returns to its last programmed value, or boots to its VBOOT \nvalue.\nFault conditions set to the hysteretic response  cause power conversion to stop immediately. When the fault \ncondition no longer exists, the TPS536C7B1 attempts to restart immediately. The configured TON_DELAY  is still \nobserved.\nFault conditions set to the hiccup response  cause power condition to stop immediately. After a hiccup wait time, \n25 ms by default, TPS536C7B1 attempts to re-enable power conversion. The configured TON_DELAY  is still \nobserved. If the fault condition has disappeared, the start-up attempt succeeds and power conversion continues. \nOtherwise, the process repeats indefinitely. The RSTOSD option in MISC_OPTIONS  controls whether the boot \nvoltage returns to its last programmed value, or boots to its VBOOT value.\nThe TOFF_DELAY  is not respected during any fault shutdown response.www.ti.comTPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 65\n7.7.3 Fault behavior summary\nTable 7-8.

Figure 7-29  describes the overvoltage protection \nscheme in more detail.\n•Pre-Bias OVF  protects the converter while initialization runs. This protection is active t INIT-PBOV , 350 μs \nmaximum after the VCC pin voltage is established, until initialization is complete. The threshold is hard-coded \nto 3.7 V. In response to this condition, all PWM pins (regardless of channel assignment) pull low, regardless \nof the overvoltage response setting. This fault cannot be cleared without a power cycle of the VCC pin. \nThe fixed overvoltage protection becomes active after t INIT-LOGIC  , up to 20 ms after the VCC pin voltage is \nestablished. This fault detection cannot be disabled.\n•Fixed OVF  is a programmable limit based on the VSP pin voltage, above which it is not safe to operate \nthe load device. Program the threshold through MFR_PROTECTION_CONFIG . This fault detection is active \nregardless of power conversion. If triggered while power conversion is disabled, this fault is treated as \npotentially catastrophic, and cannot be cleared without a power cycle of the VCC pin.\n•Tracking OVF  is a fault limit, programmable as an offset from the current VOUT_COMMAND  value. Program \nthis threshold through VOUT_OV_FAULT_LIMIT . When the VSP-VSN pin differential voltage exceeds this \nlimit during power conversion, the tracking overvoltage fault condition is detected. This fault detection is \ndisabled whenever power conversion is disabled.\n•Tracking OVW  is a warning limit, programmable as an offset from the current VOUT_COMMAND  value. \nProgram this threshold through VOUT_OV_WARN_LIMIT . When the VSP-VSN pin differential voltage \nexceeds this limit during power conversion, the tracking overvoltage warning condition is detected. This is a \nwarning condition only, and does not cause any interruption to power conversion. The overvoltage warning \nprovides early feedback to they system host allowing it to make adjustments prior a fault triggering.\nIn response to the overvoltage warning condition, TPS536C7B1 sets the appropriate status bits in \nSTATUS_WORD  and STATUS_VOUT  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\nIn response to the overvoltage fault condition TPS536C7B1 responds according to the programmed \nVOUT_OV_FAULT_RESPONSE . When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins of the rail \nwhich experienced a fault to pull low immediately. Additionally, TPS536C7B1 sets the appropriate status bits in \nSTATUS_WORD  and STATUS_VOUT  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\nVR_EN\nVOUTVR_RDY\nVOFS-UVFTRKVCC\nVOV-FIXEDVOV-PREBIAS\nNo \nOVPPre-Bias \nOVP onlyFixed \nOVP only\nFirst PWM pulsesFixed +Tracking OVP Fixed\nOVP onlytINIT-PBOVtINIT-LOGIC\nVOFS-UVWTRKVOFS-OVFTRK\nVOFS-UVFTRK\nFigure 7-29.

The threshold voltages get scaled with the use \nof an external voltage sensing divider and VOUT_SCALE_LOOP . TPS536C7B1 supports tracking overvoltage \nwarning offsets from +24 mV to +448 mV in 8 mV steps.\nProgram the fixed overvoltage fault threshold through MFR_PROTECTION_CONFIG .

After the output \nvoltage target has been changed, TPS536C7B1 reports the fault and warning thresholds by adding the \npreviously select offset value to the current VOUT_COMMAND .\nExample: Programming the OVF and OVW offsets\nAssume the current VOUT_COMMAND  is 1.000 V, the VOUT_DROOP  setting is equal to 0.5 m Ω, and the load \ncurrent is equal to 100 A.\n•Program the VOUT_OV_WARN_LIMIT  to 1.128 V (1.0 V + 128 mV), to select the +128 mV tracking \novervoltage warning offset. The VOUT_DROOP  is assumed to be zero for calculation purposes. However, \nthe over-voltage warning trip threshold does account for the load-line setting and is equal to 1.128 V - 0.5 mΩ \n× IOUT.\n•Program the VOUT_OV_FAULT_LIMIT  to 1.256 V (1.0 V + 256 mV) , to select the +256 mV tracking \novervoltage fault offset. The VOUT_DROOP  is assumed to be zero for calculation purposes. However, the \nover-voltage fault trip threshold does account for the load-line setting and is equal to 1.256 V - 0.5 mΩ × I OUT.\nIf the VOUT_COMMAND  value is changed to is 1.100 V, the TPS536C7B1 reports VOUT_OV_WARN_LIMIT  as \n1.228 V (1.1 V + 128 mV), and VOUT_OV_FAULT_LIMIT  as 1.356 V (1.1 V + 256 mV). The offset values are not \nchanged.www.ti.comTPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 69\n7.7.4.2 Undervoltage fault (UVF) and warning (UVW)\nTwo undervoltage threshold limits are provided:\n•Tracking UVF  is a fault limit, programmable as an offset from the current VOUT_COMMAND  value. Program \nthis threshold through VOUT_UV_FAULT_LIMIT . When the VSP-VSN pin differential voltage falls below this \nlimit during power conversion, the tracking undervoltage fault condition is detected. This fault detection is \ndisabled whenever power conversion is disabled.\n•Tracking UVW  is a warning limit, programmable as an offset from the current VOUT_COMMAND  value. \nProgram this threshold through VOUT_UV_WARN_LIMIT . When the VSP-VSN pin differential voltage \nexceeds this limit during power conversion, the tracking undervoltage warning condition is detected. This \nis a warning condition only, and does not cause any interruption to power conversion. The undervoltage \nwarning provides early feedback to they system host allowing it to make adjustments prior a fault triggering.\nIn response to the undervoltage warning condition, TPS536C7B1 sets the appropriate status bits in \nSTATUS_WORD  and STATUS_VOUT  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\nIn response to the undervoltage fault condition TPS536C7B1 responds according to the programmed \nVOUT_UV_FAULT_RESPONSE . When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins of the \nrail which experienced a fault to tristate immediately. TPS536C7B1 then sets the appropriate status bits in \nSTATUS_WORD  and STATUS_VOUT  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\nProgram the tracking undervoltage fault threshold through the VOUT_UV_FAULT_LIMIT  command as an \nabsolute voltage. When a new VOUT_UV_FAULT_LIMIT  command is received, the device calculates the \ntracking undervoltage offset value internally according to Equation 38 .

The offset values are not \nchanged.\n7.7.4.3 Maximum turn-on time exceeded (TON_MAX)\nThe TON_MAX_FAULT_LIMIT  command sets a maximum allowable time during which the output voltage must \nreach the regulation window during turn-on. The TON_MAX time is defined as the time between the first \nswitching pulses, and the sensed output voltage exceeding the the minimum allowed regulation point, defined as \nVTONMAX , in Equation 35 . Program the TON_MAX_FAULT_LIMIT  greater than the TON_RISE .\nVTONMAX = VOUT_UV_FAULT_LIMIT −VOUT_DROOP × IOUT_OC_FAULT_LIMIT (44)\nFigure 7-30  illustrates the TON_MAX fault. TPS536C7B1 enables its undervoltage fault protection at the first \nPWM pulses, during the output voltage rise time.

When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins of the rail \nwhich experienced the fault to tristate immediately. The TPS536C7B1 then sets the appropriate status bits in \nSTATUS_WORD  and STATUS_VOUT  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\n7.7.4.4 Output commanded out-of-bounds (VOUT_MIN_MAX)\nThe VOUT_MIN  and VOUT_MAX  commands set the minimum and maximum allowed output voltage targets. \nTPS536C7B1 does not ramp the output voltage target for either channel outside these limits for any reason.

Detection is based on output current telemetry. When the sensed output current \nfor a channel exceeds this limit, the output overcurrent fault is detected. Program this threshold using the \nIOUT_OC_FAULT_LIMIT  command with the PHASE  set to FFh. TPS536C7B1 supports values of 0 to 1023 A \nper channel.\n•Per-phase overcurrent limit (OCL)  is a programmable cycle-by-cycle valley current  limit for each individual \nphase current, to protect against inductor saturation. TPS536C7B1 does not pass PWM pulses to phases \nwhen their current is above the configured OCL threshold. Other than cycle-by-cycle current limit, no action \nis taken when the per-phase OCL is engaged. Typically, in the case of a severe overload event, power \nconversion is disabled when the output voltage reaches the VOUT_UV_FAULT_LIMIT . This is illustrated in \nFigure 7-32 . Program the OCL threshold using the IOUT_OC_FAULT_LIMIT  command with the PHASE  set to \n00h. TPS536C7B1 supports values of 17 A to 130 A per phase.\n•Overcurrent warning (OCW)  is a programmable warning threshold based on the total current  (sum of all \nphases) for a channel. Detection is based on output current telemetry. When the sensed output current for \na channel exceeds this limit, the output overcurrent warning is detected. Program this threshold using the \nIOUT_OC_WARN_LIMIT .

The temperature sense output of the powerstage device includes an OR\'ing \nfunction such that the voltage signal present at the TSEN pin of the TPS536C7B1 represents that of the hottest \npowerstage in the channel. The TPS536C7B1 digitizes its TSEN pins to provide temperature telemetry.\n•Overtemperature fault (OTF)  is a programmable threshold which sets the maximum allowed temperature of \nthe powerstage devices attached to a channel. Detection is based on output temperature telemetry. When the \nsensed temperature for a channel exceeds this limit, the overtemperature fault condition is detected. Program \nthis threshold using the OT_FAULT_LIMIT  command. TPS536C7B1 supports values of 90 to 160 °C.\n•Overtemperature warning (OTW)  is a programmable threshold which sets a warning based on the \ntemperature sense telemetry for a channel. Detection is based on temperature sense telemetry. When the \nsensed temperature for a channel exceeds this limit, the overtemperature warning is detected. Program this \nthreshold using the OT_WARN_LIMIT . TPS536C7B1 supports values of 90 to 160 °C.\nIn response to the overtemperature warning condition, TPS536C7B1 sets the appropriate status bits in \nSTATUS_WORD  and STATUS_TEMPERATURE  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not \nmasked.\nIn response to the overtemperature fault condition, TPS536C7B1 responds according to the programmed \nOT_FAULT_RESPONSE . When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins of the rail \nwhich experienced a fault to tristate immediately. TPS536C7B1 then sets the appropriate status bits in \nSTATUS_WORD  and STATUS_TEMPERATURE  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not \nmasked.TPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n74 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.7.4.8 Powerstage fault (TAO_HIGH) and powerstage not ready (TAO_LOW)\nIn addition to temperature sense information, the TPS536C7B1 and TI smart power stage devices use the TAO \nlines to communicate fault information:\n•Powerstage fault (TAO_HIGH)  is a fault condition detected when any of the connected powerstage devices \npulls its TAO line high (> 2.5 V). This occurs for any fault conditions detected inside the smart powerstage \nitself. Refer to the individual powerstage datasheets for a complete list of conditions which cause the \npowerstage fault. Program the controller response to a powerstage fault with MFR_PROTECTION_CONFIG .\n•Powerstage not ready (TAO_LOW)  is a fault condition detected when the TAO line is low (160 mV falling, \n245 mV rising) for any reason. At power-on, the TI smart power stages hold their TSEN/TAO lines low, \nuntil their internal logic is valid, and their state is known (TAO_LOW condition). Once each device is in a \nvalid state, it\'s pull-down of the shared TSEN/TAO line is released, and the TAO/TSEN lines are driven by \nthe power-stage devices, based on temperature sense telemetry. The start-up of TPS536C7B1 is blocked \nwhile the TAO_LOW condition exists, such that the controller does not attempt to begin conversion, until the \nTAO/TSEN line is released by all power stages. During the initial power-on, no status bit or alerts are set if \nthe controller is commanded to enable with one of its TSEN/TAO pins low. This is done to accomodate power \nsequences which have the power stage 5V rail being enabled after the controller 3.3V. The TAO_LOW fault \nis a hysteretic-type response. When the TSEN/TAO pin is released, if the VR enable condition is still active, \npower conversion starts immediately.\nIn response to the powerstage fault, the TPS536C7B1 responds according to the configured fault response \nin MFR_PROTECTION_CONFIG . When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins for that \nchannel to tristate immediately. TPS536C7B1 then sets the appropriate status bits in STATUS_WORD  and \nSTATUS_MFR_SPECIFIC  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\nIn response to the TAO_LOW condition, TPS536C7B1 tristates the PWM pins for that channel. TPS536C7B1 \nthen sets the appropriate status bits in STATUS_WORD  and STATUS_MFR_SPECIFIC  and asserts the \nSMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked. TAO_LOW is a hysteretic fault and cannot be configured \notherwise.\n7.7.4.9 Input overvoltage fault (VIN_OVF) and warning (VIN_OVW)\nTPS536C7B1 supports two layers of input overvoltage protection:\n•Input overvoltage fault (VIN_OVF)  is a programmable threshold which sets the maximum allowed input \nvoltage, above which it is not safe to convert power. Detection is based on input voltage telemetry. When \nthe sensed input voltage exceeds this limit, the input overvoltage fault condition is detected. Program this \nthreshold using the VIN_OV_FAULT_LIMIT  command. TPS536C7B1 supports values of 0 to 19 V.\n•Input overvoltage warning (VIN_OVW)  is a programmable threshold which sets a warning based on the \ninput voltage sense telemetry. Detection is based on input voltage sense telemetry. When the sensed input \nvoltage for a channel exceeds this limit, the input overvoltage warning is detected. Program this threshold \nusing the VIN_OV_WARN_LIMIT  command. TPS536C7B1 supports values of 0 to 19 V.\nIn response to the input overvoltage fault, the TPS536C7B1 responds according to the configured fault response \nin VIN_OV_FAULT_RESPONSE . When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins for both \nchannels to tristate immediately. TPS536C7B1 then sets the appropriate status bits in STATUS_WORD  and \nSTATUS_INPUT  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\n7.7.4.10 Input undervoltage fault (VIN_UVF), warning (VIN_UVW) and turn-on voltage (VIN_ON)\nThree programmable parameters control the TPS536C7B1 input undervoltage protection. More detail is shown \nin Figure 7-33 .\n•Turn-on voltage (VIN_ON)  is the input voltage at which TPS536C7B1 allows power conversion to be \nenabled. Program this threshold through the VIN_ON  command. The input undervoltage fault and warning \nare masked until the turn-on voltage is exceeded the first time during power-up. TPS536C7B1 does not act \non commands to enable power conversion while the input voltage is below this limit. No action is taken when \nthe input voltage falls below this threshold during power conversion. Detection is based on input voltage \ntelemetry. TPS536C7B1 supports values from 4.25 V to 11.5 V.www.ti.comTPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 75\n•Input undervoltage fault (VIN_UVF)  is the input voltage at which power conversion stops. Program this \nthreshold through the VIN_UV_FAULT_LIMIT  command. This command is also forced equal to the turn-off \nvoltage (VIN_OFF). Detection is based on input voltage telemetry. When the sensed input voltage falls below \nthis limit, the input undervoltage fault condition is detected. This fault is masked until the sensed input voltage \nexceeds the turn-on voltage VIN_ON  for the first time. TPS536C7B1 supports values from 4.00 V to 11.25 V.\n•Input undervoltage warning (VIN_UVW)  is a programmable threshold which sets a warning based on the \ninput voltage sense telemetry for a channel. Detection is based on input voltage sense telemetry. When the \nsensed input voltage below this limit, the input undervoltage warning is detected. Program this threshold \nusing the VIN_UV_WARN_LIMIT . TPS536C7B1 supports values of 4.0 V to 11.25 V.\nThe input undervoltage fault is triggered when the sensed input voltage falls below the VIN_UV_FAULT_LIMIT \nthreshold, and considered to be cleared when the sensed input voltage exceeds the VIN_ON  limit. The input \nundervoltage fault is enabled only when either of the channels is enabled. Toggling the enable for both channels \nat the same time with the input voltage above the VIN_UV_FAULT_LIMIT  threshold clears the fault, and enables \npower conversion to begin automatically after the input voltage exceeds the VIN_ON  limit. In the case where \nthe enable for each channel is independent, commanding one channel to enable conversion does not clear the \ninput undervoltage condition and power conversion may not start automatically when the input voltage exceeds \nthe VIN_ON  thresholds. TI recommends to enable power conversion only after the input voltage exceeds the \nVIN_ON  as shown in Figure 7-33 .\nVR_EN\nVINOFF = V IN-UVFVIN-UVWVIN-ON\nVIN\nOFF ON OFFPower Conversion\nNoneFault Status\nVIN_UVWVIN_UVFVIN_UVWVIN UVW is clearable 0.0 V\nNoneON\nFigure 7-33. Input undervoltage protection (VR_EN active high control)\n7.7.4.11 Input overcurrent fault (IIN_OCF) and warning (IIN_OCW)\n•Input overcurrent fault (IIN_OCF)  is a programmable threshold which sets the maximum allowed input \ncurrent for the converter. Detection is based on input current telemetry. When the sensed input current \nexceeds this limit, the input overcurrent fault condition is detected. Program this threshold using the \nIIN_OC_FAULT_LIMIT  command. TPS536C7B1 supports values of 4 to 128A.\n•Input overcurrent warning (IIN_OCW)  is a programmable threshold which sets a warning threshold for \nthe input current for the converter. Detection is based on input current telemetry. When the sensed input \ncurrent exceeds this limit, the input overcurrent warning condition is detected. Program this threshold using \nthe IIN_OC_WARN_LIMIT  command. TPS536C7B1 supports values of 4 to 128A.\nIn response to the input overcurrent fault, the TPS536C7B1 responds according to the configured fault response \nin IIN_OC_FAULT_RESPONSE . When not set to the ignore response, this causes the PWM pins for both \nchannels to tristate immediately. TPS536C7B1 then sets the appropriate status bits in STATUS_WORD  and \nSTATUS_INPUT  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these bits are not masked.\n7.7.4.12 Input overpower warning (PIN_OPW)\nThe PIN_OP_WARN_LIMIT  command sets an input overpower warning limit for the converter. Detection is \nbased on the input power telemetry, which is derived by multiplying the input voltage and input current TPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n76 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nmeasurement values. When the input current telemetry measurements exceeds this limit, TPS536C7B1 detects \nthe input overpower warning condition. TPS536C7B1 supports values from 8 to 2044 W.\nThe input overpower warning does not interrupt power conversion. In response, TPS536C7B1 sets the \nappropriate status bits in STATUS_WORD  and STATUS_INPUT  and asserts the SMB_ALERT# line if these \nbits are not masked.\n7.7.4.13 PMBus command, memory and logic errors (CML)\nThe STATUS_CML  command provides information about communication errors which have occurred. \nCommunication errors are warnings and do not cause any interruption to power conversion.\n•Invalid command (IVC)  occurs when the host attempts to access TPS536C7B1 at a command which it does \nnot support.\n•Invalid data (IVD)  occurs when the host sends data to a supported command which is out of range or \nunsupported.\n•Packet error check (PEC) error  occurs when TPS536C7B1 receives a transaction with an invalid or \nincorrect PEC byte.\n•Communication error (COMM)  occurs when the SMBus timeout condition is detected.\n•Other (CML_OTHER)  can occur due to multiple conditions (may not be an exhaustive list):\n–Wrong transaction prototype - e.g. accessing a read word command as a read block\n–Block command send with the incorrect number of bytes, or block count was not acknowledged\n–Bus arbitration was lost\n–Transaction aborted\n7.8 Device Functional Modes\nPower-on Reset (POR)\nWhen the VCC in voltage is below approximately 2.5 V, the TPS536C7B1 enters power-on reset, and all internal \nblocks return to their unpowered state. Raise the VCC voltage above the input UVLO threshold to exit the POR \nstate. Exiting POR requires up to 20 ms before power conversion can be enabled, during which the device \nre-loads all NVM values and performs pinstrap detection.\nDisabled state\nThe ON_OFF_CONFIG  PMBus command specifies the combination of VR_EN pins and OPERATION  command \ninput required to start power conversion. When the specified combination is not met (e.g. VR_EN is low, for \nVR_EN only, active high configuration), power conversion is disabled. The PWM pins assigned to the channel \nremain at tri-state, and the VR_RDY pin for the channel is pulled low. Once the enable conditions are met (e.g. \nVR_EN pulled high for VR_EN only, active high configuration), the controller begins power conversion, after a \nperiod of approximately 750 μs plus any added turn-on delay. The TPS536C7B1 device returns to the disabled \nstate after being disabled by the same means.\nTurn-on and turn-off delay\nThe TON_DELAY  and TOFF_DELAY  commands allow the user to add additional turn-on or turn-off delay \nbetween the time that enable/disable conditions are satisfied, and the TPS536C7B1 begins ramping the output \nvoltage. To ensure consistent behavior, TI recommends not to interrupt the turn-on or turn-off delays with \nadditional enable/disable requests.\nSoft-start and soft-off shutdown\nThe soft-start period begins when the first PWM pulses are fired after a channel is enabled, and ends when the \ninternal loop DAC reaches the boot voltage. During this time, the controller is raising the output voltage at a slew \nrate derived from to track the loop DAC, and tracking over/undervoltage protections are active.\nTPS536C7B1 may be configured to actively ramp the output voltage down to zero after being disabled through \nthe ON_OFF_CONFIG  command. During this time, the controller ramps down the loop DAC to zero at the slew www.ti.comTPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 77\nrate derived from TOFF_FALL . This behavior is optional, and the default configuration is to have the channel \nenter directly into the disabled state (immediate off).\nNormal operation\nThe TPS536C7B1 is in the normal state when converting power. During this time, the device responds to new \noutput voltage target (DVID) commands through PMBus as configured through the OPERATION  command.\nPower conversion continues in Auto-DCM, FCCM dynamic phase shedding, or all phases FCCM, as configured \nthrough the PMBus interface.\nFault shutdown (Latch-off)\nAny time a fault which is configured with the latch-off response is triggered, the device stops power conversion \non the affected channel (or both if caused by a shared fault). The PWM pins remain at tri-state for all faults, \nexcepting over-voltage faults which cause the PWM pins to remain low. The VR_RDY pin remains low as \nlong as the converter is disabled. It remains in this state until commanded to re-enable as specified in \nON_OFF_CONFIG .\nFault shutdown (Hiccup)\nAny time a fault which is configured with the hiccup response is triggered, the device stops power conversion \non the affected channel (or both if caused by a shared fault). The PWM pins remain at tri-state for all faults, \nexcepting over-voltage faults which cause the PWM pins to remain low. It remains in this state until a timer \nexpires, then attempt to re-enable itself, while respecting the configured TON_DELAY  and TOFF_DELAY  times. \nThe VR_RDY pin remains low as long as the converter is disabled, and re-asserts after a successful start-up \nattempt.\nPOR Fault shutdown\nSome fault conditions are considered catastrophic and cause the TPS536C7B1 to refuse any further enable \nattempts. These include: memory errors, internal logic errors, invalid pinstrap, pre-bias overvoltage protection \nconditions. The only way to recover from a POR fault is to re-cycle the VCC pin voltage below the POR \nthreshold.TPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n78 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.9 Programming\n7.9.1 PMBus overview\nTPS536C7B1 is designed to be compatible with the timing and physical layer electrical characteristics of the \nPower Management Bus (PMBus) Specification, part I, revision 1.3.1 available at http://pmbus.org . The 100-kHz, \n400-kHz, and 1000-kHz classes are supported. Input logic levels are designed to be compaitible with 1.8-V and \n3.3-V logic. PMBus revision 1.3 is derived from the System Managmenet Bus (SMBus) revision 3.0, available at \nhttp://smbus.org/ . The communication mechanism is based on the inter-integrated circuit I2C protocol.\nA master with clock stretching support is mandatory for communication with TPS536C7B1 through the PMBus \ninterface. TPS536C7B1 does support the packet error check (PEC) protocol. If the system host supplies clock \npulses for the PEC byte, PEC is used. If the CLK pulses are not present before a STOP, the PEC is not used. \nTPS536C7B1 can be configured to require PEC for each transaction in systems which require high reliability of \ncommunication.\nTPS536C7B1 supports the SMB_ALERT# response protocol. The SMB_ALERT# response protocol is a \nmechanism by which a slave device can alert the master device that it is available for communication. The \nmaster device processes this event and simultaneously accesses all slave devices on the bus (that support the \nprotocol) through the alert response address (ARA). Only the slave device that caused the alert acknowledges \nthis request. The host device performs a modified receive byte operation to ascertain the slave devices address. \nAt this point, the master device can use the PMBus status commands to query the slave device that caused the \nalert. By default, these devices implement the auto alert response, a manufacturer specific improvement to the \nSMB_ALERT# response protocol, intended to mitigate the issue of bus hogging. For more information on the \nSMBus alert response protocol, see the System Management Bus (SMBus) specification.\n7.9.2 PMBus transaction types\nSupport for the following SMBus transaction types is mandatory. The use of PEC is optional. Refer to the SMBus \nspecification and Technical Reference Manual  for more detailed transaction diagrams.\nSMBus Write Block and Read Block transaction types contain a repeated start condition, which may not be \ncompatible with all I2C master device IP.\n•Write Byte / Read Byte\n•Write Word / Read Word\n•Write Block / Read Block\n•Send Byte / Receive Byte\n•Block-Write-Block-Read Process Call (for SMBALERT_MASK commands)\n7.9.3 PMBus data formats\nTPS536C7B1 supports 3 data formats according to the PMBus specification. The data format for each command \nis listed along with its address and supported values.\n•ULINEAR16 format  uses a 16-bit unsigned integer. The default LSB size is 2-10 = 0.97656 mV\n•SLINEAR16 format  uses a 16-bit number representing a decimal. This number has two fields: the 5 MSB \nbits form an two\'s complement exponent , referred to as N, and the 11 LSB bits form a two\'s complement \nmantissa , referred to as M. The decimal number is represented as D = M × 2N\n•Unsigned binary format  uses direct bit maps with each command being subdivided into multiple fields \nthat can have different meaning. Refer to the register maps in the Technical Reference Manual  for these \ncommands.\nTPS536C7B1 accepts writes to SLINEAR11 format commands with any desired exponent value. TI recommends \nusing the default exponent listed for each command for writes to ensure consistent NVM store and restore \nbehavior.\nTelemetry commands in the SLINEAR11 format return data with variable exponent values according to the \nabsolute value of the retured value. As a rule TPS536C7B1 returns data in the SLINEAR11 format with the \nsmallest possible exponent, to provide the highest possible command resolution. As a result the host must be \nable to support decoding of the SLINEAR11 format with any exponent value.www.ti.comTPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 79\n7.9.3.1 Example PMBus number format conversions\nExample: Decode SLINEAR11 number E804h\nE804h = 11101  00000000100 b\nExponent = 11101 b.

ULINEAR16 to floating point conversion\n7.9.4 Raw non-volatile memory programming\nTPS536C7B1 has 256 bytes of internal EEPROM non-volatile memory (NVM). Each PMBus command with \nNVM backup is mapped into the NVM array. For example, if a command supports 16 possible values, there are 4 \ncorresponding bits for that field. The NVM array is designed withstand being overwritten greater than 1,000 times \nover the lifetime of the device.\nThe USER_NVM_INDEX  and USER_NVM_EXECUTE  commands provide access to read and write the raw data \nbytes. These commands allow the entire configuration data for the device to be read/written with a minimum \nnumber of transactions, to save programming time. The USER_NVM_EXECUTE  command is a 32 byte block \nwhich accesses blocks of raw NVM data. The USER_NVM_INDEX  command is an auto-incrementing byte www.ti.comTPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 81\ncommand which which selects which 32 bytes of memory are being accessed via the USER_NVM_EXECUTE \ncommand.\nThe Fusion Digital Power Designer  software provided for this device is capable of exporting raw configuration \ndata, as well as XML configuration files containing the value of each PMBus command.\nConfiguration validation\nThe first 9 bytes of data returned by USER_NVM_EXECUTE  with index zero, are identifying information for \nthe configuration. Bytes 0 to 6 represent the IC_DEVICE_ID . Bytes 7-8 represent the IC_DEVICE_REV . Byte 9 \nrepresents the currently configured PMBus slave address.\nDuring the NVM import process, the controller checks these 9 bytes versus its current configuration, and NACKs \ntheUSER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index = 0) command if the data does not match.\nExample: Configuration validation\n•Reading the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index 0) from a configured device returns value 0x54 49 53 6C 70 00 \n00 04  60 … [NVM bytes 0 to 22]. This indicates the configuration data was generated from a device with \nIC_DEVICE_ID  0x54 49 53 6C 70 00 , IC_DEVICE_REV  00 04  and PMBus address 0x60.\n•Writing the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index 0) with the value 0x54 49 53 6C 70 00  00 04  60 … [NVM bytes \n0 to 22] to a new device causes it to check its IC_DEVICE_ID  is equal to 0x54 49 53 6C 70 00 , check its \nIC_DEVICE_REV  is equal to 00 04  and check its PMBus address 0x60. If any of these checks fail, the write \noperation is rejected.\n•Writing the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index 0) with the value 0xFF FF FF FF FF FF  00 04  60 … [NVM bytes \n0 to 22] to a new device causes it skip the IC_DEVICE_ID  check, but still check its IC_DEVICE_REV  is equal \nto 00 04  and check its PMBus address 0x60. If any of these checks fail, the write operation is rejected.\n•Writing the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index 0) with the value 0xFF FF FF FF FF FF  FF FF  60 … [NVM bytes \n0 to 22] to a new device causes it skip the IC_DEVICE_ID  check, skip its IC_DEVICE_REV  check, but still \ncheck its PMBus address 0x60. If any of these checks fail, the write operation is rejected.\n•Writing the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index 0) with the value 0xFF FF FF FF FF FF  FF FF  FF … [NVM bytes \n0 to 22] to a new device causes it skip the IC_DEVICE_ID  check, skip its IC_DEVICE_REV  check, and skip \nits PMBus address check. No checks were performed, so the data is accepted.\nProcedure: Read all configuration data\nFollow the procedures below to read-back NVM data for TPS536C7B1 devices.\n1.Configure the device as desired through PMBus commands, then issue STORE_USER_ALL . Power cycle \nthe device or issue RESTORE_USER_ALL  with power conversion disabled to ensure operating memory and \nnon-volatile memory bytes are matching.\n2.Write the USER_NVM_INDEX  command to 00h.\n3.Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  command (index = 0).\n4.Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  command (index = 1).\n5.Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  command (index = 2).\n6.Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  command (index = 3).\n7.Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  command (index = 4).\n8.Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  command (index = 5).\n9.Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  command (index = 6).\n10.Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  command (index = 7).\n11.Read back and record the USER_NVM_EXECUTE  command (index = 8). The last 23 bytes of this \ncommand are not used by the device. TI recommends replacing these bytes with 00h for consistency across \ndifferent configurations.\nProcedure: Write all configuration data\nFollow the procedures below to write NVM data for TPS536C7B1 devices.\n1.Apply +3.3V to the VCC pin of TPS536C7B1TPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n82 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n2.Ensure power conversion is disabled for both channels.\n3.Write the USER_NVM_INDEX  command to 00h.\n4.Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index = 0). In this example, disable the self-\nvalidation checks by replacing the first 9 bytes with FFh.\n5.Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index = 1).\n6.Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index = 2).\n7.Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index = 3).\n8.Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index = 4).\n9.Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index = 5).\n10.Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index = 6).\n11.Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index = 7).\n12.Write the previously recorded USER_NVM_EXECUTE  (index = 8). Replace the last 23 bytes with 00h. An \nNVM store operation is automatically performed once the last block is successfully received.\n13.Wait 100 ms for non-volatile memory programming to complete successfully. Ensure that the +3.3V power \nsupply to the device is not interrupted during this time to guarantee proper memory storage and retention.\n14.Do not  issue an NVM store operation at this point. This overwrites the NVM array with the data values in \noperating memory.\n15.Power cycle the device or issue RESTORE_USER_ALL  to continue operation with the newly programmed \nvalues. Multifunction pin configurations require a power cycle to take effect.www.ti.comTPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 83\nTable 7-10.

It is common practice to limit the ripple current to between 20%-40% \nof maximum per-phase current for balanced performance. In this design example, 30% of the maximum per-\nphase current is used for channel A.\nΔIRIPPLE(target) =ICC(MAX)\nNΦ× 30% =400A\n10phases× 0.3 = 12.0 A (48)\nLtarget =VOUT ×( V in(max) −VOUT\nVin(max) × ΔI RIPPLE(target) × fSW=0.88V ×( 13.2V −0.88V\n13.2V × 12A × 500kHz= 0.137μH (49)\nConsidering the variation and derating of the inductance and a standard inductor value of 150nH with DCR 0.125 \nmΩ, is selected. Then use Equation 41  to re-calculate the actual output ripple.\nIRIPPLE(actual) =VOUT ×Vin(max) −VOUT\nVin(max) × fSW× Lactual=0.88V ×( 13.2V −0.88V\n13.2V × 500kHz × 0.150μH= 10.9A (50)\nWith same design procedure for channel B, a standard inductor value of 150 nH with DCR 0.125 m Ω from ITG is \nchosen.\nOutput Capacitor Selection\nGenerally, consider output ripple and output voltage deviation during load transient when selecting output \ncapacitors.\nWhen available, follow the output capacitance recommendation for the load ASIC reference design. With \nTPS536C7B1 device, it is possible to meet the load transient with lower output capacitance due to the www.ti.comTPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 133\nhigh-speed nature of DCAP+ control.

Choose 125% margin to avoid triggering current limit \nduring load transient events. For this design, choose the 47A valley current limit for channel A.\nISAT(min) = IOCL + ΔI RIPPLE = 47A + 10.9A = 57.9A (52)\nEquation 43  indicates the minimum saturation current for inductor. Using same design procedure, the valley \ncurrent limit for channel B is selected to be 26 A.\nSet USR threshold to improve load transient performance\nThere are two levels of undershoot reduction (USR1, USR2) options. USR1 enables up to 3, 4, 5 or all normal \nphases and USR2 enables all available phases. To select the proper value, start with each USR threshold set to \nbe disabled, and then systematically lower the threshold, enabling fast-phase-addition to meet the load transient \nrequirement.\nFor this design, phase shedding is disabled. USR1 and USR2 are selected to be disabled for both channel A and \nchannel B.\nInput Current Sensing (Shunt/ Calculated Iin/ Inductor DCR)\nTPS536C7B1 has three input current sensing options: shunt current sensing, calculated input current sensing \nand inductor DCR current sensing. Either option may be chosen for precision input current reporting.\nShunt current sensing\nIn this design, the external shunt resistor 0.5 m Ω ± 1%, 3 W, 4026 package is selected. Once properly \ncalibrated, Input current reporting is within the tolerance target.\nCalculated input current sensing\nTPS536C7B1 includes an option to impute input current for situations in which the addition of a shunt or \ninput inductor is prohibitive. Connect pins 46 (VIN_CSNIN) and 47 (CSPIN) together, and place a minimum \n1 μF effective capacitance bypass cap from pin 46 to GND, then connect pin 46 to input supply (12 V \nnominally) before input inductor. Configure the calculated input current option through the NVM settings in \nMFR_SPECIFIC_ED (MISC OPTIONS).TPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n134 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nInductor DCR Current Sensing\nThis section describes the procedure to determine an inductor DCR thermal compensation network design. \nFigure 8-6  shows a typical DCR sensing circuit. From Equation 44  and Equation 45 , when the time constant of \nthe RC network is equal to the L/R time constant of the inductor, the capacitor voltage V C across the C SENSE \ncapacitor can be used to obtain the inductor current. However, inductor windings have a positive temperature \ncoefficient of approximately 3900 ppm/°C. So an NTC thermistor is used to cancel thermal variation from the \ninductor DCR.\nThe design goal is for the DCR value to be invariant with the temperature. Therefore, the voltage across sense \ncapacitor would be only dependent on the inductor current over the temperature range of interest.\nFigure 1Vout VinRDCR\nC RL\nVc\nFigure 212Vin to power stage 12VinRDCR\nCSENSERSEQUL\nVcRNTC RSERIES\nRPARRP_NIIN\nIIN_CSP IIN_CSN\nFigure 8-6.

Select C SENSE  as 1 μF X7R or better dielectric (C0G preferred).\nIn order to solve the value of R SEQU , RSERIES  and R PAR, the β at three temperature points are set equal. set β = \n0.15 m Ω equally at temperature 0 °C, 25 °C and 75 °C. With the calculation, three resistors value can be found \nas R SEQU  = 332 Ω, R SERIES  = 432 Ω, R PAR = 1.40 kΩ.\nFigure 8-7.

The VCC supply, power stage VDD \n5V supply, VIN_CSNIN and CSPIN supplies may be safely powered up independently of each other, even if \nthe VCC supply voltage is off and low-impedance. Do not raise pull-up voltages for open-drain pins AVR_RDY, \nBVR_RDY, SMB_ALRT#, SMB_DIO, VR_FAULT# before the VCC supply, or pull them to voltages above the \nVCC voltage during operation. If system sequencing requirements mandate raising the pull-up voltages for these \npins prior to VCC being established, limit the pin current to 1.0 mA to avoid damage to the device.\nThe minimum pull-up resistor value for open drain pins AVR_RDY, BVR_RDY, SMB_ALRT#, SMB_DIO, \nVR_FAULT# is limited by the allowable sinking current for the pin. The maximum pull-up resistor value is limited \nby the off-state leakage current for the pin, and the logic level of any downstream device using the pin as an \ninput. Table 9-1  summarizes the allowable sinking current and off-state leakage for open drain IO pins.\nTable 9-1. Open Drain Pin Current Capability\nOpen-drain PinMaximum Current\nOn-state Sinking\n(mA)Off-state leakage 1\n(μA)\nAVR_RDY 25.0 1.0\nBVR_RDY 25.0 1.0\nSMB_ALRT# 20.0 1.0\nSMB_DIO 20.0 1.0\nVR_FAULT# 20.0 4.0\n1.TJ = 125°C\nFor input pins ACSPx, BCSPx, AVR_EN, BVR_EN, SYNC, RESET#, which exceed the VCC pin value during \noperation, during power-on or otherwise, include a series resistor of 10.0 k Ω or greater to limit the current into \nthe pin.\nIt is safe to power-on the VDD 5V supply to TI smart power stage devices prior to TPS536C7B1 VCC. TI smart \npower stage devices do not source any unsafe voltages or currents into TPS536C7B1 ACSPx, BCSPx, ATSEN, \nBTSEN, APWMx, BPWMx pins when the VCC pin is not powered.\nTI smart power stages (CSD95xxx) provide hysteresis current on their PWM input pins to improve noise \nimmunity. This current is active when the power stage is powered by 5V VDD and enabled, regardless of the \nstatus of VCC. When the VCC pin of TPS536C7B1 is unpowered, this hysteresis current flows through the PWM \npins, to ESD structures in the controller, causing the PWM pin voltage to float low, out of the tri-state window. \nThis can cause the power stage device to switch its low-side power MOSFET on. As a result, in any case where \nthe power stage VDD 5V power supply is enabled prior to VCC, supply, TI recommends to control the power \nstage enable pin to be low until both supply voltages are established.\nTPS536C7B1 voltage and current protections become active when the controller VCC supply is powered. TI \nrecommends the VCC voltage be powered first, prior to power stage 5V, or VIN_CSNIN/CSPIN voltages. In \ngeneral, TI recommends to assert the AVR_EN/BVR_EN pins last in the power sequence.\nOther sequences are permissible, but may not be able to make use of the controller protection features. For \nexample, if a board assembly issue causes the power input supply (e.g. nominally 12V supply) to charge the \noutput voltage, the TPS536C7B1 over-voltage protection can protect the load device by forcing the PWM pins \nlow, causing the power stage devices to discharge the output voltage, but only if the VCC supply is established \nby the time the power input voltage rises.www.ti.comTPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 141\n10 Layout\nProper layout techniques are critical to power supply performance. The recommendations given in this document \nare meant to minimize risk and give the highest possibility of first pass success. Other layout designs are \npossible but may carry higher risk of performance issues. Contact your TI local field/sales representative for \nin-depth guidance and layout reviews.\nThe driverless controller architecture makes it easy to separate noisy driver interface lines from sensitive \ncontroller signals. Because the power stage is external to the device, all gate drive and switch node traces must \nbe local to the inductor and power stages.\nController Layout Guidelines\n•Keep minimum 800 mil distance between the controller and the closest power stage\n•Ensure the controller and all power stages must share a common ground plane\n•Route CSPx /VREF differentially from controller to IOUT/REFIN pin of each power stages on a quiet inner \nlayer. Alternately, create a small VREF copper plane between controller and power stages, and embed the \nCSPx traces inside VREF plane.\n•PWMx must be routed on a different quiet inner layer and not on the same layer next to CSPx/VREF \ndifferential pairs.\nNote\nMOST IMPORTANT LAYOUT RECOMMENDATION: Must keep min 40mil clearance between 12Vin \ncopper/vias/traces and sensitive analog interface lines.\nPower stage layout guidelines\n•Use the recommended land and via pattern for power stage footprint\n•Make layer 2 on the PCB stack a solid ground plane\n•Maximize the phase pitch between adjacent phases whenever possible to prevent any cross-coupling noise \nbetween devices (9 mm or higher is preferred)\n•In cases where the phase pitch is tighter, adjust the controller phase firing order to minimize noise coupling \nbetween devices.\n•The input voltage bypass capacitors require a minimum two vias per pad(for both Vin and GND)\n•Place additional GND vias along the sides of device as space allows\n•For multi-phase systems, ensure that the GND pour connects all phases.\n•Connect the VOS pin feedback point to the inner edge of the inductor output pad.\n•Place VDD and PVDD bypass capacitors directly next to pins on the same layer of the device.TPS536C7\nSLUSDI9 – SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n142 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nLayout example\nFigure 10-1.
