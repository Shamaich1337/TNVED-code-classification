Measured, when the output drops 100 mVbelow its nominal value. The junction temperature, loadcurrent, and minimum input supply requirements affect the\ndropout level.\nOutput Noise Voltage\nThis is the integrated value of the output noise over a\nspecified frequency range. Input voltage and output loadcurrent are kept constant during the measurement. Results\nare expressed in /C0109V\nrms or nV √Hz.\nGround Current\nGround Current is the current that flows through the\nground pin when the regulator operates without a load on its\noutput (I GND). This consists of internal IC operation, bias,\netc. It is actually the difference between the input current\n(measured through the LDO input pin) and the output load\ncurrent. If the regulator has an input pin that reduces itsinternal bias and shuts off the output (enable/disablefunction), this term is called the disable current (I\nDIS.)Line Regulation\nThe change in output voltage for a change in input voltage.\nThe measurement is made under conditions of lowdissipation or by using pulse techniques such that theaverage junction temperature is not significantly affected.\nLine Transient Response\nTypical output voltage overshoot and undershoot\nresponse when the input voltage is excited with a givenslope.\nLoad Transient Response\nTypical output voltage overshoot and undershoot\nresponse when the output current is excited with a givenslope between no −load and full −load conditions.\nThermal Protection\nInternal thermal shutdown circuitry is provided to protect\nthe integrated circuit in the event that the maximum junction\ntemperature is exceeded. When activated at typically 175 °C,\nthe regulator turns off. This feature is provided to preventfailures from accidental overheating.\nMaximum Package Power Dissipation\nThe power dissipation level at which the junction\ntemperature reaches its maximum operating value.\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe NCP690 regulator is self −protected with internal\nthermal shutdown and internal current limit. Typicalapplication circuit is shown in Figure 1.\nInput Decoupling (C IN)\nA ceramic 10 /C0109F capacitor is recommended and should be\nconnected close to the NCP690 package. Highercapacitance and lower ESR will improve the overall linetransient response.\nOutput Decoupling (C OUT)\nThe NCP690 does not require a minimum Equivalent\nSeries Resistance (ESR) for the output capacitor. Theminimum output decoupling capacitor required for stability\nis 1 /C0109F. In order to improve the load transient response and\nstart up performance 10 /C0109F capacitor is recommended. The\nregulator is stable with ceramic chip as well as tantalumcapacitors.  Larger values improve noise rejection and load\ntransient response.\nNo−Load Regulation Considerations\nThe required minimum 100 /C0109A load current is assured by\nthe internal resistor divider network.\nThe NCP690 contain an overshoot clamp circuit to\nimprove transient response during a load current steprelease. When output voltage exceeds the nominal byapproximately 20 mV , this circuit becomes active and\nclamps the output from further voltage increase. Tying theENABLE pin to V\nIN will ensure that the part is active\nwhenever the supply voltage is present,\nNoise Decoupling\nThe NCP690 is a low noise regulator and needs no\nexternal noise reduction capacitor. Unlike other low noiseregulators which require an external capacitor and have slow\nstartup times, the NCP690 operates without a noise\nreduction capacitor, has a typical 50 /C0109s turn−on time and\nachieves a 50 /C0109V\nrms overall noise level between 10 Hz and\n100 kHz.\nEnable Operation\nThe enable pin will turn the regulator on or off. The\nthreshold limits are covered in the electrical characteristicstable in this data sheet. The turn −on/turn−off transient\nvoltage being supplied to the enable pin should exceed a\nslew rate of 10 mV/ /C0109s to ensure correct operation. If the\nenable function is not to be used then the pin should beconnected to V\nIN.\nAdjustable Operation\nThe output voltage can be adjusted from 1 to 4 times the\ntypical 1.250 V regulation voltage by the use of resistor\nNCP690, NCP691, NCP692, NCV8690\nhttp://onsemi.com\n13divider network as shown on Figure 4. The output voltage\nand resistors should be chosen using Equations 1 and 2.\nVOUT/C00431.250/C04661/C0041R1\nR2/C0467/C0041(IADJ/C0064R1) (eq. 1)\nR2/C0094R11\nVOUT\n1.25/C00421(eq. 2)\nInput bias current I ADJ is typically less than 210 nA.\nChoose R 1 arbitrarily to minimize errors due to the bias\ncurrent and to minimize noise contribution to the output\nvoltage. Use Equation 2 to find the required value for R 2. If\nan output voltage of 1.25 V is desired, the adjustable pinshould be connected directly to the output pin.\nThermal Characteristics\nAs power dissipated in the NCP690 increases, it might\nbecome necessary to provide some thermal relief. The\nmaximum power dissipation supported by the device isdependent upon board design and layout. Mounting padconfiguration on the PCB, the board material, and theambient temperature af fect the rate of junction temperature\nrise for the part. When the NCP690 has good thermalconductivity through the PCB, the junction temperature will\nbe relatively low with high power applications. The\nmaximum dissipation the NCP690 can handle is given by:\nPD(MAX)/C0043[TJ(MAX)/C0042TA]\nR/C0113JA(eq. 3)\nSince T J is not recommended to exceed 125 °C (T J(MAX) ),\nthen the NCP690 can dissipate up to 1 W when the ambient\ntemperature (T A) is 25 °C.The power dissipated by the NCP690 can be calculated\nfrom the following equations:\nPD/C0091VIN(IGND@IOUT)/C0041IOUT(VIN/C0042VOUT)(eq. 4)\nor\nVIN(MAX)/C0091PD(MAX)/C0041(VOUT/C0032IOUT)\nIOUT/C0041IGND(eq. 5)\nFigure 32.

When the impedance of these traces ishigh, there is a chance to pick up noise or cause the regulator\nto malfunction. Place external components, especially the\noutput capacitor, as close as possible to the NCP690, andmake traces as short as possible.\nNCP690, NCP691, NCP692, NCV8690\nhttp://onsemi.com\n14DEVICE ORDERING INFORMATION\nDeviceNominal\nOutput Voltage Marking Package Shipping†\nNCP690MN15T2G 1.5 V 69015 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP690MN18T2G 1.8 V 69018 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP690MN25T2G 2.5 V 69025 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP690MN33T2G 3.3 V 69033 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP690MN50T2G 5.0 V 69050 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP690MNADJT2G ADJ 690AD DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP691MN15T2G 1.5 V 69115 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP691MN18T2G 1.8 V 69118 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP691MN25T2G 2.5 V 69125 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP691MN33T2G 3.3 V 69133 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP691MN50T2G 5.0 V 69150 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP691MNADJT2G ADJ 691AD DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP692MN15T2G 1.5 V 69215 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP692MN18T2G 1.8 V 69218 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP692MN25T2G 2.5 V 69225 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP692MN33T2G 3.3 V 69233 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP692MN50T2G 5.0 V 69250 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP692MNADJT2G ADJ 692AD DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCV8690MN33T2G* 3.3 V V69033 DFN6\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\n†For information on tape and reel specifications, including part orientation and tape sizes, please refer to our Tape and Reel Packaging\nSpecifications Brochure, BRD8011/D.\n*NCV Prefix for Automotive and Other Applications Requiring Unique Site and Control Change Requirements; AEC −Q100 Qualified and PPAP\nCapable.\nDFN6 3*3 MM, 0.95 PITCH\nCASE 506AH −01\nISSUE O\nDATE 17 NOV 2004 SCALE 2:1\nGENERIC\nMARKING DIAGRAM*\nxxxxx = Specific Device Code\nA = Assembly Location\nY = YearWW = Work Week\n/C0071 = Pb−Free Package\n*For additional information on our Pb −Free strategy and soldering\ndetails, please download the ON Semiconductor Soldering and\nMounting Techniques Reference Manual, SOLDERRM/D.SOLDERING FOOTPRINT* *This information is generic.
