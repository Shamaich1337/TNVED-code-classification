NCP1568employs a proprietary variable frequency algorithm to enable zerovoltage switching (ZVS) of Super −Junction or GaN FETs across line,\nload, and output conditions. The ZVS feature increases power densityof a power converter by increasing the operating frequency while\nachieving high efficiency. The Active Clamp Flyback (ACF)\noperation simplifies EMI filter design to avoid interference with other\nsensitive circuits in the system. The NCP1568 features a HV startupcircuit, a strong low side driver, and a 5 V logic level driver for theactive clamp FET. The NCP1568 is suitable for a variety of\napplications including ac −dc adapters, industrial, telecom, lighting,\nand other applications where power density is an importantrequirement.\nThe NCP1568 also features multimode operation and transitions\nfrom ACF mode to Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) to meetregulatory requirements from around the world. The NCP1568 further\nimplements skip in standby mode, resulting in excellent standbypower. The combination of flexible control scheme and userprogrammable features allow the use of NCP1568 withSuper−Junction MOSFET s (Si) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) FETs.\nFeatures\n•Topology and Control Scheme\n♦Active Clamp Flyback Topology Aids in ZVS\n♦Proprietary Multi −Mode Operation to Enhance Light Load\nEfficiency\n♦Proprietary Adaptive ZVS Allows High Frequency Operation\nwhile Reducing EMI\n♦Inbuilt Adaptive Dead −Time for Both Main and Active Clamp\nFETs\n♦Peak Current −Mode Control with Inbuilt Slope Compensation\nwith Options\n♦Flexible Control Scheme and Programmability Allow for\nConfiguration with Either External Silicon or GaN FETs\n•DCM and Light Load Operation\n♦Customer Programmable Optional Transition to DCM\n♦Integrated Frequency Foldback with Minimum Frequency \nClamp for Highest Performance in Standby Mode\n♦Minimum Frequency Clamp and Quiet Skip Eliminates \nAudible Noise\n♦Standby Power < 30 mW\n•Integrated HV and Startup Circuits\n♦700 V Startup Circuit\n♦AC Line Brownout Detect\n•Drivers\n♦0.85 A/1.5 A Source/Sink for Low Side\n♦65 mA/150 mA Active Clamp Driver OutputMARKING DIAGRAM\nTSSOP−16\nDT SUFFIX\nCASE 948BW\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information in the package\ndimensions section on page 2 of this data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATION1568\nXXX\nALYW /C0071\n/C00711\n16\n1568 = Specific Device Code\nXXX = Specific Variant \n= (S02, G03, G04)\nA = Assembly LocationL = Wafer Lot\nY = Year\nW = Work Week\n/C0071 = Pb−Free Package\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)\nFeatures (Continued)\n•Oscillator\n♦Programmable Frequency from \n100 kHz to 1 MHz\n♦Internal Soft −Start Timer with 4 \nOptions\n•Protection\n♦Dedicated FLT Pin Compatible with \na Thermistor\n♦Adjustable Over Power Protection\n(OPP)\n♦Option for Auto −Recovery and Latched\nin Various Faults\n♦Internal Thermal Shutdown\nApplications\n•USB Power Delivery\n•Notebook Adapters\n•High Density Chargers\n•Industrial Power Supplies\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n2ORDERING INFORMATION\nDeviceLEB/DTMAX/\nT_ZVSA\n(ns)T_ZVSB\n(ns)ACF FET\nSoft Start Time\n(ms)ACF FET\nSoft Stop Time\n(ms)Fixed Dead −Time\nfrom LDRV OFF to\nHDRV or ADRV\nON (ns)ATH Pin\nMapping Package Shipping†\nNCP1568S02DBR2G 179/420/210 150 4 0 20 I = 1.92 E = 1 TSSOP−16\n(Pb−Free)2,500 / \nTape & Reel\nNCP1568G03DBR2G 99/240/120 60 4 0.5 0 I = 1.92 E = 1 TSSOP−16\n(Pb−Free)2,500 / \nTape & Reel\nNCP1568G04DBR2G 99/240/120 100 4 0.5 0 I = 1.92 E = 1 TSSOP−16\n(Pb−Free)2,500 / \nTape & Reel\n†For information on tape and reel specifications, including part orientation and tape sizes, please refer to our Tape and Reel Packaging\nSpecifications Brochure, BRD8011/D.\nFigure 1.

TheNCP1568 is an ideal candidate for high frequency highdensity adapters, open frame power supplies, and many\nmore applications. The NCP1568 incorporates advanced\ncontrol and power management techniques as well asmultimode operation to meet stringent regulatoryrequirements. The NCP1568 is also enhanced withnon−dissipative overpower protection (OPP), brownout\nprotection, and frequency modulation in both ACF andDCM mode of operation for optimized efficiency over theentire power range. Accounting for the needs of extremely\nlow standby power requirements, the controller features\nminimized current consumption.High Voltage Startup\nThe NCP1568 integrates a high voltage startup circuit\naccessible through the HV pin. The HV pin also providesaccess to the brown out detection circuit, as well as linevoltage detectors that detect the ac line voltage range and the\npresence or absence of an ac line. The brown out detector\ndetects ac line interruptions and the line voltage detector\ndetermines the rectified voltage peaks at quantized voltagelevels. Depending on the detected input voltage range,device parameters are internally adjusted to optimize thesystem performance. The HV pin connects to both line andneutral through two diodes to achieve full −wave\nrectification as shown in Figure 4. A low value resistor inseries with the HV pin can be used to limit current in the\nevent of a pin short or sur ge. The series resistance of the HV\npin should not exceed 3 k /C0087, as the function of the brown out\nand line detection circuits will be hampered. Further, placinga capacitor from the HV pin to ground greater than 22 pF canpotentially cause misidentification of line removal.\nNCP1568HVEMI\nFilterL\nNR1HV\nR2HVR1HV+R 2 HV≤3k/C0087D1D2\nFigure 4. Typical HV Pin Connection\nThe HV startup regulator consists of constant current\nsources that supply current from the ac input terminals (V in)\nto the supply capacitor on the V CC pin (C CC). When the ac\ninput voltage is greater than V HV(discharge) , current is\nsourced from the HV pin to the V CC pin at I start1, typically\n0.5 mA until the voltage on the V CC pin exceeds V CC(inhibit) ,\ntypically 700 mV . Once the V CC(inhibit)  threshold has been\nexceeded, the startup circuit current increases to I start2,\ntypically 3.25 mA. The NCP1568 will continue to sourceI\nstart2 from the HV pin to the V CC pin when the  voltage is\nbelow V CC(on)  and the voltage on the HV pin is above\nVHV(MIN) . Istart2 is disabled if the V CC pin falls below\nVCC(inhibit) . In this condition, the startup current is reduced\nto Istart1. The internal high voltage startup circuits eliminate\nthe need for external startup components. In addition, thesecurrent sources reduce no load power and increase thesystem efficiency as the HV startup circuit has negligiblepower consumption in the normal, light load, and standbyoperations. During a typical startup, the V\nCC is charged up\nto V CC(on)  in tstart up with a 0.47 /C0109F capacitor.\nOnce the V CC capacitor C CC is charged to the startup\nthreshold, V CC(on) , the HV pin startup current sources are\ndisabled and a controller waits for the HV pin sensedbrown out threshold to be exceeded. If the input startupvoltage is not met, the startup current sources remaindisabled until V\nCC falls below the minimum operating\nvoltage threshold, V CC(off)  after the tdelay (Vcc_off)  expires.\nOnce the threshold is reached, the current sources are again\nenabled to charge V CC back up to V CC(on) . Figure 5 shows\na typical startup sequence. If the ac input voltage fails to\nmeet the brown out threshold or a fault is detected on the FLT\npin, the part will continue to operate by providing current to\nthe V CC capacitor as needed in HVBC until all faults are\ncleared. Once the V CC(on)  threshold is exceeded and the\nbrown in is identified, the part will charge up to V CC(on)  and\nthe soft start sequence will begin.\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n12A dedicated comparator monitors V CC and latches the\ncontroller into a low power state if V CC exceeds V CC(OVP)\nfor t delay(Vcc_OVP).  To reset the OVP fault, the V CC voltage\nmust by less than V CC(reset) .\nThe C CC provides power to the controller during power\nup. The capacitor must be sized such that a V CC voltage\ngreater than V CC(off)  is maintained while the auxiliary\nsupply voltage is ramping up. Otherwise, V CC will collapse\nand the controller will turn off. The operating IC biascurrent, I\nCC4, the high side driver current, and gate charge\nload at the low side and high side driver outputs must beconsidered to correctly size C CC. The increase in current\nconsumption due to external gate charge is calculated using\nEquation 2. Since the switching frequency is ramped from\n31 kHz to the desired switching frequency, a trapezoidal\nshape is assumed for the frequency both in the DCM mode,\nthe LEM operation, and ACF mode. The high side driver hasno gate drive losses during DCM operation, thus thefrequency is  set to zero and the switch only has the average\nof the applied switching time from LEM and ACFoperations as shown in Equation 1.\nfSW/C0043/C0466FSWMIN/C0041FSWDCM_MAX/C0042FSWMIN\n2/C0467/C0064TDCM/C0041/C0466FSWDCM_MAX/C0041FSWACF_MAX/C0042FSWDCM_MAX\n2/C0467/C0064/C0466TSS/C0042TDCM/C0467\nTSS/C0179(eq. 1)\n220.3 kHz /C0043/C046631.25 kHz /C004150 kHz /C004231.25 kHz\n2/C0467/C0064695/C0109s/C0041/C046650 kHz /C0041420 kHz /C004250 kHz\n2/C0467/C0064/C04668m s/C0042695/C0109s/C0467\n8m s\nAssuming a typical gate charge of 17 nC for the high side and low side MOSFETs.\nIICC(gate_Charge_Total)/C0043fsw_ls /C0064Qg_ls/C0041fsw_hs /C0064Qg_hs/C0179 (eq. 2)\n7.7 mA /C0043218.1 kHz /C006417/C0064nC/C0041235 kHz /C006417/C0064nC/C0179\nEquation 2 has ƒSW as the average soft start switching\nfrequency of the low side or high side MOSFET and Qg isthe gate charge of the external MOSFETs.Once the C\nCC is charged to the startup threshold, a delay\nof tdelay(start)  is used to stabilize all internal power supplies\nand ensure biasing is up before operation and level setting\ncan continue. After t delay(start)  expires, the IC will not start\nswitching until timers expire as shown in Figure 6.\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n13VCC(Inhibit )VCC(Off )VCC(on)VHV (Start )\nTdelay (start )\nStartup Current\n= Istart1Startup Current\n= Istart2\nFigure 5.

The DC leakage currents onthe pin are shown in the datasheet as I\nHV(Off1) , IHV(Off2),  and\nIHV(Off3) .\nBrown Out Detection\nThe HV pin provides access to the brownout and line\nvoltage detectors. Once V CC reaches V CC(on) , the HV pin to\nVCC pin current sources (I start1 and I start2) are turned off.\nOnce the current sources are turned off, the line voltage is\nassessed to determine if the brownout level has been\nexceeded. The line is not assessed any time the NCP1568 is\nsourcing current to the V CC pin. The startup sequence is\ninitiated once V HV is above the brown out threshold\n(VHV(start) ) for t delay(HV_start)  and the V CC voltage has been\ncharged back up to V CC(on)  by I start2. Every time the HV\nvoltage drops below the V BO(stop)  the t delay(HV_stop) ,\ntypically  300 /C0109s, timer starts and if the voltage has not\nexceeded the V BO(start) , the T HV(stop)  timer is initiated. The\ntimer, T HV(stop) , typically 50 ms, is set long enough to ignore\na two cycle drop out. If the timer T HV(stop)  expires, abrownout condition is established and drive pulses are\nterminated. If the HV voltage is greater than V BO(start)  for\ntdelay(HV_start)  the T HV(stop)  timer  is reset and normal\noperation continues.

Some key features that are changed with linevoltage are: Over Power Protection (OPP) and current limit.\nPlease refer to appropriate sections for more information.\nThe controller compares a divided version of V\nHV to\ninternal line select thresholds.\nThe default power −up mode of the controller is low line.\nNo line changes are applied until after the soft start hascompleted and soft start wait or the forced ACF period hasended to ensure a repeatable reliable soft start free fromglitches. Once soft start wait has completed, the system is\nfree to apply changes to parameters based on line voltage.\nOn each line cycle, the increasing voltage is sensed and thecontroller updates the measured high voltage levelcontinuously which is used to determine slope and levels.The HV detector uses internal comparators and a divideddown version of the HV voltage to digitally track theprogress of the line as it increases and decreases. During the\nfirst line cycle measured, the HV detector increases the\nmaximum values it measures upon each increasing voltage\nreference trip level. The values will continue to be updateduntil the maximum voltage is reached. The HV detector will\ncontinue to measure voltages as they decrease. When the HV\ndetector measures a 2 level decrease, it knows a maximum\nwas detected. The internal digital detection then holds the\ncurrent value and adds 2 levels to obtain the peak value. The\nnew value is then referred to as the Held Maximum HVValue (HMHVV). To update the HMHVV , the peakmeasurement current HV Value (CHVV) must be repeatedtwice. If a large increase or decrease in voltage occurs, theHV detector is only allowed to increment or decrement theHMHVV one level every 32 ms. An analog front filter of\n253 /C0109s t\ndelayline  is used to ensure glitches high or low are not\nused to change levels. Note that some line dependentfunctions use the CHVV and some functions use theHMHVV , please refer to the appropriate section for thevalue used.\nLine Removal\nOnce line removal is detected switching is stopped since\nmany functions of the active clamp flyback are determinedfrom the line voltage. The IC will proceed to the wait statesimilar to other faults and remain there until AC voltage isreapplied or VCC voltage falls below V\nCC(reset) .\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n16Figure 9.

Peak current mode\ncontrol simplifies the loop compensation and typically willresult in a simple Type II compensator. With relativelysimple compensation schemes, aggressive bandwidths can\nbe achieved compared to a standard voltage mode control.\nFurther, current mode control inherently provides currentlimiting while also providing a line feed forward, resultingin excellent line transient response. However, peak currentmode control is susceptible to subharmonic oscillation forduty cycles greater than 50%. Subharmonic oscillation ischaracterized by alternating narrow and wide pulse widths.\nTo prevent subharmonic oscillation, NCP1568 also featuresadditional slope compensation.\nThe NCP1568 features multi −mode operation to optimize\nefficiency across line and load conditions. Below are themodes of operation:\n1. Active Clamp Operation with Variable Frequency2. Transition into and out of ACF Operation from\nDCM Operation\n3. Discontinuous Conduction Mode with Frequency\nFoldback\n4. Skip Mode\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n17Multi Mode Algorithm\nMulti mode algorithm is implemented in the NCP1568 to\noptimize the efficiency across load conditions. Themagnetizing current is in Continuous Conduction Mode\n(CCM) in active clamp operation. Therefore, when the\npower supply is in standby condition, the active clampflyback topology will work at high peak currents and theprimary side clamp FET along with the main FET will form\na synchronous buck boost structure with magnetizingcurrent traversing both the first and the third quadrants.If an IC were to remain in the ACF operation in all line and\nload conditions, the result would be high peak currentsleading to high conduction losses, core losses, and copper\nlosses while achieving ZVS as the load decreases. At light\nload, ZVS will not offset the three large loss contributors and\nthe efficiency will be lower compared to DCM operation.\nFigure 10.

Typically, for an active clampflyback topology, minimum frequency is selected to be at its\nlowest input voltage, lowest intended output voltage, andmaximum load current.\nAn internal amplifier forces 2 V on the RT pin and the\ncurrent sourced from the resistor on the RT pin is used by the\ninternal oscillator to set the minimum switching frequency.The frequency set by the RT resistor follows Equation 4\nnoted below:\nFOSC/C00431\nRT/C0064100 pF/C0179100 kHz /C00431\n100 k /C0087/C0064100 pF(eq. 4)\nwhere F OSC  is the frequency set by the RT resistor value\nThe frequency programmed at the RT pin sets the minimum\nACF switching frequency.

Minimum ACF Operating Oscillator Frequency vs. RT\nOn and Off Time Restrictions\nThe NCP1568 has an internally set minimum off time of\n590 ns that is always imposed in ACF mode. The minimumoff time is to ensure that enough time remains in eachswitching cycle to fully execute a successful high side pulse.\nThe minimum off time is constant, but the IC also has a\nmaximum duty cycle of approximately 78% to allow for\nrecharging of the high side driver boot capacitance and toavoid transformer saturation. The maximum duty cycle istherefore not constant, as the minimum off time must bemaintained to continue ACF operation past a certain\noperating frequency. With a constant off time of 590 ns, the\nmaximum duty cycle is governed by the minimum off time\npast 400 kHz. The resulting frequency versus duty cycle plot\nis shown in Figure 12.

The negative current needed for ZVS is\ntypically in the order of −0.5 A for super junction FETs. The\ncurrent could be lower for wide bandgap semiconductorssuch as gallium nitride (GaN) as their COSS is typicallylower. Keeping the negative magnetization currentrelatively constant is accomplished digitally by adjusting the\nfrequency of the oscillator until the SW node fall time ismodulated to a pre determined dead time across line and load\nconditions.\nA time reference T_ZVS is internally programmed in the\nNCP1568 and an error signal is accumulated based on thetime the switch node takes to fall from the falling edge ofADRV to the sensing of ZVS at the switch node by the ZVScomparator. If the switch node decreases quickly and ZVSoccurs before the reference time T_ZVS, then there is more\nthan enough energy to reset the node and therefore the\nfrequency of operation should be increased which\neffectively reduces the off time. The increased frequencywill result in less energy available for resetting the switchnode, and as such will result in less required on time for the\nlow side switch and a smaller /C0068 IM. The smaller /C0068 IM results\nin fewer losses in the system. If the switch node ZVS occurs\ncoincident with the time reference T_ZVS, no frequency\nadjustment is necessary. If the ZVS occurs after the T_ZVS,\nthe frequency is too high and needs to be reduced to ensuregood ZVS. Finally, if the ZVS never occurs and insteadreaches a maximum allowable time limit (D\nT_Max ), the\ncurrent switching cycle ends and the LDRV is driven on, but\nthe frequency reduction will be applied to the followingswitching cycle.\nThe net result is that the duty ratio would be maintained,\nthe load current would be supported, and the frequencywould adjust with load to provide enough energy to achieve\nZVS.  The TZVS is composed of 2 internally programmable\ntimes T_ZVS_A and TZVS_B. T_ZVS_A is half of theD\nT_Max  time. The T_ZVS_A is a course adjustment to the\ntotal T_ZVS time.  The T_ZVS_B is a fine adjustment to the\ntotal T_ZVS time. See part number decode for available\noptions. T_ZVS it the addition of T_ZVS_A and T_ZVS_B\nas shown below.\nFigure 13.

Themaximum oscillator frequency is 1/2 of the minimumfrequency set by the RT resistor. A frequency foldbackproportional to the FB pin is also implemented in the DCM\nmode. Please refer to the frequency foldback section for a\ndescription.\nFrequency Foldback\nThe combination of mandated agency standby power and\nlight load efficiency targets at various load points\nnecessitates the need to change the frequency of operation\nwhen the IC is in DCM mode. In DCM operation, thefrequency is the highest once the FB reaches a settable V\nDTH\nthreshold. The frequency of operation is reduced as FB\nvoltage falls to its lowest point at the V FB(skip)  skip\nthreshold. Since the DCM to ACF threshold isprogrammable, the VCO must change slopes based on theselected V\nDTH  threshold as shown in Figure 14. In frequency\nfoldback mode, the NCP1568 works with peak current,setting the main switch on time and employing variable\nfrequency control from the V\nTH_DCM_ACF  threshold to the\nVFB(Ipk_freeze)  threshold for the outer loop. Once the FB\nvoltage reaches V FB(Ipk_freeze)  on the FB pin, the peak\ncurrent floor is frozen to the V CS( Ipk_freeze)  value. The IC\ncan produce a peak current that is greater than the V CS(\nIpk_freeze)  if the PWM comparator requires a longer on time\nto satisfy the control loop. Freezing the peak current to aminimum value accelerates the slope of the frequency\nfoldback. The peak current is frozen and the oscillator\nfrequency is changed to maintain output voltage regulation.\nAs the load decreases, the frequency will keep decreasinguntil it stops at the minimum frequency clamp of F\nOSC(min)\n31 kHz. The minimum frequency occurs at the V FB(skip)\nthreshold, typically at 400 mV on the FB pin. At this\nthreshold, skip cycle operation is enabled.\nFigure 14. VCO Frequency Change with V DTH Voltage SelectionSKIP\nVFB\n0.8 V3.2VFSW/2\n VCO = FSW/(2x0.8V)\n VCO = FSW/(2x3.2V)\nDCM Minimum Frequency Clamp and Skip Mode\nThe minimum switching frequency clamp prevents the\nswitching frequency from dropping below F OSC(min)\n(31 kHz typical). When the switching cycle is longer than\n40/C0109s, a new switching cycle is initiated. Since the NCP1568\nforces a minimum peak current and a minimum frequency,\nthe power delivery cannot be continuously controlled to zero\nload. Instead, the circuit starts skipping pulses when the FB\nvoltage drops below the skip level, V FB(skip) , and recovers\noperation when V FB exceeds V FB(skip)  + V FB(skip)_hys . The\nskip mode method provides an efficient method of controlduring light loads.DCM TO ACF Transition (ADRV Soft Start)\nOnce all of the criteria to transition from DCM to ACF\noperation have been met, the NCP1568 soft starts the ADRV\nemploying Leading Edge Modulation (LEM). The ADRVsoft start slowly discharges the energy stored in the clampcapacitor in DCM operation to the output. During the ADRV\nsoft start time, T\nDCM_ACF_Trans , ADRV pulses will increase\nfrom a minimum of approximately 250 ns to 1 −D in a\ncontrolled progression.\nFigure 15 shows leading edge modulation of ADRV\nduring the DCM to ACF transition. The secondary currentshape starts to resemble that of resonant current during theLEM period and eventually resonant current can be seenthroughout the 1 −D cycle as the ADRV soft start finishes.\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n21 \nFigure 15.

During the start of LEM, the switch nodedemagnetization is interrupted by the switch node pulling up\nto the clamp capacitor voltage. The time the switch node is\npulled up to the clamp capacitor voltage steadily increases\nand the demagnetization switch node signature continues toincrease the amplitude of resonation. Either the LEMfinishes with no ringing to ground and is in full ACF modeof operation, or the switch node is clamped on a falling edgering to ground by the body diode of the low side FET. When\nthe body diode of the low side FET is conducting, turning onthe high side switch creates a disturbance to the system,\ndrains the energy in the clamp capacitor, and causes large\nspikes on the primary and secondary side of the transformer.ACF to DCM Transition (ADRV Soft Stop)\nIn ACF operation, if the FB voltage is below the externally\nset DTH for T ACF_DCM_HOLD , then the system will start the\ntransition from ACF switching to DCM switching usingLEM. During the T\nACF_DCM_trans  time, the active clamp\nFET (ADRV) duty cycle is decreased in a controlled fashion\nover multiple cycles. At the same time, a non −linear\nfrequency foldback to half the frequency (1/2*F osc) set by\nthe RT resistor is also implemented.\nA leading edge modulation technique is employed to soft\nstop the active clamp FET. The soft stop time\nTACF_DCM_trans  is typically around 500 /C0109s, a diagram of the\nsoft stop is shown in Figure 17.\n>>>>>\nLeading Edge\nModulation>>>>> ACF Slow Ramp\nSW\nSecondary CurrentUpper Slow Ramp\nThreshold\nLower Slow Ramp\nThresholdLast Pulses\nAre ≈ 250 ns\n>>>>> >>>>>\n>>>>> >>>>>LDRVADRV\nFigure 17.

OnceV\nCC has exceeded the V CC(on) threshold, the DTH pin will\nbegin sourcing 16 /C0109A. The size of the capacitor placed on the\nATH pin governs the delay the designer will see before the\npin reaches its steady state voltage. A 100 nF capacitance isthe standard recommended value for noise cancellation and\ntiming. The resistance range that will be applied to the DTH\npin can range from 0 /C0087 to 187.5 k /C0087 to set a voltage threshold\nbetween 0 V and 3 V. The most common anticipated ACF to\nDCM thresholds are shown in Figure 20. The DTH currentsource is turned off in DCM operation.\nVDTH/C0043IDTH * RDTH\nFigure 20.

Before the first pulses of the LDRV areinitiated, the FB voltage is held high by the internal pull up\ncurrent source and resistor tied to an internal 5 V source.\nDuring normal operation, the optocoupler and currentsources regulate the FB node, but in soft start it is notregulated until the output voltage is greater than thesecondary side reference voltage and the forward diode drop\nof the optocoupler. The IC will want to transition to ACFmode immediately on the first switching pulse, as the FBvoltage will be higher than any threshold that can be set by\nthe ATH pin. The IC’s natural tendency is to transition to\nACF operation when heavy loads are applied to the output.Thus, all of the criteria are met to enter the ACF soft start,but the boot pin for the high voltage level shifter and driveris not charged. The NCP1568 works in DCM operation for\nthe first part of the soft start T\nDCM_SS  (typically 706 /C0109s) to\nmake sure that the boot capacitor is char ged. During the soft\nstart, the PWM pulse width is gradually increased by\nramping the internal current limit reference to its final value.After T DCM_SS , the IC slowly increases the ADRV on time\nvia the LEM process . Once the internal current limit reaches\nits maximum value, the IC then operates in ACF mode. The\nIC must wait for an additional time referred to as\nTMODE_Sam  (typically, twice the soft start time), to allow the\noutput voltage to reach regulation and the FB node tostabilize . After T\nMODE_Sam  expires, the ACF detection\ncircuits and logic are no longer manipulated, but are allowed\nto transition as the output load requires to achieve optimal\nfrequency.\nForced DCM\nThe forced DCM operation allows a sufficient number of\nlow side pulses to charge the high side drivers, bootcapacitor, and to allow the driver sufficient time to perform\ninternal startup sequences. The maximum current provided\nto the output for the first few switching cycles is regulated\nby the minimum on time. Minimum on time is a sum of LEB,\npropagation delay of CS comparator, gate drive, and the FET\nturn off. To reduce primary and secondary start up currentstress, the frequency is ramped to half the oscillator\nfrequency set by RT during T\nDCM_SS  typically 706 /C0109s.\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n250V\n0VADRVLDRV\n0Hz\nVOUTDCM/ACF\nLogic ReleaseFrequency\nTDCM _ACF _transTsoft_start31 kHzFOSC/2FOSC\nTMODE _sampleCS\nTDCM _SS\nFigure 21. Duty Cycle and Frequency Modulation\nSlope Compensation\nFixed frequency peak current mode control architecture is\nprone to subharmonic oscillation for duty cycles greater than\n50%. Subharmonic oscillations are typically characterizedby observing the SW node alternating wide and narrowpulse widths. An additional compensating ramp, if either\nadded to the sensed inductor current or subtracted from the\nloop error voltage (FB), will prevent the subharmonicoscillations. In a flyback topology employing current mode\ncontrol, the slope of this stabilizing ramp also known asslope compensation, is proportional to the down slope of the\npower converter (duty cycle greater than 50%). Theminimum amount of slope compensation to negate theoscillation is equal to 1/2 the down slope. However, for\ndead band compensation, the ramp is equal to the down\nslope. Note that with higher slope compensation, the power\nconverter’s ac characteristics will start resembling that ofvoltage mode control. Slope compensation is set to\n143 mV/ /C0109s.Feedback Pin\nThe FB pin is equipped with a 100 /C0109A pullup current\nsources and a 100 k /C0087 resistor. The pullup current source and\nresistor work in conjunction with the optocoupler to regulate\nthe system output voltage.\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n26VDD VOUT\nFBRFB IFB\nFigure 22. FB Resistor and Current Pullup Diagram\nLow Side Driver\nThe low side driver is a ground based driver and is suitable\nfor direct driving high capacitance switches, as its sourcingcurrent is I\nLS_src  (typically 1.3 A) resulting in a rise time of\nTLS_rise  (typically 10.7 ns) with a 1.5 nF load. No additionalpull down circuitry is needed as the sinking current I LS_snk\n(typically 2.5 A) results in a fall time of T LS_fall  (typically\n6.5 ns) with a 1.5 nF load. The low side driver is also\nequipped with an internal clamp V LDRV(low)  (typically\n11.75 V) to  prevent the voltage on the gate from exceeding\nthe maximum rating if the V CC voltage of the controller\nincreases beyond 20 V and to minimize losses in the system.\nThe IC draws I CC3 (typically 3.9 mA) when the IC is\nswitching both LDRV and ADRV drivers at 500 kHz with100 pF load, but increases to I\nCC4 and I CC5 when fully\nloaded at 100 kHz and 500 kHz to 4.0 mA and 13 mA,\nrespectively with a 1.5 nF load.\nActive Clamp Driver\nThe Active Clamp Driver ADRV ground based driver is\nsuitable for sending 5 V logic square wave signals to a high\nside driver with a built in level shifter to modulate the on\ntime of the active clamp FET. The drive with 95 mA of\nsourcing current and 231 mA of sinking current is alsosufficient to drive a pulse transformer.\nFigure 23.

The dead time for the active clamp topology can\nbe described by first identifying the two modes of operationof the switch node (SW) or bridge node. When the topology\nis actively clamping and the SW is high, current can flow\ninto and out of the clamp capacitor. The time that the energy\nis stored and recycled in the clamp capacitor is referred to asthe resonant mode and is identified with a high voltage onthe switch node. During the resonant mode, the high sideFET or body diode is conducting. When the low side FET is\nconducting, the SW is near ground potential when theprimary inductor current has a positive slope, and is referred\nto as energy storage mode. The magnetizing inductance\ncurrent is ramped up during the energy storage mode untilthe low side drive transitions from high to low. The switchnode is then pulled high by the circulating currents. The rate\nat which the SW changes voltage is dependent on the voltagecontrolled parasitic capacitance of the selected FETs at thebridge node, the primary current, the magnetizinginductance, the leakage inductance, and other factors. Since\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n27many of the governing factors determining the rise and fall\ntime of the switch node are design specific, an active deadtime control circuitry must be employed to optimize\nefficiency for a wide range of applications. During the\nenergy storage to resonant mode SW node transition, themajority of the transition time is spent charging therelatively large C\nOSS capacitance of the low side FET when\nthe SW node is near ground potential and the C OSS\ncapacitance of the high side FET as the SW node nears theclamp voltage. The resulting slope of the voltage change atlow voltages is in the order of 100 MV/s. Once the switch\nnode has started to charge the C\nOSS, the capacitance\ndecreases rapidly and the slope can increase on the switchnode to as much as 10 GV/s. The active dead time controlstarts a timer once the LDRV internal logic has transitioned\nfrom TTL logic level high to low referred to as D\nT_Max . The\nDT_Max  is a fail safe dead timer that ensures normal\noperation. After the low side driver logic transition istripped, the part will monitor the voltage at SW to determine\nwhen it has exceeded 10 V . Once the 10 V threshold is\nexceeded, a second timer is started called DT_E_R. After theDT_E_R timer has expired, the ADRV will generate a 5 V\nlogic level high to turn on the high side FET so that the high\nside FET will start conducting. If the D\nT_Max  timer expires\nbefore the 10 V threshold is met, and the additional DT_E_R\ntimer has not expired, this failure will be counted, but theADRV will not be forced on. Once the SW is high and thehigh side FET is conducting, the high side drive will remain\nhigh until the end of the cycle. At the end of the cycle, theADRV will output a 5 V logic level low. When the internalprelevel shifted ADRV TTL logic transitions from high tolow, a D\nT_Max  timer is started. The switch node then\ndischarges until it reaches DT_R_E_TH, at which time the\nDT_R_E timer is started. Once either the DT_R_E or theD\nT_Max  timer has expired, the LDRV will transition from\nlow to high and the process will continue. The dead timeD\nT_Max  only applies to the full ACF mode of operation and\nas such is blanked from ACF to DCM and DCM to ACFtransitions when the ADRV pulses are phased in and out with\nLEM. Further, D\nT_Max  is not observed during the LEM\nportion of soft start of ACF.\nResonant ModeVHOVLO\nVBRIDGEDT_R_EDT_Max\nBegin\nDT_E_R\nVINDT_R_EDT_Max\nBeginDT_Max\nBegin\nEnergy Storage\n10 V 10 V\nFigure 24.

The controller can be latched off or restarted\nby pulling the pin up above the upper fault threshold(typically 3.0 V). Likewise, the controller can be latched offor restarted if the FLT pin voltage, V\nFLT, is pulled below the\nlower fault threshold (typically 0.4 V).

FLT Pin Diagram\nOTP FLT Threshold and Fault Handling\nThe primary purpose of the lower FLT threshold is to\ndetect an over temperature fault using an NTC thermistor. A\npull up current source, (typically 45.5 /C0109A) generates a\nvoltage drop across an external thermistor. The resistance of\nthe NTC thermistor decreases as the temperature rises,\nresulting in a lower voltage across the thermistor. The\ncontroller detects a fault once the thermistor voltage dropsbelow the V\nFLT(OTP_in)  threshold. The FLT voltage must\ndrop below the threshold for longer than t delay(OTP)\n(typically 33 /C0109s), then the IC will take the appropriate\naction. If the IC is programmed to latch, the V CC voltage\nmust go below Vcc(reset) before normal operation cancontinue. If the IC is programmed to restart, the part will\ninitiate a soft start once the temperature decreases and the\ncorresponding NTC voltage has increased enough to exceed\nthe V\nFLT(OTP_out)  threshold (typically 937 mV).OTP FLT Threshold Startup\nA bypass capacitor is usually connected between the FLT\nand GND pins and it will take some time for VFLT to reachits steady state value once IFLT(OTP) is enabled. The IC isprevented from switching as long as the FLT voltage isbelow the V\nFLT(OTP_in)  threshold. When adapters are\nproduced they must go through a burn in process. The\nprocess calls for the adapter to be heated up to higherambient temperatures (typically 65 °C), then powered on and\nallowed to operate for an extended period of time to catchany assembly or part defects early before they are shippedto end customers. With the above burn in process, the FLTpin can cause the NTC to trip and keep the part off during the\nburn in process. To prevent the adapter from failing the burn\nin test, the adapter must start up when the FLT voltage\nexceeds V\nFLT(OTP_out_1st)  (typically 418 mV), rather than\nVFLT(OTP_out)  (typically 937 mV). Further, the IC must\nsuccessfully complete a soft start by reaching the end offorced ACF without triggering a V\nCC off as shown in\nFigure 26.\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n29VFLT(OTP_in)VFLT(OTP_out) 0.920 V\n0.40 VFirst\nSoft StartN\nSoft Starts\nOFF ON ON OFF ON\nFigure 26. FLT Pin Diagram\nThe IC is enabled above V FLT(OTP_out_1st)  in soft start\nonly, rather than V FLT(OTP_out).  The rest of the functionality\nof the FLT pin after a successful soft start is unchanged.\nTherefore, a lower fault (i.e. over temperature) is\nacknowledged under the V FLT(OTP_out_1st)  threshold in soft\nstart, holding the part in reset until the threshold is clear.When the FLT pin is below the V\nFLT(OTP_in)  threshold, the\ncurrent draw of the IC is I CC1A  (typically 240 /C0109A).\nOVP FLT Threshold\nThe upper fault threshold is intended to be used to prevent\nan overvoltage using a zener diode and a resistor in seriesfrom the auxiliary winding voltage (V\nAUX) to ground with\nthe FLT pin connected at the anode as shown in Figure 25.To reach the upper threshold, the external pull up current hasto be greater than the pull down capability of the clamp V\nFLT\n(clamp)  (typically 1.75 V) and R FLT (clamp)  (typically\n1.57 k /C0087) the resistor in series. The FLT voltage must\nincrease above the threshold for longer than t delay(OTP)\n(typically 33 /C0109s), then the IC will take the appropriate action\nof latching or restarting. If the IC is programmed to latch, theV\nCC voltage must go below V CC(reset)  before normal\noperation can continue. If the IC is programmed to restart,the part will initiate the restart timer once V\nAUX  voltage\ndecreases below the hysteresis of the OVP comparator. The\ninternal clamp prevents the FLT pin voltage from reachingthe upper latch threshold if the pin is open. When the FLT pin\nis above the V\nFLT(OVP)  threshold, the current draw of the IC\nis ICC1B  (typically 240 /C0109A).\nWhen the auto recovery option is selected for the fault pin,\nIFLT(OTP)  remains enabled while the lower fault is present\nindependent of V CC in order to provide temperature\nhysteresis. The controller can detect an upper OVP fault\nonce V CC exceeds V CC(reset).  Once the controller is latched,\nit is reset if a brownout condition is detected or if V CC is\ncycled down to its reset level, V CC(reset) . In the typical\napplication these conditions occur only if the ac voltage isremoved from the system.Over Power Protection\nThe maximum power delivered by an isolated power\nconverter is controlled by limiting the peak inductor current\non a pulse by pulse basis on the primary side. Powerconverters typically do not deliver the same maximumoutput power across all line conditions. Energy delivery is\ninfluenced by duty ratio, line voltage, and switching\nfrequency. The duty ratio changes with line voltage andhence with a fixed peak current, the average inductor current\nvaries over line voltage. The slope of the current increasesas the line voltage increases, delivering more energy with afixed propagation delay in high line operation. An internalline OPP compensation is provided where line senseddiscrete steps provide an approximate transconductance\n(g\nm) of 188 nA/V sourced out of the CS pin such that a\ndesigner can compensate for the selected inductance. Thepropagation delays of all comparators connected to the CSpin such as SCP, OCP, peak current freeze, and the PWMcomparator all benefit from the line compensation.\nCurrent Limit\nThe current passing through the primary main FET is\nsensed via a resistor at the CS pin. The ramping currentsensed by the CS pin is used to modulate the loop errorvoltage (FB) to generate PWM signals; it is also used forcycle by cycle peak current limit control and detection of ashort circuit condition. Figure 27 below shows the blockdiagram of the current limit circuitry.\nInternal Leading Edge Blanking (LEB) circuitry masks\nthe current sense information before applying it to thecurrent monitoring comparators. LEB prevents unwantednoise from terminating the drive pulses prematurely. Placing\na small RC filter (typically 20 pF and 732 /C0087) close to the CS\npin to suppress additional noise is suggested. The LEBperiod begins once LDRV reaches approximately 2 V . Aninternal switch R\nCS(switch)  discharges and holds the CS pin\nlow at the conclusion of every cycle for 100 ns. In DCM\noperation, LEB is implemented by pulling the CS pin low for\nthe LEB period at the beginning of LDRV pulse.\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n30Restart\nOR\nLatch\nRestart\nOR\nLatchOCP LEB\nSCP LEBSCP Comparator\n(Abnormal OCP)PWM STOPCS\nLEM & Line\nLogicS1\nS8D\nC 1 ENB C3C2Multiplexer\nS1\nS2DC ENB\nM1OCP\nComparator_++_nOVLD\nnAbnormalV(OCP)_DCM\nV(OCP)_ACF\nV(OCP)_trans\nVILIM(SCP)\nV(SCP)_trans\nFigure 27. Current Limit Comparators\nCycle by Cycle Current Limiting\nCycle by Cycle (CBC) current limiting is implemented\nusing the OCP comparator and terminates the LSDRV drive\npulse if the CS voltage exceeds the V ILIM  (OCP)  threshold in\nACF and DCM modes of operation. In transition mode ofoperation this threshold is raised to V\nILIM  (OCP)  Trans  to\nfacilitate the increased /C0068Im while transitioning into or  out of\nACF operation. When the CS voltage crosses the V ILIM\n(OCP) , an error flag is asserted and the counter counts up 2\ncounts. If a single cycle occurs in which the V ILIM  (OCP)  is\nnot triggered,  the counter counts down 1 count. The counter\nupdate is done at switching frequency. Hence dependingupon the mode of operation (ACF vs. DCM) and line andload conditions, the time it takes to reach full count varies.\nIf the counter has reached full count, a latch or auto recoveris initiated dependent on options selected referred to as OCP\nreaction.\nThe OCP threshold depends on mode of operation, i.e.,\nDCM versus ACF and frequency pf operation. In the DCMoperation, the OCP threshold is 784 mV . However, in ACF\noperation, the OCP comparator trip voltage varies with thefrequency of operation from V\n(OCP)_ACF_C1_100  to\nV(OCP)_ACF_C1_400 , this feature is implemented to\ncompensate for higher frequency of operation in a variable\nenvironment. Please refer to the electrical table for\nfrequency vs OCP level.\nTable 6.

Current Limit Counting Scheme\nShort Circuit Protection\nA sharp rise in the CS pin sensed current can occur in the\nprimary side if a winding is shorted or a component is faulty.\nShort circuit protection is implemented using the SCP\ncomparator; it terminates the drive pulse if the CS voltage\nexceeds the V ILIM  (SCP)  threshold in ACF, DCM, and skip\nmode of operation after the T LEB(SCP)  blanking time.  The\ntime T LEB(SCP)  is shorter than the T LEB(OCP)  byapproximately 50 ns to ensure a short circuit is properly\nidentified. When the SCP comparator trips, a count isincremented and a counter tracks the number of SCP events.\nOnce the number of consecutive SCP events crosses N\nSCP\nas defined in the electrical table, then the part latches or\nrestarts according to the OTP bits programmed referred to as\nSCP reaction.\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n31OCP and SCP Level During Transition\nThe OCP and SCP have two discrete voltage trip levels at\nan operating point. In ACF mode, the current limit ismodulated with frequency change. The NCP1568 ZVSfrequency modulation scheme increases the frequency as the\nline voltage increases. The current limit must be decreased\nto compensate for the increased available output power\nwhen the voltage and frequency increases. The SCP andOCP levels described in the above section are steady statenormal protections. When the system is transitioning fromACF operation to DCM operation or DCM operation to ACFoperation via the LEM process described in the\ncorresponding sections, the current limits are changed.When the system is under going the transition, the OCP and\nSCP levels are increased from the V\n(OCP)_ACF_100100\n(784 mV at low line) to the V ILIM(OCP)_Trans  1.2 V and the\nVILIM(SCP)  1.2 V to V ILIM(SCP)_Trans  1.4 V . The current\nlimit levels are increased on the rising edge of the first lowside drive pulse of the transition and remain at that level for\n1 ms after the transition process has completed, as shown inFigure 29.\n0V\n0VADRVLDRV\nFrequency\nDCM TO ACF\nLEMFOSC/2FOSCOCP\nACF TO DCM\nLEMACF DCM DCM1m s1m sSCP\nFigure 29. OCP and SCP Timing\nHV Bias Cycle (HVBC)\nWhen the IC is not switching due to a fault condition and\nis either waiting for restart or in latched state the IC’s VCCpower is maintained by sourcing I\nstart2 from the HV pin to\nthe VCC pin. The V CC pin is charged to the V CC(on)\nthreshold, at which time it will turn off. The part dissipates\na small amount of power monitoring critical nodes and\ntracking restart timers while waiting to take the next action.\nThe standby current slowly discharges the V CC pin voltage\nuntil the V CC(off)  threshold is tripped. Once the V CC(off)\nthreshold is tripped, the part will source I start2, charging the\nVCC capacitor to maintain critical functions. The charging\nand discharging of the V CC voltage, also referred to as HV\nBias Cycle (HVBC), will continue until the HV pin’ s voltage\nis removed, the V CC voltage drops below V CC(reset) ,\nTauto_retry  has expired, or AC voltage is applied.Auto Recovery and Latch\nThe auto recovery fault behavior is used to protect the end\nuser from any abnormal conditions, to reduce powerconsumption during a fault condition, and to allow theadapter to recover quickly as soon as the issue has beenresolved without the need to unplug and replug the power\nsupply. If a fault occurs when the IC is configured to auto\nrecovery, ADRV and LDRV are driven low and the partremains off for T\nauto_retry  time maintaining V CC voltage\nthrough the HVBC process. At the end of T auto_retry , the IC\nis allowed to restart via the soft start process once V CC(on)\nis reached.\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n32Fault\nVCC\nDRVVCC (on )\nVCC (off )Fault Applied\nAutorecovery\nTimer\nTauto _retryController\nStopsFault Removed\nRestarts\nAt V CC(on)\n(new bias\ncycle if fault is\nstill present)\nTauto _retry\nFigure 30. Fault Recovery Behavior\nLatching Fault Behavior\nThe purpose of a latch fault is to require user intervention\nto restore proper operation of the adapter or power supply.The user is expected to unplug and replug the adapter to\nenable the power supply to attempt regulation. If a fault\noccurs and the NCP1568 is configured to have a latch faultin ACF operation or DCM operation once the current clockcycle expires, both LDRV and ADR V are terminated. In skipoperation since there are no pulses, no pulses will be\nproduced as a result of a latch fault. The part then monitors\nthe line to determine when power has been removed and\nmaintains V\nCC voltage by HVBC. When line voltage has\nbeen removed, the part will stop switching (see the lineremoval section). When the FLT pin initiates a latch fault,\nthe current draw of the IC is I\nCC1C  (typically 220 /C0109A).\nNCP1568\nwww. onsemi.com\n33Time\nTime\nTimeDRVLatch Event\nLatch\nTime\nFigure 31.
