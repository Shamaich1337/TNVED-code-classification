Each device in the family is stable, with\na small 1- µF ceramic capacitor on the output. The\nfamily uses an advanced, proprietary BiCMOSfabrication process to yield extremely low dropoutvoltages (e.g., 55 mV at 100 mA, TPS79230).Each device achieves fast start-up times\n(approximately 50 µs with a 0.001  µF bypass\ncapacitor) while consuming very low quiescentcurrent (170 µA typical). Moreover, when the\ndevice is placed in standby mode, the supplycurrent is reduced to less than 1 µA. The\nTPS79228 exhibits approximately 27 µV\nRMS of\noutput voltage noise with a 0.1  µF bypass\ncapacitor. Applications with analog componentsthat are noise sensitive, such as portable RFelectronics, benefit from the high PSRR and lownoise features as well as the fast response time.\n10 100 1 k 10 k205090\n100 k 1 M 10 MRipple Rejection – dB\nf – Frequency – HzTPS79228\nRIPPLE REJECTION\nvs\nFREQUENCY\nIO = 10 mA60\n0VI = 3.8 V\nCo = 10 µF\nC(byp) = 0.01 µFIO = 100 mA\n1030407080\nf – Frequency – Hz1k 10k 100kIO = 1 mAVI = 3.8 V\nCo = 1 µF\nC(byp) = 0.1 µF\n100IO = 100 mATPS79228\nOUTPUT SPECTRAL NOISE DENSITY\nvs\n FREQUENCY\n00.050.10.150.20.250.3\n32\n45DBV PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\n1IN\nGND\nENOUT\nBYPASS\nFixed Option\n32\n46DBV PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\n1IN\nGND\nENOUT\nBYPASS5FB\nAdjustable Option\nV/Hz Output Spectral Noise Density – µ\nPRODUCTION DATA information is current as of publication date.

The device features extremely low dropout voltages, high PSRR, ultralow output noise, low quiescent current(170 µA typically), and enable-input to reduce supply currents to less than 1 µA when the regulator is turned off.\nA typical application circuit is shown in Figure 22.\n0.1 µFBYPASS\nOUT1\n3IN\nEN\nGND\n24\n5VI\nVO\n1 µF+TPS792xx\n0.01 µF\nFigure 22. Typical Application Circuit\nEXTERNAL CAPACITOR REQUIREMENTS\nA 0.1-µF or larger ceramic input bypass capacitor, connected between IN and GND and located close to the TPS792xx,\nrequired for stability and to improve transient response, noise rejection, and ripple rejection. A higher-value electrolytic in put\ncapacitor may be necessary if large, fast-rise-time load transients are anticipated and the device is located several inches\nfrom the power source.\nLike all low dropout regulators, the TPS792xx requires an output capacitor connected between OUT and GND to stabilize\nthe internal control loop. The minimum recommended capacitance is 1 µF. Any 1 µF or larger ceramic capacitor is suitable.\nThe device is also stable with a 0.47 µF ceramic capacitor with at least 75 m Ω of ESR.\nThe internal voltage reference is a key source of noise in an LDO regulator. The TPS792xx has a BYPASS pin which is\nconnected to the voltage reference through a 250-k Ω internal resistor. The 250-k Ω internal resistor, in conjunction with an\nexternal bypass capacitor connected to the BYPASS pin, creates a low pass filter to reduce the voltage reference noise\nand, therefore, the noise at the regulator output. In order for the regulator to operate properly, the current flow out of theBYPASS pin must be at a minimum because any leakage current  creates an IR drop across the internal resistor thuscreating an output error. Therefore, the bypass capacitor must have minimal leakage current.\nFor example, the TPS79228 exhibits only 31 µV\nRMS of output voltage noise using a 0.1- µF ceramic bypass capacitor and\na 1-µF ceramic output capacitor. Note that the output starts up slower as the bypass capacitance increases due to the RC\ntime constant at the bypass pin that is created by the internal 250-k Ω resistor and external capacitor.\nBOARD LAYOUT RECOMMENDATION TO IMPROVE PSRR AND NOISE PERFORMANCE\nTo improve ac measurements like PSRR, output noise, and transient response, it is recommended that the board be\ndesigned with separate ground planes for V IN and VOUT, with each ground plane connected only at the ground pin of the\ndevice. In addition, the ground connection for the bypass capacitor should connect directly to the ground pin of the device.\nTPS79201, TPS79225\nTPS79228, TPS79230\nSLVS337B – MARCH 2001 – REVISED MAY 2002www.ti.com\n9POWER DISSIPATION AND JUNCTION TEMPERATURE\nSpecified regulator operation is assured to a junction temperature of 125 °C; the maximum junction temperature should be\nrestricted to 125 °C under normal operating conditions. This restriction limits the power dissipation the regulator can handle\nin any given application. To ensure the junction temperature is within acceptable limits, calculate the maximum allowable\ndissipation, P D(max), and the actual dissipation, P D, which must be less than or equal to P D(max).\nThe maximum-power-dissipation limit is determined using the following equation:\nPD(max)/C0043TJmax/C0042TA\nRθJA\nWhere:\nTJmax is the maximum allowable junction temperature.\nRθJA is the thermal resistance junction-to-ambient for the package, see the dissipation rating table.\nTA is the ambient temperature.(1)\nThe regulator dissipation is calculated using:\nPD/C0043/C0466VI/C0042VO/C0467/C0032IO(2)\nPower dissipation resulting from quiescent current is negligible. Excessive power dissipation triggers the thermal protection\ncircuit.\nPROGRAMMING THE TPS79201 ADJUSTABLE LDO REGULATOR\nThe output voltage of the TPS79201 adjustable regulator is programmed using an external resistor divider as shown inFigure 23. The output voltage is calculated using:\nVO/C0043Vref/C0032/C04661/C0041R1\nR2/C0467 (3)\nWhere:\nVref = 1.2246 V typ (the internal reference voltage)\nResistors R1 and R2 should be chosen for approximately 50- µA divider current. Lower value resistors can be used for\nimproved noise performance, but the solution consumes more power. Higher resistor values should be avoided as leakagecurrent into/out of FB across R1/R2 creates an offset voltage that artificially increases/decreases the feedback voltage andthus erroneously decreases/increases V\nO. The recommended design procedure is to choose R2 = 30.1k Ω to set the\ndivider current at 50 µA, C1 = 15 pF for stability, and then calculate R1 using:\nR1/C0043/C0466VO\nVref/C00421/C0467/C0032R2 (4)\nIn order to improve the stability of the adjustable version, it is suggested that a small compensation capacitor be placed\nbetween OUT and FB.  For voltages <1.8 V, the value of this capacitor should be 100 pF. For voltages >1.8 V, the\napproximate value of this capacitor can be calculated as:\nC1/C0043(3 x 10–7)x( R 1 /C0041R2)\n(R1 x R2)(5)\nThe suggested value of this capacitor for several resistor ratios is shown in the table below. If this capacitor is not used\n(such as in a unity-gain configuration) or if an output voltage < 1.8 V is chosen, then the minimum recommended outputcapacitor is 2.2 µF instead of 1 µF.\nTPS79201, TPS79225\nTPS79228, TPS79230\nSLVS337B – MARCH 2001 – REVISED MAY 2002www.ti.com\n10OUTPUT VOLTAGE\nPROGRAMMING GUIDE\nVOVI\nOUT\nFBR1\nR2GNDENIN\n≤0.7 V≥2 VTPS79201\n1 µF\nBYPASS\n0.01 µF1 µFC1 22 pF\n15 pF15 pFOUTPUT\nVOLTAGER1 R2\n2.5 V\n3.3 V3.6 VC1\n33.4 kΩ\n53.6 kΩ\n59 kΩ30.1 kΩ\n30.1 kΩ\n30.1 kΩ\nFigure 23. TPS79201 Adjustable LDO Regulator Programming\nREGULATOR PROTECTION\nThe TPS792xx PMOS-pass transistor has a built-in back diode that conducts reverse current when the input voltage drops\nbelow the output voltage (e.g., during power down). Current is conducted from the output to the input and is not internallylimited. If extended reverse voltage operation is anticipated, external limiting might be appropriate.\nThe TPS792xx features internal current limiting and thermal protection. During normal operation, the TPS792xx limits\noutput current to approximately 400 mA. When current limiting engages, the output voltage scales back linearly until the\novercurrent condition ends. While current limiting is designed to prevent gross device failure, care should be taken not toexceed the power dissipation ratings of the package or the absolute maximum voltage ratings of the device. If thetemperature of the device exceeds approximately 165 °C, thermal-protection circuitry shuts it down. Once the device has\ncooled down to below approximately 140 °C, regulator operation resumes.\nPACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM\nwww.ti.com 18-Aug-2022\nPACKAGING INFORMATION\nOrderable Device Status\n(1)Package Type Package\nDrawingPinsPackage\nQtyEco Plan\n(2)Lead finish/\nBall material\n(6)MSL Peak Temp\n(3)Op Temp (°C) Device Marking\n(4/5)Samples\nTPS79201DBVR ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 63000RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEVISamples\nTPS79201DBVT ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 6250RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEVISamples\nTPS79201DBVTG4 ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 6250RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEVISamples\nTPS79225DBVR ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 53000RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEXISamples\nTPS79225DBVT ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 5250RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEXISamples\nTPS79225DBVTG4 ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 5250RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEXISamples\nTPS79228DBVR ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 53000RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEWISamples\nTPS79228DBVRG4 ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 53000 TBD Call TI Call TI -40 to 125Samples\nTPS79228DBVT ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 5250RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEWISamples\nTPS79230DBVR ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 53000RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEYISamples\nTPS79230DBVRG4 ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 53000RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEYISamples\nTPS79230DBVT ACTIVE SOT-23 DBV 5250RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PEYISamples\n \n(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:\nACTIVE: Product device recommended for new designs.\nLIFEBUY:  TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.\nNRND: Not recommended for new designs.
