It has dual supplies (V CC(A)  and V CC(B) ) for voltage translation. It also has a\ndata input (A), four data outputs (1Yn and 2Yn) and an output enable input ( OE). VCC(A)\nand V CC(B)  can be independently supplied at any voltage between 0.8 V and 3.6 V.\nIt makes the device suitable for low voltage translation between any of the following\nvoltages: 0.8 V, 1.2 V, 1.5 V, 1.8 V, 2.5 V and 3.3 V. The levels of A, OE and 1Yn are\nreferenced to V CC(A) , outputs 2Yn are referenced to V CC(B) . This supply configuration\nensures that two of the fanned out signals can be used in level shifting. A HIGH on OE\ncauses all outputs to be pulled LOW via pull-down resistors, a LOW on OE disconnects\nthe pull-down resistors and enables all outputs.\nSchmitt trigger action at all inputs makes the circuit tolerant for slower input rise and fall\ntime.\nThe I OFF circuitry disables the output, preventing any damaging backflow current through\nthe device when it is powered down.\n2Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range:\n–VCC(A) : 0.8 V to 3.6 V\n–VCC(B) : 0.8 V to 3.6 V\n•Complies with JEDEC standards:\n–JESD8-12 (0.8 V to 1.3 V)\n–JESD8-11 (0.9 V to 1.65 V)\n–JESD8-7 (1.2 V to 1.95 V)\n–JESD8-5 (1.8 V to 2.7 V)\n–JESD8-B (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•ESD protection:\n–HBM ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-001 Class 3B exceeds 8 kV\n–CDM JESD22-C101E exceeds 1000 V\n•Maximum data rates:\n–380 Mbit/s (≥ 1.8 V to 3.3 V translation)\n–200 Mbit/s (≥ 1.1 V to 3.3 V translation)\n–200 Mbit/s (≥ 1.1 V to 2.5 V translation)\n–200 Mbit/s (≥ 1.1 V to 1.8 V translation)\n–150 Mbit/s (≥ 1.1 V to 1.5 V translation)\n–100 Mbit/s (≥ 1.1 V to 1.2 V translation)\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78 Class II\n•Inputs accept voltages up to 3.6 V\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\nNexperia74AVC1T1022\n1-to-4 fan-out buffer\n74AVC1T1022 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2017.

#### Description:
The **74AVC1T1022** is a **1-to-4 fan-out buffer** designed for clock distribution applications. It features dual supplies (VCC(A) and VCC(B)) that allow for voltage translation between various logic levels, making it suitable for interfacing between different voltage domains. The device has a single data input (A) and four data outputs (1Yn and 2Yn), with an output enable input (OE) that controls the output states.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Clock Distribution:** The device is ideal for distributing clock signals across different voltage levels in digital circuits.
- **Level Shifting:** It can be used to translate signals between different voltage levels, which is essential in mixed-voltage systems.
- **Signal Integrity Improvement:** The Schmitt trigger inputs help maintain signal integrity by providing noise immunity, making it suitable for high-speed applications.
- **Data Communication:** The buffer can be utilized in data communication systems where multiple outputs are required from a single input.

This component is particularly useful in applications where low voltage operation and high-speed signal processing are critical, such as in mobile devices, consumer electronics, and communication equipment.
