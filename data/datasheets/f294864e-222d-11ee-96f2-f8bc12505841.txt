Figure 7 is u sed to illustrate this concept; V CC  (or V BS ) is plotted over time and \nas the waveform crosses the UVLO threshold (V CCUV+/k  or V BSUV+/k ) the undervoltage protection is enabled or disable d. \n \nUpon powerkup, should the V CC  voltage fail to reach the V CCUV+  threshold, the IC will not turnkon.  Additionally,  if the \nVCC  voltage decreases below the V CCUVk threshold during operation, the undervoltage locko ut circuitry will recognize a \nfault condition and shutdown the highk and lowkside  gate drive outputs.   \n \nUpon powerkup, should the V BS  voltage fail to reach the V BSUV  threshold, the IC will not turnkon.  Additionally,  if the \nVBS  voltage decreases below the V BSUV  threshold during operation, the undervoltage locko ut circuitry will recognize a \nfault condition, and shutdown the highkside gate dr ive outputs of the IC. \n \nThe UVLO protection ensures that the IC drives the external power devices only when the gate supply vo ltage is \nsufficient to fully enhance the power devices.  Wit hout this feature, the gates of the external power switch could be \ndriven with a low voltage, resulting in the power s witch conducting current while the channel impedanc e is high; this \ncould result in very high conduction losses within the power device and could lead to power device fai lure. \n \n \nFigure 7: UVLO protection \n \n \n IRS21867S  \n                      \n \nwww.irf.com © 2010 International Rectifier \n13  Tolerant to Negative V S Transients \n \nA common problem in today’s highkpower switching co nverters is the transient response of the switch no de’s voltage \nas the power switches transition on and off quickly  while carrying a large current.  A typical 3kphase  inverter circuit is \nshown in Figure 8; here we define the power switche s and diodes of the inverter.  \n \nIf the highkside switch (e.g., the IGBT Q1 in Figur es 9 and 10) switches off, while the U phase curren t is flowing to an \ninductive load, a current commutation occurs from h ighkside switch (Q1) to the diode (D2) in parallel with the lowkside \nswitch of the same inverter leg.  At the same insta nce, the voltage node V S1 , swings from the positive DC bus voltage \nto the negative DC bus voltage.   \n \n \nFigure 8: Three phase inverter \n \nQ1\nON \nD2VS1\nQ2\nOFF IUDC+ BUS \nDCk BUS   \nFigure 9: Q1 conducting  Figure 10: D2 conducting \n \nAlso when the V phase current flows from the induct ive load back to the inverter (see Figures 11 and 1 2), and Q4 \nIGBT switches on, the current commutation occurs fr om D3 to Q4. At the same instance, the voltage node , V S2 , \nswings from the positive DC bus voltage to the nega tive DC bus voltage.  \n \n IRS21867S  \n                      \n \nwww.irf.com © 2010 International Rectifier \n14    \nFigure 11: D3 conducting  Figure 12: Q4 conducting \n \nHowever, in a real inverter circuit, the V S voltage swing does not stop at the level of the ne gative DC bus, rather it \nswings below the level of the negative DC bus. This  undershoot voltage is called “negative V S transient”. \n \nThe circuit shown in Figure 13 depicts one leg of t he three phase inverter; Figures 14 and 15 show a s implified \nillustration of the commutation of the current betw een Q1 and D2. The parasitic inductances in the pow er circuit from \nthe die bonding to the PCB tracks are lumped togeth er in L C and L E for each IGBT.  When the highkside switch is on, \nVS1 is below the DC+ voltage by the voltage drops asso ciated with the power switch and the parasitic elem ents of the \ncircuit.  When the highkside power switch turns off , the load current momentarily flows in the lowksid e freewheeling \ndiode due to the inductive load connected to V S1 (the load is not shown in these figures).  This cu rrent flows from the \nDCk bus (which is connected to the COM pin of the H VIC) to the load and a negative voltage between V S1 and the \nDCk Bus is induced (i.e., the COM pin of the HVIC i s at a higher potential than the V S pin). \n \n   \nFigure 13: Parasitic Elements Figure 14: V S positive Figure 15: V S negative \n \nIn a typical motor drive system, dV/dt is typically  designed to be in the range of 3k5 V/ns. The negat ive V S transient \nvoltage can exceed this range during some events su ch as short circuit and overkcurrent shutdown, when  di/dt is \ngreater than in normal operation. \n \nInternational Rectifier’s HVICs have been designed for the robustness required in many of today’s dema nding \napplications. An indication of the IRS21867’s robus tness can be seen in Figure 16, where there is repr esented the \nIRS2 1867 Safe Operating Area at V   BS  =15V based on repetitive negative V  S  spikes. A negative V S transient voltage \nfalling in the grey area (outside SOA) may lead to IC permanent damage; viceversa unwanted functional anomalies \nor permanent damage to the IC do not appear if negative Vs transients fall inside SOA.  \n \n IRS21867S  \n                      \n \nwww.irf.com © 2010 International Rectifier \n15   \n \nFigure 16: Negative V S transient SOA for IRS2607 @ VBS=15V  \n \nEven though the IRS21867 has been shown able to han dle these large negative V S transient conditions, it is highly \nrecommended that the circuit designer always limit the negative V S transients as much as possible by careful PCB \nlayout and component use. \n \nPCB Layout Tips \n \nDistance between high and low voltage components:   It’s strongly recommended to place the components  tied to the \nfloating voltage pins (V B and V S) near the respective high voltage portions of the device.  Please see the Case \nOutline information in this datasheet for the detai ls. \n \nGround Plane:  In order to minimize noise coupling, the ground pl ane should not be placed under or near the \nhigh voltage floating side.  \n \nGate Drive Loops:  Current loops behave like antennas and are able to  receive and transmit EM noise (see \nFigure 17). In order to reduce the EM coupling and improve the power switch turn on/off performance, t he \ngate drive loops must be reduced as much as possibl e. Moreover, current can be injected inside the gat e \ndrive loop via the IGBT collectorvtovgate parasitic  capacitance. The parasitic autovinductance of the gate \nloop contributes to developing a voltage across the  gatevemitter, thus increasing the possibility of a  self \nturnvon effect.  \n \n IRS21867S  \n                      \n \nwww.irf.com © 2010 International Rectifier \n16  \n \nFigure 17: Antenna Loops \n \nSupply Capacitor:   It is recommended to place a bypass capacitor (C IN ) between the V CC  and COM pins. A \nceramic 1 µF ceramic capacitor is suitable for most  applications.  This component should be placed as close \nas possible to the pins in order to reduce parasiti c elements. \nRouting and Placement:   Power stage PCB parasitic elements can contribute  to large negative voltage \ntransients at the switch node; it is recommended to  limit the phase voltage negative transients.  In o rder to \navoid such conditions, it is recommended to 1) mini mize the highvside emitter to lowvside collector di stance, \nand 2) minimize the lowvside emitter to negative bu s rail stray inductance.  However, where negative V S \nspikes remain excessive, further steps may be taken  to reduce the spike.  This includes placing a resi stor (5 \nΩ or less) between the V S pin and the switch node (see Figure 18), and in so me cases using a clamping \ndiode between COM and V S (see Figure 19).
