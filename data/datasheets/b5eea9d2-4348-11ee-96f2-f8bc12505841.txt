Logic inputs are comp atible \nwith standard CMOS or LSTTL output, down to 3.0V logic. \nThe output drivers feature a high pulse current buffer stage \ndesigned for minimum driver cross -conduction. Propagation \ndelays are matched to simplify use in high frequency \napplications. The flo ating channel can be used to drive an N -\nchannel power MOSFET or IGBT in the high side \nconfiguration which operates up to 200 volts.
