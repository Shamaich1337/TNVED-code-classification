The part operates from a single 2.50 V to \n5.5 V power supply and features throughput rates up to 100   kSPS. \nThe part contains a low noise, wide bandwidth track -and-hold \namplifie r that can handle input frequencies in excess of 7 MHz.  \nThe conversion process and data acquisition are controlled  \nusing CS and the serial clock, allowing the devices to interface \nwith microprocessors or DSPs. The input signal is sample d on \nthe falling edge of CS and the conversion is also initiated at this \npoint. There are no pipelined delays associated with the part.  \nThe AD7940 uses advanced design techniques to achieve very low power dissipation at fast throughput ra tes. The reference for \nthe part is taken internally from V\nDD, which allows the widest \ndynamic input range to the ADC. Thus, the analog input range for this part is 0 V to V\nDD. The conversion rate is determined by \nthe SCLK frequency.  \n \n \n1Protected by US. Pa tent No. 6,681,332.   \nThis part features a standard successive approximation ADC \nwith accurate control of the sampling instant via a CS input and \nonce off conversion control.  \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS  \n1. First 14 -bit ADC in a SOT -23 pa ckage.  \n2. High t hroughput with low power consumption.  \n3. Fl\nexible power/serial clock speed management. The \nconv\nersion rate is determined by the serial clock, allowing \nthe conversion time to be reduced through the serial clock \nspeed increase. This allows the average power con sumption \nto be reduced when a power -down mode is used while not \nconverting. The part also features a shutdown mode to \nmaximize power efficiency at lower throughput rates. Power consumption is 0.5 µA max when in shutdown.  \n4. Reference derived from the power su ppl\n y. \n5. No pipeline delay.  \n \n \n  AD7940\n \n TABLE OF CONTENTS \nTable of Contents .............................................................................. 2 \xa0\nSpecifications ..................................................................................... 3 \xa0\nTiming Specifications ....................................................................... 5 \xa0\nAbsolute Maximum Ratings ............................................................ 6 \xa0\nESD Caution .................................................................................. 6 \xa0\nPin Configurations and Function Descriptions ........................... 7 \xa0\nTerminology ...................................................................................... 8 \xa0\nTypical Performance Characteristics ............................................. 9 \xa0\nCircuit Information ........................................................................ 11 \xa0\nConverter Operation .................................................................. 11 \xa0\nAnalog Input ............................................................................... 11 \xa0\nADC Transfer Function ................................................................. 12 \xa0\nTypical Connecti on Diagram ................................................... 12 \xa0\nModes of Operation ....................................................................... 13 \xa0Normal Mode .............................................................................. 13 \xa0\nPower-Down Mode .................................................................... 14 \xa0\nPower vs. Throughput Rate ........................................................... 15 \xa0\nSerial Interface ................................................................................ 16 \xa0\nMicroprocessor Interfacing ........................................................... 17 \xa0\nAD7940 to TMS320C541 .......................................................... 17 \xa0\nAD7940 to ADSP-218x .............................................................. 17 \xa0\nAD7940 to DSP563xx ................................................................ 18 \xa0\nApplication Hints ........................................................................... 19 \xa0\nGrounding and Layout .............................................................. 19 \xa0\nEvaluating the AD7940 Performance ...................................... 19 \xa0\nOutline Dimensions ....................................................................... 20 \xa0\nOrdering Guide .......................................................................... 20 \xa0\n \n \nREVISION HISTORY \n8/11—Rev. 0 to Rev.

A | Page 8 of 20 TERMINOLOGY \nIntegral Nonlinearity  \nThis is the maximum deviation from a straight line passing \nthrough the endpoints of the ADC transfer function. The \nendpoints of the transfer function are zero scale, a point 1/2  \nLSB below the first code transition, and full scale, a point 1/2 \nLSB above the last code transition.  \nDifferential Nonlinearity  \nThis is the difference between the measured and the ideal 1 LSB \nchange between any two adjacent codes in the ADC.  \nOffset Error  \nThis is the deviation of the first code transition (00 . . . 000) to (00 . . . 001) from the ideal, i.e., AGND + 1 LSB. \nGain Error  \nThis is the deviation of the last code transition (111 . . . 110) to \n(111 . . . 111) from the ideal (i.e., V\nREF − 1 LSB) after the offset \nerror has been adjusted out.  \nTrack -and-Hold Acquisition Time  \nThe track -and-hold amplifier returns to track mode at the end \nof conversion. The track -and-hold acquisition time is the time \nrequired for the output of the track -and-hold amplifier to reach \nits final value, within ±1 LSB, after the end of the conversion. See the Serial Interface  section for more details.  \nSignal -to-(Noise + Distortion) Ratio  \nThis is the measured ratio of signal -to-(noise + distort ion) at \nthe output of the ADC. The signal is the rms amplitude of the \nfundamental. Noise is the sum of all nonfundamental signals up to half the sampling frequency ( f\nS/2, excluding dc). The ratio \ndepends on the number of quantization levels in the digitiza tion \nprocess; the more levels, the smaller the quantization noise. The theoretical signal -to-(noise + distortion) ratio for an ideal N -bit \nconverter with a sine wave input is given by  \nSignal -to-(Noise + Distortion ) = (6.02 N + 1.76) dB  \nThus, for a 14 -bit c onverter, this is 86.04 dB.  \n Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)  \nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of harmonics to the fundamental. For the AD7940, it is defined as  \n12\n62\n52\n42\n32\n2\nVV V V V Vlog 20 (dB)+ + + += THD  \nwhere V1 is the rms amplitude of the fundamental and V2, V3, \nV4, V5, and V6 are the rms amplitudes of the second through the \nsixth harmonics.  \nPeak Harmonic or Spurious Noise  \nPeak harmonic or spurious noise is defined as the ratio of the rms value of the next largest component in the ADC output spectrum (up to f\nS/2, excluding dc)  to the rms value of the \nfundamental. Normally, the value of this specification is determined by the largest harmonic in the spectrum, but for ADCs where the harmonics are buried in the noise floor, it will be a noise peak.  \nIntermodulation Distortion  \nWith inputs consisting of sine waves at two frequencies, fa and fb, \nany active device with nonlinearities will create distortion products at sum and difference frequencies of mfa ± nfb where m , \nn = 0, 1, 2, 3. Intermodulation distortion terms are those for \nwhic h neither m  nor n are equal to zero. For example, the second -\norder terms include (fa + fb) and (fa − fb), while the third -order \nterms include (2fa + fb), (2fa − fb), (fa + 2fb), and (fa −2fb).  \nThe AD7940 is tested using the CCIF standard where two input frequencies near th e top end of the input bandwidth are used. \nIn this case, the second -order terms are usually distanced in \nfrequency from the original sine waves, while the third -order \nterms are usually at a frequency close to the input frequencies. As a result, the second - and third -order terms are specified \nseparately. The calculation of the intermodulation distortion is as per the THD specification where it is the ratio of the rms sum of the individual distortion products to the rms amplitude of the sum of the fundamental s expressed in dBs. \n \n  AD7940 \n \nRev.

A | Page 11 of 20 CIRCUIT INFORMATION \nThe AD7940 is a fast, low power, 14- bit, single -supply ADC. \nThe part can be operated from a 2.50 V to 5.5 V supply. When \noperated at either 5 V or 3 V supply, the AD7940 is capable of \nthroughput rates of 100 kSPS when provided with a 2.5 MHz \nclock.  \nThe AD7940 provides the user with an on -chip track -and-hold \nADC and a serial interface housed in a ti ny 6-lead SOT -23 \npackage or in an 8 -lead MSOP package, which offer the user \nconsiderable space -saving advantages over alternative solutions. \nThe serial clock input accesses data from the part and also \nprovides the clock source for the successive approximat ion \nADC. The analog input range for the AD7940 is 0 V to VDD. An \nexternal reference is not required for the ADC nor is there a \nreference on -chip. The reference for the AD7940 is derived from \nthe power supply and thus gives the widest dynamic input range.  \nThe AD7940 also features a power -down option to save power \nbetween conversions. The power -down feature is implemented \nacross the standard serial interface as described in the Modes of Operation  section.  \nCONVERTER OPERATION  \nThe AD7940 is a 14- bit, successive approximation ADC based \naround a capacitive DAC. The AD7940 can convert analog  \ninput signals in the 0 V to VDD range. Figure 11 and Figure 12 \nshow simplified schematics of the ADC . The ADC comprises of \ncontrol logic, SAR, and a capacitive DAC. Figure 11 shows the \nADC during its acquisition phase. SW2 is closed and SW1 is in Position A. The comparator is held in a balanced condition and the sampling capacito r acquires the signal on the selected V\nIN \nchannel.  \n03305-0-004CAPACITIVE\nDAC\nCONTROL\nLOGICSAMPLING\nCAPACITOR\nCOMPARATORACQUISITION\nPHASEA\nBSW1\nVDD/2SW2VIN\n \nFigure 11. ADC Acquisition Phase \nWhen the ADC starts a conversion, SW2 will open and SW1 will move to Position B, causing the comparator to become  \nunbalanced ( Figure 12). The control logic and the capacitive \nDAC are used to add and subtract fixed amounts of charge  \nfrom the sampling capacitor to bring the comparator back into a balanced condition. When the comparator is rebalanced, the conversion is compl ete.

Care must be taken to \nensure that the analog input signal never exceeds the supply \nrails by more than 300 mV . This will cause these diodes t o \nbecome forward -biased and to start conducting current into the \nsubstrate. The maximum current these diodes can conduct without causing irreversible damage to the part is 10 mA. Capacitor C1 in Figure 13 is typically about 5 pF a nd primarily \ncan be attributed to pin capacitance. Resistor R1 is a lumped component made up of the on resistance of a switch (track -and-\nhold switch). This resistor is typically about 25 Ω. Capacitor C2 is the ADC sampling capacitor and has a capacitance of 25 pF \ntypically. For ac applications, removing high frequency \ncomponents from the analog input signal is recommende d by \nuse of an RC low -pass filter on the relevant analog input pin. In \napplications where harmonic distortion and signal -to-noise \nratio are critical, the analog input should be driven from a low impedance  source. Large source impedances will significantly \naffect the ac performance of the ADC. This may necessitate the use of an input buffer amplifier. The choice of the op amp will be a function of the particular application. When no amplifier is used to drive the analog input, the source impedance should be limited to low values. The maximum source impedance will \ndepend on the amount of total harmonic distortion (THD) that \ncan be tolerated. The THD will increase as the source impedance increases, and performance will degrade (see Figur e 8). 03305-0-006R1C2\n30pF\nCONVERSION PHASE - SWITCH OPEN\nTRACK PHASE - SWITCH CLOSEDVINVDD\nC1\n4pFD1\nD2\n \nFigure 13.

AD7940 Transfer Characteristic \nTYPICAL CONNECTION D IAGRAM  \nFigure 15 shows a typ ical connection diagram for the AD7940. \nVREF is taken internally from VDD and as such should be well \ndecoupled. This provides an analog input range of 0 V to VDD. \nThe conversion result is output in a 16 -bit word. This 16 -bit \ndata stream consists of two lea ding zeros, followed by the 14 \nbits of conversion data, MSB first. For applications where power consumption is a concern, the power -down mode should be \nused between conversions or bursts of several conversions to improve power performance (see the Modes of Operation   \nsection).  In fact, because the supply current required by the AD7940 is so low, a precision reference can be used as the supply source to the AD7940. For example, a REF19x voltage reference (REF195 for 5 V or REF193 for 3 V) or an AD780 can be used to supply the required voltage to the ADC (see Figure 15). This \nconfiguration is especially useful if the power supply available is quite noisy, or if the system supply voltages are at some value \nother than the required operating voltage of the AD7940, e.g., \n15 V . The REF19x or AD780 will output a steady voltage to the \nAD7940.  Recommended decoupling capacitors are a 100 nF low \nESR ceramic (Farnell 335 -1816) and a 10 µF low ESR tantalum \n(Farnell 197 -130).  \n03305-0-008AD79400V TO V DD\nINPUTVINSCLK\nSDATA\nSERIAL\nINTERFACEµC/µP\nCSVDD\nGND10µF\nTANT0.1µF3V\n10µF 0.1µF5V\nSUPPLYREF193\n \nFigure 15. Typical Connection Diagram  \nDigital Inputs  \nThe digital inputs applied to the AD7940 are not limited by the \nmaximum ratings that limit the analog inputs. Instead, the \ndigital inputs applied can go to 7 V and are not restricted by the  V\nDD + 0.3 V limit as on the analog inputs. For example, if the \nAD7940 were operated with a VDD of 3 V , 5 V logic levels could \nbe used on the digital inputs. However, it is important to note that the data output on SDATA will still have 3  V logic levels \nwhen V\nDD =  3  V.  \nAnother advantage of SCLK and CS not being restricted by the \nVDD + 0.3 V limit is the fact that power supply sequencing issues \nare avoided. If one of these digital inputs is applied before VDD, \nthere is no risk of latch -up as there would be on the analog  \ninputs if a signal greater than 0.3 V were applied prior to VDD. \n \n \n  AD7940 \n \nRev. A | Page 13 of 20 MODES OF OPERATION \nThe mode of operation of the AD7940 is selected by controlling \nthe (logic) state of the CS signal du ring a conversion. There are \ntwo possible modes of operation, normal and power -down. The \npoint at which CS is pulled high after the conversion has been \ninitiated will determine whether or not the AD7940 will enter power -down mode. Similar ly, if already in power -down, \nCS can \ncontrol whether the device will return to normal operation or \nremain in power -down. These modes of operation are designed \nto provide flexible power management options. These options can optimize the po wer dissipation/throughput rate ratio for \ndiffering application requirements.  \nNORMAL MODE  \nThis mode provides the fastest throughput rate performance because the user does not have to worry about the power -up \ntimes with the AD7940 remaining fully powered al l the time. \nFigure 16 shows the general diagram of the operation of the \nAD7940 in this mode.  The conversion is initiated on the falling edge of \nCS as  \ndescribed in the Serial Interface  section. To ensure that the part \nremains fully powered up at all times, CS must remain low until \nat least 10 SCLK falling edges have elapsed after the falling edge \nof CS. If CS is brought high any time after the 10th SCLK falling \nedge, but before the 16th SCLK falling edge, the part will \nremain powered up, but the conversion will be terminated and \nSDATA will go back into three -state. At least 16 serial clock \ncycles are required to complete the conversion and access the \ncomplete conversion result. CS may idle high until the next \nconversion or may idle low until CS returns high sometime \nprior to the next conversion, effectively idling CS low. \nOnce a data transfer is complete (SDATA has returned to three-\nstate), another conversion can be initiated after the quiet time, \ntQUIET , has elapsed by bringing CS low again. \n \n03305-0-0091 12 16\n1 LEADING ZERO + CONVERSION RESULTCS\nSCLK\nSDATA \nFigure 16. Normal Mode Operation  \n \n  AD7940 \n \nRev. A | Page 14 of 20 POWER -DOWN M ODE \nThis mode is intended for use in applications where slower \nthroughput rates are required. Either the ADC is powered down \nbetween each conversion, or a series of conversions may be  \nperformed at a high throughput rate, and then the ADC is powered down for a relatively long duration between these \nbursts of several conversions. When the AD7940 is in power -\ndown, all analog circuitry is powered down.  \nTo enter power -down, the conversion process must be \ninterrupted by bringing \nCS high anywhe re after the second \nfalling edge of SCLK and before the 10th falling edge of SCLK \nas shown in Figure 17. Once CS has been brought high in this \nwindow of SCLKs, the part will enter power -down, the  \nconversion that was initiated by the falling edge of CS will be \nterminated, and SDATA will go back into three -state. If CS is \nbrought high before the second SCLK falling edge, the part will \nremain in normal mode and will not power down.  This will \navoid accidental power -down due to glitches on the CS line.  In order to exit this mode of operation and power up the AD7940 again, a dummy conversion is performed. On the \nfalling edge of \nCS, the device will b egin to power up and will  \ncontinue to power up as long as CS is held low until after the \nfalling edge of the 10th SCLK. The device will be fully powered \nup once at least 16 SCLKs (or approximately 6 µs) have elapsed and valid data will r esult from the next conversion as shown in \nFigure 18. If CS is brought high before the 10th falling edge of \nSCLK, regardless of the SCLK frequency, the AD7940 will go back into power -down again. This avoids accide ntal power -up \ndue to glitches on the \nCS line or an inadvertent burst of 8 SCLK \ncycles while CS is low. So although the device may begin to \npower -up on the falling edge of CS, it will power down again on  \nthe rising edge of CS as long as it occurs before the 10th SCLK \nfalling edge.  \n \n03305-0-010SCLK\nSDATA1 2 10 16\nTHREE-STATECS\n \nFigure 17.

THROUGHPUT  RATE  \nBy using the power -down mode on the AD7940 when not  \nconverting, the average power consumption of the ADC  \ndecreases at lower throughput rates. Figure 19 shows how as the \nthroughput rate is reduced, the part remains in its shutdown state longer, and the average power consumption over time drops accordingly.  \nFor example, if the AD7940 is operated in a continuous sampling mode, with a throughput rate of 10 kSPS and an SCLK of 2.5 MHz (V\nDD = 3.6 V), and the device is placed in power -\ndown  mode between conversions, the power consumption is \ncalculated as follows. The maximum power dissipation during normal operation is 6.84 mW (V\nDD = 3.6 V). If the power -up \ntime from power -down is 1 µs, and the remaining conversion \ntime is 6.4 µs, (using a 16 SCLK transfer), then the AD7940 can be said to dissipate 6.84 mW for 7.4 µs during each conversion cycle. With a throughput rate of 10 kSPS, the cycle time is 100 µs. For the remainder of the conversion cycle, 92.6 µs, the part remains in power -down mode. The AD7940 can be said to \ndissipate 1.08 µW for the remaining 92.6 µs of the conversion \ncycle. Therefore, with a throughput rate of 10 kSPS, the average power dissipated during each cycle is  \n(7.4/100) × (6.84 mW) + (92.6/100) × (1.08 µW) = 0.51 mW  Figure 19 shows the power dissipation versus the throughput \nrate when using the power -down mode with 3.6 V supplies and \na 2.5 MHz SCLK.  \n03305-0-012POWER (mW)\n0.01\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nTHROUGHPUT (kSPS)30 35 40 45 500.1110VDD = 3.6V\nFSCLK  = 2.5MHz\n \nFigure 19.

A | Page 16 of 20 SERIAL INTERFACE  \nFigure 20 shows the detailed timing diagram for serial \ninterfacing to the AD7940. The serial clock provides the \nconversion clock and also controls the transfer of information \nfrom the AD7940 during c onversion.  \nThe CS signal initiates the data transfer and conversion process. \nThe falling edge of CS puts the track -and-hold into hold mode, \ntakes the bus out of three -state, and samples the analog input. \nThe conversion i s also initiated at this point and will require at \nleast 16 SCLK cycles to complete. Once 15 SCLK falling edges \nhave elapsed, the track -and-hold will go back into track mode \non the next SCLK rising edge as shown in Figure 20 at Poi nt B. \nOn the 16th SCLK falling edge, the SDATA line will go back \ninto three -state. If the rising edge of CS occurs before 16 SCLKs \nhave elapsed, the conversion will be terminated and the SDATA \nline will go back into three -state; otherwise  SDATA returns to \nthree -state on the 16th SCLK falling edge as shown in Figure 20.  \nSixteen serial clock cycles are required to perform the \nconversion process and to access data from the AD7940. CS \ngoing low provi des the first leading zero to be read in by the microcontroller or DSP . The remaining data is then clocked out \nby subsequent SCLK falling edges beginning with the second \nleading zero, thus the first falling clock edge on the serial clock \nhas the first lead ing zero provided and also clocks out the \nsecond leading zero. The data transfer will consist of two leading zeros followed by the 14 bits of data. The final bit in the data transfer is valid on the 16th falling edge, having been \nclocked out on the previou s (15th) falling edge.  \nIt is also possible to take valid data on each SCLK rising edge \nrather than falling edge, since the SCLK cycle time is long enough to ensure the data is ready on the rising edge of SCLK. \nHowever, the first leading zero will still be  driven by the \nCS \nfalling edge, and so it can be taken only on the first SCLK \nfalling edge. It may be ignored, and the first rising edge of SCLK \nafter the CS falling edge would have the second leading zero \nprovided and t he 15th rising SCLK edge would have DB0 \nprovided. This method may not work with most \nmicrocontrollers/ DSPs, but could possibly be used with FPGAs \nand ASICs.  \n \n03305-0-013t4tCONVERT\n2 LEADING ZEROS3-STATE 3-STATEB\nSCLK1 2 3 4 5 13 14 15 16\nSDATA 0 ZERO DB13 DB12 DB11 DB10 DB2 DB1 DB0CS\nt2\nt3t6\nt7t5 t8\ntQUIET\n \nFigure 20.

A | Page 17 of 20 MICROPROCESSOR INT ERFACING \nThe serial interface on the AD7940 allows the part to be directly \nconnected to a range of many different microprocessors. This section explains how to interface the AD7940 with some of the \nmore common microcontroller and DSP serial interface  \nprotocols. \nAD7940 TO TMS320C541  \nThe serial interface on the TMS320C541 uses a continuous  \nserial clock and frame synchronization signals to synchronize the data transfer operations with peripheral devices such as the \nAD7940. The \nCS input all ows easy interfacing between the \nTMS320C541 and the AD7940 with no glue logic required. The \nserial port of the TMS320C541 is set up to operate in burst mode with internal CLKX (TX serial clock) and FSX (TX frame \nsync). The serial port control register (SPC ) must have the  \nfollowing setup:  \nFO = 0  \nFSM = 1  \nMCM = 1  \nTXM = 1  \nThe format bit, FO, must be set to 1 to set the word length to \n8 bits, in order to implement the power -down mode on the \nAD7940. The connection diagram is shown in Fig ure 21. It \nshould be noted that for signal processing applications, it is imperative that the frame synchronization signal from the TMS320C541 provide equidistant sampling.  \n03305-0-014AD7940* TMS320C541*\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYSDATA DR\nCS FSX\nFSRSCLK CLKX\nCLKR\n \nFigure 21. Interfacing to the TMS320C541  AD7940 TO ADS P-218 x \nThe ADSP -218x family of DSPs can be interfaced directly to the \nAD7940 with no glue logic required.

The DSP operates in alternate framing mode, and the SPORT control register is set up as described. The fr ame synchronization signal generated on \nthe TFS is tied to \nCS, and, as with all signal processing \napplications, equidistant sampling is necessary. In this example, the timer interrupt is used to control the sampling rate of the ADC.  \n03305-0-015SCLKAD7940*\nSDATA\nCSADSP-218x*\nSCLK\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYDR\nRFS\nTFS\n \nFigure 22. Interfacing to the ADSP -218x  \nThe timer register is loaded with a value that provides an  interrupt at the required sample interval. When an interrupt is received, the values in the transmit autobuffer start to be transmitte d and TFS is generated. The TFS is used to control \nthe  \nRFS and, therefore, the reading of data. The data is stored in the receive autobuffer for processing or to be shifted later. The frequency of the serial clock is set in the SCLKDIV register. When the instruction to transmit with TFS is given, i.e., TX0 = AX0, the state of the SCLK is checked. The DSP waits until the \nSCLK has gone high, low, and high before transmission will \nstart. If the timer and SCLK values are chosen such that the instruction to transmit occurs on or near the rising edge of SCLK, the data may be transmitted, or it may wait until the next clock edge.  \n  AD7940 \n \nRev. A | Page 18 of 20 For example, if the ADSP -2189 had a 20 MHz crystal, such that \nit had a master clock frequency of 40 MHz, the master cycle \ntime would be 25 ns. If the SCLKDIV register is loaded with the value 7, then a SCLK of 2.5 MHz is obtained, and 16 master clock periods will elapse for every 1 SCLK period. Depending on the throughput rate selected, if the timer register was loaded with the value 803 (803 + 1 = 804), then 50.25 SCLKs will occur \nbetween interrupts and subsequently between transmit \ninstruc tions. This situation will result in nonequidistant sam pling \nsince the transmit instruction is occurring on a SCLK edge. If the number of SCLKs between  interrupts is a whole integer figure of N, \nthen equidistant sampling will be implemented by the DSP .  AD7940 TO DSP563 xx \nThe connection diagram in Figure 23 shows how the AD7940 \ncan be connected to the ESSI (synchronous serial int erface) of \nthe DSP -563xx family of DSPs from Motorola. Each ESSI (two \non board) is operated in synchronous mode (SYN bit in CRB = 1) with internally generated 1 -bit clock period frame sync for \nboth Tx and Rx (Bits FSL1 = 0 and FSL0 = 0 in CRB). Normal oper ation of the ESSI is selected by making MOD = 0 in the \nCRB. Set the word length to 16 by setting bits WL1 = 1 and WL0 = 0 in CRA. The FSP bit in the CRB should be set to 1 so that the frame sync is negative. It should be noted that for signal processing ap plications, it is imperative that the frame \nsynchronization signal from the DSP -563xx provide equidistant  \nsampling. \nIn the example shown in Figure 23, the serial clock is taken from  \nthe ESSI so the SCK0 pin must be  set as an output, SCKD = 1.  03305-0-016SCLKAD7940*\nDOUT\nCSDSP-563xx*\nSCK\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYSRD\nSTD\n \nFigure 23.

A | Page 19 of 20 APPLICATION HINTS  \nGROUNDING AND LAYOUT \nThe printed circuit board that houses the AD7940 should be \ndesigned such that the analog and digital sections are se parated \nand confined to certain areas of the board. This facilitates the use of ground planes that can be separated easily. A minimum etch technique is generally best for ground planes, since it gives the best shielding. Digital and analog ground planes should be joined at only one place. If the AD7940 is in a system where multiple devices require an AGND to DGND connection, the connection should still be made at one point only, a star ground point that should be established as close as possible to the AD79 40. \nAvoid running digital lines under the device since these will couple noise onto the die. The analog ground plane should be allowed to run under the AD7940 to avoid noise coupling. The power supply lines to the AD7940 should use as large a trace as poss ible to provide low impedance paths and reduce the effects \nof glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals, such as clocks, should be shielded with digital ground to avoid radiating noise to other sections of the board, and clock signals \nshoul d never be run near the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of \ndigital and analog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the board \nshould run at right angles to each other, which will reduce the effects of feedthrough through the board. A microstrip technique is by far the best but is not always possible with a double -sided board. In this technique, the component side of \nthe board is dedicated to ground planes while the signals are placed on the solder side.  Good decoupling is also very important. All analog sup plies \nshould be decoupled with 10 µF tantalum in parallel with 0.1 µF capacitors to AGND, as discussed in the Typical Connection Diagram  section. To achieve the best performance from these \ndecoupling components, the user should att empt to keep the \ndistance between the decoupling capacitors and the V\nDD and \nGND pins to a minimum, with short track lengths connecting \nthe respective pins.  \nEVALUATING THE AD794 0 PERFORMANCE  \nThe recommended layout for the AD7940 is outlined in the evaluatio n board for the AD7940. The evaluation board \npackage includes a fully assembled and tested evaluation board, \ndocumentation, and software for controlling the board from the PC via the evaluation board controller. The evaluation board controller can be used in conjunction with the AD7940 evaluation board, as well as many other Analog Devices evaluation boards ending in the CB designator, to demonstrate/evaluate the ac and dc performance of the AD7940.  \nThe software allows the user to perform ac (fast Fourier transform) and dc (histogram of codes) tests on the AD7940. \nThe software and documentation are on a CD shipped with the evaluation board.  \n \n  AD7940\n \n OUTLINE DIMENSIONS \nCOMPLIANT TO JEDEC STANDARDS MO-178-AB10°\n4°\n0°SEATING\nPLANE1.90\nBSC0.95 BSC\n0.60\nBSC65\n12343.00\n2.90\n2.80\n3.002.80\n2.601.70\n1.60\n1.50\n1.301.150.90\n0.15 MAX\n0.05 MIN1.45 MAX0.95 MIN0.20 MAX0.08 MIN\n0.50 MAX0.30 MIN0.550.450.35PIN 1\nINDICATOR\n12-16-2008-A \nFigure 24. 6-Lead Small Outline Transistor Package [SOT-23] (RJ-6).
