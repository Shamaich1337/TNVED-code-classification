All GND pins must be connected.  \n3 to 10, 16 to  \n23, 41 to 48  G0 to G7,  \nB0 to B7,  \nR0 to R7  Red, Green, and Blue Pixel Data Inputs (TTL Compatible). Pixel data is latched on the rising edge of CLOCK. \nR0, G0, and B0 are the least significant data bits. Unused pixel data inputs should be connected to eit her the \nregular printed circuit board (PCB) power or ground plane.  \n11  BLANK  Composite Blank Control Input (TTL Compatible). A Logic 0 on this control input drives the analog outputs, \nIOR, IOB, and IOG, to the blanking level. The BLANK  signal is latched on the rising edge of CLOCK. While \nBLANK  is a Logic 0, the R0 to R7, G0 to G7, and B0 to B7 pixel inputs are ignored.  \n12  SYNC  Composite Sync Control Input (TTL Compatible). A Logic 0 on the SYNC  input switches off a 40 IRE current \nsource. This is internally connected to the IOG analog output. SYNC  does not override any other control or \ndata input; therefore, it should only be asserted during the bl anking interval. SYNC  is latched on the rising \nedge of CLOCK. If sync information is not required on the green channel, the SYNC  input should be tied to Logic 0.  \n13, 29, 30  VAA  Analog Power Supply (5 V ± 5%). All V AA pins on the ADV7125 must be connected.  \n24  CLOCK  Clock Input (TTL Compatible). The rising edge of CLOCK latches the R0 to R7, G0 to G7, B0 to B7, SYNC , and \nBLANK  pixel and control inputs. It is typically the pixel clock rate of the video system. CLOCK should be \ndriven by a dedicated TTL buffer.  \n27, 31, 33  IOB, IOG, \nIOR Differential Blue, Green, and Red  Current Outputs (High Impedance Current Sources). These RGB video \noutputs are specified to directly drive RS -343A and RS -170 video levels into a doubly terminated 75 Ω load. If \nthe complementary outputs are not required, these outputs should be tied to ground.  \n28, 32, 34  IOB, IOG, \nIOR Blue, Green, and Red  Current Outputs. These high impedance current sources are capable of directly driving \na doubly terminated 75 Ω coaxial cable. All three current outputs should have similar output loads whether or not they are all being used.  \n35  COMP  Compensation Pin. This is a compensation pin for the internal reference amplifier.

D | Page 12 of 17 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION  \nThe ADV7125 contains three 8 -bit DACs, with three input \nchannels, each containing an 8 -bit register. Al so integrated  \non board the device  is a reference amplifier. The CRT control \nfunctions, BLANK  and SYNC , are integrat ed on board the \nADV7125.  \nDIGITAL INPUTS  \nThere are 24 bits of pixel data (color information), R0 to R7,  \nG0 to G7, and B0 to B7, latched into the device on the rising \nedge of each clock cycle. Thi s data is presented to the three 8 -bit \nDACs and then converted to three analog (RGB) output wave -\nforms (see Figure 6). \nCLOCK\nDATADIGITAL INPUTS\n(R7 TO R0, G7 TO G0,\nB7 TO B0,\nSYNC, BLANK)\nANALOG OUTPUTS\n(IOR, IOR, IOG, IOG,\nIOB, IOB)\n03097-004 \nFigure 6. Video Data Input/Output  \nThe ADV7125 has two additional control signals that are  latched \nto the analog video outputs in a similar fashion. BLANK  and \nSYNC  are each latched on the rising edge of CLOCK to maintain \nsynchronization with the pixel data stream.  \nThe BLANK  and SYNC  functions allow for the encoding of \nthese video synchronization signals onto the RGB video output. \nThis is done by adding appropriately weighted current sources \nto the analog outputs, as determined by the logic levels on the \nBLANK  and SYNC  digital inputs.  \nFigure 7 shows the analog output, RGB video waveform of the \nADV7125. The influence of SYNC  and BLANK  on the analog \nvideo waveform is illustrated.  Table 8 details the resultant effect on the analog outpu ts of \nBLANK  and SYNC . \nAll these digital inputs are specified to accept TTL logic levels.  \nCLOCK INPUT \nThe CLOCK input of the ADV7125 is typically the pixel cloc k \nrate of the system. It is also known as the dot rate. The dot rate, and thus the required CLOCK frequency, is determined by the \non-screen resolution, according to the following equation:  \nDot Rate  = (Horiz Res ) × (Vert Res ) × (Refresh \nRate )/(Retrace Fact or) \nwhere:  \nHoriz Res  is the number of pixels per line.  \nVert Res  is the number of lines per frame.  \nRefresh Rate  is the horizontal scan rate. This is the rate at which \nthe screen must be refreshed, typically 60 Hz for a  noninterlaced \nsystem, or 30 Hz for an interlaced system.  \nRetrace Factor  is the total blank time factor. This takes into \naccount that the display is blanked for a certain fraction of the \ntotal duration of each frame (for example, 0.8).  \nTherefore, for a graphics system with a 1024 × 1024 resolut ion, \na noninterlaced 60 Hz refresh rate, and a retrace factor of 0.8,  \nDot Rate  = 1024 × 1024 × 60/0.8 = 78.6 MHz  \nThe required CLOCK frequency is thus 78.6 MHz. All video \ndata and control inputs are latched into the ADV7125 on the \nrising edge of CLOCK, as previously described in the Digital \nInputs  section. It is recommended that the CLOCK input to the \nADV7125 be driven by a TTL buffer (for example, the 74F244).  \nRED AND BLUE\nNOTES\n1. OUTPUTS CONNECTED TO A DOUBLY TERMINATED 75Ω LOAD.\n2.

Many graphics processors and CRT controllers have the \nability to generate horizontal sync (HSYNC), vertical sync \n(VSYNC), and composite SYNC . \nIn a graph ics system that does not automatically generate a \ncomposite SYNC  signal, the inclusion of some additional logic \ncircuitry enables the generation of a composite SYNC  signal.  \nThe sync current is internally connected direct ly to the IOG \noutput, thus encoding video synchronization information onto \nthe green video channel. If it is not required to encode sync \ninformation onto the ADV7125 , the SYNC  input should be tied \nto logic low.  \nREFERENCE INPUT  \nThe ADV7125 contains an on -board voltage reference. The V REF \npin should be connected as shown in Figure 12.  \nA resistance, R SET, connected between the R SET pin and GND, \ndetermines the amplitude of the output video level according to \nEquation 1 and Equation 2 for the ADV7125.  \nIOG  (mA) = 11,444.8 × V REF (V)/RSET (Ω) (1) \nIOR, IOB (mA) = 7989.6 × V REF (V)/ RSET (Ω) (2) \nEquation 1 applies to the ADV7125 only, when SYNC  is being \nused. If SYNC  is not being enco ded onto the green channel, \nEquation 1 is similar to Equation 2.  \nUsing a variable value of R SET allows for accurate adjustment of \nthe analog output video levels. Use of a fixed 560 Ω R SET resistor \nyields the analog output levels quoted in the Specifications  section. \nThese values typically correspond to the RS -343A video wave-\nform values, as shown in Figure 7. \nDAC s \nThe ADV7125 contains three matched 8 -bit DACs. The DACs \nare designed using an advanced, high speed, segmented  architec -\nture. The bit currents corresponding to each digital input are \nrouted to either the analog output (bit = 1) or GND (bit = 0)  by a sophis ticated decoding scheme. Because all this circuitry  \nis on one monolithic device, matching between the three DACs is optimized. As well as matching, the use of identical current \nsources in a monolithic design guarantees monotonicity and \nlow glitch. The on -board operational amplifier stabilizes the full-scale output current against temperature and power supply \nvariations.  \nANALOG OUTPUTS  \nThe ADV7125 has three analog outputs, corresponding to the \nred, green, and blue video signals. \nThe red, green, and blue analog outputs of the ADV7125 are \nhigh impedance current sources. Each one of these three RGB \ncurrent outputs is capable of directly driv ing a 37.5 Ω load, such \nas a doubly terminated 75 Ω coaxial cable. Figure 8 shows the \nrequired configuration for each of the three RGB outputs connected into a doubly terminated 75 Ω load . This  arrangement \ndevelops  RS-343A video output voltage levels across a 75 Ω \nmonitor.  \nA suggested method of driving RS -170 video levels into a 75 Ω \nmonitor is shown in Figure 9. The output current levels of the \nDACs remain unchanged, but the source termination resistance, \nZ\nS, on each of the three DACs is increased from 75 Ω to 150 Ω.  \nIOR, IOG, IOB\nZS = 75Ω\n(SOURCE\nTERMIN ATION)\nTERMIN ATION REPE ATED THREE TIMES\nFOR RED, GREEN, AND BLUE DACsZL = 75Ω\n(MONI TOR)Z0 = 75Ω\n(CABLE)DACs\n03097-006 \nFigure 8.

As well as the gray scale levels (black level to white \nADV7125 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 14 of 17 level), Figure 7 also shows the contributions of SYNC  and \nBLANK  for the ADV7125 . These control inputs add appro-\npriately weighted currents to the analog outputs, producing  \nthe specific output level requirements for video applications. \nTable 8 details how the SYNC  and BLANK  inputs modify the \noutput levels. \nGRAY SCALE OPERATION \nThe ADV7125  can be used for standalone, gray scale (mono-\nchrome) or composite video applications (that is, only one channel \nused for video information). Any one of the three channels, red, green, or blue, can be used to input the digital video data. The two unused video data channels should be tied to Logic 0. The unused analog outputs should be terminated with the same load \nas that for the used channel, that is, if the red channel is used \nand IOR is terminated with a doubly terminated 75 Ω load (37.5 Ω), IOB and IOG should be terminated with 37.5 Ω \nresistors (see Figure 10). \nR0\nR7\nG0ADV7125\nG7\nB0\nB7IOR\nIOG\n37.5ΩDOUBLY\nTERMINATED75Ω LOADVIDEO\nOUTPUT\n37.5ΩIOB\nGND\n03097-008 \nFigure 10. Input and Output Connections for Standalone Gray Scale or \nComposite Video \nVIDEO OUTPUT BUFFERS \nThe ADV7125  is specified to drive transmission line loads. The \nanalog output configuration to drive such loads is described in the \nAnalog Outputs section and illustrated in Figure 11. However,  \nin some applications, it may be required to drive long transmis-\nsion line cable lengths. Cable lengths greater than 10 meters can attenuate and distort high frequency analog output pulses. The inclusion of output buffers compensates for some cable distortion. Buffers with large full power bandwidths and gains between  \ntwo and four are required. These buffers also need to be able  \nto supply sufficient current over the complete output voltage swing. Analog Devices produces a range of suitable op amps for such applications. These include the AD843, AD844, AD847, \nand AD848 series of monolithic op amps. In very high frequency \napplications (80 MHz), the AD8061 is recommended. More \ninformation on line driver buffering circuits is given in the \nrelevant op amp data sheets. \nUse of buffer amplifiers also allows implementation of other \nvideo standards besides RS-343A and RS-170. Altering the gain \ncomponents of the buffer circuit results in any desired video level. 372\nZL = 75Ω\n(MONITOR)Z0 = 75ΩZ2 Z1\n+VS\n–VS0.1µF\n0.1µF75Ω\n(CABLE)\nGAIN (G) = 1 +DACsIOR, IOG, IOB\nZS = 75Ω\n(SOURCE\nTERMINATION)AD8484\n6\n03097-009Z1\nZ2  \nFigure 11. AD848  as an Output Buffer \nPCB LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS \nThe ADV7125  is optimally designed for lowest noise perfor-\nmance, both radiated and conducted noise. To complement the \nexcellent noise performance of the ADV7125 , it is imperative \nthat great care be given to the PCB layout. Figure 12 shows a \nrecommended connection diagram for the ADV7125 . \nThe layout should be optimized for lowest noise on the \nADV7125  power and ground lines. This can be achieved by \nshielding the digital inputs and providing good decoupling.  Shorten the lead length between groups of V\nAA and GND pins \nto minimize inductive ringing. \nIt is recommended to use a 4-layer printed circuit board with a \nsingle ground plane. The ground and power planes should \nseparate the signal trace layer and the solder side layer. Noise  \non the analog power plane can be further reduced by using multiple decoupling capacitors (see Figure 12). Optimum performance is achieved by using 0.1 μF and 0.01 μF ceramic capacitors. Individually decouple each V\nAA pin to ground by \nplacing the capacitors as close as possible to the device with the capacitor leads as short as possible, thus minimizing lead inductance. It is important to note that while the ADV7125  \ncontains circuitry to reject power supply noise, this rejection decreases with frequency. If a high frequency switching power supply is used, pay close attention to reducing power supply \nnoise. A dc power supply filter (Murata BNX002) provides EMI \nsuppression between the switching power supply and the main PCB. Alternatively, consideration can be given to using a 3-\nterminal voltage regulator. \nDIGITAL SIGNAL INTERCONNECT \nIsolate the digital signal lines to the ADV7125  as much as \npossible from the analog outputs and other analog circuitry. Digital signal lines should not overlay the analog power plane. \nDue to the high clock rates used, long clock lines to the \nADV7125  should be avoided to minimize noise pickup. \nConnect any active pull-up termination resistors for the digital \ninputs to the regular PCB power plane (V\nCC) and not to the \nanalog power plane. \n \n \nData Sheet ADV7125  \n \nRev. D | Page 15 of 17 ANALOG SIGNAL INTERC ONNECT  \nPlace the ADV7125 as close as possible to the output  connectors, \nthus minimizing noise pickup and reflections due to impedance \nmisma tch. \nThe video output signals should overlay the ground plane and \nnot the analog power plane, thereby maximizing the high \nfrequency power supply rejection.  For optimum performance, the analog outputs should each \nhave a source termination resistance to grou nd of 75 Ω (doubly \nterminated 75 Ω configuration). This termination resistance should be as close as possible to the ADV7125 to minimize \nreflections.  \nAdditional information on PCB design is avail able in the  \nAN-333 Application Note , Design and Layout of a Video \nGraphics System for Reduced EMI . \n \n35\n36\n37\n33\n31\n27R7TO R041TO 48COM P VAA VAA VAA\nVAA\nVREF\nRSET\nIOR\n75Ω 75Ω 75ΩCOAXIA L CABLE\n75ΩPOWER SUPP LY DECOUPLING\n(0.1µF AND 0.01µF CA PACITOR\nFOR EACH VAAGROUP )\nAD1580\nADV7125MONI TOR (CRT)1\n2\nBNC\nCONNEC TORS\nCOMPLEMEN TARY\nOUTPUTS75Ω1kΩ\nRSET\n530Ω\nIOG\nIOB\n12SYNC\n11BLANK\n24CLOCK\n38PSAVE\nGND\n1, 2, 14, 15,\n25, 26, 39, 4013, 29,\n30\nVIDEO\nDATA\nINPUTSG7TO G03TO 10\nB7TO B016TO 23\nIOR\nIOG\nIOB75Ω\n75Ω32\n28340.1µF0.1µF\n1µF0.01µF\n03097-010 \nFigure 12.
