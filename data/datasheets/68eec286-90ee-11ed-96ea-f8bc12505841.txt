#### Description:
The TB0746A is a Surface Mount Device (SMD) SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave) filter designed for RF (Radio Frequency) applications. Its primary function is to filter specific frequency signals, allowing only the desired frequency (140 MHz) to pass while attenuating unwanted frequencies. This is crucial in communication systems to ensure signal integrity and reduce interference.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Wireless Communication:** Used in mobile phones, base stations, and other wireless devices to filter signals.
- **Signal Processing:** Employed in various RF applications where precise frequency selection is necessary.
- **Television and Radio Broadcasting:** Utilized in tuners to select specific channels.
- **Data Transmission Systems:** Helps in maintaining signal clarity in data communication systems.

The TB0746A is RoHS compliant and lead-free, making it suitable for modern electronic manufacturing processes that require environmentally friendly components.
