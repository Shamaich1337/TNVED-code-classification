The high Power Supply \nRejection Ratio (PSRR) in the 0.1 MHz to 10 MHz range provides excellent rejection of any preceding switching regulator or other power supply noise. The voltage output is ideal for frequency generation subsystems including Hittite’s broad line of PLLs with integrated VCOs. \nThe output voltage can be adjusted lower than the \ndefault value by using one external resistor. The output can be set to 5V by grounding the HV pin. The regulator can be powered down by the TTL-compatible Enable input. The HMC976LP3E is housed in a 3x3mm QFN SMT package.High Output Current: 400mA\nLow Dropout: 300mV at 400mA Output and VR>3VUltra Low Noise: 3nV/√Hz at 10 kHz, 6nV/√Hz at 1 kHzHigh Power Supply Rejection Ratio\n (P\nSRR):\n  <-\n60 dB at 1 kHz, <-30 dB at 1 MHz\nAdjustable Voltage Output: VR  1.8 to 5V at 400mADesigned to work with low ESR ceramic capacitorsLow Power-Down Current: <1 µAThermal Protection16 Lead 3x3 mm SMT Package: 9mm²Typical Applications\nThe HMC976LP3E is ideal for:• Test Instrumentation• Military Radios, Radar and ECM• Basestation Infrastructure• Ultra Low Noise Frequency Generation• Fractional-N Synthesizer Supply• Microwave VCO Supply• Mixed-Signal Circuit Supply• Low Noise Baseband Circuit Supply\nTable 1.

This is for the default  output \nvoltage of 4.8V nominal. The values shown are those recommended for optimum Noise Spectral density. For users \nrequiring extremely low noise in the 1 MHz to 10 MHz range the largest output capacitor should be used: a 68uF takes the noise between 100 kHz and 1 MHz to below 2.5nV/√Hz.\nLoad Capacitor Characteristics\nThe HMC976LP3E  was  designed to work with a low ESR ceramic load capacitor on the VRX  pin (C21 in the schematic above). Low ESR ceramic capacitors are very small and best for eliminating high frequency  noise. Ceramic capacitors can vary as much as 50% versus temperature and 60% versus voltage, dependant  on the ceramic type e.g. Z5U, Y5V,  X7R or  X5R. There are no restrictions on ceramic type or minimum ESR, only that the user must guarantee that the minimum output capacitance over operating conditions is 4.7μF, smaller values can result in noise peaking or lower stability.Figure 13.

The value of the resistor is given by the equation below.\nIf the temperature stability performance similar to that shown in the plot “Vout=5V and Vref vs. Temperature” is  \nrequired, then any external resistor temperature coefficient is a critical parameter and should be better than 50ppm \nand 1% tolerance. Please note that the temperature coefficient of the internal resistor feedback divider is 270ppm/°C.\nLayout of PCB \nThe layout of the PCB should follow these guide lines, the PADDLE should be connected to ground with at least 5 vias directly under the paddle to the bottom side ground plane. To ensure the noise and PSRR  specifications are met, the capacitors connecting to Pins 15, 11, 3 (see user application schematics), should be placed  as close as possible to the relevant pin and  the ground connection should be as short as possible. Trace widths and via sizes should be scaled to match the current drawn. The use of a large ground plane is recommended with a large number of ground vias near the device to carry the ground. \nThermal Protection\nThe HMC976LP3E includes an integrated thermal protection circuit. If the junction temperature of the HMC976LP3E reaches the maximum operating junction temperature (115°C max, 130°C typical) then the thermal protection circuit temporarily disables the HMC976LP3E outputs (with ~500uA output current) until the junction temperature cools down by approximately 10°C. \nA typical reason for the increase of the junction temperature is an unexpected increase in current draw. By disabling \nthe outputs, the HMC976LP3E is in this case protecting the other devices on the PCB that it is supplying with current. The thermal protection circuitry will also indirectly protect against a short circuit at the output. After the overload or the fault condition is removed or changed, the regulator output returns to the nominal operation\nFor reliable long term operation the “Recommended Operating Condition”  must be followed and the maximum junc -\ntion temperature must not be exceeded. The junction temperature for a given dissipation can be calculated from the \nequation below:\nWhere Tj=Junction Temperature (°C), Ta=Ambient Temperature (°C), Pd=Dissipated Power (W)   =Thermal  \nResistivity Junction to Ambient (°C/W).
