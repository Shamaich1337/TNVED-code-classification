Converter  \nThe EV1320QI is designed to replace low efficiency linear regulators as well as expensive switch -mode DCDC \nmemory terminations. The patented EV1320QI architecture provides efficiencies up to 96% with a solution \nfootprint similar to that of a lin ear regulator.   \nVOUT (VTT) tracks ½ VDDQ with ±40mV accuracy and is compliant with DDR2/3/ 4/QDR and low power \nDDR 3/4 JEDEC memory termination requirements.  The EV1320QI tracks VDDQ directly so there is no need \nfor a separate reference voltage or resistor divider network.   \nIf a VREF signal is needed for the VTT termination, it can be generated by an external VREF divider circuit from \nVDDQ, as shown in Figure 5.

Choose  high accuracy resistors for R VREF. If more current is needed for VREF, the divider signal may be \nbuffered by a voltage follower as shown in Figure 5. Be sure the R VREF resistor values are negligible compared \nto the input impedance of the voltage follower to ensure VREF voltage accuracy.  \n \nFigure 5. VREF Divider External Circuit  \nSoft -Start Operation  \nThe E V1320QI has a programmable soft -start.  The EV1320 can operate with AVIN on, ENABLE high, and VDDQ \nramped up and down. If, however, VDDQ comes up first, and then the device is enabled, the soft -start capacitor \nlimits the rise of the output (VTT).  The output (VTT)  ramp rate is determined by the value of the soft start (SS) \ncapacitor , as shown in Table 1.  The soft -start time begins when ENABLE crosses its threshold until VTT reaches \nfinal value.    \nTable 1.

When enable is pulled high the \ndevice will go through a soft start sequence.  When enable is pulled low such as if the memory device enters \nS3 (suspend to RAM) , the output will be discharged through a 100 Ω resistor.  Please note that if the \nequivalent load resistance is lower than 100 Ω, the output will discharge faster. The ENABLE pin should not \nbe left floating.  \nPower OK (POK)  \nThe EV1320QI provides an open drain output to indicate if the output voltage stays within nominally +/ - 10% \nof VDDQ/2.  Within this range, the POK output is allowed to be pulled high. Outside this range, POK remains \nlow. However, during transitions such as enable/disable and fault restart the POK output will not change state \nuntil the tra nsition is complete for enhanced noise immunity.  \nThe POK has 1mA sink capability for events where it needs to feed a device with standard CMOS inputs. When \nPOK is pulled high, the pin leakage current is as low as 2 5µA maximum over temperature. This allows  a large \npull up resistor such as 100k Ω to be used for minimal current consumption in shutdown mode.  \nOver -Current Protection  \nThe overload function is achieved by sensing the output voltage. An overload state is entered when the device is out of soft start and the output voltage drops below ~85% of VDDQ/2. When an OCP condition is detected, the device is disabled, the output is discharged through a 100 resistor for a period of 1.5mS.  After the 1.5mS \ndischarge time has expired, a soft start is initiated as described in the soft start section.  If an over current \ncondition is again detected the device will repeat the discharge/soft start cycle in a hiccup manner as long as the over current condition persists.  \nThermal Overload Protection  \nThermal shutdown will disable operation when the Junction temperature exceeds approximately 150ºC. Output will discharge through a 100 ohm resistor for 1.5mS.  If the thermal fault  condition  is still present   then \nthe device will hiccup until temp falls by 25 °C. Once the junction temperature drops by approximately 25ºC, \nthe converter will re -start with a normal soft- start.  \nInput Under- Voltage Lock- out  \nInternal circuits ensure that the converter will not start switching until the AVIN voltage is above the specified minimum voltage.  \n \n \n   \n \n06831                                                                                                                    September 4, 2018                                                                                                                Rev E\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EV1320QI  \nPage 16   APPLICATION INFORMATION  \nGeneral Application Circuit  \nFigure 6 shows a typical application circuit for the EV1320QI.  The resistor before the AVIN capacitor  is optional , \nbut recommended if AVIN supply is noisy.   \n   \nFigure 6: General Application Circuit  for 2A Operation  \nNOTE:  The output filter capacitor section assumes that there is additional decoupling on the VTT island(s) of \napproximately 100µF per amp of VTT current.  If this VTT decoupling is not present, additional bulk \ncapacitance will be required on the EV1320QI output.  \nSoft -Start ramp rate is set by choice of the soft start capacitor (C SS) as described in the soft start section.  \nPower Up Sequence  \nDuring power up, neither ENABLE nor VDDQ should be asserted before AVIN. There are two common \nacceptable turn -on/off sequences for the device. ENABLE can be tied to AVIN and come up with it,  and VDDQ \ncan be ramped up and down as needed. In this case, the output will attempt to track VDDQ. Alternatively, VDDQ can be brought high after AVIN is assert ed, and the device can be turned on and off by toggling the \nENABLE pin. In this case, the output will ramp up as determined by the soft -start capacitor, and it will turn off \nas described in “Enable Operation” section.  \n \n VTT\nC1PVOUT\nAVIN\nAGNDSSVDDQ\nENABLEPGND\nPGNDC1N\n15nFVDDQ\n3.3VVREF\nDIVIDERVREF\nEV1320 QI\n10µF22µF\n22µF +\n1 x 10µF22µF\n1ΩOPTIONAL\n06831                                                                                                                    September 4, 2018                                                                                                                Rev E\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EV1320QI  \nPage 17   Input Capacitors  \nA 22µF 4V X5R MLCC capacitor  is required at the VDDQ input  for 2A applications .

Up to 4 devices can be paralleled \nto achieve a VTT current of up to 8A.  Figure 7 shows an example circuit diagram for parallel operation of three \nEV1320QIs. The following guidelines must be followed for proper parallel operation.   \n1. The VDDQ inputs should be connected to a common VDDQ bus.   \n2. The VOUT connections should be connected to a common VTT bus.   \n3. Each EV1320QI device must have its own input and output capacitors connected close to the device as \ndescribed in the input and output capacitor sections. The input and output capacitors should be \nconnected to the local PGND pins on the respective EV1320QI devices.   \n4. The C1N -C1P capacitors should only be connected to their respective EV1320QI devices.  They should \nnot be connected to any common bus, VIN, VOUT, or any other signal or plane.  \n5. All AVIN connections should be tied to a common 3.3V supply rail.  Each EV1320QI should have its own \nAVIN filter resistor and capacitor if required.  \n6. All ENABLE pins should be tied to a common enable signal.  \n7. All soft start pins should be tied together and a single soft start capacitor should be used.  Each device \nshould NOT have its own soft start capacitor.  \n8. All Analog ground (AGND) connections should be tied together.  The single soft start capac itor should \nbe connected to this common AGND.  \n9.

Whenever \nthere are power losses in a system, the heat that is generated by the power dissipation needs to be accounted \nfor.  \nThe Altera Enpirion EV1320 QI VDDQ/VTT Converter  is packaged in a  3x3x0.55 mm 16-pin QFN package. The \nrecommended maximum junction temperature for continuous operation is 125°C.  Continuous operation \nabove 125°C may  reduce long -term reliability. The device has a thermal overload protec tion circuit designed \nto turn off the device at  an approximate junction temperature value of 150°C.   \nThe EV1320 QI is guaranteed to support the full 2A output current up to 85°C ambient temperature. The \nfollowing example and calculations illustrate the therma l performance of the EV1320QI.  \nExample:  \nVDDQ  = 1.2V \nVTT = 0.6 V \nIOUT = 2A \nFirst calculate the output power.  \nPOUT = VTT * I OUT = 0.6V x 2A = 1.2 W \nNext, determine the input power based on the efficiency  (η) shown in Figure 8 .  \n \nFigure  8: Efficiency vs. Output Current  \nFor VDDQ  = 1.2V, VTT  = 0.6V at 2A, η ≈ 92.6%  \nη = P OUT / P IN = 92.6% = 0.926  \nPIN = P OUT / η \nPIN ≈ 1.2W / 0.9 26 ≈ 1.2959 W \nThe power dissipation (P D) is the power loss in the system and can be calculated by subtracting the outpu t \npower from the input power.  \nPD = P IN – P OUT  \n     ≈ 1.2959W – 1.2W ≈  0.0959 W 808284868890929496\n00.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 11.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2EFFICIENCY (%)\nOUTPUT CURRENT (A)Efficiency vs. Output Current\nVTT = 0.6VCONDITIONS\nAVIN= 3.0V\nVDDQ = 2* VTT92.6%\n06831                                                                                                                    September 4, 2018                                                                                                                Rev E\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EV1320QI  \nPage 21   With the power dissipation  known , the temperature rise in the device  may be estimated based on the theta JA \nvalue (θ JA). The θ JA parameter estimates how much the temperature will rise in the device for every watt of \npower dissipation. The E V1320QI  has a θ JA value of 50  ºC/W  without airflow.  \nDetermine the change in temperature (ΔT) based on P D and θ JA. \nΔT = P D x θ JA \nΔT ≈ 0.0959W x 50°C/W = 4.795°C ≈ 4.8°C  \nThe junction temperature (T J) of the device is approximately the ambient temperature (T A) plus the change in \ntemperature. We assume the initial ambient temperature to be 25°C.  \nTJ = T A + ΔT  \nTJ ≈ 25°C + 4.8°C ≈ 29.8°C  \nWith 0.0959W dissipated into the device, the T J will be 29.8°C.  \nThe maximum operating junction temperature (T JMAX) of the device is 125°C, so the device can operate at a \nhigher ambient temperature. The maximum ambient temperature (T AMAX) allowed can be calculated.  \nTAMA X = T JMAX – P D x θ JA \n          ≈ 125°C – 4.8°C ≈ 120.2°C  \nThe ambient temperature can actually rise by another 95.2°C, bringing it to 120.2°C before the device will \nreach T JMAX. This indicates that the EV1320QI can support the full 2A output current range u p to approximately \n120.2°C ambient temperature given the input and output voltage conditions. This allows the EV1320QI to guarantee full 2A output current capability at 85°C with room for margin. Note that the efficiency will be slightly \nlower at higher te mperatures and these calculations are estimates.  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n06831                                                                                                                    September 4, 2018                                                                                                                Rev E\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EV1320QI  \nPage 22   LAYOUT RECOMMENDATION S \nFigure 9 shows the critical components along with top and bottom traces of a recommended minimum \nfootprint EV1320QI layout with ENABLE tied to VDDQ . Alternate enabling configurations, and the POK pin \nwould have to be connected and routed according to the specific customer application. Please see the Gerber \nfiles at www.altera.com/enpirion  for exact dimensions and the internal layers.  \n \n \nFigure 9:  Typical Top Side and Bottom Side Layout Recommendation (Top View)  \n \nRecommendation 1:  Input and output filter capacitors should be placed on the same side of the PCB, and as \nclose to the EV1320 QI package as possible. They should be connected to the device with very short and wide \ntraces. Do not use thermal reliefs or spokes when connecting the capacitor pads to the respective nodes. The +V and GND traces between the capacitors and the EV1320 QI should be as close to each other as possible so \nthat the gap between the two nodes is minimized, even under the capacitors.  \nRecommendation 2: The C1N -C1P capacitors should be placed as close to the C1N -C1P pins as possible. Use \nlarge copper planes to minimize resistance and inductance. The C1P  and C1N  traces between the capacitors \nand the EV1320 QI should be as close to each other as possible so that the gap between the two nodes is \nminimized, even under the capacitors.  \nRecommendation 3: The system ground pla ne should be the first layer immediately below the surface layer  \n(layer 2) . This ground plane should be continuous and un- interrupted below the converter and the \ninput/output capacitors.  \n06831                                                                                                                    September 4, 2018                                                                                                                Rev E\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EV1320QI  \nPage 23   Recommendation 4: The VDDQ and VOUT copper are paralleled on layers 3  and 4 in order to minimize overall \nseries resistance. Please see Gerber files.  \nRecommendation 5: AVIN is the power supply for the internal control circuits. It should be connected to the \n3.3V bus at a quiet point. A 10µF bypass capacitor (shown on the backside in Figure 9) is needed on the AVIN \nnode. If the AVIN supply is noisy, an optional 1Ω resistor is recommended in series with AVIN. See Figure 6.  \nRecommendation 6: The AGND pin does not get connected to PGND on layer 1. It connects to PGND on layer \n2 ground plane. This provides some noise isolation between AGND and the noisy PGND trace on layer 1.  \nRecommendation 7: The soft -start capacitor CSS and the AVIN capacitor CAVIN are placed on the back side \nin Figure 9 so that the input PGND trace is not com promised.  \nRecommendation 8: If POK needs to be used, place a via to the left of pin 4, and route the POK trace on layer \n3 to the POK resistor. Place the POK resistor to AVIN such that any modifications to the traces and placements \nin this recommended layou t are minimized.  \nRecommendation 9: Follow all the layout recommendations as close as possible to optimize performance. \nAltera provides schematic and layout reviews for all customer designs.
