Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n12.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n12.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from \na standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit boardFig 8. Example of typical box and reel information barcode label\nTable 15.

Packages with solder balls, and some leadless \npackages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, \nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivit y level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n12.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhe sive and flux, clinching of leads, board \ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are \nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\n12.4 Reflow soldering\nKey characteristics in reflow soldering are:\n•Lead-free versus SnPb solderi ng; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to \nhigher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 9 ) than a SnPb process, thus \nreducing the process window\n•Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process window for a mix of large and small components on one board\n•Reflow temperature profile; this profile includ es preheat, reflow (in which the board is \nheated to the peak temperature) and coolin g down. It is imperative that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 16\n and 17\n Table 16.
