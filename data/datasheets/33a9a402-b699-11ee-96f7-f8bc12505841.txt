Safety precautions\n 2. Precautions for use\n\nFixed Resistors\nThe performance of these products, including the solderability, is guaranteed for a year from the date of\narrival at your company, provided that they remain packed as they were when delivered and stored at \na temperature of  5 °C to 35 °C and a relative humidity of 45 % to 85 %.\nEven within the above guarantee periods, do not store these products in the following conditions. \nOtherwise, their electrical performance and/or solderability may be deteriorated, and the packagingmaterials (e.g. taping materials) may be deformed or deteriorated, resulting in mounting failures.\n1. In salty air or in air with a high concentration of corrosive gas, such as Cl2, H2S, NH3, SO2, or NOX .\n2. In direct sunlight.\n＜Package markings ＞\nPackage markings include the product number, quantity, and country of origin.In principle, the country of origin should be indicated in English.\nThe products are tested based on all or part of the test conditions and methods defined in AEC-Q200.\nPlease consult with Panasonic for the details of the product specification and specific evaluation test results, \netc., make sure to exchange product specifications for each product when placing an order.\n10-Feb-23 3. Precautions for storage\n 4. AEC-Q200 compliant\n\nSurface Mount Resistors\nThe following are precautions for individual products. Please also refer to the common precautions for Fixed \n Resistors in this catalog.\n1. Take measures against mechanical stress during and after mounting of Surface Mount Resistors \n (hereafter called the resistors) so as not to damage their electrodes and protective coatings.\nBe careful not to misplace the resistors on the land patterns. Otherwise, solder bridging may occur.\n2. Keep the rated power and ambient temperature within the specified derating curve.\nSome circuit boards, wiring patterns, temperatures of heat generated by adjacent components, or ambient temper a tures can become factors in the rise of the temperature of the resistors, regardless of\nthe level of power applied. Therefore, check the conditions before use and op timize them so as not to  \ndamage the boards and peripheral components. \nMake sure to contact us before using the resistors under special conditions.\n3. If a transient load (heavy load in a short time) like a pulse is expected to be applied, check and evaluate \nthe operations of the resistors when installed in your products before use. Never exceed the rated power.\nOtherwise, the performance and/or reliability of the resistors may be impaired.\n4. Transient voltage \nIf there is a possibility that the transient phenomenon (significantly high voltage applied in a short time) \nmay occur or that a high voltage pulse may be applied, make sure to evaluate and check the\ncharacteristics of resistors mounted on your product rather than only depending on the calculated power \nlimit or steady-state conditions.\n5. The electrical characteristics may change when used in high-frequency circuits, so check thoroughly before use.\nSuch circuits change the electrical characteristics of the resistors.\n6.Before using halogen-based or other high-activity flux, check the possible effects of the flux residues on the\nperformance and reliability of the resistors.\n7. When soldering with a soldering iron, never touch the resistors\'bodies with the tip of the soldering iron. \nWhen using a soldering iron with a high temperature tip, finish soldering as quickly as possible\n (within three seconds at 350 °C max.).\n8. The connection reliability and performance may be affected if the amount of solder is too much or too little. \nCheck the performance and reliability of the product and use an appropriate amount of solder.\n9. When the resistors\' protective coatings are chipped, flawed, or removed, the characteristics of the \nresistors may be impaired. Take special care not to apply mechanical shock during automatic mountingor cause damage during handling of the boards with the resistors mounted.\n 10. Do not apply shock to the resistors or pinch them with a hard tool (e.g. pliers and tweezers). Otherwise, \nthe resistors\' protective coatings and bodies may be chipped, affecting their performance.\n 11. Avoid excessive bending of printed circuit boards in order to protect the resistors from abnormal stress.\n12. Do not immerse the resistors in solvent for a long time. \nBefore using solvent, carefully check the effects of immersion.\n 13.
