They are available in a1.8W SO package. Typical dropouts are 320mV at 5Vand 500mA, or 240mV at 3.3V and 200mA. Quiescentcurrents are 15µA typ and 35µA max. Shutdown turnsoff all circuitry and puts the regulator in a 2µA off mode.A unique protection scheme limits reverse currentswhen the input voltage falls below the output. Other fea-tures include foldback current limiting and thermaloverload protection.\nThe output is preset at 3.3V for the MAX604 and 5V for\nthe MAX603. In addition, both devices employ DualMode™ operation, allowing user-adjustable outputsfrom 1.25V to 11V using external resistors. The inputvoltage supply range is 2.7V to 11.5V.\nThe MAX603/MAX604 feature a 500mA P-channel\nMOSFET pass transistor. This transistor allows thedevices to draw less than 35µA over temperature, inde-pendent of the output current. The supply currentremains low because the P-channel MOSFET pass tran-sistor draws no base currents (unlike the PNP transis-tors of conventional bipolar linear regulators). Also,when the input-to-output voltage differential becomessmall, the internal P-channel MOSFET does not sufferfrom excessive base current losses that occur with sat-urated PNP transistors.\n________________________Applications\n5V and 3.3V Regulators\n1.25V to 11V Adjustable RegulatorsBattery-Powered DevicesPagers and Cellular PhonesPortable InstrumentsSolar-Powered Instruments____________________________Features\n\'500mA Output Current, with Foldback Current\nLimiting\n\'High-Power (1.8W) 8-Pin SO Package\n\'Dual Mode™ Operation: Fixed or AdjustableOutput from 1.25V to 11V\n\'Large Input Range (2.7V to 11.5V) \n\'Internal 500mA P-Channel Pass Transistor\n\'15µA Typical Quiescent Current\n\'2µA (Max) Shutdown Mode\n\'Thermal Overload Protection\n\'Reverse-Current Protection\n______________Ordering Information\n* Dice are tested at T A= +25°C, DC parameters only.\n** Contact factory for availability.5V/3.3V or Adjustable, Low-Dropout, \nLow I Q, 500mA Linear Regulators\n1\n23\n48\n7\n65OUT\rGND\rGND\rSETIN\r\nGND\rGND\r\nOFF\nMAX603\r\nMAX604\nDIP/SOTOP VIEW__________________Pin Configuration\nMAX603\r\nMAX604OUT\nSET GNDIN\nOFFCOUT\r\n10µFCIN\r\n10µFBATTERYOUTPUT\r\nVOLTAGE__________Typical Operating Circuit\n19-0269; Rev 0; 9/94PART\nMAX603 CPA\nMAX603CSA\nMAX603C/D 0°C to +70°C0°C to +70°C0°C to +70°CTEMP.

Test Circuit\nMAX603/MAX604\nMaxim Integrated\n5\n_______________Detailed Description\nThe MAX603/MAX604 are low-dropout, low-quiescent-\ncurrent linear regulators designed primarily for battery-powered applications. They supply an adjustable 1.25Vto 11V output or a preselected 5V (MAX603) or 3.3V(MAX604) output for load currents up to 500mA. Asillustrated in Figure 2, they consist of a 1.20V reference,error amplifier, MOSFET driver, P-channel pass transis-tor, dual-mode comparator, and internal feedback volt-age divider.\nThe 1.20V bandgap reference is connected to the error\namplifier’s inverting input. The error amplifier comparesthis reference with the selected feedback voltage andamplifies the difference. The MOSFET driver reads theerror signal and applies the appropriate drive to the P-channel pass transistor. If the feedback voltage is lowerthan the reference, the pass transistor gate is pulledlower, allowing more current to pass and increasing theoutput voltage. If the feedback voltage is too high, thepass transistor gate is pulled up, allowing less currentto pass to the output. The output voltage is fed back through either an internalresistor voltage divider connected to the OUT pin, or anexternal resistor network connected to the SET pin. Thedual-mode comparator examines the SET voltage andselects the feedback path used. If SET is below 80mV,internal feedback is used and the output voltage is regulat-ed to 5V for the MAX603 or 3.3V for the MAX604.Additional blocks include a foldback current limiter, reversecurrent protection, thermal sensor, and shutdown logic.\nInternal P-Channel Pass Transistor\nThe MAX603/MAX604 feature a 500mA P-channelMOSFET pass transistor.  This provides several advan-tages over similar designs using PNP pass transistors,including longer battery life. \nThe P-channel MOSFET requires no base drive, which\nreduces quiescent current considerably. PNP basedregulators waste considerable amounts of current indropout when the pass transistor saturates. They alsouse high base-drive currents under large loads. TheMAX603/MAX604 do not suffer from these problemsand consume only 15µA of quiescent current underlight and heavy loads, as well as in dropout.5V/3.3V or Adjustable, Low-Dropout, \nLow I Q, 500mA Linear Regulators\nPMOSFET DRIVER\r\nWITH FOLDBACK\r\nCURRENT LIMIT\nTHERMAL\r\nSENSORSHUTDOWN\r\nLOGIC\n1.20V\r\nREFERENCE DUAL-MODE\r\nCOMPARATORR1\nR2OUT\nSETREVERSE\r\nCURRENT\rPROTECTION\n80mVERROR AMPIN\nOFF\nGNDMAX603\r\nMAX604SHUTDOWN\nFigure 2. Functional Diagram\nMAX603/MAX604\n6\nMaxim Integrated\nOutput Voltage Selection\nThe MAX603/MAX604 feature dual-mode operation. In\npreset voltage mode, the output of the MAX603 is set to5V and the output of the MAX604 is set to 3.3V usinginternal, trimmed feedback resistors. Select this modeby connecting SET to ground.\nIn adjustable mode, an output between 1.25V and 11V\nis selected using two external resistors connected as avoltage divider to SET (Figure 3). The output voltage isset by the following equation:\nwhere V\nSET= 1.20V. To simplify resistor selection: \nSince the input bias current at SET is nominally zero,\nlarge resistance values can be used for R1 and R2 tominimize power consumption without losing accuracy. Upto 1.5MΩis acceptable for R2. Since the V\nSETtolerance\nis less than ±40mV, the output can be set using fixedresistors instead of trim pots.\nIn preset voltage mode, impedances between SET and\nground should be less than 10k Ω. Otherwise, spurious\nconditions could cause the voltage at SET to exceedthe 80mV dual-mode threshold.\nShutdown\nA low input on the OFF pin shuts down the MAX603/\nMAX604. In the off mode, the pass transistor, controlcircuit, reference, and all biases are turned off, reduc-ing the supply current below 2µA. OFF\nshould be con-\nnected to IN for normal operation.\nUse a fast comparator, Schmitt trigger, or CMOS or TTL\nlogic to drive the OFF pin in and out of shutdown. Rise\ntimes should be shorter than 1µs. Do not use slow RCcircuits, leave OFF\nopen, or allow the input to linger\nbetween thresholds; these measures will prevent theoutput from jumping to the positive supply rail inresponse to an indeterminate input state.\nSince the OFF\nthreshold varies with input supply volt-\nage (see Electrical Characteristics ), do not derive the\ndrive voltage from 3.3V logic. With VINat 11.5V, the\nhigh OFF logic level needs to be above 4V.\nFoldback Current Limiting \nThe MAX603/MAX604 also include a foldback current\nlimiter. It monitors and controls the pass transistor’sgate voltage, estimating the output current and limitingit to 1.2A for output voltages above 0.8V and V\nIN- VOUT> 0.7V. For VIN- VOUT< 0.7V (dropout operation), there\nis no current limit. If the output voltage drops below0.8V, implying a short-circuit condition, the output cur-rent is limited to 350mA. The output can be shorted toground for one minute without damaging the device ifthe package can dissipate V\nIN x 350mA without\nexceeding TJ= +150°C. \nThermal Overload Protection\nThermal overload protection limits total power dissipa-tion in the MAX603/MAX604. When the junction temper-ature exceeds T\nJ= +160°C, the thermal sensor sends a\nsignal to the shutdown logic, turning off the pass tran-sistor and allowing the IC to cool. The thermal sensorwill turn the pass transistor on again after the IC’s junc-tion temperature cools by 10°C, resulting in a pulsedoutput during thermal overload conditions.\nThermal overload protection is designed to protect the\nMAX603/MAX604 in the event of fault conditions. Forcontinual operation, the absolute maximum junction tem-perature rating of T\nJ= +150°C should not be exceeded.\nOperating Region and Power Dissipation\nMaximum power dissipation of the MAX603/MAX604depends on the thermal resistance of the case and cir-cuit board, the temperature difference between the diejunction and ambient air, and the rate of air flow. Thepower dissipation across the device is P = I\nOUT (VIN-\nVOUT). The resulting maximum power dissipation is:\nwhere (TJ- TA) is the temperature difference between\nthe MAX603/MAX604 die junction and the surroundingP  T -  T\n +  MAXJA\nJB BA=()\n()\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f7 θθR1  R2 V\nV - 1OUT\nSET=\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7V  V 1  R1\nR2OUT SET=+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 5V/3.3V or Adjustable, Low-Dropout, \nLow I Q, 500mA Linear Regulators\nMAX603\r\nMAX604OUT\nSET\nGNDIN\nOFFCOUT\r\n10µFCIN\r\n0.1µF to\r\n10µFBATTERYOUTPUT\rVOLTAGE\nR1\nR2RL\nFigure 3.

The 8-pin SOIC package for theMAX603/MAX604 features a special lead frame with alower thermal resistance and higher allowable powerdissipation. The thermal resistance of this package isq\nJB= 42°C/W, compared with qJB= 110°C/W for an 8-\npin plastic DIP package and qJB= 125°C/W for an 8-pin\nceramic DIP package.\nThe GND pins of the MAX603/MAX604 SOIC package\nperform the dual function of providing an electrical con-nection to ground and channeling heat away. Connectall GND pins to ground using a large pad or groundplane. Where this is impossible, place a copper planeon an adjacent layer. The pad should exceed thedimensions in Figure 4.\nFigure 4 assumes the IC is an 8-pin SOIC package, is\nsoldered directly to the pad, has a +125°C maximumjunction temperature and a +25°C ambient air tempera-ture, and has no other heat sources. Use larger padsizes for other packages, lower junction temperatures,higher ambient temperatures, or conditions where the ICis not soldered directly to the heat-sinking ground pad.\nThe MAX603/MAX604 can regulate currents up to\n500mA and operate with input voltages up to 11.5V, butnot simultaneously. High output currents can only besustained when input-output differential voltages arelow, as shown in Figure 5. Maximum power dissipationdepends on packaging, board layout, temperature, andair flow.

The control circuitry can\nthen remain functioning and turn the pass transistor off,limiting reverse currents back through the device. Thisfeature allows a backup regulator or battery pack tomaintain V\nOUTwhen the supply at IN fails.\nReverse-current protection activates when the voltageon IN falls 6mV (20mV maximum) below the voltage onOUT. Before this happens, currents as high as severalmilliamperes can flow back through the device. Afterswitchover, typical reverse currents are limited to0.01µA for as long as the condition exists. __________Applications Information\nFigure 6 illustrates the typical application for theMAX603/MAX604. \nCapacitor Selection and \nRegulator Stability\nNormally, use 0.1µF to 10µF capacitors on the inputand 10µF on the output of the MAX603/MAX604. Thelarger input capacitor values provide better supply-noise rejection and line-transient response. Improveload-transient response, stability, and power-supplyrejection by using large output capacitors. For stableoperation over the full temperature range and with loadcurrents up to 500mA, 10µF is recommended. Usingcapacitors smaller than 3.3µF can result in oscillation. \nNoise \nThe MAX603/MAX604 exhibit 3mVp-p to 4mVp-p ofnoise during normal operation. This is negligible in mostapplications. When using the MAX603/MAX604 in appli-cations that include analog-to-digital converters ofgreater than 12 bits, consider the ADC’s power-supplyrejection specifications. Refer to the output noise plot inthe \nTypical Operating Characteristics .\nPSRR and Operation from Sources \nOther than Batteries\nThe MAX603/MAX604 are designed to deliver lowdropout voltages and low quiescent currents in battery-powered systems. Achieving these objectives requirestrading off power-supply noise rejection and swiftresponse to supply variations and load transients.Power-supply rejection is 80dB at low freqencies androlls off above 10Hz. As the frequency increases above10kHz, the output capacitor is the major contributor tothe rejection of power-supply noise (Figure 7). Do notuse power supplies with ripple above 100kHz, especial-ly when the ripple exceeds 100mVp-p. When operatingfrom sources other than batteries, improved supply-noise rejection and transient response can be achievedby increasing the values of the input and output capaci-tors, and through passive filtering techniques. The\nTypical Operating Characteristics show the MAX603/\nMAX604 supply and load-transient responses.\nTransient Considerations\nThe Typical Operating Characteristics show the\nMAX603/MAX604 load-transient response. Two compo-nents of the output response can be observed on theload-transient graphs—a DC shift from the output imped-ance due to the different load currents, and the transientresponse. Typical transients for step changes in the loadcurrent from 5mA to 500mA are 0.2V. Increasing the out-put capacitor’s value attenuates transient spikes.5V/3.3V or Adjustable, Low-Dropout, \nLow I Q, 500mA Linear Regulators\nMAX603\r\nMAX604OUT\nSET GNDIN\nOFFCOUT\r\n10µFCIN BATTERYOUTPUT\r\nVOLTAGE\n5060\n0\n100101102103104105106POWER-SUPPLY REJECTION RATIO\r\nvs. FREQUENCY\n10\nMAX603/4-FIG-06\nFREQUENCY (Hz)PSRR (dB)\n2030408090\n70IOUT = 1mA\n VIN = 1V p-p\r\n FOR f < 400kHz\r\n CIN = 0µF\r\n COUT = 10µFIOUT = 100mAFigure 6. 3.3V or 5V Linear-Regulator Application\nFigure 7.

In battery-powered systems, this will determinethe useful end-of-life battery voltage. Because theMAX603/MAX604 use a P-channel MOSFET pass tran-sistor, their dropout voltage is a function of r\nDS(ON) multi-\nplied by the load current (see Electrical Characteristics ).\nQuickly stepping up the input voltage from the dropoutvoltage can result in overshoot. This occurs when thepass transistor is fully on at dropout and the IC is notgiven time to respond to the supply voltage change.Prevent this by slowing the input voltage rise time.5V/3.3V or Adjustable, Low-Dropout, \nLow I Q, 500mA Linear Regulators\n___________________Chip Topography\nIN\n0.100"\r\n(2.54mm)\n0.104"\r\n(2.64mm)OFF GND SETOUT\nTRANSISTOR COUNT: 111\nNO DIRECT SUBSTRATE CONNECTION.
