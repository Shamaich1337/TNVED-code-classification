Application  \nThe LEDs described here are intended to be used for  ordinary electronic equipment (such as office \nequipment, communication equipment and household ap plications).Consult Liteon’s Sales in advance \nfor information on applications in which exceptiona l reliability is required, particularly when the fa ilure \nor malfunction of the LEDs may directly jeopardize life or health (such as in aviation, transportation , \ntraffic control equipment, medical and life support  systems and safety devices).  \n2. Storage \nThe package is sealed:  \n  The LEDs should be stored at 30°C or less and 90% RH or less. And the LEDs are limited to use within \none year, while the LEDs is packed in moisture-proo f package with the desiccants inside. \nThe package is opened:  \nThe storage ambient for the LEDs should not exceed 30°C temperature or 60% relative humidity. \nIt is recommended that LEDs out of their original p ackaging are IR-reflowed within one week. \nFor extended storage out of their original packagin g, it is recommended that the LEDs be stored in a \nsealed container with appropriate desiccant, or in a desiccators with nitrogen ambient.  \nLEDs stored out of their original packaging for mor e than a week should be baked at about 60 deg C \nfor at least 20 hours before solder assembly.  \n3.
