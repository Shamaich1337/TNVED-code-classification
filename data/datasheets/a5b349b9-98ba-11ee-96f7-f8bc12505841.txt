Ball Details \nSymbol  Type  Description  \nCK, CK# Input  Differential Clock:  CK and CK# are driven by the system clock. All SDRAM input signals \nare sampled on the crossing of positive edge of CK  and negative edge of CK #. Output \n(Read) data is referenced to the cross ings of CK and CK # (both directions of crossing).\nCKE Input  Clock Enable:  CKE activates ( HIGH) and deactivates ( LOW ) the CK signal. If CKE goes \nLOW  synchronously with clock, the internal clock is suspended from the next clock cycle \nand the state of output  and burst address is froze n as long as the CKE remains LOW . \nWhen all banks are in the idle state, deactivating the clock controls the entry to the Power \nDown and Self Refresh modes.  \nBA0-BA2 Input  Bank Address : BA0-BA2 define to which bank the BankActivat e, Read, Write, or Bank  \nPrecharge command is being applied.  \nA0-A15 Input  Address Inputs: A0-A15 is sampled during  row address (A0 -A15) for Active commands \nand the column address (A0 -A9) for Read/Write commands to select one location out of \nthe memory arra y in the respective bank. (A10/AP and A12/BC# have additional functions).  \nThe address inputs also provide the op -code during Mode Register Set commands.  \nA10/AP  Input  Auto -Precharge:  A10 is sampled during Read/Write commands to determine whether  \nAutoprecha rge should be performed to the accessed bank after the Read/Write  operation. \n(HIGH: Autoprecharge; LOW: no Autoprecharge). A10 is sampled during a  Precharge \ncommand to determine whether the Precharge applies to one bank (A10  LOW) or all \nbanks (A10 HIGH).  \nA12/BC# Input  Burst Chop:  A12/BC# is sampled during Read and Write commands to determine if  burst \nchop (on the fly) will be performed. (HIGH - no burst chop; LOW - burst chopped).  \nCS# Input  Chip Select:  CS# enables (sampled LOW) and disables (sampled HIG H) the command \ndecoder . All commands are masked when CS# is sampled HIGH. It is considered part of \nthe command code.  \nRAS# Input  Row Address Strobe:  The RAS# signal defines the operation co mmands in conjunction \nwith the CAS# and WE# signals and is latched at the crossing of positive edges of CK  and \nnegative edge of CK# . When RAS # and CS# are asserted "LOW" and CAS# is asserted \n"HIGH " either the BankActivate command or the Precha rge command is selected by the \nWE# signal. When the WE# is asserted "HIGH " the B ankActivate command is selected \nand the  bank designated by B A is turned on  to the active state. When the WE# is asserted \n"LOW " the Precharge command is selected and the bank designated by B A is switched to \nthe idle state after the precharge operation.  \nCAS# Input Column Address Strobe:  The CAS# signal defines the operation commands in  \nconjunction with the RAS # and WE# signals and is latched at the crossing of positive \nedges of CK  and negative edge of CK# . When RAS# is held "HIGH" and CS# is asserted \n"LOW " the column access is started by asserting CAS# "LOW ". Then, the Read or Write \ncommand is selected by asserting WE# “HIGH " or “LOW ".\nWE# Input  Write Enable: The WE# signal defines the operation commands in  conjunction with the \nRAS# and CAS# signals and is l atched at the crossing of positive edges of CK  and \nnegative edge of CK# . The WE# input is used to select the BankActivate or Precharge \ncommand and Read or Write command.  \nDQS,  \nDQS #Input / \nOutput  Bidirectional  Data Strobe: Specifies timing for Input and O utput data. Read Data Strobe \nis edge triggered. Write Data Strobe provides a setup and hold time for data and DM. The \ndata strobes DOS is paired with DQS# to provide differential pair signaling to the system \nduring both reads and writes.\nTDQS  \nTDQS # Output  Termination Data Strobe:  When TDQS is  enabled, DM is disabled, and the TDQS and \nTDQS# balls provide termination  resistance . \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 6 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nDM Input  Data Input Mask:  Input data is masked when DM is sampled HIGH during a write cycle. \nDM has an optional use as TDQS on th e x8. \nDQ0-DQ7 Input / \nOutput  Data I/O: The DQ0 -DQ7 input and output data are synchronized with positive and negative \nedges of DQS and DQS #. TheI/Os are byte -maskable during Writes.  \nODT  Input  On Die Termination:  ODT (registered HIGH) enables termination resistance internal  to \nthe DDR3L  SDRAM. When enabled, ODT is applied to each DQ, DQS,  DQS#, DM/TDQS \nand TDQS# signal. (When TDQS is enabled via Mode Register A11=1 in MR1)  The ODT \npin will be ignored if Mode -registers, MR1and MR2, are  programmed to disable  RTT.  \nRESET # Input  Active Low Asynchronous Reset:  Reset is active when RESET # is LOW, and inactive  \nwhen RESET#  is HIGH. RESET # must be HIGH during normal operation. RESET# is a \nCMOS rail to rail signal with DC high and low at 80% and 20% of VDD . \nVDD Supp ly Power Supply:  +1.35V -0.067V/+0.1V. \nVSS Supply  Ground\nVDDQ Supply  DQ Power: +1.35V -0.067V/+0.1V . \nVSSQ Supply  DQ Ground  \nVREFCA Supply  Reference voltage for CA  \nVREFDQ Supply  Reference voltage for DQ \nZQ Supply  Reference pin for ZQ calibration.  \nNC - No Connect:  These pins should be left unconnected.  \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 7 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nOperation Mode Truth Table \nThe following tables provide a quick reference of available DDR3L SDRAM commands, including CKE power-\ndown modes and bank- to-bank commands. \nTable 4.

The DDR3L SDRAM uses an 8n prefetch architecture to achieve high speed operation. The 8n Prefetch \narchitecture is combined with an interface designed to transfer two data words per clock cycle at the I/O pins. A \nsingle read or write operation for the DDR3L SDRAM consists of a single 8n-bit wide, four clock data transfer at the \ninternal DRAM core and two corresponding n-bit wide, one-half clock cycle data transfers at the I/O pins. \nRead and write operation to the DDR3L SDRAM are burst oriented, start at a selected location, and continue for a \nburst length of eight or a ‘chopped’ burst of four in a programmed sequence. Operation begins with the registration \nof an Active command, which is then followed by a Read or Write command. The address bits registered coincident \nwith the Active command are used to select the bank and row to be activated (BA0-BA2 select the bank; A0- A15 \nselect the row). The address bit registered coincident with the Read or Write command are used to select the \nstarting column location for the burst operation, determine if the auto precharge command is to be issued (via A10), \nand select BC4 or BL8 mode ‘on the fly’ (via A12) if enabled in the mode register. \nPrior to normal operation, the DDR3L SDRAM must be powered up and initialized in a predefined manner. The \nfollowing sections provide detailed information covering device reset and initialization, register definition, command \ndescriptions and device operation. \nFigure 4.

CKE is pulled “Low” anytime before\nRESET# being de-asserted (min. time 10ns). The power voltage ramp time between 300mV to VDDmin must be\nno greater than 200ms; and during the ramp, VDD>VDDQ and (VDD-VDDQ) <0.3 Volts.\n- VDD and VDDQ are driven from a single power converter output, AND\n- The voltage levels on all pins other than VDD, VDDQ, VSS, VSSQ must be less than or equal to VDDQ and\nVDD on one side and must be larger than or equal to VSSQ and VSS on the other side. In addition, VTT is\nlimited to 0.95V max once power ramp is finished, AND\n- Vref tracks VDDQ/2.\nOR\n- Apply VDD without any slope reversal before or at the same time as VDDQ.\n- Apply VDDQ wit hout any slope reversal before or at the same time as VTT & Vref.\n- The voltage levels on all pins other than VDD, VDDQ, VSS, VSSQ must be less than or equal to VDDQ and\nVDD on one side and must be larger than or equal to VSSQ and VSS on the other side.\n2.After RESET# is de-asserted, wait for another 500us until CKE become active. During this time, the DRAM will\nstart internal state initialization; this will be done independently of external clocks.\n3.Clock (CK, CK#) need to be started and stabilized for at least 10ns or 5tCK (which is larger) before CKE goes\nactive. Since CKE is a synchronous signal, the corresponding set up time to clock (tIS) must be meeting. Also a\nNOP or Deselect command must be registered (with tIS set up time to clock) before CKE goes active. Once the\nCKE registered “High” after Reset, CKE needs to be continuously registered “High” until the initialization sequence\nis finished, including expiration of tDLLK and tZQinit.\n4.The DDR3L DRAM will keep its on-die termination in high impedance state as long as RESET# is asserted.\nFurther, the DRAM keeps its on-die termination in high impedance state after RESET# deassertion until CKE is\nregistered HIGH. The ODT input signal may be in undefined state until tIS before CKE is registered HIGH. When\nCKE is registered HIGH, the ODT input signal may be statically held at either LOW or HIGH. If RTT_NOM is to be\nenabled in MR1, the ODT input signal must be statically held LOW. In all cases, the ODT input signal remains\nstatic until the power up initialization sequence is finished, including the expiration of tDLLK and tZQinit.\n5.After CKE being registered high, wait minimum of Reset CKE Exit time, tXPR, before issuing the first MRS\ncommand to load mode register.(tXPR=max (tXS, 5tCK))\n6.Issue MRS command to load MR2 with all application settings. (To issue MRS command for MR2, provide “Low”\nto BA0 and BA2, “High” to BA1)\n7.Issue MRS Command to load MR3 with all application settings. (To issue MRS command for MR3, provide “Low”\nto BA2, “High” to BA0 and BA1)\n8.Issue MRS Command to load MR1 with all application settings and DLL enabled. (To issue “DLL Enable”\ncommand, provide “Low” to A0, “High” to BA0 and “Low” to BA1 and BA2)\n9.Issue MRS Command to load MR0 with all application settings and “DLL reset”. (To issue DLL reset command\nprovide “High” to A8 and “Low” to BA0-BA2)\n10.Issue ZQCL command to starting ZQ calibration.\n11.Wait for both tDLLK and tZQinit completed.\n12.The DDR3L SDRAM is now ready for normal operation.\nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 10 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nReset Procedure at Stable Power \nThe following sequence is required for RESET at no power interruption initialization. \n1.Asserted RESET below 0.2*VDD anytime when reset is needed (all other inputs may be undefined). RESET\nneeds to be maintained for minimum 100ns. CKE is pulled “Low” before RESET being de-asserted (min. time\n10ns).\n2.Follow Power-up Initialization Sequence step 2 to 11.\n3.The Reset sequence is now completed.

As the default values of the Mode Registers are not defined, contents of Mode Registers must be \nfully initialized and/or re-initialized, i.e. , written, after power up and/or reset for proper operation. Also the contents of \nthe Mode Registers can  be altered by re-executing the MRS command during normal operation. When programming \nthe mode registers, even if the user chooses to modify only a sub-set of the MRS fields, all address fields within the \naccessed mode register must be redefined when the MRS command is issued. MRS command and DLL Reset do \nnot affect array contents, which mean these commands can be executed any time after power-up without affecting \nthe array contents.  \nThe mode register set command cycle time, tMRD is required to complete the write operation to the mode \nregister and is the minimum time required between two MRS commands shown in Figure of tMRD timing. \nFigure 6. tMRD timing \nT1 T2 Ta0 Ta1 Tb0 Tb1 Tb2 Tc0 Tc1 T0 Tc2\nVALIDtMRD\nODTLoff + 1\nDon\'t Care\n TIME BREAKVALID VALID VALID MRS NOP/DES NOP/DES MRS NOP/DES NOP/DES VALID VALID\nVALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID\nOld Settings Updating Settings\nVALID VALID\nVALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALIDtMOD\nNew Settings\nRTT_Nom ENABLED prior and/or after MRS command\nRTT_Nom DISABLED prior and after MRS commandCK#\nADDRESSCK\nCOMMAND\nCKE\nSettings\nODT\nODT\nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 12 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nThe MRS command to Non-MRS command delay, tMOD, is require for the DRAM to update the features except \nDLL reset, and is the minimum time required from an MRS command to a non-MRS command excluding NOP and \nDES shown in Figure of tMOD timing. \nFigure 7. tMOD timing \nCK#T1 T2 Ta0 Ta1 Ta2 Ta3 Ta4 Tb0 Tb1 T0\nADDRESSCKTb2\nVALIDCOMMAND\nCKE\nSettings\nODT\nODTODTLoff + 1\nDon\'t Care\n TIME BREAKVALID VALID VALID MRS NOP/DES NOP/DES NOP/DES NOP/DES NOP/DES VALID VALID\nVALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID\nOld Settings Updating Settings\nVALID VALID\nVALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALID VALIDtMOD\nNew Settings\nRTT_Nom ENABLED prior and/or after MRS command\nRTT_Nom DISABLED prior and after MRS command\nThe mode register contents can be changed using the same command and timing requirements during normal \noperation as long as the DRAM is in idle state, i.e. , all banks are in the precharged state with tRP satisfied, all data \nbursts are completed and CKE is high prior to writing into the mode register.

The mode register is \nwritten by asserting low on CS#, RAS#, CAS#, WE#, BA0, BA1, and BA2, while controlling the states of address pins \naccording to the following figure. \nTable 5.

WR (write recovery for autoprecharge) min in clock cycles is calculated by dividing tWR (ns) by tCK (ns) and rounding up to the \nnext integer WRmin [cycles] =Roundup (tWR / tCK). The value in the mode register must be programmed to be equal or larger \nthan WRmin. The programmed WR value is used with tRP to determine tDAL. \n- CAS Latency\nThe CAS Latency is defined by MR0 (bit A2, A4 ~A6) as shown in the MR0 Definition figure. CAS Latency is the delay, \nin clock cycles, between the internal Read command and the availability of the first bit of output data. DDR3L \nSDRAM does not support any half clock latencies. The overall Read Latency (RL) is defined as Additive Latency (AL) \n+ CAS Latency (CL); RL = AL + CL.\n- Test Mode\nThe normal operating mode is selected by MR0 (bit7=0) and all other bits set to the desired values shown in the \nMR0 definition figure. Programming bit A7 to a ‘1’ places the DDR3L SDRAM into a test mode that is only used by \nthe DRAM manufacturer and should not be used. No operations or functionality is guaranteed if A7=1. \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 14 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\n- Burst Length, Type, and Order\nAccesses within a given burst may be programmed to sequential or interleaved order. The burst type is selected via \nbit A3 as shown in the MR0 Definition as above figure. The ordering of access within a burst is determined by the \nburst length, burst type, and the starting column address. The burst length is defined by bits A0-A1. Burst lengths \noptions include fix BC4, fixed BL8, and on the fly which allow BC4 or BL8 to be selected coincident with the \nregistration of a Read or Write command via A12/BC# \nTable 6.

In case of burst length being fixed to 4 by MR0 setting, the internal write operation starts two clock cycles earlier than for the \nBL8 mode. This means that the starting point for tWR and tWTR will be pulled in by two clocks. In case of burst length being \nselected on-the-fly via A12/BC#, the internal write operation starts at the same point in time like a burst of 8 write operation. This \nmeans that during on-the-fly control, the starting point for tWR and tWTR will not be pulled in by two clocks.  \nNote 2. 0~7 bit number is value of CA[2:0] that causes this bit to be the first read during a burst.  \nNote 3. T: Output driver for data and strobes are in high impedance . \nNote 4. V: a valid logic level (0 or 1), but respective buffer input ignores level on input pins. \nNote 5. X: Don’t Care.  \n- DLL Reset\nThe DLL Reset bit is self-clearing, meaning it returns back to the value of ‘0’ after the DLL reset function has been \nissued. Once the DLL is enabled, a subsequent DLL Reset should be applied. Anytime the DLL reset function is \nused, tDLLK must be met before any functions that require the DLL can be used (i.e. Read commands or ODT \nsynchronous operations.) \n- Write Recovery\nThe programmed WR value MR0 (bits A9, A10, and A11) is used for the auto precharge feature along with tRP to \ndetermine tDAL . WR (write recovery for auto-precharge) min in clock cycles is calculated by dividing tWR (ns) by \ntCK (ns) and rounding up to the next integer: WR m in [cycles] = Roundup (tWR [ns]/tCK [ns]). The WR must be \nprogrammed to be equal or larger than tWR (min). \n- Precharge PD DLL\nMR0 (bit A12) is used to select the DLL usage during precharge power-down mode. When MR0 (A12=0), or ‘slow-\nexit’, the DLL is frozen after entering precharge power-down (for potential power savings) and upon exit requires \ntXPDLL to be met prior to the next valid command. When MR0 (A12=1), or ‘fast-exit’, the DLL is maintained after \nentering precharge power-down and upon exiting power-down requires tXP to be met prior to the next valid \ncommand. \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 15 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nMode Register MR1 \nThe Mode Register MR1 stores the data for enabling or disabling the DLL, output strength, Rtt_Nom impedance, \nadditive latency, WRITE leveling enable and Qoff.

If RTT_Nom is used during Writes, only the values RZQ/2, RZQ/4 and RZQ/6 are allowed.  \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 16 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\n- DLL Enable/Disable\nThe DLL must be enabled for normal operation. DLL enable is required during power up initialization, and upon \nreturning to normal operation after having the DLL disabled. During normal operation (DLL-on) with MR1 (A0=0), the \nDLL is automatically disabled when entering Self-Refresh operation and is automatically re-enable upon exit of Self-\nRefresh operation. Any time the DLL is enabled and subsequently rese t, tDLLK clock cycles must occur before a \nRead or synchronous O\nDT command can be issued to allow time for the internal clock to be synchronized with the \nexternal clock. Failing to wait for synchronization to occur may result in a violation of the tDQSCK, tAON, or tAOF \nparameters. During tDLLK, CKE must continuously be registered high. DDR3L SDRAM does not require DLL for any \nWrite operation, expect when RTT_WR is enabled and the DLL is required for proper ODT operation. For more \ndetailed information on DLL Disable operation are described in DLL-off Mode. The direct ODT feature is not \nsupported during DLL-off mode. The on-die termination resistors must be disabled by continuously registering the \nODT pin low and/or by programming the RTT_Nom bits MR1{A9,A6,A2} to {0,0,0} via a mode register set command \nduring DLL-off mode. \nThe dynamic ODT feature is not supported at DLL-off mode. User must use MRS command to set Rtt_WR, MR2 \n{A10, A9} = {0, 0}, to disable Dynamic ODT externally \n- Output Drive\nr Impedance Control\nThe output driver impedance of the DDR3L SDRAM device is selected by MR1 (bit A1 and A5) as shown in MR1 \ndefinition figure. \n- ODT Rtt Values\nDDR3L \nSDRAM is capable of providing two different termination values (Rtt_Nom and Rtt_WR). The nominal \ntermination value Rtt_Nom is programmable in MR1. A separate value (Rtt_WR) may be programmable in MR2 to \nenable a unique Rtt value when ODT is enabled during writes. The Rtt_WR value can be applied during writes even \nwhen Rtt_Nom is disabled. \n- Additive Latenc\ny (AL)\nAdditive Latency (AL) operation is supported to make command and data bus efficient for sustainable bandwidth in \nDDR3L SDRAM. In this operation, the DDR3L SDRAM allows a read or write command (either with or without auto-\nprecharge) to be issued immediately after the active command. The command is held for the time of the Additive \nLatency (AL) before it is issued inside the device. The Read Latency (RL) is controlled by the sum of the AL and \nCAS Latency (CL) register settings. Write Latency (WL) is controlled by the sum of the AL and CAS Write Latency \n(CWL) register settings. A summary of the AL register options are shown in MR. \n- Write lev\neling\nFor better signal integrity, DDR3L memory module adopted fly-by topology for the commands, addresses, control \nsignals, and clocks. The fly-by topology has benefits from reducing number of stubs and their length but in other \naspect, causes flight time skew between clock and strobe at every DRAM on DIMM. It makes difficult for the \nController to maintain tDQSS, tDSS, and tDSH specification. Therefore, the controller should support ‘write leveling’ \nin DDR3L SDRAM to compensate for skew. \n- Output Disable\nT\nhe DDR3L SDRAM outputs maybe enable/disabled by MR1 (bit 12) as shown in MR1 definition. When this feature \nis enabled (A12=1) all output pins (DQs, DQS, DQS#, etc.) are disconnected from the device removing any loading \nof the output drivers. This feature may be useful when measuring modules power for example. For normal operation \nA12 should be set to ‘0’. \n- TDQS enable\nTDQS (\nTermination Data Strobe) is a feature of DDR3L SDRAM that provides additional termination resistance \noutputs that may be useful in some system configurations. In contrast to the RDQS function of DDR2 SDRAM, \nTDQS provides the termination resistance function only. The data strobe function of RDQS is not provided by TDQS. \nThe TDQS and DM functions share the same pin. When the TDQS function is enabled via the mode register, the \nDM function is not supported. When the TDQS function is disabled, the DM function is provided and the TDQS# pin \nis not used. The TDQS function is available in X8 DDR3L SDRAM only. \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 17 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nMode Register MR2 \nThe Mode Register MR2 stores the data for controlling refresh related features, Rtt_WR impedance, and CAS write \nlatency.

Data integrity will be maintained if tREFI conditions are met and no Self-\nRefresh command is issued. \n- CAS Write Latency (CWL)\nThe CAS Write Latency is defined by MR2 (bits A3-A5) shown in MR2. CAS Write Latency is the delay, in clock \ncycles, between the internal Write command and the availability of the first bit of input data. DDR3L DRAM does not \nsupport any half clock latencies. The overall Write Latency (WL) is defined as Additive Latency (AL) + CAS Write \nLatency (CWL); WL=AL+CWL. \nFor more information on the supported CWL and AL settings based on the operating clock frequency, refer to \n“Standard Speed Bins”. For detailed Write operation refer to “WRITE Operation”. \n- Dynamic ODT (Rtt_WR)\nDDR3L SDRAM introduces a new feature “Dynamic ODT”. In certain application cases and to further enhance signal \nintegrity on the data bus, it is desirable that the termination strength of the DDR3L SDRAM can be changed without \nissuing an MRS command. MR2 Register locations A9 and A10 configure the Dynamic ODT settings.  \nDDR3L SDRAM introduces a new feature “Dynamic ODT”.

MR2 Register locations A9 and A10 configure the Dynamic ODT settings. In Write \nleveling mode, only RTT_Nom is available. For details on Dynamic ODT operation, refer to “Dynamic ODT”. \n- Self-Refresh Temperature (SRT)\nMode register MR2[7] is used to disable/enable the SRT function. When SRT is disabled, the self refresh mode’s \nrefresh rate is assumed to be at the normal 85°C limit (sometimes referred to as 1x refresh rate). In the disabled \nmode, SRT requires the user to ensure the DRAM never exceeds a TC of 85°C while in self refresh mode. \nWhen SRT is enabled, the DRAM self refresh is changed internally from 1x to 2x, regardless of the case \ntemperature. This enables the user to operate the DRAM beyond the standard 85°C limit up to the optional extended \ntemperature range of 95°C while in self refresh mode. The standard self refresh current test specifies test conditions \nto normal case temperature (85°C) only, meaning if SRT is enabled, the standard self refresh current specifications \ndo not apply (see Extended Temperature Usage).  \nExtended Temperature Usage \nDDR3L SDRAM supports the optional extended case temperature (TC) range of - 40°C to 95°C. The extended \ntemperature range DRAM must be refreshed externally at 2x (double refresh) anytime the case temperature is \nabove 85°C (and does not exceed 95°C). The external refresh requirement is accomplished by reducing the refresh \nperiod from 64ms to 32ms. Thus, SRT must be enabled when TC is above 85°C or self refresh cannot be used until \nTC is at or below 85°C.   \nTable 9.

When the MPR is enabled, only RD or RDA commands are allowed until a subsequent MRS command is \nissued with the MPR disabled (MR3 bit A2 = 0).

The MR1 A0 bit for DLL control can be switched either during initialization or later. \nThe DLL-off Mode operations listed below are an optional feature for DDR3L. The maximum clock frequency for \nDLL-off Mode is specified by the parameter tCKDLL_OFF. There is no minimum frequency limit besides the need to\nsatisfy the refresh interval, tREFI.\nDue to latency counter and timing restrictions, only one value of CAS Latency (CL) in MR0 and CAS Write Latency\n(CWL) in MR2 are supported. The DLL-off mode is only required to support setting of both CL=6 and CWL=6.\nDLL-off mode will affect the Read data Clock to Data Strobe relationship (tDQSCK) but not the data Strobe to Data\nrelationship (tDQSQ, tQH). Special attention is needed to line up Read data to controller time domain. Comparing\nwith DLL-on mode, where tDQSCK starts from the rising clock edge (AL+CL) cycles after the Read command, the\nDLL-off mode tDQSCK starts (AL+CL-1) cycles after the read command. Another difference is that tDQSCK may not\nbe small compared to tCK (it might even be larger than tCK) and the difference between tDQSCKmin and\ntDQSCKmax is significantly larger than in DLL-on mode.\nThe timing relations on DLL-off mode READ operation have shown at the following Timing Diagram (CL=6, BL=8)\nFigure 9.

This means once the clock frequency has been set and is to be in the “stable state”, the clock \nperiod is not allowed to deviate except for what is allowed for by the clock jitter and SSC (spread spectrum clocking) \nspecification. \nThe input clock frequency can be changed from one stable clock rate to another stable clock rate under two \nconditions: (1) Self-Refresh mode and (2) Precharge Power-Down mode. Outside of these two modes, it is illegal to \nchange the clock frequency. \nFor the first condition, once the DDR3L SDRAM has been successfully placed in to Self-Refresh mode and tCKSRE \nhas been satisfied, the state of the clock becomes a don’t care. Once a don’t care, changing the clock frequency is \npermissible, provided the new clock frequency is stable prior to tCKSRX. When entering and exiting Self-Refresh \nmode of the sole purpose of changing the clock frequency , the Self-Refresh entry and exit specifications must still be \nmet. The DDR3L SDRAM input clock frequency is allowed to change only within the minimum and maximum \noperating frequency specified for the particular speed grade. \nThe second condition is when the DDR3L SDRAM is in Precharge Power-Down mode (either fast exit mode or slow \nexit mode). If the RTT_Nom feature was enabled in the mode register prior to entering Precharge power down mode, \nthe ODT signal must continuously be registered LOW ensuring RTT is in an off state. If the RTT_Nom feature was \ndisabled in the mode register prior to entering Precharge power down mode, RTT will remain in the off state. The \nODT signal can be registered either LOW or HIGH in this case. A minimum of tCKSRE must occur after CKE goes \nLOW before the clock frequency may change. The DDR3L SDRAM input clock frequency is allowed to change only \nwithin the minimum and maximum operating frequency specified for the particular speed grade. During the input \nclock frequency change, ODT and CKE must be held at stable LOW levels. Once the input clock frequency is \nchanged, stable new clocks must be provided to the DRAM tCKSRX before precharge Power Down may be exited; \nafter Precharge Power Down is exited and tXP has expired, the DLL must be RESET via MRS. Depending on the \nnew clock frequency additional MRS commands may need to be issued to appropriately set the WR, CL, and CWL \nwith CKE continuously registered high. During DLL re-lock period, ODT must remain LOW and CKE must remain \nHIGH. After the DLL lock time, the DRAM is ready to operate with new clock frequency. \nFigure 12.

The fly by topology has benefits from reducing number of stubs and their length but in other aspect, \ncauses flight time skew between clock and strobe at every DRAM on DIMM. It makes it difficult for the Controller to \nmaintain tDQSS, tDSS, and tDSH specification. Therefore, the controller should support “write leveling” in DDR3L \nSDRAM to compensate the skew. \nThe memory controller can use the “write leveling” feature and feedback from the DDR3L SDRAM to adjust the \nDQS – DQS# to CK – CK# relationship. The memory controller involved in the leveling must have adjustable delay \nsetting on DQS – DQS# to align the rising edge of DQS – DQS# with that of the clock at the DRAM pin. DRAM \nasynchronously feeds back CK – CK#, sampled with the rising edge of DQS – DQS#, through the DQ bus. The \ncontroller repeatedly delays DQS – DQS# until a transition from 0 to 1 is detected. The DQS – DQS# delay \nestablished though this exercise would ensure tDQSS specification. \nBesides tDQSS, tDSS, and tDSH specification also needs to be fulfilled. One way to achieve this is to combine the \nactual tDQSS in the application with an appropriate duty cycle and jitter on the DQS- DQS# signals. Depending on \nthe actual tDQSS in the application, the actual values for tDQSL and tDQSH may have to be better than the absolute \nlimits provided in “AC Timing Parameters” section in order to satisfy tDSS and tDSH specification.  \nDQS/DQS# driven by the controller during leveling mode must be determined by the DRAM based on ranks \npopulated. Similarly, the DQ bus driven by the DRAM must also be terminated at the controller.  \nOne or more data bits should carry the leveling feedback to the controller across the DRAM configurations x8. \nTherefore, a separate feedback mechanism should be available for each byte lane. \nFigure 13.

With entering write leveling \nmode, the DQ pins are in undefined driving mode. During write leveling mode, only NOP or Deselect commands are \nallowed. As well as an MRS command to exit write leveling mode. Since the controller levels one rank at a time, the \noutput of other rank must be disabled by setting MR1 bit A12 to 1. Controller may assert ODT after tMOD, time at \nwhich DRAM is ready to accept the ODT signal. \nController may drive DQS low and DQS# high after a delay of tWLDQSEN, at which time DRAM has applied on-die \ntermination on these signals. After tDQSL and tWLMRD controller provides a single DQS, DQS# edge which is used \nby the DRAM to sample CK – CK# driven from controller. tWLMRD(max) timing is controller dependent.  \nDRAM samples CK – CK# status with rising edge of DQS and provides feedback on all the DQ bits asynchronously \nafter tWLO timing. There is a DQ output uncertainty of tWLOE defined to allow mismatch on DQ bits; there are no \nread strobes (DQS/DQS#) needed for these DQs. Controller samples incoming DQ and decides to increment or \ndecrement DQS – DQS# delay setting and launches the next DQS/DQS# pulse after some time, which is controller \ndependent. Once a 0 to 1  transition is detected, the controller locks DQS – DQS# delay setting and write leveling is \nachieved for the device.  \nFigure 14.

However, it is desirable for certain minor violations that the DRAM is guaranteed not to \n“hang up” and errors be limited to that particular operation. \nFor the following, it will be assumed that there are no timing violations with regard to the Write command itself \n(including ODT, etc.) and that it does satisfy all timing requirements not mentioned below. \nData Setup and Hold Violations \nShould the strobe timing requirements (tDS, tDH) be violated, for any of the strobe edges associated with a write \nburst, then wrong data might be written to the memory location addressed with the offending WRITE command. \nSubsequent reads from that location might result in unpredictable read data, however, the DRAM will work properly \notherwise. \nStrobe to Strobe and Strobe to Clock Violations \nShould the strobe timing requirements (tDQSH, tDQSL, tWPRE, tWPST) or the strobe to clock timing requirements \n(tDSS, tDSH, tDQSS) be violated, for any of the strobe edges associated with a Write burst, then wrong data might \nbe written to the memory location addressed with the offending WRITE command. Subsequent reads from that \nlocation might result in unpredictable read data, however the DRAM will work properly otherwise. \nWrite Timing Parameters \nThis drawing is for example only to enumerate the strobe edges that “belong” to a write burst. No actual timing \nviolations are shown here. For a valid burst all timing parameters for each edge of a burst need to be satisfied (not \nonly for one edge).  \nRefresh Command \nThe Refresh command (REF) is used during normal operation of the DDR3L SDRAMs. This command is not \npersistent, so it must be issued each time a refresh is required. The DDR3L SDRAM requires Refresh cycles at an \naverage periodic interval of tREFI. When CS#, RAS#, and CAS# are held Low and WE# High at the rising edge of \nthe clock, the chip enters a Refresh cycle. All banks of the SDRAM must be precharged and idle for a minimum of \nthe precharge time tRP(min) before the Refresh Command can be applied. The refresh addressing is generated by \nthe internal refresh controller. This makes the address bits “Don’t Care” during a Refresh command. An internal \naddress counter suppliers the address during the refresh cycle. No control of the external address bus is required \nonce this cycle has started. When the refresh cycle has completed, all banks of the SDRAM will be in the \nprecharged (idle) state. A delay between the Refresh Command and the next valid command, except NOP or DES, \nmust be greater than or equal to the minimum Refresh cycle time tRFC(min). \nIn general, a Refresh command needs to be issued to the DDR3L SDRAM regularly every tREFI interval. To allow \nfor improved efficiency in scheduling and switching between tasks, some flexibility in the absolute refresh interval is \nprovided. A maximum of 8 Refresh commands can be postponed during operation of the DDR3L SDRAM, meaning \nthat at no point in time more than a total of 8 Refresh commands are allowed to be postponed. In case that 8 \nRefresh commands are postponed in a row, the resulting maximum interval between the surrounding Refresh \ncommands is limited to 9 x tREFI. A maximum of 8 additional Refresh commands can be issued in advance (“pulled \nin”), with each one reducing the number of regular Refresh commands required later by one. Note that pulling in \nmore than 8 Refresh commands in advance does not further reduce the number of regular Refresh commands \nrequired later, so that the resulting maximum interval between two surrounding Refresh command is limited to 9 x \ntREFI. Before entering Self-Refresh Mode, all postponed Refresh commands must be executed. \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 44 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nSelf-Refresh Operation \nThe Self-Refresh command can be used to retain data in the DDR3L SDRAM, even if the reset of the system is \npowered down. When in the Self-Refresh mode, the DDR3L SDRAM retains data without external clocking. The \nDDR3L SDRAM device has a built-in timer to accommodate Self-Refresh operation. The Self-Refresh Entry (SRE) \nCommand is defined by having CS#, RAS#, CAS#, and CKE held low with WE# high at the rising edge of the clock. \nBefore issuing the Self-Refreshing-Entry command, the DDR3L SDRAM must be idle with all bank precharge state \nwith tRP satisfied. Also, on-die termination must be turned off before issuing Self-Refresh-Entry command, by either \nregistering ODT pin low “ODTL + 0.5tCK” prior to the Self-Refresh Entry command or using MRS to MR1 command. \nOnce the Self-Refresh Entry command is registered, CKE must be held low to keep the device in Self-Refresh mode. \nDuring normal operation (DLL on), MR1 (A0=0), the DLL is automatically disabled upon entering Self- Refresh and is \nautomatically enabled (including a DLL-RESET) upon exiting Self-Refresh.  \nWhen the DDR3L SDRAM has entered Self-Refresh mode, all of the external control signals, except CKE and \nRESET#, are “don’t care”. For proper Self-Refresh operation, all power supply and reference pins (VDD, VDDQ, \nVSS, VSSQ, VRefCA, and VRefDQ) must be at valid levels. The DRAM initiates a minimum of one Refresh \ncommand internally within tCKE period once it enters Self-Refresh mode. \nThe clock is internally disabled during Self-Refresh operation to save power. The minimum time that the DDR3L \nSDRAM must remain in Self-Refresh mode is tCKE. The user may change the external clock frequency or halt the \nexternal clock tCKSRE after Self-Refresh entry is registered; however, the clock must be restarted and stable \ntCKSRX before the device can exit Self-Refresh mo de. \nThe procedure for exiting Self-Refresh requires a sequence of events. First, the clock must be stable prior to CKE \ngoing back HIGH. Once a Self-Refresh Exit Command (SRX, combination of CKE going high and either NOP or \nDeselect on command bus) is registered, a delay of at least tXS must be satisfied before a valid command not \nrequiring a locked DLL can be issued to the device to allow for any internal refresh in progress. Before a command \nwhich requires a locked DLL can be applied, a delay of at least tXSDLL and applicable ZQCAL function \nrequirements [TBD] must be satisfied. Before a command that requires a locked DLL can be applied, a delay of at \nleast tXSDLL must be satisfied. \nDepending on the system environment and the amount of time spent in Self-Refresh, ZQ calibration commands may \nbe required to compensate for the voltage and temperature drift as described in “ZQ Calibration Commands”. To \nissue ZQ calibration commands, applicable timing requirements must be satisfied.  \nCKE must remain HIGH for the entire Self-Refresh exit period tXSDLL for proper operation except for Self-Refresh \nre-entry. Upon exit from Self-Refresh, the DDR3L SDRAM can be put back into Self-Refresh mode after waiting at \nleast tXS period and issuing one refresh command (refresh period of tRFC). NOP or deselect commands must be \nregistered on each positive clock edge during the Self-Refresh exit interval tXS. ODT must be turned off during \ntXSDLL. The use of Self-Refresh mode instructs the possibility that an internally times refresh event can be missed \nwhen CKE is raised for exit from Self-Refresh mode. Upon exit from Self-Refresh, the DDR3L SDRAM requires a \nminimum of one extra refresh command before it is put back into Self-Refresh mode.  \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 45 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nPower-Down Modes \nPower-Down Entry and Exit \nPower-Down is synchronously entered when CKE is registered low (along with NOP or Deselect command). CKE is \nnot allowed to go low while mode register set command, MPR operations, ZQCAL operations, DLL locking or \nread/write operation are in progress. CKE is allowed to go low while any of other operation such as row activation, \nprecharge or auto precharge and refresh are in progress, but power-down IDD spec will not be applied until finishing \nthose operation. \nThe DLL should be in a locked state when power-down is entered for fastest power-down exit timing. If the DLL is \nnot locked during power-down entry, the DLL must be reset after exiting power-down mode for proper read operation \nand synchronous ODT operation. DRAM design provides all AC and DC timing and voltage specification as well \nproper DLL operation with any CKE intensive operations as long as DRAM controller complies with DRAM \nspecifications. \nDuring Power-Down, if all banks are closed after any in progress commands are completed, the device will be in \nprecharge Power-Down mode; if any bank is open after in progress commands are completed, the device will be in \nactive Power-Down mode. \nEntering Power-down deactivates the input and output buffers, excluding CK, CK, ODT, CKE, and RESET#. To \nprotect DRAM internal delay on CKE line to block the input signals, multiple NOP or Deselect commands are needed \nduring the CKE switch off and cycle(s) after, this timing period are defined as tCPDED. CKE_low will result in \ndeactivation of command and address receivers after tCPDED has expired. \nTable 24.

Pow er-down duration is limited by 9 times tREFI of the \ndevice. The power-down state is synchronously exited when CKE is registered high (along with a NOP or Deselect \ncommand).CKE high must be maintained until tCKE has been satisfied.

ODT is \nnot supported during DLL disable mode (simple functional representation shown below).

The on-die termination resistors must be disabled by \ncontinuously registering the ODT pin low and/or by programming the RTT_Nom bits MR1{A9,A6,A2} to {0,0,0} via a \nmode register set command during DLL-off mode. \nIn synchronous ODT mode, RTT will be turned on ODTLon clock cycles after ODT is sampled high by a rising clock \nedge  and turned off ODTLoff clock cycles after ODT is registered low by a rising clock edge. The ODT latency is tied \nto the write  latency (WL) by: ODTLon = WL - 2; ODTLoff = WL- 2. \nODT Latency and Posted ODT \nIn synchronous ODT Mode, the Additive Latency (AL) programmed into the Mode Register (MR1) also applies to the \nODT signal. The DRAM internal ODT signal is delayed for a number of clock cycles defined by the Additive Latency \n(AL) relative to the external ODT signal. ODTLon = CWL + AL - 2; ODTLoff = CWL + AL - 2. For details, refer to \nDDR3L SDRAM latency definitions. \nTable 26.

Maximum RTT turn-on time (tAON max) is the point in time when the ODT resistance is \nfully on. Both are measured from ODTLon. \nMinimum RTT turn-off time (tAOF min) is the point in time when the device starts to turn off the ODT resistance. \nMaximum RTT turn off time (tAOF max) is the point in time when the on-die termination has reached high \nimpedance. Both are measured from ODTLoff. \nWhen ODT is asserted, it must remain high until ODTH4 is satisfied. If a Write command is registered by the \nSDRAM with ODT high, then ODT must remain high until ODTH4 (BL=4) or ODTH8 (BL=8) after the write command. \nODTH4 and ODTH8 are measured from ODT registered high to ODT registered low or from the registration of a \nwrite command until ODT is registered low. \nODT during Reads \nAs the DDR3L SDRAM cannot terminate and drive at the same time, RTT must be disabled at least half a clock \ncycle before the read preamble by driving the ODT pin low appropriately. RTT may not be enabled until the end of \nthe post-amble as shown in the following figure. DRAM turns on the termination when it stops driving which is \ndetermined by tHZ. If DRAM stops driving early (i.e. tHZ is early), then tAONmin time may apply. If DRAM stops \ndriving late (i.e. tHZ is late), then DRAM complies with tAONmax timing. Note that ODT may be disabled earlier \nbefore the Read and enabled later after the Read than shown in this example. \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 48 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nFigure 22.

This requirement is supported \nby the “Dynamic ODT” feature as described as follows:  \nFunctional Description \nThe Dynamic ODT Mode is enabled if bit (A9) or (A10) of MR2 is set to ‘1’. The function is described as follows: \nTwo RTT values are available: RTT_Nom and RTT_WR. \n-The value for RTT_Nom is preselected via bits A[9,6,2] in MR1.\n- The value for RTT_WR is preselected via bits A[10,9] in MR2.\nDuring operation without write commands, the termination is controlled as follows: \n- Nominal termination strength RTT_Nom is select ed.\n- Termination on/off timing is controlled via ODT pin and latencies ODTLon and ODTLoff.\nWhen a Write command (WR, WRA, WRS4, WRS8, WRAS4, WRAS8) is registered, and if Dynamic ODT is \nenabled, the termination is controlled as follows: \n- A latency ODTLcnw after the write command, termination strength RTT_WR is selected.\n- A latency ODTLcwn8 (for BL8, fixed by MRS or selected OTF) or ODTLcwn4 (for BC4, fixed by MRS or selected\nOTF) after the write command, termination strength RTT_Nom is selected.\n- Termination on/off timing is controlled via ODT pin and ODTLon, ODTLoff.\nThe following table shows latencies and timing parameters which are relevant for the on-die termination control in \nDynamic ODT mode. \nThe dynamic ODT feature is not supported at DLL-off mode. User must use MRS command to set RTT_WR, MR2 \n[A10,A9 = [0,0], to disable Dynamic ODT externally. \nWhen ODT is asserted, it must remain high until ODTH4 is satisfied. If a Write command is registered by the \nSDRAM with ODT high, then ODT must remain high until ODTH4 (BL=4) or ODTH8 (BL=8) after the Write \ncommand. ODTH4 and ODTH8 are measured from ODT registered high to ODT registered low or from the \nregistration of Write command until ODT is register low. \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 49 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nTable 27.

Based on the power down mode definitions, this is currently Precharge \npower down mode if DLL is disabled during precharge power down by MR0 bit A12. \nIn asynchronous ODT timing mode, internal ODT command is NOT delayed by Additive Latency (AL) relative to the \nexternal ODT command. \nIn asynchronous ODT mode, the following timing parameters apply: tAONPD min/max, tAOFPD min/max. \nMinimum RTT turn-on time (tAONPD min) is the point in time when the device termination circuit leaves high \nimpedance state and ODT resistance begins to turn on. Maximum RTT turn on time (tAONPD max) is the point in \ntime when the ODT resistance is fully on. \ntAONPDmin and tAONPDmax are measured from ODT being sampled high.  \nMinimum RTT turn-off time (tAOFPDmin) is the point in time when the devices termination circuit starts to turn off \nthe ODT resistance. Maximum ODT turn off time (tAOFPDmax) is the point in time when the on-die termination has \nreached high impedance. tAOFPDmin and tAOFPDmax are measured from ODT being sample low. \nTable 28.

The transition period begins with the starting point of tANPD and terminates \nat the end point of tCPDED(min). If there is a Refresh command in progress while CKE goes low, then the transition \nperiod ends at the later one of tRFC(min) after the Refresh command and the end point of tCPDED(min). Please \nnote that the actual starting point at tANPD is excluded from the transition period, and the actual end point at \ntCPDED(min) and tRFC(min, respectively, are included in the transition period. \nODT assertion during the transition period may result in an RTT changes as early as the smaller of tAONPDmin and \n(ODTLon*tck+tAONmin) and as late as the larger of tAONPDmax and (ODTLon*tCK+tAONmax). ODT de-assertion \nduring the transition period may result in an RTT change as early as the smaller of tAOFPDmin and \n(ODTLoff*tCK+tAOFmin) and as late as the larger of tAOFPDmax and (ODTLoff*tCK+tAOFmax). Note that, if AL \nhas a large value, the range where RTT is uncertain becomes quite large. The following figure shows the three \ndifferent cases: ODT_A, synchronous behavior before tANPD; ODT_B has a state change during the transition \nperiod; ODT_C shows a state change after the transition period. \nAsynchronous to Synchronous ODT Mode transition during Power-Down Exit \nIf DLL is selected to be frozen in Precharge Power Down Mode by the setting of bit A12 in MR0 to “0”, there is also a \ntransition period around power down exit, where either synchronous or asynchronous response to a change in ODT \nmust be expected from the DDR3L SDRAM. \nThis transition period starts tANPD before CKE is first registered high, and ends tXPDLL after CKE is first registered \nhigh. tANPD is equal to (WL -1) and is counted (backwards) from the clock cycle where CKE is first registered high. \nODT assertion during the transition period may result in an RTT change as early as the smaller of tAONPDmin and \n(ODTLon* tCK+tAONmin) and as late as the larger of tAONPDmax and (ODTLon*tCK+tAONmax). ODT de-\nassertion during the transition period may result in an RTT change as early as the smaller of tAOFPDmin and \n(ODTLoff*tCK+tAOFmin) and as late as the larger of tAOFPDmax and (ODToff*tCK+tAOFmax). Note that if AL has \na large value, the range where RTT is uncertain becomes quite large. The following figure shows the three different \ncases: ODT_C, asynchronous response before tANPD; ODT_B has a state change of ODT during the transition \nperiod; ODT_A shows a state change of ODT after the transition period with synchronous response. \nAsynchronous to Synchronous ODT Mode during short CKE high and short CKE low periods \nIf the total time in Precharge Power Down state or Idle state is very short, the transition periods for PD entry and PD \nexit may overlap. In this case, the response of the DDR3L SDRAMs RTT to a change in ODT state at the input may \nbe synchronous or asynchronous from the state of the PD entry transition period to the end of the PD exit transition \nperiod (even if the entry ends later than the exit period). \nIf the total time in Idle state is very short, the transition periods for PD exit and PD entry may overlap. In this case, \nthe response of the DDR3L SDRAMs RTT to a change in ODT state at the input may be synchronous or \nasynchronous from the state of the PD exit transition period to the end of the PD entry transition period. Note that in \nthe following figure, it is assumed that there was no Refresh command in progress when Idle state was entered. \nAS4C512M8D3LC\nConfidential\n- 51 of 86 -\nRev.1.0   June  2020\nZQ Calibration Commands \nZQ Calibration Description \nZQ Calibration command is used to calibrate DRAM Ron and ODT values. DDR3L SDRAM needs longer time to \ncalibrate output driver and on-die termination circuits at initialization and relatively smaller time to perform periodic \ncalibrations. \nZQCL command is used to perform the initial calibration during power-up initialization sequence. This command may \nbe issued at any time by the controller depending on the system environment. ZQCL command triggers the \ncalibration engine inside the DRAM and once calibration is achieved the calibrated values are transferred from \ncalibration engine to DRAM IO which gets reflected as updated output driver and on-die termination values. \nThe first ZQCL command issued after reset is allowed a timing period of tZQinit to perform the full calibration and \nthe transfer of values. All other ZQCL commands except the first ZQCL command issued after RESET is allowed a \ntiming period of tZQoper. \nZQCS command is used to perform periodic calibrations to account for voltage and temperature variations. A shorter \ntiming window is provided to perform the calibration and transfer of values as defined by timing parameter tZQCS. \nNo other activities should be performed on the DRAM channel by the controller for the duration of tZQinit, tZQoper, \nor tZQCS. The quiet time on the DRAM channel allows calibration of output driver and on-die termination values. \nOnce DRAM calibration is achieved, the DRAM should disable ZQ current consumption path to reduce power. \nAll banks must be precharged and tRP met before ZQCL or ZQCS commands are issued by the controller. \nZQ calibration commands can also be issued in parallel to DLL lock time when coming out of self refresh. Upon self-\nrefresh exit, DDR3L SDRAM will not perform an IO calibration without an explicit ZQ calibration command. The \nearliest possible time for ZQ Calibration command (short or long) after self refresh exit is tXS. \nIn systems that share the ZQ resistor between devices, the controller must not allow any overlap of tZQoper, tZQinit, \nor tZQCS between ranks. \nFigure 23.

DQS , DQS# have to reach VSEHmin / VSELmax (approximately \nthe ac -levels (VIH(ac) / VIL(ac)) for DQ signals) in every half-cycle proceeding and following a valid transition.  \nNote that the applicable ac-levels for ADD/CMD and DQ’s might be different per speed-bin etc. E.g., if VIH150(ac) \n/VIL150(ac) is used for ADD/CMD signals, then these ac-levels apply also for the single- ended  signals CK and CK#. \nTable 29.

Setup (tIS) nominal slew rate for a falling signal is defined as the slew rate between \nthe last crossing of Vref(dc) and the first crossing of VIL(ac)max. If the actual signal is always earlier than the \nnominal slew rate line between shaded ‘Vref(dc) to ac region’, use nominal slew rate for derating value. If the actual \nsignal is later than the nominal slew rate line anywhere between shaded ‘Vref(dc) to ac region’, the slew rate of the \ntangent line to the actual signal  from the ac level to dc level is used for derating value. \nHold (tIH) nominal slew rate for a rising signal is defined as the slew rate between the last crossing of VIL(dc)max \nand the first crossing of Vref(dc). Hold (tIH) nominal slew rate for a falling signal is defined as the slew rate between \nthe last crossing of VIH(dc)min and the first crossing of Vref(dc). If the actual signal is always later than the nominal \nslew rate line between shaded ‘dc to Vref(dc) region’, use nominal slew rate for derating value. If the actual signal is \nearlier than the nominal slew rate line anywhere between shaded ‘dc to Vref(dc) region’, the slew rate of a tangent \nline to the actual signal from the dc level to Vref(dc) level is used for derating value.  \nFor a valid transition the input signal has to remain above/below VIH/IL(ac) for some time tVAC.  \nAlthough for slow slew rates the total setup time might be negative (i.e. a valid input signal will not have reached \nVIH/IL(ac) at the time of the rising clock transition) a valid input signal is still required to complete the transition and \nreach VIH/IL(ac). \nFor slew rates in between the values listed in the following tables, the derating values may be obtained by linear \ninterpolation. \nThese values are typically not subject to production test. They are verified by design and characterization\nTable 40.
