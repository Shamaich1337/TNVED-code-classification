It combines bothcurrent-to-voltage and A/D conversion so that eight\nlow-level current output devices, such as photodiodes, can\nbe directly connected to its inputs and digitized.\nFor each of the eight inputs, the DDC118 provides a\ndual-switched integrator front-end. This design allows forcontinuous current integration: while one integrator isbeing digitized by the onboard A/D converter, the other is\nintegrating the input current. Adjustable full-scale ranges\nfrom 12pC to 350pC and adjustable integration times from\n50µs to 1s allow currents from fAs to µAs to be measured\nwith outstanding precision. Low-level linearity is ±0.5ppm\nof the full-scale range and noise is 5.2ppm of the full-scale\nrange.\nTwo modes of operation are provided. In Low-Power\nmode, total power dissipation is only 13.5mW per channel\nwith a maximum data rate of 2.5kSPS. High-Speed modesupports data rates up to 3.125kSPS with a corresponding\ndissipation of 18mW per channel.\nThe DDC118 has a serial interface designed for\ndaisy-chaining in multi-device systems. Simply connect\nthe output of one device to the input of the next to create\nthe chain. Common clocking feeds all the devices in thechain so that the digital overhead in a multi-DDC118system is minimal.\nThe DDC118 is a single-supply device using a +5V analog\nsupply and supporting a +2.7V to +5.25V digital supply.Operating over the industrial temperature range of −40 °C\nto +85 °C, the DDC118 is offered in a QFN-48 package.DDC118\nSBAS325B − JUNE 2004 − REVISED APRIL 2009\nOctal Current Input, 20-Bit\nAnalog-To-Digital Converter\nwww.ti.comCopyright \uf8e9 2002−2009, T exas Instruments IncorporatedPlease be aware that an important notice concerning availability, standard warranty, and use in critical applications of T exasInstruments\nsemiconductor products and disclaimers thereto appears at the end of this data sheet.\nAll trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\n/C0080/C0082/C0079/C0068/C0085/C0067/C0084/C0073/C0079/C0078  /C0068/C0065/C0084/C0065  /C0105/C0110/C0102/C0111/C0114/C0109/C0097/C0116/C0105/C0111/C0110  /C0105/C0115 /C0099/C0117/C0114/C0114/C0101/C0110/C0116  /C0097/C0115 /C0111/C0102 /C0112/C0117/C0098/C0108/C0105/C0099/C0097/C0116/C0105/C0111/C0110  /C0100/C0097/C0116/C0101/C0046  /C0080/C0114/C0111/C0100/C0117/C0099/C0116/C0115\n/C0099/C0111/C0110/C0102/C0111/C0114/C0109  /C0116/C0111 /C0115/C0112/C0101/C0099/C0105/C0102/C0105/C0099/C0097/C0116/C0105/C0111/C0110/C0115  /C0112/C0101/C0114 /C0116/C0104/C0101 /C0116/C0101/C0114/C0109/C0115  /C0111/C0102 /C0084/C0101/C0120/C0097/C0115  /C0073/C0110/C0115/C0116/C0114/C0117/C0109/C0101/C0110/C0116/C0115  /C0115/C0116/C0097/C0110/C0100/C0097/C0114/C0100  /C0119/C0097/C0114/C0114/C0097/C0110/C0116/C0121/C0046\n/C0080/C0114/C0111/C0100/C0117/C0099/C0116/C0105/C0111/C0110  /C0112/C0114/C0111/C0099/C0101/C0115/C0115/C0105/C0110/C0103  /C0100/C0111/C0101/C0115  /C0110/C0111/C0116 /C0110/C0101/C0099/C0101/C0115/C0115/C0097/C0114/C0105/C0108/C0121  /C0105/C0110/C0099/C0108/C0117/C0100/C0101  /C0116/C0101/C0115/C0116/C0105/C0110/C0103  /C0111/C0102 /C0097/C0108/C0108 /C0112/C0097/C0114/C0097/C0109/C0101/C0116/C0101/C0114/C0115/C0046\n/C0068/C0068/C0067/C0049/C0049/C0056\nSBAS325B − JUNE 2004 − REVISED APRIL 2009www.ti.com\n2ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS (1)\nAnalog Input Current 750 µA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nAVDD to DVDD −0.3V to +6V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nAVDD to AGND −0.3V to +6V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nDVDD to DGND −0.3V to +6V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nAGND to DGND ±0.2V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nVREF Input to AGND 2.0V to AVDD + 0.3V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nAnalog Input to AGND −0.3V to +0.7V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nDigital Input Voltage to DGND −0.3V to DVDD + 0.3V . . . . . . . . . . . \nDigital Output Voltage to DGND −0.3V to AVDD + 0.3V . . . . . . . . . \nOperating Temperature −40 °C to +85 °C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nStorage Temperature −60 °C to +150 °C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nJunction Temperature (T J) +150 °C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n(1)Stresses above these ratings may cause permanent damage.\nExposure to absolute maximum conditions for extended periods\nmay degrade device reliability.

Each input has\ntwo integrators so that the current-to-voltage integrationcan be continuous in time. The output of the sixteenintegrators are switched to four delta-sigma ( ∆Σ)\nconverters via four four-input multiplexers. With theDDC118 in the continuous integration mode, the output of\nthe integrators from one side of the inputs will be digitized\nwhile the other eight integrators are in the integrationmode, as illustrated in the timing diagram in Figure 2. This\nintegration and A/D conversion process is controlled by\nthe system clock, CLK. The results from side A and side\nB of each signal input are stored in a serial output shiftregister. The DVALID\n output goes low when the shift\nregister contains valid data.\nDual\nSwitched\nIntegratorDual\nSwitched\nIntegrator∆Σ\nModulatorDigital\nFilter\nDigital\nInput/OutputFORMAT\nDCLK\nDCLK\nDVALID\nDOUT\nDOUT\nDIN\nDINControl\nIN3IN1VREF\nDGNDDVDD\nAGNDAVDD\nDual\nSwitched\nIntegrator\nDual\nSwitched\nIntegrator∆Σ\nModulatorDigital\nFilter\nIN4IN2\nDual\nSwitched\nIntegratorDual\nSwitched\nIntegrator∆Σ\nModulatorDigital\nFilter\nIN7IN5\nDual\nSwitched\nIntegratorDual\nSwitched\nIntegrator∆Σ\nModulatorDigital\nFilter\nIN8IN6CLK\nCONV\nRANGE0\nRANGE1\nRANGE2TESTCLK_4XHISPD/LOPWRRESET\nFigure 1.

The DDC118 contains only four A/D converters, so\nthe conversion process is interleaved (see Figure 2). Theintegration and conversion process is fundamentally\nindependent of the data retrieval process. Consequently,\nthe CLK frequency and DCLK frequencies need not be thesame. DIN and DIN\n are only used when multiple\nconverters are cascaded, and otherwise should both be\ntied to DGND.\nDEVICE OPERATION\nBasic Integration Cycle\nThe topology of the front end of the DDC118 is an analogintegrator as shown in Figure 3. In this diagram, only Input\nIN1 is shown. This representation of the input stageconsists of an operational amplifier, a selectable feedback\ncapacitor network (C\nF), and several switches thatimplement the integration cycle. The timing relationships\nof all of the switches shown in Figure 3 are illustrated in\nFigure 4. Figure 4 is used to conceptualize the operationof the integrator input stage of the DDC118 and should notbe used as an exact timing tool for design. See Figure 5 for\nthe block diagrams of the reset, integrate, wait and convert\nstates of the integrator section of the DDC118. Thisinternal switching network is controlled externally with the\nconvert pin (CONV), range selection pins\n(RANGE0-RANGE2), and the system clock (CLK). For the\nbest noise performance, CONV must be synchronizedwith the rising edge of CLK. It is recommended that CONV\ntoggle within ±10ns of the rising edge of CLK.\nThe noninverting inputs of the integrators are connected to\nground. Consequently, the DDC118 analog ground should\nbe as clean as possible. The range switches, along withthe internal and external capacitors (C\nF), are shown in\nparallel between the inverting input and output of the\noperational amplifier. At the beginning of a conversion, the\nswitches S A/D, SINTA, SINTB, SREF1, SREF2, and SRESET\nare set (see Figure 4).\nIN1, IN2,IN5, and IN6,\nIntegrator A\nIN1, IN2,IN5, and IN6,\nIntegrator B\nIN3, IN4,IN7, and IN8,\nIntegrator A\nIN3, IN4,IN7, and IN8,\nIntegrator B\nConversioninProgress\nDVALIDIN1B\nIN2B\nIN5B\nIN6BIN3B\nIN4B\nIN7B\nIN8BIN1A\nIN2A\nIN5A\nIN6AIntegrateIntegrateIntegrate\nIntegrate\nIntegrateIntegrateIntegrate\nIntegrate\nIN3A\nIN4A\nIN7A\nIN8AIN1B\nIN2B\nIN5B\nIN6BIN3B\nIN4B\nIN7B\nIN8BIN1A\nIN2A\nIN5A\nIN6AIN3A\nIN4A\nIN7A\nIN8A\nFigure 2.

In this manner, the selected\ncapacitor is charged to the reference voltage, VREF. Once\nthe integration capacitor is charged, S REF1 and SRESET\nare switched so that VREF is no longer connected to theamplifier circuit while it waits to begin integrating (seeFigure 5b). With the rising edge of CONV, S\nINTA closes,\nwhich begins the integration of side A. This process puts\nthe integrator stage into its integrate mode (see Figure 5c).\nCharge from the input signal is collected on the integration\ncapacitor, causing the voltage output of the amplifier to\ndecrease. The falling edge of CONV stops the integration\nby switching the input signal from side A to side B (S INTA\nand SINTB). Prior to the falling edge of CONV, the signal on\nside B was converted by the A/D converter and reset\nduring the time that side A was integrating. With the falling\nedge of CONV, side B starts integrating the input signal.\nNow the output voltage of the side A operational amplifier\nis presented to the input of the ∆Σ A/D converter (see\nFigure 5d).\nIntegration Capacitors\nThere are eight different capacitors available on-chip forboth sides of every channel in the DDC118. These internal\ncapacitors are trimmed in production to achieve the\nspecified performance for range error of the DDC118. The\nrange control pins (RANGE0-RANGE2) change thecapacitor value for all four integrators. Consequently, allinputs and both sides of each input will always have the\nsame full-scale range.  Table 1 shows the capacitor value\nselected for each range selection.\nTable 1.

During this sampling, the externalreference must supply the charge needed by the ∆Σ\nconverter. For an integration time of 400 µs, this charge\ntranslates to an average VREF current of approximately\n150µA. The amount of charge needed by the ∆Σ converter\nis independent of the integration time; therefore,\nincreasing the integration time lowers the average current.\nFor example, an integration time of 800 µs lowers the\naverage VREF current to 75 µA.\nIt is critical that VREF be s table during the different modes\nof operation (see Figure 5). The ∆Σ converter measures\nthe voltage on the integrator with respect to VREF. Sincethe integrator capacitors are initially reset to VREF, anydrop in VREF from the time the capacitors are reset to the\ntime when the converter measures the integrator output\nwill introduce an offset. It is also important that VREF bestable over longer periods of time because changes inVREF correspond directly to changes in the full-scale\nrange. Finally, VREF should introduce as little additional\nnoise as possible.\nFor these reasons, it is strongly recommended that the\nexternal reference source be buffered  with an operational\namplifier, as shown in Figure 6. In this circuit, the voltage\nreference is generated by a 4.096V reference.\n A low-pass\nfilter to reduce noise connects the reference to an\noperational amplifier configured as a buffer. This amplifier\nshould have low noise, and input/output common-moderanges that support VREF. Following the buffer arecapacitors placed close to the DDC118 VREF pin. Even\nthough the circuit in Figure 6 might appear to be unstable\nbecause of the large output capacitors, it works well formost operational amplifiers. It is NOT recommended thatseries resistance be placed in the output lead to improve\nstability since this can cause a drop in VREF, which\nproducing large offsets.\n0.10 µF+5V\n10kΩ\n10µF432\n31\n27\n6\n+\n0.10 µF0.1µF 10µF+OPA3500.47 µF+5V\nTo VREF\nP in10of\ntheDDC118 REF3140\nFigure 6.

By adjusting T\nINT, the\nuser can change the 3dB bandwidth and the location of the\nnotches in the response. The frequency response of the\n∆Σ converter that follows the front end integrator is of no\nconsequence because the converter samples a held\nsignal from the integrators. That is, the input to the ∆Σ\nconverter is always a DC signal. Since the output of thefront end integrators are sampled, aliasing can occur.Whenever the frequency of the input signal exceeds\none-half of the sampling rate, the signal will fold back down\nto lower frequencies.\n0\n−10\n−20\n−30\n−40\n−50\n0.1\nTINT100\nTINT1\nTINT10\nTINT\nFrequencyGain (dB)\nFigure 7. Frequency Res ponse of the DDC118Test Mode\nWhen Test Mode is used, the inputs (IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4,\nIN5, IN6, IN7, and IN8) are disconnected from the DDC118\nintegrators to enable the user to measure a zero inputsignal regardless of the current supplied to the inputs. In\naddition, packets of charge can be transferred to the\nintegrators in 11pC intervals to measure non-zero values.\nThe test mode works with both the continuous andnon-continuous modes. The timing diagram for the test\nmode is shown in Figure 8 with the timing specifications\ngiven in Table 2.\nTo enter Test Mode, hold TEST high while CONV\ntransitions. If TEST is held high during the entireintegration period, the integrators measure a zero value.This mode can be used to help debug a design or perform\ndiagnostic tests. To apply packets of charge during Test\nMode, simply strobe TEST low then high before the nextCONV transition. Each rising edge of TEST causesapproximately 11pC of charge to be transferred to the\nintegrators. This charge transfer is independent of the\nintegration time. Data retrieval during Test Mode isidentical to normal operation. To exit Test Mode, take\nTEST low and allow several cycles after exiting before\nusing the data.\nt1t3t4t4 t6\nt5t2Action\nCONV\nTESTIntegrateB IntegrateATest Mode Disabled\n0pC into B 11pC into A 22pC into B 33pC into ATestMode Disabled Test Mode Enabled: InputsDisconnected\nIntegrateB IntegrateA\nFigure 8.

The DDC118 contains only four A/D converters, so\nthe conversion process is interleaved (see Figure 2,\npage 9). The integration and conversion processes areindependent of the data retrieval process. Consequently,the CLK frequency and DCLK frequencies need not be the\nsame. DIN and DIN\n are used when multiple converters are\ncascaded. Cascading or daisy-chaining  greatly simplifies\nthe interconnection and routing of the digital outputs incases where a large number of converters are needed.\nRefer to the Cascading Multiple Converters  section of this\ndata sheet for more detail.\nComplementary Signals (DCLK , DIN, and DOUT )\nThe DDC118 provides optional complementary inputs\n(DCLK, DIN) to help reduce digital coupling to the analog\ninputs. If using these inputs, connect a complementarysignal to each. If these inputs are not connected on the\nDDC118, they should be tied to DGND. DOUT\n is a\ncomplementary output designed to drive DIN . If not using\nDOUT, leave it floating.\nSystem and Data Clocks (CLK and CONV)\nThe system clock is supplied to CLK and the data clock issupplied to DCLK. Make sure the clock signals areclean—avoid overshoot or ringing. For best performance,\ngenerate both clocks from the same clock source. DCLK\nshould be disabled by taking it low after the data has been\nshifted out or while CONV is transitioning.\nWhen using multiple DDC118s, pay close attention to the\nDCLK distribution on the printed circuit board (PCB). Inparticular, make sure to minimize skew in the DCLK signal\nas this can lead to timing violations in the serial interface\nspecifications. See the Cascading Multiple Converters\nsection for more details.\nSystem Clock Divider (CLK_4X)\nThe CLK_4X input enables an internal divider on the\nsystem clock as shown in T able 3.  When CLK_4X = 1, the\nsystem clock is divided by four. This allows a 4X fastersystem clock, which in turn provides a finer quantization of\nthe integration time as the CONV signal needs to be\nsynchronized with the system clock for the best\nperformance.\nTable 3.

With HISPD/LOPWR\n = 0,\nthe Low-Power Mode is selected with a typical 13.5mW/channel and a maximum data rate of 2.5kSPS. Setting\nHISPD/LOPWR\n = 1 selects the High-Speed Mode, which\nsupports a maximum data rate of 3.125kSPS with a corre-\nsponding typical power of 18.0mW/channel.\nTable 4.

Data\nretrieval may begin after DVALID  goes low. This signal is\ngenerated using an internal clock divided down from thesystem clock CLK. The phase relationship between this\ninternal clock and CLK is set when power is first applied\nand is random. Since the user must synchronize CONVwith CLK, the DVALID\n signal will have a random phase\nrelationship with CONV. This uncertainty is ± 1/fCLK.\nPolling DVALID  eliminates any concern about this\nrelationship. If data read back is timed from CONV, wait the\nmaximum value of t 7 or t8 to insure data is valid.\nReset (RESET )\nThe DDC118 is reset asynchronously by taking the\nRESET input low, as shown in Figure 9. Make sure the\nreset pulse is at least 50 µs wide. After resetting the\nDDC118, wait at least four conversions before using thedata. It is very important to make sure the RESET\n is glitch\nfree to avoid unintended resets.

The A/D conversion\ntime is primarily a function of the system clock (CLK)\nspeed. One A/D conversion cycle encompasses theconversion of two signals (one side of each dual integrator\nfeeding the modulator) and the reset time for each of the\nintegrators involved in the two conversions. In most\nsituations, the A/D conversion time is shorter than theintegration time. If this condition exists, the DDC118 willoperate in the continuous mode. When the DDC118 is in\nthe continuous mode, the sensor output is continuously\nintegrated by one of the two sides of each input.\nIn the event that the A/D conversion takes longer than the\nintegration time, the DDC118 will switch into a\nnon-continuous mode. In non-continuous mode, the A/D\nconverter is not able to keep pace with the speed of theintegration process. Consequently, the integrationprocess is periodically halted until the digitizing process\ncatches up. These two basic modes of operation for the\nDDC118—continuous and non-continuous modes—aredescribed below.\nContinuous and Non-Continuous Operational\nModes\nFigure 10 shows the state diagram of the DDC118. In all,\nthere are eight states. T able 5 provides a brief explanation\nof each state.\nTable 5. State Descriptions\nSTATE MODE DESCRIPTION\n1Ncont Complete m/r/az of side A, then side B (if previous\nstate is state 4).

Initial power-up state when CONV\nis initially held LOW.\nFour signals are used to control progression around the\nstate diagram: CONV, mbsy, and their complements. Thestate machine uses the level as opposed to the edges of\nCONV to control the progression. mbsy is an internally-\ngenerated signal not available to the user. It is activewhenever a measurement/reset/auto-zero (m/r/az) cycleis in progress.IntA/MeasB\nCont5CONV ×mbsyCONV ×mbsy\nCONV ×mbsy\nCONV ×mbsy\nCONV ×mbsyCONV ×mbsy\nCONV\nCONV\nIntB/MeasA\nCont4Ncont1\nNcont2\nIntA\nCont3\nNcont8\nNcont7IntB\nCont6CONV\nCONVCONV|mbsy\nCONV|mbsy\nFigure 10. Integrate/M easure State Diagram\nDuring the cont mode, mbsy is not active when CONV\ntoggles. The non-integrating side is always ready to begin\nintegrating when the other side finishes its integration.\nConsequently, monitoring the current status of CONV is all\nthat is needed to know the current state. Cont modeoperation corresponds to states 3-6. Two of the states, 3and 6, only perform an integration (no m/r/az cycle).\nmbsy becomes important when operating in the ncont\nmode, states 1, 2, 7, and 8. Whenever CONV is toggledwhile mbsy is active, the DDC118 will enter or remain ineither ncont state 1 (or 8). After mbsy goes inactive, state\n2 (or 7) is entered. This state prepares the appropriate side\nfor integration. In the ncont states, the inputs to theDDC118 are grounded.\nOne interesting observation from the state diagram is that\nthe integrations always alternate between sides A and B.\nThis relationship holds for any CONV pattern and isindependent of the mode. States 2 and 7 insure thisrelationship during the ncont mode.\nWhen power is first applied to the DDC118, the beginning\nstate is either 1 or 8, depending on the initial level of CONV.\nFor CONV held high at power-up, the beginning state is 1.\nConversely, for CONV held low at power-up, the beginning\nstate is 8. In general, there is a symmetry in the state\ndiagram between states 1-8, 2-7, 3-6, and 4-5. Inverting\nCONV results in the states progressing through theirsymmetrical match.\n/C0068/C0068/C0067/C0049/C0049/C0056\nSBAS325B − JUNE 2004 − REVISED APRIL 2009www.ti.com\n15TIMING EXAMPLES\nCont Mode\nA few timing diagrams help illustrate the operation of the\nstate machine. These diagrams are shown in Figure 11through Figure 19. Table 6 gives generalized timingspecifications in units of CLK periods for CLK_4X = 0. If\nCLK_4X = 1, these values increase by a factor of four\nbecause of the internal clock divider. Values (in µs) for\nTable 6 can be easily found for a given CLK. For example,\nif CLK = 4MHz, then a CLK period = 0.25 µs. t\n6 in Table 6\nwould then be 367.50 ± 0.125 µs.\nTable 6. Timing Specifications Generalized in\nCLK Periods\nSYMBOL DESCRIPTIONVALUE\n(CLK periods with CLK_4X = 0)\nt6Cont mode m/r/az cycle 1470 ± 0.5\nt7Cont mode data ready 1380 ± 0.5\nt81st ncont mode data ready 1379 ± 1\nt92nd ncont mode data ready 1450\nt10Ncont mode m/r/az cycle 2901 ± 1\nFigure 11 shows a few integration cycles beginning with\ninitial power-up for a cont mode example. The top signal\nis CONV and is supplied by the user. The next lineindicates the current state in the state diagram. The\nfollowing two traces show when integrations andmeasurement cycles are underway. The internal signal\nmbsy is shown next. Finally, DVALID\n is given. DVALID\ngoes active low when data is ready to be retrieved from the\nDDC118. It stays low until DCLK is taken high and thenback low by the user. The text below the DVALID\n pulse\nindicates the side of the data available to be read, and\narrows help match the data to the correspondingintegration. The signals illustrated in Figure 11 through\nFigure 19 are drawn at approximately the same scale.\nIn Figure 11, the first state is ncont state 8. The DDC118\nalways powers up in the ncont mode. In this case, the first\nstate is 8 because CONV is initially low. After the first two\nstates, cont mode operation is reached and the statesbegin toggling between 4 and 5. From now on, the input is\nbeing continuously integrated, either on side A or side B.\nThe time needed for the m/r/az cycle, or t\n6, is the same time\nthat determines the boundary between the cont and ncont\nmodes described earlier in the Overview section. DVALID\ngoes low after CONV toggles in time t 7, indicating that data\nis ready to be retrieved. As shown in Figure 11, there aretwo values for t\n6 and t7. The reason for this is discussed in\nthe Special Considerations  section.\nSee Figure 12 for the timing diagram of the internal\noperations occurring during continuous mode operation.Table 7 gives the timing specifications in the continuous\nmode.\nSYMBOL DESCRIPTION VALUE (CLK = 4MHz, CLK_4X = 0) VALUE (CLK = 4.8MHz, CLK_4X = 0)\nt6 Cont Mode m/r/az Cycle 367.50 ± 0.125 µs 306.25 ± 0.104 µs\nt7 Cont Mode Data Ready 345.00 ± 0.125 µs 287.5 ± 0.104 µs\nFigure 11.

It is not recommended to use Range 0 whenoperating in non-continuous mode. Figure 13 illustratesoperation in the ncont mode. The integrations come in\npairs (that is, sides A/B or sides B/A) followed by a time\nduring which no integrations occur. During that time, theprevious integrations are being measured, reset and\nauto-zeroed. Before the DDC118 can advance to states 3\nor 6, both sides A and B must be finished with the m/r/azcycle which takes time t\n10. When the m/r/az cycles are\ncompleted, time t11 is needed to prepare the next side for\nintegration. This time is required for the ncont mode\nbecause the m/r/az cycle of the ncont mode is slightlydifferent from that of the cont mode. After the firstintegration ends, DVALID\n goes low in time t 8. This time is\nthe same as in the cont mode. The second data will be\nready in time t9 after the first data is ready. One result of the\nnaming convention used in this data sheet is that when the\nDDC118 is operating in the ncont mode , it passes through\nboth ncont mode states  and cont mode states . For\nexample, in Figure 13, the state pattern is 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4,1, 2, 3, 4 ... where 3 and 4 are cont mode states. Ncont\nmode, by definition, means that for some portion of the\ntime, neither side A nor B is integrating. States that perform\nan integration are labeled cont mode states , while those\nthat do not are called ncont mode states . Since\nintegrations are performed in the ncont mode, just not\ncontinuously, some cont mode states must be used in ancont mode state pattern.\nSYMBOL DESCRIPTION VALUE (CLK = 4MHz, CLK_4X = 0) VALUE (CLK = 4.8MHz, CLK_4X = 0)\nt8 1st ncont Mode Data Ready 344.75 ± 0.25 µs 287.292 ± 0.208 µs\nt9 2nd ncont Mode Data Ready 362.5 µs 302.083 µs\nt10 ncont Mode m/r/az Cycle 725.25 ± 0.25 µs 604.375 ± 0.208 µs\nt11 Prepare Side for Integration ≥18µs ≥15µs\nFigure 13.

Upon entering states 1 or 8, the DDC118 remains\nin those states until mbsy goes low, independent of CONV.\nAs long as the m/r/az cycle is underway, the state machine\nignores CONV (see Figure 10, page 14). The top two\nsignals in Figure 16 are different CONV patterns thatproduce the same state. This feature allows flexibility in\ngenerating ncont mode CONV patterns. For example, the\nDDC118 Evaluation Fixture operates in the ncont mode by\ngenerating a square wave with pulse width < t\n6. Figure 17\nillustrates operation in the ncont mode using a 50% dutycycle CONV signal with T INT= 512 CLK periods. Care\nmust be exercised when using a square wave to generate\nCONV. There are certain integration times that must beavoided sinc e they produce very short intervals for state 2\n(or state 7 if CONV is inverted). As seen in the state\ndiagram, the state progresses from 2 to 3 as soon as\nCONV is high. The state machine does not insure that the\nduration of state 2 is long enough to properly prepare the\nnext side for integration (t\n11). This must be done by the\nuser with proper timing of CONV. For example, if CONV is\na square wave with T INT=970 CLK periods, state 2 will\nonly be 9 CLK periods long; therefore, t 11 will not be met.\nCONV1\nCONV2\n23 1 34 4 1 2 Statembsy\nFigure 16.

Figure 18 shows an example of this transition.\nIn this figure, the cont mode is entered when the integrationon side A is completed before the m/r/az cycle on side B\nis complete. The DDC118 completes the measurement on\nsides B and A during states 8 and 7 with the input signalshorted to ground. Ncont integration begins with state 6.Changing from the ncont to cont mode occurs when T\nINT\nis increased so that T INT is always ≥ t6, as shown in\nFigure 19 (see also Figure 14 and Table 8, page 18). With\na longer T INT, the m/r/az cycle has enough time to finish\nbefore the next integration begins and continuous\nintegration of the input signal is possible. For the special\ncase of the very first integration when changing to the cont\nmode, T INT can be < t 6. This is allowed because there is\nno simultaneous  m/r/az cycle on the side B during state\n3—there is no need to wait for it to finish before ending the\nintegration on side A.\nCONV\n87 45\nContinuous Non−Continuous5 65 State\nIntegration\nStatus\nm/r/az\nStatus\nmbsym/r/az B m/r/az A m/r/az B m/r/az A m/r/az BIntegrateA IntegrateB IntA IntA IntB\nFigure 18.

The digital input pin FORMAT selects\nhow many bits are used in the output word. WhenFORMAT is high (1), 20 bits are used. When FORMAT is\nlow (0), the lower 4 bits are truncated so that only 16 bits\nare used. Note that the LSB size is 16 times bigger whenFORMAT = 0. An offset is included in the output to allowslightly negative inputs, from board leakages for example,\nfrom clipping the reading. This offset is approximately\n0.4% of the positive full-scale.\nTable 9.

Data is shifted out on the falling edge of the data\nclock, DCLK.  Make sure not to retrieve data while CONV\nchanges as this can introduce noise.  Stop activity onDCLK at least 10 µs before or after a CONV transition.\nSetting the FORMAT pin = 0 (16-bit output word) reduces\nthe time needed to retrieve data by 20%, since there arefewer bits to shift out. This time reduction can be useful in\nmultichannel systems requiring only 16 bits of resolution.\nCLK\nDVALID\nDCLK\nDOUTt18\nt19\nt21t20\nInput8\nMSBInput1\nLSBInput 8\nLSBInput7\nMSBInput5\nLSBInput 4\nMSBInput2\nLSBInput1\nMSBInput8\nMSBt20\nFigure 20.

The maximum numberof DDC118s that can be daisy-chained together (FORMAT\n= high) is calculated by Equation 3:\n333.125 /C0109s\n160/C0116DCLK\nNOTE: 128 τDCLK is used for FORMAT = low.\nFor DCLK = 10MHz, the maximum number of DDC118s is\n20 (or 26 for FORMAT = low).\nSYMBOL DESCRIPTIONCLK = 4MHz, CLK_4X = 0 CLK = 4.8MHz, CLK_4X = 0\nUNITS SYMBOL DESCRIPTIONMIN TYP MAX MIN TYP MAXUNITS\nt26Hold Time that DOUT is V alid Before Falling Edge of DVALID 1.75 1.458 µs\nt27Cont Mode Data Ready 345.00 ± 0.125 287.5 ± 0.104 µs\nt29Data Retrieval Start-Up After Edge of CONV 10 10 µs\nFigure 24.

Nearly all of\nTINT is available for data retrieval. Figure 25 illustrates\nhow this is done by combining the two previous methods.\nRetrieval during CONV toggling to prevent digital noise, as\ndiscussed previously, and finished before the next data is\nready. The maximum number of DDC118s that can be\ndaisy-chained together (FORMAT = high) is:\nTINT/C004220/C0109s/C00421.75 /C0109s\n160/C0116DCLK\nNOTE: 128 τDCLK is used for FORMAT = low.\nFor TINT = 400 µs and DCLK = 10MHz, the maximum\nnumber of DDC118s is 23 (or 29 for FORMAT = low).RETRIEVAL: NONCONTINUOUS MODE\nRetrieving in noncontinuous mode is slightly different,compared to the continuous mode. As illustrated inFigure 26, DVALID\n goes low in time t 30 after the first\nintegration completes. If T INT is shorter than this time, all\nof t31 is available to retrieve data before the other side data\nis ready. For T INT > t30, the first integration data is ready\nbefore the second integration completes. Data retrieval\nmust be delayed until the second integration completes,\nleaving less time available for retrieval. The time available\nis t31 – (TINT – t30). The second integration’ s data must be\nretrieved before the next round of integration begins. This\ntime is highly dependent on the pattern used to generateCONV. As with the continuous mode, data retrieval musthalt before and after CONV toggles (t\n28, t29) and be\ncompleted before new data is ready (t 26).\nSYMBOL DESCRIPTIONCLK = 4MHZ, CLK_4X = 0 CLK = 4.8MHZ, CLK_4X = 0\nUNITS SYMBOL DESCRIPTIONMIN TYP MAX MIN TYP MAXUNITS\nt26Hold Time that DOUT is V alid Before Falling Edge of DVALID 1.75 1.458 µs\nt28Data Retrieval Shutdown Before Edge of CONV 10 10 µs\nt29Data Retrieval Start-Up After Edge of CONV 10 10 µs\nFigure 25.

(See Figure 28 and Table 12.) Wait for time\nt33 to begin applying the digital signals CONV and CLK.\nThe first CONV pulse will complete the release state and\nbegin integration.\nLAYOUT\nPOWER SUPPLIES AND GROUNDING\nBoth AVDD and DVDD should be as quiet as possible. Itis particularly important to eliminate noise from AVDD thatis non-synchronous with the DDC118 operation. Figure 27illustrates two acceptable ways to supply power to the\nDDC118. The fir st case shows two separate +5V supplies\nfor AVDD and DVDD. In this case, each +5V supply of theDDC118 should be bypassed with 10 µF solid tantalum\ncapacitors and 0.1 µF ceramic capacitors. The second\ncase shows the DVDD power supply derived from the\nAVDD supply with a < 10 Ω isolation resistor. In both cases,\nthe 0.1 µF capacitors should be placed as close to the\nDDC118 package as possible. It is recommended that\nboth the analog and digital grounds (AGND and DGND) be\nconnected to a single ground plane on the printed circuitboard (PCB).\nTHERMAL PAD\nIt is strongly recommended that the thermal pad on theDDC118 be connected to ground on the PCB. No PCBtraces should be routed underneath the thermal pad.DDC118\n0.1µF<10 Ω10µF+5V\nOne +5V SupplyAVDD\nDVDD\nAVDD\nDVDDAGND\nDGND\nAGND\nDGNDDDC118\n0.1µF0.1µF\n0.1µF10µFVA\nSeparateSupplies10µFVD\nFigure 27.

It is essential to make short, directinterconnections and avoid stray wiring\ncapacitance—particularly at the analog input pins. Digital\nsignals should be kept as far from the analog input signals\nas possible on the PCB.\nInput shielding practices should be taken into\nconsideration when designing the circuit layout for the\nDDC118. The inputs to the DDC118 are high impedanceand extremely sensitive to extraneous noise. Leakagecurrents between the PCB traces can exceed the input\nbias current of the DDC118 if shielding is not implemented.\nFigure 29 illustrates an acceptable approach to thisproblem. A PC ground plane is placed around the inputsof the DDC118. This shield helps minimize coupled noise\ninto the input pins.\nThis approach reduces leakage effects by surrounding\nthese sensitive pins with a low impedance analog ground.\nLeakage currents from other portions of the circuit will flow\nharmlessly to the low impedance analog ground ratherthan into the analog input stage of the DDC118.\n36\n353433\n32\n313029\n2827\n26251234\n5\n678\n9\n10\n111248 47 46 45 44 43 42 41 40 39 38\n13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\nIN4 IN3Digital I/O andDigitalPower\nAnalog\nGroundAnalog\nGroundAnalog\nGround\nIN2 IN137\n24DDC118\nIN7 IN8 IN5 IN6AnalogPower\nFigure 29.
