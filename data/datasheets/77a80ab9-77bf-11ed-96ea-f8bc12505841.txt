#### Description:
The Single-Mode Fused Coupler is a high-performance optical component designed for splitting or combining optical signals in fiber optic applications. This specific model features an 80/20 coupling ratio, meaning it transmits 80% of the input power to one output and 20% to the other. It is constructed using SMF-28e fiber, which is optimized for low loss and high bandwidth.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Fiber Amplifiers:** Used to amplify optical signals in telecommunications and data transmission systems.
- **Fiber Lasers:** Essential in laser applications where precise control of light power is required.
- **Optical Labs:** Utilized in research and development settings for experiments involving light manipulation and measurement.

This coupler is particularly noted for its low excess loss, low insertion loss, and high stability, making it suitable for high-power applications in demanding environments.
