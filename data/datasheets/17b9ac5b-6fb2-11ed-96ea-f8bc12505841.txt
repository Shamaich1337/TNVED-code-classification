The part incorporates a power-on \nreset circuit that ensures the DAC output powers up to 0 V or midscale ( AD5663BRMZ-1) and remains there until a valid \nwrite takes place. The part contains a power-down feature that \nreduces the current consumption of the device to 480 nA at 5 V \nand provides software-selectable output loads while in power-\ndown mode. \nThe low power consumption of this part in normal operation \nmakes it ideally suited to portable, battery-operated equipment. \nThe power consumption is 1.25 mW at 5 V , going down to \n2.4 μW in power-down mode. \nThe on-chip precision output amplifier of the AD5663 allows \nrail-to-rail output swing to be achieved. The AD5663 uses a versatile, 3-wire serial interface that \noperates at clock rates up to 50 MHz and is compatible with \nstandard SPI®, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™, and DSP interface \nstandards. PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Dual 16-bit DAC; relative accuracy of ±12 LSBs maximum. \n2. Available in 10-lead MSOP and 10-lead, 3 mm × 3 mm \nLFCSP_WD packages. \n3. Low power; typically consumes 0.6 mW at 3 V and  1.25 mW at 5 V .  \n4. 7 μs maximum settling time.  \n \n \nAD5663  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

The output amplifier has rail -to-rail operation.  \n2 2 VOUTB Analog Output Voltage from DAC B. The output amplifier has rail -to-rail operation.  \n3 3 GND  Ground Reference Point for All Circuitry on the Device .  \n4 4 LDAC  Pulsing this pin low a llows any or all DAC registers to be updated if the input registers have new data. This \nallows simultaneous update of all DAC outputs. Alternatively, this pin can be tied permanently low.  \n5 5 CLR Asynchronous Clear Input. The CLR input is falling edge sensitive. While CLR is low, all LDAC  pulses are \nignored. When CLR is activated, zero scale is loaded to all input and DAC registers. This clears the \noutput to 0 V. The device  exits clear code mode on the 24th falling edge of the next write to the  \ndevice . If CLR is activated during a write sequence, the write is aborted. \n6 6 SYNC  Active Low Control Input. This is the frame synchro nization signal for the input data. When SYNC  goes \nlow, it powers on the SCLK and DIN buffers and enables the input shift register. Data is transferred in \non the falling edges of the next 24 clocks. If SYNC  is taken high  before the 24th  falling edge, the rising \nedge of SYNC  acts as an interrupt, and the write sequence is ignored by the device.  \n7 7 SCLK  Serial Clock Input. Data is clocked into the input shift register on the falling edge of the serial c lock \ninput. Data can be transferred at rates up to 50 MHz.  \n8 8 DIN  Serial Data Input. This device has a 24 -bit shift register. Data is clocked into the register on the falling \nedge of the serial clock input.  \n9 9 VDD  Power Supply Input. These device s can be operated from 2.7 V to 5.5 V, and the supply must  be \ndecoupled with a 10 µ F capacitor in parallel with a 0.1 µ F capacitor to GND.  \n10 10 VREF  Reference Voltage Input.  \nN/A1  EPAD  Exposed Pad.

A | Page 12 of 24 TERMINOLOGY  \nRelative Accuracy or Integral Nonlinearity (INL)  \nFor the DAC, relative acc uracy or integral nonlinearity is a \nmeasurement of the maximum deviation, in LSBs, from a \nstraight line passing through the endpoints of the DAC transfer \nfunction. A typical INL vs.  code plot is shown  in Figure 5. \nDifferential N onlinearity (DNL)  \nDifferential nonlinearity is the difference between the measured \nchange and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent \ncodes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB maximum ensures monotonicity. This DAC is guaranteed monoto nic by \ndesign. A typical DNL vs. code plot is shown  in Figure 6. \nZero -Scale  Error  \nZero -scale  error is a measurement of the output error when \nzero code (0x0000) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally, the output should be 0 V . Th e zero -scale  error is always positive in \nthe AD5663 because the output of the DAC cannot go below \n0 V . It is due to a combination of the offset errors in the DAC \nand the output amplifier. Zero -scale error is expressed in mV .  \nA plot of zero -scale  error vs. temperature is shown  in Figure 11. \nFull -Scale Error  \nFull-scale error is a measurement of the output error when full -\nscale code (0xFFFF) is loaded to the DAC register.  Ideally, the \noutput s hould be VDD − 1 LS B. Full- scale error is expressed in \npercent of full -scale range. A plot of full- scale error vs. tempera -\nture is shown  in Figure 10. \nGain Error  \nGain error is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the \ndeviation  in slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from ideal \nexpressed as a percent of the full -scale range.  \nZero -Scale  Error Drift  \nZero -scale  error drift  is a measurement of the change in zero -\nscale  error with a change in temperature. It is expressed in µV/°C . \nGain  Temperature Coefficient   \nGain temperature coefficient is  a measurement of the change in \ngain error with changes in temperature. It is expressed in (ppm \nof full -scale range)/°C.  \nOffset Error  \nOffset error is a measure of the difference between V\nOUT (actual ) \nand V OUT (ideal) expressed in mV in the linear region of the trans -\nfer function. Offset error is measured on the AD5663 with \nCode 512 loaded in the DAC register.  It can be negative or \npositive.  \nDC Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)  \nPSRR  indicates how the output of the DAC is affected by changes  \nin the supply voltage. PSRR is the ratio of the change in V OUT to \na change in V DD for full -scale output of the DAC. It is measured  \nin dB. V REF is held a t  2  V,  a n d  V DD is varied by ±10%.  Output Voltage Settling Time  \nOutput voltage settling time  is the amount of time it takes for \nthe output of a DAC to settle to a specified level for a 1/4  to 3/4 \nfull-scale input change and is measured from the 24th falling  \nedge of SCLK.  \nDigital -to-Analog Glitch Impulse  \nDigital -to-analog glitch impulse is the impulse injected into the \nanalog output when the input code in the DAC register changes \nstate. It is normally specified as the area of the glitch in nV -s, \nand is measur ed when the digital input code is changed by \n1 LSB at the major carry transition (0x7FFF to 0x8 000). See \nFigure 20. \nDigital Feedthrough  \nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into \nthe analog output of the DAC f rom the digital inputs of the \nDAC, but  it is measured when the DAC output is not updated.  \nIt is specified in nV -s and measured with a full -scale code change  \non the data bus, that is, from all 0s to all 1s and vice versa. \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD) \nTotal harmonic distortion  is the difference between an ideal \nsine wave and its attenuated  version using the DAC. The sine \nwave is used as the reference for the DAC, and the THD is a \nmeasurement of the harmonics present  on the DAC output.  \nIt is measured in dB.  \nNoise Spectral Density  \nNoise spectral density  is a measurement of the internally \ngenerated random noise. Random noise is characterized as a spectral density (voltage per √Hz). It is measured by loading the \nDAC to  midscale and meas uring noise at the output. It is \nmeasured in nV/√Hz. Figure 25 shows a plot of noise spectral \ndensity . \nDC Crosstalk  \nDC crosstalk is the dc change in the output level o f one DAC in \nresponse to a change in the output of another DAC. It is measured \nwith a full -scale output change on one DAC (or soft power -down \nand power -up) while monitoring another DAC kept at midscale. \nIt is expressed in μV . \nDC crosstalk due to load curre nt change is a measure of the \nimpact that a change in load current on one DAC has to another \nDAC kept at midscale. It is expr essed in μV/mA . \nDigital Crosstalk  \nDigital crosstalk  is the glitch impulse transferred to the output \nof one DAC  at midscale in resp onse to a full -scale code change \n(all 0s to all 1s and vice versa) in the input register of another \nDAC. It is measured in standalone mode and is expressed  \nin nV -s. \nData Sheet  AD5663  \n \nRev. A | Page 13 of 24 Analog Crosstalk  \nAnalog crosstalk  is the glitch impulse transferred to the output \nof one D AC due to a change in the output of another DAC. It is \nmeasured by loading one of the input registers with a full -scale \ncode change  (all 0s to all 1s and vice versa) while keeping \nLDAC  high. Then  pulse LDAC  low and monit or the output of \nthe DAC whose  digital code was not changed. The area of the \nglitch is expressed  in nV -s.  \nDAC -to-DAC Crosstalk  \nDAC -to-DAC crosstalk  is the glitch impulse transferred to the \noutput of one DAC due to a digital code change and subsequent  \noutp ut change of another DAC. This includes both digital and \nanalog crosstalk. It is measured by loading one of the DACs \nwith a full -scale code change (all 0s to all 1s and vice versa) with \nLDAC  low and monitoring the output of another DAC. T he \nenergy of the glitch is expressed in nV -s. Multiplying Bandwidth  \nThe amplifiers within the DAC have a finite bandwidth. The  \nmultiplying bandwidth is a measure of this. A sine wave on the  \nreference (with full -scale code loaded to the DAC) appears on  \nthe output. The multiplying bandwidth is the frequency at  \nwhich the output amplitude falls to 3 dB below the input.  \n \nAD5663 Data Sheet\n \nRev. A | Page 14 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nD/A SECTION \nThe AD5663 DAC is fabricated on a CMOS process. The \narchitecture consists of a string DAC followed by an output \nbuffer amplifier. Figure 28 shows a block diagram of the DAC \narchitecture. \nDAC\nREGISTERRESISTOR\nSTRINGREF (+)VDD\nGNDREF (–)VOUTOUTPUT\nAMPLIFIER(GAIN = +1)\n05855-032 \nFigure 28.

It can range from 0 to 65,535. \nRESISTOR STRING \nThe resistor string section is shown in Figure 29. It is a string of \nresistors, each of Value R. The code loaded to the DAC register \ndetermines at which node on the string the voltage is tapped off \nto be fed into the output amplifier. The voltage is tapped off by closing one of the switches connecting the string to the amplifier. \nBecause it is a string of resistors, it is guaranteed monotonic. \nR\nR\nR\nRR TO OUTPUT\nAMPLIFIER\n05855-033 \nFigure 29. Resistor String OUTPUT AMPLIFIER \nThe output buffer amplifier can generate rail-to-rail voltages on \nits output, which gives an output range of 0 V to V DD. It can drive \na load of 2 kΩ in parallel with 1000 pF to GND.  \nThe source and sink capabilities of the output amplifier can be \nseen in Figure 15. The slew rate is 1.8 V/μs with a 1/4 to 3/4 \nfull-scale settling time of 10 μs.  \nSERIAL INTERFACE \nThe AD5663 has a 3-wire serial interface ( SYNC , SCLK, and \nDIN) that is compatible with SPI, QSPI, and MICROWIRE \ninterface standards, as well as with most DSPs. See Figure 2 for \na timing diagram of a typical write sequence. \nThe write sequence begins by bringing the SYNC  line low. Data \nfrom the DIN line is clocked into the 24-bit shift register on the \nfalling edge of SCLK. The serial clock frequency can be as high \nas 50 MHz, making the AD5663 compatible with high speed \nDSPs. On the 24th falling clock edge, the last data bit is clocked in and the programmed function is executed; that is, there is a change in DAC register contents and/or a change in the mode \nof operation. At this stage, the SYNC\n line can be kept low or be \nbrought high. In either case, it must be brought high for a mini-\nmum of 15 ns before the next write sequence so that a falling edge \nof SYNC  can initiate the next write sequence. Because the SYNC  \nbuffer draws more current when V IN = 2.0 V than it does when \nVIN = 0.10 V , SYNC  should be idled low between write sequences \nfor even lower power operation. As mentioned previously, \nhowever, it must be brought high again just before the next \nwrite sequence. \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER \nThe input shift register is 24 bits wide (see Figure 30). The first \ntwo bits are don’t cares. The next three are the Command Bit C2 \nto Command Bit C0 (see Table 7), followed by the 3-bit DAC Address A2 to DAC Address A0 (see Table 8), and, finally, the \n16-bit data-word. These are transferred to the DAC register on \nthe 24th falling edge of SCLK. \nTable 7.

However, if SYNC  is brought high before the \n24th falling edge, this acts as an interrupt to the write sequence. \nThe shift register is reset and the write sequence is seen as invalid. Neither an update of the DAC register contents nor a \nchange in the operating mode occurs (see Figure 31). \nPOWER-ON RESET \nThe AD5663 family contains a power-on reset circuit that \ncontrols the output voltage during power-up. The AD5663 DAC \noutputs power up to 0 V , the AD5663BRMZ-1  powers up to \nmidscale, and the output remains there until a valid write \nsequence is made to the DAC. This is useful in applications where it is important to know the state of the output of the DAC \nwhile it is in the process of powering up. Any events on LDAC\n \nor CLR  during power-on reset are ignored. SOFTWARE RESET \nThe AD5663 contains a software reset function. Command 101 is \nreserved for the software reset function (see Table 7). The software \nreset command contains two reset modes that are software-\nprogrammable by setting Bit DB0 in the control register.  \nTable 9 shows how the state of the bit corresponds to the mode \nof operation of the device. Table 10 shows the contents of the \ninput shift register during the software reset mode of operation. \nAfter a full software reset (DB0 = 1), there must be a short time \ndelay, approximately 5 μs, to complete the reset. During the \nreset, a low pulse can be observed on the CLR  line. If the next \nSPI transaction commences before the CLR  line returns high, \nthat SPI transaction is ignored.  \nTable 9.

SYNC  Interrupt Facility \n \nAD5663  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. A | Page 16 of 24 POWER -DOWN MODES  \nThe AD5663 contains four separate modes of operation. \nCommand 100 is re served for the power -down function  \n(see Table 7). These modes are software- programmable by \nsetting Bit DB5 and Bit DB4 in the control register. Table 11 \nshows how the state of the bits corresponds to  the mode of \noperation  of the device. Any or all DACs  (DAC B and DAC A) \ncan be powered down to the selected mode by setting the \ncorresponding two bits (Bit DB1 and Bit DB0) to 1. By \nexecuting the same Command 100, any combination of DACs can be powered up by setting  Bit DB5 and Bit DB4 to normal \noperation mode. Again, to select which combination of DAC channels to power up, set th e corresponding two bits (Bit DB1 \nand Bit DB0) to 1. See Table 12 for contents of the input shift \nregister during power -down/power -up operation.  \nThe DAC output powers up to the value in the input register \nwhile \nLDAC  is low. If  LDAC  is high, the DAC ou tput powers up \nto the value held in the DAC register before power -down . \nWhen both bits are set to 0, the part works normally with its \nnormal power consumption of 500 µA at 5 V . However, for the \nthree power -down modes, the supply current falls to 480 nA at \n5 V (100 nA at 3 V). Not only does the supply current fall, but the ou tput stage is also internally switched from the output of \nthe amplifier to a resistor network of known values. This has the advantage that the output impedance of the part is known while \nthe part is in power -down mode. The outputs can either be \nconnected i nternally to GND through a 1  kΩ or 100 kΩ register  \nor left open -circuited (three -state) (see Figure 32). \nRESISTOR\nNETWORKVOUTRESISTOR\nSTRING DAC\nPOWER-DOWN\nCIRCUITRYAMPLIFIER\n05855-036 \nFigure 32. Output Stage During Power -Down  \nThe bias generator, the output amplifier, the resistor string, and \nother associated linear circuitry are shut down when power -\ndown mode is activated. However, the contents of the DAC register are unaffected when in power -down.  The time  required  to exit power -down is typically 4 µs for  \nV\nDD = 5 V and for V DD = 3 V (see Figure 19). \nTable 11.

The input registers are connected directly to the input shift register \nand the digital code is transferred to the relevant input register \non completion of a valid write sequence. The DAC registers contain the digital code used by the resisto r strings.  \nAccess to the DAC registers is controlled by the \nLDAC  pin. \nWhen the LDAC  pin is high, the DAC registers are latched and \nthe input registers can change state without affecting the \ncontents of the DAC registers . When LDAC  is brought low, \nhowever, the DAC registers become transparent and the \ncontents of the input registers are transferred to them. The \ndouble -buffered interface is useful if the user requires \nsimultaneous updating of all DAC outpu ts. The user can write \nto one of the input registers individually and then, by bringing \nLDAC  low when writing to the other DAC input register, all \noutputs  update simultaneously.  \nThese parts each contain an extra feature whereby a DAC \nregister is not updated unless its input register has been updated \nsince the last time LDAC  was brought low. Normally, when \nLDAC  is brought low, the DAC registers are filled with the \ncontents of the input registers. In the case of the AD5663, the \nDAC register updates only if the input register has changed \nsince the last time the DAC register was updated, thereby \nremoving unnecessary digital crosstalk.  \nThe outputs o f all DACs can be updated simultaneously using \nthe hardware LDAC  pin. \nTable 12. 24-Bit Input Shift Register Contents of Power -Up/Power -Down Function  \nMSB   LSB \nDB23 to \nDB22  DB21  DB20  DB19  DB18  DB17  DB16  DB15 to  \nDB6 DB5  DB4  DB3  DB2  DB1  DB0  \nx 1 0 0 x x x x PD1  PD0  x x DAC B  DAC A  \nDon’t \ncare  Command bits (C2 to C0)  Address bits (A2 to A0);  \ndon’t care  Don’t \ncare  Power -down \nmode  Don’t care  Power down/Power up \nchannel selection;  \nset bit to 1 to select  \nchannel  \nData Sheet  AD5663  \n \nRev.

When LDAC  goes \nlow, the DAC registers are updated with the contents of the \ninput register.  \nThe LDAC  register gives the user full flexibility and control over \nthe hardware LDAC  pin. This register allows the user to select \nwhich combination of channels to simultaneously update when \nthe hardware LDAC  pin is executed. Setting the LDAC  bit \nregister to 0 for a DAC channel means that the update of this \nchannel is controlled by the LDAC  pin. If this bit is set to 1, this \nchannel synchronously updates; that is, the DAC register is \nupdated after new data is r ead in, regardless of the state of the \nLDAC  pin. It effectively sees the LDAC  pin as being pulled low. \nSee Table 13 for the LDAC  register mode of operation.  This flexibility  is useful in applications where the user wants to \nsimultaneously update select channels while the rest of the \nchannels are synchronously updating  \nWriting to the DAC using Command 110 loads the 2 -bit LDAC  \nregister [DB1:DB0]. The default for each channel is 0; that is, \nthe LDAC  pin works normally. Setting the bits to 1 means the \nDAC register is updated regardless of the state of the LDAC  pin. \nSee Table 14  for contents of the input shift register during the \nLDAC  register setup command.  \nTable 13.

The ADSP-BF537  \nincorporates two dual-channel synchronous serial ports, SPORT1 \nand SPORT0, for serial and multiprocessor communications. When using SPORT0 to connect to the AD5663, the setup for the interface is as follows:  \n\uf0b7 DT0PRI drives the DIN pin of the AD5663. \n\uf0b7 TSCLK0 drives the SCLK of the device. \n\uf0b7 The SYNC\n pin is driven from TFS0. \nAD56631 ADSP-BF537 1\nSYNC TFS0\nDIN DT0PRI\nSCLK TSCLK0\n1ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.\n05855-037 \nFigure 33.

SCK of the 68HC11/68L11 \ndrives the SCLK of the AD5663, and the MOSI output drives \nthe serial data line of the DAC. \nThe SYNC  signal is derived from a port line (PC7). The setup \nconditions for correct operation of this interface are as follows:  \n\uf0b7 The 68HC11/68L11 is configured with its CPOL bit as 0.  \n\uf0b7 The 68HC11/68L11 is configured with its CPHA bit as 1.  \nWhen data is being transmitted to the DAC, the SYNC  line is \ntaken low (PC7). When the 68HC11/68L11 is configured as \npreviously described, data appearing on the MOSI output is valid on the falling edge of SCK. Serial data from the \n68HC11/68L11 is transmitted in 10-bit bytes with only eight \nfalling clock edges occurring in the transmit cycle. Data is transmitted MSB first. To load data to the AD5663, PC7 is left \nlow after the first eight bits are transferred, and a second serial write operation is performed to the DAC.

The setup for the interface is as follows:  \n\uf0b7 TxD of the 80C51/80L51 drives SCLK of the AD5663. \n\uf0b7 RxD drives the serial data line of the part.  \nThe SYNC\n signal is again derived from a bit-programmable pin \non the port.

The 80C51/80L51 \ntransmits data in 10-bit bytes only; thus only eight falling clock edges occur in the transmit cycle. To load data to the DAC, P3.3 is left low after the first eight bits are transmitted, and a second write cycle is initiated to transmit the second byte of data. P3.3 \nis taken high following the completion of this cycle. The 80C51/ \n80L51 outputs the serial data in a format that has the LSB first. The AD5663 must receive data with the MSB first.

A | Page 19 of 24 APPLICATIONS \nCHOOSING A REFERENCE FOR THE AD5663 \nTo achieve the optimum performance from the AD5663, \nthought should be given to the choice of a precision voltage \nreference. The AD5663 has only one reference input, V REF.  \nThe voltage on the reference input is used to supply the positive \ninput to the DAC. Therefore, any error in the reference is \nreflected in the DAC.  \nWhen choosing a voltage reference for high accuracy applica-\ntions, the sources of error are initial accuracy, ppm drift, long-\nterm drift, and output voltage noise. Initial accuracy on the \noutput voltage of the DAC leads to a full-scale error in the DAC. To minimize these errors, a reference with high initial accuracy is preferred. Also, choosing a reference with an output trim adjustment, such as the ADR423 , allows a system designer to \ntrim system errors out by setting a reference voltage to a voltage other than the nominal. The trim adjustment can also be used \nat temperature to trim out any error. \nLong-term drift is a measurement of how much the reference \ndrifts over time. A reference with a tight long-term drift specifi-\ncation ensures that the overall solution remains relatively stable \nduring its entire lifetime. \nThe temperature coefficient of a reference’s output voltage \naffects INL, DNL, and TUE. A reference with a tight \ntemperature coefficient specification should be chosen to reduce temperature dependence of the DAC output voltage in \nambient conditions.  \nIn high accuracy applications, which have a relatively low noise \nbudget, reference output voltage noise needs to be considered.  \nIt is important to choose a reference with as low an output noise voltage as practical for the system noise resolution required. \nPrecision voltage references, such as the ADR425 , produce low \noutput noise in the 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz range. Examples of recom-\nmended precision references for use as supplies to the AD5663 \nare shown in the Table 15. USING A REFERENCE AS A POWER SUPPLY FOR \nTHE AD5663 \nBecause the supply current required by the AD5663 is extremely \nlow, an alternative option is to use a voltage reference to supply \nthe required voltage to the part (see Figure 37). This is especially \nuseful if the power supply is quite noisy, or if the system supply \nvoltages are at some value other than 5 V or 3 V (for example, 15 V). The voltage reference outputs a steady supply voltage for the AD5663 ; see Table 15 for a suitable reference. If the low drop-\nout REF195 is used, it must supply 250 μA of current to the \nAD5663, with no load on the output of the DAC. When the DAC output is loaded, the REF195 also needs to supply the current to the load. The total current required (with a 5 kΩ \nload on the DAC output) is \n250 μA + (5 V/5 kΩ) = 1.25 mA \nThe load regulation of the REF195 is typically 2 ppm/mA, \nwhich results in a 2.5 ppm (12.5 μV) error for the 1.25 mA \ncurrent drawn from it. This corresponds to a 0.164 LSB error. \nAD5663THREE-WIRE\nSERIAL\nINTERFACESYNC\nSCLK\nDIN15V\n5V\n500µA\nVOUT = 0V TO 5VVREF VDDREF195\n05855-041 \nFigure 37.

The circuit gives an output voltage range of ±5 V .

Bipolar Operation with the AD5663 \nUSING THE AD5663 WITH \nA GALVANICALLY ISOLATED INTERFACE \nIn process control applications in industrial environments, it  \nis often necessary to use a galvanically isolated interface to protect and isolate the controlling circuitry from any hazardous \ncommon-mode voltages that can occur in the area where the DAC is functioning. iCoupler® provides isolation in excess of \n2.5 kV . The AD5663 use a 3-wire serial logic interface, so the \nADuM1300 three-channel digital isolator provides the required \nisolation (see Figure 39). The power supply to the part also needs to be isolated, which is done by using a transformer. On the DAC side of the transformer, a 5 V regulator provides the \n5 V supply required for the AD5663.  0.1µF5V\nREGULATOR\nGNDDINSYNCSCLKPOWER 10µF\nSDISCLK\nDATAAD5663\nVOUT VOBVOA\nVOCVDD\nVICVIBVIA\nADuM1300\n05855-043 \nFigure 39. AD5663  with a Galvanically Isolated Interface \nPOWER SUPPLY BYPASSING AND GROUNDING \nWhen accuracy is important in a circuit, it is helpful to carefully \nconsider the power supply and ground return layout on the \nboard. The printed circuit board containing the AD5663 should \nhave separate analog and digital sections, each having its own \narea of the board. If the AD5663 is in a system where other \ndevices require an AGND-to-DGND connection, the connection should be made at one point only. This ground point should be as close as possible to the AD5663. \nThe power supply to the AD5663 should be bypassed with 10 μF \nand 0.1 μF capacitors. The capacitors should be located as close as possible to the device, with the 0.1 μF capacitor ideally right \nup against the device. The 10 μF capacitors are of the tantalum \nbead type. It is important that the 0.1 μF capacitor have low effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESI) as in, for example, common ceramic types of capacitors. This 0.1 μF capacitor provides a low impedance path to ground \nfor high frequencies caused by transient currents due to internal \nlogic switching. \nThe power supply line itself should have as large a trace as \npossible to provide a low impedance path and to reduce glitch \neffects on the supply line. Clocks and other fast switching \ndigital signals should be shielded from other parts of the board by digital ground. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals if possible. When traces cross on opposite sides of the board, ensure that they run at right angles to each other to reduce \nfeedthrough effects through the board. The best board layout \ntechnique is the microstrip technique, where the component side of the board is dedicated to the ground plane only, and the signal traces are placed on the solder side. However, this is not \nalways possible with a 2-layer board. \n \n \nData Sheet  AD5663  \n \nRev.
