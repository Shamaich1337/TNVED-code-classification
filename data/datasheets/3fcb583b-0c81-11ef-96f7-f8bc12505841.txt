The dead-time \ncontrol comparator has a fixed offset that provides \napproximately 5% dead time. The on-chip oscillator \ncan be bypassed by terminating RT to the reference \noutput and providing a sawtooth input to CT, or it can \ndrive the common circuits in synchronous multiple-rail \npower supplies.\nThe uncommitted output transistors provide either \ncommon-emitter or emitter-follower output capability. \nThe TL494 device provides for push-pull or single-\nended output operation, which can be selected \nthrough the output-control function. The architecture \nof this device prohibits the possibility of either output \nbeing pulsed twice during push-pull operation.\nThe TL494 device is characterized for operation from \n0°C to 70°C. The TL494I device is characterized for \noperation from –40°C to 85°C.\nDevice Information(1) \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE (PIN) BODY SIZE\nTL494SOIC (16) 9.90 mm × 3.91 mm\nPDIP (16) 19.30 mm × 6.35 mm\nSOP (16) 10.30 mm × 5.30 mm\nTSSOP (16) 5.00 mm × 4.40 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\n4 Simplified Block Diagram\n13\n12\n11\n10141516\n4\n5\n6\n7321\n++\n9 8VREF\nOsc\nControlTL494TL494\nSLVS074I  – JANUARY 1983 – REVISED JULY 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The TL494 is a fixed-frequency pulse-width-modulation (PWM) control circuit. Modulation of \noutput pulses is accomplished by comparing the sawtooth waveform created by the internal oscillator on the \ntiming capacitor (CT) to either of two control signals. The output stage is enabled during the time when the \nsawtooth voltage is greater than the voltage control signals. As the control signal increases, the time during \nwhich the sawtooth input is greater decreases; therefore, the output pulse duration decreases. A pulse-steering \nflip-flop alternately directs the modulated pulse to each of the two output transistors. For more information on the \noperation of the TL494, see the application notes located on ti.com .\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\nGNDVCC\nReference\nRegulatorC1\nPulse-Steering\nFlip-FlopC11D\nDTCCTRT\nPWM\nComparator\n+\n−Error Amplifier 1≈0.1 VDead-Time Control\nComparatorOscillatorOUTPUT CTRL\n(see Function Table)\n0.7 mAE1\nC2\nE2\n+\n−Error Amplifier 21IN+\n1IN−\n2IN+\n2IN−\nFEEDBACKREF6\n5\n4\n1\n2\n16\n15\n313\n8\n9\n11\n10\n12\n14\n7Q1\nQ2≈0.7 V\n9.3 Feature Description\n9.3.1 5-V Reference Regulator\nThe TL494 internal 5-V reference regulator output is the REF pin. In addition to providing a stable reference, \nit acts as a preregulator and establishes a stable supply from which the output-control logic, pulse-steering \nflip-flop, oscillator, dead-time control comparator, and PWM comparator are powered. The regulator employs a \nband-gap circuit as its primary reference to maintain thermal stability of less than 100-mV variation over the \noperating free-air temperature range of 0°C to 70°C. Short-circuit protection is provided to protect the internal \nreference and preregulator; 10 mA of load current is available for additional bias circuits. The reference is \ninternally programmed to an initial accuracy of ±5% and maintains a stability of less than 25-mV variation over \nan input voltage range of 7 V to 40 V. For input voltages less than 7 V, the regulator saturates within 1 V of the \ninput and tracks it.\n9.3.2 Oscillator\nThe oscillator provides a positive sawtooth waveform to the dead-time and PWM comparators for comparison to \nthe various control signals.TL494\nSLVS074I – JANUARY 1983 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TL494\nThe frequency of the oscillator is programmed by selecting timing components R T and C T. The oscillator charges \nthe external timing capacitor, C T, with a constant current, the value of which is determined by the external \ntiming resistor, R T. This produces a linear-ramp voltage waveform. When the voltage across C T reaches 3 V, the \noscillator circuit discharges it, and the charging cycle is reinitiated. The charging current is determined by the \nformula:\nCHARGE\nT3 VIR/c61\n(1)\nThe period of the sawtooth waveform is:\nT\nCHARGE3 V CTI/c180/c61\n(2)\nThe frequency of the oscillator becomes:\nOSC\nT T1fR C/c61/c180\n(3)\nHowever, the oscillator frequency is equal to the output frequency only for single-ended applications. For \npush-pull applications, the output frequency is one-half the oscillator frequency.\nSingle-ended applications:\nT T1fR C/c61/c180\n(4)\nPush-pull applications:\nT T1f2R C/c61/c180\n(5)\n9.3.3 Dead-time Control\nThe dead-time control input provides control of the minimum dead time (off time). The output of the comparator \ninhibits switching transistors Q1 and Q2 when the voltage at the input is greater than the ramp voltage of the \noscillator. An internal offset of 110 mV ensures a minimum dead time of ∼3% with the dead-time control input \ngrounded. Applying a voltage to the dead-time control input can impose additional dead time. This provides a \nlinear control of the dead time from its minimum of 3% to 100% as the input voltage is varied from 0 V to 3.3 V, \nrespectively. With full-range control, the output can be controlled from external sources without disrupting the \nerror amplifiers. The dead-time control input is a relatively high-impedance input (I I < 10 μA) and should be \nused where additional control of the output duty cycle is required. However, for proper control, the input must be \nterminated. An open circuit is an undefined condition.\n9.3.4 Comparator\nThe comparator is biased from the 5-V reference regulator. This provides isolation from the input supply for \nimproved stability. The input of the comparator does not exhibit hysteresis, so protection against false triggering \nnear the threshold must be provided. The comparator has a response time of 400 ns from either of the \ncontrol-signal inputs to the output transistors, with only 100 mV of overdrive. This ensures positive control of the \noutput within one-half cycle for operation within the recommended 300-kHz range.\n9.3.5 Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)\nThe comparator also provides modulation control of the output pulse width. For this, the ramp voltage across \ntiming capacitor C T is compared to the control signal present at the output of the error amplifiers. The timing \ncapacitor input incorporates a series diode that is omitted from the control signal input. This requires the control www.ti.comTL494\nSLVS074I – JANUARY 1983 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TL494\nsignal (error amplifier output) to be ∼0.7 V greater than the voltage across C T to inhibit the output logic, and \nensures maximum duty cycle operation without requiring the control voltage to sink to a true ground potential. \nThe output pulse width varies from 97% of the period to 0 as the voltage present at the error amplifier output \nvaries from 0.5 V to 3.5 V, respectively.\n9.3.6 Error Amplifiers\nBoth high-gain error amplifiers receive their bias from the V I supply rail. This permits a common-mode input \nvoltage range from –0.3 V to 2 V less than V I. Both amplifiers behave characteristically of a single-ended \nsingle-supply amplifier, in that each output is active high only. This allows each amplifier to pull up independently \nfor a decreasing output pulse-width demand. With both outputs ORed together at the inverting input node of the \nPWM comparator, the amplifier demanding the minimum pulse out dominates. The amplifier outputs are biased \nlow by a current sink to provide maximum pulse width out when both amplifiers are biased off.\n9.3.7 Output-Control Input\nThe output-control input determines whether the output transistors operate in parallel or push-pull. This input \nis the supply source for the pulse-steering flip-flop. The output-control input is asynchronous and has direct \ncontrol over the output, independent of the oscillator or pulse-steering flip-flop. The input condition is intended \nto be a fixed condition that is defined by the application. For parallel operation, the output-control input must \nbe grounded. This disables the pulse-steering flip-flop and inhibits its outputs. In this mode, the pulses seen at \nthe output of the dead-time control/PWM comparator are transmitted by both output transistors in parallel. For \npush-pull operation, the output-control input must be connected to the internal 5-V reference regulator. Under \nthis condition, each of the output transistors is enabled, alternately, by the pulse-steering flip-flop.\n9.3.8 Output Transistors\nTwo output transistors are available on the TL494. Both transistors are configured as open collector/open \nemitter, and each is capable of sinking or sourcing up to 200 mA. The transistors have a saturation voltage of \nless than 1.3 V in the common-emitter configuration and less than 2.5 V in the emitter-follower configuration. \nThe outputs are protected against excessive power dissipation to prevent damage, but do not employ sufficient \ncurrent limiting to allow them to be operated as current-source outputs.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\nWhen the OUTPUT CTRL pin is tied to ground, the TL494 is operating in single-ended or parallel mode. When \nthe OUTPUT CTRL pin is tied to V REF, the TL494 is operating in normal push-pull operation.TL494\nSLVS074I – JANUARY 1983 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TL494\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

Error-Amplifier Section\nThe TL494 internal 5-V reference is divided to 2.5 V by R3 and R4. The output-voltage error signal also is \ndivided to 2.5 V by R8 and R9. If the output must be regulated to exactly 5.0 V, a 10-k Ω potentiometer can be \nused in place of R8 to provide an adjustment.\nTo increase the stability of the error-amplifier circuit, the output of the error amplifier is fed back to the inverting \ninput through R T, reducing the gain to 101.\n10.2.2.2.3 Current-Limiting Amplifier\nThe power supply was designed for a 10-A load current and an I L swing of 1.5 A, therefore, the short-circuit \ncurrent should be:\nL\nSC OII I 10.75 A2/c61 /c43 /c61\n(10)\nThe current-limiting circuit is shown in Figure 10-4 .\n15\n16R1\n1 N\x9f\x03R2\n4 N\x9f\x03\nLoad +TL494\n14\nVREFTL494\nR13\n0.1 \x9f\x03VO\nFigure 10-4.

The output pulse width reduces accordingly.

The availability of the dead-time control makes implementation of a \nsoft-start circuit relatively simple (see Figure 10-5 ).www.ti.comTL494\nSLVS074I – JANUARY 1983 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TL494\nTL494\nPin 4 Voltage\nPWM OutputOscillator Ramp Voltage\ntonRT C2+5 V\n0.1 VOsc\nR614\n5\n4\n7Oscillator Ramp\n+Figure 10-5. Soft-Start Circuit\nThe soft-start circuit allows the pulse width at the output to increase slowly (see Figure 10-5 ) by applying a \nnegative slope waveform to the dead-time control input (pin 4).\nInitially, capacitor C2 forces the dead-time control input to follow the 5-V regulator, which disables the outputs \n(100% dead time). As the capacitor charges through R6, the output pulse width slowly increases until the control \nloop takes command. With a resistor ratio of 1:10 for R6 and R7, the voltage at pin 4 after start-up is 0.1 × 5 V, or \n0.5 V.\nThe soft-start time generally is in the range of 25 to 100 clock cycles. If 50 clock cycles at a 20-kHz switching \nrate is selected, the soft-start time is:\n1 1t 50 sper clock cyclef 20kHz/c61 /c61 /c61 /c109\n(12)\nThe value of the capacitor then is determined by:\nsoft start time 50 s 50cyclesC2 2.5 FR6 1k/c45 /c109 /c180/c61 /c61 /c61 /c109/c87\n(13)\nThis helps eliminate any false signals that might be created by the control circuit as power is applied.TL494\nSLVS074I – JANUARY 1983 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TL494\n10.2.2.3 Inductor Calculations\nThe switching circuit used is shown in Figure 39.\nR1C1D1S1L\nVO VI\nFigure 10-6.

An electrolytic capacitor can be modeled as a series connection of an inductance, a \nresistance, and a capacitance. To provide good filtering, the ripple frequency must be far below the frequencies \nat which the series inductance becomes important. So, the two components of interest are the capacitance and \nthe effective series resistance (ESR). The maximum ESR is calculated according to the relation between the \nspecified peak-to-peak ripple voltage and the peak-to-peak ripple current.\nO(ripple)\nLV VESR(max) 0.067I 1.5 A/c68\n/c61 /c61 /c187 /c87/c68\n(14)\nThe minimum capacitance of C3 necessary to maintain the V O ripple voltage at less than the 100-mV design \nobjective is calculated according to Equation 15 :\nL\n3OI 1.5 AC3 94 F8f V 8 20 10 0.1 V/c68/c61 /c61 /c61 /c109/c68 /c180 /c180 /c180\n(15)\nA 220-mF, 60-V capacitor is selected because it has a maximum ESR of 0.074 Ω and a maximum ripple current \nof 2.8 A.\n10.2.2.5 Transistor Power-Switch Calculations\nThe transistor power switch was constructed with an NTE153 pnp drive transistor and an NTE331 npn output \ntransistor.

This input supply \nshould be well regulated. If the input supply is located more than a few inches from the device, additional bulk \ncapacitance may be required in addition to the ceramic bypass capacitors. A tantalum capacitor with a value of \n47 μF is a typical choice, however this may vary depending upon the output power being delivered.\n12 Layout\n12.1 Layout Guidelines\nAlways try to use a low EMI inductor with a ferrite type closed core. Some examples would be toroid and \nencased E core inductors. Open core can be used if they have low EMI characteristics and are located a bit \nmore away from the low power traces and components. Make the poles perpendicular to the PCB as well if using \nan open core. Stick cores usually emit the most unwanted noise.\n12.1.1 Feedback Traces\nTry to run the feedback trace as far from the inductor and noisy power traces as possible. You would also like \nthe feedback trace to be as direct as possible and somewhat thick. These two sometimes involve a trade-off, but \nkeeping it away from inductor EMI and other noise sources is the more critical of the two. Run the feedback trace \non the side of the PCB opposite of the inductor with a ground plane separating the two.\n12.1.2 Input/Output Capacitors\nWhen using a low value ceramic input filter capacitor, it should be located as close to the VCC pin of the IC as \npossible. This will eliminate as much trace inductance effects as possible and give the internal IC rail a cleaner \nvoltage supply. Some designs require the use of a feed-forward capacitor connected from the output to the \nfeedback pin as well, usually for stability reasons. In this case it should also be positioned as close to the IC as \npossible. Using surface mount capacitors also reduces lead length and lessens the chance of noise coupling into \nthe effective antenna created by through-hole components.\n12.1.3 Compensation Components\nExternal compensation components for stability should also be placed close to the IC. Surface mount \ncomponents are recommended here as well for the same reasons discussed for the filter capacitors. These \nshould not be located very close to the inductor either.\n12.1.4 Traces and Ground Planes\n•Make all of the power (high current) traces as short, direct, and thick as possible. It is good practice on a \nstandard PCB board to make the traces an absolute minimum of 15 mils (0.381 mm) per Ampere.\n•The inductor, output capacitors, and output diode should be as close to each other possible. This helps \nreduce the EMI radiated by the power traces due to the high switching currents through them. This will also \nreduce lead inductance and resistance as well, which in turn reduces noise spikes, ringing, and resistive \nlosses that produce voltage errors.\n•The grounds of the IC, input capacitors, output capacitors, and output diode (if applicable) should be \nconnected close together directly to a ground plane. It would also be a good idea to have a ground plane on \nboth sides of the PCB. This will reduce noise as well by reducing ground loop errors as well as by absorbing \nmore of the EMI radiated by the inductor.\n•For multi-layer boards with more than two layers, a ground plane can be used to separate the power plane \n(where the power traces and components are) and the signal plane (where the feedback and compensation \nand components are) for improved performance.\n•On multi-layer boards the use of vias will be required to connect traces and different planes.\n•It is good practice to use one standard via per 200 mA of current if the trace will need to conduct a significant \namount of current from one plane to the other.\n•Arrange the components so that the switching current loops curl in the same direction. Due to the way \nswitching regulators operate, there are two power states. One state when the switch is on and one when the \nswitch is off. During each state there will be a current loop made by the power components that are currently \nconducting. Place the power components so that during each of the two states the current loop is conducting TL494\nSLVS074I – JANUARY 1983 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TL494\nin the same direction. This prevents magnetic field reversal caused by the traces between the two half-cycles \nand reduces radiated EMI.\n12.2 Layout Example\nGNDTL4942 1IN ±\n3\n4 DTC\nCT\nRT\n7 GND\n8 9 E110 E211 C212 VCC1314 REF15 2IN±16 2IN+\nFEEDBACK1IN+\nC1OUTPUT\nCTRL1VIA to Power PlanePower or GND Plane\nVIA to GND PlaneLEGEND\n65\nOutputVCC\nFigure 12-1.
