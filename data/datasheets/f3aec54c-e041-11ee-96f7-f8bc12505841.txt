All Rights Reserved.  \nApplication Information  \nLike any low -dropout regulator, the external c apacitors used with the EA9104 must be carefully \nselected for regulator stability and performance.  Using a capacitor whose value is > 1uF on the \nEA9104 input and the amount of capacitance can be increased without limit.  The input capacitor \nmust be locate d a distance that less than 0.5 inch from the input pin of the device to a clean analog \nground.   Any good quality ceramic or tantalum can be used for this capacitor.  The capacitor with \nlarger value and lower ESR (equivalent series resistance) provides bet ter PSRR and line transient \nresponse.  The output capacitor must meet both requirements for minimum amount of capacitance \nand ESR in all LDOs application .  The EA9104 is designed specifically to work with low ESR \nceramic output capacitor in space -saving an d performance consideration.  Using a ceramic \ncapacitor whose value is at least 1uF with ESR is > 25m Ω on the EA9104 output ensures stability.  \nThe EA9104 still works well with output capacitor of other types due to the wide stable ESR range.  \nOutput capacitor of larger capacitance can reduce noise and improve load transient response, \nstability and PSRR.  The EA9104 features an LDO regulator enable/disable function.  To assure \nthe LDO regulator will switch on, the EN turn on control level must be greater than 1.2V.  The LDO \nregulator will go into the shutdown mode when the voltage on the EN pin falls below  0.4V.  The \nEA9104 have a quick -discharge funct ion to protecting the system.  If the enable function is not \nneeded in a specific application, it may be tied to VIN to keep the LDO regulator in a continuously \non state.  \n \nThermal Considerations  \nThermal protection limits power dissipation in EA9104.  When  the operation junction temperature \nexceeds 165 °C, the OTP circuit starts the thermal shutdown function turn the pass element off.   \nThe pass element turn on again after the junction temperature cools by 30 °C.  For continue \noperation, do not exceed absolute  maximum operation junction temperature 125 °C.  The \nmaximum power dissipation depends on the thermal resistance of IC package, PCB layout, the rate \nof surroundings airflow and temperature difference between junction to ambient.  The maximum \npower dissipation can be calculated by following formula:  \nPD(MAX)  = ( T J(MAX)  - TA ) / θJA \nWhere T J(MAX)  is the maximum operation junction temperature 125 °C, TA is the ambient temperature \nand the θJA is the junction to ambient thermal resistance.  For recommended op erating conditions \nspecification of EA9104, the T J(MAX)  is the maximum junction temperature of the die (125 °C) and T A \nis the maximum ambient temperature.  The junction to ambient thermal resistance θJA for SOT23 -5 \npackage  is 250°C/W. \n \n9 Datasheet  EA9104  \n300mA, Ultra -low noise, Ultra -Fast CMOS LDO  \nVer. 1.2 Copyright © 2017 Everanalog  Integrated Circuit Limited.
