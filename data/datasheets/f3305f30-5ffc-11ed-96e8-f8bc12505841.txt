Set the l ock detect threshold s (PLL1 Lock Detect Timer[4:0]  in Register 0x0028) appropriately  in the SPI.   \n6 Depends on initial phase offset (worst case is proportional to N1) and VCXO excess tuning range available over the target (f DELTA_VCXO ). For PFD rates typical of PLL1, \ncycle slipping is normally i nsignificant.  \n7 tLCM is the least common multiple (LCM) of PLL1 clock input frequencies. The specification is given in multiples of t LCM.  \n8 If LOS triggers before t he PFD edge is normally detected  (more likely with high R1 values), the charge pump is more likely to disable before the next invalid \ncomparison occurs. Otherwise, the fast tristate circuit disables the charge pump after about 4 ns (8 ns worst case) of pha se error.  \n9 tLOSVAL  is a register value that is programmable from 1, 2, 4, …,  64 tLCM. \n10 If the hold off timer is used, the finite state machine ( FSM ) stays in holdover after LOS of the active reference before switching clocks, giving the original clock a chance \nto return.  \n11 tVCXO is the  VCXO clock period.  \n12 See the PLL1 Holdover Exit  section.  \n13 The time required for the phases to intersect is inversely proportional to the holdover frequency error. Note that the f requency  error during holdover is expected to \nbe much smaller than is available from the tuning range  of the VCXO.  \n14 fERR_VCXO  is the error frequency of the VCXO.  \n \nPLL2 CHARACTERISTICS  \nTable 5. \nParameter  Min  Typ  Max  Unit  Test Conditions/Co mments  \nPLL2 VCXO INPUT       \nRecommended Swing       \nDifferential  0.2  1.4 V p-p Differential, keep signal at OSCIN and OSCIN  pins < 2.8 V  \nSingle -Ended (<250  MHz)1 0.2  1.4 V p-p Keep signal at OSCIN and OSCIN  pins < 2.8 V  \nCommon -Mode Range  1.6 2.1 2.4 V If user supplied, on -chip V CM is approximately 2.1  V \nVCXO Input Slew Rate  300     mV/ns  Slew rates as low as 100 mV/ns are functional, but can \ndegrade the phase noise plateau by about 3 dB  \nInput Capacitance   1.5  pF Per side; 3 pF differential  \nDifferential Input Resistance   100 to 1000   Ω User selectable  \nReturn Loss   −12  dB When terminated with 100 Ω  differential  \nPLL2 EXTERNAL VCO INPUT       \nRecommended Input \nPower, AC -Coupled       \nDifferential  −6   6 dBm   \nSingle -Ended1 −6   6 dBm   \nReturn Loss   −12   dB When terminated with 100 Ω  differential  \nExternal VCO Frequency1 400   3200 MHz  Fundamental mode; if < 1 GHz, set the low frequency \nexternal VCO path bit (Register 0x0064, Bit 0)  \n 400  6000 MHz  Using external VCO ÷ 2  \nCommon -Mode Range1 1.6 2.1 2.2 V  \nPLL2 DIVIDERS       \n12-Bit Reference Divider \nRange (R2)  1   4095   \n16-Bit Feedback Divider \nRange (N2) 8   65,535    \nPLL2 FREQUENCY LIMITAT IONS       \nVCXO Frequency (f VCXO) 10   500 MHz  122.88 MHz or 155 MHz are typical  \nVCXO Duty Cycle       \nUsing Doubler1 40   60 % Distortion can lead to a spur at f PD/2 offset, note that \nminimum pulse width >  3 ns  \nHMC7044  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Their presence causes a de cibel for decibel influence. F or example, if the third  harmonic is at − 10 dBc, there is  an additional noise contributor  of 10 dB \nlower than the fundamental at all  offsets that folds in -band and causes a 0.2  dB hit overall. The influence of the harmonics factoring into the degradation is primarily a \nfunction of the frequency of the buffer bandwidth relative to the third , fifth, and se venth harmonics. As the output frequency reduces, more harmonics fall into the observation  \nbandwidth, and the degradation worsens, but only slightly. This effect produces a penalty of 0.65 dB maximum  if harmonics u p to the 61st harmonic  is included . \n4 See the Phase Noise Floor and Jitter  section for more information on how to calculate the phase noise floor.  \n5 See the Phase Noise Floor and Jitter  section for more information on how to calculate  the j itter density of floor . \n6 See the Phase Noise Floor and Jitter  section for more information on how to calculate the  rms additive jitter due to floor.  \nCLOCK OUTPUT DRIVER CHARACTERISTICS  \nTable 10. \nParameter  Min  Typ  Max  Unit  Test Conditions/Comments  \nCML MODE (LOW POWER)      RL = 100 Ω , 9.6 mA  \n−3 dB Bandwidth   1950  MHz  Differential output voltage = 980 mV p -p diff  \nOutput Rise Time  175  ps fCLKOUT  = 245.76 MHz, 20% to 80%  \n 145  ps fCLKOUT  = 983.04 MHz, 20% to 80%  \nOutput Fall Time   185  ps fCLKOUT  = 245.76 MHz, 20% to 80%  \n 145  ps fCLKOUT  = 983.04 MHz, 20% to 80%  \nOutput Duty Cycle1 47.5  50 52.5  % fCLKOUT  = 1075 MHz (2150 MHz/2)  \nDifferential Output Voltage Magnitude   1390  mV p -p diff  fCLKOUT  = 245.76 MHz (2949.12 MHz/12)  \n  1360   mV p -p diff  fCLKOUT  = 983.04 MHz (2949.12  MHz/3)  \nCommon -Mode Output Voltage   VCC − 1.05   V fCLKOUT  = 245.76 MHz (2949.12 MHz/12)  \nHMC7044  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 22 of 71 TERMINOLOGY  \nPhase Jitter  \nAn ideal sine wave can be thought of as having a continuous \nand even progression of phase with time from 0° to 360° for \neach cycle. Actual signals, however, display a certain amount \nof variation from ideal phase progression over time. This \npheno menon is phase jitter. Although many causes can \ncontribute to phase jitter, one major cause is random noise, \nwhich is characterized statistically as being Gaussian (normal) \nin distrib ution.  \nThis phase jitter leads to the energy of the sine wave in the frequency domain spreading out, producing a continuous \npower spectrum. This power spectrum is usually reported as \na series of values whose units are dBc/Hz at a given offset in \nfrequency from the sine wave (carrier). The value is a ratio \n(expressed in decibels ) of the power contained within a 1 Hz \nbandwidth with respect to the power at the carrier frequency. \nFor each measurement, the offset from the carrier frequency is \nalso given.   \nPhase Noise  \nIt is meaningful to integrate the total power contained within some interval of offset frequencies (for example, 10 kHz to \n10 MHz). This is the integrated phase noise over that frequency \noffset interval and can be readily related to the time jitter due to \nthe phase noise within that offset frequency interval.  \nPhase noise  has a detrimental effect on the performance of ADCs , \nDACs, and RF mixers. It lowers the achievable dynamic range \nof the converters and mixers, although they are affected in \nsomewhat different ways.  \nTime Jitter  \nPhase noise is a frequency domain phenomenon.  In the time \ndomain, the same effect is exhibited as time jitter. When observing  \na sine wave, the time of successive zero crossings varies. In a square  wave, the time jitter is a displacement of the edges from their \nideal (regular) times of occurrence. In both cases, the variations in \ntiming from the ideal are the time jitter. Because these variations  \nare random in nature, the time jitter is specified in  seconds root \nmean square (rms) or 1 sigma of the Gaussian distribution.  \nTime jitter that occurs on a sam pling clock for a DAC or an \nADC decreases the signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) and dynamic \nrange of the converter. A sampling clock with the lowest possible  \njitter provides the highest performance from a given converter.  \nAdditive Phase Noise  \nAdditive phase nois e is the amount of phase noise that is \nattributable to the device or subsystem being measured. \nThe phase noise of any external oscillators or clock sou rces is \nsubtracted, which makes it possible to predict the degree to \nwhich the device impacts the total system phase noise when \nused in conjunction with the various oscillators and clock \nsources, each of which contributes its own phase noise to the \ntotal. In many cases, the phase noise of one element dominates \nthe system phase noise. When there are multiple c ontributors \nto phase noise, the total is the square root of the sum of squares \nof the individual contributors.  \nAdditive Time Jitter  \nAdditive time jitte r is the amount of time jitter that is attributable  \nto the device or subsystem being measured. The time j itter of \nany external oscillators or clock sources is subtracted, which \nmakes it  possible to predict the degree to which the device \nimpacts the total system time jitter when used in conjunction with \nthe various  oscillators and clock sources, each of which contributes  \nits own time jitter to the total. In many cases, the time jitter of the \nexternal  oscillators and clock sources dominates the system \ntime ji tter. \n \nData Sheet  HMC7044  \n \nRev. C | Page 23 of 71 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe HMC7044 is a high performance, dual -loop, integer N \njitter attenuator capable of performing frequency translation, \nreference selection, and generation of ultralow phase noise \nreferences for high sp eed data converters with either parallel or \nserial (JESD204B type) interfaces. The device is designed to \nmeet the requirements of demanding base station designs and  \noffers a wide range of  clock management and distribution \nfeatures to simplify baseband and  radio card clock tree designs.  \nThe HMC7044 uses a dual -loop architecture, where two integer \nmode PLLs are connected in series to form a jitter attenuating clock multiplier unit. The high performance dual -loop topology \nof the HMC7044 enables the wireless/RF system designer to \nattenuate the incoming jitter of a primary system reference \nclock (for example, Common Public Radio  Interface™ (CPRI) \nsource) and generate low phase noise, high freq uency clocks to \ndrive data converter sample clock inputs. The HMC7044  provides \n14 low noise and configurable outputs to of fer flexibility in  \ninterfacing with many  different components in a n RF trans -\nceiver system, such as data converters, local oscillators,  \ntransmit/receive modules, FPGAs , and digital front -end (DFE) \nASICs.  \nThe first PLL in the HMC7044 is designed for low bandwidth \nconfiguration using appropriately selected external loop filter components, and internal charge pump bias settings to achieve  \nless than a few hundred Hz bandwidth, typically. The ex act \nbandwidth roll -off points depend on the frequency spectrum of \nnoise that must be attenuated in the system. The first PLL locks \nan external VCXO and provides the clock holdover functions \nand the re ference frequency to the high performance second \nPLL loo p. The combination of the loops provides an excellent \nclock generation unit with the capability to attenuate incoming \nreference clock jitter. The second PLL loop features two \noverlapping on -chip VCOs that are SPI selectable with center \nfrequencies at 2.5 G Hz and 3 GHz, respectively. Both VCOs are \ndesigned to have wide tuning ranges for broad output frequency  \ncoverage. The desired output frequency is set by the chosen \nVCXO frequency, VCO core (higher or  lower frequency core), \nand the programmed second PLL fe edback divider and output \nchannel divider values.  \nThe HMC7044 generates  up to seven  DCLK  and SYSREF clock \npairs  per the JESD204B interface requirements. The system \ndesigner can generate a lower number of DCLK and SYSREF \npairs, and configure the remai ning output signal paths as \ndesired, either as DCLKs or additional SYSREFs or other \nreference clocks with independent phase and frequency  \nadjustment . Frequency adjustment can be accomplished by \nselecting the appropriate output divider values . One of the \nunique features of the HMC7044  is the independent flexible \nphase management of each of the 14 channels. Using a \ncombination of d ivider slip -based, digital/coarse and \nanalog/fine delay adjustments, each channel  can be programmed to have a different phase offset. The phase \nadjustment capability allows the designer to offset board flight \ntime delay variations, data converter sample wi ndow matching, \nand meet JESD204B synchronization challenges.  The output \nsignal path design of the HMC7044 is implemented to ensu re \nboth linear phase adjustment steps and minimal noise perturbation  \nwhen phase adjustment circuits are turned on.  \nOne of the key challenges in JESD204B system design is ensuring  \nthe synchronization of data converter frame alignment across \nthe system, from  the FPGA or DFE to ADCs and DACs \nthrough a large clock tree  that can comprise multiple clock \ngeneration and distribution ICs. The HMC7044  is specifically \ndesigned to offer features to address this challenge. Using the \nSYSREF valid interrupt featur e, the wait time latency can be \nreduced in the FPGAs. The HMC7044 raises this flag through \nits GPO port when all counters are set and outputs are at the \ndesired phases. Additionally, an ex ternal reference- based \nsynchronization feature (SYNC via PLL2 or RF SYNC o nly in \nfanout mode) synchronizes multiple devices, that is, it ensures that all clock outputs start with same rising edge. This operation  is \nachieved by rephasing the SYSREF control unit deterministi -\ncally, and then restarting the output dividers with this  new \ndesired phase.  \nOffering excellent crosstalk, frequency isolation, and spurious \nperformance, the device generates independent frequencies in \nboth single -ended and differential f ormats. The four input \nreference options allows up to three backup frequen cy sources, \nwith hitless switching and holdover capabilities, supporting system redundancy and uninterrupted operation on reference \ndata and clock failures. The device also features dedicated oscillator  \nfanout mode for best clock isolation, which generates  multiple \ncopies of the VCXO clock to be distributed across the board \nwith excellent frequency isolation.  \nBoth  the DCLK  and SYSREF clock outputs can  be configured \nto support differen t signaling standards , including CML, LVDS,  \nLVPECL , and LVCMOS , and differ ent bias conditions to offset \nvarying board insertion losses. The outputs can  also be \nprogrammed for ac or dc  coupling and 50  Ω or 100  Ω internal \nand external termination options.  \nThe HMC7044 is programmed via a 3- wire serial port interface \n(SPI) and powers up with a default configuration that generates \nvalid output frequencies within the VCO tuning ranges regardless \nof whether a reference clock exists.  \nThe HMC7044 is offered in a 68 -lead, 10 mm ×10 mm, \nLFCSP _VQ  with the exposed pad to ground.  \nNote that, throughout this data sheet, multifunction p ins, such \nas CLKIN0/RFSYNCIN, are referred to either by the entire pin name or by a single function of the pin, for example, CLKIN0, \nwhen only that function is relevant.  \nData Sheet  HMC7044  \n \nRev.

Top Level Diagram  \n \nData Sheet  HMC7044  \n \nRev. C | Page 25 of 71 DUAL PLL OVERVIEW  \nThe HMC7044 uses a cascade of two PLLs, referred to as a dual \nloop topology. The term dual loop sometimes ref ers to other \narchitectures as well; therefore, always refer to the block diagram  \nshown in Figure  35 to remove any ambiguity. In this architecture, \nthe first PLL (PLL1) normally operates as a jitter attenuator. PLL1  \nlocks a clean local VCXO to a relatively noisy reference using a \nvery narrow loop band width. The loop bandwidth preserves the \naverage frequency of the reference signal (which is normally \ncorrect),  while rejecting most of  its noise. The second PLL takes \nthis low noise VCXO and multiplies it up to the VCO frequency (in the 2 GHz to 3  GHz range) with very little additive  noise. The \narchitecture provides the benefits of an output frequency locked to \nan input reference signal, while being insensitive to  its noise \nprofile.  \nIn ICs such as the HMC7044, the VCO is then connected to an array of output channels, each with an optional RF divider and \nphase control. The key feature that distingui shes an IC with \nJESD204B support is the ability to ensure that all outputs with \ntheir associated dividers have a user defined phase relationship  \nevery time, regardless of process, voltage, or temperature . This \nability is necessary to suppor t the JESD204B SERDES sta ndard  \nfor data converters, but it is also an immensely useful feature in \nother applications as well, in all forms of arrayed systems  and in \nmany test and measurement scenarios.  \nCOMPONENT BLOCKS —INPUT PLL (PLL1)  \nPLL1 General Descrip tion (Jitter Attenuator)  \nA variety of local clocks, particularly in synchronous networks, \nderive their timing from a remote node in the network. These \nreference signals can  arrive via a GPS or clock data recovery \n(CDR) receiver, or from a variety of other sources. Often, these \nderived references are relatively poor quality, in terms of spurious  \ncontent, noise, and reliability.  \nThe function of PLL1 is to lock a clean VCXO to the average \nfrequency of one of these references and feed it to PLL2 to \ngenerate a h igh quality clock for loc al use.  In addition, PLL1 monitors its active reference for failure and smoothly takes appropriate action, switching to a redundant \nreference or going into holdover as appropriate. Figure 36 \nshows the architecture of PLL1 with a typical frequency \nconfiguration.  \nJitter Attenuation  \nFor jitter attenuation, PLL1 consists of all the usual \ncomponents in a PLL: a phase/frequency detector (PFD1),  \ncharge pump (CP1), reference divider (R1), and feedback \ndivider (N1). The loop filter is external to provide maximum \nflexibility, and the loop bandwidth (BW) is normally \nconfigured very narrow (20 Hz to 500 Hz) to filter any jitter and spurious tones comi ng in from relatively poor references.  \nThe noise profile of PLL1 is typically dependent on the loop bandwidth, input reference noise, and the VCXO characteristic. \nThe inherent noise sources of PLL1 (the PFD, dividers, and \ncharge pump) are not normally obse rvable in an application \nand are sign ificantly more relaxed compared with PLL2.  \nNote that the loop filter components on the board are typically configured to produce a certain loop bandwidth, given a fixed \nPFD rate, charge pump current, and VCXO character istic. \nAdjusting any of these paramete rs from their nominal positions \naffects the loop dynamics, which can be to the advantage of the user (for example, to scale loop BW with charge pump current), \nbut it must not be performed without an analysis of the sta bility \nof the loop. Analog Devices, In c., provides a variety of software \ntools to design the loop filter and model the effects of any change in parameters. Contact Analog Devices for the latest \nrecommendation.  \nThe lock time of PLL1 typically takes the long est duration in \nthe clock network, and , aside from any nonlinear slewing, takes \napproximately 5/PLL1_BW (for example, 5 ms for a 1 kHz loop \nBW). Fortunately, there are no requirements that PLL1 must be \nlocked before proceeding with PLL2, output calibration , and \nphasing, which normally allows s ystem configuration to \ncontinue in parallel while PLL1 is settling.  \n \nHMC7044  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

PLL1 Architecture with a Typical Frequency Configuration  \nLock Detect  \nThe lock detect circuit in both PLL1 and PLL2 function the \nsame way. They coun t the number of consecutive clock cycles \nin which the phase error at the PFD is below a threshold. Any  \nphase error above this threshold resets the counter, and the count is restarted. When the count reaches its programmed \nlimit, the lock detect signal is i ssued and the clock of the \ncounter is gated off to reduce power/coupling until a large \nphase error restarts the process.  \nAlthough the PLL2 loop BW is relatively well defined, the PLL1 \nloop BW can vary widely in any given application. The SPI  word, \nPLL1 Loc k Detect Timer[4:0] in Register 0x0028, configures the \nPLL1 lock detect timer and looks for 2\nPLL1 Lock Detect Timer[4:0] \nconsecutive LCM cl ock cycles with a phase -error <~4 ns to \nissue the lock detect. Because the loop BW of PLL1 can vary \ndrastically depen ding on the application, the user must set up \nthe threshold such that 2PLL1 Lock Detect Timer[4:0] LCM periods is on \nthe order of 2× to 4× the loop time constant. For example, for f\nLCM = 61.44 MHz, and a loop BW of 200 Hz, set PLL1 Lock Detect \nTimer[4:0] =  19 or 20. If the value is set much higher, the lock \ndetect circuit takes an unnecessary length of time to indicate lock after the phases stabilize. If the value is set much lower (for \nexample, much less than a loop time constant), it can  improperly  \nindica te lock during acquisition, which can cause the PLL1 \nfinite state machine (FSM) to improperly fall in and out of \nholdover mode.  \nHoldover/Reference Switching Overview  \nWhen switching between redundant references, or when all references are gone and the PLL1  is left open loop, there are \noften requirements to prevent frequency deviations that can  \ncause downstream circuits and traffic links to overrun FIFOs and/or lose lock themselves.  \n \n \n PLL1 can operate in manual or automode  (via the automode \nreference switch ing bit). In manual mode, the user selects the \nactive reference using Manual Mode Reference Switching[1:0] \nin Register 0x0029 and determines whether to go into holdover \n(via the force holdover bit). In automode, the PLL1 FSM uses \nthe loss of signal (LOS) i nformation, phase error data, lock \ndetect, and configuration data from the SPI to determine how \nto handle reference interruptions. In either mode, all status \nindicators are  available, but PLL1 only takes evasive action in \nautomode. Figure 37 shows a simplified state diagram of the \nPLL1 FSM.  \nDuring reset, PLL1 is held in the initialization (INIT) state. When  \nreset is deasserted, during the preload state, the enabled reference \npaths, the reference priority table, and LOS indicators are \nexamined  to select the best reference, and, on the next cycle, it \nattempts to lock. After the requisite number of counts has \nelapsed with low phase error, lock detect is asse rted and PLL1 \ntransitions to the locked state. When PLL1 is loc ked, a loss of lock, \nLOS on the ac tive reference, or a reference switch event initiated \nby a priority clash transitions the FSM to enter holdover, where it \ntristates the CP and potentially forc es V\nTUNE with the holdover \nDAC. When a stable clock is availabl e and other optional \nconditions are met, the FSM exits holdover. Exiting holdover is \nhandled in one of a few different  ways, designed to minimize \nphase/frequency hits during the transition. Figure 37 shows a \nsimpli fication of the PLL1 FSM. In the actual  implementa tion, \nthe holdover state is broken into a number of subsections \ncorresponding to holdover entry, stable holdover conditions, \nand holdover exit. The state of the PLL1 FSM is always available for a read via t he SPI (PLL1 FSM State[2:0]  bits in \nRegister  0x0082).  \nData Sheet  HMC7044  \nRev.

PLL1 FSM Simplified State Diagram — \nAutorevertive  Reference Switching  = 1 \nPLL1 Reference Inputs  \nPLL1 accepts up to four candidate references on  \nCLKIN3/ CLKIN3  to CLKIN0/ CLKIN0 . If all references appear \nvalid, according to the LOS, PLL1 uses a refer ence priority table \nto select the best candidate. Using the PLL1 reference priority \ncontrol bits,  program the highest priority clock (CLKI N0/CLKIN0\n, CLKIN1/ CLKIN2 , CLKIN2/ CLKIN2 , or CLKIN3/ CLKIN3 ), \nand then second priority clock, and so on. It is not necessary to \ninclude unused reference inputs in the reference priority table. \nInstead, specify the same useful clock in multiple positions. In \nautomode, reference switching occurs in the pr eload state (see \nFigure 37) as PLL1 exits reset, or while PLL1 is in the holdover \nstate.  \nThe ref erence clock input pins (Pin 36, Pin 37, Pin 39, Pin 4 0, \nPin 42, and Pin 43) have dual functions; therefore, SPI  configura -\ntion is important for proper functionality. See the PLL1 Programming Considerations  section  for more information \nabout the relevant control bits, and the Reference Buffer Details  \nsection for interface recommendations.  \nWhen a r eference fails, the s ourcing circuit recognizes a f ault \nand disables either the clock or t he buffer driving the signal t o \nthe HMC7044. For this reason, hysteresis in the input buffers \nprevents i nternal to gglin g for s ignal s wings <~75 mV p- p \ndifferential, which a llows f urther el ement s in t he PLL1 architecture \nto cleanly r ecognize the interruption a nd p revent u nwanted \ntransients in t he frequency. PLL1 LOS Detection  \nThe HMC7044 checks the validity of a reference by co mparing \nits approximate frequency vs. the VCXO . The HMC7044  suppo rts \nreferences at diffe rent frequencie s. The first step is to  divide the \navailable references and the VCXO t o the lowest common multiple \nfrequency (f LCM). These divider settings are available via the SPI \ncontrol bits (CLKINx/ CLKINx  Input Prescaler[7:0] and OSCIN/  \nOSCIN  Input Presc aler[7:0]). In the example shown in Figure 36, \nfLCM = 61.44 MHz. The VCXO derived clock at f LCM is the main \nclock to the PLL1 FSM controlling the FSM, lock detect timer, \nand ADC/DAC filtering and h oldover circuits.  Although not \nrequired, using the VCXO clock allows the LOS detection and \nPLL1 FSM to operate at a higher rate than the PFD, allowing it to \nrecognize a reference failure early and enter holdover, sometimes \nbefore a failing reference that has started to drift in either phase or frequency (or both) can influence the PFD or CP.  \nThe dividers in the LOS block, and to some extent, R1, pose a few challenges. The input frequencies are up to 800 MHz, with \na wide divider range. Furthermore, they are designed to toler ate \nglitchy clocks without catastrophic results, because a reset \nphase is not always available after an issue is detected.  \nWhen all the references are divided to the same frequency, they \nare compared relative to the VCXO d erived path, and thus each \nother.  This comparison is performed by a circuit that looks for \nthree edges of a clock within one period of the other. If it appears that a reference signal is too slow, its LOS flag is asserted and, in \nautomode, PLL1 uses this i nformation to disqualify and/or \nabandon a reference. Conversely, if it appears that the VCXO is \ntoo slow according to any of the active references, a warning is generated (available as one of the configurable options for the GPO, or readable on the SPI) bu t no automated action occurs.  \nThe HMC7044 monitors reference signals for three edges of a \nclock  within one period of the other,  instead of the more intuitive  \ntwo edges, to avoid false LOS flags as clocks that are slightly  out \nof frequency cross each other in phase in the presence of \ninterference, noise, and circuit offsets. The result is that the LOS \ntriggers when the failing refer ence clock frequency is \napproxi mately an octave from the intended frequency.  \nAfter a reference signal returns and its frequency is within an  \noctave of the VCXO, two to three cycles of the LOS validation timer must expire before the LOS flag is deasserted and the \nreference is considered for potential use. The LOS validation \ntimer is programmable between 0 LCM cycles (no hysteresis), and 64 LCM cycles via LOS Validation Timer[2:0] in Register  0x0015, Bits[2:0].  \nHMC7044  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 28 of 71 PLL1 Holdover Entry Shortcut  \nWhen a reference fails, the LOS circuit takes a number of LCM \nclock cycles to recognize the problem and to request the PLL1 \nFSM enter holdover and tristate the CP. By that time, if one of \nthe missing edges is needed to trigger the R divider output, the \nPFD  and CP have already saturated, pulling current out of the \nloop filter for these cycles, and disturbing the hol dover frequency. \nThe probability of this happening decreases as the PFD rate \ndecreases relative to f LCM, but it is not eliminated. The HMC7044 \nincludes a unique feature to prevent this type of frequency \nrunaway.  \nA sensor watches the up/down pulses from the PFD (see Figure  35). When locked, the pulse width is small, based on any \nsmall sig nal error, PFD/CP offset, and the reset delay of the PFD. If \nthe device is in the lo cked state and has a phase error that is larger  \nthan expected (~4 ns), it is a sign that the reference has failed, and \nthe device immediately tristates the pump, reducing t he \namount of time charge can be extracted from the loop from about five LCM cycles ( 162 ns at 30.72 MHz) to <4 ns. This error \nindication  also invalidates the lock detect. When the FSM \nacknowledges the issue, it holds the CP in tristate. When using \nthe opti onal DAC -based holdover, the FSM instructs the \nADC/DAC that is tracking the V\nTUNE voltage to switch from \nsense mode to force mode, holding it steady to within 1  LSB \n(about 20 mV or 0.4 ppm)  until the HMC7044 senses a stable \nreference and transitions out of holdover.  \nPLL1 Holdover Steady State  \nWhen in the holdover state, the user has the following two \noptions:  \n• Tristate the CP  \n• Tristate the CP and engage the holdover DAC  \nWhen in tristate mode,  the HMC7044 has a very high \nimpedance charge pump output (~10 GΩ). This output is \nnormally an insignificant contributor to PLL1 V TUNE leakage, \nwhich is determined primarily by the on -boar d loop filter \ncomponents and the VCXO tuning port. This mode allows the \ntuning voltage to maintain itself for significant periods while in holdover.  \nTo accommodate indefinite periods in holdover, or to ensure \nV\nTUNE is driven and not susceptible to drift, t he second option \n(set via the holdover uses DAC bit in Register 0x0029, Bit 2) \nforces the V TUNE voltage to its time averaged value, obtained by \nlow-pass filtering the ADC value while the PLL is reporting \nlock. The h oldover sensing ADC and the driving DAC a re \nseven bits each and  have an LSB of approximately 19 mV.  \nPLL1 Holdover Exit  \nThe transition out of holdover can happen in three ways and \nis controlled by the Holdover Exit Criteria[1:0] bits and the  \nHoldover Exit Action[1:0] bits in Register 0x0016 (see the Control \nRegister Map Bit Descriptions  section for details), which \ndescribes the steps that the FSM takes as the HMC7044  exits \nholdover and acq uires lock.  The recommended methods are as follows:  \n• Wait for zero phase error (no divider reset): wait for LOS = \n0 and low phase error at PFD (Holdover Exit Criteria[1:0] = 1, \nHoldover Exit Action[1:0] = 1)  \n• Resetting the dividers: wait for LOS = 0 and rese t the \nR1/N2 dividers (Holdover Exit Criteria[1:0] = 0, Holdover Exit Action[1:0] = 0)  \n• DAC assisted release: wait for LOS = 0, reset R1/N2, and \nconfigure for DAC assisted release (Holdover Exit Criteria[1:0] = 0, Holdover Exit Action[1:0] = 3)  \nWait for Zero  Phase Error  \nWhile the CP is still in tristate, the FSM monitors the PDF for a \ncycle slip  indication as the candidate reference and VCXO signal \ncross each other. The crossing of the reference and VCXO phases \neventually occurs but can  take a long time, as  determined by the \ninherent frequency error due to an imperfect holdover. Just after a \ncycle slip event, the phase error at the PFD is at its minimum \nvalue, and there is minimal glitch as the PLL reacquires. Figure 38 \nshows an example where the reference is removed and PLL1 \ngoes into tristate -based holdover. After approximately 7 sec, the \nreference is restored and, about a second later, the phases cross and the PLL reacquires, all with less than 0.15 ppm of deviation  \nfrom the original f requency value.  \n1.0\n0.8\n0.2\n–0.4\n–1.0\n1 4\nTIME (Seconds)7 9 10\n13033-0350.6\n0FREQUENCY DEVIATION FROM NOMINAL (ppm)–0.60.4\n–0.2\n–0.8\n0 2 5 3 6 8TRISTATE HOLDOVER MODE ≈ 8 SECONDS\nENABLE REFERENCE AND LOCK\n \nFigure 38. Frequency Deviation from Nominal vs. Time of Tristate Holdover \nEntry and Exit When the Phases Cross Zero  \nThis first method of uncontrolled release suffers from an indeterminate amou nt of time for the p hases to cross and exit \nholdover. However, if it takes 1  sec for the phases to cross, the \nfrequencies are off by only 1  Hz. If it takes 10 sec to cross, the \nerror is 0.1 Hz. If the error is so low that it takes a long time to exit holdo ver, the device is effectively frequency locked. In \nsome applications, being open -loop for this long of a duration \ncan be acceptable, considering the very small frequency errors. \nAlthough  this method of holdover exit is very smooth, it can \ntake a very long  time to occur.  \n \n  \nData Sheet  HMC7044  \n \nRev. C | Page 29 of 71 Resetting the Dividers  \nIf using tristate -based holdover, the second holdover exit \nmethod is recommended. When a reference appears available \n(LOS = 0), the FSM resets the R and N dividers and allows them \nto restart immediately. This appro ach limits the maxim um phase \nerror coming out of holdover to two VCXO cycles (about 8 ns \nfor typical VCXO frequencies). There is no need to wait an \nundetermined amount of time (as in the first method of \nuncontrolled release) to initiate the switch.  \nDAC Ass isted Release \nIf using DAC -based holdover, the DAC and CP can set V TUNE \nconcurrently as the devices exits holdover. With the DAC output \nimpedance at a relatively low setting (for example, 5 Ω), the device \nresets the dividers as in the second method, and then the CP \nattempt s to influence V TUNE. The CP fails, with the DAC sinking \nthe current it is trying to inject into the V TUNE node. Gradually, \nthe device increases the output impedance of the DAC, and the \nCP gains more influence to manipulate V TUNE, pulling the phases \ninto a lignment. Using this DAC assisted CP release method \nlimits the holdover exit transients to within ~1  ppm.  \nFigure 39 to Figure 41 compare the holdover release methods: \nresetting the dividers vs. DAC assisted release, and \nuncontrolled release (which starts with a phase er ror of up to \none PFD period) as the device exits holdover and reacquires to \na reference signal.  \n20\n16\n4\n–8\n–20\n–10 10 40\nTIME (ms)70 90\n13033-03612\n0FREQUENCY DEVIATION FROM NOMINAL (ppm)–128\n–4\n–16\n0 20 50 30 60 80RESET DIVS\n \nFigure 39.

A few megahertz is high enough to allow t he comparison \nfrequency to stay at an offset outside of the PLL2 loop BW and thus suppress any coupling that manages to bypass the PLL1 loop filter.  \nChoosing f LCM \nAt a minimum, f LCM must be a common submultiple of all \navailable references. Typical frequenc ies include 122.88 MHz, \n61.44 MHz, 38.4 MHz, 30.72 MHz, 3.84 MHz, and 1.92 MHz. This f\nLCM clock is the main clock for the PLL1 digital logic. This \nclock rate also scales the PLL1 lo ck detect timer  speeds/thresholds, \nholdover ADC averaging times, and LOS as sertion and \nrevalidation delays. Higher frequencies slightly improve the  \nresponse times to reference interruptions, whereas lower frequencies can slightly reduce current consumption  of the \ndevice by up to ~10  mA. Values in the 30 MHz to 70 MHz \nrange are re commended.  \nProgram the PLL1 lock detect timer threshold based on the \nPLL1 loop BW and f\nLCM of the user.  \nThere are reserved registers, as described in the Control Register \nMap Bit Descriptions section, that must be reprogrammed from \ntheir default values. For example, Register 0x00A5 must be set \nfrom 0x00 to 0x06.  \nCOMPONENT BLOCKS —OUTPUT PLL (PLL2)  \nPLL2 Overview  \nPLL2 is a very low noise integer PLL designed to multiply the \nfrequency from the VCXO to the VCO. It typic ally operates \nwith a loop BW  of 10 kHz to 700 kHz. Use bandwidths on the \nlower end of the r ange to preserve the inherent VCO phase \nnoise at 800 kHz offset (useful in GSM -based systems), where \nbandwidths on the upper end can provide the best integrated \nphas e noise/jitter values.  \nInternally, PLL2 has a number of features that allow it to \nefficient ly achieve a Banerjee floor FOM of −232 dBc and a \nflicker FOM of −266 dBc. The combination of the on -board \nVCO, an internal VCXO doubler, a low N2 minimum divide ratio, and the ability to clock the PFD at up to 250 MHz results \nin an integrated jitter (at 1 2 kHz to 20 MHz) of 44.0 fs  typical.  \n \n PLL2 has the following features:  \n• Lock detect  \n• Frequency doubler  \n• Partially integrated loop filter  \n• VCO selection, external VCO us e \n• VCO calibration  \n• Multichip synchronization via PLL2  \nLock Detect  \nThe lock detect function o f PLL2 behaves the same way as in \nPLL1. It counts the number of consecutive PFD clock cycles \nthat occur with a low phase error. When it reaches a count of \n512, it de clares lock. The threshold of 512 is adjustable, but \nbecause the PLL2 loop BW does not vary  as much as PLL1, it is \nexpected that the user never needs to change this threshold.  \nFrequency Doubler  \nThe user can engage a frequency doubler after the VCXO buffer \nand before the reference divider (see Figure  35). The frequency \ndoubler assumes an approximate 50% input duty cycle, where \nany duty cycle distortion can result in a spur, at f PD2/2, sup -\npressed by the PLL2 loop fil ter. Use of the frequency d oubler is \nhighly recommended to achieve the best spectral performance, \nprovided the PFD is kept under its 250 MHz frequency limit.  \nPartially Integrated Loop Filter  \nAlthough the large components for the PLL2 loop filter are off \nchip, there is a small on -chip resister/capacitor (RC) section \nformed with R = 80 Ω and C = 4.7 pF in series. This RC section \nforms a higher order pole at ~420 MHz. For practical condi -\ntions, this filter segment does not affect the stability of the loop.  \nOFF-CHI P\nCP VCO\n4.7pF80Ω\n13033-037 \nFigure 42.

VCO Input Network  \nVCO Calibration  \nThe on -board VCOs contain an AGC loop that regulates the \ncore voltage of the oscillator to achieve the desired swing and \nthus the trade -off between phase- noise and power consump -\ntion. This AGC l oop uses large external bypass capacitors to \neliminate the noise impact of the AGC loop, and therefore takes \ntime to settle after power -up, sleep, or after changing the VCO \nSelection[1:0] setting. With the 100 nF/1 μF  configuration, \nsettling time takes approximately 10 ms (typical).   \nEach of the VCOs in the HMC70 44 has 32 frequency bands. \nNormally, three or more subbands can synthesize any particular  \nfrequency, and an on -board autotune algorithm selects the \nsolution  that provides tuning margin for temperature fluctuations. \nTemp erature compensation is applied in side to ensure the device \ncan be calibrated at any frequency and maintain lock as the \nfrequency i s carried to any other frequency in the operating \nrange.  \nThe autotune is triggered by toggling the restart dividers/FSMs \nbit in Register 0x0001, Bit 1, after R 2 and N2 are programmed, \nthe VC XO is applied, and the VCO peak detector loop has  settled.  \nWhen the VCXO is applied to the system and the R2 and N2 divide ratios are programmed, the autotune algorithm has the \ninformation needed to find the appropriate band of the  VCO.  \nMultichip Synchroni zation via PLL2  \nTo synchronize multiple HMC7044 devices together, it is  recom -\nmended to use the SYNC input pin. If the SYNC pi n transitions \nfrom 0 to 1 with  sufficient setup/hold margin with respect to  the \nVCXO, this synchronization event is deterministi cally carried \nthrough PLL2, up the timing chain through the N2 divider, and then to the master SYSREF timer (see the Clock Output Network  \nsection for more information). This mechanism of deterministic \nphase adjustment allows synchronization of the SYSREF timer \nand output phase s of multiple HMC7044 devices. Apply the SYNC input rising edge only once. After sensing the rising edge on the VCXO domain, th e SYNC input is ignored \nfor the next 16 × 6 t\nPD2 periods as the FSM processes the event. \nAfter this period expires, the FSM becomes sensitive again to the SYNC pin. If the SYNC is applied periodically, the first edge \ninitializes the synchronization process, and then the subsequent \nedges may or may not b e recognized depending on their \nwidth/repetition rate with respect to 16 × 6 t\nPD2. \nNote that the SYNC risin g edge must be provided cleanly with \nrespect to the HMC7044 VCXO input pin (OSCIN/ OSCIN ). \nThe user normally has access to the CLKINx/ CLKINx  pins of \nPLL1 , and not to the VCXO signal directly. When PLL1 is locked, \nhowever, the VCXO rising edg e is roughly aligned to the PLL1 \nactive reference, and, therefore, the user has indirect knowledge \nof the phase of the VCXO. The VCXO is also available as an \noutput of the HMC7044, if the user wants to retime the SYNC \nsignal more directly.  \nThe phase offset of the PLL1 active reference with respect to the VCXO is a function of the internal delay of each p ath. This base \ndelay offset  is a function of deterministic conditions (LCM, R1, \nN1 divider setpoints, termination setups, and slew rates), but is also \nsubject to PVT variations that compress or exaggerate this offset.  \nFor most practical purposes, the multi chip synchronization \nfeatur e is limited to PLL1 reference rates <200 MHz.  \nCLOCK OUTPUT NETWORK  \nIn the HMC7044, PLL1 is responsible for frequency cleanup, \nredundancy, and hitless switching.  PLL2 and the VCOs handle \nintegrated jitter and performance at an 800 kHz offset.  Although \nthe PLL1/PLL2 and VCXO components are important, much of \nthe uniqueness of a JESD204B clock generation chip relates to \nits array of  output channels.  \nIn a device such  as the HMC7044, some of the output network \nrequirements include the following:  \n• Very good pha se noise floor of the DCLK channels that \ncan be connected to critical data converter sample clo ck \ninputs  \n• A large number of DCLK and SYSREF channels  \n• Deterministic phase alignment between all output \nchannels relative to one another  \n• Fine phase control of sync hronization channels with \nrespect to the DCLK channel  \n• Frequency coverage to satisfy typical clo ck rates in \nexpectant systems  \n• Skew between SYSREF and DCLK channels that is much \nless than a DCLK period  \n• Spur and crosstalk performance that does not impact system budgets  \n \n \nHMC7044  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 32 of 71 The HMC7044 output network also supports the following \nrecommended features, which are sometimes critical in user \napplications:  \n• Deterministic synchronization of the output channels with \nrespect to an externa l signal, which allows multichip \nsynchronization and clean e xpansion to larger systems \n• Pulse generator behavior to temporarily generate a synchronization pulse stream at user request  \n• Flexibility to define unused JESD204B SYSREF and DCLK \nchannels for other  purposes  \n• Glitchless phase control of signals relative to ea ch other  \n• 50% duty cycle clocks with odd division ratios  \n• Multimode output buffers with a variety of swings and termination options  \n• Skew between all channels that is much less than a DCLK period  \n• Adjustable performance vs. power consumption for less \nsensitive  clock channels  \n• Flexibility to use an external VCO for very high performance application requirements  Each of the 14 output channels are logically identical. The only \ndistinction between the SYSRE F and DCLK channels is in the \nSPI configuration and in how t hey are used. Each channel \ncontains independent dividers, phase adjustment, and analog delay circuits. This combination provides the ultimate  flexibility, \ncleanly accommodating nonJESD204B devices  in the system.  \nIn addition to the 14 output channel divider s, there is an  internal \nSYSREF timer that continually operates, and the  synchronization \nof the output channel dividers occurs deterministically with respect to this timer, which can be rephased ex ternally by the  user.  \nThe pulse generator functionality of t he JESD204B standard \ninvolves temporarily generating SYSREF output pulses, with \nappropriate phasing, to downstream devices. The centralized \nSYSREF timer and its associated SYNC/pulse generator con trol \nmanage the process of enabling the intended SYSREF chan nels, \nphasing them, and  then disabling them for signal integrity and \npower saving advantages.  \nDQRF SYNCSYSREF INPUT NETWORK\nPULSE GENER ATOR REQUEST (FROM SPI, GPI, OR SYNC PIN)RESET\nSYNC REQUEST (FROM SPI OR GPI)\nSYNC_FSM_S TATEOUTPUT CHANNE L × 14VCO PATHSYNC FROM PLL2 N DIVIDER\n(DUE TO SYNC PIN EVENT)\nSYSREF\nTIMER\nSYNC/\nPULSE GENER ATOR\nCONTRO L\nLEAF\nCONTROLLER\nCLOCK\nGATINGDIVIDERDIGITAL DEL AY\nAND RETIME\n13033-039 \nFigure 44.

C | Page 33 of 71 Basic Output Divider Channel  \nEach of the 14 output channels are logically identical, and  support \ndivide ratios from 1 to 4094. The supported odd divide ratios \n(1, 3, 5) have 50.0% duty cycle. The only  distinction between a \nSYSREF channel and a DCLK channel is in the SPI config ura-\ntion and the typical usage of a given channel.  \nFor basic functionality and phase control, each output path \nconsists of the following:  \n• Divider —generates the logic signal of the appropriate \nfrequency and phase \n• Digital phase adjust —adjusts the phase of ea ch channel in \nincrements of ½ VCO cycles  \n• Retimer —a low noise flip flop to retime the channel, \nremoving any accumulated jitter  \n• Analog fine delay —provides a number of ~25 ps delay steps  \n• Selection mux —selects the fundamental, divider, or analog \ndelay, or an a lternate path  \n• Multimode output buffer —low noise LVDS, CML, CMOS, \nor LVPECL  \nThe digital phase adjuster and retimer launch on either clock \nphase of the VCO, depending on the digital phase adjust setpoint \n(Coarse Digital Delay[4:0]).  \nTo support divider sync hronization, arbitrary phase slips, and \npulse generator modes, the following blocks are included:  \n• A clock gating stage pauses the clock for synchronization \nor slip operations  \n• An output channel leaf (×14) controller manages slip, \nsynchronization, and pulse  generators with information \nfrom the SYSREF FSM  \nEach channel has an array of control signals. Some of the  controls \nare described in Table 15. System wide broadcast si gnals can be triggered from the SPI or \ngeneral -purpose input (GP I) port to issue a SYNC command \n(to align dividers to the system internal SYSREF timer), issue a \npulse generator stream, (temporarily exporting SYSREF signals to  \nreceivers), or to cause the di viders to slip a number of VCO \ncycles to adjust their phases.  \nIndividual dividers can be made sensitive to these events by \nadjusting their slip enable, SYNC enable, and Start -Up Mode[1:0] \nconfiguration, as described in Table 16. \nWhen output buffers are configured in CMOS mode and phase \nalignment is required among the outputs, additional multislip \ndelays must be issued for Channel 0, Channel 3, Channel 5, \nChannel 6, Channel 9, Channel 10, and Channel 13. The value \nof the delay must be as large as half of the selected divider rat io. \nNote that this requirement of having additional multislip delays \nis not needed when channels are used in LVPECL, CML or \nLVDS  mode.  \nIf a channel is configured to behave as a pulse generator, to \ntemporarily power up and power down according to GPI, SPI, \nor SYNC pin pulse generator commands, it has additional controls to define its  behavior outside of the pulse generator \nchain (se e Table 17). \nEach divider has an additional phase offset register that adjusts its sta rt phase, or to influence the behavior of slip events sent \nvia the SPI (see Table 18).  \nTable 19 outlines the typical configuration combinations for a \nDCLK channel relative to a SYSREF syn chronization channel. \nNote that other combinations are possible. Synchronization of downstream devic es can be managed manually, or by using the \npulse generator functionality of the HMC7044 . See the Typical \nProgramming Sequence  section for more information about the \ndifferences between the two methods.  \nHMC7044  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 34 of 71 Table 15.

Because the divider path consumes power and \ndegrades phase noise  slightly, the fundamental mux path is recommended, but at a cost of a deterministic \nskew vs. a path that is divider based. Such skew can be compensated for with delay (digital and analog) on \nthe divider -based path.  \n \nTable 16. Cha nnel Features  \nBit Name  Description  \nSlip Enable  Slip enable. A channel processes slip requests broadcast from the SPI or GPI (or, if multislip enable = 1, initiated \nfollowing a recognized SYNC or pulse generator startup).  \nSYNC Enable  SYNC enable. A chann el processes synchronization events broadcast from the SPI or GPI or due to SYNC/RF SYNC (via \nthe SYSREF FSM) to reset its phase. This signal can be safely toggled on and off to adjust SYNC sensitivity without \nrisking the state of the divider.  \nStart -Up Mo de[1:0]  00 =  asynchronous (normal mode). The  divider starts with uncontrolled phase. It is rephased by SYNC events if SYNC \nenable = 1.   \n11 =  dynamic ( pulse generator mode). The d ivider monitors pulse generator events broadcast from the SYSREF \ncontroller. It is powered up just before a pulse generator chain, rephased at the start, and powered down after the \npulse generator chain. This is only supported for divide ratios > 31.  \n \nTable 17. Pulse Generator Mode Behavior Options \nBit Nam e Description  \nDynamic Driver Enable  Dynamic output buffer enable ( pulse generator mode only).   \n 0 = the output buffer is simply enabled/disabled with the main channel enable.   \n1 = the output buffer enable is controlled together with the channel divider,  which allows it to dynamically power \ndown outside pulse generator events.  \nForce Mute[1:0]  Force mute for dynamic mode. If 10, and the channel enable is true (channel enable = 1), the signal just before the \noutput buffer is asynchronously forced to Logic 0 when not generating pulses. Otherwise, if 00, outputs a re forced \nto float naturally to V CM. To see the effect of this, the output buffer must be enabled, which is dependent on the \ndynamic driver enable and Start -Up Mode[1:0] controls. Logic 0 is supporte d for CML, LVPECL and CMOS driver modes.  \n \nData Sheet  HMC7044  \n \nRev. C | Page 35 of 71 Table 18. Multislip Configuration  \nBit Name  Description  \nMultislip Enable  Allow multislip. This bit d etermines whether the 12 -Bit Multislip Digital Delay[11:0] parameter is used for multisl ip \noperations. Note that a multislip operation is automatically started following a SYNC or pulse generator initiation if \nmultislip enable = 1.  \n12-Bit Multislip Digital \nDelay[11:0]  Multislip amount . If multislip enable = 1, any slip events (caused by GPI,  SPI, SYNC, or pulse generator events ) repeat the \nnumber of times set by 12- Bit Multislip Digital Delay[11:0] to adjust the phase by the multislip amount × VCO cycles. A \nvalue of 0 is not supported if multislip enable = 1. Note that phase slips are free fr om a noise and current perspective, \nthat is, no additional power is needed and with no noise degradation, but they take some time to occur. Each slip \noperation takes a number of nanoseconds to complete, and thus the phases do not necessarily stabilize imme diately. \nAn alarm is available for th e user to indicate when all phase operations are complete.   \n \nTable 19.

It sequences the  enable, \nreset, and startup, and disables the downstream dividers in the \nevent of SYNC or pulse generator requests. Program the  SYSREF \ntimer count to a submultiple of the lowest output frequency in \nthe clock network, and not faster than 4 MHz. To synchronize \ndivider channels, it is recommended, though not required, that \nthe SYSREF Timer[11:0] bits be set to a related frequency that \nis either a factor or multiple of other frequencies on t he IC.  \nThe pulse generator is defined with respect to the periods of this SYSREF timer, not with respect to the output period. This \nleads to timing constraint that mus t be considered to prevent \nany runt pulses from affecting the pulse generator stream.  Figure 46 shows the start -up behavior of an example divider \nthat is configured as a pulse generator, with a period matching \nthe internal SYSREF period.  \nThe startup of the pulse stream occurs a fixed number of VCO \ncycles after the FSM transitions to the start phase. Disabling the \npulse generator stream where the logic path is forced to zero \ncomes from a combinational path, directly from the FSM.  \nBecause the divider has the option for nearly arbitrary phase \nadjustment , it provides the opportunity for the stop condition \nto arrive when the pulse stream is a Logic 1 and  creates a runt \npulse.  \nFor phase offsets of zero to 50% − 8 VCO cycles, and VCO \nfrequencies <3 GHz, this condition is met naturally within the \ndesign. For  fanout only mode >3 GHz, it is recommended to \nuse digital delay or slip offsets to increase the natural phase \noffset and avoid the stress condition.  \nThe situation is avoided by never applying phase offset more \nthan 50% − 8 VCO cycles to an output channel configured as a \npulse generator.  \n \nHMC7044  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Start -Up Behavior of an Example Divider Configured as a Pulse Generator  \nClock Grouping, Skew, and Crosstalk  \nAltho ugh the output channels are logically independent, for \nphysical reasons, they are first grouped into pairs called clock \ngroups. Each clock group shares a reference, an input buffer, \nand a sync retime flip flop originating from the VCO \ndistribution network.  \nThe second level of grouping is according to the s upply pin. \nClock Group 1 (Channel 2 and Channel 3) are on an independ -\nent supply, and the other supply pins are each responsible for \ntwo clock groups.  As the output channels are more tightly coupled (by s haring a \nclock group, or by sharing a supply pin), the skew is minimized. \nHowever, the isolation between those channels suffers.  Table 20 \nshows the clock grouping, and  Table 21 show the typical skew \nand i solation that can be expected and ho w it scales with  distance \nbetween output channels.  \nIsolation improves as either the aggressor or affected  frequencies \ndecreases. Nevertheless, for particularly important clock  channels \nwhere spurious tones must be minimi zed, carefully consider \ntheir freque ncy and channel configurations to isolate continu-\nously running frequencies onto different supply domains. Channels configured as pulse generators are normally not an issue, because they are disabled during normal operat ion. \nData Sheet  HMC7044  \n \nRev. C | Page 37 of 71 Table 20.

Clock Grouping  \nSYSREF Valid In terrupt  \nOne of the challenges in a JESD204B system is to control and minimize the latency from the primary system controller IC, \ntypically an ASIC or FPGA, to the data converters. To estimate \nthe correct amount of latency in the system, the designer must \nknow how long it takes for a master clock generator like the \nHMC7044 to provide the correct output phases at each output \nchannel after r eceiving the synchronization request. Typically, a \nperiod of time is required on the device to implement the \nchange requests on the outputs due to internal state machine \ncycles, data transfers, and any propagation delays. The SYSREF \nvalid interrupt is a fu nction to notify the user that the correct \noutput se ttings and phase relationships are established, \nallowing the user to identify quickly that the desired SYSREF \nand device clock states are presented at the outputs of the \nHMC7044.  \nThe user has the flexibility to assign the SYSREF valid interrupt to a GPO pi n or to use a software flag, set via Register 0x007D, \nBit 2, which the user can  poll as necessary. The flag notifies the \nuser when the system is configured and operating in the desired state, or conversely when it is not ready.  \nHMC7044  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 38 of 71 REFERENCE BUFFER DETAILS  \nInput Termination Network —Common for All Input \nBuffers  \nThe four reference input buffers to PLL1, as well as the VCXO \ninput buffer, share simil ar architecture and control features. \nThe input termination network is configurable to 100 Ω, 200 Ω, \nand 2 kΩ diff erentially. It is typically ac -coupled on the board, \nand uses the on -chip resistive divider to set the internal \ncommon -mode voltage, V CM, to 2 .1 V.  \nBy closing the 50 Ω termination switch (see Figure 48), the \nnetwor k also serves as the termination system for an LVPECL \ndriver. Although the inpu t termination network for the four \nPLL1 reference buffers and the VCXO input buffer is identical, \nthe buffer behind the network is different.  \n2.8V\n4kΩ\n5kΩ\n50Ω50Ω,\n100Ω,\n1kΩ\n50Ω,\n100Ω,\n1kΩ1pF\n13033-045 \nFigure 48. On -Chip Termination Network for VCXO and Reference Buffers  \nPLL1 Reference Buffer Stages  \nThe PLL1 reference buffers use a CMOS input stage, are capable of a wide common -mode input range (0.4 V to 2.4 V ) \nand have hysteresis to support reliable LOS detect ion. These \nbuffers are designed to be driven reliably with an input  swing of \n>375 mV p -p diff (the half swing point of the LVDS standard ) and  \nsupport up to 800 MHz operation. For signal swings that are \nbelow 375 mV p -p diff, the hysteresis of the buffer c an engage \nand shut down the signal to the internal reference paths.  The \nexact input hysteresis threshold varies as a function of  common -\nmode level and input frequency, but generally ranges from \nabout 75 mV p -p diff to 300 mV p -p diff.  \nVCXO Buffer Stage  \nThe VCXO input buffer is implemented with a bipolar input \nstage to mee t the stringent noise requirements of PLL2. Its \ncommon -mode input range is tighter and, if set externally, \nmust be kept between 1.6 V and 2.4 V. This buffer does not have hysteresis and is functional down to very low signal levels. Although the buffer rema ins functional down to these low \nsignal levels, for optimal performance, keep the input power \ngreater than −4 dBm when driven single -ended, or −7 dBm per \nside when driven differentially.  \nRecommendations for Normal Use  \nFor both styles of buffer, unless ther e are extenuating circum -\nstances in the application, use the 100 Ω differential  termination \nto control reflections, use the on -chip dc bias network to set the \ncommon -mode level, and externally ac couple the input signals. \nDo not use receiver side dc termin ation of the LVPECL signal.  Single -Ended Operation  \nThe buffers support single -ended signals with a slightly reduced \ninput sensitivity and bandwidth. If driving these buffers single -\nended, ac couple the unused section of the buffer to ground at \nthe input of  the die.  \nMaximum Signal Swing Considerations  \nThe internal supplies to these buffers are regulated from 3.3 V to 2.8 V using on -chip regulation. With very high power \nrefer ences, the signal swing can be enough to drive the signal \nabove the 2.8  V rail. The E SD network and parasitic diodes are \ngenerally able to shunt the excess power and  protect the \ninternal circuits even above 13 dBm. Nevertheless, to protect from latch -up concerns, the signals on reference inputs must \nnot exceed the 2.8 V internal supply. For a 2.1 V common -\nmode, 50 Ω single -ended source, this 2.8 V limit allows \n~700 mV of amplitude, or 6 dBm of maximum reference \npower.  \nTYPICAL PROGRAMMING SEQUENCE  \nTo initialize the HMC7044 to an operational state, use the \nfollowing programming procedure:  \n1. Connect the HMC7044  to the rated power supplies. No \nspeci fic power supply sequencing is necessary.  \n2. Release the hardware reset by switching from Logic 1 to \nLogic 0) when all supplies are stable.  \n3. Load the configuration updates (provided by Analog Devices)  to specific registers (see Table 74). \n4. Program PLL2. Select the VCO range (high or low). Then \nprogram the dividers (R2, N2, and reference doubler).  \n5. Program PLL1. Set the lock detect timer threshold based \non the PLL1 BW of the user system. Set the LCM, R1, and \nN1 divider se tpoints. Enable the reference and VCXO \ninput buffer terminations.  \n6. Program the SYSREF timer. Set the divide ratio (a submultiple  of the lower output channel frequency). Set the \npulse generator mode configuration, for example, selecting \nlevel sensitive optio n and the number of pulses desired.  \n7. Program the output channels. Set the output buffer modes \n(for example, LVPECL, C ML, and LVDS). Set the divide \nratio, channel start -up mode, coarse/analog delays, and \nperformance modes.  \n8. Wait until the VCO peak detector lo op has stabilized \n(~10 ms after Step 4).  \n9. Ensure that the references are provided to PLL1 and the \nVCXO is powered.  \n10. Issue a software restart to reset the system and initiate \ncalibration. Toggle the restart dividers/FSMs bit to 1 and \nthen back to 0.  \n11. PLL1 star ts to lock in parallel with PLL2 going through its \ncalibration and lock procedure. Wait for PLL2 to be locked \n(takes ~50 μs in typical configurations).  \n12. Confirm that PLL2 is locked by checking the PLL2 lock \ndetect bit.  \nData Sheet  HMC7044  \n \nRev. C | Page 39 of 71 13. Send a sync request via the SPI (set t he reseed request bit) \nto align the divider phases and send any initial pulse \ngenerator stream.  \n14. Wait 6 SYSREF period s (6 × SYSREF Timer[11:0]) to allow \nthe outputs to phase appropriately (takes ~3  μs in typical \nconfigurations).  \n15. Confirm that the outputs hav e all reached their phases by \nchecking that the clock outputs phases status bit = 1.  \n16. At this time, initialize any ot her devices in the system. \nPLL1 may not be locked yet, but the small frequency offset that can result on the output of the HMC7044 is not normally \nsevere enough to cause synchronization or initialization \nfailures. Configure slave JESD204B devices in the system \nto operate with the SYSREF signal outputs from the \nHMC7044. SYSREF channels from the HMC7044 can \neither be on asynchronously , or dynamically, and can  \ntemporarily turn on for a pulse generator stream.  \n17. Wait for PLL1 to lock. This takes ~ 50 ms for a 100 Hz BW  \n(from Step 11).  \n18. When all JESD204B slaves are powered an d ready, send a \npulse generator request to send out a pulse generator chain \non any SYSREF channels programmed for pulse generator \nmode.  \nThe system is now initialized.  \nFor power savings and the reduction of the crosscoupling of \nfrequencies on the HMC7044, s hut down the SYSREF channels.  \n1. Program each JESD204B slave to ignore the SYSREF input channel.  \n2. On the HMC7044 , disable the individual channel enable \nbits of each SYSREF channel.  \nTo resynchr onize one or more of the JESD204B slaves, use the \nfollowing proced ure: \n1. Set the channel enable (and SYNC enable bit) of the \nSYSREF channel of interest.  \n2. To prevent an output channel from responding to a sync \nrequest, disable the SYNC enable mask of each chan nel so \nthat it continues to run normally without a phase \nadjustmen t. \n3. Issue a reseed request to phase the SYSREF channel \nproperly with respect to the DCLK.  \n4. Enable the JESD204B slave sensitivity to the SYSREF \nchannel.  \n5. If the SYSREF channel is in pulse gener ator mode, wait at \nleast 20 SYSREF periods from Step 3, and issue a pulse \ngenerator request.  POWER SUPPLY CONSIDERATIONS  \nThe HMC7044 contains on -board regulators to shield some of \nthe mo re sensitive supplies from external noise and interference as \nmuch as possible. Nevertheless, the user must still take special \ncare to the supply noise profile of the VCC1_VCO supply to \nachieve the intended performance of the device.  \nIn general, a flat inp ut noise of 200 nV/Hz is an equivalent \ncontributor to the VCO noise and causes a 3 dB increase in the \nnoise profile from about 100 kHz to 10 MHz when the VCO is \nthe dominant contributor. This increase e quates to a roughly \none-to-one conversion from dBV to dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset, \nand f OUT = 2.457 GHz, that is, 200 nV/Hz = −134 dBV, and the \nperformance of the VCO at 1 MHz offset at 2.4576 GHz is \n~−134 dBc/Hz. The PSRR of the VCO follows its closed -loop \nnoise profile; therefore, as the offset moves in and the VCO \nprofile becomes higher, the 200 nV/Hz noise stays approxi mately \nequal to the VCO. To stay suitably below the VCO, a  supply \ninput with <50 nV/Hz is recommended on the VCC1_VCO pin \nacross the 100 k Hz to 10 MHz frequency range.  \nThe output buffers are also susceptible to supply noise, b ut to a \nlesser extent. A noise tone of −60 dBV at a 40 MHz offset results in a −90 dBc tone at the output of the buffers in CML \nmode and −85 dBc in LVPECL mode. This re sult is a relatively flat \nfrequency response, and these numbers are measured \ndifferentia lly. Phase noise/spurs caused by supply noise on the \noutput buffers do not scale with output frequency, whereas those on the VCO do.  \nTable 22 lists the supply network of the HMC7044 by pin, \nshowing the relevant functional blocks. Six different usage \nprofiles are defined for the network, not including the output \nchannel supplies, which are accounted for separately.  \nThe values listed under Profile 0 t o Profile 5 in Table 22 and \nTable 23 are the typical currents of that block or feature. If a \nnumber is not listed in a profile column, a typical profile does not exist for that block or feature, but the user can mix and \nmatch features outside of the profile list and  can determine what \nthe power consumption is going to be given the current listings \nper feature.  \n \n  \n \nHMC7044  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 42 of 71 SERIAL CONTROL PORT  \nSERIAL PORT INTERFACE (SPI) CONTROL  \nThe HMC7044 can be controlled via the SPI using 24 -bit \nregisters and three pins: serial port enable (SLEN) serial data \ninput/output ( SDATA), and serial clock (SCLK).  \nThe 24 -bit register, shown in Table 24, consists of the \nfollowing:  \n• 1-bit read/write command  \n• 2-bit multibyte field ( W1, W0)  \n• 13-bit address field (A12 to A0)  \n• 8-bit data field (D7 to D0)  \nTable 24.

The master (host) asserts both SLEN and SDATA to \nindicate a read, fo llowed by a risi ng edge SCLK. The slave \n(HMC7044 ) reads SDATA on the first rising edge of SCLK \nafter SLEN. Setting SDATA high initiates a read.  \n2. The host places the 2 -bit multibyte field to  be written to \nlow (0) on the next two falling edges of SCLK. The \nHMC7044 registers the 2 -bit multibyte field on the next \ntwo rising edges of SCLK.  \n3. The host places the 13 -bit address field  (A12 t o A0) MSB \nfirst on SDATA on the next 13 falling edges of SCLK. The \nHMC7044 registers the 13 -bit address field (MSB first) on \nSDATA over the next 13 rising edges of SCLK.  4. The host re gisters the 8 -bit data on the next eight rising \nedges of SCLK. The HMC704 4 places 8 -bit data (D7 to D0) \nMSB first on the next eight falling edges of SCLK.  \n5. Deassertion of SLEN completes the  register read cycle.  \nTypical Write Cycle  \nA typical write cycle is shown in Figure 49, and occurs as \nfollows:  \n1. The master (host) asserts both SLEN and SDATA to \nindicate a read, followed by a rising edge SCLK. The s lave \n(HMC7044 ) reads SDIO on the first rising edge of SCLK \nafter SLEN. Setting SDATA low initiates a write.  \n2. The host places the 2 -bit multibyte field to be written to \nlow (0) on the next t wo falling edges of SCLK. The \nHMC7044 registers the 2 -bit multibyte field on the next \ntwo rising edges of SCLK.  \n3. The host places the13 -bit addres s field (A12 to A0), MSB \nfirst on SDATA on the next 13 falling edges of SCLK. The \nHMC7044 registers the 13 -bit address field (M SB first) on \nSDIO over the next 13 rising edges of SCLK.  \n4. The host places the 8 -bit data (D7 to D0) MSB fi rst on the \nnext eight falling edges of SCLK. The HMC7044  register \nthe 8 -bit data (D7 to D0) MSB first on the next eight rising \nedges of SCLK.  \n5. The final rising edge of SCLK performs the int ernal data \ntransfer into the register file, updating the configuration of the device.  \n6. Deas sertion of SLEN completes the register write cycle.  \n \n \nSCLK 1\nXREAD W1 W0 A12 A11 A0 D7 D6 D02 3 4 5 16 17 18 24\n13033-046SDATA\nSLEN \nFigure 49.

The noise power of those harmonics can \nfold and influence the overall no ise. \nPower  Degradation  results when the noise floor (−174 dBm/Hz) \nof the measurement system approaches the noise power in the phase noise floor of the signal. For example, a phase noise value \nof−155 dBc/Hz at 0 dBm carrier level is −155 dBm/Hz and is \neasil y measurab le. If, however, the carrier level is −20 dBm, the \nphase noise of –155 dBc/Hz is −175 dBm/ Hz and  is not \nmeasurable below the other noise sources in the system.  \nCalculate the jitter density at f\nOUT as follows:  \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\nπ××=210\n102 _ _OUTfloorPN\nfFLOOR DENSITY JITTER  (8) \nwhere JITTER_DENSIT Y_FLOOR  is the jitter density of floor at \nfOUT. \nCalculate the rms additive jitter due to floor using the following equation:  \nJITTER_RMS_FLOOR  = JITTER_DENSITY_FLOOR  × \n√Observation Bandwidth  (9) \nwhere Observation Bandwidth is the desired integration \nbandwi dth of the n oise with a lower and upper bound offset \nfrom the output carrier frequency.  \n \n \n \nHMC7044  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

RW \n6 High performance \ndistribution path   High performance distribution path select. The VCO clock distributio n \npath has two modes.  \n0 Power priority.  \n1 Noise priority. Provides the option for better noise floors on the divided output signals.  \n5 Reserved   Rese rved \n4 Force holdover   Force PLL1 into holdover mode. A holdover request from the GPI or SPI is debounced inside the device when transferred to the PLL1 FSM \nclock domain (which is nominally at the VCXO or LCM rate). With the \ndebouncer enabled, the delay from forc e holdover assertion to the \nHOLDOVER state is six clock cycles. If the debouncer is bypassed, the \ndelay is two clock cycles. To asynchronously tristate the charge pump, \nthe user can disable the up and down signals from the PFD via Bits[4:3] \n(PLL1 PFD up en able, PLL1 PFD down enable) in the PLL1 PFD control \nregister (Register 0x001B\n). \n3 Mute output drivers   Mutes the output drivers (dividers still run in the background).  \n2 Pulse generator request   Asks for a pulse stream (see the Typical Programming Sequence  \nsection).  \n1 Restart dividers/FSM s   Resets all dividers and FSMs. Does not affect configuration registers.  \n0 Sleep mode  Forces shutdown. PLL1 and PLL2, output network, and I/O buffers are \ndisabled.  \nData Sheet HMC7044\n \nRev. C | Page 53 of 71 Address Bits Bit Name Settings Description Access \n0x0002 [7:3] Reserved  Reserved.
