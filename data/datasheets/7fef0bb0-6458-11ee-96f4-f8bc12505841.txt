The gate of the low side MOSFET is driven either to V\nCC or GND, \ndepending on the state of the input. Similarly, the gate of the high side MOSFET is driven to either BOOST or TS by a supply bootstrapped off of the switching node (TS).\nInput Stage\nThe L TC4444-5 employs CMOS compatible input thresholds \nthat allow a low voltage digital signal to drive standard power MOSFETs. The L TC4444-5 contains an internal voltage regulator that biases both input buffers for high side and low side inputs, allowing the input thresholds (V\nIH = 2.75V, V IL = 2.3V) to be independent of variations in \nVCC. The 450mV hysteresis between V IH and V IL eliminates \nfalse triggering due to noise during switching transitions. However, care should be taken to keep both input pins (TINP and BINP) from any noise pickup, especially in high frequency, high voltage applications. The L TC4444-5 input buffers have high input impedance and draw negligible input current, simplifying the drive circuitry required for the inputs.\nFigure 1. Capacitance Seen by BG and TG During SwitchingOutput Stage\nA simplified version of the L TC4444-5’s output stage is \nshown in Figure 1. The pull-up devices on the BG and TG outputs are NPN bipolar junction transistors (Q1 and Q2). The BG and TG outputs are pulled up to within an NPN V\nBE (~0.7V) of their positive rails (V CC and BOOST, \nrespectively). Both BG and TG have N-channel MOSFET pull-down devices (M1 and M2) which pull BG and TG down to their negative rails, GND and TS. The large voltage swing of the BG and TG output pins is important in driv-ing external power MOSFETs, whose R\nDS(ON)  is inversely \nproportional to the gate overdrive voltage (V GS − V TH).\nRise/Fall Time\nThe L TC4444-5’s rise and fall times are determined by the \npeak current capabilities of Q1 and M1. The predriver that drives Q1 and M1 uses a nonoverlapping transition scheme to minimize cross-conduction currents. M1 is fully turned off before Q1 is turned on and vice versa.\nSince the power MOSFET generally accounts for the ma-\njority of the power loss in a converter, it is important to quickly turn it on or off, thereby minimizing the transition time in its linear region. An additional benefit of a strong \n6BOOSTL TC4444-5\n8TSTG\n7VIN\nUP TO 100V\nQ1\nM1 CGSCGD\n3VCC\n9GND4BGQ2\nM2LOW SIDE\nPOWER\nMOSFETHIGH SIDEPOWER\nMOSFET\nC\nGSCGDLOAD\nINDUCTOR\n44445 FO1\nLTC4444-5\n944445fcpull-down on the driver outputs is the prevention of cross- \nconduction current. For example, when BG turns the low side (synchronous) power MOSFET off and TG turns the high side power MOSFET on, the voltage on the TS pin will rise to V\nIN very rapidly. This high frequency positive \nvoltage transient will couple through the C GD capacitance \nof the low side power MOSFET to the BG pin. If there is an insufficient pull-down on the BG pin, the voltage on the BG pin can rise above the threshold voltage of the low side power MOSFET, momentarily turning it back on. With both the high side and low side MOSFETs conducting, significant cross-conduction current will flow through the MOSFETs from V\nIN to ground and will cause substantial \npower loss. A similar effect occurs on TG due to the C GS \nand C GD capacitances of the high side MOSFET .\nThe powerful output driver of the L TC4444-5 reduces the \nswitching losses of the power MOSFET , which increase with transition time. The L TC4444-5’s high side driver is capable of driving a 1nF load with 8ns rise and 5ns fall times using a bootstrapped supply voltage V\nBOOST-TS  of \n12V while its low side driver is capable of driving a 1nF load with 6ns rise and 3ns fall times using a supply volt-age V\nCC of 12V.Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nThe L TC4444-5 contains an undervoltage lockout detector \nthat monitors V CC supply. When V CC falls below 3.55V, \nthe output pins BG and TG are pulled down to GND and TS, respectively. This turns off both external MOSFETs. When V\nCC has adequate supply voltage, normal operation \nwill resume.\nAdaptive Shoot-Through Protection\nInternal adaptive shoot-through protection circuitry moni-\ntors the voltages on the external MOSFETs to ensure that they do not conduct simultaneously. This feature improves efficiency by eliminating cross-conduction current from flowing from the V\nIN supply through both of the MOSFETs \nto ground during a switch transition. If both TINP and BINP are high at the same time, BG will be kept off and TG will be turned on (refer to the Timing Diagram). If BG is still high when TINP turns on, TG will not be turned on until BG goes low. \nWhen TINP turns off, the adaptive shoot-through protec-\ntion circuitry monitors the level of the TS pin. BG can be turned on if the TS pin goes low. If the TS pin stays high, BG will be turned on 150ns after TINP turns off.\n APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPower Dissipation\nTo ensure proper operation and long-term reliability, \nthe L TC4444-5 must not operate beyond its maximum temperature rating. Package junction temperature can be calculated by:\n T\nJ = TA + P D (θJA) \nwhere: T\nJ = Junction temperature\n T A = Ambient temperature\n P D = Power dissipation\n θJA = Junction-to-ambient thermal resistancePower dissipation consists of standby and switching \npower losses:\n P D = P DC + P AC + P QG\nwhere:\nPDC = Quiescent power loss\nPAC = Internal switching loss at input frequency, f IN\nPQG = Loss due turning on and off the external MOSFET \nwith gate charge QG at frequency f IN\nThe L TC4444-5 consumes very little quiescent current. The DC power loss at V\nCC = 12V and V BOOST-TS  = 12V is \nonly (350μA)(12V) = 4.2mW. OPERATION\nLTC4444-5\n1044445fcAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nAt a particular switching frequency, the internal power loss \nincreases due to both AC currents required to charge and discharge internal node capacitances and cross-conduc-tion currents in the internal logic gates. The sum of the quiescent current and internal switching current with no load are shown in the Typical Performance Characteristics plot of Switching Supply Current vs Input Frequency.\nThe gate charge losses are primarily due to the large AC \ncurrents required to charge and discharge the capacitance of the external MOSFETs during switching. For identical pure capacitive loads C\nLOAD on TG and BG at switching \nfrequency f IN, the load losses would be:\n P CLOAD  = (C LOAD)(f)[(V BOOST-TS )2 + (V CC)2]\nIn a typical synchronous buck configuration, V BOOST-TS  \nis equal to V CC – V D, where V D is the forward voltage \ndrop across the diode between V CC and BOOST. If this \ndrop is small relative to V CC, the load losses can be \napproximated as:\n P CLOAD  = 2(C LOAD)(fIN)(VCC)2\nUnlike a pure capacitive load, a power MOSFET’s gate \ncapacitance seen by the driver output varies with its V GS \nvoltage level during switching. A MOSFET’s capacitive load power dissipation can be calculated using its gate charge, Q\nG. The Q G value corresponding to the MOSFET’s V GS \nvalue (V CC in this case) can be readily obtained from the \nmanufacturer’s Q G vs V GS curves. For identical MOSFETs \non TG and BG:\n P QG = 2(V CC)(QG)(fIN)\nTo avoid damage due to power dissipation, the L TC4444-5 \nincludes a temperature monitor that will pull BG and TG low if the junction temperature rises above 160°C. Normal operation will resume when the junction temperature cools to less than 135°C.Bypassing and Grounding\nThe L TC4444-5 requires proper bypassing on the V\nCC \nand V BOOST-TS  supplies due to its high speed switching \n(nanoseconds) and large AC currents (Amperes). Careless component placement and PCB trace routing may cause excessive ringing. \nTo obtain the optimum performance from the L TC4444-5:A. Mount the bypass capacitors as close as possible \nbetween the V\nCC and GND pins and the BOOST and \nTS pins. The leads should be shortened as much as possible to reduce lead inductance.\nB. Use a low inductance, low impedance ground plane \nto reduce any ground drop and stray capacitance. Remember that the L TC4444-5 switches greater than 3A peak currents and any significant ground drop will degrade signal integrity.\nC. Plan the power/ground routing carefully. Know where \nthe large load switching current is coming from and going to. Maintain separate ground return paths for the input pin and the output power stage.\nD. Keep the copper trace between the driver output pin \nand the load short and wide.\nE. Be sure to solder the Exposed Pad on the back side of \nthe L TC4444-5 package to the board. Correctly soldered to a 2500mm\n2 double sided 1oz copper board, the \nL TC4444-5 has a thermal resistance of approximately 40°C/W for the MS8E package. Failure to make good thermal contact between the exposed back side and the copper board will result in thermal resistances far greater than 40°C/W .  \nLTC4444-5\n1144445fc TYPICAL APPLICATION\nL TC3780 High Efficiency 36V to 72V V IN to 48V/6A Buck-Boost DC/DC Converter \nEfficiencyPGOOD\nSSSENSE\n+\nSENSE–\nITH\nVOSENSE\nSGNDRUNFCBPLLFL TRPLLINSTBYMDBOOST1\nTG1\nSW1\nV\nIN\nEXTV CC\nINTV CC\nBG1\nPGND\nBG2\nSW2\nTG2\nBOOST21\n23456789\n10111224\n2322212019181716151413L TC3780EG10k\n100Ω\n100Ω220k\nVOS+\n15k\n220k487k\n1%8.25k\n1%1000pF\n100pF\n47pF\nVIND50.1μF\n100V68pF0.022μF\n0.1μF\n16V\n2.2μF , 100V , TDK C4532X7R2A225MT\nC1: SANYO 100ME100HC +TC2, C3: SANYO 63ME220HC + TD1: ON SEMI MMDL770T1GD2: DIODES INC. 1N5819HW-7-FD3, D4: DIODES INC.
