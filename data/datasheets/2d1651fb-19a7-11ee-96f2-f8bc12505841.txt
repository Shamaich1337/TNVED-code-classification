Fast switching speed coupled with high signal bandwidth also make the parts suitable for video signal switching. CMOS construction ensures ultralow power \ndissipation, making the parts ideally suited for portable and \nbattery-powered instruments. The ADG411, ADG412, and ADG413 contain four independent \nSPST switches. The ADG411 and ADG412 differ only in that the digital control logic is inverted. The ADG411 switches are \nturned on with a logic low on the appropriate control input, while a logic high is required for the ADG412. The ADG413 has two switches with digital control logic similar to that of the ADG411 while the logic is inverted on the other two switches. \nEach switch conducts equally well  in both directions when on, \nand each has an input signal range that extends to the supplies. \nIn the off condition, signal levels up to the supplies are blocked. \nAll switches exhibit break-before-make switching action for use in multiplexer applications. Inherent in the design is low charge injection for minimum transients when switching the digital inputs. \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Extended signal range  \nThe ADG411, ADG412, and ADG413 are fabricated on an enhanced LC\n2MOS, giving an increased signal range which \nextends fully to the supply rails. \n2. Ultralow power dissipation \n3. Low R ON \n4. Break-before-make switching  \nThis prevents channel shorting when the switches are \nconfigured as a multiplexer. \n5. Single-supply operation  \nFor applications where the analog signal is unipolar, the ADG411, ADG412, and ADG413 can be operated from a \nsingle-rail power supply. The parts are fully specified with a \nsingle 12 V power supply and remain functional with single supplies as low as 5 V . \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAMS \nIN1\nIN2IN3IN4S1\nD1\nS2\nD2\nS3\nD3\nS4\nD4ADG411\nSWITCHES SHOWN FOR A LOGIC 1 INPUT\n00024-001 \nFigure 1.

D | Page 10 of 16 APPLICATIONS \nFigure 13  illustrates a precise, fast, sample-and-hold circuit. An \nAD845 is used as the input buffer while the output operational \namplifier is an AD711. During the track mode, SW1 is closed and the output V\nOUT follows the input signal V IN. In the hold \nmode, SW1 is opened and the signal is held by the hold \ncapacitor C H. \nDue to switch and capacitor leakage, the voltage on the hold \ncapacitor decreases with time. The ADG411/ADG412/ADG413 minimizes this droop due to its low leakage specifications. The droop rate is further minimized by the use of a polystyrene hold capacitor. The droop rate for the circuit shown is typically 30 μV/μs. \nA second switch, SW2, which operates in parallel with SW1, is \nincluded in this circuit to reduce pedestal error. Since both \nswitches are at the same potential, they have a differential effect \non the op amp AD711, which minimizes charge injection effects. Pedestal error is also reduced by the compensation network R\nC and C C. This compensation network also reduces the hold time glitch while optimizing the acquisition time. Using the illustrated op amps and component values, the pedestal error has a maximum value of 5 mV over the ±10 V \ninput range. Both the acquisition and settling times are 850 ns. \n00024-013+15V\n–15V2200pF\nRC\n75ΩCC\n1000pF\nCH\n2200pFVOUT\nADG411\nADG412ADG413SW2SW1\nS\nSDD+15V +5V\n–15VAD845+15V\n–15VVINAD711\n \nFigure 13.
