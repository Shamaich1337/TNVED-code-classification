Description\nThe AT89C4051 is a low-voltage, high-performance CMOS 8-bit microcontroller with \n4K bytes of Flash programmable and erasable read-only memory. The device is man-\nufactured using Atmel’s high-density nonvolatile memory technology and is compatible with the industry-standard MCS-51 instruction set. By combining a versa-\ntile 8-bit CPU with Flash on a monolithic chip, the Atmel AT89C4 051 is a powerful \nmicrocontroller which provides a highly-flexible and cost-effective solution to many embedded control applications.\nThe AT89C4051 provides the following st andard features: 4K bytes of Flash, \n128 bytes of RAM, 15 I/O lines, two 16-bit timer/counters, a five-vector, two-level inter-rupt architecture, a full duplex serial port, a precision analog comparator, on-chip oscillator and clock circuitry. In addition, t he AT89C4051 is designed with static logic \nfor operation down to zero frequency and supports two software-selectable power \nsaving modes. The Idle Mode stops the CP U while allowing the RA M, timer/counters, \nserial port and interrupt system to continue functioning. The power-down mode saves \nthe RAM contents but freezes the oscillator di sabling all other chip functions until the \nnext hardware reset.8-bit \nMicrocontroller with 4K Bytes \nFlash\nAT89C4051\n 1001F–MICRO–6/08\n 2\n1001F–MICRO–6/08AT89C4051 2.

Pin Description\n4.1 VCC\nSupply voltage.\n4.2 GND\nGround.\n4.3 Port 1\nPort 1 is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port. Port pins P1.2 to P1.7 provide internal pullups. P1.0 and \nP1.1 require external pullups. P1.0 and P1.1 also serve as the positive input (AIN0) and the neg-\native input (AIN1), respectively, of the on-chip precision analog comparator. The Port 1 output \nbuffers can sink 20 mA and can drive LED displays directly. When 1s are written to Port 1 pins, \nthey can be used as inputs. When pins P1.2 to P1 .7 are used as inputs and are externally pulled \nlow, they will s ource current (IIL) because of the internal pullups.\nPort 1 also receives code data duri ng Flash programming and verification. \n4.4 Port 3\nPort 3 pins P3.0 to P3.5, P3.7 are seven bi-directional I/O pins with internal pullups. P3.6 is \nhard-wired as an input to the output of the on-chip comparator and is not accessible as a gen-eral-purpose I/O pin. The Port 3 output buffers c an sink 20 mA. When 1s are written to Port 3 \npins they are pulled high by the internal pullups and can be used as inputs. As inputs, Port 3 pins \nthat are externally being pu lled low will source current (I\nIL) because of the pullups.\nPort 3 also serves the functions of various sp ecial features of the AT89C4051 as listed below:\nPort 3 also receives some control signals for Flash programming and verification.\n4.5 RST\nReset input. All I/O pins are reset to 1s as soon  as RST goes high. Holding the RST pin high for \ntwo machine cycles while the oscilla tor is running resets the device.\nEach machine cycle takes 12 oscillator or clock cycles.\n4.6 XTAL1\nInput to the inverting oscillato r amplifier and input to the in ternal clock operating circuit.Port Pin Alternate Functions\nP3.0 RXD (serial input port)\nP3.1 TXD (serial output port)P3.2 INT0\n (external interrupt 0)\nP3.3 INT1  (external interrupt 1)\nP3.4 T0 (timer 0 external input)P3.5 T1 (timer 1 external input)\n 4\n1001F–MICRO–6/08AT89C4051 4.7 XTAL2\nOutput from the invert ing oscillator amplifier.\n5. Oscillator Characteristics\nXTAL1 and XTAL2 are the input and output, respectively, of an inverting amplifier which can be \nconfigured for use as an on-chip oscillator, as shown in Figure 5-1 . Either a quartz crystal or \nceramic resonator may be used. To drive the de vice from an external  clock source, XTAL2 \nshould be left unconnected while XTAL1 is driven as shown in Figure 5-2 . There are no require-\nments on the duty cycle of the exte rnal clock signal, since the i nput to the inte rnal clocking \ncircuitry is through a divide-by-two flip-flop,  but minimum and maximum voltage high and low \ntime specifications must be observed.\nFigure 5-1.

Special Function Registers\nA map of the on-chip memory area called the Special Function Register (SFR) space is shown in \nthe Table 6-1 .\nNote that not all of the addresses are occupied, and unoccupied addresses may not be imple-\nmented on the chip. Read accesse s to these addresses will in gener al return random data, and \nwrite accesses will have an  indetermin ate effect.\nUser software should not write 1s to these unlisted locations, since they may be used in future \nproducts to invoke new features. In that case, the reset or inac tive values of the new bits will \nalways be 0.\nTable 6-1.

Restrictions on Certain Instructions\nThe AT89C4051 is an economical and cost-effective  member of Atmel’s growing family of micro-\ncontrollers. It contains 4K bytes of Flash progra m memory. It is fully comp atible with the MCS-51 \narchitecture, and can be programmed using the MCS-51 instruction set. However, there are a few considerations one must keep in mind when utilizing certain instructions to program this \ndevice.\nAll the instructions related to ju mping or branching should be restricted such that the destination \naddress falls within the physical program memory  space of the device, which is 4K for the \nAT89C4051. This should be the responsibility of the software programmer. For example, LJMP \n0FE0H would be a valid instruction for the AT89C4051 (with 4K of memory), whereas LJMP 1000H would not.\n7.1 Branching Instructions\nLCALL, LJMP, ACALL, AJMP, SJMP, JMP @A+DPTR . These unconditional branching instruc-\ntions will execute correctly as long as the programmer keeps in mind that the destination \nbranching address must fall within the physical boundaries of the program memory size (loca-\ntions 00H to FFFH for the 89C4051). Violating the physical space limits may cause unknown \nprogram behavior.\nCJNE [...], DJNZ [...], JB, JNB, JC, JNC, JBC, JZ, JNZ.  With these conditional branching \ninstructions the same rule above applies. Again, violating the memory boundaries may cause \nerratic execution.\nFor applications involving interrupts, the normal interrupt service routine address locations of the \n80C51 family architecture have been preserved.\n7.2 MOVX-related Instru ctions, Data Memory\nThe AT89C4051 contains 128 bytes of internal data memory. Thus, in the AT89C4051 the stack \ndepth is limited to 128 bytes, the amount of ava ilable RAM. External DA TA memory access is \nnot supported in this device, nor is external Program memory execution. Therefore, no MOVX \n[...] instructions should be included in the program.\nA typical 80C51 assembler will still as semble instructions, even if they are written in violation of \nthe restrictions mentioned above. It is the responsibility of the co ntroller user to know the physi-\ncal features and limitations of the device being used and adjust the instructions used correspondingly.\n8. Program Memory Lock Bits\nOn the chip are two lock bits which can be left unprogrammed (U) or can be programmed (P) to \nobtain the additional features listed in the Table 8-1 .\nNote: 1. The Lock Bits can only be erased with the Chip Erase operation.Table 8-1. Lock Bit Protection Modes(1)\nProgram Lock Bits\nProtection Type LB1 LB2\n1 U U No program lock features\n2 P U Further programming of the Flash is disabled\n3 P P Same as mode 2, also verify is disabled\n 7\n1001F–MICRO–6/08 AT89C4051\n9. Idle Mode\nIn idle mode, the CPU puts itself to sleep while all the on-chip peripherals remain active. The \nmode is invoked by software. The content of the on-chip RAM and all the special functions regis-\nters remain unchanged during this mode. The idle mode can be terminated by any enabled interrupt or by a hardware reset.\nP1.0 and P1.1 should be set to “0” if no external pullups are used, or set to “1” if external \npullups are used.\nIt should be noted that when idle is terminated by a hardware reset, the device normally \nresumes program execution, from where it left off, up to two machine cycles before the internal \nreset algorithm takes control. On-chip hardware inhibits access to internal RAM in this event, but access to the port pins is not inhibited. To e liminate the possibility of an unexpected write to a \nport pin when Idle is terminated by reset, the instruction following the one that invokes Idle \nshould not be one that writes to a port pin or to external memory.\n10. Power-down Mode\nIn the power-down mode the oscilla tor is stopped and th e instruction that in vokes power-down is \nthe last instruction executed. The on-chip RAM and Special Function Registers retain their val-\nues until the power-down mode is terminated. The only exit from power-down is a hardware reset. Reset redefines the SFRs but does not change the on-chip RAM. The reset should not be \nactivated before V\nCC is restored to its normal operating level and must be held active long \nenough to allow the oscillato r to restart and stabilize.\nP1.0 and P1.1 should be set to “0” if no external pullups are used, or set to “1” if external \npullups are used.\n11. Brown-out Detection\nWhen VCC drops below the detection threshold, all por t pins (except P1.0 and P1.1) are weakly \npulled high. When VCC goes back up again, an internal Reset is automatically generated after a \ndelay of typically 15 msec. The nominal brow n-out detection threshold is 2.1V ± 10%.\nVCC2.1V 2.1V\nPORT PIN\nINTERNAL RESET\n15 msec.\n 8\n1001F–MICRO–6/08AT89C4051 12. Programming The Flash\nThe AT89C4051 is shipped with the 4K bytes of on-chip PEROM code memory array in the \nerased state (i.e., contents = FFH) and ready to be programmed. The code memory array is pro-\ngrammed one byte at a time. Once the array is programmed, to re-program any non-blank byte, \nthe entire memory array needs to be erased electrically.\nInternal Address Counter: The AT89C4051 contains an internal PEROM address counter \nwhich is always reset to 000H on the rising edge of RST and is advanced by applying a positive \ngoing pulse to pin XTAL1.\nProgramming Algorithm:  To program the AT89C4051, the following sequence is \nrecommended.\n1. Power-up sequence:  \nApply power between VCC and GND pins  \nSet RST and XTAL1 to GND\n2. Set pin RST to “H”  \nSet pin P3.2 to “H”\n3. Apply the appropriate combination of “H” or “L ” logic  \nlevels to pins P3.3, P3.4, P3.5, P3.7 to select one of the programming operations shown in the PEROM Programming Modes table.\nTo Program and Verify the Array:\n4. Apply data for Code byte at location 000H to P1.0 to P1.7.\n5. Raise RST to 12V to enable programming.6. Pulse P3.2 once to program a byte in the PEROM array or the lock bits. The byte-write \ncycle is self-timed and typically takes 1.2 ms.\n7. To verify the programmed data, lower RST from 12V to logic “H” level and set pins P3.3 \nto P3.7 to the appropriate levels. Output data can be read at the port P1 pins.\n8. To program a byte at the next address location, pulse XTAL1 pin once to advance the \ninternal address counter. Apply new data to the port P1 pins.\n9. Repeat steps 6 through 8, changing data and advancing the address counter for the \nentire 4K bytes array or until the end of the object file is reached.\n10. Power-off sequence:  \nset XTAL1 to “L ”  \nset RST to “L ”  \nTur n V\nCC power off\nData  Polling:  The AT89C4051 features Data  Polling to indicate the end of a write cycle. During \na write cycle, an attempt ed read of the last byte written will resu lt in the complement of the writ-\nten data on P1.7. Once the write cycle has been completed, true data is valid on all outputs, and the next cycle may begin. Data\n Polling may begin any time after a write cycle has been initiated.\nReady/Busy : The Progress of byte programming can also be monitored by the RDY/BSY  output \nsignal. Pin P3.1 is pulled low after P3.2 goes Hi gh during programming to indicate BUSY. P3.1 is \npulled High again when programming is done to indicate READY.\n 9\n1001F–MICRO–6/08 AT89C4051\nProgram Verify: If lock bits LB1 and LB2 have not been programmed code data can be read \nback via the data lines for verification:\n1. Reset the internal address counter to 000H by bringing RST from “L ” to “H”.\n2. Apply the appropriate control signals for Read Code data and read the output data at \nthe port P1 pins.\n3. Pulse pin XTAL1 once to advance the internal address counter.4. Read the next code data byte at the port P1 pins.5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the entire array is read.\nThe lock bits cannot be verified directly. Verification  of the lock bits is achieved by observing that \ntheir features are enabled.\nChip Erase:  The entire PEROM array (4K bytes) and the two Lock Bits are erased electrically \nby using the proper combination of control signal s and by holding P3.2 low for 10 ms. The code \narray is written with all “1”s in the Chip Erase operation and must be executed before any non-blank memory byte can be re-programmed.\nReading the Signature Bytes: The signature bytes are read by the same procedure as a nor-\nmal verification of locations 000H, 001H, and 002H, except that P3.5 and P3.7 must be pulled to a logic low. The values returned are as follows. \n(000H) = 1EH indicates manufactured by Atmel\n(001H) = 41H indicates AT89C4051\n13. Programming Interface\nEvery code byte in the Flash array can be writte n and the entire array can be erased by using \nthe appropriate combination of control signals. The write operation cycle is self-timed and once \ninitiated, will automa tically time itself to completion.\nMost major worldwide programming vendors offer support for the Atmel AT89 microcontroller \nseries. Please contact your local programming vendor for the appropriate software revision.\nNotes: 1. The internal PEROM address counter is reset to 000H on the rising edge of RST and is advanced by a positive pulse at \nXTAL1 pin.\n2. Chip Erase requires a 10-ms PROG  pulse.\n3.
