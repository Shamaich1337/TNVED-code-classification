They \nare designed for balanced transmission lines and \nmeet or exceed ANSI standard TIA/EIA-485-A and \nISO 8482:1993. These differential bus transceivers \nare monolithic integrated circuits, designed for \nbidirectional data communication on multipoint bus-\ntransmission lines. The drivers and receivers have \nactive-high and active-low enables, that can be \nexternally connected together to function as direction \ncontrol. Very low device standby supply current, can \nbe achieved by disabling the driver and the receiver.\nThe driver differential outputs and receiver differential \ninputs connect internally to form a differential input/\noutput (I/O) bus port, that is designed to offer \nminimum loading to the bus whenever the driver is \ndisabled or V CC = 0. These parts feature wide positive \nand negative common-mode voltage ranges, making \nthem suitable for party-line applications.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nSN65HVD10\nSOIC (8) 4.90 mm × 3.91 mm SN65HVD11\nSN65HVD12\nSN75HVD10\nPDIP (8) 9.81 mm × 6.35 mm SN75HVD11\nSN75HVD12\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nRT RT\nRA B\nR RE DE DDRA B\nR RE DE DDR\nDR\nRE\nDE\nDA\nBR\nDR\nRE\nDE\nDA\nB\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nTypical Application Diagram\n1The signaling rate of a line is the number of voltage transitions that are made per second expressed in the units bps (bits per second).SN65HVD10 , SN65HVD11 , SN65HVD12\nSN75HVD10 , SN75HVD11 , SN75HVD12\nSLLS505P  – FEBRUARY 2002 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

A standby current of less \nthan\n5 µA can be achieved by disabling both driver and receiver.\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\n9.3 Feature Description\nInternal ESD protection circuits protect the transceiver bus terminals against ±16-kV Human Body Model (HBM) \nelectrostatic discharges and ±4-kV electrical fast transients (EFT) according to IEC61000-4-4.\nThe SN65HVD1x half-duplex family provides internal biasing of the receiver input thresholds for open-circuit, \nbus-idle, or short-circuit fail-safe conditions, as well as a typical receiver hysteresis of 35 mV.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\nWhen the driver enable pin, DE, is logic high, the differential outputs A and B follow the logic states at data input \nD. A logic high at D causes A to turn high and B to turn low. In this case, the differential output voltage defined \nas V OD = V A – V B is positive. When D is low, the output states reverse, B turns high, A becomes low, and V OD is \nnegative.\nWhen DE is low, both outputs turn high-impedance. In this condition, the logic state at D is irrelevant. The DE \npin has an internal pulldown resistor to ground; therefore, when left open, the driver is disabled (high-impedance) \nby default. The D pin has an internal pullup resistor to V CC; therefore, when left open while the driver is enabled, \noutput A turns high and B turns low.\nTable 9-1.

When V ID is negative and lower than the negative input threshold, V IT–, the receiver output, R, turns \nlow. If V ID is between V IT+ and V IT–, the output is indeterminate.\nWhen RE is logic high or left open, the receiver output is high-impedance and the magnitude and polarity of V ID \nare irrelevant. Internal biasing of the receiver inputs causes the output to go fail-safe-high when the transceiver \nis disconnected from the bus (open-circuit), the bus lines are shorted (short-circuit), or when the bus is not \nactively driven (idle bus).\nTable 9-2.

If the \nenable inputs are in this state for less than 60 ns, the device does not enter standby mode. This guards against \ninadvertently entering standby mode during driver or receiver enabling. Only when the enable inputs are held in \nthis state for 300 ns or more, the device is assured to be in standby mode. In this low-power standby mode, most \ninternal circuitry is powered down, and the supply current is typically less than 1 µA. When either the driver or \nthe receiver is re-enabled, the internal circuitry becomes active.SN65HVD10, SN65HVD11, SN65HVD12\nSN75HVD10, SN75HVD11, SN75HVD12\nSLLS505P – FEBRUARY 2002 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN65HVD10  SN65HVD11  SN65HVD12  SN75HVD10  SN75HVD11  SN75HVD12\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

Half-Duplex Transceiver Configurations\n1.Using independent enable lines provides the most flexible control, as it allows the driver and the receiver \nto be turned on and off individually. While this configuration requires two control lines, it allows selective \nlistening into the bus traffic, whether the driver is transmitting data or not.\n2.Combining the enable signals simplify the interface to the controller, by forming a single direction-control \nsignal. In this configuration, the transceiver operates as a driver when the direction-control line is high, and \nas a receiver when the direction-control line is low.\n3.Only one line is required when connecting the receiver-enable input to ground and controlling only the \ndriver-enable input. In this configuration, a node not only receives the data from the bus, but also the data it \nsends and can verify that the correct data have been transmitted.www.ti.comSN65HVD10, SN65HVD11, SN65HVD12\nSN75HVD10, SN75HVD11, SN75HVD12\nSLLS505P – FEBRUARY 2002 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: SN65HVD10  SN65HVD11  SN65HVD12  SN75HVD10  SN75HVD11  SN75HVD12\n10.2 Typical Application\nAn RS-485 bus consists of multiple transceivers connected in parallel to a bus cable. To eliminate line \nreflections, each cable end is terminated with a termination resistor, R T, whose value matches the characteristic \nimpedance, Z 0, of the cable. This method, known as parallel termination, allows higher data rates over a longer \ncable length.\nRT RT\nRA B\nR RE DE DDRA B\nR RE DE DDR\nDR\nRE\nDE\nDA\nBR\nDR\nRE\nDE\nDA\nB\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 10-2. Typical RS-485 Network With Half-Duplex Transceivers\n10.2.1 Design Requirements\nRS-485 is a robust electrical standard suitable for long-distance networking, that may be used in a wide range of \napplications with varying requirements, such as distance, data rate, and number of nodes.\n10.2.1.1 Data Rate and Bus Length\nThere is an inverse relationship between data rate and bus length, meaning the higher the data rate, the shorter \nthe cable length; and conversely, the lower the data rate, the longer the cable may be without introducing data \nerrors. While most RS-485 systems use data rates between 10 kbps and 100 kbps, some applications require \ndata rates up to 250 kbps at distances of 4000 feet and longer. Longer distances are possible by allowing small \nsignal jitter of up to 5 or 10%.\nCable Length (ft)\nData Rate (bps)10000\n1000\n100\n10\n100 1k 10 k 100 k 1M 10 M 100 MConservative\nCharacteristics5%, 10%, and 20% Jitter\nFigure 10-3.

Stubs present a nonterminated piece of bus line, which can introduce \nreflections as the length of the stub increases. As a general guideline, the electrical length or round-trip delay \nof a stub should be less than one-tenth of the rise time of the driver, therefore giving a maximum physical stub \nlength as shown in Equation 1 .\nL(STUB)  ≤ 0.1 × t r × v × c (1)\nwhere\n•tr is the 10/90 rise time of the driver\n•v is the signal velocity of the cable or trace as a factor of c\n•c is the speed of light (3 × 108 m/s)\nPer Equation 1 , Table 10-1  lists the maximum cable-stub lengths for the minimum-driver output rise-times of the \nSN65HVD1x full-duplex family of transceivers for a signal velocity of 78%.\nTable 10-1.

SN65HVD11 and HVD12 are both 1/8 UL \ntransceivers, which means that up to 256 receivers can be connected to the bus. The SN65HVD10 is a 1/4 UL \ntransceiver, and up to 64 receivers can be connected to the bus.\n10.2.1.4 Receiver Fail-safe\nThe differential receivers of the SN65HVD1x family are fail-safe to invalid bus states caused by:\n•Open bus conditions, such as a disconnected connector\n•Shorted bus conditions, such as cable damage shorting the twisted-pair together\n•Idle bus conditions that occur when no driver on the bus is actively driving.\nIn any of these cases, the differential receiver will output a fail-safe logic High state so that the output of the \nreceiver is not indeterminate.\nReceiver fail-safe is accomplished by offsetting the receiver thresholds, such that the input indeterminate range \ndoes not include zero volts differential. To comply with the RS-422 and RS-485 standards, the receiver output \nmust output a High when the differential input V ID is more positive than +200 mV, and must output a Low when \nVID is more negative than –200 mV. The receiver parameters which determine the fail-safe performance are \nVIT(+) and V IT(–). As shown in Section 7.6, differential signals more negative than –200 mV will always cause \na Low receiver output, and differential signals more positive than +200 mV will always cause a High receiver \noutput.\nWhen the differential input signal is close to zero, it is still above the maximum V IT(+) threshold of –10 mV, and \nthe receiver output will be High.www.ti.comSN65HVD10, SN65HVD11, SN65HVD12\nSN75HVD10, SN75HVD11, SN75HVD12\nSLLS505P – FEBRUARY 2002 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: SN65HVD10  SN65HVD11  SN65HVD12  SN75HVD10  SN75HVD11  SN75HVD12\n10.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nTo protect bus nodes against high-energy transients, the implementation of external transient protection devices \nis therefore necessary.

The TPS76333 linear voltage regulator is \nsuitable for the 3.3-V supply.\n12 Layout\n12.1 Layout Guidelines\nOn-chip IEC-ESD protection is sufficient for laboratory and portable equipment, but never sufficient for EFT and \nsurge transients occurring in industrial environments. Therefore, robust and reliable bus node design requires \nthe use of external transient protection devices.\nIt is because ESD and EFT transients have a wide frequency bandwidth from approximately 3 MHz to 3 GHz, \nthat high-frequency layout techniques must be applied during PCB design.\n1.Place the protection circuitry close to the bus connector to prevent noise transients from entering the board.\n2.Use V CC and ground planes to provide low-inductance. Note that high-frequency currents follow the path of \nleast inductance and not the path of least impedance.\n3.Design the protection components into the direction of the signal path. Do not force the transient currents to \ndivert from the signal path to reach the protection device.\n4.Apply 100-nF to 220-nF bypass capacitors as close as possible to the V CC pins of transceiver, UART, and \ncontroller ICs on the board.\n5.Use at least two vias for V CC and ground connections of bypass capacitors and protection devices to \nminimize effective via-inductance.\n6.Use 1-kΩ to 10-kΩ pull-up or pull-down resistors to enable lines to limit noise currents in these lines during \ntransient events.\n7.Insert pulse-proof series resistors into the A and B bus lines if the TVS clamping voltage is higher than \nthe specified maximum voltage of the transceiver bus terminals. These resistors limit the residual clamping \ncurrent into the transceiver and prevent it from latching up.\n8.While pure TVS protection is sufficient for surge transients up to 1 kV, higher transients require metal-oxide \nvaristors (MOVs) which reduce the transients to a few hundred volts of clamping voltage, and transient \nblocking units (TBUs) that limit transient current to less than 1 mA.www.ti.comSN65HVD10, SN65HVD11, SN65HVD12\nSN75HVD10, SN75HVD11, SN75HVD12\nSLLS505P – FEBRUARY 2002 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: SN65HVD10  SN65HVD11  SN65HVD12  SN75HVD10  SN75HVD11  SN75HVD12\n12.2 Layout Example\nMCUR\nRVia to ground\nXCVR\nJMPR\nRRC5\n6\n614 R\n5Via to V CC\nTVS7\n5\nFigure 12-1. SN65HVD1x Layout Example\n12.3 Thermal Considerations\n12.3.1 Thermal Characteristics of IC Packages\nRθJA (Junction-to-Ambient Thermal Resistance)  is defined as the difference in junction temperature to \nambient temperature divided by the operating power.\nRθJA is not a constant and is a strong function of:\n•the PCB design (50% variation)\n•altitude (20% variation)\n•device power (5% variation)\nRθJA can be used to compare the thermal performance of packages when specific test conditions are defined \nand used. Standardized testing includes specification of PCB construction, test chamber volume, sensor \nlocations, and the thermal characteristics of holding fixtures. R θJA is often misused when it is used to calculate \njunction temperatures for other installations.\nTI uses two test PCBs as defined by JEDEC specifications. The low-k board gives average in-use condition \nthermal performance, and it consists of a single copper trace layer 25 mm long and 2-oz thick. The high-k board \ngives best case in-use condition, and it consists of two 1-oz buried power planes with a single copper trace layer \n25 mm long and 2-oz thick. A 4% to 50% difference in R θJA can be measured between these two test cards.\nRθJC (Junction-to-Case Thermal Resistance)  is defined as the difference in junction temperature to case \ndivided by the operating power. It is measured by putting the mounted package up against a copper block cold \nplate to force heat to flow from the die, through the mold compound into the copper block.\nRθJC is a useful thermal characteristic when a heat sink is applied to package. It is not a useful characteristic \nto predict junction temperature, because it provides pessimistic numbers if the case temperature is measured \nin a nonstandard system and junction temperatures are backed out. It can be used with R θJB in 1-dimensional \nthermal simulation of a package system.\nRθJB (Junction-to-Board Thermal Resistance)  is defined as the difference in the junction temperature and the \nPCB temperature at the center of the package (closest to the die) when the PCB is clamped in a cold-plate \nstructure. R θJB is only defined for the high-k test card.\nRθJB provides an overall thermal resistance between the die and the PCB. It includes a bit of the PCB thermal \nresistance (especially for BGAs with thermal balls) and can be used for simple 1-dimensional network analysis of \npackage system, see Figure 12-2 .SN65HVD10, SN65HVD11, SN65HVD12\nSN75HVD10, SN75HVD11, SN75HVD12\nSLLS505P – FEBRUARY 2002 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN65HVD10  SN65HVD11  SN65HVD12  SN75HVD10  SN75HVD11  SN75HVD12\nFigure 12-2.
