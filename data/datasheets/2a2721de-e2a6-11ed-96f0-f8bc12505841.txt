The comparators are available in an ultra-\nsmall, DSBGA package measuring 0.73 mm × 0.73 \nmm, making the TLV40x1 applicable for space-critical \ndesigns like portable or battery-powered electronics \nwhere low-power and fast response to changes in \noperating conditions is required.\nThe factory-trimmed references and precision \nhysteresis combine to make the TLV40x1 appropriate \nfor voltage and current monitoring in harsh, noisy \nenvironments where slow moving input signals must \nbe converted into clean digital outputs. Similarly, brief \nglitches on the input are rejected ensuring stable \noutput operation without false triggering.\nThe TLV40x1 are available in multiple configurations \nallowing system designers to achieve their desired \noutput response. For example, the TLV4021 and \nTLV4041 offer a non-inverting input, while the \nTLV4031 and TLV4051 have an inverting input. \nFurthermore, the TLV4021 and TLV4031 feature an \nopen-drain output stage, while the TLV4041 and \nTLV4051 feature a push-pull output stage. Lastly, \neach comparator in the TLV40x1 family is available \nwith a 0.2V, 0.5V, or 1.2V precision reference.\nDevice Information \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE (1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTLV4021, TLV4031, \nTLV4041, TLV4051DSBGA (4) 0.73 mm × 0.73 mm\nTLV4041, TLV4051 SOT-23 (5) 2.9 mm × 1.6 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nINV+\nV \x01  1.2V+\n– Fixed Threshold\nTLV4021S5xIN OUTV+\nV\x00  REF– \n+Inver\x02ng\nTLV4031\nTLV4051IN OUTV+\nV\x03  REF+\n– Non-Inver\x04ng\nTLV4021\nTLV4041\nTLV40x1 ConfigurationsTLV4021 , TLV4031 , TLV4041 , TLV4051\nSNVSB04C  – MARCH 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

With high-accuracy, switching thresholds options of 0.2V, 0.5 V, 1.2V, and 3.2V, 2uA of \nquiescent current, and propagation delay of 450ns and 2us, the TLV40x1 comparator family enables power \nconscious systems to monitor and respond quickly to fault conditions.\nThe TLV40x1Ry comparators assert the output signal as shown in Table 8-1 . VIT+ represents the positive-going \ninput threshold that causes the comparator output to change state, while V IT- represents the negative-going input \nthreshold that causes the output to change state. Since V IT+ and V IT- are factory trimmed and warranted over \ntemperature, the TLV40x1 is equally suited for undervoltage and overvoltage applications. In order to monitor \nany voltage above the internal reference voltage, an external resistor divider network is required.\nThe TLV4021S5x functions similar to the TLV40x1Ry comparators except the resistor divider is internal to the \ndevice. Having the resistor divider internal to the device allows the TLV4021S5x to have switching thresholds \nhigher than the internal reference voltage of 1.2V without any external components.\nTable 8-1.

The \nTLV40x1 comparators feature a rail-to-rail input stage with factory programmed switching thresholds for both \nrising and falling input waveforms. The comparator family also supports open-drain and push-pull output \nconfigurations as well as non-inverting and inverting inputs.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Power ON Reset (POR)\nThe TLV40x1 comparators have a Power-on-Reset (POR) circuit which provides system designers a known \nstart-up condition for the output of the comparators. When the power supply (V S) is ramping up or ramping down, \nthe POR circuit will be active when V S is below V POR. For the TLV4021 and TLV4031, the POR circuit will force \nthe output to High-Z, and for the TLV4041 and TLV4051, the POR circuit will hold the output low at (V-). When \nVS is greater than, or equal to, the minimum recommended operating voltage, the comparator output reflects the \nstate of the input (IN).\nThe following pictures represent how the TLV40x1 outputs respond for V S rising and falling. For the comparators \nwith open-drain outputs (TLV4021/4031), IN is connected to (V-) to highlight the transition from POR circuit \ncontrol to standard comparator operation where the output reflects the input condition. Note how the output goes \nlow when V S reaches 1.45V. Likewise, for the comparators with push-pull outputs (TLV4041/4051), the input is \nconnected to (V+). Note how the output goes high when V S reaches 1.45V.\nTime (s)Voltage (V)\n-0.3 -0.2 -0.1 00.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8-0.500.511.522.533.544.55\nVS\nVOUT\nFigure 8-1.

The comparator rising threshold is trimmed to the reference voltage (V IT+) while \nthe falling threshold is trimmed to (V IT-). Since the rising and falling thresholds are both trimmed and warranted \nin the Electrical Characteristics Table, the TLV40x1 is equally suited for undervoltage and overvoltage detection. \nThe difference between (V IT+) and (V IT-) is referred to as the comparator hysteresis and is 20 mV for TLV40x1Ry \nand 54 mV for TLV4021S5x. The integrated hysteresis makes the TLV40x1 less sensitive to supply-rail noise \nand provides stable operation in noisy environments without having to add external positive feedback to create \nhysteresis.\nThe comparator input (IN) is able to swing 5.5 V above (V-) regardless of the device supply voltage. This \nincludes the instance when no supply voltage is applied to the comparator (V S = 0 V). As a result, the TLV40x1 \nis referred to as fault tolerant, meaning it maintains the same high input impedance when V S is unpowered or \nramping up. While not required in most cases, in order to reduce sensitivity to transients and layout parasitics for \nextremely noisy applications, place a 1 nF to 100 nF bypass capacitor at the comparator input.\nFor the TLV40x1Ry comparators, the input bias current is typically 10 pA for input voltages between (V-) and \n(V+) and the value typically doubles for every 10°C temperature increase. The comparator input is protected \nfrom voltages below (V-) by an internal diode connected to (V-). As the input voltage goes below (V-), the \nprotection diode becomes forward biased and begins to conduct causing the input bias current to increase \nexponentially. A series resistor is recommended to limit the input current when sources have signal content that \nis less than (V-).\nFor the TLV4021S5x, the input bias current is limited by the internal resistor divider with typical impedance of 2M \nohms.\n8.4.3 Switching Thresholds and Hysteresis (V HYS)\nThe TLV40x1 transfer curve is shown in Figure 8-5 .\n•VIT+ represents the positive-going input threshold that causes the comparator output to change from a logic \nlow state to a logic high state.\n•VIT- represents the negative-going input threshold that causes the comparator output to change from a logic \nhigh state to a logic low state.\n•VHYS represents the difference between V IT+ and V IT- and is 20 mV for TLV40x1Ry and 54 mV for \nTLV4021S5x.\nVIT- V IT+VHYS = (V IT+) ± (VIT-)\nFigure 8-5. Transfer Curve\nVIT+ and V IT- have mV\'s of variation over temperature. The significant portion of the variation of these parameters \nis a result of the internal bandgap voltage from which V IT+ and V IT- are derived. The following hysteresis \nhistograms demonstrate the performance of the TLV40x1 hysteresis circuitry. Since the bandgap reference is \nused to set V IT+ and V IT-, each of these parameters have a tendency to error (track) in the same direction. For \nexample, if V IT+ has a positive 0.5% error, V IT- would have a tendency to have a similar positive percentage \nerror. As a result, the variation of hysteresis will never be equal to the difference of the highest V IT+ value of its \nrange and the lowest V IT- value of its range.www.ti.comTLV4021, TLV4031, TLV4041, TLV4051\nSNVSB04C – MARCH 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: TLV4021  TLV4031  TLV4041  TLV4051\nVHYST (mV)Device Count\n17 18 19 20 21 22 23050100150200250300350400450500Figure 8-6.

VHYST Histogram (TLV40x1S5, V S=5V)\n8.4.4 Output (OUT)\nThe TLV4041 and TLV4051 feature a push-pull output stage which eliminates the need for an external pull-up \nresistor while providing a low impedance output driver. Likewise, the TLV4021 and TLV4031 feature an open-\ndrain output stage which enables the output logic levels to be pulled-up to an external source as high as 5.5 V \nindependent of the supply voltage.\nIn a typical TLV40x1 application, OUT is connected to an enable input of a processor or a voltage regulator such \nas a dc-dc converter or low-dropout regulator (LDO). The open-drain output versions (TLV4021/4031) are used \nif the power supply of the comparator is different than the supply voltage of the device being controlled. In this \nusage case, a pull-up resistor holds OUT high when the comparator output goes high impedance. The correct \ninterface-voltage level is provided (also known as level-shifting) by connecting the pull-up resistor on OUT to the \nappropriate voltage rail. The TLV4021/4031 output can be pulled up to 5.5 V, independent of the device supply \nvoltage (V S). However, if level-shifting is not required, the push-pull output versions (TLV4041/4051) should be \nutilized in order to eliminate the need for the pull-up resistor.TLV4021, TLV4031, TLV4041, TLV4051\nSNVSB04C – MARCH 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV4021  TLV4031  TLV4041  TLV4051\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe TLV40x1 is a 4-pin, low-power comparator with a precision, integrated reference. The comparators in this \nfamily are well suited for monitoring voltages and currents in portable, battery powered devices.\n9.1.1 Monitoring (V+)\nMany applications monitor the same rail that is powering the comparator. In these applications the resistor \ndivider is simply connected to the (V+) rail.\nIN OUTV+\ns5\x03Supply\nFigure 9-1. Supply Monitoringwww.ti.comTLV4021, TLV4031, TLV4041, TLV4051\nSNVSB04C – MARCH 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TLV4021  TLV4031  TLV4041  TLV4051\n9.1.2 Monitoring a Voltage Other than (V+)\nSome applications monitor rails other than the one that is powering the comparator. In these applications the \nresistor divider used to set the desired threshold is connected to the rail that is being monitored.\nVMON\nSupply\nINOUTV+\ns5\x03REFTLV40x1\nFigure 9-2. Monitoring a Voltage Other than the Supply\nThe TLV40x1Ry can monitor a voltage greater than the maximum (V+) with the use of an external resistor divider \nnetwork. Likewise, the TLV40x1 can monitor voltages as low as the internal reference voltage (0.2 V, 0.5 V, \nor 1.2 V). The TLV40x1Ry also has the advantage of being able to monitor high impedance sources since the \ninput bias current of the input (IN) is low. This provides an advantage over voltage supervisors that can only \nmonitor the voltage rail that is powering them.

In these usage \ncases, the output can be pulled up to any voltage that is lower than 5.5V (independent of (V+)). This technique is \ncommonly referred to as "level-shifting."\nVMON\nIN OUTV+\ns5\x03Supply VPULLUP\nRPULLUP(up to 5.5V)\nFigure 9-3.

Figure 9-4  shows a simple under-voltage detection \ncircuit using the TLV4041R1 which is a non-inverting comparator with an integrated 1.2 V reference and a push-\npull output stage. The non-inverting TLV4041 option was selected in this example since the micro-controller \nrequired an active low signal when an undervoltage level occurs. However, if an active high signal was required, \nthe TLV4051 option with an inverting input stage would be utilized.\nVBAT\nINOUTV+\ns5\x03ALERT3.3V\nMicro-\ncontrollerV+\n1.2V+\nt TLV4041R1R1\nR2\nFigure 9-4. Under-Voltage Detection\n9.2.1.1 Design Requirements\nFor this design, follow these design requirements:\n•Operate from 3.3 V power supply that powers the microcontroller.\n•Under-voltage alert is active low.\n•Logic low output when V BAT is less than 2.0V.\n9.2.1.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nConfigure the circuit as shown in Figure 9-4 . Connect (V+) to 3.3 V which also powers the micro-controller. \nResistors R 1 and R 2 create the under-voltage alert level of 2.0 V. When the battery voltage sags down to 2.0 V, \nthe resistor divider voltage crosses the (V IT-) threshold of the TLV4041R1. This causes the comparator output \nto transition from a logic high to a logic low. The push-pull option of the TLV40x1 family is selected since the \ncomparator operating voltage is shared with the microcontroller which is receiving the under-voltage alert signal. \nThe TLV4041 option with the 1.2 V internal reference is selected because it is the closest internal reference \noption that is less than the critical under-voltage level of 2.0 V. Choosing the internal reference option that is \nclosest to the critical under-voltage level minimizes the resistor divider ratio which optimizes the accuracy of \nthe circuit. Error at the falling edge threshold of (V IT-) is amplified by the inverse of the resistor divider ratio. So \nminimizing the resistor divider ratio is a way of optimizing voltage monitoring accuracy.www.ti.comTLV4021, TLV4031, TLV4041, TLV4051\nSNVSB04C – MARCH 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: TLV4021  TLV4031  TLV4041  TLV4051\nEquation 1  is derived from the analysis of Figure 9-4 .\n(1)\nwhere\n•R1 and R 2 are the resistor values for the resistor divider connected to IN\n•VBAT is the voltage source that is being monitored for an undervoltage condition.\n•VIT- is the falling edge threshold where the comparator output changes state from high to low\nRearranging Equation 1  and solving for R 1 yields Equation 2 .\n(2)\nFor the specific undervoltage detection of 2.0 V using the TLV4041R1, the following results are calculated.\n(3)\nwhere\n•R2 is set to 1 MΩ\n•VBAT is set to 2.0 V\n•VIT- is set to1.18 V\nChoose R TOTAL  (R1 + R 2) such that the current through the divider is at least 100 times higher than the input bias \ncurrent (I BIAS).

First, consider the required output high logic \nlevel requirement of the logic device that is being driven by the comparator when calculating the maximum R PU \nvalue. When in a logic high output state, the output impedance of the comparator is very high but there is a finite \namount of leakage current that needs to be accounted for. Use I O-LKG  from the EC Table and the V IH minimum \nfrom the logic device being driven to determine R PU maximum using Equation 4 .\n(4)\nNext, determine the minimum value for R PU by using the V IL maximum from the logic device being driven. In \norder for the comparator output to be recognized as a logic low, V IL maximum is used to determine the upper \nboundary of the comparator\'s V OL. VOL maximum for the comparator is available in the EC Table for specific sink \ncurrent levels and can also be found from the V OUT versus I SINK curve in the Typical Application curves. A good \ndesign practice is to choose a value for V OL maximum that is 1/2 the value of V IL maximum for the input logic \ndevice. The corresponding sink current and V OL maximum value will be needed to calculate the minimum R PU. \nThis method will ensure enough noise margin for the logic low level. With V OL maximum determined and the \ncorresponding I SINK obtained, the minimum R PU value is calculated with Equation 5 .\n(5)\nSince the range of possible R PU values is large, a value between 5 k Ω and 100 k Ω is generally recommended. \nA smaller R PU value provides faster output transition time and better noise immunity, while a larger R PU value \nconsumes less power when in a logic low output state.\n9.2.2.2 Input Supply Capacitor\nAlthough an input capacitor is not required for stability, for good analog design practice, connect a 100 nF low \nequivalent series resistance (ESR) capacitor from (V+) to (V-).\n9.2.2.3 Sense Capacitor\nAlthough not required in most cases, for extremely noisy applications, place a 1 nF to 100 nF bypass capacitor \nfrom the comparator input (IN) to the (V-) for good analog design practice. This capacitor placement reduces \ndevice sensitivity to transients.\n9.3 What to Do and What Not to Do\nDo connect a 100 nF decoupling capacitor from (V+) to (V-) for best system performance.\nIf the monitored voltage is noisy, do connect a decoupling capacitor from the comparator input (IN) to (V-).\nDon\'t use resistors for the voltage divider that cause the current through them to be less than 100 times the input \ncurrent of the comparator without also accounting for the impact on accuracy.\nDon\'t use a pull-up resistor that is too small because the larger current sunk by the output may exceed the \ndesired low-level output voltage (V OL).www.ti.comTLV4021, TLV4031, TLV4041, TLV4051\nSNVSB04C – MARCH 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: TLV4021  TLV4031  TLV4041  TLV4051\n10 Power Supply Recommendations\nThese devices operate from an input voltage supply range between 1.7 V and 5.5 V.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nA power supply bypass capacitor of 100 nF is recommended when supply output impedance is high, supply \ntraces are long, or when excessive noise is expected on the supply lines. Bypass capacitors are also \nrecommended when the comparator output drives a long trace or is required to drive a capacitive load. Due \nto the fast rising and falling edge rates and high-output sink and source capability of the TLV40x1 output stage, \nhigher than normal quiescent current can be drawn from the power supply when the output transitions. Under \nthis circumstance, the system would benefit from a bypass capacitor across the supply pins.\n11.2 Layout Example\nIN\nV- V+VBAT\nC1 (0402)R1 (0402) R2 (0402)\nOUT\nFigure 11-1.
