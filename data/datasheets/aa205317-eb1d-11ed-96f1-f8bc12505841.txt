In smartphones, it finds use in \napplications such as gesture commands for applications and phone control , enhanced gaming, augmented \nreality, panoramic photo capture and viewing, and pedestrian and vehicle navigation.  With its ability to \nprecisely and accurately track user motions, MotionTracking technology can convert handsets and tablets \ninto powerful 3D intelligent devices that can be used in applications ranging from health and fitness \nmonitoring to location -based services.  Key requirements for MotionInterface enabled devices are small \npackage size, low power consumption, high accuracy and repeatability , high shock tolerance, and application \nspecific performance programmability – all at a low consumer price point.  \nThe MPU -60X0 is the world’s first integrated 6 -axis MotionTracking device that combines a 3 -axis \ngyroscope, 3 -axis accelerometer, and a Digita l Motion Processor™ (DMP) all in a small 4x4x0.9mm \npackage.  With its dedicated I2C sensor bus, i t directly accepts inputs from an external 3 -axis compass to \nprovide a complete 9 -axis MotionFusion ™ output.  The MPU -60X0 MotionTracking device, with its 6 -axis \nintegration, on -board MotionFusion™ , and run -time calibration firmware , enables manufacturers to eliminate \nthe costly and complex selection, qualification, and system level integration of discrete devices , guaranteeing \noptimal motion performance for con sumers.   The MPU -60X0 is also designed to  interface with multiple non -\ninertial digital sensors, such as pressure sensors, on its auxiliary  I2C port.  The MPU -60X0 is footprint \ncompatible with the MPU -30X0 family.  \nThe MPU -60X0 features three 16 -bit analog -to-digital converters (ADCs) for digitizing the gyro scope  outputs \nand three 16 -bit ADCs for digitizing the accelerometer outputs.  For precision tracking of both fast and slow \nmotions, the part s feature a user -programmable gyroscope full-scale range  of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and \n±2000°/sec (dps) and a user -programmable accelerometer full -scale range of ±2 g, ±4g, ±8g, and ±16 g. \nAn on -chip 1024 Byte FIFO buffer helps lower system power consumption by allowing the system processor \nto read the sensor data in  bursts and then enter a low -power mode as the MPU  collects more data. With all \nthe necessary on -chip processing and sensor components required to support many motion -based use \ncases, the MPU -60X0 uniquely enabl es low-power MotionInterface applications in portable applications with \nreduced processing requirements for the system processor . By providing  an integrated MotionFusion  output, \nthe DMP in the MPU -60X0 offloads the intensive MotionProcessing  computation requirements from the \nsystem processor, minimiz ing the need for frequent polling of the motion sensor output.  \nCommunication with all registers of the device is performed using either I2C at 400kHz or SPI at 1MHz  \n(MPU -6000 only) . For applications r equiring faster communications,  the sensor and interrupt registers may \nbe read using SPI at 20MHz  (MPU -6000 only) . Additional features include an embedded temperature sensor \nand an on -chip oscillator with ± 1% variation over the operating temperature range . \nBy leveraging its patented and  volume -proven Nasiri -Fabrication platform, which integrates MEMS wafers \nwith companion CMOS electronics through wafer -level bonding, InvenSense has driven the MPU -60X0 \npackage size down to a revolutionary footprint of 4x4x0.9mm (QFN), while providing the highest \nperformance, lowest noise, and the lowest cost semiconductor packaging required for handheld consumer \nelectronic devices.  The part features a robust 10,000 g shock tolerance, and has programmable  low-pass \nfilters for the gyros copes , accelerometers,  and the on -chip temperature sensor.  \nFor power supply flexibility, the MPU -60X0 operates from VDD power supply voltage  range of 2.375 V-3.46V .  \nAdditionally, the MPU -6050 provides a VLOGIC reference pin (in addition to its analog supply pin : VDD), \nwhich set s the logic levels of its I2C interface.  The VLOGIC voltage may be 1.8V±5% or VDD.   \nThe MPU -6000 and MPU -6050 are identical, except that the MPU -6050 supports the I2C serial interface only, \nand has a separate VLOGIC reference pin.  The MPU -6000 supports both I2C and SPI interfaces and has a \nsingle supply pin, VDD, which is both the device’s logic reference supply and the analog supply for the part.  \nThe table below outlines these differences:  \n \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050 Pro duct Specification  Document Number: PS -MPU -6000A -00 \nRevision: 3.4  \nRelease Date: 08/19/2013  \n \n           8 of 52  \n \n \nPrimary

When the gyros are rotated about any of the sense axes, the Coriolis Effect  causes \na vibration that is detected by a capacitive pickoff. The resulting signal is amplified, demodulated, and filtered \nto produce a voltage that is proportional to the angular rate.  This voltage is digitized using individual on -chip \n16-bit Analog -to-Digital Converters (ADCs) to sample each axis.  The full -scale range of the gyro sensors \nmay be digitally programmed to ±250, ±500, ±1000, or ±2000 degrees per second (dps).  The ADC sample \nrate is programmable from 8,000 samples per second, down to 3.9 sam ples per second, and user -selectable \nlow-pass filters enable a wide range of cut -off frequencies.  \n \n7.8 Three -Axis MEMS Accelerometer  with 16 -bit ADCs and Signal Conditioning  \nThe MPU -60X0’s 3 -Axis accelerometer uses separate proof masses for each axis. Acceleration along a \nparticular axis induces displacement on the corresponding  proof mass, and capacitive sensors detect the \ndisplacement differentially. The MPU -60X0’s architecture reduces the accelerometers’ susceptibility to \nfabrication variations as well as to thermal drift. When the device is placed  on a flat surface, it will measure \n0g on the X - and Y -axes and +1 g on the Z -axis. The a ccelerometer s’ scale factor is calibrated at the factory \nand is nominally independent of supply voltage. Each sensor has a dedicated sigma -delta ADC for providing \ndigital outputs. The full scale range of the digital output can be adjusted to ±2 g, ±4g, ±8g, or ± 16g. \n \n7.9 Digital Motion Processor  \nThe embedded Digital Motion Processor (DMP) is located within the MPU -60X0  and offloads co mputation of \nmotion processing algorithms from the host processor. The DMP acquires data from accelerometers, \ngyroscopes, and additional 3rd party sensors such as magnetometers, and processes the data. The resulting \ndata can be read from the DMP’s registers, or can be buffered in a FIFO. The DMP has access to one of the  \nMPU ’s external pins, which can be used for generating interrupts.  \nThe purpos e of the DMP is to offload both timing requirements and processing power from the host \nprocessor. Typically, motion processing algorithms should be run at a high rate, often around 200Hz, in order \nto provide accurate results with low latency. This is requi red even if the application updates at a much lower \nrate; for example, a low power user interface may update as slowly as 5Hz, but the motion processing should \nstill run at 200Hz. The DMP can be used as a tool in order to minimize power, simplify timing, s implify the \nsoftware architecture, and save valuable MIPS on the host processor for use in the application.  \n \n7.10 Primary I2C and SPI Serial Communications Interfaces  \nThe MPU -60X0 communicates to a system processor using either a SPI ( MPU -6000 only) or an I2C serial \ninterface.  The MPU -60X0  always act s as a slave when communicating to the system processor . The LSB of \nthe of the I2C slave address is set by pin 9 (AD0).   \nThe logic levels for communications between the MPU -60X0 and its master are as follows:  \n\uf0b7 MPU -6000: The logic level for communications with the master is set by the voltage on VDD  \n\uf0b7 MPU -6050 : The logic level for communications with the master is set by the voltage on VLOGIC  \nFor further information regarding the logic levels of the MPU -6050, ple ase refe r to Section 10 . \n  \n \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050 Pro duct Specification  Document Number: PS -MPU -6000A -00 \nRevision: 3.4  \nRelease Date: 08/19/2013  \n \n           26 of 52 7.11 Auxiliary  I2C Serial Interface  \nThe MPU -60X0 has a n auxiliary  I2C bus for communicating to an off -chip 3 -Axis digital output  magnetometer  \nor other sensors . This bus has two operating modes:  \n\uf0b7 I2C Master Mode : The MPU -60X0 acts as a master to any external sensors  connected to the \nauxiliary  I2C bus  \n\uf0b7 Pass -Through Mode : The MPU -60X0 directly connects the primary and auxiliary  I2C buses together, \nallow ing the system processor to directly communicate with any extern al sensors .  \nAuxiliary  I2C Bus M odes of Operation:  \n\uf0b7 I2C Master Mode :  Allows the MPU -60X0 to directly access the data registers of external digital \nsensors , such as a magnetometer .  In this mode, the MPU -60X0 directly obtains data from auxiliary \nsensors , allowing the on -chip DMP to generate sensor fusion data without intervention from the \nsystem applications processor.  \nFor example, In I2C Master mode, the MPU -60X0 can be configured to perform burst reads, \nreturning the following data from  a magnetometer : \n\uf0a7 X magnetometer  data (2 bytes)  \n\uf0a7 Y magnetometer  data (2 bytes)  \n\uf0a7 Z magnetometer  data (2 bytes)  \n \nThe I2C Master can be configured to read up to 24 bytes from up to 4 auxiliary sensors. A fifth sensor \ncan be configured to work single byte read/write mode.  \n \n\uf0b7 Pass -Through Mode : Allows an external system processor to act as master and directly \ncommunicate to the external sensor s connected to the auxiliary  I2C bus pins ( AUX_DA and \nAUX_C L). In this mode, the auxiliary  I2C bus control logic ( 3rd party sensor i nterface block) of the \nMPU -60X0 is disabled, and the auxiliary  I2C pins AUX_ DA and AUX_C L (Pins 6 and 7) are \nconnected to the main I2C bus (Pins 23 an d 24) through analog switches.  \n \nPass -Through Mode is  useful for configuring the  external sensor s, or for keeping the MPU -60X0 in a \nlow-power mode  when only the external sensor s are used.  \n \nIn Pass -Through Mode the system processor can still access MPU -60X0 data through the I2C \ninterface.  \n \nAuxiliary  I2C Bus IO Logic Levels  \n\uf0b7 MPU -6000 :  The logic level o f the auxiliary I2C bus is VDD  \n\uf0b7 MPU -6050 :  The logic level of the auxiliary  I2C bus can be programmed to be either VDD or VLOGIC   \n  \nFor further information regarding the MPU -6050’s logic levels, please refer to Section 10.2.  \n  \n \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050 Pro duct Specification  Document Number: PS -MPU -6000A -00 \nRevision: 3.4  \nRelease Date: 08/19/2013  \n \n           27 of 52 7.12 Self-Test \nPlease refer to the MPU -6000/MPU -6050 Register Map and Register Descriptions document  for more details \non self test.  \nSelf-test allows for the testing of the mechanical and electrical portions of the sensors. The self -test for each \nmeasurement axis can be activated by means of  the gyroscope  and accelerometer  self-test registers  \n(registers 13 to 16) .   \nWhen self -test is activated, the electronics cause the sensors to be actuated and produce an output signal. \nThe output signal is used to observe the self -test response.  \nThe self -test response is defined as follows:  \nSelf-test response = Sensor output with self -test enabled – Sensor output without self -test enabled  \nThe self -test response for each accelerometer axis is defined in the accelerometer specification table \n(Section 6.2), wh ile that for each gyroscope axis is defined in the gyroscope specification table (Section 6.1).  \nWhen the value of the self -test response is within the min/max limits of the product specification, the part has \npassed self test.  When the self -test response  exceeds the min/max values, the part is deemed to have failed \nself-test.

In addition, the MPU -60X0 is an \nI2C master to the optional external compass sensor.  The MPU -60X0 has limited capabilities as an I2C \nMaster, and depends on the system processor to manage the init ial configuration of any auxiliary sensors. \nThe MPU -60X0 has an interface bypass multiplexer , which connects the system processor I2C bus  pins 23  \nand 24 (SDA and SCL) directly to the auxiliary sensor I2C bus  pins 6 and 7  (AUX_DA and AUX_CL).  \nOnce the  auxiliary sensors have been configured by the system processor, the interface bypass mu ltiplexer  \nshould be disabled  so that the MPU -60X0 auxiliary I2C master can take control of the sensor I2C bus and  \ngather data from th e auxiliary  sensor s. \nFor further information regarding I2C master control, please  refer to Section 10.  \n \n \nMPU-60X0AD0/SDO\nSCL/SCLK\nSDA/SDI\nDigital \nMotion \nProcessor \n(DMP)9\n23\n24\nSensor \nMaster I2C \nSerial \nInterface7\n6AUX_CL\nAUX_DAInterrupt \nStatus \nRegisterINT12\nVDDBias & LDO\nGND REGOUT13 18 10FIFO\nConfig \nRegister\nSensor \nRegister\nFactory\nCalibration/CS 8\nSlave I2C \nor SPI \nSerial \nInterface\nCompassSCL\nSDASystem \nProcessor\nInterface \nBypass \nMuxSCL\nSDAVDD\nVDD or GNDI2C Processor Bus: for reading all \nsensor data from MPU and for \nconfiguring external sensors (i.e. \ncompass in this example)\nInterface bypass mux allows \ndirect configuration of \ncompass by system processorOptionalSensor I2C Bus: for \nconfiguring and reading \nfrom external sensors\n  \n \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050 Pro duct Specification  Document Number: PS -MPU -6000A -00 \nRevision: 3.4  \nRelease Date: 08/19/2013  \n \n           29 of 52 7.14 MPU -6000  Using SPI Interface  \nIn the figure below, the system processor is an SPI master to the MPU -6000.  Pins 8, 9, 23, and 24 are used \nto support the /CS, SDO, SCLK, and SDI signals for SPI communications . Because the se SPI pins are \nshared with the I2C slave pins (9, 23 and 24 ), the system processor cannot access the auxiliary  I2C bus \nthrough the interface bypass mu ltiplexer , which connects  the processor I2C interface pins to the sensor I2C \ninterface pins.  \nSince the MPU -6000 has limited capabilities as an I2C Master, and depends on the system processor to \nmanage the initial configuration of any auxiliary sen sors, another method must be used for programming the \nsensors on the auxiliary sensor I2C bus pins 6 and 7 (AUX_DA and AUX_CL).  \nWhen using SPI communications between the MPU -6000 and the system processor, configuration of \ndevices on the auxiliary I2C sensor bus can be achieved by using I2C Slave s 0-4 to perform read and write \ntransactions on any device and register on the auxiliary I2C bus. The I2C Slave 4 interface can be used to \nperform only single byte read and write transactions.  \nOnce the externa l sensors have been  configured, the MPU -6000 can perform single or multi -byte reads \nusing the sensor I2C bus. The read results from the Slave  0-3 controller s can be  written to the FIFO buffer as \nwell as to the external sensor registers.  \nFor further informa tion regarding the control of the MPU -60X0’s auxiliary I2C interfa ce, please refer to the \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050  Register Map and Register Descriptions document.  \nMPU-6000AD0/SDO\nSCL/SCLK\nSDA/SDI\nDigital \nMotion \nProcessor \n(DMP)9\n23\n24\nSensor \nMaster I2C \nSerial \nInterfaceInterrupt \nStatus \nRegisterINT12\nVDDBias & LDO\nGND REGOUT13 18 10FIFO\nConfig \nRegister\nSensor \nRegister\nFactory\nCalibration/CS 8\nSlave I2C \nor SPI \nSerial \nInterfaceSystem \nProcessor\nInterface \nBypass \nMuxSDI\nSCLK\nSDO/CSProcessor SPI Bus: for reading all \ndata from MPU and for configuring \nMPU and external sensors\n7\n6AUX_CL\nAUX_DACompassSCL\nSDAOptional\nI2C Master performs \nread and write \ntransactions on \nSensor I2C bus.Sensor I2C Bus: for \nconfiguring and \nreading data from \nexternal sensors\n \n \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050 Pro duct Specification  Document Number: PS -MPU -6000A -00 \nRevision: 3.4  \nRelease Date: 08/19/2013  \n \n           30 of 52 7.15 Internal Clock Generation  \nThe MPU -60X0  has a flexible clocking scheme, allowing a variety of internal or external clock sources to be \nused for the internal synchronous circuitry.  This synchronous circuitry includes the signal conditioning and \nADCs, the DMP, and various control circuits and re gisters.  An on -chip PLL provides flexibility in the \nallowable inputs for generating this clock.  \nAllowable internal sources for generating the internal clock are:  \n\uf0b7 An internal relaxation oscillator  \n\uf0b7 Any of the X, Y, or Z gyros (MEMS oscillators with a  variat ion of ±1% over temperature)  \n \nAllowable external clocking sources are:  \n\uf0b7 32.768kHz square wave  \n\uf0b7 19.2MHz square wave  \nSelection of the source for generating the internal synchronous clock depends on the availability of external \nsources and the requirements fo r power consumption and clock accuracy.  These requirements w ill most \nlikely vary by mode of operation. For example, in one mode, where the biggest concern is power \nconsumption, the user  may wish to operate the Digital Motion Processor of the MPU -60X0  to process \naccelerometer data, while keeping the gyros off.  In this case, the internal relaxation oscillator is a good clock \nchoice.  However, in another mode, where the gyros are active, selecting the gyros as the clock source \nprovides for  a more accurate cl ock source.  \nClock accuracy is important, since timing errors directly affect the distance and angle calculations performed \nby the Digital Motion Processor ( and by extension, by any processor).   \nThere are also st art-up conditions to consider. When the MPU -60X0  first starts up, the device uses its \ninternal clock  until programmed to operate from another source.  This allows the user, for example, to wait \nfor the MEMS oscillators to stabilize before they are selected as the clock source.  \n \n7.16 Sensor Data Registers   \nThe sensor data registers contain the latest gyro, accelerometer, auxiliary sensor, and temperature \nmeasurement data.  They are read -only registers, and are accessed via the serial interface.  Data from these \nregisters may be read anytime. H owever, the i nterrupt function may be used to determi ne when new data is \navailable.  \nFor a table of interrupt sources  please refer to Section 8.  \n \n7.17 FIFO  \nThe MPU -60X0  contains a 1024 -byte FIFO register that is accessible via the Serial Interface. The FIFO \nconfiguration reg ister determines which  data is written into the FIFO. P ossible choices include  gyro data, \naccelerometer data, temperature readings, auxiliary sensor  readings, and FSYNC input.  A FIFO counter \nkeeps track of how many bytes of valid data are contained in the FIFO. The FIFO register supports burst \nreads.  The interrupt function may be used to determi ne when new data is available.  \nFor further information regarding the F IFO, please refer to the MPU -6000/MPU -6050  Register Map and \nRegister Descriptions document.  \n \n7.18 Interrupts  \nInterrupt functionality is configured via the Interrupt Configuration register. Items that are configurable include \nthe INT pin configuration, the interrupt latching and clearing method, and triggers for the interrupt.  Items that \ncan trigger an interrupt are (1) Clock generator locked to new reference oscillator (used when switching clock \n \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050 Pro duct Specification  Document Number: PS -MPU -6000A -00 \nRevision: 3.4  \nRelease Date: 08/19/2013  \n \n           31 of 52 sources); (2) new data is available to be read (from the FIFO and Data registers); (3) accelerometer event \ninterrupts; and (4) the MPU -60X0 did not receive an acknowledge  from an auxiliary sensor on the secondary \nI2C bus.

Its two inputs are an unregulated VDD of 2.375  to 3.46V and a VLOGIC logic refe rence \nsupply voltage of 1.71V to VDD ( MPU -6050 only).  The  LDO output is bypassed by a capacitor at REGOUT.  \nFor further details on the capacitor, please refer to the Bill of M aterials for External Components (Section \n7.3). \n \n7.21 Charge Pump  \nAn on -board charge p ump generates the high voltage required for the MEMS oscillators.

The master device puts the  slave address on the bus, and the slave device with the \nmatching address acknowledges the master.  \nThe MPU -60X0  always operates as a slave device when communicating to the system proce ssor, which thus \nacts as the master.  SDA and SCL lines typically need pull -up resistors to VDD.  The maximum bus speed is \n400 kHz .  \nThe slave address of the MPU -60X0  is b110100X which is 7 bits long. The LSB bit of the 7 bit address is \ndetermined by the l ogic level on pin AD0. This allows two MPU -60X0 s to be connected to the same I2C bus.  \nWhen used in this configuration, the address of the one of the devices should be b1101000 (pin AD0 is logic \nlow) and the address of the other should be b1101001 (pin AD0  is logic high).  \n \n9.3 I2C Communications Protocol  \nSTART (S) and STOP (P) Conditions  \nCommunication on the I2C bus starts when the master puts the START condition (S) on the bus, which is \ndefined as a HIGH -to-LOW transition of the SDA line while SCL line is HIG H (see figure below).  The bus is \nconsidered to be busy until the master puts a STOP condition (P) on the bus, which is defined as a LOW to \nHIGH transition on the SDA line while SCL is HIGH (see figure below).  \n \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050 Pro duct Specification  Document Number: PS -MPU -6000A -00 \nRevision: 3.4  \nRelease Date: 08/19/2013  \n \n           34 of 52 Additionally, the bus remains busy if a repeat ed START (Sr) is generated instead of a STOP condition.  \nSDA\nSCL\nS\nSTART condition STOP conditionP\n \n \nSTART and STOP Conditions  \n \nData Format / Acknowledge  \nI2C data bytes are defined to be 8 -bits long.  There is no restriction to the number of bytes transmitted per \ndata transfer.  Each byte transferred must be followed by an  acknowledge (ACK) signal.  The clock for the \nacknowledge signal is generated by the master, while the receiver generates  the actual acknowledge signal \nby pulling down SDA and holding it low during the HIGH portion of the acknowledge clock pulse.   \nIf a slave is busy and cannot transmit or receive another byte of data until some other task has been \nperformed, it can hold SCL  LOW, thus forcing the master into a wait state.  Normal data transfer resumes \nwhen the slave is ready, and releases the clock line (refer to the following figure).  \n \n \nDATA OUTPUT BY \nTRANSMITTER (SDA)\nDATA OUTPUT BY \nRECEIVER (SDA)\nSCL FROM \nMASTER\nSTART \nconditionclock pulse for \nacknowledgementacknowledgenot acknowledge\n1 2 8 9\n \nAcknowledge on the I2C Bus  \n \n  \n \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050 Pro duct Specification  Document Number: PS -MPU -6000A -00 \nRevision: 3.4  \nRelease Date: 08/19/2013  \n \n           35 of 52 Communications  \nAfter beginning  communications with the START condition (S), the master sends a 7 -bit slave address \nfollowed by an 8th bit, the read/write bit. The read/write bit indicates whether the master is receiving data from \nor is writing to the slave device. Then, the master rele ases the SDA line and waits for the acknowledge \nsignal (ACK) from the slave device.  Each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge bit.  To \nacknowledge, the slave device pulls the SDA line LOW and keeps it LOW for the hi gh period of the SCL line .  \nData transmission is always terminated by the master  with a STOP condition (P), thus freeing the \ncommunications line.  However, the master can generate a repeated START condition (Sr), and address \nanother slave without first generating a STOP condition (P).  A LOW to HIGH transition on the SDA line while \nSCL is HIGH defines the stop condition. All SDA changes should take place when SCL is low, with the \nexception of start and stop conditions.  \n \nSDA\nSTART \nconditionSCL\nADDRESS R/W ACK DATA ACK DATA ACK STOP \nconditionS P1 – 7 8 9 1 – 7 8 9 1 – 7 8 9\n \nComplete I2C Data Transfer  \n \nTo wr ite the internal MPU -60X0  registers, the master transmits the start condition (S), followed by the I2C \naddress and the write bit (0). At the 9th clock cycle (when the clock is high), the MPU -60X0  acknowledges the \ntransfer. Then the master puts the register  address ( RA) on the bus. After the MPU -60X0 acknowledges the \nreception of the register address, the master puts the register  data onto the bus.  This is followed by the ACK \nsignal, and data transfer may be concluded by the stop condition (P). To write mul tiple bytes after the last \nACK signal, the master can continue outputting data rather than transmitting a stop signal. In this case, the \nMPU -60X0  automatically increments the register address and loads the data to the appropriate register.

Upon receiving the ACK signal from the \nMPU -60X0, the master transmits a start signal followed by the slave address and read bit. As a result, the \nMPU -60X0 sends an ACK signal and the data. The communication  ends with a not acknowledge (NACK) \nsignal and a stop bit from master. The NACK condition is defined such that the SDA line remains high at the \n9th clock cyc le.

The MPU -6000 \nalways operates as a Slave device during standard Master -Slave SPI operation.  \nWith respect to the Master, the Serial Clock output (SCLK), the Serial Data Output (SDO) and the Serial \nData Input (SDI) are shared among the Slave devices. Each SPI slave device requires its own Chip Select \n(/CS) line from the master.  \n/CS goes low (active) at the start of transmission and goes back high (inactive) at the end . Only one /CS line \nis active  at a time, ensuring that only one slave is selected at any given time. The /CS lines of the non -\nselected slave devices are held high, caus ing their SDO lines to remain in a high -impedance (high -z) state \nso that they do not int erfere with any active devices.  \nSPI Operational Features  \n1. Data is delivered MSB first and LSB last  \n2. Data is latched on the rising edge of SCLK  \n3. Data should be transitioned on the falling edge of SCLK  \n4. The maximum frequency of SCLK is 1MHz  \n5. SPI read and write op erations are completed in 16 or more clock cycles (two or more bytes). The \nfirst byte contains the SPI Address, and the following byte(s) contain(s) the SPI data.  The first \nbit of the first byte contains the Read/Write bit and indicates the Read (1) or Wr ite (0) operation. \nThe following 7 bits contain the Register Address.

In addition, gyroscopes sense mechanical stress coming \nfrom the printed circuit board ( PCB). This PCB stress can be  minimized by adhering to certain  design rules:  \nWhen using MEMS gyroscope components in plastic  packages, PCB mounting and assembly can cause \npackage stress . This package stress in turn can  affect the output offset and its value over a wide range of \ntemperatures. This stress is caused by the mismatch between the Coefficient of Linear Thermal Expansi on \n(CTE) of the package material and the PCB. Care must be taken to avoid package stress due to mounting.  \nTraces connected to pads should be as symmetric as possible. Maximizing s ymmetry and balance for pad \nconnection will help component self alignment and  will lead to better control of solder paste reduction after \nreflow.  \nAny material used in the surface mount assembly process of the MEMS gyroscope should be free of \nrestricted RoHS elements or compounds. Pb -free solders should be used for assembly.   \n \n11.4.2  Exposed Die Pad Precautions  \nThe MPU -60X0  has very low active and standby current consumption. The exposed die pad is not required \nfor heat sinking, and should not be soldered to the PCB . Failure to adhere to this rule can  induce  \nperformance changes due to package thermo -mechanical stress. There is no electrical connection between \nthe pad and the CMOS.  \n \n11.4.3  Trace Routing  \nRouting traces or vias under the gyro package such that they run under the exposed die pad is prohibited. \nRouted active signals may harmonical ly couple with the gyro MEMS devices, compromising gyro response. \nThese devices are designed with the drive frequencies as follows: X = 33±3Khz, Y = 30±3Khz, and \nZ=27±3Khz. To avoid harmonic coupling don’t route active signals in non -shielded signal planes  directly \nbelow, or above the gyro package. Note: For best performance, design a ground plane under the e -pad to \nreduce PCB signal noise from the board on which the gyro device is mounted. If the gyro device is stacked \nunder an adjacent PCB board, design a  ground plane directly above the gyro device to shield active signals \nfrom the adjacent PCB board.  \n \n11.4.4  Component Placement  \nDo not place large insertion components such as keyboard or similar buttons, connectors, or shielding boxes \nat a distance of less than 6 mm from the MEMS gyro. Maintain generally accepted industry design practices \nfor component placement near the MPU -60X0  to prevent noise coupling and thermo -mechanical stress.  \n \n11.4.5  PCB Mounting and Cross -Axis Sensitivity  \nOrientation errors of the gyroscope and accelerometer mounted to the printed circuit board can cause cross -\naxis sensitivity in which one gyro or accel responds to rotation or acceleration about another axis , \nrespectively . For example, the X -axis gyroscope may respond to rotation about the Y or  Z axes. The \norientation mounting errors are illustrated in the figure below.  \n \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050 Pro duct Specification  Document Number: PS -MPU -6000A -00 \nRevision: 3.4  \nRelease Date: 08/19/2013  \n \n           44 of 52 \nPackage Gyro & Accel Axes (           ) Relative to PCB Axes (           ) with Orientation Errors (Θ and Φ)  MPU-6000MPU-6050  Φ\nΘ XYZ \nThe t able below shows the cross -axis sensitivity as a percentage of  the gyroscope or accelerometer’s \nsensitivity for a given orientation error , respe ctively . \nCross -Axis Sensitivity vs. Orientation Error  \nOrientation Error  \n (θ or Φ)  Cross -Axis Sensitivity  \n(sinθ or sinΦ) \n0º 0% \n0.5º 0.87%  \n1º 1.75%  \nThe specification s for cross -axis sensitivity in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 include the effect of the die  \norientation error with respect to the package.  \n \n11.4.6  MEMS Handling Instructions  \nMEMS (Micro Electro -Mechanical Systems) are a time -proven, robust technology used in hundreds of \nmillions of consumer, automotive and industrial products. MEMS devices consist of microscopic moving \nmechanical structures. They differ from conventional IC products , even though they can be found in similar \npackages. Therefore, MEMS devices require different handling precautions than conventional ICs prior to \nmounting onto printed circ uit boards (PCBs).  \nThe MPU -60X0  has been qualified to a shock tolerance of 10,000 g. InvenSense packages its gyroscopes as \nit deems proper for protection against normal handling and shipping. It recommends the following handling \nprecautions to prevent poten tial damage.  \n\uf0b7 Do not drop i ndividually packaged gyroscopes, or trays of g yroscopes onto hard surfaces. Components \nplaced in trays could be subject to g-forces in excess of 10,000 g if dropped.  \n\uf0b7 Printed circuit boards that incorporate mounted gyroscopes shoul d not be separated by manually \nsnapping apart. This could also create g-forces in excess of 10,000 g. \n\uf0b7 Do not clean MEMS gyroscopes in ultrasonic baths. Ultrasonic baths can induce MEMS damage if the \nbath energy causes excessive drive motion through resonant  frequency coupling.  \n \n11.4.7  ESD Considerations  \nEstablish and use ESD -safe handling precautions when unpacking and handling ESD -sensitive devices.  \n \nMPU -6000/MPU -6050 Pro duct Specification  Document Number: PS -MPU -6000A -00 \nRevision: 3.4  \nRelease Date: 08/19/2013  \n \n           45 of 52 \uf0b7 Store ESD sensitive devices in ESD safe containers until ready for use.

The best practice is to keep the units in the original moisture \nsealed bags until ready for assembly.  \nRestrict all device handling to ESD protected work areas that measure less than 200V static charge . Ensure \nthat all workstations and personnel are properly grounded to prevent ESD.  \n11.4.8  Reflow Specification  \nQualification Reflow:  The MPU -60X0  was qualified in accord ance with IPC/JEDEC J -STD-020D. 1.
