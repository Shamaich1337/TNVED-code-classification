It complies with ANSI EIA/TIA -485- A and ISO 8482: 1987(E). \nUsing iCoupler ® technology  from Analog Devices, Inc., the \nADM2481 combines a 3 -channel isolator, a three -state diffe -\nrential line driver, and a differential input receiver into a single package. The logic side of the de vice is powered with e ither a \n5 V or 3 V supply, and the bus side uses a 5 V supply only. \nThe ADM2481 is slew -limited to reduce reflections with imp rop-\nerly terminated transmission lines. The controlled slew rate limits the data rate to 500 kbps. The input impedance of the \ndevice is 96 kΩ, allowing up to 256 transceivers on the bus. Its \ndriver has an active -high enable feature. The driver differential \noutputs and receiver differential inputs are connected internally to form a differential input/output ( I/O) port. When the driver  \nis disabled or when V\nDD1 or V DD2 = 0 V , this imposes minimal \nloading on the bus. An active -high receiver disable feature, \nwhich causes the receive r output to enter a high impedance \nstate, is provided as well.   \nThe receiver inputs have a true fail -safe feature that ensures a \nlogic -high receiver output level when the inputs are open or \nshorted. This guarantees that the receiver outputs are in a known state before communication begins and at the point \nwhen communic ation ends.  \nCurrent limiting and thermal shutdown features protect against \noutput short circuits and bus contention situations that might \ncause excessive power dissipation. The part is fully specified over the industrial temperature range  of −40°C to +85°C  and is \navailable in a 16 -lead, wide body SOIC package.  \n \nADM2481 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

B | Page 13 of 17 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nELECTRICAL ISOLATION \nIn the ADM2481, electrical isolation is implemented on the \nlogic side of the interface. Therefore, the part has two main \nsections: a digital isolation section and a transceiver section (see Figure 26). Driver input and data enable signals, applied to the \nTxD and DE pins, respectively, and referenced to logic ground \n(GND\n1), are coupled across an isolation barrier to appear at the \ntransceiver section referenced to isolated ground (GND 2). \nSimilarly, the receiver output, referenced to isolated ground in the transceiver section, is coupled across the isolation barrier  \nto appear at the RxD pin referenced to logic ground (GND\n1).  iCoupler Technology \nThe digital signals are transmitted across the isolation barrier \nusing iCoupler technology. This technique uses chip scale trans-\nformer windings to couple the digital signals magnetically from \none side of the barrier to the other. Digital inputs are encoded into waveforms that are capable of exciting the primary trans-former winding. At the secondary winding, the induced waveforms are then decoded into the binary value that was originally transmitted.  \n \n \n04736-025RETxD DECODE ENCODE\nDE DECODE ENCODE\nRxD ENCODE DECODEISOLATION\nBARRIER\nDIGITAL ISOLATION TRANSCEIVERD\nRAVDD1 VDD2\nGND1 GND2B\n \nFigure 26.

Shorting the driver outputs to a low impedance \nsource can result in high driver currents. The thermal sensing \ncircuitry detect s the increase in die temperature under this \ncondition and disables the driver outputs. This circuitry is \ndesigned to disable the driver outputs when a die temperature of 150°C is reached. As the device cools, the drivers are re- enabled \nat a temperature of  140°C.  TRUE FAIL -SAFE RECEIVER INPUTS  \nThe receiver inputs have a true fail -safe feature that  ensures that \nthe receiver output is high when the inputs are open or shorted. During line -idle conditions, when no driver on the bus is \nenabled, the voltage acro ss a terminating resistance at the \nreceiver input decays to 0 V . With traditional transceivers, receiver input thresholds specified between −200 mV and +200 mV mean that external bias resistors are required on the \nA and B pins to ensure that the receiver o utputs are in a known \nstate. The true fail -safe receiver input feature eliminates the \nneed for bias resistors by specifying the receiver input thresh - \nold between −30 mV and −200 mV . The guaranteed negative threshold means that when the voltage between A a nd B decays \nto 0 V , the receiver output is guaranteed to be high.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD IMMUN ITY \nBecause iCouplers use a coreless technology, no magnetic \ncomponents are present, and the problem of magnetic satura -\ntion of the core material does not exist. Therefor e, iCouplers \nhave essentially infinite dc field immunity. The analysis that follows defines the conditions under which this might occur. The 3 V operating condition  of the ADM2481 is examined \nbecause it represents the most susceptible mode of operation.  \nThe limitation on the ac magnetic field immunity of the \niCoupler is set by the condition in which the induced error \nvoltage in the receiving coil (the bottom coil in this case) is made sufficiently large, either to falsely set or reset the decoder. \nThe voltage induced across the bottom coil is given by  \n;π2\nnrdtdβV ∑\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb−=  N n ,...,2,1=  \nwhere , if the pulses at the transformer output are greater than \n1.0 V in amplitude:  \nβ is the  magnetic flux density (gauss) . \nN is the  number of turns in receiving coil . \nrn is the  radius of nth turn in receiving coil (cm) . \nThe decoder has a sensing threshold of about 0.5 V; therefore, \nthere is a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can be \ntolerated.  \nData Sheet ADM2481 \n \nRev. B | Page 15 of 17 Given the geometry of the receivin g coil and an imposed \nrequirement that the induced voltage is, at most, 50% of the  \n0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable magnetic \nfield is calculated, as shown in Figure 27.  \n100.000\n10.000\n1.000\n0.100\n0.010\n0.001\n1k 10k 100k 1M 10M 100M\nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENC Y (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLO WABLE MAGNETIC\nFLUX DENSIT Y (kGAUSS)\n08920-027 \nFigure 27. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density  \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum al lowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss  induces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the \nsensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. \nSimilarly, if such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse  \nand is the worst -case polarity, it reduces the received pulse from \n>1.0 V to 0.75 V . This is well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold \nof the decoder.  These magnetic flux density values are shown in Figure 28, \nusing more familiar quantities such as maximum allowable \ncurrent flow, at given distances away from the ADM2481 \ntransformers.  \n1000.00\n100.00\n0.101.0010.00\n0.01\n1k 10k 100k 1M 10M 100M\nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENC Y (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLO WABLE CURRENT (kA)DISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 5mm\nDISTANCE = 100mm\n08920-028 \nFigure 28.

Power supply \nbypassing is required at the input and output supply pins (see \nFigure 29).  \nBypass capacitors are most conveniently connected between \nPin 1 and Pin 2 for V DD1 and between Pin 15 and Pin 16 for \nVDD2.

Recommended Printed Circuit Board Layout In applications involving high common-mode transients, take \ncare to ensure that board coupling across the isolation barrier  is minimized. Furthermore, the board layout must be designed such that any coupling that does occur equally affects all pins on a given component side.  \nFailure to ensure this can cause voltage differentials between \npins that exceed the absolute maximum ratings of the device, \nthereby leading to latch-up or permanent damage. \nISOLATED POWER SUPPLY CIRCUIT \nThe ADM2481 requires isolated power capable of 5 V at \n100 mA to be supplied between the V DD2 and GND 2 pins. If  \nno suitable integrated power supply is available, a discrete \ncircuit, such as the one in Figure 30, can be used. A center-tapped transformer provides electrical isolation. The primary \nwinding is excited with a pair of square waveforms that are 180° \nout of phase with each other. A pair of Schottky diodes and a smoothing capacitor are used to create a rectified signal from the secondary winding.
