P/G Package Externally Set Current Limit.\nTOP242-250\n5O\n11/05TOPSwitch-GX  Family Functional \nDescription\nLike TOPSwitch , TOPSwitch-GX is an integrated switched \nmode power supply chip that converts a current at the control \ninput to a duty cycle at the open drain output of a high voltage power MOSFET.  During normal operation the duty cycle of the power MOSFET decreases linearly with increasing \n \nCONTROL pin current as shown in Figure 7. \nIn addition to the three terminal TOPSwitch  features, such as \nthe high voltage start-up, the cycle-by-cycle current limiting, \nloop compensation circuitry, auto-restart, thermal shutdown, \nthe TOPSwitch-GX  incorporates many additional functions that \nreduce system cost, increase power supply performance and design ﬂexibility.  A patented high voltage CMOS technology allows both the high voltage power MOSFET and all the low voltage control circuitry to be cost effectively integrated onto \na single monolithic chip. \nThree terminals, FREQUENCY, LINE-SENSE, and \nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT (available in Y, R or F package) or one terminal MULTI-FUNCTION (available in P or G package) have been added to implement some of the new \n \nfunctions.  These terminals can be connected to the SOURCE pin to operate the TOPSwitch-GX  in a TOPSwitch -like three \nterminal mode. However, even in this three terminal mode, the TOPSwitch-GX  offers many new transparent features that do \nnot require any external components: \n1. A fully integrated 10 ms soft-start limits peak currents \nand voltages during start-up and dramatically reduces or \neliminates output overshoot in most applications. \n2.  DCMAX of 78% allows smaller input storage capacitor, lower \ninput voltage requirement and/or higher power capability.\n3.  Frequency reduction at light loads lowers the switching \nlosses and maintains good cross regulation in multiple output \nsupplies. \n4.  Higher switching frequency of 132 kHz reduces the \ntransformer size with no noticeable impact on EMI. \n5.  Frequency jittering reduces EMI. \n6.  Hysteretic over-temperature shutdown ensures automatic \nrecovery from thermal fault. Large hysteresis prevents \ncircuit board overheating. \n7.  Packages with omitted pins and lead forming provide large \ndrain creepage distance. \n8.  Tighter absolute tolerances and smaller temperature  \nvariations on switching frequency, current limit and PWM gain.\n The LINE-SENSE (L) pin is usually used for line sensing by connecting a resistor from this pin to the rectiﬁed DC high \n \nvoltage bus to implement line overvoltage (OV), under-voltage (UV) and line feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction.  In this  \nmode, the value of the resistor determines the OV/UV thresholds  \nand the DCMAX is reduced linearly starting from a line voltage  \nabove the under-voltage threshold. See Table 2 and Figure 11.The pin can also be used as a remote ON/OFF and a  \nsynchronization input.\nThe EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT (X) pin is usually used \nto reduce the current limit externally to a value close to the operating peak current, by connecting the pin to SOURCE through a resistor.  This pin can also be used as a remote \n \nON/OFF and a synchronization input in both modes. See  \nTable 2 and Figure 11. \nFor the P or G packages the LINE-SENSE and EXTERNAL \nCURRENT LIMIT pin functions are combined on one MULTI-FUNCTION (M) pin. However, some of the functions become mutually exclusive as shown in Table 3.\nThe FREQUENCY (F) pin in the Y , R or F package sets the \nswitching frequency to the default value of 132 kHz when \n \nconnected to SOURCE pin. A half frequency option of  \n66 kHz can be chosen by connecting this pin to CONTROL pin  \ninstead.  Leaving this pin open is not recommended.

Relationship of Duty Cycle and Frequency to CONTROL    Pin Current.\nTOP242-250\nO\n11/056CONTROL (C) Pin Operation\nThe CONTROL pin is a low impedance node that is capable of receiving a combined supply and feedback current. During normal operation, a shunt regulator is used to separate the feedback signal from the supply current.  CONTROL pin voltage \nVC is the supply voltage for the control circuitry including the \nMOSFET gate driver.  An external bypass capacitor closely connected between the CONTROL and SOURCE pins is required to supply the instantaneous gate drive current.  The total amount of capacitance connected to this pin also sets the auto-restart \ntiming as well as control loop compensation. \nWhen rectiﬁed DC high voltage is applied to the DRAIN \npin during start-up, the MOSFET is initially off, and the  \nCONTROL pin capacitor is charged through a switched high voltage current source connected internally between the DRAIN and CONTROL pins. When the CONTROL pin voltage V\nC \nreaches approximately 5.8 V , the control circuitry is activated and the soft-start begins.  The soft-start circuit gradually \n \nincreases the duty cycle of the MOSFET from zero to the maximum value over approximately 10 ms. If no external feedback/supply current is fed into the CONTROL pin by the end of the soft-start, the high voltage current source is turned off and the CONTROL pin will start discharging in response to the supply current drawn by the control circuitry.  If the power supply is designed properly, and no fault condition such as open loop or shorted output exists, the feedback loop will close, providing external CONTROL pin current, before the CONTROL pin voltage has had a chance to discharge to the lower threshold voltage of approximately 4.8 V (internal supply under-voltage lockout threshold). When the externally fed current charges the CONTROL pin to the shunt regulator voltage of 5.8 V , current in excess of the consumption of the chip is shunted to SOURCE through resistor R\nE as shown in  \nFigure 2.  This current ﬂowing through RE controls the duty cycle \nof the power MOSFET to provide closed loop regulation.  The shunt regulator has a ﬁnite low output impedance Z\nC that sets \nthe gain of the error ampliﬁer when used in a primary feedback conﬁguration.  The dynamic impedance Z\nC of the CONTROL \npin together with the external CONTROL pin capacitance sets \nthe dominant pole for the control loop.\nWhen a fault condition such as an open loop or shorted output \nprevents the ﬂow of an external current into the CONTROL pin, the capacitor on the CONTROL pin discharges towards 4.8 V . At 4.8 V , auto-restart is activated which turns the output MOSFET off and puts the control circuitry in a low current standby mode. The high-voltage current source turns on and charges the external capacitance again.  A hysteretic internal supply under-voltage comparator keeps V\nC within a window \nof typically 4.8 V to 5.8 V by turning the high-voltage current source on and off as shown in Figure 8.  The auto-restart \n \ncircuit has a divide-by-eight counter which prevents the output MOSFET from turning on again until eight discharge/charge cycles have elapsed.  This is accomplished by enabling the output MOSFET only when the divide-by-eight counter reaches full count (S7). The counter effectively limits TOPSwitch-GX\n \npower dissipation by reducing the auto-restart duty cycle to typically 4%. Auto-restart mode continues until output \n \nvoltage regulation is again achieved through closure of the  \nfeedback loop.\nOscillator and Switching Frequency\nThe internal oscillator linearly charges and discharges an  \nPI-2545-082299S1 S2 S6 S7 S1 S2 S6 S7 S0 S1 S7S0 S05.8 V\n4.8 VS70 V\n0 V\n0 VVLINE\nVC\nVDRAI N\nVOUT\nNote: S0 through S7 are the output states of the auto-restart counter  2 1 2 3 40 V\n~~~~ ~~ ~~ ~~\nS6 S7~~ ~~ ~~ ~~VUV\n~~\n~~ ~~ ~~S2~~\nFigure 8.

This oscillator sets the pulse width modulator/current limit latch at \nthe beginning of each cycle. \nThe nominal switching frequency of 132 kHz was chosen to \nminimize transformer size while keeping the fundamental EMI frequency below 150 kHz.  The FREQUENCY pin (available only in Y , R or F package), when shorted to the CONTROL pin, lowers the switching frequency to 66 kHz (half frequency) which may be preferable in some cases such as noise sensitive video applications or a high efﬁciency standby mode.  Otherwise, the FREQUENCY pin should be connected to the SOURCE pin \nfor the default 132 kHz. \nTo further reduce the EMI level, the switching frequency is \njittered (frequency modulated) by approximately ±4 kHz at  \n250 Hz (typical) rate as shown in Figure 9.  Figure 46 shows the typical improvement of EMI measurements with frequency jitter.\nPulse Width Modulator and Maximum Duty Cycle\nThe pulse width modulator implements voltage mode control by driving the output MOSFET with a duty cycle inversely proportional to the current into the CONTROL pin\n that \nis in excess of the internal supply current of the chip (see  \nFigure 7).  The excess current is the feedback error signal that appears across R\nE (see Figure 2).  This signal is ﬁltered by an RC  \nnetwork with a typical corner frequency of 7 kHz to reduce the effect of switching noise in the chip supply current generated by the MOSFET gate driver.  The ﬁltered error signal is \n \ncompared with the internal oscillator sawtooth waveform to generate the duty cycle waveform.  As the control current \n \nincreases, the duty cycle decreases.  A clock signal from the oscillator sets a latch which turns on the output MOSFET.  The pulse width modulator resets the latch, turning off the output MOSFET.  Note that a minimum current must be driven into the CONTROL pin before the duty cycle begins to change. \nThe maximum duty cycle, DC\nMAX, is set at a default maximum \nvalue of 78% (typical).  However, by connecting the LINE-  \nSENSE or MULTI-FUNCTION pin (depending on the  \npackage) to the rectiﬁed DC high voltage bus through a  \nresistor with appropriate value, the maximum duty cycle can \nbe made to decrease from 78% to 38% (typical) as shown in Figure 11 when input line voltage increases (see line feed \n \nforward with DCMAX reduction).\nLight Load Frequency ReductionThe pulse width modulator duty cycle reduces as the load at the power supply output decreases.  This reduction in duty cycle is proportional to the current ﬂowing into the CONTROL pin.  As the CONTROL pin current increases, the duty cycle \n \ndecreases linearly towards a duty cycle of 10%. Below 10% duty cycle, to maintain high efﬁciency at light loads, the \n frequency is also reduced linearly until a minimum frequency is reached at a duty cycle of 0% (refer to Figure 7).  The \n \nminimum frequency is typically 30 kHz and 15 kHz for  \n132 kHz and 66 kHz operation, respectively.\nThis feature allows a power supply to operate at lower  \nfrequency at light loads thus lowering the switching losses \nwhile maintaining good cross regulation performance and low  \noutput ripple.  \nError Ampliﬁer\nThe shunt regulator can also perform the function of an error ampliﬁer in primary side feedback applications.  The shunt regulator voltage is accurately derived from a temperature-compensated bandgap reference.  The gain of the error ampliﬁer is set by the CONTROL pin dynamic impedance. The CONTROL pin clamps external circuit signals to the V\nC  \nvoltage level. The CONTROL pin current in excess of the  \nsupply current is separated by the shunt regulator and ﬂows \nthrough RE as a voltage error signal. \nOn-Chip Current Limit with External ProgrammabilityThe cycle-by-cycle peak drain current limit circuit uses the output MOSFET ON-resistance as a sense resistor.  A current limit comparator compares the output MOSFET on-state drain to source voltage, V\nDS(ON) with a threshold voltage.  High drain  \ncurrent causes VDS(ON) to exceed the threshold voltage and turns \nthe output MOSFET off until the start of the next clock cycle.  The current limit comparator threshold voltage is temperature compensated to minimize the variation of the current limit due to temperature related changes in  R\nDS(ON) of the output MOSFET. \nThe default current limit of TOPSwitch-GX  is preset internally.  \nHowever, with a resistor connected between EXTERNAL  \nCURRENT LIMIT (X) pin (Y , R or F package) or MULTI-  \nFUNCTION (M) pin (P or G package) and SOURCE pin,  \ncurrent limit can be programmed externally to a lower level  \nbetween 30% and 100% of the default current limit.  Please refer to the graphs in the typical performance characteristics section for the selection of the resistor value. By setting current limit low, a larger TOPSwitch-GX  than necessary for the power \n PI-2550-092499\n128 kH z\n4 ms\nTimeSwitching\nFrequency\nVDRAIN  136 kH z\nFigure 9. Switching Frequency Jitter (Idealized VDRAIN Waveforms).\nTOP242-250\nO\n11/058required can be used to take advantage of the lower RDS(ON) for  \nhigher efﬁciency/smaller heat sinking requirements. With \na second resistor connected between the EXTERNAL  CURRENT LIMIT (X) pin (Y , R or F package) or MULTI-FUNCTION (M) pin (P or G package) and the rectiﬁed DC high voltage bus, the current limit is reduced with increasing line voltage, allowing a true power limiting operation against line variation to be implemented.  When using an RCD clamp, this power limiting technique reduces maximum clamp \n \nvoltage at high line. This allows for higher reﬂected voltage \ndesigns as well as reducing clamp dissipation. \nThe leading edge blanking circuit inhibits the current limit  \ncomparator for a short time after the output MOSFET is turned \non.  The leading edge blanking time has been set so that, if a power supply is designed properly, current spikes caused by primary-side capacitances and secondary-side rectiﬁer reverse recovery time should not cause premature termination of the \nswitching pulse.\nThe current limit is lower for a short period after the leading \nedge blanking time as shown in Figure 52.  This is due to  \ndynamic characteristics of the MOSFET.  To avoid triggering the current limit in normal operation, the drain current waveform \nshould stay within the envelope shown.\nLine Under-Voltage Detection (UV)\nAt power up, UV keeps TOPSwitch-GX  off until the input line \nvoltage reaches the under-voltage threshold.  At power down, UV prevents auto-restart attempts after the output goes out of regulation.  This eliminates power down glitches caused by slow discharge of the large input storage capacitor present in applications such as standby supplies. A single resistor \n \nconnected from the LINE-SENSE pin (Y , R or F package) or MULTI-FUNCTION pin (P or G package) to the rectiﬁed DC high voltage bus sets UV threshold during power up.  Once the power supply is successfully turned on, the UV threshold is lowered to 40% of the initial UV threshold to allow extended input voltage operating range (UV low threshold).  If the UV low threshold is reached during operation without the power supply losing regulation, the device will turn off and stay off until UV (high threshold) has been reached again.  If the power supply loses regulation before reaching the UV low threshold, the device will enter auto-restart. At the end of each auto-\n \nrestart cycle (S7), the UV comparator is enabled. If the UV high threshold is not exceeded the MOSFET will be disabled during the next cycle (see Figure 8). The UV feature can be disabled independent of the OV feature as shown in \n \nFigures 19 and 23.\nLine Overvoltage Shutdown (OV)The same resistor used for UV also sets an overvoltage threshold which, once exceeded, will force TOPSwitch-GX  output into \noff-state.  The ratio of OV and UV thresholds is preset at 4.5 as can be seen in Figure 11.  When the MOSFET is off, the rectiﬁed DC high voltage surge capability is increased to the voltage rating of the MOSFET (700 V), due to the absence of the reﬂected voltage and leakage spikes on the drain.  A small amount of hysteresis is provided on the OV threshold to \n \nprevent noise triggering. The OV feature can be disabled  \nindependent of the UV feature as shown in Figures 18 and 32.\nLine Feed-Forward with DCMAX Reduction\nThe same resistor used for UV and OV also  implements line \nvoltage feed-forward, which minimizes output line ripple and reduces power supply output sensitivity to line transients.  This feed-forward operation is illustrated in Figure 7 by the \n \ndifferent values of IL (Y , R or F package) or IM (P or G package).  \nNote that for the same CONTROL pin current, higher line \nvoltage results in smaller operating duty cycle.  As an added  \nPI-2637-060600Oscillator\n(SAW)\nDMAX\nEnable from\nX, L or M Pin (STOP)\nTime\nFigure 10. Synchronization Timing Diagram.\nTOP242-250\n9O\n11/05feature, the maximum duty cycle DCMAX is also reduced \nfrom 78% (typical) at a voltage slightly higher than the UV \nthreshold to 30% (typical) at the OV threshold (see Figure 11).  \nLimiting DCMAX at higher line voltages helps prevent transformer \nsaturation due to large load transients in TOP248, TOP249 and TOP250 forward converter applications. DC\nMAX of 38% at \nhigh line was chosen to ensure that the power capability of the  \nTOPSwitch-GX  is not restricted by this feature under normal \noperation.\nRemote ON/OFF and Synchronization\nTOPSwitch-GX  can be turned on or off by controlling the \ncurrent into the LINE-SENSE pin or out from the EXTERNAL  \nCURRENT LIMIT pin (Y , R or F package) and into or out from the MULTI-FUNCTION pin (P or G package) (see \n \nFigure 11).  In addition, the LINE-SENSE pin has a 1 V threshold comparator connected at its input.  This voltage threshold can also be used to perform remote ON/OFF control. This allows easy implementation of remote \n \nON/OFF control of TOPSwitch-GX  in several different ways.  \nA transistor or an optocoupler output connected between the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT or LINE-SENSE pins (Y , R or F package) or the MULTI-FUNCTION pin (P or G package) and the SOURCE pin implements this function with “active-on” (Figures 22, 29 and 36) while a transistor or an optocoupler output connected between the LINE-SENSE pin \n \n(Y , R or F package) or the MULTI-FUNCTION (P or G package) pin and the CONTROL pin implements the function with \n \n“active-off” (Figures 23 and 37). \nWhen a signal is received at the LINE-SENSE pin or the  \nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin (Y , R or F package) or \nthe MULTI-FUNCTION pin (P or G package) to disable the output through any of the pin functions such as OV , UV and remote ON/OFF, TOPSwitch-GX always completes its current \nswitching cycle, as illustrated in Figure 10, before the output is forced off. The internal oscillator is stopped slightly before the end of the current cycle and stays there as long as the disable signal exists.  When the signal at the above pins changes state from disable to enable, the internal oscillator starts the next switching cycle. This approach allows the use of these pins to synchronize TOPSwitch-GX to any external signal with a \n \nfrequency between its internal switching frequency and 20 kHz.\nAs seen above, the remote ON/OFF feature allows the \nTOPSwitch-GX  to be turned on and off instantly, on a cycle-\nby-cycle basis, with very little delay.  However, remote  \nON/OFF can also be used as a standby or power switch to turn off the TOPSwitch-GX  and keep it in a very low power \n \nconsumption state for indeﬁnitely long periods.  If the TOPSwitch-GX  is held in remote off state for long enough \ntime to allow the CONTROL pin to discharge to the internal \n \nsupply under-voltage threshold of 4.8 V (approximately 32 ms for a 47 \nµF CONTROL pin capacitance), the CONTROL pin \ngoes into the hysteretic mode of regulation.  In this mode, the \nCONTROL pin goes through alternate charge and discharge cycles between 4.8 V and 5.8 V (see CONTROL pin operation \nsection above) and runs entirely off the high voltage DC input, but with very low power consumption (160 mW typical at \n \n230 V AC with M or X pins open).  When the TOPSwitch-GX  \nis remotely turned on after entering this mode, it will initiate a normal start-up sequence with soft-start the next time the \n \nCONTROL pin reaches 5.8 V . In the worst case, the delay from remote on to start-up can be equal to the full discharge/charge cycle time of the CONTROL pin, which is approximately \n \n125 ms for a 47 µF CONTROL pin capacitor. This  \nreduced consumption remote off mode can eliminate  \nexpensive and unreliable in-line mechanical switches. It also allows for microprocessor controlled turn-on and turn-off \n \nsequences that may be required in certain applications such as \ninkjet and laser printers.  \nSoft-StartTwo on-chip soft-start functions are activated at start-up with a duration of 10 ms (typical).  Maximum duty cycle starts from 0% and linearly increases to the default maximum of 78% at the end of the 10 ms duration and the current limit starts from about 85% and linearly increases to 100% at the end of the \n \n10 ms duration.  In addition to start-up, soft-start is also  \nactivated at each restart attempt during auto-restart and when restarting after being in hysteretic regulation of CONTROL pin voltage (V\nC), due to remote OFF or thermal shutdown  \nconditions.  This effectively minimizes current and voltage stresses on the output MOSFET, the clamp circuit and the \n \noutput rectiﬁer during start-up.  This feature also helps  \nminimize output overshoot and prevents saturation of the  \ntransformer during start-up.\nShutdown/Auto-RestartTo minimize TOPSwitch-GX  power dissipation under fault \nconditions, the shutdown/auto-restart circuit turns the power supply on and off at an auto-restart duty cycle of typically 4% if an out of regulation condition persists.  Loss of regulation interrupts the external current into the CONTROL pin. V\nC \nregulation changes from shunt mode to the hysteretic auto-restart mode as described in CONTROL pin operation section.  When the fault condition is removed, the power supply output \n \nbecomes regulated, VC regulation returns to shunt mode, and \nnormal operation of the power supply resumes.\nHysteretic Over-Temperature Protection\nTemperature protection is provided by a precision analog  \ncircuit that turns the output MOSFET off when the junction temperature exceeds the thermal shutdown temperature \n \n(140 °C typical).  When the junction temperature cools to  \nbelow the hysteretic temperature, normal operation resumes providing automatic recovery. A large hysteresis of 70 \n°C  \n(typical) is provided to prevent overheating of the PC board due to a continuous fault condition. V\nC is regulated in hysteretic mode \nand a 4.8 V to 5.8 V (typical) sawtooth waveform is present on \nthe CONTROL pin while in thermal shutdown. \nTOP242-250\nO\n11/0510Table 2. Typical LINE-SENSE and EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT Pin Conﬁgurations.Bandgap Reference\nAll critical TOPSwitch-GX  internal voltages are derived from \na temperature-compensated bandgap reference.  This reference  is also used to generate a temperature-compensated current reference, which is trimmed to accurately set the switching \n \nfrequency, MOSFET gate drive current, current limit, and the line OV/UV thresholds.  TOPSwitch-GX  has improved circuitry \nto maintain all of the above critical parameters within very tight \nabsolute and temperature tolerances.\nHigh-Voltage Bias Current Source\nThis current source biases TOPSwitch-GX  from the DRAIN \npin and charges the CONTROL pin external capacitance  \nduring start-up or hysteretic operation.  Hysteretic operation occurs during auto-restart, remote OFF and over-temperature shutdown.  In this mode of operation, the current source is switched on and off with an effective duty cycle of approximately 35%.  This duty cycle is determined by the ratio of CONTROL pin charge (I\nC) and discharge currents \n(ICD1 and ICD2).  This current source is turned off during normal  \noperation when the output MOSFET is switching. The effect of the current source switching will be seen on the DRAIN voltage \nwaveform as small disturbances and is normal.\nUsing Feature Pins\nFREQUENCY (F) Pin OperationThe FREQUENCY pin is a digital input pin available in the  \n \nY , R or F package only. Shorting the FREQUENCY pin to SOURCE pin selects the nominal switching frequency of \n \n132 kHz (Figure 13), which is suited for most applications.  For other cases that may beneﬁt from lower switching \n \nfrequency such as noise sensitive video applications, a  \n66 kHz switching frequency (half frequency) can be selected by  \nshorting the FREQUENCY pin to the CONTROL pin  \n(Figure 14).  In addition, an example circuit shown in Figure 15 may be used to lower the switching frequency from 132 kHz in  \nnormal operation to 66 kHz in standby mode for very low \nstandby power consumption.\nLINE-SENSE (L) Pin Operation (Y, R  and F Packages)\nWhen current is fed into the LINE-SENSE pin, it works as a voltage source of approximately 2.6 V up to a maximum \n \ncurrent of +400 µA (typical).  At +400 µA, this pin turns into \na constant current sink. Refer to Figure 12a.  In addition, a  \ncomparator with a threshold of 1 V is connected at the pin and \nis used to detect when the pin is shorted to the SOURCE pin.\nThere are a total of four functions available through the use of \nthe LINE-SENSE pin: OV , UV , line feed-forward with DCMAX \nreduction, and remote ON/OFF.  Connecting the LINE-SENSE pin to the SOURCE pin disables all four functions.  The LINE-SENSE pin is typically used for line sensing by connecting a resistor from this pin to the rectiﬁed DC high voltage bus to implement OV , UV and DC\nMAX reduction with line voltage. In \nthis mode, the value of the resistor determines the line OV/UV thresholds, and the DC\nMAX is reduced linearly with rectiﬁed DC \nhigh voltage starting from just above the UV threshold.  The pin can also be used as a remote ON/OFF and a synchronization input.  Refer to Table 2 for possible combinations of the functions with example circuits shown in Figure 16 through Figure 40.  A description of speciﬁc functions in terms of the LINE-SENSE pin I/V characteristic is shown in Figure 11 (right hand side). The horizontal axis represents LINE-SENSE pin current with positive polarity indicating currents ﬂowing into the pin.  The meaning of the vertical axes varies with functions.  For those that control the ON/OFF states of the output such as UV , OV and remote ON/OFF, the vertical axis represents the enable/\n \ndisable states of the output.  UV triggers at IUV (+50 µA typical \nwith 30 µA hysteresis) and OV triggers at IOV (+225 µA  \ntypical with 8 µA hysteresis).  Between the UV and OV \nthresholds, the output is enabled.

Line feed-forward with DCMAX reduction lowers  \nmaximum duty cycle from 78% at IL(DC) (+60 µA typical) to \n38% at IOV (+225 µA).  \nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT (X) Pin Operation  \n(Y, R and F Packages)\nWhen current is drawn out of the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin, it works as a voltage source of approximately \n \n1.3 V up to a maximum current of -240 µA (typical). At  \n-240 µA, it turns into a constant current source (refer to  \nFigure 12a).\nThere are two functions available through the use of the  \nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin: external current limit  \nand remote ON/OFF. Connecting the EXTERNAL CURRENT \nLIMIT pin to the SOURCE pin disables the two functions. In high efﬁciency applications, this pin can be used to reduce the current limit externally to a value close to the operating peak current by connecting the pin to the SOURCE pin through a resistor. The pin can also be used for remote ON/OFF. \n \nTable 2 shows several possible combinations using this pin. See  \nFigure 11 for a description of the functions where the horizontal axis (left hand side) represents the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin current.  The meaning of the vertical axes varies with function. For those that control the ON/OFF states of the output such as remote ON/OFF, the vertical axis represents the enable/disable states of the output.  For external current limit, the vertical axis represents the magnitude of the I\nLIMIT.  Please \nsee graphs in the Typical Performance Characteristics section for the current limit programming range and the selection of \n \nappropriate resistor value.\nMULTI-FUNCTION (M) Pin Operation (P and G \nPackages)\nThe LINE-SENSE and EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin functions are combined to a single MULTI-FUNCTION pin for P and G packages.  The comparator with a 1 V threshold at the LINE-SENSE pin is removed in this case as shown in \n \nFigure 2b. All of the other functions are kept intact.  However, since some of the functions require opposite polarity of input current (MULTI-FUNCTION pin), they are mutually exclusive. For example, line sensing features cannot be used simultaneously with external current limit setting.  When current is fed into the MULTI-FUNCTION pin, it works as a voltage source of approximately 2.6 V up to a maximum current of +400 \nµA \n(typical).  At +400 µA, this pin turns into a constant current \nsink.  When current is drawn out of the MULTI-FUNCTION pin, it works as a voltage source of approximately 1.3 V up to a maximum current of -240 \nµA (typical).  At -240 µA, it turns \ninto a constant current source.  Refer to Figure 12b.\nThere are a total of ﬁve functions available through the use \nof the MULTI-FUNCTION pin: OV , UV , line feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction, external current limit and remote \nON/OFF.  A short circuit between the MULTI-FUNCTION pin and SOURCE pin disables all ﬁve functions and forces \n \nTOPSwitch-GX  to operate in a simple three terminal mode \nlike TOPSwitch-II .  The MULTI-FUNCTION pin is typically \nused for line sensing by connecting a resistor from this pin to the rectiﬁed DC high voltage bus to implement OV , UV and \nDCMAX reduction with line voltage.  In this mode, the value \nof the resistor determines the line OV/UV thresholds, and the \nDCMAX is reduced linearly with increasing rectiﬁed DC high \nvoltage starting from just above the UV threshold.  External current limit programming is implemented by connecting the MULTI-FUNCTION pin to the SOURCE pin through a resistor.  However, this function is not necessary in most applications since the internal current limit of the P and G package devices has been reduced, compared to the Y, R and F package devices, to match the thermal dissipation capability of the P and G packages. It is therefore recommended that the MULTI-FUNCTION pin is used for line sensing as described above and not for external current limit reduction. The same pin can also \nTable 3.

This design delivers  \n30 W at 12 V , from an 85 V AC to 265 V AC input, at an ambient of 50 \n°C, in an open frame conﬁguration.  A nominal efﬁciency \nof 80% at full load is achieved using TOP244Y . \nThe current limit is externally set by resistors R1 and R2 to a \nvalue just above the low line operating peak DRAIN current of approximately 70% of the default current limit.  This allows use of a smaller transformer core size and/or higher transformer primary inductance for a given output power, \nreducing TOPSwitch-GX  power dissipation, while at the same \ntime avoiding transformer core saturation during startup and output transient conditions.  The resistors R1 & R2 provide a signal that reduces the current limit with increasing line voltage, which in turn limits the maximum overload power at high input line voltage.  This function in combination with the built-in soft-start feature of TOPSwitch-GX , allows the use of a low cost \nRCD clamp (R3, C3 and D1) with a higher reﬂected voltage, by safely limiting the TOPSwitch-GX  drain voltage, with \n \nadequate margin under worst case conditions. Resistor R4  \nprovides line sensing, setting UV at 100 VDC and OV at  \n450 VDC. The extended maximum duty cycle feature of TOPSwitch-GX  (guaranteed minimum value of 75% vs. 64% \nfor TOPSwitch-II ) allows the use of a smaller input capacitor \n(C1). The extended maximum duty cycle and the higher  \nreﬂected voltage possible with the RCD clamp also permit the use of a higher primary to secondary turns ratio for T1, which reduces the peak reverse voltage experienced by the secondary rectiﬁer D8.  As a result a 60 V Schottky rectiﬁer can be used for up to 15 V outputs, which greatly improves power supply efﬁciency. The frequency reduction feature of the \n \nTOPSwitch-GX  eliminates the need for any dummy loading \nfor regulation at no load and reduces the no-load/standby  \nconsumption of the power supply. Frequency jitter provides improved margin for conducted EMI, meeting the CISPR 22 (FCC B) speciﬁcation.\nOutput regulation is achieved by using a simple Zener sense \ncircuit for low cost.  The output voltage is determined by the Zener diode (VR2) voltage and the voltage drops across the optocoupler (U2) LED and resistor R6. Resistor R8 provides bias current to Zener VR2 for typical regulation of ±5% at the 12 V output level, over line and load and component \n \nvariations. \nA High Efﬁciency, Enclosed, 70 W, Universal Adapter Supply\nThe circuit shown in Figure 42 takes advantage of several of the TOPSwitch-GX  features to reduce cost, power supply size and \nTOP242-250\n21O\n11/05increase efﬁciency.  This design delivers 70 W at 19 V , from an \n85 V AC to 265 V AC input, at an ambient of 40 °C, in a small \nsealed adapter case (4” x 2.15” x 1”). Full load efﬁciency is 85% at 85 V AC rising to 90% at 230 V AC input.\nDue to the thermal environment of a sealed adapter, a TOP249Y \nis used to minimize device dissipation.  Resistors R9 and R10 externally program the current limit level to just above the \n \noperating peak DRAIN current at full load and low line.  This allows the use of a smaller transformer core size without \n \nsaturation during startup or output  load transients.  Resistors R9 and R10 also reduce the current limit with increasing line \n \nvoltage,  limiting the maximum overload power at high input line voltage, removing the need for any protection circuitry on the secondary.  Resistor R11 implements an under-voltage and overvoltage sense as well as providing line feed-forward for \n \nreduced output line frequency ripple.  With resistor R11 set at  \n2 MΩ, the power supply does not start operating until the DC \nrail voltage reaches 100 VDC.  On removal of the AC input, the UV sense prevents the output glitching as C1 discharges, \n \nturning off the TOPSwitch-GX  when the output regulation is \nlost or when the input voltage falls to below 40 V , whichever  \noccurs ﬁrst.  This same value of R11 sets the OV threshold to  \n450 V. If exceeded, for example during a line surge,  \nTOPSwitch-GX  stops switching for the duration of the surge,  \nextending the high voltage withstand to 700 V without device damage. Capacitor C11 has been added in parallel with VR1 to reduce Zener clamp dissipation. With a switching frequency of \n \n132 kHz, a PQ26/20 core can be used to provide 70 W. To  \nmaximize efﬁciency, by reducing winding losses, two output windings are used each with their own dual 100 V Schottky \n \nrectiﬁer (D2 and D3). The frequency reduction feature of the  \nTOPSwitch-GX  eliminates any dummy loading to maintain  \nregulation at no load and reduces the no-load consumption of the power supply to only 520 mW at 230 V AC input. Frequency \n \njittering provides conducted EMI meeting the CISPR 22  \n(FCC B) / EN55022B speciﬁcation, using simple ﬁlter components (C7, L2, L3 and C6), even with the output earth grounded.\nTo regulate the output, an optocoupler (U2) is used with a \n \nsecondary reference sensing the output voltage via a resistor  \ndivider (U3, R4, R5, R6).  Diode D4 and C15 ﬁlter and smooth \nthe output of the bias winding. Capacitor C15 (1 µF) prevents \nthe bias voltage from falling during zero to full load transients.   \nResistor R8 provides ﬁltering of leakage inductance spikes,  \nkeeping the bias voltage constant even at high output loads.   \nResistor R7, C9 and C10 together with C5 and R3 provide \nloop compensation.\nDue to the large primary currents, all the small signal control \ncomponents are connected to a separate source node that is Kelvin connected to the SOURCE pin of the TOPSwitch-GX .  \nFor improved common-mode surge immunity, the bias winding \ncommon returns directly to the DC bulk capacitor (C1).\n19 V \n@ 3.6 A\nTOP249Y\nU1\nU3\nTL431U2\nPC817A\nD L\nS X FCRTN\nL2\n820 µH\n2A\nC6\n0.1 µF\nX2\nF1\n3.15 A85-265 VACBR1\nRS805\n8A 600 V\nL3\n75 µH\n2At°T1C13\n0.33 µF\n400 VC12\n0.022 µF\n400 VC11\n0.01 µF\n400 V\nRT1\n10 Ω\n1.7 A\nPI-2691-042203All resistors 1/8 W 5% unless otherwise stated.J1\nL\n \nNCONTROLCONTROLTOPSwitch-GXC1\n150 µF\n400 VPERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nOutput Power:           70 W\nRegulation:           ± 4%\nEfficiency:           ≥ 84%\nRipple:           ≤ 120 mV pk-pk\nNo Load Consumption:      < 0.52 W @ 230 VAC\nC5\n47 µF\n16 VC3\n820 µF\n25 VL1\n200 µH\nC2\n820 µF\n25 VC14\n0.1 µF\n50 V\nC4\n820 µF\n25 V\nC10\n0.1 µF\n50 VC9\n4.7 nF 50 V\nC8\n0.1 µF\n50 VVR1\nP6KE-\n200D2\nMBR20100C7  2.2 nF\nY1 Safety\nD3\nMBR20100\nD4\n1N4148 R11\n2 MΩ\n1/2 W\nR9\n13 MΩR8\n4.7 ΩR1\n270 Ω\nR2\n1 kΩ R5\n562 Ω\n1%R4\n31.6 kΩ\n1%\nR7\n56 kΩ\nR10\n20.5 kΩR3\n6.8 Ω\nR6\n4.75 kΩ\n1%C15\n1 µF\n50 VD1\nUF4006\nFigure 42. 70 W Power Supply using Current Limit Reduction with Line and Line Sensing for UV and OV .\nTOP242-250\nO\n11/0522A High Efﬁciency, 250 W, 250-380 VDC Input Power Supply\nThe circuit shown in Figure 43 delivers 250 W (48 V @  \n5.2 A) at 84% efﬁciency using a TOP249 from a 250 VDC to  \n380 VDC input.  DC input is shown, as typically at this power level a p.f.c. boost stage would preceed this supply, providing the DC input (C1 is included to provide local decoupling).  Flyback topology is still usable at this power level due to the high output voltage, keeping the secondary peak currents low enough so \nthat the output diode and capacitors are reasonably sized.\nIn this example, the TOP249 is at the upper limit of its power \ncapability and the current limit is set to the internal maximum by connecting the X pin to SOURCE.  However, line sensing is implemented by connecting a 2 M\nΩ resistor from the L pin \nto the DC rail.  If the DC input rail rises above 450 VDC, then  \nTOPSwitch-GX  will stop switching until the voltage returns to \nnormal, preventing device damage.\nDue to the high primary current, a low leakage inductance  \ntransformer is essential.  Therefore, a sandwich winding with \na copper foil secondary was used.  Even with this technique, the leakage inductance energy is beyond the power capability of a simple Zener clamp.  Therefore, R2, R3 and C6 are added in parallel to VR1.  These have been sized such that during normal operation, very little power is dissipated by VR1, the leakage energy instead being dissipated by R2 and R3.  \n However, VR1 is essential to limit the peak drain voltage  \nduring start-up and/or overload conditions to below the 700 V \nrating of the TOPSwitch-GX  MOSFET.\nThe secondary is rectifed and smoothed by D2 and C9, C10 and C11.  Three capacitors are used to meet the secondary ripple current requirement.  Inductor L2 and C12 provide switching noise ﬁltering.\nA simple Zener sensing chain regulates the output voltage.  \nThe sum of the voltage drop of VR2, VR3 and VR4 plus the LED drop of U2 gives the desired output voltage. Resistor R6 \n \nlimits LED current and sets overall control loop DC gain.   \nDiode D4 and C14 provide secondary soft-ﬁnish, feeding  \ncurrent into the CONTROL pin prior to output regulation and thus ensuring that the output voltage reaches regulation at start-up under low line, full load conditions.  Resistor R9 provides a discharge path for C14.  Capacitor C13 and R8 provide control loop compensation and are required due to the gain associated \nwith such a high output voltage.\nSufﬁcient heat sinking is required to keep the TOPSwitch-GX  \ndevice below 110 °C when operating under full load, low line \nand maximum ambient temperature.  Airﬂow may also be  \nrequired if a large heatsink area is not acceptable.\n48 V@\n5.2 A+250-380\nVDC\n0 VL D\nS X FCRTN\nPI-2692-081204All resistor 1/8 W 5% unless \notherwise stated.CONTROLTOPSwitch-GXC1\n22 µF\n400 V\nC3\n0.1 µF\n50 VR4\n6.8 ΩR6\n100 Ω\nR8\n56 ΩR9\n10 kΩ\nC3\n47 µF\n10 VC6\n4.7 nF\n1 kV\nC13\n150 nF\n63 VC4\n1 µF\n50 V\nC14\n22 µF\n63 VC9\n560 µF\n63 VC10\n560 µF\n63 VC11\n560 µF\n63 V\nC12\n68 µF\n63 VC7\n2.2 nF Y1\nL2\n3 µH 8AD2\nMUR1640CT\nD2\n1N4148 U2\nLTV817AD1\nBYV26C\nT1R1\n2 MΩ\n1/2 WR3\n68 kΩ\n2 WR2\n68 kΩ\n2 WVR1\nP6KE200\nVR2 22 V\nBZX79B22\nVR3 12 V\nBZX79B12\nVR4 12 V\nBZX79B12CONTROLD4\n1N4148PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nOutput Power:      250 W\nLine Regulation:       ± 1%\nLoad Regulation:      ± 5%\nEfficiency:            ≥ 85%\nRipple:        < 100 mV pk-pk\nNo Load Consumption:     ≤ 1.4 W (300 VDC)TOP249Y\nU1\nFigure 43. 250 W, 48 V Power Supply using TOP249.\nTOP242-250\n23O\n11/05Multiple Output, 60 W, 185-265 V AC Input Power Supply\nFigure 44 shows a multiple output supply typical for high end set-top boxes or cable decoders containing high capacity hard disks for recording. The supply delivers an output power of \n \n45 W continuous/60 W peak (thermally limited) from an input  \nvoltage of 185 VAC to 265 VAC.  Efﬁciency at 45 W,  \n185 V AC is ≥ 75%.\nThe 3.3 V and 5 V outputs are regulated to ±5% without \nthe need for secondary linear regulators. DC stacking (the  \nsecondary winding reference for the other output voltages is connected to the cathode of D10 rather than the anode) is used to minimize the voltage error for the higher voltage outputs.  \nDue to the high ambient operating temperature requirement \ntypical of a set-top box (60 \n°C), the TOP246Y is used to  \nreduce conduction losses and minimize heatsink size.   Resistor R2 sets the device current limit to 80% of typical to limit overload power.  The line sense resistor (R1) protects the TOPSwitch-GX  from line surges and transients by sensing when \nthe DC rail voltage rises to above 450 V . In this condition the \n \nTOPSwitch-GX  stops switching, extending the input voltage \nwithstand to 496 V AC, which is ideal for countries with poor power quality. A thermistor (RT1) is used to prevent \n \npremature failure of the fuse by limiting the inrush current (due to the relatively large size of C2). An optional MOV (RV1)  \nextends the differential surge protection to 6 kV from 4 kV .\nLeakage inductance clamping is provided by VR1, R5 and C5, \nkeeping the DRAIN voltage below 700 V under all conditions.  Resistor R5 and capacitor C5 are selected such that VR1 \n \ndissipates very little power except during overload conditions.  The frequency jittering feature of TOPSwitch-GX  allows the \ncircuit shown to meet CISPR22B with simple EMI ﬁltering \n(C1, L1 and C6) and the output grounded.\nThe secondaries are rectiﬁed and smoothed by D7 to D11, C7, \nC9, C11, C13, C14, C16 and C17.  Diode D11 for the 3.3 V output is a Schottky diode to maximize efﬁciency.  Diode D10 for the 5 V output is a PN type to center the 5 V output at 5 V .  The 3.3 V and 5 V output require two capacitors in parallel to meet the ripple current requirement.  Switching noise ﬁltering is provided by L2 to L5 and C8, C10, C12, C15 and C18.  \n \nResistor R6 prevents peak charging of the lightly loaded 30 V output.  The outputs are regulated using a secondary reference (U3).  Both the 3.3 V and 5 V outputs are sensed via R11 and R10.  Resistor R8 provides bias for U3 and R7 sets the overall DC gain. Resistor R9, C19, R3 and C5 provide loop compensation. A soft-ﬁnish capacitor (C20) eliminates output \n \novershoot.\nFigure 44. 60 W Multiple Output Power Supply using TOP246.D6\n1N4148D7\nUF4003\nD8\nUF5402\nD9\nUF5402\nD11\nMBR1045D10BYV32-200\nT1 U2\nLTV817\nU3\nTL431C20\n22 µF\n10 VR7\n150 Ω\nR12\n10 kC19\n0.1 µFR11\n9.53 \nkΩR10\n15.0 \nkΩ\nR9\n3.3 kΩR8\n1 kΩC6\n2.2 nF\nY1C7\n47 µF\n50 V\nC9\n330 µF\n25 V\nC11\n390 µF\n35 V\nC14 \n1000 µF\n25 V30 V @      0.03 A\n18 V @      0.5 A\n12 V @      0.6 A\n5 V @      3.2 A\n3.3 V @      3 A\nRTND1-D4\n1N4007 V\nF1\n3.15 ARV1\n275 V\n14 mm\nJ1L1\n20 mH\n0.8A\nt°\nL\n \nNR3\n6.8 Ω\nC5\n47 µF\n10 VTOP246Y\nU1D L\nSCTOPSwitch-GXR1\n2 MΩ\n1/2 WR5\n68 kΩ\n2 WR6\n10 Ω\nRT1\n10 Ω\n1.7 AC2\n68 µF\n400 VC5\n1 nF\n400 V\nC3\n1 µF\n50 V\nC1\n0.1 µF\nX1\nPI-2693-081704CONTROLCONTROL\nC3\n0.1 µF\n50 V X FD6\n1N4937VR1\nP6KE170C16 \n1000 µF\n25 VC13 \n1000 µF\n25 V\nC17 \n1000 µF\n25 VC15 \n220 µF\n16 V\nC18 \n220 µF\n16 VC12 \n100 µF\n25 VC10 \n100 µF\n25 VC8 \n10 µF\n50 VL2 \n3.3 µH\n3A\nL3 \n3.3 µH\n3A\nL4 \n3.3 µH\n5A\nL5 \n3.3 µH\n5APERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nOutput Power:       45 W Cont./60 W Peak\nRegulation: \n     3.3 V:        ± 5%\n     5 V:           ± 5%\n     12 V:         ± 7%\n     18 V:         ± 7%\n     30 V:         ± 8%\nEfficiency:   ≥75%\nNo Load Consumption: 0.6 W185-265 VA CR2\n9.08 kΩ\nTOP242-250\nO\n11/0524Processor Controlled Supply Turn On/Off\nA low cost momentary contact switch can be used to turn the  TOPSwitch-GX  power on and off under microprocessor \n \ncontrol, which may be required in some applications such as  \nprinters.  The low power remote OFF feature allows an elegant implementation of this function with very few external \n \ncomponents, as shown in Figure 45.  Whenever the push button momentary contact switch P1 is closed by the user, the optocoupler U3 is activated to inform the microprocessor of this action.  Initially, when the power supply is off (M pin is ﬂoating), closing of P1 turns the power supply on by shorting the M pin of the TOPSwitch-GX  to SOURCE through a diode \n(remote ON).  When the secondary output voltage V\nCC is  \nestablished, the microprocessor comes alive and recognizes that the switch P1 is closed through the switch status input that is driven by the optocoupler U3 output.  The microprocessor then sends a power supply control signal to hold the power supply in the on-state through the optocoupler U4.  If the user presses the switch P1 again to command a turn off, the microprocessor detects this through the optocoupler U3 and initiates a shutdown procedure that is product speciﬁc.  For example, in the case of the inkjet printer, the shutdown procedure may include safely parking the print heads in the storage position.  In the case of products with a disk drive, the shutdown procedure may include saving data or settings to the disk.  After the shutdown procedure is complete, when it is safe to turn off the power supply, the microprocessor releases the M pin by turning the optocoupler U4 off. If the manual switch and the optocouplers U3 and U4 are not located close to the M pin, a capacitor C\nM may be needed \nto prevent noise coupling to the pin when it is open.\nThe power supply could also be turned on remotely through \na local area network or a parallel or serial port by driving the optocoupler U4 input LED with a logic signal.  Sometimes it is easier to send a train of logic pulses through a cable (due to AC coupling of cable, for example) instead of a DC logic level as a wake up signal.  In this case, a simple RC ﬁlter can be used to generate a DC level to drive U4 (not shown in Figure 45).  This remote on feature can be used to wake up peripherals such as printers, scanners, external modems, disk drives, etc., as needed from a computer.  Peripherals are usually designed to turn off automatically if they are not being used for a period of time, to save power.\nU1U2\nU4\nU3\nCM\nP1 P1 Switch \nStatusPower\nSupply\nON/OFF\nControlExternal\nWake-up\nSignal\nPI-2561-030805VCC\n(+5 V)\nRETURNCONTROLMICRO-\nPROCESSOR/ \nCONTROLLER\nLOGIC\nINPUTLOGIC\nOUTPUTHigh V oltage\nDC Input\nTOPSwitch-GX D M\nS FC1N4148\nU4\nLTV817A6.8 kΩ\n1 nF100 kΩ\n6.8 kΩ\nU3\nLTV817A27 kΩ\n1N4148\n47 µF+\nFigure 45. Remote ON/OFF using Microcontroller.\nTOP242-250\n25O\n11/05In addition to using a minimum number of components, \nTOPSwitch-GX  provides many technical advantages in this \ntype of application:\n1. Extremely low power consumption in the off mode: 80 mW \ntypical at 110 V AC and 160 mW typical at 230 V AC.  This \nis because, in the remote OFF mode, the TOPSwitch-GX  \nconsumes very little power and the external circuitry does not consume any current (either M, L or X pin is open) from \nthe high voltage DC input.\n2. A very low cost, low voltage/current, momentary contact \nswitch can be used.\n3. No debouncing circuitry for the momentary switch is \nrequired. During turn-on, the start-up time of the power supply (typically 10 ms to 20 ms) plus the microprocessor initiation time act as a debouncing ﬁlter, allowing a turn-on only if the switch is depressed ﬁrmly for at least the above delay time. During turn-off, the microprocessor initiates the shutdown sequence when it detects the ﬁrst closure of the switch and subsequent bouncing of the switch has no effect.  If necessary, the microprocessor could implement the switch debouncing in software during turn-off, or a ﬁlter \ncapacitor can be used at the switch status input.\n4. No external current limiting circuitry is needed for the \noperation of the U4 optocoupler output due to internal \nlimiting of M pin current.\n5. No high voltage resistors to the input DC voltage rail are \nrequired to power the external circuitry in the primary.  Even the LED current for U3 can be derived from the CONTROL pin.  This not only saves components and simpliﬁes layout, but also eliminates the power loss associated with the high \nvoltage resistors in both ON and OFF states.\n6. Robust design: There is no ON/OFF latch that can be \naccidentally triggered by transients. Instead, the power supply is held in the ON-state through the secondary-side microprocessor. \nTOP242-250\nO\n11/0526Function TOPSwitch-II TOPSwitch-GX FiguresTOPSwitch-GX   \nAdvantages\nSoft-Start N/A*  10 ms • Limits peak current and voltage  \n   component stresses during start- \n  up \n• Eliminates external components  \n  used for soft-start in most  \n  applications  \n• Reduces or eliminates output                               overshoot\nExternal Current  \nLimitN/A* Programmable 100% \nto 30% of default  \ncurrent limit11,20,21,  \n24,25,27,  \n28,34,35,  \n38,39• Smaller transformer  \n• Higher efﬁciency  \n• Allows power limiting (constant    overload power independent of \n \n  line voltage)  \n• Allows use of larger device for     lower losses, higher efﬁciency \n \n  and smaller heatsink\nDCMAX67% 78% 7 • Smaller input cap (wider dynamic            range)\n \n• Higher power capability (when       used with RCD clamp for large    V\nOR) \n• Allows use of Schottky secondary   rectiﬁer diode for up to 15 V \n \n output for high efﬁciency\nLine Feed-Forward \nwith DC MAX ReductionN/A* 78% to 38% 7,11,17,  \n26,27,28,  \n31,40• Rejects line ripple\nLine OV Shutdown N/A* Single resistor  \nprogrammable11,17,19,  \n26,27,28  \n31,33,40• Increases voltage withstand  \n  capability against line surge\nLine UV Detection N/A* Single resistor  \nprogrammable11,17,18,  \n26,27,28,  \n31,32,40• Prevents auto-restart glitches  \n  during power down\nSwitching Frequency 100 kHz ±10% 132 kHz ±6% 13,15 • Smaller transformer  \n• Below start of conducted EMI       limits\nTable 4.

Many of the new \nfeatures eliminate the need for additional discrete components. Other features increase the robustness of design, allowing cost \nsavings in the transformer and other power components.\nTOPSwitch-GX  Design Considerations \nPower TableData sheet power table (Table 1) represents the maximum practical continuous output power based on the following conditions: TOP242 to TOP246: 12 V output, Schottky output diode, 150 V reﬂected voltage (V\nOR) and efﬁciency estimates \nfrom curves contained in application note AN-29. TOP247 to TOP250: Higher output voltages, with a maximum output current of 6 A.\nFor all devices, a 100 VDC minimum for 85-265 V AC and \n \n250 VDC minimum for 230 V AC are assumed and sufﬁcient \nheat sinking to keep device temperature ≤100 °C. Power  \nlevels shown in the power table for the R package device  \nassume 6.45 cm2 of 610 g/m2 copper heat sink area in an  \nenclosed adapter, or 19.4 cm2 in an open frame.  \nTOPSwitch-GX  Selection\nSelecting the optimum TOPSwitch -GX depends upon required \nmaximum output power, efﬁciency, heat sinking constraints and cost goals. With the option to externally reduce current limit, a larger TOPSwitch\n-GX may be used for lower power \napplications where higher efﬁciency is needed or minimal heat \nsinking is available.Table 5. Comparison Between TOPSwitch-FX and TOPSwitch-GX. *Not available   \nTOP242-250\n29O\n11/05Input Capacitor\nThe input capacitor must be chosen to provide the minimum  DC voltage required for the TOPSwitch\n-GX converter to maintain \nregulation at the lowest speciﬁed input voltage and maximum output power.  Since TOPSwitch\n-GX has a higher DCMAX than \nTOPSwitch-II , it is possible to use a smaller input capacitor.   \nFor TOPSwitch -GX, a capacitance of 2 µF per watt is possible for \nuniversal input with an appropriately designed transformer.\nPrimary Clamp and Output Reﬂected Voltage VOR\nA primary clamp is necessary to limit the peak TOPSwitch -GX \ndrain to source voltage.  A Zener clamp requires few parts and \ntakes up little board space.  For good efﬁciency, the clamp Zener should be selected to be at least 1.5 times the output reﬂected voltage V\nOR, as this keeps the leakage spike conduction \ntime short.  When using a Zener clamp in a universal input application, a V\nOR of less than 135 V is recommended to allow \nfor the absolute tolerances and temperature variations of the Zener.  This will ensure efﬁcient operation of the clamp circuit and will also keep the maximum drain voltage below the rated \nbreakdown voltage of the TOPSwitch -GX MOSFET.\nA high VOR is required to take full advantage of the wider DCMAX \nof TOPSwitch -GX. An RCD clamp provides tighter clamp  \nvoltage tolerance than a Zener clamp and allows a VOR as high \nas 150 V .  RCD clamp dissipation can be minimized by reducing the external current limit as a function of input line voltage (see Figures 21 and 35).  The RCD clamp is more cost effective than the Zener clamp but requires more careful design (see Quick \n \nDesign Checklist). \nOutput DiodeThe output diode is selected for peak inverse voltage, output \n \ncurrent, and thermal conditions in the application (including heatsinking, air circulation, etc.). The higher DC\nMAX of \nTOPSwitch -GX, along with an appropriate transformer turns \nratio, can allow the use of a 60 V Schottky diode for higher efﬁciency on output voltages as high as 15 V (see Figure 41:  A \n \n12 V , 30 W design using a 60 V Schottky for the output diode).\nBias Winding Capacitor\nDue to the low frequency operation at no-load a 1 µF bias  \nwinding capacitor is recommended.\nSoft-StartGenerally, a power supply experiences maximum stress at \n \nstart-up before the feedback loop achieves regulation. For a  \nperiod of 10 ms, the on-chip soft-start linearly increases the duty cycle from zero to the default DC\nMAX at turn on. In addition, \nthe primary current limit increases from 85% to 100% over the same period.  This causes the output voltage to rise in an orderly \n \nmanner, allowing time for the feedback loop to take control of the duty cycle.  This reduces the stress on the TOPSwitch-GX \nMOSFET, clamp circuit and output diode(s), and helps prevent transformer saturation during start-up.  Also, soft-start limits the amount of output voltage overshoot and, in many applications, eliminates the need for a soft-ﬁnish capacitor.\nEMI The frequency jitter feature modulates the switching frequency over a narrow band as a means to reduce conducted EMI peaks associated with the harmonics of the fundamental switching \n \nfrequency.  This is particularly beneﬁcial for average detection mode.  As can be seen in Figure 46, the beneﬁts of jitter increase with the order of the switching harmonic due to an increase in \nfrequency deviation.\nThe FREQUENCY pin of TOPSwitch -GX offers a switching  \nfrequency option of 132 kHz or 66 kHz.

TOPSwitch-GX Full Range EMI Scan (132 kHz, With      Jitter) with Identical Circuitry and Conditions.\n  \nTOP242-250\nO\n11/0530frequency radiated noise (for example, video noise sensitive  \napplications such as VCR, DVD, monitor, TV , etc.), operating \nat 66 kHz will reduce snubber loss resulting in better efﬁciency.  Also, in applications where transformer size is not a concern, use of the 66 kHz option will provide lower EMI and higher \n \nefﬁciency.  Note that the second harmonic of 66 kHz is still  \nbelow 150 kHz, above which the conducted EMI speciﬁcations get much tighter. \nFor 10 W or below, it is possible to use a simple inductor in \n \nplace of a more costly AC input common mode choke to meet \nworldwide conducted EMI limits.Transformer Design\nIt is recommended that the transformer be designed for \n \nmaximum operating ﬂux density of 3000 Gauss and a peak ﬂux density of 4200 Gauss at maximum current limit.  The turns ratio should be chosen for a reﬂected voltage (V\nOR) no greater than \n135 V when using a Zener clamp, or 150 V (max) when using an RCD clamp with current limit reduction with line voltage \n \n(overload protection).\nFor designs where operating current is signiﬁcantly lower than \nthe default current limit, it is recommended to use an externally set current limit close to the operating peak current to reduce peak ﬂux density and peak power (see Figures 20 and 34). In most applications, the tighter current limit tolerance, higher switching frequency and soft-start features of TOPSwitch-GX \ncontribute \nto a smaller transformer when compared to TOPSwitch-II.  \nStandby ConsumptionFrequency reduction can signiﬁcantly reduce power loss at light or no load, especially when a Zener clamp is used.  For very low secondary power consumption, use a TL431 regulator for feedback control. Alternately, switching losses can be \n \nsigniﬁcantly reduced by changing from 132 kHz in normal \noperation to 66 kHz under light load conditions.\nTOPSwitch-GX Layout Considerations\nAs TOPSwitch-GX has additional pins and operates at \nmuch higher power levels compared to previous TOPSwitch   \nfamilies, the following guidelines should be carefully  \nfollowed.\nPrimary Side ConnectionsUse a single point (Kelvin) connection at the negative terminal of the input ﬁlter capacitor for the TOPSwitch-GX  SOURCE \npin and bias winding return. This improves surge capabilities by returning surge currents from the bias winding directly to the input ﬁlter capacitor.\nThe CONTROL pin bypass capacitor should be located as \n \nclose as possible to the SOURCE and CONTROL pins and its SOURCE connection trace should not be shared by the main \nMOSFET switching currents. All SOURCE pin referenced components connected to the MULTI-FUNCTION, LINE-SENSE or EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pins should also be located closely between their respective pin and SOURCE.  Once again, the SOURCE connection trace of these \n \ncomponents should not be shared by the main MOSFET  \nswitching currents. It is very critical that SOURCE pin  \nswitching currents are returned to the input capacitor negative terminal through a seperate trace that is not shared by the \n \ncomponents connected to CONTROL, MULTI-FUNCTION, LINE-SENSE or EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pins.  This is because the SOURCE pin is also the controller ground \n \nreference pin.  \nAny traces to the M, L or X pins should be kept as short as \npossible and away from the DRAIN trace to prevent noise  \ncoupling. LINE-SENSE resistor (R1 in Figures 47-49) should be located close to the M or L pin to minimize the trace length on the M or L pin side.\nIn addition to the 47 \nµF CONTROL pin capacitor, a high  \nfrequency bypass capacitor in parallel may be used for better \nnoise immunity.  The feedback optocoupler output should also be located close to the CONTROL and SOURCE pins of TOPSwitch-GX.\nY-Capacitor\nThe Y-capacitor should be connected close to the secondary output return pin(s) and the positive primary DC input pin of the transformer.\nHeat SinkingThe tab of the Y package (TO-220) or F package (TO-262) is internally electrically tied to the SOURCE pin. To avoid circulating currents, a heat sink attached to the tab should not be electrically tied to any primary ground/source nodes on the \nPC board.\nWhen using a P (DIP-8), G (SMD-8) or R (TO-263) package, \na copper area underneath the package connected to the SOURCE pins will act as an effective heat sink. On double sided boards (Figure 49), top side and bottom side areas \n \nconnected with vias can be used to increase the effective heat \nsinking area.  \nIn addition, sufﬁcient copper area should be provided at \nthe anode and cathode leads of the output diode(s) for heat  \nsinking.\nIn Figures 47, 48 and 49, a narrow trace is shown between \nthe output rectiﬁer and output ﬁlter capacitor. This trace acts as a thermal relief between the rectiﬁer and ﬁlter capacitor to \n \nprevent excessive heating of the capacitor. \nTOP242-250\n31O\n11/05TOP VIEW\nPI-2670-042301Y1-Capacitor\nOpto-\ncouplerD+\n-HV\nR2+ -DC\nOutInput Filter CapacitorOutput Filter CapacitorOutput RectifierSafety Spacing\nT\nr\na\nn\ns\nf\no\nr\nm\ne\nrMaximize hatched copper \nareas (            ) for optimum \nheat sinking\nSPRI\nPRISEC\nSS\nSCBIASBIAS\nM\nR1TOPSwitch-GX\nFigure 47.

Layout Consideratiions for TOPSwitch-GX using Y or F Package.\nTOP242-250\nO\n11/0532Quick Design Checklist\nAs with any power supply design, all TOPSwitch-GX  designs \nshould be veriﬁed on the bench to make sure that components \nspeciﬁcations are not exceeded under worst case conditions. The \nfollowing minimum set of tests is strongly recommended:\n1. Maximum drain voltage – Verify that peak VDS does not \nexceed 675 V at highest input voltage and maximum \noverload output power. Maximum overload output power  \noccurs when the output is overloaded to a level just before the \npower supply goes into auto-restart (loss of regulation).\n2. Maximum drain current – At maximum ambient temperature, \nmaximum input voltage and maximum output load, verify drain current waveforms at start-up for any signs of transformer saturation and excessive leading edge current \nspikes.  TOPSwitch-GX  has a leading edge blanking time of \n220 ns to prevent premature termination of the ON-cycle.Verify that the leading edge current spike is below the \n \nallowed current limit envelope (see Figure 52) for the drain current waveform at the end of the 220 ns blanking \nperiod.3. Thermal check – At maximum output power, minimum  \ninput voltage and maximum ambient temperature, verify that temperature specifications are not exceeded for TOPSwitch-GX , transformer, output diodes and output \n \ncapacitors.  Enough thermal margin should be allowed for \nthe part-to-part variation of the RDS(ON)  of TOPSwitch-GX,  \nas speciﬁed in the data sheet.  The margin required can  \neither be calculated from the tolerances or it can be  \naccounted for by connecting an external resistance in  \nseries with the DRAIN pin and attached to the same \nheatsink, having a resistance value that is equal to the  \ndifference between the measured RDS(ON) of the device  \nunder test and the worst case maximum speciﬁcation.\nDesign Tools\nFor a discussion on utilizing TOP248, TOP249 and TOP250 \nin forward converter conﬁgurations, please refer to the TOPSwitch-GX Forward Design Methodology Application \nNote.\nUp-to-date information on design tools can be found at the \nPower Integrations website: www.powerint.com-HV\n+-DC\nOut\nPI-2734-043001T\nr\na\nn\ns\nf\no\nr\nm\ne\nrSafety Spacing\nY1-\nCapacitorSolder Side\nComponent Side\nOpto-\ncoupler+Output Filter Capacitors\nMaximize hatched copper \nareas (           ) for optimum heat sinkingTOP VIEW\nInput Filter \nCapacito r\nR1a - 1cPRI\nPRISEC\nBIAS\nTOPSwitch-GXS\nL\nCXD\nFigure 49.

It is possible to start up and operate TOPSwitch-GX  at DRAIN voltages well below 36 V.  However, the CONTROL  \n pin charging current is reduced, which affects start-up time, auto-restart frequency, and auto-restart duty cycle.   \n Refer to Figure 68, the characteristic graph on CONTROL pin charge current (IC) vs. DRAIN voltage for low   \n voltage operation characteristics.Parameter SymbolConditions  \nSOURCE = 0 V; TJ = -40 to 125 °C  \nSee Figure 53  \n(Unless Otherwise Speciﬁed)Min Typ Max Units\nOUTPUT (cont.)\nON-State  \nResistanceRDS(ON)TOP249  \nID = 600 mATJ = 25 °C 1.30 1.50\nΩTJ = 100 °C 2.15 2.50\nTOP250  \nID = 700 mATJ = 25 °C 1.10 1.28\nTJ = 100 °C 1.85 2.15\nOFF-State Drain \nLeakage CurrentIDSSVL, VM = Floating; IC = 4 mA  \nVDS = 560 V; TJ = 125 °C470 µA\nBreakdown  \nVoltageBVDSSVL, VM = Floating; IC = 4 mA  \nSee Note D, TJ = 25 °C700 V\nRise Time tR Measured in a Typical Flyback  \nConverter Application100 ns\nFall Time tF50 ns\nSUPPLY VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS\nDRAIN Supply VoltageSee Note E 36 V\nShunt Regulator VoltageVC(SHUNT)IC = 4 mA 5.60 5.85 6.10 V\nShunt Regulator Temperature Drift±50 ppm/°C\nControl Supply/\nDischarge CurrentICD1Output MOSFET  \nEnabled  \nVX, VL, VM = 0 VTOP242-245 1.0 1.6 2.5\nmATOP246-249 1.2 2.2 3.2\nTOP250 1.3 2.4 3.65\nICD2Output MOSFET  \nDisabled  \nVX, VL, VM = 0 V0.3 0.6 1.3\nTOP242-250\n39O\n11/05PI-2039-033001DRAIN\nVOLTAGEHV\n0 V90%\n10%90%t2\nt1\nD = t1\nt2\nFigure 50.

Current Limit vs. X or M Pin Current (see Figures 55a and 56a for TOP245P/G and TOP246P/G).The following precautions should be followed when testing \nTOPSwitch-GX  by itself outside of a power supply. The \nschematic shown in Figure 53 is suggested for laboratory testing \nof TOPSwitch-GX.\nWhen the DRAIN pin supply is turned on, the part will be \nin the auto-restart mode. The CONTROL pin voltage will be oscillating at a low frequency between 4.8 V and 5.8 V and the drain is turned on every eigth cycle of the CONTROL pin oscillation. If the CONTROL pin power supply is turned on while in this auto-restart mode, there is only a 12.5% chance that the CONTROL pin oscillation will be in the correct state (drain active state) so that the continuous drain voltage waveform may be observed. It is recommended that the V\nC power supply \nbe turned on ﬁrst and the DRAIN pin power supply second if continuous drain voltage waveforms are to be observed. The 12.5% chance of being in the correct state is due to the divide-by-8 counter. Temporarily shorting the CONTROL pin to the SOURCE pin will reset TOPSwitch-GX , which then will come \nup in the correct state.BENCH TEST PRECAUTIONS FOR EVALUATION OF ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nTypical Performance Characteristics\n0.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.01.1\n60\n4080100120140160180200\n-250 -200 -150 -100 -50\nIX or IM (µA)Current Limit (A)\ndi/dt (mA/ µs)PI-2653-031904\n0Scaling Factors:\nTOP242 P/G/Y/R/F: .45\nTOP243 P/G:           .75TOP243 Y/R/F:        .90\nTOP244 P/G:              \n1\nTOP244 Y/R/F:      1.35TOP245 Y/R/F:      1.80TOP246 Y/R/F:      2.70\nTOP247 Y/R/F:      3.60\nTOP248 Y/R/F       4.50\nTOP249 Y/R/F:      5.40\nTOP250 Y/R/F:      6.32\n0.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.01.1\n60\n4080100120140160180200\n0 5 K 10K 15K 20K 25K 30K 35K 40K\nExternal Current Limit Resistor RIL (Ω)Current Limit (A )\ndi/dt (mA/ µs)PI-2652-042303\n45KMaximum and minimum levels \nare based on characterization.
