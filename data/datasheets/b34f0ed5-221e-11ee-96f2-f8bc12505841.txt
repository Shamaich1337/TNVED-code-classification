The \ndevice also provides dual differential output drivers, which \ncan be independently programmed to deliver -1dBm to \n+8dBm differential output power. Both outputs can be \nmuted by either software or hardware control.\nThe MAX2871 is controlled by a 4-wire serial interface and \nis compatible with 1.8V control logic. The device is available \nin a lead-free, RoHS-compliant, 5mm x 5mm, 32-pin TQFN \npackage, and operates over an extended -40°C to +85°C \ntemp erature ran ge.\nThe MAX2871 has an improved feature set and better overall \nphase noise and is fully pin and software-compatible with the \nMAX2870.\nApplicationsBenefits and Features\n ●Output Binary Buffers/Dividers Enable Extended \nFrequenc y Ran ge \n• Divider Ratios  of 1/2/4/8/16/32/64/128 \n• 23.5MH z to 6000MHz \n ●High-Perfor mance Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) \nand Reference Frequency Reduces Spectral Noise \n• PFD Up to 140MHz \n• Reference Frequency Up to 210MHz \n ●Low Normalized Inband Phase Noise of -230dBc/Hz \nReduces System Noise Floor Contribution \n ●Manual/Automatic VCO Selection Permits Fast \nSwitching \n ●Output Phase Reset and Adjustment Allow \nSynchronization of Multiple Synthesizers \n ●On-Chip Temperature Sensor with 7-Bit ADC Ensures \nOptimum VCO Selection \n ●Cycle Slip Reduction and Fast Lock Features \nImprove Accuracy and Acquisition Time \n ●VCO Lock Maintained Over Entire Temperature \nRange Provides Glitch-Free Operation \n ●Dual Differential Programmable Outputs Maximize \nFlexibility of Use \nOrdering Information  and “Typical Application Circuit”  \nappears at end of data sheet. ●Wireless Infrastructure\n ●Test and Measurement ●Clock Generation\n ●Microwave Radios\n19-7106; Rev 4; 6/20REF_IN\nCLK\nDATA\nLEX2MUX MUX DIVIDE-BY-2 R COUNTER\nINTEGER FRAC\nMAIN\nMODULATORMODULUSVCOSPI AND\nREGISTERS\nDIV-BY-\n1/2/4/8\nMUXDIV-BY-\n1/2/4/8/16\nMUXMUX\nLOCK DETECT\nCHARGE\nPUMPMUX\nLD\nCP_OUT\nGND_CP\nTUNE\nRFOUTA_P\nRFOUTB_PRFOUT_ENRFOUTA_N\nRFOUTB_N\nN COUNTERMAX2871\nMAX2871 23.5MHz to 6000MHz Fractional/  \nInteger-N Synthesizer/VCO\n  Functional DiagramEVALUATION KIT AVAILABLE\nVCC_ to GND_  ...................................................... -0.3V to +3.9V\nAll Other Pins to GND_  ............................. -0.3V to V CC_ + 0.3V\nContinuous Power Dissipation (T A = +70 °C)\n TQFN-EP Multilayer Board\n (derate 34.5mW/°C above +70 °C) ......................... 2758.6mWJunction Temperature  ...................................................... +150 °C\nOperating Temperature Range  ........................... -40°C to +85 °C\nStorage Temperature Range  ............................ -65°C to +150 °C\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s)  ................................  +300 °C\nSoldering Temperature (reflow)  ....................................... +260 °C\nTQFN  \nJunction-to-Ambient Thermal Resistance (θ JA) .......... 29°C/W  Junction-to-Case Thermal Resistance (θ JC) .............. 1.7°C/W(Note 1)\n(Measured using MAX2871 EV Kit.

For \nread operation, in addition to the above 3 pins, MUX pin \ncan be used to access Reg, 0x06, refer Figure 2 . The \nMAX2871 serial interface contains six write-only and \none read-only 32-bit registers. The 29 most-significant \nbits (MSBs) are data, and the three least-significant bits \n(LSBs) are the register address. Register data is loaded \nMSB first through the 4-wire serial interface (SPI). When \nLE is logic-low, the logic level at DATA is shifted at the ris -\ning edge of CLK. At the rising edge of LE, the 29 data bits \nare latched into the register selected by the address bits. \nThe user must program all register values after power-up.\nUpon power-up, the registers should be programmed \ntwice with at least a 20ms pause between cycle of \nwrite. The first write ensures that the device is enabled, \nand the second write starts the VCO selection pro -\ncess. Recommended to turn-off the outputs during this \nsequence and then turn-on the outputs using RFA_EN, \nRFB_EN. \nFor a clean clock at start up, after power on, follow  this \nsequence of programming:\n● Register 5, Address 0X05. Wait 20ms\n● Register 4, set bit 5 and 8 to 0 to keep RFOUT disable.\n● Register 3, Address 0X03\n● Register 2, Address 0X02\n● Register 1, Address 0X01\n● Register 0, Address 0X00\n● Register 5, Address 0X05● Register 4, set bit 5 and 8 to 0 to keep RFOUT disable.\n● Register 3, Address 0X03\n● Register 2, Address 0X02\n● Register 1, Address 0X01\n● Register 0, Address 0X00\nTo enable RFOUT, Register 4, Address 0X04, set bit 5 \nand 8 to 1.\nRegister programming order should be address 0x05, \n0x04, 0x03, 0x02, 0x01, and 0x00. Several bits are \ndouble buffered to update the settings at the same time. \nSee the register descriptions for double buffered settings.\nRead Sequence\nRegi ster 0x06 can be read back through the MUX pin. \nThe user must set MUX (register 5, bit 18 and register \n2, bits 28:26) = 1100. To begin the read sequence, set \nLE to logic-low, send 32 periods of CLK, and set LE to \nlogic-high. While the CLK is running, the DATA pin can \nbe held at logic-high or logic-low for 29 clocks, but the \nlast 3 bits must be 110 to indicate register 6, then set LE \nback to logic-high after the 32nd clock. Finally, send 1 \nperiod of the clock. The MSB of register 0x06 appears \nafter the rising edge of the next clock and continues to \nshift out for the next 29 clock cycles ( Figure 2 ). After the \nLSB of register 0x06 has been  read, the user can reset \nMUX register = 0000.\nPower Modes\nThe MA X2871 can be put into low-power mode by setting \nSHDN = 1 (register 2, bit 5) or by setting the CE pin to log -\nic-low. In low-power mode, all blocks except SPI are off.\nFigure 1.

In shut -\ndown mode this input is set to high impedance to prevent \nloading of the reference source.\nThe reference input signal path also includes optional x2 \nand ÷2 blocks. When the reference doubler is enabled \n(DBR = 1), the maximum reference input frequency is lim -\nited to 105MHz. When the doubler is disabled, the refer -\nence input frequency is limited to 210MHz. The minimum \nreference frequency is 10MHz. The minimum R counter \ndivide ratio is 1, and the maximum divide ratio is 1023.\nPFD Frequency\nThe phase-detector frequency is determined as follows:\nfPFD = fREF x [(1 + DBR)/(R x (1 + RDIV2))]\nfREF represe nts the external reference input frequency. \nDBR (register 2, bit 25) sets the f REF input frequency dou -\nbler mode (0 or 1). RDIV2 (register 2, bit 24) sets the f REF \ndivide-by-2 mode (0 or 1). R (register 2, bits 23:14) is the \nvalue of the 10-bit programmable reference counter (1 to \n1023). The maximum f PFD is 125MHz for frac-N mode and 140MHz for int-N mode. The R-divider can be held in reset \nwhen RST (register 2, bit 3) = 1.\nInt, Frac, Mod, and R Counter Relationship\nThe VCO frequency (f VCO), N, F, and M can be deter -\nmined based on desired RF output frequency (f RFOUTA ) \nas follows:\nSet DIVA value property based on f RFOUTA  and Table 4  \n(register 4, bits 22:20)\nfVCO = fRFOUTA  x DIVA\nIf bit FB = 1, (DIVA is not in PLL feedback loop):\nN + (F/M) = f VCO/ fPFD\nIf bit FB = 0, (DIVA is in PLL feedback loop) and DIVA ≤ \n16:\nN + (F/M) = (f VCO/fPFD)/DIVA\nIf bit FB = 0, (DIVA is in PLL feedback loop) and DIVA > 16:\nN + (F/M) = (f VCO/ fPFD)/16\nN is the value of the 16-bit N counter (16 to 65535), pro -\ngrammable through bits 30:15 of register 0. M is the frac -\ntional modulus value (2 to 4095), programmable through \nbits 14:3 of register 1. F is the fractional division value (0 \nto MOD - 1), programmable through bits 14:3 of register 0. \nIn frac-N mode, the minimum N value is 19 and maximum Figure 3. Reference InputFigure 2.

The N counter is held in reset when RST \n= 1 (register 2, bit 3). DIVA is the RF output divider setting \n(0 to 7), programmable through bits 22:20 of register 4. \nThe division ratio is set by 2 DIVA.\nThe RF B output frequency is determined as follows:\nIf BDIV = 0 (register 4, bit 9), f RFOUTB  = fRFOUTA .\nIf BD IV = 1, f RFOUTB  = fVCO.\nInt-N/Frac-N Modes\nInteger-N mode is selected by setting bit INT = 1 (register \n0, bit 31). When operating in integer-N mode, it is also \nnecessary to set bit LDF (register 2, bit 8) to set the lock \ndetect to integer-N mode.\nThe device’s frac-N mode is selected by setting bit INT = 0 \n(register 0, bit 31). Additionally, set bit LDF = 0 (register 2, \nbit 8) for frac-N lock-detect mode.\nIf the device is in frac-N mode, it will remain in frac-N \nmode when fractional division value F = 0, which can \nresult in unwanted spurs. To avoid this condition, the \ndevice can automatically switch to integer-N mode when \nF = 0 if the bit F01 = 1 (register 5, bit 24).\nPhase Detector and Charge Pump\nThe device’s charge-pump current is determined by the \nvalue of the resistor from pin RSET to ground and the \nvalue of bits CP (register 2, bits 12:9) as follows:\nICP = 1.63/R SET x (1+ CP<3:0>)\nTo reduce spurious in frac-N mode, set charge-pump  \nlinearity bits CPL = 00/01/10/11 (register 1, bits 30:29). \nThe user can determine which mode works best for their \napplication. For int-N mode, set CPL = 00. The charge-pump output can be put into high-impedance \nmode when TRI = 1 (register 2, bit 4). The output is in \nnormal mode when TRI = 0.\nThe phase detector polarity can be changed if an active \ninverting loop filter topology is used. For noninverting loop \nfilters, set PDP = 1 (register 2, bit 6). For inverting loop \nfilters, set PDP = 0.\nMUX\nMUX is a multipurpose input/output for observing and \ncontrolling various internal functions of the MAX2871. \nMUX can also be configured as serial data output. Bits \nMUX (register 5, bit 18 and register 2, bit 28:26) are used \nto select the desired MUX function (see Table 5 ).\nLock Detect\nLock detect can be monitored through the LD output by \nsetting the LD bits (register 5, bits 23:22). For digital lock \ndetect, set LD = 01. The digital lock detect is dependent \non the mode of the synthesizer. In frac-N mode set LDF = \n0, and in int-N mode set LDF = 1. To set the accuracy of \nthe digital lock detect, see Table 1  and Table 2 .\nAnalog lock detect can be set with LD = 10. In this mode, \nLD is an open-drain output and requires an external  \npullup resistor of 10kΩ typical value.\nThe lock detect output validity is dependent on many \nfactors. The lock detect output is not valid during VCO \nauto selection process. After the VCO auto selection \nprocess has completed, the lock detect output is not \nvalid until the TUNE voltage has settled. TUNE voltage \nsettling time is dependent on loop filter bandwidth, and \ncan be calculated using EE-Sim Simulation tool found at  \nwww.maximintegrated.com .\nTable 2.

It is enabled by setting CSM bit (register \n3, bit 18) to 1. In this mode, the charge pump must be set \nto its minimum value.\nFast-Lock\nAnother method to decrease lock time is to use a fast-lock \nmode. This mode requires that CP = 0000 (register 2, \nbits 12:9) and that the shunt resistive portion of the loop \nfilter be segmented into two parts, where one resistor \n(R2A) is 1/4 of the total resistance, and the other resistor \n(R2B) is 3/4 of the total resistance. The larger resistor \n(R2B) should be connected from SW to Ground, and the \nsmaller resistor (R2A) from SW to the loop filter capacitor \n(see Figure 4 ). When CDM = 01 (register 3, bits 16:15), \nfast-lock is active after the VAS has completed. During \nfast-lock, the charge pump is increased to CP = 1111 and \nthe shunt loop filter resistance is set to 1/4 of the total \nresistance by changing pin SW from high impedance to \nground. Fast-lock deactivates after a timeout set by the \nuser. This timeout is loop filter dependent, and is set by:\ntFAST-LOCK  = M x CDIV/f PFD\nwhere M is the modulus setting and CDIV is the clock \ndivider setting. The user must determine the CDIV setting \nbased on their loop filter time constant. The SW pin can \nbe left open/ no connect when fast lock mode is not used.\nRFOUTA± and RFOUTB±\nThe device has dual differential open-collector RF out -\nputs that require an external RF choke or a 50Ω resistor \nto supply for each output. Each differential output can \nbe independently enabled or disabled by setting bits \nRFA_EN (register 4, bit 5) and RFB_EN (register 4, bit 8). \nBoth outputs are also controlled by applying a logic-high \n(enabled) or logic-low (disabled) to pin RFOUT_EN.\nThe output power of each output can be individually con -\ntrolled with APWR (register 4, bits 4:3) for RFOUTA and \nBPWR (register 4, bits 7:6) for RFOUTB. The available dif -\nferential output power settings are from -4dBm to +5dBm, \nin 3dB steps with 50Ω pullup to supply. The available \nsingle-ended output power ranges from -4dBm to +5dBm \nin 3dB steps with a RF choke to supply. Across the entire \nfrequency range different pullup elements (L or R) are \nrequired for optimal output power. If single-ended output \nis used, the unused output should be supplied and termi -\nnated in the same manner as the corresponding load. If a \ndifferential output is unused then those RFOUT pins should \nbe directly connected to VCC_RF (pin 16). To prevent undesired frequencies from being output while \nacquiring lock, the output power can be disabled when \nthe PLL is unlocked by using MTLD (register 4, bit 10). A \nlogic 1 will disable the outputs when the digital lock detect \nis logic low. When acquiring lock the output can over -\nshoot and pass through the desired frequency. In some \ncircumstances, the digital lock detect will flicker high dur -\ning these periods. To prevent this from happening, a timer \ncan be used to delay the output from enabling after losing \nlock. Enable MUTEDEL (register 3, bit 17) with MTLD \nenabled to use this function. The delay for enabling the \noutput is set by:\nDelay = CDIV x M/f PFD\nwhere CDIV (register 3, bits 14:3) is the clock divider, \nM (register 1, bits 14:3) is the variable modulus for the \nfractional N modulator, and f PFD is the phase detector \nfrequency.\nVoltage-Controlled Oscillator\nThe fun damental VCO frequency of the device guarantees \ngap-free coverage from 3.0GHz to 6.0GHz using four \nindividual VCO core blocks with 16 sub-bands within each \nblock. Connect the output of the loop filter to the TUNE \ninput. The TUNE input is used to control the VC O.Figure 4.

To digitize the tuning voltage, do the following:\n1)  Set bits CDIV (register 3, bits 14:3) = f PFD/100kHz to \nset the clock speed for the ADC.\n2)  Set bits ADCM (register 5, bits 5:3) = 100 to enable \nthe ADC to read the TUNE pin voltage.\n3)  Set bit ADCS (register 5, bit 6) = 1 to start  the ADC \nconversion process.\n4)  Wait 100µs for the conversion process to finalize.\n5)  Read back register 6. The ADC value is located in bits \n22:16.\n6)  Reset bits ADCM = 0 and ADCS = 0.\nThe voltage on the TUNE pin can be calculated as:\nV = 0.315 + ADC x 0.0165\nVCO Autoselect (VAS) State Machine\nAn inter nal VCO autoselect state machine is initiated \nwhen register 0 is programmed to automatically select \nthe correct VCO if bit VAS_SHDN = 0 (register 3, bit 25).\nThe state machine clock, f BS, must be set to 50kHz. This \nis set by the BS bits (register 4, bits 25:24, 19:12). The \nformula for setting BS is:\nBS = f PFD/50kHz\nwhere f PFD is the phase-detector frequency. The BS value \nshould be rounded to the nearest integer. If the calcu -\nlated BS is higher than 1023, then set BS = 1023. If f PFD \nis lower than 50kHz, then set BS = 1. The time needed to \nselect the correct VCO is 10/f BS.\nThe VAS_TEMP bit (register 3, bit 24) can be used to \nselect the best VCO for the given ambient temperature \nto ensure that the VCO will not drift out of lock if the tem -\nperature changes within -40°C to +85°C. Bits RFA_EN \n(register 4, bit 5) and RFB_EN (register 4, bit 8) must be \n0, and bits 30:29 of register 5 must be set to 11 during \nVCO acquisition. Setting VAS_TEMP = 1 will increase the \ntime needed to achieve lock from 10/f BS to approximately \n100ms.If VAS_SHDN = 1, then the VCO can be manually \nselected by bits VCO (register 3, bits 31:26). Refer to \nApplications Information  for detailed implementation of \nVCO manual selection.\nPhase Adjustment\nAfter achieving lock, the phase of the single MAX2871 \ndevice’s RF output can be changed in increments of P \n(register 1, bits 26:15) /M (register 1, bits 14:3) x 360°.\nAlso, multiple MAX2871 devices’ RF Outputs can be \nphase synchronized with a single reference input. See \nApplications Information  for detailed implementation.\nLow-Spur Mode\nThe device offers three modes for the sigma-delta modu -\nlator. Low-noise mode offers lower in-band noise at the \nexpense of spurs. The spurs can be reduced by setting \nSDN = 10 (register 2, bits 30:29) or SDN = 11 for different \nmodes of dithering. The user can determine which mode \nworks best for their application.\nTemperature Sensor\nThe device is equipped with an on-chip temperature sen -\nsor and 7-bit ADC.\nTo read the digitized output of the temperature sensor:\n1) Set bits CDIV (register 3, bits 14:3) = f PFD/100kHz to \nset the clock speed for the ADC.\n2) Set bits ADCM (register 5, bits 5:3) = 001 to enable the \nADC to read the temperature.\n3) Set bit ADCS (register 5, bit 6) = 1 to start the ADC \nconversion process.\n4) Wait 100µs for the conversion process to finalize.\n5) Read back register 6. The ADC value is located in bits \n22:16.\n6) Reset bits ADCM=0 and ADCS=0.\nThe approximate ambient temperature can be converted \nas:\nt = 95 – 1.14 x ADC\nThis formula is most accurate when the VCO is enabled \nand RFOUTA is enabled at full output power. The tem -\nperature can vary based on output power and if one or \nboth outputs are enabled.\nMAX2871 23.5MHz to 6000MHz Fractional/  \nInteger-N Synthesizer/VCO\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 17\nRegister and Bit Descriptions\nThe operating mode of the device is controlled by six on-\nchip registers.\nDefaults are not guaranteed upon power-up and are  \nprovided for reference only. All reserved bits should only be written with default values. In low-power mode, the \nregister values are retained. Upon power-up, the registers \nshould be programmed twice with at least a 20ms pause \nbetween writes.

The VCC_ traces branch out from this node, \neach going to a separate VCC_ node in the circuit. Place \na bypass capacitor as close as possible to each supply \npin This arrangement provides local decoupling at each \nVCC_ pin.
