The ADM3055E/ \nADM3057E meet flexible data rate (CAN FD ) requirements for \noperation to 5 Mbps and higher and comply with the ISO 11898 -2: \n2016 standard. The ADM3055E /ADM3057E are capable of \nsupporting  data rates as high as 12 Mbps.  \nThe devices employ Analog Devices, Inc., iCoupler® technology to combine a 3 -channel isolator, a CAN transceiver, and an \nAnalog Devices isoPower® dc -to-dc converter into a single, surface -\nmount, small outline integrated circuit (SOIC) package. The \ndevices are powered by a single 5  V supply , realizing a fully isolated  \nsolution for CAN and CAN FD. Radiated emissions from the high frequency switching of the dc -to-dc convertor s are kept \nbelow EN 55022 Class B limits by continuous adjustments to \nthe switching frequency.

Safety and regulatory approvals (pending) for 5 kV rms isolation  voltage, \n10 kV surge test, and 8.3 mm creepage and c learance  ensure the \nADM3055E meets application  reinforced  isolation r equirements. \nThe ADM3057E has an isolation voltage of 3 kV rms and \n7.8 mm creepage in a 20 -lead, wide body SOIC.   \nLow propagation delays through the isolation support longer bus cables. Slope control mode is available for standard CAN at low data rates. Standby mode minimizes power consumption when the bus is idle or if the node goes offline. Silent mode allows the TX D input to be ignored for listen only mode . \nDominant timeout function ality protects against bus lock up in \na fault condition . The  current limiting and thermal shutdown \nfeatures protect against output short circuits. The devices are fully specified over an industrial temperature range of −40°C to +105°C.  \n \nADM3055E /ADM3057E Data Sheet\n \nRev.

A | Page 20 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nCAN TRAN SCEIVER OPERATION  \nThe ADM3055E /ADM3057E  facilitate communication between \na CAN controller and the CAN bus. The CAN controller and \nthe ADM3055E /ADM3057E  communicate with standard 1.8  V,  \n2.5 V , 3.3 V , or 5.0 V CMOS levels. The internal transceiver \ntranslates the CMO S levels to and from the CAN bus.  \nThe CAN  bus has two states : dominant and recessive. The recessiv e \nstate is present on the bus when the differential voltage between \nCANH and CANL is less than 0.5 V . In the recessive state, the \nCANH and CANL pin s are set to high impedan ce and are \nloosely biased to a single -ended voltage of 2.5  V.  A dominant state \nis present on the bus whe n the differential voltage between \nCANH and CANL is greater than 1.5 V.  The transceiver transmits \na dominant state by driving th e single -ended voltage of the \nCANH pin to 3.5 V and the CANL pin to 1. 5 V. The recessive  \nand dominant states correspond  to CMOS high and CMOS low, \nrespectively , on the RXD pin and TXD pin . \nA dominant state from another node overwrite s a recessive state  \non the bus . A CAN frame  can be set for  higher priority by using \na longer string of dominant bits to gain control of the CAN bus \nduring  the arbitration phase. While transmitting, a CAN \ntransceiver  also read s back the state of the bus.  When a CAN \ncontroller receives  a dominant state while transmitting a \nrecessive  state during arbitration , the CAN controller  surrender s \nthe bus  to the node still transmitting the dominant state.  The \nnode that gains control during the arbitration phase  read s back \nonly its own tr ansmission. This interaction between  recessive \nand dominant states  allows competing nodes to negotiate for \ncontrol of the bus while avoiding contention  between nodes . \nIndus trial applications can have  long cable runs. These long \nruns may have differences in  local earth potential. Different \nsources may also power nodes . The ADM3055E transceiver \nhas a ±25 V common -mode range (CMR) that exceeds the \nISO 11898- 2:2016 requirement and further increases the \ntolerance to ground variation.   \nSee the AN -1123 Application Note  for additional information \non CAN.  \nSIGNAL AND POWER  ISOLATION  \nThe ADM3055E  and the ADM3057E  provide galvanic signal \nisolation implemented on the logic side of the interface. The RXD and TXD isolation channels transmit and receive with an on/off \nkeying (OOK) architecture on the iCouple r digital isolation \ntechnology.  \nThe ADM3055E and the ADM3057E feature  independent power  \nsupply pins for isolated power  (the V\nCC pin) and isolated signal \n(the VIO pin). The VCC pin requires a nominal 5  V supply to \nproduce the 5  V isolated power. The V IO pin may be supplied \nwith a nominal 1.8  V to a nominal 5 V . The lo gic input and \noutput levels scale to the voltage supplied  to the V IO pin. The isolated power from the VISOOUT  pin must be supplied to the \nVISOIN pin to power  the bus side digital isolator  and transceiver . \nSTANDBY MODE  \nThe STBY pin engages a reduced power standby mode that  \nmodi fies the operation of both the CAN transceiver and digital \nisolation channels. Standby mode disables the TXD signal isolation channel and sets the transmitter output to a high impedance state loosely biased to GND\n2. Wh ile in standby \nmode , the receiver filt ers bus data and responds only after the \nremote wake -up sequence is received .  \nWhen entering or exiting standby mode, the TXD input must be kept high and the RXD output must be ignored  for the full t\nSTBY_ON  \nand t STBY_OFF  times. STBY does not control or modify behavior of \nthe isoPower integrated dc -to-dc converter. The dc -to-dc converter \ncontinues to operate and provide the power to the bus side.   \nREMOTE WAKE UP  \nThe ADM3055E  and the ADM3057E  respond to the remote \nwake -up sequence as defined in ISO  11898- 2:2016. When  CAN \nchannels are presented with the defined slow speed high  low \nhigh sequence  within the low wake -up pattern detection reset \ntime (t WUPR), low speed data transmission is  allowed.  \nSuccessful receipt of the remot e wake -up pattern does not bring \nthe ADM3055E and the ADM3057E out of standby mode. The ADM3055E STBY pin must be brought low externally to exit \nstandby mode. After the ADM3055E or ADM3057E device \nreceives the remote wake- up pattern , the transceiver contin ues \nto receive low speed data until standby mode is exited.  \nSILENT MODE  \nAsserting the SILENT pin  disables the TXD digital isolation \nchannel. Any inputs to the TXD pin  are ignored in this mode , \nand the transceiver presents a recessive bus state . The operation \nof the RXD channel is unaffected. The RXD channel continue s \nto output data  received from the internal CAN transceiver \nmonitoring the bus . \nSilent mode is useful when paired with a CAN controller  using \nautomatic baud rate detection. A CAN controlle r must be set to \nthe same data rate as all attached nodes. The CAN controller produces an error frame and ties up the bus with a dominant state \nwhen the received data rate is different from expected. Other CAN nodes then echo this error frame. While in sil ent mode, \nthe error frames produced by the CAN controller are kept from interrupting bus traffic, and the controller can continue listening \nto bus traffic to tune.  \n \n \nData Sheet  ADM3055E/ ADM3057E \n \nRev. A | Page 21 of 24 RS PIN \nThe RS pin sets the transceiver in one of three different modes \nof operation : high speed, slope control, or standby . This pin \ncannot be left floating.  \nFor high speed mode, connect the RS pin directly to GND 2. \nEnsure that the transition time of the CAN bus signals are as \nshort as possible  to allow higher speed signaling. A shielded \ncable is recommended to avoid electromagnetic interference \n(EMI ) problems in high speed mode.  \nSlope control mode allows the use of unshielded twisted pair \nwires  or parallel pair wires as bus lines. Slow t he signal rise and \nfall transition times to reduce EMI a nd ringing  in slope control \nmode . Adjust t he rise and fall slopes by adding a resistor (R SLOPE) \nconnected from  RS to GND 2. The slope is proportional to the \ncurrent output at the RS pin .  \nThe RS pin can also set the CAN transceiver to standby mode , \nwhich occurs when the pin is driven to a voltage above V STB. In \nstandby mode, high  speed data is filtered , and the CANH and \nCANL lines are biased to GND 2. \nThe RS pin can only set the CAN transceiver to standby  mode . \nThe state of the RS pin does not modify the o peration of  digital \nisolation channels  or the auxiliary  channel.  \nAUXILIARY CHANNEL  \nThe a uxiliary channel is available for low speed data transmission  \nat up to 20  kHz (or 40  kbps nonreturn -to-zero format) when \nSTBY is not asserted. The data rate  limit of the channel  allows the \ndata channel to be shared by the STBY signal.  \nIn standby mode, or when  STBY is driven high, the operation of \nthe channel is modified to share the multiplexed  signal path \nwith the STBY signal ( see Figure 1). The AUX OUT pin remains \nlatched in the state when STBY i s asserted. Periodic pulses \n(<25  µs wide) are sent to indicate that the logic side is powered \nand remains in standby  mode . \nIn applications where AUX OUT may be shorted to GND 2 or V DD2, \nadd a series resistance to the output channel.  \nAn example of using this auxiliary  channel to control a switchable  \ntermination from the logic side is demonstrated on the  EVA L -\nADM3055E EBZ  evaluation board.  \nINTEGRATED AND CERTI FIED IEC EMC SOLUTIO N \nTypically, designers must add protections against harsh operating \nenvironments while also making the p roduct as small as possible. \nTo reduce board space and the design effort needed to meet system \nlevel ESD standards, the ADM3055E and the ADM3057E include  \nrobust protection circuitry on chip for the CANH and CANL lines.  FAULT PROTECTION  \nMiswire  events commonly occur when the system power supply \nis connected directly to the CANH and CANL bus lines during assembly. The ADM3055E  and the ADM3057E  CAN bus pin s \nare protected against such high voltage miswire events. The \nADM3055E  and the ADM3057E  CANH and CANL  signal lines \ncan withstand continuous ± 40 V with respect to GND\n2 or +40 V \nbetween the CAN bus lines without damage. This level of protection applies when  the device i s either powered or \nunpowered.  \nThe ADM3055E provides IEC  61000 -4-2 Level 4 ESD p rotection , \nbut some applications may require further system level protection.  \nThe symmetrical nature of the ADM3055E ± 40 V bus fault \nprotection and  the ±25 V CMR  makes the selection of \nbidirectional transient voltage suppressor ( TVS ) diodes easier.  \nFAIL -SAFE FEATURES  \nIn cases where the TXD  input pin is allowed to float,  to prevent \nbus traffic interruption, the TXD input channel has an internal pull-up to the V\nIO pin. The pull -up hold s the transceiver in the \nrecessive state.  \nThe ADM3055E and the ADM3057E feature  a dominant timeout  \n(tDT in Table 2). A TXD line shorted to ground or malfunctioning \nCAN controller are examples of how a single node c an indef initely  \nprevent further bus traffic. The dominant  timeout  limits  how \nlong the do minant state can  transmit  to the CAN bus  by the \ntransceiver . When the TXD pin is presented with a logic high, \nnormal  TXD function ality  is restore d. \nThe t DT minimum also inherently creates a minimum data  rate. \nUnder normal operation, the CAN protocol allows five consecutive  \nbits of the same polarity before stuffing a bit of the opposite \npolarity into the  transmitting  bit sequence. When an error is \ndetected, the CAN control ler purposely violate s the bit stuffing \nrules by producing six  consecutive dominant bits. A t any given \ndata rate, the CAN controller must transmit as many as 11 consecutive dominant bits to  effectively limit  the ADM3055E \nand the ADM3057E minimum data  rate to 9600 bps.  \nTHERMAL SHUTDOWN  \nThe ADM3055E  and the ADM3057E contain thermal \nshutdown circuitry that protects the devices  from excessive \npower dissipation during fault conditions. Shorting the driver outputs to a low impedance source can result in high driver \ncurrents. The thermal sensing circuitry detects the increase in \ndie temperature under this condition and disables t he driver \noutputs. The  circuitry disable s the driver outputs when the  die \ntemperature reaches 175°C . When the die has cool ed, the \ndrivers are enable d again . \n \n \nADM3055E/ ADM3057E Data Sheet  \n \nRev. A | Page 22 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nPCB LAYOUT  \nPower supply bypassing is required at the logic input supply, \nVIO, and at the shared CAN transceiver and digital isolator \ninput supply pin, V ISOIN. Low equivalent series resistance (ESR) \nbypass capacitors are required and must be placed as close to the chi p pads as possible. The ADM3055E and the ADM3057E  \nsignal and power isolated CAN transceivers  do not require \nexternal interface circuitry for the logic interfaces.  \nThe integrated dc -to-dc converter supply input  pin, V\nCC, requires  \nparallel 10  µF and 0.1  µF bypass capacitors placed close  to the \npin. Noise suppression requires a low induc tance, high frequency  \ncapacitor. R ipple suppression and proper regulation require a \nlarge value capacitor. Effective bypass capacitance is also \nrequired on the isolated outp ut supply pin, V ISOOUT , for proper \noperation of the integrated dc -to-dc converter. Note that the \ntotal trace length between the ends of the low ESR capacitor s \nand the input power supply pin s, VCC, V IO, V ISOIN, and VISOOUT , \nmust not exceed 2  mm.  \nRADIATED E MISSIONS AND PCB LAY OUT  \nThe ADM3055E  and the ADM3057E  signal and power isolated \nCAN FD transceiver s pass EN  55022 Class B by 6  dB on a 2-layer \nPCB design  with ferrite beads . Neither PCB s titching capacitance  \nnor high voltage surface -mounted technology ( SMT ) safety \ncapacitors  are required to meet this emissions level . \nThe ADM3055E and the ADM3057E have an internal split pad \nlead frame on the bus side  to isolate noise generated by  the dc -\nto-dc converter from the transceiver. For best noise suppression, \nfilter  both the V ISOOUT  power supply pin and  GND ISO power \nsupply return pin  for high frequency currents  before routing \npower to the transceiver . Use surface -mount ferrite beads in \nseries with the signals , as shown in Figure 33. \nThe isoPower integrated dc -to-dc converters of the ADM3055E  \nand the ADM3057E produce a 180 MHz carrier frequency to \ntransmit power through the chip scale transformer. The \nimpedance of t he ferrite bead  must be  approximately 2  kΩ \nbetween the 100  MHz and 1  GHz frequency range  to reduce the \nemissions of the 180 MHz primary switching frequency and \n360 MHz secondary side rectifying frequency.

Recommended PCB Layout  \nTHERMAL ANALYSIS  \nThe ADM3055E  and the ADM3057E  consist of six  internal die  \nattached to a split lead frame with four  die attach pads. For the \npurposes  of thermal analysis, the die are  treated as a thermal \nunit, with the highest junction temperature reflected in the θ JA \nvalue in Table 10. The θ JA value is based on measurements taken \nwith the devices mounted on a JEDEC standard, 4 -layer board \nwith fine width traces and still air. Under normal operating conditions, the ADM3055E  and the ADM3057E  can operate at \nfull load across the full temperature range without derating the \noutput current.  \nINSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected to voltage stress over a sufficiently long period  of time . The rate \nof insulation degradation is dependent on the characteristics of the voltage waveform applied across the insulation as well as on \nthe materials and material interfaces.  \nThe two types of insulation degradation of primary interest are  \nbreakdown alon g surfaces exposed to the air and insulation \nwear out. Surface breakdown is the phenomenon of surface tracking and is the primary determinant of surface creepage \nrequirements in system level standards. Insulation wear out is the phenomenon where charge inj ection or displacement \ncurrents inside the insulation material cause long- term \ninsulation degradation.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nData Sheet  ADM3055E/ ADM3057E \n \nRev. A | Page 23 of 24 Surface Tracking  \nSurface tracking is addressed in electrical safety standards by \nsetting a minimum surface creepage based on the working voltage , the environmental conditions, and the properties of the \ninsulation material. Safety agencies perform characterization \ntesting on the surface insulation of components , allowing the \ncomponents to be categorized in different material groups. \nLower material group ratings are more re sistant to surface \ntracking and  can therefore provide adequate lifetime with \nsmaller creepage. The minimum creepage for a given working voltage and material group is in each system level standard and \nis based on the total rms volta ge across the isolation, pollution \ndegree, and material group. See Table 3 for the material group \nand creepage information for the ADM3055E and the ADM3057E \nisolated CAN transceivers .  \nInsulation Wear Out  \nThe lifetime of insulation caused by wear out is determined by \nthe thickness, material properties, and the voltage stress applied  \nacross the insulation . It is important to verify that the product \nlifetime is adequate at the application working voltage. The \nworking voltage supported by an isolator for wear out may not \nbe the same as the working voltage supported for tracking. The \nworking voltage applicable to tracking is specified in most standards.  \nTesting and modeling show  that the primary driver of long -term \ndegradation is displacement current in the polyimide insulation , \ncausing incremental damage. The stress on the insulation can be divided  into broad categories, such as  dc stress  and ac component , \ntime varying voltage stress. DC stress causes little wear out because \nthere is no displacement current, whereas  ac component , time \nvaryi ng voltage stress causes wear out.  \nThe ratings in certification documents are typically  based on \n60 Hz sinusoidal stres s to reflect  isolation from the line voltage. \nHowever, many practical applications have combinations  of 60  Hz \nac and dc across the barrier , as shown in Equation 1. Because \nonly the ac portion of the stress causes wear out, the equation \ncan be rearranged to  solve for the ac  rms voltage, as  shown in \nEquation 2. Fo r insulation wear out with the polyimide  materials \nused in these products, the ac rms voltage determines the \nproduct lifetime.  \n22\nRMS AC RMS DCVV V= +  (1) \nor \n22\nAC RMS RMS DCV VV= −  (2) \nwhere:  \nVRMS is the total rms working voltage.  \nVAC RMS  is the time varying portion of the working voltage.  \nVDC is the dc offset of the working voltage.  Calculation and Use of Parameters Example  \nThe following example frequently arises in power conversion applicatio ns. Assume that the line voltage on one side of the \nisolation is 240 V\nAC RMS , and a 400 V DC bus voltage is present on \nthe other side of the isolation barrier. The isolator material is \npolyimide. To establish the critical voltages used to determine  \nthe cree page, clearance , and lifetime of a device, see Figure 34 \nand the equations  that follow . ISOLATION VOLTAGE\nTIMEVAC RMS\nVRMS VDC VPEAK\n14972-014 \nFigure 34. Critical Voltage Example  \nThe working voltage across the barrier from Equation 1 is  \n22\nRMS AC RMS DCVV V= +  \n22240 400RMSV= +  \nVRMS = 466 V  \nUse this V RMS value as the working voltage in conjunction  with  \nthe material group and pollution degree  to determine the \ncreepage required by a system standard .  \nTo determine if the lifetime is adequate, obtain the time varying \nportion of the working voltage. To obtain the ac rms voltage, \nuse Equation 2.  \n22\nAC RMS RMS DCV VV= −  \n22466 400AC RMSV= −  \nVAC RMS  = 240 V RMS \nIn this case, the ac rms voltage is simply the line voltage of \n240 VRMS. This calculation is more relevant when the waveform  is \nnot sinusoidal. The calculated ac rms voltage  is compared to the \nlimits for the working voltage in Table 11 for the expected \nlifetime  of the device , which is less than a 60  Hz sine wave, and \nis well with in the limit f or a 50-year service life.  \nThe dc working voltage limit is set by the creepage of the \npackage as specified in IEC 60664- 1. This value can differ for \nspecific system level standards.  \n \nADM3055E/ ADM3057E Data Sheet  \n \nRev.
