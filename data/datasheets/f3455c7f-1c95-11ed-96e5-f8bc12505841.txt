The Bias ResistorTransistor (BRT) contains a single transistor with a monolithic biasnetwork consisting of two resistors; a series base resistor and abase-emitter resistor. The BRT eliminates these individualcomponents by integrating them into a single device. The use of a BRT\ncan reduce both system cost and board space.\nFeatures\n•Simplifies Circuit Design\n•Reduces Board Space\n•Reduces Component Count\n•S and NSV Prefix for Automotive and Other Applications\nRequiring Unique Site and Control Change Requirements;\nAEC-Q101 Qualified and PPAP Capable\n•These Devices are Pb-Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free and are RoHS\nCompliant\nMAXIMUM RATINGS  \n(TA = 25 °C, common for Q 1 and Q 2, unless otherwise noted)\nRating Symbol Max Unit\nCollector-Base Voltage VCBO 50 Vdc\nCollector-Emitter Voltage VCEO 50 Vdc\nCollector Current − Continuous IC 100 mAdc\nInput Forward Voltage VIN(fwd) 30 Vdc\nInput Reverse Voltage VIN(rev) 5 Vdc\nStresses exceeding those listed in the Maximum Ratings table may damage the\ndevice.

#### Description:
The MUN5233DW1T1G is a dual NPN transistor with an integrated monolithic bias resistor network. This component is designed to simplify circuit design by eliminating the need for external biasing resistors, thereby reducing the overall component count and board space required in electronic circuits. The device features two transistors that share a common emitter and base configuration, making it suitable for various applications where compactness and efficiency are critical.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Signal Processing:** Used in amplifiers and switching applications where low power consumption is essential.
- **Power Management:** Ideal for low-power applications in battery-operated devices due to its low current ratings and integrated biasing.
- **Automotive Electronics:** AEC-Q101 qualification makes it suitable for automotive applications, including control systems and sensor interfaces.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Commonly used in portable devices, where space-saving designs are necessary.

This component is particularly advantageous in designs where minimizing the number of discrete components is desired, leading to lower manufacturing costs and improved reliability.
