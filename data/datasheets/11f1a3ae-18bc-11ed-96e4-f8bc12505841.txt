The SM712 may be used to protect devices \nfrom transient voltages resulting from electrostatic \ndischarge (ESD), eletrical fast transients (EFT), and \nlightning. \nThe SM712 features more than 500 Watts (tp = 8/20 \nμs) of power handling capability to accommodate the \nhigher transient voltage levels which may be expected \nin extended commom mode applications.  This provides \nhigher equipment reliability and eliminates the “guess \nwork“ required when using Zener diodes that are not \nrated to handle such transient conditions. \nThe SM712 replaces four discrete components by \nintegrating two 12V and two 7V TVS diodes in a single \npackage.  The integrated design aids in reducing voltage \nover-shoot associated with trace inductance.

This minimizes voltage overshoot \ndue to parastic inductance of board traces. \n• Use ground planes whenever possible. \n• Long, single trace ground conductors should \nbe avoided.  The ground pin (Pin 3) should be \nconnected directly to a ground plane on the circuit \nboard for best results. \n• Minimize all conductive loops including power and \nground loops. \n• Never run critical signals near board edges. \nSM712\nFinal Datasheet  Rev 6.0 \n10/17/2017www.semtech.com Page 6 \nSemtech Outline Drawing - SOT-23 \nLand Pattern - SOT-23 Abbb CAB\nH\n0.25GAUGE PLANE\nSEE DETAIL A0c\nL\nL1\nDETAIL AN 3\n0 - 8° 0°\nDATUMS AND TO BE DETERMINED AT DATUM PLANE -A- -B- 2. -H-CSEATINGaaa Cbbb 0.20aaa 0.101 23\nE1 1.20 1.30 1.40\nE\nA1e1\neE1\nL1Db\necA1DIM\nA\n0.51\n0.180.30\n0.08\n(0.55)1.90 BSC-\n-\n2.90MILLIMETERS\nMAX\n0.101.20MINDIMENSIONS\n0.01NOM\n0.89\n--\nCONTROLLING DIMENSIONS ARE IN MILLIMETERS (ANGLES IN DEGREES).NOTES:\nOR GATE BURRS.DIMENSIONS "E1" AND "D" DO NOT INCLUDE MOLD FLASH, PROTRUSIONS 3.1.3.04 2.80\ne1 0.95 BSC\nL 0.50 0.40 0.60A2 - 0.88 1.10\nSIDE VIEWDbxNB\nA2\nPLANEAE\n2.10 2.64 -\nSEATING\nPLANE\nC\nNOTES:\n2.
