LT1677 series devices may be inserted directly into\nOP-07, OP-27, OP-37 and sockets with or without removalof external compensation or nulling components. In addi-\ntion, the LT1677 may be fitted to 741 sockets with the\nremoval or modification of external nulling components.\nRail-to-Rail Operation\nTo take full advantage of an input range that can exceed\nthe supply, the LT1677 is designed to eliminate phasereversal. Referring to the photographs shown in Figure 1,\nthe LT1677 is operating in the follower mode (A\nV = +1) at\na single 3V supply. The output of the LT1677 clips cleanly\nand recovers with no phase reversal. This has the benefit\nof preventing lock-up in servo systems and minimizing\ndistortion components.\nOffset Voltage Adjustment\nThe input offset voltage of the LT1677 and its drift with\ntemperature are permanently trimmed at wafer\ntesting to a low level. However, if further adjustment of\nVOS is necessary, the use of a 10k Ω nulling potentiometer\nwill not degrade drift with temperature. Trimming to a\nvalue other than zero creates a drift of (V OS/300) µV/°C,\ne.g., if V OS is adjusted to 300 µV, the change in drift will be\n1µV/°C (Figure 2).\nInput = – 0.5V to 3.5V LT1677 Output\n3V\n2V\n1V\n0V\n– 0.5V\n1577 F01a3V\n2V\n1V\n0V\n– 0.5V\n1577 F01b\nFigure 1.

If less adjustment range is needed, the sensitiv-\nity and resolution of the nulling can be improved by using\na smaller pot in conjunction with fixed resistors.

Air currents should beminimized, package leads should be short, the two input\nleads should be close together and maintained at the same\ntemperature.\nThe circuit shown to measure offset voltage is also used as\nthe burn-in configuration for the LT1677, with the supply\nvoltages increased to ±20V (Figure 4).\nFigure 4.

A small capacitor (20pF to 50pF) in parallel with R F\nwill eliminate this problem.\nNoise Testing\nThe 0.1Hz to 10Hz peak-to-peak noise of the LT1677 is\nmeasured in the test circuit shown (Figure 6a). The fre-quency response of this noise tester (Figure 6b) indicates\nthat the 0.1Hz corner is defined by only one zero. The test\ntime to measure 0.1Hz to 10Hz noise should not exceedten seconds, as this time limit acts as an additional zero to\neliminate noise contributions from the frequency band\nbelow 0.1Hz.\nMeasuring the typical 90nV peak-to-peak noise perfor-\nmance of the LT1677 requires special test precautions:\n1. The device should be warmed up for at least five\nminutes. As the op amp warms up, its offset voltage\nchanges typically 3 µV due to its chip temperature\nincreasing 10 °C to 20 °C from the moment the power\nsupplies are turned on. In the ten-second measurementinterval these temperature-induced effects can easily\nexceed tens of nanovolts.\n2. For similar reasons, the device must be well shielded\nfrom air currents to eliminate the possibility ofthermoelectric effects in excess of a few nanovolts,which would invalidate the measurements.\n3. Sudden motion in the vicinity of the device can also\n“feedthrough” to increase the observed noise.\nCurrent noise is measured in the circuit shown in Figure 7\nand calculated by the following formula:\nie nV\nMnno\n=()−()⎡\n⎣⎢⎤\n⎦⎥\n() ( )2 212\n130 101\n1 101•/\nΩ\nThe LT1677 achieves its low noise, in part, by operating\nthe input stage at 100 µA versus the typical 10 µA of most\nother op amps. Voltage noise is inversely proportionalwhile current noise is directly proportional to the square\nFigure 5. Pulsed Operation1677 F05LT1677\n–+RF\nOUTPUT2.5V/ µsUnity-Gain Buffer Application\nWhen R F ≤ 100Ω and the input is driven with a fast, large-\nsignal pulse (>1V), the output waveform will look as\nshown in the pulsed operation diagram (Figure 5).\nDuring the fast feedthrough-like portion of the output, the\ninput protection diodes effectively short the output to the\ninput and a current, limited only by the output short-circuit\nprotection, will be drawn by the signal generator. WithR\nF ≥ 500Ω, the output is capable of handling the current\nrequirements (I L ≤ 20mA at 10V) and the amplifier stays\nin its active mode and a smooth transition will occur.\n14LT1677\n1677faAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nFigure 6a. 0.1Hz to 10Hz Noise Test CircuitFigure 6b. 0.1Hz to 10Hz Peak-to-Peak\nNoise Tester Frequency Response1677 F06a10Ω0.1 µF\n4.7 µF\nVOLTAGE GAIN\n= 50,000\n24.3k100k–+\n–+*\nLT1677\nLT10012k\n4.3k\n110k\n100kSCOPE× 1\nR\nIN = 1M\n*DEVICE UNDER TEST  NOTE: ALL CAPACITOR VALUES ARE FOR  NONPOLARIZED CAPACITORS ONLY2.2 µF\n0.1 µF22 µF\nFREQUENCY (Hz)100\n90\n807060504030\n0.01 1 10 100\n1677 F06b0.1GAIN (dB)\nFigure 71677 F07100Ω100k–+LT1677500k\n500keno\nSOURCE RESISTANCE (k Ω)0.11101001000\n1 10 100\n1677 F08TOTAL NOISE DENSITY (nV/ √Hz)VS = ±15V\nTA = 25 °C\nSOURCE RESISTANCE = 2RR\nR\nAT 1kHz\nAT 10Hz\nRESISTOR\nNOISE ONLY\nFigure 8.

At low frequencies, thelow 1/f current noise corner frequency ( ≈90Hz) mini-\nmizes current noise to some extent.\nIn most practical applications, however, current noise will\nnot limit system performance. This is illustrated in the\nTotal Noise vs Source Resistance plot (Figure 8) where:\nTotal Noise = [(op amp voltage noise)\n2 + (resistor noise)2\n+ (current noise R S)2]1/2\nThree regions can be identified as a function of source\nresistance:\n(i) R S ≤ 400Ω.

The input common mode range for the LT1677 can\nexceed the supplies by at least 100mV. As the commonmode voltage approaches the positive rail (+V\nS – 0.7V),\nthe tail current for the input pair (Q1, Q2) is reduced,which prevents the input pair from saturating (refer to theSimplified Schematic). The voltage drop across the load\nresistors R\nC1, RC2 is reduced to less than 200mV, degrad-\ning the slew rate, bandwidth, voltage noise, offset voltage\nand input bias current (the cancellation is shut off).\nWhen the input common mode range goes below 1.5V\nabove the negative rail, the NPN input pair (Q1, Q2) shutsoff and the PNP input pair (Q8, Q9) turns on. The offset\nvoltage, input bias current, voltage noise and bandwidth\nare also degraded. The graph of Offset Voltage Shift vsCommon Mode shows where the knees occur by display-\ning the change in offset voltage. The change-over points\nare temperature dependent, see  the graph Common ModeRange vs Temperature.APPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nINPUT VOLTAGE (50µV/DIV)\n0 5 10 15 –5 –10 –1 5\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE (V)RL = 600\nFigure 9.

Voltage Gain Single SupplyRL TO 0V\n5Rail-to-Rail Output\nThe rail-to-rail output swing is achieved by using transis-\ntor collectors (Q28, Q29) instead of customary class A-B\nemitter followers for the output stage. Referring to theSimplified Schematic, the output NPN transistor (Q29) sinks\nthe current necessary to move the output in the negative\ndirection. The change in Q29’s base emitter voltage is re-flected directly to the gain node (collectors of Q20 and Q16).\nFor large sinking currents, the delta V\nBE of Q29 can domi-\nnate the gain. Figure 9 shows the change in input voltage\nfor a change in output voltage for different load resistors\nconnected between the supplies. The gain is much higher\nfor output voltages above ground (Q28 sources current)since the change in base emitter voltage of Q28 is attenu-\nated by the gain in the PNP portion of the output stage.\nTherefore, for positive output swings (output sourcingcurrent) there is hardly any change in input voltage for any\nload resistance. Highest gain and best linearity is achieved\nwhen the output is sourcing current, which is the case insingle supply operation when the load is ground referenced.\nFigure 10 shows gains for both sinking and sourcing load\ncurrents for a worst-case load of 600 Ω.\nRL = 1k\nRL = 10k\n16LT1677\n1677faMicrovolt Comparator with Hysteresis–\n+\nLT167737\n1677 TA03461\n23V\nOUTPUT\nPOSITIVE FEEDBACK TO ONE OF THE NULLING TERMINALS\nCREATES APPROXIMATELY 5 µV OF HYSTERESIS.
