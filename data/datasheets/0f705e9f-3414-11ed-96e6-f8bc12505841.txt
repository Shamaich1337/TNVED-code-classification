The exact inductor valueis generally flexible and is ultimately chosen to obtain thebest mix of cost, physical size, and circuit efficiency.Lower inductor values benefit from reduced size and costand they can improve the circuit's transient response, butthey increase the inductor ripple current and output voltageripple and reduce the efficiency due to the resulting higherpeak currents. Conversely, higher inductor values increaseefficiency, but the inductor will either be physically largeror have higher resistance since more turns of wire arerequired and transient response will be slower since moretime is required to change current (up or down) in theinductor. A good compromise between size, efficiency,and transient response is to use a ripple current (\nΔIL) about\n20% to 40% of the desired full output load current.Calculate the approximate inductor value by selecting theinput and output voltages, the switching frequency (f\nSW),\nthe maximum output current (I OUT(MAX) ) and estimating a\nΔIL as some percentage of that current.\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0b4\uf02d\n\uf0b4\uf0b4 \uf044OUT IN OUT\nIN SW LVV VL = Vf I\nOnce an inductor value is chosen, the ripple current ( ΔIL)\nis calculated to determine the required peak inductorcurrent.\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0b4\uf02d\uf044\uf0b4\uf0b4\n\uf044\uf02b\n\uf044\uf02dOUT IN OUT\nL\nIN SW\nLL(PEAK) OUT(MAX)\nLL(VALLY) OUT(MAX)VV VI=  Vf L\nII =  I2\nII =  I2\nConsidering the Typical Operating Circuit for 1.2V output\nat 2.5A and an input voltage of 12V, using an inductorripple of 1.08A (30%), the calculated inductance value is :\n\uf028\uf029 1.2 12 1.2L =  = 2 μH12 500kHz 1.08\uf0b4\uf02d\n\uf0b4\uf0b4The ripple current was selected at 1.08A and, as long as\nwe use the calculated 2 μH inductance, that should be the\nactual ripple current amount.

However, take care when thesecapacitors are used at the input of circuits supplied by awall adapter or other supply connected through long, thinwires. Current surges through the inductive wires caninduce ringing at the \nRT7294C  input which could\npotentially cause large, damaging voltage spikes at VIN.If this phenomenon is observed, some bulk inputcapacitance may be required. Ceramic capacitors (to meetthe RMS current requirement) can be placed in parallelwith other types such as tantalum, electrolytic, or polymer(to reduce ringing and overshoot).\nChoose capacitors rated at higher temperatures than\nrequired. Several ceramic capacitors may be paralleled tomeet the RMS current, size, and height requirements ofthe application. The typical operating circuit use 10 μF and\none 0.1 μF low ESR ceramic capacitors on the input.Inductor saturation current should be chosen over IC's\ncurrent limit.\nInput Capacitor Selection\nThe input filter capacitors are needed to smooth out the\nswitched current drawn from the input power source andto reduce voltage ripple on the input. The actualcapacitance value is less important than the RMS currentrating (and voltage rating, of course). The RMS input ripplecurrent (I\nRMS) is a function of the input voltage, output\nvoltage, and load current :\nRT7294C\n10DS7294C-06   October  2016 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2016 Richtek Technology Corporation. All rights reserved.                          is a registered trademark of Ric htek Technology Corporation.\nOutput Capacitor Selection\nThe RT7294C is optimized for ceramic output capacitors\nand best performance will be obtained using them. Thetotal output capacitance value is usually determined bythe desired output voltage ripple level and transient responserequirements for sag (undershoot on positive load steps)and soar (overshoot on negative load steps).\nOutput Ripple\nOutput ripple at the switching frequency is caused by theinductor current ripple and its effect on the outputcapacitor's ESR and stored charge. These two ripplecomponents are called ESR ripple and capacitive ripple.Since ceramic capacitors have extremely low ESR andrelatively little capacitance, both components are similarin amplitude and both should be considered if ripple iscritical.\n\uf02b RIPPLE RIPPLE(ESR) RIPPLE(C)V =  V V\n\uf044\uf0b4 RIPPLE(ESR) L ESRV =  I R\n\uf044\n\uf0b4\uf0b4LRIPPLE(C)\nOUT SWIV =  8C f\nOutput Transient Undershoot and Overshoot\nIn addition to voltage ripple at the switching frequency,\nthe output capacitor and its ESR also affect the voltagesag (undershoot) and soar (overshoot) when the load stepsup and down abruptly. The ACOT transient response isvery quick and output transients are usually small.\nHowever, the combination of small ceramic output\ncapacitors (with little capacitance), low output voltages(with little stored charge in the output capacitors), andlow duty cycle applications (which require high inductanceto get reasonable ripple currents with high input voltages)increases the size of voltage variations in response tovery quick load changes. Typically, load changes occurslowly with respect to the IC's 500kHz switching frequency.For the Typical Operating Circuit for 1.2V output and aninductor ripple of 1.08A, with 22 μF output capacitance each\nwith about 5m Ω ESR including PCB trace resistance, the\noutput voltage ripple components are :\nRIPPLE(ESR)\nRIPPLE(C)\nRIPPLEV  = 1.08A 5m  = 5.4mV\n1.08AV  =  = 12mV82 2μF 500kHz\nV  = 2.7mV 12mV = 14.7mV\uf0b4\uf057\n\uf0b4\uf0b4\n\uf02bBut some modern digital loads can exhibit nearly\ninstantaneous load changes and the following sectionshows how to calculate the worst-case voltage swings inresponse to very fast load steps.\nThe output voltage transient undershoot and overshoot each\nhave two components : the voltage steps caused by theoutput capacitor's ESR, and the voltage sag and soar dueto the finite output capacitance and the inductor currentslew rate. Use the following formulas to check if the ESRis low enough (typically not a problem with ceramiccapacitors) and the output capacitance is large enough toprevent excessive sag and soar on very fast load stepedges, with the chosen inductor value.\nThe amplitude of the ESR step up or down is a function of\nthe load step and the ESR of the output capacitor :\nV\nESR _STEP  = ΔIOUT x R ESR\nThe amplitude of the capacitive sag is a function of the\nload step, the output capacitor value, the inductor value,theinput-to-output voltage differential, and the maximum dutycycle. The maximum duty cycle during a fast transient isa function of the on-time and the minimum off-time sincethe ACOT\nTM control scheme will ramp the current using\non-times spaced apart with minimum off-times, which isas fast as allowed. Calculate the approximate on-time(neglecting parasitics) and maximum duty cycle for a giveninput and output voltage as :\n\uf0b4\uf02bOUT ONON MAX\nIN SW ON OFF(MIN)Vtt  =  and D  = Vf t t\nThe actual on-time will be slightly longer as the IC\ncompensates for voltage drops in the circuit, but we canneglect both of these since the on-time increasecompensates for the voltage losses.

However for high-outputvoltages, with high feedback attenuation, the circuit'sresponse becomes over-damped and transient responsecan be slowed. In high-output voltage circuits (V\nOUT > 3.3V)\ntransient response is improved by adding a small “feed-\nforward ” capacitor (C ff) across the upper FB divider resistor\n(figure 1), to increase the circuit's Q and reduce dampingto speed up the transient response without affecting thesteady-state stability of the circuit.

Its large hysteresis band\nmakes EN useful for simple delay and timing circuits. ENcan be externally pulled to V\nIN by adding a resistor-\ncapacitor delay (R EN and C EN in Figure 2). Calculate the\ndelay time using EN's internal threshold where switchingoperation begins (1.4V, typical).\nAn external MOSFET can be added to implement digital\ncontrol of EN when no system voltage above 2V is available(Figure 3). In this case, a 100k Ω pull-up resistor, R\nEN, is\nconnected between VIN and the EN pin. MOSFET Q1 willbe under logic control to pull down the EN pin. To preventenabling circuit when VIN is smaller than the VOUT targetvalue or some other desired voltage level, a resistive voltagedivider can be placed between the input voltage and groundand connected to EN to create an additional input undervoltage lockout threshold (Figure 4).\nBW\nRT7294C\nGNDFBR1\nR2VOUT\nCff\nFigure 4.

Switch turn-on is when most EMI occurs since VSWrises rapidly. During switch turn-off, SW is dischargedrelatively slowly by the inductor current during thedeadtime between high-side and low-side switch on-times.In some cases it is desirable to reduce EMI further, at theexpense of some additional power dissipation.

External Bootstrap DiodeSWBOOT5V\n0.1µF RT7294C\nOver-Temperature Protection\nThe RT7294C features an Over-Temperature Protection\n(OTP) circuitry to prevent from overheating due toexcessive power dissipation. The OTP will shut downswitching operation when junction temperature exceeds160°C. Once the junction temperature cools down by\napproximately 20 °C, the converter will resume operation.\nTo maintain continuous operation, the maximum junctiontemperature should be lower than 125 °C.\nUnder-Voltage Protection\nHiccup Mode\nThe RT7294C provides Hiccup Mode Under-Voltage\nProtection (UVP). When the VFB voltage drops below0.4V, the UVP function will be triggered to shut downswitching operation. If the UVP condition remains for aperiod, the RT7294C will retry automatically. When theUVP condition is removed, the converter will resumeoperation. The UVP is disabled during soft-start period.\nThermal Considerations\nFor continuous operation, do not exceed absolute\nmaximum junction temperature. The maximum powerdissipation depends on the thermal resistance of the ICpackage, PCB layout, rate of surrounding airflow, andturn-on can be slowed by placing a small (<47 Ω)\nresistance between BOOT and the external bootstrapcapacitor. This will slow the high-side switch turn-on andVSW's rise. To remove the resistor from the capacitorcharging path (avoiding poor enhancement due toundercharging the BOOT capacitor), use the external diodeshown in figure 6 to charge the BOOT capacitor and placethe resistance between BOOT and the capacitor/diodeconnection.\nRT7294C\n13DS7294C-06   October  2016 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2016 Richtek Technology Corporation.
