### Component Summary: LFCN-1700

**Description:**
The LFCN-1700 is a low pass filter designed for RF applications, specifically operating from DC to 1700 MHz. It is constructed using Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology, which provides excellent thermal stability and compact size. The filter is designed to handle high power levels, making it suitable for various RF applications.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; typically handled through RF power input specifications.
- **Current Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; inferred from RF power handling.
- **Power Consumption:** RF Power Input: 10W max at 25°C (derates to 3.5W at 100°C ambient).
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type:** FV1206 (ceramic package).
- **Special Features:**
  - Excellent power handling capability (10W).
  - 7-section design for improved performance.
  - Temperature stable due to LTCC construction.
  - Protected by U.S. Patent 6,943,646.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided text.

**Typical Performance Data at 25°C:**
- **Insertion Loss:** 
  - DC to 1700 MHz: Max 1.2 dB
  - Cut-off Frequency (F2): 2050 MHz, Max 3.0 dB
- **VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio):**
  - DC to 1700 MHz: Max 1.2:1
- **Stop Band Rejection Loss:**
  - 2375 MHz: Min 20 dB
  - 2500-6500 MHz: Min 30 dB
  - 7000 MHz: Min 20 dB

**Applications:**
The LFCN-1700 is typically used in:
- **Harmonic Rejection:** To filter out unwanted harmonic frequencies in RF signals.
- **VHF/UHF Transmitters/Receivers:** To ensure clean signal transmission and reception by eliminating high-frequency noise.
- **Laboratory Use:** For testing and measurement applications where precise frequency filtering is required.

This component is ideal for applications requiring reliable performance in RF signal processing, particularly in environments where temperature stability and power handling are critical.
