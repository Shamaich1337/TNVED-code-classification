Circuit design\n1.1 Operating temperature and frequency\nElectrical characteristics of the capacitor are likely to change due to variation in temperature and/or frequency.\nCircuit designers should take these changes into consideration.\n(1) Effects of operating temperature on electrical parameters\nAt higher temperatures : leakage current and capacitance increase while equivalent series resistance\n(ESR) decreases.\nAt lower temperatures : leakage current and capacitance decrease while equivalent series resistance\n(ESR) increases.\n(2) Effects of frequency on electrical parameters\nAt higher frequencies : capacitance and impedance decrease while tan d increases.\nAt lower frequencies : heat generated by ripple current will rise due to an increase in equivalent \nseries resistance (ESR).\n1.2 Operating temperature and life expectancy\n(1) Expected life is affected by operating temperature. Generally, each 10 ℃ reduction in temperature will \n double the expected life. Use capacitors at the lowest possible temperature below the upper category \n temperature.\n(2) If operating temperatures exceed the upper category limit, rapid deterioration of electrical parameter \nwill occur and irreversible damage will result.\nMeasure not only the ambient temperature but also the surface temperature of the capacitor’s case top, \nwhich has effects of ripple current and radiated heat from power transistors, IC\'s, and/or resistors. Avoid placing components, which could conduct heat to the capacitor from the back side of the circuit board.\n(3) A formula for calculating expected life is as follows ;\nL2 = L1×2 where T 1 ≧ T 2\nL1：Guaranteed life (h) at temperature, T 1 ℃\nL2：Expected life (h) at temperature, T 2 ℃\nT1：Upper category temperature (℃) for the series, GA-A, M-A, and SU-A\nUpper category temperature + temperature rise due to rated ripple current (℃) for the other series\nT2：Actual operating temperature, ambient temperature + temperature rise due to ripple current (℃)\n(4) Using the capacitor beyond the rated lifetime will result in short circuit, electrolyte leak, vent open, and large \ndeterioration of characteristics. The lifetime cannot exceed 15 years due to aging of sealing rubber. \n1.3 Load conditions to avoid\nThe following load conditions will cause rapid deterioration of capacitor’s electrical characteristics.\nIn addition, instantaneous heating and gas generation within the capacitor may cause an operation of pressure \nrelief vent, and that results in electrolyte leaks, explosion and/or fire ignition.\nThe leaked electrolyte is combustible and electrically conductive.\n(1) Reverse voltage\nDC capacitors have polarity. Therefore, do not apply the reverse voltage. Find the correct polarity before insertion.  \n(2) Charge / Discharge applications\nGeneral purpose capacitors are not suitable for use in repeating charge/discharge applications.\nFor such applications, consult a sales representative with actual application condition. Rush current must not \nexceed 100 A.\n(3) ON-OFF circuit\nWhen using capacitors in circuit where ON-OFF switching is repeated more than 10,000 times a day,\nconsult a sales representative with actual application condition for an appropriate choice of capacitors.\n(4) Over voltage\nDo not apply a voltage exceeding the rated voltage. The rated surge voltage can be applied only for a short time.\u3000\u3000\nMake sure that a sum of the DC voltage and the superimposed AC ripple voltage does not exceed the rated voltage.\n01-Oct-21\u3000\u3000Application guidelines（Radial lead Type）\nT1-T2\n10\n\nAluminum Electrolytic Capacitors (Radial lead Type)\n(5) Ripple current\nDo not apply ripple currents exceeding the rated value.  \nMake sure that rated ripple currents superimposed on low DC bias voltages do not cause reverse voltage \nconditions. Even if the current is below the rated ripple current, using the capacitor for longer than the rated lifetime will cause ESR increase and internal generation of heat, which may eventually lead to vent open, \nbulging of case/rubber, electrolyte leak, short circuit, explosion, or ignition in the worst case.\n1.4  Connections in series or parallel\n(1) Capacitors connected in parallel\nBecause the impedance of the capacitor and PCB’s wiring are very close, various impedance values may cause \nunbalanced ripple current loads among parallel capacitors.  Combine the same part number and wire them \ncarefully to minimize the potential risk of an excessive ripple current concentrating to one capacitor of the smallest\nimpedance. \n(2) Capacitors connected in series\nVoltage being applied to each capacitor must be smaller than the rated voltage.  Unbalanced voltages to the series \ncapacitors may exceed the rated voltage.  Voltage-divider resistors considering leakage currents could prevent the \nover-voltage to the series capacitors. Conductive polymer hybrid aluminum electrolytic capacitors are not allowed \nto be connected in series.\n1.5 Capacitor mounting considerations\n(1) For double sided circuit boards, avoid wiring patterns passing between the mounted capacitor and the circuit \nboard. When a radial lead type capacitor is dipped into a solder bath, an excess solder may deposit under the capacitor by capillary action, causing short circuit between anode and cathode terminals. Also, lead holes must be placed with special care for radial lead type capacitors because laminate on capacitor’s surface may become \ndamaged during flow process. \n(2) The pitch between circuit board holes should match the lead wire pitch of the radial lead type capacitors within \nthe specified tolerances.  Unmatched pitch may cause an excessive stress on lead wires during the insertion process and result in short/open circuit, increased leakage current, or electrolyte leak.\n(3) Clearance for case mounted pressure relief\nCapacitors with case mounted pressure relief require sufficient clearance to allow for proper pressure relief \noperation. The minimum clearance are dependent on capacitor diameters as follows.\n(Ø 10 mm to Ø 16 mm: 2 mm minimum, Ø 18 mm: 3 mm minimum)\n(4) Wiring near the pressure relief\nAvoid locating high voltage or high current wiring or circuit board paths above the pressure relief. Flammable, \nhigh temperature gas that exceeds 100 ℃ may be released which could dissolve the wire insulation and ignite.\n(5) Circuit board patterns under the capacitor\nAvoid circuit board runs under the capacitor, as an electrical short can occur due to an electrolyte leakage.\n(6) Resonant vibration after circuit board’s production may make a heavy load on the capacitor and cause rapid \nchange in characteristics and/or capacitor’s break. \n1.6 Electrical isolation\nElectrically isolate the capacitor’s case from cathode terminals, as well as circuit patterns. \n1.7 Capacitor sleeve and coating\nThe vinyl sleeve or laminate coating is intended for marking and identification purposes and is not meant to electrically insulate the capacitor.\nThe sleeve may split or crack if immersed into solvents such as toluene or xylene and then subsequentlyexposed to high temperatures.\n2. Capacitor handling techniques\n2.1 Considerations before using\n(1) Capacitors have a finite life. Do not reuse or recycle capacitors from used equipment.\n(2) Transient recovery voltage may be generated in the capacitor due to dielectric absorption.\n If required, this voltage can be discharged with a resistor with a value of about 1 kΩ.\n(3) Capacitors stored for a long period of time may exhibit an increase in leakage current.\n This can be corrected by gradually applying rated voltage in series with a resistor of approximately 1 kΩ.\n(4) If capacitors are dropped, they can be damaged mechanically or electrically. Avoid using dropped\n capacitors.\n(5) Dented or crushed capacitors should not be used.\n The seal integrity can be damaged and loss of electrolyte/ shortened life can result.\n01-Oct-21\n\nAluminum Electrolytic Capacitors (Radial lead Type)\n2.2 Capacitor insertion\n(1) Verify the correct capacitance and rated voltage of the capacitor.\n(2) Verify the correct polarity of the capacitor before insertion.(3) Verify the correct terminal dimension and land pattern size for surface mount type, or holes’ pitch for radial\nlead type before mount to avoid short circuit, stress on the terminals, and/or lack of terminal strength.\n(4) Excessive mounting pressure can cause high leakage current, short circuit, or disconnection.(5) When using a mounter for radial lead type, avoid cutter wear and acute angle of lead-bending with respect to \ncircuit board. That may create excessive stress and pull the lead to damage the capacitor. \n2.3 Reflow soldering (for surface mount type)\n(1) Surface-mount type capacitor are exclusively for reflow soldering.\n\u3000When reflow solder is used an ambient heat condition system such as the simultaneous use of infrared\u3000and hot-air is recommended.\n(2) Observe proper soldering conditions (temperature, time, etc.). Do not exceed the specified limits.\n If the peak temperature is high or if the heating time is long, it may cause deterioration of the electrical  characteristics and life characteristics.\n Recommended soldering condition is a guideline for ensuring the basic characteristics of the components, \n but not for the stable soldering conditions. Conditions for proper soldering should be set up according to \n individual onditions.\n\u3000・ The Temperature on Capacitor top shall be measured by using thermal couple that is fixed firmly by\n epoxy glue.\n(3) In case of use in 2 times reflow, 2nd reflow must be done when the capacitor’s temperature return back\n\u3000to normal level.\n(4) In our recommended reflow condition , the case discoloration and the case swelling might be slightly \n\u3000generated. But please acknowledge that these two phenomena do not influence the reliability of the product. \n(5) The crack on top marking might be occurred by reflow heat stress.\n\u3000But please acknowledge that it does not influence the reliability of the product.\n(6) VPS (Vapor Phase Soldering) reflow can cause significant characteristics change and/ or mounting failure\n\u3000due to deformation by acute temperature rise.\n\u3000VPS is acceptable provided that the process does not exceed recommended reflow profile and\n\u3000temperature rise is less than 3 ℃/sec.\n\u3000Please contact Panasonic for detailed conditions.\n(7) The vibration-proof capacitors of size ø6.3 has support terminals extending from the bottom side to the lead edge.\n Then, make sure to find appropriate soldering conditions to form fillet on the support terminals if required for \n appearance inspection. However, even if sufficient solder fillets are not observed, the reliability of \n vibration-proof  will not be lowered because the support terminals on the bottom side enhance the solder \n joint to PCB.\n2.4 Flow soldering\n(1) Radial lead type capacitors cannot apply to reflow soldering.\n(2) Do not immerse the capacitor body into the solder bath as excessive internal pressure could result.\n(3) Apply proper soldering conditions (temperature, time, etc.). Do not exceed the specified limits.(4) Do not allow other parts or components to touch the capacitor during soldering.\n2.5 Manual soldering\n(1) Apply soldering conditions (temperature and time) based on the specification, or do not exceed temperature \nof 350 ℃ for 3 seconds.\n(2) If a soldered capacitor must be removed and reinserted, avoid excessive stress on the capacitor leads.(3) Avoid physical contacts between the tip of the soldering iron and capacitors to prevent or capacitor failure.(4) When bending lead wires of radial type capacitors to match the hole pitch on PCB, avoid applying excessive \nstress to the capacitor body.\n2.6 Other soldering considerations\nRapid temperature rise during the preheat operation and resin bonding operation can cause cracking of the capacitor’s vinyl sleeve. For heat curing, do not exceed 150 ℃ for the maximum time of 2 minutes.\n2.7 Capacitor handling after soldering\n(1) Avoid moving the capacitor after soldering to prevent excessive stress on the lead wires where they enter \n the seal. The capacitor may break from element portion due to a torque at outer rim, causing a large stress to terminals.\n(2) Do not use the capacitor as a handle when moving the circuit board assembly. The total weight of the\n board would apply to element portion through terminals, and the capacitor may break.\n(3) Avoid striking the capacitor after assembly to prevent failure due to excessive shock. The capacitor may\n break due to excessive shock or load above specified range.\n01-Oct-21\n\nAluminum Electrolytic Capacitors (Radial lead Type)\n2.8 Circuit board cleaning\n(1) Circuit boards can be immersed or ultrasonically cleaned using suitable cleaning solvents for up to \n 5 minutes and up to 60 ℃ maximum temperatures. The boards should be thoroughly rinsed and dried.\n The use of ozone depleting cleaning agents is not recommended for the purpose of protecting our  environment.【Target solvent】\nPine Alpha ST-100S, Aqua Cleaner 210SEP, Clean-thru 750H / 750L / 710M, Sunelec B-12, \nSunelec B-12, Cold Cleaner P3-375, Techno Cleaner 219, DK Be-clear CW-5790, \nTelpene Cleaner EC-7R, Technocare FRW-17 / FRW-1 / FRV-1\n(2) Avoid using the following solvent groups unless specifically allowed in the specification ;\n(a) Halogenated based solvents ： may permeate the seal and cause internal corrosion.\nEspecially, 1-1-1 trichloroethane must not be used on any aluminum electrolytic capacitors. \n(b) Alkaline  based solvents ： may dissolve and react to the aluminum case.\n(c) Petroleum based solvents ： may deteriorate the sealing rubber.\n(d) Xylene ： may deteriorate the sealing rubber. \n(e) Acetone ： may erase the markings.\n(3) A thorough drying after cleaning is required to remove residual cleaning solvents that may be trapped\n between the capacitor and the circuit board. Avoid drying temperatures, which exceed the upper category\n temperature of the capacitor.\n(4) Monitor the contamination levels of the cleaning solvents during use in terms of electrical conductivity, \npH, specific gravity, and water content.  Inside the capacitor may corrode with high density of chlorine. \nControl the flux density in the cleaning agent to be less than 2 mass%. \n(5) Depending on the cleaning method, the marking on a capacitor may be erased or blurred.※ Please consult us if you are not certain about acceptable cleaning solvents or cleaning methods.\n2.9 Mounting adhesives and coating agents\nWhen using mounting adhesives or coating agents to control humidity, avoid using materials containinghalogenated solvents. Also, avoid the use of chloroprene based polymers.Cure or dry out the coating agents thoroughly, and do not leave any solvents.  Make sure to dry out cleaning agents \ncompletely immediately after washing the circuit board if the capacitors are mounted afterward, so that the solvents \nare not left under the capacitor body.  Also, leave more than 1/3 of the sealing portion open, and do not cover that \nportion with any adhesives or coating.\n2.10 Potting and molding\nPotting and molding processes cannot be recommended. They have potential risks to change the capacitor’s \nperformance and reliability due to injection pressure, diffused material into the capacitor, as well as heat accumulation by covered resin. Also, evaporated electrolyte may remain inside the resin, then turn to liquid, and possibly short circuit PCB patterns. \n2.11 Fumigation\nIn exporting electronic appliances with aluminum electrolytic capacitors, in some cases fumigation treatmentusing such halogen compound as methyl bromide is conducted for wooden boxes.If such boxes are not dried well, the halogen left in the box is dispersed while transported and enters in the\ncapacitors inside. This possibly causes electrical corrosion of the capacitors. Therefore, after performing fumigation \nand drying make sure that no halogen is left. Don’t perform fumigation treatment to the whole electronic appliances packed in a box.\n2.12 Flux\nIf you use a halogen type (Chlorine type, Bromine type, etc.)  high-activity flux, please use it after confirmation \nin advance, as it may have an impact on performance and reliability of this product due to the residue of the flux.\n3. Precautions for using capacitors\n3.1 Environmental conditions\nCapacitors should not be stored or used in the following environments.\n(1) Exposure to temperatures above the upper category or below the lower category temperature of the capacitor.\n(2) Direct contact with water, salt water, or oil.\n(3) High humidity conditions where water could condense on the capacitor.\n(4) Exposure to toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, chlorine, chlorine compound,\n bromine, bromine compound or ammonia.\n(5) Exposure to ozone, radiation, or ultraviolet rays.\n(6) Vibration and shock conditions exceeding specified requirements.\n Even within the specified requirements, a large vibration acceleration may be applied due to resonance, \n so be sure to evaluate and confirm with the actual product.\n01-Oct-21\n\nAluminum Electrolytic Capacitors (Radial lead Type)\n3.2 Electrical precautions\n(1) Avoid touching the terminals of a capacitor as a possible electric shock could result. The exposed\n aluminum case is not insulated and could also cause electric shock if touched.\n(2) Avoid short circuiting the area between the capacitor terminals with conductive materials including liquids\n such as acids or alkaline solutions.\n(3) A low-molecular-weight-shiroxane which is included in a silicon material shall causes abnormal electrical\n characteristics.\n4. Emergency procedures\n(1) If the pressure relief of the capacitor operates, immediately turn off the equipment and disconnect from \n the power source.\n This will minimize an additional damage caused by the vaporizing electrolyte.\n(2) Avoid contact with the escaping electrolyte gas, which can exceed 100 ℃ temperatures.\n If electrolyte or gas enters the eye, immediately flush the eye with large amounts of water.\n If electrolyte or gas is ingested by mouth, gargle with water. If electrolyte contacts the skin, wash with soap and water.\n5. Long term storage\n(1) Leakage current of a capacitor tends to increase after a long-term storage due to dielectric dissolution, and very\nhigh current may flow at the first voltage load. However, applying voltage will form the dielectric, and the leakage \ncurrent will decrease.\u3000Expiration date is 42 months from outgoing inspection date for part numbers listed below, and it is 12 month for part numbers not listed below.\nStorage condition is to keep in room temperature (5 ℃ to 35 ℃) and humidity (45 % to 85 %) with no \ndirect sunshine.\n（2）Environmental Conditions\nDo not store under condition outside the area described in the specification, and also under conditions listed\nbelow.\n(a) Exposure to temperatures above the upper category or below the lower category temperature of the\ncapacitor.\n(b) Direct contact with water, salt water, or oil.\n(c) High humidity conditions where water could condense on the capacitor.\n(d) Exposure to toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, chlorine, Chlorine compound,\nBromine, Bromine compound or ammonia.\n(e) Exposure to ozone, radiation, or ultraviolet rays.\n(f) Vibration and shock conditions exceeding specified requirements.\n6. Capacitor disposal\nWhen disposing capacitors, use one of the following methods.\n(1) Incinerate after crushing the capacitor or puncturing the can wall (to prevent explosion due to internal\npressure rise).\n(2) Dispose as solid waste.\nNOTE : Local laws may have specific disposal requirements which must be followed.\n■ AEC-Q200\u3000compliant\nThe products are tested based on all or part of the test conditions and methods defined in AEC-Q200.\nPlease consult with Panasonic for the details of the product specification and specific evaluation test results, \netc., and please review and approve Panasonic\'s product specification before ordering.\n01-Oct-21FC-A, FK-A, HD-A, TA-A, TP-ASeries\n42 months from outgoing\ninspection dateExpiration date\nThe precautions in using aluminum electrolytic capacitors follow the "Safety application guide \nfor the use in fixedaluminum electrolytic capacitors for electronic equipment", RCR -2367D \nissued by JEITA in October 2017.Please refer to the above application guide for details.\n\nMouser Electronics\n  \nAuthorized Distributor\n \n  \nClick to View Pricing, Inventory, Delivery & Lifecycle Information:\n \n \n \n Panasonic:   \n\xa0 EEU-FR1E471\xa0 EEU-FR0J151\xa0 EEU-FR1A151\xa0 EEU-FR1A221\xa0 EEU-FR1A682L\xa0 EEU-FR1C101\xa0 EEU-FR1C121\xa0\nEEU-FR1C182L\xa0 EEU-FR1C221\xa0 EEU-FR1C392S\xa0 EEU-FR1C472L\xa0 EEU-FR1C562\xa0 EEU-FR1C680\xa0 EEU-FR1C681\xa0\nEEU-FR1E122L\xa0 EEU-FR1E151\xa0 EEU-FR1E272S\xa0 EEU-FR1E680\xa0 EEU-FR1E681\xa0 EEU-FR1E681L\xa0 EEU-FR1H220\xa0\nEEU-FR1H560\xa0 EEU-FR1V222L\xa0 EEU-FR1V330\xa0 EEU-FR1V471L\xa0 EEU-FR1V680\xa0 EEU-FR1V821L\xa0 EEU-FR1V681\xa0\nEEU-FR1V681B\xa0 EEU-FR0J122\xa0 EEU-FR0J152L\xa0 EEU-FR0J222\xa0 EEU-FR1A101\xa0 EEU-FR1A102L\xa0 EEU-FR1C102\xa0\nEEU-FR1C222\xa0 EEU-FR1C332L\xa0 EEU-FR1C471\xa0 EEU-FR1E102L\xa0 EEU-FR1E222L\xa0 EEU-FR1E331\xa0 EEU-FR1H101\xa0\nEEU-FR1H102\xa0 EEU-FR1H221\xa0 EEU-FR1H331L\xa0 EEU-FR1H471\xa0 EEU-FR1V102\xa0 EEU-FR1V152L\xa0 EEU-FR1V471\xa0\nEEU-FR0J122L\xa0 EEU-FR0J182\xa0 EEU-FR0J272L\xa0 EEU-FR0J392\xa0 EEU-FR0J472\xa0 EEU-FR0J562L\xa0 EEU-FR0J682L\xa0\nEEU-FR0J682S\xa0 EEU-FR0J821\xa0 EEU-FR0J822\xa0 EEU-FR1A152\xa0 EEU-FR1A152L\xa0 EEU-FR1A182\xa0 EEU-FR1A222L\xa0\nEEU-FR1A332\xa0 EEU-FR1A392\xa0 EEU-FR1A472L\xa0 EEU-FR1A472S\xa0 EEU-FR1A562L\xa0 EEU-FR1A681\xa0 EEU-FR1A682\xa0\nEEU-FR1A821\xa0 EEU-FR1C102L\xa0 EEU-FR1C152\xa0 EEU-FR1C152L\xa0 EEU-FR1C272\xa0 EEU-FR1C332S\xa0 EEU-FR1C392L\xa0\nEEU-FR1C472\xa0 EEU-FR1C681L\xa0 EEU-FR1E152\xa0 EEU-FR1E182\xa0 EEU-FR1E222S\xa0 EEU-FR1E272L\xa0 EEU-FR1E332\xa0\nEEU-FR1E391L\xa0 EEU-FR1E561L\xa0 EEU-FR1E821\xa0 EEU-FR1H121L\xa0 EEU-FR1H181L\xa0 EEU-FR1H271\xa0 EEU-FR1H561\xa0\nEEU-FR1H681L\xa0 EEU-FR1H821L\xa0 EEU-FR1H821S\xa0 EEU-FR1V122\xa0 EEU-FR1V152S\xa0 EEU-FR1V181\xa0 EEU-FR1V182L\n\xa0 EEU-FR1V222\xa0 EEU-FR1V561\n'}]
