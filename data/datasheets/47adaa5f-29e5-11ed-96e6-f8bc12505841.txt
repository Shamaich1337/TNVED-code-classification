The charger employs a 3.3V float voltage feedback reference, so any desired battery float voltage up to 18V can be programmed with a resistor divider.\nThe LT3652HV employs an input voltage regulation loop, \nwhich reduces charge current if the input voltage falls below a programmed level, set with a resistor divider. When the LT3652HV is powered by a solar panel, the input regulation loop is used to maintain the panel at peak output power.\nThe LT3652HV can be configured to terminate charging when \ncharge current falls below 1/10 of the programmed maximum (C/10). Once charging is terminated, the LT3652HV enters a low-current (85µA) standby mode. An auto-recharge feature starts a new charging cycle if the battery voltage falls 2.5% below the programmed float voltage. The LT3652HV also contains a programmable safety timer, used to terminate charging after a desired time is reached. This allows top-off \ncharging at currents less than C/10.

V IN operating range \nis 4.95V to 34V. V IN must be 3.3V greater than the pro -\ngrammed output battery float voltage (V BAT(FLT) ) for reli -\nable start-up. (V IN – V BAT(FLT) ) ≥ 0.75V is the minimum \noperating voltage, provided (V BOOST  – V SW) ≥ 2V. I VIN ~ \n85µA after charge termination. This pin is typically con -\nnected to the cathode of a blocking diode.\nVIN_REG  (Pin 2): Input Voltage Regulation Reference. Maxi -\nmum charge current is reduced when this pin is below 2.7V. \nConnecting a resistor divider from V IN to this pin enables \nprogramming of minimum operational V IN voltage. This \nis typically used to program the peak power voltage for a \nsolar panel. The LT3652HV servos the maximum charge \ncurrent required to maintain the programmed operational V\nIN voltage, through maintaining the voltage on V IN_REG \nat or above 2.7V. If the voltage regulation feature is not used, connect the pin to V\nIN.\nSHDN (Pin 3): Precision Threshold Shutdown Pin. The \nenable threshold is 1.2V (rising), with 120mV of input \nhysteresis. When in shutdown mode, all charging functions are disabled. The precision threshold allows use of the \nSHDN  pin to incorporate UVLO functions. If the SHDN  pin \nis pulled below 0.4V, the IC enters a low current shutdown \nmode where V\nIN current is reduced to 15µA. Typical SHDN  \npin input bias current is 10nA. If the shutdown function \nis not desired, connect the pin to V IN.\nCHRG (Pin 4): Open-Collector Charger Status Output; typically pulled up through a resistor to a reference volt\n-\nage. This status pin can be pulled up to voltages as high \nas V IN when disabled, and can sink currents up to 10mA \nwhen enabled. During a battery charging cycle, if required \ncharge current is greater than 1/10 of the programmed \nmaximum current (C/10), CHRG is pulled low. A tem -\nperature fault also causes this pin to be pulled low. After C/10 charge termination or, if the internal timer is used \nfor termination and charge current is less than C/10, the \nCHRG pin remains high-impedance.\nFAULT  (Pin 5): Open-Collector Charger Status Output; \ntypically pulled up through a resistor to a reference volt\n-\nage. This status pin can be pulled up to voltages as high \nas V IN when disabled, and can sink currents up to 10mA \nwhen enabled. This pin indicates fault conditions during a battery charging cycle. A temperature fault causes this pin to be pulled low. If the internal timer is used for termina\n-\ntion, a bad battery fault also causes this pin to be pulled low. If no fault conditions exist, the FAULT  pin remains \nhigh-impedance.\nTIMER (Pin 6): End-Of-Cycle Timer Programming Pin. \nIf a timer-based charge termination is desired, connect \na capacitor from this pin to ground. Full charge end-of-\ncycle time (in hours) is programmed with this capacitor following the equation:\n t\nEOC = C TIMER  • 4.4 • 106\nA bad battery fault is generated if the battery does not \nachieve the precondition threshold voltage within one-\neighth of t EOC, or:\n tPRE = C TIMER  • 5.5 • 105\nA 0.68µF capacitor is typically used, which generates a \ntimer EOC at three hours, and a precondition limit time of \n22.5 minutes. If a timer-based termination is not desired, \nthe timer function is disabled by connecting the TIMER pin to ground. With the timer function disabled, charging \nterminates when the charge current drops below a C/10 \nthreshold, or I\nCHG(MAX) /10\nVFB (Pin 7): Battery Float Voltage Feedback Reference.  The \ncharge function operates to achieve a final float voltage of \n3.3V on this pin. Output battery float voltage (V BAT(FLT) ) \nis programmed using a resistor divider. V BAT(FLT)  can be \nprogrammed up to 18V.\nThe auto-restart feature initiates a new charging cycle \nwhen the voltage at the V FB pin falls 2.5% below the float \nvoltage reference.\nThe V FB pin input bias current is 110nA. Using a resistor \ndivider with an equivalent input resistance at the V FB pin \nof 250k compensates for input bias current error.Required resistor values to program desired V\nBAT(FLT)  \nfollow the equations: R1 = (V\nBAT(FLT)  • 2.5 • 105)/3.3 (Ω)\n R2 = (R1 • 2.5 • 105)/(R1 - (2.5 • 105)) (Ω)\nR1 is connected from BAT to V FB, and R2 is connected \nfrom V FB to ground.\nLT3652HV8\n3652hvfb For more information www.linear.com/LT3652HVNTC (Pin 8): Battery Temperature Monitor Pin. This pin is \nthe input to the NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) \nthermistor temperature monitoring circuit. This function is \nenabled by connecting a 10kΩ, B = 3380 NTC thermistor from the NTC pin to ground. The pin sources 50µA, and \nmonitors the voltage across the 10kΩ thermistor. When \nthe voltage on this pin is above 1.36 (T < 0°C) or below 0.29V (T > 40°C), charging is disabled and the CHRG and \nFAULT  pins are both pulled low. If internal timer termina\n-\ntion is being used, the timer is paused, suspending the charging cycle. Charging resumes when the voltage on NTC \nreturns to within the 0.29V to 1.36V active region. There \nis approximately 5°C of temperature hysteresis associated with each of the temperature thresholds. The temperature \nmonitoring function remains enabled while the thermistor \nresistance to ground is less than 250k, so if this function is not desired, leave the NTC pin unconnected.\nBAT (Pin 9): Charger Output Monitor Pin. Connect a \n10µF decoupling capacitance (C\nBAT) to ground. Depend -\ning on application requirements, larger value decoupling capacitors may be required. The charge function operates \nto achieve the programmed output battery float voltage \n(V\nBAT(FLT) ) at this pin. This pin is also the reference for \nthe current sense voltage. Once a charge cycle is termi -\nnated, the input bias current of the BAT pin is reduced to < 0.1µA, to minimize battery discharge while the charger \nremains connected.\nSENSE (Pin 10): Charge Current Sense Pin. Connect the \ninductor sense resistor (R\nSENSE ) from the SENSE pin to the \nBAT pin. The voltage across this resistor sets the average charge current. The maximum charge current (I CHG(MAX) )  \ncorresponds to 100mV across the sense resistor. This resistor can be set to program maximum charge cur\n-\nrent as high as 2A. The sense resistor value follows the relation:\n R\nSENSE  = 0.1/I CHG(MAX)  (Ω)\nOnce a charge cycle is terminated, the input bias current of \nthe SENSE pin is reduced to < 0.1µA, to minimize battery \ndischarge while the charger remains connected.\nBOOST (Pin 11): Bootstrapped Supply Rail for Switch \nDrive. This pin facilitates saturation of the switch transistor. \nConnect a 1µF or greater capacitor from the BOOST pin to the SW pin. Operating range of this pin is 0V to 8.5V, \nreferenced to the SW pin. The voltage on the decoupling \ncapacitor is refreshed through a rectifying diode, with the anode connected to either the battery output voltage \nor an external source, and the cathode connected to the \nBOOST pin.\nSW (Pin 12): Switch Output Pin. This pin is the output \nof the charger switch, and corresponds to the emitter of \nthe switch transistor. When enabled, the switch shorts the SW pin to the V\nIN supply.

The IC uses a 1MHz constant fre\n-\nquency, average-current mode step-down architecture.\nThe L T3652HV incorporates a 2A switch that is driven \nby a bootstrapped supply to maximize efficiency during charging cycles. Wide input range allows operation to full charge from voltages as high as 34V . A precision threshold \nshutdown pin allows incorporation of UVLO functionality \nusing a simple resistor divider . The IC can also be put into \na low-current shutdown mode, in which the input supply \nbias is reduced to only 15µA.\nThe L T3652HV employs an input voltage regulation loop, \nwhich reduces charge current if a monitored input voltage \nfalls below a programmed level. When the L T3652HV is \npowered by a solar panel, the input regulation loop is used \nto maintain the panel at peak output power .\nThe L T3652HV automatically enters a battery precondition \nmode if the sensed battery voltage is very low. In this mode, \nthe charge current is reduced to 15% of the programmed \nmaximum, as set by the inductor sense resistor , R\nSENSE . \nOnce the battery voltage reaches 70% of the fully charged \nfloat voltage, the IC automatically increases maximum charge current to the full programmed value.\nThe L T3652HV can use a charge-current based C/10 \ntermination scheme, which ends a charge cycle when the battery charge current falls to one tenth of the pro\n-\ngrammed maximum charge current. The L T3652HV also contains an internal charge cycle control timer , for timer-based termination. When using the internal timer , the IC combines C/10 detection with a programmable time constraint, during which the charging cycle can continue beyond the C/10 level to top-off  a battery. The charge \ncycle terminates when a specific time elapses, typically 3 hours. When the timer-based scheme is used, the IC also supports bad battery detection, which triggers a system fault if a battery stays in precondition mode for more than one eighth of the total charge cycle time.\nOnce charging is terminated, the L T3652HV automati\n-\ncally enters a low-current standby mode where supply \nbias currents are reduced to 85µA. The IC continues to monitor the battery voltage while in standby, and if that voltage falls 2.5% from the full-charge float voltage, the L T3652HV engages an automatic charge cycle restart. The IC also automatically restarts a new charge cycle after a bad battery fault once the failed battery is removed and replaced with another battery.\nThe L T3652HV contains provisions for a battery tem\n-\nperature monitoring circuit. This feature monitors battery \ntemperature using a thermistor during the charging cycle. If the battery temperature moves outside a safe charg\n-\ning range of 0°C to 40°C, the IC suspends charging and signals a fault condition until the temperature returns to the safe charging range.\nThe L T3652HV contains two digital open-collector outputs, \nwhich provide charger status and signal fault conditions. These binary-coded pins signal battery charging, standby or shutdown modes, battery temperature faults, and bad battery faults.\nGeneral Operation (See Block Diagram)\nThe L T3652HV uses average current mode control loop \narchitecture, such that the IC servos directly to average charge current. The L T3652HV senses charger output voltage through a resistor divider via the V\nFB pin. The \ndifference between the voltage on this pin and an internal 3.3V voltage reference is integrated by the voltage error amplifier (V-EA). This amplifier generates an error volt\n-\nage on its output (I TH), which corresponds to the average \ncurrent sensed across the inductor current sense resistor , R\nSENSE , which is connected between the SENSE and BAT \npins. The I TH voltage is then divided down by a factor of \n10, and imposed on the input of the current error amplifier (C-EA). The difference between this imposed voltage and the current sense resistor voltage is integrated, with the resulting voltage (V\nC) used as a threshold that is compared \nagainst an internally generated ramp. The output of this comparison controls the charger’s switch.\nThe I\nTH error voltage corresponds linearly to average \ncurrent sensed across the inductor current sense resistor , \nallowing maximum charge current control by limiting the effective voltage range of I\nTH. A clamp limits this voltage \nto 1V which, in turn, limits the current sense voltage to 100mV . This sets the maximum charge current, or the current delivered while the charger is operating in con\n-\nLT3652HV11\n3652hvfb For more information www.linear.com/LT3652HVAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nstant-current (CC) mode, which corresponds to 100mV \nacross R SENSE . The I TH voltage is pulled down to reduce \nthis maximum charge current should the voltage on the V\nIN_REG  pin falls below 2.7V (V IN_REG(TH) ) or the die tem -\nperature approaches 125°C.\nIf the voltage on the V FB pin is below 2.3V (V FB(PRE) ), \nthe L T3652HV engages precondition mode. During the \nprecondition interval, the charger continues to operate in \nconstant-current mode, but the maximum charge current is reduced to 15% of the maximum programmed value \nas set by R\nSENSE .\nWhen the charger output voltage approaches the float volt -\nage, or the voltage on the V FB pin approaches 3.3V (V FB(FL T) ), \nthe charger transitions into constant-voltage (CV) mode and charge current is reduced from the maximum value. \nAs this occurs, the I\nTH voltage falls from the limit clamp \nand servos to lower voltages. The IC monitors the I TH volt-\nage as it is reduced, and detection of C/10 charge current is achieved when I\nTH = 0.1V . If the charger is configured \nfor C/10 termination, this threshold is used to terminate \nthe charge cycle. Once the charge cycle is terminated, \nthe CHRG status pin becomes high-impedance and the \ncharger enters low-current standby mode.\nThe L T3652HV contains an internal charge cycle timer that \nterminates a successful charge cycle after a programmed amount of time. This timer is typically programmed to \nachieve end-of-cycle (EOC) in 3 hours, but can be con\n-\nfigured for any amount of time by setting an appropriate \ntiming capacitor value (C TIMER ). When timer termination \nis used, the charge cycle does not terminate when C/10 \nis achieved. Because the CHRG status pin responds to \nthe C/10 current level, the IC will indicate a fully-charged battery status, but the charger continues to source low \ncurrents into the battery until the programmed EOC time \nhas elapsed, at which time the charge cycle will terminate. At EOC when the charging cycle terminates, if the battery did not achieve at least 97.5% of the full float voltage, charging \nis deemed unsuccessful, the L T3652HV re-initiates, and \ncharging continues for another full timer cycle.\nUse of the timer function also enables bad-battery detec\n-\ntion. This fault condition is achieved if the battery does \nnot respond to preconditioning, such that the charger remains in (or enters) precondition mode after 1/8th of the programmed charge cycle time. A bad battery fault \nhalts the charging cycle, the CHRG status pin goes high-\nimpedance, and the FAULT pin is pulled low.\nWhen the L T3652HV terminates a charging cycle, whether \nthrough C/10 detection or by reaching timer EOC, the \naverage current mode analog loop remains active, but the internal float voltage reference is reduced by 2.5%. \nBecause the voltage on a successfully charged battery is \nat the full float voltage, the voltage error amp detects an over-voltage condition and I\nTH is pulled low. When the \nvoltage error amp output drops below 0.3V , the IC enters \nstandby mode, where most of the internal circuitry is dis -\nabled, and the V IN bias current is reduced to 85µA. When \nthe voltage on the V FB pin drops below the reduced float \nreference level, the output of the voltage error amp will climb, at which point the IC comes out of standby mode \nand a new charging cycle is initiated.\nV\nIN Input Supply\nThe L T3652HV is biased through a reverse-current block -\ning element from the charger input supply to the V IN pin. \nThis supply provides large switched currents, so a high-\nquality, low ESR decoupling capacitor is recommended \nto minimize voltage glitches on V IN. The V IN decoupling \ncapacitor (C VIN) absorbs all input switching ripple current \nin the charger , so it must have an adequate ripple current \nrating. RMS ripple current (I CVIN(RMS) ) is:\n ICVIN(RMS)  ≅ ICHG(MAX)  • (VBAT / VIN)•([V IN /VBAT] – 1)1/2,\nwhere I CHG(MAX)  is the maximum average charge current \n(100mV/R SENSE ). The above relation has a maximum at \nVIN = 2 • V BAT, where:\n ICVIN(RMS)  = ICHG(MAX) /2.\nThe simple worst-case of ½ • I CHG(MAX)  is commonly \nused for design.\nLT3652HV12\n3652hvfb For more information www.linear.com/LT3652HVBulk capacitance is a function of desired input ripple volt -\nage (ΔV IN), and follows the relation:\n C IN(BULK)  = ICHG(MAX)  • (V BAT/VIN)/ΔVIN (µF)\nInput ripple voltages above 0.1V are not recommended. \n10µF is typically adequate for most charger applica -\ntions.\nCharge Current Programming\nThe L T3652HV charger is configurable to charge at aver -\nage currents as high as 2A. Maximum charge current is \nset by choosing an inductor sense resistor (R SENSE ) such \nthat the desired maximum average current through that \nsense resistor creates a 100mV drop, or:\n R SENSE  = 0.1/I CHG(MAX)\nwhere ICHG(MAX)  is the maximum average charge cur -\nrent. A 2A charger , for example, would use a 0.05Ω sense \nresistor .\nBOOST Supply\nThe BOOST bootstrapped supply rail drives the internal \nswitch and facilitates saturation of the switch transistor . \nOperating range of the BOOST pin is 0V to 8.5V , as refer -\nenced to the SW pin. Connect a 1µF or greater capacitor \nfrom the BOOST pin to the SW pin.The voltage on the decoupling capacitor is refreshed \nthrough a diode, with the anode connected to either the \nbattery output voltage or an external source, and the cathode connected to the BOOST pin. Rate the diode \naverage current greater than 0.1A, and reverse voltage \ngreater than V\nIN(MAX) .\nTo refresh the decoupling capacitor with a rectifying diode \nfrom the battery with battery float voltages higher than \n8.4V , a >100mA Zener diode can be put in series with the rectifying diode to prevent exceeding the BOOST pin \noperating voltage range.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 1.

If there is no BOOST supply available, the internal switch requires (V\nIN – VSW) ≥ 3.3V \nto reliably operate. This requirement does not exist if the \nBOOST supply is available and (V BOOST  – VSW) > 2V .\nWhen an L T3652HV charger is not switching, the SW pin is at the same potential as the battery, which can be as \nhigh as V\nBAT(FL T) . As such, for reliable start-up, the V IN \nsupply must be at least 3.3V above V BAT(FL T) . Once switch -\ning begins and the BOOST supply capacitor gets charged such that (V\nBOOST  – V SW) > 2V , the V IN requirement no \nlonger applies.\nLT3652HV13\n3652hvfb For more information www.linear.com/LT3652HVAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIn low V IN applications, the BOOST supply can be powered \nby an external source for start-up, eliminating the V IN \nstart-up requirement.\nVBAT Output Decoupling\nAn L T3652HV charger output requires bypass capacitance \nconnected from the BAT pin to ground (C BAT). A 10µF  \nceramic capacitor is required for all applications. In systems \nwhere the battery can be disconnected from the charger \noutput, additional bypass capacitance may be desired for \nvisual indication for a no-battery condition (see the Status Pins section).\nIf it is desired to operate a system load from the L T3652HV \ncharger output when the battery is disconnected, additional bypass capacitance is required. In this type of application, \nexcessive ripple and/or low amplitude oscillations can oc\n-\ncur without additional output bulk capacitance.  For these \napplications, place a 100µF low ESR non-ceramic capacitor \n(chip tantalum or organic semiconductor capacitors such \nas Sanyo OS-CONs or POSCAPs) from BAT to ground, in parallel with the 10µF ceramic bypass capacitor .  This \nadditional bypass capacitance may also be required in \nsystems where the battery is connected to the charger with long wires. The voltage rating of C\nBAT must meet or \nexceed the battery float voltage.\nInductor Selection\nThe primary criterion for inductor value selection in an \nL T3652HV charger is the ripple current created in that \ninductor . Once the inductance value is determined, an \ninductor must also have a saturation current equal to or exceeding the maximum peak current in the inductor . An \ninductor value (L), given the desired amount of peak-to-\npeak inductor ripple current (ΔI\nL) can be approximated \nusing the relation:\n  L=10\x7fRSENSE\nΔIL\nICHG(MAX)\x7fVBAT(FLT)\x7f1–VBAT(FLT)\nVIN(MAX)⎡\n⎣⎢\n⎢⎤\n⎦⎥\n⎥□µH( )\n \nIn the above relation, V IN(MAX)  is the maximum operational \nvoltage. Ripple current is typically set within a range of 25% to 35% of I CHG(MAX) , so an inductor value can be \ndetermined by setting 0.25 < ΔI L/ICHG(MAX)  < 0.35.\nFigure 3. 14.4V at 1.5A Switched Inductor ValuesMAXIMUM OPERATIONAL V IN VOL TAGE (V)18 20 224SWITCHED INDUCTOR VALUE (µH)12\n101424\n16182022\n34\n3652 F038\n6\n26 28 24 30 32\nMagnetics vendors typically specify inductors with maxi -\nmum RMS and saturation current ratings. Select an inductor \nthat has a saturation current rating at or above I CHG(MAX)  \n+ ∆I L/ICHG(MAX) , and an RMS rating above I CHG(MAX) . In-\nductors must also meet a maximum volt-second product requirement.

The rectifier is selected based upon forward voltage, reverse voltage, and \nmaximum current. A Schottky diode is required, as low \nforward voltage yields the lowest power loss and highest efficiency. The rectifier diode must be rated to withstand \nreverse voltages greater than the maximum V\nIN voltage.\nLT3652HV14\n3652hvfb For more information www.linear.com/LT3652HVAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe minimum average diode current rating (I DIODE(MAX) ) \nis calculated with maximum output current (I CHG(MAX) ), \nmaximum operational V IN, and output at the precondition \nthreshold (V BAT(PRE) , or 0.7 • V BAT(FL T) ):\n IDIODE(MAX)>ICHG(MAX)\x7fVIN(MAX)–VBAT(PRE)\nVIN(MAX)(A)\nFor example, a rectifier diode for a 7.2V , 2A charger with \na 25V maximum input voltage would require:\n IDIODE(MAX)>2A\x7f25V−0.7(7.2V)\n25V,or\nIDIODE(MAX)>1.6A\nBattery Float Voltage Programming\nThe output battery float voltage (V BAT(FL T) ) is programmed \nby connecting a resistor divider from the BAT pin to V FB. \nVBAT(FL T)  can be programmed up to 18V .\nFigure 4. Feedback Resistors from BAT to V FB \nProgram Float VoltageBAT+\nVFB\nRFB2RFB1L T3652HV\n3652 F04Because the battery voltage is across the V BAT(FL T)  pro-\ngramming resistor divider , this divider will draw a small \namount of current from the battery (I RFB) at a rate of:\n  IRFB = 3.3/R FB2\nPrecision resistors in high values may be hard to ob -\ntain, so for some lower V BAT(FL T)  applications, it may be  \ndesirable to use smaller-value feedback resistors with an additional resistor (R\nFB3) to achieve the required 250k \nequivalent resistance. The resulting 3-resistor network, \nas shown in Figure 5, can ease component selection \nand/or increase output voltage precision, at the expense of  \nadditional current through the feedback divider .\nFor a three-resistor network, R FB1 and R FB2 follow the \nrelation:\n R FB2/RFB1 = 3.3/(V BAT(FL T)  – 3.3)\nExample: For V\nBAT(FL T)  = 3.6V:\n  RFB2/RFB1 = 3.3/(3.6 - 3.3) = 11.\n Setting divider current (I RFB) = 10µA yields:\n  RFB2 = 3.3/10µA\n  RFB2 = 330k\n Solving for R FB1:\n  RFB1 = 330k/11\n  RFB1 = 30k\n The divider equivalent resistance is:\n  RFB1||RFB2 = 27.5kBAT+\nVFB\nRFB2RFB3RFB1L T3652HV\n3652 F05\nFigure 5.

Spe -\ncial attention should be given to any stray capacitances \nthat can couple external signals onto the pin, which can \nproduce undesirable output transients or ripple. Effects of \nparasitic capacitance can typically be reduced by adding a small-value (20pF to 50pF) feedforward capacitor from \nthe BAT pin to the V\nFB pin.\nExtra care should be taken during board assembly. Small amounts of board contamination can lead to significant \nshifts in output voltage. Appropriate post-assembly board cleaning measures should be implemented to prevent \nboard contamination, and low-leakage solder flux is \nrecommended.\nInput Supply Voltage Regulation\nThe L T3652HV contains a voltage monitor pin that enables \nprogramming a minimum operational voltage. Connect\n-\ning a resistor divider from V IN to the V IN_REG  pin enables \nprogramming of minimum input supply voltage, typically \nused to program the peak power voltage for a solar panel. \nMaximum charge current is reduced when the V IN_REG  pin \nis below the regulation threshold of 2.7V .\nIf an input supply cannot provide enough power to satisfy \nthe requirements of an L T3652HV charger , the supply volt -\nage will collapse. A minimum operating supply voltage can thus be programmed by monitoring the supply through \na resistor divider , such that the desired minimum voltage \ncorresponds to 2.7V at the V\nIN_REG  pin. The L T3652HV \nservos the maximum output charge current to maintain \nthe voltage on V IN_REG  at or above 2.7V .\nProgramming of the desired minimum voltage is ac -\ncomplished by connecting a resistor divider as shown in \nFigure 6. The ratio of R IN1/RIN2 for a desired minimum \nvoltage (V IN(MIN) ) is:\n R IN1/RIN2 = (V IN(MIN) /2.7) – 1APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIf the voltage regulation feature is not used, connect the V\nIN_REG pin to V IN.\nMPPT Temperature Compensation\nA typical solar panel is comprised of a number of series-con -\nnected cells, each cell being a forward-biased p-n junction. \nAs such, the open-circuit voltage (V OC) of a solar cell has \na temperature coefficient that is similar to a common p-n \ndiode, or about –2mV/°C. The peak power point voltage \n(VMP) for a crystalline solar panel can be approximated as \na fixed voltage below V OC, so the temperature coefficient \nfor the peak power point is similar to that of V OC.\nPanel manufacturers typically specify the 25°C values for \nVOC, VMP, and the temperature coefficient for V OC, making \ndetermination of the temperature coefficient for V MP of a \ntypical panel straight forward.\nThe L T3652HV employs a feedback network to program \nthe V IN input regulation voltage.

As the temperature \ncharacteristic for a typical solar panel V MP voltage is highly \nlinear , a simple solution for tracking that characteristic can \nbe implemented using an LM234 3-terminal temperature \nsensor . This creates an easily programmable, linear tem -\nperature dependent characteristic.\nIn the circuit shown in figure 8,APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nBattery Voltage Temperature Compensation\nSome battery chemistries have charge voltage require -\nments that vary with temperature. Lead-acid batteries in \nparticular experience a significant change in charge volt -\nage requirements as temperature changes. For example, manufacturers of large lead-acid batteries recommend a float charge of 2.25V/cell at 25°C. This battery float voltage, however , has a temperature coefficient which is typically specified at –3.3mV/°C per cell.\nIn a manner similar to the MPPT temperature correction \noutlined previously, implementation of linear battery charge voltage temperature compensation can be ac\n-\ncomplished by incorporating an LM234 into the output feedback network.\nFor example, a 6-cell lead acid battery has a float charge \nvoltage that is commonly specified at 2.25V/cell at 25°C, or 13.5V , and a –3.3mV/°C per cell temperature coefficient, or –19.8mV/°C.

These pins are binary coded, \nand signal following the table below, where ON indicates \npin pulled low, and OFF indicates pin high-impedance:\nSTATUS PINS STATE\nCHARGER STATUS CHRG FAULT\nOFF OFF Not Charging — Standby or Shutdown Mode\nOFF ON Bad Battery Fault (Precondition Timeout / EOC \nFailure)\nON OFF Normal Charging at C/10 or Greater\nON ON NTC Fault (Pause)\nIf the battery is removed from an L T3652HV charger that \nis configured for C/10 termination, a sawtooth waveform \nL T3652HV196k\n198k6-CELL\nLEAD-ACID\nBATTERY\n22k\nB = 3380\n3652 F10aBAT\n69k\n69kVFB+\nTEMPERATURE (°C)–10VFLOAT  (V)\n10 50 40 60 0 20 30\n3652 F10b12.813.013.213.413.613.814.014.6\n14.4\n14.214.8\nTHEORETICAL V FLOAT\nPROGRAMMED V BAT(FLOAT)\nFigure 10.

An \nLED connected to this pin will exhibit a blinking pattern, indicating to the user that a battery is not present. The \nfrequency of this blinking pattern is dependent on the \noutput capacitance.\nC/10 Termination\nThe L T3652HV supports a low-current based termination \nscheme, where a battery charge cycle terminates when the current output from the charger falls to below one-tenth \nof the maximum current, as programmed with R\nSENSE . \nThe C/10 threshold current corresponds to 10mV across R\nSENSE . This termination mode is engaged by shorting \nthe TIMER pin to ground.\nWhen C/10 termination is used, a L T3652HV charger will \nsource battery charge current as long as the average current level remains above the C/10 threshold. As the full-charge \nfloat voltage is achieved, the charge current falls until \nthe C/10 threshold is reached, at which time the charger terminates and the L T3652HV enters standby mode. The \nCHRG status pin follows the charger cycle, and is high \nimpedance when the charger is not actively charging.\nWhen V\nBAT drops below 97.5% of the full-charged float \nvoltage, whether by battery loading or replacement of the \nbattery, the charger automatically re-engages and starts \ncharging.\nThere is no provision for bad battery detection if C/10 \ntermination is used.\nTimer Termination\nThe L T3652HV supports a timer based termination scheme, \nin which a battery charge cycle is terminated after a specific \namount of time elapses. Timer termination is engaged when a capacitor (C\nTIMER ) is connected from the TIMER \npin to ground. The timer cycle EOC (T EOC) occurs based on C TIMER  following the relation:\n C TIMER  = TEOC • 2.27 × 10–7 (Hours)\nTimer EOC is typically set to 3 hours, which requires a 0.68µF capacitor .\nThe CHRG status pin continues to signal charging at a C/10 \nrate, regardless of what termination scheme is used. When \ntimer termination is used, the CHRG status pin is pulled low during a charging cycle until the charger output current \nfalls below the C/10 threshold. The charger continues to \ntop-off  the battery until timer EOC, when the L T3652HV \nterminates the charging cycle and enters standby mode.\nTermination at the end of the timer cycle only occurs if \nthe charging cycle was successful. A successful charge cycle is when the battery is charged to within 2.5% of the \nfull-charge float voltage. If a charge cycle is not successful \nat EOC, the timer cycle resets and charging continues for another full timer cycle.\nWhen V\nBAT drops below 97.5% of the full-charge float \nvoltage, whether by battery loading or replacement of the \nbattery, the charger automatically reengages and starts \ncharging.\nPreconditioning and Bad Battery Fault\nA L T3652HV has a precondition mode, where charge cur -\nrent is limited to 15% of the programmed I CHG(MAX) , as \nset by R SENSE . The precondition current corresponds to \n15mV across R SENSE .\nPrecondition mode is engaged while the voltage on the \nVFB pin is below the precondition threshold (2.3V , or  \n0.7 • V BAT(FL T) ). Once the V FB voltage rises above the \nprecondition threshold, normal full-current charging can commence. The L T3652HV incorporates 70mV of threshold \nhysteresis to prevent mode glitching.\nLT3652HV19\n3652hvfb For more information www.linear.com/LT3652HVWhen the internal timer is used for termination, bad battery \ndetection is engaged. There is no provision for bad battery \ndetection if C/10 termination is used. A bad battery fault \nis triggered when the voltage on V FB remains below the \nprecondition threshold for greater than 1/8 of a full timer \ncycle (1/8 EOC). A bad battery fault is also triggered if a \nnormally charging battery re-enters precondition mode after 1/8 EOC.\nWhen a bad battery fault is triggered, the charging cycle \nis suspended, so the CHRG status pin becomes high-\nimpedance. The FAULT pin is pulled low to signal a fault \ndetection.\nCycling the charger’s power or SHDN function initiates \na new charging cycle, but a L T3652HV charger does not \nrequire a reset. Once a bad battery fault is detected, a new \ntimer charging cycle initiates when the V\nFB pin exceeds the \nprecondition threshold voltage. During a bad battery fault, \n0.5mA is sourced from the charger , so removing the failed \nbattery allows the charger output voltage to rise and initi -\nate a charge cycle reset. As such, removing a bad battery resets the L T3652HV , so a new charge cycle is started by \nconnecting another battery to the charger output.\nBattery Temperature Monitor and Fault\nThe L T3652HV can accommodate battery temperature \nmonitoring by using an NTC (negative temperature co-effi\n-\ncient) thermistor close to the battery pack. The temperature \nmonitoring function is enabled by connecting a 10kΩ,  \nB = 3380 NTC thermistor from the NTC pin to ground. If the NTC function is not desired, leave the pin unconnected.\nThe NTC pin sources 50µA, and monitors the voltage \ndropped across the 10kΩ thermistor . When the voltage on this pin is above 1.36V (0°C) or below 0.29V (40°C), \nthe battery temperature is out of range, and the L T3652HV \ntriggers an NTC fault. The NTC fault condition remains until the voltage on the NTC pin corresponds to a temperature \nwithin the 0°C to 40°C range. Both hot and cold thresholds \nincorporate hysteresis that correspond to 5°C.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIf higher operational charging temperatures are desired, the temperature range can be expanded by adding series \nresistance to the 10k NTC resistor . Adding a 0.91k resistor \nwill increase the effective hot temperature to 45°C.\nDuring an NTC fault, charging is halted and both status \npins are pulled low. If timer termination is enabled, the \ntimer count is suspended and held until the fault condi\n-\ntion is relieved.\nThermal Foldback\nThe L T3652HV contains a thermal foldback protection \nfeature that reduces maximum charger output current if the IC junction temperature approaches 125°C. In most \ncases, on-chip temperatures servo such that any exces\n-\nsive temperature conditions are relieved with only slight \nreductions in maximum charger current.\nIn some cases, the thermal foldback protection feature \ncan reduce charger currents below the C/10 threshold. In applications that use C/10 termination (TIMER = 0V), \nthe L T3652HV will suspend charging and enter standby \nmode until the excessive temperature condition is relieved.\nLayout Considerations\nThe L T3652HV switch node has rise and fall times that are \ntypically less than 10nS to maximize conversion efficiency. The switch node (Pin SW) trace should be kept as short \nas possible to minimize high frequency noise. The input \ncapacitor (C\nIN) should be placed close to the IC to minimize \nthis switching noise. Short, wide traces on these nodes \nalso help to avoid voltage stress from inductive ringing. \nThe BOOST decoupling capacitor should also be in close proximity to the IC to minimize inductive ringing. The \nSENSE and BAT traces should be routed together , and \nthese and the V\nFB trace should be kept as short as pos -\nsible. Shielding these signals from switching noise with a ground plane is recommended.\nLT3652HV20\n3652hvfb For more information www.linear.com/LT3652HVAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nHigh current paths and transients should be kept iso -\nlated from battery ground, to assure an accurate output  \nvoltage reference. Effective grounding can be achieved \nby considering switched current in the ground plane, \nand careful component placement and orientation can \neffectively steer these high currents such that the battery reference does not get corrupted. Figure 11 illustrates an \neffective grounding scheme using component placement \nto control ground currents. When the switch is enabled (loop #1), current flows from the input bypass capacitor \n(C\nIN) through the switch and inductor to the battery posi -\nSW VINRSENSE\nSENSE\nBAT\nVFB+GND\nL T3652HVDFCIN CBAT VBAT\n2\n3652 F111\nFigure 11. Component Orientation Isolates High Current Paths \nfrom Sensitive Nodestive terminal. When the switch is disabled (loop #2), the \ncurrent to the battery positive terminal is provided from \nground through the freewheeling Schottky diode (D F). In \nboth cases, these switch currents return to ground via the output bypass capacitor (C\nBAT).\nThe L T3652HV packaging has been designed to efficiently remove heat from the IC via the Exposed Pad on the \nbackside of the package, which is soldered to a copper footprint on the PCB. This footprint should be made as \nlarge as possible to reduce the thermal resistance of the \nIC case to ambient air .\nLT3652HV21\n3652hvfb For more information www.linear.com/LT3652HVTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\n2A Solar Panel Power Manager With 7.2V LiFePO 4 Battery  \nand 17V Peak Power TrackingSolar Panel Input Voltage Regulation, \nTracks Max Power Point to  \nGreater Than 98%\nSW VINVIN\n6V TO 34V (40V MAX)\nVIN_REG\nVFBBOOST\nSENSE\nBAT\nNTC\nTIMERCMDSH2-4L\nSYSTEM\nLOAD1µF\n30k\n223k\n3652 TA05+10µF\nC3\n10µF0.055.6µHL T3652HV\nSHDN\nCHRG\nFAULTCMSH3-40MA CMSH3-40MA\n330k\nLiFePO 4 CELLBasic 2A 1-Cell LiFePO 4 Charger (3.6V Float) with C/10 TerminationSW VINSOLAR \nPANEL INPUT\n(<40V OC \nVOL TAGE)\nVIN_REG\nVFBBOOST\nSENSE\nBAT\nNTC\nTIMERCMSH3-40MASYSTEM LOAD\n1µF\n542k\n459k\n3652 TA0210kB = 3380\n2-CELL LiFePO\n4 (2 × 3.6V) BATTERY PACK+10µFCMSH1-40MA\n10µF10µH\n0.05L T3652HV530k\n100kSHDN\nCHRG\nFAULTCMSH3-40MA\nCHARGER OUTPUT CURRENT (A)0.2INPUT REGULATION VOLTAGE (V)\n10121420\n18\n16\n0.6 11.2\n3652 TA0322\n0.4 0.8 1.6 1.4 2 1.8100% TO 98% PEAK POWER\n98% TO 95% PEAK POWERTA = 25°C\nLT3652HV22\n3652hvfb For more information www.linear.com/LT3652HV3.00 ±0.10\n(4 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
