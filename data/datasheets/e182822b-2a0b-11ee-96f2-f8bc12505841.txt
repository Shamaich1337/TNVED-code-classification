Precautions for General StoragePrecautions for General StoragePrecautions for General StoragePrecautions for General Storage\n•Avoid storage locations where devices may be exposed to moisture or direct sunlight.\n•Follow the precautions printed on the packing label of the device for transportation and storage.\n•Keep the storage location temperature and humidity within a range of 5 \ue00c to 35 \ue00c and 45 % to 75 %,\nrespectively.\n•Do not store the products in locations with poisonous gases (especially corrosive gases) or in dusty\nconditions.\n•Store the products in locations with minimal temperature fluctuations. Rapid temperature changes during\nstorage can cause condensation, resulting in lead oxidation or corrosion, which will deteriorate the\nsolderability of the leads.\n•When restoring devices after removal from their packing, use anti-static containers.\n•Do not allow loads to be applied directly to devices while they are in storage.\n•If devices have been stored for more than two years under normal storage conditions, it is recommended\nthat you check the leads for ease of soldering prior to use.2016-07-06\nRev.3.0\nTLP293\n913. 13. 13. 13.

#### Description:
The TLP293 is a low input and high isolation type photocoupler that integrates a phototransistor optically coupled to an InGaAs infrared emitting diode. This component is designed for high-density surface mounting applications, making it suitable for use in environments where space is limited. The TLP293 is particularly noted for its high isolation voltage, which enhances safety in electrical applications.

#### Typical Applications:
The TLP293 is commonly used in:
- **Switching Power Supplies:** To provide isolation between high and low voltage sections.
- **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs):** For interfacing between different logic levels while maintaining electrical isolation.
- **I/O Interface Boards:** To ensure safe communication between various components in electronic systems.

This component is ideal for applications requiring reliable isolation and signal transmission in harsh environments, making it a versatile choice in industrial and consumer electronics.
