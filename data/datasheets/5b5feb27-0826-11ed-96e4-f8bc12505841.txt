Pin Descriptions  \n4.1. Chip Select  (CS#)  \nThe SPI Chip Select (CS#) pin enables and disables device operation. When CS# is high, the \ndevice is deselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or DQ 0, DQ 1, DQ 2, DQ 3) pins are at high \nimpedance. W hen deselected, the devices power consumption will be at standby levels unless \nan internal erase, program or write status register cycle is in progress. When CS# is brought low, \nthe device will be selected, power consumption will increase to active levels and instructions can \nbe written to and data read from the device. After power -up, CS# must transition from high to low \nbefore a new instruction will be accepted. The CS# input must track the VCC supply level at \npower -up (see “ 8 Write Protection ” and Figure 81). If needed a pull -up resister on CS# can be \nused to accomplish this.  \n \n4.2. Serial Data Input, Output and I/Os (DI, DO and DQ0, DQ1, \nDQ2, DQ3)  \nThe FM25W 128 supports standard SPI, Dual SPI, Quad SPI and QPI operation. Standard SPI \ninstructions use the unidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to \nthe device on the rising edge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the \nunidirectional DO (output) to read data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \n \nDual/Quad SPI and QPI instructions use the bidirectional DQ pins to serially write instructions, \naddresses or data to  the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the \ndevice on the falling edge of CLK. Quad SPI and QPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad \nEnable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set. When QE=1, the WP# pin becomes DQ 2 and \nHOLD# pin becomes DQ 3. \n \n4.3. Write Protect  (WP#)  \nThe Write Protect (WP#) pin can be used to prevent the Status Registers from being written. The \nWP# pin is active low. However, when the QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, the \nWP# pin function is not a vailable since this pin is used for DQ2.  \n \n4.4. HOLD  (HOLD#)  \nThe HOLD# pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. When HOLD# is \nbrought low, while CS# is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals on the DI and \nCLK pins will be ignored (don’t care). When HOLD# is brought high, device operation can resume. \nThe HOLD# function can be useful when multiple devices are sharing the same SPI signals. The \nHOLD# pin is active low. When the QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, t he HOLD# pin \nfunction is not available since this pin is used for DQ 3. \n \n4.5. Serial Clock (CLK)  \nThe SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and output operations.  \n \n4.6. Reset(RESET#)  \nThe RESET# pin allows the device to be reset by the controller. For 8 -pin packages, when QE=0, the \nDQ 3 pin can be configured either as a HOLD# pin or as a RESET# pin depending on Status Register \nsetting.  \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             7 \nWhen QE=1, the HOLD # or RESET # function is not available.  \n5.

Memory Organization  \nThe FM25W 128 array is organized into 65,536 programmable pages of  256-bytes  each.  Up to \n256 bytes can be programmed (bits are programmed from 1 to 0) at a time. Pages  can be \nerased  in groups  of 16 (4KB  sector  erase),  groups  of 128 (32KB block erase), groups of  256 \n(64KB block erase)  or the entire  chip (chip  erase).  The FM25W 128 has 4,096 erasable sectors , \n512 erasable 32 -k byte blocks  and 256 erasable 64-k byte  blocks respe ctively. The small 4KB \nsectors  allow  for greater flexibility in applications that require  data and parameter storage.  \n \nTable 1 Memory Organization  \nBlock  \n(64KB)  Block  \n(32KB)  Sector  \n(4KB)  Address Range  \n255 511 \n| \n510 4095 FFF000h  FFFFFFh  \n… … … \n4080  FF0000h  FF0FFFh  \n...... ...... ...... ...... ...... \n...... ...... ...... \n...... ...... ...... \n248 497 \n| \n496 3983  F8F000h  F8FFFFh  \n… … … \n3968  F80000h  F80FFFh  \n...... ...... ...... ...... ...... \n...... ...... ...... \n...... ...... ...... \n15 31 \n| \n30 255 0FF000h  0FFFFFh  \n… … … \n240 0F0000h  0F0FFFh  \n...... ...... ...... ...... ...... \n...... ...... ...... \n...... ...... ...... \n8 17 \n| \n16 143 08F000h  08FFFFh  \n… … … \n128 080000h  080FFFh  \n7 15 \n| \n14 127 07F000h  07FFFFh  \n… … … \n112 070000h  070FFFh  \n...... ...... ...... ...... ...... \n...... ...... ...... \n...... ...... ...... \n2 5 \n| \n4 47 02F000h  02FFFFh  \n… … … \n32 020000h  020FFFh  \n1 3 \n| \n2 31 01F000h  01FFFFh  \n… … … \n16 010000h  010FFFh  \n0 1 \n| \n0 15 00F000h  00FFFFh  \n… … … \n2 002000h  002FFFh  \n1 001000h  001FFFh  \n0 000000h  000FFFh  \n \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             9 \n7.

Standard SPI  \nThe FM25W 128 is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial \nClock (CLK), Chip Select (CS#), Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO).  Standard \nSPI instructions use the DI input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or da ta to the device. \nThe DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device.  \n \nCommands, write instructions, addresses or data are latched on the rising edge of CLK, read \ndata or status are available on the falling edge of CLK.  \n \nSPI bus operation Mod e 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between \nMode 0 and Mode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in \nstandby and data is not being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0, the CLK signal is \nnormally low on the falling and rising edges of CS#. For Mode 3, the CLK signal is normally high \non the falling and rising edges of CS#.  \nCS#\nCLK\nDI\nDOMODE3\nMODE0MODE3\nMODE0\nBit7Bit6Bit5Bit4Bit3Bit2Bit1Bit0\nBit7Bit6Bit5Bit4Bit3Bit2Bit1Bit0\nMSBMSBHIGH IMPEDANCEDONT CARE\n \nFigure 6 The difference between Mode 0 and Mode 3   \n7.2. Dual SPI  \nThe FM25W128 supports Dual SPI operation when using instructions such as “Fast Read Dual \nOutput (3Bh)” , “Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh)”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or \nfrom the device at two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash dev ices. The Dual SPI \nRead instructions are ideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -\nshadowing) or for executing non -speed - critical code directly from the SPI bus (XIP). When using \nDual SPI instructions, the DI and DO pins become bidirec tional I/O pins: DQ 0 and DQ 1. \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             10 \n7.3. Quad SPI  \nThe FM25W 128 supports Quad SPI operation when using instructions such as “Fast Read Quad \nOutput (6Bh)”, “Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh)”, “Word Read Quad I/O (E7h)” , “Octal Word Read Quad \nI/O (E3h)”. These instructions allo w data to be transferred to or from the device four to six times the \nrate of ordinary Serial Flash. The Quad Read instructions offer a significant improvement in \ncontinuous and random access transfer rates allowing fast code -shadowing to RAM or execution \ndirectly from the SPI bus (XIP). When using Quad SPI instructions the DI and DO pins become \nbidirectional DQ 0 and DQ 1 and the WP #  and HOLD#  pins become DQ 2 and DQ 3 respectively. Quad \nSPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set.  \n \n7.4. QPI \nThe FM25W 128 supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) operations only when the device is \nswitched from Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using the “Enable QPI (38h)” instruction. \nThe typical SPI protocol requires that the b yte-long instruction code being shifted into the device only \nvia DI pin in eight serial clocks. The QPI mode utilizes all four DQ pins to input the instruction code, \nthus only two serial clocks are required. This can significantly reduce the SPI instructio n overhead \nand improve system performance in an XIP environment. Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode and QPI \nmode are exclusive. Only one mode can be active at any given time. “Enable QPI (38h)” and \n“Disable QPI (FFh)” instructions are used to switch between these  two modes. Upon power -up or \nafter a software reset using “Reset (99h)” instruction  or hardware reset , the default state of the device \nis Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode. To enable QPI mode, the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in \nStatus Register -2 is require d to be set. When using QPI instructions, the DI and DO pins become \nbidirectional DQ 0 and DQ 1, and the WP#  and HOLD#  pins become DQ 2 and DQ 3 respectively. See \nFigure 5 for the device operation modes.  \n \n7.5. Hold  \nFor Stan dard SPI and Dual SPI operations, the HOLD#  signal allows the FM25W 128 operation \nto be paused while it is actively selected (when CS# is low). The HOLD#  function may be useful \nin cases where the SPI data and clock signals are shared with other devices. For  example, \nconsider if the page buffer was only partially written when a priority interrupt requires use of the \nSPI bus. In this case the HOLD#  function can save the state of the instruction and the data in the \nbuffer so programming can resume where it left  off once the bus is available again. The HOLD#  \nfunction is only available for standard SPI and Dual SPI operation, not during Quad SPI or QPI.  \n \nTo initiate a HOLD#  condition, the device must be selected with CS# low. A HOLD#  condition \nwill activate on the  falling edge of the HOLD#  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is \nnot already low the  HOLD#  condition will activate after the next falling edge of CLK. The HOLD#  \ncondition will terminate on the rising edge of the HOLD#  signal if the CLK sig nal is already low. If \nthe CLK is not already low the HOLD#  condition will terminate after the next falling edge of CLK. \nDuring a HOLD#  condition, the Serial Data Output (DO) is high impedance, and Serial Data \nInput (DI) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored.  The Chip Select ( CS#) signal should be kept \nactive (low) for the full duration of the HOLD#  operation to avoid resetting the internal logic state \nof the device.  \nActive Active Active Hold Hold\n \nFigure 7 Hold Condition Waveform  \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             11 \n7.6. Softw are  Reset  & Hardware Reset  \nThe FM25W 128 can be reset to the initial power -on sate by a Software Reset sequence, either \nin SPI or QPI mode. This sequence must include two consecutive commands: Enable Reset \n(66h) & Reset (99h) . No command will be accepted d uring the reset period.  \n \nFM25W 128 can also be configured to utilize a hardware RESET # pin. The HOLD/RST bit in the \nStatus Register -2 is the configuration bit for HOLD # pin function or RESET # pin function. When \nHOLD/RST=0 (factory default), the pin acts as  a HOLD#  pin as described above; when \nHOLD/RST=1, the pin acts as a RESET#  pin. Drive the RESET#  pin low for a minimum period of \n~1us will reset the device to its initial power -on state. Any on -going Program/Erase operation will \nbe interrupted and data cor ruption may happen. While RESET#  is low, the device will not accept \nany command input.  \n \nIf QE bit is set to 1, the HOLD#  or RESET#  function will be disabled, the pin will become one of \nthe four data I/O pins.  \n \nHardware RESET#  pin has the highest priority  among all the input signals. Drive RESET#  low \nfor a minimum period of ~1us will interrupt any on -going external/internal operations, regardless \nthe status of other SPI sign als (CS#, CLK, DI, DO, WP# and/or HOLD# ).  \n \n \nNote:  \n1. While a faster RESET#  pulse (as  short as a few hundred nanoseconds) will often reset the \ndevice, a 1us minimum time is recommended to ensure reliable operation.  \n2. Data corruption may happen if there is an on -going or suspended internal Erase or \nProgram operation when software /hardware res et is accepted by the device.  It is \nrecommended to check the WIP bit and the SUS bit in Status Register before issuing the \nsoftware reset command or hardware reset.  \n \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             12 \n8.

To address this \nconcern, the FM25W 128 provides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n \nWrite Protect Features  \n\uf06c Device resets when VCC is belo w threshold  during WRITE  operation  \n\uf06c Time delay write disable after Power -up \n\uf06c Write enable/disable instructions and automatic write disable after erase or program  \n\uf06c Software and Hardware ( WP#  pin) write protection using Status Register  \n\uf06c Advanced Sector Protectio n \n\uf06c Write Protection using Power -down instruction  \n\uf06c Lock Down write protection for Status Register until the next power -up \n\uf06c One Time Program (OTP) write-protection for array and Security Sectors  using Status Register.  \n \nAt power -up and power -down, the device mus t not be selected; that is, CS# must follow the voltage \napplied on VCC until VCC reaches the correct values: VCC (min) at power -up and V ss at power -down.  \n \nTo avoid data corruption and inadvertent WRITE operations during power -up, a power -on reset \ncircuit i s included. The logic inside the device is held to RESET while VCC is less than the power -\non reset threshold voltage of VCC (low); all operations are disabled, and the device does not \nrespond to any instruction. During a standard power -up phase, the device  ignores all commands. \nAfter power -up, the device is in standby power mode.  \n \nIn the event Power -on Reset (POR) did not complete correctly after power up, the assertion of the \nRESET# signal or receiving a software reset command (RESET) will restart the POR process.  \n \nAt power -down, when VCC drops from the operating voltage to below the threshold voltage VCC \n(low), all operations are disabled and the device does not respond to any command.  \n \nNote: If power -down occurs while a WRITE, PROGRAM, or ERASE cycle is i n progress, data  \ncorruption may result.  \n \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instruction and \nsetting the Status Register Protect (SRP0, SRP1) and Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP [3:0]) \nbits. These settings all ow a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire memory array to be \nconfigured as read only. Used in conjunction with the Write Protect ( WP# ) pin, changes to the \nStatus Register can be enabled or disabled under hardware control. See Status Register sect ion \nfor further information. Additionally, the Power -down instruction offers an extra level of write \nprotection as all instructions are ignored except for the Release Power -down instruction.  \n \nThe FM25W 128 also provides another Write Protect method using th e individual Block Locks. \nEach 64KB block ( except the top and bottom blocks, total of 254 blocks) and each 4KB sector \nwithin the top/bottom blocks (total of 32 sectors) are equipped with an Individual Block Lock bit. \nWhen the lock bit is 0, the correspondi ng sector or block can be erased or programmed; when \nthe lock bit is set to 1, Erase or Program commands issued to the corresponding sector or block \nwill be ignored. When the device is powered on, all individual Block Lock bits will be 1, so the \nentire mem ory array is protected from Erase/Program. An “Individual Block Unlock ( 39h)” \ninstruction must be issued to unlock any specific sector or block.  \n \nThe WPS bit in Status Register -2 is used to decide which Write Protect scheme should be used. \nWhen WPS=0(facto ry default), the device will only utilize CMP, SEC, TB, BP[2:0] to protect specific \nareas of the array; when WPS=1, the device will utilize the Individual Block Locks  for write protection , \neach protect scheme for the corresponding is available .\n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             13 \n9. Status Regist er \nThree Status Registers are provided for FM25W 128. The Read Status Register -1/2/3  \ninstructions can be used to provide status on the availability of the Flash memory array, whether  \nthe device is write enabled or disabled, the state of write protection, Qu ad SPI setting, Security \nSector lock status , Erase/Program Suspend status  and output driver strength . The Write Status \nRegister instruction can be used to configure the device write protec tion features, Quad SPI \nsetting, Security Sector OTP lock , Hold /RESE T functions and output driver strength . Write \naccess to the Status Register is cont rolled by the state of the non -volatile Status Register Protect \nbits (SRP0, SRP1), the Write Enable instruction, and during Standard/Dual SPI operations, the \nWP# pin.  \n \nFacto ry default for all Status Register bits are 0.  \n \n9.1.

Write In Progress  (WIP)  \nWIP is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is \nexecuting a Page Program, Quad Page Program, Secto r Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write \nStatus Register or Erase/Program Security Sector instruction. During this time the device will \nignore further instructions except for the Read Status Regi ster and Erase/Program Suspend \ninstruction (see tW, tPP, tSE , tBE, and tCE in “11.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). When the \nprogram,  erase or write status  register  (or security  sector) instruction has completed, the WIP bit \nwill be cleared to a 0 state indicating the device is ready for further instructions.  \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             14 \n9.1.2.  Write Enable Latch (WEL)  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the status register (S1) that is set to 1 after \nexecuting a Write Enable Instruction. The WEL status bit is cleared to 0 when the device is write \ndisabled. A write disable  state  occurs  upon  power -up or after any of the following instructions: \nWrite Disable, Page Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, \nWrite Status Register, Eras e Security Sector and Program Security Sector . \n \n9.1.3.  Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0)  \nThe Block Protect Bits ( BP2, BP1, BP0 ) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register  that \nprovide Write Protection control and status. Block Protect bits can be se t using the Write Status \nRegister Instruction (see t W in “11.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). All, none or a portion of the \nmemory array can be protected from Program and Erase instructions (see Status Register Memory \nProtection ). The factory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of the array protected.  \n \n9.1.4.  Top/Bottom Block Protect (TB)  \nThe non -volatile Top/Botto m bit (TB) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect \nfrom the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in Status Register Memory \nProtection  table. The factory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the Write Status \nRegister Instruction depending on the state of the SRP0, SRP1 and WEL bits.  \n \n9.1.5.  Sector/Block Protect (SEC)  \nThe non -volatile Sector/Block Protect bit (SEC) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) \nprotect e ither 4KB Sectors (SEC=1) or 64KB Blocks (SEC=0) in the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom \n(TB=1) of the array as shown in Table 4 Status Register Memory Protection  table. The defaul t \nsetting is SEC=0.  \n \n9.2.

Status Register Protect (SRP1, SRP0)  \nThe Status Register Protect bits (SRP1 and SRP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status \nregister (S8  and S7). The SRP bits control  the method  of write protection:  software  protection,  \nhardware protection, power supply lock -down or one time programmable (OTP) protection.  \n \nTable 2 Status Register Protect bits  \nSRP1  SRP0  WP#  Status  \nRegister  Description  \n0 0 X Software  \nProtection  WP# pin has no control. The Status register can be \nwritten to after a Write Enable instruction, WEL=1. \n(Factory Default ) \n0 1 0 Hardware  \nProtected  When WP#  pin is low the Status Register locked and can \nnot be written to.  \n0 1 1 Hardware  \nUnprotected  When WP#  pin is high the Status register is unlocked and \ncan be written to after a Write Enable instruction, WEL=1.  \n1 0 X Power Supply  \nLock -Down  Status Register is protected and can not be written to \nagain until the next power -down, power -up cycle.(1) \n1 1 X One T ime \nProgram  Status Register is permanently protected and can not be \nwritten to.  \nNote:  \n1. When SRP1, SRP0 = (1, 0), a power -down, power -up cycle will change SRP1, SRP0 to (0, 0) \nstate.  \n \n9.2.2.  HOLD# or RESET# pin function(HOLD/RST)  \nThe HOLD/RST bit is used to determ ine whether HOLD# or RESET# function should be \nimplemented on the hardware pin for 8 -pin packages. When HOLD/RST=0 (factory default), the \npin acts as HOLD#; when HOLD/RST=1, the pin acts as RESET#. However, HOLD# or RESET# \nfunctions are only available when  QE=0. If QE is set to 1, the HOLD# and RESET# functions are \ndisabled, the pin acts as a dedicated data I/O pin.  \n \n9.2.3.  Complement Protect (CMP)  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S14). It is \nused in conjunc tion with SEC, TB, BP [2:0] bits to provide more flexibility for the array protection. \nOnce CMP is set to 1, previous array protection set by SEC, TB, BP 2, BP1 and BP0  will be \nreversed. For instance, when CMP=0, a top 4KB sector can be protected while the r est of the \narray is not; when CMP=1, the top 4KB sector will become unprotected while the rest of the array \nbecome read -only. Please refer to Status Register Memory Protection  table for details. The \ndefault setting  is CMP=0.  \n \n9.2.4.  Write Protect Selection (WPS)  \nThe WPS bit is used to select which Write Protect scheme should be used. When WPS=0, the \ndevice will use the combination of CMP, TB, SEC, BP[2:0] to protect a specific area of the \nmemory array. When WPS=1, the devi ce will utilize the Individual Block Locks to protect any \nindividual sector or blocks. The default value for all Individual Block Lock bits is 1 upon device \npower on or after reset.  \n9.2.5.  Output driver strength (DRV1, DRV0)  \nThe DRV1 & DRV0 bits are used to deter mine the output driver strength.  \n \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             16 \nTable 3  Driver strength configuration  \nDRV1, DRV0  Driver Strength  \n0,0 100%  \n0,1 75% \n1,0 50% \n1,1 25% \n \n9.2.6.  Security Sector Lock Bit (LB)  \nThe Security Register Lock Bit (LB) is non-volatile One Time Pr ogram (OTP) bits in Status \nRegister ( S10) that provide the write protect control and status to the Security Registers. The \ndefault state of LB is 0, Security Registers are unlocked. LB can be set to 1 individually using the \nWrite Status Register instructio n. LB is One Time Programmable (OTP), once it’s set to 1, the \ncorresponding 1024 -Byte Security Register will become read -only permanently.  \n9.2.7.  Quad Enable (QE)  \nThe Quad Enable (QE) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S9) that allows \nQuad SPI and QPI operation. When the QE bit is set to a 0 state (factory default), the WP#  pin \nand HOLD#  are enabled. When the QE bit is set to a 1, the Quad DQ2 and DQ3 pins are enabled, \nand WP#  and HOLD#  functions are disabled.  \n \nQE bit is required to be se t to a 1 before issuing an “Enable QPI (38h)” to switch the device from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI to QPI; otherwise the command will be ignored. When the device is in \nQPI mode, QE bit will remain to be 1. A “Write Status Register” command in QPI mode cannot \nchange QE bit from a 1 to a 0.  \n \nWARNING: If the WP#  or HOLD#  pins are tied directly to the power supply or ground \nduring standard SPI or Dual SPI operation, the QE bit should never be set to a 1.  \n \n9.3. Status Register -3 (SR3)  \nRelated Commands: Read Status Regist er-3 (RDSR3 15h), Write Enable ( 06h). Write Enable \n(06h)  can be used to clear ERR  bit of SR3 if ERR  is set to 1 by the last operation.  \n \nS22 S21 S23 S19 S18 S20 S17 S16\nRFU RFU SUS ERRRFU RFU RFURFU\nReservedSUSPEND STATUS\n(Volatile, Read Only)\nReservedProgram/Erase Fail Bit\n(Volatile,Read Only)\n \nFigure 10 Status Register -3 \n \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             17 \n9.3.1.  Erase/Program Suspend Status (SUS)  \nThe Suspend Status bit is a read only bit in the status register (S 23) that is set to 1 after \nexecuting an Erase/Program Suspend (75h) instruction. The SUS status bit is cleared to 0 by \nErase/Program Resume (7Ah) instruction as well as a power -down, power -up cycle.  \n \n9.3.2.  Write  Fail Bit (ERR ) \nThe Write  Fail bit is a status flag, which shows the status of last write  operation. It wil l be set to 1, \nif the program or erase or write status register operation fails.  It is cleard to 0 by WREN ( 06h) or \nReset operation.  \n \n9.4.

Instructions  \nThe Standard/Dual/Quad SPI instruction set of the FM25W 128 consists of 44 basic instructions \nthat are fully controlled through the SPI bus (see Table 7 ~ Table 10 Instruction Set). Instructions \nare initiated with the falling edge of Chip Select ( CS#). The first byte of data clocked into the DI \ninput provides the instruction code. Data on the DI input is sampled on the rising edge of clock \nwith most significant bit (MSB) first.  \n \nThe QPI instruction set of the FM25W 128 consists of 30 basic instructions that are fully \ncontrolled through the SPI bus (see  Table 10 Instruction Set). Instructions are initiated with the \nfalling edge of Chip Select ( CS#). The firs t byte of data clocked through DQ [3:0] pins provides \nthe instruction code. Data on all four DQ pins are sampled on the rising edge of clock with most \nsignificant bit (MSB) first. All QPI instructions, addresses, data and dummy bytes are using all \nfour DQ pins to transfer every byte of data with every two serial clocks (CLK).  \n \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address \nbytes, data bytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in so me cases, a combination. Instructions are \ncompleted with the rising edge of CS#. Clock relative timing diagrams for each instruction are \nincluded in Figure 12 through Figure 85. All read instructions can be completed after any clocked \nbit. However, all instructions that Write, Program or Erase must complete on a byte boundary \n(CS# driven high after a full 8 -bits have been clocked) otherwise the instruction will be ignored. \nThis feature further protects the device from inadvertent writes.

Instruction Description  \n10.2.1.  Write Enab le (WREN ) (06h)  \nThe Write Enable  (WREN) instruction ( Figure 12) sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the \nStatus Register to a  1. The WEL bit must be set prior to every Page Program, Quad Page \nProgram, Sector Er ase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register and Erase/Program \nSecurity Sectors instruction. The Write Enable (WREN ) instruction is entered by driving CS# low, \nshifting the instruction code “06h” into the Data Input (DI) pin on the rising edge of CL K, and then \ndriving CS# high.  \n \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (06h)CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)\nD0\n(DQ1)High ImpedanceMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\n(06h)CS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ3\n \nFigure 12 Write Enable Instruction for SPI Mode (left) or QPI Mode (right)  \n \n10.2.2.  Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h)  \nThe non -volatile Status Register bits described in section 9.1, 9.2, 9.3  can also be written to as \nvolatile bits. This gives more flexibility to change the system confi guration and memory \nprotection schemes quickly without waiting for the typical non -volatile bit write cycles or affecting \nthe endura nce of the Status Register non -volatile bits. To write the volatile values into the Status \nRegister bits, the Write Enable f or Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction must be issued prior \nto a Write Status Register (01h) instruction. Write Enable for Volatile Status Register instruction \n(Figure 13) will not set the Write Enable Latch  (WEL) bit, it is only valid for the Write Status \nRegister instruction to change the volatile Status Register bit values.  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction(\n50h)CS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ30       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (50h)CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)\nD0\n(DQ1)High Impedance\n \nFigure 13 Write Enable for Volatile Status Register Instruction for SPI Mode (le ft) or QPI \nMode (right)  \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             26 \n10.2.3.  Write Disable  (WRDI)  (04h)  \nThe Write Disable (WRDI) instruction ( Figure 14) resets the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the \nStatus Register to a 0. The Write Disable  (WRDI)  instruction is ent ered by driving CS# low, \nshifting the instruction code “04h” into the DI pin and then driving CS# high.

Read Status Register -1 (RDSR1)  (05h) , Status Register -2 \n(RDSR2)  (35h) & Status Register -3 (RDSR3)  (15h)  \nThe Read Status Register instructions allow the 8 -bit Status Registers to be read. The instruction \nis entered by driving CS# low and shifting the instruction code “05h”  for Status Register -1, “35h” \nfor Status Register -2 or “15h” for Status Register -3 into the DI pin on the rising edge of CLK. The \nstatus register bits are then shifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most \nsignificant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure 15. Refer to section 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 for Status \nRegister description.  \n \nThe Read Status R egister instruction may be used at any time, even while a Program, Erase or \nWrite Status Register cycle is in progress. This allows the WIP status bit to be checked to \ndetermine when the cycle is complete and if the device can accept another instruction. T he \nStatus Register can be read continuously, as shown in Figure 16.

Write Status Register -1 (WRSR1)  (01h) , Status Register -2 \n(WRSR2) (31h)  \nThe Write Status Register instruction allows the Status Register  to be written. The writable \nStatus Register bits include: SRP0, TB, SEC, BP 2, BP1 and BP0 in Status Register -1; \nHOLD/RST, CMP , LB, QE, SRP1 , DRV1, DRV0 and WPS  in Status Register -2. All other Status \nRegister bit locations are read -only and will not be aff ected by Write Status Register instruction. \nLB is a non-volatile OTP bit, once it is set to 1, it cannot  be cleared to 0.  \n \nTo write non -volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must \npreviously have been executed for the devi ce to accept the Write Status Register  instruction \n(Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). Once write enabled, the instruction is entered by driving \nCS# low, sending the instruction code “01h /31h”, and then writing the status register data byte \nas illustra ted in Figure 17 & Figure 18. \n \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction \nmust have been executed prior to  the Wri te Status Register instruction  (Status Register bit WEL \nremains 0). However, SRP1 and LB cannot  be changed from 1 to 0 because of the OTP \nprotection for these bits. Upon power off or the execution of  Software Reset , the volatile Status \nRegister bit values will be lost, and the non -volatile Status Register bit values will be restored.  \n \nDuring non -volatile Status Register write operation (06h combined with 01h/31h), after CS# is \ndriven high, the self -timed Write Status Register cycle will commence for a time  duration of t W \n(See “ 11.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, \nthe Read Status Register instruction may still be access ed to check the status of the WIP bit. \nThe WIP bit is a 1 during the Write Status Register cycle and a 0 when the cycle is finished and \nready to accept other instructions again. After the Write Status Register cycle has finished, the \nWrite Enable Latch (WE L) bit in the Status Register will be cleared to 0.  \n \nDuring volatile Status Register write operation (50h combined with 01h /31h), after CS# is driven \nhigh, the Status Register bits will be refreshed to the new values within the time period of t SHSL2  \n(See “11.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). WIP bit will remain 0 during the Status Register bit \nrefresh period.  \n \nThe Write Status Register instruction  can be used in both SPI  mode and QPI mode. However, \nthe QE bit cannot be written to 0 when the device is in the QPI mode, because QE=1 is required \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             28 \nfor the device to enter and operate in the QPI mode.  \n \nRefer to section 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 for Status Register description.

Read Data (03h)  \nThe Read Data instructio n allows one or more data bytes to be sequentially read from the \nmemory. The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and then shifting the instruction \ncode “03h” followed by a  24-bit address A23-A0 into the DI pin. The code and address bits are  \nlatched on the rising edge of the CLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the \naddressed memory location will be shifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with \nmost significant bit (MSB) first. The address is automatically incre mented to the next higher \naddress after each byte of data is shifted out allowing for a continuous stream of data. This \nmeans that the entire memory can be accessed with a single instruction as long as the clock \ncontinues. The instruction is completed by d riving CS# high.  \n \nThe Read Data instruction sequence is shown in Figure 21. If a Read Data instruction is issued \nwhile an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process ( WIP =1) the instruction is ignored and will \nnot have any effect  on the current cycle. The Read Data instruction allows clock rates from D.C. \nto a maximum of f R (see “11.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). \n \nThe Read Da ta (03h) instruction is only supported in Standard SPI mode.  \nCLKMode3\nMode0012345678910282930313233343536373839\nDI\n(DQ0)232221 3210Instruction (03h) 24-Bit Addess\nDO\n(DQ1)HIGH IMPEDANCE\n765432107Data Out1 Data Out2\n▲\n▲ = MSB▲CS#\n \nFigure 21 Read Data Instruction (SPI Mode only)  \n \n \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             30 \n10.2.7.  Fast Read (0Bh)  \nThe Fast Read instruction is similar to the Read Data instruction except that it can operate at the \nhighest possible frequency of F R (see “11.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). This is accomplished \nby adding eight “dummy” clocks after the 24 -bit address as shown in Figure 22.

Depending on the Read Parameter Bits P[5:4] setting, \nthe number of dummy clocks can be  configured as either 2, 4, 6 or 8.

Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh)  \nThe Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh) instruction  allows for improved random access while maintaining \ntwo I/O pins, DQ 0 and DQ 1. It is similar to the Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh) instruction but with \nthe capability to input the Address bits A23 -A0 two bits per clock. This reduced instruction \noverhead may allow for code execution (XIP) directly from the Dual SPI in some applications.  \n \nFast Read Dual I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Fast Read  Dual I/O instruction  can further  reduce  instruction  overhead  through  setting  the \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7-0) after the input Address bits A23-A0, as shown in Figure 26. \nThe upper nibble of the (M7-4) controls the length of the next Fast Read Dual I/O instruction \nthrough the inclusion or exclusion of the first byte instr uction code. The lower nibble bits of the \n(M3-0) are don’t care (“x”). However, the DQ pins should be high -impedance prior to the falling \nedge of the first data out clock.  \n \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5 -4 = (1,0), then the next Fast Read Dual I/O i nstruction \n(after CS# is raised and then lowered) does not require the BBh instruction code, as shown in \nFigure 27.

Fast Read Quad I/ O (EBh)  \nThe Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh) instruction is similar to the Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh) instruction \nexcept that address and data bits are input and output through four pins DQ 0, DQ 1, DQ 2 and DQ 3 \nand four Dummy clocks are required in SPI mode prior to t he data output. The Quad I/O \ndramatically reduces instruction overhead allowing faster random access for code execution (XIP) \ndirectly from the Quad SPI. The Quad Enable bit (QE) of Status Register -2 must be set to enable \nthe Fast Read Quad I/O Instruction . \n \nFast Read Quad I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Fast Read  Quad  I/O instruction  can further  reduce  instruction  overhead  through  setting  the \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7-0) after the input Address bits A23-A0, as shown in Figure 28. \nThe upper nibble of the (M7-4) controls the length of the next Fast Read Quad I/O instruction \nthrough the inclusion or exclusion of the first byte instruction code. The lower nibble bits of the \n(M3-0) are don’t care (“x”). However , the DQ pins should be high -impedance prior to the falling \nedge of the first data out clock.  \n \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5 -4 = (1,0), then the next Fast Read Quad I/O instruction \n(after CS# is raised and then lowered) does not require the EBh ins truction code, as shown in \nFigure 29. This reduces the instruction sequence by eight clocks and allows the Read address to \nbe immediately entered after CS# is asserted low. If the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5 -4 do \nnot equal to (1 , 0), the next instruction (after CS# is raised and then lowered) requires the first \nbyte instruction code, thus returning to normal operation.

See  “Set Burst with Wrap (77h) ” for detail descriptions.  \n \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             39 \n10.2.13.  Octal Word Read Quad I/O ( E3h) \nThe Octal Word Read Quad I/O ( E3h) instruction is similar to the Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh) \ninstruction  except that the lower four Address bits (A0, A1, A2, A3) must equal 0. As a result, the \ndummy clocks are not required, which further reduces the instruction overhead allowing even \nfaster random access for code execution (XIP). The Quad Enable bit (QE) of Status Register -2 \nmust be set to enable the Octal Word Read Quad I/O Instruction.  \n \nOctal Word Read Quad I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Octal Word Read Quad I/O instruction can further reduce instruction overhead through \nsetting the “Continuous Read Mo de” bits M7-M0 after the input Address bits A23-A0, as shown in \nFigure 33. The upper nibble of the (M7-4) controls the length of the next Octal Word Read Quad \nI/O instruction through the inclusion or exclusion of t he first byte instruction code. The lower \nnibble bits of the (M3-0) are don’t care (“x”). However, the DQ pins should be high -impedance \nprior to the falling edge of the first data out clock.  \n \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5 -4 = (1,0), then the next F ast Read Quad I/O instruction \n(after CS# is raised and then lowered) does not require the E3h instruction code, as shown in \nFigure 34. This reduces the instruction sequence by eight clocks and allows the Read addre ss to \nbe immediately entered after CS# is asserted low. If the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5 -4 do \nnot equal to (1,  0), the next instruction (after CS# is raised and then lowered) requires the first \nbyte instruction code, thus returning to normal operation . It is recommended to input FFh on DQ 0 \nfor the next instruction (8 clocks), to ensure M4  = 1 and return the device to normal operation.  \n \nCS#\nIOs switch from\nInput to OutputA23-16     A15-8      A7-0       M7-0\nDQ0 20     16      12      8       4       0       4       0 4       0       4       0       4                               \nDQ1 21     17     13      9       5       1       5       1 5       1       5       1       5                               \nDQ3 23    19      15     11      7       3       7       3       7       3       7       3       7                               \nByte1 Byte2DQ2 22     18     14     10      6       2       6       2 6       2       6       2       6                               0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (E3h)CLK8       9      10     11     12     13     14     15 16     17     18     19     20     21  \n1        5                            \nByte3 Byte4 0        4               \n 2        6                          \n3        7                              \nFigure 33 Octal Word Read Quad I/O Instruction (Initial instructi on or  previous M5 -4 ≠ 10, \nSPI Mode only)  \n \nCS#\nIOs switch from\nInput to OutputA23-16     A15-8      A7-0       M7-0\nDQ0 20     16      12      8       4       0       4       0 4       0       4       0       4                               \nDQ1 21     17     13      9       5       1       5       1 5       1       5       1       5                               \nDQ3 23    19      15     11      7       3       7       3       7       3       7       3       7                               \nByte1Byte2DQ2 22     18     14     10      6       2       6       2 6       2       6       2       6                               0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0 CLK8       9      10     11     12     13  \n1        5                            \nByte3 Byte4 0        4               \n 2        6                          \n3        7                             \n \nFigure 34 Octal Word Read Quad I/O Instruction (Previous instruction set M5 -4 = 10, SPI \nMode only)  \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             40 \n10.2.14.  Set Burst with Wrap (77h)  \nThe Set Burst with Wrap (77h) instruction  is used in conjunction with “Fast Read Quad I/O” and \n“Word Read Quad I/O” instructions to access a fixed length of 8/16/32/64 -byte section within a \n256-byte page. Certain applications can benefit from this feature and improve the overall system \ncode execu tion performance.  \n \nSimilar to a Quad I/O instruction, the Set Burst with Wrap instruction is initiated by driving the \nCS# pin low and then shifting the instruction code “77h” followed by 24 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap \nBits”, W7 -0. The instruction sequence is sh own in Figure 35.

To exit t he “Wrap Around” function and return to normal read operation, \nanother Set Burst with Wrap instruction should be issued to set W4 = 1. The default value of W4 \nupon power on is 1. In the case of a system Reset while W4 = 0, it is recommended that the \ncontro ller issues a Set Burst with Wrap instruction to reset W4 = 1 prior to any normal Read \ninstructions since FM25W 128 does not have a hardware Reset Pin.  \n \n \nDQ0 X       X       X      X      X       X     W4      X CS#\nCLK\nInstruction (77h)don’t\ncare\nDQ2DQ1\nDQ3Mode 3\nMode 00       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 08       9      10     11     12     13     14     15 \ndon’t\ncaredon’t\ncareWrap \nBit\nX       X      X       X       X      X     W5     X \nX      X       X      X       X      X       X       X X       X       X      X      X      X     W6     X \n \nFigure 35 Set Burst with Wrap Instruction  for SPI Mode  \n \n10.2.15.  Page Program (02h)  \nThe Page Program instruction allows from one byte to 256 bytes (a page) of data to be \nprogrammed at previously erased  (FFh) memory locations. A Write Enable instruction must be \nexecuted before the device will accept the Page Progra m Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). \nThe instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low then shifting the instruction code “02h” \nfollowed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. The CS# pin must \nbe held low for t he entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the device. The Page \nProgram instruction sequence is shown in Figure 36 and Figure 37. \nIf an entire 256 byte  page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significant \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             41 \naddress bits) should be set to 0. If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks \nexceed s the remaining page length, the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the p age. In \nsome cases, less than 256 bytes (a partial page) can be programmed without having any effect \non other bytes within the same page. One condition to perform a partial page program is that the \nnumber of clocks can not exceed the remaining page length.  If more than 256 bytes are sent to \nthe device the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page and overwrite previously sent \ndata.  \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the \nlast byte has bee n latched. If this is not done the Page Program instruction will not be executed. \nAfter CS# is driven high, the self -timed Page Program instruction will commence for a time \nduration of t PP (See “11.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While the Page Program cycle is in \nprogress, the Read Status Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of \nthe WIP bit. The WIP bit is a 1 during the Page Program cycle  and becomes a 0 when the cycle is \nfinished and the device is ready to accept other instructions again. After the Page Program cycle \nhas finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Page \nProgram instruction will not  be executed if the addressed page is protected by the Block Protect \n(CMP, SEC, TB, BP 2, BP1 and BP0 ) bits  or the Individual Block/Sector Locks . \n \nCS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)\n«7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n«0       7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n«7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0  \nData Byte 239     40     41     42     43     44     45     46 47     48     49     50     51     52     53     54     55 \n2072\n2073\n2074\n2075\n2076\n2077\n2078\n2079\nMode 3\nMode 0\nData Byte 3 Data Byte 2560       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (02h)CS#\nCLK8       9      10              28     29     30     31 32     33     34     35     36     37     38     39 \n24-Bit Address\nDI\n(DQ0)\n« «23     22     21               3       2       1       0 Data Byte 1\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n«=MSB\n \nFigure 36 Page Program Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \n20      16      12       8        4        0        4        0 4        0        4        0                                 \n21      17      13       9        5        1        5        1 5        1        5        1                                    \n23      19      15      11       7        3        7        3 7        3        7        3      22      18      14      10       6        2        6        2 6        2        6        2        A23-16      A15-8       A7-0        Byte1       Byte2        Byte30       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 08       9      10     11     12     13    \nDQ0CS#\nCLK\nDQ2DQ1\nDQ34        0        4        0                                 \n5        1        5        1                                    \n7        3        7        3      6        2        6        2        Instruction\n02h\n   Mode 3\nMode 0516\n517\n518\n519\nByte 255    Byte 256\n \nFigure 37 Page Program Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             42 \n10.2.16.  Quad Input Page Program (32h)  \nThe Quad Page Program instruction allows up to 256 bytes of data to be programmed at \npreviously erased (FFh) memory locations using four  pins: DQ 0, DQ 1, DQ 2, and DQ 3. The Quad \nPage Program can improve performance for PROM Programmer and applications that have slow \nclock speeds <5MHz. Systems with faster clock speed will not realize much benefit for the Quad \nPage Program instruction since t he inherent page program time is much greater than the time it \ntake to clock -in the data.  \nTo use Quad Page Program the Quad Enable in Status Register -2 must be set (QE=1). A Write \nEnable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Quad P age Program \ninstruction (Status Register -1, WEL=1). The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low then \nshifting the instruction code “32h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 and at least one data byte, \ninto the DQ pins. The CS# pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while data \nis being sent to the device. All other functions of Quad Page Program are identical to standard \nPage Program.

Sector Erase (20h)  \nThe Sector Erase instruction sets all memory within a specified sector (4K -bytes) to the erased \nstate of all  1s (FFh). A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept \nthe Sector Erase Instruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the CS# pin low and shifting the instruction code “20h” followed a 24 -bit sector address \nA23-A0 (see Figure 4). The Sector Erase instruction sequence is shown in Figure 39 & Figure 40. \n \nThe CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not \ndone the Sector Erase instruction will not be executed. After CS# is driven high, the self -timed \nSector Erase instruction will commence for a time durati on of t SE (See “11.6 AC Electrical \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             43 \nCharacteristics ”).

The Erase/Program Suspend instruction sequence is shown in Figure 46 & Figure 47. \n \nThe Write Status Register instruction (01h , 31h ), Program and Erase instructionsare not allowed \nduring Program/ Erase Suspend. Erase Suspend is valid only during the Sector or Block erase \noperation. If written during the Chip Erase operation, the Suspend instruction is ignored.  \n \nThe Erase/Program Suspend  instruction “75h” will be accepted by the device only if the SUS bit \nin the Status Register equals to 0 and the WIP bit equals to 1 while a Sector or Block Erase or a \nPage Program operation is on -going.

Power -down (B9h)  \nAlthough the standby current during normal operation is relatively low, standby current can be \nfurther reduced with the Power -down instruc tion. The lower power consumption makes the \nPower -down instruction especially useful for battery powered applications (See I CC1 and I CC2 in \n“11.4 DC Electrical Characteristics ”). The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and \nshifting the instruction code “B9h” as shown in Figure 50 & Figure 51. \n \nThe CS# pin must be driven hig h after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the \nPower -down instruction will not be executed. After CS# is driven high, the power -down state will \nenter within the time duration of t DP (See “11.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While in the power -\ndown state only the Release from Power - down / Device ID instruction, which restores the device \nto normal operation, will be recognized. All other instructions ar e ignored. This includes the Read \nStatus Register instruction, which is always available during normal operation. Ignoring all but \none instruction makes the Power Down state a useful condition for securing maximum write \nprotection.

Release Power -down / Device ID (ABh)  \nThe Release from Power -down / Device ID instruction is a multi -purpose instruction. It can be \nused to release the device from the power -down state, or obtain the devices electronic \nidentification (ID)  number.  \n \nTo release the device from the power -down state, the instruction is issued by driving the CS# pin \nlow, shifting the instruction code “ABh” and driving CS# high as shown in Figure 52 & Figure 53. \nRelease from power -down will take the time duration of t RES1 (See “11.6 AC Electrical \nCharacteristics ”) before the device will resume no rmal operation and other instructions are \naccepted. The CS# pin must remain high during the t RES1 time duration.  \n \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the power -down state, the instruction is \ninitiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting  the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3 -dummy \nbytes. The Device ID bits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit \n(MSB) first as shown in  Figure 54 & Figure 55. The Device ID value for the FM25W 128 is listed \nin Table 6 Manufacturer and Device Identification  table. The Device ID can be read continuously. \nThe instruction is completed by driving CS# high.  \n \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obtain the Device ID, the \ninstruction is the same as previously described, and shown in Figure 54 & Figure 55, except that \nafter CS# is driven high it must remain high for a time duration of t RES2 (See “11.6 AC Electrical \nCharacteristics ”). After this time duration the device will resume normal operation and other \ninstructions will be accepted. If the Release from Power -down / Device ID instruction is issued \nwhile an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (when WIP equals  1) the  instruction is \nignored and will not have any effect  on the current cycle.  \n \ntRES1\n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (ABh)\n      CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)         \nPower-down currentStand-by current\n \nFigure 52 Release Power -down Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\nABhCS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ3tRES1\nStand-by current Power-down current\n \nFigure 53 Release Power -down Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             51 \n \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (ABh)CS#\nCLK8       9              29     30     31 32     33     34     35     36     37     38        \n3 Dummy Bytes\nD0\n(DQ1)DI\n(DQ0)\n«tRES2 Mode 3\nMode 0\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 High Impedance«23     22              2       1       0 \nDevice ID      \n«=MSB Power-down currentStand-by current\n \nFigure 54 Release Power -down / Device ID Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \nX       X      X       X       X      X       4       0\nX      X       X       X      X       X       5       1   \nX       X       X      X      X       X       7       3     X       X       X      X      X       X       6       2    3 Dummy Bytes  \nDQ0CS#\nCLK\nDQ2DQ1\nDQ3Instruction\nABh0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7         8\n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\n    \nIOs switch from\nInput to Output\nDevice ID\nPower-down currentStand-by currenttRES2\n \nFigure 55 Release Power -down / Device ID Instructi on (QPI Mode)  \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             52 \n10.2.25.  Read Manufacturer / Device ID (90h)  \nThe Read Manufacturer/Device ID instruction is an alternative to the Release from Power -down / \nDevice  ID instruction that provides both the JEDEC assigned manufacturer ID and the specific \ndevice ID.  \n \nThe R ead Manufacturer/Device ID instruction is very similar to the Release from Power -down / \nDevice ID instruction. The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “90h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 of 000000h. A fter which, the \nManufacturer ID for Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group Co., Ltd  (A1h) and the Device ID \nare shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure \n56 & Figure 57.

Erase Security Sector  (44h)  \nThe FM25W 128 offers one 4x256 -byte Security Sector . These registers may be used by the system \nmanufacturers to store security and other important information separately from the main memory array.  \n \nThe Erase S ecurity Sector instruction is similar to the Sector Erase instruction. A Write Enable \ninstruction must be executed before the device will accept the Erase Security Sector Instruction \n(Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by d riving the CS# pin low and \nshifting the instruction code “44h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23 -A0 to erase the Security Sector.  \nA23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \n00h 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \n \nThe Erase Security Sector instruction sequence is shown in  Figure 64. The CS# pin must be driven high \nafter the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the instruction will not be executed. \nAfter CS# is driven high, the self -timed Erase Security Sector ope ration will commence for a time \nduration of t SE (See “ 11.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While the Erase Security Sector cycle is in \nprogress, the Read Status Registe r instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the WIP \nbit. The WIP bit is a 1 during the erase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device \nis ready to accept other instructions again. After the Erase Security Sector cyc le has finished the Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Security Sector Lock Bit (LB) in the \nStatus Register -2 can be used to OTP protect the Security Sector. Once a lock bit is set to 1, the \nSecurity Sector will be per manently locked  and Erase Security Sector instruction will be ignored.  \n \nDI\n(DQ1)DI\n(DQ0)CS#\nCLK\n«=MSBHigh Impedance23     22    2       1       0                                    \n«      Instruction (44h)0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 08       9 \n24-Bit Address29     30     31Mode 3\nMode 0\n \n Figure 64 Erase Security Sector Instruction (SPI Mode only)  \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             60 \n10.2.32.  Program Security Sector (42h)  \nThe Program Security Sector instruct ion is similar to the Page Program instruction. It allows from \none byte to 256 bytes of Security Sector data to be programmed at previously erased (FFh) \nmemory locations. A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the \nProgram  Security Sector Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the CS# pin low then shifting the instruction code “42h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23 -\nA0 and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. The CS# pin must be  held low for the entire length \nof the instruction while data is being sent to the device.  \n \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Sector  page0  00h 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Sector  page1  00h 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 1  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Sector  pag e2 00h 0 0 0 0  0 0 1 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Sector  page3  00h 0 0 0 0  0 0 1 1  Don’t Care  \n \nThe Program Security Sector instruction sequence is shown in  Figure 65.

Read Security Sector (48h)  \nThe Read Security Sector instruction is similar to the Fast Read instruction and allows one or \nmore data bytes to be sequentially read from the Security Sector. The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the CS# pin low and then shifting the instruction code “48h” followed by a 24 -bit address \nA23-A0 and eight “dummy” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the \nrising edge of the CLK pin.  \n \nAfter the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location will be shifted out \non the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The byte address is \nautomatically incremented to the next byte address after each byte of data i s shifted out. Once \nthe byte address reaches the last byte of the register (byte FFh), it will be reset to 00h, the first \nbyte of the register, and continue s to increment. The instruction is completed by driving CS# high. \nThe Read Security Sector instructi on sequence is shown in Figure 66.  \n \nIf a Read Security Sector instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in \nprocess (WIP =1) , the instruction is ignored and will not have any effect on the cur rent cycle. The \nRead Security Sector instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of FR (see “ 11.6 AC \nElectrical Characteristics ”). \n \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Sector  page0  00h 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Sector  page1  00h 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 1  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Sector  page 2 00h 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Don’t Care  \nSecurity Sector  page 3 00h 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 Don’t Care  \n \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (48h)CS#\nCLK8       9      10              28     29     30     31 \n24-Bit Address\nDI\n(DQ0)\n«23     22     21               3       2       1       0 \n«=MSBHigh Impedance DI\n(DQ1)\nCS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)0       7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0  \nDummy Byte39     40     41     42     43     44     45     46 47     48     49     50     51     52     53     54    55 31     32     33     34     35     36     37     38 \n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0       7\n« «7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 High Impendance DI\n(DQ1)Data Out 1 Data Out 2\n \nFigure 66 Read Security Sector Instruction (SPI Mode only)  \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             62 \n10.2.34.  Set Read Parameters (C0h)  \nIn QPI mode, to accommodate a wide range of applications with different needs for either \nmaximum read frequency or minimum data access latency, “ Set Read Parameters (C0h)” \ninstruction can be used to configure the number of dummy clocks for “Fast Read (0Bh)”, “Fast \nRead Quad I/O (EBh)” & “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instructions, and to configure the number \nof bytes of “Wrap Length” for the “Burst R ead with Wrap (0Ch)” instruction.  \n \nIn Standard SPI mode, the “Set Read Parameters (C0h)” instruction is not accepted. The dummy \nclocks for various Fast Read instructions in Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode are fixed, please refer \nto Table  8~Table 10 the Instruction set for details. The “Wrap Length” is set by W5 -4 bit in the \n“Set Burst with Wrap (77h)” instruction. This setting will remain unchanged when the device is \nswitched from Standard SPI mode to QPI mode.  \n \nThe def ault “Wrap Length” after a power up or a Reset instruction is 8 bytes, the default number \nof dummy clocks is 2.  \nP6 – P4 DUMMY \nCLOCKS  MAXIMUM READ \nFREQ.  \n0 0 0 2 50MHz  \n0 0 1 4 80MHz  \n0 1 0 6 100MHz \n0 1 1 8 100MHz \n P1 – P0 WRAP LENGTH  \n0 0 8-byte \n0 1 16-byte \n1 0 32-byte \n1 1 64-byte \n \nDQ0CS#\nCLK\nDQ2DQ1\nDQ3   P7     P3   P6     P2P5     P1P4     P0Read\nParametersInstruction\nC0h0       1       2       3  \n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\n \nFigure 67 Set Read Parameters Instruction (QPI Mode only)  \n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             63 \n10.2.35.

Enable QPI (38h)  \nThe FM25W 128 support  both Standard/Dual/Quad  Serial  Peripheral  Interface  (SPI)  and Quad \nPeripheral Interface (QPI). However, SPI mode and QPI mode can not be used at the same time. \n“Enable QPI (38h)” instruction is the only way to switch the devi ce from SPI mode to QPI mode.  \n \nUpon power -up, the default state of the device upon is Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode. In order to \nswitch the device to QPI mode, the Quad Enable (QE) bit in Status Register 2 must be set to 1 \nfirst, and an “Enable QPI (38h)” in struction must be issued. If the Quad Enable (QE) bit is 0, the \n“Enable QPI (38h)” instruction will be ignored and the device will remain in SPI mode.  \n \nSee “Table 10” for all the commands supported in QPI mode.  \n \nWhen the device is switched from SPI mode to QPI mode, the existing  Write Enable and \nProgram/Erase  Suspend status, and the Wrap Length setting will remain unchanged.  \nDI\n(DQ0)0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (38h)CLKCS#\nD0\n(DQ1)High Impedance\n \nFigure 69 Enable QPI Instruction (SPI M ode only)\n \n                   Datasheet  \nFM25W 128 128 M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                Preliminary                             64 \n10.2.37.

Enable Reset (66h) and Reset (99h)  \nFM25W 128 provide a software Reset instruction. Once the Reset inst ruction is accepted, any on -\ngoing internal operations will be terminated and the device will return to its default power -on state \nand lose all the current volatile settings, such as Volatile Status Register bits, Write Enable Latch \n(WEL) status, Read param eter setting P7 -P0, Continuous Read Mode bit setting M7 -M0 and \nWrap Bit setting W6 -W4. \n \n“Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” instructions can be issued in either SPI mode or QPI \nmode. To avoid accidental reset, both instructions must be issued in sequenc e. Any other \ncommands other than “Reset (99h)” after the “Enable Reset (66h)” command will disable the \n“Reset Enable” state. A new sequence of “Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” is needed to \nreset the device. Once the Reset command is accepted by the d evice, the device will take \napproximately 100μs to reset. During this period, no command will be accepted.  \n \nData corruption may happen if there is an on -going internal Erase or Program operation \nwhen Reset command sequence is accepted by the device.
