MIC5235\n \n  \nMay 2008  7 M9999-051508 Application Information \nEnable/Shutdown \nThe MIC5235 comes with an active-high enable pin that \nallows the regulator to be disabled. Forcing the enable pin low disables the regulator and sends it into a “zero” \noff-mode-current state. In th is state, current consumed \nby the regulator goes nearly to zero. Forcing the enable \npin high enables the output voltage. \nInput Capacitor \n The MIC5235 has high input voltage capability up to \n24V. The input capacitor must be rated to sustain \nvoltages that may be used on the input. An input \ncapacitor may be required when the device is not near the source power supply or when supplied by a battery. \nSmall, surface mount, ceramic capacitors can be used for bypassing. Larger values may be required if the source supply has high ripple. \nOutput Capacitor \nThe MIC5235 requires an output capacitor for stability. \nThe design requires 2.2µF or greater on the output to \nmaintain stability. The design is optimized for use with \nlow-ESR ceramic chip capacitors. High ESR capacitors may cause high frequency oscillation. The maximum \nrecommended ESR is 3 Ω. The output capacitor can be \nincreased without limit. Larger valued capacitors help to improve transient response. \nX7R/X5R dielectric-type ceramic capacitors are \nrecommended because of their temperature \nperformance. X7R-type capacitors change capacitance \nby 15% over their operat ing temperature range and are \nthe most stable type of ceramic capacitors. Z5U and \nY5V dielectric capacitors change value by as much as \n50% and 60% respectively over their operating temperature ranges. To use a ceramic chip capacitor \nwith Y5V dielectric, the value must be much higher than \na X7R ceramic capacitor to ensure the same minimum capacitance over the equivalent operating temperature \nrange. \nNo-Load Stability \nThe MIC5235 will remain stable and in regulation with no \nload unlike many other voltage regulators. This is \nespecially important in CMOS RAM keep-alive applications. \nThermal Considerations \nThe MIC5235 is designed to provide 150mA of \ncontinuous current in a very small package. Maximum \npower dissipation can be calculated based on the output current and the voltage drop across the part. To \ndetermine the maximum power dissipation of the \npackage, use the junction-to- ambient thermal resistance \nof the device and the following basic equation:  \n⎟⎟\n⎠⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝⎛−\n=\nJAA J(MAX)\nD(MAX)θT T\nP  \nTJ(MAX)  is the maximum junction temperature of the die, \n125°C, and T A is the ambient operating temperature. θ JA \nis layout dependent; Table 1 shows examples of the \njunction-to-ambient thermal re sistance for the MIC5235. \nPackage θJA Recommended \nMinimum Footprint \nSOT-23-5 235°C \nTable 1.  SOT-23-5 Thermal Resistance \nThe actual power dissipation of the regulator circuit can be determined using the equation: \n P\nD = (V IN – V OUT)IOUT + V INIGND \nSubstituting P D(MAX)  for P D and solving for the operating \nconditions that are critical to the application will give the \nmaximum operating conditions for the regulator circuit. \nFor example, when operating the MIC5235-3.0BM5 at 50°C with a minimum footprint layout, the maximum \ninput voltage for a set output current can be determined \nas follows: \n \n⎟\n⎠⎞⎜\n⎝⎛\n°° − °=C/W 235C 50 C 125PD(MAX)  \n P D(MAX)  = 319mW \nThe junction-to-ambient ( θJA) thermal resistance for the \nminimum footprint is 235°C/W, from Table 1. It is \nimportant that the maximum power dissipation not be \nexceeded to ensure proper operation. Since the \nMIC5235 was designed to operate with high input \nvoltages, careful consideration must be given so as not to overheat the device. With very high input-to-output \nvoltage differentials, the output current is limited by the \ntotal power dissipation. Total power dissipation is calculated using the following equation: \n P\nD = (V IN – V OUT)IOUT + V IN × I GND \nDue to the potential for input voltages up to 24V, ground \ncurrent must be taken into consideration. If we know the \nmaximum load current, we can solve for the maximum \ninput voltage using the maximum power dissipation \ncalculated for a 50°C ambient, 319mV. \n P D(MAX)  = (V IN – V OUT)IOUT + V IN x IGND \n 319mW = (V IN – 3V)150mA + V IN x 2.8mA \nGround pin current is estimated using the typical \ncharacteristics of the device. \n 769mW = V IN (152.8mA) \n V IN = 5.03V \nFor higher current outputs only a lower input voltage will \nwork for higher ambient temperatures. \nAssuming a lower output current of 20mA, the maximum \ninput voltage can be recalculated: \nMicrel, Inc.
