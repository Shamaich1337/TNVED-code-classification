Thesefunctions allow 21 bits of single-ended LVTTL data to be synchronously transmitted over 3 balanced-pairconductors for receipt by a compatible receiver, such as the SN75LVDS82 or SN75LVDS86/86A.\nWhen transmitting, data bits D0 – D20 are each loaded into registers of the ’LVDS84A upon the falling edge.\nThe internal PLL is frequency-locked to CLKIN and then used to unload the data registers in 7-bit slices. Thethree serial streams and a phase-locked clock (CLKOUT) are then output to LVDS output drivers. The frequencyof CLKOUT is the same as the input clock, CLKIN.\nCopyright \uf8e9 2001, Texas Instruments Incorporated PRODUCTION DATA information is current as of publication date.\nProducts conform to specifications per the terms of Texas Instruments\nstandard warranty.

The data bus appears the same at the\ninput to the transmitter and output of the receiver with the data transmission transparent to the user(s). The onlyuser intervention is the possible use of the shutdown/clear (SHTDN\n) active-low input to inhibit the clock and shut\noff the LVDS output drivers for lower power consumption. A low-level on this signal clears all internal registersto a low level.\nThe SN75LVDS84A is characterized for operation over ambient free-air temperatures of 0 °C to 70°C.

#### Description:
The **SN65LVDS84AQ** is a **FlatLink™ Transmitter** designed for high-speed data transmission using low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS). It integrates three 7-bit parallel-load serial-out shift registers and four LVDS line drivers into a single IC. This allows for the synchronous transmission of 21 bits of single-ended LVTTL data over three balanced-pair conductors to a compatible receiver.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Display Interfaces**: The SN65LVDS84AQ is particularly suited for transmitting data from graphics controllers to flat panel displays, supporting resolutions such as SVGA, XGA, and SXGA.
- **Automotive Applications**: Due to its wide operating temperature range and low power consumption, it is ideal for automotive high-reliability applications.
- **Data Communication**: It can be used in various data communication applications where low EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) and high data rates are required.

This component is a robust solution for applications requiring efficient data transmission with minimal power consumption and high reliability, making it suitable for both consumer electronics and automotive systems.
