In small \nsignal detector applications (P in < ‑20 dBm), this diode is \nused with DC bias at frequencies above 1.5 GHz. At lower \nfrequencies, the zero bias HSMS ‑285x family should be \nconsidered.\nIn large signal power or gain control applications \n(Pin> ‑20 dBm), this family is used without bias at \nfrequencies above 4 GHz. At lower frequencies, the \nHSMS ‑282x family is preferred.\nSchottky Barrier Diode Characteristics\nStripped of its package, a Schottky barrier diode chip \nconsists of a metal‑semiconductor barrier formed by \ndeposition of a metal layer on a semiconductor. The most \ncommon of several different types, the passivated diode, \nis shown in Figure 7, along with its equivalent circuit.The Height of the Schottky Barrier\nThe current ‑voltage character  istic of a Schottky barrier \ndiode at room temperature is described by the following \nequation:\nHSMS-285A/6A fig 9RS\nRjCjMETAL\nSCHOTTKY JUNCTIO NPASSIVATION PASSIVATION\nN-TYPE OR P-TYPE EPI    LAYER\nN-TYPE OR P-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATE\nCROSS-SECTION OF SCHOTTK Y\nBARRIER DIODE CHIPEQUIVALENT\nCIRCUIT\nFigure 7. Schottky Diode Chip.\nRS is the parasitic series resistance of the diode, the sum \nof the bondwire and leadframe resistance, the resistance \nof the bulk layer of silicon, etc. RF energy coupled into \nRS is lost as heat — it does not contribute to the rectified \noutput of the diode. C J is parasitic junction capaci tance \nof the diode, controlled by the thickness of the epitaxial \nlayer and the diameter of the Schottky contact. R j is the \njunction resistance of the diode, a function of the total \ncurrent flowing through it.RSRV\nCj\nFigure 8. Equivalent Circuit of a Schottky Diode Chip.\nRS is perhaps the easiest to measure accurately. The V ‑I \ncurve is measured for the diode under forward bias, and \nthe slope of the curve is taken at some relatively high \nvalue of current (such as 5 mA). This slope is converted \ninto a resistance R d.       8.33 X 10-5 nTRj =    = RV - RsIS + Ib\n0.026  =  at 25 °C\nIS + Ib\nV - IRSI = IS (exp ( ) - 1)\n0.026       8.33 X 10-5 nTRj =    = RV - RsIS + Ib\n0.026  =  at 25 °C\nIS + Ib\nV - IRSI = IS (exp ( ) - 1)\n0.026\nwhere  \nn = ideality factor (see table of SPICE parameters)  \nT = temperature in °K  \nIS = saturation current  (see table of SPICE parameters)\nIb = externally applied bias  current in amps\nIS is a function of diode barrier height, and can range \nfrom picoamps for high barrier diodes to as much as 5 \nµA for very low barrier diodes.On a semi‑log plot (as shown in the Avago catalog) the \ncurrent graph will be a straight line with inverse slope \n2.3 X 0.026 = 0.060 volts per cycle (until the effect of R S is \nseen in a curve that droops at high current). All Schottky \ndiode curves have the same slope, but not necessar ‑\nily the same value of current for a given voltage. This is \ndeter  mined by the saturation current, I S, and is related to \nthe barrier height of the diode.\nThrough the choice of p ‑type or n‑type silicon, and the \nselection of metal, one can tailor the characteristics of a \nSchottky diode. Barrier height will be altered, and at the \nsame time C J and R S will be changed. In general, very \nlow barrier height diodes (with high values of I S, suitable \nfor zero bias applica  tions) are realized on p ‑type silicon. \nSuch diodes suffer from higher values of R S than do \nthe n‑type. Thus, p ‑type diodes are generally reserved \nfor small signal detector applications (where very high \nvalues of R V swamp out high R S) and n‑type diodes are \nused for mixer applications (where high L.O. drive levels \nkeep R V low) and DC biased detectors.\nMeasuring Diode Linear Parameters\nThe measurement of the many elements which make \nup the equivalent circuit for a pack  aged Schottky diode \nis a complex task. Various techniques are used for each \nelement. The task begins with the elements of the diode \nchip itself. (See Figure 8).\nRV = Rj + RS0.026RS = R d -  \nIf\nFor n‑type diodes with relatively low values of saturation \ncurrent, C j is obtained by measuring the total capaci ‑\ntance (see AN1124). R j, the junction resistance, is calcu ‑\nlated using the equation given above.\n7The characterization of the surface mount package is \ntoo complex to describe here — linear equivalent circuits \ncan be found in AN1124.\nDetector Circuits  (small signal)\nWhen DC bias is available, Schottky diode detector \ncircuits can be used to create low cost RF and \nmicrowave receivers with a sensitivity of ‑55 dBm to  \n‑57 dBm.[1] Moreover, since external DC bias sets the \nvideo impedance of such circuits, they display classic \nsquare law response over a wide range of input power \nlevels[2,3]. These circuits can take a variety of forms, but \nin the most simple case they appear as shown in Figure \n9. This is the basic detector circuit used with the HSMS ‑\n286x family of diodes.\nOutput voltage can be virtually doubled and input \nimpedance (normally very high) can be halved through \nthe use of the voltage doubler circuit[4].\nIn the design of such detector circuits, the starting point \nis the equivalent circuit of the diode. Of interest in the \ndesign of the video portion of the circuit is the diode’s \nvideo impedance — the other elements of the equiv ‑\nalent circuit disappear at all reasonable video frequen ‑\ncies. In general, the lower the diode’s video impedance, \nthe better the design.The situation is somewhat more complicated in the \ndesign of the RF impedance matching net  work, which \nincludes the pack  age inductance and capacitance \n(which can be tuned out), the series resistance, the \njunction capacitance and the video resistance. Of the \nelements of the diode’s equiv  alent circuit, the parasitics \nare constants and the video resistance is a function of \nthe current flowing through the diode.  \n[1] Avago Application Note 923, Schottky Barrier Diode Video \nDetectors.\n[2] Avago Application Note 986, Square Law and Linear Detection.\n[3] Avago Application Note 956‑5, Dynamic Range Extension of Schottky \nDetectors.\n[4] Avago Application Note 956‑4, Schottky Diode Voltage Doubler.\n[5] Avago Application Note 963, Impedance Matching Techniques for \nMixers and Detectors.HSMS-285A/6A fig 12VIDEO\nOUTRF\nINZ-MATCH\nNETWORKL1DC BIAS\nVIDEO\nOUTZ-MATCH\nNETWORKL1DC BIAS\nRF\nIN\nFigure 9.

RV = Rj + RS0.026RS = R d -  \nIf\nThe sum of saturation current and bias current sets \nthe detection sensitivity, video resistance and input RF \nimpedance of the Schottky detector diode. Where bias \ncurrent is used, some tradeoff in sensitivity and square \nlaw dynamic range is seen, as shown in Figure 5 and \ndescribed in reference [3].\nThe most difficult part of the design of a detector circuit \nis the input impedance matching network. For very \nbroadband detectors, a shunt 60 Ω resistor will give good \ninput match, but at the expense of detection sensitivity.\nWhen maximum sensitivity is required over a narrow \nband of frequencies, a reactive matching network is \noptimum. Such net  works can be realized in either lumped \nor distributed elements, depending upon frequency, \nsize constraints and cost limitations, but certain general \ndesign principals exist for all types.[5] Design work begins \nwith the RF impedance of the HSMS ‑286x series when \nbias current is set to 3 µA. See Figure 10. \n8915 MHz Detector Circuit\nFigure 11 illustrates a simple impedance matching network \nfor a 915 MHz detector.The HSMS ‑282x family is a better choice for 915 MHz ap ‑\nplications—the foregoing discussion of a design using \nthe HSMS ‑286B is offered only to illustrate a design \napproach for technique.\nHSMS-285A/6A fig 1465nH\n100 pFVIDEO\nOUTRF\nINPUT\nWIDTH = 0.050"LENGTH = 0.065"\nWIDTH = 0.015"LENGTH = 0.600"\nTRANSMISSION LINEDIMENSIONS ARE FOR\nMICROSTRIP ON\n0.032" THICK FR-4.\nHSMS-285A/6A fig 15FREQUENCY (GHz): 0.9-0.93\nHSMS-285A/6A fig 16RETURN LOSS (dB)\n0.9-20\nFREQUENCY (GHz)0.9150\n-10\n-15\n0.93-5100 pFVIDEO\nOUTRF\nINPUT\nWIDTH = 0.017"\nLENGTH = 0.436"\nWIDTH = 0.078"\nLENGTH = 0.165"\nTRANSMISSION LINE\nDIMENSIONS ARE FOR\nMICROSTRIP ON\n0.032" THICK FR-4.\n0.030" PLATED THROUGH HOLE,\n3 PLACES0.094" THROUGH, 4 PLACES\nFINISHED\nBOARD\nSIZE IS\n1.00" X 1.00".

The short length of 0.065” wide \nmicrostrip line is used to mount the lead of the diode’s \nSOT‑323 package. A shorted shunt stub of length <λ/4 \nprovides the necessary shunt inductance and simul‑\ntaneously provides the return circuit for the current \ngenerated in the diode. The impedance of this circuit is \ngiven in Figure 12.\nFigure 12. Input Impedance.\nThe input match, expressed in terms of return loss, is \ngiven in Figure 13.\nFigure 13.

Physical Realization.\n2.45 GHz Detector Circuit\nAt 2.45 GHz, the RF impedance is closer to the line of \nconstant susceptance which passes through the center \nof the chart, resulting in a design which is realized \nentirely in distributed elements — see Figure 14.\nIn order to save cost (at the expense of having a larger \ncircuit), an open circuit shunt stub could be substituted \nfor the chip capacitor. On the other hand, if space is at a \npremium, the long series transmission line at the input \nto the diode can be replaced with a lumped inductor. A \npossible physical realization of such a network is shown \nin Figure 15, a demo board is available from Avago.\nCHIP CAPACITOR, 20 TO 100 pFHSMS-2860\nHSMS-285X fig 20 was 17VIDEO OUT RF IN\nFigure 16.

As \nwas the case with the lower frequency design, bandwidth \nis more than adequate for the intended RFID application.\nFigure 18. Input Return Loss, 3 µA Bias.\nA word of caution to the designer is in order. A glance \nat Figure 17 will reveal the fact that the circuit does \nnot provide the optimum impedance to the diode at \n2.45 GHz. The temptation will be to adjust the circuit \nelements to achieve an ideal single frequency match, as \nillustrated in Figure 19.Figure 20. Input Return Loss. Modified 2.45 GHz Circuit.\nHowever, bandwidth is narrower and the designer runs \nthe risk of a shift in the mid band frequency of his circuit \nif there is any small deviation in circuit board or diode \ncharacter  istics due to lot ‑to‑lot variation or change in \ntemper ‑ature. The matching technique illustrated in \nFigure 17 is much less sensitive to changes in diode and \ncircuit board processing.\n5.8 GHz Detector Circuit\nA possible design for a 5.8 GHz detector is given in Figure \n21.\n20 pFVIDEO\nOUTRF\nINPUT\nWIDTH = 0.016"LENGTH = 0.037"\nWIDTH = 0.045"\nLENGTH = 0.073"\nTRANSMISSION LINEDIMENSIONS ARE FORMICROSTRIP ON\n0.032" THICK FR-4. Figure 21. 5.8 GHz Matching Network for the HSMS -286x Series at 3 µA Bias.\n10As was the case at 2.45 GHz, the circuit is entirely dis ‑\ntributed element, both low cost and compact. Input \nimpedance for this network is given in Figure 22.Such a circuit offers several advantages. First the voltage \noutputs of two diodes are added in series, increasing \nthe overall value of voltage sensitivity for the network \n(compared to a single diode detector). Second, the RF \nimpedances of the two diodes are added in parallel, \nmaking the job of reactive matching a bit easier. Such a \ncircuit can easily be realized using the two series diodes \nin the HSMS‑286C.\nThe “Virtual Battery”\nThe voltage doubler can be used as a virtual battery, \nto provide power for the operation of an I.C. or a tran ‑\nsistor oscillator in a tag. Illuminated by the CW signal \nfrom a reader or inter  rogator, the Schottky circuit will \nproduce power sufficient to operate an I.C. or to charge \nup a capacitor for a burst transmis sion from an oscilla ‑\ntor. Where such virtual batteries are employed, the bulk, \ncost, and limited lifetime of a battery are eliminated.\nTemperature Compensation\nThe compression of the detector’s transfer curve is \nbeyond the scope of this data sheet, but some general \ncomments can be made. As was given earlier, the diode’s \nvideo resistance is given by\n                            8.33 x 10‑5 nT\n RV =\n             I S + I b \nwhere T is the diode’s temperature in °K.\nAs can be seen, temperature has a strong effect upon R V, \nand this will in turn affect video bandwidth and input \nRF impedance. A glance at Figure 6 suggests that the \nproper choice of bias current in the HSMS ‑286x series \ncan minimize variation over  temperature.\nThe detector circuits described earlier were tested \nover temperature. The 915 MHz voltage doubler using \nthe HSMS ‑286C series produced the output voltages \nas shown in Figure 25. The use of 3 µA of bias resulted \nin the highest voltage sensitivity, but at the cost of a \nwide variation over temperature. Dropping the bias to \n1 µA produced a detector with much less temperature \nvariation.\nA similar experiment was conducted with the HSMS ‑\n286B series in the 5.8 GHz detector. Once again, reducing \nthe bias to some level under 3 µA stabilized the output \nof the detector over a wide temperature range.\nIt should be noted that curves such as those given in \nFigures 25 and 26 are highly dependent upon the exact \ndesign of the input impedance matching network. The \ndesigner will have to experiment with bias current using \nhis specific design.HSMS-0005 fig 26 was 23FREQUENCY (GHz): 5.6-6.0\nHSMS-285X fig 27 was 24RETURN LOSS (dB)\n5.6-20\nFREQUENCY (GHz)5.80\n-10\n-15\n6.0-5\n5.9 5.7\nHSMS-285X fig 11 was 7VIDEO OUTZ-MATCH\nNETWORKRF INFigure 22.

A glance at Figure 9, however, \nwill lead to the suggestion that the two types of single \ndiode detectors be combined into a two diode voltage \ndoubler[4] (known also as a full wave rectifier).

Comparing Two Diodes.\nThe HSMS ‑286K, with leads 2 and 5 grounded, offers \nsome isolation from RF coupling between the diodes. \nThis product is used in a differential detector as shown \nin Figure 30.\nFigure 30. High Isolation Differential Detector.\nIn order to achieve the maximum isolation, the designer \nmust take care to minimize the distance from leads 2 \nand 5 and their respective ground via holes.\nTests were run on the HSMS ‑282K and the conventional \nHSMS ‑2825 pair, which compare with each other in the \nsame way as the HSMS ‑2865 and HSMS ‑286K, with the \nresults shown in Figure 31.\nFigure 31. Comparing HSMS-282K with HSMS-2825.\n12The line marked “RF diode, V out” is the transfer curve for \nthe detector diode — both the HSMS‑2825 and the HSMS ‑\n282K exhibited the same output voltage. The data were \ntaken over the 50 dB dynamic range shown. To the right \nis the output voltage (transfer) curve for the reference \ndiode of the HSMS ‑2825, showing 37 dB of isolation. To \nthe right of that is the output voltage due to RF leakage \nfor the reference diode of the HSMS ‑282K, demonstrating \n10 dB higher isolation than the conventional part.\nSuch differential detector circuits generally use single \ndiode  detectors, either series or shunt mounted diodes. \nThe voltage doubler offers the advantage of twice \nthe output voltage for a given input power. The two \nconcepts can be combined into the differential voltage \ndoubler, as shown in Figure 32.PRF = RF power dissipated\nNote that θjc, the thermal resistance from diode junction \nto the foot of the leads, is the sum of two component \nresistances,\nmatchin g\nnetworkbias\ndifferential\namplifier\nFigure 32. Differential Voltage Doubler, HSMS-286P .\nHere, all four diodes of the HSMS‑286P are matched in \ntheir V f characteristics, because they came from adjacent \nsites on the wafer. A similar circuit can be realized using \nthe HSMS ‑286R ring quad.\nOther configurations of six lead Schottky products can \nbe used to solve circuit design problems while saving \nspace and cost.\nThermal Considerations\nThe obvious advantage of the SOT ‑363 over the SOT ‑\n143 is combination of smaller size and two extra leads. \nHowever, the copper leadframe in the SOT ‑323 and SOT ‑\n363 has a thermal conductivity four times higher than \nthe Alloy 42 leadframe of the SOT ‑23 and SOT ‑143, which \nenables it to dissipate more power.\nThe maximum junction temperature for these three \nfamilies of Schottky diodes is 150°C under all operating \nconditions. The following equation, equation 1, applies \nto the thermal analysis of diodes:\n11600 (Vf- If Rs)\nnTIf = IS   e                              - 1Equation (3).\n2   1        1\nn    - 4060 (T- 298)\nIs = I0 (  T  )   e  298Equation (4).Tj = (VfIf + PRF)θjc + Ta Equation (1).\nθjc = θpkg + θchip Equation (2).11600 (Vf- If Rs)\nnTIf = IS   e                              - 1Equation (3).\n2   1        1\nn    - 4060 (T- 298)\nIs = I0 (  T  )   e  298Equation (4).Tj = (VfIf + PRF)θjc + Ta Equation (1).\nθjc = θpkg + θchip Equation (2).\n11600 (Vf- If Rs)\nnTIf = IS   e                              - 1Equation (3).\n2   1        1\nn    - 4060 (T- 298)\nIs = I0 (  T  )   e  298Equation (4).Tj = (VfIf + PRF)θjc + Ta Equation (1).\nθjc = θpkg + θchip Equation (2).\n11600 (Vf- If Rs)\nnTIf = IS   e                              - 1Equation (3).\n2   1        1\nn    - 4060 (T- 298)\nIs = I0 (  T  )   e  298Equation (4).Tj = (VfIf + PRF)θjc + Ta Equation (1).\nθjc = θpkg + θchip Equation (2).\nwhere  \nTj = junction temperature\nTa = diode case temperature\nθjc = thermal resistance\nVfIf = DC power dissipatedPackage thermal resistance for the SOT ‑323 and SOT ‑363 \npackage is approximately 100°C/W, and the chip thermal \nresistance for these three families of diodes is approxi ‑\nmately 40°C/W. The designer will have to add in the \nthermal  resistance from diode case to ambient — a poor \nchoice of circuit board material or heat sink design can \nmake this number very high.\nEquation (1) would be straightforward to solve but \nfor the fact that diode forward voltage is a function of \ntemperature as well as forward current. The equation, \nequation 3, for V f is:\nwhere\nn = ideality factor\nT = temperature in °K\nRs = diode series resistance\nand I S (diode saturation current) is given by\nEquations (1) and (3) are solved simultaneously to obtain \nthe value of junction temperature for given values of \ndiode case temperature, DC power dissipation and RF \npower dissipation.\n13Diode Burnout\nAny Schottky junction, be it an RF diode or the gate of \na MESFET, is relatively delicate and can be burned out \nwith excessive RF power. Many crystal video receivers \nused in RFID (tag) applications find themselves in poorly \ncontrolled environments where high power sources may \nbe present. Examples are the areas around airport and \nFAA radars, nearby ham radio operators, the vicinity of \na broadcast band transmitter, etc. In such environments, \nthe Schottky diodes of the receiver can be protected by \na device known as a limiter diode.[6] Formerly available \nonly in radar warning receivers and other high cost \nelectronic warfare applications, these diodes have been \nadapted to commercial and consumer circuits.\nAvago offers a com plete line of surface mountable PIN \nlimiter diodes. Most notably, our HSMP ‑4820 (SOT ‑23) \nor HSMP ‑482B (SOT ‑323) can act as a very fast (nano ‑\nsecond) power ‑sensitive switch when placed between \nthe antenna and the Schottky diode, shorting out the \nRF circuit temporarily and reflecting the excessive RF \nenergy back out the antenna.\nFigure 34.

Surface Mount Assembly Profile.SMT Assembly \nReliable assembly of surface mount components is a \ncomplex process that involves many material, process, \nand equipment factors, including: method of heating \n(e.g., IR or vapor phase reflow, wave soldering, etc.) \ncircuit board material, conductor thickness and pattern, \ntype of solder alloy, and the thermal conductivity and \nthermal mass of components. Components with a low \nmass, such as the SOT packages, will reach solder reflow \ntemperatures faster than those with a greater mass. \nAvago’s diodes have been qualified to the time ‑tem ‑\nperature profile shown in Figure 35. This profile is repre ‑\nsentative of an IR reflow type of surface mount assembly \nprocess.\nAfter ramping up from room temperature, the circuit \nboard with components attached to it (held in place \nwith solder paste) passes through one or more preheat \n25\nTimeTemperatureTp\nTLtp\ntL\nt 25° C to PeakRamp-up\ntsTsmin\nRamp-down\nPreheatCritical Zone\nTL to Tp\nTsmax\nLead-Free Reflow Profile Recommendation (IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020C)\nReflow Parameter Lead-Free Assembly\nAverage ramp ‑up rate (Liquidus Temperature (T S(max)  to Peak) 3°C/ second max\nPreheat Temperature Min (T S(min) ) 150°C\nTemperature Max (T S(max) ) 200°C\nTime (min to max) (t S) 60‑180 seconds\nTs(max) to TL Ramp ‑up Rate 3°C/second max\nTime maintained above: Temperature (T L) 217°C\nTime (t L) 60‑150 seconds\nPeak Temperature (T P) 260 +0/‑5°C\nTime within 5 °C of actual Peak temperature (t P) 20‑40 seconds\nRamp ‑down Rate 6°C/second max\nTime 25 °C to Peak Temperature 8 minutes max\nNote 1: All temperatures refer to topside of the package, measured on the package body surfacezones. The preheat zones increase the temperature of \nthe board and components to prevent thermal shock \nand begin evaporating solvents from the solder paste. \nThe reflow zone briefly elevates the temperature suffi ‑\nciently to produce a reflow of the solder. \nThe rates of change of temperature for the ramp ‑up and \ncool‑ down zones are chosen to be low enough to not \ncause deformation of the board or damage to compo ‑\nnents due to thermal shock. The maximum temperature \nin the reflow zone (T MAX) should not exceed 260°C. \nThese parameters are typical for a surface mount assembly \nprocess for Avago diodes. As a general guideline, the circuit \nboard and components should be exposed only to the \nminimum temperatures and times necessary to achieve a \nuniform reflow of solder. \n15Package Dimensions\nOutline 23 (SOT-23)\nOutline 143 (SOT-143) Outline SOT-363 (SC-70 6 Lead)Outline SOT-323 (SC-70 3 Lead)\neBe2\nB1e1\nE1\nCEXXX\nL\nD\nA\nA1\nNotes:\nXXX-package markingDrawings are not to scaleDIMENSIONS (mm)\nMIN.\n0.79\n0.013\n0.360.76\n0.086\n2.801.200.891.78\n0.45\n2.10\n0.45MAX.\n1.097\n0.10\n0.54\n0.92\n0.152\n3.061.401.022.04\n0.60\n2.65\n0.69SYMBOL\nA\nA1\nB\nB1\nC\nD\nE1\ne\ne1\ne2\nE\nLe\nBe2\ne1\nE1\nCEXXX\nL\nD\nA\nA1\nNotes:\nXXX-package markingDrawings are not to scaleDIMENSIONS (mm)\nMIN.\n0.79\n0.000\n0.300.082.731.150.891.78\n0.45\n2.10\n0.45MAX.\n1.20\n0.100\n0.540.203.131.501.022.04\n0.60\n2.70\n0.69SYMBOL\nA\nA1\nB\nC\nD\nE1\ne\ne1\ne2\nE\nLe\nBe1\nE1\nCEXXX\nL\nD\nA\nA1\nNotes:\nXXX-package markingDrawings are not to scaleDIMENSIONS (mm)\nMIN.\n0.800.00\n0.15\n0.081.801.10\n1.80\n0.26MAX.\n1.00\n0.10\n0.40\n0.252.251.40\n2.40\n0.46SYMBOL\nA\nA1\nB\nC\nD\nE1\ne\ne1\nE\nL\n1.30 typical0.65 typical\nE HE\nDe\nA1\nbA A2DIMENSIONS (mm)\nMIN.\n1.15\n1.80\n1.800.800.800.00\n0.15\n0.08\n0.10MAX.\n1.35\n2.25\n2.401.101.000.10\n0.30\n0.25\n0.46SYMBOL\nE\nD\nHE\nA\nA2\nA1\ne\nb\nc\nL\n0.650 BCSL\nc\n16Device Orientation  \nUSER\nFEED \nDIRECTION\nCOVER TAPECARRIER\nTAPE REEL \nFor Outline SOT-143For Outlines SOT-23, -323\nNote: "AB" represents package marking code.\n           "C" represents date code.END VIE W\n8 mm4 mmTOP VIEW\nABC ABC ABC ABC\nEND VIE W\n8 mm4 mmTOP VIEW\nNote: "AB" represents package marking code.\n           "C" represents date code.ABC ABC ABC ABCFor Outline SOT-363\nNote: "AB" represents package marking code.\n           "C" re presents date code.END VIE W\n8 mm4 mmTOP VIEWABC ABC ABC ABC\n17Tape Dimensions and Product Orientation  \nFor Outline SOT-23\n9° MAX\nA0P\nP0D P2\nE\nF\nW\nD1\nKo 8° MAX\nB013.5° MAXt1\nDESCRIPTION SYMBOL SIZE (mm) SIZE (INCHES)\nLENGTH\nWIDTH\nDEPTH\nPITCH\nBOTTOM HOLE DIAMETERA0\nB0\nK0\nPD\n13.15 ± 0.10\n2.77 ± 0.10\n1.22 ± 0.10\n4.00 ± 0.10\n1.00 + 0 .050.124 ± 0.004\n0.109 ± 0.004\n0.048 ± 0.004\n0.157 ± 0.004\n0.039 ± 0.002CAVITY\nDIAMETER\nPITCH\nPOSITIOND\nP0\nE1.50 + 0.104.00 ± 0.10\n1.75 ± 0.100.059 + 0.004\n0.157 ± 0.004\n0.069 ± 0.004PERFORATION\nWIDTH\nTHICKNESSW\nt18.00 + 0.30 – 0.10\n0.229 ± 0.0130.315 + 0.012 – 0.004\n0.009 ± 0.0005CARRIER TAPE\nCAVITY TO PERFORATION\n(WIDTH DIRECTION )\nCAVITY TO PERFORATION\n(LENGTH DIRECTION)F\nP\n23.50 ± 0.05\n2.00 ± 0.050.138 ± 0.0020.079 ± 0.002DISTANCE\nBETWEEN\nCENTERLINE\nFor Outline SOT-143\nWFEP2P0DP\nD1\nDESCRIPTION SYMBOL SIZE (mm) SIZE (INCHES)\nLENGTH\nWIDTH\nDEPTH\nPITCH\nBOTTOM HOLE DIAMETERA0\nB0\nK0\nPD\n13.19 ± 0.10\n2.80 ± 0.10\n1.31 ± 0.10\n4.00 ± 0.10\n1.00 + 0 .250.126 ± 0.004\n0.110 ± 0.004\n0.052 ± 0.004\n0.157 ± 0.004\n0.039 + 0.010CAVITY\nDIAMETER\nPITCH\nPOSITIOND\nP0\nE1.50 + 0.10\n4.00 ± 0.10\n1.75 ± 0.100.059 + 0.004\n0.157 ± 0.004\n0.069 ± 0.004PERFORATION\nWIDTH\nTHICKNESSW\nt18.00 + 0.30 – 0.10\n0.254 ± 0.0130.315+  0.012 – 0.004\n0.0100 ± 0.0005CARRIER TAPE\nCAVITY TO PERFORATION\n(WIDTH DIRECTION )\nCAVITY TO PERFORATION\n(LENGTH DIRECTION)F\nP23.50 ± 0.052.00 ± 0.050.138 ± 0.0020.079 ± 0.002DISTANCEA09° MAX 9° MAXt1\nB0K0\nTape Dimensions and Product Orientation  \nFor Outlines SOT-323, -363\nP\nP0P2\nF\nW\nC\nD1D\nE\nA0Ant1 (CARRIER TAPE THICKNESS) Tt (COVER TAPE THICKNESS)\nAn\nB0K0\nDESCRIPTION SYMBOL SIZE (mm) SIZE (INCHES)\nLENGTH\nWIDTHDEPTH\nPITCHBOTTOM HOLE DIAMETERA\n0\nB0\nK0\nPD\n12.40 ± 0.102.40 ± 0.10\n1.20 ± 0.10\n4.00 ± 0.10\n1.00 + 0.250.094 ± 0.004\n0.094 ± 0.004\n0.047 ± 0.004\n0.157 ± 0.004\n0.039 + 0.010CAVITY\nDIAMETER\nPITCH\nPOSITIOND\nP0\nE1.55 ± 0.05\n4.00 ± 0.101.75 ± 0.100.061 ± 0.0020.157 ± 0.0040.069 ± 0.004PERFORATION\nWIDTHTHICKNESSWt\n18.00 ± 0.30\n0.254 ± 0.020.315 ± 0.0120.0100 ± 0.0008CARRIER TAPE\nCAVITY TO PERFORATION\n(WIDTH DIRECTION)\nCAVITY TO PERFORATION\n(LENGTH DIRECTION)F\nP\n23.50 ± 0.052.00 ± 0.050.138 ± 0.0020.079 ± 0.002DISTANCE\nFOR SOT-323 (SC70-3 LEAD) An 8°C MAX\nFOR SOT-363 (SC70-6 LEAD) 10°C MAXANGLEWIDTH\nTAPE THICKNESSCT\nt5.4 ± 0.100.062 ± 0.0010.205 ± 0.0040.0025 ± 0.00004COVER TAPE\nFor product information and a complete list of distributors, please go to our web site:         www.avagotech.com\nAvago, Avago Technologies, and the A logo are trademarks of Avago Technologies in the United States and other countries.\nData subject to change.
