F | Page 6  of 12 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe AD1580 uses the band gap concept to produce a stable,  \nlow temperature coefficient volt age reference suitable for high \naccuracy data acquisition components and systems. The device \nmakes use of the underlying physical nature of a silicon tran -\nsistor base emitter voltage in the forward biased operating region. All such transistors have an appr oximately −2 mV/°C \ntemperature coefficient (TC) , which is unsuitable for use \ndirectly as a low TC reference; however, extrapolation of  the temperature characteristic of any one of these devices to absolute zero (with collector current proportional to abso lute \ntemperature) reveals that its V\nBE goes to approximately the \nsilicon band gap voltage. Thus, if a voltage could be developed with an opposing temperature coefficient to sum with V\nBE, a \nzero TC reference would result. The AD1580 circuit in Figure  10 \nprovides such a compensating voltage, V1, by driving two transistors at different current densities and amplifying the resultant V\nBE difference ( ∆V BE, which has a positive TC).  \nThe sum of V BE and V1 provides a stable voltage reference.  \nV+\nV–V1\nΔVBE\nVBE\n00700-010 \nFigure  10. Schematic Diagram  \nAPPLYING THE AD1580 \nThe AD1580 is simple to use in virtually all applications. To operate the AD1580 as a co nventional shunt regulator (see \nFigure 11), an external series resistor is connected between the \nsupply voltage and the AD1580. For a given supply voltage, the \nseries resistor, R\nS, determines the reverse current flowing through  \nthe AD1580. The value of R S must be chosen to accommodate \nthe expected variations of the supply voltage, V S; load current, \nIL; and the AD1580 reverse voltage, V R; while maintaining an \nacceptable reverse current, I R, through the AD1580.  \nThe minimum value for R S should be chosen when V S is at  \nits minimum and I L and V R are at their maximum, while \nmaintaining the minimum acceptable reverse current.  \nThe value of R S should be large enough to limit I R to 10 mA \nwhen V S is at its maximum and I L and V R are at their m inimum.  \nThe equation for selecting R S is as follows: \nRS = (V S − VR)/(IR + IL) \n Figure 12 shows a typical connection of the AD1580BRT \noperating at a minimum of 100 µA. This connection can \nprovide ±1 mA to the load while accommodating ±10%  \npower supply variations.  \nVS\nIR+IL RS\nVOUTIL\nVR\nIR\n00700-011 \nFigure 11.

Typical Connection Diagram  \nTEMPERATURE PERFORMA NCE  \nThe AD1580 is designed for reference applications where stable temperature performance is important. Extensive temperature \ntesting and characterization ensure that the device’s performance  is \nmaintained over the specified temperature range.  \nSome confusion exists in the area of defining and specifying \nreference voltage error over temperature. Historically, references have been chara cterized using a maximum deviation per degree \nCelsius, for  example, 50 ppm/°C. However, because of nonlinear -\nities in temperature characteristics that originated in standard \nZener references (such as S type characteristics), most manufac -\nturers now use a m aximum limit error band approach to specify \ndevices. This technique involves the measurement of the output at three or more different temperatures to guarantee that the voltage falls within the given error band. The proprietary curvature correction design techniques used to minimize the \nAD1580 nonlinearities allow the temperature performance to \nbe guaranteed using the maximum deviation method. This \nmethod is of more use to a designer than the one that simply \nguarantees the maximum error band over the entire  temper -\nature change.  \nFigure 13 shows a typical output voltage drift for the AD1580 \nand illustrates the methodology. The maximum slope of the two \ndiagonals drawn from the initial output value at +25°C to the \noutput values at +85°C  and −40°C determines the performance \ngrade of the device. For a given grade of the AD1580, the designer  \ncan easily determine the maximum total error from the initial \ntolerance plus temperature variation.  \n  AD1580 \n \nRev.

Output Voltag e vs. Temperature  \nFor example, the AD1580BRT initial tolerance is ±1 mV;  \na ±50  ppm/°C temperature coefficient corresponds to an  \nerror band of ±4 mV (50 × 10−6 × 1.225 V × 65°C). Thus, the \nunit is guaranteed to be 1.225 V ± 5 mV over the operating \ntempera ture range.  \nDuplication of these results requires a combination of high \naccuracy and stable temperature control in a test system. \nEvaluation of the AD1580 produces a curve similar to that  \nin Figure 5 and Figure 13. \nVOLTAGE OUTPUT NONLINEARITY vs . \nTEMPERATURE  \nWhen a reference is used with data converters, it is important to \nunderstand how temperature drift affects the overall converter performance. The nonlinearity of the reference output drift represents an additional error that is not easily calibrated out of  \nthe system. This characteristic (see Figure 14) is generated by \nnormalizing the measured drift characteristic to the end point average drift. The residual drift error o f approximately 500 ppm \nshows that the AD1580 is compatible with systems that require \n10-bit accurate temperature performance.  \n600\n300\n0RESIDUAL DRIFT ERROR (ppm)500\n400\n200\n100\n–55 –35 –15 5 25 45 65 85 105 125\nTEMPERA TURE(°C)\n00700-014\n \nFigure 14. Residual Drift Error  REVERSE VOLTAGE HYST ERESIS  \nA major requirement for high performance i ndustrial \nequipment manufacturers is a consistent output voltage at \nnominal temperature following operation over the operating temperature range. This characteristic is generated by measur -\ning the difference between the output voltage at +25°C after operat ion at +85°C and the output, at +25°C after operation  \nat −40°C. Figure 15 displays the hysteresis associated with the \nAD1580. This characteristic exists in all references and has been \nminimized in the AD1580.

Figu re 17 shows the \n0.1 Hz to 10 Hz noise of a typical AD1580. Noise in a 10 Hz to \n10 kHz bandwidth is approximately 20 μV rms (see Figure 18a). \nIf further noise reduction is desired, a 1 -pole low -pass filter can \nbe added between the output pin and ground. A time constant \nof 0.2 ms has a −3 dB point at about 800 Hz and reduces the \nhigh frequency no ise to about 6.5 μV rms (see Figure 18b).  \nA time constant of 960 ms has a −3 dB point at 165  Hz and \nreduces the high frequency noise to about 2.9  μV rms (see \nFigure 18c).  \n1s/DIV 1µV/DIV4.5µVp-p\n00700-017 \nFigure 17. 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz Voltage Noise  \n \n40µV/DIV 21µVrms\n20µV/DIV\n10µV/DIV\n10ms /DIV6.5µVrms, τ=0.2ms(a)\n(b)\n(c)2.90µVrms, τ=960m s\n00700-018 \nFigure 18. Total RMS Noise  \nTURN -ON TIME  \nMany low power instrument manufacturers are becoming increasingly concerned with the turn -on characteristics of \ncomponents being used in their systems. Fast turn -on compo -\nnents often enable the end user to keep power off when not \nneeded, and yet those components respond quickly when  \nthe power is turned on for operation. Figure 19 displays the \nturn -on characteristic of the AD1580 .  Upon application of power (cold start), the time required for \nthe output voltage to reach its final value within a specified \nerror is the turn -on settling time. Two components normally \nassociated with this are time for active circuits to settle and tim e \nfor thermal gradients on the chip to stabilize. This characteristic \nis generated from cold start operation and represents the true turn -on waveform after power -up. Figure 21 shows both the \ncoarse and fine turn -on settling charac teristics of the device;  \nthe total settling time to within 1.0 mV is about 6 µs, and there \nis no long thermal tail when the horizontal scale is expanded to \n2 ms/div.  \n250m V/DIV 5µs/DIVCL=200pFVIN 0V2.4V\n00700-019 \nFigure 19.

A recommended  \nmethod of driving capacitive loads of this magnitude is shown \nin Figure 20.
