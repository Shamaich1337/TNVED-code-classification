Their outputs are \nguaranteed to pull within 0.52V of either rail without exter -\nnal pullup or pulldown circuitry. Beyond-the-Rails input \nvoltage range and low-voltage, single-supply operation \nmake these devices ideal for portable equipment. These \ncomparators all interface directly to CMOS logic.\nTiming\nMost high-speed comparators oscillate in the linear region \nbecause of noise or undesirable parasitic feedback. This \ncan occur when the voltage on one input is close to or \nequal to the voltage on the other input. These devices \nhave a small amount of internal hysteresis to counter \nparasitic effects and noise.\nThe added hysteresis of the MAX961–MAX964/MAX997/\nMAX999 creates two trip points: one for the rising input \nvoltage and one for the falling input voltage (Figure 1). \nThe difference between the trip points is the hysteresis. \nWhen the comparator’s input voltages are equal, the hys -teresis effectively causes one comparator input voltage to \nmove quickly past the other, thus taking the input out of \nthe region where oscillation occurs. Standard compara -\ntors require hysteresis to be added with external resistors. \nThe fixed internal hysteresis eliminates these resistors.\nThe MAX961/MAX963 include internal latches that allow \nstorage of comparison results. LE has a high input \nimpedance. If LE is low, the latch is transparent (i.e., the \ncomparator operates as though the latch is not present). \nThe comparator’s output state is stored when LE is pulled \nhigh. All timing constraints must be met when using the \nlatch function (Figure 2).\nInput Stage Circuitry\nThe MAX961–MAX964/MAX997/MAX999 include internal \nprotection circuitry that prevents damage to the preci -\nsion input stage from large differential input voltages. \nThis protection circuitry consists of two groups of three \nfront-to-back diodes between IN+ and IN-, as well as two \n200Ω resistors (Figure 3). The diodes limit the differential \nvoltage applied to the comparator’s internal circuitry to no \nmore than 3V F, where V F is the diode’s forward-voltage \ndrop (about 0.7V at +25°C).\nFigure 1.

As long as \nthe differential input voltage is less than 3V F, this input \ncurrent is less than 2I B.\nThe input circuitry allows the MAX961–MAX964/MAX997/\nMAX999’s input common-mode range to extend 100mV \nbeyond both power-supply rails. The output remains in \nthe correct logic state if one or both inputs are within the \ncommon-mode range. Taking either input outside the \ncommon-mode range causes the input to saturate and the \npropagation delay to increase.Figure 2. MAX961/MAX963 Timing Diagram\nFigure 3.

During an \noutput transition, I SOURCE  or ISINK  is pushed or pulled to \nthe output pin. The output source or sink current is high \nduring the transition, creating a rapid slew rate. Once the \noutput voltage reaches V OH or V OL, the source or sink \ncurrent decreases to a small value, capable of maintain -\ning the V OH or V OL in static condition. This decrease in \ncurrent conserves power after an output transition has \noccurred.\nOne consequence of a current-driven output stage is a \nlinear dependence between the slew rate and the load \ncapacitance. A heavy capacitive load slows down the volt -\nage output transition.\nShutdown Mode\nWhen SHDN is high, the MAX961/MAX963/MAX964/\nMAX997 shut down. When shut down, the supply current \ndrops to 270μA per comparator, and the outputs become \nhigh impedance. SHDN has a high input impedance. \nConnect SHDN to GND for normal operation. Exit shut -\ndown with LE low; otherwise, the output is indeterminate.Applications Information\nCircuit Layout and Bypassing\nThe MAX961–MAX964/MAX997/MAX999’s high band -\nwidth requires a high-speed layout. Follow these layout \nguidelines:\n1) Use a PCB with a good, unbroken, low-inductance \nground plane.\n2) Place a decoupling capacitor (a 0.1μF ceramic sur -\nface-mount capacitor is a good choice) as close to \nVCC as possible.\n3) On the inputs and outputs, keep lead lengths short to \navoid unwanted parasitic feedback around the com -\nparators. Keep inputs away from outputs. Keep imped -\nance between the inputs low.\n4) Solder the device directly to the printed circuit board \nrather than using a socket.\n5) Refer to Figure 5 for a recommended circuit layout.\n6) For slow-moving input signals, take care to prevent \nparasitic feedback. A small capacitor (1000pF or less) \nplaced between the inputs can help eliminate oscil -\nlations in the transition region. This capacitor causes \nnegligible degradation to t PD when the source imped -\nance is low.Figure 4. Output Stage Circuitry Figure 5.
