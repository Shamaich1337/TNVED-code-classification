Their operating voltage ranges from +2.5V to +5.5V, making them ideal for both 3V and 5V systems. \nThese comparators also operate with ±1.25V to ±2.75V \ndual supplies. They consume only 48μA per comparator \nwhile achieving a 120ns propagation delay.\nInput bias current is typically 1.0pA, and input offset voltage \nis typically 0.5mV. Internal hysteresis ensures clean output \nswitching, even with slow-moving input signals.\nThe output stage’s unique design limits supply-current \nsurges while switching, virtually eliminating the supply \nglitches typical of many other comparators. The MAX987/\nMAX991/MAX995 have a push-pull output stage that \nsinks as well as sources current. Large internal output \ndrivers allow rail-to-rail output swing with loads up to 8mA. The MAX988/MAX992/MAX996 have an open-drain \noutput stage that can be pulled beyond V\nCC to 6V (max) \nabove V EE. These open-drain versions are ideal for level \ntranslators and bipolar to single-ended converters.\nThe single MAX987/MAX988 are available in tiny 5-pin \nSC70 packages, while the dual MAX991/MAX992 are \navailable in ultra-small μMAX ® package.Benefits and Features\n ●120ns Propagation Delay\n ●48μA Quiescent Supply Current\n ●+2.5V to +5.5V Single-Supply Operation\n ●Common-Mode Input Voltage Range Extends  250mV Beyond the Rails\n ●Push-Pull Output Stage Sinks and Sources \n8mA Current (MAX987/MAX991/MAX995)\n ●Open-Drain Output Voltage Extends Beyond V\nCC \n(MAX988/MAX992/MAX996)\n ●Unique Output Stage Reduces Output Switching  \nCurrent, Minimizing Overall Power Consumption\n ●100μA Supply Current at 1MHz Switching  \nFrequency\n ●No Phase Reversal for Overdriven Inputs\n ●Available in Space-Saving Packages:\n• 5-Pin SC70 (MAX987/MAX988)\n• 8-Pin μMAX (MAX991/MAX992)\nμMAX is a registered trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, \nInc.\n19-1266; Rev 3; 2/17 ●Portable/Battery- \nPowered Systems\n ●Mobile Communications\n ●Zero-Crossing Detectors\n ●Window Comparators\n ●Level Translators ●Threshold Detectors/  \nDiscriminators\n ●Ground/Supply Sensing\n ●IR Receivers\n ●Digital Line ReceiversApplications\nPin Configurations continued at end of data sheet.Ordering Information continued at end of data sheet.\nNote: All devices specified over the -40°C to +85°C operating \ntemperature range.Typical Application Circuit appears at end of data sheet.\nMAX987/MAX988/MAX991/\nMAX992/MAX995/MAX996High-Speed, Micropower, Low-Voltage, \nRail-to-Rail I/O ComparatorsSelector GuideOrdering Information\nPin ConfigurationsPARTCOMPARATORS \nPER PACKAGEOUTPUT \nSTAGE\nMAX987 1 Push-Pull\nMAX988 1 Open-Drain\nMAX991 2 Push-Pull\nMAX992 2 Open-Drain\nMAX995 4 Push-Pull\nMAX996 4 Open-DrainPART PIN-PACKAGEPKG \nCODETOP \nMARK\nMAX987 EXK-T 5 SC70-5 X5-1 ABM\nMAX987ESA 8 SO S8-2 —\nVCC\nIN- IN+1 5VEE OUT\nMAX987\nMAX988\nSC70TOP VIEW\n2\n3 4\nSupply Voltage (V CC to V EE) .................................................. 6V\nIN_-, IN_+ to V EE ..................................... -0.3V to (V CC + 0.3V)\nCurrent into Input Pins ..................................................... ±20mA\nOUT_ to V EE\n MAX987/MAX991/MAX995  .................. -0.3V to (V CC + 0.3V)\n MAX988/MAX992/MAX996  ................................. -0.3V to +6V\nOUT_ Short-Circuit Duration to V EE or V CC ......................... 10s\nContinuous Power Dissipation (T A = +70°C)\n 5-Pin SC70 (derate 3.1mW/°C above +70°C) ............. 247mW 8-Pin SO (derate 5.88mW/°C above +70°C) ............... 471mW\n 8-Pin μMAX (derate 4.5mW/°C above +70°C) ............ 362mW\n 14-Pin TSSOP (derate 9.1mW/°C above +70°C) ........ 727mW\n 14-Pin SO (derate 8.33mW/°C above +70°C) ............. 667mW\nOperating Temperature Range  ........................... -40°C to +85°C\nStorage Temperature Range  ............................ -65°C to +150°C\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s) ................................. +300°C\n(VCC = +2.7V to +5.5V, V EE = 0V, V CM = 0V, T A = -40°C to +85°C, unless otherwise noted.

No Connection. Not internally connected.\nDetailed Description\nThe MAX987/MAX988/MAX991/MAX992/MAX995/  \nMAX996 are single/dual/quad low-power, low-voltage \ncomparators. They have an operating supply voltage \nrange between +2.5V and +5.5V and consume only 48µA per comparator, while achieving 120ns propagation delay. Their common-mode input voltage range extends 0.25V \nbeyond each rail. Internal hysteresis ensures clean output \nswitching, even with slow-moving input signals. Large internal output drivers allow rail-to-rail output swing with \nup to 8mA loads.\nThe output stage employs a unique design that minimizes \nsupply-current surges while switching, virtually eliminating the supply glitches typical of many other comparators.  \nThe MAX987/MAX991/MAX995 have a push-pull  \noutput structure that sinks as well as sources current.  \nThe MAX988/MAX992/MAX996 have an open-drain output \nstage that can be pulled beyond V\nCC to an absolute maximum \nof 6V above V EE.\nInput Stage Circuitry\nThe devices’ input common-mode range extends from  \n-0.25V to (V CC + 0.25V). These comparators may operate at \nany differential input voltage within these limits. Input bias current is typically 1.0pA if the input voltage is between \nthe supply rails. Comparator inputs are protected from overvoltage by internal body diodes connected to the \nsupply rails. As the input voltage exceeds the supply rails, \nthese body diodes become forward biased and begin to \nconduct. Consequently, bias currents increase exponentially \nas the input voltage exceeds the supply rails.\nOutput Stage Circuitry\nThese comparators contain a unique output stage capable of rail-to-rail operation with up to 8mA loads. \nMany comparators consume orders of magnitude more  \ncurrent during switching than during steady-state operation. \nHowever, with this family of comparators, the supply-  \ncurrent change during an output transition is extremely small. The Supply Current vs. Output Transition Frequency \ngraph in the Typical Operating Characteristics  section \nshows the minimal supply-current increase as the output \nswitching frequency approaches 1MHz. This characteristic \neliminates the need for power-supply filter capacitors to \nreduce glitches created by comparator switching currents. Battery life increases substantially in high-speed, battery-powered applications.Applications Information\nAdditional Hysteresis\nMAX987/MAX991/MAX995\nThe MAX987/MAX991/MAX995 have ± 2.5mV internal  \nhysteresis. Additional hysteresis can be generated \nwith three resistors using positive feedback (Figure 1).  \nUnfortunately, this method also slows hysteresis response \ntime. Use the following procedure to calculate resistor  \nvalues for the MAX987/MAX991/MAX995.\n1) Select R3. Leakage current at IN is under 10nA; therefore, \nthe current through R3 should be at least 1µA to minimize errors caused by leakage current. The  \ncurrent through R3 at the trip point is (V\nREF - VOUT) \n/ R3. Considering the two possible output states and solving for R3 yields two formulas: R3 = V\nREF / 1µA or \nR3 = (V REF - VCC) / 1µA. Use the smaller of the two \nresulting resistor values. For example, if  VREF = 1.2V \nand  VCC = 5V, then the two R3 resistor values are \n1.2MΩ and 3.8MΩ . Choose a 1.2MΩ standard value \nfor R3.\n2) Choose the hysteresis band required (V HB). For this \nexample, choose 50mV.\n3) Calculate R1 according to the following equation:\nR1 = R3 x (V HB / VCC)\nFor this example, insert the values R1 = 1.2MΩ  x \n(50mV / 5V) = 12kΩ.\n4) Choose the trip point for V IN rising (V THR; VTHF is \nthe trip point for V IN falling). This is the threshold  \nvoltage at which the comparator switches its output from low to high as V\nIN rises above the trip point. For \nthis example, choose 3V.\nFigure 1.

They have open-drain outputs and require an \nexternal pullup resistor (Figure 2). Additional hysteresis \ncan be generated using positive feedback, but the formulas differ slightly from those of the MAX987/MAX991/MAX995.Use the following procedure to calculate resistor  \nvalues:\n1) Select R3 according to the formulas R3 = V\nREF / 1µA \nor R3 = (V REF - VCC) / 1µA - R4. Use the smaller of \nthe two resulting resistor values.\n2) Choose the hysteresis band required (V HB). For this \nexample, choose 50mV.\n3) Calculate R1 according to the following equation:\nR1 = (R3 + R4) x (V HB / VCC)\n4) Choose the trip point for V IN rising (V THR; VTHF is the \ntrip point for V IN falling). This is the threshold voltage \nat which the comparator switches its output from low \nto high as V IN rises above the trip point.\n5) Calculate R2 as follows:\nTHR\nREF1R2 = \nV 11    V  x R1 R1 R3  R4\uf8eb\uf8f6−− \uf8ec\uf8f7+ \uf8ed\uf8f8\n6) Verify trip voltages and hysteresis as follows:\nIN THR REF\nCCIN THF THR\nTHR THFV  rising: V  = V  x R1  x\n11 1                      R1 R2 R3  R4\nR1 x  VV  falling : V  V   R3  R4\nHysteresis  V   V\uf8eb\uf8f6++\uf8ec\uf8f7+ \uf8ed\uf8f8\n\uf8eb\uf8f6= − \uf8ec\uf8f7+\uf8ed\uf8f8\n= −\nCircuit Layout and Bypassing\nThese comparators’ high-gain bandwidth requires design \nprecautions to maximize their high-speed capability. The \nrecommended precautions are:\n1) Use a PCB with an unbroken, low-inductance ground \nplane.\n2) Place a decoupling capacitor (a 0.1µF ceramic capacitor is a good choice) as close to V\nCC as \npossible.\n3) On the inputs and outputs, keep lead lengths short to avoid unwanted parasitic feedback around the  \ncomparators.\n4) Solder the devices directly to the PCB instead of  \nusing a socket.Figure 2.
