R 10/205\nTOP242-250\nwww.power.com TOPSwitch-GX Family Functional \nDescription\nLike TOPSwitch, TOPSwitch-GX is an integrated switched \nmode power supply chip that converts a current at the control input to a duty cycle at the open drain output of a high voltage power MOSFET.  During normal operation the duty cycle of the power MOSFET decreases linearly with increasing CONTROL pin current as shown in Figure 7. \nIn addition to the three terminal TOPSwitch features, such as \nthe high voltage start-up, the cycle-by-cycle current limiting, \nloop compensation circuitry, auto-restart, thermal shutdown, \nthe TOPSwitch-GX incorporates many additional functions that \nreduce system cost, increase power supply performance and \ndesign flexibility.  A patented high voltage CMOS technology \nallows both the high voltage power MOSFET and all the low \nvoltage control circuitry to be cost effectively integrated onto a \nsingle monolithic chip. \nThree terminals, FREQUENCY, LINE-SENSE, and EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT (available in Y, R or F package) or one terminal MULTI-FUNCTION (available in P or G package) have been added to implement some of the new functions.  These terminals can be connected to the SOURCE pin \nto operate the TOPSwitch-GX in a TOPSwitch-like three \nterminal mode. However, even in this three terminal mode, \nthe TOPSwitch-GX offers many new transparent features \nthat do not require any external components: \n1.\n A fully integrated 10 ms soft-start limits peak curr\nents \nand voltages during start-up and dramatically reduces \nor eliminates output overshoot in most applications. \n2. \n DCMAX of 78% allows smaller input storage capacitor, \nlower input voltage requirement and/or higher power capability.\n3. \n Fr\nequency reduction at light loads lowers the switching \nlosses and maintains good cross regulation in multiple output supplies. \n4. \n Higher switching fr\nequency of 132 kHz reduces the \ntransformer size with no noticeable impact on EMI. \n5. \n Fr\nequency jittering reduces EMI. \n6. \n Hyster\netic over-temperature shutdown ensures \nautomatic recovery from thermal fault. Large hysteresis prevents circuit board overheating. \n7. \n Packages with omitted pins and lead forming pr\novide \nlarge drain creepage distance. \n8. \n T\nighter absolute tolerances and smaller temperature  \nvariations on switching frequency, current limit and PWM gain.\n \nThe LINE-SENSE (L) pin is usually used for line sensing by \nconnecting a resistor from this pin to the rectified DC high  voltage bus to implement line overvoltage (OV), under-voltage (UV) and line feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction.  In \nthis mode, the value of the resistor determines the OV/UV thresholds and the DC\nMAX is reduced linearly starting from a line voltage above the undervoltage threshold. See Table 2 \nand Figure 11.\nThe pin can also be used as a remote ON/OFF and a  \nsynchronization input.\nThe EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT (X) pin is usually used to \nreduce the current limit externally to a value close to the operating peak current, by connecting the pin to SOURCE through a resistor.  This pin can also be used as a remote  ON/OFF and a synchronization input in both modes. See  Table 2 and Figure 11. \nFor the P or G packages the LINE-SENSE and EXTERNAL \nCURRENT LIMIT pin functions are combined on one MULTI-FUNCTION (M) pin. However, some of the functions become mutually exclusive as shown in Table 3.\nThe FREQUENCY (F) pin in the Y, R or F package sets the \nswitching frequency to the default value of 132 kHz when  connected to SOURCE pin.

Leaving this pin open is not recommended. \nCONTROL (C) Pin Operation\nThe CONTROL pin is a low impedance node that is capable of receiving a combined supply and feedback current. During normal operation, a shunt regulator is used to separate the feedback signal from the supply current.  CONTROL pin voltage V\nC is the supply voltage for the control circuitry \nincluding the MOSFET gate driver.  An external bypass capacitor closely connected between the CONTROL and SOURCE pins is required to supply the instantaneous gate drive current.  The total amount of capacitance connected to this pin also sets the auto-restart timing as well as control loop compensation. \nWhen rectified DC high voltage is applied to the DRAIN pin \nduring start-up, the MOSFET is initially off, and the CONTROL pin capacitor is charged through a switched high voltage current source connected internally between the DRAIN and CONTROL pins. When the CONTROL pin voltage V\nC reaches approximately 5.8 V, the control circuitry is \nactivated and the soft-start begins.  The soft-start circuit gradually increases the duty cycle of the MOSFET from zero to the maximum value over approximately 10 ms. If no external feedback/supply current is fed into the CONTROL pin by the end of the soft-start, the high voltage current source is turned off and the CONTROL pin will start discharging in response to the supply current drawn by the control circuitry.  If the power supply is designed properly, and no fault condition such as open loop or shorted output exists, the feedback loop will close, providing external CONTROL pin current, before the CONTROL pin voltage has had a chance to discharge to the lower threshold voltage of approximately 4.8 V (internal supply undervoltage lockout threshold). When the externally fed current charges the CONTROL pin to the shunt regulator voltage of 5.8 V, current in excess of the consumption of the chip is shunted to SOURCE through resistor R\nE as \nshown in Figure 2.  This current flowing through RE controls \nthe duty cycle of the power MOSFET to provide closed loop regulation.  The shunt regulator has a finite low output impedance Z\nC that sets the gain of the error amplifier when \nused in a primary feedback configuration.  The dynamic impedance Z\nC of the CONTROL pin together with the \nexternal CONTROL pin capacitance sets the dominant pole for the control loop.\nWhen a fault condition such as an open loop or shorted \noutput prevents the flow of an external current into the CONTROL pin, the capacitor on the CONTROL pin discharges towards 4.8 V. At 4.8 V, auto-restart is activated which turns the output MOSFET off and puts the control circuitry in a low current standby mode. The high-voltage current source turns on and charges the external capacitance again.  A hysteretic internal supply undervoltage comparator keeps V\nC within a window \nof typically 4.8 V to 5.8 V by turning the high-voltage current source on and off as shown in Figure 8.  The auto-restart circuit has a divide-by-eight counter which prevents the output MOSFET from turning on again until eight discharge/charge cycles have elapsed.  This is accomplished by enabling the output MOSFET only when the divide-by-eight counter reaches full count (S7). The counter effectively limits TOPSwitch-GX power dissipation by reducing the auto-restart duty cycle to typically 4%. \nPI-2545-082299S1 S2 S6 S7 S1 S2 S6 S7 S0 S1 S7S0 S05.8 V\n4.8 VS70 V\n0 V\n0 VVLINE\nVC\nVDRAIN\nVOUT\nNote: S0 through S7 are the output states of the auto-restart counter  2 1 2 3 40 V\n~~~~ ~~ ~~ ~~\nS6 S7~~ ~~ ~~ ~~VUV\n~~\n~~ ~~ ~~S2~~\nFigure 8. Typical Waveforms for (1) Power Up (2) Normal Operation (3) Auto-Restart (4) Power Down.\nRev. R 10/207\nTOP242-250\nwww.power.com Auto-restart mode continues until output voltage regulation \nis again achieved through closure of the feedback loop.\nOscillator and Switching Frequency\nThe internal oscillator linearly charges and discharges an  internal capacitance between two voltage levels to create a sawtooth waveform for the pulse width modulator.  This oscillator sets the pulse width modulator/current limit latch at the beginning of each cycle. \nThe nominal switching frequency of 132 kHz was chosen to \nminimize transformer size while keeping the fundamental EMI frequency below 150 kHz.  The FREQUENCY pin (available only in Y, R or F package), when shorted to the CONTROL pin, lowers the switching frequency to 66 kHz (half frequency) which may be preferable in some cases such as noise sensitive video applications or a high efficiency standby mode.  Otherwise, the FREQUENCY pin should be connected to the SOURCE pin for the default 132 kHz. \nTo further reduce the EMI level, the switching frequency \nis jittered (frequency modulated) by approximately ±4 kHz at 250 Hz (typical) rate as shown in Figure 9.  Figure 46 shows the typical improvement of EMI measurements with frequency jitter.\nPulse Width Modulator and Maximum Duty Cycle\nThe pulse width modulator implements voltage mode control by driving the output MOSFET with a duty cycle inversely proportional to the current into the CONTROL pin\n \nthat is in excess of the internal supply current of the chip (see Figure 7).  The excess current is the feedback error signal that appears across R\nE (see Figure 2).  This signal is \nfiltered by an RC network with a typical corner frequency of 7 kHz to reduce the effect of switching noise in the chip supply current generated by the MOSFET gate driver.  The filtered error signal is compared with the internal oscillator sawtooth waveform to generate the duty cycle waveform.  As the control current increases, the duty cycle decreases.  A clock signal from the oscillator sets a latch which turns on the output MOSFET.  The pulse width modulator resets the latch, turning off the output MOSFET.  Note that a minimum current must be driven into the CONTROL pin before the duty cycle begins to change. \nThe maximum duty cycle, DC\nMAX, is set at a default \nmaximum value of 78% (typical).  However, by connecting \nthe LINE-SENSE or MULTI-FUNCTION pin (depending on the package) to the rectified DC high voltage bus through a resistor with appropriate value, the maximum duty cycle can be made to decrease from 78% to 38% (typical) as shown in Figure 11 when input line voltage increases (see line feed forward with DC\nMAX reduction).\nLight Load Frequency ReductionThe pulse width modulator duty cycle reduces as the load at the power supply output decreases.  This reduction in duty cycle is proportional to the current flowing into the CONTROL pin.  As the CONTROL pin current increases, the duty cycle decreases linearly towards a duty cycle of 10%. Below 10% duty cycle, to maintain high efficiency at light loads, the frequency is also reduced linearly until a minimum frequency is reached at a duty cycle of 0% (refer to Figure 7).  The minimum frequency is typically 30 kHz and 15 kHz for 132 kHz and 66 kHz operation, respectively.\nThis feature allows a power supply to operate at lower  \nfrequency at light loads thus lowering the switching losses while maintaining good cross regulation performance and low output ripple.  \nError Amplifier\nThe shunt regulator can also perform the function of an error amplifier in primary side feedback applications.  The shunt regulator voltage is accurately derived from a temperature-compensated bandgap reference.  The gain of the error amplifier is set by the CONTROL pin dynamic impedance. The CONTROL pin clamps external circuit signals to the V\nC voltage level. The CONTROL pin current \nin excess of the supply current is separated by the shunt regulator and flows through R\nE as a voltage error signal. \nOn-Chip Current Limit with External ProgrammabilityThe cycle-by-cycle peak drain current limit circuit uses the output MOSFET ON-resistance as a sense resistor.  A current limit comparator compares the output MOSFET on-state drain to source voltage, V\nDS(ON) with a threshold \nvoltage.  High drain current causes VDS(ON) to exceed the \nthreshold voltage and turns the output MOSFET off until the start of the next clock cycle.  The current limit comparator threshold voltage is temperature compensated to minimize the variation of the current limit due to temperature related changes in  R\nDS(ON) of the output MOSFET. The default \ncurrent limit of TOPSwitch-GX is preset internally.  However, with a resistor connected between EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT (X) pin (Y, R or F package) or MULTI-FUNCTION (M) pin (P or G package) and SOURCE pin, current limit can be programmed externally to a lower level between 30% \nPI-2550-092499\n128 kHz\n4 ms\nTimeSwitching\nFrequency\nVDRAIN  136 kHz\nFigure 9. Switching Frequency Jitter (Idealized VDRAIN   \n Waveforms).\nRev. R 10/208\nTOP242-250\nwww.power.com and 100% of the default current limit.  Please refer to the \ngraphs in the typical performance characteristics section for the selection of the resistor value. By setting current limit low, a larger TOPSwitch-GX than necessary for the power required can be used to take advantage of the lower R\nDS(ON) \nfor higher efficiency/smaller heat sinking requirements. With a second resistor connected between the EXTERNAL  CURRENT LIMIT (X) pin (Y, R or F package) or MULTI-FUNCTION (M) pin (P or G package) and the rectified DC high voltage bus, the current limit is reduced with increasing line voltage, allowing a true power limiting operation against line variation to be implemented.  When using an RCD clamp, this power limiting technique reduces maximum clamp voltage at high line. This allows for higher reflected voltage designs as well as reducing clamp dissipation. \nThe leading edge blanking circuit inhibits the current limit  \ncomparator for a short time after the output MOSFET is turned on.  The leading edge blanking time has been set so that, if a power supply is designed properly, current spikes caused by primary-side capacitances and secondary-side rectifier reverse recovery time should not cause premature termination of the switching pulse.\nThe current limit is lower for a short period after the leading \nedge blanking time as shown in Figure 52.  This is due to dynamic characteristics of the MOSFET.  To avoid triggering the current limit in normal operation, the drain current waveform should stay within the envelope shown.\nLine Undervoltage Detection (UV)\nAt power up, UV keeps TOPSwitch-GX off until the input line voltage reaches the undervoltage threshold.  At power down, UV prevents auto-restart attempts after the output goes out of regulation.  This eliminates power down glitches caused by slow discharge of the large input storage capacitor present in applications such as standby supplies. A single resistor connected from the LINE-SENSE pin (Y, R or F package) or MULTI-FUNCTION pin (P or G package) to the rectified DC high voltage bus sets UV threshold during power up.  Once the power supply is successfully turned on, the UV threshold is lowered to 40% of the initial UV threshold to allow extended input voltage operating range (UV low threshold).  If the UV low threshold is reached during operation without the power supply losing regulation, the device will turn off and stay off until UV (high threshold) has been reached again.  If the power supply loses regulation before reaching the UV low threshold, the device will enter auto-restart. At the end of each auto-restart cycle (S7), the UV comparator is enabled. If the UV high threshold is not exceeded the MOSFET will be disabled during the next cycle (see Figure 8). The UV feature can be disabled independent of the OV feature as shown in Figures 19 and 23.\nLine Overvoltage Shutdown (OV)\nThe same resistor used for UV also sets an overvoltage threshold which, once exceeded, will force TOPSwitch-GX output into off-state.  The ratio of OV and UV thresholds is preset at 4.5 as can be seen in Figure 11.  When the MOSFET is off, the rectified DC high voltage surge capability is increased to the voltage rating of the MOSFET (700 V), due to the absence of the reflected voltage and leakage spikes on the drain.  A small amount of hysteresis is provided on the OV threshold to prevent noise triggering. The OV feature can be disabled independent of the UV feature as shown in Figures 18 and 32.\nLine Feed-Forward with DC\nMAX Reduction\nThe same resistor used for UV and OV also implements \nline voltage feed-forward, which minimizes output line ripple and reduces power supply output sensitivity to line \nPI-2637-060600 Oscillator\n(SAW)\nDMAX\nEnable from\nX, L or M Pin (STOP)\nTime\nFigure 10. Synchronization Timing Diagram.\nRev. R 10/209\nTOP242-250\nwww.power.com transients.  This feed-forward operation is illustrated in \nFigure 7 by the different values of IL (Y, R or F package) or \nIM (P or G package).  Note that for the same CONTROL \npin current, higher line voltage results in smaller operating \nduty cycle.  As an added feature, the maximum duty cycle DC\nMAX is also reduced from 78% (typical) at a voltage \nslightly higher than the UV threshold to 30% (typical) at the OV threshold (see Figure 11). Limiting DC\nMAX at higher \nline voltages helps prevent transformer saturation due to large load transients in TOP248, TOP249 and TOP250 forward converter applications. DC\nMAX of 38% at high \nline was chosen to ensure that the power capability of the TOPSwitch-GX is not restricted by this feature under normal operation.\nRemote ON/OFF and Synchronization\nTOPSwitch-GX can be turned on or off by controlling \nthe current into the LINE-SENSE pin or out from the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin (Y, R or F package) and into or out from the MULTI-FUNCTION pin (P or G package) (see Figure 11).  In addition, the LINE-SENSE pin has a 1 V threshold comparator connected at its input.  This voltage threshold can also be used to perform remote ON/OFF control. This allows easy implementation of remote  ON/OFF control of TOPSwitch-GX in several different ways.  A transistor or an optocoupler output connected between the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT or LINE-SENSE pins (Y, R or F package) or the MULTI-FUNCTION pin (P or G package) and the SOURCE pin implements this function with “active-on” (Figures 22, 29 and 36) while a transistor or an optocoupler output connected between the LINE-SENSE pin (Y, R or F package) or the MULTI-FUNCTION  (P or G package) pin and the CONTROL pin implements the function with “active-off” (Figures 23 and 37). \nWhen a signal is received at the LINE-SENSE pin or the  \nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin (Y, R or F package) or the MULTI-FUNCTION pin (P or G package) to disable the output through any of the pin functions such as OV, UV \nand remote ON/OFF, TOPSwitch-GX always completes its \ncurrent switching cycle, as illustrated in Figure 10, before the output is forced off. The internal oscillator is stopped slightly before the end of the current cycle and stays there as long as the disable signal exists.  When the signal at the above pins changes state from disable to enable, the internal oscillator starts the next switching cycle. This approach allows the use of these pins to synchronize TOPSwitch-GX to any external signal with a frequency between its internal switching frequency and 20 kHz.\nAs seen above, the remote ON/OFF feature allows the \nTOPSwitch-GX to be turned on and off instantly, on a cycle-\nby-cycle basis, with very little delay.  However, remote  ON/OFF can also be used as a standby or power switch to \nturn off the TOPSwitch-GX and keep it in a very low power  \nconsumption state for indefinitely long periods.  If the \nTOPSwitch-GX is held in remote off state for long enough time to allow the CONTROL pin to discharge to the internal  \nsupply undervoltage threshold of 4.8 V (approximately 32 ms for a 47 µF CONTROL pin capacitance), the CONTROL \npin goes into the hysteretic mode of regulation.  In this mode, the CONTROL pin goes through alternate charge \nand discharge cycles between 4.8 V and 5.8 V (see CONTROL pin operation section above) and runs entirely off the high voltage DC input, but with very low power consumption (160 mW typical at 230 VAC with M or X \npins open).  When the TOPSwitch-GX is remotely turned \non after entering this mode, it will initiate a normal start-up sequence with soft-start the next time the CONTROL pin reaches 5.8 V. In the worst case, the delay from remote on to start-up can be equal to the full discharge/charge cycle time of the CONTROL pin, which is approximately 125 ms for a 47 µF CONTROL pin capacitor. This reduced consumption remote off mode can eliminate expensive and unreliable in-line mechanical switches. It also allows for microprocessor controlled turn-on and turn-off sequences that may be required in certain applications such as inkjet and laser printers.  \nSoft-Start\nTwo on-chip soft-start functions are activated at start-up with a duration of 10 ms (typical).  Maximum duty cycle starts from 0% and linearly increases to the default maximum of 78% at the end of the 10 ms duration and the current limit starts from about 85% and linearly increases to 100% at the end of the 10 ms duration.  In addition to start-up, soft-start is also activated at each restart attempt during auto-restart and when restarting after being in hysteretic regulation of CONTROL pin voltage (V\nC), due to remote OFF \nor thermal shutdown conditions.  This effectively minimizes current and voltage stresses on the output MOSFET, the clamp circuit and the output rectifier during start-up.  This feature also helps minimize output overshoot and prevents saturation of the transformer during start-up.\nShutdown/Auto-Restart\nTo minimize TOPSwitch-GX power dissipation under fault \nconditions, the shutdown/auto-restart circuit turns the power supply on and off at an auto-restart duty cycle of typically 4% if an out of regulation condition persists.  Loss of regulation interrupts the external current into the CONTROL pin. V\nC regulation changes from shunt mode to \nthe hysteretic auto-restart mode as described in CONTROL pin operation section.  When the fault condition is removed, the power supply output becomes regulated, V\nC regulation \nreturns to shunt mode, and normal operation of the power supply resumes.\nHysteretic Over-Temperature Protection\nTemperature protection is provided by a precision analog  circuit that turns the output MOSFET off when the junction temperature exceeds the thermal shutdown temperature  (140 °C typical).  When the junction temperature cools to  below the hysteretic temperature, normal operation \nRev. R 10/2010\nTOP242-250\nwww.power.com Table 2. Typical LINE-SENSE and EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT Pin Configurations.resumes providing automatic recovery. A large hysteresis of \n70 °C (typical) is provided to prevent overheating of the PC board due to a continuous fault condition. V\nC is regulated \nin hysteretic mode and a 4.8 V to 5.8 V (typical) sawtooth \nwaveform is present on the CONTROL pin while in thermal shutdown. \nBandgap Reference\nAll critical TOPSwitch-GX internal voltages are derived from a temperature-compensated bandgap reference.  This reference  is also used to generate a temperature-compensated current reference, which is trimmed to accurately set the switching frequency, MOSFET gate drive current, current limit, and the line OV/UV thresholds.  TOPSwitch-GX has improved circuitry to maintain all of the above critical parameters within very tight absolute and temperature tolerances.\nHigh-Voltage Bias Current Source\nThis current source biases TOPSwitch-GX from the DRAIN pin and charges the CONTROL pin external capacitance  during start-up or hysteretic operation.  Hysteretic operation occurs during auto-restart, remote OFF and over-temp-erature shutdown.  In this mode of operation, the current source is switched on and off with an effective duty cycle of approximately 35%.  This duty cycle is determined by the ratio of CONTROL pin charge (I\nC) and discharge currents \n(ICD1 and ICD2).  This current source is turned off during normal \noperation when the output MOSFET is switching. The effect of the current source switching will be seen on the DRAIN voltage waveform as small disturbances and is normal.\nUsing Feature Pins\nFREQUENCY (F) Pin OperationThe FREQUENCY pin is a digital input pin available in the   Y, R or F package only. Shorting the FREQUENCY pin to SOURCE pin selects the nominal switching frequency of  132 kHz (Figure 13), which is suited for most applications.  For other cases that may benefit from lower switching  frequency such as noise sensitive video applications, a  66 kHz switching frequency (half frequency) can be selected by shorting the FREQUENCY pin to the CONTROL pin (Figure 14).  In addition, an example circuit shown in Figure 15 may be used to lower the switching frequency from 132 kHz in normal operation to 66 kHz in standby mode for very low standby power consumption.\nLINE-SENSE (L) Pin Operation (Y, R  and F Packages)\nWhen current is fed into the LINE-SENSE pin, it works as a voltage source of approximately 2.6 V up to a maximum  current of +400 µA (typical).  At +400 µA, this pin turns into a constant current sink. Refer to Figure 12a.  In addition, a comparator with a threshold of 1 V is connected at the pin and is used to detect when the pin is shorted to the SOURCE pin.\nThere are a total of four functions available through the \nuse of the LINE-SENSE pin: OV, UV, line feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction, and remote ON/OFF.  Connecting \nthe LINE-SENSE pin to the SOURCE pin disables all four functions.  The LINE-SENSE pin is typically used for line sensing by connecting a resistor from this pin to the rectified DC high voltage bus to implement OV, UV and DC\nMAX reduction with line voltage. In this mode, the value \nof the resistor determines the line OV/UV thresholds, and the DC\nMAX is reduced linearly with rectified DC high voltage \nstarting from just above the UV threshold.  The pin can also be used as a remote ON/OFF and a synchronization input.  Refer to Table 2 for possible combinations of the functions with example circuits shown in Figure 16 through Figure 40.  A description of specific functions in terms of the LINE-SENSE pin I/V characteristic is shown in Figure 11 (right hand side). The horizontal axis represents LINE-SENSE pin current with positive polarity indicating currents \nLINE-SENSE AND EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT PIN TABLE*\n       Figure Number 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29\nThree Terminal Operation 3\nUndervoltage 3 3 3 3 3\nOvervoltage 3 3 3 3 3\nLine Feed-Forward (DCMAX) 3 3 3 3\nOverload Power Limiting 3\nExternal Current Limit 3 3 3 3 3 3\nRemote ON/OFF 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n*This table is only a partial list of many LINE-SENSE and EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin configurations that are possible.\nt\nRev.

Line feed-forward \nwith DCMAX reduction lowers maximum duty cycle from 78% \nat IL(DC) (+60 µA typical) to 38% at IOV (+225 µA).  \nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT (X) Pin Operation  (Y, R and F Packages)When current is drawn out of the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin, it works as a voltage source of approximately  1.3 V up to a maximum current of -240 µA (typical). At  -240 µA, it turns into a constant current source (refer to  Figure 12a).\nThere are two functions available through the use of the  \nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin: external current limit  and remote ON/OFF. Connecting the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin to the SOURCE pin disables the two functions. In high efficiency applications, this pin can be used to reduce the current limit externally to a value close to the operating peak current by connecting the pin to the SOURCE pin through a resistor. The pin can also be used for remote ON/OFF. Table 2 shows several possible combinations using this pin. See Figure 11 for a description of the functions where the horizontal axis (left hand side) represents the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin current.  The meaning of the vertical axes varies with function. For those that control the ON/OFF states of the output such as remote ON/OFF, the vertical axis represents the enable/disable states of the output.  For external current limit, the vertical axis represents the magnitude of the I\nLIMIT.  Please \nsee graphs in the Typical Performance Characteristics section for the current limit programming range and the selection of appropriate resistor value.\nMULTI-FUNCTION (M) Pin Operation  \n(P and G Packages)The LINE-SENSE and EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin functions are combined to a single MULTI-FUNCTION pin for P and G packages.  The comparator with a 1 V threshold at the LINE-SENSE pin is removed in this case as shown in Figure 2b. All of the other functions are kept intact.  However, since some of the functions require opposite polarity of input current (MULTI-FUNCTION pin), they are mutually exclusive. For example, line sensing  features cannot be used simultaneously with external current limit setting.  When current is fed into the MULTI- FUNCTION pin, it works as a voltage source of approximately 2.6 V up to a maximum current of +400 µA (typical).  At +400 µA, this pin turns into a constant current sink.  When current is drawn out of the MULTI-FUNCTION pin, it works as a voltage source of approximately 1.3 V up to a maximum current of -240 µA (typical).  At -240 µA, it turns into a constant current source.  Refer to Figure 12b.\nThere are a total of five functions available through the use \nof the MULTI-FUNCTION pin: OV, UV, line feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction, external current limit and remote \nON/OFF.  A short circuit between the MULTI-FUNCTION pin and SOURCE pin disables all five functions and forces  TOPSwitch-GX to operate in a simple three terminal mode like TOPSwitch-II.  The MULTI-FUNCTION pin is typically used for line sensing by connecting a resistor from this pin to the rectified DC high voltage bus to implement OV, UV and DC\nMAX reduction with line voltage.  In this mode, the \nvalue of the resistor determines the line OV/UV thresholds, and the DC\nMAX is reduced linearly with increasing rectified \nDC high voltage starting from just above the UV threshold.  External current limit programming is implemented by connecting the MULTI-FUNCTION pin to the SOURCE pin \nTable 3.

However, this function is not necessary \nin most applications since the internal current limit of the P and G package devices has been reduced, compared to the Y, R and F package devices, to match the thermal dissipation capability of the P and G packages. It is there- fore recommended that the MULTI-FUNCTION pin is used for line sensing as described above and not for external current limit reduction. The same pin can also be used as a remote ON/OFF and a synchronization input in both modes.  Please refer to Table 3 for possible combinations of the functions with example circuits shown in Figure 30 through Figure 40.  A description of specific functions in terms of the MULTI-FUNCTION pin I/V characteristic is shown in Figure 11.  The horizontal axis represents MULTI-FUNCTION pin current with positive polarity indicating currents flowing into the pin. The meaning of the vertical axes varies with functions.

A nominal efficiency of 80% at full load is achieved using TOP244Y. \nThe current limit is externally set by resistors R1 and R2 \nto a value just above the low line operating peak DRAIN current of approximately 70% of the default current limit.  This allows use of a smaller transformer core size and/or higher transformer primary inductance for a given output power, reducing TOPSwitch-GX power dissipation, while at the same time avoiding transformer core saturation during start-up and output transient conditions.  The resistors R1 & R2 provide a signal that reduces the current limit with increasing line voltage, which in turn limits the maximum overload power at high input line voltage.  This function in combination with the built-in soft-start feature of TOPSwitch-GX, allows the use of a low cost RCD clamp (R3, C3 and D1) with a higher reflected voltage, by safely limiting the TOPSwitch-GX drain voltage, with adequate margin under worst case conditions. Resistor R4  provides line sensing, setting UV at 100 VDC and OV at  450 VDC. The extended maximum duty cycle feature of TOPSwitch-GX (guaranteed minimum value of 75% vs. 64% for TOPSwitch-II) allows the use of a smaller input capacitor (C1). The extended maximum duty cycle and the higher reflected voltage possible with the RCD clamp also permit the use of a higher primary to secondary turns ratio for T1, which reduces the peak reverse voltage experienced by the secondary rectifier D8.  As a result a 60 V Schottky rectifier can be used for up to 15 V outputs, which greatly improves power supply efficiency. The frequency reduction feature of the TOPSwitch-GX eliminates the need for any dummy loading for regulation at no load and reduces the no-load/standby consumption of the power supply. Frequency jitter provides improved margin for conducted EMI, meeting the CISPR 22 (FCC B) specification.\nOutput regulation is achieved by using a simple Zener \nsense circuit for low cost.  The output voltage is determined \nby the Zener diode (VR2) voltage and the voltage drops across the optocoupler (U2) LED and resistor R6. Resistor R8 provides bias current to Zener VR2 for typical regulation of ±5% at the 12 V output level, over line and load and component variations. \nRev. R 10/2021\nTOP242-250\nwww.power.com A High Efficiency, Enclosed, 70 W, Universal  \nAdapter SupplyThe circuit shown in Figure 42 takes advantage of several of the TOPSwitch-GX features to reduce cost, power supply size and increase efficiency.  This design delivers 70 W at 19 V, from an 85 VAC to 265 VAC input, at an ambient of 40 °C, in a small sealed adapter case (4”x2.15”x1”). Full load efficiency is 85% at 85 VAC rising to 90% at 230 VAC input.\nDue to the thermal environment of a sealed adapter, a \nTOP249Y is used to minimize device dissipation.  Resistors R9 and R10 externally program the current limit level to just above the operating peak DRAIN current at full load and low line.  This allows the use of a smaller transformer core size without saturation during start-up or output  load transients.  Resistors R9 and R10 also reduce the current limit with increasing line voltage,  limiting the maximum overload power at high input line voltage, removing the need for any protection circuitry on the secondary.  Resistor R11 implements an undervoltage and overvoltage sense as well as providing line feed-forward for reduced output line frequency ripple.  With resistor R11 set at 2 MΩ, the power supply does not start operating until the DC rail voltage reaches 100 VDC.  On removal of the AC input, the UV sense prevents the output glitching as C1 discharges,  turning off the TOPSwitch-GX when the output regulation is lost or when the input voltage falls to below 40 V, whichever  occurs first.  This same value of R11 sets the OV threshold to 450 V. If exceeded, for example during a line surge,  TOPSwitch-GX stops switching for the duration of the surge, extending the high voltage withstand to 700 V without device damage. Capacitor C11 has been added in parallel with VR1 to reduce Zener clamp dissipation. With a switching frequency of 132 kHz, a PQ26/20 core can be used to provide 70 W. To maximize efficiency, by reducing winding losses, two output windings are used each with their own dual 100 V Schottky rectifier (D2 and D3). The frequency reduction feature of the TOPSwitch-GX eliminates any dummy loading to maintain regulation at no load and reduces the no-load consumption of the power supply to only 520 mW at 230 VAC input. Frequency jittering provides conducted EMI meeting the CISPR 22 (FCC B) / EN55022B specification, using simple filter components (C7, L2, L3 and C6), even with the output earth grounded.\nTo regulate the output, an optocoupler (U2) is used with a  \nsecondary reference sensing the output voltage via a resistor divider (U3, R4, R5, R6).  Diode D4 and C15 filter and smooth the output of the bias winding. Capacitor C15 (1 µF) prevents the bias voltage from falling during zero to full load transients.  Resistor R8 provides filtering of leakage inductance spikes, keeping the bias voltage constant even at high output loads.   \n19 V \n@ 3.6 A\nTOP249Y\nU1\nU3\nTL431U2\nPC817A\nDL\nSX FCRTN\nL2\n820 H\n2A\nC6\n0.1 F\nX2\nF13.15 A85-265 VACBR1\nRS805\n8A 600 V\nL375 \nH\n2AtT1C13\n0.33 F\n400 VC12\n0.022 F\n400 VC11\n0.01 F\n400 V\nRT1\n10 \n1.7 A\nPI-2691-042203All resistors 1/8 W 5% unless otherwise stated.J1\nL\n \nNCONTROLCONTROLTOPSwitch-GXC1\n150 F\n400 VPERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nOutput Power:           70 W\nRegulation:            4%\nEfficiency:            84%\nRipple:            120 mV pk-pk\nNo Load Consumption:       0.52 W @ 230 VAC\nC5\n47 F\n16 VC3\n820 F\n25 VL1\n200 H\nC2\n820 F\n25 VC14\n0.1 F\n50 V\nC4\n820 F\n25 V\nC10\n0.1 F\n50 VC9\n4.7 nF 50 V\nC8\n0.1 F\n50 VVR1P6KE-200D2MBR20100C7  2.2 nF\nY1 Safety\nD3MBR20100\nD41N4148 R11\n2 M\n1/2 W\nR9\n13 MR8\n4.7 R1\n270 \nR2\n1 k R5\n562 \n1%R4\n31.6 k\n1%\nR7\n56 k\nR10\n20.5 kR3\n6.8 \nR6\n4.75 k\n1%C15\n1 F\n50 VD1UF4006\nFigure 42. 70 W Power Supply using Current Limit Reduction with Line and Line Sensing for UV and OV.\nRev. R 10/2022\nTOP242-250\nwww.power.com Resistor R7, C9 and C10 together with C5 and R3 provide \nloop compensation.\nDue to the large primary currents, all the small signal control \ncomponents are connected to a separate source node that is Kelvin connected to the SOURCE pin of the TOPSwitch-GX. For improved common-mode surge immunity, the bias winding common returns directly to the DC bulk capacitor (C1).\nA High Efficiency, 250 W, 250-380 VDC Input  \nPower Supply\nThe circuit shown in Figure 43 delivers 250 W (48 V @  5.2 A) at 84% efficiency using a TOP249 from a 250 VDC to 380 VDC input.  DC input is shown, as typically at this power level a p.f.c. boost stage would preceed this supply, providing the DC input (C1 is included to provide local decoupling).  Flyback topology is still usable at this power level due to the high output voltage, keeping the secondary peak currents low enough so that the output diode and capacitors are reasonably sized.\nIn this example, the TOP249 is at the upper limit of its \npower capability and the current limit is set to the internal maximum by connecting the X pin to SOURCE.  However, line sensing is implemented by connecting a 2 MΩ resistor from the L pin to the DC rail.  If the DC input rail rises above 450 VDC, then TOPSwitch-GX will stop switching until the voltage returns to normal, preventing device damage.\nDue to the high primary current, a low leakage inductance  \ntransformer is essential.  Therefore, a sandwich winding with a copper foil secondary was used.  Even with this technique, the leakage inductance energy is beyond the power capability of a simple Zener clamp.  Therefore, R2, R3 and C6 are added in parallel to VR1.  These have been sized such that during normal operation, very little power is dissipated by VR1, the leakage energy instead being dissipated by R2 and R3.  However, VR1 is essential to limit the peak drain voltage during start-up and/or overload conditions to below the 700 V rating of the TOPSwitch-GX MOSFET.\nThe secondary is rectifed and smoothed by D2 and C9, \nC10 and C11.  Three capacitors are used to meet the secondary ripple current requirement.  Inductor L2 and C12 provide switching noise filtering.\nA simple Zener sensing chain regulates the output voltage.  \nThe sum of the voltage drop of VR2, VR3 and VR4 plus the LED drop of U2 gives the desired output voltage. Resistor R6 limits LED current and sets overall control loop DC gain.   Diode D4 and C14 provide secondary soft-finish, feeding  current into the CONTROL pin prior to output regulation \n48 V@\n5.2 A+250-380\nVDC\n0 VL D\nSX FCRTN\nPI-2692-081204All resistor 1/8 W 5% unless \notherwise stated.CONTROLTOPSwitch-GXC1\n22 µF\n400 V\nC3\n0.1 µF\n50 VR4\n6.8 ΩR6\n100 Ω\nR8\n56 ΩR9\n10 kΩ\nC3\n47 µF\n10 VC6\n4.7 nF\n1 kV\nC13\n150 nF\n63 VC4\n1 µF\n50 V\nC14\n22 µF\n63 VC9\n560 µF\n63 VC10\n560 µF\n63 VC11\n560 µF\n63 V\nC12\n68 µF\n63 VC7\n2.2 nF Y1\nL2\n3 µH 8AD2\nMUR1640CT\nD21N4148 U2\nLTV817AD1\nBYV26C\nT1R1\n2 MΩ\n1/2 WR3\n68 kΩ\n2 WR2\n68 kΩ\n2 WVR1\nP6KE200\nVR2 22 V\nBZX79B22\nVR3 12 V\nBZX79B12\nVR4 12 V\nBZX79B12CONTROLD41N4148 PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nOutput Power:      250 W\nLine Regulation:       ± 1%Load Regulation:      ± 5%Efficiency:            ≥ 85%Ripple:        < 100 mV pk-pk\nNo Load Consumption:     ≤ 1.4 W (300 VDC)TOP249Y\nU1\nFigure 43. 250 W, 48 V Power Supply using TOP249.\nRev.

Capacitor C13 and R8 provide control loop compensation and are required due to the gain associated with such a high output voltage.\nSufficient heat sinking is required to keep the TOPSwitch-GX \ndevice below 110 °C when operating under full load, low line and maximum ambient temperature.  Airflow may also be required if a large heat sink area is not acceptable.\nMultiple Output, 60 W, 185-265 VAC Input  \nPower SupplyFigure 44 shows a multiple output supply typical for high end set-top boxes or cable decoders containing high capacity hard disks for recording. The supply delivers an output power of 45 W continuous/60 W peak (thermally limited) from an input voltage of 185 VAC to 265 VAC.  Efficiency at 45 W, 185 VAC is ≥ 75%.\nThe 3.3 V and 5 V outputs are regulated to ±5% without \nthe need for secondary linear regulators. DC stacking (the  secondary winding reference for the other output voltages is connected to the cathode of D10 rather than the anode) is used to minimize the voltage error for the higher voltage outputs.  Due to the high ambient operating temperature requirement typical of a set-top box (60 °C), the TOP246Y is used to  reduce conduction losses and minimize heat sink size.   Resistor R2 sets the device current limit to 80% of typical to limit overload power.  The line sense resistor (R1) protects the TOPSwitch-GX from line surges and transients by sensing when the DC rail voltage rises to above 450 V. In this condition the TOPSwitch-GX stops switching, extending the input voltage withstand to 496 VAC, which is ideal for countries with poor power quality. A thermistor (RT1) is used to prevent premature failure of the fuse by limiting the inrush current (due to the relatively large size of C2). An optional MOV (RV1) extends the differential surge protection to 6 kV from 4 kV.\nLeakage inductance clamping is provided by VR1, R5 \nand C5, keeping the DRAIN voltage below 700 V under all conditions.  Resistor R5 and capacitor C5 are selected such that VR1 dissipates very little power except during overload conditions.  The frequency jittering feature of TOPSwitch-GX allows the circuit shown to meet CISPR22B with simple EMI filtering (C1, L1 and C6) and the output grounded.\nThe secondaries are rectified and smoothed by D7 to D11, \nC7, C9, C11, C13, C14, C16 and C17.  Diode D11 for the 3.3 V output is a Schottky diode to maximize efficiency.  \nFigure 44. 60 W Multiple Output Power Supply using TOP246.D6\n1N4148D7\nUF4003\nD8\nUF5402\nD9\nUF5402\nD11MBR1045D10BYV32-200\nT1 U2\nLTV817\nU3TL431C20\n22 µF\n10 VR7\n150 Ω\nR12\n10 kC19\n0.1 µFR11\n9.53 \nkΩR10\n15.0 \nkΩ\nR9\n3.3 kΩR8\n1 kΩC6\n2.2 nF\nY1C7\n47 µF\n50 V\nC9\n330 µF\n25 V\nC11\n390 µF\n35 V\nC14 \n1000 µF\n25 V30 V @      0.03 A\n18 V @      0.5 A\n12 V @ \n     0.6 A\n5 V @ \n     3.2 A\n3.3 V @ \n     3 A\nRTND1-D4\n1N4007 V\nF1\n3.15 ARV1\n275 V\n14 mm\nJ1L1\n20 mH\n0.8A\nt°L\n \nNR3\n6.8 Ω\nC5\n47 µF\n10 VTOP246Y\nU1DL\nSCTOPSwitch-GXR1\n2 MΩ\n1/2 WR5\n68 kΩ\n2 WR6\n10 Ω\nRT1\n10 Ω\n1.7 AC2\n68 µF\n400 VC5\n1 nF\n400 V\nC3\n1 µF\n50 V\nC1\n0.1 µF\nX1\nPI-2693-081704CONTROLCONTROL\nC3\n0.1 µF\n50 V XFD61N4937VR1\nP6KE170C16 \n1000 µF\n25 VC13 \n1000 µF\n25 V\nC17 \n1000 µF\n25 VC15 \n220 µF\n16 V\nC18 \n220 µF\n16 VC12 \n100 µF\n25 VC10 \n100 µF\n25 VC8 \n10 µF\n50 VL2 \n3.3 µH\n3A\nL3 \n3.3 µH\n3A\nL4 \n3.3 µH\n5A\nL5 \n3.3 µH\n5APERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nOutput Power:       45 W Cont./60 W Peak\nRegulation:      3.3 V:        ± 5%\n     5 V:           ± 5%\n     12 V:         ± 7%\n     18 V:         ± 7%\n     30 V:         ± 8%\nEfficiency:   ≥75%\nNo Load Consumption: 0.6 W185-265 VA CR2\n9.08 kΩ\nRev.

The 3.3 V and 5 V output require two capacitors in parallel to meet the ripple current requirement.  Switching noise filtering is provided by L2 to L5 and C8, C10, C12, C15 and C18.  Resistor R6 prevents peak charging of the lightly loaded 30 V output.  The outputs are regulated using a secondary reference (U3).  Both the 3.3 V and 5 V outputs are sensed via R11 and R10.  Resistor R8 provides bias for U3 and R7 sets the overall DC gain. Resistor R9, C19, R3 and C5 provide loop compensation. A soft-finish capacitor (C20) eliminates output overshoot.\nProcessor Controlled Supply Turn On/Off\nA low cost momentary contact switch can be used to turn the TOPSwitch-GX power on and off under microprocessor control, which may be required in some applications such as printers.  The low power remote OFF feature allows an elegant implementation of this function with very few external components, as shown in Figure 45.  Whenever the push button momentary contact switch P1 is closed by the user, the optocoupler U3 is activated to inform the microprocessor of this action.  Initially, when the power supply is off (M pin is floating), closing of P1 turns the power supply on by shorting the M pin of the TOPSwitch-GX to  \nSOURCE through a diode (remote ON).  When the secondary output voltage V\nCC is established, the micro-\nprocessor comes alive and recognizes that the switch P1 is closed through the switch status input that is driven by the optocoupler U3 output.  The microprocessor then sends a power supply control signal to hold the power supply in the on-state through the optocoupler U4.  If the user presses the switch P1 again to command a turn off, the microprocessor detects this through the optocoupler U3 and initiates a shutdown procedure that is product specific.  For example, in the case of the inkjet printer, the shutdown procedure may include safely parking the print heads in the storage position.  In the case of products with a disk drive, the shutdown procedure may include saving data or settings to the disk.  After the shutdown procedure is complete, when it is safe to turn off the power supply, the microprocessor releases the M pin by turning the optocoupler U4 off. If the manual switch and the optocouplers U3 and U4 are not located close to the M pin, a capacitor C\nM may be needed to prevent noise coupling to \nthe pin when it is open.\nU1U2\nU4\nU3\nCM\nP1 P1 Switch \nStatusPower\nSupply\nON/OFF\nControlExternal\nWake-up\nSignal\nPI-2561-030805VCC\n(+5 V)\nRETURNCONTROLMICRO-\nPROCESSOR/ \nCONTROLLER\nLOGIC\nINPUTLOGIC\nOUTPUTHigh-Voltage\nDC Input\nTOPSwitch-GX D M\nS FC1N4148\nU4\nLTV817A6.8 kΩ\n1 nF100 kΩ\n6.8 kΩ\nU3\nLTV817A27 kΩ\n1N4148\n47 µF+\nFigure 45.

R 10/2025\nTOP242-250\nwww.power.com The power supply could also be turned on remotely \nthrough a local area network or a parallel or serial port by driving the optocoupler U4 input LED with a logic signal.  Sometimes it is easier to send a train of logic pulses through a cable (due to AC coupling of cable, for example) instead of a DC logic level as a wake up signal.  In this case, a simple RC filter can be used to generate a DC level to drive U4 (not shown in Figure 45).  This remote on feature can be used to wake up peripherals such as printers, scanners, external modems, disk drives, etc., as needed from a computer.  Peripherals are usually designed to turn off automatically if they are not being used for a period of time, to save power.\nIn addition to using a minimum number of components, \nTOPSwitch-GX provides many technical advantages in this type of application:\n1.\n Extr\nemely low power consumption in the off mode:  \n80 mW typical at 110 VAC and 160 mW typical at  \n230 VAC.  This is because, in the remote OFF mode, the TOPSwitch-GX consumes very little power and the external circuitry does not consume any current (either M, L or X pin is open) from the high voltage DC input.\n2.\n A very low cost, low voltage/curr\nent, momentary \ncontact switch can be used.3.  No debouncing cir cuitry for the momentary switch \nis required. During turn-on, the start-up time of the power supply (typically 10 ms to 20 ms) plus the microprocessor initiation time act as a debouncing filter, allowing a turn-on only if the switch is depressed firmly for at least the above delay time. During turn-off, the microprocessor initiates the shutdown sequence when it detects the first closure of the switch and subsequent bouncing of the switch has no effect.  If necessary, the microprocessor could implement the switch debouncing in software during turn-off, or a filter capacitor can be used at the switch status input.\n4.\n No exter\nnal current limiting circuitry is needed for the \noperation of the U4 optocoupler output due to internal limiting of M pin current.\n5.\n No high voltage r\nesistors to the input DC voltage rail are \nrequired to power the external circuitry in the primary.  Even the LED current for U3 can be derived from the CONTROL pin.  This not only saves components and simplifies layout, but also eliminates the power loss associated with the high voltage resistors in both ON and OFF states.\n6.\n Robust design: Ther\ne is no ON/OFF latch that can be \naccidentally triggered by transients. Instead, the power supply is held in the ON-state through the secondary-side microprocessor. \nRev.

Many of \nthe new features eliminate the need for additional discrete components. Other features increase the robustness of design, allowing cost savings in the transformer and other power components.\nTOPSwitch-GX Design Considerations Power Table\nData sheet power table (Table 1) represents the maximum practical continuous output power based on the following conditions: TOP242 to TOP246: 12 V output, Schottky output diode, 150 V reflected voltage (V\nOR) and efficiency \nestimates from curves contained in application note  AN-29. TOP247 to TOP250: Higher output voltages, with a maximum output current of 6 A.\nFor all devices, a 100 VDC minimum for 85-265 VAC and  \n250 VDC minimum for 230 VAC are assumed and sufficient heat sinking to keep device temperature ≤100 °C. Power  levels shown in the power table for the R package device  assume 6.45 cm\n2 of 610 g/m2 copper heat sink area in an  \nenclosed adapter, or 19.4 cm2 in an open frame.  \nTOPSwitch-GX SelectionSelecting the optimum TOPSwitch-GX depends upon required maximum output power, efficiency, heat sinking constraints and cost goals. With the option to externally reduce current limit, a larger TOPSwitch-GX may be used for lower power applications where higher efficiency is needed or minimal heat sinking is available.Table 5. Comparison Between TOPSwitch-FX and TOPSwitch-GX. *Not available   \nRev. R 10/2029\nTOP242-250\nwww.power.com Input Capacitor\nThe input capacitor must be chosen to provide the minimum  DC voltage required for the TOPSwitch-GX converter to maintain regulation at the lowest specified input voltage and maximum output power.  Since TOPSwitch-GX has a higher DC\nMAX than TOPSwitch-II, it is possible to use a \nsmaller input capacitor.  For TOPSwitch-GX, a capacitance of 2 µF per watt is possible for universal input with an appropriately designed transformer.\nPrimary Clamp and Output Reflected Voltage V\nOR\nA primary clamp is necessary to limit the peak  \nTOPSwitch-GX drain to source voltage.  A Zener clamp requires few parts and takes up little board space.  For good efficiency, the clamp Zener should be selected to be at least 1.5 times the output reflected voltage V\nOR, as this \nkeeps the leakage spike conduction time short.  When using a Zener clamp in a universal input application, a V\nOR of less than 135 V is recommended to allow for the \nabsolute tolerances and temperature variations of the Zener.  This will ensure efficient operation of the clamp circuit and will also keep the maximum drain voltage below the rated breakdown voltage of the TOPSwitch-GX MOSFET.\nA high V\nOR is required to take full advantage of the wider \nDCMAX of TOPSwitch-GX. An RCD clamp provides tighter \nclamp voltage tolerance than a Zener clamp and allows \na VOR as high as 150 V.  RCD clamp dissipation can be \nminimized by reducing the external current limit as a function of input line voltage (see Figures 21 and 35).  The RCD clamp is more cost effective than the Zener clamp but requires more careful design (see Quick Design Checklist). \nOutput Diode\nThe output diode is selected for peak inverse voltage, output  \ncurrent, and thermal conditions in the application (including heat sinking, air circulation, etc.). The higher DC\nMAX of \nTOPSwitch-GX, along with an appropriate transformer turns \nratio, can allow the use of a 60 V Schottky diode for higher efficiency on output voltages as high as 15 V (see Figure 41:  A 12 V, 30 W design using a 60 V Schottky for the output diode).\nBias Winding Capacitor\nDue to the low frequency operation at no-load a 1 µF bias  winding capacitor is recommended.\nSoft-Start\nGenerally, a power supply experiences maximum stress at  start-up before the feedback loop achieves regulation. For a period of 10 ms, the on-chip soft-start linearly increases the duty cycle from zero to the default DC\nMAX at turn on. \nIn addition, the primary current limit increases from 85% to 100% over the same period.  This causes the output voltage to rise in an orderly manner, allowing time for the feedback loop to take control of the duty cycle.  This reduces the stress on the TOPSwitch-GX MOSFET, clamp circuit and output diode(s), and helps prevent transformer saturation during start-up.  Also, soft-start limits the amount of output voltage overshoot and, in many applications, eliminates the need for a soft-finish capacitor.\nEMI \nThe frequency jitter feature modulates the switching frequency over a narrow band as a means to reduce conducted EMI peaks associated with the harmonics of the fundamental switching frequency.  This is particularly beneficial for average detection mode.  As can be seen in Figure 46, the benefits of jitter increase with the order of the switching harmonic due to an increase in frequency deviation.\n-20-100-1020304050607080\n0.15 1 10 30\nFrequency (MHz)Amplitude (dBµV)\nPI-2576-010600\nEN55022B (QP)\nEN55022B (AV)\nEN55022B (QP)EN55022B (AV)\n-20-100-1020304050607080\n0.15 1 10 30\nFrequency (MHz)Amplitude (dBµV)\nPI-2577-010600TOPSwitch-HX (with jitter)Figure 46a.

TOPSwitch-GX Full Range EMI Scan (132 kHz, with \n  \n   \n     Jitter) with Identical Circuitr\ny and Conditions.  \nRev. R 10/2030\nTOP242-250\nwww.power.com The FREQUENCY pin of TOPSwitch-GX offers a \nswitching frequency option of 132 kHz or 66 kHz.  In applications that require heavy snubbers on the drain node for reducing high frequency radiated noise (for example, video noise sensitive applications such as VCR, DVD, monitor, TV, etc.), operating at 66 kHz will reduce snubber loss resulting in better efficiency.  Also, in applications where transformer size is not a concern, use of the 66 kHz option will provide lower EMI and higher  efficiency.  Note that the second harmonic of 66 kHz is still below 150 kHz, above which the conducted EMI specifications get much tighter. \nFor 10 W or below, it is possible to use a simple inductor \nin place of a more costly AC input common mode choke to meet worldwide conducted EMI limits.\nTransformer Design\nIt is recommended that the transformer be designed for  maximum operating flux density of 3000 Gauss and a peak flux density of 4200 Gauss at maximum current limit.  The turns ratio should be chosen for a reflected voltage (V\nOR) no greater than 135 V when using a Zener \nclamp, or 150 V (max) when using an RCD clamp with current limit reduction with line voltage (overload protection).\nFor designs where operating current is significantly lower \nthan the default current limit, it is recommended to use an externally set current limit close to the operating peak current to reduce peak flux density and peak power (see Figures 20 and 34). In most applications, the tighter current limit tolerance, higher switching frequency and soft-start features of TOPSwitch-GX contribute to a smaller transformer when compared to TOPSwitch-II . \nStandby ConsumptionFrequency reduction can significantly reduce power loss at light or no load, especially when a Zener clamp is used.  For very low secondary power consumption, use a TL431 regulator for feedback control. Alternately, switching losses can be significantly reduced by changing from 132 kHz in normal operation to 66 kHz under light load conditions.\nTOPSwitch-GX Layout ConsiderationsAs TOPSwitch-GX has additional pins and operates \nat much higher power levels compared to previous TOPSwitch families, the following guidelines should be carefully followed.\nPrimary Side Connections\nUse a single point (Kelvin) connection at the negative terminal of the input filter capacitor for the TOPSwitch-GX SOURCE pin and bias winding return. This improves surge capabilities by returning surge currents from the bias winding directly to the input filter capacitor.\nThe CONTROL pin bypass capacitor should be located \nas close as possible to the SOURCE and CONTROL pins and its SOURCE connection trace should not be shared by the main MOSFET switching currents. All SOURCE pin referenced components connected to the MULTI-FUNCTION, LINE-SENSE or EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pins should also be located closely between their respective pin and SOURCE.  Once again, the SOURCE connection trace of these components should not be shared by the main MOSFET switching currents. It is very critical that SOURCE pin switching currents are returned to the input capacitor negative terminal through a seperate trace that is not shared by the components connected to CONTROL, MULTI-FUNCTION, LINE-SENSE or EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pins.  This is because the SOURCE pin is also the controller ground  reference pin.  \nAny traces to the M, L or X pins should be kept as short \nas possible and away from the DRAIN trace to prevent noise coupling. LINE-SENSE resistor (R1 in Figures 47-49) should be located close to the M or L pin to minimize the trace length on the M or L pin side.\nIn addition to the 47 µF CONTROL pin capacitor, a high  \nfrequency bypass capacitor in parallel may be used for better noise immunity.  The feedback optocoupler output should also be located close to the CONTROL and SOURCE pins of TOPSwitch-GX.\nY-Capacitor\nThe Y-capacitor should be connected close to the secondary output return pin(s) and the positive primary DC input pin of the transformer.\nHeat Sinking\nThe tab of the Y package (TO-220) or F package  (TO-262) is internally electrically tied to the SOURCE pin. To avoid circulating currents, a heat sink attached to the tab should not be electrically tied to any primary ground/source nodes on the PC board.\nWhen using a P (DIP-8), G (SMD-8) or R (TO-263) \npackage, a copper area underneath the package connected to the SOURCE pins will act as an effective heat sink. On double sided boards (Figure 49), top side and bottom side areas connected with vias can be used to increase the effective heat sinking area.  \nIn addition, sufficient copper area should be provided at \nthe anode and cathode leads of the output diode(s) for heat sinking.\nRev.

This trace acts as a thermal relief between the rectifier and filter capacitor to prevent excessive heating of the capacitor. \nQuick Design ChecklistAs with any power supply design, all TOPSwitch-GX \ndesigns should be verified on the bench to make sure that components specifications are not exceeded under worst case conditions. The following minimum set of tests is strongly recommended:\n1.\n Maximum drain voltage – V\nerify that peak VDS does not \nexceed 675 V at highest input voltage and maximum \noverload output power. Maximum overload output power occurs when the output is overloaded to a level just before the power supply goes into auto-restart (loss of regulation).\n2.\n Maximum drain curr\nent – At maximum ambient \ntemperature, maximum input voltage and maximum output load, verify drain current waveforms at start-up for any signs of transformer saturation and excessive leading edge current spikes.  TOPSwitch-GX has a leading edge blanking time of 220 ns to prevent premature termination of the ON-cycle.Verify that the leading edge current spike is below the allowed current limit envelope (see Figure 52) for the drain current waveform at the end of the 220 ns blanking period.\n3.\n Thermal check – At maximum output power\n, minimum  \ninput voltage and maximum ambient temperature, verify that temperature specifications are not exceeded for TOPSwitch-GX, transformer, output diodes and output capacitors.  Enough thermal margin should be allowed \nfor the part-to-part variation of the R\nDS(ON)  of TOPSwitch-\nGX, as specified in the data sheet.  The margin required \ncan either be calculated from the tolerances or it can be accounted for by connecting an external resistance in series with the DRAIN pin and attached to the same heat sink, having a resistance value that is equal to the \ndifference between the measured R\nDS(ON) of the device \nunder test and the worst-case maximum specification.\nDesign Tools\nFor a discussion on utilizing TOP248, TOP249 \nand TOP250 in forward converter configurations, please refer to the TOPSwitch-GX Forward Design Methodology Application Note.\nUp-to-date information on design tools can be found at the \nPower Integrations website: www.power.com-HV\n+ -DC\nOut\nPI-2734-043001T\nr\na\nn\ns\nf\no\nr\nm\ne\nrSafety Spacing\nY1-\nCapacitorSolder Side\nComponent Side\nOpto-\ncoupler+Output Filter Capacitors\nMaximize hatched copper \nareas (           ) for optimum heat sinkingTOP VIEW\nInput Filter \nCapacitor\nR1a - 1cPRI\nPRISEC\nBIAS\nTOPSwitch-GXS\nL\nCXD\nFigure 49.

Current Limit vs. X or M Pin Current (see Figures 55a and 56a for TOP245P/G and TOP246P/G).The following precautions should be followed when \ntesting TOPSwitch-GX by itself outside of a power supply. The schematic shown in Figure 53 is suggested for laboratory testing of TOPSwitch-GX.\nWhen the DRAIN pin supply is turned on, the part will \nbe in the auto-restart mode. The CONTROL pin voltage will be oscillating at a low frequency between 4.8 V and 5.8 V and the drain is turned on every eigth cycle of the CONTROL pin oscillation. If the CONTROL pin power supply is turned on while in this auto-restart mode, there is only a 12.5% chance that the CONTROL pin oscillation will be in the correct state (drain active state) so that the continuous drain voltage waveform may be observed. It is recommended that the V\nC power supply be turned \non first and the DRAIN pin power supply second if continuous drain voltage waveforms are to be observed. The 12.5% chance of being in the correct state is due to the divide-by-8 counter. Temporarily shorting the CONTROL pin to the SOURCE pin will reset TOPSwitch-GX, which then will come up in the correct state.BENCH TEST PRECAUTIONS FOR EVALUATION OF ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nTypical Performance Characteristics\n0.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.01.1\n60\n4080100120140160180200\n-250 -200 -150 -100 -50\nIX or IM (µA)Current Limit (A)\ndi/dt (mA/µs)PI-2653-033015\n0Scaling Factors:\nTOP242 P/G/Y/R/F:   .45TOP243 P/G:            .75TOP243 Y/R/F:         .90TOP244 P/G: 1TOP244 Y/R/F:       1.35TOP245 Y/R/F:       1.80TOP246 Y/R/F:       2.70TOP247 Y/R/F:       3.60TOP248 Y/R/F        4.50TOP249 Y/R/F:       5.40TOP250 Y/R/F:       6.32\n0.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.01.1\n60\n4080100120140160180200\n05 K 10K 15K 20K 25K 30K 35K 40K\nExternal Current Limit Resistor RIL (Ω)Current Limit (A)\ndi/dt (mA/ µs)PI-2652-042303\n45KMaximum and minimum levels \nare based on characterization.
