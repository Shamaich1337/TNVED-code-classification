The MIC3808/9 are ideal for telecomlevel (36V to 75V) isolated step down dc/dc conversionapplications where high output current, small size, and highefficiency are required.\nThe dual-ended push-pull architecture of the MIC3808/9\nallows more efficient utilization of the transformer than single-ended topologies, allowing smaller size dc/dc solutions.Additionally, the out-of-phase push-pull topology allows ahigher effective duty cycle, reducing input and output rippleas well as stress on the external components. The dead-timebetween the two outputs is adjustable between 60ns to200ns, limiting the duty cycle of each output stage to less than50%.\nThe MIC3808/9 are built on a low-power, high-speed BiCMOS\nprocess. The 130 µA start-up current and 1mA run-current\nreduce the size of the start-up circuitry and allow highefficiency even at light loads.  The high-speed internal 4MHzerror amplifier allows MIC3808/9 operation up to 1MHz.\nThe MIC3808 has a turn-on threshold of 12.5V whereas the\nMIC3809 has a lower turn-on threshold of 4.3V. Both devicesare available in SOP-8 and MSOP-8 package options with anoperating range of –40 °C to +85 °C.\nData sheets and support documentation can be found on\nMicrel’s web site at:  www.micrel.com.Features\n• Dual output drive stages in push-pull configuration• Leading edge current-sense blanking• 130 µA typical start-up current\n• 1mA typical run current• Operation to 1MHz• Internal soft start• On-chip error amplifier with 4MHz gain bandwidth\nproduct\n• On-chip V\nDD clamping\n• Output drive stages capable of 500mA peak source\ncurrent, 1A peak sink current\nApplications\n• High efficiency “brick” power supply modules\n• Half bridge converters• Full bridge converters• Push-pull converters• Voltage-fed push-pull converters\n• Telecom equipment and power supplies• Networking power supplies• Industrial power supplies• 42V automotive power supplies• Base stations\nMicrel, Inc. • 2180 Fortune Drive • San Jose, CA 95131 • USA • tel + 1 (408) 944-0800 • fax + 1 (408) 474-1000 • http://www.mic rel.comTypical Application\nVIN\n36V to 75V\nMIC3808VOUT\n12V 100W\nRC\nGNDVDD\nOUTA\nFBCOMP OUTB\nCSStart-Up\nCircuitry\nSlope\nComp\nReference\n& Isolation\nMIC3808/3809 Micrel\nMIC3808/3809 2 April 2005Pin Configuration\n1 COMP\nFB\nCS\nRC8 VDD\nOUTAOUTBGND7\n652\n34\nSOIC-8 (M)\nMSOP-8 (MM)\nPin Description\nPin Number Pin Name Pin Function\n1 COMP COMP is the output of the error amplifier and the input of the PWM com-\nparator. The error amplifier in the MIC3808 is a true low-output impedance,4MHz operational amplifier. As such, the COMP pin can both source and\nsink current. However, the error amplifier is internally current limited, so that\nzero duty cycle can be externally forced by pulling COMP to GND. TheMIC3808 family features built-in full cycle soft start.  Soft start is imple-\nmented as a clamp on the maximum COMP voltage.\n2 FB The inverting input to the error amplifier. For best stability, keep FB lead\nlength as short as possible and FB stray capacitance as small as possible.\n3 CS The input to the PWM, peak current, and overcurrent comparators. The\novercurrent comparator is only intended for fault sensing. Exceeding theovercurrent threshold will cause a soft start cycle. An internal MOSFET\ndischarges the current sense filter capacitor to improve dynamic perfor-\nmance of the power converter.\n4 RC The oscillator programming pin. The MIC3808’s oscillator tracks VDD and\nGND internally, so that variations in power supply rails minimally affect\nfrequency stability. Only two components are required to program theoscillator, a resistor (tied to the V\nDD and RC), and a capacitor (tied to the RC\nand GND). The approximate oscillator frequency is determined by the simple\nformula: F1.41\nRCOSCILLATOR=\nwhere frequency is in Hertz, resistance in Ohms, and capacitance in Farads.\nThe recommended range of timing resistors is between 7k Ω and 200k Ω and\nrange of timing capacitors is between 100pF and 1000pF. Timing resistors\nless than 7k Ω should be avoided. For best performance, keep the timing\ncapacitor lead to GND as short as possible, the timing resistor lead from VDD\nas short as possible, and the leads between timing components and RC asshort as possible. Separate ground and V\nDD traces to the external timing\nnetwork are encouraged.Ordering Information\nPart Number\nTurn On Turn Off\nStandard Lead-Free Threshold Threshold Temperature Range Package\nMIC3808BM MIC3808YM 12.5V 8.3V –40 °C to +85 °C 8-Pin SOIC\nMIC3809BM MIC3809YM 4.3V 4.1V –40 °C to +85 °C 8-Pin SOIC\nMIC3808BMM MIC3808YMM 12.5V 8.3V –40 °C to +85 °C 8-Pin MSOP\nMIC3809BMM MIC3809YMM 4.3V 4.1V –40 °C to +85 °C 8-Pin MSOP\nApril 2005 3 MIC3808/3809MIC3808/3809 Micrel\nPin Description\nPin Number Pin Name Pin Function\n5 GND Ground\n6 OUTB Alternating high current output stages. Both stages are capable of driving the\ngate of a power MOSFET. Each stage is capable of 500mA peak source\n7 OUTA current, and 1A peak sink current. The output stages switch at half the\noscillator frequency, in a push/pull configuration. When the voltage on theRC pin is rising, one of the two outputs is high, but during fall time, both\noutputs are off. This “dead time” between the two outputs, along with a\nslower output rise time than fall time, insures that the two outputs can not beon at the same time. This dead time is typically 60ns to 200ns and depends\nupon the values of the timing capacitor and resistor. The high-current output\ndrivers consist of MOSFET output devices, which switch from V\nDD to GND.\nEach output stage also provides a very low impedance to overshoot and\nundershoot. This means that in many cases, external Schottky clamp diodes\nare not required.\n8 VDD The power input connection for this device. Although quiescent VDD current\nis very low, total supply current will be higher, depending on OUTA and\nOUTB current, and the programmed oscillator frequency. Total VDD current\nis the sum of quiescent VDD current and the average OUT current. Knowing\nthe operating frequency and the MOSFET gate charge (Qg), average OUT\ncurrent can be calculated from IOUT = Qg × F, where F is frequency. To\nprevent noise problems, bypass VDD to GND with a ceramic capacitor as\nclose to the chip as possible. A 1 µF decoupling capacitor is recommended.\nMIC3808/3809 Micrel\nMIC3808/3809 4 April 2005Electrical Characteristics\nTA = TJ = –40 °C to +85 °C, VDD = 10V ( Note 9 ), 1µF capacitor from VDD to GND, R = 22K Ω, C = 330pF.\nParameter Condition Min Typ Max Units\nOscillator Section\nOscillator Frequency 180 200 220 kHz\nOscillator Amplitude/VDD Note 4 0.44 0.5 0.56 V/V\nError Amp Section\nInput Voltage COMP = 2V 1.95 2 2.05 V\nInput Bias Current –1 1 µA\nOpen Loop Voltage Gain (Guaranteed by design) 60 80 dB\nCOMP Sink Current FB = 2.2V, COMP = 1V 0.3 2.5 mA\nCOMP Source Current FB = 1.3V, COMP = 3V, Note 5 –0.15 –0.5 mA\nCOMP Clamp Voltage VFB = 0V 3.1 3.6 4.0 V\nPWM Section\nMaximum Duty Cycle Measured at OUTA or OUTB 48 49 50 %\nMinimum Duty Cycle COMP = 0V 0%\nCurrent Sense Section\nGain Note 6 (Guaranteed by design) 1.9 2.2 2.5 V/V\nMaximum Input Signal Note 7 0.45 0.5 0.55 V\nCS to Output Delay COMP = 3V, CS from 0 to 600mV 70 200 ns\nCS Source Current –200 nA\nCS Sink Current CS = 0.5V, RC = 5.5V,  Note 8 51 0 m A\nOver Current Threshold 0.7 0.75 0.8 V\nCOMP to CS Offset CS = 0V 0.35 0.8 1.2 V\nOutput Section\nOUT Low Level I = 100mA 0.5 1 V\nOUT High Level I = –50mA, VDD - OUT 0.5 1 V\nRise Time CL = 1nF 25 60 ns\nFall Time CL = 1nF 25 60 nsAbsolute Maximum Ratings (Note 1)\nSupply Voltage (IDD ≤ 10mA) ......................................+15V\nSupply Current ........................................................... 20mA\nOUTA/OUTB Source Current (peak).......................... –0.5AOUTA/OUTB Sink Current (peak) ................................ 1.0A\nComp Pin ......................................................................V\nDD\nAnalog Inputs (FB, CS) ........................–0.3V to VDD +0.3V\nNOT TO EXCEED 6V\nJunction Temperature .............................. –55 °C to +150 °C\nStorage Temperature ............................... –65 °C to +150 °C\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10 sec.) ................... +300 °C\nESD Rating, Note 3 ...................................................... 2kVOperating Ratings (Note 2)\nVDD Input Voltage (VDD) ........................................

MIC3808 has a higher VDD\nturn-on threshold and more hysteresis between VDD turn-on\nand turn-off than the MIC3809. The outputs of the controlleroperate in a push-pull fashion with a guaranteed dead timebetween them.  A block diagram of the MIC3808/9 controlleris shown in Figure 1.\nV\nDD and Turn-on Sequence\nThe oscillator and output gate drive signals are disabled\nwhen VDD is lower than the turn on threshold. Circuitry in the\noutput drivers eliminates glitching or random pulsing duringthe start-up sequence. The oscillator is enabled when V\nDD is\napplied and reaches the turn-on threshold. The VDD com-\nparator also turns off the internal soft-start discharge FET,slowly bringing up the COMP pin voltage.\nThe V\nDD pin is internally clamped. As VDD approaches this\nclamp voltage, the VDD current will increase over the normal\ncurrent draw of the IC. Exceeding the VDD zener shunt\nvoltage may cause excessive power dissipation in theMIC3808/9.\nSoft-StartThe soft start feature helps reduce surge currents at the\npower supply input source.  An internal current source andcapacitor ramp up from 0V to near Vdd at a typical rate of1V/ms. The softstart feature limits the output voltage of theFunctional Diagram\nTQ\n/QQS\nRQS1\nS2\nRQS\nROscillator VDD OK\nVDDVDD —1VPeak Current\nComparatorOvercurrent\nComparator\nPWM\nComparatorPWM\nLatch\nSlope = 1V/msSoft Start2.2V2.0V\n0.5V\nR0.8V14VVDD\nOUTA\nOUTB678\n5GND0.5V\n1.2R0.75V3.65V\nError\nAmplifier\nRC4FB\n2COMP\n1CS\n3\nVoltage\nReference\nFigure 1.

The internalsoftstart voltage is discharged and remains discharged dur-ing the following conditions:\n1. The V\nDD voltage drops below the turn-off\nthreshold\n2. The voltage on the CS pin exceeds the\novercurrent comparator threshold\nOnce the internal softstart discharge FET is turned on, it\ncannot be turned off until the internal softstart voltage dropsdown below 0.5V. This insures a clean restart.\nOscillatorThe oscillator operates at twice the switching frequency of\neither OUTA or OUTB. The oscillator generates a sawtoothwaveform on the RC pin. The rising edge of the waveform iscontrolled by the external resistor/capacitor combination.The fall time is set by the on-resistance of the discharge FET(see Figure 2). The fall time sets the delay (dead time)between the turn-off of one output driver and the turn-on of theother driver. A toggle flip-flop insures that drive signals toOUTA and OUTB are alternated and therefore insures amaximum duty cycle of less than 50% for each output driver.Graphs of component values vs. oscillator frequency anddead time are shown in the typical characteristic section ofthis specification.\nApril 2005 9 MIC3808/3809MIC3808/3809 Micrel\nQS\nR\n0.2VVDD\n2VDD\nOSCILLATOR\nOUTPUTRC4\nFigure 2. Oscillator\nThe voltage source to the resistor/capacitor timing compo-\nnents is VDD. The internal turn-off comparator threshold in the\noscillator circuit is VDD/2. This allows the oscillator to track\nchanges in VDD and minimize frequency variations in the\noscillator. The oscillator frequency can be roughly approxi-mated using the following formula:\nF_oscillator = 1.41/R*C\nWhere: frequency is in Hz\nResistance is in OhmsCapacitance is in Farads.\nGraphs of oscillator frequency and dead time vs component\nvalues are shown in the Typical Characteristic section of thisspecification. The recommended range of timing resistorsand capacitors is 10k Ω to 200kΩ and 100pF to 1000pF. To\nminimize oscillator noise and insure a stable waveform thefollowing layout rules should be followed:\n1. The higher impedance of capacitor values less\nthan 100pF may causes the oscillator circuit tobecome more susceptible to noise. Parasitic pinand etch trace capacitances become a largerpart of the total RC capacitance and mayinfluence the desired switching frequency.\n2. The circuit board etch between the timing\nresistor, capacitor, RC pin and ground must bekept as short as possible to minimize noisepickup and insure a stable oscillator waveform.\n3. The ground lead of the capacitor must be routed\nclose to the ground lead of the MIC3808/9.\nCurrent Sensing and Overcurrent ProtectionThe CS pin features are:\n1. Peak current limit2. Overcurrent limit3. Internal current sense discharge4. Front edge blanking\nIn current mode control, a PWM comparator uses the inductor\ncurrent signal and the error amplifier signal to determine theoperating duty cycle. In the MIC3808/9 the signal at the CSpin is level shifted up before it reaches the PWM comparatoras shown in Figure 1. This allows operation of the erroramplifier and PWM comparator in a linear region.\nThere are two current limit thresholds in the MIC3808/9; peak\ncurrent limit and overcurrent limit. The normal operatingvoltage at the CS pin is designed less than these thresholds.A pulse-by-pulse current limit occurs when the inductor\ncurrent signal at the CS pin exceeds the peak current limitthreshold. The on-time is terminated for the remainder of theswitching cycle, regardless of whether OUTA or OUTB isactive.\nIf the signal at the CS pin goes past the peak threshold and\nexceeds the overcurrent limit threshold, the overcurrent limitcomparator forces the soft start node to discharge andinitiates a soft start reset.\nAn internal FET discharges the CS pin at the end of the\noscillator charge time. The FET turns on when the voltage onthe RC pin reaches the upper threshold (V\nDD/2) and remains\non for the duration of the RC pin discharge time and fortypically 100ns after the start of the next on-time period. The100ns period at the beginning of the on-time implements afront edge blanking feature that prevents false triggering ofthe PWM comparator due to noise spikes on the leading edgeof the current turn-on signal. The front edge blanking alsosets the minimum on-time for OUTA and OUTB. The timingdiagram for the CS pin is shown in Figure 3.\nRC PinMax ON time\ndead time\nOscillator\nReset\nCS Pin\nOUTA\nOUTBdead time\nFront edge blanking\nMinimum ON time\nFigure 3. Timing Diagram\nError Amplifier\nThe error amplifier is part of the voltage control loop of the\npower supply. The FB pin is the inverting input to the erroramplifier. The non-inverting input is internally connected to areference voltage. The output of the error amplifier, COMP,is connected to the PWM comparator. A voltage dividerbetween the error amplifier output (COMP pin) and the PWMcomparator allows the error amplifier to operate in a linearregion for better transient response. The output of the erroramplifier (COMP pin) is limited to typically 3.65V to preventthe COMP pin from rising up too high during startup or duringa transient condition. This feature improves the transientresponse of the power supply.\nMIC3808/3809 Micrel\nMIC3808/3809 10 April 2005Output Drivers\nOUTA and OUTB are alternating output stages, which switch\nat half the oscillator frequency. A toggle flip-flop in theMIC3808/9 guarantee both outputs will not be on at the sametime. The RC discharge time is the dead time, where bothoutputs are off. This provides an adjustable non-overlap timeto prevent shoot through currents and transformer saturationin the power supply.\nThe output drivers are inhibited when V\nDD is below the\nundervoltage threshold. Internal circuitry prevents the outputdrivers from glitching high when V\nDD is first applied to the\nMIC3808/9 controller.\nDecoupling and PCB LayoutPCB layout is critical to achieve reliable, stable and efficient\noperation. A ground plane is required to control EMI andminimize the inductance in power, signal and return paths.The following guidelines should be followed to insure properoperation of the circuit:\n• Low level signal and power grounds should be kept\nseparate and connected at only one location, preferablythe ground pin of the control IC. The ground signals forthe current sense, voltage feedback and oscillatorshould be grouped together. The return signals for the\ngate drives should be grouped together and a commonconnection made at the ground pin of the controller. Thelow level signals and their returns must be kept separatefrom the high current and high voltage power section ofthe power supply.\n• Avoid running sensitive traces, such as the current\nsense and voltage feedback signals next to or underpower components, such as the switching FETs andtransformer.\n• If a current sense resistor is used, it’s ground end must\nbe located very close to the ground pin of the MIC3808/9 controller. Careful PCB layout is necessary to keepthe high current levels in the current sense resistor fromrunning over the low level signals in the controller.\n• A minimum 1 µf bypass capacitor must be connected\ndirectly between the V\nDD and GND pins of the MIC3808/\n9. An additional 0.1uf capacitor between the VDD end\noscillator frequency setting resistor and the ground endof the oscillator capacitor may be necessary if theresistor is a distance away from the main 1 µF bypass\ncapacitor\nApril 2005 11 MIC3808/3809MIC3808/3809 Micrel\nPackage Information\n45°\n0°–8°\n0.244 (6.20)\n0.228 (5.79)0.197 (5.0)\n0.189 (4.8) SEATING\nPLANE0.026 (0.65)\nMAX )\n0.010 (0.25)\n0.007 (0.18)\n0.064 (1.63)0.045 (1.14)0.0098 (0.249)0.0040 (0.102)0.020 (0.51)0.013 (0.33)0.157 (3.99)\n0.150 (3.81)\n0.050 (1.27)\nTYPPIN 1\nDIMENSIONS:\nINCHES (MM)\n0.050 (1.27)\n0.016 (0.40)\n8-Pin SOIC (M)\n0.008 (0.20)0.004 (0.10)\n0.039 (0.99)\n0.035 (0.89)\n0.021 (0.53)0.012 (0.03) R\n0.0256 (0.65) TYP0.012 (0.30) R\n5° MAX\n0° MIN0.122 (3.10)\n0.112 (2.84)\n0.120 (3.05)\n0.116 (2.95)\n0.012 (0.3)0.007 (0.18)\n0.005 (0.13)0.043 (1.09)0.038 (0.97) 0.036 (0.90)0.032 (0.81)DIMENSIONS:\nINCH (MM)0.199 (5.05)0.187 (4.74)\n8-Pin MSOP (MM)\nMICREL, INC. 2180 FORTUNE DRIVE SAN JOSE, CA 95131 USA\nTEL + 1 (408) 944-0800  FAX + 1 (408) 944-0970  WEB http://www.micrel.com\nThe information furnished by Micrel in this datasheet is believed to be accurate and reliable.
