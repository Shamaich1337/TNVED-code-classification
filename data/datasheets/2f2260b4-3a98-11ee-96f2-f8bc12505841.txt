The switch is ideal for cellular \ninfrastructure applications , yielding up to 62  dB of isolation  up to \n4.0 GHz , a low 0.8  dB of insertion loss  up to 4.0 GHz , and 60 dBm \nof input third -order intercept. Power handling is excellent up to \n6.0 GHz , and it offers  an input power f or an 0.1 dB compression \npoint  (P0.1dB) of 35 dBm  (VDD = 5 V ). On-chip circuitry operates \na single , positive supply voltage from 3.3  V to 5  V , as well as a single, positive voltage control from 0 V to 1.8  V/3.3 V/5.0 V at \nvery low dc  currents. An enable input (EN) set to logic high \nplaces t he switch in an all off  state, in which RFC is reflective.  \nThe HMC8038 has ESD protection on all device pins, including \nthe RF interface, and can stand 4 k V HMB and 1 .25 kV CDM. \nThe HMC8038 offers very fast switching and RF settling times of \n150 ns and 170  ns, respectively. The device comes in a RoHS -\ncomplian t, compact  4 mm × 4 mm LFCSP .  \n \n \nHMC8038  Data Sheet \n \nRev.

A | Page 9 of 11 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe HMC8038 requires a single -supply voltage applied to the \nVDD pin. Bypassing capacitors are recommended on the supply \nline to minimize RF coupling.  \nThe HMC8038 is controlled via two digital control voltages \napplied to the V CTL pin and the EN pin. A small bypassing \ncapacitor is recommended on these digital signal lines to \nimprove the RF signal iso lation.  \nThe HMC8038 is internally matched to 50 Ω at the RF input \nport (RFC) and the RF output ports (RF1 and RF2); therefore, \nno external matching components are required. The RF x pins \nare dc -coupled , and dc  blocking capacitors are required on the \nRF lines. The design is bi directional ; the input and outputs are \ninterchangeable.  \nThe ideal power -up sequence is as follows: \n1. Power up  GND . \n2. Power up  VDD. \n3. Power up the d igital control inputs . The relati ve order of \nthe logic control inputs are not important. Powering the digital control inputs before the V\nDD supply can inadvertently \nforward bias and damage ESD protection structures . \n4. Power up the RF input.  \n With the EN pin is logic low, the HMC8038 has two operation \nmodes: on and off. Depending on the logic level applied to the \nVCTL pin, one RF output port (for example,  RF1) is set to on \nmode , by which an insertion loss path is provided from the \ninput to the output , as the other RF output port (for example,  \nRF2) is set to  off mode , by which the output is isolated from the \ninput. When the RF output port (RF1 or RF2) is in isolation \nmode , internally terminate it to 50 Ω , and the port absorb s the \napplied RF signal.  \nWhen the EN pin is logic high, t he EN pin set s the HMC8038 \nswitch to off mode. In off  mode , both output ports are isolated \nfrom the input , and the RFC port is open  reflective.  \n \n   \n \n  \n \nTable 7.
