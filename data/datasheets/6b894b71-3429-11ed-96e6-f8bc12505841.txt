Related Devices \nPart No.  Description \nAD5663 2.7 V to 5.5 V, dual 16-bit nano DAC, with external \nreference  \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R , members of the nano DAC® \nfamily, are low power, dual 12-, 14-, and 16-bit buffered voltage-\nout digital-to-analog converters (DAC) that operate from a single 2.7 V to 5.5 V supply and are guaranteed monotonic by design. \nThe AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R have an o n-chip reference. \nThe AD5623R-3 /AD5643R-3 /AD5663R-3 hav e a 1.25 V, \n5 ppm/°C refe rence, giving a full-scale  output of 2.5 V; and the \nAD5623R-5/AD5643R-5/AD5663R-5 have a 2.5 V, 5 ppm/°C \nreference, g iving a full-scale output of 5 V. The on-chip \nreference  is off at power-up, allowing the use  of an ext ernal \nreference; and all devices ca n be o perated f rom a single 2.7 V to \n5.5 V supply. Th e internal r eference is turned o n by writing to \nthe D AC. \nThe parts incorporate a power-on reset circuit that ensures the \nDAC output powers up to 0 V and remains there until a valid \nwrite takes place. The part contains a power-down feature that \nreduces the current consumption of the device to 480 nA at 5 V \nand provides software-selectable output loads while in power-\ndown mode. The low power consumption of this part in normal operation \nmakes it ideally suited to portable, battery-operated equipment.  \nThe AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  use a versatile, 3-wire serial \ninterface that operates at clock rates up to 50 MHz, and they are \ncompatible with standard SPI®, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™, and DSP interface standards. The on-chip precision output amplifier \nenables rail-to-rail output swing to be achieved. \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1.Dual 12-, 14-, and 16-bit DAC.\n2.On-chip 1.25 V/2.5 V , 5 ppm/°C reference.\n3.Available in 10-lead MSOP and 10-lead, 3 mm ×\n3 mm LFCSP .\n4.Low power; typically consumes 0.6 mW at 3 V and1.25 mW at 5 V .\n5.4.5 μs maximum settling time for the AD5623R .\nAD5623R/AD5643R/AD5663R Data Sheet\n \nRev.

The outp ut amplifier has rail-to-rail operation. \n2 V OUTB Analog Output Voltage from DAC B. The outp ut amplifier has rail-to-rail operation. \n3 GND  Ground. Reference point for all circuitry on the part.  \n4 LDAC  Pulsing this pin low allows any or all DAC registers to be updated if the input registers have new data.  \nThis allows simultaneous update of  all DAC outputs. Alternatively, this  pin can be tied permanently low. \n5 CLR Asynchronous Clear Input. The CLR  input is falling edge sensitive. While CLR  is low, all LDAC  pulses are  \nignored. When CLR  is activated, zero scale is loaded to all input and DAC registers. This clears the output to 0 V.  \nThe part exits clear code mode on the 24th falling edge of the next write to the part. If CLR  is activated during  \na write sequence, the write is aborted. \n6 SYNC  Level-Triggered Control Input (Active Low). This is the frame synchronization signal for the input data.  \nWhen SYNC  goes low, it enables the input shift register, and data is transferred in on the falling edges of the \nfollowing clocks. The DAC is updated following the 24th clock cycle unless SYNC  is taken high before this edge,  \nin which case the rising edge of SYNC  acts as an interrupt and the write sequence is ignored by the DAC.  \n7 SCLK  Serial Clock Input. Data is clocked in to the input shift register on the falli ng edge of the serial clock input. \nData can be transferred at rates up to 50 MHz.  \n8 DIN  Serial Data Input. This device has a 24-bit shift register. Data is clocked into the register on the falling edge  \nof the serial clock input.  \n9 V DD  Power Supply Input. These parts can be operated from 2.7 V to 5.5 V, and the supply should be decoupled with  \na 10 μF capacitor in parallel with a 0.1 μF capacitor to GND. \n10 V REFIN/VREFOUT  Common Reference Input/Reference Output. When the internal  reference is selected, this is the reference output \npin. When using an external reference, this is the referenc e input pin.  The default for this pin is a reference input. \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD5623R/AD5643R/AD5663R \n \nRev.

G | Page 19 of 32 TERMINOLOGY \nRelative Accuracy or Integral Nonlinearity (INL) \nFor the DAC, relative accuracy or integral nonlinearity is a \nmeasurement of the maximum deviation, in LSBs, from a straight line passing through the endpoints of the DAC transfer \nfunction. A typical INL vs. code plot is shown in Figure 5. \nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL) \nDifferential nonlinearity (DNL) is the difference between the \nmeasured change and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB \nmaximum ensures monotonicity. This DAC is guaranteed \nmonotonic by design. A typical DNL vs. code plot is shown in \nFigure 9. \nZero-Scale Error \nZero-scale error is the measurement of the output error when \nzero code (0x0000) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally, the output should be 0 V . The zero-scale error is always positive in the AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  because the output of the \nDAC cannot go below 0 V . It is due to a combination of the \noffset errors in the DAC and the output amplifier. Zero-scale \nerror is expressed in mV . A plot of zero-scale error vs. \ntemperature is shown in Figure 26. \nFull-Scale Error \nFull-scale error is the measurement of the output error when \nfull-scale code (0xFFFF) is loaded into the DAC register. Ideally, the output should be V\nDD − 1 LSB. Full-scale error is expressed \nin percent of full-scale range. A plot of full-scale error vs. \ntemperature is shown in Figure 25. \nGain Error \nGain error is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the \ndeviation in slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from ideal, \nexpressed as a percent of the full-scale range.  \nZero-Scale Error Drift \nZero-scale error drift is the measurement of the change in zero-\nscale error with a change in temperature. It is expressed in microvolts/°C  (μV/°C).  \nGain Temperature Coefficient  \nGain temperature coefficient is a measurement of the change in \ngain error with changes in temperature. It is expressed in (ppm of full-scale range)/°C. \nOffset Error \nOffset error is a measure of the difference between V\nOUT (actual) \nand V OUT (ideal) expressed in mV in the linear region of the \ntransfer function. Offset error is measured on the AD5623R / \nAD5643R /AD5663R  with code 512 loaded in the DAC register. \nIt can be negative or positive. DC Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) \nPSRR indicates how the output of the DAC is affected by \nchanges in the supply voltage. PSRR is the ratio of the change in VOUT to a change in VDD for full-scale output of the DAC. It is measured in dB. VREF is held at 2 V , and VDD is varied by \n±10%. \nOutput Voltage Settling Time \nOutput voltage settling time is the amount of time it takes for \nthe output of a DAC to settle to a specified level for a 1/4 to 3/4 \nfull-scale input change and is measured from the 24th falling \nedge of SCLK. \nDigital-to-Analog Glitch Impulse \nThe impulse injected into the analog output when the input \ncode in the DAC register changes state. It is normally specified \nas the area of the glitch in nV-sec and is measured when the digital input code is changed by 1 LSB at the major carry \ntransition (0x7FFF to 0x8000). See Figure 38. \nDigital Feedthrough \nA measure of the impulse injected into the analog output of the \nDAC from the digital inputs of the DAC, digital feedthrough is measured when the DAC output is not updated. It is specified in nV-sec, and it is measured with a full-scale code change on the data bus, that is, from all 0s to all 1s and vice versa. \nReference Feedthrough \nReference feedthrough is the ratio of the amplitude of the signal at the DAC output to the reference input when the DAC output \nis not being updated (that is, LDAC\n is high). It is expressed in \ndecibels (dB). \nNoise Spectral Density  \nNoise spectral density is a measurement of the internally \ngenerated random noise. Random noise is characterized as a \nspectral density (nV/√Hz). It is measured by loading the DAC \nto midscale and measuring noise at the output. A plot of noise \nspectral density is shown in Figure 44. \nDC Crosstalk \nDC crosstalk is the dc change in the output level of one DAC in \nresponse to a change in the output of another DAC. It is measured with a full-scale output change on one DAC (or soft power-down and power-up) while monitoring another DAC kept at midscale. It is expressed in microvolts (μV). \nDC crosstalk due to load current change is a measure of the \nimpact that a change in load current on one DAC has to \nanother DAC kept at midscale. It is expressed in microvolts/ \nmilliamps (μV/mA). \n \n \nAD5623R/AD5643R/AD5663R  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

It is measured in standalone mode and is expressed  \nin nanovolts -second ( nV-sec). \nAnalog Crosstalk  \nAnalog crosstalk is the glitch i mpulse transferred to the output \nof one DAC due to a change in the output of another DAC.

This includes both digital and analog crosstalk. It is measured by loading one of the DACs with a full -scale code change (all 0s to all 1s and vice versa) with \nLDAC  low and monitoring the output of another DAC. The \nenergy of the glitch is expressed in nanovolts -second (nV -sec). Multiplying Bandwidth  \nThe amplifiers within the DAC have a finite bandwidth. The multiplying bandwidth is a measure of this. A sine wave on the \nreference (with full -scale code loaded to the DAC) appears on \nthe output. The multiplying bandwidth is the frequency at \nwhich the output amplitude falls to 3 dB below the input.  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)  \nTotal harmonic distortion is the difference bet ween an ideal \nsine wave and its attenuated version using the DAC. The sine \nwave is used as the reference for the DAC, and the THD is a measurement of the harmonics present on the DAC output.  \nIt is measured in decibels ( dB). \n \n  \nData Sheet AD5623R/AD5643R/AD5663R\n \nRev.

The architecture consists of a string DAC \nfollowed by an output buffer amplifier.

It is simply a \nstring of resistors, each of Value R. The code loaded to the DAC \nregister determines at which node on the string the voltage is \ntapped off to be fed into the output amplifier. The voltage is tapped off by closing one of the switches connecting the string to the amplifier. Because it is a string of resistors, it is guaranteed \nmonotonic. \nOUTPUT AMPLIFIER \nThe output buffer amplifier can generate rail-to-rail voltages on \nits output, which gives an output range of 0 V to V DD. It can drive \na load of 2 kΩ in parallel with 1000 pF to GND. The source and sink capabilities of the output amplifier can be seen in Figure 31. The slew rate is 1.8 V/μs with a 1/4 to 3/4 full-scale settling time \nof 10 μs. \n R\nR\nR\nRR TO OUTPUT\nAMPLIFIER\n05858-033 \nFigure 50. Resistor String \nINTERNAL REFERENCE \nThe AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  on-chip reference is off at \npower-up and is enabled via a write to a control register. See the \nInternal Reference Setup section for details. \nThe AD5623R-3/ AD5643R-3 /AD5663R-3  has a 1.25 V , \n5 ppm/°C reference, giving a full-scale output of 2.5 V . The \nAD5623R-5 /AD5643R-5 /AD5663R-5  has a 2.5 V , 5 ppm/°C \nreference, giving a full-scale output of 5 V . The internal reference associated with each part is available at the V\nREFOUT  \npin. A buffer is required if the reference output is used to drive external loads. When using the internal reference, it is recommended that a 100 nF capacitor be placed between reference output and GND for reference stability. \nEXTERNAL REFERENCE \nThe V REFIN pins on the AD5623R-3/ AD5643R-3 /AD5663R-3  \nand the AD5623R-5 /AD5643R-5 /AD5663R-5  allows the use of \nan external reference if the application requires it. The on-chip reference is off at power-up, and this is the default condition. The AD5623R-3 /AD5643R-3 /AD5663R-3  and the AD5623R-5 / \nAD5643R-5 /AD5663R-5  can be operated from a single 2.7 V to \n5.5 V supply. \nSERIAL INTERFACE \nThe AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  have a 3-wire serial interface \n(SYNC , SCLK, and DIN) that is compatible with SPI, QSPI, and \nMICROWIRE interface standards, as well as with most DSPs. See Figure 2 for a timing diagram of a typical write sequence. \nThe write sequence begins by bringing the SYNC\n line low. Data \nfrom the DIN line is clocked into the 24-bit shift register on the \nfalling edge of SCLK. The serial clock frequency can be as high as 50 MHz, making the AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  compatible \nwith high speed DSPs. On the 24th falling clock edge, the last data bit is clocked in and the programmed function is executed, for example, a change in DAC register contents and/or a change \nin the mode of operation.  \nAD5623R/AD5643R/AD5663R Data Sheet  \n \nRev. G | Page 22 of 32 At this stage, the SYNC  line can be kept low or be brought high. \nIn either case, it must be brought high for a minimum of 15 ns \nbefore the next write sequence, so that a falling edge of SYNC  \ncan initiate the next write sequence.  \nBecause the SYNC  buffer draws more current when V IN = 2 V \nthan it does when V IN = 0.8 V , SYNC  should be idled low between  \nwrite sequ ences for even lower power operation. As mentioned \npreviously, it must, however, be brought high again just before \nthe next write sequence.  \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER  \nThe input shift register is 24 bits wide (see Figure 52). The first  \ntwo bits are don’t cares. The next three are Command Bit C2 to Command Bit C0 (see Table 8), followed by the 3 -bit DAC \nAddress A2 to DAC Address A0 (see Table 9 ), and, finally, the \n16-, 14-, and 12 -bit data -word.  \nThe data -word comprises the 16 -, 14-, and 12 -bit input codes, \nfollowed by zero, two, or four don’t care bits, for the AD5663R , \nAD5643R , and AD5623R , respectively (see Figure 51, Figure 52, \nand Figure 53). The data bits are transferred  to the DAC register \non the 24th falling edge of SCLK.  Table 8.

However, if SYNC  is brought high before the \n24th falling edge, this acts as an interrupt to the write sequence. The shift register is reset, and the write sequence is seen as invalid. Neither an update of the DAC register contents nor a change in the operating mode occurs (see \nFigure 54). \nX X C2 C1 C0 A2 A1 A0 D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0DB23 (MSB) DB0 (LSB)\nCOMMAND BITS ADDRESS BITSDATA BITS\n05858-034 \nFigure 51.

G | Page 23 of 32 POWER -ON RESET  \nThe AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  contain a power -on reset \ncircuit that controls the output voltage during power -up. The \nAD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  DACs output power up to 0 V , \nand the output remains there until a valid write sequence is \nmade to the DACs. This is useful in applications where it is impo rtant to know the state of the output of the DACs while \nthey are in the process of powering up. Any events on \nLDAC  or \nCLR  during power -on reset are ignored.  \nSOFTWARE RESET \nThe AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  contain a software reset \nfunction. Command 101 is reserved for the software reset function (se e Table 8 ). The software reset command contains \ntwo reset modes that are software -programmable by setting bit \nDB0 in the control register. Table 10 shows how the state of the \nbit corresponds to the mo de of operation of the device. Table 12 \nshows the contents of the input shift register during the software reset mode of operation.  \nTable 10. Software Reset Modes  \nDB0  Registers Reset to Zero  \n0 DAC register  \n Input register  \n1 (Power -on Reset)  DAC register  \n Input register  \n LDAC  register  \n Power -down register  \n Internal reference setup register  \nAfter a full software reset (DB0 = 1), there must be a short time \ndelay, approximately  5 µs, to allow the reset to complete.  During \nthe reset, a low pulse c an be observed on the CLR  line. If the \nnext SPI tran saction commences before the CLR  line returns \nhigh, that SPI transaction is ignored.  \nPOWER -DOWN MODES  \nThe AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  contain four separate modes \nof operation. Command 1 00 is reserved for the power -down \nfunction (see Table 8 ). These modes are software -programmable \nby setting Bit DB5 and Bit DB4 in the control register. Table 11 \nshows how the state of the bits cor responds to the mode of \noperation of the device. Any or all DACs (DAC B and DAC A) can be powered down to the selected mode by setting the corresponding two bits (Bit DB1 and Bit DB0) to 1.  By executing the same Command 100, any combination of DACs  \ncan be  powered up by setting Bit DB5 and Bit DB4 to normal \noperation mode.  \nAgain, to select which combination of DAC channels to power \nup, set the corresponding bits (Bit DB1 and Bit DB0) to 1. See \nTable 13 for contents of the input sh ift register during power -\ndown/power -up operation.  \nThe DAC output powers up to the value in the input register \nwhile \nLDAC  is low. If  LDAC  is high, the DAC ou tput powers up \nto the value held in the DAC register before pow er-down.  \nTable 11.

However, for the three power -down modes, the supply current \nfalls to 480 nA at 5 V (200 nA at 3 V). Not only does the supply current fall, but the output stage is also internally switched from the output of the amplifier to a resistor network of known values.  \nThis has the advantage that the output impedance of the part is known while the part is in power -down mode. The outputs can \neither be connected internally to GND through a 1  kΩ or 100 kΩ  \nresistor or left open -circuited (three -state) (see Figure 55). \nRESISTOR\nNETWORKVOUTRESISTOR\nSTRING DAC\nPOWER-DOWN\nCIRCUITRYAMPLIFIER\n05858-036 \nFigure 55.

The input registers are connected directly to the input shift regis ter, and the digital code is transferred to the \nrelevant input register on completion of a valid write sequence. \nThe DAC registers contain the digital code used by the resistor \nstrings.  \nAccess to the DAC registers is controlled by the \nLDAC  pin. \nWhen the LDAC  pin is high, the DAC registers are latched and \nthe input registers can change state without affecting the \ncontents of the DAC registers. When LDAC  is brought low, \nhowever, the DAC registers become t ransparent and the \ncontents of the input registers are transferred to them. The \ndouble -buffered interface is useful if the user requires \nsimultaneous updating of all DAC outputs. The user can write to one of the input registers individually and then, by br inging \nLDAC  low when writing to the other DAC input register, all \noutputs will update simultaneously.  \nThese parts each contain an extra feature whereby a DAC \nregister is not updated unless its input register has been updated \nsince the la st time LDAC  was brought low. Normally, when LDAC  \nis brought low, the DAC registers are filled with the contents of \nthe input registers. In the case of the AD5623R /AD5643R / \nAD5663R , the DAC register updates only if the input register \nhas changed since the last time the DAC register was updated, \nthereby removing unnecessary digital crosstalk.  \nThe outputs of all DACs can be simultaneously updated, using \nthe hardware LDAC  pin. \nSynchronous LDAC  \nThe DAC registers are updated after new data is read in on the \nfallin g edge of the 24th SCLK pulse. LDAC  can be permanently \nlow or pulsed as shown in Figure 2 . Asynchronous LDAC  \nThe outputs are not updated at the same time that the input \nregisters are written t o. When LDAC  goes low, the DAC \nregisters are updated with the contents of the input register.  \nThe LDAC  register gives the user full flexibility and control over \nthe hardware LDAC  pin. This register allo ws the user to select \nwhich combination of channels to simultaneously update when the hardware \nLDAC  pin is executed. Setting the LDAC  bit \nregister to 0 for a DAC channel means that the update of this channel is controlle d by the \nLDAC  pin. If this bit is set to 1, this \nchannel synchronously updates; that is, the DAC register is \nupdated after new data is read in, regardless of the state of the \nLDAC  pin. It effectively sees the LDAC  pin as being pulled low. \nSee Table 15 for the LDAC  register mode of operation. This \nflexibility is useful in applications where the user wants to simultaneously update select channels while the rest  of the \nchannels are synchronously updating.  \nWriting to the DAC using Command 110 loads the 2- bit \nLDAC  \nregister [DB1:DB0]. The default for each channel is 0; that is, \nthe LDAC  pin works normally. Setting the bits to 1 m eans the \nDAC register is updated, regardless of the state of the LDAC  \npin. See Table 14 for contents of the input shift register during \nthe LDAC  register setup command.  \nTable 15.

AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  to 68HC11/68L11 Interface  \nThe SYNC  signal is derived from a port line (PC7). The setup \nconditions for correct operation of this interface are as follows: \nthe 68HC11/68L11 is configured with its  CPOL bit as 0, and its \nCPHA bit as 1. When data is being transmitted to the DAC, the \nSYNC  line is taken low (PC7). When the 68HC11/68L11 is \nconfigured as described previously, data appearing on the MOSI \noutput is valid on the fallin g edge of SCK. Serial data from the \n68HC11/68L11 is transmitted in 8- bit bytes with only eight \nfalling clock edges occurring in the transmit cycle.  \nData is transmitted MSB first. To load data to the AD5623R / \nAD5643R /AD5663R , PC7 is left low after the first eight bits are \ntransferred, and a second serial write operation is perfo rmed to \nthe DAC. PC7 is taken high at the end of this procedure.  AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R  to 80C51/80L51 Interface  \nFigure 58 shows a serial interface between the AD5623R / \nAD5643R /AD5663R  and the 80C51/80L51 microcontroller. The \nsetup for the interface is as follows: TxD of the 80C51/ 80L51 drives SCLK of the AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R , and RxD \ndrives the serial data line of the part. The \nSYNC  signal is again \nderived from a bit -programmable pin on the port.  In this case, \nPort Line P3.3 is used. When data is to be transmitted  to the \nAD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R , P3.3 is taken low. The 80C51/ \n80L51 transmit data in 8- bit bytes only; thus, only eight falling \nclock edges occur in the transmit cycle. To load data to the DAC, P3.3 is left low after the first eigh t bits are transmitted, \nand a second write cycle is initiated to transmit the second byte of data. P3.3 is taken high following the completion of this cycle.  \nThe 80C51/80L51 output the serial data in a format that has the LSB first.

G | Page 27 of 32 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nUSING A REFERENCE AS A POWER SUPPLY \nBecause the supply current required by the AD5623R /AD5643R / \nAD5663R  is extremely low, an alternative option is to use a \nvoltage reference to supply the required voltage to the parts (see \nFigure 60). This is especially useful if the power supply is quite \nnoisy or if the system supply voltages are at some value other \nthan 5 V or 3 V , for example, 15 V . The voltage reference outputs a steady supply voltage for the AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R . \nIf the low dropout REF195 is used, it must supply 500 μA of \ncurrent to the AD5623R /AD5643R /AD5663R , with no load on \nthe output of the DAC. When the DAC output is loaded, the \nREF195 also needs to supply the current to the load. The total \ncurrent required (with a 5 kΩ load on the DAC output) is \n500 μA + (5 V/5 kΩ) = 1.5 mA \nThe load regulation of the REF195 is typically 2 ppm/mA, \nwhich results in a 3 ppm (15 μV) error for the 1.5 mA current \ndrawn from it. This corresponds to a 0.196 LSB error for the \n16-bit AD5663R . \nAD5623R/\nAD5643R/\nAD5663RTHREE-WIRE\nSERIAL\nINTERFACESYNC\nSCLK\nDIN15V\n5V\nVOUT = 0V TO 5VVDDREF195\n05858-041 \nFigure 60.

Bipolar Operation with the AD5663R  \nUSING THE AD5663R WITH A \nGALVANICALLY ISOLATED INTERFACE \nIn process control applications in industrial environments,  \nit is often necessary to use a galvanically isolated interface to \nprotect and isolate the controlling circuitry from any hazardous common-mode voltages that can occur in the area where  the DAC is functioning. iCoupler® provides isolation in excess \nof 2.5 kV . The AD5663R  uses a 3-wire serial logic interface, so \nthe ADuM1300  3-channel digital isolator provides the required \nisolation (see Figure 62). The power supply to the part also needs to be isolated, which is done by using a transformer. On \nthe DAC side of the transformer, a 5 V regulator provides the \n5 V supply required for the AD5663R . \n0.1µF5V\nREGULATOR\nGNDDINSYNCSCLKPOWER 10µF\nSDISCLK\nDATAAD5663R\nVOUT VOBVOA\nVOCVDD\nVICVIBVIA\nADuM1300\n05858-043 \nFigure 62.

G | Page 28 of 32 POWER SUPPLY BYPASSING AND GROUNDING  \nWhen accuracy is important in a circuit, it is helpful to carefully \nconsider the power supply and ground return layout on the \nboard. The printed circuit board containing the AD5663R  \nshould have separate analog and digital sections, each having its \nown area of the board.  \nIf the AD5663R  is in a system where other devices require an \nAGND -to-DGND connection, the connection should be made at \none point only. This ground point should be as close as possible to the AD5663R . \nThe power supply to the AD5663R  should be bypassed with 10 µF \nand 0.1 µF capacitors. The capacitors should be located as close as possible to the device, with the 0.1 µF capacito r ideally right \nup against the device. The 10 µF capacitors are the tantalum bead type. It is important that the 0.1 µF capacitor have low effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESI), which is found, for example,  in common ceram ic types of \ncapacitors.  This 0.1 µF capacitor provides a low impedance path to ground for high frequencies caused by transient currents due to internal logic switching.  \nThe power supply line itself should have as large a trace as possible to provide a low  impedance path and to reduce glitch \neffects on the supply line. Clocks and other fast switching digital signals should be shielded from other parts of the board by digital ground. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals, if possible. When traces cross on opposite sides of the board, ensure that they run at right angles to each other to reduce \nfeedthrough effects through the board. The best board layout \ntechnique is the microstrip technique, where the component side of the board is dedicated to the gr ound plane only and the \nsignal traces are placed on the solder side. However, this is not always possible with a 2 -layer board.  \n \n \n \nData Sheet AD5623R/AD5643R/AD5663R\n \nRev.
