#### Description:
The GBL08-E3/45 is a glass passivated single-phase bridge rectifier. Its primary function is to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) in various electronic applications. The bridge rectifier consists of four diodes arranged in a bridge configuration, allowing it to rectify both halves of the AC waveform.

#### Typical Applications:
The GBL08-E3/45 is commonly used in:
- General-purpose AC/DC bridge full-wave rectification
- Power supplies for monitors, televisions, printers, and audio equipment
- Switching mode power supplies (SMPS)
- Adapters and home appliances

This component is ideal for printed circuit board (PCB) applications due to its compact size and high surge current capability, making it suitable for a wide range of consumer electronics and industrial applications.
