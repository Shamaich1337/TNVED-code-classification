The MLA \nSeries is typically applied to protect integrated circuits and other \ncomponents at the circuit board level.\nThe wide operating voltage and energy range make the MLA \nSeries suitable for numerous applications on power supply, control \nand signal lines.\nThe MLA Series is manufactured from semiconducting ceramics, \nand is supplied in a leadless, surface mount package. The MLA \nSeries is compatible with modern reflow and wave soldering \nprocedures.\nIt can operate over a wider temperature range than Zener diodes, \nand has a much smaller footprint than plastic-housed components.\nLittelfuse Inc. manufactures other multilayer series products.

CLAMPING VOLTAGE OVER TEMPER ATURE\n(VC AT 10A)Typical Temperature Dependance of the Haracteristic \nCurve in the Leakage Region\nSpeed of Response\nThe Multilayer Suppressor is a leadless device. Its response time \nis not limited by the parasitic lead inductances found in other \nsurface mount packages. The response time of the ZNO dielectric \nmaterial is less than 1ns and the MLA can clamp very fast dV/dT \nevents such as ESD. Additionally, in "real world" applications, the \nassociated circuit wiring is often the greatest factor effecting \nspeed of response. Therefore, transient suppressor placement \nwithin a circuit can be considered important in certain instances .Energy Absorption/Peak Current \nCapability\nEnergy dissipated within the MLA Series is calculated by \nmultiplying the clamping voltage, transient current and transient \nduration. An important advantage of the multilayer is its \ninterdigitated electrode construction within the mass of dielectric \nmaterial. This results in excellent current distribution and the peak \ntemperature per energy absorbed is very low. The matrix of \nsemiconducting grains combine to absorb and distribute transient \nenergy (heat) (see Speed of Response). This dramatically reduces \npeak temperature; thermal stresses and enhances device reliability.\nAs a measure of the device capability in energy and peak current \nhandling, the V26MLA1206A part was tested with multiple pulses \nat its peak current rating (3A, 8/20µs). At the end of the \ntest,10,000 pulses later, the device voltage characteristics are still \nwell within specification. \n100\n10\n0V26MLA1 206\n2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000\nNUMBER OF PULSESVOLTAGE\nFIGURE 13.REPETITIVE PULSE CAPABILITYPEAK CURRENT = 3A\n8/20 s DUR ATION,  30s BETWEEN PULSESRepetitive Pulse CapabilityFigure 10Figure 11\nGRAINSDEPLE TIONFIRED CERAMIC\nDIELECTRIC\nREGIONMETAL\nELECTR ODES\nDEPLE TION\nREGIONMETAL END\nTERMINA TION\nFIGURE 11.MULTILAYER INTERNAL CONS TRUCTIONMultilayer Internal Construction\nFigure 12 Figure 13\nVaristor Datasheet© 2021 Littelfuse, Inc.\nSpecifications are subject to change without notice.\nRevised: GD. 05/12/217\nMLA Varistor Series\nSurface Mount Multilayer Varistors (MLVs)Lead (Pb) Soldering Recommendations\nThe principal techniques used for the soldering of components in \nsurface mount technology are IR Re-flow and Wave soldering. \nTypical profiles are shown on the right.\nThe recommended solder for the MLA suppressor is a 62/36/2 \n(Sn/Pb/Ag), 60/40 (Sn/Pb) or 63/37 (Sn/Pb). Littelfuse also \nrecommends an RMA solder flux.\nWave soldering is the most strenuous of the processes. To avoid \nthe possibility of generating stresses due to thermal shock, a \npreheat stage in the soldering process is recommended, and the \npeak temperature of the solder process should be rigidly \ncontrolled.\nWhen using a reflow process, care should be taken to ensure that \nthe MLA chip is not subjected to a thermal gradient steeper than 4 \ndegrees per second; the ideal gradient being 2 degrees per \nsecond. During the soldering process, preheating to within 100 \ndegrees of the solder\'s peak temperature is essential to minimize \nthermal shock.\nOnce the soldering process has been completed, it is still \nnecessary to ensure that any further thermal shocks are avoided. \nOne possible cause of thermal shock is hot printed circuit boards \nbeing removed from the solder process and subjected to cleaning \nsolvents at room temperature. The boards must be allowed to cool \ngradually to less than 50º C before cleaning.\nLead–free (Pb-free) Soldering Recommendations\nLittelfuse offers the Nickel Barrier Termination option (see "N" \nsuffix in Part Numbering System for ordering) for the optimum \nLead–free solder performance, consisting of a Matte Tin outer \nsurface plated on Nickel underlayer, plated on Silver base metal. \nThe preferred solder is 96.5/3. %.5 (SnAgCu) with an RMA flux, \nbut there is a wide selection of pastes and fluxes available with \nwhich the Nickel Barrier parts should be compatible.\nThe reflow profile must be constrained by the maximums in the \nLead–free Reflow Profile. For Lead–free wave soldering, the Wave \nSolder Profile still applies.\nNote: the Lead–free paste, flux and profile were used for \nevaluation purposes by Littelfuse, based upon industry standards \nand practices. There are multiple choices of all three available, it is \nadvised that the customer explores the optimum combination for \ntheir process as processes vary considerably from site to site.FIGURE 14.REFL OW SOLDER PROFILE\nFIGURE 15.WAVE SOLDER PROFILE\nFIGURE 16.LEAD-FREE RE-FLOW  SOLDER PR OFILETIME (MINUTES)300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n0.0 0.5 1.01 .5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5MAXIMUM WAVE 260°C\nSECOND PREHEA T\nFIRS T PREHEA T\nMAXIMUM TEMPER ATURE 260˚C,\nTIME WITHIN 5˚C OF PEAK\n20 SECONDS MAXIMUM\nPREHEA T ZONERAMP RA TE\n<3˚C/s 60 -
