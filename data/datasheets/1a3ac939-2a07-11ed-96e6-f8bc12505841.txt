The ADRF5026 features an all off control, where both RF ports are in an isolation \nstate. The ADRF5026 has a nonrefle ctive design and both of the \nRF ports are internally terminated to 50 Ω.  \nThe ADRF5026 requires a dual-su pply voltage of +3.3 V and \n−3.3 V. The device employs complimentary metal-oxide \nsemiconductor/low-voltage transistor-transistor logic \n(CMOS/LVTTL) logic-compatible controls. The ADRF5026 is pin-compatible with the ADRF5027  low \nfrequency cutoff version, which operates from 9 kHz to 44 GHz. \nThe ADRF5026 RF ports ar e designed to match a characteristic \nimpedance of 50 Ω. For ultrawideband products, impedance matching on the RF transmission lines can further optimize high frequency insertion loss and return loss characteristics. Refer to the Narrow-Band Impedance Matching section for an example of a matched circuit that achieves a flat insertion loss response of 2.4 dB from 28 GHz to 43 GHz. \nThe ADRF5026 comes in a 20-terminal, 3 mm × 3 mm, RoHS-\ncompliant, land grid array (LGA) package and can operate \nfrom −40°C to +105°C. \nADRF5026 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

A | Page 9 of 13 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADRF5026 requires a positive supply voltage applied to the \nVDD pin and a negative supply voltage applied to the VSS pin. \nBypassing capacitors are recomm ended on the supply lines to \nfilter high frequency noise. \nAll of the RF ports (RFC, RF1, and RF2) are dc-coupled to 0 V, \nand no dc blocking capacitors are required at the RF ports \nwhen the RF potential is equal to 0 V. \nThe RF ports are internally matched to 50 Ω. Therefore, \nexternal matching networks are not required. Impedance \nmatching on the RF transmissi on lines can improve insertion \nloss and return loss performance at high frequencies. \nThe ADRF5026 integrates a driver  to perform logic function \ninternally and to provide the ad vantage of a simplified control \ninterface. The driver features two digital control input pins, \nCTRL and EN. When the EN pin is logic low, the logic level \napplied to the CTRL pin determines which RF port is in \ninsertion loss state and which RF port is in isolation state. \nThe ADRF5026 supports an all off state control. When the EN \npin is logic high, both the RF1 to RFC path and the RF2 to RFC \npath are in an isolation state, regardless of the logic state of the CTRL pin. The RF1 and RF2 port s are terminated to internal \n50 Ω resistors, and the RFC port becomes open reflective (see \nTable 5). The ADRF5026 design is bidire ctional with equal power \nhandling capabilities. An  RF input signal (RF\nIN) can be applied \nto the RFC port or the RF1 or  RF2 port. The isolation path \nprovides high loss between the unselected RFx port and the insertion loss path. \nThe ideal power-up sequence is as follows:  \n1. Connect GND. \n2. Power up VDD and VSS. Power up VSS after VDD to \navoid current transients on VDD during ramp-up.  \n3. Apply the digital control inputs. The relative order of the \ndigital control inputs is not important. However, powering the digital control inputs before the VDD supply may inadvertantly forward bias and damage the internal ESD \nprotection structures. To avoi d this damage, use a series \n1 kΩ resistor to limit the curre nt flowing in to the control \npin. Use pull-up or pull-down resistors if the controller \noutput is in a high impedance state after VDD is powered up and the control pins are not driven to a valid logic state. \n4. Apply an RF input signal to RFC, RF1, or RF2. \nThe ideal power-down sequence is the reverse order of the power-up sequence. \n \nTable 5.

Evaluation Board Stack Up \nAll RF and dc traces are routed on the top copper layer, \nwhereas the inner and bottom layers are ground planes that provide a solid ground for the RF transmission lines. The top dielectric material is 8 mil Rogers RO4003, which offers optimal high frequency performance. The middle and bottom \ndielectric materials provide mechanical strength. The overall \nboard thickness is 62 mil, which allows 2.4 mm RF launchers to \nbe connected at the board edges. \n16767-016 \nFigure 16. Evaluation Board Layout \nThe RF transmission lines ar e designed using a coplanar \nwaveguide (CPWG) model with a width of 14 mil and a ground spacing of 7 mil, and have a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω. For optimal RF and thermal grounding, as many plated through vias as possible are arra nged around transmission lines \nand under the exposed pad of the package. \nThe RF input and output ports (RFC, RF1, and RF2) are connected \nthrough 50 Ω transmission lines to the 2.4 mm launchers (J1, J2, \nand J3, respectively). These hi gh frequency RF launchers are \nconnected by contact and are not soldered to the board. \nThe thru calibration line, THRU CAL, can calibrate out the \nboard loss effects from the ADRF5026-EVALZ  evaluation board \nmeasurements to determine the device performance at the pins of the IC. Figure 17 shows the typical board loss for the ADRF5026-EVALZ  evaluation board at room temperature, the \nembedded insertion loss, and the de-embedded insertion loss for the ADRF5026. 0\n–8–7–6–5–4–3–2–1\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45INSERTION LOSS (dB)\nFREQUENCY (GHz)DEEMBEDDED ILEMBEDDED ILTHRU LOSS\n16767-017 \nFigure 17.

Probing reduces the reflections caused by mismatch arising \nfrom connectors, cables, and board layout, resulting in a more \naccurate measurement of insertio n loss and return loss. Signal \ncoupling between the RF probes limits the isolation measurement. The ADRF5026-EVALZ  evaluation board is used \nfor making isolation measurements. \nRF traces for a through-reflect-line (TRL) calibration are \ndesigned on the probe matrix board. Board loss is compensated \nfor by using a nonzero line length at calibration. The actual board duplicates the same layout  in matrix form, which allows \nmultiple devices to assemble at  once. Insertion loss and return \nloss measurements are made on this board, while isolation \nmeasurements are made on the ADRF5026-EVALZ  evaluation \nboard. \nRFCVSS\nENCTRL\nVDDRF2\nEPAD\nRF1\n16767-0207mil\n7mil14mil 8mil10mil\n \nFigure 21.
