Pin Configuration and Descriptions\nTable 1-1. Pin Descriptions\nPin Description\nDATA Three-state DATA Output for Configuration . Open-collector bi-directional pin for programming.\nDCLKClock Output or Clock Input . Rising edges on DCLK increment the internal address counter and present \nthe next bit of data to the DATA pin. The counter is incremented only if the RESET/ OE input is held High, \nthe nCS input is held Low, and all configuration data has not been transferred to the target device (otherwise, as the master device, the DCLK pin drives Low).\nWP1Write Protect (1) . This pin is used to protect portions of memory during programming, and it is disabled \nby default due to internal pull-down resistor. This input pin is not used during FPGA loading operations. This pin is only available on the AT17LV512A/010A/002A.\nRESET/OERESET  (Active Low) / Output Enable (Active High) when SER_EN is High. A Low logic level resets the \naddress counter. A High logic level (with nCS Low) enables DATA and permits the address counter to count. In the mode, if this pin is Low (reset), the internal oscillator becomes inactive and DCLK drives Low. The logic polarity of this input is programmable and must be programmed active High (RESET active Low) by the user during programming for Altera applications.\nWPWrite Protect Input (when nCS is Low) during programming only ( SER_EN Low). When WP is Low, the \nentire memory can be written. When WP is enabled (High), the lowest block of the memory cannot be written. This pin is only available on AT17LV65A/128A/256A devices.\nnCSChip Select Input  (Active Low). A Low input (with OE High) allows DCLK to increment the address \ncounter and enables DATA to drive out. If the AT17LVxxxA is reset with nCS Low, the device initializes as the first (and master) device in a daisy-chain. If the AT17LVxxxA is reset with nCS High, the device initializes as a subsequent AT17LVxxxA in the chain.\nGND Ground . A 0.2μF decoupling capacitor between VCC and GND is recommended.\nnCASCCascade Select Output (Active Low). This output goes Low when the address counter has reached its \nmaximum value. In a daisy-chain of AT17LVxxxA devices, the nCASC pin of one device is usually connected to the nCS input pin of the next device in the chain, which permits DCLK from the master configurator to clock data from a subsequent AT17LVxxxA device in the chain. This feature is not available on the AT17LV65A (NRND).\nA2Device Selection Input, A2. This is used to enable (or select) the device during programming (i.e., when \nSER_EN is Low). A2 has an internal pull-down resistor.\nREADYOpen Collector Reset State Indicator. Driven Low during power-on reset cycle, released when power-\nup is complete. (recommended 4.7k \uf057 pull-up on this pin if used).\nSER_ENSerial Enable  must be held High during FPGA loading operations. Bringing SER_EN Low enables the 2-\nwire Serial Programming Mode. For non-ISP applications, SER_EN should be tied to VCC.\nVCC Power Supply.  3.3V (±10%) and 5.0V (±10%) power supply pin.\n 3 AT17LV65A/128A/256A/512A/002A [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-2322I-FPGA-AT17LV65A-128A-256A-512A-002A-Datasheet_102014Table 1-2.

Device Description\nThe control signals for the configuration EEPROM (nCS, RESET/ OE and DCLK) interface directly with the \nFPGA device control signals. All FPGA devices can control the entire configuration process and retrieve data from the configuration EEPROM without requiring an external controller.\nThe configuration EEPROM’s RESET/\nOE and nCS pins control the tri-state buffer on the DATA output pin and \nenable the address counter and the oscillator. When RESET/ OE is driven Low, the configuration EEPROM \nresets its address counter and tri-states its DATA pin. The nCS pin also controls the output of the AT17LVxxxA configurator. If nCS is held High after the RESET/\nOE pulse, the counter is disabled and the DATA output pin is \ntri-stated. When nCS is driven subsequently Low, the counter and the DATA output pin are enabled. When RESET/\nOE is driven Low again, the address counter is reset and the DATA output pin is tri-stated, regardless of \nthe state of the nCS.\nWhen the configurator has driven out all of its data and nCASC is driven Low, the device tri-states the DATA pin \nto avoid contention with other configurators. Upon power-up, the address counter is automatically reset.\nThis is the default setting for the device. Since almost all FPGAs use RESET Low and OE High, this document \nwill describe RESET/OE.\n4. FPGA Master Serial Mode Summary\nThe I/O and logic functions of any SRAM-based FPGA are established by a configuration program. The program is loaded either automatically upon power-up, or on command, depending on the state of the FPGA mode pins. In Master mode, the FPGA automatically loads the configuration program from an external memory. The AT17LVxxxA Serial Configuration EEPROM has been designed for compatibility with the Master Serial mode.\nThis document discusses the Altera FLEX FPGA device interfaces.\n5. Control of Configuration\nMost connections between the FPGA device and the AT17LVxxxA Serial EEPROM are simple and self-\nexplanatory.\n\uf06cThe DATA output of the AT17LVxxxA configurator drives DIN of the FPGA devices.\n\uf06cThe master FPGA DCLK output or external clock source drives the DCLK input of the AT17LVxxxA \nconfigurator.\n\uf06cThe nCASC output of any AT17LVxxxA configurator drives the nCS input of the next configurator in a \ncascaded chain of EEPROMs. \n\uf06cSER_EN must be connected to VCC (except during ISP). \nAT17LV65A/128A/256A/512A/002A [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-2322I-FPGA-AT17LV65A-128A-256A-512A-002A-Datasheet_102014 66. Cascading Serial Configuration EEPROMs \nFor multiple FPGAs configured as a daisy-chain, or for FPGAs requiring larger configuration memories, \ncascaded configurators provide additional memory.\nAfter the last bit from the first configurator is read, the next clock signal to the configurator asserts its nCASC \noutput low and disables its DATA line driver. The second configurator recognizes the low level on its nCS input and enables its DATA output.\nAfter configuration is complete, the address counters of all cascaded configurators are reset if the RESET/\nOE \non each configurator is driven to a Low level.\nIf the address counters are not to be reset upon completion, then the RESET/ OE input can be tied to a High \nlevel.\nThe AT17LV65A (NRND) does not have the nCASC feature to perform cascaded configurations.\n7. AT17LVxxxA Reset Polarity\nThe AT17LVxxxA configurator allows the user to program the polarity of the RESET/ OE pin as either \nRESET/ OE or RESET/OE. This feature is supported by industry-standard programmer algorithms.\n8. Programming Mode \nThe programming mode is entered by bringing SER_EN Low. In this mode the chip can be programmed by the \n2-wire serial bus. The programming is done at VCC supply only. Programming super voltages are generated \ninside the chip.\n9. Standby Mode\nThe AT17LVxxxA enters a low-power standby mode whenever nCS is asserted High. In this mode, the configurator consumes less than 150 μA of current at 3.3V. The output remains in a high-impedance state \nregardless of the state of the RESET/\nOE input.\n 7 AT17LV65A/128A/256A/512A/002A [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-2322I-FPGA-AT17LV65A-128A-256A-512A-002A-Datasheet_10201410.
