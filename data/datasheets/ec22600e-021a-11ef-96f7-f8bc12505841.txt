There are two way s \nto change these settings: \n/circle6 \nDirectly change the active setting register value \n(VoutVSEL0[6..0] of PROGVSEL0 register or \nVoutVSEL1[6..0] of the PROGVSEL1 register) \nvia I\n2\nC command. \n/circle6 \nChange the VSEL internal signal level by \ntoggling VSEL pin. \nThe second method eliminates the I\n2\nC latency and \ntherefore faster.  \nVSEL Pin \nBy changing VSEL pin levels, the user has a latency \n \nmode (Auto or PWM forced), the output voltage as \nwell as enable.\n \nVSEL pin action can be masked by \nwriting 0 to the VSELGT bit in the COMMAND \nregister. In that case I\n2\nC bit corresponding to VSEL \nhigh will be taken into account. \nPower Good Pin (Optional) \nTo indicate the output voltage level is established , a \npower good signal is available. The power good pin is \npulled down when the DC-DC converter is off. Once \nthe output voltage reaches 93% of the expected outp ut level, the power good logic signal becomes high and \nthe open drain output becomes high impedance. \nDuring operation when the output drops below 90% \nof the programmed level, the power good logic signa l \ngoes low and the open drain signal transitions to a \nlow impedance state, which indicates a power failur e. \nWhen the voltage rises again to above 93% the power \ngood signal goes high again. \nDuring a positive DVS sequence, when target voltage \nis higher than initial voltage, the Power Good logi c \nsignal will be set low during output voltage rampin g \nand transition to high once the output voltage reac hes \n93% of the target voltage. When the target voltage is \nlower than the initial voltage, Power Good pin will \nremain at high level during transition. \nPower Good signal during normal operation can be \ndisabled by clearing the PGDCDC bit in PGOOD \nregister. \nPower Good operation during DVS can be controlled \nby setting / clearing the bit PGDVS in PGOOD \nregister. \nIn order to generate a Reset signal, a delay can be \nprogrammed between the output voltage gets 93% of \nits final value and Power Good pin is released to h igh \nlevel. The delay is set through the TOR[1..0] bits in \nthe TIME register. The default delay is 0 ms. \nI\n2\nC interface  \nDescription \nI\n2\nC is a 2-wire serial interface developed by Philips \nSemiconductor (see I\n2\nC-Bus Specification, Version \n2.1, January 2000). The bus consists of a data line \n(SDA) and a clock line (SCL) with pull-up structure s. \nWhen the bus is idle, both SDA and SCL lines are \npulled high. All the I\n2\nC compatible devices connect to \nthe I\n2\nC bus through open drain I/O pins, SDA and \nSCL. A master device, usually a microcontroller or a \ndigital signal processor, controls the bus. The mas ter \nis responsible for generating the SCL signal and \ndevice addresses. The master also generates specifi c \nconditions that indicate the START and STOP of data \ntransfer. A slave device receives and/or transmits data \non the bus under control of the master device. \nthe following data transfer modes, as defined in th e \nI\n2\nC-Bus Specification: standard mode (100 kbps), fast \nmode (400 kbps), and high-speed mode (up to 3.4 \nMbps in write mode). The interface adds flexibility  to \nthe power supply solution, enabling most functions to \nbe programmed to new values depending on the \ninstantaneous application requirements. The data \ntransfer protocol for standard and fast modes is \nexactly the same. Therefore, they are referred to a s \nF/S-mode in this document. The protocol for \nhigh-speed mode is identical with the F/S-mode \nexcept the bus speed, and it is referred to as \nHS-mode.   \nMSBs are 0011100. \n                                          \n \n     5A, 3MHz Synchronous Step-Down  \nDC-DC with I\n2\nC Compatible Interface \nVer.1.0  May.26,2015    Page       13 \nTCS4525\n \nFast/Standard (F/S) Mode Protocol \nThe master initiates data transfer by generating a \nstart condition. The start condition is when a \nhigh-to-low transition occurs on the SDA line while \nSCL is high, see Figure 7. All I\n2\nC-compatible \ndevices should recognize a start condition. \nThe master then generates the SCL pulses, and \ntransmits the 7-bit address and the read/write \ndirection bit R/W on the SDA line. During all \ntransmissions, the master ensures that data is vali d. A \nvalid data condition requires the SDA line to be \nstable during the entire high period of the clock p ulse, \nsee Figure 8. All devices recognize the address sen t \nby the master and compare it to their internal fixe d \naddresses. Only the slave device with a matching \naddress generates an  acknowledge bit, see Figure 9, \nby pulling the SDA line low during the entire high \nperiod of the ninth SCL cycle. Upon detecting this \nacknowledge, the master knows that the \ncommunication link with a slave has been \nestablished. \nThe master generates further SCL cycles to either \ntransmit data to the slave (R/W bit 1) or receive d ata \nfrom the slave (R/W bit 0). In either case, the \nreceiver needs to acknowledge the data sent by the \ntransmitter. An acknowledge signal can either be \ngenerated by the master or by the slave, depending \non which one is the receiver. 9-bit valid data \nsequences consisting of 8-bit data and 1-bit \nacknowledge can continue as long as necessary. \nTo signal the end of the data transfer, the master \ngenerates a stop condition by pulling the SDA line \nfrom low to high while the SCL line is high, see \nFigure 7. This releases the bus and stops the \ncommunication link with the addressed slave. All I\n2\nC \ncompatible devices must recognize the stop conditio n. \nUpon the receipt of a stop condition, all devices \nknow that the bus is released, and they wait for a \nstart condition followed by a matching address. \nHigh Speed (HS) Mode When the bus is idle, both SDA and SCL lines are \npulled high by the pull-up devices. \nThis transmission is made in F/S-mode at no more \nthan 400 Kbps. No device is allowed to acknowledge \nthe HS master code, but all devices must recognize it \nand switch their internal setting to support 3.4-Mb ps \noperation. \nThe master then generates a repeated start conditio n (a \nrepeated start condition has the same timing as the \nstart condition). After this repeated start conditi on, the \nprotocol is the same as F/S-mode, except that \ntransmission speeds up to 3.4 Mbps are allowed. A \nstop condition ends the HS-mode.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure7.Start and Stop conditions  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure8.Bit Transfer on the Serial Interface \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure9.Acknowledge on the I\n2\nC Bus  \n                                          \n \n     5A, 3MHz Synchronous Step-Down  \nDC-DC with I\n2\nC Compatible Interface \nVer.1.0  May.26,2015    Page       14 \nTCS4525\nDefault values of TCS4525 are shown below: C address selects the TCS4525.

The output inductor is selected to limit the \nripple current to some predetermined value, typical ly \n20%~40% of the full load current at the maximum \ninput voltage. Large value inductors lower ripple \ncurrents. Higher V\nIN\n or V\nOUT\n also increases the ripple \ncurrent as shown in equation. \n\uf8f7    \n \nThe DC current rating of the inductor should be at least \nequal to the maximum load current plus half the rip ple \ncurrent to prevent core saturation. The DC resistan ce of \nthe inductor directly influences the efficiency of the \nconverter. Therefore for better efficiency, choose a low \nDC-resistance inductor.  \nCIN and COUT Selection \nIn continuous mode, the source current of the \nP-Channel MOSFET is a square wave of duty cycle \nV\nOUT\n/V\nIN\n.

The size required will vary depending  on \nthe load, output voltage and input voltage source \nimpedance characteristics. A typically C\nIN\n value is \naround 10µF. If the wire of supply is too long, lar ger \ninput capacitor should be used, 22µF is preferred. \nThe input capacitor RMS current varies with the inp ut \nvoltage and the output voltage. The equation for th e \nmaximum RMS current in the input capacitor is: \n    \n \n \nThe output capacitor C\nOUT\n has a strong effect on loop \nstability. The selection of C\nOUT\n is driven by the \nrequired effective series resistance (ESR). ESR is a \ndirect function of the volume of the capacitor; tha t is, \nphysically larger capacitors have lower ESR. Once t he \nESR requirement for C\nOUT\n has been met, the RMS \ncurrent rating generally far exceeds the IRIPPLE(P- P) \nrequirement.
