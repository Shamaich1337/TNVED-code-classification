Input IP3 vs. Frequency over Various Temperatures \n(Low  Frequency Detail)  \n \nADRF5047  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 10 of 15 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADRF5047  requires a positive supply voltage applied to the \nVDD pin and a negative supply voltage applied to the VSS pin. \nBypassing capacitors are recommended on the supply lines to minimize RF coupling.  \nAll of the RF ports (RFC, RF1 to RF4) are dc -coupled to 0 V , \nand no dc blocking is required at the RF ports when the RF line potential is equal to 0 V . The RF ports are internally matched to \n50 Ω. Therefore, external matching networks ar e not required.  \nThe ADRF5 047 integrates  a driver to perform logic functions \ninternally and to provide the user with the advantage of a \nsimplified CMOS/LVTTL -compatible control interface. The \ndriver features two digital control input pins (V1 and V2 ) that \ncontrol the state of the RF paths. The logic level applied to the \nV1 and V2 pins determines which RF port is in the insertion \nloss state, while the other three paths are in the isolation state (see Table 5). \nThe insertion loss path conducts the RF signal between the \nselected RF throw port and the RF common port. The switch design is bidirectional with equal power handling capa bilities. \nThe RF input signal can be applied to the RFC port or the \nselected RF throw port.  The isolation paths provide high loss \nbetween the insertion loss path and the unselected RF throw \nports that are reflective.  The ideal power -up sequence is as follows:  \n1. Connect GND.  \n2. Power up VDD and VSS. Power up VSS after VDD to avoid current transients on VDD during ramp up.  \n3. Apply digital control inputs , V1 and V2. Applying these \ndigital control inputs before applying the VDD supply inadvertently forwards bias and damages the inter nal ESD \nprotection structures. To avoid this damage, use a series 1 kΩ resistor to limit the current flowing into the control \npin. Use pull- up or pull -down resistors if the controller \noutput is in a high impedance state after VDD is powered up and the cont rol pins are not driven to a valid logic state.  \n4. Apply an RF input signal to either the RFC port or the RF \nthrow port.  \nThe ideal power -down  sequence is the reverse order of the \npower -up sequence . \nTable 5.

Evaluation Board Cross Sectional View  \nAll RF and dc traces are routed on the top copper layer, whereas \nthe inner and bottom layers are grounded planes that provide a \nsolid ground for the RF transmission lines. The top dielectric material is 8 mil Rogers RO4003, offering optimal high frequency \nperformance. The middle and bottom dielectric materials provide \nmechanical strength. The overall board thickness is 62 mil, which \nallows 2.4 mm RF launchers to be connected at the board edges. \nFigure 24 shows the top view of the evaluation board. \n16765-024 \nFigure 24.

The RF transmission lines are extended by 8 mil from \npackage edge to the tapered line used for RF pin transition as \nshown in Figure 25. For optimal RF and thermal grounding, as \nmany plated through vias as possible are arranged around transmission lines and under the exposed pad of the package. \n16765-025\n \nFigure 25.

Additionally, unpopulated components positions are available for applying extra bypass capacitors. \nOn the control traces, there are provisions for the resistor capacitor \n(RC) filter to eliminate dc-coupled noise, if needed, by the \napplication. The resistor can also improve the isolation between the RF and the control signal. \nThe RF input and output ports (RFC, RF1 to RF4) are connected \nthrough 50 Ω transmission lines to the 2.4 mm RF launchers. \nThese high frequency RF launchers are by contact and not \nsoldered onto the board.  \nA thru calibration line (THRU CAL) connects the unpopulated \nRF launchers. This transmission line is used to calibrate out the \nboard loss effects from the ADRF5047-EV ALZ  evaluation board \nmeasurements to determine the device performance at the pins of the IC.
