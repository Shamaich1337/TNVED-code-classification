Its input common mode range includes \nground, so that a ground-referenced input signal can be \nDC-coupled, level-shifted, and converted to drive an ADC differentially.\nThe gain and feedback resistors are external, so that the \nexact gain and frequency response can be tailored to each \napplication. For example, the amplifier could be externally \ncompensated in a no-overshoot configuration, which is \ndesired in certain time-domain applications.\nThe LTC6409  is stable in a differential gain of 1. This \nallows for a low output noise in applications where gain is not desired. It draws 52mA of supply current and has \na hardware shutdown feature which reduces current con -\nsumption to 100µA.\nThe LTC6409 is available in a compact 3mm × 2mm  \n10-pin leadless QFN package and operates over a –40°C \nto 125°C temperature range.\nL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks of \nAnalog\xa0Devices, Inc.

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: Input pins (+IN, –IN, V\nOCM, and SHDN) are protected by steering \ndiodes to either supply. If the inputs should exceed either supply voltage, \nthe input current should be limited to less than 10mA. In addition, the inputs +IN, –IN are protected by a pair of back-to-back diodes. If the differential input voltage exceeds 1.4V, the input current should be limited to less than 10mA.\nNote 3: A heat sink may be required to keep the junction temperature \nbelow the absolute maximum rating when the output is shorted indefinitely.Note 4: The LTC6409C/LTC6409I are guaranteed functional over the temperature range of –40°C to 85°C. The LTC6409H is guaranteed functional over the temperature range of –40°C to 125°C.\nNote 5: The LTC6409C is guaranteed to meet specified performance from \n0°C to 70°C.

Output CMRR is defined as the ratio of the change in the voltage at the V\nOCM pin to the change in differential \ninput referred offset voltage. This specification is strongly dependent on feedback ratio matching between the two outputs and their respective inputs and it is difficult to measure actual amplifier performance (See Effects of Resistor Pair Mismatch in the Applications Information section of this data sheet). For a better indicator of actual amplifier performance independent of feedback component matching, refer to the PSRR specification.\nNote 9: Differential power supply rejection (PSRR) is defined as the ratio \nof the change in supply voltage to the change in differential input referred offset voltage. Common mode power supply rejection (PSRRCM) is defined as the ratio of the change in supply voltage to the change in the output common mode offset voltage.\nNote 10: Supply voltage range is guaranteed by power supply rejection \nratio test.\nNote 11: Extended operation with the output shorted may cause the \njunction temperature to exceed the 150°C limit.\nNote 12: Refer to Relationship Between

The amplifier is \noptimized to drive low voltage, single-supply, differential \ninput analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The LTC6409 \ninput common mode range includes ground, which makes \nit ideal to DC-couple and convert ground-referenced, \nsingle-ended signals into differential signals that are ref -\nerenced to the user-supplied output common mode volt -\nage. This is ideal for driving these differential ADCs. The balanced differential nature of the amplifier also provides \neven-order harmonic distortion cancellation, and low \nsusceptibility to common mode noise (like power sup -\nply noise). The LTC6409 can operate with a single-ended input and differential output, or with a differential input and differential output.\nThe outputs of the LTC6409 are capable of swinging from \nclose-to-ground to 1V below V+. They can source or sink \nup to approximately 70mA of current. Load capacitances \nshould be decoupled with at least 10Ω  of series resistance \nfrom each output.\nInput Pin Protection\nThe LTC6409 input stage is protected against differential \ninput voltages which exceed 1.4V by two pairs of series \ndiodes connected back to back between +IN and – IN. Moreover , the input pins, as well as V OCM and SHDN  \npins, have clamping diodes to either power supply. If \nthese pins are driven to voltages which exceed either \nsupply, the current should be limited to 10mA to prevent \ndamage to the IC.\nSHDN Pin\nThe SHDN pin is a CMOS logic input with a 150k inter -\nnal pull-up resistor . If the pin is driven low, the LTC6409 \npowers down. If the pin is left unconnected or driven \nhigh, the part is in normal active operation. Some care \nshould be taken to control leakage currents at this pin to \nprevent inadvertently putting the LTC6409 into shutdown. \nThe turn-on and turn-off time between the shutdown and \nactive states is typically less than 200ns.\nGeneral Amplifier Applications\nIn Figure 1, the gain to V OUTDIFF  from V INP and V INM is \ngiven by:\n  VOUTDIFF =V+OUT – V–OUT ≈RF\nRI• VINP– VINM ( )\n (1)\nNote from Equation (1), the differential output voltage \n(V+OUT – V –OUT) is completely independent of input and \noutput common mode voltages, or the voltage at the com -\nmon mode pin.

The input common \nmode range at the op amp inputs depends on the circuit \nconfiguration (gain), V OCM and V CM (refer to Figure 1). For \nfully differential input applications, where V INP = –V INM, \nthe common mode input is approximately:\n  VICM=V+IN+V–IN\n2≈VOCM•RI\nRI+RF+VCM•RF\nRI+RF\nWith single-ended inputs, there is an input signal compo -\nnent to the input common mode voltage. Applying only \nVINP (setting V INM to zero), the input common mode volt-\nage is approximately:\n  VICM=V+IN+V–IN\n2≈VOCM•RI\nRI+RF+\nVCM•RF\nRI+RF+VINP\n2•RF\nRI+RF (2)\nThis means that if, for example, the input signal (V INP) \nis a sine, an attenuated version of that sine signal also \nappears at the op amp inputs.\nInput Impedance and Loading Effects\nThe low frequency input impedance looking into the V INP \nor V INM input of Figure 1 depends on how the inputs are \ndriven. For fully differential input sources (V INP = –V INM), \nthe input impedance seen at either input is simply:\n RINP = R INM = R I\nFor single-ended inputs, because of the signal imbalance \nat the input, the input impedance actually increases over the balanced differential case. The input impedance look -\ning into either input is:\n  RINP=RINM=RI\n1–1\n2•RF\nRI+RF\nInput signal sources with non-zero output impedances \ncan also cause feedback imbalance between the pair of feedback networks. For the best performance, it is rec -\nommended that the input source output impedance be \ncompensated. If input impedance matching is required Figure 1.

The \nVOCM pin can be overdriven to another voltage if desired. \nFor example, when driving an ADC, if the ADC makes a \nreference available for setting the common mode voltage, \nit can be directly tied to the V OCM pin, as long as the ADC \nis capable of driving the 40k input resistance presented \nby the V OCM pin. The Electrical Characteristics table speci -\nfies the valid range that can be applied to the V OCM pin \n(VOUTCMR ).\nInput Common Mode Voltage Range\nThe LTC6409’ s input common mode voltage (V ICM) is \ndefined as the average of the two input pins, V +IN and \nV–IN. The valid range that can be used for V ICM has been \nspecified in the Electrical Characteristics table (V ICMR). \nHowever , due to external resistive divider action of the \ngain and feedback resistors, the effective range of signals \nLTC640911\n6409fb For more information www.linear.com/LTC6409APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nby the source, a termination resistor R T should be chosen \n(see Figure 2) such that:\n  RT=RINM•RS\nRINM– RS\nAccording to Figure 2, the input impedance looking into \nthe differential amp (R INM) reflects the single-ended \nsource case, given above. Also, R2 is chosen as:\n  R2=RT||RS=RT•RS\nRT+RS\nFigure 2.

Setting the differential \ninput to zero (V INDIFF  = 0), the degree of common mode \nto differential conversion is given by the equation:\n  VOUTDIFF =V+OUT – V–OUT ≈(VCM– VOCM) •∆b\nbAVG (3)\nIn general, the degree of feedback pair mismatch is a source of common mode to differential conversion of \nboth signals and noise. Using 0.1% resistors or better \nwill mitigate most problems and will provide about 54dB worst case of common mode rejection. A low impedance ground plane should be used as a reference for both the input signal source and the V\nOCM pin.\nThere may be concern on how feedback factor mismatch affects distortion.

In addition to the noise generated by the \namplifier , the surrounding feedback resistors also contrib -\nute noise. A simplified noise model is shown in Figure 4. \nThe output noise generated by both the amplifier and the feedback components is given by the equation:\n  eno=eni• 1+RF\nRI\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa2\n+2 • i n•RF ( )2+\n2 • e nRI•RF\nRI\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f72\n+2 • e nRF2\nIf the circuits surrounding the amplifier are well balanced, \ncommon mode noise (e nVOCM ) of the amplifier does not \nappear in the differential output noise equation given \nabove. A plot of this equation and a plot of the noise \ngenerated by the feedback components for the LTC6409 are shown in Figure 5.\nThe LTC6409’s input referred voltage noise contributes \nthe equivalent noise of a 75Ω resistor . When the feedback \nnetwork is comprised of resistors whose values are larger \nthan this, the output noise is resistor noise and amplifier \ncurrent noise dominant. For feedback networks consist -\ning of resistors with values smaller than 75Ω, the output noise is voltage noise dominant (see Figure 5).Lower resistor values always result in lower noise at the penalty of increased distortion due to increased loading by the feedback network on the output. Higher resistor \nvalues will result in higher output noise, but typically \nimproved distortion due to less loading on the output. \nFor this reason, when LTC6409 is configured in a differ -\nential gain of 1, using feedback resistors of at least 150Ω  \nis recommended.\nTo calculate noise figure (NF), a source resistance and the \nnoise it generates should also come into consideration. \nFigure 6 shows a noise model for the amplifier which includes the source resistance (R\nS).

The circuits \nin the left column use termination resistors and trans -\nformers to match to the 50Ω source resistance, while the \ncircuits in the right column do not have such matching. For simplicity, DC-blocking and bypass capacitors have not been shown in the circuits, as they do not affect the noise results.\nRelationship Between Different Linearity Metrics\nLinearity is, of course, an important consideration in many \namplifier applications. This section relates the inter-mod -\nulation distortion of fully differential amplifiers to other \nlinearity metrics commonly used in RF style blocks.\nIntercept points are specifications that have long been \nused as key design criteria in the RF communications \nworld as a metric for the intermodulation distortion \nperformance of a device in the signal chain (e.g., ampli -\nfiers, mixers, etc.). Intercept points, like noise figures, \ncan be easily cascaded back and forth through a signal \nchain to determine the overall performance of a receiver \nchain, thus resulting in simpler system-level calculations. \nT raditionally, these systems use primarily single-ended RF \namplifiers as gain blocks designed to operate in a 50Ω \nenvironment, just like the rest of the receiver chain. Since \nintercept points are given in dBm, this implies an associ -\nated impedance of 50Ω.\nHowever , for \nLTC6409 as a differential feedback amplifier \nwith low output impedance, a 50Ω resistive load is not \nrequired (unlike an RF amplifier). This distinction is impor -\ntant when evaluating the intercept point for LTC6409. In \nfact, the LTC6409 yields optimum distortion performance \nwhen loaded with 200Ω to 1kΩ (at each output), very \nsimilar to the input impedance of an ADC. As a result, \nterminating the input of the ADC to 50Ω can actually be \ndetrimental to system performance.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 6.

Definition of IMD3\nFigure 9. Graphical Representation of the \nRelationship between IMD3 and OIP3\namplifier , implying that each single tone is 1V P-P, result-\ning in V PDIFF = 0.5V. Using R L = 50Ω as the associated \nimpedance, P O is calculated to be close to 4dBm.\nAs seen in Equation (5), when a higher impedance is used, \nthe same level of intermodulation distortion performance results in a lower intercept point. Therefore, it is impor -\ntant to consider the impedance seen by the output of the \nLTC6409 when working with inter\ncept points.\nComparing linearity specifications between different \namplifier types becomes easier when a common imped-\nance level is assumed. For this reason, the intercept \npoints for LTC6409 are reported normalized to a 50Ω  \nload impedance. This is the reason why OIP3 in the \nElectrical Characteristics table is 4dBm more than half the absolute value of IMD3.\nIf the top half of the LTC6409 demo board (DC1591A, \nshown in Figure 12) is used to measure IMD3 and OIP3, \none should make sure to properly convert the power seen \nat the differential output of the amplifier to the power that \nappears at the single-ended output of the demo board. \nFigure 10 shows an equivalent representation of the top \nhalf of the demo board. This view ignores the DC-blocking \nand bypass capacitors, which do not affect the analysis \nhere. The transmission line transformers (used mainly \nfor impedance matching) are modeled here as ideal 4:1 \nimpedance transformers together with a –1dB  block. This \nseparates the insertion loss of the transformer from its \nideal behavior . The 100Ω resistors at the LTC6409 output \ncreate a differential 200Ω resistance, which is an imped -\nance match for the reflected R L.\nAs previously mentioned, IMD3  is measured for 2V P-P dif-\nferential peak (i.e. 10dBm) at the output of the LTC6409, corresponding to 1V\nP-P (i.e. 4dBm) at each output alone. \nFrom LTC6409 output (location A in Figure 10) to the \ninput of the output transformer (location B), there is a voltage attenuation of 1/2 (or –6dB) formed by the \nFigure 10.

This means that IMD3  \nshould be measured while the power at the output of the \ndemo board is – 3dBm which is equivalent to having 2V P-P \ndifferential peak (or 10dBm) at the output of the LTC6409.\nGBW vs f –3dB\nGain-bandwidth product (GBW) and – 3dB frequency \n(f–3dB) have been both specified in the Electrical \nCharacteristics table as two different metrics for the speed \nof the LTC6409. GBW is obtained by measuring the gain \nof the amplifier at a specific frequency (f TEST) and cal -\nculate gain • f TEST. To measure gain, the feedback factor \n(i.e. b \n= RI/(RI + R F)) is chosen sufficiently small so that \nthe feedback loop does not limit the available gain of the LTC6409 at f\nTEST, ensuring that the measured gain is the \nopen loop gain of the amplifier . As long as this condition \nis met, GBW is a parameter that depends only on the \ninternal design and compensation of the amplifier and is a suitable metric to specify the inherent speed capability of the amplifier .\nf\n–3dB, on the other hand, is a parameter of more practi -\ncal interest in different applications and is by definition \nthe frequency at which the gain is 3dB\n lower than its low \nfrequency value. The value of f –3dB depends on the speed \nof the amplifier as well as the feedback factor . Since the LTC6409 is designed to be stable in a differential signal gain of 1 (where R\nI = R F or b = 1/2), the maximum f –3dB \nis obtained and measured in this gain setting, as reported \nin the Electrical Characteristics table. \nIn most amplifiers, the open loop gain response exhibits a \nconventional single-pole roll-off for most of the frequen -\ncies before crossover frequency and the GBW and f –3dB \nnumbers are close to each other . However , the LTC6409 is intentionally compensated in such a way that its GBW \nis significantly larger than its f –3dB. This means that at lower frequencies (where the input signal frequencies \ntypically lie, e.g. 100MHz) the amplifier’s gain and thus the feedback loop gain is larger . This has the important advantage of further linearizing the amplifier and improv -\ning distortion at those frequencies.\nLooking at the Frequency \nResponse vs Closed Loop Gain \ngraph in the Typical Performance Characteristics section \nof this data sheet, one sees that for a closed loop gain (A\nV) of 1 (where R I = R F = 150Ω), f –3dB is about 2GHz. \nHowever , for A V = 400 (where R I = 25Ω and R F = 10kΩ), \nthe gain at 100MHz is close to 40dB = 100V/V , implying a GBW value of 10GHz.\nFeedback Capacitors\nWhen the LTC6409 is configured in low differential gains, \nit is often advantageous to utilize a feedback capacitor (C F) \nin parallel with each feedback resistor (R F). The use of C F \nimplements a pole-zero pair (in which the zero frequency \nis usually smaller than the pole frequency) and adds posi -\ntive phase to the feedback loop gain around the amplifier . \nTherefore, if properly chosen, the addition of C F boosts \nthe phase margin and improves the stability response of the feedback loop. For example, with R\nI = RF = 150Ω, it is \nrecommended for most general applications to use C F = \n1.3pF across each R F. This value has been selected to \nmaximize f –3dB for the LTC6409 while keeping the peaking \nof the closed loop gain versus frequency response under a reasonable level (<1dB). It also results in the highest frequency for 0.1dB gain flatness (f\n0.1dB).\nHowever , other values of C F can also be utilized and tailored \nto other specific applications. In general, a larger value for C\nF reduces the peaking (overshoot) of the amplifier in \nboth frequency and time domains, but also decreases the \nclosed loop bandwidth (f –3dB). For example, while for a \nclosed loop gain (A V) of 5, C F = 0.8pF results in maximum \nf–3dB (as previously shown in the Frequency Response vs \nClosed Loop Gain graph of this data sheet), if C F = 1.2pF \nis used, the amplifier exhibits no overshoot in the time \ndomain which is desirable in certain applications. Both the \ncircuits discussed in this section have been shown in the Typical Applications section of this data sheet.\nLTC640917\n6409fb For more information www.linear.com/LTC6409APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nBoard Layout and Bypass Capacitors\nFor single supply applications, it is recommended that \nhigh quality 0.1µF||1000pF ceramic bypass capacitors \nbe placed directly between each V+ pin and its closest \nV– pin with short connections. The V– pins (including the \nExposed Pad) should be tied directly to a low impedance \nground plane with minimal routing.\nFor dual (split) power supplies, it is recommended that \nadditional high quality 0.1µF||1000pF ceramic capaci -\ntors be used to bypass V+ pins to ground and V– pins to \nground, again with minimal routing.\nFor driving heavy differential loads ( <200Ω), additional \nbypass capacitance may be needed for optimal perfor -\nmance. Keep in mind that small geometry (e.g., 0603) \nsurface mount ceramic capacitors have a much higher \nself-resonant frequency than do leaded capacitors, and \nperform best in high speed applications.To prevent degradation in stability response, it is highly \nrecommended that any stray capacitance at the input \npins, +IN and –IN, be kept to an absolute minimum by \nkeeping printed circuit connections as short as possible. \nThis becomes especially true when the feedback resistor \nnetwork uses resistor values greater than 500Ω in circuits \nwith R I = R F.\nAt the output, always keep in mind the differential nature of the LTC6409, because it is critical that the load imped -\nances seen by both outputs (stray or intended), be as bal -\nanced and symmetric as possible. This will help preserve \nthe balanced operation of the LTC6409 that minimizes the \ngeneration of even-order harmonics and maximizes the rejection of common mode signals and noise.\nThe V OCM pin should be bypassed to the ground plane \nwith a high quality ceramic capacitor of at least 0.01µF. \nThis will prevent common mode signals and noise on this \npin from being inadvertently converted to differential sig -\nnals and noise by impedance mismatches both externally \nand internally to the IC.Driving ADCs\nThe LTC6409’s ground-referenced input, differential out -\nput and adjustable output common mode voltage make \nit ideal for interfacing to differential input ADCs. These \nADCs are typically supplied from a single-supply voltage \nand have an optimal common mode input range near mid-\nsupply. The LTC6409 interfaces to these ADCs by provid -\ning single-ended to differential conversion and common \nmode level shifting.\nThe sampling process of ADCs creates a transient that is \ncaused by the switching in of the ADC sampling capaci -\ntor . This momentarily shorts the output of the amplifier as charge is transferred \nbetween amplifier and sampling \ncapacitor . The amplifier must recover and settle from this \nload transient before the acquisition period has ended, for \na valid representation of the input signal. The LTC6409 will settle quickly from these periodic load impulses. The \nRC network between the outputs of the driver and the \ninputs of the ADC decouples the sampling transient of \nthe ADC (see Figure 11). The capacitance serves to pro -\nvide the bulk of the charge during the sampling process, \nwhile the two resistors at the outputs of the LTC6409  \nare used to dampen and attenuate any charge injected \nby the ADC. The RC filter gives the additional benefit of band limiting broadband output noise. Generally, longer \ntime constants improve SNR at the expense of settling \ntime. The resistors in the decoupling network should be at least 10Ω. These resistors also serve to decouple the LTC6409 outputs from load capacitance. Too large of a resistor will leave insufficient settling time. Too small of a resistor will not properly dampen the load transient of the sampling process, prolonging the time required for settling. In 16\n-bit applications, this will typically require \na minimum of eleven RC time constants. For lowest dis -\ntortion, choose capacitors with low dielectric absorption (such as a C0G multilayer ceramic capacitor).\nLTC640918\n6409fb For more information www.linear.com/LTC6409–+3SHDN\n6–IN\n7+OUT2+IN1–OUT\nAIN+\nAIN–150/uni03A9\n4V+\nV+\nV+5V\nVOCMVOCM10V–\n8V–V–\nV–\n6409 F11L TC6409\nADCL TC2262-14VIN\nSHDN\n150/uni03A9 150/uni03A9100/uni03A9150/uni03A9\n0.1µF\n33.2/uni03A933.2/uni03A9\n10/uni03A9\n10/uni03A95V\n50.1µF||1000pF0.1µF||1000pFCONTROL\nGND VDD VCMD13\n\x7f\n\x7f\nD0\n0.1µF||1000pF39pF\n39pF1.8V\n1µF1.3pF\n1.3pF1µF9V+APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 11.
