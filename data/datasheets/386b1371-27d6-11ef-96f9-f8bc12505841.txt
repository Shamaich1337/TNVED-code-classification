Circuitry Design\n1.1 Useful life\nThe FC Series Supercapacitor (EDLC) uses an electrolyte in a sealed container. Water in the electrolyte can evaporate \nwhile in use over long periods of time at high temperatures, thus reducing electrostatic capacity which in turn will create \ngreater internal resistance. The characteristics of the supercapacitor can vary greatly depending on the environment in \nwhich it is used. Basic breakdown mode is an open mode due to increased internal resistance.\n1.2\tFail\trate\tin\tthe\tfield\nBased\ton\tfield\tdata,\tthe\tfail\trate\tis\tcalculated\tat\tapproximately\t0.006\tFit.\tWe\testimate\tthat\tunreported\tfailures\tare\tten\t\ntimes this amount. Therefore, we assume that the fail rate is below 0.06 Fit.\n1.3 Exceeding maximum usable voltage\nPerformance may be compromised and in some cases leakage or damage may occur if applied voltage exceeds \nmaximum working voltage.\n1.4 Use of capacitor as a smoothing capacitor (ripple absorption)\nAs supercapacitors contain a high level of internal resistance, they are not recommended for use as smoothing \ncapacitors in electrical circuits. Performance may be compromised and, in some cases, leakage or damage may occur if \na supercapacitor is used in ripple absorption.\n1.5 Series connections\nAs applied voltage balance to each supercapacitor is lost when used in series connection, excess voltage may be \napplied to some supercapacitors, which will not only negatively affect its performance but may also cause leakage \nand/or damage. Allow ample margin for maximum voltage or attach a circuit for applying equal voltage to each \nsupercapacitor (partial pressure resistor/voltage divider) when using supercapacitors in series connection. Also, \narrange supercapacitors so that the temperature between each capacitor will not vary.\n1.6 Case Polarity\nThe supercapacitor is manufactured so that the terminal on the outer case is negative (-). Align the (-) symbol during \nuse. Even though discharging has been carried out prior to shipping, any residual electrical charge may negatively affect \nother parts.\n1.7 Use next to heat emitters\nUseful\tlife\tof\tthe\tsupercapacitor\twill\tbe\tsignificantly\taffected\tif\tused\tnear\theat\temitting\titems\t(coils,\tpower\ttransistors\t\nand posistors, etc.) where the supercapacitor itself may become heated.\n1.8 Usage environment \nThis device cannot be used in any acidic, alkaline or similar type of environment.\n11 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • One East Broward Boulevard S6014_FT • 8/10/2023\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nSupercapacitors – FT SeriesNotes on Using Supercapacitors or Electric Double-Layer Capacitors (EDLCs) cont.\n2.
