B | Page 9 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADT7301 is a 13- bit digital temperature sensor with a 14th \nbit that acts as a sign bit. The part houses an on -chip temperature  \nsensor, a 13 -bit A/D converter, a reference circuit , and serial \ninterface logic functions in SOT -23 and M SOP packages. The \nADC section consis ts of a conventional successive approximation  \nconverter based around a capacitor DAC. The par ts run  on a \n2.7 V to 5.25 V power supply.  \nThe on -chip temperature sensor allows an accurate measure-\nment of the ambient device temperature to be made. The \nspecified measurement range of the ADT7301 is − 40°C to \n+150° C. Greater than 125°C, the A DT7301 is limited to 5%  \nof its 55° C operational lifetime. The structural integrity of the \ndevice may start to deteriorate when  continuously  operated at \nabsolute maximum voltage and temperature specifications.  \nCONV ERTER DETAILS  \nThe conversion clock for the part is internally generated . No \nexternal clock is required except when reading from and writing to the serial port. In normal mode, an internal clock oscillator runs an automatic conversion sequence. During this automatic conversion sequence, a conversion is initiated every 1 .5 second. \nAt this time, the part powers up its analog circuitry and performs a temperature conversion. This temperatur e conversion typically \ntakes 1.2 m s, after which  the analog circuitry of the part auto -\nmatically shuts down. The analog circuitry powers up again when the 1.5 second timer times out and the next conversion begins. \nSince the serial interface circuitry never shuts down , the result \nof the most recent temperature conversion is alwa ys available in \nthe serial output register . The ADT7301 can be placed in to shutdown mode via the control \nregister . This means that  the on -chip oscillator is shut down and \nno further conversions are initiated until the ADT7301  is taken \nout of shutdown mode . The ADT7301 can be taken out of \nshutdown mode by writing all 0 s into the control register. The \nconversion result from the last conversion prior to shutdown can still be read from the ADT7301 even when it is in shutdown mode.  \nIn normal conversion mode, th e internal clock oscillator is reset \nafter every read or write operation. This causes the device to start a temperature conversion , the result  of which is typically  available \n1.2 m s later. Similarly, when the part is taken out of shutdown \nmode, the interna l clock oscillator is started and a conversion is \ninitiated. The co nversion result i s available 1.2 m s later. Every \nresult  is stored in a buffer register and is loaded into the \ntemperature value regis ter only at the first falling SCLK edge  of \nevery serial port activity.  Serial port activity does not interfere \nwith conversion process es, and every  conversio n is completed, \neven during a read operation . A conversion has to be completed \nbefore a read occurs, otherwise it s result is not  loaded into  the \ntemperatur e value register  and instead is loaded  into the buffer \nregister. A new conversion is triggered at the end of each serial \nport activity , except when a conversion is already in progress.  \nADT7301   \n \nRev. B | Page 10 of 16 TEMPERATURE  VALUE  REGISTER  \nThe temperature value register is a 14 -bit read- only register that \nstores the temperature reading from the ADC in 13 -bit twos \ncomplement format plus a sign bit. The MSB (DB13) is the sign \nbit. The ADC can theoretically measure a 255° C temperature \nspan . The internal temperature sensor is guaranteed t o a low \nvalue limit of − 40°C and a high limit of +150 °C. The temperature \ndata format is shown in Table 5 , which shows the temperature \nmeasurement range of the device ( −40°C to +150° C).

Serial Interface Timing Diagram   \n \nSERIAL INTERFACE  \nThe serial interface on the ADT7301 consists of four wires :  \nCS, SCLK, DIN , and DOUT. Th e interface can be operated in  \n3-wire mode with DIN tied to ground, in which case the inter -\nface has read- only capability, with data being read from the data \nregister via th e DOUT  line. It is advisable to always use CS to \ncreate a communications window , as shown  in Figure 14; this \nimprove s synchronization between the ADT7301 and the master  \ndevice. The DIN line is used to write the part into standby mode,  \nif required. The  CS line is used to select the device when more \nthan one device is connected to the serial clock and data lines. \nThe part operates in a slave mode and requires an externally applied serial clock to th e SCLK input to access data from the \ndata register. The serial interface on the ADT7301 allow s the \npart to be interfaced to systems that provide a serial clock synchronized to the serial data, such as the 80C51, 87C51, \n68HC11, 68HC05, and PIC16Cxx microcon trollers as well as \nDSP processors.  \nA read operation from the ADT7301 accesses data from the \ntemperature value register, while a write operation to the part \nwrites data to the c ontrol register. Read Operation  \nFigure 14 shows the t iming diagram for a serial read from the \nADT7301. The CS line enables the SCLK input. Thirteen bits of \ndata plus a sign bit are transferred during a read operation. Read operations occur during streams of 16 clock pulses. The first 2 bits out are leading zeros and the next 14 bits contain the \ntemperature data. If CS\n remains low and 16 more SCLK cycles \nare applied, the ADT7301 loops around and outputs the two \nleading zeros plus the 14 bits of data that are in the temp -\nerature value register. When CS returns high, the DOUT line \ngoes into three -state. Data is clocked out onto the DOUT line \non the falling edge of SCLK.  \nWrite Operation  \nFigure 14 also shows the timing diagram for a seri al write to the \nADT7301. The write operation takes place at the same time as the read operation. Only the third bit in the data stream provides a user -controlled  function. This third bit is the power -down bit , \nwhich, when set to 1, puts the ADT 7301 into sh utdown mode. \nIn addition to  the power -down bit , all bits in the input data \nstream should be 0  to ensure correct operation of the ADT7301. \nData is loaded into the c ontrol register on the 16\nth rising SCLK \nedge ; the data takes effect at this time . Therefore, if the part is \nprogrammed to go into shutdown, it does so at this point. If CS \nis brought high before this 16th SCLK edge, the c ontrol register \nis not loaded and the power -down status of the part does not \nchange. Data is clocked into the ADT7301 on the rising edge  \nof SCLK.  \n \nADT7301   \n \nRev.

Figure 15 to Figure  18 \nshow some typical interface circuits. The serial interface on the \nADT7301 consists of four wires: CS, DIN, DOUT , and SCLK. \nAll interface circuits shown us e all four interface lines. However,  \nit is possible to operate the interface with three wires. If the \napplication does not require the power -down facility offered  \nby the ADT7301, the DIN line can be tied low  permanently . \nThus, the interface can be operated from just three wires : SCLK, \nCS, and DOUT.  \nThe serial data t ransfer to and from the ADT7301 requires a  \n16-bit read operation. Many 8 -bit microcontrollers have 8 -bit \nserial ports , and this 16 -bit data transfer is handled as two 8 -bit \ntrans fers. Other microcontrollers and DSP processors transfer \n16 bits of data in a serial data operation.  \nADT7301- to-MC68HC11 Interface  \nFigure 15 shows an interface circuit between the ADT7301 and \nthe MC68HC11 microcontroller. The MC68HC11 is configured \nin master mode with its CPOL and CPHA bit s set to a Logic 1. \nWhen the MC68HC11 is configured like this, its SCLK line idles  \nhigh between data transfers. Data is transferred to and from the ADT7301 in two 8- bit serial data operations. Figure 15\n shows \nthe full ( 4-wire) interface. PC1 of the  MC68HC11 is configured \nas an output and is used to drive the CS input.   \nADT7301*\nSCLK\nDOUT\nDINMC68HC11*\nSCLK\nMISO\nMOSI\nPC1\n02884-0-008\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYCS\n \nFigure 15. ADT730 1-to- MC68HC11 Interface  \nADT7301- to-8051 Interface  \nFigure 16 shows a n interface circuit between the ADT7301 and \nthe microcon troller . The 8051 is configured in its Mode 0 serial \ninterface  mode. The serial clock line of the 8051 (on P3.1) idles \nhigh between data transfers. Data is transferred to and from the ADT7301 in two 8- bit serial d ata operations. The ADT7301 \noutputs the MSB of its data stream as the first valid bit while the 8051 expects the LSB first. Thus, the data read into the serial \nbuffer needs to be rearranged before the correct data -word  from \nthe ADT7301 is available in the accumulator.  In the example shown in Figure 16, the ADT7301 is connected \nto the serial port of the 8051. Because the serial interface of the 8051 contains only one data line, the DIN line of the ADT7301 \nis tied lo w in Figure 16. \nFor applications that require the ADT7301 power -down feature, \nthe serial interface should be implemented using data port lines on the 8051. This allows a full- duplex serial interface to be \nimplemented. The method invo lves generating a serial clock on \none port line  while using two ot her port lines to shift data  \nin and out with the fourth port line connecting to CS\n. Port  \nlines 1.0 t o 1.3 (with P1.1 configured as an input) can be used  \nto connect to SCLK, DOUT, DIN , and CS, respectively, to \nimplement this scheme.  \nADT7301*\n02884-0-009SCLK\nDOUT\nDIN8051*\nP3.1\nP3.0P1.2P1.3\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYCS\n \nFigure 16.

ADT7301 -to- ADSP -21xx  Interface  MOUNTING  THE ADT7301  \nThe ADT7301 can be used for surface  or air  temperature \nsensing applications. If the device is cemented to a surface with a thermally conductive adhesive, the die temperature will be \nwithin about 0.1 °C of the surface temperature because of  the \nADT7301’s low power consumption. Care should be taken to \ninsulate the back and leads of the device if the ambient air \ntemperature is different from the surface temperature being \nmeasured.  \nThe ground pin provides t he best thermal path to the die; \ntherefore , the temperature of the die is  close to that of the \nprinted  circuit ground track. Care should be taken to ensure \nthat this is in good thermal contact with the measured surface. \nAs in any IC, the ADT7301 and its associated wiring and \ncircuits must be kept free from moisture to prevent leakage and \ncorrosion, particu larly in cold conditions where condensation is \nmore likely to occur. Water -resistant varnishes and conformal \ncoatings can be used for protection. The small size of the ADT7301 allows it to be mounted inside sealed metal probes, which provide a safe environment for the device.  \nSUPPLY DECOUPLING  \nThe ADT7301 should be decoupled with a 0.1 µF ceramic \ncapacitor between VDD and GND. This is particul arly important \nif the ADT7301 mount is  remote from the power supply.  \n \n \n ADT7301  \n \nRev.
