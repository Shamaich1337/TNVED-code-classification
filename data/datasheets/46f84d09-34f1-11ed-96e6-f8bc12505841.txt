**Description:**
The NLSV4T244 is a dual-supply, non-inverting level translator designed for 4-bit configurable voltage level translation. It allows for interfacing between devices operating at different voltage levels, making it suitable for low-voltage applications. The device can operate with supply voltages ranging from 0.9 V to 4.5 V, enabling universal low-voltage translation.

**Typical Applications:**
The NLSV4T244 is commonly used in:
- Mobile phones
- Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)
- Other portable devices that require voltage level shifting between different power supply rails. 
- It is particularly useful in applications where devices with different voltage levels need to communicate, such as interfacing between microcontrollers and sensors or other digital logic devices.
