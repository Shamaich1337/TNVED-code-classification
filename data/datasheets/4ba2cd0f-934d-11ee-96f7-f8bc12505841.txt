It \nuses two separate configurable power -supply rails, with the \nA ports supporting operatin g voltages from 1.65V to 5.5V \nwhile it tracks the V CCA supply, and the B ports supporting \noperating voltages from 2.3V to 5.5V while it tracks the V CCB \nsupply . This allows the support of  both lower and higher \nlogic signal levels while providing  bidirection al translation \ncapabilities between any of the  1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V  and 5V \nvoltage nodes.  \n \nWhen the output -enable (OE) input is low, all I/Os  are \nplaced in the high -impedance state, which significantly \nreduces the power -supply quiescent current consumption.  \nOE has an internal pull -down current source, as long as \nVCCA is powered.  \n \nTo ensure the high -impedance state during power up or \npower down,  OE should be tied to GND through a pull - \ndown resistor; the minimum value of the resistor is   \ndetermined by the current -sourcing capability of the  driver.  \n \nThe RS 0104 is available in Green QFN3.5x3.5 -14L, \nQFN2x2 -12L and TSSOP -14 packages . It operates over an \nambient temperature range of -40° C to + 85° C. \n \n \n \n  \nRS010 4 \n \n  2 / 23 www. run-ic.com \n   \n \nFunctional Block Diagram  \n \n \n \n Figure 1.Block Diagram\n \n \n \n  \n  \nRS010 4 \n \n  3 / 23 www. run-ic.com \n   \n \nRevision History  \nNote: Page numbers for previous revisions may different from page numbers in the current version.  \n \nVERSION  Change Date  Change Item  \nA.1 2020/11/03  Initial version completed  \nA.2 2021/01/09  Add Moisture Sensitivity Level  information  \n \n  \n  \nRS010 4 \n \n  4 / 23 www. run-ic.com \n   \n \nPIN CONFIGURATIONS  \n1 14\n7 8GND\nOEVCCA\nVCCB\nA1\nA2\nNCB1\nQFN3.5x3.5 -14L(TOP VIEW)\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6A3\nA4\n910111213\nNCB4B3B2\n \nPIN DESCRIPTION  \nPIN \nNAME  TYPE (1) FUNCTION  QFN3.5x3.5 -\n14L \n1 VCCA P A Port Supply Voltage.1.65V ≤ V CCA ≤ 5.5V and V CCA ≤ V CCB. \n2 A1 I/O Input/output A1.

The A port is able to accept I/O voltages ranging from 1.65 V to 5.5 V, while the B port can accept I/O  \nvoltages from 2.3 V to 5.5 V. The device is a pass -gate architecture with edge -rate accelerators (one -shots) to  \nimprove the overall data rate. 10 -kΩ pullup resistors, commonly used in open -drain applications, have been  \nconveniently integrated so that an external resistor is not needed. While this device is designed for open -drain  \napplications, the device can also translate push -pull CMOS logic outputs.  \n \nArchitecture  \nThe RS010 4 architecture (see Figure 8) is an auto -direction -sensing based translator that does not require a  \ndirection -control signal to control the direction of data flow from A to B or from B to A.  These two bidirectional \nchannels independently determine the direction of data flow without a direction -control  signal. Each I/O pin can \nbe automatically reconfigured as either an input or an output, which is how this auto -direction  feature is realized.  \n \nBGate BiasOne\nshotT2 T1VCCA VCCB\nAGate Bias\nN2One-\nshot\nR1\n10kR2\n10kOne\nshotOne-\nshot\n \n \nFigure 8. Architecture of a RS010 4 Cell \n \nThe RS010 4 employs two key circuits to enable  this voltage translation:  \n1) An N -channel pass -gate transistor topology that ties the A -port to the B -port \n2) Output one -shot (O.S.) edge -rate accelerator circuitry to detect and accelerate rising edges on the A or B  \nPorts. \n \nInput Driver Requirements  \nThe continuous dc -current "sinking" capability is determined by the external system -level open -drain (or push -\npull) drivers that are interfaced to the RS010 4 I/O pins. Since the high bandwidth of these bidirectional I/O  \ncircuits is used to facilitate this fast change from an input to an output and an output to an input, they have a  \nmodest dc -current "sourcing" capability of hundreds of micro -Amps, as determined by the internal 10 -kΩ pullup  \nresistors.  \n \nThe fall time (t fA, tfB) of a signal depends on the edge -rate and output impedance of the external device driving  \nRS010 4 data I/Os, as well as the capacitive loading on the data lines.   \n \nSimilarly, the t PHL and max data rates also depend on the output impedance of the external  driver. The values \nfor tfA, tfB, tPHL, and maximum data rates in the data sheet assume that the output impedance of the external \ndriver is  less than 50 Ω. \n  \n  \nRS010 4 \n \n  19 / 23 www. run-ic.com \n   \n \nFeature Description  \n \nOutput Load Considerations  \nWe recommend careful PCB layout practices with short PCB trace lengths to avoid excessive capacitive loading  \nand to ensure that proper O.S. triggering takes place. PCB signal trace -lengths should be kept short enough  \nsuch that the round -trip delay of any reflection is less than the one -shot duration. T his improves signal integrity  \nby ensuring that any reflection sees a low impedance at the driver. The O.S. circuits have been designed to \nstay on for approximately 30 ns. The maximum capacitance of the lumped load that can be driven also depends  \ndirectly o n the one -shot duration. With very heavy capacitive loads, the one -shot can time -out before the signal \nis driven fully to the positive rail. The O.S. duration has been set to best optimize trade -offs between dynamic \nICC, load driving capability, and maximum bit -rate considerations. Both PCB trace length and connectors add \nto the  capacitance that the RS010 4 device output sees, so it is recommended that this lumped -load capacitance \nbe considered to avoid O.S. retriggering, bus contention, output signal oscillations, or other adverse system -\nlevel affects.  \n \nEnable and Disable  \nThe RS010 4 device has an OE input that is used to disable the device by setting OE low, which places all I/Os  \nin the Hi -Z state. The disable time (t dis) indicates the delay between th e time when OE goes low and when the  \noutputs are disabled (Hi -Z). The enable time (t en) indicates the amount of time the user must allow for the one -\nshot circuitry to become operational after OE is taken high.  \n \nPullup or Pulldown Resistors on I/O Lines  \nEach A -port I/O has an internal 10 -kΩ pullup resistor to V CCA, and each B -port I/O has an internal 10 -kΩ pullup \nresistor to V CCB. If a smaller value of pullup resistor is required, an external resistor must be added from the I/O \nto V CCA or V CCB (in parallel with the internal 10 -kΩ resistors). Adding lower value pull -up resistors will affect V OL \nlevels, however. The internal pull -ups of the RS010 4 are disabled when the OE pin is low.  \n \n \n  \n  \nRS010 4 \n \n  20 / 23 www. run-ic.com \n   \n \nApplication Information  \nThe RS010 4 device can be used to bridge the digital -switching compatibility gap between two voltage nodes to  \nsuccessfully interface logic threshold levels found in electronic systems. It should be used in a point -to-point  \ntopology for interfacing devices or systems operating at different interface voltages with one another. Its primary  \ntarget application use is for interfacing with open -drain drivers on the data I/Os such as I 2C or 1 -wire, where the  \ndata is bidirectional and no control signal is available. Th e device can also be used in applications where a \npush -pull driver is connected to the data I/Os, but the RS0104 might be a better option for such push -pull \napplications.  \n \nTypical Application  \n \nRS01041.8V\nSystem\nController\nDATA\nGND GND GNDA1 B1\nDATA3.3V\nSystem1.8V 3.3V\nVCCA VCCB\nOE\nA2 B20.1μμF 0.1μμF 1μμF 1μμF\n A3\nA4B3\nB4\n \nFigure 9.
