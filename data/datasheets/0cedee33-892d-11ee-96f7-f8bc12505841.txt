Input Reflected Ripple Current Test Setup\n \n \n \nNote: Scope measurements should be made using a BNC \nsocket with a 1µF ceramic capacitor and a 100µF \ntantalum capacitor. Position the oscilloscope probe between 51mm and 76mm (2in and 3in) from the \nmodule \n \nFigure9. Peak-to-Peak Output Ripple Test Setup \n \nDesign Considerations  \nInput filtering  \nThe power module should be connected to a low ac-\nimpedance input source. Highly inductive source \nimpedances can affect the stability of the power module. \nFor the test configuration in Figure8 a 47µF aluminum \nelectrolytic capacitor, mounted close to the power module \nhelps ensure stability of the unit.  \n Safety Considerations \nFor safety-agency approval of the system in which the \npower module is used, the power  module must be installed \nin compliance with the spacing and separation \nrequirements of the end-use safety agency standard, i.e. CAN/CSA-C22.2, No. 60950-1 and IEC60950-1, and also \ncompliance with UL62368-1, CAN/CSA C22.2 No. 62368-1-\n14, EN62368-1 and IEC62368-1, if the system in which the \npower module is to be used must meet safety agency \nrequirements.  \nWhen the input source is SELV circuit, the power module \nmeets SELV (safety extra-low voltage) requirements. If the \ninput source is a hazardous voltage which is greater than 60Vdc and less than or equal to 75Vdc, for the module’s output to meet SELV requirements, all of the following must \nbe met: \n\uf06e The input source must be insulated from the ac mains \nby reinforced or double insulation. \n\uf06e The input terminals of the module are not operator \naccessible. \n\uf06e If the metal baseplate is grounded, one Vi pin and one \nVo pin shall also be grounded. \n\uf06e A SELV reliability test is conducted on the system \nwhere the module is used, in combination with the \nmodule, to ensure that under a single fault, hazardous voltage does not appear at the module’s output. \nWhen installed into a Class II equipment (without \ngrounding), spacing consideration should be given to the \nend-use installation, as the spacing between the module \nand mounting surface have not been evaluated.  \nThe power module has extra-low voltage (ELV) outputs \nwhen all inputs are ELV.  \nThis power module is not internally fused. To achieve \noptimum safety and system protec tion, an input line fuse is \nhighly recommended. The safety agencies require a \nnormal-blow fuse with 8A maximum rating to be installed in the ungrounded lead. A lower rated fuse can be used based \non the maximum inrush transient energy and maximum \ninput current. \nFeature Descriptions  \nRemote On/Off \nThe REM pin is used to turn the power converter remote on \n           \n  \n \n D o c u m e n t  N o .

This power module is negative \nlogic, which turns the module on when the REM pin is at \nlogic low and off when it is at logic high. We also provide \npositive logic remote on/off which turns the module on during \nlogic high and off during logic low.  \nTo turn the power module on and off, the user must supply a \nswitch to control the voltage between the REM pin and -Vin terminal (see Figure10). A logic low is V\nREM = 0 V to 1.2 V.  \nDuring logic high, the maximum V REM voltage generated by \nthe power module is 20V.  \n \nIf not using the remote on/off feature, perform one of the following to turn the converter on: For negative logic, short REM pin to -Vin.  For positive logic, leave REM pin open. \n \nFigure10. Remote On/Off Application Circuit \n \nRemote Sense \nRemote sense minimizes the e ffects of distribution losses \nby regulating the voltage at the remote sense connections. \nThe voltage between the remote sense pins and the output \nterminals must not exceed the output voltage sense range \n(<10%Vo). The voltage between the Vo1 and GND terminals must not exceed the minimum output over-voltage \nprotection value shown in the Feature Specifications table. \nThis limit includes any increa se in voltage due to remote \nsense compensation and output voltage set-point \nadjustment (trim). If not using the remote sense feature to \nregulate the output at the point of load, then connect +S to \nVo1 and -S to GND. \nAlthough the output voltage can be increased by both the remote sense and by the trim, the maximum increase for \nthe output voltage is not the sum of both. The maximum \nincrease is the larger of either the remote sense or the trim. \nThe amount of power delivered by the module is defined as the voltage at the output terminals multiplied by the output \ncurrent. When using remote sense and trim, the output \nvoltage of the module can be increased, which at the same \noutput current would increase the power output of the \nmodule. Circuit are should be taken to ensure that the maximum output power of the module remains at or below \nthe maximum rated power. \n \n \nFigure11. Effective Equivalent Circuit Configuration for \nSingle-Module Remote Sense  \n \nOutput Voltage Set-Point Adjustment \nOutput voltage trim allows the user to increase or decrease \nthe output voltage set poin t of a module. This is \naccomplished by connecting an external resistor between the TRIM pin and either the +S or -S pins. The trim resistor \nshould be positioned close to the module. If not using the trim \nfeature, leave the TRIM pin open. To increase the output voltage, refer to Figure 12. A trim \nresistor, R\ntrimup, should be connected between the TRIM and \n+S, with a value of: \n \nFigure12.

The module will begin to \noperate at an input voltage above the under-voltage lockout \nturn-on threshold.  \n \nOutput Over Voltage Protection \nThe output over-voltage protection consists of circuitry that \nmonitors the voltage of the output terminals. If the output \nvoltage exceeds the over-voltage protection threshold, then \nthe module will operate in a hiccup mode until the \novervoltage cause is cleared.  \n \nOutput Over Current Protection \nTo provide protection in an output overload fault condition, \nthe module is equipped with internal current-limiting circuitry, and can endure current limiting for an unlimited duration. At \nthe instance of current-limit in ception, the module enters a \n"hiccup" mode of operation, whereby it shuts down and \nautomatically attempts to rest art. While the fault condition \nexists, the module will remain in this mode until the fault is \ncleared. The unit operates normally once the output current \nis reduced back into its specified range.  \n \nOver Temperature Protection  \nTo provide protection under certain fault conditions, the \nmodule is equipped with a thermal shutdown circuit. The \nmodule will shutdown when the Tref temperature exceeds OTP set value, but the thermal shutdown is not intended as \na guarantee that the module will restart when the \ntemperature beyond its rating. The module will \nautomatically restarts after it cools down. \n \nFigure14.Tref temperature measurement location  \nInput Under Voltage Lockout  \nInput under voltage lockout is standard with this converter, \nwhen input voltages below the input under voltage lockout Tref \n           \n  \n \n D o c u m e n t  N o .

It will only begin to \noperate once the input voltage is raised above the under \nvoltage lockout turn-on threshold. \n \nThermal Considerations \nThe power modules operate in a variety of thermal \nenvironments; however, sufficient cooling should be \nprovided to help ensure reliable operation of the unit. Heat \nis removed by conduction, convection, and radiation to the \nsurrounding environment.  \n \nConsiderations include ambient temperature, airflow, \nmodule power dissipation, and the need for increased \nreliability. A reduction in the operating temperature of the \nmodule will result in an increase in reliability.  \n \nHeat Transfer via Convection \nIncreased airflow over the module enhances the heat \ntransfer via convection. Thermal derating curves showing \nthe maximum output current that can be delivered at \ndifferent local ambient temperature (TA) for airflow \nconditions ranging from natural convection \n \nFigure15. Recommended Airflow Direction  \n Soldering Information （Surface \nmounting  Version） \nReflow Soldering Information \nThese power modules are large mass, low thermal \nresistance devices and typically heat up slower than other \nSMT components. It is re commended that the customer \nreview data sheets in order to customize the solder reflow \nprofile for each application board assembly. \nThe following instructions must be observed when SMT soldering these units. Failure to observe these instructions \nmay result in the failure of or cause damage to the modules, \nand can adversely affect long-term reliability. \n \nTypically, the eutectic solder melts at 217 ℃, wets the land, \nand subsequently wicks the device connection. Sufficient \ntime must be allowed to fuse the plating on the connection \nto ensure a reliable solder joint. There are several types of SMT reflow technologies currently used in the industry. \nThese surface mount power modules can be reliably \nsoldered using natural forced convection, IR (radiant \ninfrared), or a combination of convection/IR. For reliable \nsoldering the solder reflow profile should be established by accurately measuring the modules pin connector \ntemperatures. \n \nLead-free (Pb-free) solder processes \nFor Pb-free solder processes, a pin temperature (T PIN) in \nexcess of the solder melting temperature (T L, +217 to \n+221°C for Sn/Ag/Cu solder alloys) for more than 30 \nseconds, and a peak temperature of +235°C on all solder joints is recommended to ensure a reliable solder joint.\n \n For Pb-free solder processes, the product is qualified for \nMSL 3 according to IPC/JEDEC standard J-STD-020C. \nDuring reflow, T\nP must not exceed +245°C at any time.  \n           \n  \n \n D o c u m e n t  N o .
