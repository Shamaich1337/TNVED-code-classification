The output is band limited\nto frequencies above DC to below half the samplingfrequency.\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio between the\nRMS amplitude of the fundamental input frequency and\nthe RMS amplitude of all other frequency components\nexcept the first five harmonics and DC.\nTotal Harmonic Distortion\nTotal harmonic distortion is the ratio of the RMS sum of all\nharmonics of the input signal to the fundamental itself. Theout-of-band harmonics alias into the frequency band\nbetween DC and half the sampling frequency. THD is\nexpressed as:\nTHD = 20Log ( √(V2\n2 + V32 + V42 + . . . Vn2)/V1)\nwhere V1 is the RMS amplitude of the fundamental fre-quency and V2 through Vn are the amplitudes of thesecond through nth harmonics. The THD calculated in this\ndata sheet uses all the harmonics up to the fifth.\nIntermodulation Distortion\nIf the ADC input signal consists of more than one spectral\ncomponent, the ADC transfer function nonlinearity can\nproduce intermodulation distortion (IMD) in addition toTHD. IMD is the change in one sinusoidal input caused by\nthe presence of another sinusoidal input at a different\nfrequency.\nIf two pure sine waves of frequencies fa and fb are applied\nto the ADC input, nonlinearities in the ADC transfer func-\ntion can create distortion products at the sum and differ-ence frequencies of mfa ± nfb, where m and n = 0, 1, 2, 3,\netc. The 3rd order intermodulation products are 2fa + fb,2fb + fa, 2fa – fb and 2fb – fa. The intermodulationAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\ndistortion is defined as the ratio of the RMS value of eitherinput tone to the RMS value of the largest 3rd order\nintermodulation product.\nSpurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)\nSpurious free dynamic range is the peak harmonic or\nspurious noise that is the largest spectral component\nexcluding the input signal and DC. This value is expressedin decibels relative to the RMS value of a full scale input\nsignal.\nInput Bandwidth\nThe input bandwidth is that input frequency at which the\namplitude of the reconstructed fundamental is reduced by\n3dB for a full scale input signal.\nAperture Delay Time\nThe time from when CLK reaches mid-supply to the instant\nthat the input signal is held by the sample and hold circuit.\nAperture Delay Jitter\nThe variation in the aperture delay time from conversion to\nconversion. This random variation will result in noisewhen sampling an AC input. The signal to noise ratio due\nto the jitter alone will be:\nSNR\nJITTER  = –20log (2 π • fIN • tJITTER )\nCONVERTER OPERATION\nAs shown in Figure 1, the LTC2253/LTC2252 is a CMOS\npipelined multistep converter. The converter has sixpipelined ADC stages; a sampled analog input will result in\na digitized value five cycles later (see the Timing Diagram\nsection). For optimal AC performance the analog inputsshould be driven differentially. For cost sensitive applica-\ntions, the analog inputs can be driven single-ended with\nslightly worse harmonic distortion. The CLK input issingle-ended. The LTC2253/LTC2252 has two phases of\noperation, determined by the state of the CLK input pin.\nEach pipelined stage shown in Figure 1 contains an ADC,\na reconstruction DAC and an interstage residue amplifier.\nIn operation, the ADC quantizes the input to the stage and\nLTC2253/LTC2252\n1322532fathe quantized value is subtracted from the input by the\nDAC to produce a residue. The residue is amplified andoutput by the residue amplifier. Successive stages operateout of phase so that when the odd stages are outputtingtheir residue, the even stages are acquiring that residueand vice versa.\nWhen CLK is low, the analog input is sampled differentially\ndirectly onto the input sample-and-hold capacitors, insidethe “Input S/H” shown in the block diagram. At the instantthat CLK transitions from low to high, the sampled input isheld. While CLK is high, the held input voltage is bufferedby the S/H amplifier which drives the first pipelined ADCstage. The first stage acquires the output of the S/H duringthis high phase of CLK. When CLK goes back low, the firststage produces its residue which is acquired by thesecond stage. At the same time, the input S/H goes backto acquiring the analog input. When CLK goes back high,the second stage produces its residue which is acquiredby the third stage. An identical process is repeated for thethird, fourth and fifth stages, resulting in a fifth stageresidue that is sent to the sixth stage ADC for finalevaluation.\nEach ADC stage following the first has additional range to\naccommodate flash and amplifier offset errors. Resultsfrom all of the ADC stages are digitally synchronized suchthat the results can be properly combined in the correctionlogic before being sent to the output buffer.\nSAMPLE/HOLD OPERATION AND INPUT DRIVE\nSample/Hold Operation\nFigure 2 shows an equivalent circuit for the LTC2253/\nLTC2252 CMOS differential sample-and-hold. The analoginputs are connected to the sampling capacitors (C\nSAMPLE )\nthrough NMOS transistors. The capacitors shown at-tached to each input (C\nPARASITIC ) are the summation of all\nother capacitance associated with each input.\nDuring the sample phase when CLK is low, the transistors\nconnect the analog inputs to the sampling capacitors andthey charge to and track the differential input voltage.When CLK transitions from low to high, the sampled inputAPPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\nvoltage is held on the sampling capacitors. During the hold\nphase when CLK is high, the sampling capacitors are\ndisconnected from the input and the held voltage is passed\nto the ADC core for processing. As CLK transitions from\nhigh to low, the inputs are reconnected to the samplingcapacitors to acquire a new sample. Since the sampling\ncapacitors still hold the previous sample, a charging glitch\nproportional to the change in voltage between samples willbe seen at this time. If the change between the last sample\nand the new sample is small, the charging glitch seen at\nthe input will be small. If the input change is large, such asthe change seen with input frequencies near Nyquist, then\na larger charging glitch will be seen.\nSingle-Ended Input\nFor cost sensitive applications, the analog inputs can be\ndriven single-ended. With a single-ended input the har-\nmonic distortion and INL will degrade, but the SNR andDNL will remain unchanged. For a single-ended input, A\nIN+\nshould be driven with the input signal and A IN– should be\nconnected to 1.5V or V CM.\nCommon Mode Bias\nFor optimal performance the analog inputs should be\ndriven differentially. Each input should swing ±0.5V for\nthe 2V range or ±0.25V for the 1V range, around a\ncommon mode voltage of 1.5V. The V CM output pin (Pin\n31) may be used to provide the common mode bias level.V\nCM can be tied directly to the center tap of a transformer\nVDD\nVDD\nVDD15Ω\n15ΩCPARASITIC\n1pF\nCPARASITIC\n1pFCSAMPLE\n3.5pF\nCSAMPLE\n3.5pFLTC2253/LTC2252\nAIN+\nAIN–\nCLK\n22532 F02\nFigure 2.

The V CM pin must be bypassed to\nground close to the ADC with a 2.2 µF or greater capacitor.\nInput Drive Impedance\nAs with all high performance, high speed ADCs, the\ndynamic performance of the LTC2253/LTC2252 can beinfluenced by the input drive circuitry, particularly thesecond and third harmonics. Source impedance and input\nreactance can influence SFDR. At the falling edge of CLK,\nthe sample-and-hold circuit will connect the 3.5pFsampling capacitor to the input pin and start the samplingperiod. The sampling period ends when CLK rises, holdingthe sampled input on the sampling capacitor. Ideally theinput circuitry should be fast enough to fully charge\nthe sampling capacitor during the sampling period\n1/(2F\nENCODE ); however, this is not always possible and the\nincomplete settling may degrade the SFDR. The samplingglitch has been designed to be as linear as possible tominimize the effects of incomplete settling.\nFor the best performance, it is recommended to have a\nsource impedance of 100 Ω or less for each input. The\nsource impedance should be matched for the differential\ninputs. Poor matching will result in higher even orderharmonics, especially the second.\nInput Drive Circuits\nFigure 3 shows the LTC2253/LTC2252 being driven by an\nRF transformer with a center tapped secondary. The\nsecondary center tap is DC biased with V\nCM, setting the\nADC input signal at its optimum DC level. Terminating onthe transformer secondary is desirable, as this provides acommon mode path for charging glitches caused by thesample and hold. Figure 3 shows a 1:1 turns ratio trans-\nformer. Other turns ratios can be used if the source\nimpedance seen by the ADC does not exceed 100 Ω for\neach ADC input. A disadvantage of using a transformer isthe loss of low frequency response. Most small RFtransformers have poor performance at frequencies\nbelow 1MHz.\nFigure 4 demonstrates the use of a differential amplifier to\nconvert a single ended input signal into a differential input\nsignal. The advantage of this method is that it provides lowAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nfrequency input response; however, the limited gain band-\nwidth of most op amps will limit the SFDR at high input\nfrequencies.\nFigure 5 shows a single-ended input circuit. The imped-\nance seen by the analog inputs should be matched. This\ncircuit is not recommended if low distortion is required.\nThe 25 Ω resistors and 12pF capacitor on the analog inputs\nserve two purposes: isolating the drive circuitry from the\nFigure 3.

An external bypass capacitor is required for\nthe 1.5V reference output, V\nCM. This provides a high\nfrequency low impedance path to ground for internal and\nexternal circuitry.\nLTC2253/LTC2252\n1622532faAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nThe difference amplifier generates the high and low refer-\nence for the ADC. High speed switching circuits are\nconnected to these outputs and they must be externallybypassed. Each output has two pins. The multiple output\npins are needed to reduce package inductance. Bypass\ncapacitors must be connected as shown in Figure 9.\nOther voltage ranges in-between the pin selectable ranges\ncan be programmed with two external resistors as shown\nin Figure 10. An external reference can be used by applyingits output directly or through a resistor divider to SENSE.\nIt is not recommended to drive the SENSE pin with a logic\ndevice. The SENSE pin should be tied to the appropriatelevel as close to the converter as possible. If the SENSE pin\nis driven externally, it should be bypassed to ground as\nclose to the device as possible with a 1 µF ceramic capacitor.\nFigure 10. 1.5V Range ADCVCM\nSENSE1.5V\n0.75V2.2 µF\n12k\n1µF12k\n22532 F10LTC2253/\nLTC2252In applications where jitter is critical, such as when digitiz-\ning high input frequencies, use as large an amplitude as\npossible.

The\n2V input range will provide the best signal-to-noise perfor-\nmance while maintaining excellent SFDR. The 1V inputrange will have better SFDR performance, but the SNR will\ndegrade by 4.2dB.\nDriving the Clock Input\nThe CLK input can be driven directly with a CMOS or TTL\nlevel signal. A sinusoidal clock can also be used along with\na low jitter squaring circuit before the CLK pin (Figure 11).\nThe noise performance of the LTC2253/LTC2252 can\ndepend on the clock signal quality as much as on the\nanalog input.

The LVDS or PECL to CMOS translators\nprovide little degradation below 70MHz, but at 140MHz\nwill degrade the SNR compared to the transformer solu-tion. The nature of the received signals also has a large\nbearing on how much SNR degradation will be experi-\nenced. For high crest factor signals such as WCDMA orOFDM, where the nominal power level must be at least 6dB\nto 8dB below full scale, the use of these translators will\nhave a lesser impact.\nThe transformer in the example may be terminated with\nthe appropriate termination for the signaling in use. The\nuse of a transformer with a 1:4 impedance ratio may bedesirable in cases where lower voltage differential signals\nare considered. The center tap may be bypassed to ground\nthrough a capacitor close to the ADC if the differentialsignals originate on a different plane. The use of a capaci-\ntor at the input may result in peaking, and depending on\ntransmission line length may require a 10 Ω to 20Ω ohm\nseries resistor to act as both a low pass filter for high\nfrequency noise that may be induced into the clock line by\nneighboring digital signals, as well as a damping mecha-nism for reflections.\nMaximum and Minimum Conversion Rates\nThe maximum conversion rate for the LTC2253/LTC2252\nis 125Msps (LTC2253) and 105Msps (LTC2252). The\nlower limit of the LTC2253/LTC2252 sample rate is deter-\nmined by droop of the sample-and-hold circuits. Thepipelined architecture of this ADC relies on storing analog\nsignals on small valued capacitors. Junction leakage will\ndischarge the capacitors. The specified minimum operat-ing frequency for the LTC2253/LTC2252 is 1Msps.\nClock Duty Cycle Stabilizer\nAn optional clock duty cycle stabilizer circuit ensures\nhigh performance even if the input clock has a non 50%\nduty cycle. Using the clock duty cycle stabilizer is\nrecommended for most applications. To use the clockduty cycle stabilizer, the MODE pin should be connected to\n1/3V\nDD or 2/3V DD using external resistors.\nThis circuit uses the rising edge of the CLK pin to sample\nthe analog input. The falling edge of CLK is ignored and theinternal falling edge is generated by a phase-locked loop.The input clock duty cycle can vary from 40% to 60% and\nthe clock duty cycle stabilizer will maintain a constant 50%\ninternal duty cycle. If the clock is turned off for a longperiod of time, the duty cycle stabilizer circuit will require\na hundred clock cycles for the PLL to lock onto the\ninput clock.\nFor applications where the sample rate needs to be changed\nquickly, the clock duty cycle stabilizer can be disabled. If\nthe duty cycle stabilizer is disabled, care should be takento make the sampling clock have a 50% ( ±5%) duty cycle.\nDIGITAL OUTPUTS\nTable 1 shows the relationship between the analog input\nvoltage, the digital data bits and the overflow bit.\nTable 1.

Each buffer is powered by OV DD and OGND,\nisolated from the ADC power and ground. The additional\nN-channel transistor in the output driver allows operation\ndown to low voltages. The internal resistor in serieswith the output makes the output appear as 50 Ω to\nexternal circuitry and may eliminate the need for externaldamping resistors.\nAs with all high speed/high resolution converters, the\ndigital output loading can affect the performance.

For\nexample if the converter is driving a DSP powered by a 1.8V\nsupply, then OV DD should be tied to that same 1.8V supply.\nOVDD can be powered with any voltage from 500mV up to\n3.6V. OGND can be powered with any voltage from GND upto 1V and must be less than OV\nDD. The logic outputs will\nswing between OGND and OV DD.\nOutput Enable\nThe outputs may be disabled with the output enable pin, OE.\nOE high disables all data outputs including OF. The dataaccess and bus relinquish times are too slow to allow the\noutputs to be enabled and disabled during full speed\noperation. The output Hi-Z state is intended for use duringlong periods of inactivity.\nSleep and Nap Modes\nThe converter may be placed in shutdown or nap modes\nto conserve power. Connecting SHDN to GND results in\nnormal operation. Connecting SHDN to V\nDD and OE to V DD\nresults in sleep mode, which powers down all circuitry\nincluding the reference and typically dissipates 1mW. When\nexiting sleep mode it will take milliseconds for the output\ndata to become valid because the reference capacitors haveto recharge and stabilize. Connecting SHDN to V\nDD and OE\nto GND results in nap mode, which typically dissipates15mW. In nap mode, the on-chip reference circuit is kepton, so that recovery from nap mode is faster than that from\nsleep mode, typically taking 100 clock cycles. In both sleep\nand nap modes, all digital outputs are disabled and enterthe Hi-Z state.\nGrounding and Bypassing\nThe LTC2253/LTC2252 require a printed circuit board with\na clean, unbroken ground plane. A multilayer board with\nan internal ground plane is recommended. Layout for the\nprinted circuit board should ensure that digital and analogsignal lines are separated as much as possible. In particu-\nlar, care should be taken not to run any digital track\nalongside an analog signal track or underneath the ADC.\nHigh quality ceramic bypass capacitors should be used at\nthe V\nDD, OV DD, VCM, REFH, and REFL pins. Bypass capaci-\ntors must be located as close to the pins as possible. OfTable 2.

Digital Ouput Buffer\nfull speed operation the capacitive load should be kept\nunder 10pF.\nLower OV DD voltages will also help reduce interference\nfrom the digital outputs.\nData Format\nUsing the MODE pin, the LTC2253/LTC2252 parallel\ndigital output can be selected for offset binary or 2’scomplement format. Connecting MODE to GND or 1/3V\nDD\nselects offset binary output format. Connecting MODE to2/3V\nDD or V DD selects 2’s complement output format. An\nexternal resistor divider can be used to set the 1/3V DD or\n2/3V DD logic values. Table 2 shows the logic states for the\nMODE pin.\nOverflow Bit\nWhen OF outputs a logic high the converter is either\noverranged or underranged.\nOutput Driver Power\nSeparate output power and ground pins allow the output\ndrivers to be isolated from the analog circuitry.

This capacitor should be placed as close to the\ndevice as possible (1.5mm or less). A size 0402 ceramic\ncapacitor is recommended. The large 2.2 µF capacitor\nbetween REFH and REFL can be somewhat further away.\nThe traces connecting the pins and bypass capacitors\nmust be kept short and should be made as wide aspossible.\nThe LTC2253/LTC2252 differential inputs should run par-\nallel and close to each other. The input traces should be asshort as possible to minimize capacitance and to minimize\nnoise pickup.\nHeat Transfer\nMost of the heat generated by the LTC2253/LTC2252 is\ntransferred from the die through the bottom-side exposed\npad and package leads onto the printed circuit board. Forgood electrical and thermal performance, the exposed pad\nshould be soldered to a large grounded pad on the PC\nboard. It is critical that all ground pins are connected to aground plane of sufficient area.\nClock Sources for Undersampling\nUndersampling raises the bar on the clock source and the\nhigher the input frequency, the greater the sensitivity to\nclock jitter or phase noise. A clock source that degrades\nSNR of a full-scale signal by 1dB at 70MHz will degradeSNR by 3dB at 140MHz, and 4.5dB at 190MHz.\nIn cases where absolute clock frequency accuracy isrelatively unimportant and only a single ADC is required,a 3V canned oscillator from vendors such as Saronix or\nVectron can be placed close to the ADC and simply\nconnected directly to the ADC. If there is any distance tothe ADC, some source termination to reduce ringing that\nmay occur even over a fraction of an inch is advisable. You\nmust not allow the clock to overshoot the supplies orperformance will suffer. Do not filter the clock signal witha narrow band filter unless you have a sinusoidal clock\nsource, as the rise and fall time artifacts present in typical\ndigital clock signals will be translated into phase noise.\nThe lowest phase noise oscillators have single-ended\nsinusoidal outputs, and for these devices the use of a filter\nclose to the ADC may be beneficial. This filter should beclose to the ADC to both reduce roundtrip reflection times,\nas well as reduce the susceptibility of the traces between\nthe filter and the ADC. If you are sensitive to close-in phasenoise, the power supply for oscillators and any buffers\nmust be very stable, or propagation delay variation with\nsupply will translate into phase noise. Even though theseclock sources may be regarded as digital devices, do not\noperate them on a digital supply. If your clock is also used\nto drive digital devices such as an FPGA, you should locatethe oscillator, and any clock fan-out devices close to the\nADC, and give the routing to the ADC precedence. The\nclock signals to the FPGA should have series terminationat the source to prevent high frequency noise from the\nFPGA disturbing the substrate of the clock fan-out device.\nIf you use an FPGA as a programmable divider, you mustre-time the signal using the original oscillator, and the re-\ntiming flip-flop as well as the oscillator should be close to\nthe ADC, and powered with a very quiet supply.\nFor cases where there are multiple ADCs, or where the\nclock source originates some distance away, differential\nclock distribution is advisable. This is advisable both fromthe perspective of EMI, but also to avoid receiving noise\nfrom digital sources both radiated, as well as propagated\nin the waveguides that exist between the layers of multi-layer PCBs. The differential pairs must be close together,\nand distanced from other signals. The differential pair\nshould be guarded on both sides with copper distanced atleast 3x the distance between the traces, and grounded\nwith vias no more than 1/4 inch apart.\nLTC2253/LTC2252\n2022532faAPPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\n12\nC80.1µF\nC110.1µF34 5\nVDD7\nVDDVDDGND932\nVCM31302933\nJP2OE10118\nC72.2µF\nC61µF\nC91µFC40.1µFC212pF\nVDD\nVDDVDDGND\nJP1SHDNC152.2µFC160.1µFC180.1µFC254.7µFE2VDD3VE4PWRGND\nVDDVCC22532 TA02\nC17 0.1µF\nC200.1µF\nC190.1µFC140.1µF\nR1033Ω\nE1\nEXT REFR141k R151k R161k\nR71k\nR849.9ΩR324.9ΩR224.9Ω\nR624.9Ω\nR1OPTR424.9Ω\nR550Ω\nT1\nETC1-1T\nC10.1µF\nC30.1µF\nJ3\nCLOCKINPUTNC7SVU04NC7SVU04C130.1µF\nC100.1µF\nC54.7µF\n6.3V\nL1BEAD\nVDDC120.1µFR91k\nJ1\nANALOGINPUTAIN+\nAIN–\nREFHREFH\n6REFLREFL VDDCLKSHDN VDDVCMSENSEMODEGND\nLTC2253/LTC2252 OED11\nGNDD0NCNC D1D2D3 D5D4 D6 D8D9 OF\nOVDDVCC\nOGNDD10D72625 12131415 1716 18 2223 27282120 24 19OE1I0 OE2LE1LE2V CCVCC\nVCCGNDGNDGND I 1I2 I4 I3 I5 I7I8 I12 I11 I10 I13I14I15 I9O11O10\nI6VCCO0GNDGND GNDVCCVCC\nGND\n34453942254824147464443414038373635333230292726VCC28\n74VCX16373MTD312115181047RN1C 33Ω\n23568911121314161719202223\nGNDO1O2 O4O3 O5 O7O8O12O13O14 O15O9 O62523 27293133353739 2119 15 17 13 97 13524\n112624 3028 3432 3840\n393735333129272523211917 1513119753140\n3201S-40G13836343230282624222018 161412108642\n36\nA3A2A1A0SDAWPVCC\n12348\n24LC025765\nSCL2220 16 18 14 108612\n123\n5••\n4\nVCM12VDD\nVDD342/3VDD\n561/3VDD\n78GND\nJP4 MODE\n12VDD\n34VCM\nVDDVCM56EXT REFJP3 SENSERN1B 33Ω\nRN1A 33Ω\nRN2D 33Ω\nRN2C 33Ω\nRN2B 33Ω\nRN2A 33Ω\nRN3D 33Ω\nRN3C 33Ω\nRN3B 33Ω\nRN3A 33Ω\nRN4D 33Ω\nRN4B 33Ω\nRN4A 33ΩR1310k\nR1110kR1210k\nRN4C 33Ω\nRN1D 33Ω\nC281µF\nC270.01µF\nVCCVDD\nNC7SV86P5X\nBYPGNDADJOUTSHDNGNDIN\n12348\nLT1763765\nGND\nR18100k R17105k\nC2610µF\n6.3VE3GNDC210.1µFC220.1µFC230.1µFC240.1µF\nEvaluation Circuit Schematic\nLTC2253/LTC2252\n2122532faAPPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\nSilkscreen Top Topside\nInner Layer 2 GND\nLTC2253/LTC2252\n2222532faAPPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\nInner Layer 3 Power Topside\nSilkscreen Bottom\nLTC2253/LTC2252\n2322532fa\nInformation furnished by Linear Technology Corporation is believed to be accurate and reliable.\nHowever, no responsibility is assumed for its use.
