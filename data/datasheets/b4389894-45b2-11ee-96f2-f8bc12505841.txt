Converters subject to dynamic \nloading exceeding 25% of rated current must be reviewed by \nVicor Applications Engineering to ensure that the converter will \noperate properly.\nUnder dynamic-load, light-load or no-load conditions, the converter \nmay emit audible noise. Converters that utilize remote sense may \nrequire compensation circuitry to offset the phase lag caused \nby the external output leads and load impedance. If an external \nremote -sense circuit is used, the remote-sense leads must be protected for conditions such as lead reversal, noise pickup, open \ncircuit or excessive output lead resistance between the sense \npoint and the converters output terminals. For applications that \nmay draw more than the rated current, a fast-acting electronic \ncircuit breaker must be utilized to protect the converter. Under \nno circumstance should the rated current be exceeded. Utilizing \nor testing of current limit or short circuit current will damage the \nconverter. Ensure that the total output capacitance connected to \nthe converter does not  exceed the limits on Page 16, “Maximum \nOutput Capacitance”, of the design guide.\n300V Micro Family Rev 10.7\nPage 10 of 14  05/2022\n300V InputDisable\nDisable = PC < 2.3V+OUT\nSC\n–OUT+IN\nPC\nPR\n–IN\nFigure 2 —  Module enable/disableInput Undervoltage\nInput Overvoltage\nOver Temperature\nModule Faults\n2 – 20ms typ.\nf(VIN)Auto\nRestart\n5.7VDC\n(0 – 3mA)50Ω\nSW2 SW3\n1.23VDC6kΩ1kΩSW1\nSW1, 2, & 3 shown\nin "Fault" positio n+OUT\nSC\n–OUT+IN\nPC\nPR\n–IN1MΩ\nFigure 3 —  PC/SC module alarm logic\nFigure 4 —  LED on-state indicator4k/uni03A9 "Module\n  Enabled"  +OUT\nSC\n–OUT+IN\nPC\nPR\n–IN2 – 20ms typ.Fault\nSCPC\n1.23V5.7V400µs typ.\nFigure 5 —  PC/SC module alarm timing\nOptocoupler+OUT\nSC\n–OUT+IN\nPC\nPR\n–IN4kAlarm\n1.00V+OUT\nSC\n–OUT+IN\nPC\nPR\n–INComparator\nFigure 6 —  Isolated on-state indicator Figure 7 —  Secondary-side on-state indicatorModule Enable/Disable\nThe module may be disabled by pulling PC to 0V (2.3V max) with \nrespect to the –Input. This may be done with an open collector \ntransistor, relay, or optocoupler. Converters may be disabled with a \nsingle transistor or relay either directly or via “OR’ing” diodes for 2 \nor more converters. See Figure 2.\nPrimary Auxiliary Supply\nDuring normal operation only, the PC Pin can source 5.7V \n@ 1.5mA. In the example shown in Figure 4, PC powers a \nmodule enabled LED.Module Alarm\nThe module contains “watchdog” circuitry which monitors input \nvoltage, operating temperature and internal operating parameters. \nIn the event that any of these parameters are outside of their \nallowable operating range, the module will shut down and PC will \ngo low. PC will periodically go high and the module will check to \nsee if the fault (as an example, Input Undervoltage) has cleared. \nIf the fault has not been cleared, PC will go low again and the \ncycle will restart. The SC pin will go low in the event of a fault \nand return to its normal state after the fault has been cleared. See \nFigures 3 and 5.Primary Control – PC Pin\n300V Micro Family Rev 10.7\nPage 11 of 14  05/2022\n300V InputSecondary Control – SC Pin\nOutput Voltage Programming\nThe output voltage of the converter can be adjusted or \nprogrammed via fixed resistors, potentiometers or voltage \nDACs. See Figure 8.\nTrim Down\n1. This converter is not a constant-power device – it has a \nconstant current limit. Hence, available output power is \nreduced by the same percentage that output voltage is \ntrimmed down. Do not exceed maximum rated output current.\n2. The trim-down resistor must be connected between the SC \nand –S pins. Do not bypass the SC pin directly with a capacitor.\nTrim Up\n1. The converter is rated for a maximum delivered power. To \nensure that maximum rated power is not exceeded, reduce \nmaximum output current by the same percentage increase in \noutput voltage.\n2. The trim-up resistor must be connected between the SC and \n+S pins. Do not bypass the SC pin directly with a capacitor.\n3. Do not trim the converter above maximum trim range (typically \n+10%) or the output over voltage protection circuitry may  \nbe activated.\nParallel Bus – PR Pin\nParallel Operation\nThe PR pin supports paralleling for increased power with N+1 \n(N+M) redundancy. Modules of the same input voltage, output \nvoltage, and power level will current share if all PR pins are \nsuitably interfaced.Compatible interface architectures include the following:\nAC-coupled single-wire interface. All PR pins are connected to a \nsingle communication bus through 0.001µF (500V) capacitors. This \ninterface supports current sharing and is fault tolerant except for \nthe communication bus. Up to three converters may be paralleled \nby this method. See Figure 9.\nTransformer-coupled interface.  For paralleling four or more \nconverters a transformer-coupled interface is required, and under \ncertain conditions a PR buffer circuit. \nFor details on parallel operation please refer to the  \nDesign Guide & Applications Manual for Maxi, Mini , Micro Family.\nFigure 8 —  Output voltage trim-down and trim-up circuitLoad\nRD\nTrim DownError\nAmp\n1kΩ\n1.23V0.033μF+OUT\nSC\n–OUT+IN\nPC\nPR\n–IN\n 1,000VOUT\n VNOM – VOUTRD (Ω)  =\n 1,000 (VOUT – 1.23) VNOM\n 1.23 (VOUT – VNOM)RU (Ω)  = – 1,000RU\nTrim Up\nTrim resistor values calculated automatically:\nOn-line calculators for trim resistor values are available on \nthe vicor website at:  \nasp.vicorpower.com/calculators/calculators.asp?calc=1\nResistor values can be calculated for fixed trim up, fixed \ntrim down and for variable trim up or down.Figure 9 —  AC-coupled single-wire interface  \n* See Maxi, Mini, Micro Design Guide+IN\nPC\nPR\n–IN\n+IN\nPC\nPR\n–INModule 2Module 1+\nParallel\nBus–0.2µF\n0.001µF\n0.2µF\n0.001µFLow inductance \nground plane \nor bus4.7nF\n4.7nF\n4.7nF\n4.7nFR1*\nR1*\n+IN\nPC\nPR\n–IN\n+IN\nPC\nPR\n–INModule 2Module 1 T1\nT2+\n–0.2µF\n0.2µF\nParallel\nBus4.7nF\n4.7nF\n4.7nF4.7nFR1*\nR1*\nFigure 10 —  Transformer-coupled interface\nNumber of Converters in Parallel *R1 value Ω\n2 75\n3 50\n4 33\n5 or more refer to application note: \nDesigning High-Power Arrays \nusing Maxi, Mini, Micro \nFamily D C-DC Converters\n300V Micro Family Rev 10.7\nPage 12 of 14  05/2022\n300V Input\n++\n––++\n––R1\nR2 U1R3\n2.55 kR4\nR5\n1.00kU2\nTLV431\nC1R7 21.0k\nC2\n0.22µFR84.02kC3\nR9\nR10\n1.24k U3LM10+S    \n–S     +OUT\nSC\n–OUTR Load\nPS2701R11\n36.5kR6\n1.65k 470pF200mVVcc\nGnd\n*See Component Selection section below .*\n***\n*+OUT\nSC\n–OUT\nL\nO\nA\nDPlane\nGround\nPlaneModule #1\nDesignated \nParent\nModule #2\ntrimmed \ndown 2%\nModule #3\ntrimmed \ndown 4%+OUT\nSC\n–OUT\n+OUT\nSC\n–OUT• The + OUT and – OUT \npower buses should be \ndesigned to minimize \nand balance parasitic \nimpedance from each \nmodule output to the \nload.\n• At the discretion of the \npower system designer, \na subset of all modules \nwithin an array may be \nconfigured as children \nby connecting SC  \nto –OUT.\n• Do not use output \nOR’ing diodes with \nMicroMods.• This module is designed for point-of-load regulation, where remote sensing is \nnot required.
