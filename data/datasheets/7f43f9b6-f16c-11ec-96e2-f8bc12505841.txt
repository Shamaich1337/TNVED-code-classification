This pin is open -drain driven \nand may  be wire -ORed with any number of other \nopen -drain or open -collector devices.  \nDEVICE/PAGE ADDRESSES (A2 , A1, A0): The A2, \nA1 and A0 pins are device address inputs that are \nhardwired  or left not connected for hardware \ncompatibility with other FM24CXX ／FM24CXX \ndevices.  When the pins are hardwired, a s many as \neight  512K devices may be addressed on a single \nbus system  (device addressing is discussed in detail \nunder the Device  Addressing se ction).  If the pins \nare left floating, the A2, A1 and A0 pins will be internally pulled down to GND if the capacitive \ncoupling to the circuit board V CC plane is <3pF, if \ncoupling is >3pF, FMSH recommends connecting \nthe address pins to GND.  \nWRITE PROTECT (W P): The FM24C 512D has a \nWrite Protect pin that provides hardware data \nprotection. The WP pin allows normal write operations  \nwhen connected to ground (GND). When the Write \nProtect pin is connected to VCC, all write operations \nto the memory are inhibited. If  the pin is left floating, \nthe WP pin will be internally pulled down to GND if \nthe capacitive coupling to the circuit board Vcc plane \nis <3pF. If coupling is >3pF, FMSH recommends \nconnecting the WP to GND. Switching WP to VCC \nprior to a write operation cre ates a software write \nprotected function.  \nWrite Protect Description   \nWP Pin  Status  Part of the Memory  Protected   \nFM24C 512D \nWP= VCC Full Memory   \nWP= GND  Normal Read/Write Operations   \n \nMemory Organization  \nFM24C 512D, 512K SERIAL EEPROM:  Internally organi zed with 512 pages of 128 bytes each,  the 512K \nrequires a  16-bit data word address for random word addressing.  \nSecurity Sector : The FM24C512D offers  128-byte Security Sectors which can be written and (later) \npermanently locked in Read -only mode.

Data on \nthe SDA  pin may change only during SCL low time \nperiods (refer to  Figure 4 ). Data changes during \nSCL high periods will indicate a start or stop \ncondition as defined below.  \nSTART CONDITION: A high -to-low transition of SDA \nwith SCL high is a start condition which must \nprecede any other command (refer to Figure 5 ). \nSTOP CONDITION: A low -to-high transition of SDA \nwith SCL high is a stop condition. After a read \nsequence, the  stop command will place the EEPROM  \nin a standby power  mode (refer to Figure 5 ). \nACKNOWLEDGE: All address and data words are \nserially transmitted to and from the EEPROM in 8 -bit words. The EEPROM sends a zero during the ninth \nclock cycle  to acknowledge that it has received \neach word.   \nSTANDBY MODE: The FM24C 512D features  a \nlow-power standby mode which is enabled: (a) \nupon power -up and (b) after the receipt of the stop \nbit and the  completion of any internal operations.  \nMemory  RESET : After an interruption in protocol, \npower loss or system  reset, any 2-wire part can be \nreset in follow ing these steps : \n1. Clock up to 9 Cycles,  \n2. Look for SDA high in each cycle while SCL is \nhigh and then,  \n3.

This is common to all the \nEEPROM devices.  \nThe 512K EEPROM uses the three device address \nbits A2, A1, A0 to allow as many as eight devices on \nthe same bus. These bits must compare to their \ncorresponding hard -wired input pins. The A2, A1 and \nA0 pins use an  internal proprietary circuit that biases \nthem to a logic low condition if the pins are allowed \nto float.  \nThe Module package  device address word also \nconsists of a mandatory „1010 ‟(Ah) sequence for the \nfirst four most significant bits. The next 3 bits are all \nzero. \nThe eighth bit of the device address is the read/write \noperation select bit. A read operation is initiated if \nthis bit is high and a write operation is initiated if this \nbit is low.  \nUpon a compare of the device address, the \nEEPROM will output a zero. If a compare is not \nmade, the device  will return to a standby state.  \nUnique ID  Access:  The FM24C512D  utilizes a \nseparate  memory block containing a factory \nprogrammed 128-bit unique ID . Access to this \nmemory location is obtained by beginning the devic e address  word with a „1011‟(Bh) sequence  (refer to \nTable 1 ). The behavior of the next three bits (A2, A1  \nand A0) remain s the same as during a  standard \nmemory addressing sequence.  \nThe eighth bit of the device address needs be set to \na one to read the Seria l Number. Writing  or altering \nthe 128 -bit unique ID  is not possible.  \nFor more details on accessing this special feature,  \nSee Read Operations on page 1 4. \nSecurity Sector  Access: The FM24C512D offers  \n128-byte Security Sector  which can be written and \n(later) permanently locked in Read -only mode.  \nAccess to this memory location is obtained by \nbeginning the device address  word with a „1011‟(Bh) \nsequence  (refer to Table 1 ). The behavior of the next \nthree bits (A2, A1  and A0) remain s the same as during \na standard m emory addressing sequence.  \nThe eighth bit of the device address is the read/write \noperation select bit. A read operation is initiated if \nthis bit is high and a write operation is initiated if this \nbit is low.  \nFor more details on accessing this special feat ure, See \nWrite Operations and Read Operations on page 1 3,14. \nNOISE PROTECTION: Special internal circuitry \nplaced on the SDA and SCL pins prevent small noise \nspikes from activating the device.  \nDATA SECURITY: The Device  has a hardware data \nprotection scheme that allows the user to write protect \nthe entire memory when the WP pin is at V CC. \n \nSCL\nDATA \nIN\nDATA \nOUT\nSTART ACKNOWLEDGE1 8 9 \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 512D  2-Wire Serial EEPROM                   Ver.1.2                                       12 Table  1-1．Device Address    \n \nAccess Area  Bit7 Bit6 Bit5 Bit4 Bit3 Bit2 Bit1 Bit0 \nData Memory  1 0 1 0 A2 A1 A0 R/W \nSecurity Sector  1 0 1 1 A2 A1 A0 R/W \nSecurity Sector  Lock Bit  1 0 1 1 A2 A1 A0 R/W \nUnique ID Number  1 0 1 1 A2 A1 A0 1 \n MSB       LSB \n \nTable 1 -2．First Word Address  \n \nAccess Area  Bit7 Bit6 Bit5 Bit4 Bit3 Bit2 Bit1 Bit0 \nData Memory  A15 A14 A13 A12 A11 A10 A9 A8 \nSecurity Sector  x x x x x 0 0 x \nSecurity Secto r Lock Bit  x x x x x 1 0 X \nUnique ID Number  x x x x x x 1 x \n MSB       LSB \nNOTE: x = Don `t care bit . \n \nTable 1 -3．Second Word Address  \n \nAccess Area  Bit7 Bit6 Bit5 Bit4 Bit3 Bit2 Bit1 Bit0 \nData Memory  A7 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 \nSecurity Sector  x A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 \nSecurity Sector  Lock Bit  x x x x x x x x \nUnique ID Number  x x x x 0 0 0 0 \n MSB       LSB \nNOTE: x = Don `t care bit . \n \n \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 512D  2-Wire Serial EEPROM                   Ver.1.2                                       13 Write  Operations  \nBYTE WRITE: A write operation requires two 8-bit \ndata word address following the device address \nword and a cknowledgment. Upon receipt of this \naddress, the EEPROM will again respond with a \nzero and then clock in the first 8 -bit data word. \nFollowing receipt of the 8 -bit data word, the \nEEPROM will output a zero and the addressing \ndevice, such as a microcontroller , must terminate \nthe write sequence with a stop condition. At this \ntime the EEPROM enters an internally -timed write \ncycle, tWR, to the nonvolatile memory. All inputs are \ndisabled during this write cycle and the EEPROM \nwill not respond until the write is co mplete ( see \nFigure 7 on page 15 ). \nPAGE WRITE: The 512K EEPROM is capable of  \n128-byte page write s. A page write is initiated the \nsame  way as a byte write, but the microcontroller \ndoes not send a stop condition after the first data \nword is clocked in. Instea d, after the EEPROM  \nacknowledges receipt of the first data word, the \nmicrocontroller can transmit up to 127 more data \nwords. The EEPROM will respond with a zero after \neach data word received. The microcontroller must \nterminate the page write sequence with a stop \ncondition ( see Figure 8 on page 15 ). \nThe data word address lower seven  bits are \ninternally incremented following the receipt of each \ndata word. The higher data word address bits are \nnot incremented, retaining the memory page row \nlocation. When the w ord address, internally \ngenerated, reaches the page boundary, the \nfollowing byte is placed at the beginning of the \nsame page. If more than 128 data words are \ntransmitted to the EEPROM, the data word \naddress will “roll over” and previous data will be \noverwr itten.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ACKNOWLEDGE POLLING: Once the internally \ntimed write cycle has started and the EEPROM \ninputs are disabled, acknowledge polling can be \ninitiated. This involves sending a start condition \nfollowed by the device address word. The \nread/write bi t is representative of the operation \ndesired. Only if the internal write cycle has \ncompleted will the EEPROM respond with a zero \nallowing the read or write sequence to continue.  \n \nWRITE  SECURITY SECTOR : Write the Security \nSector  is similar to the page write  but requires use \nof device address , and the special word address \nseen in Table 1  on page 1 2. The higher address \nbits A DDR< 15:7> are don‟t care except for \naddress bits A DDR<10: 9>，which must be equal to \n„00b‟. Lower address bits A DDR<6:0> define the \nbyte address inside the Security Sector  (see \nFigure 12 on page 1 6). \nIf the Security Sector  is locked, the data bytes \ntransferred during the Write Security Sector  \noperation  are not ackno wledged (NoAck).   \nLOCK SECURITY SECTOR : Lock the Security \nSector  is similar to the byte write but requires use \nof device address , and special word address  seen \nin Table 1  on page 1 2. The word address bits \nADDR<10: 9> must be „10b‟, all other  word  address \nbits are don ‟t care.  The data byte must be equal to \nthe binary value xxxx xx1x, where x is don't care  \n(see Figure 14 on page 1 7). \nIf the Security Sector  is locked, the data bytes \ntransferred during the Lock Security Sector  \noperation are not acknowledged (NoA ck). \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 512D  2-Wire Serial EEPROM                   Ver.1.2                                       14 Read Operati ons\nRead operations are initiated the same way as write \noperations with the exception that the read/write select \nbit in the device address word is set to one.  \nCURRENT ADDRESS READ: The internal data word \naddress counter maintains the las t address accessed \nduring the last read or write operation, incremented by \none. This address stays valid between operations as \nlong as the chip power is maintained. The address “roll \nover” during read is from the last byte of the last \nmemory page to the fi rst byte of the first page. The \naddress “roll over” during write is from the last byte of \nthe current page to the first byte of the same page.  \nOnce the device address with the read/write select bit \nset to one is clocked in and acknowledged by the \nEEPROM, t he current address data word is serially \nclocked out. The microcontroller does not respond with \nan input zero but does generate a following stop \ncondition ( see Figure 9 on page 15 ). \nRANDOM READ: A random read requires a “dummy” \nbyte write sequence to load in the data word address. \nOnce the device address word and data word address \nare clocked in and acknowledged by the EEPROM, \nthe microcontroller must generate another start \ncondition. The microcontroller now initiates a current \naddress read by sending a dev ice address with the \nread/write select bit high. The EEPROM \nacknowledges the device address and serially clocks \nout the data word. The microcontroller does not \nrespond with a zero but does generate a following stop \ncondition ( see Figure 10 on page 16 ). \nSEQUENTIAL READ: Sequential reads are initiated \nby either a current address read or a random address \nread. After the microcontroller receives a data word, it \nresponds with an acknowledge. As long as the \nEEPROM receives an  acknowledge, it will continue to \nincrement the data word address and serially clock out \nsequential data words. When the memory address \nlimit is reached, the data word address will “roll over” \nand the sequential read will continue. The sequential \nread operation is terminated when the microcont roller \ndoes not respond with a zero but does generate a \nfollowing stop condition ( see Figure 11 on page 16 ) \nUNIQUE ID  READ : Reading the serial number is \nsimilar to the sequential read but requires use of the  \ndevice address, a dummy write, and the use of sp ecific \nword address  seen in Table 1  on page 1 2. The higher \naddress bits A DDR< 15:4> are don ‟t care except for \naddress bits ADDR<10:9> ，which must be equal to \n„x1b‟. Lower address bits A DDR<3:0> define the byte \naddress inside the  UID. If the application desires to read the first byte of the UID, the lower address bits \nADDR<3:0> would need to be „0000b ‟.  \nWhen the end of the 128 -bit UID number is reached \n(16 bytes of data), the data word address will roll -over \nback to the  beginning of the 128 -bit UID number . The \nUnique ID  Read operation is terminated when the \nmicrocontroller does  not respond with a  zero (ACK) \nand instead issues a Stop condition (see Figure 16 on \npage 1 8). \nREAD SECURITY SECTOR ：Read the Security \nSector  is similar to the random read but requires use o f \ndevice address , a dummy write, and the use of specific \nword address  seen in Table 1  on page 1 2. The higher  \naddress bits ADDR< 15:7> are don ‟t care except for \naddress bits ADDR<10:9> ，which must be equal to \n„00b‟. The lower  address bits ADDR<6:0>  define the \nbyte address inside the Security Sector .  \nThe internal byte address is automatically incremented \nto the next byte address after each byte of data is \nclocked  out. When  the last byte (7Fh) is reached, it will \nroll over to 00h, the first byte of the Security Sector , \nand continue to increment.  (see Figure 13 on page \n17). \nREAD LOCK STATUS ：There are  two ways to check \nthe lock status of the Security Sector . \n1. The first way is initiat ed by a Security Sector  Write , \nthe EEPROM  will acknowledge  if the Security Sector  is \nunlocked, while it will not acknowledge  if the Security \nSector  is locked.  \nOnce the acknowledge bit is read, it is recommended \nto generate a Start  condition followed by a Stop \ncondition, so that:  \n\uf06c Start: the truncated command is not executed \nbecause the Start condition resets the  device \ninternal logic  \n\uf06c Stop: the device is then set back into Standby \nmode by the Stop condition.  \n2. The second way is initiated  by a Lock Status Read . \nLock Status Read  is similar to the random read but \nrequires use o f device address seen in Table 1  on \npage 1 2, a dummy write, and the use of specific word \naddress. The a ddress bit s ADDR<10:9>  must be „10b‟, \nall other address bits are  Don't Care. The Lock bit i s \nthe BIT1 of the byte read on SDA. It is at “1” when the \nlock is active and at “0” when the lock is not active.  \nThe same data is shifted out repeatedly until the \nmicrocontroller does not respond with a zero but does \ngenerate a following stop condition  (see Figure 15 on \npage 1 8).\n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 512D  2-Wire Serial EEPROM                   Ver.1.2                                       15  Figure 7．Byte Write   \n \n \nM\nS\nBL\nS\nBA\nC\nKA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nP WORD ADDRESS\nSDA LINES\nT\nA\nR\nT\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESSW\nR\nI\nT\nE\nL\nS\nBR\n/\nWA\nC\nKFIRST SECOND\nWORD ADDRESS\nA\nC\nKDATA\n \n \nNote: 1. * = Don’t CARE  bits \n \n \n \nFigure 8．Page Write   \n \n \nDATA (n) DATA(n+x)S\nT\nO\nP\nA\nC\nKA\nC\nKA\nC\nKSDA LINE\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESS\nL\nS\nBR\n/\nWA\nC\nKW\nR\nI\nT\nEWORD ADDRESS (n)\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nA\nR\nTFIRST SECOND\nWORD ADDRESS (n)\n \n \nNote: 1. * = Don’t CARE  bits \n \n \n \nFigure 9．Current Address Read    \n \n \nSDA LINES\nT\nA\nR\nT\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESSR\nE\nA\nD\nL\nS\nBR\n/\nWA\nC\nKDATA\nN\nO\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nP\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 512D  2-Wire Serial EEPROM                   Ver.1.2                                       16 Figure 10． Random  Read   \n \n \nR\n/\nWA\nC\nKW\nR\nI\nT\nEFIRST WORD \nADDRESS n\nSDA LINE\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESS\nL\nS\nBS\nT\nA\nR\nT\nDUMMY WRITEA\nC\nKDEVICE\nADDRESSS\nT\nA\nR\nTR\nE\nA\nD\nA\nC\nKDATA n\nN\nO\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nPSECOND WORD \nADDRESS n\nA\nC\nK\n \n \nNote: 1. * = Don’t CARE  bits. \n \n \nFigure 11． Sequential Read    \n \nSDA LINEDEVICE\nADDRESS\nR\n/\nWA\nC\nKR\nE\nA\nD DATA n DATA n+1 DATA n+2\nA\nC\nKA\nC\nKA\nC\nKN\nO\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nP DATA(n+x)\n \n \nFigure 12． Write Security Sector  \n \nA\nC\nKA\nC\nKA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nPSDA LINE\nA\nC\nK\nDATA n+1 DATA n+2 DATA n+xR\n/\nWA\nC\nKW\nR\nI\nT\nEFIRST WORD \nADDRESS n\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESS\nL\nS\nBSECOND WORD \nADDRESS n\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nA\nR\nT\n** *****\nDATA n\nA\nC\nK\n \nNote: 1. * = Don’t CARE  bits. \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 512D  2-Wire Serial EEPROM                   Ver.1.2                                       17 Figure 13． Read Security Sector  \n \nA\nC\nKA\nC\nKA\nC\nKN\nO\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nPSDA LINE\nA\nC\nKDEVICE\nADDRESSS\nT\nA\nR\nTR\nE\nA\nD\nA\nC\nK\nDATA n DATA n+1 DATA n+2 DATA n+xR\n/\nWA\nC\nKW\nR\nI\nT\nEFIRST WORD \nADDRESS n\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESS\nL\nS\nBSECOND WORD \nADDRESS n\nA\nC\nK** *****S\nT\nA\nR\nT\nDUMMY WRITE\n \nNote: 1. * = Don’t CARE  bits. \n \nFigure 14． Lock Security Sector  \n \nR\n/\nWA\nC\nKW\nR\nI\nT\nEFIRST WORD \nADDRESS n\nSDA LINE\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESS\nL\nS\nBS\nT\nA\nR\nT\nA\nC\nKSECOND WORD \nADDRESS n\nA\nC\nK** *****DATA 0\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nP\n***** **\n \nNote: 1. * = Don’t CARE  bits. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 512D  2-Wire Serial EEPROM                   Ver.1.2                                       18 Figure 15． Read Lock Status  \n \nA\nC\nKA\nC\nKN\nO\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nPSDA LINE\nA\nC\nKR\n/\nWA\nC\nKW\nR\nI\nT\nEFIRST WORD \nADDRESS n\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESS\nL\nS\nBSECOND WORD \nADDRESS n\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nA\nR\nT\nDUMMY WRITE* * ***** ***** **\nA\nC\nKLOCK BYTE LOCK BYTE LOCK BYTE LOCK BYTEDEVICE\nADDRESSS\nT\nA\nR\nTR\nE\nA\nD\nA\nC\nK\n« « « «\n \nNote: 1.  * = Don’t CARE  bits. \n      2. \uf0ab = LOCK  bits. \n \n \n \nFigure 16．Read  Unique ID    \n \nA\nC\nKA\nC\nKA\nC\nKN\nO\nA\nC\nKS\nT\nO\nPR\n/\nWA\nC\nKW\nR\nI \nT\nEFIRST WORD \nADDRESS n\nSDA LINE\nM\nS\nBDEVICE\nADDRESS\nL\nS\nBS\nT\nA\nR\nT\nDUMMY WRITEA\nC\nKDEVICE\nADDRESSS\nT\nA\nR\nTR\nE\nA\nD\nA\nC\nKSerial Number \nData 0\nA\nC\nKSECOND WORD \nADDRESS n\nA\nC\nK\nSerial Number \nData 1Serial Number \nData 2Serial Number \nData 3Serial Number \nData F* ***** * * * **\n \nNote: 1. * = Don’t CARE  bits. \n \n \n       Data Sheet  \nFM24C 512D  2-Wire Serial EEPROM                   Ver.1.2                                       19 Ordering Information   \nCompany Prefix\nProduct Family\nProduct Density\nPackage Type 1FM = Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group Co.,ltd\n24C = 2-Wire Serial EEPROM\n512 = 512K-bit\nPD = 8-pin PDIP      M2F or M2P = 8-pin Module Package  2   \nSO = 8-pin SOP        \nTS  = 8-pin TSSOP\nDN = 8-pin TDFNFM24C512-PP\nHSF ID Code 3\nBlank or R = RoHS Compliant\nG = RoHS Compliant, Halogen-free, Antimony-free-H-C\nProduct Carrier\nU = Tube\nT = Tape and Reel\nR = Module ReelD\nDevice Type\nD = with 128-bit Unique ID \n       with 128-byte Security Sector\n \n \nNote:  \n1.
