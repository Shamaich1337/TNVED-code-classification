The\nfollowing sections describe the operation of QDR-IV HP SRAM. \nClocking\nThere are three groups of clock signals: CK/CK#, DKx/DKx#,\nand QKx/QKx#, where x can be A or B, referring to the respectiveports.\nThe CK/CK# clock is associated with the address and control\npins: A[24:0], LDA#, LDB# , RWA#, RWB#. The CK/CK#\ntransitions are centered with resp ect to the address and control\nsignal transitions.\nThe DKx/DKx# clocks are associated with write data. The\nDKx/DKx# clocks are used as source-centered clocks for theDDR DQx and DINVx pins, when acting as inputs for the write\ndata.\nThe QKx/QKx# clocks are associ ated with read data. The\nQKx/QKx# clocks are used as source-synchronous clocks for\nthe DDR DQx and DINVx pins, when acting as outputs for theread data. \nCommand Cycles\nThe QDR-IV HP SRAM read and write commands are driven by\nthe control inputs (LDA#, LDB#, RWA#, and RWB#) and the\nAddress Bus.\nThe port A control inputs (LDA# and RWA#) are sampled at the\nrising  edge of the input clock. The port B control inputs (LDB#\nand RWB#) are sampled at the falling  edge of the input clock. \nFor port A:\nWhen LDA# = 0 and RWA# = 1, a read operation is initiated.When LDA# = 0 and RWA# = 0, a write operation is initiated.\nThe address is sampled on the rising  edge of the input clock. \nFor port B:\nWhen LDB# = 0 and RWB# = 1, a read operation is initiated.When LDB# = 0 and RWB# = 0, a write operation is initiated.\nThe address is sampled on the falling  edge of the input clock. \nRead and Write Data Cycles\nRead data is supplied to  the DQA pins exactly five clock cycles\nfrom the rising  edge of the CK signal, corresponding to the cycle\nwhere the read command was initiated. QVLDA is assertedone-half clock cycle prior to the fi rst data word driven on the bus.\nIt is deasserted one-half cycle prio r to the last data word driven\non the bus. Data outputs are tristated in the clock following thelast data word.\nRead data is supplied to  the DQB pins exactly five clock cycles\nfrom the falling  edge of the CK signal corresponding to the cycle\nthat the read command was initiated. QVLDB is asserted\none-half clock cycle prior to the fi rst data word driven on the bus.\nIt is deasserted one-half cycle prio r to the last data word driven\non the bus. Data outputs are tristated in the clock following the\nlast data word.Write data is supplied to the DQ A pins exactly three clock cycles\nfrom the rising  edge of the CK signal corresponding to the cycle\nwhere the write command was initiated. \nWrite data is supplied to the DQ B pins exactly three clock cycles\nfrom the falling  edge of the CK signal corresponding to the cycle\nwhere the write command was initiated. \nAddress and Data Bus Inversion\nTo reduce simultaneous switching noise and I/O current, QDR-IVHP SRAM provides the ability to invert all address or data pins.\nThe AINV pin indicates whethe r the address bus, A[24:0], and\nthe address parity bit, AP, is inverted. The address bus and parity\nbit are considered one group. The function of the AINV is\ncontrolled by the memory controller. However, the following rulesshould be used in the system design.\n■For a × 36 configuration part, 21 address pins plus 1 parity bit\nare used for 22 signals in the address group.If the number of0’s in the address group is >\n11, AINV is set to 1 by the controller.\nAs a result, no more than 11 pins may switch in the same\ndirection during each bit time. \n■For a × 18 data width part, 22 address pins plus 1 parity bit are\nused for 23 signals in the address group. If the number of 0s\nin the address group is > 12, AINV is set to 1 by the controller.\nAs a result, no more than 12 pins may switch in the same\ndirection during each bit time.\nThe DINVA and DINVB pins indicate whether the corresponding\nDQA and DQB pins are inverted.\n■For a × 36 data width part, the data bus for each port is split\ninto groups of 18 pins. Each 18-pin data group is guaranteed\nto be driving less than or equal to 10 pins low on any given\ncycle.If the number of 0’s in the data group is > 10, DINV is set\nto 1. As a result, no more than 10 pins may switch in the same\ndirection during each bit time. \n■For a × 18 data width part, the data bus for each port is split\ninto groups of nine pins. Each 9-pin data group is guaranteed\nto be driving less than or equal to five pins low on any given\ncycle. If the number of 0s  in the data group is > 5, DINV is set\nto 1. As a result, no more than five pins may switch in the same\ndirection during each bit time.\nAINV, DINVA[1:0], DINVB[1:0] are all active high. When set to 1,\nthe corresponding bus is inverted. If the data inversion feature is\nprogrammed to be OFF, then t he DINVA/DINVB output bits will\nalways be driven to 0.\nThese functions are programmable through the configuration\nregisters and can be enabled or disabled for the address bus and\nthe data bus independently.\nDuring configuration register read and write cycles, the address\ninversion input is ignored and th e data inversion output is always\ndriven to 0 when register read data is driven on the data bus.\nSpecifically, the register read da ta is driven on DQA[7:0] and the\nDINVA[0] bit is driven to 0. All other DQA/DQB data bits and\nDINVA/DINVB bits are tristated. In addition, the address parity\ninput (AP) is ignored.\nCY7C4121KV13/CY7C4141KV13\nDocument Number: 001-79343 Rev. *Q Page 10 of 45Address Parity\nThe QDR-IV HP SRAM provides an address parity feature to\nprovide integrity on the address bus. Two pins are provided to\nsupport this function: AP and PE#.\nThe AP pin is used to provide an even parity across the address\npins.The value of AP is set so that the total number of 1s\n(including the AP bit) is even. The AP pin is a DDR input.\nInternally, when an address parity error is detected, the access\nto the memory array is ignored if it was a write cycle. A read\naccess continues normally even if an address parity error is\ndetected.\nExternally, the PE# pin is used to indicate that an address parity\nerror has occurred. This pin is Active Low and is set to 0 within\nRL cycles after the address parity  error is detected. It remains\nasserted until the error is cl eared through the configuration\nregisters.\nThe address parity function is optional and can be enabled or\ndisabled in the configuration registers.\nDuring configuration register read and write cycles, the address\nparity input is ignored. Parity is not checked during these cycles.\nNote  The memory controller should generate address parity\nbased on the address bus first. Address inversion is done later\non the address bus and address parity bit. \nPort Enable\nThe QDR-IV HP SRAM has two independent bidirectional dataports. However, some system designers may either choose to\nuse only one port, or use one port as read-only and one port as\nwrite-only. \nIf a port is used in a unidirectional mode, disable the data clocks\n(DKx/DKx# or QKx/QKx#) to redu ce EMI effects in the system.\nIn addition, disable the corres ponding control input (RWx#)l. \nPort B may be programmed to be entirely disabled. If port B is\nnot used, then the following must happen:\n■The data clocks (DKB/DKB# and  QKB/QKB#) and the control\ninputs (LDB# and RWB#) must be disabled.\n■All data bus signals must be tr istated. This includes DQB,\nDINVB, and QVLDB.\n■All input signals related to port B can be left floating or tied to\neither 1 or 0 without any adverse effects on the port A operation.\n■When port B is not used, all output signals related to port B are\ninactive. \nA configuration register option is provided to specify if one of the\nports is not used or is operating in a unidirectional mode. \nOn-Die Termination (ODT) Operation \nWhen enabled, the ODT circuits for the chip will be enabledduring all NOP and write cycles. Only during read cycles is theODT temporarily disabled as the read data is driven out. Specifically, ODT is disabled one-half clock cycle before the first\nbeat of the read data is driven on the data bus and remains\ndisabled during the entire read oper ation. ODT is enabled again\none-half clock cycle after the last beat of read data is driven on\nthe data bus.\nJTAG Operation\nThe JTAG interface uses five signals, TRST#, TCK, TMS, TDI,and TDO. For normal JTAG operation, the use of TRST# is not\noptional for this device. \nWhile in the JTAG mode, the following conditions are true:\n■ODT for all pins is disabled.\nIf the JTAG function is not us ed in the system, then TRST# pin\nmust be tied to VDD and TCK input must be driven low or tied toVSS. TMS, TDI, and TDO may be left floating.\nPower-Up and Reset\nThe QDR-IV HP SRAM has specific power-up and reset\nrequirements to guarantee reliable operation. \nPower-Up Sequence\n■Apply VDD before VDDQ.\n■Apply VDDQ before VREF or at the same time as VREF.\nReset Sequence\nRefer to the reset timing diagram ( Figure 16 on page 40 ).\n1. As the power comes up, all inputs may be in an undefined \nstate, except RST# and TRST#, which must be LOW during \ntPWR.\n2. The first signal that should be driven to the device is the input\nclock (CK/CK#), which may be unstable for the duration of\ntPWR.\n3. After the input clock has stabilized, all the control inputs\nshould be driven to a valid value as follows:\na. RST# = 0b. CFG# = 1c. LBK0# = 1d. LBK1# = 1e. LDA# = 1f. LDB# = 1\n4. Reset should remain asserted, while all other control inputs\ndeasserted, for a minimu m time of 200 µs (t\nRSS).\n5. At the rising edge of reset, the address bits A[13:0] are\nsampled to load in the ODT values and Port Enable values.After reset, internal operations in the device may start. This\nmay include operations, such as PLL initialization and\nresetting internal registers.\n6. However, all external control signals must remain deasserted\nfor a minimum time of 400000 clocks (t\nRSH). During this time\nall other signals (data and address busses) should be driven\nto a valid level. All inputs to the device should be driven to avalid level.\n7. After this, the device is in the normal operating mode and\nready to respond to control inputs.\nCY7C4121KV13/CY7C4141KV13\nDocument Number: 001-79343 Rev. *Q Page 11 of 45Typically, after a reset sequence,  the system starts to perform a\ntraining sequence, involving the steps outlined in the following\nsection. \nHowever, RST# may be asserted at any time by the system and\nthe system may wish to initiate no rmal read/write op erations after\na reset sequence, without going through another trainingsequence. The chip should be able to accept normal read/write\noperations immediately following t\nRSH after the deassertion of\nRST#. \nPLL Reset Operation\nThe configuration registers contain a bit to reset the PLL.\nOperating the QDR-IV HP SRAM device without the PLLenabled is not supported – timing characteristics are not\nguaranteed when the PLL is disabled. However, this bit is\nintended to allow the system to reset the P LL locking circuitry.\nResetting the PLL is accomplished by first programming the PLL\nReset bit to 1 to disable the PLL, and then programming the bitto 0 to enable the PLL. After these steps, the PLL will relock to\nthe input clock. A wait time of t\nPLL is required. \nOperation Modes\nThe QDR-IV HP SRAM has three unique modes of operation:\n1. Configuration\n2. Loopback3. Memory Access\nThese modes are defined by the level of the control signals\nCFG#, LBK0#, LBK1#, LDA#, LDB#. \nIt is intended that these operati ons are mutually exclusive. In\nother words, one operation mode cannot be performed\nsimultaneously with another operation mode. \nThere is no priority given  for inadvertently a sserting the control\nsignals at the wrong time. The internal chip behavior is not\ndefined for improper control signal assertion. The system muststrictly adhere to proper mode transitions, as defined in the\nfollowing sections, for proper device operation. \nConfiguration\nA configuration operation mode is entered when the CFG# signal\nis asserted. Memory Access or Loopback operations should not\nbe performed for a minimum of 32 clocks prior to entering this\nmode.\nWhile in this mode, the control signals LDB#, LBK0#, and LBK1#\nmust not be asserted. However, LDA# is used to perform the\nactual Register Read and Write operations. \nMemory Access or Loopback operations should not be\nperformed for a minimum of 32 cl ocks after exiting this mode. \nLoopback\nA loopback operation mode is entered when the LBK0# and/or\nLBK1# signals are asserted. Me mory Access or Configuration\noperations should not be performed for a minimum of 32 clocksprior to entering this mode.\nJust after entering this mode , an additional 32 clocks are\nrequired before the part is ready to accept toggling valid inputsfor training.\nWhile in this mode, LDA# and LDB# may be toggled for training.Memory Access or Configurat ion operations should not be\nperformed for a minimum of 32 cl ocks after exiting this mode.\nData inversion is not used during the Loopback mode. Even if\nthe configuration register has this feature enabled, it is\ntemporarily ignored during the Loopback mode. \nMemory Access\nIf the control signals CFG#, LBK0#, and LBK1# are not asserted,\nthen the device is in the Memo ry Access mode. This mode is the\nnormal operating mode of the device.\nWhile in this mode, a memory access cycle is performed when\nthe LDA# and/or LDB# signals are asserted. The control signalsCFG#, LBK0#, and LBK1# must not be asserted when\nperforming a memory access cycle.\nA memory access should not be performed for a minimum of\n32 clocks prior to leaving this mode.\nDeskew Training Sequence\nThe QDR-IV HP SRAM provides support that allows a memory\ncontroller to deskew signals for high-speed operation. Thememory controller provides the deskew function, if deskew is\ndesired. During the deskew operation, the QDR-IV HP SRAM\noperates in a loopback mode. \nRefer to the loopback timing diagram ( Figure 15 on page 39 ).\nDeskew is achieved in three steps: \n1. Control/address deskew\n2. Read data deskew3. Write data deskew\nControl/Address Deskew\nAssert LBK0# to 0 and/or LBK1# to 0The following 39 signals are looped back:\n■DKA0, DKA0#, DKA1, DKA1#\n■DKB0, DKB0#, DKB1, DKB1#\n■LDA#, RWA#, LDB#, RWB#\n■A[24:0], AINV, AP\nThe clock inputs DKA0, DKA0#,  DKA1#, DKB0, DKB0#, DKB1,\nand DKB1# are free-running clock inputs and should becontinuously running during the training sequence. In addition, a\nwait time of t\nPLL is needed.\nRefer to Table 1 on page 14  for the loopback signal mapping.\nFor each pin that is looped back, the input pin is sampled on both\nthe rising and falling edges using the input clock (CK/CK#).\nThe value output on the rising edge of the output clock\n(QKA/QKA#) will be the value that was sampled on the rising\nedge of the input clock.\nThe value output on the falling edge of the output clock\n(QKA/QKA#) will be the inverted value that was sampled on the\nfalling edge of the input clock.\nThe delay from the input pins to the DQA outputs is tLBL, which\nis 16 clocks. \nCY7C4121KV13/CY7C4141KV13\nDocument Number: 001-79343 Rev. *Q Page 12 of 45Read Data Deskew\nAt this time, the address, cont rol, and data input clocks are\nalready deskewed.\nRead data deskew requires a training pattern to be written into\nthe memory, using data held at constant values. \nComplex data patterns may be writ ten into the memory using the\nnon deskewed DQA and/or DQB signals and the write trainingenable bit. \nWrite training enable set to 1:\nDuring Write Data Cycles:\nThe First Data Beat (First Data Burst) is sampled from the data\nbus.The Second Data Beat (Second Data Burst) is the inverted\nsample from the data bus.\nWrite training enable set to 0:\nDuring Write Data Cycles:\nBoth First and Second Data Beats are sampled from the databus, which is the normal operation.\nThe Write Training Enable bit has no effect on read data cycles.After the data pattern is written into the memory, standard read\ncommands permit the system to deskew with respect to the\nQK/QK# data output clocks the following signals:\nDQA, DINVA, QVLDA, DQB, DINVB, QVLDB\nWrite Data Deskew\nWrite data deskew is performed using write commands to the\nmemory followed by read commands.\nThe deskewed read data path is used to determine whether or\nnot the write data was received correctly by the device.\nThis permits the syste m to deskew with respect to the DK/DK#\ninput data clocks the following signals:\nDQA, DINVA, DQB, DINVB \nI/O Signaling Standards\nSeveral I/O signaling standards are supported by the QDR-IV HP\nSRAM, which are programmable by the user. They are:\n■1.2 V and 1.25 V HSTL/SSTL\n■1.1 V and 1.2 V POD\nThe I/O Signaling Standard is programmed on the rising edge of\nreset by sampling the address bus inputs. Once programmed,\nthe value cannot be changed. Only the rising edge of anotherreset can change the value.\nAll address, control, and data I/O signals — with the exception\nof six pins (listed as LVCMOS in the LVCMOS Signaling ) — will\nprogram to comply with HSTL/SSTL or POD.HSTL/SSTL Signaling\nHSTL/SSTL is supported at the V\nDDQ voltages of 1.2 V and\n1.25 -V nominal.\nThe ODT termination values can be set to:\n■40, 60, or 120 ohms with a 220-ohm reference resistor\n■50 or 100 ohms with a 180-ohm reference resistor\nThe drive strength can be programmed to:\n■40 or 60 ohms with a 220- ohm reference resistor\n■50 ohms with a 180-ohm reference resistor\nA reference resistor of 180 ohms  or 220 ohms is supported with\nHSTL/SSTL signaling. \nPOD Signaling\nPOD is supported at VDDQ voltages of 1.1 V and 1.2 V nominal.\nThe ODT termination values can be set to:\n■50 or 100 ohms with a 180-ohm reference resistor\n■60 or 120 ohms with a 220-ohm reference resistor\nThe drive strength can be programmed to:\n■50 ohms with a 180-ohm reference resistor\n■40 or 60 ohms with a 220- ohm reference resistor\nA reference resistor of 180 ohms  or 220 ohms is supported with\nPOD signaling. \nLVCMOS Signaling\nSix I/O signals are permanently set to use LVCMOS signaling at\nvoltage of 1.3 V nominal. These signals are referenced to thecore voltage supply, V\nDD. They are: \nRST#, TRST#, TCK, TMS, TDI, and TDOAll the five JTAG signals as well as the main reset input are 1.3 V\nLVCMOS.\nIn addition, ODT is disabled at all times on these LVCMOS\nsignals. \nInitialization\nThe QDR-IV HP SRAM must be initialized before it can operate\nin the normal functional mode.

A ll registers are 8-bits wide. The\nwrite operation is performed using only the address pins to\ndefine the register address and register write data. For a read\noperation, the regist er read data is provided on the data port A\noutput pins. Refer to Figure 14 on page 38  for programming\ndetails.\nDuring the rising edge of RST#, the Address pins A[13:0] are\nsampled. The value sampled beco mes the reset value of certain\nbits in the registers defined in Table 2 . This is used to set\ntermination, impedance, and port configuration values\nimmediately upon reset. These values can be overwritten later\nthrough a register write operation.\nWhen a parity error occurs, the complete address of the first\nerror is recorded in Registers 4,  5, 6, and 7 along with the port\nA/B error bit. The port A/B error bit indicates which port the\naddress parity error came from — 0 for port A and 1 for port B.\nThis information remains latched until cleared by writing a 1 tothe address parity error clear bit in register 3.\nTwo counters are used to indicate if multiple address parity errors\nhave occurred. Port A error count is a running count of the\nnumber of parity errors on port A addresses, and similarly port B\nerror count is a running count of the number of parity errors onport B addresses. They will each independently count to a\nmaximum value of 3 and then st op counting. These counters are\nfree-running and they are both reset by writing a 1 to the addressparity error clear bit in register 3. \nConfiguration Registers Description\nConfiguration Register DefinitionsTable 1.

This part is fully\ncompliant with IEEE Standard #11 49.1-2001. In the JTAG mode,\nthe ODT feature for all pins is disabled.\nIf the JTAG function is not used in the circuit, then the TCK inputs\nmust be driven low or tied to VSS. TRST#, TMS, TDI, and TDOmay be left floating. An internal  pull-up resistor is implemented\non the TRST#, TMS, and TDI i nputs to ensure that these inputs\nare HIGH during t\nPWR.\nTest Access Port\nTest Clock (TCK)\nThe test clock is used only with the TAP controller. All inputs are\ncaptured on the rising edge of TC K. All outputs are driven from\nthe falling edge of TCK.\nTest Mode Select (TMS)\nThe TMS input is used to give commands to the TAP controller\nand is sampled on the rising edge of TCK. This pin may be left\nunconnected if the TAP is not  used. The pin is pulled up\ninternally, resulting in a logic HIGH level.\nTest Data-In (TDI)\nThe TDI pin is used to serially input information into the registers\nand can be connected to the input of any of the registers. The\nregister between TDI and TDO is chosen by the instruction that\nis loaded into the TAP instruction register. For information onloading the instruction register, see TAP Controller State\nDiagram on page 21 . TDI is internally pulled up and can be\nunconnected if the TAP is unus ed in an application. TDI is\nconnected to the most signific ant bit (MSB) on any register.\nTest Data-Out (TDO)\nThe TDO output pin is used to serially clock data out from the\nregisters. The output is active, depending upon the current state\nof the TAP state machine (see Instruction Codes on page 25 ).\nThe output changes on the falling edge of TCK. TDO is\nconnected to the least significant bit (LSB) of any register.\nTest Reset (TRST#)\nThe TRST# input pin is used to reset the TAP controller.Alternatively, a reset may be performed by forcing TMS HIGH\n(V\nDD) for five rising edges of TCK. \nThis reset does not affect the operation of the SRAM and can be\nperformed while the SRAM is oper ating. At power up, the TAP is\nreset internally to ensure that TDO comes up in a high Z state.\nTAP Registers\nRegisters are connected between the TDI and TDO pins to scanthe data in and out of the SRAM te st circuitry. Only one register\ncan be selected at a time through  the instruction registers. Data\nis serially loaded into the TDI pin on the rising edge of TCK. Datais output on the TDO pin on the falling edge of TCK.Instruction Register\nThree-bit instructions can be serially loaded into the instruction\nregister. This register is loaded when it is placed between the TDI\nand TDO pins, as shown in TAP Controller Block Diagram on\npage 22 . Upon power up, the instruction register is loaded with\nthe IDCODE instruction. It is also loaded with the IDCODEinstruction if the controller is pl aced in a RST state, as described\nin the previous section.\nWhen the TAP controller is in th e Capture-IR state, the two least\nsignificant bits are loaded with a binary “01” pattern to allow for\nfault isolation of the board level serial test path.\nBypass Register\nTo save time when serially shifting data through registers, it is\nsometimes advantageous to skip certain chips. The bypassregister is a single-bit register that can be placed between TDI\nand TDO pins. This enables shifting of data through the SRAM\nwith minimal delay. The bypass register is set LOW (VSS) whenthe BYPASS instruction is executed.\nBoundary Scan Register\nThe boundary scan register is connected to all of the input and\noutput pins on the SRAM. Several No Connect (NC) pins are also\nincluded in the scan register to reserve pins for higher density\ndevices.\nThe boundary scan register is loaded with the contents of the\nRAM input and output ring when the TAP controller is in theCapture-DR state and is then placed between the TDI and TDO\npins when the controller is moved to the Shift-DR state. The\nEXTEST, SAMPLE/PRELOAD, and SA MPLE Z instructions can\nbe used to capture the contents of the input and output ring.\nBoundary Scan Order on page 26  shows the order in which the\nbits are connected. Each bit corresponds to one of the bumps on\nthe SRAM package. The MSB of the register is connected to TDI,\nand the LSB is connected to TDO.\nIdentification (ID) Register\nThe ID register is loaded with a vendor-specific, 32-bit code\nduring the Capture-DR state when the IDCODE command is\nloaded in the instruction register . The IDCODE is hardwired into\nthe SRAM and can be shifted out when the TAP controller is in\nthe Shift-DR state. The ID regist er has a vendor code and other\ninformation described in Identification Register Definitions on\npage 25 .\nTAP Instruction Set\nEight different instructions ar e possible with the three-bit\ninstruction register. All co mbinations are listed in Instruction\nCodes on page 25 . Three of these instru ctions are listed as\nRESERVED and must not be used. The other five instructions\nare described in this section in detail.\nInstructions are loaded into the TAP controller during the Shift-IR\nstate when the instruction register is placed between TDI andTDO. During this state, instructions are shifted through theinstruction register through the TDI and TDO pins. To execute\nthe instruction after it is shift ed in, the TAP controller must be\nmoved into the Update-IR state.\nCY7C4121KV13/CY7C4141KV13\nDocument Number: 001-79343 Rev. *Q Page 20 of 45IDCODE\nThe IDCODE instruction loads a vendor-specific, 32-bit code into\nthe instruction register. It also  places the instruction register\nbetween the TDI and TDO pins and shifts the IDCODE out of the\ndevice when the TAP controller enters the Shift-DR state. TheIDCODE instruction is loaded into the instruction register atpower up or whenever the TAP controller is supplied a\nTest-Logic-RST state.\nSAMPLE Z\nThe SAMPLE Z instruction connects the boundary scan register\nbetween the TDI and TDO pins when the TAP controller is in a\nShift-DR state. The SAMPLE Z command puts the output businto a High Z state until the next command is supplied during the\nUpdate IR state. Both Port A and Port B are enabled once this\ncommand has been executed.\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD is a 1149.1 mandatory instruction. When\nthe SAMPLE/PRELOAD instructions are loaded into theinstruction register and the TAP controller is in the Capture-DR\nstate, a snapshot of data on the input and output pins is captured\nin the boundary scan register.\nRemember that the TAP controller  clock can only operate at a\nfrequency up to 20 MHz, while the SRAM clock operates morethan an order of magnitude faster. Because there is a large\ndifference in the clock frequencies, it is possible that an input or\noutput undergoes a transition during the Capture-DR state. The\nTAP may then try to capture a signal while in transition\n(metastable state). This does not harm the device but there is no\nguarantee as to the value that is captured. Repeatable resultsmay not be possible.\nTo guarantee that the boundary scan register captures the\ncorrect value of a signal, the SRAM signal must be stabilized\nlong enough to meet the TAP cont roller’s capture setup plus hold\ntimes (t\nCS and tCH). The SRAM clock input  might not be captured\ncorrectly if there is no way in a de sign to stop (or slow) the clock\nduring a SAMPLE/PRELOAD instructi on. If this is an issue, it is\nstill possible to capture all other signals and simply ignore thevalue of the CK and CK\n captured in the boundary scan register.\nAfter the data is captured, it is possible to shift out the data by\nputting the TAP into the Shift-DR  state. This places the boundary\nscan register between the TDI and TDO pins.\nPRELOAD places an initial data pattern at the latched parallel\noutputs of the boundary scan register cells before the selection\nof another boundary scan test operation.The shifting of data for the SAMPLE and PRELOAD phases can\noccur concurrently when requir ed, that is, while the data\ncaptured is shifted out, the pr eloaded data can be shifted in.\nBYPASS\nWhen the BYPASS instruction is loaded in the instruction register\nand the TAP is placed in a Shift- DR state, the bypass register is\nplaced between the TDI and TDO pins. The advantage of theBYPASS instruction is that it shortens the boundary scan path\nwhen multiple devices are connected together on a board.\nEXTEST\nThe EXTEST instruction drives  the preloaded data out through\nthe system output pins. This instruction also connects the\nboundary scan register for serial access between the TDI andTDO in the Shift-DR controller stat e. Both Port A and Port B are\nenabled after this command is executed.\nEXTEST OUTPUT BUS TRISTATE\nIEEE Standard 1149.1 mandates that the TAP controller be able\nto put the output bus into a tristate mode.\nThe boundary scan register has output enable control bits\nlocated at Bit #49 and Bit #50. Bit# 49 enables the output pins\nfor DQB and Bit#50 enables DQA and PE# pins. \nWhen these scan cells, called the “extest output bus tristate”, are\nlatched into the preload register during the Update-DR state inthe TAP controller, they directly  control the state of the output\n(Q-bus) pins, when the EXTEST is entered as the current\ninstruction. When HIGH, it enables the output buffers to drive the\noutput bus. When LOW, this bi t places the output bus into a\nHigh Z condition.\nThese bits can be set by entering the SAMPLE/PRELOAD or\nEXTEST command, and then shifting the desired bit into that cell,\nduring the Shift-DR state. During Update-DR, the value loadedinto that shift-register cell latc hes into the preload register. When\nthe EXTEST instruction is entered, th ese bits directly controls the\noutput Q-bus pins. Note that these bits are pre-set LOW to\ndisable the output when the device is powered up, and also when\nthe TAP controller is in the Test-Logic-RST state. \nReserved\nThese instructions are not im plemented but are reserved for\nfuture use. Do not use these instructions. \nCY7C4121KV13/CY7C4141KV13\nDocument Number: 001-79343 Rev. *Q Page 21 of 45TAP Controller State Diagram\nFigure 4.
