The device is fabricated with advanced CMOStechnology to achieve ultra −high speed with high output drive while\nmaintaining low static power dissipation over a very broad V\nCC\noperating range. The device is specified to operate over the 1.65 V to5.5 V V\nCC range. The inputs and outputs are high impedance when\nVCC is 0 V . Inputs tolerate voltages up to 5.5 V independent of V CC\noperating voltage.\nFeatures\n•Ultra−High Speed: t PD = 2.4 ns (Typical) into 50 pF at 5 V V CC\n•High Output Drive: ±24 mA at 3 V V CC\n•Broad V CC Operating Range: 1.65 V to 5.5 V\n•Matches Performance of LCX when Operated at 3.3 V V CC\n•Power Down High −Impedance Inputs / Outputs\n•Over−V oltage Tolerance Inputs Facilitate 5 V to 3 V Translation\n•Proprietary Noise / EMI Reduction Circuitry\n•Ultra−Small MicroPak ™ Packages\n•Space−Saving SC −88 Package\n•These Devices are Pb −Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free and are RoHS\nCompliant\nFigure 1.
