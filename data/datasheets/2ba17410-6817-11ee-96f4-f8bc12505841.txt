The device can be used as either an image reject mixer or a single sideband upconverter. The mixer uses two standard double balanced mixer cells and a 90° hybrid fabricated in a GaAs, metal \nsemiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET) process. The \nHMC520A  is a smaller alternative to a hybrid style image reject \nmixer and a single sideband upconverter assembly. The HMC520A  eliminates the need for wire bonding, allowing the \nuse of surface-mount manufacturing techniques. \n \nHMC520A Data Sheet\n \nRev.

A | Page 25 of 32 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe HMC520A  is a GaAs, MMIC, I/Q mixer in a 24-terminal, \nRoHS compliant, ceramic LCC package and operates over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range. The \nEV1HMC520ALC4  \nevaluation board is also available from Analog Devices, Inc. The \nHMC520A  is a passive, wideband, I/Q MMIC mixer that can be \nused as either an image reject mixer for receiver operations or as a single sideband upconverter for transmitter operations. The mixer uses two standard double balanced mixer cells and a 90° hybrid \nfabricated in the GaAs, MESFET process. \nWith an RF and an LO input frequency range of 6 GHz to 10 GHz \nand an IF frequency range of dc to 3.5 GHz, the HMC520A  is ideal \nfor applications requiring a wide frequency range, excellent RF \nperformance, a simple design with fewer components, and a small PCB footprint. One HMC520A  can replace multiple \nnarrow-band mixers in a design. The HMC520A  eliminates the need for wire bonding, allowing the use of the surface-mount \nmanufacturing techniques. \nThe inherent I/Q architecture of the HMC520A  offers excellent \nimage rejection and thereby eliminates the need for expensive filtering for unwanted sidebands. The double balanced architecture of the mixer also provides excellent LO to RF isolation and LO to IF \nisolation, and this architecture reduces the effect of LO leakage \nto ensure signal integrity. Because the HMC520A  is a passive \nmixer, the HMC520A  does not require any dc power sources. \nThe HMC520A  offers a lower noise figure compared to an \nactive mixer, ensuring superior dynamic range for high performance and precision applications. \nFor both upconversion and down conversion, an external 90° \nhybrid is required. See the Applications Information section for \ndetails on interfacing with this external 90° hybrid. \n \n \nHMC520A Data Sheet\n \nRev. A | Page 26 of 32 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nFigure 83 shows the typical application circuit for the HMC520A . \nTo select the appropriate sideband, an external 90° hybrid is needed. For applications not requiring operation to dc, use an off chip dc blocking capacitor. For applications that require the \nLO signal at the output to be suppressed, use a bias tee or RF \nfeed as shown in Figure 83. Ensure that the source or sink current used for LO suppression is <12 mA for each IF port to prevent damage to the device. The common-mode voltage for \neach IF port is 0 V . \nTo select the upper sideband when using as an upconverter, \nconnect the IF1 pin to the 90° port of the hybrid and connect \nthe IF2 pin to the 0° port of the hybrid. To select the lower \nsideband, connect the IF1 pin to the 0° port of the hybrid and connect the IF2 pin to the 90° port of the hybrid. The input is from the sum port of the hybrid, and the difference port is 50 Ω \nterminated. \nTo select the upper sideband (low-side LO) when using as a \ndownconverter, connect the IF1 pin to the 0° port of the hybrid \nand connect the IF2 pin to the 90° port of the hybrid. To select \nthe lower sideband (high-side LO), connect the IF1 pin to the 90° port of the hybrid and connect the IF2 pin to the 0° port of the hybrid. The output is from the sum port of the hybrid, and \nthe difference port is 50 Ω terminated. \n13605-084131\n3\n4275\n61415161718 90°\nHYBRID\nRF LO89101112\n19\nIF1 IF2\n2021222324\n50Ω IFSUPPLY\nFOR IF1SUPPLY\nFOR IF2BIAS TEE/\nDC FEED FOR IF2BIAS TEE/\nDC FEED FOR IF1 DC BLOCKING\nCAPACITORS\nEXTERNAL\n90° HYBRID\nNOTES\n1.
