The ADCMP580  features CML output drivers, the ADCMP581  \nfeatures reduced swing ECL (negative ECL) output drivers, and the ADCMP582  features reduced swing PECL (positive ECL) \noutput drivers. \nAll three comparators offer 180 ps propagation delay and 100 ps \nminimum pulse width for 10 Gbps operation with 200 fs random \njitter (RJ). Overdrive and slew rate dispersion are typically less \nthan 15 ps. \nThe ±5 V power supplies enable a wide −2 V to +3 V input \nrange with logic levels referenced to the CML/NECL/PECL outputs. The inputs have 50 Ω on-chip termination resistors with the optional capability to be left open (on an individual  \npin basis) for applications requiring high impedance input. The CML output stage is designed to directly drive 400 mV into \n50 Ω transmission lines terminated to ground. The NECL output \nstages are designed to directly drive 400 mV into 50 Ω terminated to −2 V . The PECL output stages are designed to directly drive 400 mV into 50 Ω terminated to V\nCCO − 2 V . High speed latch \nand programmable hysteresis are also provided. The differential latch input controls are also 50 Ω terminated to an independent V\nTT pin to interface to either CML or ECL or to PECL logic.  \nThe ADCMP580 /ADCMP581 /ADCMP582  are available in a \n16-lead LFCSP .  \n \n \nADCMP580/ADCMP581/ADCMP582  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

B | Page 12 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nPOWER/GROUND LAYOUT AND BYPASSING  \nThe ADCMP580 /ADCMP581 /ADCMP582  family of  comparators \nis designed for very high speed applications.  Consequently, high \nspeed design techniques must be used to achieve the specified \nperformance. It is critically important to use low imped ance \nsupply planes, particularly for the negative supply (V EE), the \noutput supply plane (V CCO), and the ground plane (GND). \nIndividual supply planes are recommended as part of a multilayer \nboard. Provid ing the lowest inductance return path for the \nswitchi ng currents ensures the best possible performance in the \ntarget application.  \nIt is also important to adequately bypass the input and output supplies. A 1 µF electrolytic bypass capacitor must  be placed \nwithin several inches of each power supply pin to grou nd. In \naddition, multiple high quality 0.1 µF bypass capacitors must  be \nplaced as close as possible to each of the V\nEE, VCCI, and  VCCO \nsupply pins and must  be connected to the GND plane with \nredundant vias. High frequency bypass capacitors must  be \ncarefully selected for minimum inductance and ESR. Parasitic layout inductance must  be strictly avoided to maximize the \neffectiveness of the bypass at high frequencies.  \nADCMP580/ ADCMP581/ ADCMP582  FAMILY OF \nOUTPUT STAGES  \nSpecified propagation delay dispersion performance is achieved \nby using p roper transmission line terminations. The outputs of \nthe ADCMP580 family comparators are designed to directly \ndrive 400 m V into 50 Ω  cable or microstrip/stripline transmis -\nsion lines terminated with 50  Ω referenced to the proper return. \nThe CML output  stage for the ADCMP580 is shown in the \nsimplified schematic diagram in Figure 23. Each output is back -\nterminated with 50 Ω  for best transmission line matching. The \noutputs of the ADCMP581/ ADCMP582 are illustrated in \nFigure  24; they must  be terminated to −2 V for E CL outputs of \nADCMP581  and V CCO − 2 V for PECL o utputs of ADCMP582. As \nan alter native, Thevenin equivalent termination networks can  \nalso be used. If these high speed signals must be routed more \nthan a centimeter, either microstrip or stripline techniques  are \nrequired to ensure proper transition times and to prevent \nexcessive output ringing and pulse width -dependent propagation  \ndelay dispersion.

Simplified Schematic Diagram of the  \nADCMP581 /ADCMP582  ECL/PECL Output Stage  \nUSING/DISABLING THE LATCH FEATURE  \nThe latch inputs (LE/ LE) are active low for latch mode and are \ninternally terminated with 50 Ω  resistors to the V TT pin. When \nusing the ADCMP580, V TT must  be connected to ground. When \nusing the ADCMP581 , V TT must  be connected to −2  V . When \nusing the ADCMP582 , V TT must  be connected externally  to V CCO \n− 2 V , preferably with its own low inductance plane.  \nWhen using the ADCMP580, the latch function can be disabled \nby connecting the LE pin to V EE with an external pull -down \nresistor and by leaving the LE pin to g roun d. To prevent excessive  \npower dissipa tion, the resistor must  be 1 kΩ for the ADCMP580. \nWhen using the ADCMP581 comparators, the latch can be \ndisabled by connecting the LE pin to VEE with an external 7 50 Ω \nresistor and leaving the LE  pin connected to − 2 V.  The idea is to \ncreate an approximate 0.5 V  offset using the internal resistor a s \nhalf of the voltage divider. Connect the  VTT pin as  recommended.  \nData Sheet ADCMP580/ADCMP581/ADCMP582\n \nRev. B | Page 13 of 16 OPTIMIZING HIGH SPEED PERFORMANCE \nAs with any high speed comparator, proper design and layout \ntechniques are essential to obtaining the specified performance. \nStray capacitance, inductance, inductive power, and ground impedances or other layout issues can severely limit performance \nand can cause oscillation. Discontinuities along input and output \ntransmission lines can also severely limit the specified pulse \nwidth dispersion performance. \nFor applications in a 50 Ω environment, input and output \nmatching have a significant impact on data-dependent (or deterministic) jitter (DJ) and pulse width dispersion performance. The ADCMP580 /ADCMP581 /ADCMP582  \nfamily of comparators provides internal 50 Ω termination \nresistors for both V\nP and V N inputs. The return side for each \ntermination is pinned out separately with the V TP and V TN pins, \nrespectively. If a 50 Ω termination is desired at one or both of \nthe V P/V N inputs, the V TP and V TN pins can be connected (or \ndisconnected) to (from) the desired termination potential as \nappropriate. The termination potential must be carefully \nbypassed using ceramic capacitors as discussed previously to prevent undesired aberrations on the input signal due to parasitic inductance in the termination return path. If a 50 Ω termination is not desired, either one or both of the V\nTP/VTN termination pins \ncan be left disconnected. In this case, the open pins must be left \nfloating with no external pull downs or bypassing capacitors. \nFor applications that require high speed operation but do not \nhave on-chip 50 Ω termination resistors, some reflections must be expected, because the comparator inputs can no longer provide matched impedance to the input trace leading up to the device. It then becomes important to back-match the drive \nsource impedance to the input transmission path leading to the \ninput to minimize multiple reflections. For applications in which the comparator is less than 1 cm from the driving signal source, the source impedance must be minimized. High source impedance in combination with parasitic input capacitance of \nthe comparator could cause undesirable degradation in \nbandwidth at the input, thus degrading the overall response. It is therefore recommended that the drive source impedance be no \nmore than 50 Ω for best high speed performance. COMPARATOR PROPAGATION DELAY DISPERSION \nThe ADCMP580 /ADCMP581 /ADCMP582  family of comparators \nhas been specifically designed to reduce propagation delay dis-\npersion over a wide input overdrive range of 5 mV to 500 mV . Propagation delay dispersion is a change in propagation delays that \nresults from a change in the degree of overdrive or slew rate (how \nfar or how fast the input signal exceeds the switching threshold). \nThe overall result is a higher degree of timing accuracy. \nPropagation delay dispersion is a specification that becomes \nimportant in critical timing applications, such as data commu-nications, automatic test and measurement, instrumentation, and event-driven applications, such as pulse spectroscopy, nuclear instrumentation, and medical imaging. Dispersion is \ndefined as the variation in the overall propagation delay as the \ninput overdrive conditions are changed (see Figure 25 and Figure 26). For the ADCMP580 /ADCMP581 /ADCMP582  \nfamily of comparators, dispersion is typically <25 ps, because the overdrive varies from 5 mV to 500 mV , and the input slew \nrate varies from 1 V/ns to 10 V/ns. This specification applies for \nboth positive and negative signals because the ADCMP580 /ADCMP581 /ADCMP582  family of comparators \nhas almost equal delays for positive- and negative-going inputs.  \nQ/Q OUTPUTINPUT VOLTAGE500mV OVERDRIV E\n5mV OVERDRIVE\nDISPERSIONVN ± VOS\n04672-026 \nFigure 25.

B | Page 14 of 16 COMPARATOR HYSTERESI S \nAdding hysteresis to a comparator is often  desirable in a noisy \nenvironment or when the differential inputs are very small or \nslow moving. The transfer function for a comparator with  hystere -\nsis is shown in Figure  27. If the input voltage approaches the \nthreshold from the negative direction, the comparator switches \nfrom a low to a high when the input crosses +V H/2. The new \nswitching threshold becomes − VH/2. The comparator remains \nin the high state until the threshold − VH/2 is crossed from the \npositive direction. In this manner, noise centered on 0  V input \ndoes not cause the comparator to switch states unless it exceeds the region bounded by ±V\nH/2. \nThe custo mary technique for introducing hysteresis into a \ncomparator uses positive feedback from the output back to the  \ninput. A limitation of this approach is that the amount of hysteresis varies with the output logic levels, resulting in hysteresis that is not sy mmetric about the threshold. The external feedback  \nnetwork can also introduce significant parasitics that reduce \nhigh speed performance and can even reduce overall stability in some cases.  \nOUTPUTINPUT0V\n01+VH\n2–VH\n2\n04672-028 \nFigure 27. Comparator Hysteresis Transfer Function  \nThe ADCMP580/ ADCMP581/ ADCMP582 family of \ncomparators offers a programmable hysteresis feature that can \nsignificantly improve the accuracy and stability of the desired \nhysteresis. By connecting an external pull -down resistor from \nthe HYS pin to V EE, a variable amount of hysteres is can be \napplied. Leaving the HYS pin disconnected disables the feature,  \nand hysteresis is then less than 1 mV , as specified. The \nmaximum range of hysteresis that can be applied by using this  \nmethod is approximately ± 70 m V.   \nFigure 28 illustrates the amount of applied hysteresis as a \nfunction of the external resistor value. The advantage of \napplying hysteresis in this manner is improved accuracy, stability, and reduced component count. An external bypass capacitor is not required on the HYS pin , and it would likely \ndegrade the jitter performance of the device.  The hysteresis pin can  also be driven by a current source.  \nIt is biased approximately  400 mV above V\nEE and has an  \ninternal series resistance of approximately 600 Ω.  \n80\n0\n1 10k\nRHYS CONTRO L RESIS TOR (Ω)COM PARATOR HYSTERESIS (mV)70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n10 100 1k\n04672-029 \nFigure 28. Comparator Hysteresis vs. R HYS Control Resistor  \nMINIMUM INPUT SLEW R ATE REQUIREMENT  \nAs with many high speed comparators, a minimum slew rate requirement must be met to ensure that the device does not oscillate as the input signal crosses the threshold. This oscil -\nlation is due in part to the high input bandwidth of the comparator  \nand the feedback parasitics inherent in the package. A \nminimum slew rate of 50 V/µs must  ensure clean output \ntransitions from the ADCMP580 /ADCMP581 /ADCMP582 \nfamily of comparators.  \nThe slew rate may be too slow for other reasons. The extremely \nhigh bandwidth of these devices means that broadband noise can be a significant factor when input slew rates are low. There \nis 120 μ V of thermal noise generated over the bandwidth of the \ncomparator by the two 50 Ω terminations at room temperature. \nWith a slew rate of only 50 V/ μs, the inputs are  inside this noise \nband for over 2 ps, rendering the comparator’s jitter performance  of \n200 fs irrelevant. Raising the slew rate of the input signal and/or reducing the bandwidth over which that resistance is seen at the \ninput can greatly reduce jitter. Devices are not charact erize d this \nway but simply bypassing a reference input close to the package \ncan reduce jitter 30% in low slew rate applications.  \n \nData Sheet  ADCMP580/ADCMP581/ADCMP582  \n \nRev.
