All RS -232 inputs and outputs a re protected to ± 15kV using the \nIEC 61000 -4-2 Air -Gap Discharge method, ± 8kV using the IEC 61000 -4-2 Contact Discharge \nmethod, and ±8kV using the  Human -Body Model.  The charge pump requires five small 0.1 μF \ncapacitors for operation from as low as a 1.8 V supply. The UM3122 EEQA is capable of running \nat data  rates up to 1000 kbps, while maintaining RS -232 compatible output levels.  The \nUM3122 EEQA has a unique V L pin that allows  operation in mixed -logic voltage  systems.  Both \ndriver  in (D IN) and receiver out (R OUT) logic levels are pin  programmable through the V L pin. This \neliminates the  need for additional voltage level shifter while  interfacing with low -voltage \nmicrocontrollers or  UARTs.  Auto Powerdown Plus aut omaticall y places the  device in a low \npower mode when the device has not  received or transmitted data for more than 30  seconds. This \nfeature makes this device a very  attractive option for battery powered or other power  sensitive  \napplications.  \n \nApplications   \n  \nFeatur es  \n \n⚫ Remote Radio Unit (RRU)  \n⚫ Base Band Unit (BBU)  \n⚫ Electronic Point of Sale (EPOS)  \n⚫ Diagnostics & Data Transmission  \n⚫ Battery -Powered Equipment  ⚫ Extended V CC operating nodes: 1.8 V, 3.3 V, or  \n5.0V \n–Unique Tripler Charge Pump Architecture  \nEnables Low VCC of 1. 8V While \nMaintaining  Compatibility with 3.3 V and \n5V Supplies  \n⚫ Integrated Level -Shifting Functionality \nEliminates  the Need for External Power or \nAdditional Level  Shifter While Interfacing \nwith Low -Voltage MCUs  \n⚫ Enhanced ESD Protection on R IN Inputs  and \nDOUT Outputs  \n– ±15kV IEC 61000 -4-2 Air -Gap Discharge  \n– ±8kV IEC 61000 -4-2 Contact Discharge  \n– ±8kV Human -Body Model  \n⚫ Specified 1000  kbps Data Rate  \n⚫ Auto Powerdown Plus Feature  \n⚫ Low 0.5uA Shutdown Supply Current  \n⚫ Meets or Exceeds Compatibility  Requirements \nof RS-232 Interface  \n \n                                                                                          \n________________________________________________________________________  \nhttp://www .union -ic.com  Rev.02 Nov.2021                                     2/19 \nUM3122 EEQA\nA Ordering Information  \n \nPart Number  Temp.

The \nmajority  of RS -232 transceivers with  1.8V GPIO co mpatibi lity requ ire a logic supply pin for the \nI/O translation, in add ition to a mini mum 3.3 V V CC for all of the other act ive circuitry on the chip. \nUnlike these transceivers, UM3 122EEQA  can operate with both V L and VCC equal to 1.8V. When \nVCC=3.0V to 5.5V , the c harge pum p will sense V CC and switch to doubler mode. C1  & C2 a re the \nnecessar y flyin g capacitors, C3 is not needed , and the charge pump outputs V + & V– will regulate  \nto ~+ /-5.4V. When VCC=1.65V to 2.0V, the charge pump will sense VCC and switch to tripler  \nmode. C1 , C2&C3 are all necessary, and the charge pump outputs  V+ & V– will r egulate  to \n~+/-2.65*V CC from VCC=1.65 V to 2.0V.  \nWith many modern applications expanding into p roducts that use UM3122EEQA  as a bac kup \ncommunication protocol, itis importan t for the transc eiver to have efficient standby operation. In \norder to  accommodate  this, Aut o Powerdown Plus has been inte grated to shut -off all active \ncircuitry, allowing UM3122E EQA  to achieve an I off of 1uA.  \nIn or der to comply with common in terface syste m needs  and envi ronments, the RS -232 receive \nand transmit I/O  pins com ply with IEC 61 000-4-2 ratings.  \n \nDetailed Functiona l Block Diagram  \n \n \n1.65V min\nCBYPASS\nC1\nC2C1+\nC1-\nC2+\nC2-\nDOUT1 DIN1\nRIN1 ROUT1VCC\nV+\nV-\n5kΩ+\n+\nDOUT2 DIN2\nRIN2 ROUT25kΩ\nGNDGPIO Inputs\nRS-232 Outputs\nRS-232 InputsC4VL\nC3+ C3+\nC3-\nAuto \nShutdownFORCEON\nFORCEOFFINVALID\nVL\nVLC5\nGPIO OutputsCharge Pump \nOutputs1.65V min\nCharge\nPump\n \n \nFigure 12.

The charge \npump operates in two  modes to efficiently  accommodate  low voltage (1.8 V) and higher vol tage \n(3.3V & 5.0 V) supplie s. \n \nDoubler Mo de：The charge pump requires two flying capacitors (C1, C2) and reservoir capacitors \n(C4, C5) to generate the V + and V - supplies of approximately ± 5.4 V when V CC is greater than 3 V. \nWhen V CC is >2.9V, UM3122EEQA  will sense  the supply voltage level and switc h the charge \npump to a doubler. Hence, no need for a third flying capacitor.  C3+&C3 - pins can be left open for \nproper operation. If a capacitor is placed between C3+&C3 -, the charge  pump will ignore this \ncapacitor and still behave as a doubl er. For capacit or choice recommendations, please refer to \nCapacitor Selection Table . \n \nTripler Mode ：The charge pump requires three flying capacitors (C1, C2&C3) and reservoir \ncapacitors (C4, C5) to generate  the V + and V - supplies of approximately ± 2.65 *VCC when V CC is \ngreater than 1.65 V. When V CC is < 2.1V,  UM3122EEQA  will sense the supply voltage lev el and \nswitch the charge pump to a tri pler.  \n \n \nDrivers  \nThe drivers are inverting level transmitters that convert TTL or CMOS logic levels to RS -232 \nlevels. For V CC =3.0V to 5.0V, the RS -232 output voltage swing is typically ± 5.4 V fully loaded \nand ± 5 V mini mum fully loaded. For  VCC = 1.8 V, the RS -232 output voltage swing is typically \n± .4.7 V fully loaded and ± 4.25 V minimum fully loaded.  The driver outputs are protected against \nindefinite short -circuits to ground without degradation in reliability. These  drivers  are compatible \nwith RS -232 logic levels and all previous RS -232 versions. Unused driver inputs should be  \nconnected to GND or V CC. \n \nReceivers  \nThe receivers convert EIA/TIA -232 levels to TTL or CMOS logic output levels. Receivers have \nan inverting outp ut that can be disabled by using the FORCEOFF___________________\n pin. Receivers remain active \nwhen the Auto Powerdown Plus  circuitry autonomously enters a low power state. See Auto \nPowerdown Plus for more information on the Auto  Powerdown mode. If the FORCEOFF___________________\n pin is \nmanually set low, the receivers will be disabled and put into 3 -state mode. In either of these \nPower down mode s, the device will typically consume about 0.5 uA. The truth table  logic  of the \nUM3122EEQA  driver and receiver outputs can be found in Device Functional Modes. Since \nreceiver input is  usually from a transmission line where long cable lengths and s ystem \ninterference can degrade the signal, the  inputs have a typical hysteresis margin of 300 mV. This \nensures that the receiver is virtually immune to noisy  transmission lines. Should an input be left \nunconnected, an internal 5kΩ pull -down resistor to gro und will commit  the output of the receiver \nto a HIGH state.  \n \nAuto Powerdown Plus  \nPowerdown is engaged in two separate cases: automatically, when no activity has  occurred  for a \nperiod of time,  and manually, using the FORCEOFF——————————\n device pin.  \n \nAutomatic Powerdown ：Auto Powerdown Plus is enabled when FORCEON is set LOW and \n                                                                                          \n________________________________________________________________________  \nhttp://www .union -ic.com  Rev.02 Nov.2021                                     14/19 \nUM3122 EEQA\nA FORCEOFF———————————\n is set HIGH. Using UM3122EEQA 's integrated edge detection  circuitry and timer, \nthe device can sense when there is no activity on the driver or  receiver inputs for 30 seconds. \nWhen this condition is sensed by the device, it automatically shuts the charge  pump off, reducing \nsupply current to 0.5 μA. When a valid tr ansition is sensed on one of the driver or receiver  inputs, \nthe charge pump turns back on and UM3122EEQA  exits powerdown. The typical time to exit \npowerdown is  typically in 30 us, but can be as long as 150 us. As a result, the system saves power \nwithout re quiring any  software control. Device Functional Modes summarizes the operating \nmodes in truth table form.  While in the low power mode with Automatic Powerdown enabled \n(FORCEOFF——————————\n = HIGH and FORCEON = LOW),  the receiver inputs are still e nabled.  \n \nManual Powerdown ： \nThe device can be manually powered down by externally setting FORCEOFF——————————\n pin to low logic \nlevel. Both the drivers and receivers will be powered off. Device Functional Modes summarizes \nthe operating modes in truth  table form.  \n \nForced On ：If the FORCEOFF——————————\n and FORCEON pins are both set H IGH, the device will power \non with Auto Powerdown Plus  disabled. Both the drivers and receiver will be active regardless of \ninactivity. Because Powerdown is  autonomous, FORCEON can be used ensure drivers are ready \nfor new data transmission if the time sinc e last  transmission (or receive data) was more than 15  \nseconds.

The rise time for RS -232 driver edges is \nslow enough that  the data cable appears as a capacitor instead of a transmission line impedance. \nThe elapsed time for one bit of  data far exceeds  the transit time of any practical RS -232 cable \nlength. The capacit ance of the cable is the limiting  factor.  Therefore ， the capacitance per foot (or \nmeter) of the cable is important if long data cables are used.  Capacitance slows the rise and fall \ntime of t he signal. For low data rates, the delay is insignificant. However , high  data rates will have \nreduced percentage of time that the output is at V OL or V OH and more time in the transitions.  \nThe timing of the UART (universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter)  must sample the signal at \nthe right time to  coincide with V OL and VOH plateaus. At some point data reliability will be \nimpacted. There are no hard limits for  cable capacitance and data rate.  \n \n \nFigure 14. Typical Waveform with Capacitive Load  \nVCC = 3.3 V, R LOAD = 3 kΩ, Date Rate = 500kbps ，C=2nF \nThe maximum cable length depend s on the cable used (pf/ft), data rate, timing of receiving UART, \nsystem  tolerance to data errors.  \n \nCapacitor S election       \nThe capacitor type used for C1 –C5 is not critical for proper operation; polarized o r non-polarized \ncapacitors can be used, th ough l ower ESR capacitors are preferred. The charge pump requires 0.1 \nμF capacitors for V CC =1.8V or V CC = 3.3V operation. For other supply voltages, see the Capacitor \nSelection Table  for required capacitor values. Do not use  values smaller than those list ed in  \nCapacitor Selection Table . Increasing the capacitor values , except for C1,  reduces ri pple on the \ntransmitter outputs and slightly reduces power consumption. C2, C3, C4 and C5 can be  increased \nwithout changing C1’s  value. However, do no t increase C1 w ithout  also increasing the values of \nC2, C3, C4, C5, C BYPASS1 , and C BYPASS2  to ma intain the  proper ratios (C1 to the other capacitors). \nWhen using the  minimum required capacitor values, make sure the capacitor value doe s not \ndegrade excessiv ely with temper ature.  If in doubt, use capacitors with a larger nominal value. The \ncapacitor’s e quivalent series resistance  (ESR) usually increases at low temperatures.  \nFor best charge pump efficiency locate the charge pump and bypass  capacitors as close a s possible \nto the IC.  Surface mount capacitors are best for this purpose. Using capacitors with lower \nequivalent series resistance  (ESR) and self -inductance, along with minimizing parasitic PCB trace \ninductance will optimize charge pu mp operation. Designer s are also advi sed to  consider that \ncapacitor values may shift over time and operating  temperatu re. \n \n \n \n                                                                                          \n________________________________________________________________________  \nhttp://www .union -ic.com  Rev.02 Nov.2021                                     17/19 \nUM3122 EEQA\nA  \nCapacitor Selection Table  \n \nVCC = VL C1 Capacitor  \nValue  C2 Capacitor  \nValue  C3 Capacitor  \nValue  C4 Capacitor  \nValue  C5 Capacitor  \nValue \n1.65 V to 2 V \n（Note1） 100 nF \n3.0 V to 3.6 V  \n（Note1） 100 nF 100 nF or open  100nF  \n4.5 V to 5.5 V  \n（Note1） 47 nF 330 nF 100 nF or open  330nF \n3 V to 5.5 V  \n（Note2） 47 nF 470 nF 100 nF or open  470nF \nNote1：For optimized performance, we recommend using these configuration s. \nNote2：For ap plicat ions w here the V CC variation is larger, this configuration is acceptable.  \n \n \nApplication Curves  \n \n \n \nFigure 14. 1 Mbps Eye Diagram, 2 V/div, 200 ns/ div  \nVCC = 1.8 V, C LOAD = 500 pF, R LOAD = 3 k Ω \n \n \nPower Supply Recommendations  \nIn most circumstances, a 0.1 μF V CC bypa ss capacitor and a 1 μF VL bypass capacitor are adequate. \nIn applications that are sensitive  to powe r-supply  noise, use larger value V CC bypass capacitor. \nThere is no  maximum limit for bypass capacitor.
