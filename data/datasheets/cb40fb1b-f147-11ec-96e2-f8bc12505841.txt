Pin Descriptions  \nSerial Clock (CLK) : The SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and \noutput operations.  \n \nSerial Data Input, Output and I /Os (DI, DO and DQ 0, DQ 1, DQ 2, DQ 3): The FM25W32  supports \nstandard SPI, Dual SPI, Quad SPI and QPI operation. Standard SPI instructions use the \nunidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the \nrising edge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard S PI also uses the unidirectional DO \n(output) to read data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \n \nDual/Quad SPI and QPI instructions use the bidirectional DQ pins to serially write instructions, \naddresses or data to the device on the rising e dge of CLK and read data or status from the \ndevice on the falling edge of CLK. Quad SPI and QPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad \nEnable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set.  When QE=1, the WP#  pin becomes DQ 2 and \nHOLD#  pin becomes DQ 3. \n \nChip S elect (CS#) : The SPI Chip Select (CS#) pin enables and disables device operation. \nWhen CS# is high, the device is deselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or DQ 0, DQ 1, DQ 2, \nDQ 3) pins are at high impedance. When deselected, the devices power consumption will be at \nstandby levels unless an internal erase, program or write status register cycle is in progress. \nWhen CS# is brought low, the device will be selected, power consumption will increase to active \nlevels and instructions can be written to and data re ad from the device. After power -up, CS# \nmust transition from high to low before a new instruction will be accepted. The CS# input must \ntrack the VCC supply level at power -up (see “9Write Protection ” and Figure 62). If needed a pull -\nup resister on CS# can be used to accomplish this.  \n \nHOLD (HOLD#) : The HOLD# pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. \nWhen HOLD# is brought low, whi le CS# is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals \non the DI and CLK pins will be ignored (don’t care). When HOLD# is brought high, device \noperation can resume. The HOLD# function can be useful when multiple devices are sharing the \nsame SPI si gnals. The HOLD# pin is active low. When the QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for \nQuad I/O, the HOLD# pin function is not available since this pin is used for DQ 3.  \n \nWrite Protect ( WP# ): The Write Protect ( WP# ) pin can be used to prevent the Status Registers \nfrom being written. Used in conjunction with the Status Register’s Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, \nBP2, BP1 and BP0) bits and Status Register Protect (SRP) bits, a portion as small as a 4KB \nsector or the entir e memory array can be hardware protected. The WP#  pin is active low. \nHowever, when the QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, the WP#  pin function is not \navailable since this pin is used for DQ 2. \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               6 \n7. Memory Organization  \nThe FM25W32  array is organized into 16,384  programmable pages of  256-bytes  each.  Up to \n256 bytes can be programmed (bits are programmed from 1 to 0)  at a time.  Pages  can be \nerased  in groups  of 16 (4KB  sector  erase),  groups  of 128 (32KB block erase), groups  of 256 \n(64KB block erase)  or the entire  chip (chip  erase).The  FM25W32  has 1,024  erasable sectors , \n128 erasable 32 -k byte blocks  and 64 erasable 64-k byte blocks respe ctively. The small 4KB \nsectors  allow  for greater flexibility in applications that require  data and parameter storage.  \n \nTable 1 Memory Organization  \nBlock  \n(64KB)  Block  \n(32KB)  Sector  \n(4KB)  Address  Range  \n63 127 \n| \n126 1023  3FF000h  3FFFFFh  \n… … … \n1008  3F0000h  3F0FFFh  \n62 125 \n| \n124 1007  3EF000h  3EFFFFh  \n… … … \n992 3E0000h  3E0FFFh  \n61 123 \n| \n122 991 3DF000h  3DFFFFh  \n… … … \n976 3D0000h  3D0FFFh  \n. \n. \n. \n2 5 \n| \n4 47 02F000h  02FFFFh  \n… … … \n32 020000h  020FFFh  \n1 3 \n| \n2 31 01F000h  01FFFFh  \n… … … \n16 010000h  010FFFh  \n0 1 \n| \n0 15 00F000h  00FFFFh  \n… … … \n2 002000h  002FFFh  \n1 001000h  001FFFh  \n0 000000h  000FFFh  \n \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               7 \n8.

Standard SPI  \nThe FM25W32  is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial \nClock (CLK), Chip Select ( CS#), Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard \nSPI instructions use the DI input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device \non the rising edge of CLK. The DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on \nthe falling edge of CLK.  \n \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are support ed. The primary difference between \nMode 0 and Mode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in \nstandby and data is not being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0, the CLK signal is \nnormally low on the falling and risi ng edges of CS#. For Mode 3, the CLK signal is normally high \non the falling and rising edges of CS#. \nCS#\nCLK\nDI\nDOMODE3\nMODE0MODE3\nMODE0\nBit7Bit6Bit5Bit4Bit3Bit2Bit1Bit0\nBit7Bit6Bit5Bit4Bit3Bit2Bit1Bit0\nMSBMSBHIGH IMPEDANCEDONT CARE\n \nFigure 3 The difference between Mode 0 and Mode 3  \n \n8.2. Dual SPI  \nThe FM25W32  supports Dual SPI operation when using instructions such as “Fast Read Dual \nOutput (3Bh)” and “Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh)”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to \nor from the device at two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices . The Dual SPI \nRead instructions are ideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -\nshadowing) or for executing non -speed - critical code directly from the SPI bus (XIP). When using \nDual SPI instructions, the DI and DO pins become bidirection al I/O pins: DQ 0 and DQ 1. \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               8 \n8.3. Quad SPI  \nThe FM25W32  supports Quad SPI operation when using instructions such as “Fast Read Quad \nOutput (6Bh)”, “Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh)”, “Word Read Quad I/O (E7h)” and “Octal Word Read \nQuad I/O (E3h)”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the device four to six \ntimes the rate of ordinary Serial Flash. The Quad Read instructions offer a significant improvement in \ncontinuous and random access transfer rates allowing fast code -shadowing to RAM or execution \ndirectly from the SPI bus (XIP). When using Quad SPI instructions the DI and DO pins become \nbidirectional DQ 0 and DQ 1 and the WP #  and HOLD#  pins become DQ 2 and DQ 3 respectively. Quad \nSPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set.  \n8.4. QPI \nThe FM25W32  supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) operations only when the device is \nswitched from Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using the “Enable QPI (38h)” instruction. \nThe typical SPI protocol requires that the byte -long instruction code being shifted  into the device only \nvia DI pin in eight serial clocks. The QPI mode utilizes all four DQ pins to input the instruction code, \nthus only two serial clocks are required. This can significantly reduce the SPI instruction overhead \nand improve system performan ce in an XIP environment. Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode and QPI \nmode are exclusive. Only one mode can be active at any given time. “Enable QPI (38h)” and \n“Disable QPI (FFh)” instructions are used to switch between these two modes. Upon power -up or \nafter a so ftware reset using “Reset (99h)” instruction, the default state of the device is \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI mode. To enable QPI mode, the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in \nStatus Register -2 is required to be set. When using QPI instructions, the DI and DO p ins become \nbidirectional DQ 0 and DQ 1, and the WP#  and HOLD#  pins become DQ 2 and DQ 3 respectively. See \nFigure 2 for the device operation modes.  \n8.5. Hold  \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI operations, the HOLD#  signal allows the FM25W32  operation to \nbe paused while it is actively selected (when CS# is low). The HOLD#  function may be useful in \ncases where the SPI data and clock signals are shared with other devic es. For example, \nconsider if the page buffer was only partially written when a priority interrupt requires use of the \nSPI bus. In this case the HOLD#  function can save the state of the instruction and the data in the \nbuffer so programming can resume where it left off once the bus is available again. The HOLD#  \nfunction is only available for standard SPI and Dual SPI operation, not during Quad SPI or QPI.  \n \nTo initiate a HOLD#  condition, the device must be selected with CS# low. A HOLD#  condition \nwill activate  on the falling edge of the HOLD#  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is \nnot already low the  HOLD#  condition will activate after the next falling edge of CLK. The HOLD#  \ncondition will terminate on the rising edge of the HOLD#  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If \nthe CLK is not already low the HOLD#  condition will terminate after the next falling edge of CLK. \nDuring a HOLD#  condition, the Serial Data Output (DO) is high impedance, and Serial Data \nInput (DI) and Serial Clock (CLK) are i gnored. The Chip Select ( CS#) signal should be kept \nactive (low) for the full duration of the HOLD#  operation to avoid resetting the internal logic state \nof the device.  \nActive Active Active Hold Hold\n \nFigure 4 Hold  Condition Waveform  \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               9 \n9. Write Protection  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise \nand other adverse system conditions that may compromise data integrity. To address this \nconcern, the FM25W32  provides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n \nWrite Protect Features  \n\uf06c Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n\uf06c Time delay write disable after Power -up \n\uf06c Write enable/disable instructions and automatic write disable after erase or prog ram \n\uf06c Software and Hardware ( WP#  pin) write protection using Status Register  \n\uf06c Write Protection using Power -down instruction  \n\uf06c Lock Down write protection for Status Register until the next power -up \n\uf06c One Time Program (OTP) write protection for array and Security Sectors  using Status \nRegister.  \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down, the FM25W32  will maintain a reset condition while VCC is \nbelow the threshold value of VWI, (See “12.3Power -up Timing ” and Figure 62). While reset, all \noperations are disabled and no instructions are reco gnized. During power -up and after the VCC \nvoltage exceeds VWI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled for a time \ndelay of t PUW. This includes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip \nErase and the Write Statu s Register instructions. Note that the chip select pin ( CS#) must track \nthe VCC supply level at power -up until the VCC -min level and t VSL time delay is reached. If \nneeded a pull -up resister on CS# can be used to accomplish this.  \n \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Status \nRegister Write Enable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Write Enable instruction must be issued before \na Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction will  \nbe accepted. After completing a program, erase or write instruction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) \nis au tomatically cleared to a write -disabled state of 0.  \n \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instruction and \nsetting the Status Register Protect (SRP0, SRP1) and Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 \nand BP0) bits. These settings allow a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire memory \narray to be configured as read only. Used in conjunction with the Write P rotect ( WP# ) pin, \nchanges to the Status Register can be enabled or disabled under hardware control. See Status \nRegister section for further information. Additionally, the Power -down instruction offers an extra \nlevel of write protection as all instructions are ignored except for the Release Power -down \ninstruction.  \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               10 \n10. Status Register  \nThe Read Status Register instructions can be used to provide status on the availability of the \nFlash memory array, if the device is write enabled or disabled, the state of write protection, Quad \nSPI setting, Security Sector  lock status. The Write Status Re gister instruction can be used to \nconfigure the device write protection features, Quad SPI setting and Security Sector  OTP lock. \nWrite access to the Status Register is cont rolled by the state of the non -volatile Status Register \nProtect bits (SRP0, SRP1), t he Write Enable instruction, and during Standard/Dual SPI \noperations, the WP# pin.  \n \nFactory default for all Status Register bits are 0.  \nS6 S5 S7 S3 S2 S4 S1 S0\nSEC TB SRP0 BP1BP0 BP2 WELWIP\nSTATUS REGISTER PROTECT 0\n(non-volatile)\nSECTOR PROTECT\n(non-volatile)\nTOP/BOTTOM PROTECT\n(non-volatile)\nBLOCK PROTECT BITS\n(non-volatile)\nWRITE ENABLE LATCH\nERASE/WRITE IN PROGRESS\n \nFigure 5 Status Register 1 \n \nRFUS14 S13 S15 S11 S10 S12 S9 S8\nCMP LB QESRP1\nCOMPLEMENT PROTECT\n(non-volatile)\nQUAD ENABLE\n(non-volatile)\nSTATUS REGISTER PROTECT 1\n(non-volatile)SECURITY REGISTER LOCK BIT\n(non-Volatile)Error Status\n(volatile, Read only) ERR\nOutput Driver Strength\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)ReservedDRV\n1DRV\n0\n \nFigure 6 Status Register  2 \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               11 \n10.1.  WIP Bit \nWIP is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is \nexecuting a Page Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write \nStatus Register or  Erase/Program Security Sector instruction. During this time the device will \nignore further instructions except for the Read Status Regi ster instruction (see t W, tPP, tSE, tBE, \nand t CE in “12.6AC Electrical Characteristics ”). When the program,  erase or write status  register  \n(or security  sector) instruction has completed, the WIP bit will be cleared to a 0 state indicating \nthe device is ready for further instructions.  \n \n10.2.  Write Enable Latch (WEL)  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the status register (S1) that is set to 1  after \nexecuting a Write Enable Instruction. The WEL status bit is cleared to 0 when the device is write \ndisabled. A write disable  state  occurs  upon  power -up or after any of the following instructions: \nWrite Disable, Page Program, Quad Page Program, Sector  Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, \nWrite Status Register, Erase Security Sector  and Program Security Sector . \n \n10.3.  Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0)  \nThe Block Protect Bits ( BP2-0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register (S4 -2) that \nprovide Write Protection control and status. Block Protect bits can be set using the Write Status \nRegister Instruction (see t W in “12.6  AC Electrical Characteristics ”). All, none or a portion of the \nmemory array can be protected from Program and Erase instructions (see Table 4 Status \nRegister Memory  Protection ). The factory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of \nthe array protected.  \n \n10.4.  Top/Bottom Block Protect (TB)  \nThe non -volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block Protec t Bits (BP2 -0) protect from the \nTop (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in Table 4 Status Register Memory  \nProtection  table. The factory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the Write Status \nRegister Instruction depending on the state of the SRP0, SRP1 and WEL bits.  \n \n10.5.  Sector/Block Protect (SEC)  \nThe non -volatile Sector/Block Protect bit (SEC) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2 -0) protect \neither 4KB Sectors (SEC=1) or 64KB Blocks (SEC=0) in the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of \nthe array as shown in Table 4 Status Register Memory  Protection  table. The default setting is \nSEC=0.  \n \n10.6.  Complement Protect (CMP)  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S1 2). It \nis used in conjunction with S EC, TB, BP 2-0 bits to provide more flexibility for the array protection. \nOnce CMP is set to 1, previous a rray protection set by SEC, TB and BP2 -0 will be reversed. For \ninstance, when CMP=0, a top 4KB sector can be protected while the rest of the array is not; \nwhen CMP=1, the top 4KB sector will become unprotected while the rest of the array become \nread-only. Please refer to Table 4 Status Register Memory  Protection  table  for details. The \ndefault setting is CMP=0.  \n \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               12 \n10.7.  Status Register Protect (SRP1, SRP0)  \nThe Status Regist er Protect bits (SRP1 and SRP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status \nregister (S8  and S7). The SRP bits control  the method  of write  protection:  software  protection,  \nhardware protection, power supply lock -down or one time programmable (OTP) protection.  \n \nTable 2 Status Register Protect bits  \nSRP1  SRP0  WP#  Status  \nRegister  Description  \n0 0 X Software  \nProtection  WP#  pin has no control. The Status register can be \nwritten to after a Write Enable instruction, WEL=1. \n(Factory Default ) \n0 1 0 Hardware  \nProtected  When WP#  pin is low the Status Register locked and can \nnot be written to.  \n0 1 1 Hardware  \nUnprotected  When WP#  pin is high the Status register is unlocked and \ncan be written to after a Write Enable instruction, WEL=1.  \n1 0 X Power Supply  \nLock -Down  Status Register is protected and can not be written to \nagain until the next power -down, power -up cycle.(1) \n1 1 X One Time  \nProgram  Status Register is permanently protected and can not be \nwritten to.  \nNote:  \n1. When SRP1, SRP0 = (1, 0), a power -down, power -up cycle will change SRP1, SRP0 to (0, 0) \nstate.  \n \n10.8.  Output driver strength (DRV1, DRV0)  \nThe DRV1 & DRV0 bits are used to determine the output driver strength.  \nTable 3 Driver Strength  bits \nDRV1, DRV0  Driver Strength  \n0,0 100%  \n0,1 75% \n1,0 50% \n1,1 25% \n \n10.9.  Error  Bit (ERR ) \nThe Error  bit is a status flag, which shows the status of last Program /Erase  operation. It will be \nset to "1", if the Program /Erase  operation fails . If the Program /Erase  region is protected , Error bit \nwill not be set to “1”. It will be clear  to “0” after power -up, or software Reset /Write Enable  \ninstruction . \n \n10.10.  Security Sector  Lock Bit ( LB) \nThe Security Register Lock Bit (LB) is non-volatile One Time Program (OTP) bit  in Status \nRegister (S 10) that provide s the write protect control and status to the Security Register s. The \ndefault state of LB is 0, Security Register s are unlocked. LB can be set to 1  using the Write \nStatus Register instruction. LB bit is One Time Programmable (OTP), once it’s set to 1, the \nSecurity Register s will become read -only permanently.  \n \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               13 \n10.11.  Quad Enable (QE)  \nThe Quad Enable (QE) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S9) that allows \nQuad SPI and QPI operation. When the QE bit is set to a 0 state (factory default), the WP#  pin \nand HOLD#  are enabled. When the QE bit is set to a 1, the Quad DQ 2 and DQ 3 pins are enabled, \nand WP#  and HOLD#  functions are disabled.  \n \nQE bit is required to be set to a 1 before issuing an “Enable QPI (38h)” to switch the device from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI to QPI; otherwise the command will be ignored. When the device is in \nQPI mode, QE bit will remain to be 1. A “Write Status Register” command in QPI mode cannot \nchange QE bit from a “1” to a “0”.  \n \nWARNING: If the WP#  or HOLD#  pins are tied directly to the power su pply or ground \nduring standard SPI or Dual SPI operation, the QE bit should never be set to a 1.  \n \n10.12.

Instructions  \nThe Standard/Dual/Quad SPI instruction set of the FM25W32  consists of 34 basic instructions \nthat are fully controlled through the SPI bus (see Table 6 ~ Table 8 ). Instr uctions are initiated with \nthe falling edge of Chip Select ( CS#). The first byte of data clocked into the DI input provides the \ninstruction code. Data on the DI input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with most significant \nbit (MSB) first.  \n \nThe QPI in struction set of the FM25W32  consists of 23 basic instructions that are fully controlled \nthrough the SPI bus (see  Table 9 QPI Instructions Set ). Instructions are initiated with the falling \nedge of Chip Select ( CS#). The firs t byte of data clocked through DQ [3:0] pins provides the \ninstruction code. Data on all four DQ pins are sampled on the rising edge of clock with most \nsignificant bit (MSB) first. All QPI instructions, addresses, data and dummy bytes are using all \nfour DQ pins to transfer every byte of data with every two serial clocks (CLK).  \n \nInstructions vary in l ength from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address \nbytes, data bytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a combination. Instructions are \ncompleted with the rising edge of edge CS#. Clock relative timing diagrams for each ins truction \nare included in Figure 7 through Figure 66. All read instructions can be completed after any \nclocked bit. However, all instructions that Write, Program or Erase must complete on a byte \nboundary ( CS# driven high after a full 8 -bits have been clocked) otherwise the instruction will be \nignored.  This feature further protects the device from inadvertent writes. Additionally, while the \nmemory is being programmed or erased, or when the Status Register is being written, all \ninstructions except for Read Status Register will be ignored until the progra m or erase cycle has \ncompleted.  \n \n11.1.

The Write Enable (WREN ) instruction is entered by driving CS# low, \nshifting the instruction code “06h” into the Data Input (DI) pin on the rising edge of CLK, and then \ndriving CS# high.  \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (06h)CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)\nD0\n(DQ1)High ImpedanceMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\n(06h)CS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ3\n \nFigure 7 Write Enable Instruction for SPI Mode (left) or QPI Mode (right)  \n \n11.7.  Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h)  \nThe non -volatile Status Register bits described in section 10.1 can also be written to as volatile \nbits. This gives more flexibility to change the system configuration and memory protection \nschemes quickly without waiting for the typical non -volatile bit write cycles or affecting the \nendura nce of the Status Register non -volatile bits. To write the volatile values into the Status \nRegister bits, the Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction must be issued prior \nto a Write Status Register (01h /31h) instruction. Write Enable for Volatile Status Register \ninstruction ( Figure 8) will not set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit, it is only valid for the Write \nStatus Register instruction to change the volatile Status Regi ster bit values.  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction(\n50h)CS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ30       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (50h)CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)\nD0\n(DQ1)High Impedance\n \nFigure 8 Write Enable for Volatile Status Register Instruction for SPI Mode (left) or QPI \nMode (right)  \n \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               21 \n11.8.

Read Status Register -1(RDSR 1) (05h) , Status Register -2 \n(RDSR 2)(35h)  \nThe Read Status Register instructions allow the 8 -bit Status Registers to be read. The instruction \nis entered by driving CS# low and shifting the instruction code “05h”for Status Register -1 or “35h” \nfor Status Register -2 into the DI pin on the  rising edge of CLK. The status register bits are then \nshifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown \nin Figure 10 and Figure 11. The Status Register bits are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. \n \nThe Read Status Register instruction may be used at any time, even while a Program, Erase or \nWrite Status Register cycle is in progress. This allows the WIP status bit to be checked to \ndetermine when the cycle is complete and if the device can accept another instruction. The \nStatus Register can be read continuously, as shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11 The instruction is \ncompleted by driving CS# high.  \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (05h/35h)CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)8       9      10     11     12     13     14     15 16     17     18     19     20     21     22     23 \n«=MSB « «Status Register 1/2 out\nD0\n(DQ1)High Impedance\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 7Status Register 1/2 out\n \nFigure 10 Read Status Register Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               22 \nMode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction\n05h/35hCS#\nCLK0       1 2       3 4       5\nDQ04       0 4       0 4       \nDQ1 5       1 5       1 5       \nDQ2 6       2 6       2 6       \nDQ37       3 7       3 7       \nSR1/2 outSR1/2 out \nFigure 11 Read Status Register Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n11.10.  Write Status Register -1(WRSR) (01h) , Status Register -2 (31h)  \nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction allows the Status Register to be written. Only non -\nvolatile Status Register bits SRP0, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1, BP0 (bits 7 thru 2 of Status Register -1) , \nCMP, DRV0, DRV1, LB, QE, SRP1 (bits 14 and bit 12 thru8 of Status Register -2) , can be \nwritten to. All other Status Register bit locations are read -only and will not be affected by the \nWrite Status Register  (WRSR) instruction. LB is non-volatile OTP bit, once it is set to 1, it cannot \nbe cleared to 0. The Status Register bits are shown in  shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 and \ndescribed in 10 Status Register  \n \nTo write non -volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must \npreviously have been executed for the device to accept the Write Status Register (WRSR)  \ninstruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). Once write enabled, the instruction is entered \nby driving CS# low, sending the instruction code “01h”, and then writing the status register data \nbyte as illustrated in Figure 12 and Figure 13.  \n \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction \nmust have been executed prior to  the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction (Status Register \nbit WEL remains 0). However, SRP1 and LB, cannot be changed from “1” to “0” because of the \nOTP protection f or these bits. Upon power off or the execution of a “Reset (99h)” instruction, the \nvolatile Status Register bit values will be lost, and the non -volatile Status Register bit values will \nbe restored.  \n \nTo complete the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction , the CS# pin must be driven high after \nthe eighth or sixteenth bit of data that is clocked in. If this is not done the Write Status Register \n(WRSR) instruction will not be executed. If CS# is driven high after the eighth clock the DRV1,  \nDRV0,  CMP  and QE b its will be cleared to 0.  \n \nDuring non -volatile Status Register write operation (06h combined with 01h), after CS# is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Write Status Register cycle will commence for a time duration of t W (See \n“12.6  AC Electrical Characteristics ”). Whil e the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the \nRead Status Register instruction may still be accessed to check the status of the WIP bit. The \nWIP bit is a 1 during the Write Status Register cycle  and a 0 when the cycle is finished and \nready to accep t other instructions again. After the Write Status  Register cycle has finished, the \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register will be cleared to 0.  \n \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               23 \nDuring volatile Status Register write operation (50h combined with 01h), after CS# is driven high , \nthe Status Register bits will be refreshed to the new values within the time period of t SHSL2  (See \n“12.6  AC Electrical Characteristics ”). WIP bit will remain 0 during the Status Register bit  refresh \nperiod.  \n \nThe Write Status Register  (WRSR)  instruction can be used in both SPI mode and QPI mode. \nHowever, the QE bit cannot be written to 0when the device is in the QPI mode, because QE=1 is \nrequired for the device to enter and operate in the QPI mode.  \n \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (01h/31h)CS#\nCLK8       9      10     11     12     13     14     15 \nStatus Register 1/2 inMode 3\nMode 0\nD0\n(DQ1)\n«=MSBDI\n(DQ0)\n«\nHigh Impedance7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n \nFigure 12 Write Status Register Instruction ( SPI Mode)  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction\n01h/31hCS#\nCLK0       1 2       3\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ37       3SR 1/2\ninMode 3\nMode 0\n6       25       14       0 4       0\n5       1\n6       2\n7       3\n \nFigure 13 Write Status Register Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n11.11.  Read Data (03h)  \nThe Read Data instruction allows one or more data bytes to be sequentially read from the \nmemory. The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and then shifting the instruction \ncode “03h” followed by a  24-bit address A23-A0 into the DI pin. The c ode and address bits are \nlatched on the rising edge of the CLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the \naddressed memory location will be shifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with \nmost significant bit (MSB) first. The addres s is automatically incremented to the next higher \naddress after each byte of data is shifted out allowing for a continuous stream of data. This \nmeans that the entire memory can be accessed with a single instruction as long as the clock \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               24 \ncontinues. The instr uction is completed by driving CS# high.  \n \nThe Read Data instruction sequence is shown in Figure 146. If a Read Data instruction is \nissued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process ( WIP =1) the instruction is ignored \nand will not have any effect  on the current cycle.

This is accomplished \nby adding eight “dummy” clocks after the 24 -bit address as shown in Figure 15.

Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh)  \nThe Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh) instruction is similar to the Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh) instruction \nexcept that address and data bits are input and output through four pins DQ 0, DQ 1, DQ 2 and DQ 3 \nand four Dummy clocks are required in SPI mode prior to the data output. The Quad I/O \ndramatically reduces instruction overhead allowing faster random access for code execution (XIP) \ndirectly from the Quad SPI. The Quad Enable bit (QE) of Status Register -2 must be set to enable \nthe Fast Read Quad I/O Instruction.  \n \nFast Read Quad I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Fast Read  Quad  I/O instruction  can further  reduce  instruction  overhead  through  setting  the \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7-0) after the input Address bits A23-A0, as shown in Figure 21. \nThe upper nibble of the (M7-4) controls the length of the next Fast Read Quad I/O instruction \nthrough the inclusion or exclusion of the first byte instruction code.

The “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) \ncommand  can either enable or disable the “Wrap Around” feature for  the following EBh \ncommands. When “Wrap Around” is enabled, the data being accessed can be limited to either a 8, \n16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a256 -byte page. The output data starts at the initial address specified \nin the instruction, once it reaches the e nding boundary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, the output \nwill wrap around to the beginning boundary automatically until CS# is pulled high to terminate the \ncommand.  \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critica l address \nand then fill the cache afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing \nmultiple read commands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction allows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be set. The W4 bit is used \nto enable or disable th e “Wrap Around” operation while W6 -5 are used to specify the length of the \nwrap around section within a page. See “11.19  Set Burst with Wrap (77h) ” for detail descriptions.  \n \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               31 \nFast Read Quad I/O (EBh) in QPI Mode  \nThe Fast Read Quad I/O instruction is also supported in QPI mode, as shown in Figure 23. When \nQPI mode is enabled, the number of dummy clocks is configured by the “Set Read Parameters \n(C0h)” instruction to accommodate a wide rang e application  with different needs for either \nmaximum Fast Read frequency or minimum data access latency. Depending on the Read \nParameter Bits P[5:4] setting, the number of dummy clocks can be configured as either 2, 4, 6 or \n8. The default number of dummy clocks upon power up or after a Reset instruction is 2. In QPI \nmode, the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M7 -0 are also considered as dummy clocks. In the \ndefault setting, the data output will follow the Continuous Read Mode bits immediately.  \n \n“Continuous Read Mode” feature is also available in QPI mode for Fast Read Quad I/O \ninstruction. Please refer to the description on previous pages.  \n \n“Wrap Around” feature is not available in QPI mode for Fast Read Quad I/O instruction. To \nperform a read operation with fixe d data length wrap around in QPI mode, a dedicated “Burst \nRead with Wrap” (0Ch) instruction must be used.

When “Wrap Around” is enabled, the data being accessed can be limited to either a 8, \n16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a256 -byte page. The output data starts at the initial address specified \nin the instruction, once it reaches the ending boundary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, the output \nwill wrap around to the beginning boundary automatically u ntil CS# is pulled high to terminate the \ncommand.  \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical address \nand then fill the cache afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing \nmultiple read commands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction allows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be set. The W4 bit is used \nto enable or disable the “Wrap Around” operation while W6 -5 bits are used to specify the length of \nthe wrap around section within a page. See “11.19 Set Burst with Wrap (77h) ” for  detail \ndescriptions.  \n \n11.18.  Octal Word Read Quad I/O (E3h)  \nThe Octal Word Read Quad I/O (E3h) instruction is similar to the Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh) \ninstruction except that the lower four Address bits (A0, A1, A2, A3) must  equal 0. As a result, the \ndummy clocks are not required, which further reduces the instruction overhead allowing even \nfaster random access for code execution (XIP). The Quad Enable bit (QE) of Status Register -2 \nmust be set to enable the Octal Word Read Qu ad I/O Instruction.  \n \nOctal Word Read Quad I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Octal Word Read Quad I/O instruction can further reduce instruction overhead through \nsetting the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M7-M0 after the input Address bits A23-A0, as shown i n \nFigure 26. The upper nibble of the (M7-4) controls the length of the next Octal Word Read Quad \nI/O instruction through the inclusion or exclusion of the first byte instruction code. The lower \nnibble bits of the (M3-0) are “don’t care (“x”) ”. However, the DQ pins should be high -impedance \nprior to the falling edge of the first data out clock.  \n \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5 -4 = (1,0), then the next Fast Read Quad I/O instruction \n(after CS# is raised and then lowered) does not require the E3h instruction code, as shown in \nFigure 27. This reduces the instruction sequence by eight clocks and allows the Read address to \nbe immediately entered after CS# is asserted low. If the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5 -4 do \nnot equal to (1,0), the next i nstruction (after CS# is raised and then lowered) requires the first \nbyte instruction code, thus returning to normal operation. It is recommended to input FFh on DQ 0 \nfor the next instruction (8 clocks), to ensure M4= 1 and return the device to normal opera tion. \nCS#\nIOs switch from\nInput to OutputA23-16     A15-8      A7-0       M7-0\nDQ0 20     16      12      8       4       0       4       0 4       0       4       0       4                               \nDQ1 21     17     13      9       5       1       5       1 5       1       5       1       5                               \nDQ3 23    19      15     11      7       3       7       3       7       3       7       3       7                               \nByte1 Byte2DQ2 22     18     14     10      6       2       6       2 6       2       6       2       6                               0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (E3h)CLK8       9      10     11     12     13     14     15 16     17     18     19     20     21  \n1        5                            \nByte3 Byte4 0        4               \n 2        6                          \n3        7                             \n \nFigure 26 Octal Word Read Quad I/O Instruction (Initial instruction or previous M5 -4 ≠ 10, \nSPI Mode only)  \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               34 \n \nCS#\nIOs switch from\nInput to OutputA23-16     A15-8      A7-0       M7-0\nDQ0 20     16      12      8       4       0       4       0 4       0       4       0       4                               \nDQ1 21     17     13      9       5       1       5       1 5       1       5       1       5                               \nDQ3 23    19      15     11      7       3       7       3       7       3       7       3       7                               \nByte1Byte2DQ2 22     18     14     10      6       2       6       2 6       2       6       2       6                               0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0 CLK8       9      10     11     12     13  \n1        5                            \nByte3 Byte4 0        4               \n 2        6                          \n3        7                             \n \nFigure 27 Octal Word Read Quad I/O Instruction (Previous instruction set M5 -4 = 10, SPI \nMode only)  \n \n11.19.  Set Burst with Wrap (77h)  \nIn Standard SPI mode, the Set Burst with Wrap (77h) instruction is used in conjunction with “Fast \nRead Quad I/O” and “Word Read Quad I/O” instructions to access a fixed length of 8/16/32/64 -\nbyte section within a 256 -byte page. Certain applications can benefit from this feature and \nimprove the overall system code execution performance.  \n \nSimilar to a Quad I/O instruction, the Set Burst with Wrap instruction is initi ated by driving the \nCS# pin low and then shifting the instruction code “77h” followed by 24 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap \nBits”, W7 -0. The instruction sequence is shown in Figure 28.

To exit the “Wrap Around” function and retu rn to normal read operation, \nanother Set Burst with Wrap instruction should be issued to set W4 = 1. The default value of W4 \nupon power on is 1. In the case of a system Reset while W4 = 0, it is recommended that the \ncontroller issues a Set Burst with Wrap instruction to reset W4 = 1 prior to any normal Read \ninstructions since FM25W32  does not have a hardware Reset Pin.  \n \nIn QPI mode, the “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instruction should be used to perform the Read \noperation with “Wrap Around” feature.

Page Program (02h)  \nThe Page Program instruction allows from one byte to 256 bytes (a page) of data to be \nprogrammed at previously erased(FFh) memory locations. A Write Enable instruction must be \nexecuted before the device will accept the Page Program Instruction (Status Regi ster bit WEL= 1). \nThe instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low then shifting the instruction code “02h” \nfollowed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. The CS# pin must \nbe held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the device. The Page \nProgram instruction sequence is shown in Figure 29 and Figure 30. \nIf an entire 256 byte page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significant \naddress bits) should be set  to 0. If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks \nexceed s the remaining page length, the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page. In \nsome cases, less than 256 bytes (a partial page) can be programmed without having any effect \non other bytes within the same page. One condition to perform a partial page program is that the \nnumber of clocks can not exceed the remaining page length. If more than 256 bytes are sent to \nthe device the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page and overwrite previously sent \ndata.  \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the \nlast byte has been latched. If this is not done the Page Program instruction will not be executed. \nAfter CS# is driven  high, the self -timed Page Program instruction will commence for time duration \nof t PP (See “12.6AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While the Page Program cycle is in progress, the \nRead Status Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the WIP bit. The \nWIP bit is a 1 during the Page Program cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the \ndevice is ready to accept other instructions again. After the Page  Program cycle has finished the \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Page Program instruction \nwill not be executed if the addressed page is protected by the Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, \nBP2-0) bits.  \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               36 \nCS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)\n«7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n«0       7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n«7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0  \nData Byte 239     40     41     42     43     44     45     46 47     48     49     50     51     52     53     54     55 \n2072\n2073\n2074\n2075\n2076\n2077\n2078\n2079\nMode 3\nMode 0\nData Byte 3 Data Byte 2560       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (02h)CS#\nCLK8       9      10              28     29     30     31 32     33     34     35     36     37     38     39 \n24-Bit Address\nDI\n(DQ0)\n« «23     22     21               3       2       1       0 Data Byte 1\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n«=MSB \nFigure 29 Page Program Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \n20      16      12       8        4        0        4        0 4        0        4        0                                 \n21      17      13       9        5        1        5        1 5        1        5        1                                    \n23      19      15      11       7        3        7        3 7        3        7        3      22      18      14      10       6        2        6        2 6        2        6        2        A23-16      A15-8       A7-0        Byte1       Byte2        Byte30       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 08       9      10     11     12     13    \nDQ0CS#\nCLK\nDQ2DQ1\nDQ34        0        4        0                                 \n5        1        5        1                                    \n7        3        7        3      6        2        6        2        Instruction\n02h\n   Mode 3\nMode 0516\n517\n518\n519\nByte 255    Byte 256\n \nFigure 30 Page Program Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n11.21.  Quad Input Page Program (32h)  \nThe Quad Page Program instruction allows up to 256 bytes of data to be programmed at \npreviously erased (FFh) memory locations using four pins: DQ 0, DQ 1, DQ 2, and DQ 3.The Quad \nPage Program can improve performance for PROM Programmer and applications that have slow \nclock speeds <5MHz. Systems with faster clock speed will not realize much benefit for the Quad \nPage Program instruction since the inherent page program time is much greater than the time it \ntake to clock -in the data.  \nTo use Quad Page Program the Quad Enable in Status Register -2 must be set (QE=1). A Write \nEnable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Quad Page Program \ninstruction (Status Register -1, WEL=1). The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low then \nshifting the instruction code “32h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 and at least one data byte, \ninto the DQ pins.

Sector Erase (20h)  \nThe Sector Erase instruction sets all memory within a specified sector (4K -bytes) to the erased \nstate of all1s (FFh). A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the \nSector Erase Instruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal  1). The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the CS# pin low and shifting the instruction code “20h” followed a 24 -bit sector address \nA23-A0 (see Figure 1).

Power -down (B9h)  \nAlthough the standby current during normal operation is relatively low, standby current can be \nfurther reduced with the Power -down instruction. The  lower power consumption makes the \nPower -down instruction especially useful for battery powered applications (See I CC1 and I CC2 \nin“12.4DC Electrical Characteristics ”). The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and \nshifting the instruction code “B9h” as shown in Figure 39&Figure 40. \n \nThe CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the \nPower -down instruction will not be executed. After CS# is driven high, the power -down state wi ll \nenter within the time duration of t DP (See “12.6AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While in the power -\ndown state only the Release from Power - down / Device ID instruction, which restores the device \nto normal operation, will be recognized. All other instructions are ignor ed. This includes the Read \nStatus Register instruction, which is always available during normal operation. Ignoring all but \none instruction makes the Power Down state a useful condition for securing maximum write \nprotection. The device always powers -up in the normal operation with the standby current of I CC1. \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               42 \ntDP\n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (B9h)\n      CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)\nPower-down current Stand-by current \nFigure 39 Deep Power -down Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\nB9hCS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ3tDP\nPower-down current Stand-by current\n \nFigure 40 Deep Power -down Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n11.27.  Release Power -down / Device ID (ABh)  \nThe Release from Power -down / Device ID instruction is a multi -purpose instruction. It can be \nused to release the device from the power -down state, or obtain the devices electronic \nidentification (ID) number.  \n \nTo release the device from the power -down state, the instruction is issued by driving the CS# pin \nlow, shifting the instruction code “ABh” and driving CS# high as shown in Figure 41&Figure 42. \nRelease from power -down will take the time duration of t RES1 (See “12.6AC Electrical \nCharacteristics ”) before the device will resume normal operation and other instructions are \naccepted. The CS# pin must remain high during the t RES1 time duration.  \n \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID whil e not in the power -down state, the instruction is \ninitiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3 -dummy \nbytes. The Device ID bits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit \n(MSB) fir st as shown in Figure 41&Figure 42. The Device ID value for the FM25W32  is listed in \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               43 \nTable 5 Manufacturer and Device  Identification  table. The Device ID can be read continuously. \nThe in struction is completed by driving CS# high.  \n \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obtain the Device ID, the \ninstruction is the same as previously described, and shown in Figure 43&Figure 44, except that \nafter CS# is driven high it must remain high for a time duration of t RES2 (See “12.6AC Electrical \nCharacteristics ”). After this time duration the device will resume normal  operation and other \ninstructions will be accepted. If the Release from Power -down / Device ID instruction is issued \nwhile an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (when WIP equals1) the instruction is \nignored and will not have any effect  on the curr ent cycle.  \ntRES1\n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (ABh)\n      CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)         \nPower-down currentStand-by current\n \nFigure 41 Release Power -down Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\nABhCS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ3tRES1\nStand-by current Power-down current\n \nFigure 42 Release Power -down Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               44 \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (ABh)CS#\nCLK8       9              29     30     31 32     33     34     35     36     37     38        \n3 Dummy Bytes\nD0\n(DQ1)DI\n(DQ0)\n«tRES2 Mode 3\nMode 0\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 High Impedance«23     22              2       1       0 \nDevice ID      \n«=MSB Power-down currentStand-by current \nFigure 43 Release Power -down / Device ID Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \nX       X      X       X       X      X       4       0\nX      X       X       X      X       X       5       1   \nX       X       X      X      X       X       7       3     X       X       X      X      X       X       6       2    3 Dummy Bytes  \nDQ0CS#\nCLK\nDQ2DQ1\nDQ3Instruction\nABh0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7         8\n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\n    \nIOs switch from\nInput to Output\nDevice ID\nPower-down currentStand-by currenttRES2\n \nFigure 44 Release Power -down / Device ID Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n11.28.

The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “90h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 of 000000h. After which, the \nManufacturer ID for Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group Co., Ltd  (A1h) and the Device ID \nare shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure \n45&Figure 46. The Device ID value  for the FM25W32  is listed in Table 5 Manufacturer and Device  \nIdentification  table.

The \nSFDP parameters are stored in one or more Parameter Identification (PI D) tables. Currently only \none PID table is specified . The Read SFDP Register instruction is compatible with the SFDP \nstandard initially established in 2010 for PC and other applications, as well as the JEDEC \nstandard 1.0 that is published in 2011.  \n \nThe Re ad SFDP instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction \ncode “5Ah” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0)(1) into the DI pin. Eight “dummy” clocks are \nalso required before the SFDP register contents are shifted out on the fa lling edge of the 40th \nCLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure 52. \n For SFDP register values and descriptions, refer to the following SFDP Definition table.  \n \nNote: 1. A23 -A8 = 0; A7 -A0 are used to define the starting byte address for the 256 -Byte SFDP \nRegister.  \n \nCS#\nCLK\nD0\n(DQ1)DI\n(DQ0) 31     32     33     34     35     36     37     3839     40     41     42     43     44     45     46\n«7        6        5        4        3        2        1        0        7\n«7        6        5        4        3        2        1        0 Data Out 1 Data Out 2CS#\nCLK\nD0\n(DQ1)DI\n(DQ0)Instruction (5Ah)0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 08       9      10              28     29     30     31 \n«=MSBHigh Impedance\n47     48     49     50     51     52     53    54     55\n0        7        6        5        4        3        2        1        0 24-Bit Address\n23     22      21               3       2       1       0\nHigh Impedance«\nDummy Byte\n \nFigure 52 Read SFDP Register  Instruction  \n \nSerial Flash Discoverable Parameter (JEDEC Revision 1.0) Definition Table  \nBYTE \nADDRESS  DATA  DESCRIPTION  COMMENT  \n00h 53h SFDP Signature  \nSFDP Signature  \n= 50444653h  01h 46h SFDP Signature  \n02h 44h SFDP Signature  \n03h 50h SFDP Signature  \n04h 00h SFDP Minor Revision Number  JEDEC Revision 1.0  05h 01h SFDP Major Revision Number  \n06h 00h Number of Parameter Headers (NPH)  1 Parameter Header  \n07h FFh Reserved   \n08h 00h PID(3)(0): ID Number  00h = JEDEC specified  \n09h 00h PID(0): Parameter Table Minor Revision Number  JEDEC Revision 1.0  \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               51 \nBYTE \nADDRESS  DATA  DESCRIPTION  COMMENT  \n0Ah 01h PID(0): Parameter Table Major Revision Number  \n0Bh 09h PID(0): Parameter Table Length  9 Dwords(2) \n0Ch 80h PID(0): Parameter Table Pointer (PTP)  (A7 -A0) PID(0) Pointer =  \n000080h  0Dh 00h PID(0): Parameter Table Pointer (PTP)  (A15 -A8) \n0Eh 00h PID(0): Parameter Table Pointer (PTP)  (A23 -A16)  \n0Fh FFh Reserved   \n10h FFh Reserved   \n...(1) FFh Reserved   \n7Fh FFh Reserved   \n80h E5h Bit[7:5]=111  Reserved  \nBit[4:3]=00  Non-volatile Status Register  \nBit[2]=1  Page Programmable  \nBit[1:0]=01  Supports 4KB Erase   \n81h 20h 4K-Byte Erase Opcode   \n82h F1h Bit[7]  =1 Reserved  \nBit[6]  =1 Supports (1 -1-4) Fast Read  \nBit[5]  =1 Supports (1 -4-4) Fast Read  \nBit[4]  =1 Supports (1 -2-2) Fast Read  \nBit[3]  =0 Not support Dual Transfer \nRate  \nBit[2:1]=00  3-Byte/24 -Bit Only \nAddressing  \nBit[0]  =1 Supports (1 -1-2) Fast Read   \n83h FFh Reserved   \n84h FFh Flash Size in Bits  \n32 Mega Bits =  \n01FFFFFFh  85h FFh Flash Size in Bits  \n86h FFh Flash Size in Bits  \n87h 01h Flash Size in Bits  \n88h 44h Bit[7:5]=010  8 Mode Bits are needed  \nBit[4:0]=00100  16 Dummy Bits are needed  Fast Read Quad I/O \nSetting  89h EBh Quad Input Quad Output Fast Read Opcode  \n8Ah 08h Bit[7:5]=000  No Mode Bits are needed  \nBit[4:0]=01000  8 Dummy Bits are needed  Fast Read Quad \nOutput Setting  8Bh 6Bh Single Input Quad Output Fast Read Opcode  \n8Ch 08h Bit[7:5]=000  No Mode Bits are needed  \nBit[4:0]=01000  8 Dummy Bits are needed  Fast Read Dual Output \nSetting  8Dh 3Bh Single Input Dual Output Fast Read Opcode  \n8Eh 80h Bit[7:5]=100  8 Mode bits are needed  \nBit[4:0]=00000  No Dummy bits are needed  Fast Read Dual I/O \nSetting  8Fh BBh Dual Input Dual Output Fast Read Opcode  \n90h FEh Bit[7:5]=111  Reserved  \nBit[4] =1 support (4 -4-4) Fast Read  \nBit[3:1]=111  Reserved  \nBit[0] =0 Not support (2 -2-2) Fast Read   \n91h FFh Reserved   \n92h FFh Reserved   \n93h FFh Reserved   \n94h FFh Reserved   \n95h FFh Reserved   \n96h 00h No Mode Bits or Dummy Bits for (2 -2-2) Fast \nRead   \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               52 \nBYTE \nADDRESS  DATA  DESCRIPTION  COMMENT  \n97h 00h Not support (2 -2-2) Fast Read  \n98h FFh Reserved   \n99h FFh Reserved   \n9Ah 08h Bit[7:5]=000  No Mode bits are needed  \nBit[4:0]=01000  8 Dummy bits are needed   \n9Bh EBh QPI Fast Read Opcode  \n9Ch 0Ch Sector Type 1 Size (4KB)  \nSector Erase  \nType & Opcode  9Dh 20h Sector Type 1 Opcode  \n9Eh 0Fh Sector Type 2 Size (32KB)  \n9Fh 52h Sector Type 2 Opcode  \nA0h 10h Sector Type 3 Size (64KB)  \nSector Erase  \nType & Opcode  A1h D8h Sector Type 3 Opcode  \nA2h 00h Sector Type 4 Size (256KB) – Not supported  \nA3h 00h Sector Type 4 Opcode – Not supported  \n...(1) FFh Reserved   \nFFh FFh Reserved   \nNotes: \n1.

Erase Security Sector (44h)  \nThe FM25W32  offers one 1024 -byte Security Sector . The Security  Sector  may be used by the \nsystem manufacturers to store security and other important information separately from the main \nmemory array.  \n \nThe Erase  Security Sector  instruction  is similar  to the Sector  Erase  instruction.  A Write  Enable \ninstruction must be executed before the device will accept the Erase Security Sector  Instruction \n(Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and \nshifting the instruction code “44h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 to erase Security Sector s. \n \nA23-16 A15-10 A9-0 \n00h 000000 Don’t Care  \n \nThe Erase Security Sector  instruction sequence is shown in Figure 53. The CS# pin must be \ndriven high after the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the instruction \nwill not be executed. After CS# is driven high, the self -timed Era se Security Sector  operation will \ncommence for a time duration of t SE (See “12.6AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While the Erase \nSecurity Sector  cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction may still be accessed \nfor checking the status of the WIP bit. The WIP bit is a 1 during the erase cycle and becomes a 0 \nwhen the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept other instructions again. After the \nErase Security Sector  cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register \nis cleared to 0. The Security Sector  Lock Bit ( LB) in the Status Register -2 can be used  to OTP \nprotect  the Security Sector s. Once  the LB bit is set to 1 , the Security Sector  will be permanently \nlocked, Erase Security Sector  instruction will be ignored.  \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               53 \nDI\n(DQ1)DI\n(DQ0)CS#\nCLK\n«=MSBHigh Impedance23     22    2       1       0                                    \n«      Instruction (44h)0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 08       9 \n24-Bit Address29     30     31Mode 3\nMode 0 \nFigure 53 Erase Security Sector  Instruction (SPI Mode only)  \n \n11.35.  Program Security Sector  (42h)  \nThe Program Security Sector  instruction is similar to the Page Program instruction. It allows from \none byte to  256 bytes of Security Sector  data to be programmed at previously erased  (FFh) \nmemory locations. A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the \nProgram Security Sector  Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the CS# pin low then shifting the instruction co de “42h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23-\nA0 and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. The CS# pin must be held low for the entire length \nof the instruction while data is being sent to the device.  \n \nA23-16 A15-10 A9-8 A7-0 \n00h 0 0 0 0  0 0 \n 0 1 \n 1 0 \n 1 1 Byte Address  \n \nThe Program Security Sector  instruction sequence is shown in Figure 54.

Read Security Sector  (48h)  \nThe Read Security Sector  instruction is similar to the Fast Read instruction and allows one or \nmore data bytes to be sequentially read from the Security Sector . The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the CS# pin low and then shifting the instruction code “48h”followed by a 24 -bit address \nA23-A0 and eight “dummy” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the \nrising edge of the CLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory \nlocation will be shifted out on the DO pin at  the falling edge of CLK with most signifi cant bit (MSB) \nfirst. The byte address  is automatically incremented to the next byte address after each byte of \ndata is shifted out. Once the byte address reaches 3FFh ( the last byte of the register), it will be \nreset to 00h  (the first byte of the register ) and continue to increment. The instruction is completed \nby driving CS# high. The Read Security Sector  instruction sequence is shown in Figure 55. If a \nRead Security Sector  instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process \n(WIP =1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effect  on the current cycle. The Read \nSecurity Sector  instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of FR (see “12.6AC \nElectrical Characteristics ”). \n \nA23-16 A15-10 A9-8 A7-0 \n00h 0 0 0 0  0 0 \n 0 1 \n 1 0 \n 1 1 Byte Address  \n \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (48h)CS#\nCLK8       9      10              28     29     30     31 \n24-Bit Address\nDI\n(DQ0)\n«23     22     21               3       2       1       0 \n«=MSBHigh Impedance DI\n(DQ1)\nCS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)0       7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0  \nDummy Byte39     40     41     42     43     44     45     46 47     48     49     50     51     52     53     54    55 31     32     33     34     35     36     37     38 \n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0       7\n« «7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 High Impendance DI\n(DQ1)Data Out 1 Data Out 2\n \nFigure 55 Read Security Sector s Instruction (SPI Mode only)  \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               55 \n11.37.  Set Read Parameters (C0h)  \nIn QPI mode, to accommodate a wide range of applications with different needs for either \nmaximum read frequency or minimum data access latency, “Set Read Parameters (C0h)” \ninstruction can be used to configure the number of dummy clocks for “Fast Read (0Bh)”, “Fast \nRead Quad I/O (EBh)” & “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instructions, and to configure the number \nof bytes of “Wrap Length” for the “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instruction.  \n \nIn Standard SPI mode, the “Set Read Parameters (C0h)” instruction is not accepted. The dummy \nclocks for various Fast Read instructions in Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode are fixed, please refer \nto Table 9 QPI Instructions Set  the Instruction  set for details. The “Wrap Length” is set by W5 -4 bit \nin the “Set Burst with Wrap (77h)” instruction. This setting will remain unchanged when t he device \nis switched from Standard SPI mode to QPI mode.  \n \nThe default “Wrap Length” after a power up or a Reset instruction is 8 bytes, the default number \nof dummy clocks is 2.  \nP5 – P4 DUMMY \nCLOCKS  MAXIMUM READ \nFREQ.  \n00 2 50MHz  \n01 4 80MHz  \n10 6 104MHz \n11 8 104MHz \n P1 – P0 WRAP LENGTH  \n00 8-byte \n01 16-byte \n10 32-byte \n11 64-byte \n \nDQ0CS#\nCLK\nDQ2DQ1\nDQ3   P7     P3   P6     P2P5     P1P4     P0Read\nParametersInstruction\nC0h0       1       2       3  \n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\n \nFigure 56 Set Read Parameters Instruction (QPI Mode only)  \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               56 \n11.38.

Enable Reset (66h) and Reset (99h)  \nBecause of the small package and the limitation on the number of pins, the FM25W32  provide a \nsoftware Reset instruction instead of a dedicated RESET pin. Once the Reset instruction is \naccepted,  any on -going internal operations will be terminated and the device will return to its \ndefault power -on state and lose all the current volatile settings, such as Volatile Status Register \nbits, Write Enable Latch (WEL) status, Read parameter setting P7-P0, Continuous Read Mode bit \nsetting M7-M0 and Wrap Bit setting W6-W4. \n \n“Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” instructions can be issued in either SPI mode or QPI \nmode. To avoid accidental reset, both instructions must be issued in sequence. Any other \ncomma nds other than “Reset (99h)” after the “Enable Reset (66h)” command will disable the \n“Reset Enable” state. A new sequence of “Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” is needed to \nreset the device. Once the Reset command is accepted by the device, the device will take \napproximately t RST=30μs to reset. During this period, no command will be accepted.  \n \nData corruption  may happen if there is an on -going internal Erase or Program operation when \nReset command sequence is  accepted by the device. It is recommended to  check the WIP bit in \nStatus Register before issuing the  Reset command sequence.  \n \nD0\n(DQ1)High ImpedanceDI\n(DQ0)0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (66h)CLK0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (99h)CS#\n \nFigure 60 Enable Reset and Reset Instruction Sequence (SPI Mode)  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\n66hMode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\n99hCS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ3\n \nFigure 61 Enable Reset and Reset Instruction Sequence (QPI Mode)  \n \n           Datasheet  \nFM25W 32 32M -BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY    Ver.1.0               59 \n12.
