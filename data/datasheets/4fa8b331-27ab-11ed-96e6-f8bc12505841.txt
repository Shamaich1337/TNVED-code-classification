It requires few external components and a single\nsupply of 2.7 V–5.5 V. The ac-coupled i nput signals can range\nfrom –60 dBm to 0 dBm in a 50 Ω system, from low frequencies\nup to 2.7 GHz. The outputs provide an accurate measurementof either gain or loss over a ±30 dB range scaled to 30 mV/dB,\nand of phase over a 0 °–180 ° range scaled to 10 mV/degree.\nBoth subsystems have an output bandwidth of 30 MHz, which\nmay optionally be reduced by the addition of external f ilter\ncapacitors. The AD8302 can be used in controller mode to\nforce the gain and phase of a signal chain toward predetermined\nsetpoints.\nThe AD8302 comprises a closely matched pair of demodulating\nlogarithmic amplifiers, each having a 60 dB measurement range.By taking the difference of their outputs, a measurement of\nthe magnitude ratio or gain betw een the two input signals is\navailable. These signals may even be at different frequencies,\nallowing the measurement of conversion gain or loss. The AD 8302\nmay be used to determine absolute signal level by applying theunknown signal to one input and a calibrated ac reference signalto the other. With the output stage feedback connection dis-\nabled, a com parator may be realized, using the setpoint pins\nMSET and PSET to program the thresholds.The signal inputs are single-ended, allowing them to be matchedand connected directly to a directional coupler. T heir input\nimpedance is nominally 3 k Ω at low frequencies.\nThe AD8302 includes a phase detector of the multiplier type,\nbut with precise phase balance driven by the fully limited signals\nappearing at the outputs of the two logarithmic amplifiers.\nThus, the phase accuracy measurement is independent of signallevel over a wide range.\nThe phase and gain output voltages are simultaneously available\nat loadable ground referenced outputs over the standard output\nrange of 0 V to 1.8 V. The output drivers can source or sink upto 8 mA. A loadable, stable reference voltage of 1.8 V is avail-\nable for precise repositioning of the output range by the user.\nIn controller applications, the connection between the gain\noutput pin VMAG and the setpoint control pin MSET is broken.The desired setpoint is presented to MSET and the VMAG\ncontrol signal drives an appropriate external variable gain device.\nLikewise, the feedback path between the phase output pin VPHSand its setpoint control pin PSET may be broken to allow\noperation as a phase controller.\nThe AD8302 is fabricated on Analog Devices’ proprietary, high\nperformance 25 GHz SOI complementary bipolar IC process. It isavailable in a 14-lead TSSOP package and operates over a –40 °C\nto +85 °C temperature range. An evaluation board is available.\nREV. B\nOne  Te chn ology Way, P.O.

B \nAD8302\n–15–GENERAL DESCRIPTION AND THEORY\nThe AD8302 measures the magnitude ratio, defined here as\ngain, and phase difference between two signals. A pair of\nmatched logarithmic amplifiers provide the measurement, andtheir hard-limited outputs drive the phase detector.\nBasic Theory\nLogarithmic amplifiers (log amps) provide a logarithmic com-pression function that converts a large range of input signallevels to a compact decibel-scaled output. The general math-\nematical form is:\n    VV V VOUT SLP IN Z = ()log / (1)\nwhere  VIN is the input voltage, VZ is called the intercept (voltage),\nand VSLP is called the slope (voltage). It is assumed throughout\nthat log(x) represents the log10(x) function. VSLP is thus the\nvolts/decade, and since a decade of voltage corresponds to\n20 dB, VSLP/20 is the volts/dB. VZ is the value of input\nsignal that results in an output of zero and need not correspond\nto a physically realizable part of the log amp signal range.\nWhile the slope is fundamentally a characteristic of the log amp,the intercept is a function of the input waveform as well.\n1\nFurthermore, the intercept is typica lly more sensitive to tem-\nperature and frequency than the slope. When single log ampsare used for power measurement, this variability introduces\nerrors into the absolute accuracy of the measurement since theintercept represents a reference level.\nThe AD8302 takes the difference in the output of two identical\nlog amps, each driven by signals of similar waveforms but atdifferent levels. Since subtraction in the logarithmic domaincorresponds to a ratio in the linear domain, the resulting\noutput becomes:\n    VV V VMAG SLP INA INB = ()log / (2)\nwhere VINA and VINB are the input voltages, VMAG is the output\ncorresponding to the magnitude of the signal level difference,\nand VSLP is the slope. Note that the intercept, VZ, has dropped\nout. Unlike the measurement of power, when measuring a dimen-sionless quantity such as relative signal level, no independent\nreference or intercept need be invoked. In essence, one signalserves as the intercept for the other. Variations in intercept dueto frequency, process, temperature, and supply voltage affect bothchannels identically and hence do not affect the difference. Thistechnique depends on the two log amps being well matchedin slope and intercept to ensure cancellation. This is the case\nfor an integrated pair of log amps. N ote that if the two signals\nhave different waveforms (e.g., diffe rent peak-to-average ratios)\nor different frequencies, an interc ept difference may appear, intro-\nducing a systematic offset.\nThe log amp structure consists of a cascade of linear/limiting\ngain stages with demodulating detectors. Further details aboutthe structure and function of log amps can be found in datasheets for other log amps produced by Analog Devices.\n2 The\noutput of the final stage of a log amp is a fully limited signalover most of the input dynamic range. The limited outputs fromboth log amps drive an exclusive-OR style digital phase detector.Operating strictly on the relative zero-crossings of the limited sig-\nnals, the extracted phase difference is independent of the original\ninput signal levels. The phase output has the general form:  VV V VPHS INA INB = () −() []ΦΦΦ (3)\nwhere VΦ is the phase slope in mV/degree and Φ is each signal’ s\nrelative phase in degrees.\nStructure\nThe general form of the AD8302 is shown in Figure 2. The\nmajor blocks consist of two demodulating log amps, a phase\ndetector, output amplifiers, a biasing cell, and an output refer-\nence voltage buffer. The log amps and phase detector processthe high frequency signals and deliver the gain and phase infor-mation in current form to the output amplifiers. The outputamplifiers determine the final gain and phase scaling. Externalfilter capacitors set the averaging time constants for the respec-\ntive outputs. The reference buffer provides a 1.80 V referencevoltage that tracks the internal scaling constants.\nMFLT\nVMAG\nMSET\nPSET\nVPHS\nPFLT\nVREFVIDEO OUTPUT – A\nINPA\nOFSA\nCOMM\nOFSB\nINPB\nVPOS+\n–+\n–60dB LOG AMPS\n(7 DETECTORS)\n60dB LOG AMPS\n(7 DETECTORS)\nVIDEO OUTPUT – BPHASE\nDETECTOR\n+–\nBIAS x3\n1.8V\nFigure 2. General Structure\nEach log amp consists of a cascade of six 10 dB gain stages with\nseven associated detectors. The individual gain stages have 3 dB\nbandwidths in excess of 5 GHz. The signal path is fully differen-\ntial to minimize the effect of common-mode signals and noise.Since there is a total of 60 dB of cascaded gain, slight dc offsets\ncan cause limiting of the latter stages, which may cause mea-\nsurement errors for small signals. \nThis is corrected by a feedback\nloop.  The nominal high-pass corner frequency, f HP, of this loop\nis set internally at 200 MHz but can be lowered by adding externalcapacitance to the OFSA and OFSB pins. Signals at frequencies\nwell below the high-pass corner are indistinguishable  from dc\noffsets and are also nulled. The difference in the log amp out-puts is performed in the current domain, yielding by analogy to\nEquation 2:\n    II V VLA SLP INA INB= ()log / (4)\nwhere ILA and ISLP are the output current difference and the\ncharacteristic slope (current) of the log amps, respectively. The\nslope is derived from an accurate reference designed to be insen-\nsitive to temperature and supply voltage.\nThe phase detector uses a fully symmetric structure with respect\nto its two inputs to maintain balanced delays along both signalpaths. Fully differential signaling again minimizes the sensitivity\nto common-mode perturbations. The current-mode equivalent\nto Equation 3 is:\n  II V VPD INA INB = () −() −° []ΦΦΦ 90 (5)\nwhere IPD and IΦ are the output current and characteristic slope\nassociated with the phase detector, respectively. The slope is\nderived from the same reference as the log amp slope.NOTES\n1See the data sheet for the AD640 for a description of the effect of waveform on\nthe intercept of log amps.\n2For example, see the data sheet for the AD8307.\nREV.  B \nAD8302\n–16–Note that by convention, the phase difference is taken in the range\nfrom –180° to +180 °. Since this style of phase detector does not\ndistinguish between ±90°, it is considered to have an unambiguous\n180° phase difference range that can be either 0 ° to +180 ° centered\nat +90 ° or 0° to –180° centered at – 90°.\nThe basic structure of both output interfaces is shown in Figure 3. It\naccepts a setpoint input and includes an internal integrating/averag-\ning capacitor and a buffer amplifier with gain K. External access tothese setpoints provides for several modes of operation and enables\nflexible tailoring of the gain and phase transfer characteristics. The\nsetpoint interface block, characterized by a transresistance R\nF, gener-\nates a current proportional to the voltage presented to its input pin,\nMSET or PSET. A precise offset voltage of 900 mV is introduced\ninternally to establish the center-point (V CP) for the gain and phase\nfunctions, i.e., the setpoint voltage that corresponds to a gain of 0 dB\nand a phase difference of 90 °. This setpoint current is subtracted\nfrom the signal current, I IN, coming from the log amps in the gain\nchannel or from the phase detector in the phase channel. The result-ing difference is integrated on the averaging capacitors at either pin\nMFLT or PFLT and then buffered by the output amplifier to therespective output pins, VMAG and VPHS. With this open-loop\narrangement, the output voltage is a simple integration of the differ-\nence between the measured gain/phase and the desired setpoint:\n    VR I I s TOUT F IN FB =−() ( ) / (6)\nwhere IFB is the feedback current equal to ( VSET – V CP)/RF, VSET\nis the setpoint input, and T is the integration time constant equal\nto R FCAVE/K, where C AVE is the parallel combination of the inter-\nnal 1.5 pF and the external capacitor C FLT.\nK\nRF MSET/PSET\n20k/H9024+\n+VCP = 900mV1.5pF\nCFLTMFLT/PFLT\nVMAG/VPHS IIN = ILA OR IPD\nIFB+\n–\nFigure 3. Simplified Block Diagram of the Output Interface\nBASIC CONNECTIONS\nMeasurement Mode\nThe basic function of the AD8302 is the direct measurement of gain\nand phase. When the output pins, VMAG and VPHS, are connected\ndirectly to the feedback setpoint input pins, MSET and PSET, thedefault slopes and center points are invoked. This basic connection\nshown in Figure 4 is termed the measurement mode. The current\nfrom the setpoint interface is forced by the integrator to be equal tothe signal currents coming from the log amps and phase detector.\nThe closed loop transfer function is thus given by:\n    VI R V / s TOUT IN F CP=+() +()1 (7)\nThe time constant T represents the single-pole response to the enve-\nlope of the dB-scaled gain and the degree-scaled phase functions.

Idealized Transfer Characteristics for the Gain\nand Phase Measurement Mode\nREV. B\nAD8302\n–17–Interfacing to the Input Channels\nThe single-ended input interfaces for both channels are identical.\nEach consists of a driving pin, INPA and INPB, and an ac-\ngrounding pin, OFSA and OFSB. All four pins are internally\ndc-biased at about 100 mV from the positive supply and shouldbe externally ac-coupled to the input signals and to ground. For\nthe signal pins, the coupling capacitor should offer negligible\nimpedance at the signal frequency. For the grounding pins, thecoupling capacitor has two functions: It provides ac grounding\nand sets the high-pass corner frequency for the internal offset\ncompensation loop. There is an internal 10 pF capacitor to groundthat sets the maximum corner to approximately 200 MHz.\nThe corner can be lowered according the formula f\nHP (MHz) =\n2/C C(nF), where C C is the total capacitance from OFSA or OFSB\nto ground, including the internal 10 pF.\nThe input impedance to INPA and INPB is a function offrequency, the offset compensation capacitor, and package\nparasitics. At moderate frequencies above f\nHP, the input network\ncan be approximated by a shunt 3 k Ω resistor in parallel with a\n2 pF capacitor. At higher frequencies, the shunt resistancedecreases to approximately 500 Ω. The Smith Chart in Figure 6\nshows the input impedance over the frequency range 100 MHz\nto 3 GHz.\n2.2GHz\n2.7GHz\n3.0GHz1.8GHz900MHz100MHz\nFigure 6. Smith Chart Showing the Input Impedance of a\nSingle Channel from 100 MHz to 3 GHz\nA broadband resistive termination on the signal side of the coupling\ncapacitors can be used to match to a given source i mpedance.\nThe value of the termination resistor, RT, is determined by:\n    RR R R RT IN S IN S=− ()/ (10)\nwhere RIN is the input resistance and RS the source impedance.\nAt higher frequencies, a reactive, narrow-band match might be\ndesirable to tune out the reactive portion of the input impedance.An important attribute of the two-log-amp architecture is t hat if\nboth channels are at the same frequency and have the same input\nnetwork, then impedance mismatches and reflection losses become\nessentially common-mode and hence do not impact the relative\ngain and phase measurement. However, mismatches in these\nexternal components can result in measurement errors.Dynamic Range\nThe maximum measurement range for the gain subsystem is lim-ited to a total of 60 dB distributed from – 30 dB to +30 dB. This\nmeans that both gain and attenuation can be measured. The limitsare determined by the minimum and maximum levels that eachindividual log amp can detect. In the AD8302, each log amp can\ndetect inputs ranging from – 73 dBV [(223 µV, –60 dBm re: 50 Ω\nto –13 dBV (223 mV, 0 dBm re: 50 Ω)]. Note that log\namps respond to voltages and not power. An equivalent power\ncan be inferred given an impedance level, e.g., to convert from\ndBV to dBm in a 50 Ω system, simply add 13 dB. To cover\nthe entire range, it is necessary to apply a reference level to one log\namp that corresponds precisely to its midrange. In the AD8302,this level is at – 43 dBV, which corresponds to – 30 dBm in a 50 Ω\nenvironment. The other channel can now sweep from its low end,\n30 dB below midrange, to its high end, 30 dB above midrange. If\nthe reference is displaced from midrange, some measurementrange will be lost at the extremes. This can occur either if the log\namps run out of range or if the rails at ground or 1.8 V are reached.\nFigure 7 illustrates the effect of the reference channel level place ment.\nIf the reference is chosen lower than midrange by 10 dB, then the\nlower limit will be at –20 dB rather than –30 dB. If the reference chosen\nis higher by 10 dB, the upper limit will be 20 dB rather than 30 dB.\nGAIN MEASUREMENT RANGE – dB–30   0 +301.80\n0.90VMAG – VMAX RANGE FOR VREF = V REFOPT\nVREF > V REFOPTVREF < V REFOPT\nFigure 7. The Effect of Offsetting the Reference Level Is to\nReduce the Maximum Dynamic Range\nThe phase measurement range is of 0 ° to 180 °. For phase differ-\nences of 0 ° to –180°, the transfer characteristics are mirrored as\nshown in Figure 5, with a slope of the opposite sign. The phase\ndetector responds to the relative position of the zero crossingsbetween the two input channels. At higher frequencies, the finite\nrise and fall times of the amplitude limited inputs create an\nambiguous situation that leads to inaccessible dead zones at the0° and 180 ° limits. For maximum phase difference coverage, the\nreference phase difference should be set to 90 °.\nREV. B\nAD8302\n–18–Cross Modulation of Magnitude and Phase\nAt high frequencies, unintentional cross coupling between signals\nin Channels A and B inevitably occurs due to on-chip and board-\nlevel parasitics. When the two signals presented to the AD8302\ninputs are at very different levels, the cross coupling introducescross modulation of the phase and magnitude responses. If the two\nsignals are held at the same relative levels and the phase between\nthem is modulated then only the phase output should respond.Due to phase-to-amplitude cross modulation, the magnitude out-\nput shows a residual response. A similar effect occurs when the\nrelative phase is held constant while the magnitude difference ismodulated, i.e., an expected magnitude response and a residual\nphase response are observed due to amplitude-to-phase cross\nmodulation. The point where these effects are noticeable dependson the signal frequency and the magnitude of the difference. Typi-\ncally, for differences <20 dB, the effects of cross modulation are\nnegligible at 900 MHz.\nModifying the Slope and Center Point\nThe default slope and center point values can be modified with\nthe addition of external resistors. Since the output interface\nblocks are generalized for both magnitude and phase functions,\nthe scaling modification techniques are equally valid for both\noutputs. Figure 8 demonstrates how a simple voltage divider\nfrom the VMAG and VPHS pins to the MSET and PSET pinscan be used to modify the slope. The increase in slope is given by\n1 + R1/(R2 /H2064820 kΩ). Note that it may be necessary to account for\nthe MSET and PSET input impedance of 20 k Ω which has a ±20%\nmanufacturing tolerance. As is generally true in such feedbacksystems, envelope bandwidth is decreased and the output noise\ntransferred from the input is increased by the same factor. Forexample, by selecting R1 and R2 to be 10 k Ω and 20 k Ω,\nrespectively, gain slope increases from the nominal 30 mV/dBby a factor of 2 to 60 mV/dB. The range is reduced by a factorof 2 and the new center point is at –15 dB, i.e., the range now\nextends  from – 30 dB, corresponding to V MAG = 0 V, to 0 dB,\ncorresponding to V MAG = 1.8 V.\nNEW SLOPE = 30mV/dB /H11547 1/H11545R1\nR2||R20k/H9024VMAG\nMSET\n20k/H9024R1\nR2\nFigure 8. Increasing the Slope Requires the Inclusion of a\nVoltage Divider\nRepositioning the center point back to its original value of 0 dB\nsimply requires that an appropriate voltage be applied to the\ngrounded side of the lower resistor in the voltage divider. This\nvoltage may be provided externally or derived from the internal\nreference voltage on pin VREF. For the specific choice of R2 =\n20 kΩ, the center point is easily readjusted to 0 dB by connecting\nthe VREF pin directly to the lower pin of R2 as shown in Figure 9.\nThe increase in slope is now simplified to 1 + R1/10 k Ω. Since this\n1.80 V reference voltage is derived from the same band gapreference that determines the nominal center point, their\ntracking with temperature, supply, and part-to-part variationsshould be better in comparison to a fixed external voltage. If the\ncenter point is shifted to 0 dB in the previous example w here\nthe slope was doubled, then the range spans from –15 dB at\nV\nMAG = 0 V to 15 dB at V MAG = 1.8 V.\n1/H11545R1\n 10k/H9024NEW SLOPE = 30mV/dB /H11547\nVMAG\nMSET\n20k/H9024R1\n20k/H9024\nVREF\nFigure 9.

By Applying Overall Feedback to a DUT Via\nExternal Gain and Phase Adjusters, the AD8302 Acts\nas a Controller\nAPPLICATIONS\nMeasuring Amplifier Gain and Compression\nThe most fundamental application of AD8302 is the monitoring\nof the gain and phase response of a functional circuit block such as\nan amplifier or a mixer. As illustrated in Figure 12, directionalcouplers, DC\nB and DC A, sample the input and output signals of\nthe “Black Box”  DUT. The attenuators ensure that the signal\nlevels presented to the AD8302 fall within its dynamic range.From the discussion in the Dynamic Range section, the optimal\nchoice places both channels at P\nOPT = –30 dBm referenced to 50 Ω,\nwhich corresponds to –43 dBV. To achieve this, the combination\nof coupling factor and attenuation are given by:\n  CLP PB B IN OPT+= − (15)\n(16)\nwhere CB and CA are the coupling coefficients, LB and LA are the\nattenuation factors, and GAIN NOM is the nominal DUT gain. If\nidentical couplers are used for both ports, then the difference in the\ntwo attenuators compensates for the nominal DUT gain. When theactual gain is nominal, the VMAG output is 900 mV, corresponding\nto 0 dB. Variations from nominal gain appear as a deviation from\n900 mV or 0 dB with a 30 mV/dB scaling. Depending on the nominal\ninsertion phase associated with DUT, the phase measurement may\nrequire a fixed phase shift in series with one of the channels to bring\nthe nominal phase difference presented to the AD8302 near theoptimal 90 ° point.When the insertion phase is nominal, the VPHS output is 900 mV.Deviat ions from the nominal are reported with a 10 mV/degree\nscaling. Table I gives suggested component values for the\nmeasurement of an amplifier with a nominal gain of 10 dB andan input power of –10 dBm.\nATTENA\nDCA\nATTENBDCBR5H\nR6H“BLACK BOX”\nOUTPUT INPUT1COMM MFLT 14\nINPA VMAG21 3\nOFSA MSET31 2\nVPOS VREF41 1\nOFSB PSET51 0\nINPB VPHS69\nCOMM PFLT78AD8302\nC2\nC8C1\nC4\nC6\nC5R1\nR2VP\nC7\nR4\nC3\nFigure 12.

In this case, the nominal gain and phasecorresponds to those at low input signal levels. As the input level\nis increased, output compression and excess phase shifts are\nmeasured as deviations from the low level case.

B\nAD8302\n–20–Reflectometer\nThe AD8302 can be configured to measure the magnitude ratio\nand phase difference of signals that are incident on and reflected\nfrom a load. The vector reflection coefficient, /H9003, is defined as,\n  Γ= = −() +() Reflected Voltage / Incident Voltage Z Z / Z ZLO LO (17)\nwhere ZL is the complex load impedance and ZO is the charac-\nteristic system impedance.\nThe measured reflection coefficient can be used to calculate the\nlevel of impedance mismatch or standing wave ratio (SWR) of a\nparticular load condition. This proves particularly useful in diag-\nnosing varying load impedances such as antennas that can degrade\nperformance and even cause physical damage. The vectorreflectom eter arrangement given in Figure 13 consists of a pair\nof directional couplers that sample the incident and reflected sig-\nnals. The attenuators reposition the two signal levels within thedynamic range of the AD8302. In analogy to Equations 15 and\n16, the attenuation factors and coupling coefficients are given by:\n  CLP PB B IN OPT+= − (18)\n  CLP PA A IN NOM OPT+= + − Γ (19)\nwhere /H9003NOM is the nominal reflection coefficient in dB and is\nnegative for passive loads. Consider the case where the incident\nsignal is 10 dBm and the nominal reflection coefficient is –19 dB.\nAs shown in Figure 13, using 20 dB couplers on both sides and\n–30 dBm for POPT, the attenuators for Channel A and B paths\nare 1 dB and 20 dB, respectively. The magnitude and phase of\nthe reflection coefficient are available at the VMAG and VPHS\npins scaled to 30 mV/dB and 10 mV/degree. When /H9003 is –19 dB,\nthe VMAG output is 900 mV.The measurement accuracy can be compromised if board\nlevel details are not addressed. Minimize the physical distance\nbetween the series connected couplers since the extra path\nlength adds phase error to /H9003. Keep the paths from the couplers\nto the AD8302 as well matched as possible since any differences\nintroduce measurement errors. The finite directivity, D, of the\ncouplers sets the minimum detectable reflection coefficient, i.e.,\n|ΓMIN(dB)|<|D(dB)|.\nSOURCE\n1dB\nC1 C4 C6 C5\nVP\nC7R4R1 R220dBINCIDENT\nWAVEREFLECTED\nWAVEZLOAD\nR5/H9003\nR6/H90031COMM MFLT 14\nINPA VMAG21 3\nOFSA MSET31 2\nVPOS VREF41 1\nOFSB PSET51 0\nINPB VPHS69\nCOMM PFLT78AD8302 C2\nC8C3\nFigure 13.

The characterization board\nis similar to the Customer Evaluation Board. Two reference- locked\nR and S SMT03 signal generators are used as the inputs toINPA and INPB, while the gain and phase outputs are monitored\nusing both a TDS 744A oscilloscope with 10 × high impedance\nprobes and Agilent 34401A multimeters.\nGain\nThe basic technique used to evaluate the static gain (VMAG)performance was to set one source to a fixed level and sweep the\namplitude of the other source, while measuring the VMAG output\nwith the DMM. In practice, the two sources were run at 100 kHz\nfrequency offset and average output measured with the DMM toalleviate errors that might be induced by gain/phase modulationdue to phase jitter between the two sources.\nThe errors stated are the difference between a best fit line calcu-\nlated by a linear regression and the actual measured data divided\nby the slope of the line to give an error in V/dB. The referred to25°C error uses this same method while always using the slope\nand intercept calculated for that device at 25 °C.\nResponse measurement made of the VMAG output used theconfiguration shown in Figure 17. The variable attenuator,Alpha AD260, is driven with a HP8112A pulse generator pro-\nducing a change in RF level within 10 ns.\nNoise spectral density measurements were made using a\nHP3589A with the inputs delivered through a Narda 4032C90° phase splitter.\nTo measure the modulation of VMAG due to phase variation\nagain the sources were run at a frequency offset, f\nOS, effectively\ncreating a continuous linear change in phase going through 360 °\nonce every 1/f OS seconds. The VMAG output is then measured\nwith a DSO. When perceivable, only at high frequencies and\nlarge input magnitude differences, the linearly ramping phasecreates a near sinusoid output riding on the expected VMAG dc\noutput level. The curves in TPC 24 show the peak-to-peak out-\nput level measured with averaging.Phase\nThe majority of the VPHS output data was collected by generatingphase change, again by operating the two input sources with a\nsmall frequency offset (normally 100 kHz) using the same\nconfiguration shown in Figure 16. Although this method givesexcellent linear phase change, good for measurement of slope\nand linearity, it lacks an absolute phase reference point. In the\ncurves showing swept phase, the phase at which the VPHS is thesame as VPHS with no input signal is taken to be –90° and all\nother angles are references to there. Typical Performance Curvesshow two figures of merit; instantaneous slope and error. Instanta-neous slope, as shown in TPCs 43, 44, 45, and 47, was calculated\nsimply by taking the delta in VPHS over angular change for adjacent\nmeasurement points.\nTEKTRONIX\nTDS 744AOSCILLOSCOPE\nMULTIMETER/OSCILLOSCOPE\nINPA\nINPBVMAG\nVREF\nVPHSEVB3dBR & S\nSIGNAL GENERATORSMTO3TEKTRONIX\nVX1410A\n3dBR & SSIGNAL GENERATORSMTO3HP 34401AMULTIMETER\nSAME SETUP AS\nVMAG\nFigure 16.
