Connect this pin to \nan external resistive divider from OUT. If the voltage falls \nbelow 0.6V, the current limit is reduced using a foldback \nprofile (see the Typical Performance Characteristics sec -\ntion). If  the voltage falls below 1.21V, the PG pin will pull \nlow to indicate the power is bad.\nF\nLT: Overcurrent Fault Indicator. Open-drain output pulls \nlow when an overcurrent fault has occurred and the circuit \nbreaker trips. For overcurrent auto-retry tie to UV pin (see \nthe Applications Information section for details).\nGATE: Gate Drive for Internal N-channel MOSFET. An \ninternal 24µA current source charges the gate of the N\n-channel \nMOSFET. At start-up the GATE pin ramps up at \na 0.3V/ms rate determined by internal circuitry. During an undervoltage or overvoltage condition a 250µA pull-down \ncurrent turns the MOSFET off. During a short-circuit or \nundervoltage lockout condition, a 140mA pull-down cur -\nrent source between GATE and OUT is activated.\nGND:\n Device Ground.\nIMON: Current Monitor Output. The current in the internal \nMOSFET switch is divided by 50,000 and sourced from this \npin. Placing a 20k resistor from this pin to  GND  creates a \n0V \nto 2V voltage swing when current ranges from 0A to 5A.\nINTV CC: Internal 3.1V Supply Decoupling Output. This pin \nmust have a 1µF or larger bypass capacitor. Overloading \nthis pin can disrupt internal operation.I\nSET: Current Limit Adjustment Pin. For a 5.6A current limit \nvalue open this pin. This pin is driven by a 20k resistor \nin series with a voltage source. The pin voltage is used \nto generate the current limit threshold. The internal 20k \nresistor (R ISET) and an external resistor (R SET) between \nISET and ground create an attenuator that lowers the current  \nlimit value. Due to circuit tolerance, R SET should not be \nless than 2k. In order to match the temperature variation \nof the sense resistor, the voltage on this pin increases at \nthe same rate as the sense resistance increases. Therefore \nthe voltage at I SET pin is made proportional to temperature \nof the MOSFET switch.OUT: Output of Internal MOSFET Switch. Connect this pin \ndirectly to the load.\nOV: Overvoltage Comparator Input. Connect this pin to an \nexternal resistive divider from V DD. If the voltage at this \npin rises above 1.235V, an overvoltage is detected and \nthe switch turns off. Tie  to GND if unused.\nPG:\n Power Good Indicator. Open-drain output pulls low \nwhen the FB pin drops below 1.21V indicating the power is \nbad. If the FB pin rises above 1.23V and the GATE to OUT \nvoltage exceeds 4.2V, the open-drain pull-down releases the PG pin to go high.\nSENSE: Current Sense Node and MOSFET Drain. The cur -\nrent limit  circuit controls the GATE pin to limit the sense \nvoltage \nbetween the V DD and SENSE pins to 42mV (5.6A) \nor less depending on the voltage at the FB pin. The exposed \npad on DHC packages are connected to SENSE and must \nbe soldered to an electrically isolated printed circuit board \ntrace to properly transfer the heat out of the package.TIMER: Timer Input. Connect a capacitor between this pin \nand ground to set a 12ms/µF duration for current limit \nbefore the switch is turned off. If the UV pin is toggled \nlow while the MOSFET switch is off, the switch will turn \non again following a cooldown time of 518ms/µF duration. \nTie this pin to INTV\nCC for a fixed 2ms overcurrent delay \nand 100ms auto-retry time.\nUV: Under voltage Comparator Input. Ti e high if unused. \nConnect this pin to an external resistive divider from V DD. \nIf the UV pin voltage falls below 1.15V, an undervoltage is \ndetected and the switch turns off. Pulling this pin below \n0.62V resets the overcurrent fault and allows the switch \nto turn back on (see the Applications Information section \nfor details). If overcurrent auto-retry is desired then tie \nthis pin to the F LT  pin.\nVDD: Supply Voltage and Current Sense Input.

The LTC4232 is designed to turn a board’s supply \nvoltage on and off in a controlled manner allowing the board  \nto be safely inserted and removed from a live backplane. \nThe LTC4232 includes a 25mΩ MOSFET and a 7.5mΩ cur -\nrent sense  resistor. During normal operation, the charge \npump \nand gate driver turn on the pass MOSFET’s gate to \nprovide power to the load. The inrush current control is \naccomplished by the INRUSH circuit. This circuit limits \nthe GATE ramp rate to 0.3V/ms and hence controls the \nvoltage ramp rate of the output capacitor.\nThe current sense (CS) amplifier monitors the load current \nusing the voltage sensed across the current sense resistor. \nThe CS amplifier limits the current in the load by reduc -\ning the GATE-to-OUT voltage in an active control loop. It \nis \nsimple to adjust the current limit threshold using the \ncurrent limit adjustment (I SET) pin. This allows a different \nthreshold during other times such as start-up.\nA short circuit on the output to ground causes significant \npower dissipation during active current limiting. To limit \nthis power, the foldback amplifier  reduces the current \nlimit value from 5.6A to 1.5A in a linear manner as the \nFB pin drops below 0.6V (see the Typical Performance Characteristics section).\nIf an overcurrent condition persists, the TIMER pin ramps \nup with a  100µA current source until the pin voltage exceeds  \n1.235V (comparator TM2). This indicates to the logic that \nit is time to turn off the pass MOSFET to prevent overheat -\ning. At  this point the TIMER pin ramps down using the 2µA \ncurrent source until the voltage drops below 0.21V \n(Comparator TM1) which tells the logic to start an internal \n100ms timer. At this point, the pass transistor has cooled \nand it is safe to turn it on again. It is suitable for many \napplications to use an internal 2ms overcurrent timer with \na 100ms cooldown period. Tying the TIMER pin to INTV CC \nsets this default timing. Latchoff is the normal operating \ncondition following overcurrent turnoff. Retry is initiated \nby pulling the UV pin low for a minimum of 1µs then high. \nAuto retry is implemented by tying the F LT to the UV pin.\nThe output voltage is monitored using the FB pin and the \nPG comparator to determine  if the power is available for \nthe \nload. The power good condition is signaled by the PG \npin using an open-drain pull-down transistor.The Functional Diagram also shows the monitoring blocks \nof the LTC4232. The two comparators on the left side \ninclude the UV and OV comparators. These comparators \ndetermine if the external conditions are valid prior to turning  \non the MOSFET. But first the undervoltage lockout circuits \nUVLO1 and UVLO2 must validate the input supply and \nthe internally generated 3.1V supply (INTV\nCC) and gener-\nate the  power up initialization to the logic circuits. If the \nexternal \nconditions remain valid for 100ms the MOSFET \nis allowed to turn on.\nOther features include MOSFET current and temperature \nmonitoring. The current monitor (CM) outputs a current \nproportional to the sense resistor current. This current can \ndrive an external resistor or other circuits for monitoring purposes. A voltage proportional to the MOSFET tempera -\nture is  output to the I\nSET pin. The MOSFET is protected by \na thermal shutdown circuit.\nLTC42329\n4232fc For more information www.linear .com/L TC4232applica Tions inForMaTion\nThis gate slope is designed to charge up a 1000µF capaci-\ntor to  12V in 40ms, with an inrush current of 300mA. This \nallows the inrush current to stay under the current limit \nthreshold (1.5A) for capacitors less than 1000µF. Included \nin the Typical Performance Characteristics section is a \ngraph of the Safe Operating Area for the MOSFET. It is \nevident from this graph that the power dissipation at 12V, \n300mA for 40ms is in the safe region.\nAdding the R GATE, CGATE and C COMP  network on the GATE \npin will lower the inrush current below the default value \nset by the INRUSH circuit. The GATE is charged with an \n24µA current source (when INRUSH circuit is not driving \nthe GATE). The voltage at the GATE pin rises with a slope \nequal to 24µA/C GATE and the supply inrush current is set at:\n  IINRUSH=CL\nCGATE•24µA\nWhen the GATE voltage reaches the MOSFET threshold \nvoltage, the switch begins to turn on and the OUT volt-\nage follows  the GATE voltage as it increases. Once OUT \nreaches \nVDD, the GATE will ramp up until clamped by the \n6.15V Zener between GATE and OUT.\nAs the OUT voltage rises, so will the FB pin which is moni -\ntoring it. Once the FB pin crosses its 1.235V threshold \nand \nthe GATE to OUT voltage exceeds 4.2V, the PG pin \nwill cease to pull low and indicate that the power is good.\nParasitic MOSFET OscillationWhen the N-channel MOSFET ramps up the output during \npower-up it operates as a source follower. The source \nfollower configuration may self-oscillate in the range of \n25kHz to 300kHz when the load capacitance is less than Figure 1. 2A, 12V Card Resident ApplicationThe typical LTC4232 application is in a high availability \nsystem that uses a positive voltage supply to distribute \npower to individual cards. A complete application circuit \nis shown in Figure 1. External component selection is \ndiscussed in detail in the following sections.\nt1 t2SLOPE = 0.3[V/ms]GATE\nOUTVDD + 6.15V\nVDD\n4232 F02\nTurn-On Sequence\nSeveral conditions must be present before the internal  \npass MOSFET can be turned on. First the supply V DD must  \nexceed its undervoltage lockout level. Next the internally  \ngenerated supply INTV CC must cross its 2.65V undervolt -\nage threshold . This generates a  25µs power- on-reset pulse  \nwhich clears the fault register and initializes internal latches.\nAfter the power-on-reset pulse, the UV and OV pins must \nindicate that the input voltage is within the acceptable range. \nAll of these conditions must be satisfied for the duration \nof 100ms to ensure that any contact bounce during the \ninsertion has ended.\nThe MOSFET is turned on by charging up the GATE with \na charge pump generated 24µA current source whose \nvalue is adjusted by shunting a portion of the pull-up cur -\nrent to  ground. The charging current is controlled by the \nINRUSH \ncircuit that maintains a constant slope of GATE \nvoltage versus time (Figure 2). The voltage at the GATE \npin rises with a slope of 0.3[V/ms] and the supply inrush \ncurrent is set at:\n IINRUSH  = C L • 0.3[V/ms]ADCR1\n226k\nC11µFR220k12V\n4232 F01CT\n0.1µFCL\n330µFVOUT\n12V2A\nUV = 9.88VOV = 15.2VPG = 10.5VVDD\nUVOUT\nFB\nPG\nGNDIMONRSET\n20k\nRMON\n20kISETCGATE\n0.1µFRGATE\n100kGATEL TC4232\nOV\nINTV CCTIMERF LT+ R3\n140k\nR4\n20kR710kR620kR5\n150kZ1*\n*TVS Z1: DIODES INC.

Supply Turn-On\nLTC423210\n4232fc For more information www.linear .com/L TC4232applica Tions inForMaTion\nAn overcurrent fault occurs when the current limit circuitry \nhas been engaged for longer than the timeout delay set \nby the TIMER. Current limiting begins when the MOSFET \ncurrent reaches 1.5A to 5.6A (depending on the foldback). The GATE pin is then brought down with a 140mA GATE-\nto-OUT current. The voltage on the GATE is regulated in \norder to limit the current to less than 5.6A. At this point, \na circuit breaker time delay starts by charging the external \ntiming capacitor with a 100µA pull-up current from the \nTIMER pin. If the TIMER pin reaches its 1.235V threshold, \nthe internal switch turns off (with a 250µA current from \nGATE to ground). Included in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics curves is a graph of the Safe Operating \nArea for the MOSFET. From this graph one can determine \nthe MOSFET’s maximum time in current limit for a given \noutput power.\nTying the TIMER pin to INTV\nCC will force the part to use \nthe internally generated (circuit breaker) delay of 2ms. \nIn either case the F LT pin is pulled low to indicate an \novercurrent fault has turned off the pass MOSFET. For a \ngiven circuit breaker time delay, the  equation for setting \nthe timing capacitor’s value is as follows:\n CT = tCB • 0.083[µF/ms]\nAfter the switch is turned off, the TIMER pin begins dis-\ncharging the  timing capacitor with a 2µA pull-down cur-\nrent. \nWhen  the TIMER pin reaches its 0.21V threshold, an \ninternal\n 100ms timer is started. After the 100ms delay, the \nswitch is allowed to turn on again if the overcurrent fault \nlatch has been cleared. Bringing the UV pin below 0.6V \nfor a minimum of 1µs and then high will clear the fault latch. If the TIMER pin is tied to INTV\nCC then the switch is \nallowed to turn on again (after an internal 100ms delay), if the overcurrent fault latch is cleared.\nTying the F LT pin to the UV pin allows the part to self-clear \nthe fault and turn the MOSFET on as soon as TIMER pin \nhas ramped below 0.21V. In this auto-retry mode the \nLTC4232 repeatedly tries to turn on after an overcurrent \nat a period determined by the capacitor on the TIMER pin. \nThe auto-retry mode also functions when the TIMER pin \nis tied to INTV\nCC.\nThe waveform in Figure 4 shows how the output  latches \noff \nfollowing a short-circuit. The current in the MOSFET \nis 1.4A as the timer ramps up.10µF, especially if the wiring inductance from the supply \nto the V DD pin is greater than 3µH. The possibility of oscil-\nlation will  increase as the load current (during power-up) \nincreases. \nThere are two ways to prevent this type of \noscillation. The simplest way is to avoid load capacitances \nbelow 10µF. For wiring inductance larger than 20µH, the \nminimum load capacitance may extend to 100µF. A second \nchoice is to connect an external gate capacitor C P >1.5nF \nas shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Compensation for Small C LOAD4232 F03L TC4232\nOPTIONAL\nRC TO LOWERINRUSH CURRENTGATE\nCP\n2.2nF\nTurn-Off Sequence\nThe switch can be turned off by a variety of conditions. A \nnormal turn-off is initiated by the UV pin going below its \n1.235V threshold. Additionally, several fault conditions \nwill turn off the switch. These include an input overvolt -\nage (OV pin ), overcurrent circuit breaker (SENSE pin) or \novertemperature. \nNormally the switch is turned off with \na 250µA current pulling down the GATE pin to ground. \nWith the switch turned off, the OUT voltage drops which pulls the FB pin below its threshold. PG then pulls low to \nindicate output power is no longer good.\nIf V\nDD drops below 2.65V for greater than 5µs or INTV CC \ndrops below 2.5V for greater than 1µs, a fast shutdown \nof the switch is initiated. The GATE is pulled down with a \n140mA current to the OUT pin.\nOvercurrent Fault\nThe LTC4232 features an adjustable current limit with \nfoldback that protects against short-circuits and excessive \nload current. To prevent excessive power dissipation in the \nswitch during active current limit, the available current is \nreduced as a function of the output voltage sensed by the \nFB pin. A graph in the Typical Performance Characteristics \ncurves shows the Current Limit  Threshold Foldback.\nLTC423211\n4232fc For more information www.linear .com/L TC4232applica Tions inForMaTion\nCurrent Limit Adjustment\nThe default value of the active current limit is 5.6A. The \ncurrent limit threshold can be adjusted lower by placing \na resistor between the I SET pin and ground. As shown in \nthe Functional Block Diagram the voltage at the I SET pin \n(via the clamp circuit) sets the CS amplifier’s built-in offset \nvoltage. This offset voltage directly determines the active \ncurrent limit value. With the I SET pin open, the voltage at \nthe I SET pin is determined by a positive temperature co-\nefficient reference . This voltage is set to 0.618V at room \ntemperature which corresponds to a 5.6A current limit at \nroom temperature.\nAn external resistor R SET placed between the I SET pin and \nground forms a resistive divider with the internal 20k R ISET \nsourcing resistor. The divider acts to lower the voltage at \nthe I SET pin and therefore lower the current limit threshold. \nThe overall current limit threshold precision is reduced to \n±12% when using a 20k resistor to halve the threshold.Using a switch (connected to ground) in series with R\nSET \nallows the active current limit to change only when the \nswitch is closed. This feature can be used to  program  a \nreduced \nrunning current while the maximum available \ncurrent limit is used at startup.\nMonitor MOSFET Temperature\nThe voltage at the I SET pin increases linearly with increas-\ning temperature . The temperature profile of the I SET pin is \nshown in the Typical Performance Characteristics section. \nUsing a comparator or ADC to measure the I SET voltage \nprovides an indicator of the MOSFET temperature.The I SET voltage follows the formula:\n  VISET=RSET\nRSET+RISET•T+273°C( ) •2.093 mV / °C[ ]\nThe MOSFET temperature is calculated using R ISET of 20k.\n  T=(RSET+20k) •VISET\nRSET•2.093 mV / °C[ ]−273°C\nWhen R SET is not present, T becomes:\n  T=VISET\n2.093 mV / °C[ ]−273°C\nThere is an overtemperature circuit in the LTC4232 that \nmonitors an internal voltage similar to the I SET pin voltage. \nWhen the die temperature exceeds 145°C the circuit turns \noff the MOSFET until the temperature drops to 125°C.\nMonitor MOSFET Current\nThe current in the MOSFET passes through an internal \n7.5mΩ sense resistor. The voltage on the sense resistor is \nconverted to a current that is sourced out of the I MON pin. \nThe gain of I SENSE  amplifier is 20µA/A referenced from the \nMOSFET current. This output current can be converted to \na voltage using an external resistor to drive a comparator \nor ADC. The voltage compliance for the I MON pin is from \n0V to INTV CC – 0.7V.\nA microcontroller with a built-in comparator can build a \nsimple integrating single-slope ADC by resetting a capaci -\ntor that is charged with this current. When the capacitor \nvoltage \ntrips the comparator and the capacitor is reset, a \ntimer is started. The time between resets will indicate the \nMOSFET current.\nMonitor OV and UV Faults\nProtecting the load from an overvoltage condition is the \nmain function of the OV pin. In Figure 1 an external resis -\ntive divider (driving the  OV pin) connects to a comparator \nto \nturn off the MOSFET when the V DD voltage exceeds \n15.2V. If the V DD pin subsequently falls back below 14.9V, \nthe switch will be allowed to turn on immediately. In the \nLTC4232 the OV pin threshold is 1.235V when rising, and \n1.215V when falling out of overvoltage.Figure 4. Short-Circuit Waveform\n∆VGATE\n10V/DIVIOUT\n2A/DIVVOUT\n10V/DIV\nTIMER\n2V/DIV\n1ms/DIV4232 F04\nLTC423212\n4232fc For more information www.linear .com/L TC4232applica Tions inForMaTion\nThe UV pin functions as an undervoltage protection pin \nor as an “ON” pin. In the Figure 1 application the MOSFET \nturns off when V DD falls below 9.23V. If the V DD pin sub-\nsequently rises  above 9.88V for 100ms, the switch will \nbe allowed to turn on again. The LTC4232 UV turn-on/off \nthresholds are 1.235V (rising) and 1.155V (falling).\nIn the cases  of an undervoltage  or overvoltage the MOSFET  \nturns off and there is indication on the PG status pin. When \nthe overvoltage is removed the MOSFET’s gate ramps up \nimmediately at the rate determined by the INRUSH block.\nPower Good IndicationIn addition to setting the foldback current limit threshold, \nthe FB pin is used to determine a power good condition. \nThe Figure 1 application uses an external resistive divider \non the OUT pin to drive the FB pin. The PG comparator \nindicates logic high when OUT pin rises above 10.5V. If the \nOUT pin subsequently falls below 10.3V the comparator \ntoggles low. On the LTC4232 the PG comparator drives \nhigh when the FB pin rises above 1.235V and low when \nit falls below 1.215V.\nOnce the PG comparator is high the GATE pin voltage is  \nmonitored \nwith respect to the OUT pin. Once the GATE \nminus OUT voltage exceeds 4.2V the PG pin goes high. \nThis indicates to the system that it is safe to load the OUT \npin while the MOSFET is completely turned “on”. The PG \npin goes low when the GATE is commanded off (using \nthe UV, OV or SENSE pins) or when the PG comparator \ndrives low.\nDesign Example\nConsider the following design example (Figure 5): V IN = \n12V, I MAX = 5A. I INRUSH  = 100mA, C L = 330µF, V UVON = \n9.88V, V OVOFF  = 15.2V, V PGTHRESHOLD  = 10.5V. A current \nlimit fault triggers an automatic restart of the power-up \nsequence.The inrush current is defined by the current required to \ncharge the output capacitor using the fixed 0.3V/ms GATE \ncharge-up rate. The inrush current is defined as:\n IINRUSH  = CL • 0.3[V/ms] = 330µF • 0.3[V/ms] = 100mAAs mentioned previously the charge-up time is the out-\nput voltage  (12 V) divided by the output rate of 0.3V/ms \nresulting in 40ms. The peak power dissipation of 12V at \n100mA (or 1.2W) is within the SOA of the pass MOSFET \nfor 40ms (see MOSFET SOA curve in the Typical Perfor -\nmance Characteristics section).\nNext \nthe power dissipated in the MOSFET during overcur-\nrent must  be limited. The active current limit uses a timer \nto \nprevent excessive energy dissipation in the MOSFET. \nThe worst-case power dissipation occurs when the voltage  \nversus current profile of the foldback current limit is at the \nmaximum. This occurs when the current is 6.1A and the \nvoltage is one half of the V IN or 6V. See the Current Limit \nThreshold Foldback in the Typical Performance Charac-\nteristics section  to view this profile. In order to survive \n36W, the MOSFET SOA dictates a maximum time of 10ms \n(see SOA graph). Use the internal 2ms timer invoked by \ntying the TIMER pin to INTV CC. After the 2ms timeout the \nF LT pin needs to pull-down on the UV pin to restart the \npower-up sequence.\nThe values for overvoltage, undervoltage and power good \nthresholds using the resistive dividers on the UV, OV and \nFB pins match the requirements of turn-on at 9.88V and \nturn-off at 15.2V.The final schematic in Figure 5 results in very few external \ncomponents. The pull-up resistor, R7, connects to the PG \npin while the 20k (R\nMON) converts the I MON current to a \nvoltage at a ratio:\n VIMON = 20[µA/A] • 20k • I OUT = 0.4[V/A] • I OUT\nIn addition there is a 1µF bypass ( C1) on the INTV CC pin.Figure 5. 5A, 12V Card Resident ApplicationADCR1\n226k\nC11µFR220k12V\nR3140k\nR4\n20k\nRMON\n20k 4232 F05CL\n330µF\nUV = 9.88VOV = 15.2VPG = 10.5VVDD\nUVOUT\nFB\nPGGATE\nGNDIMONISETL TC4232\nOV\nINTV CCTIMERF LT+VOUT\n12V\n5A\nR710kR620kR5\n150k Z1*\n*TVS Z1: DIODES INC.

The minimum trace \nwidth for 1oz copper foil is 0.02" per amp to make sure \nthe trace stays at a reasonable temperature. Using 0.03" \nper amp or wider is recommended. Note that 1oz copper \nexhibits a sheet resistance of about 0.5mΩ/square. Small \nresistances add up quickly in high current applications.\nThere are two V DD pins on opposite sides of the package \nthat connect to the sense resistor and MOSFET. The PCB \nlayout should be balanced and symmetrical to each V DD \npin to balance current in the MOSFET bond wires. Figure 6  \nshows a recommended layout for the LTC4232.Although  \nthe MOSFET is self protected from overtem-\nperature, it  is recommended to solder the backside of the \npackage \nto a copper trace to provide a good heat sink. Note \nthat the backside is connected to the SENSE pin and can -\nnot be soldered to the ground plane. During normal loads \nthe \npower dissipated in the MOSFET is as high as 1.9W.  \nA 10mm × 10mm area of 1oz copper should be sufficient. \nThis area of copper can be divided in many layers.It \nis also important to put C1, the bypass capacitor for \nthe INTV CC pin as close as possible between the INTV CC \nand GND.4232 F06HEAT SINK\nVIA TO \nSINK\nGNDCOUT VDD\nFigure 6.
