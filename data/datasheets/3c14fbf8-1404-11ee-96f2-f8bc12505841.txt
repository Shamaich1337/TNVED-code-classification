The input signal can \nbe a sine wave or any logic level (≤2V P-P). There are four \nmembers of the family that differ in their output logic \nsignal type as follows:\n LTC6957-1: L\nVPECL Logic Outputs\n LTC6957-2: L\nVDS Logic Outputs\n LTC6957-3: CMOS Logic, In-Phase Outputs\n LTC6957-4: CMOS Logic, Complementar\ny Outputs\nThe LTC6957 will buffer and distribute any logic signal \nwith minimal additive noise, however , the part really \nexcels at translating sine wave signals to logic levels. The \nearly amplifier stages have selectable lowpass filtering \nto minimize the noise while still amplifying the signal to \nincrease its slew rate. This input stage filtering/noise limit -\ning is especially helpful in delivering the lowest possible phase noise signal with slow slewing input signals such as a typical 10MHz sine wave system reference.\nAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: Input pins IN\n+, IN–, FIL TA, FIL TB, SD1 and SD2 are protected by \nsteering diodes to either supply. If the inputs go beyond either supply rail, \nthe input current should be limited to less than 10mA. If pushing current into FIL TB, the Pin 6 voltage must be limited to 4V. On the logic pins (FIL TA, FIL TB, SD1 and SD2) the Absolute Maximum input current applies only at the maximum operating supply voltage of 3.45V; 10mA of input current with the absolute maximum supply voltage of 3.6V may create permanent damage from voltage stress.\nNote 3: With 3.6V Absolute Maximum supply voltage, the LTC6957-3/ \nLTC6957-4 CMOS outputs can sink 30mA while low, and source 30mA while high without damage. However , if overdriven or subject to an inductive load kick outside the supply rails, 30mA can create damaging voltage stress and is not guaranteed unless V\nDD is limited to 3.15V.ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nThe l denotes the specifications which apply over the full operating temperature range, otherwise specifications are at T A = 25°C. \nV+ = V DD = 3.3V, SD1 = SD2 = 0.4V, FIL TA = FIL TB = 0.4V, R LOAD = 480Ω to V DD/2, unless otherwise specified.

Properly \napplied, they can preserve phase noise performance in \nsituations where alternative solutions would degrade the \nphase noise significantly. They are also useful as logic \nconverters.\nHowever , no buffer device is capable of removing or \nreducing phase noise present on an input signal. As with \nmost low phase noise circuits, improper application of \nthe LTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/LTC6957-3/LTC6957-4 can \nresult in an increase in the phase noise through a variety \nof mechanisms. The information below will, hopefully, \nallow a designer to avoid such an outcome.\nThe LTC6957 is designed to be used with high perfor -\nmance clock signals destined for driving the encode \ninputs of ADCs or mixer inputs. Such clocks should not \nbe treated as digital signals. The beauty of digital logic is that there is noise margin both in the voltage and the tim -\ning, before any deleterious effects are noticed. In contrast, \nhigh performance clock signals have no margin for error in the timing before the system performance is degraded. \nUsers are encouraged to keep this distinction in mind \nwhile designing the entire clocking signal chain before, during, and after the LTC6957.\nInput Interfacing\nThe input stage is the same for all versions of the LTC6957  \nand is designed for low noise and ease of interfacing to \nsine-wave and small amplitude signals. Other logic types can interface directly, or with little effort since they pres -\nent a smaller challenge for noise preservation.\nFigure 1 shows a simplified schematic of the LTC6957  \ninput stage. The diodes are all for protection, both during \nESD events and to protect the low noise NPN devices from \nbeing damaged by input overdrive.\nThe resistors are to bias the input stage at an optimal \nDC level, but they are too large to leave floating without \nincreasing the noise. Therefore, for low noise use, always \nconnect both inputs to a low AC impedance. A capacitor to \nground/return is imperative on the unused input in single-\nended applications.\nFigure 16957 F01FIL TA\nFIL TB\nIN+\nIN–V+\nGND1.8k\n3.2k2mA1.2k\n1.2k1\n6\n3\n42\nFIL TERS\n5\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-420\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 2Figure 3. Single-Ended 50Ω Input SourceFigure 2a shows how to interface single-ended LVPECL \nlogic to the LTC6957, while Figure 2b shows how to drive \nthe LTC6957 with differential LVPECL signals. The capaci -\ntors shown are 10nF and can be inexpensive ceramics, \npreferably in small SMT cases. For use above 100MHz, \nlower value capacitors may be desired to avoid series \nresonance, which could increase the noise in Figure 2a \neven though the capacitor is just on the DC input. This \ncomment applies to all capacitors hooked to the inputs throughout this data sheet.\nIn Figure 2a, the R\nTERM implementation is up to the user \nand is to terminate the transmission line. If it is connected \nto a V TT that is passively generated and heavily bypassed \nto ground, the 10nF to ground shown on the inverting \nLTC6957 input is the appropriate connection to use. \nHowever , if the termination goes to an actively generated \nVTT voltage, lower noise may be achieved by connecting \nthe capacitor on the inverting input to that V TT rather than \nground.\n6957 F02b6957 F02a 10nFRTERM\n–+\nL TC6957\nFigure 2a.

In Figure 2b, the \nRTERMs are shown in a "Y" configuration that creates a pas-  \nsive V TT at the common point. Most 3.3V LVPECL devices \nhave differential outputs and can be terminated with three \n50Ω resistors as shown.\nFigure 3 shows a 50Ω RF signal source interface to the \nLTC6957. For a pure tone (sine wave) input, Figure 3 can handle up to 10dBm maximum. A broadband 50Ω match \nas shown should suffice for most applications, though \nfor small amplitude input signals a narrow band reactive matching network may offer incremental improvements in performance.\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-421\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1Figure 4Figure 4 shows the interface between current mode logic \n(CML) signals and the LTC6957 inputs. The specifics of \nterminating will be dependent on the particular CML driver \nused; Figure\xa04 shows terminations only at the load end of the line, but the same LTC6957 interface is appropri -\nate for applications with the source end of the line also terminated. In Figure 4a\n, a differential signal interface to \nthe LTC6957 is shown, which must be AC-coupled due to \nthe DC input levels required at the LTC6957.\n6957 F04aRTERM RTERM\n–+\nL TC6957 10nF10nF\n6957 F04bRTERM\n–+\nL TC6957\nFigure 4b. Single-Ended CML InputFigure 4a. Differential CML Input\n10nF10nFAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 4b shows a single-ended CML signal driving the \nLTC6957. This is not commonly used because of noise \nand immunity weaknesses compared to the differen -\ntial CML case. Because the signal is created by a cur -\nrent pulled through the termination resistor , the signal \nis inherently referenced to the supply voltage to which \nRTERM is tied. For that reason, the other LTC6957 should \nbe AC-referenced to that supply voltage as shown.\nThe polarity change shown here is for graphic clarity only, \nand can be reversed by swapping the LTC6957 input \nterminals.\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-422\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 5 shows the LTC6957  being driven by an LVDS  \n(EIA-644-A) signal pair . This is simply a matter of differ -\nentially terminating the pair and AC-coupling as shown \ninto the LTC6957 whose DC common mode voltage is \nincompatible with the LVDS standard.CMOS on the other hand cannot drive 50Ω loads, is usu -\nally routed single-ended, and by its nature is coupled to \nthe potentially noisy supply voltage half the time.\nThe LTC6957-3/LTC6957\n-4 provide CMOS outputs, so it \nmay seem surprising to read herein that CMOS is a poor \nchoice for low phase noise applications. However , these devices should prove useful for designers that recognize the challenges and limitations of using CMOS signals for low phase noise applications. See the CMOS Outputs of \nthe LTC6957-3/LTC6957-4 section for further information.\nThe best method for driving the LTC6957 with CMOS sig -\nnals would be to provide differential drive, but if that is not \navailable, there are few ways to create a differential CMOS \nsignal without running the risk of corrupting the skew or creating other problems. Therefore, single-ended CMOS signals are the norm and care must be taken when using this to drive the LTC6957.\nThe primary concern is that all routing should be termi -\nnated to minimize reflections. With CMOS logic there is \nusually plenty of signal (more than the LTC6957 can han-\ndle without attenuation) and the amplitude of the LTC6957  \ninput signal will generally be of secondary importance \ncompared to avoiding the deleterious effects of signal \nreflections. The primary concern about terminations is \nthat the input waveform presented to the LTC6957 should \nhave full speed slewing at the all important transitions. \nIf a rising edge is slowed by the destructive addition of the ringing/settling of a prior edge reflection, or even the \nstart of the current edge, the phase noise performance will \nsuffer . This is true for all logic types, but is particularly problematic when using CMOS because of the fast slew rates and because it does not naturally lend itself to clean terminations.\nPoint-to-point routing is best, and care should be taken \nto avoid daisy-chain routing, because the terminated \nend may be the only point along the line that sees clean \ntransitions. Earlier loads may even see a dwell in the \ntransition region which will greatly degrade phase noise \nperformance.Figure 5. LVDS Input6957 F05110Ω\n–+\nL TC6957 10nF10nF\nThe choice of 110Ω versus 100Ω termination is arbitrary \n(the EIA-644-A standard allows 90Ω  to 132Ω ) and should \nbe made to match the differential impedance of the trace \npair . The termination and AC-coupling elements should be \nlocated as close as possible to the LTC6957.\nIf DC-coupling is desired, for example to control the \nLTC6957 output phasing during times the LVDS input \nclocks will be halted, a pair of 3k resistors can parallel \nthe two capacitors in Figure 5. An EIA/TIA-644-A compli -\nant driver can drive this load, which is less load stress than specification 4.1.1. The differential voltage into the \nLTC6957  when clocked (> 100kHz ) will be full LVDS levels. \nWhen the clocks stop, the DC differential voltage created \nby the resistors and the 1.2k internal resistors (Figure \n1) will be 100mV, still sufficient to assure the desired \nLTC6957 output polarity. Choosing the smallest capaci -\ntors needed for phase noise performance will minimize the settling transients when the clocks restart.\nInterfacing with CMOS Logic\nThe logic families discussed and illustrated to this point \nare generally a better choice for routing and distributing \nlow phase-noise reference/clock signals than is CMOS \nlogic. All of the logic types shown so far are well suited \nfor use with low impedance terminations. Most of the time \nthere is a differential signal when using LV PECL or CML, \nand LVDS always has a differential signal. Differential \nsignals provide lots of margin for error when it comes \nto picking up noise and interference that can corrupt a \nreference clock.\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-423\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1Figure 6. CMOS InputFigure 6 shows a suggested CMOS to LTC6957 interface. \nThe transmission line shown is the PCB trace and the \ncomponent values are for a characteristic impedance of \n50Ω, though they could be scaled up or down for other values of Z0. The R1/R2 divider at the CMOS output cuts \nthe Thevenin voltage in half when the Z OUT of the driver is \nincluded. More importantly, it drives the transmission line \nwith a Thevenin driving resistance of 50Ω, matching the Z0 of the line. On the other end of the line, a 50Ω load is \npresented, minimizing reflections. This results in a second \n2:1 attenuation in voltage, so the LTC6957 input will be \napproximately 800mV P-P with 3V CMOS; 1.25V P-P with 5V  \nand 600mV P-P with 2.5V. All of these levels are less than \nthe maximum input swing of 2V P-P yet with clean edges \nand fast slew rates should be able to realize the full phase noise performance of the LTC6957.phase noise spectrum related to the other signals pro-\ncessed in the driver .\nInput Resistors\nThe LTC6957 input resistors, seen in Figure 1, are present \nat all times, including during shutdown. Although they \nconstitute a large portion of the shutdown current, this \nbehavior prevents the shutdown and wake-up cycling of \nthe LTC6957 from “ kicking back”  into prior stages, which \ncould create large transients that could take a while to \nsettle. Particularly in the common case of AC-coupling \nwhere the coupling cap charge is preserved.\nInput Filtering\nThe LTC6957 includes input filtering with three narrow-\nband settings in addition to the full bandwidth limitation of the cir cuit design.\nTable 1\nFIL TA FIL TB BANDWIDTH\nLow Low 1200MHz (Full Bandwidth)\nHigh Low 500MHz (–3dB)\nLow High 160MHz (–3dB)\nHigh High 50MHz (–3dB)\nFor slow slewing signals (i.e., <100MHz sine wave sig -\nnals) substantially lower phase noise can be achieved by using this feature. Bandwidth limiting is useful because it \nlimits the impact of all of the spectral energy that will alias \ndown to (on top of) the fundamental frequency.\nThe best filter setting to use for a given application will \ndepend on the clock frequency, amplitude, and waveform \nshape, with the single biggest determinant being the slew \nrate at the input of the LTC6957. Any amplifier noise will \nadd phase noise inversely proportional to its input slew rate, just from the dV/dt changing voltage noise to time base noise. But a fast slew rate may not be possible with other design constraints, such as the use of sine waves for EMI/RFI reasons, signal losses, etc. A limiting ampli -\nfier such as the LTC6957 should have enough bandwidth to preserve the slew rate of the input. But any additional \nbandwidth will provide no improvement in phase noise \ndue to slew rate preservation, while incurring a phase \nnoise penalty from noise aliasing.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n6957 F06–+\nL TC6957R1\n75ΩCMOS\nROUT ≈ 25/uni03A9R2\n100Ω50ΩZ0 = 50Ω\nThe various capacitors are for AC-coupling and should \nhave Z << 50Ω at the operating frequency. The capacitors \nallow the LTC6957 to set its own DC input bias level, and \nreduce the DC current drain, which at 12.4mA (for the \ncase of a driver powered from 3.3V) is significant. This \ncurrent drain can be reduced (with some potential for a \nnoise penalty) by increasing the attenuation at the R1/\nR2 network, taking care to keep the Thevenin impedance equal to the Z0 of the trace.\nWhen using CMOS logic, it is important to consider how \nall of the output drivers, in the same IC, are being used. For best performance, the entire IC should be devoted to driving the LTC6957, or if other gates in the same pack -\nage must be put to use, they should only carry the same timing signal (such as for fan-out) or be multiplexed in time so that only one timing signal is being processed at a time, such as for multiplexing selective shutdowns of different segments of a system.

So if a design will have an octave \nor two range of amplitudes or frequencies, it is sufficient \nto choose the filter setting whose range most closely \nmatches the application\'s range when using Tables 2 or \n3 and the noise penalty will not be severe anywhere in \nthe range.\nEvidently, the input filtering will not significantly help with \nlarge and fast slewing input signals to the LTC6957. As \nseen in Figure 1, the input has a differential pair before the \nfilters, so the limiting will already have happened before \nthe filter . Fortunately, with large input signals, perfor -\nmance is typically better than with smaller input signals because phase noise is a signal-to-noise phenomenon.\nInput Drive and Output Skew\nAll versions of the LTC6957 have very good output skew; \nthe specification limits consist almost entirely of test mar -\ngins. Even laboratory verification of the skew between dif -\nferent outputs is a challenging exercise, given the need to \nmeasure within ±1ps. With electromagnetic propagation \nvelocity in FR-4 being well known as 6" per nanosecond, the skew of the LTC6957 will be impacted by PCB trace routing length differences of just 6mils.\nThe LTC6957 t PD and t SKEW  are specified for a 100mV  \nstep with 50mV of overdrive. This is common for high \nspeed comparators, though it may not reflect the typi -\ncal application usage of parts such as the LTC6957. The \npropagation delay of the LTC6957 will increase with less \noverdrive and decrease with more overdrive, as would \nthat of a high speed comparator . To a lesser extent, hav -\ning the same overdrive but a larger signal (for instance a differential input step of –200mV \n to 50mV) will increase \npropagation delay, though this effect is smaller and can usually be ignored.\nA consequence of this behavior may be a perceived mis -\nmatch between the propagation delay for rising versus \nfalling edges when driven with an AC-coupled input whose duty cycle is not exactly 50%. The LTC6957 inputs are \ninternally DC-coupled, and as shown in Figure 1, biasing \nis provided at ~64% of the supply voltage. AC-coupled \ninput signals with a duty cycle of exactly 50% will see \nsymmetric levels of overdrive for the two signal direc -\ntions. If, for example, the input signal is a 100mV P-P \nsquare wave with a duty-cycle of 48%, meaning it is high 48% of the time and low 52% of the time, the DC average will be 48mV above the low voltage level. This means the rising edge has 52mV of overdrive, and the falling edge has 48mV of overdrive.\nAs a result of this, the rising edge t PD will be faster than the \nfalling edge t PD. Fortunately, this will make the output duty \ncycle closer to 50% than the input duty cycle. Figure 8  \nis from measurements on the LTC6957-2, with a 2V to 2.1V square wave on IN\n–, and with IN+ set to various DC \nvoltages between those two levels. The X-axis is the over -\ndrive level for the t PD+ data, and is 100mV minus the over -\ndrive level for the t PD– data, to illustrate the level of t PD \nchanges that can unexpectedly occur with AC-coupling. \nThe lines are dashed where the measurement uncertainty \nbecomes large, when single digit millivolts and picosec -\nonds are being measured1. As can be seen, the t PD+/tPD– \nmismatch is very good at 50mV where the two overdrive levels are the same.\n1 Below 2mV to 3mV, the input offset and the small input hysteresis play a role too. Fortunately, \nneither is large enough to be a concern in normal operation.\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-426\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1The simplest way to terminate and bias the LTC6957-1 \noutputs is to route the differential output to the differential \nreceiver and terminate the lines at that point with the three \nresistor network shown in Figure 9. The differential ter -\nmination will be 100Ω , while the common mode termina -\ntion will be 75Ω which could result in additional common  \nmode susceptibility. A bypass capacitor on the midpoint \nof the Y can be used to improve this.\nIf the common mode termination impedance is not an \nissue, the three resistor Y configuration can be changed to a three resistor delta configuration, which is a simpler layout in most cases.\nDuring transitions to and from shutdown, the LTC6957-1 \noutputs are not guaranteed to comply with the specified output levels for any length of time after the rising edge of SD1/SD2, nor for any time before sufficient t\nWAKEUP /\ntENABLE  subsequent to the falling edge of SD1/SD2. The \noutput common mode and differential voltage could have \na slow settling time compared to the signal frequency, and \na long string of runt pulses could be seen. The LTC6957-1  \nshutdown capability should be used as a slow on/off con-\ntrol, not a logic gating/enable control.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 9.

These are independent of input \noverdrive, but can change with supply voltage and tem-perature, and can vary part to part. The complementary outputs of the LTC6957\n-4 will therefore be higher skew \nthan the like edges of the LTC6957-3. Both the LTC6957-3 \nand LTC6957-4 will have large (120ps typ) t PD+ to t PD– \ndiscrepancies compared to LVPECL or LVDS outputs.\nLVPECL Outputs of the LTC6957-1\nFigure 9 shows a simplified schematic of the LTC6957-1 \nLVPECL output stage. As with most ECL outputs, there are \nno internal pull-down devices so the user must provide \nboth termination and biasing external to the device. Note that only the current source is cut off during shutdown. The bases of the output NPNs are still tied to the pull-up \nresistors, so both outputs will be pulled high in shutdown, \nand it is the user’s responsibility to disconnect the exter -\nnal loading if power reduction is to be realized.\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-427\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1Power Supplies for LVPECL Operation\nThe LTC6957-1 can operate from 3.15V to 3.45V total \nsupply voltage difference, irrespective of the absolute \nlevel of those voltages. The convention in LVPECL is that \nthe negative supply is ground, while in ECL the positive supply may be ground or 2.0V. The LTC6957-1 can work in all of these situations provided the total supply voltage difference is within the 3.15V to 3.45V range. No special supply sequencing will be needed. With a 2V rail the out -\nput terminations go to ground, while, with the positive \nsupply grounded, the outputs can tolerate short circuits \nto ground. However , the four CMOS logic input signals \nwill need to be driven with respect to whatever absolute levels of supply voltages are used. If FIL TA, FIL TB, SD1, and SD2 are fixed, they can be tied to the appropriate rail and this is not a problem. Interface logic levels could get tricky if they need to be programmed in-system.\nIn any voltage configuration, be aware that the LVPECL \noutput stage depends on the external load to complete its \nbiasing and, as such, is susceptible to phase modulation \nas the supply voltage changes. The LTC6957-1 is gener -\nally less sensitive to variations in the supply voltage if the termination voltage tracks the supply rather than ground.With all four outputs terminated or otherwise driving heavy loads, the LTC6957-1 power consumption and \ntemperature rise may be an issue.\nFortunately, the data sheet specification for supply cur -\nrent with output loads does not need to be multiplied \nby the entire supply voltage to calculate on-chip power \ndissipation because most of that current flows through the loads which will dissipate a significant portion of the total system power .\nTypically, the internal power consumption will be (20mA • \n3.3V =  ) 66mW, while the on-chip power dissipation from \nthe output loading will be less than half that number . With \na total power dissipation on-chip of 90mW, the tempera -\nture rise in the MS-12 package will be 13°C  given the \nθJA of that package. For use to 125°C ambient (H-grade) \ndesigners should be sure to check the temperature rise using their specific output loading and supply levels. The \nAbsolute Maximum rating for Junction Temperature is \n150°C , and must be avoided to prevent damaging the \ndevice, and as stated in Note 1: "Exposure to any Absolute \nMaximum Rating condition for extended periods of time may affect device reliability and lifetime."APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-428\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1LVDS Outputs of the LTC6957-2\nFigure 10 shows a simplified schematic of the LTC6957-2 \nLVDS output stage.

To slow the edge rates, add \ndifferential capacitance across the outputs. 2.7pF is sufficient to meet the standard.\nThe TIA/EIA-644-A standard does not cover driver charac -\nteristics during shutdown nor the transitions to and from \nshutdown. The LTC6957-2 outputs are not guaranteed to comply with the standard for any length of time after the rising edge of SD1/ SD2, nor for any time before sufficient \ntWAKEUP /tENABLE subsequent to the falling edge of SD1/\nSD2. The output common mode voltage (V OS in 644- A \nparlance) could have a slow settling time compared to the \nsignal frequency, and a long string of runt pulses could be seen. The LTC6957-2 shutdown capability should be used as a slow, power-saving on/off control, not a logic gating/enable control.\nPower Supplies for LVDS Operation\nThe LTC6957-2 has a single supply that should be within \nthe 3.15V to 3.45V range.\nThe LTC6957-2 power supply voltage can corrupt the spectral purity of the clock signal, though to a lesser \ndegree than with any of the other options. See the Typical Performance Characteristic chart t\nPD vs Supply Voltage.\nWhen using both LVDS channels, the LTC6957-2 power \nconsumption can exceed 120mW, which results in a \njunction-to-ambient rise of 17.4°C  in the MS-12 package, \nmore when operated at 3.45V. Again, it is up to the user \nto always avoid junction temperatures above the Absolute \nMaximum rating, and to stay comfortably below it for any \nextended periods of time.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 10.

The LTC6957-3 outputs \nare driven synchronously in-phase, while the LTC6957-4 outputs are driven differentially out-of-phase.\nAlthough the LTC6957-3/LTC6957-4 are specified for a \nresistive load, the outputs can drive capacitive loads as well. With more than a few picoFarads of load, the rise and fall times will be degraded in direct proportion to the load capacitance.\nDuring shutdown, the LTC6957-3 outputs will both be \nset to a logic low.  \nDuring shutdown, the LTC6957-4 OUT1 will be set to a \nlogic low, while OUT2 will be set to a logic high.\nDuring transitions to and from shutdown, the LTC6967-3/  \nLTC6957-4 outputs may not comply with the specified \noutput levels for any length of time after the rising edge of SD1/SD2, nor for any time before sufficient t\nWAKEUP /\ntENABLE  subsequent to the falling edge of SD1/SD2. The APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\noutputs may have one or two errant transitions resulting \nin runt pulses being seen. The LTC6957-3/LTC6957-4 \nshutdown capability should be used as a slow, power-\nsaving on/off control, not a logic gating/enable control, \nand because they can not be put in a high impedance \n(3-state) condition, the shutdown functionality is not \nusable as a way to multiplex multiple outputs or devices.\nPower Supplies for CMOS Operation\nThe LTC6957-3/LTC6957 -4 operate with V+ from 3.15V  to \n3.45V only. If the LTC6957-3/LTC6957-4 are used to drive \nCMOS logic at a lower voltage rail, the output stage can \nbe powered (Pin 11) by a lower voltage, down to 2.4V MIN. \nNote that significant degradation of the spectral purity \ncould occur if the output supply, V DD, is not clean, either \nbecause of additional broadband noise or discrete spec -\ntral tones. The nature of a CMOS logic gate forms an AM \nmodulator of low frequency disturbances on the power/ground that modulate the signal propagating through the CMOS gate. Numerous common phenomena can ser\nve \nto convert the AM to PM/FM and, even if the conversion efficiency is low, corrupt the phase noise to unacceptable levels in demanding applications.\nIf two separate supplies are used, the only supply sequenc -\ning issue to be aware of is that if the V DD comes up first, \nthe OUT1/OUT2 CMOS outputs will be high impedance \nuntil V+ > ~1V. Note that the four CMOS control inputs are \nall referenced to V+, not the output supply. Also note that \nduring operation the output supply should be equal to or \nless than V+. The LTC6957-3/LTC6957-4 will function with \nVDD several hundred millivolts above the V+ supply, but \ndepending on the load, this margin for error can largely be consumed by transient load steps.\nWhen driving capacitive loads at high frequencies, the \nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-4 V DD power consumption can jump \nconsiderably over the quiescent power taken from V+. The \nDynamic current specification is with no load and adds directly to the current needed to repetitively charge and discharge a capacitive load.\nWith 24mA drawn from V+ at 3.3V, and another 20mA  \nto 30mA drawn from V DD (easy to do with two outputs \nactive at 300MHz), the total power consumption can be \n145mW to 178mW, resulting in a junction-to-ambient rise Figure 11.

The Absolute Maximum \nrating for Junction Temperature is 150°C, which must be \navoided to prevent damaging the device, and as stated \nin Note 1:  "Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating \ncondition for extended periods of time may affect device \nreliability and lifetime."\nLow Phase Noise Design Considerations\nPhase noise is a frequency domain representation of the \nrandom variation in phase of a periodic signal. It is char -\nacterized as the power at a given offset frequency relative to the power of the fundamental frequency . Phase noise \nis specified in dBc/Hz, decibels relative to the carrier in a \n1Hz bandwidth. It is essentially a frequency dependent \nsignal-to-noise ratio.\nDesigning for low phase noise is challenging, even with a \nsolid understanding of phase noise. Any designer attempt -\ning such a task will find a good working understanding of \nwhat phase noise is, and how it behaves, to be the most important tool to achieve success. One of the most intui -\ntive explanations is found in Chapter 3, “The Relationship \nBetween Phase Jitter and Noise Density,” of W .P . Robins’ 1982 text, “Phase Noise in Signal Sources.”\nWith a solid base of understanding, the designer will now \nsee that the entire clocking chain is full of potential phase modulators. The noise of an amplifier is usually thought of as an additive term, but for phase noise the bias noise, \nto the extent that the amplifier bandwidth is dependent on \nthe bias level, is not an additive term but a modulating term. The LTC6957 is a monolithic clock limiting ampli -\nfier carefully designed so that users do not have to worry about such details.\nHowever , users of the \nLTC6957 still need to pay attention \nto external considerations that can result in corruption of \nthe good phase noise performance available from all the components used.\nTiming jitter is a term used to describe the integration \nof phase noise over a specified bandwidth which is pre-sented as a time domain specification.Unfortunately , the term \n“low jitter” has become so over -\nused that it is rendered virtually meaningless. High speed \ncommunication links doing de-serialization and the like \ncan require jitter on the order of 30ps  to 50ps . This is \nlower jitter than required for a clock on a micro-controller , \nbut for high frequency sampling, even 1ps can severely \nimpact the dynamic range achievable. Therefore, it is best \nto ignore the term “low jitter” and look for measured val -\nues of jitter , and preferably phase noise. To analyze and measure true low noise components, most instruments measure phase noise (in dBc/Hz) rather than jitter .\nA second consideration when designing for low phase \nnoise is that any clock signal is an analog signal and \nshould be thought of and routed as such. They should \nnot be run through large FPGAs with lots of activities at multiple frequencies, they should not be routed through PCB traces alongside digital data lines, and they should \nnot be routed through clock fan-out devices that have \nfeatures such as zero delay or programmable skew. The \nspecifics of the PCB traces and what surrounds them \nshould be analyzed as if the clock signals were among \nyour most sensitive analog signals, because in demanding \napplications that is what your clock signals are. Note that signal integrity software intended for analyzing crosstalk in digital systems may only give yes or no answers and that clocking performance can be compromised at levels \n40dB to 60dB below what is required to get that “yes” \nanswer .\nCommon pitfalls with clock signals are the same as for \nsensitive analog signals: routing near or alongside digital traces of any kind, crossing digital traces on an adjacent \nlayer within a sandwich of ground planes, using digital \npower planes as part of layer sandwiches, and assuming all of these are sufficiently mitigated by using differential clock signaling.\nThe way to address these issues is also the same as for \nsensitive analog signals: routing away from digital traces \nwherever possible;  routing with shielding of ground, \neither planes, adjacent traces, or both; making realistic \nassumptions of common mode rejections (30dB to 40dB \nat most); and keeping a critical eye out for unintended \ncouplers during the design and debug phases.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-431\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nEven if the world’ s cleanest reference clock were used \nto feed the LTC6957, simply routing it through a poorly \ndesigned system would result in compromised spectral \nperformance. This often catches designers by surprise \nbecause the mechanisms above are typically additive and \nlinear , which result in filtering and additional spectral com -\nponents, but don’t by themselves create phase modula -\ntion. Unfortunately, any limiter , including the LTC6957, \nwill, through its nonlinear action, transform additive terms \ninto phase modulation. When a small tone is added to a \nlarge pure tone, the larger tone will appear to have its \namplitude and phase modulated at a rate equal to the dif -\nference of the two frequencies. Pass this through a limiter \nand only the phase modulation remains.\nIn large complex systems, it may be impractical to elimi -\nnate all potential corrupting of the clock signals. In such \na case, a narrow band filter placed at the inputs of the \nLTC6957 can remove the unwanted spectral components \nthat are far enough away from the fundamental.Close-in spectral anomalies will likely be impervious to \nsuch filtering. Therefore, it is doubly important to keep an \neye out for modulating mechanisms. If the clock is routed \nthrough CMOS logic gates, the power supply used for that \ngate will AM modulate the signal at the very least. The \nmodulation could manifest itself as sideband tones if the \npower supply has repetitive disturbances, common with \nswitching power supplies, or it could manifest itself as \nrandom noise if the noise of a linear regulator is too high.\nAnother source of corruption in large systems or labora -\ntory measurements is the use of flexible cabling, which \ncan have a low level piezoelectric effect that modulates the  \nelectrical length in response to mechanical vibration. \nRigid or semi-rigid cabling and PCB routing can be used \nto eliminate this source of signal corruption.AM to PM Conversion at the LTC6957 Inputs\nThe LTC6957 input stage has some AM to PM conversion, \nbut as seen in the Typical Performance Characteristics \nsection, even at 300MHz this is less than 0.5°/dB. One \nsource of AM to PM conversion at the LTC6957 input is \nthe optional lowpass filtering, because the upper side -\nband and the lower sideband will be attenuated by slightly \ndifferent amounts. This difference is quite small for low offset frequencies, but the difference grows both as the frequency of the modulation increases, and as the carrier \nfrequency approaches the filter cutoff frequency where \nthe filter has a steeper roll-off.\nTherefore, if small amounts of AM are known to be present \nand an unacceptable level of PM is seen at the LTC6957 output, it may be helpful to change the input filter setting to a higher cutoff frequency.\nCross Talk from Loading at the LTC6957 Outputs\nAnother mechanism to be aware of in the LTC6957 is \ncross-modulation of the outputs. Except for the CMOS \nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-4, there is minimal direct AM or \nPM modulation of the outputs by the power supply. In \nthe CMOS case, the V DD power supply will directly AM \nmodulate the outputs, with a small amount of AM to PM \nconversion.\nThe thing to be aware of here is that there can be load-\ninduced disturbances internal to the LTC6957 that can \nmodulate the other output. For instance, hooking up one \noutput to an ADC encode input and the second output to \nthe FPGA that performs the first DSP on the ADC outputs, \ncan result in considerable kickback of FPGA generated \nsignals into the LTC6957. If this cross-modulates over to the other output, all kinds of deleterious effects may be seen including tones, images, etc.\nThe CMOS LTC6957-3/LTC6957-4 are more susceptible \nto this than the LVPECL and LVDS (LTC6957-1/LTC6957-2). To prevent this, a buffer can be placed between the LTC6957 and the FPGA, even one that compromises the \nfull jitter performance considerably. Because it is the ADC \nthat is doing the sampling— the FPGA clock input has \nenough margin for error to qualify as a digital signal.\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-432\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1Phase Noise Measurement\nAdditive (also called residual) phase noise can be par -\nticularly challenging to measure. Figure 12 shows a typi-\ncal laboratory set-up for testing the LTC6957-1 phase \nnoise. The LTC6957-1 has the lowest broadband phase \nnoise of the various dash numbers (equal to that of the \nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-4) and the lowest close-in noise \nwith a corner frequency below 2kHz, so it presents the most challenging case.\nThe various components and their role will be discussed \nas this will illustrate both the care that must be taken \nto realize the full performance of the LTC6957, and the \ndemanding nature of making phase noise measurements.\nThe signal starts with a 122.88MHz CW tone from the \nAgilent 8644 synthesizer at a fairly high power level of \n12.5dBm. T wo series LPFs at 150MHz cut out all the high \nfrequency noise components that would otherwise con-\ntribute noise because of the aliasing caused by the limiting \naction of the LTC6957. A signal splitter then separates the \nsignal in two; one path will propagate through the DUT \nand the other won’t, a common method used for measur -\ning residual phase noise.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIn theory, all the phase noise in the signal source will be rejected with the reading reflecting only the difference in \nnoise between the two paths. However , the rejection is \nnot perfect, particularly at very high offset frequencies \nwhere the phase difference between the two paths pro -\ngressively increases, thus the successive lowpass filters on the signal sour ce.\nThe Agilent 5505 measurement system uses the \nN5500A \nfront end, which includes a mixer to compare the signal \nand reference phases. For amplifier noise, it is appro -\npriate to feed the DUT path to the signal input, but for \nclock buffers that create fast clock edges, it is usually \nadvantageous to use the reference input, which seems to be sensitive only to the edges and not noise throughout the period. This is a reasonable thing to do because the \nLTC6957  is designed to drive ADC encode inputs or mixer \nports which have the same qualitative properties.\nBoth the signal and reference inputs to the test set need \nto be fairly large (15dBm to 20dBm) to realize the best \nnoise floor , so both signal paths include Mini-Circuits \nZHL-2010+ low noise amplifiers to boost the signal. The \nLTC6957 -1 was operated from 2V /–1.3V supplies so it Figure 12.

This coupler allows a spur input to be injected, \nwhile a second coupler allows the size of the spur , relative \nto the carrier , to be measured. More on that in a min -\nute. The three attenuators in this signal path work with the ZHL-2010+ to manage the dynamic range, while the \nattenuators on the coupling ports keep these terminals \nfrom degrading the measured noise.\nFinally, an ARRA L9428A line stretcher is used to adjust \nfor quadrature. One last attenuator helps with impedance \nmatching between the N5500A input and the line stretcher \noutput port. The E5505A can automatically adjust the sig -\nnal source phase/frequency for quadrature when mea -\nsuring VCOs or synthesizers, but for additive noise this \nadjustment is manual because the adjustment must be \nmade after the signal is split into the two paths. The line stretcher has a range of just 166ps, but with 122.88MHz, up to 20ns of adjustment may be needed (1/4 cycle). Not \nshown is the various short lengths of SMA cables and \nbarrel couplers that can also be added or subtracted to adjust the relative phase of the two signal paths.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nTo calibrate E5505/N5500 measurements, the gain of the mixer must be known. The surest way to measure it at the actual frequencies being used is to inject a calibration \ntone. For a 10kHz  offset, a 122.89MHz low level (– 10dBm) \nsignal is fed into the first coupler port. The requirements for this signal are not demanding, so a general purpose \nsynthesizer that can be frequency locked, such as the \nHP8657B, can be used.\nThe E5505 measures the amplitude of the resulting 10kHz  \nmixer output, but to put that in context (so that it can later \ncalculate results in dBc) it needs to know the size of the \ninjected spur relative to the carrier . Therefore, that relative \ndifference is measured using a spectrum analyzer con -\nnected to the attenuator on the second coupler .\nHopefully the above discussion conveys the meticulous \neffort needed to measure additive phase noise of a single \ndevice, at a single operating frequency. While the circuitry \nin Figure 12 can be used to measure the entire spectrum \nof phase noise (all offset frequencies) as well as the phase \nnoise at other clock frequencies, every clock frequency \nwill require manual adjusting for quadrature. The input \nLPFs will either need to be changed to match the new \nclock frequency, or possibly amplitudes at various places will have to be adjusted to account for the frequency roll-off therein.\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-434\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1Crystal Oscillator\n6957 TA02b–170–140–130\n–150\n–160–120–110–100–80–60–40\n–90–70–50\nOFFSET FREQUENCY (Hz)1 10 100 1k 10k 100k 1MMEASURED ON AGILENT E5052A\n10 CORRELATIONS\n1Hz –47.34dBc/Hz10Hz –82dBc/Hz100Hz –116.36dBc/Hz1kHz –148.03dBc/Hz10kHz –154.84dBc/Hz100kHz –157.58dBc/Hz1MHz –157.99dBc/HzPHASE NOISE (dBc/Hz)TYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nTotal Phase Noise of 10MHz Crystal Oscillator6957 TA02aFIL TA\nFIL TB\nIN+\nIN–SD1 V+V+5VIN+\n3.3V\nV+V+11\n101\n6\n3\n4\nSD2 GNDL TC6957-3L T1761-3.3V\nTO ALL V+ POINTS0.01µF\nOUTBP\nOUT TO 50/uni03A9\n0.3V P-P \nSQUARE WAVE VDD\nOUT1\nOUT2\nGNDOUT450/uni03A9\n100/uni03A9\n10MHz\nAT CUT2k\n75pF150Ω1µF\n30pF0.1µF\n50MHz\nBANDWIDTH\n9\n8\n7 512 210µF\n0.1µF\nLTC6957-1/LTC6957-2/\nLTC6957-3/LTC6957-435\n6957fb For more information www.linear .com/L TC6957-1PACKAGE DESCRIPTION\nPlease refer to http://www.linear .com/product/LTC6957-1#packaging for the most recent package drawings.\n3.00 ±0.10\n(4 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
