General description\nThe 74AUP2G07 is a dual buffer with open-drain outputs. Schmitt-trigger action at all inputs makes\nthe circuit tolerant of slower input rise and fall times. This device ensures very low static and\ndynamic power consumption across the entire V CC range from 0.8 V to 3.6 V. This device is fully\nspecified for partial power down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry disables the output,\npreventing the potentially damaging backflow current through the device when it is powered down.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range from 0.8 V to 3.6 V\n•CMOS low power dissipation\n•High noise immunity\n•Overvoltage tolerant inputs to 3.6 V\n•Low noise overshoot and undershoot < 10 % of V CC\n•IOFF circuitry provides partial Power-down mode operation\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78 Class II Level B\n•Low static-power consumption; I CC = 0.9 μA (maximum)\n•Complies with JEDEC standards:\n•JESD8-12 (0.8 V to 1.3 V)\n•JESD8-11 (0.9 V to 1.65 V)\n•JESD8-7 (1.65 V to 1.95 V)\n•JESD8-5 (2.3 V to 2.7 V)\n•JESD8C (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM JESD22-A114F Class 3A exceeds 5000 V\n•MM JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•CDM JESD22-C101E exceeds 1000 V\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\nNexperia 74AUP2G07\nLow-power dual buffer with open-drain output\n3.
