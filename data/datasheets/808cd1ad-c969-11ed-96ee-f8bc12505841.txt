The device is capable of supplying 250mA\nof output current with a dropout voltage of 400mV. De-signed for use in battery-powered or high voltage sys-\ntems, the low quiescent current (40 µA operating) makes\nthe LT3012B an ideal choice. Quiescent current is also well\ncontrolled in dropout.\nOther features of the LT3012B include the ability to oper-\nate with very small output capacitors. The regulators arestable with only 3.3 µF on the output while most older\ndevices require between 10 µF and 100 µF for stability.\nSmall ceramic capacitors can be used without any need forseries resistance (ESR) as is common with other regula-\ntors. Internal protection circuitry includes reverse-battery\nprotection, current limiting, thermal limiting and reversecurrent protection.\nThe device is available with an adjustable output with a\n1.24V reference voltage. The LT3012B regulator is avail-able in the 16-lead TSSOP and 12 pin low profile (0.75mm)\n(4mm × 3mm) DFN packages with an exposed pad for\nenhanced thermal handling capability. ■Low Current High Voltage Regulators\n■Regulator for Battery-Powered Systems\n■Telecom Applications\n■Automotive ApplicationsFEATURES DESCRIPTIOU\nAPPLICATIO  SU\nTYPICAL APPLICATIOU, LTC and LT are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation. \nAll other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\n1µFVIN\n5.4V TO\n80V\n3012B  TA01VOUT\n5V250mA\n3.3 µF750k\n249kIN\nLT3012BOUT\nADJ\nGND\nOUTPUT CURRENT (mA)0250300400\n350\n200\n3012B  TA02200\n150\n50 100 150 250100\n50\n0DROPOUT VOLTAGE (mV)\n2LT3012B\n3012bfPACKAGE/ORDER I  FOR   ATIOUU WIN Pin Voltage ...................................................  ±80V\nOUT Pin Voltage ...............................................  ±60V\nIN to OUT Differential Voltage ........................... ±80V\nADJ Pin Voltage .................................................. ±7V\nOutput Short-Circuit Duration .....................

Exposure to any Absolute\nMaximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device\nreliability and lifetime.\nNote 2:  The LT3012B is tested and specified for these conditions with the\nADJ pin connected to the OUT pin.Note 3:  Operating conditions are limited by maximum junction\ntemperature. The regulated output voltage specification will not apply for\nall possible combinations of input voltage and output current. Whenoperating at maximum input voltage, the output current range must be\nlimited. When operating at maximum output current, the input voltage\nrange must be limited.\nNote 4:  To satisfy requirements for minimum input voltage, the LT3012B\nis tested and specified for these conditions with an external resistor divider\n(249k bottom, 549k top) for an output voltage of 4V. The external resistor\ndivider will add a 5 µA DC load on the output.\nNote 5:  Dropout voltage is the minimum input to output voltage differential\nneeded to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In dropout, the\noutput voltage will be equal to (V\nIN – VDROPOUT ).Note 6:  GND pin current is tested with V IN = 4.5V and a current source\nload. This means the device is tested while operating close to its dropout\nregion. This is the worst-case GND pin current. The GND pin current will\ndecrease slightly at higher input voltages.\nNote 7:  ADJ pin bias current flows into the ADJ pin.\nNote 8:  Reverse output current is tested with the IN pin grounded and the\nOUT pin forced to the rated output voltage. This current flows into the OUT\npin and out the GND pin.\nNote 9:  The LT3012BE is guaranteed to meet performance specifications\nfrom 0 °C to 125 °C operating junction temperature. Specifications over\nthe –40 °C to 125 °C operating junction temperature range are assured by\ndesign, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls.\nNote 10:  This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended to\nprotect the device during momentary overload conditions. Junction\ntemperature will exceed 125 °C when overtemperature protection is\nactive.

The output supplies\npower to the load. A minimum output capacitor of 3.3 µF is\nrequired to prevent oscillations. Larger output capacitors\nwill be required for applications with large transient loadsto limit peak voltage transients. See the Applications\nInformation section for more information on output ca-\npacitance and reverse output characteristics.\nADJ (Pin 4)/(Pin 5):  Adjust. This is the input to the error\namplifier. This pin is internally clamped to ±7V. It has a\nbias current of 30nA which flows into the pin (see curve of\nADJ Pin Bias Current vs Temperature in the Typical Perfor-\nmance Characteristics). The ADJ pin voltage is 1.24V\nreferenced to ground, and the output voltage range is1.24V to 60V.\nGND (Pins 5, 13)/(Pins 1, 6, 8, 9, 16, 17):  Ground. The\nexposed backside of the package is an electrical connec-\ntion for GND. As such, to ensure optimum device opera-\ntion and thermal performance, the exposed pad must be\nconnected directly to pin 5/pin 6 on the PC board.IN (Pins 10, 11)/(Pins 13,14):  Input. Power is supplied to\nthe device through the IN pin. A bypass capacitor is\nrequired on this pin if the device is more than six inches\naway from the main input filter capacitor. In general, theoutput impedance of a battery rises with frequency, so it\nis advisable to include a bypass capacitor in battery-\npowered circuits. A bypass capacitor in the range of 1 µF to\n10 µF is sufficient. The LT3012B is designed to withstand\nreverse voltages on the IN pin with respect to ground andthe OUT pin. In the case of a reversed input, which canhappen if a battery is plugged in backwards, the LT3012B\nwill act as if there is a diode in series with its input. There\nwill be no reverse current flow into the LT3012B and noreverse voltage will appear at the load. The device will\nprotect both itself and the load.\nNC (Pins 1, 6-9, 12)/(Pins 2, 7, 10-12, 15):  No Connect.\nNo Connect pins may be floated, tied to IN or tied to GND.\nUU UPI   FU  CTIO  S (DFN Package)/(TSSOP Package)\n8LT3012B\n3012bfThe LT3012B is a 250mA high voltage low dropout regu-\nlator with micropower quiescent current. The device iscapable of supplying 250mA at a dropout voltage of\n400mV. Operating quiescent current is only 40 µA. In\naddition to the low quiescent current, the LT3012B incor-\nporates several protection features which make it ideal for\nuse in battery-powered systems. The device is protected\nagainst both reverse input and reverse output voltages. Inbattery backup applications where the output can be held\nup by a backup battery when the input is pulled to ground,\nthe LT3012B acts like it has a diode in series with its outputand prevents reverse current flow.\nAdjustable Operation\nThe LT3012B has an output voltage range of 1.24V to\n60V. The output voltage is set by the ratio of two external\nresistors as shown in Figure 1. The device servos the\noutput to maintain the voltage at the adjust pin at 1.24Vreferenced to ground. The current in R1 is then equal to\n1.24V/R1 and the current in R2 is the current in R1 plus\nthe ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ pin bias current, 30nAat 25 °C, flows through R2 into the ADJ pin. The output\nvoltage can be calculated using the formula in Figure 1.The value of R1 should be less than 250k to minimizeerrors in the output voltage caused by the ADJ pin bias\ncurrent.\nThe adjustable device is tested and specified with the ADJ\npin tied to the OUT pin and a 5 µA DC load (unless otherwise\nspecified) for an output voltage of 1.24V. Specificationsfor output voltages greater than 1.24V will be proportionalAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nFigure 1. Adjustable Operationto the ratio of the desired output voltage to 1.24V; (V OUT/\n1.24V). For example, load regulation for an output current\nchange of 1mA to 250mA is –7mV typical at V OUT = 1.24V.\nAt V OUT = 12V, load regulation is:\n(12V/1.24V) • (–7mV) = –68mV\nOutput Capacitance and Transient Response\nThe LT3012B is designed to be stable with a wide range of\noutput capacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor affects\nstability, most notably with small capacitors. A minimum\noutput capacitor of 3.3 µF with an ESR of 3 Ω or less is\nrecommended to prevent oscillations. The LT3012B is a\nmicropower device and output transient response will be\na function of output capacitance. Larger values of outputcapacitance decrease the peak deviations and provide\nimproved transient response for larger load current\nchanges. Bypass capacitors, used to decouple individualcomponents powered by the LT3012B, will increase the\neffective output capacitor value.\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic\ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a\nvariety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across\ntemperature and applied voltage. The most common di-electrics used are specified with EIA temperature charac-\nteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V, X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V\ndielectrics are good for providing high capacitances in asmall package, but they tend to have strong voltage and\ntemperature coefficients as shown in Figures 2 and 3.\nWhen used with a 5V regulator, a 16V 10 µF Y5V capacitor\nVIN\n3012B  F01VOUT\nR2 C1\nR1+\nR2\nR1VOUT = 1.24V\nVADJ = 1.24V\nIADJ = 30nA AT 25 °C\nOUTPUT RANGE = 1.24V TO 60V+ (IADJ)(R2) 1 + ()IN\nLT3012BOUT\nADJ\nGND\n9LT3012B\n3012bfcan exhibit an effective value as low as 1 µF to 2 µF for the\nDC bias voltage applied and over the operating tempera-\nture range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in more\nstable characteristics and are more suitable for use as theoutput capacitor. The X7R type has better stability across\ntemperature, while the X5R is less expensive and is\navailable in higher values. Care still must be exercisedwhen using X5R and X7R capacitors; the X5R and X7R\ncodes only specify operating temperature range and maxi-\nmum capacitance change over temperature. Capacitancechange due to DC bias with X5R and X7R capacitors is\nbetter than Y5V and Z5U capacitors, but can still be\nsignificant enough to drop capacitor values below appro-priate levels. Capacitor DC bias characteristics tend to\nimprove as component case size increases, but expected\ncapacitance at operating voltage should be verified.\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only\nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a\npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generatesvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress,\nsimilar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or micro-\nphone works. For a ceramic capacitor the stress can beinduced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients.\nCurrent Limit and Safe Operating Area Protection\nLike many IC power regulators, the LT3012B has safe\noperating area protection. The safe operating area protec-\ntion decreases the current limit as the input voltage\nincreases and keeps the power transistor in a safe operat-ing region. The protection is designed to provide someoutput current at all values of input voltage up to the device\nbreakdown (see curve of Current Limit vs Input Voltage in\nthe Typical Performance Characteristics).\nThe LT3012B is limited for operating conditions by maxi-\nmum junction temperature. While operating at maximum\ninput voltage, the output current range must be limited;when operating at maximum output current, the input\nvoltage range must be limited. Device specifications will\nnot apply for all possible combinations of input voltageand output current. Operating the LT3012B beyond the\nmaximum junction temperature rating may impair the life\nof the device.\nThermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device will be limited\nby the maximum rated junction temperature (125 °C). The\npower dissipated by the device will be made up of two\ncomponents:\n1. Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage\ndifferential: I\nOUT • (VIN – VOUT) and,\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage:\nIGND • VIN.\nThe GND pin current can be found by examining the GND\nPin Current curves in the Typical Performance Character-\nistics. Power dissipation will be equal to the sum of the twocomponents listed above.APPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nFigure 2. Ceramic Capacitor DC Bias Characterics Figure 3.

For con-tinuous normal conditions the maximum junction tem-\nperature rating of 125 °C must not be exceeded. It is\nimportant to give careful consideration to all sources of\nthermal resistance from junction to ambient. Additional\nheat sources mounted nearby must also be considered.\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished\nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board\nand its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated\nthrough-holes can also be used to spread the heat gener-ated by power devices.\nThe following tables list thermal resistance for several\ndifferent board sizes and copper areas.

Transient operation at high input/\noutput differentials is possible. The approximate thermaltime constant for a 2500sq mm 3/32" FR-4 board with\nmaximum topside and backside area for one ounce copper\nis 3 seconds. This time constant will increase as morethermal mass is added (i.e. vias, larger board, and other\ncomponents).\nFor an application with transient high power peaks, aver-\nage power dissipation can be used for junction tempera-\nture calculations as long as the pulse period is significantly\nless than the thermal time constant of the device andboard.\nCalculating Junction Temperature\nExample 1: Given an output voltage of 5V, an input voltage\nrange of 24V to 30V, an output current range of 0mA to\n50mA, and a maximum ambient temperature of 50 °C,\nwhat will the maximum junction temperature be?\nThe power dissipated by the device will be equal to:\nI\nOUT(MAX) • (VIN(MAX) – VOUT) + (I GND • VIN(MAX) )\nwhere:\nIOUT(MAX) = 50mA\nVIN(MAX) = 30V\nIGND at (I OUT = 50mA, V IN = 30V) = 1mA\nSo:\nP = 50mA  • (30V – 5V) + (1mA  • 30V) = 1.28W\nThe thermal resistance will be in the range of 40 °C/W to\n62 °C/W depending on the copper area. So the junction\ntemperature rise above ambient will be approximately\nequal to:\n1.31W  • 50 °C/W = 65.5 °CAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\n11LT3012B\n3012bfAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nThe maximum junction temperature will then be equal to\nthe maximum junction temperature rise above ambient\nplus the maximum ambient temperature or:\nTJMAX = 50 °C + 65.5 °C = 115.5 °C\nExample 2: Given an output voltage of 5V, an input voltageof 48V that rises to 72V for 5ms(max) out of every 100ms,\nand a 5mA load that steps to 50mA for 50ms out of every250ms, what is the junction temperature rise above ambi-\nent? Using a 500ms period (well under the time constant\nof the board), power dissipation is as follows:\nP1(48V in, 5mA load) = 5mA • (48V – 5V)\n+ (200 µA • 48V) = 0.23W\nP2(48V in, 50mA load) = 50mA • (48V – 5V)\n+ (1mA • 48V) = 2.20W\nP3(72V in, 5mA load) = 5mA • (72V – 5V)\n+ (200 µA • 72V) = 0.35W\nP4(72V in, 50mA load) = 50mA • (72V – 5V)\n+ (1mA • 72V) = 3.42W\nOperation at the different power levels is as follows:\n76% operation at P1, 19% for P2, 4% for P3, and\n1% for P4.\nP\nEFF = 76%(0.23W) + 19%(2.20W) + 4%(0.35W)\n+ 1%(3.42W) = 0.64W\nWith a thermal resistance in the range of 40 °C/W to\n62 °C/W, this translates to a junction temperature rise\nabove ambient of 26 °C to 38 °C.Protection Features\nThe LT3012B incorporates several protection features\nwhich make it ideal for use in battery-powered circuits. In\naddition to the normal protection features associated withmonolithic regulators, such as current limiting and ther-\nmal limiting, the device is protected against reverse-input\nvoltages, and reverse voltages from output to input.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection\nare intended to protect the device against current overload\nconditions at the output of the device. For normal opera-tion, the junction temperature should not exceed 125 °C.\nThe input of the device will withstand reverse voltages of80V. No negative voltage will appear at the output. Thedevice will protect both itself and the load. This provides\nprotection against batteries which can be plugged in\nbackward.\nThe ADJ pin of the device can be pulled above or below\nground by as much as 7V without damaging the device. If\nthe input is left open circuit or grounded, the ADJ pin willact like an open circuit when pulled below ground, and like\na large resistor (typically 100k) in series with a diode when\npulled above ground. If the input is powered by a voltagesource, pulling the ADJ pin below the reference voltage\nwill cause the device to current limit. This will cause the\noutput to go to a unregulated high voltage. Pulling the ADJpin above the reference voltage will turn off all output\ncurrent.\n12LT3012B\n3012bfAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nIn situations where the ADJ pin is connected to a resistor\ndivider that would pull the ADJ pin above its 7V clamp\nvoltage if the output is pulled high, the ADJ pin input\ncurrent must be limited to less than 5mA.  For example, aresistor divider is used to provide a regulated 1.5V output\nfrom the 1.24V reference when the output is forced to 60V.\nThe top resistor of the resistor divider must be chosen tolimit the current into the ADJ pin to less than 5mA when the\nADJ pin is at 7V. The 53V difference between the OUT and\nADJ pins divided by the 5mA maximum current into theADJ pin yields a minimum top resistor value of 10.6k.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several\ndifferent input/output conditions can occur. The outputvoltage may be held up while the input is either pulled to\nFigure 4.

Current flow back into the output will follow\nthe curve shown in Figure 4. The rise in reverse output\ncurrent above 7V occurs from the breakdown of the 7Vclamp on the ADJ pin. With a resistor divider on the\nregulator output, this current will be reduced depending\non the size of the resistor divider.\nWhen the IN pin of the LT3012B is forced below the OUT\npin or the OUT pin is pulled above the IN pin, input current\nwill typically drop to less than 2 µA. This can happen if the\ninput of the LT3012B is connected to a discharged (low\nvoltage) battery and the output is held up by either a\nbackup battery or a second regulator circuit.\n13LT3012B\n3012bf+\nADJOUT IN\nLT3012B\nGND1µF 3.3 µF750kVIN\n12V\n(LATER 42V)LOAD: CLOCK, \nSECURITY SYSTEM\nETC\n+\n– ADJOUT IN\nLT3012B\nGND1µF 3.3 µFVIN\n48V\n(72V TRANSIENT)\nLOAD: \nSYSTEM MONITOR\nETCNO PROTECTION\nDIODE NEEDED!\nNO PROTECTION\nDIODE NEEDED!\n3012B TA05BACKUP\nBATTERY249k\n750k\n249kLT3012B Automotive Application\nLT3012B Telecom  Application\nConstant Brightness for Indicator LED over Wide Input Voltage Range\nIN\nLT3012B 1µFRETURN\n–48VOUT\nADJ\nGND\n3012B TA063.3 µF\nRSET\nILED = 1.24V/R SET\n–48V CAN VARY FROM –4V TO –80VTYPICAL APPLICATIO SU\n14LT3012B\n3012bf\nUPACKAGE DESCRIPTIO\nDE/UE Package\n12-Lead Plastic DFN (4mm × 3mm)\n(Reference LTC DWG # 05-08-1695 Rev C)\n4.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)\n3.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
