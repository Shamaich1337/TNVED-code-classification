This is a \nstress rating only; functional operation of the product at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational  \nsection of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may affect product reliability.  \nTHERMAL DATA  \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individual ly only, not in \ncombination. The ADM7170 can be damaged when the \njunction temperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient \ntemperature  does not guarantee that T J is within the specified \ntempe rature limits. In applications with high power dissipation \nand poor thermal resistance , the maximum  ambient temperature  \nmay need  to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low printed circuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the max imum \nambient temperature can exceed the maximum limit provided \nthat the junction temperature is within specification limits. The \njunction temperature (T\nJ) of the device is dependent on the \nambient temperature (T A), the power dissipation of the device \n(PD), and the junction -to-ambient thermal resistance of the \npackage (θ JA).  \nMaximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated from the \nambient temperature (T A) and power dissipation (P D) using the \nformula  \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) \nJunction -to-ambient thermal resistan ce (θ JA) of the package is \nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4 -layer board. The \njunction -to-ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on \nthe application and board layout. In applications where high \nmaximum  power dissipation exists, close atten tion to thermal \nboard design is required. The value of θ JA may vary, depending on PCB material,  layout, and environmental conditions. The \nspecified values of θ JA are based on a 4 -layer,  4 in. × 3 in. circuit \nboard. See  JESD51 -7 and JESD 51-9 for detailed in formation on \nthe board construction. For additional information, see the \nAN-617 Application Note , Wafer Level Chip Scale Package , \navailable at www.analog.com . \nΨJB is the junction -to-board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W . Ψ JB of the package is based on modeling and \ncalculation using a 4 -layer board. The JESD51 -12, Guidelines for \nReporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information , \nstates that thermal characterization parameters are not the same \nas thermal resistances . ΨJB measures  the component  power \nflowing through multiple thermal paths rather than a single path as in thermal resistance, θ\nJB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths \ninclude conv ection from the top of the package as well as \nradiation from the package, factors that make Ψ JB more useful \nin real -world applications.

D | Page 16 of 23 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM7170 is a low quiescent current, low dropout linear \nregulator that operates from 2.3 V to 6.5 V and provides up to \n500 mA of load  current. Drawing a low 3.0 mA of quiescent \ncurrent (typical) at full load makes the ADM7170 ideal for \nportable equipment. Typical shutdown current consumption is 0.25 μA at room temperature.  \nOptimized for use with small 4.7 µF ceramic capacitors, the \nADM7170 provides excellent transient performance.  \nVOUT\nSENSE\nSSGNDCURRENT-LIMIT,\nTHERMAL\nPROTECT\nSOFT STARTREFERENCE\nSHUTDOWN ENVIN\n12297-056 \nFigure 54. Internal Block Diagram   \nInternally, the ADM7170 consists of a reference, an error \namplifier, a feedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass transistor. Output current is delivered via  the PMOS pass \ndevice, which is controlled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback \nvoltage from the output and amplifies the difference. When  the \nfeedback voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the gate  \nof the PMOS device is pulled lower, allowing more current to \npass and increasing the output voltage. When  the feedback \nvoltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing less current to pass and \ndecr easing the output voltage.  The ADM7170 is available in 17  fixed output voltage options , \nranging from 1. 2 V  t o  5  V.  T h e  ADM7170 architecture allows \nany fixed output voltage to be set to a higher voltage with an  \nexternal  voltage divider. For example, a fixed 5 V output \nADM7170 can be set to a 6 V output according to the following \nequation:  \nV\nOUT = 5 V (1 + R1 /R2) \nVOUT\nSENSEVINADM7170\nGNDVIN VOUT\nSSCSS\n1nFCIN\n4.7µFCOUT\n4.7µF\nEN\nOFFONVIN = 6.5V VOUT = 6.0V\nR1\n2kΩ\nR2\n10kΩ\n12297-057 \nFigure 55. Typical Adjustable Output Voltage Application Schematic \nUse a value of less than 200 kΩ for R2 to minimize errors in  the \noutput voltage caused by the SENSE pin input current. For \nexample,  when R1 and R2 each equal 200 kΩ and the default \noutput voltage is 1.2 V , the adjusted output voltage  is 2.4 V . The \noutput v oltage error introduced by the SENSE pin input current is  \n0.1 mV or 0.004%, assuming a typical SENSE pin input bias \ncurrent of 1 nA at 25°C.  \nThe ADM7170 uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT \npins under normal operating conditions. When EN is high,  VOUT \nturns on ; when EN is low, V OUT turns off. For automatic startup, \ntie EN to VIN ( Pin 7 or Pin 8). \n \n \nData Sheet  ADM7170  \n \nRev.

ADIsimPower is a collection of tools that produce complete \npower designs optimized for a specific design goal.

They are not without limitations , however. \nDepending on the dielectric material, the capacitance can vary dramatically with temperature, dc bias, and ac signal level. Therefore, selec ting the proper capacitor results in the best \ncircuit performance.  \nOutput Capacitor  \nThe ADM7170 is designed for operation with small, space -\nsaving ceramic capacitors but functions with most commonly used capacitors as long as care is taken with regard to the ESR value. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the stability of the LDO control  loop. A minimum of 4.7 µF capacitance with an \nESR of 0.05 Ω or less is recommended to ensure the stability of the \nADM7170.  Transient response to changes in load current is also \naffected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of output \ncapacitance improves the transient response of the ADM7170 to \nlarge changes in load current. Figure 56 shows the transient \nresponses for an outpu t capacitance value of 4.7 µF.  \n12297-058CH1  200mA ΩBWCH2  10mVBWM2.0µs A  CH1      160mA\nT  9.8%1\n2T\n \nFigure 56. Output Transient Response, V OUT = 5 V, C OUT = 4.7 µF  \n Input Bypass Capacitor  \nConnecting a 4.7 µF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the circuit sensitivity to PCB layout, especially when long input traces or a high source impedance is encountered. If greater \nthan 4.7 µF of output capacitance is required, increase the input \ncapacitor to match it.  \nInput and Output Capacitor Properties  \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the \nADM7170 if they meet the minimum capacitance and \nmaximum ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufac -\ntured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior \nover temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors require  a \ndielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over  \nthe necessary temperature range and dc bias conditio ns. X5R  \nor X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of 6.3 V to 100 V are \nrecommended. Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are not recommended, due to their poor temperature and dc bias characteristics.  \nFigure 57 depicts the ca pacitance vs. dc bias voltage of a  0805, \n4.7 µF, 16 V , X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a capacitor is \nstrongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In \ngeneral, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage rating \nexhibits better  stability. The temperature variation of the X5R \ndielectric is ~±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range and is not a function of package or voltage rating.

D | Page 18 of 23 The tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed to be 10%, and \nCBIAS is 4.35 μF at 3.0 V , as shown in Figure 57. \nSubstituting these values in Equation 1 yields  \nCEFF = 4.35 μF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 3.33 μF  \nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meet s the \nminimum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temper -\nature and tolerance at the chosen output voltage of 3.0 V .  \nTo guarantee the performance of the ADM7170, it is imperative \nthat the effects of dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on the behavior of the capacitors be evaluated for each application.  \nPROGRAM MABLE PRECISION ENABL E \nThe ADM7170 uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT \npins under normal operating con ditions.

This \nprevents on/off oscillations that can occur due to noise  on the EN pin as it passes through the threshold points.  \nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT  \nThe ADM7170 also incorporates an internal undervoltage \nlockout circuit to disable the output voltage when the input voltage is less than the minimum input voltage rating of the regulator.

This hysteresis prevents on/off \noscillations that can occur when caused by noise on the input \nvoltage as it passes through the threshold points.  \nSOFT START  \nThe ADM7170 uses an internal soft start (SS pin open) to limit the \ninrush current  when the output is enabled. The start -up time for \nthe 5.0 V option is approximat ely 380 μs from the time the EN \nactive threshold is crossed to when the output reaches 90% of its \nfinal value. As shown in Figure 60, the start- up time is nearly \nindependent of the output voltage setting.

Typical Soft Start Behavior, Different C SS Values  \nNOISE REDUCTION OF T HE ADM7170  IN \nADJUSTABLE MODE  \nThe ultralow output noise of the ADM7170 is achieved by \nkeeping the LDO error amplifier in unity gain and setting the \nreference voltage equal to the output voltage. This architecture \ndoes not work for an adjustable output voltage LDO in the \nconventional se nse. However, the  ADM7170 architecture allows \nany fixed output voltage to be set to a higher voltage with an external voltage divide r. For example, the  adjustable (1.2 V in \nunity gain) output ADM7170 can be set to a 6 V output \naccording to the following equation:  \nV\nOUT = 1.2 V(1 + R1 /R2) \nThe disadvantage of using the ADM7170 in this manner is that \nthe output voltage noise is proportional to the  output voltage. \nTherefore, it is best to choose a fixed output voltage that is close to the target voltage to minimize the increase in output noise.  \nThe adjustable LDO circuit can be modified to reduce the output voltage noise to levels close to that of the fixed output ADM7170. The circuit shown in Figure 62 adds two additional \ncomponents to the output voltage setting resistor divider. C\nNR \nand R NR are added in parallel with R FB1 to reduce the ac gain of \nthe error amplifier. R NR is chosen to be small with respect to \nRFB2. If R NR is 1% to 10% of the value of R FB2, the minimum ac \ngain of the error amplifier is approxi mately 0.1 dB to 0.8 dB. \nThe actual gain is determined by the parallel combination of R\nNR and R FB1. This ensures that the error amplifier always \noperates at slightly greater than unity ga in. CNR is chosen by setting the reactance of C NR equal to R FB1 −  \nRNR at a frequency between 0.5 Hz and 10 Hz. This sets the \nfrequency where the ac gain of the error amplifier is 3 dB  \nless than its dc gain.  \nVOUT\nSENSEVINADM7170\nGNDVIN VOUT\nSSCSS\n1nFCIN\n4.7µFCOUT\n4.7µFCNR\n1µF\nEN\nOFFONVIN = 6.5V VOUT = 6.0V\nRFB1\n200kΩ\nRFB2\n50kΩRNR\n5kΩ\n12297-064 \nFigure 62. Noise Reduction Modification  \nAssuming the noise of a fixed output LDO is approximately 5 μ V,  identify  the noise of the adjustable LDO by using the \nfollowing formula : \nNoise  = 5 μV × ( R\nPAR + RFB2)/RFB2 \nwhere RPAR is the parallel combination of R FB1 and RNR. \nBased on the component values shown in Figure 62, the \nADM7170 has the following characteristics:  \n• DC gain of 5 (14 dB)  \n• 3 dB roll -off frequency of 0.8 Hz  \n• High frequency ac gain of 1.09 (0.75 dB)  \n• Noise reduction factor of 4.42 (12.91 dB)  \n• RMS noise of the adjustable LDO without noise reduction of 25  µV rms  \n• RMS noise of the adjustable LDO with noise reduction (assuming 5 µV r ms for fixed voltage option) of 5.5 µV rms  \nEFFECT OF NOISE REDU CTION ON START -UP TIME  \nThe start -up time of the ADM7170 is affected by the noise \nreduction network and must  be consid ered in applications \nwherein  power supply sequencing is critical. \nThe noise reduction  circuit adds a pole in the feedback loop \nthat slows down the start -up time. The start -up time for an \nadjustable model with a noise reduction network can be \napproximated  using the following equation:  \nSSNR TIME (sec) = 5.5 × CNR × (RNR + RFB1) \nFor a C NR, RNR, and R FB1 combination o f 1 µF, 5 kΩ, and 200 kΩ, \nrespectively,  as shown  in Figure 62, the star t-up time is \napproximately 1.1  seconds . When SSNR TIME is greater than \nSSTIME, it dictate s the length of the start -up time instead of the \nsoft start capacitor.  \nCURRENT -LIMIT AND TH ERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION  \nThe ADM7170 is protected against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by  current -limit and thermal overload \nprotection circuits. The ADM7170 is designed to cu rrent limit \nwhen the output load reaches 3 A (typical). When the output \nload exceeds 3 A, the output voltage is reduced to maintain a \nconstant current limit.  \nADM7170  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 20 of 23 Thermal overload protection is included, which limits the \njunction temperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under \nextreme conditions (that is, high ambient temperature and/or high power dissipation) when the junction temperature starts to rise above 150°C, the output is turned off, reducing the output current to zero. When the junction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on again, and the output current is \nrestored to its operating value.  \nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to ground occurs. At first, the ADM7170 current limits, so that only 3 A  is \nconducted into the short. If self heating of the junction is great enough to cause its temperature to rise abo ve 150°C, thermal \nshutdown activates, turning off the output and reducing the output current to zero. As the junction temperature cools and drops \nbelow 135°C, the output turns on and conducts 3 A into the \nshort, again causing the junction temperature to ri se above \n150°C. This thermal oscillation between 135°C and 150°C causes a current oscillation between 3  A and 0  mA that \ncontinues for as long as the short remains at the outpu t. \nCurrent -limit and thermal limit protections are intended to \nprotect the device  against accidental overload conditions. For \nreliable operation, device power dissipation must be externally \nlimited so that the junction temperature does not exceed 125°C.  \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIO NS \nIn applications with low input -to-output voltage differentia l, the \nADM7170 does not dissipate much heat. However, in applications  \nwith high ambien t temperature and/or high input voltage , the heat \ndissipated in the package may become large enough that it causes the junction temperature of the die to exceed the maximum junction temperature of 125°C.  \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the co nverter \nenters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction \ntemper ature has decreased below 135°C to prevent any permanent \ndamage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application \nis very important to guarantee reliable performance over all conditions. The junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient temperature of the environment and the tempera -\nture rise of the package due to the power dissipation, as shown in Equation 2.  \nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperatur e of  \nthe ADM7170 must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the \njunction temperature stays  below this maximum value, the  \nuser must be aware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature changes. These parameters include ambient temperature , power dissipation in the power device,  \nand thermal resistances between the junction and amb ient air \n(θ\nJA). The θ JA number is dependent on the package assembly \ncompounds that are used and the  amount of copper used to \nsolder the package GND pin to the PCB.  \nTable 7 shows typical θ JA values of the 8 -lead LFC SP package for \nvarious PCB copper sizes. The typical value of Ψ JB is 15.1°C/W for \nthe 8 -lead LFCSP package.  Table 7.

Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies to the following:  \nT\nJ = TA + ((( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD) × θJA) (4) \nAs shown in Equation 4, for a given  ambient temperature , input -\nto-output voltage differential, and continuous load current, a \nminimum copper size requirement exists for the PCB to ensure that the junction temperature does not rise above 125°C.

**Description:**
The ADM7170 is a CMOS low dropout linear regulator (LDO) designed to provide a stable output voltage with high power supply rejection and low noise. It operates within an input voltage range of 2.3 V to 6.5 V and can deliver up to 500 mA of output current. The device is optimized for use with small ceramic capacitors, making it suitable for compact applications.

**Typical Applications:**
The ADM7170 is ideal for noise-sensitive applications, including:
- Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC)
- Precision amplifiers
