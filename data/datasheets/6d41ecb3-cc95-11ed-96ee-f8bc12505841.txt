The data sheet details which pins have internal pullups \nor pulldowns and which pins require external pull resistors.\nEven though a device may have internal pullup or pulldown resistors, a good practice is to terminate \nunused inputs rather than allowing them to float. Floating inputs could result in unstable conditions. This \nrecommendation does not apply to VDD1P8 pins. When unused, these pins should be left floating.  It is \nconsidered a safer practice to pull an unused input pin high or low with a pullup or pulldown resistor. It is \nalso possible to group together adjacent unused input pins, and as a group pull them up or down using a single \nresistor.DP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\n7 Specifications\n7.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings\nover operating free-air temperature range (unless otherwise noted) (1)\nMIN MAX UNIT\nSupply voltageVDDA2P5 –0.3 3\nVVDDA1P8 –0.3 2.1\n(VDD1P1/VDD1P0) –0.3 1.3\nVDDIO3.3-V option –0.3 3.8\n2.5-V option –0.3 3\n1.8-V option –0.3 2.1\nPinsMDI –0.3 6.5\nVMAC interface, MDIO, MDC, GPIO –0.3 VDDIO + 0.3\nINT/PWDN, RESET –0.3 VDDIO + 0.3\nJTAG –0.3 VDDIO + 0.3\nXI (Oscillator Clock Input) –0.3 2.1 V\nStorage temperature, T stg –60 150 °C\n(1) Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings  may cause permanent damage to the device.

The DP83867 can be configured to generate an interrupt to wake up the MAC \nwhen a qualifying packet is received. An option is also available to generate a signal on a GPIO when a \nqualifying signal is received.\nNote\nPlease ensure that BMCR (register address 0x0000) bit[10] is disabled, when using the WoL feature. \nThis bit enables the MII ISOLATE function used to disable the MAC interface of the PHY, also \ndisabling the WoL interrupt on this PHY. If the WoL feature is needed while MII ISOLATE is enabled \nplease use TI\'s DP83869HM PHY instead.\nThe Wake-on-LAN feature includes the following functionality:\n•Identification of magic packets in all supported speeds (1000BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, 10BASE-Te)\n•Wakeup interrupt generation upon receiving a valid magic packet\n•CRC checking of magic packets to prevent interrupt generation for invalid packets\nIn addition to the basic magic packet support, the DP83867 also supports:\n•Magic packets that include secure-on password\n•Pattern match – one configurable 64 byte pattern of that can wake up the MAC similar to magic packet\n•Independent configuration for Wake on Broadcast and Unicast packet types.\n8.3.1.1 Magic Packet Structure\nWhen configured for Magic Packet mode, the DP83867 scans all incoming frames addressed to the node for a \nspecific data sequence. This sequence identifies the frame as a Magic Packet frame.\nNote\nThe Magic Packet should be byte aligned.\nA Magic Packet frame must also meet the basic requirements for the LAN technology chosen, such as SOURCE \nADDRESS, DESTINATION ADDRESS (which may be the receiving station’s IEEE address or a BROADCAST \naddress), and CRC.\nThe specific Magic Packet sequence consists of 16 duplications of the IEEE address of this node, with no breaks \nor interruptions, followed by secure-on password if security is enabled. This sequence can be located anywhere \nwithin the packet, but must be preceded by a synchronization stream. The synchronization stream is defined as \n6 bytes of FFh.DP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n34 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nDEST * 16DEST (6 bytes)\nSRC (6 bytes)\nMISC (X bytes, X >= 0)\n))«\x03))\x03 (6 bytes)\nMISC (Y bytes, Y >= 0)\nCRC (4 bytes)MAGIC pattern\nSecureOn Password (6 bytes) Only if Secure-On is enabledFigure 8-3.

Wake-on-LAN status \nis reported in the RXFSTS register (address 0x0135).\n8.3.2 Start of Frame Detect for IEEE 1588 Time Stamp\nThe DP83867 supports an IEEE 1588 indication pulse at the SFD (start frame delimiter) for the receive and \ntransmit paths. The pulse can be delivered to various pins. The pulse indicates the actual time the symbol is \npresented on the lines (for transmit), or the first symbol received (for receive). The exact timing of the pulse can \nbe adjusted through register. Each increment of phase value is an 8-ns step.\nFigure 8-4. IEEE 1588 Message Timestamp Pointwww.ti.comDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 35\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nThe SFD pulse output can be configured using the GPIO Mux Control registers, GPIO_MUX_CTRL1 (register \naddress 0x0171) and GPIO_MUX_CTRL2 (register address 0x0172). The RGZ devices support only register \nGPIO_MUX_CTRL2 (address 0x172).\nFor more information about configuring the DP83867\'s SFD feature, see the How to Configure DP83867 Start of \nFrame  application report (SNLA242).\n8.3.2.1 SFD Latency Variation and Determinism\nTime stamping packet transmission and reception using the RX_CTRL and TX_CTRL signals of RGMII is not \naccurate enough for latency sensitive protocols. SFD pulses offers system designers a method to improve the \naccuracy of packet time stamping. The SFD pulse, while varying less than RGMII signals inherently, still exhibits \nlatency variation due to the defined architecture of 1000BASE-T. This section provides a method to determine \nwhen an SFD latency variation has occurred and how to compensate for the variation in system software to \nimprove timestamp accuracy.\nIn the following section the terms baseline latency and SFD variation are used. Baseline latency is the time \nmeasured between the TX_SFD pulse to the RX_SFD pulse of a connected link partner, assuming an Ethernet \ncable with all 4 pairs perfectly matched in propagation time. In the scenario where all 4 pairs being perfectly \nmatched, a 1000BASE-T PHY will not have to align the 4 received symbols on the wire and will not introduce \nextra latency due to alignment.\nTX SFD\nRX SFDBaseline Latency\nSFD Variation\nFigure 8-5. Baseline Latency and SFD Variation in Latency Measurement\nSFD variation is additional time added to the baseline latency before the RX_SFD pulse when the PHY must \nintroduce latency to align the 4 symbols from the Ethernet cable. Variation can occur when a new link is \nestablished either by cable connection, auto-negotiation restart, PHY reset, or other external system effects. \nDuring a single, uninterrupted link, the SFD variation will remain constant.\nThe DP83867 can limit and report the variation applied to the SFD pulse while in the 1000-Mb operating mode. \nBefore a link is established in 1000-Mb mode, the Sync FIFO Control Register (register address 0x00E9) must \nbe set to value 0xDF22. The below SFD variation compensation method can only be applied after the Sync FIFO \nControl Register has been initialized and a new link has been established. It is acceptable to set the Sync FIFO \nControl register value and then perform a software restart by setting the SW_RESTART bit[14] in the Control \nRegister (register address 0x001F) if a link is already present.\n8.3.2.1.1 1000-Mb SFD Variation in Master Mode\nWhen the DP83867 is operating in 1000-Mb master mode, variation of the RX_SFD pulse can be estimated \nusing the Skew FIFO Status register (register address 0x0055) bit[7:4]. The value read from the Skew FIFO \nStatus register bit[7:4] must be multiplied by 8 ns to estimate the RX_SFD variation added to the baseline \nlatency.\nExample: While operating in master 1000-Mb mode, a value of 0x2 is read from the Skew FIFO register bit[7:4].\n2 × 8 ns = 16 ns is subtracted from the TX_SFD to RX_SFD measurement to determine the baseline latency.\n8.3.2.1.2 1000-Mb SFD Variation in Slave Mode\nWhen the DP83867 is operating in 1000-Mb slave mode, the variation of the RX_SFD pulse can be determined \nusing the Skew FIFO Status register (register address 0x0055) bit[3:0].The value read from the Skew FIFO \nStatus register bit[3:0] should be multiplied by 8ns to estimate the RX_SFD variation added to the baseline \nlatency.DP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n36 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nExample: While operating in slave 1000-Mb mode, a value of 0x1 is read from the Skew FIFO register bit[3:0].\n1 × 8 ns = 8 ns is subtracted from the TX_SFD to RX_SFD measurement to determine the baseline latency.\n8.3.2.1.3 100-Mb SFD Variation\nThe latency variation in 100-Mb mode of operation is determined by random process and does not require any \nregister readout or system level compensation of SFD pulses.\n8.3.3 Clock Output\nThe DP83867  has several internal clocks, including the local reference clock, the Ethernet transmit clock, and \nthe Ethernet receive clock. An external crystal or oscillator provides the stimulus for the local reference clock. \nThe local reference clock acts as the central source for all clocking in the device.\nThe local reference clock is embedded into the transmit network packet traffic and is recovered from the network \npacket traffic at the receiver node. The receive clock is recovered from the received Ethernet packet data stream \nand is locked to the transmit clock in the partner.\nUsing the I/O Configuration register (address 0x0170), the DP83867  can be configured to output these internal \nclocks through the CLK_OUT pin. By default, the output clock is synchronous to the XI oscillator / crystal input. \nThrough registers, the output clock can be configured to be synchronous to the receive data at the 125-MHz \ndata rate or at the divide by 5 rate of 25 MHz. It can also be configured to output the line driver transmit clock. \nWhen operating in 1000Base-T mode, the output clock can be configured for any of the four transmit or receive \nchannels.\nThe output clock can be disabled using the CLK_O_DISABLE bit of the I/O Configuration register. It can also be \ndisabled by default using the Clock Out Disable strap. This strap is only available for the PAP devices. For more \ninformation, see Section 8.5.1 .\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 MAC Interfaces\nThe DP83867  supports connection to an Ethernet MAC via the following interfaces: RGMII , GMII, and MII .\nThe RGMII Disable strap (RX_D6) determines the default state of the MAC interface. The RGMII Disable strap \ncorresponds to the RGMII Enable (bit 7) in the RGMIICTL register (address 0x0032). When RGMII mode is \ndisabled, the DP83867  operates in GMII mode.\nRGMII ENABLE (Register 0x0032, bit 7) DEVICE FUNCTIONAL MODE\n0x1 RGMII\n0x0 GMII\nThe initial strap value for the RGMII disable is also available in the Strap Configuration Status Register 1 \n(STRAP_STS1).\n8.4.1.1 Reduced GMII (RGMII)\nThe Reduced Gigabit Media Independent Interface (RGMII) is designed to reduce the number of pins required \nto interconnect the MAC and PHY (12 pins for RGMII relative to 24 pins for GMII). To accomplish this goal, the \ndata paths and all associated control signals are reduced and are multiplexed. Both rising and trailing edges \nof the clock are used. For Gigabit operation the GTX_CLK and RX_CLK clocks are 125 MHz, and for 10- and \n100-Mbps operation, the clock frequencies are 2.5 MHz and 25 MHz, respectively.\nFor more information about RGMII timing, see the RGMII Interface Timing Budgets  application report \n(SNLA243).\n8.4.1.1.1 1000-Mbps Mode Operation\nAll RGMII signals are positive logic. The 8-bit data is multiplexed by taking advantage of both clock edges. The \nlower 4 bits are latched on the positive clock edge and the upper 4 bits are latched on trailing clock edge. The \ncontrol signals are multiplexed into a single clock cycle using the same technique.www.ti.comDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 37\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nTo reduce power consumption of RGMII interface, TXEN_ER and RXDV_ER are encoded in a manner that \nminimizes transitions during normal network operation. This is done by following encoding method. Note that the \nvalue of GMII_TX_ER and GMII_TX_EN are valid at the rising edge of the clock. In RGMII mode, GMII_ TX_ER \nis presented on TX_CTRL at the falling edge of the GTX_CLK clock. RX_CTRL coding is implemented the same \nfashion.\nWhen receiving a valid frame with no error, RX_CTRL = True  is generated as a logic high on the rising edge of \nRX_CLK and RX_CTRL = False  is generated as a logic high at the falling edge of RX_CLK. When no frame is \nbeing received, RX_CTRL = False  is generated as a logic low on the rising edge of RX_CLK and RX_CTRL = \nFalse  is generated as a logic low on the falling edge of RX_CLK.\nTX_CTRL is treated in a similar manner. During normal frame transmission, the signal stays at a logic high for \nboth edges of GTX_CLK and during the period between frames where no error is indicated, the signal stays low \nfor both edges.\n8.4.1.1.2 1000-Mbps Mode Timing\nThe DP83867  provides configurable clock skew for the GTX_CLK and RX_CLK to optimize timing across the \ninterface. The transmit and receive paths can be optimized independently. Both the transmit and receive path \nsupport 16 programmable RGMII delay modes via register configuration.\nThe timing paths can either be configured for Aligned mode or Shift mode. In Aligned mode, no clock skew is \nintroduced. In Shift mode, the clock skew can be introduced in 0.25 ns increments (via register configuration). \nConfiguration of the Aligned mode or Shift mode is accomplished via the RGMII Control Register (RGMIICTL), \naddress 0x0032. In Shift mode, the clock skew can be adjusted using the RGMII Delay Control Register \n(RGMIIDCTL), address 0x0086.\n8.4.1.1.3 10- and 100-Mbps Mode\nWhen the RGMII interface is operating in the 100-Mbps mode, the Ethernet Media Independent Interface (MII) \nis implemented by reducing the clock rate to 25 MHz. For 10-Mbps operation, the clock is further reduced to 2.5 \nMHz. In the RGMII 10/100 mode, the transmit clock RGMII TX_CLK is generated by the MAC and the receive \nclock RGMII RX_CLK is generated by the PHY. During the packet receiving operation, the RGMII RX_CLK may \nbe stretched on either the positive or negative pulse to accommodate the transition from the free-running clock \nto a data synchronous clock domain. When the speed of the PHY changes, a similar stretching of the positive or \nnegative pulses is allowed. No glitch is allowed on the clock signals during clock speed transitions.\nThis interface operates at 10- and 100-Mbps speeds the same way it does at 1000-Mbps mode with the \nexception that the data may be duplicated on the falling edge of the appropriate clock.\nThe MAC holds the RGMII TX_CLK low until it has ensured that it is operating at the same speed as the PHY.\nPHY\nTX_CTRL\nGTX_CLK\nTX_D [3:0]\nRX_CTRL\nRX_CLK\nRX_D [3:0]MAC\nFigure 8-6.

GMII is available on the PAP devices only. The purpose of GMII is to make various \nphysical media transparent to the MAC layer. The GMII Interface accepts either GMII or MII data, control and \nstatus signals and routes them either to the 1000BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, or 10BASE-Te modules, respectively.\nThe GMII interface has the following characteristics:\n•Supports 10/100/1000 Mbps operation\n•Data and delimiters are synchronous to clock references\n•Provides independent 8-bit wide transmit and receive data paths\n•Provides a simple management interface\n•Provides for Full-Duplex operation\nThe GMII interface is defined in IEEE 802.3 Clause 35. In each direction of data transfer, there are Data (an \neight-bit bundle), Delimiter, Error, and Clock signals. GMII signals are defined such that an implementation may \nmultiplex most GMII signals with the similar PCS service interface defined in IEEE 802.3 Clause 22. Two media \nstatus signals are provided. One indicates the presence of carrier (CRS), and the other indicates the occurrence \nof a collision (COL). The MII signal names have been retained and the functions of most signals are the same, \nbut additional valid combinations of signals have been defined for 1000 Mbps operation.www.ti.comDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 39\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nThe connection diagram for GMII is shown in Figure 8-7 .\nFigure 8-7. GMII Connections\n8.4.1.3 Media Independent Interface (MII)\nMII connections are used for 10/100 data. MII is compatible with GMII and will be used for 10/100 data when the \ndevice is configured for GMII. MII is available on PAP devices only.\nThe DP83867 incorporates the Media Independent Interface (MII) as specified in Clause 22 of the IEEE 802.3 \nstandard. This interface may be used to connect PHY devices to a MAC in 10/100 Mbps systems. This section \ndescribes the nibble wide MII data interface.\nThe nibble wide MII data interface consists of a receive bus and a transmit bus each with control signals to \nfacilitate data transfer between the PHY and the upper layer (MAC).\n8.4.1.3.1 Nibble-wide MII Data Interface\nClause 22 of the IEEE 802.3 specification defines the Media Independent Interface. This interface includes a \ndedicated receive bus and a dedicated transmit bus. These two data buses, along with various control and \nstatus signals, allow for the simultaneous exchange of data between the DP83867 and the upper layer agent \n(MAC).\nThe receive interface consists of a nibble wide data bus RXD[3:0], a receive error signal RX_ER, a receive data \nvalid flag RX_DV, and a receive clock RX_CLK for synchronous transfer of the data. The receive clock operates \nat either 2.5 MHz to support 10 Mbps operation modes or at 25 MHz to support 100 Mbps operational modes.\nThe transmit interface consists of a nibble wide data bus TXD[3:0], a transmit enable control signal TX_EN, and \na transmit clock TX_CLK which runs at either 2.5 MHz or 25 MHz. Additionally, the MII includes the carrier sense \nsignal CRS, as well as a collision detect signal COL. The CRS signal asserts to indicate the reception of data \nfrom the network or as a function of transmit data in Half-Duplex mode. The COL signal asserts as an indication \nof a collision which can occur during Half-Duplex operation when both a transmit and receive operation occur \nsimultaneously.DP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n40 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\n8.4.1.3.2 Collision Detect\nWhen in Half-Duplex mode, a 10BASE-Te or 100BASE-TX collision is detected when the receive and transmit \nchannels are active simultaneously. Collisions are reported by the COL signal on the MII.\nThe COL signal remains set for the duration of the collision. If the PHY is receiving when a collision is detected, \nit is reported immediately (through the COL pin).\nCollision is not indicated during Full-Duplex operation.\n8.4.1.3.3 Carrier Sense\nIn 10 Mbps operation, Carrier Sense (CRS) is asserted due to receive activity once valid data is detected via the \nsquelch function. During 100 Mbps operation CRS is asserted when a valid link (SD) and two non-contiguous \nzeros are detected on the line.\nFor 10 or 100 Mbps Half-Duplex operation, CRS is asserted during either packet transmission or reception.\nFor 10 or 100 Mbps Full-Duplex operation, CRS is asserted only due to receive activity.\nCRS is deasserted following an end of packet.\nThe connection diagram for MII is shown in Figure 8-8 .\nFigure 8-8. MII Connections\n8.4.2 Serial Management Interface\nThe Serial Management Interface (SMI), provides access to the DP83867  internal register space for status \ninformation and configuration. The SMI is compatible with IEEE 802.3-2002 clause 22. The implemented register \nset consists of the registers required by the IEEE 802.3, plus several others to provide additional visibility and \ncontrollability of the DP83867  device.\nThe SMI includes the MDC management clock input and the management MDIO data pin. The MDC clock is \nsourced by the external management entity, also called Station (STA), and can run at a maximum clock rate of \n25 MHz. MDC is not expected to be continuous, and can be turned off by the external management entity when \nthe bus is idle.www.ti.comDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 41\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nThe MDIO is sourced by the external management entity and by the PHY. The data on the MDIO pin is latched \non the rising edge of the MDC clock. The MDIO pin requires a pullup resistor (2.2 k Ω) which, during IDLE and \nturnaround, pulls MDIO high.\nUp to 16 PHYs can share a common SMI bus. To distinguish between the PHYs, a 4-bit address is used. \nDuring power-up reset, the DP83867  latches the PHY_ADD configuration pins to determine its address. The \nDP83867IRPAP 64-pin variant can support up to 32 PHYs and uses a 5-bit address.\nThe management entity must not start an SMI transaction in the first cycle after power-up reset. To maintain \nvalid operation, the SMI bus must remain inactive at least one MDC cycle after hard reset is deasserted. In \nnormal MDIO transactions, the register address is taken directly from the management-frame reg_addr field, \nthus allowing direct access to 32 16-bit registers (including those defined in IEEE 802.3 and vendor specific). \nThe data field is used for both reading and writing. The Start code is indicated by a <01> pattern. This pattern \nmakes sure that the MDIO line transitions from the default idle line state. Turnaround is defined as an idle \nbit time inserted between the Register Address field and the Data field. To avoid contention during a read \ntransaction, no device may actively drive the MDIO signal during the first bit of turnaround. The addressed \nDP83867  drives the MDIO with a zero for the second bit of turnaround and follows this with the required data. \nFigure 8-9  shows the timing relationship between MDC and the MDIO as driven and received by the Station \n(STA) and the DP83867  (PHY) for a typical register read access.\nFor write transactions, the station-management entity writes data to the addressed DP83867 , thus eliminating \nthe requirement for MDIO turnaround. The turnaround time is filled by the management entity by inserting <10>. \nFigure 8-9  shows the timing relationship for a typical MII register write access. The frame structure and general \nread and write transactions are shown in Table 8-1 , Figure 8-9 , and Figure 8-10 .\nTable 8-1.

The SMI function ignores indirect accesses to these registers.\nREGCR (0x000Dh) is the MDIO Manageable MMD access control. In general, register REGCR(4:0) is the \ndevice address DEVAD that directs any accesses of ADDAR (0x000Eh) register to the appropriate MMD.\nThe DP83867  supports one MMD device address. The vendor-specific device address DEVAD[4:0] = 11111 is \nused for general MMD register accesses.\nAll accesses through registers REGCR and ADDAR must use the correct DEVAD. Transactions with other \nDEVAD are ignored. REGCR[15:14] holds the access function: address (00), data with no post increment (01), \ndata with post increment on read and writes (10) and data with post increment on writes only (11).\n•ADDAR is the address and data MMD register. ADDAR is used in conjunction with REGCR to provide \nthe access to the extended register set. If register REGCR[15:1] is 00, then ADDAR holds the address of \nthe extended address space register. Otherwise, ADDAR holds the data as indicated by the contents of \nits address register. When REGCR[15:14] is set to 00, accesses to register ADDAR modify the extended \nregister set address register. This address register must always be initialized to access any of the registers \nwithin the extended register set.\n•When REGCR[15:14] is set to 01, accesses to register ADDAR access the register within the extended \nregister set selected by the value in the address register.\n•When REGCR[15:14] is set to 10, access to register ADDAR access the register within the extended register \nset selected by the value in the address register. After that access is complete, for both reads and writes, the \nvalue in the address register is incremented.\n•When REGCR[15:14] is set to 11, access to register ADDAR access the register within the extended register \nset selected by the value in the address register. After that access is complete, for write accesses only, the \nvalue in the address register is incremented. For read accesses, the value of the address register remains \nunchanged.\nThe following sections describe how to perform operations on the extended register set using register REGCR \nand ADDAR. The descriptions use the device address for general MMD register accesses (DEVAD[4:0] = 11111).\n8.4.2.1.1 Write Address Operation\n1.Write the value 0x001F (address function field = 00, DEVAD = 31) to register REGCR.\n2.Write the desired register address to register ADDAR.\nSubsequent writes to register ADDAR (step 2) continue to write the address register.\n8.4.2.1.2 Read Address Operation\nTo read the address register:\n1.Write the value 0x001F (address function field = 00, DEVAD = 31) to register REGCR.\n2.Read the register address from register ADDAR.\n8.4.2.1.3 Write (No Post Increment) Operation\nTo write a register in the extended register set:\n1.Write the value 0x001F (address function field = 00, DEVAD = 31) to register REGCR.\n2.Write the desired register address to register ADDAR.\n3.Write the value 0x401F (data, no post increment function field = 01, DEVAD = 31) to register REGCR.\n4.Write the content of the desired extended register set register to register ADDAR.\nSubsequent writes to register ADDAR (step 4) continue to rewrite the register selected by the value in the \naddress register.\nNote:  steps (1) and (2) can be skipped if the address register was previously configured.\n8.4.2.1.4 Read (No Post Increment) Operation\nTo read a register in the extended register set:www.ti.comDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 43\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\n1.Write the value 0x001F (address function field = 00, DEVAD = 31) to register REGCR.\n2.Write the desired register address to register ADDAR.\n3.Write the value 0x401F (data, no post increment function field = 01, DEVAD = 31) to register REGCR.\n4.Read the content of the desired extended register set register to register ADDAR.\nSubsequent reads from register ADDAR (step 4) continue reading the register selected by the value in the \naddress register.\nNote : steps (1) and (2) can be skipped if the address register was previously configured.\n8.4.2.1.5 Write (Post Increment) Operation\n1.Write the value 0x001F (address function field = 00, DEVAD = 31) to register REGCR.\n2.Write the register address from register ADDAR.\n3.Write the value 0x801F (data, post increment on reads and writes function field = 10, DEVAD = 31) or the \nvalue 0xC01F (data, post increment on writes function field = 11.

The Auto-Negotiation function in 1000BASE-T \nhas three primary purposes:\n•Auto-Negotiation of Speed and Duplex Selection\n•Auto-Negotiation of Master or Slave Resolution\n•Auto-Negotiation of Pause or Asymetrical Pause ResolutionDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n44 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\n8.4.3.1 Speed and Duplex Selection - Priority Resolution\nThe Auto-Negotiation function provides a mechanism for exchanging configuration information between the two \nends of a link segment. This mechanism is implemented by exchanging Fast Link Pulses (FLP). FLPs are burst \npulses that provide the signalling used to communicate the abilities between two devices at each end of a link \nsegment. For further details regarding Auto-Negotiation, refer to Clause 28 of the IEEE 802.3 specification. \nThe DP83867  supports 1000BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE-T modes of operation. The process of \nAuto-Negotiation ensures that the highest performance protocol is selected (that is, priority resolution) based on \nthe advertised abilities of the Link Partner and the local device.\n8.4.3.2 Master and Slave Resolution\nIf 1000BASE-T mode is selected during the priority resolution, the second goal of Auto-Negotiation is to resolve \nMaster or Slave configuration. The Master mode priority is given to the device that supports multiport nodes, \nsuch as switches and repeaters. Single node devices such as DTE or NIC card takes lower Master mode priority.\n8.4.3.3 Pause and Asymmetrical Pause Resolution\nWhen Full-Duplex operation is selected during priority resolution, the Auto-Negotiation also determines the Flow \nControl capabilities of the two link partners. Flow control was originally introduced to force a busy station’s \nLink Partner to stop transmitting data in Full-Duplex operation. Unlike Half-Duplex mode of operation where \na link partner could be forced to back off by simply generating collisions, the Full-Duplex operation needed a \nmechanism to slow down transmission from a link partner in the event that the receiving station’s buffers are \nbecoming full. A new MAC control layer was added to handle the generation and reception of Pause Frames. \nEach MAC Controller has to advertise whether it is capable of processing Pause Frames. In addition, the MAC \nController advertises if Pause frames can be handled in both directions, that is, receive and transmit. If the MAC \nController only generates Pause frames but does not respond to Pause frames generated by a link partner, it \nis called Asymmetrical Pause. The advertisement of Pause and Asymmetrical Pause capabilities is enabled by \nwriting 1 to bits 10 and 11 of ANAR (register address 0x0004). The link partner’s Pause capabilities is stored in \nANLPAR (register address 0x0005) bits 10 and 11. The MAC Controller has to read from ANLPAR to determine \nwhich Pause mode to operate. The PHY layer is not involved in Pause resolution other than simply advertising \nand reporting of Pause capabilities.\n8.4.3.4 Next Page Support\nThe DP83867  supports the Auto-Negotiation Next Page protocol as required by IEEE 802.3 clause 28.2.4.1.7. \nThe ANNPTR 0x07 allows for the configuration and transmission of the Next Page. Refer to clause 28 of the \nIEEE 802.3 standard for detailed information regarding the Auto-Negotiation Next Page function.\n8.4.3.5 Parallel Detection\nThe DP83867  supports the Parallel Detection function as defined in the IEEE 802.3 specification. Parallel \nDetection requires the 10/100-Mbps receivers to monitor the receive signal and report link status to the Auto-\nNegotiation function. Auto-Negotiation uses this information to configure the correct technology in the event \nthat the Link Partner does not support Auto-Negotiation, yet is transmitting link signals that the 10BASE-Te or \n100BASE-X PMA recognize as valid link signals.\nIf the DP83867  completes Auto-Negotiation as a result of Parallel Detection, without Next Page operation, bits 5 \nand 7 of ANLPAR (register address 0x0005) are set to reflect the mode of operation present in the Link Partner. \nNote that bits 4:0 of the ANLPAR are also set to 00001 based on a successful parallel detection to indicate a \nvalid 802.3 selector field. Software may determine that the negotiation is completed through Parallel Detection \nby reading 0 in bit 0 of ANER (register address 0x006) after Auto-Negotiation Complete, bit 5 of BMSR (register \naddress 0x0001), is set. If the PHY is configured for parallel detect mode and any condition other than a good \nlink occurs, the parallel detect fault, bit 4 of ANER (register address 0x06), sets.\n8.4.3.6 Restart Auto-Negotiation\nIf a link is established by successful Auto-Negotiation and then lost, the Auto-Negotiation process resumes to \ndetermine the configuration for the link. This function ensures that a link can be re-established if the cable \nbecomes disconnected and reconnected. After Auto-Negotiation is completed, it may be restarted at any \ntime by writing 1 to bit 9 of the BMCR (register address 0x0000). A restart Auto-Negotiation request from www.ti.comDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 45\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nany entity, such as a management agent, causes DP83867  to halt data transmission or link pulse activity \nuntil the break_link_timer expires. Consequently, the Link Partner goes into link fail mode and the resume \nAuto-Negotiation. The DP83867  resumes Auto-Negotiation after the break_link_timer has expired by transmitting \nFLP (Fast Link Pulse) bursts.\n8.4.3.7 Enabling Auto-Negotiation Through Software\nIf Auto-Negotiation is disabled by MDIO access, and the user desires to restart Auto-Negotiation, this could be \naccomplished by software access. Bit 12 of BMCR (register address 0x00) should be cleared and then set for \nAuto-Negotiation operation to take place.\nIf Auto-Negotiation is disabled by strap option, Auto-Negotiation can not be reenabled.\n8.4.3.8 Auto-Negotiation Complete Time\nParallel detection and Auto-Negotiation typically take 2-3 seconds to complete. In addition, Auto-Negotiation with \nnext page exchange takes approximately 2-3 seconds to complete, depending on the number of next pages \nexchanged. Refer to Clause 28 of the IEEE 802.3 standard for a full description of the individual timers related to \nAuto-Negotiation\n8.4.3.9 Auto-MDIX Resolution\nThe DP83867  can determine if a straight  or crossover  cable is used to connect to the link partner. It \ncan automatically re-assign channel A and B to establish link with the link partner, (and channel C and \nD in 1000BASE-T mode). Auto-MDIX resolution precedes the actual Auto-Negotiation process that involves \nexchange of FLPs to advertise capabilities. Automatic MDI/MDIX is described in IEEE 802.3 Clause 40, section \n40.8.2. It is not a required implementation for 10BASE-Te and 100BASE-TX. DP83867 devices manufactured \nafter August, 2022, have an increased random seed value that now includes 255 different seed values to \nexpedite Auto-MDIX resolution with a link partner.\nFor 10/100, Auto-MDIX is independent of Auto-Negotiation. Auto-MDIX works in both Auto-Negotiation mode \nand manual forced speed mode.\n8.4.4 Loopback Mode\nThere are several options for Loopback that test and verify various functional blocks within the PHY. Enabling \nloopback mode allows in-circuit testing of the digital and analog data paths. Generally, the DP83867  may \nbe configured to one of the Near-end loopback modes or to the Far-end (reverse) loopback. MII Loopback \nis configured using the BMCR (register address 0x0000). All other loopback modes are enabled using the \nBISCR (register address 0x16). Except where otherwise noted, loopback modes are supported for all speeds \n(10/100/1000) and all MAC interfaces (RGMII  and GMII ).\nMAC\nMII\nLoopbackMII\nPCS\nSignal\nProcessing\nAFE\nTransformer\nRJ-45\n12345678\nDigital\nLoopbackPCS\nLoopbackAnalog\nLoopback\nExternal\nLoopbackReverse\nLoopback\nFigure 8-11.

The point at which the signal is looped back is selected using loopback control bits with several \noptions being provided.\nWhen configuring loopback modes, the Loopback Configuration Register (LOOPCR), address 0x00FE, should \nbe set to 0xE720.\nTo maintain the desired operating mode, Auto-Negotiation should be disabled before selecting the Near-End \nLoopback mode. This constraint does not apply for external-loopback mode.\nAuto-MDIX should be disabled before selecting the Near-End Loopback mode. MDI or MDIX configuration \nshould be manually configured.\n8.4.4.1.1 MII Loopback\nMII Loopback is the shallowest loop through the PHY. It is a useful test mode to validate communications \nbetween the MAC and the PHY. While in MII Loopback mode the data is looped back, and can also be \nconfigured through register to transmit onto the media.\n8.4.4.1.2 PCS Loopback\nPCS Loopback occurs in the PCS layer of the PHY. No signal processing is performed when using PCS \nLoopback.\n8.4.4.1.3 Digital Loopback\nDigital Loopback includes the entire digital transmit – receive path. Data is looped back prior to the analog \ncircuitry.\n8.4.4.1.4 Analog Loopback\nAnalog Loopback includes the entire analog transmit-receive path.\n8.4.4.2 External Loopback\nWhen operating in 10BASE-Te or 100Base-T mode, signals can be looped back at the RJ-45 connector by \nwiring the transmit pins to the receive pins. Due to the nature of the signaling in 1000Base-T mode, this \ntype of external loopback is not supported. Analog loopback provides a way to loop data back in the analog \ncircuitry when operating in 1000Base-T mode. For proper operation in Analog Loopback mode, attach 100- Ω \nterminations to the RJ45 connector.\n8.4.4.3 Far-End (Reverse) Loopback\nFar-end (Reverse) Loopback is a special test mode to allow testing the PHY from the link-partner side. In this \nmode, data that is received from the link partner passes through the PHY\'s receiver, is looped back at the MAC \ninterface and is transmitted back to the link partner. While in Reverse Loopback mode, all data signals that come \nfrom the MAC are ignored. Through register configuration, data can also be transmitted onto the MAC Interface.www.ti.comDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 47\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\n8.4.5 BIST Configuration\nThe device incorporates an internal PRBS Built-in Self Test (BIST) circuit to accommodate in-circuit testing or \ndiagnostics. The BIST circuit can be used to test the integrity of the transmit and receive data paths. The BIST \ncan be performed using both internal loopback (digital or analog) or external loopback using a cable fixture. The \nBIST simulates pseudo-random data transfer scenarios in format of real packets and Inter-Packet Gap (IPG) on \nthe lines.\nThe BIST is implemented with independent transmit and receive paths, with the transmit block generating a \ncontinuous stream of a pseudo-random sequence. The device generates a 15-bit pseudo-random sequence for \nthe BIST. The received data is compared to the generated pseudo-random data by the BIST Linear Feedback \nShift Register (LFSR) to determine the BIST pass or fail status. The number of error bytes that the PRBS \nchecker received is stored in the BICSR2 register (0x0072). The status of whether the PRBS checker is locked \nto the incoming receive bit stream, whether the PRBS has lost sync, and whether the packet generator is busy, \ncan be read from the STS2 register (0x0017h). While the lock and sync indications are required to identify the \nbeginning of proper data reception, for any link failures or data corruption, the best indication is the contents of \nthe error counter in the BICSR2 register (0x0072). The number of received bytes are stored in BICSR1 (0x0071).\nThe PRBS test can be put in a continuous mode by using bit 14 of the BISCR register (0x0016h). In continuous \nmode, when one of the PRBS counters reaches the maximum value, the counter starts counting from zero \nagain. Packet transmission can be configured for one of two types, 64 and 1518 bytes, through register bit 13 of \nthe BISCR register (0x0016).\n8.4.6 Cable Diagnostics\nWith the vast deployment of Ethernet devices, the need for reliable, comprehensive and user-friendly cable \ndiagnostic tool is more important than ever. The wide variety of cables, topologies, and connectors deployed \nresults in the need to non-intrusively identify and report cable faults. The TI cable-diagnostic unit provides \nextensive information about cable integrity. The DP83867  offers, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) capability in \nits Cable Diagnostic tools kit.\n8.4.6.1 TDR\nThe DP83867  uses Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) to determine the quality of the cables, connectors, and \nterminations in addition to estimating the cable length. Some of the possible problems that can be diagnosed \ninclude opens, shorts, cable impedance mismatch, bad connectors, termination mismatches, cross faults, cross \nshorts, and any other discontinuities along the cable.\nThe DP83867  transmits a test pulse of known amplitude (1 V or 2.5 V) down each of the two pairs of an attached \ncable. The transmitted signal continues down the cable and reflects from each cable imperfection, fault, bad \nconnector, and from the end of the cable itself. After the pulse transmission, the DP83867  measures the return \ntime and amplitude of all these reflected pulses. This technique enables measuring the distance and magnitude \n(impedance) of non-terminated cables (open or short), discontinuities (bad connectors), improperly-terminated \ncables, and crossed pairs wires with ±1-m accuracy.\nThe DP83867  also uses data averaging to reduce noise and improve accuracy. The DP83867  can record up to \nfive reflections within the tested pair. If more than 5 reflections are recorded, the DP83867  saves the first 5 of \nthem. If a cross fault is detected, the TDR saves the first location of the cross fault and up to 4 reflections in the \ntested channel. The DP83867  TDR can measure cables beyond 100 m in length.\nFor all TDR measurements, the transformation between time of arrival and physical distance is done by the \nexternal host using minor computations (such as multiplication, addition, and lookup tables). The host must know \nthe expected propagation delay of the cable, which depends, among other things, on the cable category (for \nexample, CAT5, CAT5e, or CAT6).\nTDR measurement is allowed in the DP83867  in the following scenarios:\n•While Link partner is disconnected – cable is unplugged at the other side\n•Link partner is connected but remains quiet  (for example, in power-down mode)\n•TDR could be automatically activated when the link fails or is dropped by setting bit 7 of register 0x0009 \n(CFG1). The results of the TDR run after the link fails are saved in the TDR registers.DP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n48 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nSoftware could read these registers at any time to apply post processing on the TDR results. This mode is \ndesigned for cases when the link dropped due to cable disconnections; after link failure, for instance, the line is \nquiet to allow a proper function of the TDR.\n8.4.6.2 Energy Detect\nThe energy-detector module provides signal-strength indication in various scenarios. Because it is based on an \nIIR filter, this robust energy detector has excellent reaction time and reliability. The filter output is compared \nto predefined thresholds to decide the presence or absence of an incoming signal. The energy detector \nalso implements hysteresis to avoid jittering in signal-detect indication. Additionally, it has fully-programmable \nthresholds and listening-time periods, enabling shortening of the reaction time if required.\n8.4.6.3 Fast Link Detect\nSeveral advanced modes are available for fast link establishment. Unlike the Auto-Negotiation and Auto-MDIX \nmechanisms defined by the IEEE 802.3 specification, these modes are specific to the DP83867 . Take care when \nimplementing these modes. For best operation, TI recommends implementing these modes with a DP83867  on \nboth ends of the link.\nThese advanced link and crossover modes depend on the speed selected for the link. Some modes are intended \nfor use in 1000Base-T operation. Others are intended for use in 100Base-TX operation.\nFast Link Detect functionality can be configured using the Configuration Register 3 (CFG3), address 0x001E.\n8.4.6.4 Speed Optimization\nSpeed optimization, also known as link downshift, enables fallback to 100-M operation after multiple consecutive \nfailed attempts at Gigabit link establishment. Such a case could occur if cabling with only four wires (two twisted \npairs) were connected instead of the standard cabling with eight wires (four twisted pairs).\nThe number of failed link attempts before falling back to 100-M operation is configurable. By default, four failed \nlink attempts are required before falling back to 100 M.\nIn enhanced mode, fallback to 100 M can occur after one failed link attempt if energy is not detected on the C \nand D channels. Speed optimization also supports fallback to 10 M if link establishment fails in Gigabit and in \n100-M mode.\nSpeed optimization can be enabled via strap or  through register configuration.\n8.4.6.5 Mirror Mode\nIn some multiport applications, RJ-45 ports may be mirrored relative to one another. This mirroring can require \ncrossing board traces. The DP83867  can resolve this issue by implementing mirroring of the ports inside the \ndevice.\nIn 10/100 operation, the mapping of the port mirroring is:\nMDI MODE MIRROR PORT CONFIGURATION\nMDI A → D\nB → C\nMDIX A → D\nB → C\nIn Gigabit operation, the mapping of the port mirroring is:\nMDI MODE MIRROR PORT CONFIGURATION\nMDI or MDIX A → D\nB → C\nC → B\nD → Awww.ti.comDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 49\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nMirror mode can be enabled through strap or through register configuration using the Port Mirror Enable bit in \nthe CFG4 register (address 0x0031). In Mirror mode, the polarity of the signals is also reversed.\n8.4.6.6 Interrupt\nThe DP83867  can be configured to generate an interrupt when changes of internal status occur. The interrupt \nallows a MAC to act upon the status in the PHY without polling the PHY registers. The interrupt source can be \nselected through the interrupt registers, MICR (register address 0x0012) and ISR (register address 0x0013).\n8.4.6.7 IEEE 802.3 Test Modes\nIEEE 802.3 specification for 1000BASE-T requires that the PHY layer be able to generate certain well defined \ntest patterns on TX outputs. Clause 40 section 40.6.1.1.2 Test Modes  describes these tests in detail. There are \nfour test modes as well as the normal operation mode. These modes can be selected by writing to the CFG1 \nregister (address 0x0009).\nSee IEEE 802.3 section 40.6.1.1.2 Test modes  for more information on the nature of the test modes. The \nDP83867  provides a test clock synchronous to the IEEE test patterns. The test patterns are output on the MDI \npins of the device and the transmit clock is output on the CLK_OUT pin.\nFor more information about configuring the DP83867  for IEEE 802.3 compliance testing, see the How to \nConfigure DP838XX for Ethernet Compliance Testing  application report (SNLS239).DP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n50 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\n8.5 Programming\n8.5.1 Strap Configuration\nThe DP83867  uses many of the functional pins as strap options to place the device into specific modes \nof operation. The values of these pins are sampled at power up or hard reset. During software resets, the \nstrap options are internally reloaded from the values sampled at power up or hard reset. The strap option pin \nassignments are defined below. The functional pin name is indicated in parentheses.\nThe strap pins supported are 4-level straps, which are described in greater detail below.\nNote\nBecause strap pins may have alternate functions after reset is deasserted, they should not be \nconnected directly to VDD or GND.\nConfiguration of the device may be done through the 4-level strap pins or through the management register \ninterface. A pullup resistor and a pulldown resistor of suggested values may be used to set the voltage ratio of \nthe 4-level strap pin input and the supply to select one of the possible selected modes.\nThe MAC interface pins must support I/O voltages of 3.3 V, 2.5 V, and 1.8 V. As the strap inputs are implemented \non these pins, the straps must also support operation at 3.3-V, 2.5-V, and 1.8-V supplies.\nFor more information about configuring 4-level straps, see the Configuring Ethernet Devices with 4-Level Straps \napplication report (SNLA258).\nRhi\nRlo9k\r\x03\n±25%VDDIO\nV STRAPDP83867\nFigure 8-12.

Several functions can be multiplexed onto the LEDs for different modes of operation. The LED operation \nmode can be selected using the LEDCR1 register (address 0x0018).\nBecause the LED output pins are also used as straps, the external components required for strapping and \nLED usage must be considered to avoid contention. Specifically, when the LED outputs are used to drive LEDs \ndirectly, the active state of each output driver is dependent on the logic level sampled by the corresponding AN \ninput upon power up or reset.\nIf a given strap input is resistively pulled low then the corresponding output is configured as an active high \ndriver. In the context of the 4-level straps, this occurs for modes 1, 2, and 3. Conversely, if a given strap input is \nresistively pulled high, then the corresponding output is configured as an active low driver. In the context of the \n4-level straps, this occurs only for mode 4.\nRefer to Figure 8-13  for an example of strap connections to external components. In this example, the strapping \nresults in Mode 1 for LED_0 and Mode 4 for LED_1.\nThe adaptive nature of the LED outputs helps to simplify potential implementation issues of these dual purpose \npins.DP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n54 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nVDD\n2.49 N\x9f\x03\n470\x9f\x03 470\x9f\x03\nGND\nLED\n_0LED\n_1\nMode 4 Mode 1Figure 8-13.

RGZ PHY Address Strapping Example\n8.5.5 Reset Operation\nThe DP83867  includes an internal power-on-reset (POR) function and therefore does not need to be explicitly \nreset for normal operation after power up. If required during normal operation, the device can be reset by a \nhardware or software reset.\n8.5.5.1 Hardware Reset\nA hardware reset is accomplished by applying a low pulse, with a duration of at least 1 μs, to the RESET_N pin. \nThis resets the device such that all registers are reinitialized to default values and the hardware configuration \nvalues are re-latched into the device (similar to the power up or reset operation).\n8.5.5.2 IEEE Software Reset\nAn IEEE registers software reset is accomplished by setting the reset bit (bit 15) of the BMCR register (address \n0x0000). This bit resets the IEEE-defined standard registers.\n8.5.5.3 Global Software Reset\nA global software reset is accomplished by setting bit 15 of register CTRL (address 0x001F) to 1. This bit resets \nall the internal circuits in the PHY including IEEE-defined registers and all the extended registers. The global \nsoftware reset resets the device such that all registers are reset to default values and the hardware configuration \nvalues are maintained.\n8.5.5.4 Global Software Restart\nA global software restart is accomplished by setting bit 14 of register CTRL (0x001F) to 1. This action resets all \nthe PHY circuits except the registers in the Register File.\n8.5.6 Power-Saving Modes\nDP83867  supports 4 power saving modes. The details are provided below.www.ti.comDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 57\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\n8.5.6.1 IEEE Power Down\nThe PHY is powered down but access to the PHY through MDIO-MDC pins is retained. This mode can be \nactivated by asserting external PWDN pin or by setting bit 11 of BMCR (Register 0x00).\nThe PHY can be taken out of this mode by a power cycle, software reset, or by clearing the bit 11 in BMCR \nregister. However, the external PWDN pin should be deasserted. If the PWDN pin is kept asserted then the PHY \nremains in power down.\n8.5.6.2 Deep Power-Down Mode\nThis same as IEEE power down but the XI pad is also turned off. This mode can be activated by asserting the \nexternal PWDN pin or by setting bit 11 of BMCR (Register 0x00). Before activating this mode, it is required to set \nbit 7 for PHYCR (Register 0x10).\nThe PHY can be taken out of this mode by a power cycle, software reset or by clearing the bit 11 in BMCR \nregister. However, the external PWDN pin should be de-asserted. If the PWDN pin is kept asserted then the PHY \nremains in power down.\n8.5.6.3 Active Sleep\nIn this mode, all the digital and analog blocks are powered down. The PHY is automatically powered up when a \nlink partner is detected. This mode is useful for saving power when the link partner is down or inactive, but PHY \ncannot be powered down. In Active Sleep mode, the PHY still routinely sends NLP to the link partner. This mode \ncan be active by writing binary 10 to bits [9:8] for PHYCR (Register 0x10).\n8.5.6.4 Passive Sleep\nThis is just like Active sleep except the PHY does not send NLP. This mode can be activated by writing binary 11 \nto bits [9:8] PHYCR (Register 0x10).DP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n58 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\n8.6 Register Maps\nIn the register definitions under the ‘Default’ heading, the following definitions hold true:\nRW Read Write access\nSC Register sets on event occurrence and Self-Clears when event ends\nRW/SC ReadWrite access/Self Clearing bit\nRO Read Only access\nCOR COR = Clear On Read\nRO/COR Read Only, Clear On Read\nRO/P Read Only, Permanently set to a default value\nLL Latched Low and held until read, based upon the occurrence of the corresponding event\nLH Latched High and held until read, based upon the occurrence of the corresponding event\nStrap Default value loaded from bootstrap pin after reset\n8.6.1 Basic Mode Control Register (BMCR)\nTable 8-9.

Instead, make chassis ground \nan isolated island and make a void between the chassis and circuit ground.

Traces must be kept short as possible. \nUnless mentioned otherwise, all signal traces should be 50- Ω, single-ended impedance. Differential traces \nshould be 50- Ω, single-ended and 100- Ω differential. Take care that the impedance is constant throughout. \nImpedance discontinuities cause reflections leading to EMI & signal integrity problems. Stubs must be avoided \non all signal traces, especially the differential signal pairs. See Figure 11-1\nWithin the differential pairs, the trace lengths must run parallel to each other and matched in length. Matched \nlengths minimize delay differences, avoiding an increase in common-mode noise and increased EMI.\nLength matching is also important on MAC interface. All Transmit signal trace lengths must match to each other \nand all Receive signal trace lengths must match to each other.\nIdeally, there should be no crossover or via on the signal paths. Vias present impedance discontinuities and \nshould be minimized. Route an entire trace pair on a single layer if possible.\nFigure 11-1. Avoiding Stubs in a Differential Signal Pair\nSignals on different layers should not cross each other without at least one return path plane between them.\nCoupling between traces is also an important factor. Unwanted coupling can cause cross talk problems. \nDifferential pairs on the other hand, should have a constant coupling distance between them.\nFor convenience and efficient layout process, start by routing the critical signals first.\n11.1.2 Return Path\nA general best practice is to have a solid return path beneath all signal traces. This return path can be a \ncontinuous ground or DC power plane. Reducing the width of the return path width can potentially affect the \nimpedance of the signal trace. This effect is more prominent when the width of the return path is comparable \nto the width of the signal trace. Breaks in return path beneath the signal traces should be avoided at all cost. A \nsignal crossing a plane split may cause unpredictable return path currents and would likely impact signal quality \nas well, potentially creating EMI problems. See Figure 11-2DP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022 www.ti.com\n128 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nFigure 11-2. Differential Signal Pair-Plane Crossing\n11.1.3 Transformer Layout\nThere should be no metal layer running beneath the transformer. Transformers can inject noise in metal beneath \nthem which can affect the performance of the system.\n11.1.4 Metal Pour\nAll metal pours which are not signals or power should be tied to ground. There should be no floating metal on the \nsystem. There should be no metal between the differential traces.\n11.1.5 PCB Layer Stacking\nTo meet signal integrity and performance requirements, at minimum a 4-layer PCB should be used. However \na 6-layer board is recommended. See Figure 11-3  for the recommended layer stack ups for 4, 6 and 8-layer \nboards. These are recommendations not requirements, other configurations can be used as per system \nrequirements.\nFigure 11-3. Recommended Layer Stack Up\nWithin a PCB, it may be desirable to run traces using different methods, microstrip vs. stripline, depending on the \nlocation of the signal on the PCB. For example, it may be desirable to change layer stacking where an isolated \nchassis ground plane is used. Figure 11-4  illustrates alternative PCB stacking options.www.ti.comDP83867IR, DP83867CR\nSNLS484G – FEBRUARY 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 129\nProduct Folder Links: DP83867IR  DP83867CR\nFigure 11-4.
