Thememory is organized as 16 pages of 256 bits each. Avolatile 256-bit memory page called the scratchpadacts as a buffer when writing data to the EEPROM toensure data integrity. Data is first written to the scratch-pad, from which it can be read back for verificationbefore transferring it to the EEPROM. The operation ofthe DS24B33 is controlled over the single-conductor1-Wire bus. Device communication follows the standard1-Wire protocol. The energy required to read and writethe DS24B33 is derived entirely from the 1-Wire com-munication line. Each DS24B33 has its own unalterableand unique 64-bit registration number. The registrationnumber guarantees unique identification and is used toaddress the device in a multidrop 1-Wire net environ-ment. Multiple DS24B33 devices can reside on a com-mon 1-Wire bus and be operated independently ofeach other. Applications of the DS24B33 include cali-bration data storage, PCB identification, and storage ofproduct revision status. The DS24B33 provides a highdegree of backward compatibility with the DS2433,including having the same family code.\nOverview\nFigure 1 shows the relationships between the majorcontrol and memory sections of the DS24B33.

The bus master must first provideone of the seven ROM (network) function commands:Read ROM, Match ROM, Search ROM, Skip ROM,Resume, Overdrive-Skip ROM, or Overdrive-MatchROM. Upon completion of an overdrive ROM com-mand byte executed at standard speed, the deviceenters overdrive mode where all subsequent commu-nication occurs at a higher speed. Figure 9describes the protocol required for these ROM func-tion commands. After a ROM function command issuccessfully executed, the memory functionsbecome accessible and the master can provide anyone of the four memory function commands. Figure 7describes the protocol for these commands. All datais read and written least significant bit (LSB) first.Parasite Power\nFigure 1 shows the parasite power supply. This circuitry“steals” power whenever the IO input is high. IO pro-vides sufficient power as long as the specified timingand voltage requirements are met.\n64-Bit Registration Number\nEach DS24B33 contains a unique registration numberthat is 64 bits long. The first 8 bits are a 1-Wire familycode. The next 48 bits are a unique serial number. Thelast 8 bits are a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of thefirst 56 bits. See Figure 3 for details. The 1-Wire CRC isgenerated using a polynomial generator consisting of ashift register and XOR gates as shown in Figure 4. Thepolynomial is X\n8 + X5 + X4 + 1.

After the 8th bit of the family code has beenentered, the serial number is entered. After the last bitof the serial number has been entered, the shift registercontains the CRC value. Shifting in the 8 bits of theCRC returns the shift register to all 0s.Memory\nThe DS24B33 EEPROM array (Figure 5) consists of 16pages of 32 bytes each, starting at address 0000h andending at address 01FFh. In addition to the EEPROM,the device has a 32-byte volatile scratchpad. Writes tothe EEPROM array are a two-step process. First, datais written to the scratchpad and then copied into themain array. The user can verify the data in the scratch-pad prior to copying.\nMaxim Integrated\n7\nDS24B33\n1-Wire 4Kb EEPROM\nMemory Access\nAddress Registers and Transfer Status\nThe DS24B33 employs three address registers: TA1,\nTA2, and E/S (Figure 6). Registers TA1 and TA2 mustbe loaded with the target address to which the data iswritten or from which data is read. Register E/S is aread-only transfer status register used to verify dataintegrity with write commands. ES bits E[4:0] areloaded with the incoming T[4:0] on a Write Scratchpadcommand and increment on each subsequent databyte. This is, in effect, a byte-ending offset counterwithin the 32-byte scratchpad. Bit 5 of the E/S register,called the partial byte flag (PF), is set if the number ofdata bits sent by the master is not an integer multiple of8 or if the data in the scratchpad is not valid due to aloss of power. A valid write to the scratchpad clears thePF bit. Bit 6 has no function; it always reads 0. Thehighest valued bit of the E/S register, called authoriza-tion accepted (AA), is valid only if the PF flag reads 0. IfPF is 0 and AA is 1, the data stored in the scratchpadhas already been copied to the target memory address.Writing data to the scratchpad clears this flag.\nWriting with Verification\nTo write data to the DS24B33, the scratchpad must beused as intermediate storage. First, the master issuesthe Write Scratchpad command to specify the desiredtarget address, followed by the data to be written to thescratchpad. Under certain conditions (see the \nWriteScratchpad [0Fh] section) the master receives an\ninverted CRC-16 of the command, address, and data atthe end of the Write Scratchpad command sequence.Knowing this CRC value, the master can compare it tothe value it has calculated itself to decide if the commu-nication was successful and proceed to the CopyScratchpad command. If the master could not receivethe CRC-16, it should send the Read Scratchpad com-mand to verify data integrity. As a preamble to thescratchpad data, the DS24B33 repeats the targetaddress TA1 and TA2 and sends the contents of theE/S register. If the PF flag is set, data did not arrive cor-rectly in the scratchpad or there was a loss of powersince data was last written to the scratchpad. The mas-ter does not need to continue reading; it can start anew trial to write data to the scratchpad. Similarly, a setAA flag together with a cleared PF flag indicates thatthe device did not recognize the write command. Ifeverything went correctly, both flags are cleared andthe ending offset indicates the address of the last bytewritten to the scratchpad. Now the master can continuereading and verifying every data byte. After the masterhas verified the data, it can send the Copy Scratchpadcommand, for example. This command must be fol-lowed exactly by the data of the three address registersTA1, TA2, and E/S. The master should obtain the con-tents of these registers by reading the scratchpad. Assoon as the DS24B33 has received these bytes correctly,it starts copying the scratchpad data to the requestedlocation.\nBIT NUMBER 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\nTARGET ADDRESS (TA1) T7 T6 T5 T4 T3 T2 T1 T0 \nTARGET ADDRESS (TA2) T15 T14 T13 T12 T11 T10 T9 T8 \nENDING ADDRESS WITH \nDATA STATUS (E/S) \n(READ ONLY) AA 0 PF E4 E3 E2 E1 E0 \nFigure 6. Address Registers\n8\nMaxim Integrated\nDS24B33\n1-Wire 4Kb EEPROM\nMemory Function Commands\nThe Memory Function Flowchart (Figure 7) describes\nthe protocols necessary for accessing the memory of\nthe DS24B33. The target address registers TA1 andTA2 are used for both read and write. The communica-tion between the master and the DS24B33 takes placeeither at standard speed (default, OD = 0) or at over-drive speed (OD = 1). If not explicitly set into the over-drive mode, the DS24B33 assumes standard speed.\nWrite Scratchpad [0Fh]\nThe Write Scratchpad command applies to the datamemory. After issuing the Write Scratchpad command,the master must first provide the 2-byte target address,followed by the data to be written to the scratchpad.The data is written to the scratchpad starting at the byteoffset of T[4:0]. The ES bits E[4:0] are loaded with thestarting byte offset and increment with each subse-quent byte. Effectively, E[4:0] is the byte offset of thelast full byte written to the scratchpad. Only full bytesare accepted. If the last byte is incomplete, its contentis ignored and PF is set.\nWhen executing the Write Scratchpad command, the\nCRC generator inside the DS24B33 (Figure 13) calcu-lates a 16-bit CRC of the entire data stream, starting atthe command code and ending at the last data byte assent by the master. This CRC is generated using theCRC-16 polynomial (X\n16 + X15 + X2 + 1) by first clear-\ning the CRC generator and then shifting in the com-mand code (0Fh) of the Write Scratchpad command,the target addresses TA1 and TA2 as supplied by themaster, and all the data bytes. The master can end theWrite Scratchpad command at any time. However, if theend of the scratchpad is reached (E[4:0] = 11111b),the master can send 16 read time slots to receive theCRC generated by the DS24B33.\nThe DS24B33’s memory address range is 0000h to\n01FFh. If the bus master sends a target address higherthan this, the DS24B33’s internal circuitry sets the 7most significant address bits to zero as they are shiftedinto the internal address register. The Read Scratchpadcommand reveals the modified target address. Themaster identifies such address modifications by com-paring the target address read back to the targetaddress transmitted. If the master does not read thescratchpad, a subsequent Copy Scratchpad commanddoes not work because the most significant bits of thetarget address the master sends do not match thevalue that the DS24B33 expects.Read Scratchpad [AAh]\nThe Read Scratchpad command allows for verifying thetarget address and the integrity of the scratchpad data.After issuing the command code, the master beginsreading. The first 2 bytes are the target address. Thenext byte is the ending offset/data status byte (E/S) fol-lowed by the scratchpad data beginning at the byte off-set (T[4:0]). The master should read through the end ofthe scratchpad. If the master continues reading beyondthe end of the scratchpad, all data are logic 1s.\nCopy Scratchpad [55h]\nThe Copy Scratchpad command is used to copy datafrom the scratchpad to the data memory. After issuingthe Copy Scratchpad command, the master must pro-vide a 3-byte authorization pattern, which should havebeen obtained by an immediately preceding ReadScratchpad command. This 3-byte pattern must exactlymatch the data contained in the three address registers(TA1, TA2, E/S, in that order). If the pattern matchesand the target address is valid, the AA flag is set andthe copy begins. The data to be copied is determinedby the three address registers. The scratchpad datafrom the beginning offset through the ending offset iscopied to memory, starting at the target address.Anywhere from 1 to 32 bytes can be copied with thiscommand. The duration of the device’s internal datatransfer is t\nPROG , during which the voltage on the\n1-Wire bus must not fall below V PUPMIN . A pattern of\nalternating 0s and 1s are transmitted after the data hasbeen copied until the master issues a reset pulse.\nNote: Because of the memory architecture of the\nDS24B33, if a Copy Scratchpad command is interrupted\nduring the write cycle, two consecutive Copy\nScratchpad commands of the same data to the samelocation may be necessary to recover. To verify the suc-cess of the Copy Scratchpad command, always look forthe alternating 0-to-1 pattern at the end of the CopyScratchpad command flow and also read back the EEP-ROM page that was to be updated. If the alternatingpattern appeared and the EEPROM page data showsthe intended new data, the write access was successful.No further action is required. In all other cases (alternat-ing 0-to-1 pattern is not seen or nonmatching EEPROMpage data), repeat the Write Scratchpad, CopyScratchpad sequence until successful.\nMaxim Integrated\n9\nDS24B33\n1-Wire 4Kb EEPROM\nBUS MASTER Tx MEMORY\nFUNCTION COMMAND\nDS24B33 CLEARS PF, AA\nMASTER Tx DATA BYTE\nTO SCRATCHPAD OFFSETDS24B33 SETS SCRATCHPAD\nOFFSET = (T[4:0])DS24B33 SETS SCRATCHPAD\nOFFSET = (T[4:0])\nBUS MASTER\nRx "1"sDS24B33\nINCREMENTS\nSCRATCHPAD\nOFFSET\nPF = 1BUS MASTER Tx EEPROM\nARRAY TARGET ADDRESS\nTA1 (T[7:0]), TA2 (T[15:8])BUS MASTER Rx\nTA1 (T[7:0]), TA2 (T[15:8]),\nAND E/S BYTE0Fh\nWRITE SCRATCHPAD?N\nY\nNY\nN\nY\nYNNMASTER Tx RESET?\nPARTIAL BYTE?\nSCRATCHPAD OFFSET\n= 11111b?\nMASTER Tx RESET?DS24B33 SETS (E[4:0]) =\nSCRATCHPAD OFFSET\nDS24B33 Tx CRC-16 OF\nCOMMAND, ADDRESS,\nAND DATA BYTES AS THEY\nWERE SENT BY THE BUS\nMASTER\nBUS MASTER\nRx "1"s\nYNMASTER Tx RESET?Y\nNMASTER Tx RESET?\nYSCRATCHPAD OFFSET\n= 11111b?\nYFROM ROM FUNCTIONS\nFLOWCHART (FIGURE 9)\nTO ROM FUNCTIONS\nFLOWCHART (FIGURE 9)AAh\nREAD SCRATCHPAD?N\nY\nNBUS MASTER Rx DATA BYTE\nTO SCRATCHPAD OFFSET\nDS24B33\nINCREMENTS\nSCRATCHPAD\nOFFSETTO FIGURE 7b\nFROM FIGURE 7b\nFigure 7a.

After issuing the command,the master must provide a 2-byte target address, whichshould be in the range of 0000h to 01FFh. If the targetaddress is higher than 01FFh, the DS24B33 changesthe upper 7 address bits to 0. After the address istransmitted, the master reads data starting at the (modi-fied) target address and can continue until address01FFh. If the master continues reading, the result isFFh. The Read Memory command can be ended at anypoint by issuing a reset pulse. Note that the (modified)target address provided with the Read Memory com-mand overwrites the target address that was specifiedwith a previously issued Write Scratchpad command.The Read Memory command overwrites the scratchpadwith data from the target memory page. When readingthe last byte of a memory page, the scratchpad isloaded with data from the next memory page. Thiscould cause unexpected data to be loaded into thescratchpad.1-Wire Bus System\nThe 1-Wire bus is a system that has a single bus masterand one or more slaves. In all instances the DS24B33 isa slave device. The bus master is typically a microcon-troller. The discussion of this bus system is brokendown into three topics: hardware configuration, trans-action sequence, and 1-Wire signaling (signal typesand timing). The 1-Wire protocol defines bus transac-tions in terms of the bus state during specific time slots,which are initiated on the falling edge of sync pulsesfrom the bus master.\nHardware Configuration\nThe 1-Wire bus has only a single line by definition; it isimportant that each device on the bus be able to driveit at the appropriate time. To facilitate this, each deviceattached to the 1-Wire bus must have open-drain orthree-state outputs. The 1-Wire port of the DS24B33 isopen drain with an internal circuit equivalent to thatshown in Figure 8.\nRxRPUP\nILVPUP\nBUS MASTER\nOPEN-DRAIN\nPORT PIN100Ω MOSFETTxRx\nTxDATADS24B33 1-Wire PORT\nRx = RECEIVE\nTx = TRANSMIT\nFigure 8. Hardware Configuration\n12\nMaxim Integrated\nDS24B33\n1-Wire 4Kb EEPROM\nA multidrop bus consists of a 1-Wire bus with multiple\nslaves attached. The DS24B33 supports both a stan-dard and overdrive communication speed of 15.4kbps(maximum) and 125kbps (maximum), respectively, overthe full pullup voltage range. For pullup voltages of+4.75V and higher, the DS24B33 also supports thelegacy communication speed of 16.3kbps and over-drive speed of 142kbps. The slightly reduced rates forthe DS24B33 are a result of additional recovery times,which in turn were driven by a 1-Wire physical interfaceenhancement to improve noise immunity. The value ofthe pullup resistor primarily depends on the networksize and load conditions. The DS24B33 requires apullup resistor of 2.2kΩ (maximum) at any speed.\nThe idle state for the 1-Wire bus is high. If for any rea-son a transaction must be suspended, the bus \nmust be\nleft in the idle state if the transaction is to resume. If thisdoes not occur and the bus is left low for more than16µs (overdrive speed) or more than 120µs (standardspeed), one or more devices on the bus may be reset.\nTransaction Sequence\nThe protocol for accessing the DS24B33 through the1-Wire port is as follows:\n• Initialization• ROM Function Commands• Memory Function Commands• Transaction/Data\nInitialization\nAll transactions on the 1-Wire bus begin with an initial-\nization sequence. The initialization sequence consistsof a reset pulse transmitted by the bus master followedby presence pulse(s) transmitted by the slave(s). Thepresence pulse lets the bus master know that theDS24B33 is on the bus and is ready to operate. Formore details, see the \n1-Wire Signaling section.\n1-Wire ROM Function Commands\nOnce the bus master has detected a presence, it canissue one of the seven ROM function commands thatthe DS24B33 supports. All ROM function commands are8 bits long. See Figure 9 for a list of these commands.Read ROM [33h]\nThis command allows the bus master to read theDS24B33’s 8-bit family code, unique 48-bit serial num-ber, and 8-bit CRC. This command can only be used ifthere is a single slave on the bus. If more than oneslave is present on the bus, a data collision occurswhen all slaves try to transmit at the same time (opendrain produces a wired-AND result). The resultant familycode and 48-bit serial number results in a mismatch ofthe CRC.\nMatch ROM [55h]\nThe Match ROM command, followed by a 64-bit ROMsequence, allows the bus master to address a specificDS24B33 on a multidrop bus. Only the DS24B33 thatexactly matches the 64-bit ROM sequence responds tothe memory function command that follows. All otherslaves wait for a reset pulse. This command can beused with a single device or multiple devices on thebus.\nSearch ROM [F0h]\nWhen a system is initially brought up, the bus mastermight not know the number of devices on the 1-Wirebus or their registration numbers. By taking advantageof the bus’s wired-AND property, the master can use aprocess of elimination to identify the registration num-bers of all slave devices. For each bit of the registrationnumber, starting with the LSB, the bus master issues atriplet of time slots. On the first slot, each slave deviceparticipating in the search outputs the true value of itsregistration number bit. On the second slot, each slavedevice participating in the search outputs the comple-mented value of its registration number bit. On the thirdslot, the master writes the true value of the bit to beselected. All slave devices that do not match the bitwritten by the master stop participating in the search. Ifboth of the read bits are zero, the master knows thatslave devices exist with both states of the bit. By choos-ing which state to write, the bus master branches in theROM code tree. After one complete pass, the bus mas-ter knows the registration number of a single device.Additional passes identify the registration numbers ofthe remaining devices. Refer to Application Note 187:\n1-Wire Search Algorithm for a detailed discussion and\nan example.\nMaxim Integrated\n13\nDS24B33\n1-Wire 4Kb EEPROM\nSkip ROM [CCh]\nThis command can save time in a single-drop bus sys-\ntem by allowing the bus master to access the memoryfunctions without providing the 64-bit ROM code. Ifmore than one slave is present on the bus and, forexample, a read command is issued following the SkipROM command, data collision occurs on the bus asmultiple slaves transmit simultaneously (open-drainpulldowns produce a wired-AND result).\nResume [A5h]\nTo maximize the data throughput in a multidrop envi-ronment, the Resume command is available. This com-mand checks the status of the RC bit and, if it is set,directly transfers control to the memory functions, simi-lar to a Skip ROM command. The only way to set theRC bit is by successfully executing the Match ROM,Search ROM, or Overdrive-Match ROM command.Once the RC bit is set, the device can repeatedly beaccessed through the Resume command. Accessinganother device on the bus clears the RC bit, preventingtwo or more devices from simultaneously responding tothe Resume command.\nOverdrive-Skip ROM [3Ch]\nOn a single-drop bus, this command can save time byallowing the bus master to access the memory func-tions without providing the 64-bit ROM code. Unlike thenormal Skip ROM command, the Overdrive-Skip ROMcommand sets the DS24B33 in the overdrive mode (OD= 1). All communication following this command mustoccur at overdrive speed until a reset pulse of minimum480µs duration resets all devices on the bus to stan-dard speed (OD = 0).When issued on a multidrop bus, this command sets alloverdrive-supporting devices into overdrive mode. Tosubsequently address a specific overdrive-supportingdevice, a reset pulse at overdrive speed must beissued followed by a Match ROM or Search ROM com-mand sequence. This speeds up the time for thesearch process. If more than one slave supportingoverdrive is present on the bus and the Overdrive-SkipROM command is followed by a Read command, datacollision occurs on the bus as multiple slaves transmitsimultaneously (open-drain pulldowns produce a wired-AND result).\nOverdrive-Match ROM [69h]\nThe Overdrive-Match ROM command followed by a 64-bit ROM sequence transmitted at overdrive speedallows the bus master to address a specific DS24B33on a multidrop bus and to simultaneously set it in over-drive mode. Only the DS24B33 that exactly matchesthe 64-bit ROM sequence responds to the subsequentmemory function command. Slaves already in overdrivemode from a previous Overdrive-Skip ROM or success-ful Overdrive-Match ROM command remain in over-drive mode. All overdrive-capable slaves return tostandard speed at the next reset pulse of minimum480µs duration. The Overdrive-Match ROM commandcan be used with a single device or multiple devices onthe bus.\n14\nMaxim Integrated\nDS24B33\n1-Wire 4Kb EEPROM\nDS24B33 Tx\nPRESENCE PULSEBUS MASTER Tx\nRESET PULSE\nBUS MASTER Tx ROM\nFUNCTION COMMAND\nDS24B33 Tx\nCRC BYTEDS24B33Tx\nFAMILY CODE\n(1 BYTE)\nDS24B33 Tx\nSERIAL NUMBER\n(6 BYTES)OD = 0\nRC = 0\nMASTER Tx BIT 0RC = 0 RC = 0OD\nRESET PULSE?\nY Y\nY\nY\nYYN\n33h\nREAD ROM\nCOMMAND?N55h\nMATCH ROM\nCOMMAND?\nBIT 0 MATCH?

ROM Functions Flowchart (continued)\n16\nMaxim Integrated\nDS24B33\n1-Wire 4Kb EEPROM\n1-Wire Signaling\nThe DS24B33 requires strict protocols to ensure data\nintegrity. The protocol consists of four types of signalingon one line: reset sequence with reset pulse and pres-ence pulse, write-zero, write-one, and read-data.Except for the presence pulse, the bus master initiatesall falling edges. The DS24B33 can communicate attwo different speeds: standard speed and overdrivespeed. If not explicitly set into the overdrive mode, theDS24B33 communicates at standard speed. While inoverdrive mode the fast timing applies to all waveforms.\nTo get from idle to active, the voltage on the 1-Wire line\nneeds to fall from V\nPUP below the threshold V TL. To get\nfrom active to idle, the voltage needs to rise from V\nILMAX past the threshold V TH. The time it takes for the\nvoltage to make this rise is seen in Figure 10 as ε, andits duration depends on the pullup resistor (R\nPUP) used\nand the capacitance of the 1-Wire network attached.The voltage V\nILMAX is relevant for the DS24B33 when\ndetermining a logical level, not triggering any events.\nFigure 10 shows the initialization sequence required to\nbegin any communication with the DS24B33. A resetpulse followed by a presence pulse indicates that theDS24B33 is ready to receive data, given the correctROM and memory function command. If the bus masteruses slew-rate control on the falling edge, it must pulldown the line for t\nRSTL + tF to compensate for the edge.\nA tRSTL duration of 480µs or longer exits the overdrive\nmode, returning the device to standard speed. If theDS24B33 is in overdrive mode and t\nRSTL is no longer\nthan 80µs, the device remains in overdrive mode. If thedevice is in overdrive mode and t\nRSTL is between 80µs\nand 480µs, the device resets, but the communicationspeed is undetermined.After the bus master has released the line it goes intoreceive mode. Now the 1-Wire bus is pulled to V\nPUP\nthrough the pullup resistor, or in case of a DS2482-x00or DS2480B driver, by active circuitry. When the thresh-old V\nTH is crossed, the DS24B33 waits for t PDH and\nthen transmits a presence pulse by pulling the line lowfor t\nPDL. To detect a presence pulse, the master must\ntest the logical state of the 1-Wire line at t MSP.\nThe t RSTH window must be at least the sum of t PDHMAX ,\ntPDLMAX , and t RECMIN . Immediately after t RSTH is\nexpired, the DS24B33 is ready for data communication.In a mixed population network, t\nRSTH should be extend-\ned to minimum 480µs at standard speed and 48µs atoverdrive speed to accommodate other 1-Wire devices.\nRead/Write Time Slots\nData communication with the DS24B33 takes place intime slots, which carry a single bit each. Write time slotstransport data from bus master to slave. Read timeslots transfer data from slave to master. Figure 11 illus-trates the definitions of the write and read time slots.\nAll communication begins with the master pulling the\ndata line low. As the voltage on the 1-Wire line fallsbelow the threshold V\nTL, the DS24B33 starts its internal\ntiming generator that determines when the data line issampled during a write time slot and how long data isvalid during a read time slot.\nMaster-to-Slave\nFor a write-one time slot, the voltage on the data line\nmust have crossed the V TH threshold before the write-\none low time t W1LMAX is expired. For a write-zero time\nslot, the voltage on the data line must stay below theV\nTH threshold until the write-zero low time t W0LMIN is\nexpired.

During the t RL win-\ndow, when responding with a 0, the DS24B33 starts\npulling the data line low; its internal timing generatordetermines when this pulldown ends and the voltagestarts rising again. When responding with a 1, theDS24B33 does not hold the data line low at all, and thevoltage starts rising as soon as t\nRL is over.\nThe sum of t RL + δ(rise time) on one side and the inter-\nnal timing generator of the DS24B33 on the other sidedefine the master sampling window (t\nMSRMIN to\ntMSRMAX ) in which the master must perform a read from\nthe data line. For the most reliable communication, t RL\nshould be as short as permissible, and the mastershould read close to but no later than t\nMSRMAX . After\nreading from the data line, the master must wait untilt\nSLOT is expired. This guarantees sufficient recovery\ntime t REC for the DS24B33 to get ready for the next time\nslot. Note that t REC specified herein applies only to a\nsingle DS24B33 attached to a 1-Wire line. For multide-vice configurations, t\nREC needs to be extended to\naccommodate the additional 1-Wire device inputcapacitance. Alternatively, an interface that performsactive pullup during the 1-Wire recovery time such asthe DS2482-x00 or DS2480B 1-Wire line drivers can beused.\nImproved Network Behavior\n(Switchpoint Hysteresis)\nIn a 1-Wire environment, line termination is possibleonly during transients controlled by the bus master(1-Wire driver). 1-Wire networks, therefore, are suscep-tible to noise of various origins. Depending on the phys-ical size and topology of the network, reflections fromend points and branch points can add up or canceleach other to some extent. Such reflections are visibleas glitches or ringing on the 1-Wire communication line.Noise coupled onto the 1-Wire line from externalsources can also result in signal glitching. A glitch dur-ing the rising edge of a time slot can cause a slavedevice to lose synchronization with the master and,consequently, result in a Search ROM command com-ing to a dead end or cause a device-specific functioncommand to abort. For better performance in networkapplications, the DS24B33 uses an improved 1-Wirefront-end, which makes it less sensitive to noise.\nThe 1-Wire front-end of the DS24B33 differs from tradi-\ntional slave devices in one characteristic: There is a hys-teresis at the low-to-high switching threshold V\nTH. If a\nnegative glitch crosses V TH but does not go below\nVTH- VHY, it is not recognized (Figure 12). The hysteresis\nis effective at any 1-Wire speed.\nCRC Generation\nThe DS24B33 uses two different types of CRCs. OneCRC is an 8-bit type and is stored in the most signifi-cant byte of the 64-bit registration number. The busmaster can compute a CRC value from the first 56 bitsof the 64-bit registration number and compare it to thevalue stored within the DS24B33 to determine if the reg-istration number has been received error-free. Theequivalent polynomial function of this CRC is X\n8 + X5 +\nX4 + 1. This 8-bit CRC is received in the true (noninvert-\ned) form. It is computed and programmed into the chipat the factory.\nThe other CRC is a 16-bit type, generated according to\nthe standardized CRC-16 polynomial function X\n16 + X15\n+ X2 + 1. This CRC is used for fast verification of a data\ntransfer when writing to the scratchpad. In contrast tothe 8-bit CRC, the 16-bit CRC is always communicatedin the inverted form. A CRC generator inside theDS24B33 (Figure 13) calculates a new 16-bit CRC, asshown in the command flowchart (Figure 7). The busmaster compares the CRC value read from the deviceto the one it calculates from the data, and decideswhether to continue with an operation.\nWith the Write Scratchpad command, the CRC is gen-\nerated by first clearing the CRC generator and thenshifting in the command code, the target addressesTA1 and TA2, and all the data bytes as they were sentby the bus master. The DS24B33 transmits this CRConly if the data bytes written to the scratchpad includescratchpad ending offset 11111b. The data can start atany location within the scratchpad.\nFor more information on generating CRC values refer to\nApplication Note 27: \nUnderstanding and Using Cyclic\nRedundancy Checks with Maxim i Button Products .VPUP\nVTHVHY\n0V\nFigure 12.
