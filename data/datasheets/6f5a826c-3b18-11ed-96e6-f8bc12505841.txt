contains information pertaining to the Numonyx® Embedded Flash \nMemory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)  device features, operation, and \nspecifications.\nUnless otherwise indicated throughout the rest of this document, the Numonyx® \nEmbedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) device is referred to as \nJ3 65 nm SBC.\nThe J3 65 nm SBC device provides improved mainstream performance with enhanced \nsecurity features, taking advantage of the high quality and reliability of the NOR-based \n65 nm technology. Offered in 128-Mbit, 64-Mbit, and 32-Mbit densities, the J3 65 nm \nSBC device brings reliable, low-voltage capabi lity (3 V read, program, and erase) with \nhigh speed, low-power operation. The J3 65 nm SBC device takes advantage of proven \nmanufacturing experience and is ideal for code and data applications where high \ndensity and low cost are required, such as in networking, telecommunications, digital set top boxes, audio recording, and digital imaging. Numonyx Flash Memory \ncomponents also deliver a new generation of forward-compatible software support. By \nusing the Common Flash Interface (CFI) and Scalable Command Set (SCS), customers can take advantage of density upgrades and optimized write capabilities of future \nNumonyx Flash Memory devices.\n1.1 Nomenclature\nJ3 65 nm SBC Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \nAMINAll Densities AMIN = A0 for x8\nAll Densities AMIN = A1 for x16\nAMAX32 Mbit AMAX = A21\n64 Mbit AMAX = A22128 Mbit AMAX = A23\nBlock A group of flash cells that share common erase circuitry and erase simultaneously.\nClear Indicates a logic zero (0)\nProgram Writes data to the flash array\nSet Indicates a logic one (1)\nVPEN Refers to a signal or package connection name\nV\nPEN Refers to timing or voltage levels\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 7Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \n1.2 Acronyms\n1.3 Conventions\nh Hexadecimal Suffix\nK(noun) 1,000\nM (noun) 1,000,000\nNibble 4 bits\nByte 8 bits\nWord 16 bits\nKb 1,024 bits\nKB 1,024 bytes\nKW 1,024 words\nMb 1,048,576 bits\nMB 1,048,576 bytes\nMW 1,048,576 words\nKbit 1,024 bits\nMbit 1,048,576 bitsSBC Single Bit per Cell\nFDI Flash Data Integrator\nCFI Common Flash Interface\nSCS Scalable Command Set\nCUI Command User Interface\nOTP One Time Programmable\nPLR Protection Lock Register\nPR Protection Register\nPRD Protection Register Data\nRFU Reserved for Future Use\nSR Status Register\nSRD Status Register Data\nWSM Write State Machine\nECR Enhanced Configuration Register\nECD Enhanced Configuration Register Data\nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n8 208032-03Brackets  Square brackets ([]) will be used to designate group membership or to\ndefine a group of signals with similar function (i.e. A[21:1], SR[4,1]\nand D[15:0]).\n00FFh Denotes 16-bit hexadecimal numbers\n00FF 00FFh Denotes 32-bit hexadecimal numbers\nDQ[15:0] Data I/O signals\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 9Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \n2.0 Functional Overview\nThe J3 65 nm SBC family contains high-density memory organized in any of the \nfollowing configurations:\n• 16-MB or 8-MW (128-Mbit), organized as one-hundred-twenty-eight 128-KB erase \nblocks.\n• 8-MB or 4-MW (64-Mbit), organized as sixty-four 128-KB erase blocks. • 4-MB or 2-MW (32-Mbit), organized as thirty-two 128-KB erase blocks.\nThese devices can be accessed as 8- or 16-bit words. See Figure 1, “Memory Block \nDiagram for 32-, 64-, 128-Mbit” on page 11  for further details. \nA 128-bit Protection Register has multiple uses, including unique flash device \nidentification.\nThe J3 65 nm SBC device includes new security features that were not available on the \n(previous) 0.13µm versions of the J3 family. These new security features prevent \naltering of code through different protecti on schemes that can be implemented, based \non user requirements.\nThe J3 65 nm SBC optimized architecture and interface dramatically increases read \nperformance by supporting page-mode reads. This read mode is ideal for non-clock \nmemory systems.\nIts Common Flash Interface (CFI) permits software algorithms to be used for entire \nfamilies of devices. This allows device-independent, JEDEC ID-independent, and forward- and backward-compatible software  support for the specified flash device \nfamilies. Flash vendors can standardize their existing interfaces for long-term \ncompatibility.\nThe Scalable Command Set (SCS) allows a single, simple software driver in all host \nsystems to work with all SCS-compliant flash memory devices, independent of system-level packaging (e.g., memory card, SIMM, or  direct-to-board placement). Additionally, \nSCS provides the highest system/device data transfer rates and minimizes device and \nsystem-level implementation costs.\nA Command User Interface (CUI) serves as the interface between the system processor \nand internal operation of the device. A valid command sequence written to the CUI \ninitiates device automation. An internal Write State Machine (WSM) automatically executes the algorithms and timings necessary for block erase, program, and lock-bit \nconfiguration operations.\nA block erase operation erases one of the device’s 128-KB blocks typically within one \nsecond, independent of other blocks. Each block can be independently erased 100,000 \ntimes. Block erase suspend mode allows system software to suspend block erase to \nread or program data from any other block. Similarly, program suspend allows system software to suspend programming (byte/word program and write-to-buffer operations) \nto read data or execute code from any other block that is not being suspended.\nEach device incorporates a Write Buffer of 256-Byte (x8 mode) or 256-Word (x16 \nmode) to allow optimum programming performa nce. By using the Write Buffer data is \nprogrammed more efficiently in buffer increments.\nMemory Blocks are selectively and individually lockable in-system. Individual block \nlocking uses block lock-bits to lock and unlock blocks. Block lock-bits gate block erase \nand program operations. Lock-bit configuration operations set and clear lock-bits (using \nthe Set Block Lock-Bit and Clear Block Lock-Bits commands).\nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n10 208032-03The Status Register indicates when the WSM’s block erase, program, or lock-bit \nconfiguration operation completes.\nThe STS (status) output gives an additional indicator of WSM activity by providing both \na hardware signal of status (versus software polling) and status masking (interrupt masking for background block erase, for example). Status indication using STS \nminimizes both CPU overhead and system power consumption. When configured in \nlevel mode (default mode), it acts as a RY/BY# signal. When low, STS indicates that the WSM is performing a block erase, program, or lock-bit configuration. STS-high indicates \nthat the WSM is ready for a new command, block erase is suspended (and \nprogramming is inactive), program is suspende d, or the device is in reset/power-down \nmode. Additionally, the configuration command allows the STS signal to be configured \nto pulse on completion of programming and/or block erases.\nThree CE signals are used to enable and disable the device. A unique CE logic design \n(see Table 17, “Chip Enable Truth Table for 32-, 64-, 128-Mb” on page 30 ) reduces \ndecoder logic typically required for multi-chip designs. External logic is not required \nwhen designing a single chip, a dual chip, or a 4-chip miniature card or SIMM module.\nThe BYTE# signal allows either x8 or x16 read/writes to the device:\n• BYTE#-low enables 8-bit mode; address A0 selects between the low byte and high \nbyte. \n• BYTE#-high enables16-bit operation; address A1 becomes the lowest order \naddress and address A0 is not used (don’t care). \nFigure 1, “Memory Block Diagram for 32-, 64-, 128-Mbit” on page 11  shows a device \nblock diagram.\nWhen the device is disabled (see Table 17, “Chip Enable Truth Table for 32-, 64-, 128-\nMb” on page 30 ), with CEx at V\nIH and RP# at VIH, the standby mode is enabled. When \nRP# is at VIL, a further power-down mode is enabled which minimizes power \nconsumption and provides write protection during reset. A reset time (tPHQV) is \nrequired from RP# going high until data ou tputs are valid. Likewise, the device has a \nwake time (tPHWL) from RP#-high until writes to the CUI are recognized. With RP# at \nVIL, the WSM is reset and the Status Register is cleared.\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 11Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \n2.1 Block Diagram\nFigure 1: Memory Block Diagram for 32-, 64-, 128-Mbit\n\nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n12 208032-032.2 Memory Map\nFigure 2: J3 65 nm SBC Memory Map\nByte-Wide (x 8 ) Mode128 KB Block128 KB Block\n01 -\n-128 KB Block 31 -128 KB Block 63 -128 KB Block 127 -\n32- Mbit\n64- Mbit\n128- MbitA [23:0]:128 Mbit\nA [22:0]:   64Mbit\nA [21:0]:   32Mbit\nWord-Wide (x16) Mode64 KW Block64 KW Block\n01 -\n-64 KW Block 31 -64 KW Block 63 -64 KW Block 127 -\n32- Mbit\n64- Mbit\n128- MbitA [23:1]:128 Mbit\nA [22:1]:   64Mbit\nA [21:1]:   32Mbit\nF\n0F\n0F\n00EFFFFh\nh\nFFFFF7h\n0000E7h\nFFFFF3h\n0000E3h\nFFFF30h\n000020h\nFFFF10h\n000000hF\n0F\n0F\n00F7FF7h\nh\nFFFFF3h\n0000F3h\nFFFFF1h\n0000F1h\nFFFF10h\n000010h\nFFFF00h\n000000h\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 13Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \n3.0 Package Information\n3.1 56-Lead TSOP Package for 32-, 64-, 128-Mbit\nNotes:\n1.

This \naddress is latched during a x8 program cycle. Not used in x16 mode (i.e., the A0 input buffer is \nturned off when BYTE# is high).\nA[MAX:1] InputADDRESS INPUTS:  Inputs for addresses during read and program operations. Addresses are \ninternally latched during a program cycle:\n32-Mbit — A[21:1]\n64-Mbit— A[22:1]128-Mbit — A[23:1]\nDQ[7:0]Input/\nOutputLOW-BYTE DATA BUS:  Inputs data during buffer writes and programming, and inputs commands \nduring CUI writes. Outputs array, CFI, identifier, or status data in the appropriate read mode. Data \nis internally latched during write operations.\nDQ[15:8]Input/\nOutputHIGH-BYTE DATA BUS: Inputs data during x16 buffer writes and programming operations. \nOutputs array, CFI, or identifier data in the appropriate read mode; not used for Status Register \nreads. Data is internally latched during write operations in x16 mode. D[15:8] float in x8 mode.\nCE[2:0] InputCHIP ENABLE: Activates the 32-, 64-, 128-Mbit devices’ control logic, input buffers, decoders, and \nsense amplifiers. When the device is de-selected (see \nTable 17, “Chip Enable Truth Table \nfor 32-, 64-, 128-Mb” on page 30 ), power reduces to standby levels.\nAll timing specifications are the same for these three signals. Device selection occurs with the first \nedge of CE0, CE1, or CE2 that enables the device. Device deselection occurs with the first edge of \nCE0, CE1, or CE2 that disables the device (see Table 17, “Chip Enable Truth Table for \n32-, 64-, 128-Mb” on page 30 ). \nRP# InputRESET: RP#-low resets internal automation and puts  the device in power-down mode. RP#-high \nenables normal operation. Exit from reset sets the device to read array mode. When driven low, RP# inhibits write operations which provides data protection during power transitions.\nOE# InputOUTPUT ENABLE:  Activates the device’s outputs through the data buffers during a read cycle. \nOE# is active low.\nWE# InputWRITE ENABLE:  Controls writes to the CUI, the Write Buffer, and array blocks. WE# is active low. \nAddresses and data are latched on the rising edge of WE#.\nSTSOpen Drain \nOutputSTATUS:  Indicates the status of the internal state machine. When configured in level mode \n(default), it acts as a RY/BY# signal. When configured in one of its pulse modes, it can pulse to \nindicate program and/or erase completion. For alternate configurations of the Status signal, see the \nConfigurations command and Section 9.7, “Status Signal” on page 41 . STS is to be tied \nto VCCQ with a pull-up resistor.\nBYTE# InputBYTE ENABLE: BYTE#-low places the device in x8 mode; da ta is input or output on D[7:0], while \nD[15:8] is placed in High-Z. Address A0 selects between the high and low byte. BYTE#-high places the device in x16 mode, and turns off the A0 inpu t buffer, the address A1 becomes the lowest-order \naddress bit.\nVPEN InputERASE / PROGRAM / BLOCK LOCK ENABLE:  For erasing array blocks, programming data, or \nconfiguring lock-bits.\nWith V\nPEN ≤ VPENLK, memory contents cannot be altered.\nVCC PowerCORE Power Supply: Core (logic) source voltage. Writes to the flash array are inhibited when  VCC \n≤ VLko.\nCaution: Device operation at invalid Vcc voltages should not be attempted.\nVCCQ Power I/O Power Supply:  Power supply for Input/Output buffers.This ball can be tied directly to VCC.\nVSS Supply GROUND:  Ground reference for device logic voltages. Connect to system ground.\nNC — No Connect:  Lead is not internally connected; it may be driven or floated.\nRFU —Reserved for Future Use: Balls designated as RFU are reserved by Numonyx for future device \nfunctionality and enhancement .\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 19Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \n5.0 Maximum Ratings and Operating Conditions\n5.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings\nWarning: Stressing the device beyond the “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent \ndamage. These are stress ratings only.\n5.2 Operating Conditions\nWarning: Operations beyond the “Operating Conditions” is not recommended and extended \nexposure beyond the “Operating Conditions” may affect device reliability.\n5.3 Power-Up/Down\nThis section provides an overview of system level considerations with regards to the \nflash device. It includes a brief description of power-up/down sequence and decoupling \ndesign considerations.\n5.3.1 Power-Up/Down Sequence\nTo prevent conditions that could result in spurious program or erase operations, the power-up/power-down sequence shown in Table 6  is recommended. For DC voltage \ncharacteristics refer to Table 8 . Note that each power supply must reach its minimum \nvoltage range before applying/removing the next supply voltage.NOTICE: This document contains information available at the time of its release. The specifications are subject to change witho ut \nnotice. Verify with your local Numonyx sales office that you have the latest datasheet before finalizing a design.\nTable 4: Absolute Maximum Ratings\nParameter Min Max Unit Notes\nTemperature under Bias Expanded (TA, Ambient) –40 +85 °C —\nStorage Temperature –65 +125 °C —VCC Voltage –2.0 +5.6 V 2\nVCCQ Voltage –2.0 +5.6 V 2\nVoltage on any input/output signal (except VCC, VCCQ) –2.0 V\nCCQ (max) + 2.0 V 1\nISH Output Short Circuit Current — 100 mA 3\nNotes:\n1. Voltage is referenced to VSS. During infrequent non-periodic transitions, the voltage potential between VSS and input/\noutput pins may undershoot to –2.0 V for periods < 20 ns or overshoot to VCCQ (max) + 2.0 V for periods < 20 ns.\n2. During infrequent non-periodic transitions, the voltage potential between VCC and the supplies may undershoot to –2.0 \nV for periods < 20 ns or VSUPPLY  (max) + 2.0 V for periods < 20 ns.\n3. Output shorted for less than one second. No more than one output pin/ball can be shorted at a time.\nTable 5: Temperature and VCC Operating Condition \nSymbol Parameter Min Max Unit Test Condition\nTA Operating Temperature -40.0 +85 °C Ambient Temperature\nVCC VCC Supply Voltage 2.70 3.6 V —\nVCCQ VCCQ Supply Voltage 2.70 3.6 V —\nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n20 208032-03Note:\n1. Power supplies connected or sequenced together.\nDevice inputs must not be driven until all supply voltages reach their minimum range. \nRP# should be low during power transitions. \n5.3.2 Power Supply Decoupling\nWhen the device is enabled, many internal conditions change. Circuits are energized, charge pumps are switched on, and internal voltage nodes are ramped. All of this \ninternal activities produce transient signals. The magnitude of the transient signals \ndepends on the device and system loading. To minimize the effect of these transient signals, a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor is required across each VCC/VSS and VCCQ\n signal. \nCapacitors should be placed as close as possible to device connections. \nAdditionally, for every eight flash devices, a 4.7 µF electrolytic capacitor should be \nplaced between VCC and VSS at the power supply connection. This 4.7 µF capacitor \nshould help overcome voltage slumps caused by PCB trace inductance.\n5.4 Reset\nBy holding the flash device in reset during power-up and power-down transitions, \ninvalid bus conditions may be masked. The flash device enters reset mode when RP# is driven low. In reset, internal flash circuitry is disabled and outputs are placed in a high-\nimpedance state. After return from reset, a certain amount of time is required before \nthe flash device is able to perform normal operations. After return from reset, the flash device defaults to asynchronous page mode. If RP# is driven low during a program or \nerase operation, the program or erase operation will be aborted and the memory \ncontents at the aborted block or address are no longer valid. See Figure 12, “AC \nWaveform for Reset Operation” on page 28  for detailed information regarding reset \ntimings.Table 6: Power-Up/Down Sequence\nPower Supply \nVoltagePower-Up Sequence Power-Down Sequence\nVCC(min) 1st 1st\n1st(1)\nSequencing not \nrequired(1)3rd 2nd\n2nd(1)\nSequencing not \nrequired(1) VCCQ(min) 2nd\n2nd(1)2nd\n1st(1)\nVPEN(min) 3rd 2nd 1st 1st\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 21Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \n6.0 Electrical Characteristics\n6.1 DC Current Specifications\nTable 7: DC Current Characteristics \nVCCQ 2.7 - 3.6V\nTest Conditions Notes VCC 2.7 - 3.6V\nSymbol Parameter Typ Max Unit\nILI Input and VPEN Load Current — ±1 μAVCC = VCC Max; VCCQ = VCCQ Max\nVIN = VCCQ or VSS1\nILO Output Leakage Current — ±10 μAVCC= VCC Max; VCCQ = VCCQ Max\nVIN = VCCQ or VSS1\nICCS VCC Standby Current50 120 μACMOS Inputs, VCC = VCC Max; Vccq = \nVccqMax\nDevice is disabled (see Table 17, “Chip \nEnable Truth Table for 32-, 64-, \n128-Mb” on page 30 ), \nRP# = VCCQ ± 0.2 V1,2,3\n0.71 2 mATTL Inputs, VCC = VCC Max,\nVccq = VccqMax\nDevice is disabled (see Table 17, “Chip \nEnable Truth Table for 32-, 64-, \n128-Mb” on page 30 ), RP# = VIH\nICCD VCC Power-Down Current 50 120 μAR P #  =  VSS ± 0.2 V, IOUT (STS) = 0 mA —\nICCR 8-Word Page15 20 mACMOS Inputs, VCC = VCC Max, VCCQ = VCCQ \nMax using standard 8 word page mode reads.\nDevice is enabled (see Table 17, “Chip \nEnable Truth Table for 32-, 64-, \n128-Mb” on page 30 )\nf = 5 MHz, IOUT = 0 mA\n1,3\n30 54 mACMOS Inputs,VCC = VCC Max, VCCQ = VCCQ \nMax using standard 8 word page mode \nreads.\nDevice is enabled (see Table 17, “Chip \nEnable Truth Table for 32-, 64-, 128-Mb” on page 30\n)\nf = 33 MHz, IOUT = 0 mA\nICCW VCC Program or Set Lock-Bit Current35 60 mA CMOS Inputs, VPEN = VCC1,4\n40 70 mA TTL Inputs, VPEN = VCC\nICCE\nICCBCVCC Block Erase or VCC Blank Check or \nClear Block Lock-Bits Current35 70 mA CMOS Inputs, VPEN = VCC1,4\n40 80 mA TTL Inputs, VPEN = VCC\nICCWS \nICCESVCC Program Suspend or Block Erase \nSuspend Current—1 0 m ADevice is enabled (see Table 17, “Chip \nEnable Truth Table for 32-, 64-, \n128-Mb” on page 30 )1,5\nNotes:\n1.

The on-chip Write State Machine \n(WSM) manages all erase and program algorithms. The system CPU provides control of \nall in-system read, write, and erase operations through the system bus. All bus cycles \nto or from the flash memory conform to standard microprocessor bus cycles. Table 16  \nsummarizes the necessary states of each control signal for different modes of \noperations.\nNotes:\n1. See Table 17  for valid CEx configurations.\n2. OE# and WE# should never be asserted simultaneously. If done so, OE# overrides WE#.\n3. DQ refers to DQ[7:0] when BYTE# is low and DQ[15:0] if BYTE# is high.4. Refer to DC characteristics. When V\nPEN ≤ VPENLK, memory contents can be read but not altered.\n5. X should be VIL or VIH for the control pins and VPENLK or VPENH for VPEN. For outputs, X should be VOL or VOH.\n6. In default mode, STS is VOL when the WSM is executing internal block erase, program, or a lock-bit configuration \nalgorithm. It is VOH (pulled up by an external pull up resistance  ≈ 10k) when the WSM is not busy, in block erase suspend \nmode (with programming inactive), program suspend mode, or reset power-down mode.\n7. See Section 11.0, “Device Command Codes” on page 47 for valid DIN (user commands) during a Write \noperation.\n8. Array writes are either program or erase operations.

Reading can be performed an unlimited number of \ntimes. Besides array data, other types of data such as device information and device status are available from the flash.\nTo perform a bus read operation, CEx (refer to Table 17 on page 30 ) and OE# must be \nasserted. CEx is the device-select control; when active, it enables the flash memory device. OE# is the data-output control; when  active, the addressed flash memory data \nis driven onto the I/O bus. For all read states, WE# and RP# must be de-asserted. See \nSection 9.2, “Read Operations” on page 35 . \n8.1.1 Asynchronous Page Mode Read\nUnlike J3 130nm devices, J3 65 nm SBC device provides Eight-Word Asynchronous \nPage mode only. Array data can be sensed up to eight words (16 Bytes) at a time. This is the default mode on power-up or reset. \nOn J3 130nm devices, the Set Enhanced Configuration Register command is used to \nenable Eight-Word Page mode upon power-up or reset, however this has no effect on J3 65 nm SBC device anymore. \nAfter the initial access delay, the first word out of the page buffer corresponds to the \ninitial address. Address bits A[3:1] determine which word is output from the page buffer for a x16 bus width, and A[3:0] dete rmine which byte is output from the page \nbuffer for a x8 bus width. Subsequent reads from the device come from the page \nbuffer. These reads are output on DQ[15:0] for a x16 bus width and DQ[7:0] for a x8 bus width after a minimum delay by changing A[3:1] or A[3:0].\nData can be read from the page buffer multip le times, and in any order.If address bits \nA[MAX:4] change at any time, or if CEx# is toggled, the device will sense and load new \ndata into the page buffer. Asynchronous Page mode is the default read mode on power-\nup or reset.\nTo perform a Page mode read after any other operation, the Read Array command must \nbe issued to read from the flash array. Asynchronous Page mode reads are permitted in \nall blocks and are used to access register information. During register access, only one word is loaded into the page buffer.\n8.1.1.1 Enhanced Configuration Register \nThe Enhanced Configuration Register (ECR) is a volatile storage register that when \naddressed by the Set ECR command can select between Four-Word Page mode and \nEight-Word Page mode on J3 130nm devices, however this has no effect on J3 65 nm SBC device. \nThe ECR is volatile; all bits will be reset to default values when RP# is deasserted or \npower is removed from the device. To modify ECR settings, use the Set ECR command. The Set ECR command is written along with the configuration register value, which is \nplaced on the lower 16 bits of the address bus A[16:1]. This is followed by a second \nwrite that confirms the operation and again presents the ECR data on the address bus. After executing this command, the device returns to Read Array mode.\nThe ECR is shown in Table 18 . 8-word page mode Command Bus-Cycle is captured in \nTable 19  for backward compatibility reasons.\nNote: If the 8-word Asynchronous Page mode is used on J3 65 nm SBC, a Clear Status \nRegister command must be executed after issuing the Set ECR command. \nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n32 208032-038.1.2 Output Disable\nWith CEx asserted, and OE# at a logic-high level (VIH), the device outputs are disabled. \nOutput signals DQ[15:0] are placed in a high-impedance state.\n8.2 Bus Writes\nWriting or Programming to the device, is where the host writes information or data into \nthe flash device for non-volatile storage. When the flash device is programmed, ‘ones’ are changed to ‘zeros’. ‘Zeros’ cannot be pr ogramed back to ‘ones’. To do so, an erase \noperation must be performed.  Writing commands to the Command User Interface (CUI) \nenables various modes of operation, including the following:\n• Reading of array data• Common Flash Interface (CFI) data• Identifier codes, inspection, and clearing of the Status Register• Block Erasure, Program, and Lock-bit Configuration (when V\nPEN = VPENH)\nErasing is performed on a block basis – all flash cells within a block are erased together. \nAny information or data previously stored in the block will be lost. Erasing is typically \ndone prior to programming. The Block Er ase command requires appropriate command \ndata and an address within the block to be erased. The Byte/Word Program command \nrequires the command and address of the location to be written. Set Block Lock-Bit \ncommands require the command and block within the device to be locked. The Clear Block Lock-Bits command requires the command and address within the device to be \ncleared.\nThe CUI does not occupy an addressable memory location. It is written when the device \nis enabled and WE# is active. The address and data needed to execute a command are \nlatched on the rising edge of WE# or CE\nX (CEX low is defined as the combination of pins \nCE0, CE1, and CE2 that enable the device. CEX high is defined as the combination of \npins CE0, CE1, and CE2 that disable the device. See Table 17 on page 30 ). Standard \nmicroprocessor write timings are used.Table 18: Enhanced Configuration Register\nReservedPage \nLengthReserved\nECR\n15ECR\n14ECR\n13ECR\n12ECR\n11ECR\n10ECR\n9ECR\n8ECR\n7ECR\n6ECR\n5ECR\n4ECR\n3ECR\n2ECR\n1ECR\n0\nBITS DESCRIPTION NOTES\nECR[15:14] RFU All bits should be set to 0.\nECR.13• “1” = 8-Word Page mode \n• “0” = 8-Word Page mode (Default)Either “1” or “0” is for 8-word sense in page \nmode.\nECR[12:0] RFU All bits should be set to 0.\nTable 19: Asynchronous 8-Word Page Mode Command Bus-Cycle Definition \nCommandBus \nCycles \nRequiredFirst Bus Cycle Second Bus Cycle\nOper Addr(1)Data Oper Addr(1)Data\nSet Enhanced Configuration \nRegister (Set ECR)2 Write ECD 0060h Write ECD 0004h\n1.

This manipulation of CEx substantially reduces device power \nconsumption. DQ[15:0] outputs are placed in a high-impedance state independent of OE#. If deselected during block erase, program, or lock-bit configuration, the WSM \ncontinues functioning, and consuming active power until the operation completes.\n8.3.1 Reset/Power-Down\nRP# at VIL initiates the reset/power-down mode.\nIn read modes, RP#-low deselects the memory, places output drivers in a high-\nimpedance state, and turns off numerous internal circuits. RP# must be held low for a minimum of t\nPLPH. Time tPHQV is required after return from reset mode until initial \nmemory access outputs are valid. After this wake-up interval, normal operation is \nrestored. The CUI is reset to read array mo de and Status Register is set to 0080h.\nDuring Block Erase, Program, or Lock-Bit Configuration modes, RP#-low will abort the \noperation. In default mode, STS transitions low and remains low for a maximum time \nof tPLPH + tPHRH until the reset operation is complete. Memory contents being altered \nare no longer valid; the data may be part ially corrupted after a program or partially \naltered after an erase or lock-bit configuration. Time tPHWL is required after RP# goes to \nlogic-high (VIH) before another command can be written.\nAs with any automated device, it is important to assert RP# during system reset. When \nthe system comes out of reset, it expects to read from the flash memory. Automated \nflash memories provide status information when accessed during Block Erase, Program, or Lock-Bit Configuration modes. If a CPU reset occurs with no flash memory reset, \nproper initialization may not occur because the flash memory may be providing status \ninformation instead of array data. Numonyx Flash memories allow proper initialization \nfollowing a system reset through the use of the RP# input. In this application, RP# is \ncontrolled by the same RESET# signal that resets the system CPU.\n8.4 Device Commands\nWhen VPEN ≤ VPENLK, only read operations from the Status Register, CFI, identifier \ncodes, or blocks are enabled. Placing VPENH on VPEN additionally enables block erase, \nprogram, and lock-bit configuration operations. Device operations are selected by \nwriting specific commands to the Command User Interface (CUI). The CUI does not \noccupy an addressable memory location. It is the mechanism through which the flash device is controlled. \nA command sequence is issued in two consecutive write cycles - a Setup command \nfollowed by a Confirm command. However, some commands are single-cycle commands consisting of a setup command only. Generally, commands that alter the \ncontents of the flash device, such as Program or Erase, require at least two write cycles \nto guard against inadvertent changes to the flash device. Flash commands fall into two categories: Basic Commands and Extended Commands. Basic commands are \nrecognized by all Numonyx Flash devices, and are used to perform common flash \noperations such as selecting the read mode, programming the array, or erasing blocks. Extended commands are product-dependant; they are used to perform additional \nfeatures such as software block locking. Section 11.0, “Device Command Codes” on \npage 47  describes all applicable commands on J3 65 nm SBC device.\nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n34 208032-039.0 Flash Operations\nThis section describes the operational features of flash memory. Operations are \ncommand-based, wherein command codes are first issued to the device, then the \ndevice performs the desired operation. All command codes are issued to the device \nusing bus-write cycles (see Chapter 8.0, “Bus Interface” ). A complete list of available \ncommand codes can be found in Section 11.0, “Device Command Codes” on page 47 .\n9.1 Status Register\nThe Status Register (SR) is an 8-bit, read-only register that indicates device status and \noperation errors. To read the Status Register, issue the Read Status Register command. \nSubsequent reads output Status Register information on DQ[7:0], and 00h on \nDQ[15:8].\nSR status bits  are set and cleared by the device. SR error bits  are set by the device, but \nmust be cleared using the Clear Status Register command. Upon power-up or exit from \nreset, the Status Register defaults to 80h. Page-mode reads are not supported in this read mode. Status Register contents are latched on the falling edge of OE# or CE\nX (CEX \nlow is defined as the combination of pins CE0, CE1, and CE2 that enable the device. \nCEX high is defined as the combination of pins CE0, CE1, and CE2 that disable the \ndevice). OE# must toggle to VIH or the device must be disabled before further reads to \nupdate the Status Register latch. The Read Status Register command functions \nindependently of VPEN voltage.\nTable 20  shows Status Register bit definitions.\nTable 20: Status Register Bit Definitions\nStatus Register (SR) Default Value = 80h\nReady\nStatusErase\nSuspend\nStatusErase\nErrorProgram\nErrorProgram/\nErase\nVoltage\nErrorProgram\nSuspend\nStatusBlock-Locked \nErrorReserved\n76 5 4 3 2 1 0\nBit Name Description\n7R e a d y  S t a t u s0 = Device is busy.

SR \nstatus bits  are cleared by the device, however SR error bits  are cleared by issuing the \nClear SR command (see Table 21 ). Resetting the device also clears the SR.\nIssuing the Clear SR command places the device in Read SR mode. \nNote: Care should be taken to avoid SR ambiguity. If a command sequence error occurs while \nin an Erase Suspend condition, the SR will indicate a Command Sequence error by \nsetting SR.4 and SR.5. When the erase operation is resumed (and finishes), any errors that may have occurred during the erase operation will be masked by the Command \nSequence error. To avoid this situation, clear the Status Register prior to resuming a \nsuspended erase operation. The Clear SR command functions independent of the voltage level on VPEN.\n9.2 Read Operations\nFour types of data can be read from the device: array data, device information, CFI data, and device status. Upon power-up or return from reset, the device defaults to \nRead Array mode. To change the device’s read mode, the appropriate command must \nbe issued to the device. Table 22  shows the command codes used to configure the \ndevice for the desired read mode. The following sections describe each read mode.\n9.2.1 Read Array\nUpon power-up or return from reset, the device defaults to Read Array mode. Issuing \nthe Read Array command places the device  in Read Array mode. Subsequent reads \noutput array data on DQ[15:0]. The device remains in Read Array mode until a different read command is issued, or a program or erase operation is performed, in \nwhich case, the read mode is automatically changed to Read Status.\nTo change the device to Read Array mode while it is programming or erasing, first issue \nthe Suspend command. After the operation has been suspended, issue the Read Array \ncommand. When the program or erase operation is subsequently resumed, the device \nwill automatically revert back to Read Status mode.\nNote: Issuing the Read Array command to the device while it is actively programming or \nerasing causes subsequent reads from the de vice to output invalid data. Valid array \ndata is output only after the program or erase operation has finished.Table 21: Clear Status Register Command Bus-Cycles\nCommandSetup Write Cycle Confirm Write Cycle\nAddress Bus Data Bus Address Bus Data Bus\nClear Status Register Device Address 0050h — —\nTable 22: Read Mode Command Bus-Cycles\nCommandSetup Write Cycle Confirm Write Cycle\nAddress Bus Data Bus Address Bus Data Bus\nRead Array Device Address 00FFh — —\nRead Status Register Device Address 0070h — —Read Device Information Device Address 0090h — —\nCFI Query Device Address 0098h — —\nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n36 208032-03The Read Array command functions independent of the voltage level on VPEN.\n9.2.2 Read Status Register\nIssuing the Read Status Register command places the device in Read Status Register \nmode. Subsequent reads output Status Register information on DQ[7:0], and 00h on DQ[15:8]. The device remains in Read Status Register mode until a different read-\nmode command is issued. Performing a program, erase, or block-lock operation also \nchanges the device’s read mode to Read Status Register mode.\nThe Status Register is updated on the falling edge of OE# or CEx, whichever occurs \nlast. Status Register contents are valid only when SR.7 = 1. When WSM is active, SR.7 \nindicates the WSM’s state and SR[6:0] are in high-Z state. \nThe Read Status Register command functions independent of the voltage level on \nVPEN.\n9.2.3 Read Device Information\nIssuing the Read Device Information command places the device in Read Device Information mode. Subsequent reads output device information on DQ[15:0].\nThe device remains in Read Device Information mode until a different read command is \nissued. Also, performing a program, erase, or block-lock operation changes the device \nto Read Status Register mode.\nThe Read Device Information command functions independent of the voltage level on \nVPEN.\n9.2.4 CFI Query\nThe CFI query table contains an assortment of flash product information such as block \nsize, density, allowable command sets, electrical specifications, and other product \ninformation. The data contained in this table conforms to the CFI protocol.\nIssuing the CFI Query command places the device in CFI Query mode. Subsequent \nreads output CFI information on DQ[15:0]. The device remains in CFI Query mode until \na different read command is issued, or a program or erase operation is performed, which changes the read mode to Read Status Register mode.\nThe CFI Query command functions independent of the voltage level on VPEN.\n9.3 Programming Operations\nAll programming operations require the addressed block to be unlocked, and a valid \nVPEN  voltage applied throughout the programming operation. Otherwise, the \nprogramming operation will abort, setting the appropriate Status Register error bit(s).\nThe following sections describe each programming method.\n9.3.1 Single-Word/Byte Programming\nArray programming is performed by first issuing the Single-Word/Byte Program \ncommand. This is followed by writing the desired data at the desired array address. The \nread mode of the device is automatically changed to Read Status Register mode, which \nremains in effect until another read-mode command is issued.\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 37Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \nDuring programming, STS and the Status Register indicate a busy status (SR.7 = 0). \nUpon completion, STS and the Status Register indicate a ready status (SR.7 = 1). The \nStatus Register should be checked for any errors (SR.4), then cleared.\nNote: Issuing the Read Array command to the device while it is actively programming causes \nsubsequent reads from the device to output invalid data. Valid array data is output only after the program operation has finished.\nStandby power levels are not be realized until the programming operation has finished. \nAlso, asserting RP# aborts the programming operation, and array contents at the addressed location are indeterminate. The addressed block should be erased, and the \ndata re-programmed. If a Single-Word/Byte program is attempted when the \ncorresponding block lock-bit is set, SR.1 and SR.4 will be set.\n9.3.2 Buffered Programming \nBuffered programming operations simultaneously program multiple words/bytes into the flash memory array, significantly reducing effective word-write/byte-write times. User-data is first written to a write buffer, then programmed into the flash memory \narray in buffer-size increments. For additional details, see the flow chart of the \nbuffered-programming operation.\nOptimal performance and power consumption is realized by aligning the start address \non 256-Word boundaries (i.e., A[8:1] = 00000000b). Crossing a 256-Word boundary \nduring a buffered programming operation can cause programming time to double.\nTo perform a buffered programming operation, first issue the Buffered Program setup \ncommand at the desired starting address. The read mode of the device/addressed \npartition is automatically changed to Read Status Register mode.\nPolling SR.7 determines write-buffer availability (0 = not available, 1 = available). If \nthe write buffer is not available, re-issue the setup command and check SR.7; repeat \nuntil SR.7 = 1.\nNote: The device defaults to output SR data after the Buffered Programming Setup command \n(E8h) is issued. CE# and OE# must be toggle d to update Status Register. Don’t issue \nthe Read SR command (70h), which would be interpreted by the internal state machine as Buffer Word Count.\nNext, issue the word count at the desired starting address. The word count represents \nthe total number of words to be written into the write buffer, minus one. This value can range from 00h (one) to a maximum of FFh (256). Exceeding the allowable range \ncauses an abort. \nNote: The maximum number of bytes in write buffer on CFI region (offset 2Ah, refer Table 41, \n“Device Geometry Definition” on page 60 ) is set to 05h (32 bytes) for backward \ncompatible reasons. No software change is required on existing applications for both x8 \nand x16 mode. Applications can optimize the system performance using the maximum \nof 256 buffer size. Please contact your sales representatives for questions.\nFollowing the word count, the write buffer is filled with user-data. Subsequent bus-\nwrite cycles provide addresses and data, up to the word count. All user-data addresses \nmust lie between <starting address> and <starting address + word count>, otherwise the WSM continues to run as normal but, user may advertently change the content in \nunexpected address locations.\nNote: User-data is programmed into the flash array at the address issued when filling the \nwrite buffer.\nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n38 208032-03After all user-data is written into the write buffer, issue the confirm command. If a \ncommand other than the confirm command is issued to the device, a command \nsequence error occurs and the operation aborts.\nNote: After issuing the confirm command, write-buffer contents are programmed into the \nflash memory array. The Status Register indicates a busy status (SR.7 = 0) during array programming.Issuing the Read Array command to the device while it is actively \nprogramming or erasing causes subsequent reads from the device to output invalid \ndata. Valid array data is output only after the program or erase operation has finished.\nUpon completion of array programming, the Status Register indicates ready (SR.7 = 1). \nA full Status Register check should be performed to check for any programming errors, \nthen cleared by using the Clear Status Register command.\nAdditional buffered programming operations can be initiated by issuing another setup \ncommand, and repeating the buffered programming bus-cycle sequence. However, any \nerrors in the Status Register must first be cleared before another buffered programming operation can be initiated.\n9.4 Block Erase Operations\nErasing a block changes ‘zeros’ to ‘ones’. To change ones to zeros, a program operation must be performed (See Section 9.3, “Programming Operations” ). Erasing is performed \non a block basis - an entire block is erased each time an erase command sequence is \nissued. Once a block is fully erased, all addr essable locations within that block read as \nlogical ones (FFFFh for x16 mode, FFh for x8 mode). Only one block-erase operation \ncan occur at a time, and is not  permitted during a program suspend.\nTo perform a block-erase operation, issue the Block Erase command sequence at the \ndesired block address. Table 23  shows the two-cycle Block Erase command sequence.\nNote: A block-erase operation requires the addressed block to be unlocked, and a valid \nvoltage applied to VPEN throughout the block-erase operation. Otherwise, the operation will abort, setting the appropriate Status Register error bit(s).\nThe Erase Confirm command latches the address of the block to be erased. The \naddressed block is preconditioned (programme d to all zeros), erased, and then verified. \nThe read mode of the device is automatically changed to Read Status Register mode, \nand remains in effect until another read-mode command is issued.\nDuring a block-erase operation, STS and the Status Register indicates a busy status \n(SR.7 = 0). Upon completion, STS and the Status Register indicates a ready status \n(SR.7 = 1). The Status Register should be checked for any errors, then cleared. If any \nerrors did occur, subsequent erase commands to the device are ignored unless the Status Register is cleared.\nThe only valid commands during a block erase operation are Read Array, Read Device \nInformation, CFI Query, and Erase Suspend. After the block-erase operation has completed, any valid command can be issued.Table 23: Block-Erase Command Bus-Cycles\nCommandSetup Write Cycle Confirm Write Cycle\nAddress Bus Data Bus Address Bus Data Bus\nBlock Erase Block Address 0020h Block Address 00D0h\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 39Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \nNote: Issuing the Read Array command to the device while it is actively erasing causes \nsubsequent reads from the device to output invalid data. Valid array data is output only \nafter the block-erase operation has finished.\nStandby power levels are not be realized until the block-erase operation has finished. \nAlso, asserting RP# aborts the block-erase operation, and array contents at the \naddressed location are indeterminate. The addressed block should be erased before \nprogramming within the block is attempted.\n9.5 Blank Check\nThe Blank Check operation determines whether a specified array block is blank (i.e. completely erased). Without Blank Check, Block Erase would be the only other way to ensure a block is completely erased. Blank Check is especially useful in the case of \nerase operation interrupted by a power loss event.\nBlank Check can apply to only one block at a time, and no operations other than Status \nRegister Reads are allowed during Blank Check (e.g. reading array data, program, \nerase etc.). Suspend and resume operations are not supported during Blank Check, nor \nis Blank Check supported during any suspended operations.\nBlank Check operations are initiated by writing the Block Blank Check command to the \nblock address. Next, the Blank Check Confirm command is issued along with the same \nblock address. When a successful command sequence is entered, the device automatically enters the Read Status State. The WSM then reads the entire specified \nblock, and determines whether any bit in the block is programmed or over-erased.\nThe status register can be examined for Blank Check progress and errors by reading \nany address within the block being accessed. During a blank check operation, the \nStatus Register indicates a busy status (SR.7 = 0). Upon completion, the Status \nRegister indicates a ready status (SR.7 = 1). The Status Register should be checked for \nany errors, and then cleared. If the Blank Check operation fails, which means the block \nis not completely erased, the Status Register bit SR.5 will be set (“1”). CE# or OE# toggle (during polling) updates the Status Register.\nThe device remains in Status Register Mode until another command is written to the \ndevice. After examining the Status Register, it should be cleared by the Clear Status Register command before issuing a new command. Any command can follow once the \nBlank Check command is complete.\n9.6 Suspend and Resume\nAn erase or programming operation can be suspended to perform other operations, and then subsequently resumed. Table 24  shows the Suspend and Resume command bus-\ncycles.\nNote: All erase and programming operations require the addressed block to remain unlocked \nwith a valid voltage applied to VPEN throughout the suspend operation. Otherwise, the \nblock-erase or programming operation will abort, setting the appropriate Status \nRegister error bit(s). Also, asserting RP# aborts suspended block-erase and \nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n40 208032-03programming operations, rendering array contents at the addressed location(s) \nindeterminate.\nTo suspend an on-going erase or program operation, issue the Suspend command to \nany device address. The program or erase operation suspends at pre-determined points during the operation after a delay of t\nSUSP. Suspend is achieved whenSTS (in RY/BY# \nmode) goes high, SR[7,6] = 1 (erase-suspend) or SR[7,2] = 1 (program-suspend).\nNote: Issuing the Suspend command does not change the read mode of the device. The \ndevice will be in Read Status Register mode from when the erase or program command was first issued, unless the read mode was changed prior to issuing the Suspend \ncommand.\nNot all commands are allowed when the device is suspended. Table 25  shows which \ndevice commands are allowed during Program Suspend or Erase Suspend.\nDuring Suspend, array-read operations are not allowed in blocks being erased or \nprogrammed.\nA block-erase under program-suspend is not allowed. However, word-program under \nerase-suspend is allowed, and can be suspended. This results in a simultaneous erase-\nsuspend/ program-suspend condition, indicated by SR[7,6,2] = 1.Table 24: Suspend and Resume Command Bus-Cycles\nCommandSetup Write Cycle Confirm Write Cycle\nAddress Bus Data Bus Address Bus Data Bus\nSuspend Device Address 00B0h — —\nResume Device Address 00D0h — —\nTable 25: Valid Commands During Suspend \nDevice Command Program Suspend Erase Suspend\nSTS Configuratio n Allowed Allowed\nRead Array Allowed AllowedRead Status Register Allowed Allowed\nClear Status Register Allowed Allowed\nRead Device Information Allowed AllowedCFI Query Allowed Allowed\nWord/Byte Program Not Allowed Allowed\nBuffered Program Not Allowed  AllowedBlock Erase Not Allowed Not Allowed\nProgram Suspend Not Allowed Allowed\nErase Suspend Not Allowed Not AllowedProgram/Erase Resume Allowed Allowed\nLock Block Not Allowed Not Allowed\nUnlock Block Not Allowed Not AllowedProgram OTP Register Not Allowed Not Allowed\nBlank Check Not Allowed Not Allowed\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 41Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \nTo resume a suspended program or erase operation, issue the Resume command to \nany device address. The read mode of the device is automatically changed to Read \nStatus Register. The operation continues where it left off, STS (in RY/BY# mode) goes \nlow, and the respective Status Register bits are cleared.\nWhen the Resume command is issued during a simultaneous erase-suspend/ program-\nsuspend condition, the programming operation is resumed first. Upon completion of the \nprogramming operation, the Status Register should be checked for any errors, and cleared. The resume command must be issued again to complete the erase operation. \nUpon completion of the erase operation, the Status Register should be checked for any \nerrors, and cleared.\n9.7 Status Signal \nThe STATUS (STS) signal can be configured to different states using the STS Configuration command ( Table 26 ). Once the STS signal has been configured, it \nremains in that configuration until another Configuration command is issued or RP# is \nasserted low. Initially, the STS signal defaults to RY/BY# operation where RY/BY# low \nindicates that the WSM is busy. RY/BY# high indicates that the state machine is ready for a new operation or suspended. Table 27  displays possible STS configurations.\nTo reconfigure the STATUS (STS) signal to other modes, the Configuration command is \ngiven followed by the desired configuration code. The three alternate configurations are \nall pulse mode for use as a system interrupt as described in the following paragraphs. \nFor these configurations, bit 0 controls Erase Complete interrupt pulse, and bit 1 \ncontrols Program Complete interrupt pulse. Supplying the 00h configuration code with \nthe Configuration command resets the STS signal to the default RY/BY# level mode. The Configuration command may only be given when the device is not busy or \nsuspended. Check SR.7 for device status. An invalid configuration code will result in \nSR.4 and SR.5 being set. \nNote: STS Pulse mode is not supported in the Clear Lock Bits and Set Lock Bit commands.Table 26: STS Configuration Register Command Bus-Cycles\nCommandSetup Write Cycle Confirm Write Cycle\nAddress Bus Data Bus Address Bus Data Bus\nSTS Configuration Device Address 00B8h Device Address Register Data\nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n42 208032-039.8 Security and Protection\nJ3 65 nm SBC device offers both hardware and software security features. Block lock \noperations, PRs and VPEN allow users to implement various levels of data protection.\n9.8.1 Normal Block Locking\nJ3 65 nm SBC has the capability of Flexible Block Locking (locked blocks remain locked \nupon reset or power cycle): All blocks within the device are in unlocked state when ship from Numonyx. Blocks can be locked individually by issuing the Set Block Lock Bit \ncommand sequence to any address within a block. Once locked, blocks remain locked \nwhen power is removed, or when the device is reset.\nAll locked blocks are unlocked simultaneously by issuing the Clear Block Lock Bits \ncommand sequence to any device address. Locked blocks cannot be erased or \nprogrammed. Table 28  summarizes the command bus-cycles.\nAfter issuing the Set Block Lock Bit setup command or Clear Block Lock Bits setup \ncommand, the device’s read mode is automatically changed to Read Status Register \nmode. After issuing the confirm command, completion of the operation is indicated by STS (in RY/BY# mode) going high and SR.7 = 1.\nBlocks cannot be locked or unlocked while programming or erasing, or while the device \nis suspended. Reliable block lock and unlock operations occur only when V\nCC and VPEN \nare valid. When VPEN ≤ VPENLK, block lock-bits cannot be changed.Table 27: STS Configuration Register and Coding Definitions\nD7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nReserved3Pulse on \nProgram \nComplete1Pulse on \nErase \nComplete1\nD[1:0] = STS Configuration Codes2Notes\n00 = default, level mode;\n device ready indication Controls HOLD to a memory controller to prevent accessing a flash memory \nsubsystem while any flash device\'s WSM is busy.\n01 = pulse on Erase CompleteGenerates a system interrupt pulse when any flash device in an array has \ncompleted a block erase.

Reserved bits are invalid should be ignored.\nTable 28: Block Locking Command Bus-Cycles\nCommandSetup Write Cycle Confirm Write Cycle\nAddress Bus Data Bus Address Bus Data Bus\nSet Block Lock Bit Block Address 0060h Block Address 0001h\nClear Block Lock Bits Device Address 0060h Device Address 00D0h\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 43Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \nWhen the set lock-bit operation is complete, SR.4 should be checked for any error. \nWhen the clear lock-bit operation is complete, SR.5 should be checked for any error. \nErrors bits must be cleared using the Clear Status Register command.\nBlock lock-bit status can be determined by first issuing the Read Device Information \ncommand, and then reading from <block base address> + 02h. DQ0 indicates the lock \nstatus of the addressed block (0 = unlocked, 1 = locked).\n9.8.2 Configurable Block Locking\nJ3 65 nm SBC devices feature user-configurable block locking. This feature can be implemented to protect and/or secure the user’s system. The user can individually set \neach block as Non-Volatile Temporary, Non-Volatile Semi-Permanent or Non-Volatile Permanent. For additional information and collateral, please contact the sales \nrepresentative.\n9.8.3 Password Access\nPassword Access is a security enhancement offered on the J3 65 nm SBC device. This feature protects information stored in main-array memory blocks by preventing content \nalteration or reads, until a valid 64-bit password is received. Password Access may be combined with Non-Volatile Protection and/or Volatile Protection to create a multi-\ntiered solution. \nPlease contact your Numonyx Sales for further details concerning Password Access.\n9.8.4 128-bit OTP Protection Register\nJ3 65 nm SBC includes a 128-bit Protection Register (PR) that can be used to increase \nthe security of a system design. For example, the number contained in the PR can be \nused to “match” the flash component with other system components such as the CPU \nor ASIC, hence preventing device substitution.\nThe 128-bits of the PR are divided into two 64-bit segments:\n• One segment is programmed at the Numonyx factory with a unique unalterable 64-\nbit number.\n• The other segment is left blank for customer designers to program as desired. Once \nthe customer segment is programmed, it can be locked to prevent further programming.\n9.8.5 Reading the 128-bit OTP Protection Register\nThe Protection Register is read in Identification Read mode. The device is switched to this mode by issuing the Read Identifier command (0090h). Once in this mode, read \ncycles from addresses shown in Table 31, “Word-Wide Protection Register Addressing”  \nor Table 32, “Byte-Wide Protection Register Addressing”  retrieve the specified \ninformation. To return to Read Array mode, write the Read Array command (00FFh).\n9.8.6 Programming the 128-bi t OTP Protection Register\nPR bits are programmed using the two-cycle Program OTP Register command. The 64-\nbit number is programmed 16 bits at a time for word-wide configuration and eight bits \nat a time for byte-wide configuration. First write the Protection Program Setup \ncommand, 00C0h. The next write to the device will latch in address and data and program the specified location. The allowable addresses are shown in Table 31, “Word-\nWide Protection Register Addressing” on page 45  or Table 32, “Byte-Wide Protection \nRegister Addressing” on page 45 . See Figure 24, “Protection Register Programming \nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n44 208032-03Flowchart” on page 56 . Any attempt to address Program OTP Register command \noutside the defined PR address space will result in a Status Register error (SR.4 will be \nset). Attempting to program a locked PR segment will result in a Status Register error \n(SR.4 and SR.1 will be set).\n9.8.7 Locking the 128-bit OTP Protection Register\nThe user-programmable segment of the PR is lockable by programming Bit 1 of the \nProtection Lock Register (PLR) to 0. Bit 0 of this location is programmed to 0 at the Numonyx factory to protect the unique device number. Bit 1 is set using the Protection \nProgram command to program “0xFFFD” to the PLR. After these bits have been \nprogrammed, no further changes can be made to the values stored in the Protection Register. Protection Program commands to a locked section will result in a Status \nRegister error (SR.4 and SR.1 will be set). The PR lockout state is not reversible.\nNote: A0 is not used in x16 mode when accessing the protection register map. See Table 31  for x16 addressing. In x8 mode \nA0 is used, see Table 32  for x8 addressing.

Whenever a valid voltage is present on VPEN, blocks within the main flash array can be erased or programmed. By grounding VPEN, \nblocks within the main array cannot be altered – attempts to program or erase blocks \nwill fail resulting in the setting of the appropriate error bit in the Status Register. By holding VPEN low, absolute write protection of all blocks in the array can be achieved.Table 31: Word-Wide Protection Register Addressing\nW o r d U s e A 8A 7A 6A 5A 4A 3A 2A 1\nL O C K B o t h 10000000\n0 F a c t o r y 100000011 F a c t o r y 100000102 F a c t o r y 100000113 F a c t o r y 100001004 U s e r 100001015 U s e r 100001106 U s e r 100001117 U s e r 10001000\nNote: All address lines not specified in the above table must be 0 when accessing the Protection Register (i.e., A[MAX:9] = 0.)\nTable 32: Byte-Wide Protection Register Addressing\nB y t eU s eA 8A 7A 6A 5A 4A 3A 2A 1A 0\nL O C K B o t h 100000000\nL O C K B o t h 100000001\n0 F a c t o r y 100000010\n1 F a c t o r y 100000011\n2 F a c t o r y 1000001003 F a c t o r y 100000101\n4 F a c t o r y 100000110\n5 F a c t o r y 1000001116 F a c t o r y 100001000\n7 F a c t o r y 100001001\n8U s e r 1000010109U s e r 100001011\nAU s e r 100001100\nBU s e r 100001101CU s e r 100001110\nDU s e r 100001111\nEU s e r 100010000\nFU s e r 100010001\nNote: All address lines not specified in the above table must be 0 when accessing the Protection Register, i.e., A[MAX:9] = 0.\nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n46 208032-0310.0 ID Codes\nTable 33: Read Identifier Codes\nCode Address Data\nDevice Code32-Mbit 00001h 0016h\n64-Mbit 00001h 0017h\n128-Mbit 00001h 0018h\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 47Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \n11.0 Device Command Codes\nFor a complete definition on device operations refer to Section 8.4, “Device Commands” \non page 33 . The list of all applicable commands are included here one more time for \nthe convenience.\nNote: Some customer applications use illegal or invalid commands (like 0x00) accidentally or \nintentionally with the device. An illegal or invalid command caused the device output to change to Array Read mode on 130nm.

This allows device independent, JEDEC ID-independent, and forward- and \nbackward-compatible software support for the specified flash device families. It allows \nflash vendors to standardize their existing interfaces for long-term compatibility.\nThis section defines the data structure or “database” returned by the (CFI) Query \ncommand. System software should parse this structure to gain critical information such as block size, density, x8/x16, and electrical  specifications. Once this information has \nbeen obtained, the software will know which command sets to use to enable flash \nwrites, block erases, and otherwise control the flash component. The Query is part of an overall specification for multiple command set and control interface descriptions \ncalled CFI.\n13.1 Query Structure Output\nThe Query “database” allows system software to gain information for controlling the flash component. This section describes the device’s CFI-compliant interface that allows \nthe host system to access Query data.\nQuery data are always presented on the lowest-order data outputs (D[7:0]) only. The \nnumerical offset value is the address relative to the maximum bus width supported by \nthe device. On this family of devices, the Query table device starting address is a 10h, which is a word address for x16 devices.\nFor a word-wide (x16) device, the first two bytes of the Query structure, “Q” and “R” in \nASCII, appear on the low byte at word addresses 10h and 11h. This CFI-compliant device outputs 00h data on upper bytes. Thus, the device outputs ASCII “Q” in the low \nbyte (D[7:0]) and 00h in the high byte (D[15:8]).\nAt Query addresses containing two or more bytes of information, the least significant \ndata byte is presented at the lower addre ss, and the most significant data byte is \npresented at the higher address.\nIn all of the following tables, addresses and data are represented in hexadecimal \nnotation, so the “h” suffix has been dropped. In addition, since the upper byte of word-\nwide devices is always “00h,” the leading “00” has been dropped from the table notation and only the lower byte value is shown. Any x16 device outputs can be \nassumed to have 00h on the upper byte in this mode.\nTable 35: Summary of Query Structure Outp ut as a Function of Device and Mode\nDevice \nType/\nModeQuery start location in \nmaximum device bus \nwidth addressesQuery data with maximum device \nbus width addressingQuery data with byte addressing\nHex \nOffsetHex CodeASCII \nValueHex \nOffsetHex CodeASCII \nValue\nx16 device 10h 10: 0051 “Q” 20: 51 “Q”\nx16 mode 11: 0052 “R” 21: 00 “Null”\n12: 0059 “Y” 22: 52 “R”\nx16 device 20: 51 “Q”\nNumonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC)\nDatasheet Jan 2011\n58 208032-0313.2 Query Structure Overview\nThe Query command causes the flash component to display the Common Flash \nInterface (CFI) Query structure or “database.” The structure sub-sections and address \nlocations are summarized below. See AP-646 Common Flash Interface (CFI) and \nCommand Sets  (order number 292204) for a full description of CFI. \nThe following sections describe the Query structure sub-sections in detail.x8 mode N/A(1)N/A(1)21: 51 “Q”\n22: 52 “R”\nNote:\n1. The system must drive the lowest order addresses to access a ll the device\'s array data when the device is configured in \nx8 mode. Therefore, word addressing, where these lower addresses are not toggled by the system, is "Not Applicable" \nfor x8-configured devices.\nTable 36: Example of Query Structure Output of a x16- and x8-Capable Device\nWord Addressing Byte Addressing\nOffset Hex Code Value Offset Hex Code Value\nA15–A0 D15–D0 A7–A0 D7–D0\n0010h 0051 “Q” 20h 51 “Q”\n0011h 0052 “R” 21h 51 “Q”\n0012h 0059 “Y” 22h 52 “R”0013h P_ID\nLO PrVendor 23h 52 “R”\n0014h P_IDHI ID # 24h 59 “Y”\n0015h PLO PrVendor 25h 59 “Y”\n0016h PHI TblAdr 26h P_IDLO PrVendor\n0017h A_IDLO AltVendor 27h P_IDLO PrVendor\n0018h A_IDHI ID # 28h P_IDHI ID #\n... ... ... ... ... ...Table 35: Summary of Query Structure Output as a Function of Device and Mode\nDevice \nType/\nModeQuery start location in \nmaximum device bus \nwidth addressesQuery data with maximum device \nbus width addressingQuery data with byte addressing\nHex \nOffsetHex CodeASCII \nValueHex \nOffsetHex CodeASCII \nValue\nTable 37: Query Structure\nOffset Sub-Section Name Description Notes\n00h Identification Code Manufacturer Code 1\n01h Identification Code Device Code 1\n(BA+2)h(2)Block Status Register Block-Specific Information 1,2\n04-0Fh Reserved Reserved for Vendor-Specific Information 1\n10h CFI Query Identification String Reserved for Vendor-Specific Information 1\n1Bh System Interface Information Command Set ID and Vendor Data Offset 1\nJan 2011 Datasheet\n208032-03 59Numonyx® Embedded Flash Memory (J3 65 nm) Single Bit per Cell (SBC) \n13.3 Block Status Register\nThe Block Status Register indicates whether an erase operation completed successfully \nor whether a given block is locked or can be accessed for flash program/erase operations.\n13.4 CFI Query Identification String\nThe CFI Query Identification String provides verification that the component supports \nthe Common Flash Interface specification.
