The NCT218\noperates over a supply range of 1.4 V to 2.75 V making it possible touse it in a wide range of applications including low power devices.\nThe NCT218 can measure the temperature of a remote thermal diode\naccurate to ±1°C and the ambient temperature accurate to ±1.75°C.\nThe device operates over a wide temperature range of −40°C to\n+125 °C.\nThe NCT218 includes series resistance cancellation, where up to\n500/C0087 (typical) of resistance in series with the temperature monitoring\ndiode can be automatically cancelled from the temperature result,allowing noise filtering. The NCT218 has a configurable ALERT\noutput and overtemperature shutdown THERM  pin.\nCommunication with the NCT218 is accomplished via the I2C\ninterface which is compatible with industry standard protocols.Through this interface the NCT218s internal registers may beaccessed. These registers allow the user to read the current\ntemperature from both the local (ambient) and remote channels,\nchange the configuration settings and adjust each channels limits.\nAn ALERT\n output signals when the on −chip or remote temperatures\nare out of range. The THERM  output is a comparator output that can\nbe used to shut down the system if it exceeds the programmed limit.The ALERT\n output can be reconfigured as a second THERM  output, if\nrequired.\nFeatures\n•Small DFN Package\n•On−Chip and Remote Temperature Sensor\n•Low V oltage Operation: 1.4 V to 2.75 V\n•Low Quiescent Current:\n♦44 /C0109A Normal Mode (max)\n♦20 /C0109A Shutdown (max)\n•Power Saving Shutdown Mode\n•Operating Temperature Range of −40°C to 125 °C\n•Series Resistance Cancellation up to 500 /C0087\n•Low D− bias for Operation with Low V oltage Processors\n•2−wire I2C Serial Interface\n•Programmable Over/Undertemperature Limits\n•These are Pb −Free Devices\nApplications\n•Smart Phones, Tablet PCs, Satellite Navigation, Smart BatteriesSee detailed ordering and shipping information on page 16 of\nthis data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATIONMARKING\nDIAGRAMS\nPIN ASSIGNMENTSDFN8\nMT SUFFIX\nCASE 511BU\nM = Date Code\nAY = Assembly year\nWW = Work Week\n/C0071 = Pb−Free DeviceT2 M /C0071\n/C00711\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)\nSCL\nSDA\nGNDALERT /THERM2\nTHERMD−D+VDD\nDFN8\n(Top View)1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5\nC1\nC2\nC3A1\nA2\nA3B1\nB3VDDTHERM2D+\nD−ALERT /\nTHERM2SDA\nGND\nSCL\nWLCSP8\n(Top View)WLCSP8\nCASE 567DHNCT218\nAYWW\nNCT218\nwww. onsemi.com\n2Figure 1.

The analog input\nmultiplexer alternately selects either the on −chip\ntemperature sensor to measure its local temperature or theremote temperature sensor. The ADC digitizes these signals\nand the results are stored in the local and remote temperaturevalue registers.\nThe local and remote measurement results are compared\nwith the corresponding high, low, and THERM\n temperature\nlimits, stored in eight on −chip registers. Out −of−limit\ncomparisons generate flags that are stored in the statusregister. A result that exceeds the high temperature limit orthe low temperature limit causes the ALERT\n output to\nassert. The ALERT  output also asserts if an external diode\nfault is detected. Exceeding the THERM  temperature limits\ncauses the THERM  output to assert low. The ALERT  output\ncan be reprogrammed as a second THERM  output.\nThe limit registers are programmed and the device\ncontrolled and configured via the serial I2C. The contents of\nany register are also read back via the I2C. Control and\nconfiguration functions consist of switching the devicebetween normal operation and standby mode, selecting thetemperature measurement range, masking or enabling theALERT\n output, switching Pin 6 between ALERT  and\nTHERM2 , and selecting the conversion rate.\nSeries Resistance Cancellation\nParasitic resistance to the D+ and D − inputs to the\nNCT218, seen in series with the remote diode, is caused by\na variety of factors, including PCB track resistance and tracklength. This series resistance appears as a temperature ofset\nin the remote sensor’s temperature measurement. This error\ntypically causes a 0.5 °C offset per ohm of parasitic\nresistance in series with the remote diode.\nThe NCT218 automatically cancels the effect of this\nseries resistance on the temperature reading, giving a moreaccurate result, without the need for user characterization of\nthis resistance. The NCT218 is designed to automatically\ncancel typically up to 150 /C0087 of resistance. By using an\nadvanced temperature measurement method, this process is\ntransparent to the user. This feature permits resistances to be\nadded to the sensor path to produce a filter, allowing the partto be used in noisy environments. See the section on NoiseFiltering for more details.Temperature Measurement Method\nA simple method of measuring temperature is to exploit\nthe negative temperature coefficient of a diode, measuringthe base emitter voltage (V\nBE) of a transistor operated at\nconstant current. However, this technique requirescalibration to null the effect of the absolute value of V\nBE,\nwhich varies from device to device.\nThe technique used in the NCT218 measures the change\nin VBE when the device operates at three different currents.\nPrevious devices used only two operating currents, but it is\nthe use of a third current that allows automatic cancellationof resistances in series with the external temperature sensor.\nFigure 4 shows the input signal conditioning used tomeasure the output of an external temperature sensor. This\nfigure shows the external sensor as a substrate transistor, but\nit can equally be a discrete transistor. If a discrete transistoris used, the collector is no t grounded b ut is linked to the base.\nTo prevent ground noise interfering with the measurement,the more negative terminal of the sensor is not referenced toground, but is biased above ground by an internal resistor at\nthe D− input. C1 may be added as a noise filter (a\nrecommended maximum value of 1000 pF). However, a\nbetter option in noisy environments is to add a filter, as\ndescribed in the Noise Filtering section. See the LayoutConsiderations section for more information on C1.\nTo measure /C0068V\nBE, the operating current through the\nsensor is switched among three related currents. As shownin Figure 4, N1 x I and N2 x I are different multiples of thecurrent, I. The currents through the temperature diode are\nswitched between I and N1 x I, giving /C0068V\nBE1; and then\nbetween I and N2 x I, giving /C0068VBE2. The temperature is then\ncalculated using the two /C0068VBE measurements. This method\nalso cancels the effect of any series resistance on thetemperature measurement.\nThe resulting /C0068V\nBE waveforms are passed through a\n65 kHz low −pass filter to remove noise and then to a\nchopper−stabilized amplifier. This amplifies and rectifies\nthe waveform to produce a dc voltage proportional to /C0068VBE.\nThe ADC digitizes this voltage producing a temperature\nmeasurement. To red uce the effects of noise, digital filtering\nis performed by averaging the results of 16 measurementcycles for low conversion rates. At rates of 16 −, 32− and\n64−conversions/second, no digital averaging occurs. Signal\nconditioning and measurement of the internal temperaturesensor are performed in the same manner.\nNCT218\nwww. onsemi.com\n6Figure 4.

It is only necessary in noisy environments. C1 = 1000 pF max.\nTemperature Measurement Results\nThe results of the local and remote temperature\nmeasurements are stored in the local and remote temperature\nvalue registers and compared with limits programmed intothe local and remote high and low limit registers.\nThe local temperature value is in Register 0x00 and has a\nresolution of 1 °C. The external temperature value is stored\nin two registers, with the upper byte in Register 0x01 and thelower byte in Register 0x10. Only the two MSBs in theexternal temperature low byte are used giving the externaltemperature measurement a resolution of 0.25 °C. Table 5\nlists the data format for the external temperature low byte.\nTable 5. EXTENDED TEMPERATURE RESOLUTION\n(Remote Temperature Low Byte)\nExtended ResolutionRemote Temperature\nLow Byte\n0.00 °C 0 000 0000\n0.25 °C 0 100 0000\n0.50 °C 1 000 0000\n0.75 °C 1 100 0000\nWhen reading the full external temperature value, read the\nLSB first. This causes the MSB to be locked (that is, the\nADC does not write to it) until it is read. This feature ensures\nthat the results read back from the two registers come fromthe same measurement.\nTemperature Measurement Range\nThe temperature measurement range for both internal and\nexternal measurements is, by default, 0 °C to +127 °C.\nHowever, the NCT218 can be operated using an extendedtemperature range. The extended measurement range is−64°C to +191 °C. Therefore, the NCT218 can be used to\nmeasure the full temperature range of an external diode,from −55°C to +150 °C.The extended temperature range is selected by setting\nBit 2 of the configuration register to 1. The temperaturerange is 0 °C to 127 °C when Bit 2 equals 0. A valid result is\navailable in the next measurement cycle after changing the\ntemperature range.\nIn extended temperature mode, the upper and lower\ntemperature that can be measured by the NCT218 is limited\nby the remote diode selection. The temperature registers canhave values from −64°C to +191 °C. However, most\ntemperature sensing diodes have a maximum temperaturerange of −55°C to +150 °C. Above +150 °C, they may lose\ntheir semiconductor characteristics and approximate\nconductors instead. This results in a diode short. In this case,\na read of the temperature result register gives the last goodtemperature measurement. Therefore, the temperaturemeasurement on the external channel may not be accuratefor temperatures that are outside the operating range of theremote sensor.\nIt should be noted that although both local and remote\ntemperature measurements can be made while the part is in\nextended temperature mode, the NCT218 itself should notbe exposed to temperatures greater than those specified inthe absolute maximum ratings section. Further, the device is\nonly guaranteed to operate as specified at ambienttemperatures from −40°C to +125 °C.\nTemperature Data Format\nThe NCT218 has two temperature data formats. When the\ntemperature measurement range is from 0 °C to 127 °C\n(default), the temperature data format for both internal andexternal temperature results is binary. When themeasurement range is in extended mode, an offset binarydata format is used for both internal and external results.\nTemperature values are offset by 64 °C in the offset binary\ndata format. Examples of temperatures in both data formats\nare shown in Table 6.\nNCT218\nwww. onsemi.com\n7Table 6.

Offset binary scale temperature values are offset by\n64°C.\n2. Binary scale temperature measurement returns 0 °C for all\ntemperatures < 0 °C.\n3. Binary scale temperature measurement returns 127 °C for\nall temperatures > 127 °C.\nThe user can switch between measurement ranges at any\ntime. Switching the range likewise switches the data format.\nThe next temperature result following the switching isreported back to the register in the new format. However, the\ncontents of the limit registers do not change. It is up to the\nuser to ensure that when the data format changes, the limitregisters are reprogrammed as necessary . More information\non this is found in the Limit Registers section.\nNCT218 Registers\nThe NCT218 contains 22, 8 −bit registers in total. These\nregisters store the results of remote and local temperaturemeasurements, high and low temperature limits, andconfigure and control the device. See the Address PointerRegister section through the Consecutive ALERT\n Register\nsection of this data sheet for more information on the NCT218registers. Additional details are shown in Table 7 throughTable 11. The entire register map is available in Table 12.\nAddress Pointer Register\nThe address pointer register itself does not have, nor does\nit require, an address because the first byte of every writeoperation is automatically written to this register. The data\nin this first byte always contains the address of another\nregister on the NCT218 that is stored in the address pointer\nregister. It is to this register address that the second byte ofa write operation is written, or to which a subsequent readoperation is performed.\nThe power −on default value of the address pointer register\nis 0x00. Therefore, if a read operation is performedimmediately after power −on, without first writing to the\naddress pointer, the value of the local temperature is returned\nbecause its register address is 0x00.Temperature Value Registers\nThe NCT218 has three registers to store the results of local\nand remote temperature measurements. These registers canonly be written to by the ADC and can be read by the userover the I\n2C. The local temperature value register is at\nAddress 0x00.\nThe external temperature value high byte register is at\nAddress 0x01, with the low byte register at Address 0x10.The power −on default for all three registers is 0x00.\nConfiguration Register\nThe configuration register is Address 0x03 at read and\nAddress 0x09 at write. Its power −on default is 0x00. Only four\nbits of the configuration register are used. Bit 0, Bit 1, Bit 3,\nand Bit 4 are reserved; only zeros should be written to these.\nBit 7 of the configuration register masks the ALERT\noutput. If Bit 7 is 0, the ALERT  output is enabled. This is the\npower−on default. It Bit 7 is set to 1, the ALERT  output is\ndisabled. This applies only if Pin 6 is configured as ALERT .\nIf Pin 6 is configured as THERM2 , then the value of Bit 7\nhas no effect.\nIf Bit 6 is set to 0, which is power −on default, the device\nis in operating mode with ADC converting. If Bit 6 is set to1, the device is in standby mode and the ADC does notconvert. The I\n2C does, however, remain active in standby\nmode; therefore, values can be read from or written to theNCT218 via the I\n2C. The ALERT  and THERM  output are\nalso active in standby mode. Changes made to the register in\nstandby mode that affect the THERM  or ALERT  outputs\ncause these signals to be updated.\nBit 5 determines the configuration of Pin 6 on the\nNCT218. If Bit 5 is 0 (default), then Pin 6 is configured asa ALERT\n output. If Bit 5 is 1, then Pin 6 is configured as a\nTHERM2  output. Bit 7, the ALERT  mask bit, is only active\nwhen Pin 6 is configured as an ALERT  output. If Pin 6 is set\nup as a THERM2  output, then Bit 7 has no effect.\nBit 2 sets the temperature measurement range. If Bit 2 is\n0 (default value), the temperature measurement range is setbetween 0 °C to +127 °C. Setting Bit 2 to 1 sets the\nmeasurement range to the extended temperature range(−64°C to +191 °C).\nTable 7.

The lowest four bits of this registerare used to program the conversion rate by dividing theinternal oscillator clock by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,512, 1024 to give conversion times from 15.5 ms (Code\n0x0A) to 16 seconds (Code 0x00). For example, a\nconversion rate of eight conversions per second means that\nbeginning at 125 ms intervals, the device performs aconversion on the internal and the external temperaturechannels.\nThe conversion rate register can be written to and read\nback over the I\n2C. The higher four bits of this register are\nunused and must be set to 0. The default value of this register\nis 0x08, giving a rate of 16 conversions per second. Use of\nslower conversion times greatly reduces the device powerconsumption.\nTable 8.

The remote temperature highand low limits span two registers each, to contain an upperand lower byte for each limit. There is also a THERM\nhysteresis register. All limit registers can be written to, and\nread byck over I2C. See Table 12 for details of the limit\nregister addresses and their power −on default values.\nWhen Pin 6 is configured as an ALERT  output, the high\nlimit registers perform a > comparison, while the low limitregisters perform a ≤ comparison. For example, if the high\nlimit register is programmed with 80 °C, then measuring\n81°C results in an out −of−limit condition, setting a flag in\nthe status register. If the low limit register is programmed\nwith 0 °C, measuring 0 °C or lower resutls in an out −of−limit\ncondition.\nExceeding either the local or remote THERM\n limit asserts\nTHERM  low. When Pin 6 is configured as THERM2 ,\nexceeding either the local or remote high limit assertsTHERM2\n low. A default hysteresis value of 10 °C isprovided which applies to both THERM  channels. This\nhysteresis value can be reprogrammed to any value afterpowerup (Register Address 0x21).\nIt is important to remember that the temperature limits\ndata format is the same as the temperature measurement data\nformat. Therefore, if the temperature measurement usesdefault binary, then the temperature limits also use thebinary scale. If the temperature measurement scale isswitched, however, the temperature limits do notautomatically switch. The user must reprogram the limitregisters to the desired value in the correct data format. For\nexample, if the remote low limit is set at 10 °C with the\ndefault binary scale, the limit register value is 0000 1010b.If the scale is switched to offset binary, the value in the lowtemperature limit register needs to be reprogrammed to0100 1010b.\nStatus Register\nThe status register is a read −only register at Address 0x02.\nIt contains status information for the NCT218. When Bit 7of the status register is high, it indicates that the ADC is bisyconverting. The other bits in this register flag theout−of−limit temperature measurements (Bit 6 to Bit 3, and\nBit 1 to Bit 0) and the remote sensor open circuit (Bit 2).\nIf Pin 6 is configured as an ALERT\n output, the following\napplies: If the local temperature measurement exceeds its\nlimits, Bit 6 (high limit) or Bit 5 (low limit) of the statusregister asserts to flag this condition. If the remotetemperature measurement exceeds its limits, then Bit 4 (high\nlimit) or Bit 3 (low limit) asserts. Bit 2 asserts to flag an open\ncircuit condition on the remote sensor. These five flags areNOR’ed together, so if any of them is high, the ALERT\ninterrupt latch is set and the ALERT output goes low.\nReading the status register clears the five flags, Bit 6 to\nBit 2, provided the error conditions causing the flags to beset have gone away. A flag bit can be reset only if thecorresponding value register contains an in −limit\nmeasurement or if the sensor is good.\nThe ALERT\n interrupt latch (output) is reset by either\nreading the status register or by issuing the device with anARA. In order for either of the above to work the error\ncondition must have gone away.\nWhen Flag 1 and/or Flag 0 are set, the THERM\n output\ngoes low to indicate that the temperature measurements areoutside the programmed limits. The THERM\n output does\nnot need to be reset, unlike the ALERT  output. Once the\nmeasurements are within the limits, the corresponding status\nregister bits are automatically reset and the THERM  output\ngoes high. The user may add hysteresis by programming\nRegister 0x21. The THERM  output is reset only when the\ntemperature falls to limit value minus the hysteresis value.\nWhen Pin 6 is configured as THERM2 , only the high\ntemperature limits are relevant. If Flag 6 and/or Flag 4 areset, the THERM2\n output goes low to indicate that the\ntemperature measurements are outside the programmedlimits. Flag 5 and Flag 3 have no effect on THERM2\n. The\nbehavior of THERM2  is otherwise the same as THERM .\nNCT218\nwww. onsemi.com\n9Table 9.

These flags stay high until the status register is read or\nthey are reset by POR unless Pin 6 is configured asTHERM2\n. Then, only Bit 2 remains high until the status\nregister is read or is reset by POR.\nOffset Register\nOffset errors can be introduced into the remote temperature\nmeasurement by clock noise or when the thermal diode is\nlocated away from the hot spot. To achieve the specifiedaccuracy on this channel, these offsets must be removed.\nThe offset register can also be used to nullify the effect of\nvarying nf, the non −ideality factor of the remote sensing\ndiode. By default the NCT218 is trimmed to operate with an\nnf value of 1.008 but the offset register allows other diodesto be used without affecting the temperature result.\nThe offset value is stored as a 10 −bit, twos complement\nvalue in Register 0x11 (high byte) and Register 0x12 (lowbyte, left justified). Only the upper two bits of Register 0x12\nare used. The MSB of Register 0x11 is the sign bit. Theminimum, programmable offset is −128°C, and the\nmaximum is +127.75 °C. The value in the offset register is\nadded to, or subtracted from, the measured value of theremote temperature.\nThe offset register powers up with a default value of 0 °C\nand has no effect unless the user  writes a different value to it.Table 10.

Writing to theone−shot register address (0x0F) causes the NCT218 to\nperform a conversion and comparison on both the internaland the external temperature channels. This is not a dataregister as such, and it is the write operation to Address 0x0F\nthat causes the one −shot conversion. The data written to this\naddress is irrelevant and is not stored.\nConsecutive ALERT  Register\nThe value written to this register determines how many\nout−of−limit measurements must occur before an ALERT  is\ngenerated. The default value is that one out −of−limit\nmeasurement generates an ALERT . The maximum value\nthat can be chosen is 4. The purpose of this register is toallow the user to perform some filtering of the output. Thisis particularly useful at the fastest three conversion rates,where no averaging takes place. This register is at Address0x22.\nTable 11.

The NCT218 is connected to this\nbus as a slave device, under the control of a master device.\nThe NCT218 has a bus timeout feature. When this is\nenabled, the bus times out after typically 25 ms of noactivity. After this time, the NCT218 resets the SDA lineback to its idle state (high impedance) and waits for the next\nstart condition. However, this feature is not enabled bydefault. Bit 7 of the consecutive alert register (Address =0x22) should be set to enable it.\nAddressing the Device\nIn general, every I2C device has a 7 −bit device address,\nexcept for some devices that have extended 10 −bit\naddresses. When the master device sends a device addressover the bus, the slave device with that address responds.\nThe NCT218 is available with one device address, 0x4C.\nThe serial bus protocol operates as follows:\n1. The master initiates data transfer by establishing a\nstart condition, defined as a high to low transitionon the serial data line SDA, while the serial clockline SCL remains high. This indicates that anaddress/data stream is going to follow. All slaveperipherals connected to the serial bus respond to\nthe start condition and shift in the next eight bits,\nconsisting of a 7 −bit address (MSB first) plus a\nread/write (R/W) bit, which deternimes thedirection of the data transfer i.e. whether data iswritten to, or read from, the slave device. Theperipheral with the address corresponding to thetransmitted address responds by pulling the dataline low during the low period before the ninth\nclock pulse, known as the acknowledge bit. All\nother devices on the bus now remain idle while theselected device waits for data to be read from orwritten to it. If the R/W bit is a zero then themaster writes to the slave device. If the R/W bit isa one then the master reads from the slave device.\n2. Data is sent over the serial bus in sequences of\nnine clock pulses, eight bits of data followed by an\nacknowledge bit from the receiver of data.\nTransitions on the data line must occur during thelow period of the clock signal and remain stableduring the high period, since a low −to−high\ntransition when the clock is high can be interpretedas a stop signal.\n3. When all data bytes have been read or written,\nstop conditions are established. In write mode, the\nmaster pulls the data line high during the tenth\nclock pulse to assert a stop condition. In readmode, the master overrides the acknowledge bit bypulling the data line high during the low periodbefore the ninth clock pulse. This is known as no\nacknowledge. The master takes the data line lowduring the low period before the tenth clock pulse,\nthen high during the tenth clock pulse to assert a\nstop condition.\nTo write data to one of the device data registers, or to read\ndata from it, the address pointer register must be set so thatthe correct data register is addressed. The first byte of a write\noperation always contains a valid address that is stored in theaddress pointer register. If data is to be written to the device,\nthe write operation contains a second data byte that is written\nto the register selected by the address pointer register.\nThis procedure is illustrated in Figure 5. The device\naddress is sent over the bus followed by R/W set to 0. Thisis followed by two data bytes. The first data byte is theaddress of the internal data register to be written to, whichis stored in the address pointer register. The second data byte\nis the data to be written to the internal data register.\nWhen reading data from a register there are two\npossibilities.\n•If the address pointer register value of the NCT218 is\nunknown or not the desired value, it is first necessary to\nset it to the correct value before data can be read from\nthe desired data register. This is done by writing to the\nNCT218 as before, but only the data byte containingthe register read address is sent, because data is not to\nbe written to the register see Figure 5.\nA read operation is then performed consisting of theserial bus address, R/W bit set to 1, followed by the\ndata byte read from the data register see Figure 7.\n•If the address pointer register is known to be at the\ndesired address, data can be read from the\ncorresponding data register without first writing to the\naddress pointer register and the bus transaction shown\nin Figure 6 can be omitted.\nNotes:\n•It is possible to read a data byte from a data register\nwithout first writing to the address pointer register.\nHowever, if the address pointer register is already at the\ncorrect value, it is not possible to write data to a register\nwithout writing to the address pointer register becausethe first data byte of a write is always written to the\naddress pointer register.\n•Some of the registers have different addresses for read\nand write operations. The write address of a register\nmust be written to the address pointer if data is to bewritten to that register, but it may not be possible to\nread data from that address. The read address of a\nregister must be written to the address pointer beforedata can be read from that register.\nNCT218\nwww. onsemi.com\n12Figure 5.

The ALERT  output goes low whenever an\nout−of−limit measurement is detected, or if the remote\ntemperature sensor is open circuit. It is an open −drain output\nand requires a pullup resistor to V DD. Several ALERT\noutputs can be wire −OR’ed together, so that the common\nline goes low if one or more of the ALERT  outputs goes low.\nThe ALERT  output can be used as an interrupt signal to a\nprocessor, or as an SMBALERT . Slave devices on the bus\ncannot normally signal to the bus master that they want totalk, but the SMBALERT\n function allows them to do so.\nOne or more ALERT  outputs can be connected to a\ncommon SMBALERT  line that is connected to the master.\nWhen the SMBALERT  line is pulled low by one of the\ndevices, the following procedure occurs (see Figure 8):Figure 8. Use of SMBALERTALERT RESPONSE\nADDRESS\nMASTER SENDS\nARA AND READ\nCOMMANDDEVICE SENDS\nITS ADDRESSRD START ACKDEVICE\nADDRESSNO\nACKSTOPMASTER RECEIVES SMBALERT\n1. SMBALERT  is pulled low.\n2. Master initiates a read operation and sends the\nalert response address (ARA = 0001 100). This isa general call address that must not be used as a\nspecific device address.\n3. The device whose ALERT\n output is low responds\nto the alert response address and the master readsits device address. As the device address is sevenbits, an LSB of 1 is added. The address of thedevice is now known and it can be interrogated inthe usual way.\n4. If more than one device’s ALERT\n output is low,\nthe one with the lowest device address takes\nNCT218\nwww. onsemi.com\n13priority, in accordance with normal bus arbitration.\nOnce the NCT218 has responded to the alertresponse address, it resets its ALERT\n output,\nprovided that the error condition that caused the\nALERT  no longer exists. If the SMBALERT  line\nremains low, the master sends the ARA again, andso on until all devices whose ALERT\n outputs were\nlow have responded.\nLow Power Standby Mode\nThe NCT218 can be put into low power standby mode by\nsetting Bit 6 of the configuration register. When Bit 6 is low,\nthe NCT218 operates normally. When Bit 6 is high, the ADC\nis inhibited, and any conversion in progress is terminatedwithout writing the result to the corresponding valueregister. However, the I\n2C is still enabled. Power\nconsumption in the standby mode is reduced to 12 /C0109A if\nthere is no bus activity.\nWhen the device is in standby mode, it is possible to\ninitiate a one −shot conversion of both channels by writing to\nthe one−shot register (Address 0x0F), after which the device\nreturns to standby. It does not matter what is written to theone−shot register, all data written to it is ignored. It is also\npossible to write new values to the limit register while instandby mode. If the values stored in the temperature value\nregisters are outside the new limits, an ALERT\n is generated,\neven though the NCT218 is still in standby.\nSensor Fault Detection\nAt its D+ input, the NCT218 contains internal sensor fault\ndetection circuitry. This circuit can detect situations where\nan external remote diode is either not connected orincorrectly connected to the NCT218. A simple voltagecomparator trips if the voltage at D+ exceeds VDD −\n300 mV (typical), signifying an open circuit between D+and D−. The output of this comparator is checked when a\nconversion is initiated. Bit 2 of the status register (open flag)\nis set if a fault is detected. If the ALERT\n pin is enabled,\nsetting this flag causes ALERT  to assert low.\nIf the user does not wish to use an external sensor with the\nNCT218, tie the D+ and D − inputs together to prevent\ncontinuous setting of the open flag.\nThe NCT218 Interrupt System\nThe NCT218 has two interrupt outputs, ALERT  and\nTHERM . Both have different functions and behavior.\nALERT  is maskable and responds to violations of software\nprogrammed temperature limits or an open −circuit fault on\nthe external diode. THERM  is intended as a fail −safe\ninterrupt output that cannot be masked.\nIf the external or local temperature exceeds the\nprogrammed high temperature limits, or equals or exceeds\nthe low temperature limits, the ALERT  output is asserted\nlow. An open −circuit fault on the external diode also causes\nALERT  to assert. ALERT  is reset when serviced by a master\nreading its device address, provided the error condition has\ngone away and the status register has been reset.The THERM  output asserts low if the external or local\ntemperature exceeds the programmed THERM  limits.\nTHERM  temperature limits should normally be equal to or\ngreater than the high temperature limits. THERM  is reset\nautomatically when the temperature falls back within theTHERM\n limit. A hysteresis value can be programmed; in\nwhich case, THERM  resets when the temperature falls to the\nlimit value minus the hysteresis value. This applies to bothlocal and remote measurement channels. The power −on\nhysteresis default value is 10 °C, but this can be\nreprogrammed to any value after powerup.\nThe hysteresis loop on the THERM\n outputs is useful when\nTHERM  is used, for example, as an on/off controller for a\nfan. The user’s system can be set up so that when THERM\nasserts, a fan is switched on to cool the system. WhenTHERM\n goes high again, the fan can be switched off.\nProgramming a hysteresis value protects from fan jitter,where the temperature hovers around the THERM\n limit, and\nthe fan is constantly switched.\nTable 13.

The ALERT  output can be used as a SMBALERT\nto signal to the host via the I2C that the temperature has risen.\nThe user can use the THERM  output to turn on a fan to cool\nthe system, if the temperature continues to increase. Thismethod ensures that there is a fail −safe mechanism to cool\nthe system, without the need for host intervention.\nFigure 9.

The THERM2  output is used to turn on a\nfan. If the temperature continues to rise and exceeds theTHERM\n limits, the THERM  output provides additional\ncooling by throttling the CPU.\nFigure 10.

Although this\ncapacitor reduces the noise, it does not eliminate it, making\nit difficult to use the sensor in a very noisy environment.\nThe NCT218 has a major advantage over other devices\nwhen it comes to eliminating the effects of noise on theexternal sensor. The series resistance cancellation featureallows a filter to be constructed between the externaltemperature sensor and the part. The effect of any filterresistance seen in series with the remote sensor is\nautomatically cancelled from the temperature result.\nThe construction of a filter allows the NCT218 and the\nremote temperature sensor to operate in noisy environments.\nFigure 11 shows a low −pass R−C−R filter, where R = 100 /C0087\nand C = 1 nF . This filtering reduces both common−mode and\ndifferential noise.\nFigure 11. Filter Between Remote Sensor and\nNCT218 Factors Affecting Diode Accuracy100 /C0087\n100 /C00871 nFD+\nD−REMOTE\nTEMPERATURE\nSENSOR\nRemote Sensing Diode\nThe NCT218 is designed to work with substrate\ntransistors built into processors or with discrete transistors.Substrate transistors are generally PNP types with thecollector connected to the substrate. Discrete types are either\nPNP or NPN transistors connected as diodes (base −shorted\nto collector). If an NPN transistor is used, the collector and\nbase are connected to D+ and the emitter to D −. If a PNP\ntransistor is used, the collector and base are connected to D −\nand the emitter to D+.\nTo reduce the error due to variations in both substrate and\ndiscrete transistors, consider several factors:\n•The ideality factor, nF, of the transistor is a measure of\nthe deviation of the thermal diode from ideal behavior.\nThe NCT218 is trimmed for an nF value of 1.008. The\nfollowing equation may be used to calculate the errorintroduced at a temperature, T ( °C), when using a\ntransistor whose nF does not equal 1.008. Consult the\nprocessor data sheet for the nF values.\n/C0068T/C0043(nF/C00421.008)/C03241.008/C0032(273.15 Kelvin /C0041T)\nNCT218\nwww. onsemi.com\n15To factor this in, the user writes the /C0068T value to the ofset\nregister. It is then automatically added to, or subtracted from,\nthe temperature measurement.\n•Some CPU manufacturers specify the high and low\ncurrent levels of the substrate transistors. The high\ncurrent level of the NCT218, I HIGH , is 200 /C0109A, IMID is\n75 /C0109A and the low level current, ILOW, is 12.5 /C0109A. If\nthe NCT218 current levels do not match the currentlevels specified by the CPU manufacturer, it may\nbecome necessary to remove an offset. The CPU data\nsheet should advise whether this offset needs to beremoved and how to calculate it. This offset is\nprogrammed to the ofset register. It is important to note\nthat if more than one offset must be considered, thealgebraic sum of these offsets must be programmed to\nthe offset register.\nThermal Inertia and Self −Heating\nAccuracy depends on the temperature of the remote\nsensing diode and/or the internal temperature sensor being\nat the same temperature as that being measured. Many\nfactors can affect this. Ideally, place the sensor in goodthermal contact with the part of the system being measured.\nIf it is not, the thermal inertia caused by the sensor’s masscauses a lag in the response of the sensor to a temperaturechange. In the case of the remote sensor, this should not bea problem since it is either a substrate transistor in theprocessor or a small package device, such as the SOT −23,\nplaced in close proximity to it. The on −chip sensor, however,\nis often remote from the processor and only monitors thegeneral ambient temperature around the package. Howaccurately the temperature of the board and/or the forcedairflow reflects the temperature to be measured dictates the\naccuracy of the measurement. Self −heating due to the power\ndissipated in the NCT218 or the remote sensor causes thechip temperature of the device or remote sensor to rise above\nambient. However, the current forced through the remote\nsensor is so small that self −heating is negligible.\nLayout Considerations\nDigital boards can be electrically noisy environments, and\nthe NCT218 is measuring very small voltages from the\nremote sensor, so care must be taken to minimize noiseinduced at the sensor inputs. T ake the following precautions:\n•Place the NCT218 as close as possible to the remote\nsensing diode. Provided that the worst noise sources,\nthat is, clock generators, data/address buses, and CRTsare avoided, this distance can be 4 inches to 8 inches.\n•Route the D+ and D– tracks close together, in parallel,\nwith grounded guard tracks on each side. To minimize\ninductance and reduce noise pickup, a 5 mil track widthand spacing is recommended. Provide a ground plane\nunder the tracks, if possible.\nFigure 12. Typical Assignment of Signal Tracks5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL\nGNDD−D+GND\n•Try to minimize the number of copper/solder joints that\ncan cause thermocouple effects. Where copper/solder\njoints are used, make sure that they are in both the D+and D− path and at the same temperature.\n•Thermocouple effects should not be a major problem as\n1°C corresponds to about 200 mV , and thermocouple\nvoltages are about 3 mV/ °C of temperature difference.\nUnless there are two thermocouples with a big\ntemperature differential between them, thermocouple\nvoltages should be much less than 200 mV .\n•Place a 0.1 /C0109F bypass capacitor close to the VDD pin.\nIn extremely noisy environments, place an input filter\ncapacitor across D+ and D − close to the NCT218. This\ncapacitance can effect the temperature measurement, soensure that any capacitance seen at D+ and D − is, at\nmaximum, 1,000 pF. This maximum value includes the\nfilter capacitance, plus any cable or stray capacitance\nbetween the pins and the sensor diode.\n•If the distance to the remote sensor is more than 8\ninches, the use of twisted pair cable is recommended. A\ntotal of 6 feet to 12 feet is needed. For really long\ndistances (up to 100 feet), use a shielded twisted pair,such as the Belden No. 8451 microphone cable.\nConnect the twisted pair to D+ and D − and the shield to\nGND close to the NCT218. Leave the remote end of theshield unconnected to avoid ground loops. Because the\nmeasurement technique uses switched current sources,\nexcessive cable or filter capacitance can affect the\nmeasurement. When using long cables, the filter\ncapacitance can be reduced or removed.\nPower Supply Rise Time\nWhen powering up the NCT218 you must ensure that the\npower supply voltage rises above 1.32 in less than 5 ms. If\na rise time of longer than this occurs then power-on-reset\nwill be caused and yield unpredictable results.\nNCT218\nwww. onsemi.com\n16Table 14.
