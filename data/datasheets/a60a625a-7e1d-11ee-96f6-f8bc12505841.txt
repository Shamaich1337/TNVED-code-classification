Inductance measured at 100kHz, 100mVrms.\n2. Inductance at Irated is the value of the inductance at 25°C at the listed rated current.\n3. The rated current as listed is either the saturation current (25°C or 100°C) or the heat -\ning current depending on which value is lower.\n4. The nominal DCR is measured at point 2., as shown below on the mechanical \ndrawing. \n5. The saturation current is the typical current which causes the inductance to drop by \n20% at the stated ambient temperatures (25°C, 100°C ). This current is determined by \nplacing the component in the specified ambient environment and applying a short \nduration pulse current (to eliminate self-heating effects) to the component.\n6. The heating current is the DC current which causes the part temperature to increase by \napproximately 40°C when used in a typical application. 7. In high volt*time applications, additional heating in the component can occur due \nto core losses in the inductor which may neccessitate derating the current in order \nto limit the temperature rise of the component. To determine the approximate total \nlosses (or temperature rise) for a given application, the coreloss and temperature rise \ncurves can be used.\n8.
