The storage register has parallel 3-state outputs. Separate clocks are provided for the shift and storage \nregisters. The shift register has a direct overriding clear ( SRCLR ) input, serial (SER) input, and serial outputs \nfor cascading. When the output-enable ( OE) input is high, the outputs are in the high-impedance state. Both the \nshift register clock (SRCLK) and storage register clock (RCLK) are positive-edge triggered. If both clocks are \nconnected together, then the shift register always is one clock pulse ahead of the storage register.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nRCLKOE\nSRCLR\nSRCLK\nSER13\n12\n10\n11\n14D\nR15\n1QA\nQB\nQCQ\nD\nRQD\nQ\nD\nQ\n2\nQD3\nQE4\nQF5\nQG6\nD\nR7\n9QH’QD\nQ QH\nFigure 8-1.

Driving high, driving low, and high impedance are the \nthree states that these outputs can be in. The term balanced  indicates that the device can sink and source \nsimilar currents. The drive capability of this device may create fast edges into light loads, so routing and load \nconditions should be considered to prevent ringing. Additionally, the outputs of this device can drive larger \ncurrents than the device can sustain without being damaged. It is important for the output power of the device \nto be limited to avoid damage due to overcurrent. The electrical and thermal limits defined in the Absolute \nMaximum Ratings  must be followed at all times.\nwww.ti.comSN74LV595A\nSCLS414T – APRIL 1998 – REVISED MARCH 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LV595A\nWhen placed into the high-impedance mode, the output will neither source nor sink current, with the exception of \nminor leakage current as defined in the Electrical Characteristics  table. In the high-impedance state, the output \nvoltage is not controlled by the device and is dependent on external factors. If no other drivers are connected \nto the node, then this is known as a floating node and the voltage is unknown. A pull-up or pull-down resistor \ncan be connected to the output to provide a known voltage at the output while it is in the high-impedance state. \nThe value of the resistor will depend on multiple factors, including parasitic capacitance and power consumption \nlimitations. Typically, a 10-kΩ resistor can be used to meet these requirements.\nUnused 3-state CMOS outputs should be left disconnected.\n8.3.2 Latching Logic\nThis device includes latching logic circuitry. Latching circuits commonly include D-type latches and D-type \nflip-flops, but include all logic circuits that act as volatile memory.\nWhen the device is powered on, the state of each latch is unknown. There is no default state for each latch at \nstart-up.\nThe output state of each latching logic circuit only remains stable as long as power is applied to the device within \nthe supply voltage range specified in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table.\n8.3.3 Partial Power Down (I off)\nThis device includes circuitry to disable all outputs when the supply pin is held at 0 V. When disabled, the \noutputs will neither source nor sink current, regardless of the input voltages applied. The amount of leakage \ncurrent at each output is defined by the I off specification in the Electrical Characteristics  table.\n8.3.4 Clamp Diode Structure\nFigure 8-2  shows the inputs and outputs to this device have negative clamping diodes only.\nCAUTION\nVoltages beyond the values specified in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  table can cause damage \nto the device. The input and output voltage ratings may be exceeded if the input and output clamp-\ncurrent ratings are observed.\nFigure 8-2.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN74LV595A is a low-drive CMOS device that can be used for a multitude of bus interface type applications \nwhere output ringing is a concern. The low drive and slow edge rates will minimize overshoot and undershoot on \nthe outputs. The inputs are 5-V tolerant allowing for down translation to V CC.\n9.2 Typical Application\nR1270\nR2270\nR3270\nR4270\nR5270\nR6270\nR7270\nR8270\nGNDLED1\nLED2\nLED3\nLED4\nLED5\nLED6\nLED7\nLED8\nGND GND GND GND GND GND GND GNDGND VCCµCVCC\nIC1VCC1K\nR914\n11\n10\n12\n13\n816\n15\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n9VCC\nOA\nOB\nOC\nOD\nOE\nOF\nOG\nOH\nGND\nSN74LV595A-Q1OERCLKSRCLRSRCLKSER\nOH*\nFigure 9-1.

The logic device can only source as much current that is \nprovided by the positive supply source. Be sure to not exceed the maximum total current through V CC listed in \nthe Absolute Maximum Ratings .SN74LV595A\nSCLS414T – APRIL 1998 – REVISED MARCH 2023\n www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LV595A\nThe ground must be capable of sinking current equal to the total current to be sunk by all outputs of the \nSN74LV595A  plus the maximum supply current, I CC, listed in the Electrical Characteristics , and any transient \ncurrent required for switching. The logic device can only sink as much current that can be sunk into its ground \nconnection. Be sure to not exceed the maximum total current through GND listed in the Absolute Maximum \nRatings .\nThe SN74LV595A  can drive a load with a total capacitance less than or equal to 50 pF while still meeting all of \nthe data sheet specifications. Larger capacitive loads can be applied; however, it is not recommended to exceed \n50 pF.\nThe SN74LV595A  can drive a load with total resistance described by R L ≥ VO / IO, with the output voltage and \ncurrent defined in the Electrical Characteristics  table with VOH and VOL. When outputting in the HIGH state, the \noutput voltage in the equation is defined as the difference between the measured output voltage and the supply \nvoltage at the V CC pin.\nTotal power consumption can be calculated using the information provided in CMOS Power Consumption and \nCpd Calculation .\nThermal increase can be calculated using the information provided in Thermal Characteristics of Standard Linear \nand Logic (SLL) Packages and Devices .\nCAUTION\nThe maximum junction temperature, T J(max)  listed in the Absolute Maximum Ratings , is an additional \nlimitation to prevent damage to the device. Do not violate any values listed in the Absolute Maximum \nRatings . These limits are provided to prevent damage to the device.\n9.2.2 Input Considerations\nInput signals must cross VIL(max)  to be considered a logic LOW, and VIH(min)  to be considered a logic HIGH. Do \nnot exceed the maximum input voltage range found in the  Absolute Maximum Ratings .\nUnused inputs must be terminated to either V CC or ground. The unused inputs can be directly terminated if the \ninput is completely unused, or they can be connected with a pull-up or pull-down resistor if the input will be used \nsometimes, but not always. A pull-up resistor is used for a default state of HIGH, and a pull-down resistor is used \nfor a default state of LOW. The drive current of the controller, leakage current into the SN74LV595A  (as specified \nin the Electrical Characteristics ), and the desired input transition rate limits the resistor size. A 10-k Ω resistor \nvalue is often used due to these factors.\nThe SN74LV595A  has CMOS inputs and thus requires fast input transitions to operate correctly, as defined in \nthe Recommended Operating Conditions  table. Slow input transitions can cause oscillations, additional power \nconsumption, and reduction in device reliability.\nRefer to the Feature Description  section for additional information regarding the inputs for this device.\n9.2.3 Output Considerations\nThe positive supply voltage is used to produce the output HIGH voltage. Drawing current from the output will \ndecrease the output voltage as specified by the V OH specification in the Electrical Characteristics . The ground \nvoltage is used to produce the output LOW voltage. Sinking current into the output will increase the output \nvoltage as specified by the V OL specification in the Electrical Characteristics .\nPush-pull outputs that could be in opposite states, even for a very short time period, should never be connected \ndirectly together. This can cause excessive current and damage to the device.\nTwo channels within the same device with the same input signals can be connected in parallel for additional \noutput drive strength.\nUnused outputs can be left floating. Do not connect outputs directly to V CC or ground.\nRefer to the Feature Description  section for additional information regarding the outputs for this device.\nwww.ti.comSN74LV595A\nSCLS414T – APRIL 1998 – REVISED MARCH 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LV595A\n9.2.4 Design Requirements\nThis device uses CMOS technology and has balanced output drive. Care should be taken to avoid bus \ncontention because it can drive currents that would exceed maximum limits. The high drive will also create \nfast edges into light loads so routing and load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing.\n9.2.5 Detailed Design Procedure\n1.Add a decoupling capacitor from V CC to GND. The capacitor needs to be placed physically close to the \ndevice and electrically close to both the V CC and GND pins. An example layout is shown in the Layout \nsection.\n2.Ensure the capacitive load at the output is ≤ 50 pF. This is not a hard limit; it will, however, ensure optimal \nperformance. This can be accomplished by providing short, appropriately sized traces from the SN74LV595A \nto one or more of the receiving devices.\n3.Ensure the resistive load at the output is larger than (V CC / IO(max) ) Ω. This will ensure that the maximum \noutput current from the Absolute Maximum Ratings  is not violated. Most CMOS inputs have a resistive load \nmeasured in MΩ; much larger than the minimum calculated previously.\n4.Thermal issues are rarely a concern for logic gates; the power consumption and thermal increase, however, \ncan be calculated using the steps provided in the application report, CMOS Power Consumption and Cpd \nCalculation .\n9.2.6 Application Curves\nQA\nQBSER\nQC\nQD\nQE\nQF\nQG\nQH\nQH¶Serial  Registers\nOutput  Registers\nSRCLK rising edge shifts data\nin the serial registers onlyQA\nQBSER\nQC\nQD\nQE\nQF\nQG\nQH\nQH¶Serial  Registers\nOutput  Registers\nRCLK rising edge shifts data\nto the output registers\nFigure 9-2. Simplified Functional Diagram Showing Clock Operation\n9.3 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe power supply can be any voltage between the MIN and MAX supply voltage rating located in the \nRecommended Operating Conditions  table.\nEach V CC terminal should have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. For devices with a \nsingle supply, a 0.1 μF capacitor is recommended. If there are multiple V CC terminals then 0.01 μF or 0.022 μF \ncapacitors are recommended for each power terminal. It is ok to parallel multiple bypass capacitors to reject \ndifferent frequencies of noise. 0.1 μF and 1.0 μ F capacitors are commonly used in parallel. The bypass capacitor \nshould be installed as close to the power terminal as possible for the best results.SN74LV595A\nSCLS414T – APRIL 1998 – REVISED MARCH 2023\n www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LV595A\n9.4 Layout\n9.4.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple bit logic devices, inputs should not float. In many cases, functions or parts of functions of \ndigital logic devices are unused. Some examples are when only two inputs of a triple-input AND gate are used, \nor when only 3 of the 4-buffer gates are used. Such unused input pins must not be left unconnected because \nthe undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. All unused inputs of \ndigital logic devices must be connected to a logic high or logic low voltage, as defined by the input voltage \nspecifications, to prevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular unused input \ndepends on the function of the device. Generally, the inputs are tied to GND or VCC, whichever makes more \nsense for the logic function or is more convenient.\n9.4.2 Layout Example\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n716\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10 \nQB\nQC\nQE\nQF\nQGGND V CC\nQA\nSER\nRCLK\nSRCLK\nSRCLR\nGNDVCC\nOEQD0.1 \x1dFBypass capacitor \nplaced close to \nthe device\nAvoid 90°  \ncorners for \nsignal linesRecommend GND  flood fill for \nimproved signal isolation, noise \nreduction, and thermal dissipation\nUnused output \nleft floatingUnused inputs tie to GND or V CC\nQH\nQH¶ 8 9\nFigure 9-3.
