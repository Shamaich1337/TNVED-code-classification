Life & Re-Ageing\nShelf Life \nSolderability is 12 months \nThe capacitance, ESR and impedance of a capacitor will not change significantly after extended storage periods, however the \nleakage current will slowly increase.\n• Thi\ns series should not be stored in high temperatures or where there is a high level of humidity. \n• The s\nuitable storage condition  is +5 to +35°C and less than 75% in relative humidity.\n• Do no\nt  store in damp conditions such as water, saltwater spray or oil spray.\n• Do no\nt store in an environment full of hazardous gas (hydrogen sulphide, sulphurous acid gas, nitrous acid, chlorine gas, \nammonium, etc.)\n• Do no\nt store under exposure to ozone, ultraviolet rays or radiation.\nIf a capacitor has been stored for more than 24 months under these conditions and it shows increased leakage current, \nthen a treatment by voltage application is recommended.\nRe-age Procedure\nApply the rated DC voltage to the capacitor at 125°C for a period of 120 minutes through a 1 kΩ series resistor.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nAll Part Numbers in this datasheet are Reach and RoHS compliant, and Halogen-Free. \nAs an environmentally conscious company, KEMET is working continuously with improvements concerning the environmental \neffects of both our capacitors and their production. In Europe (RoHS Directive) and in some other geographical areas like China, legislation has been put in place to prevent the use of some hazardous materials, such as lead (Pb), in electronic equipment. All products in this catalog are produced to help our customers' obligations to guarantee their products and fulfill these legislative requirements. The only material of concern in our products has been lead (Pb), which has been removed from all designs to fulfill the requirement of containing less than 0.1% of lead in any homogeneous material. KEMET will closely follow any changes in legislation worldwide and makes any necessary changes in its products, whenever needed.\nSome customer segments such as medical, military and automotive electronics may still require the use of lead in electrode \ncoatings.

The \nleakage current may increase after soldering or reflow soldering. Therefore, verify the suitability for use in circuits sensitive to leakage current.\nA general principle is that lower temperature operation results in a longer, useful life of the capacitor. For this reason, it \nshould be ensured that electrolytic capacitors are placed away from heat-emitting components. Adequate space should be allowed between components for cooling air to circulate, especially when high ripple current loads are applied. In any case, the maximum rated temperature must not be exceeded.\n•\n Do no\nt deform the case of capacitors or use capacitors with a deformed case.\n• Ver\nify that the connections of the capacitors are able to insert on the board without excessive mechanical force. \nExcessive force during insertion, as well as after soldering may cause terminal damage and affect the electrical \nperformance.\n• Ens\nure electrical insulation between the capacitor case, negative terminal, positive terminal and PCB.\n• If the c\napacitors require mounting through additional means, the recommended mounting accessories shall be used.\n• Ver\nify the correct polarization of the capacitor on the board.\nKEMET recommends, to ensure that the voltage across each capacitor does not exceed its rated voltage.\nTemperature Stability Characteristics\nStable characteristics in a very low temperature range allows for less circuits in the design.\nDue to a solid polymer electrolyte, Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors feature higher conductivity. This results in a lower \nESR which, coupled with high capacitance allows an aluminum polymer capacitor to replace several standard electrolytic capacitors, reducing the number of components and maximizing board space.\nThe ESR of polymer capacitors is nearly constant within its operating temperature range, while the ESR of a standard \nelectrolytic capacitor noticeably changes with temperature.\n0.010.11101001,000\nTemperature (°C)ESR (Ω)\n−20 0 20 70 105 125 −55Aluminum Electrolytic Conductive Polymer ElectrolyticTemperature Stability Characteristics\n11 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • KEMET Tower • One East Broward Boulevard  A40 72_A759 • 1/22/2021\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA759 125°CStability of ESR across Frequency Range\nDue to a solid polymer electrolyte, the ESR curve of a solid polymer aluminum capacitor, is lower and more stable than that \nof a standard electrolytic capacitor.\n0.010.1110100\nFrequency (Hz)ESR\n10K 100K 1M 10M 0Aluminum Electrolytic Conductive Polymer ElectrolyticStable ESR Values across Frequency\nHigh Resistance to Ripple Current\nAs a result of a lower ESR, solid polymer aluminum capacitors are able to withstand higher ripple currents during normal operation.\n00.511.522.533.54Ripple Current (Arms)\n33 µF/16 V 47 µF/16 V 100 µF/16 V 220 µF/16 VConductive Polymer ElectrolyticAluminum ElectrolyticAllowable Ripple Current (100 kHz 105°C)\n12 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • KEMET Tower • One East Broward Boulevard  A40 72_A759 • 1/22/2021\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA759 125°CMarking\nNegative \nPolarity\nBlue LineTrademark\nSeries\nRated\nVoltageCapacitanceDate Code*\n(Last 3 Digits)Date Code*\n1st Digits = Rated Voltage\nLetter = Year Code S = 2019\nFinal Digits = Week of the Year 01 = 1st week of the Year to  \n52 = 52nd week of the Year\nYear Code\nS 2019\nT 2020\nU 2021\nV 2022\nW 2023\nX 2024\nY 2025\nZ 2026\nNote: Sizes utilzing PET sleeve have printing on the sleeve rather than the top.

Both the anode and cathode foils are then interleaved with absorbent paper and wound into a cylinder. During the winding process, aluminum tabs are attached to each foil to provide the electrical contact.\nThe deck, complete with terminals, is attached to the tabs \nand then folded down to rest on top of the winding. The complete winding is impregnated with a conductive polymer electrolyte before being housed in a suitable container, usually an aluminum can, and sealed. Throughout the process, all materials inside the housing must be maintained at the highest purity and be compatible with the electrolyte.\nEach capacitor is aged and tested before being packed. \nThe purpose of aging is to repair any damage in the oxide layer and thus reduce the leakage current to a very low level. Aging is normally carried out at the rated temperature of the capacitor and is accomplished by applying voltage to the device while carefully controlling the supply current. The process may take several hours to complete. Damage to the oxide layer can occur due to variety of reasons:     • Slitting of the anode foil after forming     • Attaching the tabs to the anode foil     • Minor mechanical damage caused during winding \n16 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • KEMET Tower • One East Broward Boulevard  A40 72_A759 • 1/22/2021\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA759 125°CProduct Safety\nTHESE NOTES SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PRODUCT DATA SHEET. FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE RATINGS \nAND THE INFORMATION ON THIS SHEET MAY RESUL T IN A SAFETY HAZARD.\nWarning \nWhen potential lethal voltages e.g. 30 VAC (RMS) or 60 VDC are applied to the terminals of this product, the use of a hazard warning label is recommended.\n1. Electrolyte\nConductive polymer aluminum solid electrolytic capacitors contain polymers (electrolytes) which can be hazardous.\n1.1 Safety Precautions\nIn the event of gas venting, avoid contact and inhalation. Wash the affected area with hot water. Use rubber gloves to avoid skin contact. Any contact with the eyes should be liberally irrigated with water and medical advice sought. \n2. Intrinsic Properties2.1 Operating\nDC capacitors are polar devices and will operate safely only if correctly connected. Reversing the connections will result in high leakage currents which could subsequently cause short circuit failure and possibly explosion and fire. Correctly polarized operation may result in the above failure modes if:•\n The s\nurge voltage is exceeded\n• The a\nmbient temperature is too high\n• Exc\nessive ripple currents are applied\n2.2 Non-OperatingExcessive torque or soldering heat may affect the performance of the capacitor or damage the sealing. Electric shock may result if capacitors are not discharged.\n3. Disposal\nAluminum electrolytic capacitors are consignable waste under the Special Waste Regulations 1996 (Statutory Instrument 1996 No 972), which complies with the EC Hazardous Waste Directive – Directive 91/689/EEC. The electrolyte should therefore be treated as a hazardous waste and advice should be sought from the local office of the Environmental Agency regarding its disposal. \nDue to the construction of an aluminum electrolytic capacitors, high temperature incineration may cause the component to \nexplode due to build-up of internal pressure. In addition, incineration may also cause the emission of noxious fumes.KEMET strongly recommends that if there are any doubts regarding the disposal of conductive polymer aluminum solid electrolytic capacitors, that advice be sought from the local regulating authority.\nIn addition, KEMET would like to request that users of aluminum electrolytic capacitors respect the needs of the environment \nand, wherever possible, recover as much of the materials as possible, i.e., aluminum.\n17 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • KEMET Tower • One East Broward Boulevard  A40 72_A759 • 1/22/2021\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA759 125°CProduct Safety cont.\n4. Unsafe Use\nMost failures are of a passive nature and do not represent a safety hazard. A hazard may, however, arise if this failure causes a dangerous malfunction of the equipment in which the capacitor is employed. Circuits should be designed to fail safe under the normal modes of failure.The usual failure mode is an increase in leakage current or short circuit. Other possible modes are decrease of capacitance, increase in dissipation factor (and impedance) or an open circuit. Capacitors should be used in a well-ventilated enclosure or cabinet.\n5. Mounting\nCare should be taken when mounting by clamp so that any safety vent in the can is not covered.\n6. Fumigation\nIn many countries throughout the world it is now common practice to fumigate shipments of products in order to control insect infestation, particularly when wooden packaging is used. Currently, methyl bromide is widely used as a fumigant, which can penetrate cardboard packing and polymer bags and, therefore, come into direct contact with equipment or components contained within.   If aluminum electrolytic capacitors become exposed to methyl bromide, then corrosion may occur, depending upon the concentration and exposure time to the chemical.  This failure mode can affect all types of KEMET aluminum electrolytic capacitors. Methyl bromide can penetrate the seals of aluminum electrolytic capacitors and cause internal corrosion of the anode connection, resulting in the component becoming open circuit. The rate of corrosion will depend upon the level of exposure to methyl bromide as well as the subsequent operating conditions, such as voltage and temperature. It may take months or, in some cases, several years before the component becomes open circuit.\n7. Dielectric Absorption\nA phenomenon known as the dielectric absorption can cause aluminum electrolytic capacitors to recharge themselves. The phenomenon is well known but impossible to predict with any great accuracy, so potentially any electrolytic product could be affected. Thus, a capacitor that has been charged and then completely discharged will appear to recharge itself if left open circuit; this will manifest itself as a small voltage across the terminals of the capacitor. Generally, the voltages seen are less than 20 VDC, however, higher voltages have on occasion been reported.   In order to avoid any problems caused by this voltage, KEMET recommends that capacitors be discharged before connecting to the terminals.\n18 © KEMET Electronics Corporation • KEMET Tower • One East Broward Boulevard  A40 72_A759 • 1/22/2021\nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 USA • 954-766-2800 • www.kemet.com\nRadial Solid Polymer Aluminum Capacitors\nA759 125°CKEMET Electronics Corporation Sales Oﬃ   ces\nFor a complete list of our global sales offi   ces, please visit www.kemet.com/sales.\nDisclaimer\nAll product specifi  cations, statements, information and data (collectively, the “Information”) in this datasheet are subject to change.
