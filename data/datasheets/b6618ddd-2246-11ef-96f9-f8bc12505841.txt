Configured as a double-pole, double-throw (DPDT) \nswitch for data, FSA3000 is optimized for USB2.0 and \nMHL data sources .  \nThe FSA3000 contains circuitry on the switch I/O pin s \nthat allows the device to withstand an over-voltage  \ncondition in applications where the V CC supply is powered \noff (V CC=0). The FSA3000 minimizes current \nconsumption even when the voltage applied to the control \npins is lower than the supply voltage (V CC). This feature is \nespecially valuable in mobile applications, such as  cell \nphone s; allowing direct interface with the general-purpose \nI/Os of the baseband processor. Other applications \ninclude switching and connector sharing in portable  cell \nphones, digital cameras, and notebook computers. \n \nOrdering Information \nPart Number Top Mark Operating \nTemperature Range Package \nFSA3000L10X LK \n-40 to +85°C 10-Lead, MicroPakTM  1.6 x 2.1 mm JEDEC MO255B \nFSA3000L10X_F131 LK 10-Lead, MicroPakTM  1.6 x 2.1 mm JEDEC MO255B , \nPackage Rotated 90° in Tape and Reel \n \nFigure 1.

### Component Summary: FSA3000L10X

**Manufacturer:** ON Semiconductor (formerly Fairchild Semiconductor)

**Description:**
The FSA3000 is a bi-directional, low-power, two-port, high-speed switch designed for USB2.0 and video data applications. It supports the Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) Specification Rev. 2.0 and is configured as a double-pole, double-throw (DPDT) switch. The device is optimized for use in mobile applications, allowing for efficient switching between USB and MHL data sources.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VCC): 2.7 V to 4.3 V (Recommended Operating Conditions)
  - Absolute Maximum Supply Voltage: -0.5 V to 5.5 V
  - Switch I/O Voltage (USB): -0.5 V to 3.6 V
  - Switch I/O Voltage (MHL): 1.65 V to 3.45 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Quiescent Supply Current: 30 µA (maximum)
  - DC Output Current: 100 mA (maximum)

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Maximum quiescent supply current: 30 µA
  - Power-off leakage current: 500 nA (maximum)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +85 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - 10-Lead MicroPak™ (1.6 x 2.1 mm)

- **Special Features:**
  - Low On Capacitance: 2.7 pF (MHL), 4.1 pF (USB)
  - MHL Data Rate: 4.92 Gbps (with a 3dB frequency of 2.46 GHz)
  - Over-Voltage Tolerance (OVT) on all USB and MHL ports (up to 5.25 V without external components)
  - Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL): 1 (JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The FSA3000 is primarily used in mobile devices such as:
- Cell Phones
- Digital Cameras
- Notebook Computers

It is suitable for applications requiring efficient switching between USB and MHL data paths, enabling features like connector sharing and power management in portable electronics. The device's low power consumption and high-speed capabilities make it ideal for modern mobile applications where space and efficiency are critical.
