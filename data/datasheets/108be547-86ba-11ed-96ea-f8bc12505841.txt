It contains the DAC, input shift register and\nlatches, reference and a rail-to-rail output amplifier. Built using\na CBCMOS process, these monolithic DACs offer the user lowcost, and ease of use in +5 V only systems.\nCoding for the DAC8512 is natural binary with the MSB loaded\nfirst. The output op amp can swing to either rail and is set to a\nrange of 0 V to +4.095 V—for a one-millivolt-per-bit resolution.It is capable of sinking and sourcing 5 mA. An on-chip reference\nis laser trimmed to provide an accurate full-scale output voltage\nof 4.095 V.Serial interface is high speed, three-wire, DSP compatible with\ndata in (SDI), clock (CLK) and load strobe (LD). There is also\na chip-select pin for connecting multiple DACs.\nA CLR input sets the output to zero scale at power on or upon\nuser demand.\nThe DAC8512 is specified over the extended industrial (–40 °C\nto +85°C) temperature range. DAC8512s are available in plas-\ntic DIPs and SO-8 surface mount packages.\n1.0\n–1.0\n4096–0.5\n–0.75\n00\n–0.250.250.50.75\n3072 2048 1024\nDIGITAL INPUT CODE – DecimalLINEARITY ERROR – LSB\nLinearity Error vs. Digital Input Code\nREV.

It contains a voltage-switched, 12-bit, laser-trimmed\nDAC, a curvature-corrected bandgap reference, a rail-to-rail\noutput op amp, a DAC register, and a serial data input register.The serial data interface consists of a CLK, serial data in (SDI),\nand a load strobe (\nLD). This basic 3-wire interface offers maxi-\nmum flexibility for interface to the widest variety of serial datainput loading requirements. In addition a \nCS select is provided\nfor multiple packaging loading and a power on reset CLR  pin to\nsimplify start or periodic resets.\nD/A CONVERTER SECTION\nThe DAC is a 12-bit voltage mode device with an output thatswings from GND potential to the 2.5 volt internal bandgap\nvoltage. It uses a laser trimmed R-2R ladder which is switched\nby N channel MOSFETs. The output voltage of the DAC has aconstant resistance independent of digital input code. The DAC\noutput is internally connected to the rail-to-rail output op amp.\nAMPLIFIER SECTION\nThe DAC’s output is buffered by a low power consumption pre-\ncision amplifier. This amplifier contains a differential PNP pairinput stage which provides low offset voltage and low noise, as\nwell as the ability to amplify the zero-scale DAC output volt-\nages. The rail-to-rail amplifier is configured in a gain of 1.6384(= 4.095 V/2.5 V) in order to set the 4.095 volt full-scale output\n(1 mV/LSB).

AOUTPUT SECTION\nThe rail-to-rail output stage of this amplifier has been designed\nto provide precision performance while operating near either\npower supply.\nVDD\nVOUT\nAGNDN-CHP-CH\nFigure 4. Equivalent Analog Output Circuit\nFigure 4 shows an equivalent output schematic of the rail-to-rail\namplifier with its N channel pull down FETs that will pull an\noutput load directly to GND. The output sourcing current is\nprovided by a P channel pull up device that can supply GNDterminated loads, especially at the low supply tolerance values of\n4.75 volts. Figures 5 and 6 provide information on output swing\nperformance near ground and full-scale as a function of load. Inaddition to resistive load driving capability the amplifier has also\nbeen carefully designed and characterized for up to 500 pF ca-\npacitive load driving capability.\nPOWER SUPPLY\nThe very low power consumption of the DAC8512 is a directresult of a circuit design optimizing use of the CBCMOS pro-\ncess. By using the low power characteristics of the CMOS for\nthe logic, and the low noise, tight matching of the complemen-tary bipolar transistors good analog accuracy is achieved.\nFor power consumption sensitive applications it is important to\nnote that the internal power consumption of the DAC8512 is\nstrongly dependent on the actual logic input voltage levelspresent on the SDI, \nCS, LD, and CLR  pins. Since these inputs\nare standard CMOS logic structures they contribute static\npower dissipation dependent on the actual driving logic V OH and\nVOL voltage levels. The graph in Figure 9 shows the effect on to-\ntal DAC8512 supply current as a function of the actual value of\ninput logic voltage. Consequently use of CMOS logic vs. TTLminimizes power dissipation in the static state. A V\nIL = 0 V on\nthe SDI, CS and CLR pins provides the lowest standby power\ndissipation of 2.5 mW (500 µA × 5 V).As with any analog system, it is recommended that the DAC8512\npower supply be bypassed on the same PC card that contains thechip. Figure 10 shows the power supply rejection versus frequen-\ncy performance. This should be taken into account when using\nhigher frequency switched mode power supplies with ripple fre-quencies of 100 kHz and higher.\nOne advantage of the rail-to-rail output amplifier used in the\nDAC8512 is the wide range of usable supply voltage. The part\nis fully specified and tested over temperature for operation from+4.75 V to +5.25 V. If reduced linearity and source current ca-\npability near full scale can be tolerated, operation of the DAC8512\nis possible down to +4.3 volts. The minimum operating supplyvoltage versus load current plot, in Figure 11, provides informa-\ntion for operation below V\nDD = +4.75 V.\nTIMING AND CONTROL\nThe DAC8512 has a separate serial input register from the\n12-bit DAC register that allows preloading of a new data valueinto the serial register without disturbing the present DAC out-\nput voltage. After the new value is fully loaded in the serial in-\nput register it can be asynchronously transferred to the DACregister by strobing the \nLD pin. The DAC register uses a level\nsensitive LD strobe that should be returned high before any\nnew data is loaded into the serial input register. At any time thecontents of the DAC register can be reset to zero by strobing\nthe \nCLR  pin which causes the DAC output voltage to go to\nzero volts. All of the timing requirements are detailed in Figure1 along with the Table I Control-Logic Truth Table.\nREV.

AAPPLICATIONS SECTION\nPower Supplies, Bypassing, and Grounding\nAll precision converter products require careful application of\ngood grounding practices to maintain full rated performance.\nBecause the DAC8512 has been designed for +5 V applications,\nit is ideal for those applications under microprocessor or micro-computer control. In these applications, digital noise is preva-\nlent; therefore, special care must be taken to assure that its\ninherent precision is maintained. This means that particularlygood engineering judgment should be exercised when address-\ning the power supply, grounding, and bypassing issues using the\nDAC8512.\nThe power supply used for the DAC8512 should be well filtered\nand regulated. The device has been completely characterized for\na +5 V supply with a tolerance of ±5%. Since a +5 V logic sup-\nply is almost universally available, it is not recommended toconnect the DAC directly to an unfiltered logic supply without\ncareful filtering. Because it is convenient, a designer might be\ninclined to tap a logic circuit’s supply for the DAC’s supply.Unfortunately, this is not wise because fast logic with nanosec-\nond transition edges induce high current pulses. The high tran-\nsient current pulses can generate glitches hundreds of millivoltsin amplitude due to wiring resistances and inductances. This\nhigh frequency noise will corrupt the analog circuits internal to\nthe DAC and cause errors. Even though their spike noise islower in amplitude, directly tapping the output of a +5 V system\nsupply can cause errors because these supplies are of the switch-\ning regulator type that can and do generate a great deal of highfrequency noise. Therefore, the DAC and any associated analog\ncircuitry should be powered directly from the system power sup-\nply outputs using appropriate filtering. Figure 23 illustrates howa clean, analog-grade supply can be generated from a +5 V logic\nsupply using a differential LC filter with separate power supply\nand return lines. With the values shown, this filter can easilyhandle 100 mA of load current without saturating the ferrite\ncores. Higher current capacity can be achieved with larger ferrite\ncores. For lowest noise, all electrolytic capacitors should be lowESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) type.\n100mF\nELECT.10-22mF\nTANT.0.1mF\nCER.TTL/CMOS\nLOGIC\nCIRCUITS\n+5V\nPOWER SUPPLY+5V\n+5V\nRETURNFERRITE BEADS:\n2 TURNS, FAIR-RITE#2677006301\nFigure 23. Properly Filtering a +5 V Logic Supply Can Yield\na High Quality Analog Supply\nIn order to fit the DAC8512 in an 8-pin package, it was neces-\nsary to use only one ground connection to the device. The\nground connection of the DAC serves as the return path for\nsupply currents as well as the reference point for the digital in-put thresholds. The ground connection also serves as the supply\nrail for the internal voltage reference and the output amplifier.\nTherefore, to minimize any errors, it is recommended thatthe ground connection of the DAC8512 be connected to a high\nquality analog ground, such as the one described above. Gener-ous bypassing of the DAC’s supply goes a long way in reducing\nsupply line-induced errors. Local supply bypassing consisting of\na 10 µF tantalum electrolytic in parallel with a 0.1 µF ceramic is\nrecommended.

AOperating the DAC8512 on +12 V or +15 V Supplies Only\nAlthough the DAC8512 has been specified to operate on a\nsingle, +5 V supply, a single +5 V supply may not be available in\nmany applications. Since the DAC8512 consumes no more than\n2.5 mA, maximum, then an integrated voltage reference, such asthe REF02, can be used as the DAC8512 +5 V supply. The\nconfiguration of the circuit is shown in Figure 26. Notice that\nthe reference’s output voltage requires no trimming because ofthe REF02’s excellent load regulation and tight initial output\nvoltage tolerance. Although the maximum supply current of the\nDAC8512 is 2.5 mA, local bypassing of the REF02’s outputwith at least 0.1 µF at the DAC’s voltage supply pin is recom-\nmended to prevent the DAC’s internal digital circuits from af-\nfecting the DAC’s internal voltage reference.\n+12V OR +15V\n0.1mF\n4REF02 620.1mF\n62\n8DAC8512\nVOUT1\n5\n3\n4\n7GNDCS\nCLR\nLD\nSCLK\nSDIVDD\nFigure 26. Operating the DAC8512 on +12 V or +15 V\nSupplies Using a REF02 Voltage Reference\nMeasuring Offset Error\nOne of the most commonly specified endpoint errors associated\nwith real world nonideal DACs is offset error.\nIn most DAC testing, the offset error is measured by applying\nthe zero-scale code and measuring the output deviation from 0\nvolt. There are some DACs where offset errors may be presentbut not observable at the zero scale because of other circuit limi-\ntations (for example, zero coinciding with single-supply ground).\nIn these DACs, nonzero output at zero code cannot be read asthe offset error. In the DAC8512, for example, the zero-scale\nerror is specified to be ±3 LSBs. Since zero scale coincides with\nzero volt, it is not possible to measure negative offset error.\nVOUT 0.1mF\n200mA, MAX\nV–62\n8DAC85121+5V\nCS\nCLR\n5\n3\n4LD\nSCLK\nSDIR\n7\nSET CODE = 000H AND MEASURE VOUTGNDVDD\nFigure 27. Measuring Zero-Scale or Offset ErrorBy adding a pull-down resistor from the output of the DAC8412\nto a negative supply as shown in Figure 27, offset errors cannow be read at zero code. This configuration forces the output\np-channel MOSFET to source current to the negative supply\nthereby allowing the designer to determine in which direction theoffset error appears. The value of the resistor should be such that,\nat zero code, current through the resistor is 200 µA, maximum.\nBipolar Output Operation\nAlthough the DAC8512 has been designed for single-supply op-\neration, bipolar operation is achievable using the circuit illus-\ntrated in Figure 28. The circuit uses a single-supply, rail-to-rail\nOP295 op amp and the REF03 to generate the –2.5 V referencerequired to level-shift the DAC output voltage. Note that the –\n2.5 V reference was generated without the use of precision resis-\ntors. The circuit has been configured to provide an outputvoltage in the range –5 V ≤ V\nOUT ≤ +5 V and is coded in com-\nplementary offset binary. Although each DAC LSB corresponds\nto 1 mV, each output LSB has been scaled to 2.44 mV.

This is very com-\nmon in data acquisition systems using microprocessor-based\nsystems. In these systems, +12 V, +15 V, and/or +5 V are onlyavailable. Shown in Figure 30 is a method of generating a nega-\ntive supply voltage using one CD4049, a CMOS hex inverter,\noperating on +12 V or +15 V. The circuit is essentially a chargepump where two of the six are used as an oscillator. For the val-\nues shown, the frequency of oscillation is approximately 3.5 kHz\nand is fairly insensitive to supply voltage because R1 > 2 × R2.\nThe remaining four inverters are wired in parallel for higher out-\nput current. The square wave output is level translated by C2 to\na negative-going signal, rectified using a pair of 1N4001s, andthen filtered by C3. With the values shown, the charge pump\nwill provide an output voltage of –5 V for current loadings in the\nrange 0.5 mA ≤ I\nOUT ≤ 10 mA with a +15 V supply and 0.5 mA\n≤ IOUT ≤ 7 mA with a +12 V supply.\n91 06\n11 12\n14 157\n32 5 4\nR2\n5.1kWR1\n510kW\nC1\n0.02mFC2\n47mF\nD1\n1N4001C347mF1N5231\n5.1VZENERD2\n1N4001R3\n470W\n–5VINVERTERS = CD4049\nFigure 30.

Therefore, each DAC LSB corresponds to\n2.4 µA. If a bipolar output current is required, then the circuit\nin Figure 28 can be modified to drive the AMP05’s reference\npin with a ±1 V input signal.\nPotentiometer P1 trims the output current to zero with the in-\nput at 0 V.

AOpto-Isolated Interfaces for Process Control Environments\nIn many process control type applications, it is necessary to pro-\nvide an isolation barrier between the controller and the unit be-\ning controlled. Opto-isolators can provide isolation in excess of\n3 kV. The serial loading structure of the DAC8512 makes itideal for opto-isolated interfaces as the number of interface lines\nis kept to a minimum.\nIllustrated in Figure 34 is an opto-isolated interface using the\nDAC8512. In this circuit, the \nCS line is always LOW to enable\nthe DAC, and the 10 k Ω/1 µF combination connected to the\nDAC’s CLR  pin sets a turn-on time constant of 10 ms to reset\nthe DAC upon application of power. Three opto-couplers arethen used for the SDI, SCLK, and \nLD lines.\nOften times reducing the number of interface lines to two lines\nis required in many control environments. The circuit illustrated\nin Figure 35 shows how to convert a two-line interface into thethree control lines required to control the DAC8512 without us-\ning one shots. This technique uses a counter to keep track of the\nclock cycles and, when all the data has been input to the DAC,the external logic generates the \nLD pulse.0.1mF+5V\n56\n8DAC85121\nCS3\n4\n720.1mF10kW+5V\nVOUT+5V+5V\n+5V10kW\nSCLK\n10kW\nSDI10kW\nLD\nLD\nSCLK\nSDI+5V\nREG+5V\nPOWERHIGH VOLTAGE\nISOLATION\nFigure 34.

Opto-lsolated Two-Wire Serial Interface Timing Diagram\nThe timing diagram of Figure 36 can be used to understand the\noperation of the circuit. Only two opto-couplers are used in the\ncircuit; one for SCLK and one for SDI. The 74HC161 counterin incremented on every rising edge of the clock. Additionally,\nthe data is loaded into the DAC8512 on the falling edge of the\nclock by inverting the serial clock using gate “Y.” The timingdiagram shows that after the twelfth bit has been clocked the\noutput of the counter is binary 1011. On the very next rising\nclock edge, the output of the counter changes to binary 1100upon which the output of gate “X” goes LOW to generate the\nLD pulse. The LD signal is connected to both the DAC’s LD\nand the counter’s LOAD pins to prevent the thirteenth risingclock edge from advancing the DAC’s internal shift register.\nThis prevents false loading of data into the DAC8512. Inverting\nthe DAC’s serial clock allows sufficient time from the CLK edgeto the \nLD edge, and from the LD edge to the next clock pulse\nall of which satisfies the timing requirements for loading the\nDAC8512.\nAfter loading one address of the DAC, the entire process can re-\npeated to load another address. If the loading is complete, then\nthe clock must stop after the thirteenth pulse of the final load.\nThe DAC’s clock input will be pulled high and the counter resetto zero. As was shown in Figure 35, both the 74HC161’s and\nthe DAC8512’s \nCLR  pins are connected to a simple R-C timing\ncircuit that resets both ICs when the power in turned on. Thecircuit’s time constant should be set longer than the power sup-\nply turn-on time and, in this circuit, is set to 10 ms, which\nshould be adequate for most systems. This same two-wire inter-face can be used for other three-wire serial input DACs.\nDecoding Multiple DAC8512s\nThe CS function of the DAC8512 can be used in applications\nto decode a number of DACs. In this application, all DACs re-ceive the same input data; however, only one of the DAC’s \nCS\ninput is asserted to transfer its serial input register contents into\nthe destination DAC register. In this circuit, shown in Figure 37,the \nCS timing is generated by a 74HC139 decoder and should\nfollow the DAC8512’s standard timing requirements.

AA Digitally Controlled, Ultralow Noise VCA\nThe circuit in Figure 38 illustrates how the DAC8512 can be\nused to control an ultralow noise VCA, using the AD600/AD602. The AD600/AD602 is a dual, low noise, wideband,\nvariable gain amplifier based on the X-AMP topology.* Both\nchannels of the AD600 are wired in parallel to achieve awideband VCA which exhibits an RTI (Referred To Input)\nnoise voltage spectral density of approximately 1 nV/ √\nHz. The\noutput of the VCA requires an AD844 configured in a gain of 4to account for signal loss due to input and output 50 Ω termina-\ntions. As configured, the total gain in the circuit is 40 dB.\nSince the output of the DAC8512 is single quadrant, it was nec-\nessary to offset the AD600’s gain control voltage so that the gainof the circuit is 0 dB for zero scale and 40 dB at full scale. This\nwas achieved by setting C1LO and C2LO to +625 mV using R1\nand R2. Next, the output of the DAC8512 was scaled so thatthe gain of the AD600 equaled 20 dB when the digital input\ncode equaled 800\nH. The frequency response of the VCA as a\nfunction of digital code is shown in Figure 39.\n*For more details regarding the AD600 or AD602, please consult the AD600/\nAD602 data sheet.+70\n+20\n–30\n100k 100M 10M 1M 10k+30+40+50+60\n–20–100+10\nFREQUENCY – HzSYSTEM GAIN – dB4095\n3072\n2048\n1024\n0\nFigure 39.

AA Serial DAC, Audio Volume Control\nThe DAC8512 is well suited to control digitally the gain or at-\ntenuation of a voltage controlled amplifier. In professional audiomixing consoles, music synthesizers, and other audio processors,\nVCAs, such as the SSM2018, adjust audio channel gain and at-\ntenuation from front panel potentiometers. The VCA provides aclean gain transition control of the audio level when the slew\nrate of the analog input control voltage, V\nC, is properly chosen.\nThe circuit in Figure 40 illustrates a volume control applicationusing the DAC8512 to control the attenuation of the SSM2018.\n62\nDAC8512 8+15V\n7CS\nCLR10.1mF\n4REF02 6218kW10pF470kWP1 \n100kW10MW\nOFFSET\nTRIM\n47pFSYMMETRY\nTRIMP2\n500kW\nVOUT+15V\n–15V\n30kW\n+15V\n–15V\n0.1mF0.1mF+15V\n18kW\nVIN1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n1413\n12\n11\n10\n9SSM2018\n+5V0.1mF\nCCON\n1mFR6\n825W\nR7\n1kW*0V £ VC £ +2.24V\n* – PRECISION RESISTOR \nPT146  1kW COMPENSATOR5LD\n3 SCLK\n4 SDI\nFigure 40. A Serial DAC, Audio Volume Control\nSince the supply voltage available in these systems is typically\n±15 V or ±18 V, a REF02 is used to supply the +5 V required\nto power the DAC. No trimming of the reference is required be-cause of the reference’s tight initial tolerance and low supply\ncurrent consumption of the DAC8512. The SSM2018 is config-\nured as a unity-gain buffer when its control voltage equals 0volt. This corresponds to a 000\nH code from the DAC8512.\nSince the SSM2018 exhibits a gain constant of –28 mV/dB\n(typical), the DAC’s full-scale output voltage has to be scaleddown by R6 and R7 to provide 80 dB of attenuation when theTable IV.

A\nCCON of 1 µF provides a control transition time of 1 ms which\nyields a click-free change in the audio channel attenuation.

These current transmitters use a “zero-scale” sig-\nnal current of 4 mA that can be used to power the transmitter’ssignal conditioning circuitry. The “full-scale” output signal in\nthese transmitters is 20 mA. The converse approach to process\ncontrol can also be used; a low-power, programmable currentsource can be used to control remotely located sensors or de-\nvices in the loop.\nA circuit that performs this function is illustrated in Figure 41.\nUsing the DAC8512 as the controller, the circuit provides aprogrammable output current of 4 mA to 20 mA, proportional\nto the DAC’s digital code. Biasing for the controller is provided\nby the REF02 and requires no external trim for two reasons:\n(1) the REF02’s tight initial output voltage tolerance and (2) the\nlow supply current consumption of both the OP90 and the\nDAC8512. The entire circuit, including opto-couplers, con-\nsumes less than 3 mA from the total budget of 4 mA.

An Isolated, Programmable, 4-20 mA Process Controller\nFor the values shown in Figure 41,\nIOUT = 3.9 µA × Digital Code + 4 mA\ngiving a full-scale output current of 20 mA when the\nDAC8512’s digital code equals FFF H. Offset trim at 4 mA is\nprovided by P2, and P1 provides the circuit’s gain trim at 20 mA.\nThese two trims do not interact because the noninverting inputof the OP90 is at virtual ground. The Schottky diode, D1, is re-\nquired in this circuit to prevent loop supply power-on transients\nfrom pulling the noninverting input of the OP90 more than300 mV below its inverting input. Without this diode, such tran-\nsients could cause phase reversal of the OP90 and possible\nlatchup of the controller. The loop supply voltage compliance ofthe circuit is limited by the maximum applied input voltage to\nthe REF02 and is from +12 V to +40 V.\nMICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING\nDAC8512–MC68HC11 Interface\nThe circuit illustrated in Figure 42 shows a serial interface be-\ntween the DAC8512 and the MC68HC11 8-bit microcontrol-ler. SCK of the 68HC11 drives SCLK of the DAC8512, while\nthe MOSI output drives the serial data line, SDI, of the\nDAC8512. The DAC’s \nCLR , LD, and CS signals are derived\nfrom port lines PC1, PD5, and PC0, respectively, as shown.\nFor correct operation of the serial interface, the 68HC11 should\nbe configured such that its CPOL bit is set to 1 and its CPHA\nbit is also set to 1. When the serial data is to be transmitted tothe DAC, PC0 is taken low, asserting the DAC’s \nCS input.\nWhen the 68HC11 is configured in this manner, serial data onPC1\nPC0\nSCK\nMOSISS\nCLK\nSDILDMC68HC11* DAC8512*\nCSCLR\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY\nFigure 42. DAC8512–MC68HC11 Interface\nMOSI is valid on the rising edge of SCLK. The 68HC11 trans-\nmits its serial data in 8-bit bytes (MSB first), with only eight ris-\ning clock edges occurring in the transmit cycle. To load data tothe DAC8512’s input serial register, PC0 is left low after the\nfirst eight bits are transferred, and a second byte of data is then\ntransferred serially to the DAC8512. During the second byteload, the first four most significant bits of the first byte are\npushed out of the DAC’s input shift register. At the end of the\nsecond byte load, PC0 is then taken high. To prevent an acci-dental advancing of the internal shift register, SCLK must al-\nready be asserted before PC0 is taken high. To transfer the\ncontents of the input shift register to the DAC register, PD5 istaken low, asserting the DAC’s \nLD input. The DAC’s CLR  in-\nput, controlled by the 68HC11’s PC1 port, provides an asyn-\nchronous clear function, setting the DAC output to zero.Included in this section is the source code for operating the\nDAC8512—M68HC11 interface.\nDAC8512\n–18– REV.
