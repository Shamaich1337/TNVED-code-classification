The regulators are guaranteed to supply 1A ofoutput current.\nAs Figure 1 shows, the device consists of a +1.25V ref-\nerence, error amplifier, MOSFET driver, p-channel passtransistor, internal feedback voltage-divider, Dual Modecomparator, and 4ms reset output.\nThe +1.25V reference is connected to the inverting\ninput of the error amplifier. The error amplifier com-pares this reference with the selected feedback voltageand amplifies the difference. The MOSFET driver readsthe error signal and applies the appropriate drive to thep-channel transistor. If the feedback voltage is lowerthan the reference, the pass transistor’s gate is pulledlower, allowing more current to pass and increase theoutput voltage. If the feedback voltage is high, the passtransistor’s gate is pulled up, allowing less current topass to the output. The low V\nOUT comparator senses\nwhen the feedback voltage has dropped 6% below itsexpected level, causing RST to go low.\nThe output voltage is fed back through either an inter-nal resistor-divider connected to OUT or an externalresistor network connected to SET. The Dual Modecomparator examines V\nSETand selects the feedback\npath. If V SETis below 50mV, the internal feedback path\nis used and the output is regulated to the factory-presetvoltage.\nMAX1793Low-Dropout, Low I Q, 1A Linear Regulator\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 7Dual Mode is a trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.\n1175mVIN\nOUT\n100mVNMOS\n4ms4ms DELAY TIMER\nR1\nR2PMOS\nOUT\nSET\nGNDSHDNIN\nRSTSHUTDOWN\nLOGIC\n1.25V\nREFERENCEMOSFET DRIVER\nWITH FOLDBACK\nCURRENT LIMITERROR AMPSHUTDOWN\nTHERMAL\nSENSOR\n94% V OUT\nDETECTOR\nDUAL MODE\nCOMPARATORMAX1793\nFigure 1. Functional Diagram\nMAX1793Internal p-Channel Pass Transistor\nThe MAX1793 features a 1A p-channel MOSFET pass\ntransistor. Unlike similar designs using pnp pass tran-sistors, p-channel MOSFETs require no base drive,which reduces quiescent current. pnp-based regula-tors also waste considerable current in dropout whenthe pass transistor saturates and use high base-drivecurrents under large loads. The MAX1793 does not suf-fer from these problems and consumes only 225µA ofquiescent current under heavy loads, as well as indropout.\nOutput Voltage Selection\nThe MAX1793 features Dual Mode operation. In presetvoltage mode, the output of the MAX1793 is set to aninternally trimmed voltage (see the \nOrdering\nInformation ). Select this mode by connecting SET to\nGND (Figure 2).\nIn adjustable mode, an output is selected between\n+1.25V and +5V using two external resistors connectedas a voltage-divider to SET (Figure 3). The output volt-age is determined by the following equation:\nV\nOUT= VSET[1 + (R1/R2)]\nwhere V SET= +1.25V. To simplify resistor selection:\nR1 = R2 [(V OUT/VSET) – 1]\nSince the input bias current at SET is less than 100nA,large resistance values can be used for R1 and R2 tominimize power consumption without losing efficiency.Up to 125kΩ is acceptable for R2.\nIn preset voltage mode, the impedance from SET toGND should be less than 10kΩ . Otherwise, spurious\nconditions could cause the voltage at SET to exceedthe 50mV dual-mode threshold.Shutdown\nA logic-low on SHDN disables the MAX1793. In shut-\ndown, the pass transistor, control circuitry, reference,and all internal circuits are turned off, reducing supplycurrent to typically 0.1µA. Connect SHDN to IN for nor-\nmal operation. In shutdown, RST goes low and OUT is\ndischarged to GND with a 5kΩ internal resistance.\nRST Comparator\nThe MAX1793 features a low V OUTindicator that asserts\nwhen the output voltage falls out of regulation.  Theopen-drain RST output goes low when OUT falls 6%\nbelow its nominal output voltage. RST remains low for\n4ms after OUT has returned to its nominal value. A100kΩ pullup resistor from RST to a suitable logic sup-\nply voltage (typically OUT) provides a logic control sig-nal. RST can be used as a power-on-reset (POR) signal\nto a microcontroller or can drive an external LED to indi-cate power failure. RST is low during shutdown.\nCurrent Limiting\nThe MAX1793 features a current limit that monitors thepass transistor, typically limiting short-circuit outputcurrent to 1.8A. The current limit is increased toapproximately 2.8A when the output voltage is in regu-lation, improving performance with large transientloads. The output can be shorted to ground for anindefinite period of time without damaging the device.\nThermal-Overload Protection\nThermal-overload protection limits total power dissipa-tion in the MAX1793. When the junction temp erature\nexceeds T\nJ= +170°C, a thermal sensor turns off the\npass transistor, allowing the IC to cool. The thermal sen-\nsor turns the pass transistor on once the IC’s junction\ntemperature drops approximately 20°C. Continuousshort-circuit conditions will result in a pulsed output.Low-Dropout, Low I Q, 1A Linear Regulator\n8 _______________________________________________________________________________________NC\nMAX1793 IN\nIN\nININ\nIN\nOFFONCIN = 4.7µF\nSHDNOUT\nOUT\nOUT\nOUT\nRST\nSET\nGNDCOUT  = 6.8µFOUT\nRESET\nOUTPUT\nFigure 2.

For con-tinuous operation, do not exceed the absolute maxi-mum junction-temperature rating of T\nJ= +150°C.\nOperating Region and Power Dissipation\nMaximum power dissipation of the MAX1793 dependson the thermal resistance of the case and circuit board,the temperature difference between the die junctionand ambient air, and the rate of air flow. The power dis-sipated by the device is: P = I\nOUT (VIN– VOUT). The\nresulting maximum power dissipation is:\nPMAX = [(T J(MAX) – TA)/(θJC+ θCA)]\nwhere (T J(MAX) – TA) is the temperature difference\nbetween the maximum allowed die junction (+150°C) andthe surrounding air, θ\nJC (junction-to-case) is the thermal\nresistance of the package chosen, and θ CAis the thermal\nresistance from the case through the PCB, copper traces,and other materials to the surrounding air. Figure 4 showsallowable power dissipation for typical PCBs at +25°C,+50°C, and +70°C ambient temperatures. \nThe MAX1793 TSSOP-EP package features an exposed\nthermal pad on its underside. This pad lowers the ther-mal resistance of the package by providing a direct heatconduction path from the die to the PCB. Additionally,the ground pin (GND) also channels heat. Connect theexposed thermal pad and GND to circuit ground byusing a large pad (minimum 1in\n2recommended), or mul-\ntiple vias to the ground plane.\nApplications Information\nCapacitor Selection \nand Regulator Stability\nCapacitors are required at the input and output of theMAX1793. Connect a 4.7µF capacitor between IN andground (C\nIN) and a 6.8µF capacitor between OUT and\nground (C OUT). CINserves only to lower the source\nimpedance of the input supply and may be smaller than4.7µF when the MAX1793 is powered from regulatedpower supplies or low-impedance batteries.\nThe output capacitor’s equivalent series resistance (ESR)\naffects stability and output noise. C\nOUT ESR should be\n0.5Ω or less to ensure stability and optimum transient\nresponse. Surface-mount ceramic capacitors have verylow ESR and are commonly available in values up to10µF. Other low-ESR (< 0.5 Ω) capacitors, such as sur-\nface-mount tantalum or OS-CON, may also be used.Connect C INand C\nOUTas close to the IC as possible to\nminimize the impact of PCB trace inductance.Noise, PSRR, and Transient Response\nThe MAX1793 output noise is typically 115µV RMS during\nnormal operation. This is suitably low for most applica-tions. See the output noise plot in the \nTypical Operating\nCharacteristics .\nThe MAX1793 is designed to achieve low dropout volt-age and low quiescent current in battery-powered sys-tems while still maintaining good noise, transientresponse, and AC rejection. See the \nTypical Operating\nCharacteristics for a plot of Power-Supply Rejection\nRatio (PSRR) vs. Frequency. When operating from verynoisy sources, supply noise rejection and transientresponse can be improved by increasing the values ofthe input and output capacitors and employing passivepostfiltering.\nInput-Output (Dropout) Voltage\nA regulator’s minimum input-to-output voltage differential(dropout voltage) determines the lowest usable supplyvoltage. In battery-powered systems, this determines theuseful end-of-life battery voltage. Since a p-channelMOSFET is used as the pass device, dropout voltage isthe product of R\nDS(ON) and load current (see the\nElectrical Characteristics and Dropout Voltage vs. Load\nCurrent in the Typical Operating Characteristics ).
