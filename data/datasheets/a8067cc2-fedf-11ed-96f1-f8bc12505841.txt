#### Description:
The FRX250-90F is a radial leaded PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) resettable fuse designed to provide overcurrent protection in electronic circuits. It operates by increasing its resistance significantly when the current exceeds a certain threshold (trip current), effectively interrupting the circuit. Once the fault condition is removed and the device cools down, it resets automatically, allowing normal operation to resume.

#### Typical Applications:
The FRX250-90F is commonly used in:
- **Telecommunications Equipment:** Protecting circuits from overcurrent conditions.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Safeguarding devices such as chargers, power supplies, and other electronic equipment.
- **Industrial Equipment:** Providing overcurrent protection in various industrial applications.
- **Automotive Applications:** Used in automotive electronics for circuit protection.

This component is particularly suitable for applications where space is limited and where a reliable, resettable protection mechanism is required.
