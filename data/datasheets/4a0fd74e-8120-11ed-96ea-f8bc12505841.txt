The performance of chip multilayer ceramic capacitors (henceforth just "capacitors”) may be affected by the storage conditions. Please use them promptly after delivery.\n  1-1. Maintain appropriate storage for the capacitors using the following conditions:\n        \u3000Room Temperature of 5 ℃ to 40℃ and a Relative Humidity of 20% to 70%.\n          High temperature and humidity conditions and/or prolonged storage may cause deterioration of the packaging materials.\n          If more than six months have elapsed since delivery, check packaging, mounting, etc. before use.\n          In addition, this may cause oxidation of the electrodes. If more than one year has elapsed since delivery, also check the solderability before use.\n\u30001-2. Corrosive gas can react with the termination (external) electrodes or lead wires of capacitors, and result in poor solderability.\n           Do not store the capacitors in an atmosphere consisting of corrosive gas (e.g.,hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, chlorine, ammonia gas etc.).  \n  1-3. Due to moisture condensation caused by rapid humidity changes, or the photochemical change caused by direct sunlight on the terminal electrodes \n          and/or the resin/epoxy coatings,  the solderability and electrical performance may deteriorate. \n          Do not store capacitors under direct sunlight or in high huimidity conditions.! \nGRM31CR61H106KA12-01A\n■Rating\n1.Temperature Dependent Characteristics\n1.

PCB Design" or "3. Optimum solder amount" for the solder amount and the fillet shapes.\n1. Correction with a Soldering Iron\n\u30001-1. In order to reduce damage to the capacitor, be sure to preheat the capacitor and the mounting board.\n           Preheat to the temperature range shown in Table 3. A hot plate, hot air type preheater, etc. can be used for preheating.\n   1-2. After soldering, do not allow the component/PCB to cool down rapidly.\n   1-3. Perform the corrections with a soldering iron as quickly as possible. If the soldering iron is applied too long,  there is a possibility of \n           causing solder leaching on the terminal electrodes, which will cause deterioration of the adhesive strength and other problems.\n           \nTable 3\nLead Free Solder: Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu\n* Please manage Δ T in the temperature of soldering iron and the preheating temperature. \n2. Correction with Spot Heater\n     \u3000Compared to local heating with a soldering iron, hot air heating by a spot heater heats the overall component and board,\n        therefore, it tends to lessen the thermal shock. In the case of a high density mounted board, a spot heater can also prevent concerns \n        of the soldering iron making direct contact with the component.\n  2-1. If the distance from the hot air outlet of the spot heater to the component is too close, cracks may occur due to thermal shock. \n          To prevent this problem, follow the conditions shown in Table 4.\n  2-2. In order to create an appropriate solder fillet shape, it is recommended that hot air be applied at the angle shown  in Figure 1.\n        \nTable 4\nDistance 5mm or more\nHot Air Application angle 45° *Figure 1\nHot Air Temperature Nozzle Outlet 400°C max.\nLess than 10 s\n(3216M / 1206 size or smaller)\nLess than 30 s\n(3225M / 1210 size or larger)\n(3216M , 3225M : Metric size code)\n3.

Selection of Adhesive\n 1-1. Depending on the type of adhesive, there may be a decrease in insulation resistance. In addition, there is a chance that the capacitor might crack from contractile stress due to the difference \n         in the contraction rate of the capacitor and the adhesive.\n         \n 1-2. If there is not enough adhesive, the contact surface area is too small, or the curing temperature or curing time are inadequate, the adhesive strength will be insufficient and the capacitor may loosen\n         or become disconnected during transportation or soldering.\n         If there is too much adhesive, for example if it overflows onto the land, the result could be soldering defects, loss of electrical connection, insufficient curing, or slippage after the capacitor is mounted.      \n         Furthermore, if the curing temperature is too high or the curing time is too long, not only will the adhesive strength be reduced, but solderability may also suffer due to the effects of oxidation on\n         the terminations (outer electrodes) of the capacitor and the land surface on the board.\n (1) Selection of Adhesive\n      \u3000Epoxy resins are a typical class of adhesive. To select the proper adhesive, consider the following points.\n      \u30001) There must be enough adhesive strength to prevent the component from loosening or slipping during the mounting process.\n      \u30002) The adhesive strength must not decrease when exposed to moisture during soldering.\n  \u3000    3) The adhesive must have good coatability and shape retention properties.\n     \u3000 4) The adhesive must have a long pot life.\n       \u30005) The curing time must be short.\n    \u3000  6) The adhesive must not be corrosive to the exterior of the capacitor or the board.\n    \u3000  7) The adhesive must have good insulation properties.\n\u3000      8) The adhesive must not emit toxic gases or otherwise be harmful to health.\n   \u3000   9) The adhesive must be free of halogenated compounds.\n (2) Use the following illustration as a guide to the amount of adhesive to apply.\n\u3000  \u3000Chip Dimension (L/W) \u3000Code:18/21/31\n2.Flux\n 2-1. An excessive amount of flux generates a large quantity of flux gas, which can cause a deterioration of solderability,\n     \u3000 so apply flux thinly and evenly throughout. (A foaming system is generally used for flow solderring.)\n 2-2. Flux containing too high a percentage of halide may cause corrosion of the terminations unless there is sufficient cleaning. Use flux with a halide content of 0.1% max.\n 2-3. Strong acidic flux can corrode the capacitor and degrade its performance.\n         Please check the quality of capacitor after mounting.\n3.Leaching of the terminations\n   Set temperature and time to ensure that leaching of the \n   terminations does not exceed  25% of the chip end \n   area as a single chip (full length of the edge A-B-C-D \n   shown at right) and 25% of the length A-B shown as \n   mounted on substrate.\nLand\nResistAdhesive\nCross Sectional ViewResist\nSide View\nA \nB \nD \nC Termination  ［As a Single Chip ］ \n［As Mounted on Substrate ］ \nA B \nGRM31CR61H106KA12-01A\n3.Reflow  soldering\n   The flux in the solder paste contains halogen-based substances and organic acids as activators.\n  Strong acidic flux can corrode the capacitor and degrade its performance. Please check the quality of capacitor after mounting.\n4.Washing\n1. Please evaluate the capacitor using actual cleaning equipment and conditions to confirm the quality, and select the solvent for cleaning. \n    \n2. Unsuitable cleaning may leave residual flux or other foreign substances, causing deterioration of electrical characteristics and the reliability of the capacitors.\n         \n5.Coating\n1. A crack may be caused in the capacitor due to the stress of the thermal contraction of the resin during curing process.\n    The stress is affected by the amount of resin and curing contraction. Select a resin with low curing contraction.\n    The difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between a coating resin or a molding resin and the capacitor may cause the destruction and deterioration \n    of the capacitor such as a crack or peeling, and lead to the deterioration of insulation resistance or dielectric breakdown.\n    Select a resin for which the thermal expansion coefficient is as close to that of the capacitor as possible.\n    A silicone resin can be used as an under-coating to buffer against the stress.\n2. Select a resin that is less hygroscopic.\n    Using hygroscopic resins under high humidity conditions may cause the deterioration of the insulation resistance  of a capacitor. \n    An epoxy resin can be used as a less hygroscopic resin.\n3. The halogen system substance and organic acid are included in coating material, and a chip corrodes by the kind of Coating material. Do not use strong acid type.  \n\u3000\u3000\nGRM31CR61H106KA12-01A\n■ Others\n1.Transportation\n1. The performance of a capacitor may be affected by the conditions during transportation.\n 1-1. The capacitors shall be protected against excessive temperature, humidity and mechanical force during transportation.\n          (1) Climatic condition \n             \u3000･ low air temperature : -40 ℃\n                 ･ change of temperature air/air : -25 ℃/+25℃\n                 ･ low air pressure : 30 kPa\n                 ･ change of air pressure : 6 kPa/min.\n         (2) Mechanical condition \n                Transportation shall be done in such a way that the boxes are not deformed and forces are not directly passed  on to the inner packaging.\n 1-2. Do not apply excessive vibration, shock, or pressure to the capacitor.\n         (1) When excessive mechanical shock or pressure is applied to a capacitor, chipping or cracking may occur in the ceramic body of the capacitor.\n               \n         (2) When the sharp edge of an air driver, a soldering iron, tweezers, a chassis, etc. impacts strongly on the surface of the capacitor, the capacitor may crack and short-circuit.\n               \n 1-3. Do not use a capacitor to which excessive shock was applied by dropping etc.\n         A capacitor dropped accidentally during processing may be damaged.\n2.Characteristics Evaluation in the Actual System\n1. Evaluate the capacitor in the actual system, to confirm that there is no problem with the performance and specification values in a finished product before using.\n2. Since a voltage dependency and temperature dependency exists in the capacitance of high dielectric type ceramic capacitors, the capacitance may change depending\n     on the operating conditions in the actual system.\n     Therefore,be sure to evaluate the various characteristics, such as the leakage current and noise absorptivity, which will affect the capacitance value of the capacitor.\n     \n3. In addition,voltages exceeding the predetermined surge may be applied to the capacitor by the inductance in the actual system. \n    Evaluate the surge resistance in the actual system as required.\nGRM31CR61H106KA12-01A\n1.Please make sure that your product has been evaluated in view of your specifications with our product being mounted to your product.\n   \n2.Your are requested not to use our product deviating from this product specification.\n3.We consider it not appropriate to include any terms and conditions with regard to the business transaction in the product specifications, drawings or other technical documents.\n    Therefore, if your technical documents as above include such terms and conditions such as warranty clause, product liability clause, \n    or intellectual property infringement liability clause, they will be deemed to be invalid.\n   \u3000\u3000NOTE! \nGRM31CR61H106KA12-01A\nMouser Electronics\n  \nAuthorized Distributor\n \n  \nClick to View Pricing, Inventory, Delivery & Lifecycle Information:\n \n \n \n Murata:   \n\xa0 GRM31CR61H106KA12L\xa0 GRM31CR61H106KA12K\n'}]
