It provides general-purpose remote I/O expansion and bidirectional voltage translation for processors \nthrough I2C communication, an interface consisting of serial clock (SCL), and serial data (SDA) signals.\nThe major benefit of the TCA6416A is its voltage translation capability over a of a wide supply voltage range. \nThis allows the TCA6416A to interface with modern processors on the I2C side, where supply levels are lower \nto conserve power. In contrast to the dropping power supplies of processors, some PCB components such as \nLEDs, still require a 5-V power supply.\nThe VCCI pin is the power supply for the I2C bus, and therefore the pull-up resistors connected to the SCL, SDA, \nINT, and RESET pins should be terminated at V CCI on the opposite side. level of the I2C bus to the TCA6416A. \nThe VCCP pin is the power supply for the P-ports and if pull-up resistors are used on any P-port or LEDs are \ndriven by any P-port, then the resistor(s) or LED(s) connected to P00-P07 and P10-P17 should be terminated \nat V CCP on the opposite side. The device P-ports configured as outputs have the ability to sink up to 25 mA for \ndirectly driving LEDs, but the current must be limited externally with an additional resistance.\nThe features of the device include an interrupt that is generated on the INT pin whenever an input port changes \nstate. The devices can also be reset to its default state by applying a low logic level to the RESET  pin or by \ncycling power to the device and causing a power-on reset. The ADDR hardware selectable address pin allows \ntwo TCA6416A devices to be connected to the same I2C bus.\nThe TCA6416A open-drain interrupt ( INT) output is activated when any input state differs from its corresponding \nInput Port register state and is used to indicate to the system controller that an input state has changed. The \nINT pin can be connected to the interrupt input of a processor. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, \nthe TCA6416A can inform the processor if there is incoming data on the remote I/O ports without having to \ncommunicate via the I2C bus. Thus, the TCA6416A can remain a simple target device.\nThe system controller can reset the TCA6416A in the event of a timeout or other improper operation by asserting \na low on the RESET  input pin or by cycling the power to the VCCP pin and causing a power-on reset (POR). A \nreset puts the registers in their default state and initializes the I2C /SMBus state machine. The RESET  feature \nand a POR cause the same reset/initialization to occur, but the RESET  feature does so without powering down \nthe part.\nOne hardware pin (ADDR) can be used to program and vary the fixed I2C address and allow two devices to \nshare the same I2C bus or SMBus.\nThe TCA6416A\'s digital core consists of eight 8-bit data registers: two Configuration registers (input or output \nselection), two Input Port registers, two Output Port registers, and two Polarity Inversion registers. At power on \nor after a reset, the I/Os are configured as inputs. However, the system controller can configure the I/Os as \neither inputs or outputs by writing to the Configuration registers. The data for each input or output is kept in the \ncorresponding Input Port or Output Port register. The polarity of the Input Port register can be inverted with the \nPolarity Inversion register. All registers can be read by the system controller.\nwww.ti.comTCA6416A\nSCPS194F – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: TCA6416A\n8.2 Functional Block Diagrams\n22\nI/O PortShift\nRegister16 BitsInput\nFilter 23\nPower-On\nResetRead PulseWrite Pulse21\n24\n12GNDVCCPSDASCLADDR\nI C Bus\nControl2\nRESET3INTInterrupt\nLogicLP Filter1\nVCCI2P10–P17P00–P074-11\n13-20\nA.

The \ninput voltage may be raised above V CC to a maximum of 5.5 V.\nIf the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the output port register. \nIn this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and either V CC or GND. The external voltage \napplied to this I/O pin should not exceed the recommended levels for proper operation.\n8.3.3 Interrupt Output ( INT)\nAn interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the input mode. After time t iv, the \nsignal INT is valid. Resetting the interrupt circuit is achieved when data on the port is changed to the original \nsetting or when data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. Resetting occurs in the read mode at the \nacknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal. Interrupts that occur \nduring the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very short) due to the resetting of the interrupt during this \npulse. Each change of the I/Os after resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.\nReading from or writing to another device does not affect the interrupt circuit, and a pin configured as an output \ncannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the \nstate of the pin does not match the contents of the Input Port register.\nThe INT output has an open-drain structure and requires pull-up resistor to V CCP or V CCI depending on the \napplication. INT should be connected to the voltage source of the device that requires the interrupt information.\n8.3.4 Reset Input ( RESET )\nThe RESET  input can be asserted to initialize the system while keeping the V CCP at its operating level. A \nreset can be accomplished by holding the RESET  pin low for a minimum of t W. The TCA6416A registers and \nI2C/SMBus state machine are changed to their default state once RESET  is low (0). When RESET  is high (1), \nthe I/O levels at the P port can be changed externally or through the controller. This input requires a pull-up \nresistor to V CCI, if no active connection is used.\nwww.ti.comTCA6416A\nSCPS194F – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TCA6416A\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Power-On Reset\nWhen power (from 0 V) is applied to V CCP, an internal power-on reset holds the TCA6416A in a reset condition \nuntil V CCP has reached V POR. At that time, the reset condition is released, and the TCA6416A registers and \nI2C/SMBus state machine initializes to their default states. After that, V CCP must be lowered to below V PORF and \nback up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle.\n8.5 Programming\n8.5.1 I2C Interface\nThe bidirectional I2C bus consists of the serial clock (SCL) and serial data (SDA) lines. Both lines must be \nconnected to a positive supply through a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages of a device. Data \ntransfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\nI2C communication with this device is initiated by a controller sending a Start condition, a high-to-low transition \non the SDA input/output, while the SCL input is high (see Figure 8-3 ). After the Start condition, the device \naddress byte is sent, most significant bit (MSB) first, including the data direction bit (R/ W).\nAfter receiving the valid address byte, this device responds with an acknowledge (ACK), a low on the SDA \ninput/output during the high of the ACK-related clock pulse. The address (ADDR) input of the target device must \nnot be changed between the Start and the Stop conditions.\nOn the I2C bus, only one data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain \nstable during the high pulse of the clock period, as changes in the data line at this time are interpreted as control \ncommands (Start or Stop) (see Figure 8-4 ).\nA Stop condition, a low-to-high transition on the SDA input/output while the SCL input is high, is sent by the \ncontroller (see Figure 8-3 ).\nAny number of data bytes can be transferred from the transmitter to receiver between the Start and the Stop \nconditions. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one ACK bit. The transmitter must release the SDA line before \nthe receiver can send an ACK bit. The device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the ACK \nclock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable low during the high pulse of the ACK-related clock period (see Figure \n8-5). When a target receiver is addressed, it must generate an ACK after each byte is received. Similarly, the \ncontroller must generate an ACK after each byte that it receives from the target transmitter. Setup and hold times \nmust be met to ensure proper operation.\nA controller receiver signals an end of data to the target transmitter by not generating an acknowledge (NACK) \nafter the last byte has been clocked out of the target. This is done by the controller receiver by holding the SDA \nline high. In this event, the transmitter must release the data line to enable the controller to generate a Stop \ncondition.\nSDA\nSCLS P\nStart□Condition Stop□Condition\nFigure 8-3.

Three bits of this data byte state the operation (read or write) \nand the internal registers (input, output, polarity inversion, or configuration) that will be affected.

They act only on read operation. Writes to \nthese registers have no effect. The default value (X) is determined by the externally applied logic level.

The command byte is sent after the address and determines which \nregister receives the data that follows the command byte. There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent \nin one write transmission.\nThe eight registers within the TCA6416A are configured to operate as four register pairs. The four pairs are input \nports, output ports, polarity inversion ports and configuration ports. After sending data to one register, the next \ndata byte is sent to the other register in the pair (see Figure 8-8  and Figure 8-9 ). For example, if the first byte is \nsend to Output Port 1 (register 3), the next byte is stored in Output Port 0 (register 2).\nThere is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this way, each 8-bit register \nmay be updated independently of the other registers.\n1 2 SCL 3 4 5 6 7 8\nSDA A A A Data 0\nR/W\ntpv9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 01 0.7 0.0 Data 1 1.7 1.0 A S010000AD\nDR0 PTarget Address Command Byte Data to Port 0 Data to Port 1\nStart Condition Acknowledge\nFrom Target\nWrite to Port\nData Out from Port 1Data Out from Port 0\nData ValidAcknowledge\nFrom TargetAcknowledge\nFrom Target\ntpv\nFigure 8-8.

Write to Configuration or Polarity Inversion Registers\n8.6.4.2 Reads\nThe bus controller first must send the TCA6416A address with the LSB set to a logic 0 (see Figure 8-6  for device \naddress). The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is accessed.\nAfter a restart, the device address is sent again but, this time, the LSB is set to a logic 1. Data from the register \ndefined by the command byte then is sent by the TCA6416A (see Figure 8-10  and Figure 8-11 ).\nAfter a restart, the value of the register defined by the command byte matches the register being accessed when \nthe restart occurred. For example, if the command byte references Input Port 1 before the restart, and the restart \noccurs when Input Port 0 is being read, the stored command byte changes to reference Input Port 0. The original \ncommand byte is forgotten. If a subsequent restart occurs, Input Port 0 is read first. Data is clocked into the \nregister on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse. After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read, but \nthe data now reflects the information in the other register in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 is read, the next \nbyte read is Input Port 0.\nData is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse. There is no limitation on the number \nof data bytes received in one read transmission, but when the final byte is received, the bus controller must not \nacknowledge the data.\n0000AD\nDR01 S 0A A A\nR/WA\nP NAS 1 MSB LSB\nMSB LSBTarget AddressAcknowledge\nFrom Target\nCommand Byte\nData From Upper\nor Lower Byte \nof Register\nLast ByteDataAcknowledge\nFrom TargetAcknowledge\nFrom TargetTarget AddressData From Lower\nor Upper Byte\nof Register\nFirst ByteData\nNo Acknowledge\nFrom ControllerAcknowledge\nFrom Controller\nAt this moment, controller transmitter\nbecomes controller receiver, and \ntarget receiver becomes targettransmitter.0000AD\nDR01\nR/W\nFigure 8-10.

TI’s customers are responsible for determining \nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nApplications of the TCA6416A will have this device connected as a target to an I2C controller (processor), and \nthe I2C bus may contain any number of other target devices. The TCA6416A will be in a remote location from \nthe controller, placed close to the GPIOs to which the controller needs to monitor or control.\nA typical application of the TCA6416A will operate with a lower voltage on the controller side (VCCI), and a \nhigher voltage on the P-port side (VCCP). The P-ports can be configured as outputs connected to inputs of \ndevices such as enable, reset, power select, the gate of a switch, and LEDs. The P-ports can also be configured \nas inputs to receive data from interrupts, alarms, status outputs, or push buttons.\n9.2 Typical Application\nFigure 9-1  shows an application in which the TCA6416A can be used.\nP00\nADDRP12\nP13\nP14\nP15GNDINTSDASCL\nTCA6416ASDASCL\nINT\nGNDController\nP02P01\nP03\nP04\nP05\nP06\nP07\nP10\nP11\nP16\nP17222\n23\n1\n21\n1224\nRESET3RESETVCCI\nVCC VCCP10 kW 10 kW 10 kW 10 kWVCCPVCCI\nVCCI\nKeypadALARM\nSubsystem 1\n(e.g., Alarm)\nA\nB4\nENABLE510 k  (  7)W´\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20(see Note E) (1.8 V)\nA.

Resistors are required for inputs (on P port) that may float. If a driver to an input will never let the input float, a resistor is not needed. \nOutputs (in the P port) do not need pullup resistors.\nFigure 9-1.

The minimum pull-up resistance is a function of \nVCC, VOL,(max) , and I OL:\nCC OL(max)\np(min)\nOLV V\nRI/c45\n/c61\n(1)\nThe maximum pull-up resistance is a function of the maximum rise time, t r (300 ns for fast-mode operation, f SCL \n= 400 kHz) and bus capacitance, C b:\nr\np(max)\nbtR0.8473 C/c61/c180\n(2)\nThe maximum bus capacitance for an I2C bus must not exceed 400 pF for standard-mode or fast-mode \noperation. The bus capacitance can be approximated by adding the capacitance of the TCA9538, C i for SCL or \nCio for SDA, the capacitance of wires/connections/traces, and the capacitance of additional targets on the bus.\n9.2.2.1 Minimizing I CC When I/Os Control LEDs\nWhen the I/Os are used to control LEDs, normally they are connected to V CC through a resistor as shown in \nFigure 9-2 . For a P-port configured as an input, I CC increases as V I becomes lower than V CC. The LED is a \ndiode, with threshold voltage V T, and when a P-port is configured as an input the LED will be off but V I is a V T \ndrop below V CC.\nFor battery-powered applications, it is essential that the voltage of P-ports controlling LEDs is greater than or \nequal to V CC when the P-ports are configured as input to minimize current consumption. Figure 9-2  shows \na high-value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 9-3  shows V CC less than the LED supply voltage by at \nleast V T. Both of these methods maintain the I/O V I at or above V CC and prevents additional supply current \nconsumption when the P-port is configured as an input and the LED is off.\nwww.ti.comTCA6416A\nSCPS194F – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: TCA6416A\nLED\nLEDxVCC100 kVCCFigure 9-2.

Power-on reset requires that the device go through a power cycle to be completely reset. This \nreset also happens when the device is powered on for the first time in an application.\nRamping up the device V CCP before V CCI is recommended to prevent SDA from potentially being stuck LOW.\nThe two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 10-1  and Figure 10-2 .\nVCC\nRamp-Up Re-Ramp-Up\nTime□to□Re-RampTimeRamp-Down\nVCC_RTVCC_RTVCC_FTVCC_TRR_GND\nFigure 10-1.

By-pass and de-coupling capacitors \nare commonly used to control the voltage on the VCCP pin, using a larger capacitor to provide additional power \nin the event of a short power supply glitch and a smaller capacitor to filter out high-frequency ripple. These \ncapacitors should be placed as close to the TCA6416A as possible. These best practices are shown in Figure \n11-1.\nFor the layout example provided in Figure 11-1 , it would be possible to fabricate a PCB with only 2 layers by \nusing the top layer for signal routing and the bottom layer as a split plane for power (V CCI and V CCP) and ground \n(GND). However, a 4 layer board is preferable for boards with higher density signal routing. On a 4 layer PCB, \nit is common to route signals on the top and bottom layer, dedicate one internal layer to a ground plane, and \ndedicate the other internal layer to a power plane. In a board layout using planes or split planes for power \nand ground, vias are placed directly next to the surface mount component pad which needs to attach to V CCI, \nVCCP, or GND and the via is connected electrically to the internal layer or the other side of the board. Vias are \nalso used when a signal trace needs to be routed to the opposite side of the board, but this technique is not \ndemonstrated in Figure 11-1 .\nwww.ti.comTCA6416A\nSCPS194F – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: TCA6416A\n11.2 Layout Example\nVCCI\nBypass/decoupling\ncapacitors\nINT\nVCCI\nRESET\nP00\nP01\nP02\nP03\nP04\nP05\nP06\nP07\nP10P11P12P13P14P15P16P17SCLSDAVCCP PW packageVia to power planePartial view of plane\nVia to GND planeLEGEND\n(inner layer)\nTo I/Os\nTo I/Os1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n1211109\n131415161314151613141516To processor\nGNDVCCP\nGNDADDR\nTCA6416A\nFigure 11-1.
