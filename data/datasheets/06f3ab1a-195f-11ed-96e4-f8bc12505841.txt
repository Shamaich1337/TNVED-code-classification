It employs the progressive compression \ntechnique over a cascaded amplifier chain, each stage of which \nis equipped with a detector cell. The device can be used in either \nmeasurement or controller modes. The AD8319 maintains accurate log conformance for signals of 1 MHz to 8 GHz and provides useful operation to 10 GHz. The input dynamic r ange \nis typically 4 5 dB (re: 50 Ω ) with error less than ± 3 dB. The \nAD8319 has 6  ns/10 ns (fall time/rise time)  response time that \nenables RF burst detection to a pulse rate of beyond 50 MHz. The device provides unprecedented logarithmic intercept stability  \nvs. ambient temperature conditions. A supply of 3.0 V to 5.5 V is required to power the device. Current consumption is typically  \n22 mA, and it decreases to 200 µ A when the device is disabled.  \nThe AD8319 can be configured to provide a control voltage to  \na power amplifier or a measurement output from the VOUT pin. Because the output can be used for controller applications, \nspecial attention was  paid to minimize wideband noise. In this \nmode, the setpoint control voltage is applied to the VSET pin.  The feed back loop through an RF amplifier is closed via VOUT , \nthe output of which regulates the output of the amplifier to a \nmagnitude  corresponding to V\nSET. The AD8319 provides 0 V to \n(V POS − 0.1 V)  output capability at the VOUT  pin, suitable for \ncontroller appli cations. As a measurement device, VOUT  is \nexternally connected to VSET  to produce an output voltage , \nVOUT, that is a decreasing linear -in-dB function of the RF input \nsignal amplitude.  \nThe logarithmic slope is − 22 mV/dB, determined by the VSET  \ninterface. Th e intercept is 15 dBm (re: 50 Ω , CW input) using \nthe INHI input. These parameters are very stable against supply \nand temperature variations.  \nThe AD8319 is fabricated on a SiGe bipolar IC process and is \navailable in a 2 mm ×  3 mm, 8 -lead LFCSP for an operating  \ntemperature range of − 40°C to +85 °C. \n \n \nAD8319  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

D | Page 10 of 19 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD8319 is a five-stage demodulating logarithmic amplifier, \nspecifically designed for use in RF measurement and power control \napplications at frequencies up to 10 GHz. A block diagram is shown in Figure 21. Sharing much of its design with the AD8318  \nlogarithmic detector/controller, the AD8319 maintains tight intercept variability vs. temperature over a 40 dB range. Additional \nenhancements over the AD8318, such as reduced RF burst \nresponse time of 6 ns to 10 ns, 22 mA supply current, and  \nboard space requirements of only 2 mm × 3 mm add to the low \ncost and high performance benefits found in the AD8319.  \nGAIN\nBIASSLOPE\nDET DET DET DET\nINHI\nINLOIV VOUTVSET\nCLPFTADJ VPSO\nCOMM\n05705-021IV\n \nFigure 21. Block Diagram \nA fully differential design, using a proprietary, high speed  \nSiGe process, extends high frequency performance. Input INHI \nreceives the signal with a low frequency impedance of nominally 500 Ω in parallel with 0.7 pF. The maximum input with ±1 dB log conformance error is typically 0 dBm (re: 50 Ω). The noise spectral density referred to the input is 1.15 nV/√Hz, which is \nequivalent to a voltage of 118 μV rms in a 10.5 GHz bandwidth \nor a noise power of −66 dBm (re: 50 Ω). This noise spectral density sets the lower limit of the dynamic range. However, the low end accuracy of the AD8319 is enhanced by specially shaping the demodulating transfer characteristic to partially compensate for errors due to internal noise. The common pin, COMM, \nprovides a quality low impedance connection to the PCB \nground. The package paddle, which is internally connected  to the COMM pin, should also be grounded to the PCB to \nreduce thermal impedance from the die to the PCB. The logarithmic function is approximated in a piecewise fashion  \nby five cascaded gain stages. (For a detailed explanation of the logarithm approximation, refer to the AD8307  data sheet.) The \ncells have a nominal voltage gain of 9 dB each and a 3 dB \nbandwidth of 10.5 GHz. Using precision biasing, the gain is \nstabilized over temperature and supply variations. The overall dc gain is high due to the cascaded nature of the gain stages.  An offset compensation loop is included to correct for offsets within the cascaded cells. At the output of each of the gain stages, a square-law detector cell is used to rectify the signal.  \nThe RF signal voltages are converted to a fluctuating differential \ncurrent having an average value that increases with signal level. \nAlong with the five gain stages and detector cells, an additional detector is included at the input of the AD8319, providing a 40 dB dynamic range in total. After the detector currents are summed and filtered, the following function is formed at the \nsumming node: \nI\nD × log 10(VIN/VINTERCEPT ) (1) \nwhere:  \nID is the internally set detector current. \nVIN is the input signal voltage. \nVINTERCEPT  is the intercept voltage (that is, when V IN = V INTERCEPT , \nthe output voltage would be 0 V , if it were capable of going to 0 V). \n \n \nData Sheet  AD8319  \n \nRev.

A power supply voltage of between 3.0 V \nand 5.5 V should be applied to VPOS .

Basic Connections  \nThe paddle of the LFCSP is internally connected to COMM.   \nFor optimum thermal and electrical performance, the paddle \nshould be soldered to a low impedance ground plane. \nINPUT SIGNAL  COUPLING  \nThe RF input (INHI) is single -ended and must be ac -coupled. \nINLO (input common) should be ac -coupled to ground. \nSuggested coupling capacitors are 47 nF ceramic 0402- style \ncapacitors for input frequencies of 1 MHz to 10 GHz. The coupling capacitors should be mounted close to the  INHI an d \nINLO  pins. The coupling capacitor values can be increased to \nlower the high- pass cutoff frequency  of the input stage . The \nhigh- pass corner is set by the input coupling capacitors and the \ninternal 10 pF high- pass capacitor. The dc voltage on INHI and \nINLO  is approximately  one diode voltage drop below V\nPOS. 05705-023VPOS\n2kΩ A = 9dB18.7kΩ 18.7kΩCURRENT\nGm\nSTAGEINLOINHI\nOFFSET\nCOM P5pF 5pF\nFIRST\nGAIN\nSTAGE\n \nFigure 23. Input Interface  \nAlthough  the input can be reactively matched, in general , this is not  \nnecessary. An external 52.3 Ω  shunt resistor (connected on the \nsignal side of the input coupling capacitors, as show n in Figure 22) combines with the relatively high input impedance to give an adequate broadband 50 Ω  match.  \nThe coupling time constant, 50 × C\nC/2, forms a high -pass corner  \nwith a 3 dB attenuation at f HP = 1/(2π × 50 × CC ), where C1 = \nC2 = C C. Using the typical value of 47 nF, this high- pass corner \nis ~68 kHz. In high frequency applications, f HP should be as \nlarge as possible to minimize the coupling of unwanted low \nfrequency  signals. In low frequency appli cations, a simple RC \nnetwork forming a low -pass filter should be added at the input \nfor similar reasons. This should generally be placed at the generator  \nside of the coupling capacitors, thereby lowering the required capacitance value for a given high- pass corner frequency.  \nOUTPUT INTERFACE  \nThe VOUT  pin is driven by a PNP output stage. An internal 10 Ω  \nresistor is placed in series with the output and the VOUT  pin. \nThe rise time of the output is limited mainly by the slew on CLPF . The fall time is an RC -limited slew given by the load \ncapacitance and the pull -down resistance at VOUT. There is  \nan internal pull- down resistor of 1.6 kΩ. A resistive load at \nVOUT is placed in parallel with the internal pull -down resistor \nto provide additional discharge current.  \n05705-024+\n0.8V\n1200Ω\n400Ω–10Ω\nVOUTVPOS\nCLPF\nCOMM \nFigure 24. Output Interface  \nTo reduce the fall time, VOUT should be loaded with a resistive load of <1.6 kΩ. For example, with an external load of 150 Ω,  \nthe AD8319 fall time is <7 ns.  \nSETPOINT INTERFACE  \nThe V SET input drives the high impedance input ( 40 kΩ) of an \ninternal op amp. The V SET voltage appears across the internal \n1.5 kΩ resistor to generate I SET. When a portion of V OUT is \napplied to VSET, the feedback loop forces  \n−ID × log 10(VIN/VINTERCEPT ) = I SET (2) \nIf VSET = VOUT/2x, ISET = VOUT/(2x × 1.5 k Ω).  \nThe result is  \nVOUT = (−ID × 1.5 k Ω × 2x) × log 10(VIN/VINTERCEPT ) 05705-0251.5kΩISET\nCOMMVSETVSET\nCOMM20kΩ20kΩ\n \nFigure 25.

The slope is set to −880 m V/decade or \n−44 mV/dB.  \nTEMPERATURE COMPENSATION OF OUTPUT \nVOLTAGE  \nThe primary component of the variation in V OUT vs. temperature,  \nas the input signal amplitude is held constant is the drift of the \nintercept. This drift is also a weak function of the input signal \nfrequency ; therefore,  provision is made for optimization of \ninternal temperature compensation at a given frequency by \nprov iding the TADJ  pin.  \nCOMM COMMICOMPVINTERNAL\nTADJ\nRTADJ\n05705-0261.5kΩAD8319\n \nFigure 26.

The value of \nthis resistor partially determines the magnitude of an analog correction coefficient, which is used to reduce intercept d rift. \nThe relationship between output temperature drift and frequency is not linear and cannot be easily modeled. As a result, experimentation is required to choose the correct  \nTADJ resistor. Table 4 shows the recommended values for  \nsome commonly used frequencies.  \nTable 4.

Typical Output Voltage vs. Input Signal  \nThe output voltage vs. input signal voltage of the AD8319 is linear -in-dB over a multidecade range. The equation for this \nfunction is  \nV\nOUT = X × VSLOPE/DEC  × log 10(VIN/VINTERCEPT ) = \nX × VSLOPE/dB  × 20 × log 10(VIN/VINTERCEPT )  (3) \nwhere:  \nX is the feedback factor in  VSET = VOUT/X. \nVSLOPE/DEC  is nominally −440 mV/decade or − 22 mV/dB.  \nVINTERCEPT  is the x -axis intercept of the linear -in-dB portion of \nthe VOUT vs. PIN curve ( see Figure 27).  \nVINTERCEPT  is 15 dBm ( 2 dBV ) for a sinusoidal input signal.  \nAn offset voltage, V OFFSET , of 0.35 V is internally added to the \ndetector signal, so that the m inimum value for V OUT is  \nX × V OFFSET , so for X = 1, minimum V OUT is 0.35 V .  \nThe slope is very stable vs. process and temperature variation. When base-10 logarithms are used, V\nSLOPE/DEC  represents the \nvolts/decade. A decade corresponds to 20 dB; V SLOPE/DEC /20 = \nVSLOPE/dB  represents the slope in volts/dB.  \nAs noted in the Equation 1 and Equation 2, the V OUT voltage has \na negative  slope. This is also the correct slope polarity to control \nthe gain of many power amplifiers in a negative feedback configu -\nration. Because both the slope and intercept vary slightly with \nfrequency, it is recommended to refer to the Specifications  \nsection for application -specific values for the slope and intercept.  \nAlthough demodulating log amps respond to input signal voltage, not input signal power, it is customary to discuss the amplitude of high frequency signals in terms of power. In this case, the characteristic impedance of the system, Z\n0, must be \nknown to convert voltages to their corresponding power levels. Equation  4 to Equation 6  are used to perform this conversion.  \nP(dBm) = 10 × log\n10(Vrms2/(Z0 × 1 mW))  (4) \nP(dBV) = 20 × log 10(Vrms/1 Vrms) (5) \nP(dBm) = P (dBV) − 10 × log 10(Z0 × 1 mW/1 V rms2) (6) \nData Sheet  AD8319  \n \nRev.

Connecting VOUT directly to VSET yields the nomina l \nlogarithmic slope of −22 mV/dB . The output swing corresponding \nto the specified input range is then 0.35 V to 1.5 V . The slope \nand output swing can be increased by placing a resistor divider between VOUT and VSET  (that is, one resistor from VOUT to \nVSET and one resistor from VSET to gr ound). The input imped -\nance of VSET is 40 k Ω. Slope setting resistors should be kept below  \n20 kΩ to prevent this input impedance from affecting the \nresulting slope. If two equal resistors are used (for example, \n10 kΩ/10 k Ω), the slope doubles to − 44 mV/dB.  05705-028VOUTAD8319\n–44mV/dB\nVSET10kΩ\n10kΩ\n \nFigure 28. Increasing the Slope \nCONTROLLER MODE  \nThe AD8319 provides a controller mode feature at the  VOUT  \npin. Using V SET for the setpoint voltage, it is possible for the \nAD8319 to control subsystems, such as power amplifiers (P As), \nvariable gain amplifiers (VGAs), or variable voltage attenuators \n(VV As) that have output power that increases monotonically with respect to their gain control signal. To operate in controller mode, the link between VSET and VOUT is broken. A setpoint voltage is applied to the VSET input; VOUT is connected to the gain control terminal of the VGA and the RF input of the detector is connected to the output of the VGA (usually using a directional coupler and \nsome additional attenuation). Based on the defin ed relationship \nbetween V\nOUT and the RF input signal when the device is in \nmeasurement mode, the AD8319 adjusts the voltage on VOUT \n(VOUT is now an error amplifier output) until the level at the RF input corresponds to the applied V\nSET. When the AD8319 \noperates in controller mode, there is no defined relation ship \nbetween the VSET and V OUT voltage s; V OUT settles to a value that \nresults in the correct input signal level appearing at INHI/INLO.   \nFor this output power control loop to be stable, a ground -\nreferenced capacitor must be connected to the CLPF pin. This capacitor, C\nFLT, integrates the error signal (in the form of a \ncurrent) to set the loop bandwidth and ensure loop stability. Further details on control loop dynamics can be found in the AD8315 data sheet.   \n05705-029RFIN VGA/V VA\nGAIN\nCONTRO L\nVOLTAGEDIRECTIONA L\nCOUPLER\nATTENU ATOR\nINHI\nVSETINLO\nCLPFVOUT\nAD831952.3Ω47nF\nCFLT47nFDAC\n \nFigure 29.

AD8319 Operating in Controller Mode to Provide Automatic Gain Control Functionality in Combination with the ADL5330 \n \nThe basic connections for operating the AD8319 in an automatic gain control (AGC) loop with the ADL5330  are shown in  \nFigure 30. The ADL5330  is a 10 MHz to 3 GHz VGA. It offers a \nlarge gain control range of 60 dB with ±0.5 dB gain stability. \nThis configuration is similar to Figure 29. \nThe gain of the ADL5330  is controlled by the output pin of the \nAD8319. This voltage, V\nOUT, has a range of 0 V to near V POS. To \navoid overdrive recovery issues, the AD8319 output voltage can \nbe scaled down using a resistive divider to interface with the 0 V \nto 1.4 V gain control range of the ADL5330. \nA coupler/attenuation of 21 dB is used to match the desired \nmaximum output power from the VGA to the top end of the linear operating range of the AD8319 (approximately −5 dBm  \nat 900 MHz). \nFigure 31 shows the transfer function of the output power vs. \nthe V\nSET voltage over temperature for a 900 MHz sine wave with \nan input power of −1.5 dBm. Note that the power control of the \nAD8319 has a negative sense. Decreasing V SET, which corresponds \nto demanding a higher signal from the ADL5330 , increases gain. The AGC loop is capable of controlling signals of ~40 dB. This range limitation is due to the dynamic range of the AD8319. Using a wider dynamic range detector, such as the AD8317, \nAD8318, or AD8362, allows for the full 60 dB range of the ADL5330  to be used. The performance over temperature is \nmost accurate over the highest power range, where it is generally most critical. Across the top 40 dB range of output power, the \nlinear conformance error is well within ±0.5 dB over temperature. \n–50–40–30–100102030OUTPUT POWER (dBm)–20\n–4–301234\n–1\n–2\nERROR (dB)\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\nSETPOINT VOLTAGE (V)1.3 1.1 0 . 30 . 50 . 70 . 9 1 . 5 1 . 6\n05705-031 \nFigure 31.

This functionality is analogous to the \nfeedback capacitor around an integrating amplifier. While it  \nis possible to use large capacitors for C FLT, in most applications, \nvalues under 1 nF provide sufficient filtering. Calibration in controller mode is similar to the method used  \nin measurement mode. A simple two-point calibration can be done by applying two known V\nSET voltages or DAC codes and \nmeasuring the output power from the VGA. Slope and intercept can then be calculated by: \nSlope  = (V\nSET1 − V SET2)/(POUT1 − POUT2) (8) \nIntercept  = POUT1 − VSET1/Slope  (9) \nVSETx = Slope  × (POUTx − Intercept ) (10) \nMore information on the use of the ADL5330  in AGC applications \ncan be found in the ADL5330  data sheet. \nOUTPUT FILTERING \nFor applications in which maximum video bandwidth and, \nconsequently, fast rise time are desired, it is essential that the \nCLPF pin be left unconnected and free of any stray capacitance. \nThe nominal output video bandwidth of 50 MHz can be reduced \nby connecting a ground-referenced capacitor (C FLT) to the CLPF \npin, as shown in Figure 34. This is generally done to reduce output ripple (at twice the input frequency for a symmetric input \nwaveform such as sinusoidal signals). \n+4VOUT\nCLPFAD8319\n3.5pF\n05705-037ILOG\nCFLT1.5kΩ\n \nFigure 34.

A setpoint voltage is applied to  the VSET  pin, the value of which corresponds   \nto the desired RF input signal level applied to the AD8319 RF input. A sample of the RF output   \nsignal from this variable -gain component is selected, typically via a directional coupler, and  \napplied to AD8319 RF input. The voltage at the VOUT  pin is applied to the gain control of the   \nvariable gain element. A control  voltage is applied to the  VSET  pin. The magnitude of the  \ncontrol voltage can optionally be attenuated via the voltage divider comprising R2 and R3, or a  \ncapacitor can be installed in P osition R3 to form a low -pass filter along with R2.
