The maximum speed of the\nSPI-bus is 6.5 Mbit/s.\nThe PCF2129  has a backup battery input pin and backup battery switch-over circuit\nwhich monitors the main power supply. The backup battery switch-over circuit\nautomatically switches to the backup battery when a power failure condition is detected\n(see Section 7.5.1 ). Accurate timekeeping is maintained even when the main power\nsupply is interrupted.\nA battery low detection circuit monitors the status of the battery (see Section 7.5.2 ).\nWhen the battery voltage drops below a certain threshold value, a flag is set to indicate\nthat the battery must be replaced soon. This ensures the integrity of the data during\nperiods of battery backup.\nPCF2129 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

After register 1Bh, the auto-incrementing will wrap around to address 00h\n(see Figure 5 ).\n001aaj398address register\n00h\nauto-increment\nwrap around01h\n02h\n03h\n...\n19h\n1Ah\n1Bh\nFigure 5.\u2007Handling address registers\n•The first three registers (memory address 00h, 01h, and 02h) are used as control\nregisters (see Section 7.2 ).\n•The memory addresses 03h through to 09h are used as counters for the clock function\n(seconds up to years). The date is automatically adjusted for months with fewer than 31\ndays, including corrections for leap years. The clock can operate in 12-hour mode with\nan AM/PM indication or in 24-hour mode (see Section 7.8 ).\n•The registers at addresses 0Ah through 0Eh define the alarm function. It can be\nselected that an interrupt is generated when an alarm event occurs (see Section 7.9 ).\n•The register at address 0Fh defines the temperature measurement period and the\nclock out mode. The temperature measurement can be selected from every 4 minutes\n(default) down to every 30 seconds (see Table 13 ). CLKOUT frequencies of 32.768 kHz\n(default) down to 1 Hz for use as system clock, microcontroller clock, and so on, can be\nchosen (see Table 14 ).\n•The registers at addresses 10h and 11h are used for the watchdog timer functions. The\nwatchdog timer has four selectable source clocks allowing for timer periods from less\nthan 1 ms to greater than 4 hours (see Table 51 ). An interrupt is generated when the\nwatchdog times out.\n•The registers at addresses 12h to 18h are used for the timestamp function. When\nthe trigger event happens, the actual time is saved in the timestamp registers (see\nSection 7.11 ).\n•The register at address 19h is used for the correction of the crystal aging effect (see\nSection 7.4.1 ).\n•The registers at addresses 1Ah and 1Bh are for internal use only.\n•The registers Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Months, and Years are all coded in\nBinary Coded Decimal (BCD) format to simplify application use. Other registers are\neither bit-wise or standard binary.\nWhen one of the RTC registers is written or read, the content of all counters is\ntemporarily frozen. This prevents a faulty writing or reading of the clock and calendar\nduring a carry condition (see Section 7.8.8 ).\nPCF2129 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

In order to compensate the\nspread of the quartz parameters every chip is factory calibrated.\nThe frequency accuracy can be evaluated by measuring the frequency of the square\nwave signal available at the output pin CLKOUT. However, the selection of f CLKOUT\n= 32.768 kHz (default value) leads to inaccurate measurements. Accurate frequency\nmeasurement occurs when f CLKOUT  = 16.384 kHz or lower is selected (see Table 14 ).\n7.3.1.1 Temperature measurement\nThe PCF2129  has a temperature sensor circuit used to perform the temperature\ncompensation of the frequency.

The OTP refresh takes less than 100 ms to complete.\nTo perform an OTP refresh, bit OTPR has to be cleared (set to logic 0) and then set to\nlogic 1 again.\n7.3.3 Clock output\nA programmable square wave is available at pin CLKOUT. Operation is controlled by the\nCOF[2:0] control bits in register CLKOUT_ctl.

When a power failure condition is detected, it automatically switches to the\nbackup battery.\nOne of two operation modes can be selected:\nStandard mode\nthe power failure condition happens when:\nVDD < V BAT AND V DD < V th(sw)bat\nVth(sw)bat  is the battery switch threshold voltage. Typical value is 2.5 V. The battery\nswitch-over in standard mode works only for V DD > 2.5 V\nDirect switching mode\nthe power failure condition happens when V DD < V BAT. Direct switching from V DD to V BAT\nwithout requiring V DD to drop below V th(sw)bat\nWhen a power failure condition occurs and the power supply switches to the battery, the\nfollowing sequence occurs:\n1.The battery switch flag BF (register Control_3) is set logic 1.\n2.An interrupt is generated if the control bit BIE (register Control_3) is enabled (see\nSection 7.12.6 ).\n3.If the control bit BTSE (register Control_3) is logic 1, the timestamp registers store\nthe time and date when the battery switch occurred (see Section 7.11.4 ).\n4.The battery switch flag BF is cleared by command; it must be cleared to clear the\ninterrupt.\nPCF2129 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

That is, setting or reading seconds through to years should be made in one\nsingle access. Failing to comply with this method could result in the time becoming\ncorrupted.\nAs an example, if the time (seconds through to hours) is set in one access and then in a\nsecond access the date is set, it is possible that the time may increment between the two\naccesses. A similar problem exists when reading. A roll-over may occur between reads\nthus giving the minutes from one moment and the hours from the next. Therefore it is\nadvised to read all time and date registers in one access.\n7.9 Alarm function\nWhen one or more of the alarm bit fields are loaded with a valid second, minute, hour,\nday, or weekday and its corresponding alarm enable bit (AE_x) is logic 0, then that\ninformation is compared with the actual second, minute, hour, day, and weekday (see\nFigure 17 ).\nPCF2129 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

When the counter reaches 1, the watchdog timer flag WDTF\n(register Control_2) is set logic 1 and an interrupt is generated.\nThe counter does not automatically reload.\nWhen WD_CD is logic 0 (watchdog timer disabled) and the Microcontroller Unit (MCU)\nloads a watchdog timer value n:\n•the flag WDTF is reset\n•INT is cleared\n•the watchdog timer starts again\nLoading the counter with 0 will:\n•reset the flag WDTF\n•clear INT\n•stop the watchdog timer\nRemark: WDTF is read only and cannot be cleared by command.

The pulse generator for the\nminute or second interrupt operates from an internal 64 Hz clock. It is independent of the\nwatchdog timer. Each of these timers can be enabled by the bits SI (second interrupt)\nand MI (minute interrupt) in register Control_1.\n7.10.5 Clearing flags\nThe flags MSF, AF, and TSFx can be cleared by command. To prevent one flag being\noverwritten while clearing another, a logic AND is performed during the write access. A\nflag is cleared by writing logic 0 while a flag is not cleared by writing logic 1. Writing logic\n1 results in the flag value remaining unchanged.\nTwo examples are given for clearing the flags. Clearing a flag is made by a write\ncommand:\n•Bits labeled with - must be written with their previous values\n•Bits labeled with T have to be written with logic 0\n•WDTF is read only and has to be written with logic 0\nRepeatedly rewriting these bits has no influence on the functional behavior.\nBit Register\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\nControl_2 MSF WDTF TSF2 AF T - - TTable 52.\u2007Flag location in register Control_2\nBit Register\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\nControl_2 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0Table 53.\u2007Example values in register Control_2\nThe following tables show what instruction must be sent to clear the appropriate flag.\nBit Register\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\nControl_2 1 0 1 0 0 0[1]0[1]0Table 54.\u2007Example to clear only AF (bit 4)\n[1] The bits labeled as - have to be rewritten with the previous values.\nPCF2129 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

This allows the source of a system interrupt to be cleared\nimmediately when it is serviced, that is, the system does not have to wait for the\ncompletion of the pulse before continuing; see Figure 24 .

The interrupt is generated as an active signal which follows\nthe status of the watchdog timer flag WDTF (register Control_2). No pulse generation is\npossible for watchdog timer interrupts.\nThe interrupt is cleared when the flag WDTF is reset. WDTF is a read-only bit and cannot\nbe cleared by command. Instructions for clearing it can be found in Section 7.10.5 .\n7.12.4 Alarm interrupts\nGeneration of interrupts from the alarm function is controlled by the bit AIE (register\nControl_2). If AIE is enabled, the INT pin follows the status of bit AF (register Control_2).\nClearing AF immediately clears INT. No pulse generation is possible for alarm interrupts.\nPCF2129 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

If TSIE is enabled, the INT pin follows the status of the flags TSFx. Clearing\nthe flags TSFx immediately clears INT. No pulse generation is possible for timestamp\ninterrupts.\n7.12.6 Battery switch-over interrupts\nGeneration of interrupts from the battery switch-over is controlled by the BIE bit (register\nControl_3). If BIE is enabled, the INT pin follows the status of bit BF in register Control_3\n(see Table 70 ). Clearing BF immediately clears INT. No pulse generation is possible for\nbattery switch-over interrupts.\n7.12.7 Battery low detection interrupts\nGeneration of interrupts from the battery low detection is controlled by the BLIE bit\n(register Control_3). If BLIE is enabled, the INT pin follows the status of bit BLF (register\nControl_3). The interrupt is cleared when the battery is replaced (BLF is logic 0) or when\nbit BLIE is disabled (BLIE is logic 0). BLF is read only and therefore cannot be cleared by\ncommand.\n7.13 External clock test mode\nA test mode is available which allows on-board testing. In this mode, it is possible to set\nup test conditions and control the operation of the RTC.\nThe test mode is entered by setting bit EXT_TEST logic 1 (register Control_1). Then pin\nCLKOUT becomes an input. The test mode replaces the internal clock signal (64 Hz)\nwith the signal applied to pin CLKOUT. Every 64 positive edges applied to pin CLKOUT\ngenerate an increment of one second.\nThe signal applied to pin CLKOUT should have a minimum pulse width of 300 ns and a\nmaximum period of 1\u2009000 ns. The internal clock, now sourced from CLKOUT, is divided\ndown by a 26 divider chain called prescaler (see Table 72 ). The prescaler can be set into\na known state by using bit STOP. When bit STOP is logic 1, the prescaler is reset to 0.\nSTOP must be cleared before the prescaler can operate again.\nPCF2129 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

Thereafter, every 64 positive edges cause a 1 second increment.\nRemark:  Entry into test mode is not synchronized to the internal 64 Hz clock. When\nentering the test mode, no assumption as to the state of the prescaler can be made.\nOperating example:\n1.Set EXT_TEST test mode (register Control_1, EXT_TEST is logic 1).\n2.Set bit STOP (register Control_1, STOP is logic 1).\n3.Set time registers to desired value.\n4.Clear STOP (register Control_1, STOP is logic 0).\n5.Apply 32 clock pulses to CLKOUT.\n6.Read time registers to see the first change.\n7.Apply 64 clock pulses to CLKOUT.\n8.Read time registers to see the second change.\nRepeat 7 and 8 for additional increments.\n7.14 STOP bit function\nThe function of the STOP bit is to allow for accurate starting of the time circuits. STOP\ncauses the upper part of the prescaler (F 9 to F 14) to be held in reset and thus no 1 Hz\nticks are generated. The time circuits can then be set and will not increment until the\nSTOP bit is released. STOP doesn’t affect the CLKOUT signal but the output of the\nprescaler in the range of 32 Hz to 1 Hz (see Figure 26 ).\n001aaj342OSC32768 Hz\nF016384 Hz\nF18192 Hz\nF24096 Hz128 Hz\nF8\nRESF964 Hz\nRESF10LOWER PRESCALER UPPER PRESCALER\nRESF13\nRES\nstop1 Hz tickF14\nFigure 26.\u2007STOP bit functional diagram\nThe lower stages of the prescaler, F 0 to F 8, are not reset and because the I2C-bus and\nthe SPI-bus are asynchronous to the crystal oscillator, the accuracy of restarting the time\ncircuits is between 0 and one 64 Hz cycle (0.484\u2009375 s and 0.500\u2009000 s), see Table 72\nand Figure 27 .\nBit\nSTOPPrescaler bits[1]\nF0 to F 8 - F9 to F 141 Hz tick Time\nhh:mm:ssComment\nClock is running normally\n0 01000011 1-010100 12:45:12 prescaler counting normally\nSTOP bit is activated by user.
