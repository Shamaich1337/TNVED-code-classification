Chip Description\nThis section describes in depth the architecture of the SX1233 low-power, highly integrated transceiver.\n3.1.  Power Supply Strategy\nThe SX1233 employs an advanced power supply scheme, whic h provides stable operating characteristics over the full \ntemperature and voltage range of operation. This includes th e full output power of +17dBm which is maintained from 1.8 to \n3.6 V.\nThe SX1233 can be powered from any low-noise voltage source via pins VBAT1 and VBAT2. Decoupling capacitors should be connected, as suggested in the reference design, on VR_P A, VR_DIG and VR_ANA pins to ensure a correct operation \nof the built-in voltage regulators.\n3.2.  Low Battery Detector\nA low battery detector is also included allowing the ge neration of an interrupt signal in response to passing a \nprogrammable threshold adjust able through the register RegLowBat . The interrupt signal can be mapped to any of the DIO \npins, through the programming of RegDioMapping .\n3.3.  Frequency Synthesis\nThe LO generation on the SX1233 is based  on a state-of-the-art fractional-N PLL. The PLL is fully integrated with \nautomatic calibration.\n3.3.1.  Reference Oscillator\nThe crystal oscillator is the main timing reference of the SX1233 . It is used as a reference for the frequency synthesizer \nand as a clock for the digital processing.\nThe XO startup time, TS_OSC, depends on the actual XTAL be ing connected on pins XTA and XTB. When using the built-\nin sequencer, the SX1233 optimizes the startup time and automa tically triggers the PLL when the XO signal is stable. To \nmanually control the startup time, the us er should either wait for TS_OSC max,  or monitor the signal CLKOUT which will \nonly be made available on the output buffer when a stable XO oscillation is achieved.\nAn external clock can be used to replace the crystal oscillat or, for instance a tight tolerance TCXO. To do so, bit 4 at \naddress 0x59 should be set to 1, and the external clock has to be provided on XTA (pin 4). XTB (pin 5) should be left open. The peak-peak amplitude of the input signal must never e xceed 1.8 V. Please consult your TCXO supplier for an \nappropriate value of decoupling capacitor, C\nD.\nFigure 4.   TCXO ConnectionXTA XTB\n32 MHzTCXONC\nOP\nVcc\nGNDCDVcc\nwww.semtech.com Page 17SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation3.3.2.  CLKOUT Output\nThe reference frequency, or a fraction of it, can be  provided on DIO5 (pin  12) by modifying bits ClkOut  in RegDioMapping2 . \nTwo typical applications of the CLKOUT output include:\n\uf077To provide a clock output for a companion processor, thus sa ving the cost of an addition al oscillator. CLKOUT can be \nmade available in any operation mode except Sleep mode and is automatically enabled at power on reset.\n\uf077To provide an oscillator reference output . Measurement of the CLKOUT signal enab les simple software trimming of the \ninitial crystal tolerance.\nNote to minimize the current consumpti on of the SX1233, please ensure that t he CLKOUT signal is disabled when not \nrequired.\n3.3.3.  PLL Architecture\nThe frequency synthesizer generating the LO frequency for both  the receiver and the transmitter is a fractional-N sigma-\ndelta PLL. The PLL incorporates a third order loop capable of fast auto-calibration, and it has a fast switching-time. The VCO and the loop filter are both fully integrated, removing the need for an external tight-tolerance, high-Q inductor in the \nVCO tank circuit.\n3.3.3.1.  VCO\nThe VCO runs at 2, 4 or 6 times the RF  frequency (respectively in the 915, 43 4 and 315 MHz bands) to reduce any LO \nleakage in receiver mode , to improve the quadratur e precision of the receiv er, and to reduce  the pulling effects on the VCO \nduring transmission.\nThe VCO calibration is fully automated. A coarse adjustment  is carried out at power on reset, and a fine tuning is \nperformed each time the SX1233 PLL is activated. Automatic calib ration times are fully transparent to the end-user, as their \nprocessing time is included in the TS_TE  and TS_RE  specifications.\n3.3.3.2.  PLL Bandwidth\nThe bandwidth of the SX1233 Fractional-N PLL is wide enough to allow for:\n\uf077High speed FSK modulation, up to 300 kb/s, inside the PLL bandwidth\n\uf077Very fast PLL lock times, enabling both short startup and fast hop times required for frequency agile applications\nFor optimized high-speed transmissions please set RegTestPll  to 0x0C.\n3.3.3.3.  Carrier Frequency and Resolution\nThe SX1233 PLL embeds a 19-bit sigma-delta modulator and it s frequency resolution, constant over the whole frequency \nrange, and is given by:\nThe carrier frequency is programmed through RegFrf , split across addresses 0x07 to 0x09:\nNote The Frf setting is split across 3 bytes. A change in the center frequenc y will only be taken into account when the \nleast significant byte FrfLsb in RegFrfLsb is written. This allows for more complex modulation schemes such as m-\nary FSK, where frequency modulation is achieved  by changing the programmed RF frequency.FSTEPFXOSC\n219----------------=\nFRFFSTEPFrf23 0(, ) × =\nwww.semtech.com Page 18SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation3.3.4.  Lock Time\nPLL lock time TS_FS  is a function of a number of technical factors, su ch as synthesized frequency, frequency step, etc. \nWhen using the built-in sequencer, the SX1233 optimizes the st artup time and automatically starts the receiver or the \ntransmitter when the PLL has locked. To manually contro l the startup time, the user should either wait for TS_FS  max given \nin the specification, or monitor the signal PLL lock detect in dicator, which is set when th e PLL has is within its locking \nrange.\nWhen performing an AFC, which usually corrects very small frequency errors, the PLL response time is approximately:\nIn a frequency hopping scheme, the timings TS_HOP given in the table of specifications give an order of magnitude for the \nexpected lock times.\n3.3.5.  Lock Detect Indicator\nA lock indication signal can be made available on some of  the DIO pins, and is toggled high when the PLL reaches its \nlocking range. Please refer to Table  20 and Table  21 to map this interrupt to the desired pins.\nNote The lock detect block may indicate an unlock condition (signal toggling low) when th e transmitter is FSK modulated \nwith large frequency deviation settings.TPLLAFC5\nPLLBW------------------- - =\nwww.semtech.com Page 19SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation3.4.

Bit Rate Setting\nWhen using the SX1233 in Continuous mode, the data stream to be transmitted can be input directly to the modulator via \npin 9 (DIO2/DATA) in an asynchronous manne r, unless Gaussian filtering is used, in  which case the DCLK signal on pin 10 \n(DIO1/DCLK) is used to synchron ize the data stream. See section 3.4.5  for details on the Gaussian filter.\nIn Packet mode or in Continuous mode with Gaussian filtering enabl ed (refer to section 5.5 for details), the Bit Rate (BR) is \ncontrolled by bits BitRate  in RegBitrate :\nAmongst others, the following Bit Rates are accessible:LNA\nReceiver Chain RFIO\nLocal\nOscillatorPA0\nPA1\nPA2PA_BOOST\nBRFXOSC\nBitRate------------------- - =\nwww.semtech.com Page 20SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech CorporationTable 9 Bit Rate Examples\n3.4.3.

OOK Modulation\nOOK modulation is applied by switching on and off the Powe r Amplifier. Digital control and smoothing are available to \nimprove the transient power response of the OOK transmitter.\n3.4.5.  Modulation Shaping\nModulation shaping can be applied in both OOK and FSK modulation modes, to improve the narrowband response of the transmitter. Both shaping features are controlled with PaRamp  bits in RegPaRamp .\n\uf077In FSK mode, a Gaussian filter with BT = 0.3, 0.5 or 1 is used to filter the modulation stream, at the input of the sigma-\ndelta modulator. If the Gaussian filter  is enabled when the SX1233 is in C ontinuous mode, DCLK signal on pin 10 \n(DIO1/DCLK) will trigger an interr upt on the uC each time a new bit has to be transmitted. Please refer to section 5.4.2 \nfor details.\n\uf077When OOK modulation is used, the PA bias voltages are ra mped up and down smoothly when the PA is turned on and \noff, to reduce spectral splatter.\nNote the transmitter must be restarted if the ModulationShap ing setting is changed, in order to recalibrate the built-in \nfilter.\n3.4.6.  Power Amplifiers\nThree power amplifier blocks are embedded in the SX1233. The first one, herein referred to as PA0, can generate up to +13 dBm into a 50 Ohm load. PA0 shares a common front-end pin RFIO (pin 21) with the receiver LNA.\nPA1 and PA2 are both connected to pin PA_BOOST (p in 23), allowing for two distinct power ranges:\n\uf077A low power mode, where -18 dBm < Pout < 13 dBm, with PA1 enabled\n\uf077A higher power mode, when PA1 and PA2 are combined, providing up to +17 dBm to a matched load.\nWhen PA1 and PA2 are combined to deliver +17 dBm to the an tenna, a specific impedance matching / harmonic filtering \ndesign is required to ensure impedance transformation and regulatory compliance.\nAll PA settings are controlled by RegPaLevel , and the truth table of settings is given in Table  10.\nTable 10 Power Amplifier Mode Selection Truth Table\nNotes - To ensure correct operation at the highest power leve ls, please make sure to adjust the Over Current Protection \nLimit accordingly in RegOcp.

Receiver Description\nThe SX1233 features a digital receiver wit h the analog to digital conversion proc ess being performed di rectly following the \nLNA-Mixers block. The zero-IF receiver  is able to handle (G)FSK and (G)MSK modulation. ASK and OOK modulation is, \nhowever, demodulated by a low-IF architecture. All the filter ing, demodulation, gain control, synchronization and packet \nhandling is performed digitally, which allows a very wide range of bit rates and frequency deviations to be selected. The \nreceiver is also capable of automa tic gain calibration in order to im prove precision on RSSI measurements.\n3.5.1.  Block Diagram\nFigure 7.   Receiver Block Diagram\nThe following sections give a brief description of each of the receiver blocks.\n3.5.2.  LNA - Single to Differential Buffer\nThe LNA uses a common-gate topology, which allows for a flat  characteristic over the whole frequency range. It is \ndesigned to have an input impedance of 50 Oh ms or 200 Ohms (as selected with bit LnaZin in RegLna) , and the parasitic \ncapacitance at the LNA input port is canceled with the external RF  choke. A single to differential buffer is implemented to \nimprove the second order linearity of the receiver.\nThe LNA gain, including the single-to-differential buffer, is pr ogrammable over a 48 dB dynami c range, and control is either \nmanual or automatic with th e embedded AGC function.\nNote In the specific case where the LNA ga in is manually set by the user, the rece iver will not be able  to properly handle \nFSK signals with a modulation index smaller than 2 at an  input power greater than the 1dB compression point, \ntabulated in section 3.5.3.\nTable 11 LNA Gain Settings\nLnaGainSelect LNA Gain Gain Setting\n000 Any of the below, set by the AGC loop -\n001 Max gain G1\n010 Max gain - 6 dB G2\n011 Max gain - 12 dB G3\n100 Max gain - 24 dB G4\n101 Max gain - 36 dB G5\n110 Max gain - 48 dB G6\n111 Reserved -LNA\nSingle to\nDifferentialMixersΣ/Δ\nModulators\nDecimator\nRSSI\nAFCRFIOFSK\nDemodulator\nFrom\nPA1\nLocal\nOscillatorChannel\nFilterDC\nCancellationRx Calibration\nReference\nBypassed\nin FSKPhase\nOutput\nModule\nOutputComplex\nFilterCORDIC\nOOK\nDemodulator\nProcessing\nAGC\nwww.semtech.com Page 24SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation3.5.3.  Automatic Gain Control\nBy default ( LnaGainSelect = 000 ), the LNA gain is controlled by a digital AGC loop in order to obtain the optimal sensitivity/\nlinearity trade-off.\nRegardless of the data transfer mode (Packet or Continuous),  the following series of events takes place when the receiver \nis enabled:\n\uf077The receiver stays in WAIT mode, until RssiValue  exceeds RssiThreshold  for two consecutive samples. Its power \nconsumption is the receiver power consumption.\n\uf077When this condition is satisfied, the receiver automatically  selects the most suitable LNA gain, optimizing the sensitivity/\nlinearity trade-off.\n\uf077The programmed LNA gain, read-accessible with LnaCurrentGain  in RegLna , is carried on for the whole duration of the \npacket, until one of the followi ng conditions is fulfilled:\n\uf077Packet mode:  if AutoRxRestartOn = 0,  the LNA gain will remain the same for th e reception of the following packet. If \nAutoRxRestartOn = 1 , after the controller has emptie d the FIFO the receiver will re- enter the WAIT mode described \nabove, after a delay of InterPacketRxDelay , allowing for the distant transmitter to  ramp down, hence avoiding a false \nRSSI detection. In both cases (AutoRxRestartOn=0 or AutoRxRestartOn=1), the receiver can also re-enter the WAIT mode by setting RestartRx  bit to 1. The user can decide to do so, to manually launch a new AGC procedure.\n\uf077Continuous mode:  upon reception of valid data, the user can decide to  either leave the receiver enabled with the same \nLNA gain, or to restart the procedure, by setting RestartRx  bit to 1, resuming the WAIT mode of the receiver, described \nabove.\n \nNotes - the AGC procedure must be performed while receiving preamble in FSK mode\n- in OOK mode, the AGC will give better results if performed while re ceiving a constant “1” sequence\nThe following figure illust rates the AGC behavior:\nFigure 8.

RssiThreshold Setting\nFor correct operation of the AGC, RssiThreshold  in RegRssiThresh  must be set to the sensit ivity of the receiver. The \nreceiver will remain in  WAIT mode until RssiThreshold  is exceeded.\nNote When AFC is enabled and performed automatically at the receiver startup, the channel filter used by the receiver \nduring the AFC and the AGC is RxBwAfc instead of the stand ard RxBw setting. This may impact the sensitivity of \nthe receiver, and the setting of RssiThreshold accordingly\n3.5.3.2.  AGC Reference\nThe AGC reference level is automatically computed in the SX1233, according to:\nAGC Reference [dBm]  = -174 + NF + DemodSnr +10.log(2* RxBw ) + FadingMargin    [dBm]\nWith:\n\uf077NF = 7dB                     : LNA’s Noise Figure at maximum gain\n\uf077DemodSnr  = 8 dB        : SNR needed by the demodulator\n\uf077RxBw                           : Single sideband channel filter bandwidth\n\uf077FadingMargin = 5 dB   : Fading margin\n3.5.4.  Continuous-Time DAGC\nIn addition to the automatic gain control described in section 3.5.3 , the SX1233 is capable of continuously adjusting its gain \nin the digital domain, after the analog to digital conversion ha s occurred. This feature, named DAGC, is fully transparent to \nthe end user. The digital gain adjustment is repea ted every 2 bits, and has the following benefits:\n\uf077Fully transparent to the end user\n\uf077Improves the fading margin of the receiver during the rece ption of a packet, even if the gain of the LNA is frozen\n\uf077Improves the receiver robustness in fast fading signal condit ions, by quickly adjusting the receiver gain (every 2 bits)\n\uf077Works in Continuous, Packet, and unlimited length Packet modes\nThe DAGC is enabled by setting RegTestDagc  to 0x20 for low modulation  index systems (i.e. when AfcLowBetaOn =1, \nrefer to section 3.5.16 ), and 0x30 for other systems. See section 9.1 for details.

Quadrature Mixer - ADCs - Decimators\nThe mixer is inserted between output of the RF buffer stage and the input of the analog to digital converter (ADC) of the \nreceiver section. This block is designed to translate the spectr um of the input RF signal to base-band, and offer both high \nIIP2 and IIP3 responses. \nIn the lower bands of operation (290 to 510 MHz), the multi- phase mixing architecture with weighted phases improves the \nrejection of the LO harmonics in receiver mode, hence incr easing the receiver immunity to out-of-band interferers.\nThe I and Q digitalization is made by two 5th order continuous-time Sigma-Delta Anal og to Digital Converters (ADC). Their \ngain is not constant over temperature, but the whole receiver is calibrated before reception, so that this inaccuracy has no \nimpact on the RSSI precision . The ADC output is one bit per channel. It need s to be decimated and filtered afterwards. This \nADC can also be used for temperature measurement, please refer to section 3.5.17  for more details.\nThe decimators decrease the sample rate of the incoming sign al in order to optimize the area and power consumption of \nthe following receiver blocks.\n3.5.6.  Channel Filter\nThe role of the channel filter is to filt er out the noise and interferers outside of  the channel. Channel filtering on the SX12 33 \nis implemented with a 16-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, providing an outstandi ng Adjacent Chan nel Rejection \nperformance, even for narrowband applications.\nNote to respect oversampling rules in the decimation chain of the receiver, the Bit Rate cannot be set at a higher value \nthan 2 times the single-side receiv er bandwidth (Bit Rate < 2 x RxBw)\nThe single-side channel filter bandwidth RxBw  is controlled by the parameters RxBwMant and RxBwExp  in RegRxBw:\n\uf077When FSK modulation is enabled:\n\uf077When OOK modulation is enabled:\nThe following channel filter b andwidths are accessible (oscilla tor is mandated at 32 MHz):\nTable 13 Available RxBw Settings\nRxBwMant\n(binary/value)RxBwExp\n(decimal)RxBw (kHz)\nFSK\nModulationType=00OOK\nModulationType=01\n10b / 24 7 2.6 1.3\n01b / 20 7 3.1 1.6\n00b / 16 7 3.9 2.0\n10b / 24 6 5.2 2.601b / 20 6 6.3 3.1\n00b / 16 6 7.8 3.9\n10b / 24 5 10.4 5.201b / 20 5 12.5 6.3\n00b / 16 5 15.6 7.8\n10b / 24 4 20.8 10.4RxBwFXOSC\nRxBwMant 2RxBwExp 2+×----------------------------------------------------------------- - =\nRxBwFXOSC\nRxBwMant 2RxBwExp 3+×----------------------------------------------------------------- - =\nwww.semtech.com Page 27SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation3.5.7.  DC Cancellation\nDC cancellation is required in zero-IF architecture transceivers to remove any  DC offset generated through self-reception. \nIt is built-in the SX1231 and its adjustable cutoff frequency fc is controlled in RegRxBw :\nTable 14 Available DCC Cutoff Frequencies\nThe default value of DccFreq  cutoff frequency is typically 4% of the RxBw (channel filter BW). The cutoff frequency of the \nDCC can however be increased to slightly impr ove the sensitivity, under wider modulation conditio ns. It is advised to adjust \nthe DCC setting while monitori ng the receiver sensitivity.\n3.5.8.  Complex Filter - OOK\nIn OOK mode the SX1233 is modified to a lo w-IF architecture. The IF frequency is aut omatically set to half the single side \nbandwidth of the channel filter (FIF = 0.5 x RxBw ). The Local Oscillator is automatically offset by the IF in the OOK receiver. \nA complex filter is implemented on the chip to attenu ate the resulting image frequency by typically 30 dB.\nNote this filter is au tomatically bypassed when receivin g FSK signals (ModulationType = 00  in RegDataModul).\n3.5.9.  RSSI\nThe RSSI block evaluates the amount of en ergy available within the receiver channel bandwidth. Its resolution is 0.5 dB, \nand it has a wide dynamic range to accommodate both small an d large signal levels that may be present. Its acquisition \ntime is very short, taking only 2 bit periods. The RSSI sampli ng must occur during the reception of preamble in FSK, and \nconstant “1” reception in OOK.01b / 20 4 25.0 12.5\n00b / 16 4 31.3 15.6\n10b / 24 3 41.7 20.801b / 20 3 50.0 25.0\n00b / 16 3 62.5 31.3\n10b / 24 2 83.3 41.701b / 20 2 100.0 50.0\n00b / 16 2 125.0 62.5\n10b / 24 1 166.7 83.301b / 20 1 200.0 100.0\n00b / 16 1 250.0 125.0\n10b / 24 0 333.3 166.701b / 20 0 400.0 200.0\n00b / 16 0 500.0 250.0\nDccFreq\nin RegRxBwfc in\n% of RxBw\n000 16\n001 8\n010 (default) 4\n011 2\n100 1\n101 0.5\n110 0.25\n111 0.125\nwww.semtech.com Page 28SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech CorporationNote - RssiValue can only be read when it exceeds RssiThreshold\n- RssiStart  command and RssiDone flags are not usable when DAGC is turned on, see section 3.5.4.- The receiver is capable of automatic gain calibration, in  order to improve the precision of its RSSI measurements. \nThis function injects a known RF signal at the LNA in put, and calibrates the receiver gain accordingly. This \ncalibration is automatically performed during the PLL st art-up, making it a transparent process to the end-user\n- RSSI accuracy depends on all components located between the antenna port and pin RFIO, and is therefore \nlimited to a few dB. Board-level calibration is advised to further improve accuracy\nFigure 9.   RSSI Dynamic Curve\n3.5.10.

FSK Demodulator\nThe FSK demodulator of the SX1233 is designed to demodula te FSK, GFSK, MSK and GMSK modulated signals. It is \nmost efficient when the modulation index of the signal is greater than 0.5 and below 10:\nThe output of the FSK demodulator can be fed to  the Bit Synchronizer (described in section 3.5.13 ), to provide the \ncompanion processor with a synchronous data stream in Continuous mode.\n3.5.12.  OOK Demodulator\nThe OOK demodulator performs a comparison of the RSSI outpu t and a threshold value. Three different threshold modes \nare available, configured through bits OokThreshType  in RegOokPeak .\nThe recommended mode of operation is  the "Peak" threshold mode, illustrated in Figure  11:\nFigure 11.   OOK Peak Demodulator Description\nIn peak threshold mode the comparison threshold level is the peak value of the RSSI, reduc ed by 6dB. In the absence of \nan input signal, or during the reception of a logical "0", the acquired peak value is decremented by one OokPeakThreshStep  every OokPeakThreshDec  period.\nWhen the RSSI output is null for a long time (for instance after a long string of "0" received, or  if no transmitter is present ), \nthe peak threshold level will continue  falling until it reaches the "F loor Threshold", programmed in OokFixedThresh .\nThe default settings of the OOK demodulator lead to the perfor mance stated in the electrical  specification. However, in \napplications in which sudden signal drops are awaited duri ng a reception, the three parameters should be optimized \naccordingly.0.5 β≤2FDEV×\nBR---------------------- 10≤ =\nZoom \nPeriod as defined in \nOokPeakThreshDec Decay in dB as defined in \nOokPeakThreshStep Fixed 6dB difference RSSI \n[dBm] \nNoise floor of \nreceiver ‘’Floor’’ threshold defined by \nOokFixedThresh \nTime ‘’Peak -6dB’’ Threshold\nZoom \nwww.semtech.com Page 30SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation3.5.12.1.  Optimizing the Floor Threshold\nOokFixedThresh  determines the sensitivity of the OOK receiver, as it  sets the comparison thres hold for weak input signals \n(i.e. those close to the noise floor). Significant sensitiv ity improvements can be gener ated if configured correctly.\nNote that the noise floor of the receiver at the demodulator input depends on:\n\uf077The noise figure of the receiver.\n\uf077The gain of the receive chain from antenna to base band.\n\uf077The matching - including SAW filter if any.\n\uf077The bandwidth of the channel filters.\nIt is therefore important to note that the setting of OokFixedThresh  will be application depende nt. The followi ng procedure \nis recommended to optimize OokFixedThresh .\nFigure 12.   Floor Threshold Optimization\nThe new floor threshold value found during this test should be used for OOK reception wi th those receiver settings.\n3.5.12.2.  Optimizing OOK Demodul ator for Fast Fading Signals\nA sudden drop in signal strength can cause the bit error rate to increase. For applications where the expected signal drop \ncan be estimated, the following OOK demodulator parameters OokPeakThreshStep  and OokPeakThreshDec  can be \noptimized as described below for a given number of threshold decrements per bit. Refer to RegOokPeak  to access those \nsettings.\n3.5.12.3.  Alternative OOK Demodulator Threshold Modes\nIn addition to the Peak OOK threshold mode, the user can alternatively select two other types of threshold detectors:\n\uf077Fixed Threshold: The value is selected through OokFixedThresh\n\uf077Average Threshold: Data supplied by the RSSI block is av eraged, and this operation mode should only be used with \nDC-free encoded data. \nSet SX1233 in OOK Rx mode \nAdjust Bit Rate, Channel filter BW \nDefault OokFixedThresh  setting \nNo input signal \nContinuous Mode\n \nOptimization complete  \nGlitch activity \non DAT A? \nMonitor DIO2/DATA pin \nIncrement \nOokFixedThresh  \nwww.semtech.com Page 31SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation3.5.13.  Bit Synchronizer\nThe Bit Synchronizer is a block that provi des a clean and synchronized digital output, free of glitches. Its output is made \navailable on pin DIO1/DCLK in Continuous mode and can be di sabled through register settings. However, for optimum \nreceiver performance its use when running  Continuous mode is strongly advised.\nThe Bit Synchronizer is automatically activated in Packet mode. Its bit rate is controlled by BitRateMsb  and BitRateLsb  in \nRegBitrate.\nFigure 13.   Bit Synchronizer Description\nTo ensure correct operation of the Bit Synchronizer , the following conditions have to be satisfied:\n\uf077A preamble (0x55 or 0xAA) of at least 12 bits is required for synchronization, the longer the synchronization the better \nthe packet success rate\n\uf077The subsequent payload bit stream must have at least one tran sition form \'0\' to \'1\' or \'1\' to  \'0 every 16 bits during data \ntransmission\n\uf077The bit rate matching between the transmitter and the receiver must be better than 6.5%.\n3.5.14.  Frequency Error Indicator\nThis function provides information about the frequ ency error of the local oscillator (LO)  compared with the carrier frequency \nof a modulated signal at the input of the receiver. When the FE I block is launched, the frequency error is measured and the \nsigned result is loaded in FeiValue  in RegFei , in 2’s complement format. The time required for an FEI evaluation is 4 times \nthe bit period.\nTo ensure a proper behavior of the FEI:\n\uf077The operation must be done during the reception of preamble\n\uf077The sum of the frequency offset and the 20 dB signal b andwidth must be lower than the base band filter bandwidth \nRaw demodulator \noutput \n(FSK or OOK) \nDCLK DATA \nBitSync Output \nTo pin DATA and \nDCLK in continuous \nmode \n\nwww.semtech.com Page 32SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech CorporationThe 20 dB bandwidth of the signal can be evaluated as follows (double-side bandwidth):\nThe frequency error, in Hz, can be calculated with the following formula:\nFigure 14.   FEI Process\n3.5.15.  Automatic Frequency Correction\nThe AFC is based on the FEI block, and therefore the same input signal and receiver setting conditions apply. When the \nAFC procedure is done, AfcValue  is directly subtracted to the register that defines the frequency of operation of the chip, \nFRF. The AFC can be launched:\n\uf077Each time the receiver is enabled, if AfcAutoOn  = 1\n\uf077Upon user request, by setting bit AfcStart  in RegAfcFei , if AfcAutoOn  = 0\nWhen the AFC is automatically triggered ( AfcAutoOn = 1), the user has the option to:\n\uf077Clear the former AFC correction value, if AfcAutoClearOn  = 1\n\uf077Start the AFC evaluation from the previously corrected frequen cy. This may be useful in sys tems in which the LO keeps \non drifting in the “same direction”. Ageing compensation is a good example.\nThe SX1233 offers an alternate receiver bandwidth setting during the AFC phase, to accommodate large LO drifts. If the \nuser considers that the received signal may be out of the receiver bandwidth, a higher channel filter bandwidth can be \nprogrammed in RegAfcBw , at the expense of the receiver noise floor, whic h will impact upon sensitivity.BW20dB2 FDEVBR\n2-------+\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0e6\uf0f6×=\nFEI FSTEPFeiValue× =\nSX1239 in Rx mode\nPreamble-modulated input signal\nSignal level > Sensitivity\nSet FeiStart\n= 1\nFeiDone\n= 1No\nYes\nRead\nFeiValue3\nwww.semtech.com Page 33SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation3.5.16.  Optimized Setup for Low Modulation Index Systems\n\uf077For wide band systems, where AFC is usually not required (XTAL inaccuracies do not typically impact the sensitivity), it \nis recommended to offset the LO frequency of the receiver to avoid desensitization. Th is can be simply done by \nmodifying Frf in RegFrfLsb . A good rule of thumb is to offset the rece iver’s LO by 10% of the expected transmitter \nfrequency deviation.\n\uf077For narrow band systems, it is recommended to perf orm AFC. The SX1233 has a dedicated AFC, enabled when \nAfcLowBetaOn in RegAfcCtrl  is set to 1. A frequency offset, programmable through LowBetaAfcOffset  in RegTestAfc , is \nadded and is calculated as follows:\nOffset = LowBetaAfcOffset  x 488 Hz\nThe user should ensure that the programmed offset exceeds the DC canceler’s cutoff frequency, set through DccFreqAfc  in \nRegAfcBw.\nFigure 15.   Optimized AFC (AfcLowBetaOn=1)\nAs shown on Figure  15, a standard AFC sequence uses the result of t he FEI to correct the LO frequency and align both \nlocal oscillators. When the optimized AFC is enabled ( AfcLowBetaOn=1 ), the receiver’s LO is corrected by “ FeiValue  + \nLowBetaAfcOffset ”.\nWhen the optimized AFC routine is enabled, the receiver st artup time can be computed as follows (refer to section 4.2.3 ):\nTS_RE_AGC&AFC (optimized AFC) = Tana + 4.Tcf + 4.Tdcc + 3. Trssi + 2.Tafc + 2.Tpllafc\n3.5.17.  Temperature Sensor\nWhen temperature is measured, the receiv er ADC is used to digitize the sens or response. Most receiver blocks are \ndisabled, and temperature measurement can only be triggered in Standby or Frequency Synthesizer modes.\nThe response of the temperature sensor is -1 °C / Lsb. A CMOS temperature sensor is not accurate by nat ure, therefore it \nshould be calibrated at ambient temperature for precise temperature readings.fTX RX\nfRX&TX\nStandard AFC\nAfcLowBetaOn = 0\nfTX RX TXRX\nLowBetaAfcOffset\nfAfcValueAfcValue FeiValue\nFeiValueOptimized AFC\nAfcLowBetaOn = 1\nBefore AFC After AFC\nwww.semtech.com Page 34SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech CorporationFigure 16.

High Bit Rate Operations\nHigh Bit rate operation is available in FSK mode. For operations in high bit rate, the frequency deviation should respect the \nfollowing equation:      FDA + BRF/2 =<500kHz, where FDA is the Frequency Deviation and BR is the Bit Rate.\n3.6.1.  500kbps Operation\nFor operation at 500kbps, the following settings are recommended:\n\uf077FDA = 250kHz, where FDA is the Frequency Deviation (FSK operatio n with a Modulation index of 1)\n\uf077Crystal should be selected for a ma ximum of +/- 20ppm frequency stability.\n\uf077Carrier frequency of the receiver should be programmed wit h 50kHz offset from the programmed carrier frequency of \ntransmitter. This offset takes into  account the possible +/-20ppm drifts of Crystals. No AFC is needed.\n3.6.2.  600kbps Operation\nFor operation at 600kbps, the following settings are recommended:\n\uf077FDA = 150kHz, where FDA is the Fr equency Deviation (FSK operation with a Modulation index of 0.5)\n\uf077Crystal should be selected for a ma ximum of +/- 15ppm frequency stability.\n\uf077Carrier frequency of the receiver should be programmed wit h 40kHz offset from the programmed carrier frequency of \ntransmitter. This offset takes into  account the possible +/-15ppm drifts of Crystals. No AFC is needed.\nNote for both 500 and 600kbps operations, RegTestPll must be set to 0x0C.\nwww.semtech.com Page 36SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation4.  Operating Modes\n4.1.  Basic Modes\nThe circuit can be set in 5 different basic modes which are described in Table  15. \nBy default, when switching from a mode to another one, the sub-blocks are woken up according to a pre-defined and \noptimized sequence. Alternatively, these operating modes can be selected directly by disabling the automatic sequencer \n(SequencerOff  in RegOpMode = 1 ).\nTable 15 Basic Transceiver Modes\n4.2.  Automatic Sequencer and Wake-Up Times\nBy default, when switching from one operat ing mode to another, the circuit takes care  of the sequence of events in such a \nway that the transition timing is optimized. For example, w hen switching from Sleep mode to Transmit mode, the SX1233 \ngoes first to Standby mode (XO started), then to frequency synthesizer mode, and finally, when the PLL has locked, to transmit mode. Entering transmit mode is also made accordin g to a predefined sequence starting with the wake-up of the \nPA regulator before applying a ramp-up on the PA and generating the DCLK clock.\n\uf077The crystal oscillator wake-up time, TS_OSC , is directly related to the time for th e crystal oscillator to reach its steady \nstate. It depends notably on the crystal characteristics.\n\uf077The frequency synthesizer wake-up time, TS _FS, is directly related to the time needed by the PLL to reach its steady \nstate. The signal PLL_LOCK, provided on an external pin, give s an indication of the lock status. It goes high when the \nPLL reaches its locking range.\nFour specific cases can be highlighted:\n\uf077Transmitter Wake Up time from Sleep mode                                          = TS_OSC + TS_FS + TS_TR\n\uf077Receiver Wake Up time from Sleep mode                                             = TS_OSC + TS_FS + TS_RE\n\uf077Receiver Wake Up time from Sleep mode, AGC enabled                     = TS_OSC + TS_FS + TS_RE_AGC\n\uf077Receiver Wake Up time from Sleep mode, AGC and AFC enabled      =  TS_OSC + TS_FS + TS_RE_AGC&AFC\nThese timings are detailed in sections 4.2.1  and 4.2.3 .\nIn applications where the target average power consumption, or the target startup time, do not require setting the SX1233 \nin the lowest power modes (Sleep or Standby), the respective timings TS_OSC  and TS_FS  in the former equations can be \nomitted.ListenOn\nin RegOpModeMode\nin RegOpModeSelected mode Enabled blocks\n0 0 0 0 Sleep Mode None\n0 0 0 1 Stand-by Mode Top regulator and crystal oscillator0 0 1 0 FS Mode Frequency synthesizer\n0 0 1 1 Transmit Mode Frequency synthesizer and transmitter\n0 1 0 0 Receive Mode Frequency synthesizer and receiver1 x Listen Mode See Listen Mode, section 4.3\nwww.semtech.com Page 37SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation4.2.1.  Transmitter Startup Time\nThe transmitter wake-up time, TS_TR, is given by the sequence c ontrolled by the digital part. It is a pure digital delay which \ndepends on the bit rate and the ramp-up time. In FSK mode, this time can be derived from the following equation.\n,\nwhere PaRamp  is the ramp-up time programmed in RegPaRamp  and Tbit is the bit time.\nIn OOK mode, this equation can be simplified to the following:\nFigure 17.   Tx Startup, FSK and OOK\n4.2.2.  Tx Start Procedure\nAs described in the former section, ModeReady and TxReady  interrupts warn the uC that the transmitter is ready to \ntransmit data\n\uf077In Continuous mode , the preamble bits preceding the payload can be applied on the DIO2/DATA pin immediately after \nany of these interrupts have fired. The DCLK signal, activa ted on pin DIO1/DCLK can also be used to start toggling the \nDATA pin, as described on Figure 30.\n\uf077In Packet mode , the SX1233 will automatically modulate the RF signal with preamble bytes as soon as TxReady or  \nModeReady  happen. The actual packet transmission (start ing with the number of preambles specified in PreambleSize ) \nwill start when the TxStartCondition  is fulfilled.\n4.2.3.  Receiver Startup Time\nIt is highly recommended to use the built -in sequencer of the SX1233, to optimize  the delays when setting the chip in \nreceive mode. It guarantees the shortest startup times, he nce the lowest possible energy usage, for battery operated \nsystems.\nThe startup times of the receiver can be calculated from the following:Tbit PaRamp s TR TS ×+ × + =2125.1 5 _ μ\nTbit s TR TS ×+ =215 _ μ\nAnalog\ngroup delay0.5 x Tbit1.25 x PaRamp\n(only in FSK\nmode)XO Started and PLL is locked\n5 usTransmission of Packet\nModeReady\nTxReadyTS_TRTx startup request\n(sequencer or user)\nwww.semtech.com Page 38SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech CorporationFigure 18.

Optimized Frequency Hopping Sequences\nIn a frequency hopping-like application, it is required to tu rn off the transmitter when hopping from one channel to another, \nto avoid spectral splatter and obtain the best spectral purity.\n\uf077Transmitter hop from Ch A to Ch B:  it is advised to step through the Rx mode:\n(0) SX1233 is in Tx mode in Ch A\n(1) Program the SX1233 in Rx mode\n(2) Change the carrier frequency in the RegFrf  registers\n(3) Turn the transceiver back to Tx mode\n(4) Respect the Tx start procedure, described in section 4.2.2\n\uf077Receiver hop from Ch A to Ch B:\n(0) SX1233 is in Rx mode in Ch A\n(1) Change the carrier frequency in the RegFrf  registers \n(2) Program the SX1233 in FS mode\n(3) Turn the transcei ver back to Rx mode\n(4) Respect the Rx start procedure, described in section 4.2.4\nNote all sequences described above are assuming that th e sequencer is turned on (SequencerOff=0 in RegOpMode).\nwww.semtech.com Page 40SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation4.3.  Listen Mode\nThe circuit can be set to Listen mode, by setting ListenOn  in RegOpMode  to 1 while in Standby mode. In this mode, \nSX1233 spends most of the time in Idle mode, during which only the RC oscillator runs. Periodically the receiver is woken \nup and listens for an RF signal. If a wanted signal is dete cted, the receiver is kept on and the data is demodulated.\nOtherwise, if a wanted signal hasn\'t been de tected after a pre-defined period of time, the receiver is disabled until the next \ntime period.\nThis periodical Rx wake-up requirement is  very common in low power applications. On SX1233 it is handled locally by the \nListen mode block without using uC resources or energy.\nThe simplified timing diagram of this procedure is illustrated in Figure  21. \nFigure 21.   Listen Mode Sequence (no wanted signal is received)\n4.3.1.  Timings\nThe duration of the Idle phase is given by tListenIdle . The time during which the receiver is on and waits for a signal is given \nby tListenRx . tListenRx includes the wake-up time of the receiver, described in section 4.2.3 . This duration can be \nprogrammed in the configuration registers via the serial interface.  \nBoth time periods tListenRx  and tListenIdle  (denoted tListenX  in the following text) are fixe d by two parameters from the \nconfiguration register and are calculated as follows :\nwhere ListenResolX is the Rx or Idle resolution and is independen tly programmable on three values (64us, 4.1ms or \n262ms), whereas ListenCoefX is an integer between 1 and 255. All parameters are located in RegListen  registers.\nThe timing ranges are tabulated in Table  16 below.\nTable 16 Range of Durations in Listen Mode\nListenResolX Min duration \n( ListenCoef = 1 )Max duration\n( ListenCoef = 255 )\n01 64 us 16 ms\n10 4.1 ms 1.04 s11 0.26 s 67 s \ntime tListenIdle  \ntListenRx  tListenRx  Idle Rx Rx \nsolX ListenX ListenCoef tListenX Re ⋅ =     \nwww.semtech.com Page 41SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech CorporationNotes - the accuracy of the typical timings given in  Table 16 will depend in the RC oscillator calibration\n- RC oscillator calibration is require d, and must be performe d at power up.

Criteria\nThe criteria taken for detecting a wanted signal and henc e deciding to maintain the receiver on is defined by ListenCriteria\nin RegListen1.\nTable 17 Signal Acceptance Criteria in Listen Mode\n4.3.3.

Listen Mode Sequence (wanted signal is received)\nListen mode can be disabled by writing ListenOn  to 0.\n4.3.4.  Stopping Listen Mode\nTo abort Listen mode operation, the following procedure must be respected:\n\uf077Program RegOpMode  with ListenOn =0, ListenAbort =1, and the desired setting for the Mode  bits (Sleep, Stdby, FS, Rx \nor Tx mode) in a single SPI access\n\uf077Program RegOpMode  with ListenOn =0, ListenAbort =0, and the desired setting for the Mode  bits (Sleep, Stdby, FS, Rx \nor Tx mode) in a second SPI access\n4.3.5.  RC Timer Accuracy\nAll timings of the Listen Mo de rely on the accuracy of the in ternal low-power RC oscillator. This oscillator is automatically \ncalibrated at the device power-up, and it is a user-transparent process.\nFor applications enduring large temperature variations, and fo r which the power supply is ne ver removed, RC calibration \ncan be performed upon user request. RcCalStart  in RegOsc1  can be used to trigger this calibration, and the flag \nRcCalDone  will be set automatically when the calibration is over.PayloadReady\nListenCriteria\npassed\nListen ModeIdle Rx\nListen Mode\nListen ModeIdle Rx Mode\nIdle Rx Idle RxListenEnd = 00\nListenEnd = 01\nListenEnd = 10\nwww.semtech.com Page 43SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation4.4.  AutoModes\nAutomatic modes of packet handler can be enabled by configuring the related parameters in RegAutoModes.\nThe intermediate mode of the chip is called IntermediateMode and the enter and exit conditions to/from this intermediate \nmode can be configured through the parameters EnterCondition  & ExitCondition . \nThe enter and exit conditions cannot be used independently of each other i.e. both should be enabled at the same time.  \nThe initial and the final state is the one configured in Mode in RegOpMode . The initial & final states can be different by \nconfiguring the modes register while the chip is in intermediat e mode. The pictorial description of the auto modes is shown \nbelow. \nFigure 23.

Data Processing\n5.1.  Overview\n5.1.1.  Block Diagram\nFigure below illustrates the SX123 3 data processing circuit. Its role is to  interface the data to/from the modulator/\ndemodulator and the uC access points (SPI and DIO pins ). It also controls all the configuration registers. \nThe circuit contains several control blocks wh ich are described in the following paragraphs.\n \nFigure 24.   SX1233 Data Processing Conceptual View\nThe SX1233 implements several data operation modes, each with their own data path through the data processing section. \nDepending on the data operation mode selected, some cont rol blocks are active whilst others remain disabled.\n5.1.2.  Data Operation Modes\nThe SX1233 has two different data operation modes selectable by the user:\n\uf077Continuous mode:  each bit transmitted or received is accessed in re al time at the DIO2/DATA pin. This mode may be \nused if adequate external signal processing is available.\n\uf077Packet mode (recommended):  user only provides/retrieves payload bytes to/from the FIFO. The packet is automatically \nbuilt with preamble, Sy nc word, and optional AES, CRC, and DC-free en coding schemes The re verse operation is \nperformed in reception. The uC proces sing overhead is hence significantly re duced compared to Continuous mode. \nDepending on the optional feat ures activated (CRC, AES,  etc) the maximum payload length  is limited to FIFO size, 255 \nbytes or unlimited.\nEach of these data operation modes is described fully in the following sections. \nCONTROL \nSPI PACKET \nHANDLER \n SYNC \nRECOG. \n DIO1 \nMISO MOSI SCK NSS Rx \nTx Tx/Rx \nData \nFIFO \n(+SR) \n \nPotential datapaths (data operation mode dependant) DIO2 DIO0 \nDIO3 \nDIO4 \nDIO5 \nwww.semtech.com Page 45SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation5.2.  Control Block Description\n5.2.1.  SPI Interface\nThe SPI interface gives access to the configuration register via a synchronous full-duplex pr otocol corresponding to CPOL \n= 0 and CPHA = 0 in Motorola/Freescale nome nclature. Only the slave side is implemented.\nThree access modes to the registers are provided:\n\uf077SINGLE access: an address byte followed by a data byte is sent for a write access whereas an address byte is sent and \na read byte is received for the read access. The NSS pin goes  low at the begin of the frame and goes high after the data \nbyte.\n\uf077BURST access: the address byte is followed by several data bytes. The address is automati cally incremented internally \nbetween each data byte. This mode is available for both  read and write accesses. The NSS pin goes low at the \nbeginning of the frame and stay low between each byte . It goes high only afte r the last byte transfer.\n\uf077FIFO access: if the address byte corr esponds to the address of the FIFO, then succeeding  data byte will address the \nFIFO. The address is not automatically incremented but is me morized and does not need to be sent between each data \nbyte. The NSS pin goes low at the beginning of the frame and stay low between each byte. It goes high only after the \nlast byte transfer.\nFigure below shows a typical SPI single access to a register.\nFigure 25.   SPI Timing Diagram (single access)\nMOSI is generated by th e master on the falling edge of SCK and is sample d by the slave (i.e. this SPI interface) on the \nrising edge of SCK. MISO  is generated by the slav e on the falling edge of SCK.\nA transfer always starts by the NSS pin going lo w. MISO is high impedance when NSS is high.\nThe first byte is the address byte. It is made of:\n\uf077wnr bit, which is 1 for write access and 0 for read access\n\uf0777 bits of address, MSB first\nThe second byte is a data byte, either se nt on MOSI by the master in case of a write access, or received by the master on \nMISO in case of read access. The data byte is transmitted MSB first.\nProceeding bytes may be sent on MOSI (for write access) or  received on MISO (for read access) without rising NSS and \nre-sending the address. In FIFO  mode, if the address was the FIFO address then the by tes will be written / read at the \nFIFO address. In Burst mode, if the address was not the FIFO  address, then it is automatic ally incremented at each new \nbyte received.\n\nwww.semtech.com Page 46SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech CorporationThe frame ends when NSS goes high. The next frame must st art with an address byte. The SINGLE access mode is \nactually a special case of FIFO / BURST mode with only 1 data byte transferred.\nDuring the write access, the byte transferred from the slave to the master on the MISO line is the value of the written \nregister before the write operation.\n5.2.2.  FIFO\n5.2.2.1.  Overview and Shift Register (SR)\nIn packet mode of operation, both data to be transmitted and that has been received are stor ed in a configurable FIFO \n(First In First Out) device. It is acce ssed via the SPI interface and provides several interrupts for transfer management.\nThe FIFO is 1 byte wide hence it only performs byte (paralle l) operations, whereas the demodulator functions serially. A \nshift register is therefore employed to interface the two device s. In transmit mode it takes bytes from the FIFO and outputs \nthem serially (MSB first) at the programmed bit rate to the modu lator. Similarly, in Rx the sh ift register gets bit by bit data  \nfrom the demodulator and writes th em byte by byte to the FIFO. Th is is illustrated in figure below.\n \nFigure 26.   FIFO and Shift Register (SR)\nNote When switching to Sleep mode, the FIFO can only be used once the ModeReady flag is  set (quasi immediate from \nall modes except from Tx)\n5.2.2.2.  Size\nThe FIFO size is fixed to 66 bytes.\n5.2.2.3.  Interrupt Sources and Flags\n\uf077FifoNotEmpty : FifoNotEmpty  interrupt source is lo w when byte 0, i.e. wh ole FIFO, is empty. Otherwise it is high. Note \nthat when retrieving data from the FIFO, FifoNotEmpty  is updated on NSS fa lling edge, i.e. when FifoNotEmpty  is \nupdated to low state the currently started read operation must be completed. In other words, FifoNotEmpty  state must \nbe checked after each read operation for a decision on the next one ( FifoNotEmpty  = 1: more byte(s) to read; \nFifoNotEmpty  = 0: no more byte to read).\n\uf077FifoFull : FifoFull  interrupt source is high when the last FIFO byte , i.e. the whole FIFO, is full. Otherwise it is low.\n\uf077FifoOverrunFlag : FifoOverrunFlag  is set when a new byte is written by the user (in Tx or Standby modes) or the SR (in \nRx mode) while the FIFO is already full. Da ta is lost and the flag sh ould be cleared by writing a 1, note that  the FIFO will \nalso be cleared.\n\uf077PacketSent : PacketSent  interrupt source goes high when the SR\'s last bit has been sent. \n\uf077FifoLevel : Threshold can be programmed by FifoThreshold  in RegFifoThresh . Its behavior is illust rated in figure below. \nData Tx/Rx 8 \n1 SR (8bits) byte0byte1FIFO \nMSB LSB \nwww.semtech.com Page 47SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation \nFigure 27.   FifoLevel IRQ Source Behavior\nNote - FifoLevel interrupt is updated only after a read or write operation on the FIFO. Thus the interrupt cannot be \ndynamically updated by only changing the FifoThreshold parameter\n- FifoLevel interrupt is valid  as long as FifoFull does not occur. An empty FIFO will restor e its normal operation\n5.2.2.4.  FIFO Clearing \nTable below summarizes the status of the FI FO when switching between different modes\nTable 19 Status of FIFO when Switching Between Different Modes of the Chip\n5.2.3.  Sync Word Recognition\n5.2.3.1.  Overview\nSync word recognition (als o called Pattern recognition) is activated by setting SyncOn  in RegSyncConfig . The bit \nsynchronizer must also be activated in continuo us mode (automatically done in Packet mode) .\nThe block behaves like a shift register; it continuously comp ares the incoming data with its internally programmed Sync \nword and sets SyncAddressMatch  when a match is detected.  This is illustrated in Figure  28 below.

Sync Word Recognition\nDuring the comparison of the demodulated data, the fi rst bit received is compared with bit 7 (MSB) of RegSyncValue1  and \nthe last bit received is compared with bit 0 (LSB) of the last  byte whose address is determi ned by the length of the Sync \nword.\nWhen the programmed Sync word is detected the user can assume  that this incoming packet is for the node and can be \nprocessed accordingly.\nSyncAddressMatch  is cleared when leaving Rx or FIFO is emptied.\n5.2.3.2.  Configuration\n\uf077Size: Sync word size can be set from 1 to 8 bytes (i.e. 8 to 64 bits) via SyncSize  in RegSyncConfig . In Packet mode this \nfield is also used for Sync word generation in Tx mode.\n\uf077Error tolerance: The number of errors tolerated in the Sync word recognition can be set from 0 to 7 bits to via SyncTol .\n\uf077Value: The Sync word va lue is configured in SyncValue(63:0) . In Packet mode this field is also used for Sync word \ngeneration in Tx mode.\nNote SyncValue choices containing 0x00 bytes are not allowed\n5.2.4.  Packet Handler\nThe packet handler is the block used in Packet mode.  Its functionality is fully described in section 5.5.\n5.2.5.

Continuous Mode\n5.4.1.  General Description\nAs illustrated in Figure  29, in Continuous mode the NRZ data to (from) the (de )modulator is directly accessed by the uC on \nthe bidirectional DIO2/DATA pin. The FIFO  and packet handler are thus inactive.\n \nFigure 29.   Continuous Mode Conceptual View\n5.4.2.  Tx Processing\nIn Tx mode, a synchronous data clock for an external uC is provided on DIO1/DCLK pin. Clock timing with respect to the \ndata is illustrated in Figure  30. DATA is internally sampled on the rising e dge of DCLK so the uC can change logic state \nanytime outside the grayed out setup/hold zone.\n \nFigure 30.   Tx Processing in Continuous Mode\nNote the use of DCLK is required when the modula tion shaping is enabled (see section 3.4.5). \nCONTROL \nSPI SYNC \nRECOG. \n DIO1/DCLK \nMISO MOSI SCK NSS Rx Tx/Rx \nData DIO2/DATADIO0 \nDIO3 \nDIO4 \nDIO5 \n \nDCLK  T_DATA T_DATA  \nDATA  \n(NRZ)  \nwww.semtech.com Page 51SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation5.4.3.  Rx Processing\nIf the bit synchronizer is disabled, the raw demodulator output is made directly available on DATA pin and no DCLK signal \nis provided.\nConversely, if the bit synchronizer is enabled, synchronous cleaned data and clock are made available respectively on \nDIO2/DATA and DIO1/DCLK pins. DATA is sampled on the ri sing edge of DCLK and upd ated on the fa lling edge as \nillustrated below.\n \nFigure 31.   Rx Processing in Continuous Mode\nNote in Continuous mode it is always recommended to enable the bit synchronizer to clean the DATA signal even if the \nDCLK signal is not used by the uC (bit synchron izer is automatically enabled in Packet mode).\n5.5.  Packet Mode \n5.5.1.  General Description\nIn Packet mode the NRZ data to (from) the (de)modulator is no t directly accessed by the uC  but stored in the FIFO and \naccessed via the SPI interface. \nIn addition, the SX1233 packet hand ler performs several pack et oriented tasks such as Preamble and Sync word \ngeneration, CRC calculation/che ck, whitening/dewhitening of data, Mancheste r encoding/decoding, address filtering, AES \nencryption/decryption, etc. This simpli fies software and reduces uC overhead by  performing these repetitive tasks within \nthe RF chip itself.\nAnother important feature is ability to fill and empty the FI FO in Sleep/Stdby mode, ensu ring optimum power consumption \nand adding more flexib ility for the software.

Packet Mode Conceptual View\nNote The Bit Synchronizer is automa tically enabled in Packet mode.\n5.5.2.  Packet Format\n5.5.2.1.  Fixed Length Packet Format\nFixed length packet format is selected when bit PacketFormat is set to 0 and  PayloadLength  is set to any value greater \nthan 0. \nIn applications where the packet length is fixed in advance, this mode of operatio n may be of interest to minimize RF \noverhead (no length byte field is required). All nodes, whet her Tx only, Rx only, or Tx/Rx should be programmed with the \nsame packet length value.\nThe length of th e payload is limited to 255 bytes if AES is not enabled else th e message is limited to  64 bytes (i.e. max 65 \nbytes payload if Address byte is enabled).\nThe length programmed in PayloadLength  relates only to the pa yload which includes the message and the optional \naddress byte. In this mode, the payload must contai n at least one byte, i.e. address or message byte.\nAn illustration of a fixed length packet is shown below. It contains the following fields:\n\uf077Preamble (1010...)\n\uf077Sync word (Network ID)\n\uf077Optional Address byte (Node ID)\n\uf077Message data\n\uf077Optional 2-bytes CRC checksum \nCONTROL \nSPI PACKET \nHANDLER \n SYNC RECOG. \n DIO1\nMISO MOSI SCK NSS Rx \nTx Data \nFIFO \n(+SR) \n DIO2 DIO0 \nDIO3 \nDIO4 \nDIO5 \nwww.semtech.com Page 53SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech CorporationFigure 33.   Fixed Length Packet Format\n5.5.2.2.  Variable Length Packet Format\nVariable length packet format is selected when bit PacketFormat  is set to 1.\nThis mode is useful in applications where the length of the pack et is not known in advance and can vary over time. It is then \nnecessary for the transmitter to send the length information together with each packet in order for the receiver to operate properly.\nIn this mode the length of the payload, indicated by the length  byte, is given by the first byte  of the FIFO and is limited to \n255 bytes if AES is not enabled else the message is limited to 64 bytes (i.e. max 66 bytes payload if Address byte is \nenabled). Note that the length by te itself is not included in its calculation. In this mode, the payload must contain at least 2 \nbytes, i.e. length + address or message byte.\nAn illustration of a variable length packet is  shown below. It contains the following fields:\n\uf077Preamble (1010...)\n\uf077Sync word (Network ID)\n\uf077Length byte \n\uf077Optional Address byte (Node ID)\n\uf077Message data\n\uf077Optional 2-bytes CRC checksum\nFigure 34.

Unlimited Length Packet Format\nUnlimited length packet format is selected when bit PacketFormat  is set to 0 and PayloadLength  is set to 0.\nThe user can then transmit and receive packet of arbitrary length and PayloadLength  register is not used in Tx/Rx modes \nfor counting the length of the bytes transmitted/received. Th is mode is a replacement for the legacy buffered mode in \nSX1211/SX1212 transceivers.\nIn Tx the data is transmitted depending on the TxStartCondition  bit. On the Rx side the data processing features like \nAddress filtering, Manchester encoding and data whitening are not available if the sync pattern length is set to zero \n(SyncOn = 0 ). The filling of the FIFO in this case can be controlled by the bit FifoFillCondition . The CRC detection in Rx is \nalso not supported in this mode of the packet handler, howeve r CRC generation in Tx is ope rational. The interrupts like \nCrcOk  & PayloadReady are not available either.    \nAn unlimited length packet shown in Figure  35 is made up of the following fields: \n\uf077Preamble (1010...).\n\uf077Sync word (Network ID).\n\uf077Optional Address byte (Node ID).\n\uf077Message data\n\uf077Optional 2-bytes CRC checksum (Tx only)\nFigure 35.

If transmission condition is not fulfilled then the packet handler transmits a \npreamble sequence until the condit ion is met. This happens only if the preamble length /= 0, otherwise it transmits a zero or \none until the condition is me t to transmit the packet data.\nThe transmission condition itself is defined as: \n\uf077if TxStartCondition  = 1, the packet handler waits until the first byte is  written into the FIFO, t hen it starts sending the \npreamble followed by the sync word and user payload\n\uf077If TxStartCondition  = 0, the packet handler waits until the number of bytes written in the FIFO is equal to the number \ndefined in RegFifoThresh  + 1\n\uf077If the condition for transmission was alre ady fulfilled i.e. the FIFO was filled in Sleep/Stdby th en the transmission of \npacket starts immediately on enabling Tx\n5.5.4.  Rx Processing (without AES)\nIn Rx mode the packet handler extracts the user payl oad to the FIFO by performing the following operations:\n\uf077Receiving the preamble and stripping it off\n\uf077Detecting the Sync word  and stripping it off\n\uf077Optional DC-free decoding of data\n\uf077Optionally checking the address byte\n\uf077Optionally checking CRC and reflecting the result on CrcOk.  \nOnly the payload (including optional address and length fields) is made available in the FIFO.\nWhen the Rx mode is enabled the demodulator receives the pr eamble followed by the detecti on of sync word. If fixed \nlength packet format is enabled then the number of bytes received as the payload is given by the PayloadLength\nparameter. \nIn variable length mode the first byte receiv ed after the sync word is interpreted as  the length of the received packet. The \ninternal length counter is initializ ed to this received length. The PayloadLength register is set to a value which is greater \nthan the maximum expected length of the received packet. If th e received length is greater than the maximum length stored \nin PayloadLength register the packet is discarded other wise the complete packet is received. \nIf the address check is enabled then the second byte received in  case of variable length and first byte in case of fixed \nlength is the address byte. If the address matches to the one in the NodeAddress  field, reception of the data continues \notherwise it\'s stopped. The CR C check is performed if CrcOn  = 1 and the result is available in CrcOk  indicating that the \nCRC was successful. An interrupt ( PayloadReady ) is also generated on DIO0 as soon  as the payload is available in the \nFIFO. The payload available in the FIFO can also be read in Sleep/Standby mode. \nIf the CRC fails the PayloadReady  interrupt is not generated and the FIFO is cleared. This function can be overridden by \nsetting CrcAutoClearOff  = 1, forcing the availability of PayloadReady  interrupt and the payload in  the FIFO even if the CRC \nfails. \n5.5.5.  AES\nAES is the symmetric-key block cipher that  provides the cryptographi c capabilities to the transce iver. The syst em proposed \ncan work with 128-bit long fixed keys. The fixed key is stored  in a 16-byte write only user configuration register, which \nretains its value in Sleep mode.\nwww.semtech.com Page 56SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech CorporationAs shown in Figure  33 and Figure  34 above the message part of the Packet can be encrypted and decrypted with the \ncipher 128- cipher key stored in the configuration registers. \n5.5.5.1.  Tx Processing\n1. User enters the data to be transmitted in FIFO in Stdby/Sleep mode and gives the transmit command.\n2. On Tx command the Packet handler state machine takes over the control and If encryption is enabled then the \nmessage inside the FIFO is read in blocks of 16 bytes (p added with 0s if needed), encrypted and stored back to FIFO. \nAll this processing is done in Tx mode before enabling the packet handling state machine. Only the Message part of the \npacket is encrypted and preamble, sync word, length byte, address byte and CRC are not encrypted. \n3. Once the encryption is done the Packet handli ng state machine is enabled to transmit the data.\n5.5.5.2.  Rx Processing\n1. The data received is stored in the FIFO, The address , CRC interrupts are generated as usual because these \nparameters were not encrypted.\n2. Once the complete packet has been received. The data is  read from the FIFO, decrypt ed and written back to FIFO. \nThe PayloadReady  interrupt is issued once the decrypted data is re ady in the FIFO for reading via the SPI interface.\nThe AES encryption/decrypt ion cannot be used  on the fly i.e. while transmitting an d receiving data. Thus when AES \nencryption/decryption is enabled, the FIFO acts as a simple buf fer. This buffer is filled befo re initiating any transmission. \nThe data in the buffer is then encrypted before the transmissi on can begin. On the receive side the decryption is initiated \nonly once the complete packet has been received in the buffer.\nThe encryption/decryption process takes appr oximately 7.0 us per 16-byte block. Thus for a maximum of 4 blocks (i.e. 64 \nbytes) it can take up to 28 us for completing the cryptographic operations. \nThe receive side sees the AES decryption time as a sequ ential delay before the PayloadReady  interrupt is available. \nThe Tx side sees the AES encryption time as  a sequential delay in the startup of the Tx chain, thus the startup time of the \nTx will increase a ccording to the length of data. \nIn Fixed length mode the Message part of the payload that can be encrypted/decrypted can be 64 bytes long. If the \naddress filtering is enabled, the length of the pa yload should be at max 65 bytes in this case. \nIn Variable length mode the Max message size that can be en crypted/decrypted is also 64 bytes when address filtering is \ndisabled, else it is 48 bytes. Thus, including length byte, the length of the payload is max 65 or 50 bytes (the latter when \naddress filtering is enabled).\nIf the address filtering is expected then AddressFiltering  must be enabled on the transmitter side as well to prevent address \nbyte to be encrypted.\nCrc check being performed on encrypted data, CrcOk  interrupt will occur "dec ryption time" before PayloadReady  interrupt.\nwww.semtech.com Page 57SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation5.5.6.  Handling Large Packets\nWhen Payload length exceeds FIFO size (66 bytes) whether in fixe d, variable or unlimited length packet format, in addition \nto PacketSent  in Tx and PayloadReady  or CrcOk  in Rx, the FIFO interrupts/flags can be used as described below: \n\uf077For Tx:\nFIFO can be prefilled in Slee p/Standby but must be refille d "on-the-fly" during Tx wit h the rest of the payload.\n1) Prefill FIFO (in Sleep/Standby firs t or directly in  Tx mode) until FifoThreshold  or FifoFull  is set\n2) In Tx, wait for FifoThreshold  or FifoNotEmpty  to be cleared (i.e. FIFO is nearly empty)\n3) Write bytes into the FIFO until FifoThreshold  or FifoFull  is set.\n4) Continue to step 2 until the entire message has been written to the FIFO ( PacketSent  will fire when the last bit of the \npacket has been sent).\n\uf077For Rx:\nFIFO must be unfilled "on-the-fly" during Rx to prev ent FIFO overrun.\n1) Start reading bytes from the FIFO when FifoNotEmpty  or FifoThreshold  becomes set.\n2) Suspend reading from the FIFO if FifoNotEmpty  clears before all bytes of the message have been read\n3) Continue to step 1 until PayloadReady  \n4) Read all remaining bytes from the FIFO either in Rx or Sleep/Standby mode\nNote AES encryption is not feasib le on large packets, since all Payload bytes need to be in the FIFO at the same time to \nperform encryption\n5.5.7.  Packet Filtering \nSX1233\'s packet handler offers several mechanisms for packe t filtering, ensuring that only useful packets are made \navailable to the uC, reducing significantly system power consumption and software complexity.\n5.5.7.1.  Sync Word Based\nSync word filtering/recognition  is used for identifying the start of the pa yload and also for network identification. As \npreviously described, the Sync word recognition block is configured (size, error tolerance, value) in RegSyncValue\nregisters. This information is used, both for appendi ng Sync word in Tx, and filtering packets in Rx.\nEvery received packet which does not st art with this locally config ured Sync word is automat ically discarded and no \ninterrupt is generated. \nWhen the Sync word is detected, payloa d reception automatically starts and SyncAddressMatch  is asserted.\nNote Sync Word values containing 0x00 byte(s) are forbidden\n \nwww.semtech.com Page 58SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation5.5.7.2.  Address Based\nAddress filtering can be enabled via the AddressFiltering  bits. It adds another level of filt ering, above Sync word (i.e. Sync \nmust match first), typically useful in a multi-node networks where a network ID is shared between all nodes (Sync word) \nand each node has its own ID (address).\nTwo address based filtering options are available:\n\uf077AddressFiltering = 01 : Received address field is compared with internal register NodeAddress . If they match then the \npacket is accepted and processed, otherwise it is discarded.\n\uf077AddressFiltering = 10 : Received address field is compared with internal registers NodeAddress  and BroadcastAddress . \nIf either is a match, the received packet is accepted and proc essed, otherwise it is discar ded. This additional check with \na constant is useful for implementing  broadcast in a multi-node networks\nPlease note that the received address byte, as part of the pa yload, is not stripped off the packet and is made available in \nthe FIFO. In addition, NodeAddress  and AddressFiltering  only apply to Rx. On Tx side, if  address filtering is expected, the \naddress byte should simply be put into the FIFO like any other byte of the payload. \nAs address filtering requires a Sync word match,  both features share th e same interrupt flag SyncAddressMatch .\n5.5.7.3.  Length Based\nIn variable length Packet mode, PayloadLength  must be programmed with the maxi mum payload length permitted. If \nreceived length byte is smaller than this maximum then th e packet is accepted and processed, otherwise it is discarded.\nPlease note that the received le ngth byte, as part of the payload, is not stri pped off the packet and is made available in the \nFIFO.\nTo disable this function the user should set the value of the PayloadLength  to 255.\n5.5.7.4.  CRC Based\nThe CRC check is enabled by setting bit CrcOn  in RegPacketConfig1 . It is used for checking the integrity of the message.\n\uf077On Tx side a two byte CRC checksum is calculated on th e payload part of the packet and appended to the end of the \nmessage\n\uf077On Rx side the checksum is calculated on the received pa yload and compared with the two checksum bytes received. \nThe result of the comparison is stored in bit CrcOk.\nBy default, if the CRC check fails then the FIFO is automatically cleared and no inte rrupt is generated. This filtering functio n \ncan be disabled via CrcAutoClearOff  bit and in this case, even if CRC fa ils, the FIFO is not cleared and only PayloadReady\ninterrupt goes high. Please note that in  both cases, the two CRC checksum bytes ar e stripped off by the packet handler \nand only the payload is made available in the FIFO.\nThe CRC is based on the CCITT polynomial as shown below. This implementation also detects errors due to leading and trailing zeros.\nwww.semtech.com Page 59SX1233\nWIRELESS & SENSING DATASHEET\nRev. 7 - July 2013\n©2013 Semtech Corporation \nFigure 36.   CRC Implementation\n5.5.8.  DC-Free Data Mechanisms\nThe payload to be transmitted may contain long sequences of  1\'s and 0\'s, which introduces a DC bias in the transmitted \nsignal. The radio signal thus produced has a non uniform power distribution over the occupied channel bandwidth. It also \nintroduces data dependencies in the normal operation of the demodu lator. Thus it is useful if the transmitted data is random \nand DC free.\nFor such purposes, two techniques are made available in th e packet handler: Manchester encoding and data whitening.\nNote Only one of the two methods should be enabled at a time.\n5.5.8.1.  Manc hester Encoding\nManchester encoding/decoding is enabled if DcFree = 01  and can only be used in Packet mode. \nThe NRZ data is converted to Manchester code  by coding \'1\' as "10" and \'0\' as "01". \nIn this case, the maximum chip rate is th e maximum bit rate given in the specificatio ns section and the actual bit rate is half  \nthe chip rate. \nManchester encoding and decoding is only applied to the payload and CRC checksum while preamble and Sync word are kept NRZ. However, the chip rate from preamble to CRC is the same and defined by BitRate  in RegBitRate  (Chip Rate = \nBit Rate NRZ = 2 x Bit Rate Manchester).\nManchester encoding/dec oding is thus made transparent for the user, who still provides/retrieves NRZ data to/from the \nFIFO.\n \nFigure 37.

Data Whitening\nAnother technique called whitening or scrambling is widely us ed for randomizing the user data before radio transmission. \nThe data is whitened using a random sequence on the Tx side and de-whitened on the Rx side using the same sequence. \nComparing to Manchester technique it has the advantage of ke eping NRZ data rate i.e. actual bit rate is not halved.\nThe whitening/de-whitening process is enabled if DcFree = 10 . A 9-bit LFSR is used to generate a random sequence. The \npayload and 2-byte CRC checksum is then XORed with this random sequence as shown belo w. The data is de-whitened \non the receiver side by XORing with the same random sequence. \nPayload whitening/de-white ning is thus made transparent for the user, who still provides/r etrieves NRZ data to/from the \nFIFO.\n \nFigure 38.
