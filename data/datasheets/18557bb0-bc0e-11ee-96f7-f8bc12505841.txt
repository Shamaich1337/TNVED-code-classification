Then  the 5 V power \nsupply provid es the 3.3 V power to the microcontroller  and peripherals via 3.3 V voltage regulator \n(U2) on board.  \nThe 5 V pin of J4 or J7 can also be used as an input power source. Then t he AT -START -F407 \nboard must  be powered by a 5 V power supply unit.  \nThe 3.3 V pin of J4, or the VDD pin of J1 and J2 , can also be directly used as 3.3 V input power \nsupply. Then the AT-START -F407 board must be powered by a 3.3 V power supply unit.  \nNote:  Unless 5 V is provided throug h the USB connector (CN6) on the AT -Link-EZ, the AT -Link-EZ will  \nnot be powered by other power supply methods.  \nWhen another application board is connected to J4, the VIN , 5 V and 3.3 V pins can be used as \noutput power; the 5V pin of J7 as 5 V output power  supply ; the VDD  pin of J1 and J2 as 3.3 V \noutput power  supply . \n3.2 IDD \nWhen  JP3 OFF  (symbol IDD) and R13 OFF , an ammeter can be connected  to measure the power \nconsumption of AT32F407VGT7 . \n\uf06c JP3 OFF , R13 ON  \nAT32F407VGT7  is powered.

AT-Link-EZ supports SWD interface mode and  SWO debugg ing. It \noffers  a virtual COM  port (VCP)  to be connect ed to the USART1 _TX/USART1_RX (PA9/PA10)  of \nAT32F407VGT7 .  \nPlease refer to AT-Link User M anual  for complete details on AT-Link-EZ. \nThe AT-Link-EZ PCB on the evaluation board can be separate d from AT -START -F407  by bending \nit along the joint . In this case, AT -START -F407 can still be connected to the CN7 of AT-Link-EZ \nthrough CN2 (not mounted before shipping ), or can be connected with  another AT -Link to continue \nprogramming and debugging on the AT32F407VGT7 . \n \n3.3.2  20-pin ARM® standard JTAG connector  \nAT-START -F407 also reserves JTAG  or SWD general -purpose connectors as \nprogra mming/debugging tools. If the user want s to use this interface to program and debug the \nAT32F407VGT7 , please separate  the AT-Link-EZ from this board or configure R41, R44  and R46 \nOFF, and then connect  CN3 (not mounted before shipping ) to the  programming and debugging \ntool. \nArtery microcontrollers are compatible with most of the third -party development tools in the market. \nHowever, it is still recommended to use AT -Link related tools for better debugging experience.  \n \nAT-START -F407  User M anual  \n2023.9.11 11 Rev 1.30 \n3.4 Boot mode selection  \nAt startup, the board boots from the following memory locations, depending on BOOT1 and  \nBOOT0 . \nTable 1.

The VBUS can  be used as 5 V power supply of AT -START -F407 board.  \n \n3.9 Connec ting Flash memory Bank 3 via SPIM interface  \nThe SPI Flash EN25QH128A  on board , which  is connected to the AT32F407VGT7  via SPIM \ninterface , is used as extended  Flash memory  bank 3 .  \nWhen using Bank 3, the JP8  must be connected to SPIM on the left side,  as shown in Table 2. The \nPB1, PA8, PB10 , PB11, PB6 and PB7 are not connected to the external LQFP100  I/O extension \nconnector s. These 6 pins are marked  by adding [*] after  the pin name of extension connector s on \nthe PCB silkscreen.  \nTable 2.

The PA8, PB10 and PB11 are connected to the external LQFP100 I/O  \nextension connectors . \nBy default,  Ethernet PHY is connected to the AT32F407VGT7  in RMII  mode. In this ca se, the 25 \nMHz clock required for  PHY is provided by Y4 crystal, by default. In addition, it is possible to solder \n49.9Ω and 100 k Ω onto R39 and R64 respectively, and then desolder Y4, C6 and C7. In such \ncase, it is the CLKOUT (PA8) pin of AT32F407VGT7  that provides 25 MHz clock  to the XT1  pin of \nPHY. For RM II_REF_CLK (PA1) of the AT32F407VGT7, its 50 MHz clock source is provided by the \n50MCLK pin of PHY. Note that t he 50MCLK pin must be pulled up at power -on. \nBesides, Ethernet PHY and AT32F407VGT7  can be connected in MII mode. To do so,  users need \nto modify resistors  according to the footnotes that are shown in Schematics  on page 5 . In this case , \nthe TXCLK  and RXCLK of PHY are connected to the MII_TX_CLK (PC3) and MII_RX_CLK (PA1) \nof AT32F407VGT7, respectively.  \nNote that AT32F407VGT7  is connected to the PHY with the  pin of remapping 1 configuration . \nTo simplify PCB design, the PHY does not have an external Flash memory to allocate the PHY \naddress [3:0] at power -on. T he PHY address [3:0] is set to 0x0 by default. After power -on, it is \npossible to re -configure PHY addresses through the  SMI connector of PHY.  \nFor complete information on Ethernet MAC and DM9162  of the AT32F407VGT7 , please refer to \ntheir respective technical manual and data sheet.  \nIf the LQFP100 I/O  extension connectors  J1 and J2 , rather than DM9162,  are used to connect to \nother Ethernet application boards, please refer to Table 3  to disconnect AT32F407VGT7  from \nDM9162 . \nWhile evaluating other functions of the AT32F407VGT7  without using Ethernet, it is recommended \nto put DM9162 in reset state by enabling PC8 output low.  \n  \nAT-START -F407  User M anual  \n2023.9.11 14 Rev 1.30 \n3.11 0 Ω resistor s \nTable 3. 0 Ω resistor setting s \nResistor s State(1) Description  \nR13 \n(Microcontroller power \nconsumption \nmeasurement)  ON When JP3 OFF, the microcontroller is directly powered by \n3.3 V  \nOFF When JP3 OFF, an ammeter can be connected to 3.3 V to \nmeasure power consumption of the microcontroller  \n(if no ammeter, the microcontroller cannot be powered)  \nR4 \n(VBAT power supply ) ON VBAT is connected to  VDD  \nOFF VBAT can be powered by the pin _6 VBAT of J2  \nR5, R6, R7, R8  \n(LEXT ) OFF, ON, ON, OFF  The crystal Y1  on board is used as LEXT clock source  \nON, OFF, OFF, ON  LEXT  clock source is fro m external PC14, or PC14 and \nPC15 are used as GPIOs.  \nR17 \n(VREF+) ON VREF+ is connected to  VDD  \nOFF VREF+ is connected to the J2 pin_21 or to the AREF of the \nArduinoTM  connector J3  \nR19, R21  \n(User button  B2) ON, OFF  User button B2 is connected to PA0 \nOFF, ON  User button B2 is connected to PC13  \nR29, R30  \n(PA11, PA12)  OFF, OFF  When PA11 and PA12  used as USB, they are not \nconnected to pin-20 and pin_ 21 of J1  \nON, ON  When PA11 and PA12 are not used as USB, they are \nconnected to  pin_20 and pin_ 21 of J1  \nR62~R63，R66~R86  \n(Ethernet  PHY DM9162  \nsignals)  See the foot notes  of \nSchematics on page 5   Ethernet MAC of AT32F407VGT  is connected to DM9162  \nthrough RMII  mode (R66 and R70 are 4.7 kΩ ) \nSee the foot notes  of \nSchematics on page 5  Ethernet MAC of AT32F407VGT  is connected to DM9162  \nthrough MII mode  \nAll OFF except R66 and \nR70 Ethernet MAC of AT32F407VGT7  is disconnected from \nDM9162  (in this case, AT -START -F403A board is a better \nchoice)  \nR39, R64 \n(Ethernet  PHY DM9162  \nclock input)  OFF, OFF Y4 crystal is used as DM9162  clock source  \nON, ON The CLKOUT (PA8) of the AT32F40 7VGT7  is used as \nDM9162  clock source  \nR31, R32, R33, R34  \n(ArduinoTM A4, A5)  OFF, ON, OFF, ON  ArduinoTM A4 and A5 are connected to ADC_IN11 and  \nADC_IN10  \nON, OFF, ON, OFF  ArduinoTM A4 and A5 are connected to I2C1_SDA and \nI2C1_SCL  \nR35, R36  \n(ArduinoTM D10)  OFF, ON  ArduinoTM D10 is connected to SPI1_SS  \nON, OFF  ArduinoTM D10 is connected to  PWM (TMR4_CH1)  \n(1)  The factory default Rx state is shown in BOLD  font. \nAT-START -F407  User M anual  \n2023.9.11 15 Rev 1.30 \n3.12 Extension connectors  \n3.12.1  ArduinoTM Uno R3  extension connector s  \nFemale plug J3~J6  and male J7 support standard ArduinoTM Uno R3  connector .
