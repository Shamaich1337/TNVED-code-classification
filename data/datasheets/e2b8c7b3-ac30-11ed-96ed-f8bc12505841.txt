The ri pple current verify method according to JIS ‐C‐5101‐1(2010) No.: 4.23. \n☆ Note:  1. Ripple current requires frequency correction \n2. Check the heat generation of capacitor if ri pple current on the circuit is hard to measure. \n     Self heating should be within 5°C.  \n2. Working Voltage (WV) \nMake sure that no excess voltage (that is, higher than the ra ted voltage) is applied to capacitor. Please pay attention so \nthat the peak voltage, which is DC voltage, overlappe d by ripple current, will not exceed the rated voltage. \n3. Insulating \nGeneral types of aluminum electrolytic capacitors are covere d with a vinyl sleeve or the like. And this Sleeve is used for \nmarking. When the internal element or  the container is needed to be insula ted, capacitors specially designed for \ninsulation requirement are recommended to be used.  \n4. Soldering \n4.1 When soldering a printed circuit board with various co mponents, too high soldering temperature or too long \ndipping times may cause secondary shrinking of the sleev e which unnecessarily expose s the Container. Soldering \nis allowed to reform at less than 260°C for less than 10 seconds.  \n4.2 Soldering may melt or break the sleeve, if the sleeve is contacted with circuit patterns. To avoid this, the \ncapacitors are recommended to be slight ly apart from the circuit boards. \n5. Vent \nThe capacitors( Ф≥10mm) are provided with a pressure resistive cont rolled safety vent formed on the bottom of the \nContainer. The vent is designed to rupture in the event that circuit develops higher internal pressure Multi ‐function or \ncapacitor misuse. \n6.
