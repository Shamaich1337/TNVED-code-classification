They provide excellent circuit \nreliability and low cost by eliminating external components and adjustments when used with +5V, +3.3V, +3.0V, or +2.5V powered circuits.\nThese circuits perform a single function: they assert a \nreset signal whenever the V\nCC supply voltage declines \nbelow a preset threshold, keeping it asserted for at least \n140ms after V CC has risen above the reset threshold. \nReset thresholds suitable for operation with a variety of supply voltages are available.\nThe MAX803 has an open-drain output stage, while the \nMAX809/MAX810 have push-pull outputs. The MAX803’s open-drain RESET output requires a pullup resistor that \ncan be connected to a voltage higher than V\nCC. The \nMAX803/MAX809 have an active-low RESET output, \nwhile the MAX810 has an active-high RESET output. The \nreset comparator is designed to ignore fast transients on V\nCC, and the outputs are guaranteed to be in the correct \nlogic state for V CC down to 1V.\nLow supply current makes the MAX803/MAX809/MAX810 ideal for use in portable equipment.

The MAX803/MAX809/MAX810 assert reset \nto prevent code-execution errors during power-up, power-\ndown, or brownout conditions. They assert a reset signal whenever the V\nCC supply voltage declines below a preset \nthreshold, keeping it asserted for at least 140ms after V CC \nhas risen above the reset threshold. The MAX803 uses \nan open-drain output, and the MAX809/MAX810 have a \npush-pull output stage. Connect a pullup resistor on the MAX803’s RESET output to any supply between 0 and 6V.\nApplications Information\nNegative-Going V CC Transients\nIn addition to issuing a reset to the μP during power-up, \npower-down, and brownout conditions, the MAX803/\nMAX809/MAX810 are relatively immune to short-duration \nnegative-going V CC transients (glitches).\nFigure 1 shows typical transient duration vs. reset  \ncomparator overdrive, for which the MAX803/MAX809/\nMAX810 do not generate a reset pulse. The graph \nwas generated using a negative-going pulse applied to V CC, starting 0.5V above the actual reset threshold \nand ending below it by the magnitude indicated (reset  \ncomparator overdrive). The graph indicates the maximum \npulse width a negative-going V CC transient can have with-\nout causing a reset pulse. As the magnitude of the transient \nincreases (goes farther below the reset threshold), the \nmaximum allowable pulse width decreases. Typically, for \nthe MAX8__L and MAX8__M, a V CC transient that goes \n100mV below the reset threshold and lasts 20μs or less will not cause a reset pulse. A 0.1μF bypass capacitor mounted \nas close as possible to the V\nCC pin provides additional \ntransient immunity.\nEnsuring a Valid Reset Output Down to  \nVCC = 0V\nWhen V CC falls below 1V, the MAX809 RESET output no \nlonger sinks current—it becomes an open circuit.\nTherefore, high-impedance CMOS logic inputs connect-\ned to RESET can drift to undetermined voltages. This  \npresents no problem in most applications since most μP and other circuitry is inoperative with V\nCC below 1V. \nHowever, in applications where RESET must be valid \ndown to 0V, adding a pull-down resistor to RESET causes \nany stray leakage currents to flow to ground, holding RESET low (Figure 2). R1’s value is not critical; 100kΩ is \nlarge enough not to load RESET and small enough to pull \nRESET to ground.\nA 100kΩ pullup resistor to V CC is also recommended for the \nMAX810 if RESET is required to remain valid for V CC < 1V.\nInterfacing to μPs with Bidirectional Reset \nPins\nSince the RESET output on the MAX803 is open \ndrain, this device interfaces easily with μPs that have  \nbidirectional reset pins, such as the Motorola 68HC11. \nConnecting the μP supervisor’s RESET output directly to \nthe μC’s RESET pin with a single pullup resistor allows \neither device to assert reset (Figure 3).\nMAX803 Open-Drain RESET Output Allows  \nUse with Multiple Supplies\nGenerally, the pullup connected to the MAX803 will  \nconnect to the supply voltage that is being monitored at the IC’s V\nCC pin. However, some systems may use the open-\ndrain output to level-shift from the monitored supply to reset  \ncircuitry powered by some other supply (Figure 4). Note that as the MAX803’s V\nCC decreases below 1V, so does \nthe IC’s ability to sink current at RESET. Also, with any \npullup, RESET will be pulled high as V CC decays toward \n0. The voltage where this occurs depends on the pullup \nresistor value and the voltage to which it is connected.PIN NAME FUNCTION\n1 GND Ground\n2RESET  \n(MAX803/ \nMAX809)RESET Output remains low while V CC \nis below the reset threshold, and for at  \nleast 140ms after V CC rises above the \nreset threshold.\nRESET  \n(MAX810)RESET Output remains high while V CC \nis below the reset threshold, and for at least 140ms after V\nCC rises above the \nreset threshold.\n3 VCCSupply Voltage (+5V, +3.3V, +3.0V, or +2.5V)TOP VIEW\nRESET (RESET)1 GND\nVCCMAX803\nMAX809MAX810\nSC70-3/SOT23-323\n( ) ARE FOR MAX810.\nMAX803 AVAILABLE IN SC70-3 ONLY.\nMAX803/MAX809/\nMAX8103-Pin Microprocessor Reset Circuits\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 5Pin DescriptionPin Configuration\nBenefits of Highly Accurate Reset Threshold\nMost μP supervisor ICs have reset-threshold voltages \nbetween 5% and 10% below the value of nominal supply \nvoltages. This ensures a reset will not occur within 5% of \nthe nominal supply, but will  occur when the supply is 10% \nbelow nominal.When using ICs rated at only the nominal supply ±5%, this leaves a zone of uncertainty where the supply is \nbetween 5% and 10% low, and where the reset may or may not be asserted.\nThe MAX8_ _L/T/Z use highly accurate circuitry to ensure \nthat reset is asserted close to the 5% limit, and long \nbefore the supply has declined to 10% below nominal.\nFigure 1.

Its primary function is to assert a reset signal whenever the supply voltage (VCC) drops below a preset threshold, ensuring that the system operates reliably during power-up, power-down, or brownout conditions. The MAX809 features a push-pull output, which allows for direct interfacing with other digital logic without the need for external pull-up resistors.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Computers:** Ensures proper reset during power fluctuations.
- **Controllers:** Maintains system stability by monitoring supply voltage.
- **Intelligent Instruments:** Provides reliable operation in critical applications.
- **Portable/Battery-Powered Equipment:** Low supply current makes it ideal for battery-operated devices.
- **Automotive:** AEC-Q100 qualification makes it suitable for automotive applications where reliability is crucial.

The MAX809REUR+T is particularly beneficial in applications where precise voltage monitoring is required, and it simplifies design by eliminating the need for external components, making it a cost-effective solution for power management in various electronic systems.
