The device package \nallows for easy implementation by the customer. Typical \napplications include circuit protection, current monitoring, \nand motor and inverter control.\nThe device consists of a linear Hall sensor circuit with a copper \nconduction path located near the surface of the die. Applied \ncurrent flowing through this copper conduction path generates \na magnetic field which is sensed by the integrated Hall IC \nand converted into a proportional voltage. Device accuracy is \noptimized through the close proximity of the magnetic signal \nto the Hall transducer.\nThe output of the device has a positive slope proportional to \nthe current flow from IP+ to IP–  (pins 1 and 2, to pins 3 and \n4).  The internal resistance of this conductive path is 0.6 mΩ \nfor the EX package, and 1.2 mΩ for the LC package, providing \na non-intrusive measurement interface that saves power in \napplications that require energy efficiency.\nThe ACS711 is optimized for low-side current sensing \napplications, although the terminals of the conductive path \nare electrically isolated from the sensor IC leads, providing \nsufficient internal creepage and clearance dimensions for a \nlow AC or DC working voltage applications. The thickness \nof the copper conductor allows survival of the device at up to \n5× overcurrent conditions.\nThe ACS711 is provided in small, surface-mount packages: \nSOIC8 and QFN12. The leadframe is plated with 100% matte tin, \nwhich is compatible with standard lead (Pb) free printed circuit \nboard assembly processes. Internally, the device is Pb-free, \nexcept for flip-chip high-temperature Pb-based solder balls, \ncurrently exempt from RoHS. The device is fully calibrated \nprior to shipment from the factory.\nIP+\nIP+\nIP–\nIP–IP\nGNDACS71 1+3.3 V\nVIOU TVCC CBYP\n0.1 μF\nCLOAD\nRPU\nFAULTACS711\nACS711A-DS, Rev. 6\nMCO-0000224Hall-Effect Linear Current Sensor with  \nOvercurrent Fault Output for <100 V Isolation Applications\nNot to scalePACKAGES:\nTypical Application  \n8-pin SOICN\nwith internally fused path\n(LC package)\nApplication 1.
