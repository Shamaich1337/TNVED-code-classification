The device\ncansupply 2.5Atoloads with anoutput voltage as\nlowas0.8V.Dual N-channel synchronous MOSFET\nswitches allow alowcomponent count, thus reducing\ncomplexity andminimizing board size.\nDifferent from most other COT regulators, the\nLM3102 does notrely onoutput capacitor ESR for\nstability, and isdesigned towork exceptionally well\nwith ceramic and other very low-ESR output\ncapacitors. The device requires no loop\ncompensation, results inafast load transient\nresponse and simple circuit implementation. The\noperating frequency remains nearly constant with line\nvariations duetotheinverse relationship between the\ninput voltage and the ON-time. The operating\nfrequency can beexternally programmed upto\n1MHz. Protection features include VCCundervoltage\nlockout (UVLO), output overvoltage protection,\nthermal shutdown, and gate drive UVLO.

Itcontains Dual N-channel main and\nsynchronous MOSFETs. The Constant ON-Time (COT) regulation scheme requires noloop compensation,\nresults infast load transient response and simple circuit implementation. The regulator can function properly\neven with anallceramic output capacitor network, and does notrely ontheESR oftheoutput capacitor for\nstability. The operating frequency remains constant with linevariations due totheinverse relationship between\ntheinput voltage andtheON-time. The valley current limit detection circuit, with thelimit setinternally at2.7A,\ninhibits themain MOSFET until theinductor current level subsides.\nThe LM3102 can beapplied innumerous applications and can operate efficiently forinputs ashigh as42V.\nProtection features include output overvoltage protection, thermal shutdown, VCCUVLO, gate drive UVLO. The\nLM3102 isavailable inthethermally enhanced HTSSOP-20 package.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 COT Control Circuit Overview\nCOT control isbased onacomparator andaone-shot ON-timer, with theoutput voltage feedback (feeding tothe\nFBpin)compared with aninternal reference of0.8V.Ifthevoltage oftheFBpinisbelow thereference, themain\nMOSFET isturned onforafixed ON-time determined byaprogramming resistor RONandtheinput voltage VIN,\nupon which theON-time varies inversely. Following theON-time, themain MOSFET remains offforaminimum\nof260 ns.Then, ifthevoltage oftheFBpinisbelow thereference, themain MOSFET isturned onagain for\nanother ON-time period. Theswitching willcontinue toachieve regulation.\nVOUT\n1.3 x 10-10 x RONfSW = \n(VIN ± VOUT) x RON2VOUT (VIN - 1) x L x 1.18 x 1020 x IOUTfSW = \n12LM3102\nSNVS515I –SEPTEMBER 2007 –REVISED JANUARY 2018 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: LM3102Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2007 –2018, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFeature Description (continued)\nThe regulator willoperate inthediscontinuous conduction mode (DCM) atalight load, and thecontinuous\nconduction mode (CCM) with aheavy load. IntheDCM, thecurrent through theinductor starts atzero and\nramps uptoapeak during theON-time, andthen ramps back tozero before theendoftheOFF-time. Itremains\nzero and theload current issupplied entirely bytheoutput capacitor. The next ON-time period starts when the\nvoltage attheFBpinfalls below theinternal reference. The operating frequency intheDCM islower andvaries\nlarger with theload current ascompared with theCCM. Conversion efficiency ismaintained because conduction\nloss andswitching loss arereduced with thereduction intheload andtheswitching frequency, respectively. The\noperating frequency intheDCM canbecalculated approximately asfollows:\n(1)\nInthecontinuous conduction mode (CCM), thecurrent flows through theinductor intheentire switching cycle,\nandnever reaches zero during theOFF-time. The operating frequency remains relatively constant with load and\nlinevariations. TheCCM operating frequency canbecalculated approximately asfollows:\n(2)\nTheoutput voltage issetbytwoexternal resistors RFB1andRFB2.Theregulated output voltage is\nVOUT=0.8V x(RFB1+RFB2)/RFB2 (3)\n7.3.2 Start-Up Regulator (VCC)\nAstartup regulator isintegrated within theLM3102. The input pinVINcanbeconnected directly toalinevoltage\nupto42V.The VCCoutput regulates at6V,and iscurrent limited to65mA. Upon power up,theregulator\nsources current intoanexternal capacitor CVCC,which isconnected totheVCC pin.Forstability, CVCCmust beat\nleast 680nF.When thevoltage ontheVCC pinishigher than theUVLO threshold of3.75 V,themain MOSFET\nisenabled andtheSSpinisreleased toallow thesoft-start capacitor CSStocharge.\nThe minimum input voltage isdetermined bythedropout voltage oftheregulator and theVCCUVLO falling\nthreshold (≊3.7V).IfVINisless than≊4.0V,theregulator shuts offandVCCgoes tozero.\n7.3.3 Regulation Comparator\nThe feedback voltage attheFBpiniscompared toa0.8-V internal reference. Innormal operation (the output\nvoltage isregulated), anON-time period isinitiated when thevoltage attheFBpinfalls below 0.8V.The main\nMOSFET stays onfortheON-time, causing theoutput voltage andconsequently thevoltage oftheFBpintorise\nabove 0.8V.After theON-time period, themain MOSFET stays offuntil thevoltage oftheFBpinfalls below 0.8\nVagain. Bias current attheFBpinisnominally 5nA.\n7.3.4 Zero Coil Current Detect\nThe current ofthesynchronous MOSFET ismonitored byazero coilcurrent detection circuit which inhibits the\nsynchronous MOSFET when itscurrent reaches zero until thenext ON-time. This circuit enables theDCM\noperation, which improves theefficiency atalight load.\n7.3.5 Overvoltage Comparator\nThe voltage attheFBpiniscompared toa0.92-V internal reference. Ifthevoltage rises above 0.92 V,theON-\ntime isimmediately terminated. This condition isknown asovervoltage protection (OVP). Itcanoccur iftheinput\nvoltage ortheoutput load changes suddenly. Once theOVP isactivated, themain MOSFET remains offuntil the\nvoltage attheFBpinfalls below 0.92 V.The synchronous MOSFET willstay ontodischarge theinductor until\ntheinductor current reduces tozero, andthen switch off.\nILR =(VIN - VOUT) x ton\nL\n13LM3102\nwww.ti.com SNVS515I –SEPTEMBER 2007 –REVISED JANUARY 2018\nProduct Folder Links: LM3102Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2007 –2018, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFeature Description (continued)\n7.3.6 Current Limit\nCurrent limit detection iscarried outduring theOFF-time bymonitoring there-circulating current through the\nsynchronous MOSFET. Referring totheFunctional Block Diagram ,when themain MOSFET isturned off,the\ninductor current flows through theload, thePGND pinand theinternal synchronous MOSFET. Ifthiscurrent\nexceeds 2.7A,thecurrent limit comparator toggles, and asaresult disabling thestart ofthenext ON-time\nperiod. The next switching cycle starts when there-circulating current falls back below 2.7A(and thevoltage at\ntheFBpinisbelow 0.8V). Theinductor current ismonitored during theON-time ofthesynchronous MOSFET. As\nlong astheinductor current exceeds 2.7A,themain MOSFET willremain inhibited toachieve current limit. The\noperating frequency islower during current limit duetoalonger OFF-time.\nFigure 20illustrates aninductor current waveform. Onaverage, theoutput current IOUTisthesame asthe\ninductor current IL,which istheaverage oftherippled inductor current. Incase ofcurrent limit (the current limit\nportion ofFigure 20),thenext ON-time willnotinitiate until that thecurrent drops below 2.7A(assume the\nvoltage attheFBpinislower than 0.8V).During each ON-time thecurrent ramps upanamount equal to:\n(4)\nDuring current limit, theLM3102 operates inaconstant current mode with anaverage output current IOUT(CL)\nequal to2.7A+ILR/2.\nFigure 20.Inductor Current -Current Limit Operation\n7.3.7 N-Channel MOSFET andDriver\nThe LM3102 integrates anN-channel main MOSFET and anassociated floating high voltage main MOSFET\ngate driver. The gate drive circuit works inconjunction with anexternal bootstrap capacitor CBSTandaninternal\nhigh voltage diode. CBSTconnecting between theBST andSWpins powers themain MOSFET gate driver during\nthemain MOSFET ON-time. During each OFF-time, thevoltage oftheSWpinfalls toapproximately –1V,and\nCBSTcharges from VCCthrough theinternal diode. The minimum OFF-time of260 nsprovides enough time for\ncharging CBSTineach cycle.\n7.3.8 Soft-Start\nThe soft-start feature allows theconverter togradually reach asteady-state operating point, thereby reducing\nstartup stresses andcurrent surges. Upon turnon, after VCCreaches theundervoltage threshold, an8-µAinternal\ncurrent source charges upanexternal capacitor CSSconnecting totheSSpin.Theramping voltage attheSSpin\n(and thenon-inverting input oftheregulation comparator aswell) ramps uptheoutput voltage VOUTina\ncontrolled manner.\nVIN1.3 x 10-10 x RONton = \n14LM3102\nSNVS515I –SEPTEMBER 2007 –REVISED JANUARY 2018 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: LM3102Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2007 –2018, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFeature Description (continued)\nAninternal switch grounds theSSpinifanyofthefollowing three cases happens: (i)VCCisbelow theUVLO\nthreshold; (ii)athermal shutdown occurs; or(iii)theENpinisgrounded. Alternatively, theoutput voltage canbe\nshut offbyconnecting theSSpintoground using anexternal switch. Releasing theswitch allows theSSpinto\nramp upandtheoutput voltage toreturn tonormal. Theshutdown configuration isshown inFigure 21.\nFigure 21.Alternate Shutdown Implementation\n7.3.9 Thermal Protection\nThe junction temperature ofthe LM3102 should not exceed the maximum limit. Thermal protection is\nimplemented byaninternal Thermal Shutdown circuit, which activates (typically) at165°Ctomake thecontroller\nenter alowpower reset state bydisabling themain MOSFET, disabling theON-timer, andgrounding theSSpin.\nThermal protection helps prevent catastrophic failures from accidental device overheating. When thejunction\ntemperature falls back below 145°C(typical hysteresis =20°C),theSSpinisreleased and normal operation\nresumes.\n7.3.10 Thermal Derating\nThe LM3102 cansupply 2.5Abelow anambient temperature of100°C.Under worst-case operation, with either\ninput voltage upto42V,operating frequency upto1MHz, orvoltage oftheRON pinbelow theabsolute\nmaximum of7V,theLM3102 candeliver aminimum of1.9-A output current without thermal shutdown with a\nPCB ground plane copper area of40cm2,2oz/Cu.

Iftheinput supply ismore than afew inches from theLM3102, additional bulk capacitance may be\nrequired inaddition totheceramic bypass capacitors. The amount ofbulk capacitance isnotcritical, buta47-μF\nor100-μFelectrolytic capacitor isatypical choice.\n10Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nThe LM3102 regulation, overvoltage, and current limit comparators arevery fast sothey willrespond toshort\nduration noise pulses. Layout istherefore critical foroptimum performance. Itmust beasneat and compact as\npossible, andallexternal components must beasclose totheir associated pins oftheLM3102 aspossible.\nRefer toLayout Example ,theloop formed byCIN,themain and synchronous MOSFET internal totheLM3102,\nandthePGND pinshould beassmall aspossible. The connection from thePGND pintoCINshould beasshort\nanddirect aspossible. Vias should beadded toconnect theground ofCINtoaground plane, located asclose to\nthecapacitor aspossible. The bootstrap capacitor CBSTshould beconnected asclose totheSWandBST pins\naspossible, andtheconnecting traces should bethick. Thefeedback resistors andcapacitor RFB1,RFB2,andCFB\nshould beclose totheFBpin.\nAlong trace running from VOUTtoRFB1isgenerally acceptable because thisisalow-impedance node. Ground\nRFB2directly totheAGND pin(pin7).The output capacitor COUTshould beconnected close totheload andtied\ndirectly totheground plane. The inductor Lshould beconnected close totheSWpinwith asshort atrace as\npossible toreduce thepotential forEMI (electromagnetic interference) generation.\nIfitisexpected that theinternal dissipation oftheLM3102 willproduce excessive junction temperature during\nnormal operation, making good use ofthePCB ground plane can help considerably todissipate heat. The\nexposed pad onthebottom oftheLM3102 ICpackage can besoldered totheground plane, which should\nextend outfrom beneath theLM3102 tohelp dissipate heat.\nThe exposed padisinternally connected totheLM3102 ICsubstrate. Additionally theuseofthick traces, where\npossible, canhelp conduct heat away from theLM3102. Using numerous vias toconnect thedieattached padto\ntheground plane isagood practice. Judicious positioning ofthePCB within theendproduct, along with theuse\nofanyavailable airflow (forced ornatural convection) canhelp reduce thejunction temperature.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 31.Minimize Area ofCurrent Loops inBuck Regulators\nNC\nPGNDNC\nSW\nVIN\nVIN\nBST\nAGND\nSSVCC\nRON\nEN\nFBSW NC\nPGND\nPAD \n(21)1 20\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n8 1319\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14Thermal Vias under DAP\nNC\nNC 109 NC\nGND12\n11CBOOTRONPGNDL\nRFBT\nCFFVOUT sense point \nis away from \ninductor and \npast C OUT   VOUT distribution \npoint is away \nfrom inductor \nand past C OUT  TO LOAD\nRoute V OUT sense trace away from \nSW and VIN nodes.
