The power supply should  be able to provide \nsufficient current up to 100mA .  \nStarting SIM68D  \nFor initial power up, the RTC must start oscillating to sequence the Finite State Machine. RTC start -up time  \nmay vary, when p ower is first applied, SIM68D  goes into operation  mode . \nVerif ication of  SIM68D  Start \nSystem activity indicati on depends upon the chosen serial interface:  \nWhen it is activated, SIM68D  will output messages  at the sele cted UART speed , and message types.  The \ndefault baud rate is 115200bps.  \n \n \n \nthe baud rate information can be found on the label . \nPower Saving  Modes  \nSIM68D  supports power saving  modes for reduc ing average power consumption  like sleep mode, backup \nmode, periodic mode, and AlwayLocateTM mode.  \n \n\uf06c Sleep mode : In this mode the receiver stays at full on power state .

The Timemark signal can be provided through designated output pin for many \nexternal applications.

EASY is efficiently scheduled and compu ted in free time of \nevery second after GPS navigation solution.  \n \nEasy function is conceptually  designed to automatically engage for predicting after first receiving the \nbroadcast ephemeris. After a while （generally tens of seconds ）, 3-day extensions will be completely \ngenerated then all EASY functions will be maintained at a standby condition. EASY assistance is goin g to \nbe engaged when the GPS requests in new TTFF condition or re -generates ag ain with another new \nreceived ephemeris. Meanwhile, TTFF will be benefited by EASY assistance.  \n \n \n \nEASY function is default open and can be closed by PMTK command.  \n NOTE  \n \nNOTE  \n \n \nSIM68D  Hardware Design  V1.02 \nwww.simcom.com                                                                         23 / 35  \n4.8 SBAS and RTCM  \nSBAS is the abbreviation of Satellite Based Augmentation System. The SBAS concept is based on the \ntransmission of differential corrections and integrity messages for navigation satellites that are within sight \nof a network of reference stations deployed across an entire continent. SBAS messages are broadcast via \ngeostationary sa tellites able to cover vast areas.  \n \nSeveral countries have implemented their own satellite -based augmentation system. Europe has the \nEuropean Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) which covers Western Europe and beyond. \nThe USA has its Wide Area  Augmentation System (WAAS). Japan is covered by its Multi -functional \nSatellite Augmentation System (MSAS). India has launched its own SBAS program named GPS and GEO \nAugmented Navigation (GAGAN) to cover the Indian subcontinent.  \n \nSIM68D  module supports SBA S and RTCM , but only one mode can be applied at one time, and SBAS is \nthe default feature, customers who want to apply RTCM in the design can contact SIMCom sales for \nsupporting.  \n4.9 Antenna  \nThe antenna is the most critical item for successful GPS /GLONASS /BEID OU reception in a weak signal \nenvironment. Proper choice and placement of the antenna will ensure that satellites at all elevation s can be \nseen, and therefore, accurate fix measurements are obtained.  \n \nIt is recommended to use an active GPS/GLONASS /BEIDOU  antenna. In a typical application, SIM68D  with \nan active antenna can get a tra cking sensitivity about 3dB better than SIM68D  with a passive antenna.  \n4.9.1 Antenna Interface  \nThe SIM68D  receive s L1 and L5 band signals from GPS /GLONASS /BEIDOU  satellites , The RF signal is \nconnected to the RF_IN pin. And the trace from RF_IN to antenna should be controlled to 50Ω impendence.  \n \nTo suit the physical design of individual applications the RF interface pad can lead to two  alternatives:  \n \n\uf06c Recommended approach: solderable RF coaxial cable assembly  antenna connector , such a s HRS’  \nU.FL -R-SMT(10) connector  or I-PEX’ s 2027 9-001E -01 RF connector . \n\uf06c SMA connector.  \n \nSIM68D  Hardware Design  V1.02 \nwww.simcom.com                                                                         24 / 35  \n4.9.2 Antenna Choice Consideration  \nTo obtain excellent G NSS reception performance, a good antenna will always be required.

The calculated shelf life for dry packed SMD packages is a minimum of 12 months from the \nbag seal date, when stored in a non  condensing atmospheric environment of <40°C/90% RH.   \n \nTable  13 lists floor life for di fferent MSL levels in the IPC/JDEC specification :  \nTable  14: Moisture Classification Level and Floor Life  \nLevel  Floor Life(out of bag)at factory ambient ≦+30℃/60%RH or as \nstated  \n1 Unlimited at ≦+30℃/85% RH  \n2 1 year  \n2a 4 weeks  \n3 168 hours  \n4 72 hours  \n5 48 hours  \n5a 24 hours  \n6 Mandatory bake before use. After bake, module must be reflowed within the \ntime limit specified on the label.  \n \nFactory floor life is 1 week for MSL 3 , SIM68D  must be processed and soldered within the time . If this time \nis exceeded, or the humidity indicator card in the sealed package indicates that they have been expo sed to \nmoisture, the devices need to be pre -baked before the reflow solder process.  \n \n \nSIM68D  Hardware Design  V1.02 \nwww.simcom.com                                                                         32 / 35  \nBoth encapsulate and substrate materials absorb moisture. IPC/ JEDEC specification J -STD-020 must be \nobserved to prevent cracking and delamination associated with the "popcorn" effect during reflow sol dering. \nThe popcorn effect can be described as miniature explosions of evaporating moisture. Baking before \nprocessing is required in the following cases:  \n \n\uf06c Humidity indicator card: At least one circular indicator is no longer blue  \n\uf06c Floor life or environmental requirements after opening the seal have been exceeded, e.g. exposure to  \nexcessive seasonal humidity.  \n \nRefer to S ection 4 of IPC/JEDEC J -STD-033 for recommended baking procedures.  \n \n \n \n \nOxidation Risk: Baking SMD packages may cause oxidation and/or inter  metallic growth of the \nterminations, which if excessive can result in solder  ability problems during board assembly . The \ntemperature and time for baking SMD packages are therefore limited by solder  ability considerations. \nThe cumulative bake time at a temperature greater than 90°C and up to 125°C shall not exceed 96 \nhours.  \n6.5 ESD handling precautions  \nSIM68D  modules are Electrostatic Sensitive Devices (ESD). Observe precautions for \nhandling!  \nFailure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the GPS receiver!  \n \nGPS receivers are Electrostatic Sensitive Devices (ESD) and require special precautions when h andling. \nParticular care must be exercised when handling patch antennas, due to the risk of electrostatic cha rges. In \naddition to standard ESD safety practices, the following measures should be taken into account whene ver \nhandling the receiver:  \n \nUnless the re is a galvanic coupling between the local GND (i.e. the work Table) and the PCB GND, then the \nfirst point of contact when handling the PCB shall always be between the local GND and PCB GND.  \nBefore mounting an antenna patch, connect ground of the d evice  \n \nWhen handling the RF pin, do not come into contact with any charged capacitors and be careful when \ncontacting materials that can develop charges (e.g. patch antenna ~10pF, coax cable ~50 -80pF/m, \nsoldering iron, …)  \nTo prevent electrostatic discharg e thro ugh the RF input, do not touch the mounted patch antenna.  \n \nWhen soldering RF connectors and patch antennas to the receiver’s RF pin, the user must make sure to \nuse an ESD safe soldering iron (tip).  \n6.6 Shipment  \nSIM68D  is designed and packaged to be processed in an automatic assembly line , and it is now packaged  \nin SIM68D  tray. \n \nNOTE  \n \n \nSIM68D  Hardware Design  V1.02 \nwww.simcom.com                                                                         33 / 35  \n \n \n7.
