The PEX 8748 is \nwell suited for fan-out , aggregation, and peer-to-peer traffic patterns. \n \nMulti-Host Architecture \nThe PEX 8748 employs an enhanced version of PLX’s field tested PEX 8648 \nPCIe switch architecture, which allows users to configure the device in legacy \nsingle-host mode or multi-host mode with up to six host ports capable of 1+1 \n(one active & one backup) or N+1 (N ac tive & one backup) host failover. This \npowerful architectural enhancement enabl es users to build PCIe based systems \nto support high-availability, failover, redundant, or clustered systems.    \n \nHigh Performance & Low Packet Latency \nThe PEX 8748 architecture supports packet cut-thru with a maximum \nlatency of 100ns (x16 to x16). This, combined with large packet memory, \nflexible common buffer/FC credit pool and non-blocking internal switch \narchitecture, provides full line rate on all ports for performance-hungry \napplications such as servers and switch fabrics . The low latency enables \napplications to achieve high throughput and performance. In addition to low latency, the device supports a packet payload size of up to 2048 bytes, enabling the user to achieve  even higher throughput.  \n Data Integrity \nThe PEX 8748 provides  end-to-end CRC  (ECRC) protection and Poison  bit \nsupport to enable designs that require end-to-end data integrity . PLX also \nsupports data path parity and memory (RAM) error correction circuitry \nthroughout the internal data path s as packets pass through the switch. \n \nFlexible Configuration \nThe PEX 8748’s 12 ports can be \nconfigured to lane widths of x1, x2, x4, x8, or x16. Flexible buffer allocation, along with the device's \nflexible packet flow control,  \nmaximizes throughput for \napplications where more traffic flows in the downstream, rather \nthan upstream, direction. Any \nport can be designated as the \nupstream port, which can be \nchanged dynamically. Figure 1 shows some of the PEX 8748’s common port configurations in legacy Single-Host mode\n. Figure 1.

In Multi-Host mode, a virtual switch\n is created \nfor each host port and its associated downstream ports \ninside the device. The traffic between the ports of a virtual \nswitch is completely isolated from the traffic in other virtual switches. Figure 2 illustrates some configurations of the PEX 8748 in Multi-Host mode where each ellipse represents a virtual switch inside the device.  \n \nThe PEX 8748 also provides several ways to \nconfigure its \nregisters.

The performance PAK \nfeatures consists of the Read Pacing, Multicast, and Dynamic Buffer Pool. \nRead Pacing \nThe Read Pacing feature allows users to throttle the amount of read requestsdevices. When a dreads back-to-back, the Root Complex gets tied up inserving that downstream port. If that port has a narrow\nand is therefore slow in receiving these read packets from \nthe Root Complex, then other downstream ports may become starved – thus, impacting performance. The Read Pacing feature enhances performances by allowing for the adequate servicing of all downstream devices. \nMulticast \nThe Multicast feature enables the copying of data (packets)\nfrom one ingress port to multiple (up to 11) egr\none transactiographics, storage, security, and redundant applications, among others. Multicast relieves the CPU from having to conduct multiple redundant transactions, resulting in \nhigher system performance. \nDynamic Buffer Pool \nThe PEX 8748 employs a dynamic buffer pool for Flo\nControl (FC) management. Ascheme which assigns fixed,PLX’s dynamic buffer allocation scheme utilizes a \ncommon pool of FC Credits which are shared by other \nports. This shared buffer pool is fully programmable by the user, so FC credits can be allocated among the portsneeded. Not only does this prevent wasted buffers and inappropriate buffer assignments, any unallocated buffers remain in the common buffer pool and can then be used\nfor faster FC credit updates.  \nvision PAK™ \nAnother PLX exclusive, visiousers can use to h\nvisionPAK features consist of Performance Monitoring, SerDes Eye Capture, Error Injection, SerDes Loopback, and more.  \nPerformance Monitoring \nThe PEX 8748’s real time performance monitoring allow\nusers to liter\neach port as traffic passes througSoftware Development Kit (SDK).

Figure 6 shows a server design where, in a quad or multi processor system, users can assign endpoints/slots to CPU cores to distribute the system load.

In Figure 7, the PEX 8748 is \nbeing shared by four different servers (hosts) with each \nserver is running its own applications (I/Os). The PEX 8748 assigns the endpoints to the appropriate host and \nisolates them from the other hosts.  \n \nHost Failover  \nThe PEX 8748 can also be utilized in applications where \nhost failover is required. In the below application (Figure 8), two hosts may be active si multaneously and controlling \ntheir own domains while exchange status information \nthrough doorbell registers or I\n2C interface. The devices can \nbe programmed to trigger fail-over if the heartbeat \ninformation is not provided. In the event of a failure, the surviving device will reset the endpoints connected to \nthe failing CPU and \nenumerate them in its own domain without impacting the operation of endpoints already in its domain. \n                            Figure 8. Host Fail-Over \n \nN+1 Fail-Over in Storage Systems  \nThe PEX 8748’s Multi-Host feature can also be used to \ndevelop storage array clusters where each host manages a \nset of storage devices independent of others (Figure 9). \nUsers can designate one of the hosts as the failover-host for all the other hosts while actively managing its own endpoints. The failover-host will communicate with other hosts for status/heartbeat information and execute a failover event if/when it gets triggered.
