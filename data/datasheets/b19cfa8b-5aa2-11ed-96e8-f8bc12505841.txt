The \nhigh-power output drivers are capable of driving a variety of load configurations, including up to four channels \nof single-ended 16- Ω headphones using ac-coupling capacitors, or stereo 16- Ω headphones in a capacitorless \noutput configuration.\nThe stereo audio DAC supports sampling rates from 8 kHz to 96 kHz and includes programmable digital filtering \nin the DAC path for 3D, bass, treble, midrange effects, speaker equalization, and de-emphasis for 32-kHz, \n44.1-kHz, and 48-kHz rates. The stereo audio ADC supports sampling rates from 8 kHz to 96 kHz and is \npreceded by programmable gain amplifiers or AGC that can provide up to 59.5-dB analog gain for low-level \nmicrophone inputs. The TLV320AIC3106 provides an extremely high range of programmability for both attack \n(8 ms–1,408 ms) and for decay (0.05 s–22.4 s). This extended AGC range allows the AGC to be tuned for many \ntypes of applications.\nFor battery saving applications where neither analog nor digital signal processing are required, the device can \nbe put in a special analog signal passthru mode. This mode significantly reduces power consumption, as most of \nthe device is powered down during this pass through operation.\nThe serial control bus supports SPI or I2C protocols, while the serial audio data bus is programmable for I2S, \nleft/right-justified, DSP, or TDM modes. A highly programmable PLL is included for flexible clock generation and \nsupport for all standard audio rates from a wide range of available MCLKs, varying from 512 kHz to 50 MHz, with \nspecial attention paid to the most popular cases of 12-MHz, 13-MHz, 16-MHz, 19.2-MHz, and 19.68-MHz system \nclocks.\nThe TLV320AIC3106 operates from an analog supply of 2.7 V–3.6 V, a digital core supply of 1.65 V–1.95 V, and \na digital I/O supply of 1.1 V–3.6 V. The device is available in the 5-mm × 5-mm, 80-ball MicroStar Junior™ BGA \npackage and a 7-mm × 7-mm, 48-lead QFN package.\n6 Device Comparison Table\nDEVICE NAME DESCRIPTION\nTLV320AIC3106 Low-Power Stereo CODEC with 10 Inputs, 7 Outputs, Speaker/HP Amp and Enhanced Digital Effects.\nTLV320AIC3101 Same as TLV320AIC3106, but with 6 inputs, 6 outputs and Speaker/HP Amp.\nTLV320AIC3104 Same as TLV320AIC3106, but with 6 inputs and 6 outputs.\nTLV320AIC3105 Same as TLV320AIC3106, but with 6 Single-ended inputs and 6 outputs.\nTLV320AIC3107 Same as TLV320AIC3106, but with 7 Inputs, 6 Outputs and Integrated Mono Class-D Amplifier.www.ti.comTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\n7 Pin Configuration and Functions\n4□81 1□2\n1□3\n2□4\n2□5 3□63□7\nSolder the VQFN thermal pad to the ground plane (DRVSS).\nFigure 7-1.

Available in a 5x5mm 80-ball BGA (with 51 balls actually used) and 7x7mm 48-lead QFN, the \nproduct integrates a host of features to reduce cost, board space, and power consumption in space-constrained, \nbattery-powered, portable applications.\nThe TLV320AIC3106 consists of the following blocks:\n•Stereo audio multi-bit delta-sigma DAC (8 kHz–96 kHz)\n•Stereo audio multi-bit delta-sigma ADC (8 kHz–96 kHz)\n•Programmable digital audio effects processing (3-D, bass, treble, mid-range, EQ, notch filter, de-emphasis)\n•Six audio inputs\n•Four high-power audio output drivers (headphone drive capability)\n•Three fully differential line output drivers\n•Fully programmable PLL\n•Headphone/headset jack detection with interrupt\nCommunication to the TLV320AIC3106 for control is pin-selectable (using the SELECT pin) as either SPI \nor I2C. The SPI interface requires that the Slave Select signal (MFP0) be driven low to communicate with \nthe TLV320AIC3106. Data is then shifted into or out of the TLV320AIC3106 under control of the host \nmicroprocessor, which also provides the serial data clock. The I2C interface supports both standard and fast \ncommunication modes, and also enables cascading of up to four multiple codecs on the same I2C bus through \nthe use of two pins for addressing (MFP0, MFP1).www.ti.comTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\n10.2 Functional Block Diagram\nAudio□Serial□Bus□Interface\nMIC3L /□LINE3L\nPGA\n0/+59.5dB\n0.5dB□stepsADC ++\n+\nHPRCOMHPLCOMHPLOUT\nVCM\nVCMDAC\nL\n+Volume\nControlEffectsDINDOUT\nBCLK\nWCLK\nDINLDINR DOUTL DOUTR AGC\nSW-D2\nSW-D1\nSPI□/□I2C□Serial□Control□BusSELECT CSEL/I2C_ADR0SCLK/I2C_ADR1 MOSI/GPIOMISO/GPIOBias/\nReferenceMICBIAS SCL/GPIOSDA/GPIO RESET MICDETVoltage□SuppliesDVDD DRVDDDRVDDDRVSSDRVSS DVSSIOVDD AVDD_ADCAVSS_ADCAVDD_DACAVSS_DACAudio□Clock\nGenerationMCLK GPIO_1GPIO_2+\n+\n+HPROUT\nMIC3R□/□LINE3RADCPGA\n0/+59.5dB\n0.5dB□steps+ DACRVolume\nControlEffectsAGC\nSW-D3SW-D4\n+MONO_LOP\nMONO_LOMLINE1RP\nLINE2RMLINE2RP\nLINE1RMSW-R0\nSW-R3SW-R1SW-R2\nSW-R4\nSW-R5RIGHT_LOP\nRIGHT_LOMLINE1LP\nLINE2LMLINE2LP\nLINE1LMSW-L0\nSW-L3SW-L1SW-L2\nSW-L4\nSW-L5LEFT_LOP\nLEFT_LOM\nMIC2RM□□/□LINE2RMMIC2RP /□LINE2RPLINE2RP\nLINE2RMMIC1RM□□/□LINE1RMMIC1RP /□LINE1RPLINE1RP\nLINE1RMMIC2LM□□/□LINE2LMMIC2LP /□LINE2LPLINE2LP\nLINE2LM\nMIC1LM□□/□LINE1LMMIC1LP /□LINE1LPLINE1LP\nLINE1LM\n10.3 Feature Description\n10.3.1 Hardware Reset\nThe TLV320AIC3106 requires a hardware reset after power-up for proper operation. After all power supplies \nare at their specified values, the RESET  pin must be driven low for at least 10 ns. If this reset sequence is not \nperformed, the TLV320AIC3106 may not respond properly to register reads/writes.\n10.3.2 Digital Audio Data Serial Interface\nAudio data is transferred between the host processor and the TLV320AIC3106 via the digital audio data serial \ninterface, or audio bus . The audio bus on this device is very flexible, including left or right justified data options, \nsupport for I2S or PCM protocols, programmable data length options, a TDM mode for multichannel operation, \nvery flexible master/slave configurability for each bus clock line, and the ability to communicate with multiple \ndevices within a system directly.\nThe data serial interface uses two sets of pins for communication between external devices, with the particular \npin used controlled through register programming. This configuration is illustrated in Figure 10-1 .TLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nAudio□Serial□Data□BusDOUT\nGPIO1 GPIO2 MFP3WCLK BCLK DINFigure 10-1. Alternate Audio Bus Mulitplexing Function\nIn cases where MFP3 is needed for a secondary device digital input, the TLV320AIC3106 must be used in I2C \nmode (when in SPI mode, MFP3 is used as the SPI bus MOSI pin and thus cannot be used here as an alternate \ndigital input source).\nThis mux capability allows the TLV320AIC3106 to communicate with two separate devices with independent \nI2S/PCM buses. An example of such an application is a cellphone containing a Bluetooth transceiver with \nPCM/I2S interface, as shown in Figure 10-2 . The applications processor can be connected to the WCLK, BCLK, \nDIN, DOUT pins on the TLV320AIC3106, while a Bluetooth device with PCM interface can be connected to the \nGPIO1, GPIO2, MFP3, and DOUT pins on the TLV320AIC3106. By programming the registers via I2C control, \nthe applications processor can determine which device is communicating with the TLV320AIC3106. This is \nattractive in cases where the TLV320AIC3106 can be configured to communicate data with the Bluetooth device, \nthen the applications processor can be put into a low power sleep mode, while voice/audio transmission still \noccurs between the Bluetooth device and the TLV320AIC3106.\nPossible□Processor Types:\nApplication□Processor,□Multimedia□Processor,\nCompressed Audio□Decoder,□Wireless□Modem,\nBluetooth□Module, Additional Audio/Voice□CodecProcessor\n2Processor\n1\nGPIO2 WCLKBCLKDIN\nDOUT MFP3GPIO1\nAIC3106\nFigure 10-2. TLV320AIC3106 Connected to Multiple Audio Devices\nThe audio bus of the TLV320AIC3106 can be configured for left or right justified, I2S, DSP, or TDM modes of \noperation, where communication with standard telephony PCM interfaces is supported within the TDM mode. \nThese modes are all MSB-first, with data width programmable as 16, 20, 24, or 32 bits. In addition, the word \nclock (WCLK or GPIO1) and bit clock (BCLK or GPIO2) can be independently configured in either Master or \nSlave mode, for flexible connectivity to a wide variety of processorswww.ti.comTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nThe word clock (WCLK or GPIO1) is used to define the beginning of a frame, and may be programmed as either \na pulse or a square-wave signal. The frequency of this clock corresponds to the maximum of the selected ADC \nand DAC sampling frequencies.\nThe bit clock (BCLK or GPIO2) is used to clock in and out the digital audio data across the serial bus. When \nin Master mode, this signal can be programmed in two further modes: continuous transfer mode, and 256-clock \nmode. In continuous transfer mode, only the minimal number of bit clocks needed to transfer the audio data are \ngenerated, so in general the number of bit clocks per frame will be two times the data width. For example, if \ndata width is chosen as 16 bits, then 32 bit clocks will be generated per frame. If the bit clock signal in master \nmode will be used by a PLL in another device, it is recommended that the 16-bit or 32-bit data width selections \nbe used. These cases result in a low jitter bit clock signal being generated, having frequencies of 32 × f S or 64 \n× fS. In the cases of 20-bit and 24-bt data width in master mode, the bit clocks generated in each frame will \nnot all be of equal period, due to the device not having a clean 40 × f S or 48 × f S clock signal readily available. \nThe average frequency of the bit clock signal is still accurate in these cases (being 40 × f S or 48 × f S), but the \nresulting clock signal has higher jitter than in the 16-bit and 32-bit cases.\nIn 256-clock mode, a constant 256 bit clocks per frame are generated, independent of the data width chosen. \nThe TLV320AIC3106 further includes programmability to 3-state the DOUT line during all bit clocks when valid \ndata is not being sent. By combining this capability with the ability to program at what bit clock in a frame the \naudio data will begin, time-division multiplexing (TDM) can be accomplished, resulting in multiple codecs able to \nuse a single audio serial data bus.\nWhen the audio serial data bus is powered down while configured in master mode, the pins associated with the \ninterface will be put into a 3-state output condition.\n10.3.2.1 Right-Justified Mode\nIn right-justified mode, the LSB of the left channel is valid on the rising edge of the bit clock preceding the falling \nedge of word clock.

DSP Serial Bus Mode Operation\n10.3.2.5 TDM Data Transfer\nTime-division multiplexed data transfer can be realized in any of the above transfer modes if the 256-clock bit \nclock mode is selected, although it is recommended to be used in either left-justified mode or DSP mode. By \nchanging the programmable offset, the bit clock in each frame where the data begins can be changed, and the \nserial data output driver (DOUT) can also be programmed to 3-state during all bit clocks except when valid data \nis being put onto the bus. This allows other codecs to be programmed with different offsets and to drive their \ndata onto the same DOUT line, just in a different slot. For incoming data, the codec simply ignores data on the \nbus except where it is expected based on the programmed offset.\nNote that the location of the data when an offset is programmed is different, depending on what transfer mode is \nselected. In DSP mode, both left and right channels of data are transferred immediately adjacent to each other in \nthe frame. This differs from left-justified mode, where the left and right channel data will always be a half-frame \napart in each frame. In this case, as the offset is programmed from zero to some higher value, both the left and \nright channel data move across the frame, but still stay a full half-frame apart from each other. This is depicted in \nFigure 10-7  for the two cases.TLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nN-1 N-2 1 0 N-1 N-2 1 0word\nclock\nbit clock\ndata\nin/out\nRight□Channel□Data\nRight□Channel□DataLeft□Channel□Data\nLeft□Channel□DataN-1 N-2 1 0 N-1 N-2 1 0word\nclock\nbit clock\ndata\nin/outDSP Mode\nLeft□Justified□Mode\noffsetoffset\noffsetFigure 10-7. DSP Mode and Left Justified Modes, Showing the Effect of a Programmed Data Word Offset\n10.3.3 Audio Data Converters\nThe TLV320AIC3106 supports the following standard audio sampling rates: 8 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 12 kHz, 16 kHz, \n22.05 kHz, 24 kHz, 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, and 96 kHz. The converters can also operate at \ndifferent sampling rates in various combinations, which are described further below.\nThe data converters are based on the concept of an f S(ref) rate that is used internal to the part, and it is related \nto the actual sampling rates of the converters through a series of ratios. For typical sampling rates, f S(ref) will \nbe either 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, although it can realistically be set over a wider range of rates up to 53 kHz, with \nadditional restrictions applying if the PLL is used. This concept is used to set the sampling rates of the ADC and \nDAC, and also to enable high quality playback of low sampling rate data, without high frequency audible noise \nbeing generated.\nThe sampling rate of the ADC and DAC can be set to f S(ref)/NDAC or 2×f S(ref)/NDAC, with NDAC being 1, 1.5, 2, \n2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, or 6.\nWhile only one f S(ref) can be used at a time in the part, the ADC and DAC sampling rates can differ from each \nother by using different NADC and NDAC divider ratios for each. For example, with f S(ref)=44.1-kHz, the DAC \nsampling rate can be set to 44.1-kHz by using NDAC=1, while the ADC sampling rate can be set to 8.018-kHz \nby using NADC=5.5.\nWhen the ADCs and DACs are operating at different sampling rates, an additional word clock is required, to \nprovide information regarding where data begins for the ADC versus the DAC. In this case, the standard bit clock \nsignal (which can be supplied through the BCLK pin or through GPIO2) is used to transfer both ADC and DAC \ndata, the standard word clock signal is used to identify the start of the DAC data, and a separate ADC word clock \nsignal (denoted ADWK) is used.

The BCLK or \nGPIO2 inputs can also be used to generate the internal audio master clock.\nThis design also allows the PLL to be used for an entirely separate purpose in a system, if the audio codec is \nnot powered up. The user can supply a separate clock to GPIO2, route this through the PLL, with the resulting \noutput clock driven out GPIO1, for use by other devices in the system\nA primary concern is proper operation of the codec at various sample rates with the limited MCLK frequencies \navailable in the system. This device includes a highly programmable PLL to accommodate such situations easily. \nThe integrated PLL can generate audio clocks from a wide variety of possible MCLK inputs, with particular focus \npaid to the standard MCLK rates already widely used.\nWhen the PLL is disabled:\nfS(ref) = CLKDIV_IN / (128 × Q) (1)TLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nwhere:\n•Q = 2, 3, …, 17\nCLKDIV_IN can be MCLK, BCLK, or GPIO2, selected by register 102, bits D7-D6.\nNote\nWhen NDAC = 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, or 5.5, odd values of Q are not allowed.

The ADC supports sampling rates \nfrom 8 kHz to 48 kHz in single-rate mode, and up to 96 kHz in dual-rate mode. Whenever the ADC or DAC is in \noperation, the device requires that an audio master clock be provided and appropriate audio clock generation be \nset up within the device.TLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nIn order to provide optimal system power dissipation, the stereo ADC can be powered one channel at a time, to \nsupport the case where only mono record capability is required. In addition, both channels can be fully powered \nor entirely powered down.\nThe integrated digital decimation filter removes high-frequency content and downsamples the audio data from an \ninitial sampling rate of 128 f S to the final output sampling rate of f S. The decimation filter provides a linear phase \noutput response with a group delay of 17/f S. The –3-dB bandwidth of the decimation filter extends to 0.45 f S and \nscales with the sample rate (f S). The filter has minimum 75-dB attenuation over the stop band from 0.55 f S to 64 \nfS. Independent digital high-pass filters are also included with each ADC channel, with a corner frequency that \ncan be independently set.\nBecause of the oversampling nature of the audio ADC and the integrated digital decimation filtering, \nrequirements for analog antialiasing filtering are very relaxed. The TLV320AIC3106 integrates a second-order \nanalog antialiasing filter with 20-dB attenuation at 1 MHz. This filter, combined with the digital decimation filter, \nprovides sufficient antialiasing filtering without requiring additional external components.\nThe ADC is preceded by a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), which allows analog gain control from 0 dB to \n59.5 dB in steps of 0.5 dB. The PGA gain changes are implemented with an internal soft-stepping algorithm \nthat only changes the actual volume level by one 0.5-dB step every one or two ADC output samples, depending \non the register programming (see page 0, registers 19 and 22). This soft-stepping ensures that volume control \nchanges occur smoothly with no audible artifacts. On reset, the PGA gain defaults to a mute condition, and on \npower down, the PGA soft-steps the volume to mute before shutting down. A read-only flag is set whenever the \ngain applied by PGA equals the desired value set by the register. The soft-stepping control can also be disabled \nby programming a register bit. When soft stepping is enabled, the audio master clock must be applied to the part \nafter the ADC power-down register is written to ensure the soft-stepping to mute has completed. When the ADC \npower-down flag is no longer set, the audio master clock can be shut down.\n10.3.3.2.1 Stereo Audio ADC High-Pass Filter\nOften in audio applications it is desirable to remove the dc offset from the converted audio data stream. The \nTLV320AIC3106 has a programmable first-order high-pass filter which can be used for this purpose. The digital \nfilter coefficients are in 16-bit format and therefore use two 8-bit registers for each of the three coefficients, N0, \nN1, and D1. The transfer function of the digital high-pass filter is of the form:\nH(z)/C0043N0/C0041N1/C0032z/C00421\n32, 768/C0042D1/C0032z/C00421\n(5)\nProgramming the left channel is done by writing to page 1, registers 65–70, and the right channel is programmed \nby writing to page 1, registers 71–76. After the coefficients have been loaded, these ADC high-pass filter \ncoefficients can be selected by writing to page 0, register 107, bits D7–D6, and the high-pass filter can be \nenabled by writing to page 0, register 12, bits D7–D4.\n10.3.3.2.2 Automatic Gain Control (AGC)\nAn automatic gain control (AGC) circuit is included with the ADC and can be used to maintain nominally \nconstant output signal amplitude when recording speech signals (it can be fully disabled if not desired). This \ncircuitry automatically adjusts the PGA gain as the input signal becomes overly loud or very weak, such as \nwhen a person speaking into a microphone moves closer or farther from the microphone. The AGC algorithm \nhas several programmable settings, including target gain, attack and decay time constants, noise threshold, \nand maximum PGA gain applicable that allow the algorithm to be fine tuned for any particular application. The \nalgorithm uses the absolute average of the signal (which is the average of the absolute value of the signal) as a \nmeasure of the nominal amplitude of the output signal.\nNote that completely independent AGC circuitry is included with each ADC channel with entirely independent \ncontrol over the algorithm from one channel to the next. This is attractive in cases where two microphones \nare used in a system, but may have different placement in the end equipment and require different dynamic \nperformance for optimal system operation.www.ti.comTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\n10.3.3.2.2.1 Target Level\nThe target level represents the nominal output level at which the AGC attempts to hold the ADC output signal \nlevel. The TLV320AIC3106 allows programming of eight different target levels, which can be programmed from \n–5.5 dB to –24 dB relative to a full-scale signal. Since the device reacts to the signal absolute average and \nnot to peak levels, it is recommended that the target level be set with enough margin to avoid clipping at the \noccurrence of loud sounds.\n10.3.3.2.2.2 Attack Time\nThe Attack time determines how quickly the AGC circuitry reduces the PGA gain when the input signal is too \nloud. It can be varied from 7 ms to 1,408 ms. The extended Right Channel Attack time can be programmed by \nwriting to Page 0, Registers 103, and Left Channel is programmed by writing to Page 0, Register 105.\n10.3.3.2.2.3 Decay Time\nThe decay time determines how quickly the PGA gain is increased when the input signal is too low. It can be \nvaried in the range from 0.05 s to 22.4 s. The extended Right Channel Decay time can be programmed by \nwriting to Page 0, Registers 104, and Left Channel is programmed by writing to Page 0, Register 106.\nThe actual AGC decay time maximum is based on a counter length, so the maximum decay time will scale with \nthe clock set up that is used. Table 10-2  shows the relationship of the NADC ratio to the maximum time available \nfor the AGC decay. In practice, these maximum times are extremely long for audio applications and should not \nlimit any practical AGC decay time that is needed by the system.\nTable 10-2.

The gain stays at 0 dB unless the input speech signal average rises above the noise threshold \nsetting. This ensures that noise does not get gained up in the absence of speech. Noise threshold level in the \nAGC algorithm is programmable from –30 dB to –90 dB relative to full scale. A disable noise gate feature is \nalso available. This operation includes programmable debounce and hysteresis functionality to avoid the AGC \ngain from cycling between high gain and 0 dB when signals are near the noise threshold level. When the noise \nthreshold flag is set, the status of gain applied by the AGC and the saturation flag should be ignored.\n10.3.3.2.2.5 Maximum PGA Gain Applicable\nMaximum PGA gain applicable  allows the user to restrict the maximum PGA gain that can be applied by the \nAGC algorithm. This can be used for limiting PGA gain in situations where environmental noise is greater than \nprogrammed noise threshold. It can be programmed from 0 dB to 59.5 dB in steps of 0.5 dB.TLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nDecay T imeTarget\nLevelInput\nSignal\nOutput\nSignal\nAGC\nGain\nAttack\nTimeFigure 10-9. Typical Operation of the AGC Algorithm During Speech Recording\nNote that the time constants here are correct when the ADC is not in double-rate audio mode. The time \nconstants are achieved using the f S(ref) value programmed in the control registers. However, if the f S(ref) is set \nin the registers to, for example, 48 kHz, but the actual audio clock or PLL programming actually results in a \ndifferent f S(ref) in practice, then the time constants would not be correct.\nThe actual AGC decay time maximum is based on a counter length, so the maximum decay time scales with the \nclock set up that is used. Table 10-2  shows the relationship of the NADC ratio to the maximum time available for \nthe AGC decay. In practice, these maximum times are extremely long for audio applications and should not limit \nany practical AGC decay time that is needed by the system.\n10.3.3.3 Stereo Audio DAC\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes a stereo audio DAC supporting sampling rates from 8 kHz to 96 kHz. Each \nchannel of the stereo audio DAC consists of a digital audio processing block, a digital interpolation filter, \nmulti-bit digital delta-sigma modulator, and an analog reconstruction filter. The DAC is designed to provide \nenhanced performance at low sampling rates through increased oversampling and image filtering, thereby \nkeeping quantization noise generated within the delta-sigma modulator and signal images strongly suppressed \nwithin the audio band to beyond 20 kHz. This is realized by keeping the upsampled rate constant at 128 × f S(ref) \nand changing the oversampling ratio as the input sample rate is changed. For an f S(ref) of 48 kHz, the digital \ndelta-sigma modulator always operates at a rate of 6.144 MHz. This ensures that quantization noise generated \nwithin the delta-sigma modulator stays low within the frequency band below 20 kHz at all sample rates. Similarly, \nfor an f S(ref) rate of 44.1 kHz, the digital delta-sigma modulator always operates at a rate of 5.6448 MHz.\nThe following restrictions apply in the case when the PLL is powered down and double-rate audio mode is \nenabled in the DAC.\nAllowed Q values = 4, 8, 9, 12, 16\nQ values where equivalent f S(ref) can be achieved by turning on PLL\nQ = 5, 6, 7 (set P = 5 / 6 / 7 and K = 16.0 and PLL enabled)\nQ = 10, 14 (set P = 5, 7 and K = 8.0 and PLL enabled)www.ti.comTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\n10.3.3.3.1 Digital Audio Processing for Playback\nThe DAC channel consists of optional filters for de-emphasis and bass, treble, midrange level adjustment, \nspeaker equalization, and 3-D effects processing. The de-emphasis function is implemented by a programmable \ndigital filter block with fully programmable coefficients (see Page-1/Reg-21-26 for left channel, Page-1/Reg-47-52 \nfor right channel). If de-emphasis is not required in a particular application, this programmable filter block can be \nused for some other purpose. The de-emphasis filter transfer function is given by:\n-1\n-1N0 N1 x zH(z) =\n32768 D1 x z/c43\n/c45\n(6)\nwhere the N0, N1, and D1 coefficients are fully programmable individually for each channel. The coefficients that \nshould be loaded to implement standard de-emphasis filters are given in Table 10-3 .\nTable 10-3. De-Emphasis Coefficients for Common Audio Sampling Rates\nSAMPLING FREQUENCY N0 N1 D1\n32-kHz 16950 –1220 17037\n44.1-kHz 15091 –2877 20555\n48-kHz(1)14677 –3283 21374\n(1) The 48-kHz coefficients listed in Table 10-3  are used as defaults.\nIn addition to the de-emphasis filter block, the DAC digital effects processing includes a fourth order digital IIR \nfilter with programmable coefficients (one set per channel). This filter is implemented as cascade of two biquad \nsections with frequency response given by:\n/C0466N0/C00412/C0032N1/C0032z/C00421/C0041N2/C0032z/C00422\n32768 /C00422/C0032D1/C0032z/C00421/C0042D2/C0032z/C00422/C0467/C0466N3/C00412/C0032N4/C0032z/C00421/C0041N5/C0032z/C00422\n32768 /C00422/C0032D4/C0032z/C00421/C0042D5/C0032z/C00422/C0467\n(7)\nThe N and D coefficients are fully programmable, and the entire filter can be enabled or bypassed. The structure \nof the filtering when configured for independent channel processing is shown below in Figure 10-10 , with LB1 \ncorresponding to the first left-channel biquad filter using coefficients N0, N1, N2, D1, and D2. LB2 similarly \ncorresponds to the second left-channel biquad filter using coefficients N3, N4, N5, D4, and D5. The RB1 and \nRB2 filters refer to the first and second right-channel biquad filters, respectively.\nLB1 LB2\nRB1 RB2\nFigure 10-10.

The default N and D coefficients in the part are given in Table \n10-4 and implement a shelving filter with 0-dB gain from DC to approximately 150 Hz, at which point it rolls off to \na 3-dB attenuation for higher frequency signals, thus giving a 3-dB boost to signals below 150 Hz. The N and D \ncoefficients are represented by 16-bit two’s complement numbers with values ranging from –32768 to 32767.\nTable 10-4.

The architecture of this processing mode, and the programmable filters available for use in the \nsystem, is shown in Figure 10-11 . Note that the programmable attenuation block provides a method of adjusting \nthe level of 3-D effect introduced into the final stereo output. This combined with the fully programmable biquad \nfilters in the system enables the user to fully optimize the audio effects for a particular system and provide \nextensive differentiation from other systems using the same device.\nB0155-01LB1\nRB2AttenLB2 L\n++\n+++\n– –+\n+RTo□Left□Channel\nTo□Right□Channel\nFigure 10-11. Architecture of the Digital Audio Processing When 3-D Effects are Enabled\nIt is recommended that the digital effects filters should be disabled while the filter coefficients are being modified. \nWhile new coefficients are being written to the device over the control port, it is possible that a filter using \npartially updated coefficients may actually implement an unstable system and lead to oscillation or objectionable \naudio output. By disabling the filters, changing the coefficients, and then re-enabling the filters, these types of \neffects can be entirely avoided.\n10.3.3.3.2 Digital Interpolation Filter\nThe digital interpolation filter upsamples the output of the digital audio processing block by the required \noversampling ratio before data is provided to the digital delta-sigma modulator and analog reconstruction filter \nstages. The filter provides a linear phase output with a group delay of 21/f S. In addition, programmable digital \ninterpolation filtering is included to provide enhanced image filtering and reduce signal images caused by the \nupsampling process that are below 20 kHz. For example, upsampling an 8-kHz signal produces signal images at \nmultiples of 8-kHz (i.e., 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 24 kHz, etc.). The images at 8 kHz and 16 kHz are below 20 kHz and still \naudible to the listener; therefore, they must be filtered heavily to maintain a good quality output. The interpolation \nfilter is designed to maintain at least 65-dB rejection of images that land below 7.455 f S. In order to utilize the \nprogrammable interpolation capability, the f S(ref) should be programmed to a higher rate (restricted to be in the www.ti.comTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nrange of 39 kHz to 53 kHz when the PLL is in use), and the actual f S is set using the NDAC divider. For example, \nif fS = 8 kHz is required, then f S(ref) can be set to 48 kHz, and the DAC f S set to f S(ref)/6. This ensures that all \nimages of the 8-kHz data are sufficiently attenuated well beyond a 20-kHz audible frequency range.\n10.3.3.3.3 Delta-Sigma Audio DAC\nThe stereo audio DAC incorporates a third order multi-bit delta-sigma modulator followed by an analog \nreconstruction filter. The DAC provides high-resolution, low-noise performance, using oversampling and noise \nshaping techniques. The analog reconstruction filter design consists of a 6-tap analog FIR filter followed by a \ncontinuous time RC filter. The analog FIR operates at a rate of 128 × f S(ref) (6.144 MHz when f S(ref) = 48 kHz, \n5.6448 MHz when f S(ref) = 44.1 kHz). Note that the DAC analog performance may be degraded by excessive \nclock jitter on the MCLK input. Therefore, care must be taken to keep jitter on this clock to a minimum.\n10.3.3.3.4 Audio DAC Digital Volume Control\nThe audio DAC includes a digital volume control block which implements a programmable digital gain. The \nvolume level can be varied from 0 dB to –63.5 dB in 0.5-dB steps, in addition to a mute bit, independently for \neach channel. The volume level of both channels can also be changed simultaneously by the master volume \ncontrol. Gain changes are implemented with a soft-stepping algorithm, which only changes the actual volume by \none step per input sample, either up or down, until the desired volume is reached. The rate of soft-stepping can \nbe slowed to one step per two input samples through a register bit.\nBecause of soft-stepping, the host does not know when the DAC has been actually muted. This may be \nimportant if the host wishes to mute the DAC before making a significant change, such as changing sample \nrates. In order to help with this situation, the device provides a flag back to the host via a read-only register \nbit that alerts the host when the part has completed the soft-stepping and the actual volume has reached the \ndesired volume level. The soft-stepping feature can be disabled through register programming. If soft-stepping is \nenabled, the MCLK signal should be kept applied to the device until the DAC power-down flag is set. When this \nflag is set, the internal soft-stepping process and power down sequence is complete, and the MCLK can then be \nstopped if desired.\nThe TLV320AIC3106 also includes functionality to detect when the user switches on or off the de-emphasis or \ndigital audio processing functions, to first (1) soft-mute the DAC volume control, (2) change the operation of the \ndigital effects processing, and (3) soft-unmute the part. This avoids any possible pop/clicks in the audio output \ndue to instantaneous changes in the filtering. A similar algorithm is used when first powering up or down the \nDAC. The circuit begins operation at power up with the volume control muted, then soft-steps it up to the desired \nvolume level. At power down, the logic first soft-steps the volume down to a mute level, then powers down the \ncircuitry.\n10.3.3.3.5 Increasing DAC Dynamic Range\nThe TLV320AIC3106 allows trading off dynamic range with power consumption. The DAC dynamic range can be \nincreased by writing to Page 0, Register 109 bits D7-D6. The lowest DAC current setting is the default, and the \ndynamic range is displayed in the datasheet table. Increasing the current can increase the DAC dynamic range \nby up to 1.5dB.\n10.3.3.3.6 Analog Output Common-Mode Adjustment\nThe output common-mode voltage and output range of the analog output are determined by an internal bandgap \nreference, in contrast to other codecs that may use a divided version of the supply. This scheme is used to \nreduce the coupling of noise that may be on the supply (such as 217-Hz noise in a GSM cellphone) into the \naudio signal path.\nHowever, due to the possible wide variation in analog supply range (2.7 V – 3.6 V), an output common-mode \nvoltage setting of 1.35 V, which would be used for a 2.7 V supply case, will be overly conservative if the supply \nis actually much larger, such as 3.3 V or 3.6 V. In order to optimize device operation, the TLV320AIC3106 \nincludes a programmable output common-mode level, which can be set by register programming to a level most \nappropriate to the actual supply range used by a particular customer. The output common-mode level can be \nvaried among four different values, ranging from 1.35 V (most appropriate for low supply ranges, near 2.7 V) to \n1.8 V (most appropriate for high supply ranges, near 3.6 V). Note that there is also some limitation on the range \nof DVDD voltage as well in determining which setting is most appropriate.TLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nTable 10-5.

This provides power savings when only a mono playback stream is \nneeded.\n10.3.4 Audio Analog Inputs\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes ten analog audio input pins, which can be configured as up to four fully-differential \npair plus one single-ended pair of audio inputs, or up to six single-ended audio inputs. . These pins connect \nthrough series resistors and switches to the virtual ground terminals of two fully differential opamps (one per \nADC/PGA channel). By selecting to turn on only one set of switches per opamp at a time, the inputs can be \neffectively muxed to each ADC PGA channel.\nBy selecting to turn on multiple sets of switches per opamp at a time, mixing can also be achieved. Mixing \nof multiple inputs can easily lead to PGA outputs that exceed the range of the internal opamps, resulting in \nsaturation and clipping of the mixed output signal. Whenever mixing is being implemented, the user should take \nadequate precautions to avoid such a saturation case from occurring. In general, the mixed signal should not \nexceed 2 V pp (single-ended) or 4 V pp (differential).\nIn most mixing applications, there is also a general need to adjust the levels of the individual signals being \nmixed. For example, if a soft signal and a large signal are to be mixed and played together, the soft signal \ngenerally should be amplified to a level comparable to the large signal before mixing. In order to accommodate \nthis need, the TLV320AIC3106 includes input level control on each of the individual inputs before they are mixed \nor muxed into the ADC PGAs, with gain programmable from 0 dB to –12 dB in 1.5 dB steps. Note that this input \nlevel control is not intended to be a volume control, but instead used occasionally for level setting. Soft-stepping \nof the input level control settings is implemented in this device, with the speed and functionality following the \nsettings used by the ADC PGA for soft-stepping.\nThe TLV320AIC3106 supports the ability to mix up to three fully-differential analog inputs into each ADC PGA \nchannel. Figure 10-12  shows the mixing configuration for the left channel, which can mix the signals LINE1LP-\nLINE1LM, LINE2LP-LINE2LM, and LINE1RP-LINE1RM.\nGAIN=0,−1.5,−3,..,−12dB,MUTE\nLINE1LP\nLINE1LM\nLINE2LP\nLINE2LM\nLINE1RP\nLINE1RMTO LEFT ADC\nPGAGAIN=0,−1.5,−3,..,−12dB, MUTE\nGAIN=0,−1.5,−3,..,−12dB,MUTE\nFigure 10-12.

Note that it is not necessary to mix all three \nfully-differential signals if this is not desired – unnecessary inputs can simply be muted using the input level \ncontrol registers.\nInputs can also be selected as single-ended instead of fully-differential, and mixing or muxing into the ADC \nPGAs is also possible in this mode. It is not possible, however, for an input pair to be selected as fully-differential \nfor connection to one ADC PGA and simultaneously selected as single-ended for connection to the other ADC \nPGA channel. However, it is possible for an input to be selected or mixed into both left and right channel PGAs, \nas long as it has the same configuration for both channels (either both single-ended or both fully-differential).\nFigure 10-13  shows the single-ended mixing configuration for the left channel ADC PGA, which enables mixing \nof the signals LINE1LP, LINE2LP, LINE1RP, MIC3L, and MIC3R.

Detail of the Volume Control and Mixing Function Shown in Figure 10-10  and Figure 10-25 \nThe DAC_L/R signals are the outputs of the stereo audio DAC, which can be steered by register control based \non the requirements of the system. If mixing of the DAC audio with other signals is not required, and the \nDAC output is only needed at the stereo line outputs, then it is recommended to use the routing through path \nDAC_L3/R3 to the fully differential stereo line outputs. This results not only in higher quality output performance, \nbut also in lower power operation, since the analog volume controls and mixing blocks ahead of these drivers \ncan be powered down.\nIf instead the DAC analog output must be routed to multiple output drivers simultaneously (such as to \nLEFT_LOP/M, RIGHT_LOP/M, and MONO_LOP/M) or must be mixed with other analog signals, then the DAC \noutputs should be switched through the DAC_L1/R1 path. This option provides the maximum flexibility for routing \nof the DAC analog signals to the output drivers\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes an output level control on each output driver with limited gain adjustment from 0 \ndB to 9 dB. The output driver circuitry in this device are designed to provide a low distortion output while playing \nfullscale stereo DAC signals at a 0dB gain setting. However, a higher amplitude output can be obtained at the \ncost of increased signal distortion at the output. This output level control allows the user to make this tradeoff \nbased on the requirements of the end equipment. Note that this output level control is not intended to be used as \na standard output volume control. It is expected to be used only sparingly for level setting, that is, adjustment of \nthe fullscale output range of the device.\nThe PGA_L/R signals refer to the outputs of the ADC PGA stages that are similarly passed around the ADC \nto the output stage. Note that because both left- and right-channel signals are routed to all output drivers, a \nmono mix of any of the stereo signals can easily be obtained by setting the volume controls of both left- and \nright-channel signals to –6 dB and mixing them. Undesired signals can also be disconnected from the mix as \nwell through register control.\n10.3.6 Analog High Power Output Drivers\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes four high power output drivers with extensive flexibility in their usage. These \noutput drivers are individually capable of driving 30 mW each into a 16- Ω load in single-ended configuration, and \nthey can be used in pairs connected in bridge-terminated load (BTL) configuration between two driver outputs.\nThe high power output drivers can be configured in a variety of ways, including:\n1.driving up to two fully differential output signals\n2.driving up to four single-ended output signals\n3.driving two single-ended output signals, with one or two of the remaining drivers driving a fixed VCM level, \nfor a pseudo-differential stereo outputTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n34 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nThe output stage architecture leading to the high power output drivers is shown in Figure 10-16 , with the volume \ncontrol and mixing blocks being effectively identical to that shown in Figure 10-15 . Note that each of these \ndrivers have a output level control block like those included with the line output drivers, allowing gain adjustment \nup to +9dB on the output signal. As in the previous case, this output level adjustment is not intended to be used \nas a standard volume control, but instead is included for additional fullscale output signal level control.\nTwo of the output drivers, HPROUT and HPLOUT, include a direct connection path for the stereo DAC outputs \nto be passed directly to the output drivers and bypass the analog volume controls and mixing networks, using \nthe DAC_L2/R2 path. As in the line output case, this functionality provides the highest quality DAC playback \nperformance with reduced power dissipation, but can only be utilized if the DAC output does not need to route to \nmultiple output drivers simultaneously, and if mixing of the DAC output with other analog signals is not needed.\nVolume□0dB□to\n+9dB,□mute\nVolume□0dB□to\n+9dB,□mute VCM\nVolume□0dB□to\n+9dB,□muteVolume□0dB\nto□+9dB,\nmuteVCMHPLOUT\nHPLCOM\nHPROUTHPRCOMDAC_L2LINE2L\nLINE2R\nPGA_L\nDAC_L1\nDAC_R1VOLUME\nCONTROLS,\nMIXINGPGA_R\nDAC_R2LINE2L\nLINE2R\nPGA_L\nDAC_L1\nDAC_R1VOLUME\nCONTROLS,\nMIXINGPGA_R\nLINE2L\nLINE2R\nPGA_L\nDAC_L1\nDAC_R1VOLUME\nCONTROLS,\nMIXINGPGA_R\nLINE2L\nLINE2R\nPGA_L\nDAC_L1\nDAC_R1VOLUME\nCONTROLS,\nMIXINGPGA_R\nFigure 10-16. Architecture of the Output Stage Leading to the High Power Output Drivers\nThe high power output drivers include additional circuitry to avoid artifacts on the audio output during power-on \nand power-off transient conditions. The user should first program the type of output configuration being used \nin Page-0/Reg-14, to allow the device to select the optimal power-up scheme to avoid output artifacts. The \npower-up delay time for the high power output drivers is also programmable over a wide range of time delays, \nfrom instantaneous up to 4-sec, using Page-0/Reg-42.\nWhen these output drivers are powered down, they can be placed into a variety of output conditions based \non register programming. If lowest power operation is desired, then the outputs can be placed into a 3-state www.ti.comTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 35\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\ncondition, and all power to the output stage is removed. However, this generally results in the output nodes \ndrifting to rest near the upper or lower analog supply, due to small leakage currents at the pins. This then results \nin a longer delay requirement to avoid output artifacts during driver power-on. In order to reduce this required \npower-on delay, the TLV320AIC3106 includes an option for the output pins of the drivers to be weakly driven \nto the VCM level they would normally rest at when powered with no signal applied. This output VCM level \nis determined by an internal bandgap voltage reference, and thus results in extra power dissipation when the \ndrivers are in powerdown. However, this option provides the fastest method for transitioning the drivers from \npowerdown to full power operation without any output artifact introduced.\nThe device includes a further option that falls between the other two – while it requires less power drawn while \nthe output drivers are in powerdown, it also takes a slightly longer delay to power-up without artifact than if the \nbandgap reference is kept alive. In this alternate mode, the powered-down output driver pin is weakly driven to \na voltage of approximately half the DRVDD1/2 supply level using an internal voltage divider. This voltage will not \nmatch the actual VCM of a fully powered driver, but due to the output voltage being close to its final value, a \nmuch shorter power-up delay time setting can be used and still avoid any audible output artifacts. These output \nvoltage options are controlled in Page-0/Reg-42.\nThe high power output drivers can also be programmed to power up first with the output level control in a \nhighly attenuated state, then the output driver will automatically slowly reduce the output attenuation to reach \nthe desired output level setting programmed. This capability is enabled by default but can be enabled in Page-0/\nReg-40.\n10.3.7 Input Impedance and VCM Control\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes several programmable settings to control analog input pins, particularly when they \nare not selected for connection to an ADC PGA. The default option allows unselected inputs to be put into a \n3-state condition, such that the input impedance seen looking into the device is extremely high. Note, however, \nthat the pins on the device do include protection diode circuits connected to AVDD and AVSS. Thus, if any \nvoltage is driven onto a pin approximately one diode drop (~0.6 V) above AVDD or one diode drop below AVSS, \nthese protection diodes will begin conducting current, resulting in an effective impedance that no longer appears \nas a 3-state condition.\nAnother programmable option for unselected analog inputs is to weakly hold them at the common-mode input \nvoltage of the ADC PGA (which is determined by an internal bandgap voltage reference). This is useful to keep \nthe ac-coupling capacitors connected to analog inputs biased up at a normal DC level, thus avoiding the need \nfor them to charge up suddenly when the input is changed from being unselected to selected for connection to \nan ADC PGA. This option is controlled in Page-0/Reg-20 and 23. The user should ensure this option is disabled \nwhen an input is selected for connection to an ADC PGA or selected for the analog input bypass path, since it \ncan corrupt the recorded input signal if left operational when an input is selected.\nIn most cases, the analog input pins on the TLV320AIC3106 should be ac-coupled to analog input sources, the \nonly exception to this generally being if an ADC is being used for DC voltage measurement. The ac-coupling \ncapacitor will cause a highpass filter pole to be inserted into the analog signal path, so the size of the capacitor \nmust be chosen to move that filter pole sufficiently low in frequency to cause minimal effect on the processed \nanalog signal. The input impedance of the analog inputs when selected for connection to an ADC PGA varies \nwith the setting of the input level control, starting at approximately 20 k Ω with an input level control setting of \n0-dB, and increasing to approximately 80-k Ω when the input level control is set at –12 dB. For example, using \na 0.1 μF ac-coupling capacitor at an analog input results in a highpass filter pole of 80 Hz when the 0 dB input \nlevel control setting is selected.\n10.3.8 General-Purpose I/O\nTLV320AIC3106 has two dedicated pins for general-purpose I/O. These pins can be used to read status of \nexternal signals through register read when configured as general-purpose input. When configured as general-\npurpose output , these pins can also drive logic high or low. Besides these standard GPIO functions, these \npins can also be used in a variety of ways, such as output for internal clocks and interrupt signals. The \nTLV320AIC3106 generates a variety of interrupts of use to the host processor such interrupts on jack detection, \nbutton press, short-circuit detection, and AGC noise detection. All these interrupts can be routed individually \nto the GPIO pins or can be combined by a logical OR. In case of a combined interrupt, the user can read an TLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n36 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\ninternal status register to find the actual cause of interrupt. When configured as interrupt, the TLV320AIC3106 \nalso offers the flexibility of generating a single pulse or a train of pulses until the interrupt status register is read \nby the user.\n10.3.9 Digital Microphone Connectivity\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes support for connection of a digital microphone to the device by routing the digital \nsignal directly into the ADC digital decimation filter, where it is filtered, downsampled, and provided to the host \nprocessor over the audio data serial bus.\nWhen digital microphone mode is enabled, the TLV320AIC3106 provides an oversampling clock output for use \nby the digital microphone to transmit its data. The TLV320AIC3106 includes the capability to latch the data on \neither the rising, falling, or both edges of this supplied clock, enabling support for stereo digital microphones.\nIn this mode, the oversampling ratio of the digital mic modulator can be programmed as 128, 64 or 32 times \nthe ADC sample rate, ADCFS. The GPIO1 pin will output the serial oversampling clock at the programmed \nrate. TLV320AIC3106 latches the data input on GPIO2 as the Left and Right channel digital microphone data. \nFor the Left channel input, GPIO2 will be sampled on the rising edge of the clock, and for the Right channel \ninput, GPIO2 will be sampled on the falling edge of the clock. If a single digital mic channel is needed then the \ncorresponding ADC channel should be powered up, and the unused channel should be powered down. When \ndigital microphone mode is enabled, neither ADC can be used for digitizing analog inputs.\nConfiguring the digital microphone configuration set up is done by writing to Page 0, Register 107, bits D5-D4, \nand Register 25, bits D5-D4.\n10.3.10 Micbias Generation\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes a programmable microphone bias output voltage (MICBIAS), capable of providing \noutput voltages of 2.0 V or 2.5 V (both derived from the on-chip bandgap voltage) with 4-mA output current drive. \nIn addition, the MICBIAS may be programmed to be switched to AVDD directly through an on-chip switch, or it \ncan be powered down completely when not needed, for power savings. This function is controlled by register \nprogramming in Page-0/Reg-25.\n10.3.11 Short Circuit Output Protection\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes programmable short-circuit protection for the high power output drivers, for \nmaximum flexibility in a given application. By default, if these output drivers are shorted, they will automatically \nlimit the maximum amount of current that can be sourced to or sunk from a load, thereby protecting the device \nfrom an over-current condition. In this mode, the user can read Page-0/Reg-95 to determine whether the part \nis in short-circuit protection or not, and then decide whether to program the device to power down the output \ndrivers. However, the device includes further capability to automatically power down an output driver whenever \nit does into short-circuit protection, without requiring intervention from the user. In this case, the output driver will \nstay in a power down condition until the user specifically programs it to power down and then power back up \nagain, to clear the short-circuit flag.\n10.3.12 Jack/Headset Detection\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes extensive capability to monitor a headphone, microphone, or headset jack, \ndetermine if a plug has been inserted into the jack, and then determine what type of headset/headphone is wired \nto the plug. Figure 10-17  shows one configuration of the device that enables detection and determination of \nheadset type when a pseudo-differential (capless) stereo headphone output configuration is used. The registers \nused for this function are page 0, registers 14, 96, 97, and 13. The type of headset detected can be read back \nfrom page 0, register 13. Note that for best results, it is recommended to select a MICBIAS value as high as \npossible, and to program the output driver common-mode level at a 1.35-V or 1.5-V level.www.ti.comTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 37\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nMICBIAS\nMIC3(L/R)\nHPLOUT\nHPROUT\nTo\ndetection\nblockHPRCOM\nHPLCOM\n1.35MICDETTo Detection blocks\ns g m\ns g m ss g Stereo\nCellular\nStereo +\nCellular\nm = mic\ns = earspeaker\ng = ground/midbiasAVDDFigure 10-17.

In some cases, only a few \nfeatures of the device are required. For these applications, the unused stages of the device must be powered \ndown to save power and an alternate route should be used. This is called a bypass path. The bypass path \nmodes let the device to save power by turning off unused stages, like ADC, DAC and PGA.\n10.4.1.1 Analog Input Bypass Path Functionality\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes the additional ability to route some analog input signals past the integrated data \nconverters, for mixing with other analog signals and then direct connection to the output drivers. This capability is \nuseful in a cellphone, for example, when a separate FM radio device provides a stereo analog output signal that \nneeds to be routed to headphones. The TLV320AIC3106 supports this in a low power mode by providing a direct \nanalog path through the device to the output drivers, while all ADCs and DACs can be completely powered down \nto save power.\nFor fully-differential inputs, the TLV320AIC3106 provides the ability to pass the signals LINE2LP-LINE2LM and \nLINE2RP-LINE2RM to the output stage directly. If in single-ended configuration, the device can pass the signal \nLINE2LP and LINE2RP to the output stage directly.\n10.4.1.2 ADC PGA Signal Bypass Path Functionality\nIn addition to the input bypass path described above, the TLV320AIC3106 also includes the ability to route the \nADC PGA output signals past the ADC, for mixing with other analog signals and then direct connection to the \noutput drivers. These bypass functions are described in more detail in the sections on output mixing and output \ndriver configurations.\n10.4.1.3 Passive Analog Bypass During Powerdown\nProgramming the TLV320AIC3106 to Passive Analog bypass occurs by configuring the output stage switches for \npass through.

For SPI, SELECT should be tied high; for I2C, SELECT should be tied low. It is not \nrecommended to change the state of SELECT during device operation.\n10.5.1.1 SPI Control Mode\nRA(6) RA(5) RA(0) D(7) D(6) D(0)\n7-bit□Register Address Write 8-bit□Register□DataSS\nSCLK\nMOSI\nMISOHi-Z Hi-Z\nHi-Z Hi-Z\nFigure 10-22.

SPI Read\nIn the SPI control mode, the TLV320AIC3106 uses the pins MFP0=SSB, MFP1=SCLK, MFP2=MISO, \nMFP3=MOSI as a standard SPI port with clock polarity setting of 0 (typical microprocessor SPI control bit CPOL \n= 0). The SPI port allows full-duplex, synchronous, serial communication between a host processor (the master) \nand peripheral devices (slaves). The SPI master (in this case, the host processor) generates the synchronizing \nclock (driven onto SCLK) and initiates transmissions. The SPI slave devices (such as the TLV320AIC3106) \ndepend on a master to start and synchronize transmissions.\nA transmission begins when initiated by an SPI master. The byte from the SPI master begins shifting in on the \nslave MOSI pin under the control of the master serial clock (driven onto SCLK). As the byte shifts in on the MOSI \npin, a byte shifts out on the MISO pin to the master shift register.\nThe TLV320AIC3106 interface is designed so that with a clock phase bit setting of 1 (typical microprocessor SPI \ncontrol bit CPHA = 1), the master begins driving its MOSI pin and the slave begins driving its MISO pin on the \nfirst serial clock edge. The SSB pin can remain low between transmissions; however, the TLV320AIC3106 only \ninterprets the first 8 bits transmitted after the falling edge of SSB as a command byte, and the next 8 bits as a \ndata byte only if writing to a register. Reserved register bits should be written to their default values.TLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n42 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\n10.5.1.1.1 SPI Communication Protocol\nThe TLV320AIC3106 is entirely controlled by registers. Reading and writing these registers is accomplished by \nthe use of an 8-bit command, which is sent to the MOSI pin of the part prior to the data for that register. The \ncommand is constructed as shown in Table 10-6 . The first 7 bits specify the register address which is being \nwritten or read, from 0 to 127 (decimal). The command word ends with an R/W bit, which specifies the direction \nof data flow on the serial bus. In the case of a register write, the R/W bit should be set to 0. A second byte of \ndata is sent to the MOSI pin and contains the data to be written to the register.\nReading of registers is accomplished in similar fashion. The 8-bit command word sends the 7-bit register \naddress, followed by R/W bit = 1 to signify a register read is occurring,. The 8-bit register data is then clocked \nout of the part on the MISO pin during the second 8 SCLK clocks in the frame.\nTable 10-6. Command Word\nBit 7 Bit 6 Bit 5 Bit 4 Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0\nADDR6 ADDR5 ADDR4 ADDR3 ADDR2 ADDR1 ADDR0 R/ W\n10.5.1.1.2 Limitation on Register Writing\nWhen writing registers in SPI mode related to the audio output drivers mux, mix, gain configuration, etc., do not \nuse the auto-increment mode. In addition, between two successive writes to these registers, the host should \nkeep MFP0 (SPI chip select) high for at least 6.25us, to ensure that the register writes have occurred properly.\n10.5.1.1.3 Continuous Read / Write Operation\nThe TLV320AIC3106 includes the ability to read/write registers continuously, without needing to provide an \naddress for every register accessed. In SPI mode, a continuous write is executed by transitioning MFP0 (SPI \nchip select) low to start the frame, sending the first 8-bit command word to read/write a particular register, \nand then sending multiple bytes of register data, intended for the addressed register and those following. A \ncontinuous read is done similarly, with multiple bytes read in from the addressed register and the following \nregisters on the page. When the MFP0 (SPI chip select) pin is transitioned high again, the frame ends, as does \nthe continuous read/write operation. A new frame must begin again with a new command word, to start the next \nbus transaction.\nNote that this continuous read/write operation does not continue past a page boundary. The user should not \nattempt to read/write past the end of a page, since this may result in undesirable operation.\n10.5.1.2 I2C Control Interface\nThe TLV320AIC3106 supports the I2C control protocol when the SELECT pin is tied low, using 7-bit addressing \nand capable of both standard and fast modes. For I2C fast mode, note that the minimum timing for each of \ntHD-STA , tSU-STA , and t SU-STO  is 0.9 us, as seen in Figure 10-24 . When in I2C control mode, the TLV320AIC3106 \ncan be configured for one of four different addresses, using the multifunction pins MFP0 and MFP1, which \ncontrol the two LSBs of the device address. The 5 MSBs of the device address are fixed as 00110 and cannot be \nchanged, while the two LSBs are given by MFP1:MFP0. This results in four possible device addresses:www.ti.comTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 43\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nTable 10-7.

I2C Interface Timing\nI2C is a two-wire, open-drain interface supporting multiple devices and masters on a single bus. Devices on \nthe I2C bus only drive the bus lines LOW by connecting them to ground; they never drive the bus lines HIGH. \nInstead, the bus wires are pulled HIGH by pull-up resistors, so the bus wires are HIGH when no device is driving \nthem LOW. This way, two devices cannot conflict; if two devices drive the bus simultaneously, there is no driver \ncontention.\nCommunication on the I2C bus always takes place between two devices, one acting as the master and the other \nacting as the slave. Both masters and slaves can read and write, but slaves can only do so under the direction \nof the master. Some I2C devices can act as masters or slaves, but the TLV320AIC3106 can only act as a slave \ndevice.\nAn I2C bus consists of two lines, SDA and SCL. SDA carries data; SCL provides the clock. All data is transmitted \nacross the I2C bus in groups of eight bits. To send a bit on the I2C bus, the SDA line is driven to the appropriate \nlevel while SCL is LOW (a LOW on SDA indicates the bit is zero; a HIGH indicates the bit is one). Once the \nSDA line has settled, the SCL line is brought HIGH, then LOW. This pulse on SCL clocks the SDA bit into the \nreceivers shift register.\nThe I2C bus is bidirectional: the SDA line is used both for transmitting and receiving data. When a master reads \nfrom a slave, the slave drives the data line; when a master sends to a slave, the master drives the data line. \nUnder normal circumstances the master drives the clock line.\nMost of the time the bus is idle, no communication is taking place, and both lines are HIGH. When \ncommunication is taking place, the bus is active. Only master devices can start a communication. They do \nthis by causing a START condition on the bus. Normally, the data line is only allowed to change state while the \nclock line is LOW. If the data line changes state while the clock line is HIGH, it is either a START condition or its \ncounterpart, a STOP condition. A START condition is when the clock line is HIGH and the data line goes from \nHIGH to LOW. A STOP condition is when the clock line is HIGH and the data line goes from LOW to HIGH.\nAfter the master issues a START condition, it sends a byte that indicates which slave device it wants to \ncommunicate with. This byte is called the address byte. Each device on an I2C bus has a unique 7-bit address \nto which it responds. (Slaves can also have 10-bit addresses; see the I2C specification for details.) The master TLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n44 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\nsends an address in the address byte, together with a bit that indicates whether it wishes to read from or write to \nthe slave device.\nEvery byte transmitted on the I2C bus, whether it is address or data, is acknowledged with an acknowledge bit. \nWhen a master has finished sending a byte (eight data bits) to a slave, it stops driving SDA and waits for the \nslave to acknowledge the byte. The slave acknowledges the byte by pulling SDA LOW. The master then sends a \nclock pulse to clock the acknowledge bit. Similarly, when a master has finished reading a byte, it pulls SDA LOW \nto acknowledge this to the slave. It then sends a clock pulse to clock the bit.\nA not-acknowledge is performed by simply leaving SDA HIGH during an acknowledge cycle. If a device is not \npresent on the bus, and the master attempts to address it, it will receive a not −acknowledge because no device \nis present at that address to pull the line LOW.\nWhen a master has finished communicating with a slave, it may issue a STOP condition. When a STOP \ncondition is issued, the bus becomes idle again. A master may also issue another START condition. When a \nSTART condition is issued while the bus is active, it is called a repeated START condition.\nThe TLV320AIC3106 also responds to and acknowledges a General Call, which consists of the master issuing a \ncommand with a slave address byte of 00H.\nDA(6) DA(0) RA(7) RA(0) D(7) D(0)\nStart\n(M)7-bit Device Address\n(M)Write\n(M)Slave\nAck\n(S)8-bit Register Address\n(M)Slave\nAck\n(S)8-bit Register Data\n(M)Stop\n(M)Slave\nAck\n(S)SDASCL\n(M) => SDA Controlled by Master\n(S) => SDA Controlled by Slave\nFigure 10-25.

I2C Read\nIn the case of an I2C register write, if the master does not issue a STOP condition, then the device enters \nauto-increment mode. So in the next eight clocks, the data on SDA is treated as data for the next incremental \nregister.\nSimilarly, in the case of an I2C register read, after the device has sent out the 8-bit data from the addressed \nregister, if the master issues an ACKNOWLEDGE, the slave takes over control of SDA bus and transmit for the \nnext 8 clocks the data of the next incremental register.\n10.5.1.2.1 I2C BUS Debug in a Glitched System\nOccasionally, some systems may encounter noise or glitches on the I2C bus. In the unlikely event that this \naffects bus performance, then it can be useful to use the I2C Debug register. This feature terminates the I2C bus \nerror allowing this I2C device and system to resume communications. The I2C bus error detector is enabled by \ndefault. The TLV320AIC3106 I2C error detector status can be read from Page 0, Register 107, bit D0. If desired, \nthe detector can be disabled by writing to Page 0, Register 107, bit D2.www.ti.comTLV320AIC3106\nSLAS509G – APRIL 2006 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 45\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3106\n10.6 Register Maps\nThe register map of the TLV320AIC3106 actually consists of multiple pages of registers, with each page \ncontaining 128 registers. The register at address zero on each page is used as a page-control register, and \nwriting to this register determines the active page for the device. All subsequent read/write operations will access \nthe page that is active at the time, unless a register write is performed to change the active page. Only two \npages of registers are implemented in this product, with the active page defaulting to page 0 upon device reset.\nFor example, at device reset, the active page defaults to page 0, and thus all register read/write operations for \naddresses 1 to 127 will access registers in page 0. If registers on page 1 must be accessed, the user must \nwrite the 8-bit sequence 0x01 to register 0, the page control register, to change the active page from page 0 to \npage 1. After this write, it is recommended the user also read back the page control register, to safely ensure \nthe change in page control has occurred properly. Future read/write operations to addresses 1 to 127 will now \naccess registers in page 1. When page 0 registers must be accessed again, the user writes the 8-bit sequence \n0x00 to register 0, the page control register, to change the active page back to page 0. After a recommended \nread of the page control register, all further read/write operations to addresses 1 to 127 will now access page 0 \nregisters again.\nThe control registers for the TLV320AIC3106 are described in detail below. All registers are 8 bit in width, with \nD7 referring to the most significant bit of each register, and D0 referring to the least significant bit.\nTable 10-8.

Writing a one to this \nbit sets Page-1 as the active page for following register accesses.

In addition, to \nenable completely independent mixing operations to be performed for each output driver, each analog signal \ncoming into the output stage may have up to seven separate volume controls. These volume controls all have \napproximately 0.5-dB step programmability over most of the gain range, with steps increasing slightly at the \nlowest attenuations. Table 10-53  lists the detailed gain versus programmed setting for this basic volume control.\nTable 10-53.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n11.1 Application Information\nThe TLV320AIC3106 is a highly integrated low-power stereo audio codec with integrated stereo headphone/line \namplifier, as well as multiple inputs and outputs that are programmable in single-ended or fully differential \nconfigurations. All the features of the TLV320AIC3106 are accessed by programmable registers. External \nprocessor with SPI or I2C protocol is required to control the device, the protocol is selectable with external pin \nconfiguration. It is good practice to perform a hardware reset after initial power up to ensure that all registers are \nin their default states. Extensive register-based power control is included, enabling stereo 48-kHz DAC playback \nas low as 14-mW from a 3.3-V analog supply, making it ideal for portable battery-powered audio and telephony \napplications.\n11.2 Typical Application\nAIC3106LINE2LP\nLINE2LM\nLINE1LP\nLINE1LM\nLINE1RP\nLINE1RMMIC3LMICBIAS\nAAVDD_DAC\nAVSS_DACDRVDD\nDRVSS\nPVDDDVSSIOVDDDRVDD\nDRVSSAVDD_ADC\nAVSS_ADC\nAD1.525−1.95VIOVDD\n(1.1−3.3V)LEFT_LOP LEFT_LOMRIGHT_ROP RIGHT_ROMHPROUTHPLCOM HPRCOMMICDETAAVDD\n(2.7V−3.6V)\nTLV320AIC3106\nStereo Speakers with Multiple Audio Processors\nMIC3R HPLOUT\nHEADSET_MIC\nHEADSET_GND\nHEADSET_SPKR_R\nHEADSET_SPKR_L\nAAVBAT\nPVSSDVDD\nEarjack mic\nand\nheadset\nspeakers\n(capless)Handset Mic\nAnalog Baseband /\nModemMONO_LOP\nMONO_LOM\nLINE2RP\nLINE2RMLine In /\nFMMultimedia\nProcessor\nDOUT\nMFP0BCLK\nDINMCLK\nGPIO1GPIO2SCL\nSDA\nWCLK\nMFP2\nMFP1RESET\nMFP3\nSELECTDBB /\nModemRp\nRpIOVDD I2C ADDRESS\nTPA2012D2 Class−D Spkr Amp1 kΩ\n1 kΩ0.47 µF\n0.47 µF\n0.47 µF\n0.47 µF2 kΩ\n560 Ω560 Ω560 Ω\n4700 pF4700 pF560 Ω1 µF 0.1 µF\n0.47 µF0.47 µF\n0.47 µF\n0.47 µF\n0.47 µF\n0.47 µF\n0.47 µF1 µF0.1 µF\n0.1 µF1 µF0.1 µF\n10 µF\n1 µF\n1 µF\n0.1 µF\n1 µF0.1 µF\n33 µF\nA0.1 µF\nFigure 11-1.

If it is necessary to deviate from the \nrecommended layout, visit the E2E forum to request a layout review.\nAs the TLV320AIC3106 can be controlled with I2C or SPI protocol, the selection pin of the device should be \nconnected properly.\nDetermining sample rate and Master clock frequency is required since powering up the device as all internal \ntiming is derived from the master clock. See the Audio Clock Generation  section in order to get more information \nof how to configure correctly the required clocks for the device.\nAs the TLV320AIC3106 is designed for low-power applications, when powered up, the device has several \nfeatures powered down. A correct routing of the TLV320AIC3106 signals is achieved by a correct setting of the \ndevice registers, powering up the required stages of the device and configuring the internal switches to follow a \ndesired route.\nFor more information of the device configuration and programming, see the TLV320AIC3106 technical \ndocuments section in ti.com ( http://www.ti.com/product/TLV320AIC3106/technicaldocuments ).\n11.2.3 Application Curves\n-90-80-70-60-50-40-30-20-100\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nHeadphone□Out□Power□-□mWTHD□-□Total□Harmonic□Distortion□-□dB3.6□VDD_CM□1.8_LDAC\n3.3□VDD_CM□1.65_RDAC\n3.6□VDD_CM□1.8_RDAC3.3□□VDD_CM1.65_LDAC2.7□□VDD_CM□1.35_LDAC\n2.7□VDD_CM□1.35_RDAC\nFigure 11-2.

However, in \nsome rare instances, unexpected conditions can be attributed to power supply sequencing. The following \nsequence provides the most robust operation.\nIOVDD should be powered up first. The analog supplies, which include AVDD and DRVDD, should be powered \nup second. The digital supply DVDD should be powered up last. Keep RESET  low until all supplies are stable. \nThe analog supplies should be greater than or equal to DVDD at all times.\nFigure 12-1. TLV320AIC3101 Power Supply Sequencing\nTable 12-1.

This is recommended to get better \nnoise immunity.\n13.2 Layout Examples\nFigure 13-1.
