All rights reserved.\nGeneral Description\nThe 256Mb SDRAM is a high-speed CMOS, dynamic random-access memory contain-\ning 268,435,456 bits. It is internally configured as a quad-bank DRAM with a synchro-\nnous interface (all signals are registered on the positive edge of the clock signal, CLK).\nEach of the x4’s 67,108,864-bit banks is organized as 8192 rows by 2048 columns by 4\nbits. Each of the x8’s 67,108,864-bit banks is organized as 8192 rows by 1024 columns by\n8 bits. Each of the x16’s 67,108,864-bit banks is organized as 8192 rows by 512 columns\nby 16 bits.\nRead and write accesses to the SDRAM are burst-oriented; accesses start at a selected\nlocation and continue for a programmed number of locations in a programmed se-\nquence. Accesses begin with the registration of an ACTIVE command, which is then fol-\nlowed by a READ or WRITE command. The address bits registered coincident with the\nACTIVE command are used to select the bank and row to be accessed (BA[1:0] select the\nbank; A[12:0] select the row). The address bits registered coincident with the READ or\nWRITE command are used to select the starting column location for the burst access.\nThe SDRAM provides for programmable read or write burst lengths (BL) of 1, 2, 4, or 8\nlocations, or the full page, with a burst terminate option. An auto precharge function\nmay be enabled to provide a self-timed row precharge that is initiated at the end of the\nburst sequence.\nThe 256Mb SDRAM uses an internal pipelined architecture to achieve high-speed oper-\nation. This architecture is compatible with the 2 n rule of prefetch architectures, but it\nalso allows the column address to be changed on every clock cycle to achieve a high-\nspeed, fully random access. Precharging one bank while accessing one of the other\nthree banks will hide the PRECHARGE cycles and provide seamless, high-speed, ran-\ndom-access operation.\nThe 256Mb SDRAM is designed to operate in 3.3V memory systems. An auto refresh\nmode is provided, along with a power-saving, power-down mode. All inputs and out-\nputs are LVTTL-compatible.\nSDRAMs offer substantial advances in DRAM operating performance, including the\nability to synchronously burst data at a high data rate with automatic column-address\ngeneration, the ability to interleave between internal banks to hide precharge time, and\nthe capability to randomly change column addresses on each clock cycle during a burst\naccess.\nAutomotive Temperature\nThe automotive temperature (AT) option adheres to the following specifications:\n• 16ms refresh rate\n• Self refresh not supported\n• Ambient and case temperature cannot be less than –40°C or greater than +105°C256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nGeneral Description\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

All SDRAM input signals are sampled on the positive\nedge of CLK. CLK also increments the internal burst counter and controls the output registers.\nCKE Input Clock enable: CKE activates (HIGH) and deactivates (LOW) the CLK signal. Deactivating the\nclock provides precharge power-down and SELF REFRESH operation (all banks idle), active\npower-down (row active in any bank), or CLOCK SUSPEND operation (burst/access in pro-\ngress). CKE is synchronous except after the device enters power-down and self refresh modes,\nwhere CKE becomes asynchronous until after exiting the same mode. The input buffers, in-\ncluding CLK, are disabled during power-down and self refresh modes, providing low standby\npower. CKE may be tied HIGH.\nCS# Input Chip select: CS# enables (registered LOW) and disables (registered HIGH) the command decod-\ner. All commands are masked when CS# is registered HIGH, but READ/WRITE bursts already in\nprogress will continue, and DQM operation will retain its DQ mask capability while CS# is\nHIGH. CS# provides for external bank selection on systems with multiple banks. CS# is consid-\nered part of the command code.\nCAS#, RAS#,\nWE#Input Command inputs: RAS#, CAS#, and WE# (along with CS#) define the command being entered.\nx4, x8:\nDQM\nx16:\nDQML, DQMH\nLDQM, UDQM\n(54-ball)Input Input/output mask: DQM is sampled HIGH and is an input mask signal for write accesses and\nan output enable signal for read accesses. Input data is masked during a WRITE cycle. The\noutput buffers are High-Z (two-clock latency) during a READ cycle. LDQM corresponds to\nDQ[7:0], and UDQM corresponds to DQ[15:8]. LDQM and UDQM are considered same-state\nwhen referenced as DQM.\nBA[1:0] Input Bank address input(s): BA[1:0] define to which bank the ACTIVE, READ, WRITE, or PRECHARGE\ncommand is being applied.\nA[12:0] Input Address inputs: A[12:0] are sampled during the ACTIVE command (row address A[12:0]) and\nREAD or WRITE command (column address A[9:0] and A11 for x4; A[9:0] for x8; A[8:0] for x16;\nwith A10 defining auto precharge) to select one location out of the memory array in the re-\nspective bank. A10 is sampled during a PRECHARGE command to determine if all banks are to\nbe precharged (A10 HIGH) or bank selected by BA[1:0] (LOW). The address inputs also provide\nthe op-code during a LOAD MODE REGISTER command.\nx16:\nDQ[15:0]I/O Data input/output: Data bus for x16 (pins 4, 7, 10, 13, 42, 45, 48, and 51 are NC for x8; and\npins 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 13, 42, 45, 47, 48, 51, and 53 are NC for x4).\nx8:\nDQ[7:0]I/O Data input/output: Data bus for x8 (pins 2, 8, 47, 53 are NC for x4).\nx4:\nDQ[3:0]I/O Data input/output: Data bus for x4.\nVDDQ Supply DQ power: DQ power to the die for improved noise immunity.\nVSSQ Supply DQ ground: DQ ground to the die for improved noise immunity.\nVDD Supply Power supply: +3.3V ±0.3V.\nVSS Supply Ground.\nNC – These should be left unconnected. For x4 and x8 parts, G1 is a no connect, but may be used as\nA12 in future designs.256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nPin and Ball Assignments and Descriptions\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

An important step in maintaining the prop-\ner junction temperature is using the device’s thermal impedances correctly. The ther-\nmal impedances are listed in Table 6 (page 20) for the applicable die revision and\npackages being made available. These thermal impedance values vary according to the\ndensity, package, and particular design used for each device.\nIncorrectly using thermal impedances can produce significant errors. Read Micron\ntechnical note TN-00-08, “Thermal Applications” prior to using the thermal impedan-\nces listed in Table 6 (page 20). To ensure the compatibility of current and future de-\nsigns, contact Micron Applications Engineering to confirm thermal impedance values.\nThe SDRAM device’s safe junction temperature range can be maintained when the T C\nspecification is not exceeded. In applications where the device’s ambient temperature\nis too high, use of forced air and/or heat sinks may be required to satisfy the case tem-\nperature specifications.\nTable 5: Temperature Limits\nParameter Symbol Min Max Unit Notes\nOperating case temperature Commercial TC 0 80 °C 1, 2, 3, 4\nIndustrial –40 90\nAutomotive –40 105\nJunction temperature Commercial TJ 0 85 °C 3\nIndustrial –40 95\nAutomotive –40 110\nAmbient temperature Commercial TA 0 70 °C 3, 5\nIndustrial –40 85\nAutomotive –40 105\nPeak reflow temperature TPEAK – 260 °C  \nNotes: 1. MAX operating case temperature, T C, is measured in the center of the package on the\ntop side of the device, as shown in Figure 11 (page 21), Figure 12 (page 21), and Fig-\nure 13 (page 22).\n2. Device functionality is not guaranteed if the device exceeds maximum T C during opera-\ntion.\n3. All temperature specifications must be satisfied.\n4. The case temperature should be measured by gluing a thermocouple to the top-center\nof the component. This should be done with a 1mm bead of conductive epoxy, as de-\nfined by the JEDEC EIA/JESD51 standards. Take care to ensure that the thermocouple\nbead is touching the case.\n5.

All signals are registered on the positive edge of the clock signal, CLK. Each of\nthe x4’s 67,108,864-bit banks is organized as 8192 rows by 2048 columns by 4 bits. Each\nof the x8’s 67,108,864-bit banks is organized as 8192 rows by 1024 columns by 8 bits.\nEach of the x16’s 67,108,864-bit banks is organized as 8192 rows by 512 columns by 16\nbits.\nRead and write accesses to the SDRAM are burst-oriented; accesses start at a selected\nlocation and continue for a programmed number of locations in a programmed se-\nquence. Accesses begin with the registration of an ACTIVE command, followed by a\nREAD or WRITE command. The address bits registered coincident with the ACTIVE\ncommand are used to select the bank and row to be accessed (BA0 and BA1 select the\nbank, A[12:0] select the row). The address bits (x4: A[9:0], A11; x8: A[9:0]; x16: A[8:0]) reg-\nistered coincident with the READ or WRITE command are used to select the starting\ncolumn location for the burst access.\nPrior to normal operation, the SDRAM must be initialized. The following sections pro-\nvide detailed information covering device initialization, register definition, command\ndescriptions, and device operation.256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nFunctional Description\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

Additional Truth Tables (Table 15 (page 37), Ta-\nble 16 (page 39), and Table 17 (page 41)) provide current state/next state informa-\ntion.\nTable 14: Truth Table – Commands and DQM Operation\nNote 1 applies to all parameters and conditions\nName (Function) CS# RAS# CAS# WE# DQM ADDR DQ Notes\nCOMMAND INHIBIT (NOP) H X X X X X X  \nNO OPERATION (NOP) L H H H X X X  \nACTIVE (select bank and activate row) L L H H X Bank/row X 2\nREAD (select bank and column, and start READ burst) L H L H L/H Bank/col X 3\nWRITE (select bank and column, and start WRITE burst) L H L L L/H Bank/col Valid 3\nBURST TERMINATE L H H L X X Active 4\nPRECHARGE (Deactivate row in bank or banks) L L H L X Code X 5\nAUTO REFRESH or SELF REFRESH (enter self refresh mode) L L L H X X X 6, 7\nLOAD MODE REGISTER L L L L X Op-code X 8\nWrite enable/output enable X X X X L X Active 9\nWrite inhibit/output High-Z X X X X H X High-Z 9\nNotes: 1. CKE is HIGH for all commands shown except SELF REFRESH.\n2. A[0 :n] provide row address (where A n is the most significant address bit), BA0 and BA1\ndetermine which bank is made active.\n3. A[0 :i] provide column address (where i = the most significant column address for a given\ndevice configuration). A10 HIGH enables the auto precharge feature (nonpersistent),\nwhile A10 LOW disables the auto precharge feature. BA0 and BA1 determine which\nbank is being read from or written to.\n4. The purpose of the BURST TERMINATE command is to stop a data burst, thus the com-\nmand could coincide with data on the bus. However, the DQ column reads a “Don’t\nCare” state to illustrate that the BURST TERMINATE command can occur when there is\nno data present.\n5. A10 LOW: BA0, BA1 determine the bank being precharged. A10 HIGH: all banks pre-\ncharged and BA0, BA1 are “Don’t Care.”\n6. This command is AUTO REFRESH if CKE is HIGH, SELF REFRESH if CKE is LOW.\n7. Internal refresh counter controls row addressing; all inputs and I/Os are “Don’t Care” ex-\ncept for CKE.\n8. A[11:0] define the op-code written to the mode register.\n9. Activates or deactivates the DQ during WRITEs (zero-clock delay) and READs (two-clock\ndelay).\nCOMMAND INHIBIT\nThe COMMAND INHIBIT function prevents new commands from being executed by\nthe device, regardless of whether the CLK signal is enabled. The device is effectively de-\nselected. Operations already in progress are not affected.256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nCommands\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nNO OPERATION (NOP)\nThe NO OPERATION (NOP) command is used to perform a NOP to the selected device\n(CS# is LOW). This prevents unwanted commands from being registered during idle or\nwait states. Operations already in progress are not affected.\nLOAD MODE REGISTER (LMR)\nThe mode registers are loaded via inputs A[ n:0]  (where A n is the most significant ad-\ndress term), BA0, and BA1(see Mode Register (page 44)). The LOAD MODE REGISTER\ncommand can only be issued when all banks are idle and a subsequent executable com-\nmand cannot be issued until tMRD is met.\nACTIVE\nThe ACTIVE command is used to activate a row in a particular bank for a subsequent\naccess. The value on the BA0, BA1 inputs selects the bank, and the address provided se-\nlects the row. This row remains active for accesses until a PRECHARGE command is is-\nsued to that bank. A PRECHARGE command must be issued before opening a different\nrow in the same bank.\nFigure 14: ACTIVE Command\nCS#\nWE#CAS#RAS#CKECLK\nAddress Row address\nDon’t CareHIGH\nBA0, BA1 Bank address256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nCommands\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

The values\non the BA0 and BA1 inputs select the bank; the address provided selects the starting col-\numn location. The value on input A10 determines whether auto precharge is used. If au-\nto precharge is selected, the row being accessed is precharged at the end of the READ\nburst; if auto precharge is not selected, the row remains open for subsequent accesses.\nRead data appears on the DQ subject to the logic level on the DQM inputs two clocks\nearlier.

The bank(s) will be available for a subsequent row access a\nspecified time (tRP) after the PRECHARGE command is issued. Input A10 determines\nwhether one or all banks are to be precharged, and in the case where only one bank is\nprecharged, inputs BA0 and BA1 select the bank. Otherwise BA0 and BA1 are treated as\n“Don’t Care.” After a bank has been precharged, it is in the idle state and must be acti-\nvated prior to any READ or WRITE commands are issued to that bank.\nFigure 17: PRECHARGE Command\nCS#\nWE#CAS#RAS#CKECLK\nA10\nDon’t CareHIGH\nAll banks\nBank selectedAddress\nBA0, BA1 Bank address\nValid address\nBURST TERMINATE\nThe BURST TERMINATE command is used to truncate either fixed-length or continu-\nous page bursts.

All rights reserved.\nREFRESH\nAUTO REFRESH\nAUTO REFRESH is used during normal operation of the SDRAM and is analogous to\nCAS#-BEFORE-RAS# (CBR) refresh in conventional DRAMs. This command is nonper-\nsistent, so it must be issued each time a refresh is required. All active banks must be pre-\ncharged prior to issuing an AUTO REFRESH command. The AUTO REFRESH command\nshould not be issued until the minimum tRP has been met after the PRECHARGE com-\nmand, as shown in Bank/Row Activation (page 49).\nThe addressing is generated by the internal refresh controller. This makes the address\nbits a “Don’t Care” during an AUTO REFRESH command. Regardless of device width,\nthe 256Mb SDRAM requires 8192 AUTO REFRESH cycles every 64ms (commercial and\nindustrial) or 16ms (automotive). Providing a distributed AUTO REFRESH command\nevery 7.813 μs (commercial and industrial) or 1.953 μs (automotive) will meet the refresh\nrequirement and ensure that each row is refreshed. Alternatively, 8192 AUTO REFRESH\ncommands can be issued in a burst at the minimum cycle rate (tRFC), once every 64ms\n(commercial and industrial) or 16ms (automotive).\nSELF REFRESH\nThe SELF REFRESH command can be used to retain data in the SDRAM, even if the rest\nof the system is powered-down. When in the self refresh mode, the SDRAM retains data\nwithout external clocking.\nThe SELF REFRESH command is initiated like an AUTO REFRESH command except\nCKE is disabled (LOW). After the SELF REFRESH command is registered, all the inputs\nto the SDRAM become a “Don’t Care” with the exception of CKE, which must remain\nLOW.\nAfter self refresh mode is engaged, the SDRAM provides its own internal clocking, caus-\ning it to perform its own AUTO REFRESH cycles. The SDRAM must remain in self re-\nfresh mode for a minimum period equal to tRAS and may remain in self refresh mode\nfor an indefinite period beyond that.\nThe procedure for exiting self refresh requires a sequence of commands. First, CLK\nmust be stable (stable clock is defined as a signal cycling within timing constraints\nspecified for the clock pin) prior to CKE going back HIGH. After CKE is HIGH, the\nSDRAM must have NOP commands issued (a minimum of two clocks) for tXSR because\ntime is required for the completion of any internal refresh in progress.\nUpon exiting the self refresh mode, AUTO REFRESH commands must be issued at the\nspecified intervals, as both SELF REFRESH and AUTO REFRESH utilize the row refresh\ncounter.\nSelf refresh is not supported on automotive temperature devices.256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nCommands\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nInitialization\nSDRAM must be powered up and initialized in a predefined manner. Operational proce-\ndures other than those specified may result in undefined operation. After power is ap-\nplied to V DD and V DDQ  (simultaneously) and the clock is stable (stable clock is defined\nas a signal cycling within timing constraints specified for the clock pin), the SDRAM re-\nquires a 100 μs delay prior to issuing any command other than a COMMAND INHIBIT or\nNOP . Starting at some point during this 100 μs period and continuing at least through\nthe end of this period, COMMAND INHIBIT or NOP commands must be applied.\nAfter the 100 μs delay has been satisfied with at least one COMMAND INHIBIT or NOP\ncommand having been applied, a PRECHARGE command should be applied. All banks\nmust then be precharged, thereby placing the device in the all banks idle state.\nOnce in the idle state, at least two AUTO REFRESH cycles must be performed. After the\nAUTO REFRESH cycles are complete, the SDRAM is ready for mode register program-\nming. Because the mode register will power up in an unknown state, it must be loaded\nprior to applying any operational command. If desired, the two AUTO REFRESH com-\nmands can be issued after the LMR command.\nThe recommended power-up sequence for SDRAM:\n1. Simultaneously apply power to V DD and V DDQ .\n2. Assert and hold CKE at a LVTTL logic LOW since all inputs and outputs are LVTTL-\ncompatible.\n3. Provide stable CLOCK signal. Stable clock is defined as a signal cycling within tim-\ning constraints specified for the clock pin.\n4. Wait at least 100 μs prior to issuing any command other than a COMMAND INHIB-\nIT or NOP .\n5. Starting at some point during this 100 μs period, bring CKE HIGH. Continuing at\nleast through the end of this period, 1 or more COMMAND INHIBIT or NOP com-\nmands must be applied.\n6. Perform a PRECHARGE ALL command.\n7. Wait at least tRP time; during this time NOPs or DESELECT commands must be\ngiven. All banks will complete their precharge, thereby placing the device in the all\nbanks idle state.\n8. Issue an AUTO REFRESH command.\n9. Wait at least tRFC time, during which only NOPs or COMMAND INHIBIT com-\nmands are allowed.\n10. Issue an AUTO REFRESH command.\n11. Wait at least tRFC time, during which only NOPs or COMMAND INHIBIT com-\nmands are allowed.\n12. The SDRAM is now ready for mode register programming. Because the mode reg-\nister will power up in an unknown state, it should be loaded with desired bit values\nprior to applying any operational command. Using the LMR command, program\nthe mode register. The mode register is programmed via the MODE REGISTER SET\ncommand with BA1 = 0, BA0 = 0 and retains the stored information until it is pro-\ngrammed again or the device loses power. Not programming the mode register\nupon initialization will result in default settings which may not be desired. Out-\nputs are guaranteed High-Z after the LMR command is issued. Outputs should be\nHigh-Z already before the LMR command is issued.\n13. Wait at least tMRD time, during which only NOP or DESELECT commands are al-\nlowed.\nAt this point the DRAM is ready for any valid command.256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nInitialization\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

The mode register\nis programmed via the LOAD MODE REGISTER command and retains the stored infor-\nmation until it is programmed again or the device loses power.\nMode register bits M[2:0] specify the BL; M3 specifies the type of burst; M[6:4] specify\nthe CL; M7 and M8 specify the operating mode; M9 specifies the write burst mode; and\nM10–M n should be set to zero to ensure compatibility with future revisions. M n + 1 and\nMn + 2 should be set to zero to select the mode register.\nThe mode registers must be loaded when all banks are idle, and the controller must wait\ntMRD before initiating the subsequent operation. Violating either of these requirements\nwill result in unspecified operation.256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nMode Register\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

The burst length determines the maximum number of column loca-\ntions that can be accessed for a given READ or WRITE command. Burst lengths of 1, 2,\n4, 8, or continuous locations are available for both the sequential and the interleaved\nburst types, and a continuous page burst is available for the sequential type. The con-\ntinuous page burst is used in conjunction with the BURST TERMINATE command to\ngenerate arbitrary burst lengths.\nReserved states should not be used, as unknown operation or incompatibility with fu-\nture versions may result.\nWhen a READ or WRITE command is issued, a block of columns equal to the burst\nlength is effectively selected. All accesses for that burst take place within this block,\nmeaning that the burst wraps within the block when a boundary is reached. The block\nis uniquely selected by A[8:1] when BL = 2, A[8:2] when BL = 4, and A[8:3] when BL = 8.\nThe remaining (least significant) address bit(s) is (are) used to select the starting loca-\ntion within the block. Continuous page bursts wrap within the page when the boundary\nis reached.\nBurst Type\nAccesses within a given burst can be programmed to be either sequential or interleaved;\nthis is referred to as the burst type and is selected via bit M3.\nThe ordering of accesses within a burst is determined by the burst length, the burst\ntype, and the starting column address.256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nMode Register\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

For example, assuming that the clock cycle time is\nsuch that all relevant access times are met, if a READ command is registered at T0 and\nthe latency is programmed to two clocks, the DQ start driving after T1 and the data is\nvalid by T2.\nReserved states should not be used as unknown operation or incompatibility with fu-\nture versions may result.\nFigure 20: CAS Latency\nCLK\nDQT2 T1 T3 T0\nCL = 3 tLZ\nDOUTtOHCommand NOP READ NOPT4\nNOP\nDon’t Care UndefinedCLK\nDQT2 T1 T3 T0\nCL = 2 tLZ\nDOUTtOHCommand NOP READ\ntAC\ntACNOP\nOperating Mode\nThe normal operating mode is selected by setting M7 and M8 to zero; the other combi-\nnations of values for M7 and M8 are reserved for future use.

All rights reserved.\nBank/Row Activation\nBefore any READ or WRITE commands can be issued to a bank within the SDRAM, a\nrow in that bank must be opened. This is accomplished via the ACTIVE command,\nwhich selects both the bank and the row to be activated.\nAfter a row is opened with the ACTIVE command, a READ or WRITE command can be\nissued to that row, subject to the tRCD specification. tRCD (MIN) should be divided by\nthe clock period and rounded up to the next whole number to determine the earliest\nclock edge after the ACTIVE command on which a READ or WRITE command can be\nentered. For example, a tRCD specification of 20ns with a 125 MHz clock (8ns period)\nresults in 2.5 clocks, rounded to 3. This is reflected in Figure 21 (page 49), which covers\nany case where 2 < tRCD (MIN)/tCK ≤ 3. (The same procedure is used to convert other\nspecification limits from time units to clock cycles.)\nA subsequent ACTIVE command to a different row in the same bank can only be issued\nafter the previous active row has been precharged. The minimum time interval between\nsuccessive ACTIVE commands to the same bank is defined by tRC.\nA subsequent ACTIVE command to another bank can be issued while the first bank is\nbeing accessed, which results in a reduction of total row-access overhead. The mini-\nmum time interval between successive ACTIVE commands to different banks is defined\nby tRRD.\nFigure 21: Example: Meeting tRCD (MIN) When 2 < tRCD (MIN)/tCK < 3\n \nCLKT2 T1 T3 T0\ntCommand NOP ACTIVEREAD or \nWRITENOP\nRCD(MIN)tCKtCKtCK\nDon’t Care256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nBank/Row Activation\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

The\nstarting column and bank addresses are provided with the READ command, and auto\nprecharge is either enabled or disabled for that burst access. If auto precharge is ena-\nbled, the row being accessed is precharged at the completion of the burst. In the follow-\ning figures, auto precharge is disabled.\nDuring READ bursts, the valid data-out element from the starting column address is\navailable following the CAS latency after the READ command. Each subsequent data-\nout element will be valid by the next positive clock edge. Figure 23 (page 52) shows\ngeneral timing for each possible CAS latency setting.\nUpon completion of a burst, assuming no other commands have been initiated, the DQ\nsignals will go to High-Z. A continuous page burst continues until terminated. At the\nend of the page, it wraps to column 0 and continues.\nData from any READ burst can be truncated with a subsequent READ command, and\ndata from a fixed-length READ burst can be followed immediately by data from a READ\ncommand. In either case, a continuous flow of data can be maintained. The first data\nelement from the new burst either follows the last element of a completed burst or the\nlast desired data element of a longer burst that is being truncated. The new READ com-\nmand should be issued x cycles before the clock edge at which the last desired data ele-\nment is valid, where  x = CL - 1. This is shown in Figure 23 (page 52) for CL2 and CL3.\nSDRAM devices use a pipelined architecture and therefore do not require the 2 n rule as-\nsociated with a prefetch architecture. A READ command can be initiated on any clock\ncycle following a READ command. Full-speed random read accesses can be performed\nto the same bank, or each subsequent READ can be performed to a different bank.256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nREAD Operation\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

Each READ command can be issued to any bank. DQM is LOW.\nData from any READ burst can be truncated with a subsequent WRITE command, and\ndata from a fixed-length READ burst can be followed immediately by data from a\nWRITE command (subject to bus turnaround limitations). The WRITE burst can be ini-\ntiated on the clock edge immediately following the last (or last desired) data element\nfrom the READ burst, provided that I/O contention can be avoided. In a given system\ndesign, there is a possibility that the device driving the input data will go Low-Z before\nthe DQ go High-Z. In this case, at least a single-cycle delay should occur between the\nlast read data and the WRITE command.\nThe DQM input is used to avoid I/O contention, as shown in Figure 24 (page 53) and\nFigure 25 (page 54). The DQM signal must be asserted (HIGH) at least two clocks prior\nto the WRITE command (DQM latency is two clocks for output buffers) to suppress da-\nta-out from the READ. After the WRITE command is registered, the DQ will go to High-Z\n(or remain High-Z), regardless of the state of the DQM signal, provided the DQM was\nactive on the clock just prior to the WRITE command that truncated the READ com-\nmand. If not, the second WRITE will be an invalid WRITE. For example, if DQM was\nLOW during T4, then the WRITEs at T5 and T7 would be valid, and the WRITE at T6\nwould be invalid.256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nREAD Operation\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nThe DQM signal must be de-asserted prior to the WRITE command (DQM latency is\nzero clocks for input buffers) to ensure that the written data is not masked. Figure 24\n(page 53) shows where, due to the clock cycle frequency, bus contention is avoided\nwithout having to add a NOP cycle, while Figure 25 (page 54) shows the case where an\nadditional NOP cycle is required.\nA fixed-length READ burst may be followed by or truncated with a PRECHARGE com-\nmand to the same bank, provided that auto precharge was not activated. The PRE-\nCHARGE command should be issued x cycles before the clock edge at which the last de-\nsired data element is valid, where x = CL - 1. This is shown in Figure 26 (page 54) for\neach possible CL; data element n + 3 is either the last of a burst of four or the last de-\nsired data element of a longer burst. Following the PRECHARGE command, a subse-\nquent command to the same bank cannot be issued until tRP is met. Note that part of\nthe row precharge time is hidden during the access of the last data element(s).\nIn the case of a fixed-length burst being executed to completion, a PRECHARGE com-\nmand issued at the optimum time (as described above) provides the same operation\nthat would result from the same fixed-length burst with auto precharge. The disadvant-\nage of the PRECHARGE command is that it requires that the command and address\nbuses be available at the appropriate time to issue the command. The advantage of the\nPRECHARGE command is that it can be used to truncate fixed-length or continuous\npage bursts.\nFigure 24: READ-to-WRITE\nREAD NOP NOP WRITE NOPCLKT2 T1 T4 T3 T0\nDQM\nDQCommand\n  Address Bank,\nCol b Bank,\nCol n\nDStHZtCK\nDon’t Care Transitioning datatDOUTDIN\nNote: 1.

All rights reserved.\nPRECHARGE Operation\nThe PRECHARGE command (see Figure 17 (page 35)) is used to deactivate the open row\nin a particular bank or the open row in all banks. The bank(s) will be available for a sub-\nsequent row access some specified time (tRP) after the PRECHARGE command is is-\nsued. Input A10 determines whether one or all banks are to be precharged, and in the\ncase where only one bank is to be precharged (A10 = LOW), inputs BA0 and BA1 select\nthe bank. When all banks are to be precharged (A10 = HIGH), inputs BA0 and BA1 are\ntreated as “Don’t Care.” After a bank has been precharged, it is in the idle state and\nmust be activated prior to any READ or WRITE commands being issued to that bank.\nAuto Precharge\nAuto precharge is a feature that performs the same individual-bank PRECHARGE func-\ntion described previously, without requiring an explicit command. This is accomplished\nby using A10 to enable auto precharge in conjunction with a specific READ or WRITE\ncommand. A precharge of the bank/row that is addressed with the READ or WRITE\ncommand is automatically performed upon completion of the READ or WRITE burst,\nexcept in the continuous page burst mode where auto precharge does not apply. In the\nspecific case of write burst mode set to single location access with burst length set to\ncontinuous, the burst length setting is the overriding setting and auto precharge does\nnot apply. Auto precharge is nonpersistent in that it is either enabled or disabled for\neach individual READ or WRITE command.\nAuto precharge ensures that the precharge is initiated at the earliest valid stage within a\nburst. Another command cannot be issued to the same bank until the precharge time\n(tRP) is completed. This is determined as if an explicit PRECHARGE command was is-\nsued at the earliest possible time, as described for each burst type in the Burst Type\n(page 46) section.\nMicron SDRAM supports concurrent auto precharge; cases of concurrent auto pre-\ncharge for READs and WRITEs are defined below.\nREAD with auto precharge interrupted by a READ (with or without auto precharge)\nA READ to bank m will interrupt a READ on bank n following the programmed CAS la-\ntency. The precharge to bank n begins when the READ to bank m is registered (see Fig-\nure 40 (page 68)).\nREAD with auto precharge interrupted by a WRITE (with or without auto precharge)\nA WRITE to bank m will interrupt a READ on bank n when registered. DQM should be\nused two clocks prior to the WRITE command to prevent bus contention. The pre-\ncharge to bank n begins when the WRITE to bank m is registered (see Figure 41\n(page 69)).\nWRITE with auto precharge interrupted by a READ (with or without auto precharge)\nA READ to bank m will interrupt a WRITE on bank n when registered, with the data-out\nappearing CL later. The precharge to bank n will begin after tWR is met, where tWR be-\ngins when the READ to bank m is registered. The last valid WRITE to bank n will be da-\nta-in registered one clock prior to the READ to bank m (see Figure 46 (page 74)).\nWRITE with auto precharge interrupted by a WRITE (with or without auto precharge)\nA WRITE to bank m will interrupt a WRITE on bank n when registered.

All rights reserved.\nAUTO REFRESH Operation\nThe AUTO REFRESH command is used during normal operation of the device to refresh\nthe contents of the array. This command is nonpersistent, so it must be issued each\ntime a refresh is required. All active banks must be precharged prior to issuing an AUTO\nREFRESH command. The AUTO REFRESH command should not be issued until the\nminimum tRP is met following the PRECHARGE command. Addressing is generated by\nthe internal refresh controller. This makes the address bits “Don’t Care” during an AU-\nTO REFRESH command.\nAfter the AUTO REFRESH command is initiated, it must not be interrupted by any exe-\ncutable command until tRFC has been met. During tRFC time, COMMAND INHIBIT or\nNOP commands must be issued on each positive edge of the clock. The SDRAM re-\nquires that every row be refreshed each tREF period. Providing a distributed AUTO RE-\nFRESH command—calculated by dividing the refresh period (tREF) by the number of\nrows to be refreshed—meets the timing requirement and ensures that each row is re-\nfreshed. Alternatively, to satisfy the refresh requirement a burst refresh can be employed\nafter every tREF period by issuing consecutive AUTO REFRESH commands for the num-\nber of rows to be refreshed at the minimum cycle rate (tRFC).256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nAUTO REFRESH Operation\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nSELF REFRESH Operation\nThe self refresh mode can be used to retain data in the device, even when the rest of the\nsystem is powered down. When in self refresh mode, the device retains data without ex-\nternal clocking. The SELF REFRESH command is initiated like an AUTO REFRESH com-\nmand, except CKE is disabled (LOW). After the SELF REFRESH command is registered,\nall the inputs to the device become “Don’t Care” with the exception of CKE, which must\nremain LOW.\nAfter self refresh mode is engaged, the device provides its own internal clocking, ena-\nbling it to perform its own AUTO REFRESH cycles. The device must remain in self re-\nfresh mode for a minimum period equal to tRAS and remains in self refresh mode for an\nindefinite period beyond that.\nThe procedure for exiting self refresh requires a sequence of commands. First, CLK\nmust be stable prior to CKE going back HIGH. (Stable clock is defined as a signal cycling\nwithin timing constraints specified for the clock ball.) After CKE is HIGH, the device\nmust have NOP commands issued for a minimum of two clocks for tXSR because time is\nrequired for the completion of any internal refresh in progress.\nUpon exiting the self refresh mode, AUTO REFRESH commands must be issued accord-\ning to the distributed refresh rate (tREF/refresh row count) as both SELF REFRESH and\nAUTO REFRESH utilize the row refresh counter.256Mb: x4, x8, x16 SDRAM\nSELF REFRESH Operation\nPDF: 09005aef8091e6d1\n256Mb_sdr.pdf - Rev.

If power-down occurs when all banks are idle,\nthis mode is referred to as precharge power-down; if power-down occurs when there is a\nrow active in any bank, this mode is referred to as active power-down. Entering power-\ndown deactivates the input and output buffers, excluding CKE, for maximum power\nsavings while in standby. The device cannot remain in the power-down state longer\nthan the refresh period (64ms) because no REFRESH operations are performed in this\nmode.\nThe power-down state is exited by registering a NOP or COMMAND INHIBIT with CKE\nHIGH at the desired clock edge (meeting tCKS).\nFigure 54: Power-Down Mode\n \nAll bankstCHtCLtCK\nTwo clock cyclesCKECLK\nDQ\nAll banks idle, enter \npower-down modePrecharge all\nactive banksInput buffers gated off \nwhile in power-down mode\nExit power-down mode(\n)(\n)\nDon’t CaretCKStCKS\nCommandtCMH tCMS\nPRECHARGE NOP NOP ACTIVE NOP(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nAll banks idleBA0, BA1 Bank Bank(s)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nHigh-ZtAH tAStCKHtCKS\nDQM(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nAddressRow (\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nSingle bankA10Row(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)T0 T1 T2 Tn + 1 Tn + 2\n(\n)(\n)\nNote: 1.

In the clock suspend mode, the internal clock is deactivated, freezing\nthe synchronous logic.\nFor each positive clock edge on which CKE is sampled LOW, the next internal positive\nclock edge is suspended. Any command or data present on the input balls when an in-\nternal clock edge is suspended will be ignored; any data present on the DQ balls re-\nmains driven; and burst counters are not incremented, as long as the clock is suspen-\nded.\nExit clock suspend mode by registering CKE HIGH; the internal clock and related opera-\ntion will resume on the subsequent positive clock edge.\nFigure 55: Clock Suspend During WRITE Burst\n \nDon’t CareDINCommand\nAddressWRITE\nBank,\nCol n\nDINNOP NOPCLKT2 T1 T4 T3 T5 T0\nCKE\nInternal\nclock\nNOP\nDINDIN\nNote: 1.
