They are intended for balanced data \ntransmission and comply with both Electronics Industries Association (EIA) RS-485 and RS-422 standards. Both products \ncontain a single differential line driver and a single differential line receiver, making them suitable for full-duplex data transfer. \nThe ADM489 contains an additional receiver and driver enable \ncontrol. \nThe input impedance is 12 kΩ, allowing 32 transceivers to be \nconnected on the bus. \nThe ADM488/ADM489 operate from a single 5 V ± 10% power \nsupply. Excessive power dissipation caused by bus contention or \noutput shorting is prevented by a thermal shutdown circuit. \nThis feature forces the driver output into a high impedance state \nif, during fault conditions, a significant temperature increase is \ndetected in the internal driver circuitry. \n FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAMS \nADM488\nR\nDRO\nDIA\nB\nZ\nY\n00079-001 \nFigure 1. \nADM489\nR\nDRO\nDIA\nB\nZ\nYDERE\n00079-002 \nFigure 2. \n \nThe receiver contains a fail-safe feature that results in a logic \nhigh output state if the inputs are unconnected (floating). \nThe ADM488/ADM489 are fabricated on BiCMOS, an \nadvanced mixed technology process combining low power \nCMOS with fast switching bipolar technology. \nThe ADM488/ADM489 are fully specified over the industrial \ntemperature range and are available in PDIP , SOIC, and TSSOP \npackages. \n \nADM488/ADM489  \n \nRev.

D | Page 11 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM488/ADM489 are ruggedized RS-485 transceivers \nthat operate from a single 5 V supply. They contain protection \nagainst radiated and conducted interference and are ideally \nsuited for operation in electrically harsh environments or where cables can be plugged/unplugged. They are also immune to \nhigh RF field strengths without special shielding precautions. \nThey are intended for balanced data transmission and comply \nwith both EIA RS-485 and RS-422 standards. They contain a differential line driver and a differential line receiver, and are \nsuitable for full-duplex data transmission. \nThe input impedance on the ADM488/ADM489 is 12 kΩ, \nallowing up to 32 transceivers on the differential bus. The \nADM488/ADM489 operate from a single 5 V ± 10% power \nsupply. A thermal shutdown circuit prevents excessive power dissipation caused by bus contention or by output shorting. \nThis feature forces the driver output into a high impedance state \nif, during fault conditions, a significant temperature increase is \ndetected in the internal driver circuitry. \nThe receiver contains a fail-safe feature that results in a logic \nhigh output state if the inputs are unconnected (floating). A \nhigh level of robustness is achieved using internal protection \ncircuitry, eliminating the need for external protection com-ponents such as tranzorbs or surge suppressors. Furthermore, \nlow electromagnetic emissions are achieved using slew limited drivers, minimizing interference both conducted and radiated. \nThe ADM488/ADM489 can transmit at data rates up to \n250 kbps. A typical application for the ADM488/ADM489 is \nillustrated in Figure 24  showing a full-duplex link where data is \ntransferred at rates of up to 250 kbps. A terminating resistor is \nshown at both ends of the link. This termination is not critical because the slew rate is controlled by the ADM488/ADM489 \nand reflections are minimized. \nADM488\nDRO\nDIA\nB\nZ\nY\nDE5V\n0.1µF\nRS-485/RS-422 LINKR\nRADM4895V\n0.1µF\nD\nRODIDE\nGND GNDVCC VCC\nABZYRE\nRE\n00079-024 \nFigure 24.

Electrical fast transients occur as a result \nof arcing contacts in switches and relays. The tests simulate the \ninterference generated when, for example, a power relay disconnects \nan inductive load. A spark is generated due to the well known \nback EMF effect. In fact, the spark consists of a burst of sparks as the relay contacts separate. The voltage appearing on the line, therefore, consists of a burst of extremely fast transient impulses. A similar effect occurs when switching on fluorescent lights.\n \nThe fast transient burst test, defined in IEC1000-4-4, simulates \nthis arcing, and its waveform is illustrated in Figure 25 . It \nconsists of a burst of 2.5 kHz to  5 kHz transients repeating at \n300 ms intervals. It is specified for both power and data lines. \nFour severity levels are defined in terms of an open-circuit voltage as a function of installation environment. The installation \nenvironments are defined as \n• Well protected \n• Protected \n• Typical industrial \n• Severe industrial \nADM488/ADM489  \n \nRev.

The clamp is 1 m long and completely sur-\nrounds the cable, providing maximum coupling capacitance \n(50 pF to 200 pF typical) between the clamp and the cable. High energy transients are capacitively coupled onto the signal lines. \nFast rise times (5 ns), as specified by the standard, result in very \neffective coupling. This test is very severe because high voltages \nare coupled onto the signal lines. The repetitive transients often cause problems, while single pulses do not. Destructive latch-up can be induced due to the high energy content of the transients. \nNote that this stress is applied while the interface products are \npowered up and transmitting data. The EFT test applies hun-\ndreds of pulses with higher energy than ESD. Worst-case \ntransient current on an I/O line can be as high as 40 A. \nRC\nCCZSL RMCD HIGH\nVOLTAGE\nSOURCE50Ω\nOUTPUT\n00079-026 \nFigure 26. EFT Generator Test results are classified according to the following: \n• Normal performance within specification limits. \n• Temporary degradation or loss of performance that is self-\nrecoverable. \n• Temporary degradation or loss of function or performance \nthat requires operator intervention or system reset. \n• Degradation or loss of function that is not recoverable due \nto damage. \nThe ADM488/ADM489 have been tested under worst-case \nconditions using unshielded cables, and meet Classification 2 at \nSeverity Level 4. Data transmission during the transient \ncondition is corrupted, but it can be resumed immediately \nfollowing the EFT event without user intervention. \nRADIATED IMMUNITY (IEC1000-4-3) \nIEC1000-4-3 (previously IEC801-3) describes the measurement \nmethod and defines the levels of immunity to radiated electro-\nmagnetic fields. It was originally intended to simulate the \nelectromagnetic fields generated by portable radio transceivers or any other device that generates continuous wave-radiated \nelectromagnetic energy. Its scope has been broadened to include spurious EM energy, which can be radiated from fluorescent lights, thyristor drives, inductive loads, and so on. \nTesting for immunity involves irradiating the device with an \nEM field. Test methods include the use of anechoic chamber, \nstripline cell, TEM cell, and GTEM cell. These consist of two \nparallel plates with an electric field developed between them. \nThe device under test is placed between the plates and exposed \nto the electric field. The three severity levels have field strengths \nranging from 1 V/m to 10 V/m. Results are classified as follows: \n• Normal operation. \n• Temporary degradation or loss of function that is self-\nrecoverable when the interfering signal is removed. \n• Temporary degradation or loss of function that requires \noperator intervention or system reset when the interfering \nsignal is removed. \n• Degradation or loss of function that is not recoverable due \nto damage. \n  ADM488/ADM489\n \nRev.

The noise is measured using a \nLISN (line impedance stabilizing network) and a spectrum \nanalyzer. The test setup is shown in Figure 28 . The spectrum \nanalyzer is set to scan the spectrum from 0 MHz to 30 MHz. \nFigure 29  shows that the level of conducted emissions from the \nADM488/ADM489 is well below the maximum allowable limits. \nDUT LISN PSUSPECTRUM\nANALYZER\n00079-028 \nFigure 28.

D | Page 14 of 16 APPLICATION INFORMATION \nDIFFERENTIAL DATA TRANSMISSION \nDifferential data transmission is used to reliably transmit data at \nhigh rates over long distances and through noisy environments. \nDifferential transmission nullifies the effects of ground shifts \nand noise signals, which appear as common-mode voltages on \nthe line. Two main standards that specify the electrical \ncharacteristics of transceivers used in differential data \ntransmission are approved by the EIA. \nThe RS-422 standard specifies data rates up to 10 MBaud and \nline lengths up to 4000 ft. A single driver can drive a transmis-\nsion line with up to 10 receivers. \nTo cater to true multipoint communications, the RS-485 stan-\ndard was defined to meet or exceed the requirements of RS-422. \nIt also allows up to 32 drivers and 32 receivers to be connected \nto a single bus. An extended common-mode range of −7 V to +12 V is defined. The most significant difference between the \nRS-422 and RS-485 is that the RS-485 drivers can be disabled, thereby allowing up to 32 receivers to be connected to a single \nline. Only one driver should be enabled at a time, but the RS-\n485 standard contains additional specifications to guarantee \ndevice safety in the event of line contention. CABLE AND DATA RATE \nThe transmission line of choice for RS-485 communications is a \ntwisted pair. Twisted-pair cable tends to cancel common-mode \nnoise and also causes cancellation of the magnetic fields gener-\nated by the current flowing through each wire, thereby reducing the effective inductance of the pair. \nThe ADM488/ADM489 are designed for bidirectional data \ncommunications on multipoint transmission lines. A typical \napplication showing a multipoint transmission network is \nillustrated in Figure 30 . An RS-485 transmission line can have \nup to 32 transceivers on the bus. Only one driver can transmit \nat a particular time, but multiple receivers can be simultane-\nously enabled. \nAs with any transmission line, it is important that reflections be \nminimized. This can be achieved by terminating the extreme \nends of the line using resistors equal to the characteristic im-\npedance of the line. Stub lengths of the main line should also be kept as short as possible. A properly terminated transmission \nline appears purely resistive to the driver. \n \nTable 10.
