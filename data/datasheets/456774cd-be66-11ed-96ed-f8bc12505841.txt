In addition, the cable provides a means of indirectly programming Platform Flash XL, third-party SPI flash memory devices, and third-party parallel NOR flash memory devices via the FPGA JTAG port. Furthermore, Platform Cable USB II is a cost effective tool for debugging 36\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n2embedded software and firmware when us ed with applications such as Xilinx\'s Embedded Development Kit and ChipScope \nPro Analyzer.\nPlatform Cable USB II is an upgrade to and replaces Platform Cable USB. Similar to its popular predecessor, Platform Cable \nUSB II is intended for prototyping environments only. Platform Cable USB II is backwards Compatible with Platform Cable USB and is supported by all Xilinx design tools that support Platform Cable USB.\nPlatform Cable USB II attaches to the USB port on a deskto p or laptop PC using an off-the-shelf Hi-Speed USB A–B cable. \nThe cable derives all operating power from the hub port controller — no external power supply is required.\nNote:\nSustained data transfer rates in a Hi-Speed USB environment va ry according to the number of USB devices sharing the hub \nbandwidth. Native signaling rate (480 MHz) is not directly correlated to application throughput.\nDevice configuration and programming operations using Pl atform Cable USB II are suppor ted by Xilinx iMPACT download \nsoftware using boundary-scan (I EEE 1149.1/IEEE 1532), slave-serial mode , or serial peri pheral interface (SPI). The Vivado \ndesign tools support device  configuration with the Platform Cable USB II using boundary- scan (IEEE 1149.1).\nNote: iMPACT software is bundled with the ISE design tools and WebPAC K™ ISE software. The slave-serial mode and direct SPI are \nonly supported in limited versions of the ISE iMPACT tool.\nIn addition, Platform Cable USB II is op timized for use with the Xilin x Embedded Development Kit,  ChipScope Pro Analyzer, \nand System Generator for DSP. When used with these software tools, the cable provides a connection to embedded target systems for hardware configuration, software download, and real-time debug and verification. Target clock speeds are selectable from 750 kHz to 24 MHz.\nPlatform Cable USB II attaches to target systems using a 14-conductor ribbon cable designed for high-bandwidth data \ntransfers. An optional adapter for attach ing a flying lead set is included for backward compat ibility with target systems not \nusing a ribbon cable connector.\nX-Ref Target - Figure 1\nFigure 1: Xilinx Platform Cable USB II\nDS593_01_02140 8\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n3Physical Description\nThe Platform Cable USB II electronics are housed in a recyclable, fire-retardant plastic case ( Figure 2 ). An internal EMI \nshield attenuates interna lly generated emissions and protects against susceptibilit y to radiated emissions.\nOperation\nThis section describes how to connect and use Platform Cable USB II.\nMinimum Host System Requirements\nThe host computer must contain a USB Host Controller with one or more USB ports. The controller can reside on the PC \nmotherboard, or can be added using an expansion or PCMCIA card.\nPlatform Cable USB II is designed to take full advantage of the bandwidth of USB 2.0 ports, but it is also backward-\ncompatible with USB 1. 1 ports. Refer to USB Hub Types and Cable Performance, page 29  for additional information on \nconnection environments and bandwidth.\nFor Platform Cable USB II compatibility with Vivado design tools, see the Vivado design tools release notes .

The Architecture \nSupport and Requirements  chapter in the release notes lists supported operating systems and cable installation \nrequirements.\nTable 1  lists Platform Cable USB II compat ibility with the Xilinx design tools.\nThe minimum system requirements for Vivado design tools are outlined in the Vivado design tools release notes . The \nArchitecture Support and Requirements  chapter in the release notes lists supported operating systems and cable \ninstallation requirements.\nThe minimum system requirements for ISE design tools are outlined in the ISE design tools release notes . The Architecture \nSupport and Requirements  chapter in the release notes lists supported operating systems and cable installation \nrequirements.\nNote: To receive the current enhancements and bug fixes, Xilinx recomm ends using the newest version of a tool and applying the latest  \nservice pack.\nOperating Power\nPlatform Cable USB II is a bus-powered device (drawing less than 150 mA from the host USB port under all operating \nconditions), automati cally adapting to the capabilities of  the host USB port to achieve the highest possible performance.\nPlatform Cable USB II enumerates on any USB port type: USB ports  on root hubs, external bus-powered hubs, external self-\npowered hubs and legacy USB 1.1 hubs (see USB Hub Types and Cable Performance, page 29 ). However, performance is \nnot optimal when attached to USB 1.1 hubs (refer to Hot Plug and Play, page 5  for an explanation of USB enumeration).\nDevice Driver Installation\nFor a complete guide to installation of the Platform Cable USB II refer to the USB Cable Installation Guide  (UG344 ).\nA proprietary device driver is required to use Platform Cable USB II. This driver is automatically installed when a supported \nXilinx design tool is installed.\nNote: Automatic driver installation is available beginning with versi on 10.1 of Xilinx design tools. Fo r earlier versions, a driver i nstaller \nmust be run prior to using the cable. Refer to the USB Cable Installation Guide  for instructions on downloading and running the installer.\nFirmware Updates\nThe Platform Cable USB II firmware resides in an USB mi crocontroller and a FPGA/PROM. The microcontroller is RAM-\nbased and firmware is downloaded each time the cable is co nnected and detected by the host operating system. Additional \nfirmware can also be downloaded to the microcontroller once a design tool establishes a connection with the cable. The USB \nprotocol guarantees that the firmware is successfully downloaded.\nUpgraded firmware for th e USB microcontroller is periodicall y distributed in Xilinx design tool  releases or, on rare occasions,  \nin a Xilinx Answer Record . In most cases, an upgrade requires replacing one or more of the design tool\'s application files and \ndepending on operating system, one or more cable driver files.\nPlatform Cable USB II contains a Xilinx Spartan-3A FPGA with an in-system programmable  Xilinx XCF02S PROM. Each \ntime a design tool establishes a connection with the cable, the firmware version stored in the PROM is examined. The PROM Table  1: Platform Cable USB II Software Compatibility\nSoftware Version\nVivado Design Tools 2013.1 and later\nISE Foundation/ISE Web PACK 6.3i SP3 and later\nChipScope Pro Analyze r 6.3i SP3 and later\nEmbedded Development Kit 7.1i and later\nSystem Generator for DSP 8.1i and later\nNotes: \n1. An installer must be run to enable Platform Cable USB II for use with Xilinx design tools \nprior to 10.1. Refer to Device Driver Installation, page 4  for additional details.\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n5is automatically reprogrammed over the cable if the firmware versio n is out of date. If an update is required, the design tool \ndisplays the followi ng warning message:\nWarning: USB Cable firmware must be updated. This operation may take up to 40 seconds. Do not stop \nthe process or disconnect the cable prior to completion. The cable STATUS LED will be RED for the \nduration of the update process.\nSimilarly, upgraded firmware for the FPGA/PROM is periodically distributed in Xilinx design tool releases or, on rare \noccasions, in a Xilinx Answer Record . In most cases, an upgrade requires replacing a single design tool application file. The \nPROM is reprogrammed with the new firmware the next time the tool connects to the cable. PROM reprogramming takes approximately 40 seconds over a USB 2.0 port and 60 seconds over a USB 1.1 port. Reprogramming times vary depending on the Xilinx design tool version,  the type of USB port and the performance of the host system.\nDuring a PROM update, the cabl e\'s status LED illuminates red ( Figure 8, page 11 ), and a progress bar indicates \ncommunication activity. PROM updates should never be interrupt ed. When an update is complete, the status LED returns to \neither amber or green, and the cable is ready for normal operation.\nHot Plug and Play\nPlatform Cable USB II can be attached and removed from the host computer without the need to power-down or reboot. There is a momentary delay  after connecting the cable to an  available port before the status LED illumina tes — this process \nis called enumeration.\nConnecting to the Cable in the Vivado Design Tools\nFor instructions on connecting the cable in the Vivado design tools, see the Setting Up  section in the Vivado Design Suite \nTutorial: Programming and Debugging .\nConnecting to the Cable in iMPACT Software\nThis section describes some of the wa ys to connect to Platform Cable USB II  using the Xilinx iMPACT graphical user \ninterface (GUI). For cable commun ication using other Xilinx design tools or method s, please refer to th e appropriate software \nuser guide.\nSelect a Flow\nFrom the iMPACT GUI, select a flow on the Modes tab (Figure 3 ). Double-click on the desired flow.\nX-Ref Target - Figure 3\nFigure 3: iMPACT (9.2i) Modes Tab\nDS593_03_02140 8\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n6Note: For a description of the different flows, please refer to iMPACT →  Help . \nEstablishing a Connection\nOnce a flow is selected, there are a number of ways to establish a connection with the cable. Two common options are \ndescribed here:\nOption 1: Cable Auto Connect\nTo auto connect the cable, select Output  →  Cable Auto Connect  (Figure 4 ).\nNote: During the auto-connect sequence, the iMPACT tool selects Parallel  Cable IV (PC4) as the active cable if both PC4 and Platform \nCable USB II are connected to the same host system. If two or mo re USB cables are connected to the same host, the active cable is the \nfirst USB cable physically conn ected to the host system. See Multiple USB Cable Management, page 7 , for information on controlling \nmore than one USB cable from a single application.\nOption 2: Manual Cable Connect\nTo manually connect the cable, select Output  →  Cable Setup . Select the Xilinx USB Cable  radio button in the Cable \nCommunication Setup dialog box ( Figure 5 ).X-Ref Target - Figure 4\nFigure 4: iMPACT Software (9.2i) Output Pull-Down Menu\nDS593_04_02140 8\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n7It is necessary to perform a cable disconnect when switching fr om boundary-scan or Direct SPI Configuration mode to slave-\nserial mode, or vice versa. iMPACT software can be disconnected from the cable using Output →  Cable Disconnect  \n(Figure 4, page 6 ). After the mode switch is complete, reestablish the cable connection using the Output →  Cable Setup  \ndialog. It is not necessary, however, to perform a cable di sconnect when switching between boundary-scan and Direct SPI \nConfiguration modes.\nIf an iMPACT session is active when an Output →  Cable Disconnect  or Output →  Disconnect All Cables  operation is \nperformed, or if the cable is physically disconnected from the host system, the Cable Status Bar ( Figure 7, page 10 ) at the \nbottom, right-hand edge of the GUI immediately indicates a No Cable Connection .\nXilinx design tools employ system semaph ores to manage access to Xilinx cabl es, allowing multiple applications to \nsimultaneously access (connect to) a single cable (but only on e application can perform cable operations at a given time). \nFor example, assume two instances of iMPACT (instance A and in stance B) are connected to a single cable. If A begins a \nprogramming operation, and B then attempts a programming operation, B is temporarily blocked from accessing the cable. B receives a message indicating that the cable is locked,  and the operation must be attempted again later.\nMultiple USB Cable Management\nPlatform Cable USB II contains a 64-bit electronic serial number used by applications to uniquely identify and access a \nspecific USB cable when multiple USB cables (up to 127) are connected to the same host. iMPACT software provides a \ndialog box ( Figure 6, page 8 ) allowing users to select a specific cable from a list of attached cables. When one of the cables \nin the list is highlighted, the status LED on the appropriate cable blinks, allowing users to make a logical-to-physical association. When the desired cable is connected  and the dialog box closed, the status LED no longer blinks.\nThe Cable Setup Information dialog box ( Figure 6 ) appears when the Advanced USB Cable Setup  button is pressed in the \nCable Communication Setup dialog box ( Figure 5 ).\nNote:\nThe multiple USB cable management feature is only available in iMPACT software version 10.1 and later. Refer to the iMPACT \nsection of Xilinx ISE software manuals  for additional details on this feature.X-Ref Target - Figure 5\nFigure 5: iMPACT Software (10.1) Cable Communication SetupDS593_05_02140 8\n\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n8Configuration Clock Speed\nThe Platform Cable USB II configuration clock (TCK_CCLK_SCK) frequency is selectable. Table 2  shows the complete set \nof available TCK_CCLK_SCK speed selections.\niMPACT 7.1i (and later) provides a feature wherein the BSDL f ile of each device in a target JTAG chain is scanned to \ndetermine the maximum boundary-scan clock (JTAG TCK) frequency. iMPACT 7.1i (and later) automatically restricts the available TCK_CCLK_SCK selections to fr equencies less than or equal to the slowest device in the chain. By default, \niMPACT 7.1i (or later) selects either 6 MHz or the highest common frequency when any device in the JTAG chain is not \ncapable of 6 MHz operation. Table 3  shows the maximum s upported JTAG TCK fre quency for a variety of Xilinx devices. See \nthe device data sheet or BSDL file for maximum JTAG TCK specifications.\nNote:\nCertain Xilinx design tools and iMPACT versions earlier than 7.1i  do not restrict the TCK_CCLK_SCK selections in JTAG mode. \nAccordingly, users should take care to select a TCK_CCLK_SCK frequency matching the JTAG TCK specifications for the slowest dev ice \nin the target chain.\nIn slave-serial or direct SPI configuration mode, the TC K_CCLK_SCK speed can be set to any one of the available \nselections. By default, the TCK_CCLK_SCK speed is set to 6 MHz. Users should take care to select a TCK_CCLK_SCK \nfrequency matching the slave-serial clock (CCLK or  SPI clock) specification of the target device.X-Ref Target - Figure 6\nFigure 6: iMPACT (10.1) Cabl e Setup Information\nTable  2: Configuration Speed Selections\nTCK_CCLK_SCK Frequency Notes\n24 MHz 24 MHz is supported in limited versions of the ISE iMPACT tool up to version 11.5.\n12 MHz\n6 MHz (Default)\n3M H z\n1.5 MHz\n750 kHz\nTable  3: Maximum JTAG Clock Frequencies\nDevice Family Maximum JTAG  Clock Frequency (MHz)\nZynq-7000 66 MHz\nVirtex-7 15–66 MHz\nKintex-7 15–66 MHzArtix-7 15–66 MHzDS593_06_02140 8\n\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n9Virtex-6 33–66 MHz\nSpartan-6 18–33 MHz\nXC9500XL 10XPLA3 10CoolRunner-II 33\nXC18V00 10\nXCF00S/XCF00P 15Virtex 33\nVirtex-II 33\nVirtex-II Pro 33Virtex-4 33\nVirtex-5 33\nSpartan-II 33Spartan-3 33\nSpartan-3A 33\nSpartan-3AN\n(50, 200 and 400 densities)33\nSpartan-3AN\n(700 and 1400 densities)20\nSpartan-3E 30\nNotes: \n1.

For \nexample, if the host port is USB 2.0, Platform Cable USB II  connects at Hi-Speed and the status bar shows usb-hs. If the \nhost port is USB 1.1, Platform Cable USB II connects at full- speed, and the status bar shows usb-fs. Finally, the status bar \ndisplays the active cable and TCK_CCLK_SCK frequency.\nStatus Indicator\nPlatform Cable USB II uses a tri-color status LED to indicate the presence of target voltage and to indicate that a cable firmware update is in progress ( Figure 8 ). \nWhen the cable is connected (using a ribbon cable, or flying leads) to a mating connector on the target system, the status \nLED is illuminated as a function of the voltage present on pin 2 (V\nREF). Users must design their system hardware with pin 2 \nattached to a voltage plane suppling the JTAG, SPI, or slave-serial  pins on the target device(s). Some devices have separate \npower pins for this purpose (VAUX), while others have a common supply for both VCCIO and the JTAG pins (TCK, TMS, TDI, \nand TDO). Refer to the target device data sheet for details on JTAG, slave serial, or SPI pins.\nThe status LED is amber when any one or more of the following conditions exist:\x81 The cable is not connected to a target system\n\x81 The target system is not powered\n\x81 The voltage on the V\nREF pin is ≤ +1.3V.\nThe status LED is green when all of the following conditions exist:\n\x81 The cable is connected to a target system\n\x81 The target system is powered\n\x81 The voltage on the VREF pin is ≥ +1.5V.\nNote: There is 200 mV of hysteresis in the VREF detection circuit. If VREF drops below 1.3V, the status LED turns amber and does not \nturn green until VREF is raised above 1.5V.\nThe status LED is red whenever a cable firmware update is in progress.X-Ref Target - Figure 7\nFigure 7: iMPACT (10.1) Cable Status Bar\nDS593_07_02190 8\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n11The status LED is off whenever Platform Cable USB II enters a suspend state (see System Suspend, page 12 ), is \ndisconnected from a USB port, or is connected to an un-powered USB port.\nTable 4  summarizes the various status LED states.\nTable  4: Interpreting the Status LED\nLED Color LED State Condition\nOFF Continuous Host power OFF\nAMBER Continuous Target VREF ≤ 1.3V\nAMBER Blinking Target VREF ≤ 1.3V AND multiple cable identification active\nGREEN Continuous Target VREF ≥ 1.5V \nGREEN Blinking Target VREF ≥ 1.5V AND multiple cable identification active\nRED Continuous FPGA firmware update in progress\nX-Ref Target - Figure 8\nFigure 8: Cable Status LED\nAmber indic ates no target volt age (VREF)\nGreen indic ates target volt age (VREF) present\nRed indic ates cable firmw are update\nDS593_08_120 307\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n12System Suspend\nThe cable\'s status LED is extinguished when the host system enters a suspend (power-saving) state. A system can suspend \nfor a number of reasons. For example:\n\x81 The user puts the host system into standby or hibernate.\n\x81 The suspend function key on a laptop computer is pressed.\n\x81 The display panel of a laptop is closed.\x81 The host system is configured to suspend (standby or hibernate) after a specified amount of inactivity.\nThe current drawn by the cable while suspended depends on the type of suspend state: standby or hibernate. While the host \nsystem is in standby, the cable draws approximately 350 µA from  the USB port. When the host is hibernating, all power is \nremoved from the USB ports so the cable draws no current while in this state.\nThe target interface output drivers are not powered while the host is suspended. These signals float to any DC bias level \nprovided by the target hardware during suspend.\nIf an iMPACT (10.1 or later) operation is in progress when suspend is attempted, iMPACT displays a message ( Figure 9 ) \nindicating that suspend is blocked until the operation is complete or manually aborted.\nNote:\nThis feature is not supported in earlier versions of iMPACT, wh ile iMPACT is operating in batch mode, or by other Xilinx design  \ntools. In these cases, it is recommended that suspend be disabled in the host system  when performing long, continuous operation s.\nThe cable is automatically disconnected when the host system is suspended. A reconnect is necessary when the host re-\nawakens from the suspend state (see Connecting to the Cable in iMPACT Software, page 5 ).\nPlatform Cable USB II Connections\nThis section discusses physical connect ions from Platform Cable USB II to the host PC and the target system.\nHigh Performance Ribbon Cable\nA 6-inch ribbon cable is supplied and recommended for connection to target systems ( Figure 10 ). The cable incorporates \nmultiple signal-groun d pairs and facilitates error-free co nnections. The Xilinx prod uct number for the 6-inch ribbon cable is \nHW-RIBBON14.\nTo take advantage of the ribbon cable, a mating connector must  be incorporated into the target system. This connector is \nnormally installed only during prototype checkout. When the production hardware is functional and the ISP devices can be \nconfigured from alternate sources, the connector can be eliminated to reduce cost. Maintaining the footprint for this connector is recommended if space permits.X-Ref Target - Figure 9\nFigure 9: Suspend Warning When iMPACT (10.1 or later) is Busy\nDS593_09_02140 8\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n13The connector is a 2 mm shrouded keyed header. See Table 5, page 15  for vendor part numbers and pin assignments.\nFlying Wire Adapter\nAn adapter with wires ( Figure 11 ) is provided for attachment to legacy target systems that do not incorporate a shrouded \n2 mm connector. The adapter makes it possible to use flying wir es for connections to distributed terminals on a target \nsystem.\nThe adapter is a small circuit board with two connectors ( Figure 12 ). The connector on the bottom side of the adapter mates \nwith the 14-pin Platform Cable USB II male 2 mm connector. A 7-pin right-angle header on the top side of the adapter mates with the standard X ilinx flying wire set.\nNote:\nThis method of connection is not recommende d because it can result in poor signal in tegrity. Additionally, damage can result if  the \nleads are unintentionally connected to high voltages.\nThe Xilinx product number  for the flying wire set is HW-USB-FLYLEADS-G.X-Ref Target - Figure 10\nNotes: \n1.

Each example \nincorporates the 2 mm connector (see Target Interface Connectors, page 15 ) as the cable interface. Diagrams in this section \nprovide a functional relationship between th e cable interface and the target devices.\nNote: Signal integrity is not considered in these examples. Refer to Signal Integrity, page 28  for details on buffering and termination.\nJTAG and Slave Serial\nMultiple devices can be cascaded wh en using either a JTAG or slave- serial topology in target systems. Figure 15  and \nFigure 17, page 18  show typical routing for JTAG and slave-serial topologies, respectively.\nNote: The cable supports the slave-serial topology with iMPACT v10.1 onl y. The Vivado Design Tools do not support slave-serial with t he \ncable.\nPlatform Cable USB II provides a multi-use signal on its target interface connector called pseudo ground (PGND). The \nPGND pin is connected to an open-drain driver (see Pseudo Ground Signal in iMPACT, page 23 ); hence, it is either Low or \nhigh-Z. The behavior of PGND is determined by the host app lication connected to the cable. In iMPACT, PGND is active-Low \nduring JTAG, slave-serial and SPI operations (for example, programming, configuration, read back, etc.) and high-Z when the cable is idle.\nFigure 16, page 17  shows a typical use of PGND as a control signal to manage a target system’s JTAG chain. PGND drives \nthe select (S) term on a set of multiplexers that switch between the primary configuration source and the cable. When PGND is active-Low, the cable drives the JTAG chain. When PGND is high-Z, the primary configuration source drives the JTAG chain. This capability allows Platform Cabl e USB II to remain attached to the target system while remaining isolated from the \nprimary configuration source. A similar scheme can be used with slave-serial topologies.\nNote:\nPGND is supported in Vivado Hardware Manager and Xilinx SDK tools. These tools drive PGND Low while the application is \nconnected to the cable. PGND is  high-Z when all applications are disconnected from the cable.\nNote: PGND is supported in iMPACT versions 10.1 and later. PGND remain s high-Z in earlier versions of iMPACT and in Xilinx design \ntools that do not support PGND.\nThe DONE pin on FPGAs can be programmed to be an open-drain  or active driver. For cascaded slave-serial topologies, an \nexternal pull-up resistor should be used, and all devices should be programmed for open-drain operation.\nX-Ref Target - Figure 15\nNotes: \n1.

Figure 18, page 19  shows an example SPI flash \nconnection. The application note Configuring Xilinx FPGAs with SPI Serial Flash  (XAPP951 ) provides additional details of \nthe cable connections necessary to program a FPGA bitstream into a SPI flash device.\nNote: See Configuring Xilinx FPGAs with SPI Serial Flash  for a list of supported SPI devices. Di rect SPI is supported with iMPACT v10.1 \nonly. The Vivado Design Tools do not support direct SPI with the cable.\nBy connecting PGND to PROG_B of the FPGA ( Figure 17 ), the FPGA can be commanded to set its SPI signals to high-Z \nwhile the cable programs a SPI flash device. PGND is pulled Low when the cable is driving its SPI signals in SPI mode and \nset to high-Z when the cable is not driving its SPI signals. PGND eliminates the need for a hardware jumper to ground on the PROG_B signal and the need for additional control logic. PGND is controlled by an open-drain driver.\nNote:\nPGND control for SPI programming is available in iMPACT versions 9.2i and later.\nX-Ref Target - Figure 17\nNotes: \n1.

For a description of the indirect Platform \nFlash programming solution, see the Platform Flash XL User Guide  (UG438 ).\nFor a complete description on using Platform Cable USB II for indirect programming of third-BPI PROMs and for a complete \nlist of supported BPI PROMs, refer to the iMPACT Flash device support table .\nTarget Interface Reference Voltage and Signals\nTarget Reference Voltage Sensing (VREF)\nPlatform Cable USB II incorporates an over-voltage clamp on the VREF pin of the 2 mm ribbon cable connector. The clamped \nvoltage (VREF_CLAMP ) supplies high-slew-rate buffers that drive each of the output signals (see Output Driver Structure ). \nVREF must be a regulated voltage.\nNote: Do not insert a current-limiting resistor  in the target system between the VREF supply and pin 2 on the 2 mm connector.\nWhen Platform Cable USB II is idle, a nominal amount of current is drawn from the target system VREF. Figure 19  shows the \nVREF current as a function of VREF voltage.\nNo damage to Platform Cable USB II occurs if the A–B cable is  unplugged from the host while the ribbon cable or flying leads \nare attached to a powered target system. Similarly, no damage to target systems occurs if Platform Cable USB II is powered and attached to the target system wh ile the target system power is off.\nBidirectional Signal Pins\nPlatform Cable USB II provides five bidirectional si gnal pins: TDI_DIN_MOSI, TDO_DONE_MISO, TCK_CCLK_SCK, \nTMS_PROG_SS and HALT_INT_WP. Each pin incorporates the same I/O structure. The state of each pin (reading or writing) is determined by the current mode of the cable (JTAG, SPI, or slave-serial).\nOutput Driver Structure\nEach output signal is routed through a NC7SZ126 ultra high-speed CMOS buffer ( Figure 20, page 21 ). Series-damping \nresistors (30.1 Ω) reduce reflections. Weak pull-up resistors (20 k Ω) terminating at VREF_CLAMP  maintain a defined logic level \nwhen the buffers are set to high-Z. Schottky diodes provide the output buffers with undershoot protection.\nThe FPGA sets the output buffers to high-Z when VREF drops below 1.30 V. In addition, an over-voltage Zener on VREF \nclamps VREF_CLAMP  to approximately 3.9V.\nFigure 21, page 22  shows the relationship between the output drive voltage and VREF.\nNote: The output drivers are enabled only dur ing cable operations; otherwise, they are set to high-Z between operations.\nXilinx design tools actively drive the outputs  to logic 1 before setting the respective  buffer to high-Z, avoiding the possibil ity \nof a slow rise-time transition caused by a charge path through the pull-up resistor into parasitic capacitance on the target \nsystem.\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n21X-Ref Target - Figure 19\nFigure 19: VREF Current vs. VREF Voltage\nX-Ref Target - Figure 20\nFigure 20: Target Interface Driver Topology\nDS593_19_02140 8\nFPGA\nNC7SZ126\nOutput\nHigh-Z ControlI/O Pin2-mm Connector\nBAT54VREF_CLAMPVREF_CLAMP\n30.1Ω 20 k Ω\nTo inp ut buffer\nDS593_20_02140 8\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n22Input Receive Structure\nFigure 22  shows the input receive structure. Each input signal is routed through a NC7WZ07 ultra high-speed CMOS, open-\ndrain receive buffer. Series-termination resistors (499 Ω) provide current limit protection for positive and negative excursions. \nSchottky diodes provide the input buffers with undershoot pr otection. The receive buffers are biased by an internal 1.8V \npower supply. See Table 9, page 33  for VIL and VIH specifications. The receive buffers can tolerate voltages higher than the \nbias voltage without damage, compensating for target system dr ivers in multi-device chains where the last device in the \nchain might be referenced to a voltage other than VREF (for example, the TDO output at the end of a JTAG chain).X-Ref Target - Figure 21\nFigure 21: Output Drive Voltage vs. VREF\nX-Ref Target - Figure 22\nFigure 22: Target Interface Receiver Topology\nOutput Drive Volt age (V)\nVREF Voltage (VDC)DS593_21_02140 8\nFPGANC7WZ07\nInputI/O Pin2 mm Connector\nBAT54499Ω To output buffer\nDS593_22_02140 8\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n23Pseudo Ground Signal in iMPACT\nThe pseudo ground (PGND) pin on target interface connector is  routed to a ultra-high-speed buffer with an open-drain output \n(Figure 23 ). A pull-up resistor is required on target  systems that utilize this signal. The buffer can tolerate  a pull-up voltage \nas high as 6.0V.\nHALT_INIT_WP Signal in iMPACT\nPlatform Cable USB II provides a second multi-use signal on it s target interface connector called HALT_INIT_WP (this signal \nis referred to as HALT when the cable is in JTAG mode). Th e HALT_INIT_WP pin is connected to a three-state CMOS driver \n(see Bidirectional Signal Pins, page 20 ).\nThe behavior of HALT_INIT_WP is determined by the host app lication connected to the cable. iMPACT provides the option \nof enabling the HALT pin during JTAG operations ( Figure 24 ). This option is accessed by c licking on the Xilinx FPGA in the \niMPACT GUI and selecting Edit →  Set Programming Properties…  to open the Device Programming Properties dialog \nbox. Check “Assert Cable INIT during programming” to enable the HALT signal.\nWhen enabled in iMPACT, HALT is active -Low while the cable is performing JTAG  operations on any Xilinx FPGA and high-\nZ when the cable is idle. HALT is active-High while JTAG operations are being performed on other devices. The HALT signal remains high-Z when not enabled (iMPACT default) or  when the cable is in slave-serial or SPI modes.\nNote:\nHALT signal control is available in iMPACT 9.2i and later. Th e Vivado Design Tools do not su pport the HALT function. HALT \nremains high-Z in earlier versions of iMPACT and in Xili nx design tools where the HA LT signal is not supported.X-Ref Target - Figure 23\nFigure 23: PGND SignalFPGA\nNC7WZ07\nPGND_CNTLPGND2-mm Connector\nDS593_23_02150 8Y A\nInput\nAOutput\nY\nH\nLLZ\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n24Timing Specifications\nFor JTAG, SPI, and slave-serial config uration modes, the TDI_DI N_MOSI and TMS_PROG_SS out puts change on falling \nedges of TCK_CCLK_SCK ( Figure 25 ). Target devices sample TDI_DIN_MOSI and TMS_PROG_SS on rising edges of \nTCK_CCLK_SCK. The minimum setup time TTSU(MIN)  for target device sampling of TDI_DIN_MOSI or TMS_PROG_SS is:\nTTSU(MIN) = TCLK/2  – TCPD(MAX)\n= 20.8 ns – 16.0 ns\n= 4.8 ns\nwhere: \nTCLK/2  = TCK_CCLK_SCK low time at 24 MHz,\nTCPD(MAX)  = Maximum TDI_DIN_MOSI or TMS_PROG_SS propagation delay relative to TCK_CCLK_SCK inherent in \nthe output stage of the cable. \nReducing the TCK_CCLK_SCK frequency increases the data setup time at the target.\nNote: Timing specifications apply when VREF = 3.3V. Operations at 24 MHz might not be possible when using a VREF below 3.3V due to \nthe increased propagation delay through the output buffer stage of the cable.\nTDO/MISO Timing Considerations\nDesigners of target systems must take care to observe specific timing requirements for TDO (JTAG chains) or MISO \n(dedicated SPI in-system programming) when incorporating the 2 mm IDC connector. In particular, if an open-drain or open-collector buffer is inserted between TDO (MISO) and the cable, the value of the pull-up resistor at the output of such buffers must be relatively small (for example, less than 330 Ω) to avoid delays associat ed with parasitic capacitance.\nFigure 26, page 26  and Figure 27, page 27  show the timing relationship between TCK and TDO. The signal TDO_SMPL is \nan internal logic signal not available at the target interface, but is shown to highlight the location of the TDO sampling poin t. \nIn Figure 26 , the negative TCK transition at G1 causes the last device in the target system JTAG chain to drive TDO, which \npropagates to the cable at G2. The time from G1 to G2 is the sum of the propagation delays in the driver stage of the target device and the receiver stage of the cable (37 ns in this example).\nIn Figure 27 , the cursors show the total setup time (42 n s) before TDO is sampled by the cable. Figure 28, page 28  is an \nanalog representation of the logical condition shown in Figure 26  and Figure 27  captured at the target system.X-Ref Target - Figure 24\nFigure 24: Enabling the HALT Signal in iMPACT (9.2i)\nDS593_24_02140 8\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n25Note: The propagation delay from TCK to TDO is 26 ns. Because Figure 26  shows a propagation delay of 37 ns, the difference of 11 ns \nis attributable exclusively to input delays in the cable. At 12 MHz, there is still sufficient se tup time before the cable sampl es prior to the \nnext negative TCK transition.\nX-Ref Target - Figure 25\nFigure 25: TDI_DIN_MOSI and TMS_PROG_SS Timi ng with Respect to TCK_CCLK_SCK\nTMS_PROG ch anges on Neg ative\nEdge of TCK_CCLK (G1)TDI_DIN  Ch anges\non Neg ative Edge\nof TCK_CCLK (G2)\nDS593_25_02140 8\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n26X-Ref Target - Figure 26\nFigure 26: TDO Sampling Example at 12 MHz (TDO Propagation Delay)\nDS593_26_02140 8Negative TCK tr ansition at G1 c auses target device to \nchange TDO state, which prop agates to the c able at G2 in \nless than ½ clock cycle in thi s 12-MHz ex ample.\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n27X-Ref Target - Figure 27\nFigure 27: TDO Sampling Example at 12 MHz (TDO Setup Time Relative to Sampling Point)\nDS593_27_01150 8TDO setup time prior to intern al sampling clock (G2 – G1) \nis 42ns in thi s 12-MHz ex ample.  \nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n28Signal Integrity\nPlatform Cable USB II uses high-slew-rate buffers to drive its output pins. Each buffer has a 30.1 Ω series termination \nresistor. Users should pay close attention to PCB la yout to avoid transmission line effects. Visit the Xilinx Signal Integrity \nCentral  website for detailed signal integrity assistance.\nIf the target system has only one programmable device, the 2 mm connector should be located as close as possible to the \ntarget device. If there are multiple devices in a JTAG or slave-serial single chain on the target system, users should consider  \nbuffering TCK_CCLK_SCK. Different ial driver/receiver pairs prov ide excellent signal quality when the rules identified in \nFigure 29  are followed. Buffering is essential if target devices are distributed over a large PCB area.\nEach differential driver and/or receiver pair contributes approximately 5 ns of propagation delay. This delay is insignificant \nwhen using 12 MHz or slower clock speeds.X-Ref Target - Figure 28\nFigure 28: TDO Sampling Example at 12 MHz (Analog Signals on Target System)\nX-Ref Target - Figure 29\nFigure 29: Differential Clock Buffer Example\nDS593_28_02140 8Prop agation del ay from A to B (26 n s) captured directly at \nthe target repre sents 70% of the tot al prop agation del ay \nseen by the c able (Fig ure 25).\nTCK\nTDOTDO Samplin g Point\nTDO Samplin g Point\nSN65LVD S105\nFour Differenti al\nDriver sSN65LVD S2 (2)\nTCK_CCLK_ SCKTCK_CCLK_ SCK1 1\n4 TCK_CCLK_ SCK4\nDS593_29_02140 8Locate driver p ackage adjacent to 2-mm connectorRoute A & B tr aces for e ach differenti al\npair in p arallel with e qual length and \nconsistent spacing\nLocate one receiver adacent\nto each target deviceFour\nBuffered\nClock sSeries Ter min ation Re sistor\n(20Ω −30Ω)\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n29Each differential receiver can drive multiple target device s if there are no branches on the PCB trace and the total trace \nlength is less than four inches. A series termination resist or should be placed adjacent to the single-ended output of the \ndifferential receiver.\nNote: If the target chain has, for example, a JT AG or slave-serial topology and a 24 MHz clock rate is desired, it is recommended that  \nmatching buffers be used for both TCK_CCLK_SCK and TMS_PROG_SS. Matching buffers maintains a consistent phase relationship \nbetween TCK_CCLK_SCK and TMS_PROG_SS. A buffer is not needed for TDI_DIN_MO SI, because it sees only one load.\nUSB Hub Types and Cable Performance\nThere are two important hub specifications affecting the perf ormance of Platform Cable USB II: maximum port current and \ntotal bandwidth.\nMaximum Port Current\nPlatform Cable USB II is a bus-powered device, drawing less than 150 mA from the host USB port under all operating conditions.\nNote:\nSome older USB root hubs or external bus-powered hubs might re strict peripherals to 100 mA. Platform Cable USB II cannot \nenumerate on hubs with the 100 mA restriction.\nTotal Bandwidth\nThe maximum theoretical bandwidth is 480 Mb/s for a single US B 2.0 Hi-Speed device and 12 Mb/s for a single USB 1.1 full-\nspeed device. However, because hub bandwidth must be shared among all connected devices, actual bandwidth is in practice lower than these theoretical values.\nPlatform Cable USB II performance is optimal when enumerat ed on a USB 2.0 Hi-Speed port. Hi-Speed USB operation is \nguaranteed only if the cable is attached directly to a USB 2.0 root hub ( Figure 30E ), or to an external, self-powered USB 2.0 \nhub connected directly to a USB 2.0 root hub ( Figure 30D ).\nIf Platform Cable USB II is attached to a USB 1.1 root hub ( Figure 30A ) or to USB 2.0 external hub connected to a USB 1.1 \nroot hub ( Figure 30B ), the cable enumerates as a full-speed device an d cable performance is degraded. Communication \nand protocol overhead limits any given USB device to approximately 30 % of total bandwidth. For USB 1.1 hubs, the \nmaximum achievable throughput is approximately 3.6 Mb/s.\nCertain self-powered, USB 2.0 hubs can continue to function as  USB 1.1 hubs when disconnected from their external power \nsource ( Figure 30C ). When no external power source is present, thes e hubs draw their power from their upstream USB port. \nIf Platform Cable USB II is connected to such a hub while operating at USB 1.1 speeds, the cable enumerates as a full-\nspeed device. Furthermore, bus-powered hubs can only deliver a total of 500 mA to all connected devices. If individual ports \non bus-powered hubs are limited to less than 150 mA, Platform Cable USB II does not enumerate and is unavailable for use by host software applications.\nPlatform Cable USB II\nDS593 (v1.5.1) August 6, 2018 www.xilinx.com\n30Interface Pin DescriptionsX-Ref Target - Figure 30\nFigure 30: Platform Cable USB II Performance with Various Hub Types\nTable  6: JTAG/SPI/Slave Serial Po rt: 2 mm Connector Signals\nPin\nNumberMODE\nDirection(2)DescriptionJTAG \nConfigurationSPI \nProgramming(1)Slave-Serial \nConfiguration\n2VREF VREF VREF InTarget Reference Voltage(3).
