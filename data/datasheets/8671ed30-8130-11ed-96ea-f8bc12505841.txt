Before using the products, carefully\ncheck the effects on their quality and performance, and determine whether or not they can be used.\n1. In liquid, such as water, oil, chemicals, or organic solvent.\n2. In direct sunlight, outdoors, or in dust.\n3. In salty air or air with a high concentration of corrosive gas, such as Cl2，H2S，NH3，SO2，or NOX .\n4. Electric Static Discharge (ESD) Environment.\nThese components are sensitive to static electricity and can be damaged under static shock (ESD).\n\u3000\u3000Please take measures to avoid any of these environments.\nSmaller components are more sensitive to ESD environment.\n5. Electromagnetic and Radioactive Environment.\nAvoid any environment where strong electromagnetic waves and radiation exist.\n6. In an environment where these products cause dew condensation.\n7. Sealing or coating of these products or a printed circuit board on which these products are mounted, with\nresin or other materials.\n• These products generate Joule heat when energized. Carefully position these products so that their heat will\n  not affect the other components.\n• Carefully position these products so that their temperatures will not exceed the category temperature range \ndue to the effects of neighboring heat-generating components.  Do not mount or place heat-generating \ncomponents or inflammables, such as vinyl-coated wires, near these products.\n• Note that non-cleaning solder, halogen-based highly active flux, or water-soluble flux may deteriorate the\nperformance or reliability of the products.\n• Carefully select a flux cleaning agent for use after soldering. An unsuitable agent may deteriorate the\nperformance or reliability. In particular, when using water or a water-soluble cleaning agent, be careful not to \nleave water residues. Otherwise, the insulation performance may be deteriorated.\n• Do not apply flux to these products after soldering.  The activity of flux may be a cause of failures in these \nproducts.\n• Refer to the recommended soldering conditions and set the soldering condition.  High peak temperature or \nlong heating time may impair the performance or the reliability of these products.\n• Recommended soldering condition is for the guideline for ensuring the basic characteristics of the products, \nnot for the stable soldering conditions. Conditions for proper soldering should be set up according to individual \nconditions.\n01-Oct-19\n\nFixed Resistors\n• Do not reuse any products after removal from mounting boards.\n• Do not drop these products.  If these products are dropped, do not use them.  Such products may have\nreceived mechanical or electrical damage.\n• If any doubt or concern to the safety on these products arise, make sure to inform us immediately and \nconduct technical examinations at your side. \n(2) Precautions for storage\nThe performance of these products, including the solderability, is guaranteed for a year from the date of\narrival at your company, provided that they remain packed as they were when delivered and stored at \na temperature of  5 °C to 35 °C and a relative humidity of 45 % to 85 %.\nEven within the above guarantee periods, do not store these products in the following conditions. \nOtherwise, their electrical performance and/or solderability may be deteriorated, and the packaging\nmaterials (e.g. taping materials) may be deformed or deteriorated, resulting in mounting failures.\n1. In salty air or in air with a high concentration of corrosive gas, such as Cl2，H2S，NH3，SO 2，or NOX .\n2. In direct sunlight.\n(3) AEC-Q200 Compliant\nThe products are tested based on all or part of the test conditions and methods defined in AEC-Q200.\nPlease consult with Panasonic for the details of the product specification and specific evaluation test results, \netc., and please review and approve Panasonic's product specification before ordering.\n＜Package markings＞\nPackage markings include the product number, quantity, and country of origin.\nIn principle, the country of origin should be indicated in English.\n01-Oct-19\n\nSurface Mount Resistors\nSafety Precautions (Common precautions for Surface Mount Resistors)\nThe following are precautions for individual products. Please also refer to the common precautions for Fixed \n Resistors in this catalog.\n1.Take measures against mechanical stress during and after mounting of Surface Mount Resistors \n (hereafter called the resistors) so as not to damage their electrodes and protective coatings.\nBe careful not to misplace the resistors on the land patterns. Otherwise, solder bridging may occur.\n2.Keep the rated power and ambient temperature within the specified derating curve.\nSome circuit boards, wiring patterns, temperatures of heat generated by adjacent components, or \nambient temper a tures can become factors in the rise of the temperature of the resistors, regardless of\nthe level of power applied. Therefore, check the conditions before use and op timize them so as not to  \ndamage the boards and peripheral components. \nMake sure to contact us before using the resistors under special conditions.\n3.If a transient load (heavy load in a short time) like a pulse is expected to be applied, check and evaluate \nthe operations of the resistors when installed in your products before use. Never exceed the rated power.\nOtherwise, the performance and/or reliability of the resistors may be impaired.\n4.Transient voltage \nIf there is a possibility that the transient phenomenon (significantly high voltage applied in a short time) \nmay occur or that a high voltage pulse may be applied, make sure to evaluate and check the\ncharacteristics of resistors mounted on your product rather than only depending on the calculated power \nlimit or steady-state conditions.\n5.If the resistors are to be used in high frequency circuits, carefully check the operation before use.  \nSuch circuits change the electrical characteristics of the resistors.\n6.\nperformance and reliability of the resistors.\n7.When soldering with a soldering iron, never touch the resistors'bodies with the tip of the soldering iron. \nWhen using a soldering iron with a high temperature tip, finish soldering as quickly as possible\n (within three seconds at 350 °C max.).\n8.Mounting of the resistors with excessive or insufficient wetting amount of solder may affect the \nconnection reliability or the performance of the resistors.  Carefully check the effects and apply a proper \namount of solder for use.\n9.When the resistors' protective coatings are chipped, flawed, or removed, the characteristics of the \nresistors may be impaired. Take special care not to apply mechanical shock during automatic mounting\nor cause damage during handling of the boards with the resistors mounted.\n10. Do not apply shock to the resistors or pinch them with a hard tool (e.g. pliers and tweezers). Otherwise, \nthe resistors' protective coatings and bodies may be chipped, affecting their performance.\n11.
