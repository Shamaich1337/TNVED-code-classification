#### Description:
The 4-inch GaAs wafer S-I undoped is a semiconductor substrate made from Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) that is undoped, meaning it does not contain intentional impurities to alter its electrical properties. This type of wafer is classified as semi-insulating, which makes it suitable for high-frequency and high-power applications due to its low electrical conductivity.

#### Typical Applications:
- **High-Frequency Devices:** Used in the fabrication of microwave and millimeter-wave devices, such as amplifiers and oscillators.
- **Optoelectronics:** Suitable for applications in photonic devices, including lasers and photodetectors.
- **RF and Microwave Circuits:** Commonly utilized in RF (radio frequency) and microwave integrated circuits (ICs) for telecommunications and radar systems.
- **Power Electronics:** Employed in power amplifiers and other components that require efficient power management.

This GaAs wafer is particularly valuable in advanced electronic applications where performance, efficiency, and thermal management are critical.
