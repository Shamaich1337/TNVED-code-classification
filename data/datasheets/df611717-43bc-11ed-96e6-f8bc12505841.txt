This switch is designed on a submicron \nprocess that provides low power dissipation yet gives high \nswitching speed, low on resistance, and low leakage currents. \nThe ADG779 operates from a single supply range of 1.8 V to \n5.5 V , making it ideal for use in battery-powered instruments \nand with the new generation of DACs and ADCs from Analog \nDevices, Inc. \nEach switch of the ADG779 conducts equally well in both \ndirections when on. The ADG779 exhibits break-before-make \nswitching action. \nBecause of the advanced submicron process, −3 dB bandwidth \nof greater than 200 MHz can be achieved. \nThe ADG779 is available in a 6-lead SC70 package. PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Tiny 6-Lead SC70 Package. \n2. 1.8 V to 5.5 V Single-Supply Operation. The ADG779 \noffers high performance, including low on resistance and \nfast switching times, and is fully specified and guaranteed with 3 V and 5 V supply rails. \n3. Ver y Low R ON (5 Ω max at 5 V , 10 Ω max at 3 V). At 1.8 V \noperation, R ON is typically 40 Ω over the temperature range. \n4. On-Resistance Flatness (R FLAT (ON) ) (0.75 Ω typ). \n5. −3 dB Bandwidth > 200 MHz. \n6. Low Power Dissipation. CMOS construction ensures low power dissipation. \n7. 14 ns Switching Times. \n \n \nADG779  \n \nRev.
