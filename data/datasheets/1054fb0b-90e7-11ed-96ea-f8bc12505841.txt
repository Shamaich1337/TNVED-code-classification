ADP7182  with Adjustable Output Voltage, V OUT = −5 V \n \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADP7182  is a CMOS, low dropout (LDO) linear regulator \nthat operates from −2.7 V to −28 V and provides up to −200 mA \nof output current. This high input voltage LDO is ideal for regu-lation of high performance analog and mixed signal circuits operating from −27 V down to −1.2 V rails. Using an advanced proprietary architecture, it provides high power supply rejection and low noise, and achieves excellent line and load transient response with a small 2.2 μF ceramic output capacitor. \nThe ADP7182  is available in fixed output voltage and an \nadjustable version that allows the output voltage to range from \n−1.22 V to −V\nIN + V DO via an external feedback divider.  The following fixed output voltages are available from stock: −5 V \n(3 mm × 3 mm LFCSP), −1.8 V , −2.5 V , −3 V , −5 V (TSOT), −1.2 V , \n−1.5 V , −2.5 V , −5 V (2.00 mm × 2.00 mm LFCSP). Additional \nvoltages are available by special order. \nThe ADP7182  regulator output noise is 18 μV rms independent \nof the output voltage. The enable logic is capable of interfacing \nwith positive or negative logic levels for maximum flexibility. \nThe ADP7182  is available in 5-lead TSOT, 6- and 8-lead LFCSP \npackages for a small, low profile footprint. \n \nADP7182 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Operation beyond \nthe maximum operating conditions for extended periods may \naffect product reliability. \nTHERMAL DATA \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in \ncombination. The ADP7182  can be damaged when the junction \ntemperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature \ndoes not guarantee that junction temperature (T J) is within the \nspecified temperature limits. In applications with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature may have to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low printed \ncircuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature can exceed the maximum limit as long as the junction temperature is within specification limits. The T\nJ of the device is \ndependent on the ambient temperature (T A), the power dissipation \nof the device (P D), and the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance \nof the package (θ JA).  \nMaximum T J is calculated from the T A and P D using the formula  \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) \nJunction-to-ambient thermal resistance (θ JA) of the package is \nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4-layer board. The junction-to-ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent \non the application and board layout.  \n  In applications where high maximum power dissipation exists, \nclose attention to thermal board design is required. The value of θ\nJA can vary, depending on PCB material, layout, and environ-\nmental conditions. The specified values of θ JA are based on a \n4-layer, 4 in. × 3 in. circuit board.

Ψ JB of the package is based on modeling and \ncalculation using a 4-layer board. The JESD51-12, Guidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information , states \nthat thermal characterization parameters are not the same as thermal resistances. Ψ\nJB measures the component power flowing \nthrough multiple thermal paths rather than a single path as in \nthermal resistance, θ JB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths include \nconvection from the top of the package as well as radiation from \nthe package, factors that make Ψ JB more useful in real-world \napplications.

M | Page 22 of 32 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADP7182  is a low quiescent current, LDO linear regulator \nthat operates from −2.7 V to −28 V and can provide up to −200 mA \nof output current. Drawing a low −650 μA of quiescent current (typical) at full load makes the ADP7182  ideal for battery-powered \nportable equipment. Maximum shutdown current consumption \nis −8 μA at room temperature. \nOptimized for use with small 2.2 μF ceramic capacitors, the \nADP7182  provides excellent transient performance.  \nVOUTGND\nEN\nVINREFERENCE\nSHUTDOWNSHORT\nCIRCUIT\nTHERMAL\nPROTECTVREG\n10703-075 \nFigure 77.

Adjustable Output Voltage Internal Block Diagram  \nInternally, the ADP7182  consists of a reference, an error amplifier, \na feedback voltage divider, and an NMOS pass transistor. Output \ncurrent is delivered via the NMOS pass transistor, which is controlled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback voltage from the output \nand amplifies the difference. If the feedback voltage is more positive \nthan the reference voltage, the gate of the NMOS transistor is pulled toward GND, allowing more current to pass and increasing the output voltage. If the feedback  voltage is more negative than \nthe reference voltage, the gate of the NMOS transistor is pulled \ntoward −V\nIN, allowing less current to pass and decreasing the \noutput voltage.  \nThe ESD protection devices are shown in the block diagram as \nZener diodes (see Figure 77 and Figure 78). ADJUSTABLE MODE OPERATION \nThe ADP7182  is available in a fixed output voltage and an \nadjustable mode version with an output voltage that can be set \nto between −1.22 V and −27 V by an external voltage divider. The \noutput voltage can be set according to  \n−V OUT = −1.22 V (1 + RFB1/RFB2) \nwhere R FB1 and R FB2 are the resistors in the output voltage \ndivider, as shown in Figure 79. \nRFB2 must be less than 120 kΩ to minimize the output voltage errors \ndue to the leakage current of the ADJ pin. The error voltage caused \nby the ADJ pin leakage current is the parallel combination of R FB1 \nand R FB2 times the ADJ pin leakage current. \nFor example, when R FB1 = R FB2 = 120 kΩ, the output voltage is \n−2.44 V and the error due to the typical ADJ pin leakage current (10 nA) is 60 kΩ times 10 nA, or 0.6 mV . This example results \nin an output voltage error of 0.0245%. \nThe addition of a small capacitor (~100 pF) in parallel with \nR\nFB1 can improve the stability of the ADP7182 . Larger values of \ncapacitance also reduce the noise and improve PSRR (see the \nNoise Reduction of the Adjustable section). \n \nRFB2\n120kΩ\nRFB1\n120kΩGND\nEN ADJVIN VOUT\nADP7182 ON\nON–2VOFF 0V2VVIN = –3V VOUT = –2.44VCOUT\n2.2µFCIN\n2.2µF\n10703-077 \nFigure 79.

For more information about, and to obtain \nADIsimPower  design tools, visit www.analog.com/ADIsimPower . \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nOutput Capacitor \nThe ADP7182  is designed for operation with small space-saving \nceramic capacitors; however, it functions with most commonly \nused capacitors as long as care is taken with regard to the ESR value. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the stability of the \nLDO control loop. A minimum of 2.2 μF capacitance with an \nESR of 0.2 Ω or less is recommended to ensure the stability of the ADP7182 . Transient response to changes in load current is \nalso affected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient response of the ADP7182  \nto large changes in load current. Figure 80 shows the transient \nresponses for an output capacitance value of 2.2 μF. \nCH1  100mABW CH2  50mVBWM40µs A  CH1      –122mA\nT  10.60%12T\n10703-078VOUT\nLOAD CURRENT\n \nFigure 80. Output Transient Response, C OUT = 2.2 μF \nInput Bypass Capacitor \nConnecting a 2.2 μF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the \ncircuit sensitivity to PCB layout, especially when long input \ntraces or high source impedance are encountered. When more than 2.2 μF of output capacitance is required, increase the input \ncapacitance to match it. \nInput and Output Capacitor Properties \nAs long as they meet the minimum capacitance and maximum \nESR requirements, any good quality ceramic capacitors can be \nused with the ADP7182 . Ceramic capacitors are manufactured \nwith a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature and applied voltage.  Capacitors must have a dielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over the necessary temperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of 25 V or 50 V are recommended. Due to their poor temperature and dc \nbias characteristics, Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are not \nrecommended.  \nFigure 81 depicts the capacitance vs. voltage bias characteristics \nof a 0805, 2.2 μF , 25 V , X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a capacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage rating exhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the \nX5R dielectric is ~ ±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature \nrange and is not a function of package or voltage rating. \n2.5\n00.51.01.52.0\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30CAPACITANCE (µF)\nDC BIAS (V)\n10703-079 \nFigure 81.

TEMPCO  is the worst-case capacitor temperature coefficient. \nTOL  is the worst-case component tolerance. \nIn this example, the worst-case temperature coefficient (TEMPCO) over −40°C to +85°C is 15% for an X5R dielectric. The tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is 10%, and the C\nBIAS is 2.08 μF at a 3 V bias, \nas shown in Figure 81. \nSubstituting these values in Equation 1 yields \nCEFF = 2.08 μF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 1.59 μF \nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the \nminimum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temperature and tolerance at the chosen output voltage of −3 V .  \nTo guarantee the performance of the ADP7182, it is imperative \nthat the effects of dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on the \nbehavior of the capacitors be evaluated for each application. \nADP7182 Data Sheet\n \nRev. M | Page 24 of 32 ENABLE PIN OPERATION \nThe ADP7182  uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT pin \nunder normal operating conditions. When EN is at ±2 V with \nrespect to GND, VOUT turns on, and when EN is at 0 V , VOUT turns off. For automatic startup, EN can be connected to VIN. \nWhen the device is disabled, a ~220 kΩ resistor connects to the \nVOUT pin, which pulls the VOUT pin up to GND. \nThe ADP7182  provides a dual polarity enable pin (EN) that turns \non the LDO when |V\nEN| ≥ 2 V .

M | Page 25 of 32 NOISE REDUCTION OF THE ADJUSTABLE ADP7182  \nThe ultralow output noise of the fixed output ADP7182  is achieved \nby keeping the LDO error amplifier in unity gain and setting the \nreference voltage equal to the output  voltage. This architecture does \nnot work for an adjustable output voltage LDO. The adjustable \noutput ADP7182  uses the more conventional architecture where \nthe reference voltage is fixed and the error amplifier gain is a function \nof the output voltage. The disadvantage of the conventional LDO architecture is that the output voltage noise is proportional to \nthe output voltage. \nThe adjustable LDO circuit can be modified slightly to reduce \nthe output voltage noise to levels close to that of the fixed output of the ADP7182 . The circuit shown in Figure 87 adds two additional \ncomponents to the output voltage setting resistor divider. C\nNR \nand R NR are added in parallel with R FB1 to reduce the ac gain of \nthe error amplifier. R NR is chosen to be nearly equal to R FB2; this \nlimits the ac gain of the error amplifier to approximately 6 dB. The actual gain is the parallel combination of R\nNR and R FB1 divided \nby R FB2. This resistance ensures that the error amplifier always \noperates at greater than unity gain. \nCNR is chosen by setting the reactance of C NR equal to R FB1 − R NR \nat a frequency between 10 Hz and 100 Hz. This capacitance sets \nthe frequency where the ac gain of the error amplifier is 3 dB down \nfrom the dc gain. \nRFB2\n13kΩ\nRFB1\n147kΩGND\nEN ADJVIN VOUT\nADP7182 ON\nON–2VOFF 0V2VVIN = –16V VOUT = –15VCOUT\n2.2µF\nCNR\n100nFCIN\n2.2µFRNR\n13kΩ\n10703-085 \nFigure 87. Noise Reduction Modification to Adjustable LDO \nThe noise of the adjustable LDO is found by using the following \nformula, assuming the noise of a fixed output LDO is \napproximately 18 μV:  \nNoise  = 18 μV × ( RPAR + R FB2) ÷ RFB2 \nwhere RPAR is a parallel combination of RFB1 and R NR.  \nBased on the component values shown in Figure 87, the ADP7182  \nhas the following characteristics: \n\uf0b7 DC gain of 12.3 (21.8 dB) \n\uf0b7 3 dB roll-off frequency of 10.8 Hz \n\uf0b7 High frequency ac gain of 1.92 (5.67 dB) \n\uf0b7 Noise reduction factor of 6.41 (16.13 dB) \n\uf0b7 Measured rms noise of the adjustable LDO at −200 mA \nwithout noise reduction of 220 μV rms \n\uf0b7 Measured rms noise of the adjustable LDO at −200 mA \nwith noise reduction circuit of 35 μV rms  \n\uf0b7 Calculated rms noise of the adjustable LDO with noise \nreduction (assuming 18 μV rms for fixed voltage option) of 34.5 μV rms The noise of the LDO is approximately the noise of the fixed output LDO (typically 18 μV rms) times the high frequency ac gain.

The ADP7182  is designed to limit current when the \noutput load reaches −350 mA (typical). When the output load exceeds −350 mA, the output voltage is reduced to maintain a constant current limit.  \nThermal overload protection is included, which limits the junction \ntemperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme conditions (that is, high ambient temperature and power dissipation) when the junction temperature starts to rise above 150°C, the output is turned off, reducing the output current to 0 mA. When the junction temperature falls below 135°C, the \noutput is turned on again, and the output current is restored to \nthe nominal value. \nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to ground \noccurs. At first, the ADP7182  limits current so that only −350 mA \nis conducted into the short. If self-heating of the junction is great enough to cause the temperature to rise above 150°C, thermal shutdown is activated, turning off the output and reducing the \noutput current to 0 mA. As the junction temperature cools and \nfalls below 135°C, the output turns on and conducts − 350 mA \ninto the short, again causing the junction temperature to rise above 150°C. This thermal oscillation between 135°C and 150°C \nADP7182 Data Sheet\nRev. M | Page 26 of 32 causes a current oscillation between −350 mA and 0 mA that \ncontinues as long as the short remains at the output. \nCurrent-limit and thermal overload protections are intended to \nprotect the device against accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation, device power dissipation must be externally \nlimited so that the junction temperatures do not exceed 125°C. \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS \nIn most applications, the ADP7182  does not dissipate much heat \ndue to the high efficiency. However, in applications with high \nambient temperature, and high supply voltage to output voltage \ndifferential, the heat dissipated in the package is large enough that it can cause the junction temperature of the die to exceed the \nmaximum junction temperature of 125°C.  \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter \nenters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction \ntemperature has decreased below 135°C to prevent any permanent \ndamage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application \nis important to guarantee reliable performance over all conditions. The junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient temperature of the environment and the temperature rise of the \npackage due to the power dissipation, as shown in Equation 3. \nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the \nADP7182  must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the junction \ntemperature stays below this maximum value, the user must be aware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature changes. These parameters include ambient temperature, power dissipation in the power device, and thermal resistances between the junction and ambient air (θ\nJA). The θ JA number is dependent \non the package assembly compounds that are used, and the amount \nof copper that solders the package VIN pins to the PCB. \nTable 8 and Ta ble 9 show t ypical θ JA values of th e 6- and 8-lead \nand 5-lead TSOT packages for various PCB copper sizes. \nTable 10 shows the typical Ψ JB value s of the 6- and 8-lead and \n5-lead TSOT. \nTable 8.

Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies to  \nTJ = TA + {[( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD] × θJA} (5)\nA\ns shown in Equation 5, for a given ambient temperature, input-to-\noutput voltage differential, and continuous load current, there exists a minimum copper size requirement for the PCB to ensure that the junction temperature does not rise above 125°C. Figure 89 to Figure 97 show junction temperature calculations for different ambient temperatures, power dissipation, and areas of PCB copper. \nHeat dissipation from the package can be improved by increasing \nthe amount of copper attached to the pins of the ADP7182 . \nAdding thermal planes under the package also improves thermal \nperformance. However, as listed in Table 8 and Table 9, a point of diminishing returns is reached eventually, beyond which an increase in the copper area does not yield significant reduction in the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance. \n140\n120100\n80604020\n0\n01 .2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2JUNCTION TEMPERATURE, TJ (°C)\nTOTAL POWER DISSIPATION (W)6400mm2\n1000mm 2\n500mm2\n100mm 2\n25mm2\nJEDEC\nTJ MAX\n10703-087\nFig\nure 89.
