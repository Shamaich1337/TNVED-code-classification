The AD8038 single amplifier in the 8-lead SOIC package has a disable feature. Despite being low power and low cost, the amplifier provides excellent overall performance. Additionally, it offers a high slew rate of 425 V/μs and a low input offset voltage of 3 mV maximum. \nThe Analog Devices, Inc., proprietary XFCB process allows low \nnoise operation (8 nV/√Hz and 600 fA/√Hz) at extremely low \nquiescent currents. Given a wide supply voltage range (3 V to 12 V), \nwide bandwidth, and small packaging, the AD8038 and AD8039 amplifiers are designed to work in a variety of applications \nwhere power and space are at a premium. \nThe AD8038 and AD8039 amplifiers have a wide input common-\nmode range of 1 V from either rail and swing to within 1 V of each \nrail on the output. These amplifiers are optimized for driving \ncapacitive loads up to 15 pF. If driving larger capacitive loads, a small \nseries resistor is needed to avoid excessive peaking or overshoot. \n The AD8039 amplifier is available in a 8-lead SOT-23 package, \nand the single AD8038 is available in both an 8-lead SOIC and a \n5-lead SC70 package. These amplifiers are rated to work over \nthe industrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C. \n–6\n1000 0.1 1 10 100–303691215182124\nFREQUENCY (MHz)GAIN (dB)G = +5\nG = +2\nG = +1G = +10\n02951-004 \nFigure 4.

This is a stress \nrating only; functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute \nmaximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect \ndevice reliability. \nMAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION \nThe maximum safe power dissipation in the AD8038/AD8039 \npackage is limited by the associated rise in junction temperature \n(TJ) on the die. The plastic encapsulating the die locally reaches \nthe junction temperature. At approximately 150°C, which is the glass transition temperature, the plastic changes its properties. \nEven temporarily exceeding this temperature limit may change \nthe stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric performance of the AD8038/AD8039. Exceeding a junction temperature of 175°C for an extended time can result in changes in the silicon devices, potentially \ncausing failure. \nThe still-air thermal properties of the package and PCB (θ\nJA), \nambient temperature (T A), and total power dissipated in the \npackage (P D) determine the junction temperature of the die. \nThe junction temperature can be calculated as  \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) \nThe power dissipated in the package (P D) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the \npackage due to the load drive for all outputs. The quiescent power is the voltage between the supply pins (V\nS) multiplied by the \nquiescent current (I S). Assuming the load (R L) is referenced to \nmidsupply, then the total drive power is V S/2 × I OUT, some of which \nis dissipated in the package and some in the load (V OUT × I OUT). \nThe difference between the total drive power and the load \npower is the drive power dissipated in the package.  \nPD = quiescent power  + (total drive power − load power ) \nPD = [VS × IS] + [( VS/2) × (V OUT/RL)] − [ VOUT2/RL] AMBIENT TEMPERATURE (°C)0\n–55MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)1.0\n–25 5 35 65 95 1251.52.0\nSOIC-8\n0.5SC70-5SOT-23-8\n02951-005 \nFigure 5. Maximum Power Dissipation vs. Temperature for a 4-Layer Board \nRMS output voltages should be considered. If R L is referenced to \nVS−, as in single-supply operation, then the total drive power is \nVS × I OUT. If the rms signal levels are indeterminate, consider the \nworst case, when V OUT = V S /4 for R L to midsupply \nPD = (VS × IS) + (V S/4)2/RL \nIn single-supply operation with R L referenced to V S−, worst case \nis V OUT = V S /2. \nAirflow increases heat dissipation, effectively reducing θ JA. In \naddition, more metal directly in contact with the package leads \nfrom metal traces, throughholes, ground, and power planes reduce \nthe θ JA. Care must be taken to minimize parasitic capacitances at \nthe input leads of high speed op amps as discussed in the \nLayout, Grounding, and Bypassing Considerations  section. \nFigure 5  shows the maximum safe power dissipation in the \npackage vs. the ambient temperature for the 8-lead SOIC \n(125°C/W), 5-lead SC70 (210°C/W), and 8-lead SOT-23 \n(160°C/W) packages on a JEDEC standard 4-layer board.  \nθJA values are approximations. \nOUTPUT SHORT CIRCUIT \nShorting the output to ground or drawing excessive current \nfrom the AD8038/AD8039 will likely cause a catastrophic failure. \n \nESD CAUTION \n \n \n \n  \nAD8038/AD8039  \n \nRev.

G | Page 13 of 16 LAYOUT, GROUNDING, AND BY PASSING CONSIDERATIONS \nDISABLE \nThe AD8038 in the 8-lead SOIC package provides a disable \nfeature. This feature disables the input from the output (see \nFigure 42  for input-output isolation) and reduces the quiescent \ncurrent from typically 1 mA to 0.2 mA. When the DISABLE  \nnode is pulled below 4.5 V from the positive supply rail, the part \nbecomes disabled. To enable the part, the DISABLE  node needs \nto be pulled to greater than (V S – 2.5). \nPOWER SUPPLY BYPASSING \nPower supply pins are actually inputs, and care must be taken  \nso that a noise-free stable dc voltage is applied. The purpose of \nbypass capacitors is to create low impedances from the supply \nto ground at all frequencies, thereby shunting or filtering a \nmajority of the noise. \nDecoupling schemes are designed to minimize the bypassing \nimpedance at all frequencies with a parallel combination of capacitors. The 0.01 μF or 0.001 μF (X7R or NPO) chip capacitors \nare critical and should be placed as close as possible to the \namplifier package. Larger chip capacitors, such as 0.1 μF \ncapacitors, can be shared among a few closely spaced active \ncomponents in the same signal path. A 10 μF tantalum capacitor  is less critical for high frequency bypassing and, in most cases, \nonly one per board is needed at the supply inputs. \nGROUNDING \nA ground plane layer is important in densely packed PC boards \nto spread the current minimizing parasitic inductances. However, \nan understanding of where the current flows in a circuit is critical \nto implementing effective high speed circuit design. The length \nof the current path is directly proportional to the magnitude of parasitic inductances and, therefore, the high frequency impedance of the path. High speed currents in an inductive ground return \ncreate an unwanted voltage noise. \nThe length of the high frequency bypass capacitor leads is most \ncritical. A parasitic inductance in the bypass grounding works \nagainst the low impedance created by the bypass capacitor. Because \nload currents flow from the supplies as well, the ground for the \nload impedance should be at the same physical location as the bypass capacitor grounds. For the larger value capacitors, which are intended to be effective at lower frequencies, the current \nreturn path distance is less critical. INPUT CAPACITANCE \nAlong with bypassing and ground, high speed amplifiers can be \nsensitive to parasitic capacitance between the inputs and ground. A \nfew picofarads of capacitance reduces the input impedance at high frequencies, in turn increasing the gain of the amplifiers, \ncausing peaking of the frequency response, or even oscillations \nif severe enough. It is recommended that the external passive components that are connected to the input pins be placed as close as possible to the inputs to avoid parasitic capacitance. The ground and power planes must be kept at a distance of at \nleast 0.05 mm from the input pins on all layers of the board. \nOUTPUT CAPACITANCE \nTo a lesser extent, parasitic capacitances on the output can cause \npeaking of the frequency response. Two methods to minimize this effect include the following: \n• Put a small value resistor in series with the output to isolate \nthe load capacitor from the output stage of the amplifier, see \nFigure 12 , Figure 13 , Figure 27 , and Figure 28 . \n• Increase the phase margin with higher noise gains or add  \na pole with a parallel resistor and capacitor from −IN to the output. \nINPUT-TO-OUTPUT COUPLING \nThe input and output signal traces should not be parallel to \nminimize capacitive coupling between the inputs and outputs, \navoiding any positive feedback. \n   \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \nAD8038/AD8039  \n \nRev.

Schematic to Drive AD9203 with the AD8039  \nThe AD9203 is a low power (125 mW on a 5 V supply), 40 MSPS \n10-bit converter. As such, the low power, high performance \nAD8039 is an appropriate amplifier choice to drive it. \nIn low supply voltage applications, differential analog inputs  \nare needed to increase the dynamic range of the ADC inputs. Differential driving can also reduce second and other even-order \ndistortion products. The AD8039 can be used to make a dc-\ncoupled, single-ended-to-differential driver for driving these ADCs. Figure 43  is a schematic of such a circuit for driving the \nAD9203, 10-bit, 40 MSPS ADC. \nThe AD9203 works best when the common-mode voltage at the \ninput is at the midsupply or 2.5 V . The output stage design of \nthe AD8039 makes it ideal for driving these types of ADCs.  \nIn this circuit, one of the op amps is configured in the inverting \nmode, and the other is in the noninverting mode. However, to \nprovide better bandwidth matching, each op amp is configured \nfor a noise gain of +2. The inverting op amp is configured for a gain of −1, and the noninverting op amp is configured for a gain of +2. Each has a very similar ac response. The input signal to the noninverting op amp is divided by 2 to normalize its voltage level and make it equal to the inverting output. \nThe outputs of the op amps are centered at 2.5 V , which is the \nmidsupply level of the ADC. This is accomplished by first taking \nthe 2.5 V reference output of the ADC and dividing it by 2 with a pair of 1 kΩ resistors. The resulting 1.25 V is applied to the positive input of each op amp. This voltage is then multiplied by \nthe gain of the op amps to provide a 2.5 V level at each output. LOW POWER ACTIVE VIDEO FILTER \nSome composite video signals derived from a digital source \ncontain clock feedthrough that can limit picture quality. Active \nfilters made from op amps can be used in this application, but they consume 25 mW to 30 mW for each channel. In power-\nsensitive applications, this can be too much, requiring the use  \nof passive filters that can create impedance matching problems \nwhen driving any significant load. \nThe AD8038 can be used to make an effective low-pass active \nfilter that consumes one-fifth of the power consumed by an active filter made from an op amp. Figure 44  shows a circuit \nthat uses a AD8038 with ±2.5 V supplies to create a three-pole Sallen-Key filter. This circuit uses a single RC pole in front of a \nstandard 2-pole active section. \n0.1µF+2.5V\n10µF\n–2.5V0.1µF 10µFC3\n33pFR3\n49.9ΩRF\n1Ω680pF\nR575ΩR2\n499Ω\nC1100pFR1\n200Ω\nR449.9ΩAD8038\nVINVOUT\n02951-044 \nFigure 44.
