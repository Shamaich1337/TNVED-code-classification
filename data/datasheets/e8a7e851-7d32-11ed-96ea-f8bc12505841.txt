It provides accurate, pin-selectable \ngains of −11 dB to +31 dB with a bandwidth of 90 MHz or +9 dB to \n51+ dB with a bandwidth of 9 MHz. Any intermediate gain \nrange may be arranged using one external resistor. The input referred noise spectral density is only 1.3 nV/√Hz, and power \nconsumption is 125 mW at the recommended ±5 V supplies. The decibel gain is linear in dB, accurately calibrated, and stable \nover temperature and supply. The gain is controlled at a high \nimpedance (50 MΩ), low bias (200 nA) differential input; the scaling is 25 mV/dB, requiring a gain control voltage of only 1 V to span the central 40 dB of the gain range. An overrange and underrange of 1 dB is provided whatever the selected range. The gain control response time is less than 1 μs for a 40 dB change. \nThe differential gain control interface allows the use of either \ndifferential or single-ended positive or negative control voltages. \nSeveral of these amplifiers may be cascaded and their gain \ncontrol gains offset to optimize the system SNR. \nThe AD603 can drive a load impedance as low as 100 Ω with \nlow distortion. For a 500 Ω load in shunt with 5 pF, the total harmonic distortion for a ±1 V sinusoidal output at 10 MHz is typically −60 dBc. The peak specified output is ±2.5 V minimum into a 500 Ω load. \nThe AD603 uses a patented proprietary circuit topology—the \nX-AMP®. The X-AMP comprises a variable attenuator of 0 dB \nto −42.14 dB followed by a fixed-gain amplifier. Because of the attenuator, the amplifier never has to cope with large inputs and can use negative feedback to define its (fixed) gain and dynamic performance. The attenuator has an input resistance of 100 Ω, \nlaser trimmed to ±3%, and comprises a 7-stage R-2R ladder \nnetwork, resulting in an attenuation between tap points of 6.021 dB. A proprietary interpolation technique provides a \ncontinuous gain control function that is linear in dB.  \nThe AD603 is specified for operation from −40°C to +85°C. \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM \nSCALING\nREFERENCE\nVG\nGAIN-\nCONTROL\nINTERFACEAD603PRECISION PASSIVE\nINPUT ATTENUATORFIXED-GAIN\nAMPLIFIER\n*NOMINAL VALUES.R-2R LADDER NETWORKGPOS\nGNEG\nVINP\nCOMM0dB –6.02dB –12.04dB –18.06dB –24.08dB –30.1dB –36.12dB –42.14dB\nRR R R R R R\n2R 2R 2R 2R 2R 2R R20Ω*694Ω*6.44kΩ *VOUT\nFDBK\n00539-001 \nFigure 1. \nAD603 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

K | Page 12 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD603 comprises a fixed -gain amplifier, preceded by a \nbroadband passive  attenuator of 0 dB to 42.14 dB, having a gain \ncontrol scaling factor of 40 dB per volt. The fixed gain is laser -\ntrimmed in two ranges , to either 31.07 dB ( ×35.8) or 50 dB \n(×358), or it may be set to any range in between using one \nexternal resistor between  Pin 5 and Pin 7. Somewhat higher \ngain can be obtained by connecting the resistor from Pin 5 to \ncommon, but the increase in output offset voltage limits the \nmaximum gain to about 60 dB. For any given range, the bandwidth is independent of the voltage -contr olled gain. This \nsystem provides an  underrange and overrange of 1.07 dB in all \ncases; for example, the overall gain is −11.07 dB to +31.07 dB in the maximum bandwidth mode (Pin 5 and Pin 7 strapped).  \nThis X -AMP structure has many advantages over former \nmethods of gain control based on nonli near elements. Most \nimportantly, the fixed -gain amplifier can use negative feedback \nto increase its accuracy. Becaus e large inputs are first attenuated, \nthe amplifier input is always small. For example, to deliver a ±1 V output in the − 1 dB/+41 dB mode (th at is, using a fixed \namplifier gain of 41.07 dB) , its input is only 8.84 mV; th erefore , \nthe distortion can be very low. Equally important, the small -\nsignal gain and phase response, and thus the pulse response, are essentially independent of gain.  \nFigure 31 is a simplified schematic. The input attenuator is a  \n7-section R -2R ladder network, using untrimmed resistors of \nnominally R = 62.5 Ω, which results in a characteristic resistance  of \n125 Ω ± 20%. A shunt resistor is included at the input and laser \ntrimmed to establish a more exact input resistance of 100 Ω ± 3%, \nwhich ensures accurate operation (gain and HP corner fr equency) \nwhen used in conjunction with external resistors or capacitors.  \nThe nominal maximum signal at input VINP is 1 V rms (±1.4 V peak) when using the recommended ± 5 V supplies, \nalthough operation to ± 2 V peak is permissible with some \nincrease in HF dis tortion and feedthrough. Pin 4 (COMM) \nmust be connected directly to the input ground; significant impedance in this connection reduce s the gain accuracy.  \nThe signal applied at the input of the ladder network is attenuated by 6.02 dB by each section; th erefore, the attenuation to each of \nthe taps is progressively 0 dB, 6.02 dB, 12.04 dB, 18.06 dB, \n24.08 dB, 30.1 dB, 36.12 dB, and 42.14 dB. A unique circuit \ntechnique is employed to interpolate between these tap points, indicated by the slider in Figure 31, thus providing continuous \nattenuation  from 0 dB to 42.14 dB. It help s in understanding the \nAD603 to think in terms of a mechanical means for moving this slider from left to right; in fact, its position is controlled b y the \nvoltage between Pin 1 and Pin 2. The details of the gain control \ninterface are in the The Gain Control Interface  section .  The gain is at all times very exactly determined, and a linear -in-\ndB relationship is  automatically guaranteed by the exponential \nnature of the attenuation in the ladder network (the X -AMP \nprinciple). In practice, the gain deviates slightly from the ideal \nlaw, by about ± 0.2 dB peak (see, for example, Figure 5). \nNOISE PERFORMANCE  \nAn important advantage of the X -AMP is its superior noise \nperformance. The nominal resistance seen at inner tap points is 41.7 Ω (one third of 125 Ω), which exhibits a Johnson noise spectral density (NSD) of 0.83 nV/√Hz (that  is, √4kTR) at 27 °C, \nwhich is a large fraction of the total input noise. The first stage of the amplifier contributes a further 1 nV/√Hz, for a total input noise of 1.3 nV/√Hz. It is  apparent that it is essential to use a \nlow resistance in the ladder netwo rk to achieve the very low \nspecified noise level. The source impedance of the signal  \nforms a voltage divider with the 100 Ω input resistanc e of the \nAD603. In some applications, the resulting attenuation may  be unacceptable, requiring the use of an extern al buffer or \npreamplifier to match a high impedance source to the low impedance AD603.  \nThe noise at maximum gain (that is, at the 0 dB tap) depends on whether the input is short -circuited or open -circuited.  When \nshort -circuited , the minimum NSD of slightly  over 1 nV/√Hz is \nachieved . When open -circuited , the resistance of 100 Ω looking \ninto the first tap generates 1.29 nV/√Hz, so the noise increases to 1.63 nV/√Hz. (This last calculation would be important if the AD603 were preceded by, for example, a 900 Ω resistor to allow operation from inputs up to 10 V rms.) As the selected tap \nmoves away from the input, the dependence of the noise on \nsource impedance quickly diminishes.  \nApart from the small variations just discussed, the signal- to-\nnoise (SN R) at the out put is essentially independent of the \nattenuator setting. For example, on the −11 dB/+31 dB range, the fixed gain of × 35.8 raises the output NSD to 46.5 nV/√Hz. \nTherefore , for the maximum undistorted output of 1 V rms and \na 1 MHz bandwidth, the output SN R would be 86.6 dB, that is, \n20 log(1 V/46.5 µ V). \n \nData Sheet   AD603\n \nRev.

Simplified Block Diagram \nTHE GAIN CONTROL INTERFACE \nThe attenuation is controlled through a differential, high \nimpedance (50 MΩ) input, with a scaling factor that is laser-\ntrimmed to 40 dB per volt, that is, 25 mV/dB. An internal band gap reference ensures stability of the scaling with respect to \nsupply and temperature variations. \nWhen the differential input voltage V\nG = 0 V , the attenuator \nslider is centered, providing an attenuation of 21.07 dB. For the \nmaximum bandwidth range, this results in an overall gain of \n10 dB (= −21.07 dB + 31.07 dB). When the control input is \n−500 mV , the gain is lowered by +20 dB (= 0.500 V × 40 dB/V) to −10 dB; when set to +500 mV , the gain is increased by +20 dB to +30 dB. When this interface is overdriven in either direction, the gain approaches either −11.07 dB (= − 42.14 dB + \n+31.07 dB) or 31.07 dB (= 0 + 31.07 dB), respectively. The only \nconstraint on the gain control voltage is that it be kept within the common-mode range (−1.2 V to +2.0 V assuming +5 V \nsupplies) of the gain control interface. \nThe basic gain of the AD603 can therefore be calculated by \nGain (dB) = 40 V\nG +10 (1) \nwhere VG is in volts. When Pin 5 and Pin 7 are strapped (see the \nProgramming the Fixed-Gain Amplifier Using Pin Strapping \nsection), the gain becomes \nGain (dB) = 40 VG + 20 for  0 to  +40 dB \nand \nGain (dB) = 40 VG + 30 for  +10 to +50 dB (2) \nThe high impedance gain control input ensures minimal \nloading when driving many amplifiers in multiple channel  or cascaded applications. The differential capability provides flexibility in choosing the appropriate signal levels and polarities for various control schemes. For example, if the gain is to be controlled by a DAC providing a positive-only, ground-referenced output, the gain control low (GNEG) pin should be biased to a fixed offset of 500 mV to set the gain to −10 dB when gain control high (GPOS) is at zero, \nand to 30 dB when at 1.00 V . \nIt is a simple matter to include a voltage divider to achieve other \nscaling factors. When using an 8-bit DAC having an FS output \nof 2.55 V (10 mV/bit), a divider ratio of 2 (generating 5 mV/bit) \nresults in a gain-setting resolution of 0.2 dB/bit. The use of such offsets is valuable when two AD603s are cascaded, when various options exist for optimizing the signal-to-noise profile, \nas is shown in the Sequential Mode (Optimal SNR) section, \nPROGRAMMING THE FIXED-GAIN AMPLIFIER \nUSING PIN STRAPPING \nAccess to the feedback network is provided at Pin 5 (FDBK). \nThe user may program the gain of the output amplifier of the \nAD603 using this pin, as shown in Figure 32, Figure 33, and Figure 34. There are three modes: in the default mode, FDBK  is unconnected, providing the range +9 dB/+51 dB; when V\nOUT \nand FDBK are shorted, the gain is lowered to −11 dB/+31 dB; \nand, when an external resistor is placed between V OUT and \nFDBK, any intermediate gain can be achieved, for example, \n−1 dB/+41 dB.

K | Page 15 of 24 USING THE AD603 IN CASCADE \nTwo or more AD603s can be connected in series to achieve \nhigher gain. Invariably, ac coupling must be used to prevent the dc offset voltage at the output of each amplifier from overloading the following amplifier at maximum gain. The required high-\npass coupling network is usually just a capacitor, chosen to set \nthe desired corner frequency in conjunction with the well-\ndefined 100 Ω input resistance of the following amplifier. \nFor two AD603s, the total gain control range becomes 84 dB \n(2 × 42.14 dB); the overall −3 dB bandwidth of cascaded stages is somewhat reduced. Depending on the pin strapping, the gain and bandwidth for two cascaded amplifiers can range from \n−22 dB to +62 dB (with a bandwidth of about 70 MHz) to \n+22 dB to +102 dB (with a bandwidth of about 6 MHz). \nThere are several ways of connecting the gain control inputs  \nin cascaded operation. The choice depends on whether it is important to achieve the highest possible instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (ISNR), or, alternatively, to minimize the ripple  in the gain error. The following examples feature the AD603 \nprogrammed for maximum bandwidth; the explanations apply \nto other gain/bandwidth combinations with appropriate \nchanges to the arrangements for setting the maximum gain. \nSEQUENTIAL MODE (OPTIMAL SNR) \nIn the sequential mode of operation, the ISNR is maintained at  \nits highest level for as much of the gain control range as possible. Figure 37 shows the SNR over a gain range of −22 dB to +62 dB, assuming an output of 1 V rms and a 1 MHz bandwidth. Figure 38, Figure 39, and Figure 40 show the general connections to accomplish this. Here, both the positive gain control inputs \n(GPOS) are driven in parallel by a positive-only, ground-referenced \nsource with a range of 0 V to 2 V , while the negative gain control inputs (GNEG) are biased by stable voltages to provide the needed gain offsets. These voltages may be provided by \nresistive dividers operating from a common voltage reference. \n00539-035 VC (V)2.2 –0.2 0.6 0.2 1.4 1.0 1.8SNR (dB)90\n8085\n7075\n65\n5560\n50\n \nFigure 37.

K | Page 16 of 24 The gains are offset (Figure 41) such that the gain of A2 is \nincreased only after the gain of A1 has reached its maximum value. Note that for a differential input of –600 mV or less, the gain of a single amplifier (A1 or A2) is at its minimum value of \n−11.07 dB; for a differential input of 600 mV or more, the gain \nis at its maximum value of 31.07 dB. Control inputs beyond these limits do not affect the gain and can be tolerated without damage or foldover in the response. This is an important aspect of the gain control response of the AD603. (See the Specifications \nsection for more details on the allowable voltage range.) The \ngain is now \nGain  (dB) = 40 V\nG + GO (3) \nwhere: \nVG is the applied control voltage. \nGO is determined by the gain range chosen.  \nIn the explanatory notes that follow, it is assumed that  the maximum bandwidth connections are used, for which  \nG\nO is −20 dB. \n+31.07dB\n+10dB A1 A2+31.07dB +28.96dB\n–11.07dB\n–11.07dB\n0.473 1.526–8.93dB\n0\n–200.5\n01.0\n201.50\n402.0\n60VC (V)\n62.14 –22.14GAIN\n(dB)\n*GAIN OFFSET OF 1.07dB, OR 26.75 mV.\n00539-039*\n*\n \nFigure 41. Explanation of Offset Calibration for Sequential Control \nWith reference to Figure 38, Figure 39, and Figure 40, note that \nVG1 refers to the differential gain control input to A1, and V G2 \nrefers to the differential gain control input to A2. When V G is \n0 V , V G1 = −473 mV and thus the gain of A1 is −8.93 dB (recall \nthat the gain of each individual amplifier in the maximum bandwidth mode is –10 dB for V\nG = −500 mV and 10 dB for V G \n= 0 V); meanwhile, V G2 = −1.908 V so the gain of A2 is pinned \nat −11.07 dB. The overall gain is therefore –20 dB (see Figure 38). \nWhen V G = 1.00 V , V G1 = 1.00 V − 0.473 V = 0.526 V , which sets \nthe gain of A1 to nearly its maximum value of +31.07 dB, while \nVG2 = 1.00 V − 1.526 V = 0.526 V , which sets the gain of A2 to \nnearly its minimum value of −11.07 dB. Close analysis shows that the degree to which neither AD603 is completely pushed to its maximum nor minimum gain exactly cancels in the overall \ngain, which is now 20 dB (see Figure 39). \nWhen V\nG = 2.0 V , the gain of A1 is pinned at 31.07 dB and that \nof A2 is near its maximum value of 28.93 dB, resulting in an \noverall gain of 60 dB (see Figure 40). This mode of operation is \nfurther clarified in Figure 42, which is a plot of the separate \ngains of A1 and A2 and the overall gain vs. the control voltage. Figure 43 is a plot of the SNR of the cascaded amplifiers vs. the \ncontrol voltage.

Alternatively, \nthe GNEG pins may be connected to an offset voltage of 0.500 V , in which case G\nO is −20 dB.  \nThe amplitude of the gain ripple in this case is also doubled, as shown in  Figure 45, while the ISNR  at the output of A2 now \ndecreases linearly as the gain increases, as shown in Figure 46. 00539-043 VC (V)2.2 –0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 1.0 1.2 0.8 1.6 1.8 2.0 1.4GAIN ERROR (dB)2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n–0.5–1.0–1.5–2.0\n \nFigure 45.

By offsetting the gains of A1 and A2 by half the period of the ripple, that is, by 3 dB, the residual gain errors of the two amplifiers can be made to cancel.

K | Page 18 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nA LOW NOISE AGC AMPLIFIER \nFigure 49 shows the ease with which the AD603 can be \nconnected as an AGC amplifier. The circuit illustrates many of \nthe points previously discussed: it uses few parts, has linear-in-dB gain, operates from a single supply, uses two cascaded amplifiers \nin sequential gain mode for maximum SNR, and an external \nresistor programs each gain of the amplifier. It also uses a \nsimple temperature-compensated detector. \nThe circuit operates from a single 10 V supply. Resistors R1, R2, \nR3, and R4 bias the common pins of A1 and A2 at 5 V . The common pin is a low impedance point and must have a low impedance path to ground, provided here by the 100 μF tantalum \ncapacitors and the 0.1 μF ceramic capacitors. \nThe cascaded amplifiers operate in sequential gain. Here, the \noffset voltage between Pin 2 (GNEG) of A1 and A2 is 1.05 V \n(42.14 dB × 25 mV/dB), provided by a voltage divider consisting of Resistors R5, R6, and R7. Using standard values, the offset is not \nexact, but it is not critical for this application. \nThe gain of both A1 and A2 is programmed by Resistors R13 \nand R14, respectively, to be about 42 dB; therefore, the maximum gain of the circuit is twice that, or 84 dB. The gain control range \ncan be shifted up by as much as 20 dB by appropriate choices of \nR13 and R14. The circuit operates as follows: \n\uf0b7 A1 and A2 are cascaded.  \n\uf0b7 Capacitor C1 and the 100 Ω of resistance at the input of A1 \nform a time constant of 10 μs.  \n\uf0b7 C2 blocks the small dc offset voltage at the output of A1 \n(which might otherwise saturate A2 at its maximum gain) and introduces a high-pass corner at about 16 kHz, \neliminating low frequency noise. \nA half-wave detector is used, based on Q1 and R8. The current \ninto capacitor, C\nAV, is the difference between the collector \ncurrent of Q2 (biased to be 300 μA at 300 K, 27°C) and the \ncollector current of Q1, which increases with the amplitude  \nof the output signal.  \nThe automatic gain control voltage, V AGC, is the time integral  \nof this error current. For V AGC (and thus the gain) to remain \ninsensitive to short-term amplitude fluctuations in the output \nsignal, the rectified current in Q1 must, on average, exactly balance the current in Q2.

K | Page 19 of 24 During the time VOUT is negative with respect to the base \nvoltage of Q1, Q1 conducts; when VOUT is positive, it is cut off. \nBecaus e the average collector current of Q1 is forced to be \n300 µA, and the square wave has a duty cycle of 1:1, Q1’s \ncollector current when conducting must be 600 µ A. With R8 \nomitted, the peak amplitude of VOUT is forced to be just the VBE \nof Q1 at 600 µA, typically about 700 mV , or 2 VBE peak -to-peak. \nThis voltage, the amplitude at which the output stabilizes, has a \nstrong negative temperature coefficient (TC), typically −1.7  mV/ °C. \nAlthough this may not be troublesome in some applications, the correct value of R8 render s the output s table with temperature.  \nTo understand this, note that the current in Q2 is made to be proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT). For the moment, continue to assume that the signal is a square wave.  \nWhen Q1 is conducting, V\nOUT is now the sum of VBE and a \nvoltage that is PTAT and that can be chosen to have an equal but opposite TC to that of the V\nBE. This is actually nothing more \nthan an application of the band gap voltage reference principle. When R8 is chosen such that the sum of the voltage across it \nand the V\nBE of Q1 is close to the band gap voltage of about 1.2 V , \nVOUT is stable over a wide range of temperatures, provided, of \ncourse, that Q1 and Q2 share the same thermal environment.  \nBecaus e the average emitter current is 600 µ A during each half \ncycle o f the square wave, a resistor of 833 Ω add s a PTAT \nvoltage of 500 mV at 300 K, increasing by 1.66 mV/ °C. In \npractice, the optimum value depend s on the type of transistor \nused and, to a lesser extent, on the waveform for which the \ntemperature stability is t o be optimized; for the inexpensive \n2N3904/2N3906 pair and sine wave signals, the recommended value is 806 Ω.  This resistor also serves to lower the peak current in Q1 when \nmore typical signals (usually sinusoidal) are involved, and the \n1.8 kHz LP filter it forms with C\nAV helps to minimize distortion \ndue to ripple in VAGC. Note that the output amplitude under sine \nwave conditions is  higher than for a square wave because  the \naverage value of the current for an ideal rectifier is  0.637 times \nas large, causin g the output amplitude to be 1.88 (=  1.2/0.637) V , \nor 1.33 V rms. In practice, the somewhat nonidea l rectifier \nresults in the sine -wave output being regulated to about \n1.4 V rms, or 3.6 V p -p. \nThe bandwidth of the circuit exceeds 40 MHz. At 10.7 MHz, the AGC threshold is 100 µ V (−67 dBm) and its maximum gain is \n83 dB (20 log 1.4 V/100 µ V). The circuit holds its output at \n1.4 V rms for inputs as low as −67 dBm to +15 dBm (82 dB), \nwhere the input signal exceeds the maximum input rating  of the \nAD603. For a 30 dBm input at 10.7 MHz, the second harmonic is 34 dB down from the fundamental , and the third harmonic is \n35 dB down  from the fundamental . \nCAUTION  \nCareful component selection, circuit layout, power supply \ndecoupling, and shielding are needed to minimize the  susceptibility  \nof the AD603 to interference from signals such as those from \nradio and TV stations. In bench evaluation, it is recommended to place all of the components into a shielded box and us e \nfeedthrough decoupling networks for the supply voltage. Ci rcuit \nlayout and construction are also critical because  stray capacitances \nand lead inductances can form resonant circuits and are a potential source of circuit peaking, oscillation, or both.  \n \n \n \nAD603  Data Sheet   \n \nRev.

Schematic of the AD603 Evaluation Board  The output is also ac -coupled and includes a 453  Ω series resistor.  \nSet the AD603 gain by connecting a voltage source between the \nGNEG and GPOS test loops. The two slide switches SGPOS and SGNEG provide three connections fo r GPOS and the GNEG . \nEither pin can be ground  reference d, or biased with a user selected  \nvoltage  established by R1  and R5 to  R7. A signal generator can \nbe connected to the GPOS or GNEG test loops, or the GNEG can \nbe driven to either polarity within the com mon -mode limits of \n−1.2 V to + 2.0 V; to invert the gain slope, simply reverse the \npolarity of the voltage source connected to GPOS and GNEG . \nFor bias current measurements, the third switch option \ndisconnects the bias voltage source an d permits connection o f a \nmicro ammeter between the GPOS and GNEG pins to ground.  \nThe AD603 includes built -in gain resistors selectable at the \nFDBK pin. The board is shipped with the gain at minimum, \nwith a 0  Ω resistor installed in R3. For maximum gain, simply \nremove R3. Becaus e of the architecture of the AD603, the \nbandwidth decrease s by 10, but the gain range remains at 40  dB. \nIntermediate gain values may be selected by installing a resistor \nbetween the VOUT and FDBK pins.  \nFigure 52, Figure 53, and Figure 56 show the c omponent and \ncircuit side copper patterns and silkscreen.  \n00539-051 \nFigure 52.
