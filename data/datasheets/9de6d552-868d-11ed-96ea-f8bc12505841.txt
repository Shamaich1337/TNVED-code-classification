Data is \nwritten to an 8-byte scratchpad, verified, and then copied to the EEPROM memory. As a special feature, the four memory pages can individually be write protected or put in EPROM-emulation mode, where bits can only be changed from a 1 to a 0 state. The DS2431 communi-cates over the single-conductor 1-Wire bus. The com-munication follows the standard 1-Wire protocol. Each device has its own unalterable and unique 64-bit ROM registration number that is factory lasered into the chip. The registration number is used to address the device in a multidrop, 1-Wire net environment.\nApplications\n● Accessory/PCB Identification\n●Medical Sensor Calibration Data Storage\n●Analog Sensor Calibration Including IEEE P1451.4\nSmart Sensors\n● Ink and \nToner Print Cartridge Identification\n●After-Market Management of ConsumablesBenefits and Features\n●Easily Add Traceability and Relevant Information to\nAny Individual System•\n1024 Bits of EEPROM Memory Partitioned IntoFour Pages of 256 Bits\n•\nIndividual Memory Pages Can Be PermanentlyWrite Protected or Put in EPROM-Emulation Mode(Write to 0)\n•\nSwitchpoint Hysteresis and Filtering to OptimizePerformance in the Presence of Noise\n●Minimalist 1-Wire Interface Lowers Cost andInterface Complexity•\nIEC 1000-4-2 Level 4 ESD Protection(±8kV Contact, ±15kV \nAir, typ)\n•Reads and W\nrites Over a Wide Voltage Range\nfrom 2.8V to 5.25V from -40°C to +85°C\n•Communicates to Host with a Single Digital Signalat 15.4kbps or 125kbps\nPin Configurations appear at end of data sheet.\n1-Wire is a registered trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.\n19-4675; Rev 16; 5/21Note: The leads of TO-92 packages on tape and reel are \nformed to approximately 100-mil (2.54mm) spacing.

Each \nDS2431 has its own 64-bit ROM registration number that \nis factory lasered into the chip to provide a guaranteed \nunique identity for absolute traceability. Data is transferred \nserially through the 1-Wire protocol, which requires only a \nsingle data lead and a ground return. The DS2431 has an \nadditional memory area called the scratchpad that acts as \na buffer when writing to the main memory or the register \npage. Data is first written to the scratchpad from which it \ncan be read back. After the data has been verified, a Copy \nScratchpad command transfers the data to its final memory \nlocation. The DS2431 applications include accessory/PCB \nidentification, medical sensor calibration data storage, \nanalog sensor calibration including IEEE P1451.4 smart \nsensors, ink and toner print cartridge identification, and \nafter-market management of consumables.\nOverview\nThe block diagram in Figure 1 shows the relationships \nbetween the major control and memory sections of the \nDS2431. The DS2431 has four main data components: \n64-bit lasered ROM, 64-bit scratchpad, four 32-byte \npages of EEPROM, and a 64-bit register page. Figure 1.

The bus master must first provide one of \nthe seven ROM function commands: Read ROM, Match \nROM, Search ROM, Skip ROM, Resume, Overdrive-Skip \nROM, or Overdrive-Match ROM. Upon completion of an \nOverdrive-Skip ROM or Overdrive-Match ROM command \nbyte executed at standard speed, the device enters over-\ndrive mode where all subsequent communication occurs \nat a higher speed. The protocol required for these ROM \nfunction commands is described in Figure 9. After a ROM \nfunction command is successfully executed, the memory \nfunctions become accessible and the master can provide \nany one of the four memory function commands. The pro-\ntocol for these memory function commands is described \nin Figure 7. All data is read and written least signifi -\ncant bit first.64-Bit Lasered ROM\nEach DS2431 contains a unique ROM code that is 64 bits \nlong. The first 8 bits are a 1-Wire family code. The next 48 \nbits are a unique serial number. The last 8 bits are a cyclic \nredundancy check (CRC) of the first 56 bits. See Figure 3 \nfor details. The 1-Wire CRC is generated using a polyno -\nmial generator consisting of a shift register and XOR gates \nas shown in Figure 4. The polynomial is X 8 + X5 + X4 + 1. \nAdditional information about the 1-Wire CRC is available \nin Application Note 27: Understanding and Using Cyclic \nRedundancy Checks with Maxim iButton® Products.\nThe shift register bits are initialized to 0. Then, starting \nwith the least significant bit of the family code, one bit at \na time is shifted in. After the 8th bit of the family code has \nbeen entered, the serial number is entered. After the last \nbit of the serial number has been entered, the shift reg-\nister contains the CRC value. Shifting in the 8 bits of the \nCRC returns the shift register to all 0s.Figure 2.

The last row is reserved for future use. It is \nundefined in terms of R/W functionality and should not \nbe used.\nIn addition to the main EEPROM array, an 8-byte volatile \nscratchpad is included. Writes to the EEPROM array are \na two-step process. First, data is written to the scratchpad \nand then copied into the main array. This allows the user \nto first verify the data written to the scratchpad prior to \ncopying into the main array. The device only supports full \nrow (8-byte) copy operations. For data in the scratchpad \nto be valid for a copy operation, the address supplied with \na Write Scratchpad command must start on a row bound -\nary, and 8 full bytes must be written into the scratchpad.\nThe protection control registers determine how incom-\ning data on a Write Scratchpad command is loaded into \nthe scratchpad. A protection setting of 55h (write protect) \ncauses the incoming data to be ignored and the target \naddress main memory data to be loaded into the scratch-\npad. A protection setting of AAh (EPROM mode) causes \nthe logical AND of incoming data and target address \nmain memory data to be loaded into the scratchpad. Any \nother protection control register setting leaves the associ-\nated memory page open for unrestricted write access. \nNote: For the EPROM mode to function, the entire \naffected memory page must first be programmed to FFh. \nProtection-control byte settings of 55h or AAh also write \nprotect the protection-control byte. The protection-control \nbyte setting of 55h does not block the copy. This allows \nwrite-protected data to be refreshed (i.e., reprogrammed \nwith the current data) in the device.The copy-protection byte is used for a higher level of \nsecurity and should only be used after all other protection \ncontrol bytes, user bytes, and write-protected pages are \nset to their final value. If the copy-protection byte is set \nto 55h or AAh, all copy attempts to the register row and \nuser-byte row are blocked. In addition, all copy attempts \nto write-protected main memory pages (i.e., refresh) are \nblocked.\nAddress Registers and Transfer Status\nThe DS2431 employs three address registers: TA1, TA2, \nand E/S (Figure 6). These registers are common to many \nother 1-Wire devices but operate slightly differently with \nthe DS2431. Registers TA1 and TA2 must be loaded with \nthe target address to which the data is written or from \nwhich data is read. Register E/S is a read-only transfer-\nstatus register used to verify data integrity with write com-\nmands. E/S bits E[2:0] are loaded with the incoming T[2:0] \non a Write Scratchpad command and increment on each \nsubsequent data byte. This is, in effect, a byte-ending off-\nset counter within the 8-byte scratchpad. Bit 5 of the E/S \nregister, called PF, is a logic 1 if the data in the scratchpad \nis not valid due to a loss of power or if the master sends \nfewer bytes than needed to reach the end of the scratch-\npad. For a valid write to the scratchpad, T[2:0] must be 0 \nand the master must have sent 8 data bytes. Bits 3, 4, and \n6 have no function; they always read 0. The highest val-\nued bit of the E/S register, called authorization accepted \n(AA), acts as a flag to indicate that the data stored in the \nscratchpad has already been copied to the target memory \naddress. Writing data to the scratchpad clears this flag.\nFigure 6.

First, the master issues \nthe Write Scratchpad command to specify the desired \ntarget address, followed by the data to be written to the \nscratchpad. Note that Copy Scratchpad commands must \nbe performed on 8-byte boundaries, i.e., the three LSBs \nof the target address (T2, T1, T0) must be equal to 000b. \nIf T[2:0] are sent with nonzero values, the copy func -\ntion is blocked. Under certain conditions (see the Write \nScratchpad [0Fh] section) the master receives an inverted \nCRC-16 of the command, address (actual address sent), \nand data at the end of the Write Scratchpad command \nsequence. Knowing this CRC value, the master can \ncompare it to the value it has calculated to decide if the \ncommunication was successful and proceed to the Copy \nScratchpad command. If the master could not receive the \nCRC-16, it should send the Read Scratchpad command to \nverify data integrity. As a preamble to the scratchpad data, \nthe DS2431 repeats the target address TA1 and TA2 and \nsends the contents of the E/S register. If the PF flag is set, \ndata did not arrive correctly in the scratchpad, or there was \na loss of power since data was last written to the scratch -\npad. The master does not need to continue reading; it can \nstart a new trial to write data to the scratchpad. Similarly, \na set AA flag together with a cleared PF flag indicates that \nthe device did not recognize the Write command.\nIf everything went correctly, both flags are cleared. Now \nthe master can continue reading and verifying every data \nbyte. After the master has verified the data, it can send the \nCopy Scratchpad command, for example. This command \nmust be followed exactly by the data of the three address \nregisters, TA1, TA2, and E/S. The master should obtain \nthe contents of these registers by reading the scratchpad.\nMemory Function Commands\nThe Memory Function Flowchart (Figure 7) describes \nthe protocols necessary for accessing the memory of the \nDS2431. An example on how to use these functions to \nwrite to and read from the device is in the Memory Function \nExample section. The communication between the master \nand the DS2431 takes place either at standard speed (default, OD = 0) or at overdrive speed (OD = 1). If not \nexplicitly set into overdrive mode, the DS2431 assumes \nstandard speed.\nWrite Scratchpad [0Fh]\nThe Write Scratchpad command applies to the data \nmemory and the writable addresses in the register page. \nFor the scratchpad data to be valid for copying to the \narray, the user must perform a Write Scratchpad com-\nmand of 8 bytes starting at a valid row boundary. The \nWrite Scratchpad command accepts invalid addresses \nand partial rows, but subsequent Copy Scratchpad com-\nmands are blocked.\nAfter issuing the Write Scratchpad command, the master \nmust first provide the 2-byte target address, followed by \nthe data to be written to the scratchpad. The data is writ-\nten to the scratchpad starting at the byte offset of T[2:0]. \nThe E/S bits E[2:0] are loaded with the starting byte offset \nand increment with each subsequent byte. Effectively, \nE[2:0] is the byte offset of the last full byte written to the \nscratchpad. Only full data bytes are accepted.\nWhen executing the Write Scratchpad command, the \nCRC generator inside the DS2431 (Figure 13) calculates \na CRC of the entire data stream, starting at the command \ncode and ending at the last data byte as sent by the mas-\nter. This CRC is generated using the CRC-16 polynomial \nby first clearing the CRC generator and then shifting in the \ncommand code (0Fh) of the Write Scratchpad command, \nthe target addresses (TA1 and TA2), and all the data \nbytes. Note that the CRC-16 calculation is performed with \nthe actual TA1 and TA2 and data sent by the master. The \nmaster can end the Write Scratchpad command at any \ntime. However, if the end of the scratchpad is reached \n(E[2:0] = 111b), the master can send 16 read time slots \nand receive the CRC generated by the DS2431.\nIf a Write Scratchpad command is attempted to a write-\nprotected location, the scratchpad is loaded with the data \nalready existing in memory rather than the data transmitted. \nSimilarly, if the target address page is in EPROM mode, \nthe scratchpad is loaded with the bitwise logical AND of the \ntransmitted data and data already existing in memory.\nDS2431 1024-Bit, 1-Wire EEPROM\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 9\nFigure 7a.

After \nissuing the command code, the master begins reading. \nThe first two bytes are the target address. The next byte \nis the ending offset/data status byte (E/S) followed by the \nscratchpad data, which may be different from what the \nmaster originally sent. This is of particular importance if \nthe target address is within the register page or a page \nin either write-protection mode or EPROM mode. See the \nWrite Scratchpad [0Fh] section for details. The master \nshould read through the scratchpad (E[2:0] - T[2:0] + 1 \nbytes), after which it receives the inverted CRC based on \ndata as it was sent by the DS2431. If the master continues \nreading after the CRC, all data is logic 1.\nCopy Scratchpad [55h]\nThe Copy Scratchpad command is used to copy data \nfrom the scratchpad to writable memory sections. After \nissuing the Copy Scratchpad command, the master must \nprovide a 3-byte authorization pattern, which should \nhave been obtained by an immediately preceding Read \nScratchpad command. This 3-byte pattern must exactly \nmatch the data contained in the three address registers \n(TA1, TA2, E/S, in that order). If the pattern matches, the \ntarget address is valid, the PF flag is not set, and the tar -\nget memory is not copy protected, then the AA flag is set \nand the copy begins. All 8 bytes of scratchpad contents \nare copied to the target memory location. The duration \nof the device’s internal data transfer is t PROG  during \nwhich the voltage on the 1-Wire bus must not fall below \n2.8V. A pattern of alternating 0s and 1s are transmitted \nafter the data has been copied until the master issues a \nreset pulse. If the PF flag is set or the target memory is \ncopy protected, the copy does not begin and the AA flag \nis not set.\nRead Memory [F0h]\nThe Read Memory command is the general function to \nread data from the DS2431. After issuing the command, \nthe master must provide the 2-byte target address. After \nthese 2 bytes, the master reads data beginning from the \ntarget address and can continue until address 008Fh. If \nthe master continues reading, the result is logic 1s. The \ndevice’s internal TA1, TA2, E/S, and scratchpad contents \nare not affected by a Read Memory command.1-Wire Bus System\nThe 1-Wire bus is a system that has a single bus master \nand one or more slaves. In all instances the DS2431 is \na slave device. The bus master is typically a microcon -\ntroller. The discussion of this bus system is broken down \ninto three topics: hardware configuration, transaction \nsequence, and 1-Wire signaling (signal types and timing). \nThe 1-Wire protocol defines bus transactions in terms of \nthe bus state during specific time slots, which are initiated \non the falling edge of sync pulses from the bus master.\nHardware Configuration\nThe 1-Wire bus has only a single line by definition; it is \nimportant that each device on the bus be able to drive \nit at the appropriate time. To facilitate this, each device \nattached to the 1-Wire bus must have open-drain or three-\nstate outputs. The 1-Wire port of the DS2431 is open drain \nwith an internal circuit equivalent to that shown in Figure 8.\nA multidrop bus consists of a 1-Wire bus with multiple \nslaves attached. The DS2431 supports both a standard \nand overdrive communication speed of 15.4kbps (max) \nand 125kbps (max), respectively. Note that legacy 1-Wire \nproducts support a standard communication speed of \n16.3kbps and overdrive of 142kbps. The slightly reduced \nrates for the DS2431 are a result of additional recovery \ntimes, which in turn were driven by a 1-Wire physical \ninterface enhancement to improve noise immunity. The \nvalue of the pullup resistor primarily depends on the net-\nwork size and load conditions. The DS2431 requires a \npullup resistor of 2.2kΩ (max) at any speed.\nThe idle state for the 1-Wire bus is high. If for any reason \na transaction needs to be suspended, the bus must be \nleft in the idle state if the transaction is to resume. If this \ndoes not occur and the bus is left low for more than 16μs \n(overdrive speed) or more than 120μs (standard speed), \none or more devices on the bus could be reset.\nTransaction Sequence\nThe protocol for accessing the DS2431 through the \n1-Wire port is as follows:\n● Initialization\n● ROM Function Command\n● Memory Function Command\n● Transaction/Data\nDS2431 1024-Bit, 1-Wire EEPROM\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 12\nInitialization\nAll transactions on the 1-Wire bus begin with an initializa -\ntion sequence. The initialization sequence consists of a \nreset pulse transmitted by the bus master followed by \npresence pulse(s) transmitted by the slave(s). The pres-\nence pulse lets the bus master know that the DS2431 is \non the bus and is ready to operate. For more details, see \nthe 1-Wire Signaling section.\n1-Wire ROM Function Commands\nOnce the bus master has detected a presence, it can \nissue one of the seven ROM function commands that the \nDS2431 supports. All ROM function commands are 8 bits \nlong. A list of these commands follows (see the flowchart \nin Figure 9).\nRead ROM [33h]\nThe Read ROM command allows the bus master to read \nthe DS2431’s 8-bit family code, unique 48-bit serial num-\nber, and 8-bit CRC. This command can only be used if \nthere is a single slave on the bus. If more than one slave \nis present on the bus, a data collision occurs when all \nslaves try to transmit at the same time (open drain pro-\nduces a wired-AND result). The resultant family code and \n48-bit serial number result in a mismatch of the CRC.\nMatch ROM [55h]\nThe Match ROM command, followed by a 64-bit ROM \nsequence, allows the bus master to address a specific \nDS2431 on a multidrop bus. Only the DS2431 that exactly \nmatches the 64-bit ROM sequence responds to the sub-\nsequent memory function command. All other slaves wait \nfor a reset pulse. This command can be used with a single \ndevice or multiple devices on the bus.Search ROM [F0h]\nWhen a system is initially brought up, the bus master \nmight not know the number of devices on the 1-Wire \nbus or their registration numbers. By taking advantage \nof the wired-AND property of the bus, the master can \nuse a process of elimination to identify the registration \nnumbers of all slave devices. For each bit of the registra-\ntion number, starting with the least significant bit, the bus \nmaster issues a triplet of time slots. On the first slot, each \nslave device participating in the search outputs the true \nvalue of its registration number bit. On the second slot, \neach slave device participating in the search outputs the \ncomplemented value of its registration number bit. On \nthe third slot, the master writes the true value of the bit \nto be selected. All slave devices that do not match the \nbit written by the master stop participating in the search. \nIf both of the read bits are zero, the master knows that \nslave devices exist with both states of the bit. By choosing \nwhich state to write, the bus master branches in the ROM \ncode tree. After one complete pass, the bus master knows \nthe registration number of a single device. Additional \npasses identify the registration numbers of the remaining \ndevices. Refer to Application Note 187: 1-Wire Search \nAlgorithm  for a detailed discussion, including an example.\nSkip ROM [CCh]\nThis command can save time in a single-drop bus sys-\ntem by allowing the bus master to access the memory \nfunctions without providing the 64-bit ROM code. If more \nthan one slave is present on the bus and, for example, \na read command is issued following the Skip ROM com-\nmand, data collision occurs on the bus as multiple slaves \ntransmit simultaneously (open-drain pulldowns produce a \nwired-AND result).Figure 8.

This command \nchecks the status of the RC bit and, if it is set, directly \ntransfers control to the memory function commands, similar \nto a Skip ROM command. The only way to set the RC bit \nis through successfully executing the Match ROM, Search \nROM, or Overdrive-Match ROM command. Once the RC \nbit is set, the device can repeatedly be accessed through \nthe Resume command. Accessing another device on the \nbus clears the RC bit, preventing two or more devices from \nsimultaneously responding to the Resume command.\nOverdrive-Skip ROM [3Ch]\nOn a single-drop bus this command can save time by \nallowing the bus master to access the memory functions \nwithout providing the 64-bit ROM code. Unlike the normal \nSkip ROM command, the Overdrive-Skip ROM command \nsets the DS2431 into the overdrive mode (OD = 1). All \ncommunication following this command must occur at \noverdrive speed until a reset pulse of minimum 480μs \nduration resets all devices on the bus to standard speed \n(OD = 0).\nWhen issued on a multidrop bus, this command sets all \noverdrive-supporting devices into overdrive mode. To \nsubsequently address a specific overdrive-supporting \ndevice, a reset pulse at overdrive speed must be issued \nfollowed by a Match ROM or Search ROM command \nsequence. This speeds up the time for the search pro-\ncess. If more than one slave supporting overdrive is pres-\nent on the bus and the Overdrive-Skip ROM command \nis followed by a read command, data collision occurs on \nthe bus as multiple slaves transmit simultaneously (open-\ndrain pulldowns produce a wired-AND result).\nOverdrive-Match ROM [69h]\nThe Overdrive-Match ROM command followed by a 64-bit \nROM sequence transmitted at overdrive speed allows \nthe bus master to address a specific DS2431 on a multi-\ndrop bus and to simultaneously set it in overdrive mode. \nOnly the DS2431 that exactly matches the 64-bit ROM \nsequence responds to the subsequent memory function \ncommand. Slaves already in overdrive mode from a previ-\nous Overdrive-Skip ROM or successful Overdrive-Match \nROM command remain in overdrive mode. All overdrive-\ncapable slaves return to standard speed at the next reset \npulse of minimum 480μs duration. The Overdrive-Match \nROM command can be used with a single device or mul-\ntiple devices on the bus.1-Wire Signaling\nThe DS2431 requires strict protocols to ensure data integ-\nrity. The protocol consists of four types of signaling on \none line: reset sequence with reset pulse and presence \npulse, write-zero, write-one, and read-data. Except for the \npresence pulse, the bus master initiates all falling edges. \nThe DS2431 can communicate at two different speeds: \nstandard speed and overdrive speed. If not explicitly set \ninto the overdrive mode, the DS2431 communicates at \nstandard speed. While in overdrive mode, the fast timing \napplies to all waveforms.\nTo get from idle to active, the voltage on the 1-Wire line \nneeds to fall from V PUP below the threshold V TL. To get \nfrom active to idle, the voltage needs to rise from V ILMAX \npast the threshold V TH. The time it takes for the voltage \nto make this rise is seen in Figure 10 as ε, and its dura-\ntion depends on the pullup resistor (R PUP) used and the \ncapacitance of the 1-Wire network attached. The voltage \nVILMAX  is relevant for the DS2431 when determining a \nlogical level, not triggering any events.\nFigure 10 shows the initialization sequence required to \nbegin any communication with the DS2431. A reset pulse \nfollowed by a presence pulse indicates that the DS2431 \nis ready to receive data, given the correct ROM and mem-\nory function command. If the bus master uses slew-rate \ncontrol on the falling edge, it must pull down the line for \ntRSTL  + tF to compensate for the edge. A t RSTL  duration \nof 480μs or longer exits the overdrive mode, returning the \ndevice to standard speed. If the DS2431 is in overdrive \nmode and t RSTL  is no longer than 80μs, the device \nremains in overdrive mode. If the device is in overdrive \nmode and t RSTL  is between 80μs and 480μs, the device \nresets, but the communication speed is undetermined.\nAfter the bus master has released the line it goes into \nreceive mode. Now the 1-Wire bus is pulled to V PUP \nthrough the pullup resistor or, in the case of a DS2482-x00 \nor DS2480B driver, through the active circuitry. When the \nthreshold V TH is crossed, the DS2431 waits for t PDH and \nthen transmits a presence pulse by pulling the line low for \ntPDL. To detect a presence pulse, the master must test the \nlogical state of the 1-Wire line at t MSP.\nThe t RSTH  window must be at least the sum of  \ntPDHMAX , tPDLMAX , and t RECMIN . Immediately after \ntRSTH  is expired, the DS2431 is ready for data commu-\nnication. In a mixed population network, t RSTH  should be \nextended to minimum 480μs at standard speed and 48μs \nat overdrive speed to accommodate other 1-Wire devices.\nDS2431 1024-Bit, 1-Wire EEPROM\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 16\nRead/Write Time Slots\nData communication with the DS2431 takes place in time \nslots that carry a single bit each. Write time slots transport \ndata from bus master to slave. Read time slots transfer \ndata from slave to master. Figure 11 illustrates the defini -\ntions of the write and read time slots.\nAll communication begins with the master pulling the data \nline low. As the voltage on the 1-Wire line falls below \nthe threshold V TL, the DS2431 starts its internal timing \ngenerator that determines when the data line is sampled \nduring a write time slot and how long data is valid during \na read time slot.\nMaster-to-Slave\nFor a write-one time slot, the voltage on the data line \nmust have crossed the V TH threshold before the write-\none low time t W1LMAX  is expired. For a write-zero time \nslot, the voltage on the data line must stay below the V TH \nthreshold until the write-zero low time t W0LMIN  is expired. \nFor the most reliable communication, the voltage on the \ndata line should not exceed V ILMAX  during the entire \ntW0L or t W1L window. After the V TH threshold has been \ncrossed, the DS2431 needs a recovery time t REC before \nit is ready for the next time slot.Slave-to-Master\nA read-data time slot begins like a write-one time slot. \nThe voltage on the data line must remain below V TL until \nthe read low time t RL is expired. During the t RL window, \nwhen responding with a 0, the DS2431 starts pulling the \ndata line low; its internal timing generator determines \nwhen this pulldown ends and the voltage starts rising \nagain. When responding with a 1, the DS2431 does not \nhold the data line low at all, and the voltage starts rising \nas soon as t RL is over.\nThe sum of t RL + δ (rise time) on one side and the internal \ntiming generator of the DS2431 on the other side define \nthe master sampling window (t MSRMIN  to t MSRMAX ), in \nwhich the master must perform a read from the data line. \nFor the most reliable communication, t RL should be as \nshort as permissible, and the master should read close \nto but no later than t MSRMAX . After reading from the data \nline, the master must wait until t SLOT  is expired. This \nguarantees sufficient recovery time t REC for the DS2431 \nto get ready for the next time slot. Note that t REC speci -\nfied herein applies only to a single DS2431 attached to a \n1-Wire line. For multidevice configurations, t REC must be \nextended to accommodate the additional 1-Wire device \ninput capacitance. Alternatively, an interface that performs \nactive pullup during the 1-Wire recovery time such as the \nDS2482-x00 or DS2480B 1-Wire line drivers can be used.Figure 10.

Depending on the physical size \nand topology of the network, reflections from end points \nand branch points can add up or cancel each other to \nsome extent. Such reflections are visible as glitches or \nringing on the 1-Wire communication line. Noise coupled \nonto the 1-Wire line from external sources can also result \nin signal glitching. A glitch during the rising edge of a time \nslot can cause a slave device to lose synchronization with \nthe master and, consequently, result in a Search ROM \ncommand coming to a dead end or cause a device-spe -\ncific function command to abort. For better performance \nin network applications, the DS2431 uses a new 1-Wire \nfront-end, which makes it less sensitive to noise.\nThe DS2431’s 1-Wire front-end differs from traditional \nslave devices in three characteristics.\n1) There is additional lowpass filtering in the circuit that \ndetects the falling edge at the beginning of a time slot. \nThis reduces the sensitivity to high-frequency noise. \nThis additional filtering does not apply at overdrive \nspeed.\n2) There is a hysteresis at the low-to-high switching \nthreshold V TH. If a negative glitch crosses V TH but \ndoes not go below V TH - V HY, it is not recognized \n(Figure 12, Case A). The hysteresis is effective at any \n1-Wire speed.\n3) There is a time window specified by the rising edge \nhold-off time tREH during which glitches are ignored, \neven if they extend below the V TH - V HY threshold (Figure 12, Case B, t GL < tREH). Deep voltage drops \nor glitches that appear late after crossing the V TH \nthreshold and extend beyond the t REH window cannot \nbe filtered out and are taken as the beginning of a new \ntime slot (Figure 12, Case C, t GL ≥ tREH).\nDevices that have the parameters V HY and t REH speci-\nfied in their electrical characteristics use the improved \n1-Wire front-end.\nCRC Generation\nThe DS2431 uses two different types of CRCs. One CRC \nis an 8-bit type and is stored in the most significant byte \nof the 64-bit ROM. The bus master can compute a CRC \nvalue from the first 56 bits of the 64-bit ROM and compare \nit to the value stored within the DS2431 to determine if the \nROM data has been received error-free. The equivalent \npolynomial function of this CRC is X 8 + X5 + X4 + 1. This \n8-bit CRC is received in the true (noninverted) form. It is \ncomputed at the factory and lasered into the ROM.\nThe other CRC is a 16-bit type, generated according to \nthe standardized CRC-16 polynomial function X 16 + X 15 \n+ X2 + 1. This CRC is used for fast verification of a data \ntransfer when writing to or reading from the scratchpad. In \ncontrast to the 8-bit CRC, the 16-bit CRC is always com-\nmunicated in the inverted form. A CRC generator inside \nthe DS2431 chip (Figure 13) calculates a new 16-bit CRC, \nas shown in the command flowchart (Figure 7). The bus \nmaster compares the CRC value read from the device to \nthe one it calculates from the data and decides whether to \ncontinue with an operation or to reread the portion of the \ndata with the CRC error.\nWith the Write Scratchpad command, the CRC is gener -\nated by first clearing the CRC generator and then shifting \nin the command code, the target addresses TA1 and TA2, \nFigure 12.
