The mainly failure modes are as follows.\n1.2-1 Contingency failure\nThe most common failure mode is a short circuit. Mainly caused by the soldering or operating temperature\nenvironment, along with heat stresses, electrical stresses or mechanical stressesas follows.\n・ Applying voltage over the rated voltage.\n・ Applying reverse voltage\n・ Excessive mechanical stress\n・ Applying rush current by sudden charge or discharge out of the specification.\n(1) The following phenomenon is seen when short-current is applied to the OS-CON.\n(a) When current is relatively low. (ø10 : approx 1 A or less, ø8 : approx 0.5 A or less, ø6.3 : approx 0.2 A or less) \nThe OS-CON becomes heated, but no effects are visible even when the current is continously carried.\n(b) When the short circuit currents exceed the mentioned value above.\n After internal temperature increase, sealing rubber may be turned over. In some cases, odorous gas may be produced.\n(2) In case a short circuit occurs, ensure safety by fully considering the followings.\n(a) If odorous gas is released, turn off the main power of the equipment.\n In this case, keep your face and hands away from the area.\n(b) Though it depends on the conditions, it takes seconds to minutes before odorant gas generates.\n Protective circuit should operate in this period.\n(c) If the gas comes into eyes, rinse immediately. If the gas is inhaled, gargle immediately.\n(d) Do not lick the electrolyte. If the electrolyte touches skin, wash it off with soap immediately.\n(e) The OS-CON contains combustible substances. In case a large current continues to flow after a short circuit, \n in the worst case, the shorted-out section may ignite. For safety, install a redundant circuit or a protective \ncircuit, etc.\n1.2-2 Wear-out failure (life time)\nWhen lifetime span exceeded the specified guarantee time of endurance and damp heat, electrolyte might insulate \nand cause electric characteristic changed. This is called an open circuit.\nThe electric characteristics of capacitance and ESR may possibly change within the specified range in specifications \neven if it is used under the condition of the rated voltage, electric and mechanical performance. \nPlease note it when designing.\n1.3 Leakage current\nMechanical stress may cause OS-CON’s leakage current increased.In such a case, leakage current will gradually decrease by applying voltage (withinthe category voltage and the upper limit of category temperature).\n1.4 Rapid charge and discharge limitation\nAllowance of a large rush current to flow due to rapid charge and discharge may result in short circuit or large leakage current. The protection circuit, to maintain high reliability, is recommended when rush current to flow to the OS-CON is in the following cases.\n(1) Products which 10 times of allowable ripple current is less than 10 A : It is when 10 A or over of rush current is \napplied.\n(2) Products which 10 times of allowable ripple current is 10 A or over : It is when rush current, which the figure is over \n10 times of allowable ripple current, is applied.\n05-Mar-21\u3000\u3000Application Guidelines（OS-CON ）\n 1.
