Ceramic Patch Antennas must avoid shock and drop , to prevent cracking of the antenna. \n3. Ceramic Patch Antennas should be used within 6 m onths after delivery, antennas older than 6 months \nshould be checked for solderability before using. \n \n SPECIFICATION PAGE  \nN25-4102920-GNS1 7/8 \n \nCERAMIC PATCH ANTENNA                                             AMOTECH CO.,LTD. \n6.
