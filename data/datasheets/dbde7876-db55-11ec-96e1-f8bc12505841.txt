Description  \nThe IVCO1A01 is a 10A single -channel isolated gate \ndriver with 3.75kVrms isolation. It is capable of \neffectively and safely driving MOSFETs and IGBTs.  \nLow propagation delay and compact SOIC -8 package \nenables MOSFETs to switch at hundreds of kHz. It is \nvery su itable for server and telecom power supply’s \nsynchronous rectification driving, where synchronous \nMOSFET’s dead time accuracy directly impacts \nconverter’s efficiency.   \nWide output VDD operating range from 9.5V to 33V \nenables effective driving with Si or SiC MOSFET and \nIGBT power switches. Integrated UVLO protection \nensures output held at low under abnormal conditions. \nThe input VDD operates from 2.5V to 5.5V, which \nsupports most digital controllers .  \nWith integ rated isolation barrier, IVCO1A01 can \nsupport isolation up to 3.75kVrms. It is very \nconvenient to control MOSFET/IGBT gate drive \nacross isolation barrier or with level shifting . \n \nDevice Information  \nPART \nNUMBER  PACKAGE  PACKING  \nIVCO1A01DR  SOIC-8 Tape and Reel \nIVCO1 A01D SOIC-8 Tube  \n \n \n \n        \nIN+\nIN-2\n3\nGND 14OUT H 6VCC2 5VCC2\nOUT L 7Gate \nDrive \nVEE2 8ISOLATINO BARRIER\nUVLO\nand\nInput \nLogicVCC11  \n                                                                              \nIVCO 1A01\nVCC 1\nIN+\nIN-\nGND 1321\n468\n7\n5VEE2\nOUT L\nOUTH\nVCC 2\nDec 2021 \n2 \n \nTable of Contents  \n1 Features     ………………………………………………………………………….………………….  1  \n2 Applications   ……………………………….….……………………………………………….……...  1  \n3 Description ………………………….…………………….…………………………………….……...  1  \n4 Pin Configuration and Functions     …...….………………………………………………….……...  2  \n5 Specifications    ……………………………………….……………………………………………….….……...   3 \n6 Typical Characteristics    …………………………….………………………………………………….……...   5  \n7 Detailed Description          …………………………...………………….…………………….……...  10 \n8 Application and Implementation      ………………….…….………………………………….……...  12 \n9 Layout         ………………………...………………….…….………………………………….……...  13 \n10 Packaging Information    ………………….………………….………………….…………….……...  14 \n \n4.

Detail Descriptions  \nIVCO1A01 driver is single -channel isolated gate driver with 3750Vrms insulation voltage. It features split outputs \nwhich make pull -up and pull -down capabilities independently adjustable.  \n \n7.1  Input Signals  \n \nIN+ and IN - are non -inverting and inverting logic gate driver inputs. The pins have a weak pulldown or pullup. \nWhen left floating, outputs are pulled to VEE2.

Each output stage in IVCO1A01 can supply 10A peak source and 10A peak sink curr ent pulses. \nThe output voltage swings between VCC2 and VEE2 providing rail -to-rail operation. The presence of the \nMOSFET body diodes also offers voltage clamping paths to limit overshoot and undershoot. That means that \nin many cases, external Schottky diod e clamps may not be necessary.  \n \n \n7.3  VCC and Under Voltage Protection  \nIVCO1A01 maximum VCC1 voltage rating is 7V. The VCC1 internal under voltage lockout (UVLO) protection \nthreshold voltage is 2.25V typical, which enables the input stage working with 2.5V, 3.3V or 5V supply voltages. \nWhen VCC1 level is below UVLO  (VCC1) threshold, this device holds the output LOW, regardless of the status \nof the inputs.  \nIVCO1A01 maximum VCC2 voltage rating is 36V. It is suitable for Si MOSFET, IGBT and SiC MOSFET gate \ndrive. The output stage has VCC2 internal under voltage lockout (UVLO) protection feature.
