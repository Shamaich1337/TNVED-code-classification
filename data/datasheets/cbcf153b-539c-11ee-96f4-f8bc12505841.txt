Supply biased \n 2. Human Body Model (MIL-STD 883 Method 3015)  3. Machine Model (JEDEC JESD22-A115) Switching Frequency \nThe PE42850 has a maximum 10 kHz switching \nrate when the internal negative voltage generator is used (pin 16 = GND). The rate at which the PE42850 can be switched is only limited to the switching time (Table 1 ) if an external negative \nsupply is provided (pin 16 = V\nSS_EXT ). \n Switching frequency describes the time duration between switching events. Switching time is the time duration between the point the control signal reaches 50% of the final value and the point the output signal reaches within 10% or 90% of its target value. \nSpurious Performance \nThe typical spurious performance of the PE42850 \nis –130 dBm when V\nSS_EXT = 0V (pin 16 = GND). If \nfurther improvement is desired, the internal negative voltage generator can be disabled by setting V\nSS_EXT = –3.4V. Optional External V SS Control (V SS_EXT ) \nFor proper operation, the V SS_EXT control pin must \nbe grounded or tied to the Vss voltage specified in Table 3. When the V\nSS_EXT control pin is grounded, \nFETs in the switch are biased with an internal voltage generator. For applications that require the lowest possible spur performance, V\nSS_EXT can be \napplied externally to bypass the internal negative voltage generator.  \nNote: *  In a 2TX–1RX SP3T configuration, TX1 and TX2 are tied and TX3 and \nTX4 are tied respectively.

VSWR conditions that present short circuit loads to the part can cause significantly more power dissipation than with proper matching.  Special consideration needs to be made in the design of the PCB to properly dissipate the heat away from the part and maintain the +85 °C maximum case temperature. It is recommended to use best design practices for high power QFN packages: multi-layer PCBs with thermal vias in a thermal pad soldered to the slug of the package. Special care also needs to be made to alleviate solder voiding under the part. Table 6.

The evaluation board in Figure 23 was designed to test the part in the 5T configuration. DC power is supplied through J10, with V\nDD on pin 9, and \nGND on the entire lower row of even numbered pins. To evaluate a switch path, add or remove jumpers on V1 (pin 3), V2 (pin 5), and V3 (pin 7) using Table 5 (adding a jumper pulls the \nCMOS control pin low and removing it allows the on-board pull-up resistor to set the CMOS control pin high). Pins 11 and 13 of J10 are N/C.  The ANT port is connected through a 50Ω \ntransmission line via the top SMA connector, J1. \nRX and TX paths are also connected through 50 Ω \ntransmission lines via SMA connectors. A 50Ω through transmission line is available via \nSMA connectors J8 and J9. This transmission line can be used to estimate the loss of the PCB over the environmental conditions being evaluated.  An open-ended 50 Ω transmission line is also provided \nat J7 for calibration if needed.  Narrow trace widths are used near each part to improve impedance matching.  Figure 23.
