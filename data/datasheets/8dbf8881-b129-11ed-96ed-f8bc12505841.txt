In high-performance memory systems, thesedecoders can be used to minimize the effects of system decoding. When employed with high-speed memoriesutilizing a fast enable circuit, the delay times of these decoders and the enable time of the memory usually areless than the typical access time of the memory. This means that the effective system delay introduced by thedecoders is negligible.\nThe conditions at the binary-select inputs and the three enable inputs select one of eight output lines. Two\nactive-low and one active-high enable inputs reduce the need for external gates or inverters when expanding.A 24-line decoder can be implemented without external inverters, and a 32-line decoder requires only oneinverter. An enable input can be used as a data input for demultiplexing applications (see ApplicationInformation).\nORDERING INFORMATION\nTA PACKAGE †ORDERABLE\nPART NUMBERTOP-SIDE\nMARKING\nPDIP – E Tube CD74AC138E CD74AC138E\n55°Cto125 °CSOIC MTube CD74AC138M\nAC138M –55°C to 125°CSOIC – M\nTape and reel CD74AC138M96AC138M\nCDIP – F Tube CD54AC138F3A CD54AC138F3A\n†Package drawings, standard packing quantities, thermal data, symbolization, and PCB design guidelines\nare available at www.ti.com/sc/package.\nOn products compliant to MIL-PRF-38535, all parameters are tested\nunless otherwise noted.

  - Absolute Maximum Supply Voltage: -0.5V to 6V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Continuous Output Current (I_O): ±50 mA
  - High-Level Output Current (I_OH): -24 mA (at V_CC = 4.5V to 5.5V)
  - Low-Level Output Current (I_OL): 24 mA (at V_CC = 4.5V to 5.5V)

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Typical Power Dissipation Capacitance (C_pd): 110 pF
  - Supply Current (I_CC): 8 µA to 160 µA (at V_CC = 5.5V)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -55°C to 125°C

- **Package Type:**
  - SOIC (Small Outline Integrated Circuit) with 16 pins (CD74AC138M)

- **Special Features:**
  - Balanced noise immunity at 30% of the supply voltage.
  - SCR-latchup-resistant CMOS process.
  - Exceeds 2-kV ESD protection per MIL-STD-883, Method 3015.
  - Balanced propagation delays.

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - Level 1 (according to JEDEC J-STD-020E)

### Typical Applications:
The CD74AC138M is commonly used in:
- **Memory Decoding:** It minimizes the effects of system decoding in high-performance memory systems.
- **Data Routing:** It can be employed in data transmission systems where quick and efficient routing of signals is required.
