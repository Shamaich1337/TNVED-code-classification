They offer –3 dB signal bandwidth greater than750 MHz along with slew rate of 750 V/ ms. With better than\n80 dB of crosstalk and isolation, they are useful in many highspeed applications.  The differential gain and differential phaseerror of  0.02% and 0.02 °, along with 0.1 dB flatness beyond\n100 MHz make the AD8180 and AD8182 ideal for professionalvideo multiplexing. They offer 10 ns switching time makingthem an excellent choice for pixel switching (picture-in-picture)while consuming less than 3.8 mA (per 2:1 mux) on –5 V sup-\nply voltages.\nBoth devices offer a high speed disable feature allowing the\noutput to be configured into a high impedance state. This al-lows multiple outputs to be connected together  for cascadingstages while the “OFF” channels do not load the output bus.They operate on voltage supplies of –5 V and are offered in  8-\nand 14-lead plastic DIP and SOIC packages.\n500mV\n/DIV\n5ns/DIV\nFigure 1.

IN0 = +1 V dc, IN1 = –1 V dc. SELECT input is driven with 0 V to +5 V pulse. Measure transition time from 50%  of the SELECT input value\n(+2.5 V) and 10% (or 90%) of the total output voltage transition from IN0 channel voltage (+1 V) to IN1 (–1 V), or vice versa.\n2ENABLE  pin is driven with 0 V to +5 V pulse (with 3 ns edges). State of SELECT input determines which channel is activated (i.e., if SELECT = Logic 0, IN0 is selected). Set\nIN0 = +1 V dc, IN1 = –1 V dc, and measure transition time from 50% of ENABLE  pulse (+2.5 V) to 90% of the total output voltage change. In Figure 5, DtOFF is the disable\ntime,  DtON is the enable time.\n3All inputs are grounded. SELECT input is driven with 0 V to +5 V pulse. The outputs are monitored. Speeding the edges of the SE LECT pulse increases the glitch magnitude\ndue to coupling via the ground plane. Removing the SELECT input termination will lower glitch, as does increasing R L.\n4Decreasing R L lowers the bandwidth slightly. Increasing C L lowers the bandwidth considerably (see Figure 19).\n5A resistor (R S) placed in series with the mux inputs serves to optimize 0.1 dB flatness, but is not required. Increasing output capacitance w ill increase peaking and reduce band-\nwidth (see Figure 20.)\n6Select input which is not being driven (i.e., if SELECT is Logic 1, input activated is IN1); drive all other inputs with V IN = 0.707 V rms and monitor output at ƒ = 5 and 30 MHz.\nRL = 1 kW (see Figure 13).\n7Mux is disabled (i.e., ENABLE  = Logic 1) and all inputs are driven simultaneously with V IN = 0.446 V rms. Output is monitored at ƒ = 5 and 30 MHz. R L = 30 W to simulate\nRON of one enabled mux within a system (see Figure 14). In this mode the output impedance is very high (typ 10 M W), and the signal couples across the package; the load imped-\nance determines the crosstalk.\n8Voltage gain decreases for lower values of R L. The resistive divider formed by the mux enabled output resistance (27 W) and R L causes a gain which  decreases as R L decreases\n(i.e., the voltage gain is approximately 0.97 V/V (3% gain error) for R L = 1 kW).\n9Larger values of R L provide wider output voltage swings, as well as better gain accuracy. See Note 8.\nSpecifications subject to change without notice.AD8180/AD8182\nCAUTION\nESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device.

The maximum safe junction temperature forplastic encapsulated devices is determined by the glass transitiontemperature of the plastic, approximately +150 °C.  Exceeding\nthis limit temporarily may cause a shift in parametric perfor-mance due to a change in the stresses exerted on the die by thepackage.  Exceeding a junction temperature of +175 °C for an\nextended period can result in device failure.While the AD8180 and AD8182 are internally short circuit\nprotected, this may not be sufficient to guarantee that the maxi-mum junction temperature (+150 °C) is not exceeded under all\nconditions.  To ensure proper operation, it is necessary to observethe maximum power derating curves shown in Figures 2 and 3.\nMAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION – Watts\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE – 8C2.0\n1.5\n0–50 90–40 –30 –20 –10 0 10 20 30 50 60 70 80 401.0\n0.5 8-LEAD PLASTIC DIP PACKAGE\n 8-LEAD SOIC PACKAGE TJ = +150 8C\nFigure 2.

For heavier loads, the dc gain is approximately\nthat of the voltage divider formed by the output impedance ofthe mux (typically  27 W) and R\nL.\nHigh speed disable clamp circuits at the bases of Q5–Q8 (not\nshown) allow the buffers to turn off quickly and cleanly withoutdissipating much power once off. Moreover, these clamps shuntdisplacement currents flowing through the junction capacitancesof Q1–Q4 away from the bases of Q5–Q8 and to ac groundthrough low impedances. The two-pole high pass frequencyresponse of the T switch formed by these clamps is a significantimprovement over the one-pole high pass response of a simpleseries CMOS switch. As a result, board and package parasitics,especially stray capacitance between inputs and outputs maylimit the achievable crosstalk and off isolation.\nLAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS:\nRealizing the high speed performance attainable with theAD8180 and AD8182 requires careful attention to board layoutand component selection. Proper RF design techniques and lowparasitic component selection are mandatory.\nWire wrap boards, prototype boards, and sockets are not recom-\nmended because of their high parasitic inductance and capaci-tance. Instead, surface-mount components should be soldereddirectly to a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB should havea ground plane covering all unused portions of the componentside of the board  to provide a low impedance ground path. Theground plane should be removed from the area near input andoutput pins to reduce stray capacitance.\nChip capacitors should be used for supply bypassing. One end\nof the capacitor should be connected to the ground plane andthe other within 1/4 inch of each power pin. An additional large(4.7 mF–10 mF) tantalum capacitor should be connected in\nparallel with each of the smaller capacitors for low impedancesupply bypassing over a broad range of frequencies.\nSignal traces should be as short as possible. Stripline or micros-\ntrip techniques should be used for long signal traces (longerthan about 1 inch). These should be designed with a character-istic impedance of 50 W or 75 W and be properly terminated at\nthe end using surface mount components.\nCareful layout is imperative to minimize crosstalk. Guards\n(ground or supply traces) must be run between all signal tracesto limit direct capacitive coupling. Input and output signal linesshould fan out away from the mux as much as possible. If mul-tiple signal layers are available, a buried stripline structure hav-ing ground plane above, below, and between signal traces willhave the best crosstalk performance.\nReturn currents flowing through termination resistors can also\nincrease crosstalk if these currents flow in sections of the finite-impedance ground circuit that is shared between more than oneinput or output. Minimizing the inductance and resistance of theground plane can reduce this effect, but further care should betaken in positioning the terminations. Terminating cables directlyat the connectors will minimize the return current flowing on theboard, but the signal trace between the connector and the mux willlook like an open stub and will degrade the frequency response.Moving the termination resistors close to the input pins will im-prove the frequency response, but the terminations from neigh-\nboring inputs should not have a common ground return.THEORY OF OPERATION\nThe AD8180 and AD8182 video multiplexers are designed forfast-switching (10 ns) and wide bandwidth (> 750 MHz). Thisperformance is attained with low power dissipation (3.8 mA peractive channel) through the use of proprietary circuit techniquesand a dielectrically-isolated complementary bipolar process.These devices have a fast disable function that allows the out-puts of several muxes to be wired in parallel to form a larger muxwith little degradation in switching time. The low disabled outputcapacitance (1.7 pF) of these muxes helps to preserve the systembandwidth in larger matrices. Unlike earlier  CMOS switches,the switched open-loop buffer architecture of the AD8180 andAD8182 provides a unidirectional signal path with minimal switch-ing glitches and constant, low input capacitance. Since the inputimpedance of these muxes is nearly independent of the load imped-ance and the state of the mux, the frequency response of the ONchannels in a large switch matrix is not affected by fanout.\nFigure 22 shows a block diagram and simplified schematic of the\nAD8180, which contains two switched buffers (S0 and S1) thatshare a common output. The decoder logic translates TTL-compatible logic inputs (SELECT and ENABLE ) to internal,\ndifferential ECL levels for fast, low-glitch switching.

The selected buffer is biased ON by fast\nswitched current sources that allow the buffer to turn on quickly.Dedicated flatness circuits, combined with the open-loop architec-ture of the AD8180 and AD8182, keep peaking low (typically< 1 dB) when driving high capacitive loads, with out the need for\nexternal series resistors at the input or output. If better flatnessresponse is desired, an input series resistance (R\nS) may be used\n(refer to Figure 20), although this will increase crosstalk. The dcgain of the AD8180 and AD8182 is almost independent of load\nAD8180/AD8182\n–8– REV. BAPPLICATIONS\nMultiplexing two RGB Video Sources\nA common video application requires two RGB sources to be\nmultiplexed together before the selected signal is applied to amonitor. Typically one source would be the PC’s normal output,the second source might be a specialized source such as MPEGvideo. Figure 23 shows how such a circuit could be realizedusing the AD8180 and  AD8182 and three current feedback opamps. The video inputs to the multiplexers are terminated with75 W resistors. This has the effect of halving the signal amplitude\nof the applied signals.\nBecause all three multiplexers are permanen tly active, the\nENABLE  pins are tied permanently low. The three SELECT\npins are tied together and this signal is used to select the source.In order to drive a 75 W back terminated load (R\nL  = 150 W), the\nmultiplexer outputs are buffered using the AD8001 current feed-back op amp. A gain of two compensates for the signal halving bythe AD8001 output back termination resistor so that the systemhas an overall gain of unity.\nIf lower speed and crosstalk can be tolerated, either of the triple\nop amps, AD8013 or AD8073, can replace the three AD8001 opamps in the above circuit.  Because both devices have bandwidthsin the 100 MHz to 140 MHz range at a gain of  +2, these ampli-fiers will dominate the frequency response of the circuit.With no signal present, the total quiescent current of the cir-\ncuit in Figure 23 is 25.6 mA (3.8 mA + 6.8 mA + 3 · 5 mA), or\nabout 8.5 mA per channel. If either the AD8013 or AD8073are used, the quiescent current will decrease to about 6.5 mAper channel.\nTo reduce power consumption further, three AD8011 single\nop amps can be used. With a quiescent current of 1 mA, thiswill reduce the per channel quiescent current to about 4.5 mA.\nTable II.

Multiplexing Two Component Video Sources\nAD8180/AD8182\n–9– REV. BPicture-in-Picture or Pixel Switching\nMany high end display systems require simultaneous display of\ntwo video pictures (from two different sources) on one screen.Video conferencing is one such example. In this case the remotesite might be displayed as the main picture with a picture of thelocal site “inset” for monitoring purposes. The circuit in Fig-ure 23 could also be used to implement this “picture-in-picture”application.\nImplementing a picture-in-picture algorithm is difficult for\nseveral reasons. Both sources are being displayed simultaneously(i.e., during the same frame), both sources are in real time, andboth must be synchronized.  Figure 24 shows the raster scan-ning that takes place in all monitors. During every horizontalscan that includes part of the inset, the source must be switchedtwice (i.e., from main to inset and from inset to main). To avoidscreen artifacts, it is critical that switching is clean and fast. TheAD8180 and AD8182, in the above application, switch and\nsettle to 0.1% accuracy in 14 ns. We quadratically add this\nvalue to the 10 ns settling time of the AD8001, and get an over-all settling time of 17.2 ns. This yields a sharp, artifact-freeborder between the inset and the main video.\nINSET VIDEO\nMULTIPLEXER MUST SWITCH\nCLEANLY ON EACH CROSSINGMAIN VIDEO\nFigure 24. “Picture-in-Picture,” Pixel Switching\nColor Document Scanner\nFigure 25  shows a block diagram of a Color Document Scan-\nner. Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) find widespread use inscanner applications. A monochrome CCD delivers a serialstream of voltage levels, each level being proportional to thelight shining on that cell. In the case of the color image scannershown, there are three output streams, representing red, greenand blue. Interlaced with the stream of voltage levels is a voltagerepresenting the reset level (or black level) of each cell. A Corre-lated Double Sampler (CDS) subtracts these two voltages fromeach other in order to eliminate the relatively large offsets whichare common with CCDs.CONTROL AND TIMING\nAD876 8/10-BIT\n20MSPS\nA/DAD8182OUT A\nOUT BCDS\nCDS\nCDS\nREFERENCER\nG\nBC\nCDIN0 A\nIN1 A\nIN1 B\nIN0 B100V\n4:1 MUX TRUTH TABLE\nSEL A, SEL B ENA, ENBOUTA, OUTB\n0\n0110\n101IN0A\nIN0BIN1AIN1BEN A\nEN BSEL A\nSEL B\nFigure 25. Color Document Scanner\nThe next step in the data acquisition process involves digitizing\nthe three signal streams. Assuming that the analog to digitalconverter chosen has a  fast enough sample rate, multiplexingthe three streams into a single ADC is generally more eco-nomic than using one ADC per channel. In the exampleshown, we use the two 2-to-1 multiplexers in the AD8182 tocreate a 4-to-1 multiplexer. The enable control pins on themultiplexers allow the outputs to be wired directly together.\nBecause of its high bandwidth, the AD8182 is capable of driv-\ning the switched capacitor input stage of the AD876 withoutadditional buffering. In addition to having the required thebandwidth, it is necessary to consider the settling time of themultiplexer. In this case, the ADC has a sample rate of 20 MHz\nwhich corresponds to a sam pling period of 50 ns. Typically,\none phase of the sampling clock is used for conversion (i.e., alllevels are held steady) and the other phase is used for switch-ing and settling to the next channel. Assuming a 50% duty cycle,the signal chain must settle within 25 ns. With a settling time to\n0.1% of 14 ns, the multiplexer easily satisfies this criterion.\nIn the example shown, the fourth (spare) channel of the\nAD8182 is used to measure a reference voltage. This voltagewould probably be measured less frequently than the R, G andB signals. Multiplexing a reference voltage offers the advantagethat any temperature drift effects caused by the multiplexerwill equally impact the reference voltage and the to-be-\nmeasured signals. If the fourth channel is unused, it is gooddesign practice to tie this input to ground.\nAD8180/AD8182\n–10– REV. BEVALUATION BOARD\nEvaluation boards for the AD8180R and AD8182R are available\nwhich have been carefully laid out and tested to demonstrate thespecified high speed performance of the devices. Figure 26 andFigure 27 show the schematics of the AD8180 and AD8182evaluation boards respectively. For ordering information, pleaserefer to the Ordering Guide.\nBecause the footprint of the AD8180 fits directly on to that of\nthe AD8182, one board layout can be used for both devices. In thecase of  the AD 8180, only the top half of the board is populated.\nFigure 28 shows the silkscreen of the component side and Fig-\nure 30 shows the silkscreen of the solder side. Figures 29 and 31show the layout of the component side and solder side respectively.The evaluation board is provided with 49.9 W termination resis-\ntors on all inputs. This is to allow the performance to be evalu-ated at very high frequencies where 50 W termination is most\npopular. To use the evaluation board in video applications, thetermination resistors should be replaced with 75 W resistors.\nThe multiplexer outputs are loaded with 4.99 k W resistors. In\norder to avoid large gain errors, these load resistors should begreater than or equal to 1 k W. For connection to external instru-\nments, oscilloscope scope probe adapters are provided. Thisallows direct connection of FET probes to the board. For verifi-cation of data sheet specifications, use of FET probes with abandwidth > 1 GHz is recommended because of their low inputcapacitance. The probe adapters used on the board have thesame footprint as SMA, SMB and SMC type connectors allow-ing easy replacement if necessary.\n8\n765\n+VS\nC4\n10mFC1\n0.1mFR10\n49.9 V1\n2\n34\nAD8180RDECODER+1\n+1\n+R1\n49.9 V\nIN1IN0SELECT\nR9\n49.9 VENABLE\nR8\n49.9 V\n+–VS\nC3\n10mFC2\n0.1mFR7\n4.99k VOUT\n(SCOPE PROBE\nADAPTER)\nUNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, CONNECTORS ARE SMA TYPE\nFigure 26.

AD8180R/AD8182R Evaluation Board inputs are configured\nwith 50 W impedance striplines. This FR4 board type has the\nfollowing stripline dimensions: 60-mil width, 12-mil gapbetween center conductor and outside ground plane “is-lands,” and 62-mil board thickness.\n2. Several types of SMA connectors can be mounted on this\nboard: the side-mount type, which can be easily installed atthe edges of the board, and the top-mount type, which isplaced on top. When using the top-mount SMA connector, itis recommended that the stripline on the outside 1/8" of theboard edge be removed with an X-Acto blade as this unusedstripline acts as an open stub, which could degrade the small-signal frequency response of the mux.3. Input termination resistor placement on the evaluation board\nis critical to reducing crosstalk. Each termination resistor isoriented so that ground return currents flow counterclock-wise to a ground plane “island.” Although the direction ofthis ground current flow is arbitrary, it is important that notwo input or output termination resistors share a connectionto the same ground “island.”\nAD8180/AD8182\n–12– REV.
