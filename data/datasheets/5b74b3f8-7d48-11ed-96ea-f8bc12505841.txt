A | Page 3  of 48 | August 2006GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADSP-218xN series consists of six single chip microcom-\nputers optimized for digital signal processing applications. The \nhigh-level block diagram for the ADSP-218xN series members \nappears on the previous page. All series members are pin-com-\npatible and are differentiated solely by the amount of on-chip \nSRAM. This feature, combined with ADSP-21xx code compati-\nbility, provides a great deal of flexibility in the design decision. \nSpecific family members are shown in Table 1 .\nADSP-218xN series members co mbine the ADSP-2100 family \nbase architecture (three comput ational units, data address gen-\nerators, and a program sequencer) with two serial ports, a 16-bit \ninternal DMA port, a byte DMA port, a programmable timer, \nFlag I/O, extensive interrupt ca pabilities, and on-chip program \nand data memory.\nADSP-218xN series members inte grate up to 256K bytes of on-\nchip memory configured as up  to 48K words (24-bit) of pro-\ngram RAM, and up to 56K words (16-bit) of data RAM. Power-\ndown circuitry is also provided to meet the low power needs of \nbattery-operated portable eq uipment. The ADSP-218xN is \navailable in a 100-lead LQ FP package and 144-ball BGA.\nFabricated in a high-speed, low- power, 0.18 μm CMOS process, \nADSP-218xN series members oper ate with a 12.5 ns instruction \ncycle time. Every instruction can execute in a single pro-\ncessor cycle.\nThe ADSP-218xN’s flexible arch itecture and comprehensive \ninstruction set allow the proce ssor to perform multiple opera-\ntions in parallel. In one proc essor cycle, ADSP-218xN series \nmembers can:\n• Generate the next program address\n• Fetch the next instruction\n• Perform one or two data moves\n• Update one or two data address pointers\n• Perform a computational operation\nThis takes place while the processor continues to:\n• Receive and transmit data through the two serial ports\n• Receive and/or transmit data through the internal \nDMA port• Receive and/or transmit data through the byte DMA port\n• Decrement timer\nARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW\nThe ADSP-218xN series instructio n set provides flexible data \nmoves and multifunction (one or two data moves with a com-putation) instructions. Every instruction can be executed in a \nsingle processor cycle. The ADSP-218xN assembly language \nuses an algebraic syntax for ease of coding and readability. A comprehensive set of development tools supports program \ndevelopment.\nThe functional block diagram is an overall block diagram of the \nADSP-218xN series. The processo r contains thre e independent \ncomputational units: the ALU,  the multiplier/accumulator \n(MAC), and the shifter. The comp utational units process 16-bit \ndata directly and have provisions to support multiprecision computations. The ALU performs a standard set of arithmetic \nand logic operations; division pr imitives are also supported. The \nMAC performs single-cycle mult iply, multiply/add, and multi-\nply/subtract operations with 40 bits of accumulation. The shifter \nperforms logical and arithmetic shifts, normalization, denor-\nmalization, and derive exponent operations.\nThe shifter can be used to effi ciently implement numeric format \ncontrol, including multiword and block floating-point \nrepresentations.\nThe internal result (R) bus conn ects the computational units so \nthat the output of any unit may be the input of any unit on the \nnext cycle.\nA powerful program sequencer and two dedicated data address \ngenerators ensure efficient delivery of operands to these compu-tational units. The sequence r supports conditional jumps, \nsubroutine calls, and returns in a single cycle. With internal \nloop counters and loop stac ks, ADSP-218xN series members \nexecute looped code with zero overhead; no explicit jump \ninstructions are required to maintain loops.\nTwo data address generators (DAGs) provide addresses for \nsimultaneous dual operand fetches (from data memory and pro-gram memory). Each DAG mainta ins and updates four address \npointers. Whenever the pointer is  used to access data (indirect \naddressing), it is post-modified by  the value of one of four possi-\nble modify registers. A length va lue may be associated with each \npointer to implement automatic modulo addressing for \ncircular buffers.\nFive internal buses provide efficient data transfer:\n• Program Memory Address (PMA) Bus\n• Program Memory Data (PMD) Bus\n• Data Memory Address (DMA) Bus\n• Data Memory Data (DMD) Bus\n• Result (R) BusTable 1.

A | Page 4  of 48 | August 2006ADSP-218xN\nThe two address buses (PMA and DMA) share a single external \naddress bus, allowing memory to be expanded off-chip, and the \ntwo data buses (PMD and DMD) share a single external data \nbus. Byte memory space and I/ O memory space also share the \nexternal buses.\nProgram memory can store both instructions and data, permit-\nting ADSP-218xN series members to fetch two operands in a \nsingle cycle, one from program memory and one from data \nmemory. ADSP-218xN series me mbers can fetch an operand \nfrom program memory and the next instruction in the \nsame cycle.\nIn lieu of the address and data bus for external memory connec-\ntion, ADSP-218xN series members may be configured for 16-bit \nInternal DMA port (IDMA port) connection to external sys-\ntems. The IDMA port is made up of 16 data/address pins and \nfive control pins. The IDMA port provides transparent, direct \naccess to the DSP’s on-chi p program and data RAM.\nAn interface to low-cost byte-w ide memory is provided by the \nByte DMA port (BDMA port). Th e BDMA port is bidirectional \nand can directly address up to four megabytes of external RAM \nor ROM for off-chip storage of program overlays or data tables.\nThe byte memory and I/O memory space interface supports \nslow memories and I/O memory-mapped peripherals with pro-\ngrammable wait state generation . External devices can gain \ncontrol of external buses with  bus request/grant signals (BR , \nBGH , and BG ). One execution mode (Go Mode) allows the \nADSP-218xN to continue runnin g from on-chip memory. Nor-\nmal execution mode requires the processor to halt while buses \nare granted.\nADSP-218xN series members can re spond to eleven interrupts. \nThere can be up to six external  interrupts (one edge-sensitive, \ntwo level-sensitive, and three configurable) and seven internal \ninterrupts generated by the timer, the serial ports (SPORT), the \nBDMA port, and the power-down circuitry. There is also a mas-ter RESET\n signal. The two serial ports provide a complete \nsynchronous serial interface with optional companding in hard-\nware and a wide variety of fram ed or frameless data transmit \nand receive modes of operation.\nEach port can generate  an internal programmable serial clock or \naccept an external serial clock.\nADSP-218xN series members prov ide up to 13 general-purpose \nflag pins. The data input and output pins on SPORT1 can be alternatively configured as an in put flag and an output flag. In \naddition, eight flags are programmable as inputs or outputs, and \nthree flags are always outputs.\nA programmable interval timer ge nerates periodic interrupts. A \n16-bit count register (TCOUNT) decrements every n processor \ncycle, where n is a scaling value stored in an 8-bit register \n(TSCALE). When the value of th e count register reaches zero, \nan interrupt is generated and the count register is reloaded from \na 16-bit period register (TPERIOD).Serial Ports\nADSP-218xN series members in corporate two complete syn-\nchronous serial ports (SPO RT0 and SPORT1) for serial \ncommunications and mult iprocessor communication.\nFollowing is a brief list of th e capabilities of the ADSP-218xN \nSPORTs. For additional information on Serial Ports, refer to the \nADSP-218x DSP Hardware Reference .\n• SPORTs are bidirectional and have a separate, double-\nbuffered transmit and receive section.\n• SPORTs can use an external serial clock or generate their \nown serial clock internally.\n• SPORTs have independent framing for the receive and \ntransmit sections. Sections run in a frameless mode or with \nframe synchronization signals in ternally or externally gen-\nerated. Frame sync signals are active high or inverted, with \neither of two pulsewidths and timings.\n• SPORTs support serial data wo rd lengths from 3 bits to \n16 bits and provide optional A-law and μ-law companding, \naccording to CCITT recommendation G.711.\n• SPORT receive and transmit sections can generate unique \ninterrupts on completing a data word transfer.\n• SPORTs can receive and transmit  an entire circular buffer \nof data with only one overhead cycle per data word. An \ninterrupt is generated afte r a data buffer transfer.\n• SPORT0 has a multichannel interface to selectively receive \nand transmit a 24 word or 32-word, time-division multi-\nplexed, serial bitstream.\n• SPORT1 can be configured to have two external interrupts \n(IRQ0  and IRQ1 ) and the FI and FO signals. The internally \ngenerated serial clock may still be used in this \nconfiguration.\nADSP-218xN\nRev. A | Page 5  of 48 | August 2006MODES OF OPERATION\nThe ADSP-218xN series modes of operation appear in Table 2 .\nSetting Memory Mode\nMemory Mode select ion for the ADSP-218x N series is made \nduring chip reset through the use of the Mode C pin. This pin is \nmultiplexed with the DSP’s PF2 pi n, so care must be taken in \nhow the mode selection is made . The two methods for selecting \nthe value of Mode C are active and passive.\nPassive Configuration\nPassive Configuration involves the use of a pull-up or pull-\ndown resistor connected to the Mode C pin. To minimize power \nconsumption, or if the PF2 pin is to be used as an output in the \nDSP application, a weak pull-up or pull-down resistance, on the order of 10 k Ω, can be used. This value should be sufficient to \npull the pin to the desired level an d still allow the pin to operate \nas a programmable flag output without undue strain on the pro-\ncessor’s output driver. For minimum power consumption \nduring power-down, reconfigure PF 2 to be an input, as the pull-\nup or pull-down resistance will hold the pin in a known state, \nand will not switch.\nActive Configuration\nActive Configuration involves th e use of a three-statable exter-\nnal driver connected to the Mode C pin. A driver’s output \nenable should be connec ted to the DSP’s RESET  signal such that \nit only drives the PF2 pin when RESET  is active (low). When \nRESET  is deasserted, the driver sh ould be three-state, thus \nallowing full use of the PF2 pin as either an input or output. To \nminimize power consumption during power-down, configure the programmable flag as an output when connected to a three-\nstated buffer. This ensures that th e pin will be held at a constant \nlevel, and will not oscillate should  the three-state driver’s level \nhover around the logic switching point.\nIDMA ACK Configuration\nMode D = 0 and in host mode: IACK  is an active, driven signal \nand cannot be “wire-OR’ed.” Mode D = 1 and in host mode: \nIACK  is an open drain and requir es an external pull-down, but \nmultiple IACK  pins can be “wire-OR’ed” together.\nINTERRUPTS\nThe interrupt controller allows th e processor to respond to the \neleven possible interrupts and reset with minimum overhead. \nADSP-218xN series members prov ide four dedica ted external \ninterrupt input pins: IRQ2 , IRQL0 , IRQL1 , and IRQE  (shared \nwith the PF7–4 pins). In addi tion, SPORT1 may be reconfig-\nured for IRQ0 , IRQ1 , FI, and FO, for a total of six external \ninterrupts. The ADSP-218xN also supports internal  interrupts \nfrom the timer, the byte DMA port, the two serial ports, soft-\nware, and the power-down control circuit. The interrupt levels \nare internally prioritized and individually maskable (except \npower-down and reset). The IRQ2 , IRQ0 , and IRQ1  input pins \ncan be programmed to be either level- or edge-sensitive. IRQL0  \nand IRQL1  are level-sensitive and IRQE  is edge-sensitive. The \npriorities and vector addresses of all interrupts are shown in \nTable 3 .Table 2.

A | Page 6  of 48 | August 2006ADSP-218xN\nInterrupt routines can either be  nested with hi gher priority \ninterrupts taking precedence or  processed sequentially. Inter-\nrupts can be masked or unmask ed with the IMASK register. \nIndividual interrupt requests are logically ANDed with the bits \nin IMASK; the highest priority unmasked interrupt is then \nselected. The power-down interrupt is nonmaskable.\nADSP-218xN series members ma sk all interrupts for one \ninstruction cycle following the execution of an instruction that \nmodifies the IMASK register. This  does not affect serial port \nautobuffering or DMA transfers.\nThe interrupt control register, IC NTL, controls interrupt nest-\ning and defines the IRQ0 , IRQ1 , and IRQ2  external interrupts to \nbe either edge- or level-sensitive. The IRQE  pin is an external \nedge-sensitive interrupt and ca n be forced and cleared. The \nIRQL0  and IRQL1  pins are external level sensitive interrupts.\nThe IFC register is a write-only register used to force and clear \ninterrupts. On-chip stacks preser ve the processor status and are \nautomatically maintained during interrupt handling. The stacks are 12 levels deep to allow interr upt, loop, and subroutine nest-\ning. The following instructions allow global enable or disable \nservicing of the interrupts (inc luding power-down), regardless \nof the state of IMASK:\nENA INTS;\nDIS INTS;\nDisabling the interrupts does not affect serial port autobuffering \nor DMA. When the processor is  reset, interrupt servicing \nis enabled.\nLOW-POWER OPERATION\nADSP-218xN series members have  three low-power modes that \nsignificantly reduce the power di ssipation when the device oper-\nates under standby conditions. These modes are:\n• Power-Down\n•I d l e\n• Slow IdleThe CLKOUT pin may also be di sabled to reduce external \npower dissipation.\nPower-Down\nADSP-218xN series members have a low-power feature that lets \nthe processor enter a very lo w-power dormant state through \nhardware or software control. Fo llowing is a brie f list of power-\ndown features. Refer to the ADSP-218x DSP Ha rdware Refer-\nence , “System Interface” chapter, for detailed information about \nthe power-down feature.\n• Quick recovery from power- down. The processor begins \nexecuting instructions in as few as 200 CLKIN cycles.\n• Support for an externally generated TTL or CMOS proces-\nsor clock. The external clock can continue running during \npower-down without affecting the lowest power rating and \n200 CLKIN cycle recovery.\n• Support for crystal operation includes disabling the oscilla-\ntor to save power (the pr ocessor automatically waits \napproximately 4096 CLKIN cycles  for the crystal oscillator \nto start or stabilize), and letting the oscillator run to allow \n200 CLKIN cycle start-up.\n• Power-down is initiated by either the power-down pin \n(PWD ) or the software power-do wn force bit. Interrupt \nsupport allows an unlimited nu mber of instructions to be \nexecuted before optionally  powering down. The power-\ndown interrupt also can be used as a nonmaskable, edge-\nsensitive interrupt.\n• Context clear/save control allo ws the processor to continue \nwhere it left off or start with  a clean context when leaving \nthe power-down state.\n•T h e  R E S E T  pin also can be used to terminate power-down. \n• Power-down acknowledge pin (PWDACK) indicates when \nthe processor has entered power-down.\nIdle\nWhen the ADSP-218xN is in the Idle Mode, the processor waits \nindefinitely in a low-power st ate until an interrupt occurs. \nWhen an unmasked interrupt occu rs, it is serviced; execution \nthen continues with the instruct ion following the IDLE instruc-\ntion. In Idle mode IDMA, BDMA , and autobuffer cycle steals \nstill occur.\nSlow Idle\nThe IDLE instruction is enhanced on ADSP-218xN series mem-\nbers to let the processor’s internal  clock signal be slowed, further \nreducing power consumption. The reduced clock frequency, a \nprogrammable fraction of the norm al clock rate, is specified by a \nselectable divisor given in the IDLE instruction.\nThe format of the instruction is:\nIDLE (n);\nwhere n = 16, 32, 64, or 128. This instruction keeps the proces-\nsor fully functional, but operating at the slower clock rate. While \nit is in this state, the processo r’s other internal clock signals, Table 3.

A | Page 7  of 48 | August 2006such as SCLK, CLKOUT, and timer clock, are reduced by the \nsame ratio. The default form of the instruction, when no clock \ndivisor is given, is the standard IDLE instruction.\nWhen the IDLE (n) instruction is used, it effectively slows down \nthe processor’s internal clock an d thus its response time to \nincoming interrupts. The one-cycl e response time of the stan-\ndard idle state is increased by n, the clock divisor. When an enabled interrupt is received , ADSP-218xN series members \nremain in the idle state for up to a maximum of n processor \ncycles (n = 16, 32, 64, or 128) before resuming nor-\nmal operation.\nWhen the IDLE (n) instruction is used in systems that have an \nexternally generated serial clock (SCLK), the serial clock rate \nmay be faster than the processor’s reduced internal clock rate. Under these conditions, interrupts must not be generated at a faster rate than can be serviced, due to the additional time the \nprocessor takes to come out of the idle state (a maximum of n \nprocessor cycles).\nSYSTEM INTERFACE\nFigure 2  shows typical basic system  configurations with the \nADSP-218xN series, two serial devices, a byte-wide EPROM, \nand optional external program and data overlay memories (mode-selectable). Programmable wait state generation allows \nthe processor to connect easily to slow peripheral devices. \nADSP-218xN series members also provide four external inter-\nrupts and two serial ports or six external interrupts and one \nserial port. Host Memory Mode a llows access to the full external \ndata bus, but limits addressing  to a single address bit (A0). \nThrough the use of external hardware, additional system \nperipherals can be added in this mode to generate and latch \naddress signals.\nFigure 2.

For additional information, refer to the ADSP-218x \nDSP Hardware Reference , for detailed information on this \npower-down feature.\nIf an external clock is used, it should be a TTL-compatible signal \nrunning at half the instruction rate. The signal is connected to \nthe processor’s CLKIN input. When  an external clock is used, \nthe XTAL pin must be left unconnected.\nADSP-218xN series members use an input clock with a fre-\nquency equal to half the instru ction rate; a 40 MHz input clock \nyields a 12.5  ns processor cycl e (which is equivalent to \n80 MHz). Normally, instructions are executed in a single pro-\ncessor cycle. All device timing is relative to the internal instruc-\ntion clock rate, which is indi cated by the CLKOUT signal \nwhen enabled.\nBecause ADSP-218xN series memb ers include an on-chip oscil-\nlator circuit, an external crysta l may be used. The crystal should \nbe connected across the CLKIN and XTAL pins, with two capacitors connected as shown in Figure 3 . Capacitor values are \ndependent on crystal type and should be specified by the crystal \nmanufacturer. A parallel-resona nt, fundamental frequency, \nmicroprocessor-grade crystal sh ould be used. To provide an \nadequate feedback path around the internal amplifier circuit, \nplace a resistor in parallel with the circuit, as shown in Figure 3 .\nA clock output (CLKOUT) signal is generated by the processor \nat the processor’s cycle rate. This can be enabled and disabled by \nthe CLKODIS bit in the SPORT0 Autobuffer Control Register.\nRESET\nThe RESET  signal initiates a master  reset of the ADSP-218xN. \nThe RESET  signal must be assert ed during the power-up \nsequence to assure prop er initialization. RESET  during initial \npower-up must be held long enou gh to allow the internal clock \nto stabilize. If RESET  is activated any time after power-up, the \nclock continues to run and does not require stabilization time.\nThe power-up sequence is defined as the total time required for \nthe crystal oscillator circuit to stabilize after a valid V DD is \napplied to the processor, and for the internal phase-locked loop \n(PLL) to lock onto the specific crystal frequency. A minimum of 2000 CLKIN cycles ensures that the PLL has locked, but does \nnot include the crystal oscillator start-up time. During this \npower-up sequence the RESET  signal should be held low. On \nany subsequent resets, the RESET  signal must meet the mini-\nmum pulse-width specification (t RSP).\nThe RESET  input contains some hysteresis; however, if an RC \ncircuit is used to generate the RESET  signal, the use of an exter-\nnal Schmitt trigger is recommended.\nThe master reset sets all internal stack pointers to the empty \nstack condition, masks all inte rrupts, and clears the MSTAT \nregister. When RESET  is released, if there is no pending bus \nrequest and the chip is configured  for booting, the boot-loading \nsequence is performed. The first instruction is fetched from on-\nchip program memory locati on 0x0000 once boot loading \ncompletes.\nPOWER SUPPLIES\nADSP-218xN series members have  separate power supply con-\nnections for the internal (V DDINT ) and external (V DDEXT ) power \nsupplies. The internal supply must  meet the 1.8 V requirement. \nThe external supply can be connected to a 1.8 V, 2.5 V, or 3.3 V \nsupply. All external supply pins must be connected to the same \nsupply. All input and I/O pins can tolerate input voltages up to \n3.6 V, regardless of the external supply voltage. This feature pro-vides maximum flexibility in mi xing 1.8 V, 2.5 V, or 3.3 V \ncomponents.\nFigure 3. External Crystal ConnectionsCLKIN CLKOUT XTAL\nDSP1M/H9024\nADSP-218xN\nRev.

A | Page 11  of 48 | August 2006Program Memory (Host Mode) a llows access to all internal \nmemory. External overlay access is limited by a single external \naddress line (A0). External program execution is not available in \nhost mode due to a restricted data bus that is only 16 bits wide.\nData Memory\nData Memory (Full Memory Mode) is a 16-bit-wide space used \nfor the storage of data variab les and for memory-mapped con-\ntrol registers. The ADSP-218xN series has up to 56K words of \nData Memory RAM on-chip. Part of this space is used by 32 \nmemory-mapped registers. Support also exists for up to two 8K \nexternal memory overlay spaces through the external data bus.All internal accesses complete in one cycle. Accesses to external \nmemory are timed using the wait states specified by the DWAIT \nregister and the wait state mode bit.\nData Memory (Host Mode) allows access to all internal mem-\nory. External overlay access is limited by a single external \naddress line (A0).\nMemory-Mapped Registers (New to the ADSP-218xM and \nN series)\nADSP-218xN series members ha ve three memo ry-mapped reg-\nisters that differ from other AD SP-21xx Family DSPs. The slight \nmodifications to these register s (Wait State Control, Program-\nmable Flag and Composite Select Control, and System Control) \nprovide the ADSP-218xN’ s wait state and BMS  control features. \nDefault bit values at reset are shown; if no value is shown, the bit is undefined at reset. Reserved bits are shown on a grey field. \nThese bits should always be written with zeros. I/O Space (Full Memory Mode)\nADSP-218xN series members suppo rt an additional external \nmemory space called I/O space. Th is space is designed to sup-\nport simple connections to periph erals (such as data converters \nand external registers) or to bu s interface ASIC data registers. \nI/O space supports 2048 locations of  16-bit wide data. The lower \neleven bits of the external address bus are used; the upper three \nbits are undefined.\nTwo instructions were added to the core ADSP-2100 Family \ninstruction set to read from and write to I/O memory space. The \nI/O space also has four dedicated three-bit wait st ate registers, Table 4.

The wait states act \non address ranges, as shown in Table 6 .\nNote : In Full Memory Mode, all 2048 locations of I/O space are \ndirectly addressable.  In Host Memory Mode, only address pin \nA0 is available; therefore, additi onal logic is required externally \nto achieve complete addr essability of the 2048 I/O \nspace locations.\nComposite Memory Select\nADSP-218xN series members ha ve a programmable memory \nselect signal that is useful for generating memory select signals \nfor memories mapped to more  than one space. The CMS  signal \nis generated to have the same timing as each of the individual \nmemory select signals (PMS , DMS , BMS , IOMS ) but can com-\nbine their functionality. Each bit in the CMSSEL register, when \nset, causes the CMS  signal to be asserted when the selected \nmemory select is asserted. For example, to use a 32K word memory to act as both progra m and data memory, set the PMS\n \nand DMS  bits in the CMSSEL register and use the CMS  pin to \ndrive the chip select of the memory, and use either DMS  or PMS  \nas the additional address bit.\nThe CMS  pin functions like the ot her memory select signals \nwith the same timing and bus request logic. A 1 in the enable bit \ncauses the assertion of the CMS  signal at the same time as the \nselected memory select signal. A ll enable bits default to 1 at \nreset, except the BMS  bit.\nSee Figure 11  and Figure 12  for illustration of the programma-\nble flag and composite contro l register and the system \ncontrol register.\nByte Memory Select\nThe ADSP-218xN’s BMS  disable feature combined with the \nCMS  pin allows use of multiple memories in the byte memory \nspace. For example, an EPROM could be attached to the BMS  select, and a flash memory could be connected to CMS . Because \nat reset BMS  is enabled, the EPROM would be used for booting. \nAfter booting, software could disable BMS  and set the CMS  sig-\nnal to respond to BMS , enabling the flash memory.\nByte Memory\nThe byte memory space is a bidirectional, 8-bit-wide, \nexternal memory space used to store programs and data. Byte \nmemory is accessed using the BD MA feature. The byte memory \nspace consists of 256 pages, each of which is 16K /H115478b i t s .\nThe byte memory space on th e ADSP-218xN series supports \nread and write operations as well as four different data formats. \nThe byte memory uses data bits 15–8 for data. The byte mem-ory uses data bits 23–16 and addre ss bits 13–0 to create a 22-bit \naddress. This allows up to a 4 megabit /H115478 (32 megabit) ROM \nor RAM to be used without glue logic. All byte memory accesses \nare timed by the BMWAIT register  and the wait state mode bit.\nByte Memory DMA (BDMA, Full Memory Mode)\nThe byte memory DMA controller ( Figure 13 ) allows loading \nand storing of program instruct ions and data using the byte \nmemory space. The BDMA circuit is able to access the byte \nmemory space while the processo r is operating normally and \nsteals only one DSP cycle per 8- , 16-, or 24-bit word transferred.Table 6.

A | Page 13  of 48 | August 2006The BDMA circuit supports four di fferent data formats that are \nselected by the BTYPE register field. The appropriate number of \n8-bit accesses are done from the byte memory space to build the \nword size selected. Table 7  shows the data formats supported by \nthe BDMA circuit.\nUnused bits in the 8-bit data me mory formats are filled with 0s. \nThe BIAD register field is used to  specify the starting address for \nthe on-chip memory involved with the transfer. The 14-bit \nBEAD register specifies the starti ng address for the external byte \nmemory space. The 8-bit BMPAGE  register specifies the start-\ning page for the external byte me mory space. The BDIR register \nfield selects the direction of the transfer. Finally, the 14-bit BWCOUNT register specifies th e number of DSP words to \ntransfer and initiates th e BDMA circuit transfers.\nBDMA accesses can cross page bo undaries during sequential \naddressing. A BDMA interrupt is generated on the completion \nof the number of tr ansfers specified by the BWCOUNT register.\nThe BWCOUNT register is updated after each transfer so it can \nbe used to check the status of the transfers. When it reaches \nzero, the transfers have finished  and a BDMA interrupt is gener-\nated. The BMPAGE and BEAD registers must not be accessed \nby the DSP during BDMA operations.\nThe source or destination of a BDMA transfer will always be on-\nchip program or data memory.When the BWCOUNT register is written with a nonzero value \nthe BDMA circuit starts executin g byte memory accesses with \nwait states set by BMWAIT. Th ese accesses continue until the \ncount reaches zero. When enough accesses have occurred to \ncreate a destination word, it is transferred to or from on-chip \nmemory. The transfer takes on e DSP cycle. DSP accesses to \nexternal memory have prio rity over BDMA byte mem-\nory accesses.The BDMA Context Reset bit (BCR) controls whether the pro-\ncessor is held off while the BDMA accesses are occurring. \nSetting the BCR bit to 0 allows the processor to continue opera-\ntions. Setting the BCR bit to 1 causes the processor to stop \nexecution while the BDMA accesse s are occurring, to clear the \ncontext of the processor, and st art execution at address 0 when \nthe BDMA accesses have completed.\nThe BDMA overlay bits specify the OVLAY memory blocks to \nbe accessed for internal memory. Set these bits as indicated in \nFigure 13 . \nNote : BDMA cannot access external overlay memory regions 1 \nand 2.\nThe BMWAIT field, which has fo ur bits on ADSP-218xN series \nmembers, allows selection up to 15 wait states for BDMA \ntransfers.\nInternal Memory DMA Port (IDMA Port; Host Memory \nMode)\nThe IDMA Port provides an e fficient means of communication \nbetween a host system and AD SP-218xN series members. The \nport is used to access the on -chip program memory and data \nmemory of the DSP with only one DSP cycle per word over-\nhead. The IDMA port ca nnot, however, be used to write to the \nDSP’s memory-mapped control registers. A typical IDMA \ntransfer process is shown as follows:\n1. Host starts IDMA transfer.\n2. Host checks IACK  control line to see if the DSP is busy.\n3. Host uses IS  and IAL control lines to latch either the DMA \nstarting address (IDMAA) or the PM/DM OVLAY selec-\ntion into the DSP’s IDMA cont rol registers. If Bit 15 = 1, \nthe values of Bits 7–0 repres ent the IDMA overlay; Bits \n14–8 must be set to 0. If Bit 15 = 0, the value of Bits 13–0 \nrepresent the starting address of internal memory to be \naccessed and Bit 14 reflects PM or DM for access. Set \nIDDMOVLAY and IDPMOVLAY bits in the IDMA over-\nlay register as indicted in Table 8 .\n4. Host uses IS  and IRD  (or IWR ) to read (or write) DSP \ninternal memory (PM or DM).\n5. Host checks IACK  line to see if the DSP has completed the \nprevious IDMA operation.\n6. Host ends IDMA transfer.Figure 13. BDMA Control Register\nTable 7.

A | Page 14  of 48 | August 2006ADSP-218xN\nThe IDMA port has a 16-bit mult iplexed address and data bus \nand supports 24-bit program memory. The IDMA port is com-\npletely asynchronous and can be  written while the ADSP-218xN \nis operating at full speed.\nThe DSP memory address is latched and then automatically \nincremented after each IDMA transaction. An external device \ncan therefore access a block of sequentially addressed memory \nby specifying only the starting  address of the block. This \nincreases throughput as the addre ss does not have to be sent for \neach memory access.\nIDMA port access occurs in two phases. The first is the IDMA \nAddress Latch cycle. When the acknowledge is asserted, a 14-bit \naddress and 1-bit destination type can be driven onto the bus by \nan external device. The addre ss specifies an on-chip memory \nlocation, the destination type specifies whether it is a DM or PM \naccess. The falling edge of the IDMA address latch signal (IAL) \nor the missing edge of th e IDMA select signal (IS ) latches this \nvalue into the IDMAA register.\nOnce the address is stored, data can be read from, or written to, \nthe ADSP-218xN’s on-chip memory. Asserting the select line \n(IS) and the appropriate read or write line (IRD  and IWR  \nrespectively) signals the ADSP- 218xN that a particular transac-\ntion is required. In either case , there is a one-processor-cycle \ndelay for synchronization. The memory access consumes one \nadditional processor cycle.\nOnce an access has occurred, th e latched address is automati-\ncally incremented, and another access can occur.\nThrough the IDMAA register, the DSP can also specify the \nstarting address and data format for DMA operation. \nAsserting the IDMA port select (IS ) and address latch enable \n(IAL) directs the ADSP-218xN to  write the address onto the \nIAD14–0 bus into the IDMA Control Register ( Figure 14 ). If Bit \n15 is set to 0, IDMA latches the address. If Bit 15 is set to 1, \nIDMA latches into the OVLAY re gister. This register, also \nshown in Figure 14 , is memory-mapped at address DM \n(0x3FE0). Note that the latched address (IDMAA) cannot be \nread back by the host.\nWhen Bit 14 in 0x3FE7 is set to zero, short reads use the timing \nshown in Figure 36 on Page 38 . When Bit 14 in 0x3FE7 is set to \n1, timing in Figure 37 on Page 39  applies for short reads in short \nread only mode. Set IDDMOVLAY and IDPMOVLAY bits in the IDMA overlay regist er as indicated in Table 8 . Refer to the  \nADSP-218x DSP Hardware Reference  for additional details.\nNote : In full memory mode all lo cations of 4M-byte memory \nspace are directly addressable.  In host memory mode, only \naddress pin A0 is available, requiring additional external logic to \nprovide address information for the byte. \nBootstrap Loading (Booting)\nADSP-218xN series members have  two mechanisms to allow \nautomatic loading of the internal program memory after reset. \nThe method for booting is controlled by the Mode A, B, and C \nconfiguration bits.\nWhen the mode pins specify BDMA booting, the ADSP-218xN \ninitiates a BDMA boot sequence when reset is released.The BDMA interface is set up during reset to the following \ndefaults when BDMA booting is  specified: the BDIR, BMPAGE, \nBIAD, and BEAD registers are set to 0, the BTYPE register is set \nto 0 to specify program me mory 24-bit words, and the \nBWCOUNT register is set to 32. This causes 32 words of on-chip program memory to be loaded from byte memory. These \n32 words are used to set up the BDMA to load in  the remaining \nprogram code. The BCR bit is also set to 1, which causes pro-gram execution to be held off un til all 32 words are loaded into \non-chip program memory. Execution then begins at address 0.\nThe ADSP-2100 Family developm ent software (Revision 5.02 \nand later) fully supports the BDMA booting feature and can \ngenerate byte memory space-compatible boot code.\nThe IDLE instruction can also be used to allow the processor to \nhold off execution while bootin g continues thro ugh the BDMA \ninterface. For BDMA accesses while in Host Mode, the addres-ses to boot memory must be constructed externally to the \nADSP-218xN. The only memory address bit provided by the \nprocessor is A0.\nIDMA Port Booting\nADSP-218xN series members can also boot programs through \nits internal DMA port. If Mode C = 1, Mode B = 0, and Mode A = 1, the ADSP-218xN boots from the IDMA port. IDMA feature \ncan load as much on-chip memory as desired.

If the ADSP-218xN is not performing an external \nmemory access, it responds to the active BR  input in the follow-\ning processor cycle by: \n• Three-stating the data and address buses and the PMS , \nDMS , BMS , CMS , IOMS , RD , WR  output drivers,\n• Asserting the bus grant (BG ) signal, and\n• Halting program execution.\nIf Go Mode is enabled, the ADSP-218xN will not halt program \nexecution until it encounters an  instruction that requires an \nexternal memory access.\nIf an ADSP-218xN series member  is performing an external \nmemory access when the exte rnal device asserts the BR  signal, it \nwill not three-state the memory interfaces nor assert the BG  sig-\nnal until the processor cycle af ter the access completes. The \ninstruction does not need to be completed when the bus is \ngranted. If a single instructio n requires two external memory \naccesses, the bus will be granted between the two accesses.\nWhen the BR  signal is released, the processor releases the BG  \nsignal, re-enables the output drivers, and continues program \nexecution from the point at which it stopped.\nThe bus request feature operates at  all times, including when the \nprocessor is booting and when RESET  is active.\nThe BGH  pin is asserted when an  ADSP-218xN series member \nrequires the external bus for a memory or BDMA access, but is \nstopped. The other device can release the bus by deasserting bus request. Once the bus is rele ased, the ADSP-218xN deasserts BG\n \nand BGH  and executes the external memory access.\nFLAG I/O PINS\nADSP-218xN series members have  eight general-purpose pro-\ngrammable input/output flag pi ns. They are controlled by two \nmemory-mapped registers. The PFTYPE register determines \nthe direction, 1 = output and 0 = input. The PFDATA register is \nused to read and write the values  on the pins. Data being read \nfrom a pin configured as an input is synchronized to the \nADSP-218xN’s clock. Bits that  are programmed as outputs \nwill read the value being output. The PF pins default to input \nduring reset.\nIn addition to the programmab le flags, ADSP-218xN series \nmembers have five fixed-mode flags, FI, FO, FL0, FL1, and FL2. FL0 to FL2 are dedicated output flags. FI and FO are available as \nan alternate configuration of SPORT1.\nNote:  Pins PF0, PF1, PF2, and PF3 are also used for device con-\nfiguration during reset.INSTRUCTION SET DESCRIPTION\nThe ADSP-218xN series assembly language instruction set has \nan algebraic syntax that was designed for ease of coding and readability. The assembly language, which takes full advantage \nof the processor’s unique ar chitecture, offers the follow-\ning benefits:\n• The algebraic syntax elimin ates the need to remember \ncryptic assembler mnemonics. For example, a typical arith-\nmetic add instruction, such as  AR = AX0 + AY0, resembles \na simple equation.\n• Every instruction a ssembles into a single , 24-bit word that \ncan execute in a single instruction cycle.\n• The syntax is a superset AD SP-2100 Family assembly lan-\nguage and is completely source  and object code compatible \nwith other family members. Programs may need to be relocated to utilize on-chip memory and conform to the \nADSP-218xN’s interrupt vect or and reset vector map.\n• Sixteen condition codes are available. For conditional \njump, call, return, or arithmetic instructions, the condition can be checked and the operat ion executed in the same \ninstruction cycle.\n• Multifunction instructions a llow parallel execution of an \narithmetic instruction, with up to two fetches or one write \nto processor memory space, during a single instruc- \ntion cycle.\nDEVELOPMENT SYSTEM\nAnalog Devices’ wide range of software and hardware development tools supports th e ADSP-218xN series. The DSP \ntools include an integrated deve lopment environment, an evalu-\nation kit, and a serial port emulator.\nVisualDSP++®† is an integrated development environment, \nallowing for fast and easy development, debug, and deployment. \nThe VisualDSP++ project manage ment environment lets pro-\ngrammers develop and debug an application. This environment \nincludes an easy-to-use assembler that is based on an algebraic \nsyntax; an archiver (librarian /library builder); a linker; a \nPROM-splitter utility; a cycle-accurate, instruction-level simu-\nlator; a C compiler; and a C run-time library that includes DSP \nand mathematical functions.\nDebugging both C and assembly programs with the \nVisualDSP++ debugger, programmers can:\n• View mixed C and assembly code (interleaved source and \nobject information)\n• Insert break points• Set conditional breakpoints on registers, memory, and \nstacks\n• Trace instruction execution\n†VisualDSP++ is a registered trademark of Analog Devices, Inc.\nRev. A | Page 16  of 48 | August 2006ADSP-218xN\n• Fill and dump memory\n• Source level debugging\nThe VisualDSP++ IDE lets programmers define and manage \nDSP software development. The dialog boxes and property \npages let programmers configure and manage all of the ADSP-\n218xN development tools, includin g the syntax hi ghlighting in \nthe VisualDSP++ editor. This capability controls how the devel-\nopment tools process inputs and generate outputs.\nThe ADSP-2189M EZ-KIT Lite®† provides developers with a \ncost-effective method for initial evaluation of the powerful \nADSP-218xN DSP family archit ecture. The ADSP-2189M EZ-\nKIT Lite includes a stand-al one ADSP-2189M DSP board sup-\nported by an evaluation suite of VisualDSP++. With this EZ-\nKIT Lite, users can learn about DSP hardware and software \ndevelopment and evaluate potential applications of the ADSP-218xN series. The ADSP-2189M EZ-K IT Lite provides an evalu-\nation suite of the VisualDSP++ development environment with \nthe C compiler, assembler, and li nker. The size of the DSP exe-\ncutable that can be built using the EZ-KIT Lite tools is limited to \n8K words.\nThe EZ-KIT Lite includes the following features:\n• 75 MHz ADSP-2189M\n• Full 16-Bit Stereo Audi o I/O with AD73322 Codec\n• RS-232 Interface\n• EZ-ICE Connector for Emulator Control\n•D S P  D e m o n s t r a t i o n  P r o g r a m s\n• Evaluation Suite of VisualDSP++\nThe ADSP-218x EZ-ICE®‡ Emulator provides an easier and \nmore cost-effective method for engineers to develop and opti-\nmize DSP systems, shortening product development cycles for \nfaster time-to-market. ADSP-218xN series members integrate on-chip emulation support with a 14-pin ICE-Port interface. \nThis interface provides a simpler target board connection that \nrequires fewer mechanical clearance considerations than other ADSP-2100 Family EZ-ICEs. ADSP-218xN seri es members \nneed not be removed from the ta rget system when using the EZ-\nICE, nor are any adapters needed . Due to the small footprint of \nthe EZ-ICE connector, emulation can be supported in final \nboard designs.The EZ-ICE performs a full range of functions, \nincluding:\n• In-target operation\n• Up to 20 breakpoints\n• Single-step or full-speed operation\n• Registers and memory values  can be examined and altered\n• PC upload and download functions\n• Instruction-level emulation of program booting \nand execution• Complete assembly and di sassembly of instructions\n• C source-level debugging\nDesigning an EZ-ICE-Compatible System\nADSP-218xN series members have  on-chip emulation support \nand an ICE-Port, a special set of pins that interface to the EZ-\nICE. These features allow in-cir cuit emulation without replac-\ning the target system proce ssor by using only a 14-pin \nconnection from the target syst em to the EZ-ICE. Target sys-\ntems must have a 14-pin connector to accept the EZ-ICE’s in-\ncircuit probe, a 14-pin plug.\nNote:  The EZ-ICE uses the same V DD voltage as the V DD voltage \nused for V DDEXT . Because the input pins of the ADSP-218xN \nseries members are tolerant to input voltages up to 3.6 V, \nregardless of the value of V DDEXT , the voltage setting for the EZ-\nICE must not exceed 3.3 V.\nIssuing the chip reset command during emulation causes the \nDSP to perform a full chip reset, including a reset of its memory \nmode. Therefore, it is vital that  the mode pins are set correctly \nPRIOR to issuing a chip reset command from the emulator user \ninterface. If a passive method of maintaining mode information \nis being used (as discussed in Setting Memory Mode on Page 5 ), \nit does not matter that the mode  information is latched by an \nemulator reset. However, if the RESET  pin is being used as a \nmethod of setting the value of th e mode pins, the effects of an \nemulator reset must be taken into consideration.\nOne method of ensuring that th e values located on the mode \npins are those desired is to construct a circuit like the one shown in Figure 15 . This circuit forces the value located on the Mode A \npin to logic high, regardless of whether it is latched via the \nRESET  or ERESET  pin.\nThe ICE-Port interface consists  of the following ADSP-218xN \npins: EBR , EINT , EE, EBG , ECLK, ERESET , ELIN, EMS , and \nELOUT.\nThese ADSP-218xN pins must be connected only to the EZ-ICE \nconnector in the target system. These pins have no function \nexcept during emulation, and do not require pull-up or pull-\ndown resistors. The traces for these signals between the \nADSP-218xN and the conn ector must be kept as short as possi-\nble, no longer than 3 inches.\nThe following pins are also used by the EZ-ICE: BR , BG , RESET , \nand GND.†EZ-KIT Lite is a registered trademark of Analog Devices, Inc.\n‡EZ-ICE is a registered trademark of Analog Devices, Inc.Figure 15. Mode A Pi n/EZ-ICE CircuitPROGRAMMABLE I/OMODE A/PF0RESETERESET\nADSP-218xN\n1k/H9024\nADSP-218xN\nRev. A | Page 17  of 48 | August 2006The EZ-ICE uses the EE (emulator enable) signal to take control \nof the ADSP-218xN in the target system. This causes the proces-\nsor to use its ERESET , EBR , and EBG  pins instead of the RESET , \nBR, and BG  pins. The BG  output is three-stated. These signals \ndo not need to be jumper -isolated in the system.\nThe EZ-ICE connects to the target  system via a ribbon cable and \na 14-pin female plug. The female  plug is plugged onto the 14-\npin connector (a pin strip header) on the target board.\nTarget Board Connector for EZ-ICE Probe\nThe EZ-ICE connector (a standard  pin strip header) is shown in \nFigure 16 . This connector must be added to the target board \ndesign to use the EZ-ICE. Be sure to allow enough room in the \nsystem to fit the EZ-ICE prob e onto the 14-pin connector.\nThe 14-pin, 2-row pin strip header is keyed at the Pin 7 loca-\ntion—Pin 7 must be removed from  the header. The pins must \nbe 0.025 inch square and at least 0.20 inch in length. Pin spacing \nshould be 0.1 /H115470.1 inch. The pin strip header must have at least \n0.15 inch clearance on all sides to  accept the EZ-ICE probe plug.\nPin strip headers are availabl e from vendors such as 3M, \nMcKenzie, and Samtec.\nTarget Memory Interface\nFor the target system to be compatible with the EZ-ICE emula-\ntor, it must comply with the following memory interface \nguidelines:\nDesign the Program Memory (PM), Data Memory (DM), Byte \nMemory (BM), I/O Memory (I OM), and Composite Memory \n(CM) external interfaces to comply with worst-case device \ntiming requirements and switchin g characteristics as specified \nin this data sheet. The performance of the EZ-ICE may \napproach published worst-case specification for some memory \naccess timing requirements an d switching characteristics. \nNote:  If the target does not meet the worst-case chip specifica-\ntion for memory access parameters, the circuitry may not be \nable to be emulated at the desired CLKIN frequency. Depending \non the severity of the specificat ion violation, the system may be difficult to manufacture, as DSP components statistically vary in \nswitching characteristic and timing requirements, within pub-\nlished limits.\nRestriction:  All memory strobe si gnals on the ADSP-218xN \n(RD , WR , PMS , DMS , BMS , CMS , and IOMS ) used in the target \nsystem must have 10 k Ω pull-up resistors connected when the \nEZ-ICE is being used. The pu ll-up resistors are necessary \nbecause there are no internal pu ll-ups to guarantee their state \nduring prolonged three-state conditions resulting from typical \nEZ-ICE debugging sessions. Th ese resistors may be removed \nwhen the EZ-ICE is not being used.\nTarget System Interface Signals\nWhen the EZ-ICE board is installed, the performance on some \nsystem signals changes. Design th e system to be compatible with \nthe following system in terface signal changes introduced by the \nEZ-ICE board:\n• EZ-ICE emulation introduces an 8 ns propagation \ndelay between the target circuitry and the DSP on the \nRESET  signal.\n• EZ-ICE emulation introduces an 8 ns propagation \ndelay between the target circuitry and the DSP on the BR  \nsignal.\n•E Z - I C E  e m u l a t i o n  i g n o r e s  R E S E T  and BR , when \nsingle-stepping.\n•E Z - I C E  e m u l a t i o n  i g n o r e s  R E S E T  and BR  when in Emula-\ntor Space (DSP halted).\n• EZ-ICE emulation ignores the state of target BR  in certain \nmodes. As a result, the target  system may take control of \nthe DSP’s external memory bus only if bus grant (BG ) is \nasserted by the EZ-ICE board’s DSP.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThis data sheet provides a ge neral overview of ADSP-218xN \nseries functionality.

Table 10  and Table 11  list the active signals at specific \npins of the DSP during either of the two operating modes (Full \nMemory or Host). A signal in on e table shares a pin with a sig-\nnal from the other table, with the active signal determined by \nthe mode that is set. For the shared pins and their alternate sig-\nnals (e.g., A4/IAD3), refer to the package pinouts in Table 27 on \nPage 41  and Table 28 on Page 43 .\nTERMINATING UNUSED PINS\nTable 12  shows the recomm endations for terminating unused \npins.VDDINT 4I I n t e r n a l  V DD (1.8 V) Power (BGA)\nVDDEXT 7I E x t e r n a l  V DD (1.8 V, 2.5 V, or 3.3 V) Power (BGA)\nGND 20 I Ground (BGA)\nEZ-Port 9 I/O For Emulation Use\n1Interrupt/Flag pins retain both functions co ncurrently.

Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily \naccumulate on the human body and test equipment and can discharg e without detection. Although \nthe ADSP-218xN features proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may occur on devices subjected to high energy electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD precautions are \nrecommended to avoid performance de gradation or loss of functionality.\n\nRev. A | Page 24  of 48 | August 2006ADSP-218xN\nESD DIODE PROTECTION\nDuring the power-up sequence of the DSP, differences in the \nramp-up rates and activation time between the two supplies can cause current to flow in the I/O ESD protection circuitry. To \nprevent damage to the ESD diode protection circuitry, Analog \nDevices recommends includin g a bootstrap Schottky diode.\nThe bootstrap Schottky diode is  connected between the core \nand I/O power supplies, as shown in Figure 17 . It protects the \nADSP-218xN processor from partia lly powering the I/O supply. \nIncluding a Schottky diode will shorten the delay between the \nsupply ramps and thus prevent damage to the ESD diode pro-\ntection circuitry. With this techni que, if the core rail rises ahead \nof the I/O rail, the Schottky diode pulls the I/O rail along with \nthe core rail.POWER DISSIPATION\nTo determine total power dissipati on in a specific application, \nthe following equation should be applied for each output: C /H11547 \nVDD2 /H11547 f\nwhere:\nC = load capacitance.\nf = output switching frequency.\nExample:  In an application where external data memory is used \nand no other outputs are active, power dissipation is calculated \nas follows:\nAssumptions:\n• External data memory is acce ssed every cycle with 50% of \nthe address pins switching.\n• External data memory writes occur every other cycle with \n50% of the data pins switching.\n• Each address and data pin has a 10 pF total load at the pin.\n• Application operates at VDDEXT  = 3.3 V and t CK = 30 ns.\nTotal Power Di ssipation = P INT + (C /H11547VDDEXT2 /H11547 f)\nP INT = internal power dissipation from Figure 22 on Page 27 .\n(C /H11547 VDDEXT2 /H11547 f) is calculated for each output, as in the exam-\nple in Table 13 .Figure 17.

A | Page 25  of 48 | August 2006ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS\nTEST CONDITIONSOutput Disable Time\nOutput pins are considered to  be disabled when they have \nstopped driving and started a tran sition from the measured out-\nput high or low voltage to a hi gh impedance state. The output \ndisable time (t DIS) is the difference of t MEASURED  and t DECAY , as \nshown in Figure 20 . The time is the interval from when a refer-\nence signal reaches a high or low voltage level to when the output voltages have changed by  0.5 V from the measured out-\nput high or low voltage. \nThe decay time, t DECAY , is dependent on the capacitive load, C L, \nand the current load, i L, on the output pin. It can be approxi-\nmated by the following equation:\nfrom which\nis calculated. If multiple pins (s uch as the data bus) are disabled, \nthe measurement value is that of  the last pin to stop driving.\nOutput Enable Time\nOutput pins are considered to be  enabled when th ey have made \na transition from a high-impedance state to when they start \ndriving. The output enable time (t ENA) is the interval from when \na reference signal reaches a high or low voltage level to when the \noutput has reached a specified high or low trip point, as shown \nin Figure 20 . If multiple pins (such as the data bus) are enabled, \nthe measurement value is that of the first pin to start driving. Table 14.

Do not attempt to \nderive parameters from the addi tion or subtraction of others. \nWhile addition or subtraction would yield meaningful results \nfor an individual device, the va lues given in this data sheet \nreflect statistical variations and worst cases. Consequently, \nparameters cannot be added up meaningfully to derive \nlonger times.\nTiming Notes\nSwitching characteristics specif y how the processor changes its \nsignals. Designers have no cont rol over this timing—circuitry \nexternal to the processor must be designed for compatibility \nwith these signal characteristics. Switching characteristics tell \nwhat the processor will do in a given circumstance. Switching \ncharacteristics can also be used  to ensure that any timing \nrequirement of a device connected to the processor (such as \nmemory) is satisfied.\nTiming requirements apply to signals that are controlled by cir-\ncuitry external to the processor, such as the data input for a read \noperation. Timing requirements  guarantee that the processor \noperates correctly with other devices.\nFrequency Dependency For Timing Specifications\ntCK is defined as 0.5 t CKI. The ADSP-218xN uses an input clock \nwith a frequency equal to half th e instruction rate. For example, \na 40 MHz input clock (which is equivalent to 25 ns) yields a \n12.5 ns processor cycle (equivalent to 80 MHz). t CK values \nwithin the range of 0.5 t CKI period should be substituted for all \nrelevant timing parameters to obtain the specification value. \nExample: t CKH = 0.5 t CK – 2 ns = 0.5 (12.5 ns) – 2 ns = 4.25 ns\nOutput Drive Currents\nFigure 21  shows typical I-V characteri stics for the output driv-\ners on the ADSP-218xN series.The  curves represent the current \ndrive capability of the output drivers as a function of \noutput voltage.\nFigure 23  shows the typical powe r-down supply current.\nCapacitive Loading\nFigure 24  and Figure 25  show the capacitive  loading characteris-\ntics of the ADSP-218xN.Figure 21.
