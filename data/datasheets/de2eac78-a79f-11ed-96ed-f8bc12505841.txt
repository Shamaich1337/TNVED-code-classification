Total gain drift combinesthe mismatch of the external gain set resistor drift with that ofthe internal resistors (20 ppm/ ∞C typ).\nBandwidth of the SSM2019 is relatively independent of gain,\nas shown in Figure 2. For a voltage gain of 1000, the SSM2019\nhas a small-signal bandwidth of 200 kHz.

Bandwidth for Various Values of Gain\nNOISE PERFORMANCE\nThe SSM2019 is a very low noise audio preamplifier exhibiting\na typical voltage noise density of only 1 nV/ ÷Hz at 1 kHz. The\nexceptionally low noise characteristics of the SSM2019 are inpart achieved by operating the input transistors at high collectorcurrents since the voltage noise is inversely proportional to the\nsquare root of the collector current. Current noise, however, is\ndirectly proportional to the square root of the collector current.As a result, the outstanding voltage noise performance of the\nSSM2019 is obtained at the expense of current noise perform ance.\nAt low preamplifier gains, the effect of the SSM2019 voltage\nand current noise is insignificant.\nThe total noise of an audio preamplifier channel can be calculated by:\n    Eei Renn n St=+ +2 2 2()\nwhere:\nEn = total input referred noise\nen = amplifier voltage noise\nin = amplifier current noise\nRS = source resistance\net = source resistance thermal noise\nFor a microphone preamplifier, using a typical microphone\nimpedance of 150 W, the total input referred noise is:\n    En V H z p A H z n V H z\nnV Hz kHzn=+ ¥ + =() ( / ) ( . / )\n./ @12 150 1 6\n19 3 12 22W\nwhere:\nen = 1 nV/ ÷Hz @ 1 kHz, SSM2019 e n\nin = 2 pA/ ÷Hz @ 1 kHz, SSM2019 i n\nRS = 150 W, microphone source impedance\net = 1.6 nV /÷Hz @ 1 kHz, microphone thermal noise\nThis total noise is extremely low and makes the SSM2019\nvirtually transparent to the user.\nA\nREV.

Three Ways of Interfacing Transducers for\nHigh Noise ImmunityAlthough the SSM2019 inputs are fully floating, care must beexercised to ensure that both inputs have a dc bias connectioncapable of maintaining them within the input common-mode\nrange. The usual method of achieving this is to ground one side\nof the transducer as in Figure 3a. An alternative way is to floatthe transducer and use two resistors to set the bias point as in\nFigure 3b. The value of these resistors can be up to 10 k W, but\nthey should be kept as small as possible to limit common-mode\npickup. Noise contribution by resistors is negligible since it is\nattenuated by the transducer’s impedance. Balanced transducers\ngive the best noise immunity and interface directly as in Figure 3c.\nFor stability, it is required to put an RF bypass capacitor directly\nacross the inputs, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. This capacitor\nshould be placed as close as possible to the input terminals. Good\nRF practice should also be followed in layout and power supplybypassing, since the SSM2019 uses very high bandwidth devices.\nREFERENCE TERMINAL\nThe output signal is specified with respect to the reference terminal,\nwhich is normally connected to analog ground. The reference\nmay also be used for offset correction or level shifting. A refer-ence source resistance will reduce the common-mode rejection\nby the ratio of 5 k W/R\nREF. If the reference source resistance is\n1W, then the CMR will be reduced to 74 dB (5 k W/1 W = 74 dB).\nCOMMON-MODE REJECTION\nIdeally, a microphone preamplifier responds to only the difference\nbetween the two input signals and rejects common-mode voltages\nand noise. In practice, there is a small change in output voltage\nwhen both inputs experience the same common-mode voltagechange; the ratio of these voltages is called the common-modegain. Common-mode rejection (CMR) is the logarithm of the ratio\nof differential-mode gain to common-mode gain, expressed in dB.\nPHANTOM POWERING\nA typical phantom microphone powering circuit is shown inFigure 4. Z1 to Z4  provide transient overvoltage protection for\nthe SSM2019 whenever microphones are plugged in or unplugged.\nA\nREV. –8–PRINTED IN U.S.A.SSM2019\nBUS SUMMING AMPLIFIER\nIn addition to its use as a microphone preamplifier, the SSM2019\ncan be used as a very low noise summing amplifier. Such a circuit\nis particularly useful when many medium impedance outputs\nare summed together to produce a high effective noise gain.\nThe principle of the summing amplifier is to ground the SSM2019\ninputs. Under these conditions, Pins 1 and 8 are ac virtual grounds\nsitting about 0.55 V below ground. To remove the 0.55 V offset,\nthe circuit of Figure 5 is recomm ended.\nA2 forms a “servo” amplifier feeding the SSM2019 inputs. Thisplaces Pins l and 8 at a true dc virtual ground. R4 in conjunction\nwith C2 removes the voltage noise of A2, and in fact just about\nany operational amplifier will work well here since it is removedfrom the signal path. If the dc offset at Pins l and 8 is not toocritical, then the servo loop can be replaced by the diode biasing\nscheme of Figure 5. If ac coupling is used throughout, then Pins 2\nand 3 may be directly grounded.\n –/H9018 INVOUT SSM2019\nR4\n5.1k/H9024R3\n33k/H9024C1\n0.33/H9262FR2\n6.2k/H9024\nC2\n200/H9262F+/H9018 IN\nA2R510k/H9024V\nIN4148TO PINS\n2 AND 3\nFigure 5.
