A ferroelectric random access\nmemory or F-RAM is nonvolatile and performs reads and writes\nsimilar to a RAM. It provides reliable data retention for 151 y ears\nwhile eliminating the complexities, overhead, and system-level\nreliability problems caused by serial flash, EEPROM, and other\nnonvolatile memories. \nUnlike serial flash and EEPROM, the FM25V10 performs write\noperations at bus speed. No write delays are incurred. Data iswritten to the memory array immediately after each byte is\nsuccessfully transferred to the device. The next bus cycle can\ncommence without the need for data polling. In addition, theproduct offers substantial write endurance compared with other\nnonvolatile memories. The FM25V10 is capable of supporting\n10\n14 read/write cycles, or 100 million times more write cycles\nthan EEPROM. \nThese capabilities make the FM25V10 ideal for nonvolatile\nmemory applications, requirin g frequent or rapid writes.\nExamples range from data collection, where the number of write\ncycles may be critical, to demandi ng industrial controls where the\nlong write time of serial flash  or EEPROM can cause data loss. \nThe FM25V10 provides substantial benefits to users of serial\nEEPROM or flash as a hardware drop-in replacement. The\nFM25V10 uses the high-speed SPI bus, which enhances the\nhigh-speed write capability of F-RAM technology. TheFM25VN10 is offered with a unique serial number that is\nread-only and can be used to identify a board or system. Both\nthe devices incorporates a read-only Device ID that allows thehost to determine the manufacturer, product density, and produc t\nrevision. The device specific ations are guaranteed over an\nindustrial temperature range of –40 \uf0b0C to +85 \uf0b0C.\nFor a complete list of re lated documentation, click here.\nInstruction Decoder\nClock Generator\nControl Logic\nWrite Protect\nInstruction Register\nAddress Register  \nCounter128 K x 8       \nF-RAM Array\n 17\nData  I/   O Register8\nNonvolatile Status\nRegister3WP\nCS\nHOLD\nSCK\nSO SILogic Block Diagram\nDocument Number: 001-84499 Rev. *K Page 2 of 26FM25V10\nContents\nPinouts ....................................................... .......................3\nPin Definitions ............................................... ...................3\nFunctional Overview ........................................... .............4\nMemory Architecture ........................................... .............4\nSerial Peripheral Interface – SPI Bus ......................... .....4\nSPI Overview .................................................. .............4\nSPI Modes ..................................................... ..............5\nPower Up to First Access ...................................... ......6\nCommand Structure ............................................. .......6\nWREN - Set Write Enable Latch  .......... ........... ............ 6\nWRDI - Reset Write Enable Lat ch ............................... 6\nStatus Register and Write Protection .......................... ...7\nRDSR - Read Status Register ................................... ..8\nWRSR - Write Status Register  .................................. ..8\nMemory Operation .............................................. ..............8\nWrite Operation ............................................... ............8\nRead Operation ................................................ ...........9\nFast Read Operation ........................................... ........9\nHOLD Pin Operation ............................................ .....10\nSleep Mode .................................................... ...........11\nDevice ID ..................................................... ..............11\nUnique Serial Number (FM25V N10 only) ..................12\nFunction to Calculate CRC .. .............. ............ ......... ...13\nEndurance ..................................................... ............14Maximum Ratings ............................................... ............ 15\nOperating Range ............................................... .............. 15\nDC Electrical Characteristi cs ................................. ....... 15\nData Retention and Endurance .................................. ... 16\nCapacitance ................................................... ................. 16\nThermal Resistance ............................................ ............ 16\nAC Test Conditions ............................................ ............ 16\nAC Switching Characteristics .................................. ..... 17\nPower Cycle Timing ............................................ ........... 19\nOrdering Information .......................................... ............ 20\nOrdering Code Definitions ..................................... .... 20\nPackage Diagram s .......................................................... 21\nAcronyms ...................................................... .................. 23\nDocument Conventions .......................................... ....... 23\nUnits of Measure .............................................. ......... 23\nDocument History Page ......................................... ........ 24\nSales, Solutions, and Legal Information ...................... 2 6\nWorldwide Sales and Design S upport ......... .............. 26\nProducts ...................................................... .............. 26\nPSoC® Solutions ............................................... ....... 26\nCypress Developer Community . ................................ 26\nTechnical Support ........... .................................. ........ 26\nDocument Number: 001-84499 Rev. *K Page 3 of 26FM25V10\nPinouts\nFigure 1.  8-pin SOIC pinout\nFigure 2.  8-pin DFN pinoutHOLD\nSCK1\n2\n3\n4  5CS  8\n 7\n 6VDD\nSISO Top View\nnot to scale\nVSSWP\nSOCS\nVSSWP\nSIVDD\nSCKHOLD1\n2\n45678\n3O\nPADEXPOSED\nTop View\nnot to scale\nPin Definitions\nPin Name I/O Type Description\nCS Input Chip Select .

The memory array is\nlogically organized as 131,072 × 8 bits and is accessed using a n\nindustry-standard serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus. Thefunctional operation of the F-RAM is similar to serial flash an d\nserial EEPROMs. The major diff erence between the FM25V10\nand a serial flash or EEPROM with the same pinout is the\nF-RAM’s superior write perfor mance, high endurance, and low\npower consumption. \nMemory Architecture\nWhen accessing the FM25V10, the user addresses 64K\nlocations of eight data bits each. These eight data bits are sh ifted\nin or out serially. The addresses are accessed using the SPIprotocol, which includes a chip select (to permit multiple devi ces\non the bus), an opcode, and a three-byte address. The upper\n7 bits of the address range are 'don't care' values. The complet e\naddress of 17 bits specifies  each byte address uniquely. \nMost functions of the FM25V10  are either controlled by the SPI\ninterface or handled by on-board circuitry. The access time for\nthe memory operation is essentially zero, beyond the time\nneeded for the serial protocol. That is, the memory is read orwritten at the speed of the SPI bus. Unlike a serial flash or\nEEPROM, it is not necessary to poll the device for a ready\ncondition because writes occur at bus speed. By the time a newbus transaction can be shifted into the device, a write operati on\nis complete. This is explained in more detail in the interface\nsection. \nSerial Peripheral Interface – SPI Bus\nThe FM25V10 is a SPI slave device and operates at speeds upto 40 MHz. This high-speed serial bus provides\nhigh-performance serial communication to a SPI master. Many\ncommon microcontrollers have hardware SPI ports allowing adirect interface. It is quite simple to emulate the port using\nordinary port pins for microcontrollers that do not. The FM25V1 0\noperates in SPI Mode 0 and 3. \nSPI Overview\nThe SPI is a four-pin interface with Chip Select (CS ), Serial Input\n(SI), Serial Output (SO), a nd Serial Clock (SCK) pins. \nThe SPI is a synchronous serial interface, which uses clock and\ndata pins for memory access and supports multiple devices on\nthe data bus. A device on the SP I bus is activate d using the CS\npin. \nThe relationship between chip select, clock, and data is dictat ed\nby the SPI mode. This device supports SPI modes 0 and 3. Inboth of these modes, data is clocked into the F-RAM on the risi ng\nedge of SCK starting from the first rising edge after CS\n goes\nactive. \nThe SPI protocol is controlled by opcodes. These opcodes\nspecify the commands from the bus master to the slave device.\nAfter CS  i s  a c t i v a t e d ,  t h e  f i r s t  b yte transferred from the bus\nmaster is the opcode. Followin g the opcode, any addresses and\ndata are then transferred. The CS  must go inactive after anoperation is complete and before a new opcode can be issued.\nThe commonly used terms in the SPI protocol are as follows:\nSPI Master\nThe SPI master device controls the operations on a SPI bus. An\nSPI bus may have only one master with one or more slave\ndevices. All the slaves share the same SPI bus lines and the\nmaster may select any of the slave devices using the CS  pin. All\nof the operations must be initiated by the master activating a\nslave device by pulling the CS  pin of the slave LOW. The master\nalso generates the SCK and all the data transmission on SI and\nSO lines are synchroni zed with this clock. \nSPI Slave\nThe SPI slave device is activated  by the master through the Chi p\nSelect line. A slave device gets the SCK as an input from the S PI\nmaster and all the communicat ion is synchronized with this\nclock. An SPI slave never initiates a communication on the SPIbus and acts only on the inst ruction from the master.\nThe FM25V10 operates as an SPI slave and may share the SPI\nbus with other SPI slave devices. \nChip Select (CS\n)\nTo select any slave device, the master needs to pull down the\ncorresponding CS  pin. Any instruction can be issued to a slave\ndevice only while the CS  pin is LOW. When the device is not\nselected, data through the SI pin is ignored and the serial out put\npin (SO) remains in a high-impedance state.\nNote  A new instruction must begin with the falling edge of CS .\nTherefore, only one opcode can be issued for each active Chip\nSelect cycle.\nSerial Clock (SCK)\nThe Serial Clock is generated by the SPI master and the commu-\nnication is synchronized with this cl ock after CS  goes LOW.\nThe FM25V10 enables SPI modes 0 and 3 for data communi-\ncation. In both of these modes, the inputs are latched by the\nslave device on the rising edge of SCK and outputs are issuedon the falling edge. Therefore, the first rising edge of SCK\nsignifies the arrival of the first bit (MSB) of a SPI instructi on on\nthe SI pin. Further, all data in puts and outputs are synchroniz ed\nwith SCK.\nData Transmission (SI/SO)\nThe SPI data bus consists of two lines, SI and SO, for serial d ata\ncom munication.  SI is also referred to as M ast er  Out Slave I n\n(MOSI) and SO is referred to as Master In Slave Out (MISO). The\nmaster issues instructions to the slave through the SI pin, whi le\nthe slave responds through the SO pin. Multiple slave devices\nmay share the SI and SO lines as described earlier.\nThe FM25V10 has two separate pins for SI and SO, which can\nbe connected with the master as shown in Figure 3 on page 5 .\nFor a microcontroller that has no dedicated SPI bus, a\ngeneral-purpose port may be used. To reduce hardware\nresources on the controller, it is possible to connect the two data\npins (SI, SO) together and tie off (HIGH) the HOLD\n and WP  pins.\nFigure 4 on page 5  shows such a configuration, which uses only\nthree pins.\nDocument Number: 001-84499 Rev. *K Page 5 of 26FM25V10\nMost Significant Bit (MSB)\nThe SPI protocol requires that the first bit to be transmitted is the\nMost Significant Bit (MSB). This is valid for both address and\ndata transmission. \nThe 1-Mbit serial F-RAM require s a 3-byte address for any read\nor write operation. Because the address is only 17 bits, the fi rst\nseven bits, which are fed in are ignored by the device. Althoug h\nthese seven bits are ‘don’t care’, Cypress recommends thatthese bits be set to 0s to enable seamless transition to higher\nmemory densities.Serial Opcode\nAfter the slave device  is selected with CS\n going LOW, the first\nbyte received is treated as the opcode for the intended operati on.\nFM25V10 uses the standard opcodes for memory accesses.\nInvalid Opcode\nIf an invalid opcode is received, the opcode is ignored and the\ndevice ignores any additional serial data on the SI pin until t he\nnext falling edge of CS , and the SO pin remains tristated.\nStatus Register\nFM25V10 has an 8-bit Status Register. The bits in the Status\nRegister are used to configure the device. These bits are\ndescribed in Table 3 on page 7 .\nSPI Modes\nFM25V10 may be driven by a microcontroller with its SPI\nperipheral running in either  of the following two modes:\n■SPI Mode 0 (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0)\n■SPI Mode 3 (CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1)\nFor both these modes, the input data is latched in on the risin g\nedge of SCK starting from the first rising edge after CS  goes\nactive. If the clock starts from a HIGH state (in mode 3), the firstrising edge after the clock toggl es is considered. The output d ata\nis available on the fa lling edge of SCK. \nThe two SPI modes are shown in Figure 5 on page 6  and \nFigure 6 on page 6 . The status of the clock when the bus master\nis not transferring data is:\n■SCK remains at 0 for Mode 0 \n■SCK remains at 1 for Mode 3 Figure 3.

If the\nSCK pin is LOW when the device is selected, SPI Mode 0 isassumed and if the SCK pin is HIGH, it works in SPI Mode 3.\nPower Up to First Access\nThe FM25V10 is not accessible for a tPU time after power-up.\nUsers must comply with the timing parameter, tPU, which is the\nminimum time from VDD (min) to the first CS  LOW. \nCommand Structure\nThere are ten commands, called opcodes, that can be issued by\nthe bus master to the FM25 V10. They are listed in Table 1 .\nThese opcodes control the func tions performed by the memory.WREN - Set Write Enable Latch\nThe FM25V10 will power up with writes disabled. The WREN\ncommand must be issued before any write operation. Sending\nthe WREN opcode allows the user to issue subsequent opcodesfor write operations. These incl ude writing the Status Register\n(WRSR) and writing the memory (WRITE). \nSending the WREN opcode causes the internal Write Enable\nLatch to be set. A flag bit in the Status Register, called WEL,\nindicates the state of the latch.  WEL = ‘1’ indicates that writ es are\npermitted. Attempting to write the WEL bit in the Status Regist er\nhas no effect on the state of this bit – only the WREN opcode c an\nset this bit. The WEL bit will be automatically cleared on the rising\nedge of CS\n following a WRDI, a WRSR, or a WRITE operation.\nThis prevents further writes to the Status Register or the F-RA M\narray without another WREN command. Figure 7  illustrates the\nWREN command bus configuration.\nWRDI - Reset Write Enable Latch\nThe WRDI command disables all write activity by clearing theWrite Enable Latch. T he user can verify that  writes are disable d\nby reading the WEL bit in the Status Register and verifying tha t\nWEL is equal to ‘0’. Figure 8  illustrates the WRDI command bus\nconfiguration.Figure 5.  SPI Mode 0\nFigure 6.  SPI Mode 3\nTable 1.

The Status Registe ris organized as follows. (The default value shipped from the\nfactory for bit 0, WEL, BP0, BP1, bits 4–5, WPEN is ‘0’, and fo r\nbit 6 is ‘1’).\nBits 0 and 4–5 are fixed at ‘0’ and bit 6 is fixed at ‘1’; none  of these\nbits can be modified. Note that bit 0 (“Ready or Write in progr ess”\nbit in serial flash and EEPROM) is unnecessary, as the F-RAM\nwrites in real-time and is never busy, so it reads out as a ‘0’ . An\nexception to this is when the device is waking up from sleep\nmode, which is described in Sleep Mode on page 11 . The BP1\nand BP0 control the software write-protection features and arenonvolatile bits. The WEL flag indicates the state of the Write\nEnable Latch. Attempting to directly write the WEL bit in the\nStatus Register has no effect on its state. This bit is interna lly set\nand cleared via the WREN and WRDI commands, respectively. \nBP1 and BP0 are memory block write protection bits. They\nspecify portions of m emory that are write-protected as shown in\nTable 4 .The BP1 and BP0 bits and the Write Enable Latch are the only\nmechanisms that protect the memory from writes. The remaining\nwrite protection features prot ect inadvertent c hanges to the bl ock\nprotect bits. \nThe write protect enable bit (WPEN) in the Status Register\ncontrols the effect of the hardware write protect (WP\n) pin. When\nthe WPEN bit is set to ‘0’, the status of the WP  pin is ignored.\nWhen the WPEN bit is set to ‘1’, a LOW on the WP  pin inhibits a\nwrite to the Status Register. Thus the Status Register iswrite-protected only when WPEN = ‘1’ and WP\n = ‘0’. \nTable 5  summarizes the write protection conditions.Table 2.

Reading the status register\nprovides information about the current state of thewrite-protection features. Fo llowing the RDSR opcode, the\nFM25V10 will return one byte with the contents of the Status\nRegister. WRSR - Write Status Register\nThe WRSR command allows the SPI bus master to write into theStatus Register and change the write protect configuration by\nsetting the WPEN, BP0 and BP1 bits as required. Before issuinga WRSR command, the WP\n pin must be HIGH or inactive. Note\nthat on the FM25V10, WP  only prevents writing to the Status\nRegister, not the memory array. Before sending the WRSR\ncommand, the user must send a WREN command to enablewrites. Executing a WRSR command is a write operation and\ntherefore, clears th e Write Enable Latch.\nMemory Operation\nThe SPI interface, which is capable of a high clock frequency,\nhighlights the fast write capability of the F-RAM technology.Unlike serial flash and EEPROM s, the FM25V10 can perform\nsequential writes at bus speed. No page register is needed and\nany number of sequential writes may be performed. \nWrite Operation\nAll writes to the memory begin with a WREN opcode with CS\nbeing asserted and deasserted. The next opcode is WRITE. The\nWRITE opcode is followed by a three-byte address containing\nthe 17-bit address (A16–A0) of the first data byte to be writte n\ninto the memory. Subsequent bytes are data bytes, which are\nwritten sequentially. Addresses are incremented internally as\nlong as the bus master continues  to issue clocks and keeps CSLOW. If the last address of 1FF FFh is reached, the counter will\nroll over to 00000h. Da ta is written MSB first. The rising edge  of\nCS terminates a write operation. A  write operation is shown in \nFigure 11 on page 9 .\nNote  When a burst write reaches a protected block address, the\nautomatic address increment st ops and all the subsequent data\nbytes received for write wi ll be ignored by the device.\nEEPROMs use page buffers to inc rease their write throughput.\nThis compensates for the technology’s inherently slow writeoperations. F-RAM memories do not have page buffers because\neach byte is written to the F-RAM array immediately after it is\nclocked in (after the eighth clock).

Following the READ command is a three-byte address\ncontaining the 17-bit address (A16–A0) of the first byte of theread operation. After the opcode and address are issued, thedevice drives out the read data  on the next eight clocks. The S I\ninput is ignored during read dat a bytes. Subsequent bytes are\ndata bytes, which are read out sequentially. Addresses are incr e-\nmented internally as long as the bus master continues to issue\nclocks and CS\n is LOW. If the last addre ss of 1FFFFh is reached,\nthe counter will roll over to 0000 0h. Data is read MSB first. T he\nrising edge of CS  terminates a read operation and tristates the\nSO pin. A read operation is shown in  Figure 12 .\nFast Read Operation\nThe FM25V10 supports a FAST READ opcode (0Bh) that is\nprovided for code compatibility with serial flash devices. TheFAST READ opcode is followed by a three-byte address\ncontaining the 17-bit address (A16-A0) of the first byte of the\nread operation and then a dummy byte. The dummy byte insertsa read latency of 8-clock cycle. The fast read operation is\notherwise the same as an ordinary read operation except that it\nrequires an additional dummy byte. After receiving opcode,address, and a dummy byte, the FM25V10 starts driving its SOline with data bytes, with MSB fi rst, and continues transmittin g\nas long as the device is selected and the clock is available. I n\ncase of bulk read, the internal address counter is incrementedautomatically, and after the last address 1FFFFh is reached, th e\ncounter rolls over to 00000h. When the device is driving data o n\nits SO line, any transition on its SI line is ignored. The risi ng edge\nof CS\n terminates a fast read operat ion and tristates the SO pin.\nA Fast Read operation is shown in Figure 13 on page 10 .\nFigure 11.

If the bus master pulls the HOLD  pin LOW while SCK\nis LOW, the current operation will pause. Taking the HOLD  pinHIGH while SCK is LOW will resume an operation. The\ntransitions of HOLD  must occur while SCK is LOW, but the SCK\nand CS  pin can toggle dur ing a hold state.Figure 13.

The device will enter the low-power state when the\nSLEEP opcode B9h is clocked i n and a rising edge of CS  is\napplied. When in sleep mode, the SCK and SI pins are ignoredand SO will be HI-Z, but the de vice continues to monitor the CSpin. On the next falling edge of CS , the device will return to\nnormal operation within tREC time. The SO pin remains in a HI-Z\nstate during the wakeup period.  The device does not necessarily\nrespond to an opcode within the wakeup period. To start the\nwakeup procedure, the controller may send a “dummy” read, for\nexample, and wait the remaining tREC time.\nDevice ID\nThe FM25V10 device can be interrogated for its manufacturer,\nproduct identification, and die revision. The RDID opcode 9Fh\nallows the user to read the manufacturer ID and product ID, bot h\nof which are read-only bytes. The JEDEC-assigned manufacturer ID places the Cypress\n(Ramtron) identifier in bank 7; therefore, there are six bytes of\nthe continuation code 7Fh followed by the single byte C2h. Ther e\nare two bytes of product ID, which includes a family code, a\ndensity code, a sub code, and  the product revision code.Figure 15.

It can be used to uniquely identify a pc board or syste m.\nThe serial number includes a 40-bit unique number, an 8-bitCRC, and a 16-bit number that can be defined upon request bythe customer. If a customer-specific number is not requested, t he\n16-bit Customer Identifier is 0x0000.\nThe serial number is read by i ssuing the SNR op-code (C3h).The 8-bit CRC value can be used to compare to the value\ncalculated by the controller. If the two values match, then the\ncommunication between slave and master was performedwithout errors. The function (shown below) is used to calculate\nthe CRC value. To perform the calculation, 7 bytes of data are\nfilled into a memory buffer in the same order as they are readfrom the part – i.e. byte 7, byte 6, byte 5, byte 4, byte 3, by te 2,\nbyte 1 of the serial number. The calculation is performed on th e\n7 bytes, and the result should match the final byte out from th e\npart which is byte 0 , the 8-bit CRC value.\nNote  Contact factory for requesting a customer identifier number.Table 7.  8-Byte Seria l Number (Read only)\nCustomer Identifier 40-bit Unique number 8-bit CRC\nSN (63:56) SN (55:48) SN (47:40) SN  (39:32) SN (31:24) SN (23:16) SN (15:8) SN (7:0)\nDocument Number: 001-84499 Rev. *K Page 13 of 26FM25V10\nFunction to Calculate CRC\nBYTE calcCRC8( BYTE* pData, int nBytes )\n{static BYTE crct able [256] = {\n};\nBYTE crc = 0;\nwhile( nBytes-- ) crc = cr ctable[crc ^ *pData++];\nreturn crc;}0x00, 0x07, 0x0E, 0x09, 0x1C, 0x1B, 0x12, 0x15,\n0x38, 0x3F, 0x36, 0x31, 0x24, 0x23, 0x2A, 0x2D,\n0x70, 0x77, 0x7E, 0x79, 0x6C, 0x6B, 0x62, 0x65,0x48, 0x4F, 0x46, 0x41, 0x54, 0x53, 0x5A, 0x5D,\n0xE0, 0xE7, 0xEE, 0xE9, 0xFC, 0xFB, 0xF2, 0xF5,\n0xD8, 0xDF, 0xD6, 0xD1, 0xC4, 0xC3, 0xCA, 0xCD,0x90, 0x97, 0x9E, 0x99, 0x8C, 0x8B, 0x82, 0x85,\n0xA8, 0xAF, 0xA6, 0xA1, 0xB4, 0xB3, 0xBA, 0xBD,\n0xC7, 0xC0, 0xC9, 0xCE, 0xDB, 0xDC, 0xD5, 0xD2,0xFF, 0xF8, 0xF1, 0xF6, 0xE3, 0xE4, 0xED, 0xEA,\n0xB7, 0xB0, 0xB9, 0xBE, 0xAB, 0xAC, 0xA5, 0xA2,\n0x8F, 0x88, 0x81, 0x86, 0x93, 0x94, 0x9D, 0x9A,0x27, 0x20, 0x29, 0x2E, 0x3B, 0x3C, 0x35, 0x32,\n0x1F, 0x18, 0x11, 0x16, 0x03, 0x04, 0x0D, 0x0A,\n0x57, 0x50, 0x59, 0x5E, 0x4B, 0x4C, 0x45, 0x42,0x6F, 0x68, 0x61, 0x66, 0x73, 0x74, 0x7D, 0x7A,\n0x89, 0x8E, 0x87, 0x80, 0x95, 0x92, 0x9B, 0x9C,\n0xB1, 0xB6, 0xBF, 0xB8, 0xAD, 0xAA, 0xA3, 0xA4,0xF9, 0xFE, 0xF7, 0xF0, 0xE5, 0xE2, 0xEB, 0xEC,\n0xC1, 0xC6, 0xCF, 0xC8, 0xDD, 0xDA, 0xD3, 0xD4,\n0x69, 0x6E, 0x67, 0x60, 0x75, 0x72, 0x7B, 0x7C,0x51, 0x56, 0x5F, 0x58, 0x4D, 0x4A, 0x43, 0x44,\n0x19, 0x1E, 0x17, 0x10, 0x05, 0x02, 0x0B, 0x0C,\n0x21, 0x26, 0x2F, 0x28, 0x3D, 0x3A, 0x33, 0x34,0x4E, 0x49, 0x40, 0x47, 0x52, 0x55, 0x5C, 0x5B,\n0x76, 0x71, 0x78, 0x7F, 0x6A, 0x6D, 0x64, 0x63,\n0x3E, 0x39, 0x30, 0x37, 0x22, 0x25, 0x2C, 0x2B,0x06, 0x01, 0x08, 0x0F, 0x1A, 0x1D, 0x14, 0x13,\n0xAE, 0xA9, 0xA0, 0xA7, 0xB2, 0xB5, 0xBC, 0xBB,\n0x96, 0x91, 0x98, 0x9F, 0x8A, 0x8D, 0x84, 0x83,0xDE, 0xD9, 0xD0, 0xD7, 0xC2, 0xC5, 0xCC, 0xCB,\n0xE6, 0xE1, 0xE8, 0xEF, 0xFA, 0xFD, 0xF4, 0xF3\nDocument Number: 001-84499 Rev. *K Page 14 of 26FM25V10\nEndurance\nThe FM25V10 devices are capable of being accessed at least\n1014 times, reads or writes. An F -RAM memory operates with a\nread and restore mechanism. Therefore, an endurance cycle isapplied on a row basis for each access (read or write) to thememory array. The F-RAM architecture is based on an array of\nrows and columns of 16K rows of 64-bits each. The entire row is\ninternally accessed once, whether  a single byte or all eight by tes\nare read or written. Each byte in the row is counted only once in\nan endurance calculation. Table 7  shows endurance calculations\nfor a 64-byte repeating loop, which includes an opcode, a start ing\naddress, and a sequential 64-byte data stream. This causes\neach byte to experience one endurance cycle through the loop.\nF-RAM read and write endurance  is virtually unlimited even at a\n40-MHz clock rate.Table 8.
