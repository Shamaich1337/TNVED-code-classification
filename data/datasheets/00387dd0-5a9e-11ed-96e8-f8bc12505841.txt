The AD5040/AD5060 parts offer a relative accuracy specification  of ±1 LSB and operation are guaranteed monotonic with a  ±1 LSB DNL specification. The parts use a versatile 3-wire serial \ninterface that operates at clock rates up to 30 MHz and is \ncompatible with standard SPI®, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™, and DSP interface standards. The reference for both the AD5040 and AD5060 is supplied from an external V\nREF pin. A reference \nbuffer is also provided on-chip. The AD5060 incorporates a \npower-on reset circuit that ensures the DAC output powers up \nto midscale or zero scale and remains there until a valid write takes place to the device. The AD5040 and the AD5060 both contain a power-down feature that reduces the current con-sumption of the device to typically 330 nA at 5 V and provides \nsoftware-selectable output loads while in power-down mode. \nThe parts are put into power-down mode over the serial interface. Total unadjusted error for the parts is <2 mV .  \nBoth parts exhibit very low glitch on power-up.

A | Page 14 of 24 TERMINOLOGY \nRelative Accuracy \nFor the DAC, relative accuracy or integral nonlinearity (INL) is \na measure of the maximum deviation, in LSBs, from a straight line passing through the endpoints of the DAC transfer function. A typical AD5060 INL vs. code plot is shown in \nFigure 4 . \nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL) \nDifferential nonlinearity is the difference between the measured \nchange and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent \ncodes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB maximum \nensures monotonicity. This DAC is guaranteed monotonic by \ndesign. A typical AD5060 DNL vs. code plot is shown in Figure 5 . \nOffset Error  \nOffset error is a measure of the output error when zero code \n(0x0000) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally, the output should be 0 V . The zero-code error is always positive in the AD5040/AD5060 because the output of the DAC cannot go below 0 V . This is due to a combination of the offset errors in \nthe DAC and output amplifier. Zero-code error is expressed  \nin mV . \nFull-Scale Error  \nFull-scale error is a measure of the output error when full-scale \ncode (0xFFFF AD5060, 0x3FFF AD5040) is loaded to the DAC \nregister. Ideally, the output should be V\nDD − 1 LSB. Full-scale \nerror is expressed in percent of full-scale range. \nGain Error \nThis is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the devia-\ntion in slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from ideal, \nexpressed as a percent of the full-scale range. Tota l Una djuste d Error (TUE)  \nTotal unadjusted error is a measure of the output error taking \nall the various errors into account. A typical AD5060 TUE vs. \ncode plot is shown in Figure 6 . \nOffset Error Drift  \nThis is a measure of the change in zero-code error with a \nchange in temperature. It is expressed in μV/°C. \nGain Error Drift \nThis is a measure of the change in gain error with changes in \ntemperature. It is expressed in (ppm of full-scale range)/°C. \nDigital-to-Analog Glitch Impulse \nDigital-to-analog glitch impulse is the impulse injected into the \nanalog output when the input code in the DAC register changes state. It is normally specified as the area of the glitch in nV-s and is measured when the digital input code is changed by 1 LSB at the worst case code 53786; see Figure 23  and Figure 24 . \nThe expanded view in Figure 23  shows the glitch generated \nfollowing completion of the calibration routine; Figure 24  \nzooms in on this glitch. \nDigital Feedthrough  \nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into \nthe analog output of the DAC from the digital inputs of the DAC, but is measured when the DAC output is not updated. It is specified in nV-s and measured with a full-scale code change \non the data bus—that is, from all 0s to all 1s, and vice versa. \n \n \n AD5040/AD5060\n \nRev. A | Page 15 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD5040/AD5060 are single 14-/16-bit, serial input, voltage \noutput DACs. The parts operate from supply voltages of 2.7 V \nto 5.5 V . Data is written to the AD5060 in a 24-bit word format, \nand to the AD5040 in a 16-bit word format, via a 3-wire serial interface. \nBoth the AD5040 and AD5060 incorporate a power-on reset \ncircuit that ensures the DAC output powers up to a known out-\nput state (midscale or zero-scale, see the Ordering Guide ). The \ndevices also have a software power-down mode that reduces the \ntypical current consumption to less than 1 μa. \nDAC ARCHITECTURE \nThe DAC architecture of the AD5060 consists of two matched DAC sections. A simplified circuit diagram is shown in  \nFigure 40 . The 4 MSBs of the 16-bit data-word are decoded to \ndrive 15 switches, E1 to E15. Each of these switches connects  \n1 of 15 matched resistors to either DACGND or the V\nREF buffer \noutput.  The remaining 12 bits of the data-word drive switches \nS0 to S11 of a 12-bit voltage mode R-2R ladder network. \n2R\n04767-027S0\nVREF2R\nS12R\nS112R\nE12R\nE22R\nE152RVOUT\n12-BIT R-2R LADDER FOUR MSBs DECODED INTO\n15 EQUAL SEGMENTS \n \nFigure 40. AD5060 DAC Ladder Structure \nREFERENCE BUFFER \nThe AD5040 andAD5060 operate with an external reference. \nThe reference input (V REF) has an input range of 2 V to  \nVDD − 50 mV . This input voltage is then used to provide a \nbuffered reference for the DAC core.  SERIAL INTERFACE \nThe AD5060/AD5040 have a 3-wire serial interface ( SYNC , \nSCLK, and DIN), which is compatible with SPI, QSPI, and \nMICROWIRE interface standards, as well as most DSPs.  \n shows a timing diagram of a typical AD5060 write \nsequence. Figure 2\nThe write sequence begins by bringing the SYNC  line low. For \nthe AD5060, data from the DIN line is clocked into the 24-bit \nshift register on the falling edge of SCLK. The serial clock \nfrequency can be as high as 30 MHz, making these parts compatible with high speed DSPs. On the 24th falling clock edge, the last data bit is clocked in and the programmed function is executed (that is, a change in the DAC output or a change in the mode of operation). \nAt this stage, the SYNC\n line can be kept low or be brought \nhigh. In either case, it must be brought high for a minimum of \n12 ns before the next write sequence so that a falling edge of \nSYNC  can initiate the next write sequence. Because the SYNC  \nbuffer draws more current when V IH = 1.8 V than it does when \nVIH = 0.8 V , SYNC  should be idled low between write sequences \nfor an even lower power operation of the part. As previously indicated, however, it must be brought high again just before the next write sequence. The AD5040 requires 16 clock periods \nto update the input shift register. On the 16th falling clock edge, \nthe last data bit is clocked in and the programmed function is executed (that is, a change in the DAC output or a change in the \nmode of operation). \nInput Shift Register \nThe AD5060 input shift register is 24 bits wide; see Figure 41 . \nPD1 and PD0 are control bits that control the operating mode \nof the part—normal mode or any one of three power-down modes (see the Power-Down Modes  section for more detail). \nThe next 16 bits are the data bits. These are transferred to the \nDAC register on the 24th falling edge of SCLK. \n \nDATA BITSDB15 (MSB) DB0 (LSB)\nD15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nNORMAL OPERATION\n1kΩ TO GND100kΩ TO GND3-STATE\nPOWER-DOWN MODES0\n0\n110\n1\n01\n04767-0280 0 0 0 0 0 PD1 PD0\n \n \nFigure 41.

The \nnext 14 bits are the data bits. These are transferred to the DAC \nregister on the 16th falling edge of SCLK. \nSYNC  Interrupt \nIn a normal write sequence for the AD5060, the SYNC  line is \nkept low for at least 24 falling edges of SCLK, and the DAC is updated on the 24th falling edge. However, if SYNC\n is brought \nhigh before the 24th falling edge, the write sequence is \ninterrupted. The shift register is reset and the write sequence is considered invalid. Neither an update of the DAC register \ncontents nor a change in the operating mode occurs; see \n. In a normal write sequence for the AD5040, the Figure \n43 SYNC\n line \nis kept low for at least 16 falling edges of SCLK, and the DAC is \nupdated on the 16th falling edge. However, if SYNC  is brought \nhigh before the 16th falling edge, the write sequence is \ninterrupted. The shift register is reset and the write sequence is \nconsidered invalid. Neither an update of the DAC register \ncontents nor a change in the operating mode occurs.  POWER-ON RESET \nThe AD5040 and AD5060 both contain a power-on reset  \ncircuit that controls the output voltage during power-up. The \nDAC register is filled with the zero-scale code or midscale code and the output voltage is set to zero scale or midscale (see the \nOrdering Guide  for more details on the reset model). It remains \nthere until a valid write sequence is made to the DAC. This is \nuseful in applications where it is important to know the output \nstate of the DAC while it is in the process of powering up. \nSOFTWARE RESET \nThe AD5060 device can be put into software reset by setting all \nbits in the DAC register to 1; this includes writing 1s to Bit D23 \nand Bit D16, which is not the normal mode of operation. For the AD5040 this includes writing 1s to Bit D15 and Bit D14, \nwhich is also not the normal mode of operation. Note that the \nSYNC\n interrupt command cannot be performed if a software \nreset command is started in the AD5040 or AD5060.  \n \n04767-074DATA BITSDB13 (MSB) DB0 (LSB)\nD13 PD0 PD1 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nNORMAL OPERATION\n100kΩ TO GND3-STATEPOWER-DOWN MODES0\n0\n10\n1\n0\n \nFigure 42.

A | Page 17 of 24 POWER-DOWN MODES \nThe AD5060 features four operating modes, and the AD5040 \nfeatures three operating modes. These modes are software pro-\ngrammable by setting two bits in the control register (Bit DB17 and Bit DB16 in the AD5060 and Bit DB15 and Bit DB14 in the \nAD5040). Table 6  and Table 7  show how the state of the bits \ncorresponds to the operating mode of the two devices. \nTable 6.

However, for the three power-down modes of the \nAD5060 and the two power down modes of the AD5040, the supply current falls to less than 1μA at 5 V (65 nA at 3 V). Not only does the supply current fall, but the output stage is also internally switched from the output of the amplifier to a resistor network of known values. This is advantageous because the \noutput impedance of the part is known while the part is in \npower-down mode. The output is connected internally to GND through a 1 kΩ resistor (AD5060 only) or a 100 kΩ resistor, or it is left open-circuited (three-stated). The output stage is \nillustrated in Figure 44 . \nPOWER-DOWN\nCIRCUITRYAD5040/\nAD5060\nDAC\n04767-029VOUT\nRESISTOR\nNETWORKOUTPUT\nBUFFER\n \n \nFigure 44.

However, the contents of the DAC register are unaffected when in power-down. The time to exit power-down \nis typically 2.5 μs for V\nDD = 5 V , and 5 μs for V DD = 3 V; \nsee Figure 29 .

The ADSP-2101/ADSP-2103 \nshould be set up to operate in the SPORT transmit alternate framing mode. The ADSP-2101/ADSP-2103 sport is pro-grammed through the SPORT control register and should be \nconfigured for internal clock operation, active low framing, and \n16-bit word length. Transmission is initiated by writing a word \nto the Tx register after the SPORT has been enabled. \nAD5040/\nAD5060 1\n1ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYTFS\nDT\nSCLKSYNC\nDINSCLK\n04767-030ADSP-2101/\nADSP-21031\n \n \nFigure 45.

SCK of the \n68HC11/68L11 drives the SCLK pin of the AD5040/AD5060, while the MOSI output drives the serial data line of the DAC. \nThe SYNC\n signal is derived from a port line (PC7). The setup \nconditions for correct operation of this interface require that the \n68HC11/68L11 be configured so that its CPOL bit is 0 and its \nCPHA bit is 1. When data is being transmitted to the DAC, the \nSYNC  line is taken low (PC7). When the 68HC11/68L11 is \nconfigured where its CPOL bit is 0 and its CPHA bit is 1, data \nappearing on the MOSI output is valid on the falling edge of SCK. Serial data from the 68HC11/68L11 is transmitted in 8-bit bytes with only 8 falling clock edges occurring in the transmit cycle. Data is transmitted MSB first. In order to load data to the \nAD5040/AD5060, PC7 is left low after the first eight bits are \ntransferred, and a second serial write operation is performed to \nthe DAC. PC7 is taken high at the end of this procedure. \nAD5040/\nAD50601\n1ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYPC7\nSCK\nMOSISYNC\nSCLK\nDIN\n04767-03268HC11/\n68L111\n \n \nFigure 46.

Using SPORT0 to connect to the AD5040/AD5060, the setup for the interface is: DT0PRI drives the SDIN pin of the AD5040/AD5060, while TSCLK0 drives the SCLK of the part; the SYNC\n is driven from TFS0.

The setup  \nfor the interface is: TxD of the 80C51/80L51 drives SCLK of  \nthe AD5040/AD5060 while RxD drives the serial data line  \nof the part. The SYNC  signal is again derived from a bit-\nprogrammable pin on the port. In this case, Port Line P3.3 is \nused. When data is to be transmitted to the AD5040, P3.3 is taken low. The 80C51/80L51 transmits data only in 8-bit bytes; thus only 8 falling clock edges occur in the transmit cycle. To load data to the DAC, P3.3 is left low after the first eight bits are transmitted, and a second write cycle is initiated to transmit the \nsecond byte of data. P3.3 is taken high following the completion \nof this cycle. The 80C51/80L51 outputs the serial data in a \nformat which has the LSB first. The AD5040/AD5060 require \ndata to be received with the MSB as the first bit. The \n80C51/80L51 transmit routine should take this into account. \n80C51/80L511\n1ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYP3.3\nTxD\nRxDSYNC\nSCLK\nDIN\n04767-034AD5040/\nAD50601\n \n \nFigure 48.

A | Page 19 of 24 APPLICATIONS \nCHOOSING A REFERENCE FOR THE AD5040/ \nAD5060 \nTo achieve the optimum performance from the AD5040/ \nAD5060, carefully choose a precision voltage reference. The \nAD5040/AD5060 have just one reference input, V REF. The \nvoltage on the reference input is used to supply the positive input to the DAC. Therefore, any error in the reference is \nreflected in the DAC. \nThere are four possible sources of error to consider when \nchoosing a voltage reference for high accuracy applications: \ninitial accuracy, ppm drift, long-term drift, and output voltage noise. Initial accuracy on the output voltage of the DAC leads  to a full-scale error in the DAC. To minimize these errors, a reference with high initial accuracy is preferred. Also, choosing \na reference with an output trim adjustment, such as an ADR43x \ndevice, allows a system designer to trim out system errors by setting a reference voltage to a voltage other than the nominal. The trim adjustment can also be used at temperature to trim \nout any errors. \nBecause the supply current required by the AD5040/AD5060 is \nextremely low, the parts are ideal for low supply applications. \nThe ADR395 voltage reference is recommended. This requires less than 100 μA of quiescent current and can, therefore, drive \nmultiple DACs in one system, if required. It also provides very \ngood noise performance at 8 μV p-p in the 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz range. \nSYNC\nSCLK\nDIN7V\n5V\nVOUT = 0V TO 5VADR395\n04767-0363-WIRE\nSERIAL\nINTERFACEAD5040/\nAD5060\n \n \nFigure 50. ADR395 as Reference to AD5060/AD5040 \nLong-term drift is a measure of how much the reference drifts \nover time. A reference with a tight long-term drift specification \nensures that the overall solution remains relatively stable during its entire lifetime. The temperature coefficient of a reference output voltage affects INL, DNL, and TUE. A reference with a tight temperature coefficient specification should be chosen to reduce the temperature dependence of the DAC output voltage on ambient conditions. \nIn high accuracy applications, which have a relatively low noise \nbudget, reference output voltage noise needs to be considered. It \nis important to choose a reference with as low an output noise \nvoltage as practical for the system noise resolution required. Precision voltage references, such as the ADR435, produce low output noise in the 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz region.

A | Page 20 of 24 USING THE AD5040/AD5060 WITH A \nGALVANICALLY ISOLATED INTERFACE CHIP \nIn process control applications in industrial environments, it is \noften necessary to use a galvanically isolated interface to protect \nand isolate the controlling circuitry from any hazardous \ncommon-mode voltages that can occur in the area where the \nDAC is functioning. iCoupler® provides isolation in excess of \n2.5 kV . Because the AD5040/AD5060 use a 3-wire serial logic \ninterface, the ADuM130x family provides an ideal digital \nsolution for the DAC interface. \nThe ADuM130x isolators provide three independent isolation \nchannels in a variety of channel configurations and data rates. \nThey operate across the full range from 2.7 V to 5.5 V , providing \ncompatibility with lower voltage systems as well as enabling a \nvoltage translation functionality across the isolation barrier. \nFigure 52  shows a typical galvanically isolated configuration \nusing the AD5040/AD5060. The power supply to the part  \nalso needs to be isolated; this is accomplished by using a \ntransformer. On the DAC side of the transformer, a 5 V \nregulator provides the 5 V supply required for the \nAD5040/AD5060. \n0.1μF 10μF\nVDD\nGNDPOWER5V\nREGULATOR\n04767-038ADuM1300SCLK V0A V1A SCLK\nVOUT SYNC V0B V1B SDI\nDIN V0C V1C DATAAD5040/\nAD5060\n \n \nFigure 52. AD5040/AD5060 with a Galvanically Isolated Interface  \nPOWER SUPPLY BYPASSING AND GROUNDING \nWhen accuracy is important in a circuit, it is helpful to carefully \nconsider the power supply and ground return layout on the \nboard. The printed circuit board containing the AD5040/ \nAD5060 should have separate analog and digital sections, each \nhaving its own area of the board. If the AD5040/AD5060 are in a system where other devices require an AGND-to-DGND \nconnection, the connection should be made at one point only. \nThis ground point should be as close as possible to the AD5040/AD5060. \nThe power supply to the AD5040/AD5060 should be bypassed \nwith 10 μF and 0.1 μF capacitors. The capacitors should be \nphysically as close as possible to the device with the 0.1 μF \ncapacitor ideally right up against the device. The 10 μF \ncapacitors are the tantalum bead type. It is important that the 0.1 μF capacitor has low effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESI), as do common ceramic types \nof capacitors. This 0.1 μF capacitor provides a low impedance \npath to ground for high frequencies caused by transient \ncurrents due to internal logic switching. \nThe power supply line itself should have as large a trace as \npossible to provide a low impedance path and reduce glitch \neffects on the supply line. Clocks and other fast switching \ndigital signals should be shielded from other parts of the board by a digital ground. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals, if possible. When traces cross on opposite sides of the board, ensure that they run at right angles to each other to \nreduce feedthrough effects on the board. The best board layout \ntechnique is the microstrip technique where the component side of the board is dedicated to the ground plane only, and the signal traces are placed on the solder side. However, this is not \nalways possible with a two-layer board. \n  \n \n AD5040/AD5060\n \nRev.
