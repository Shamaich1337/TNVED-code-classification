It requires only two resistors to set an output \ncurrent between 0.5mA and 200mA. A multitude of analog \ntechniques lend themselves to actively programming the \noutput current. The LT3092 is stable without input and \noutput capacitors, offering high DC and AC impedance. This \nfeature allows operation in intrinsically safe applications. \nThe SET pin features 1% initial accuracy and low tem -\nperature coefficient. Current regulation is better than  \n10ppm/V from 1.5V to 40V.\nThe LT3092 can operate in a 2-terminal current source \nconfiguration in series with signal lines. It is ideal for driv -\ning sensors, remote supplies, and as a precision current \nlimiter for local supplies.\nInternal protection circuitry includes reverse-battery and \nreverse-current protection, current limiting and thermal \nlimiting.

D For more information www.analog.comIntroduction\nThe LT3092 is a versatile IC that operates as a 2-terminal \nprogrammable current source with the addition of only \ntwo external resistors; no external bypass capacitors are \nneeded for stability.\nThe LT3092 is easy to use and has all the protection fea -\ntures expected in high performance products. Included \nare reverse-voltage protection, reverse-current protec -\ntion, short-circuit protection and thermal shutdown with \nhysteresis. \nThe LT3092 operates with or without input and output \ncapacitors. The simplest current source application \nrequires only two discrete resistors to set a constant  \noutput current up to 200mA. A variety of analog tech-\nniques lend themselves to regulating and varying the cur -\nrent source value.\nThe device utilizes a precision “0” TC 10μA reference cur -\nrent source to program output current. This 10µA cur -\nrent source connects to the noninverting input of a power \noperational amplifier . The power operational amplifier pro -\nvides a low impedance buffered output of the voltage on \nthe noninverting input. \nMany application areas exist in which operation without \ninput and output capacitors is advantageous. A few of \nthese applications include sensitive circuits that cannot \nendure surge currents under fault or overload conditions \nand intrinsic safety applications in which safety regula -\ntions limit energy storage devices that may spark or arc.\nProgramming Output Current in 2 -Terminal  \nCurrent Source Mode \nSetting the LT3092 to operate as a 2-terminal current \nsource is a simple matter . The 10µA  reference current \nfrom the SET pin is used with one resistor to generate \na small voltage, usually in the range of 100mV to 1V \n(200mV is a level that will help reject offset voltage, line \nregulation, and other errors without being excessively \nlarge). This voltage is then applied across a second resis -\ntor that connects from OUT to the first resistor . Figure\xa01 \nshows connections and formulas to calculate a basic cur -\nrent source configuration. APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nWith a 10μA current source generating the reference \nthat gains up to set output current, leakage paths to or \nfrom the SET pin can create errors in the reference and \noutput currents. High quality insulation should be used \n(e.g., Teflon, Kel-F). The cleaning of all insulating surfaces \nto remove fluxes and other residues may be required. \nSurface coating may be necessary to provide a moisture \nbarrier in high humidity environments.\nMinimize board leakage by encircling the SET pin and \ncircuitry with a guard ring operated at a potential close \nto itself;  tie the guard ring to the OUT pin. Guarding  \nboth sides of the circuit board is required. Bulk leakage \nreduction depends on the guard ring width. Ten nanoam -\nperes of leakage into or out of the SET pin and its asso -\nciated circuitry creates a 0.1% reference current error . \nLeakages of this magnitude, coupled with other sources \nof leakage, can cause significant offset voltage and refer -\nence current drift, especially over the possible operating \ntemperature range.\nFigure\xa01.

The question now arises: the \nratio of these resistors is known, but what value should \neach resistor be?\nThe first resistor to select is R SET. The value selected \nshould generate enough voltage to minimize the error \ncaused by the offset between the SET and OUT pins. A \nreasonable starting level is 200mV of voltage across R SET \n(RSET equal to 20k). Resultant errors due to offset volt -\nage are a few percent. The lower the voltage across R SET \nbecomes, the higher the error term due to the offset.\nLT3092\n10\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nand inductive components and may be complex distrib -\nuted networks. In addition, the current source’s value will \ndiffer between applications and its connection may be \nGND referenced, power supply referenced or floating in \na signal line path. Analog Devices strongly recommends \nthat stability be tested in situ for any LT3092 application.\nIn LT3092  applications with long wires or PCB traces, the \ninductive reactance may cause instability. In some cases, \nadding series resistance to the input and output lines (as \nshown in Figure\xa02) may sufficiently dampen these pos -\nsible high-Q lines and provide stability. The user must \nevaluate the required resistor values against the design’s \nheadroom constraints. In general, operation at low out -\nput current levels (< 5mA) automatically requires higher \nvalues of programming resistors and may provide the \nnecessary damping without additional series impedance.\nIf the line impedances in series with the LT3092 are com -\nplex enough such that series damping resistors are not \nsufficient, a frequency compensation network may be \nnecessary. Several options may be considered. From this point, selecting R OUT is easy, as it is a straight -\nforward calculation from R SET. Take note, however , resis -\ntor errors must be accounted for as well. While larger \nvoltage drops across R SET minimize the error due to off -\nset, they also increase the required operating headroom.\nObtaining the best temperature coefficient does not \nrequire the use of expensive resistors with low ppm tem -\nperature coefficients. Instead, since the output current of \nthe LT3092 is determined by the ratio of R SET to R OUT, \nthose resistors should have matching temperature char -\nacteristics. Less expensive resistors made from the same \nmaterial will provide matching temperature coefficients. \nSee resistor manufacturers’ data sheets for more details.\nStability and Frequency Compensation\nThe LT3092 does not require input or output capacitors \nfor stability in many current-source applications. Clean, \ntight PCB layouts provide a low reactance, well controlled \noperating environment for the LT3092 without requiring \ncapacitors to frequency-compensate the circuit. The front \npage Typical Application circuit illustrates the simplicity \nof using the LT3092.\nSome current source applications will use a capacitor \nconnected in parallel with the SET pin resistor to lower \nthe current source’s noise. This capacitor also provides a \nsoft-start function for the current source. This capacitor \nconnection is depicted in Figure\xa07 (see the Quieting the \nNoise section). \nWhen operating with a capacitor across the SET pin resis -\ntor , external compensation is usually required to maintain \nstability and compensate for the introduced pole. The fol -\nlowing paragraphs discuss methods for stabilizing the \nLT3092 for either this capacitance or other complex \nimpedances that may be presented to the device. Analog \nDevices strongly recommends testing stability in situ with \nfinal components before beginning production.\nAlthough the LT3092 ’s design strives to be stable without \nany capacitors over a wide variety of operating conditions, \nit is not possible to test for all possible combinations of \ninput and output impedances that the LT3092 will encoun -\nter . These impedances may include resistive, capacitive Figure\xa02.

D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure\xa03 depicts the simplest frequency compensation \nnetwork as a single capacitor connected across the two \nterminals of the current source. In this case, either a \ncapacitor with a value less than 1000pF, or greater than \n1µF (ESR <  0.5Ω ), may stabilize the circuit. Some applica -\ntions may use the small value capacitor to stand off DC \nvoltage, but allow the transfer of data down a signal line.\nFor some applications, this capacitance range may be \nunacceptable or present a design constraint. One circuit \nexample typifying this is an “intrinsically-safe” circuit in \nwhich an overload or fault condition potentially allows \nthe capacitor’ s stored energy to create a spark or arc.  \nFor applications in which a single capacitor is unaccept -\nable, Figure\xa03 alternately shows a series RC network con -\nnected across the two terminals of the current source. \nThis network has two benefits. First, it limits the potential \ndischarge current of the capacitor under a fault condi -\ntion, preventing sparks or arcs. Second, it bridges the gap \nbetween the upper bound of 1000pF for small capacitors \nto the lower bound of 1µF for large capacitors such that \nalmost any value capacitor can be used. This allows the \nuser greater flexibility for frequency compensating the \nloop and fine tuning the RC network for complex imped -\nance networks. In many instances, a series RC network \nis the best solution for stabilizing the application circuit. \nTypical resistor values will range from 100Ω to about 5k, \nespecially for capacitor values in between 1000pF and \n1µF. Once again, Analog Devices strongly recommends \nFigure\xa04. Input and/or Output Capacitors May \nBe Used for Compensationtesting stability in situ for any LT3092 application across \nall operating conditions, especially ones that present \ncomplex impedance networks at the input and output of \nthe current source.\nIf an application refers the bottom of the LT3092 current \nsource to GND, it may be necessary to bypass the top \nof the current source with a capacitor to GND. In some \ncases, this capacitor may already exist and no additional \ncapacitance is required. For example, if the LT3092 was \nused as a variable current source on the output of a power \nsupply, the output bypass capacitance would suffice to \nprovide LT3092 stability. Other applications may require \nthe addition of a bypass capacitor . Once again, the same \ncapacitor value requirements previously mentioned apply \nin that an upper bound of 1000pF exists for small values \nof capacitance, and a lower bound of 1µF (ESR < 0.5Ω) \nexists for large value capacitors. A series RC network may \nalso be used as necessary, and depends on the applica -\ntion requirements. \nIn some extreme cases, capacitors or series RC networks \nmay be required on both the LT3092’ s input and output to \nstabilize the circuit. Figure\xa04 depicts a general application \nusing input and output capacitor networks, rather than \nan input-to-output capacitor . As the input of the current \nsource tends to be high impedance, placing a capacitor \non the input does not have the same effect as placing a \ncapacitor on the lower impedance output, and the same \n3092 F04IN\nSET OUT+\n–L T3092\n10µA\nIOUTRSET ROUT\nCOUT ORVIN\nCOUTROUTCINRIN\nFigure\xa03.

D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nrestrictions do not apply. Capacitors in the range of 0.1µF \nto 1µF usually provide sufficient bypassing on the input, \nand the value of input capacitance may be increased with -\nout limit. \nIf an application uses GND referred capacitors on the \ninput or output (particularly the input), pay attention to \nthe length of the lines powering and returning ground \nfrom the circuit. In the case where long power supply and \nreturn lines are coupled with low ESR input capacitors, \napplication-specific voltage spikes, oscillations and reli -\nability concerns may be seen. This is not an issue with \nLT3092 stability, but rather the low ESR capacitor form -\ning a high-Q resonant tank circuit with the inductance of \nthe input wires. Adding series resistance with the input \nof the LT3092, or with the input capacitor , often solves \nthis. Resistor values of 0.1Ω to 1Ω are often sufficient to \ndampen this resonance.\nGive extra consideration to the use of ceramic capacitors. \nCeramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of \ndielectrics, each with different behavior across tempera -\nture and applied voltage. The most common dielectrics \nused are specified with EIA temperature characteristic \ncodes of Z5U, Y5V , X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V \ndielectrics are good for providing high capacitances in a small package, but they tend to have strong voltage \nand temperature coefficients as shown in Figure\xa05 and \nFigure\xa06. When used with a 5V regulator , a 16V 10μF Y5V \ncapacitor can exhibit an effective value as low as 1μF to \n2μF for the DC bias voltage applied and over the operating \ntemperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in \nmore stable characteristics and are more suitable for use \nas the output capacitor . The X7R type has better stability \nacross temperature, while the X5R is less expensive and \nis available in higher values. Care still must be exercised \nwhen using X5R and X7R capacitors; the X5R and X7R \ncodes only specify operating temperature range and maxi -\nmum capacitance change over temperature. Capacitance \nchange due to DC bias with X5R and X7R capacitors is \nbetter than Y5V and Z5U capacitors, but can still be sig -\nnificant enough to drop capacitor values below appro -\npriate levels. Capacitor DC bias characteristics tend to \nimprove as component case size increases, but expected \ncapacitance at operating voltage should be verified.\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress. In a \nceramic capacitor the stress can be induced by vibrations \nin the system or thermal transients.\nDC BIAS VOL TAGE (V)CHANGE IN VALUE (%)\n3092 F0520\n0\n–20\n–40\n–60\n–80\n–100\n0 4 8 10 2 6 12 14X5R\nY5V\n16BOTH CAPACITORS ARE 16V,\n1210 CASE SIZE, 10µF  \nFigure\xa05.

D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nQuieting the Noise\nWhen a reduction in the noise of the current source is \ndesired, a small capacitor can be placed across R SET \n(CSET in Figure\xa07). Normally, the 10µA reference cur -\nrent source generates noise current levels of 2.7pA/√ Hz \n(0.7nA RMS over the 10Hz  to 100kHz  bandwidth). The SET \npin resistor generates a spot noise equal to i n = √4kT/R (k \n= Boltzmann’s constant, 1.38 • 10–23J/°K, and T is abso -\nlute temperature) which is RMS-summed with the noise \ngenerated by the 10µA reference current source. Placing \na CSET capacitor across R SET (as shown in Figure\xa07) \nbypasses this noise current. Note that this noise reduction \ncapacitor increases start-up time as a factor of the time \nconstant formed by R SET • CSET. When using a capacitor \nacross the SET pin resistor , the external pole introduced \nusually requires compensation to maintain stability. See \nthe Stability and Frequency Compensation section for \ndetailed descriptions on compensating LT3092 circuits.\nA curve in the Typical Performance Characteristics section \ndepicts noise spectral density for the reference current \nover a 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth.Paralleling Devices\nObtain higher output current by paralleling multiple \nLT3092’ s together . The simplest application is to run two \ncurrent sources side by side and tie their inputs together \nand their outputs together , as shown in Figure\xa08 . This \nallows the sum of the current sources to deliver more out -\nput current than a single device is capable of delivering. \nAnother method of paralleling devices requires fewer \ncomponents and helps to share power between devices. \nTie the individual SET pins together and tie the individual \nIN pins together . Connect the outputs in common using \nsmall pieces of PC trace as ballast resistors to promote \nequal current sharing. PC trace resistance in milliohms/\ninch is shown in Table\xa01. Ballasting requires only a tiny \narea on the PCB.\nTable\xa01. PC Board T race Resistance\nWEIGHT (oz) 10mil WIDTH 20mil WIDTH\n1 54.3 27.1\n2 27.1 13.6\nT race resistance is measured in mΩ/in\nThe worst-case room temperature offset, only ±2mV be-\ntween the SET pin and the OUT pin, allows the use of very \nsmall ballast resistors. \nAs shown in Figure\xa09, each LT3092 has a small 40mΩ \nballast resistor , which at full output current gives better \nthan 80% equalized sharing of the current. The external \nresistance of 40mΩ (20mΩ for the two devices in paral -\nlel) only adds about 8mV of output voltage compliance at \nan output of 0.4A. Of course, paralleling more than two \nLT3092’ s yields even higher output current. Spreading the \ndevice on the PC board also spreads the heat. Series input \nresistors can further spread the heat if the input-to-output \ndifference is high.\nThermal Considerations\nThe LT3092’ s internal power and thermal limiting circuitry \nprotects itself under overload conditions. For continuous \nnormal load conditions, do not exceed the 125°C maxi -\nmum junction temperature. Carefully consider all sources \nof thermal resistance from junction-to-ambient. This \nincludes (but is not limited to) junction-to-case, case-\nto-heat sink interface, heat sink resistance or circuit Figure\xa07.

Consider \nall additional, adjacent heat generating sources in proxim -\nity on the PCB.\nSurface mount packages provide the necessary heat \nsinking by using the heat spreading capabilities of the \nPC board, copper traces and planes. Surface mount heat \nsinks, plated through-holes and solder filled vias can also \nspread the heat generated by power devices.\nJunction-to-case thermal resistance is specified from the \nIC junction to the bottom of the case directly, or the bot -\ntom of the pin most directly, in the heat path. This is the \nlowest thermal resistance path for heat flow. Only proper \ndevice mounting ensures the best possible thermal flow \nfrom this area of the package to the heat sinking material. Note that the Exposed Pad of the DFN package and the \nTab of the SOT-223 package are electrically connected \nto the output (V OUT).\nThe following tables list thermal resistance as a function \nof copper areas in a fixed board size. All measurements \nwere taken in still air on a four-layer FR-4 board with 1oz \nsolid internal planes and 2oz external trace planes with a \ntotal finished board thickness of 1.6mm.\nPCB layers, copper weight, board layout and thermal vias \naffect the resultant thermal resistance.

The thermal shutdown circuit’ s typical \ntemperature threshold is 165° C and has about 5 °C of \nhysteresis.\nThe LT3092’ s IN pin withstands ±40V voltages with \nrespect to the SET and OUT pins. Reverse-current flow, \nif OUT is greater than IN, is less than 1mA (typically under \n100µA), protecting the LT3092 and sensitive loads. \nClamping diodes and 1k limiting resistors protect the \nLT3092’s SET pin relative to the OUT pin voltage. These \nprotection components typically only carry current under \ntransient overload conditions. These devices are sized to \nhandle ±10V differential voltages and ±15mA crosspin \ncurrent flow without concern. APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT3092\n16\nRev.
