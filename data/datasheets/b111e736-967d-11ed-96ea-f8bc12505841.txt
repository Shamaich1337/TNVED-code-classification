The performance of chip multilayer ceramic capacitors (henceforth just "capacitors") may be affected by the\n    storage conditions. Please use them promptly after delivery.\n1-1. Maintain appropriate storage for the capacitors using the following conditions:\n         Room Temperature of +5 ℃ to +40℃ and a Relative Humidity of 20% to 70%.\n\u3000        High temperature and humidity conditions and/or prolonged storage may cause deterioration of the packaging\n        materials. If more than six months have elapsed since delivery, check packaging, mounting, etc. before use.\n        In addition, this may cause oxidation of the electrodes. If more than one year has elapsed since delivery, \n       also check the solderability before use.\n 1-2. Corrosive gas can react with the termination (external) electrodes or lead wires of capacitors, and result\n          in poor solderability. Do not store the capacitors in an atmosphere consisting of corrosive gas (e.g.,hydrogen  \n         sulfide, sulfur dioxide, chlorine, ammonia gas etc.).\n 1-3. Due to moisture condensation caused by rapid humidity changes, or the photochemical change caused \n         by direct sunlight on the terminal electrodes and/or the resin/epoxy coatings, the solderability and \n         electrical performance may deteriorate. Do not store capacitors under direct sunlight or in high huimidity \n         conditions!\nJEMCGC-03007C 7\n■Rating\n1.Temperature Dependent Characteristics\n1. The electrical characteristics of the capacitor can change with temperature.\n 1-1. For capacitors having larger temperature dependency, the capacitance may change with temperature \n         changes. The following actions are recommended in order to ensure suitable capacitance values.\n    (1) Select a suitable capacitance for the operating temperature range.\n    (2) The capacitance may change within the rated temperature.\n          When you use a high dielectric constant type capacitor in a circuit that needs a tight (narrow) capacitance \n          tolerance (e.g., a time-constant circuit), please carefully consider the temperature characteristics, and \n          carefully confirm the various characteristics in actual use conditions and the actual system.\n2.Measurement of Capacitance\n1. Measure capacitance with the voltage and frequency specified in the product specifications.\n 1-1. The output voltage of the measuring equipment may decrease occasionally when capacitance is high.\n         Please confirm whether a prescribed measured voltage is impressed to the capacitor.\n 1-2. The capacitance values of high dielectric constant type capacitors change depending on the AC voltage applied.\n         Please consider the AC voltage characteristics when selecting a capacitor to be used in a AC circuit.\n3.Applied Voltage\n1. Do not apply a voltage to the capacitor that exceeds the rated voltage as called out in the specifications.\n 1-1. Applied voltage between the terminals of a capacitor shall be less than or equal to the rated voltage.\n    (1) When AC voltage is superimposed on DC voltage, the zero-to-peak voltage shall not exceed the rated DC voltage.\n          When AC voltage or pulse voltage is applied, the peak-to-peak voltage shall not exceed the rated DC voltage.\n    (2) Abnormal voltages (surge voltage, static electricity, pulse voltage, etc.) shall not exceed the rated DC voltage.\n               \nTypical Voltage Applied to the DC capacitor\nDC Voltage DC Voltage+AC AC Voltage Pulse Voltage\n(E：Maximum possible applied voltage.)\n 1-2. Influence of over voltage\n         Over voltage that is applied to the capacitor may result in an electrical short circuit caused by the breakdown \n         of the internal dielectric layers .\n         The time duration until breakdown depends on the applied voltage and the ambient temperature.\n2. Use a safety standard certified capacitor in a power supply input circuit (AC filter), as it is also necessary to \n    consider the withstand voltage and impulse withstand voltage defined for each device.Caution!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n E E E E \n0 0 0 \n0 \nJEMCGC-03007C 8\n4.Type of Applied Voltage and Self-heating Temperature\n1.Confirm the operating conditions to make sure that no large current is flowing into the capacitor due to the\n    continuous application of an AC voltage or pulse voltage.\n    When a DC rated voltage product is used in an AC voltage circuit or a pulse voltage circuit, the AC current\n    or pulse current will flow into the capacitor; therefore check the self-heating condition.\n    Please confirm the surface temperature of the capacitor so that the temperature remains within the upper limits\n    of the operating temperature, including the rise in temperature due to self-heating. When the capacitor is\n    used with a high-frequency voltage or pulse voltage, heat may be generated by dielectric loss.\n<Applicable to Temperature Characteristic X7R(R7), X7T(D7)>\n  1-1. The load should be contained so that the self-heating of the capacitor body remains below 20°C, \n          when  measuring at an ambient temperature of 25°C. In addition, use a K thermocouple of  ø0.1mm with less \n         heat capacity when measuring, and measure in a condition where there is no effect from the radiant \n         heat of other components or air flow caused by convection. Excessive generation of heat may cause \n         deterioration of the characteristics and reliability of the capacitor. (Absolutely do not perform\n         measurements while the cooling fan is operating, as an accurate measurement may not be performed.)\n5. DC Voltage and AC Voltage Characteristic\n1. The capacitance value of a high dielectric constant type capacitor changes depending on the DC voltage applied.\n    Please consider the DC voltage characteristics when a capacitor is selected for use in a DC circuit. \n    \n 1-1. The capacitance of ceramic capacitors may change sharply  depending on the applied voltage. (See figure)\n         Please confirm the following in order to secure the capacitance.\n   (1) Determine whether the capacitance change caused by the applied voltage is within the allowed range . \n   (2) In the DC voltage characteristics, the rate of capacitance change becomes larger as voltageincreases, \n         even if the applied voltage is below the rated voltage. When a high dielectric constant type capacitor is used in \n         a circuit that requires a tight (narrow) capacitance tolerance (e.g., a time constant circuit), please carefully consider \n        the voltage characteristics, and confirm  the various characteristics in the actual operating conditions of the system. \n        \n2. The capacitance values of high dielectric constant type capacitors changes depending on the AC voltage applied. \n    Please consider the AC voltage characteristics when selecting a capacitor to be used in an AC circuit.\n6. Capacitance Aging\n1. The high dielectric constant type capacitors have an Aging characteristic in which the capacitance  value decreases \n    with the passage of time.\n    When you use a high dielectric constant type capacitors in a circuit that needs a tight (narrow) capacitance tolerance\n    (e.g., a time-constant circuit), please carefully consider the characteristics of these capacitors, such as their aging, voltage, \n    and temperature characteristics. In addition, check capacitors using your actual appliances at the intended environment \n    and operating conditions.\n     \n7.Vibration and Shock\n1.  Please confirm the kind of vibration and/or shock, its condition, and any generation of resonance.\n     Please mount the capacitor so as not to generate resonance, and do not allow any impact on the terminals.\n \n2.

When sudden heat is applied to the components, the [Standard Conditions for Reflow Soldering]\n   mechanical strength of the components will decrease\n   because a sudden temperature change causes\n   deformation inside the components. In order to prevent\n   mechanical damage to the components, preheating is\n   required for both the components and the PCB.\n   Preheating conditions are shown in table 1. It is required to\n   keep the temperature differential between the solder and\n   the components surface (ΔT) as small as possible.\n2. When components are immersed in solvent after mounting,\n   be sure to maintain the temperature difference (ΔT)\n   between the component and the solvent within the range\n   shown in the table 1.\n              [Allowable Reflow Soldering Temperature and Time]\nTable 1\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 In the case of repeated soldering, the accumulated\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 soldering time must be within the range shown above.\nRecommended Conditions\nPb-Sn Solder : Sn-37Pb\nLead Free Solder : Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu\n3. When a capacitor is mounted at a temperature lower than the peak reflow temperature recommended by the\n    solder manufacturer, the following quality problems can occur. Consider factors such as the placement of\n    peripheral components and the reflow temperature setting to prevent the capacitor’s reflow temperature from\n    dropping below the peak temperature specified. Be sure to evaluate the mounting situation beforehand and\n    verify that none of the following problems occur.\n  ･Drop in solder wettability\n  ･Solder voids\n  ･Possible occurrence of whiskering\n  ･Drop in bonding strength\n  ･Drop in self-alignment properties\n  ･Possible occurrence of tombstones and/or shifting on the land patterns of the circuit board\n4.

When sudden heat is applied to the components, the\n   mechanical strength of the components will decrease\n   because a sudden temperature change causes\n   deformation inside the components. In order to prevent\n   mechanical damage to the components, preheating is\n   required for both of the components and the PCB.\n   Preheating conditions are shown in table 2.

Capacitors also tend to be affected by mechanical and thermal stress depending \n    on the board preheating temperature or the soldering fillet shape, and can be the cause of cracks. \n    Please refer to "1. PCB Design" or "3. Optimum solder amount" for the solder amount and the fillet shapes.\n1. Correction with a Soldering Iron\n  1-1. In order to reduce damage to the capacitor, be sure to preheat the capacitor and the mounting board.\n          Preheat to the temperature range shown in Table 3. A hot plate, hot air type preheater, etc. can be used for preheating.\n  1-2. After soldering, do not allow the component/PCB to cool down rapidly.\n  1-3. Perform the corrections with a soldering iron as quickly as possible. If the soldering iron is applied too long,\n          there is a possibility of causing solder leaching on the terminal electrodes, which will cause deterioration of the\n          adhesive strength and other problems.\nTable 3\n*Applicable for both Pb-Sn and Lead Free Solder.\n  Pb-Sn Solder : Sn-37Pb\n  Lead Free Solder : Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu\n*Please manage Δ T in the temperature of soldering iron and the preheating temperature. \n2. Correction with Spot Heater\n    Compared to local heating with a soldering iron, hot air heating by a spot heater heats the overall component\n    and board, therefore, it tends to lessen the thermal shock. In the case of a high density mounted board, \n    a spot heater can also prevent concerns of the soldering iron making direct contact with the component.\n 2-1. If the distance from the hot air outlet of the spot heater to the component is too close, cracks may occur due to\n         thermal shock. To prevent this problem, follow the conditions shown in Table 4.\n 2-2. In order to create an appropriate solder fillet shape, it is recommended that hot air be applied at the angle shown\n         in Figure 1.\nTable 4\nDistance 5mm or more\nHot Air Application angle 45° *Figure 1\nHot Air Temperature Nozzle Outlet 400°C max.\nLess than 10 seconds\nApplication Time (3216M / 1206 size or smaller)\nLess than 30 seconds\n(3225M / 1210 size or larger) (3216M , 3225M : Metric size code)\n3.

Assembly\n1. Handling\n     If a board mounted with capacitors is held with one hand, the board may bend.\n     Firmly hold the edges of the board with both hands when handling.\n     If a board mounted with capacitors is dropped, cracks may occur in the capacitors.\n     Do not use dropped boards, as there is a possibility that the quality of the capacitors may be impaired.\n2. Attachment of Other Components\n 2-1. Mounting of Other Components\n         Pay attention to the following items, when mounting other components on the back side of the board after \n         capacitors have been mounted on the opposite side.\n         When the bottom dead point of the suction nozzle is set too low, board deflection stress may be applied \n         to the capacitors on the back side (bottom side), and cracks may occur  in the capacitors.\n        · After the board is straightened, set the bottom dead point of the nozzle on the upper surface of the board.\n        · Periodically check and adjust the bottom dead point.\n 2-2. Inserting Components with Leads into Boards\n         When inserting components (transformers, IC, etc.) into boards, bending the board may cause cracks in the\n         capacitors or cracks in the solder. Pay attention to the following.\n        · Increase the size of the holes to insert the leads, to reduce the stress on the board during insertion.\n        · Fix the board with support pins or a dedicated jig before insertion.\n        · Support below the board so that the board does not bend. When using support pins on the board, \n           periodically confirm that there is no difference in the height of each support pin.\n 2-3. Attaching/Removing Sockets and/or Connectors\n         Insertion and removal of sockets and connectors, \n etc., might cause the board to bend. \n         Please insure \n that the board does not warp during insertion and \n removal of sockets and connectors, etc., \n\u3000\u3000  \u3000 or the \n bending may damage mounted components on the \n board.\n 2-4. Tightening Screws\n         The board may be bent, when tightening screws, etc. during the attachment of the board to a shield or\n         chassis. Pay attention to the following items before performing the work.\n        · Plan the work to prevent the board from bending.\n        · Use a torque screwdriver, to prevent over-tightening of the screws.\n        · The board may bend after mounting by reflow soldering, etc. Please note, as stress may be applied \n           to the chips by forcibly flattening the board when tightening the screws.Caution!\nSuction  Nozzle\nComponent with Leads\nSocket\nScrewdriver[Outline Drawing ] Router\nJEMCGC-03007C 17\n■ Others\n1.

Notice for Pattern Forms\n 1-1. Unlike leaded components, chip components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted\n         directly on the substrate.\n         They are also more sensitive to mechanical and thermal stresses than leaded components.\n         Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. \n         When designing substrates, take land patterns and dimensions into consideration to eliminate the possibility \n         of excess solder fillet height.\n 1-2. There is a possibility of chip cracking caused by PCB expansion/contraction with heat, because stress\n        \n        \n       \n          on a chip is different depending on PCB material and structure.When the thermal expansion coefficient\n          greatly differs between the board used for mounting and the chip,it will cause cracking of the chip due to\n          the thermal expansion and contraction. When capacitors are mounted on a fluorine resin printed circuit \n         board or on a single-layered glass epoxy board, it may also cause cracking of the chip for the same reason.\nPattern Forms\nin section in section\nin section in section\nin section in sectionPlacing of Leaded \nComponents\nafter Chip Component\nLateral MountingNotice\nProhibited Correct\nPlacing Close to Chassis\nPlacing of Chip \nComponents\nand Leaded \nComponents\n \n \n \n \n \n Chassis  \n Solder (ground)  \n \nElectrode Pattern  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Solder Resist  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lead Wire  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Solder Resist  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lead Wire  Soldering Iron  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Solder Resist  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ｿﾙﾀﾞﾚｼﾞｽﾄ  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Solder Resist  \n \nJEMCGC-03007C 20\n2.

Board Design \n    When designing the board, keep in mind that \n    the amount of strain which occurs will increase \n\u3000 depending on the sizeand material of the board.\n2.Item to be confirmed for Flow sordering\n\u3000 If you want to temporarily attach the capacitor\n\u3000 to the board using an adhesive agent before\n\u3000 soldering the capacitor, first be sure that the\n\u3000 conditions are appropriate for affixing the\n\u3000 capacitor. If the dimensions of the land, the type of adhesive,the amount of coating, the contact surface area,\n\u3000 the curing temperature, or other conditions are inappropriate, the characteristics of the capacitor may deteriorate.\n1. Selection of Adhesive\n 1-1. Depending on the type of adhesive, there may be a decrease in insulation resistance. In addition, there is a chance\n         that the capacitor might crack from contractile stress due to the difference in the contraction rate of the capacitor\n         and the adhesive.\n 1-2. If there is not enough adhesive, the contact surface area is too small, or the curing temperature or curing time\n        are inadequate, the adhesive strength will be insufficient and the capacitor may loosen or become disconnected\n        during transportation or soldering. If there is too much adhesive, for example if it overflows onto the land, the result\n        could be soldering defects, loss of electrical connection, insufficient curing, or slippage after the capacitor is mounted.\n        Furthermore, if the curing temperature is too high or the curing time is too long, not only will the adhesive strength\n        be reduced, but solderability may also suffer due to the effects of oxidation on the terminations (outer electrodes)\n       of the capacitor and the land surface on the board.\n\u3000(1) Selection of Adhesive\n      \u3000Epoxy resins are a typical class of adhesive. To select the proper adhesive, consider the following points.\n   \u30001) There must be enough adhesive strength to prevent the component from loosening or slipping during the\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 mounting process.\n   \u30002) The adhesive strength must not decrease when exposed to moisture during soldering.\n  \u3000 3) The adhesive must have good coatability and shape retention properties.\n  \u3000 4) The adhesive must have a long pot life.\n   \u30005) The curing time must be short.\n \u3000  6) The adhesive must not be corrosive to the exterior of the capacitor or the board.\n \u3000  7) The adhesive must have good insulation properties.\n\u3000   8) The adhesive must not emit toxic gases or otherwise be harmful to health.\n\u3000   9) The adhesive must be free of halogenated compounds.\n\u3000(2) Use the following illustration as a guide to the amount of adhesive to apply.\n\u3000\u3000Chip\u3000Dimension (L/W) \u3000Code:18/21/31Notice\n \nRelationship with amount of strain to the board thickness, length, width, etc.]  \n \n \n \n \n \n ε=  3PL \n2Ewh2 Relationship between load and strain  \nWhen the load is constant, the following relationship can be established.  \n· As the distance between the supporting points (L) incre ases,the amount of  strain also increases.  \n→Reduce the distance between the supporting points.  \n· As the elastic modulus (E) decreases, the amount of strain increases.  \n→Increase the elastic modulus.  \n · As the board width (w) decreases, the amount of strain  increases.  \n→Increase the width of the board.  \n · As the board thickness (h) decreases, the amount of strain increases.  \n→Increase the thickness of the board.  \nSince the board thickness is squared, the effect on the amount of strain becomes even greater.  ε：Strain on center of board ( μst)  \nL：Distance between supporting points (mm)  \nw ：Board width (mm)  \nh ：Board thickness (mm)  \nE ：Elastic modulus of board (N/m2=Pa)  \nY ：Deflection (mm)  \nP ：Load (N)  Y P \nh \nw L \nLand\nResistAdhesive\nCross Sectional ViewResist\nSide View\nJEMCGC-03007C 22\n2.Flux\n 2-1. An excessive amount of flux generates a large quantity of flux gas, which can cause a deterioration of solderability,\n     \u3000 so apply flux thinly and evenly throughout. (A foaming system is generally used for flow solderring.)\n   \n 2-2. Flux containing too high a percentage of halide may cause corrosion of the terminations unless there is \n\u3000      sufficient cleaning. Use flux with a halide content of 0.1% max.\n 2-3. Strong acidic flux can corrode the capacitor and degrade its performance.\n         Please check the quality of capacitor after mounting.\n3.Leaching of the terminations\n   Set temperature and time to ensure that leaching of the \n   terminations does not exceed  25% of the chip end \n   area as a single chip (full length of the edge A-B-C-D \n   shown at right) and 25% of the length A-B shown as \n   mounted on substrate.\n3.Reflow  soldering\n   The flux in the solder paste contains halogen-based substances and organic acids as activators.\n\u3000 Strong acidic flux can corrode the capacitor and degrade its performance.\n   Please check the quality of capacitor after mounting.\n4.Washing\n1. Please evaluate the capacitor using actual cleaning equipment and conditions to confirm the quality, \n    and select the solvent for cleaning. \n2. Unsuitable cleaning may leave residual flux or other foreign substances, causing deterioration of\n    electrical characteristics and the reliability of the capacitors.\n5.Coating\n1. A crack may be caused in the capacitor due to the stress of the thermal contraction of the resin during curing process.\n    The stress is affected by the amount of resin and curing contraction. Select a resin with low curing contraction.\n    The difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between a coating resin or a molding resin and the capacitor \n    may cause the destruction and deterioration of the capacitor such as a crack or peeling, and lead to the deterioration\n    of insulation resistance or dielectric breakdown.\n    Select a resin for which the thermal expansion coefficient is as close to that of the capacitor as possible.\n    A silicone resin can be used as an under-coating to buffer against the stress.\n2. Select a resin that is less hygroscopic.\n    Using hygroscopic resins under high humidity conditions may cause the deterioration of the insulation resistance \n    of a capacitor. An epoxy resin can be used as a less hygroscopic resin.\n3．The halogen system substance and organic acid are included in coating material, and a chip corrodes\n\u3000\u3000by the kind of Coating material.

The performance of a capacitor may be affected by the conditions during transportation.\n 1-1. The capacitors shall be protected against excessive temperature, humidity and mechanical force during transportation.\n          (1) Climatic condition \n             \u3000･ low air temperature : -40 ℃\n                 ･ change of temperature air/air : -25 ℃/+25℃\n                 ･ low air pressure : 30 kPa\n                 ･ change of air pressure : 6 kPa/min.\n         (2) Mechanical condition \n                Transportation shall be done in such a way that the boxes are not deformed and forces are not directly passed\n                on to the inner packaging.\n 1-2. Do not apply excessive vibration, shock, or pressure to the capacitor.\n         (1) When excessive mechanical shock or pressure is applied to a capacitor, chipping or cracking may occur \n               in the ceramic body of the capacitor.\n         (2) When the sharp edge of an air driver, a soldering iron, tweezers, a chassis, etc. impacts strongly on the surface\n               of the capacitor, the capacitor may crack and short-circuit.\n 1-3. Do not use a capacitor to which excessive shock was applied by dropping etc.\n         A capacitor dropped accidentally during processing may be damaged.\n2.Characteristics Evaluation in the Actual System\n1. Evaluate the capacitor in the actual system,to confirm that there is no problem with the performance and specification \n     values in a finished product before using.\n2. Since a voltage dependency and temperature dependency exists in the capacitance of high dielectric type ceramic \n     capacitors, the capacitance may change depending on the operating conditions in the actual system.\n     Therefore,be sure to evaluate the various characteristics, such as the leakage current and noise absorptivity,\n     which will affect the capacitance value of the capacitor.\n3. In addition,voltages exceeding the predetermined surge may be applied to the capacitor by the inductance in \n     the actual system. Evaluate the surge resistance in the actual system as required.Notice\nJEMCGC-03007C 24\nNOTE\n1.Please make sure that your product has been evaluated in view of your specifications with our\n   product being mounted to your product.\n2.Your are requested not to use our product deviating from this product specification.\n3.We consider it not appropriate to include any terms and conditions with regard to the business \n   transaction in the product specifications, drawings or other technical documents.
