Laser radiation incident on the optical system shall be axial and non-\npolarized.\nUpper Limit to Objective Laser Input \nDetermine the upper limit value of laser input under the following conditions if the laser radiation directly enters the objective.Laser radiation incident on the optical system shall be axial. Each VMU and FS70 series of Mitutoyo microscope units uses a built-in laser [mainly, Nd-YAG laser fundamental wave (1064nm), second harmonic \n(532nm), third harmonic (355nm) and fourth harmonic (266nm)] to allow laser machining. In laser machining with a laser-equipped microscope unit and a microscope objective, high-power laser irradiation is not allowed for the purpose of microfabrication.

Telecentric illumination\nThis illuminating optical system is designed so that principal light passes \nthrough the focal point.  This system has the advantage of retaining the size of the image center even if it is out of focus (although the circumference of the image is defocused).  This illumination system provides an even illumination intensity over the entire ﬁ  eld of view.\n14. Aperture diaphragm\nThis diaphragm adjusts the amount of light passing through and is related to the brightness and resolving power of an optical system.  This diaphragm is especially useful in width dimension measurement of cylindrical objects with contour illumination, and provides the highest degree of correct measurement/observation by suppressing diffraction in an optimal aperture.\n15. Field stop\nThis diaphragm is used for blocking out unwanted light and thereby preventing it from degrading the image.• Spot diameterIf a beam of light with a uniformly distributed intensity enters an objective from the rear, the beam is condensed to a spot of ﬁ  nite size.  This size is known as the spot diameter.  The approximate value of a spot diameter is calculated from the following expression.\nHowever, the above expression cannot be applied if the light source is a \nlaser beam of which the intensity forms a Gaussian distribution on the cross section.  The diameter of a laser beam is generally indicated by 1/e\n2 \nof the peak value, i.e. 13.5% of the peak value.  The spot diameter of a laser beam is calculated from the following expression.ømm =2 x N.A. x f\nøµm=1.22xλ\nN.A.\nøµm =95Beam splitterImaging system\nIlluminated ﬁeld of viewRelay lens Field stopAperture\ndiaphragm Condenser lens Fiber-optic cable\nObjectivePupil diameter\nBeam spot diameter\n4xλxf\nπxD10. Bright ﬁ  eld illumination and dark ﬁ  eld illumination\nBright ﬁ  eld illumination directly lights the specimen with a solid cone \nof rays and is the simplest method available.  Dark ﬁ  eld illumination uses a hollow cone of rays formed by an opaque stop at the center of the condenser large enough to prevent direct light from entering the objective.  The specimen is placed at the concentration of the light cone, and is seen with light scattered or diffracted by it, therefore scratches and dents on the specimen surface are illuminated while the rest remains dark.\n11. Apochromatic objective and achromatic objective\nAn apochromatic objective is corrected for chromatic aberration at the \nred, blue, and yellow wavelengths.  An achromatic objective is corrected \nfor chromatic aberration at the red and yellow wavelengths only.\n12. Koehler illumination\nKöhler illumination overcomes the disadvantages of other schemes by \ncausing parallel rays to light the specimen so that, because they will not be in focus, the image of the specimen will not include an image of the light source.16. Plan\nDenotes an objective lens that produces a ﬂ  at (planar) image by correcting the spherical aberration/curvature of the ﬁ  eld of an achromatic lens or an apochromatic lens.  All Mitutoyo FS series objectives are plan apochromat.\n17. Vignetting\nThis unwanted effect is the reduction of an image\'s brightness or saturation at the periphery compared to the image center.  May be caused by external (lens hood) or internal features (dimensions of a multi-element lens).\n18. Flare\nLens ﬂ  are is typically seen as several starbursts, rings, or circles in a row across the image or view, caused by unwanted image formation mechanisms, such as internal reﬂ  ection and scattering of light.\n19. Double image\nAn image degrading a phenomenon in which an image appears as if it is a double image due to redundant light projection and optical interference within the optical system.\n20. Pupil Diameter and Spot Diameter of an Objective\n• Pupil diameterDenotes the maximum diameter of a parallel light ﬂ  ux along the optical axis that can enter an objective from the rear.  The pupil diameter is calculated according to the following expression.\n200 1607 (1) A-(CH)HS , Printed in Japan\nCoordinate Measuring Machines\nSensor SystemsVision Measuring Systems\nTest Equipment\nand SeismometersForm Measurement\nDigital Scale and DRO SystemsOptical Measuring\nSmall Tool Instruments\nand Data Management\nhttp://www.mitutoyo.co.jp/global.htmlFind additional product literature \nand our product catalogue\nNote: Product illustrations are without obligation.
