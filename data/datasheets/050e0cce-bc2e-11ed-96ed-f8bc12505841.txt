#### Description:
The WR28 Band Pass Filter (P/N: 28LB-BP-36720-37120_Cu) is a passive microwave component designed to allow signals within a specific frequency range to pass while attenuating signals outside that range. It is constructed using copper material and is designed for use in waveguide applications, specifically in the WR28 waveguide standard.

#### Typical Applications:
This band pass filter is typically used in high-frequency communication systems, radar systems, and other microwave applications where selective frequency filtering is required. It is particularly useful in applications such as:
- **Telecommunications:** To filter out unwanted frequencies and allow only the desired signal to pass through.
- **Radar Systems:** To enhance signal clarity by rejecting out-of-band signals.
- **Test Equipment:** In laboratory settings for signal processing and analysis.
- **Satellite Communication:** To ensure that only specific frequency bands are utilized for transmission and reception.

This component is essential for maintaining signal integrity and performance in high-frequency applications.
