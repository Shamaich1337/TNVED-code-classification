Its small size and inter-\nnal bias circuitry make it ideal for applications whereboard space is limited.\n__________Applications Information\nExternal Components\nAs shown in the Typical Operating Circuit , the\nMAX2650 is easy to use. Input and output seriescapacitors may be necessary to block DC bias volt-ages (generated by the MAX2650) from interacting withadjacent circuitry. These capacitors must be largeenough to contribute negligible reactance in a 50 Ωsys-\ntem at the minimum operating frequency. Use the fol-lowing equation to calculate their minimum value:\nwhere f (in MHz) is the minimum operating frequency.\nThe V\nCCpin must be RF bypassed for correct opera-\ntion. To accomplish this, connect a capacitor betweenthe V\nCCpin and ground, as close to the package as is\npractical. Use the same equation given above (for DCblocking capacitor values) to calculate the minimumcapacitor value. If there are long V\nCClines on the PC\nboard, additional bypassing may be necessary. Thismay be done further away from the package, at yourdiscretion.\nProper grounding of the GND pin is essential. If the PC\nboard uses a topside RF ground, the GND pin shouldconnect directly to it. For a board where the groundplane is not on the component side, the best techniqueis to connect the GND pin to it through multiple platedthrough-holes.PC Board Layout Example\nAn example PC board layout is given in Figure 1. Ituses FR-4 with 31mil layer thickness between the RFlines and the ground plane. The board satisfies all theabove requirements.\nCBLOCK  =53,000\nf(pF)MAX2650DC-to-Microwave, +5V Low-Noise Amplifier\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 5Figure 1.
