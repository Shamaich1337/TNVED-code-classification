A high switching \nfrequency of typically 2.5 MHz allows the use of small \ninductors and provides fast transient response as well \nas high output voltage accuracy by use of the DCS-\nControl topology.\nWith their wide operating input voltage range of 3 V \nto 17 V, the devices are ideally suited for systems \npowered from either a Li-Ion or other batteries as \nwell as from 12-V intermediate power rails. They \nsupport up to 3-A continuous output current at output \nvoltages between 0.9 V and 6 V (with 100% duty \ncycle mode). The output voltage start-up ramp is \ncontrolled by the soft-start pin, which allows operation \nas either a stand-alone power supply or in tracking \nconfigurations. Power sequencing is also possible by \nconfiguring the Enable and open-drain Power Good \npins.\nIn power save mode, the devices draw quiescent \ncurrent of approximately 17 μA from V IN. Power save \nmode, entered automatically and seamlessly if the \nload is small, maintains high efficiency over the entire \nload range. In shutdown mode, the device is turned \noff and shutdown current consumption is less than 2 \nμA.\nThe device, available in adjustable and fixed output \nvoltage versions, is packaged in a 16-pin VQFN \npackage measuring 3 mm × 3 mm (RGT).\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPS6213x VQFN (16) 3.00 mm × 3.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nPVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGNDTPS621310.1 \x85F\n3.3 nF10 \x85F(3 .. 17) V\n100 k\r\n22 \x85F1 / 2.2 µH\n1.8 V / 3 A\nTypical Application Schematic\n405060708090100\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0VIN=5V VIN=12V VIN=17V\nOutput Current (A)Efficiency (%)\nVOUT=3.3V\nfsw=1.25MHz\nG001 \nEfficiency vs Output CurrentTPS62130 , TPS62130A , TPS62131 , TPS62132 , TPS62133\nSLVSAG7F  – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

This control loop takes information about output voltage changes and feeds it directly to a fast \ncomparator stage. It sets the switching frequency, which is constant for steady state operating conditions, and \nprovides immediate response to dynamic load changes. To get accurate DC load regulation, a voltage feedback \nloop is used. The internally compensated regulation network achieves fast and stable operation with small \nexternal components and low-ESR capacitors.\nThe DCS-Control topology supports PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) mode for medium and heavy load \nconditions and a power save mode at light loads. During PWM, the device operates at its nominal switching \nfrequency in continuous conduction mode. This frequency is typically approximately 2.5 MHz or 1.25 MHz with \na controlled frequency variation depending on the input voltage. If the load current decreases, the converter \nenters power save mode to sustain high efficiency down to very light loads. In power save mode, the switching \nfrequency decreases linearly with the load current. Since DCS-Control supports both operation modes within one \nsingle building block, the transition from PWM to power save mode is seamless without effects on the output \nvoltage.\nFixed output voltage versions provide the smallest solution size and lowest current consumption, requiring only \nfour external components. An internal current limit supports nominal output currents of up to 3 A.\nThe TPS6213x family offers both excellent DC voltage and superior load transient regulation, combined with \nvery low output voltage ripple, minimizing interference with RF circuits.www.ti.comTPS62130, TPS62130A, TPS62131, TPS62132, TPS62133\nSLVSAG7F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 7\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62130  TPS62130A  TPS62131  TPS62132  TPS62133\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\ncontrol logicSoft\nstartThermal\nShtdwnUVLO PG control\npower\ncontrol\nerror\namplifiergate\ndriveHS lim\nLS limPVIN PVIN AVIN PG\nPGND PGND AGNDcomp\ncomp\n+_\ntimer t ON\nDCS - ControlTMdirect control\n&\ncompensation\ncomparatorrampSW\nSW\nSWEN*\nSS/TR\nDEF*\nFSW*\nVOS\nFB\n*This pin is connected to a pull down resistor internally\n(see Feature Description section).\n* This pin is connected to a pulldown resistor internally (see Section 8.3).\nFigure 8-1.

TPS62131/2/3 (Fixed Output Voltage)\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Enable / Shutdown (EN)\nWhen Enable (EN) is set High, the device starts operation. Shutdown is forced if EN is pulled Low with a \nshutdown current of typically 1.5 µA. During shutdown, the internal power MOSFETs as well as the entire control \ncircuitry are turned off. The internal resistive divider pulls down the output voltage smoothly. The EN signal must \nbe set externally to High or Low. An internal pulldown resistor of approximately 400 k Ω is connected and keeps \nEN logic low, if Low is set initially and then the pin gets floating. It is disconnected if the pin is set High.\nConnecting the EN pin to an appropriate output signal of another power rail provides sequencing of multiple \npower rails.\n8.3.2 Soft Start / Tracking (SS/TR)\nThe internal soft start circuitry controls the output voltage slope during start-up. This avoids excessive inrush \ncurrent and ensures a controlled output voltage rise time. It also prevents unwanted voltage drops from high-\nimpedance power sources or batteries. When EN is set to start device operation, the device starts switching after \na delay of approximately 50 µs and V OUT rises with a slope controlled by an external capacitor connected to the \nSS/TR pin. See Figure 9-34  and Figure 9-35  for typical start-up operation.\nUsing a very small capacitor (or leaving SS/TR pin un-connected) provides fastest start-up behavior. There is no \ntheoretical limit for the longest start-up time. The TPS6213x can start into a pre-biased output. During monotonic \npre-biased start-up, both the power MOSFETs are not allowed to turn on until the internal ramp of the device \nsets an output voltage above the pre-bias voltage. As long as the output is below approximately 0.5 V, a reduced \ncurrent limit of typically 1.6 A is set internally. If the device is set to shutdown (EN = GND), undervoltage lockout, \nor thermal shutdown, an internal resistor pulls the SS/TR pin down to ensure a proper low level. Returning from \nthose states causes a new start-up sequence as set by the SS/TR connection.www.ti.comTPS62130, TPS62130A, TPS62131, TPS62132, TPS62133\nSLVSAG7F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62130  TPS62130A  TPS62131  TPS62132  TPS62133\nA voltage supplied to SS/TR can be used for tracking a primary voltage. The output voltage will follow this \nvoltage in both directions up and down (see Section 9).\n8.3.3 Power Good (PG)\nThe TPS6213x has a built-in power good (PG) function to indicate whether the output voltage has reached its \nappropriate level or not. The PG signal can be used for start-up sequencing of multiple rails. The PG pin is an \nopen-drain output that requires a pullup resistor (to any voltage below 7 V). It can sink 2 mA of current and \nmaintain its specified logic low level. With TPS62130, it is high impedance when the device is turned off due to \nEN, UVLO, or thermal shutdown. The TPS62130A features PG = Low in this case and can be used to actively \ndischarge V OUT (see Figure 9-41 ). V IN must remain present for the PG pin to stay Low. See the TPS62130A \nDifferences to TPS62130 Application Report  for application details. If not used, the PG pin should be connected \nto GND but may be left floating.\nspace\nTable 8-1.

Increasing the \nnominal voltage allows the user to adapt the power supply voltage to the variations of the application hardware. \nMore detailed information on voltage margining using TPS6213x can be found in Voltage Margining Using the \nTPS62130 Application Report . A pulldown resistor of approximately 400 k Ω is internally connected to the pin \nto ensure a proper logic level if the pin is high impedance or floating after initially set to Low. The resistor is \ndisconnected if the pin is set High.\n8.3.5 Frequency Selection (FSW)\nTo get high power density with a very small solution size, a high switching frequency allows the use of small \nexternal components for the output filter. However, switching losses increase with the switching frequency. If \nefficiency is the key parameter, more than solution size, the switching frequency can be set to half (1.25 MHz \n1Maximum allowed voltage is 7 V. Therefore, it is recommended to connect it to V OUT or PG, not V IN.TPS62130, TPS62130A, TPS62131, TPS62132, TPS62133\nSLVSAG7F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62130  TPS62130A  TPS62131  TPS62132  TPS62133\ntypical) by pulling FSW to High. It is mandatory to start with FSW = Low to limit inrush current, which can be \ndone by connecting the pin to V OUT or PG. Running with lower frequency, a higher efficiency, but also a higher \noutput voltage ripple, is achieved. Pull FSW to Low for high frequency operation (2.5 MHz typical). To get low \nripple and full output current at the lower switching frequency, it is recommended to use an inductor of at least \n2.2 µH. The switching frequency can be changed during operation, if needed. A pulldown resistor of about 400 \nkΩ is internally connected to the pin, acting the same way as at the DEF pin (see above).\n8.3.6 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nIf the input voltage drops, the undervoltage lockout prevents misoperation of the device by switching off both \nthe power FETs. The undervoltage lockout threshold is set typically to 2.7 V. The device is fully operational for \nvoltages above the UVLO threshold and turns off if the input voltage trips the threshold. The converter starts \noperation again once the input voltage exceeds the threshold by a hysteresis of typically 200 mV.\n8.3.7 Thermal Shutdown\nThe junction temperature (T J) of the device is monitored by an internal temperature sensor. If T J exceeds 160°C \n(typical), the device goes into thermal shutdown. Both the high-side and low-side power FETs are turned off \nand PG goes high impedance. When T J decreases below the hysteresis amount, the converter resumes normal \noperation, beginning with soft start. To avoid unstable conditions, a hysteresis of typically 20°C is implemented \non the thermal shutdown temperature.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Operation\nThe TPS6213x operates with pulse width modulation in continuous conduction mode (CCM) with a nominal \nswitching frequency of 2.5 MHz or 1.25 MHz, selectable with the FSW pin. The frequency variation in PWM is \ncontrolled and depends on V IN, VOUT, and the inductance. The device operates in PWM mode as long the output \ncurrent is higher than half the ripple current of the inductor. To maintain high efficiency at light loads, the device \nenters power save mode at the boundary to discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). This happens if the output \ncurrent becomes smaller than half the ripple current of the inductor.\n8.4.2 Power Save Mode Operation\nThe TPS6213x enters its built-in power save mode seamlessly if the load current decreases. This secures a \nhigh efficiency in light-load operation. The device remains in power save mode as long as the inductor current is \ndiscontinuous.\nIn power save mode, the switching frequency decreases linearly with the load current maintaining high efficiency. \nThe transition into and out of power save mode happens within the entire regulation scheme and is seamless in \nboth directions.\nThe TPS6213x includes a fixed on-time circuitry. An estimate for this on time in steady-state operation with FSW \n= Low is:\nnsVVt\nINOUT\nON 400/c215 /c61\n(1)\nFor very small output voltages, an absolute minimum on time of approximately 80 ns is kept to limit switching \nlosses. The operating frequency is thereby reduced from its nominal value, which keeps efficiency high. Also, the \noff time can reach its minimum value at high duty cycles. The output voltage remains regulated in such case. \nUsing t ON, the typical peak inductor current in power save mode can be approximated by:\nONOUT IN\npeak LPSM tLV VI /c215/c45/c61) (\n) (\n(2)\nWhen V IN decreases to typically 15% above V OUT, the TPS6213x does not enter power save mode, regardless \nof the load current. The device maintains output regulation in PWM mode.www.ti.comTPS62130, TPS62130A, TPS62131, TPS62132, TPS62133\nSLVSAG7F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62130  TPS62130A  TPS62131  TPS62132  TPS62133\n8.4.3 100% Duty-Cycle Operation\nThe duty cycle of the buck converter is given by D = V OUT / V IN and increases as the input voltage comes \nclose to the output voltage. In this case, the device starts 100% duty cycle operation turning on the high-side \nswitch 100% of the time. The high-side switch stays turned on as long as the output voltage is below the internal \nset point. This allows the conversion of small input to output voltage differences (for example, for the longest \noperation time of battery-powered applications). In 100% duty cycle mode, the low-side FET is switched off.\nThe minimum input voltage to maintain output voltage regulation, depending on the load current and the output \nvoltage level, can be calculated as:\n/c40 /c41L ) on ( DS OUT (min) OUT (min)IN R R I V V /c43 /c43 /c61\n(3)\nwhere\n•IOUT is the output current.\n•RDS(on)  is the R DS(on)  of the high-side FET.\n•RL is the DC resistance of the inductor used.\n8.4.4 Current Limit And Short Circuit Protection\nThe TPS6213x devices have protection against heavy load and short circuit events. If a short circuit is detected \n(VOUT drops below 0.5 V), the current limit is reduced to 1.6 A typically. If the output voltage rises above 0.5 \nV, the device runs in normal operation again. At heavy loads, the current limit determines the maximum output \ncurrent. If the current limit is reached, the high-side FET is turned off. Avoiding shoot-through current, then the \nlow-side FET switches on to allow the inductor current to decrease. The low-side current limit is typically 3.5 \nA. The high-side FET turns on again only if the current in the low-side FET has decreased below the low-side \ncurrent limit threshold.\nThe output current of the device is limited by the current limit. Due to internal propagation delay, the actual \ncurrent can exceed the static current limit during that time. The dynamic current limit can be calculated as \nfollows:\nPDL\nLIMF typ peak tLVI I /c215 /c43 /c61) (\n(4)\nwhere\n•ILIMF is the static current limit, specified in the Electrical Characteristics .\n•L is the inductor value.\n•VL is the voltage across the inductor (V IN - VOUT).\n•tPD is the internal propagation delay.\nThe current limit can exceed static values, especially if the input voltage is high and very small inductances are \nused.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe TPS6213x is a switched mode step-down converter that is able to convert a 3V- to 17-V input voltage into a \n0.9-V to 6-V output voltage, providing up to 3 A. The device needs a minimum amount of external components. \nApart from the LC output filter and the input capacitors, only the TPS62130 (TPS62130A) with adjustable output \nvoltage needs an additional resistive divider to set the output voltage level.\n9.2 Typical Application\nC3\n22uFVOUT / 3A\nTPS62130R1\nR2PVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGND100k1 / 2.2 µH\nC1\n10uF(3 .. 17)V\nC5\n3.3nFC7\n0.1uF\nFigure 9-1. 3-A Step-Down Converter for Point-Of-Load Power Supply Using the TPS62130\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nThe following design guideline provides a component selection to operate the device within the recommended \noperating conditions. Using the FSW pin, the design can be optimized for highest efficiency or smallest solution \nsize and lowest output voltage ripple. For highest efficiency set FSW = High and the device operates at the lower \nswitching frequency. For the smallest solution size and lowest output voltage ripple, set FSW = Low and the \ndevice operates with higher switching frequency.

For fixed output voltage versions, the FB pin is pulled \ndown internally and can be left floating. It is recommended to connect to AGND to improve thermal resistance. \nThe adjustable version can be programmed for output voltages from 0.9 V to 6 V by using a resistive divider \nfrom V OUT to AGND. The voltage at the FB pin is regulated to 800 mV. The value of the output voltage is \nset by the selection of the resistive divider from Equation 6 . It is recommended to choose resistor values that \nallow a current of at least 2 μA, meaning the value of R2 should not exceed 400 k Ω. Lower resistor values \nare recommended for the highest accuracy and most robust design. For applications requiring lowest current \nconsumption, the use of fixed output voltage versions is recommended.\n/c247\n/c248/c246/c231\n/c232/c230/c45 /c61 10.8VVR ROUT\n2 1\n(6)\nIn case the FB pin gets opened, the device clamps the output voltage at the VOS pin internally to approximately \n7.4 V.\n9.2.2.2 External Component Selection\nThe external components have to fulfill the needs of the application, but also the stability criteria of the devices \ncontrol loop. The TPS6213x is optimized to work within a range of external components. The inductance of \nthe LC output filter and capacitance have to be considered together, creating a double pole, responsible for \nthe corner frequency of the converter (see Section 9.2.2.4 ). Table 9-2  can be used to simplify the output \nfilter component selection. Checked cells represent combinations that are proven for stability by simulation \nand lab test. Further combinations should be checked for each individual application. See Optimizing the \nTPS62130/40/50/60 Output Filter Application Report  for details.\nTable 9-2.

The effective capacitance was considered to vary by +20% and -50%.\n(2) This LC combination is the standard value and recommended for most applications.\nThe TPS6213x can be run with an inductor as low as 1 µH. FSW should be set Low in this case. However, \nfor applications running with the low frequency setting (FSW = High) or with low input voltages, 2.2 µH is \nrecommended.\n9.2.2.2.1 Inductor Selection\nThe inductor selection is affected by several effects like inductor ripple current, output ripple voltage, PWM-to-\nPSM transition point, and efficiency. In addition, the inductor selected has to be rated for appropriate saturation \ncurrent and DC resistance (DCR).

The \nfollowing inductors have been used with the TPS6213x and are recommended for use:\nTable 9-3.

The architecture of the TPS6213x allows the use \nof tiny ceramic output capacitors with low-equivalent series resistance (ESR). These capacitors provide low \noutput voltage ripple and are recommended. To keep its low resistance up to high frequencies and to get narrow \ncapacitance variation with temperature, it is recommended to use X7R or X5R dielectric. Using a higher value \ncan have some advantages like smaller voltage ripple and a tighter DC output accuracy in power save mode \n(see Optimizing the TPS62130/40/50/60 Output Filter Application Report ).\nNote\nIn power save mode, the output voltage ripple depends on the output capacitance, its ESR, and the \npeak inductor current. Using ceramic capacitors provides small ESR and low ripple.\n9.2.2.2.2.2 Input Capacitor\nFor most applications, 10 µF will be sufficient and is recommended, though a larger value reduces input current \nripple further. The input capacitor buffers the input voltage for transient events and also decouples the converter www.ti.comTPS62130, TPS62130A, TPS62131, TPS62132, TPS62133\nSLVSAG7F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62130  TPS62130A  TPS62131  TPS62132  TPS62133\nfrom the supply. A low-ESR multilayer ceramic capacitor is recommended for best filtering and should be placed \nbetween PVIN and PGND as close as possible to those pins. Even though AVIN and PVIN must be supplied \nfrom the same input source, it is required to place a capacitance of 0.1 μF from AVIN to AGND, to avoid potential \nnoise coupling. An RC, low-pass filter from PVIN to AVIN can be used but is not required.\n9.2.2.2.2.3 Soft-Start Capacitor\nA capacitance connected between the SS/TR pin and AGND allows a user-programmable start-up slope of the \noutput voltage. A constant current source supports 2.5 µA to charge the external capacitance. The capacitor \nrequired for a given soft-start ramp time for the output voltage is given by:\n/c91 /c93FVAt CSS SS2515 2\n../c109/c215 /c61\n(10)\nwhere\n•CSS is the capacitance (F) required at the SS/TR pin.\n•tSS is the desired soft-start ramp time (s).\nNote\nDC Bias effect:  High capacitance ceramic capacitors have a DC Bias effect, which will have a strong \ninfluence on the final effective capacitance. Therefore the right capacitor value has to be chosen \ncarefully. Package size and voltage rating in combination with dielectric material are responsible for \ndifferences between the rated capacitor value and the effective capacitance.\n9.2.2.3 Tracking Function\nIf a tracking function is desired, the SS/TR pin can be used for this purpose by connecting it to an external \ntracking voltage. The output voltage tracks that voltage. If the tracking voltage is between 50 mV and 1.2 V, the \nFB pin will track the SS/TR pin voltage as described in Equation 11  and shown in Figure 9-2 .\nTRSS FB V V/ 64 . 0/c215 /c187\n(11)\nVFB [V]VSS/\nTR [V]\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.80.41.2\n0.8\nFigure 9-2. Voltage Tracking Relationship\nOnce the SS/TR pin voltage reaches approximately 1.2 V, the internal voltage is clamped to the internal \nfeedback voltage and device goes to normal regulation. This works for rising and falling tracking voltages with \nthe same behavior, as long as the input voltage is inside the recommended operating conditions. For decreasing \nSS/TR pin voltage, the device does not sink current from the output. So, the resulting decrease of the output \nvoltage can be slower than the SS/TR pin voltage if the load is light. When driving the SS/TR pin with an external \nvoltage, do not exceed the voltage rating of the SS/TR pin which is V IN + 0.3 V.\nIf the input voltage drops into undervoltage lockout or even down to zero, the output voltage will go to \nzero, independent of the tracking voltage. Figure 9-3  shows how to connect devices to get ratiometric and \nsimultaneous sequencing by using the tracking function.TPS62130, TPS62130A, TPS62131, TPS62132, TPS62133\nSLVSAG7F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62130  TPS62130A  TPS62131  TPS62132  TPS62133\nTPS62130PVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGND\nTPS62130PVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGNDR1\nR2VOUT1\nVOUT2\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFigure 9-3. Sequence For Ratiometric And Simultaneous Start-Up\nThe resistive divider of R1 and R2 can be used to change the ramp rate of V OUT2 faster, slower, or the same as \nVOUT1.\nA sequential start-up is achieved by connecting the PG pin of V OUT1 to the EN pin of V OUT2. A ratiometric \nstart-up sequence happens if both supplies are sharing the same soft-start capacitor. Equation 10  calculates \nthe soft-start time, though the SS/TR current has to be doubled. Details about these and other tracking \nand sequencing circuits are found in Sequencing and Tracking With the TPS621-Family and TPS821-Family \nApplication Report .\nNote\nIf the voltage at the FB pin is below its typical value of 0.8 V, the output voltage accuracy may have a \nwider tolerance than specified.\n9.2.2.4 Output Filter And Loop Stability\nThe devices of the TPS6213x family are internally compensated to be stable with L-C filter combinations \ncorresponding to a corner frequency to be calculated with Equation 12 :\nCLfLC/c215/c61\n/c11221\n(12)\nProven nominal values for inductance and ceramic capacitance are given in Table 9-2  and are recommended \nfor use.

The FB pin can be easily set down to lower \nvalues than nominal by using the SS/TR pin. With that, the voltage drop on the sense resistor is low to avoid \nexcessive power loss. Since this pin provides 2.5 µA, the feedback pin voltage can be adjusted by an external \nresistor per Equation 15 . This drop, proportional to the LED current, is used to regulate the output voltage \n(anode voltage) to a proper level to drive the LED. Both analog and PWM dimming are supported with the \nTPS62130. Figure 9-40  shows an application circuit, tested with analog dimming:\n22uF 10uF2.2 µH (4 .. 17) V\n0.1R 187kADIMPVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGNDTPS621300.1uF\nFigure 9-40.

The minimum input voltage has to be rated according the forward voltage needed by the LED \nused. More information is available in the Step-Down LED Driver With Dimming With the TPS621-Family and \nTPS821-Family Application Report .\n9.3.2 Active Output Discharge\nThe TPS62130A pulls the PG pin Low when the device is shut down by EN, UVLO, or thermal shutdown. \nConnecting PG to V OUT through a resistor can be used to discharge V OUT in those cases (see Figure 9-41 ). The \ndischarge rate can be adjusted by R3, which is also used to pull up the PG pin in normal operation. For reliability, \nkeep the maximum current into the PG pin less than 10 mA.\n22uFVout / 3A\n10uF1 / 2.2 µH (3 .. 17)V\n3.3nFPVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGNDR3\nR1\nR2TPS62130A\n0.1uF\nFigure 9-41.

As the former GND node now represents a voltage level below system ground, the voltage difference \nbetween V IN and V OUT has to be limited for operation to the maximum supply voltage of 17 V (see Equation 16 ).\nmaxIN OUT IN V V V /c163 /c43\n(16)www.ti.comTPS62130, TPS62130A, TPS62131, TPS62132, TPS62133\nSLVSAG7F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62130  TPS62130A  TPS62131  TPS62132  TPS62133\nTPS62130PVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGND2.2µH(3 .. 13.7)V10uF\n383k1.21M\n22uF\n-3.3V10uF\n3.3nF0.1uFFigure 9-42. –3.3-V Inverting Power Supply\nThe transfer function of the inverting power supply configuration differs from the buck mode transfer function, \nincorporating a right half plane zero additionally.

The output current of the \ninput power supply needs to be rated according to the output voltage and the output current of the power rail \napplication.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nA proper layout is critical for the operation of a switched mode power supply, even more at high switching \nfrequencies. Therefore, the PCB layout of the TPS6213x demands careful attention to ensure operation and to \nget the performance specified. A poor layout can lead to issues like the following:\n•Poor regulation (both line and load)\n•Stability and accuracy weaknesses\n•Increased EMI radiation\n•Noise sensitivity\nSee Figure 11-1  for the recommended layout of the TPS6213x, which is designed for common external ground \nconnections. Therefore, both AGND and PGND pins are directly connected to the exposed thermal pad. On \nthe PCB, the direct common ground connection of AGND and PGND to the exposed thermal pad and the \nsystem ground (ground plane) is mandatory. Also connect the VOS pin in the shortest way to V OUT at the output \ncapacitor. To avoid noise coupling into the VOS line, this connection should be separated from the V OUT power \nline/plane as shown in Section 11.2.\nProvide low inductive and resistive paths for loops with high di/dt. Therefore, paths conducting the switched load \ncurrent should be as short and wide as possible. Provide low capacitive paths (with respect to all other nodes) \nfor wires with high dv/dt. Therefore, the input and output capacitance should be placed as close as possible to \nthe IC pins and parallel wiring over long distances as well as narrow traces should be avoided. Loops which \nconduct an alternating current should outline an area as small as possible, as this area is proportional to the \nenergy radiated.\nSensitive nodes like FB and VOS need to be connected with short wires and not nearby high dv/dt signals \n(for example, SW). As they carry information about the output voltage, they should be connected as close as \npossible to the actual output voltage (at the output capacitor). The capacitor on the SS/TR pin and on AVIN as \nwell as the FB resistors, R1 and R2, should be kept close to the IC and connect directly to those pins and the \nsystem ground plane.\nThe exposed thermal pad must be soldered to the circuit board for mechanical reliability and to achieve \nappropriate power dissipation.\nThe recommended layout is implemented on the EVM and shown in the TPS6213x Buck Converter Evaluation \nModule User\'s Guide . Additionally, the Gebers for HPA505 EVM  are available for download.TPS62130, TPS62130A, TPS62131, TPS62132, TPS62133\nSLVSAG7F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62130  TPS62130A  TPS62131  TPS62132  TPS62133\n11.2 Layout Example\nspace\nVIN\nGNDAGND\nVOUTSW\nSWPG\nAVIN\nPVINPVIN\nPGNDENPGNDAGNDFB\nSW\nVOSSS/TRFSW DEFR1\nR2C7\nC1 C3C5\nL1\nFigure 11-1. Layout Example\n11.3 Thermal Information\nImplementation of integrated circuits in low-profile and fine-pitch surface-mount packages typically requires \nspecial attention to power dissipation. Many system-dependent issues such as thermal coupling, airflow, added \nheat sinks and convection surfaces, and the presence of other heat-generating components affect the power-\ndissipation limits of a given component.\nThree basic approaches for enhancing thermal performance are listed below:\n•Improving the power dissipation capability of the PCB design\n•Improving the thermal coupling of the component to the PCB by soldering the Exposed Thermal Pad\n•Introducing airflow in the system\nFor more details on how to use the thermal parameters, see the application notes: Thermal Characteristics of \nLinear and Logic Packages Using JEDEC PCB Designs Application Report  and Semiconductor and IC Package \nThermal Metrics Application Report .\nThe TPS6213x is designed for a maximum operating junction temperature (T J) of 125°C. Therefore, the \nmaximum output power is limited by the power losses that can be dissipated over the actual thermal resistance, \ngiven by the package and the surrounding PCB structures. Since the thermal resistance of the package is \nfixed, increasing the size of the surrounding copper area and improving the thermal connection to the IC can \nreduce the thermal resistance. To get an improved thermal behavior, it is recommended to use top layer metal to \nconnect the device with wide and thick metal lines. Internal ground layers can connect to vias directly under the \nIC for improved thermal performance.\nIf short circuit or overload conditions are present, the device is protected by limiting internal power dissipation. \nExperimental data, taken from the TPS62130 EVM, shows the maximum ambient temperature (without \nadditional cooling like airflow or heat sink), that can be allowed to limit the junction temperature to at most \n125°C (see Figure 9-38 ).www.ti.comTPS62130, TPS62130A, TPS62131, TPS62132, TPS62133\nSLVSAG7F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62130  TPS62130A  TPS62131  TPS62132  TPS62133\n12 Device and Documentation Support\n12.1 Device Support\n12.1.1 Third-Party Products Disclaimer\nTI\'S PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DOES NOT \nCONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT REGARDING THE SUITABILITY OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES \nOR A WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR ENDORSEMENT OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, EITHER \nALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ANY TI PRODUCT OR SERVICE.\n12.2 Documentation Support\n12.2.1 Related Documentation\n•Texas Instruments, Voltage Margining Using the TPS62130 Application Report\n•Texas Instruments, Using the TPS62150 as Step-Down LED Driver With Dimming Application Report\n•Texas Instruments, Using the TPS6215x in an Inverting Buck-Boost Topology Application Report\n•Texas Instruments, Optimizing the TPS62130/40/50/60/70 Output Filter Application Report\n•Texas Instruments, TPS62130/40/50 Sequencing and Tracking Application Report\n•Texas Instruments, Optimizing Transient Response of Internally Compensated dc-dc Converters With \nFeedforward Capacitor Application Report\n•Texas Instruments, Using a Feedforward Capacitor to Improve Stability and Bandwidth of \nTPS62130/40/50/60/70 Application Report\n•Texas Instruments, Thermal Characteristics of Linear and Logic Packages Using JEDEC PCB Designs \nApplication Report\n•Texas Instruments, Semiconductor and IC Package Thermal Metrics Application Report\n•Texas Instruments, TPS62130EVM-505, TPS62140EVM-505, and TPS62150EVM-505 Evaluation Modules \nUser\'s Guide\n•Texas Instruments, EVM Gerber Data\n12.3 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
