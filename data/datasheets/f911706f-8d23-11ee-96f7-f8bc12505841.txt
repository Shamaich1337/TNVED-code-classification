Typical desaturation protected gate drive circuit, noninverting.\nOutput Control\nThe outputs (V OUT and FAULT) of the HCPL -316J are con -\ntrolled by the combination of V IN, UVLO and a detected \nIGBT Desat condition. As indicated in the below table, the \nHCPL -316J can be configured as inverting or non-invert -\ning using the V IN+ or V IN- inputs respectively. When an in -\nverting configuration is desired, V IN+ must be held high \nand V IN- toggled. When a non-inverting configuration is \ndesired, V IN- must be held low and V IN+ toggled. Once \nUVLO is not active (V CC2 - VE > V UVLO ), VOUT is allowed to \ngo high, and the DESAT (pin 14) detection feature of the \nHCPL -316J will be the primary source of IGBT protection. \nUVLO is needed to ensure DESAT is functional. Once V U-\nVLO+  > 11.6 V, DESAT will remain functional until V UVLO-  < \n12.4 V. Thus, the DESAT detection and UVLO features of \nthe HCPL -316J work in conjunction to ensure constant \nIGBT protection.* THESE COMPONENTS ARE ONLY REQUIRED WHEN NEGATIVE GATE DRIVE IS IMPLEMENTED.\nDescription of Operation during Fault Condition\n1.

TTL input \nlogic levels allow direct interface with a microcontroller, \nand an optically isolated power output stage drives \nIGBTs with power ratings of up to 150 A and 1200 V. A \nhigh speed internal optical link minimizes the propaga -\ntion delays between the microcontroller and the IGBT \nwhile allowing the two systems to operate at very large \ncommon mode voltage differences that are common in \nindustrial motor drives and other power switching ap -\nplications. An output IC provides local protection for \nthe IGBT to prevent damage during overcurrents, and a \nsecond optical link provides a fully isolated fault status \nfeedback signal for the microcontroller. A built in “watch -\ndog” circuit monitors the power stage supply voltage to \nprevent IGBT caused by insufficient gate drive voltages. \nThis integrated IGBT gate driver is designed to increase \nthe performance and reliability of a motor drive without \nthe cost, size, and complexity of a discrete design.\nTwo light emitting diodes and two integrated circuits \nhoused in the same SO -16 package provide the input \ncontrol circuitry, the output power stage, and two op -\ntical channels. The input Buffer IC is designed on a bi -\npolar process, while the output Detector IC is designed \nmanufactured on a high voltage BiCMOS/Power DMOS process. The forward optical signal path, as indicated by \nLED1, transmits the gate control signal. The return opti -\ncal signal path, as indicated by LED2, transmits the fault \nstatus feedback signal. Both optical channels are com -\npletely controlled by the input and output ICs respec -\ntive-ly, making the internal isolation boundary transpar -\nent to the microcontroller.\nUnder normal operation, the input gate control signal di -\nrectly controls the IGBT gate through the isolated output \ndetector IC. LED2 remains off and a fault latch in the in -\nput buffer IC is disabled. When an IGBT fault is detected, \nthe output detector IC immediately begins a “soft” shut -\ndown sequence, reducing the IGBT current to zero in a \ncontrolled manner to avoid potential IGBT damage from \ninductive overvoltages. Simultaneously, this fault status \nis transmitted back to the input buffer IC via LED2, where \nthe fault latch disables the gate control input and the ac -\ntive low fault output alerts the microcontroller.\nDuring power -up, the Under Voltage Lockout (UVLO) fea -\nture prevents the application of insufficient gate voltage \nto the IGBT, by forcing the HCPL -316J’s output low. Once \nthe output is in the high state, the DESAT (V CE) detec -\ntion feature of the HCPL -316J provides IGBT protection. \nThus, UVLO and DESAT work in conjunction to provide \nconstant IGBT protection.\nSHIELDDESAT\nFAULTUVLO\nOUTPUT ICSHIELDINPUT IC\nRESET5\nFAULT6VIN+1\nVIN-2\nVCC13VCC213\n12\nVOUT11\nVEE9,10\nVE16DESAT14VC\nVLED2+ GND115 4VLED1-\n7 8VLED1+\nLED2LED1 D\nR\nI\nV\nE\nR\n4Package Pin Out\n16\n15\n14\n13\n12\n1110 91\n2\n3\n4\n5\n678V\nE\nVLED2+\nDESAT\nVCC2\nVC\nVOUT\nVEE\nVEEVIN+\nVIN-\nVCC1\nGND1\nRESET\nFAULT\nVLED1+\nVLED1-\nPin Descriptions\nSymbol Description Symbol Description\nVIN+ Noninverting gate drive voltage output (V OUT) V E Common (IGBT emitter) output supply voltage.  \n control input.  \nVIN- Inverting gate drive voltage output VLED2+  LED 2 anode.

Device considered a two terminal device: pins 1 - 8 shorted together and pins 9 - 16 shorted together. \n  4. In order to achieve the absolute maximum power dissipation specified, pins 4, 9, and 10 require ground plane connections and may require \nairflow. See the Thermal Model section in the application notes at the end of this data sheet for details on how to estimate junction tem -\nperature and power dissipation. In most cases the absolute maximum output IC junction temperature is the limiting factor. The actual power \ndissipation achievable will depend on the application environment (PCB Layout, air flow, part placement, etc.). See the Recommended PCB \nLayout section in the application notes for layout considerations. Output IC power dissipation is derated linearly at 10 mW/°C above 90°C. \nInput IC power dissipation does not require derating.\n 5. Maximum pulse width = 10 µs, maximum duty cycle = 0.2%. This value is intended to allow for compo nent tolerances for designs with I O \npeak minimum = 2.0 A. See Applications section for additional details on I OH peak. Derate linearly from 3.0 A at +25°C to 2.5 A at +100°C. This \ncompensates for increased I OPEAK  due to changes in V OL over temperature.\n 6. This supply is optional. Required only when negative gate drive is implemented.\n 7. Maximum pulse width = 50 µs, maximum duty cycle = 0.5%.\n 8. See the Slow IGBT Gate Discharge During Fault Condition section in the applications notes at the end of this data sheet for further details.\n 9. 15 V is the recommended minimum operating positive supply voltage (V CC2 - VE) to ensure adequate margin in excess of the maximum V U-\nVLO+  threshold of 13.5 V. For High Level Output Voltage testing, V OH is measured with a dc load current. When driving capacitive loads, V OH \nwill approach V CC as I OH approaches zero units.\n10. Maximum pulse width = 1.0 ms, maximum duty cycle = 20%.\n11. Once V OUT of the HCPL-316J is allowed to go high (V CC2 - VE > V UVLO ), the DESAT detection feature of the HCPL-316J will be the primary \nsource of IGBT protection. UVLO is needed to ensure DESAT is functional. Once V UVLO+  > 11.6 V, DESAT will remain functional until V UVLO-  < \n12.4 V. Thus, the DESAT detection and UVLO features of the HCPL-316J work in conjunction to ensure constant IGBT protection.\n12. See the Blanking Time Control section in the applications notes at the end of this data sheet for further details.\n13. This is the “increasing” (i.e. turn-on or “positive going” direction) of V CC2 - VE.\n14. This is the “decreasing” (i.e. turn-off or “negative going” direction) of  V CC2 - VE.\n15. This load condition approximates the gate load of a 1200 V/75A IGBT.\n16. Pulse Width Distortion (PWD) is defined as |t PHL - tPLH| for any given unit.\n17. As measured from V IN+, VIN- to V OUT.\n18. The difference between t PHL and t PLH between any two HCPL-316J parts under the same test conditions.\n19. Supply Voltage Dependent. \n20. This is the amount of time from when the DESAT threshold is exceeded, until the FAULT output goes low. \n21. This is the amount of time the DESAT threshold must be exceeded before V OUT begins to go low, and the FAULT output to go low. \n22. This is the amount of time from when RESET is asserted low, until FAULT output goes high. The minimum specification of 3 µs is the guaran -\nteed minimum FAULT signal pulse width when the HCPL-316J is configured for Auto-Reset. See the Auto-Reset section in the applications \nnotes at the end of this data sheet for further details.\n23. Common mode transient immunity in the high state is the maximum tolerable  \ndVCM/dt of the common mode pulse, V CM, to assure that the output will remain in the high state (i.e., V O > 15 V or FAULT > 2 V). A 100 pF and \na 3K Ω pull-up resistor is needed in fault detection mode.\n24. Common mode transient immunity in the low state is the maximum tolerable dV CM/dt of the common mode pulse, V CM, to assure that the \noutput will remain in a low state (i.e., V O < 1.0 V or FAULT < 0.8 V).\n25. Does not include LED2 current during fault or blanking capacitor discharge current.\n26. To clamp the output voltage at V CC - 3 V BE, a pull-down resistor between the output and V EE is recommended to sink a static current of 650 \nµA while the output is high. See the Output Pull-Down Resistor section in the application notes at the end of this data sheet if an output pull-\ndown resistor is not used.\n27. The recommended output pull-down resistor between V OUT and V EE does not contribute any output current when V OUT = V EE.\n28. In most applications V CC1 will be powered up first (before V CC2) and powered down last (after V CC2). This is desirable for maintaining control \nof the IGBT gate. In applications where V CC2 is powered up first, it is important to ensure that V in+ remains low until V CC1 reaches the proper \noperating voltage (minimum 4.5 V) to avoid any momentary instability at the output during V CC1 ramp-up or ramp-down.\n11Performance Plots\nFigure 3.

These failure \nmodes can be grouped into four basic categories: phase \nand/or rail supply short circuits due to user misconnect \nor bad wiring, control signal failures due to noise or com -\nputational errors, overload conditions induced by the \nload, and component failures in the gate drive circuitry. \nUnder any of these fault conditions, the current through \nthe IGBTs can increase rapidly, causing excessive power \ndissipation and heating. The IGBTs become damaged \nwhen the current load approaches the saturation cur -\nrent of the device, and the collector to emitter voltage \nrises above the saturation voltage level. The drastically \nincreased power dissipation very quickly overheats the \npower device and destroys it. To prevent damage to the \ndrive, fault protection must be implemented to reduce \nor turn- off the overcurrents during a fault condition.\nA circuit providing fast local fault detection and shut -\ndown is an ideal solution, but the number of required \ncomponents, board space consumed, cost, and complex -\nity have until now limited its use to high performance \ndrives. The features which this circuit must have are high \nspeed, low cost, low resolution, low power dissipation, \nand small size.\nApplications Information The HCPL -316J satisfies these cri -\nteria by combining a high speed, high output current \ndriver, high voltage optical isolation between the input \nand output, local IGBT desaturation detection and shut \ndown, and an optically isolated fault status feedback sig -\nnal into a single 16-pin surface mount package.\nThe fault detection method, which is adopted in the \nHCPL -316J, is to monitor the saturation (collector) volt -\nage of the IGBT and to trigger a local fault shutdown se -\nquence if the collector voltage exceeds a predetermined \nthreshold. A small gate discharge device slowly reduces \nthe high short circuit IGBT current to prevent damaging \nvoltage spikes. Before the dissipated energy can reach \ndestructive levels, the IGBT is shut off. During the off  \nstate of the IGBT, the fault detect circuitry is simply dis -\nabled to prevent false ‘fault’ signals.The alternative protection scheme of measuring IGBT \ncurrent to prevent desaturation is effective if the short \ncircuit capability of the power device is known, but \nthis method will fail if the gate drive voltage decreases \nenough to only partially turn on the IGBT. By directly \nmeasuring the collector voltage, the HCPL -316J limits \nthe power dissipation in the IGBT even with insufficient \ngate drive voltage. Another more subtle advantage of \nthe desaturation detection method is that power dissi -\npation in the IGBT is monitored, while the current sense \nmethod relies on a preset current threshold to predict \nthe safe limit of operation. Therefore, an overly- conser -\nvative overcurrent threshold is not needed to protect \nthe IGBT.\nRecommended Application Circuit\nThe HCPL -316J has both inverting and non-inverting \ngate control inputs, an active low reset input, and an \nopen collector fault output suitable for wired ‘OR’ appli -\ncations. The recommended application circuit shown in \nFigure 62 illustrates a typical gate drive implementation \nusing the HCPL -316J.\nThe four supply bypass capacitors (0.1 µF) provide the \nlarge transient currents necessary during a switching \ntransition. Because of the transient nature of the charg -\ning currents, a low current (5 mA) power supply suffices. \nThe desat diode and 100 pF capacitor are the necessary \nexternal components for the fault detection circuitry. \nThe gate resistor (10 Ω) serves to limit gate charge cur -\nrent and indirectly control the IGBT collector voltage \nrise and fall times. The open collector fault output has \na passive 3.3 kΩ pull-up resistor and a 330 pF filtering \ncapacitor. A 47 kΩ pulldown resistor on V OUT provides a \nmore predictable high level output voltage (V OH). In this \napplication, the IGBT gate driver will shut down when a \nfault is detected and will not resume switching until the \nmicrocontroller applies a reset signal.\n21Figure 62. Recommended application circuit.\nDescription of Operation/Timing\nFigure 63 below illustrates input and output waveforms \nunder the conditions of normal operation, a desat fault \ncondition, and normal reset behavior.\nNormal Operation\nDuring normal operation, V OUT of the HCPL-316J is con -\ntrolled by either V IN+ or V IN-, with the IGBT collector-to-\nemitter voltage being monitored through D DESAT . The \nFAULT output is high and the RESET input should be held \nhigh. See Figure 63.\nFigure 63. Timing diagram.Fault Condition\nWhen the voltage on the DESAT pin exceeds 7 V while \nthe IGBT is on, V OUT is slowly brought low in order to \n“softly” turn-off the IGBT and prevent large di/dt induced \nvoltages. Also activated is an internal feedback channel \nwhich brings the FAULT output low for the purpose of \nnotifying the micro-controller of the fault condition. See \nFigure 63.\nReset\nThe FAULT output remains low until RESET is brought \nlow. See Figure 63. While asserting the RESET pin (LOW), \nthe input pins must be asserted for an output low state \n(VIN+ is LOW or V IN- is HIGH). This may be accomplished \neither by software control (i.e. of the microcontroller) or \nhardware control (see Figures 73 and 74).\nHCPL-316J fig 63VOUTVDESATVIN+\nFAULT\nRESETNORMAL□\nOPERATIONFAULT□\nCONDITIONRESET\nVIN+VIN-\nVIN-5 V0 V\n5 V\n5 V\n7 VNON-INVERTING□\nCONFIGURED□\nINPUTS\nINVERTING□\nCONFIGURED□\nINPUTS+□\n–+□\n–100 pF\nDDESAT\n0.1□\nµF16\n1514\n13\n12\n1110\n 91\n23\n4\n5\n67\n8V\nE\nVLED2+\nDESAT\nVCC2\nVC\nVOUT\nVEE\nVEEVIN+\nVIN-\nVCC1\nGND1\nRESET\nFAULT\nVLED1+\nVLED1-HCPL-316J\n+□\n–µC\n3.3□\n□Ω0.1□\nµF5 V\n330 pFR□VCC2 □ 18 V\nVEE □ -5 V47□\n□Ω3-PHASE□\nOUTPUT0.1□\nµF0.1□\nµF\nVF+–\n□1\n□2VCE+\n–\nVCE+–100 Ω\n22Slow IGBT Gate Discharge During Fault Condition\nWhen a desaturation fault is detected, a weak pull-down \ndevice in the HCPL-316J output drive stage will turn on \nto ‘softly’ turn off the IGBT. This device slowly discharges \nthe IGBT gate to prevent fast changes in drain current \nthat could cause damaging voltage spikes due to lead \nand wire inductance. During the slow turn off, the large \noutput pull-down device remains off until the output \nvoltage falls below V EE + 2 Volts, at which time the large \npull down device clamps the IGBT gate to V EE.\nDESAT Fault Detection Blanking Time\nThe DESAT fault detection circuitry must remain disabled \nfor a short time period following the turn-on of the IGBT \nto allow the collector voltage to fall below the DESAT \ntheshold. This time period, called the DESAT blanking \ntime, is controlled by the internal DESAT charge current, \nthe DESAT voltage threshold, and the external DESAT ca -\npacitor. The nominal blanking time is calculated in terms \nof external capacitance (C BLANK ), FAULT threshold volt -\nage (V DESAT ), and DESAT charge current (I CHG) as t BLANK  \n= C BLANK  x V DESAT  / ICHG. The nominal blanking time \nwith the recommended 100 pF capacitor is 100 pF * 7 V \n/ 250 µA = 2.8 µsec. The capacitance value can be scaled \nslightly to adjust the blanking time, though a value small -\ner than 100 pF is not recommended. This nominal blank -\ning time also represents the longest time it will take for \nthe HCPL-316J to respond to a DESAT fault condition. If \nthe IGBT is turned on while the collector and emitter are \nshorted to the supply rails (switching into a short), the \nsoft shut-down sequence will begin after approximately \n3 µsec. If the IGBT collector and emitter are shorted to \nthe supply rails after the IGBT is already on , the response \ntime will be much quicker due to the parasitic parallel \ncapacitance of the DESAT diode. The recommended 100 \npF capacitor should provide adequate blanking as well \nas fault response times for most applications.Under Voltage Lockout\nThe HCPL-316J Under Voltage Lockout (UVLO) feature is \ndesigned to prevent the application of insufficient gate \nvoltage to the IGBT by forcing the HCPL-316J output low \nduring power-up. IGBTs typically require gate voltages \nof 15 V to achieve their rated V CE(ON)  voltage. At gate \nvoltages below 13 V typically, their on-voltage increases \ndramatically, especially at higher currents. At very low \ngate voltages (below 10 V), the IGBT may operate in the \nlinear region and quickly overheat. The UVLO function \ncauses the output to be clamped whenever insufficient \noperating supply (V CC2) is applied. Once V CC2 exceeds \nVUVLO+  (the positive-going UVLO threshold), the UVLO \nclamp is released to allow the device output to turn on \nin response to input signals. As V CC2 is increased from 0 V \n(at some level below  VUVLO+ ), first the DESAT protection \ncircuitry becomes active. As V CC2 is further increased \n(above V UVLO+ ), the UVLO clamp is released. Before the \ntime the UVLO clamp is released, the DESAT protection \nis already active. Therefore, the UVLO and DESAT FAULT \nDETECTION features work together to provide seamless \nprotection regardless of supply voltage (V CC2).\n23Behavioral Circuit Schematic\nThe functional behavior of the HCPL-316J is rep -\nresented by the logic diagram in Figure 64 \nwhich fully describes the interaction and se -\nquence of internal and external signals in the  \nHCPL-316J.\nInput IC  \nIn the normal switching mode, no output fault has been \ndetected, and the low state of the fault latch allows the \ninput signals to control the signal LED. The fault output \nis in the open- collector state, and the state of the Reset \npin does not affect the control of the IGBT gate. When a \nfault is detected, the FAULT output and signal input are \nboth latched. The fault output changes to an active low \nstate, and the signal LED is forced off (output LOW). The \nlatched condition will persist until the Reset pin is pulled \nlow.\nFigure 64. Behavioral circuit schematic.Output IC  \nThree internal signals control the state of the driver out -\nput: the state of the signal LED, as well as the UVLO and \nFault signals. If no fault on the IGBT collector is detected, \nand the supply voltage is above the UVLO threshold, \nthe LED signal will control the driver output state. The \ndriver stage logic includes an interlock to ensure that the \npull-up and pull-down devices in the output stage are \nnever on at the same time. If an undervoltage condition \nis detected, the output will be actively pulled low by the \n50x DMOS device, regardless of the LED state. If an IGBT \ndesaturation fault is detected while the signal LED is on, \nthe Fault signal will latch in the high state. The triple dar -\nlington AND the 50x DMOS device are disabled, and a \nsmaller 1x DMOS pull- down device is activated to slowly \ndischarge the IGBT gate. When the output drops below \ntwo volts, the 50x DMOS device again turns on, clamp -\ning the IGBT gate firmly to Vee. The Fault signal remains \nlatched in the high state until the signal LED turns off.\nVIN+ (1)\nVIN– (2)\nVCC1 (3)\nGND (4)\nFAULT (6)\nRESET (5)DELAY\nRSQ\nFAULTLED\n12 V +–VCC2 (13)7 V –+DESAT (14)VE (16) 250 µA\nVC (12)\nV□UT (11)\nVEE (□□10)50 □\n1 □\n□C□L□316□ □□□ 64FAULTUVL□\n24Other Recommended Components\nThe application circuit in Figure 62 includes an output \npull-down resistor, a DESAT pin protection resistor, a \nFAULT pin capacitor (330 pF), and a FAULT pin pull-up \nresistor.\nOutput Pull-Down Resistor\nDuring the output high transition, the output voltage \nrapidly rises to within 3 diode drops of V CC2. If the output \ncurrent then drops to zero due to a capacitive load, the \noutput voltage will slowly rise from roughly V CC2-3(V BE) \nto V CC2 within a period of several microseconds. To limit \nthe output voltage to V CC2-3(V BE), a pull-down resistor \nbetween the output and V EE is recommended to sink a \nstatic current of several 650 µA while the output is high. \nPull-down resistor values are dependent on the amount \nof positive supply and can be adjusted according to the \nformula, R pull-down  = [V CC2-3 * (V BE)] / 650 µA.\nDESAT Pin Protection\nThe freewheeling of flyback diodes connected across \nthe IGBTs can have large instantaneous forward voltage \ntransients which greatly exceed the nominal forward \nvoltage of the diode. This may result in a large negative \nvoltage spike on the DESAT pin which will draw substan -\ntial current out of the IC if protection is not used. To limit \nthis current to levels that will not damage the IC, a 100 \nohm resistor should be inserted in series with the DE -\nSAT diode. The added resistance will not alter the DESAT \nthreshold or the DESAT blanking time.Capacitor on FAULT Pin for High CMR\nRapid common mode transients can affect the fault \npin voltage while the fault output is in the high state. A \n330 pF capacitor (Fig. 66) should be connected between \nthe fault pin and ground to achieve adequate CMOS \nnoise margins at the specified CMR value of 15 kV/µs. \nThe added capacitance does not increase the fault out -\nput delay when a desaturation condition is detected.\nPull-up Resistor on FAULT Pin\nThe FAULT pin is an open-collector output and therefore \nrequires a pull-up resistor to provide a high-level signal.\nDriving with Standard CMOS/TTL for High CMR\nCapacitive coupling from the isolated high voltage \ncircuitry to the input referred circuitry is the primary \nCMR limitation. This coupling must be accounted for to \nachieve high CMR perform ance. The input pins V IN+ and \nVIN- must have active drive signals to prevent unwanted \nswitching of the output under extreme common mode \ntransient conditions. Input drive circuits that use pull-up \nor pull-down resistors, such as open collector configu -\nrations, should be avoided. Standard CMOS or TTL drive \ncircuits are recommended.Figure 65.

The \nHCPL -316J has both inverting and non inverting gate \ncontrol inputs, an open collector fault output suitable \nfor wired ‘OR’ applications and an active low reset input.\nDriving Input pf HCPL-316J in Non-Inverting/Inverting \nMode\nThe Gate Drive Voltage Output of the HCPL -316J can \nbe configured as inverting or non-inverting using the \nVIN– and V IN+ inputs. As shown in Figure 68, when a \nnon-inverting configuration is desired, V IN– is held low \nby connecting it to GND1 and V IN+ is toggled. As shown \nin Figure 69, when an inverting configuration is desired, \nVIN+ is held high by connecting it to V CC1 and V IN– is tog -\ngled.\nLocal Shutdown, Local Reset\nAs shown in Figure 70, the fault output of each HCPL-\n316J gate driver is polled separately, and the individual \nreset lines are asserted low independently to reset the \nmotor controller after a fault condition. \nGlobal-Shutdown, Global Reset \nAs shown in Figure 71, when configured for inverting op -\neration, the HCPL-316J can be configured to shutdown \nautomatically in the event of a fault condition by tying \nthe FAULT output to V IN+. For high reliability drives, the \nopen collector FAULT outputs of each HCPL-316J can be \nwire ‘OR’ed together on a common fault bus, forming a \nsingle fault bus for interfacing directly to the micro-con -\ntroller. When any of the six gate drivers detects a fault, \nthe fault output signal will disable all six HCPL-316J gate \ndrivers simultaneously and thereby provide protection \nagainst further catastrophic failures.Figure 68.

Global-shutdown, global reset configuration.Figure 72. Auto-reset configuration.Auto-Reset\nAs shown in Figure 72, when the inverting V IN- input is \nconnected to ground (non-inverting configuration), the \nHCPL -316J can be configured to reset automatically by \nconnecting RESET to V IN+. In this case, the gate control \nsignal is applied to the non-inverting input as well as the \nreset input to reset the fault latch every switching cycle. \nDuring normal operation of the IGBT, asserting the reset \ninput low has no effect. Following a fault condition, the \ngate driver remains in the latched fault state until the \ngate control signal changes to the ‘gate low’ state and \nresets the fault latch. If the gate control signal is a con -\ntinuous PWM signal, the fault latch will always be reset \nby the next time the input signal goes high. This config -\nuration protects the IGBT on a cycle -by-cycle basis and \nautomatically resets before the next ‘on’ cycle. The fault \noutputs can be wire ‘OR’ed together to alert the micro -\ncontroller, but this signal would not be used for control \npurposes in this (Auto -Reset) configuration. When the \nHCPL - 316J is configured for Auto -Reset, the guaranteed \nminimum FAULT signal pulse width is 3 µs.\nFigure 73a. Safe hardware reset for noninverting input \nconfiguration (automatically resets for every V IN+ input).Figure 73b. Safe hardware reset for noninverting input \nconfiguration.Resetting Following a Fault Condition\nTo resume normal switching operation following a fault \ncondition (FAULT output low), the RESET pin must first \nbe asserted low in order to release the internal fault \nlatch and reset the FAULT output (high). Prior to assert -\ning the RESET pin low, the input (V IN) switching signals \nmust be configured for an output (V OL) low state. This \ncan be handled directly by the microcontroller or by \nhardwiring to synchronize the RESET signal with the ap -\npropriate input signal. Figure 73a shows how to connect \nthe RESET to the V IN+ signal for safe automatic reset in \nthe noninverting input configuration. Figure 73b shows \nhow to configure the V IN+/RESET signals so that a RESET \nsignal from the microcontroller causes the input to be \nin the “output-off” state. Similarly, Figures 73c and 73d \nshow automatic RESET and microcontroller RESET safe \nconfigurations for the inverting input configuration.\nHCPL-316J fig 711\n2\n3\n4\n5\n678V\nIN+\nVIN-\nVCC1\nGND1\nRESET\nFAULT\nVLED1+\nVLED1-HCPL-316J\n+\n–µC\nCONNECT\nTO OTHER\nFAULTSCONNECT\nTO OTHER\nRESETS\nHCPL-316J fig 721\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8V\nIN+\nVIN-\nVCC1\nGND1\nRESET\nFAULTV\nLED1+\nVLED1-HCPL-316J\n+\n–µC\n1\n23\n4\n5\n678V\nIN+\nVIN-\nVCC1\nGND1\nRESET\nFAULTV\nLED1+\nVLED1-HCPL-316J\nµCVCC\nVIN+/\nRESET\nFAULT1\n23\n4\n5\n678V\nIN+\nVIN-\nVCC1\nGND1\nRESET\nFAULTV\nLED1+\nVLED1-HCPL-316J\nµCVCC\nRESET\nFAULTVIN+\n270.5 A, the value of R C can be estimated in the following \nway:\nRC + RG = [VCC2 – V OH – (VEE)]\n                            IOH,PEAK\n               = [4 V – (-5 V)]\n                         0.5 A\n               = 18 Ω\n          RC = 8 Ω \nSee “Power and Layout Considerations” section for more \ninformation on calculating value of R G.User-Configuration of the HCPL-316J Output Side R G \nand Optional Resistor R C:\nThe value of the gate resistor R G (along with V CC2 and V EE) \ndetermines the maximum amount of gate-charging/dis -\ncharging current (I ON,PEAK  and I OFF,PEAK ) and thus should \nbe carefully chosen to match the size of the IGBT being \ndriven. Often it is desirable to have the peak gate charge \ncurrent be somewhat less than the peak discharge cur -\nrent (I ON,PEAK  < I OFF,PEAK ). For this condition, an optional \nresistor (R C) can be used along with R G to independently \ndetermine I ON,PEAK  and I OFF,PEAK  without using a steering \ndiode.

Current buffer for increased drive current.\nPower/Layout Considerations\nOperating Within the Maximum Allowable Power Ratings  \n(Adjusting Value of R G):\nWhen choosing the value of R G, it is important to con -\nfirm that the power dissipation of the HCPL -316J is \nwithin the maximum allowable power rating.\nThe steps for doing this are:\n1. Calculate the minimum desired R G;Higher Output Current Using an External Current Buf -\nfer:\nTo increase the IGBT gate drive current, a non-inverting \ncurrent buffer (such as the npn/pnp buffer shown in \nFigure 75) may be used. Inverting types are not com -\npatible with the desatura-tion fault protection circuitry \nand should be avoided. To preserve the slow IGBT turn-\noff feature during a fault condition, a 10 nF capacitor \nshould be connected from the buffer input to V EE and \na 10 W resistor inserted between the output and the \ncommon npn/pnp base. The MJD44H11/MJD45H11 \npair is appropriate for currents up to 8A maximum. The \nD44VH10/ D45VH10 pair is appropriate for currents up \nto 15 A maximum.DESAT Diode and DESAT Threshold\nThe DESAT diode’s function is to conduct forward cur -\nrent, allowing sensing of the IGBT’s saturated collector-\nto-emitter voltage, V CESAT , (when the IGBT is “on”) and to \nblock high voltages (when the IGBT is “off”). During the \nshort period of time when the IGBT is switching, there is \ncommonly a very high dV CE/dt voltage ramp rate across \nthe IGBT’s collector-to-emitter. This results in I CHARGE  (= \nCD-DESAT  x dV CE/dt) charging current which will charge \nthe blanking capacitor, C BLANK . In order to minimize \nthis charging current and avoid false DESAT triggering, \nit is best to use fast response diodes. Listed in the be -\nlow table are fast-recovery diodes that are suitable for \nuse as a DESAT diode (D DESAT ). In the recommended ap -\nplication circuit shown in Figure 62, the voltage on pin \n14 (DESAT) is V DESAT  = V F + V CE, (where V F is the forward \nON voltage of D DESAT  and V CE is the IGBT collector-to-\nemitter voltage). The value of V CE which triggers DESAT \nto signal a FAULT condition, is nominally 7V – V F. If de -\nsired, this DESAT threshold voltage can be decreased by \nusing multiple DESAT diodes in series. If n is the number \nof DESAT diodes then the nominal threshold value be -\ncomes V CE,FAULT(TH)  = 7 V – n x V F. In the case of using two \ndiodes instead of one, diodes with half of the total re -\nquired maximum reverse-voltage rating may be chosen.16\n1514\n13\n12\n11\n10\n 9V\nE\nVLED2+\nDESAT\nVCC2\nVC\nVOUT\nVEE\nVEE10 ΩHCPL-316J \n100 pF\n10 nFMJD44H11 or□\n      D44VH10\n4.5 Ω\n2.5 Ω\nMJD45H11 or□\n      D45VH10\n15 V -5 V\n2.

This value may increase or  \ndecrease by a factor of 2 depending on PCB layout and/or airflow.Thermal Model\nThe HCPL-316J is designed to dissipate the majority of \nthe heat through pins 4 for the input IC and pins 9 and 10 \nfor the output IC. (There are two V EE pins on the output \nside, pins 9 and 10, for this purpose.) Heat flow through \nother pins or through the package directly into ambient \nare considered negligible and not modeled here.\nIn order to achieve the power dissipation specified in \nthe absolute maximum specification, it is imperative \nthat pins 4, 9, and 10 have ground planes connected to \nthem. As long as the maximum power specification is \nnot exceeded, the only other limita  tion to the amount \nof power one can dissipate is the absolute maximum \njunction temperature specification of 125°C. The junc -\ntion temperatures can be calculated with the following \nequations:\nTji = P i (qi4 + q4A) + T A\nTjo = P o (qo9,10  + q9,10A ) + T A\nwhere P i = power into input IC and P o = power into out -\nput IC. Since q4A and q9,10A  are dependent on PCB layout \nand airflow, their exact number may not be available. \nTherefore, a more accurate method of calcu lat ing the \njunction temperature is with the following equations:\nTji = P iqi4 + T P4\nTjo = P oqo9,10  + T P9,10\nThese equations, however, require that the pin 4 and pins \n9, 10 temperatures be measured with a thermal couple \non the pin at the HCPL-316J package edge.From the earlier power dissipation calculation example:\nPi = 90.8 mW, P o = 217.3 mW, T A = 100°C, and assuming \nthe thermal model shown in Figure 77 below.\nTji = (90.8 mW)(60°C/W + 50°C/W) + 100°C\n  = 110°C\nTjo = (217.3 mW)(30°C/W + 50°C/W) + 100°C \n = 117°C\nboth of which are within the absolute maximum specifi -\ncation of 125°C.\nIf we, however, assume a worst case PCB layout and no \nair flow where the estimated q4A and q9,10A  are 100°C/W. \nThen the junction temperatures become\nTji = (90.8 mW)(60°C/W + 100°C/W) + 100°C\n = 115°C\nTjo = (217.3 mW)(30°C/W + 100°C/W) + 100°C \n = 128°C\nThe output IC junction temperature exceeds the abso -\nlute maximum specification of 125°C. In this case, PCB \nlayout and airflow will need to be designed so that the \njunction temperature of the output IC does not exceed \n125°C.\nIf the calculated junction temperatures for the thermal \nmodel in Figure 78 is higher than 125°C, the pin temper -\nature for pins 9 and 10 should be measured (at the pack -\nage edge) under worst case operating environment for a \nmore accurate estimate of the junction temperatures.\nHCPL-316J fig 78TP4 TP9,10\nθ4A = 50°C/W* θ9,10A  = 50°C/W*\nTAθi4 = 60°C/W θO9,10  = 30°C/WTji Tjo□\n□\n31Printed Circuit Board Layout Considerations\nAdequate spacing should always be maintained be -\ntween the high voltage isolated circuitry and any input \nreferenced circuitry. Care must be taken to provide the \nsame minimum spacing between two adjacent high-side \nisolated regions of the printed circuit board. Insufficient \nspacing will reduce the effective isolation and increase \nparasitic coupling that will degrade CMR performance.\nThe placement and routing of supply bypass capacitors \nrequires special attention. During switch ing transients, \nthe majority of the gate charge is supplied by the bypass \ncapacitors. Maintaining short bypass capacitor trace \nlengths will ensure low supply ripple and clean switch -\ning waveforms.Ground Plane connections are necessary for pin 4 (GND1) \nand pins 9 and 10 (V EE) in order to achieve maximum \npower dissipation as the HCPL-316J is designed to dissi -\npate the majority of heat generated through these pins. \nActual power dissipation will depend on the application \nenvironment (PCB layout, air flow, part placement, etc.) \nSee the Thermal Model section for details on how to es -\ntimate junction temperature.\nThe layout examples below have good supply bypassing \nand thermal properties, exhibit small PCB footprints, and \nhave easily connected signal and supply lines. The four \nexamples cover single sided and double sided compo -\nnent placement, as well as minimal and improved per -\nformance circuits.\nFigure 79.

Waveforms for Dead Time Calculation.System Considerations\nPropagation Delay Difference (PDD)\nThe HCPL-316J includes a Propagation Delay Difference \n(PDD) specification intended to help designers minimize \n“dead time” in their power inverter designs. Dead time \nis the time period during which both the high and low \nside power transistors (Q1 and Q2 in Figure 62) are off. \nAny overlap in Q1 and Q2 conduction will result in large \ncurrents flowing through the power devices between \nthe high and low voltage motor rails, a potentially cata -\nstrophic condi tion that must be prevented.\nTo minimize dead time in a given design, the turn-on of \nthe HCPL-316J driving Q2 should be delayed (relative to \nthe turn-off of the HCPL-316J driving Q1) so that under \nworst-case conditions, transistor Q1 has just turned off  \nwhen transistor Q2 turns on, as shown in Figure 80. The \namount of delay necessary to achieve this condition is \nequal to the maxi mum value of the propagation delay \ndifference specification, PDD MAX, which is specified to \nbe 400 ns over the operating temperature range of -40°C \nto 100°C.Delaying the HCPL-316J turn-on signals by the maximum \npropaga  tion delay difference ensures that the minimum \ndead time is zero, but it does not tell a designer what the \nmaximum dead time will be. The maximum dead time is \nequivalent to the difference between the maximum and \nminimum propagation delay difference specifications \nas shown in Figure 81. The maximum dead time for the \nHCPL-316J is 800 ns (= 400 ns - (-400 ns)) over an operat -\ning temperature range of  -40°C to 100°C. \nNote that the propagation delays used to calculate PDD \nand dead time are taken at equal tempera  tures and test \nconditions since the optocouplers under consider  a tion \nare typically mounted in close proximity to each other \nand are switching identical IGBTs.\ntPHLMAX\ntPLHMIN\nPDD* MAX = (t PHL- tPLH)MAX  = tPHLMAX  - tPLHMIN\n*PDD = PROPAGATION DELAY\nNOTE:  FOR PDD CALCULATIONS THE PROPAGATION DELAYSARE TAKEN AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE AND TEST CONDITIONS.V\nOUT1\nVIN+2VOUT2VIN+1\nQ1 ON\nQ2 OFFQ1 OFF\nQ2 ONtPLHMIN\nMAXIMUM DEAD TIME(DUE TO OPTOCOUPLER)\n= (t\nPHLMAX  - tPHLMIN) + (t PLHMAX  - tPLHMIN)\n= (tPHLMAX  - tPLHMIN) – (t PHLMIN - tPLHMAX)\n= PDD* MAX – PDD* MIN \n*PDD = PROPAGATION DELAY DIFFERENCE\nNOTE:  FOR DEAD TIME AND PDD CALCULATIONS ALL PROPAGATIONDELAYS ARE TAKEN AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE AND TEST CONDITIONS.V\nOUT1\nVIN+2VOUT2VIN+1\nQ1 ON\nQ2 OFFQ1 OFF\nQ2 ON\ntPHLMIN\ntPHLMAX\ntPLHMAX\n= PDD* MAX (tPHL- tPLH)MAX\nMouser Electronics\n  \nAuthorized Distributor\n \n  \nClick to View Pricing, Inventory, Delivery & Lifecycle Information:\n \n \n \n Broadcom Limited:   \n\xa0 HCPL-316J\xa0 HCPL-316J#500\xa0 HCPL-316J-000E\xa0 HCPL-316J-500E\n'}]
