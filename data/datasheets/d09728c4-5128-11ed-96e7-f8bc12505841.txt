The CMD signal \nhas two operating modes: open -drain for initialization, and \npush -pull for command transfer. Commands are sent from \nthe MMC bus master to the device, and responses are sent \nfrom the device to the host.  \nA3,A4,A5,B2,B3,B4,B\n5,B6  DAT0 ~\nDAT7  I/O Data I/O:  \nThese are bidirectional data signals. The DAT signals operate \nin push -pull mode. By default, after power -up or assertion of \nthe RST_n signal, only DAT0 is used for data transfer. The \nMMC controller can configure a wider data bus for data \ntransfer using eit her DAT[3:0] (4 -bit mode) or DAT[7:0] (8 -bit \nmode).eMMC includes internal pull -up resistors for data \nlines DAT[7:1]. Immediately after entering the 4 -bit mode, \nthe device disconnects the internal pull -up resistors on the \nDAT[3:1] lines. Correspondingly, im mediately after entering \nthe 8 -bit mode, the device disconnects the internal pull -ups \non the DAT[7:1] lines.  \nK5 RST_n  Input  Reset.  \nThe RST_n  signal is used for host resetting device, moving \nthe device to pre -idle state. By default, the RST_n signal is \ntemporary disabled in device. The host must set bits[1:0] in \nthe extended CSD register [162] to 0x1 to enable this \nfunctionality before the host  can use it.  \nE6, F5, J10, K9  VCC Supply  NAND interface I/O and NAND Flash power supply.  \nC6, M4, N4, P3, P5  VCCQ  Supply  eMMC controller core and eMMC interface I/O power \nsupply.  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nPAGE 15 OF 45  \nCopyright © 2018 by  Jiangsu Huacun Electronic Technology Co.

Mentor Series S upported Features  \n11.1 Bootable  \nHuancun  F1DA17DA datasheet  supports boot operatio n modes accordingly to eMMC  interface definition as \nspecified by JEDEC ○R. \n \n11.1.1  Timing for Boot Operation  \nThe following diagram show Multimedia Card state and timing diagram for normal boot mode. The \noperation detail for the boot operation is described as following.  \nIf the CMD line is held LOW for 74 clock cycles and more after power -up or reset (no matter th rough CMD0 \nwith the argument of 0xF0F0F0F0 or assertion of hardware reset for eMMC , If it is enabled in Extended CSD \nregister byte [162], bits [1:0]) before the first command is issued, the boot data will be prepared internally \nby the slave once it recogni zes that the boot mode is being initiated. The partition from which the master \nwill read the boot data can be selected in advance by using EXT_CSD byte [179], bits [5:3]. The data size \n128KB xBOOT_SIZE_MULT (EXT_CSD byte [226]). After the CMD line goes low  and within 1 second, the \nslave starts to send the first boot data to the master on the DAT line (s). The CMD line must be kept LOW by \nthe master to read all of the boot data. The push -pull mode must be used by the master until boot \noperation is terminated . The master can choose to use single data rate mode with backward -compatible \ninterface timing, single data rate with high -speed interface timing or dual data rate timing (if it supported). \nThe master can choose to receive boot acknowledge from the slave b y setting “1” in EXIT_CSD register, byte \n[179], bit6. And then the master recognizes that the slave is operating in boot mode. The slave has to send \nacknowledge pattern “010” to the master within 50ms after the CMD goes low if boot acknowledge is \nenabled. The acknowledge pattern “0 -1-0” will not be sent out by the slave if boot acknowledge is disabled. \nThe boot mode can be terminated by the master with the CMD line is High. If the CMD line is pulled High \nby the master in the middle of data transfer, the sla ve has to terminate the data transfer or acknowledge \npattern within NST clock cycles (one data cycle and end bit cycle). If the boot mode is terminated by the \nmaster between consecutive blocks, the slave must release the data line(s) within NST clock cycle s.  \nWhen all contents of the enabled boot data are sent to the master, boot operation will be terminated. After \nboot operation is executed, the slave shall be ready for CMD1 operation and the master needs to start a \nnormal MMC initialization sequence by sendin g CMD1. From CMD signal high to next MMC command, it \nneeds minimum 8 clocks + 48 clocks = 56 clocks. Before CMD1 is issued, if the CMD line is held LOW for less \nthan 74 clock cycles after power -up or the master sends any normal MMC command other than CMD0 with \nargument 0xFFFFFFFA before initiating boot mode, the slave shall not respond and shall be locked out of \nboot mode until the next power cycle or hardware reset, and shall enter Idle State. Slave must enter Card \nIdentification Mode and respond to the co mmand when BOOT_PARTITION_ENABLE bits are set and master \nsend CMD1 (SEND_OP_COND). If the boot operation mode is not supported by the slave that is compliant \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nPAGE 18 OF 45  \nCopyright © 2018 by  Jiangsu Huacun Electronic Technology Co. Ltd.

Device that is compliant with v4.4 standard \nwill show “1” bit 0 in the Extended CS D byte [228]. The slave will recognize that boot mode is being \ninitiated and starts preparing boot data internally, if the host issues CMD0 with the argument of \n0xFFFFFFFA after 74 clock cycles before CMD1 is issued or the CMD line goes low when the device  is \npowered -up or reset (either assertion of CMD0 with the argument of 0xF0F0F0F0 or H/W reset if it is \nenabled). The partition from which the master will read the boot data can be selected in advance using \nEXT_CSD byte [179], bits [5:3]. 128KB xBOOT_SIZE_ MULT (EXT_CSD byte [226] is the data size that the \nmaster can read during boot operation. The slave starts to send the first boot data to the master on the \nDAT line(s) within 1 second after CMD with the argument of 0xFFFFFFFA is issued within 1 second. The  \nmaster must use push -pull mode until boot operation is terminated. The master can choose to use single \ndata rate with high -speed interface timing or dual rate timing (if it is supported), single data rate mode with \nbackward -compatible interface timing. Th e master can choose to receive boot acknowledge from the slave \nby setting “1” in EXT_CSD register, byte [179], bit 6 that the master can recognize that the slave is operating \nin boot mode.  \nThe acknowledge pattern “010” must be sent to the master within 50 ms by the slave after the CMD0 with \nthe argument of 0xFFFFFFFA is received for the condition if boot acknowledge is enabled. If boot \nacknowledge is disabled, the acknowledge pattern “010” will not be sent out by the slave. When all \ncontents of the enabled boot data are sent to the master, boot operation will be terminated.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nPAGE 19 OF 45  \nCopyright © 2018 by  Jiangsu Huacun Electronic Technology Co.

Memory blocks are segmented as hereafter:  \n⚫ Defau lt factory setting defines two 4  MB boot partitions, as enhanced storage media.  \nHost can set one segment in User Data Area as enhanced storage media (starting location and Write \nProtect Group size). This is one -time programmable and can NOT be changed once set.  \nUp to 4 General Purpose Area can be set as user data or sensitive data or other usage. Partition size must \nbe a multiple of the write protect group. This is one -time programmable and can NOT be changed once set.  \nThere are four default area existed in the memory device including a  User Data Area, two possible boot \narea partitions for booting and the Replay Protected Area Partition to verify and replay -protect data. Before \nany partitioning operation, the memory initially consists of the User Data Area and Boot Area Partitions. \nThe e mbedded device offers the possibility of configuring by using host additional split local memory \npartition with independent addressable space. The addressable space starts from logical address \n0x00000000 for different usage models. For two Boot Area Partit ions, the size is multiple of 128KB and let \nthe booting from eMMC  can be performed. Four General Purpose Area Partitions is used for sensitive data \nstorage and the size is multiple of a Write Protect Group. Memory manufacturer defines Boot Partitions’ \nsize and attributes (read -only). For General Purpose Area Partitions’ sizes and attributes, they can be \nprogrammed by the host only once in the device life cycle (one -time programmable). Moreover, one \nsegment of the User Data Area can be configured to be imple mented as enhanced storage media and to \nspecify its starting location and size in terms of Write Protect Groups. The attributes of the Enhanced User \nData Area can be programmed only once during device life cycle. The memory block area can be divided \nand ex ample of partitions and user data area configuration are shown as following.  \n \n \nFigure 7 eMMC Memory Organization    \n\n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nPAGE 21 OF 45  \nCopyright © 2018 by  Jiangsu Huacun Electronic Technology Co.

Typical sleep transition last 200ns (highest duration before sleep is 850ms, for \nhousekeeping operation). It does not involve any action from host, however, for maximu m power saving \n(lowest current), host clock to the memory device needs to be shut down. For most embedded systems, \nbeside while host is accessing data, devices are always in sleep mode, for greater power saving efficiency. \nWhenever host is going to access storage device in sleep mode, any issued command will cause device to \nexit sleep and operation execution.  \n\n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nPAGE 22 OF 45  \nCopyright © 2018 by  Jiangsu Huacun Electronic Technology Co.

Any other command will be completely ignored.  \nThe Vcc power supply may even be switched off in Sleep mode to allow further power saving.  \nFor additional i nformation please r efer JESD84 -B51 6.6.2 1.  \n \n11.5 Enhanced Write  \nIn Huancun  F1DA17DA datasheet  reliable write mode, original data pointed by a logical address will stay \nthe same until the new data has been successfully overwritten. This ensures that the each write transaction \nwill always be reliable and never leaves undefined data in given address. When using enhanced write, data \nwill remain valid even in the case of power drop during programming.  \n \n11.6 Secure Erase  \nHuancun  F1DA17DA datasheet  supports Security Mode Erase command. Once triggered, no command is \nallowed until Secure Erase is completed.  \nHuancun  F1DA17DA datasheet  will sanitize the erase area with predefined pattern. The purge will \noverwrite addressable content with a given char acter and then erase the NAND flash.  \nThis command meets specific defense or governmental requirements and guarantees Flash memory \ncontent can no longer be restored.  \n \n11.7 Secure Trim  \nHuancun  F1DA17DA datasheet  Secure Trim is similar to the Secure Erase but performs a purge on write \nblocks (512 bytes) .  \n \n11.8 Trim  \nTrim function acts like an Erase but operate at block (512 B) level. For additional informa tion, refer to \nJEDEC ○R JESD84 -B51 6.6.10  \n \n \n11.9 Write P rotection  \nTo prevent accidental data loss or overwrite, Huancun  F1DA17DA datasheet  provides two levels of write \nprotection:  \n• Write -protect the whole device (including the Boot Area Partitions, General Purpose Area Partition, \nand User/Enhanced User Data Area Partition) by setting the permanent or temporary write protect bits in \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nPAGE 23 OF 45  \nCopyright © 2018 by  Jiangsu Huacun Electronic Technology Co.

Segment size can be \ndefined in the EXT_CSD register.  \nFor additional information, refer to JEDEC ○R JESD84 -B51 6.6.15 . \n \n11.10  Hardware Reset  \nHost may reset the device to pre -idle state and disable temporary write protection on related blocks. For \nadditional information, refer to JEDEC ○R JESD84 -B51 6.15.10 . \n \n11.11  Background Operations  \nIn order to reduce latency for time critical operations, housekeeping operations (garbage collection, erase \nand compaction) are executed in the background.  \nOperations are classified into two types:  \nForeground – such as read or write commands and  \nBackground –executed when the device is not busy with host commands.  \nFor additional information on Background Operations, refer to JESD84 -B51 standard  6.6.2 5.  \n \n11.12  High Priority Interrupt (HPI)  \nIf OS use on demand -paging to run user process, the host needs to fetch pages in the midst of other \noperation, so the query might be delayed until the completion of the command.  \nHigh priority interrupt (HPI) allows low read latency operation, by holding lower priority process before \ncompletion. This mechanism reduces latency, typically to less than 10 ms.  \nFor additional information on the HPI function, refer to JESD84 -B51 standar d 6.6.2 6.  \n \n \n \n \n \n11.13  HS400 \nHuancun  F1DA17DA datasheet  eMMC  supports the HS 4 00 mode operation which can en hance the transfer \nspeed up to 400 MB/s with up to 4 00 MHz frequency by 1.8V supply voltages.  \nAfter the F1DA17DA datasheet  is triggered by the host, the host will read the DEVICE_TYPE field in the \nExtended CSD register to see whether F1DA17DA datasheet  is HS4 00 mode supported or not..  For more \ninformation on the HS4 00 mode, refer to JESD84 -B51 standard  5.3.6 .

The Discard operation is similar to TRIM. After discard \noperation, the data will be partially or fully remained according to different device. The contents of \ndiscarded write block will be decided by th e device.  \nFor Discard, if the data is marked for erase, it is no need for the device to guarantee that the host would not \nretrieve the original data from those “marked” logical block address when a Read operation is directed. \nHowever, for TRIM operation, it must response with ‘0’ or ‘1’ depends on different memory technology.  \nFor additional information on the Discard, please refer to JESD84 -B51 standard  6.6.1 2  \n \n11.15   Sanitize  \nThe Sanitize operation is a feature that is used to remove data from the device in addition to TRIM and \nErase. The Sanitize operation is to physically remove the data from the unmapped user address space in the \ndevice. For initializing a Sanitize operation, it is needed to write a value to the extended CSD [165] \nSANITIZE_START. While the  device is performing the sanitize operation, the busy line is asserted, the busy \nline is asserted. The Sanitize operation will be continued with busy asserted until one of the following \nevents occurs:  \n• Sanitize operation is complete.  \n• An HPI is used to abor t the operation  \n• A power failure . \n• A hardware reset. For additional information on the Sanitize, refer to JESD84 -B51 standard 6.6.1 1. \n \n11.16  Extended partition types  \nEach General Purpose partition has a different extended partition attribute. The list of attribute  types \nincludes as following:  \n• Default: no extended attribute is set  \n• System code: a partition that is rarely updated and contains important system files (e.g. containing the \nexecutable files of the host operating system)  \n• Non -Persistent – a partition that is  used for temporary information (e.g. swap file to extend the host \nvirtual memory space)  \nThe device can be optimized for the mixture of storage media characteristics for users per partition. The \nenhanced and extended attribute set can not be existed in a s ingle partition.  For additional information on \nthe extended  partition, refer to JESD84 -B51 6.2.3  standard  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nPAGE 26 OF 45  \nCopyright © 2018 by  Jiangsu Huacun Electronic Technology Co.

By combining a group of commands with \na single context can optimize the performance of dat a handling for the device.  \nThe context -ID defines one or more concurrent contexts that can be supported by the device. Context ID #0 \nalways exists for backward compatibility and for context -less data. For each context ID (besides #0),  there is \na configura tion field in EXT_CSD to control its behavior. For additional information on the Context ID \nManagement, refer to JESD84 -B51 standard  6.6.27. \n \n11.18  Data Tag  \nThe device can receive the specific data types (for instance file system metadata, time -stamps, \nconfigura tion parameters, etc.) from the host by the Data Tag mechanism. The address will be well defined \nand the information will be transferred before a write multiple blocks writing operation. During the read \nand update operations, the device improves the access  rate by receiving the Data Tag information. Besides, \nthe Data Tag also helps for more reliable and robust storage solution. For additional information on the \nData Tag function, refer to JESD84 -B51 standard  6.6.28  \n \n11.19  Packed Commands  \nFor reducing overheads, packed commands can be applied to pack read and write commands in one group \nand transfer it at one time on the bus. For additional information on the Packed Commands, ref er to \nJESD84 -B51 standard 6.6. 29. \n \n11.20  Real Time Clock  \nFor the host, it provides UTC based absolute time or relative time if available for the host to update real \ntime clock and relative time updates (see CMD49). The main function of the real time clock is to provide \nreal time clock information to the device for internal maint enance use. For additional information on the \nReal Time Clock, ref er to JESD84 -B51 standard 6.6.3 5. \n \n11.21  Dynamic Device Capacity  \nDynamic Device Capacity is a function to reduce the bad blocks capacity due to extensive memory usage or \naging of Flash to extend t he lifespan of the device.  \nThe dynamic device capacity commands and statuses are based on high capacity write protection group \nsize and support only for high capacity devices.  \nFor additional information on the Dynamic Devi ce Capacity, refer to JESD84 -B51 6.6.33  standard . \n \n11.22  Power Off Notification  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nPAGE 27 OF 45  \nCopyright © 2018 by  Jiangsu Huacun Electronic Technology Co.

There are two \noptions for the large sector size of high capacity devices as follows.  \n• Small 512B sectors (supported by devices up to a nd including 256GB)  \n• Large 4KB sectors (supported by all devices)  \nThe device reports its native sector size in NATIVE_SECTOR_SIZE field of EXT_CSD [63].  \nFor additional information on the Large Sector Size, ref er to JESD84 -B51 standard 6.6.3 4 \n \n11.24  Cache  \nFor an eMMC  device, cache is the temporary storage space used for reducing read/write access time \n(compared to an access to the main non -volatile storage). The cache can be used also for some special \noperations such as to be the execution memory for memory controller  or to be the address mapping table \nstorage space. For additional information on the Cache , refer to JESD84 -B51 standard 6.6.3 1. \n \n12. AC Parameter  \n  The Extended CSD register defines the Device properties and selected modes. It is 512 bytes long. The \nmost significant 320 bytes are the Properties segment, that defines the Device capabilities and cannot be \nmodified by the host.
