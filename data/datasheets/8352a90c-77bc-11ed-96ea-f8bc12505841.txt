Its on-chip precision output amplifier allows rail-to-rail \noutput swing to be achieved. The AD5300 uses a versatile 3-wire \nserial interface that operates at clock rates up to 30 MHz and is compatible with standard SPI®, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™, and \nDSP interface standards. \nThe reference for the AD5300\n1 is derived from the power supply \ninputs and thus gives the widest dynamic output range. The part \nincorporates a power-on reset circuit that ensures that the DAC \noutput powers up to 0 V and remains there until a valid write takes \nplace to the device. The part contains a power-down feature that reduces the current consumption of the device to 200 nA at 5 V and provides software selectable output loads while in power-down mode. The part is put into power-down mode over the \nserial interface. \nThe low power consumption of this part in normal operation \nmakes it ideally suited to portable battery-operated equipment. \nThe power consumption is 0.7 mW at 5 V , reducing to 1 μW in \npower-down mode. \nThe AD5300 is one of a family of pin-compatible DACs. The \nAD5310 is the 10-bit version, and the AD5320 is the 12-bit \nversion. The AD5300/AD5310/AD5320 are available in 6-lead \nSOT-23 packages and 8-lead MSOP packages. PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Available in 6-lead SOT-23 and 8-lead MSOP packages. \n2. Low power, single-supply operation. This part operates from a \nsingle 2.7 V to 5.5 V supply and typically consumes 0.35 mW \nat 3 V and 0.7 mW at 5 V , making it ideal for battery-powered \napplications. \n3. The on-chip output buffer amplifier allows the output of the DAC to swing rail-to-rail with a slew rate of 1 V/μs. \n4. Reference derived from the power supply. \n5. High speed serial interface with  clock speeds up to 30 MHz. \nDesigned for very low power consumption. The interface powers up only during a write cycle. \n6. Power-down capability. When powered down, the DAC typically consumes 50 nA at 3 V and 200 nA at 5 V . \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n1 Patent pending; protected by U.S. Patent No. 5684481. \n–2– REV.

TERMINOLOGY\nRelative Accuracy\nFor the DAC, relative accuracy or integral nonlinearity (INL) is\na measure of the maximum deviation, in LSBs, from a straight line\npassing through the endpoints of the DAC transfer function. A\ntypical INL vs. code plot can be seen in Figure 2.\nDifferential Nonlinearity\nDifferential nonlinearity (DNL) is the difference between themeasured change and the ideal 1 LSB change between any twoadjacent codes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB\nmaximum ensures monotonicity. This DAC is guaranteedmonotonic by design. A typical DNL vs. code plot can be seenin Figure 3.\nZero-Code Error\nZero-code error is a measure of the output error when zero code(00 Hex) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally, the outputshould be 0 V. The zero-code error is always positive in the\nAD5300 because the output of the DAC cannot go below 0 V.\nThis is due to a combination of the offset errors in the DACand output amplifier. Zero-code error is expressed in LSBs. A\nplot of zero-code error vs. temperature can be seen in Figure 6.\nFull-Scale Error\nFull-scale error is a measure of the output error when full-\nscale code (FF Hex) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally,\nthe output should be V DD – 1 LSB. Full-scale error is expressed\nin LSBs. A plot of full-scale error vs. temperature can be\nseen in Figure 6.Gain Error\nThis is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the devia-tion in slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from ideal\nexpressed as a percent of the full-scale range.\nTotal Unadjusted Error\nTotal unadjusted error (TUE) is a measure of the output error\ntaking into account all the various errors. A typical TUE vs.\ncode plot can be seen in Figure 4.\nZero-Code Error Drift\nThis is a measure of the change in zero-code error with a\nchange in temperature. It is expressed in µV/°C.\nGain Error Drift\nThis is a measure of the change in gain error with changes intemperature. It is expressed in (ppm of full-scale range)/ °C.\nDigital-to-Analog Glitch Impulse\nDigital-to-analog glitch impulse is the impulse injected into the\nanalog output when the input code in the DAC register changes\nstate. It is normally specified as the area of the glitch in nV-secsand is measured when the digital input code is chan ged by\n1 LSB at the major carry transition (7F Hex to 80 Hex). SeeFigure 19.\nDigital Feedthrough\nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into the\nanalog output of the DAC from the digital inputs of the DAC\nbut is measured when the DAC output is not updated. It isspecified in nV-secs and is measured with a full-scale code\nchange on the data bus, i.e., from all 0s to all 1s, and vice versa.\nD\nCODEINL ERROR – LSBs1.0\n0.5\n–1.005 0 250 100 150 2000\n–0.5INL @ 3V\nINL @ 5VTA = 25/H11543C\nFigure 2.

The archi-\ntecture consists of a string DAC followed by an output buffer\namplifier. Since there is no reference input pin, the power\nsupply (V DD) acts as the reference. Figure 20 shows a block\ndiagram of the DAC architecture.\nVDD\nVOUT\nGNDRESISTOR\nSTRINGREF (+)\nREF (–) OUTPUT\nAMPLIFIERDAC REGISTER\nFigure 20. DAC Architecture\nSince the input coding to the DAC is straight binary, the ideal\noutput voltage is given by\n    VOUT =VDD×D\n256\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nwhere D = decimal equivalent of the binary code that is loaded\nto the DAC register; D can range from 0 to 255.\nResistor String\nThe resistor string section is shown in Figure 21. It is simply a\nstring of resistors, each of value R. The code loaded to theDAC register determines at which node on the string the voltageis tapped off to be fed into the output amplifier. The voltage is\ntapped off by closing one of the switches connecting the string\nto the amplifier. Because it is a string of resistors, it is guaran-teed monotonic.\nR\nR\nTO OUTPUT\nAMPLIFIERR\nR\nR\nFigure 21. Resistor StringOutput Amplifier\nThe output buffer amplifier is capable of generating rail-to-rail\nvoltages on its output, which gives an output range of 0 V toV\nDD. It is capable of driving a load of 2 k Ω in parallel with\n1000 pF to GND. The source and sink capabilities of the outputamplifier can be seen in Figures 8 and 9. The slew rate is 1 V/ µs\nwith a half-scale settling time of 4 µs with the output loaded.\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nThe AD5300 has a 3-wire serial interface ( SYNC , SCLK, and\nDIN), which is compatible with SPI, QSPI, and MICROWIREinterface standards as well as most DSPs. See Figure 1 for atiming diagram of a typical write sequence.\nThe write sequence begins by bringing the SYNC  line low. Data\nfrom the DIN line is clocked into the 16-bit shift register on the\nfalling edge of SCLK. The serial clock frequency can be as highas 30 MHz, making the AD5300 compatible with high speed\nDSPs. On the 16th falling clock edge, the last data bit is clocked\nin and the programmed function is executed (i.e., a change inDAC register contents and/or a change in the mode of operation).\nAt this stage, the SYNC  line may be kept low or be brought\nhigh. In either case, it must be brought high for a minimum of\n33 ns (V\nDD = 3.6 V to 5.5 V) or 50 ns (V DD = 2.7 V to 3.6 V)\nbefore the next write sequence so that a falling edge of SYNC\ncan initiate the next write sequence. Since the SYNC  buffer\ndraws more current when V IN = 2.4 V than it does when V IN =\n0.8 V, SYNC  should be idled low between write sequences for\neven lower power operation of the part. As previously men-tioned, however, it must be brought high again just before the\nnext write sequence.\nInput Shift Register\nThe input shift register is 16 bits wide (see Figure 22). The firsttwo bits are Don’t Cares. The next two are control bits thatcontrol which mode of operation the part is in (normal mode or\nany one of three power-down modes). There is a more complete\ndescription of the various modes in the Power-Down Modessection. The next eight bits are the data bits. These are transferred\nto the DAC register on the 16th falling edge of SCLK. Finally, the\nlast four bits are Don’t Cares.\nDB0 (LSB) DB15 (MSB)\n00 NORMAL OPERATION\n011 k /H9024 TO GND\n10 100k/H9024 TO GND\n11 THREE-STATEPOWER-DOWN MODESDATA BITSXX PD1 PD 0 D7 D6 D5D 4D 3D 2D 1D 0 X X X X\nFigure 22.

Output Stage During Power-Down\nThe bias generator, the output amplifier, the resistor string, and\nother associated linear circuitry are all shut down when thepower-down mode is activated. However, the contents of the\nDAC register are unaffected when in power-down. The time to\nexit power-down is typically 2.5 µs for V\nDD = 5 V and 5 µs for\nVDD = 3 V (see Figure 18).\nMICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING\nAD5300 to ADSP-2101/ADSP-2103 Interface\nFigure 25 shows a serial interface between the AD5300 and the\nADSP-2101/ADSP-2103. The ADSP-2101/ADSP-2103 shouldbe set up to operate in the SPORT transmit alternate framing\nmode. The ADSP-2101/ADSP-2103 SPORT is programmed\nthrough the SPORT control register and should be configuredas follows: internal clock operation, active low framing, 16-bit\nword length. Transmission is initiated by writing a word to the\nTx register after the SPORT has been enabled.\nADSP-2101/\nADSP-2103*\nDT\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYSYNC\nDIN\nSCLKAD5300*\nTFS\nSCLK\nFigure 25.

However, if SYNC  is brought high before the\n16th falling edge, this acts as an interrupt to the write sequence.\nThe shift register is reset and the write sequence is seen as\ninvalid; ne ither an update of the DAC register contents or a\nchange in the operating mode occurs—see Figure 23.\nPower-On Reset\nThe AD5300 contains a power-on reset circuit that controls theoutput voltage during power-up. The DAC register is filled withzeros and the output voltage is 0 V. It remains there until\na valid write sequence is made to the DAC. This is useful in\napplications where it is important to know the state of the out-put of the DAC while it is in the process of powering up.\nPower-Down Modes\nThe AD5300 contains four separate modes of operation. Thesemodes are software programmable by setting two bits (DB13and DB12) in the control register. Table I shows how the stateof the bits corresponds to the mode of operation of the device.\nTable I. Modes of Operation for the AD5300\nDB13 DB12 Operating Mode\n00 Normal OperationPower-Down Modes\n01 1  kΩ to GND\n10 100 k Ω to GND\n11 Three-State\nWhen both bits are set to 0, the part works normally with its\nnormal power consumption of 140 µA at 5 V. However, for the\nthree power-down modes, the supply current falls to 200 nA at\n5 V (50 nA at 3 V). Not only does the supply current fall but\nthe output stage is also internally switched from the output of\nthe amplifier to a resistor network of known values. This has anadvantage: the output imped ance of the part is known while the\npart is in power-down mode. There are three different options.The output is connected internally to GND through a 1 k Ω resis-\ntor or a 100 k Ω resistor, or it is left open-circuited (three-stated).\nThe output stage is illus trated in Figure 24.\nD\nAD5300\n–10– REV. *ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYSYNC\nDINAD5300*\nSCLKMICROWIRE*\nSK\nSOCS\nFigure 28. AD5300 to MICROWIRE Interface\nAPPLICATIONS\nUsing REF19x as a Power Supply for AD5300\nBecause the supply current required by the AD5300 is extremely\nlow, an alternative option is to use a REF19x voltage reference\n(REF195 for 5 V or REF193 for 3 V) to supply the requiredvoltage to the part—see Figure 29. This is especially useful if\nyour power supply is quite noisy or if the system supply voltages\nare at some value other than 5 V or 3 V (e.g., 15 V). The REF19xwill output a steady supply voltage for the AD5300. If the low\ndropout REF195 is used, the current it needs to supply to theAD5300 is 140 µA. This is with no load on the output of the\nDAC. When the DAC output is loaded, the REF195 also needs to\nsupply the current to the load. The total current required (witha 5 k Ω load on the DAC output) is\n140 µA + (5 V/5 k Ω) = 1.14 mA\nThe load regulation of the REF195 is typically 2 ppm/mA,\nwhich results in an error of 2.3 ppm (11.5 µV) for the 1.14 mA\ncurrent drawn from it. This corresponds to a 0.0006 LSB error.\nAD53003-WIRE\nSERIAL\nINTERFACESYNC\nSCLK\nDIN15V\n5V\n140/H9262A\nVOUT = 0V TO 5VREF195\nFigure 29.

SCK of the 68HC11/68L11\ndrives the SCLK of the AD5300, while the MOSI output drivesthe serial data line of the DAC. The SYNC  signal is derived\nfrom a port line (PC7). The setup conditions for correct opera-tion of this interface are as follows: the 68HC11/68L11 shouldbe configured so that its CPOL bit is a 0 and its CPHA bit is a\n1. When data is being transmitted to the DAC, the SYNC  line is\ntaken low (PC7). When the 68HC11/68L11 is configured as\nabove, data appearing on the MOSI output is valid on the falling\nedge of SCK. Serial data from the 68HC11/68L11 is transmit-\nted in 8-bit bytes with only eight falling clock edges occurring inthe transmit cycle. Data is transmitted MSB first. In order to\nload data to the AD5300, PC7 is left low after the first eight bits\nare transferred, and a second serial write operation is performedto the DAC and PC7 is taken high at the end of this procedure.\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYSYNC\nDINAD5300*\nSCLK68HC11/68L11*\nSCK\nMOSIPC7\nFigure 26.

The setup for the interface is as\nfollows: TXD of the 80C51/80L51 drives SCLK of the AD5300,\nwhile RXD drives the serial data line of the part. The SYNC\nsignal is again derived from a bit programmable pin on the port.\nIn this case, port line P3.3 is used. When data is to be transmitted\nto the AD5300, P3.3 is taken low. The 80C51/80L51 transmitsdata only in 8-bit bytes; thus, only eight falling clock edges\noccur in the transmit cycle. To load data to the DAC, P3.3 is\nleft low after the first eight bits are transmitted, and a second writecycle is initiated to transmit the second byte of data. P3.3 is taken\nhigh following the completion of this cycle. The 80C51/80L51\noutputs the serial data in a format that has the LSB first. TheAD5300 requires its data with the MSB as the first bit received.\nThe 80C51/80L51 transmit routine takes this into account.\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYSYNC\nDINAD5300*\nSCLK80C51/80L51*\nTXD\nRXDP3.3\nFigure 27.

AD5300 with an Opto-Isolated Interface\nPower Supply Bypassing and Grounding\nWhen accuracy is important in a circuit, it is helpful to carefully\nconsider the power supply and ground return layout on theboard. The printed circuit board containing the AD5300 should\nhave separate analog and digital sections, each having its own\narea of the board. If the AD5300 is in a system where otherdevices require an AGND to DGND connection, the connec-\ntion should be made at one point only. This ground point should\nbe as close as possible to the AD5300.\nThe power supply to the AD5300 should be bypassed with\n10 µF and 0.1 µF capacitors. The capacitors should be physi-\ncally as close as possible to the device with the 0.1 µF capacitor\nideally right up against the device. The 10 µF capacitors are the\ntantalum bead type. It is important that the 0.1 µF capacitor\nhas low effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series\ninduc tance (ESI), e.g., common ceramic types of capacitors. This\n0.1 µF capacitor provides a low impedance path to ground for\nhigh frequencies caused by transient currents due to internallogic switching.\nThe power supply line itself should have as large a trace as pos-\nsible to provide a low impedance path and reduce glitch effectson the supply line. Clocks and other fast switching digital signals\nshould be shielded from other parts of the board by digital\nground. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals if possible.\nWhen traces cross on opposite sides of the board, ensure that\nthey run at right angles to each other to reduce feedthrough\neffects through the board. The best board layout technique isthe microstrip technique where the component side of the board\nis dedicated to the ground plane only and the signal traces are\nplaced on the solder side. However, this is not always possiblewith a 2-layer board.R2 = 10k/H9024\n+5V\n–5VAD820/\nOP295\n3-WIRE\nSERIAL\nINTERFACE+5V\nAD530010/H9262F 0.1/H9262FVDDVOUTR1 = 10k/H9024\n/H115505V\nFigure 30. Bipolar Operation with the AD5300\nTwo 8-Bit AD5300s Together Make One 15-Bit DAC\nBy using the configuration in Figure 31, it can be seen that one\n15-bit DAC can be made with two 8-bit AD5300s. Because of\nthe low supply current the AD5300 requires, the output of oneDAC may be directed into the supply pin of the second DAC.\nThe first DAC has no problem sourcing the required 140 µA\nof current for the second DAC.\nSince the AD5300 works on any supply voltage between 2.5 V\nand 5.5 V, the output of the first DAC can be anywhere above\n2.5 V. For a V\nDD of 5 V, this allows the first DAC to use half of\nits output range (2.5 V to 5 V), which gives 7-bit resolution on\nthe output voltage. This output then becomes the supply and\nreference for the second DAC. The second DAC has 8-bit reso-\nlution on the output range, which gives an overall resolution forthe system of 15 bits.\nA level-shifter is required to ensure that the logic input voltages\ndo not exceed the supply voltage of the part. The microcontroller\noutputs 5 V signals, which need to be level shifted down to 2.5 V\nin the case of the second DAC having a supply of only 2.5 V.\n5V\nMICRO-\nCONTROLLERVOUT = 2.5V TO 5V\nLEVEL\nSHIFTERVOUT = 0V TO 5V\n15-BIT\nRESOLUTIONSYNC\nSCLK\nDINVDD\nAD5300AD5300VDDSYNC\nSCLK\nDIN\nFigure 31. 15-Bit DAC Using Two AD5300s\nUsing AD5300 with an Opto-Isolated Interface\nIn process-control applications in industrial environments, it is\noften necessary to use an opto-isolated interface to protect and\nisolate the controlling circuitry from any hazardous common-\nmode voltages that may occur in the area where the DAC isfunctioning. Opto-isolators provide isolation in excess of 3 kV.\nBecause the AD5300 uses a 3-wire serial logic interface, it\nrequires only three opto-isolators to provide the required isola-\ntion (see Figure 32). The power supply to the part also needs to\nbe isolated. This is done by using a transformer. On the DAC\nside of the transformer, a 5 V regulator provides the 5 V supplyrequired for the AD5300.\nD\nAD5300  \n \nRev.
