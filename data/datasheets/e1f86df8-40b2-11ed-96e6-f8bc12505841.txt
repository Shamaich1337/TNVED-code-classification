B | Page 9  of 16 THEOR Y OF OPERA TION \nThe AD P3338 an yCAP LDO us es a sin gle con trol lo op for \nregulation and reference functions. The output  voltage is sensed \nby a resistive voltage divider, consisting of R1 and R2, w hich is \nvaried to provide t he available output voltage opt ion. Feedback \nis taken from this network by way of a series diode (D1) an d a \nsecond resistor divider (R3 and R4) to the input of an amplifier. \nA very high gain error amplifier is us ed to control this loop. The \namplifier is constructed in such a way tha t equilibrium produces \na large, temperature-prop ortional input offset voltage that is \nrepeatable and very well controlled. The temperature-prop or-\ntional offset voltage is com bined with the com plementary dio de \nvoltage to form a vir tual ban d gap voltage that is im plicit in the \nnetwork, although it never app ears explicitly in the circuit. \nUltimately, this pa tented design m akes it possible to control the \nloop with only one am plifier. This techni que also improves the \nnoise characteristics o f the amplifier b y providing more flexi-\nbility on the trade off of noise sources that leads to a low noise \ndesig n. \nThe R1, R2 divider is chosen  in th e same ratio as the band gap \nvoltage to the output voltage. Although the R1, R2 resistor \ndivid er is lo aded by Diode D1 and a s econd divid er consisting \nof R3 a nd R4, t he values can be chosen to produce a t empera-\nture-stable output. This unique arrangement specifically corrects \nfor the loadin g of the divider , thus avoiding the error resulting \nfrom base curr ent loading in conventional circuits. \nThe p atented amplifier controls a ne w and un ique n oninverting \ndriver that drives the pass transistor, Q1. Th e use of this special \nnoninverting driver enables the frequency compensation to  include t he load ca pacitor in a pole-splitting arrangemen t to \nachie ve reduced sensitivity to the val ue, type, and ES R of the \nload ca pacitance.  \nMost LDOs place v ery strict requirements on the range of ESR \nvalues fo r the output ca pacitor because they are dif ficult to \nstabilize due to the uncertainty of load ca pacitance and r esis-\ntance. Moreover, the ESR value required to keep co nventional \nLDOs st able ch anges dep ending o n load an d temperature. \nThese ES R limitations mak e designing with LDOs more \ndifficult because of their unclear specifications and ext reme \nvariations over tem perature. \nWith the ADP3338 a nyCAP LDO, this is no longer tr ue. It can \nbe used with virtually any good quality capacitor, with no \nconstraint on the min imum ESR . This innovative desig n \nprovides cir cuit stability with just a smal l 1 µF c apacitor on the \noutput. Additional advantages of the pole-splitting scheme \ninclude su perior lin e noise rejection an d ver y high regulator \ngain to achie ve exce llent line and lo ad regulation. An impressive \n±1.4% acc uracy is gua ranteed over line, lo ad, and t emperature. \nAdditional features of the circuit include current limi t and \nthermal shutdown. \nVIN\nOUT\nADP3338C1\n1µFC2\n1µFVOUT\nGND IN\n02050-021 \nFigure 20.

B | Page 10  of 16 APPLI CATION INF ORMATION \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nOut put Cap acitor \nThe stability and transient response of the LDO is a function of \nthe output capacitor. The ADP3338 is s table with a wide ra nge \nof capacitor values, types, and ESR (anyCAP). A capacitor as \nlow as 1 µF is t he only requiremen t for stability. A hig her ca-\npacitance ma y be necessary if hi gh output current surges are \nanticipated, or if the output capacitor cannot be located near the \noutput and ground pins. T he ADP3338 is st able with extremely \nlow ES R capacitors (ESR ≈ 0) such as m ultilayer ceramic capacitors \n(ML CC) or OSCO N. N ote that the effective capacitance of some \ncapacitor types falls below the mini mum over temperature or \nwith dc voltage.  \nInp ut Capacit or \nAn in put bypass ca pacitor is n ot strictly required, but is r ecom-\nmended in an y application i nvolving lo ng input wires or high \nsource impedance. C onnecting a 1 µF  capacitor from the input \nto ground reduces the sensitivity of the cir cuit to PC bo ard \nlayout and i nput transients. If a larger o utput capacitor is \nnecessary, a larger val ue input capacitor is r ecommende d.  \nOUTPU T CURRENT LIMI T \nThe AD P3338 is s hort-circuit protected by limi ting the pass \ntransistor’s base drive current. The maxi mum output current is \nlimited to approximately 2 A (s ee Figure 16). \nTHERMAL OVERLOAD PROTECTION \nThe ADP3338 is protected against damage due to exces sive \npower diss ipation by its thermal overload p rotection circuit. \nTher mal p rotection limits the die t emperature to a maxim um of \n160°C. U nder extr eme con ditions, such as high ambient \ntemperature and p ower dissipation where the die tem perature \nstarts to rise above 160°C, t he output current is r educed u ntil \nthe die temperature has dr opped to a safe level.  \nCurrent and thermal lim it protections are intended to protect \nthe device against acci dental overload co nditions. For normal \noperation, ex ternally limi t the power dissi pation o f the device \nso the junction temperature do es not exce ed 150°C. CALCULATING POWER DISSIPATION \nDevice power dissipation is ca lculated as  \nPD = (VIN – VOUT) × ILOA D + (VIN × IGND) \nWhere ILOA D and IGND are load current and g round c urrent, and \nVIN and VOUT are the input and output voltages, respectively. \nAssumi ng the wo rst-cas e operating con ditions ar e I LOAD = 1.0 A,  \nIGND = 10 mA, VIN = 3.3 V , and V OUT = 2.5 V , the de vice power \ndissi pation is \nPD = (3.3 V – 2.5 V) × 10 00 mA + (3 .3 V × 10  mA)  = 833 mW \nSo, for a junction t emperature of 125°C a nd a maxim um \nambient temperature of 85°C, the required thermal r esistance \nfrom junction to ambient is \nC/W48W833.0C85C 125°=°−°=θJA  \nPRINTE D CI RCUIT BOAR D LAY OUT \nCONSI DERA TIONS \nThe t hermal r esistance, θJA, of the SOT-223 is det ermined by the \nsum of the junction-to-case and the case-to-ambient thermal \nresistances. Th e junction-t o-case ther mal r esistance, θJC, is \ndeter mined by the package design and is sp ecified at 26.8 °C/W. \nHowever, the cas e-to-ambient thermal r esistance is deter mined \nby the printed circuit board des ign.  \nAs shown in Figure 22, t he am ount of copper to which t he \nADP3338 is m ounted affects ther mal p erformance. W hen \nmounted to the mini mal pads of 2 oz. co pper, as shown in \nFigure 22 (a), θ JA is 126.6°C/W . Adding a smal l copper pad \nunder the ADP3338, as shown in Figure 2 2 (b), reduces the θJA to \n102.9°C/W . Increas ing the copper pad to one s quare inch, as \nshown in Figure 22 ( c), reduces the θJA even further to 52 .8°C/W. 02050-022\nc ab \nFigure 22. PCB L ayouts \n ADP3338\n \nRev. B | Page 11 of 16 Use the following general guidelines when designing printed \ncircuit boards: \n• Keep the output capacitor as close as possible to the output \nand ground pins. \n• Keep the input capacitor as close as possible to the input \nand ground pins. \n• Specify thick copper and use wide traces for optimum heat \ntransfer. PC board traces with larger cross sectional areas \nremove more heat from the ADP3338. \n• Decrease thermal resistance by adding a copper pad under \nthe ADP3338, as shown in Figure 22 (b). • Use the adjacent area to the ADP3338 to add more copper \naround it. Connecting the copper area to the output of the \nADP3338, as shown in Figure 22 (c), is best, but thermal performance will be improved even if it is connected to \nother signals. \n• Use additional copper layers or planes to reduce the \nthermal resistance. Again, connecting the other layers to \nthe output of the ADP3338 is best, but is not necessary. \nWhen connecting the output pad to other layers, use \nmultiple vias. \n \nADP3338 \n \nRev.
