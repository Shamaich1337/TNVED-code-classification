General description\nThe 74AUP1G04 is a single inverter.\nSchmitt-trigger action at all inputs makes the circuit tolerant of slower input rise and fall times\nacross the entire VCC range from 0.8 V to 3.6 V.\nThis device ensures a very low static and dynamic power consumption across the entire V CC range\nfrom 0.8 V to 3.6 V.\nThis device is fully specified for partial Power-down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry\ndisables the output, preventing the damaging backflow current through the device when it is\npowered down.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range from 0.8 V to 3.6 V\n•CMOS low power dissipation\n•High noise immunity\n•Complies with JEDEC standards:\n•JESD8-12 (0.8 V to 1.3 V)\n•JESD8-11 (0.9 V to 1.65 V)\n•JESD8-7 (1.65 V to 1.95 V)\n•JESD8-5 (2.3 V to 2.7 V)\n•JESD8C (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•Low static power consumption; I CC = 0.9 μA (maximum)\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78B Class II\n•Overvoltage tolerant inputs to 3.6 V\n•Low noise overshoot and undershoot < 10 % of V CC\n•IOFF circuitry provides partial Power-down mode operation\n•Multiple package options\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM: ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-001 class 3A exceeds 5000 V\n•CDM: ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-002 class C3 exceeds 1000 V\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\nNexperia 74AUP1G04\nLow-power inverter\n3.

Nexperia does not give any representations or\nwarranties as to the accuracy or completeness of information included herein\nand shall have no liability for the consequences of use of such information.\nShort data sheet  — A short data sheet is an extract from a full data sheet\nwith the same product type number(s) and title. A short data sheet is\nintended for quick reference only and should not be relied upon to contain\ndetailed and full information. For detailed and full information see the relevant\nfull data sheet, which is available on request via the local Nexperia sales\noffice. In case of any inconsistency or conflict with the short data sheet, the\nfull data sheet shall prevail.\nProduct specification  — The information and data provided in a Product\ndata sheet shall define the specification of the product as agreed between\nNexperia and its customer, unless Nexperia and customer have explicitly\nagreed otherwise in writing. In no event however, shall an agreement be\nvalid in which the Nexperia product is deemed to offer functions and qualities\nbeyond those described in the Product data sheet.\nDisclaimers\nLimited warranty and liability  — Information in this document is believed\nto be accurate and reliable. However, Nexperia does not give any\nrepresentations or warranties, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy\nor completeness of such information and shall have no liability for the\nconsequences of use of such information.

This\ndocument supersedes and replaces all information supplied prior to the\npublication hereof.\nSuitability for use  — Nexperia products are not designed, authorized or\nwarranted to be suitable for use in life support, life-critical or safety-critical\nsystems or equipment, nor in applications where failure or malfunction\nof an Nexperia product can reasonably be expected to result in personalinjury, death or severe property or environmental damage. Nexperia and its\nsuppliers accept no liability for inclusion and/or use of Nexperia products in\nsuch equipment or applications and therefore such inclusion and/or use is at\nthe customer’s own risk.\nQuick reference data  — The Quick reference data is an extract of the\nproduct data given in the Limiting values and Characteristics sections of this\ndocument, and as such is not complete, exhaustive or legally binding.\nApplications  — Applications that are described herein for any of these\nproducts are for illustrative purposes only. Nexperia makes no representation\nor warranty that such applications will be suitable for the specified use\nwithout further testing or modification.\nCustomers are responsible for the design and operation of their applications\nand products using Nexperia products, and Nexperia accepts no liability for\nany assistance with applications or customer product design. It is customer’s\nsole responsibility to determine whether the Nexperia product is suitable\nand fit for the customer’s applications and products planned, as well as\nfor the planned application and use of customer’s third party customer(s).\nCustomers should provide appropriate design and operating safeguards to\nminimize the risks associated with their applications and products.\nNexperia does not accept any liability related to any default, damage, costs\nor problem which is based on any weakness or default in the customer’s\napplications or products, or the application or use by customer’s third party\ncustomer(s). Customer is responsible for doing all necessary testing for the\ncustomer’s applications and products using Nexperia products in order to\navoid a default of the applications and the products or of the application or\nuse by customer’s third party customer(s). Nexperia does not accept any\nliability in this respect.\nLimiting values  — Stress above one or more limiting values (as defined in\nthe Absolute Maximum Ratings System of IEC 60134) will cause permanent\ndamage to the device. Limiting values are stress ratings only and (proper)\noperation of the device at these or any other conditions above those\ngiven in the Recommended operating conditions section (if present) or the\nCharacteristics sections of this document is not warranted. Constant or\nrepeated exposure to limiting values will permanently and irreversibly affect\nthe quality and reliability of the device.\nTerms and conditions of commercial sale — Nexperia products are\nsold subject to the general terms and conditions of commercial sale, as\npublished at http://www.nexperia.com/profile/terms, unless otherwise agreed\nin a valid written individual agreement. In case an individual agreement is\nconcluded only the terms and conditions of the respective agreement shall\napply.
