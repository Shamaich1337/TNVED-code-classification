(Resistors, capacitors and other passive components will have different \nappearance and color caused by the different supplier.)  \n(11) Raystar have the right to change the PCB Rev. (In order to satisfy the supplying stability, \nmanagement optimization and the best product performance...etc, under the premise of not \naffecting the electrical characteristics and external dimensions, Rays tar have the right to modify \nthe version.)  \n \n11.1 Handling Precautions  \n(1) Since the display panel is being made of glass, do not apply mechanical impacts such us \ndropping from a high position.  \n(2) If the display panel is broken by some accident and the internal organic substance leaks \nout, be careful not to inhale nor lick the organic substance.  \n(3) If pressure is applied to the display surface or its neighborhood of the OLED display module, \nthe cell structure may be damaged and be careful not to apply p ressure to these sections.  \n(4) The polarizer covering the surface of the OLED display module is soft and easily scratched. \nPlease be careful when handling the OLED display module.  \n(5) When the surface of the polarizer of the OLED display module has soil, c lean the surface. \nIt takes advantage of by using following adhesion tape.  \n* Scotch Mending Tape No. 810 or an equivalent  \nNever try to breathe upon the soiled surface nor wipe the surface using cloth containing solvent \nAlso, pay attention that the following  liquid and solvent may spoil the polarizer:  \n* Water  \n* Ketone  \n* Aromatic Solvents  \n(6) Hold OLED display module very carefully when placing OLED display module into the \nSystem housing. Do not apply excessive stress or pressure to OLED display module. And, \ndo not over bend the film with electrode pattern layouts. These stresses will influence the \ndisplay performance. Also, secure sufficient rigidity for the outer cases.  \n \n    \n \n \nPage 25 , Total 28 Pages   \n(7) Do not apply stress to the LSI chips and the surrounding molded sections.  \n(8) Do not disassemble nor modify the OLED display module.  \n(9) Do not apply input signals while the logic power is off.  \n(10) Pay sufficient attention to the working environments when handing OLED display modules \nto prevent occurrence of element breakage accidents  by static electricity.  \n* Be sure to make human body grounding when handling OLED display modules.  \n* Be sure to ground tools to use or assembly such as soldering irons.  \n* To suppress generation of static electricity, avoid carrying out assembly work under dry \nenvironments.  \n* Protective film is being applied to the surface of the display panel of the OLED display module. \nBe careful since static electricity may be generated when exfoliating the protective film.  \n(11) Protection film is being applied to the sur face of the display panel and removes the \nprotection film before assembling it. At this time, if the OLED display module has been \nstored surface of the display panel after removed of the film. In such case, remove the \nresidue material by the method introdu ced in the above Section 5.  \n(12) If electric current is applied when the OLED display module is being dewed or when it is \nplaced under high humidity environments, the electrodes may be corroded and be careful \nto avoid the above.  \n \n11.2 Storage Precautions  \n(1) When storing OLED display modules, put them in static electricity preventive bags avoiding  \nexposure to direct sun light nor to lights of fluorescent lamps. And, also, avoiding high  \ntemperature and high humidity environment or low temperatur e (less than 0 °C) \nenvironments.(We recommend you to store these modules in the packaged state when they \nwere shipped from Raystar  Optronics Inc. At that time, be careful not to let water drops \nadhere to the packages or bags nor let dewing occur with them.  \n(2) If electric current is applied when water drops are adhering to the surface of the OLED \ndisplay module, when the OLED display module is being dewed or when it is placed under \nhigh humidity environments, the electrodes may be corroded and be careful abo ut the above.  \n\n \n    \n \n \nPage 26 , Total 28 Pages  11.3 Designing Precautions  \n(1) The absolute maximum ratings are the ratings which cannot be exceeded for OLED display \nmodule, and if these values are exceeded, panel damage may be happen.  \n(2) To prevent occurrence of malfunctioning by noise, pay attention to satisfy the VIL and VIH \nspecifications and, at the same time, to make the signal line cable as short as possible.  \n(3) We recommend you to install excess current preventive unit (fuses, etc.) to the power circuit \n(VDD). (Recommend value: 0.5A)  \n(4) Pay sufficient attention to avoid occurrence of mutual noise interference with the neighboring \ndevices.  \n(5) As for EMI, take necessary measures on the equipment side basically.  \n(6) When fastening the OLED display module, fa sten the external plastic housing section.  \n(7) If power supply to the OLED display module is forcibly shut down by such errors as taking \nout the main battery while the OLED display panel is in operation, we cannot guarantee the \nquality of this OLED display module.
