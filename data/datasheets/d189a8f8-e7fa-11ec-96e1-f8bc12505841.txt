The DS90UB953-Q1  serializer is optimized to interface with the DS90UB954-Q1 deserializer (dual\nhub), the DS90UB960-Q1 deserializer (quad hub), as well as other potential future deserializers. The\ninterconnect between the serializer and the deserializer can be either a coaxial cable or shielded-twisted pair\n(STP) cable. The DS90UB953-Q1 was designed to support multi-sensor systems such as surround view, and as\nsuch has the ability to synchronize sensors through the DS90UB954-Q1 and DS90UB960-Q1 hubs.\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  serializer and companion deserializer incorporate an I2C-compatible interface. The I2C-\ncompatible interface allows programming of serializer or deserializer devices from a local host controller. In\naddition, the devices incorporate a bidirectional control channel (BCC) that allows communication between the\nserializer and deserializer, as well as between remote I2C slave devices.\nThe bidirectional control channel (BCC) is implemented through embedded signaling in the high-speed forward\nchannel (serializer to deserializer), combined with lower speed signaling in the reverse channel (deserializer to\nserializer). Through this interface, the BCC provides a mechanism to bridge I2C transactions across the serial\nlink from one I2C bus to another.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nDOUT+DPHY \nReceiverFIFOEncoder/ \nFormatterSerializerCable \nDriver\nClock Gen\nBCC\nReceiverController\nI2C \nControllerFIFODecode/\nEncodeClock/Data \nRecoveryCLK_OUTCLKIN\nMODE/ IDX\nI2C_SDA\nI2C_SCLCSI-2\nPDB Vbias_internal\nDOUT-\nInternal AON Clockwww.ti.comDS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\n7.3 Feature Description\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  FPD-Link III serializer is designed to support high-speed raw data sensors including 2-MP\nimagers at 60 fps, as well as 4-MP and 30-fps cameras, satellite RADAR, LIDAR, and time of flight (ToF)\ncameras. The chip features a forward channel capable of up to 4.16 Gbps, as well as an ultra-low latency 50-\nMbps bidirectional control channel. The transmission of the forward channel, bidirectional control channel, and\npower is supported over coaxial (Power-over-Coax) or STP cables. The DS90UB953-Q1 features advanced data\nprotection and diagnostic features to support ADAS and autonomous driving. Together with a companion\ndeserializer, the DS90UB953-Q1 delivers precise multi-camera sensor clock and sensor synchronization.\n7.3.1 CSI-2 Receiver\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  receives CSI-2 video data from the sensor. During CSI-2 operation, the D-PHY consists of\na clock lane and one or more data lanes. The DS90UB953-Q1 is a slave device and only supports unidirectional\nlane in the forward direction. Low Power Escape mode is not supported.\n7.3.1.1 CSI-2 Receiver Operating Modes\nDuring normal operation a data lane will be in either control or high-speed mode. In high-speed mode, the data\ntransmission happens in a burst and starts and ends at a stop state (LP-11). There is a transition state to take\nthe D-PHY from a normal mode to the low-power state.\nThe sequence to enter high-speed mode is: LP-11, LP-01, LP-00. After the sequence is entered, the data lane\nremains in high-speed mode until a stop state (LP-11) is received.\n7.3.1.2 CSI-2 Receiver High-Speed Mode\nDuring high-speed data transmission, the digital D-PHY will enable termination signal to allow proper termination\nof the HS RX of the Analog D-PHY, and the LP RX should stay at LP-00 state. Both CSI-2 data lane and clock\nlane operate in the same manner. The DS90UB953-Q1  supports CSI-2 continuous clock lane mode where the\nclock lane remains in high-speed mode.\n7.3.1.3 CSI-2 Protocol Layer\nThere are two different types of CSI-2 packets: a short packet and a long packet. Short packets have information\nsuch as the frame start/ line start, and long packets carry the data after the frame start is asserted. Figure 7-1\nshows the structure of the CSI-2 protocol layer with short and long packets. The DS90UB953-Q1  supports 1, 2,\nand 4 lane configurations.\nKEY:\nST ± Start of Transmission PH ± Packet Header\nET ± End of Transmission PF ± Packet Footer\nLPS ± Low Power StateDATA :\nDATA DATA PF PH PH PF SP SP LPS ET ST LPS ET ST ST LPS ET ST ETShort \nPacketLong \nPacketLong \nPacketShort \nPacket\nFigure 7-1.

The packet header is further composed of\nthree elements: an 8-bit data identifier, a 16-bit word count field, and an 8-bit ECC. The packet footer only has\none element—a 16-bit checksum.

ECC in the 32-bit long packet header can be\ncorrected when there is a 1-bit error and detected when there is a 2-bit error. This feature is added to monitor the\nCSI-2 input for ECC 1-bit error correction. When ECC error is detected, ECC error detection register will be set\nand an alarm indicator bit can be sent to the deserializer to indicate the ECC error has been detected. A register\ncontrol can be used to either enable or disable the alarm.\n7.3.1.6.2 CSI-2 Check Sum Detection\nA CSI-2 long packet header contains a 16-bit check sum before the end of transmission. The DS90UB953-Q1\ncalculates the check sum of the incoming CSI-2 data. If a check sum error is detected, the check sum errorwww.ti.comDS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nstatus can be saved in the CSI_ERR_STATUS register (0x5D), then forwarded to the deserializer through the\nbidirectional control channel.\n7.3.1.6.3 D-PHY Error Detection\nDS90UB953-Q1 detect and reports SoT and SoT Sync errors.\n7.3.1.6.4 CSI-2 Receiver Status\nFor the receive ports, several status functions can be tracked and monitored through register access. The status\nindications are available for error conditions as well as indications of change in line length measurements. These\nare available through the CSI_ERR_CNT (0x5C), CSI_ERR_STATUS (0x5D), CSI_ERR_DLANE01 (0x5E),\nCSI_ERR_DLANE23 (0x5F), and CSI_ERR_CLK_LANE (0x60) registers.\n7.3.2 FPD-Link III Forward Channel Transmitter\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  features a high-speed signal transmitter capable of driving signals at rates of up to 4.16\nGbps.\n7.3.2.1 Frame Format\nThe DS90UB953-Q1 formats the data into 40-bit long frames. Each frame is encoded to ensure DC balance and\nto ensure sufficient data line transitions. Each frame contains video payload data, I2C forward channel data,\nCRC information, framing information, and information regarding the state of the CSI-2 interface.\n7.3.3 FPD-Link III Back Channel Receiver\nThe FPD-Link III back channel receives an encoded back channel signal over the FPD-Link III interface. The\nback channel frame is a 30-bit frame that contains I2C commands and GPIO data. The back channel frame\nreceives an encoded clock and data from the deserializer, thus the data bit rate is one-half the frequency of the\nhighest frequency received.\nThe back channel frequency is programmable for operation with compatible deserializers. The default setting is\ndetermined by the MODE strap pin. For operation with the DS90UB954-Q1 or DS90UB960-Q1, the back\nchannel should be programmed for 50-Mbps operation in DS90UB953-Q1  synchronous mode and programmed\nfor 10-Mbps operation for non-synchronous modes.\n7.3.4 Serializer Status and Monitoring\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  features enhanced FPD-Link III diagnostics, system monitoring, and Built-In Self Test\ncapabilities. The device monitors forward channel and back channel data for errors and reports them in the\nstatus registers. The device also supports voltage and temperature measurement for system level diagnostics.\nThe Built-In Self Test feature allows testing of the forward channel and back channel data transmissions without\nexternal data connections.\n7.3.4.1 Forward Channel Diagnostics\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  monitors the status of the forward channel link. The forward channel high-speed PLL lock\nstatus is reported in the HS_PLL_LOCK bit (Register 0x52[2]). When paired with the DS90UB954-Q1, the FPD-\nLink III deserializer LOCK status is also reported in the RX_LOCK_DETECT bit (Register 0x52[6]).\n7.3.4.2 Back Channel Diagnostics\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  monitors the status of the back channel link. The back channel CRC errors are reported in\nthe CRC_ERR bit (Register 0x52[1]). The number of CRC errors are stored in the CRC error counters and\nreported in the CRC_ERR_CNT1 (Register 0x55) and CRC_ERR_CNT2 (Register 0x56) registers. The CRC\nerror counters are reset by setting the CRC_ERR_CLR (Register 0x49[3]) to 1.\nWhen running the BIST function, the DS90UB953-Q1  reports if a BIST CRC error is detected in the\nBIST_CRC_ERR bit (Register 0x52[3]). The number of BIST errors are reported in the BIST_ERR_CNT field\n(Register 0x54). The BIST CRC error counter is reset by setting the BIST_CRC_ERR_CLR (Register 0x49[5]) to\n1.DS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.3.4.3 Voltage and Temperature Sensing\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  supports voltage measurement and temperature measurement. The temperature and\nvoltage sensors are both equipped with a 3-bit ADC. The engineer can configure these sensors to monitor a\nsignal and raise a flag when a signal goes outside of a set limit. For example, a voltage sensor can be used to\nmonitor the 1.8-V line and raise a flag if the voltage goes above 1.85 V or below 1.75 V. This flag can then be\ntransferred to the deserializer and set an interrupt at the deserializer end of the link. In a similar manner, the\ntemperature sensor will trigger an alarm bit when the internal temperature of DS90UB953-Q1  is outside the\nrange.\nBoth GPIO0 and GPIO1 can be configured to sense the voltage applied at their inputs. Table 7-32  through Table\n7-38 cover the registers specific to this section.\nFor a given voltage or temperature, the measurement accuracy is ±1 LSB. This means that for a given input\nvoltage or temperature corresponding to the nearest value in Table 7-2  and Table 7-3 , the resulting ADC output\ncode will be accurate to the nearest ±1 code.\nTable 7-2.

Register 0x24[7] bit readout indicates the \nAlarm bit. The alarm bit can be routed to GPIO3/INT through GPIO_PIN_CTL and GPIO_OUT_SRC registers.\n7.3.4.4 Built-In Self Test\nAn optional at-speed Built-In Self Test (BIST) feature supports high-speed serial link and back channel testing\nwithout external data connections. This is useful in the prototype stage, equipment production, in-system test,\nand system diagnostics.\nBIST mode is enabled by the BIST configuration register 0xB3[0] on the deserializer, and should only run in the\nsynchronous mode. When BIST is activated at the deserializer, a BIST enable signal is sent to the serializer\nthrough the back channel. The serializer outputs a continuous stream of a pseudo-random sequence and drives\nthe link at speed. The deserializer detects the test pattern and monitors the pattern for errors. The serializer also\ntracks errors indicated by the CRC fields in each back channel frame. While the lock indications are required to\nidentify the beginning of proper data reception, the best indication of any link failures or data corruption is the\ncontent of the error counter in the BIST_ERR_COUNT register 0x57 for each RX port on the deserializer side.\nBIST mode is useful in the prototype stage, equipment production, in-system test, and system diagnostics.\n7.3.5 FrameSync Operation\nWhen paired with compatible deserializers, any of the DS90UB953-Q1  GPIO pins can be use for frame\nsynchronization. This feature is useful when multiple sensors are connected to a deserializer hub. A frame\nsynchronization signal (FrameSync) can be sent through the back channel using any of the back channel\nGPIOs. The FrameSync signal arrives at the serializers with limited skew.\n7.3.5.1 External FrameSync\nIn External FrameSync mode, an external signal is input to the deserializer through one of the GPIO pins on the\ndevice. The external FrameSync signal may be propagated to one or more of the attached FPD-Link III\nserializers through a GPIO signal in the back channel. The expected skew timing for external FrameSync mode\nis on the order of one back channel frame period or 600 ns when operating at 50 Mbps.\nDeserializer\nBC_GPIOxBC_GPIOxSerializerGPIOx\nSerializerGPIOxFPD-Link III\nFPD-Link III\nGPIOy\nExternal \nFrame Sync\nFigure 7-4.

These GPIOs are programmable for use in\nmultiple situations. GPIO0 and GPIO1 have additional diagnostics functionality and may be programmed to\nsense external voltage levels.\n7.3.6.1 GPIO Status\nThe status HIGH or LOW of each GPIO pin 0 through 3 may be read through the GPIO_PIN_STS register 0x53.\nThis register read operation provides the status of the GPIO pin independent of whether the GPIO pin is\nconfigured as an input or output.\n7.3.6.2 GPIO Input Control\nUpon initialization, GPIO0 through GPIO3 are enabled as inputs by default. The GPIO_INPUT_CTRL (0x0E)\nregister (bits 3:0) allows control of the input enable. If a GPIO_INPUT_CTRL[3:0] bit is set to 1, then the\ncorresponding GPIO_INPUT_CTRL[7:4] bit must be set to 0.\n7.3.6.3 GPIO Output Control\nIndividual GPIO output control is programmable through the GPIO_INPUT_CTRL (0x0E) register (bits 7:4) in\nTable 7-25 . If a GPIO_INPUT_CTRL[7:4] bit is set to 1, then the corresponding GPIO_INPUT_CTRL[3:0] bit\nmust be set to 0.www.ti.comDS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\n7.3.6.4 Forward Channel GPIO\nThe input on the DS90UB953-Q1  GPIO pins can be forwarded to compatible deserializers over the FPD-Link III\ninterface. Up to four GPIOs are supported in the forward direction.\nThe timing for the forward channel GPIO is dependent on the number of GPIOs assigned at the serializer. When\na single GPIO input from the DS90UB953-Q1  serializer is linked to a compatible deserializer GPIO output, the\nvalue is sampled at every forward channel transmit frame. Two linked GPIO are sampled every two forward\nchannel frames, and three or four linked GPIO are sampled every five frames. The typical minimum latency for\nthe GPIO remains consistent (approximately 225 ns), but as the information is spread over multiple frames, the\njitter is typically increased on the order of the sampling period (number of forward channel frames). TI\nrecommends that the user maintain a 4x oversampling ratio for linked GPIO throughput. For example, when\noperating in 4-Gbps synchronous mode with REFCLK = 25 MHz, the maximum recommended GPIO input\nfrequency based on the number of GPIO linked over the forward channel is shown in Table 7-4 .\nTable 7-4.

The maximum signal frequency\nthat can be received over the FPD-Link III back channel is dependent on the DS90UB953-Q1  clocking mode as\nshown in Table 7-5 .\nTable 7-5.

In the\nDS90UB953-Q1 , the forward channel operates at a higher bandwidth than the requirement set by the video data\ntransported, and the forward channel data rate is set by a reference clock. The clocking mode determines what\nthe device uses as the reference clock, and the most common configuration is synchronous mode in which no\nlocal reference oscillator is required. See Table 7-6  for more information.\nThe default mode of the DS90UB953-Q1  is set by the application of a bias on the MODE pin during power up.\nMore information on setting the operation modes can be found in Section 7.4.2 .DS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nTable 7-6.

The synchronous clocking mode also eliminates the cost, space, and potential\nfailure point of a reference oscillator within the sensor module.\nIn this mode, a clock is passed from the deserializer to the serializer through the FPD-Link III back channel, and\nthe serializer is able to use this clock both as a reference clock for an attached image sensor, as well as a\nreference clock for the link back to the deserializer (FPD-Link III forward channel). For operation in this mode,\nthe DS90UB953-Q1  must be paired with a deserializer that can support this feature such as the DS90UB954-\nQ1, DS90UB936-Q1, DS90UB962-Q1 or DS90UB960-Q1.\n7.4.1.2 Non-Synchronous Clock Mode\nIn the non-synchronous clock mode, the external reference clock is supplied to the serializer. The serializer uses\nthis clock to derive the FPD-Link III forward channel and an external reference clock for an attached image\nsensor. When in CSI-2 mode, the CSI-2 interface may be synchronous to this clock. The CSI-2 rate must be\nlower than the line rate. For example, with a 50-MHz clock, the FPD-Link III forward channel rate is 4 Gbps, the\nCSI-2 throughput must be ≤ 3.32 Gbps (see Table 7-6 ).\n7.4.1.3 Non-Synchronous Internal Mode\nIn the non-synchronous internal clocking mode, the serializer uses the internal Always-on Clock (AON) as the\nreference clock for the forward channel. The OSCCLK_SEL select must be asserted (0x05[3]=1) to enable\nmaximum data rate when using internal clock mode, and the CLK_OUT function must be disabled. A separate\nreference is provided to the image sensor or ISP. When in CSI-2 mode, the CSI-2 interface may be synchronous\nto this clock. The CSI-2 rate must be lower than the line rate. For example, with the internal clock of 24.2 MHz,\nthe FPD-Link III forward channel rate is 3.872 Gbps and the CSI-2 throughput must be ≤ 3.1 Gbps (See Table\n7-6).\n7.4.1.4 DVP Backwards Compatibility Mode\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  can be placed into DVP mode to be backward-compatible with the DS90UB934-Q1 or\nDS90UB914A-Q1. While the mode should have been configured using the Mode pin on the DS90UB953-Q1, the\nregister MODE_SEL register 0x03[2:0] can be used to verify or override the current mode. This field always\nindicates the mode setting of the device. When bit 4 of this register is 0, this field is read-only and shows the\nmode setting. Mode is latched from strap value when PDB transitions LOW to HIGH, and the value should read\nback 101 (0x5) if the resistive strap is set correctly to DVP external clock backward-compatible mode.\nAlternatively, when bit 4 of this register is set to 1, the MODE field is read/write and can be programmed to 101\nto assign the correct backward-compatible MODE. This is shown in Table 7-14 .\nCSI-2 input data provided to the DS90UB953-Q1 must be synchronized to the input frequency applied to CLKIN\nwhen using DVP external clock mode. The PCLK frequency output from the DS90UB934-Q1 or DS90UB914A-\nQ1 deserializer will also be related to CLKIN when in DVP external clock mode. See Backward compatibility\nmodes for operation with parallel output deserializers  (SNLA270) for more information.\nTable 7-7.

CLK_OUT functionality is disabled when operating in non-\nsynchronous internal clocking mode. The frequency of the external CLK_OUT is set by (see Equation 1  and\nEquation 2 ).DS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nMCLK_OUT FCHS_CLK_DIV N u u(1)\nwhere\n• FC is the forward channel data rate, and M, HS_CLK_DIV, and N are parameters set by registers 0x06 and\n0x07\nSPACER\n\x1fFC1.05 GHzHS_CLK_DIV\n(2)\nThe PLL that generates CLK_OUT is a digital PLL, and as such, has very low jitter if the ratio N/M is an integer.\nIf N/M is not an integer, then the jitter on the signal is approximately equal to HS_CLK_DIV/FC—so if it is not\npossible to have an integer ratio of N/M, it is best to select a smaller value for HS_CLK_DIV.\nIf a particular CLK_OUT frequency, such as 37.125 MHz, is required for a system, the designer can select the\nvalues M=9, N=0xF2, and HS_CLK_DIV=4 to achieve an output frequency of 37.190 MHz and a frequency error\nof 0.175% with an associate jitter of approximately 1 ns. Alternately, the designer could use M=1, N=0x1B,\nHS_CLK_DIV=4 for CLK_OUT = 37.037 MHz, and a frequency error of 0.24% for less jitter. A third alternative\nwould be to use M=1, N=0x1E, and HS_CLK_DIV=4, but rather than using a 25.000-MHz reference clock\nfrequency (REFCLK) for the deserializer in synchronous mode, use a frequency of 25.059 MHz. The 2x\nreference then fed to the DS90UB953-Q1  from the deserializer back channel will allow generating CLK_OUT =\n37.124 MHz with both low jitter and a low frequency error.\n7.4.2 MODE\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  can operate in one of four different modes. The user can apply the bias voltage to the\nMODE pin during power up to operate in default mode. To set this voltage, a potential divider between VDDPLL\nand GND is used to apply the appropriate bias. This potential divider should be referenced to the potential on the\nVDDD pin. After power up, the MODE can be read or changed through register access.\nDS90UB953-Q1MODE\nRLOW1.8V\nRHIGH\nFigure 7-7.

Note that RAW12 LF is not supported on the DS90UB953-\nQ1.\n7.5 Programming\n7.5.1 I2C Interface Configuration\nThis serializer may be configured by the use of an I2C-compatible serial control bus. Multiple devices may share\nthe serial control bus (up to two device addresses are supported). The device address is set through a resistor\ndivider (R HIGH and R LOW – see Figure 7-8 ) connected to the IDX pin.\n7.5.1.1 CLK_OUT/IDX\nThe CLK_OUT/IDX pin serves two functions. At power up, the voltage on the IDX pin is compared to VDD and\nthe ratio sets various parameters for configuration of the DS90UB953-Q1 . After the DS90UB953-Q1  is\nconfigured, the CLK_OUT/IDX pin switches over to a clock source, intended to provide a reference clock to the\nimage sensor. A minimum load impedance at the CLK_OUT/IDX pin of 35 k Ω is required when using the\nCLK_OUT function.\n7.5.1.1.1 IDX\nThe IDX pin configures the control interface to one of two possible device addresses—either the 1.8-V or 3.3-V\nreferenced I2C address. A pullup resistor and a pulldown resistor must be used to set the appropriate voltage on\nthe IDX input pin (see ). The IDX resistor divider must be referred to Pin #25 (after the ferrite filter on the\nDS90UB953-Q1 pin side).\nTable 7-9.

Circuit to Bias IDX Pin\n7.5.2 I2C Interface Operation\nThe serial control bus consists of two signals: SCL and SDA. SCL is a Serial Bus Clock Input / Output signal and\nthe SDA is the Serial Bus Data Input / Output signal. Both SCL and SDA signals require an external pullup\nresistor to V I2C, chosen to be either 1.8 V or 3.3 V.\nFor the standard and fast I2C modes, a pullup resistor of R PU = 4.7 k Ω is recommended, while a pullup resistor\nof R PU = 470 Ω is recommended for the fast plus mode. However, the pullup resistor value may be additionally\nadjusted for capacitive loading and data rate requirements. The signals are either pulled High or driven Low. The\nIDX pin configures the control interface to one of two possible device addresses. A pullup resistor (R HIGH) and a\npulldown resistor (R LOW) may be used to set the appropriate voltage on the IDX input pin.\nThe Serial Bus protocol is controlled by START, START-Repeated, and STOP phases. A START occurs when\nSDA transitions Low while SCL is High. A STOP occurs when SDA transitions High while SCL is also HIGH. See\nFigure 7-9 .\nSDA\nSCL\nS P\nSTART condition, or\nSTART repeat conditionSTOP condition\nFigure 7-9. Start and Stop Conditions\nTo communicate with an I2C slave, the host controller (master) sends data to the slave address and waits for a\nresponse. This response is referred to as an acknowledge bit (ACK). If a slave on the bus is addressed correctly,\nthe slave Acknowledges (ACKs) the master by driving the SDA bus low. If the address does not match a slave\naddress of the device, the slave Not-acknowledges (NACKs) the master by pulling the SDA High. ACKs also\noccur on the bus when data is being transmitted. When the master is writing data, the slave ACKs after every\ndata byte is successfully received. When the master is reading data, the master ACKs after every data byte is\nreceived to let the slave know that the master wants to receive another data byte. When the master wants to\nstop reading, the master NACKs after the last data byte and creates a stop condition on the bus. All\ncommunication on the bus begins with either a start condition or a repeated start condition. All communication on\nthe bus ends with a stop condition. A READ is shown in Figure 7-10  and a WRITE is shown in Figure 7-11 .www.ti.comDS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nFigure 7-10.

The I2C master regenerates the\nI2C read or write access using timing controls in registers 0x0B and 0x0C to regenerate the clock and data\nsignals to meet the desired I2C timing in standard, fast, or fast-plus modes of operation.\nI2C master SCL high time is set in register 0x0B. This field configures the high pulse width of the SCL output\nwhen the serializer is the master on the local I2C bus. The default value is set to provide a minimum 5-µs SCL\nhigh time with the internal reference clock at 26.25 MHz including five additional oscillator clock periods or\nsynchronization and response time.

Two types of patterns are supported: Reference color bar patterns\nand fixed color patterns accessed by the pattern generator page 0 in the indirect register set. See Section\n7.7.133  for more information on internal registers.\n7.6.1 Reference Color Bar Pattern\nThe reference color bar patterns are based on the pattern defined in Appendix D of the mipi_CTS_for_D-\nPHY_v1-1_r03 specification. The pattern is an 8-color bar pattern designed to provide high, low, and medium\nfrequency outputs on the CSI-2 transmit data lanes.DS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nThe CSI-2 reference pattern provides 8 color bars by default with the following byte data for the color bars: X\nbytes of 0xAA (high-frequency pattern, inverted), X bytes of 0x33 (mid-frequency pattern), X bytes of 0xF0 (low-\nfrequency pattern, inverted), X bytes of 0x7F (lone 0 pattern), X bytes of 0x55 (high-frequency pattern), X bytes\nof 0xCC (mid-frequency pattern, inverted), X bytes of 0x0F (low-frequency pattern), and Y bytes of 0x80 (long 1\npattern). In most cases, Y will be the same as X. For certain data types, the last color bar may need to be larger\nthan the others to properly fill the video line dimensions.\nThe pattern generator is programmable with the following options:\n• Number of color bars (1, 2, 4, or 8)\n• Number of bytes per line\n• Number of bytes per color bar\n• CSI-2 datatype field and VC-ID\n• Number of active video lines per frame\n• Number of total lines per frame (active plus blanking)\n• Line period (possibly program in units of 10 ns)\n• Vertical front porch – number of blank lines prior to the FrameEnd packet\n• Vertical back porch – number of blank lines following the FrameStart packet\nThe pattern generator relies on proper programming by software to ensure the color bar widths are set to\nmultiples of the block (or word) size required for the specified datatype. For example, for RGB888, the block size\nis 3 bytes which also matches the pixel size. In this case, the number of bytes per color bar must be a multiple of\n3. The pattern generator is implemented in the CSI-2 transmit clock domain, providing the pattern directly to the\nCSI-2 transmitter. The circuit generates the CSI-2 formatted data.\n7.6.2 Fixed Color Patterns\nWhen programmed for fixed color pattern mode, the pattern generator can generate a video image with a\nprogrammable fixed data pattern. The basic programming fields for image dimensions are the same as used with\nthe color bar patterns. When sending fixed color patterns, the color bar controls allow the user to alternate\nbetween the fixed pattern data and the bit-wise inverse of the fixed pattern data.\nThe fixed color patterns assume a fixed block size for the byte pattern. The block size is programmable through\na register and is designed to support most 8-bit, 10-bit, and 12-bit pixel formats. The block size should be set\nbased on the pixel size converted to blocks that are an integer multiple of bytes. For example, an RGB888\npattern would consist of 3-byte pixels and would therefore require a 3-byte block size. A 2x12-bit pixel image\nwould also require 3-byte block size, while a 3x12-bit pixel image would require 9 bytes (2 pixels) to send an\ninteger number of bytes. Sending a RAW10 pattern typically requires a 5-byte block size for 4 pixels, so 1x10-bit\nand 2x10-bit could both be sent with a 5-byte block size. For 3x10-bit, a 15-byte block size would be required.\nThe fixed color patterns support block sizes up to 16 bytes in length, allowing additional options for patterns in\nsome conditions. For example, an RGB888 image could alternate between four different pixels by using a\ntwelve-byte block size. An alternating black and white RGB888 image could be sent with a block size of 6-bytes\nby setting the first three bytes to 0xFF and the next three bytes to 0x00.\nTo support up to 16-byte block sizes, a set of sixteen registers are implemented to allow programming the value\nfor each data byte.\n7.6.3 Packet Generator Programming\nThe information in this section provides details on how to program the pattern generator to provide a specific\ncolor bar pattern, based on datatype, frame size, and line size.\nMost basic configuration information is determined directly from the expected video frame parameters. The\nrequirements should include the datatype, frame rate (frames per second), number of active lines per frame,\nnumber of total lines per frame (active plus blanking), and number of pixels per line.\n• PGEN_ACT_LPF – Number of active lines per frame\n• PGEN_TOT_LPF – Number of total lines per framewww.ti.comDS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\n• PGEN_LSIZE – Video line length size in bytes. Compute based on pixels per line multiplied by pixel size in\nbytes\n• CSI-2 DataType field and VC-ID.\n• Optional: PGEN_VBP – Vertical back porch. This is the number of lines of vertical blanking following Frame\nValid.\n• Optional: PGEN_VFP – Vertical front porch. This is the number of lines of vertical blanking preceding Frame\nValid.\n• PGEN_LINE_PD – Line period in 10-ns units. Compute based on Frame Rate and total lines per frame.\n• PGEN_BAR_SIZE – Color bar size in bytes. Compute based on datatype and line length in bytes (see details\nbelow).\n7.6.3.1 Determining Color Bar Size\nThe color bar pattern should be programmed in units of a block or word size dependent on the datatype of the\nvideo being sent. The sizes are defined in the MIPI CSI-2 specification. For example, RGB888 requires a 3-byte\nblock size which is the same as the pixel size. RAW10 requires a 5-byte block size which is equal to 4 pixels.\nRAW12 requires a 3-byte block size which is equal to 2 pixels.\nWhen programming the Pattern Generator, software should compute the required bar size in bytes based on the\nline size and the number of bars. For the standard 8-color bar pattern, that would require the following algorithm:\n• Select the desired datatype, and a valid length for that datatype (in pixels).\n• Convert pixels/line to blocks/line (by dividing by the number of pixels/block, as defined in the datatype\nspecification).\n• Divide the blocks/line result by the number of color bars (8), giving blocks/bar.\n• Round result down to the nearest integer.\n• Convert blocks/bar to bytes/bar and program that value into the PGEN_BAR_SIZE register.\nAs an alternative, the blocks/line can be computed by converting pixels/line to bytes/line and dividing by bytes/\nblock.DS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.6.4 Code Example for Pattern Generator\n#Patgen RGB888 1920x1080p30 Fixed 8 Colorbar \nWriteI2C(0xB0,0x00) # Indirect Pattern Gen Registers\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x01) # PGEN_CTL\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x01)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x02) # PGEN_CFG\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x33)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x03) # PGEN_CSI_DI\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x24) # RGB888\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x04) # PGEN_LINE_SIZE1\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x16)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x05) # PGEN_LINE_SIZE0 \nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x80)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x06) # PGEN_BAR_SIZE1\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x02)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x07) # PGEN_BAR_SIZE0\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0xD0)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x08) # PGEN_ACT_LPF1\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x04)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x09) # PGEN_ACT_LPF0\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x38)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0A) # PGEN_TOT_LPF1\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x04)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0B) # PGEN_TOT_LPF0\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x65)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0C) # PGEN_LINE_PD1\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x0B)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0D) # PGEN_LINE_PD0\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x93)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0E) # PGEN_VBP\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x21)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0F) # PGEN_VFP\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x0A)www.ti.comDS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\n7.7 Register Maps\nIn the register definitions under the TYPE  and DEFAULT  heading, the following definitions apply:\n• R = Read only access\n• R/W = Read / Write access\n• R/RC = Read only access, Read to Clear\n• (R/W)/SC = Read / Write access, Self-Clearing bit\n• (R/W)/S = Read / Write access, Set based on strap pin configuration at start-up\n• LL = Latched Low and held until read\n• LH = Latched High and held until read\n• S = Set based on strap pin configuration at start-up\n7.7.1 I2C Device ID Register\nTable 7-11.

Register access is provided through an indirect access mechanism\nthrough the Indirect Access registers (IND_ACC_CTL, IND_ACC_ADDR, and IND_ACC_DATA). These registers\nare located at offsets 0xB0-0xB2 in the main register space.\nThe indirect address mechanism involves setting the control register to select the desired block, setting the\nregister offset address, and reading or writing the data register. In addition, an auto-increment function is\nprovided in the control register to automatically increment the offset address following each read or write of the\ndata register.\nFor writes, the process is as follows:\n1. Write to the IND_ACC_CTL register to select the desired register block\n2. Write to the IND_ACC_ADDR register to set the register offset\n3. Write the data value to the IND_ACC_DATA register\nIf auto-increment is set in the IND_ACC_CTL register, repeating step 3 writes additional data bytes to\nsubsequent register offset locations.\nFor reads, the process is as follows:\n1. Write to the IND_ACC_CTL register to select the desired register block\n2. Write to the IND_ACC_ADDR register to set the register offset\n3. Read from the IND_ACC_DATA register\nIf auto-increment is set in the IND_ACC_CTL register, repeating step 3 reads additional data bytes from\nsubsequent register offset locations.\nTable 7-143.

TI’s customers are responsible for determining\nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe link between the DS90UB953-Q1 and the companion deserializer has two distinct data paths. The first path\nis a forward channel which is nominally running at up to 4.16 Gbps and is encoded such that the channel\noccupies a bandwidth from 20 MHz to 2.1 GHz. The second path is a back channel from the deserializer to the\nserializer which occupies a frequency range nominally from 10 MHz to 50 MHz.\nFor these two communications links to operate properly, the circuit between the serializer and the deserializer\nmust present a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω. Deviations from this 50- Ω characteristic will lead to signal\nreflections either at the serializer or deserializer, which will result in bit errors.\n8.1.1 Power-over-Coax\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  is designed to support the Power-over-Coax (PoC) method of powering remote sensor\nsystems. With this method, the power is delivered over the same medium (a coaxial cable) used for high-speed\ndigital video data, bidirectional control, and diagnostics data transmission. This method uses passive networks or\nfilters that isolate the transmission line from the loading of the DC-DC regulator circuits and their connecting\npower traces on both sides of the link as shown in Figure 8-1 .\nPower\nSource\nBraided\nShieldCoaxial CablePoC PoC\nFPD-Link IIIPOWER\nRTERMCAC1DC-DC \nRegulators\nCAC2CAC1\nCAC2\nRTERMSensor Module\nImage SensorAutomotive ECU\nFPD-Link III\nDeserializerFPD-Link III\nSerializerProcessor\nSoC\nFigure 8-1. Power-over-Coax (PoC) System Diagram\nThe PoC network impedance of ≥ 2 kΩ over a specific frequency band is typically sufficient to isolate the\ntransmission line from the loading of the regulator circuits. The lower limit of the frequency band is defined as ½\nof the frequency of the bidirectional control channel\' (f BCC). The upper limit of the frequency band is the\nfrequency of the forward high-speed channel (f FC).\nFigure 8-2  shows an example PoC network suitable for a "4G" FPD-Link III consisting of DS90UB953-Q1 and\nDS90UB954-Q1  or DS90UB960-Q1 pair with the bidirectional channel operating at 50 Mbps (½ f BCC = 25 MHz)\nand the forward channel operating at 4.16 Gbps (fFC ≈ 2.1 GHz). Other PoC networks are possible and may be\ndifferent on the serializer and the deserializer boards as long as the printed-circuit board return loss\nrequirements listed in Table 8-2  are met.DS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n66 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nVPoC\nL1C1\nFB3\nFB2\nFB10.1 PFC2\nR2DOUT+\nDOUT-CAC1\nCAC233 nF to 100 nF\n15 nF to 47 nF 49.9 :4.02 k:R1\n10 PH> 10 PFFigure 8-2.

Route the high-speed trace through one of its pads to avoid stubs.\n•Use the smallest component pads as allowed by manufacturer\'s design rules. Add anti-pads in the inner\nplanes below the component pads to minimize impedance drop.\n•Consult with the connector manufacturer for optimized connector footprint. If the connector is mounted on the\nsame side as the IC, minimize the impact of the through-hole connector stubs by routing the high-speed\nsignal traces on the opposite side of the connector mounting side.\n•Use coupled 100- Ω differential signal traces from the device pins to the AC-coupling caps. Use 50- Ω single-\nended traces from the AC-coupling capacitors to the connector.www.ti.comDS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 67\n• Terminate the inverting signal traces close to the connectors with standard 49.9-Ω resistors.\nThe suggested characteristics for single-ended PCB traces (microstrips or striplines) for serializer or deserializer\nboards are listed in Table 8-2 .

The next sections highlight\nrecommendations for the critical device pins.\n8.2.2.1 CSI-2 Interface\nThe CSI-2 input port on the DS90UB953-Q1  is compliant with the MIPI D-PHY v1.2 and CSI-2 v1.3\nspecifications. The CSI-2 interface consists of a clock and an option of one, two, or four data lanes. The clock\nand each of the data lanes are differential lines. The DS90UB953-Q1  CSI-2 input must be DC-coupled to a\ncompatible CSI-2 transmitter. Follow the PCB layout guidelines given in Section 10.1.1 .\n8.2.2.2 FPD-Link III Input / Output\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  serial data out signal operates at different data rates depending upon the mode in which\nthe device is operating. In synchronous mode, where the reference clock is provided by the deserializer, the\nserial data rate is up to 4.16 Gbps.www.ti.comDS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 71\nThe signals at DOUT+ and DOUT– must be AC-coupled. The AC-coupling capacitor values used on DOUT+ and\nDOUT– depends on the mode and cable used as shown in Table 8-3 . When connecting to a coax cable, the AC-\ncoupling capacitor on the negative terminal (DOUT–) should be approximately ½ of the AC-coupling capacitor\nvalue on DOUT+ and be terminated to a 50- Ω load. Make sure to follow the critical PCB layout guidelines given\nin Section 10.2  .\n8.2.2.3 Internal Regulator Bypassing\nThe DS90UB953-Q1  features three internal regulators that must be bypassed to GND. The VDDD_CAP,\nVDDDRV_CAP, and VDDPLL_CAP are the pins that expose the outputs of the internal regulators for bypassing.\nTI recommends that each pin has a 10-µF, 0.1-µF, and a 0.01-µF capacitor to GND. The 0.01-µF caps must be\nplaced as close as practical to the bypass pins.\n8.2.2.4 Loop Filter Decoupling\nThe LPF1 and LPF2 pins are for connecting filter capacitors to the internal PLL circuits. LPF1 should have a\n0.022-µF capacitor connected to the VDD_PLL pin (pin 11). The capacitor connected between LPF1 and\nVDDPLL must enclose as small of a loop as possible. LPF2 must have a 0.1-µF capacitor connecting the pin to\nGND. One of these PLLs generates the high-speed clock used in the serialization of the output, while the other\nPLL is used in the CSI-2 receive port. Noise coupled into these pins degrades the performance of the PLLs in\nthe DS90UB953-Q1 , so the caps must be placed close to the pins they are connected to, and the area of the\nloop enclosed must be minimized.\n8.2.3 Application Curve\nThe falling edge of the blue trace indicates that the device should shift from LP to HS mode – the rise that comes\nabout one division later is when the DS90UB953-Q1  turns on the internal termination so the device is ready to\nreceive HS data. The transitions are the CSI-2 data, and then the drop of the blue trace indicates that the\ntermination has been turned off.\nFigure 8-7.

This is done to isolate\nswitching noise effects between different sections of the circuit. Separate planes on the PCB are typically not\nrequired. The Section 5 section provides guidance on which circuit blocks are connected to which power pin\npairs. In some cases, an external filter many be used to provide clean power to sensitive circuits such as PLLs.\n9.1 Power-Up Sequencing\nThe power-up sequence for the DS90UB953-Q1 is as follows:\nVDD18\nT0\nPDBHard \nResetT1 T3T2\nFigure 9-1.

When synchronous\nclocking mode is selected, the serializer will relock onto the extracted back channel reference clock when\navailable, so there is no need for local crystal oscillator at the sensor module. The initialization sequence follows\nthe illustration given in the Initialization Sequence: Synchronous Clocking Mode.www.ti.comDS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 73\nLOCKDES Back \nChannel\nDOUT+PoC \nSupply\nI2C\nLocalT4VDD18\nPDB\nSensor \nConfig\nI2C \nRemote\nDES \nconfig\nSensor \nCSI-2 Valid \nImageDES Lock TimeMODE, \nIDX Valid\nPass \nthrough953 \nConfig\nCLKOUTFigure 9-2. Initialization Sequence: Synchronous Clocking Mode\n9.2 Power Down (PDB)\nThe Serializer has a PDB input pin to ENABLE or POWER DOWN the device. This pin may be controlled by an\nexternal device, or through VDD where VDD = 1.71 V to 1.89 V. PDB should be brought high after all power\nsupplies on the board have stabilized.\nWhen PDB is driven low, ensure that the pin is driven to 0 V for at least 3 ms before releasing or driving high. In\nthe case where PDB is pulled up to VDD directly, a 10-k Ω pullup resistor and a > 1- μF capacitor to ground are\nrequired.\nToggling PDB low powers down the device and resets all control registers to default. After power up, if there are\nany errors seen, TI recommends clearing the registers to reset the errors.\nMake sure to power up the VDDDRV before or at the same time as the VDDPLL.DS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n74 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nCircuit board layout and stack-up for the FPD-Link III devices must be designed to provide low-noise power feed\nto the device. Good layout practice also separates high-frequency or high-level inputs and outputs to minimize\nunwanted stray noise pickup, feedback, and interference. External bypassing should be low-ESR ceramic\ncapacitors with high-quality dielectric. The voltage rating of the ceramic capacitors must be at least 2× the power\nsupply voltage being used.\nTI recommends surface-mount capacitors due to their smaller parasitics. When using multiple capacitors per\nsupply pin, place the smaller value closest to the pin. A large bulk capacitor is recommend at the point of power\nentry. This is typically in the 47-µF to 100-µF range, which smooths low-frequency switching noise. TI\nrecommends connecting power and ground pins directly to the power and ground planes with bypass capacitors\nconnected to the plane. TI also recommends that the user place a via on both ends of the capacitors.\nConnecting power or ground pins to an external bypass capacitor increases the inductance of the path.\nA small body size X7R chip capacitor, such as 0603 or 0402, is recommended for external bypass. The small\nbody size reduces the parasitic inductance of the capacitor. The user must pay attention to the resonance\nfrequency of these external bypass capacitors, usually in the range of 20 to 30 MHz. To provide effective\nbypassing, multiple capacitors are often used to achieve low impedance between the supply rails over the\nfrequency of interest. At high frequency, it is also common practice to use two vias from power and ground pins\nto the planes, reducing the impedance at high frequency.\nSome devices provide separate power and ground pins for different portions of the circuit. This is done to isolate\nswitching noise effects between different sections of the circuit. Separate planes on the PCB are typically not\nrequired. Pin description tables typically provide guidance on which circuit blocks are connected to which power\npin pairs (see Section 5 for more information). In some cases, an external filter may be used to provide clean\npower to sensitive circuits such as PLLs.\nUse at least a four-layer board with a dedicated ground plane. Place CSI-2 signals away from the single-ended\nor differential FPD-Link III RX input traces to prevent coupling from the CSI-2 lines to the Rx input lines. A single-\nended impedance of 50 Ω is typically recommended for coaxial interconnect, and a differential impedance of 100\nΩ is typically recommended for STP interconnect. The closely coupled lines help to ensure that coupled noise\nappears as common-mode and thus is rejected by the receivers. The tightly coupled lines also radiate less.\n10.1.1 CSI-2 Guidelines\n1. Route CSI0_D*P/N pairs with controlled 100-Ω differential impedance (±20%) or 50-Ω single-ended\nimpedance (±15%).\n2. Keep away from other high-speed signals.\n3. Keep the length difference between a differential pair to 5 mils of each other.\n4. Make sure that length matching is near the location of mismatch.\n5. Match trace lengths between the clock pair and each data pair to be < 25 mils.\n6. Separate each pair by at least 3 times the signal trace width.\n7. Keep the use of bends in differential traces to a minimum. When bends are used, the number of left and right\nbends must be as equal as possible, and the angle of the bend should be ≥ 135 degrees. This arrangement\nminimizes any length mismatch caused by the bends and therefore minimizes the impact that bends have on\nEMI.\n8. Route all differential pairs on the same layer to help match trace impedance characteristics.\n9. Keep the number of VIAS to a minimum—TI recommends keeping the VIA count to two or fewer.\n10.Keep traces on layers adjacent to ground plane.\n11.Do NOT route differential pairs over any plane split.www.ti.comDS90UB953-Q1\nSNLS552C – SEPTEMBER 2017 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 75\nNote\nAdding test points can cause impedance discontinuity and therefore negatively impacts signal\nperformance. If test points are used, place them in series and symmetrically. Test points must not be\nplaced in a manner that causes a stub on the differential pair.\n10.2 Layout Examples\nThe board layout for the DS90UB953-Q1EVM is shown in Figure 10-1  and Figure 10-2 . All EVM layers are\nincluded in DS90UB953-Q1EVM user\'s guide  (SNLU224).\nRouting the FPD-Link III signal traces between the DOUT pins and the connector, as well as connecting the PoC\nfilter to these traces, are the most critical pieces of a successful DS90UB953-Q1  PCB layout. The following list\nprovides essential recommendations for routing the FPD-Link III signal traces between the driver output pins and\nthe FAKRA connector, as well as connecting the PoC filter.\n•The routing of the FPD-Link III traces may be all on the top layer or partially embedded in middle layers if EMI\nis a concern.\n•The AC-coupling capacitors should be on the top layer and very close to the receiver input pins to minimize\nthe length of coupled differential trace pair between the pins and the capacitors.\n•Route the DOUT+ trace between the AC-coupling capacitor and the FAKRA connector as a 50- Ω single-\nended micro-strip with tight impedance control (±10%). Calculate the proper width of the trace for a 50- Ω\nimpedance based on the PCB stack-up. Ensure that the trace can carry the PoC current for the maximum\nload presented by the remote sensor module.\n•The PoC filter should be connected to the DOUT+ trace through the ferrite bead or an RF inductor. The ferrite\nbead should be touching the high-speed trace to minimize the stub length seen by the transmission line.\nCreate an anti-pad or a moat under the ferrite bead pad that touches the trace. The anti-pad should be a\nplane cutout of the ground plane directly underneath the top layer without cutting out the ground reference\nunder the trace. The purpose of the anti-pad is to maintain the impedance as close to 50 Ω as possible.\n•When routing DOUT+ on inner layers, length matching for single-ended traces does not provide a significant\nbenefit. If the user wants to route the DOUT+ on the top or bottom layer, route the DOUT– trace loosely\ncoupled to the DOUT+ trace for the length similar to the DOUT+ trace length. This may help the differential\nnature of the receiver to cancel out any common-mode noise that may be present in the environment that\nmay couple on to the signal traces.\nBuried FPD-Link III \nHigh-speed Trace \non Signal Layer 1AC-Coupling \nCapacitor on \nTop Layer\nFigure 10-1.
