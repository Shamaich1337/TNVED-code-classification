The parts operate from a single 2.7 V to 5.25 V power \nsupply and feature throughput rates up to 1  MSPS. The parts \ncontain a low noise, wide bandwidth track -and-hold amplifier  that \ncan handle input frequencies in excess of 8 MHz.  \nThe conversion process and data acquisition are controlled using \nCS and the serial clock signal, allowing the device to easily interface \nwith microprocessors or DSPs. The input signal  is sampled on the \nfalling edge of  CS and conversion is also initiated at this point. \nThere are no pipeline delays associated with the part.  \nThe AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928  use advance d design techniques to \nachieve very low power dissipation at maximum throughput rates. \nAt maximum throughput rates, the AD7908 /AD7918/ AD7928 \nconsume 2 mA maximum with 3 V supplies; with 5 V supplies, the current consumption is 2.7 mA maximum.  \nThrough the configuration of the control register , the analog input \nrange for the part can be selected as 0 V to REF\nIN or 0 V to 2 × \nREF IN, with either straight binary or twos complement output \ncoding. The AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 each feature eight single -\nended analog inputs with a channel sequencer to allow a preprogrammed selection of channels to be converted sequentially.  \nThe conversion time for the AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928 is \ndetermined by the SCLK frequency, which is also used as the master clock to control the conversion.

High Throughput with Low Power Consumption.  The AD7908 / \nAD7918/ AD7928  offer up to 1 MSPS throughput rates. At the \nmaximum throughput rate with 3 V supplies, the AD7908 / \nAD7918/ AD7928  dissipate just 6 mW of power maximum.  \n2. Eight Single -Ended Inputs with a Channel Sequencer.   \nA sequence of c hannels can be selected, thro ugh which  \nthe ADC  cycle s and convert s on. \n3. Single -Supply Opera tion with V DRIVE Function.  The AD7908/  \nAD7918/ AD7928  operate from a single 2.7 V to 5.25 V supply. \nThe V DRIVE function allows the serial interface to connect directly \nto either 3 V or 5 V process or systems independent of AV DD. \n4. Flexible Power/Serial Clock Speed Management. The conversion \nrate is determined by the serial clock, allowing the conversion time to be reduced through the serial clock speed increase. The parts also feature various shutdown  modes to maximize power \nefficiency at lower throughput ra tes. Current consumption is \n0.5 μA max when in full shutdown.  \n5. No Pipeline Delay.  The parts feature a standard successive \napproximation ADC with accurate control of the sampling \ninstant via a \nCS input and once off conversion control.  \nAD7908/AD7918/AD7928 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

This clock input is also \nused as the c lock source for the conversion process  of the AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928 . \n2  DIN  Data In.  Logic input. Data to be written to the control register of the  AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928  is provided on \nthis input and is clocked into the register on the falling edge of SCLK (see the Control Register  section).  \n3  CS Chip Select. Active low logic input. This inp ut provides the dual function of initiating conversions on the \nAD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928 , and also frames the serial data transfer.  \n4, 8, 17, 20  AGND  Analog Ground. This is the g round reference po int for all analog circuitry on the AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928 . All \nanalog input signals and any external reference signal should be referred to this AGND voltage. All AGND pins \nshould be connected tog ether.  \n5, 6  AV DD  Analog Power Supply Input. The AV DD range for the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928  is from 2.7 V to 5.25 V. For the 0 V \nto 2 ×  REF IN range, AV DD should be from 4.75 V to 5.25 V.  \n7  REF IN  Reference Input for the AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928 . An external reference must be applied to this input. The \nvoltage range for the external reference is 2.5 V ± 1% for specified performance.  \n16 to 9  VIN0 to VIN7  Analog I nput 0 through Analog Input 7. These are e ight single -ended analog input channels that are \nmultiplexed  into the on -chip track -and -hold. The analog input channel to be converted is selected by using \nAddress Bit  ADD2 through  Addres s Bit  ADD0 of the control  register. The address bits, in conjunction with the \nSEQ and SHADOW bits, allow the s equencer to be programmed. The input range for all input channels  can \nextend from 0 V to REF IN or 0 V to 2 ×  REF IN as selected via the RANGE bit i n the control register . Any unused \ninput channels must be connected to AGND to avoid noise pickup .  \n18  DOUT  Data Out. Logic output. The conversion result from the AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928  is provi ded on this output as a \nserial data stream. The bits are clocked out on the falling edge of the SCLK input. The data stream from the \nAD7908  consists of one leading zero, three address bits indicating which channel the conversion result \ncorresponds to, followed by the eight bits of conversion data, followed by four trail ing zeros, provided MSB \nfirst; the data stream from the AD7918  consists of one leading zero, three address bits indicating which \nchannel the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the 10 bits of conversion data, followed by two \ntrailing zeros, also provided MSB first; the data stream from the AD7928  consists of one leading zero, three \naddress bits indicating which channel the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the 12 bits of \nconversion data, provided MSB first. The output coding can  be selected as straight bi nary or twos complement \nvia the  CODING  bit in the control register .  \n19  VDRIVE  Logic Power Supply Input.

E | Page 12 of 28 TERMINOLOGY  \nIntegral Nonlinearity  \nThis is the maximum deviation from a str aight line passing \nthrough the endpoints of the ADC transfer function. The \nendpoints of the transfer function are zero sc ale, a position  1 LSB \nbelow the first code tra nsition, and full scale, a position  1 LSB \nabove the last code transition . \nDifferential No nlinearity  \nThis is the difference between the measured and the ideal 1 LSB \nchange between any two adjacent codes in the ADC.  \nOffset Error  \nThis is the deviation of the first code transition (00 . . . 000) to (00 . . . 001) from the ideal, that is, AGND + 1 LSB.  \nOffset Error Match  \nThis is the difference in offset error between any two channels.  \nGain Error  \nThis is the deviation of the last code transition (111 . . . 110) to \n(111 . . . 111) from the ideal (that is , REF\nIN – 1 LSB) after the \noffset error has been  adjusted out.  \nGain Error Match  \nThis is the difference in gain error between any two channels.  \nZero Code Error  \nThis applies when using the twos complement output coding \noption , in particular to the 2 × REF IN input range with − REF IN \nto +REF IN biased about t he REF IN point. It is the deviation of the \nmidscale transition (all 0s to all 1s) from the ideal V IN voltage, \nthat is , REF IN − 1 LSB.  \nZero Code Error Match  \nThis is the difference in zero code error between any two \nchannels.  \nPositive Gain Error  \nThis applies  when using the twos complement output coding \noption, in particular to the 2 × REF IN input range with − REF IN \nto +REF IN biased about the REF IN point. It is the deviation of the \nlast code transition (011. . .110) to (011 . . . 111) from the ideal \n(that is , +REF IN − 1 LSB) after the z ero code error has been \nadjusted out.  \nPositive Gain Error Match  \nThis is the difference in p ositive gain error between any two \nchannels.  \nNegative Gain Error  \nThis applies when using the twos complement output coding option, in parti cular to the 2 × REF\nIN input range with − REF IN \nto +REF IN biased about the REF IN point. It is the deviation of the \nfirst code transition (100 . . . 000) to (1 00 . . . 001) from the ideal \n(that is , −REF IN + 1 LSB) after the  zero code error has been \nadjusted out. Negative Gain Error Match  \nThis is the difference in n egative gain error between any two \nchannels.  \nChannel -to-Channel Isolation  \nChannel -to-channel isolation is a measure of the level of \ncrosstalk between channels. It is measured by applying a full-scale 400 kHz sine wave signal to all seven nonselected input \nchannels and determining how much that signal is attenuated  in the selected channel with a 50 kHz signal. The figure is given worst case across all eight channels for the AD7908/ AD7918/  \nAD7928.  \nPower Supply Rejection  (PSR ) \nVariations in power supply affect the full -scale transition, but \nnot the converter ’s linearity . Power supply rejection is the \nmaximum change in full -scale transition poi nt due to a change \nin power -supply voltage from the nominal value (s ee the \nPerformance Curves  section ). \nTrack -and-Hold Acquisition Time  \nThe tra ck-and-hold amplifier returns to track mode at the end \nof conversion. Track -and-hold ac quisition time is the time \nrequired for the output of the track -and-hold amplifier to reach \nits final value, within ± 1 LSB, after the end of conversion.  \nSignal -to-(Noise + Distortion) Ratio  \nThis is the measured ratio of signal -to-(noise + distor tion) at \nthe output of the ADC . The signal is the rms amplitude of the \nfundamental. Noise is the sum of all nonfundamental signals up to half the sampling frequency (f\nS/2), excluding dc. The ratio is \ndependent on the number of quantization levels in the \ndigitization process; the more levels, the smaller the \nquantization noise. The theoretical signal -to-(noise + \ndistortion) ratio for an ideal N -bit converter with a sine wave \ninput is given by  \nSignal -to-(Noise  + Distortion ) = (6.02N  + 1.76) dB \nThus for a 12- bit converter , this is 74 dB; for a 10 -bit converter, \nthis is 62 dB; and for an 8 -bit converter, this is 50 dB.  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion  \nTotal harmonic distortion (THD) is the ratio of the rms sum of \nharmon ics to the fundamental. For the AD7908/ AD7918 / \nAD7928, it is defined as: \n()\n12\n62\n52\n42\n32\n2\nlog20VV V V V V\ndB THD++++\n=  \nwhere V1 is the rms amplitude of the fundamental and V2, V3, \nV4, V5, and V 6 are the rms amplitudes of the second through the \nsixth harmonics.  \n \nData Sheet AD7908/AD7918/AD7928\n \nRev. E | Page 13 of 28 TYPICAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS \nPERFORMANCE CURVES \nFigure 4 shows a typical FFT plot for the AD7928 at 1 MSPS \nsample rate and 50 kHz input frequency. Figure 5 shows the \nsignal-to-(noise + distortion) ratio performance vs. input frequency for various supply voltages while sampling at 1 MSPS with an SCLK of 20 MHz. \nFigure 6 shows the power supply rejection ratio vs. supply ripple \nfrequency for the AD7928 when no decoupling is used. The \npower supply rejection ratio is defined as the ratio of the power \nin the ADC output at full-scale frequency f, to the power of a \n200 mV p-p sine wave applied to the ADC AV\nDD supply of \nfrequency f S \nPSRR(dB) = 10 log( Pf/Pfs) \nPf is equal to the power at frequency f in ADC output; Pf S is \nequal to the power at frequency f S coupled onto the ADC AV DD \nsupply.

Data is loaded from the DIN pin of the \nAD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 on the falling edge of SCLK. The data is transferred on the DIN line at the same time that the conversion result \nis read from the part. The data transferred on the DIN li ne corresponds to the AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928 configuration for the next \nconversion. This requires 16 serial clocks for every data transfer. Only the information provided on the first 12 falling clo ck edges (after \nCS falling edge) is loaded to the c ontrol  register. MSB denotes the first bit in the data stream. The bit functions are outlined in Table 7. \nMSB            LSB  \nWRITE  SEQ  DON ’TCARE  ADD2  ADD1  ADD0  PM1 PM0  SHADOW  DON ’TCARE  RANGE  CODING  \nTable 7.

These two bits decode the mode of operation of the AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928  as shown in \nTable 9. \n3  SHADOW  The SHADOW bit in the c ontrol register  is used in conjunction with the SEQ bit to control the use of the sequencer \nfunction and access the SHADOW r egister (see Table 10).  \n2  DON’T CARE   \n1  RANGE  This bit selects the analog input range to be used on the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 . If it is set to  0, the analog input \nrange extend s from 0 V to 2 × REF IN. If it is set to  1, the analog input range extend s from 0 V to REF IN (for the next \nconversion). For 0 V to 2 × REF IN, AV DD = 4.75 V to 5.25 V.  \n0  CODING  This bit selects the type of output codin g the AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928  uses for the conversion result. If this bit is set to \n0, the ou tput coding for the part is  twos complement. If this bit is set to 1, the out put coding from the part is  straight \nbinary (for the next conversion).  \nTable 8.

In this mode, the AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928  automatically enters full shutdown mode at the end of each \nconversion when the control register is updated.

This configuration is not allowed.  \nSEQUENCER OPERATION  \nThe configuration of the SEQ and SHADOW bits in the c ontrol register allows the user to select a particular mode of operation of the \nsequencer function. Table 10 outlines the four modes of operation of the s equencer.  \nTable 10. Sequence Selection  \nSEQ  SHADOW  Sequence Type  \n0  0  This configuration means that the sequence function is not used. The analog input channel selected for each individual \nconversion is determined by the contents of the ADD0 through ADD2  channel address bits in each prior write \noperation. This mode of operation r eflects the traditional operation of a multichannel ADC, without the s equencer \nfunction being used, where each write to the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928  selects t he next channel for conversion (s ee \nFigure 11). \n0  1  This configuration selects the SHADOW r egister for programming. The following write operation load s the contents of \nthe SHADOW r egister. This program s the sequence of channels to be converted on continuously with each successive \nvalid CS falling edge (s ee the SHADOW Register  section, SHADOW register bit map , and  Figure 12). The channels \nselected need not be consecutive.  \n1  0  If the SEQ and SHADOW  bits are set in this way, then the sequence function s are not  interrupted upon completion of \nthe write  operation. This allows other bits in the control register  to be altered between conversions while in a sequence, \nwithout terminating the cycle.  \n1  1  This configuration is used in conjunction with the ADD2 to  ADD0  channel address bits  to program continuous \nconversions on a consecutive sequence of channels from Channel 0 to a selected final channel as determined by the \nchannel address bits in the control  register (s ee Figure 13). \nData Sheet AD7908/AD7918/AD7928\n \nRev. E | Page 17 of 28 SHADOW REGISTER \nMSB LSB \nVIN0 VIN1 V IN2 VIN3 VIN4 VIN5 VIN6 VIN7 VIN0 VIN1 V IN2 V IN3 VIN4 VIN5 VIN6 VIN7 \nSequence One Sequence Two \nThe SHADOW register on the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 is a \n16-bit, write-only register. Data is loaded from the DIN pin of \nthe AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 on the falling edge of SCLK. The \ndata is transferred on the DIN line at the same time that a \nconversion result is read from the part. This requires 16 serial clock falling edges for the data transfer. The information is clocked into the SHADOW register, provided that the SEQ and \nSHADOW bits were set to 0,1, respectively, in the previous \nwrite to the control register. MSB denotes the first bit in the data stream. Each bit represents an analog input from Channel 0 to Channel 7. Through programming the SHADOW register, two sequences of channels can be selected, through which the \nAD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 cycle with each consecutive \nconversion after the write to the SHADOW register.  \nSequence One is performed first and then Sequence Two. If the \nuser does not wish to perform a second sequence option, then \nall 0s must be written to the last 8 LSBs of the SHADOW \nregister. To select a sequence of channels, the associated channel bit must be set for each analog input. The AD7908/ AD7918/ \nAD7928 continuously cycle through the selected channels in ascending order beginning with the lowest channel, until a \nwrite operation occurs (that is, the WRITE bit is set to 1) with \nthe SEQ and SHADOW bits configured in any way except 1, 0, (see Table 10). The bit functions are outlined in the SHADOW \nregister bit map. \nFigure 11 reflects the traditional operation of a multichannel \nADC, where each serial transfer selects the next channel for \nconversion. In this mode of operation the sequencer function is \nnot used. \nFigure 12 shows how to program the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928  \nto continuously convert on a particular sequence of channels. \nTo exit this mode of operation and revert back to the traditional mode of operation of a multichannel ADC (as outlined in \nFigure 11), ensure that the WRITE bit = 1 and the SEQ = \nSHADOW = 0 on the next serial transfer. Figure 13 shows how a sequence of consecutive channels can be converted on without having to program the SHADOW register or write to the part on each serial transfer. Again, to exit this mode of operation and revert back to the traditional mode of operation of a multichannel \nADC (as outlined in Figure 11), ensure the WRITE bit = 1 and \nthe SEQ = SHADOW = 0 on the next serial transfer.

The parts \ncan be operated from a 2.7 V to 5.25 V supply. When operated from either a 5 V or 3 V supply, the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 \nare capable of throughput rates of 1 MSPS when provided with \na 20 MHz clock. \nThe AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 provide the user with an on-\nchip, track-and-hold ADC, and a serial interface housed in a \n20-lead TSSOP package. The AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 each \nhave eight single-ended input channels with a channel sequencer, allowing the user to select a channel sequence that \nthe ADC can cycle through with each consecutive CS\n falling \nedge. The serial clock input accesses data from the part, controls \nthe transfer of data written to the ADC, and provides the clock source for the successive approximation ADC. The analog input range for the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 is 0 V to REF\nIN or 0 V to \n2 × REF IN, depending on the status of Bit 1 in the control \nregister. For the 0 to 2 × REF IN range, the part must be operated \nfrom a 4.75 V to 5.25 V supply. \nThe AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 provide flexible power \nmanagement options to allow the user to achieve the best power \nperformance for a given throughput rate. These options are selected by programming the PM1 and PM0 power \nmanagement bits in the control register. \n  \n CONVERTER OPERATION \nThe AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 are 8-, 10-, and 12-bit successive \napproximation analog-to-digital converters based around a \ncapacitive DAC, respectively. The AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 can \nconvert analog input signals in the range 0 V to REF IN or 0 V to \n2 × REF IN. Figure 14 and Figure 15 show simplified schematics \nof the ADC. The ADC is comprised of control logic, SAR, and a capacitive DAC, which are used to add and subtract fixed amounts of charge from the sampling capacitor to bring the comparator back into a balanced condition. Figure 14 shows the ADC during its acquisition phase. SW2 is closed and SW1 is in \nPosition A. The comparator is held in a balanced condition and \nthe sampling capacitor acquires the signal on the selected V\nIN \nchannel.  \nVIN7VIN0\nAGNDA\nBSW1\nSW2\nCOMPARATORCONTROL\nLOGIC4kΩCAPACITIVE DAC\n03089-014 \nFigure 14. ADC Acquisition Phase \nWhen the ADC starts a conversion (see Figure 15), SW2 opens \nand SW1 moves to Position B, causing the comparator to \nbecome unbalanced. The control logic and the capacitive DAC are used to add and subtract fixed amounts of charge from the \nsampling capacitor to bring the comparator back into a \nbalanced condition. When the comparator is rebalanced, the conversion is complete. The control logic generates the ADC output code.

ADC Conversion Phase \nAnalog Input \nFigure 16 shows an equivalent circuit of the analog input \nstructure of the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928. The two diodes (D1 \nand D2) provide ESD protection for the analog inputs. Care \nmust be taken to ensure that the analog input signal never \nexceeds the supply rails by more than 300 mV . This causes these \ndiodes to become forward biased and start conducting current into the substrate. 10 mA is the maximum current these diodes can conduct without causing irreversible damage to the part. The Capacitor C1 in Figure 16 is typically about 4 pF and can \nprimarily be attributed to pin capacitance. The Resistor R1 is a \nlumped component made up of the on resistance of the track-and-hold switch and also includes the on resistance of the input \nData Sheet AD7908/AD7918/AD7928\n \nRev. E | Page 19 of 28 multiplexer. The total resistance is typically about 400 Ω. The \nCapacitor C2 is the ADC sampling capacitor and has a capacitance of 30 pF typically. For ac applications, removing high frequency components from the analog input signal is \nrecommended by use of an RC lowpass filter on the relevant \nanalog input pin. In applications where harmonic distortion and signal-to-noise ratio are critical, the analog input should be driven from a low impedance source. Large source impedances significantly affect the ac performance of the ADC. This can \nnecessitate the use of an input buffer amplifier. The choice of \nthe op amp is a function of the particular application. \nWhen no amplifier is used to drive the analog input, the source \nimpedance should be limited to low values. The maximum \nsource impedance depends on the amount of total harmonic \ndistortion (THD) that can be tolerated. The THD increases as the source impedance increases, and performance degrades (see \nFigure 8). \nVIN\nC1\n4pFC2\n30pFR1D1\nD2AVDD\nCONVERSION PHASE: SWITCH OPEN\nTRACK PHASE: SWITCH CLOSED\n03089-016 \nFigure 16. Equivalent Analog Input Circuit \nADC TRANSFER FUNCTION \nThe output coding of the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 is either \nstraight binary or twos complement, depending on the status of \nthe LSB in the control register. The designed code transitions \noccur at successive LSB values (that is, 1 LSB, 2 LSBs, and so on).

In this setup, the AGND pin is \nconnected to the analog ground plane of the system. In Figure 20, \nREF IN is connected to a decoupled 2.5 V supply from a reference \nsource, the AD780, to provide an analog input range of 0 V to \n2.5 V (if RANGE bit is 1) or 0 V to 5 V (if RANGE bit is 0). \nAlthough the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 is connected to a V DD of \n5 V , the serial interface is connected to a 3 V microprocessor. The V\nDRIVE  pin of the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928  is connected to \nthe same 3 V supply of the microprocessor to allow a 3 V logic \ninterface (see the Digital Inputs section). The conversion result \nis output in a 16-bit word. This 16-bit data stream consists of a leading zero, three address bits indicating which channel the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the 12 bits of conversion data for the AD7928  (10 bits of data for the AD7918 \nand 8 bits of data for the AD7908, each followed by two and \nfour trailing zeros, respectively). For applications where power consumption is of concern, the power-down modes should be used between conversions or bursts of several conversions to improve power performance (see the Modes of Operation \nsection). \n \nAD7908/AD7918/AD7928 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Typical Connection Diagram \nAnalog Input Selection \nAny one of eight analog input channels can be selected for \nconversion by programming the multiplexer with the Address \nBit ADD2 to Address Bit ADD0 in the control register. The channel configurations are shown in Table 8. The AD7908/ \nAD7918/ AD7928  can also be configured to automatically cycle \nthrough a number of channels as selected. The sequencer feature is accessed via the SEQ and SHADOW bits in the \ncontrol register (see Table 10). \nThe AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 can be programmed to \ncontinuously convert on a selection of channels in ascending \norder. The analog input channels to be converted on are selected through programming the relevant bits in the SHADOW register (see the SHADOW Register section). The \nnext serial transfer then acts on the sequence programmed by \nexecuting a conversion on the lowest channel in the selection. The next serial transfer results in a conversion on the next \nhighest channel in the sequence, and so on. \nIt is not necessary to write to the control register once a \nsequencer operation has been initiated. The WRITE bit must be \nset to zero or the DIN line tied low to ensure the control register is not accidentally overwritten, or the sequence operation \ninterrupted. If the control register is written to at any time  during the sequence, then it must be ensured that the SEQ and \nSHADOW bits are set to 1, 0 to avoid interrupting the \nautomatic conversion sequence. This pattern continues until such time as the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 is written to and the \nSEQ and SHADOW bits are configured with any bit combination \nexcept 1, 0. On completion of the sequence, the AD7908/ \nAD7918/ AD7928  sequencer returns to the first selected channel \nin the SHADOW register and commence the sequence again. \nRather than selecting a particular sequence of channels, a \nnumber of consecutive channels beginning with Channel 0 can \nalso be programmed via the control register alone, without needing to write to the SHADOW register. This is possible if the SEQ and SHADOW bits are set to 1,1. The channel address bits ADD2 through ADD0 then determine the final channel in the \nconsecutive sequence. The next conversion is on Channel 0, \nthen Channel 1, and so on until the channel selected via the address bits ADD2 through ADD0 is reached. The cycle begins again on the next serial transfer, provided the WRITE bit is set to low, or if high, that the SEQ and SHADOW bits are set to \n1, 0; then the ADC continues its preprogrammed automatic \nsequence uninterrupted. \nRegardless of which channel selection method is used, the 16-bit \nword output from the AD7928 during each conversion always \ncontains a leading zero, three channel address bits that the \nconversion result corresponds to, followed by the 12-bit conversion result. The AD7918 outputs a leading zero, three \nchannel address bits that the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the 10-bit conversion result and two trailing zeros; \nthe AD7908 outputs a leading zero, three channel address bits \nthat the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the 8-bit \nconversion result and four trailing zeros. (See the Serial \nInterface section.) \nDigital Inputs \nThe digital inputs applied to the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 are \nnot limited by the maximum ratings that limit the analog \nData Sheet AD7908/AD7918/AD7928\n \nRev. E | Page 21 of 28 inputs. Instead, the digital inputs applied can go to 7 V and are \nnot restricted by the AV DD + 0.3 V limit as on the analog inputs. \nAnother advantage of SCLK, DIN, and CS not being restricted \nby the AV DD + 0.3 V limit is the fact that power supply \nsequencing issues are avoided. If CS, DIN, or SCLK are applied \nbefore AV DD, there is no risk of latch-up as there would be on \nthe analog inputs if a signal greater than 0.3 V was applied prior to AV\nDD. \nVDRIVE  \nThe AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 also have the V DRIVE  feature. \nVDRIVE  controls the voltage at which the serial interface operates. \nVDRIVE  allows the ADC to easily interface to both 3 V and 5 V \nprocessors. For example, if the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 were \noperated with an AV DD of 5 V , the V DRIVE  pin could be powered \nfrom a 3 V supply. The AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928  have better \ndynamic performance with an AV DD of 5 V while still being able \nto interface to 3 V processors. Care should be taken to ensure \nVDRIVE  does not exceed AV DD by more than 0.3 V . See the \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings section. \nReference \nAn external reference source should be used to supply the 2.5 V \nreference to the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928. Errors in the \nreference source results in gain errors in the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928  transfer function and adds to the specified \nfull-scale errors of the part. A capacitor of at least 0.1 μF should be placed on the REF\nIN pin. Suitable reference sources for the \nAD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 include the AD780, REF192, \nAD1582, ADR03, ADR381, ADR391, and ADR421. \nIf 2.5 V is applied to the REF IN pin, the analog input range can \neither be 0 V to 2.5 V or 0 V to 5 V , depending on the setting of \nthe RANGE bit in the control register. \nMODES OF OPERATION \nThe AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 have a number of different \nmodes of operation. These modes are designed to provide \nflexible power management options. These options can be \nchosen to optimize the power dissipation/throughput rate ratio for differing application requirements. The mode of operation of the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928  is controlled by the power \nmanagement bits, PM1 and PM0, in the control register, as \ndetailed in Table 9. When power supplies are first applied to the \nAD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928, care should be taken to ensure that \nthe part is placed in the required mode of operation (see \nPowering Up the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 section). \nNormal Mode (PM1 = PM0 = 1) \nThis mode is intended for the fastest throughput rate \nperformance, as the user does not have to worry about any \npower-up times with the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 remaining \nfully powered at all times. Figure 21 shows the general diagram \nof the operation of the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928  in this mode. The conversion is initiated on the falling edge of CS and the \ntrack-and-hold enters hold mode as described in the Serial \nInterface section. The data presented to the AD7908/ AD7918/ \nAD7928 on the DIN line during the first 12 clock cycles of the data transfer are loaded into the control register (provided WRITE bit is set to 1). If data is to be written to the SHADOW \nregister (SEQ = 0, SHADOW = 1 on previous write), data \npresented on the DIN line during the first 16 SCLK cycles is loaded into the SHADOW register. The part remains fully powered up in normal mode at the end of the conversion as long as PM1 and PM0 are both loaded with 1 on every data transfer. \nSixteen serial clock cycles are required to complete the \nconversion and access the conversion result. The track-and-\nhold goes back into track on the 14th SCLK falling edge. CS\n can \nthen idle high until the next conversion or can idle low until sometime prior to the next conversion, effectively idling CS\n low. \nOnce a data transfer is complete (DOUT has returned to three-\nstate), another conversion can be initiated after the quiet time, \ntQUIET , has elapsed by bringing CS low again. \n1 12CS\nSCLK\nDOUT\nDIN16\n1 LEADING ZERO + 3 CHANNEL\nIDENTIFIER BITS + CONVERSION RESULT\nNOTES\n1.

Normal Mode Operation \nFull Shutdown Mode (PM1 = 1, PM0 = 0) \nIn this mode, all internal circuitry on the AD7908/ AD7918/ \nAD7928 is powered down. The part retains information in the \ncontrol register during full shutdown. The AD7908/ AD7918/ \nAD7928 remains in full shutdown until the power management bits in the control register, PM1 and PM0, are changed. \nIf a write to the control register occurs while the part is in full \nshutdown, with the power management bits changed to PM0 = \nPM1 = 1, normal mode, the part begins to power up on the CS\n \nrising edge. The track-and-hold that was in hold while the part was \nin full shutdown returns to track on the 14th SCLK falling edge. \nTo ensure that the part is fully powered up, t POWER  UP, should \nhave elapsed before the next CS falling edge. Figure 22 shows \nthe general diagram for this sequence. \nAuto Shutdown Mode (PM1 = 0, PM0 = 1) \nIn this mode, the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 automatically \nenters shutdown at the end of each conversion when the control \nregister is updated. When the part is in shutdown, the track and hold is in hold mode. Figure 23 shows the general diagram of \nAD7908/AD7918/AD7928 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 22 of 28 the operation of the AD7908 /AD7918/ AD7928 in this mode. In \nshutdown mode, all  internal circuitry on the AD7908/ AD7918/  \nAD7928 is powered down. The part retains information in the \ncontrol register during shutdown. The AD7908/ AD7918/  \nAD7928 remains in shutdown until the next CS falling edge it \nreceives. On this CS falling edge, the track -and-hold that was in \nhold whil e the part was in shutdown return s to track. Wakeup \ntime from a uto shutdown is 1  μs, and the user should ensure \nthat 1 μs has elapsed before attempting a valid conversion. \nWhen running the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 with a 20 MHz \nclock, one dummy cycle should be sufficient to ensu re the part \nis fully powered up. During this dummy cycle the contents of the control register should remain unchanged; therefore the \nWRITE bit should be 0 on the DIN line. This dummy cycle effectively halves the throughput rate of the part, with every othe r conversion result being valid. In this mode, the power \nconsumption of the part is greatly reduced with the part enter ing \nshutdown at the end of each conversion. When the c ontrol \nregister  is programmed to move into a uto shutdown, it does so \nat the end of the conversion. The user can move the ADC in \nand out of the low power state by controlling the \nCS signal.  \nPowering Up the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928  \nWhen supplies are first applied to  the AD7908 /AD7918/  \nAD7928, the ADC can  power up in any of the operating modes \nof the part. To ensure the part is placed into the required \noperating mode, the user should perform a dummy cycle operation as outlined in Figure 24. \nCS\nSCLK\nDOUT\nDIN1 16 14 1PART IS IN\nFULL SHUTD OWNPART BEGINS TO POWER UP ON\nCS RISING EDGE AS PM1 = PM0 = 1THE PART IS FUL LY POWERED UP\nONCE tPOWER UP  HAS ELAPSED\nCONTROL REGISTER IS LOADED ON THE FIRST 12 CLOCKS.\nPM1 = 1, PM0 = 1TO KEEP THE PART IN NORMAL MODE ,\nLOAD PM1 = PM0 = 1 IN CONT ROL REGISTERCHANNEL IDENTIFIER BITS + CONVERSION RESULT\nDATA IN TO CONTROL REGISTER DATA IN TO CONTROL/SHADOW REGISTER16 14t12\n03089-022 \nFigure 22.

THR OUGHPUT RATE  \nBy operating in a uto shutdown mode on the AD7908/ AD7918/  \nAD7928, the average power consumption of the ADC decreases \nat lower throughput rates. Figure 25 shows how as the \nthroughput rate is reduced, the part remains in its shutdown \nstate longer and the average power consumption over time drops accordingly.  \nFor example , if the AD7928 is operated  in a continuous \nsampling mode with a throughput rate of 100 kSPS and an SCLK of 20 MHz (AV\nDD = 5 V), and the device is placed in a uto \nshutdown mode, that is , if PM1 = 0 and PM0 = 1, then the \npower consumption is calculated as follows:  \nThe maximum power dissipation during normal operation is \n13.5 mW (AV DD = 5 V). If the power -up time from auto \nshutdown is one dummy cycle, that is, 1 μs, and the remaining conver sion time is another cycle, that is , 1 μs, then the AD7928 \ncan be said to dissipate 13.5 mW for 2 μs during each conversion cycle. For the remai nder of the conversion cycle, \n8 μs, the part remains in a uto shutdown mode. The AD7928 can \nbe said to dissipate 2.5 μW for the remaining 8 μs of the \nconversion cycle. If the throughput rate is 100 kSPS, the cyc le \ntime is 10 μs and the average power dissipated during each cycle is  \n(2/10) × (13.5 mW) + (8  / 10) × (2.5 μW) = 2.702 mW  \nFigure 25 shows the maximum power vs. throughput rate when \nusing the a uto shutdown mode with 3 V and 5 V supplies.  \nAVDD = 5V\nAVDD = 3V10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350POWER (mW)\nTHROUGHPUT (kSPS)\n03089-025 \nFigure 25.

The serial clock provides the conversion \nclock and also controls the transfer of information to and from the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 during each conversion.  \nThe \nCS signal initiates the data transfer and conversion process. \nThe falling edge of CS puts the track -and-hold into hold mode, \ntakes the bus out of three -state; the analog input is sampled at \nthis point. The conversion is also initiated at this point and  \nrequire s 16 SCLK cycles to complete. The track -and-hold goes \nback into track on the 14th SCLK falling edge as shown in \nFigure 27, Figure 28, and Figure 29 at Point B, except when the \nwrite is to the SHADOW r egister, in which cas e the track -and-\nhold does  not return to track until the rising edge of CS, that is, \nPoint C in Figure 30. On the 16 th SCLK falling edge, the DOUT \nline goes back into three -state. If the rising edge of CS occurs \nbefore 16 SCLKs have  elapsed, the conversion is  terminated, the \nDOUT line go es back into three -state, and the c ontrol register is \nnot updated; otherwise DOUT returns to three -state on the \n16th  SCLK falling edge as shown in Figure 27, Figure 28, and \nFigure 29. Sixteen serial clock cycles are required to perf orm the \nconversion proc ess and to access data from the AD7908/  \nAD7918/ AD7928. For the AD7908 /AD7918/ AD7928, the \n8/10/12 bits of data a re preceded  by a leading zero and th e \n3-channel address bits ( ADD2 to ADD0 ) identify which \nchannel the result corresponds to. CS going low provides the \nleading zero to be read in by the microcontroller or DSP . The three remaining address bits and data bits are then clocked out by subsequent SCLK falling edges beginning with the first \naddress bit ( ADD2 ). Thus the first falling clock edge on the \nserial clock has a leading zero provided and also clocks out Address Bit ADD2. The final bit in t he data transfer is valid on \nthe 16th falling edge, having been clocked out on the previous (15th) falling edge. \nWriting of information to the c ontrol register  takes place on the \nfirst 12 falling edges of SCLK in a data transfer, assuming the \nMSB, that is , the WRITE bit, has been set to 1. If the c ontrol \nregister is programmed to use the SHADOW r egister, then \nwriting of information to the SHADOW r egister take s place on \nall 16 SCLK falling edges in the next serial transfer , as shown for \nexample on the AD7928 in Figure 30. Two sequence options can  \nbe programmed in the SHADOW r egister. If the user does not \nwant to program a second sequence, then the eight LSBs should be filled with zeros. The SHADOW r egister is updated upon the \nrising edge of \nCS and the track -and-hold begin s to tra ck the \nfirst channel selected in the sequence.  \nAD7908/AD7918/AD7928 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 24 of 28 The AD7908 outputs a leading zero and three channel address \nbits that the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the \n8-bit conversion result and four trailing zeros. The AD7918 \noutputs a leading zero and three channel address bits that the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the 10-bit conversion result and two trailing zeros. The 16-bit word read \nfrom the AD7928 always contains a leading zero and three \nchannel address bits that the conversion result corresponds to, \nfollowed by the 12-bit conversion result. \nMICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING \nThe serial interface on the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 allows the \npart to be directly connected to a range of many different \nmicroprocessors. This section explains how to interface the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 with some of the more common \nmicrocontroller and DSP serial interface protocols. AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 to TMS320C541 \nThe serial interface on the TMS320C541 uses a continuous serial clock and frame synchronization signals to synchronize \nthe data transfer operations with peripheral devices like the \nAD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928. The CS\n input allows easy interfacing \nbetween the TMS320C541 and the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928  \nwithout any glue logic required. The serial port of the \nTMS320C541 is set up to operate in burst mode with internal CLKX0 (Tx serial clock on Serial Port 0) and FSX0 (Tx frame sync from Serial Port 0). The serial port control register (SPC) \nmust have the following setup: FO = 0, FSM = 1, MCM = 1, and \nTXM = 1. The connection diagram is shown in Figure 26. It should be noted that for signal processing applications, it is imperative that the frame synchronization signal from the TMS320C541 provides equidistant sampling. The V\nDRIVE  pin of \nthe AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 takes the same supply voltage as \nthat of the TMS320C541. This allows the ADC to operate at a higher voltage than the serial interface, that is, TMS320C541, if \nnecessary. \nTMS320C5411AD7908/\nAD7918/\nAD79281\nCLKX\nCLKR\nDR\nDTFSX\nFSR\nV\nDDSCLK\nDOUT\nDIN\nCS\n1ADDITIONAL PINS REMOVED FOR CLARITY.VDRIVE\n03089-030 \nFigure 26.

E | Page 26 of 28 AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928 to ADSP- 21xx  \nThe ADSP -21xx family of DSPs are interfaced directly to the \nAD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 without any glue lo gic required. The \nVDRIVE  pin of the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 takes the same \nsupply  voltage as that of the ADSP -21xx. This allows the ADC \nto operate at a higher voltage  than the serial interface, that is, \nADSP -21xx, if necessary.  \nThe SPORT0 control register should be set up as follows:  \nTFSW = RFSW = 1, a lternate framing  \nINVRFS = INVTFS = 1, a ctive low frame signal  \nDTYPE = 00, r ight justify data \nSLEN = 1111, 16- bit data-words  \nISCLK = 1, i nternal serial clock \nTFSR = RFSR = 1, f rame every word \nIRFS = 0  \nITFS = 1  \nThe connection diagram is shown in  Figure 31. The ADSP -21xx \nhas the TFS and RFS of the SPORT tied together, with TFS set \nas an output and RFS set as an input. The DSP opera tes in \nalternate framing mode and the SPORT control register is set \nup as described. The frame synchronization signal generated on \nthe TFS is tied to CS, as with all signal processing applications \nwhere equidistant sampling is necessary. However, in this \nexample the timer interrupt is used to control the sampling rate \nof the ADC, and under certain cond itions equidistant sampling \ncannot be achieved.   \nAD7908/\nAD7918/\nAD79281ADSP-21xx 1\nSCLK\nDR\nRFS\nTFS\nDTSCLK\nDOUT\nCS\nDINVDRIVE\nVDD1ADDITIONAL PINS REMOVED FOR CLARITY.\n03089-031 \nFigure 31. Interfacing to the ADSP -21x x \nThe timer register, for examp le, is loaded with a value that \nprovide s an interrupt at the required sample interval. When an \ninterrupt is received, a value is transmitted with TFS/DT (ADC control word). The TFS is used to control the RFS and thus the reading of data. The frequency  of the serial clock is set in the \nSCLKDIV register. When the instruction to transmit with TFS is given (that is , AX0 = TX0), the state of the SCLK is checked. \nThe DSP waits until the SCLK has gone h igh, low, and high \nbefore transmission can sta rt. If the timer and SCLK values are \nchosen , such that the instruction to transmit occurs on or near \nthe rising edge of SCLK, then the data can  be transmitted or it \ncan wait until the next clock edge.  \n For example, if the ADSP -2189 had a 20 MHz crystal such that \nit had a master clock frequency of 40 MHz, then the master \ncycle time would be 25 ns. If the SCLKDIV register was loaded with the value 3, then an SCLK of 5 MHz is obtained, and eight master clock periods elapse for every one SCLK period. Depending on the thro ughput rate selected, if the timer register \nis loaded with the value, say 803 ( 803 + 1 = 804), 100.5 SCLKs  \noccur between interrupts and subsequently between transmit instructions. This situation result s in nonequidistant sampling \nas the transmit instructio n is occurring on a SCLK edge. If the \nnumber of SCLKs between interrupts is a whole integer figure of N, t hen equidistant sampling is  implemented by the DSP .  \nAD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928 to DSP563xx  \nThe connection diagram in Figure 32 shows how the \nAD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 can be connected to the synchronous  \nserial  interface  (ESSI ) of the DSP563xx family of DSPs from \nMotoro la. Each ESSI  (two on board) is operated in s ynchronous \nmode (SYN bit in CRB = 1) with internally generated word length frame sync for both Tx and Rx (Bit  FSL1 = 0 and \nBit FSL0 = 0 in CRB). Normal operation of the ESSI is selected \nby making MOD = 0 in the CRB. Set th e word length to 16 by \nsetting Bit  WL1 = 1 and Bit WL0 = 0 in CRA. The FSP bit in the \nCRB should be set to 1 so the frame sync is negative. It should \nbe noted that for signal processing applications, it is imperative \nthat the frame synchronization signal from the DSP563xx \nprovides equidistant sampling.  \nIn the example shown in Figure 32, the serial clock is taken \nfrom the ESSI so the SCK0 pin must be set as an output, SCKD = 1. The V\nDRIVE pin of the AD7908 /AD7918 /AD7928 takes the \nsame supply voltage as that of the DSP563xx. This allows the ADC to operate at a higher voltage than the serial interface, that \nis, DSP563xx, if necessary.  \nAD7908/\nAD7918/\nAD79281DSP563xx1\nSCK\nSRD\nSTD\nSC2SCLK\nDOUT\nDIN\nVDRIVE\nVDD1ADDITIONAL PINS REMOVED FOR CLARITY.CS\n03089-032 \nFigure 32.

E | Page 27 of 28 APPLICATION HINTS  \nGrounding and Layout  \nThe AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 have very good immunity to \nnoise on the power supplies , as can be seen by the PSRR vs. \nSuppl y Ripple Frequency plot, Figure 6. However, care should \nstill be taken with regard to grounding and layout.  \nThe printed circuit board that houses the AD7908/ AD7918/  \nAD7928 should be designed so  that the analog and digital \nsections are separated and confined to certain areas of the \nboard. This facilitates the use of ground planes that can be separated easily. A minimum etch technique is generally best for ground planes as it gives the best shielding.  \nAll four AGND pins of the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 should be \nsunk in the AGND plane. If the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD792 8 is in \na system where multiple devices require an AGND to DGND \nconnection, the connection should be made at only one point in the plane. Using a star ground point, the connection  should be \nestablis hed as close as possible to the AD7908 /AD7918/  \nAD7928.  \nAvoid running digital lines under the device , as these  couple \nnoise onto the die. The analog ground plane should be allowed to run under the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 to avoid noise \ncoupling. The power supply lines to the AD7908/ AD7918/  \nAD7928 should use as large a trace as possible to provide low \nimpedance paths and reduce the effects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals, like clocks, should be \nshielded with digital ground to avoid radiating noise to other \nsections of the board, and clock signals should never be run \nnear the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital and analog \nsignals. Traces on opposite sides of the board should run at right  angles to each other. This  reduce s the effects of feedthrough through the board. A microstrip technique is by far \nthe best , but is not always possible with a double sided  board. In \nthis technique, the component side of the board is dedicated to \nground planes while signals are placed on the solder side.  \nGood decoupling is also important. All analog supplies shou ld \nbe decoupled with 10 μF tantalum in parallel with 0.1 μF capacitors to AGND. To achieve the best performance from \nthese decoupling components, they must be placed as close as possible to the device, ideally right up against the device. The 0.1 μF capaci tors should have low e ffective series resistance \n(ESR) and effective series inductance (ESI), such as the \ncommon ceramic types or surface mount types, which provide a low impedance path to ground at high frequencies to handle transient currents due to inte rnal logic switching.  \nEvaluating the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 Performance  \nThe recommended layout for the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 is \noutlined in the AD7908/ AD7918 /AD7928 evaluation board. The \nevaluation board package includes a fully assembled and tested evaluation board, documentation, and software for controlling the board from the P C via the e val-board controller.  \nThe eval-board controller can be used in conjunction with the \nAD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 evaluation board, as well as many \nother Analog Devices evaluation boards ending  in the CB \ndesignator, to demonstrate/evaluate the ac and dc performance of the AD7908/ AD7918/ AD7928 . \nThe software allows the user to perform ac (fast Fourier \ntransform) and dc (histogram of code s) tests on the \nAD7908/  \nAD7918/ AD7928. The software and documentation are on a CD \nshipped with the evaluation board.  \nAD7908/AD7918/AD7928 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
