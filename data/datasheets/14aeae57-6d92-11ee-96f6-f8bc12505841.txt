An internal holding capacitor and matched\napplications resistors have been provided for high precision and\napplications flexibility.\nThe performance of the AD585 makes it ideal for high speed\n10- and 12-bit data acquisition systems, where fast acquisition\ntime, low sample-to-hold offset, and low droop are critical. The\nAD585 can acquire a signal to ±0.01% in 3 µs maximum, and\nthen hold that signal with a maximum sample-to-hold offset of\n3 mV and less than 1 mV/ms droop, using the on-chip hold\ncapacitor. If lower droop is required, it is possible to add alarger external hold capacitor.\nThe high speed analog switch used in the AD585 exhibits\naperture jitter of 0.5 ns, enabling the device to sample full scale\n(20 V peak-to-peak) signals at frequencies up to 78 kHz with12-bit precision.\nThe AD585 can be used with any user-defined feedback net-\nwork to provide any desired gain in the sample mode. On-chip\nprecision thin-film resistors can be used to provide gains of +1,–1, or +2. Output impedance in the hold mode is sufficiently\nlow to maintain an accurate output signal even when driving the\ndynamic load presented by a successive-approximation A/Dconverter. However, the output is protected against damage\nfrom accidental short circuits.\nThe control signal for the HOLD command can be either active\nhigh or active low. The differential HOLD signal is compatiblewith all logic families, if a suitable reference level is prov ided. An\non-chip TTL reference level is provided for TTL compatibility.The AD585 is available in three performance grades. The JP\ngrade is specified for the 0 °C to +70 °C commercial temperature\nrange and packaged in a 20-pin PLCC. The AQ grade is speci-\nfied for the –25 °C to +85 °C industrial temperature range and is\npackaged in a 14-pin cerdip. The SQ and SE grades are speci-fied for the –55 °C to +125 °C military temperature range and\nare packaged in a 14-pin cerdip and 20-pin LCC.\nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1. The fast acquisition time (3 µs) and low aperture jitter\n (0.5 ns) make it the first choice for very high speed dataacquisition systems.\n2. The droop rate is only 1.0 mV/ms so that it may be used in\nslower high accuracy systems without the loss of accuracy.\n3. The low charge transfer of the analog switch keeps sample-to\nhold offset below 3 mV with the on-chip 100 pF hold capaci-tor, eliminating the trade-off between acquisition time and\nS/H offset required with other SHAs.\n4. The AD585 has internal pretrimmed application resistors for\napplications versatility.\n5. The AD585 is complete with an internal hold capacitor for\nease of use. Capacitance can be added externally to reduce\nthe droop rate when long hold times and high accuracy are\nrequired.\n6. The AD585 is recommended for use with 10- and 12-bit\nsuccessive-approximation A/D converters such as AD573,\nAD574A, AD674A, AD7572 and AD7672.\n7. The AD585 is available in versions compliant with MIL-STD-\n883.

A –4–SAMPLED DATA SYSTEMS\nIn sampled data systems there are a number of limiting factors\nin digitizing high frequency signals accurately. Figure 9 showspictorially the sample-and-hold errors that are the limiting fac-\ntors. In the following discussions of error sources the errors will\nbe divided into the following groups: 1. Sample-to-Hold Transi-tion, 2. Hold Mode and 3. Hold-to-Sample Transition.\nFigure 9. Pictorial Showing Various S/H Characteristics\nSAMPLE-TO-HOLD TRANSITION\nThe aperture delay time is the time required for the sample-and-\nhold amplifier to switch from sample to hold. Since this is effec-\ntively a constant then it may be tuned out. If however, theaperture delay time is not accounted for then errors of the mag-\nnitude as shown in Figure 10 will result.\nFigure 10. Aperture Delay Error vs. Frequency\nTo eliminate the aperture delay as an error source the sample-to-hold command may be advanced with respect to the input\nsignal .\nOnce the aperture delay time has been eliminated as an error\nsource then the aperture jitter which is the variation in aperture\ndelay time from sample-to-sample remains. The aperture jitter is\na true error source and must be considered. The aperture jitteris a result of noise within the switching network which modu-\nlates the phase of the hold command and is manifested in the\nvariations in the value of the analog input that has been held.The aperture error which results from this jitter is directly re-\nlated to the dV/dT of the analog input.\nThe error due to aperture jitter is easily calculated as shown be-\nlow. The error calculation takes into account the desired accu-racy corresponding to the resolution of the N-bit A/D converter.    fMAX=2±(N+1)\nπ(Aperture Jitter )\nFor an application with a 10-bit A/D converter with a 10 V full\nscale to a 1/2 LSB error maximum.\n    fMAX=2±( 10+1)\nπ(0.5×10±9)\nfMAX=310.8 kHz.\nFor an application with a 12-bit A/D converter with a 10 V full\nscale to a 1/2 LSB error maximum:\n    fMAX=2±( 12+1)\nπ(0.5×10±9)\nfMAX=77.7 kHz.\nFigure 11 shows the entire range of errors induced by aperture\njitter with respect to the input signal frequency.\nFigure 11. Aperture Jitter Error vs. Frequency\nSample-to-hold offset is caused by the transfer of charge to the\nholding capacitor via the gate capacitance of the switch when\nswitching into hold. Since the gate capacitance couples theswitch control voltage applied to the gate on to the hold capaci-\ntor, the resulting sample-to-hold offset is a function of the logic\nlevel .\nThe logic inputs were designed for application flexibility and,\ntherefore, a wide range of logic thresholds. This was achieved by\nusing a differential input stage for HOLD and \nHOLD . Figure 1\nshows the change in the sample-to-hold offset voltage basedupon an independently programmed reference voltage. Since\nthe input stage is a differential configuration, the offset voltage\nis a function of the control voltage range around the pro-\ngrammed threshold voltage.\nThe sample-to-hold offset can be reduced by adding capacitance\nto the internal 100 pF capacitor and by using \nHOLD  instead of\nHOLD. This may be easily accomplished by adding an externalcapacitor between Pins 7 and 8. The sample-to-hold offset is\nthen governed by the relationship:\n      S/H Offset (V)=Charge pC()\nCHTotal (pF)\nAD585\nREV. A –5–For the AD585 in particular it becomes:\n      S/H Offset (V)=0.3 pC\n100pF+CEXT()\nThe addition of an external hold capacitor also affects the acqui-\nsition time of the AD585. The change in acquisition time with\nrespect to the C EXT is shown graphically in Figure 2.\nHOLD MODE\nIn the hold mode there are two important specifications thatmust be considered; feedthrough and the droop ra te. Feedthrough\nerrors appear as an attenuated version of the input at the output\nwhile in the hold mode. Hold-Mode feedthrough varies with fre-quency, increasing at higher frequencies. Feedthrough is an im-\nportant specification when a sample and hold follows an analog\nmultiplexer that switches among many different channels.\nHold-mode droop rate is the change in output voltage per unit\nof time while in the hold mode. Hold-mode droop originates as\nleakage from the hold capacitor, of which the major leakage\ncurrent contributors are switch leakage current and bias current.The rate of voltage change on the capacitor dV/dT is the ratio of\nthe total leakage current I\nL to the hold capacitance C H.\n    Droop Rate =dVOUT\ndT(Volts/Sec)=IL(pA)\nCH(pF)\nFor the AD585 in particular;\n    Droop Rate =100pA\n100pF+(CEXT)\nAdditionally the leakage current doubles for every 10 °C increase\nin temperature above 25 °C; therefore, the hold-mode droop rate\ncharact eristic will also double in the same fas hion. The hold-mode\ndroop rate can be traded-off with acquisition time to provide thebest combination of droop error and acquisition time. The tradeoff\nis easily accomplished by varying the value of C\nEXT.\nSince a sample and hold is used typically in combination with\nan A/D converter, then the total droop in the output voltage hasto be less than 1/2 LSB during the period of a conversion. The\nmaximum allowable signal change on the input of an A/D\nconverter is:\n      ΔV max =Full -Scale Voltage\n2N+1()\nOnce the maximum ΔV is determined then the conversion time\nof the A/D converter (T CONV) is required to calculate the maxi-\nmum allowable dV/dT.\n    dV\ndtmax=ΔV max\nTCONV\nThe maximum \n    dV max\ndT as shown by the previous equation is\nthe limit not only at 25 °C but at the maximum expected operat-\ning temperature range. Therefore, over the operating temper ature\nrange the following criteria must be met (T OPERATION   –25°C)\n= ΔT.\n      dV25°C\ndT×2ΔT°C()\n10°C≤dV max\ndTHOLD-TO-SAMPLE TRANSITION\nThe Nyquist theorem states that a band-limited signal which is\nsampled at a rate at least twice the maximum signal frequencycan be reconstructed without loss of information. This means\nthat a sampled data system must sample, convert and acquire\nthe next point at a rate at least twice the signal frequency. Thusthe maximum input frequency is equal to\n    fMAX=1\n2TACQ+TCONV+TAP ()\nWhere T ACQ is the acquisition time of the sample-to-hold\namplifier, T AP is the maximum aperture time (small enough to\nbe ignored) and T CONV is the conversion time of the A/D\nconverter.\nDATA ACQUISITION SYSTEMS\nThe fast acquisition time of the AD585 when used with a highspeed A/D converter allows accurate digitization of high fre-\nquency signals and high throughput rates in multichannel data\nacquisition systems. The AD585 can be used with a number ofdifferent A/D converters to achieve high throughput rates. Fig-\nures 12 and 13 show the use of an AD585 with the AD578 and\nAD574A.\nFigure 12. A/D Conversion System, 117.6 kHz Throughput\n58.8 kHz max Signal Input\nFigure 13. 12-Bit A/D Conversion System, 26.3 kHz\nThroughput Rate, 13.1 kHz max Signal Input\nAD585\nREV. A –6–\nPRINTED IN U.S.A. C851c–5–4/89LOGIC INPUT\nThe sample-and-hold logic control was designed for versatile\nlogic interfacing. The HOLD and HOLD  inputs may be used\nwith both low and high level CMOS, TTL and ECL logic sys-\ntems. Logic threshold programmability was achieved by using adifferential amplifier as the input stage for the digital inputs. A\npredictable logic threshold may be programmed by referencing\neither HOLD or \nHOLD  to the appropriate threshold voltage.\nFor example, if the internal 1.4 V reference is applied to HOLD\nan input signal to HOLD between +1.8 V and +V S will place\nthe AD585 in the hold mode. The AD585 will go into thesample mode for this case when the input is between –V\nS and\n+1.0 V. The range of references which may be applied is from\n(–V S +4 V) to (+V S –3 V).\nOPTIONAL CAPACITOR SELECTION\n If an additional capacitor is going to be used in conjunctionwith the internal 100 pF capacitor it must have a low dielectric\nabsorption. Dielectric absorption is just that; it is the charge\nabsorbed into the dielectric that is not immediately added to orremoved from the capacitor when rapidly charged or discharged.\nThe c apacitor with dielectric absorption is modeled in F igure 14.\nFigure 14. Capacitor Model with Dielectric Absorption\nIf the capacitor is charged slowly, C DA will eventually charge to\nthe same value as C. But unfortunately, good dielectrics have\nvery high resistances, so while C DA may be small, R X is large and\nthe time constant R X CDA typically runs into the millisecond\nrange. In fast charge, fast-discharge situations the effect of di-\nelectric absorption resembles “memory”.  In a data acquisition\nsystem where many channels with widely varying data are beingsampled the effect is to have an ever changing offset which ap-\npears as a very nonlinear sample-to-hold offset since the differ-ence between the voltage being measured and the voltage previ-\nously measured determines the fraction by which thedielectric absorption figure is multiplied. It is impossible to\nreadily correct for this error source. The only solution is to use a\ncapacitor with dielectric absorption less than the maximumtolerable error. Capacitor types such as polystyrene, polypropy-\nlene or Teflon are recommended.\nGROUNDING\nMany data-acquisition components have two or more ground\npins which are not connected together within the device. These“grounds” are usually referred to as the Logic Power Return\nAnalog Common (Analog Power Return), and Analog Signal\nGround. These grounds must be tied together at one point,usually at the system power-supply ground. Ideally, a single\nsolid ground would be desirable. However, since current flows\nthrough the ground wires and etch stripes of the circuit cards,and since these paths have resistance and inductance, hundreds\nof millivolts can be generated between the system ground point\nand the ground pin of the AD585. Separate ground returnsshould be provided to minimize the current flow in the path\nfrom sensitive points to the system ground point. In this way\nsupply currents and logic-gate return currents are not summedinto the same return path as analog signals where they would\ncause measurement errors.\nFigure 15.
