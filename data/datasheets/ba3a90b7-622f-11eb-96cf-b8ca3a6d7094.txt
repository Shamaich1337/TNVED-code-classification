(In order to sat isfy the supplying stability, management \noptimization and the best product performance...etc , under the premise of not affecting the \nelectrical characteristics and external dimensions,  Raystar have the right to modify the \nversion.) \n(10) Raystar has the right to upgrade or modify the  product function. \n \n11.1. Handling Precautions \n(1) Since the display panel is being made of glass,  do not apply mechanical impacts such as \ndropping from a high position. \n(2) If the display panel is broken by some accident  and the internal organic substance leaks out, \nbe careful not to inhale nor lick the organic subst ance. \n(3) If pressure is applied to the display surface o r its neighborhood of the OLED display module, \nthe cell structure may be damaged. So, be careful n ot to apply pressure to these sections. \n(4) The polarizer covering the surface of the OLED display module is soft and easily scratched.  \n(5) When the surface of the polarizer of the OLED d isplay module has soil, clean the surface. It \ntakes advantage by using following adhesion tape. \n* Scotch Mending Tape No. 810 or an equivalent \nNever try to breathe upon the soiled surface nor wi pe the surface using cloth containing \nsolvent such as ethyl alcohol, since the surface of  the polarizer will become cloudy. \nAlso, pay attention that the following liquid and s olvent may spoil the polarizer: \n* Water \n* Ketone \n* Aromatic Solvents \n(6) Protection film is being applied to the surface  of the display panel and removes the \nprotection film before assembling it. At this time,  if the OLED display module has been \nstored for a long period of time, residue adhesive material of the protection film may remain \non the surface of the display panel after removed o f the film. In such case, remove the \nresidue material by the method introduced in the ab ove Section 5. \n(7) Do not touch the following sections whenever po ssible while handling the OLED display \nmodules. \n* Pins and electrodes \n* Pattern layouts such as the TCP & FPC \n(8) Hold OLED display module very carefully when pl acing OLED display module into the \n \n    \n \n \nPage 26 , Total 29 Pages System housing. Do not apply excessive stress or pr essure to OLED display module. And, \ndo not over bend the film with electrode pattern la youts. These stresses will influence the \ndisplay performance. Also, secure sufficient rigidi ty for the outer cases. \n \n(9) Do not apply stress to the LSI chips and the su rrounding molded sections.  \n(10) Pay sufficient attention to the working enviro nments when handing OLED display modules \nto prevent occurrence of element breakage accidents  by static electricity. \n* Be sure to make human body grounding when handlin g OLED display modules. \n* Be sure to ground tools to use or assembly such a s soldering irons. \n* To suppress generation of static electricity, avo id carrying out assembly work under dry \nenvironments. \n* Protective film is being applied to the surface o f the display panel of the OLED display \nmodule. Be careful since static electricity may be generated when exfoliating the protective \nfilm. \n \n11.2. Storage Precautions \n(1) When storing OLED display modules, put them in static electricity preventive bags to avoid \nbe directly exposed to sun or lights of fluorescent  lamps. And, also, place in the temperature \n25±5°C and Humidity below 65% RH.(We recommend you to store these modules in the \npackaged state when they were shipped from Winstar.  At that time, be careful not to let \nwater drops adhere to the packages or bags.) \n \n(2) When the OLED display module is being dewed or when it is placed under high temperature \nor high humidity environments, the electrodes may b e corroded if electric current is applied. \nPlease store it in clean environment. \n \n11.3. Designing Precautions \n(1) The absolute maximum ratings are the ratings wh ich cannot be exceeded for OLED display \nmodule, and if these values are exceeded, OLED disp lay module may be damaged. \n(2) To prevent occurrence of malfunctioning by nois e, pay attention to satisfy the VIL and VIH \nspecification and to make the signal line cable as short as possible. \n(3) We recommend you to install excess current prev entive unit (fuses, etc.) to the power circuit \n(VDD / VCC). (Recommend value: 0.5A) \n(4) Pay sufficient attention to avoid occurrence of  mutual noise interference with the nearby \ndevices. \n(5) As for EMI, take necessary measures on the equi pment side basically. \n(6) If the power supplied to the OLED display modul e is forcibly shut down by such errors as \ntaking out the main battery while the OLED display panel is in operation, we cannot \nguarantee the quality of this OLED display module. \n\n \n    \n \n \nPage 27 , Total 29 Pages * Connection (contact) to any other potential than the above may lead to rupture of the IC. \n(7) If this OLED driver is exposed to light, malfun ctioning may occur and semiconductor \nelements may change their characteristics. \n(8) The internal status may be changed, if excessiv e external noise enters into the module.   \nTherefore, it is necessary to take appropriate meas ures to suppress noise generation or to \nprotect module from influences of noise on the syst em design. \n(9) We recommend you to make periodical refreshment  of the operation statuses (re-setting of \nthe commands and re-transference of the display dat a) to cope with catastrophic noise. \n(10) It\'s pretty common to use "Screen Saver" to ex tend the lifetime and Don\'t use the same \nimage for long time in real application. When an OL ED display module is operated for a long \nof time with fixed pattern, an afterimage or slight  contrast deviation may occur. \n(11) The limitation of FPC and Film bending. \n \n \n(12) The module should be fixed balanced into the h ousing, or the module may be twisted. \n \n(13) Please heat up a little the tape sticking on t he components when removing it; otherwise the \ncomponents might be damaged. \n \n \n11.4. Precautions when disposing of the OLED displa y modules \n(1) Request the qualified companies to handle indus trial wastes when disposing of the OLED \ndisplay modules. Or, when burning them, be sure to observe the environmental and hygienic \nlaws and regulations. \n0.1 (0.1 Max.) \n \n    \n \n \nPage 28 , Total 29 Pages Page: 1 \nModule Sample Estimate Feedback Sheet  \nModule Number ：                                              \n \n1、Panel Specification ： \n  1.
