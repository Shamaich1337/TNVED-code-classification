These devices are \nconstructed using over/under leadframe optical coupling and double molded insulation resulting in a withstand test voltage of 5300 V\nRMS.\nThe LED parameters and the linear CTR characteristics make these devices well suited for AC voltage detection. \nThe ILD620GB and ILQ6 20GB with its low I\nF guaranteed \nCTR CEsat minimizes power dissipation of the A C voltage \ndetection network that is placed in series with the LEDs. Eliminating the phototransistor base connection provides added electrical noise immunity from the transients found in many industrial control environments.FEATURES\n• Identical channel to channel footprint• ILD620 crosses to TLP620-2• ILQ620 crosses to TLP620-4• High collector emitter voltage, BV\nCEO = 70 V\n• Dual and quad packages feature: \uf020\n- Reduced board space \uf020\n- Lower pin and parts count \uf020\n- Better channel to channel CTR match \uf020\n- Improved common mode rejection\n• Isolation test voltage 5300 V RMS\n• Material categorization: For definitions of compliance \nplease see www.vishay.com/doc?99912  \nAGENCY APPROVALS\n• UL1577, file no.
