These devices have logic \ninput and output buffers that are separated by using a silicon \ndioxide (SiO 2) barrier. These devi ces block high voltages and \nprevent noise currents from entering the control side ground, \navoiding circuit interference and damaging sensitive components.  \nThe π220N 61/π221N 61 devices  are based on iDivider®  \ntechnology with functional, performance, size, and power \nconsumption advantages as compared to optocouplers.  \nThe π220N 61 provides two bidirectional channels, supporting a \ncomplete isolated I2C interface. The π221N 61 provides one \nbidirectional channel and one unidirectional channel fo r applica - tions where a bidirectional clock is not required. The π22 1N61 is \nused in applications that have a single master while the π22 0N61 \nis suitable for multi -master applications.   \nThese devices feature independent 3.0V to 5.5V supplies on each \nside of the isolator. These devices operate from DC to 2MHz at \nambient temperatures of -40° C to +125° C.   \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAMS  \nGND 2\nGND 23\n4\n5\n61\n2\n7\n814\n13\n12\n1116\n15\n10\n9SDA1\nSCL1VDD 2\nNCGND 1\nVDD 1\nGND 1NC\nNC NC\nSDA2\nSCL2\nGND 1  \n π220N61\nNC\n \nGND 2\nGND 23\n4\n5\n61\n2\n7\n814\n13\n12\n1116\n15\n10\n9SDA1\nSCL1VDD 2\nNCGND 1\nNC\nVDD 1\nGND 1NC\nNC NC\nSDA2\nSCL2\nGND 1\nπ221N61\n \nFigure1.  π220N 61/π221N 61 functional  Block Diagram  \nVDD1\nI2C BUSNC1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 910111213141516\nNC\nSDA1\nSCL1\nGND 1\nGND 1GND 1\nC1\n0.1uF\nR1R2GND 2\nNC\nVDD2\nNC\nSDA2\nSCL2\nNC\nGND 2C2\n0.1uF\nR3R4\nπ220N61\n \nFigure2.  π220N 61 Typical Application Circuit\nRev. 1.1   \nInformation furnished by 2Pai semi is believed to be accurate and reliable.

The I2C bus is used for communication \nbetween multiple masters or a single master and slaves. The \nmaster device controls the serial clock line (SCL) and data is \nbidirectional transferred on the serial data line (SDA) between \nmaster and slaves. The I2C bus can theoretically add up  to 112 \ncommunication nodes, however, the number of nodes will \nincrease the load capacitance on the bus, thereby limiting the \ncommunication distances and communication speeds. In \napplications, tradeoffs are often made between communication \nspeeds, bus leng th, and number of nodes based on actual \nconditions.  \nThe I2C bus supports data transmission in four speeds: standard \nmode (up to 100Kbps), fast mode (up to 400Kbps), fast mode \nplus (up to 1Mbps), and high -speed mode (up to 3.4Mbps). The \nπ220N 61/π221N 61 devi ces support all the above four \ncommunication modes.  \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe π220N 61/π221N 61 devices are low -power bidirectional \nisolators compatible with the I2C interface and are based on \niDivider®  technology from 2PaiSemi. These devices have logic \ninput and output buffers that are separated by using a silicon \ndioxide (SiO 2) barrier.  These devices block high voltages and \nprevent noise currents from entering the control side ground, \navoiding circuit interference and damaging sensitive components.  \nEach ch annel output of the π220N 61/π221N 61 devices is made \nopen -drain to comply with the open -drain technology of I2C. \nSerial data line (SDA)and serial clock line (SCL) need to add \npull-up resistors to ensure normal operation of the system. It is \nrecommended that  side 1 of the I2C isolator be connected to the \nprocessor and sides 2 to the bus when there are multiple nodes on \nthe I2C bus as side 2 support up to 400 pF capacitance load.  \nThe π220N 61/π221N 61 devices feature two bidirectional \nchannels that have open -drain outputs , As shown in Figure 20. As \na logic low on one side causes the corresponding pin on the other \nside to be pulled low , to avoid data -latching within the device, \nThe output logic low (VOL1)voltages of SDA1 and SCL1 are at \nleast 60mV higher t han the input threshold high  (VIHT1) of SDA1 \nand SCL1, As shown in Figure 21. \nBecause the Side 2 logic levels/thresholds are standard I2C values,  \nmultiple π220N 61/π221N 61 devices connected to a bus by their \nSide 2 pins can communicate with each other and w ith other I2C \ncompatible devices. However, because the Side 1 pin has a \nmodified output level/ input threshold, this side of the \nπ220N 61/π221N 61 can communicate only with devices that \nconform to the I2C standard.  \nThe output low voltages of π220N 61/π221N 61 devices are \nguaranteed for sink currents of up to 35mA for side 2, and 3.5mA \nfor side 1.  To enhance system reliability, it is recommended to connect the \nnode with larger load capacitance and longer wires on side 2 for \npoint -to-point communication.  \n \n83\n914VDD1\nSDA1/SCL1\nGND 1VDD2\nSDA2/SCL2\nGND 2VDD2VDD1\nR1\nC1Input side 1output side 1Input side 2\noutput side 25/6 11/12\nFigure 20. π220N 61 system operation diagram  \nV\nSDA1/SCL1vILT1vIHT1vOL1\nΔVOIT 1 = VOL1   VIHT 1\n \nFigure 21. π220N 61/ π221N 61 side 1 voltage Diagram  \nTYPICAL APPLICATION DIAGRAM  \nFigure  22 shows a typical application circuit including the pull -up \nresistors required for both Side 1 and Side 2. Bypass capacitors \nwith values from 0.1μF to 10μF are required between V DD1 and \nGND1 and between V DD2 and GND2. To enhance the robustness \nof a design, the user may connect a resistor (50 -200 Ω) in series \nbetwee n R2 and C1 and between R3 and C2 if the system is \nexcessively noisy.  \nThe π220N 61/π221N 61 are designed for operation at speeds up to \n2 MHZ. Due to the limited current available on side 1 and side2, \noperation at 2MHZ limits the capacitance that can be drive n at \nthe minimum pull -up value to 40pF and 400pF.  \nMost applications operate at 100 kbps in standard mode or 400 \nkbps in fast mode. At these lower operating speeds, the limitation \non the load capacitance can be significantly relaxed. If larger \nvalues for t he pull up resistor are used, the maximum supported \ncapacitance must be scaled down proportionately so that the rise \ntime does not increase beyond the values required by the standard.  \nVDD1\nI2C BUSNC1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 910111213141516\nNC\nSDA1\nSCL1\nGND 1\nGND 1GND 1\nC1\n0.1uF\nR1R2GND 2\nNC\nVDD2\nNC\nSDA2\nSCL2\nNC\nGND 2C2\n0.1uF\nR3R4\nπ220N61\n \nFigure 22.
