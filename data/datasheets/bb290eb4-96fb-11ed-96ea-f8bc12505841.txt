Like TOPSwitch, the \nhigh-voltage power MOSFET, PWM control, fault protection and other control circuitry are all integrated onto a single CMOS chip, but with two added terminals. The first one is a \nMULTI-FUNCTION  (M) pin, which implements programmable \nline OV/UV shutdown and line feed-forward/DC\nMAX reduction \nwith line voltage.  The same pin can be used instead to \nexternally set an accurate current limit.  In either case, this pin \ncan also be used for remote ON/OFF or to synchronize the \noscillator to an external, lower frequency signal.  The second added terminal is the FREQUENCY (F) pin and is available only in the Y package.  This pin provides the half frequency option \nwhen connected to CONTROL (C) instead of SOURCE (S).  \nThe features on the new pins can be disabled by shorting them to the SOURCE, which allows the device to operate in a three terminal TOPSwitch  mode, but with the following new \ntransparent features: soft-start, cycle skipping, 132  kHz \nswitching frequency, frequency jittering, wider DC\nMAX, hysteretic thermal shutdown and larger creepage.  In addition, \nall critical parameters such as frequency, current limit, PWM \ngain, etc. have tighter temperature and absolute tolerances \ncompared to the TOPSwitch-II family. Higher current limit accuracy and larger DC\nMAX, when combined with other \nfeatures allow for a 10% to 15% higher power capability on the TOPSwitch-FX devices compared to equivalent TOPSwitch-II \ndevices for the same input/output conditions.TOP232P\nTOP232G\nTOP232Y\nTOP233P\nTOP233G\nTOP233Y\nTOP234P\nTOP234G\nTOP234Y230 VAC ±15%\nAdapter185-265 VAC\n 9 W 15 W  6.5 W  10 W\n 10 W  25 W  7 W  15 W\n 13 W  25 W  9 W  15 W\n 20 W  50 W  15 W  30 W\n 16 W  30 W  11 W  20 W\n 30 W  75 W  20 W  45 WTOP232-234 \nTOPSwitch-FX Family\nwww.power.com     June 2015Design Flexible, EcoSmart, Integrated\nOff-Line Switcher\nThis Product is Covered by Patents and/or Pending Patent Applications.This product is not recommended for new designs.\nRev.

During normal operation the duty cycle of the \npower MOSFET decreases linearly with increasing CONTROL pin current as shown in Figure 4. \nIn addition to the three terminal TOPSwitch features, such as \nthe high-voltage start-up, the cycle-by-cycle current limiting, loop compensation circuitry, auto-restart, thermal shutdown, etc., the TOPSwitch-FX incorporates many additional functions that reduce system cost, increase power supply performance \nand design flexibility.  A patented high-voltage CMOS \ntechnology allows both the high-voltage power MOSFET and all the low voltage control circuitry to be cost effectively integrated onto a single monolithic chip. \nTwo terminals, FREQUENCY (available only in Y package) and \nMULTI-FUNCTION, have been added to implement some of the new functions.  These terminals can be connected to the SOURCE pin to operate the TOPSwitch-FX in a TOPSwitch-\nlike three terminal mode.  However, even in this three terminal \nmode, the TOPSwitch-FX offers many new transparent features that do not require any external components: \n1. A fully integrated 10 ms soft-start  reduces peak currents and voltages during start-up and practically eliminates output overshoot in most applications. \n2. DCMAX of 78% allows smaller input storage capacitor, lower  \ninput voltage requirement and/or higher power capability. \n3. Cycle skipping at minimum pulse width achieves regulation and very low power consumption at no load. \n4. Higher switching frequency of 132 kHz reduces the transformer size with no noticeable impact on EMI or on high line efficiency. \n5. Frequency jittering reduces EMI. \n6. Hysteretic over-temperature shutdown ensures automatic recovery from thermal fault. Large hysteresis prevents circuit board overheating. \n7. Packages with omitted pins and lead forming provide large  \nDRAIN creepage distance. \n8. Tighter absolute tolerances and smaller temperature vari- ations on switching frequency, current limit and PWM gain. \nThe MULTI-FUNCTION pin is usually used for line sensing by connecting a resistor from this pin to the rectified DC high-voltage bus to implement line over-voltage (OV)/under-voltage (UV) and line feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction.  In this mode, \nthe value of the resistor determines the OV/UV thresholds and the DC\nMAX is reduced linearly starting from a line voltage above \nthe under-voltage threshold. In high efficiency applications, this pin can be used in the external current limit mode instead, to \nreduce the current limit externally (to a value close to the \noperating peak current), by connecting the pin to SOURCE through a resistor.  The same pin can also be used as a remote ON/OFF and a synchronization input in both modes. The FREQUENCY pin in the TO-220 package sets the switching frequency to the default value of 132 kHz when connected to SOURCE pin. A half frequency option can be chosen by connecting this pin to CONTROL pin instead. \nLeaving this pin open is not recommended.\nCONTROL (C) Pin Operation\nThe CONTROL pin is a low impedance node that is capable of receiving a combined supply and feedback current. During normal operation, a shunt regulator is used to separate the \nfeedback signal from the supply current. CONTROL pin \nvoltage V\nC is the supply voltage for the control circuitry \nincluding the MOSFET gate driver. An external bypass capacitor closely connected between the CONTROL and \nSOURCE pins is required to supply the instantaneous gate \ndrive current.  The total amount of capacitance connected to this pin also sets the auto-restart timing as well as control loop compensation. \nWhen rectified DC high-voltage is applied to the DRAIN pin \nduring start-up, the MOSFET is initially off, and the CONTROL pin capacitor is charged through a switched high-voltage current source connected internally between the DRAIN and \nCONTROL pins. When the CONTROL pin voltage V\nC reaches \napproximately 5.8 V, the control circuitry is activated and the \nsoft-start begins.  The soft-start circuit gradually increases the \nduty cycle of the MOSFET from zero to the maximum value \nover approximately 10 ms. If no external feedback/supply current is fed into the CONTROL pin by the end of the soft-start, the high-voltage current source is turned off and the \nCONTROL pin will start discharging in response to the supply \ncurrent drawn by the control circuitry.  If the power supply is designed properly, and no fault condition such as open loop or shorted output exists, the feedback loop will close, providing external CONTROL pin current, before the CONTROL pin \nvoltage has had a chance to discharge to the lower threshold \nvoltage of approximately 4.8 V (internal supply under-voltage lockout threshold). When the externally fed current charges the  CONTROL pin to the shunt regulator voltage of 5.8 V, current \nRev.

This \ncurrent flowing through RE controls the duty cycle of the power \nMOSFET to provide closed loop regulation.  The shunt \nregulator has a finite low output impedance ZC that sets the \ngain of the error amplifier when used in a primary feedback configuration.  The dynamic impedance Z\nC of the CONTROL \npin together with the external CONTROL pin capacitance sets the dominant pole for the control loop.\nWhen a fault condition such as an open loop or shorted output \nprevents the flow of an external current into the CONTROL pin, the capacitor on the CONTROL pin discharges towards 4.8 V. \nAt 4.8 V auto-restart is activated which turns the output MOSFET \noff and puts the control circuitry in a low current standby mode. The high-voltage current source turns on and charges the external capacitance again.  A hysteretic internal supply under-voltage comparator keeps V\nC within a window of \ntypically 4.8 to 5.8 V by turning the high-voltage current source on and off as shown in Figure 5.  The auto-restart circuit has a \ndivide-by-8 counter which prevents the output MOSFET from \nturning on again until eight discharge/charge cycles have elapsed.  This is accomplished by enabling the output MOSFET only when the divide-by-8 counter reaches full count (S7). The \ncounter effectively limits TOPSwitch-FX power dissipation by \nreducing the auto-restart duty cycle to typically 4%.  Auto-restart mode continues until output voltage regulation is again achieved through closure of the feedback loop.\nOscillator and Switching Frequency\nThe internal oscillator linearly charges and discharges an \ninternal capacitance between two voltage levels to create a sawtooth waveform for the pulse width modulator.  The oscillator sets the pulse width modulator/current limit latch at the beginning of each cycle. \nThe nominal switching frequency of 132 kHz was chosen to \nminimize transformer size while keeping the fundamental EMI \nfrequency below 150 kHz.  The FREQUENCY pin (available only in TO-220 package), when shorted to the CONTROL pin, lowers the switching frequency to 66 kHz (half frequency) \nwhich may be preferable in some cases such as noise \nsensitive video applications or a high efficiency standby mode.   Otherwise, the FREQUENCY pin should be connected to the SOURCE pin for the default 132 kHz.  Trimming of the current reference improves oscillator frequency accuracy.\nTo further reduce the EMI level, the switching frequency is \njittered (frequency modulated) by approximately ±4 kHz at  250 Hz (typical) rate as shown in Figure 6.  Figure 28 shows \nthe typical improvement of EMI measurements with frequency \njitter.\nPulse Width Modulator and Maximum Duty Cycle\nThe pulse width modulator implements voltage mode control by driving the output MOSFET with a duty cycle inversely \nproportional to the current into the CONTROL pin\n that is in \nexcess of the internal supply current of the chip (see Figure 4).  \nThe excess current is the feedback error signal that appears \nacross RE (see Figure 2).  This signal is filtered by an RC \nnetwork with a typical corner frequency of 7 kHz to reduce the \neffect of switching noise in the chip supply current generated  \n \nFigure 5.  Typical Waveforms for (1) Power Up (2) Normal Operation (3) Auto-restart (4) Power Down .  \nRev. C 06/156\nTOP232-234\nwww.power.com Figure 6.  Switching Frequency Jitter.  by the MOSFET gate driver.  The filtered error signal is \ncompared with the internal oscillator sawtooth waveform to generate the duty cycle waveform.  As the control current \nincreases, the duty cycle decreases.  A clock signal from the \noscillator sets a latch which turns on the output MOSFET.  The pulse width modulator resets the latch, turning off the output MOSFET.  Note that a minimum current must be driven into \nthe CONTROL pin before the duty cycle begins to change. \nThe maximum duty cycle, DC\nMAX, is set at a default maximum \nvalue of 78% (typical).  However, by connecting the MULTI-\nFUNCTION pin to the rectified DC high-voltage bus through a \nresistor with appropriate value, the maximum duty cycle can \nbe made to decrease from 78% to 38% (typical) as shown in  Figure 8 when input line voltage increases (see line feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction).\nMinimum Duty Cycle and Cycle SkippingTo maintain power supply output regulation, the pulse width \nmodulator reduces duty cycle as the load at the power supply \noutput decreases.  This reduction in duty cycle is proportional to the current flowing into the CONTROL pin.  As the CONTROL pin current increases, the duty cycle reduces linearly towards \na minimum value specified as minimum duty cycle, DC\nMIN.  \nAfter reaching DCMIN, if CONTROL pin current is increased \nfurther by approximately 0.4 mA, the pulse width modulator \nwill force the duty cycle from DCMIN to zero in a discrete step \n(refer to Figure 4).  This feature allows a power supply to operate in a cycle skipping mode when the load at its output \nconsumes less power than the power that TOPSwitch-FX \ndelivers at minimum duty cycle, DC\nMIN.  No additional control is \nneeded for the transition between normal operation and cycle skipping.  As the load increases or decreases, the power \nsupply automatically switches between normal operation and \ncycle skipping mode as necessary.\nCycle skipping may be avoided, if so desired, by connecting a \nminimum load at the power supply output such that the duty \ncycle remains at a level higher than DC\nMIN at all times.\nError AmplifierThe shunt regulator can also perform the function of an error \namplifier in primary feedback applications.  The shunt regulator \nvoltage is accurately derived from a temperature-compensated bandgap reference.  The gain of the error amplifier is set by the CONTROL pin dynamic impedance. The CONTROL pin \nclamps external circuit signals to the V\nC voltage level. The \nCONTROL pin current in excess of the supply current is \nseparated by the shunt regulator and flows through RE as a \nvoltage error signal. \nOn-Chip Current Limit with External Programmability\nThe cycle-by-cycle peak drain current limit circuit uses the \noutput MOSFET ON-resistance as a sense resistor.  A current limit comparator compares the output MOSFET on-state drain to source voltage, V\nDS(ON) with a threshold voltage.  High drain \ncurrent causes VDS(ON) to exceed the threshold voltage and \nturns the output MOSFET off until the start of the next clock cycle. The default current limit of TOPSwitch-FX is preset internally.  However, with a resistor connected between MULTI-FUNCTION pin and SOURCE pin, current limit can be programmed externally to a lower level between 40% and 100% of the default current limit.  Please refer to the graphs in the typical performance characteristics section for the \nselection of the resistor value.  By setting current limit low, a  \nTOPSwitch-FX that is bigger than necessary for the power required can be used to take advantage of the lower R\nDS(ON) for \nhigher efficiency. With a second resistor connected between the MULTI-FUNCTION pin and the rectified DC high-voltage \nbus providing a small amount of feed-forward current, a true \npower limiting operation against line variation can be implemented. When using an RCD clamp, this feed-forward technique reduces maximum clamp voltage at high line \nallowing for higher reflected voltage designs.  The current limit \ncomparator threshold voltage is temperature compensated to minimize the variation of the current limit due to temperature related changes in  R\nDS(ON) of the output MOSFET.\nThe leading edge blanking circuit inhibits the current limit \ncomparator for a short time after the output MOSFET is turned \non. The leading edge blanking time has been set so that, if a power supply is designed properly, current spikes caused by primary-side capacitances and secondary-side rectifier \nreverse recovery time will not cause premature termination of \nthe switching pulse.\nThe current limit can be lower for a short period after the \nleading edge blanking time as shown in Figure 33. This is due \nto dynamic characteristics of the MOSFET.  To avoid triggering \nthe current limit in normal operation, the drain current waveform should stay within the envelope shown.\nLine Undervoltage Detection (UV)\nAt power up, UV keeps TOPSwitch-FX off until the input line \nvoltage reaches the undervoltage threshold.  At power down, UV prevents auto-restart attempts after the output goes out of regulation.  This eliminates power down glitches caused by the slow discharge of input storage capacitor present in \napplications such as standby supplies.  A single resistor \nconnected from the MULTI-FUNCTION pin to the rectified DC high-voltage bus sets UV threshold during power up. Once the power supply is successfully turned on, UV is disabled to \nPI-2550-092499\n128 kHz\n4 ms\nTimeSwitching\nFrequency\nVDRAIN  136 kHz\nRev. C 06/157\nTOP232-234\nwww.power.com Figure 7.  Synchronization Timing Diagram.  allow extended input voltage operating range.  Input voltage is \nnot checked again until the power supply loses regulation and attempts another turn-on.  This is accomplished by enabling \nthe UV comparator only when the divide-by-8 counter used in \nauto-restart reaches full count (S7) which is also the state that the counter is reset to at power up (see Figure 5). The UV feature can be disabled independent of OV feature as shown \nin Figure 16.\nLine Overvoltage Shutdown (OV)\nThe same resistor used for UV also sets an overvoltage threshold which, once exceeded, will force TOPSwitch-FX output into off-state.  The ratio of OV and UV thresholds is \npreset at 4.5 as can be seen in Figure 8. This feature turns off \nthe TOPSwitch-FX power MOSFET when the rectified DC high-voltage exceeds the OV threshold.  When the MOSFET is off, the rectified DC high-voltage surge capability is increased \nto the voltage rating of the MOSFET (700 V), due to the \nabsence of the reflected voltage and leakage spikes on the drain. Small amount of hysteresis is provided on the OV threshold to prevent noise triggering.  The OV feature can be disabled independent of UV feature as shown in Figure 15.\nLine Feed-Forward with DC\nMAX Reduction\nThe same resistor used for UV and OV also implements line \nvoltage feed-forward which minimizes output line ripple and \nreduces power supply output sensitivity to line transients.  This \nfeed-forward operation is illustrated in Figure 4 by the different values of I\nM.  Note that for the same CONTROL pin current, \nhigher line voltage results in smaller operating duty cycle.  As an added safety measure, the maximum duty cycle DC\nMAX is \nalso reduced from 78% (typical) at a voltage slightly higher than the UV threshold to 38% (typical) at the OV threshold (see \nFigures 4, 8).  DC\nMAX of 38% at the OV threshold was chosen \nto ensure that the power capability of the TOPSwitch-FX is not \nrestricted by this feature under normal operation.Remote ON/OFF and SynchronizationTOPSwitch-FX can be turned on or off by controlling the current into or out from the MULTI-FUNCTION pin (see Figure \n8).  This allows easy implementation of remote ON/OFF control \nof TOPSwitch-FX in several different ways.  A transistor or an optocoupler output connected between the MULTI-FUNCTION pin and the SOURCE pin implements this function with \n“active-on” (Figure 19) while a transistor or an optocoupler \noutput connected between the MULTI-FUNCTION pin and the CONTROL pin implements the function with “active-off” (Figure 20). \nWhen a signal is received at the MULTI-FUNCTION pin to \ndisable the output through any of the MULTI-FUNCTION pin functions such as OV, UV and remote ON/OFF, TOPSwitch-FX  \nalways completes its current switching cycle as illustrated in \nFigure 7 before the output is forced off. The internal oscillator \nis stopped slightly before the end of the current cycle and stays there as long as the disable signal exists.  When the signal at the MULTI-FUNCTION pin changes state from disable to enable, the internal oscillator starts the next switching cycle. \nThis approach allows the use of this pin to synchronize \nTOPSwitch-FX  to any external signal with a frequency lower \nthan its internal switching frequency.\nAs seen above, the remote ON/OFF feature allows the \nTOPSwitch-FX to be turned on and off instantly, on a cycle-by-cycle basis, with very little delay.  However, remote ON/OFF can also be used as a standby or power switch to turn off the TOPSwitch-FX and keep it in a very low power consumption \nstate for indefinitely long periods.  If the TOPSwitch-FX is held \nin remote off state for long enough time to allow the CONTROL pin to dishcharge to the internal supply undervoltage threshold of 4.8 V (approximately 32 ms for a 47 µF CONTROL pin \ncapacitance), the CONTROL pin goes into the hysteretic mode \nof regulation. In this mode, the CONTROL pin goes through \nTime\nRev. C 06/158\nTOP232-234\nwww.power.com alternate charge and discharge cycles between 4.8 V and \n5.8 V (see CONTROL pin operation section above) and runs entirely off the high-voltage DC input, but with very low power \nconsumption (160 mW typical at 230 VAC with M pin open).  \nWhen the TOPSwitch-FX is remotely turned on after entering this mode, it will initiate a normal start-up sequence with soft-start the next time the CONTROL pin reaches 5.8 V. In the \nworst case, the delay from remote on to start-up can be equal \nto the full discharge/charge cycle time of the CONTROL pin, which is approximately 125 ms for a 47 µF CONTROL pin capacitor. This reduced consumption remote off mode can eliminate expensive and unreliable in-line mechanical switches. \nIt also allows for microprocessor controlled turn-on and \nturn-off sequences that may be required in certain applications such as inkjet and laser printers. See Figure 27 under application examples for more information. \nSoft-Start\nAn on-chip soft-start function is activated at start-up with a duration of 10 ms (typical).  Maximum duty cycle starts from zero and linearly increases to the default maximum of 78% at the end of the 10 ms duration.  In addition to start-up, soft-\nstart is also activated at each restart attempt during auto-\nrestart and when restarting after being in hysteretic regulation of CONTROL pin voltage (V\nC), due to remote off or thermal \nshutdown conditions. This effectively minimizes current and voltage stresses on the output MOSFET, the clamp circuit and \nthe output rectifier, during start-up.  This feature also helps \nminimize output overshoot and prevents saturation of the transformer during start-up.\nShutdown/Auto-Restart\nTo minimize TOPSwitch-FX power dissipation under fault \nconditions, the shutdown/auto-restart circuit turns the power supply on and off at an auto-restart duty cycle of typically 4% if an out of regulation condition persists.  Loss of regulation interrupts the external current into the CONTROL pin. V\nC \nregulation changes from shunt mode to the hysteretic auto-restart mode described above.  When the fault condition is \nremoved, the power supply output becomes regulated, VC \nregulation returns to shunt mode, and normal operation of the \npower supply resumes.\nHysteretic Over-Temperature Protection\nTemperature protection is provided by a precision analog circuit that turns the output MOSFET off when the junction temperature exceeds the thermal shutdown temperature  \n(135 ˚C typical).  When the junction temperature cools to below the hysteretic temperature, normal operation resumes. A large hysteresis of 70 ˚C (typical) is provided to prevent overheating of the PC board due to a repeating fault condition. V\nC is \nregulated in hysteretic mode and a 4.8 V to 5.8 V (typical) sawtooth waveform is present on the CONTROL pin when the \npower supply is turned off.\nBandgap Reference\nAll critical TOPSwitch-FX internal voltages are derived from a temperature-compensated bandgap reference.  This reference \nis also used to generate a temperature-compensated current \nreference which is trimmed to accurately set the switching frequency, MOSFET gate drive current, current limit, and the line OV/UV thresholds.  TOPSwitch-FX has improved circuitry \nto maintain all of the above critical parameters within very tight \nabsolute and temperature tolerances. \nHigh-Voltage Bias Current Source\nThis current source biases TOPSwitch-FX from the DRAIN pin and charges the CONTROL pin external capacitance during \nstart-up or hysteretic operation. Hysteretic operation occurs \nduring auto-restart, remote off and over-temperature shutdown.  In this mode of operation, the current source is switched on and off with an effective duty cycle of approximately 35%.  This duty cycle is determined by the ratio of CONTROL pin \ncharge (I\nC) and discharge currents (ICD1 and ICD2).  This current \nsource is turned off during normal operation when the output \nMOSFET is switching.\nRev.

Shorting the FREQUENCY pin to SOURCE pin \nselects the nominal switching frequency of 132 kHz (Figure 10) \nwhich is suited for most applications.  For other cases that may benefit from lower switching frequency such as noise sensitive video applications, a 66 kHz switching frequency (half \nfrequency) can be selected by shorting the FREQUENCY pin \nto the CONTROL pin (Figure 11).  In addition, an example circuit shown in Figure 12 may be used to lower the switching frequency from 132 kHz in normal operation to 66 kHz in standby mode for very low standby power consumption.\nMULTI-FUNCTION (M) Pin Operation\nWhen current is fed into the MULTI-FUNCTION pin, it works as a voltage source of approximately 2.6 V up to a maximum current of +400 µ A (typical).  At +400 µ A, this pin turns into a \nconstant current sink. When current is drawn out of the MULTI-FUNCTION pin, it works as a voltage source of approximately 1.32 V up to a maximum current of –240 µ A \n(typical).  At –240 µ A, it turns into a constant current source.  \nRefer to Figure 9.\nThere are a total of five functions available through the use of \nthe MULTI-FUNCTION pin: OV, UV, line feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction, external current limit and remote ON/OFF.  A \nshort circuit between the MULTI-FUNCTION pin and SOURCE pin disables all five functions and forces TOPSwitch-FX to \noperate in a simple three terminal mode like TOPSwitch-II.  The \nMULTI-FUNCTION pin is typically used for line sensing by s\n        Figure Number \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThree Terminal Operation  \nUndervoltage\nOvervoltage\nLine Feed-forward (DCMAX)\nLine Feed-forward (ILIMIT)\n \nExternal Current Limit\nRemote ON/OFFconnecting a resistor from this pin to the rectified DC high-\nvoltage bus to implement OV, UV and DCMAX reduction with \nline voltage functions.  In this mode, the value of the resistor determines the line OV/UV thresholds, and the DC\nMAX is \nreduced linearly with rectified DC high-voltage starting from just above the UV threshold.  In high efficiency applications \nthis pin can be used in the external current limit mode instead, \nto reduce the current limit externally to a value close to the operating peak current, by connecting the pin to the SOURCE pin through a resistor.  The same pin can also be used as a \nremote on/off and a synchronization input in both modes.  \nPlease refer to Table 2 for possible combinations of the functions with example circuits shown in Figure 13 through Figure 23.  A description of specific functions in terms of the MULTI-FUNCTION pin I/V characteristic is shown in Figure 8.  \nThe horizontal axis represents MULTI-FUNCTION pin current \nwith positive polarity indicating currents flowing into the pin. The meaning of the vertical axes varies with functions. For those that control the on/off states of the output such as UV, \nOV and remote ON/OFF, the vertical axis represents the enable/\ndisable states of the output.  UV triggers at I\nUV (+50 µ A typical) \nand OV triggers at IOV (+225 µ A typical). Between +50 µ A and \n+225 µ A, the output is enabled.  For external current limit and \nline feed-forward with DCMAX reduction, the vertical axis \nrepresents the magnitude of the ILIMIT and DCMAX.  Line feed- \nforward with DCMAX reduction lowers maximum duty cycle \nfrom 78% at IM(DC) (+90 µ A typical) to 38% at IOV (+225 µ A).  \nExternal current limit is available only with negative MULTI-\nFUNCTION pin current.

C 06/1514\nTOP232-234\nwww.power.com Figure 24.  30 W Power Supply using External Current Limit.Application Examples \nA High Efficiency, 30 W, Universal Input Power Supply\nThe circuit shown in Figure 24 takes advantage of several of the TOPSwitch-FX features to reduce system cost and power \nsupply size and to improve efficiency.  This design delivers 30 W \nat 12 V, from an 85  to 265 VAC input, at an ambient of 50 ˚C, in an open frame configuration.  A nominal efficiency of 80% at full load is achieved using TOP234. \nThe current limit is externally set by resistors R1 and R2 to a \nvalue just above the low line operating peak current of approximately 70% of the default current limit.  This allows use of a smaller transformer core size and/or higher transformer \nprimary inductance for a given output power, reducing \nTOPSwitch-FX power dissipation, while at the same time avoiding transformer core saturation during startup and output transient conditions.  The resistor R1 provides a feed-forward \nsignal that reduces the current limit with increasing line \nvoltage, which, in turn, limits the maximum overload power at high input line voltage.  The feed-forward function in combination with the built-in soft-start feature of TOPSwitch-FX, allows the use of a low cost RCD clamp (R3, C3 and D1) \nwith a higher reflected voltage, by safely limiting the TOPSwitch-FX drain voltage, with adequate margin, under \nworst case conditions. The extended maximum duty cycle feature of TOPSwitch-FX (guaranteed minimum value of 75% vs. 64% for TOPSwitch-II) allows the use of a smaller input \ncapacitor (C1).  The extended maximum duty cycle and the \nhigher reflected voltage possible with the RCD clamp also permit the use of a higher primary to secondary turns ratio for T1 which reduces the peak reverse voltage experienced by the secondary rectifier D8.  As a result, a 60 V Schottky rectifier \ncan be used for up to 15 V outputs, which greatly improves \npower supply efficiency. The cycle skipping feature of the TOPSwitch-FX eliminates the need for any dummy loading for regulation at no load and reduces the no load/standby \nconsumption of the power supply. Frequency jitter provides \nimproved margin for conducted EMI meeting the CISPR 22 (FCC B) specification.\nA simple Zener sense circuit is used for low cost.  The output \nvoltage is determined by the Zener diode (VR2) voltage and \nthe voltage drops across the optocoupler (U2) LED and resistor R6. Resistor R8 provides bias current to Zener VR2 for typical regulation of ±5% at the 12 V output level, over line and \nload and component variations. \n12 V\n@ 2.5 A\nD2\n1N4148\nT1\nC5\n47 µF\n10 VU2\nLTV817A\nVR2\n1N5240C\n10 V, 2%R6\n150 ΩR15\n150 ΩC14\n1 nF\nD1\nUF4005R3\n68 kΩ\n2WC3\n4.7 nF\n1KV CY1\n2.2 nF\nU1\nTOP234YD M\nS FCTOPSwitch-FXR8\n150 Ω\nC1\n68 µF\n400 VC6\n100 nFD8\nMBR1060C10\n560 µF\n35 VC12\n220 µF\n35 VC11\n560 µF\n35 V\nCONTROLCONTROLRTN\nR5\n6.8 ΩR1\n4.7 MΩ\n1/2 W\nR2\n9.09 kΩ\nPI-2525-062515L3\n3.3 µH\nBR1\n600 V\n2A\nF1\n3.15 AJ1L1\n20 mH\nL\n \nNCX1\n100 nF\n250 VAC\nRev. C 06/1515\nTOP232-234\nwww.power.com Figure 25.  35 W Set-Top Box Power Supply.  35 W Multiple Output Power Supply\nFigure 25 shows a five output, 35 W, secondary regulated power supply utilizing a TOP233 for multiple output applications \nsuch as set-top box, VCR, DVD, etc.  The circuit shown is \ndesigned for a 230 VAC input but can be used over the universal range at a derated output power of 25 W. Alternatively, a doubler input stage can be used at 100 or 115 VAC for the \nfull power rating of 35 W. TOPSwitch-FX provides several \nadvantages in the above mentioned applications. \nA single line sense resistor R1 (2 M Ω) implements an under-\nvoltage detect (at 100 V), overvoltage shutdown (at 450 V) and \nline feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction features.  Under-\nvoltage detect ensures that the outputs are glitch free on \npower down. The over-voltage shutdown turns off the \nTOPSwitch-FX MOSFET above 450 V on the DC input rail, \neliminating reflected voltage and leakage inductance spikes, and hence, extending the surge withstand to the 700 VDC rating of the MOSFET. This feature prevents field failures in \ncountries where prolonged line voltage surges are common. \nThis design also takes advantage of soft-start and higher \noperating frequency to reduce transformer size.  A snubber circuit (R4,  C4) is used to slowdown dv/dt of the switching \nwaveform minimizing radiated video noise that could interfere \nwith TV reception.  The half frequency option of the TOPSwitch-FX can be used by connecting the FREQUENCY pin to the CONTROL pin instead of the SOURCE pin in video noise sensitive applications to allow for heavier snubbing without \nsignificant impact on efficiency. \nThis design achieves ±5% load regulation on 3.3 V and 5 V \noutputs using dual sensed optocoupler feedback through \nresistors R9, R10 and R11. Other output voltages are set by \nthe transformer turns ratio.  Output voltage on the low power -5 V output is shunt regulated by resistor R12 and Zener diode VR2.  Dummy load resistor R13 is required to maintain regulation of the 30 V output under light load conditions.  \nCompensation of the TL431 (U3) is achieved with resistor R8 \nand capacitor C7.  Primary side compensation and auto-restart frequency are determined by resistor R5 and capacitor C5.  Second stage LC post-filtering is used on the 3.3 V,  5 V \nand 18 V high power outputs (L2, L3, L4 and C13, C15, C17) \nfor low ripple.  Full load operating efficiency exceeds 75% across the AC input range. Primary clamp components VR1 and D1 limit peak drain voltage to a safe value.\nThe frequency jittering in TOPSwitch-FX helps reduce EMI, \nmaintaining emissions below CISPR 22 (FCC B) levels through proper choice of Y1 capacitor (CY1) and input filtering elements (CX1, L1).  To minimize coupling of common mode transients to \nthe TOP233, Y1 capacitor is tied to the positive input DC rail. \nLightning strike immunity to 3 kV is attained with the addition of a 275 V MOV (RV1).  \n5 V\n@ 2.5 A\n3.3 V@ 3 A\nRTN\nD2\n1N4148\nT1 U2\nLTV817\nU3\nTL431CLPC8\n22 µFR6\n51 Ω\nR11\n10.0 kΩC7\n0.1 µFR9\n9.53 kΩR10\n15.0 kΩ\nR8\n10 ΩR7\n510 ΩD8\nMUR120\nD9\nUF5402C12\n220 µF\n25 V CY1\n2.2 nF30 V\n@ 100 mA\n18 V@ 550 mA\nD1\nUF4007VR1\nP6KE200\nBR1\n400 V\nF1\n3.15 A\nRV1\n275 VJ1L1\n20 mH\nL\n \nNR5\n6.8 Ω\nC5\n47 µFC4\n47 pFU1\nTOP233YD M\nS FCTOPSwitch-FXR1\n2 MΩ\n1/2 WR13\n24 kΩ\nR4\n2 kΩC1\n33 µF\n400 V\nC6\n100 nFC10\n100 µF\n50 V\nD10\nMBR1045C14\n1000 µF\n25 VL3\n3.3 µH\nL4\n3.3 µHC15\n100 µF\n10 VC13\n100 µF\n25 VC11\n1 µF\n50 VL2\n3.3 µH\nD11\nBYW29-\n100C16\n1000 µF\n25 V\nC18\n330 µF\n10 VR12\n5 ΩD12\n1N5819-5 V\n@ 100 mA\nCX1\n0.1 µF\n250 VACC17\n100 µF\n10 V\nC19\n100 µF\n10 VVR2\n1N5231\nPI-2536-062515CONTROLCONTROL\nRev.

The \nsupply uses the TOP232 operating from 230 VAC or 100/ \n115 VAC with doubler input.  This design takes advantage of the soft-start, line under-voltage detect, tighter current limit variation and higher switching frequency features of \nTOPSwitch-FX. For example, the higher switching frequency \nwith tighter current limit variation allows use of an EE19 transformer core. Furthermore, the spacing between high-voltage DRAIN pin and low voltage pins of the TOPSwitch-FX packages provides large creepage distance which is a \nsignificant advantage in high pollution environments such as \nfan cooled PC power supplies.\nCapacitor C1 provides high frequency decoupling of the \nhigh-voltage DC supply, and is necessary only if there is a long \ntrace length from the source of the DC supply to the inputs of this standby circuit.  The line sense resistor R1 senses the DC input voltage for line undervoltage. When AC is turned off, the under-voltage detect feature of the TOPSwitch-FX  prevents \nauto-restart glitches at the output caused by the slow discharge of large storage capacitance in the main converter. This is achieved by turning the power supply off when the input voltage goes below a level needed to maintain output regulation and keeping it off until the input voltage goes above \nthe under-voltage threshold (V\nUV), when the AC is turned on \nagain. The under voltage threshold is set at 200\xa0VDC, slightly \nbelow the required lowest operating DC input voltage, for \nstart-up at 170\xa0VAC. This feature saves several components \nneeded to implement the glitch free turn off with discrete or  \nTOPSwitch-II based designs. \nThe bias winding is rectified and filtered by D2 and C6 to \ncreate a bias voltage for the TOP232 and to provide a 15\xa0V primary bias output voltage for the main power supply primary control circuitry.  Both 3.3\xa0V and 5\xa0V output voltages are sensed by R9, R10 and R11 using a TL431 (U3) circuit shown.  \nResistor R6 limits current through optocoupler U2 and sets \noverall AC control loop gain.  Resistor R7 assures that there is sufficient bias current for the TL431 when the optocoupler is at a minimum current.  Capacitor C8 provides a soft-finish \nfunction to eliminate turn-on overshoot.  The no load regulation \n(cycle-skipping) of TOPSwitch-FX permits the circuit to meet the low standby power requirement of the Blue Angel specification for PCs.\nFigure 26.  17 W PC Standby Supply.  3.3 V\n@ 2 A\n200 - 375 \nVDC\nD2\nBAV21\nT1\nC8\n10 µF\n35 VC11\n100 µF\n10 V\nC5\n47 µFU2\nSFH615-2\nU3\nTL431CLPC7\n0.1 µFR6\n301 Ω\nR9\n16.2 kΩD1\nUF4005VR1\nBZY97C-\n200\nU1\nTOP232YD M\nS FCTOPSwitch-FXR7\n510 ΩC1\n0.01 µF\n1 kV\n(optional)(Primary\nReferenced)\nC6\n35 VD4\nSB540D3\nSB5405 V\n@ 2 A\nC12\n1000 µF\n10 VC10\n1000 µF\n10 VCY1\n1 nF\n+\n–\nPI-2537-062515RTN\n    15 V\n@ 30 mA \nR5\n6.8 ΩR1\n3.9 MΩL2\n3.3 µHL1\n3.3 µH\nR10\n12.1 kΩ\nR11\n10 kΩC13\n100 µF\n10 V\nCONTROLCONTROL\nRev. C 06/1517\nTOP232-234\nwww.power.com Processor Controlled Supply Turn On/Off\nA low cost momentary contact switch can be used to turn the  TOPSwitch-FX power on and off under microprocessor control \nthat may be required in some applications such as printers.  \nThe low power remote off feature allows an elegant implemen-tation of this function with very few external components as shown in Figure 27. Whenever the push button momentary \ncontact switch P1 is closed by the user, the optocoupler U3 is \nactivated to inform the microprocessor of this action. Initially, when the power supply is off (M pin is floating), closing of P1 turns the power supply on by shorting the M pin of the TOPSwitch-FX to SOURCE through a diode (remote on). When \nthe secondary output voltage VCC is established, the micro-\nprocessor comes alive and recognizes that the switch P1 is closed through the switch status input that is driven by the optocoupler U3 output.  The microprocessor then sends a \npower supply control signal to hold the power supply in the \non-state through the optocoupler U4. If the user presses the switch P1 again to command a turn off, the microprocessor detects this through the optocoupler U3 and initiates a shutdown procedure that is product specific.  For example, in \nthe case of the inkjet printer, the shutdown procedure may \ninclude safely parking the print heads in the storage position.  In the case of products with a disk drive, the shutdown procedure may include saving data or settings to the disk. After the shutdown procedure is complete, when it is safe to \nturn off the power supply, the microprocessor releases the  \nM pin by turning the optocoupler U4 off. If the manual switch \nand the optocouplers U3 and U4 are not located close to the M pin, a capacitor C\nM may be needed to prevent noise \ncoupling to the pin when it is open.\nThe power supply could also be turned on remotely through a \nlocal area network or a parallel or serial port by driving the optocoupler U4 input LED with a logic signal.  Sometimes it is easier to send a train of logic pulses through a cable (due to \nAC coupling of cable, for example) instead of a DC logic level \nas a wake-up signal.  In this case, a simple RC filter can be used to generate a DC level to drive U4 (not shown in Figure 27).  This remote on feature can be used to wake-up peripherals such as printers, scanners, external modems, disk \ndrives, etc., as needed from a computer.  Peripherals are \nusually designed to turn off automatically if they are not being used for a period of time, to save power.\nFigure 27.  Remote ON/OFF using Microcontroller.

C 06/1518\nTOP232-234\nwww.power.com In addition to using a minimum number of components, \nTOPSwitch-FX provides many technical advantages in this type of application:\n1. Extremely low power consumption in the off mode: 80 mW typical at 110 VAC and 160 mW typical at 230 VAC. This is because in the remote/off mode the TOPSwitch-FX \nconsumes very little power, and the external circuitry does \nnot consume any current (M pin is open) from the high-voltage DC input.\n2. A very low cost, low voltage/current, momentary contact  \nswitch can be used.\n3. No debouncing circuitry for the momentary switch is required. During turn-on, the start-up time of the power supply (typically 10 to 20 ms) plus the microprocessor \ninitiation time act as a debouncing filter, allowing a turn-on \nonly if the switch is depressed firmly for at least the above delay time. During turn-off, the microprocessor initiates the shutdown sequence when it detects the first closure of the \nswitch, and subsequent bouncing of the switch has no \neffect.  If necessary, the microprocessor could implement the switch debouncing in software during turn-off, or a filter capacitor can be used at the switch status input.\n4. No external current limiting circuitry is needed for the operation of the U4 optocoupler output due to internal limiting of M pin current.\n5. No high-voltage resistors to the input DC voltage rail are required to power the external circuitry in the primary. Even the LED current for U3 can be derived from the CONTROL \npin. This not only saves components and simplifies layout, \nbut also eliminates the power loss associated with the high-voltage resistors in both on and off states.\n6. Robust design: There is no on/off latch that can be accidentally triggered by transients. Instead, the power supply is held in the on-state through the secondary side \nmicroprocessor. \nRev.

C 06/1520\nTOP232-234\nwww.power.com TOPSwitch-FX Design Considerations \nTOPSwitch-FX Selection\nSelecting the optimum TOPSwitch-FX  depends upon required \nmaximum output power, efficiency, heat sinking constraints and cost goals. With the option to externally reduce current limit, a larger TOPSwitch-FX  may be used for lower power \napplications where higher efficiency is needed or minimal heat \nsinking is available.\nInput Capacitor\nThe input capacitor must be chosen to provide the minimum  DC voltage required for the TOPSwitch-FX  converter to \nmaintain regulation at the lowest specified input voltage and \nmaximum output power.  Since TOPSwitch-FX has a higher \nDC\nMAX than TOPSwitch-II, it is possible to use a smaller input \ncapacitor.  For TOPSwitch-FX , a capacitance of 2 µ F per watt \nis usually sufficient for universal input with an appropriately \ndesigned transformer.Primary Clamp and Output Reflected Voltage VOR\nA primary clamp is necessary to limit the peak TOPSwitch-FX \ndrain to source voltage.  A Zener clamp (see Figure 26, VR1) requires few parts and takes up little board space. For good \nefficiency, the clamp Zener should be selected to be at least \n1.5 times the output reflected voltage V\nOR as this keeps the \nleakage spike conduction time short.  When using  a Zener clamp in a universal input application, a V\nOR of less than 135 V \nis recommended to allow for the absolute tolerances and temperature variations of the Zener.  This will ensure efficient \noperation of the clamp circuit and will also keep the maximum \ndrain voltage below the rated breakdown voltage of the TOPSwitch-FX  MOSFET.\nA high V\nOR  is required to take full advantage of the wider DCMAX \nof TOPSwitch-FX . An RCD clamp provides tighter clamp \nvoltage tolerance than a Zener clamp and allows a VOR as high \nas 165 V.   The VOR  can be  further increased in continuous \nmode designs up to 185 V by reducing the external current limit as a function of input line voltage (see Figure 18).  The \nRCD clamp is more cost effective than the Zener clamp but \nrequires more careful design (see quick design checklist). *Not available\nTable 3 (cont).

C 06/1521\nTOP232-234\nwww.power.com Output Diode\nThe output diode is selected for peak inverse voltage, output current, and thermal conditions in the application (including \nheat sinking, air circulation, etc.). The higher DC\nMAX of \nTOPSwitch-FX  along with an appropriate transformer turns \nratio can allow the use of a 60 V Schoktty diode for higher efficiency on output voltages as high as 15 V (See Figure 24.  \nA 12 V, 30 W design using a 60 V Schottky for the output diode).\nSoft-Start\nGenerally a power supply experiences maximum stress at \nstart-up before the feedback loop achieves regulation.  For a period of 10 ms the on-chip soft-start linearly increases the duty cycle from zero to the default DC\nMAX at turn on, which \ncauses the primary current and output voltage to rise in an orderly manner allowing time for the feedback loop to take \ncontrol of the duty cycle.  This reduces the stress on the \nTOPSwitch-FX  MOSFET, clamp circuit and output diode(s), \nand helps prevent transformer saturation during start-up. Also, soft-start limits the amount of output voltage overshoot, and in \nmany applications eliminates the need for a soft-finish \ncapacitor.\nEMI \nThe frequency jitter feature modulates the switching frequency over a narrow band as a means to reduce conducted EMI \npeaks associated with the harmonics of the fundamental \nswitching frequency.  This is particularly beneficial for average detection mode.  As can be seen in Figure 28, the benefits of jitter increase with the order of the switching harmonic due to \nan increase in frequency deviation.\nThe FREQUENCY pin of TOPSwitch-FX offers a switching \nfrequency option of 132 kHz or 66 kHz. In applications that require heavy snubbers on the drain node for reducing high \nfrequency radiated noise (for example, video noise sensitive \napplications such as VCR, DVD, monitor, TV, etc.), operating at 66 kHz will reduce snubber loss resulting in better efficiency.  Also, in applications where transformer size is not a concern, \nuse of the 66 kHz option will provide lower EMI and higher \nefficiency.  Note that the second harmonic of 66 kHz is still below 150 kHz, above which the conducted EMI specifications get much tighter. \nFor 10 W or below, it is possible to use a simple inductor in \nplace of a more costly AC input common mode choke to meet worldwide conducted EMI limits.\nTransformer Design\nIt is recommended that the transformer be designed for \nmaximum operating flux density of 3000 gauss and a peak flux density of 4200 gauss at maximum current limit.  The turns ratio should be chosen for a reflected voltage (V\nOR) no \ngreater than 135 V when Switching Harmonic\nPI-2559-093099Noise Reduction (dB)  Quasi-Peak Average\n-20-100-1020304050607080\n0.15 1 10 30\nFrequency (MHz)Amplitude (dBµV)\nPI-2576-062615\nVFG243B (QP)\nVF646B (AV)TOPSwitch-II (no jitter)\nVFG243B (QP)\nVF646B (AV)\n-20-100-1020304050607080\n0.15 1 10 30\nFrequency (MHz)Amplitude (dBµV)\nPI-2577-062615TOPSwitch-FX (with jitter)(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 28.

C 06/1523\nTOP232-234\nwww.power.com using a Zener clamp, 165 V when using an RCD clamp and  \n185 V when using RCD clamp with current limit feed-forward.\nFor designs where operating current is significantly lower than \nthe default current limit, it is recommended to use an externally set current limit close to the operating peak current to reduce peak flux density and peak power (see Figure 17). In most \napplications, the tighter current limit tolerance, higher switching \nfrequency and soft-start features of TOPSwitch-FX  contribute \nto a smaller transformer when compared to TOPSwitch-II . \nStandby ConsumptionCycle skipping can significantly reduce power loss at zero \nload, especially when a Zener clamp is used. For very low \nsecondary power consumption use a TL431 regulator for feedback control. Alternately, switching losses can be significantly reduced by switching from 132 kHz in normal \noperation to 66 kHz under light load conditions.\nTOPSwitch-FX Layout ConsiderationsPrimary Side Connections\nUse a single point (Kelvin) connection at the negative terminal of the input filter capacitor for TOPSwitch-FX SOURCE pin and \nbias winding return. This improves surge capabilities by \nreturning surge currents from the bias winding directly to the input filter capacitor.\nThe CONTROL pin bypass capacitor should be located as \nclose as possible to the SOURCE and CONTROL pins and its SOURCE connection trace should not be shared by the main MOSFET switching currents.\nAll SOURCE pin referenced components connected to the  \nMULTI-FUNCTION pin should also be located close to  \nSOURCE and MULTI-FUNCTION pins with dedicated \nSOURCE pin connection.  The MULTI-FUNCTION pin’s trace \nshould be kept as short as possible and away from the DRAIN \ntrace to prevent noise coupling.  Line sense resistor (R1 in Figures 29 and 30) should be located close to the MULTI-FUNCTION pin to minimize the trace length on the MULTI-FUNCTION pin side.\nIn addition to the 47 µ F CONTROL pin capacitor, a high \nfrequency bypass capacitor in parallel may be used for better \nnoise immunity.  The feedback optocoupler output should also \nbe located close to the CONTROL and SOURCE pins of \nTOPSwitch-FX .\nY-CapacitorThe Y-capacitor should be connected close to the secondary output return pin(s) and the primary DC input pin of the \ntransformer (see Figures 29 and 30).\nHeat Sinking\nThe tab of the Y package (TO-220) is internally electrically  tied to the SOURCE pin. To avoid circulating currents, a heat \nsink attached to the tab should not be electrically tied to any \nnodes on the PC board.When using P (DIP-8) or G (SMD-8) packages, a copper area underneath the package connected to the SOURCE pins will act as an effective heat sink. \n \nIn addition, sufficient copper area should be provided at the anode and cathode leads of the output diode(s) for heat sinking.\nQuick Design Checklist\nAs with any power supply design, all TOPSwitch-FX designs \nshould be verified on the bench to make sure that components specifications are not exceeded under worst case conditions. The following minimum set of tests is strongly recommended:\n1. M aximum drain voltage – Verify that peak VDS does not \nexceed 675 V at highest input voltage and maximum overload output power. Maximum overload output power \noccurs when the ouput is overloaded to a level just before \nthe power supply goes into auto-restart (loss of regulation).\n2. M aximum drain current – At maximum ambient \ntemperature, maximum input voltage and maximum output load, verify drain current waveforms at start-up for any signs of transformer saturation and excessive leading edge \ncurrent spikes.  TOPSwitch-FX has a leading edge blanking \ntime of 200 ns to prevent premature termination of the \non-cycle.  Verify that the leading edge current spike is below the allowed current limit envelope (see Figure 33) for \nthe drain current waveform at the end of the 200 ns \nblanking period.\n3. T hermal check – At maximum output power, minimum \ninput voltage and maximum ambient temperature, verify that temperature specifications are not exceeded for  \nTOPSwitch-FX, transformer, output diodes and output \ncapacitors.  Enough thermal margin should be allowed for \nthe part-to-part variation of the R\nDS(ON) of TOPSwitch-FX as \nspecified in the data sheet.  The margin required can either be calculated from the tolerances or it can be accounted \nfor by connecting an external resistance in series with the \nDRAIN pin and attached to the same heat sink, having a resistance value that is equal to the difference between the measured R\nDS(ON) of the device under test and the worst \ncase maximum specification.\nDesign Tools\n1.

The schematic shown in Figure 34 is suggested for laboratory \ntesting of TOPSwitch-FX. \n When the DRAIN pin supply is turned on, the part will be in the auto-restart mode.  The CONTROL pin voltage will be \noscillating at a low frequency between 4.8 and 5.8 V and the \ndrain is turned on every eighth cycle of the CONTROL pin oscillation.  If the CONTROL pin power supply is turned on BENCH TEST PRECAUTIONS FOR EVALUATION OF ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nTypical Performance Characteristicswhile in this auto-restart mode, there is only a 12.5% chance that the CONTROL pin oscillation will be in the correct state (drain active state) so that the continuous drain voltage \nwaveform may be observed.  It is recommended that the V\nC \npower supply be turned on first and the DRAIN pin power \nsupply second if continuous drain voltage waveforms are to be \nobserved.  The 12.5% chance of being in the correct state is \ndue to the divide-by-8 counter.  Temporarily shorting the CONTROL pin to the SOURCE pin will reset TOPSwitch-FX , \nwhich then will come up in the correct state.\n.3.4.5.6.7.8.91.0\n-250 -200 -150 -100 -50 0\nIM (µA)Current Limit (A)CURRENT LIMIT vs. MULTI-FUNCTION\nPIN CURRENT\nPI-2540-033001\n6080100120140160180200\ndi/dt (mA/µs)\nTOP234   1.50\nTOP233   1.00TOP232   0.50Scaling Factors:\n.3.4.5.6.7.8.91.01.1\n6080100120140160180200\n05 K 10K 15K 20K 25K\nExternal Current Limit Resistor RIL (Ω)Current Limit (A)\ndi/dt (mA/µs)CURRENT LIMIT vs.  EXTERNAL\nCURRENT LIMIT RESISTANCE\nPI-2539-033001\n30KMaximum and minimum levels \nare based on characterization.
