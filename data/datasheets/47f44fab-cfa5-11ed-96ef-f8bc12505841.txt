Virtex-4 devices implement the following function-ality:\n\x81 I/O blocks provide the interface between package pins \nand the internal configurable logic. Most popular and leading-edge I/O standards are supported by programmable I/O blocks (IOBs). The IOBs are enhanced for source-synchronous applications. Source-synchronous optimizations include per-bit deskew, data serializer/deserializer, clock dividers, and dedicated local clocking resources.\n\x81 Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs), the basic logic \nelements for Xilinx FPGAs, provide combinatorial and synchronous logic as well as distributed memory and SRL16 shift register capability.\n\x81 Block RAM modules provid e flexible 18Kbit true \ndual-port RAM, that are cascadable to form larger memory blocks. In addition, Virtex-4 FPGA block RAMs contain optional programmable FIFO logic for increased device utilization.\n\x81 Cascadable embedded XtremeDSP slices with 18-bit x \n18-bit dedicated multipliers, integrated Adder, and 48-bit accumulator.\x81 Digital Clock Manager (DCM) blocks provide \nself-calibrating, fully digital solutions for clock distribution delay compensation, clock multiplication/division, and coarse-/fine-grained clock phase shifting.\nAdditionally, FX devices support the following embedded\nsystem functionality:\n\x81 Integrated high-speed serial transceivers enable data \nrates up to 6.5 Gb/s per channel.\n\x81 Embedded IBM PowerPC 405 Processor RISC CPU \n(up to 450 MHz) with the auxiliary processor unit interface\n\x81 10/100/1000 Ethernet media-access control (EMAC) \ncores.\nThe general routing matrix (GRM) provides an array of rout-\ning switches between each component. Each programma-ble element is tied to a switch matrix, allowing multipleconnections to the general routing matrix. The overall pro-grammable interconnection is hierarchical and designed tosupport high-speed designs.\nAll programmable elements, including the routing\nresources, are controlled by values stored in static memorycells. These values are loaded in the memory cells duringconfiguration and can be reloaded to change the functionsof the programmable elements.\nVirtex-4 FPGA Features\nThis section briefly describes the features of the Virtex-4 family of FPGAs.\nInput/Output (SelectIO) Blocks\nIOBs are programmable and can be categorized as follows:\n\x81 Programmable single-ended or differential (LVDS) \noperation\n\x81 Input block with an optional single data rate (SDR) or \ndouble data rate (DDR) register\n\x81 Output block with an optional SDR or DDR register\x81 Bidirectional block\x81 Per-bit deskew circuitry\x81 Dedicated I/O and regional clocking resources\n\x81 Built in data se rializer/deserializer\nThe IOB registers are either edge-triggered D-type flip-flops\nor level-sensitive latches.\nIOBs support the following single-ended standards:\x81 LVTTL\n\x81 LVCMOS (3.3V, 2.5V, 1.8V, and 1.5V)\x81 PCI (33 and 66 MHz)\x81P C I - X\x81 GTL and GTLP\x81 HSTL 1.5V and 1.8V (Class I, II, III, and IV)\n\x81 SSTL 1.8V and 2.5V (Class I and II)\nThe DCI I/O feature can be configured to provide on-chip\ntermination for each single-ended I/O standard and somedifferential I/O standards.\nThe IOB elements also support the following differential sig-\nnaling I/O standards:\n\x81 LVDS and Extended LVDS (2.5V only)\n\x81 BLVDS (Bus LVDS)\x81U L V D S\x81 Hypertransport™\x81 Differential HSTL 1.5V and 1.8V (Class II)\x81 Differential SSTL 1.8V and 2.5V (Class II)\nTwo adjacent pads are used for each differential pair. Two or\nfour IOB blocks connect to one switch matrix to access therouting resources.\nPer-bit deskew circuitry allows for programmable signal\ndelay internal to the FPGA. Per-bit deskew flexibly providesfine-grained increments of delay to carefully produce a\nVirtex-4 Family Overview\nDS112 (v3.1) August 30, 2010 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 5R\nrange of signal delays. This is especially useful for synchro-\nnizing signal edges in source synchronous interfaces.\nGeneral purpose I/O in select locations (four per bank) are\ndesigned to be “regional clock capable” I/O by adding spe-cial hardware connections for I/ O in the same locality. These\nregional clock inputs are distributed within a limited regionto minimize clock skew between IOBs. Regional I/O clock-ing supplements the global clocking resources.\nData serializer/des erializer capability is added to every I/O\nto support source synchronous interfaces. A serial-to-paral-lel converter with associated cloc k divider is included in the\ninput path, and a parallel-to-serial converter in the outputpath.\nAn in-depth guide to the Virtex-4 FPGA IOB is discussed in\nthe Virtex-4 FPGA User Guide .\nConfigurable Log ic Blocks (CLBs)\nA CLB resource is made up of four slices. Each slice is\nequivalent and contains:\n\x81 Two function generators (F & G)\n\x81 Two storage elements\x81 Arithmetic logic gates\x81 Large multiplexers\x81 Fast carry look-ahead chain\nThe function generators F & G are configurable as 4-input\nlook-up tables (LUTs). Two slices in a CLB can have theirLUTs configured as 16-bit shift registers, or as 16-bit distrib-uted RAM. In addition, the two storage elements are eitheredge-triggered D-type flip-flops  or level sensitive latches.\nEach CLB has internal fast interconnect and connects to aswitch matrix to access general routing resources.\nThe Virtex-4 FPGA CLBs are further discussed in the\nVirtex-4 FPGA User Guide .\nBlock RAM\nThe block RAM resources are 18 Kb true dual-port RAM\nblocks, programmable from 16K x 1 to 512 x 36, in variousdepth and width configurations. Each port is totally synchro-nous and independent, offering three “read-during-write”modes. Block RAM is cascadable to implement largeembedded storage blocks. Additionally, back-end pipelineregisters, clock control circuitry, built-in FIFO support, andbyte write enable are new features supported in the Virtex-4FPGA.\nThe block RAM feature in Virtex-4 devices is further dis-\ncussed in the Virtex-4 FPGA User Guide .XtremeDSP Slices\nThe XtremeDSP slices contain a dedicated 18 x 18-bit 2’s\ncomplement signed multiplier, adder logic, and a 48-bitaccumulator. Each multiplier or accumulator can be usedindependently. These blocks are designed to implementextremely efficient and high-speed DSP applications.\nThe block DSP feature in Virtex-4 devices are further dis-\ncussed in XtremeDSP Design Considerations .\nGlobal Clocking\nThe DCM and global-clock mu ltiplexer buffers provide a\ncomplete solution for designing high-speed clock networks.\nUp to twenty DCM blocks are available. To generate\ndeskewed internal or external clocks, each DCM can beused to eliminate clock distribution delay. The DCM alsoprovides 90°, 180°, and 270° phase-shifted versions of theoutput clocks. Fine-grained phase shifting offers higher res-olution phase adjustment with fraction of the clock periodincrements. Flexible frequen cy synthesis provides a clock\noutput frequency equal to a fractional or integer multiple ofthe input clock frequency. \nVirtex-4 devices have 32 global-clock MUX buffers. The\nclock tree is designed to be differential. Differential clockinghelps reduce jitter and duty cycle distortion.\nRouting Resources\nAll components in Virtex-4 devices use the same intercon-\nnect scheme and the same access to the global routingmatrix. Timing models are shared, greatly improving thepredictability of th e performance for hi gh-speed designs.\nBoundary-Scan\nBoundary-Scan instructions and associated data registers\nsupport a standard methodology for accessing and config-\nuring Virtex-4 devices, complying with IEEE standards\n1149.1 and 1532.\nConfiguration\nVirtex-4 devices are configured by loading the bitstream intointernal configuration memory using one of the followingmodes:\n\x81 Slave-serial mode\n\x81 Master-serial mode\x81 Slave SelectMAP mode\x81 Master SelectMAP mode\x81 Boundary-Scan mode (IEEE-1532)\nOptional 256-bit AES de cryption is supported on-chip (with\nsoftware bitstream encryption) providing Intellectual Prop-erty security.\nVirtex-4 Family Overview\nDS112 (v3.1) August 30, 2010 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 6R\nVirtex-4 FX Family\nThis section briefly describes blocks available only in FX devices.\nRocketIO Multi- Gigabit Transceiver\n8 – 24 Channels RocketIO Multi-Gigabit Serial Transceivers\n(MGTs) capable of running 622 Mb/s – 6.5 Gb/s\n\x81 Full Clock and Data Recovery\n\x81 32-bit or 40-bit datapath support\x81 Optional 8B/10B, 64B/66B, or FPGA-based \nencode/decode\n\x81 Integrated FIFO/Elastic Buffer\x81 Support for Channel Bonding \x81 Embedded 32-bit CRC generation/checking\n\x81 Integrated Comma-detect or programmable A1/A2, \nA1A1/A2A2 detection\n\x81 Programmable pre-emphasis (AKA transmitter \nequalization)\n\x81 Programmable receiver equalization\x81 Embedded support for:\n- Out of Band (OOB) Signalling: Serial ATA\n- Beaconing and Electrical Idle: PCI-Express™\n\x81 On-chip bypassable AC coupling for receiverOne or Two PowerPC 405 Processor Cores\n\x81 32-bit Harvard Architecture\n\x81 5-Stage Execution Pipeline\x81 Integrated 16KB Level 1 Instruction Cache and 16KB \nLevel 1 Data Cache\n\x81 Integrated Level 1 Cache Parity Generation and \nChecking\n\x81 CoreConnect™ Bus Architecture\x81 Efficient, high-performance on-chip memory (OCM) \ninterface to block RAM\n\x81 PLB Synchronization Logic (Enables Non-Integer \nCPU-to-PLB Clock Ratios)\n\x81 Auxiliary Processor Unit (APU ) Interface and Integrated \nAPU Controller\n- Optimized FPGA-based Coprocessor connection\n- Automatic decode of PowerPC floating-point instructions \n— allows custom instructions (decode for up to eight \ninstructions)\n- Extremely efficient microc ontroller-style interfacing\nTwo or Four Tri-Mode (10/10 0/1000 Mb/s) Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) Cores\n\x81 IEEE 802.3-2000 Compliant\n\x81 MII/GMII Interface or SGMII (when used with RocketIO \nTransceivers)\n\x81 Can Operate Independent of PowerPC processor\x81 Half- or Full-Duplex\n\x81 Supports Jumbo Frames\x81 1000Base-X PCS/PMA: Wh en used with RocketIO \nMGT can provide complete 1000Base-X implementation on-chip\nIntellectual Property Cores\nXilinx offers IP cores for co mmonly used complex functions\nincluding DSP , bus interfaces, processors, and processorperipherals.
