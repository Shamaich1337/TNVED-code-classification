A Type II tracking loop is employed to track the \ninputs and convert the input Sin and Cos information into a digital \nrepresentation of the input angle and velocity. The maximum \ntracking rate is a function of the external clock frequency. The performance of the AD2S105 is specified across a frequency range of 8.192 MHz ± 25%, allowing a maximum tracking rate \nof 1250 rps.  PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Ratiometric Tracking Conversion. The Type II tracking \nloop provides continuous output position data without \nconversion delay. It also provides noise immunity and \ntolerance of harmonic distortion on the reference and \ninput signals.  \n2. System Fault Detection.

Classical Resolver vs. Variable Reluctance Resolver \n \nA classical resolver is a rotating transformer that typically has a \nprimary winding on the rotor and two secondary windings on \nthe stator. A variable reluctance resolver, on the other hand, has the \nprimary and secondary windings on the stator and no windings on the rotor, as shown in Figure 3 ; however, the saliency in this \nrotor design provides the sinusoidal variation in the secondary coupling with the angular position. For both designs, the resolver output voltages (S3 − S1, S2 − S4) are as follows: \nSinθ t Sin E S1 S30× ω = −) (  (1) \nCosθ t Sin E S4 S20× ω = −) (  \nwhere:  \nθ is the shaft angle. \nSin(ωt)  is the rotor excitation frequency. \nE0 is the rotor excitation amplitude. \n The stator windings are displaced mechanically by 90° (see \nFigure 3 ). The primary winding is excited with an ac reference. \nThe amplitude of subsequent coupling onto the secondary windings is a function of the position of the rotor (shaft) relative to the stator. The resolver therefore produces two output voltages (S3 − S1, S2 − S4), modulated by the sine and cosine of the shaft angle. Resolver format signals refer to the \nsignals derived from the output of a resolver, as shown in \nEquation 1. Figure 4  illustrates the output format. \n06339-004\n0°S2 – S4\n(COSINE)\nS3 – S1\n(SINE)\nR2 – R4\n(REFERENCE)\n90° 180°\nθ270° 360°\n \nFigure 4. Electrical Resolver Representation \n \n \n \n  AD2S1205\n \nRev. A | Page 9 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD2S1205’s operation is based on a Type II tracking closed-\nloop principle. The digitally implemented tracking loop continually \ntracks the position and velocity of the resolver without the need for external convert and wait states. As the resolver moves through a position equivalent to the least significant bit weighting, the \ntracking loop output is updated by 1 LSB.  \nThe converter tracks the shaft angle (θ) by producing an output \nangle (ϕ) that is fed back and compared with the input angle \n(θ); the difference between the two angles is the error, which is \ndriven towards 0 when the converter is correctly tracking the \ninput angle. To measure the error, S3 − S1 is multiplied by Cosϕ \nand S2 − S4 is multiplied by Sinϕ to give \nS4  S2 for ) (S1 S3 for ) (\n00\n− ×− ×\nSinφ Cosθ ωt Sin ECosφ Sinθ ωt Sin E\n (2) \nThe difference is taken, giving \n) ( ) (0 Sinφ Cosθ Cos Sinθ ωt Sin E−φ ×  (3) \nThis signal is demodulated using the internally generated \nsynthetic reference, yielding \n) (0 φ−φ Sin Cosθ Cos Sinθ E  (4) \nEquation 4 is equivalent to E0Sin(θ − ϕ), which is approximately \nequal to E0(θ − ϕ) for small values of θ − ϕ, where θ  − ϕ is the \nangular error.  \nThe value E 0(θ − ϕ) is the difference between the angular error \nof the rotor and the digital angle output of the converter.  \nA phase-sensitive demodulator, some integrators, and a compen-\nsation filter form a closed-loop system that seeks to null the \nerror signal. If this is accomplished, ϕ equals the resolver angle, \nθ, within the rated accuracy of the converter. A Type II tracking loop is used so that constant velocity inputs can be tracked \nwithout inherent error. \nFor more information about the operation of the converter, see \nthe Circuit Dynamics  section. \nFAULT DETECTION CIRCUIT \nThe AD2S1205 fault detection circuit can sense loss of resolver \nsignals, out-of-range input signals, input signal mismatch, or \nloss of position tracking; however, the position indicated by  the AD2S1205 may differ significantly from the actual shaft \nposition of the resolver. MONITOR SIGNAL \nThe AD2S1205 generates a monitor signal by comparing the \nangle in the position register to the incoming Sin and Cos signals \nfrom the resolver. The monitor signal is created in a similar fashion to the error signal (described in the Theory of Operation  section). \nThe incoming Sinθ and Cosθ signals are multiplied by the Sin  and Cos of the output angle, respectively, and then these values \nare added together: \n) ( ) ( Cosφ Cosθ A2 Sinφ Sinθ A1 Monitor\n×× + × ×=  (5) \nwhere: \nA1 is the amplitude of the incoming Sin signal ( A1 × Sinθ). \nA2 is the amplitude of the incoming Cos signal ( A2 × Cosθ ). \nθ is the resolver angle. \nϕ is the angle stored in the position register.  \nNote that Equation 5 is shown after demodulation with the carrier signal Sin(ωt) removed. Also note that for a matched \ninput signal (that is, a no fault condition), A1 is equal to A2. \nWhen A1 is equal to A2 and the converter is tracking \n(therefore, θ is equal to ϕ), the monitor signal output has a \nconstant magnitude of A1 (Monitor  = A1  × (Sin\n2θ + Cos2θ) = A1 ), \nwhich is independent of the shaft angle. When A1 does not \nequal A2, the monitor signal magnitude alternates between A1 \nand A2 at twice the rate of the shaft rotation. The monitor \nsignal is used to detect degradation or loss of input signals. \nLOSS OF SIGNAL DETECTION \nLoss of signal (LOS) is detected when either resolver input (Sin \nor Cos) falls below the specified LOS Sin/Cos threshold. The \nAD2S1205 detects this by comparing the monitor signal to a fixed minimum value. Without the use of external circuitry,  \nthe AD2S1205 can detect the loss of up to three of the four \nconnections from the resolver. The addition of two external 68 kΩ resistors, as outlined in Figure 5 , ensures that the loss of \nall 4 connections, that is, complete removal of the resolver, may also be detected. LOS is indicated by both DOS and LOT latching as logic low outputs. The DOS and LOT pins are  \nreset to the no fault state by a rising edge of SAMPLE\n. The  \nLOS condition has priority over both the DOS and LOT \nconditions, as shown in . LOS is indicated within 57°  \nof the angular output error (worst case). Table 4\nAD2S1205  \n \nRev. A | Page 10 of 20 SIGNAL DEGRADATION DETECTION \nDegradation of signal (DOS) is detected when either resolver input \n(Sin or Cos) exceeds the specified DOS Sin/Cos threshold. The \nAD2S1205 detects this by comparing the monitor signal to a fixed maximum value. In addition, DOS is detected when the \namplitudes of the Sin and Cos input signals are mismatched  \nby more than the specified DOS Sin/Cos mismatch. This is identified because the AD2S1205 continuously stores the minimum and maximum magnitude of the monitor signal in internal registers and calculates the difference between these values. DOS is indicated by a logic low on the DOS pin and is \nnot latched when the input signals exceed the maximum input \nlevel. When DOS is indicated due to mismatched signals, the \noutput is latched low until a rising edge of SAMPLE\n resets the \nstored minimum and maximum values. The DOS condition has \npriority over the LOT condition, as shown in . DOS is \nindicated within 33° of the angular output error (worst case). Table 4\nLOSS OF POSITION TRACKING DETECTION \nLoss of tracking (LOT) is detected when \n• The internal error signal of the AD2S1205 exceeds 5°. \n• The input signal exceeds the maximum tracking rate. \n• The internal position (at the position integrator) differs from the external position (at the position register) by more than 5°. \nLOT is indicated by a logic low on the LOT pin and is not latched. LOT has a 4° hysteresis and is not cleared until the \ninternal error signal or internal/external position mismatch  \nis less than 1°. When the maximum tracking rate is exceeded, LOT is cleared only if the velocity is less than the maximum tracking rate and the internal/external position mismatch is  less than 1°. LOT can be indicated for step changes in position \n(such as after a RESET\n signal is applied to the AD2S1205), or \nfor accelerations of >~65,000 rps2. It is also useful as a built-in \ntest to indicate that the tracking converter is functioning \nproperly. The LOT condition has lower priority than both the DOS and LOS conditions, as shown in . The LOT and \nDOS conditions cannot be indicated at the same time. Table 4\nTable 4.

Even  \nif a RESET  or SAMPLE  pulse releases the fault condition and  \nis not immediately followed by another fault, the output data \nmay be corrupted. As discussed previously, there are some fault conditions with inherent latency. If the device fault is cleared, \nthere may be some latency in the resolver’s mechanical position \nbefore the fault condition is reindicated. \nWhen a fault is indicated, all output pins still provide data, although \nthe data may or may not be valid. The fault condition does not force the parallel, serial, or encoder outputs to a known state.  \nResponse to specific fault conditions is a system-level requirement. \nThe fault outputs of the AD2S1205 indicate that the device has sensed a potential problem with either the internal or external \nsignals of the AD2S1205. It is the responsibility of the system designer to implement the appropriate fault-handling schemes within the control hardware and/or algorithm of a given appli-cation based on the indicated fault(s) and the velocity or position \ndata provided by the AD2S1205. \nFALSE NULL CONDITION \nResolver-to-digital converters that employ Type II tracking loops \nbased on the previously stated error equation (see Equation 4  \nin the Theory of Operation  section) can suffer from a condition \nknown as a false null. This condition is caused by a metastable \nsolution to the error equation when θ − ϕ = 180°. The AD2S1205 \nis not susceptible to this condition because its hysteresis is implemented external to the tracking loop. As a result of the loop architecture chosen for the AD2S1205, the internal error signal constantly has some movement (1 LSB per clock cycle); therefore, in a metastable state, the converter moves to an \nunstable condition within one clock cycle. This causes the tracking \nloop to respond to the false null condition as if it were a 180° step change in input position (the response time is the same, as specified in the Dynamic Performance section of Table 1 ). \nTherefore, it is impossible to enter the metastable condition \nafter the start-up sequence if the resolver signals are valid.  \n  AD2S1205\n \nRev. A | Page 11 of 20 ON-BOARD PROGRAMMABLE SINUSOIDAL \nOSCILLATOR \nAn on-board oscillator provides the sinusoidal excitation signal \n(EXC) and its complement signal ( EXC ) to the resolver. The fre-\nquency of this reference signal is programmable to four standard \nfrequencies (10 kHz, 12 kHz, 15 kHz, or 20 kHz) by using the FS1 and FS2 pins (see ). FS1 and FS2 have internal pull-ups, \nso the default frequency is 10 kHz. The amplitude of this signal \nis centered on 2.5 V and has an amplitude of 3.6 V p-p. Table 5\nTable 5. Excitation Frequency Selection \nFrequency Selection (kHz) FS1  FS2  \n10  1  1  \n12  1  0  \n15  0  1  \n20  0  0  \n \nThe frequency of the reference signal is a function of the CLKIN \nfrequency. By decreasing the CLKIN frequency, the minimum \nexcitation frequency can also be decreased. This allows an \nexcitation frequency of 7.5 kHz to be set when using a CLKIN \nfrequency of 6.144 MHz, and it also decreases the maximum \ntracking rate to 750 rps.  \nThe reference output of the AD2S1205 requires an external buffer \namplifier to provide gain and additional current to drive the \nresolver. See Figure 6  for a suggested buffer circuit. \nThe AD2S1205 also provides an internal synchronous reference \nsignal that is phase locked to its Sin and Cos inputs. Phase errors \nbetween the resolver’s primary and secondary windings may degrade the accuracy of the RDC and are compensated for by using this synchronous reference signal. This also compensates for the phase shifts due to temperature and cabling, and it eliminates the need for an external preset phase-compensation circuit. \nSYNTHETIC REFERENCE GENERATION \nWhen a resolver undergoes a high rotation rate, the RDC tends \nto act as an electric motor and produces speed voltages in \naddition to the ideal Sin and Cos outputs. These speed voltages are in quadrature to the main signal waveform. Moreover, nonzero resistance in the resolver windings causes a nonzero phase shift between the reference input and the Sin and Cos outputs. The \ncombination of the speed voltages and the phase shift causes a \ntracking error in the RDC that is approximated by \nFrequency ReferenceRate RotationShift Phase Error × =  (6) \nTo compensate for the described phase error between the resolver \nreference excitation and the Sin/Cos signals, an internal synthetic \nreference signal is generated in phase with the reference frequency \ncarrier. The synthetic reference is derived using the internally filtered Sin and Cos signals. It is generated by determining the zero crossing of either the Sin or Cos (whichever signal is larger), which improves phase accuracy, and evaluating the phase of the resolver reference excitation. The synthetic reference reduces the phase shift between the reference and Sin/Cos inputs to less than 10° and can operate for phase shifts of ±45°. \nCHARGE-PUMP OUTPUT \nA 204.8 kHz square wave output with a 50% duty cycle is available \nat the CPO pin of the AD2S1205. This square wave output can \nbe used for negative rail voltage generation or to create a V CC rail. \nCONNECTING THE CONVERTER \nGround is connected to the AGND and DGND pins (see Figure 5 ). \nA positive power supply (V DD) of 5 V dc ± 5% is connected to \nthe AV DD and DV DD pins, with typical values for the decoupling \ncapacitors being 10 nF and 4.7 μF. These capacitors are then \nplaced as close to the device pins as possible and are connected to both AV\nDD and DV DD. If desired, the reference oscillator \nfrequency can be changed from the nominal value of 10 kHz using FS1 and FS2. Typical values for the oscillator decoupling capacitors are 20 pF, whereas typical values for the reference decoupling capacitors are 10 μF and 0.01 μF. As outlined in the Loss of Signal Detection  section 68 kΩ resistors between the Sin \nand SinLO inputs and the Cos and CosLO inputs can be used to ensure loss of signal detection when all four inputs from resolver \nare disconnected. \nIn this recommended configuration, the converter introduces a \nV\nREF/2 offset in the Sin and Cos signal outputs from the resolver. \nThe SinLO and CosLO signals can each be connected to a different \npotential relative to ground if the Sin and Cos signals adhere to the \nrecommended specifications. Note that because the EXC and EXC  \noutputs are differential, there is an inherent gain of 2×.  \nshows a suggested buffer circuit. Capacitor C1 may be used in \nparallel with Resistor R2 to filter out any noise that may exist on the \nEXC and Figure 6\nEXC  outputs. Care should be taken when selecting the \ncutoff frequency of this filter to ensure that phase shifts of the \ncarrier caused by the filter do not exceed the phase lock range  \nof the AD2S1205. \nThe gain of the circuit is \n)) 1 /( 1 ( ) / ( ω C1 R2 R1 R2 n CarrierGai ×× + × −=   (7) \nand \n⎟⎠⎞⎜⎝⎛× × + × − ⎟\n⎠⎞⎜\n⎝⎛⎟⎠⎞⎜⎝⎛+ × =IN REF OUT V ω C1 R2R1R2\nR1R2V V )) 1 /( 1 ( 1  (8) \nwhere: \nω is the radian frequency of the applied signal. \nVREF, a dc voltage, is set so that V OUT is always a positive value, \neliminating the need for a negative supply.  \nAD2S1205  \n \nRev.

Buffer Circuit \n CLOCK REQUIREMENTS \nTo achieve the specified dynamic performance, an external crystal \nis recommended at the CLKIN and XTALOUT pins. The position \nand velocity accuracy are guaranteed for a frequency range of 8.192 MHz ± 25%. However, the velocity outputs are scaled in \nproportion to the clock frequency so that if the clock is 25% \ngreater than the nominal, the full-scale velocity is 25% greater than nominal. The maximum tracking rate, tracking loop bandwidth, \nand excitation frequency also vary with the clock frequency. \nABSOLUTE POSITION AND VELOCITY OUTPUT \nThe angular position and velocity are represented by binary data \nand can be extracted via either a 12-bit parallel interface or a  \n3-wire serial interface that operates at clock rates of up to 25 MHz.  \nSOE  Input \nThe serial output enable pin ( SOE ) is held high to enable the \nparallel interface and low to enable the serial interface. In the \nlatter case, Pin DB0 to Pin DB9 are placed into a high impedance \nstate while DB11 is the serial output (SO) and DB10 is the serial \nclock input (SCLK). \nData Format \nThe angular position data represents the absolute position of \nthe resolver shaft as a 12-bit unsigned binary word.

A | Page 14 of 20 SERIAL INTERFACE \nThe angular position and velocity are available on the AD2S1205 \nin two 12-bit registers. These registers can be accessed via a 3-wire \nserial interface (SO, RD, and SCLK) that operates at clock rates  \nof up to 25 MHz and is compatible with SPI and DSP interface standards. The serial interface is selected by holding the SOE\n pin \nlow. Data from the position and velocity integrators are first trans-ferred to the position and velocity registers using the SAMPLE\n pin. \nThe RDVEL  pin selects whether data is transferred from the \nposition or velocity register to the output register, and the CS pin \nmust be held low to transfer data from the selected register to the output register. Finally, the RD\n input is used to read the data that  \nis clocked out of the output register and is available on the serial \noutput pin (SO). When the serial interface is selected, DB11 is used as the serial output pin (SO), DB10 is used as the serial clock input (SCLK), and Pin DB0 to Pin DB9 are placed into the high imped-\nance state. The timing requirements for the read cycle are described \nin . Figure 8\nSO Output \nThe output shift register is 16 bits wide. Data is clocked out of \nthe device as a 16-bit word by the serial clock input (SCLK). The timing diagram for this operation is shown in Figure 8 .  \nThe 16-bit word consists of 12 bits of angular data (position or \nvelocity, depending on RDVEL\n input), one RDVEL  status bit, \nand three status bits (a parity bit, a degradation of signal bit, and  \na loss of tracking bit). Data is clocked out MSB first from the  SO pin, beginning with DB15. DB15 through DB4 correspond to the angular information. The angular position data format  is unsigned binary, with all 0s corresponding to 0° and all 1s cor-\nresponding to 360° − l LSB. The angular velocity data format  \nis twos complement, with the MSB representing the rotation \ndirection. DB3 is the RDVEL\n status bit, with a 1 indicating \nposition and a 0 indicating velocity. DB2 is DOS, the degradation \nof signal flag (refer to the  section). Bit 1 \nis LOT, the loss of tracking flag (refer to the \n section). Bit 0 is PAR, the parity bit. The position and \nvelocity data are in odd parity format, and the data readback \nalways contains an odd number of logic highs (1s).

On a falling edge of \nthe RD signal, data is transferred to the output buffer. Data is \nthen available on the serial output pin (SO); however, it is only valid after RD\n is held low for t 9. The serial data is clocked out  \nof the SO pin on the rising edges of SCLK, and each data bit is \navailable at the SO pin on the falling edge of SCLK. However,  \nas the MSB is clocked out by the falling edge of RD, the MSB is \navailable at the SO pin on the first falling edge of SCLK. Each \nsubsequent bit of the data-word is shifted out on the rising edge \nof SCLK and is available at the SO pin on the falling edge of \nSCLK for the next 15 clock pulses.  \nThe high-to-low transition of RD must occur during the high \ntime of the SCLK to avoid DB14 being shifted on the first rising \nedge of the SCLK, which would result in the MSB being lost. \nRD may rise high after the last falling edge of SCLK. If RD is \nheld low and additional SCLKs are applied after DB0 has been read, then 0s will be clocked from the data output.

Pulse A leads Pulse B for increasing angular rotation (clockwise direction). The addition of the DIR output negates the need for external A and B direction decode logic. The DIR \noutput indicates the direction of the input rotation and is high \nfor increasing angular rotation. DIR can be considered an asyn-chronous output that can make multiple changes in state between two consecutive LSB update cycles. This occurs when the direction of the rotation of the input changes but the magnitude of the rotation is less than 1 LSB. \nThe north marker pulse is generated as the absolute angular \nposition passes through zero. The north marker pulse width is \nset internally for 90° and is defined relative to the A cycle. Figure 9  details the relationship between A, B, and NM. \n \n06339-009A\nB\nNM \nFigure 9.

A 1024-line laser-\nbased encoder has a maximum speed of 7300 rpm. \nThe inclusion of A and B outputs allows an AD2S1205 and \nresolver-based solution to replace optical encoders directly \nwithout the need to change or upgrade the user’s existing \napplication software. \nSUPPLY SEQUENCING AND RESET \nThe AD2S1205 requires an external reset signal to hold the \nRESET  input low until V DD is within the specified operating \nrange of 4.5 V to 5.5 V . \nThe RESET  pin must be held low for a minimum of 10 μs after \nVDD is within the specified range (shown as t RST in ). \nApplying a Figure 10\nRESET  signal to the AD2S1205 initializes the output \nposition to a value of 0x000 (degrees output through the parallel, \nserial, and encoder interfaces) and causes LOS to be indicated \n(LOT and DOS pins pulled low), as shown in . Figure 10\nFailure to apply the correct power-up/reset sequence may result \nin an incorrect position indication.  \nAfter a rising edge on the RESET  input, the device must be \nallowed at least 20 ms (shown as t TRACK  in ) for the \ninternal circuitry to stabilize and the tracking loop to settle to \nthe step change of the input position. After t TRACK , a Figure 10\nSAMPLE  \npulse must be applied, which in turn releases the LOT and DOT \npins to the state determined by the fault detection circuitry and \nprovides valid position data at the parallel and serial outputs. (Note that if position data is acquired via the encoder outputs,  \nit can be monitored during t\nTRACK .) \nThe RESET  pin is then internally pulled up. \ntRSTtRST\n06339-010VDD\nRESET4.75V\nVALID\nOUTPUTDATASAMPLE\nLOT\nDOStTRACK\n \nFigure 10.

Figure 16  shows the AD2S1205 \ninterfaced to an ADMC401, one of the DSP-based motor \ncontrollers. \nThe on-chip serial port of the ADMC401 is used in the following \nconfiguration \n• Alternate framing transmit mode with internal framing \n(internally inverted) \n• Normal framing receive mode with external framing \n(internally inverted) \n• Internal serial clock generation \nIn this configuration, the internal TFS signal of ADMC401  \nis used as an external RFS to fully control the timing of  \ndata received, and the same TFS is connected to RD of the \nAD2S1205. In addition, the ADMC401 provides an internal continuous serial clock to the AD2S1205. The SAMPLE\n signal \non the AD2S1205 can be provided either by using a PIO or by \ninverting the PWMSYNC signal to synchronize the position \nand velocity readings with the PWM switching frequency. CS and RDVEL  can be obtained using two PIO outputs of the \nADMC401. The 12 bits of significant data and the status bits  \nare available on each consecutive negative edge of the clock \nafter the RD signal goes low. Data is clocked from the AD2S1205 \ninto the data receive register of the ADMC401. This is internally \nset to 16 bits (12 data bits, 4 status bits) because 16 bits are received overall. The serial port automatically generates an internal processor interrupt. This allows the ADMC401 to  read all 16 bits and then continue to process data. \nAll ADMC401 products can interface to the AD2S1205 by using \nsimilar interface circuitry. \n06339-016SCLK\nDR\nTFS\nRFS\nPWMSYNC\nPIO\nPIOSCLK SOE\nSO\nRD\nSAMPLE\nCSRDVELADMC401 AD2S1205\n \nFigure 16.
