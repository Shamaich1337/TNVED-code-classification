The devices require only four small 0.1µF external charge-pump capacitors. The MAX3222, MAX3232, and MAX3241 are guaranteed to \nrun at data rates of 120kbps while maintaining RS-232 \noutput levels. The MAX3237 is guaranteed to run at data rates of 250kbps in normal operating mode and 1Mbps in \nthe MegaBaud™ operating mode.\nThe MAX3222/MAX3232 have 2 receivers and 2 drivers. \nThe MAX3222 and MAX3232 are pin, package, and func-tionally compatible with the industry-standard MAX242 \nand MAX232, respectively.\nThe MAX3241 has 5 receivers and 3 drivers, while the \nMAX3237 has 3 receivers and 5 drivers. Receivers R1 (MAX3237/MAX3241) and R2 (MAX3241) have extra \noutputs in addition to their standard outputs. These extra \noutputs are always active, allowing external devices to be monitored without forward biasing the protection diodes in \ncircuitry that may have V\nCC completely removed.\nThe MAX3222, MAX3232, and MAX3241 are available in \nspace-saving TSSOP and SSOP packages with operating temperatures of either -40°C to +85°C or 0°C to 70°C.\nApplications\n ●Battery-Powered Equipment\n ●Hand-Held Equipment\n ●Peripherals\n ●Datacom EquipmentBenefits and Features\n ●Integrated Features Saves Board Space and  \nSimplifies Design\n• Charge Pump Circuitry Eliminates the Need for a \nBipolar ±12V Supply\n• Wide Single-Supply Operation From +3V to +5.5V Supply\n• Always-On Extra Outputs Enable Monitoring of External Devices\n ●Power Saving Extends Battery Life\n• 1µA Supply Current in Shutdown Mode While  \nReceiver is Active (MAX3222, MAX3237, MAX3241)\nOrdering Information continued at end of data sheet.\nTypical Operating Circuits appear at end of data sheet.Pin Configurations continued at end of data sheet.\nMegaBaud and UCSP are trademarks of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.\n*Covered by U.S. Patent numbers 4,636,930; 4,679,134; 4,777,577; 4,797,899; 4,809,152; 4,897,774; 4,999,761; and other patents \npending.\n19-0273; Rev 10; 5/19+Denotes lead-free package.PART TEMP RANGEPIN-\nPACKAGEPKG  \nCODE\nMAX3222CUP+ 0°C to +70°C 20 TSSOP U20+2\nMAX3222CAP+ 0°C to +70°C 20 SSOP A20+1\nMAX3222CWN+ 0°C to +70°C 18 SO W18+1\nMAX3222CPN+ 0°C to +70°C 18 Plastic Dip P18+5Ordering Information\nPin Configurations\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13\n12\n1112\n3\n4\n5\n67\n8SHDN\nV\nCC\nGND\nT1OUT C1-V+C1+ENTOP VIEW\nR1IN\nR1OUT\nT1IN\nT2IN T2OUTV-C2-C2+\n10 9 R2OUT R2IN\nDIP/SOMAX3222Click here for production status of specific part numbers.\nMAX3222/MAX3232/  \nMAX3237/MAX3241*3.0V to 5.5V, Low-Power, Up to 1Mbps, \nTrue RS-232 Transceivers \nVCC .......................................................................... -0.3V to +6V\nV+ (Note 1) .............................................................. -0.3V to +7V\nV- (Note 1) ............................................................... +0.3V to -7V\nV+ + V- (Note 1) .................................................................. +13V\nInput Voltages\n T_IN, SHDN, EN.................................................. -0.3V to +6V\n MBAUD ................................................. -0.3V to (V CC + 0.3V)\n R_IN ................................................................................. ±25V\nOutput Voltages T_OUT  .......................................................................... ±13.2V\n R_OUT  .................................................. -0.3V to (V\nCC + 0.3V)\nShort-Circuit Duration\n T_OUT  ...................................................................

The \ncharge pumps operate in a discontinuous mode; if the \noutput voltages are less than 5.5V, the charge pumps \nare enabled, and if the output voltages exceed 5.5V, the charge pumps are disabled. Each charge pump requires \na flying capacitor (C1, C2) and a reservoir capacitor (C3, \nC4) to generate the V+ and V- supplies.\nRS-232 Transmitters\nThe transmitters are inverting level translators that  \nconvert CMOS-logic levels to 5.0V EIA/TIA-232 levels.\nThe MAX3222/MAX3232/MAX3241 transmitters guar-\nantee a 120kbps data rate with worst-case loads of \n3kΩ in parallel with 1000pF, providing compatibility with PC-to-PC communication software (such as LapLink™). \nTypically, these three devices can operate at data rates of \n235kbps. Transmitters can be paralleled to drive multiple receivers or mice.The MAX3222/MAX3237/MAX3241’s output stage is turned off (high impedance) when the device is in shut-\ndown mode. When the power is off, the MAX3222/\nMAX3232/MAX3237/MAX3241 permit the outputs to be driven up to ±12V.\nThe transmitter inputs do not have pullup resistors. \nConnect unused inputs to GND or V\nCC.\nMAX3237 MegaBaud Operation\nIn normal operating mode (MBAUD = GND), the MAX3237 \ntransmitters guarantee a 250kbps data rate with worst-\ncase loads of 3kΩ in parallel with 1000pF. This provides \ncompatibility with PC-to-PC communication software, such as LapLink.\nFor higher speed serial communications, the MAX3237 \nfeatures MegaBaud operation. In MegaBaud operating mode (MBAUD = V\nCC), the MAX3237 transmitters guar-\nantee a 1Mbps data rate with worst-case loads of 3kΩ in \nparallel with 250pF for 3.0V < V CC < 4.5V. For 5V ±10% \noperation, the MAX3237 transmitters guarantee a 1Mbps data rate into worst-case loads of 3kΩ in parallel with \n1000pF.\nLapLink is a trademark of Traveling Software, Inc.\nFigure 1.

The MAX3222/MAX3237/MAX3241 receiv-\ners have inverting three-state outputs. In shutdown, the \nreceivers can be active or inactive (Table 1).\nThe complementary outputs on the MAX3237 (R1OUTB) \nand the MAX3241 (R1OUTB, R2OUTB) are always \nactive, regardless of the state of EN or SHDN. This allows \nfor Ring Indicator applications without forward biasing \nother devices connected to the receiver outputs. This is \nideal for systems where V CC is set to 0V in shutdown to \naccommodate peripherals, such as UARTs (Figure 2).\nMAX3222/MAX3237/MAX3241  \nShutdown Mode\nSupply current falls to less than 1μA in shutdown mode (SHDN = low). When shut down, the device’s charge \npumps are turned off, V+ is pulled down to V\nCC, V- is \npulled to ground, and the transmitter outputs are disabled (high impedance). The time required to exit shutdown is \ntypically 100μs, as shown in Figure 3. Connect SHDN \nto V\nCC if the shutdown mode is not used. SHDN has no \neffect on R_OUT or R_OUTB.\nMAX3222/MAX3237/MAX3241  \nEnable Control\nThe inverting receiver outputs (R_OUT) are put into a high-impedance state when EN is high. The complemen -\ntary outputs R1OUTB and R2OUTB are always active, regardless of the state of EN and SHDN (Table 1). EN has \nno effect on T_OUT.\nApplications Information\nCapacitor Selection\nThe capacitor type used for C1–C4 is not critical for proper operation; polarized or nonpolarized capacitors \ncan be used. The charge pump requires 0.1μF capaci -\ntors for 3.3V operation. For other supply voltages, refer to \nTable 2 for required capacitor values. Do not use values \nlower than those listed in Table 2. Increasing the capacitor \nvalues (e.g., by a factor of 2) reduces ripple on the trans-\nmitter outputs and slightly reduces power consumption. \nC2, C3, and C4 can be increased without changing C1’s value. However, do not increase C1 without also increas -\ning the values of C2, C3, and C4, to maintain the proper \nratios (C1 to the other capacitors).\nWhen using the minimum required capacitor values, \nmake sure the capacitor value does not degrade exces-sively with temperature. If in doubt, use capacitors with a \nhigher nominal value. The capacitor’s equivalent series \nresistance (ESR), which usually rises at low tempera-tures, influences the amount of ripple on V+ and V-.Figure 2.

In applications that are sensitive to power-\nsupply noise, decouple V CC to ground with a capacitor of \nthe same value as charge-pump capacitor C1. Connect \nbypass capacitors as close to the IC as possible.\nOperation Down to 2.7V\nTransmitter outputs will meet EIA/TIA-562 levels of ±3.7V with supply voltages as low as 2.7V.\nTransmitter Outputs when  \nExiting Shutdown\nFigure 3 shows two transmitter outputs when exiting shut-down mode. As they become active, the two transmitter \noutputs are shown going to opposite RS-232 levels (one \ntransmitter input is high, the other is low). Each transmit-ter is loaded with 3kΩ in parallel with 2500pF. The trans-\nmitter outputs display no ringing or undesirable transients \nas they come out of shutdown. Note that the transmitters \nare enabled only when the magnitude of V- exceeds \napproximately 3V.\nMouse Driveability\nThe MAX3241 has been specifically designed to power serial mice while operating from low-voltage power sup-\nplies. It has been tested with leading mouse brands \nfrom manufacturers such as Microsoft and Logitech. The MAX3241 successfully drove all serial mice tested and \nmet their respective current and voltage requirements. \nFigure 4a shows the transmitter output voltages under \nincreasing load current at 3.0V.
