The A port is designed to track\nVCCA while the B port is designed to track V CCB. Both\nVCCA and V CCB are configurable from 0.9 V to 3.6 V.\nThe SN74AVC4T234 solution offers the industry\'s\nlow-power needs in battery-powered portable\napplications by ensuring both a very low static and\ndynamic power consumption across the entire V CC\nrange of 0.9 V to 3.6 V, resulting in an increased\nbattery life. This product also maintains excellent\nsignal integrity.\nThis device is fully specified for partial-power-down\napplications using I off. The I off circuitry disables the\noutputs, preventing damaging current backflow\nthrough the device when it is powered down.\nThe V CC isolation feature ensures that if either V CC\ninput is at GND, then A-side ports are in the high-\nimpedance state.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nSN74AVC4T234ZSU uCSP (11) 2.00 mm × 1.40 mm\nSN74AVC4T234ZWA NFBGA (11) 2.00 mm × 1.40 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the data sheet.\nB1\nB2\nB3\nB4 A4A3A2A1VCCA VCCB\nLogic Diagram (Positive Logic)www.ti.comSN74AVC4T234\nSCES810B – JUNE 2011 – REVISED JULY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: SN74AVC4T234SN74AVC4T234\nSCES810B – JUNE 2011 – REVISED JULY 2020\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Translation Up (1.2 V to 3.3 V) at 2.5 MHz\n10 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe SN74AVC4T234 device uses two separate configurable power-supply rails, V CCA and V CCB. VCCA accepts\nany supply voltage from 0.9 V to 3.6 V and V CCB accepts any supply voltage from 0.9 V to 3.6 V. The A port and\nB port are designed to track V CCA and V CCB respectively allowing for low-voltage bidirectional translation\nbetween any of the 0.9-V, 1.05-V, 1.2-V, 1.5-V, 1.8-V, 2.5-V and 3.3-V voltage nodes.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nTo ensure reliability of the device, following common printed-circuit board layout guidelines is recommended.\n• Bypass capacitors should be used on power supplies.\n• Short trace lengths should be used to avoid excessive loading.\n• Place pads on the signal paths for loading capacitors or pullup resistors to help adjust rise and fall times of\nsignals, depending on the system requirements.\n11.2 Layout Example\nCopper Traces Via to V CCBVia to V CCA Via to GND A\nBGLegend\nA2A1\nVCCB\nGNDA3\nA4 B4B3B2B1\nVCCA0.1µF\nB\nGG\nfrom SoC from SoC\nto module\nto modulefrom SoC\nfrom SoC\nfrom SoCA\nGCopper Traces Via to V CCBVia to V CCA Via to GND A\nBGLegend\nA2A1\nVCCB\nGNDA3\nA4 B4B3B2B1\nVCCA0.1µF\nB\nGG\nto module\nfrom SoC\nfrom SoC\nfrom SoCto module\nto module\nto moduleA\nG 0.1µFSN74AVC4T234\nSCES810B – JUNE 2011 – REVISED JULY 2020 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74AVC4T234\n12 Device and Documentation Support\n12.1 Support Resources\nTI E2E™ support forums  are an engineer\'s go-to source for fast, verified answers and design help — straight\nfrom the experts.

#### Description:
The SN74AVC4T234 is a 4-bit dual-supply unidirectional non-inverting voltage translator. It facilitates asynchronous communication between two different voltage domains (A and B ports) by allowing signals to be translated from one voltage level to another. The device is designed to operate with two separate configurable power-supply rails, enabling it to handle a wide range of input and output voltages from 0.9 V to 3.6 V.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Personal Electronics:** Used in devices that require level shifting between different voltage domains, such as smartphones and tablets.
- **Industrial Applications:** Suitable for interfacing sensors and controllers operating at different voltage levels.
- **Enterprise Systems:** Can be utilized in data communication systems where devices operate at varying voltage levels.
- **Telecommunications:** Ideal for signal translation in communication equipment that requires compatibility between different voltage standards.

This component is particularly beneficial in battery-powered portable applications due to its low power consumption, which helps extend battery life while maintaining signal integrity across various voltage levels.
