This IC is suitable for \nmicroprocessors or industrial  system applicat ions providing \nboth reset and manual reset functions.\nVDD Lock Out\nApplying power to the ISL88041 V DD activates a lock out circuit \nwhich disables the rep orting function until V DD rises to ~2.6V. \nAs V DD bias is applied the RST  output is held low before \nVDD = 1V. If V DD falls below ~2.4V the lock out of monitoring \nand reporting functions is invoked.\nLow Voltage Monitoring\nOnce biased to 2.7V the IC continuously monitors and reports from one to four v oltages independently through \nexternal resistor dividers comparing each VMON pin voltage to a nominal internal 0.635V reference. Once all VMON input voltages rise above thi s threshold, the RST\n output is \nimmediately deasserted by bei ng released to be pulled high \nvia its internal 20k \uf057\uf020(or optional external) pull resistor to V DD \nindicating that all the minimum voltage conditions have been met (see Figure 4). The RST\n output is open-d rain to allow \nORing of signals and interfacin g to a range of logic levels. \nOnce any VMON input falls bel ow its respective user-set \nthreshold, the RST  output is pulled low af ter the glitch filter \ndelay (t FIL) as the VMON inputs are designed to reject short \nundervoltage transients of approximately 30µs (see \nFigure 5). The user can customize the individual rail undervoltage threshold (V TRIP) by connecting individual \nVMON pins to an external resis tor divider acco rding to the \nEquation 1:\nSee Figure 8 for a typical application configuration.\nManual Reset\nThe manual-reset input (MR ) allows the user to trigger a reset \nby using a push-button switch o r by signaling the input low. \nReset is asserted and deasse rted immediately upon MR  \ntransitioning through MR VTH, see Figures 6 and 7.\nFigure 1 is the operational timing diagram. \nUsing the ISL88041EVAL1\nThe ISL88041EVAL1 is the eva luation platform for this \nproduct and illustrates the fl exibility and simplicity of \nmonitoring four separat e voltages. The RST  output can be \nmonitored once the V DD, GND, and appropriate 3.3V, 2.5V, \n1.8V and 1.2V supply voltage inputs are properly biased as \nlabeled. A Manual Reset (MR ) input is also available for \nevaluation. The circuit as shown in Figures 10 and 11 has resistor dividers chosen to monitor fo r an undervoltage threshold \nlevel of 89% of the 4 nominal v oltages. Figure 1 illustrates \nthe expected behavior and Figures 4 through 7 illustrate the \nactual IC performance in the ISL88041EVAL1. VTRIP0.635V R1 R2 +\uf028\uf029 R2\uf0a4 = (EQ. 1)\nFIGURE 1.
