Using ADI’s patented temperature drift curvature correction and XFET (eXtra implanted junction FET) technology, the ADR44x family’s voltage change vs. temperature \nnonlinearity is greatly minimized. \nThe XFET references offer better noise performance than \nburied-Zener references, and XFET references operate off \nlow supply headroom (0.5 V). This combination of features makes the ADR44x family ideally suited for precision signal \nconversion applications in high-end data acquisition systems, \noptical networks, and medical requirements. \nThe ADR44x family has the capability to source up to 10 mA \nand sink up to 5 mA of output current. It also comes with a \nTRIM terminal to adjust the output voltage over a 0.5% range \nwithout compromising any performance. Offered in two electrical grades, the ADR44x family is avail-\nable in the 8-lead SOIC and MSOP packages. All versions are specified over the extended industrial temperature range \n(−40\noC to +125oC). \nTable 1.

Ripple Rejection vs. Frequency \n \nADR440/ADR441/ADR443/ADR444/ADR445 \n \nRev. 0 | Page 14 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADR44x series of references uses a new reference generation \ntechnique known as XFET (eXtra implanted junction FET). \nThis technique yields a reference with low dropout, good thermal hysteresis, and exceptionally low noise. The core of the XFET reference consists of two junction field-effect transistors (JFETs), one of which has an extra channel implant to raise its \npinch-off voltage. By running the two JFETs at the same drain \ncurrent, the difference in pinch-off voltage can be amplified \nand used to form a highly stable voltage reference. \nThe intrinsic reference voltage is around 0.5 V with a negative \ntemperature coefficient of about –120 ppm/°C. This slope is \nessentially constant to the dielectric constant of silicon and can be closely compensated for by adding a correction term generated in the same fashion as the proportional-to-temperature (PTAT) term used to compensate band gap references. The advantage \nof an XFET reference is the correction term is approximately \n20 times lower and requires less correction than a band gap \nreference. This results in much lower noise, because most of \nthe noise of a band gap reference results from the temperature \ncompensation circuitry.  \nFigure 31  shows the basic topology of the ADR44x series. The \ntemperature correction term is provided by a current source \nwith a value designed to be proportional to absolute temperature. \nThe general equation is \n( )PTAT P OUT I R1 V G V× − × = Δ  (1) \nwhere: \nG is the gain of the reciprocal of the divider ratio.  \nΔVP is the difference in pinch-off voltage between the two JFETs. \nIPTAT is the positive temperature coefficient correction current.  \nADR44x devices are created by on-chip adjustment of R2 and \nR3 to achieve the different voltage option at the reference \noutput. \nIPTATI1\n1I1\n1EXTRA CHANNEL IMPLANT\nVOUT = G(Δ VP–R1×IPTAT )R2VIN\nVOUT\nGNDR3 R1ΔVP\n05428-033ADR44x\n \nFigure 31. Simplified Schematic Device \n POWER DISSIPATION CONSIDERATIONS \nThe ADR44x family of references is guaranteed to deliver load \ncurrents to 10 mA with an input voltage that ranges from 2.6 V \nto 18 V . When these devices are used in applications at higher currents, users should use the following equation to account for the temperature effects due to the power dissipation increases. \nA JA D J T P T+θ×=  (2) \nwhere: \nTJ and TA are the junction and ambient temperatures. \nPD is the device power dissipation. \nθJA is the device package thermal resistance. \nBASIC VOLTAGE REFERENCE CONNECTIONS \nThe ADR44x family requires a 0.1 μF capacitor on the input  \nand output for stability. While not required for operation, \na 10 μF capacitor at the input can help with line voltage transient performance. \n+\nNOTES\n1. NIC = NO INTERNAL CONNECTION2.

Basic Voltage Reference Configuration \nNOISE PERFORMANCE \nThe noise generated by the ADR44x family of references is \ntypically less than 1.4 μV p-p over the 0.1 Hz to 10.0 Hz band \nfor ADR440, ADR441, and ADR443. Figure 24  shows the 0.1 Hz \nto 10 Hz noise of the ADR441, which is only 1.2 μV p-p. The noise measurement is made with a band-pass filter made of a 2-pole high-pass filter with a corner frequency at 0.1 Hz and a 2-\npole low-pass filter with a corner frequency at 10.0 Hz. \nTURN-ON TIME \nUpon application of power (cold start), the time required for \nthe output voltage to reach its final value within a specified \nerror band is defined as the turn-on settling time. Two compo-\nnents normally associated with this are the time for the active \ncircuits to settle, and the time for the thermal gradients on the chip to stabilize. \nFigure 18  and Figure 19  show the turn-on and \nturn-off settling times for the ADR441. \n ADR440/ADR441/ADR443/ADR444/ADR445\n \nRev. 0 | Page 15 of 20 APPLICATIONS \nOUTPUT ADJUSTMENT \nThe ADR44x family features a TRIM pin that allows the user to \nadjust the output voltage of the part over a limited range. This \nallows both errors from the reference and overall system errors to be trimmed out by connecting a potentiometer between the \noutput and ground, with the wiper connected to the TRIM pin. \nFigure 33  shows the optimal trim configuration. R1 allows fine \nadjustment of the output and is not always required. R P should \nbe sufficiently large so that the maximum output current from \nthe ADR44x is not exceeded. \nTRIMVIN\nVO =±0.5%0.1μF\n0.1μF\nGND\nR2RPADR44x\n05428-035VOUT 62\n5\n4R1\n \nFigure 33. ADR44x Trim Function \nUsing the trim function had a negligible effect on the \ntemperature performance of the ADR44x family. However, all \nresistors used need to be low temperature coefficient resistors, \nor errors can occur. \nBIPOLAR OUTPUTS \nBy connecting the output of the ADR44x to the inverting \nterminal of an op amp, it is possible to obtain both positive \nand negative reference voltages. Care must be taken when choosing Resistor R1 and Resistor R2 (see \nFigure 34 ). They \nmust be matched as closely as possible to ensure minimal differences between the negative and positive outputs. In addition, care must be taken to ensure performance over temperature. Use low temperature coefficient resistors if the circuit is to be used over temperature; otherwise, differences will exist between the two outputs. 62\n4VIN\nVOUT\nGNDR1\n10kΩR2\n10kΩ\nR3\n5kΩ\n–10V+10V\n–5V+5V0.1μF\n0.1μFADR445\n05428-036+VDD\n \nFigure 34.

Second, and more importantly, it does not require any external resistors. This means the performance of this circuit does not rely on choosing low TC resistors to \nensure accuracy. \n+VDD\n–VREFGNDVIN\nVOUT\nADR44x\n–VDD\n05428-0372\n6\n4\n \nFigure 35.

The potentiometer \nconnected between V OUT and ground, with its wiper connected \nto the noninverting input of the op amp, takes care of coarse \ntrim. The second potentiometer, with its wiper connected to the trim terminal of the ADR44x, is used for fine adjustment. Resolution depends on the end-to-end resistance value and the \nresolution of the selected potentiometer. \n62\n4VIN\nVOUT\nGNDR2\n10kΩADJ VREF\nADR445\n05428-038+VDD\nR1\n10kΩ\n \nFigure 36.

PROGRAMMABLE CURRENT SOURCE \nIt is possible to build a programmable current source using a \nsimilar setup as the programmable voltage source, as shown in \nFigure 37 . The constant voltage on the gate of the transistor sets \nthe current through the load. Varying the voltage on the gate changes the current.
