**Description:**
The LFCN-1700+ is a ceramic low pass filter designed to allow signals below a certain frequency to pass while attenuating signals above that frequency. It operates effectively from DC to 1700 MHz, making it suitable for various RF applications. The filter is constructed using LTCC technology, which enhances its performance and reliability.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Harmonic Rejection:** Used in systems where it is essential to suppress unwanted harmonic frequencies.
- **VHF/UHF Transmitters/Receivers:** Ideal for communication systems operating in the VHF and UHF bands.
- **Laboratory Use:** Commonly utilized in test and measurement setups where signal integrity is crucial.
- **DC Isolation:** In applications requiring DC isolation to ground, coupling capacitors are recommended to avoid DC leakage.

This low pass filter is particularly useful in RF applications where maintaining signal quality while minimizing interference from higher frequency signals is critical.
