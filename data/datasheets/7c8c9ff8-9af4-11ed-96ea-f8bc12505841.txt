This is the ground return path for the charge pump.  \n2 AV DD  Analog Power Supply. This ranges from 3.0 V to 3.6 V. Decoupling capacitors to the analog ground plane should be \nplaced as close as possible to this pin. AV DD must have the same value as DV DD.  \n3, 8, 11, 22  AGND  Analog Ground. This is the ground return path of the prescaler and VCO.  \n4 RF OUTA  VCO Output. The output level is programmable from −5 dBm to −14 dBm. See the Output Matching  section for a d e-\nscription of the various output stages.  \n5 RF OUTB  VCO Complementary Output. The output level is programmable from −5 dBm to −14 dBm. See the Output Matching  \nsection for a description of the various output stages.  \n6 VVCO  Power Supply for the VCO. This ranges from 3.0 V to 3.6 V. Decoupling capacitors to the analog ground plane should \nbe placed as close as possible to this pin. V VCO must hav e the same value as AV DD.  \n7 VTUNE  Control Input to the VCO. This voltage determines the output frequency and is derived from filtering the CP output voltage.  \n9 L1 An external inductor to AGND should be connected to this pin to set the ADF4360- 7 output frequency. L1 and L2 need \nto be the same value. For inductances greater than 3.3 nH, a 470 Ω  resistor should be added in parallel to AGND.  \n10 L2 An external inductor to AGND should be connected to this pin to set th e ADF4360- 7 outpu t frequency. L1 and L2 need \nto be the same value. For inductances greater than 3.3 nH, a 470 Ω resistor should be added in parallel to AGND.  \n12 CC Internal Compensation Node. This pin must be decoupled to ground with a 10 nF capacitor.  \n13 RSET  Connecting a resistor between this pin and CPGND sets the maximum charge pump output current for the synthesi zer. The \nnominal voltage potential at the R SET pin is 0.6 V. The relationship betw een I CP and RSET is \nSETCPmaxRI11.75=\n \nwhere RSET = 4.7 kΩ, and ICPmax  = 2.5 mA.  \n14 CN Internal Compensation Node. This pin must be decoupled to V VCO with a 10 µF capacitor.  \n15 DGND  Digital Ground.  \n16 REF IN  Reference Input. This is a CMOS input with a nominal threshold of V DD/2 and a dc equivalent  input resistance of 100 kΩ \n(see Figure 16). This input can be driven from a TTL or CMOS crystal oscillator, or it can be ac -coupled.  \n17 CLK  Serial Clock Input. This serial clock is used to clock in the serial da ta to the registers. The data is latched into the 24 -bit \nshift register on the CLK rising edge. This input is a high impedance CMOS input.  \n18 DATA  Serial Data Input. The serial data is loaded MSB first with the two LSBs being the control bits. This inpu t is a high i m-\npedance CMOS input.  \n19 LE  Load Enable, CMOS Input. When LE goes high, the data stored in the shift registers is loaded into one of the four latc hes, and \nthe relevant latch is selected using the control bits.  \n20 MUXOUT  This multiplexer ou tput lets either the lock detect, the scaled RF, or the scaled reference frequ ency be accessed externally.  \n21 DV DD  Digital Power Supply. This ranges from 3.0 V to 3.6 V. Decoupling capacitors to the digital ground plane should be \nplaced as close as possi ble to this pin. DV DD must have the same value as AV DD.  \n23 CE  Chip Enable. A logic low on this pin powers down the device and puts the charge pump into three -state mode. Taking \nthe pin high powers up the device depending on the status of the power -down bits.  \n24 CP  Charge Pump Output. When enabled, this provides ± I CP to the external loop filter, which in turn drives the internal VCO.  \n0 EP Exposed Pad.

When \npower-down is initiated, SW3 is closed, and SW1 and SW2 are opened. This ensures that there is no loading of the REF\nIN pin \non power-down. \n04441-016BUFFERTO R COUNTER REFIN100k\uf057 NC\nSW2\nSW3\nNONC\nSW1POWER-DOWN\nCONTROL\n \nFigure 16. Reference Input Stage \nPRESCALER (P/P + 1) \nThe dual-modulus prescaler (P/P + 1), along with the A and B \ncounters, enables the large division ratio, N, to be realized  \n(N = BP + A). The dual-modulus prescaler, operating at CML \nlevels, takes the clock from the VCO and divides it down to a \nmanageable frequency for the CMOS A and B counters. The prescaler is programmable. It can be set in software to 8/9, 16/17, or 32/33 and is based on a synchronous 4/5 core. There is a minimum divide ratio possible for fully contiguous output \nfrequencies; this minimum is determined by P , the prescaler \nvalue, and is given by (P\n2 − P). \nA AND B COUNTERS \nThe A and B CMOS counters combine with the dual-modulus \nprescaler to allow a wide range division ratio in the PLL feed-\nback counter. The counters are specified to work when the  prescaler output is 300 MHz or less. Thus, with a VCO  frequency of 2.5 GHz, a prescaler value of 16/17 is valid, but a value of 8/9 is not valid. At fundamental VCO frequencies less than 700 MHz, a value of 8/9 is best. \nPulse Swallow Function \nThe A and B counters, in conjunction with the dual-modulus \nprescaler, make it possible to generate output frequencies that \nare spaced only by the reference frequency divided by R. The VCO frequency equation is \n\uf028\uf029\uf028\uf029 R fABP fREFIN VCO /\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d  \nwhere: \nfVCO is the output frequency of the VCO.  \nP is the preset modulus of the dual-modulus prescaler  \n(8/9 or 16/17). \nB is the preset divide ratio of the binary 13-bit counter (3 to 8191).  \nA is the preset divide ratio of the binary 5-bit swallow counter \n(0 to 31).  f\nREFIN is the external reference frequency oscillator.

Division ratios from 1 to 16,383 are \nallowed. \nPFD AND CHARGE PUMP \nThe PFD takes inputs from the R counter and N counter  \n(N = BP + A) and produces an output proportional to the phase \nand frequency difference between them. Figure 18 is a simpli-\nfied schematic. The PFD includes a programmable delay ele-ment that controls the width of the antibacklash pulse. This pulse ensures that there is no dead zone in the PFD transfer function and minimizes phase noise and reference spurs. Two bits in the R counter latch, ABP2 and ABP1, control the width of the pulse (see Table 9). \n04441-018PROGRAMMABLE\nDELAYU3\nCLR2\nQ2 D2\nU2CLR1Q1 D1CHARGE\nPUMP\nDOWNUPHI\nHIU1\nABP1 ABP2\nR DIVIDER\nN DIVIDER\nCP OUTPU TR DIVIDER\nN DIVIDERCP\nCPGNDVP\n \nFigure 18.

The state of \nMUXOUT is controlled by M3, M2, and M1 in the function \nlatch. The full truth table is shown in Table 7. Figure 19 shows \nthe MUXOUT section in block dia gram form.  \nLock Detect  \nMUXOUT can be programmed for two types of lock detect: \ndigital and analog. Digital lock detect is active high. When LDP \nin the R counter latch is set to 0, digital lock detect is set high when the phase err or on three consecutive phase detector c ycles \nis less than 15 ns.  \nWith LDP set to 1, five consecutive cycles of less than 15 ns \nphase error are required to set the lock detect. It stays set high \nuntil a phase error of greater than 25 ns is detected on any   \nsubsequent PD cycle.  \nThe N -channel open- drain analog lock detect should be  \noperated with an external pull -up resistor of 10 kΩ  nominal. \nWhen a lock has been detected, this output is high with narrow \nlow-going pulses. \nR COUNTER OUTPUT\nN COUNTER OUTPUTDIGITAL LOCK DETECT\nDGNDCONTROL MUX MUXOUTDVDD\nANALOG LOCK DETECT\nSDOUT\n04441-019\n \nFigure 19. MUXOUT Circuit  \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER  \nThe digital section of the ADF4360- 7 includes a 24- bit input \nshift register, a 14 -bit R counter, and an 18 -bit N counter  \ncomprised of a 5 -bit A count er and a 13 -bit B counter. Data is \nclocked into the 24 -bit shift register on each rising edge of CLK. \nThe data is clocked in MSB first. Data is transferred from the \nshift register to one of four latches on the rising edge of LE. The \ndestination latch is de termined by the state of the two co ntrol \nbits (C2, C1) in the shift register. These are the two LSBs, DB1 and DB0, shown in Figure 2. \nThe truth table for these bits is shown in Table 5. Table 6 shows \na summary of how the latches are programmed. Note that the test mode latch is used for factory testing and should not be programmed by the user.  \n \n Table 5.

It is im-\nportant that the correct write sequence be followed at po wer-up. \nThis sequence is :  \n1. R counter latch  \n2. Control latch  \n3.

Frequency vs. V TUNE , ADF4360 -7 \nThe R counter output is used as the clock for the ba nd select  \nlogic and should not exceed 1 MHz. A programmable divider is \nprovided at the R counter input to allow division by 1, 2, 4, or 8 and \nis controlled by Bits BSC1 and BSC2 in the R counter latch. Where \nthe required PFD frequency exceeds 1 MHz, the d ivide ratio should \nbe set to allow enough time for correct band sele ction.  \n \n  \nADF4360- 7 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. F | Page 12 of 25 After band selection, normal PLL action resumes. The value of \nKV is determined by the val ue of inductors use d (see the Choosing \nthe Correct Inductance  section). If divide -by-2 operation has \nbeen selected (by progra mming DIV2 [DB22 ] high in the N \ncounter latch), the value is halved. The ADF4360- 7 contains \nlinearization cir cuitry to minimize  any variation of the product \nof I CP and K V. \nThe operating current in the VCO core is programmable in four \nsteps: 5 mA, 10 mA, 15 mA, and 20 mA. This is controlled by Bits PC1 and PC2 in the control latch.  \nOUTPUT STAGE  \nThe RF OUTA and RF OUTB pins of the ADF4360- 7 are co nnected \nto the collectors of an NPN differential pair driven by buffered \noutputs of the VCO, as shown in Figure 21. To allow the user to \noptimize the power dissipation vs. the output power require-\nments, the tail current of the differential pair is pr ogrammable \nvia Bits PL1 and PL2 in the control latch. Four cu rrent levels \nmay be set: 3.5 mA, 5 mA, 7.5 mA, and 11 mA. Th ese levels give \noutput power  levels of −14 dBm, −11 dBm, −8 dBm, and −5 dBm, \nrespectively, using a 50 Ω resistor to V DD and ac coupling into a \n50 Ω load. Alternatively, both ou tputs can be combined in a  \n1 + 1:1 transformer or a 180° microstrip co upler (see the  \nOutput Matching  section).  If the outputs are used individually, the optimum output stage \nconsists of a shunt inductor to V DD.  \nAnother feature of the ADF4360- 7 is that the supply cu rrent  \nto the RF output stage is shut down until the device  achieves lock as \nmeasured by the digital lock detect circuitry. This is e nabled by the \nmute -till-lock detec t (MTLD) bit in the control latch.  \nVCORFOUTA RFOUTB\nBUFFER/\nDIVIDEBY2\n04441-021 \nFigure 21.

F | Page 17 of 25 POWER -UP \nPower -Up Se quence  \nThe correct programming sequence for the ADF4360- 7 after \npower -up is: \n1. R counter latch  \n2. Control latch  \n3. N counter latch  \nInitial P ower -Up \nInitial power -up refers to programming the device  after the  \napplication of voltage to the AV DD, DV DD, V VCO and CE pins. On \ninitial power -up, an interval is required between programming \nthe c ontrol latch and programming the N counter latch. This \ninterval is necessary to allow the transient behavior of th e \nADF4360- 7 during initial power -up to settle.  \n \n During initial power -up, a write to the c ontrol latch powers up \nthe device , and the bias cu rrents of the VCO begin to settle. If \nthese cu rrents have not settled to within 10% of their steady -\nstate value , and if the N counter latch is then programmed, the \nVCO may not oscillate at the desired frequency, which does  not \nallow the band select logic to choose the correct frequency \nband , and the ADF4360- 7 may not achieve lock. If the reco m-\nmended interval is inserted, and the N counter latch is pr o-\ngrammed, the band select logic can choose the correct frequen-cy band , and the device  locks to the correct fr equency.  \nThe duration of this interval is affected by the value of the ca-\npacitor on the C\nN pin ( Pin 14). This capacitor is used to reduce \nthe close -in noise of the ADF4360 -7 VCO. The recommended \nvalue of this capacitor is 10 µ F. Using this value requires an in-\nterval of ≥ 10 ms between the latching in of the c ontrol latch bits \nand latching in of the N counter latch bits. If a shorter delay is required , the capacitor can be reduced. A slight phase noise \npenalty is incurred by this change , which is further explained in \nthe Table 10. \nTable 10.

F | Page 18 of 25 Hardware Power -Up/Power -Down  \nIf the device  is powered down via  the hardware (using the \nCE pin) and powered up again without any change to the \nN counter register during power -down, the device  locks at the \ncorrect fr equency , because  the device  is already in the correct \nfrequency band. The lock time depend s on the value of capaci-\ntance on the C N pin, which is  <10 ms for 10 µ F capacitance. The \nsmaller c apacitance of 440 nF on this pin enable s lock times of \n<600 µs. \nThe N counter value cannot be changed wh ile the device is in \npower -down, since  the device  may not lock to the  correct  \nfrequency on power -up. If it is updated, the correct progra m-\nming sequence for the device  after power -up is  the R counter \nlatch, followed by the control latch, and finally the N counter \nlatch, with the r equired interval between the c ontrol latch a nd \nN counter latch , as described in the Initial P ower -Up section.  Software Power -Up/Power -Down  \nIf the device  is powered down via the  software (using the c on-\ntrol latch) and powered up again without any change to the N \ncounter latc h during power -down, the device  locks at the cor-\nrect fre quency , because  the device  is already in the correct fr e-\nquency band. The lock time depend s on the value of capac i-\ntance on the C N pin, which is  <10 ms for 10 µ F capacitance. The \nsmaller c apacitance of 440 nF on this pin enable s lock times of \n<600 µs. \nThe N counter value cannot be changed while the device  is in \npower -down, because  the device  may not lock to the correct  \nfrequency on power -up. If it is updated, the correct progra m-\nming sequence for the dev ice after power -up is to the R counter \nlatch, followed by the control latch, and finally the N counter latch, with the required interval between the c ontrol latch and \nN counter latch , as described in the Initial P ower -Up section . \nData Sheet  ADF4360- 7 \n \nRev.

In the pr o-\ngrammed synchronous power -down, the device power -down is \ngated by the charge pump to prevent unwanted frequency jumps. Once the power -down is enabled by writing a 1 into  \nBit PD1 (on the condition that a 1 has also been loaded to PD2), the device goes into power -down on the second rising edge of \nthe R counter output, after LE goes high. When the CE pin is low, the device is immediately disabled r egardless of the state of \nPD1 or PD2.  \nWhen a powe r-down is activated (either synchronous or  \nasynchronous mode), the following events occur:  \n• All active dc current paths are removed.  \n• The R, N, and timeout counters are forced to their load  \nstate conditions.  \n• The charge pump is forced into three -state mod e.  \n• The digital lock detect circuitry is reset.  \n• The RF outputs are debiased to a high im pedance state.  \n• The reference input buffer circuitry is di sabled.  \n• The input register remains active and capable of loa ding \nand latching data.  Charge Pump Currents  \nCPI3, CPI2, and CPI1 in the ADF4360- 7 determine  \nCurrent Setting 1.  \nCPI6, CPI5, and CPI4 determine Current Setting 2. See the truth table in Table 7. \nOutput Power L evel  \nBits PL1 and PL2 set the output power level of the VCO. See the \ntruth table in Table 7. \nMute -Till- Lock Detect  \nDB11 of the control latch in the ADF4360- 7 is the  mute -till-\nlock de tect bit. This function, when enabled, ensures that the \nRF outputs are not switched on until the PLL is locked.  \nCP Gain  \nDB10 of the control latch in the ADF4360- 7 is the c harge pump \ngain bit. When it is programmed to 1, Current Se tting 2 is used. \nWhen it is programmed to 0, Current Setting 1 is used.  \nCharge Pump Three -State  \nThis bit puts the charge pump into three -state mode when  \nprogrammed to a 1. It should be set to 0 fo r normal operation.  \nPhase Detector Polarity  \nThe PDP bit in the ADF4360- 7 sets the phase detector polarity. \nThe positive setting enabled by programming a 1 is used when \nusing the on -chip VCO  with a passive loop filter or with an \nactive noninverting filter. It can also be set to 0, which is re-quired if an active inverting loop filter is used.  \nMUXOUT Control  \nThe on -chip multiplexer is controlled by M3, M2, and M1.  \nSee the truth table in Table 7. \nCounter Reset  \nDB4 is the counter reset bit for the ADF4360- 7. When this is 1, \nthe R counter and the A, B counters are reset. For normal oper-ation, this bit should  be 0.  \nCore Power Level  \nPC1 and PC2 set the power level in the VCO core. The reco m-\nmended setting is 5 mA. See the truth table in Table 7. \n \nADF4360- 7 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. F | Page 20 of 25 N COUNTER LATCH  \nTable 8 shows the input data format for pr ogrammin g the  \nN counter latch.  \nA Counter Latch  \nA5 to A1 program the 5 -bit A counter. The divide range is  \n0 (00000) to 31 (11111).  \nReserved Bits  \nDB7 is a spare bit that is  reserved. It should be programmed to 0.  \nB Counter Latch  \nB13 to B1 program the B counter. Th e divide range is 3 \n(00.....0011) to 8191 (11....111).  \nOverall Divide Range  \nThe overall divide range is defined by  ((P × B) + A ), where P  is \nthe prescaler value.  \nCP Gain  \nDB21 of the N counter latch in the ADF4360- 7 is the charge \npump gain bit. When this is programmed to 1, Current Setting 2 \nis used. When programmed to 0, Current Setting 1 is used. This bit \ncan also be programmed through DB10 of the con trol latch. The bit \nalways reflects the latest value written to it, whether this is through \nthe control latch or the N counter latch.  \nDivide -by-2 \nDB22 is the divide -by-2 bit. When set to 1, the output d ivide-by-2 \nfunction is chosen. When it is set to 0, normal operation o ccurs.  \nDivide -by-2 Selec t \nDB23 is the divide -by-2 select bit. When programmed to 1, the \ndivide -by-2 output is selected as the prescaler input. When set \nto 0, the fundamental is used as the prescaler input. For exa m-\nple, using the output divide -by-2 feature and a PFD fre quency \nof 200 kHz, the user needs a value of N = 5,000 to generate  \n500 MHz. With the divide -by-2 select bit high, the user may \nkeep N = 2,500.  R COUNTER LATCH \nWith (C2, C1) = (0, 1), the R counter latch is programmed.  \nTable 9 shows the inpu t data format for pr ogramming the  \nR counter latch.  \nR Counter  \nR1 to R14 set the counter divide ratio. The divide range is  \n1 (00......001) to 16383 (111......111).  \nAntibacklash Pulse Width  \nDB16 and DB17 set the antibacklash pulse width.  \nLock Detect Precisi on \nDB18 is the lock detect precision bit. This bit sets the number of \nreference cycles with less than 15 ns phase error for entering the \nlocked state. With LDP at 1, five cycles are taken; with LDP at 0, \nthree cycles are taken.  \nTest Mode Bit  \nDB19 is the te st mode bit (TMB) and should be set to 0. With \nTMB = 0, the contents of the test mode latch are ignored and normal operation occurs as determined by the contents of the control latch, R counter latch, and N counter latch. Note that test modes are for facto ry testing only and should not be pr o-\ngrammed by the user.  \nBand Select Clock  \nThese bits set a divider for the band select logic clock input. The \noutput of the R counter is by default the value used to clock the \nband select logic, but if this value is too high (>1 MHz), a  \ndivider can be switched on to divide the R counter output to a \nsmaller value (see Table 9). \nReserved Bits  \nDB23 to DB22 are spare bits that are r eserved. They should be \nprogrammed to 0.  \n \n \nData Sheet  ADF4360- 7 \n \nRev. F | Page 21 of 25 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nFREQUENCY GENERATOR  \nThe wide frequency range of the ADF4360- 7, plus the on -chip \ndivider, make it an ideal choice for implementing any general \npurpose clock generator or LO.  \nTo implement a cl ock generator in the FM band, it is necessary \nto use an external divider. The ADF4007 contains a hardware -\nprogrammable N divider, allowing division ratios of 8, 16, 32, \nand 64. This divided -down signal is accessed from the MU X-\nOUT pin of the ADF4007.  \nThe minimum frequency that can be fed to the ADF4007 is \n500 MHz. Th erefore,  2.2 nH inductors were used to set the  \nfundamental fr equency of oscillation at 1 GHz, with a range \nfrom 950 MHz to 1100 MHz.  This allows frequencies as low as 8 MHz and as high as \n137 MHz to be generated using a single system. In the circuit \ndrawn  in Figure 23, the ADF4360- 7 is being used to generate \n1024 MHz, and the ADF4007 is being used to divide by 8. To \nprovide a channel spacing of 100 kHz, a PFD frequency of 800 kHz is used for the ADF4360- 7 PLL. The loop bandwidth  \nis chosen to be 20 kHz.  \nThe output range of the system in  Figure 23 is approximately \n120 MHz to 135 MHz. The output phase noise is −104 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset. Using different inductor values allows the ADF4360- 7 to be u sed to synthesize any different range of  \nfrequencies over the oper ation of the device  (235 MHz to  \n1800 MHz).  \n \nADF4007TO LO\nPORTVP\nREF IN\nRFINAM2 M1 CP RSET\nMUXOUTPHASE\nFREQUENCY\nDETECTOR\nR COUNTER\n÷2VDD\nRFINB\nN2 N1\n04441-027SPI COMPATIBLE SERIAL BUSADF4360-7VVCOVVCO\nVVCO\nCPGND AGND DGND\nGND CPGNDL1L2RFOUTBRFOUTAFREF INCP\n1nF470pF\n2.2nH2.2nH220pF6.8nF\n51Ω51Ω\n51Ω4.7kΩ\n100pF100pF1nF1nF10µF\n4.7kΩ6.2kΩ13kΩ\nRSETCCLEDATACLKREF INCNVTUNE DVDDAVDDCEMUXOUT\n5424720 23 2 21 6\n14\n16\n17\n18\n19\n13\n1 3 8 910 1122 1512VDDVDD\nLOCK\nDETECT\nCHARGE\nPUMPMUX\nN COUNTER\n÷8,÷16,\n÷32,÷64\n \nFigure 23.

F | Page 22 of 25 CHOOSING THE CORRECT  INDUCTANCE VALU E \nThe ADF4360- 7 can be used at many different frequencies  \nsimply by choosing the external inductors to give the correct \noutput frequency. Figure 24 shows a graph of both minimum \nand maximum frequency vs. the e xternal indu ctor value. The \ncorrect inductor should cover the maximum and minimum \nfrequencies desired. The inductors used are the 0402 CS type \nfrom Coilcraft. To reduce mutual coupling, place  the inductors \nat right angles to one another.  \nAs shown  in Figure 24, the lowest commercially available value of \ninductance , 1.0 nH, sets the center frequency at approximat ely \n1300 MHz. For inductances less than 2.4 nH, use a PCB trace, a \ndirect short. The lowest center fr equency  of oscillation possible \nis approximately 350 MHz, which is achieved using 30 nH in-ductors. This relationship can be e xpressed by  \n( )1\n2π 6.2 pF 0.9 nHO\nEXTF\nL=\n+ \nwhere FO is the center frequency, and L EXT is the external i n-\nductance.  \n300500\n400120013001400\n10001100\n800900\n6007001500\n0 5 10 15 20 30 25\nEXT INDUCTANCE (nH)FREQUENCY (MHz)\n04441-028\n \nFigure 24. Output Center Frequency vs. External Indu ctor Value  \nThe approximate value of capacitance at the midpoint of the center band of the VCO  is 6.2 pF, and the approx imate value of \ninternal inductance due to the bond wires is 0.9 nH. The VCO sensitivity is a measure of the frequency change vs . the tuning \nvoltage. It is a very important parameter for the low- pass filter. \nFigure 25 shows a graph of the tuning sensiti vity (in MHz/V) \nvs. the inductance (nH). It can be seen that as the  inductance  \nincreases, the sensitivity decreases. This relationship can be derived from the previous equation ; that is , because  the indu ct-\nance has increased, the change in capacitance from the va ractor \nhas less of an effect on the frequency.  0530\n25\n20\n15\n1035\n0 10 20 40 30\nEXT INDUCTANCE (nH)SENSITIVITY (MHz/V)\n04441-029\n \nFigure 25. Tuning Sensitivity (in MHz/V) vs. Inductance (nH)  \nCHOOSING THE APPROPR IATE PFD FREQUENCY  \nSome timing uncertainty exists for high PFD frequencies, as \nwell as in low VCO frequencies in which the ADF4360- 7 selects \na VCO frequency band that does not provide  optimal perfor-\nmance. For guidelines choosing the appropriate PFD frequency, \nrefer to the AN-1347 Application Note, Operating the ADF4360-\n7 at High PFD Frequencies. \nFIXED FREQUENCY LO  \nFigure 26 shows the ADF4360- 7 used  as a fixed frequency LO at \n500 MHz. The low -pass filter was designed using ADIsimPLL  \nfor a channel spacing of 8 MHz and an open -loop bandwidth of \n30 kHz. The maximum PFD frequency of the ADF4360- 7 is  \n8 MHz. Because  using a larger PFD frequency allows the use of \na smaller N, the in -band phase noise is reduced to as low as \npossible, −109 dBc/Hz. The typical rms phase noise (1 00 Hz to  \n100 kHz) of the LO in this configuration is 0.3°. The reference \nfrequency is from a 16 MHz TCXO from Fox; thus, an R value of \n2 is pr ogrammed. Taking into account the high PFD frequency \nand its effect on the band select logic, the band select clo ck  \ndivider is enabled. In this case, a value of 8 is chosen. A very si m-\nple pull -up resistor and dc blocking capacitor complete the RF \noutput stage.

Fixed Frequency LO  \nData Sheet  ADF4360- 7 \n \nRev. F | Page 23 of 25 INTERFACING  \nThe ADF4360- 7 has a simple SPI® -compatible serial inte rface \nfor writing to the device. CLK, DATA, and LE control the data \ntransfer. When LE goes high, the 24 bits that have been clocked \ninto the appropriate register on each ris ing edge of CLK are \ntransferred to the appropriate latch. See Figure 2 for the timing \ndiagram and Table 5 for the latch truth table.  \nThe maximum allowable serial clock rate is 20 MHz. This \nmeans that the m aximum update rate possible is 833 kHz or \none update every 1.2 µs. This is certainly more than ad equate \nfor systems that have typical lock times in hundreds of micr o-\nseconds.  \nADuC812 Interface  \nFigure 27 shows the interface between the ADF4360- 7 and the \nADuC812 MicroConverter®. Because  the ADuC812 is based on \nan 8051 core, this interface can be used with any 8051- based \nmicrocontroller. The MicroConverter is set up for SPI master \nmode with CPHA = 0. To initiate the operation, the  I/O port \ndriving LE is brought low. Each latch of the ADF4360- 7 needs a \n24-bit word, which is acco mplished by writing three 8 -bit bytes \nfrom the MicroConverter to the device. After the thi rd byte has \nbeen written, the LE input should be brought high to complete the transfer.  \n04441-031ADuC812 ADF4360-7SCLK\nSDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)SCLOCK\nMOSI\nI/O PORTS\n \nFigure 27. ADuC812 to ADF4360 -7 Interface \nI/O port lines on the ADuC812 are also used to control pow-\nerdown (CE input) and detect lock (MUXOUT configured as lock detect and polled by the port input). W hen operating in \nthe described mode, the maximum SCLOCK rate of the \nADuC812 is 4 MHz. This means that the maximum rate at \nwhich the ou tput frequency can be changed is 166 kHz.  ADSP -2181 Interface  \nFigu re 28 shows the interface between the ADF4360- 7 and the \nADSP -2181 digital signal processor. The ADF4360- 7 needs a \n24-bit serial word for each latch write. The eas iest way to ac-\ncomplish this using the ADSP -2181 is to use the autobuffered \ntransmit mode of operation with alternate fra ming. This pro-\nvides a means for transmitting an entire block of serial data before an interrupt is generated.  \n04441-032ADSP-2181ADF4360-7SCLK\nSDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)SCLOCK\nMOSI\nTFS\nI/O PORTS\n \nFigu re 28.

To program each 24 -bit latch, store \nthe 8 -bit bytes, enable the autobuffered mode, and write to the \ntransmit register of the DSP . This last operation initiates the autobuffer transfer.  \nPCB DESIGN GUIDELINE S FOR CHIP SCALE PAC KAGE  \nThe leads on the chip sca le package (CP -24) are rectangular. \nThe printed circuit board pad for these should be 0.1 mm lon g-\ner than the package lead length and 0.05 mm wider than the package lead width. The lead should be centered on the pad to \nensure th at the solder joint size is maximized.  \nThe bottom of the chip scale package has a central thermal pad. The thermal pad on the printed circuit board should be at least \nas large as this exposed pad. On the printed circuit board, there should be a clearance of at least 0.25 mm between the thermal pad and the inner edges of the pad pattern to ensure that shor t-\ning is avoided.  \nThermal vias may be used on the printed circuit board thermal \npad to improve thermal performance of the package. If vias  \nare used, they  should be incorporat ed into the thermal pad at a \n1.2 mm pitch grid. The via diameter should be between 0.3 mm and 0.33 mm, and the via barrel should be plated with 1 ounce of copper to plug the via.  \nThe user should connect the printed circuit thermal pad  to \nAGND. This is internally connected to AGND.  \n \n \n \nADF4360- 7 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. F | Page 24 of 25 OUTPUT MATCHING  \nThere are a number of ways to match the output of the \nADF4360- 7 for optimum operation; the most basic is to use a \n50 Ω resistor to V VCO. A dc bypass capacitor of 100 pF is co n-\nnected in series , as shown in Figure 29. Because the resi stor is \nnot frequency dependent, this provides a good broadban d \nmatch. The output power in this  circuit typically gives  \n−5 dBm ou tput power into a 50 Ω load.  \n100pF\n04441-033RFOUTVVCO\n50Ω51Ω\n \nFigure 29. Simple ADF4360 -7 Output Stage  \nA better solution is to  use a shunt inductor (acting as an RF \nchoke) to V VCO. This gives a better match and, therefore, more  \noutput power. Additionally, a series inductor is added after the \ndc bypass capacitor to provide a resonant LC circuit. This tunes \nthe oscillator output a nd provides approximately 10 dB addi-\ntional r ejection of the second harmonic. The shunt inductor \nneeds to be a rel atively high value (>40 nH).  \nExperiments have shown that the circuit shown in Figure 30 \nprovides an ex cellent match t o 50 Ω over a limited operating \nrange of the ADF4360- 7 (850 MHz to 950 MHz). This gives \napproximately −2 dBm output power across the specific  \nfrequency range of the ADF4360- 7 using 3.9 nH. For other  \nfrequencies, a tuned LC is recommended. Both complementary \narchitectures can be examined using the EV -ADF4360- 7EB1Z  \nevalu ation board.  \n7.5nH47nH\n3.9pF\n04441-034RFOUTVVCO\n50Ω\n \nFigure 30. Optimum ADF4360 -7 Output Stage  If the user does not need the differential outputs available  on the ADF4360- 7, the user may either terminate the unused \noutput or combine both outputs using a balun. The circuit in \nFigure 31 shows how best to combine the outputs.  \n7.5nH9.0nH 47nH\n9.0nH3.3pF100pF\n3.3pF50Ω\n7.5nHRFOUTAVVCO\nRFOUTB\n04441-035 \nFigure 31. Balun for Combining ADF4360 -7 RF Outputs  \nThe circuit in Figure 31 is a lumped -lattice -type LC balun. It  \nis designed for a center frequency of 900 MHz an d outputs  \n5.0 dBm  at this frequency. The series 7.5 nH inductor is used to \ntune out any par asitic capacitance due to the board layout from \neach input, and the remainder of the circuit is used to shift the  \noutput of one RF input by +90° and the second by −90°, thus \ncombining the two. The action of the 9.0 nH inductor and the \n3.3 pF capacitor accomplishes this. The 47 nH is used to pr o-\nvide an RF choke to feed the supply voltage, and the 100 pF capacitor provides the necessary dc block. To ensure good RF \nperformance, the circuits in Figure 30 and Figure 31 are impl e-\nmented with Coilcraft 0402/0603 inductors and AVX 0402 thin -\nfilm capac itors.  \nAlternatively, instead of the LC balun shown in Figure 31, both \noutputs may be combined using a 180° rat -race coupler.  \n \n \n \nData Sheet  ADF4360- 7 \n \nRev.
