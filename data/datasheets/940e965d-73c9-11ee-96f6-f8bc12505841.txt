It provides an absolutely unique i dentity that can be determined with a minimal electronic \ninterface (typically, a single port pin of a microcontroller). The DS2411’s registration number is a 64-bit  \nunique ROM that includes a unique 48-bit serial number, an 8-bit CRC, and an 8-bit family c ode (01h). \nData is transferred serially through the Analog Devices  1-Wire protocol. For the DS2411, an external \npower supply is required, extending the operating voltage range of the device below typical 1-W ire \ndevices. The DS2411A does not require an extern al power supply and has a typical 1-Wire operating \nvoltage range. However, it is functional ly equivalent to the DS2411, but with differing electrical \nparameters.

Not production tested.  \nNote 5:  Maximum value represents the internal parasite capacitance when V PUP is first applied. Once the \nparasite capacitance is charged, it does not affect normal communication.  \nNote 6:  The voltage on I /O must be less than or equal to V ILMAX whenever the master drives the line low . \nNote 7:  The i nterval after t RSTL during which a bus m aster can read a logic ‘0’ on I/O if there is a DS28E07 \npresent. The power -up presence detect pulse could be outside this interval but will be complete \nwithin 1.5ms (DS2411) or 2ms (DS2411A) after power -up. \nNote 8:  ε in Figure 7 represents  the time required  for the pullup circuitry  to pull the voltage on I /O up from \nVIL to V IH. The actual  maximum duration for the master to pull the line low is t W1LMAX  + tF - ε and \ntW0LMAX  + tF - ε, respectively.  \nNote 9:  δ in Figure 7 represents the time required for the pul lup circuitry to pull the voltage on I /O up from \nVIL to the input -high threshold of the bus master. The actual maximum duration for the master to \npull the line low is t RLMAX  + tF. \nNote 10:  VTL and V TH are functions of V CC and temperature. The V TH and V TL maximum specifications are \nvalid at V CC = 5.25V. In any case, V TL < V TH < V CC. \nNote 11:  Voltage below which during a falling edge on I/O, a logic ‘0’ is detected.  \nNote 12:  Voltage above which during a rising edge on I/O, a logic ‘1’ is detected.  \nNote 13:  After V TH is crossed during a rising edge on I/O, the voltage on I/O has to drop by V HY to be \ndetected as logic ‘0’.  \nNote 14:  The I -V characteristic is linear for voltages less than 1V.  \nNote 15:  The earliest recognition of a negative edge is possible at t REH after V TH has been reached on the \nprevious edge.  \nNote 16:  The i nterval during the negative edge on I/O at the beginning of a presence- detect pulse between \nthe time at which the voltage is 90% of V PUP and the time the voltage is 10% of V PUP. \nNote 17:  The i nterval begins when the voltage drops below V TL during a negative edge on I/O and ends \nwhen the voltage rises above V TH during a positive edge on I/O.  \nNote 18:  VTL, VTH, and V HY are a function of the internal supply voltage, which is a function of V PUP, R PUP,  \n1-Wire timing, and capacitive loading on I /O. Lower V PUP, higher R PUP, shorter t REC, and heavier \ncapacitive loading al l lead to lower values of V TL, VTH, and V HY. \nNote 19:  Defines the maximum possible bit rate. Equal to 1/(t W0LMIN  + tRECMIN ). \n \n \n \nOPERA TION \nThe DS2411’s registration number is accessed through a single data line. The 48-bit serial number, 8-bit \nfamily code, and 8-bit CRC are retrieved using the An alog Devices  1-Wire protocol. This protocol defines \nbus transactions in terms of the bus state during specified time slots that are bus -master -generated \nfalling edges on the I/O pin. All data is read and written least significant bit first. The DS2411 requires a \ndelay between V CC power -up and initial 1-Wire communication, t PWRP  (1200µ s). The DS2411A requires \na delay between I/O power -up and initial 1-Wire communication of 2ms.  During this time the DS2411 or \nDS2411A  may issue presence-detect pulses.  \n \n1-Wire BUS SYSTEM  \nThe 1-Wire bus has a single bus master and one or more slaves. In all instances, the DS2411 is a slave \ndevice. The bus master is typically a microcontroller . The discussion of this bus  system is broken down \ninto three topics: hardware configuration, transaction sequence, and 1-Wire signaling (signal type and timing). \n \nDS2411  \n 5 of 13  Hardware Configura tion \nThe 1-Wire bus has a single data line, I/O. It is important that each device on the bus be able to drive I/O \nat the appropriate time. To facilitate this, each device has an open-drain or three -state output. The \nDS2411 has an open-drain output with an internal circuit equivalent to that shown in Figure 3. The bus master can have the same equivalent circuit. If a bidirectional pin is not available on the master, separate output and input pins can be connected together. The bus requires a pullup resistor at the master end of the bus, as shown in Figure 4. A multidrop bus consists of a 1-Wire bus with multiple slaves attached. The 1- Wire bus has a maximum data rate of 15.4kbps in standard speed and 125kbps \nin overdrive.  \n \nThe idle state for the 1-Wire bus is  high. If a transaction needs to be suspended for any reason, I/O must \nremain high if the transaction is to be resumed. If the bus is pulled low, slave devices on the bus will interpret the low as either a timeslot, or a reset depending on the duration. \n \nFigure 1.

The optimal \nvalue depends on the 1 -Wire communication speed and \nthe bus load chara cteristics.   \n \n \nDS2411  \n 7 of 13  TRANSACTION SEQUENCE \nThe communication sequence for accessing the DS2411 through the 1-Wire bus is as follows:  \n \n\uf0a7 Initialization  \n\uf0a7 ROM Function Command \n\uf0a7 Read Data \n \nINITIALIZATION  \nAll tran sactions on the 1-Wire bus begin with an initialization sequence. The initialization sequence \nconsists o f a reset pulse transmitted by the bus master followed by a presence pulse(s) transmitted by \nthe slave(s). The presence pulse lets the bus master know tha t the DS2411 is on the bus and is ready to \noperate. For more details, see the 1- Wire Signaling section. \n \nROM FUNCTION COMMANDS  \nOnce the bus master has detected a presence, it can issue one of the three ROM function commands. \nAll ROM fu nction command codes are 1 byte long. A list of these commands follows (see the flowchart in \nFigure 5). \n \nRead ROM [33h]  \nThis command allows the bus master to read the DS2411’s 8-bit family code, unique 48-bit serial \nnumber, and 8-bit CRC. This command should only be used if t here is a single slave device on the bus. \nIf more than one slave is present on the bus, a data collision results when all slaves try to transmit at the \nsame time (open drain produces a wired-AND result), and the resulting registration number read by the master will be invalid.  \n \nSearch ROM [F0h]  \nWhen a system is initially brought up, the bus master might not know the number of devices on the 1-Wire bus or their registration numbers. By taking advantage of the wired-AND property of the bus,  the \nmaster can use a process of elimination to identify the registration numbers of all slave devices. For \neach bit of the registration number, starting with the least significant bit, the bus master issues a triplet of time slots. On the first slot, each slave device par ticipating in the search outputs the true value of its \nregistration number bit. On the second slot, each slave device participating in the search outputs the \ncomplemented value of its registration number bit. On the third slot, the master writes the true v alue of \nthe bit to be selected. All slave devices that do not match the bit written by the master stop participating \nin the search. If both of the read bits are zero, the master knows that slave devices exist with both states of the bit. By choosing which st ate to write, the bus master branches in the romcode tree. After one \ncomplete pass, the bus master knows the registration number of a single device. Additional passes \nidentify the registration numbers of the remaining devices. Refer to \nApp Note 187: 1-Wire Search \nAlgorithm  for  a detailed discussion, including an example.  \n \nOverdrive Skip ROM [3Ch] \nThis command causes all overdrive-capable slave devices on the 1-Wire network to enter overdrive \nspeed (OD = 1). All communication following this command has to occur at overdrive speed until a reset \npulse of minimum 480 µs duration resets all devices on the bus to regular speed (OD = 0).  \n \nTo subsequently address a specific overdrive-supporting device, a reset pulse at overdrive speed has to \nbe issued followed by a read ROM or search ROM command sequence. Overdrive speeds up the time \nfor the search process.  \n \nDS2411  \n 8 of 13  Figure 5.

The protocol consists of four types of \nsignaling on one line: Reset Sequence with Reset Pulse and Presence Pulse, Write 0, Write 1, and \nRead Data. Except for the presence pulse the bus master initiates all these signals. The DS2411 can \ncommunicate at two different speeds: standard speed and Overdrive speed. If not explicitly set into the \nOverdrive mode, the DS2411 will  communicate at standard speed. While in Overdrive Mode the fast \ntiming applies to all waveforms.   \nTo get from idle to active, the v oltage on the 1- Wire line needs to fall from V\nPUP below the threshold V TL. \nTo get from active to idle, the voltage needs to rise from V ILMAX past the threshold V TH. The voltage V ILMAX \nis relevant for the DS2411 when determi ning a logical level, but not for  triggering any events.  \n \nThe initialization sequence required to begin any communication with the DS2411 is shown in Figur e 6. \nA Reset Pulse followed by a Presence Pulse indicates the DS2411 is ready to receive data, given the \ncorrect ROM and memory function command. In a mixed population network, the reset low time t RSTL \nneeds to be long enough for the slowest 1-Wire slave device to recognize it as a reset pulse. If the bus \nmaster uses slew -rate control on the falling edge, it must pull down the line for tRSTL + tF to compensate \nfor the edge. A t RSTL duration of 480µs or longer will exit the Overdrive Mode returning the devic e to \nstandard speed. If the DS2411 is in Overdrive Mode and t RSTL is no longer than 80µs, the device will \nremain in Overdrive Mode. \n \nAfter the bus master has released the line it goes into receive mode (RX). Now, the 1-Wire bus is pulled \nto V PUP via the pullup resistor or, in case of a DS2480B driver, by active circuitry. When the threshold V TH \nis crosse d, the DS2411 waits for t PDH and then transmits a Presence Pulse by pulling the line low for t PDL. \nTo detect a presence pulse, the master must test the logi cal state of the 1 -Wire line at t MSP.  \n The t\nRSTH window must be at least the sum of t PDHMAX , tPDLMA X, and t RECMIN . Immediately after  tRSTH is \nexpired, the DS2411 is ready for data communication. In a mixed population network, t RSTH should be \nextended to m inimum 480µs at standard speed and 48µs at Overdrive speed to accommodate other 1-\nWire devices.  \n \n \nRead/Write Time Slots  \nData communi cation with the DS2411 takes place in time slots that carry a single bit each. Write time \nslots transport data from bus mas ter to slave. Read time-slots transfer data from slave to master. The \ndefinitions of the write and r ead time slots are illustrated in Figure 7.  \n All communication begins with the master pulling the data line low. As the voltage on the 1-Wire line falls \nbelow the threshold V\nTL, the DS2411 starts its internal timing generator that determines when the data  \nline will be sampled during a wr ite time slot and how long data will be valid during a read time slot.  \n \nMaster to Slave \nFor a write -one time slot, the vol tage on the data line must have crossed the V THMAX  threshold after the \nwrite -one low time t W1LMAX  is expired. For a write -zero  time s lot, the voltage on the data line must stay \nbelow the V THMIN threshold until the write-zero low time t W0LMIN  is expired. For most reliable \ncommunication the voltage on the data line should not exceed V ILMAX during the entir e tW0L window. After \nthe V THMAX  threshold has been crossed, the DS2411 needs a recovery time t REC before it is ready for the \nnext time slot. \n \nDS2411  \n 10 of 13 INITIALIZATION PROCEDURE  \nFigure 6.

Read -Data Time Slot  \n \n \nDS2411  \n 11 of 13 Slave to Master  \nA read-data  time slot begins like a write-one time sl ot. The voltage on the data line must remain below \nVTLMIN until the read low time t RL is expired. During the t RL window, when responding with a 0, the \nDS2411 will start pulling the data line low; its internal timing generator determines when this pull -down \nends and the voltage starts risi ng again. When responding with a 1, the DS2411 will not hold the data \nline low at all, and the voltage starts rising as soo n as t RL is over.  \n \nThe sum of t RL + δ (rise rime) on one side and the internal timing generator of the DS2411 on the other \nside defi ne the master sampling window (t MSRMIN  to t MSRMAX ) in which the master must perform a read \nfrom the data line. For most rel iable communication, t RL should be as short as permissible and the \nmaster should read close to but no later than t MSRMAX . After readi ng from the data line, the master must \nwait until t SLOT is expired. This guarantees sufficient recovery time t REC for the D S2411 to get ready for \nthe next time slot.  \n \n \nImproved Network Behavior  \nIn a 1-Wire environment, line termination is possible only during transients controlled by the bus master \n(1-Wire driver). 1 -Wire networks therefore are susceptible to noise of various  origins. Depending on the \nphysical size and topology of the network, reflections from end points and branch points can add up or \ncancel each other to some extent. Such reflections are visible as glitches or ringing on the 1-Wire communication line. A glitch during the rising edge of a time slot can cause a slave device to lose \nsynchronization with the m aster and, as a consequence, result in a search ROM command coming to a \ndead end. For better performance in network applications, the DS2411 uses a new 1-Wire front end, \nwhich makes it less sensitive to noise and also reduces the magnitude of noise injected by the slave \ndevice itself.   \nThe 1-Wire front end of the DS2411 differs from traditional slave devices in four characteristics.  \n1) The falling edge of the presence pulse has a controlled slew rate. This provides a better match to the \nline impedance than a  digitally switched transistor, c onverting the high frequency ringing known from \ntraditional devices into a smoother low -bandwidth transition. The slew rate control is specified by the \nparameter t\nFPD, which has different values for standard and Overdrive s peed. This function is only \navailable for the V CC-powered version. \n2) There is additional low -pass filtering in the circuit that detects the falling edge at the beginning of a \ntime slot. This reduces the sensitivity to high-frequency noise. As a consequence, the duration of the \nsetup time t SU at standard speed is larger than with traditional devices.  This additional filtering does \nnot apply at Overdrive speed.  \n3) There is a hysteresis at the low -to-high switching threshold VTH. If a negative glitch crosses V TH but \ndoesn’t go below V TH - VHY, it will not be recognized (Figure 8, Case A). The hysteresis i s effective at \nany 1-Wire speed.  \n4) There is a time window specified by the rising edge hold-off time t REH during which glitc hes will be \nignored, even if they extend below V TH - VHY threshold (Figure 8, Case B, t GL < tREH). Deep voltage \ndroops or glitches that appear late after crossing the V TH threshold and extend beyond the t REH \nwindow cannot be filtered out and will be taken as beginning of a new time slot (Figure 8, Case C, t GL \n≥ tREH). The duration of the hold-off time is independent of the 1-Wire speed. \nOnly devices which have the parameters  VHY and t REH specified in their electrical characteristics use the \nimproved 1-Wire front end. \n \nDS2411  \n 12 of 13  NOISE SUPPRESSION SCHEME Figure 8  \nVPUP\nVTH\nVHY\n0VtREH\ntGLtREH\ntGLCase A Case C Case B\n \n \nCRC GENERATION  \nTo validate the registration number transmitted from the DS2411, the bus master can generate a CRC \nvalue from the 8-bit family code and unique 48-bit serial number as it is received. If the CRC matches the last 8 bits of the registration number, the transmission is error free.  \n \nThe equivalent polynomial function of this CRC is: CRC = x8 + x5 + x4 + 1.
