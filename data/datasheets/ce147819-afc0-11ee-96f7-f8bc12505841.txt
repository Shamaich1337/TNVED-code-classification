It does this by controlling the gate voltages of \na pair of external N-channel MOSFETs to ensure that the \noutput stays within a safe operating range.The LTC4367 \nwithstands voltages between –40V and 100V and has an \noperating range of 2.5V to 60V, while consuming only \n70µA in normal operation.\nT wo comparator inputs allow configuration of the over -\nvoltage (OV) and undervoltage (UV) set points using an \nexternal resistive divider.  A shutdown pin provides external \ncontrol for enabling and disabling the MOSFETs as well \nas placing the device in a low current shutdown state.  A \nfault output indicates that the GATE pin is pulling low when \nthe part is in shutdown or the input voltage is outside the \nUV and OV set points.\nThe LTC4367 has a 32ms turn-on delay that debounces \nlive connections and blocks 50Hz to 60Hz AC power. For \nfast recovery after faults, the LTC4367-1 has a reduced  \nturn-on delay of 500µs.\nVALID WINDOW\nV\nIN\nV\nIN\nV\nOUT\nV\nOUT\nOV = 36V\nUV = 7V\n200ms/DIV\n–40V\n20V/DIV\nGND\n4367 TA01b\n+70V\n20V/DIV\nVIN\nUV\nOVSHDN\nOV = 36V\nUV = 7V\n4367 TA01aVOUT\nFAULTGATEVIN\n24VVOUT\n2ASi7942\nGND\nLTC43671500k\n121k\n29.4k464k\nLTC43672\nRev.

This high voltage open drain \noutput is pulled low if UV is below its monitor threshold, \nif OV is above its monitor threshold, if SHDN is low, or if \nVIN has not risen above V IN(UVLO) .\nGATE: Gate Drive Output for External N-channel MOSFETs. \nAn internal charge pump provides 35µA of pull-up current \nand up to 13.1V of enhancement to the gate of an external \nN-channel MOSFET. When turned off, GATE is pulled just \nbelow the lower of V IN or V OUT. When V IN goes negative, \nGATE is automatically connected to V IN.\nGND: Device Ground.\nOV: Overvoltage Comparator Input. Connect this pin to an \nexternal resistive divider to set the desired V IN overvoltage \nfault threshold. This input connects to an accurate, fast \n(1µs) comparator with a 0.5V rising threshold and 25mV \nof hysteresis. When OV rises above its threshold, a 60mA \ncurrent sink pulls down on the GATE output. When OV falls \nback below 0.475V, and after a 32ms GATE turn-on delay \nwaiting period (500µs for LTC4367-1), the GATE charge \npump is enabled. The low leakage current of the OV input \nallows the use of large valued resistors for the external \nresistive divider. Connect to GND if unused. If the voltage \nat the OV pin can rise above 5V, place a low leakage Zener \nclamp on the OV pin.SHDN : Shutdown Control Input. SHDN high enables the \nGATE charge pump which in turn enhances the gate of an \nexternal N-channel MOSFET.  A low on SHDN generates a \npull down on the GATE output with a 90µA current sink \nand places the LTC4367 in low current mode ( 5µA). If \nunused,  connect to V IN with a 510k resistor.  If V IN goes \nabove 80V, the SHDN pin voltage must be kept below 80V \n(see Applications Information).\nUV: Undervoltage Comparator Input.  Connect this pin to an \nexternal resistive divider to set the desired V IN undervolt -\nage fault threshold. This input connects to an accurate, \nfast (1µs) comparator with a 0.5V falling threshold and \n25mV of hysteresis. When UV falls below its threshold, a \n60mA current sink pulls down on the GATE output. When \nUV rises back above 0.525V, and after a 32ms GATE turn-\non delay waiting period (500µs for LTC4367-1), the GATE \ncharge pump is enabled. The low leakage current of the \nUV input allows the use of large valued resistors for the \nexternal resistive divider. If unused and V IN is less than \n80V, connect to V IN with a 510k resistor.\nVIN: Power Supply Input. Maximum protection range: \n–40V to 100V.

Figure\xa0 1 shows a supply ar -\nrangement using a DC barrel connector. Power is supplied \nby an AC adaptor or, if the plug is withdrawn, by a remov -\nable battery. Note that the polarity of the AC adaptor and \nbarrel connector varies by manufacturer. T rouble arises \nwhen any of the following occurs:\n• The battery is installed backwards\n• An AC adaptor of opposite polarity is attached\n• An AC adaptor of excessive voltage is attached\n• The battery is discharged below a safe level\nThis can lead to supply voltages that are too high, too \nlow, or even negative. If these power sources are applied \ndirectly to the electronic systems, the systems could be \nsubject to damage. The LTC4367 is an input voltage fault \nprotection N-channel MOSFET controller.  The part isolates \nan input supply from its load to protect the load from \nFigure\xa01. Polarity Protection for DC Barrel Connectorsunexpected supply voltage conditions, while providing a \nlow loss path for qualified power.\nIn the past, to protect electronic systems from improperly \nconnected power supplies, system designers often added \ndiscrete diodes,  transistors and high voltage comparators. \nThe high voltage comparators enable system power only \nif the input supply falls within a desired voltage window. \nA Schottky diode or P-channel MOSFET typically added \nin series with the supply protects against reverse supply \nconnections.\nThe LTC4367 provides accurate overvoltage and undervolt -\nage comparators to ensure that power is applied to the \nsystem only if the input supply meets the user selectable \nvoltage window. Reverse supply protection circuits au -\ntomatically isolate the load from negative input voltages. \nDuring normal operation, a high voltage charge pump \nenhances the gate of external N-channel power MOSFETs. \nPower consumption is 5µA during shutdown and 70µA \nwhile operating. The LTC4367 integrates all these func -\ntions in 8-lead MSOP and 3mm × 3mm DFN packages. \nVIN\nUV\nOVSHDN\n2.5V TO 60V\nOPERATING RANGE\n4367 F01VOUT\nFAULTGATE\nGNDLTC4367\nR3–40V TO 100V PROTECTION RANGE\nAC\nADAPTOR\nINPUT\nOV, UV PROTECTION\nTHRESHOLDS SET TO\nSATISFY LOAD CIRCUIT\nR2\nR1R4M1 M2\nLOAD\nCIRCUIT+\n–BATTERY\nLTC436710\nRev.

A basic \napplication circuit using the LTC4367 is shown in Figure\xa0 2 \nThe circuit provides a low loss connection from V IN to \nVOUT as long as the voltage at V IN is between 3.5V and \n18V. Voltages at V IN outside of the 3.5V to 18V range are \nprevented from getting to the load and can be as high as \n100V and as low as –40V. The circuit of Figure\xa0 2 protects \nagainst negative voltages at V IN as shown.  No other external \ncomponents are needed.\nDuring normal operation, the LTC4367 provides up to \n13.1V of gate enhancement to the external back-to-back \nN-channel MOSFETs. This turns on the MOSFETs, thus \nconnecting the load at V OUT to the supply at V IN.GATE Drive\nThe LTC4367 turns on the external N-channel MOSFETs by \ndriving the GATE pin above V OUT. The voltage difference \nbetween the GATE and V OUT pins (gate drive) is a function \nof V IN and V OUT.\nFigure\xa0 3 highlights the dependence of the gate drive on V IN \nand V OUT. When system power is first turned on (SHDN \nlow to high, V OUT = 0V), gate drive is at a maximum for all \nvalues of V IN. This helps prevent start-up problems into \nheavy loads by ensuring that there is enough gate drive \nto support the load.\nAs V OUT ramps up from 0V, the absolute value of the GATE \nvoltage remains fixed until V OUT is greater than the lower \nof (VIN – 1V) or 5V. Once V OUT crosses this threshold, \ngate drive begins to increase up to a maximum of 13.1V \n(for V IN ≥ 12V). The curves of Figure\xa0 3 were taken with \na GATE load of –1µA. If there were no load on GATE, the \ngate drive for each V IN would be slightly higher.\nNote that when V IN is at the lower end of the operating \nrange, the external N-channel MOSFET must be selected \nwith a corresponding lower threshold voltage.\nFigure\xa02.

If the input supply rises above the user adjustable \nOV threshold, the gate of the external MOSFET is quickly \nturned off, thus disconnecting the load from the input. \nSimilarly, if the input supply falls below the user adjust -\nable UV threshold, the gate of the external MOSFET also \nis quickly turned off. Figure\xa0 4 shows a UV/OV application \nfor an input supply of 12V.\nThe external resistive divider allows the user to select \nan input supply range that is compatible with the load at \nVOUT. Furthermore, the UV and OV inputs have very low \nleakage currents (typically < 1nA at 100°C), allowing for \nlarge values in the external resistive divider. In the applica -\ntion of Figure\xa0 4, the load is connected to the supply only if \nVIN lies between 3.5V and 18V. In the event that V IN goes \nabove 18V or below 3 .5V, the gate of the external N-channel \nMOSFET is immediately discharged with a 60mA current \nsink, thus isolating the load from the supply.

Procedure for Selecting UV/ OV External Resistor Values\nThe following 3-step procedure helps select the resistor \nvalues for the resistive divider of Figure\xa0 4. This procedure \nminimizes UV and OV offset errors caused by leakage \ncurrents at the respective pins.\n 1. Choose maximum tolerable offset error at the UV pin,  \n  V OS(UV) . Divide by the worst case leakage current at  \n  the UV pin , ILEAK (10nA ). Set the sum of R1 + R2 equal  \n  to V OS(UV)  divided by 10nA. Note that due to the  \n  presence of R3, the actual offset at UV will be slightly  \n  lower:\n    R1+R2�VOS(UV)\nILEAK\n 2. Select the desired V IN UV trip threshold, UV TH.

The input \nsupply must remain within the user selected power good \nwindow for at least 32ms (tD(ON) ) before the load is again \nconnected to the supply. This GATE turn-on delay period \nfilters noise (including line noise) at the input supply and \nprevents chattering of power at the load. For applications \nthat require faster turn-on after a fault, the LTC4367-1 \nprovides a 500µs GATE turn-on delay.\nLTC436713\nRev.

If \nthe input supply is plugged in backwards, or a negative \nsupply is inadvertently connected, the LTC4367 prevents \nthis negative voltage from passing to the output load.\nThe LTC4367 employs a novel, high speed reverse supply \nvoltage monitor.  When the negative V IN voltage is detected, \nan internal switch connects the gates of the external back-\nto-back N-channel MOSFETs to the negative input supply. As shown in Figure\xa0 7, external back-to-back N-channel \nMOSFETs are required for reverse supply protection.  When \nVIN goes negative, the reverse V IN comparator closes the \ninternal switch, which in turn connects the gates of the \nexternal MOSFETs to the negative V IN voltage. The body \ndiode (D1) of M1 turns on, but the body diode (D2) of \nM2 remains in reverse blocking mode. This means that \nthe common source connection of M1 and M2 remains \nabout a diode drop higher than V IN. Since the gate voltage \nof M2 is shorted to V IN, M2 will be turned off and no cur -\nrent can flow from V IN to the load at V OUT. Note that the \nvoltage rating of M2 must withstand the reverse voltage \nexcursion at V IN.\nFigure\xa0 8 illustrates the waveforms that result when V IN \nis hot plugged to –20V. V IN, GATE and V OUT start out at \nground just before the connection is made. Due to the \nparasitic inductance of the V IN and GATE connections, the \nvoltage at the V IN and GATE pins ring significantly below \n–20V. Therefore, a 40V N-channel MOSFET was selected \nto survive the overshoot.\nThe speed of the LTC4367 reverse protection circuits is \nevident by how closely the GATE pin follows V IN during \nthe negative transients. The two waveforms are almost \nindistinguishable on the scale shown. \nThe trace at V OUT, on the other hand, does not respond \nto the negative voltage at V IN, demonstrating the desired \nreverse supply protection . The waveforms of Figure\xa0 8 were \ncaptured using a 40V dual N-channel MOSFET, a 10µF \nceramic output capacitor and no load current on V OUT.\nFigure\xa07.

C For more information www.analog.comGATE Turn-On Delay Timer\nThe LTC4367 has a GATE turn-on delay timer that filters \nnoise at V IN and helps prevent chatter at V OUT. After either \nan OV or UV fault has occurred, the input supply must \nreturn to the desired operating voltage window for at least \n32ms (tD(ON) ) in order to turn the external MOSFET back \non as illustrated in Figure\xa0 5 and Figure\xa0 6. For applications \nthat require faster turn-on after a fault, the LTC4367-1 \nprovides a 500µs GATE turn-on delay.\nGoing out of and then back into fault in less than t D(ON)  \nwill keep the MOSFET off continuously. Similarly, coming \nout of shutdown (SHDN low to high) triggers an 800µs \nstart-up delay timer (see Figure\xa011).\nThe GATE turn-on delay timer is also active while the part \nis powering up. The timer starts once V IN rises above \nVIN(UVLO)  and V IN lies within the user selectable UV/OV \npower good window. See Figure\xa09.\nShutdown\nThe SHDN input turns off the external MOSFETs in a \ncontrolled manner. When SHDN is asserted low, a 90µA \ncurrent sink slowly begins to turn off the external MOSFETs. \nOnce the voltage at the GATE pin falls below the voltage \nat the V OUT pin, the current sink is throttled back and a \nfeedback loop takes over.  This loop forces the GATE voltage \nto track V OUT, thus keeping the external MOSFETs off as \nVOUT decays. Note that when V OUT < 2.2V, the GATE pin \nis pulled to within 400mV of ground. \nWeak gate turn off reduces load current slew rates and \nmitigates voltage spikes due to parasitic inductances. To further decrease GATE pin slew rate, place a capacitor \nacross the gate and source terminals of the external MOS -\nFETs. The waveforms of Figure\xa0 10 were captured using \nthe Si7942 dual N-channel MOSFETs, and a 2A load with \n100µF output capacitor.

Figure\xa0 17 shows how the \nLTC4367-1 can protect a load from OV transients, while \nregulating the output voltage at a user-defined level. When \nthe output voltage reaches its OV limit, the LTC4367-1 \nturns off the external MOSFETs.

Figure\xa0 18 shows the waveforms for \nthe circuit of Figure\xa0 17. The voltage spikes on V IN result from the parasitic inductance of the V IN connector.

C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nNote that during initial start-up, the LTC4367-1 will not \nturn on the external MOSFETs until a battery is first con -\nnected to the V IN pin. To begin operation, V IN must initially \nrise above the 2.2V UVLO lockout voltage. Connecting the \nbattery ensures that the LTC4367-1 comes out of UVLO.\n12V Application with 150V T ransient Protection\nFigure\xa0 20 shows a 12V application that withstands input \nsupply transients up to 150V.  When the input voltage ex -\nceeds 17.9V, the OV resistive divider turns off the external \nMOSFETs. As V IN rises to 150V, the gate of transistor M1 \nremains in the Off condition, thus preventing conduction \nfrom V IN to V OUT. Note that M1 must have an operating \nrange above 150V.\nResistor R6 and diode D3 clamp the LTC4367 supply volt -\nage to 50V. To prevent R6 from interfering with reverse \noperation, the recommended value is 1k or less. Note that \nthe power handling capability of R6 must be considered in \norder to avoid overheating during transients. D3 is shown \nas a bidirectional clamp in order to achieve reverse-polarity \nprotection at V IN. M2 is also required in order to protect \nVOUT from negative voltages at V IN and should have an \noperating range beyond the breakdown of D3. If reverse \nprotection is not desired remove M2 and connect the \nsource of M1 directly to V OUT. \nMOSFET Selection\nTo protect against a negative voltage at V IN, the external \nN-channel MOSFETs must be configured in a back-to-\nback arrangement. Dual N-channel packages are thus the \nbest choice. The MOSFET is selected based on its power handling capability, drain and gate breakdown voltages, \nand threshold voltage. \nThe drain to source breakdown voltage must be higher \nthan the maximum voltage expected between V IN and V OUT. \nNote that if an application generates high energy transients \nduring normal operation or during hot swap, the external \nMOSFET must be able to withstand this transient voltage.\nDue to the high impedance nature of the charge pump \nthat drives the GATE pin, the total leakage on the GATE pin \nmust be kept low. The gate drive curves of Figure 3 were \nmeasured with a 1µA load on the GATE pin. Therefore, \nthe leakage on the GATE pin must be no greater than 1µA \nin order to match the curves of Figure\xa0 3. Higher leakage \ncurrents will result in lower gate drive. The dual N-channel \nMOSFETs shown in Table 1 all have a maximum gate leakage \ncurrent of 100nA. Additionally, Table 1 lists representative \nMOSFETs that would work at different values of V IN.\nLayout Considerations\nThe trace length between the V IN pin and the drain of the \nexternal MOSFET should be minimized, as well as the trace \nlength between the GATE pin of the LTC4367 and the gates \nof the external MOSFETs. \nPlace the bypass capacitors at V OUT as close as possible \nto the external MOSFET. Use high frequency ceramic \ncapacitors in addition to bulk capacitors to mitigate hot \nswap ringing. Place the high frequency capacitors closest \nto the MOSFET. Note that bulk capacitors mitigate ringing \nby virtue of their ESR. Ceramic capacitors have low ESR \nand can thus ring near their resonant frequency.\nFigure\xa020. 12V Application Protected from 150V T ransientsVIN\nUV\nOVSHDN\nD3: SMAJ43CA BI-DIRECTIONALOV = 17.9V\n4367 F20VOUT\nFAULTGATEVIN\n12VM1\nFDD2572M2\nFDS5680VOUT\nGNDLTC4367R4\n510kD3\nR2\n2050k\nR1\n59kR6\n1k\nLTC436719\nRev.
