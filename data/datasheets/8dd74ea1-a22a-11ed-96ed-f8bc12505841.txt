Operation with 3 MHz switching\nfrequency allows employing small size inductor andcapacitors. Input supply voltage feedforward control isemployed to deal with wide input voltage range.Synchronous rectification and automatic PWM/PFM power\nsave mode offer improved system efficiency.\nOperation Mode Selection (NCP6334C)\nFor NCP6334C with an external mode selection option,\nhigh level (above 1.1 V) at MODE pin forces the device tooperate in forced PWM mode. Low level (below 0.4 V) atthis pin enables the device to operate in automaticPFM/PWM mode for power saving function.\nPWM Mode Operation\nIn medium and heavy load range, the inductor current is\ncontinuous and the device operates in PWM mode with fixed\nswitching frequency, which has a typical value of 3 MHz. In\nthis mode, the output voltage is regulated by on −time pulse\nwidth modulation of an internal P −MOSFET. An internal\nN−MOSFET operates as synchronous rectifier and its\nturn−on signal is complimentary to that of the P −MOSFET.PFM Mode Operation\nIn light load range, the inductor current becomes\ndiscontinuous and the de vice automatical ly operates in PFM\nmode with an adaptive fixed on time and variable switching\nfrequency. In this mode, the output voltage is regulated bypulse frequency modulation of the internal P −MOSFET, and\nthe switching frequency is almost proportional to the\nloading current. The internal N −MOSFET operates as\nsynchronous rectifier after each on pulse of the P −MOSFET\nwith a very small negative current limit. When the loadincreases and the inductor current becomes continuous, the\ncontroller automatically turns back to the fixed −frequency\nPWM mode operation.\nUndervoltage Lockout\nThe input voltage VIN must reach or exceed 2.4 V\n(typical) before the NCP6334B/C enables the converteroutput to begin the start up sequence. The UVLO threshold\nhysteresis is typically 100 mV .\nEnable\nThe NCP6334B/C has an enable logic input pin EN. A\nhigh level (above 1.1 V) on this pin enables the device toactive mode. A low level (below 0.4 V) on this pin disables\nthe device and makes the device in shutdown mode. There\nis an internal filter with 5 /C0109s time constant. The EN pin is\npulled down by an internal 10 nA sink current source. In\nmost of applications, the EN signal can be programmedindependently to VIN power sequence.\nEN\nPGVout95%\n90%1.1V\n0.4V\n300us\n1.15ms 8us 5us 8us\nActive\nDischarge8us100us\nFigure 19. Power Good and Active Discharge Timing Diagram\nPower Good Output (NCP6334B)\nFor NCP6334B with a power good output, the device\nmonitors the output voltage and provides a power goodoutput signal at the PG pin. This pin is an open −drain output\npin. To indicate the output of the converter is established, apower good signal is available. The power good signal is low\nwhen EN is high but the output voltage has not beenestablished. Once the output voltage of the converter drops\nout below 90% of its regulation during operation, the power\ngood signal is pulled low and indicates a power failure. A 5%\nNCP6334B, NCP6334C\nwww. onsemi.com\n10hysteresis is required on power good comparator before\nsignal going high again.\nSoft−Start\nA soft start limits inrush current when the converter is\nenabled. After a minimum 300 /C0109s delay time following the\nenable signal, the output voltage starts to ramp up in 100 /C0109s\n(for external adjustable voltage devices) or with a typical10 V/ms slew rate (for fixed voltage devices).\nActive Output Discharge\nAn output discharge operation is active in when EN is low.\nA discharge resistor (500 /C0087 typical) is enabled in this\ncondition to discharge the output capacitor through SW pin.\nCycle−by−Cycle Current Limitation\nThe NCP6334B/C protects the device from over current\nwith a fixed −value cycle −by−cycle current limitation. Thetypical peak current limit ILMT is 2.8 A. If inductor current\nexceeds the current limit threshold, the P −MOSFET will be\nturned off cycle −by−cycle. The maximum output current\ncan be calculated by\nIMAX/C0043ILMT/C0042VOUT/C0064/C0466VIN/C0042VOUT/C0467\n2/C0064VIN/C0064fSW/C0064L(eq. 1)\nwhere VIN is input supply voltage, VOUT is output voltage,\nL is inductance of the filter inductor, and f SW is 3 MHz\nnormal switching frequency.\nThermal Shutdown\nThe NCP6334B/C has a thermal shutdown protection to\nprotect the device from overheating when the die\ntemperature exceeds 150 °C. After the thermal protection is\ntriggered, the fault state can be ended by re −applying VIN\nand/or EN when the temperature drops down below 125 °C.\nNCP6334B, NCP6334C\nwww. onsemi.com\n11APPLICATION INFORMATION\nOutput Filter Design Considerations\nThe output filter introduces a double pole in the system at\na frequency of\nfLC/C00431\n2/C0064/C0112/C0064L/C0064C/C0504(eq. 2)\nThe internal compensation network design of the\nNCP6334B/C is optimized for the typical output filter\ncomprised of a 1.0 /C0109H inductor and a 10 /C0109F ceramic output\ncapacitor, which has a double pole frequency at about\n50 kHz. Other possible output filter combinations may have\na double pole around 50 kHz to have optimum operationwith the typical feedback network. Normal selection range\nof the inductor is from 0.47 /C0109H to 4.7 /C0109H, and normal\nselection range of the output capacitor is from 4.7 /C0109F to\n22 /C0109F.\nInductor Selection\nThe inductance of the inductor is determined by given\npeak−to−peak ripple current IL_PP of approximately 20%to 50% of the maximum output current IOUT_MAX for a\ntrade−off between transient response and output ripple.

For\na given peak −to−peak ripple current IL_PP in the inductor\nof the output filter, the output voltage ripple across theoutput capacitor is the sum of three ripple components as\nbelow.\nVOUT_PP/C0091VOUT_PP(C)/C0041VOUT_PP(ESR)/C0041VOUT_PP(ESL)\n(eq. 5)\nwhere VOUT_PP(C) is a rip ple component by  an equivalent\ntotal capacitance of the output capacitors, VOUT_PP(ESR)\nis a ripple component by an equivalent ESR of the outputcapacitors, and VOUT_PP(ESL) is a ripple component by\nan equivalent ESL of the output capacitors. In PWMoperation mode, the three ripple components can be\nobtained by\nVOUT_PP(C)/C0043IL_PP\n8/C0064C/C0064fSW(eq. 6)\nVOUT_PP(ESR)/C0043IL_PP/C0064ESR (eq. 7)\nVOUT_PP(ESL)/C0043ESL\nESL/C0041L/C0064VIN(eq. 8)\nand the peak −to−peak ripple current is\nIL_PP/C0043/C0466VIN/C0042VOUT/C0467/C0064VOUT\nVIN/C0064fSW/C0064L(eq. 9)\nNCP6334B, NCP6334C\nwww. onsemi.com\n12In applications with all ceramic output capacitors, the\nmain ripple component of the output ripple isVOUT_PP(C). So that the minimum output capacitance can\nbe calculated regarding to a given output ripple requirement\nVOUT_PP in PWM operation mode.\nCMIN/C0043IL_PP\n8/C0064VOUT_PP/C0064fSW(eq. 10)\nInput Capacitor Selection\nOne of the input capacitor selection guides is the input\nvoltage ripple requirement. To minimize the input voltageripple and get better decoupling in the input power supplyrail, ceramic capacitor is recommended due to low ESR and\nESL. The minimum input capacitance regarding to the input\nripple voltage VIN_PP isCIN_MIN/C0043IOUT_MAX/C0064/C0466D/C0042D2/C0467\nVIN_PP/C0064fSW(eq. 11)\nwhere\nD/C0043VOUT\nVIN(eq. 12)\nIn addition, the input capacitor needs to be able to absorb\nthe input current, which has a RMS value of\nIIN_RMS/C0043IOUT_MAX/C0064D/C0042D2 /C0504(eq. 13)\nThe input capacitor also needs to be sufficient to protect\nthe device from over voltage spike, and normally at least a\n4.7 /C0109F capacitor is required. The input capacitor should be\nlocated as close as possible to the IC on PCB.\nTable 3.

The programmed output voltage is\nVOUT/C0043VFB/C0064/C04661/C0041R1\nR2/C0467 (eq. 14)\nwhere V FB is equal to the internal reference voltage 0.6 V ,\nR1 is the resistance from V OUT to FB, which has a normal\nvalue range from 50 k /C0087 to 1 M /C0087 and a typical value of220 k/C0087 for applications with the typical output filter. R2 is\nthe resistance from FB to AGND, which is used to programthe output voltage according to equation (14) once the value\nof R1 has been selected. A capacitor Cfb needs to be\nemployed between the V\nOUT and FB in order to provide\nfeedforward function to achieve optimum transientresponse. Normal value range of Cfb is from 0 to 100 pF, and\na typical value is 15 pF for applications with the typical\noutput filter and R1 = 220 k /C0087.\nTable 4 provides reference values of R1 and Cfb in case\nof different output filter combinations. The final design may\nneed to be fine tuned regarding to application specifications.\nTable 4.

Electricallayout guidelines are:\n•Use wide and short traces for power paths (such as\nPVIN, VOUT, SW, and PGND) to reduce parasitic\ninductance and high −frequency loop area. It is also\ngood for efficiency improvement.\n•The device should be well decoupled by input capacitor\nand input loop area should be as small as possible to\nreduce parasitic inductance, input voltage spike, andnoise emission.\n•SW node should be a large copper pour, but compact\nbecause it is also a noise source.\n•It would be good to have separated ground planes forPGND and AGND and connect the two planes at one\npoint. Directly connect AGND pin to the exposed pad\nand then connect to AGND ground plane through vias.Try best to avoid overlap of input ground loop and\noutput ground loop to prevent noise impact on output\nregulation.•Arrange a “quiet” path for output voltage sense and\nfeedback network, and make it surrounded by a ground\nplane.\nThermal Layout Considerations\nGood thermal layout helps high power dissipation from a\nsmall package with reduced temperature rise. Thermallayout guidelines are:\n•The exposed pad must be well soldered on the board.\n•A four or more layers PCB board with solid ground\nplanes is preferred for better heat dissipation.\n•More free vias are welcome to be around IC and/orunderneath the exposed pad to connect the inner ground\nlayers to reduce thermal impedance.\n•Use large area copper especially in top layer to help\nthermal conduction and radiation.\n•Do not put the inductor to be too close to the IC, thusthe heat sources are distributed.\nAVIN GND\nVOUT GNDCinCinÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏ\nÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎ\nÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎ\nL\nCoutCout\nO\nÏÏÏÏÏÏÎÎÎÎÎÎ\nÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏ\nÎÎÎÎÎÎÏÏÏÏÏÏ\nÎÎÎÎÎÎÏÏÏÏÏÏ2\n4 FBSW\n3 AGND7\n5 ENAVIN6 MODE/PG1 PGND 8 PVIN\nFO\nACfb\nR1\nR2P P P\nPP\nP\nAA\nF\nP P PP P PPP\nP\nFigure 20.
