Combining \nhigh speed CMOS and monolithic air core transformer technology, \nthese isolation components provide outstanding performance \ncharacteristics superior to alternatives, such as optocoupler devices. \niCoupler devices remove the design difficulties commonly \nassociated with optocouplers. Typical optocoupler concerns \nregarding uncertain current transfer ratios, nonlinear transfer functions, and temperature and lifetime effects are eliminated with the simple i Coupler digital interfaces and stable performance \ncharacteristics. The need for external drivers and other discrete components is eliminated with these iCoupler products. \nFurthermore, iCoupler devices consume one-tenth to one-sixth \nthe power of optocouplers at comparable signal data rates. \nThe ADuM3300 /ADuM3301 isolators provide three independent \nisolation channels in a variety of channel configurations and \ndata rates (see the Ordering Guide). All models operate with the \nsupply voltage on either side ranging from 3.3 V to 5.5 V , providing \ncompatibility with lower voltage systems as well as enabling a voltage translation functionality across the isolation barrier. The ADuM3300/ ADuM3301 isolators have a patented refresh feature \nthat ensures dc correctness in the absence of input logic \ntransitions and during power-up/power-down conditions. \nIn comparison to ADuM1300/ ADuM1301 isolators, ADuM3300 / \nADuM3301 isolators contain various circuit and layout changes \nto provide increased capability relative to system-level IEC 61000-4-x testing (ESD, burst, and surge). The precise capability in these tests for either the ADuM1300 /ADuM1301  or \nADuM3300/ ADuM3301 products is strongly determined by the \ndesign and layout of the user’s system. \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAMS \nENCODE DECODEENCODE DECODEENCODE DECODEVDD1\nGND1\nVIA\nVIB\nVIC\nNC\nNC\nGND1VDD2\nGND 2\nVOA\nVOB\nVOC\nNC\nVE2\nGND 21\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n05984-001\nFigure 1.\n ADuM3300  Functional Block Diagram DECODE ENCODEENCODE DECODEENCODE DECODEVDD1\nGND1\nVIA\nVIB\nVOC\nNC\nVE1\nGND 1VDD2\nGND2\nVOA\nVOB\nVIC\nNC\nVE2\nGND 21\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n05984-002\nFigure 2.\n ADuM3301  Functional Block Diagram \n1 Protected by U.S. Patents 5,952,849; 6,873,065; 6,903,578; and 7,075,329.  \nADuM3300/ADuM3301 Data Sheet  \nRev.

The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as describ ed in the Power Consumption  section. \nSee Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on per- channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through \nFigure 12 for total V DD1 and V DD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM3300/ ADuM3301 channel configurations.  \n2 The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n3 The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n4 tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ox signa l. t PLH propagation delay is \nmeasured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ox signal.  \n5 tPSK is the magnitude of the worst -case difference in t PHL or t PLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load \nwithin the recommended operating conditions.  \n6 Codirectional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays betwe en any two channels with inputs on the same side of \nthe isolation barrier. Opposing -directional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with \ninputs on opposing sides of the isolatio n barrier.  \n7 CM H is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining V O > 0.8 V DD2. CM L is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate \nthat can be sustained while maintaining V O < 0.8 V. The common -mode voltage slew rates app ly to both rising and falling common -mode voltage edges. The transient \nmagnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.  \n8 Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See  Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information \non per -channel supply current for unlo aded and loaded conditions.

See Figure 9 through \nFigure 12 for t otal VDD1 and V DD2 supply currents  as a function of data rate for ADuM3300/ ADuM3301 channel configurations.  \n2 The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n3 The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n4 tPHL propagation delay is meas ured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ox signal. t PLH propagation delay is \nmeasured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ox signal.  \n5 tPSK is the magnitude of the worst -case difference in t PHL or t PLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load \nwithin the recommended operating conditions.  \n6 Codirectional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of \nthe isolation barrier. Opposing -directional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation d elays between any two channels with \ninputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.  \n7 CM H is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining V O > 0.8 V DD2. CM L is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate \nthat can be su stained while maintaining V O < 0.8 V. The common -mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common -mode voltage edges. The transient \nmagnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.  \n8 Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information \non per -channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions.

Power supply \nbypassing is strongly recommended at the input and output \nsupply pins (see Figure 14). Bypass capacitors are most \nconveniently connected between Pin 1 and Pin 2 for V DD1 and \nbetween Pin 15 and Pin 16 for V DD2. The capacitor value should \nbe between 0.01 µF  and 0.1 µF. The total lead length between \nboth ends of the capacitor and the input power supply pin should not exceed 20  mm. Bypassing between Pin 1 and Pin 8 \nand between Pin 9 and Pin 16 should be considered unless the \nground pair on each package side is connected close to the package.  \nVDD1\nGND 1\nVIA\nVIB\nVIC/OC\nNC\nVE1\nGND 1VDD2\nGND 2\nVOA\nVOB\nVOC/IC\nNC\nVE2\nGND 2\n05984-015\nF\nigure 14. Recommended Printed Circuit Board Layout  \nIn applications involving high common -mode transients, care \nshould be taken to ensure that board coupling across the isolation barrier is minimized. Furthermore, the board layout should be designed such that any coupling that does occur \nequally affects all pins on a given component side. Failure to \nensure this could cause voltage differentials between pins exceeding the device’s  absolute maximum ra tings , thereby \nleading to latch -up or permanent damage.  \nSee the AN- 1109 Application Note  for board layout guidelines. \nSYSTEM -LEVEL  ESD CONSIDERATIONS A ND \nENHANCEMENTS  \nSystem -level ESD reliability (for example, per IEC 61000 -4-x) is \nhighly dependent on system design , which varies widely by \napplication. The ADuM330 0/ADuM3301 incorporate many \nenhancements to make ESD reliability less dependent on system \ndesign. The enhancements include  \n• ESD protection cells added to all input/output interfaces.\n• Key meta l trace resistances reduced using wider geometry\nand paralleling of lines with vias.\n• The SCR effect inherent in CMOS devices minimized by\nuse of guarding and isolation technique between PMOSand NMOS devices.\n• Areas of high electric field concentration eliminated using\n45° corners on metal traces.\n• Supply pin overvoltage prevented with larger ESD clampsbetween each supply pin and its respective ground.While the ADuM330 0/ADuM3301 improve system -level ESD \nreliability, they are no substitute for a robust system -level \ndesign. See Application Note AN -793 ESD/Latch -Up \nConsiderations with iCoupler Isolation Products  for detailed \nrecommendations on board layout and system -level design. \nPROPAGATION DELAY -RELATED PARAMETERS  \nPropagation delay is a parameter that describes the time it take s \na logic signal to propagate through a component. The propagation \ndelay to a logic low output can differ from the propagation delay to a logic high. \nINPUT (V IX)\nOUTPUT (V OX)tPLH tPHL\n50%50%\n05984-016\nF\nigure 15. Propagation Delay Parameters  \nPulse width  distortion is the maximum d ifference between \nthese two propagation delay values and is an indication of how accurately the input signal’s timing is preserved.  \nChannel -to-channel matching refers to the maximum amount \nthe propagation delay differs between channels within a single ADuM330 0/ADuM3301 component.  \nPropagation delay skew refers to the maximum amount the propagation delay differs between m ultiple ADuM330 0/ \nADuM3301 components operating under the same conditions.  \nDC CORRECTNESS AND M AGNETIC FIELD IMMUNI TY \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input cause narrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the transformer. The decoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In th e absence of \nlogic transitions at the input for more than ~1 µs, a periodic set \nof refresh pulses indicativ e of the correct input state is  sent to \nensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal pulses of more than about 5 µs, the input side is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctional, in which case the isolator output is forced to a default state (see Table 11) by the \nwatchdog timer circuit.  \nThe limitation on the ADuM3300 /ADuM3301 magnetic field \nimmunity is set by the condition in which induced voltage in the \ntransformer’s receiving coil is sufficiently large to either falsely \nset or reset the decoder. The following analysis defines the \nconditions under which this can occur. The 3 V operating condition of the ADuM330 0/ADuM3301 are  examined because \nit represents the most susceptibl e mode of operation.  \nADuM3300/ADuM3301 Data Sheet  \nRev. E | Page 18 of 20 The pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater \nthan 1.0  V . The decoder has a sensing threshold at about 0.5 V , thus \nestablishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can be tolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is given by  \nV = (−dβ/dt) \n∑π r n2; n = 1, 2, … , N \nwhere:  \nβ is magnetic flux density (gauss). \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm).  \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil. \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM330x and an imposed requirement that the induced voltage is  at most \n50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable magnetic field is calculated as shown in Figure 16.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kgauss)\n0.001\n1M10\n0.01\n1k 10k 10M0.11\n100M 100k\n05984-017\nF\nigure 16. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density  \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the sensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. Similarly, if such an event were to occur during a transmitted \npulse (and was of the worst -case polarity), it woul d reduce the \nreceived pulse from >1.0  V to 0.75 V— still well above the 0.5 V \nsensing threshold of the decoder.  \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to \nspecific current magnitudes at given distances from the ADuM330 0/ADuM3301 transformers. Figure 17 expresses these \nallowable current magnitudes as a function of frequency for \nselected distances. The ADuM330 0/ADuM3301 are extremely \nimmu ne and can be affected only by extremely large currents \noperated at high frequency very close to the component (see Figure 17). For the 1 MHz example noted, a 0.5 kA current \nwould have to be placed 5 mm away from the ADuM330 0/ \nADuM3301 to affect the component’s operation.

Maximum Allowable Current  \nfor Various Current -to- ADuM3300 /ADuM3301 Spacing s \nNote that at c ombinations of strong magnetic field and high \nfrequency, any loops formed by printed circuit board traces could induce error voltages sufficiently large enough to trigger the thresholds of succeeding circuitry. Care should be taken in the layout of such tr aces to avoid this possibility.  \nPOWER CONSUMPTION  \nThe supply current at a given channel of the ADuM330 0/ \nADuM3301 isolator is a function of the supply voltage, the \nchannel’s data rate, and the channel’s output load.  \nFor each input channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDI = I DDI (Q) f ≤ 0.5 f r \nIDDI = IDDI (D)  × (2f − fr) + I DDI (Q) f > 0.5 f r \nFor each output channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDO = I DDO (Q) f ≤ 0.5 f r \nIDDO = (IDDO (D) + (0.5 × 10−3) × CL × V DDO) × (2 f − f r) + I DDO (Q) \nf > 0.5 f r \nwhere:  \nIDDI (D) , IDDO (D)  are the input and output dynamic supply currents \nper channel (mA/Mbps).   \nCL is the output load capacitance (pF).   \nVDDO is the output supply voltage (V).   \nf is the input logic signal frequency (MHz); it is half of the input \ndata rate expressed in units of Mbps.   \nfr is the input stage refresh rate (Mbps).   \nIDDI (Q) , IDDO (Q)  are the specified input and output quiescent \nsupply currents (mA).  \nTo calculate the total I DD1 and I DD2 supply current, the supply \ncurrents for each input and output channel corresponding to \nVDD1 and V DD2 are calculated and totaled. Figure 6 provides per -\nchannel input supply curr ent as a function of data rate. Figure 7 \nand Figure 8 provide per -channel output supply current as a \nfunction of data rate for an unloaded output condition and for a \n15 pF output condition, respectively. Figur e 9 through Figure 12 \nprovide tot al V DD1 and V DD2 supply current as a function of data \nrate for ADuM3300/ ADuM3301 channel configurations.  \nData Sheet  ADuM3300/ADuM3301 \nRev. E | Page 19 of 20 INSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected  \nto voltage stress over a sufficiently long period . The rate of \ninsulation degradation is depende nt on the characteristics of the \nvoltage waveform applied across the insulation.  In addition to \nthe testing performed by the regul atory agencies, Analog \nDevice s executes  an extensive set of evaluations to determine \nthe lifetime of the insulation structure within the ADuM330 0/ \nADuM3301. \nAnalog Devices performs accelerated life testing using voltage \nlevels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. \nAcceleration factors for several operating conditions are determined. T hese factors allow calculation of  the time to \nfailure at the actual working voltage .  \nThe values shown in Table 10 summarize the peak voltage for \n50 years of service life for a bipolar ac operating condition, and the maximum CSA/VDE approved working voltages. In many \ncases, the approved working voltage is higher than 50- year \nservice life voltage. Operation at these high working voltages can lead to shortened insulation life. \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADuM330 0/ADuM3301 depends \non the voltage waveform type imposed across the isolation \nbarrier. The i Coupler insulation structure  degr ades at different \nrates  depending on whether the waveform is bipolar ac, \nunipolar ac, or dc. Figure 18, Figure 19, and Figure 20 illustrate \nthese different isolation voltage waveforms.  \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment.  The goal \nof a 50 -year operating lifetime under the ac bipolar condition \ndetermines the Analog Devices  recommended maximum \nworking voltage.  I\nn the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insula -\ntion is significantly lower. This allows operation at higher working  \nvoltages while still achieving a 50 -year service life. The working \nvoltages listed in Table 10 can b e applied  while maintaining the \n50-year minimum lifetime , provided that the voltage conforms \nto either the unipolar ac  or dc voltage cases. Any cross -insulation  \nvoltage waveform that does not conform to Figure 19 or Figure 20 \nshould be treated as a bipolar ac waveform, and its peak volt age \nshould be limited to the 50 -year lifetime voltage value listed in  \nTable 10. Note that the voltage presented in Figure 19 is shown as \nsinusoidal for illustration purposes only. It is meant to represent \nany voltage waveform varying between 0 V and some limiting value. The limiting value can be positive or negative, but the \nvoltage cannot cross 0 V . \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n05984-020\nF\nigure 18.
