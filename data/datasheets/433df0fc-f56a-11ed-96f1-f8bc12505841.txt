The A input/output pin is designed to track V CCA \nwhile the B input/output tracks V CCB. This arrangement allows for \nuniversal low -voltage translation between any v oltages from 1. 2V to \n3.6V. The Direction pin (DIR) controls the direction of the transceiver \nand in a logic voltage related to V CCA. When a high logic level is \napplied to DIR the A pin becomes an in put and the B pin becomes the \noutput. Conversely the roles of A and B are reversed when DIR is \nasserted low.  \n \nThe tri-state feature occurs when either of the power supply voltages \nare zero. This is also an Ioff feature and allows for the output to \nremain i n a high- impedance state with both power supplies at 0V \npreventing damaging backflow currents and providing power down \nelectrical isolation up to 3.6 V as not to interfere with any logic activity \non pin A or B.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFeatures  \n• Wide Supply Voltage Range:  \n\uf0a7 VCC(A): from 1. 2V to 3.6 V \n\uf0a7 VCC(B): from 1.2V to 3.6V \n• ± 12mA Output Drive at 3.3V  \n• High Noise Immunity —(100mV Hysteresis Typical)  \n• IOFF Supports Partial -Power -Down Mode Operation \n• IOFF Controlled by Either V CC at 0V  \n• Inputs Accept up to 4.6V \n• ESD Protection Exceeds JESD 22  \n\uf0a7 200-V Machine Model (A115)  \n\uf0a7 2000- V Human Body Model (A114)  \n\uf0a7 1000 V Charged Device Model ( C101)  \n• Latch- Up Exceeds 100mA per JESD 78, Class I  \n• X2-DFN1409- 6 Package Designed as a D irect Replacement for \nChip-Scale Packaging.  \n• Totally Lead -Free & Fully RoHS Compliant (Notes 1 & 2)  \n• Halogen and Antimony Free. “Green” Device (Note 3)  \n \n  Pin Assignments  \n \nX2-DFN1410-6\nX2-DFN1409-6\nChip Scale\nAlternativeA\nGNDB\nDIR\nVcc(A) Vcc(B) 1 654 3\n2(Bottom View )B\nSOT26(Top View )\nGND\nA 4 321 6 Vcc(A)\n5Vcc(B)\nDIR\nX2-DFN0910-6X1-DFN1010-61(Top View )\nAGND\nBDIRVcc(A) Vcc(B)\n2\n356\n4 SOT363\n \n \n \nApplications  \n• Voltage Level Translation  \nWell Suited to J oin Logic Types Operating at D ifferent Voltages  \n• Power Down Signal Isolation  \nIf Either Voltage Domain is Turned off the Signal is Isolated and \nThere is no Loading on Signal Lines  \n• Wide Array of Products , such as:  \n\uf0a7 Cell Phones, Tablets, E -Readers  \n\uf0a7 PCs, Notebooks, Netbooks, Ultrabooks  \n\uf0a7 Networking, Routers, Gateways  \n\uf0a7 Computer Peripherals, Hard Drives, CD/DVD ROM s \n\uf0a7 TVs, DVD s, DVR s, Set Top Boxes \n\uf0a7 Personal Navigation/GPS  \n\uf0a7 MP3 players,  Cameras, Video Recorders  \n \n \n \nNotes:  1.

### Component Summary: 74AVC1T45DW-7

**Description:**
The 74AVC1T45 is a single-bit dual supply translating transceiver with tri-state outputs. It is designed for transmitting a single logic bit across different voltage domains, allowing for low-voltage translation between any voltages from 1.2V to 3.6V. The device features a direction control pin (DIR) that determines the data flow direction between the A and B pins. When DIR is high, the A pin acts as an input and the B pin as an output, and vice versa when DIR is low. The tri-state feature allows the outputs to remain in a high-impedance state when either power supply is turned off, preventing backflow currents.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - VCC(A): 1.2V to 3.6V
  - VCC(B): 1.2V to 3.6V
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Drive: ±12mA at 3.3V
  - IO Continuous Output Current: ±50mA
- **Power Consumption:**
  - Supply Current (ICCA + ICCB): 20 µA (typical)
- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Junction Temperature (TJ): -40°C to +150°C
  - Storage Temperature (TSTG): -65°C to +150°C
- **Package Type:**
  - SOT363 (DW package code)
- **Special Features:**
  - High noise immunity (100mV hysteresis typical)
  - IOFF supports partial-power-down mode operation
  - ESD protection exceeds JESD 22 standards
  - Lead-free and fully RoHS compliant
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level 1 per JEDEC J-STD-020E

**Typical Applications:**
The 74AVC1T45 is well-suited for applications requiring voltage level translation, particularly in systems where different logic levels must communicate. Typical applications include:
- Mobile devices such as cell phones, tablets, and e-readers
- Computers including PCs, notebooks, and ultrabooks
- Networking equipment like routers and gateways
- Consumer electronics such as TVs, DVD players, and set-top boxes
- Personal navigation devices and cameras

This component is ideal for scenarios where signal isolation is necessary during power-down conditions, ensuring that there is no loading on signal lines when either voltage domain is turned off.
