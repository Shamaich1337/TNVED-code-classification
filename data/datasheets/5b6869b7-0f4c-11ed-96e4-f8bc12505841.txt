The relative match of two \nresistors sets any gain from 1 to 1000. The AD8237 has excellent gain accuracy performance  that can be preserved at any gain \nwith two ratio -matched resistors. \nThe AD8237 employs the indirect  current feedback architecture to \nachieve a true rail -to-rail capability. Unlike conventional in -amps,  \nthe AD8237  can fully amplify signals with common- mode voltage \nat or even slightly beyond its supplies. This enables applications with high common -mode voltages to use smaller supplies and \nsave power.  \nThe AD8237 is an excellent choice for portable systems. With a \nminimum supply voltage of 1.8 V , a 115 µA typical supply current , \nand wide input range, the AD8237 makes full use of a li mited \npower budget, yet offer s bandwidth and drift performance  suitable \nfor bench -top systems.  The AD8237 is available in an 8 -lead MSOP package. Performance  \nis specified over the full temperature range of −40° C to +125°C.  \n6\n5\n4\n321\n–10\n0 1 2 3 4 5INPUT COMMON-MODE VOLTAGE (V)\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE (V)TRADITIONAL IN-AMP\n(RAIL-TO-RAIL OUT)AD8237\n10289-002G = 100\nVS = 5V\nVREF = 2.5V\n \nFigure 2.

Simplified Schematic  \n \nARCHITECTURE  \nThe AD8237 is based on an indirect current  feedback topology \nconsisting of three amplifiers: two matched transconductance \namplifiers that convert voltage to current , and one transimpedance  \namplifier , TIA,  that converts current to voltage. \nTo understand how the AD8237 works, first consider only the internal in- amp. A ssume a positive differential voltage is applied \nacro ss the inputs  of the transconductance amplifier , g\nm1. This input  \nvoltage is converted i nto a  differential  current , I1, by the gm. \nInitially, I2 is zero ; therefore,  I1 is fed into the TIA, causing the \noutput  to increase. If there is feedback from the output of the TI A \nto the negative terminal of gm2, and the positive terminal is held  \nconstant , the increasing output of the TI A cause s I2, as shown , to \nincrease.  When it is  assume d that  the TIA has infinite gain, the \nloop is satisfied when I2 equals I1 . Because the gain of gm1 and gm2 are \nmatched, this means that the differe ntial input voltage across gm1 \nappear s across the inputs of gm2. This behavioral model is all that \nis needed for proper operation of the AD8237, and the rest of the \ncircuit is for performance optimization.  \nThe AD8237 employs a novel adaptive level shift ( ALS ) technique. \nThis switched capacitor method shifts the common -mode level of \nthe input signal to the optimal level for the in -amp while preserving  \nthe differential signal. Once this is accomplished, additional performance benefits c an be ac hieved by using the internal in -amp to \ncompare +IN to FB and − IN to REF. This is  only  practical  because  \nthe signals emitting from  the ALS blocks are all referred to the \nsame common -mode potential.  \nIn traditional instrumentation amplifiers, the inpu t common -\nmode voltage can limit the available output swing, typically depicted  \nin a hexagon plot  of the input common -mode vs. the output voltage . \nBecause of this limit, very few instrumentation amplifiers can measure small signals near either supply rail. Using the indirect \ncurrent feedback topology and ALS, t he AD8237 achieve s a truly \nrail-to-rail characteristic. This increases power efficiency in many \napplications by allowing for power  supply reduction.  \n \n The AD8237 includes an RFI filter to remove  high frequency out-\nof-band signals without affecting  input impedance and CMRR over  \nfrequency. Additionally, there is a  bandwidth  mode pin to adjust the  \ncompensation. For ga ins greater than or equal to 10, the bandwidth  \nmode pin (BW) can be tied to +V\nS to change the com pensation \nand increase the gain  bandwidth product of the amplifier to 1 MHz.  \nOtherwise , connect BW to −VS for a 200 kHz gain  bandwidth \nproduct.  \nSETTING THE GAIN  \nThere are several ways to configure the AD8237. The transfer \nfunction of the AD8237 in the configuration in Figure 65 is  \nVOUT = G(V+IN − V−IN) + VREF \nwhere:  \nR1R21+ = G  \nTable 7. Suggested Resistors for Various Gains (1% Resistors) \nR1 (kΩ)  R2 (kΩ)  Gain  \nNone  Short  1.00  \n49.9  49.9  2.00  \n20 80.6  5.03 \n10 90.9  10.09  \n5 95.3  20.06  \n2 97.6  49.8 \n1 100 101 \n1 200 201 \n1 499 500 \n1 1000 1001  \nWhe reas the ratio of R2 to R1 sets the gain, the designer determines  \nthe absolute value of the resistors. Larger values reduce power \nconsumption and output loading; smaller values limit the FB input \nbias current and input impedance error s. If the parallel combination \nof R1 and R2 is greater than about 30  kΩ, the resistors start to \ncontribute to the noise . For best output swing and linearity , keep \n(R1 + R2) || RL ≥ 10 kΩ.  \n \n \nData Sheet  AD8237 \n \nRev. 0 | Page 21 of 28 The bias current at the FB pin is dependent on the common -mode \nand differential input impedance. FB bias current errors from the \ncommo n-mode input impedance can be reduced by placing a resistor  \nvalue of R1||R2 in series with the REF terminal, as shown in \nFigure 66. At higher gains, this resistor can simply be the same \nvalue as R1.  \nAD8237+IN\n–IN REFFBVOUT\nG = 1 +R2\nR1IB+\nIB–\nVREFR1 R2R1||R2+\n–IBRIBF\n10289-068 \nFigure 66. Cancelling Error from FB Input Bias Current  \nSome  applications may be able to take advantage of the symmetry of \nthe input transconductance amplifiers  by canceling the differential \ninput impedance errors , as shown in Figure 67. If the source resistance  \nis well known, setting the parallel combination of R1 and R2 equal to  \nRS accomplishes this.  If practical resistor values force the parallel \ncombination of R1 and R2 to be less than RS, add a series resistor \nto th e FB input to make up for the difference.  \nAD8237 +IN\n–IN REFFBVOUT\nR1 R2VINRS\nRINRIN\nIF R1||R2 = RS,\nVOUT = VIN × (1 +R2\nR1)V+IN= VIN×RIN\nRS+ RIN\n10289-069 \nFigure 67. Canceling Input Impedance Errors  \nGAIN ACCURACY  \nUnlike most instrumentation amplifiers, the relative match of the \ntwo gain  setting resistors determines the gain accuracy of the AD8237 \nrather than a single external resistor. For example, if two resistors have \nexactly the same absolute error, there is no error in gain. Conversely, two 1% resistors can cause approximately 2% maximum gain error \nat high gains. Temperature coefficient mismatch of the gain setting  \nresistors increases the gain drift of  the instrumentation amplifier \ncircuit  according to the gain equation . Because  these external resistors  \ndo not have to match any on -chip resistor s, resistors with good TC R \ntracking can achieve excellent gain drift  without the need  for a low \nabsolute TCR . \n \n \n For the best performance, keep the two input pairs (+IN and −IN, \nand FB and REF)  at similar dc and ac common -mode potentials . This  \nhas two bene fits. For dc common -mode, this minimizes the  gain \nerror of the AD8237. F or ac common -mode, this yie lds improved \nfrequency response. There is a maximum rate at which the ALS circuit can shift the common -mode  voltage, which is shown in \nFigure 27. Because of this limit, the best large signal frequency \nresponse is achieved when the ac common -mode  voltage  of the two  \ninput pairs  are matched.  For example, if the negative input i s at \na fixed voltage and the positive input is driven with a signal, the \nfeedback input moves with the positive input; therefore, the ac \ncommon -mode  voltage of the two input pairs is the same.  The \neffect  of this  is shown in Figure 25 and Figure 26. \nCLOCK FEEDTHROUGH  \nThe AD8237 uses nonoverlapping clocks to perform the chopping \nand ALS functions. The input voltage -to-current ampli fiers are \nchopped at approximately 27 kHz.   \nAlthough there is internal ripple -suppression circuitry, trace \namounts of these clock frequencies and their harmonics can be observed at the output in some configurations. These ripples  are \ntypically 100  µV RTI  when the bandwidth is greater than the clock \nfrequency. T hey can be larger after a transient  pulse  but settle back \nto nominal , which is included in the settling time specifications . \nThe amount of feedthrough at the output is dependent upon the gain and band width mode. The worst case is in high bandwidth \nmode when the gain can be almost 40 before the clock ripple is outside the bandwidth of the amplifier. For some applications, it may be necessary to use additional filtering after the AD8237 to \nremove this ripple.  \nINPUT VOLTAGE RANGE  \nThe allow able input range of the AD8237 is much simpler than \ntraditional architectures. For the transfer function of the AD8237 to \nbe valid, the input voltage must  follow two rules  \n• Keep the differential input voltage within  the limits shown in \nFigure 14; approximately  ±(Total Supply Voltage – 1.2 )  V. \n• Keep  the voltage of the inputs (including the REF and FB pins ) \nand the output with in the specified voltage range, which are \napproximately the supply rails . \nBecause the output swing is completely independent of the input common -mode voltage, there are no he xagonal figures or complicated  \nformulas to follow, and no limitation for the output swing the amplifier has for input signals with changing common  mode.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAD8237 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 22 of 28 INPUT PROTECTION  \nIf no external protection is used, keep the inputs of the AD8237 \nwithin the voltages specified in the absolute maximum ratings.  If the  \napplication requires voltages beyond these ratings, input protection  \nresistors can be placed in series with the inputs of the AD8237 to \nlimit the current to 5 mA. For example, if +VS is 3 V and a 10 V \noverload voltage can occur at the inputs, place a protection resistor  of \nat least (10  V − 3 V)/5 mA = 1.4 kΩ in series with the inputs.  \nAD8237RPROTECT\nRPROTECTV+IN+\n–\nV–IN+\n–+VS\n–VSPOSITIVE VOLTAGE PROTECTION:\nRPROTECT  >VIN– +VS\n5mA\nNEGATIVE VOLTAGE PROTECTION:\nRPROTECT  >–VS– VIN\n5mA\n10289-070 \nFigure 68.

Adding E xtra RFI F iltering   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  USING  THE REFERENCE PIN \nIn general, in strumentation amplifier reference pins can be useful \nfor a few reasons. They provide a means of physically separating the  \ninput and output grounds to reject ground bounce common to the \ninputs. They can also be used to precisely level shift the output signal . \nIn the configuration shown in Figure 65 through  Figure 67, the gain \nof the  reference pin to the output is  unity , as is common in a typical  \nin-amp. Because  the reference pin is functionally  no different from \nthe positive input , it can be used with gain , as shown in Figure 70.  \nThis configuration can be very useful in certain cases, such as dc \nremoval servo loops , which typically u se an inverting integrator  to \ndrive REF and compensate for a dc offset . This requires special \nattention  to the input  range  (especially at REF ) and the output range . \nAll three input voltages are referred  to the one ground shown , which \nmay need to be a low  impedance midsupply .  \nAD8237+IN\n–IN REFFBVOUT\nR2R1\nVOUT = (VREF + V+IN – V–IN) (1 +R2\nR1)\n10289-072 \nFigure 70. Applying Gain to the Reference Voltage \nTraditional instrumentation amplifier architectures require the reference pin to be driven with a low impedance source.  In these  \ntraditional  architectures, impedance at the reference pin degrades \nboth CMRR  and gain accuracy.

Using Voltage Divider to Set Reference Volta ge \nLAYOUT \nCommon -Mode Rejection Ratio over Frequency  \nPoor layout can cause some of the common -mode signal to be \nconverted to a differential signal before reaching the in -amp. This  \nconversion can occur when the path to the positive input pin has \na different  frequency response than the path to the negative input \npin. For best CMRR vs. frequency performance, closely match  the \nimpedance of each path . Place additional source resistance in the \ninput path (for example, for input protection) close to the in -amp \ninputs to minimize interaction between the resistors and the  parasitic \ncapacitance from  the printed circuit board (PCB) traces.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n Power Supplies  \nUse a  stable dc voltage to power the instrumentation  amplifier. \nNoise  on the supply pins can adversely affec t perform ance. For \nmore information,  see the PSRR performance curves in  Figure 17 \nthrough Figure 20. \nPlace a  0.1 µF capacitor as close as possible to each supply pin. \nAs shown in Figure 73, a 10 µF tantalum capacitor can be used farther  \naway from the part. This  capacitor, which is intended to be effective  at \nlow frequencies , can usually be shared by other precision integrated \ncircuits. Keep the traces between these integrated circuits short to \nminimize interaction of the trace parasitic inductance  with the shared  \ncapacitor. If a single supply is used, decoupling capacitors at −VS \ncan be omitted.   \nR1 R2AD8237+VS\n+IN\n–IN0.1µF 10µF\n0.1µF 10µF\n–VSVOUT\n10289-075REFFB\n \nFigure 73.

Battery -Powered Current Sense  \n \n \n \n PROGRAMMABLE GAIN IN -AMP  \nMost integrated circuit instrumentation amplifiers use a single \nresistor to set the gain, which is in a low impedance path. Any \ncomponent placed between the gain  setting pins has cu rrent flowing  \nthrough it, which adds to the gain resistance . Typical CMOS switches  \nhave on  resistance, RON. RON is not well controlled, is nonlinear with \ninput voltage, and has high drift. This creates large gain errors  and \ndistortion  at the output of the in-amp. This RON problem has made \nit difficult to build a precision programmable  gain in- amp in the \npast. With the AD8237 topology, the switches can be placed in a high \nimpedance  sense path, eliminating the para sitic resistance effects. \nFigure 76 shows one way to accomplish programmable gain. Some \napplications  may benefit from using a digi tal potentiometer  instead \nof a multiplexer.   \nAD8237+IN\n–IN470pFVOUT\nFB\n10289-07820kΩ\nADG604200Ω\n4:1 MUX2kΩ\n200Ω\n22.1ΩG = 10\nG = 100\nG = 1000REF2kΩ\nG = 1\n \nFigure 76. Programmable Gain  with a Multiplexer  \n \n \n \nAD8237 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 26 of 28 AD8237 IN AN ECG FRONT E ND \nElectrocardiogram ( ECG ) circuits must operate with a differential \ndc offset due to the half -cell potential of the electrodes . The tolerance  \nfor this over  potential is typically ± 300 mV; however,  it can be a volt  \nor more in some situations.  As ECG  circuits move to lower supply \nvoltages, the half -cell potential problem becomes more difficult , \nstrictly  limiting the gain that can be applied in the first st age. The \nAD8237 architecture provides a unique solution to this problem. \nIf the REF pin is left unconnected to the gain setting  network, a \nlow frequency inverting integrator can be connected from the output  \nto the REF pin. Because the AD8237 applies gain to the integrator \noutput, the integrator  only has to swing as far as the  dc offset  to \ncompensate for it, rather than the dc offset multiplied by the gain. With this sy stem architecture, large gains can be applied  at the in- amp \nstage, and the requirements of the rest of the system can be greatly \nreduced. This also reduces noise and offset error contributions from  \ndevices after the in -amp in the signal path.  The circuit i n Figure 77 \nillustrate s the core concept. Additional op amps  can be added for \nimproved performance, such as input b uffering, filtering, and driven \nlead, if  it is required by the system.
