Pin Description\nThe descriptions of the pins are listed in Table 2-1 .\nTable 2-1.\u2000Pin Function Table\nName 8-Lead SOIC 8-Lead TSSOP 8-Pad UDFN(1)8-Ball VFBGA Function\nCS 1 1 1 1 Chip Select\nSO 2 2 2 2 Serial Data Output\nWP(2)3 3 3 3 Write-Protect\nGND 4 4 4 4 Ground\nSI 5 5 5 5 Serial Data Input\nSCK 6 6 6 6 Serial Data Clock\nHOLD(2)7 7 7 7 Suspends Serial Input\nVCC 8 8 8 8 Device Power Supply\nNote:\u2000\n1. The exposed pad on this package can be connected to GND or left floating.\n2. The Write-Protect ( WP) and Hold ( HOLD) pins should be driven high or low as appropriate.\n2.1 Chip Select ( CS)\nThe AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B is selected when the Chip Select ( CS) pin is low. When the device is not\nselected, data will not be accepted via the Serial Data Input (SI) pin, and the Serial Output (SO) pin will remain in\na high ‑impedance state.\nTo ensure robust operation, the CS pin should follow V CC upon power-up. It is therefore recommended to connect CS\nto V CC using a pull-up resistor (less than or equal to 10 kΩ). After power-up, a low level on CS is required prior to any\nsequence being initiated.\n2.2 Serial Data Output (SO)\nThe Serial Data Output (SO) pin is used to transfer data out of the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B. During a read\nsequence, data is shifted out on this pin after the falling edge of the Serial Data Clock (SCK).\n2.3 Write-Protect ( WP)\nThe Write-Protect ( WP) pin will allow normal read/write operations when held high. When the WP pin is brought low,\nall write operations are inhibited. WP going low while CS is still low will interrupt a write operation. If the internal write\ncycle has already been initiated, WP going low will have no effect on any write operation.\n2.4 Ground (GND)\nThe ground reference for the Device Power Supply (V CC). The Ground (GND) pin should be connected to the system\nground.\n2.5 Serial Data Input (SI)\nThe Serial Data Input (SI) pin is used to transfer data into the device. It receives instructions, addresses and data.\nData is latched on the rising edge of the Serial Data Clock (SCK). AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nPin Description\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS20006251A-page 5\n2.6 Serial Data Clock (SCK)\nThe Serial Data Clock (SCK) pin is used to synchronize the communication between a master and the AT25010B/\nAT25020B/AT25040B. Instructions, addresses or data present on the Serial Data Input (SI) pin is latched in on the\nrising edge of SCK, while output on the Serial Data Output (SO) pin is clocked out on the falling edge of SCK.\n2.7 Suspend Serial Input ( HOLD)\nThe Suspend Serial Input ( HOLD) pin is used in conjunction with the Chip Select ( CS) pin to pause the AT25010B/\nAT25020B/AT25040B. When the device is selected and a serial sequence is underway, HOLD can be used to pause\nthe serial communication with the master device without resetting the serial sequence. To pause, the HOLD pin must\nbe brought low while the Serial Data Clock (SCK) pin is low. To resume serial communication, the HOLD pin is\nbrought high while the SCK pin is low (SCK may still toggle during HOLD). Inputs to the Serial Data Input (SI) pin will\nbe ignored while the Serial Data Output (SO) pin will be in the high ‑impedance state.\n2.8 Device Power Supply (V CC)\nThe Device Power Supply (V CC) pin is used to supply the source voltage to the device. Operations at invalid V CC\nvoltages may produce spurious results and should not be attempted. AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nPin Description\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS20006251A-page 6\n3.

Upon power-up, the device will not\nrespond to any instructions until the V CC level crosses the internal voltage threshold (V POR) that brings the device out\nof Reset and into Standby mode.\nThe system designer must ensure the instructions are not sent to the device until the V CC supply has reached a\nstable value greater than or equal to the minimum V CC level. Additionally, once the V CC is greater than or equal to the\nminimum V CC level, the bus master must wait at least t PUP before sending the first instruction to the device. See Table\n4-4 for the values associated with these power-up parameters.\nTable 4-4.\u2000Power-Up Conditions(1)\nSymbol Parameter Min. Max.

These parameters are characterized but they are not 100% tested in production.\nIf an event occurs in the system where the V CC level supplied to the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B drops below\nthe maximum V POR level specified, it is recommended that a full-power cycle sequence be performed by first driving AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nElectrical Characteristics\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.

Performance is determined through characterization and the qualification process.\n4.6.4 Software Reset\nThe SPI interface of the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B can be reset by toggling the CS input. If the CS line is\nalready in the Active state, it must complete a transition from the Inactive state (≥V IH) to the Active state (≤V IL) and\nthen back to the Inactive state (≥V IH) without sending clocks on the SCK line. Upon completion of this sequence, the\ndevice will be ready to receive a new opcode on the SI line.\n4.6.5 Device Default State at Power-Up\nThe AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B default state upon power-up consists of:\n• Standby Power mode\n• A high-to-low-level transition on CS is required to enter Active state\n• Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the STATUS register = 0\n•Ready/Busy bit in the STATUS register = 0, indicating the device is ready to accept a new command\n• Device is not selected\n• Not in Hold condition\n• BP1 and BP0 bits in the STATUS register are unchanged from their previous state due to the fact that they are\nnonvolatile values\n4.6.6 Device Default Condition\nThe AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B is shipped from Microchip to the customer with the EEPROM array set to an all\nFFh data pattern (logic ‘ 1’ state). The Block Write ‑Protect bits in the STATUS register are set to logic ‘ 0’. AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nElectrical Characteristics\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS20006251A-page 13\n5. Device Operation\nThe AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B is controlled by a set of instructions that are sent from a host controller,\ncommonly referred to as the SPI Master. The SPI Master communicates with the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B via\nthe SPI bus which is comprised of four signal lines: Chip Select ( CS), Serial Data Clock (SCK), Serial Data Input (SI)\nand Serial Data Output (SO).\nThe SPI protocol defines a total of four modes of operation (Mode 0, 1, 2 or 3) with each mode differing in respect to\nthe SCK polarity and phase and how the polarity and phase control the flow of data on the SPI bus. The AT25010B/\nAT25020B/AT25040B supports the two most common modes, SPI Modes 0 and 3. With SPI Modes 0 and 3, data is\nalways latched in on the rising edge of SCK and always output on the falling edge of SCK. The only difference\nbetween SPI Modes 0 and 3 is the polarity of the SCK signal when in the inactive state (when the SPI Master is in\nStandby mode and not transferring any data). SPI Mode 0 is defined as a low SCK while CS is not asserted (at V CC)\nand SPI Mode 3 has SCK high in the inactive state. The SCK Idle state must match when the CS is deasserted both\nbefore and after the communication sequence in SPI Mode 0 and 3. The figures in this document depict Mode 0 with\na solid line on SCK while CS is inactive and Mode 3 with a dotted line.\nFigure 5-1.\u2000SPI Mode 0 and Mode 3\nSOSISCKCS\nMSB LSB\nMSB LSBMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\n5.1 Interfacing the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B on the SPI Bus\nCommunication to and from the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B must be initiated by the SPI Master device, such as\na microcontroller. The SPI Master device must generate the serial clock for the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B on\nthe Serial Data Clock (SCK) pin. The AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B always operates as a slave due to the fact that\nthe SCK is always an input.\n5.1.1 Selecting the Device\nThe AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B is selected when the Chip Select ( CS) pin is low. When the device is not\nselected, data will not be accepted via the Serial Data Input (SI) pin, and the Serial Data Output (SO) pin will remain\nin a high ‑impedance state.\n5.1.2 Sending Data to the Device\nThe AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B uses the SI pin to receive information. All instructions, addresses and data\ninput bytes are clocked into the device with the Most Significant bit (MSb) first. The SI pin samples on the first rising\nedge of the SCK line after the CS has been asserted.\n5.1.3 Receiving Data from the Device\nData output from the device is transmitted on the SO pin, with the MSb output first. The SO data is latched on the first\nfalling edge of SCK after the instruction has been clocked into the device, such as the Read from Memory Array\n(READ ) and Read STATUS Register ( RDSR ) instructions. See Read Sequence  for more details. AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nDevice Operation\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS20006251A-page 14\n5.2 Device Opcodes\n5.2.1 Serial Opcode\nAfter the device is selected by driving CS low, the first byte will be received on the SI pin. This byte contains the\nopcode that defines the operation to be performed. Refer to Table 6-1  for a list of all opcodes that the AT25010B/\nAT25020B/AT25040B will respond to.\n5.2.2 Invalid Opcode\nIf an invalid opcode is received, no data will be shifted into AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B and the SO pin will\nremain in a high ‑impedance state until the falling edge of CS is detected again. This will reinitialize the serial\ncommunication.\n5.3 Hold Function\nThe Suspend Serial Input ( HOLD) pin is used to pause the serial communication with the device without having to\nstop or reset the clock sequence. The Hold mode, however, does not have an effect on the internal write cycle.\nTherefore, if a write cycle is in progress, asserting the HOLD pin will not pause the operation and the write cycle will\ncontinue to completion.\nThe Hold mode can only be entered while the CS pin is asserted. The Hold mode is activated by asserting the HOLD\npin during the SCK low pulse. If the HOLD pin is asserted during the SCK high pulse, then the Hold mode will not be\nstarted until the beginning of the next SCK low pulse. The device will remain in the Hold mode as long as the HOLD\npin and CS pin are asserted.\nWhile in Hold mode, the SO pin will be in a high-impedance state. In addition, both the SI pin and the SCK pin will be\nignored. The Write-Protect ( WP) pin, however, can still be asserted or deasserted while in the Hold mode.\nTo end the Hold mode and resume serial communication, the HOLD pin must be deasserted during the SCK low\npulse. If the HOLD pin is deasserted during the SCK high pulse, then the Hold mode will not end until the beginning\nof the next SCK low pulse.\nIf the CS pin is deasserted while the HOLD pin is still asserted, then any operation that may have been started will be\naborted and the device will reset the WEL bit in the STATUS register back to the logic ‘ 0’ state.\nFigure 5-2.\u2000Hold Mode\nHOLDSCKCS\nHold Hold Hold AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nDevice Operation\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.

When the WP pin is brought\nlow, all write operations are inhibited. The WP pin going low while CS is still low will interrupt a write operation. If the\ninternal write cycle has already been initiated, WP going low will have no effect on any write operation. AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nDevice Operation\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS20006251A-page 16\n6. Device Commands and Addressing\nThe AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B is designed to interface directly with the synchronous Serial Peripheral\nInterface (SPI). The AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B utilizes an 8 ‑bit instruction register. The list of instructions and\ntheir operation codes are contained in Table 6-1 . All instructions, addresses and data are transferred with the MSb\nfirst and start with a high ‑to ‑low CS transition.\nTable 6-1.\u2000Instruction Set for the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nInstruction Name Instruction Format Operates On Operation Description\nWREN 0000 X110 STATUS Register Set Write Enable Latch (WEL)\nWRDI 0000 X100 STATUS Register Reset Write Enable Latch (WEL)\nRDSR 0000 X101 STATUS Register Read STATUS Register\nWRSR 0000 X001 STATUS Register Write STATUS Register\nREAD 0000 A011 Memory Array Read from Memory Array\nWRITE 0000 A010 Memory Array Write to Memory Array\nNote:\u2000\n1. “A” represents the MSb address bit (A 8) for the AT25040B and a “don't care” bit for the AT25010B and\nAT25020B.\n6.1 STATUS Register Bit Definition and Function\nThe AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B includes an 8 ‑bit STATUS register. The STATUS register bits modulate various\nfeatures of the device as shown in Table 6-2  and Table 6-3 . These bits can be changed by specific instructions that\nare detailed in the following sections.\nTable 6-2.\u2000STATUS Register Format\nBit 7 Bit 6 Bit 5 Bit 4 Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0\nX X X X BP1 BP0 WEL RDY/BSY\nTable 6-3.\u2000STATUS Register Bit Definition\nBit Name Type Description\n7:4 RFU Reserved for Future Use R 0Reads as zeros when the device is not in a write cycle\n1Reads as ones when the device is in a write cycle\n3:2 BP1\nBP0Block Write Protection R/W 00No array write protection (Factory Default)\n01Quarter array write protection (see Table 6-4 )\n10Half array write protection (see Table 6-4 )\n11Entire array write protection (see Table 6-4 )\n1 WEL Write Enable Latch R 0Device is not write enabled (Power-up Default)\n1Device is write enabled\n0RDY/BSY Ready/Busy Status R 0Device is ready for a new sequence\n1Device is busy with an internal operation AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nDevice Commands and Addressing\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS20006251A-page 17\n6.2 Read STATUS Register ( RDSR )\nThe Read STATUS Register ( RDSR ) instruction provides access to the STATUS register. The ready/busy and write\nenable status of the device can be determined by the RDSR  instruction. Similarly, the Block Write-Protect (BP1, BP0)\nbits indicate the extent of memory array protection employed. The STATUS register is read by asserting the CS pin,\nfollowed by sending in a 05h opcode on the SI pin. Upon completion of the opcode, the device will return the 8 ‑bit\nSTATUS register value on the SO pin.\nFigure 6-1.\u2000RDSR Waveform\nSOSCKCS\n0  1   2   3    4    5     6      7       8       9        10       11       12       13       14       15\nSTATUS Register Data Out\nHigh-ImpedanceSI\nMSBRDSR Opcode (05h)\n0  0   0   0    0    1     0      1\nMSBD7      D6      D5      D4       D3      D2       D1      D0\n6.3 Write Enable ( WREN ) and Write Disable ( WRDI )\nEnabling and disabling writing to the STATUS register and EEPROM array is accomplished through the Write Enable\n(WREN ) instruction and the Write Disable ( WRDI ) instruction. These functions change the status of the WEL bit in the\nSTATUS register.\n6.3.1 Write Enable Instruction ( WREN )\nThe Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit of the STATUS register must be set to a logic ‘ 1’ prior to each Write STATUS\nRegister ( WRSR ) and Write to Memory Array ( WRITE ) instructions. This is accomplished by sending a WREN  (06h)\ninstruction to the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B. First, the CS pin is driven low to select the device and then a\nWREN  instruction is clocked in on the SI pin. Then the CS pin can be driven high and the WEL bit will be updated in\nthe STATUS register to a logic ‘ 1’. The device will power ‑up in the Write Disable state (WEL = 0). The WP pin must\nbe held high during a WREN  instruction. AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nDevice Commands and Addressing\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.

The WRDI  instruction is independent of the status of the WP\npin.\nFigure 6-3.\u2000WRDI Timing\nSOSCKCS\nHigh-ImpedanceSI\nMSBWRDI Opcode (04h)\n0  0  0  0   0   1   0    00  1   2   3    4    5     6      7\n6.4 Write STATUS Register ( WRSR )\nThe Write STATUS Register ( WRSR ) instruction enables the SPI Master to change selected bits of the STATUS\nregister. Before a WRSR  instruction can be initiated, a WREN  instruction must be executed to set the WEL bit to\nlogic ‘ 1’. Upon completion of a WREN  instruction, a WRSR  instruction can be executed.\nNote:\u2000  The WRSR  instruction has no effect on bit 7, bit 6, bit 5, bit 4, bit 1 and bit 0 of the STATUS register. Only bit 3\nand bit 2 can be changed via the WRSR  instruction. These modifiable bits are the Block Protect (BP1, BP0) bits.\nThese bits are nonvolatile bits that have the same properties and functions as regular EEPROM cells. Their values\nare retained while power is removed from the device.\nThe AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B will not respond to commands other than a RDSR  after a WRSR  instruction until\nthe self ‑timed internal write cycle has completed. When the write cycle is completed, the WEL bit in the STATUS\nregister is reset to logic ‘ 0’. AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nDevice Commands and Addressing\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.

This instruction initiates a self-timed internal write cycle (t WC) on the rising edge of CS after a valid sequence.\n6.4.1 Block Write-Protect Function\nThe WRSR  instruction allows the user to select one of four possible combinations as to how the memory array will be\ninhibited from writing through changing the Block Write-Protect bits (BP1, BP0). The four levels of array protection\nare:\n• None of the memory array is protected.\n• Upper quarter (¼) address range is write-protected meaning the highest order address bits are read-only.\n• Upper half (½) address range is write-protected meaning the highest order address bits are read-only.\n• All of the memory array is write-protected meaning all address bits are read-only.\nThe Block Write Protection levels and corresponding STATUS register control bits are shown in Table 6-4 .\nTable 6-4.\u2000Block Write-Protect Bits\nLevel STATUS Register Bits Write-Protected/Read ‑Only Address Range\nBP1 BP0 AT25010B AT25020B AT25040B\n0 0 0 None None None\n1(1/4) 0 1 60h-7Fh C0h-FFh 180h-1FFh\n2(1/2) 1 0 40h-7Fh 80h-FFh 100h-1FFh\n3(All) 1 1 00h-7Fh 00h-FFh 000h-1FFh AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nDevice Commands and Addressing\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS20006251A-page 20\n7. Read Sequence\nReading the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B via the SO pin requires the following sequence. After the CS line is\npulled low to select a device, the READ  (03h) instruction (including A 8 for the AT25040B) is transmitted via the SI line\nfollowed by the 8 ‑bit address to be read (A 7 - A0). Refer to Table 7-1  for the address bits for AT25010B/AT25020B/\nAT25040B.\nTable 7-1.\u2000AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B Address Bits\nAddress AT25010B AT25020B AT25040B\nAN A6-A0 A7-A0 A8-A0\nDon’t Care Bits A7 None None\nUpon completion of the 8 ‑bit address, any data on the SI line will be ignored. The data (D 7 ‑D0) at the specified\naddress is then shifted out onto the SO line. If only one byte is to be read, the CS line should be driven high after the\ndata comes out. The read sequence can be continued since the byte address is automatically incremented and data\nwill continue to be shifted out. When the highest ‑order address bit is reached, the address counter will rollover to the\nlowest ‑order address bit allowing the entire memory to be read in one continuous read cycle regardless of the starting\naddress.\nFigure 7-1.\u2000Read Waveform\nSOSISCK\nMSB MSB23 10\n00000A(1)1167 54 1011 98 12 2122 17 201918 1516 1314 2324   25\nREAD Opcode (03h)\nAAAA AAA\nMSB MSBDDDDDDDD DDAddress Bits A7-A0\nData Byte 1\nHigh-ImpedanceCS\nA\nNote:\u2000\n1. “A” represents the MSb address bit (A 8) for the AT25040B and a “don’t care” bit for the AT25010B and\nAT25020B.

Write Sequence\nIn order to program the AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B, two separate instructions must be executed. First, the\ndevice must be write enabled  via the Write Enable ( WREN ) instruction. Then, one of the two possible write sequences\ndescribed in this section may be executed.\nNote:\u2000  If the WP pin is brought low or the device is not Write Enabled ( WREN ), the device will ignore the WRITE\ninstruction and will return to the standby state when CS is brought high. A new CS assertion is required to re-initiate\ncommunication.\nThe address of the memory location(s) to be programmed must be outside the protected address field location\nselected by the block write protection level. During an internal write cycle, all commands will be ignored except the\nRDSR  instruction. Refer to Table 8-1  for the address bits for AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B.\nTable 8-1.\u2000AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B Address Bits\nAddress AT25010B AT25020B AT25040B\nAN A6-A0 A7-A0 A8-A0\nDon’t Care Bits A7 None None\n8.1 Byte Write\nA byte write requires the following sequence and is depicted in Figure 8-1 . After the CS line is pulled low to select the\ndevice, the WRITE  (02h) instruction (including A 8 for the AT25040B) is transmitted via the SI line followed by the 8 ‑bit\naddress and the data (D7 ‑D0) to be programmed. Programming will start after the CS pin is brought high. The\nlow ‑to ‑high transition of the CS pin must occur during the SCK low time (Mode 0) and SCK high time (Mode 3)\nimmediately after clocking in the D0 (LSB) data bit. The AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B is automatically returned to\nthe Write Disable state (STATUS register bit WEL = 0) at the completion of a write cycle.\nFigure 8-1.\u2000Byte Write\nSOSISCKCS\nMSB MSB23 10\n00000A(2)1067 54 1011 98 12 23 2122 17 201918 1516 1314\nWRITE Opcode (02h)\nHigh-ImpedanceAAAA AA AA\nMSBD7D6D5D4D3D2D1D0Address Bits A7-A0Data IntWC(1)\nNote:\u2000\n1.

Partial page writes of less than 8 bytes are allowed. After each byte of data is\nreceived, the three lowest order address bits are internally incremented following the receipt of each data byte. The\nhigher order address bits are not incremented and retain the memory array page location. If more bytes of data are\ntransmitted than will fit to the end of that memory row, the address counter will rollover to the beginning of the same\nrow. Nevertheless, creating a rollover event should be avoided as previously loaded data in the page could become AT25010B/AT25020B/AT25040B\nWrite Sequence\n© 2019 Microchip Technology Inc.

This method allows the application to know immediately when the write cycle has\ncompleted to start a subsequent operation.\nOnce the internally-timed write cycle has started, a polling routine can be initiated. This involves repeatedly sending\nRead STATUS Register ( RDSR ) instruction to determine if the device has completed its self-timed internal write cycle.\nIf the RDY/BSY bit (bit 0 of STATUS register) = 1, the write cycle is still in progress. If bit 0 = 0, the write cycle has\nended. If the RDY/BSY bit = 1, repeated RDSR  commands can be executed until the RDY/BSY bit = 0, signaling that\nthe device is ready to execute a new instruction. Only the Read STATUS Register ( RDSR ) instruction is enabled\nduring the write cycle.\nFigure 8-3.\u2000Polling Flowchart\nSend Valid \nWrite \nProtocolDeassert\nCS to VCC to \nInitiate a\nWrite CycleSend RDSR\nInstruction\nto the DeviceContinue to \nNext Operation\nNOYESDoes\nRDY/BSY\n= 0?
