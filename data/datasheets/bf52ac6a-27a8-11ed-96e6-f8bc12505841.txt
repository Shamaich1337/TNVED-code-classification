Both devices operate \nfrom +3V to +16.5V input and generate -500mV to  \n-200V output. To minimize switching noise, both devices \nfeature a current-mode, constant-frequency PWM control \nscheme. The operating frequency can be set from 100kHz \nto 500kHz through a resistor.\nThe MAX1846 is available in an ultra-compact 10-pin \nµMAX ® package. Operation at high frequency, com -\npatibility with ceramic capacitors, and inverting topol -\nogy without transformers allow for a compact design. \nCompatibility with electrolytic capacitors and flexibility to \noperate down to 100kHz allow users to minimize the cost \nof external components. The high-current output drivers \nare designed to drive a P-channel MOSFET and allow the \nconverter to deliver up to 30W.\nThe MAX1847 features clock synchronization and shut -\ndown functions. The MAX1847 can also be configured to \noperate as an inverting flyback controller with an N-channel \nMOSFET and a transformer to deliver up to 70W. The \nMAX1847 is available in a 16-pin QSOP package.\nCurrent-mode control simplifies compensation and  \nprovides good transient response. Accurate current-mode \ncontrol and over current protection are achieved through \nlow-side current sensing.\nApplications\n ●Cellular Base Stations\n ●Networking Equipment\n ●Optical Networking Equipment\n ●SLIC Supplies\n ●CO DSL Line Driver Supplies\n ●Industrial Power Supplies\n ●Servers \n ●VOIP SuppliesFeatures\n ●90% Efficiency\n ●+3.0V to +16.5V Input Range \n ●-500mV to -200V Output \n ●Drives High-Side P- Channel MOSFET\n ●100kHz to 500kHz Switching Frequency\n ●Current-Mode, PWM Control\n ●Internal Soft-Start\n ●Electrolytic or Ceramic Output Capacitor\n ●The MAX1847 also offers:  \n Synchronization to External Clock Shutdown  \n N-Channel Inverting Flyback Option\nµMAX is a registered trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.Pin Configurations  appear at end of data sheet.\n19-2091; Rev 4; 7/16+Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.PART TEMP RANGE PIN-PACKAGE\nMAX1846 EUB -40°C to +85°C 10 µMAX\nMAX1846EUB+ -40°C to +105 °C 10 µMAX\nMAX1847 EEE -40°C to +85°C 16 QSOP\nMAX1847EEE+ -40°C to +85°C 16 QSOP\nMAX1846\nMAX1847VL IN\nCOMP\nFREQ\nREF\nGNDFBPGNDCSEXTPPOSITIVE\nVIN\nNEGATIVE\nVOUT\nMAX1846/MAX1847 High-Efficiency, Current-Mode,  \nInverting PWM Controller\n  Typical Operating CircuitOrdering Information\nEVALUATION KIT AVAILABLE\nIN, SHDN  to GND  ................................................. -0.3V to +20V\nPGND to GND  ...................................................... -0.3V to +0.3V\nVL to PGND for VIN ≤ 5.7V  ........................ -0.3V to (V IN + 0.3V)\nVL to PGND for VIN > 5.7V  ..................................... -0.3V to +6V\nEXT to PGND  ............................................. -0.3V to (V IN + 0.3V)\nREF, COMP to GND  .................................... -0.3V to (VL + 0.3V)\nCS, FB, FREQ, POL, SYNC to GND  ...................... -0.3V to +6VContinuous Power Dissipation (T A = +70°C)\n 10-Pin µMAX (derate 5.6mW/°C above +70°C)  .......... 444mW\n 16-Pin QSOP (derate 8.3mW/°C above +70°C) .......... 696mW\nOperating Temperature Range  ......................... -40°C to +105°C\nJunction Temperature  ...................................................... +150°C\nStorage Temperature Range  ............................ -65°C to +150°C\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s)  ................................. +300°C\nSoldering Temperature (reflow)\n Lead(Pb)-free ............................................................... +260°C\n Containing lead(Pb)  ..................................................... +240°C\n(VSHDN  = V IN = +12V, SYNC = GND, PGND = GND, R FREQ  = 147kΩ ±1%, C VL = 0.47µF, C REF = 0.1µF, TA = 0°C to +85°C , \nunless otherwise noted.)\nPARAMETER CONDITIONS MIN TYP MAX UNITS\nPWM CONTROLLER\nOperating Input Voltage Range 3.0 16.5 V\nUVLO ThresholdVIN rising-40°C to ~+85°C 2.8 2.95\nV -40°C to ~+105°C 2.8 2.96\nVIN falling-40°C to ~+85°C 2.6 2.74\n-40°C to ~+105°C 2.59 2.74\nUVLO Hysteresis 60 mV\nFB Threshold No load -12 0 12 mV\nFB Input Current VFB = -0.1V -50 -6 50 nA\nLoad RegulationCCOMP  = 0.068µF, V OUT = -48V, \nIOUT = 20mA to 200mA (Note 1)-1 0 %\nLine RegulationCCOMP  = 0.068µF, V OUT = -48V, \nVIN = +8V to +16.5V, I OUT = 100mA0.04 %\nCurrent-Limit Threshold 85 100 115 mV\nCS Input Current CS = GND 10 20 µA\nSupply Current VFB = -0.1V, V IN = +3.0V to +16.5V 0.75 1.2 mA\nShutdown Supply CurrentSHDN = GND, V IN = +3.0V to +16.5V\nVIN = +3.0V to +16.5V10 25 µA\nREFERENCE AND VL REGULATOR\nREF Output Voltage IREF = 50µA 1.236 1.25 1.264 V\nREF Load Regulation IREF = 0 to 500µA -2 -15 mV\nVL Output Voltage IVL = 100µA 3.85 4.25 4.65 V\nVL Load Regulation IVL = 0.1mA to 2.0mA -20 -60 mV\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 2\nMAX1846/MAX1847 High-Efficiency, Current-Mode,  \nInverting PWM ControllerElectrical CharacteristicsStresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device.

Features include \nshutdown, adjustable internal operating frequency or \nsynchronization to an external clock, soft-start, adjustable \ncurrent limit, and a wide (+3V to +16.5V) input range.\nPWM Controller\nThe architecture of the MAX1846/MAX1847 current-mode \nPWM controller is a BiCMOS multi-input system that \nsimultaneously processes the output-error signal, the \ncurrent-sense signal, and a slope-compensation ramp \n(Functional Diagram ). Slope compensation prevents sub -\nharmonic oscillation, a potential result in current-mode \nregulators operating at greater than 50% duty cycle. The \ncontroller uses fixed-frequency, current-mode operation \nwhere the duty ratio is set by the input-to-output voltage \nratio. The current-mode feedback loop regulates peak \ninductor current as a function of the output error signal. \nInternal Regulator\nThe MAX1846/MAX1847 incorporate an internal low-  \ndropout regulator (LDO). This LDO has a 4.25V output \nand powers all MAX1846/MAX1847 functions (excluding \nEXT) for the primary purpose of stabilizing the perfor -\nmance of the IC over a wide input voltage range (+3V to \n+16.5V). The input to this regulator is connected to IN, \nand the dropout voltage is typically 100mV, so that when \nVIN is less than 4.35V, VL is typically V IN minus 100mV. \nWhen the LDO is in dropout, the MAX1846/MAX1847 still \noperate with V IN as low as 3V. For best performance, it is \nrecommended to connect VL to IN when the input supply \nis less than 4.5V.\nUndervoltage Lockout\nThe MAX1846/MAX1847 have an undervoltage lockout \ncircuit that monitors the voltage at VL. If VL falls below \nthe UVLO threshold (2.8V typ), the control logic turns \nthe P-channel FET off (EXT high impedance). The rest \nof the IC circuitry is still powered and operating. When \nVL increases to 60mV above the UVLO threshold, the IC \nresumes operation from a start up condition (soft-start).\nSoft-Start\nThe MAX1846/MAX1847 feature a “digital” soft-start \nthat is preset and requires no external capacitor. Upon \nstartup, the FB threshold decrements from the refer -\nence voltage to 0 in 64 steps over 1024 cycles of f OSC \nor fSYNC . See the Typical Operating Characteristics for \na scope picture of the soft-start operation. Soft-start is \nimplemented: 1) when power is first applied to the IC,  2) when exiting shutdown with power already applied, and \n3) when exiting undervoltage lockout.\nShutdown (MAX1847 only)\nThe MAX1847 shuts down to reduce the supply current \nto 10µA when SHDN  is low. In this mode, the internal  \nreference, error amplifier, comparators, and biasing  \ncircuitry turn off. The EXT output becomes high imped -\nance and the external pullup resistor connected to EXT \npulls V EXT to V IN, turning off the P-channel MOSFET. \nWhen in shutdown mode, the converter's output goes to 0.\nFrequency Synchronization  \n(MAX1847 only)\nThe MAX1847 is capable of synchronizing its switching \nfrequency with an external clock source. Drive SYNC \nwith a logic-level clock input signal to synchronize the \nMAX1847. A switching cycle starts on the rising edge \nof the signal applied to SYNC. Note that the frequen -\ncy of the signal applied to SYNC must be higher than \nthe default frequency set by R FREQ . This frequency \nis required so that the internal clock does not start a \nswitching cycle prematurely. If SYNC is inactive for an \nentire clock cycle of the internal oscillator, the internal \noscillator takes over the switching operation. Choose  \nRFREQ  such that f OSC = 0.9 5 f SYNC .\nEXT Polarity (MAX1847 only)\nThe MAX1847 features an option to utilize an N-channel \nMOSFET configuration, rather than the typical p-channel \nMOSFET configuration (Figure 1). In order to drive the \ndifferent polarities of these MOSFETs, the MAX1847 \nis capable of reversing the phase of EXT by 180 \ndegrees. When driving a P-channel MOSFET, connect  \nPOL to GND. When driving an n-channel MOSFET, \nconnect POL to VL. These POL connections ensure the \nproper polarity for EXT. For design guidance in regard to \nthis application, refer to the MAX1856 data sheet.\nDesign Procedure\nInitial Specifications\nIn order to start the design procedure, a few parameters \nmust be identified: the minimum input voltage expect -\ned (V IN(MIN) ), the maximum input voltage expected \n(VIN(MAX) ), the desired output voltage (V OUT), and the \nexpected maximum load current (I LOAD ).\nCalculate the Equivalent Load Resistance\nThis is a simple calculation used to shorten the verifica -\ntion equations:\nRLOAD  = VOUT / ILOAD\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 11\nMAX1846/MAX1847 High-Efficiency, Current-Mode,  \nInverting PWM Controller\nCalculate the Duty Cycle\nThe duty cycle is the ratio of the on-time of the MOSFET \nswitch to the oscillator period. It is determined by the \nratio of the input voltage to the output voltage. Since \nthe input voltage typically has a range of operation, a \nminimum (D MIN) and maximum (D MAX) duty cycle is \ncalculated by:\nOUT DMIN\nIN(MAX) SW LIM OUT DVVDV VVV V−\n−−+=−+\nOUT DMAX\nIN(MIN) SW LIM OUT DVVDV VVV V−\n−−−+=+\nwhere V D is the forward drop across the output diode, \nVSW is the drop across the external FET when on, \nand V LIM is the current-limit threshold. To begin with,  \nassume V D = 0.5V for a Schottky diode, V SW = 100mV, \nand V LIM = 100mV. Remember that V OUT is negative \nwhen using this formula.\nSetting the Output Voltage\nThe output voltage is set using two external resistors to \nform a resistive-divider to FB between the output and \nREF (refer to R1 and R2 in Figure 1). V REF is nominally  1.25V and the regulation voltage for FB is nominally 0. \nThe load presented to the reference by the feedback \nresistors must be less than 500µA to guarantee that \nVREF is in regulation (see Electrical Characteristics \nTable ). Conversely, the current through the feedback \nresistors must be large enough so that the leakage  \ncurrent of the FB input (50nA) is insignificant. Therefore, \nselect R2 so that I R2 is between 50µA and 250µA.\nIR2 = VREF / R2\nwhere V REF = 1.25V. A typical value for R2 is 10k W.\nOnce R2 is selected, calculate R1 with the following \nequation:\nR1 = R2 x (-V OUT / VREF)\nSetting the Operating Frequency\nThe MAX1846/MAX1847 are capable of operating at \nswitching frequencies from 100kHz to 500kHz. Choice \nof operating frequency depends on a number of factors:\n1) Noise considerations may dictate setting (or  \nsynchronizing) f OSC above or below a certain  \nfrequency or band of frequencies, particularly in RF  \napplications.Figure 1.

Calculate the maximum oscillator \nfrequency with the following formula: \nIN(MIN) SW LIM\nOSC(MAX)\nIN(MIN) SW LIM OUT D\nOFF(MIN)V VV\nfV VVV V\n1                 t−−\n−−−=+\n×\nRemember that V OUT is negative when using this formula.  \nWhen running at the maximum oscillator frequency \n(fOSCILLATOR ) and maximum duty cycle (D MAX), do \nnot exceed the minimum value of D MAX stated in the \nElectrical Characteristics  table. For designs that exceed \nthe D MAX and f OSC(MAX) , an autotransformer can reduce \nthe duty cycle and allow higher operating frequencies.\nThe oscillator frequency is set by a resistor, RFREQ, \nwhich is connected from FREQ to GND. The relation -\nship between fOSC (in Hz) and RFREQ (in W) is slightly  \nnonlinear, as illustrated in the Typical Operating \nCharacteristics. Choose the resistor value from the graph \nand check the oscillator frequency using the following \nformula:\n()()()()2 7 11 19OSC\n FREQ FREQ1f\n5.21 10   1.92 10   R 4.86 10   R−− −−=\uf8ee\uf8f9× +× × × ×\uf8ef\uf8fa\uf8f0\uf8fb\nExternal Synchronization (MAX1847 only)\nThe SYNC input provides external-clock synchroniza -\ntion (if desired). When SYNC is driven with an exter -\nnal clock, the frequency of the clock directly sets the \nMAX1847's switching frequency. A rising clock edge on \nSYNC is interpreted as a synchronization input. If the \nsync signal is lost, the internal oscillator takes over at \nthe end of the last cycle, and the frequency is returnedto the rate set by R FREQ . Choose R FREQ  such that \nfOSC = 0.9 x f SYNC .\nChoosing Inductance Value\nThe inductance value determines the operation of the \ncurrent-mode regulator. Except for low-current applica -\ntions, most circuits are more efficient and economical \noperating in continuous mode, which refers to continu -\nous current in the inductor. In continuous mode there is \na trade-off between efficiency and transient response. \nHigher inductance means lower inductor ripple current, \nlower peak current, lower switching losses, and, there -\nfore, higher efficiency. Lower inductance means higher \ninductor ripple current and faster transient response. A \nreasonable compromise is to choose the ratio of inductor \nripple current to average continuous current at mini -\nmum duty cycle to be 0.4. Calculate the inductor ripple  \nwith the following formula:\n( )\n( )RIPPLE\nLOAD(MAX) IN(MAX) SW LIM OUT D\nIN(MAX) SW LIMI\n0.4  I V V V V V\nV VV−−−\n−−=\n×× +\nThen calculate an inductance value:\nL = (V IN(MAX)  / IRIPPLE ) x (D MIN / fOSC)\nChoose the closest standard value. Once again, remem -\nber that V OUT is negative when using this formula.\nDetermining Peak Inductor Current\nThe peak inductor current required for a particular output \nis:\nILPEAK  = ILDC + (ILPP / 2)\nwhere I LDC is the average DC inductor current and I LPP \nis the inductor peak-to-peak ripple current. The I LDC and \nILPP terms are determined as follows:\n()\n()( )LOADLDC\nMAX\nSW LIM MAX IN MIN\nLPP\nOSCII1 D\nV   V   V  x D\nIL x f=−\n−−\n=\nwhere L is the selected inductance value. The  \nsaturation rating of the selected inductor should meet \nor exceed the calculated value for I LPEAK , although \nmost coil types can be operated up to 20% over their \nsaturation rating without difficulty. In addition to the sat -\nuration criteria, the inductor should have as low a series  \nresistance as possible. For continuous inductor current, \nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 13\nMAX1846/MAX1847 High-Efficiency, Current-Mode,  \nInverting PWM Controller\nthe power loss in the inductor resistance (PLR) is \napproximated by:\n2\nLOADLR L\nMAXIP ~R xI  D\uf8eb\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8f7−\uf8ed\uf8f8\nwhere R L is the inductor series resistance.\nOnce the peak inductor current is calculated, the  \ncurrent sense resistor, R CS, is determined by:\nRCS = 85mV / I LPEAK\nFor high peak inductor currents (>1A), Kelvin-sensing \nconnections should be used to connect CS and PGND \nto RCS. Connect PGND and GND together at the ground \nside of R CS. A lowpass filter between R CS and CS may \nbe required to prevent switching noise from tripping the \ncurrent-sense comparator at heavy loads. Connect a \n100W resistor between CS and the high side of R CS, and \nconnect a 1000pF capacitor between CS and GND.\nChecking Slope-Compensation Stability\nIn a current-mode regulator, the cycle-by-cycle  \nstability is dependent on slope compensation to prevent  \nsubharmonic oscillation at duty cycles greater than \n50%. For the MAX1846/MAX1847, the internal slope \ncompensation is optimized for a minimum inductor value \n(LMIN) with respect to duty cycle. For duty cycles greater \nthen 50%, check stability by calculating LMIN using the  \nfollowing equation:\n( )\n( )()MIN IN(MIN) CS S\nMAX MAXL V xR /M\n        x 2xD 1 / 1 D −−\uf8ee\uf8f9=\uf8f0\uf8fb\n\uf8ee\uf8f9\uf8f0\uf8fb\nwhere V IN(MIN)  is the minimum expected input voltage, \nMs is the Slope Compensation Ramp (41 mV/µs) and \nDMAX is the maximum expected duty cycle. If L MIN is \nlarger than L, increase the value of L to the next standard \nvalue that is larger than L MIN to ensure slope compensa -\ntion stability.\nChoosing the Inductor Core\nChoosing the most cost-effective inductor usually requires \noptimizing the field and flux with size. With higher output \nvoltages the inductor may require many turns, and this \ncan drive the cost up. Choosing an inductor value at L MIN \ncan provide a good solution if discontinuous inductor  \ncurrent can be tolerated. Powdered iron cores can pro -\nvide the most economical solution but are larger in size \nthan ferrite.Power MOSFET Selection\nThe MAX1846/MAX1847 drive a wide variety of P-channel \npower MOSFETs (PFETs). The best performance,  \nespecially with input voltages below 5V, is achieved with \nlow-threshold PFETs that specify on-resistance with \na gate-to-source voltage (V GS) of 2.7V or less. When \nselecting a PFET, key parameters include: \n ●Total gate charge (Q G) \n ●Reverse transfer capacitance (C RSS) \n ●On-resistance ( RDS(ON) ) \n ●Maximum drain-to-source voltage (V DS(MAX) )\n ●Minimum threshold voltage (V TH(MIN) )\nAt high-switching rates, dynamic characteristics (para-  \nmeters 1 and 2 above) that predict switching losses \nmay have more impact on efficiency than R DS(ON) , \nwhich predicts DC losses. Q G includes all capacitance \nassociated with charging the gate. In addition, this \nparameter helps predict the current needed to drive the \ngate at the selected operating frequency. The power \nMOSFET in an inverting converter must have a high \nenough voltage rating to handle the input voltage plus \nthe magnitude of the output voltage and any spikes \ninduced by leakage inductance and ringing. \nAn RC snubber circuit across the drain to ground might be \nrequired to reduce the peak ringing and noise.\nChoose R DS(ON)(MAX)  specified at V GS < VIN(MIN)  to be \none to two times R CS. Verify that V IN(MAX)  < V GS(MAX)  \nand V DS(MAX)  > VIN(MAX)  - VOUT + VD. Choose the rise- \nand-fall times (t R, tF) to be less than 50ns.\nOutput Capacitor Selection\nThe output capacitor (C OUT) does all the filtering in an \ninverting converter. The output ripple is created by the \nvariations in the charge stored in the output capacitor with \neach pulse and the voltage drop across the capacitor’s \nequivalent series resistance (ESR) caused by the current \ninto and out of the capacitor. There are two properties \nof the output capacitor that affect ripple voltage: the  \ncapacitance value, and the capacitor’s ESR. The output \nripple due to the output capacitor’s value is given by:\nVRIPPLE-C  = (ILOAD  × D MAX × TOSC ) / C OUT\nThe output ripple due to the output capacitor’s ESR is \ngiven by:\nVRIPPLE-R  = ILPP × R ESR\nThese two ripple voltages are additive and the total output \nripple is:\nVRIPPLE-T  = VRIPPLE-C  + VRIPPLE-R\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 14\nMAX1846/MAX1847 High-Efficiency, Current-Mode,  \nInverting PWM Controller\nThe ESR-induced ripple usually dominates this last \nequation, so typically output capacitor selection is based \nmostly upon the capacitor's ESR, voltage rating, and  \nripple current rating. Use the following formula to deter -\nmine the maximum ESR for a desired output ripple volt -\nage (V RIPPLE-D ):\nRESR = VRIPPLE-D  / ILPP\nSelect a capacitor with ESR rating less than R ESR. The \nvalue of this capacitor is highly dependent on dielectric \ntype, package size, and voltage rating. In general, when \nchoosing a capacitor, it is recommended to use low-ESR \ncapacitor types such as ceramic, organic, or tanta -\nlum capacitors. Ensure that the selected capacitor has  \nsufficient margin to safely handle the maximum RMS \nripple current.\nFor continuous inductor current the maximum RMS ripple \ncurrent in the output filter capacitor is:\n2 LOADRMS MAX MAX\nMAXII xD DID− =−\nChoosing Compensation Components\nThe MAX1846/MAX1847 are externally loop-compensat -\ned devices. This feature provides flexibility in designs to \naccommodate a variety of applications. Proper compen -\nsation of the control loop is important to prevent excessive \noutput ripple and poor efficiency caused by instability. The \ngoal of compensation is to cancel unwanted poles and \nzeros in the DC-DC converter’s transfer function created \nby the power-switching and filter elements. More precise -\nly, the objective of compensation is to ensure stability by \nensuring that the DC-DC converter’s phase shift is less \nthan 180° by a safe margin, at the frequency where the \nloop gain falls below unity. One method for ensuring ade -\nquate phase margin is to introduce corresponding zeros \nand poles in the feedback network to approximate a sin -\ngle-pole response with a -20dB/decade slope all the way \nto unity-gain crossover.\nCalculating Poles and Zeros\nThe MAX1846/MAX1847 current-mode architecture takes \nthe double pole caused by the inductor and output \ncapacitor and shifts one of these poles to a much higher \nfrequency to make loop compensation easier. To compen -\nsate these devices, we must know the center frequencies \nof the right-half plane zero (z RHP) and the higher frequen -\ncy pole (p OUT2 ). Calculate the z RHP frequency with the \nfollowing formula:()( )\n( )2\nMAX IN(MIN) OUT LOAD\nRHP\nOUT1 D x V V xR\nZ2 xV L\uf8ee\uf8f9−− −\uf8ef\uf8fa\uf8f0\uf8fb=π×\nThe calculations for p OUT2  are very complex. For most \napplications where V OUT does not exceed -48V (in a  \nnegative sense), the p OUT2  will not be lower than 1/8th \nof the oscillator frequency and is generally at a higher \nfrequency than z RHP. Therefore:\npOUT2  ≥ 0.125 × f OSC\nA pole is created by the output capacitor and the load \nresistance. This pole must also be compensated and its \ncenter frequency is given by the formula:\npOUT1  = 1 / (2π × R LOAD  × C OUT)\nFinally, there is a zero introduced by the ESR of the  \noutput capacitor. This zero is determined from the follow -\ning equation:\nzESR = 1 / (2 π × C OUT × R ESR)\nCalculating the Required Pole Frequency\nTo ensure stability of the MAX1846/MAX1847, the gain \nof the error amplifier must roll-off the total loop gain to \n1 before Z RHP or P OUT2  occurs. First, calculate the DC \nopen-loop gain A DC:\nxxM O MAX LOADDC\nCS CSB x G R (1 D ) RAA xR−=\nwhere:\n A CS is the current-sense amplifier gain = 3.3\n B is the feedback-divider attenuation factor =  \nR2\nR1 R2+ \n G M is the error-amplifier transconductance =  \n400 µA/V\n R O is the error-amplifier output resistance = 3 MW\n R CS is the selected current-sense resistor\nDetermining the Compensation Component Values\nSelect a unity-gain crossover frequency (f CROS ), which is \nlower than z RHP and p OUT2  and higher than p OUT1 . Using \nfCROS , calculate the compensation resistor (R COMP ).\nCROS OCOMP\nDC OUT1 CROSf xRR  A xP   f=−\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 15\nMAX1846/MAX1847 High-Efficiency, Current-Mode,  \nInverting PWM Controller\nSelect the next smaller standard value of resistor and \nthen calculate the compensation capacitor required to \ncancel out the output-capacitor-induced pole (P OUT1 ) \ndetermined previously.\nChoose the next larger standard value of capacitor.\nIn order for p COMP  to compensate the loop, the open-\nloop gain must reach unity at a lower frequency than the \nright-half-plane zero or the second output pole, whichever \nis lower in frequency. If the second output pole and the \nright-half-plane zero are close together in frequency, the \nhigher resulting phase shift at unity gain may require \na lower crossover frequency. For duty cycles greater \nthan 50%, slope compensation reduces A DC, reducing \nthe actual crossover frequency from f CROS . It is also a \ngood practice to reduce noise on COMP with a capacitor \n(CCOMP2 ) to ground. To avoid adding extra phase margin \nat the crossover, the capacitor (C COMP2 ) should roll-off \nnoise at five times the crossover frequency. The value for \nCCOMP2  can be found using:\nIt might require a couple iterations to obtain a suitable \ncombination of compensation components.\nFinally, the zero introduced by the output capacitor's \nESR must be compensated. This compensation is \naccomplished by placing a capacitor between REF \nand FB creating a pole directly in the feedback loop. \nCalculate the value of this capacitor using the frequency \nof zESR and the selected feedback resistor values with \nthe formula:\n12FB ESR OUT\n12RRC R xC xR xR+=\nWhen using low-ESR, ceramic chip capacitors (MLCCs) \nat the output, calculate the value of C FB as follows:\n 12FB\nOSC 1 2RRC  2  3.14  f   R   R+=× × ××Applications Information\nMaximum Output Power\nThe maximum output power that the MAX1846/MAX1847 \ncan provide depends on the maximum input power  \navailable and the circuit's efficiency: \nPOUT(MAX)  = Efficiency × P IN(MAX)\nFurthermore, the efficiency and input power are both \nfunctions of component selection. Efficiency losses can \nbe divided into three categories: 1) resistive losses across \nthe inductor, MOSFET on-resistance, current-sense resis -\ntor, rectification diode, and the ESR of the input and out -\nput capacitors; 2) switching losses due to the MOSFET's \ntransition region, and charging the MOSFET's gate \ncapacitance; and 3) inductor core losses. Typically, \n80% efficiency can be assumed for initial calculations. \nThe required input power depends on the inductor  \ncurrent limit, input voltage, output voltage, output current,  \ninductor value, and the switching frequency. The max -\nimum output power is approximated by the following \nformula:\nPMAX = [V IN - (V LIM + ILIM x RDS(ON) )] x I LIM x  \n[1 - (LIR / 2)] x [(-V OUT + VD) / (V IN - VSW - VLIM \n - VOUT + VD)]\nwhere I LIM is the peak current limit and LIR is the inductor \ncurrent-ripple ratio and is calculated by:\nLIR = I LPP / ILDC\nAgain, remember that V OUT for the MAX1846/MAX1847 \nis negative.\nDiode Selection\nThe MAX1846/MAX1847's high-switching frequency \ndemands a high-speed rectifier. Schottky diodes are \nrecommended for most applications because of their \nfast recovery time and low forward voltage. Ensure that \nthe diode's average current rating exceeds the peak \ninductor current by using the diode manufacturer's data. \nAdditionally, the diode's reverse breakdown voltage must \nexceed the potential difference between V OUT and the \ninput voltage plus the leakage-inductance spikes. For \nhigh output voltages (-50V or more), Schottky diodes \nmay not be practical because of this voltage requirement. \nIn these cases, use an ultrafast recovery diode with  \nadequate reverse-breakdown voltage.COMP\nOUT1 COMP1C  6.28 xP xR=\n \n    O COMPCOMP2\nCROS O COMPR RC  5 x 6.28 x f x R x R+=\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 16\nMAX1846/MAX1847 High-Efficiency, Current-Mode,  \nInverting PWM Controller\nInput Filter Capacitor\nThe input capacitor (C IN) must provide the peak current \ninto the inverter. This capacitor is selected the same way \nas the output  capacitor (C OUT). Under ideal conditions, \nthe RMS current for the input capacitor is the same as the \noutput capacitor. The capacitor value and ESR must be \nselected to reduce noise to an acceptable value and also \nhandle the ripple current (I NRMS  where:\nO 2  NRMS MAX MAX\nMAX1.2 xII xD D(I  D )−\n−=\nBypass Capacitor\nIn addition to C IN and C OUT, other ceramic bypass \ncapacitors are required with the MAX1846/MAX1847. \nBypass REF to GND with a 0.1µF or larger capacitor. \nBypass V L to GND with a 0.47µF or larger capacitor. All \nbypass capacitors should be located as close to their \nrespective pins as possible. PC Board Layout Guidelines\nGood PC board layout and routing are required in high-  \nfrequency-switching power supplies to achieve good \nregulation, high efficiency, and stability. It is strongly  \nrecommended that the evaluation kit PC board layouts \nbe followed as closely as possible. Place power components \nas close together as possible, keeping their traces short, \ndirect, and wide. Avoid interconnecting the ground pins \nof the power components using vias through an internal \nground plane. Instead, keep the power components close \ntogether and route them in a “star” ground configuration \nusing component-side copper, then connect the star \nground to internal ground using multiple vias.\nMain Application Circuits\nThe MAX1846/MAX1847 are extremely versatile devices. \nFigure 2 shows a generic schematic of the MAX1846. \nTable 1 lists component values for several typical  \napplications.
