The \ndetector consists of a high-sp eed photovoltaic diode array \nand driver circuitry to switch on/off two discrete high voltage  \nMOSFETs. The relay turns on  (contact closes) with a \nminimum input current of 3 m A through the input LED. The \nrelay turns off (contact opens) with an input voltage of 0.8V \nor less.\nThe single channel config urations, ASSR-3210 and \nASSR-3211, are equivalent to 1 Form A Electromechanical \nRelays (EMR), and  the dual channel co nfiguration, ASSR-\n3220, is equivalent to 2 Form A EMR. They are available in 4-pin SO, 6-pin DIP, 8-pin DIP and Gull Wing Surface Mount \nfor DIP packages. Their e lectrical and switching \ncharacteristics are specified over the temperature range of \n–40°C to +85°C. They are used for general purpose \nswitching of signals and  low power AC/DC loads.\nASSR-3211 enables AC/DC and DC-only output \nconnections. For DC-only conne ction, the output current, Io, \nincreases to 0.4A and the on-resistance, R(ON) reduces to \n2.5\uf057.\nCAUTION! It is advised that normal  static precautions be \ntaken in handling and assembly of this \ncomponent to prevent damage and/or \ndegradation which ma y be induced by ESD.Features\n\uf06eCompact solid-state bidir ectional signal switch\n\uf06eSingle and dual channel normally-off Single-Pole-\nSingle-Throw (SPST) relay\n\uf06e250V output withstand voltage\n\uf06e0.2A or 0.4A current rat ing (See schematic for \nASSR-3211 connect ions A and B.)\n\uf06eLow input current: C MOS compatibility\n\uf06eLow on-resistance: \n– 2Ω typical for DC-only– 8Ω typical for AC/DC\n\uf06eHigh speed switching: – 0.25 ms (T\nON), 0.02 ms (TOFF) typical\n\uf06eHigh transient immunity: >1 kV/μs\n\uf06eHigh input-to-output insulation voltage (safety and \nregulatory approvals)\n– 3750 Vrms for 1 min per UL1577– CSA component acceptance\nApplications\n\uf06eTelecommunication switching\n\uf06eData communications\n\uf06eIndustrial controls\n\uf06eMedical\n\uf06eSecurity\n\uf06eEMR/Reed Relay replacementASSR-3210, ASSR-3211, ASSR-3220\nGeneral-Purpose, Form A, Solid State Relay\n(Photo MOSFET) (250V/0.2A/10Ω)\nBroadcom AV02-0260EN\n2ASSR-3210, ASSR-3211, ASSR-3220  Data Sheet General-Purpose, Form A, Solid State Relay\n(Photo MOSFET) (250V/0.2A/10Ω)\nFunctional Diagram Truth Table\nOpto-isolationTurn -off\nCircuit1\n24\n3\nSingle Channel, SPST Relay,\n1 Form A in 4-Pin SO PackageLED Output\nOff Open\nOn Close\nOrdering Information\nASSR-32xx is UL Recognized with 3 750 Vrms for 1 minute per UL15 77 and is approved under CSA Component Acceptance \nNotice #5.\nTo order, choose a part number from the part number column and combine with the desired opti on from the option column \nto form an order entry. \nExample 1: \nASSR-3211-501E to order product o f 300-mil DIP-6 Gull Wing Surf ace Mount package in Tape and Reel packaging and \nRoHS Compliant.\nExample 2: \nASSR-3220-002E to order p roduct of 300-mil DI P-8 package in tub e packaging and RoHS Compliant.\nOption data sheets are available.

The use of a pulsed signal (≤30 ms) implies that \neach junction temperature is equal to the ambient and case temperatures. The steady-state resistance, Rss, on the \nother hand, is the value of the resistance measured across \nthe output contact when a DC current signal is applied to the output pins for a duration sufficient to reach thermal \nequilibrium. Rss includes the ef fects of the temp erature rise \nin the device. \nDerating curves are shown in Figure 1  and Figure 2 , \nspecifying the maximum output current allowable for a given \nambient temperature. The maximum allowable output current and power dissipation are related by the expression \nRss = Po(max) / (Io(max))\n2 from which Rss can be \ncalculated. Staying within th e safe area ensures that the \nsteady-state MOSFET junction temperature remains less \nthan 125°C. Turn On Time and Turn Off Time \nVariation \nThe ASSR-32xx Series exhibits a very fast tu rn on and turn \noff time. Both the turn on and  turn off time c an be adjusted \nby choosing proper forward current as depicted in Figure 9  \nand Figure 11 . The changes of the turn on and turn off time \nwith ambient temperature are also shown in Figure 10  and \nFigure 12 .Parameter Sym. Min. Typ. Max.

#### Description:
The ASSR-3220-302E is a dual-channel, solid-state relay (SSR) that utilizes an AlGaAs infrared light-emitting diode (LED) input stage optically coupled to a high-voltage output detector circuit. It is designed to switch on/off two discrete high-voltage MOSFETs, functioning similarly to electromechanical relays (EMRs). The relay operates with a minimum input current of 3 mA and can handle low power AC/DC loads.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Telecommunication Switching:** Used in systems that require reliable signal switching.
- **Data Communications:** Ideal for applications needing fast and efficient data transfer.
- **Industrial Controls:** Suitable for controlling machinery and processes in industrial settings.
- **Medical Equipment:** Can be used in medical devices requiring isolation and control.
- **Security Systems:** Effective in switching signals in security applications.
- **EMR/Reed Relay Replacement:** Provides a solid-state alternative to traditional electromechanical relays.

This component is particularly valued for its compact design, high reliability, and ability to handle high voltages and currents, making it suitable for a wide range of electronic applications.
