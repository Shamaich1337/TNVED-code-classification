Cautions regarding noise \nBe aware that when voltage is applied suddenly between the photocoupler’s input and output or between \ncollector-emitters at startup, the output transistor may enter the on state, even if the voltage is within the \nabsolute maximum ratings. \n \n3. Measurement conditions of current transfer ratios (CTR), which differ according to photocoupler \nCheck the setting values before use, since the forward current conditions at CTR measurement differ \naccording to product. \nWhen using products other than at the specified forward current, the characteristics curves may differ \nfrom the standard curves due to CTR value variations or the like. This tendency may sometimes be \nobvious, especially below I F = 1 mA. \nTherefore, check the characteristics under the actual operating conditions and thoroughly take variations \nor the like into consideration before use. \n \nUSAGE  CAUTIONS \n1. Protect against static electricity when handling. \n2. Avoid storage at a high temperature and high humidity. \n \n \n \nPS2801C-1, PS2801C-4 e \nR08DS0072EJ0402  Rev.4.02  Page 13 of 15 \nOct 11, 2019  SPECIFICATION  OF  VDE  MARKS  LICENSE  DOCUMENT  \nParameter Symbol Rating Unit \nClimatic test class (IEC 60068-1/DIN EN 60068-1)  55/100/21  \nDielectric strength \nmaximum operating isolation voltage \nTest voltage (partial discharge test, procedure a for type test and \nrandom test) \nUpr = 1.6 \uf0b4 UIORM, Pd \uf03c 5 pC  \nUIORM \nUpr  \n705 \n1 128  \nVpeak \nVpeak \nTest voltage (partial discharge test, procedure b for all devices) \nUpr = 1.875 \uf0b4 UIORM, Pd \uf03c 5 pC Upr 1 322 V peak \nHighest permissible overvoltage U IOTM 6 000 V peak \nDegree of pollution (IEC 60664-1/DIN EN 60664-1 (VDE 0110-1))  2  \nComparative tracking index (IEC 60112/DIN EN 60112 (VDE 0303-11))  CTI 175  \nMaterial group (IEC 60664-1/DIN EN 60664-1 (VDE 0110-1))  III a  \nStorage temperature range T stg \uf02d55 to +150  \uf0b0C \nOperating temperature range T A \uf02d55 to +100  \uf0b0C \nIsolation resistance, minimum value \nVIO = 500 V dc at T A = 25\uf0b0C \nVIO = 500 V dc at T A MAX. at least 100 \uf0b0C  \nRis MIN. \nRis MIN.  \n1012 \n1011  \n\uf057 \n\uf057 \nSafety maximum ratings (maximum permissible in case of fault, see \nthermal derating curve) \nPackage temperature \nCurrent (input current I F, Psi = 0) \nPower (output or total power dissipation) \nIsolation resistance \nVIO = 500 V dc at T A = Tsi  \n \nTsi \nIsi \nPsi \n \nRis MIN.  \n \n150 \n300 \n500 \n \n109  \n \n\uf0b0C \nmA \nmW \n \n\uf057 \n \n  \n Dependence of maximum safety ratings with package temperature \n \n \n\nPS2801C-1, PS2801C-4 e \nR08DS0072EJ0402  Rev.4.02  Page 14 of 15 \nOct 11, 2019  Method a)   Destructive Test, Type and Sample Test  \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMethod b)   Non-destructive Test, 100% Production Test  \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPS2801C-1, PS2801C-4 e \nR08DS0072EJ0402  Rev.4.02  Page 15 of 15 \nOct 11, 2019   Caution  GaAs Products  This product uses gallium arsenide (GaAs). \nGaAs vapor and powder are hazardous to human health if inhaled or ingested, so please observe \nthe following points. \n• Follow related laws and ordinances when disposing of the product.
