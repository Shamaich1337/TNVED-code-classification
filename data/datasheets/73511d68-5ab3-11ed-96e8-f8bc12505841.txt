Proper ESD control techniques \nshould be used when handling these devices.  Recommended Layout  \nRecommended Decoupling Capacitors: 100pF 0402, 10µF 0805  \nApp Note [1] Biasing -  \nAs shown in the Pin Designations table, the device \nis operated by biasing VD1,2,3 at 5 V with 70, \n140, 280 mA respectively. It is recommended to \nuse active bias to keep the currents constant in \norder to maintain the best performance over         \ntemperature. Depending on the supply voltage \navailable and the power dissipation constraints, \nthe bias circuit may be a single transistor or a low \npower operational amplifier, with a low value        \nresistor in series with the drain supply used to \nsense the current. The gate of the pHEMT is        \ncontrolled to maintain correct drain current and \nthus drain voltage. The typical gate voltage           \nneeded to do this is -1 V. Make sure to sequence \nthe applied voltage to ensure negative gate bias is \navailable before applying the positive drain supply.  App Note [2] Board Layout -  \nAs shown in the board layout, it is recommended \nto provide 100 pF decoupling caps as close to the \nbias pins as possible, with additional 10 μF       \ndecoupling caps.  \n7 7 \nMACOM Technology Solutions Inc.
