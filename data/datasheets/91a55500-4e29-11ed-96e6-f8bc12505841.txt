They provide excellent circuit \nreliability and low cost by eliminating external compo -\nnents and adjustments when used with 5Vpowered or \n3V-powered circuits. The MAX811/MAX812 also provide \na debounced manual reset input.\nThese devices perform a single function: They assert a \nreset signal whenever the V CC supply voltage falls below \na preset threshold, keeping it asserted for at least 140ms \nafter V CC has risen above the reset threshold. The only \ndifference between the two devices is that the MAX811 \nhas an active-low RESET output (which is guaranteed \nto be in the correct state for V CC down to 1V), while the \nMAX812 has an active-high RESET output. The reset \ncomparator is designed to ignore fast transients on V CC. \nReset thresholds are available for operation with a variety \nof supply voltages.\nLow supply current makes the MAX811/MAX812 ideal for \nuse in portable equipment.

These μP supervisory circuits assert reset \nto prevent code execution errors during power-up, power-\ndown, or brownout conditions.\nRESET  is guaranteed to be a logic low for V CC > 1V. \nOnce V CC exceeds the reset threshold, an internal timer \nkeeps RESET  low for the reset timeout period; after this \ninterval, RESET  goes high.\nIf a brownout condition occurs (V CC dips below the reset \nthreshold), RESET  goes low. Any time V CC goes below \nthe reset threshold, the internal timer resets to zero, and \nRESET  goes low. The internal timer starts after V CC \nreturns above the reset threshold, and RESET  remains \nlow for the reset timeout period.\nThe manual reset input ( MR) can also initiate a reset. See \nthe Manual Reset Input section.\nThe MAX812 has an active-high RESET output that is the \ninverse of the MAX811’s RESET  output.Manual Reset Input\nMany μP-based products require manual reset capabil -\nity, allowing the operator, a test technician, or external \nlogic circuitry to initiate a reset. A logic low on MR asserts \nreset. Reset remains asserted while MR is low, and for \nthe Reset Active Timeout Period (t RP) after MR returns \nhigh. This input has an internal 20kΩ pull-up resistor, so \nit can be left open if it is not used. MR can be driven with \nTTL or CMOS-logic levels, or with open-drain/collector \noutputs. Connect a normally open momentary switch from \nMR to GND to create a manual-reset function; external \ndebounce circuitry is not required. If MR is driven from \nlong cables or if the device is used in a noisy environment, \nconnecting a 0.1μF capacitor from MR to ground provides \nadditional noise immunity.\nReset Threshold Accuracy\nThe MAX811/MAX812 are ideal for systems using a 5V \n±5% or 3V ±5% power supply with ICs specified for 5V \n±10% or 3V ±10%, respectively. They are designed to \nmeet worst-case specifications over temperature. The \nreset is guaranteed to assert after the power supply \nfalls out of regulation, but before power drops below the \nminimum specified operating voltage range for the system \nICs. The thresholds are pre-trimmed and exhibit tight dis -\ntribution, reducing the range over which an undesirable \nreset may occur.PIN\nNAME FUNCTION\nMAX811 MAX812\n1 1 GND Ground\n2 — RESETActive-Low Reset Output.

This graph was generated \nusing a negative-going pulse applied to V CC, starting \nabove the actual reset threshold and ending below it by \nthe magnitude indicated (reset comparator overdrive). \nThe graph indicates the typical maximum pulse width a \nnegative-going V CC transient may have without causing \na reset pulse to be issued. As the magnitude of the tran -\nsient increases (goes farther below the reset threshold), \nthe maximum allowable pulse width decreases. Typically, \na VCC transient that goes 125mV below the reset thresh -\nold and lasts 40μs or less (MAX81_L/M) or 20μs or less \n(MAX81_T/S/R) will not cause a reset pulse to be issued. \nA 0.1μF capacitor mounted as close as possible to V CC \nprovides additional transient immunity.Ensuring a Valid RESET  Output  \nDown to V CC = 0V\nWhen V CC falls below 1V, the MAX811 RESET  output \nno longer sinks current—it becomes an open circuit. \nTherefore, high-impedance CMOS-logic inputs connected \nto the RESET  output can drift to undetermined voltages. \nThis presents no problem in most applications, since most \nμP and other circuitry is inoperative with V CC below 1V. \nHowever, in applications where the RESET  output must \nbe valid down to 0V, adding a pulldown resistor to the \nRESET  pin will cause any stray leakage currents to flow \nto ground, holding RESET  low (Figure 2). R1’s value is \nnot critical; 100kΩ is large enough not to load RESET  and \nsmall enough to pull RESET  to ground.\nA 100kΩ pull-up resistor to V CC is also recommended \nfor the MAX812 if RESET is required to remain valid for \nVCC < 1V.Figure 1.
