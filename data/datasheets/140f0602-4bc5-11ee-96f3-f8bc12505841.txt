Introduction  \n1.1. General Description   \nThe TC58CVG2S0HRAIJ  is a Serial I nterface NAND Flash memory for embedded applications which supports the \nSPI interface.  The TC58CVG2S0HRAIJ  is organized as (4096 + 128) bytes × 64 pages × 2048 blocks. The device \nhas a 422 4 byte data buffer which allows program and read data to be transferred between the buffer and the memory \ncell array in 4 224-byte increments. The Erase o peration is implemented in a single block unit (256 Kbytes + 8 Kbytes : \n4224 bytes × 64 pages). The devi ce has the high speed mode for sequential Page Read operation. When high speed \nmode is enabled, the average of t R is shortened.  \nThe TC58CVG2S0HRAIJ  has ECC logic on the chip and 8bit read errors for each (512 bytes + 16 bytes) can be \ncorrected. The details  of the internal ECC function is shown in 4.15. Internal ECC.  \n \n1.2. Definitions and Abbreviations  \nSPI \nSerial Peripheral Interface  \n \nAddress  \nThe address is comprised of a column address (CA) with 13bits and a row address (RA) with 17bits.

Block Lock Operation  \nThe Block Lock Operation prevents Page Program, Block Protection  and Block Erase operations. The users \nset the range of locked blocks as the entire device or a portion of the device using the BL bits (bits [5:3]) in \naddress A0h of the feature table shown in Table 12. The users set the BL bits by the Set Feature operation. \nAfter the power on sequence, all blocks are locked (bits [5:3] are all set to 1). If the Program Execute (10h), \nProtect Execute  (2Ah) or Block Erase (D8h) command i s issued to locked blocks, Program Fail or Erase Fail \nwill be indicated in the feature table shown in Table 12.  \nThe users must clear / change the BL bits using Set Feature command to unlock the entire of the device or \nportion of the device. When BRWD bit i s set and WP------------- pin is Low, the users cannot switch the BRWD and the \nBL bits.  \nThe Block Lock Operation is different from the Block Protection Operation.   \nTable 16  Block Lock Setting  \nBL2 BL1 BL0 Protected Area  Protected Blocks  \n0 0 0 All Unlocked  None  \n0 0 1 Upper 1/64 Locked  Block  2016 to 2047  \n0 1 0 Upper 1/32 Locked  Block 1984 to 2047  \n0 1 1 Upper 1/16 Locked  Block 1920 to 2047  \n1 0 0 Upper 1/8 Locked  Block 1792  to 2047  \n1 0 1 Upper 1/4 Locked  Block 1536 to 2047  \n1 1 0 Upper 1/2 Locked  Block 1024 to 2047  \n1 1 1 All Locked  Block 0 to 2047  \n \n   \n \n4.11.  Block Protection Operation (One Time Program)   \nThe Block Protection Operation provides the function to prohibit the Program and Erase operations to user ’s \nselected blocks. The users can protect individual blocks using the Set Feature, Write Enable and Protect \nExecute commands. The last 128 blocks of the device are able to be set to protected blocks. The block \nprotection  setting is permanent. Once a block is protected, the users cannot unprotect the block.   \nWhen PRT_E (bit [2 ]) in address B0h of the feature table is set to 1, and the users issue the Protect Execute \ncommand (2Ah), the user block will become a protected bl ock. The user s must set the PRT_E bit (bit [2 ]) just \nbefore the Write Enable command for the Protect Execute. After the protection to the block,  the users must \nclear bit [2 ] in address B0h using the Set Feature command. The users can issue the Protect Exec ute (2Ah) \nonly one time for each block.  \nThe Block Protection Operation is different from the Block Lock Operation.  \n \nTo complete the operation  to protect block “N”, the command sequence must be executed as follows.  \n1. Set Feature (1Fh)  : To set PRT_E bit [2] in addre ss B0h to block protection mode  \n2. Write Enable (06h)  : To enable the Protect Execute command  \n3. Protect Execute (2Ah) for block “N”  : To protect the block “N”  \n4. Get Feature (0Fh)   : To read the status (OI P and PRG_F bits) of the device  \n5. Set  Feature (1Fh)  : To clea r PRT_E bit [ 2] in address B0h  \nGet Feature command is repeatable command.  \n \nTable 17  Block Protection Setting  \nPRT_E  State  \n0 Normal Operation (Default)  \n1 Block Protection Enable – The Protect Execute command (2Ah) is acceptable for Block P rotection.  \n \nTable 18  Block Number for Block Protection  \nBlock Number  Block Protection  \nBlock 0 – Block 1919  The users cannot protect these blocks by Block Protection operation.  \nBlock 1920  – Block  2047  The use rs can protect these blocks by B lock Protection operation.  \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \nTC58CVG2S0HRAIJ  \n 2019 -10-01 34 © 2019 KIOXIA Corporation  \n4.11.1.

Internal ECC  \nThe device has internal ECC and it generates error correction code during the busy time in a Program operation. \nThe ECC logic manages 9bit error detection and 8bit error correction in each 528 bytes of main and spare data. \nA sectio n of the main area (512 bytes) and spare area (16 bytes) are paired for ECC calculation. During the \nRead operation, the device ex ecutes ECC by itself. Once the R ead command is executed, the Get Feature \ncommand can be issued to check the read status. The re ad status is valid until other acceptable commands \nare executed . \nThe device has the functions of Bit F lip Detection  and Maximum Bit Flip Count R eport. Internal ECC detects \nthe bit flips in each sector and the maximum bit flip count in a page. These results are indicated in the feature \ntable as shown in Table 12.  \nTable 22  Page Assignment  \n1st  \nMain  2nd  \nMain  3rd  \nMain  4th  \nMain  5th  \nMain  6th  \nMain  7th  \nMain  8th  \nMain  1st  \nSpare  2nd  \nSpare  3rd  \nSpare  4th  \nSpare  5th  \nSpare  6th  \nSpare  7th  \nSpare  8th  \nSpare  Internal ECC  \nParity Area  \n512B  512B  512B  512B  512B  512B  512B  512B  16B 16B 16B 16B 16B 16B 16B 16B 128B  \nTable 23  Definition of 528 bytes Data Pair  \nData Pair  Column Address  \nMain Area  Spare Area  \n1st Data Pair (Sector 0)  0 to 511 4096  to 4111  \n2nd Data Pair (Sector  1) 512 to 1023  4112  to 4127  \n3rd Data Pair (Sector  2) 1024  to 1535  4128  to 4143  \n4th Data Pair (Sector 3)  1536  to 2047  4144  to 4159  \n5th Data Pair (Sector 4)  2048  to 2559  4160  to 4175  \n6th Data Pair (Sector 5)  2560  to 3071  4176 to 4191  \n7th Data Pair (Sector 6)  3072  to 3583  4192  to 4207  \n8th Data Pair (Sector 7)  3584  to 4095  4208  to 4223  \nNote:  The ECC parity code generated by internal ECC is stored in column addresses 4224 -4351 and the users cannot access \nto these specific addresses when internal ECC is enabled.  While using the Partial Page Program, the users must program \nthe data to main and spare area simultaneously by the definition of data pair.  \n4.15.1.  ECC Switch  \nThe internal ECC is enabled after the power on sequence. The user s set  or clear  the ECC_E bit (bit [4]) in \naddress B0h of the feature table to enable or disable the internal ECC by the Set Feature command.  If the \nECC_E bit is cleared to 0 in the feature table, internal ECC will be disabled. In this case, the spare area size \nis changed from 128 bytes to 256 bytes automatically. In case of  switching the ECC_E bit, the users must \nissue the Set Feature comma nd just before the Page Read, Page Program or Block Erase operation.  Once \nusers decide the internal ECC condition either Enable or Disable, the same condition must be kept in use.  \n4.15.2.  ECC Status  \nThe ECC Status function is used to monitor the error correction stat us. The device can correct up to 8bit errors. \nECC is performed on the NAND Flash main and spare areas. The ECC status is indicated in the ECCS1 and \nECCS0 bit (bits [5:4]) in address C0h of the feature table shown in Table 15. The users issue the Get Feature \ncommand to read the ECC status.  \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \nTC58CVG2S0HRAIJ  \n 2019 -10-01 39 © 2019 KIOXIA Corporation  \n4.15.3.  ECC Bit Flip Count Detection  \nThe ECC Bit Flip Count Detection function detects the bit flip count in a page. The users set the threshold bit \ncount using the Set Feature command. The threshold bit count is decided by the BFD bits  in address 10h in the \nfeature table as shown in Table 12. The detected results will be indicated in the BFS bits (bits [7:0]) in address \n20h. When bit flips exceed the threshold in a sector, the BFS bits are set after the Read Buffer command.  \nTable 24  Bit Flip Count Detection Setting (BFD)  \nBFD3  BFD2  BFD1  BFD0  Description  \n0 0 0 0 Reserved  \n0 0 0 1 Dete ct 1 bit flip in a sector  \n0 0 1 0 Detect 2 bit flips in a sector  \n0 0 1 1 Detect 3 bit flips in a sector  \n0 1 0 0 Detect 4 bit flips in a sector  (Default)  \n0 1 0 1 Detect 5 bit flips in a sector  \n0 1 1 0 Detect 6 bit flips in a sector  \n0 1 1 1 Detect 7 bit flips in a sector  \n1 0 0 0 Detect 8 bit flips in a sector  \n1 1 1 1 Detect the uncorrectable err or (9+ bit errors in a sector)  \n \nTable 25  Bit Flip Count Detection Status (BFS) (Feature Table - 20h Address Description)  \nBit Symbol  Parameter  Read  \n/ Write  Description  \n7 BFS7  Bit Flip Count Detection Status 7  R Bit flip count detection status 7 indicates that the bit flip count in sector 7 is \nmore than threshold bit count.  \n0b: Bit flip count in sector 7 is less than the threshold.  \n1b: Bit flip count in sector 7 is equal to or more than the threshold bit count.  \n6 BFS6  Bit Flip Count Detection Status 6  R Bit flip count detection status 6 indicates that the bit flip count in sector 6 is \nmore than threshold bit count.  \n0b: Bit flip count in sector 6 is less than the threshold.  \n1b: Bit flip count in sector 6 is equal to or more than the threshold bi t count.  \n5 BFS5  Bit Flip Count Detection Status 5  R Bit flip count detection status 5 indicates that the bit flip count in sector 5 is \nmore than threshold bit count.  \n0b: Bit flip count in sector 5 is less than the threshold.  \n1b: Bit flip count in sector 5  is equal to or more than the threshold bit count.  \n4 BFS4  Bit Flip Count Detection Status 4  R Bit flip count detection status 4 indicates that the bit flip count in sector 4 is \nmore than threshold bit count.  \n0b: Bit flip count in sector 4 is less than the  threshold.  \n1b: Bit flip count in sector 4 is equal to or more than the threshold bit count.  \n3 BFS3  Bit Flip Count Detection Status 3  R Bit flip count detection status 3 indicates that the bit flip count in sector 3 is \nmore than threshold bit count.  \n0b: B it flip count in sector 3 is less than the threshold.  \n1b: Bit flip count in sector 3 is equal to or more than the threshold bit count.  \n2 BFS2  Bit Flip Count Detection Status 2  R Bit flip count detection status 2 indicates that the bit flip count in sector 2 is \nmore than threshold bit count.  \n0b: Bit flip count in sector 2 is less than the threshold.  \n1b: Bit flip count in sector 2 is equal to or more than the threshold bit count.  \n1 BFS1  Bit Flip Count Detection Status 1  R Bit flip count detection status 1 indicates that the bit flip count in sector 1 is \nmore than threshold bit count.  \n0b: Bit flip count in sector 1 is less than the threshold.  \n1b: Bit flip count in sector 1 is equal to or more than the threshold bit count.  \n0 BFS0  Bit Flip Count Detection Status 0  R Bit flip count detection status 0 indicates that the bit flip count in sector 0 is \nmore than threshold bit count.  \n0b: Bit flip count in sector 0 is less than the threshold.  \n1b: Bit flip count in sector 0 is equal to or more than the threshold bit count.  \n \n \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \nTC58CVG2S0HRAIJ  \n 2019 -10-01 40 © 2019 KIOXIA Corporation  \n4.15.4.

Stored data may be corrupted if an unknown command is entered during the command cycle.  \n \n6.2. Restriction of Commands while in the Busy State  \nDuring the operation in progress, do not input any command except Get Feature  (0Fh) and Reset  (FFh or FEh) . \n \n6.3. Addressing for Page Pr ogram Operation  \nWithin a block, the pages must be programm ed consecutively from the LSB (L east Significant Bit) page of the \nblock to MSB ( Most Significant Bit) page of the block. Random page address programming is prohibited.  \n \n \n6.4. Several Programming Cycles on the Same Page (Partial Page Program)  \nInternal ECC ON:  \nPartial Page Program should follow the Table 22 restriction while ECC_E bit is set to 1.  \nECC Parity Code is generated during Program operation on Main area (512 byte) + Spare area (16byte),  and \nthis parity code is written to the Parity area as shown in Table 22. \nWhile using th e Partial Page Program, the user must program the data to main and spare area simultaneously \nby the definition of sector in section “Internal ECC”.  \n \nFor example, each segment can be programmed individually as follows:  \nProgram Load Rando m Data x1 (84h) and  Program Load Random Data x4 (34h or C4) commands  can be used \nto skip column address within the selected page to improve the data input operation.  \nDATA IN: Data (1)  \nPage 0  \nData Buffer  \nPage 2  \nPage 1  \nPage 31  \nPage 63  \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(32) \n(64) \nData (64)  \nFrom the LSB page to MSB page  \nDATA IN: Data (1)  \nPage 0  \nData Buffer  \nPage 2  \nPage 1  \nPage 31  \nPage 63  \n(2) \n(32) \n(3) \n(1) \n(64) \nData (64)  \ne.g.) Random page program (Prohibition)  \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \nTC58CVG2S0HRAIJ  \n 2019 -10-01 44 © 2019 KIOXIA Corporation  \nInternal ECC OFF:  \nEach segment can be programmed individually as follows while ECC_E bit is set to 0 . \n \nProgram Load Rando m Data  x1 (84h) and Program Load Random Data x4 (34h or C4) command s can be used \nto skip column address within the selected page to improve the data input operation.  \n \n6.5. Power Off Timing  \nPlease do not turn off the power before Page Program , Block Protection  and Erase operation is complete d. \nAvoid using the device when the battery is low. Power shortage and/or power failure before Write/Erase \noperation is complete d will cause loss of data and/or damage to data.  \n \n6.6. Invalid Blocks  (Bad B locks)  \nThe device occasionally  contains unusable blocks. Therefore, the following issues must be recognized:  \nThe Page Program, Block Protection and Erase operation are prohibited to the invalid blocks. When the users \nissue the Program or Erase command to the initial invalid blocks, the  device ignores these commands \nautomatically and Program Fail or Erase Fail is indicated in the feature table as shown in Table 12. Check if the \ndevice has any bad blocks after installation into the system. Refer to the test flow for initial bad block detection. \nBad blocks which are detected by the test flow must be managed as unusable blocks by the system.

Reliability Guidance  \nThis reliability guidance is intended t o provide  some guidance related to using NAND F lash with 8 b it ECC for \neach 512 bytes. NAND F lash memory cells are gradually worn out and the reliability level of memory cells  is \ndegraded by repeating Write and Erase operation of ‘0’ data in each block. For detailed reliability data, please \nrefer to the reliability note for each product.  \nAlthough random bit errors may occur during use, it does not necessarily mean that a block  is bad.  \nGenerally, a block should be marked as bad when a program status failure or erase status failure is detected.  \nThe reliability of NAND F lash memory cells during the actual usage on system level depends on the usage and \nenvironmental conditions. KIOXIA  adopts the checker pattern data, 0x55 & 0xAA for alternative Write/Erase \ncycles, for the reliability test.  \n \nWrite/Erase Endurance  \nWrite/Erase endurance failures may occur in a cell, page, or block, and are detected by doing a Status Read \nafter either an Auto Page Program or Auto Block Erase operation. The cumulative bad block count will \nincrease along with the number of Write/Erase cycles.  \n \nData Retention  \nThe data in NAND F lash memory may change after a certain amount of storage time. This is due to ch arge \nloss or charge gain. After block erasure and reprogramming, the block may become usable again.  \nData Retention time is generally influenced by the number of Write/Erase cycles and temperature.  \n \nHere is  a graph plotting the relationship between Write/Erase Endurance and Data Retention.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRead Disturb  \nA Read operatio n may disturb the data in NAND F lash memory. The data may change due to charge gain. \nUsually, bit errors occur on other pages in the block, not the page being read. After a large number of read \ncycles (between block erases), a tiny charge may build up and can cause a cell to be soft programmed to \nanother state. After block erasure and reprogramming, the block may beco me usable again. Read Disturb \ncapability is generally influenced by the number of Write/Erase cycles.  \n \nData  Retention  \n[Years] \nWrite/Erase Endurance [Cycles]  \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \nTC58CVG2S0HRAIJ  \n 2019 -10-01 47 © 2019 KIOXIA Corporation  \n6.10 NAND Management  \nNAND Management such as Bad Block Management, ECC treatment and Wear Leveling, but not limited to \nthese treatments, should be recognized and incorporated in the system design.  \nECC treatment for read data is mandatory against random bit errors, and host should monitor ECC status to \ntake appropriate measures such as rewrite in consideration of Wear Leveling before uncorrectable Error occurs. \nTo realize robust system design , generally it is necessary t o prevent the concentration of Write/E rase cycles at \nthe specific blocks by adopting Wear Leveli ng which manages to distribute W rite/Erase cycles evenly among \nNAND F lash memory. And also it is nec essary to avoid dummy ‘0’ data write, e.g. ‘0’ data padding, which \naccelerate block endurance degradation.  \n \nContinuous Write and Erase cycling with high percentage of \'0\'  bits in data pattern can lead to faster block \nendurance degradation.   \n \n \n \nExample: NAND cell array with ‘0’ data padding  \n \n \n010010000000\n010110000000\n101000000000\n110010000000\n001100000000\n101010000000\n010100000000\n101010000000\n010011111111\n010111111111\n101001111111\n110011111111\n001101111111\n101011111111\n010101111111\n101011111111\n: “1” data cell  \n : “0” data cell  \n 1 \n 0 \nUser data area  \n User data area  \n Remaining area  \n Remaining area  \n(a)Accelerate block endurance degradation \nby fixed dummy “0” data write  \n(b)“1” data for Remaining area  \n(Recommended)  \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \nTC58CVG2S0HRAIJ  \n 2019 -10-01 48 © 2019 KIOXIA Corporation  \n7.
