Introduction\n   Lithium tantalate pyroelectric infrared detector is a kind of thermal detector with excellent \nperformance.

How to use pyroelectric infrared detector correctly?  \n(1)    Pyroelectric infrared detector is a typical AC working device. When the target is stationary a nd the \ntemperature is constant, there is no signal output. Only when there is transient target movement, or \ntemperature change, or modulation with chopper, will there be signal output.  \n(2)    The infrared radiation power received by the pyroelectric infrar ed detector is very small, but the \ndetection rate is very high. The detector area is 1 mm, and the power of 1mW on the detector can \ngenerate a signal of 2500mV . Without any amplifier, it is enough to make the detector in the off state \nor saturated state. W hen the radiation power is less than 10μW, the output signal has a good linear \nchange.  \n(3)    When operating the pyroelectric infrared detector, the temperature of the pyroelectric infrared \ndetector is changed due to the contact of hands, especially after welding, so when the detector works \nagain, it has to wait for a period of time before it can resume normal work. Turn on the power supply \nimmediately after the detector is warmed up, and the detector may be in the off state at this time.  \n(4)    Pyroelectri c infrared detectors are piezoelectric and sensitive to sound, electromagnetic waves and \nvibration. When using pyroelectric infrared detectors, proper shock absorption and shielding are \nnecessary.  \n(5)    During the operation, use and storage of the pyroele ctric infrared detector, rapid temperature change \nshould be avoided. When the temperature change rate is less than 1 ℃/ min, the detector can keep \nnormal operation.  \n(6)    When welding the pyroelectric infrared detector, clamp the root of the pin with tweez ers to help \ndissipate heat and prevent the sensitive element of the detector from being damaged. To prevent \ncomponents from falling. Spare components should be kept dry. To keep the window clean, when \nthere is dirt, you can gently wipe it clean with an alc ohol cotton ball.  \n(7)    When installing the detector, it is forbidden to apply mechanical pressure to prevent the sensitive \nelements and windows of the detector from being damaged due to pressure.  \n(8)    When the detector is taken out of the box, measured  and installed, it must be equipped with \nelectrostatic protection tools to prevent high voltag e from penetrating the detector’ s field effect \ntransistor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \nSARTEC\n'}]
