Address and data are \ntransferred serially through an I2C interface. The clock/calendar provides seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, \nmonth, and year information. The end of the month date is automatically adjusted for months with fewer than 31 \ndays, including corrections for leap year. The clock operates in either the 24- hour or 12- hour format with AM/PM \nindicator. The DS1338 has a built -in power -sense circuit that detects power failures and automatically switches to \nthe V BAT supply.  \nDS133 8 \n \n8 of 16 OPERATION \nThe DS1338 operates as a slave device on the serial bus. Access is obtained by implementing a START condition \nand providing a device identification code, followed by data. Subsequent registers can be accessed sequentially \nuntil a STOP condition is executed. The device is fully accessible and data can be written and read when V CC is \ngreater than V PF. However, when V CC falls below VPF, the internal clock registers are blocked from any access. If \nVPF is less than V BAT, the device power is switched from V CC to V BAT when V CC drops below V PF. If V PF is greater \nthan V BAT, the device power is switched from V CC to V BAT when V CC drops below V BAT. The oscillator and \ntimekeeping functions are maintained from the V BAT source until V CC is returned to nominal levels.  The block \ndiagram (Figure 3) shows the main elements of the DS1338.  \n An enable bit in the seconds register controls the oscillator. Oscillator startup times are highly dependent upon \ncrystal characteristics, PC board leakage, and layout. High ESR and excessi ve capacitive loads are the major \ncontributors to long start -up times. A circuit using a crystal with the recommended characteristics and proper layout \nusually starts within 1 second.  \n \nPOWER CONTROL  \nThe power -control function is provided by a precise, temperature- compensated voltage reference and a \ncomparator circuit that monitors the V CC level. The device is fully accessible and data can be written and read when \nVCC is greater than V PF. However, when V CC falls below V PF, the internal clock registers are bl ocked from any \naccess. If V PF is less than V BAT, the device power is switched from V CC to V BAT when V CC drops below V PF. If V PF is \ngreater than V BAT, the device power is switched from V CC to V BAT when V CC drops below V BAT. The registers are \nmaintained from  the V BAT source until V CC is returned to nominal levels ( Table 1). After V CC returns above V PF, read \nand write access is allowed after t REC (Figure 1). On the first applic ation of power to the device the time and date \nregisters are reset to 01/01/00 01 00:00:00 ( DD/MM/YY DOW HH:MM:SS).  The CH bit in the seconds register will be set \nto a 0. \n \nTable 1.

The oscillator circuit does not require any external r esistors or \ncapacitors to operate. Table 2 specifies several crystal parameters for the external crystal. Figure 3 shows a \nfunctional schematic of the oscillator circuit. The startup time is usually less than 1 second when using a crystal with the specified characteristics.  \n \nTable 2.

Crystal \nfrequency drift caused by temperature shifts creates additional error. External circuit noise coupled into the \noscillator circuit can result in the clock running fast. Figure 4 shows a typical PC board layout for isolating the \ncrystal and oscillator from noise. Refer to Application Note 58: Crystal Considerations with Dallas Real -Time Clocks \nfor detailed information.  \n \nDS1338C ONLY  \nThe DS1338C integrates a standard 32,768Hz crystal in the package. Typical accuracy at nominal V CC and +25°C \nis approximately 10ppm. Refer to Application Note 58 for information about crystal accuracy vs. temperature.  \n \nFigure 4. Typical PC Board Layout for Crystal  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nRTC AND RAM ADDRESS MAP  \nTable 3 shows the address map for the RTC and RAM registers. The RTC registers and control register are located \nin address locations 00h to 07h. The RAM registers are located in address locations 08h to 3Fh. During a multibyte \naccess, when the register pointer reaches 3Fh (the end of RAM space) it  wraps around to location 00h (the \nbeginning of the clock space). On an I2C START, STOP, or register pointer incrementing to location 00h, the \ncurrent time and date is transferred to a second set of registers. The time and date in the secondary registers are \nread in a multibyte data transfer, while the clock continues to run. This eliminates the need to re- read the registers \nin case of an update of the main registers during a read.  \n \nCLOCK AND CALENDAR  \nThe time and calendar information is obtained by reading the appropriate register bytes. See Figure 6 for the RTC \nregisters. The time and calendar are set or initialized by writing the appropriate register bytes. The contents of the \ntime and calendar registers are in the BCD format. Bit 7 of Register 0 is the c lock halt (CH) bit. When this bit is set \nto 1, the oscillator is disabled. When cleared to 0, the oscillator is enabled. The clock can be halted whenever the \ntimekeeping functions are not required, which minimizes V BAT current (I BATDAT ) when VCC is not applied.  \n \nThe day -of-week register increments at midnight. Values that correspond to the day of week are user -defined but \nmust be sequential (i.e., if 1 equals Sunday, then 2 equals Monday, and so on). Illogical time and date entries \nresult in undefined opera tion. \n \nWhen reading or writing the time and date registers, secondary (user) buffers are used to prevent errors when the \ninternal registers update. When reading the time and date registers, the user buffers are synchronized to the \ninternal registers on any  start or stop and when the register pointer rolls over to zero. The countdown chain is reset \nwhenever the seconds register is written. Write transfers occur on the acknowledge from the DS1338. Once the LOCAL GROUND PLANE (LAYER 2)  \nCRYSTAL  X1 \nX2 \nGND \nNOTE: AVOID ROUTING SIGNALS IN THE CROSSHATCHED \nAREA (UPPER LEFT -HAND QUADRANT) OF THE PACKAGE \nUNLESS THERE IS A GROUND PLANE BETWEEN THE SIGNAL \nLINE AND THE PACKAGE.  \nDS133 8 \n \n10 of 16 countdown chain is reset, to avoid rollover issues the remaining time and date registers must be written within  \n1 second. The 1Hz square- wave output, if enabled, transitions high 500ms after the seconds data transfer, \nprovided the oscillator is already running.  \n \nThe DS1338 runs in either 12- hour or 24- hour mode. Bit 6 of the hours register is defined as the 12- hour or 24- hour \nmode- select bit. When high, the 12- hour mode is selected. In the 12- hour mode, bit 5 is the AM/PM bit, with logic \nhigh being PM. In the 24- hour mode, bit 5 is the 2 0-hour bit (20 –23 hours). If the 12/ 24-hour mode select is \nchanged, the hours register must be re- initialized to the new format.  \n \nOn an I2C START, the current time is transferred to a second set of registers. The time information is read from \nthese secondary registers, while t he clock continues to run. This eliminates the need to re- read the registers in \ncase of an update of the main registers during a read.  \n \nTable 3.

Controls the output level of the SQW/OUT pin when the square- wave output is \ndisabled. If SQWE = 0, the l ogic level on the SQW/OUT pin is 1 if OUT = 1; it is 0 if OUT = 0.  \n Bit 5: Oscillator Stop Flag (OSF).  A logic 1 in this bit indicates that the oscillator has stopped or was stopped for \nsome time period and can be used to judge the validity of the clock and calendar data. This bit is edge triggered, \nand is set to logic 1 when the internal circuitry senses the oscillator has transitioned from a normal run state to a \nSTOP condition. The following are examples of conditions that may cause the OSF bit to be set : \n1) The first time power is applied.  \n2) The voltage present on V\nCC and V BAT are insufficient to support oscillation.  \n3) The CH bit is set to 1, disabling the oscillator.  \n4) External influences on the crystal (i.e., noise, leakage, etc.).  \n \nThis bit remains at logic 1 until written to logic 0. This bit can only be written to logic 0. Attempting to write OSF to \nlogic 1 leaves the value unchanged.  \n \nBit 4: Square -Wave Enable (SQWE). When set to logic 1, this bit enables the oscillator output to operate with \neither V CC or V BAT applied. The frequency of the square- wave output depends upon the value of the RS0 and RS1 \nbits. \n Bits 1 and 0: Rate Select (RS1 and RS0). These bits control the frequency of the square- wave output when the \nsquare- wave output has been enabled.

A device that sends data onto the bus is defined as a transmitter and a \ndevice receiving data is a receiver. The device that controls the message is called a master. The devices that are \ncontrolled by the master are referred to as s laves. The bus must be controlled by a master device, which generates \nthe serial clock (SCL), controls the bus access, and generates the START and STOP conditions. The DS1338 operates as a slave on the I\n2C bus. Within the bus specifications, a standard mode (100kHz maximum clock rate) \nand a fast mode (400kHz maximum clock rate) are defined. The DS1338 works in both modes. Connections to the \nbus are made through the open- drain I/O lines SDA and SCL.  \n The following bus protocol has been defined ( Figure 5). \n \uf0a7 Data transfer can be initiated only when the bus is not busy.  \n\uf0a7 During data transfer, the data line must remain stable whenever the clock line is HIGH. Changes in the data \nline while the clock line is HIGH are interpreted as control signals.  \nAccordingly, the following bus conditions have been defined:  \nBus not busy: Both data and clock lines remain HIGH.  \nStart data transfer: A change in the state of the data line, from HIGH to LOW, while the clock is HIGH, defines a \nSTART condition.  \nStop data transfer: A change in the state of the data line, from LOW to HIGH, while the clock line is HIGH, defines \nthe STOP condition.  \nData valid: The state of the data line represents valid data when, after a START condition, the data line is stable \nfor the duration of the HIGH period of the clock signal. The data on the line must be changed during the LOW period of the clock signal. There is one clock pulse per bit of data.  \nEach data transfer is initiated with a START condition and terminated with a STOP c ondition. The number of data \nbytes transferred between START and STOP conditions is not limited and is determined by the master device. The \ninformation is transferred byte- wise and each receiver acknowledges with a ninth bit.  \nAcknowledge: Each receiving device, when addressed, is obliged to generate an acknowledge after the reception \nof each byte. The master device must generate an extra clock pulse that is associated with this acknowledge bit.  \nA device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during t he acknowledge clock pulse in such a way that \nthe SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge- related clock pulse. Of course, setup and \nhold times must be taken into account. A master must signal an end of data to the slave by not generating an \nacknowledge bit on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this case, the slave must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate the STOP condition.  \n \n \nFigure 5. Data Transfer on I2C Serial Bus  \n \n \n \n \nDS133 8 \n \n13 of 16 Depending upon the state of the R/ W bit, two types of data transfer are possible:  \n \n1) Data transfer from a master transmitter to a slave receiver. The master transmits the first byte (the slave \naddress). Next follows a number of data bytes. The slave returns an acknowledge bit after each received byte. \nData is transferred with the most significant bit (MSB) first.  \n \n2) Data transfer from a slave transmitter to a master receiver. The master transmits the first byte (the slave \naddress). The slave then retur ns an acknowledge bit, which is followed by the slave transmitting a number of \ndata bytes. The master returns an acknowledge bit after all received bytes other than the last byte. At the end \nof the last received byte, a “not acknowledge” is returned. The m aster device generates all of the serial clock \npulses and the START and STOP conditions. A transfer is ended with a STOP condition or with a repeated \nSTART condition. Since a repeated START condition is also the beginning of the next serial transfer, the bus is \nnot released. Data is transferred with the most significant bit (MSB) first.  \n \nThe DS1338 can operate in the following two modes:  \n \n1) Slave receiver mode (write mode): Serial data and clock are received through SDA and SCL. An \nacknowledge bit is transmit ted after each byte is received. START and STOP conditions are recognized as the \nbeginning and end of a serial transfer. Hardware performs address recognition after reception of the slave \naddress and direction bit ( Figure 6). The slave address byte is the first byte received after the master \ngenerates the START condition. The slave address byte contains the 7- bit DS1338 address —1101000 —\nfollowed by the direction bit (R/ W), which, for a write, is 0. After receiving and decoding the s lave address byte, \nthe slave outputs an acknowledge on the SDA line. After the DS1338 acknowledges the slave address and \nwrite bit, the master transmits a register address to the DS1338. This sets the register pointer on the DS1338, \nwith DS1338 acknowledgi ng the transfer. The master may then transmit zero or more bytes of data, with the \nDS1338 acknowledging each byte received. The register pointer increments after each data byte is transferred. \nThe master generates a STOP condition to terminate the data wri te. \n \n2) Slave transmitter mode (read mode): The first byte is received and handled as in the slave receiver mode. \nHowever, in this mode, the direction bit indicates that the transfer direction is reversed. The DS1338 transmits \nserial data on SDA while the ser ial clock is input on SCL. START and STOP conditions are recognized as the \nbeginning and end of a serial transfer ( Figure 7). The slave address byte is the first byte received after the \nmaster generates the START condition. The sl ave address byte contains the 7- bit DS1338 address —\n1101000 —followed by the direction bit (R/ W), which, for a read, is 1. After receiving and decoding the slave \naddress byte, the slave outputs an acknowledge on the SDA line. The DS1338 then starts transmitt ing data \nusing the register address pointed to by the register pointer. If the register pointer is not set before the initiation \nof a read mode, the first address that is read is the last one stored in the register pointer. The register pointer is \nincremented after each byte is transferred. The DS1338 must receive a “not acknowledge” to end a read.  \nDS133 8 \n \n14 of 16 Figure 6.
