As a result, the heat stress to the components, even in wave soldering, has increased considerably due to higher pre-heat and wave temperatures. Polypropylene capacitors are especially sensitive to heat (the melting point of polypropylene is 160 – 170ºC). Wave soldering can be destructive, especially for mechanically small polypropylene capacitors (with lead spacing of 5 – 15 mm), and\n\tgreat\tcare\tmust\tbe\ttaken\tduring\tsoldering. \tThe\trecommended \tsolder\tprofiles\tfrom\tKEMET\tshould\tbe\tused.\tConsult\tKEMET\t\nwith any questions.
