Document No. DOC -81482- 2   │ UltraCMOS® RFIC Solutions  E\nlectrostatic Discharge (ESD) Precautions  \nWhen handling this UltraCMOS device, observe \nthe same precautions that you would use with \nother ESD -sensitive devices. Although this device \ncontains circuitry to protect it from damage due to \nESD, precautions should be taken to avoid \nexceeding the rate specified.  \nLatch -Up Avoidance \nUnlike conventional CMOS devices, UltraCMOS \ndevices are immune to latch -up.  \nSwitching Frequency  \nThe PE4312 has a maximum 25 kHz switching \nrate in normal mode (pin 12 = GND). A faster \nswitching rate is available in bypass mode (pin 12 \n= V SS_EXT ). The rate at which the PE4312 can be \nsw\nitched is then limited to the switching time as \nspecified in Table 1 . \nSwitching frequency describes the time duration \nbetween switching events. Switching time is the \ntime duration between the point the control signal \nreaches 50% of the final value and the point the \noutput signal reaches within 10% or 90% of its \ntarget value.  Resistor on Pin 1 & 3  \nA 10 kΩ resistor on the inputs to pin 1 and 3 (see \nFigure 26) will eliminate package resonance \nbetween the RF input pin and the two digital \ninputs. Specified attenuation error versus \nfrequency performance is dependent upon this \ncondition.  \nMoisture Sensitivity Level  \nThe moisture sensitivity level rating for the \nPE4312 in the 4 × 4 mm QFN package is MSL1.  \nSpurious Performance  \nThe typical low -frequency spurious performance \nof the PE4312 in normal mode is –140 dBm \n(pin 12 = GND). If spur -free performance is \ndesired, the internal negative voltage generator \ncan be disabled by applying a negative voltage to \nVSS_EXT  (pin 12).  S\nafe Attenuation State Transitions  \nThe PE4312 features a novel architecture to \nprovide safe transition behavior when changing \nattenuation states. When RF input power is \napplied, positive output power spikes are \nprevented during attenuation state changes by \noptimized internal timing control.  \nFigure 4.

All rights reserved.  Programming Options  \nParallel/Serial Selection  \nEither a parallel or serial interface can be used to \ncontrol the PE4312. The P/S bit provides this \nselection, with P/S = LOW selecting the parallel \ninterface and P/S = HIGH selecting the serial \ninterface.  \n \nParallel Mode Interface  \nThe parallel interface consists of six CMOS -\ncompatible control lines that select the desired \nattenuation state, as shown in Table 5.  \n \nThe parallel interface timing requirements are \ndefined by Figure 5 (Parallel Interface Timing \nDiagram), Table  9 (Parallel Interface AC \nCharacteristics), and switching speed ( Table 1 ). \n \nFor latched  parallel programming the Latch Enable \n(LE) should be held LOW while changing attenuation \nstate control values, then pulse LE HIGH to LOW \n(per Figure 5) to latch the new attenuation state into \nthe device.  \n \nFor direct  parallel programming, the Latch Enable \n(LE) line should be pulled HIGH. Changing \nattenuation state control values will change device \nstate to new attenuation. Direct Mode is ideal for \nmanual control of the device (using hardwire, \nswitches, or jumpers).  \nP/S C16 C8 C4 C2 C1 C0.5  Attenuation State  \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Reference Loss  \n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0.5 dB  \n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 dB \n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 dB \n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 dB \n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 8 dB \n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 16 dB  \n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 31.5 dB  Table 5. Truth Table*  \nNote: * Not all 64 possible combinations of C0.5–C16 are shown in table.  \nSerial Interface  \nThe serial interface is a 6 -bit serial -in, parallel -out \nshift register buffered by a transparent latch. It is \ncontrolled by three CMOS -compatible signals : Data, Clock, and Latch Enable (LE). The Data and Clock \ninputs allow data to be serially entered into the shift \nregister, a process that is independent of the state of \nthe LE input.  \n \nThe LE input controls the latch. When LE is HIGH, \nthe latch is transparent and the contents of the serial \nshift register control the attenuator. When LE is \nbrought LOW, data in the shift register is latched.  \n \nThe shift register should be loaded while LE is held \nLOW to prevent the attenuator value from changing \nas data is entered. The LE input should then be \ntoggled HIGH and brought LOW again, latching the \nnew data. The timing for this operation is defined by \nFigure 5 (Serial Interface Timing Diagram) and \nTable  8 (Serial Interface AC Characteristics).  \n \nPower -up Control Settings  \nThe PE4312 always assumes a specifiable \nattenuation setting on power -up. This feature exists \nfor both the Serial and Parallel modes of operation, \nand allows a known attenuation state to be \nestablished before an initial serial or parallel control \nword is provided.  \n \nWhen the attenuator powers up in Serial mode  \n(P/S = 1), the six control bits are set to whatever \ndata is present on the six parallel data inputs (C0.5 \nto C16). This allows any one of the 64 attenuation \nsettings to be specified as the power -up state.  \n \nWhen the attenuator powers up in Parallel mode  \n(P/S = 0) with LE = 0, the control bits are \nautomatically set to one of four possible values. \nThese four values are selected by the two power -up \ncontrol bits, PUP1 and PUP2, as shown in Table 6 \n(Power -Up Truth Table, Parallel Mode).  \nP/S LE PUP2  PUP1  Attenuation State  \n0 0 0 0 Reference Loss \n0 0 1 0 8 dB \n0 0 0 1 16 dB  \n0 0 1 1 31.5 dB  \n0 1 X X Defined by C0.5 -C16 Table 6.

Evaluation Board Layout  \nPRT-10505  Evaluation Kit  \nThe Digital Step Attenuator Evaluation Board \n(EVB) was designed to ease customer evaluation \nof the PE4312 Digital Step Attenuator. PE4312 \nEVB supports Direct Parallel, Latched Parallel, and \nSerial programming modes.  \n \nEvaluation Kit Setup  \nConnect the EVB with the USB dongle board and \nUSB cable as shown in Figure 24 . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirect Parallel Programming Procedure  \nDirect Parallel programming is suitable for manual \noperation without software programming. For \nmanual Direct Parallel programming, position the \nParallel/Serial (P/S) select switch to the Parallel (or \nleft) position. The LE mechanical programming \nswitch must be set to the HIGH position. Switches \nD1–D6 are SP3T switches that enable the user to \nmanually program the parallel bits. When D1–D6 \nare toggled to the HIGH position, logic high is \npresented to the parallel input. When toggled to the \nLOW position, logic low is presented to the parallel \ninput. Setting D1–D6 to the EXTERNAL position \npresents as OPEN, which is set for software \nprogramming of Latched Parallel and Serial mode. \nTable 5 depicts the parallel programming truth \ntable.  Latched Parallel Programming Procedure  \nFor automated Latched Parallel programming, \nconnect the USB dongle board and cable that is \nprovided with the Evaluation Kit (EVK) from the \nUSB port of the PC to the J1 header of the \nPE4312 EVB, and set the D1–D6 SP3T switches \nto the EXTERNAL position. Position the Parallel/\nSerial (P/S) select switch to the Parallel (or left) \nposition. The evaluation software is written to \noperate the DSA in Parallel mode. Ensure that the \nsoftware GUI is set to Latched Parallel mode. Use \nthe software GUI to enable the desired attenuation \nstate. The software GUI automatically programs \nthe DSA each time an attenuation state is \nenabled.  \n \nSerial Programming Procedure \nFor automated Serial programming, connect the \nUSB dongle board and cable that is provided with \nthe Evaluation Kit (EVK) from the USB port of the \nPC to the J1 header of the PE4312 EVB, and set \nthe D1–D6 SP3T switches to the EXTERNAL \nposition. Position the Parallel/Serial (P/S) select \nswitch to the Serial (or right) position. The \nevaluation software is written to operate the DSA \nin Serial mode. Ensure that the software GUI is \nset to Serial mode. Use the software GUI to \nenable the desired attenuation state. The software \nGUI automatically programs the DSA each time \nan attenuation state is enabled.  Figure 24.
