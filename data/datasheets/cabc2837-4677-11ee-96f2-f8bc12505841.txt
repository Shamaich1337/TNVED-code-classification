A | Page 8 of 16 TERMINOLOGY  \nIntegral Nonlinearity Error (INL) \nLinearity error refers to the deviation of each individual code \nfrom a line drawn from negative full scale through positive full scale. The point used as negative full scale occurs ½ LSB before the first code transition. Positive full scale is defined as a level 1½ LSB beyond the last code transition. The deviation is \nmeasured from the middle of each code to the true straight line \n(see \nFigure 21 ). \nDifferential Nonlinearity Error (DNL) \nIn an ideal ADC, code transitions are 1 LSB apart. DNL is the \nmaximum deviation from this ideal value. It is often specified in \nterms of resolution for which no missing codes are guaranteed. \nZero Error \nZero error is the difference between the ideal midscale voltage, \nthat is, 0 V , and the actual voltage producing the midscale output code, that is, 0 LSB. \nGain Error \nThe first transition (from 100 . . . 00 to 100 . . . 01) should  occur at a level ½ LSB above the nominal negative full scale (−4.999924 V for the ±5 V range). The last transition (from 011…10 to 011…11) should occur for an analog voltage 1½ LSB below the nominal full scale (4.999771 V for the ±5 V \nrange). The gain error is the deviation of the difference between \nthe actual level of the last transition and the actual level of the \nfirst transition from the difference between the ideal levels. \nSpurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) \nSFDR is the difference, in decibels (dB), between the rms \namplitude of the input signal and the peak spurious signal. Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) \nENOB is a measurement of the resolution with a sine wave \ninput. It is related to SINAD by the following formula \nENOB  = (SINAD dB − 1.76)/6.02 \nand is expressed in bits. \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD) \nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of the first five harmonic \ncomponents to the rms value of a full-scale input signal and is expressed in dB. \nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) \nSNR is the ratio of the rms value of the actual input signal to the rms sum of all other spectral components below the Nyquist frequency, excluding harmonics and dc. The value for SNR is \nexpressed in dB. \nSignal-to-(Noise + Distortion) Ratio (SINAD) \nSINAD is the ratio of the rms value of the actual input signal to \nthe rms sum of all other spectral components below the Nyquist \nfrequency, including harmonics but excluding dc. The value for \nSINAD is expressed in dB. \nAperture Delay \nAperture delay is a measure of the acquisition performance and \nis the time between the falling edge of the CS input and when \nthe input signal is held for a conversion. \nTransient Response \nTransient response is the time required for the ADC to accurately acquire its input after a full-scale step function is applied. \n \n   AD7684\n \nRev.

ADC Simplified Schematic \nCIRCUIT INFORMATION \nThe AD7684 is a low power, single-supply, 16-bit ADC using a \nsuccessive approximation architecture. It is capable of converting \n100,000 samples per second (100 kSPS) and powers down between conversions. When operating at 10 kSPS, for example, \nit consumes typically 150 μW with a 2.7 V supply, ideal for \nbattery-powered applications.  \nThe AD7684 provides the user with an on-chip, track-and-hold \nand does not exhibit any pipeline delay or latency, making it \nideal for multiple, multiplexed channel applications. \nThe AD7684 is specified from 2.7 V to 5.5 V . It is housed in an  8-lead MSOP . \nCONVERTER OPERATION \nThe AD7684 is a successive approximation ADC based on a \ncharge redistribution DAC. Figure 20  shows the simplified \nschematic of the ADC. The capacitive DAC consists of two \nidentical arrays of 16 binary-weighted capacitors, which are connected to the two comparator inputs. \nDuring the acquisition phase, terminals of the array tied to the \ninput of the comparator are connected to GND via SW+ and \nSW−. All independent switches are connected to the analog inputs. Therefore, the capacitor arrays are used as sampling capacitors and acquire the analog signal on the +IN and −IN \ninputs. When the acquisition phase is complete and the \nCS \ninput goes low, a conversion phase is initiated. When the \nconversion phase begins, SW+ and SW− are opened first. The \ntwo capacitor arrays are then disconnected from the inputs and \nconnected to the GND input. Therefore, the differential voltage between the inputs, +IN and −IN, captured at the end of the acquisition phase is applied to the comparator inputs, causing the comparator to become un balanced. By switching each \nelement of the capacitor array between GND and REF, the \ncomparator input varies by binary-weighted voltage steps \n(V\nREF/2, V REF/4...V REF/65,536). The control logic toggles these \nswitches, starting with the MSB, to bring the comparator back into a balanced condition. After the completion of this process, the part returns to the acquisition phase and the control logic \ngenerates the ADC output code. \nTRANSFER FUNCTIONS \nThe ideal transfer function for the AD7684 is shown in  \nFigure 21  and Table 8 .  \n100...000100...001100...010011...101011...110011...111ADC CODE (TWOS COMPLEMENT)\nANALOG INPUT+FSR – 1.5 LSB+FSR – 1 LSB–FSR + 1 LSB –FSR\n–FSR + 0.5 LSB\n04302-021 \nFigure 21.

Typical Application Diagram  \n \nTYPICAL CONNECTION DIAGRAM \nFigure 22  shows an example of the recommended application \ndiagram for the AD7684. \nANALOG INPUTS \nThe analog inputs (+IN, −IN) need to be driven differentially \n180° from each other, as shown in Figure 22 . Holding either \ninput at GND or a fixed dc gives erroneous conversion results \nbecause the AD7684 is intended for differential operation only. For applications requiring –IN to be at GND (±100 mV), the \nAD7683 should be used.  \nFigure 23  shows an equivalent circuit of the input structure of \nthe AD7684. The two diodes, D1 and D2, provide ESD protection for the analog inputs, +IN and −IN. Care must be taken to ensure that the analog input signal never exceeds the supply rails by more than 0.3 V because this causes these diodes to become forward-biased and start conducting current. However, \nthese diodes can handle a forward-biased current of 130 mA \nmaximum. For instance, these conditions could eventually occur when the supplies of the input buffer (U1) are different from VDD. In such a case, an input buffer with a short-circuit \ncurrent limitation can be used to protect the part. \n04302-023CIN RIND1\nD2 CPIN+IN\nOR –IN\nGNDVDD\n \nFigure 23. Equivalent Analog Input Circuit  \nThis analog input structure allows the sampling of the differential \nsignal between +IN and −IN. By using this differential input, small \nsignals common to both inputs are rejected. During the acquisition \nphase, the impedance of the analog inputs can be modeled as a parallel combination of the Capacitor C\nPIN and the network \nformed by the series connection of R IN and C IN. C PIN is primarily the pin capacitance. R IN is typically 600 Ω and is a lumped \ncomponent made up of some serial resistors and the on-resistance of the switches. C\nIN is typically 30 pF and is mainly \nthe ADC sampling capacitor. During the conversion phase, when the switches are opened, the input impedance is limited  \nto C\nPIN. R IN and C IN make a 1-pole, low-pass filter that reduces \nundesirable aliasing effects and limits the noise. \nWhen the source impedance of the driving circuit is low, the \nAD7684 can be driven directly. Large source impedances significantly affect the ac performance, especially THD. The dc \nperformances are less sensitive to the input impedance.  \nDRIVER AMPLIFIER CHOICE \nAlthough the AD7684 is easy to drive, the driver amplifier \nneeds to meet the following requirements: \n• The noise generated by the driver amplifier needs to be kept as low as possible to preserve the SNR and transition noise performance of the AD7684. Note that the AD7684 \nhas a noise level much lower than most other 16-bit ADCs \nand, therefore, can be driven by a noisier op amp while preserving the same or better system performance. The noise coming from the driver is filtered by the AD7684 analog input circuit 1-pole, low-pass filter made by R\nIN and \nCIN or by the external filter, if one is used. \n• For ac applications, the driver needs to have a THD \nperformance commensurate with the AD7684. Figure 15  \nshows the THD vs. frequency that the driver should exceed. \n• For multichannel multiplexed applications, the driver \namplifier and the AD7684 analog input circuit must be able to settle for a full-scale step of the capacitor array at a  16-bit level (0.0015%). In the data sheet of the amplifier, settling at 0.1% to 0.01% is more commonly specified. This \ncould differ significantly from the settling time at a 16-bit \nlevel and should be verified prior to driver selection. \nAD7684  \n \nRev. A | Page 14 of 16 Table 9.

It should therefore be driven by a low impedance \nsource with efficient decoupling between the REF and GND \npins, as explained in more detail in the Layout  section. \nWhen REF is driven by a very low impedance source (for \nexample, an unbuffered reference voltage such as the low \ntemperature drift ADR43x  reference or a reference buffer using \nthe AD8031  or the AD8605 ), a 10 μF (X5R, 0805 size) ceramic \nchip capacitor is appropriate for optimum performance. \nIf desired, smaller reference decoupling capacitor values down to 2.2 μF can be used with minimal impact on performance, \nespecially DNL. \nPOWER SUPPLY \nThe AD7684 powers down automatically at the end of each \nconversion phase and therefore the power scales linearly with the sampling rate, as shown in \nFigure 24 . This makes the part \nideal for low sampling rates (even of a few Hz) and low battery \npowered applications.  \n0.010.11101001000\n100 10 1k 10k 100k\nSAMPLING RATE (SPS)OPERATING CURRENT ( μA)\n04302-024VDD = 5V\nVDD = 2.7V\n \nFigure 24. Operating Current vs. Sampling Rate \nDIGITAL INTERFACE \nThe AD7684 is compatible with SPI, QSPI, digital hosts, and \nDSPs (for example, Blackfin® ADSP-BF53x or ADSP-219x). The \nconnection diagram is shown in Figure 25 , and the corresponding \ntiming is given in Figure 2 . A falling edge on CS initiates a conversion and the data transfer. \nAfter the fifth DCLOCK falling edge, D OUT is enabled and forced \nlow. The data bits are then clocked MSB first by subsequent DCLOCK falling edges. The data is valid on both DCLOCK edges. Although the rising edge can be used to capture the data, a digital host also using the DCLOCK falling edge allows a faster reading rate, provided it has an acceptable hold time.  \n04302-025CS\nDCLOCKDOUT DATA IN\nCLKCONVERT\nDIGITAL HOST\nAD7684\n \nFigure 25. Connection Diagram \nLAYOUT \nThe printed circuit board housing the AD7684 should be \ndesigned so that the analog and digital sections are separated \nand confined to certain areas of the board. The pinout of the \nAD7684 with all its analog signals on the left side and all its \ndigital signals on the right side eases this task.  \nAvoid running digital lines under the device because these couple \nnoise onto the die, unless a ground plane under the AD7684 is \nused as a shield. Fast switching signals, such as CS or clocks, \nshould never run near analog signal paths. Crossover of digital \nand analog signals should be avoided. \nAt least one ground plane should be used. It could be common \nor split between the digital and analog sections. In such a case, \nit should be joined underneath the AD7684. \nThe AD7684 voltage reference input REF has a dynamic input \nimpedance and should be decoupled with minimal parasitic inductances. This is done by placing the reference decoupling \nceramic capacitor close to, and ideally right up against, the REF \nand GND pins and by connecting these pins with wide, low \nimpedance traces. \nFinally, the power supply, VDD, of the AD7684 should be \ndecoupled with a ceramic capacitor, typically 100 nF, and placed close to the AD7684. It should be connected using short and large traces to provide low impedance paths and reduce the effect of glitches on the power supply lines.  \nEVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AD7684 \nOther recommended layouts for the AD7684 are outlined in the \nevaluation board for the AD7684 ( EV AL-AD7684 CBZ ).
