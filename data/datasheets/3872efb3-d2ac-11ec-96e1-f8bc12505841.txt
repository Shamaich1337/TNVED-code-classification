Outputs are stable with ca pacitive loads of over 1000 pF \nwith no external compensation. Su pply current is less than 500 μA \nper amplifier at 30 V. Internal 5 00 Ω series resistors protect the \ninputs, allowing input signal levels several volts beyond either supply without phase reversal. \nUnlike previous high voltage amplifiers with very low offset \nvoltages, the OP1177 (single) and OP2177 (dual) amplifiers are available in tiny 8-lead surface-mount MSOP and 8-lead narrow SOIC packages. The OP4177 (quad) is available in TSSOP and 14-lead narrow SOIC packages. Moreover, specified \nperformance in the MSOP and the TSSOP is identical to performance in the SOIC package. MSOP and TSSOP are \navailable in tape and reel only. \nThe OPx177 family offers the widest specified temperature \nrange of any high precision amplifier in surface-mount packaging. \nAll versions are fully specifie d for operation from −40°C to \n+125°C for the most demandin g operating environments. \nApplications for these amplifiers include precision diode power measurement, voltage and current level setting, and level detection in optical and wireless transmission systems. \nAdditional applications include line-powered and portable \ninstrumentation and controls—thermocouple, RTD, strain-bridge, and other sensor signal conditioning—and precision filters. \n \nOP1177 /OP2177/ OP4177  Data Sheet\n \nRev.

I | Page 14 of 24 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION \nThe OPx177 series is the fourth generation of Analog Devices, \nInc., industry-standard OP07 amplifier family. OPx177 is a high precision, low noise operational amplifier with a combination of extremely low offset voltage and very low input bias currents. Unlike JFET amplifiers, the low bias and offset currents are relatively insensitive to ambient temperatures, \neven up to 125°C. \nAnalog Devices proprietary process technology and linear design \nexpertise has produced a high vo ltage amplifier with superior \nperformance to the OP07 , OP77 , and OP177 in a tiny MSOP \n8\xadlead package. Despite its small size, the OPx177 offers numerous \nimprovements, including low wideband noise, very wide input \nand output voltage range, lower input bias current, and \ncomplete freedom from phase inversion. \nOPx177 has a specified operating temperature range as wide as \nany similar device in a plastic surface-mount package. This is \nincreasingly important as PCB an d overall system sizes continue \nto shrink, causing internal system temperatures to rise. Power consumption is reduced by a fa ctor of four from the OP177, \nand bandwidth and slew rate increase by a factor of two. The \nlow power dissipation and very stable performance vs. \ntemperature also act to redu ce warmup drift errors to \ninsignificant levels. \nOpen-loop gain linearity under heav y loads is superior to compet-\nitive parts, such as the OPA 277, improving dc accuracy and \nreducing distortion in circuits  with high closed-loop gains. \nInputs are internally protecte d from overvoltage conditions \nreferenced to either supply rail. \nLike any high performance amplifier, maximum performance is \nachieved by following appropriate circuit and PCB guidelines. \nThe following sections provide practical advice on getting the most out of the OPx177 under a variety of application conditions. \nTOTAL NOISE-INCLUDING SOURCE RESISTORS \nThe low input current noise and input bias current of the OPx177 make it useful for circuits with substantial input source resistance. \nInput offset voltage increases by less than 1 μV maximum per 500 Ω of source resistance. \nThe total noise density of the OPx177 is \n\uf028\uf029S Sn n TOTAL n kTR R i e e42  2\n, \uf02b \uf02b \uf03d  \nwhere: \nen is the input voltage noise density. \nin is the input current noise density. \nRS is the source resistance at the noninverting terminal. \nk is Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 × 10−23 J/K). \nT is the ambient temperature in Kelvin ( T = 273 + temperature \nin degrees Celsius). \n For R S < 3.9 kΩ, e n dominates and \nen,TOTAL  ≈ en \nFor 3.9 kΩ < R S < 412 kΩ, voltage noise of the amplifier, the \ncurrent noise of the amplifier translated through the source \nresistor, and the thermal noise from the source resistor all \ncontribute to the total noise. \nFor R S > 412 kΩ, the current noise dominates and \nen,TOTAL  ≈ inRS \nThe total equivalent rms noise over a specific bandwidth is \nexpressed as \n\uf028\uf029BW e eTOTAL n n     ,\uf03d  \nwhere BW is the bandwidth in hertz. \nThe preceding analysis is valid for frequencies larger than 50 Hz. \nWhen considering lower frequencie s, flicker noise (also known as \n1/f noise) must be taken into account. \nFor a reference on noise calcul ations, refer to the Band-Pass \nKRC or Sallen-Key Filter section. \nGAIN LINEARITY \nGain linearity reduces errors in closed-loop configurations. The \nstraighter the gain curve, the lower the maximum error over the input signal range. This is especially true for circuits with high closed-loop gains. \nThe OP1177 has excellent gain line arity even with heavy loads, \nas shown in Figure 51. Compare its performance to the OPA277, \nshown in Figure 52. Both device s are measured under identical \nconditions, with R\nL = 2 kΩ. The OP2177 (dual) has virtually no \ndistortion at lower voltages . Compared to the OPA277 at \nseveral supply voltages and various loads, OP1177 performance far exceeds that of its counterpart. \n(5V/DIV)OP1177(10µV/DIV)VSY = ±15V\nRL = 2kΩ\n02627-051 \nFigure 51.

Gain Linearity \nINPUT OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION \nWhen input voltages exceed the positive or negative supply \nvoltage, most amplifiers requir e external resistors to protect \nthem from damage. \nThe OPx177 has internal protective circuitry that allows voltages as \nhigh as 2.5 V beyond the supplies to be applied at the input of \neither terminal without any harmful effects. \nUse an additional resistor in seri es with the inputs if the voltage \nexceeds the supplies by more than 2.5 V. The value of the resistor \ncan be determined from the formula \n\uf028\uf029    5 mA500 IN S\nSVV\nR\uf02d\uf0a3\uf02b\uf057 \nWith the OPx177 low input offset current of <1 nA maximum, \nplacing a 5 kΩ resistor in series with both inputs adds less than \n5 μV to input offset voltage and has a negligible impact on the overall noise performance of the circuit. \n5 kΩ protects the inputs to more than 27 V beyond either supply. \nRefer to the THD + Noise section for additional information on noise vs. source resistance. \nOUTPUT PHASE REVERSAL \nPhase reversal is defined as a chan ge of polarity in the amplifier \ntransfer function. Many operat ional amplifiers exhibit phase \nreversal when the voltage applied to the input is greater than \nthe maximum common-mode voltage. In some instances, this \ncan cause permanent damage to the amplifier. In feedback loops, it can result in system lockups or equipment damage. The OPx177 is immune to phase reversal problems even at input voltages beyond the supplies. VSY=10V\nAV= 1\nTIME (400µs/DIV)VIN\nVOUTVOLTAGE (5V/DIV)\n02627-053 \nFigure 53. No Phase Reversal \nSETTLING TIME \nSettling time is defined as the time it takes an amplifier output to reach and remain within a perc entage of its final value after \napplication of an input pulse. It is especially important in measure-\nment and control circuits in which amplifiers buffer ADC inputs or DAC outputs. \nTo minimize settling time in amplifier circuits, use proper \nbypassing of power supplies an d an appropriate choice of \ncircuit components. Resistors sh ould be metal film types, \nbecause they have less stray capacitance and inductance than their wire-wound counterparts. Capacitors should be polystyrene or polycarbonate ty pes to minimize dielectric \nabsorption. \nThe leads from the power supply should be kept as short as \npossible to minimize capacitance and inductance. The OPx177 \nhas a settling time of about 45 μs to 0.01% (1 mV) with a 10 V \nstep applied to the input in a noninverting unity gain. \nOVERLOAD RECOVERY TIME \nOverload recovery is defined as the time it takes the output \nvoltage of an amplifier to recover from a saturated condition to its linear response region. A common example is one in which the output voltage demanded by the transfer function of the circuit lies beyond the maximum output voltage capability of the amplifier. A 10 V input applied to an amplifier in a closed-loop gain of 2 demands an output voltage of 20 V. This is \nbeyond the output voltage range of the OPx177 when operating \nat ±15 V supplies and forces the output into saturation. \nRecovery time is important in many applications, particularly \nwhere the operational amplifier must amplify small signals in the presence of large transient voltages. \n \nOP1177 /OP2177/ OP4177  Data Sheet\n \nRev.

THD + N vs. Frequency \nCAPACITIVE LOAD DRIVE \nOPx177 is inherently stable at all gains and capable of driving \nlarge capacitive loads without os cillation. With no external \ncompensation, the OPx177 safely dr ives capacitive loads up to \n1000 pF in any configuration. As with virtually any amplifier, \ndriving larger capacitive loads in unity gain requires additional circuitry to assure stability. \nIn this case, a snubber network is used to prevent oscillation \nand reduce the amount of oversh oot. A significant advantage of \nthis method is that it does not reduce the output swing because the Resistor R\nS is not inside the feedback loop. Figure 56 is a scope shot of the output of the OPx177 in response to a 400 mV pulse. Th e load capacitance is 2 nF. The \ncircuit is configured in positi ve unity gain, the worst-case \ncondition for stability. \nAs shown in Figure 58, placing an R-C network parallel to the \nload capacitance (C\nL) allows the amplifier to drive higher values \nof C L without causing oscillation  or excessive overshoot. \nThere is no ringing, and overshoot is reduced from 27% to 5% \nusing the snubber network. \nOptimum values for R S and C S are tabulated in Table 5 for \nseveral capacitive loads, up to 20 0 nF. Values for other capacitive \nloads can be determined experimentally. \nTable 5.

These are the internal \ndifferential capacitance between the input terminals, the internal common-mode capacitance of each input to ground, and the external capacitance including parasitic capacitance. In the circuit in Figure 59, the closed-l oop gain increases as the signal \nfrequency increases. \nThe transfer function of the circuit is \n\uf028\uf029 R1 sCR1R2\nt\uf02b \uf02b1    1  \nindicating a zero at \n\uf028\uf029t t C R2 R1 R2R1CR1 R2s /  21        \uf070\uf03d\uf02b\uf03d  \nDepending on the value of R1 and R2, the cutoff frequency of \nthe closed-loop gain can be well  below the crossover frequency. \nIn this case, the phase margin (Φ M) can be severely degraded, \nresulting in excessive ringing or even oscillation. \nA simple way to overcome this problem is to insert a capacitor \nin the feedback path, as  shown in Figure 60. \nThe resulting pole can be positioned to adjust the phase margin. \nSetting C\nf = (R1/R2) C t achieves a phase margin of 90°. \nR2 R1\nV1+\n–OP11772\n3VOUT Ct\n02627-05967\n4V+\nV–  \nFigure 59.

Compensation Using Feedback Capacitor \nREDUCING ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE \nA number of methods can be utilized to reduce the effects of \nEMI on amplifier circuits. \nIn one method, stray signals on either input are coupled to the \nopposite input of the amplifier. The result is that the signal is \nrejected according to the CMRR of the amplifier. \nThis is usually achieved by inserting a capacitor between the inputs \nof the amplifier, as shown in Figure 61. However, this method can \nalso cause instability, depending on the value of capacitance. \nR2 R1\nV1+\n–OP11772\n3VOUT C\n02627-06167\n4V+\nV–  \nFigure 61.

To ensure optimum \nperformance at the PCB level, care must be taken in the design \nof the board layout. \nTo avoid leakage currents, the surface of the board should be \nkept clean and free of moisture. Coating the surface creates a barrier to moisture accumulati on and helps reduce parasitic \nresistance on the board. \nKeeping supply traces short and properly bypassing the power \nsupplies minimizes power supply disturbances due to output \ncurrent variation, such as when driving an ac signal into a heavy load. Bypass capacitors should be connected as closely as possible to the device supply pins. Stray capacitances are a concern at the outputs and the inputs of the amplifier. It is \nrecommended that signal traces be kept at least 5 mm from \nsupply lines to minimize coupling. \nA variation in temperat ure across the PCB can cause a mismatch in \nthe Seebeck voltages at solder joints and other points where dissi-\nmilar metals are in contact, resulting in thermal voltage errors. To minimize these thermocouple effects, orient resistors so heat sources warm both ends equally. Input signal paths should \ncontain matching numbers and types of components, where \npossible to match the number and ty pe of thermocouple junctions. \nFor example, dummy components such as zero value resistors can be used to match real resistors in the opposite input path. Matching components should be located in close proximity and should be oriented in the same manner. Ensure leads are of equal \nlength so that thermal conduction is in equilibrium.

Using 5% tolerance resistors, the highest CMRR that can be \nguaranteed is 20 dB. Alternatively, using 0.1% tolerance resistors results in a common-mode rejection ratio of at least \n54 dB (assuming that the operational amplifier CMRR × \n54 dB). \nWith the CMRR of OPx177 at 120 dB minimum, the resistor \nmatch is the limiting factor in most circuits. A trimming resistor \ncan be used to further improve resistor matching and CMRR of the difference amplifier circuit. \nA HIGH ACCURACY THERMOCOUPLE AMPLIFIER \nA thermocouple consists of two dissimilar metal wires placed in contact. The dissimilar metals produce a voltage \nV\nTC = α(T J − T R) \nwhere: \nTJ is the temperature at the me asurement of the hot junction. \nTR is the temperature at the cold junction. \nα is the Seebeck coefficient specific to the dissimilar metals used in the thermocouple. \nV\nTC is the thermocouple voltage and becomes larger with \nincreasing temperature. \nMaximum measurement accuracy requires cold junction compen-\nsation of the thermocouple. To  perform the cold junction \ncompensation, apply a copper wire short across the terminating junctions (inside the isothermal block) simulating a 0°C point. Adjust the output voltage to zero using the R5 trimming resistor, and remove the copper wire. \nThe OPx177 is an ideal amplifie r for thermocouple circuits \nbecause it has a very low offset voltage, excellent PSRR and \nCMRR, and low noise at low frequencies. \nIt can be used to create a th ermocouple circuit with great \nlinearity. Resistor R1, Resistor R2, and Diode D1, shown in \nFigure 64, are mounted in an isothermal block.

Type K Thermocouple Amplifier Circuit \nLOW POWER LINEARIZED RTD \nA common application for a single element varying bridge is an \nRTD thermometer amplifier, as shown in Figure 65. The excita-\ntion is delivered to the bridge by a 2.5 V reference applied at the top of the bridge. \nRTDs may have thermal resistance  as high as 0.5°C to 0.8°C  \nper mW. To minimize errors due to resistor drift, the current \nthrough each leg of the bridge must  be kept low. In this circuit, \nthe amplifier supply current flows through the bridge. \nHowever, at the OPx177 maximum supply current of 600 μA, \nthe RTD dissipates less than 0.1 mW of power, even at the highest resistance. Errors due to power dissipation in the bridge are kept under 0.1°C. \nCalibration of the bridge is made at the minimum value of \ntemperature to be measured by adjusting R\nP until the output is \nzero. To calibrate the output span, set the full-scale and linearity \npotentiometers to midpoint an d apply a 500°C temperature to \nthe sensor or substitute the equivalent 500°C RTD resistance. \nAdjust the full-scale potentiometer for a 5 V output. Finally, \napply 250°C or the equivalent RT D resistance and adjust the \nlinearity potentiometer for 2.5 V output.

I | Page 21 of 24 REALIZATION OF ACTIVE FILTERS \nBAND-PASS KRC OR SALLEN-KEY FILTER \nThe low offset voltage and the high CMRR of the OPx177 make \nit an excellent choice for precision filters, such as the band-pass KRC filter shown in Figure 67. This filter type offers the capability to tune the gain and the cutoff frequency independently. \nBecause the common-mode voltage into the amplifier varies \nwith the input signal in the KRC filter circuit, a high CMRR is \nrequired to minimize distortion. Also, the low offset voltage of \nthe OPx177 allows a wider dynamic range when the circuit gain is chosen to be high. \nThe circuit of Figure 67 consists of two stages. The first stage is \na simple high-pass filter where the corner frequency (f\nC) is \nC1C2R1R2\uf07021 (2) \nand  \nR2R1K Q\uf03d  (3) \nwhere K is the dc gain. \nChoosing equal capacitor values minimizes the sensitivity and simplifies Equation 2 to \nR1R2 C\uf07021 \nThe value of Q determines the peaking of the gain vs. frequency \n(ringing in transient response).  Commonly chosen values for Q \nare generally near unity. \nSetting \n21Q\uf03d  yields minimum gain peaking and minimum \nringing. Determine values for R1  and R2 by using Equation 3. \nFor ,\n21Q\uf03d  R1/R2 = 2 in the circuit example. Select R1 = \n5 kΩ and R2 = 10 kΩ for simplicity. \nThe second stage is a low-pass fi lter where the corner frequency \ncan be determined in a simila r fashion.

OP2177 input and bias circuitry is designed to prevent feedthrough of signals from one am plifier channel to the other. As \na result, the OP2177 has an impre ssive channel separation of \ngreater than −120 dB for frequenc ies up to 100 kHz and greater \nthan −115 dB for signals up to 1 MHz. \n02627-067C3\n680pF\n1/2\nOP2177786\n5\n4V+\nV–1/2\nOP217712\n3R2\n10kΩ\nV1+\n–R1\n20kΩC2\n10nFC1\n10nFR3\n33kΩR4\n33kΩ\nC4\n330pFVOUT\n \nFigure 67.
