The MAX4426 is a dual inverting power MOSFET driver. The MAX4427 is a dual noninverting power MOSFET driver, and the MAX4428 contains one inverting section and one noninverting section. Delay times are nearly independent of V\nDD \n(see Typical Operating Characteristics ). High-current \noutput drivers rapidly charge and discharge the gate capacitance of even the largest power MOSFETs to within millivolts of the supply rails. This produces the power MOSFETs' minimum on resistance.

However, these inputs must never be allowed to stay between V\nIH and V IL for more than 50ns. Unused \ninputs should always be connected to ground to mini -\nmize supply current. Drivers can be paralleled on the MAX4426 or MAX4427 by tying both Inputs together and both outputs together.\nSupply bypassing and grounding are extremely impor -\ntant with the MAX4426/MAX4427/MAX4428, as the peak \nsupply current can be as high as 3A, which is twice the peak output current. Ground drops are a form of nega -\ntive feedback with inverters, and hence will degrade the delay and transition time of the MAX4426/MAX4428.\nSuggested bypass capacitors are a 4.7µF (low ESR) \ncapacitor in parallel with a 0.1µF ceramic capaci -\ntor, mounted as close as possible to the MAX4426/MAX4427/MAX4428. Use a ground plane if possible or separate ground returns for inputs and outputs. Output voltage ringing can be minimized with a 5Ω to 20Ω resis -\ntor in series with the output, but this will degrade output transition time. Ringing may be undesirable due to the large current that flows through capacitive loads when the voltage across these loads transitions quickly.\nOperation at the upper end of the supply voltage range \n(> 15V) requires that a capacitance of at least 50pF be present at the outputs. This prevents the supply voltage provided to the die (which can be different from that seen at the supply pin) from exceeding the 20V absolute maximum rating, due to overshoot. Since at least 50pF of gate capacitance is present in all higher power FETs, this requirement is easily met.Power Dissipation\nThe MAX4426/MAX4427/MAX4428 power dissipation consists of input inverter losses, crowbar current through the output devices, and output current (either capacitive or resistive). The sum of these must be kept below the maximum power dissipation limit.\nThe DC input inverter supply current is 0.2mA when both \ninputs are low and 2mA when both inputs are high. The crowbar current through an output device making a tran -\nsition is approximately 100mA for a few nanoseconds. This is a small portion of the total supply current, except for high switching frequencies or a small load capaci -\ntance (100pF).\nThe MAX4426/MAX4427/MAX4428 power dissipation \nwhen driving a ground-referenced resistive load is:\nP = (D) (r\nON(MAX) ) (ILOAD2)\nwhere D is the percentage of time the MAX4426/MAX4427/MAX4428 output pulls high, r\nON(MAX)  \nis the MAX4426/MAX4427/MAX4428 maximum on resistance, and I\nLOAD  is the MAX4426/MAX4427/\nMAX4428 load current.\nFor capacitive loads. the power dissipation is:\nP = (C LOAD ) (VDD2) (FREQ)\nwhere C LOAD  is the capacitive load. V DD is the MAX4426/\nMAX4427/MAX4428 supply voltage, and FREQ is the \ntoggle frequency.\nMAX4426/MAX4427/MAX4428\n4\nMaxim Integrated\nDual High-Speed 1.5A MOSFET Drivers\nFigure 1.
