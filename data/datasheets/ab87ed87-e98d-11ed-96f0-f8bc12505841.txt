SOPC Builder is an Altera Quartus II design tool that facilitates system-integration of IP blocks in an FPGA design. The SOPC Builder automatically generates interconnect logic and creates a \ntestbench to verify functionality, saving valuable design time. \nCyclone III device family expands the peripheral set, memory , I/O, or performance of \nlegacy embedded processors. Single or multiple Nios II embedded processors are designed into Cyclone III device family to provide additional co-processing power, or even replace legacy embedded processors in your system. Using the Cyclone III device family and Nios II together provide low-cost, high-performance embedded processing solutions, which in turn allow you to extend the life cycle of your product and improve time-to-market over standard product solutions. \n1 Separate licensing of the Freescale and ARM embedded processors are required.\nHot Socketing and Power-On-Reset \nCyclone III device family features hot socketing (also known as hot plug-in or hot \nswap) and power sequencing support without the use of external devices. You can insert or remove a board populated with one or more Cyclone III device family during a system operation without causing undesirable effects to the running system bus or the board that was inserted into the system. \nThe hot socketing feature allows you to use FPGAs on PCBs that also contain a \nmixture of 3.3-V, 2.5-V, 1.8-V , 1.5-V, and 1.2-V devices. The Cyclone III device family hot socketing feature eliminates power-up sequence requirements for other devices on the board for proper FPGA operation.\nf For more information about hot socketing and power-on-reset, refer to the \nHot-Socketing and Power-on-Reset in Cyclone III Devices  chapter.\nSEU Mitigation \nCyclone III LS devices offer built-in error detection circuitry to detect data corruption \ndue to soft errors in the CRAM cells. This feature allows CRAM contents to be read and verified to match a configuration-computed CRC value. The Quartus II software activates the built-in 32-bit CRC checker, which is part of the Cyclone III LS device.\nf For more information about SEU mitigation, refer to the SEU Mitigation in Cyclone III \nDevices  chapter.\n1–10 Chapter 1: Cyclone III Device Family Overview\nCyclone III Device Family Architecture\nCyclone III Device Handbook, Volume 1 © December 2009 Altera CorporationJTAG Boundary Scan Testing \nCyclone III device family supports the JTAG IEEE Std. 1149.1 specification. The \nboundary-scan test (BST) architecture offers the capability to test pin connections without using physical test probes and captures functional data while a device is operating normally. Boundary-scan cells in the Cyclone III device family can force signals onto pins or capture data from pins or from logic array signals. Forced test data is serially shifted into the boundary-scan cells. Captured data is serially shifted \nout and externally compared to expected results. In addition to BST, you can use the \nIEEE Std. 1149.1 controller for the Cyclone III LS device in-circuit reconfiguration (ICR).\nf For more information about JTAG boundary scan testing, refer to the IEEE 1149.1 \n(JTAG) Boundary Scan Testing for Cyclone III Devices  chapter.\nQuartus II Software Support\nThe Quartus II software is the leading design software for performance and \nproductivity. It is the only complete design solution for CPLDs, FPGAs, and ASICs in the industry . The Quartus II software includes an integrated development environment to accelerate system-level design and seamless integration with leading \nthird-party software tools and flows. \nThe Cyclone III LS devices provide both physical and functional separation between \nsecurity critical design partitions. Cyclone III LS devices offer isolation between design partitions. This ensures that device errors do not propagate from one partition to another, whether unintentional or intentional. The Quartus II software design separation flow facilitates the creation of separation regions in Cyclone III LS devices by tightly controlling the routing in and between the LogicLock regions. For ease of use, the separation flow integrates in the existing incremental compilation flow. \nf For more information about the Quartus II software features, refer to the Quartus II \nHandbook .\nConfiguration \nCyclone III device family uses SRAM cells to store configuration data. Configuration \ndata is downloaded to Cyclone III device family each time the device powers up. Low-cost configuration options include the Altera EPCS family serial flash devices as well as commodity parallel flash configuration options. These options provide the flexibility for general-purpose applications and the ability to meet specific configuration and wake-up time requirements of the applications. Cyclone III device family supports the AS, PS, FPP, and JTAG configuration schemes. The AP configuration scheme is only supported in Cyclone III devices. \nf For more information about configuration, refer to the Configuration, Design Security, \nand Remote System Upgrades in Cyclone III Devices  chapter.\nChapter 1: Cyclone III Device Family Overview 1–11\nCyclone III Device Family Architecture\n© December 2009 Altera Corporation Cyclone III Device Handbook, Volume 1Remote System Upgrades \nCyclone III device family offers remote system upgrade without an external \ncontroller. The remote system upgrade capability in Cyclone III device family allows system upgrades from a remote location. Soft logic (either the Nios II embedded processor or user logic) implemented in Cyclone III device family can download a new configuration image from a remote location, store it in configuration memory, and direct the dedicated remote system upgrade circuitry to start a reconfiguration \ncycle. The dedicated circuitry performs error detection during and after the \nconfiguration process, and can recover from an error condition by reverting to a safe configuration image. The dedicated circuitry also provides error status information. Cyclone III devices support remote system upgrade in the AS and AP configuration scheme. Cyclone III LS devices support remote system upgrade in the AS configuration scheme only.\nf For more information, refer to the Configuration, Design Security, and Remote System \nUpgrades in Cyclone III Devices  chapter.\nDesign Security (Cyclone III LS Devices Only)\nCyclone III LS devices offer design security features which play a vital role in the large \nand critical designs in the competitive military and commercial environments. \nEquipped with the configuration bit stream encryption and anti-tamper features, Cyclone III LS devices protect your designs from copying, reverse engineering and tampering.
