A ferroelectric random access\nmemory or F-RAM is nonvolatile and performs reads and writes\nsimilar to a RAM. It provides reliable data retention for 151 yearswhile eliminating the complexities, overhead, and system-level\nreliability problems caused by serial flash, EEPROM, and other\nnonvolatile memories. \nUnlike serial flash and EEPROM, the FM25V10 performs write\noperations at bus speed. No wr ite delays are incurred. Data is\nwritten to the memory array immediately after each byte is\nsuccessfully transferred to the device. The next bus cycle cancommence without the need for data polling. In addition, the\nproduct offers substantial writ e endurance compared with other\nnonvolatile memories. The FM25V10 is capable of supporting10\n14 read/write cycles, or 100 million times more write cycles\nthan EEPROM. \nThese capabilities make the FM25V10 ideal for nonvolatile\nmemory applications, requirin g frequent or rapid writes.\nExamples range from data collec tion, where the number of write\ncycles may be critical, to demanding  industrial controls where the\nlong write time of serial flash or EEPROM can cause data loss. \nThe FM25V10 provides substantia l benefits to users of serial\nEEPROM or flash as a hardware  drop-in replacement. The\nFM25V10 uses the high-speed SPI bus, which enhances the\nhigh-speed write capability  of F-RAM technology. The\nFM25VN10 is offered with a unique serial number that is\nread-only and can be used to identify a board or system. Both\nthe devices incorporates a read-only Device ID that allows thehost to determine the manufacturer, product density, and product\nrevision. The device specific ations are guaranteed over an\nindustrial temperature range of –40 \uf0b0C to +85 \uf0b0C.\nFor a complete list of related documentation, click here.\nInstruction Decoder\nClock Generator\nControl Logic\nWrite Protect\nInstruction Register\nAddress Register  \nCounter128 K x 8       \nF-RAM Array\n 17\nData  I/   O Register8\nNonvolatile Status\nRegister3WP\nCS\nHOLD\nSCK\nSO SILogic Block Diagram\nFM25V10\nDocument Number: 001-84499 Rev. *H Page 2 of 25Contents\nPinouts ..............................................................................3\nPin Definitions ..................................................................3Functional Overview ........................................................4\nMemory Architecture ........... ........................................4\nSerial Peripheral Interface – SPI Bus ..........................4\nSPI Overview ...............................................................4\nSPI Modes ...................................................................5Power Up to First Access .... ........................................6\nCommand Structure ....................................................6\nWREN - Set Write Enable Latch  .......... .............. .........6\nWRDI - Reset Write Enable Latch ...............................6\nStatus Register and Write Prot ection .............................7\nRDSR - Read Status Register  .....................................8\nWRSR - Write Status Register ....................................8\nMemory Operation ............................................................8\nWrite Operation ...........................................................8Read Operation ...........................................................9\nFast Read Operation ...................................................9\nHOLD Pin Operation .................................................10Sleep Mode ...............................................................11\nDevice ID ...................................................................11\nUnique Serial Number (FM 25VN10 only) ..................12\nFunction to Calculate CRC ..... .............. .............. .......13\nEndurance .................................................................14Maximum Ratings ........................................................... 15\nOperating Range ............................................................. 15DC Electrical Characteristics ........................................ 15\nData Retention and Endurance ..................................... 16\nCapacitance .................................................................... 16\nThermal Resistance ........................................................ 16\nAC Test Conditions ........................................................ 16AC Switching Characteristics ....................................... 17\nPower Cycle Timing ....................................................... 19\nOrdering Information ...................................................... 20\nOrdering Code Definitions ..... .................................... 20\nPackage Diagrams .......................................................... 21\nAcronyms ........................................................................ 23Document Conventions ................................................. 23\nUnits of Measure ....................................................... 23\nDocument History Page ................................................. 24Sales, Solutions, and Legal Information ...................... 25\nWorldwide Sales and Design S upport ......... .............. 25\nProducts .................................................................... 25PSoC®Solutions ....................................................... 25\nCypress Developer Community ................................. 25\nTechnical Support ................. .................................... 25\nFM25V10\nDocument Number: 001-84499 Rev. *H Page 3 of 25Pinouts\nFigure 1.  8-pin SOIC pinout\nFigure 2.  8-pin DFN pinoutHOLD\nSCK1\n2\n3\n4  5CS  8\n 7\n 6VDD\nSISO Top View\nnot to scale\nVSSWP\nSOCS\nVSSWP\nSIVDD\nSCKHOLD1\n2\n45678\n3O\nPADEXPOSED\nTop View\nnot to scale\nPin Definitions\nPin Name I/O Type Description\nCS Input Chip Select .

The memory array is\nlogically organized as 131,072 × 8 bits and is accessed using anindustry-standard serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus. The\nfunctional operation of the F-RAM is similar to serial flash and\nserial EEPROMs. The major diff erence between the FM25V10\nand a serial flash or EEPROM with the same pinout is the\nF-RAM\'s superior write performance, high endurance, and lowpower consumption. \nMemory Architecture\nWhen accessing the FM25V10, the user addresses 64Klocations of eight data bits each. These eight data bits are shifted\nin or out serially. The addresses are accessed using the SPI\nprotocol, which includes a chip select (to permit multiple deviceson the bus), an opcode, and a three-byte address. The upper 7\nbits of the address range are \'don\'t care\' values. The complete\naddress of 17 bits specifies each byte address uniquely. \nMost functions of the FM25V10 are either controlled by the SPI\ninterface or handled by on-board circuitry. The access time for\nthe memory operation is essentially zero, beyond the time\nneeded for the serial protocol. That is, the memory is read orwritten at the speed of the SPI  bus. Unlike a serial flash or\nEEPROM, it is not necessary to  poll the device for a ready\ncondition because writes occur at bus speed. By the time a newbus transaction can be shifted into the device, a write operation\nis complete. This is explained in more detail in the interface\nsection. \nSerial Peripheral Interface – SPI Bus\nThe FM25V10 is a SPI slave device and operates at speeds upto 40 MHz. This high-speed serial bus provideshigh-performance serial communication to a SPI master. Many\ncommon microcontrollers have hardware SPI ports allowing a\ndirect interface. It is quite simple to emulate the port usingordinary port pins for microcontrollers that do not. The FM25V10\noperates in SPI Mode 0 and 3. \nSPI Overview\nThe SPI is a four-pin inte rface with Chip Select (CS ), Serial Input\n(SI), Serial Output (SO), a nd Serial Clock (SCK) pins. \nThe SPI is a synchronous serial interface, which uses clock and\ndata pins for memory access a nd supports multiple devices on\nthe data bus. A device on the SPI  bus is activated using the CS\npin. \nThe relationship between chip select, clock, and data is dictated\nby the SPI mode. This device supports SPI modes 0 and 3. In\nboth of these modes, data is clocked into the F-RAM on the rising\nedge of SCK starting from the first rising edge after CS  goes\nactive. \nThe SPI protocol is controlled by opcodes. These opcodes\nspecify the commands from the bus master to the slave device.\nAfter CS  is activated, the first byte transferred from the bus\nmaster is the opcode. Followin g the opcode, any addresses anddata are then transferred. The CS  must go inactive after an\noperation is complete and before a new opcode can be issued.The commonly used terms in the SPI protocol are as follows:\nSPI Master\nThe SPI master device controls the operations on a SPI bus. An\nSPI bus may have only one master with one or more slavedevices. All the slaves share the same SPI bus lines and the\nmaster may select any of t he slave devices using the CS\n pin. All\nof the operations must be initiated by the master activating aslave device by pulling the CS\n pin of the slave LOW. The master\nalso generates the SCK and a ll the data transmission on SI and\nSO lines are synchronize d with this clock. \nSPI Slave\nThe SPI slave device is activated by the master through the Chip\nSelect line. A slave device gets the SCK as an input from the SPI\nmaster and all the communicat ion is synchronized with this\nclock. An SPI slave never initiates a communication on the SPIbus and acts only on the instruction from the master.\nThe FM25V10 operates as an SPI slave and may share the SPI\nbus with other SPI slave devices. \nChip Select (CS\n)\nTo select any slave device, the master needs to pull down the\ncorresponding CS  pin. Any instruction can be issued to a slave\ndevice only while the CS  pin is LOW. When the device is not\nselected, data through the SI pin is ignored and the serial output\npin (SO) remains in a high-impedance state.\nNote  A new instruction must begin with the falling edge of CS .\nTherefore, only one opcode can be issued for each active Chip\nSelect cycle.\nSerial Clock (SCK)\nThe Serial Clock is generated by the SPI master and the\ncommunication is synchronize d with this clock after CS  goes\nLOW.\nThe FM25V10 enables SPI modes 0 and 3 for data\ncommunication. In both of thes e modes, the inputs are latched\nby the slave device on the rising edge of SCK and outputs areissued on the falling edge. Therefor e, the first rising edge of SCK\nsignifies the arrival of the first bit (MSB) of a SPI instruction on\nthe SI pin. Further, all data inputs and outputs are synchronizedwith SCK.\nData Transmission (SI/SO)\nThe SPI data bus consists of two lines, SI and SO, for serial data\ncommunication. SI is also referred to as Master Out Slave In\n(MOSI) and SO is referred to as Master In Slave Out (MISO). The\nmaster issues instructions to t he slave through the SI pin, while\nthe slave responds through the SO pin. Multiple slave devices\nmay share the SI and SO lines as described earlier.\nThe FM25V10 has two separate pins for SI and SO, which can\nbe connected with the master as shown in Figure 3 .\nFM25V10\nDocument Number: 001-84499 Rev. *H Page 5 of 25For a microcontroller that has no dedicated SPI bus, a\ngeneral-purpose port may be used. To reduce hardwareresources on the controller, it is possible to connect the two data\npins (SI, SO) together and tie off (HIGH) the HOLD\n and WP  pins.\nFigure 4  shows such a configuration,  which uses only three pins.\nMost Significant Bit (MSB)\nThe SPI protocol requires  that the first bit to be transmitted is the\nMost Significant Bit (MSB). This is valid for both address and\ndata transmission. \nThe 1-Mbit serial F-RAM requires a 3-byte address for any read\nor write operation. Because the address is only 17 bits, the first\nseven bits, which are fed in are ignored by the device. Although\nthese seven bits are ‘don’t care’, Cypress recommends thatthese bits be set to 0s to enable seamless transition to higher\nmemory densities.\nSerial Opcode\nAfter the slave device is selected with CS  going LOW, the first\nbyte received is treated as the opcode for the intended operation.\nFM25V10 uses the standard opcodes for memory accesses.\nInvalid Opcode\nIf an invalid opcode is received, the opcode is ignored and the\ndevice ignores any additional serial data on the SI pin until the\nnext falling edge of CS , and the SO pin remains tristated.\nStatus Register\nFM25V10 has an 8-bit Status Register. The bits in the Status\nRegister are used to configur e the device. These bits are\ndescribed in Table 3 on page 7 .\nSPI Modes\nFM25V10 may be driven by a microcontroller with its SPI\nperipheral running in either of the following two modes:\n■SPI Mode 0 (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0)\n■SPI Mode 3 (CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1)For both these modes, the input data is latched in on the rising\nedge of SCK starting from the first rising edge after CS  goes\nactive. If the clock starts from a HIGH state (in mode 3), the first\nrising edge after the clock toggles is considered. The output data\nis available on the falling edge of SCK. Figure 3.

The status of the clock when the bus master is not\ntransferring data is:\n■SCK remains at 0 for Mode 0 \n■SCK remains at 1 for Mode 3 \nThe device detects the SPI mode from the status of the SCK pin\nwhen the device is selected by bringing the CS  pin LOW. If the\nSCK pin is LOW when the device is selected, SPI Mode 0 is\nassumed and if the SCK pin is HIGH, it works in SPI Mode 3.\nPower Up to First Access\nThe FM25V10 is not accessible for a tPU time after power-up.\nUsers must comply with the timing parameter, tPU, which is the\nminimum time from VDD (min) to the first CS  LOW. \nCommand Structure\nThere are ten commands, called opcodes, that can be issued bythe bus master to the FM25V 10. They are listed in Table 1 .\nThese opcodes control the functions performed by the memory.WREN - Set Write Enable Latch\nThe FM25V10 will power up with writes disabled. The WRENcommand must be issued before any write operation. Sendingthe WREN opcode allows the user to issue subsequent opcodes\nfor write operations. These include writing the Status Register\n(WRSR) and writing the memory (WRITE). \nSending the WREN opcode causes the internal Write Enable\nLatch to be set. A flag bit in the Status Register, called WEL,\nindicates the state of the latch. WE L = ’1’ indicates that writes are\npermitted. Attempting to write the WEL bit in the Status Register\nhas no effect on the state of this bit – only the WREN opcode can\nset this bit. The WEL bit will be automatically cleared on the risingedge of CS\n following a WRDI, a WRSR, or a WRITE operation.\nThis prevents further writes to th e Status Register or the F-RAM\narray without another WREN command. Figure 7  illustrates the\nWREN command bus configuration.\nWRDI - Reset Write Enable Latch\nThe WRDI command disables all write activity by clearing theWrite Enable Latch. The user can verify that writes are disabled\nby reading the WEL bit in the Status Register and verifying that\nWEL is equal to ‘0’. Figure 8  illustrates the WRDI command bus\nconfiguration.Figure 5.  SPI Mode 0\nFigure 6.  SPI Mode 3\nTable 1.

The Status Registeris organized as follows. (The default value shipped from the\nfactory for bit 0, WEL, BP0, BP1, bits 4–5, WPEN is ‘0’, and forbit 6 is ‘1’).\nBits 0 and 4-5 are fixed at ‘0’ and bi t 6 is fixed at ‘1’; none of these\nbits can be modified. Note that bit 0 (“Ready or Write in progress”bit in serial flash and EEPROM) is unnecessary, as the F-RAM\nwrites in real-time and is never busy, so it reads out as a ‘0’. An\nexception to this is when the device is waking up from sleepmode, which is described in Sleep Mode on page 11 . The BP1\nand BP0 control the software wr ite-protection f eatures and are\nnonvolatile bits. The WEL flag indicates the state of the WriteEnable Latch. Attemp ting to directly write the WEL bit in the\nStatus Register has no effect on it s state. This bit is internally set\nand cleared via the WREN and WRDI commands, respectively. \nBP1 and BP0 are memory block write protection bits. They\nspecify portions of me mory that are write- protected as shown in\nTable 4 .The BP1 and BP0 bits and the Write Enable Latch are the only\nmechanisms that protect the memo ry from writes. The remaining\nwrite protection features protect inadvertent changes  to the block\nprotect bits. \nThe write protect enable bit (WPEN) in the Status Register\ncontrols the effect of the hardware write protect (WP\n) pin. When\nthe WPEN bit is set to \'0\', the status of the WP  pin is ignored.\nWhen the WPEN bit is set to \'1\', a LOW on the WP  pin inhibits a\nwrite to the Status Register. Thus the Status Register iswrite-protected only when WPEN = \'1\' and WP\n = \'0\'. \nTable 5  summarizes the write protection conditions.Table 2.

Reading the status register\nprovides information about the current state of the\nwrite-protection features. Fo llowing the RDSR opcode, the\nFM25V10 will return one byte with the contents of the Status\nRegister. \nWRSR - Write Status Register\nThe WRSR command allows the SPI bus master to write into theStatus Register and change the write protect configuration bysetting the WPEN, BP0 and BP1 bits as required. Before issuing\na WRSR command, the WP\n pin must be HIGH or inactive. Note\nthat on the FM25V10, WP  only prevents writing to the Status\nRegister, not the memory array. Before sending the WRSR\ncommand, the user must send a WREN command to enable\nwrites. Executing a WRSR command is a write operation and\ntherefore, clears the Write Enable Latch.\nMemory Operation\nThe SPI interface, which is capable of a high clock frequency,\nhighlights the fast write capability of the F-RAM technology.\nUnlike serial flash and EEPROM s, the FM25V10 can perform\nsequential writes at bus speed.  No page register is needed and\nany number of sequential wr ites may be performed. \nWrite Operation\nAll writes to the memory begin with a WREN opcode with CS\nbeing asserted and deasserted. The next opcode is WRITE. The\nWRITE opcode is followed by a three-byte address containingthe 17-bit address (A16-A0) of the first data byte to be written into\nthe memory. Subsequent bytes are data bytes, which are written\nsequentially. Addresses are incremented internally as long asthe bus master continues to issue clocks and keeps CS\n LOW. Ifthe last address of 1FFFFh is re ached, the counter will roll over\nto 00000h. Data is written MSB first. The rising edge of CS\nterminates a write operation. A write operation is shown in Figure\n11.\nNote  When a burst write reaches a protected block address, the\nautomatic address increment stops and all the subsequent data\nbytes received for write will be ignored by the device.\nEEPROMs use page buffers to increase their write throughput.\nThis compensates for the technology\'s inherently slow write\noperations. F-RAM memories do not have page buffers because\neach byte is written to the F-RAM array immediately after it isclocked in (after the eighth cl ock). This allows any number of\nbytes to be written without page buffer delays.\nNote  If the power is lost in the mi ddle of the write operation, only\nthe last completed byte will be written.Figure 9.

Following the READ command is a three-byte addresscontaining the 17-bit address (A16–A0) of the first byte of the\nread operation. After the opcode and address are issued, the\ndevice drives out th e read data on the next eight clocks. The SI\ninput is ignored during read da ta bytes. Subsequent bytes are\ndata bytes, which are read out sequentially. Addresses areincremented internally as long as the bus master continues to\nissue clocks and CS\n is LOW. If the last address of 1FFFFh is\nreached, the counter will roll over to 00000h. Data is read MSBfirst. The rising edge of CS\n terminates a read operation and\ntristates the SO pin. A read operation is shown in  Figure 12 .\nFast Read Operation\nThe FM25V10 supports a FAST READ opcode (0Bh) that is\nprovided for code compatibility with serial flash devices. TheFAST READ opcode is followed by a three-byte address\ncontaining the 17-bit address (A16-A 0) of the first byte of the\nread operation and then a dummy byte. The dummy byte inserts\na read latency of 8-clock cycle. The fast read operation is\notherwise the same as an ordinary read operation except that it\nrequires an additional dummy byte. After receiving opcode,\naddress, and a dummy byte, the FM25V10 starts driving its SOline with data bytes, with MSB first, and continues transmitting\nas long as the device is selected and the clock is available. In\ncase of bulk read, the internal  address counter is incremented\nautomatically, and after the last address 1FFFFh is reached, the\ncounter rolls over to 00000h. When the device is driving data on\nits SO line, any transition on its SI line is ignored. The rising edgeof CS\n terminates a fast read operation and tristates the SO pin.\nA Fast Read operation is shown in Figure 13 .\nFigure 11.  Memory Write (WREN not shown) Operation\nFigure 12.

If the bus master pulls the HOLD  pin LOW while SCK\nis LOW, the current operation will pause. Taking the HOLD  pinHIGH while SCK is LOW will resume an operation. The\ntransitions of HOLD  must occur while SCK is LOW, but the SCK\nand CS  pin can toggle during a hold state.Figure 13.

The device will enter the low-power state when theSLEEP opcode B9h is clocked in and a rising edge of CS\n is\napplied. When in sleep mode, the SCK and SI pins are ignored\nand SO will be HI-Z, but the device continues to monitor the CSpin. On the next falling edge of CS , the device will return to\nnormal operation within tREC time. The SO pin remains in a HI-Z\nstate during the wakeup period. The device does not necessarily\nrespond to an opcode within the wakeup period. To start the\nwakeup procedure, the controller  may send a “dummy” read, for\nexample, and wait the remaining tREC time.\nDevice ID\nThe FM25V10 device can be interrogated for its manufacturer,\nproduct identification, and di e revision. The RDID opcode 9Fh\nallows the user to read the manu facturer ID and product ID, both\nof which are read-only bytes. The JEDEC-assignedmanufacturer ID places the Cy press (Ramtron) identifier in\nbank 7; therefore, th ere are six bytes of the continuation code\n7Fh followed by the single byte C2h. There are two bytes of\nproduct ID, which includes a family code, a density code, a subcode, and the product revision code.Figure 15.

It can be used to uniq uely identify a pc board or system.\nThe serial number includes a 40-bit unique number, an 8-bit\nCRC, and a 16-bit number that can be defined upon request by\nthe customer. If a customer-specific number is not requested, the\n16-bit Customer Identifier is 0x0000.\nThe serial number is read by issuing the SNR op-code (C3h).The 8-bit CRC value can be used to compare to the value\ncalculated by the controller. If the two values match, then thecommunication between slave and master was performed\nwithout errors. The function (shown below) is used to calculatethe CRC value. To perform the calculation, 7 bytes of data are\nfilled into a memory buffer in the same order as they are read\nfrom the part – i.e. byte 7, byte 6,  byte 5, byte 4, byte 3, byte 2,\nbyte 1 of the serial number. The calculation is performed on the\n7 bytes, and the result should match the final byte out from thepart which is byte 0, the 8-bit CRC value.\nNote  Contact factory for requesting  a customer identifier number.Table 7.  8-Byte Serial Number (Read only)\nCustomer Identifier 40-bit Unique number 8-bit CRC\nSN (63:56) SN (55:48) SN (47:40) SN (39:32) SN (31:24) SN (23:16) SN (15:8) SN (7:0)\nFM25V10\nDocument Number: 001-84499 Rev. *H Page 13 of 25Function to Calculate CRC\nBYTE calcCRC8( BYTE* pData, int nBytes )\n{static BYTE crctable [256] = {\n};\nBYTE crc = 0;\nwhile( nBytes-- ) crc = cr ctable[crc ^ *pData++];\nreturn crc;}0x00, 0x07, 0x0E, 0x09, 0x1C, 0x1B, 0x12, 0x15,\n0x38, 0x3F, 0x36, 0x31, 0x24, 0x23, 0x2A, 0x2D,0x70, 0x77, 0x7E, 0x79, 0x6C, 0x6B, 0x62, 0x65,\n0x48, 0x4F, 0x46, 0x41, 0x54, 0x53, 0x5A, 0x5D,\n0xE0, 0xE7, 0xEE, 0xE9, 0xFC, 0xFB, 0xF2, 0xF5,0xD8, 0xDF, 0xD6, 0xD1, 0xC4, 0xC3, 0xCA, 0xCD,\n0x90, 0x97, 0x9E, 0x99, 0x8C, 0x8B, 0x82, 0x85,\n0xA8, 0xAF, 0xA6, 0xA1, 0xB4, 0xB3, 0xBA, 0xBD,0xC7, 0xC0, 0xC9, 0xCE, 0xDB, 0xDC, 0xD5, 0xD2,0xFF, 0xF8, 0xF1, 0xF6, 0xE3, 0xE4, 0xED, 0xEA,\n0xB7, 0xB0, 0xB9, 0xBE, 0xAB, 0xAC, 0xA5, 0xA2,\n0x8F, 0x88, 0x81, 0x86, 0x93, 0x94, 0x9D, 0x9A,0x27, 0x20, 0x29, 0x2E, 0x3B, 0x3C, 0x35, 0x32,\n0x1F, 0x18, 0x11, 0x16, 0x03, 0x04, 0x0D, 0x0A,\n0x57, 0x50, 0x59, 0x5E, 0x4B, 0x4C, 0x45, 0x42,0x6F, 0x68, 0x61, 0x66, 0x73, 0x74, 0x7D, 0x7A,\n0x89, 0x8E, 0x87, 0x80, 0x95, 0x92, 0x9B, 0x9C,\n0xB1, 0xB6, 0xBF, 0xB8, 0xAD, 0xAA, 0xA3, 0xA4,0xF9, 0xFE, 0xF7, 0xF0, 0xE5, 0xE2, 0xEB, 0xEC,\n0xC1, 0xC6, 0xCF, 0xC8, 0xDD, 0xDA, 0xD3, 0xD4,\n0x69, 0x6E, 0x67, 0x60, 0x75, 0x72, 0x7B, 0x7C,0x51, 0x56, 0x5F, 0x58, 0x4D, 0x4A, 0x43, 0x44,\n0x19, 0x1E, 0x17, 0x10, 0x05, 0x02, 0x0B, 0x0C,\n0x21, 0x26, 0x2F, 0x28, 0x3D, 0x3A, 0x33, 0x34,0x4E, 0x49, 0x40, 0x47, 0x52, 0x55, 0x5C, 0x5B,\n0x76, 0x71, 0x78, 0x7F, 0x6A, 0x6D, 0x64, 0x63,\n0x3E, 0x39, 0x30, 0x37, 0x22, 0x25, 0x2C, 0x2B,0x06, 0x01, 0x08, 0x0F, 0x1A, 0x1D, 0x14, 0x13,\n0xAE, 0xA9, 0xA0, 0xA7, 0xB2, 0xB5, 0xBC, 0xBB,\n0x96, 0x91, 0x98, 0x9F, 0x8A, 0x8D, 0x84, 0x83,0xDE, 0xD9, 0xD0, 0xD7, 0xC2, 0xC5, 0xCC, 0xCB,\n0xE6, 0xE1, 0xE8, 0xEF, 0xFA, 0xFD, 0xF4, 0xF3\nFM25V10\nDocument Number: 001-84499 Rev. *H Page 14 of 25Endurance\nThe FM25V10 devices are capable of being accessed at least\n1014 times, reads or writes. An F-RAM memory operates with a\nread and restore mechanism. Therefore, an endurance cycle is\napplied on a row basis for each access (read or write) to the\nmemory array. The F-RAM architecture is based on an array of\nrows and columns of 16K rows of  64-bits each. The entire row is\ninternally accessed once, whether a single byte or all eight bytesare read or written. Each byte in  the row is counted only once in\nan endurance calculation. Table 7  shows endurance calculations\nfor a 64-byte repeating loop, whic h includes an opcode, a starting\naddress, and a sequential 64-byte data stream. This causes\neach byte to experience one endurance cycle through the loop.F-RAM read and write endurance is  virtually unlimited even at a\n40-MHz clock rate.\nTable 8.
