EP2W1+ is designed to handle \n1.7W internal dissipation as a combiner allowing reliable operation without excessive temperature rise.  \nSimilar splitters implemented as Wilkinson splitters on PCB require big resistors and additional heat sink -\ning. As a splitter, EP2W1+ can handle up to 2.5W in a very small package.\nDC Passing up to 0.4ADC current passing is helpful in applications where both RF & DC need to pass through the DUT, such as \nantenna mounted hardware.\nTiny size, 5 x 5 mm QFN packageTiny footprint saves space in dense layouts while providing low inductance, repeatable transitions, and \nexcellent thermal contact to the PCB.Generic photo used for illustration purposes only\nREV.
