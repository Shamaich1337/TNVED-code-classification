Data is shifted out on the falling edge of serial \nclock (C).\n3.2 Serial data input (D)\nThis input signal is used to transfer data serially into the device. It receives instructions, addresses, and the data \nto be written. Values are latched on the rising edge of serial clock (C).\n3.3 Serial clock (C)\nThis input signal provides the timing of the serial interface. Instructions, addresses, or data present at Serial data \ninput (D) are latched on the rising edge of serial clock (C). Data on serial data output (Q) change from the falling \nedge of serial clock (C).\n3.4 Chip select ( S)\nWhen this input signal is high, the device is deselected and serial data output (Q) is at high impedance. The \ndevice is in the standby power mode, unless an internal write cycle is in progress. Driving chip select ( S) low \nselects the device, placing it in the active power mode.\nAfter power-up, a falling edge on chip select ( S) is required prior to the start of any instruction.\n3.5 Hold ( HOLD )\nThe hold ( HOLD ) signal is used to pause any serial communications with the device without deselecting the \ndevice.\nDuring the hold condition, the serial data output (Q) is high impedance, and serial data input (D) and serial clock \n(C) are "Don’t care".\nTo start the Hold condition, the device must be selected, with chip select ( S) driven low.\n3.6 Write protect ( W)\nThe main purpose of this input signal is to freeze the size of the area of memory that is protected against write \ninstructions (as specified by the values in the BP1 and BP0 bits of the status register).\nThis pin must be driven either high or low, and must be stable during all write instructions.\n3.7 VCC supply voltage\nVCC is the supply voltage.\n3.8 VSS ground\nVSS is the reference for all signals, including the V CC supply voltage.\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nSignal description\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 5/47\n4 Connecting to the SPI bus\nAll instructions, addresses and input data bytes are shifted in to the device, most significant bit first. The serial \ndata input (D) is sampled on the first rising edge of the serial clock (C) after chip select ( S) goes low.\nAll output data bytes are shifted out of the device, most significant bit first. The serial data output (Q) is latched on \nthe first falling edge of the serial clock (C) after the instruction (such as the read from memory array and read \nstatus register instructions) have been clocked into the device.\nFigure 5.

Only one memory device \nis selected at a time, so only one memory device drives the serial data output (Q) line at a time. The other \nmemory devices are high impedance.\nThe pull-up resistor R (represented in Figure 5 ) ensures that a device is not selected if the bus master leaves the \nS line in the high impedance state.\nIn applications where the bus master may leave all SPI bus lines in high impedance at the same time (for \nexample, if the bus master is reset during the transmission of an instruction), it is recommended to connect the \nclock line (C) to an external pull-down resistor so that, if all inputs/outputs become high impedance, the C line is \npulled low (while the S line is pulled high): this ensures that S and C do not become high at the same time, and \nso, that the t SHCH  requirement is met. The typical value of R is 100 kΩ.\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nConnecting to the SPI bus\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 6/47\n4.1 SPI modes\nThese devices can be driven by a microcontroller with its SPI peripheral running in either of the following two \nmodes:\n• CPOL=0, CPHA=0\n• CPOL=1, CPHA=1\nFor these two modes, input data is latched in on the rising edge of serial clock (C), and output data is available \nfrom the falling edge of serial clock (C).\nThe difference between the two modes, as shown in Figure 6 , is the clock polarity when the bus master is in \nstand-by mode and not transferring data:\n• C remains at 0 for (CPOL=0, CPHA=0)\n• C remains at 1 for (CPOL=1, CPHA=1)\nFigure 6.

This voltage must remain \nstable and valid until the end of the transmission of the instruction and, for a write instruction, until the completion \nof the internal write cycle (t W). In order to secure a stable DC supply voltage, it is recommended to decouple the \nVCC line with a suitable capacitor (usually of the order of 10 nF to 100 nF) close to the V CC/VSS device pins.\n5.1.2 Device reset\nIn order to prevent erroneous instruction decoding and inadvertent write operations during power-up, a power-on-\nreset (POR) circuit is included. At power-up, the device does not respond to any instruction until V CC reaches the \nPOR threshold voltage. This threshold is lower than the minimum V CC operating voltage (see Section 9 DC and \nAC parameters ).\nAt power-up, when V CC passes over the POR threshold, the device is reset and is in the following state:\n• in standby power mode\n• deselected\n• status register values:\n– the write enable latch (WEL) bit is reset to 0\n– the write in progress (WIP) bit is reset to 0\n– the SRWD, BP1 and BP0 bits remain unchanged (non-volatile bits).\nIt is important to note that the device must not be accessed until V CC reaches a valid and stable level within the \nspecified [V CC(min), V CC(max)] range, as defined under Operating conditions in Section 9 DC and AC \nparameters .\n5.1.3 Power-up conditions\nWhen the power supply is turned on, V CC rises continuously from V SS to V CC. During this time, the chip select ( S) \nline is not allowed to float but should follow the V CC voltage. It is therefore recommended to connect the S line to \nVCC via a suitable pull-up resistor (see Figure 5 ).\nIn addition, the chip select ( S) input offers a built-in safety feature, as the S input is edge-sensitive as well as \nlevel-sensitive: after power-up, the device does not become selected until a falling edge has first been detected \non chip select ( S). This ensures that chip select ( S) must have been high, prior to going low to start the first \noperation.\nThe V CC voltage has to rise continuously from 0 V up to the minimum V CC operating voltage defined under \nOperating conditions in Section 9 DC and AC parameters .\n5.1.4 Power-down\nDuring power-down (continuous decrease of the V CC supply voltage below the minimum V CC operating voltage \ndefined under Operating conditions in Section 9 DC and AC parameters ), the device must be:\n• deselected (chip select S should be allowed to follow the voltage applied on V CC),\n• in standby power mode (there should not be any internal write cycle in progress).\n5.2 Active power and standby power modes\nWhen chip select ( S) is low, the device is selected, and in the active power mode. The device consumes I CC.\nWhen chip select ( S) is high, the device is deselected. If a write cycle is not currently in progress, the device then \ngoes into the standby power mode, and the device consumption drops to I CC1, as specified in DC characteristics \n(see Section 9 DC and AC parameters ).\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nOperating features\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 8/47\n5.3 Hold condition\nThe hold ( HOLD ) signal is used to pause any serial communications with the device without resetting the clocking \nsequence.\nTo enter the hold condition, the device must be selected, with chip select ( S) low.\nDuring the hold condition, the serial data output (Q) is high impedance, and the serial data input (D) and the serial \nclock (C) are "Don’t care".\nNormally, the device is kept selected for the whole duration of the hold condition. Deselecting the device while it is \nin the hold condition has the effect of resetting the state of the device, and this mechanism can be used if required \nto reset any processes that had been in progress.\nNote: This resets the internal logic, except the WEL and WIP bits of the status register.\nNote: In the specific case where the device has shifted in a write command (inst + address + data bytes, each data \nbyte being exactly 8 bits), deselecting the device also triggers the write cycle of this decoded command.\nFigure 7. Hold condition activation\nai02029Ec\nHOLD\nHold \nconditionHold \ncondition\nThe hold condition starts when the hold ( HOLD ) signal is driven low when serial clock (C) is already low (as \nshown in Figure 7 ).\nFigure 7  also shows what happens if the rising and falling edges are not timed to coincide with serial clock (C) \nbeing low.\n5.4 Status register\nThe status register contains a number of status and control bits that can be read or set (as appropriate) by \nspecific instructions. Section 6.3 Read status register (RDSR)  for a detailed description of the status register bits.\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nHold condition\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 9/47\n5.5 Data protection and protocol control\nThe device features the following data protection mechanisms:\n• Before accepting the execution of the write and write status register instructions, the device checks \nwhether the number of clock pulses comprised in the instructions is a multiple of eight.\n• All instructions that modify data must be preceded by a write enable (WREN) instruction to set the write \nenable latch (WEL) bit.\n• The block protect (BP1, BP0) bits in the status register are used to configure part of the memory as read-\nonly.\n• The write protect ( W) signal is used to protect the block protect (BP1, BP0) bits in the status register. For \nany instruction to be accepted, and executed, chip select ( S) must be driven high after the rising edge of \nserial clock (C) for the last bit of the instruction, and before the next rising edge of serial clock (C).\nTwo points should be noted in the previous sentence:\n• The “last bit of the instruction” can be the eighth bit of the instruction code, or the eighth bit of a data byte, \ndepending on the instruction (except for read status register (RDSR) and read (READ) instructions).\n• The “next rising edge of serial clock (C)” might (or might not) be the next bus transaction for some other \ndevice on the SPI bus.\nTable 2.

The only way to do this \nis to send a write enable instruction to the device.\nAs shown in Figure 8 , to send this instruction to the device, chip select ( S) is driven low, and the bits of the \ninstruction byte are shifted in, on serial data input (D). The device then enters a wait state. It waits for the device \nto be deselected, by chip select ( S) being driven high.\nFigure 8.

It waits for a the device to be deselected, by chip select ( S) being driven high.\nThe write enable latch (WEL) bit, in fact, becomes reset by any of the following events:\n• Power-up\n• WRDI instruction execution\n• WRSR instruction completion\n• WRITE instruction completion.\nFigure 9.

The status register may be read at \nany time, even while a write or write status register cycle is in progress. When one of these cycles is in progress, \nit is recommended to check the write in progress (WIP) bit before sending a new instruction to the device. It is \nalso possible to read the status register continuously, as shown in Figure 10 .\nFigure 10. Read status register (RDSR) sequence\nDT47548V2C\nDS\n21 3456789101112131415\nInstruction0\nQStatus Register Out\nHigh impedance\nMSB MSB7 7654321076543210Status Register Out\nThe status and control bits of the status register are as follows:\n6.3.1 WIP bit\nThe write in progress (WIP) bit indicates whether the memory is busy with a write or write status register cycle. \nWhen set to 1, such a cycle is in progress, when reset to 0, no such cycle is in progress.\n6.3.2 WEL bit\nThe write enable latch (WEL) bit indicates the status of the internal write enable latch. When set to 1, the internal \nwrite enable latch is set. When set to 0, the internal write enable latch is reset, and no write or write status register \ninstruction is accepted.\nThe WEL bit is returned to its reset state by the following events:\n• Power-up\n• Write disable (WRDI) instruction completion\n• Write status register (WRSR) instruction completion\n• Write (WRITE) instruction completion\n6.3.3 BP1, BP0 bits\nThe block protect (BP1, BP0) bits are non volatile. They define the size of the area to be software-protected \nagainst write instructions. These bits are written with the write status register (WRSR) instruction. When one or \nboth of the block protect (BP1, BP0) bits is set to 1, the relevant memory area (as defined in Table 2 ) becomes \nprotected against write (WRITE) instructions. The block protect (BP1, BP0) bits can be written provided that the \nhardware protected mode has not been set.\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nRead status register (RDSR)\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 13/47\n6.3.4 SRWD bit\nThe status register write disable (SRWD) bit is operated in conjunction with the write protect ( W) signal. The \nstatus register write disable (SRWD) bit and write protect ( W) signal enable the device to be put in the hardware \nprotected mode (when the status register write disable (SRWD) bit is set to 1, and write protect ( W) is driven low). \nIn this mode, the non-volatile bits of the status register (SRWD, BP1, BP0) become read-only bits and the write \nstatus register (WRSR) instruction is no longer accepted for execution.\nTable 5. Status register format\n6.4 Write status register (WRSR)\nThe write status register (WRSR) instruction is used to write new values to the status register. Before it can be \naccepted, a write enable (WREN) instruction must have been previously executed.\nThe write status register (WRSR) instruction is entered by driving chip select ( S) low, followed by the instruction \ncode, the data byte on serial data input (D) and chip select ( S) driven high. Chip select ( S) must be driven high \nafter the rising edge of serial clock (C) that latches in the eighth bit of the data byte, and before the next rising \nedge of serial clock (C). Otherwise, the write status register (WRSR) instruction is not executed.\nThe instruction sequence is shown in Figure 11 .\nFigure 11. Write status register (WRSR) sequence\nC\nDS\n21 345678910 1112131415\nInstruction0\nMS47556V1ditaQStatus Register In\nHigh impedanceMSB76543210\nDriving the chip select ( S) signal high at a byte boundary of the input data triggers the self- timed write cycle that \ntakes t W to complete (as specified in AC tables under Section 9 DC and AC parameters ).\nWhile the write status register cycle is in progress, the status register may still be read to check the value of the \nwrite in progress (WIP) bit: the WIP bit is 1 during the self-timed write cycle t W, and 0 when the write cycle is \ncomplete. The WEL bit (write enable latch) is also reset at the end of the write cycle t W.\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nWrite status register (WRSR)\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 14/47\nThe write status register (WRSR) instruction enables the user to change the values of the BP1, BP0 and SRWD \nbits:\n• The block protect (BP1, BP0) bits define the size of the area that is to be treated as read-only, as defined in \nTable 2 .\n• The SRWD (status register write disable) bit, in accordance with the signal read on the write protect pin \n(W), enables the user to set or reset the write protection mode of the status register itself, as defined in \nTable 6 . When in write-protected mode, the write status register (WRSR) instruction is not executed.\nThe contents of the SRWD and BP1, BP0 bits are updated after the completion of the WRSR instruction, \nincluding the t W write cycle.\nThe write status register (WRSR) instruction has no effect on the b6, b5, b4, b1, b0 bits in the status register. Bits \nb6, b5, b4 are always read as 0.\nTable 6.

See Table 2\n \nThe protection features of the device are summarized in Table 6 .\nWhen the status register write disable (SRWD) bit in the status register is 0 (its initial delivery state), it is possible \nto write to the status register (provided that the WEL bit has previously been set by a WREN instruction), \nregardless of the logic level applied on the write protect ( W) input pin.\nWhen the status register write disable (SRWD) bit in the status register is set to 1, two cases should be \nconsidered, depending on the state of the write protect ( W) input pin:\n• If write protect ( W) is driven high, it is possible to write to the status register (provided that the WEL bit has \npreviously been set by a WREN instruction).\n• If write protect ( W) is driven low, it is not possible to write to the status register even if the WEL bit has \npreviously been set by a WREN instruction. (Attempts to write to the status register are rejected, and are \nnot accepted for execution). As a consequence, all the data bytes in the memory area, which are software-\nprotected (SPM) by the block protect (BP1, BP0) bits in the status register, are also hardware-protected \nagainst data modification.\nRegardless of the order of the two events, the hardware-protected mode (HPM) can be entered by:\n• either setting the SRWD bit after driving the write protect ( W) input pin low,\n• or driving the write protect ( W) input pin low after setting the SRWD bit.\nOnce the hardware-protected mode (HPM) has been entered, the only way of exiting it is to pull high the write \nprotect ( W) input pin.\nIf the write protect ( W) input pin is permanently tied high, the hardware-protected mode (HPM) can never be \nactivated, and only the software-protected mode (SPM), using the block protect (BP1, BP0) bits in the status \nregister, can be used.\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nWrite status register (WRSR)\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 15/47\n6.5 Read from memory array (READ)\nAs shown in Figure 12 , to send this instruction to the device, chip select ( S) is first driven low. The bits of the \ninstruction byte and address bytes are then shifted in, on serial data input (D). The address is loaded into an \ninternal address register, and the byte of data at that address is shifted out, on serial data output (Q).\nFigure 12.

The whole memory can, therefore, be read with a single READ instruction.\nThe read cycle is terminated by driving chip select ( S) high. The rising edge of the chip select ( S) signal can occur \nat any time during the cycle.\nThe instruction is not accepted, and is not executed, if a write cycle is currently in progress.\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nRead from memory array (READ)\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 16/47\n6.6 Write to memory array (WRITE)\nAs shown in Figure 13 , to send this instruction to the device, chip select ( S) is first driven low. The bits of the \ninstruction byte, address byte, and at least one data byte are then shifted in, on serial data input (D).\nThe instruction is terminated by driving chip select ( S) high at a byte boundary of the input data. The self-timed \nwrite cycle, triggered by the chip select ( S) rising edge, continues for a period t W (as specified in AC \ncharacteristics in Section 9 DC and AC parameters ), at the end of which the write in progress (WIP) bit is reset to \n0.\nFigure 13.

However, if chip select ( S) continues to be \ndriven low, as shown in Figure 14 , the next byte of input data is shifted in, so that more than a single byte, starting \nfrom the given address towards the end of the same page, can be written in a single internal write cycle.\nEach time a new data byte is shifted in, the least significant bits of the internal address counter are incremented. If \nmore bytes are sent than will fit up to the end of the page, a condition known as “roll-over” occurs. In case of roll-\nover, the bytes exceeding the page size are overwritten from location 0 of the same page.\nThe instruction is not accepted, and is not executed, under the following conditions:\n• if the write enable latch (WEL) bit has not been set to 1 (by executing a write enable instruction just before),\n• if a write cycle is already in progress,\n• if the device has not been deselected, by driving high chip select ( S), at a byte boundary (after the eighth \nbit, b0, of the last data byte that has been latched in),\n• if the addressed page is in the region protected by the block protect (BP1 and BP0) bits.\nNote: The self-timed write cycle t W is internally executed as a sequence of two consecutive events: [erase addressed \nbyte(s)], followed by [program addressed byte(s)]. An erased bit is read as “0” and a programmed bit is read as \n“1”.\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nWrite to memory array (WRITE)\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 17/47\nFigure 14.

The ECC is an internal logic function which \nis transparent for the SPI communication protocol.\nThe ECC logic is implemented on each group of four EEPROM bytes(c). Inside a group, if a single bit out of the \nfour bytes happens to be erroneous during a read operation, the ECC detects this bit and replaces it with the \ncorrect value. The read reliability is therefore much improved.\nEven if the ECC function is performed on groups of four bytes, a single byte can be written/cycled independently. \nIn this case, the ECC function also writes/cycles the three other bytes located in the same group(c). As a \nconsequence, the maximum cycling budget is defined at group level and the cycling can be distributed over the \nfour bytes of the group: the sum of the cycles seen by byte0, byte1, byte2 and byte3 of the same group must \nremain below the maximum value defined in Table 12 .\nNote: A group of four bytes is located at addresses [4*N, 4*N+1, 4*N+2, 4*N+3], where N is an integer\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nWrite to memory array (WRITE)\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 18/47\n6.7 Read identification page (available only in M95640-D devices)\nThe identification page (32 bytes) is an additional page which can be written and (later) permanently locked in \nread-only mode.\nReading this page is achieved with the read identification page instruction (see Table 3 ). The chip select signal ( S) \nis first driven low, the bits of the instruction byte and address bytes are then shifted in, on serial data input (D). \nAddress bit A10 must be 0, upper address bits are Don\'t Care, and the data byte pointed to by the lower address \nbits [A4:A0] is shifted out on serial data output (Q). If chip select ( S) continues to be driven low, the internal \naddress register is automatically incremented, and the byte of data at the new address is shifted out.\nThe number of bytes to read in the ID page must not exceed the page boundary, otherwise unexpected data is \nread (e.g.: when reading the ID page from location 10d, the number of bytes should be less than or equal to 22d, \nas the ID page boundary is 32 bytes).\nThe read cycle is terminated by driving chip select ( S) high. The rising edge of the chip select ( S) signal can occur \nat any time during the cycle. The first byte addressed can be any byte within any page.\nThe instruction is not accepted, and is not executed, if a write cycle is currently in progress.\nFigure 15.

The read lock status sequence is defined with the chip select ( S) first driven low. The bits of the \ninstruction byte and address bytes are then shifted in on serial data input (D). Address bit A10 must be 1, all other \naddress bits are Don\'t Care. The lock bit is the LSB (least significant bit) of the byte read on serial data output (Q). \nIt is at “1” when the lock is active and at “0” when the lock is not active. If chip select ( S) continues to be driven \nlow, the same data byte is shifted out. The read cycle is terminated by driving chip select ( S) high.\nThe instruction sequence is shown in Figure 17 .\nFigure 17.

Before this instruction can be \naccepted, a write enable (WREN) instruction must have been executed.\nThe lock ID instruction is issued by driving chip select ( S) low, sending the instruction code, the address and a \ndata byte on serial data input (D), and driving chip select ( S) high. In the address sent, A10 must be equal to 1, all \nother address bits are Don\'t Care. The data byte sent must be equal to the binary value xxxx xx1x, where x = \nDon\'t Care.\nChip select ( S) must be driven high after the rising edge of serial clock (C) that latches in the eighth bit of the data \nbyte, and before the next rising edge of serial clock (C). Otherwise, the lock ID instruction is not executed.\nDriving chip select ( S) high at a byte boundary of the input data triggers the self-timed write cycle whose duration \nis tW (as specified in AC characteristics in Section 9 DC and AC parameters ). The instruction sequence is shown \nin Figure 18 .\nM95640-W M95640-R M95640-DF\nRead lock status (available only in M95640-D devices)\nDS6633  - Rev 20 page 20/47\nThe instruction is discarded, and is not executed, under the following conditions:\n• If a write cycle is already in progress,\n• if the block protect bits (BP1,BP0) = (1,1),\n• if a rising edge on chip select ( S) happens outside of a byte boundary.\nFigure 18.
