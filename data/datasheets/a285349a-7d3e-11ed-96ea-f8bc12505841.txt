The devices are capable of \nsupplying 1.5A of output current with a dropout voltage of \n340mV. Operating quiescent current is 1mA, dropping to \n<1µA in shutdown. Quiescent current is well controlled;  it \ndoes not rise in dropout as it does with many other regula -\ntors. In addition to fast transient response, the LT1963A \nregulators have very low output noise which makes them \nideal for sensitive RF supply applications.\nOutput voltage range is from 1.21V to 20V. The LT1963A \nregulators are stable with output capacitors as low as \n10µF. Internal protection circuitry includes reverse bat -\ntery protection, current limiting, thermal limiting and \nreverse current protection. The devices are available in \nfixed output voltages of 1.5V , 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V and as \nan adjustable device with a 1.21V reference voltage. The \nLT1963A regulators are available in 5-lead TO-220, DD, \n3-lead SOT-223, 8-lead SO and 16-lead TSSOP packages.\n3.3V to 2.5V Regulatorn 3.3V to 2.5V Logic Power Supplies\nn Post Regulator for Switching Supplies\nIN\nSHDN10µF*\n*TANTALUM,\n  CERAMIC OR\n  ALUMINUM ELECTROLYTIC\n1963A TA01OUT\nVIN > 3V\nSENSE\nGNDLT1963A-2.52.5V\n1.5A\n10µF*+ +\nOUTPUT CURRENT (A)0DROPOUT VOLTAGE (mV)200300\n1.6\n1963A TA02100\n0\n0.4 0.8 1.2 0.2 0.6 1.0 1.4400\n150250\n50350Dropout VoltageAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Exposure to any Absolute \nMaximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device \nreliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: Absolute maximum input to output differential voltage can not \nbe achieved with all combinations of rated IN pin and OUT pin voltages. \nWith the IN pin at 20V, the OUT pin may not be pulled below 0V. The total \nmeasured voltage from IN to OUT can not exceed ±20V.\nNote 3: The L T1963A regulators are tested and specified under pulse load \nconditions such that T J ≈ TA. The L T1963AE is 100% tested at T A = 25°C. \nPerformance at –40°C and 125°C is assured by design, characterization and \ncorrelation with statistical process controls. The L T1963AI is guaranteed \nover the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. The \nL T1963AMP is 100% tested and guaranteed over the –55°C to 125°C \noperating junction temperature range.\nNote 4: The L T1963A (adjustable version) is tested and specified for these \nconditions with the ADJ pin connected to the OUT pin.\nNote 5: Operating conditions are limited by maximum junction \ntemperature. The regulated output voltage specification will not apply \nfor all possible combinations of input voltage and output current. When \noperating at maximum input voltage, the output current range must be \nlimited. When operating at maximum output current, the input voltage \nrange must be limited.Note 6: To satisfy requirements for minimum input voltage, the L T1963A \n(adjustable version) is tested and specified for these conditions with an \nexternal resistor divider (two 4.12k resistors) for an output voltage of 2.4V. \nThe external resistor divider will add a 300µA DC load on the output.\nNote 7: Dropout voltage is the minimum input to output voltage differential \nneeded to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In dropout, the \noutput voltage will be equal to: V IN – V DROPOUT .\nNote 8: GND pin current is tested with V IN = V OUT(NOMINAL)  + 1V and a \ncurrent source load. The GND pin current will decrease at higher input \nvoltages.\nNote 9: ADJ pin bias current flows into the ADJ pin.\nNote 10: SHDN pin current flows into the SHDN pin.\nNote 11: Reverse output current is tested with the IN pin grounded and the \nOUT pin forced to the rated output voltage. This current flows into the OUT \npin and out the GND pin.\nNote 12: For the L T1963A, L T1963A-1.5 and L T1963A-1.8 dropout voltage \nwill be limited by the minimum input voltage specification under some \noutput voltage/load conditions.\nNote 13: For the ST package, the input reverse leakage current increases \ndue to the additional reverse leakage current for the SHDN pin, which is \ntied internally to the IN pin.\nLT1963A Series\n7\nRev.

G For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONS\nThe output will be off when the SHDN pin is pulled low. \nThe SHDN pin can be driven either by 5V logic or open-\ncollector logic with a pull-up resistor. The pull-up resis -\ntor is required to supply the pull-up current of the open-\ncollector gate, normally several microamperes, and the \nSHDN pin current, typically 3µA. If unused, the SHDN pin \nmust be connected to V IN. The device will be in the low \npower shutdown state if the SHDN pin is not connected.\nIN: Input. Power is supplied to the device through the IN \npin. A bypass capacitor is required on this pin if the device \nis more than six inches away from the main input filter \ncapacitor. In general, the output impedance of a battery \nrises with frequency, so it is advisable to include a bypass \ncapacitor in battery-powered circuits. A bypass capacitor \nin the range of 1µF to 10µF is sufficient. The LT1963A \nregulators are designed to withstand reverse voltages \non the IN pin with respect to ground and the OUT pin. In \nthe case of a reverse input, which can happen if a battery \nis plugged in backwards, the device will act as if there is \na diode in series with its input. There will be no reverse \ncurrent flow into the regulator and no reverse voltage \nwill appear at the load. The device will protect both itself \nand the load.OUT:  Output. The output supplies power to the load. \nA minimum output capacitor of 10µF is required to \nprevent oscillations. Larger output capacitors will be  \nrequired for applications with large transient loads to limit \npeak voltage transients. See the Applications Information \nsection for more information on output capacitance and \nreverse output characteristics.\nSENSE: Sense. For fixed voltage versions of the LT1963A \n(LT1963A-1.5/LT1963A-1.8/LT1963A-2.5/LT1963A-3.3), \nthe SENSE pin is the input to the error amplifier. Optimum \nregulation will be obtained at the point where the SENSE \npin is connected to the OUT pin of the regulator. In criti -\ncal applications, small voltage drops are caused by the \nresistance (R P) of PC traces between the regulator and the \nload. These may be eliminated by connecting the SENSE \npin to the output at the load as shown in Figure\xa01 (Kelvin \nSense Connection). Note that the voltage drop across \nthe external PC traces will add to the dropout voltage of \nthe regulator. The SENSE pin bias current is 600µA at \nthe nominal rated output voltage. The SENSE pin can be \npulled below ground (as in a dual supply system where \nthe regulator load is returned to a negative supply) and \nstill allow the device to start and operate.\nADJ: Adjust. For the adjustable LT1963A, this is the input \nto the error amplifier. This pin is internally clamped to ± 7V. \nIt has a bias current of 3µA which flows into the pin. The \nADJ pin voltage is 1.21V referenced to ground and the \noutput voltage range is 1.21V to 20V.\nSHDN:  Shutdown.

G For more information www.analog.comThe LT1963A series are 1.5A low dropout regulators opti -\nmized for fast transient response. The devices are capable \nof supplying 1.5A at a dropout voltage of 350mV . The low \noperating quiescent current (1mA) drops to less than 1µA  \nin shutdown. In addition to the low quiescent current, the \nLT1963A regulators incorporate several protection fea -\ntures which make them ideal for use in battery-powered \nsystems. The devices are protected against both reverse \ninput and reverse output voltages. In battery backup appli -\ncations where the output can be held up by a backup bat -\ntery when the input is pulled to ground, the LT1963A -X \nacts like it has a diode in series with its output and prevents \nreverse current flow. Additionally, in dual supply applica -\ntions where the regulator load is returned to a negative \nsupply, the output can be pulled below ground by as much \nas 20V and still allow the device to start and operate.\nAdjustable Operation\nThe adjustable version of the LT1963A has an output volt -\nage range of 1.21V to 20V. The output voltage is set by \nthe ratio of two external resistors as shown in Figure\xa02. \nThe device servos the output to maintain the voltage at \nthe  ADJ pin at 1.21V referenced to ground. The current \nin R1 is then equal to 1.21V/R1 and the current in R2 is \nthe current in R1 plus the ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ \npin bias current, 3µA at 25°C, flows through R2 into the \nADJ pin. The output voltage can be calculated using the \nformula in Figure\xa02. The value of R1 should be less than \n4.17k to minimize errors in the output voltage caused by \nthe ADJ pin bias current. Note that in shutdown the output \nis turned off and the divider current will be zero.\nThe adjustable device is tested and specified with the ADJ \npin tied to the OUT pin for an output voltage of 1.21V . \nSpecifications for output voltages greater than 1.21V will \nbe proportional to the ratio of the desired output voltage \nto 1.21V:  VOUT/1.21V . For example, load regulation for an \noutput current change of 1mA to 1.5A is – 3mV typical at \nVOUT = 1.21V. At V OUT = 5V, load regulation is:\n (5V/1.21V)(–3mV) = –12.4mV\nOutput Capacitors and Stability\nThe LT1963A regulator is a feedback circuit. Like any \nfeedback circuit, frequency compensation is needed to make it stable. For the LT1963A , the frequency compensa -\ntion is both internal and external—the output capacitor. \nThe size of the output capacitor, the type of the output \ncapacitor, and the ESR of the particular output capacitor \nall affect the stability.\nIn addition to stability, the output capacitor also affects \nthe high frequency transient response. The regulator \nloop has a finite band width. For high frequency transient \nloads, recovery from a transient is a combination of the \noutput capacitor and the bandwidth of the regulator. The  \nLT1963A was designed to be easy to use and accept a  \nwide variety of output capacitors. However, the frequency \ncompensation is affected by the output capacitor and opti -\nmum frequency stability may require some ESR, espe -\ncially with ceramic capacitors.  \nFor ease of use, low ESR polytantalum capacitors \n(POSCAP) are a good choice for both the transient \nresponse and stability of the regulator. These capacitors \nhave intrinsic ESR that improves the stability. Ceramic \ncapacitors have extremely low ESR, and while they are a \ngood choice in many cases, placing a small series resis -\ntance element will sometimes achieve optimum stability \nand minimize ringing. In all cases, a minimum of 10µF is \nrequired while the maximum ESR allowable is 3Ω.\nThe place where ESR is most helpful with ceramics is  \nlow output voltage. At low output voltages, below 2.5V, \nsome ESR helps the stability when ceramic output capac -\nitors are used. Also, some ESR allows a smaller capaci -\ntor value to be used. When small signal ringing occurs \nwith ceramics due to insufficient ESR, adding ESR or \nincreasing the capacitor value improves the stability and \nreduces the ringing. Table\xa01 gives some recommended \nvalues of ESR to minimize ringing caused by fast, hard \ncurrent transitions.IN\n1963A F02R2OUT\nVINVOUT\nADJ\nGNDLT1963A\nR1+\nFigure\xa02.

G For more information www.analog.comat the worst case value of 1.2V. T race A, is with a 10µF \nceramic output capacitor and shows significant ringing \nwith a peak amplitude of 25mV . For T race B, a 22µF/ 45mΩ  \nPOSCAP is added in parallel with the 10µF ceramic. The \noutput is well damped and settles to within 10mV in less \nthan 20µs.  \nFor T race C, a 100µF/ 35mΩ POSCAP is connected in \nparallel with the 10µF ceramic capacitor . In this case the \npeak output deviation is less than 20mV and the output \nsettles in about 10µs. For improved transient response \nthe value of the bulk capacitor (tantalum or aluminum \nelectrolytic) should be greater than twice the value of the \nceramic capacitor .\nTantalum and Polytantalum Capacitors\nThere is a variety of tantalum capacitor types available, \nwith a wide range of ESR specifications. Older types \nhave ESR specifications in the hundreds of mΩ to sev -\neral Ohms. Some newer types of polytantalum with \nmulti-electrodes have maximum ESR specifications as \nlow as 5mΩ. In general the lower the ESR specification, \nthe larger the size and the higher the price. Polytantalum \ncapacitors have better surge capability than older types \nand generally lower ESR. Some types such as the Sanyo \nTPE and TPB series have ESR specifications in the 20mΩ \nto 50mΩ range, which provide near optimum transient \nresponse. \nAluminum Electrolytic Capacitors\nAluminum electrolytic capacitors can also be used with the \nLT1963A. These capacitors can also be used in conjunc -\ntion with ceramic capacitors. These tend to be the cheap -\nest and lowest performance type of capacitors. Care must \nbe used in selecting these capacitors as some types can \nhave ESR which can easily exceed the 3Ω  maximum value. \nCeramic Capacitors\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic \ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a \nvariety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over \ntemperature and applied voltage. The most common  \ndielectrics used are Z5U, Y5V, X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Table\xa01.

These scope photos \nshow the transient response for the LT1963A at three dif -\nferent output voltages with various capacitors and various \nvalues of ESR. The output load conditions are the same \nfor all traces. In all cases there is a DC load of 500mA. \nThe load steps up to 1A at the first transition and steps \nback to 500mA at the second transition.  \nAt the worst case point of 1.2V OUT with 10µF C OUT  \n(Figure\xa03), a minimum amount of ESR is required. While \n20mΩ is enough to eliminate most of the ringing, a value \ncloser to 50mΩ provides a more optimum response. At \n2.5V output with 10µF C OUT (Figure\xa04) the output rings  \nat the transitions with 0Ω ESR but still settles to within \n10mV in 20µs  after the 0.5A load step. Once again a small \nvalue of ESR will provide a more optimum response.  \nAt 5VOUT with 10µF C OUT (Figure\xa05) the response is well \ndamped with 0Ω ESR.  \nWith a C OUT of 100µF at 0Ω ESR and an output of 1.2V \n(Figure\xa06), the output rings although the amplitude is only \n20mV p-p. With C OUT of 100µF it takes only 5mΩ to 20mΩ of \nESR to provide good damping at 1.2V output. Performance \nat 2.5V and 5V output with 100µF C OUT shows similar \ncharacteristics to the 10µF case (see Figure\xa07 - Figure\xa08). \nAt 2.5V OUT 5mΩ  to 20mΩ  can improve transient response.  \nAt 5V OUT the response is well damped with 0Ω ESR.\nCapacitor types with inherently higher ESR can be com -\nbined with 0mΩ ESR ceramic capacitors to achieve both \ngood high frequency bypassing and fast settling time. \nFigure\xa09 illustrates the improvement in transient response \nthat can be seen when a parallel combination of ceramic \nand POSCAP capacitors are used.

Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, \nsimilar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or micro -\nphone works. For a ceramic capacitor the stress can be \ninduced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients.“FREE” Resistance with PC T races\nThe resistance values shown in Table\xa02 can easily be made \nusing a small section of PC trace in series with the output \ncapacitor.  The wide range of non-critical ESR makes it  \neasy to use PC trace. The trace width should be sized to \nhandle the RMS ripple current associated with the load.  \nThe output capacitor only sources or sinks current for a \nfew microseconds during fast output current transitions. \nThere is no DC current in the output capacitor. Worst case \nripple current will occur if the output load is a high fre -\nquency (> 100kHz) square wave with a high peak value and \nfast edges (< 1µs). Measured RMS value for this case is \n0.5 times the peak-to-peak current change. Slower edges \nor lower frequency will significantly reduce the RMS ripple \ncurrent in the capacitor . \nFigure\xa010.

G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOutput Voltage Noise\nThe LT1963A regulators have been designed to provide \nlow output voltage noise over the 10Hz to 100kHz band -\nwidth while operating at full load. Output voltage noise is \ntypically 40nV/√Hz over this frequency bandwidth for the \nLT1963A (adjustable version). For higher output voltages \n(generated by using a resistor divider), the output voltage \nnoise will be gained up accordingly. This results in RMS \nnoise over the 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth of 14µV RMS for \nthe LT1963 A increasing to 38µV RMS for the LT1963A-3.3.\nHigher values of output voltage noise may be measured \nwhen care is not exercised with regard to circuit layout  \nand testing. Crosstalk from nearby traces can induce \nunwanted noise onto the output of the LT1963A-X. Power \nsupply ripple rejection must also be considered;  the \nLT1963A regulators do not have unlimited power supply \nrejection and will pass a small portion of the input noise \nthrough to the output.\nThermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device is limited \nby the maximum rated junction temperature (125° C). \nThe power dissipated by the device is made up of two \ncomponents:\n1. Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage \ndifferential: (I OUT)(VIN – V OUT), and\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage:  (IGND)\n(VIN).\nThe GND pin current can be found using the GND Pin \nCurrent curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics. \nPower dissipation will be equal to the sum of the two com-\nponents listed above.\nThe LT1963A series regulators have internal thermal \nlimiting designed to protect the device during overload \nconditions. For continuous normal conditions, the maxi -\nmum junction temperature rating of 125°C must not be  \nexceeded. It is important to give careful consideration to \nall sources of thermal resistance from junction to ambi -\nent. Additional heat sources mounted nearby must also \nbe considered.This resistor should be made using one of the inner  \nlayers of the PC board which are well defined. The resistiv -\nity is determined primarily by the sheet resistance of the \ncopper laminate with no additional plating steps. Table\xa02 \ngives some sizes for 0.75A RMS current for various cop -\nper thicknesses. More detailed information regarding \nresistors made from PC traces can be found in Application \nNote 69, Appendix A.\nOverload Recovery\nLike many IC power regulators, the LT1963A-X has \nsafe operating area protection. The safe area protection \ndecreases the current limit as input-to-output voltage \nincreases and keeps the power transistor inside a safe \noperating region for all values of input-to-output voltage. \nThe protection is designed to provide some output current \nat all values of input-to-output voltage up to the device \nbreakdown.\nWhen power is first turned on, as the input voltage rises, \nthe output follows the input, allowing the regulator to start \nup into very heavy loads. During the start-up, as the input \nvoltage is rising, the input-to-output voltage differential \nis small, allowing the regulator to supply large output  \ncurrents. With a high input voltage, a problem can occur \nwherein removal of an output short will not allow the \noutput voltage to recover. Other regulators, such as the \nLT1085, also exhibit this phenomenon, so it is not unique \nto the LT1963A-X.\nThe problem occurs with a heavy output load when \nthe input voltage is high and the output voltage is low. \nCommon situations are immediately after the removal of \na short-circuit or when the shutdown pin is pulled high \nafter the input voltage has already been turned on. The \nload line for such a load may intersect the output cur -\nrent curve at two points. If this happens, there are two \nstable output operating points for the regulator. With this \ndouble intersection, the input power supply may need to \nbe cycled down to zero and brought up again to make the \noutput recover.\nLT1963A Series\n19\nRev. G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board \nand its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated \nthrough-holes can also be used to spread the heat gener -\nated by power devices.\nThe following tables list thermal resistance for several \ndifferent board sizes and copper areas.

So the junction temperature rise above ambient will \nbe approximately equal to:\n 1.41W(28°C/W) = 39.5°C\nThe maximum junction temperature will then be equal to \nthe maximum junction temperature rise above ambient \nplus the maximum ambient temperature or:\n T JMAX = 50°C + 39.5°C = 89.5°C\nProtection Features\nThe LT1963A regulators incorporate several protection \nfeatures which make them ideal for use in battery-pow -\nered circuits. In addition to the normal protection features \nassociated with monolithic regulators, such as current \nlimiting and thermal limiting, the devices are protected \nagainst reverse input voltages, reverse output voltages \nand reverse voltages from output to input.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nare intended to protect the device against current overload \nconditions at the output of the device. For normal opera -\ntion, the junction temperature should not exceed 125°C.\nThe input of the device will withstand reverse voltages of \n20V. Current flow into the device will be limited to less \nthan 1mA (typically less than 100µA) and no negative \nvoltage will appear at the output. The device will protect \nboth itself and the load. This provides protection against \nbatteries that can be plugged in backward.\nLT1963A Series\n20\nRev. G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe output of the LT1963A can be pulled below ground \nwithout damaging the device. If the input is left open cir -\ncuit or grounded, the output can be pulled below ground \nby 20V. For fixed voltage versions, the output will act like a \nlarge resistor, typically 5k or higher, limiting current flow \nto typically less than 600µA. For adjustable versions, the \noutput will act like an open circuit ; no current will flow out \nof the pin. If the input is powered by a voltage source, the \noutput will source the short-circuit current of the device \nand will protect itself by thermal limiting. In this case, \ngrounding the SHDN pin will turn off the device and stop \nthe output from sourcing the short-circuit current.\nThe ADJ pin of the adjustable device can be pulled above \nor below ground by as much as 7V without damaging the \ndevice. If the input is left open circuit or grounded, the \nADJ pin will act like an open circuit when pulled below \nground and like a large resistor (typically 5k) in series with \na diode when pulled above ground.\nIn situations where the ADJ pin is connected to a resistor \ndivider that would pull the ADJ pin above its 7V clamp \nvoltage if the output is pulled high, the ADJ pin input cur -\nrent must be limited to less than 5mA . For example, a \nresistor divider is used to provide a regulated 1.5V output \nfrom the 1.21V reference when the output is forced to 20V . \nThe top resistor of the resistor divider must be chosen to \nlimit the current into the ADJ pin to less than 5mA when \nthe ADJ pin is at 7 V. The 13V difference between OUT \nand ADJ pins divided by the 5mA maximum current into \nthe ADJ pin yields a minimum top resistor value of 2.6k.Figure\xa012.

The output \nvoltage may be held up while the input is either pulled \nto ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage, or is left \nopen circuit. Current flow back into the output will follow \nthe curve shown in Figure\xa012.\nWhen the IN pin of the LT1963A is forced below the OUT \npin or the OUT pin is pulled above the IN pin, input cur -\nrent will typically drop to less than 2µA. This can happen \nif the input of the device is connected to a discharged \n(low voltage) battery and the output is held up by either \na backup battery or a second regulator circuit. The state \nof the SHDN pin will have no effect on the reverse output \ncurrent when the output is pulled above the input.\nLT1963A Series\n21\nRev.
