On \nresistance is closely matched between the switches and is flat \nover the full signal range. Each switch conducts equally well in \nboth directions , and the input signal range extends to the \nsupplies. Data is written to these devices in the form of 8  bits, \neach bit corresponding to one channel.  \nThe ADG714 uses a 3 -wire serial interface that is compatible \nwith serial peripheral interface (SPI ), QSPI™, MIC ROWIRE™  \ninterface standards , and most digital signal processing (DSP)  \ninterface standards. The output of the shift register DOUT \nenables a number of these devices  to be daisy -chained.  \nThe ADG715 uses a 2 -wire serial interface that is compatible \nwith the I2C interface standard. The ADG715 has four hardwired  \naddresses, selectable  from two external address  pins (A0 and A1) . \nThe pins  allow  the two LSBs of the 7 -bit slave address to be set \nby the user. A maximum of four of these devices may be  \nconnected to the b us. \nOn power -up of these devices, all switches are in the off \ncondition, and the internal registers contain all zeros.  \nA low power consumption and operating supply range of 2.7 V \nto 5.5 V  make these devices  ideal for many applications. These \ndevices  can also be supplied from a dual ±2.5 V  supply. The \nADG714 is available in a 24-lead TSSOP and a 24- lead LFCSP ,  FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM S \nADG714\nD1\nD2\nD3\nD4\nD5\nD6\nD7\nD8\nDOUTS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\nS5\nS6\nS7\nS8\nINPUT SHIFT\nREGISTER\nSCLK   DIN SYNC RESET\n00043-001 \nFigure 1.

E | Page 17 of 21 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe ADG714 and ADG715 are serially controlled, octal SPST \nswitches, controlled by either a 2 - or 3-wire interface. Each bit \nof the 8 -bit serial word corresponds to one switch of the device . \nA Logic 1 in the bit position turns the switch  on, and a Logic 0 \nturns the switch off. E ach switch is independently controlled by \nan individual b it, which  provides the option of having any, all, \nor none of the switches on . \nWhen changing the switch conditions, a new 8 -bit word is \nwritten to the input shift register. Some of the bits may be the same as the previous write cycle because  the user may no t \nchange the state of some switches . To minimize glitches on the \noutput of these switches, the devices compare the state of \nswitches from the previous write cycle. When  the switch es are \nalready in the on  condition and are required to stay on, there \nare minimal glitches on the output of the switch.  \nPOWER -ON RESET  \nOn power -up of the device, all switches are  in the off  condition , \nthe internal shift register is ﬁlled  with zeros , and the register \nremain s so until a valid write takes place.  \nSERIAL INTERFACE  \n3-Wir e Serial Interface  \nThe ADG714 has a 3 -wire serial interface ( SYNC , SCLK, and \nDIN), that is compatible wit h SPI, QSPI, MICROWIRE  interface  \nstandards , and most DSP  interface standards . Figure 3 shows \nthe timing dia gram of a typical write sequence.  \nData is written to the 8 -bit shift register via DIN under the \ncontrol of the SYNC  and SCLK signals. Data may be written to \nthe shift register in more or less than eight  bits. In each case , the \nshift regis ter retains the last eight  written bits. \nWhen SYNC  goes low, the input shift register is enabled. Data \nfrom DIN is clocked into the shift register on the falling edge of SCLK. Each bit of the 8 -bit word corresponds to one of the eight \nswitches. Figure 24 shows the contents of the input shift register. \nData appears on the DOUT pin on the rising edge of SCLK \nsuitable for daisy chaining , delayed by eight  bits. When all eight  \nbits have been written into the shift regi ster, the \nSYNC  line is \nbrought high again. The switches are updated with the new conﬁguration , and the input shift register is disabled. With \nSYNC  held high, the i nput shift register is disabled  so that \nfurther data or n oise on the DIN line has  no effect on the shift \nregister.  \nS8 S7 S6 S5 S4 S3 S2 S1DB7 (MSB ) DB0 (LSB)\nDATA BITS\n00043-023 \nFigure 24. Input Shift Register Contents  \n 2-Wire Serial Interface  \nThe ADG715 is controlled via an I2C-compatible serial bus. \nThis device is connected to the bus as a slave  device (no clock is \ngenerated by the switch).  \nThe ADG7 15 has a 7 -bit slave address. The ﬁve MSB s are 10010 \nand the two LSB s are determined  by the state of the A0 and A1 pins.  \nThe 2 -wire serial bus protocol operates as follows: \n1. The master initiates data transfer by establishing a start  \ncondition, which  is when  a high to low transition on the \nSDA line occurs while SCL is high. The fol lowing byte is \nthe address byte, which consists of a  7-bit slave address \nfollowed by a n R/W bit (this bit determines whether data is \nread from or written to the sl ave device).  \nThe slave whose address corresponds to the transmitted address responds by pulling the SDA line low during the \nninth clock pulse ( the pulling of SDA line  is termed the \nacknowledge bit). At this stage, all other devices on the bus \nremain idle w hile the selected device waits for data to be \nwritten to or read from its serial register. If the R/\nW bit is \nhigh, the master read s from the slave device. If the R/ W bit \nis low, the master writes to the slave device.  \n2. Data is transmitted over the serial bus in sequences of nine \nclock pulses (eight data bits followed by an acknowledge \nbit). The transitions on the SDA line must occur during the \nlow period of SCL and remain stable during the high \nperiod of SCL.  \n3. When all data bits are read or written, a stop  condition  is \nestablished by the master. A stop condition is deﬁned as a \nlow to high transition on the SDA line while SCL is high. \nIn write mode, the master pull s the SDA line high during \nthe tenth clock pulse to establish a  stop conditio n. In read \nmode, the master  issue s a no acknowledge  for the ninth \nclock pulse , and the SDA line remains high . The master \nbring s the SDA line low before the tenth clock pulse and \nthen high during the tenth clock pulse to establish a stop \ncondi tion.  \nSee Figure 25 for an ADG715 write sequence . \nA repeated write function gives the user the flexibility to update \nthe matrix switch a number of times after addressing the device  \nonly once. During the write cycle, each  data byte  update s the \nconﬁguration of the switches. For example, after the matrix \nswitch acknowledges  its address byte  and receive s one data byte, \nthe switches update after the data byte . If another data byte is \nwritten to the matrix switch while still in the same addressed \nslave device, this data byte also cause s a switch conﬁguration \nupdate. Repeat ing the  read of the matrix switch is also allowed.  \n \n  \nADG714/ ADG715  Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 18 of 21 Input Shift Register  \nThe input shift register is eight bits wide. Figure 24 illustrates \nthe contents of the input shift register. Data is loaded into the \ndevice as an 8 -bit word under the control of a serial clock input, \nSCL. The timing diagram for this operation is shown in Figure 4. \nThe 8-bit word co nsists of eight data bits, each controlling one \nswitch. MSB  (Bit 7) is loaded ﬁrst.  \nWrite Operation  \nWhen writing to the ADG715, the user begin s with an address \nbyte and an R/W bit, after which the switch acknowledge s that \nit is prepared to receive data by pulling SDA low. This address byte is fol lowed by the 8 -bit word. The write operatio n for the \nswitch is shown in  Figure 25. \nRead Operation  \nWhen reading data back from the ADG715, the user begin s \nwith an address byte and an R/W bit, after whi ch the switc h \nacknowledge s that it is prepared to transmit data by pulling \nSDA low. The readback operation is a single byte that consists of \nthe eight data bits in the input register. The read operation for \nthe switch  is shown in Figure 26. \n \n \nSCL\nSDA S8 S7 S6 S5 S4 S3 S2 S1 A0 R/W\nACK\nBY\nADG715ACK\nBY\nADG715START\nCOND\nBY\nMASTERSTOP\nCOND\nBY\nMASTERADDRESS BYTE DATA BYTEA1 1 1 0 0 0\n00043-024 \nFigure 25.

E | Page 19 of 21 APPLICATIONS  INFORMATION  \nMULTIPLE DEVICES O N ONE BUS  \nFigure 27 shows four ADG715 devices on the same serial bus. \nEach has a different slave address because the state of the A0 \nand A1 pins is different. This difference allows each switch to be \nwritten to or read from independently.  \nDAI SY-CHAINING  MULTIPLE ADG714  DEVICES  \nA number of ADG714 switches can  be daisy-chained  simply by \nusing the DOUT pin. Figure 28 shows a typical implementation. \nThe SYNC  pin of all three devices  in the example are tied \ntogether. When SYNC  is brought  low, the input shift r egisters  of \nall devices  are enabled, data is written to the devices via DIN  \nand clocked through the shift registers. When the transfer is  complete, SYNC  is brought high , and all switches are updated \nsimultaneously. Further shift registers  may be added in a series.  \nPOWER SUPPLY SEQUENCING  \nWhen using CMOS devices, take care to ensure correct power  \nsupply sequencing. Incorrect power supply sequencing can \nresult in the device s being sub jected to stresses beyond the \nabsolute maximum ratings lis ted in  Table 6. Digital and analog \ninputs are always  applied after pow er supplies and ground. In \ndual -supply applications, if digital or analog inputs are  applied \nto the devices prior to the V DD and V SS supplies, the addition of \na Schottky diode connected between V SS and GND ensure s that \nthe devices power  on correctly. For single -supply operation, V SS \nis tied to GND as close to the device s as possible.  \n \nSDA SCL\nA1\nA0A1\nA0A1\nA0A1\nA0\nADG715SDA SCL\nADG715SDA SCL\nADG715SDA SCL\nADG715SDA\nSCLMASTERRP RPVDD\nVDD VDD VDD\n00043-026 \nFigure 27.

E | Page 20 of 21 DECODING MULTIPLE AD G714 DEVICES  USING \nTHE  ADG739 \nUse the dual 4 -channel ADG739  multiplexer to multiplex a \nsingle chip select line to provide chip selects for up to four \ndevices on the SPI bus. Fi gure 29 illustrates the ADG739 and \nmultiple ADG714 devices  in such a typical configuration. All \ndevices receive the same serial clock and serial  data, but only \none device receives  the SYNC  signal at any one time. The \nADG739 is also a seria lly controlled device. One bit programmable  \npin of the microcontroller is used to enable the ADG739 via \nSYNC 2, while another bit programmable pin is used as the chip \nselect for the other serial devices, SYNC1 . Driving SYNC2  low \nenables changes to be made to the addressed serial devices. By \nbringing SYNC1  low, th e selected serial device hanging from \nthe SPI bus is  enabled , and data is clocked into the shift register \non the falling edges of SCLK. The design of the matrix switch \nallows for different combinations of the four serial devices to be \naddressed at any  one time. If more devices must  be addressed \nvia one chip select line, the ADG738, an 8-channel device , \nallow s further expansion of the chip select scheme. Note that \nthere is digital feedthrough fro m the digital input lines because \nSCLK and DIN are permanently connected to each device. \nUsing a burst clock minimize s the effects of this digital \nfeedthrough on the analog channels.
