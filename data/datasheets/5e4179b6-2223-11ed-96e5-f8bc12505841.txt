B | Page 8 of 12 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM3232E is a single-channel RS-232 line driver/receiver. \nStep-up voltage converters, coupled with level-shifting transmitters and receivers, allow RS-232 levels to be developed while operating \nfrom a single 3.3 V supply. \nCMOS technology is used to keep the power dissipation to an \nabsolute minimum, allowing maximum battery life in portable applications. \nCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe internal circuitry consists of the following main sections: \n• A charge pump voltage converter \n• A 3.3 V logic to RS-232 transmitter \n• An RS-232 to 3.3 V logic receiver \nCharge Pump Voltage Converter \nThe charge pump voltage converter consists of a 200 kHz \noscillator and a switching matrix. The converter generates a \n ±6.6 V supply from the input 3.3 V level. This is accomplished \nin two stages by using a switched capacitor technique as shown in Figure 10 . First, the 3.3 V input supply is doubled to 6.6 V by \nusing Capacitor C1 as the charge storage element. The +6.6 V level is then inverted to generate −6.6 V , using C2 as the storage element.  \nCapacitor C3 and Capacitor C4 are used to reduce the output \nripple. Their values are not critical and can be increased, if desired. \nCapacitor C3 is shown connected between V+ and V\nCC. It is also \nacceptable to connect this capacitor between V+ and GND. \nIf desired, larger capacitors (up to 10 μF) can be used for \nCapacitor C1 to Capacitor C4. \nC1+\nC2+C1–\nC2–VCC\nV–V+\nT1IN T1OUT\nT2IN T2OUT\nR1OUT R1IN\nR2OUT R2INTTL/CMOS\nINPUTSRS-232\nOUTPUTS\nTTL/CMOS\nOUTPUTSRS-232INPUTS*T1\nT2\nR1\nR2++\n+C1\n0.1µF\n10V\nC2\n0.1µF\n10V\nGNDADM3232E\nC30.1µF6.3V+3.3V INPU T\n+3.3V TO +6.6V\nVOLTAGE\nDOUBLER\n+6.6V TO –6.6V\nVOLTAGE\nINVERTERC5\n0.1µF\n+\nC40.1µF\n10V+\n*INTERNAL 5k Ω PULL-DOWN RESISTOR\n ON EACH RS-232 INPUT.5kΩ\n5kΩ\n06410-010 \nFigure 10.

Charge Pump Voltage Inverter \n3.3 V Logic to RS-232 Transmitter  \nThe drivers convert 3.3 V logic input levels into RS-232 output \nlevels. With V CC = 3.3 V and driving an RS-232 load, the output \nvoltage swing is typically ±6 V . \nRS-232 to 3.3 V Logic Receiver \nThe receivers are inverting level shifters that accept RS-232 input \nlevels and translate them into 3 V logic output levels. The inputs \nhave internal 5 kΩ pull-down resistors to ground and are pro-  \nt\nected against overvoltages up to ±30 V . Unconnected inputs \nar\ne pulled to 0 V by the internal 5 kΩ pull-down resistor. This \nresults in a Logic 1 output level for unconnected inputs or for \ninputs connected to GND. \nThe receivers have Schmitt trigger inputs with a hysteresis level \nof 0.4 V . This ensures error-free reception for both noisy inputs \nand for inputs with slow transition times. \nESD Protection on RS-232 Pins \nAll RS-232 (Tx OUT and Rx IN) inputs and outputs are protected \nagainst electrostatic discharges (up to ±15 kV). This ensures compliance with IEC 1000-4-2 requirements. \nHIGH BAUD RATE \nThe ADM3232E features high slew rates, permitting data trans-\nmission at rates well in excess of the EIA-232E specifications. \nRS-232 voltage levels are maintained at data rates up to 460 kbps, even under worst-case loading conditions. The slew rate is \ninternally controlled to less than 30 V/μs to minimize EMI \ninterference.  \n \n \n  ADM3232E\n \nRev.
