The flat cable is flexible and convenient to manipulate. It must be kept as short as \npossible to not impact the signal quality. Even if SF600  and SF600 Plus strong buffers can \ndrive high capacitance, the communication failure  can occur due to weaker driving \ncapability of the on board Serial Flash. In case of communication problems, try to reduce \nthe bus frequency from the software interface.  \n \nFor customization of the ICP -cable (number of signals, pin out assignment or connecto r \nsize), please contact DediProg .

If your application has been designed for the SF100, DediProg is providing \nwith the SF600  and SF600 Plus an adaptor to be backward compatible.  \n \n2.3.2 Application Universal Header  \nFor new application design, DediProg strongly recommend to implement the universal \nHeader so you can benefit of all the development tools available and future features of \nthe Serial Flash and controllers.  \n- One or two Serial Flash programming  \n- Single, dual and Quad IO programming  \n- Controller Reset mode  \n \nTable 5: Universal Pin H eader for application design  \n1 Vpp CS2 2 \n3 CS1 Vcc 4 \n5 MISO/DQ1  Hold/DQ3  6 \n7 Wp/DQ2  CLK 8 \n9 GND  MOSI/DQ0  10 \n11 NC Reset  12 \n*NC: Not connected  \n \nIt is recommended to keep the Header 2*6 even if some signals are unused (Vpp, CS2, \nHold, Wp, reset). The h eader will stay compatible with the female connector supplied \nby default with the SF600  and SF600 Plus. \n \nPin 11 can be used as insertion mistake proof pin. To support this protection of wrong \ninsertion, the pin 11 has to be cut in the application and the co rresponding hole of the \ncable connector must be filled accordingly.  \n \n2.3.3 Pin Header pitch  \nThe default cable and female connector provided with SF600  and SF600 Plus is a \n2.54mm pitch.  \nFor space saving reason, you may decide to implement a 1.27mm pitch conn ector on \nyour application board. DediProg proposes an adaptor board to convert from 2.54mm \nto 1.27mm.  \n \n                                      SF600 /SF600 Plus  Serial Flash Programming  solution  Specification  \n                                                                                                 \nwww.dediprog.com                                                                                                                                        8 \nIII. Programming methods  \n3.1 In Circuit Programming  \nThe SF600  and SF600 Plus programmer s have been designed to meet the strong and \ngrowing demand of serial fla sh users to program and update the memories soldered on \nboard during development, production, and field manipulation or repairing with high \nperformance and low cost.  \n \nImportant:  \nSocket adaptor and In Circuit Programming cannot be used in the same time. To use the \nIn Circuit programming, the socket adaptor has to be removed.  \n \nSF600  and SF600 Plus can support dual and quad IO programming offering the shortest \nprogramming time even if the application board total capacitance do not permit high \nfrequency.  \n \nBefore  trying to update the Serial Flash soldered on Board, make sure that the SPI \ncontroller and the application are compatible with the In Circuit Programming method to \navoid any conflict with the programmer.  \n \nFig 3: SF600 /SF600Plus  connected to the applicatio n header  \n \n \n3.2 SPI bus in High Impedance  \nThe SF600/SF600 Plus reset  signal  can be used  to reset  the target  board  and switch the \napplication controller in reset mode.  User must  check if  the SPI bus is released in high \nimpedance  during  this mode  to prevent  any conflict  between the programmer  and the \napplication  controller. In this mode,  the on board flash is supplied by the application.  \n \n3.3 SPI bus isolation circuit  \nIf the application controller does  not release  the SPI bus in high impedance  during  reset  \nthen an isolation circuit (MOSFET,  switch,  multiplexer ...) must be designed  in order  to \nisolate  the programmer  and serial  flash from the application controller  during  the \nupdate.  \n \n\n                                      SF600 /SF600 Plus  Serial Flash Programming  solution  Specification  \n                                                                                                 \nwww.dediprog.com                                                                                                                                        9 \nDediProg  has published  an Application  Note and reference  schematic to help  designers to \nimplement  the In Circuit  Programming  method  and will be pleased  to answer  any of your  \nquestions on this subject.  \n \nCode  programming  or Update  flexibility:  \n- For code  trials  during  Research  and Development  (R&D)  \n- For Production programming  \n- For applicat ion code update  or customization  in warehouse  \n- For repairing or update in the field  \n \n3.4 Backup Boot Flash method  \nSF600  / SF600 Plus can also be used together with DediProg  backup  boot  flash  modules so \nthat it forces  the application  to boot  from  the backup  flash located  in the backup  boot  \nflash module instead of the soldered SPI flash on  the application which  it is disabled. The  \nbackup  serial  flash  can then  be accessed  at any time  by the SF600  / SF600 Plus without  \nany possible  conflict  with  the application  controller.  In this case,  SF600 / SF600 Plus \ncann ot update  directly  the on board  Serial  Flash  to avoid  conflict  with  the controller.  \n \nApplications:  \nA. Development purpose as the system can boot from the backup Flash for the code \ntrials. Engineer can update safely  the backup Flash with new code and without any \nconflict risk with the application controller.  \nB. Repair purpose  as the system can still boot from a backup memory even if the on \nboard Serial flash is corrupted.

The ICP cable  length  must be reduced  at the minimum. The SPI flash  \noutput  buffer  capability  (MISO)  is limited  compared  to the programmer  performances.  \nSo even if the programmer  is able  to drive high capacitance,  the Serial  Flash soldered \non the application will probably  not (information  read from SPI Flash  will be wrong).  \n \nC. Smart management of the SPI Flash Vcc and SPI signals  \nIn order  to minimize the impact of the ICP method  on the chipset and application  \nboard, the programmer  supplies  the application  Serial  Flash with  Vcc and SPI signals  \nonly  during  the programmer and Serial Flash operations.  \nAdvantages:  \na) The programmer is plugged  on the application  board  with  Vcc OFF and SPI \nsignals in  High  Impedance to avoid  inrush  current.  \nb) All the ICP pins are protected  with  ESD high  performance protections  to \ndischarge  the Electronics  charge before  the connection and protect  the \napplication.  \nc) The Serial  Flash  Vcc and SPI signals are  provided  only  when  the user  send  the \ncommand and are switched OFF automatically when  the operation  is completed. \nTherefore, the programmer  is transparent for the application  and can be kept  \nconnected  during  application  trials.  \n \nD. High voltage supply: Vpp/Acc  \nSpecification for the Vpp pin  \nVpp = 5V to 12V  \nIpp max  = 70mA  \nThe Vpp high  voltage  can be supplied  by the programmer  and used to speed up  \nprogramming  and erasing of the application Serial Flash if  this feature  is supported  \nby the Serial Flash supplier.  \nThe Vpp supply  will be applie d automatically  by the programmer  on the Vpp pin \nonly  during erase, write, or programming  operations and only if the Vpp option has \nbeen  enabled on the software.  The programmer  will also control  the Vpp voltage  \nlevel  according  to the Serial Flash  connected  and its specification.  \n \nE. I/O management: IO1, IO2, Reset /IO3  \nTwo general IO are available on the ICP connector  and one Reset for custom \nneeds.  The IOs and reset  are in High  Impedance (HZ) state if there is no software \noperation  ongoing.  \n                                      SF600 /SF600 Plus  Serial Flash Programming  solution  Specification  \n                                                                                                 \nwww.dediprog.com                                                                                                                                        19 \n \nReset /IO3 : The res et/IO3  pin is an open drain output which can be used to reset \nthe target system  or turn off the isolation circuit.  \n \n \n \nFig 1 1: Circuit diagram:  \n \nIO: The IO signals  are in input  mode by default .
