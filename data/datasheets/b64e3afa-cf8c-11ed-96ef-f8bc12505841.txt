#### Description:
The ZMCT116A is a small-sized current transformer designed for high-accuracy current and power measurement applications. It operates by allowing the measured circuit to pass through its core, providing a secondary output that is proportional to the primary input current. The transformer features a high turns ratio of 2500:1, which allows for effective scaling of the current measurement.

#### Typical Applications:
The ZMCT116A is primarily used in:
- Current and power measurement systems
- Energy monitoring devices
- Industrial automation and control systems
- Electrical safety and protection devices
- Any application requiring precise current sensing and monitoring

This component is particularly useful in scenarios where accurate current measurement is critical, such as in power management systems and energy efficiency monitoring.
