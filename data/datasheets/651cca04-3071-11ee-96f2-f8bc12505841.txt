The L TC2450 uses a single 2.7V to 5.5V supply, accepts a single-ended analog input voltage, and commu-nicates through an SPI interface. It includes an integrated oscillator that does not require any external components. It uses a delta-sigma modulator as a converter core and provides single-cycle settling time for multiplexed applica-tions. The converter is available in a 6-pin, 2mm × 2mm \nDFN package. The internal oscillator does not require any external components. The L TC2450 includes a proprietary input sampling scheme that reduces the average input sampling current several orders of magnitude.\nThe L TC2450 is capable of up to 30 conversions per sec-\nond and, due to the very large oversampling ratio, has extremely relaxed antialiasing requirements. The L TC2450 includes continuous internal offset and full-scale calibra-tion algorithms which are transparent to the user , ensuring accuracy over time and over the operating temperature range. The converter uses its power supply voltage as the reference voltage and the single-ended, rail-to-rail input voltage range extends from GND to V\nCC.\nFollowing a conversion, the L TC2450 can automatically \nenter a sleep mode and reduce its power to less than 200nA. If the user samples the ADC once a second, the L TC2450 consumes an average of less than 50μW from a 2.7V supply.n GND to V CC Single-Ended Input Range\nn 0.02LSB RMS Noise\nn 2LSB INL, No Missing Codes\nn 2LSB Offset Error\nn 4LSB Full-Scale Error\nn Single Conversion Settling Time for Multiplexed \nApplications\nn Single Cycle Operation with Auto Shutdown\nn 350μA Supply Current\nn 50nA Sleep Current\nn 30 Conversions Per Second \nn Internal Oscillator—No External Components \nRequired\nn Single Supply, 2.7V to 5.5V Operation\nn SPI Interface\nn Ultra-Tiny 2mm × 2mm DFN Package\nn System Monitoring\nn Environmental Monitoring\nn Direct Temperature Measurements\nn Instrumentation\nn Industrial Process Control\nn Data Acquisition\nn Embedded ADC Upgrades\nIntegral Nonlinearity, V CC = 3VL, L T , L TC and L TM are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation.

Its operation is composed of three successive states: CONVERT , SLEEP and DATA OUTPUT . The operat-ing cycle begins with the CONVERT state, is followed by the SLEEP state and ends with the DATA OUTPUT state (see Figure 2). The 3-wire interface consists ofserial data output (SDO), serial clock input (SCK) and the active low chip select input ( CS). \nThe CONVERT state duration is determined by the L TC2450 \nconversion time (nominally 33.3 milliseconds). Once started, this operation can not be aborted except by a low power supply condition (V\nCC < 2.1V) which generates an \ninternal power-on reset signal.\nAfter the completion of a conversion, the L TC2450 enters \nthe SLEEP state and remains here until both the chip select and clock inputs are low ( CS = SCK = LOW). Fol-\nlowing this condition the ADC transitions into the DATA OUTPUT state. \nFigure 2. L TC2450 State T ransition DiagramAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nWhile in the SLEEP state, whenever the chip select input is pulled high ( CS = HIGH), the L TC2450’s power supply \ncurrent is reduced to less than 200nA. When the chip select input is pulled low ( CS = LOW), and SCK is maintained \nat a HIGH logic level, the L TC2450 will return to a normal power consumption level. During the SLEEP state, the result of the last conversion is held indeﬁ  nitely in a static \nregister .\nUpon entering the DATA OUTPUT state, SDO outputs the \nmost signiﬁ  cant bit (D15) of the conversion result. During \nthis state, the ADC shifts the conversion result serially through the SDO output pin under the control of the SCK input pin. There is no latency in generating this result and it corresponds to the last completed conversion. A new bit of data appears at the SDO pin following each falling edge detected at the SCK input pin. The user can reliably latch this data on every rising edge of the external serial clock signal driving the SCK pin (see Figure 3).\nThe DATA OUTPUT state concludes in one of two dif-\nferent ways. First, the DATA OUTPUT state operation is completed once all 16 data bits have been shifted out and the clock then goes low, which corresponds to the 16\nth \nfalling edge of SCK. Second, the DATA OUTPUT state can be aborted at any time by a LOW-to-HIGH transition on the CS input. Following either one of these two actions, \nthe L TC2450 will enter the CONVERT state and initiate a new conversion cycle.\nPower-Up Sequence\nWhen the power supply voltage V\nCC applied to the con-\nverter is below approximately 2.1V , the ADC performs a power-on reset. This feature guarantees the integrity of the conversion result.\nWhen V\nCC rises above this critical threshold, the converter \ngenerates an internal power-on reset (POR) signal for approximately 0.5ms. The POR signal clears all internal registers. Following the POR signal, the L TC2450 starts a conversion cycle and follows the succession of states described in Figure 2. The ﬁ  rst conversion result fol-lowing POR is accurate within the speciﬁ  cations of the \ndevice if the power supply voltage V\nCC is restored within \nthe operating range (2.7V to 5.5V) before the end of the POR time interval.DATA OUTPUTSLEEPCONVERTPOWER-ON RESET\nYES\n2450 F0216TH FALLING\nEDGE OF SCK\nOR\nCS = HIGH?SCK = LOW\nAND\nCS = LOW?\nNO YESNO\nLTC2450\n82450fbAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nthis range. Thus the converter resolution remains at 1LSB \nindependent of the reference voltage. INL, offset, and full-scale errors vary with the reference voltage as indicated by the Typical Performance Characteristics graphs. These error terms will decrease with an increase in the reference voltage (as the LSB size in μV increases).\nInput Voltage Range\nThe ADC is capable of digitizing true rail-to-rail input sig-\nnals. Ignoring offset and full-scale errors, the converter will theoretically output an “all zero” digital result when the input is at ground (a zero scale input) and an “all one” digital result when the input is at V\nCC (a full-scale input).\nThe converter offset and gain error speciﬁ  cations ensure \nthat all 65536 possible codes will be produced within this voltage range. In an under-range condition, for all input voltages less than the voltage corresponding to output code 0, the converter will generate the output code 0. In an over-range condition, for all input voltages greater than the voltage corresponding to output code 65535 the converter will generate the output code 65535.\nOutput Data FormatThe L TC2450 generates a 16-bit direct binary encoded \nresult. It is provided, MSB ﬁ  rst, as a 16-bit serial stream \nthrough the SDO output pin under the control of the SCK input pin (see Figure 3).Ease of Use\nThe L TC2450 data output has no latency, ﬁ  lter settling delay \nor redundant results associated with the conversion cycle. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the conver-sion and the output data. Therefore, multiplexing multiple analog input voltages requires no special actions.\nThe L TC2450 performs offset and full-scale calibrations \nevery conversion. This calibration is transparent to the user and has no effect upon the cyclic operation described previously. The advantage of continuous calibration is extreme stability of the ADC performance with respect to time and temperature.\nThe L TC2450 includes a proprietary input sampling scheme \nthat reduces the average input current several orders of magnitude as compared to traditional delta sigma archi-tectures. This allows external ﬁ  lter networks to interface \ndirectly to the L TC2450. Since the average input sampling current is 50nA, an external RC lowpass ﬁ  lter using a 1k Ω \nand 0.1μF results in <1LSB error .\nReference Voltage Range\nThe converter uses the power supply voltage (V\nCC) as the \npositive reference voltage (see Figure 1). Thus, the refer-ence range is the same as the power supply range, which extends from 2.7V to 5.5V . The L TC2450’s internal noise level is extremely low so the output peak-to-peak noise remains well below 1LSB for any reference voltage within \nFigure 3.

The data output process starts \nwith the most signiﬁ  cant bit of the result being present \nat the SDO output pin (SDO = D15) once CS goes low. A \nnew data bit appears at the SDO output pin following every falling edge detected at the SCK input pin. The output data can be latched by the user using the rising edge of SCK. \nConversion Status Monitor\nFor certain applications, the user may wish to monitor \nthe L TC2450 conversion status. This can be achieved by holding SCK HIGH during the conversion cycle. In this condition, whenever the CS input pin is pulled low\n(CS = LOW), the SDO output pin will provide an indication \nof the conversion status. SDO = HIGH is an indication of a conversion cycle in progress while SDO = LOW is an indication of a completed conversion cycle. An example of such a sequence is shown in Figure 4.\nConversion status monitoring, while possible, is not re-\nquired for L TC2450 as its conversion time is ﬁ  xed and equal \nat approximately 33.3ms (42ms maximum). Therefore, external timing can be used to determine the completion of aconversion cycle. \nSERIAL INTERFACE\nThe L TC2450 transmits the conversion result and receives \nthe start of conversion command through a synchronous 3-wire interface. This interface can be used during the APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nCONVERT and SLEEP states to assess the conversionstatus and during the DATA OUTPUT state to read theconversion result, and to trigger a new conversion.\nSerial Interface Operation Modes\nThe following are a few of the more common interface \noperation examples. Many more valid control and serial data output operation sequences can be constructed based upon the above description of the function of the three digital interface pins.\nThe modes of operation can be summarized as follows:1) The L TC2450 functions with SCK idle high (commonly \nknown as CPOL = 1) or idle low (commonly known as CPOL = 0).\n2) After the 16th bit is read, the user can choose one of \ntwo ways to begin a new conversion. First, one can pull CS high ( CS = ↑). Second, one can use a high-low \ntransition on SCK (SCK = ↓).\n3) In a similar vein, at any time during the Data Output \nstate, pulling CS high ( CS = ↑) causes the part to leave \nthe I/O state, abort the output and begin a new conver-sion.\n4) When SCK = HIGH, it is possible to monitor the conver-\nsion status by pulling CS low and watching for SDO to \ngo low. This feature is available only in the idle-high (CPOL = 1) mode.\nFigure 4.

The user can monitor the conversion status at convenient intervals using CS and SDO. \nCS is pulled low to test whether or not the chip is in \nthe CONVERT state. While in the CONVERT state, SDO is HIGH while CS is LOW . In the SLEEP state, SDO is \nLOW while CS is LOW . These tests are not required op-\nerational steps but may be useful for some applications.\nWhen the data is available, the user applies 16 clock cycles \nto transfer the result. The CS rising edge is then used to \ninitiate a new conversion.\nThe operation example of Figure 6 is identical to that of \nFigure 5, except the new conversion cycle is triggered by the falling edge of the serial clock (SCK). A 17th clock \npulse is used to trigger a new conversion cycle.\nSerial Clock Idle-Low (CPOL = 0) Examples\nIn Figure 7, following a conversion cycle the L TC2450 \nautomatically enters the low power sleep state. The user determines data availability (and the end of conversion) \nbased upon external timing. The user then pulls CS low\n(CS = ↓) and uses 16 clock cycles to transfer the result. \nFollowing the 16th rising edge of the clock, CS is pulled high\n(CS = ↑), which triggers a new conversion.\nThe timing diagram in Figure 8 is identical to that of Figure 7, \nexcept in this case a new conversion is triggered by SCK.  \nThe 16th SCK falling edge triggers a new conversion cycle \nand the CS signal is subsequently pulled high.\nFigure 5.

If the L TC2450 is in the \ndata output state, a CS rising edge clears the remaining data \nbits from memory, aborts the output cycle and triggers a new conversion. Figure 9 shows an example of aborting an I/O with idle-high (CPOL = 1) and Figure 10 shows an example of aborting an I/O with idle-low (CPOL = 0).\nA new conversion cycle can be triggered using the CS \nsignal without having to generate any serial clock pulses as shown in Figure 11. If SCK is maintained at a LOW logic level, after the end of a conversion cycle, a new conversion operation can be triggered by pulling CS low \nand then high. When CS is pulled low ( CS = LOW), SDO \nwill output the most signiﬁ  cant bit (D15) of the result of \nthe just completed conversion. While a low logic level is \nmaintained at SCK pin and CS is subsequently pulled high \n(CS = HIGH) the remaining 15 bits of the result (D14:D0) \nare discarded and a new conversion cycle starts.\nFollowing the aborted I/O, additional clock pulses in the \nCONVERT state are acceptable, but excessive signal tran-sitions on SCK can potentially create noise on the ADC during the conversion, and thus may negatively inﬂ  uence \nthe conversion accuracy.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nD15 D14 D13 D12 D2 D1 D0SD0\nclk1 clk2 clk3 clk4 clk15 clk15 clk16SCK\nCONVERT CONVERT SLEEP\nLOW I CCDATA OUTPUT\n2450 F08CS\nFigure 8.

In addition the option to abort serial data transfers is no longer available. Hardwire CS to GND for 2-wire operation.\nFigure 12 shows a 2-wire operation sequence which uses \nan idle-high (CPOL = 1) serial clock signal. The conversion status can be monitored at the SDO output. Following a conversion cycle, the ADC enters SLEEP state and the SDO output transitions from HIGH to LOW . Subsequently 16 clock pulses are applied to the SCK input in order to serially shift the 16 bit result. Finally, the 17th clock pulse is applied to the SCK input in order to trigger a new conversion cycle.Figure 13 shows a 2-wire operation sequence which uses \nan idle-low (CPOL = 0) serial clock signal. The conversion status cannot be monitored at the SDO output. Following a conversion cycle, the L TC2450 bypasses the SLEEP state and immediately enters the DATA OUTPUT state. At this moment the SDO pin outputs the most signiﬁ  cant bit (D15) of the conversion result. The user must use external timing in order to determine the end of conversion and result availability. Subsequently 16 clock pulses are applied to SCK in order to serially shift the 16-bit result. The 16th clock falling edge triggers a new conversion cycle.\nPRESERVING THE CONVERTER ACCURACY\nThe L TC2450 is designed to reduce as much as possible \nthe conversion result sensitivity to device decoupling, PCB layout, antialiasing circuits, line and frequencyperturbations. Nevertheless, in order to preserve the very high accuracy capability of this part, some simpleprecautions are desirable.\nLTC2450\n142450fbAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nDigital Signal Levels\nThe L TC2450’s digital interface is easy to use. Its digital \ninputs (SCK and CS) accept standard CMOS logic levels \nand the internal hysteresis receivers can tolerate edge rates as slow as 100μs. However , some considerations are required to take advantage of the exceptional accuracy and low supply current of this converter .\nThe digital output signal SDO is less of a concern because \nit is not active during the conversion cycle.\nWhile a digital input signal is in the range 0.5V to V\nCC \n–0.5V , the CMOS input receiver may draw additional\ncurrent from the power supply. Due to the nature of CMOS logic, a slow transition within this voltage range may cause an increase in the power supply current drawn by the converter , particularly in the low power operation mode within the SLEEP state. Thus, for low power consumption it is highly desirable to provide relatively fast edges for the two digital input pins SCK and CS, and to keep the digital \ninput logic levels at V\nCC or GND.\nAt the same time, during the CONVERT state, undershoot \nand/or overshoot of fast digital signals connected to the L TC2450 pins may alter the conversion result. Under-shoot and overshoot can occur because of an impedance mismatch at the converter pin combined with very fast transition times. This problem becomes particularly difﬁ  cult \nwhen shared control lines are used and multiple reﬂ  ec-\ntions may occur . The solution is to carefully terminate all transmission lines close to their characteristic impedance. Parallel termination is seldom an acceptable option in low power systems so a series resistor between 27 Ω and 56Ω \nplaced near the driver may eliminate this problem. The actual resistor value depends upon the trace impedance and connection topology. An alternate solution is to reduce the edge rate of the control signals, keeping in mind the concerns regarding slow edges mentioned above.\nParticular attention should be given to conﬁ  gurations in \nwhich a continuous clock signal is applied to SCK pin during the CONVERT state. While L TC2450 will ignore this signal from a logic point of view the signal edges may create unexpected errors depending upon the relation between its frequency and the internal oscillator frequency. In such a situation it is beneﬁ  cial to use edge rates of about 10ns and to limit potential undershoot to less than 0.3V below \nGND and overshoot to less than 0.3V above V\nCC.\nNoisy external circuitry can potentially impact the output \nunder 2-wire operation. In particular , it is possible to get the L TC2450 into an unknown state if an SCK pulse is missed or noise triggers an extra SCK pulse. In this situ-ation, it is impossible to distinguish SDO = 1 (indicating conversion in progress) from valid “1” data bits. As such, CPOL = 1 is recommended for the 2-wire mode. The user should look for SDO = 0 before reading data, and look for SDO = 1 after reading data. If SDO does not return a “0” within the maximum conversion time (or return a “1” after a full data read), generate 16 SCK pulses to force a new conversion.\nDriving V\nCC and GND\nThe V CC and GND pins of the L TC2450 converter are \ndirectly connected to the positive and negative reference voltages, respectively. A simpliﬁ  ed equivalent circuit is \nshown in Figure 14.\nThe power supply current passing through the parasitic \nlayout resistance associated with these common pins will modify the ADC reference voltage and thus negatively affect the converter accuracy. It is thus important to keep the V\nCC and GND lines quiet, and to connect these supplies \nthrough very low impedance traces.\nIn relation to the V CC and GND pins, the L TC2450 com-\nbines internal high frequency decoupling with damping\nFigure 14.

L TC2450 Input Drive Equivalent Circuitelements which reduce the ADC performance sensitivity to \nPCB layout and external components. Nevertheless, the very high accuracy of this converter is best preserved by careful low and high frequency power supply decoupling.\nA 0.1μF , high quality, ceramic capacitor in parallel with a \n10μF ceramic capacitor should be connected between the V\nCC and GND pins, as close as possible to the package. \nThe 0.1μF capacitor should be placed closest to the ADC package. It is also desirable to avoid any via in the circuit path starting from the converter V\nCC pin, passing through \nthese two decoupling capacitors and returning to the converter GND pin. The area encompassed by this circuit path, as well as the path length, should be minimized. \nVery low impedance ground and power planes and star \nconnections at both V\nCC and GND pins are preferable. The \nVCC pin should have two distinct connections: the ﬁ  rst to the \ndecoupling capacitors described above and the second to the power supply voltage. The GND pin should have three distinct connections: the ﬁ  rst to the decoupling capacitors \ndescribed above, the second to the ground return for the input signal source and the third to the ground return for the power supply voltage source.\nDriving V\nIN\nThe V IN input drive requirements can be best analyzed \nusing the equivalent circuit of Figure 15. The input signal V\nSIG is connected to the ADC input pin V IN through an \nequivalent source resistance R S. This resistor includes \nboth the actual generator source resistance and any additional optional resistor connected to the V\nIN pin. An \noptional input capacitor C IN is also connected to the ADC \nVIN pin. This capacitor is placed in parallel with the ADC \ninput parasitic capacitance C PAR. Depending upon the PCB layout C PAR has typical values between 2pF and 15pF . In \naddition, the equivalent circuit of Figure 15 includes the converter equivalent internal resistor R\nSW and sampling \ncapacitor C EQ.\nThere are some immediate trade-offs in R S and C IN without \nneeding a full circuit analysis. Increasing R S and C IN can \ngive the following beneﬁ  ts: \n1) Due to the L TC2450’s input sampling algorithm, the \ninput current drawn by V IN over a conversion cycle is \n50nA. A high R S • CIN attenuates the high frequency \ncomponents of the input current, and R S values up to \n1kΩ result in <1LSB error .\n2) The bandwidth from V SIG is reduced at V IN.This band-\nwidth reduction isolates the ADC from high frequency signals, and as such provides simple antialiasing and input noise reduction.\n3) Noise generated by the ADC is attenuated before it goes \nback to the signal source. \n4) A large C\nIN gives a better AC ground at V IN, helping \nreduce reﬂ  ections back to the signal source.\n5) Increasing R S protects the ADC by limiting the current \nduring an outside-the-rails fault condition. R S can be \neasily sized such as to protect against even extreme fault conditions.\nThere is a limit to how large R\nS • CIN should be for a given \napplication. Increasing R S beyond a given point increases \nthe voltage drop across R S due to the input current, to \nthe point that signiﬁ  cant measurement errors exist. Ad-\nditionally, for some applications, increasing the R S • CIN \nproduct too much may unacceptably attenuate the signal at frequencies of interest.\nCEQ\n0.35pF\n(TYP)RSW\n15k\n(TYP)\nILEAKILEAKVCC\nRS\nCINVSIG CPARVCC\nICONV\n2450 F15VIN\n+–\nLTC2450\n162450fbAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 16. Measured INL vs Input Voltage, \nCIN = 0.1μF , V CC = 5V , T A = 25°CFor most applications, it is desirable to implement C IN as \na high quality 0.1μF ceramic capacitor and R S ≤ 1k. This \ncapacitor should be located as close as possible to the actual V\nIN package pin. Furthermore the area encompassed \nby this circuit path as well as the path length should be minimized.\nIn the case of a 2-wire sensor which is not remotely \ngrounded, it is desirable to split R\nS and place series\nresistors in the ADC input line as well as in the sensor ground return line which should be tied to the ADC GND pin using a star connection topology.\nFigure 16 shows the measured L TC2450 INL vs In-\nput Voltage as a function of R\nS value with an input\ncapacitor C IN = 0.1μF . \nIn some cases, R S can be increased above these guidelines. \nIn the case of the L TC2450, in the ﬁ  rst half of the CONVERT \nstate, the internal calibration algorithm maintains I AV \nstrictly at zero. Each half of the CONVERT state is about 16.67ms. Additionally, the input current is zero while the ADC is either in sleep or I/O modes. Thus, if the time \nconstant of the input R-C circuit τ = R\nS • C IN is of the \nsame order magnitude or longer than the time periods between actual conversions, then one can consider the input current to be reduced correspondingly.\nThese considerations need to be balanced out by the input \nsignal bandwidth. The 3dB bandwidth ≅ 1/(2π R\nS CIN). \nFinally, if the recommended choice for C IN is unacceptable \nfor the user’s speciﬁ  c application, an alternate strategy is to \neliminate C IN and minimize C PAR and R S. In practical terms, \nthis conﬁ  guration corresponds to a low impedance sensor \ndirectly connected to the ADC through minimum length traces. Actual applications include current measurements through low value sense resistors, temperature measure-ments, low impedance voltage source monitoring and so on. The resultant INL vs V\nIN is shown in Figure 17. The \nmeasurements of Figure 17 include a C PAR capacitor cor-\nresponding to a minimum size layout pad and a minimum width input trace of about 1 inch length.\nFigure 17.

Then, the total system noise level can \nbe estimated as the square root of the sum of (V n2) and \nthe square of the L TC2450 noise ﬂ  oor (≈2 μV2).\nAliasing\nThe L TC2450 signal acquisition circuit is a sampled data \nsystem and as such suffers from input signal aliasing. As can be seen from Figure 19, due to the very high over-sample ratios the high frequency input signal attenuation is reasonably good. Nevertheless a continuous timeantialiasing ﬁ  lter connected at the input will preserve \nthe converter accuracy when the input signal includes undesirable high frequency components. The antialias-ing function can be accomplished using the R\nS and C IN \ncomponents shown in Figure 15 sized such that τ = R S \n• CIN > 450ns. \nFigure 18.
