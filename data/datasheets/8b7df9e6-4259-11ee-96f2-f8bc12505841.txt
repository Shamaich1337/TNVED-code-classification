The RFMD2080 can generate output frequen-\ncies of between 45MHz and 2700MHz, making it  suitable for a wide range of applications. \nThe fractional-N synthesizer takes advantage of an advanced sigma-delta architecture that\ndelivers ultra-fine step sizes and low spurious products. The synthesizer/VCO combined with an\nexternal loop filter allows the user to generate an oscillator signal covering 90MHz to 5400MHz.The signal is buffered and routed to a high accuracy quadrature divider (/2) that drives the bal-\nanced I and Q mixers. The output of the mixers are summed and applied to a differential RF out-\nput stage. The device also features a differential input for an external VCO or LO source.\nThe baseband I and Q stages are highly integrated; featuring variable gain and filtering as well\nas generation of DC offset voltages. The programmable DC offsets enable improved carrier sup-\npression. The baseband input 3dB bandwidth can be tuned from 1.5MHz to 10MHz, and the\ntotal gain control range is 38dB with 2dB resolution.\nDevice programming is achieved via a simple 3-wire serial interface. In addition, a unique pro-\ngramming mode allows up to four devices to be controlled from a common serial bus. This elim-\ninates the need for separate chip-select control lines between each device and the hostcontroller. Up to six general purpose outputs are provided, which can be used to access internal\nsignals (the LOCK signal, for example) or to control front end components. The device is opti-\nmized for low power operation, consuming typically only 155mA from a 3V supply.Features\n\uf06eRF Output Frequency Range \n45MHz to 2700MHz\n\uf06eFractional-N Synthesizer with Very Low Spurious Levels\n\uf06eTypical Step Size 1.5Hz\n\uf06eFully Integrated Wideband VCOs and LO Buffers\n\uf06eIntegrated Phase Noise <0.2° rms at 1GHz\n\uf06eIntegrated Baseband Amplification Stage with Variable Gain and Filtering\n\uf06eTunable Baseband Filters Input 3dB Bandwidth from 1.5MHz to 10MHz\n\uf06e-45dBc Unadjusted Carrier Suppression\n\uf06e-40dBc Unadjusted Sideband Suppression\n\uf06eVery Low Noise Floor              -150dBm/Hz Typical\n\uf06eOutput P1dB +4dBm\n\uf06eOutput IP3 +18dBm\n\uf06e3.0V to 3.3V Power Supply\n\uf06e155mA Typical Current Consumption\n\uf06eSerial Programming Interface\nApplications\n\uf06eSatellite Communications\n\uf06eQPSK/QAM Modulators\n\uf06eSSB Modulators\n\uf06eSoftware Defined Radios\nDS140110Package: QFN, 32-Pin, 5mm x 5mm\nRFMD2080\n2 of 19RFMD2080\nDS1401107628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570 or sales-support@rfmd.com.Absolute Maximum Ratings\nParameter Rating Unit\nSupply Voltage (VDD) -0.5 to +3.6 V\nInput Voltage (VIN), any pin -0.3 to VDD+0.3 V\nLO Input Power +15 dBm\nOperating Temperature Range -40 to +85 °C\nStorage Temperature Range -65 to +150 °C\nParameterSpecificationUnit ConditionMin.

It features a\nhigh accuracy LO quadrature divider followed by buffer circuits  which drive the I and Q mixers of the modulator with the quadra -\nture LO signals. The RFMD2080 has an integrated voltage reference and low drop out regulators supplying critical circuit\nblocks such as the VCOs and synthesizer.  Synthesizer programming, device configuration and control are achieved through a\nmixture of hardware and software controls. All on-chip register s are programmed through a simple  three-wire serial interface.\nVCO\nThe VCO core in the RFMD2080 consists of three VCOs which, in conjunction with the integrated LO dividers of /1 to /32, cover\nthe frequency range of 90MHz to 5400MHz. The modulator quadrature divider provides a further fixed divide by two to give the\ncenter frequency range at the modulator output of 45MHz to 2700MHz.\nEach VCO has 128 overlapping bands which are used to achiev e low VCO gain and optimal phase noise performance across\nthe whole tuning range. The chip automatically selects the correct VCO (VCO auto-select) and the correct VCO band (VCO\ncoarse tuning) to generate the desired LO frequency based on the values programmed into the PLL1 and PLL2 registers banks. \nThe VCO auto-select and VCO coarse tuning are triggered every time  ENBL is taken high, or if the PLL re-lock self clearing bit is\nprogrammed high. Once the correct VCO and band have been sele cted the PLL will lock onto the correct frequency. During the\nband selection process fixed capacitance elements are progressi vely connected to the VCO resonant circuit until the VCO is\noscillating at approximately the correct frequency. The output of  this band selection, CT_CAL, is made available in the read-\nback register. If this was unsuccessful it will be indicated by  the CT_FAILED flag also available in the read-back register. A value\nbetween 1 and 126 indicates a successful calibration, the actual  value being dependent on the desired frequency as well as\nprocess variation for a particular device. \nThe band select process will center the VCO tuning voltage at about 0.8V, compensating for manufacturing tolerances and pro-\ncess variation as well as environmental factors including temperat ure. In applications where the device is left enabled at the\nsame LO frequency for some time it is recommended that au tomatic band selection be performed for every 30°C change in\ntemperature. This assumes an active loop filter. \nThe RFMD2080 features a differential LO input to allow the mixer to  be driven from an external LO source. The fractional-N PLL\ncan be used with an external VCO driven into this LO input, which may be useful to reduce phase noise in some applications.\nThis may also require an external op-amp, dependant on the tuning voltage required by the external VCO.\nFractional-N PLL\nThe RFMD2080 contains a charge-pump based fractional-N phase locked loop (PLL) for controlling the three VCOs. The PLL\nincludes automatic calibration systems to counteract the effect s of process and environmental variations, ensuring repeatable\nloop response and phase noise performance. As well as the VCO auto-select and coarse tuning, there is a loop filter calibration\nmechanism which can be enabled if required. This operates by adjusting the charge pump current to maintain loop bandwidth.\nThis can be useful for applications where the LO is tuned over a wide frequency range.\nThe PLL has been designed to use a reference frequency of between 10MHz and 104MHz from an external source, which is\ntypically a temperature controlled crystal oscillator (TCXO). A re ference divider (divide by 1 to divide by 7) is supplied and\nshould be programmed to limit the frequency at the phase detector to a maximum of 52MHz. \nTwo PLL programming banks are provided, the first bank is preceded by the label PLL1 and the second bank is preceded by the\nlabel PLL2. The active register bank is selected by the state of the MODE pin, low for PLL1 and high for PLL2. \nThe VCO outputs are first divided down in a high frequency presca lar. The output of this high frequency prescalar then enters\nthe N divider, which is a fractional divi der containing a dual-modulus prescalar and a digitally spur-compensated fractional\nsequence generator. This allows very fine frequency steps and mi nimizes fractional spurs. The fr actional energy is shaped and\nappears as fractional noise at frequency offsets above 100KHz whic h will be attenuated by the loop filter. An external loop fil ter\nis used, giving flexibility in setting loop bandwidth for optimizing phase noise and lock time, for example.\n6 of 19RFMD2080\nDS1401107628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570 or sales-support@rfmd.com.The synthesizer step size is ty pically 1.5Hz when using a 26MHz reference freque ncy. The exact step size for any reference and\nLO frequency can be calculated using the following formula:\n(FREF * P) / (R * 224 * LO_DIV*2)\nWhere FREF is the reference frequency, R is the reference division rati o, P is the prescalar division ratio, and LO_DIV is the LO\ndivider value.\nPin 26 (GPO4) can be configured as a lock detect pin. The lock status is also available in the read-back register. The lock det ect\nfunction is a window detector on the VCO tuning voltage. The lock flag will be high to show PLL lock which corresponds to the\nVCO tuning voltage being within the specified range, typically 0.30V to 1.25V. \nThe lock time of the PLL will depend on a number of factors;  including the loop bandwidth and the reference frequency at the\nphase detector. This clock frequency determ ines the speed at which the state machin e and internal calibrations run. A 52MHz\nphase detector frequency will give fastest lock times, of typically <50 \uf06dsecs when using the PLL re-lock bit.\nPhase Detector and Charge Pump\nThe phase detector provides a current output to drive an active loop filter. The charge pump output current is set by the value\ncontained in the P1_CP_DEF and P2_CP_DEF fields in the loop filter configuration register. The charge pump current is givenby approximately 3 \uf06dA/bit, and the fields are 6 bits long . This gives default value (31) of 93 \uf06dA and maximum value (63) of\n189\uf06dA.\nIf the automatic loop bandwidth calibration is enabled the char ge pump current is set by the calibration algorithm based upon\nthe VCO gain. \nThe phase detector will operate with a maximum input frequency of 52MHz.\nLoop Filter\nThe active loop filter is implemented using the on-chip low noise op-amp, with external resistors and capacitors. The op-amp\ngives a tuning voltage range of typically +0. 1V to +2.4V. The internal configuration of  the chip is shown below with the recom-\nmended active loop filter. The loop filter shown is designed to give lowest integrat ed phase noise, for reference frequencies o f\nbetween 26MHz and 52MHz. The external loop filter components gi ve the flexibility to optimize the loop response for any par-\nticular application and combination of reference and VCO frequencies.\nLFILT18p2\n180p22K\n470R 470R\n330p 330pLFILT2\nLFILT3\n+1.1V\n7 of 19RFMD2080\nDS1401107628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570 or sales-support@rfmd.com.External Reference\nThe RFMD2080 has been designed to use an external reference such as a TCXO. The typical input will be a 0.8Vp-p clipped\nsine wave, which should be AC-coupled into the reference input. When the PLL is not in use, it may be desirable to turn off theinternal reference circuits, by setting the REFSTBY bit low, to minimize current draw while in standby mode. \nOn cold start, or if REFSTBY is programmed low, the TCXO will need a warm-up period. This is set by the SU_WAIT bits. This will\nallow the clock to be stable and immediately available when the ENBL bit is asserted high, allowing the PLL to assume normal\noperation. \nIf the current consumption of the reference circuits in standby mode, typically 2mA, is not critical, then the REFSTBY bit can be\nset high. This allows the fastest startup and lock time after ENBL is taken high.\nIQ Modulator\nThe IQ modulator core of the RFMD2080 is wideband covering  from 45MHz to 2700MHz. It has been designed to achieve\nexceptional linearity for the amount of DC power consumed.\nThe modulator mixer cores have four coarse  gain/current settings. Each setting steps the gain and linearity by 6dB and can be\nused to optimize performance or reduce power consumption. The best linearity is achieved using the modulator bias settingMODDC=4. This setting adjusts bias mixer current and can be  used to trade off linearity and current consumption. \nThe modulator output is differential and requires a balun and si mple matching circuit optimized to the specific application fre -\nquencies. The modulator output pins are also used to source current for the modulator mixer circuits, about 10mA on each pin.\nThis is usually via a center-tapped balun or  by RF chokes in the external matching circuitry to the supply. The modulator outpu t\nis high impedance, consisting of approximately 2K \uf057 res ist a nc e  in  p ara ll el w it h so m e c ap a c it a nc e , a p p r o xi ma t el y 1 p F .  The\nmodulator output does not require a conjugate matching network. It is a constant current output which will drive a real differ-\nential load of typically 200 \uf057. Since the mixer output is a constant current source, a higher resistance load will give higher out-\nput power and gain. A shunt inductor can be used to resonate wi th the mixer output capacitance at the frequency of interest.\nThis inductor may not be required at lower frequencies where th e impedance of the output capacitance is less significant. At\nhigher output frequencies the inductance of the bond wi res (about 0.5nH on each pin) becomes more significant.\nThe following diagram is a simple  model of the modulator output:\nIt is recommended to use a 4:1 balun on the modulator output, presenting 200 \uf057 to the output in a single ended 50 \uf057 system.\nThe RFMD2080 evaluation board has an RFXF8553 wideband transmission line transformer.\nBaseband Section\nThe RFMD2080 features a baseband se ction that consists of an active low pass filter, variable attenuator and DC offset con-\ntrol circuitry. DC offset calibration is performed using digital- to-analog converters (DACs) that apply an offset voltage to va rious\nparts of the circuit to compensate for DC offsets introduced by the internal buffers and the mixer core. This can be done to op ti-\nmize LO suppression by setting register s to program the DAC offset voltages.0.5nH0.5nH\n1K\uf057\n1pF\n1K\uf057RFMD2080 \nRF Output\n8 of 19RFMD2080\nDS1401107628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570 or sales-support@rfmd.com.The differential I and Q input impedance is set by 10K \uf057 pull down resistors on ea ch pin, so presenting 20K \uf057 differential\nimpedance. The baseband input signals will be typically 1Vp-p differential. A common mode DC voltage between 0.5V and 1.5V\nis req uired f or optimal perf ormance. If req uired the phase and am plitude of either of the I or Q signal can be adjust ed t oreduce the level of the unwanted sideband signal at the modulator output.   \nThe baseband path consists of an active low pass filter with variable capacitors. The variable capacitors provide 64 "rctune"\nsettings that allow the input 3dB bandwidth to be tuned from 1.5MHz to 10MHz. This is followed by a variable gain attenuator\nthat delivers 0dB to -20dB gain in 2dB st eps. Additionally, the mixers have gain co ntrol, ranging from 0dB to -18dB in 6dB\nsteps giving a maximum range of 38dB. The variable gain attenuator and mixer input have DACs attached to allow DC offsets\nwithin the baseband path to be corrected, thus reducing LO breakthrough. An isolat ion switch sits betw een the variable gain\nattenuator and the mixer input to allow their offsets to be compensated separately. This may be required since the offset withi n\nthe variable gain attenuator will vary with gain and thus its DC compensation may also have to vary for optimum LO cancella-\ntion. \nSerial Interface\nAll on-chip registers in the RFMD2080 are programmed using a pr oprietary 3-wire serial bus which supports both write and\nread operations. Synthesizer programming, device configuration and control are achieved through a mixture of hardware and\nsoftware controls. Hardware pins can be used to control ENBL ,  MODE and RESETX or the device can be programmed entirely\nvia the serial bus. \nThe serial data interface can be configured  for 4-wire operation, by setting the \'4WI RE\' bit in the SDI_CTRL register high. The n\npin 26 is used as the data out pin, and pin 32 is the serial data in pin. bb_attenDAC DACdcdac_ai dcdac_i\nI_p\nI_n\ncal_blank\nrc_tunebb_attenDAC DACdcdac_aq dcdac_q\nQ_p\nQ_n\ncal_blankI\nQrc_tunerc_tune\nrc_tune10K\uf057 10K \uf057 \n10K\uf057 10K \uf057 \n9 of 19RFMD2080\nDS1401107628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570 or sales-support@rfmd.com.Hardware Control\nThree hardware control pins are provided: ENBL, MODE, and RESETX.\nThe ENBL pin has two functions: to enable the analog circuits in the chip and to trigger the VCO auto-selection and coarse tun-\ning mechanisms. The VCO auto-selection and coarse tuning are initiated when the ENBL pin is taken high. Every time the fre-quency of the synthesizer is repr ogrammed, ENBL has to be asserted high to initiate these mechanisms and then to initiate the\nPLL locking. Alternatively following the programming of a new frequency the PLL re-lock self clearing bit could be used.\nIf the device is left in the enabled state for long periods, it is recommended that VCO auto-selection and coarse tuning (band\nselection) is performed for every 30°C change in temperature. Th e lock detect flag can be used to indicate when to perform\nthe VCO calibration; it shows that the VCO tuning volt age has drifted significantly with changing temperature.\nThe RESETX pin is a hardware reset control that will reset all di gital circuits to their startup state when asserted low. The d evice\nincludes a power-on-reset function, so this pin should not normal ly be required, in which case it should be connected to the\npositive supply.\nThe MODE pin controls which PLL programming register bank is active.\nSerial Data Interface Control\nThe normal mode of operation uses the 3-wire serial data inte rface to program the device registers, and three extra hardware\ncontrol lines; MODE, ENBL and RESETX. \nWhen the device is under software control, achieved by setting  the SIPIN bit in the SDI_CTRL register high, then the hardware\ncan be controlled via the SDI_CTRL  register. When this is the case, the MODE and ENBL control lines are not required. If the\ndevice is under software control, pins 1 and 9 can be configured as general purpose outputs (GPO).\nMulti-Slice Mode\nThe Multi-Slice mode of operation allows up to four chips to be controlled from a common serial bus. The device address pins,\n(15 and 16) ADD1 and ADD2, are used to set the address of each part.\nOn power up, and after a Reset, the devices ignore the address pins ADD1 and ADD2 and any data  presented to the serial bus\nwill be programmed into all the devices. However, once the \'ADDR\' bit in the SDI_CTRL register is set each device then adopts\nan address according to the state of the address pins on the device.\nGeneral Purpose Outputs\nThe general purpose outputs (GPOs) can be controlled via the GPO register, and will depend on the state of MODE since they\ncan be set in different states corresponding to either path 1 or 2. The GPOs can be used for example to drive LEDs, or to con-trol external circuitry such as  switches or low power LNAs.
