Its programmability and wideband capability \nmake it ideal for a broad range of transceiver applications.  \nThe device combines an RF front end with a flexible mixed-signal \nbaseband section and integrated frequency synthesizers, simpli-fying design-in by providing a configurable digital interface to a processor. The AD9364  operates in the 70 MHz to 6.0 GHz range, \ncovering most licensed and unlicensed bands. Channel bandwidths from less than 200 kHz to 56 MHz are supported. \nThe direct conversion receiver has state-of-the-art noise figure \nand linearity. The receive (Rx) subsystem includes independent automatic gain control (AGC), dc offset correction, quadrature correction, and digital filtering, thereby eliminating the need for these functions in the digital baseband. The AD9364 also has \nflexible manual gain modes that can be externally controlled. \nTwo high dynamic range ADCs digitize the received I and Q \nsignals and pass them through configurable decimation filters and 128-tap FIR filters to produce a 12-bit output signal at the appropriate sample rate. \nThe transmitter uses a direct conversion architecture that achieves \nhigh modulation accuracy with ultralow noise. This transmitter \ndesign produces a Tx EVM of ≤−40 dB, allowing significant system margin for the external power amplifier (PA) selection. The on-board transmit (Tx) power monitor can be used as a power \ndetector, enabling highly accurate Tx power measurements.  \nThe fully integrated phase-locked loops (PLLs) provide low \npower fractional-N frequency synthesis for all Rx and Tx channels. All VCO and loop filter components are integrated. \nThe core of the AD9364 can be powered directly from a 1.3 V \nregulator. The IC is controlled via a standard 4-wire serial port and \nfour real-time input control pins. Comprehensive power-down modes are included to minimize power consumption during normal use. The AD9364 is packaged in a 10 mm × 10 mm, \n144-ball chip scale package ball grid array (CSP_BGA).  \n AD9364 RXB_P,\nRXB_N\nP1_[D11:D0]/\nRX_[D5:D0]P0_[D11:D0]/\nTX_[D5:D0]\nRADIO\nSWITCHINGRXA_P,\nRXA_N\nRXC_P,\nRXC_N\nTX_MON\nDATA INTERFACERx LO\nTx LO\nTXA_P,\nTXA_N\nTXB_P,\nTXB_N\nCTRL\nAUXDACx XTALN AUXADCCTRLSPI\nDACGPO\nPLLsDACADC\nCLK_OUTDACADC\n11846-001NOTES\n1.

C | Page 27 of 32 \nAD9364  Data Sheet  \n \nTHEORY OF OPERATION \nGENERAL  \nThe AD9364 is a highly integrated radio frequency (RF) \ntransceiver cap able of being configured for a wide range of \napplications . The device integrates all RF, mixed signal, and \ndigital blocks necessary to provide all transceiver functions in a \nsingle de vice. Programmability allows this broadband transceiver  \nto be adapted for use with multiple communication standards, including frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) systems. This p rogrammability also allows the \ndevice to be interfaced to various baseband processors (BBPs) using  \na single 12- bit parallel data port, dual 12- bit parallel data ports, \nor a 12 -bit low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) interface. \nThe AD9364 also provides self  calibration  and automatic gain \ncontrol (AGC) systems to maintain a high performance level under varying temperatures and input signal conditions. In  addi -\ntion, the device includes several test modes that allow system designers t o insert test tones and create internal loopback modes  \nthat can be used by designers to debug their designs during prototyping and optimize their radio configuration for a  \nspecific application.  \nRECEI VER  \nThe receiver section contains all blocks necessary to receive RF signals and convert them to digital data that is usable by a BBP . \nIt has three inputs that can be multiplexed to the signal chain, \nmaking the AD9364 suitable for use in multiband systems with \nmultiple antenna inputs.  The receiver is a direct conversion \nsystem that contains a low noise amplifier (LNA), followed by matched in -phase (I) and quadrature (Q) amplifiers, mixers, \nand band  shaping filters that downconvert received signals to \nbaseband for digitization. External LNAs can also be interfaced to the device, allowing designers the flexibility to customize the receiver front end for their specific application.  \nGain control is achieved by following a preprogrammed gain index map that distributes gain among the blocks for optim al \nperformance at each level.  This can be achieved by enabling the \ninternal AGC in either fast or slow mode  or by using manual \ngain control, allowing the BBP t o make the gain adjustments as \nneeded.  Additionally, each channel contains independent RSSI \nmeasurement capability, dc  offset tracking, and all circuitry \nnecessary for self calibration .  \nThe receiver includes 12-bit, Σ-Δ ADCs and adjustable sample \nrates that produce data streams from the received signals. The \ndigitized signals can be conditioned further by a series of \ndecimation filters and a fully programmable  128-tap FIR filter \nwith  additional decimation settings. The sample rate of each \ndigital filter block is adjustable  by changing decimation factors \nto produce the desired output data rate.  \n TRANSMITTER  \nThe transmitter section consists of two differential output stages \nthat can be multiplexed to the transmit channel. The transmit \nchannel provides  all d igital processing, mixed signal, and RF \nblocks necessary to implement a direct conversion  system. The \ndigital data received from the BBP passe s through a fully \nprogrammable 128 -tap FIR filter with interpolation  options. The \nFIR output is sent  to a series o f interpolation filters that provide \nadditional filtering and data rate interpolation prior to reaching  the \nDAC. Each 12 -bit DAC has an adjustable sampling rate. Both \nthe I and Q channels are fed to the RF block for upconversion.  \nWhen  converted to baseband  analog signals, the I and Q signals \nare filtered to remove sampling artifacts and fed to the upcon -\nversion mixers. At this point, the I and Q signals are recombined  \nand modulated on the carrier frequency for transmission to the \noutput stage. The combined signal  also pass es through analog \nfilters that provide additional band shaping , and then the signal \nis transmitted  to the output amplifier. The  transmit channel \nprovid es a wide attenuation adjustment range with fine granularity  \nto help designers optimize signal -to-noise ratio (SNR).  \nSelf calibration circuitry is built into each transmit channel to \nprovide automatic real -time adjustment. The transmitter block \nalso provides a T x monitor block. This block monitors the \ntransmitter o utput and routes it back through the receiver \nchannel to the BBP for signal monitoring. The T x monitor \nblock  is available only in TDD mode operation while the \nreceiver is idle.  \nCLOCK INPUT OPTIONS  \nThe AD9364 operates  using a reference clock that can be provided  \nby two different sources.  The first option is to use a  dedicated \ncryst al with a frequency between 19 MHz and 50  MHz connected  \nbetween the XTALP and XTAL N pins.  The second option is to \nconnec t an external oscillator or clock distribution devic e (such as  \nthe AD9548 ) to the XTALN pin (with the XTAL P pin remaining  \nunconnected).  If an external oscillator is used, the frequency \ncan vary between 1 0 MHz and 80 MHz.  This reference clock is \nused to supply the synthesizer blocks that generate all data clocks, sample clocks, and local oscillators inside the device.  \nErrors in the crystal frequency can be removed by using the digitally programmab le digitally controlled crystal oscillator \n(DCXO ) function to adjust an on- chip variable capacitor. This \ncapacitor can tune the crystal frequency variance out of the system, resulting in a more accurate reference clock from which all other frequency signal s are generated. This function can also \nbe used with on -chip temperature sensing to provide oscillator \nfrequency temperature compensation during normal operation.  \n \n \n \nRev. C | Page 28 of 32 \nData Sheet  AD9364  \n \nSYNTHESIZERS  \nRF PLLs  \nThe AD9364  contains two identical synthesizers to generate the \nrequired L O signals  for the RF signal paths —one for the receiver \nand one fo r the transmitter. P hase-locked loop (PLL) synthesizers \nare fractional -N designs incorporating  completely integrated \nvoltage co ntrolled oscillators (VCOs) and loop filters. In TDD \nmode , the synthesizers turn on and off as appropriate  for the Rx \nand Tx frames. In FDD mode, the Tx  PLL and the Rx PLL can \nbe activated at the same time. These PLLs require no external \ncomponents.  \nBB PLL \nThe AD9364 also contains a baseband PLL (BB PLL) \nsynthesizer that is used to  generate all baseband related clock \nsignals. These include  the ADC and DAC sampling clocks, the \nDATA_CLK signal (see the Digital Data Interface  section), and \nall data framing signals. This PLL is programmed from  700 MHz \nto 1400  MHz  based on the data rate and sample rate requirements \nof the system.  \nDIGITAL DATA INTERFACE  \nThe AD9364 data interface uses parallel data ports (P0 and P1) \nto transfer data between the device and the BBP .  The data ports can  \nbe configured  in either single -ended CMOS format or differential \nLVDS format.  Both formats can be configured in multiple arrange -\nments  to match system requirements for data ordering and  data \nport connections.  These arrangements include single port data \nbus, dual port d ata bus, single data rate, and double data rate.  \nBus transfers are controlled using simple hardware handshake signaling. The two por ts can be operated in either bi directional \n(half -duplex ) mode or in full duplex  mode where half the bits \nare used for transm itting data and half are used for receiving data . \nThe interface can also be configured to use only one of the data ports for applications that do not  require high data rates and \nprefer to use fewer interface pins.   \nDATA_CLK Signal \nThe AD9364 supplies the DATA_CLK  signal that the BBP use s \nwhen receiving the data.  The DATA_CLK  signal can be set to a \nrate that provides single data rate  (SDR) timing where data is \nsampled o n each rising clock edge , or it can be set to provide \ndouble data r ate (DDR) timing where data is captured  on both \nrising and falling edges. SDR or DDR  timing applies to \noperation using either a single port or both ports.   \nFB_CLK Signal  \nFor transmit data, the interface uses the FB_CLK signal as the \ntiming reference.  FB_CLK allows source  synchronous timing \nwith rising edge capture for burst control signals and either rising edge (SDR mode) or both edge capture (DDR mode) for transmit signal bursts. The FB_CLK signa l must have the same \nfrequency and duty cycle as DATA_CLK.  RX_FRAME Signal  \nThe device generates an RX_FRAME output signal whenever the \nreceiver outputs valid data.  This signal has two modes: level \nmode (RX_FRAME stays high as long as the data is valid) and \npulse mo de (RX_FRAME  pulses with a 50% duty cycle). Similarly,  \nthe BBP must provide a TX_FRAME signal that indicates the beginning of a valid data transmission with a rising edge.  Similar  \nto the RX_FRAME  signal , the TX_FRAME  signal can  remain  \nhigh throughout the burst  or it can be pulsed with a 50% duty \ncycle.  \nENABLE STATE MACHINE  \nThe AD9364 transceiver includes an enable state ma chine (ENSM) \nthat allows real -time control over the cur rent state of the device.  \nThe device ca n be placed in several different states dur ing normal  \noperation, including  \n• Wait —power save, synthesizers disabled  \n• Sleep—wait with all clocks/BB  PLL disabled  \n• Tx—Tx signal chain enabled  \n• Rx—Rx signal chain enabled  \n• FDD —Tx and Rx signal chains enabled  \n• Alert —synthesizers enabled  \nThe ENSM has two possible control methods: SPI control and \npin control.   \nSPI Control Mode  \nIn SPI control mode, the ENSM is controlled asynchronously by writing SPI registers to advance the current state to the next state.  SPI control is considered asynchronous to the DATA_CLK \nbecause the SPI_CLK can be derived from a different  clock \nreference and can still function properly.  The SPI control ENSM  \nmethod is recommended when real -time control of the \nsynthesizers is not necessary. SPI control can be used for real -\ntime control as long as the BBP  has the ability to perform timed  \nSPI writes  accurately .  \nPin Control Mode  \nIn pin control  mode , the enable function of the ENABLE  pin and \nthe TXNRX pin  allow rea l-time control of the current state.  The \nENSM allows TDD or FDD operation depending on the configuration of the corresponding SPI register.  The ENABLE  \nand TXNRX pin control method is recommended if the BB P \nhas extra control outputs that can be controlled i n real time, \nallowing a simple 2 -wire interface to control the state of the \ndevice.  To advance the current state of the ENSM to the next  \nstate, the enable function of the ENABLE pin can be driven  by \neither a pulse (edge detected internally) or a level.   \nWhen  a pulse is used, it must have a minimum pulse width of \none FB_CLK  cycle . In level mode, the ENABLE and TXNRX \npins are also edge detected by the AD9364 and must meet the \nsame minimum  pulse wid th requirement of one FB_CLK cycle.   \nIn FDD mode, the ENABLE and TXNRX pins can be remapped to  \nserve as real -time Rx and Tx data transfer control signals. In this \nmode, the enable function of the ENABLE pin assumes the RXON  \nRev. C | Page 29 of 32 \nAD9364  Data Sheet  \n \nfunction (control ling when the Rx path is enabled and  disabled), \nand the TXNRX pin assumes the  TXON  function  (controlling  \nwhen the Tx  path is enabled and  disabled ). In this mode, the \nENSM is removed from the system for control of  all data flow \nby these pins.  \nSPI INTERFACE  \nThe AD9364 uses a serial peripheral inte rface (SPI) to communi -\ncate with the BBP .  The SPI can be configured as a 4 -wire \ninterface with dedicated receive and transmit ports, or it can \nbe configured as a 3 -wire interface with a bidirection al data \ncommunication port.  This bus allows the BBP to set all device \ncontrol parameters using a simple address data serial bus \nprotocol.   \nWrite commands follow a 24 -bit format.  The first six bits are \nused to set the bus direction and number of bytes to transfer.  \nThe next 10 bits set the address where data is to be  written.   \nThe final eight bits are the data to be transferred to the specifie d \nregister address (MSB to LSB).  The AD9364 also supports an \nLSB-first format that allows the commands to be written in LSB  \nto MSB format.  In this mode, the register addr esses are incre -\nmented for multi byte writes.  \nRead commands follow a similar format  with the  except ion that \nthe first 16 bits are transferred on the SPI_DI pin and the final \neight bits are read from the AD9364, either on the SPI_DO pin \nin 4-wire mode or on the SPI_DI pin in 3 -wire mode.   \nCONTROL PINS  \nCont rol Outputs (CTRL_OUT7  to CTRL_OUT0)  \nThe AD9364 provides eight simultaneous real -time output signals  \nfor use as interrupts to the BBP . These outputs can be configured  to \noutput a number of internal settings and mea surements that the \nBBP can use when monitoring transceiver performance in different situations.  The control output pointer register selects what \ninformation is output to these pins, and the  control output ena ble \nregister determines which signals are activated  for monitoring by \nthe BBP .  Signals used for manual gain mode, calibration flags, \nstate machine states, and the ADC output are among the outputs  \nthat can be monitored  on these pins.   \nControl Inputs (CTRL_I N3 to CTRL_IN 0) \nThe AD9364 provides four edge  detected  control input pins . In \nmanual gain mode, the BBP can use these pins to change the gain table index in real time.  In transmit mode, the BBP ca n use two \nof the pins to change the transmit gain in real time.  \nGPO PINS (GPO _3 TO GPO_0 ) \nThe AD9364 provides four , 3.3 V capable  general -purpose  logic \noutput pins: GPO_3, GPO_2, GPO_1, and GPO_0. These pins \ncan be used to control other peripheral devices such as regulators  \nand switches via the AD9364 SPI bus , or they can function as  \nslave s for the internal AD9364 state machine.  AUXILIARY CONVERTERS  \nAUXADC  \nThe AD9364 contains  an auxiliary ADC that can be used to mon -\nitor s ystem functions such as temperature or power output.  The \nconverter is 12 bits wide and has an input range of 0.05 V to \nVDDA1P3_BB − 0.05 V . When enabled, the ADC is free running.  \nSPI reads provide  the last value latched at the ADC output.  A \nmultiplexer in front of the  ADC allows the user to select between \nthe AUXADC input  pin and a built -in temperature sensor.  \nAUXDAC1 and AUXDAC2  \nThe AD9364 contains two identical auxiliary DACs that can \nprovide pow er amplifier (PA) bias or other system functionality.  \nThe auxiliary DACs are 10 bits wide, have an ou tput voltage range  \nof 0.5 V to VDD_GPO  − 0.3 V, a current drive of 10  mA, and \ncan be directly controlled by the internal enable state machine.  \nPOWERING THE  AD9364  \nThe AD9364 must be powered by the following three supplies: \nthe analog supply ( VDDD1P3_DIG/VDDAx = 1.3 V), the  \ninterface supply (VDD_INTERFACE = 1.8 V), and the GPO \nsupply (VDD_GPO = 3.3 V).  \nFor applications requiring optimal noise performance, it is \nrecommended that the 1.3 V analog supply be split and sourced \nfrom low noise, low dropout (LDO) regulators. Figure 74 shows \nthe recommended method.   \n \nFigure 74. Low Noise Power Solution for the AD9364  \nFor applications where board space is at a premium, and optimal noise performance is not an absolute requirement, the 1.3 V analog rail can be provided directly from a switcher , and a \nmore integrated power management unit ( PMU ) approach can \nbe adopt ed. Figure 75 shows this approach.  \n \nFigure 75.
