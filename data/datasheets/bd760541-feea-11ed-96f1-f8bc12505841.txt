The \ndevice can be connected directly to a microprocessor, \neliminating the need for A/D converters or timing resources. It can measure magnetic fields within the \nfull scale range of \uf0b18Gauss (G), with 0.25mG per LSB \nresolution at 16bits operation mode and 0.4mG total RMS noise level, enablin g heading accuracy of \uf0b11º in \nelectronic compass applications. Contact MEMSIC for \naccess to advanced calibration and tilt-compensation \nalgorithms. \nAn integrated SET/RESET function provides for the \nelimination of error due to Null Field output change \nwith temperature. Temperature information from the integrated temperature sensor is available over the \nI\n2C Interface. The SET/RESET function can be \nperformed for each measurement, periodically, or when the temperature changes by a predetermined \namount as the specific application requires. \nIn addition, the SET/RESET function clears the \nsensors of any residual magnetic polarization resulting \nfrom exposure to strong external magnets. \nThe MMC5883MA is packaged in a low profile LGA \npackage (3.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 mm) and an operating \ntemperature range from -40 \uf0b0C to +85 \uf0b0C. \nThe MMC5883MA provides an I\n2C digital output with \n400 KHz, fast mode operation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInformation furnished by MEMSIC is believed to be accurate and reliable.  \nHowever, no responsibility is assumed by MEMSIC for its use, or for any \ninfringements of patents or other rights of third parties which may result from \nits use.

During manufacturing, a \nstrong magnetic field is applie d to the film to orient its \nmagnetic domains in the same direction, establishing a magnetization vector. Subsequently, an external \nmagnetic field applied perpendicularly to the sides of \nthe film causes the magnetization to rotate and \nchange angle. This effect causes the film’s resistance \nto vary with the intensity of the applied magnetic field. The MEMSIC AMR sensor is incorporated into a \nWheatstone bridge configuration to maximize signal to Noise ratio. A change in magnetic field produces a \nproportional change in differential voltage across the \nWheatstone bridge. \nHowever, the influence of a strong magnetic field \n(more than 10 G) in any direction could upset, or flip, the polarity of the film, thus changing the sensor \ncharacteristics. A strong restoring magnetic field must \nbe applied momentarily to restore, or set, the sensor \ncharacteristics. The MEMSIC magnetic sensor has an \non-chip magnetically coupled strap: a SET/RESET \nstrap pulsed with a high current, to provide the restoring magnetic field. \nEXTERNAL CIRCUITRY CONNECTION \nThe MMC5883MA was designed for flexible power \nconnections to support existing and new designs. It \ncan operate from a single 2.16V to 3.6V supply or \nfrom dual supplies using a 2.16V to 3.6V VDD supply and a 1.62V to 3.6V VDDIO supply. The circuit \nconnection diagrams belo w illustrate power supply \nconnection options. \n<Top View> \nDual Supply Connection<Top View> \nSingle Supply Connection \nPIN DESCRIPTIONS \nCAP – This is the supply input for SET/RESET coil. \nMEMSIC recommends a minimum 10 uF low ESR \ncapacitor be placed in close proximity to the VCAP \npin. \nGND – This is the ground pin for the magnetic sensor. \nSDA – This pin is the I2C serial data line, and \noperates in FAST (400 KHz) mode .  \nSCL – This pin is the I2C serial clock line, and \noperates in FAST (400 KHz) mode. \nVDD –This pin is the power supply of the ASIC.  \nVDDIO –This pin is the power supply of the digital \ninterface of the ASIC.  \nINT – Interrupt output. High effective. This pin is held \nas hi-Z until an interrupt function is enabled. \n  \n\n \nMEMSIC MMC5883MA Rev.C Page 6 of 15 Formal release date: 4/28/2017 HARDWARE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS \n\uf0fc Provide adequate separation distance to devices \nthat contain permanent magnets or generate magnetic fields (e.g. speakers, coils, \ninductors).The combined magnetic field to be \nmeasured and interference magnetic field should be less than the full scale range of the \nMMC5883MA.  \n\uf0fc Provide adequate separation distance to current \ncarrying traces. Do not route current carrying \ntraces under the sensor or on the other side of the \nPCB opposite to the device. \n\uf0fc Do not cover the sensor with magnetized material   \nor materials that may become magnetized, (e.g., \nshield box, LCD, battery, iron bearing materials). \n\uf0fc Do not place the device opposite to magnetized \nmaterial or materials that may become \nmagnetized located on the other side of the PCB.  \nPlease refer to MEMSIC magnetic sensor layout \nguideline. \nPOWER CONSUMPTION \nThe power consumed by the device is proportional to \nthe number of measurements taken per second. For example, when BW<1:0>=00, that is, 16-bit mode with \n10ms per measurement, MMC5883MA consumes 120 \nµA (typical) at 1.8 V with 7 measurements per second. \nIf only 2 measurements are performed per second, the \ncurrent will be 120*2/7=34µA. \nI\n2C INTERFACE DESCRIPTION \nA slave mode I2C circuit has been implemented into \nthe MEMSIC magnetic sensor as a standard interface \nfor customer applications. The A/D converter \nfunctionality has been added to the MEMSIC sensor, thereby increasing ease-of-use, and lowering power \nconsumption, footprint and total solution cost. \nThe I\n2C (or Inter IC bus) is an industry standard bi-\ndirectional two-wire interface bus. A master I2C device \ncan operate READ/WRITE  and controls up to 128 \ndevices by device addressing. The MEMSIC magnetic \nsensor operates only in a slave mode, i.e. only responding to calls to its address by a Master device.  I2C BUS CHARACTERISTICS \n \nThe two wires in the I2C bus are called SDA (serial \ndata line) and SCL (serial clock line). In order for a \ndata transfer to start, the bus has to be free, which is \ndefined by both wires in a HIGH output state. Due to \nthe open-drain / pull-up resistor structure and wired \nBoolean “AND” operation, any device on the bus can pull lines low and overwrite a HIGH signal. The data \non the SDA line has to be stable during the HIGH period of the SCL line. In other words, valid data can \nonly change when the SCL line is LOW. \nNote:  Rp selection guide: 4.7k ohm for a short I\n2C \nbus length (less than 10 cm), and 10k ohm for a bus \nlength less than 5 cm.  \n Rp Rp \nSDA(Serial Data Line) \nSCL (Serial Clock \nLine) \n \n \nDEVICE 1  \n \nDEVICE 2 VDD \n \nMEMSIC MMC5883MA Rev.C Page 7 of 15 Formal release date: 4/28/2017 REGISTER MAP \nRegister Name Address Description \nXout Low 00H Xout LSB \nXout High 01H Xout MSB \nYout Low 02H Yout LSB \nYout High 03H Yout MSB \nZout Low 04H Zout LSB \nZout High 05H Zout MSB \nTemperature 06H Temperature output \nStatus 07H Device status \nInternal control 0 08H Control register 0 \nInternal control 1 09H Control register 1 \nInternal control 2 0AH Control register 2 \nX Threshold 0BH Motion detection threshold of X \nY Threshold 0CH Motion detection threshold of Y \nZ Threshold 0DH Motion detection threshold of Z \nProduct ID 1 2FH Product ID \nREGISTER DETAILS \nXout High, Xout Low \nXout Low 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nAddr: 00H Xout[7:0] \nMode R \n \nXout High 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nAddr: 01H Xout[15:8] \nMode R \nX-axis output, unsigned format. \nYout High, Yout Low \nYout Low 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nAddr: 02H Yout[7:0] \nMode R \n \nYout High 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nAddr: 03H Yout[15:8] \nMode R \nY-axis output, unsigned format. \nZout High, Zout Low \nZout Low 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nAddr: 04H Zout[7:0] \nMode R \n \nZout High 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nAddr: 05H Zout[15:8] \nMode R \nZ-axis output, unsigned format. \nTemperature Out \nTemperature 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nAddr: 06H Tout[7:0] \nMode R \nTemperature output, unsigned format.

A “START” \ncondition is defined by a HIGH to LOW transition on the SDA line while SCL line is HIGH. A “STOP” \ncondition is defined by a LOW to HIGH transition on \nthe SDA line while the SCL line is held HIGH. All data transfer in I\n2C system are 8-bits long. Each byte has \nto be followed by an acknowledge bit. Each data transfer involves a total of 9 clock cycles. Data is \ntransferred starting with the most significant bit (MSB).  \nAfter a START condition, the Master device calls a \nspecific slave device by sending its 7-bit address with \nthe 8\nth bit (LSB) indicating that either a READ or \nWRITE operation will follow, [1] for READ and [0] for \nWRITE.  The MEMSIC device 7-bit device address is [0110000] . \nThe initial addressing of the slave is always followed \nby the master writing the number of the slave register \nto be read or written, so this initial addressing always \nindicates a WRITE operation by sending [01100000] .  \nAfter being addressed, the MEMSIC device being called should respond by an “Acknowledge” signal by \npulling SDA line LOW.  Subsequent communication bytes can either be \na) The data to be written to the device register, or \nb) Another START condition followed by the device \naddress indicating a READ operation [01100001] , \nand then the master reads the register data. \nMultiple data bytes can be written or read to \nnumerically sequential registers without the need of \nanother START condition.  Data transfer is terminated \nby a STOP condition or another START condition.   Two detailed examples of communicating with the \nMEMSIC device are listed below for the actions of \nacquiring a magnetic field measurement and magnetizing the sensor.  \nEXAMPLE MEASUREMENT \n1\nst cycle : A START condition is established by the \nMaster device followed by a call to the slave address \n[0110000] with the eighth bit held low to indicate a WRITE request.  \n2\nnd cycle : After an acknowledge signal is received by \nthe Master device (MEMSIC device pulls SDA line low during 9\nth SCL pulse), the Master device sends the \naddress of Control Register 0 or [00001000] as the target register to be written. The MEMSIC device \nshould acknowledge receipt of the address (9\nth SCL \npulse, SDA pulled low).  \n3rdcycle : The Master device writes to the Internal \nControl Register 0 the code [00000001] (TM_M high) to initiate data acquisition. The MEMSIC device \nshould send an Acknowledge and internally initiate a measurement (collect x, y and z data). A STOP \ncondition indicates the end of the write operation. 4\nthcycle : The Master device sends a START \ncommand followed by the MEMSIC device’s seven bit \naddress, and finally the eighth bit set low to indicate a \nWRITE. An Acknowledge should be send by the \nMEMSIC device in response. \n5thcycle : The Master device sends the MEMSIC \ndevice’s Status Register [00000111] as the address to read.  \n6\nthcycle : The Master device sends a START \ncommand followed by the MEMSIC device’s seven bit \naddress, and finally the eighth bit set high to indicate a  \nREAD. An Acknowledge should be send by the \nMEMSIC device in response. \n7th cycle : The Master device cycles the SCL line. This \ncauses the Status Register data to appear on SDA \nline. Continuously read the Status Register until the Meas_M_Done bit (bit 0) is set to ‘1’.or check INT pin \nstatus. This indicates that data for the x, y, and z sensors is available to be read. \n8\nthcycle : The Master device sends a START \ncommand followed by the MEMSIC device’s seven bit \naddress, and finally the eighth bit set low to indicate a \nWRITE. An Acknowledge should be send by the \nMEMSIC device in response. \n9thcycle : The Master device sends a [00000000] \n(Xout LSB register address) as the register address to \nread.  \n10thcycle : The Master device calls the MEMSIC \ndevice’s address with a READ (8th SCL cycle SDA line \nhigh). An Acknowledge should be send by the MEMSIC device in response. \n11\nthcycle : Master device continues to cycle the SCL \nline, and each consecutive byte of data from the X, Y \nand Z registers should appear on the SDA line. The internal memory address po inter automatically moves \nto the next byte.  The Master device acknowledges \neach.  Thus: \n12\nthcycle : LSB of X channel. \n13thcycle : MSB of X channel. \n14thcycle : LSB of Y channel. \n15thcycle : MSB of Y channel. \n16thcycle : LSB of Z channel. \n17thcycle : MSB of Z channel. \nMaster ends communications by NOT sending an \n‘Acknowledge’ and also follows with a ‘STOP’ \ncommand.  \n \nMEMSIC MMC5883MA Rev.C Page 12 of 15 Formal release date: 4/28/2017 EXAMPLE OF SET \n1st cycle : A START condition is established by the \nMaster device followed by a call to the slave address \n[0110000] with the eighth bit held low to indicate a WRITE request.  \n2\nnd cycle : After an acknowledge signal is received by \nthe Master device (The MEMSIC device pulls the SDA \nline low during the 9th SCL pulse), the Master device \nsends [00001000] as the target address (Internal Control Register 0).

The SET and RESET \nfunctions effectively alternately flip the magnetic sensing polarity of the sensing elements of the device.  \n1) The most accurate magnetic field measurements \ncan be obtained by using the protocol described \nas follows: Perform SET. This sets the internal \nmagnetization of the sensing resistors in the direction of the SET field. \n2) Perform MEASUREMENT.  This measurement \nwill contain not only the sensors response to the \nexternal magnetic field, H, but also the Offset; in other words,  \nOutput1 = +H + Offset. \n3) Perform RESET. This resets the internal \nmagnetization of the sensing resistors in the \ndirection of the RESET field, which is opposite to the SET field (180\no opposed). \n4) Perform MEASUREMENT.  This measurement \nwill contain both the sensors response to the \nexternal field and also the Offset.  In other words,  \nOutput2 = -H + Offset. \n5) Finally, calculate H by subtracting the two \nmeasurements and dividing by 2. This procedure \neffectively eliminates the Offset from the \nmeasurement and therefore any changes in the \nOffset over temperature. \nNote: To calculate and store the offset; add the two \nmeasurements and divide by 2. This calculated offset \nvalue can be subtracted from subsequent measurements to obtain H directly from each \nmeasurement.  \n  \n \nMEMSIC MMC5883MA Rev.C Page 13 of 15 Formal release date: 4/28/2017  OPERATING TIMING \n \nOperating Timing Diagram \nParameter Symbol Min.
