The required decoupling for V DDH  depends on the power supply network connected to the \nsensor, a capacitor  of 1 \uf06dF is recommended. V DD and V DDH  must be connected to one single supply V DD. The external pull -\nup resistors ( e.g., Rp = 10 k\uf057) are required to pull the SDA and SCL signal  lines high. For dimensioning resistor sizes please \ntake bus capacity and communi cation frequency into account (see section 7.1 of  NXP I2C-bus specification and user  manual  for \nmore details ). It should be noted that pull -up resistors may be included in I/O circuits of microcontrollers. The die pad or center \npad is electrically connected to GND. Hence, electrical considerations do not impose constraints on the wiring of the die pad . \nHowever, for  mechanical stability it is recommended to solder the die pad to the PCB.  \nPin Name  Comments  \n 1 VDD  Supply voltage  \n2 VSS Ground  \n3 SDA Serial data, bidirectional  \n4 n/a Connect to ground (no electrical function)  \n5 VDDH  Supply voltage, hotplate  \n6 SCL Serial clock, bidirectional  \n \nTable 6 Pin assignment (transparent top view).

The Moisture Sensitivity Level \nclassification of the SGP40 is MSL1, according to IPC/JEDEC J -STD-020. At the same time,  it is recommended to further \nprocess the sensors within 1 year after date of delivery.  The SGP40 should not be exposed to  bright illumination by either \nsunlight or artificial light sources during operation . \n2.7 Material Contents  \nThe device is fully RoHS, REAC H, Hal ogen -free, and WEEE compliant, e.g., free of Pb, Cd, and Hg.  \n  \n\n \n  \n \nwww.sensirion.com  version 1.2 – February  2022 9/20 \n  \n3 Sensor Output Signal Description  \n3.1 Raw Signal Measurement  \nCalling the  sgp40_measure_raw _signal  command  launches/continues the VOC measurement mode . It starts one  measurement  \nof the raw signal (SRAW _VOC ) which is returned  after 30  ms. Raw signal value in ticks is provided as one  16-bit word followed \nby one CRC byte  (Figure 6). The raw signal in ticks is proportional to the logarithm of the sensor resistance.  This signal is used \nas input for Sensirion’s Gas Index  Algorithm to provide a processed VOC Index (see section  3.2 VOC Index Measurement ). In \ncase the Gas Index  Algorithm is not used, discard the first measured value.  Typically, a measurement is performed every  second  \nby calling the sgp40_measure_raw _signal  command again  every second  without turning the heater off . To exit the VOC \nmeasurement mode, the master calls the sgp4 x_turn_ heater_off  command  which  switches off the hotplate and puts the sensor \nin idle mode . \n \nFigure 6 Process flow for performing a raw signal measurement with the SGP40. For enabling on -chip humidity \ncompensation, current relative humidity and temperature values have to be supplied as part of the measurement \ncommand.  \nThe SGP40 features an automatic on -chip humidity compensation of the raw signal. The feature remains disabled as long as \ndefault values for both humidity and temperature are sent together with the sgp40_measure_raw _signal  command. For enabling \nthe compensation , the measurement command includ es two words (+ respective CRC bytes) where the first word represents  \nthe relative humidity and the second one represents  the temperature . \n3.2 VOC Index Measurement  \n \nFigure 7 Schematic of the  driver and  Gas Index Algorithm implementation on a microcontroller . \nFor best performance in indoor -air-quality use cases, Sensirion recommends processing the (humidity -compensated) raw signal \nSRAW _VOC  through Sensirion’s powerful Gas Index  Algorithm. This algorithm  (Figure 7) automatically adapts its output to any \nindoor environmen t and maps all VOC events to  a VOC Index scale ranging from 1 to 500  VOC Index points  (Figure 8). The \nvalue 100 refers to the average  indoor gas composition over the past 24  h. While values between 100 and 500 indicate a \ndeterioration , values between 1 and 100 inform  about improvement of the air quality . The Gas Index  Algorithm is available  on \nGitHub (see SGP40 product page on Sensirion’s webpage ). The SGP40 raw signal needs to be provided  to the Gas Index  \nAlgorithm at a sampling rate of 1  s. \n\n \n  \n \nwww.sensirion.com  version 1.2 – February  2022 10/20 \n  \n \nFigure 8 Explanation of the VOC Index  scale . \n3.3 Built -in Self -Test \nWith t he sgp40_ execute _self _test  command , users can perform an on -chip self -test for , e.g., in-line or end -of-line production \ntesting.  If this command is called when the sensor is in idle mode, the sensor returns to idle mode after the test  (Figure 9). In \ncase this command is called during VOC measurem ent mode ( i.e., after calling the sgp40_measure_raw _signal  command), the \nhotplate remains switched on thereafter.  After 320 ms, the master can read a fixed data pattern  (1 word + CRC byte)  to check  if \nthe test was successful or not . \n \nFigure 9 Possible ways of integrating the built -in self -test function.  \n3.4 Reading out The Sensor Serial Number  \nEvery SGP4 0 sensor  carries a unique serial number  for identification purposes which is hard coded during sensor production. \nThis number  can be read out by using the sgp4 x_get_serial _number  command at any time in idle mode ( Figure 10). After 1  ms, \nthe chip responds with 3 words (each word followed  by one CRC byte) which together constitute the serial number . \n \nFigure 10 Process flow for reading out the serial number  of the SGP4 0 sensor . \n3.5 Sensor Start -up Behavior  \nThe sensor starts powering -up after reaching the power -up threshold voltage  of 1.7  V and enters idle mode after  max. 0.6  ms. \nIn this state, the sensor i s ready to receive commands from the master.  \n  \n\n \n  \n \nwww.sensirion.com  version 1.2 – February  2022 11/20 \n  \n4 Digital Interface Description  \n4.1 General Considerations  \nFor detailed information about the I2C protocol itself and its detailed implementation, please, consult the document NXP I2C-bus \nspecification and user manual . All SGP40  commands cons ist of two bytes (16 bits).  The commands must not be followed by a \nCRC . Additionally,  data sent to and  returne d from the sensor is transferred in pack ets of two bytes (16 bits) followed by a 1 -byte \n(8 bit) CRC.  \n4.2 I2C Address  \nThe sensor’s I2C address is 89 (decimal; hex.: 0x59). The I2C header is formed by the I2C address followed by a read or write \nbit. \n4.3 I2C Voltage Levels  \nInput and output voltage levels are specified in section 6.1 of NXP I2C-bus specification and user manual . The sensor’s interface \nis compatible with 1.7 –3.6 V I2C bus voltage levels depending on the supply voltage level.  \n4.4 I2C Protocol Speed  \nThe sensor supports I2C “standard -mode” and “fast -mode”, with a maximum clock frequency of 100 or 400  kHz, respectively . \n4.5 I2C Sequences  \nThe typical communication sequence between the I2C master ( e.g., a microcontroller in a host device) and the sensor is \ndescribed as follows  and visualized in Figure 11: \n1. The sensor is powered up . \n2. The I2C master periodically calls the  measurement  command  and reads data in the following sequence:  \na. I2C master sends a measurement command . \nb. I2C master waits until the measurement  is finished either by waiting for the maximum execution time or by waiting for the \nexpected duration and then poll data until the read header is acknowledged by the sensor (expected durations are listed \nin Table 8). \nc. I2C master reads out the measurement result . \n \nFigure 11 Possible I2C command sequence s for communicating with the SGP40 . Dark areas indicate that the sensor controls the SDA (data) \nline. First, the I2C master sends the write header writing a 16 -bit command, potentially followed by two words of data with CRC bytes. For \nreading the measured data  (from the built -in self -test a nd from the sensor measurement) , the I2C master sends the read header and receives \none word of data with CRC byte.  In case of reading out the serial number  of the sensor , the master receives three word s with CRC bytes.  \nWith the acknowledgement of the meas urement command, the SGP40 starts measuring. When the measurement is in progress, \nno communication with the sensor is possible and the sensor aborts the communication with a NACK condition. After the sensor \nhas completed the measurement, the master can rea d the measurement results by sending an I2C read header. The sensor will \nacknowledge the reception of the read header and responds with data. The response data length is listed in Table 8 and is \nstructured in data words, where one word consists of two bytes of data (most significant bit first) followed by a one-byte CRC \n\n \n  \n \nwww.sensirion.com  version 1.2 – February  2022 12/20 \n  \nchecksum. Each byte must be acknowledged by the master with an ACK condition for the sensor to continu e sending data. If \nthe sensor does not receive an ACK from the master after any byte of data, it will not continue sending data.  \nAfter receiving the checksum for the last word of data, a NACK and STOP condition have to be sent (see Figure 11). The I2C \nmaster can abort the read transfer with a NACK followed by a STOP condition after any data byte if it is not interested in \nsubsequent data, e.g., the CRC byte or following data bytes, in order to save time. Note that the data cannot be read more than \nonce, and access to data beyond the specified amount will return a pattern of high bits.  \n4.6 Checksum Calculation  \nThe 8 -bit CRC checksum transmitted after each data word is generated by the CRC algorithm  according to the properties as \nstated in Table 7.

Pads on PCB are recommended to be non -solder mask \ndefined (NSMD). Recommended solder paste  stencil thickness is 125 –150 \uf06dm. \n \nFigure 14 Recommended land pattern.  \n5.4 Soldering Instructions  \nStandard reflow soldering ovens and “no clean” type 3 solder paste (as specified in IPC J -STD-005A) should  be used for \nsoldering  the SGP40 . The sensors are designed to withstand a soldering profile  according to IPC/JEDEC J -STD-020. Peak \ntemperatures of T P = 245 °C during up to t p = 30 s for Pb -free assembly in IR/Convection reflow ovens (see Figure 15) are \nrecommended. In addition, we also recommend a m aximum ramp -down rate of <4 °C s−1. Vapor pha se or manual soldering \nshould not be used in order to avoid damaging of the sensor.  In case the PCB hosting the SGP40 chip passes through multiple \nsolder cycles, it is recommended to assemble the SGP 40 during the last solder cycle. Board wash a nd ultrasonic cleaning should \nbe avoided.  For general information (such as conformal coating), please also refer to the Handling and Assembly Instructions \nfor SGPxx Gas Sensors . \n \nFigure 15 Soldering profile according to JEDEC standard.
