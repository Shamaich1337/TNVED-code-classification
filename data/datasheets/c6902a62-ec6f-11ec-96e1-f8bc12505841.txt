It incorporates a  \nrevolutionary new circuit architecture to solve a long standing industry problem: \nhigh IP3, high attenuation range, low DC current, broad bandwidth, and \ntemperature -compensated linear in dB control voltage characteristic. This voltage \ncontrolled attenuator is controlled by a single positive control voltage with on chip \nDC conditioning circuitry. The slope polarity of the control voltage versus gain is \nselec table. The RFSA2033 draws a very low 2.5mA current. This attenuator is \nmatched to 50 Ω over its rated control range and frequency with no external \nmatching components require. Typical VCA’s in this performance category have \npoor inherent attenuation versus temperature and poor nonlinear attenuation \nversus control voltage characteristics. T o correct these shortcomings, other VCA’s \nrequire extensive off chip analog support circuitry that consume valuable PCB \narea and additional DC power. This game changing product incorporates the \ncomplete solution in a small 3mm x 3mm QFN package that reduce s the footprint \nin area and reduces the DC power over conventional PIN diode approaches.  \n \nOrdering Information  \nRFSA2033 SQ         Sample bag with 25 pieces  \nRFSA2033 SR         7” Reel with 100 pieces  \nRFSA2033 TR7         7” Reel with 250 0 pieces  \nRFSA2033 PCK-410      50MHz  to 60 00MHz PCBA with 5 -piece sample bag  \nRFSA2033PCK -411      CATV , 75Ω PCBA with 5 -piece sample bag  \n  \n32\n41\n1011\n912\n1514\n1613\n67\n58CONTROL\nBLOCK\nATTENRFIN RFOUTVCVDDSLOPE\nGND\nGND\nGNDGNDEN\nGNDGNDGNDGND\nGND NC \nFunctional Block Diagram  \n  RFSA2033  RFDA2046  \n \nRF MICRO DEVICES®, RFMD®, Optimum Technology Matching®, Enabling Wireless ConnectivityTM, PowerStar®, POLARISTM TOTAL RADIOTM and UltimateBlueTM are trademarks of RFMD, LLC .
