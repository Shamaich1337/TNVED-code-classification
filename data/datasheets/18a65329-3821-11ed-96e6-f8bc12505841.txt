ADP7104  with Adjustable Output Voltage, 5 V \n \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADP7104  is a CMOS, low dropout linear regulator that oper-\nates from 3.3 V to 20 V and provides up to 500 mA of output \ncurrent. This high input voltage LDO is ideal for regulation of high performance analog and mixed signal circuits operating from 19 V to 1.22 V rails. Using an advanced proprietary archi-\ntecture, it provides high power supply rejection, low noise, and \nachieves excellent line and load transient response with just a \nsmall 1 μF ceramic output capacitor. \nThe ADP7104  is available in seven fixed output voltage options \nand an adjustable version, which allows output voltages that range \nfrom 1.22 V to V\nIN − V DO via an external feedback divider. The ADP7104  output noise voltage is 15 μV rms and is inde-\npendent of the output voltage. A digital power-good output \nallows power system monitors to check the health of the output voltage. A user programmable precision undervoltage lockout \nfunction facilitates sequencing of multiple power supplies. \nThe ADP7104  is available in 8-lead, 3 mm × 3 mm LFCSP  \nand 8-lead SOIC packages. The LFCSP offers a very compact \nsolution and also provides excellent thermal performance for \napplications requiring up to 500 mA of output current in a \nsmall, low-profile footprint. \n \nADP7104 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

This is a stress rating only; functional operation of the product at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational \nsection of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond \nthe maximum operating conditions for extended periods may \naffect product reliability. \nTHERMAL DATA \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in \ncombination. The ADP7104  can be damaged when the junction \ntemperature limit is exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature \ndoes not guarantee that T J is within the specified temperature \nlimits. In applications with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature may \nhave to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low PCB \nthermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature can exceed the maximum limit as long as the junction temperature is within specification limits. The junction temperature (T\nJ) of \nthe device is dependent on the ambient temperature (T A), the \npower dissipation of the device (P D), and the junction-to-ambient \nthermal resistance of the package (θ JA).  \nMaximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated from the \nambient temperature (T A) and power dissipation (P D) using the \nformula  \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) \nJunction-to-ambient thermal resistance (θ JA) of the package is \nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4-layer board. The \njunction-to-ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on \nthe application and board layout. In applications where high maximum power dissipation exists, close attention to thermal board design is required. The value of θ\nJA may vary, depending on PCB material, layout, and environmental conditions. The specified values of θ\nJA are based on a 4-layer, 4 in. × 3 in. circuit \nboard. See JESD51-7 and JESD51-9 for detailed information on the board construction. For additional information, see the \nAN-617 Application Note . \nΨ\nJB is the junction-to-board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W . The package’s Ψ JB is based on modeling and \ncalculation using a 4-layer board. The JESD51-12, Guidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information , \nstates that thermal characterization parameters are not the same as thermal resistances. Ψ\nJB measures the component power \nflowing through multiple thermal paths rather than a single \npath as in thermal resistance, θ JB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths \ninclude convection from the top of the package as well as radiation from the package, factors that make Ψ\nJB more useful \nin real-world applications. Maximum junction temperature (T J) \nis calculated from the board temperature (T B) and power \ndissipation (P D) using the formula  \nTJ = TB + (PD × ΨJB) \nSee JESD51-8 and JESD51-12 for more detailed information about Ψ\nJB. \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE \nθJA and Ψ JB are specified for the worst-case conditions, that is, a \ndevice soldered in a circuit board for surface-mount packages . θJC \nis a parameter for surface-mount packages with top mounted heatsinks. \nθJC is presented here for reference only. \nTable 4.

I | Page 16 of 25 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADP7104  is a low quiescent current, low-dropout linear \nregulator that operates from 3.3 V to 20 V and provides up to \n500 mA of output current. Drawing a low 1 mA of quiescent current (typical) at full load makes the ADP7104  ideal for \nbattery-operated portable equipment. Typical shutdown \ncurrent consumption is 40 μA at room temperature. \nOptimized for use with small 1 μF ceramic capacitors, the \nADP7104  provides excellent transient performance.  \nSHUTDOWNVIN\nGND\nEN/\nUVLOVOUT\nREFERENCEVREG\nPGOOD PG\nSENSESHORT-CIRCUIT,\nTHERMAL\nPROTECT\n10µA\n09507-056 \nFigure 59.

Adjustable Output Voltage Internal Block Diagram \nInternally, the ADP7104  consists of a reference, an error amplifier, a \nfeedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass transistor. Output \ncurrent is delivered via the PMOS pass device, which is controlled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback voltage from the output and amplifies \nthe difference. If the feedback voltage is lower than the reference \nvoltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled lower, allowing more current to pass and increasing the output voltage. If the feedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing less current to \npass and decreasing the output voltage.  \nThe ADP7104  is available in seven fixed output voltage options, \nranging from 1.5 V to 9 V and in an adjustable version with an \noutput voltage that can be set to between 1.22 V and 19 V by an \nexternal voltage divider. The output voltage can be set according \nto the following equation: \nV\nOUT = 1.22 V(1 + R1/R2) \nVOUT = 5V VIN = 8V\nPGVOUT VIN\nPGGNDADJ\nEN/\nUVLORPG100kΩ\nR4\n100kΩR3\n100kΩCOUT1µFCIN\n1µF\nON\nOFF R2\n13kΩ+ + R1\n40.2kΩ\n09507-075 \nFigure 61. Typical Adjustable Output Voltage Application Schematic \nThe value of R2 should be less than 200 kΩ to minimize errors \nin the output voltage caused by the ADJ pin input current. For example, when R1 and R2 each equal 200 kΩ, the output voltage is 2.44 V . The output voltage error introduced by the ADJ pin input current is 2 mV or 0.08%, assuming a typical ADJ pin input \ncurrent of 10 nA at 25°C. \nThe ADP7104  uses the EN/UVLO pin to enable and disable \nthe VOUT pin under normal operating conditions. When \nEN/UVLO is high, VOUT turns on, when EN is low, VOUT \nturns off. For automatic startup, EN/UVLO can be tied to VIN. \nThe ADP7104  incorporates reverse current protections circuitry \nthat prevents current flow backwards through the pass element \nwhen the output voltage is greater than the input voltage. A comparator senses the difference between the input and output \nvoltages. When the difference between the input voltage and \noutput voltage exceeds 55 mV , the body of the PFET is switched to V\nOUT and turned off or opened. In other words, the gate is \nconnected to VOUT. \n \n \nData Sheet ADP7104\n \nRev. I | Page 17 of 25 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nOutput Capacitor \nThe ADP7104  is designed for operation with small, space-saving \nceramic capacitors but functions with most commonly used \ncapacitors as long as care is taken with regard to the effective series resistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the stability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of 1 μF capacitance \nwith an ESR of 1 Ω or less is recommended to ensure the stability \nof the ADP7104 . Transient response to changes in load current is \nalso affected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient response of the ADP7104  to \nlarge changes in load current. Figure 62 shows the transient \nresponses for an output capacitance value of 1 μF. \nCH2  50mV CH1 500mA M 20µs A  CH1      270mA1\n2\nT10%ΩLOAD CURRENT\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE\n09507-057 \nFigure 62. Output Transient Response, V OUT = 1.8 V, C OUT = 1 μF \nInput Bypass Capacitor \nConnecting a 1 μF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces  \nthe circuit sensitivity to printed circuit board (PCB) layout, \nespecially when long input traces or high source impedance  \nare encountered. If greater than 1 μF of output capacitance is \nrequired, the input capacitor should be increased to match it. \nInput and Output Capacitor Properties \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the \nADP7104 , as long as they meet the minimum capacitance and \nmaximum ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufac-\ntured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have a dielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over  \nthe necessary temperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R  \nor X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of 6.3 V to 25 V are recommended. Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are not recommended, \ndue to their poor temperature and dc bias characteristics.  Figure 63 depicts the capacitance vs. voltage bias characteristic \nof an 0402, 1 μF , 10 V , X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a capacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage \nrating exhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the \nX5R dielectric is ~±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature \nrange and is not a function of package or voltage rating. \n1.2\n1.00.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n02468 1 0CAPACITANCE (µF)\nVOLTAGE (V)\n09507-058 \nFigure 63.

I | Page 18 of 25 PROGRAMMABLE UNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT \n(UVLO) \nThe ADP7104  uses the EN/UVLO pin to enable and disable the \nVOUT pin under normal operating conditions. As shown in \nFigure 64, when a rising voltage on EN crosses the upper \nthreshold, VOUT turns on. When a falling voltage on EN/ \nUVLO crosses the lower threshold, VOUT turns off. The hysteresis of the EN/UVLO threshold is determined by the Thevenin equivalent resistance in series with the EN/UVLO pin. \n2.0\n1.8\n1.61.41.21.00.80.60.40.2\n1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00 1.000VOUT, EN RISE\nVOUT, EN FALL\n09507-060 \nFigure 64. Typical VOUT Response to EN Pin Operation \nThe upper and lower thresholds are user programmable and can \nbe set using two resistors. When the EN/UVLO pin voltage is below 1.22 V , the LDO is disabled. When the EN/UVLO pin \nvoltage transitions above 1.22 V , the LDO is enabled and 10 μA \nhysteresis current is sourced out the pin raising the voltage, thus providing threshold hysteresis. Typically, two external resistors program the minimum operational voltage for the LDO. The \nresistance values, R1 and R2 can be determined from: \nR1 = V\nHYS/10 μA \nR2 = 1.22 V × R1/(VIN − 1.22 V) \nwhere: \nVIN is the desired turn-on voltage. \nVHYS is the desired EN/UVLO hysteresis level.  Hysteresis can also be achieved by connecting a resistor in series with EN/UVLO pin. For the example shown in Figure 65, \nthe enable threshold is 2.44 V with a hysteresis of 1 V . \nVOUT = 5V VIN = 8V\nPGVOUT VIN\nPG\nGNDSENSE\nEN/\nUVLORPG\n100kΩ\nR2\n100kΩR1\n100kΩCOUT\n1µFCIN\n1µF\nON\nOFF+ +\n09507-059 \nFigure 65.

The start-up time for the 3.3 V option \nis approximately 580 μs from the time the EN active threshold is crossed to when the output reaches 90% of its final value.

This open-drain output requires an \nexternal pull-up resistor to VIN or VOUT. If the part is in shutdown mode, current-limit mode, or thermal shutdown, or \nif it falls below 90% of the nominal output voltage, the power-\ngood pin (PG) immediately transitions low. During soft-start, the rising threshold of the power-good signal is 93.5% of the \nnominal output voltage. \nThe open-drain output is held low when the ADP7104  has suffi-\ncient input voltage to turn on the internal PG transistor. The PG \ntransistor is terminated via a pull-up resistor to VOUT or VIN.  \nPower-good accuracy is 93.5% of the nominal regulator output \nvoltage when this voltage is rising, with a 90% trip point when \nthis voltage is falling. Regulator input voltage brownouts or \nglitches trigger power no good signals if V\nOUT falls below 90%. \nA normal power-down causes the power-good signal to go low \nwhen V OUT drops below 90%. \nFigure 67 and Figure 68 show the typical power-good rising and falling threshold over temperature. \n0123456\n4 . 24 . 34 . 44 . 54 . 64 . 74 . 84 . 95 . 0PG (V)\nVOUT (V)PG –40°C\nPG –5°CPG +25°C\nPG +85°C\nPG +125°C\n09507-062 \nFigure 67.

Typical Power-Good Threshold vs. Temperature, V OUT Falling NOISE REDUCTION OF THE ADJUSTABLE ADP7104  \nThe ultralow output noise of the fixed output ADP7104  is \nachieved by keeping the LDO error amplifier in unity gain  \nand setting the reference voltage equal to the output voltage. This architecture does not work for an adjustable output  \nvoltage LDO. The adjustable output ADP7104  uses the more \nconventional architecture where the reference voltage is fixed \nand the error amplifier gain is a function of the output voltage. The disadvantage of the conventional LDO architecture is that \nthe output voltage noise is proportional to the output voltage. \nThe adjustable LDO circuit may be modified slightly to reduce \nthe output voltage noise to levels close to that of the fixed output ADP7104 . The circuit shown in Figure 69 adds two \nadditional components to the output voltage setting resistor divider. C\nNR and R NR are added in parallel with R FB1 to reduce \nthe ac gain of the error amplifier. R NR is chosen to be equal to \nRFB2, this limits the ac gain of the error amplifier to approxi-\nmately 6 dB. The actual gain is the parallel combination of R NR \nand R FB1 divided by R FB2. This ensures that the error amplifier \nalways operates at greater than unity gain. \nCNR is chosen by setting the reactance of C NR equal to R FB1 −  \nRNR at a frequency between 50 Hz and 100 Hz. This sets the \nfrequency where the ac gain of the error amplifier is 3 dB  \ndown from its dc gain. \nVOUT = 5V VIN = 8V\nPGVOUT VIN\nPGGNDADJ\nEN/\nUVLOCOUT1µFCIN\n1µF\nON\nOFFRNR\n13kΩRFB2\n13kΩ+ + RFB1\n40.2kΩCNR100nF+\n09507-064RPG\n100kΩ\nR2\n100kΩR1\n100kΩ\n \nFigure 69.

I | Page 20 of 25 CURRENT LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADP7104  is protected against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by current and thermal overload protection \ncircuits. The ADP7104  is designed to current limit when the \noutput load reaches 600 mA (typical). When the output load exceeds 600 mA, the output voltage is reduced to maintain a \nconstant current limit. \nThermal overload protection is included, which limits the \njunction temperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme conditions (that is, high ambient temperature and/or high power dissipation) when the junction temperature starts to \nrise above 150°C, the output is turned off, reducing the output \ncurrent to zero. When the junction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on again, and output current is \nrestored to its operating value. \nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to ground \noccurs. At first, the ADP7104  current limits, so that only 600 mA \nis conducted into the short. If self heating of the junction is \ngreat enough to cause its temperature to rise above 150°C, \nthermal shutdown activates, turning off the output and reducing the output current to zero. As the junction temperature cools and drops below 135°C, the output turns on and conducts 600 mA into the short, again causing the junction temperature \nto rise above 150°C. This thermal oscillation between 135°C \nand 150°C causes a current oscillation between 600 mA and \n0 mA that continues as long as the short remains at the output. \nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect \nthe device against accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation, device power dissipation must be externally limited \nso the junction temperature does not exceed 125°C. \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS \nIn applications with low input-to-output voltage differential, the \nADP7104  does not dissipate much heat. However, in applications \nwith high ambient temperature and/or high input voltage, the  \nheat dissipated in the package may become large enough that  it causes the junction temperature of the die to exceed the \nmaximum junction temperature of 125°C.  \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter \nenters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction temperature has decreased below 135°C to prevent any permanent \ndamage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application \nis very important to guarantee reliable performance over all conditions. The junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient temperature of the environment and the tempera-ture rise of the package due to the power dissipation, as shown \nin Equation 2. To guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of  \nthe ADP7104  must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the \njunction temperature stays below this maximum value, the  user must be aware of the parameters that contribute to \njunction temperature changes. These parameters include \nambient temperature, power dissipation in the power device,  and thermal resistances between the junction and ambient air (θ\nJA). The θ JA number is dependent on the package assembly \ncompounds that are used and the amount of copper used to solder the package GND pins to the PCB. \nTable 6 shows typical θ\nJA values of the 8-lead SOIC and 8-lead \nLFCSP packages for various PCB copper sizes. Table 7 shows \nthe typical Ψ JB values of the 8-lead SOIC and 8-lead LFCSP . \nTable 6.

Typical Ψ JB Values \nModel Ψ JB (°C/W) \nLFCSP 15.1  \nSOIC 31.3 \nThe junction temperature of the ADP7104  is calculated from the \nfollowing equation: \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) (2) \nwhere: \nTA is the ambient temperature. \nPD is the power dissipation in the die, given by \nPD = [( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD] + ( VIN × IGND) (3) \nwhere: I\nLOAD is the load current. \nIGND is the ground current. \nVIN and V OUT are input and output voltages, respectively. \nPower dissipation due to ground current is quite small and can be ignored. Therefore, the junction temperature equation \nsimplifies to the following: \nT\nJ = TA + {[( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD] × θJA} (4) \nAs shown in Equation 4, for a given ambient temperature, input- \nto-output voltage differential, and continuous load current, there exists a minimum copper size requirement for the PCB  \nto ensure that the junction temperature does not rise above 125°C. \nFigure 70 to Figure 77 show junction temperature calculations for different ambient temperatures, power dissipation, and areas \nof PCB copper. \nData Sheet ADP7104\n \nRev.
