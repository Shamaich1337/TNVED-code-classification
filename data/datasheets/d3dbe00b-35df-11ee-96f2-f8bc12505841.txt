Simultaneous Read/Write Op erations with Zero Latency\nThe Simultaneous Read/Writ e architecture provides simultaneous operation  by dividing the memory space into four banks, two \n8 Mb banks with small and large sectors, and two 24 Mb banks of l arge sectors. Sector addresses are fixed, system software can b e \nused to form user-defined bank groups.\nDuring an Erase/Program operati on, any of the three non-busy ba nks may be read from. Note that  only two banks can operate \nsimultaneously. The device can im prove overall system performan ce by allowi ng a host system to program or erase in one bank, \nthen immediately and simultaneous ly read from the other bank, w ith zero latency. This releases the system f rom waiting for the  \ncompletion of program or erase operations.\nThe S29JL064J is organized as a dual boot device with both top and bottom boot sectors.\n1.1 S29JL064J Features\nThe Secured Silicon Region  is an extra 256 byte sector capabl e of being permanently locke d by Cypress or customers. The \nSecured Silicon Customer Indicator Bit (DQ6) is permanently set  to 1 if the part has been customer locked, and permanently set  to 0 \nif the part has been factory lo cked. This way, customer lockabl e parts can never be used to replac e a factory locked part.\nFactory locked parts provide sever al options. The Secured Silic on Region  may store a secure, random  16 byte ESN (Electronic \nSerial Number), customer code (pr ogrammed through Cypress progr amming services), o r both. Customer Lockable parts may \nutilize the Secured Silicon Region as bonus space, reading and writing like any other flash sector, or may permanently lock th eir own \ncode there.\nThe device offers complete  compatibility with the JEDEC 42.4 single-power-suppl y Flash command set standard . Commands \nare written to the command register using standard microprocess or write timings. Reading data out of the device is similar to reading \nfrom other Flash or EPROM devices.\nThe host system can detect whethe r a program or erase operation  is complete by us ing the device status bits: RY/BY# pin, DQ7 \n(Data# Polling) and DQ6/DQ2 (togg le bits). After a program or e rase cycle has been completed, the device automa tically returns  to \nthe read mode. \nThe sector erase architecture  allows memory sectors to be erased and reprogrammed without af fecting the data c ontents of other \nsectors. The device i s fully erased when s hipped from the facto ry.\nHardware data protection  measures include a low VCC detector that automat ically inhibits write operations during p ower \ntransitions. The hardware sector protection  feature disables both program and erase operations in any comb ination of the sectors \nof memory. This can be achieved in-system or via programming eq uipment.\nThe Erase Suspend/Erase Resume feature enables the u ser to put erase on hold for any period of  time to read data from, or \nprogram data to, any se ctor that is not sel ected for erasure. T rue background erase can thus b e achieved. If a read is needed from \nthe Secured Silicon Region (One Time Promgram area) after an er ase suspend, then the user mu st use the proper command \nsequence to enter an d exit this region. \nThe device offers two power-savi ng features. When addresses hav e been stable for a s pecified amount of time, the device enters  \nthe automatic sleep mode . The system can also plac e the device into the standby mode . Power consumption is greatly reduced in \nboth modes.Bank Mbits Sector Sizes\nBank 1 8 MbEight 8 kbyte/4 kword, \nFifteen 64 kbyte/32 kword\nBank 2 24 Mb Forty-eight 64 kbyte/32 kword\nBank 3 24 Mb Forty-eight 64 kbyte/32 kword\nBank 4 8 MbEight 8 kbyte/4 kword, \nFifteen 64 kbyte/32 kword\nDocument Number: 002-00856 Rev. *H Page 4 of 59S29JL064J\n2.

Device Bus Operations\nThis section describes the require ments and use of  the device b us operations, which are initiat ed through the internal command  \nregister. The command register i tself does not occupy any addre ssable memory location. The regi ster is a latch used to store t he \ncommands, along with the address and data information needed to  execute the command. The conte nts of the register serve as \ninputs to the internal  state machine. The state machine outputs  dictate the function of the device. Table  lists the device bus \noperations, the inputs and contro l levels they require, and the  resulting output. The following subsections describe each of t hese \noperations in further detail.\nLegend\nL = Logic Low = VIL\nH = Logic High = VIH\nVID = 11.5–12.5V\nVHH = 9.0 ± 0.5V\nX = Don’t Care\nSA = Sector Address\nAIN = Address In\nDIN = Data In\nDOUT = Data Out\nNotes:\n1. Addresses are A21:A0 in word mode (BYTE# = VIH), A21:A-1 in byte mode (BYTE# = VIL).\n2. The sector protect and sector unprotect functions may also be  implemented via programming equipment. See Boot Sector/Sector B lock Protection and Unprotection  \non page 18 .\n3. If WP#/ACC = VIL, sectors 0, 1, 140, and 141 remain protected. If WP#/ACC = VIH, protection on sectors 0, 1, 140, and 141 depends on whether they were last \nprotected or unprotected using the method described in Boot Sector/Sector Block Protection and Unprotection  on page 18 . If WP#/ACC = VHH, all sectors will be \nunprotected.\n8.1 Word/Byte Configuration\nThe BYTE# pin controls whether t he device data I /O pins operate  in the byte or word configura tion. If the BYTE# pin is set at logic \n‘1’, the device is in word configuration, D Q15–DQ0 are active a nd controlled by CE# and OE#.\nIf the BYTE# pin is set at logic ‘0’, the device is in byte con figuration, and only data I/O pin s DQ7–DQ0 are act ive and contr olled by \nCE# and OE#. The data I/O pins D Q14–DQ8 are tri- stated, and the  DQ15 pin is used as an input for the LSB (A-1) address functio n.

CE# is the power con trol and se lects the \ndevice. OE# is the output control  and gates array data to the o utput pins. WE# sh ould remain at VIH. The BYTE# pin determines \nwhether the device ou tputs array data i n words or bytes.\nThe internal state machine is s et for reading a rray data upon d evice power-up, or after a hardwa re reset. This ensures that no  \nspurious alteration of the memory content occurs during the pow er transition. No command is nec essary in this mode to obtain a rray \ndata. Standard microprocessor r ead cycles that assert valid add resses on the device address inpu ts produce valid data on the \ndevice data outputs. Each bank r emains enabled for read access until the command register  contents are altered.\nRefer to Read-Only Operations  on page 43  for timing specifications and to Figure 17.1 on page 43  for the timing diagram. ICC1 in DC \nCharacteristics  on page 39  represents the active current  specification for reading array data.\n8.3 Writing Commands/Command Sequences\nTo write a command or command s equence (which includes programm ing data to the device and eras ing sectors of memory), the \nsystem must drive W E# and CE# to VIL, and OE# to VIH.\nFor program operations, the BYTE# pin determines whether the de vice accepts program data in bytes or words. Refer to Word/Byte \nConfiguration  on page 10  for more information. \nThe device features an Unlock Bypass  mode to facilitate fa ster programming. On ce a bank enters the Unlock Bypass mode, only \ntwo write cycles are required to p rogram a word or byte, instea d of four. Byte/Word Program Command Sequence  on page 28  has \ndetails on programming data to the dev ice using both standard a nd Unlock Bypass command sequences.\nAn erase operation can erase one sector, multiple sectors, or t he entire device. Table  on page 16  indicates the add ress space that \neach sector occupies. Similarly, a sector address  is the address bits required to uniquely select a sector. Command Definitions  \non page 27  has details on erasing a sector  or the entire chip, or suspend ing/resuming the erase operation.\nThe device address space is d ivided into four banks. A bank address  is the address bits require d to uniquely select a bank.\nICC2 in the DC Characteristics  on page 39  represents the active current specification for the write mode . AC Characteristics  \non page 43  contains timing specification  tables and timing diagrams for w rite operations.\n8.3.1 Accelerated Program Operation\nThe device offers accelerated p rogram operations through the AC C function. This is one of two functions provided by the WP#/AC C \npin. This function is primarily intended to allow faster manufa cturing throughput at the factory. \nIf the system asserts VHH on this pin, the device automat ically enters the aforementione d Unlock Bypass mode, temporarily \nunprotects any protected secto rs, and uses the higher voltage o n the pin to reduce the time requi red for program operations. T he \nsystem would use a two-cycle program command sequence as requir ed by the Unlock Bypass mode. Removing VHH from the WP#/\nACC pin returns the device to normal operation. Note that VHH must not be asserted on WP# /ACC for operations other than \naccelerated programming, or devic e damage may result. In additi on, the WP#/ACC pin must not be left floating or unconnected; \ninconsistent behavior of t he device may result. See Write Protect (WP#)  on page 19  for related information.\n8.3.2 Autoselect Functions\nIf the system writes the autoselec t command sequence, the devic e enters the autoselect mode . The system can then read \nautoselect codes from the internal  register (which is separate from the memory array) on DQ15– DQ0. Standard read cycle timings  \napply in this mode. Refer to Autoselect Mode  on page 17  and Autoselect Command Sequence  on page 28  for more information.\n8.4 Simultaneous Read/Write O perations with Zero Latency\nThis device is capable of readin g data from one bank of memory while programming or erasing in another bank of memory. An eras e \noperation may also be suspended  to read from or program to anot her location within the same bank (except the sector being \nerased). Figure 17.8 on page 48  shows how read and  write cycles may be in itiated for simultane ous operation with zero latency. \nICC6 and ICC7 in the DC Characteristics  on page 39  represent the current specificat ions for read-while-program an d read-while-\nerase, respectively.\nDocument Number: 002-00856 Rev. *H Page 12 of 59S29JL064J\n8.5 Standby Mode\nWhen the system is not r eading or writing to the device, it can  place the device in the stan dby mode. In this mode, current \nconsumption is greatly reduced , and the outputs are placed in t he high impedance st ate, independent o f the OE# input. \nThe device enters the CMOS sta ndby mode when the CE# and RESET#  pins are both held at VCC ± 0.3V. (Note that this is a more \nrestricted voltage range than VIH.) If CE# and RESE T# are held at VIH, but not within VCC ± 0.3V, the device wil l be in the standby \nmode, but the standby current will be greater. The device requi res standard access time (tCE) for read access when the device is in \neither of these standby modes, before it is ready to read data.\nIf the device is desele cted during erasure or programming, the device draws active current unt il the operation is completed.\nICC3 in DC Characteristics  on page 39  represents the standby c urrent specification. \n8.6 Automatic Sleep Mode\nThe automatic sleep mo de minimizes Flash device energy consumpt ion. The device automati cally enables this mode when \naddresses remain stable for tACC + 30 ns. The automatic sleep mo de is independent of the CE#, WE #, and OE# control signals. \nStandard address access timings pr ovide new data when addresses  are changed. While in sleep m ode, output data is latched and \nalways availabl e to the system. ICC5 in DC Characteristics  on page 39  represents the automatic slee p mode current specification.\n8.7 RESET#: Hardware Reset Pin\nThe RESET# pin pr ovides a hardware method  of resettin g the devi ce to reading array da ta. When the RESET# pi n is driven low for  \nat least a period of tRP, the device immediately terminat es any operation in progress, tristates all output pin s, and ignores all read/\nwrite commands for the duration of the RESET# pulse. The device  also resets the internal state  machine to reading array data. The \noperation that was interrupted s hould be reinitia ted once the d evice is ready to accept another  command sequence, to ensure da ta \nintegrity.\nCurrent is reduced fo r the duration  of the RESET# pulse. When R ESET# is held at VSS ±0.3V, the device draws CMOS standby \ncurrent (ICC4). If RESET# is held at VIL but not within VSS ±0.3V, the standby curre nt will be greater.\nThe RESET# pin ma y be tied to the  system reset circuitry. A sys tem reset would thus also reset  the Flash memory , enabling the \nsystem to read the boo t-up firmware from the Flash memory. \nIf RESET# is asserted during a program or erase operation, the RY/BY# pin remains a “0” (busy) until the internal reset operat ion is \ncomplete, which requires a time of tREADY  (during Embedded Al gorithms). The system c an thus monitor RY/B Y# to determine \nwhether the reset operation is c omplete. If RESET # is asserted when a program or erase operatio n is not executing (RY/BY# pin is \n“1”), the reset operation is c ompleted within a time of tREADY  (not during Embedded Algorithms ). The system can read data tRH after \nthe RESET# pin returns to VIH.\nRefer to Hardware Reset (RESET#)  on page 44  for RESET# param eters and to Figure 17.2 on page 44  for the timing diagram.\nDocument Number: 002-00856 Rev. *H Page 13 of 59S29JL064J\n8.8 Output Disable Mode\nWhen the OE# input is at VIH, output from the devi ce is disabled. The output pins are place d in the high im pedance state.\n \n S29JL064J Sector Archit ecture  (Sheet 1 of 4)\nBank SectorSector Address\nA21–A12Sector Size\n(kbytes/kwords)(x8)\nAddress

Howeve r, the autoselect codes can also be accessed in-system \nthrough the command register.\nWhen using programming equipment , the autoselect mode requires VID on address pin A9. Address pins must be as shown in \nTable . In addition, when verifying se ctor protection, the sector add ress must appear on the appropria te highest order address bits \n(see Table  on page 16 ). Table  shows the remaining address bits  that are don’t care. When all  necessary bits ha ve been set as \nrequired, the programming equip ment may then read the correspon ding identifier code on DQ7–D Q0. However, the autoselect \ncodes can also be accessed in- system through the command regist er, for instances when the S29JL064J is erased or programmed \nin a system without a ccess to high voltage o n the A9 pin. The c ommand sequence is illustrated in Table  on page 32 . Note that if a \nBank Address (BA) on address bits A21, A20, and A19 is asserted during the third write cycle of t he autoselect command, the hos t \nsystem can read autoselect data from that bank and then immediately read array data  from another bank, without exiting the \nautoselect mode.\nTo access the autoselect codes  in-system, the host system can i ssue the autoselect command via the command register, as shown \nin Table  on page 32 . This method does not require VID. Refer to Autoselect Command Sequence  on page 28  for more information.\n \nLegend\nL = Logic Low = VIL\nH = Logic High = VIH\nBA = Bank Address\nSA = Sector Address\nX = Don’t care.

For sector \nunprotect, all unprotected sector s must first be protected prio r to the first sector unprotect write cycle. Note that the sector unprotect \nalgorithm unprotects all sectors in parallel. All previous ly protected sectors must be individually re-protected.  To change data in \nprotected sectors efficiently, t he temporary sector unprotect f unction is available.

This function is one o f two provided by the \nWP#/ACC pin.\nIf the system asserts VIL on the WP#/ACC pin, the device disables program and erase func tions in sectors 0 , 1, 140, and 141, \nindependently of whether those sec tors were protected or unprot ected using the method described in Boot Sector/Sector Block \nProtection and Unprotection  on page 18 .\nIf the system asserts VIH on the WP#/ACC pin, the device reverts to whether sectors 0, 1,  140, and 141 were last set to be protected \nor unprotected. That is, sector p rotection or unp rotection for these sectors depends on whether  they were last protected or \nunprotected using th e method described in Boot Sector/Sector Block Protection and Unprotection  on page 18 .\nNote that the WP#/ACC pin must n ot be left floating or unconnec ted; inconsistent behavior of the device may result.SA127–SA130 11110XXXXX 256 (4x64) kbytes\nSA131–SA1331111100XXX,\n1111101XXX,\n1111110XXX192 (3x64) kbytes\nSA134 1111111000 8 kbytes\nSA135 1111111001 8 kbytes\nSA136 1111111010 8 kbytesSA137 1111111011 8 kbytes\nSA138 1111111100 8 kbytes\nSA139 1111111101 8 kbytesSA140 1111111110 8 kbytes\nSA141 1111111111 8 kbytes\n WP#/ACC Modes\nWP# Input Voltage Device Mode\nVIL Disables programming and erasing in SA0, SA1, SA140, and SA141\nVIHEnables programming and erasing in SA0, SA1, SA140, and SA141, dependent on whether they were last \nprotected or unprotected.\nVHH Enables accelerated programming (ACC).

A sector block consi sts of two or more \nadjacent sectors that are protected or unprotected at the same time (see Table  on page 18 ).\nThis feature allows temporary unpr otection of previously protec ted sectors to change data in-system. The Temporary Sector \nUnprotect mode is activated by  setting the RESET# pin to VID. During this mode, formerly prot ected sectors can be programme d or \nerased by selecting the sector addresses. Once VID is removed from the RESET# pin,  all the previously protected s ectors are \nprotected again. Figure 8.1  shows the algorithm, and Figure 17.12 on page 50  shows the timing diagrams, for this feature. If the \nWP#/ACC pin is at VIL, sectors 0, 1, 140, a nd 141 will remain pro tected during the T emporary sector Unprotect mode.\nFigure 8.1  Temporary Sector Unprotect Operation\nNotes:\n1.

The Secured Silicon Region is 2 56 bytes in length, and may s hipped unprotected, allowing \ncustomers to utilize that secto r in any manner they choose, or may shipped locked at t he factory (upon customer request). The \nSecured Silicon Indicator Bit d ata will be 81h if factory locke d, 41h if customer locked, or 01h if neither. Refer to Table  on page 17  \nfor more details.\nThe system accesses the Secured Silicon Region through a comman d sequence (see Enter Secured Silicon Region/Exit Secured \nSilicon Region Command Sequence  on page 28 ). After the system has written t he Enter Secured Silicon Regio n command \nsequence, it may read the Secur ed Silicon Region by using the a ddresses normally occupied by th e boot sectors. This mode of \noperation continues until the syst em issues the Exit Secured Si licon Region command sequence, or until power is removed from t he \ndevice. On power-up, or following a hardware reset, the device reverts to sending commands to the first 256 bytes of Sector 0.  Note \nthat the ACC function and unlock bypass modes are not available when the Secured Silicon Region is enabled.\n8.13.1 Factory Locked: Secured Sil icon Region Programmed and Pro tected At the \nFactory\nIn a factory locked device, the Secured Silicon Region is prote cted when the device is shipped from the factory. The Secured S ilicon \nRegion cannot be modified in any w ay. The device is preprogramm ed with both a random  number and a secure ESN. The 8-word \nrandom number is at addresses 000000h–000007h in word mode (or 000000h–00000Fh in byte mode). The secure ESN is \nprogrammed in the next 8 words a t addresses 000008h–00000Fh (or  000010h–00001Fh in byte mode). The device is available \npreprogrammed with on e of the following:\n\uf06eA random, secure ESN only\n\uf06eCustomer code through Cypress programming services\n\uf06eBoth a random, secure ESN and cus tomer code through Cypress pro gramming services\nContact an your local sales offi ce for details on using Cypress  programming services.\n8.13.2 Customer Lockable: Secured Silicon Region NOT Programmed or Protected At \nthe Factory\nIf the security feature is not required, the Secured Silicon Re gion can be treated as an additional Flash memory space. The Se cured \nSilicon Region can be read any number of ti mes, but can be prog rammed and locked only once . Note that the accelerated \nprogramming (ACC) and unlock bypa ss functions are not available  when programming the S ecured Silicon Region.\n\uf06eWrite the three-cycle Enter Secured Silicon Region command sequ ence, and then follow the in-system sector protect algorithm as  \nshown in Figure 8.2 on page 21 , except that RESET# may be at either VIH or VID. This allows in-system pro tection of t he Secured \nSilicon Region without raising a ny device pin to a high voltage . Note that this method is only  applicable to the Secured Silic on \nRegion.\n\uf06eTo verify the protect/ unprotect status of t he Secured Silicon R egion, follow the algorithm shown in Figure 8.3 on page 23 .\nOnce the Secured Silicon Region is locked and verified, the sys tem must write the Exit Secured Silicon Region command sequence  \nto return to reading  and writing the remainder of the array.\nThe Secured Silicon Region lock mu st be used with caution since , once locked, there is no procedure available for unlocking th e \nSecured Silicon Region and none o f the bits in the Secured Sili con Region memory space can  be modified in any way. \nDocument Number: 002-00856 Rev. *H Page 23 of 59S29JL064J\nFigure 8.3  Secured Silicon Region Protect Verify\n8.14 Hardware Data Protection\nThe command sequen ce requirement  of unlock cycles for programmi ng or erasing provides data pr otection against inadvertent \nwrites (refer to Table  on page 32  for command definitions). In ad dition, the following hardware data protection measures prevent \naccidental erasure or programming , which might otherwise be cau sed by spurious system l evel signals during VCC power-up and \npower-down transitions, o r from system noise.\n8.14.1 Low VCC Write Inhibit\nWhen VCC is less than VLKO, the device does not accept any write cycles. This protects da ta during VCC power-up and power-down. \nThe command register and all inte rnal program/erase circuits ar e disabled, and the device reset s to the read mode. Subsequent \nwrites are ignored until VCC is greater than VLKO. The system must provide the prop er signals to t he control pin s to prevent \nunintentional writes when VCC is greater than VLKO.\n8.14.2 Write Pulse Glitch Protection\nNoise pulses of less than 5 ns (t ypical) on OE#, CE# or WE# do n ot initiate a write cycle.\n8.14.3 Logical Inhibit\nWrite cycles are inhibited by holding any one of OE# = VIL, CE# = VIH or WE# = VIH. To initiate a write cycle, CE# and WE# must be \na logical zero while OE# is a logical one.\n8.14.4 Power-Up Write Inhibit\nIf WE# = CE# = VIL and OE# = VIH during power up, the device does not accept commands on the ri sing edge of WE#.

Common Flash Memory Interface (CFI)\nThe Common Flash Interface (CFI) specification outlines device and host system software interr ogation handshake, which allows \nspecific vendor-specified software  algorithms to be used for en tire families of devices. Softwar e support can then be device-\nindependent, JEDEC ID-independent, and forward- and backward-co mpatible for the specified flash device families. Flash vendors  \ncan standardize their existing interfaces for long-term compati bility. \nThis device enters the CFI Quer y mode when the s ystem writes th e CFI Query command, 98h, to address 55h in word mode (or \naddress AAh in byte mode), any t ime the device is ready to read  array data. The system can read CFI information at the address es \ngiven in Table  on page 24  to Table  on page 26 . To terminate reading CFI data, the system must write the rese t command.The CFI \nQuery mode is not accessible when  the device is executing an Em bedded Program or emb edded Erase algorithm.\nThe system can also writ e the CFI query comm and when the device  is in the autoselect mode via the command register only (high \nvoltage method does not apply). The device enters the CFI query  mode, and the system can read CFI  data at the addresses given in \nTable  on page 24  to Table  on page 26 . The system must wr ite the reset command to return to reading array data.\nFor further information, please refer to the CFI Specification and CFI Publication 100.

Command Definitions\nWriting specific address and data sequences into the command re gister initiates device operations. Table  on page 32  defines the \nvalid register command sequences. Writing incorrect address and data values or writ ing them in the improper sequence may place \nthe device in an unknown state. A reset command is then  required to return the device to reading array data.\nAll addresses are latched on the falling edge of WE# or CE#, wh ichever happens later. All data is latched on the rising edge o f WE# \nor CE#, whichever happens first. Refer to AC Characteristics  on page 43  for timing diagrams.\n10.1 Reading Array Data\nThe device is automatically set to reading array data after dev ice power-up. No commands are re quired to retrieve data. Each b ank \nis ready to read array data af ter completing an Embedded Progra m or Embedded Erase algorithm.\nAfter the device accepts an Erase Suspend command, the correspo nding bank enters the erase-su spend-read mode, after which \nthe system can read dat a from any non-erase-suspended sector wi thin the same bank. The system  can read array data using the \nstandard read timing, except that  if it reads at an address wit hin erase-suspended sectors, the  device outputs status data. Af ter \ncompleting a programming operatio n in the Erase Suspend mode, t he system may once aga in read array dat a with the same \nexception. See Erase Suspend/Erase Resume Commands  on page 31  for more information.\nThe system must  issue the reset command to retu rn a bank to the read (or erase -suspend-read) mode if DQ5  goes high during an \nactive program or erase operati on, or if the bank is in the aut oselect mode. See Reset Command  on page 27  for more information.\nSee Requirements for Reading Array Data  on page 11  for more information. Read-Only Operations  on page 43  provides the read \nparameters, and Figure 17.1 on page 43  shows the timing diagram.\n10.2 Reset Command\nWriting the reset command resets  the banks to the read or erase -suspend-read mode. A ddress bits are don ’t cares for this \ncommand.\nThe reset command may be written betw een the sequen ce cycles in  an erase command sequence be fore erasing begins. This \nresets the bank to w hich the system was wri ting to the read mod e. Once erasure begi ns, however, the device ignores reset \ncommands until the ope ration is complete.\nThe reset command may be written betw een the sequen ce cycles in  a program command sequence before programming begins. \nThis resets the bank to which th e system was writing to the rea d mode. If the program command  sequence is written to a bank th at \nis in the Erase Suspe nd mode, writing the reset command returns  that bank to the erase-suspen d-read mode. Once programming \nbegins, however, the device igno res reset command s until the op eration is complete.\nThe reset command may be written betw een the sequen ce cycles in  an autoselect comm and sequence. Once in the autoselect \nmode, the reset command must be wr itten to return to the read m ode. If a bank entered the aut oselect mode while in the Erase \nSuspend mode, writing the reset  command returns that bank to th e erase-suspend-read mode.\nIf DQ5 goes high during a program or erase operation, writing t he reset command returns the ban k to the read mode (or erase-\nsuspend-read mode if that bank was  in Erase Suspend).

The  autoselect command sequence may be written to an address within a bank that is either in the re ad or \nerase-suspend-read mode. The auto select command may not be writ ten while the device is  actively programming or erasing in \nanother bank.\nThe autoselect command sequence is  initiated by first writing t wo unlock cycles. This  is followed by a thi rd write c ycle that contains \nthe bank address and the autose lect command. The bank then ente rs the autoselect mo de. The system may r ead any number of \nautoselect codes without re-init iating the command sequence.\nTable  on page 32  shows the address and data re quirements. To determine sector p rotection informa tion, the system m ust write to \nthe appropriate bank address ( BA) and sector address (SA). Table  on page 16  shows the address ra nge and bank number \nassociated with each sector. \nThe system must write the reset command to r eturn to the read m ode (or erase-suspend-read mode if the bank was previously in \nErase Suspend).\n10.4 Enter Secured Silicon Region/ Exit Secured Silicon Region Co mmand \nSequence\nThe system can access the Secured Silicon Region b y issuing the  three-cycle Enter Secured Sili con Region command sequence. \nThe device continues to access th e Secured Silicon Region until  the system issues the four-cycl e Exit Secured Silicon Region \ncommand sequence. The Exit Secur ed Silicon Region command seque nce returns the device to no rmal operation. The Secured \nSilicon Region is not accessible when the device is executing a n Embedded Program or em bedded Erase algorithm. Table  \non page 32  shows the address and data requ irements for both command seque nces. See also Secured Silicon Region  on page 22  for \nfurther information. Note that the ACC function and unlock bypass modes are not available when the Secured Silicon Region is \nenabled.\n10.5 Byte/Word Program Command Sequence\nThe system may program the devic e by word or byte, depending on  the state of the BYTE# pin. Prog ramming is a four-bus-cycle \noperation. The program command sequence is initiated by writing  two unlock write cycles, fo llowed by the pr ogram set-up \ncommand. The program address and  data are written next, which i n turn initiate the Embedded Pr ogram algorithm. The system is \nnot required to provide f urther controls or timings. The device au tomatically provides internal ly generated program pulses and \nverifies the progra mmed cell margin. Table  on page 32  shows the address and data requi rements for the byte program c ommand \nsequence.\nWhen the Embedded Program algorithm is complete, that bank then  returns to the read mode and addresses are no longer latched. \nThe system can determine the stat us of the progr am operation by  using DQ7, DQ6, or RY/BY#. Refer to Write Operation Status  \non page 33  for information on these status bits.\nAny commands written to the device during the Embedded Program Algorithm are ignored.  Note that a hardware reset  immediately \nterminates the program operatio n. The program command sequence should be reinitiated once that bank has returned to the read \nmode, to ensure data integrity. Note that the Secured Silicon Region, autoselect,  and CFI functions are unavailable when a program \noperation is in progress.\nProgramming is allowed in any s equence and across sector bounda ries. A bit cannot be programmed from 0 back to a 1. \nAttempting to do so may cause tha t bank to set DQ5 = 1, or caus e the DQ7 and DQ6 st atus bits to indicat e the operation was \nsuccessful. However, a succeedin g read will show that the data is still 0. Only er ase operations can convert a 0 to a 1.\nDocument Number: 002-00856 Rev. *H Page 29 of 59S29JL064J\n10.5.1 Unlock Bypass Command Sequence\nThe unlock bypass feature allows the system to program bytes or  words to a bank faster than using the standard program command  \nsequence. The unlock bypass command sequence is initiated by fi rst writing two unlock cycles. Th is is followed by a third writ e cycle \ncontaining the unlock bypass co mmand, 20h. That bank then enter s the unlock bypass mode. A two-cycle un lock bypass program \ncommand sequence is all that is re quired to program in this mod e. The first cycle in this seque nce contains t he unlock bypass \nprogram command, A0h; the seco nd cycle contains the program add ress and data. Additional data  is programmed in the same \nmanner. This mode dis penses with the initial two unlock cycles required in the standard program  command sequence, resulting in  \nfaster total pro gramming time. Table  on page 32  shows the requirements fo r the command sequence.\nDuring the unlock bypass mode, only the Unlock Bypass Program a nd Unlock Bypass Reset commands are valid. To exit the unlock \nbypass mode, the system must iss ue the two-cycle unlock bypass reset command sequence. (See Table  on page 32 ).\nThe device offers accelerated pr ogram operations  through the WP #/ACC pin. When th e system asserts VHH on the WP#/ACC pin, \nthe device automatic ally enters the Unlock Bypass mode. The sys tem may then write the two- cycle Unlock Bypass program \ncommand sequence. The device use s the higher voltage on the WP# /ACC pin to accelerate the oper ation. Note that the WP#/ACC \npin must not be at VHH for any operation ot her than accelerated programming, or devic e damage may result.  In addition, the WP#/\nACC pin must not be left floati ng or unconnected; inconsistent behavior of the device may result.\nFigure 10.1 on page 29  illustrates the algorithm for t he program operation. Refer to Erase and Program Operations  on page 46  for \nparameters, and Figure 17.5 on page 47  for timing diagrams.\nFigure 10.1  Program Operation\nNote:\n1.

The chip erase command  sequence is initiated by writing two unlock cycles, followed b y a \nset-up command. Two add itional unlock write  cycles are then fol lowed by the chip erase comman d, which in turn invokes the \nEmbedded Erase algorithm. The device does not require the system to preprogra m prior to erase. The Embedded Erase algorithm \nautomatically preprograms and ver ifies the entire memory for an  all zero data pattern prior to electrical erase. The  system is  not \nrequired to provide any controls or timings during these operat ions. Table  on page 32  shows the address and data requirements for \nthe chip erase command sequence.\nWhen the Embedded Erase algorithm is complete, that bank return s to the read mode and addresse s are no longer latched. The \nsystem can determine the status o f the eras e operation by using  DQ7, DQ6, DQ2, or RY/BY#. Refer to Write Operation Status  \non page 33  for information on these status bits.\nAny commands written during the chip erase operation are ignore d. However, note that a hardware reset  immediately terminates \nthe erase operation. If that occu rs, the chip erase command seq uence should be reinitiated once that bank has returned to read ing \narray data, to ensure data integrity. Note that the Secured Silicon Region, autosele ct, and CFI functions are unavailable when an \nerase operation is in progress.\nFigure 10.2 on page 31  illustrates the algorithm for  the erase operation. Refer to Erase and Program Operations  on page 46  for \nparameters, and Figure 17.7 on page 48  for timing diagrams.\n10.7 Sector Erase Command Sequence\nSector erase is a six bus cycle operation. The se ctor erase com mand sequence is initiated by writing two unlock cycles, follow ed by \na set-up command. Two additional unlo ck cycles are w ritten, and  are then followed by the address of the sector to be erased, a nd \nthe sector erase command. Table  on page 32  shows the address and data requirements for the sector erase c ommand sequence.\nThe device does not require the system to preprogram prior to erase. The Embedded Erase algorithm automatically programs and \nverifies the entire sector for an all zero data pattern prior t o electrical erase. The system i s not required to provide any c ontrols or \ntimings during these operations. \nAfter the command sequence is written, a sector erase time-out of 50 µs occurs. During the time -out period, additional sector \naddresses and sector e rase commands may be  written. However, th ese additional erase command s are only one bus cycle long \nand should be identical to the  sixth cycle of t he standard eras e command explained above. Loading  the sector erase buffer may be \ndone in any sequence, and the num ber of sectors may be from one  sector to all sectors. The time  between these a dditional cycle s \nmust be less than 50 µs, otherwise erasure may begin. Any sector  erase address and command fo llowing the exceeded time-out \nmay or may not be accepted. It is recommended that processor in terrupts be disabled during this t ime to ensure all commands ar e \naccepted. The interrupts can be  re-enabled after  the last Secto r Erase command is written. If any command other than 30h, B0h, \nF0h is input during the time-out period, the normal operation w ill not be guaranteed. The system must rewr ite the command \nsequence and any additional addresses and commands.\nThe system can monitor DQ3 to det ermine if the sector erase tim er has timed out (See the section on DQ3: Sector Erase Timer.).  \nThe time-out begins from the ri sing edge of the final WE# or CE # pulse (first ris ing edge) in the command sequence.\nWhen the Embedded Erase algorithm is complete, the bank returns  to reading array data and addresses are no longer latched. Not e \nthat while the Embedded Erase o peration is in progress, the sys tem can read data from the non- erasing bank. The system can \ndetermine the status of the era se operation by r eading DQ7, DQ6 , DQ2, or RY/BY# in the er asing bank. Refer to Write Operation \nStatus  on page 33  for information on  these stat us bits.\nOnce the sector erase operation has begun, only the Erase Suspe nd command is valid. All other commands are ignored. However, \nnote that a hardware reset immediately  terminates the erase op eration. If that occurs, the sector eras e command sequence should \nbe reinitiated once that bank has  returned to reading array dat a, to ensure data integrity. Note that the Secured Silicon Region, \nautoselect, and CFI functions are unavailable when an erase operation is in progress.\nFigure 10.2 on page 31  illustrates the algorithm for  the erase operation. Refer to Erase and Program Operations  on page 46  for \nparameters, and Figure 17.7 on page 48  for timing diagrams.\nDocument Number: 002-00856 Rev. *H Page 31 of 59S29JL064J\nFigure 10.2  Erase Operation\nNotes:\n1. See Table  on page 32  for erase command sequence.\n2. See the section on DQ3 for information on the sector erase timer.\n10.8 Erase Suspend/Erase Resume Commands\nThe Erase Suspend co mmand, B0h, allows the system to interrupt a sector erase operat ion and then read data  from, or program \ndata to, any sector not selected  for erasure. The bank address is required when writing this c ommand. This command is valid on ly \nduring the sector erase operation , including the 50 µs time-out period during the sector erase  command sequence. The Erase \nSuspend command is ignored if wr itten during the chip erase ope ration or Embedded Program algor ithm. The bank address must \ncontain one of the sectors cu rrently selected for erase.\nWhen the Erase Suspe nd command is written during the sector era se operation, the device requi res a maximum of 35 µs to \nsuspend the erase operation. How ever, when the Erase Suspend co mmand is written during the sect or erase time-out , the device \nimmediately terminates the time- out period and suspends the era se operation. \nAfter the erase operation has been suspended, the bank enters t he erase-suspend-read  mode. The system can  read data from or \nprogram data to any sector not se lected for erasure. (The devic e erase suspends  all sectors selected for erasure.) It is not \nrecommended to program the Secured Silicon Region after an eras e suspend, as proper device fu nctionality cannot be guaranteed.  \nReading at any address within erase-suspended sectors produces status information on DQ7–DQ 0. The system can use DQ7, or \nDQ6 and DQ2 together, to determi ne if a sector is actively eras ing or is erase-suspended. Refer to Write Operation Status  \non page 33  for information on these status bits.\nAfter an erase-suspended program  operation is complete, the ban k returns to the e rase-suspend-read m ode. The system can \ndetermine the status of the progr am operation usin g the DQ7 or DQ6 status bits,  just as in the standard  Byte Program  operation . \nRefer to Write Operation Status  on page 33  for more information.\nIn the erase-suspend-read mode, t he system can als o issue the a utoselect command sequence . The device allows reading \nautoselect codes even at addresse s within erasing sectors, sinc e the codes are not stored in the  memory array. When the device  \nexits the autoselect mode, the de vice reverts to the Erase Susp end mode, and is ready for anot her valid operation. Refer to \nAutoselect Mode  on page 17  and Autoselect Command Sequence  on page 28  for details. \nTo resume the sector  erase operatio n, the system must write the  Erase Resume command. The bank address of the erase-\nsuspended bank is required when writing this command. Further w rites of the Resume command are ignored. A nother Erase \nSuspend command can be written after the ch ip has resumed erasi ng.

The system may read and program in non-erasing sectors, or enter the autoselect mode, when in the Erase Suspend mode. The Er ase Suspend command is valid \nonly during a sector erase operation, and requires the bank address.\n15. The Erase Resume command is valid only during th e Erase Suspend mode, and requires the bank address. \n16. Command is valid when device is ready to read array data or w hen device is in autoselect mode. \n17. Additional sector erase commands during the time-out period after an initial sector erase are one cycle long and identical t o the sixth cycle of \nthe sector erase command sequence (SA / 30).\n11. Write Operation Status\nThe device provides se veral bits to determin e the status of a p rogram or erase operation: DQ2 , DQ3, DQ5, DQ6, and DQ7. Table  \non page 38  and the following subsections de scribe the function of these b its. DQ7 and DQ6 each offer  a method for determining \nwhether a program or erase operat ion is complete or in progress . The device also provides a hardware-based out put signal, RY/\nBY#, to determine whether an Emb edded Program or Erase operatio n is in progress or has been completed.\n11.1 DQ7: Data# Polling\nThe Data# Polling bit, DQ7, indi cates to the host system whethe r an Embedded Program o r Erase algorithm is in progress or \ncompleted, or whether a bank is in Erase Suspend. Data# Polling  is valid after the rising edge of the final WE# pulse in the c ommand \nsequence.\nDuring the Embedded Program algorithm, the device outputs on DQ 7 the complement of the datum programmed to DQ7. This DQ7 \nstatus also applies to programmi ng during Erase Suspend. When t he Embedded Program algorithm is c omplete, the device outputs \nthe datum programmed to DQ7. T he system must provide the progra m address to read valid status information on DQ7. If a program  \naddress falls within a protecte d sector, Data# Polling on DQ7 i s active for approximately 1 µs, then that bank returns to the r ead \nmode. \nDuring the Embedded Erase algorit hm, Data# Polling produces a 0 on DQ7. When the Embedded Erase algorithm is complete, or if \nthe bank enters the Erase Susp end mode, Data# Polling produces a 1 on DQ7. The system  must provide an add ress within any of \nthe sectors selected fo r erasure to read va lid status informati on on DQ7.\nAfter an erase command sequence is written, if all sectors sele cted for erasing are p rotected, Data# Polling on DQ7 is active for \napproximately 3 ms, then the bank returns to the read mode. If n ot all selected sectors are protected, the Embedded Erase algor ithm \nerases the unprotect ed sectors, and ignore s the selected sector s that are protected . However, if the syst em reads D Q7 at an \naddress within a protected sector , the status may not be valid.\nWhen the system detects DQ7 has c hanged from the complement to true data, it can r ead valid data at DQ1 5–DQ0 (or DQ7–DQ0 \nfor x8-only device) on the following  read cycles. Just prior to the completion of an Embedded Progr am or Erase operation, DQ7 may \nchange asynchronously with DQ15–DQ8 (DQ7–DQ 0 for x8-only device ) while Output Enable (OE#) is asserted low. That is, the \ndevice may change from providing status information to valid da ta on DQ7. Depending on when t he system samples the DQ7 \noutput, it may read the status o r valid data. Even if the devic e has completed the program or er ase operation and DQ7 has vali d \ndata, the data outputs on DQ15– DQ0 may be still invalid. Valid data on DQ15–DQ0 (or DQ7–DQ0 for  x8-only device) will appear on  \nsuccessive read cycles.\nTable  on page 38  shows the outputs for Data# Polling on DQ7. Figure 11.1 on page 34  shows the Data# Polling algorithm. \nFigure 17.9 on page 49  shows the Data# Polling timing diagram.\nDocument Number: 002-00856 Rev. *H Page 34 of 59S29JL064J\nFigure 11.1  Data# Polling Algorithm\nNotes:\n1. VA = Valid address for programming. During a sector erase operat ion, a valid address is any sector address within the sector being erased. During chip erase, a valid \naddress is any non-prot ected sector address.\n2. DQ7 should be rechecked even if DQ5 = 1 because DQ7 may change simultaneously with DQ5.\n11.2 RY/BY#: Ready/Busy#\nThe RY/BY# is a dedicated, open- drain output pin which indicate s whether an Embedded Algorithm i s in progress or complete. The  \nRY/BY# status is valid after the rising edge of the final WE# p ulse in the command sequence. Since RY/BY# is an open-drain out put, \nseveral RY/BY# pins can be tied  together in parallel with a pul l-up resistor to VCC.\nIf the output is low (Busy), the device is actively erasing or programming. (This includes programming in the Erase Suspend mo de.) \nIf the output is high (Ready), the  device is in t he read mode, the standby mode,  or one of the banks is i n the erase-suspend-r ead \nmode.\nTable  on page 38  shows the outputs for RY/BY#. \nWhen DQ5 is set to “1”, RY/BY#  will be in the BUSY state, or “0 ”.$1\x17å\x1då$ATA\x1f9ES\n.O\n.O$1\x15å\x1då\x11\x1f.O\n9ES\n9ES\n&!), 0!332EADå$1\x17n$1\x10\n!DDRå\x1då6!\n2EADå$1\x17n$1\x10\n!DDRå\x1då6!\n$1\x17å\x1då$ATA\x1f34!24\nDocument Number: 002-00856 Rev. *H Page 35 of 59S29JL064J\n11.3 DQ6: Toggle Bit I\nToggle Bit I on DQ6 indicates whether an Embedd ed Program or Er ase algorithm is in progress or c omplete, or whether the device  \nhas entered the Erase Suspend mode. Toggle Bit I may be read at  any address, and is valid after the risi ng edge of the final W E# \npulse in the command sequence (pr ior to the program or erase op eration), and during the sector erase time-out.\nDuring an Embedded Program or Er ase algorithm ope ration, succes sive read cycles to any addre ss cause DQ6 to  toggle. The \nsystem may use either OE# or CE#  to contro l the read cycles. Wh en the operation is compl ete, DQ6 stops toggling.\nAfter an erase command sequence is written, if all sectors sele cted for erasing are p rotected, DQ6 toggles for approximately 3 ms, \nthen returns to reading array data. If not all selected sectors  are protected, the Embedded Eras e algorithm erases the unprote cted \nsectors, and ignores the selected sectors that are protected. \nThe system can use DQ6 and DQ2 t ogether to determine whether a sector is actively e rasing or is erase-suspended. When the \ndevice is actively era sing (that is, the Embedded Erase algorit hm is in progress), DQ6 toggles . When the device enters the Era se \nSuspend mode, DQ6 sto ps toggling. However , the system must also  use DQ2 to determine which sectors are erasing or erase-\nsuspended. Alternatively, th e system can use DQ7 (see DQ7: Data# Polling  on page 33 ).\nIf a program address falls withi n a protected sector, DQ6 toggl es for approximately 1 µs after the program command sequence is \nwritten, then returns to reading array data.\nDQ6 also toggles during the eras e-suspend-program  mode, and sto ps toggling once the Embedded Prog ram algorithm is complete.\nDocument Number: 002-00856 Rev. *H Page 36 of 59S29JL064J\nFigure 11.2  Toggle Bit Algorithm\nNote:\nThe system should recheck the toggle bit even if DQ5 = 1 because the toggle bit may stop toggling as DQ5 changes to 1. See the subsections on DQ6 and DQ2 for more \ninformation.\n11.4 DQ2: Toggle Bit II\nThe Toggle Bit II  on DQ2, when used wit h DQ6, indicates whet her a particular sec tor is actively erasing (that is, the Embedded \nErase algorithm is in progress) , or whether that sector is eras e-suspended. Toggle Bit II is valid after the rising edge of th e final WE# \npulse in the command sequence.\nDQ2 toggles when the system reads  at addresses within those sec tors that have been s elected for erasure.  (The system may use \neither OE# or CE# to control the read cycles.) But DQ2 cannot d istinguish whether the sector is actively erasing or is erase-\nsuspended. DQ6, by comparison, in dicates whether the device is actively erasing, or is in Erase Suspend, but cannot distinguis h \nwhich sectors are se lected for erasure. T hus, both status bits are required for sector and m ode information. Refer to Table  \non page 38  to compare outputs for DQ2 and DQ6. \nFigure 11.2 on page 36  shows the toggle bit algorithm in flowchart form, and DQ2: Toggle Bit II  on page 36  explains the algorithm. \nSee also DQ6: Toggle Bit I  on page 35 .

W henever the system initially be gins reading toggle bi t status, it must \nread DQ15–DQ0 (or DQ7–DQ0 for x8-only device) at least twice in  a row to determine whether a toggle bit is toggling. Typically , the \nsystem would note and store the va lue of the toggl e bit after t he first read. After the second r ead, the system would compare the new \nvalue of the toggle bit with t he first. If the toggle bit is no t toggling, the device has compl eted the program or erase opera tion. The \nsystem can read array data on DQ15–DQ0 (or DQ7–DQ0 for x8-only device) on the following read cycle.\nHowever, if after th e initial two read cycles, the system deter mines that the toggle bit is s till toggling, the system also sh ould note \nwhether the value of DQ5 is high (see the sectio n on DQ5). If i t is, the system should then det ermine again whether the toggle  bit is \ntoggling, since the toggle bit m ay have stopped toggling just a s DQ5 went high. If the toggle bit is no longer toggling, the d evice has \nsuccessfully completed the program or erase operation. If it is  still toggling, the device did not completed the operation suc cessfully, \nand the system must write the reset comma nd to return to readin g array data. \nThe remaining scenario is that the system initially determines that the toggle bit is toggling and DQ5 has not gone high. The system \nmay continue to monitor the toggle bit and DQ5 through successi ve read cycles, determining the status as described in the prev ious \nparagraph. Alternati vely, it may choose to perform other system  tasks. In this case,  the system must star t at the beginning of  the \nalgorithm when it returns to det ermine the status  of the operat ion (top of Figure 11.2 on page 36 ).\n11.6 DQ5: Exceeded Timing Limits\nDQ5 indicates whether the program or erase time has exceeded a specified internal pulse count l imit. Under these conditions DQ 5 \nproduces a 1, indicating that the program or erase cycle was not successful ly completed.\nThe device may output a 1 on DQ5 if the system  tries to program a 1 to a location that was p reviously programmed to 0. Only an \nerase operation can change a 0 back to a 1. Under this condition, the devic e halts the oper ation, and when  the timing limit has \nbeen exceeded, DQ5 produces a 1.\nUnder both these cond itions, the system mus t write the reset co mmand to return to the read mode (or to the erase-suspend-read \nmode if a bank was previously in  the erase-suspend-program mode ).\n11.7 DQ3: Sector Erase Timer\nAfter writing a sector erase c ommand sequence, the system may r ead DQ3 to determine whether o r not erasure has begun. (The \nsector erase timer does not apply to the chip erase command.) I f additional sectors are selected for erasure, the entire time- out also \napplies after each additional se ctor erase command. When the ti me-out period is complete, DQ3 switches from a 0 to a 1. If the time \nbetween additional se ctor erase commands from the system can be  assumed to be less than 50 µs,  the system need not monitor \nDQ3. See also Sector Erase Command Sequence  on page 30 .\nAfter the sector erase command  is written, the system should re ad the status of DQ7 (Data# Polling) or DQ6 (Toggle Bit I) to e nsure \nthat the device has accepted th e command sequenc e, and then rea d DQ3. If DQ3 is 1, the Embedded Erase al gorithm has begun; \nall further commands (except Er ase Suspend) are ignored until t he erase operation is complete. If DQ3 is 0, the device will accept \nadditional sector erase commands . To ensure the command has bee n accepted, the system software  should check the status of \nDQ3 prior to and fol lowing each subsequent sector erase command . If DQ3 is high on the second sta tus check, the last command \nmight not have b een accepted. T he RDY/BSY# pin w ill be in the B USY state under this condition.\nTable  on page 38  shows the status of DQ3 relat ive to the other status bits.\nDocument Number: 002-00856 Rev. *H Page 38 of 59S29JL064J\nNotes:\n1. DQ5 switches to 1 when an Embedded Program or Embedded Erase operation has exceeded the maximum timing limits. Refer to the section on DQ5 for m ore \ninformation.\n2. DQ7 and DQ2 require a valid address when reading status info rmation. Refer to the appropriate subsection for further details.\n3. When reading write operation status bits, the system must always provide the bank address where the Embedded Algorithm is in progress. The device outputs array \ndata if the system addr esses a non-busy bank.\n12. Absolute Maximum Ratings\nNotes:\n1. Minimum DC voltage on input or I/O pins is –0.5V. Duri ng voltage transitions, input or I/O pins may overshoot VSS to –2.0V for periods of up to 20 ns. Maximum DC \nvoltage on input or I/O pins is VCC +0.5V. See Figure 12.1 on page 38 . During voltage transitions, input or I/O pins may overshoot to VCC +2.0V for periods up to 20 ns. \nSee Figure 12.2 on page 39 .\n2. Minimum DC input voltage on pins A9, OE#, RESET#, and WP#/ACC is –0.5V. During voltage transitions, A9, OE#, WP#/ACC, and RES ET# may overshoot VSS to –\n2.0V for periods of up to 20 ns. See Figure 12.1 on page 38 . Maximum DC input voltage on pin A9 is +12.5V whic h may overshoot to +14.0V for periods up to 20 ns. \nMaximum DC input voltage on WP#/ACC is +9.5V which may overshoot to +12.0V for periods up to 20 ns.\n3. No more than one output may be shorted to ground at a time. Duration of the short circuit should not be greater than one seco nd.\n4. Stresses above those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress ratin g only; functional operation of the \ndevice at these or any other conditions abov e those indicated in the operational sections of this data sheet is not implied.
