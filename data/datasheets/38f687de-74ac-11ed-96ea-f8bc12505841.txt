A ferroelectric random access\nmemory or F-RAM is nonvolatile and performs reads and writes\nsimilar to a RAM. It provides reliable data retention for 151 y ears\nwhile eliminating the complexities, overhead, and system-level\nreliability problems caused by serial flash, EEPROM, and other\nnonvolatile memories. \nUnlike serial flash and EEPROM, the FM25V20A performs write\noperations at bus speed. No write delays are incurred. Data iswritten to the memory array immediately after each byte is\nsuccessfully transferred to the device. The next bus cycle can\ncommence without the need for data polling. In addition, theproduct offers substantial write endurance compared with other\nnonvolatile memories. The FM25V20A is capable of supporting\n10\n14 read/write cycles, or 100 million times more write cycles\nthan EEPROM. \nThese capabilities make the FM25V20A ideal for nonvolatile\nmemory applications, requirin g frequent or rapid writes.\nExamples range from data collection, where the number of write\ncycles may be critical, to demandi ng industrial controls where the\nlong write time of serial flash  or EEPROM can cause data loss. \nThe FM25V20A provides substantial benefits to users of serial\nEEPROM or flash as a hardware drop-in replacement. The\nFM25V20A uses the high-speed SPI bus, which enhances the\nhigh-speed write capability of F-RAM technology. The deviceincorporates a read-only Device ID that allows the host to\ndetermine the manufacturer, product density, and product\nrevision. The device specific ations are guaranteed over an\nindustrial temperature range of –40 \uf0b0C to +85 \uf0b0C.\nFor a complete list of re lated documentation, click here.\nInstruction Decoder\nClock Generator\nControl Logic\nWrite Protect\nInstruction Register\nAddress Register \nCounter256 K x 8\nFRAM Array\n18\nData I/O Register8\nNonvolatile Status\nRegister3WP\nCS\nSCK\nSO SILogic Block Diagram\nDocument Number: 001-90261 Rev. *I Page 2 of 21\nFM25V20A\nContents\nPin Definitions ............................................... ...................3\nOverview ...................................................... ......................4\nMemory Architecture ......... .................................. ........4\nSerial Peripheral Interface – SPI Bus ......................... .4\nSPI Overview .................................................. .............4\nSPI Modes ..................................................... ..............5\nPower Up to First Access ...................................... ......5\nCommand Structure ............................................. .......6\nWREN - Set Write Enable Latch  .......... ........... ............ 6\nWRDI - Reset Write Enable Lat ch ............................... 6\nStatus Register and Write Protection .......................... ...7\nRDSR - Read Status Register ................................... ..7\nWRSR - Write Status Register  .................................. ..8\nMemory Operation .............................................. ..............9\nWrite Operation ............................................... ............9\nRead Operation ................................................ ...........9\nFast Read Operation ........................................... ........9\nSleep Mode .................................................... ...........10\nDevice ID ..................................................... ..............10\nEndurance ..................................................... ............11\nMaximum Ratings ............................................... ............12Operating Range ............................................... .............. 12\nDC Electrical Characteristi cs ................................. ....... 12\nData Retention and Endurance .................................. ... 13\nCapacitance ................................................... ................. 13\nThermal Resistance ............................................ ............ 13\nAC Test Conditions ............................................ ............ 13\nAC Switching Characteristics .................................. ..... 14\nPower Cycle Timing ............................................ ........... 15\nOrdering Information .......................................... ............ 16\nOrdering Code Definitions ..................................... .... 16\nPackage Diagrams .............................................. ............ 17\nAcronyms ...................................................... .................. 19\nDocument Conventions .......................................... ....... 19\nUnits of Measure .............................................. ......... 19\nDocument History Page ......................................... ........ 20\nSales, Solutions, and Legal Information ...................... 2 1\nWorldwide Sales and Design S upport ......... .............. 21\nProducts ...................................................... .............. 21\nPSoC® Solutions ............................................... ....... 21\nCypress Developer Community . ................................ 21\nTechnical Support ........... .................................. ........ 21\nDocument Number: 001-90261 Rev. *I Page 3 of 21\nFM25V20A\nPinouts\nFigure 1.  8-pin SOIC Pinout\nFigure 2.  8-pin DFN PinoutHOLD\nSCK1\n2\n3\n4  5CS  8\n 7\n 6VDD\nSISO Top View\nnot to scale\nVSSWPDNU\nSOCS\nVSSWP\nSIVDD\nSCKHOLD1\n2\n43\n5678\nPADEXPOSED\nTop View\nnot to scaleDNU\nPin Definitions\nPin Name I/O Type Description\nCS Input Chip Select .

The memory array is\nlogically organized as 262,144 × 8 bits and is accessed using a n\nindustry-standard SPI bus. The functional operation of theF-RAM is similar to serial flash and serial EEPROMs. The majordifference between the FM25V20A and a serial flash or\nEEPROM with the same pinout is the F-RAM\'s superior write\nperformance, high endurance, and low power consumption. \nMemory Architecture\nWhen accessing the FM25V20A, the user addresses 256K\nlocations of eight data bits each. These eight data bits are sh ifted\nin or out serially. The addresses are accessed using the SPI\nprotocol, which includes a chip select (to permit multiple devi ces\non the bus), an opcode, and a three-byte address. The upper 6\nbits of the address range are \'don\'t care\' values. The complete\naddress of 18 bits specifies  each byte address uniquely. \nMost functions of the FM25V20A  are either controlled by the SPI\ninterface or handled by on-board circuitry. The access time forthe memory operation is essentially zero, beyond the time\nneeded for the serial protocol. That is, the memory is read or\nwritten at the speed of the SPI bus. Unlike a serial flash orEEPROM, it is not necessary to poll the device for a ready\ncondition because writes occur at bus speed. By the time a new\nbus transaction can be shifted into the device, a write operati on\nis complete. This is explained in more detail in the interface\nsection. \nSerial Peripheral Interface – SPI Bus\nThe FM25V20A is a SPI slave device and operates at speeds up\nto 40 MHz. This high-speed serial bus provides high-perfor-mance serial communication to a SPI master. Many common\nmicrocontrollers have hardware SPI ports allowing a direct\ninterface. It is quite simple to emulate the port using ordinar y port\npins for microcontrollers that do not. The FM25V20A operates in\nSPI Mode 0 and 3. \nSPI Overview\nThe SPI is a four-pin interface with Chip Select (CS ), Serial Input\n(SI), Serial Output (SO), a nd Serial Clock (SCK) pins. \nThe SPI is a synchronous serial interface, which uses clock and\ndata pins for memory access and supports multiple devices onthe data bus. A device on the SP I bus is activate d using the CS\npin. \nThe relationship between chip select, clock, and data is dictat ed\nby the SPI mode. This device supports SPI modes 0 and 3. In\nboth of these modes, data is clocked into the F-RAM on the risi ng\nedge of SCK starting from the first rising edge after CS  goes\nactive. \nThe SPI protocol is controlled by opcodes. These opcodes\nspecify the commands from the bus master to the slave device.\nAfter CS  i s  a c t i v a t e d ,  t h e  f i r s t  b yte transferred from the bus\nmaster is the opcode. Followin g the opcode, any addresses and\ndata are then transferred. The CS  must go inactive after an\noperation is complete and befor e a new opcode can be issued.\nThe commonly used terms in the SPI protocol are as follows:SPI Master\nThe SPI master device controls the operations on a SPI bus. An\nSPI bus may have only one master with one or more slave\ndevices. All the slaves share the same SPI bus lines and the\nmaster may select any of the slave devices using the CS  pin. All\nof the operations must be initiated by the master activating aslave device by pulling the CS\n pin of the slave LOW. The master\nalso generates the SCK and all the data transmission on SI and\nSO lines are synchroni zed with this clock. \nSPI Slave\nThe SPI slave device is activated  by the master through the Chi p\nSelect line. A slave device gets the SCK as an input from the S PI\nmaster and all the communicat ion is synchronized with this\nclock. An SPI slave never initiates a communication on the SPI\nbus and acts only on the inst ruction from the master.\nThe FM25V20A operates as an SPI slave and may share the SPI\nbus with other SPI slave devices. \nChip Select (CS )\nTo select any slave device, the master needs to pull down the\ncorresponding CS  pin. Any instruction can be issued to a slave\ndevice only while the CS  pin is LOW. When the device is not\nselected, data through the SI pin is ignored and the serial out put\npin (SO) remains in a high-impedance state.\nNote  A new instruction must begin with the falling edge of CS .\nTherefore, only one opcode can be issued for each active ChipSelect cycle.\nSerial Clock (SCK)\nThe Serial Clock is generated by the SPI master and the commu-\nnication is synchronized with this cl ock after CS\n goes LOW.\nThe FM25V20A enables SPI modes 0 and 3 for data communi-\ncation. In both of these modes, the inputs are latched by the\nslave device on the rising edge of SCK and outputs are issued\non the falling edge. Therefore, the first rising edge of SCKsignifies the arrival of the first bit (MSB) of a SPI instructi on on\nthe SI pin. Further, all data in puts and outputs are synchroniz ed\nwith SCK.\nData Transmission (SI/SO)\nThe SPI data bus consists of two lines, SI and SO, for serial d ata\ncom munication.  SI is also referred to as M ast er  Out Slave I n(MOSI) and SO is referred to as Master In Slave Out (MISO). The\nmaster issues instructions to the slave through the SI pin, whi le\nthe slave responds through the SO pin. Multiple slave devicesmay share the SI and SO lines as described earlier.\nThe FM25V20A has two separate pins for SI and SO, which can\nbe connected with the master as shown in Figure 3 .\nFor a microcontroller that has no dedicated SPI bus, a\ngeneral-purpose port may be used. To reduce hardwareresources on the controller, it is possible to connect the two data\npins (SI, SO) together and tie off (HIGH) the WP\n pin. Figure 4\nshows such a configuration, w hich uses only three pins.\nDocument Number: 001-90261 Rev. *I Page 5 of 21\nFM25V20A\nMost Significant Bit (MSB)\nThe SPI protocol requires that the first bit to be transmitted is the\nMost Significant bit (MSB). This is valid for both address and data\ntransmission. \nThe 2-Mbit serial F-RAM require s a 3-byte address for any read\nor write operation. Because the address is only 18 bits, the fi rst\nsix bits, which are fed in are ignored by the device. Although\nthese six bits are ‘don’t care ’, Cypress recommends that these\nbits be set to 0s to enable seamless transition to higher memor y\ndensities.\nSerial Opcode\nAfter the slave device  is selected with CS  going LOW, the first\nbyte received is treated as the o pcode for the intended operati on.\nFM25V20A uses the standard opc odes for memory accesses.\nInvalid Opcode\nIf an invalid opcode is received, the opcode is ignored and the\ndevice ignores any additional serial data on the SI pin until t he\nnext falling edge of CS , and the SO pin remains tristated.\nStatus Register\nFM25V20A has an 8-bit Status Register. The bits in the Status\nRegister are used to configure the device. These bits are\ndescribed in Table 3 on page 7 .\nFigure 3.  System Configuration with SPI Port\nFigure 4.  System Configuration without SPI PortSPI Modes\nFM25V20A may be driven by a microcontroller with its SPI\nperipheral running in either of the following two modes:\n■SPI Mode 0 (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0)\n■SPI Mode 3 (CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1)\nFor both these modes, the input data is latched in on the risin g\nedge of SCK starting from the first rising edge after CS  goes\nactive. If the clock starts from a HIGH state (in mode 3), the first\nrising edge after the clock toggl es is considered. The output d ata\nis available on the fa lling edge of SCK. \nThe two SPI modes are shown in Figure 5  and Figure 6 . The\nstatus of the clock when the bus master is not transferring dat a is:\n■SCK remains at 0 for Mode 0 \n■SCK remains at 1 for Mode 3 \nThe device detects the SPI mode from the status of the SCK pin\nwhen the device is selected by bringing the CS  pin LOW. If the\nSCK pin is LOW when the device is selected, SPI Mode 0 isassumed and if the SCK pin is  HIGH, it works in SPI Mode 3.\nFigure 5.  SPI Mode 0\nFigure 6.  SPI Mode 3\nPower Up to First Access\nThe FM25V20A is not accessible for a tPU time after power-up.\nUsers must comply with the timing parameter, tPU, which is the\nminimum time from VDD (min) to the first CS  LOW.

They are listed in Table 1 .\nThese opcodes control the func tions performed by the memory.\nWREN - Set Write Enable Latch\nThe FM25V20A will power up with writes disabled. The WREN\ncommand must be issued before any write operation. Sending\nthe WREN opcode allows the user to issue subsequent opcodesfor write operations. These incl ude writing the Status Register\n(WRSR) and writing t he memory (WRITE). \nSending the WREN opcode causes the internal Write Enable\nLatch to be set. A flag bit in the Status Register, called WEL,\nindicates the state of the latch.  WEL = 1 indicates that writes  are\npermitted. Attempting to write the WEL bit in the Status Regist er\nhas no effect on the state of this bit – only the WREN opcode c an\nset this bit. The WEL bit will be automatically cleared on the rising\nedge of CS\n following a WRDI, a WRSR, or a WRITE operation.\nThis prevents further writes to the Status Register or the F-RA M\narray without another WREN command. Figure 7  illustrates the\nWREN command bus configuration.Figure 7.  WREN Bus Configuration\nWRDI - Reset Write Enable Latch\nThe WRDI command disables all write activity by clearing the\nWrite Enable Latch. T he user can verify that  writes are disable d\nby reading the WEL bit in the Status Register and verifying tha t\nWEL is equal to ‘0’.

The Status Registe r is\norganized as follows. (The defa ult value shipped from the facto ry for WEL, BP0, BP1, bits 4–5, W PEN is ‘0’, and  for bit 6 is ‘ 1’).\nBits 0 and 4-5 are fixed at ‘0’ and bit 6 is fixed at ‘1’; none  of these\nbits can be modified. Note that b it 0 ("Ready or Write in progr ess”\nbit in serial flash and EEPROM) is unnecessary, as the F-RAM\nwrites in real-time and is never busy, so it reads out as a ‘0’ . An\nexception to this is when the device is waking up from sleep\nmode, which is described in Sleep Mode on page 10 . The BP1\nand BP0 control the software write-protection features and are\nnonvolatile bits. The WEL flag indicates the state of the Write\nEnable Latch. Attempting to directly write the WEL bit in theStatus Register has no effect on its state. This bit is interna lly set\nand cleared via the WREN and WRDI commands, respectively. \nBP1 and BP0 are memory block write protection bits. They\nspecify portions of m emory that are write-protected as shown in\nTable 4 .\nThe BP1 and BP0 bits and the Write Enable Latch are the only\nmechanisms that protect the memo ry from writes. The remaining\nwrite protection features protect inadvertent changes to the bl ock\nprotect bits. \nThe write protect enable bit (WPEN) in the Status Register\ncontrols the effect of the hardware write protect (WP\n) pin. When\nthe WPEN bit is set to \'0\', the status of the WP  pin is ignored.\nWhen the WPEN bit is set to \'1\', a LOW on the WP  pin inhibits a\nwrite to the Status Register. Thus the Status Register is\nwrite-protected only when WPEN = 1 and WP  = 0. Table 5  summarizes the write protection conditions.\nRDSR - Read Status Register\nThe RDSR command allows the bus master to verify the\ncontents of the Status Register. Reading the status register\nprovides information about the current state of the\nwrite-protection features. Fo llowing the RDSR opcode, the\nFM25V20A will return one byte with the contents of the Status\nRegister. Table 2.

Before issuing a WRSR c ommand, the WP  pin must be HIGH or inactive. Note that on the\nFM25V20A, WP  only prevents writing to the Status Register, not the memory a rray. Before sending the WRSR command, the user\nmust send a WREN command to enable writes. Executing a WRSR com mand is a write operation and therefore, clears the Write\nEnable Latch.\nFigure 9.

No page register is needed andany number of sequential writes may be performed. \nWrite Operation\nAll writes to the memory begin with a WREN opcode with CS\nbeing asserted and deasserted. The next opcode is WRITE. TheWRITE opcode is followed by a three-byte address containingthe 18-bit address (A17-A0) of the first data byte to be writte n into\nthe memory. The upper six bits of the three-byte address are\nignored. Subsequent bytes are data bytes, which are writtensequentially. Addresses are incremented internally as long as\nthe bus master continues to  issue clocks and keeps CS\n LOW. If\nthe last address of 3FFFFh is reached, the counter will roll ov er\nto 00000h. Data is written MSB first. The rising edge of CS  termi-\nnates a write operation. A w rite operation is shown in Figure 11 .\nNote  When a burst write reaches a protected block address, the\nautomatic address incr ement stops and all the subsequent data\nbytes received for  write will be ignored by the device.\nEEPROMs use page buffers to increase their write throughput.\nThis compensates for the technology\'s inherently slow writeoperations. F-RAM memories do not have page buffers because\neach byte is written to the F-RAM array immediately after it is\nclocked in (after the eighth clock). This allows any number ofbytes to be written wit hout page buffer delays.\nNote  If the power is lost in the middle of the write operation, onl y\nthe last completed b yte will be written.Read Operation\nAfter the falling edge of CS , the bus master can issue a READ\nopcode. Following the READ command is a three-byte address\ncontaining the 18-bit address (A17-A0) of the first byte of theread operation. The upper six bits of the address are ignored.After the opcode and address are issued, the device drives out\nthe read data on the next eight clocks. The SI input is ignored\nduring read data bytes. Subsequent bytes are data bytes, whichare read out sequentially. Addresses are incremented internally\nas long as the bus master continues to issue clocks and CS\n is\nLOW. If the last address of 3FF FFh is reached, the counter will\nroll over to 00000h. Data is read MSB first. The rising edge of  CS\nterminates a read operation and tristates the SO pin. A read\noperation is shown in  Figure 12 .\nFast Read Operation\nThe FM25V20A supports a FAST READ opcode (0Bh) that is\nprovided for code compatibility with serial flash devices. The\nFAST READ opcode is followed by a three-byte address\ncontaining the 18-bit address (A17-A0) of the first byte of theread operation and then a dummy byte. The dummy byte inserts\na read latency of 8-clock cycle. The fast read operation is\notherwise the same as an ordinary read operation except that itrequires an additional dummy byte. After receiving opcode,\naddress, and a dummy byte, the FM25V20A starts driving its SO\nline with data bytes, with MSB fi rst, and continues transmittin g\nas long as the device is selected and the clock is available. I n\ncase of bulk read, the internal address counter is incremented\nautomatically, and after the last address 3FFFFh is reached, th e\ncounter rolls over to 00000h. When the device is driving data o n\nits SO line, any transition on its SI line is ignored. The risi ng edge\nof CS\n terminates a fast read operat ion and tristates the SO pin.\nA Fast Read operation is shown in Figure 13 .\nFigure 11.  Memory Write (WREN not shown) Operation\nFigure 12.

Fast Read Operation\nSleep Mode\nA low-power sleep mode is implemented on the FM25V20A device. T he device will enter the low-power state when the SLEEP opcode\nB9h is clocked in and a rising edge of CS  is applied. When in sleep mode,  the SCK and SI pins are ignore d and SO will be HI-Z, but\nthe device continues to monitor the CS  pin. On the next falling edge of CS , the device will return to n ormal operation within tREC time.\nThe SO pin remains in a HI-Z state during the wakeup period. Th e device does not necessarily respond to an opcode within the\nwakeup period. To start the wakeu p procedure, the controller ma y send a “dummy” read, for example, and wait the remaining tREC time.\nFigure 14.  Sleep Mode Operation\nDevice ID\nThe FM25V20A device can be inte rrogated for its manufacturer, p roduct identification, and die re vision. The RDID opcode 9Fh al lows\nthe user to read the manufacture r ID and product ID, both of wh ich are read-only bytes. The JEDEC-assigned manufacturer ID pla ces\nthe Cypress (Ramtron) identifie r in bank 7; therefore, there ar e six bytes of the continuation code 7Fh followed by the single  byte C2h.\nThere are two bytes of product ID, which includes a family code , a density code, a sub code, and the product revision code.~~CS\nSCK\nSO012345670 7 654321 2 02 12 22 32 42 52 62 72 8 2 93 03 1\nDataSI\n~~Opcode\n0000101 XXX X  A17 1 X A16 A3 A1 A2 A018-bit Address\nMSB LSB\nMSB LSBD0D1D2D3D4D5D6D701234567\nXXXXXXXXDummy Byte\nHI-ZX\nCS\nSCK\nSI\nSOHI-Z0 Enters Sleep Mode\nVALID INtSUtREC Recovers from Sleep Mode\n10111 0011 2 3 4 5 6 7 \nTable 6.

Read Device ID\nEndurance\nThe FM25V20A devices are capable of being accessed at least 1014 times, reads or writes. An F-RAM memory operates with a read\nand restore mechanism.  Therefore, an endurance cycle is applied  on a row basis for each access (read or write) to the memory a rray.\nThe F-RAM architecture is based on an array of rows and columns  of 32K rows of 64-bits each. The entire row is internally acce ssed\nonce, whether a single byte or all eight bytes are read or writ ten. Each byte in the row is c ounted only once in an endurance calculation.\nTable 7  shows endurance calculations for  a 64-byte repeating loop, whi ch includes an opcode, a starting address, and a sequential\n64-byte data stream. This causes  each byte to experience one en durance cycle through the loop. F -RAM read and write endurance\nis virtually unlimited ev en at a 40-MHz clock rate.\nTable 7.
