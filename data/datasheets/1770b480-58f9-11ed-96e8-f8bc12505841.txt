Input Reflected Ripple Current Test Setup \nNote: Measure input reflected ripple current with a simulated \nsource inductance of 12µH. The measurement points for \ninput reflected ripple current is showed above. \n \n \nFigure2. Output Ripple and Noise Test Setup  \nNote: Scope measurements should be made using a BNC \nsocket, with a 1µF ceramic capacitor and a 10 µF tantalum \ncapacitor. Position the oscilloscope probe between 51mm and 76mm (2 inch and 3 inch) from the module. \n \nDesign Considerations \nInput filtering \nThe power module should be connected to a low ac-impedance input source. Highly inductive source impedances \ncan affect the stability of the power module. For the test \nconfiguration in Figure1, a 47µF electrolytic capacitor (ESR \n<0.7Ω,5Hz～20MHz), mounted close to the power module \nhelps ensure stability of the unit.  \n Safety Considerations \nThe power module must be installed in compliance with the \nspacing and separation requirements of the end-user’s safety agency standard, i.e., UL60950-1,CAN/CSA-C22.2, No. 60950-1 and EN60950-1:2001(+A11) and IEC60950-1:2005, if the system in which the power module is to be used must \nmeet safety agency requirements. \n \nBasic insulation based on 75 Vdc input is provided between \nthe input and output of the module for the purpose of applying insulation requirements when the input to this DC-\nto-DC converter is identified as TNV-2 or SELV. An additional \nevaluation is needed if the source is other than TNV-2 or SELV. \n \nWhen the input source is SELV circuit, the power module \nmeets SELV (safety extra-low voltage) requirements. If the \ninput source is a hazardous voltage which is greater than 60 \nVdc and less than or equal to 75 Vdc, for the module’s output \nto meet SELV requirements, all of the following must be met: \n\uf06e The input source must be insulated from the ac mains \nby reinforced or double insulation. \n\uf06e The input terminals of the module are not operator \naccessible. \n\uf06e If the metal baseplate is grounded, one Vi pin and one \nVo pin shall also be grounded. \n\uf06e A SELV reliability test is conducted on the system \nwhere the module is used, in combination with the \nmodule, to ensure that under a single fault, hazardous \nvoltage does not appear at the module’s output. \n When installed into a Class II equipment (without grounding), spacing consideration should be given to the end-use installation, as the spacing between the module and mounting surface have not been evaluated. \n \nThe power module has extra-low voltage (ELV) outputs \nwhen all inputs are ELV. \n This power module is not internally fused. To achieve \noptimum safety and system protec tion, an input line fuse is \nhighly recommended. The safety agencies require a normal-blow fuse with 3A maximum rating to be installed in \nthe ungrounded lead. A lower rated fuse can be used based \non the maximum inrush transient energy and maximum input current. \n \n             \n \nDocument No.  S L 6 1 V 9 3 .

This power module is negative logic version. When the REM pin is at logic high the power turns off and turns on at logic low.  \n \nTo turn the power module on and off, the user must supply a \nswitch to control the voltage between the REM pin and -Vin \nterminal (see Figure 3). A logic low is V\nREM = -0.7V to 0.8V. \nThe maximum IREM during logic low is 1mA. The switch \nshould maintain a logic low vo ltage while sinking 1mA.During \nlogic high, the typical maximum V REM voltage is18V. \n \nIf not using the remote on/off feature, short REM pin to -Vin.  \n \nFigure3. Remote On/Off Implementation \n \nOutput Voltage Programming \nOutput voltage trim allows the user to increase the output \nvoltage set point of a module. This is accomplished by \nconnecting an external resistor between the TRIM pin and \nVout- pins. If not using the trim  feature, leave the TRIM pin \nopen. To increase the output voltage, refer to Figure 4. A \ntrim resistor, Rtrimup, connected between the TRIM and \nVout-. The following equation determines the external \nresistor value to obtain an output voltage change from Vo, \nnom to the desired Vo, adj:  \n \n \nFigure4. Circuit Configuration to Increase Output V oltage \n \nProtection Features  \nOver Current Protection \nTo provide protection in an output overload fault condition, \nthe module is equipped with internal current limiting circuitry, and can endure current limiting continuously. \n \nAt the point of current limit inception, the unit enters hiccup \nmode. The unit is configured with the auto-restart function, it \nwill remain in the hiccup mode as long as the over current condition exists; it operates normally once the output current \nis reduced back into its specified range. \n \nOutput Over Voltage Protection \nThe output overvoltage protection consists of circuitry that monitors the voltage on the output terminals. If the output voltage exceeds the overvoltage protection threshold, the converter will clamp the output voltage. \n \nOver Temperature Protection \nTo provide protection under certain fault conditions, the \nmodule is equipped with a thermal shutdown circuit. The \nmodule will shutdown when the Tref temperature exceeds OTP set value, but the thermal shutdown is not intended as \na guarantee that the module will survive when the \ntemperature beyond its rating. The module will \nautomatically restarts after it cools down. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \nDocument No.  S L 6 1 V 9 3 .

It will only begin to \noperate once the input voltage is raised above the undervoltage lockout turn-on threshold. \n \nThermal Considerations \nThe power modules operate in a variety of thermal environments; however, sufficient cooling should be provided to help ensure reliable operation of the unit. Considerations include ambient temperature, airflow, module power dissipation, and the need for increased reliability. A \nreduction in the operating temperature of the module will \nresult in an increase in reliability. \n \nHeat Transfer via Convection \nIncreasing airflow over the module enhances the heat \ntransfer via convection.

Recommended Airflow Direction \n \nSoldering Information  \n(Through-Hole Version) \nThe product is intended for through-hole mounting in a PCB. \nWhen SnPb wave soldering is used, the temperature on the \npins is specified to maximum 260 °C for maximum 10 \nseconds while the lead-free solder pot is 270°C max.  \nMaximum preheat rate of 4° C/s and temperature of max \n150 °C is suggested, when hands soldering care should be taken to avoid direct contact between the hot soldering iron \ntip and the pins for more than a few seconds in order to \nprevent overheating. \n \nA no-clean (NC) flux is recommended to avoid entrapment of cleaning fluids in caviti es inside of the DC/DC power \nmodule. The residues may affect long time reliability and \nisolation voltage. \n \nSoldering Information （Surface \nmounting  Version） \nReflow Soldering Information \nThese power modules are large mass, low thermal \nresistance devices and typically heat up slower than other \nSMT components. It is re commended that the customer \nreview data sheets in order to customize the solder reflow \nprofile for each application board assembly. \nThe following instructions must be observed when SMT \nsoldering these units. Failure to observe these instructions \nmay result in the failure of or cause damage to the modules, \nand can adversely affect long-term reliability. Typically, the eutectic solder melts at 217 ℃ for Pb-free Tref \n \n             \n \nDocument No.  S L 6 1 V 9 3 .

There are several types of SMT reflow technologies currently used in the industry. These surface mount power modules can be \nreliably soldered using natural forced convection, IR \n(radiant infrared), or a combination of convection/IR. For reliable soldering the solder  reflow profile should be \nestablished by accurately measuring the modules pin \nconnector temperatures. \n \nLead-free (Pb-free) solder processes \nFor Pb-free solder processes, a pin temperature (T PIN) in \nexcess of the solder melting temperature (T L, +217 to \n+221°C for Sn/Ag/Cu solder alloys) for more than 30 \nseconds, and a peak temperature of +235°C on all solder \njoints is recommended to ensure a reliable solder joint.  \n \nFor Pb-free solder processes, the product is qualified for \nMSL 3 according to IPC/JEDEC standard J-STD-020C. During reflow, T\nP must not exceed +245°C at any time.  \n \x7f\x7f\x7f \nFigure7.

B (Handling, Packing, Shipping and Use of Moisture/Reflow Sensitive Surface Mount Devices). Moisture barrier bags (MBB) with \ndesiccant are required for max. MSL1 condition. These \nsealed packages should not be broken until time of use. Once the original package is broken, the floor life of the \nproduct at conditions of ≤ 30°C and 60% relative humidity \nvaries according to the MSL rating (see J-STD-033B).The \nshelf life for dry packed SMT packages will be a minimum \nof 12 months from the bag seal date, when stored at the \nfollowing conditions: < 40° C, < 90% relative humidity . \n \nPost Solder Cleaning and Drying Considerations \nPost solder cleaning is usually the final circuit-board assembly process prior to electrical board testing. The \nresult of inadequate cleaning and drying can affect both the \nreliability of a power module and the testability of the finished circuit-board assembly.  \n \nSoldering Information （Through-Hole \nVersion） \nThe product is intended for through-hole mounting in a PCB. \nWhen SnPb wave soldering is used, the temperature on the pins is specified to maximum 260 °C for maximum 10 seconds while the lead-free solder pot is 270°C max. \n \nMaximum preheat rate of 4° C/s and temperature of max \n150°C is suggested. Hands soldering care should be taken \nto avoid direct contact between the hot soldering iron tip \nand the pins for more than a few seconds in order to \nprevent overheating. \n A no-clean (NC) flux is recommended to avoid entrapment \nof cleaning fluids in caviti es inside of the DC/DC power \nmodule.
