Operation beyond the maximum operat-\ning conditions for extended periods may affect product reliability.\nTHERMAL DATA\nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in combina-\ntion. The ADP7156  can be damaged when the junction temperature\nlimits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature does not\nguarantee that TJ is within the specified temperature limits. In appli-\ncations with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the\nmaximum ambient temperature may need to be derated.\nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low printed\ncircuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum ambient tem-\nperature can exceed the maximum limit as long as the junction\ntemperature is within specification limits. The junction temperature\n(TJ) of the device is dependent on the ambient temperature (TA),\nthe power dissipation of the device (PD), and the junction to ambi-\nent thermal resistance of the package ( θJA).\nCalculate the maximum junction temperature (TJ) from the ambient\ntemperature (TA) and power dissipation (PD) using the following\nformula:\nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA)\nJunction to ambient thermal resistance ( θJA) of the package is\nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4-layer board. The\njunction to ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on the\napplication and board layout. In applications where high maximum\npower dissipation exists, close attention to thermal board design isrequired. The value of θJA may vary, depending on PCB material,\nlayout, and environmental conditions. The specified values of θJA\nare based on a 4-layer, 4 in. × 3 in. circuit board. See JESD51-7\nand JESD51-9 for detailed information on the board construction.\nΨJB is the junction to board thermal characterization parameter with\nunits of °C/W. ΨJB of the package is based on modeling and calcu-\nlation using a 4-layer board. JESD51-12, Guidelines for Reporting\nand Using Electronic Package Thermal Information , states that\nthermal characterization parameters are not the same as thermal\nresistances. ΨJB measures the component power flowing through\nmultiple thermal paths rather than a single path as in thermal resist-\nance, θJB. Therefore, ΨJB thermal paths include convection from\nthe top of the package as well as radiation from the package, fac-\ntors that make ΨJB more useful in real-world applications. Maximum\njunction temperature (TJ) is calculated from the board temperature\n(TB) and power dissipation (PD) using the following formula:\nTJ = TB + (PD × ΨJB)\nSee JESD51-8 and JESD51-12 for more detailed information about\nΨJB.\nTHERMAL RESISTANCE\nθJA, θJC, and ΨJB are specified for the worst case conditions, that\nis, a device soldered in a circuit board for surface-mount packages.\nTable 5.

D | 13 of 22The ADP7156  is an ultralow noise, high PSRR linear regulator tar-\ngeting radio frequency (RF) applications. The input voltage range is\n2.3 V to 5.5 V, and it can deliver up to 1.2 A of load current. Typical\nshutdown current consumption is 0.2 µA at room temperature.\nOptimized for use with 10 µF ceramic capacitors, the ADP7156\nprovides excellent transient performance.\nFigure 40. Simplified Internal Block Diagram\nInternally, the ADP7156  consists of a reference, an error amplifier,\nand a P-channel MOSFET pass transistor. The output current is de-\nlivered via the PMOS pass device, which is controlled by the error\namplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference voltage with\nthe feedback voltage from the output and amplifies the difference. If\nthe feedback voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the gate\nof the PMOS device is pulled lower, allowing more current to pass\nand increasing the output voltage. If the feedback voltage is higher\nthan the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled\nhigher, allowing less current to pass and decreasing the output\nvoltage.By heavily filtering the reference voltage, the ADP7156  can achieve\n1.7 nV/ √Hz typical output noise spectral density from 10 kHz to 1\nMHz. Because the error amplifier is always in unity gain, the output\nnoise is independent of the output voltage.\nThe ADP7156  uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT pin\nunder normal operating conditions. When EN is high, VOUT turns\non, and when EN is low, VOUT turns off. For automatic startup, tie\nEN to VIN.\nFigure 41. Simplified ESD Protection Block Diagram\nThe ESD protection devices are shown in the block diagram as\nZener diodes (see Figure 41 ).\nData Sheet ADP7156\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. D | 14 of 22DESIGN TOOLS\nThe ADP7156  is supported by the ADIsimPower™, LTpowerCAD®,\nand LTspice® design tools to produce complete power designs\nand simulations. For more information on design tools, visit the\nADP7156  product page, www.analog.com/adp7156 .\nCAPACITOR SELECTION\nMultilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) combine small size, low\nESR, low ESL, and a wide operating temperature range, making\nthem an ideal choice for bypass capacitors. They are not without\nfaults, however. Depending on the dielectric material, the capaci-\ntance can vary dramatically with temperature, dc bias, and ac signal\nlevel. Therefore, selecting the proper capacitor results in the best\ncircuit performance.\nOutput Capacitor\nThe ADP7156  is designed for operation with ceramic capacitors but\nfunctions with most commonly used capacitors when care is taken\nwith regard to the ESR value. The ESR of the output capacitor\naffects the stability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of 10\nµF capacitance with an ESR of 0.1 Ω or less is recommended\nto ensure the stability of the ADP7156 . Output capacitance also\naffects transient response to changes in load current. Using a larger\nvalue of output capacitance improves the transient response of the\nADP7156  to large changes in load current. Figure 42  shows the\ntransient responses for an output capacitance value of 10 µF.\nFigure 42. Output Transient Response, VOUT = 3.3 V, COUT = 10 µF, Channel 1\n= Load Current, Channel 2 = VOUT\nInput and VREG Capacitor\nConnecting a 10 µF capacitor from VIN to ground reduces the\ncircuit sensitivity to PCB layout, especially when long input traces or\nhigh source impedance are encountered.\nTo maintain the best possible stability and PSRR performance,\nconnect a 1 µF or greater capacitor from VREG to ground.REF Capacitor\nThe REF capacitor, CREF, is necessary to stabilize the reference\namplifier. Connect at 1 µF or greater capacitor between REF and\nground.\nBYP Capacitor\nThe BYP capacitor, CBYP, is necessary to filter the reference buffer.\nA 1 µF capacitor is typically connected between BYP and ground.\nCapacitors as small as 0.1 µF can be used; however, the output\nnoise voltage of the LDO increases as a result.\nIn addition, the BYP capacitor value can be increased to reduce the\nnoise below 1 kHz at the expense of increasing the start-up time\nof the LDO regulator. Very large values of CBYP significantly reduce\nthe noise below 10 Hz. Tantalum capacitors are recommended for\ncapacitors larger than approximately 33 µF because solid tantalum\ncapacitors are less prone to microphonic noise issues. A 1 μF\nceramic capacitor in parallel with the larger tantalum capacitor\nis recommended to ensure good noise performance at higher\nfrequencies.\nFigure 43.

D | 15 of 22Capacitor Properties\nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the ADP7156\nif they meet the minimum capacitance and maximum ESR require-\nments. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of die-\nlectrics, each with different behavior over temperature and applied\nvoltage. Capacitors must have a dielectric adequate to ensure the\nminimum capacitance over the necessary temperature range and\ndc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of\n6.3 V to 50 V are recommended. However, Y5V and Z5U dielectrics\nare not recommended because of their poor temperature and dc\nbias characteristics.\nFigure 45  depicts the capacitance vs. dc bias voltage of a 1206,\n10 µF, 10 V, X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a capacitor\nis strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In\ngeneral, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage rating ex-\nhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the X5R dielectric\nis ~±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range and is not a\nfunction of package or voltage rating.\nFigure 45. Capacitance vs. DC Bias Voltage\nUse Equation 1  to determine the worst case capacitance account-\ning for capacitor variation over temperature, component tolerance,\nand voltage.\nCEFF = CBIAS × (1 − tempco ) × (1 − TOL) (1)\nwhere:\nCEFF is the worst case capacitance.\nCBIAS is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage.\ntempco  is the worst case capacitor temperature coefficient.\nTOL is the worst case component tolerance.\nIn this example, the worst case temperature coefficient (tempco)\nover −40°C to +85°C is assumed to be 15% for an X5R dielectric.\nThe tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed to be 10%, and\nCBIAS is 9.72 µF at 5 V, as shown in Figure 45 .\nSubstituting these values in Equation 1  yields\nCEFF = 9.72 µF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 7.44 µFTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the mini-\nmum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temperature and\ntolerance at the chosen output voltage.\nTo guarantee the performance of the ADP7156 , it is imperative that\nthe effects of dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on the behavior\nof the capacitors be evaluated for each application.\nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT (UVLO)\nThe ADP7156  also incorporates an internal UVLO circuit to disable\nthe output voltage when the input voltage is less than the minimum\ninput voltage rating of the regulator. The upper and lower thresholds\nare internally fixed with 200 mV (typical) of hysteresis.\nFigure 46. Typical UVLO Behavior at Various Temperatures, VOUT = 3.3 V\nFigure 46  shows the typical behavior of the UVLO function. This\nhysteresis prevents on/off oscillations that can occur when caused\nby noise on the input voltage as it passes through the threshold\npoints.\nPROGRAMMABLE PRECISION ENABLE\nThe ADP7156  uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT pin\nunder normal operating conditions. As shown in Figure 47 , when a\nrising voltage on EN crosses the upper threshold, nominally 1.22\nV, VOUT turns on. When a falling voltage on EN crosses the lower\nthreshold, nominally 1.13 V, VOUT turns off. The hysteresis of the\nEN threshold is typically 90 mV.\nThe ADP7156  includes a discharge resistor on each VOUT, VREG,\nREF, and BYP pin. These resistors turn on when the device is\ndisabled, and helps to discharge the associated capacitor very\nquickly.\nData Sheet ADP7156\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev.

Typical EN Precision Threshold vs. Input Voltage (VIN)\nThe upper and lower thresholds are user-programmable and can be\nset higher than the nominal 1.22 V threshold by using two resistors.\nDetermine the resistance values, REN1 and REN2, from\nREN1 = REN2 × (VEN − 1.22 V)/1.22 Vwhere:\nREN2 typically ranges from 10 k Ω to 100 k Ω.\nVEN is the desired turn-on voltage.\nThe hysteresis voltage increases by the factor\n(REN1 + REN2)/REN2\nFor the example shown in Figure 50 , the EN threshold is 2.44 V\nwith a hysteresis of 200 mV.\nFigure 50. Typical EN Pin Voltage Divider\nFigure 50  shows the typical voltage divider configuration of the EN\npin. This configuration prevents on/off oscillations that can occur\ndue to noise on the EN pin as it passes through the threshold\npoints.\nSTART-UP TIME\nThe ADP7156  uses an internal soft start to limit the inrush current\nwhen the output is enabled. The start-up time for a 3.3 V output\nis approximately 1.2 ms from the time the EN active threshold is\ncrossed to when the output reaches 90% of its final value.\nThe rise time in seconds of the output voltage (10% to 90%) is\napproximately\n0.0012 × CBYP\nwhere CBYP is measured in microfarads.\nFigure 51. Typical Start-Up Behavior with CBYP = 1 µF to 10 µF\nData Sheet ADP7156\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. D | 17 of 22Figure 52. Typical Start-Up Behavior with CBYP = 10 µF to 100 µF\nREF, BYP, AND VREG PINS\nREF, BYP, and VREG generate voltages internally (VREF, VBYP, and\nVREG) that require external bypass capacitors for proper operation.\nDo not, under any circumstances, connect any loads to these pins,\nbecause doing so compromises the noise and PSRR performance\nof the ADP7156 . Using larger values of CBYP, CREF, and CREG is\nacceptable but can increase the start-up time, as described in the\nStart-Up Time  section.\nCURRENT-LIMIT AND THERMAL SHUTDOWN\nThe ADP7156  is protected against damage due to excessive power\ndissipation by current and thermal overload protection circuits. The\nADP7156  is designed to current limit when the output load reaches\n1.8 A (typical). When the output load exceeds 1.8 A, the output\nvoltage is reduced to maintain a constant current limit.\nWhen the ADP7156  junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the ther-\nmal shutdown circuit turns off the output voltage, reducing the\noutput current to zero. Extreme junction temperature can be the\nresult of high current operation, poor circuit board design or high\nambient temperature. A 15°C hysteresis is included so that the\nADP7156  does not return to operation after thermal shutdown until\nthe on-chip temperature falls below 135°C. When the device exits\nthermal shutdown, a soft start is initiated to reduce the inrush\ncurrent.\nCurrent-limit and thermal shutdown protections are intended to pro-\ntect the device against accidental overload conditions. For example,\na hard short from VOUT to ground or an extremely long soft start\ntimer usually causes thermal oscillations between the current limit\nand thermal shutdown.\nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS\nIn applications with a low input to output voltage differential, the\nADP7156  does not dissipate much heat. However, in applications\nwith high ambient temperature and/or high input voltage, the heat\ndissipated in the package may become large enough that it causesthe junction temperature of the die to exceed the maximum junction\ntemperature of 125°C.\nThe junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient\ntemperature of the environment and the temperature rise of the\npackage due to the power dissipation, as shown in Equation 2 .\nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the\nADP7156  must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the junction\ntemperature stays below this maximum value, the user must be\naware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature\nchanges. These parameters include ambient temperature, power\ndissipation in the power device, and thermal resistances between\nthe junction and ambient air ( θJA). The θJA number is dependent on\nthe package assembly compounds that are used and the amount of\ncopper used to solder the exposed pad (ground) to the PCB.\nTable 7  shows the typical θJA values of the 8-lead SOIC and\n10 ‑lead LFCSP packages for various PCB copper sizes. Table\n8 shows the typical ΨJB values of the 8-lead SOIC and 10-lead\nLFCSP.\nTable 7.

Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies\nto the following:\nTJ = TA + (((VIN − VOUT) × ILOAD) × θJA) (4)\nData Sheet ADP7156\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. D | 18 of 22As shown in Equation 4 , for a given ambient temperature, input to\noutput voltage differential, and continuous load current, a minimum\ncopper size requirement exists for the PCB to ensure that the\njunction temperature does not rise above 125°C.\nThe heat dissipation from the package can be improved by increas-\ning the amount of copper attached to the pins and exposed pad of\nthe ADP7156 . Adding thermal planes underneath the package also\nimproves thermal performance. However, as shown in Table 7 , a\npoint of diminishing returns is eventually reached, beyond which an\nincrease in the copper area does not yield significant reduction in\nthe junction to ambient thermal resistance.\nFigure 53  to Figure 58  show junction temperature calculations for\nvarious ambient temperatures, power dissipation, and areas of PCB\ncopper.\nFigure 53.
