These miniature, high-precision,\nlow quiescent current amplifiers offer high input impedance\nand rail-to-rail output swing. Single or dual supplies as low as\n+2.7V (±1.35V) and up to +5.5V ( ±2.75V) may be used.\nThese op amps are optimized for low-voltage, single-supply\noperation.\nThe OPA334 family includes a shutdown mode. Under logic\ncontrol, the amplifiers can be switched from normal operation\nto a standby current of 2 µA. When the Enable pin is con-\nnected high, the amplifier is active. Connecting Enable low\ndisables the amplifier, and places the output in a high-\nimpedance state.\nThe OPA334 (single version with shutdown) comes in\nMicroSIZE SOT23-6. The OPA335 (single version without\nshutdown) is available in SOT23-5, and SO-8. The OPA2334\n(dual version with shutdown) comes in MicroSIZE MSOP-10.\nThe OPA2335 (dual version without shutdown) is offered in\nthe MSOP-8 and SO-8 packages.

Theyuse auto-zeroing techniques to provide low offset voltageand very low drift over time and temperature.\nGood layout practice mandates use of a 0.1 µF capacitor\nplaced closely across the supply pins.\nFor lowest offset voltage and precision performance, circuit\nlayout and mechanical conditions should be optimized. Avoidtemperature gradients that create thermoelectric (Seebeck)effects in thermocouple junctions formed from connectingdissimilar conductors. These thermally-generated potentialscan be made to cancel by assuring that they are equal onboth input terminals.\n•Use low thermoelectric-coefficient connections (avoid dis-\nsimilar metals).\n•Thermally isolate components from power supplies or\nother heat-sources.\n•Shield op amp and input circuitry from air currents, such as\ncooling fans.\nFollowing these guidelines will reduce the likelihood of junc-\ntions being at different temperatures, which can cause ther-moelectric voltages of 0.1 µV/°C or higher, depending on\nmaterials used.\nOPERATING VOLTAGE\nThe OPA334 and OPA335 series op amps operate over apower-supply range of +2.7V to +5.5V ( ±1.35V to ±2.75V).\nSupply voltages higher than 7V (absolute maximum) canpermanently damage the amplifier. Parameters that varyover supply voltage or temperature are shown in the TypicalCharacteristics section of this data sheet.OPA334 ENABLE FUNCTION\nThe enable/shutdown digital input is referenced to the V –\nsupply voltage of the amp. A logic high enables the op amp. Avalid logic high is defined as > 75% of the total supply voltage.The valid logic high signal can be up to 5.5V above the negativesupply, independent of the positive supply voltage. A validlogic low is defined as < 0.8V above the V – supply pin. If dual\nor split power supplies are used, be sure that logic input signalsare properly referred to the negative supply voltage. TheEnable pin must be connected to a valid high or low voltage, ordriven, not left open circuit.\nThe logic input is a high-impedance CMOS input, with sepa-\nrate logic inputs provided on the dual version. For battery-operated applications, this feature can be used to greatlyreduce the average current and extend battery life.\nThe enable time is 150 µs, which includes one full auto-zero\ncycle required by the amplifier to return to V\nOS accuracy.\nPrior to this time, the amplifier functions properly, but withunspecified offset voltage.\nDisable time is 1 µs. When disabled, the output assumes a\nhigh-impedance state. This allows the OPA334 to be oper-ated as a gated amplifier, or to have the output multiplexedonto a common analog output bus.\nINPUT VOLTAGE\nThe input common-mode range extends from (V –) – 0.1V to\n(V+) – 1.5V. For normal operation, the inputs must be limited\nto this range. The common-mode rejection ratio is only validwithin the valid input common-mode range. A lower supplyvoltage results in lower input common-mode range; there-fore, attention to these values must be given when selectingthe input bias voltage. For example, when operating on asingle 3V power supply, common-mode range is from 0.1Vbelow ground to half the power-supply voltage.COMMON-MODE RANGE vs SUPPLY VOLTAGECommon-Mode Range (V)\n2.74.5\n4.03.53.02.52.01.51.00.5\n0\n–0.5\n3.7 3.2 5.2 5.5\nSupply Voltage (V)4.7 4.2\nMinimum Common-ModeMaximum Common-ModeSETTLING TIME vs CLOSED-LOOP GAINSettling Time ( µs)\n1100\n10\n1\n10\nGain (V/V)1000.1%0.01%Unity-gain\nrequires onecomplete Auto-ZeroCycle—see text.\n8\nwww.ti.comOPA334, OPA2334, OPA335, OPA2335\nSBOS245DFIGURE 1. Input Current Protection.5kΩOPA33510mA max+5V\nVINVOUTIOVERLOADCurrent-limiting resistor \nrequired if input voltage exceeds supply rails by≥ 0.5V.Normally, input bias current is approximately 70pA; however,\ninput voltages exceeding the power supplies can causeexcessive current to flow in or out of the input pins. Momen-tary voltages greater than the power supply can be toleratedif the input current is limited to 10mA. This is easily accom-plished with an input resistor, as shown in Figure 1.\nINTERNAL OFFSET CORRECTION\nThe OPA334 and OPA335 series op amps use an auto-zero\ntopology with a time-continuous 2MHz op amp in the signalpath. This amplifier is zero-corrected every 100 µs using a\nproprietary technique. Upon power-up, the amplifier requiresone full auto-zero cycle of approximately 100 µs to achieve\nspecified V\nOS accuracy. Prior to this time, the amplifier\nfunctions properly but with unspecified offset voltage.\nThis design has remarkably little aliasing and noise. Zero\ncorrection occurs at a 10kHz rate, but there is virtually nofundamental noise energy present at that frequency. For allpractical purposes, any glitches have energy at 20MHz orhigher and are easily filtered, if required. Most applicationsare not sensitive to such high-frequency noise, and nofiltering is required.\nUnity-gain operation demands that the auto-zero circuitry\ncorrect for common-mode rejection errors of the main ampli-fier. Because these errors can be larger than 0.01% of a full-scale input step change, one calibration cycle (100 µs) can be\nrequired to achieve full accuracy. This behavior is shown inthe typical characteristic section, see \nSettling Time vs Closed-\nLoop Gain .\nACHIEVING OUTPUT SWING TO THE OP AMP ’S\nNEGATIVE RAIL\nSome applications require output voltage swing from 0V to a\npositive full-scale voltage (such as +2.5V) with excellentaccuracy. With most single-supply op amps, problems arisewhen the output signal approaches 0V, near the lower outputFIGURE 2. Op Amp with Pull-Down Resistor to Achieve\nVOUT = Ground.swing limit of a single-supply op amp. A good single-supply\nop amp may swing close to single-supply ground, but will notreach ground. The output of the OPA334 or OPA335 can bemade to swing to ground, or slightly below, on a single-supply power source. To do so requires use of anotherresistor and an additional, more negative, power supply thanthe op amp ’s negative supply. A pull-down resistor may be\nconnected between the output and the additional negativesupply to pull the output down below the value that the outputwould otherwise achieve, as shown in Figure 2.\nThe OPA334 and OPA335 have an output stage that allows\nthe output voltage to be pulled to its negative supply rail, orslightly below using the above technique. This technique onlyworks with some types of output stages. The OPA334 andOPA335 have been characterized to perform well with thistechnique. Accuracy is excellent down to 0V and as low as–2mV. Limiting and non-linearity occurs below –2mV, but\nexcellent accuracy returns as the output is again drivenabove –2mV. Lowering the resistance of the pull-down resis-\ntor will allow the op amp to swing even further below thenegative rail. Resistances as low as 10k Ω can be used to\nachieve excellent accuracy down to –10mV.\nLAYOUT GUIDELINES\nAttention to good layout practices is always recommended.\nKeep traces short. When possible, use a PCB ground planewith surface-mount components placed as close to the de-vice pins as possible. Place a 0.1 µF capacitor closely across\nthe supply pins. These guidelines should be applied through-out the analog circuit to improve performance and providebenefits such as reducing the EMI (electromagnetic-interfer-ence) susceptibility.VOUT\nRP = 40kΩ\nOp Amp’s V– = GndOPA335\nVINV+ = +5V\n–5V\nAdditional\nNegative\nSupply\n9\nwww.ti.comOPA334, OPA2334, OPA335, OPA2335\nSBOS245DFIGURE 3.

Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.\nPREVIEW:  Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.\nOBSOLETE:  TI has discontinued the production of the device.\n \nAddendum-Page 1\nPACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM\nwww.ti.com 14-Oct-2022\n(2) RoHS:  TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances,  including the requirement that RoHS substance\ndo not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may\nreference these types of products as "Pb-Free".\nRoHS Exempt:  TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.\nGreen: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (Cl) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold.  Antimony trioxide based\nflame retardants must also meet the <=1000ppm threshold requirement.\n \n(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.\n \n(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.\n \n(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation\nof the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.\n \n(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two\nlines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.\n \nImportant Information and Disclaimer: The information provided on this page represents TI\'s knowledge and belief as of the date that it is provided.
