The HMC531LP5 & HMC531LP5E integrate resona-tors, negative resistance devices, varactor diodes and feature half frequency and divide-by-4 outputs. The VCO’s phase noise performance is excellent over temperature, shock, and process due to the oscillator’s monolithic structure. Power output is +7 dBm typical from a +5V supply voltage. The prescaler function can be disabled to conserve current if not required. The voltage controlled oscillator is packaged in a leadless QFN 5x5 mm surface mount package, and requires no external matching components.Dual Output: Fo = 13.6 - 14.9 GHz\n        Fo\n/2 = 6.8 - 7.45 GHz\nPout: +7 dBm\nPhase Noise: -110 dBc/Hz @100 kHz Typ.No External Resonator Needed32 Lead 5x5mm SMT Package: 25mm²Typical Applications\nLow noise MMIC VCO w/Half Frequency, Divide-by-4 \nOutputs for:\n• VSAT Radio• Point to Point/Multipoint Radio• Test Equipment & Industrial Controls• Military End-Use\nElectrical Specifications,  TA = +25° C, Vcc1, Vcc2 = +5V\nParameter Min.
