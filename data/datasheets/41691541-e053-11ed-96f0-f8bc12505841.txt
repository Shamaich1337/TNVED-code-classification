This unique  \ncombination makes the produc t perfectly suited for all  \napplications with outstanding requirements towards size,  \nreliable precision and stability.FEATURES\n• Low temperature coef ficients and tight  \ntolerances\n• Sulfur resistance ve rified according to  \nASTM B 809\n• Superior moisture resistivity (85 °C; 85 % RH)• Excellent overall stability at different  \nenvironmental conditions, e.g. \uf0a3 0.05 % (1000 h rated  \npower at 70 °C)\n• AEC-Q200 qualified• Material categorization: fo r definitions of compliance  \nplease see www.vishay.com/doc?99912\nAPPLICATIONS\n• Automotive• Industrial equipment• Test and measuring equipment• Medical equipment• Telecommunication• Instrumentation\nNote\n(1)Please refer to APPLICATION INFORMATION, see below\nAPPLICATION INFORMATION\nWhen the resistor dissipates power, a te mperature rise above the ambient tempera ture occurs, depend ent on the thermal  \nresistance of the assembled resi stor together with the printed circuit board. The ra ted dissipation applie s only if the permitt ed \nfilm temperature is not exceeded.Please consider the application note “Thermal Mana gement in Surface-Mounte d Resistor Applications”  \n(www.vishay.com/doc?28844\n) for information on the general nature of thermal resistance.\nThese resistors do not feature a limited lifetime when operated  within the permissibl e limits. However, re sistance value drift  \nincreasing over operating time may result in exceeding a limit acceptable to the specific application, thereby establishing a  \nfunctional lifetime. \nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nDESCRIPTION TNPU0402 e3 TNPU0603 e3 TNPU0805 e3 TNPU1206 e3Imperial size 0402 0603 0805 1206Metric size code RR1005M RR1608M RR2012M RR3216MResistance range 100 \uf057 to 100 k \uf057 100 \uf057 to 100 k \uf057 100 \uf057 to 332 k \uf057 100 \uf057 to 511 k \uf057\nResistance tolerance ± 0.1 %; ± 0.05 % ± 0.1 %; ± 0.05 %; ± 0.02 %Temperature coefficient ± 10 ppm/K; ± 5 ppm/K ± 10 ppm/K; ± 5 ppm/K; ± 2 ppm/K\nRated dissipation, P\n70 (1)0.063 W 0.1 W 0.125 W 0.25 W\nOperating voltage, Umax.

A  \nhomogeneous film of metal al loy is deposited on a high  \ngrade ceramic substrate (Al 2O3) and conditioned to achieve  \nthe desired temperature coe fficient. Specially designed  \ninner contacts are deposited on  both sides. A special laser  \nis used to achieve the target value by smoothly fine trimming  \nthe resistive layer without dama ging the ceramics. A further  \nconditioning is applied in order to stabilize the trimming  \nresult. The resistor elements  are covered by a protective  \ncoating designed for electrical, mechanical and climatic  \nprotection. The terminations rece ive a final pure matte tin on  \nnickel plating. The result of the determined production is  \nverified by an extensive test ing procedure on 100 % of the  \nindividual chip resistors. Only accepted products are laid  \ndirectly into the tape in accordance with IEC 60286-3 Type  \n1a (1).\nASSEMBLY\nThe resistors are suitable for processing on automatic  \nSMD assembly systems. They are suitable for automatic  \nsoldering using wave, reflow or vapor phase as shown in  \nIEC 61760-1 (1). The encapsulation is resistant to all  \ncleaning solvents commonly used in the electronics  \nindustry, including alcohols, esters and aqueous solutions.  \nThe suitability of conformal coatings, potting compounds  \nand their processes, if app lied, shall be qualified by  \nappropriate means to ensure th e long-term stability of the  \nwhole system.The resistors are RoHS compliant , the pure matte tin plating  \nprovides compatibility with  lead (Pb)-free and  \nlead-containing soldering proc esses. The immunity of the  \nplating against tin whisker gr owth has been proven under  \nextensive testing.MATERIALS\nVishay acknowledges the following systems for the  \nregulation of hazardous substances:• IEC 62474, Material Declaration for Products of and for the  \nElectrotechnical Industry, with the list of declarable  \nsubstances given therein \n(2)\n• The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List  \n(GADSL) (3)\n• The REACH regulation (1907/2006/EC) and the related list  \nof substances with very high concern (SVHC) (4) for its  \nsupply chain\nThe products do not contain any of the banned substances  \nas per IEC 62474, GADSL, or the SVHC list, see  \nwww.vishay.com/how/leadfree .\nHence the products fully comply with the following  \ndirectives:• 2000/53/EC End-of-Life Vehicle Directive (ELV) and  \nAnnex II (ELV II)\n• 2011/65/EU Restriction of the Use of Hazardous  \nSubstances Directive (RoHS) with amendment  \n2015/863/EU\n• 2012/19/EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment  \nDirective (WEEE)\nVishay pursues the elimination of conflict minerals from its  \nsupply chain, see the Conflict Minerals Policy at  \nwww.vishay.com/doc?49037\n.\nRELATED PRODUCTS\nFor products with precision sp ecification see the datasheet:\n• TNPW e3 - High Stability Thin Film Flat Chip Resistors \uf020\n(www.vishay.com/doc?28758 )\nNotes\n(1)The quoted IEC standards are also released as EN standards with the same number and identical contents\n(2)The IEC 62474 list of declarable subs tances is maintained in  a dedicated database, which is available at http://std.iec.ch/iec62474\n(3)The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL) is maintained by the American Chemistry Council and available at www.gadsl.org\n(4)The SVHC list is maintained by the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) and available at http://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table\nTNPU e3\nwww.vishay.comVishay Draloric   \n \nRevision: 09-Jan-2020 5 Document Number: 28779\nFor technical questions, contact: thinfilmchip@vishay.com\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.
