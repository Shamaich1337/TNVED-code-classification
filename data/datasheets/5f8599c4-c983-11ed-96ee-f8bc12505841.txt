These\ndevices contain output current limiting, safe operating area\ncompensation and thermal shutdown protection making\nthem designer friendly for powering numerous consumerand industrial products. The NCP1117 series is pincompatible with the older LM317 and its derivative devicetypes.\nOutput Voltage\nThe typical application circuits for the fixed and\nadjustable output regulators are shown in Figures 23 and 24.\nThe adjustable devices are floating voltage regulators. Theydevelop and maintain the nominal 1.25 V reference voltage\nbetween the output and adjust pins. The reference voltage is\nprogrammed to a constant current source by resistor R1, and\nthis current flows through R2 to ground to set the output\nvoltage. The programmed current level is usually selected to\nbe greater than the specified 5.0 mA minimum that isrequired for regulation. Since the adjust pin current, I\nadj, is\nsignificantly lower and constant with respect to theprogrammed load current, it generates a small outputvoltage error that can usually be ignored. For the fixedoutput devices R1 and R2 are included within the device and\nthe ground current I\ngnd, ranges from 3.0 mA to 5.0 mA\ndepending upon the output voltage.\nExternal Capacitors\nInput bypass capacitor C in may be required for regulator\nstability if the device is located more than a few inches from\nthe power source. This capacitor will reduce the circuit’s\nsensitivity when powered from a complex source impedance\nand significantly enhance the output transient response. Theinput bypass capacitor should be mounted with the shortest\npossible track length directly across the regulator’s input\nand ground terminals. A 10 /C0109F ceramic or tantalum\ncapacitor should be adequate for most applications.\nFigure 23. Fixed Output Regulator12Output3InputNCP1117\nXTXX++\nCout Cin\nIgndFrequency compensation for the regulator is provided by\ncapacitor C out and its use is mandatory to ensure output\nstability. A minimum capacitance value of 4.7 /C0109F with an\nequivalent series resistance (ESR) that is within the limits of\n33 m/C0087 (typ) to 2.2 /C0087 is required. See Figures 12 and 13. The\ncapacitor type can be ceramic, tantalum, or aluminumelectrolytic as long as it meets the minimum capacitancevalue and ESR limits over the circuit’s entire operatingtemperature range. Higher values of output capacitance can\nbe used to enhance loop stability and transient response withthe additional benefit of reducing output noise.\nFigure 24.

For example, with a 12 V\nregulator, the output ripple will increase by 12 V/1.25 V or9.6 and the ripple rejection will decrease by 20 log of thisratio or 19.6 dB. The loss of ripple rejection can be restored\nto the values shown with the addition of bypass capacitorC\nadj, shown in Figure 24. The reactance of C adj at the ripple\nfrequency must be less than the resistance of R1. The value\nof R1 can be selected to provide the minimum required load\ncurrent to maintain regulation and is usually in the range of\n100 /C0087 to 200 /C0087.\nCadj/C01171\n2/C0112fripple R1\nThe minimum required capacitance can be calculated\nfrom the above formula. When using the device in anapplication that is powered from the AC line via a\ntransformer and a full wave bridge, the value for C\nadj is:\nfripple/C0043120 Hz, R1 /C0043120/C0087, then C adj/C011711.1/C0109F\nThe value for C adj is significantly reduced in applications\nwhere the input ripple frequency is high. If used as a post\nregulator in a switching converter under the following\nconditions:\nfripple/C004350 kHz, R1 /C0043120/C0087, then C adj/C01170.027 /C0109F\nFigures 10 and 11 shows the level of ripple rejection that\nis obtainable with the adjust pin properly bypassed.\nNCP1117, NCP1117I, NCV1117\nwww. onsemi.com\n10Protection Diodes\nThe NCP1117 family has two internal low impedance\ndiode paths that normally do not require protection whenused in the typical regulator applications. The first pathconnects between V\nout and V in, and it can withstand a peak\nsurge current of about 15 A. Normal cycling of V in cannot\ngenerate a current surge of this magnitude. Only when V in\nis shorted or crowbarred to ground and C out is greater than\n50 /C0109F, it becomes possible for device damage to occur.\nUnder these conditions, diode D1 is required to protect thedevice. The second path connects between C\nadj and V out, and\nit can withstand a peak surge current of about 150 mA.Protection diode D2 is required if the output is shorted or\ncrowbarred to ground and C\nadj is greater than 1.0 /C0109F.\nFigure 25. Protection Diode Placement12Output3InputNCP1117\nXTA++Cout Cin\nR2+CadjR11N4001D1\nD2\n1N4001\nA combination of protection diodes D1 and D2 may be\nrequired in the event that V in is shorted to ground and C adj\nis greater than 50 /C0109F. The peak current capability stated for\nthe internal diodes are for a time of 100 /C0109s with a junction\ntemperature of 25 °C. These values may vary and are to be\nused as a general guide.\nLoad Regulation\nThe NCP1117 series is capable of providing excellent\nload regulation; but since these are three terminal devices,\nonly partial remote load sensing is possible. There are twoconditions that must be met to achieve the maximumavailable load regulation performance. The first is that thetop side of programming resistor R1 should be connected asclose to the regulator case as practicable. This will minimize\nthe voltage drop caused by wiring resistance RW + fromappearing in series with reference voltage that is across R1.The second condition is that the ground end of R2 should be\nconnected directly to the load. This allows true Kelvinsensing where the regulator compensates for the voltage\ndrop caused by wiring resistance RW −.\nFigure 26. Load Sensing12Output3InputNCP1117\nXTA\n++Cout\nCinR1Remote\nLoadRW+\nRW−R2\nThermal Considerations\nThis series contains an internal thermal limiting circuit\nthat is designed to protect the regulator in the event that themaximum junction temperature is exceeded. Whenactivated, typically at 175 °C, the regulator output switches\noff and then back on as the die cools. As a result, if the deviceis continuously operated in an overheated condition, theoutput will appear to be oscillating. This feature providesprotection from a catastrophic device failure due to\naccidental overheating. It is not intended to be used as a\nsubstitute for proper heatsinking. The maximum devicepower dissipation can be calculated by:\nPD/C0043TJ(max) /C0042TA\nR/C0113JA\nThe devices are available in surface mount SOT −223 and\nDPAK packages. Each package has an exposed metal tab\nthat is specifically designed to reduce the junction to air\nthermal resistance, R /C0113JA, by utilizing the printed circuit\nboard copper as a heat dissipater. Figures 21 and 22 show\ntypical R /C0113JA values that can be obtained from a square\npattern using economical single sided 2.0 ounce copperboard material. The final product thermal limits should betested and quantified in order to insure acceptable\nperformance and reliability. The actual R\n/C0113JA can vary\nconsiderably from the graphs shown. This will be due to any\nchanges made in the copper aspect ratio of the final layout,adjacent heat sources, and air flow.\nNCP1117, NCP1117I, NCV1117\nwww. onsemi.com\n11Figure 27.
