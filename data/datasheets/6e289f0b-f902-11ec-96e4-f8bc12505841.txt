The products are capable of operation and storage over the full military temperature range and can be purchased as either commercial product or with full MIL-PRF-38534 Class Level H or K testing or from the appropriate DLA Standard Microcircuit Drawing (SMD). All devices are manufactured and tested on a MIL-PRF-38534 certified line, and Class H and K devices are included in the DLA Qualified Manufacturers List QML-38534 for Hybrid Microcircuits.\nEach channel contains a GaAsP light emitting diode that is \noptically coupled to an integrated high gain photon detector. The high gain output stage features an open collector output, providing both lower saturation voltage and higher signaling speed than possible with conventional photo-Darlington optocouplers. The shallow depth and small junctions offered by the IC process provides better radiation immunity than conventional photo transistor optocouplers.\nThe supply voltage can be operated as low as 2.0V without \nadversely affecting the parametric performance.\nThese devices have a 300% minimum CTR at an input current \nof only 0.5 mA making them ideal for use in low input current applications such as MOS, CMOS , low power logic interfaces or \nline receivers. Compatibility with high-voltage CMOS logic systems is assured by specifying I\nCCH and IOH at 18 Volts.\nCAUTION It is advised that normal static precautions be \ntaken in handling and assembly of this component to prevent damage and/or degradation which may be induced by ESD.\n1.
