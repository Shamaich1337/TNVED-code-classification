Low Distortion Rail-to-Rail Output Swing \n \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8051 (single), AD8052 (dual), and AD8054 (quad) are \nlow cost, high speed, voltage feedback amplifiers. The amplifiers \noperate on +3 V , +5 V , or ±5 V supplies at low supply current. \nThey have true single-supply capability with an input voltage range extending 200 mV below the negative rail and within 1 V \nof the positive rail. \nDespite their low cost, the AD8051/ AD8052 /AD8054 provide \nexcellent overall performance and versatility. The output voltage \nswings to within 25 mV of each rail, providing maximum output dynamic range with excellent overdrive recovery. The AD8051 /AD8052/ AD8054 are well suited for video \nelectronics, cameras, video switchers, or any high speed portable \nequipment. Low distortion and fast settling make them ideal for \nactive filter applications. \nThe AD8051 /AD8052 in the 8-lead SOIC, the AD8052 in the \nMSOP , the AD8054 in the 14-lead SOIC, and the 14-lead TSSOP \npackages are available in the extended temperature range of \n−40°C to +125°C. \n \nAD8051/ AD8052/ AD8054 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Exceeding a junction temperature of 175°C for \nan extended period can result in device failure. \nWhile the AD8051/ AD8052 /AD8054 are internally short-\ncircuit protected, this cannot be sufficient to guarantee that the \nmaximum junction temperature (150°C) is not exceeded under \nall conditions. To ensure proper operation, it is necessary to \nobserve the maximum power derating curves. \nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE (°C)–5502.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n5MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)2.5\nMSOP-8SOIC-8\nSOT-23-5SOIC-14\nTSSOP-14\n–35 –15 15 35 55 75 95 115\n01062-006 \nFigure 6.

K | Page 16 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8051 /AD8052/ AD8054 are fabricated on the Analog \nDevices, Inc. proprietary eXtra-Fast Complementary Bipolar \n(XFCB) process, which enables the construction of PNP and NPN transistors with similar fTs in the 2 GHz to 4 GHz region. \nThe process is dielectrically isolated to eliminate the parasitic \nand latch-up problems caused by junction isolation. These features allow the construction of high frequency, low distortion amplifiers with low supply currents. This design uses a differential output input stage to maximize bandwidth and headroom (see Figure 40). The smaller signal swings required on the first stage \noutputs (nodes SIP , SIN) reduce the effect of nonlinear currents \ndue to junction capacitances and improve the distortion per-formance. This design achieves harmonic distortion of −80 dBc @ 1 MHz into 100 Ω with V\nOUT = 2 V p-p (gain = +1) on a \nsingle 5 V supply. The inputs of the device can handle voltages from −0.2 V below the negative rail to within 1 V of the positive rail. Exceeding these values do not cause phase reversal; however, the input ESD devices begin to conduct if the input voltages exceed the \nrails by greater than 0.5 V . During this overdrive condition, the \noutput stays at the rail. \nThe rail-to-rail output range of the AD8051 /AD8052/ AD8054 \nis provided by a complementary common emitter output stage. \nHigh output drive capability is provided by injecting all output stage predriver currents directly into the bases of the output devices Q8 and Q36. Biasing of Q8 and Q36 is accomplished by \nI8 and I5, along with a common-mode feedback loop (not \nshown). This circuit topology allows the AD8051 /AD8052 to \ndrive 45 mA of output current and allows the AD8054 to drive \n30 mA of output current with the outputs within 0.5 V of the \nsupply rails. \n \nI10R39\nVEEI2 I3Q25\nQ51\nR23 R27I9\nQ36\nI5\nVEE\nC3\nC9\nI8\nVCCI11\nI7 R3 R21 R5Q3SIP SIN\nC7Q4\nR15 R2R26Q50\nQ22\nQ21 Q27Q7\nQ8Q23\nQ31Q39\nQ13 Q1\nQ24 Q47Q11 Q2Q5\nQ40\nVOUTVCC\nVINP\nVINN\nVEE\n01062-045 \nFigure 40.

K | Page 17 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nOVERDRIVE RECOVERY \nOverdrive of an amplifier occurs when the output and/or input \nrange is exceeded. The amplifier must recover from this over-\ndrive condition. As shown in Figure 41, the AD8051/ AD8052 / \nAD8054 recover within 60 ns from negative overdrive and within 45 ns from positive overdrive. \nVOLTSVS = ±5V\nG = +5\nRF = 2kΩ\nRL = 2kΩ\nV/DIV AS SHOWN 100nsINPUT 1V/DIV\nOUTPUT 2V/DIV\n01062-040 \nFigure 41. Overdrive Recovery \nDRIVING CAPACITIVE LOADS \nConsider the AD8051/ AD8052 in a closed-loop gain of +1 with \n+V S = 5 V and a load of 2 kΩ in parallel with 50 pF. Figure 42 \nand Figure 43 show their frequency and time domain responses, \nrespectively, to a small-signal excitation. The capacitive load \ndrive of the AD8051/ AD8052 /AD8054 can be increased by \nadding a low value resistor in series with the load. Figure 44  and Figure 45 show the effect of a series resistor on the capaci-tive drive for varying voltage gains. As the closed-loop gain is \nincreased, the larger phase margin allows for larger capacitive \nloads with less peaking. Adding a series resistor with lower closed-loop gains accomplishes the same effect. For large capacitive loads, the frequency response of the amplifier is  dominated by the roll-off of the series resistor and the load \ncapacitance. \nFREQUENCY (MHz)8\n64\n20\n–2–4\n–6\n–8\n–10GAIN (dB)\n–12\n0.1 500 100 11 0\n01062-041VS = 5V\nG = +1\nRL = 2kΩ\nCL = 50pF\nVOUT = 200mV p-p\n \nFigure 42.

K | Page 18 of 24 LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS \nThe specified high speed performance of the AD8051/ AD8052/ \nAD8054 requires careful attention to board layout and component \nselection. Proper RF design techniques and low parasitic \ncomponent selection are necessary. \nThe PCB should have a ground plane covering all unused \nportions of the component side of the board to provide a low \nimpedance path. The ground plane should be removed from the \narea near the input pins to reduce parasitic capacitance. \nChip capacitors should be used for supply bypassing. One end \nshould be connected to the ground plane and the other within 3 mm of each power pin. An additional large (4.7 μF to 10 μF) tantalum electrolytic capacitor should be connected in parallel, but not necessarily so close, to supply current for fast, large signal changes at the output. \nThe feedback resistor should be located close to the inverting \ninput pin to keep the parasitic capacitance at this node to a \nminimum. Parasitic capacitance of less than 1 pF at the inverting \ninput can significantly affect high speed performance. \nStripline design techniques should be used for long signal traces \n(greater than about 25 mm). These should be designed with a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω or 75 Ω and be properly \nterminated at each end. \nACTIVE FILTERS \nActive filters at higher frequencies require wider bandwidth op \namps to work effectively. Excessive phase shift produced by \nlower frequency op amps can significantly affect active filter \nperformance. \nFigure 46 shows an example of a 2 MHz biquad bandwidth filter \nthat uses three op amps of an AD8054. Such circuits are \nsometimes used in medical ultrasound systems to lower the noise bandwidth of the analog signal before analog-to-digital \nconversion. \nNote that the unused amplifier’s inputs should be tied to ground. \n1213\n14\n2\n1 6\n57 9\n108\nAD8054AD80543\nAD8054R6\n1kΩ\nR4\n2kΩ\nR3\n2kΩ R5\n2kΩR2\n2kΩR1\n3kΩC1\n50pF\nC2\n50pF\nVIN\nBAND-PASS\nFILTER OUTPUT\n01062-046 \nFigure 46. 2 MHz Biquad Band-Pass Filter Using AD8054 \nThe frequency response of the circuit is shown in Figure 47. \nFREQUENCY (Hz)0\n–10\n–20\n–30\n–40GAIN (dB)\n10k 100k 1M 10M 100M\n01062-047 \nFigure 47.

This converter is designed to convert I and Q signals in \ncommunications systems. In this application, only the I channel \nis being driven. The I channel is enabled by applying a logic \nhigh to SELECT (Pin 13). \nThe AD8051 is running from a dual supply and is configured \nfor a gain of +2. The input signal is terminated in 50 Ω and the \noutput is 2 V p-p, which is the maximum input range of the AD9201. The 22 Ω series resistor limits the maximum current that flows and helps to lower the distortion of the ADC. \nThe AD9201 has differential inputs for each channel. These are \ndesignated the A and B inputs. The B inputs of each channel are \nconnected to VREF (Pin 22), which supplies a positive reference of 2.5 V . Each of the B inputs has a small low-pass filter that also \nhelps to reduce distortion. \nThe output of the op amp is ac-coupled into INA-I (Pin 16) via \ntwo parallel capacitors to provide good high frequency and low frequency coupling. The 1 kΩ resistor references the signal to \nVREF that is applied to INB-I. Thus, INA-I swings both positive \nand negative with respect to the bias voltage applied to INB-I. \nWith the sampling clock running at 20 MSPS, the analog-to-\ndigital output was analyzed with a digital analyzer. Two input frequencies were used, 1 MHz and 9.5 MHz, which is just short of the Nyquist frequency. These signals were well filtered to \nminimize any harmonics. \nFigure 48 shows the FFT response of the ADC for the case of a \n1 MHz analog input. The SFDR is 71.66 dB, and the analog-to-\ndigital is producing 8.8 ENOB (effective number of bits). When \nthe analog frequency was raised to 9.5 MHz, the SFDR was  reduced to −60.18 dB and the ADC operated with 8.46 ENOBs \nas shown in Figure 49. The inclusion of the AD8051 in the \ncircuit did not worsen the distortion performance of the AD9201. \nPART# 0\nFCLK\nFUND\nVIN\nTHD\nSNR\nSINAD\nENOB\nSFDR\n2ND\n3RD\n4TH\n5TH\n6TH\n7TH\n8TH\n9THFFTSIZE 8192\n20.0MHz\n998.5kHz\n–0.51dB\n–68.13\n54.97\n54.76\n8.80\n71.66\n–74.53\n–76.06\n–76.35\n–79.05\n–80.36\n–75.08\n–88.12\n–77.8710\n0\n–10\n–20\n–30\n–40\n–50\n–60\n–70\n–80\n–90\n–100\n–110\n–120 AMPLITUDE (dB)\nFREQUENCY (MHz)0 123456789 1 0FUND\n2ND\n5TH 6TH7TH8TH 9TH4TH 3RD\n01062-049 \nFigure 48.

K | Page 20 of 24 SYNC STRIPPER \nSynchronizing pulses are sometimes carried on video signals so \nas not to require a separate channel to carry the synchronizing \ninformation. However, for some functions, such as analog-to-digital conversion, it is not desirable to have the sync pulses on \nthe video signal. These pulses reduce the dynamic range of the \nvideo signal and do not provide any useful information for such \na function. \nA sync stripper removes the synchronizing pulses from a video \nsignal while passing all the useful video information. Figure 51 shows a practical single-supply circuit that uses only a single AD8051. It is capable of directly driving a reverse terminated \nvideo line. \nAD80510.1µF 10µF+\n100ΩTO A/D3V OR 5VVBLANK\nGROUND0.4VVIDEO WITH SYNC\nGROUNDVIDEO WITHOUT SYNC\nR2\n1kΩ\nR1\n1kΩVIN 3\n27\n46\n0.8V\n(OR 2 × V BLANK )\n01062-051 \nFigure 51. Sync Stripper \nThe video signal plus sync is applied to the noninverting input \nwith the proper termination. The amplifier gain is set to 2 via \nthe two 1 kΩ resistors in the feedback circuit. A bias voltage \nmust be applied to R1 so that the input signal has the sync \npulses stripped at the proper level. \nThe blanking level of the input video pulse is the desired place to \nremove the sync information. This level is multiplied by 2 by the amplifier. This level must be at ground at the output for the sync stripping action to take place. Since the gain of the amplifier from \nthe input of R1 to the output is −1, a voltage equal to 2 × V\nBLANK  \nmust be applied to make the blanking level come out at ground. \nSINGLE-SUPPLY COMPOSITE VIDEO LINE DRIVER \nMany composite video signals have their blanking level at ground and have video information that is both positive and \nnegative. Such signals require dual-supply amplifiers to pass them. However, by ac level shifting, a single-supply amplifier can be used to pass these signals. The following complications can arise from such techniques. \nSignals of bounded peak-to-peak amplitude that vary in duty \ncycle require larger dynamic swing capacity than their (bounded) \npeak-to-peak amplitude after they are ac-coupled. As a worst case, the dynamic signal swing will approach twice the peak-to-peak value. The two conditions that define the maximum dynamic swing requirements are a signal that is mostly low but goes high with a duty cycle that is a small fraction of a percent, \nand the other extreme defined by the opposite condition. \nThe worst case of composite video is not quite this demanding. \nOne bounding condition is a signal that is mostly black for an entire frame but has a white (full amplitude) minimum width spike at least once in a frame. \nThe other extreme is for a full white video signal. The blanking \nintervals and sync tips of such a signal have negative-going \nexcursions in compliance with the composite video specifications. The combination of horizontal and vertical blanking intervals limit such a signal to being at the highest (white) level for a \nmaximum of about 75% of the time. \nAs a result of the duty cycles between the two extremes \npreviously presented, a 1 V p-p composite video signal that is \nmultiplied by a gain of 2 requires about 3.2 V p-p of dynamic \nvoltage swing at the output for an op amp to pass a composite \nvideo signal of arbitrarily varying duty cycle without distortion. \nSome circuits use a sync tip clamp to hold the sync tips at a \nrelatively constant level to lower the amount of dynamic signal swing required. However, these circuits can have artifacts, such as sync tip compression, unless they are driven by a source with \na very low output impedance. The AD8051 /AD8052/ AD8054 \nhave adequate signal swing when running on a single 5 V \nsupply to handle an ac-coupled composite video signal. \nThe input to the circuit in Figure 52 is a standard composite \n(1 V p-p) video signal that has the blanking level at ground. The input network level shifts the video signal by means of ac coupling. The noninverting input of the op amp is biased to half of the supply voltage. \nThe feedback circuit provides unity gain for the dc-biasing of \nthe input and provides a gain of 2 for any signals that are in the \nvideo bandwidth. The output is ac-coupled and terminated to \ndrive the line. \nThe capacitor values were selected for providing minimum tilt \nor field time distortion of the video signal. These values would be required for video that is considered to be studio or broadcast quality. However, if a lower consumer grade of video, sometimes \nreferred to as consumer video, is all that is desired, the values \nand the cost of the capacitors can be reduced by as much as a \nfactor of five with minimum visible degradation in the picture. \nAD80515V\n+10µF4.99kΩ\n220µF+1000µF\n0.1µF10kΩ+47µF4.99kΩ\n0.1µF 10µF+\nCOMPOSITE\nVIDEO\nIN 3\n27\n46\nRG\n1kΩRF\n1kΩRT\n75ΩRL\n75ΩVOUTRBT\n75Ω\n01062-052 \nFigure 52.
