The AD8138 can be used as a \nsingle-ended- to-differential amplifier or as a differential -to-\ndifferential amplifier. The AD8138 is as easy to use as an op \namp and greatly simplifies differential signal amplification and \ndriving.  Manufactured on  the proprietary  ADI XFCB bipolar \nprocess, the AD8138 has a −3 dB bandwidth of 320 MHz and \ndelivers a differential signal with the lowest harmonic distortion \navailable in a differential amplifier. The AD8138 has a unique \ninternal feedback feature t hat provides balanced output gain \nand phase matching, suppressing even order harmonics. The \ninternal feed back circuit also minimizes any gain error that \nwould be associated with the mismatches in the external gain \nsetting resistors.  \nThe differential  outpu t of the AD8138 helps balance the input \nto differential ADCs, maximizing the performance of the ADC.  The AD8138 eliminates the need f or a transformer with high \nperformance ADCs, preserving the low frequency and dc infor -\nmation. The common -mode level of the differential output is \nadjustable by a voltage on the V OCM pin, easily level- shifting the \ninput signals for driving single -supply AD Cs. Fast overload \nrecovery preserves sampling accuracy.  \nThe AD8138 distortion performance makes it an ideal ADC \ndriver for communication systems, with distortion performance \ngood enough to drive  state -of-the-art 10 -bit to 16 -bit converters \nat high frequencies. The high bandwidth and IP3 of the \nAD8138 also make it appropriate for use as a gain block in IF \nand baseband signal chains. The AD8138 offset and dynamic \nperformance makes  it well suited for a wide variety of signal \nprocessing and data acquisition applications.  \nThe AD8138 is available in both SOIC and MSOP packages for \noperation over −40°C to +85°C temperatures.  \n \nAD8138 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Operation beyond the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may \naffect product reliability.  \nTHERMAL RESISTANC E \nθJA is specified for the worst -case conditions, that is, θ JA is \nspecified for the device soldered in a circuit board in still air.  \nTable 6.  \nPackage Type  θJA Unit  \n8-Lead SOIC/4 -Layer  121 °C/W  \n8-Lead MSOP/4 -Layer  145 °C/W  \n \nMaximum  Power Dissipation  \nThe maximum safe  power dissipation in the AD8138 packages \nis limited by the associated rise in junction temperature (T J) on \nthe die. At approximately 150°C, which is the glass transition \ntemperature, the plastic changes its properties. Even temp orarily  \nexceeding this temperature limit can change the stresses that the \npackage exerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric \nperformance of the AD8138. Exceeding a junction te mperature \nof 150°C for an extended period can result in changes in the \nsilicon devices, potentially causing failure.  The power dissipated in the package (P D) is the sum of the \nquiescent power d issipation and the power dissipated in the \npackage due to the load drive for all outputs. The quiescent \npower is the voltage between the supply pins (V S) times the \nquiescent current (I S). The load current consists of the differential  \nand common -mode curren ts flowing to the load, as well as \ncurrents flowing through the external feedback networks and internal common -mode feedback loop. The internal resistor tap \nused in the common -mode feedback loop places a negligible  \ndifferential load on the output. RMS volt ages and currents \nshould be considered when dealing with ac signals. \nAirflow reduces θ\nJA. In addition, more metal directly in contact \nwith the package leads from metal traces through holes, ground,  \nand power planes reduces the θ JA. \nFigure 3 shows the maximum safe power dissipation in the \npackage vs. the ambient te mperature for the 8 -lead SOIC \n(121°C/W) and 8-lead MSOP ( θJA = 145°C/W) packages on a \nJEDEC standard 4 -layer board. θ JA values are a pproximations.  \nAMBIENTTEMPE RATURE(°C)MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)1.75\n1.50\n1.001.25\n0.50\n0.250.75\n0SOIC\nMSOP\n01073-049–40–30–20–100102030405060708090100110120\n \nFigure 3.

Circuit Definitions  \nDifferential voltage refers to the difference between two node \nvoltages. For example, the output differential voltage (or \nequivalently output differential -mode voltage) is defined as  \nVOUT,  dm = (V+OUT − V−OUT) \nwhere  V+OUT and V−OUT refer to the voltages at the +OUT and \n−OUT terminals with respect to a common reference.  Common -mode voltage refers to the average of two node \nvoltages. The output common -mode vol tage is defined as  \nVOUT,  cm = (V +OUT + V−OUT)/2 \nBalance is a measure of how  well differential signals are \nmatched in amplitude and exactly 180 ° apart in phase. Balance \nis most easily determined by placing a well -matched resistor \ndivider between the differential voltage nodes and comparing \nthe magnitude of the signal at the midpoi nt of the divider with \nthe magnitude of the differential signal (see Figure 41). By this \ndefinition, output balance is the magnitude of the output \ncommon -mode voltage divided by the magnitude of the output \ndifferential  mode voltage :  \ndm OUTcm OUT\nVV\nError Balance Output\n,,=  \n \n \nData Sheet AD8138 \n \nRev. G | Page 17 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe AD8138 differs from conventional op amps in that it has \ntwo outputs whose voltages move in opposite directions. Like \nan op amp, it relies on  high open -loop gain and negative \nfeedback to force these outputs to the desired voltages. The AD8138 behaves much like a standard voltage feedback op  \namp and makes it easy to perform single -ended-to-differential \nconversion, common -mode level -shifting, and amplification of \ndifferential signals. Also like an op amp, the AD8138 has high \ninput impedance and low output impedance.  \nPrevious d ifferential drivers, both discrete and integrated \ndesigns, have been based on using two independent amplifiers and two independent feedback loops, one to control each of the outputs. When these circuits are driven from a single- ended \nsource, the resulting outputs are typically not well balanced. Achieving a balanced output has typically required exceptional matching of the amplifiers and feedback networks.  \nDC common -mode level -shifting has also been difficult with \nprevious differential drivers. Level -shifting has required the use \nof a third amplifier and feedback loop to control the output common -mode level. Sometimes the third amplifier has also \nbeen used to attempt to correct an inherently unbalanced \ncircuit. Excellent performance over a wide frequency ran ge  \nhas proven difficult with this approach.  \nThe AD8138 uses two feedback loops to separately control the \ndifferential and common -mode output voltages. The differential \nfeedback, set with externa l resistors, controls only the differentia l \noutput voltage. The common -mode feedback controls only the \ncommon -mode output voltage. This architecture makes it easy \nto arbitrarily set the output common -mode level. It is forced, by \ninternal common -mode feedba ck, to be equal to the voltage \napplied to the V\nOCM input, without affecting the differential \noutput voltage.  \nThe AD8138 architecture results in outputs that are very highly \nbalanced over a wide f requency range without requiring tightly \nmatched external components. The common -mode feedback \nloop forces the signal component of the output common -mode \nvoltage to be zeroed. The result is nearly perfectly balanced \ndifferential outputs of identical amplit ude and exactly 180°apart  \nin phase.  ANALYZING AN APPLICA TION CIRCUIT  \nThe AD8138 uses high open -loop gain and negative feedback to \nforce its differential and common -mode output voltages in such \na way as to minimize the differential and common -mode error \nvoltages. The differential error voltage is defined as the voltage \nbetween the differential  inputs labeled +IN and −IN in Figure 42. \nFor most purposes, this voltage can be assumed to be zero. \nSimilarly, the difference between the actual output common -\nmode voltage and the voltage applied to V OCM can also be \nassumed to  be zero. Starting f rom these two assumptions, any \napplication circuit can be analyzed.  \nSETTING THE CLOSED -LOOP GAIN  \nNeglecting the capacitors C F, the differential -mode gain of the \ncircuit in Figure 42 can b e determined to be described by  \nS\nGS\nF\ndmINdm OUT\nRR\nVV=\n,, \nThis assumes the input resistors, R GS, and feedback resistors, R FS, \non each side are equal.  \nESTIMATING THE OUTPU T NOISE VOLTAGE  \nSimilar to the case of a conventional op amp, the differential \noutput errors (noise and offset voltages) can be es timated by \nmultiplying the input referred terms, at +IN and −IN, by the \ncircuit noise gain. The noise gain is defined as  \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+=\nGF\nNRRG 1  \nTo compute the total output referred noise for the circuit of \nFigure 42, consideration  must also be given to the contribution \nof the Resistors RF and RG.

G | Page 18 of 24 When using the AD8138 in gain configurations where  RF/RG of \none feedback network is unequal to  RF/RG of the other network, \nthere is a differential output noise due to input -referred voltage \nin the V OCM circuitry. The output noise is defined in terms of \nthe following feedback terms (refer to Figure 42): \nG FG\nR RR\n+=β1  \nfor −OUT to +IN loop, and  \nG FG\nR RR\n+=β2  \nfor +OUT to −IN loop.

The \namplitudes of the signals at each output remain s equal and 180 ° \nout of phase. The input -to-output differential -mode gain v aries \nproportionately to the feedback mismatch, but the output \nbalance is unaffected.  \nRatio matching errors in the external resistors result in  a \ndegradation of the ability  of the circuit  to reject input common -\nmode signals, much the same as for a four -resistor difference \namplifier made from a conventional op amp.  \nIn addition, if the dc levels of the input and output common -\nmode voltages are different, matching errors result in a smal l \ndifferential -mode output offset voltage. For the G = 1 case, with \na ground referenced input signal and the output common -mode \nlevel set for 2.5 V , an output offset of as much as 25 mV (1% of \nthe difference in common -mode levels) can result if 1% toleranc e \nresistors are used. Resistors of 1% tolerance result in a worst-case input CMRR of about 40 dB, worst- case differential mode \noutput offset of 25 mV due to 2.5 V level -shift, and no significant  \ndegradation in output balance error.  \n \n \n CALCULATING THE  INP UT IMPEDANCE  OF AN \nAPPLICATION \nThe effective input impedance of a circuit such as the one in \nFigure 42, at +DIN and – DIN, depend s on whether the amplifier  is \nbeing driven by a single -ended or differential signal source. For \nbalanced  differential input signals, the input impedance ( RIN, dm) \nbetween the inputs (+D IN and −DIN) is simply  \nRIN, dm =2 × RG \nIn the case of a single -ended input signal (for example if − DIN is \ngrounded and the input signal is applied to +D IN), the input \nimpedanc e becomes  \n()\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n+×−=F GFG\ndmIN\nR RRRR\n21,  \nThe input impedance  of the circuit  is effectively higher than it \nwould be for a conventional op amp connected as an inverter \nbecause a fraction of the differential output voltage appears at the inputs as a common -mode sign al, partially bootstrapping \nthe voltage across the input resistor R\nG.  \nINPUT COMMON-MODE VOLTAGE RANGE  IN \nSINGLE -SUPPLY APPLICATIONS  \nThe AD8138 is optimized for level -shifting, ground -referenced  \ninput signals. For a single -ended input, this would imply, for \nexample, that the voltage at − DIN in Figure 42 would be 0 V \nwhen the negative power supply voltage of the amplifier  (at V −) \nis also set to 0 V .  \nSETTING THE OUTPUT C OM MON -MODE VOLTAGE  \nThe V OCM pin of the AD8138 is internally biased at a voltage \napproximately equal to the midsupply point (average value of the voltages on V+ and V −). Relying on this internal bi as result s \nin an output common -mode voltage that is within about \n100 mV of the expected value.  \nIn cases where more accurate control of the output common -\nmode level is required, it is recommended that an external source, or resistor divider (made up of 10 k Ω resistors), be used. \nThe output common -mode offset listed in the Specifications  \nsection assumes the V\nOCM input is driven by a low impedance \nvoltage source.  \nDRIVING A CAPACITIVE  LOAD  \nA purely capacitive load can react with the p in and bondwire \ninductance of the AD8138, resulting in high frequency ringing \nin the pulse response. One way to minimize this effect is to place a small capacitor across each of the feedback resistors. The added capacitance should be small to avoid destabilizing the amplifier. An alternative technique is to place a small resisto r in \nseries with the  outputs  of the amplifier , as shown in Figure 40. \nData Sheet AD8138 \n \nRev. G | Page 19 of 24 LAYOUT, GROUNDING, A ND BY PASSING   \nAs a high speed device , the AD8138 is sensitive to the PCB \nenvironment in which it has to operate. Realizing its superior \nspecifications requires attention to various details of good high \nspeed PCB design.  \nThe first requirement is for a good solid ground plane that \ncovers as much of the board area around the AD8138 as \npossible. The only exception to this is that the two input pins \n(Pin 1 and Pin 8) should be kept a few millimeters from the \nground plane, and ground should be removed from inner layers \nand the opposite side of the board under the input pins. This \nminimize s the stray capacitance on these nodes and help s \npreserve th e gain flatness vs. frequency.  The power supply pins should be bypassed as close as possible \nto the device to the nearby ground plane. Good high frequency \nceramic chip capacitors should be used. This bypassing should \nbe done with a capacitance value of 0 .01 µF to 0.1 µ F for each \nsupply. Further away, low frequency bypassing should be provided \nwith 10 µ F tantalum capacitors from each supply to ground.  \nThe signal routing should be short and direct to avoid parasitic \neffects. Wherever there are complementar y signals, a symmetrical  \nlayout should be provided to the extent possible to maximize the balance performance. When running differential signals \nover a long distance, the traces on the PCB should be close together or any differential wiring should be twist ed together to \nminimize the area of the loop that is formed. This reduce s the \nradiated energy and make s the circuit less susceptible to \ninterference.  \n \nAD8138 Data Sheet \n \nRev. G | Page 20 of 24 BALANCED TRANSFORMER DRIVER  \nTransformers are among the oldest devices used to perform a \nsingle -ended- to-differential conversion (and vice versa). Trans -\nformers can also perform the additional functions of galvanic \nisolation, step -up or step -down of voltages, and impedance \ntransformation. For these reasons, transformers always find \nuses in certain applicati ons.  \nHowever, when driving the  transformer in a single -ended \nmanner , there is an imbalance at the output due to the parasitics \ninherent in the transformer. The primary (or driven) side of the \ntransformer has one side at dc potential (usually ground), while \nthe other side is driven. This can cause problems in systems that require good balance of the differential output signals  of the \ntransformer .  \nIf the interwinding capacitance (C\nSTRAY ) is assumed to be \nuniformly distributed, a signal from the driving source couple s \nto the secondary output terminal that is closest to the driven \nside of the primary . On the other hand, no signal is  coupled to \nthe opposite terminal of the secondary because its nearest \nprimary terminal is not driven (see Figure 43). The exact \namount of this imbalance depend s on the particular parasitics \nof the trans -former, but is mostly a problem at higher \nfrequencies.  \nThe balance of a differential  circuit can be measured by \nconnecting an equal -valued resistive voltage divider across the \ndifferential outputs and then measuring the center point of the circuit with respect to ground. Since the two differential outputs \nare supposed to be of equal ampli tude, but 180° opposite phase, \nthere should be no signal present for perfectly balanced outputs.  \nThe circuit in Figure 43 shows a Mini -Circuits ® T1-6T \ntransformer connected with its primary driven single -endedly \nand the secondary connected with a precision voltage divider \nacross its terminals. The voltage divider is made up of two \n500 Ω, 0.005% precision resistors. The voltage V\nUNBAL , which is \nalso equal to the ac common -mode voltage, is a measure of how \nclosely the outputs are bal anced.  \nFigure 45 compare s the transformer being driven single -\nendedly by a signal generator and being driven differentially using an AD8138. The top signal trace of Figure 45 shows the \nbalance of the single -ended configuration, while the bottom \nshows the differentially driven balance response. The 100 MHz \nbalance is 35 dB better when using the AD8138.  The well -balanced outputs of the AD8138 provide a drive signal \nto each of the primary inputs  of the transformer  that are of \nequal amplitude and 180° out of phase. Th erefore , depen ding \non how the polarity of the secondary is connected, the signals \nthat conduct across the interwinding capacit ance either both \nassist the  secondary signal  of the transformer  equally, or both \nbuck the secondary signals. In either case, the parasitic effec t is \nsymmetrical and provide s a well -balanced transformer output \n(see Figure 45). \nPRIMARYCSTRAY\nCSTRAY52.3Ω SECONDAR YVDIFF500Ω\n0.005%\n500Ω\n0.005%VUNBA LSIGNAL ISCOUPLED\nONTHISSIDEVIACSTRAY\nNOSIGNAL ISCOUPLED\nONTHISSIDE\n01073-042 \nFigure 43.

G | Page 21 of 24 HIGH PERFORMANCE ADC DRIVING  \nThe circuit in Figure 46 shows a simplified front -end \nconnection for an AD8138 driving an AD9224, a 12 -bit, \n40 MSPS AD C. The ADC works best when driven differentially, \nwhich minimizes its distortion. The AD8138 eliminates the \nneed for a transformer to drive the ADC and  performs single -\nended -to-differential conversion, common -mode level -shifting, \nand buffering of the driving signal.  \nThe positive and negative outputs of the AD8138  are connected \nto the respectiv e differential inputs of the AD9224 via a pair of \n49.9 Ω resistors to minimize the effects of the switched -capacitor  \nfront end of the AD9224. For best distortion performance, it \nruns from supplies of ±5 V .  \nThe AD8138 is configured with unity gain for a single -ended, \ninput -to-differential output. The additional 23 Ω, 523 Ω total, at \nthe input to −IN is to balance the parallel impedance of the \n50 Ω source and its 50 Ω termination that driv es the \nnoninverting input.  \n The signal generator has a ground -referenced, bipolar output, \nthat is , it drives symmetrically above and below ground. \nConnecting V OCM to the CML pin of the AD9224 sets the output \ncommon -mode of the AD8138 at 2.5 V , which is the midsupply \nlevel for the AD9224. This voltage is bypassed by a 0.1 µF \ncapaci tor.  \nThe full -scale analog input range of the AD9224 is set to  \n4 V p-p, by shorting the SENSE terminal to AVSS. This has \nbeen determined to be the scaling to provide minimum \nharmonic distortion.  \nFor the AD8138  to swing at 4 V p -p, each output swings 2 V p -p \nwhile providing signals that are 180° out of phase. With a \ncommon -mode voltage at the output of 2.5 V , each AD8138 \noutput swing s between 1.5 V and 3.5 V .  \nA ground -referenced 4 V p -p, 5 MHz signal at D IN+ was used to \ntest the circuit in Figure 46.

G | Page 22 of 24 3 V OPERATION \nThe circuit in Figure 47 shows a simplified front-end \nconnection for an AD8138 driving an AD9203, a 10-bit, \n40 MSPS ADC that is specified to work on a single 3 V supply. \nThe ADC works best when driven differentially to make the best use of the signal swing available within the 3 V supply.  The appropriate outputs of the AD8138 are connected to the \nappropriate differential inputs of the AD9203 via a low-pass filter.  \nThe AD8138 is configured for unity gain for a single-ended \ninput to differential output. The additional 23 Ω at the input to \n−IN is to balance the impedance of the 50 Ω source and its 50 Ω \ntermination that drives the noninverting input.  \nThe signal generator has ground-referenced, bipolar output, \nthat is, it can drive symmetrically above and below ground. \nEven though the AD8138 has ground as its negative supply, it \ncan still function as a level-shifter with such an input signal.  \nThe output common mode is raised up to midsupply by the \nvoltage divider that biases V\nOCM. In this way, the AD8138 \nprovides dc coupling and level-shifting of a bipolar signal, \nwithout inverting the input signal.  \nThe low-pass filter between the AD8138 and the AD9203 \nprovides filtering that helps to improve the signal-to-noise ratio \n(SNR). Lower noise can be realized by lowering the pole \nfrequency, but the bandwidth of the circuit is lowered.  \n49.9Ω\n0.1µF\n10kΩ523Ω499Ω10kΩ\n20pF49.9Ω\n20pF\n499Ω499Ω\n0.1µF3V\nDRVDD AVDD\nAINNAINP0.1µF 0.1µF3V\n49.9ΩAD8138+\nAD92038\n2\n13\n5\n4\n628 2\n2725\n26\n1AVSS DRVSSDIGITAL\nOUTPUTS\n01073-046 \nFigure 47.
