For USB compliance these may require a slight \nadjustment.  This timing can be modified through a programmable setting stored in the same external \nEEPROM that is used for the USB descriptors.   Timing can also be changed by adding appropriat e passive \ncomponents to the USB signals.  \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  4  \nFT2232H  Dual High Speed USB to

It has \nthe capability of being configured in a variety of industry standard serial or parallel interfaces.  \n \nThe FT2232H has two independent configurable interfaces. Each interface can be configured as UART, \nFIFO, JTAG, SPI, I2C or bit -bang mode with independent baud rate generators. In addition to these, the \nFT2232H supports a host bus  emulation mode, a CPU -Style FIFO mode and a fast opto -isolated serial \ninterface mode.  \n \n4.1 Key Features  \nUSB High Speed to Dual Interfac e. The FT2232H is a USB 2.0 High Speed (480Mbits/s) to dual \nindependent flexible and configurable parallel/serial interfaces.  \n \nFunctional Integration . The FT2232H integrates a USB protocol engine which controls the physical \nUniversal Transceiver Macrocell Interface (UTMI) and handles all aspects of the USB 2.0 High Speed \ninterface. The FT222H includes an integrated +1.8V Low Drop -Out (LDO) regulator and 12MHz to 480MHz \nPLL. It also includes 4kbytes Tx and Rx data buffers per interface. The FT2232H effective ly integrates the \nentire USB protocol on a chip with no firmware required.  \n \nMPSSE .Multi -Purpose Synchronous Serial Engines (MPSSE), capable of speeds up to 30 Mbits/s, provides \nflexible synchronous interface configurations.  \n \nData Transfer rate.  The FT2232H  support s a data transfer rate up to 12 Mbaud when configured as an \nRS232/RS422/RS485 UART interface or greater than 25 Mbytes/second over a synchronous parallel FIFO \ninterface.  Please note  the FT2232H do es not support the baud rates of 7 Mbaud 9 Mbaud, 10  Mbaud and \n11 Mbaud . \n \nLatency Timer. This is really a feature of the driver and is used to as a timeout to flush short packets of \ndata back to the PC. The default is 16ms, but it can be altered between 0ms and 255ms. At 0ms latency \nyou get a packet transfe r on every high speed microframe.  \n \n4.2 Functional Block Descriptions  \nDual Multi -Purpose UART/FIFO Controllers. The FT2232H has two independent UART/FIFO \nControllers. These control the UART data, 245 fifo data, opto isolation (Fast Serial) or control the Bit -\nBang mode if selected by SETUP command. Each Multi -Purpose UART/FIFO Controller also contains  an \nMPSSE ( Multi-Protocol Synchronous  Serial Engine) which can be used independently of each other. Using \nthis MPSSE, the Multi -Purpose UART/FIFO Controller can be c onfigured, under software command, to \nhave 1 MPSSE + 1 UART / 245 FIFO (each UART / 245 can be set to Bit Bang mode to gain extra I/O if \nrequired) or 2 MPSSE.  \n \nUSB Protocol Engine and FIFO control. The USB Protocol Engine controls and manages the interface  \nbetween the UTMI PHY and the FIFOs of the chip. It also handles power management and the USB \nprotocol specification.  \n \nDual Port FIFO TX Buffer (4Kbytes per interface). Data from the Host PC is stored in these buffers \nto be used by the Multi -purpose UART/F IFO controllers. This is controlled by the USB Protocol Engine and \nFIFO control block.  \n \nDual Port FIFO RX Buffer (4Kbytes per interface). Data from the Multi -purpose UART/FIFO \ncontrollers is stored in these blocks to be sent back to the Host PC when reques ted. This is controlled by \nthe USB Protocol Engine and FIFO control block.  \n \nRESET Generator – The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power -on reset to the device \ninternal circuitry at power up. The RESET# input pin allows an external devic e to reset the FT2232H. \nRESET# should be tied to VCCIO (+3.3v) if not being used.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  27  \nFT2232H  Dual High Speed USB to Multipurpose UART/FIFO IC  Datasheet  \nVersion 2.6  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000061    Clearance No.: FTDI#77  \n \nIndependent Baud Rate Generators – The Baud Rate Generators provides an x16 or an x10 clock \ninput to the UART’s from a 120MHz reference clock and consists of a 14 bit pre -scaler and 4 register bits \nwhich provide fine tuning of the baud rate (used to divide by a number plus a fraction). This determines \nthe Baud Rate of the UART which is programmable from 183 baud to 12 million baud. The FT2232H does \nnot support the baud rat es of 7 Mbaud 9 Mbaud, 10 Mbaud and 11 Mbaud . \n \nSee FTDI application note  AN232B -05 for more details.  \n  \n+1.8V LDO Regulator. The +1.8V LDO regulator generates the +1.8 volts for the core and the USB \ntransceiver cell. Its input (VREGIN) must be connected to a +3.3V external power source. It is also \nrecommended to add an external filtering capacitor to the VREGIN. There is no direct connection from the \n+1.8V output (VREGOUT) and the internal functions of  the FT2232H. The PCB must be routed to connect \nVREGOUT to the pins that require the +1.8V including VREGIN.  \n \nUTMI PHY . The Universal Transceiver Macrocell Interface (UTMI) physical interface cell. This block \nhandles the Full speed / High Speed SERDES (ser ialise – deserialise) function for the USB TX/RX data. It \nalso provides the clocks for the rest of the chip. A 12 MHz crystal should be connected to the OSCI and \nOSCO pins. A 12K Ohm resistor should be connected between REF and GND on the PCB.  \n \n The UTMI P HY functions include:  \n \n\uf0b7 Supports 480 Mbit/s “High Speed” (HS)/ 12 Mbit/s “Full Speed” (FS), FS Only and “Low Speed” \n(LS) \n\uf0b7 SYNC/EOP generation and checking  \n\uf0b7 Data and clock recovery from serial stream on the USB.  \n\uf0b7 Bit-stuffing/unstuffing; bit stuff error detecti on. \n\uf0b7 Manages USB Resume, Wake Up and Suspend functions.  \n\uf0b7 Single parallel data clock output with on -chip PLL to generate higher speed serial data clocks.  \n \nEEPROM Interface .  When used without an external EEPROM the FT2232H defaults to a USB to dual \nasynchrono us serial port device. Adding an external 93C46 (93C56 or 93C66) EEPROM allows each of the \nchip’s channels to be independently configured as a serial UART (RS232 mode), parallel FIFO (245) mode \nor fast serial (opto isolation). The external EEPROM can also be used to customise the USB VID, PID, \nSerial Number, Product Description Strings and Power Descriptor value of the FT2232H for OEM \napplications. Other parameters controlled by the EEPROM include Remote Wake Up, Soft Pull Down on \nPower -Off and I/O pin driv e strength.  \n \nThe EEPROM should be a 16 bit wide configuration such as a Microchip 93LC46B or equivalent capable of \na 1Mbit/s clock rate at VCC = +3.00V to 3.6V. The EEPROM is programmable in -circuit over USB using a \nutility program called FT_PROG . This allows a blank part to be soldered onto the PCB and programmed as \npart of the manufacturing and test process.  \n \nIf no EEPROM is  connected (or the EEPROM is blank), the FT2232H will default to dual serial ports. The \ndevice uses its built -in default VID (0403 ), PID (6010) Product Description and Power Descriptor Value. \nIn this case, the device will not have a serial number as part o f the USB descriptor.  \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  28  \nFT2232H  Dual High Speed USB to Multipurpose UART/FIFO IC  Datasheet  \nVersion 2.6  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000061    Clearance No.: FTDI#77  \n \n4.3 Dual Port FT232 UART Interface Mode Description  \n \nThe FT2232H can be configured in similar UART modes as the FTDI FT232 devices.

It has separate enables on both the transmitter and receiver. With RS485, the \ntransmitter is only enabled when a character is being transmitted from the UART. The TXDEN pins on the \nFT2232H are provided for exactly that purpose, and so the tran smitter enables are wired to the TXDEN’s. \nThe receiver enable is active low, so it is wired to the PWREN# pin to disable the receiver when in USB \nsuspend mode.  \n \nRS485 is a multi -drop network – i.e. many devices can communicate with each other over a sing le two \nwire cable connection. The RS485 cable requires to be terminated at each end of the cable. Links are \nprovided to allow the cable to be terminated if the device is physically positioned at either end of the \ncable.  \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  31  \nFT2232H  Dual High Speed USB to Multipurpose UART/FIFO IC  Datasheet  \nVersion 2.6  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000061    Clearance No.: FTDI#77  \n \nIn this example the data transmitt ed by the FT2232H is also received by the device that is transmitting. \nThis is a common feature of RS485 and requires the application software to remove the transmitted data \nfrom the received data stream. With the FT2232H it is possible to do this entirely  in hardware – simply \nmodify the schematic so that RXD of the FT2 232H is the logical OR of the level converter device  receiver \noutput with TXDEN using an HC32 or similar logic gate . \n \nWith the FT2 232H it is possible to do this entirely in hardware – simply modify the schematic so that RXD \nof the FT2 232H is the logical OR of the level converter device  receiver output with TXDEN using an HC32 \nor similar logic gate . \n \n4.4 FT245 Synchronous FIFO Interface Mode Description  \n \nWhen channel A is configured in an FT245 Syn chronous FIFO interface mode the IO timing of the signals \nused are shown in  \nFigure  4.4, which shows details for read and write accesses.

The chip drives a \n60 MHz CLKOUT clock for the external system to use.  \n \nNote that Asynchronous FIFO mode must be selected on both channels before selecting the Synchronous \nFIFO mode in software.  \n \n4.4.1  FT245 Synchronous FIFO Read Operati on \n \nA read operation is started when the chip drives RXF# low. The external system can then drive OE# low \nto turn around the data bus drivers before acknowledging the data with the RD# signal going low. The \nfirst data byte is on the bus after OE# is low. T he external system can burst the data out of the chip by \nkeeping RD# low or it can insert wait states in the RD# signal. If there is more data to be read it will \nchange on the clock following RD# sampled low. Once all the data has been consumed, the chip w ill drive \nRXF# high. Any data that appears on the data bus, after RXF# is high, is invalid and should be ignored.  \n \n4.4.2  FT245 Synchronous FIFO Write Operation  \nA write operation can be started when TXE# is low . WR# is brought low when the data is valid. A burst \noperation can be done on every clock providing TXE# is still low. The external system m ust monitor TXE# \nand its own WR # to check that data has been accepted. Both TXE# and WR # must be low for data to be \naccepted.  \n \n4.5 FT245 Asynchronous FIFO Interface Mode Des cription  \n \nThe FT2232H can be configured as a dual channel asynchronous FIFO interface. This mode is similar to \nthe synchronous FIFO interface with the exception that the data is written to or read from th e FIFO on \nthe falling edge of the WR # or RD# signals.  \n \nThis mode does not provide a CLKOUT signal and it does not expect an OE# input signal.

The following sections give some details of the read \nand write cycle waveforms and timings. The CLKOUT output clock can operate up to 60MHz.  \n \nIn Host Bus Emulation mode the clock divisor has no effect. The clock div isor is used for serial data and is \na different part of the MPSSE block.

If either channel A or channel B is enabled in Fast Opto -Isolated Serial mode then the \npins on channel B are switched to  the fast serial interface configuration. The I/O interface for fast serial \nmode is always on channel B, even if both channels are being used in this mode. An address bit is used \nto determine the source or destination channel of the data. It therefore make s sense to always use at \nleast channel B or both for fast serial mode, but not A own its own.  \n \nFast serial mode is enabled by setting the appropriate bits in the external EEPROM. The fast serial mode \ncan be held in reset by setting a bit value of 10 using the Set Bit Bang Mode command. While this bit is \nset the device is held reset – data can be sent to the device, but it will not be sent out by the device until \nthe device is enabled again. This is done by sending a bit value of 0 using the set bit mode com mand. \nSee application note AN2232L -02, “Bit Mode Functions for the FT2232D  for more details and examples.  \n \nWhen either Channel B or both Channel A and B are  configured in Fast Opto -Isolated Serial Interface \nmode the IO timing of the signals used are shown in  \nFigure  4.13 and the timings are shown in Table 4.6 \n \n \nFigure 4.13 Fast Opto -Isolated Serial Interface Signal Waveforms  \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  39  \nFT2232H  Dual High Speed USB to Multipurpose UART/FIFO IC  Datasheet  \nVersion 2.6  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000061    Clearance No.: FTDI#77  \n \nName Minimum Typical Maximu Units Description\nt1 5 ns FSDO/FSCTS hold time\nt2 5 ns FSDO/FSCTS setup time\nt3 5 ns FSDI hold time\nt4 10 ns FSDI Setup Time\nt5 10 ns FSCLK low\nt6 10 ns FSCLK high\nt7 20 ns FSCLK Period\n \nTable 4.6 Fast Opto -Isolated Serial Interface Signal Timings  \n \n4.8.1  Outgoing Fast Serial Data  \nTo send fast serial data out of the FT2232H, the external device must drive the FSCLK clock. If the \nFT2232H has data ready to send, it will drive FSDO output low to indicate the start bit. It will not do  this \nif it is currently receiving data from the external device.

The first bit output (Start bit) is always 0.  \n2. FSDO is always sent LSB first.  \n3. The last serial bit output is the source bit (SRCE). It indicates which channel the data has come \nfrom. A ‘0’ means that it has come from Channel A, a ‘1’ mean s that it has come from Channel B.  \n4. If the target device is unable to accept the data when it detects the START bit, it should stop the \nFSCLK until it can accept the data.  \n \n4.8.2  Incoming Fast Serial Data  \nAn external device is allowed to send data into the FT2232 H if FSCTS is high. On receipt of a zero START \nbit on FSDI, the FT2232H will drop FSCTS on the next positive clock edge. The data from bits 0 to 7 are \nthen clocked in (LSB first). The last bit (DEST) determines where the data will be written to. The data c an \nbe sent to either channel A or to channel B. If DEST= ‘0’, the data is sent to channel A, (assuming \nchannel A is enabled for fast serial mode, otherwise the data is sent to channel B). If DEST= ‘1’ the data \nis sent to channel B, (assuming channel B is e nabled for fast serial mode, otherwise the data will go to \nchannel A. (Either channel A, channel B or both channels must be enabled as fast serial mode or the \nfunction is disabled).

CTS goes low after data bit \n0 (D0) and stays low until the chip can accept more data.  \n \n4.8.3  Fast Opto -Isolated Serial Data Interface Example  \nThe following example,  Figure 4.16 , shows tw o Agilent HCPL -2430 (see the semiconductor section at  \nwww.agilent.com ) high speed opto -couplers used to optically isolate an external device which \ninterfaced to USB using the FT2232H.

There are two types of \nbit-bang modes: synchronous and asynchronous.  \n \nAsyn chronous Bit -Bang Mode  \n \nAsynchronous Bit -Bang mode is the same as BM -style Bit -Bang mode, exce pt that the internal RD# and \nWR# strobes (RDSTB# and WRSTB#) are now brought out of the device to allow external logic to be \nclocked by accesses to the bit -bang I O bus.  \nOn either or both channels any data written to the device in the normal manner will be self clocked onto \nthe data pins (those which have been configured as outputs). Each pin can be independently set as an \ninput or an output. The rate that the data is clocked out at is controlled by the baud rate generator.  \nFor the data to change there has to be new data written, and the baud rate clock has to tick. If no new \ndata is written to the channel, the pins will hold the last value written.  \n \nSynchronous Bit -Bang Mode  \n \nThe synchronous Bit -Bang mode will only update the output parallel port pins whenever data is sent from \nthe USB interface to the parallel interface. When this is done, the WRSTB# will activate to indicate that \nthe data has been read from the USB  Rx FIFO buffer and written out on the pins. Data can only be \nreceived from the parallel pins (to the USB Tx FIFO interface) when the parallel interface has been \nwritten to.  \n \nWith Synchronous Bit -Bang mode data will only be sent out by the FT2232H if there  is space in the \nFT2232H USB TXFIFO for data to be read from the parallel interface pins. This Synchronous Bit -Bang \nmode will read the data bus parallel I/O pins first, before it transmits data from the USB RxFIFO. It is \ntherefore 1 byte behind the output,  and so to read the inputs for the byte that you have just sent, \nanother byte must be sent.  \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  43  \nFT2232H  Dual High Speed USB to Multipurpose UART/FIFO IC  Datasheet  \nVersion 2.6  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000061    Clearance No.: FTDI#77  \n \nFor example : - \n \n(1) Pins start at 0xFF  \nSend 0x55,0xAA  \nPins go to 0x55 and then to 0xAA  \nData read = 0xFF,0x55  \n \n(2) Pins start at 0xFF  \nSend 0x55,0xAA,0xAA  \n(repeat t he last byte sent)  \nPins go to 0x55 and then to 0xAA  \nData read = 0xFF,0x55,0xAA  \n \nSynchronous Bit -Bang Mode differs from Asynchronous Bit -Bang mode in that the device parallel output \nis only read when the parallel output is written to by the USB interface. T his makes it easier for the \ncontrolling program to measure the response to a USB output stimulus as the data returned to the USB \ninterface is synchronous to the output data.  \n \nAsynchronous Bit -Bang mode is enabled using Set Bit Bang Mode driver command.

The WRSTB# goes active when data is read from the USB RXFIFO (i.e. \nsent from the PC). The RDSTB# goes inactive when data is sampled from the pins and written to the USB \nTXFIFO (i.e. sent to the PC). The SETUP command to the FT2232H is used to setup the bit -mode. This \ncommand also contains a byte wide data mask to set the direction of each bit. The direction on each pin \ndoesn’t change unless a new SETUP command is used to modify the direction.  \n \nThe WRSTB# and RDSTB# strobes is only a guide to what may be happening depending on the direction \nof the bus. For example if all pins are configured as inputs, it is still necessary to write to these pins in \norder to get the  FT2232H to read those pins even though the data written will never appear on the pins.  \n \nSignals and data -flow are illustrated in Figure 4.20 \n \nUSB Rx \nFIFO/\nBuffer\nParallel I/O \ndataParallel \nI/O pins USBWRSTB#\nRDSTB#USB Tx \nFIFO/\nBuffer\n \nFigure 4.20 Bit-bang Mode Dataflow Illustration Diagram  \n \n4.11  RS232 UART Mode LED Interface Description  \n \nWhen configured in UART mode the FT2232H has two IO pins on each channel dedicated to controll ing \nLED status indicators, one for transmitted data the other for received data.

This can be used to get \nshort packets of data back to the PC without waiting for the latency timer to expire.  \n \nThis mechanism should only be used when you have stopped sending data to the chip to avoid overrun.  \n \nThe data transfer is flagged to the USB hos t by the falling edge of the signal.  \n \nCLKOUT\nWR#\nSIWU#D7-D0\n \nFigure 4.23 Using SIWU#  \n \nWhen the pin is being used for a Wake Up function to wake up a sleeping PC a 20ms negative pulse on \nthis pin is req uired.

When using remote wake -up, ensure the resistors are pulled -up in suspend.   Also ensure \nperipheral designs  do not allow any curr ent sink paths that may partially power the  peripheral.  \n2.  If remote wake -up is enabled, a peripheral is allowed to draw up to 2.5mA in suspend.   If remote \nwake-up is disabled, the peripheral must draw no more than 500uA in suspend.   \n3. If a Pull -down is enable d, the FT2232H will not wake up from suspend.  \n \n4.13  FT2232H Mode Selection  \n \nThe 2 channels of the FT2232H reset to 2 asynchronous serial interfaces.  \nFollowing a reset the required mode of each channel is determined by the contents of t he EEPROM \n(programmed using  FT_PROG ).  \n \nThe EEPROM contents determine if the 2 channels have been configured as FT232 asynchronous serial \ninterface, FT245 FIFO  interface, CPU -style FIFO interface or Fast Serial Interface.  \n \nFollowing a reset, the EEPROM is read to determine which mode is configured. After device enumeration, \nan FT_SetBitMode  command (refer to D2XX_Programmers_Guide ) can be sent to the USB driver  to \nswitch the selected interface into the required mode – asynchronous bit -bang, synchronous bit -bang or \nMPSSE.  \n \nWhen in FT245 FIFO mode, the FT_SetBitMode  command can be used to select either Synchronous \nFIFO ( FT_SetBitMode  = 0x40) or Asynchronous FIFO m ode. (Note that Asynchronous FIFO mode must \nbe selected on both channels before selecting the Synchronous FIFO mode. This means that an EEPROM \nis needed to initially configure Asynchronous FIFO mode before software configures the Synchronous \nFIFO mode).  \n \nWhen Synchronous FIFO mode selected, channel A uses all the memory resources of channel B. As such \nchannel B is then not available. In this case the state of the channel B pins is determined when the \nconfiguration is switched to Asynchronous FIFO mode. If c hannel B had not been used for any data \ntransfer before configuration of Asynchronous FIFO mode, then the channel B pins will remain in their \ndefault mode (D7:0=tri -stated but pulled high trough 75K resistor, TX E# =low, RXF# =high. RD# and \nWR# are inputs a nd should be pulled high). An MPSSE command, set_data_bits  can be used to \nconfigure the channel B pins as inputs before configuring channel A as Synchronous FIFO. This avoids the \nchannel B pins driving against any interfaces (such as SPI) which may have be en configured previous to \nany switching of channel A to Synchronous FIFO mode. Refer to AN1121C -01 MPSSE Cmnd  for the \nset_data_bits command and further information on the MPSSE used in MCU Host BUS Emulation mode.  \n \nThe MPSSE can be configured directly using the D2X X commands. Refer to t he \nD2XX_Programmers_Guide .

A USB bus powered \ndevice gets its power from the USB bus. In this application, the FT2232H requires that the VBUS (USB \n+5V) is regulated down to +3.3V (using an LDO) to supply the VCCIO, VPLL, VPHY and VREGIN.  \n \nVREGIN is the +3.3V input to the on chip +1.8V regulator. The output of the on chip LDO regulator \n(+1.8V) driv es the FT2232H core supply (VCORE). This requires a minimum of a 3.3uF filter capacitor.  \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  51  \nFT2232H  Dual High Speed USB to Multipurpose UART/FIFO IC  Datasheet  \nVersion 2.6  \n \nDocument No.: FT_000061    Clearance No.: FTDI#77  \n \nBus Powered Application example 2: Bus powered configuration (with additional 1.8V LDO voltage \nregulator for VCORE)  \nVBUS1\nD-2\nD+3\nGND4100nF100nF\nGND GND4.7uF 4.7uF\nGND GND +1.8V +3.3V100nF 100nF100nF100nF100nF 100nF100nF+1.8V+1.8V+1.8V+3.3V+3.3V+3.3V+3.3V\nGND GND GND GND GND GND GND+3.3V\n+3.3V\n12K1K\nGND+3.3V\nCS1\nSCL2D3Q4\nGND5ORG6\nDU7VCC8\n93C46\nGND GND GND+3.3V+3.3V\n2.2K10K 10K 10K\n1 3\n12MHzEECLK\nEEDATA\nGNDVin Vout\nGNDLDO +1.8V\nGND+1.8V\n100nF\nGND100nF\nGND\n \nGND1OSCI2\nOSCO3VPHY4GND5REF6DM7\nDP8VPLL9\nAGND10GND11 VCORE12\nTEST13RESET #14GND15ADBUS 016\n17\n18\n19\nVCCIO20\n21\n22\n23\n24\nGND2526\n27\n28\n29\n30\nVCCIO31\n32\n33\n34\nGND35SUSPEND #36\nVCORE37\n38\n39\n40\n41\nVCCIO42\n43\n44\n45\n46\nGND4748VREGOUT49VREGIN50GND5152\n53\n54\nVCCIO56\n55\n57\n58\n59\nPWREN #60EECLK62\nEEDATA61EECS63VCORE64\nADBUS 1\nADBUS 2\nADBUS 3\nADBUS 4\nADBUS 5\nADBUS 6\nADBUS 7\nACBUS 0\nACBUS 1\nACBUS 2\nACBUS 3\nACBUS 4\nACBUS 5\nACBUS 6\nACBUS 7\nBDBUS 0\nBDBUS 1\nBDBUS 2\nBDBUS 3\nBDBUS 4\nBDBUS 5\nBDBUS 6\nBDBUS 7\nBCBUS 0\nBCBUS 1\nBCBUS 2\nBCBUS 3\nBCBUS 4\nBCBUS 5\nBCBUS 6\nBCBUS 70?GND\n27pF 27pFVin Vout\nGNDLDO +3.3V\nGND100nF 100nF\nGND GND+3.3V\n \nFigure 6.2 Bus Powered Configuration Example 2  \n \nFigure 6.32 illustrates the FT2232H in a typical USB bus powered configuration similar to Figure 6.1.
