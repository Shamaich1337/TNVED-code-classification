All rights reserved.\nFunctional Description\nThe DDR2 SDRAM uses a double data rate architecture to achieve high-speed opera-\ntion. The double data rate architecture is essentially a 4 n-prefetch architecture, with an\ninterface designed to transfer two data words per clock cycle at the I/O balls. A singleREAD or WRITE operation for the DDR2 SDRAM effectively consists of a single 4 n-bit-\nwide, two-clock-cycle data transfer at the internal DRAM core and four correspondingn-bit-wide, one-half-clock-cycle data transfers at the I/O balls.\nA bidirectional data strobe (DQS, DQS#) is transmitted externally, along with data, for\nuse in data capture at the receiver. DQS is a strobe transmitted by the DDR2 SDRAMduring READs and by the memory controller during WRITEs. DQS is edge-aligned withdata for READs and center-aligned with data for WRITEs. The x16 offering has two datastrobes, one for the lower byte (LDQS, LDQS#) and one for the upper byte (UDQS,UDQS#).\nThe DDR2 SDRAM operates from a differential clock (CK and CK#); the crossing of CK\ngoing HIGH and CK# going LOW will be referred to as the positive edge of CK. Com-mands (address and control signals) are registered at every positive edge of CK. Inputdata is registered on both edges of DQS, and output data is referenced to both edges ofDQS as well as to both edges of CK.\nRead and write accesses to the DDR2 SDRAM are burst-oriented; accesses start at a se-\nlected location and continue for a programmed number of locations in a programmedsequence. Accesses begin with the registration of an ACTIVATE command, which is thenfollowed by a READ or WRITE command. The address bits registered coincident withthe ACTIVATE command are used to select the bank and row to be accessed. The ad-dress bits registered coincident with the READ or WRITE command are used to selectthe bank and the starting column location for the burst access.\nThe DDR2 SDRAM provides for programmable read or write burst lengths of four or\neight locations. DDR2 SDRAM supports interrupting a burst read of eight with anotherread or a burst write of eight with another write. An auto precharge function may be en-abled to provide a self-timed row precharge that is initiated at the end of the burst ac-cess.\nAs with standard DDR SDRAM, the pipelined, multibank architecture of DDR2 SDRAM\nenables concurrent operation, thereby providing high, effective bandwidth by hidingrow precharge and activation time.\nA self refresh mode is provided, along with a power-saving, power-down mode.All inputs are compatible with the JEDEC standard for SSTL_18. All full drive-strength\noutputs are SSTL_18-compatible.\nIndustrial Temperature\nThe industrial temperature (IT) option, if offered, has two simultaneous requirements:ambient temperature surrounding the device cannot be less than –40°C or greater than85°C, and the case temperature cannot be less than –40°C or greater than 95°C. JEDECspecifications require the refresh rate to double when T\nC exceeds 85°C; this also requires\nuse of the high-temperature self refresh option. Additionally, ODT resistance, input/output impedance and I\nDD values must be derated when T C is < 0°C or > 85°C.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nFunctional Description\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

Additionally, the x16 is divided into 2 bytes: the lower byte and the upper byte.For the lower byte (DQ[7:0]), DM refers to LDM and DQS refers to LDQS. For the up-per byte (DQ[15:8]), DM refers to UDM and DQS refers to UDQS.\n• A x16 device\'s DQ bus is comprised of two bytes. If only one of the bytes needs to be\nused, use the lower byte for data transfers and terminate the upper byte as noted:\n– Connect UDQS to ground via 1kȍ * resistor\n– Connect UDQS# to V\nDD via 1kȍ* resistor\n– Connect UDM to V DD via 1kȍ* resistor\n– Connect DQ[15:8] individually to either V SS or V DD via 1kȍ* resistors, or float\nDQ[15:8].\n*If ODT is used, 1kȍ resistor should be changed to 4x that of the selected ODT.\n• Complete functionality is described throughout the document, and any page or dia-\ngram may have been simplified to convey a topic and may not be inclusive of all re-\nquirements.\n• Any specific requirement takes precedence over a general statement.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nFunctional Description\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

A10 sampled during a PRECHARGE com-mand determines whether the PRECHARGE applies to one bank (A10 LOW, bank selected\nby BA[2:0] or all banks (A10 HIGH). The address inputs also provide the op-code during aLOAD MODE command.\nBA[2:0] Input Bank address inputs: BA[2:0] define to which bank an ACTIVATE, READ, WRITE, or PRE-CHARGE command is being applied. BA[2:0] define which mode register, including MR,EMR, EMR(2), and EMR(3), is loaded during the LOAD MODE command.\nCK, CK# Input Clock: CK and CK# are differential clock inputs. All address and control input signals aresampled on the crossing of the positive edge of CK and negative edge of CK#. Outputdata (DQ and DQS/DQS#) is referenced to the crossings of CK and CK#.\nCKE Input Clock enable: CKE (registered HIGH) activates and CKE (registered LOW) deactivatesclocking circuitry on the DDR2 SDRAM. The specific circuitry that is enabled/disabled isdependent on the DDR2 SDRAM configuration and operating mode. CKE LOW providesprecharge power-down and SELF REFRESH operations (all banks idle), or ACTIVATE pow-\ner-down (row active in any bank). CKE is synchronous for power-down entry, power-\ndown exit, output disable, and for self refresh entry. CKE is asynchronous for self refreshexit. Input buffers (excluding CK, CK#, CKE, and ODT) are disabled during power-down.Input buffers (excluding CKE) are disabled during self refresh. CKE is an SSTL_18 inputbut will detect a LVCMOS LOW level after V\nDD is applied during first power-up. After V REF\nhas become stable during the power-on and initialization sequence, it must be main-tained for proper operation of the CKE receiver. For proper SELF REFRESH operation, V\nREF\nmust be maintained.\nCS# Input Chip select: CS# enables (registered LOW) and disables (registered HIGH) the commanddecoder. All commands are masked when CS# is registered high. CS# provides for exter-nal bank selection on systems with multiple ranks. CS# is considered part of the com-mand code.\nLDM, UDM, DM Input Input data mask: DM is an input mask signal for write data. Input data is masked whenDM is sampled HIGH along with that input data during a WRITE access. DM is sampled onboth edges of DQS. Although DM balls are input-only, the DM loading is designed tomatch that of DQ and DQS balls. LDM is DM for lower byte DQ[7:0] and UDM is DM forupper byte DQ[15:8].\nODT Input On-die termination: ODT (registered HIGH) enables termination resistance internal tothe DDR2 SDRAM. When enabled, ODT is only applied to each of the following balls:DQ[15:0], LDM, UDM, LDQS, LDQS#, UDQS, and UDQS# for the x16; DQ[7:0], DQS, DQS#,RDQS, RDQS#, and DM for the x8; DQ[3:0], DQS, DQS#, and DM for the x4. The ODT inputwill be ignored if disabled via the LOAD MODE command.\nRAS#, CAS#, WE# Input Command inputs: RAS#, CAS#, and WE# (along with CS#) define the command beingentered.\nDQ[15:0] (x16)\nDQ[3:0] (x4)DQ[7:0] (x8)I/O Data input/output: Bidirectional data bus for 64 Meg x 16.Bidirectional data bus for 256 Meg x 4.Bidirectional data bus for 128 Meg x 8.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nBall Assignments and Descriptions\nCCMTD-1725822587-9658\n1GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

This is a\nstress rating only, and functional operation of the device at these or any other condi-tions outside those indicated in the operational sections of this specification is not im-plied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affectreliability.\nTable 5: Absolute Maximum DC Ratings\nParameter Symbol Min Max Units Notes\nVDD supply voltage relative to V SS VDD –1.0 2.3 V 1\nVDDQ supply voltage relative to V SSQ VDDQ –0.5 2.3 V 1, 2\nVDDL supply voltage relative to V SSL VDDL –0.5 2.3 V 1\nVoltage on any ball relative to V SS VIN, VOUT –0.5 2.3 V 3\nInput leakage current; any input 0V ื V IN ื V DD; all other\nballs not under test = 0VII –5 5 μA\nOutput leakage current; 0V ื V OUT ื V DDQ; DQ and ODT dis-\nabledIOZ –5 5 μA\nVREF leakage current; V REF = Valid V REF level IVREF –2 2 μA\nNotes: 1.

V REF ื 0.6 × V DDQ; however, V REF may be ุ V DDQ provided that V REF ื 300mV.\n3. Voltage on any I/O may not exceed voltage on V DDQ.\nTemperature and Thermal Impedance\nIt is imperative that the DDR2 SDRAM device’s temperature specifications, shown in Table 6 (page 25), be maintained in order to ensure the junction temperature is in theproper operating range to meet data sheet specifications. An important step in main-taining the proper junction temperature is using the device’s thermal impedances cor-\nrectly. The thermal impedances are listed in Table 7 (page 27) for the applicable andavailable die revision and packages.\nIncorrectly using thermal impedances can produce significant errors. Read Micron\ntechnical note TN-00-08, “Thermal Applications” (see www.micron.com/products/support/technical-notes), prior to using the thermal impedances listed in Table 7. Fordesigns that are expected to last several years and require the flexibility to use severalDRAM die shrinks, consider using final target theta values (rather than existing values)to account for increased thermal impedances from the die size reduction.\nThe DDR2 SDRAM device’s safe junction temperature range can be maintained when\nthe T\nC specification is not exceeded. In applications where the device’s ambient tem-\nperature is too high, use of forced air and/or heat sinks may be required in order to sat-isfy the case temperature specifications.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nElectrical Specifications – Absolute Ratings\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

All voltages are referenced to V SS.\n2. Tests for AC timing, I DD, and electrical AC and DC characteristics may be conducted at nominal reference/supply\nvoltage levels, but the related specifications and the operation of the device are warranted for the full voltage\nrange specified. ODT is disabled for all measurements that are not ODT-specific.\n3. Outputs measured with equivalent load (see Figure 16 (page 52)).\n4. AC timing and I DD tests may use a V IL-to-V IH swing of up to 1.0V in the test environment, and parameter specifica-\ntions are guaranteed for the specified AC input levels under normal use conditions. The slew rate for the input\nsignals used to test the device is 1.0 V/ns for signals in the range between V IL(AC) and V IH(AC) . Slew rates other than\n1.0 V/ns may require the timing parameters to be derated as specified.\n5. The AC and DC input level specifications are as defined in the SSTL_18 standard (that is, the receiver will effective-\nly switch as a result of the signal crossing the AC input level and will remain in that state as long as the signaldoes not ring back above [below] the DC input LOW [HIGH] level).\n6. CK and CK# input slew rate is referenced at 1 V/ns (2 V/ns if measured differentially).\n7. Operating frequency is only allowed to change during self refresh mode (see Figure 79 (page 131)), precharge\npower-down mode, or system reset condition (see Reset (page 132)). SSC allows for small deviations in operating\nfrequency, provided the SSC guidelines are satisfied.\n8. The clock’s \ntCK (AVG) is the average clock over any 200 consecutive clocks and tCK (AVG) MIN is the smallest clock\nrate allowed (except for a deviation due to allowed clock jitter). Input clock jitter is allowed provided it does notexceed values specified. Also, the jitter must be of a random Gaussian distribution in nature.\n9. Spread spectrum is not included in the jitter specification values. However, the input clock can accommodate\nspread spectrum at a sweep rate in the range 8–60 kHz with an additional one percent \ntCK (AVG); however, the\nspread spectrum may not use a clock rate below tCK (AVG) MIN or above tCK (AVG) MAX.\n10. MIN (tCL, tCH) refers to the smaller of the actual clock LOW time and the actual clock HIGH time driven to the\ndevice. The clock’s half period must also be of a Gaussian distribution; tCH (AVG) and tCL (AVG) must be met with\nor without clock jitter and with or without duty cycle jitter. tCH (AVG) and tCL (AVG) are the average of any 200\nconsecutive CK falling edges. tCH limits may be exceeded if the duty cycle jitter is small enough that the absolute\nhalf period limits (tCH [ABS], tCL [ABS]) are not violated.\n11.tHP (MIN) is the lesser of tCL and tCH actually applied to the device CK and CK# inputs; thus, tHP (MIN) ุ the lesser\nof tCL (ABS) MIN and tCH (ABS) MIN.\n12. The period jitter (tJITper) is the maximum deviation in the clock period from the average or nominal clock allowed\nin either the positive or negative direction. JEDEC specifies tighter jitter numbers during DLL locking time. DuringDLL lock time, the jitter values should be 20 percent less those than noted in the table (DLL locked).\n13. The half-period jitter (\ntJITdty) applies to either the high pulse of clock or the low pulse of clock; however, the two\ncumulatively can not exceed tJITper.\n14. The cycle-to-cycle jitter (tJITcc) is the amount the clock period can deviate from one cycle to the next. JEDEC speci-\nfies tighter jitter numbers during DLL locking time. During DLL lock time, the jitter values should be 20 percentless than those noted in the table (DLL locked).\n15. The cumulative jitter error (\ntERR nper), where n is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6–10, or 11–50 is the amount of clock time allowed to\nconsecutively accumulate away from the average clock over any number of clock cycles.\n16. JEDEC specifies using tERR 6–10per  when derating clock-related output timing (see notes 19 and 48). Micron requires\nless derating by allowing tERR 5per to be used.\n17. This parameter is not referenced to a specific voltage level but is specified when the device output is no longer\ndriving (tRPST) or beginning to drive (tRPRE).1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nAC Timing Operating Specifications\nCCMTD-1725822587-9658\n1GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

The inputs to the DRAM must be aligned to the associated clock, that is, the actual clock that latches it in. Howev-\ner, the input timing (in ns) references to the tCK (AVG) when determining the required number of clocks. The fol-\nlowing input parameters are determined by taking the specified percentage times the tCK (AVG) rather than tCK:\ntIPW, tDIPW, tDQSS, tDQSH, tDQSL, tDSS, tDSH, tWPST, and tWPRE.\n19. The DRAM output timing is aligned to the nominal or average clock. Most output parameters must be derated by\nthe actual jitter error when input clock jitter is present; this will result in each parameter becoming larger. The\nfollowing parameters are required to be derated by subtracting tERR 5per (MAX): tAC (MIN), tDQSCK (MIN), tLZDQS\n(MIN), tLZDQ (MIN), tAON (MIN); while the following parameters are required to be derated by subtracting\ntERR 5per (MIN): tAC (MAX), tDQSCK (MAX), tHZ (MAX), tLZDQS (MAX), tLZDQ (MAX), tAON (MAX). The parameter\ntRPRE (MIN) is derated by subtracting tJITper (MAX), while tRPRE (MAX), is derated by subtracting tJITper (MIN).\nThe parameter tRPST (MIN) is derated by subtracting tJITdty (MAX), while tRPST (MAX), is derated by subtracting\ntJITdty (MIN). Output timings that require tERR 5per derating can be observed to have offsets relative to the clock;\nhowever, the total window will not degrade.\n20. When DQS is used single-ended, the minimum limit is reduced by 100ps.\n21.tHZ and tLZ transitions occur in the same access time windows as valid data transitions. These parameters are not\nreferenced to a specific voltage level, but specify when the device output is no longer driving (tHZ) or begins driv-\ning (tLZ).\n22.tLZ (MIN) will prevail over a tDQSCK (MIN) + tRPRE (MAX) condition.\n23. This is not a device limit. The device will operate with a negative value, but system performance could be degra-\nded due to bus turnaround.\n24. It is recommended that DQS be valid (HIGH or LOW) on or before the WRITE command. The case shown (DQS go-\ning from High-Z to logic LOW) applies when no WRITEs were previously in progress on the bus. If a previous\nWRITE was in progress, DQS could be HIGH during this time, depending on tDQSS.\n25. The intent of the “Don’t Care” state after completion of the postamble is that the DQS-driven signal should either\nbe HIGH, LOW, or High-Z, and that any signal transition within the input switching region must follow valid inputrequirements. That is, if DQS transitions HIGH (above V\nIH[DC]min ), then it must not transition LOW (below V IH[DC] )\nprior to tDQSH (MIN).\n26. Referenced to each output group: x4 = DQS with DQ[3:0]; x8 = DQS with DQ[7:0]; x16 = LDQS with DQ[7:0]; and\nUDQS with DQ[15:8].\n27. The data valid window is derived by achieving other specifications: tHP (tCK/2), tDQSQ, and tQH (tQH = tHP - tQHS).\nThe data valid window derates in direct proportion to the clock duty cycle and a practical data valid window canbe derived.\n28.\ntQH = tHP - tQHS; the worst case tQH would be the lesser of tCL (ABS) MAX or tCH (ABS) MAX times tCK (ABS) MIN\n- tQHS. Minimizing the amount of tCH (AVG) offset and value of tJITdty will provide a larger tQH, which in turn\nwill provide a larger valid data out window.\n29. This maximum value is derived from the referenced test load. tHZ (MAX) will prevail over tDQSCK (MAX) + tRPST\n(MAX) condition.\n30. The values listed are for the differential DQS strobe (DQS and DQS#) with a differential slew rate of 2 V/ns (1 V/ns\nfor each signal). There are two sets of values listed: tDSa, tDHa and tDSb, tDHb. The tDSa, tDHa values (for reference\nonly) are equivalent to the baseline values of tDSb, tDHb at V REF when the slew rate is 2 V/ns, differentially. The\nbaseline values, tDSb, tDHb, are the JEDEC-defined values, referenced from the logic trip points. tDSb is referenced\nfrom V IH(AC)  for a rising signal and V IL(AC) for a falling signal, while tDHb is referenced from V IL(DC) for a rising sig-\nnal and V IH(DC)  for a falling signal. If the differential DQS slew rate is not equal to 2 V/ns, then the baseline values\nmust be derated by adding the values from Table 31 (page 65) and Table 32 (page 67). If the DQS differential1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nAC Timing Operating Specifications\nCCMTD-1725822587-9658\n1GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

All rights reserved.\nstrobe feature is not enabled, then the DQS strobe is single-ended and the baseline values must be derated using \nTable 33 (page 68). Single-ended DQS data timing is referenced at DQS crossing V REF. The correct timing values\nfor a single-ended DQS strobe are listed in Table 34 (page 68)–Table 36 (page 69) on Table 34 (page 68), \nTable 35 (page 69), and Table 36 (page 69); listed values are already derated for slew rate variations and con-verted from baseline values to V\nREF values.\n31. V IL/VIH DDR2 overshoot/undershoot. See AC Overshoot/Undershoot Specification (page 58).\n32. For each input signal—not the group collectively.\n33. There are two sets of values listed for command/address: tISa, tIHa and tISb, tIHb. The tISa, tIHa values (for reference\nonly) are equivalent to the baseline values of tISb, tIHb at V REF when the slew rate is 1 V/ns. The baseline values,\ntISb, tIHb, are the JEDEC-defined values, referenced from the logic trip points. tISb is referenced from V IH(AC)  for a\nrising signal and V IL(AC) for a falling signal, while tIHb is referenced from V IL(DC) for a rising signal and V IH(DC)  for a\nfalling signal. If the command/address slew rate is not equal to 1 V/ns, then the baseline values must be derated\nby adding the values from Table 29 (page 61) and Table 30 (page 62).\n34. This is applicable to READ cycles only. WRITE cycles generally require additional time due to tWR during auto pre-\ncharge.\n35. READs and WRITEs with auto precharge are allowed to be issued before tRAS (MIN) is satisfied because tRAS lock-\nout feature is supported in DDR2 SDRAM.\n36. When a single-bank PRECHARGE command is issued, tRP timing applies. tRPA timing applies when the PRE-\nCHARGE (ALL) command is issued, regardless of the number of banks open. For 8-bank devices (ุ1Gb), tRPA (MIN)\n= tRP (MIN) + tCK (AVG) (Table 12 (page 34) lists tRP [MIN] + tCK [AVG] MIN).\n37. This parameter has a two clock minimum requirement at any tCK.\n38. The tFAW (MIN) parameter applies to all 8-bank DDR2 devices. No more than four bank-ACTIVATE commands may\nbe issued in a given tFAW (MIN) period. tRRD (MIN) restriction still applies.\n39. The minimum internal READ-to-PRECHARGE time. This is the time from which the last 4-bit prefetch begins to\nwhen the PRECHARGE command can be issued. A 4-bit prefetch is when the READ command internally latches theREAD so that data will output CL later. This parameter is only applicable when \ntRTP/(2 × tCK) > 1, such as frequen-\ncies faster than 533 MHz when tRTP = 7.5ns. If tRTP/(2 × tCK) ื 1, then equation AL + BL/2 applies. tRAS (MIN) has\nto be satisfied as well. The DDR2 SDRAM will automatically delay the internal PRECHARGE command until tRAS\n(MIN) has been satisfied.\n40.tDAL = (nWR) + (tRP/tCK). Each of these terms, if not already an integer, should be rounded up to the next integer.\ntCK refers to the application clock period; nWR refers to the tWR parameter stored in the MR9–MR11. For exam-\nple, -37E at tCK = 3.75ns with tWR programmed to four clocks would have tDAL = 4 + (15ns/3.75ns) clocks = 4 + (4)\nclocks = 8 clocks.\n41. The refresh period is 64ms (commercial) or 32ms (industrial and automotive). This equates to an average refresh\nrate of 7.8125μs (commercial) or 3.9607μs (industrial and automotive). To ensure all rows of all banks are properlyrefreshed, 8192 REFRESH commands must be issued every 64ms (commercial) or 32ms (industrial and automotive).The JEDEC \ntRFC MAX of 70,000ns is not required as bursting of AUTO REFRESH commands is allowed.\n42.tDELAY is calculated from tIS + tCK + tIH so that CKE registration LOW is guaranteed prior to CK, CK# being re-\nmoved in a system RESET condition (see Reset (page 132)).\n43.tISXR is equal to tIS and is used for CKE setup time during self refresh exit, as shown in Figure 69 (page 123).\n44.tCKE (MIN) of three clocks means CKE must be registered on three consecutive positive clock edges. CKE must re-\nmain at the valid input level the entire time it takes to achieve the three clocks of registration. Thus, after anyCKE transition, CKE may not transition from its valid level during the time period of \ntIS + 2 × tCK + tIH.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nAC Timing Operating Specifications\nCCMTD-1725822587-9658\n1GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

The half-clock of tAOFD’s 2.5 tCK assumes a 50/50 clock duty cycle. This half-clock value must be derated by the\namount of half-clock duty cycle error. For example, if the clock duty cycle was 47/53, tAOFD would actually be 2.5 -\n0.03, or 2.47, for tAOF (MIN) and 2.5 + 0.03, or 2.53, for tAOF (MAX).\n46. ODT turn-on time tAON (MIN) is when the device leaves High-Z and ODT resistance begins to turn on. ODT turn-\non time tAON (MAX) is when the ODT resistance is fully on. Both are measured from tAOND.\n47. ODT turn-off time tAOF (MIN) is when the device starts to turn off ODT resistance. ODT turn off time tAOF (MAX)\nis when the bus is in High-Z. Both are measured from tAOFD.\n48. Half-clock output parameters must be derated by the actual tERR 5per and tJITdty when input clock jitter is present;\nthis will result in each parameter becoming larger. The parameter tAOF (MIN) is required to be derated by sub-\ntracting both tERR 5per (MAX) and tJITdty (MAX). The parameter tAOF (MAX) is required to be derated by subtract-\ning both tERR 5per (MIN) and tJITdty (MIN).\n49. The -187E maximum limit is 2 × tCK + tAC (MAX) + 1000 but it will likely be 3 x tCK + tAC (MAX) + 1000 in the\nfuture.\n50. Should use 8 tCK for backward compatibility.\n51. DRAM devices should be evenly addressed when being accessed. Disproportionate accesses to a particular row ad-\ndress may result in reduction of the product lifetime.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nAC Timing Operating Specifications\nCCMTD-1725822587-9658\n1GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

The slew rate for single-ended inputs is measured from DC level to AC level, V IL(DC) to\nVIH(AC)  on the rising edge and V IL(AC) to V IH(DC)  on the falling edge. For signals referenced\nto V REF, the valid intersection is where the “tangent” line intersects V REF, as shown in \nFigure 25 (page 63), Figure 27 (page 64), Figure 29 (page 70), and Figure 31 (page\n71).\n5.

Example: tIS (total setup time) = tIS (base) + ǻtIS.\ntIS, the nominal slew rate for a rising signal, is defined as the slew rate between the last\ncrossing of V REF(DC)  and the first crossing of V IH(AC)min . Setup nominal slew rate (tIS) for\na falling signal is defined as the slew rate between the last crossing of V REF(DC)  and the\nfirst crossing of V IL(AC)max .\nIf the actual signal is always earlier than the nominal slew rate line between shaded\n“VREF(DC)  to AC region,” use the nominal slew rate for the derating value (Figure 24\n(page 63)).\nIf the actual signal is later than the nominal slew rate line anywhere between the shaded\n“VREF(DC)  to AC region,” the slew rate of a tangent line to the actual signal from the AC\nlevel to DC level is used for the derating value (see Figure 25 (page 63)).\ntIH, the nominal slew rate for a rising signal, is defined as the slew rate between the last\ncrossing of V IL(DC)max  and the first crossing of V REF(DC) . tIH, nominal slew rate for a fall-\ning signal, is defined as the slew rate between the last crossing of V IH(DC)min  and the first\ncrossing of V REF(DC) .\nIf the actual signal is always later than the nominal slew rate line between shaded “DCto V\nREF(DC)  region,” use the nominal slew rate for the derating value (Figure 26 (page\n64)).\nIf the actual signal is earlier than the nominal slew rate line anywhere between shaded\n“DC to V REF(DC)  region,” the slew rate of a tangent line to the actual signal from the DC\nlevel to V REF(DC)  level is used for the derating value (Figure 27 (page 64)).\nAlthough the total setup time might be negative for slow slew rates (a valid input signalwill not have reached V\nIH[AC] /VIL[AC]  at the time of the rising clock transition), a valid in-\nput signal is still required to complete the transition and reach V IH(AC) /VIL(AC) .\nFor slew rates in between the values listed in Table 29 (page 61) and Table 30 (page62), the derating values may obtained by linear interpolation.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nInput Slew Rate Derating\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

For READ with auto pre-charge, the precharge period is defined as if the same burst wasexecuted with auto precharge disabled and then followed withthe earliest possible PRECHARGE command that still accesses allof the data in the burst. For WRITE with auto precharge, theprecharge period begins when \ntWR ends, with tWR measured as\nif auto precharge was disabled. The access period starts withregistration of the command and ends where the precharge pe-riod (or \ntRP) begins. This device supports concurrent auto pre-\ncharge such that when a READ with auto precharge is enabledor a WRITE with auto precharge is enabled, any command toother banks is allowed, as long as that command does not inter-rupt the read or write data transfer already in process. In eithercase, all other related limitations apply (contention betweenread data and write data must be avoided).\nThe minimum delay from a READ or WRITE command with auto precharge enabled toa command to a different bank is summarized in Table 40 (page 78).\n4.

The DDR2 SDRAM is effectively deselected. Operations already inprogress are not affected. DESELECT is also referred to as COMMAND INHIBIT.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nCommands\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev. AB 09/18 EN 78Micron Technology, Inc. reserves the right to change products or specifications without notice.\n© 2007 Micron Technology, Inc. All rights reserved.\nNO OPERATION (NOP)\nThe NO OPERATION (NOP) command is used to instruct the selected DDR2 SDRAM to\nperform a NOP (CS# is LOW; RAS#, CAS#, and WE are HIGH). This prevents unwantedcommands from being registered during idle or wait states. Operations already in pro-gress are not affected.\nLOAD MODE (LM)\nThe mode registers are loaded via bank address and address inputs. The bank addressballs determine which mode register will be programmed. See Mode Register (MR)(page 81). The LM command can only be issued when all banks are idle, and a subse-quent executable command cannot be issued until \ntMRD is met.\nACTIVATE\nThe ACTIVATE command is used to open (or activate) a row in a particular bank for asubsequent access. The value on the bank address inputs determines the bank, and theaddress inputs select the row. This row remains active (or open) for accesses until a pre-charge command is issued to that bank. A precharge command must be issued beforeopening a different row in the same bank.\nREAD\nThe READ command is used to initiate a burst read access to an active row. The valueon the bank address inputs determine the bank, and the address provided on addressinputs A0–Ai (where Ai is the most significant column address bit for a given configura-tion) selects the starting column location. The value on input A10 determines whetheror not auto precharge is used. If auto precharge is selected, the row being accessed willbe precharged at the end of the read burst; if auto precharge is not selected, the row willremain open for subsequent accesses.\nDDR2 SDRAM also supports the AL feature, which allows a READ or WRITE command\nto be issued prior to \ntRCD (MIN) by delaying the actual registration of the READ/WRITE\ncommand to the internal device by AL clock cycles.\nWRITE\nThe WRITE command is used to initiate a burst write access to an active row. The valueon the bank select inputs selects the bank, and the address provided on inputs A0–A i\n(where Ai is the most significant column address bit for a given configuration) selectsthe starting column location. The value on input A10 determines whether or not autoprecharge is used. If auto precharge is selected, the row being accessed will be pre-charged at the end of the WRITE burst; if auto precharge is not selected, the row willremain open for subsequent accesses.\nDDR2 SDRAM also supports the AL feature, which allows a READ or WRITE command\nto be issued prior to \ntRCD (MIN) by delaying the actual registration of the READ/WRITE\ncommand to the internal device by AL clock cycles.\nInput data appearing on the DQ is written to the memory array subject to the DM input\nlogic level appearing coincident with the data. If a given DM signal is registered LOW,the corresponding data will be written to memory; if the DM signal is registered HIGH,the corresponding data inputs will be ignored, and a WRITE will not be executed to thatbyte/column location (see Figure 66 (page 118)).1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nCommands\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev. AB 09/18 EN 79Micron Technology, Inc. reserves the right to change products or specifications without notice.\n© 2007 Micron Technology, Inc. All rights reserved.\nPRECHARGE\nThe PRECHARGE command is used to deactivate the open row in a particular bank or\nthe open row in all banks. The bank(s) will be available for a subsequent row activationa specified time (\ntRP) after the PRECHARGE command is issued, except in the case of\nconcurrent auto precharge, where a READ or WRITE command to a different bank is al-lowed as long as it does not interrupt the data transfer in the current bank and does notviolate any other timing parameters. After a bank has been precharged, it is in the idlestate and must be activated prior to any READ or WRITE commands being issued tothat bank. A PRECHARGE command is allowed if there is no open row in that bank (idlestate) or if the previously open row is already in the process of precharging. However,the precharge period will be determined by the last PRECHARGE command issued tothe bank.\nREFRESH\nREFRESH is used during normal operation of the DDR2 SDRAM and is analogous to\nCAS#-before-RAS# (CBR) REFRESH. All banks must be in the idle mode prior to issuinga REFRESH command. This command is nonpersistent, so it must be issued each timea refresh is required. The addressing is generated by the internal refresh controller. Thismakes the address bits a “Don’t Care” during a REFRESH command.\nSELF REFRESH\nThe SELF REFRESH command can be used to retain data in the DDR2 SDRAM, even ifthe rest of the system is powered down. When in the self refresh mode, the DDR2SDRAM retains data without external clocking. All power supply inputs (including Vref)must be maintained at valid levels upon entry/exit and during SELF REFRESH opera-tion.\nThe SELF REFRESH command is initiated like a REFRESH command except CKE is\nLOW. The DLL is automatically disabled upon entering self refresh and is automaticallyenabled upon exiting self refresh.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nCommands\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

All rights reserved.\nMode Register (MR)\nThe mode register is used to define the specific mode of operation of the DDR2 SDRAM.\nThis definition includes the selection of a burst length, burst type, CAS latency, operat-ing mode, DLL RESET, write recovery, and power-down mode, as shown in Figure 36(page 82). Contents of the mode register can be altered by re-executing the LOADMODE (LM) command. If the user chooses to modify only a subset of the MR variables,all variables must be programmed when the command is issued.\nThe MR is programmed via the LM command and will retain the stored information un-\ntil it is programmed again or until the device loses power (except for bit M8, which isself-clearing). Reprogramming the mode register will not alter the contents of the mem-ory array, provided it is performed correctly.\nThe LM command can only be issued (or reissued) when all banks are in the precharged\nstate (idle state) and no bursts are in progress. The controller must wait the specifiedtime \ntMRD before initiating any subsequent operations such as an ACTIVATE com-\nmand. Violating either of these requirements will result in an unspecified operation.\nBurst Length\nBurst length is defined by bits M0–M2, as shown in Figure 36. Read and write accessesto the DDR2 SDRAM are burst-oriented, with the burst length being programmable toeither four or eight. The burst length determines the maximum number of column loca-tions that can be accessed for a given READ or WRITE command.\nWhen a READ or WRITE command is issued, a block of columns equal to the burst\nlength is effectively selected. All accesses for that burst take place within this block,meaning that the burst will wrap within the block if a boundary is reached. The block isuniquely selected by A2–Ai when BL = 4 and by A3–Ai when BL = 8 (where Ai is the mostsignificant column address bit for a given configuration). The remaining (least signifi-cant) address bit(s) is (are) used to select the starting location within the block. The pro-grammed burst length applies to both read and write bursts.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nMode Register (MR)\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

All rights reserved.\nBurst Type\nAccesses within a given burst may be programmed to be either sequential or inter-\nleaved. The burst type is selected via bit M3, as shown in Figure 36. The ordering of ac-cesses within a burst is determined by the burst length, the burst type, and the startingcolumn address, as shown in Table 41. DDR2 SDRAM supports 4-bit burst mode and 8-bit burst mode only. For 8-bit burst mode, full interleaved address ordering is suppor-ted; however, sequential address ordering is nibble-based.\nTable 41: Burst Definition\nBurst Length Starting Column Address\n(A2, A1, A0)Order of Accesses Within a Burst\nBurst Type = Sequential Burst Type = Interleaved\n4 0 0 0 0, 1, 2, 3 0, 1, 2, 3\n0 0 1 1, 2, 3, 0 1, 0, 3, 2\n0 1 0 2, 3, 0, 1 2, 3, 0, 10 1 1 3, 0, 1, 2 3, 2, 1, 0\n8 0 0 0 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n0 0 1 1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 6, 7, 4 1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 60 1 0 2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 4, 5 2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 4, 50 1 1 3, 0, 1, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 6, 5, 41 0 0 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 31 0 1 5, 6, 7, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0 5, 4, 7, 6, 1, 0, 3, 21 1 0 6, 7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1 6, 7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 11 1 1 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 0, 1, 2 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0\nOperating Mode\nThe normal operating mode is selected by issuing a command with bit M7 set to “0,”\nand all other bits set to the desired values, as shown in Figure 36 (page 82). When bit M7is “1,” no other bits of the mode register are programmed. Programming bit M7 to “1”places the DDR2 SDRAM into a test mode that is only used by the manufacturer andshould not be used. No operation or functionality is guaranteed if M7 bit is “1.”\nDLL RESET\nDLL RESET is defined by bit M8, as shown in Figure 36. Programming bit M8 to “1” willactivate the DLL RESET function. Bit M8 is self-clearing, meaning it returns back to avalue of “0” after the DLL RESET function has been issued.\nAnytime the DLL RESET function is used, 200 clock cycles must occur before a READ\ncommand can be issued to allow time for the internal clock to be synchronized with theexternal clock. Failing to wait for synchronization to occur may result in a violation ofthe \ntAC or tDQSCK parameters.\nWrite Recovery\nWrite recovery (WR) time is defined by bits M9–M11, as shown in Figure 36 (page 82).The WR register is used by the DDR2 SDRAM during WRITE with auto precharge opera-tion. During WRITE with auto precharge operation, the DDR2 SDRAM delays the inter-1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nMode Register (MR)\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

All rights reserved.\nnal auto precharge operation by WR clocks (programmed in bits M9–M11) from the last\ndata burst. An example of WRITE with auto precharge is shown in Figure 65 (page 117).\nWR values of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 clocks may be used for programming bits M9–M11. The\nuser is required to program the value of WR, which is calculated by dividing tWR (in\nnanoseconds) by tCK (in nanoseconds) and rounding up a noninteger value to the next\ninteger; WR (cycles) = tWR (ns)/tCK (ns). Reserved states should not be used as an un-\nknown operation or incompatibility with future versions may result.\nPower-Down Mode\nActive power-down (PD) mode is defined by bit M12, as shown in Figure 36. PD modeenables the user to determine the active power-down mode, which determines per-formance versus power savings. PD mode bit M12 does not apply to precharge PDmode.\nWhen bit M12 = 0, standard active PD mode, or “fast-exit” active PD mode, is enabled.\nThe \ntXARD parameter is used for fast-exit active PD exit timing. The DLL is expected to\nbe enabled and running during this mode.\nWhen bit M12 = 1, a lower-power active PD mode, or “slow-exit” active PD mode, is en-\nabled. The tXARDS parameter is used for slow-exit active PD exit timing. The DLL can\nbe enabled but “frozen” during active PD mode because the exit-to-READ commandtiming is relaxed. The power difference expected between I\nDD3P  normal and I DD3P  low-\npower mode is defined in the DDR2 I DD Specifications and Conditions table.\nCAS Latency (CL)\nThe CAS latency (CL) is defined by bits M4–M6, as shown in Figure 36 (page 82). CL isthe delay, in clock cycles, between the registration of a READ command and the availa-bility of the first bit of output data. The CL can be set to 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 clocks, dependingon the speed grade option being used.\nDDR2 SDRAM does not support any half-clock latencies. Reserved states should not be\nused as an unknown operation otherwise incompatibility with future versions may re-sult.\nDDR2 SDRAM also supports a feature called posted CAS additive latency (AL). This fea-\nture allows the READ command to be issued prior to \ntRCD (MIN) by delaying the inter-\nnal command to the DDR2 SDRAM by AL clocks. The AL feature is described in furtherdetail in Posted CAS Additive Latency (AL) (page 88).\nExamples of CL = 3 and CL = 4 are shown in Figure 37; both assume AL = 0. If a READ\ncommand is registered at clock edge n, and the CL is m clocks, the data will be availablenominally coincident with clock edge n + m (this assumes AL = 0).1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nMode Register (MR)\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

These func-tions are controlled via the bits shown in Figure 38. The EMR is programmed via the LMcommand and will retain the stored information until it is programmed again or the de-vice loses power. Reprogramming the EMR will not alter the contents of the memory ar-ray, provided it is performed correctly.\nThe EMR must be loaded when all banks are idle and no bursts are in progress, and the\ncontroller must wait the specified time \ntMRD before initiating any subsequent opera-\ntion. Violating either of these requirements could result in an unspecified operation.\nFigure 38: EMR Definition\nDLL Posted CAS# RTTOutA9 A7 A6 A5 A4 A3A8 A2 A1 A0\nExtended mode \nregister (Ex)Address bus\n97 6 5 4 3 82 1 0A10 A12 BA0 BA1\n10 11 12 n\n0 14\nE1\n0\n1Output Drive Strength\nFull\nReduced\nPosted CAS# Additive Latency (AL)3\n01234\n5\n6\nReservedE3\n01010\n1\n01E4\n00110\n0\n11E5\n00001\n1\n11 \n01DLL Enable\nEnable (normal)\nDisable (test/debug)E015\nE11\n0\n1RDQS Enable\nNo\nYesOCD ProgramAn2\nODS RTTDQS#\nE10\n01DQS# Enable\nEnable\nDisableRDQS\nRTT (Nominal)\nRTT disabled\n75\x9f\n150\x9f\n50\x9fE2\n0\n101E6\n0011 \n0\n1OutputsEnabled\nDisabledE12\n \n0\n101Mode Register Set\nMode register (MR)\nExtended mode register (EMR)\nExtended mode register (EMR2)Extended mode register (EMR3)E15\n0011E14MRSBA21\n16\n0 \nOCD Operation4\nOCD exit \nReserved\nReservedReservedEnable OCD defaultsE7\n0\n1\n001E8\n0\n0\n101E9\n0\n0\n011\nNotes: 1.

As detailed in the Initialization section notes, during initialization of the OCD operation,\nall three bits must be set to 1 for the OCD default state, then set to 0 before initializa-\ntion is finished.\nDLL Enable/Disable\nThe DLL may be enabled or disabled by programming bit E0 during the LM command,\nas shown in Figure 38 (page 86). These specifications are applicable when the DLL is en-abled for normal operation. DLL enable is required during power-up initialization andupon returning to normal operation after having disabled the DLL for the purpose ofdebugging or evaluation. Enabling the DLL should always be followed by resetting theDLL using the LM command.\nThe DLL is automatically disabled when entering SELF REFRESH operation and is auto-\nmatically re-enabled and reset upon exit of SELF REFRESH operation.\nAnytime the DLL is enabled (and subsequently reset), 200 clock cycles must occur be-\nfore a READ command can be issued to allow time for the internal clock to synchronizewith the external clock. Failing to wait for synchronization to occur may result in a vio-lation of the \ntAC or tDQSCK parameters.\nAnytime the DLL is disabled and the device is operated below 25 MHz, any AUTO RE-FRESH command should be followed by a PRECHARGE ALL command.\nOutput Drive Strength\nThe output drive strength is defined by bit E1, as shown in Figure 38. The normal drivestrength for all outputs is specified to be SSTL_18. Programming bit E1 = 0 selects nor-mal (full strength) drive strength for all outputs. Selecting a reduced drive strength op-tion (E1 = 1) will reduce all outputs to approximately 45 to 60 percent of the SSTL_18drive strength. This option is intended for the support of lighter load and/or point-to-point environments.\nDQS# Enable/Disable\nThe DQS# ball is enabled by bit E10. When E10 = 0, DQS# is the complement of the dif-ferential data strobe pair DQS/DQS#. When disabled (E10 = 1), DQS is used in a single-ended mode and the DQS# ball is disabled. When disabled, DQS# should be left float-ing; however, it may be tied to ground via a 20 ȍ to 10kȍ resistor. This function is also\nused to enable/disable RDQS#. If RDQS is enabled (E11 = 1) and DQS# is enabled (E10 =0), then both DQS# and RDQS# will be enabled.\nRDQS Enable/Disable\nThe RDQS ball is enabled by bit E11, as shown in Figure 38. This feature is only applica-ble to the x8 configuration. When enabled (E11 = 1), RDQS is identical in function andtiming to data strobe DQS during a READ. During a WRITE operation, RDQS is ignoredby the DDR2 SDRAM.\nOutput Enable/Disable\nThe OUTPUT ENABLE function is defined by bit E12, as shown in Figure 38. When ena-bled (E12 = 0), all outputs (DQ, DQS, DQS#, RDQS, RDQS#) function normally. Whendisabled (E12 = 1), all outputs (DQ, DQS, DQS#, RDQS, RDQS#) are disabled, thus re-1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nExtended Mode Register (EMR)\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

The output disable feature is intended to be used during\nIDD characterization of read current.\nOn-Die Termination (ODT)\nODT effective resistance, R TT(EFF) , is defined by bits E2 and E6 of the EMR, as shown in \nFigure 38 (page 86). The ODT feature is designed to improve signal integrity of thememory channel by allowing the DDR2 SDRAM controller to independently turn on/offODT for any or all devices. R\nTT effective resistance values of 50ȍ, 75ȍ, and 150ȍ  are se-\nlectable and apply to each DQ, DQS/DQS#, RDQS/RDQS#, UDQS/UDQS#, LDQS/LDQS#, DM, and UDM/LDM signal. Bits (E6, E2) determine what ODT resistance is en-abled by turning on/off sw1, sw2, or sw3. The ODT effective resistance value is selectedby enabling switch sw1, which enables all R1 values that are 150ȍ each, enabling an ef-fective resistance of 75ȍ (R\nTT2 [EFF]  = R2/2). Similarly, if sw2 is enabled, all R2 values that\nare 300ȍ  each, enable an effective ODT resistance of 150ȍ (R TT2[EFF]  = R2/2). Switch sw3\nenables R1 values of 100ȍ, enabling effective resistance of 50ȍ. Reserved states shouldnot be used, as an unknown operation or incompatibility with future versions may re-sult.\nThe ODT control ball is used to determine when R\nTT(EFF)  is turned on and off, assuming\nODT has been enabled via bits E2 and E6 of the EMR. The ODT feature and ODT input\nball are only used during active, active power-down (both fast-exit and slow-exitmodes), and precharge power-down modes of operation.\nODT must be turned off prior to entering self refresh mode. During power-up and initi-\nalization of the DDR2 SDRAM, ODT should be disabled until the EMR command is is-sued. This will enable the ODT feature, at which point the ODT ball will determine theR\nTT(EFF)  value. Anytime the EMR enables the ODT function, ODT may not be driven\nHIGH until eight clocks after the EMR has been enabled (see Figure 81 (page 135) forODT timing diagrams).\nOff-Chip Driver (OCD) Impedance Calibration\nThe OFF-CHIP DRIVER function is an optional DDR2 JEDEC feature not supported byMicron and thereby must be set to the default state. Enabling OCD beyond the defaultsettings will alter the I/O drive characteristics and the timing and output I/O specifica-tions will no longer be valid (see Initialization section for proper setting of OCD de-faults).\nPosted CAS Additive Latency (AL)\nPosted CAS additive latency (AL) is supported to make the command and data bus effi-cient for sustainable bandwidths in DDR2 SDRAM. Bits E3–E5 define the value of AL, asshown in Figure 38. Bits E3–E5 allow the user to program the DDR2 SDRAM with an ALof 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 clocks. Reserved states should not be used as an unknown opera-tion or incompatibility with future versions may result.\nIn this operation, the DDR2 SDRAM allows a READ or WRITE command to be issued\nprior to \ntRCD (MIN) with the requirement that AL \x94 tRCD (MIN). A typical application\nusing this feature would set AL = tRCD (MIN) - 1 × tCK.

Applying power; if CKE is maintained below 0.2 × V DDQ, outputs remain disabled. To\nguarantee R TT (ODT resistance) is off, V REF must be valid and a low level must be applied\nto the ODT ball (all other inputs may be undefined; I/Os and outputs must be less than\nVDDQ during voltage ramp time to avoid DDR2 SDRAM device latch-up). V TT is not ap-\nplied directly to the device; however, tVTD should be ุ0 to avoid device latch-up. At\nleast one of the following two sets of conditions (A or B) must be met to obtain a stablesupply state (stable supply defined as V\nDD, VDDL, VDDQ, VREF, and V TT are between their\nminimum and maximum values as stated in Table 13 (page 46)):\nA. Single power source: The V DD voltage ramp from 300mV to V DD,min  must take no lon-\nger than 200ms; during the V DD voltage ramp, |V DD - VDDQ| ื 0.3V.

CKE requires LVCMOS input levels prior to state T0 to ensure DQs are High-Z during de-\nvice power-up prior to V REF being stable. After state T0, CKE is required to have SSTL_18\ninput levels. Once CKE transitions to a high level, it must stay HIGH for the duration of\nthe initialization sequence.\n3.

This is accomplished via the ACTIVATE command, which selects both the bankand the row to be activated.\nAfter a row is opened with an ACTIVATE command, a READ or WRITE command may\nbe issued to that row subject to the \ntRCD specification. tRCD (MIN) should be divided\nby the clock period and rounded up to the next whole number to determine the earliestclock edge after the ACTIVATE command on which a READ or WRITE command can beentered. The same procedure is used to convert other specification limits from timeunits to clock cycles. For example, a \ntRCD (MIN) specification of 20ns with a 266 MHz\nclock (tCK = 3.75ns) results in 5.3 clocks, rounded up to 6. This is shown in Figure 44,\nwhich covers any case where 5 < tRCD (MIN)/tCK \x94  6. Figure 44 also shows the case for\ntRRD where 2 < tRRD (MIN)/tCK \x94  3.\nFigure 44: Example: Meeting tRRD (MIN) and tRCD (MIN)\nCommand\nDon’t CareT1 T0 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7\ntRRDtRRDRow Row Col\nBank x Bank yRow\nBank z Bank yNOP ACT NOP NOP ACT NOP NOP RD/WR\ntRCDCK#\nAddress\nBank addressCKT8 T9\nNOP NOP\nA subsequent ACTIVATE command to a different row in the same bank can only be is-sued after the previous active row has been closed (precharged). The minimum time in-terval between successive ACTIVATE commands to the same bank is defined by \ntRC.\nA subsequent ACTIVATE command to another bank can be issued while the first bank isbeing accessed, which results in a reduction of total row-access overhead. The mini-mum time interval between successive ACTIVATE commands to different banks is de-fined by \ntRRD.\nDDR2 devices with 8 banks (1Gb or larger) have an additional requirement: tFAW. This\nrequires no more than four ACTIVATE commands may be issued in any given tFAW\n(MIN) period, as shown in Figure 45 (page 96).1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nACTIVATE\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

The starting column and bank ad-\ndresses are provided with the READ command, and auto precharge is either enabled ordisabled for that burst access. If auto precharge is enabled, the row being accessed isautomatically precharged at the completion of the burst. If auto precharge is disabled,the row will be left open after the completion of the burst.\nDuring READ bursts, the valid data-out element from the starting column address will\nbe available READ latency (RL) clocks later. RL is defined as the sum of AL and CL: RL =AL + CL. The value for AL and CL are programmable via the MR and EMR commands,respectively. Each subsequent data-out element will be valid nominally at the next posi-tive or negative clock edge (at the next crossing of CK and CK#). Figure 46 (page 98)shows examples of RL based on different AL and CL settings.\nDQS/DQS# is driven by the DDR2 SDRAM along with output data. The initial LOW state\non DQS and the HIGH state on DQS# are known as the read preamble (\ntRPRE). The\nLOW state on DQS and the HIGH state on DQS# coincident with the last data-out ele-ment are known as the read postamble (\ntRPST).\nUpon completion of a burst, assuming no other commands have been initiated, the DQwill go High-Z. A detailed explanation of \ntDQSQ (valid data-out skew), tQH (data-out\nwindow hold), and the valid data window are depicted in Figure 55 (page 106) and Fig-ure 56 (page 107). A detailed explanation of \ntDQSCK (DQS transition skew to CK) and\ntAC (data-out transition skew to CK) is shown in Figure 57 (page 108).\nData from any READ burst may be concatenated with data from a subsequent READcommand to provide a continuous flow of data. The first data element from the newburst follows the last element of a completed burst. The new READ command should beissued x cycles after the first READ command, where x equals BL/2 cycles (see Figure 47(page 99)).\nNonconsecutive read data is illustrated in Figure 48 (page 100). Full-speed random read\naccesses within a page (or pages) can be performed. DDR2 SDRAM supports the use ofconcurrent auto precharge timing (see Table 42 (page 103)).\nDDR2 SDRAM does not allow interrupting or truncating of any READ burst using BL = 4\noperations. Once the BL = 4 READ command is registered, it must be allowed to com-plete the entire READ burst. However, a READ (with auto precharge disabled) using BL =8 operation may be interrupted and truncated only by another READ burst as long asthe interruption occurs on a 4-bit boundary due to the 4n prefetch architecture ofDDR2 SDRAM. As shown in Figure 49 (page 101), READ burst BL = 8 operations maynot be interrupted or truncated with any other command except another READ com-mand.\nData from any READ burst must be completed before a subsequent WRITE burst is al-\nlowed. An example of a READ burst followed by a WRITE burst is shown in Figure 50(page 101). The \ntDQSS (NOM) case is shown (tDQSS [MIN] and tDQSS [MAX] are de-\nfined in Figure 58 (page 110)).1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nREAD\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

The DDR2 SDRAM starts an auto precharge operation on the rising clockedge that is AL + (BL/2) cycles later than the read with auto precharge command provi-ded \ntRAS (MIN) and tRTP are satisfied. If tRAS (MIN) is not satisfied at this rising clock\nedge, the start point of the auto precharge operation will be delayed until tRAS (MIN) is\nsatisfied. If tRTP (MIN) is not satisfied at this rising clock edge, the start point of the au-\nto precharge operation will be delayed until tRTP (MIN) is satisfied. When the internal\nprecharge is pushed out by tRTP , tRP starts at the point where the internal precharge\nhappens (not at the next rising clock edge after this event).\nWhen BL = 4, the minimum time from READ with auto precharge to the next ACTIVATE\ncommand is AL + (tRTP + tRP)/tCK. When BL = 8, the minimum time from READ with\nauto precharge to the next ACTIVATE command is AL + 2 clocks + (tRTP + tRP)/tCK. The\nterm (tRTP + tRP)/tCK is always rounded up to the next integer. A general purpose equa-\ntion can also be used: AL + BL/2 - 2CK + (tRTP + tRP)/tCK. In any event, the internal pre-\ncharge does not start earlier than two clocks after the last 4-bit prefetch.\nREAD with auto precharge command may be applied to one bank while another bank is\noperational. This is referred to as concurrent auto precharge operation, as noted in Ta-ble 42. Examples of READ with precharge and READ with auto precharge with applica-ble timing requirements are shown in Figure 53 (page 104) and Figure 54 (page 105),respectively.\nTable 42: READ Using Concurrent Auto Precharge\nFrom Command (Bank n) To Command (Bank m)Minimum Delay\n(with Concurrent Auto Precharge) Units\nREAD with auto precharge READ or READ with auto precharge BL/2tCK\nWRITE or WRITE with auto precharge (BL/2) + 2tCK\nPRECHARGE or ACTIVATE 1tCK1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nREAD\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

The starting column andbank addresses are provided with the WRITE command, and auto precharge is eitherenabled or disabled for that access. If auto precharge is enabled, the row being accessedis precharged at the completion of the burst.\nNote: For the WRITE commands used in the following illustrations, auto precharge is\ndisabled.\nDuring WRITE bursts, the first valid data-in element will be registered on the first rising\nedge of DQS following the WRITE command, and subsequent data elements will be reg-istered on successive edges of DQS. The LOW state on DQS between the WRITE com-mand and the first rising edge is known as the write preamble; the LOW state on DQSfollowing the last data-in element is known as the write postamble.\nThe time between the WRITE command and the first rising DQS edge is WL ±\ntDQSS.\nSubsequent DQS positive rising edges are timed, relative to the associated clock edge, as\n±tDQSS. tDQSS is specified with a relatively wide range (25% of one clock cycle). All of\nthe WRITE diagrams show the nominal case, and where the two extreme cases (tDQSS\n[MIN] and tDQSS [MAX]) might not be intuitive, they have also been included. Figure 58\n(page 110) shows the nominal case and the extremes of tDQSS for BL = 4. Upon com-\npletion of a burst, assuming no other commands have been initiated, the DQ will re-main High-Z and any additional input data will be ignored.\nData for any WRITE burst may be concatenated with a subsequent WRITE command to\nprovide continuous flow of input data. The first data element from the new burst is ap-plied after the last element of a completed burst. The new WRITE command should beissued x cycles after the first WRITE command, where x equals BL/2.\nFigure 59 (page 111) shows concatenated bursts of BL = 4 and how full-speed randomwrite accesses within a page or pages can be performed. An example of nonconsecutiveWRITEs is shown in Figure 60 (page 111). DDR2 SDRAM supports concurrent auto pre-charge options, as shown in Table 43.\nDDR2 SDRAM does not allow interrupting or truncating any WRITE burst using BL = 4\noperation. Once the BL = 4 WRITE command is registered, it must be allowed to com-plete the entire WRITE burst cycle. However, a WRITE BL = 8 operation (with auto pre-charge disabled) might be interrupted and truncated only by another WRITE burst aslong as the interruption occurs on a 4-bit boundary due to the 4n-prefetch architecture\nof DDR2 SDRAM. WRITE burst BL = 8 operations may not be interrupted or truncated\nwith any command except another WRITE command, as shown in Figure 61 (page113).\nData for any WRITE burst may be followed by a subsequent READ command. To follow\na WRITE, \ntWTR should be met, as shown in Figure 62 (page 114). The number of clock\ncycles required to meet tWTR is either 2 or tWTR/tCK, whichever is greater. Data for any\nWRITE burst may be followed by a subsequent PRECHARGE command. tWR must be\nmet, as shown in Figure 63 (page 115). tWR starts at the end of the data burst, regardless\nof the data mask condition.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nWRITE\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

Precharge will deacti-vate the open row in a particular bank or the open row in all banks. The PRECHARGEoperation is shown in the previous READ and WRITE operation sections.\nDuring a manual PRECHARGE command, the A10 input determines whether one or all\nbanks are to be precharged. In the case where only one bank is to be precharged, bankaddress inputs determine the bank to be precharged. When all banks are to be pre-charged, the bank address inputs are treated as “Don’t Care.”\nOnce a bank has been precharged, it is in the idle state and must be activated prior to\nany READ or WRITE commands being issued to that bank. When a single-bank PRE-CHARGE command is issued, \ntRP timing applies. When the PRECHARGE (ALL) com-\nmand is issued, tRPA timing applies, regardless of the number of banks opened.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nPRECHARGE\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

The refresh period begins when the REFRESH command is registered and ends\ntRFC (MIN) later. The average interval must be reduced to 3.9μs (MAX) when T C exceeds\n85°C.\nFigure 68: Refresh Mode\nCKCK#\nCommand NOP1 NOP1 NOP1 PRECKE\nRA Address\nA10\nBank Bank(s)3BAREF NOP1 REF2 NOP1ACT NOP1\nOne bankAll bankstCK tCH tCL\nRA\nDQ4\nDM4DQS, DQS# 4\ntRFC2 tRP tRFC (MIN)T0T1 T2 T3 T4 Ta0 Tb0 Ta1 Tb1 Tb2\nDon’t CareIndicates a break in time scale\nNotes: 1.

The differential clock\nshould remain stable and meet tCKE specifications at least 1 × tCK after entering self re-\nfresh mode. The procedure for exiting self refresh requires a sequence of commands.First, the differential clock must be stable and meet \ntCK specifications at least 1 × tCK\nprior to CKE going back to HIGH. Once CKE is HIGH (tCKE [MIN] has been satisfied\nwith three clock registrations), the DDR2 SDRAM must have NOP or DESELECT com-mands issued for \ntXSNR. A simple algorithm for meeting both refresh and DLL require-\nments is used to apply NOP or DESELECT commands for 200 clock cycles before apply-ing any other command.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nSELF REFRESH\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

All rights reserved.\nPower-Down Mode\nDDR2 SDRAM supports multiple power-down modes that allow significant power sav-\nings over normal operating modes. CKE is used to enter and exit different power-downmodes. Power-down entry and exit timings are shown in Figure 70 (page 125). Detailedpower-down entry conditions are shown in Figure 71 (page 127)–Figure 78 (page 130). Table 44 (page 126) is the CKE Truth Table.\nDDR2 SDRAM requires CKE to be registered HIGH (active) at all times that an access is\nin progress—from the issuing of a READ or WRITE command until completion of theburst. Thus, a clock suspend is not supported. For READs, a burst completion is definedwhen the read postamble is satisfied; for WRITEs, a burst completion is defined whenthe write postamble and \ntWR (WRITE-to-PRECHARGE command) or tWTR (WRITE-to-\nREAD command) are satisfied, as shown in Figure 73 (page 128) and Figure 74 (page128) on Figure 74 (page 128). The number of clock cycles required to meet \ntWTR is ei-\nther two or tWTR/tCK, whichever is greater.\nPower-down mode (see Figure 70 (page 125)) is entered when CKE is registered low co-incident with an NOP or DESELECT command. CKE is not allowed to go LOW during amode register or extended mode register command time, or while a READ or WRITE op-eration is in progress. If power-down occurs when all banks are idle, this mode is refer-red to as precharge power-down. If power-down occurs when there is a row active inany bank, this mode is referred to as active power-down. Entering power-down deacti-vates the input and output buffers, excluding CK, CK#, ODT, and CKE. For maximumpower savings, the DLL is frozen during precharge power-down. Exiting active power-down requires the device to be at the same voltage and frequency as when it enteredpower-down. Exiting precharge power-down requires the device to be at the same volt-age as when it entered power-down; however, the clock frequency is allowed to change(see Precharge Power-Down Clock Frequency Change (page 131)).\nThe maximum duration for either active or precharge power-down is limited by the re-\nfresh requirements of the device \ntRFC (MAX). The minimum duration for power-down\nentry and exit is limited by the tCKE (MIN) parameter. The following must be main-\ntained while in power-down mode: CKE LOW, a stable clock signal, and stable powersupply signals at the inputs of the DDR2 SDRAM. All other input signals are “Don’tCare” except ODT. Detailed ODT timing diagrams for different power-down modes areshown in Figure 83 (page 137)–Figure 88 (page 141).\nThe power-down state is synchronously exited when CKE is registered HIGH (in con-\njunction with a NOP or DESELECT command), as shown in Figure 70 (page 125).1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nPower-Down Mode\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

CKE must remain at the valid input level the entire time it takes to achieve\nthe three clocks of registration. Thus, after any CKE transition, CKE may not transitionfrom its valid level during the time period of \ntIS + 2 × tCK + tIH. CKE must not transition\nduring its tIS and tIH window.\n3.tXP timing is used for exit precharge power-down and active power-down to any non-\nREAD command.\n4.tXARD timing is used for exit active power-down to READ command if fast exit is selec-\nted via MR (bit 12 = 0).\n5.tXARDS timing is used for exit active power-down to READ command if slow exit is se-\nlected via MR (bit 12 = 1).\n6. No column accesses are allowed to be in progress at the time power-down is entered. If\nthe DLL was not in a locked state when CKE went LOW, the DLL must be reset after exit-ing power-down mode for proper READ operation.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nPower-Down Mode\nCCMTD-1725822587-9658\n1GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

Current state is the state of the DDR2 SDRAM immediately prior to clock edge n.\n3. Command (n) is the command registered at clock edge n, and action (n) is a result of\ncommand (n).\n4. The state of ODT does not affect the states described in this table. The ODT function is\nnot available during self refresh (see ODT Timing (page 134) for more details and spe-\ncific restrictions).\n5. Power-down modes do not perform any REFRESH operations. The duration of power-\ndown mode is therefore limited by the refresh requirements.\n6. “X” means “Don’t Care” (including floating around V REF) in self refresh and power-\ndown. However, ODT must be driven high or low in power-down if the ODT function isenabled via EMR.\n7. All states and sequences not shown are illegal or reserved unless explicitly described\nelsewhere in this document.\n8. Valid commands for power-down entry and exit are NOP and DESELECT only.\n9. On self refresh exit, DESELECT or NOP commands must be issued on every clock edge oc-\ncurring during the \ntXSNR period. READ commands may be issued only after tXSRD (200\nclocks) is satisfied.\n10. Valid commands for self refresh exit are NOP and DESELECT only.\n11. Power-down and self refresh can not be entered while READ or WRITE operations,\nLOAD MODE operations, or PRECHARGE operations are in progress. See SELF REFRESH\n(page 122) and SELF REFRESH (page 80) for a list of detailed restrictions.\n12. Minimum CKE high time is tCKE = 3 × tCK. Minimum CKE LOW time is tCKE = 3 × tCK.\nThis requires a minimum of 3 clock cycles of registration.\n13. Self refresh mode can only be entered from the all banks idle state.\n14.

A minimum of two differential clock cycles mustpass after CKE goes LOW before clock frequency may change. The device input clockfrequency is allowed to change only within minimum and maximum operating fre-quencies specified for the particular speed grade. During input clock frequency change,ODT and CKE must be held at stable LOW levels. When the input clock frequency ischanged, new stable clocks must be provided to the device before precharge power-down may be exited, and DLL must be reset via MR after precharge power-down exit.Depending on the new clock frequency, additional LM commands might be required toadjust the CL, WR, AL, and so forth. Depending on the new clock frequency, an addi-tional LM command might be required to appropriately set the WR MR9, MR10, MR11.During the DLL relock period of 200 cycles, ODT must remain off. After the DLL locktime, the DRAM is ready to operate with a new clock frequency.\nFigure 79: Input Clock Frequency Change During Precharge Power-Down Mode\nCKCK#\nCommand Valid 4 NOP\nAddressCKE\nDQ\nDMDQS, DQS#NOPtCK\nEnter precharge\npower-down modeExit precharge\npower-down modeT0 T1 T3 Ta0 T2\nDon’t CareValidtCKE (MIN) 3\ntXPLM\nDLL RESETValid\nValidNOPtCH tCLTa1 Ta2 Tb0 Ta3\n2 x tCK (MIN) 1 1 x tCK (MIN) 2tCH tCL\ntCK\nODT\n200 x tCK NOPTa4Previous clock frequency New clock frequency\nFrequency\nchange\nIndicates a break in time scaleHigh-ZHigh-ZtCKE (MIN) 3\nNotes: 1.

All data will be lost during a resetcondition; however, the DDR2 SDRAM device will continue to operate properly if thefollowing conditions outlined in this section are satisfied.\nThe reset condition defined here assumes all supply voltages (V\nDD, VDDQ , VDDL, and\nVREF) are stable and meet all DC specifications prior to, during, and after the RESET op-\neration. All other input balls of the DDR2 SDRAM device are a “Don’t Care” during RE-\nSET with the exception of CKE.\nIf CKE asynchronously drops LOW during any valid operation (including a READ or\nWRITE burst), the memory controller must satisfy the timing parameter tDELAY before\nturning off the clocks. Stable clocks must exist at the CK, CK# inputs of the DRAM be-fore CKE is raised HIGH, at which time the normal initialization sequence must occur(see Initialization). The DDR2 SDRAM device is now ready for normal operation afterthe initialization sequence. Figure 80 (page 133) shows the proper sequence for a RE-SET operation.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nReset\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.

ODT will operate either in synchronous mode or asynchronous mode, depend-ing on the state of CKE. ODT can switch anytime except during self refresh mode and afew clocks after being enabled via EMR, as shown in Figure 81 (page 135).\nThere are two timing categories for ODT—turn-on and turn-off. During active mode\n(CKE HIGH) and fast-exit power-down mode (any row of any bank open, CKE LOW,MR[12 = 0]), \ntAOND, tAON, tAOFD, and tAOF timing parameters are applied, as shown in \nFigure 83 (page 137).\nDuring slow-exit power-down mode (any row of any bank open, CKE LOW, MR[12] = 1)\nand precharge power-down mode (all banks/rows precharged and idle, CKE LOW),\ntAONPD and tAOFPD timing parameters are applied, as shown in Figure 84 (page 137).\nODT turn-off timing, prior to entering any power-down mode, is determined by the pa-rameter \ntANPD (MIN), as shown in Figure 85 (page 138). At state T2, the ODT HIGH sig-\nnal satisfies tANPD (MIN) prior to entering power-down mode at T5. When tANPD\n(MIN) is satisfied, tAOFD and tAOF timing parameters apply. Figure 85 (page 138) also\nshows the example where tANPD (MIN) is not satisfied because ODT HIGH does not oc-\ncur until state T3. When tANPD (MIN) is not satisfied, tAOFPD timing parameters apply.\nODT turn-on timing prior to entering any power-down mode is determined by the pa-rameter \ntANPD, as shown in Figure 86 (page 139). At state T2, the ODT HIGH signal sat-\nisfies tANPD (MIN) prior to entering power-down mode at T5. When tANPD (MIN) is\nsatisfied, tAOND and tAON timing parameters apply. Figure 86 (page 139) also shows\nthe example where tANPD (MIN) is not satisfied because ODT HIGH does not occur un-\ntil state T3. When tANPD (MIN) is not satisfied, tAONPD timing parameters apply.\nODT turn-off timing after exiting any power-down mode is determined by the parame-ter \ntAXPD (MIN), as shown in Figure 87 (page 140). At state Ta1, the ODT LOW signal\nsatisfies tAXPD (MIN) after exiting power-down mode at state T1. When tAXPD (MIN) is\nsatisfied, tAOFD and tAOF timing parameters apply. Figure 87 (page 140) also shows the\nexample where tAXPD (MIN) is not satisfied because ODT LOW occurs at state Ta0.\nWhen tAXPD (MIN) is not satisfied, tAOFPD timing parameters apply.\nODT turn-on timing after exiting either slow-exit power-down mode or precharge pow-er-down mode is determined by the parameter \ntAXPD (MIN), as shown in Figure 88\n(page 141). At state Ta1, the ODT HIGH signal satisfies tAXPD (MIN) after exiting pow-\ner-down mode at state T1. When tAXPD (MIN) is satisfied, tAOND and tAON timing pa-\nrameters apply. Figure 88 (page 141) also shows the example where tAXPD (MIN) is not\nsatisfied because ODT HIGH occurs at state Ta0. When tAXPD (MIN) is not satisfied,\ntAONPD timing parameters apply.1Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM\nODT Timing\nCCMTD-1725822587-96581GbDDR2.pdf – Rev.
