Possible configurations range from 12 LVDS to 24 CMOS outputs, \nincluding combinations of LVDS and CMOS outputs. Three \ncontrol lines are used to determine whether fixed blocks of outputs (three banks of four) are LVDS or CMOS outputs. \nThe ADCLK854 offers two selectable inputs and a sleep mode feature. The IN_SEL pin state determines which input is fanned out to all the outputs. The SLEEP pin enables a sleep mode to power down the device.  \nThe inputs accept various types of single-ended and differential \nlogic levels including LVPECL, LVDS, HSTL, CML, and \nCMOS. Table 8 provides interface options for each type of \nconnection.  \nThis device is available in a 48-pin LFCSP package. It is specified \nfor operation over the standard industrial temperature range of \n−40°C to +85°C.

A | Page 12 of 16 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADCLK854 accepts a clock input from one of two inputs \nand distributes the selected clock to all output channels. The outputs are grouped into three ba nks of four and can be set to \neither LVDS or CMOS levels. This allows the selection of mul-\ntiple logic configurations ranging from 12 LVDS to 24 CMOS \noutputs, along with other combinations using both types of logic. \nCLOCK INPUTS \nThe ADCLK854 differential inputs are internally self-biased. The clock inputs have a resistor divider that sets the common-mode level for the inputs. The complementary inputs are biased about 30 mV lower than the true input to avoid oscillations if \nthe input signal stops. See Figure 20 for the equivalent input circuit. \nThe inputs can be ac-coupled or dc-coupled. Table 8 displays a \nguide for input logic compatibility. A single-ended input can be \naccommodated by ac or dc coupling to one side of the differential input; bypass the other input to ground with a capacitor. \nNote that jitter performance degrades with low input slew rate, as shown in Figure 11. See Figure 27 through Figure 32 for different termination schemes. \n9kΩ 9.5kΩ\n9kΩ 10kΩ 10kΩ 8.5kΩVS\nCLKx CLKx\nGND\n07218-020 \nFigure 20. ADCLK854 Input Stage \nAC-COUPLED INPUT APPLICATIONS \nThe ADCLK854 offers two options for ac coupling. The first option requires no external components (excluding the dc \nblocking capacitor), it allows the user to simply couple the \nreference signal onto the cloc k input pins. For more infor-\nmation, see Figure 29. The second option allows the use of the V\nREF pin to set the dc \nbias level for the ADCLK854. The V REF pin can be connected to \nCLKx and CLKxE through resistors. This method allows lower \nimpedance termination of sign als at the ADCLK854 (for more \ninformation, see Figure 32). The internal bias resistors remain \nin parallel with the external biasing. However, the relatively \nhigh impedance of the internal resistors allows the external \ntermination to V REF to dominate. This method is also useful \nwhen offsetting the inputs; using only the internal biasing, as \npreviously mentioned, is not desirable. \nCLOCK OUTPUTS \nEach driver consists of a differential LVDS output or two single-ended CMOS outputs (a lways in phase). When the \nLVDS driver is enabled, the corresponding CMOS driver is in \ntristate; when the CMOS driver is enabled, the corresponding \nLVDS driver is powered down and tristated.

This pin has an internal 200 kΩ pull-down \nresistor.  \nSleep Mode  \nSleep mode powers down the chip except for the internal band gap. The input is active high, which puts the outputs into a high-Z state. This pin has a 200 kΩ pull-down resistor.  \nPOWER SUPPLY \nThe ADCLK854 requires a 1.8 V ± 5% power supply for V S. \nBest practice recommends bypa ssing the power supply on the PCB with adequate capacitance (>10 μF), and bypassing all power pins with adequate capacita nce (0.1 μF) as close to the \npart as possible. The layout of the ADCLK854 evaluation board (ADCLK854/PCBZ) provides a good layout example. \nExposed Metal Paddle \nThe exposed metal paddle on the ADCLK854 package is an electrical connection as well as a thermal enhanc ement. For the \ndevice to function properly, the paddle must be properly attached to ground (GND). The ADCLK854 dissipates heat \nthrough its exposed paddle. The PCB acts as a heat sink for the \nADCLK854. The PCB attachment must provide a good thermal \npath to a larger heat dissipation area, such as the ground plane \non the PCB. This requires a grid of vias from the top layer down to the ground plane. See Figure 23 for an example. \nVIAS TO GND PLANE\n07218-023 \nFigure 23.

A | Page 14 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nUSING THE ADCLK854 OUTPUTS FOR ADC CLOCK \nAPPLICATIONS \nAny high speed, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is extremely \nsensitive to the quality of the sampling clock provided by the user. An ADC can be thought of as a sampling mixer, and any \nnoise, distortion, or timing jitter on the clock is combined with \nthe desired signal at the analog-to-digital output. Clock integrity requirements scale with the analog input frequency and resolu-tion, with higher analog input frequency applications at ≥14-bit resolution being the most stringent. The theoretical SNR of an \nADC is limited by the ADC resolution and the jitter on the \nsampling clock. Considering an ideal ADC of infinite resolution where the step size and quantization error can be ignored, the available SNR can be  expressed approximately by  \n\uf0fa\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\uf0e9\n\uf0b4 \uf03d\nJAT fSNR2π1log 20  \nwhere fA is the highest analog frequency being digitized and TJ \nis the rms jitter on the sampling clock.  \nFigure 24 shows the required sampling clock jitter as a function \nof the analog frequency and effective number of bits (ENOB).

SNR and ENOB vs. Analog Input Frequency  \nMany high performance ADCs fe ature differential clock inputs \nto simplify the task of providing the required low jitter clock on \na noisy PCB. Distributing a single-ended clock on a noisy PCB \ncan result in coupled noise on the sample clock. Differential \ndistribution has inherent common-mode rejection that can \nprovide superior clock performance in a noisy environment. \nConsider the input requirements of the ADC (differential or single-ended, logic level, and termination) when selecting the best clocking/converter solution. LVDS CLOCK DISTRIBUTION \nThe ADCLK854 provides clock outputs that are selectable as either CMOS or LVDS level outputs. LVDS is a differential output option that uses a current-mode output stage. The nominal current is 3.5 mA, whic h yields 350 mV output swing \nacross a 100 Ω resistor. The LVDS output meets or exceeds all ANSI/TIA/EIA-644 specific ations. A recommended \ntermination circuit for the LVDS outputs is shown in Figure 25.  \nIf ac coupling is necessary, place decoupling capacitors either \nbefore or after the 100 Ω termination resistor. See Application Note AN-586 at www.analog.com  for more information on LVDS. \nVS\nLVDS100Ω\nDIFFERENTIAL (COUPLED)VS\nLVDS 100Ω\n07218-025 \nFigure 25. LVDS Output Termination  \nCMOS CLOCK DISTRIBUTION \nThe output drivers of the AD CLK854 can be configured as \nCMOS drivers. When selected as a CMOS driver, each output becomes a pair of CMOS outputs. These outputs are 1.8 V CMOS compatible.  \nWhen single-ended CMOS clocking is used, some of the \nfollowing guidelines apply. \nDesign point-to-point connections such that each driver has only \none receiver, if possible. Connecting outputs in this manner allows for simple termination schemes and minimizes ringing \ndue to possible mismatched impedances on the output trace. \nSeries termination at the source is generally required to provide transmission line matching and/ or to reduce current transients \nat the driver.  \nThe value of the resistor (typically 10 Ω to 100 Ω) is dependent \non the board design and timing requirements. CMOS outputs are also limited in terms of the capacitive load or trace length \nthat they can drive. Typically, trace lengths less than 3 inches \nare recommended to preserve signal rise/fall times and signal integrity.  \n10Ω\nMICROSTRIP60.4Ω\n1.0 INCH\nCMOS CMOS\n07218-026 \nFigure 26. Series Termination of CMOS Output  \nTermination at the far end of th e PCB trace is a second option. \nThe CMOS outputs of the ADCLK854 do not supply enough \ncurrent to provide a full voltage swing with a low impedance \nresistive, far end termination, as shown in Figure 27. The far end termination network should match the PCB trace impedance and provide the desired switching point. The reduced signal swing may \n ADCLK854\n \nRev. A | Page 15 of 16 still meet receiver input requirements in some applications. This \ncan be useful when driving long trace lengths on less critical networks. \nCMOS CMOS10Ω50Ω\n100Ω100ΩVS\n07218-027 \nFigure 27. CMOS Output with Far End Termination  \nBecause of the limitations of single-ended CMOS clocking, consider using differential outputs when driving high speed signals over long traces. The ADCLK854 offers LVDS outputs that are better suited for driving long traces wherein the inherent \nnoise immunity of differential signaling provides superior \nperformance for clocking converters.  \nINPUT TERMINATION OPTIONS \nFor single-ended operation always bypass unused input to GND, as shown in Figure 31. \nFigure 32 illustrates the use of V\nREF to provide low impedance \ntermination into V S/2. In addition, a way to negate the 30 mV \ninput offset is with external resistor values; for example, using a \n1.8 V CMOS with long traces to provide far end termination. \n100ΩCLK\nCLK\n100ΩCLK\nCLK\n07218-028 \nFigure 28.
