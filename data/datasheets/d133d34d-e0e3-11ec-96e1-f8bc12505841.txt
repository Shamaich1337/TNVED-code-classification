They \nare an ideal choice for driving low power, high resolution, high \nperformance SAR and Σ-Δ analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) \nwith resolutions up to 16 bits from dc to 1 MHz on only 1.25 mA of quiescent current. The adjustable level of the output common-mode voltage allows the ADA4940-1 /ADA4940-2  to match the \ninput common-mode voltage of multiple ADCs. The internal common-mode feedback loop provides exceptional output balance, as well as suppression of even-order harmonic distortion products. \nWith the ADA4940-1 /ADA4940-2 , differential gain configurations \nare easily realized with a simple external feedback network of four resistors determining the closed-loop gain of the amplifier. The ADA4940-1 /ADA4940-2  are fabricated using Analog Devices, \nInc., SiGe complementary bipolar process, enabling them to achieve very low levels of distortion with an input voltage noise \nof only 3.9 nV/√Hz. The low dc offset and excellent dynamic \nperformance of the ADA4940-1 /ADA4940-2  make them well \nsuited for a variety of data acquisition and signal processing \napplications.

Even temporarily exceeding this temperature limit \ncan change the stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric performance of the ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2. Exceeding a junction temperature \nof 150°C for an extended period can result in changes in the \nsilicon devices, potential ly causing failure.  The power dissipated in the package (P\nD) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the package due to the load drive for all outputs. The quiescent power dissipation is the  voltage between the supply pi ns (±V\nS) \ntimes the quiescent current (I S). The load current consists of the \ndifferential  and common -mode currents flowing to the load, as \nwell as currents flowing through the external feedback networks \nand internal common -mode feedback loop. The internal \nresistor tap used in the common -mode feedback loop places a \nnegligible differential load on the output. Consider rms  voltages \nand currents when dealing with ac signals.  \nAirflow reduces θ JA. In addition, more metal directly in contact \nwith the package leads from metal traces , through holes, ground, \nand power planes reduces the θ JA. \nFigure 3 shows the maximum safe power dissipation in the \npackage v s. the ambient temperature for the 8-lead SOIC  (θJA = \n158°C/W , single)  the 16-lead LFCSP  (θJA = 91.3°C/W , single) \nand 24-lead LFCSP (θ JA = 65.1° C / W,  dual) packages on a JEDEC \nstandard 4 -layer board. θ JA values are approximations.  \n3.5\n0\n–40 –20 0 20 40 60 120 100 80MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE (°C)\n08452-0040.51.01.52.02.53.0\nADA4940-2 (LFCSP)\nADA4940-1 (LFCSP)\nADA4940-1 (SOIC)\n \nFigure 3.

For example, the differential output voltage (or \nequivalently, output differential mode voltage) is defined as \nVOUT, dm  = (V+OUT − V−OUT) \nwhere V+OUT and V−OUT refer to the voltages at the +OUT and \n−OUT terminals with respect to a common reference.  \nSimilarly, the differential input voltage is defined as  \nVIN, dm = (+D IN − (−D IN)) \nCommon-Mode Voltage (CMV) \nCMV refers to the average of two node voltages.

E | Page 22 of 30 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 are high speed , low power \ndifferential amplifier s fabricated on Analog Devices advanced \ndielectrically isolated SiGe bipolar process. They  provide two \nclosely balanced differential outputs in response to either \ndifferential or single -ended input signals. An external feedback \nnetwork that is similar to a  voltage  feedback operational \namplifie r sets the differential gain . The output common -mode \nvoltage is independent of the input common -mode voltage and \nis set by an external voltage at the V OCM terminal. The PNP \ninput stage allows input common -mode voltages between the \nnegative  supply and 1 .2 V below the positive supply. A rail- to-\nrail output stage supplies a wide output voltage range.  \nThe DISABLE  pin can reduce the supply current of the \namplifier to 13.5 µA. \nFigure 62 shows the ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 architecture. \nThe differential feedback loop consists of the differential trans -\nconductance G DIFF working thr ough the G O output buffers and \nthe R F/RG feedback networks.  The common -mode feedback \nloop is set up  with a voltage divider across the two differential  \noutputs to create an outpu t voltage midpoint and a common -\nmode transconductance , GCM. \n08452-058GOCC\nCCRF RG\nGCM GDIFF\nGO\nRGVREF–OUT\n+OUT\nRF+DIN\n–DIN+IN\n–IN VOCM\n \nFigure 62.

E | Pag e 23 of 30 APPLICATIONS INFORMAT ION \nANALYZING AN APPLICA TION CIRCUIT  \nThe ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 use open -loop gain and negative \nfeedback to force their  differential and common -mode output \nvoltages in such a way as to minimize the differential and common -\nmode error voltages. The differential error voltage is defined as \nthe voltage betw een the differential inputs labe led +IN and −IN (see \nFigure 61). For most purposes, this voltage is  zero. Similarly, the \ndifference between the actual output common -mode voltage and \nthe voltage applied to V OCM is also zero. Starting from these two \nassumptions, any application circuit can be analyzed.  \nSETTING THE CLOSED -LOOP GAIN  \nDetermine t he differential mode gain of the circuit in Figure 61 \nby using the following equation:  \nGF\ndmINdm OUT\nRR\nVV\n=\n,, \nThis assumes that the input resistors (R G) and feedback resistors \n(RF) on each side are equal.  \nESTIMATING THE OUTPU T NOISE VOLTAGE  \nEstimate t he differential output noise of the  ADA4940- 1/ \nADA4940- 2 by using the noise model in Figure 63. The input -\nreferred  noise voltage density, v nIN, is modeled as a differential \ninput, and the noise currents, i nIN− and i nIN+, appear between \neach input and ground. The noise currents are assum ed equal \nand produce  a voltage across the parallel combina tion of the gain \nand feedback  resistances. v nCM is the noise voltage density at the \nVOCM pin. Each of the four resistors contributes (4kTR x)1/2. Table 14 \nsummarizes the input noise sources, the multiplication factors, and the output -referred noise density terms.

The amplitudes of the signals at each output \nremain equal and 180°  out of phase. The input -to-output, \ndifferential mode gain varies proportionately to the feedback \nmismatch, but the output balance is unaffected.  \nAs well as causing a noise contribution from V OCM, ratio -matching  \nerrors in the external resistors result in a degradation of the ability \nof the circuit to reject input common -mode signals,  much the \nsame as f or a four  resistor s difference amplifier made from a \nconventional op amp.  \nIn addition, if the dc levels of the input and output common -\nmode voltages are different, matching errors  result in a small \ndifferential mode , output offset voltage. When G = 1, with a \nground -referenced input signal and the output common -mode \nlevel set to 2.5 V , an output offset of as much as 25 mV (1% of the difference in common -mode levels) can result if 1% tolerance  \nresistors are used. Resistors of 1% tolerance result in a worst -\ncase input CMRR of about 40 dB, a worst- case differential  mode \noutput offset of 25 mV due to the 2.5 V level- shift, and no \nsignificant degradation in output balance error.   \nCALCULATING THE INPU T IMPEDANCE OF AN \nAPPLICATION CIRCUIT  \nThe effective input impeda nce of a circuit depends on whether \nthe amplifier is being driven by a single -ended or differential \nsignal source. For balanced differential input signals, as shown in Figure 64, the input impedance (R\nIN, dm) between the inputs \n(+D IN and −D IN) is simply R IN, dm = 2 × R G. For an unbalanced, single -ended input signal (see Figure 65), \nthe input impedance is  \n()\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n+×−=F GFG\nseIN\nR RRRR\n21, \n+VS\nADA4940-1/\nADA4940-2+IN\n–INRF\nRF+DIN\n–DINVOCMRG\nRGVOUT, dm\n08452-051 \nFigure 64.

To compensate for the \nimbalance of the gain resistors, add a correction resistor (R TS) \nin series with R G in the lower loop. R TS is the Thevenin \nequivalent of the source resi stance, R S, and the termination \nresistance, R T, and is equal to R S||R T.

Thevenin Equivalent and Matched Gain Resistors  \nFigure 69 presents a tractable circuit with matched feedback  \nloops that can be easily evaluated.  \nIt is useful to point out two eff ects that occur with a terminated  \ninput. The first is that the value of R G is increased in both loops,  \nlowering the overall closed -loop gain. The second  is that V TH \nis a little larger than 1 V p -p, as it would be if R T = 50 Ω. \nThese two effects have opposite impacts on the output voltage, and for large resistor values in the feedback loops (~1  kΩ), the \neffects essentially cancel each other out. For small R\nF and R G, \nor high gains, however, the diminished closed -loop gain is  not \ncance lled completely by the inc reased V TH. This can be seen by \nevaluating Figure 69. \nThe desired differential output in this example is 1 V p -p \nbecause the terminated input signal was 1 V p -p and the \nclosed -loop gain = 1. Th e actual differential output voltage, \nhowever, is equal to (1.0 2 V p-p)(1000 /1025.5) = 0.9 96 V p-p. \nThis is within the tolerance of the resistors , so no change to \nthe feedback resistor , RF, is required.  \nINPUT COMMON- MODE VOLTAGE RANGE  \nThe ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 input common -mode range is \nshifted down by  approximately 1 VBE, in contrast to other ADC \ndrivers with center ed input ranges , such as the ADA4939 -1/ \nADA4939 -2. The downward -shifted input common -mode range \nis especially su ited to dc -coupled, single -ended -to-differential, \nand single -supply applications.  \nFor ± 2.5 V or +5 V  supply operation, the input common -mode \nrange at the summing nodes of the amplifier is specified as −2.7 V \nto +1.3 V or −0.2 V to 3.8 V , and is specified a s −0.2 V to + 1.8 V \nwith a + 3 V supply.   \n \nADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 26 of 30 INPUT AND OUTPUT CAP ACITIVE AC COUPLING  \nAlthough  the ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 is best suited to dc -\ncoupled applications, it is nonetheless possible to use it in ac -\ncoupled circuits. Input ac  coupling capacitors can be inserted \nbetween the source and R G. This ac coupling blocks the flow \nof the dc common -mode feedback current and ca uses the \nADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 dc input common -mode voltage to \nequal the dc output common -mode voltage. These ac c oupling \ncapacitors must  be placed in both loops to keep the feedback \nfactors matched. Output ac coupling capacitors can be placed in \nseries between each output and its respective load.  \nSETTING THE OUTPUT C OMMON -MODE VOLTAGE  \nThe V OCM pin of the ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 is internally \nbiased at a voltage approximately equal to the midsupply point, \n[(+V S) + (−V S)]/2. Relyi ng on this internal bias results in an \noutput common -mode voltage that is within approximately \n100 mV of the expected value.  \nIn cases where more accurate control of the output common -mode  \nlevel is required, it is recommended that an external source, or \nresistor divider (10 kΩ or greater resistors), be used. The output \ncommon -mode offset listed in the  Specifications  section assumes \nthat the V OCM input is driven by a low impedance  voltage source.   \nIt is also possible to connect the V OCM input to a common -mode \nlevel (CML) output of an ADC. However, care must be taken to \nensure that the output has sufficient drive capability. The input \nimpedance of the V OCM pin is approximately 250 kΩ.  \nDISABLE  PIN \nThe ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 feature a DISABLE  pin that can \nbe used to minimize the quiescent current consumed  when the \ndevice is not being used. DISABLE  is asserted by applying a low \nlogic level to the DISABLE  pin. The thres hold between high and \nlow logic levels is nominally 1.4 V above the negative supply rail. \nSee Table 5 and Table 8 for the threshold limits.  \nThe DISABLE  pin features an internal pull -up network that \nenables the amplifier for normal operation. The ADA4940- 1/ \nADA4940- 2 DISABLE  pin can be left floating (that is, no \nexternal connection is required) and does not req uire an \nexternal pull -up resistor to ensure normal on operation (see \nFigure 70). When the ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 is disabled, the \noutput is high impedance. Note that the outputs are tied to the \ninputs through the feedback resistors and to the source using the gain resistors. In addition, there are back -to-back diodes  on the \ninput pins that limit the differential voltage to 1.2 V .  \n08452-063DISABLEAMPLIFIER\nBIAS CURRENT\n–VS+VS\n \nFigure 70. DISABLE  Pin Circuit  \nDRIVING A CAPACITIVE  LOAD  \nA purely capacitive load reacts with the bond  wire and pin \ninductance of the ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2, resulting in high \nfrequency ringing in the transient response and loss of phase margin. One way to minimize this effect is t o place a resistor in \nseries with each output to buffer the load capacitance.  The resistor \nand load capacitance form a first -order, low -pass filter; therefore, \nthe resistor value must  be as small as possible. In some cases, \nthe ADCs require small series re sistors to be added on their inputs.  \nFigure 71 illustrates the c apacitive load vs. the series resist ance \nrequired to maintain a minimum 45° of phase margin.  \n120\n0\n5 100 10 1000\n08452-06420406080100SERIES RESISTANCE (Ω)\nLOAD CAPACITANCE (pF)+IN –OUT\n+OUT–FB\n+FB–INVOCM\n0.1µFRS\nRS\nR1CL\nCL\nR2R4+2.5V\n–2.5VR3VIN\n \nFigure 71.

E | Pag e 27 of 30 DRIVING A HIGH PRECISION ADC  \nThe ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 are ideally suited for broadband \ndc-coupled applications. The circuit  in Figure 73 shows a front -\nend connection for an ADA4940- 1 driving an AD7982, which is \nan 18 -bit, 1 MSPS successive approximation, analog -to-digital \nconverter (ADC) that operates from a single power supply, 3 V \nto 5 V . It contains a low power, high speed, 18 -bit sampling \nADC and a versatile serial interface port. The reference voltage, \nREF , is applied externally and can be set independent of the supply voltage. As shown in  Figure 73, the ADA4940- 1 is dc-\ncoupled on the input and the output, which eliminates the need \nfor a transformer to drive the ADC. The amplifier  performs a \nsingle -ended -to-differential conversion if needed and level \nshifts  the input signal to match the input common mode of the \nADC.  The ADA4940- 1 is configured with a dual 7  V supply \n(+6 V and −1 V) and a gai n that is set by the ratio of the \nfeedback resistor to the gain resistor. In addition, the circuit can be used in a singl e-ended -input -to-differential output or \ndifferential -input -to-differential outpu t configuration. If needed,  \na termination resistor in parallel with the source input can be \nused. Whether the input is a single -ended input or differential, \nthe input impedance  of the amplifier can be calculated as shown in \nthe Terminating a Single -Ended Input  section. If R1 = R2 = R3 = \nR4 = 1 kΩ, the single -ended input impedance is approximately \n1.33 kΩ, which, in parallel with a 52.3  Ω termination res istor , \nprovides a 50 Ω termination for the source. An additional 25.5  Ω \n(1025.5 Ω total) at the inverting input balances the parallel impedance of  the 50 Ω source and the termination resistor driving \nthe noninverting input. However, if a differential sourc e input is \nused, the differential input impedance is 2 kΩ. In this case,  two \n52.3 Ω termination resistors are used to terminate the inputs.  \nIn this example, the signal generator has a 10 V p -p symmetric, \nground -referenced bipolar output. The V\nOCM input is bypassed for \nnoise reduction and set externally with 1% resist ors to 2.5 V to \nmaximize  the output dynamic range . With  an output common -mode voltage of 2.5 V , each ADA4940- 1 output  swin gs betw een \n0 V and 5 V , opposite in phase, providing a gain of 1 and a \n10 V p-p differential signal to the ADC input. The differential  RC \nsection between the ADA4940- 1 output and the A DC provides  \nsingle -pole, low -pass filtering with a corner frequency of 1.79 MHz \nand extra  buffering for the current  spikes that are output from the \nADC input when its sample -and-hold (SHA) capacitors  are \ndischarged.  \nThe total system power in Figure 73 is under 35 mW. A large \nportion of that power is the current coming from supplies to the \noutput, which  is set at 2.5  V, going back to the input through the \nfeedback and gain resistors. To reduce that power  to 25 mW , \nincrease the val ue of the feedback and gain resistor from 1 kΩ \nto 2 kΩ and set the value of the resistors R5 and R6 to 3 kΩ. The \nADR435 is used to regulate the +6  V supply to +5 V , which ends \nup poweri ng the ADC and setting the reference voltage for the \nVOCM pin.  \nFigure 72 shows the FFT of a 20 k Hz differential input tone \nsampled at 1 MSPS.

E | Page 28 of 30 LAYOUT, GROUNDING, A ND BYPASSING  \nAs a high speed device, the ADA4940- 1/ADA4940- 2 are \nsensitive to the PCB environment in which they  operate. \nRealizing their  superior performance requires attention to \nthe details of high speed PCB design.  \nADA4940- 1 LFCSP EXAMPLE  \nThe first requirement is a solid ground plane that covers as \nmuch of the board area around the ADA4940- 1 as possible. \nHowever, clear the area near the feedback resistors (R F), gain \nresistors (R G), and the input summing nodes (Pin 2 and Pin  3) \nof all ground and  power planes (see Figure 74). Clearing the \nground and power planes minimizes any stray capacitance at \nthese nodes and prevents peaking of the response of the amplifier at high frequencies.  \nThe thermal resistance, θ\nJA, is specified for the device, including \nthe exposed pad, soldered to a high thermal conductivity 4 -layer  \ncircuit board, as described in EIA/JESD  51-7. \n08452-086 \nFigure 74. Ground and Power Plane Voiding in Vicinity of R F and R G Bypass t he power supply pins as close to the device as possible \nand directly to a nearby ground plane. Use h igh freque ncy ceramic \nchip capacitors . Use two parallel bypass capacitors (1000 pF and \n0.1 µF) for each supply. Place t he 1000 pF capacitor closer to the \ndevice. Further away, provide low frequency bypassing using \n10 µF tantalum capacitors from each supply to ground.  \nEnsure that s ignal routing is short and direct to avoid parasitic \neffects. Wherever complementary signals exist, provide a \nsymmetrical layout to maximize balanced performance. When \nrouting differential signals over a long distance, ensure that PCB trace s are close together, and twist any differential wiring \nsuch that loop area is minimized. Doing this reduces radiated energy and makes the circuit less susceptible to interference.  \n1.30\n0.80\n0.80 1.30\n08452-087 \nFigure 75.
