Each \nof the four outputs is factory or resistor programmable \nbetween 1V to 4.0V (MAX20029/MAX20029B) or 0.7V \nto 3.8V (MAX20029C/MAX20029D). The MAX20029/\nMAX20029C has two 0.5A/1A/1.5A channels and two \n0.5A/1.5A channels, while the MAX20029B/MAX20029D \nhas two 0.5A/1.5A channels and by combining channels 1 \nand 2, a single 2A/3A channel. The PMICs operate from \n3.0V to 5.5V, making them ideal for automotive point-of-\nload and post-regulation applications. \nThe PMICs feature fixed-frequency PWM-mode operation \nwith a switching frequency of 2.2MHz. High-frequency op-\neration allows for an all-ceramic capacitor design and \nsmall-size external components. The low-resistance on-\nchip switches ensure high efficiency at heavy loads while \nminimizing critical inductances, making the layout a much \nsimpler task with respect to discrete solutions. Internal \ncurrent sensing and loop compensation reduce board \nspace and system cost. \nThe PMICs offer a spread-spectrum option to reduce radi-\nated emissions. Two of the four buck converters operate \n180° out-of-phase with the internal clock. This feature re-\nduces the necessary input capacitance and improves EMI \nas well. All four buck converters operate in constant PWM \nmode outside the AM band. The PMICs offer a SYNC in-\nput to synchronize to an external clock. \nThe PMICs provide individual enable inputs and power-\ngood/ reset outputs, as well as factory-programmable PG \ntimes. \nThe PMICs offer several important protection features in-\ncluding: input overvoltage protection, input undervoltage \nlockout, cycle-by-cycle current limiting, and overtempera -\nture shutdown. \nThe MAX20029/MAX20029B/MAX20029C/MAX20029D \nPMICs are available in a 28-pin TQFN package with an \nexposed pad and are specified for operation over the \n-40°C to +125°C automotive temperature range.\nApplications \n●Automotive\n●IndustrialBenefits and Features \n●Quad Step-Down DC-DC Converters with Integrated\nFETs\n●Operate from 3.0V to 5.5V Supply Voltage\n●0.7V to 4.0V Fixed or Adjustable Output Voltage\n●2.2MHz Switching Frequency\n●MAX20029/MAX20029C: Up to Four 1.5A Channels\n●MAX20029B/MAX20029D: Up to One 3A + Two 1.5A\nChannels\n●Designed to Improve Automotive EMI Performance\n•Forced-PWM Operation\n•Two Channels 180° Out-of-Phase\n•SYNC Input\n•Spread-Spectrum Option\n●Soft-Start and Supply Sequencing Reduces Inrush\nCurrent\n●Individual Enable Inputs and Power-Good Outputs\nSimplify Sequencing\n●OV Input-Voltage Monitoring\n●Overtemperature and Short-Circuit Protection\n●28-Pin (5mm x 5mm x 0.8mm) TQFN-EP Package\n●-40°C to +125°C Operating Temperature Range\nClick here  to ask an associate for production status of specific part numbers.\nMAX20029/MAX20029B/\nMAX20029C/MAX20029DAutomotive Quad/Triple Low-Voltage Step-\nDown DC-DC Converters\nOrdering Information  appears at end of data sheet. 19-100083; Rev 12; 4/22\n© 2022 Analog Devices, Inc.

The \nPMICs deliver up to 1.5A of load current per output, and achieve ±3% output error over load, line, and temperature \nranges. \nThe PMICs feature fixed-frequency PWM-mode operation with a 2.2MHz switching frequency. An optional spread-\nspectrum frequency modulation minimizes radiated electromagnetic emissions due to the switching frequency, while a \nfactory-programmable synchronization input (SYNC) allows the device to synchronize to an external clock. \nIntegrated low R DS(ON)  switches help minimize efficiency losses at heavy loads and reduce critical/parasitic inductance, \nmaking the layout a much simpler task with respect to discrete solutions. \nThe PMICs are offered in factory-preset output voltages to allow customers to achieve ±3% output-voltage accuracy, \nwithout using expensive 0.1% resistors. In addition, adjustable output-voltage versions can be set to any desired values \nbetween 1.0V and 4.0V using an external resistive divider. See the Selector Guide  for available options. \nAdditionally, each converter features soft-start, PG_ output, overcurrent, and overtemperature protections (see the \nInternal Block Diagram ). \nControl Scheme \nThe PMICs use peak current-mode control, and feature internal slope compensation and loop compensation, both of \nwhich reduce board space and allow a very compact solution. \nHybrid Load-Line Architecture \nThe PMICs feature hybrid load-line architecture to reduce the output capacitance needed, potentially saving system cost \nand size. This results in a measurable load-transient response (see Figure 1 ). \n+5.0%\n+1.5%\n0%\n-1.0%\n-3.5%\n1.0A\n0A4µs\n1µs 1µs4µs\nFigure 1. Load-Transient Response \nInput Overvoltage Monitoring (OV) \nThe PMICs feature an input overvoltage-monitoring circuit on the input supply. When the input exceeds 5.8V (typ) all \npower-good indicators (PG_) go low. When the input supply returns to within the operating range of 5.7V (typ) or less \nduring the timeout period, the power-good indicators go high. \nInput Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) \nThe PMICs feature an undervoltage lockout on the PV_ inputs set at 2.77V (typ) falling. This prevents loss of control of \nthe device by shutting down all outputs. This circuit is only active when at least one buck converter is enabled. \nPower-Good Outputs (PG_) \nThe PMICs feature an open-drain power-good output for each of the four buck regulators. PG_ asserts low when the \noutput voltage drops 6% below the regulated voltage or 10% above the regulated voltage for approximately 15μs. PG_ \nremains asserted for a fixed number of switching cycles after the output returns to its regulated voltage. See the Selector MAX20029/MAX20029B/\nMAX20029C/MAX20029DAutomotive Quad/Triple Low-Voltage Step-Down\nDC-DC Converters\nwww.analog.com Analog Devices  |  11\nGuide  for available options. PG_ asserts low during soft-start and in shutdown. PG_becomes high impedance when \nBuck_ is in regulation. Connect PG_ to a logic supply with a 10kΩ resistor. \nSoft-Start \nThe soft-start time limits startup inrush current by forcing the output voltage to ramp up towards its regulation point. \nDuring soft-start, the converters operate in skip mode to prevent the outputs from discharging. Expected soft-start time \nfor MAX20029 and MAX20029B is approximately 1.5ms, and approximately 1ms for MAX20029C/MAX20029D (a scaling \nfactor is applied due to the internal voltage reference difference). \nSpread-Spectrum Option \nThe PMICs feature a linear spread-spectrum (SS) operation, which varies the internal operating frequency between f SW \nand (f SW + 3%). The internal oscillator is frequency modulated at a rate of 1.5kHz with a frequency deviation of 3% \n(see Figure 2 ). This function does not apply to an oscillation frequency applied externally through the SYNC pin. Spread \nspectrum is a factory-selectable option. See the Selector Guide  for available options. \nfSW+ 3%\nfSW\nt t + 667µs\nTIMEt + 1.334msINTERNALOSCILLATORFREQUENCY\nFigure 2. Effect of Spread Spectrum on Internal Oscillator \nSynchronization (SYNC) \nThe PMICs feature a SYNC input to allow the internal oscillator to synchronize with an external clock. SYNC accepts \nsignal frequencies in the range of 1.7MHz < f SYNC  < 2.5MHz. Connect to PGND_ if the SYNC feature is not used. \nCurrent-Limit/Short-Circuit Protection \nThe PMICs offer a current-limit feature that protects the devices against short-circuit and overload conditions on each \noutput. In the event of a short-circuit or overload condition at an output, the high-side MOSFET remains on until the \ninductor current reaches the high-side MOSFET’s current-limit threshold. The converter then turns on the low-side \nMOSFET and the inductor current ramps down. The converter allows the high-side MOSFET to turn on only when the \ninductor current ramps down to the low-side MOSFET’s current threshold. This cycle repeats until the short or overload \ncondition is removed. \nOvertemperature Protection \nThermal-overload protection limits the total power dissipation in the PMICs. When the junction temperature exceeds \n+185°C (typ), an internal thermal sensor shuts down the step-down converters, allowing the IC to cool. The thermal \nsensor turns on the IC again after the junction temperature cools by 15°C. The IC goes through a standard power-up \nsequence as defined in the Soft-Start  section.

Connect a resistive \ndivider from output (V OUT_ ) to OUTS_ to GND to set the output voltage (see Figure 3 ). Select R2 (OUTS_ to the GND \nresistor) ≤ 100kΩ. Calculate R1 (V OUT_  to the OUTS_ resistor) with the following equation: \nR1=R2[(VOUT_\nVOUTS_)−1]\n \nwhere V OUTS_  = 1.0V (see the Electrical Characteristics  table). The output voltage is nominal at 50% load current. \nThe external feedback resistive divider must be frequency compensated for proper operation. Place a capacitor across \nR1 in the resistive divider network. Use the following equation to determine the value of the capacitor: \nIfR2\nR1>1,C1=C(R2\nR1) \nelse C1 = C, where C = 15pF. \nMAX20029\nMAX20029BVOUT_\nR1 C1\nOUTS_\nR2\nFigure 3. Adjustable Output-Voltage Configuration \nConnect OUTS_ to V OUT_  for a fixed 1.0V output voltage. \nInductor Selection \nThe PMICs are optimized for use with a 1.5μH inductor on outputs configured for 0.5A, 1A, or 1.5A, and a 1.0μH inductor \nfor an output configured for 2A or 3A. For output voltages less than 0.9V, 0.47μH is recommended. \nInput Capacitor \nThe PMICs are designed to operate with a single 2.2μF ceramic bypass capacitor on each PV_ input. Phase interleaving \nof the four buck converters contributes to a lower required input capacitance by canceling input ripple currents. Place the \nbypass capacitors as close as possible to their corresponding PV_ input to ensure the best EMI and jitter performance. \nOutput Capacitor \nAll outputs of the PMICs are optimized for use with ceramic capacitors. \nFor VOUT\nVIN>0.2:\n \nCOUT_MIN =20\nVOUTμF\n \nCOUT_NOM =33\nVOUTμF\n MAX20029/MAX20029B/\nMAX20029C/MAX20029DAutomotive Quad/Triple Low-Voltage Step-Down\nDC-DC Converters\nwww.analog.com Analog Devices  |  13\nFor VOUT\nVIN≤0.2:\n \nCOUT_MIN =40\nVOUTμF\n \nCOUT_NOM =60\nVOUTμF\n \nAdditional output capacitance can be used if better voltage ripple or load-transient response is required (see Figure 1 ). \nTo guarantee stability, it is recommended that the phase margin be measured under the worst-case deration of the output \ncapacitor(s). Due to the soft-start sequence, the PMICs are unable to drive arbitrarily large output capacitors. \nThermal Considerations \nHow much power the package can dissipate strongly depends on the mounting method of the IC to the PCB and the \ncopper area for cooling. Using the JEDEC test standard, the maximum power dissipation allowed is 2285mW in the \nTQFN package. More power dissipation can be handled by the package if great attention is given during PCB layout. \nFor example, using the top and bottom copper as a heatsink and connecting the thermal vias to one of the middle layers \n(GND) transfers the heat from the package into the board more efficiently, resulting in lower junction temperature at high \npower dissipation in some PMIC applications. Furthermore, the solder mask around the IC area on both top and bottom \nlayers can be removed to radiate the heat directly into the air. The maximum allowable power dissipation in the IC is as \nfollows: \nPMAX=(TJ(MAX)−TA)\nθJC+θCA  \nwhere T J(MAX)  is the maximum junction temperature (+150°C), T A is the ambient air temperature, θ JC (3°C/W for the \n28-pin TQFN) is the thermal resistance from the junction to the case, and θ CA is the thermal resistance from the case \nto the surrounding air through the PCB, copper traces, and the package materials. θ CA is directly related to system-level \nvariables and can be modified to increase the maximum power dissipation. \nThe TQFN package has an exposed thermal pad on its underside. This pad provides a low thermal-resistance path for \nheat transfer into the PCB. This low thermally resistive path carries a majority of the heat away from the IC. The PCB \nis effectively a heatsink for the IC. The exposed pad should be connected to a large ground plane for proper thermal \nand electrical performance. The minimum size of the ground plane is dependent upon many system variables. To create \nan efficient path, the exposed pad should be soldered to a thermal landing, which is connected to the ground plane by \nthermal vias. The thermal landing should be at least as large as the exposed pad and can be made larger depending on \nthe amount of free space from the exposed pad to the other pin landings. A sample layout is available on the evaluation \nkit to speed designs. \nPCB Layout Guidelines \nCareful PCB layout is critical to achieve low switching losses and clean, stable operation. Use a multilayer board \nwhenever possible for better noise immunity and power dissipation. Follow these guidelines for good PCB layout: \n1. Use a large contiguous copper plane under the PMIC packages. Ensure that all heat-dissipating components have \nadequate cooling. \n2. Keep the high-current paths short, especially at the ground terminals. This practice is essential for stable, jitter-free \noperation. The high current path comprising of input capacitor, inductor, and the output capacitor should be as short \nas possible. \n3. Keep the power traces and load connections short. This practice is essential for high efficiency. Use thick copper \nPCBs (2oz vs. 1oz) to enhance full-load efficiency. \n4. Use a single ground plane to reduce the chance of ground potential differences. With a single ground plane, enough \nisolation between analog return signals and high-power signals must be maintained.
