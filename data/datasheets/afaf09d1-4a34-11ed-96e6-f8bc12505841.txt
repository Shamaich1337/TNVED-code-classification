Both the main (P −channel\nMOSFET) and synchronous (N −channel MOSFET)\nswitches are internal.\nThe output voltage is set by an external resistor divider in\nthe range of 0.9 V to 3.9 V and can source at least 1A.\nThe NCP1529 works with two modes of operation;\nPWM/PFM depending on the current required. In PWMmode, the device can supply voltage with a tolerance of/C00363% and 90% efficiency or better. Lighter load currents\ncause the device to automatically switch into PFM mode to\nreduce current consumption and extended battery life.\nAdditional features include soft −start, undervoltage\nprotection, current overload protection and thermal\nshutdown protection. As shown on Figure 1, only sixexternal components are required. The part uses an internal\nreference voltage of 0.6 V . It is recommended to keepNCP1529 in shutdown mode until the input voltage is 2.7 V\nor higher.\nPWM Operating Mode\nIn this mode, the output voltage of the device is regulated\nby modulating the on −time pulse width of the main switch\nQ1 at a fixed 1.7 MHz frequency.\nThe switching of the PMOS Q1 is controlled by a flip−flop\ndriven by the internal oscillator and a comparator thatcompares the error signal from an error amplifier with the\nsum of the sensed current signal and compensation ramp.\nThe driver switches ON and OFF the upper side transistor\n(Q1) while the lower side transistor is switched OFF thenON.\nAt the beginning of each cycle, the main switch Q1 is\nturned ON by the rising edge of the internal oscillator clock.\nThe inductor current ramps up until the sum of the currentsense signal and compensation ramp becomes higher than\nthe error amplifier’s voltage. Once this has occurred, the\nPWM comparator resets the flip −flop, Q1 is turned OFF\nwhile the synchronous switch Q2 is turned ON. Q2 replaces\nthe external Schottky diode to reduce the conduction lossand improve the efficiency. To avoid overall power loss, acertain amount of dead time is introduced to ensure Q1 iscompletely turned OFF before Q2 is being turned ON.\nVOUT\nISW\nFigure 26. PWM Switching Waveforms\n(VIN = 3.6 V, V OUT = 1.2 V, I OUT = 600 mA,\nTemperature = 25 /C0053C)VSW\nPFM Operating Mode\nUnder light load conditions, the NCP1529 enters in low\ncurrent PFM mode of operation to reduce powerconsumption. The output regulation is implemented bypulse frequency modulation. If the output voltage dropsbelow the threshold of PFM comparator a new cycle will be\ninitiated by the PFM comparator to turn on the switch Q1.Q1 remains ON during the minimum on time of the structure\nwhile Q2 is in its current source mode. The peak inductor\ncurrent depends upon the drop between input and output\nvoltage. After a short dead time delay where Q1 is switched\nOFF, Q2 is turned in its ON state. The negative currentdetector will detect when the inductor current drops belowzero and sends a signal to turn Q2 to current source mode to\nprevent a too large dereg ulation of the ou tput voltag e. When\nthe output voltage falls below the threshold of the PFMcomparator, a new cycle starts immediately.\nVOUT\nISW\nFigure 27. PFM Switching Waveforms\n(VIN = 3.6 V, V OUT = 1.2 V, I OUT = 0 mA,\nTemperature = 25 /C0053C)VSW\nNCP1529\nwww. onsemi.com\n11Soft−Start\nThe NCP1529 uses soft −start to limit the inrush current\nwhen the device is initially powered up or enabled. Soft start\nis implemented by gradually increasing the referencevoltage until it reaches the full reference voltage. Duringstartup, a pulsed current source charges the internal\nsoft−start capacitor to provide gradually increasing\nreference voltage. When the voltage across the capacitorramps up to the nominal reference voltage, the pulsedcurrent source will be switched off and the reference voltage\nwill switch to the regular reference voltage.\nCycle−by−cycle Current Limitation\nFrom the block diagram, an I LIM comparator is used to\nrealize cycle −by−cycle current limit protection. The\ncomparator compares the SW pin voltage with the reference\nvoltage, which is biased by a constant current. If the inductor\ncurrent reaches the limit, the I LIM comparator detects the\nSW voltage falling below the reference voltage and releasesthe signal to turn off the switch Q1. The cycle −by−cycle\ncurrent limit is set at 1600 mA (nom).\nLow Dropout Operation\nThe NCP1529 offers a low input to output voltage\ndifference. The NCP1529 can operate at 100% duty cycle.\nIn this mode the PMOS (Q1) remains completely ON. The\nminimum input voltage to maintain regulation can be\ncalculated as:\nVout/C0043VOUT(max)/C0041/C0466IOUT/C0466RDS(on)_RINDUCTOR/C0467/C0467(eq. 1)\n•VOUT: Output V oltage (V)\n•IOUT: Max Output Current\n•RDS(on) : P−Channel Switch R DS(on)\n•RINDUCTOR : Inductor Resistance (DCR)\nUndervoltage Lockout\nThe Input voltage V IN must reach 2.4 V (typ) before the\nNCP1529 enables the DC/DC converter output to begin the\nstart up sequence (see soft −start section). The UVLO\nthreshold hysteresis is typically 100 mV .\nShutdown Mode\nForcing this pin to a voltage below 0.4 V will shut down\nthe IC. In shutdown mode, the internal reference, oscillatorand most of the control circuitries are turned off. Therefore,\nthe typical current consumption will be 0.3 /C0109A (typical\nvalue). Applying a voltage above 1.2 V to EN pin will enable\nthe DC/DC converter for normal operation. The device willgo through soft −start to normal operation.\nThermal Shutdown\nInternal Thermal Shutdown circuitry is provided to\nprotect the integrated circuit in the event that the maximum\njunction Temperature is exceeded. If the junctiontemperature exceeds 180 °C, the device shuts down. In this\nmode all power transistors and control circuits are turnedoff. The device restarts in soft −start after the temperature\ndrops below 140 °C. This feature is provided to prevent\ncatastrophic failures from accidental device overheating.\nShort Circuit Protection\nWhen the output is shorted to ground, the device limits the\ninductor current. The duty −cycle is minimum and the\nconsumption on the input line is 550 mA (typ). When the\nshort circuit condition is removed, the device returns to thenormal mode of operation.\nUSB or 5 V Rail Powered Applications\nFor USB or 5 V rail powered applications, NCP1529 is\nable to supply voltages up to 3.9 V , 600 mA, operating inPWM mode only, with high efficiency (Figure 28), lowoutput voltage ripple and good load regulation results overall current range (Figure 29).\n404550556065707580859095100\n0 200 400 600 800 1000EFFICIENCY (%)\nIOUT, OUTPUT CURRENT (mA)\nFigure 28.

If R2 is 200 k given the V FB is 0.6 V , the current\nthrough the divider will be 3.0 /C0109A.\nThe formula below gives the value of V OUT, given the\ndesired R1 and the R1 value:\nVout/C0043VFB/C0032(1/C0041R1/C0324R2) (eq. 2)\n•VOUT: Output V oltage (V)\n•VFB: Feedback V oltage = 0.6 V\n•R1: Feedback Resistor from V OUT to FB\n•R2: Feedback Resistor from FB to GNDInput Capacitor Selection\nIn PWM operating mode, the input current is pulsating\nwith large switching noise. Using an input bypass capacitor\ncan reduce the peak current transients drawn from the inputsupply source, thereby reducing switching noisesignificantly. The capacitance needed for the input bypass\ncapacitor depends on the source impedance of the input\nsupply.\nThe maximum RMS current occurs at 50% duty cycle\nwith maximum output current, which is IO, max/2.\nFor NCP1529, a low profile ceramic capacitor of 4.7 /C0109F\nshould be used for most of the cases. For effective bypassresults, the input capacitor should be placed as close aspossible to the VIN Pin\nTable 1.

The correct selection of theoutput filter ensures good stability and fast transientresponse.\nDue to the nature of the buck converter, the output L −C\nfilter must be selected to work with internal compensation.\nFor NCP1529, the internal compensation is internally fixed\nand it is optimized for an output filter of L = 2.2 /C0109H and\nC\nOUT = 10 /C0109F.\nThe corner frequency is given by:\nf/C00431\n2/C0112L/C0032COUT/C0504/C00431\n2/C01122.2/C0109H/C003210/C0109F /C0504/C004334 kHz\n(eq. 3)\nThe device operates with inductance value of 2.2 /C0109H. If\nthe corner frequency is moved, it is recommended to checkthe loop stability depending of the accepted output ripplevoltage and the required output current. Take care to checkthe loop stability. The phase margin is usually higher than45°.\nTable 2.

For best performances, the DC\nresistance should be less than 0.3 /C0087 for good efficiency.\nNCP1529\nwww. onsemi.com\n13Table 3.

A minimum 18 pFfeed-forward capacitor is needed to ensure loop stability.Having feed-forward capacitor of 1 nF or higher can\nincrease soft−start time and reduce inrush current. Choose a\nsmall ceramic capacitor X7R or X5R or COG dielectric.\nNCP1529\nwww. onsemi.com\n14LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS\nElectrical Layout Considerations\nImplementing a high frequency DC −DC converter\nrequires respect of some rules to get a powerful portableapplication. Good layout is key to prevent switchingregulators to generate noise to application and tothemselves.\nElectrical layout guide lines are:\n•Use short and large traces when large amount of current\nis flowing.\n•Keep the same ground reference for input and output\ncapacitors to minimize the loop formed by high current\npath from the battery to the ground plane.\n•Isolate feedback pin from the switching pin and the\ncurrent loop to protect against any external parasitic\nsignal coupling. Add a feed −forward capacitor between\nVOUT and FB which adds a zero to the loop and\nparticipates to the good loop stability. A 18 pFcapacitor is recommended to meet compensation\nrequirements.\nA four layer PCB with a ground plane and a power plane\nwill help NCP1529 noise immunity and loop stability.\nThermal Layout Considerations\nHigh power dissipation in small package leads to thermal\nconsideration such as:\n•Enlarge V IN trace and added several vias connected to\npower plane.\n•Connect GND pin to top plane.\n•Join top, bottom and each ground plane together usingseveral free vias in order to increase radiator size.\nFor high ambient temperature and high power dissipation\nrequirements, UDFN6 package using exposed pad\nconnected to main radiator is recommended. Refer toNotes 7, 8, and 9.\nFigure 30. TSOP −5 Recommended Board Layout\n Figure 31.
