a GFSK  transceiver  operating  in \nthe world wide ISM frequency band at 2400- \n2483.5 MHz.  Burst mode transmission and up \nto 2Mbps air data  rate make them suitable for \napplicati ons requiring   ultra low power \nconsumption.   The  embedd ed packet \nprocessing  engines enable their full operation \nwith a very simple  MCU  as a radio system. \nAuto  re-transmission  and  auto  acknowle dge \ngive reliable  link witho ut  any  MCU \ninterference. \n \nRFM75  operates  in TDD  mode,  either  as a \ntransmitter or as a receiver. \n \nThe   RF  channel   frequency   determines   the \ncenter  of the channel  used  by RFM75.  The \nfrequency  is  set  by  the  RF_CH  register  in \nregister bank 0 according to the following \nformula:  F0=  2400  +  RF_CH  (MH z).  The resolution  of  the  RF  channel  frequency  is \n1MHz. \n \nA transmitter and a receiver must be \nprogramme d with   the   same   RF   channel \nfrequency  to  be  able  to  communicate  with \neach other. \n \nThe  output  power  of  RFM75  is  set  by  the \nRF_PWR bits in the RF_SETUP register. \n \nDemodulati on   is  done  with  embedded  data \nslicer and bit recovery logic. The air data rate \ncan  be  programmed  to  250Kbps,  1Mbps  or \n2Mbps by RF_DR_HIGH   and RF_DR_LOW \nregister. A transmitter and a receiver must be \nprogrammed with the same setting.  \n \nIn the following  chapters,  all registers are in \nregister bank 0 except with explicit claim. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1 RFM75  Chip  Block Diagram \n \n E‐mail:sales@hoper f.com website://ww w.hoper f.com Page  4 of 27  \n RFM 75 V2.0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 Abbrevi ations  \n \nACK Acknowledgement \nARC  Auto Retrans mission  Count \nARD  Auto Retransmission  Delay \nCD  Carrier Detection  \nCE Chip Enable \nCRC Cyclic Redundancy Check \nCSN Chip Select Not \nDPL  Dyna mic Payload Length  \nFIFO First-In-First-Out \nGFSK Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying \nGHz Gigahertz \nLNA  Low Noise Amp lifier \nIRQ Interrupt Requ est \nISM  Industrial-Scientific-Medical \nLSB  Least  Significant Bit \nMAX_RT   Maximum Retransmit \nMbps  Megabit per second \nMCU  Microcontroller Unit \nMHz   Mega hertz \nMISO  Master In Slave Out \nMOSI Master Out Slave In \nMSB  Most Significant Bit \nPA Power Amp lifier \nPID Packet Identity Bits \nPLD  Payload \nPRX  Primary RX \nPTX   Primary TX \nPWD_DWN  Power Dow n \nPWD_UP  Power Up \nRF_CH Radio Frequency Chan nel \nRSSI Received Signal Strength Indicator \nRX Receive \nRX_DR Receive Data Ready \nSCK SPI Clock \nSPI Serial Peripheral Interface \nTDD Time Division Duplex \nTX Transmit \nTX_DS  Transmit Data  Sent \nXTAL Crystal \nRFM 75 V2.0 \nE‐mail:sales@hoper f.com website://ww w.hoper f.com Page  5 of 27  \n \n \nNC  CDVDD     VDD  VSS V DD \n \n20  19  18 17 16 \n \nCE 1  15     VDD \nCSN 2  14     V SS \nSCK 3  R F M7 5 13 RF \n \nMOSI  4  12 NC \nMISO  5   11  NC \n \n6  7  8  9 10 \n \nIRQ  NC  NC XO XI \n \n  \n \n3 Pin Information  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure  2 RFM75C  / RFM75  pin assignm ents (top view) \n \n \n \nTable 1 RFM75C/RFM75  pin functions \nRFM 75 V2.0 \nE‐mail:sales@hoper f.com website://ww w.hoper f.com Page  6 of 27  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n4 State Control \n \n4.1 State  Control Diagram \n \n* Pin signal: VDD, CE \n* SPI register: PWR_UP, PRIM_RX,  \nEN_AA, NO_ACK, ARC, ARD  \n* System   information:   Time   out,   ACK  \nreceived,  ARD  elapsed,  A RC_CNT,  TX \nFIFO  empty, ACK p acket transmitted, \nPacket received RFM75 has   built-in state machines that \ncontrol the state transition between different \nmodes. \n \nWhen  auto  acknowl edge  feature  is  disabled, \nstate  transit ion  will  be  fully  controlled   by \nMCU. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigu re 3 PTX (PRIM _RX=0) state control diagram \nRFM 75 V2.0 \n \n E‐mail:sales@hoper f.com website://ww w.hoper f.com Page  7 of 27  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure  4 PRX (PRIM_RX=1) state control diagram  \n \n \n \n \n4.2 Power Down Mode  \n \nIn  power  down  mode  RFM75  is  in  sleep \nmode with minimal current consumption. SPI \ninterface  is still  active  in this  mode,  and all \nregister  values  are  a vailable  by  SPI.  Power \ndown mode is entered by setting the PWR_UP \nbit in the CONFIG register to low. \n \n \n4.3 Standby -I Mode \n \nBy setting  the PWR_UP  bit in the CONFIG \nregister  to  1  and  de-asserting  CE  to  0,  the \ndevice enters standby-I mode. Standby-I mode \nis used to minimize average current \nconsumption  while maintaining  short start-up \ntime. In this mode, part of the crystal oscillator \nis  active.  This  is  also  the  mode  which  the \nRFM75 returns to from TX or RX  mode when \nCE is set low. 4.4 Stand by-II Mode  \n \nIn  standby-II  mode  more  clock  buffers  are \nactive than in standby-I mode and much more \ncurrent is used. Standby-II occurs when CE is \nheld  high  on  a PTX  device  with  empty  TX \nFIFO. If a new packet  is uploaded  to the TX \nFIFO in this mode, the device will \nautomatically enter TX mode and the packet is \ntransmitted. \n \n \n4.5 TX Mode \n \n* PTX device (PRIM_RX=0) \n \nThe  TX  mode  is  an  active  mode  where  the \nPTX  device  transmits  a packet.  To enter this \nmode from power down mode, the PTX device \nmust have the   PWR_UP bit   set   high, \nPRIM _RX  bit set low,  a payload  in the TX \nFIFO,  and a high pulse on the CE for more \nthan 10µ s. \nRFM 75 V2.0 \n \n E‐mail:sales@hoper f.com website://ww w.hoper f.com Page  8 of 27  \n \n \n \n \nThe PTX device stays in TX mode until it \nfinishes transmitting the current packet . If CE \n= 0 it returns to standby-I mode. If CE = 1, the \nnext action is determined by the status  of the \nTX FIFO. If the TX FIFO  is not empty  the \nPTX  device remains in TX mode, transmitting \nthe next packet. If the TX FIFO is empty the \nPTX device  goes into standby -II  mode. It is \nimportant to never stay in TX  mode for more \nthan 4ms at one time. \n \nIf the auto retransmit  is enabled (EN_AA=1) \nand auto acknowledge is required \n(NO_ACK=0),  the PTX device will enter TX \nmode   from   standby-I    mode   when   ARD \nelapsed  and  number  of  retried  is  less  than \nARC. \n \n* PRX device  (PRIM_RX=1) \n \nThe PRX device will enter TX mode from RX \nmode only when EN_AA=1  and NO_ ACK=0 \nin received packet to tr ansmit ackn owledge \npacket with pending payload in TX FIFO. \n \n \n4.6 RX Mode \n \n* PRX device  (PRIM_RX=1) \n \nThe RX mode is an active mode where  the \nRFM75 radio is configured  to be a receiver. \nTo enter this mode from standby-I mode, the \nPRX  d evice  must have  the PWR_UP  bit set \n \n5 Packet Proces sing high, PRIM_RX  bit set high and the CE pin \nset high. Or PRX device can enter this mode \nfrom TX mode after transmitting an \nacknowledge   packe t   when   EN_AA=1   and \nNO_ ACK=0 in received packet.  \n \nIn  this  mode  the  receiver  demodulat es   the \nsignals from  the RF channel, constantly \npresenting the demodulated data to the packet \nprocessing   engine.   The   packet   processing \nengine   continuously   searches   for   a   valid \npacket.   If  a  valid   packet   is  found   (by  a \nmatching   address   and   a   valid   CRC)   the \npayload of the packet is presented in a vacant \nslot in the RX FIFO. If the RX FIFO is full, \nthe received packet is discarded. \n \nThe PRX  device remains in RX  mode until the \nMCU   configures   it  to  standby-I   mode   or \npower down mode.  \n \nIn RX mode a carrier detection (CD) signal is \navailable.   The CD is set to high when a RF \nsignal    is  detected inside the receiving \nfrequency  channel. The internal CD signal is \nfiltered  before presented  to CD register.  The \nRF signal must be present for at least 128 µ s \nbefore the CD is set high.  \n \n* PTX device (PRIM_RX=0) \n \nThe PTX device will enter RX mode from TX \nmode only when EN_AA=1 and NO_ACK=0 \nto receive acknowledge packe t. \n \n5.1 Packet Format  \nThe packet format has a preamble, address, packet control, payload and CRC field. \n \n \nPreamble1byte  \nAddress3~5byte  \nPacket Control 9/0bit  \nPayload0~32byte  \nCRC2/1byte \n \n \n \n \nPayloadLength6bit PID2bit NO_ACK1bit \n \nFigu re 5 Packet Format \nRFM 75 V2.0 \n \n E‐mail:sales@hoper f.com website://ww w.hoper f.com Page  9 of 27  \n \n \n \n \n5.1.1 Preamble \n \nThe preamble is a bit sequence used to detect 0 \nand 1 levels in the receiver. The preamble is \none  byte  long  and  is  either  01010101   or \n10101010. If the first bit in the address is 1 the \npreamble is automatically set to 10101010 and \nif the first bit is 0 the preamble is \nautomatically set to 01010101. This is done to \nensure  there are enough  transitions  in the \npreamble to stabilize the receiver. \n \n \n5.1.2 Address \n \nThis is the address for the receiver. An address \nensures that the packet is detected by the target \nreceiver. The address field can be configured \nto be 3, 4, or 5 bytes long by the AW register. \n \nThe PRX device can open up to six data pipes \nto support up to six PTX  devices  with unique \naddresses .  All  six PTX  device  addresse s  are \nsearched simultaneously. In PRX side, the data \npipes are enabled with the bits in the \nEN_RXADDR  register.  By defau lt  only data \npipe 0 and 1 are enabled. \n \nEach  data  pipe  addre ss  is  configur ed  in  the \nRX_ ADDR_PX registers. \n \nEach  pipe can have up to 5 bytes  configurable \naddress.  Data  pipe  0  has  a  unique  5  byte \naddress. Data pipes 1-5 share the 4 most \nsignific ant address bytes. The LSB byte must \nbe unique for all 6 pipes. \n \nTo ensure that the ACK packet from the PRX \nis  transmitted  to  the  correct  PTX,  the  PRX \ntakes the data pipe address where it received \nthe packet and uses it as the TX address when \ntransmitting the ACK packet. \n \nOn the PRX,  the RX_ADDR_Pn ,  defined  as \nthe pipe address, must be unique. On the PTX \nthe TX_ADDR must be the same as the \nRX_A DDR_P0   on the PTX, and as the pipe \naddress for the designated pipe on the PRX.  No other data pipe can receive data until a \ncomplete packet is received by a data pipe that \nhas detected  its address.  When  multiple  PTX \ndevices  are transmitting  to a PRX, the ARD \ncan be used to skew the auto retransmission so \nthat they only block each other once. \n \n \n5.1.3 Packet Control \n \nWhen D ynamic Payload Length function is \nenabled,  the packet control field contains a 6 \nbit payload  length field, a 2 bit PID (Packet \nIdentity) field and, a 1 bit NO_ACK  flag. \n \n* Payload length \nThe payload  length  field  is only  used  if the \nDynamic Payload  Length function is enabled.  \n \n* PID \nThe 2 bit PID field is used to detect whether \nthe  received  packet  is  new  or  retransmitted. \nPID prevents the PRX  device from presenting \nthe same payload more than once to the MCU. \nThe PID field is incremented  at the TX side \nfor each new packet received through the SPI. \nThe PID and CRC fields are used by the PRX \ndevice to determine whether a packet is old or \nnew. When several data packets are lost on the \nlink, the PID fields may become equal to the \nlast received PID. If a packet has the same PID \nas the previous  packet,  RF M75  compares  the \nCRC  sums  from  both  packets.  If  the  CRC \nsums are also equal, the last received packet is \nconsidered  a copy of the previously  received \npacket and discarded. \n \n* NO_ACK \nThe NO_ACK flag is only  used when the auto \nacknowledgement   feature  is used. Setting the \nflag high, tells the receiver that the packet is \nnot to be auto acknowledged. \n \nThe PTX can set the NO_ACK flag bit in  the \nPacket Control Field with the comma nd: \nW_TX_PAYLOAD_NO ACK. However,   the \nfunction  must first   be enabled in the \nFEA TURE register by  setting the \nRFM 75 V2.0 \n \n E‐mail:sales@hoper f.com website://ww w.hoper f.com Page  10 of 27  \n \n \n \nEN_DY N_ACK bit. W hen you use this option, \nthe PTX goes direc tly to st andby-I mode after \ntransmitting  the packet and the PRX does not \ntransmit  an  ACK  packet  when  it receives  the \npacket. \n \n5.1.4 Payload \n \nThe payload is the user defined conte nt of the \npacket. It can be 0 to 32 bytes wide,  and it is \ntransmitted on-air as it is uploaded \n(unmodified) to the device. \n \nThe RFM75 provides two alternat ives for \nhandling payload lengths, static and dynamic \npayload  length.  The  static  payload  length  of \neach of six data pipes  can be individually  set. \n \nThe default alternative is static payload length. \nWith static  payload length all packets betwe en \na  transmitter  and  a  receiver  have  the  same \nlength. Static payload length is set  by the \nRX_PW_Px  registers. The payload length on \nthe  transmitter  side  is  set  by  the  number  of \nbytes  clocked  into  the  TX_FI FO  and  must \nequal the value in the RX_PW_Px  register on \nthe   receiver   side.   Each   pipe   has   its  own \npayload length. \n \nDynamic   Payload Length (DPL) is an \nalternative   to   static   payload   length.   DPL \nenables the transmitter to send packets with \nvariable  payload  length  to the recei ver.  This \nmeans for a system  with different paylo ad \nlengths it is not necessary to scale the packet \nlength to the longest payload. \n \nWith DPL feature the RFM75 can decode the \npayload length of the received packet \nautomatically  instead of using the RX_PW_Px \nregisters. The MCU  can read the len gth of the \nreceived payload by using  the comma nd: \nR_RX _PL_WID. \n \nIn order to enable DPL the EN_DPL  bit in the \nFEATURE register must be set. In RX mode \nthe DY NPD register has to be set. A PTX that \ntransmits  to  a PRX  with  DPL  enabled  must \nhave the DPL_P0  bit in DYNPD  set. 5.1.5 CRC  \n \nThe CRC is the error detection  mechanism in \nthe packet. The number of bytes in the CRC  is \nset by the CRC O bit in the CONF IG register. \nIt may be either 1 or 2 bytes and is calculated \nover the address, Packet Control Field, and \nPayload. \n \nThe polynomial for 1 byte CRC is X8  + X2  + \nX + 1. Initial value is 0xFF.  \nThe polynomial for 2 byte CRC  is X16  + X12  + \nX5 + 1. Initial value is 0xFFFF.  \n \nNo packet is accepted by receiver side if the \nCRC fails. \n \n \n5.2 Packet Handling \n \nRFM75 uses burst mode for payload \ntransmission and receive. \n \nThe transmitter fetches payload from TX  FIFO, \nautomatically assembles it into packet and \ntransmits   the  packet   in  a  very  short  burst \nperiod with 1Mbps or 2Mbp s air data rate. \n \nAfter transmission, if the PTX packet has the \nNO_ACK  flag set, RFM75 sets TX_DS and \ngives an active low interrupt IRQ to MCU. If \nthe   PTX   is   A CK   packet,   the   PTX   needs \nreceive  ACK  fr om the PRX  and  th en  asserts \nthe TX_DS IRQ. \n \nThe receiver automatically validates and \ndisassembles   received  packet,  if  there  is  a \nvalid  packet  within  the new  payload,  it will \nwrite the payload into RX FIFO,  set RX_DR \nand give an active low interr upt IRQ to MCU. \n \nWhen auto  acknowledge   is enabled \n(EN_AA=1),  the PTX devic ewill \nautomatically   wait  for  acknowledge   packet \nafter   transmission,   and   re-transmit   original \npacket   with   the   delay   of   ARD   until   an \nacknowledge packet is received or the number \nof re-transmission exceeds a threshold ARC. If \nthe   later   one   happens,   RFM75   will   set \nMAX_RT  and  give  an  active  low  interrupt \nRFM 75 V2.0 \n \n E‐mail:sales@hoper f.com website://ww w.hoper f.com Page  11 of 27  \n \n \n \n \nIRQ to MCU. Two packet loss counters \n(ARC_CNT  and PLOS_CNT) are incremented \neach  time  a  packet  is  lost.  The  ARC_CNT \ncounts the number  of retransmissions  for the \ncurrent  transaction.  The  PLOS_CNT  counts \nthe total number of retransmissions   since the \nlast channel change. ARC_CNT is reset by \ninitiating  a  new  transaction.  PLOS_CNT  is \nreset by writing to the RF_CH  register.  It is \npossible to   use    the    information in   the \nOBSERVE_TX register to make an overall \nassessment of the chann el quality. \n \nThe PTX device will retransmit if its RX FIFO \nis full but received  ACK frame has payload. \n \nAs an alternative for PTX device to auto \nretran smit it is possible to manually set the \nRFM75  to retransmit  a packet  a  number  of \ntimes. This is done by the REUSE_TX_PL \ncommand.  \n \nWhen  auto  acknowledge  is enabled,  the PRX \ndevice will automatically  check the NO_ACK \nfield in received packet, and if NO_ACK =0, it \nwill automatically send an acknowledge \npacket to PTX device. If EN_ACK_PAY is set, \nand the acknowl edge   pack et can also include \npending payload in TX FIFO. \n \n \n6 Data and Control I nterface  \n \n6.1 TX/RX FIFO \n \nThe data FIFOs are used to store payload that \nis to be transmitted (TX FIFO) or payload that \nis received  and ready  to be clocked out (RX \nFIFO).  The  FIFO  is accessible  in both  PTX \nmode and PRX mode. \n \nThere are three levels 32 bytes FIFO  for both \nTX  and  RX,  supporting  both  acknowle dge \nmode or no acknowled ge mode with up to six \npipes. \n \n* TX three levels,  32 byte FIFO \n* RX three levels, 32 byte FIFO \n \nBoth   FIFOs   have   a   controller and   are accessible throu gh the SPI by using  dedicated \nSPI commands. A TX FIFO in PRX can store \npayload  for  ACK  packets  to  three  different \nPTX  devices.  If the TX FIFO  contains  more \nthan  one  payload   to  a  pipe,  payloads  are \nhandled  using  the first in first out princip le. \nThe  TX  FIFO  in  a  PRX  is  blocked  if  all \npending payloads are addressed to pipes where \nthe link  to the PTX  is  lost.  In this  case,  the \nMCU can flush the TX FIFO by using the \nFLUSH_TX command. \n \nThe  RX FIFO  in PRX  may  contain  payload \nfrom up to three different PTX devices. \n \nA TX FIFO  in PTX can have up to three \npayloads stored.  \n \nThe  TX  FIFO  can  be  written  to  by  three \ncomma nds, W_TX_PAYLOA D and \nW_TX_PAYLOAD_NO _ACK   in PTX  mode \nand W_ACK_PAYLO AD   in PRX mode. All \nthree commands  give access to the TX_PLD \nregis ter. \n \nThe RX FIFO can be read by the command \nR_RX_PAYL OAD   in  both  PTX  and  PRX \nmode. This command gives access to the \nRX_PLD register. \n \nThe payload  in TX FIFO in a PTX  is NOT \nremoved  if the MAX_RT IRQ is asserted. \n \nIn the FIFO_STATUS register it is possible to \nread if the TX and RX FIFO are full or empty. \nThe  TX_REUSE  bit  is  also  available  in  the \nFIFO_S TATUS register. TX_REUSE  is set by \nthe  SPI  command   REU SE_TX_ PL,   and  is \nreset by the SPI command: \nW_TX_PAYLOAD or FLUSH TX. \n \n6.2 Interrupt  \n \nIn  RF M75  there  is  an  a ctive  low  interrupt \n(IRQ)  pin,  which  is  acti vated  when  TX_DS \nIRQ, RX_DR IRQ or MAX_RT  IRQ are set \nhigh by the state machine in the STATUS \nregister. The IRQ pin resets when MCU writes \n'1'  to  the  IRQ  source  bit  in  the  STATUS  \nregister.   The   IRQ   mask   in   the   CONFIG \nRFM 75 V2.0 \nE‐mail:sales@hoper f.com website://ww w.hoper f.com Page  12 of 27  \n \n \n \n \nregister is used to select the IRQ sources that \nare allowed to assert the IRQ pin. By setting \none of the MASK bits high, the corresponding \nIRQ source is disabled. By default all IRQ \nsources are enabled. \n \nThe 3 bit pipe information in the STATUS \nregister is updated during the IRQ pin high to \nlow transition. If the STATUS  register is read \nduring an IRQ pin high to low transition, the \npipe information  is unreliable. \n \n \n6.3 SPI Interface  \n \n6.3.1 SPI Command \n \nThe  SPI  commands  are  shown  in  Table  3. \nEvery new comm and must be started  by a high to low transition on CSN.  \n \nIn parallel to the SPI command word  applied \non  the  MOSI  pin,  the  STATUS  register  is \nshifted serially out on the MISO pin. \n \nThe serial shifting SPI commands is in the \nfollowing format: \n \n* <Command  word:  MSB  bit  to  LSB  bit \n(one byte)> \n* <Data  bytes:  LSB  byte  to  MSB  byte, \nMSB   bit   in   each   byte   first>   for   all \nregisters   at  bank  0  and  register   9  to \nregister 14 at bank 1 \n* <Data  bytes:  MSB  byte  to  LSB  byte, \nMSB  bit in each byte first> for register 0 \nto register 8 at bank 1 \n \n \nCommand name  Command \nword \n(binary)   \n# Data \nbytes  \nOperati on \n \nR_REGISTER  \n000A  AAAA  1 to 5 \nLSB byte first Read  command and status registers.
