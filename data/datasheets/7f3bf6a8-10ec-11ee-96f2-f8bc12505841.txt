It is a low-power device with companding options and programming features, andit meets the requirements for communication systems, including the cellular phone. The device operates ineither the 15-bit linear or 8-bit companded ( µ-law or A-Law) mode, which is selectable through the I\n2C interface.\nA coder, an analog-to-digital converter or ADC, digitizes the analog voice signal, and a decoder, a\ndigital-to-analog converter or DAC, converts the digital-voice signal to an analog output. The PCM codecprovides a companding option to overcome the bandwidth limitations of telephone networks without degradingthe sound quality. The human auditory system is a logarithmic system in which high amplitude signals requireless resolution than low amplitude signals. Therefore, an 8-bit code word with nonuniform quantization ( µ-law\nor A-law) has the same quality as 13-bit linear coding. The PCM codec provides better digital code words bygenerating a 15-bit linear coding option.\nThe human voice is effective from a frequency range of 300 Hz to 3300 Hz in telephony applications. In order\nto eliminate unwanted signals, the PCM codec design has two types of filters that operate in both the transmitand receive path. A low-pass filter attenuates the signals over 4 kHz. A selectable high-pass filter cleans up thesignals under 100 Hz. This reduces noise that may have coupled in from 50/60-Hz power cables. The high-passfilter is bypassed by selecting the corresponding register bit.\nThe PCM codec has many programming features that are controlled using a 2-wire standard serial I\n2C interface.\nThis allows the device to interface with many digital ICs such as a DSP or a microprocessor. The device hasseven registers: power control, mode control, transmit PGA, receive PGA, high DTMF, low DTMF, and auxiliarymode control. Some of the programmable features that can be controlled by I\n2C interface include:\n/C0068Transmit amplifier gain\n/C0068Receive amplifier gain\n/C0068Sidetone gain\n/C0068Volume control\n/C0068Earphone control\n/C0068PLL power control\n/C0068Microphone selection\n/C0068Transmit channel high-pass filter control\n/C0068Receive channel high-pass filter control\n/C0068Companding options and selection control\n/C0068PCM loopback\n/C0068DTMF control\n/C0068Pulse density modulated control\nThe PCM codec is also capable of generating its own internal clocks from a 2.048-MHz master clock input.\nTLV320AIC1110  \nSLAS359 – DECEMBER 2001\n3 www.ti.comPBS PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\n3130292827\n910PCMO\nPCMI\nDVSS\nDVDD\nSCLSDA\nMUXOUT2\nMUXOUT1PLLV\nDD\nEARVSS\nEAR1ON\nEARVDD\nEAR1OP\nEARVSS\nEAR2O\nAVDD3226\n1112131415MBIAS\nMIC1P\nMIC1N\nMIC2P\nMUXIN16 25\n1234567824 23 22 21 20 19 18 17\nMIC2N\nREXT\nAVSSMCLKPLLVSS\nVSS\nRESET\nPWRUPSEL\nBUZZCON\nPCMSYN\nPCMCLK\nTLV320AIC1110  \nSLAS359 – DECEMBER 2001\n4 www.ti.com98765\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF321\nG\nH\nJ4\nAVDD\nBUZZCON\nPCMSYN\nPCMCLK\nPCMOMUXINMBIAS\nRESETMCLK\nPWRUPSEL\nAVSSMIC2PMIC1P\nMIC1N\nREXTMIC2NNC NC\nNC\nNC\nNC\nNC\nNC\nNC NC NC NC NCNC NC NCNC NC NCNC NC NCNC NCNC NC NCVSSNC NCNC\nNCNCNC\nNC\nNCNC NC\nNCNC NC\nNC NCNC\nNCNC\nNC\nNC NCNC\nPLLVSSPLLVDDEARVSSEAR1ONEAR1OPEARVSSEAR2O\nMUXOUT1\nMUXOUT2\nSDA\nSCL\nDVDD\nDVSS\nPCMIEARVDDMicroStar Junior \uf8ea (GQE) PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\nTLV320AIC1110  \nSLAS359 – DECEMBER 2001\n5 www.ti.comfunctional block diagram\nPCMIN\nPCMSYN\nPCMCLK\nMIC1P\nMIC1N\nMIC2P\nMIC2NMIC\nAmplifier\n1\ng =\n23.5 dBMIC\nAmplifier\n2\ng = 6\nor\n18 dBAnalog\nModulatorTX Filter\nand PGA\ng = –10 dB\nto\n0 dBPCM\nInterface\nSidetone\ng = –24 db\nto\n–12 dBRX Vol\nControl\ng = –18 dB\nto\n0 dB\nRX Filter\nand PGA\ng = – 6 dB\nto\n+6 dBDigital\nModulator\nand FilterEar\nAmp1\nEar\nAmp2\nDTMF\nGeneratorControl Bus\nREF PLLBuzzer\nControl\nPower and RESET\nSCLKSDATAMBIASREXTMCLKRESETSSEARVDDEARVSSPLLVDDPLLVSSDVDDDVSSAVDDAVSSVPWRUPSELPCMOUT\nEAR1OP\nEAR1ON\nEAR2O\nBUZZCONDTMF\nGAIN\nDTMFVoice\n0 dB\nor\n6 dB\nMUX\n–12 to\n12 dB\nin 6dB\nSteps\nI  CMUX INOUT\nOUT\nI/F2\nTLV320AIC1110  \nSLAS359 – DECEMBER 2001\n6 www.ti.comdetailed description\npower on/reset\nThe power for the various digital and analog circuits is separated to improve the noise performance of the\ndevice. An external reset must be applied to the active low RESET  terminal to assure reset upon power on and\nto bring the device to an operational state. After the initial power-on sequence, the device can be functionallypowered up and powered down by writing to the power control register through the I\n2C interface. The device\nhas a pin-selectable power up in the default mode option. The hardwired pin-selectable PWRUPSEL functionallows the PCM codec to power up in the default mode and to be used without a microcontroller.\nreference\nA precision band gap reference voltage is generated internally and supplies all required voltage references to\noperate the transmit and receive channels. The reference system also supplies bias voltage for use with anelectret microphone at terminal MBIAS. An external precision resistor is required for reference current settingat terminal REXT.\nI\n2C control interface\nThe I2C interface is a two-wire bidirectional serial interface. The I 2C interface controls the PCM codec by writing\ndata to seven control registers:\n/C0068Power control\n/C0068Mode control\n/C0068Transmit PGA and sidetone control\n/C0068Receive PGA gain and volume control\n/C0068DTMF routing\n/C0068Tone selection control\n/C0068Auxiliary control\nThere are two power-up modes which may be selected at the PWRUPSEL terminal: (1) The PWRUPSEL state\n(VDD at terminal 20) causes the device to power up in the default mode when power is applied. Without an I 2C\ninterface or controlling device, the programmable functions are fixed at the default gain levels, and functionssuch as the sidetone and DTMF are not accessible. (2) The PWRUPSEL state (ground at terminal 20) causesthe device to go to a power-down state when power is applied. In this mode, an I\n2C interface is required to power\nup the device.\nphase-locked loop (PLL)\nThe phase-lock loop generates the internal clock frequency required for digital filters and modulators by phase\nlocking to 2.048-MHz master clock input.\nPCM interface\nThe PCM interface transmits and receives data at the PCMO and PCMI terminals respectively. The data is\ntransmitted or received at the PCMCLK speed once every PCMSYN cycle. The PCMCLK can be tied directlyto the 128-kHz or 2.048-MHz master clock (MCLK). The PCMSYN can be driven by an external source orderived from the master clock and used as an interrupt to the host controller.\nmicrophone amplifiers\nThe microphone input is a switchable interface for two differential microphone inputs. The first stage is a\nlow-noise differential amplifier that provides a gain of 23.5 dB. The second-stage amplifier has a selectable gainof 6 dB or 18 dB.\nTLV320AIC1110  \nSLAS359 – DECEMBER 2001\n7 www.ti.comdetailed description (continued)\nanalog modulator\nThe transmit channel modulator is a third-order sigma-delta design.\ntransmit filter and PGA\nThe transmit filter is a digital filter designed to meet CCITT G.714 requirements. The device operates either in\nthe 15-bit linear or 8-bit companded µ-law or in the A-law mode, which is selectable through the I 2C interface.\nThe transmit PGA defaults to 0 dB.\nsidetone\nA portion of the transmitted audio is attenuated and fed back to the receive channel through the sidetone path.\nThe sidetone path defaults to the mute condition. The default gain of -12 dB is set in the sidetone control register.The sidetone path can be enabled by writing to the power control register.\nreceive volume control\nThe receive volume control block acts as an attenuator with a range of –18 dB to 0 dB in 2-dB steps for control\nof the receive channel volume. The receive volume control gain defaults to 0 dB.\nreceive filter and PGA\nThe receive filter is a digital filter that meets CCITT G.714 requirements with a high-pass filter that is selectable\nthrough the I\n2C interface. The device operates either in the 15-bit linear or the 8-bit µ-law or the A-law\ncompanded mode, which is selectable through the I 2C interface. The gain defaults to –4 dB, representing a\n3-dBm level for a 32- Ω load impedance and the corresponding digital full scale PCMI code.\ndigital modulator and filter\nThe second-order digital modulator and filter convert the received digital PCM data to the analog output required\nby the earphone interface.\nearphone amplifiers\nThe analog signal can be routed to either of two earphone amplifiers, one with differential output (EAR1ON and\nEAR1OP) and one with single-ended output (EAR2O). Clicks and pops are suppressed for EAR1 differentialoutput only.\ntone generator\nThe tone generator provides generation of standard DTMF tones which are output to (1) the buzzer driver, as\na PDM signal, (2) the receive path DAC for outputting through the earphone, or (3) as PCMO data. The integervalue is loaded into one of two 8-bit registers, the high-tone register (04), or the low-tone register (05) (see theRegister Map Addressing  section). The tone output is 2 dB higher when applied to the high tone register (04).\nThe high DTMF tones must be applied to the high-tone register, and the low DTMF tones to the low-tone register.The tone signals can be generated with three different resolutions at ∆F= 7.8125Hz, 15.625 Hz, and 31.250Hz.\nThe resolution option can be selected by setting the register (06).\nanalog mux\nThe analog switch can be used to source an analog signal to two different loads. The output can be reselected\nby setting the auxiliary register (06).\nTLV320AIC1110  \nSLAS359 – DECEMBER 2001\n8 www.ti.comdetailed description (continued)\nDTMF gain MUX\nThe DTMF gain MUX selects the signal path and applies the appropriate gain setting. Therefore the device is\neither in tone mode or in voice mode. When set in the voice mode, the gain is controlled by the auxiliary registerand is set to 0 dB or 6 dB. When set in the tone mode, the gain is from –12 dB to 12 dB in 6-dB steps which\nis set by the volume control register. The gain setting is controlled by the RXPGA register. This will not createany control contention since the device is working in one mode at a time.\nTerminal Functions\nTERMINAL †\nNAMENO.

If during apulse code modulation (PCM)  data transmit cycle an asynchronous power down occurs, the PCM interface\nremains powered up until the PCM data is completely transferred.\nAn additional power-down mode overrides the MCLK detection function. This allows the device to enter the\npower down state without regard to MCLK. Setting bit 7 of the TXPGA sidetone register to logic high enablesthis function.\ninternal reference current setting terminal\nUse a 100-k Ω precision resistor to connect the REXT pin to GND.\nconversion laws\nThe device can be programmed for either a 15-bit linear or and 8-bit (µ-law or A-law) companding mode.

The integer value is determined by the formula round tone [Freq (Hz)/resolution(Hz)]. The integer value is loaded into one of two 8-bit registers, high-tone register (04) or low-tone register (05).The tone output is 2 dB higher when applied to the high-tone register (04). When generating DTMF tones, thehigh-frequency value must be applied to the high tone register (04) and the low DTMF value to the low-toneregister.\nThe DTMF frequency resolution is controlled by the auxiliary register (06) bits 2, 3, 4, and 5. When the resolution\nis set to 7.8125 Hz, the frequency range can be up to 1992.2 Hz. A wider range can be accomplished (forexample, 2x or 4x) by selecting lower resolutions of 15.625 Hz or 31.250 Hz. The gain setting is controlled bythe RXPGA gain control. This register applies the required gain to obtain MUX control during tone modeoperation. Table 3 shows the relationship of the two gain settings.\nTLV320AIC1110  \nSLAS359 – DECEMBER 2001\n29 www.ti.comPRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\nDTMF generator operation and interface (continued)\nTable 7.

The values that determine the tone frequency are loaded into the tone registers (highand low) as two separate values.\nThe values loaded into the tone registers initiate an iterative table look-up function, placing a 6-bit or 7-bit in\ntwos-complement value into the the tone registers. There is a 2-dB difference in the resulting output of the tworegisters, the high-tone register having the greater result.\nIn the case of low-tone signal, the tone generator outputs a 6-bit integer with a maximum code of 31 (01 1111).\nHowever, the DTMF output is an 8-bit integer. Therefore, two zeros are padded to the MSB position, whichresults in 31 (0001 1111). On the other hand, the receive channel requires a 15-bit integer, the input 3968\n(000111110000000). Since the maximum digital value of receive channel is 16383 (01 111111111111 1), the\nmaximum low-tone signal is designed to be –12.32 dB below the full digital scale.\n20 log\n/C04663968\n16383/C04672\n/C0043–12.32dB\nIn the case of high-tone signal, the tone generator outputs a 7-bit integer with a maximum code of 39 (0100111).\nThe DTMF, therefore, pads a zero to the MSB and generates an 8-bit integer (00100111). In order to send thedigital code to receive channel, it is converted to a 15-bit integer with seven more zeros padded to LSB positionand biased as 4992 (001001110000000). Therefore, the maximum high-tone signal is designed to be –10.32dB\nbelow the full digital scale.\n20 log\n/C04664992\n16383/C04672\n/C0043–10.32dB\nIn the case of DTMF output, the tone generator outputs an 8-bit integer with the maximum code level of 70\n(01000110). This output is converted to a 15-bit code with the value of 8960 (010001100000000). Therefore,the maximum output of DTMF is designed to be –5.24 dB below the full digital scale.\n20 log/C04668960\n16383/C04672\n/C0043–5.24dB(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nTLV320AIC1110  \nSLAS359 – DECEMBER 2001\n30 www.ti.comPRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\nbuzzer logic section\nThe single-ended output BUZZCON is a PDM signal intended to drive a buzzer through an external driver\ntransistor.

Buzzer Driver System Architecture\nsupport section\nThe clock generator and control circuit use the master clock input (MCLK) to generate internal clocks to drive\ninternal counters, filters, and convertors. Register control data is written into and read back from the PCM codecregisters via the control interface.\nI\n2C-bus protocols\nThe PCM codec serial interface is designed to be I 2C bus-compatible and operates in the slave mode when CE\nis high. This interface consists of the following terminals:\nSCL: I 2C-bus serial clock. This input synchronizes the control data transfer to and from the codec.\nSDA: I 2C-bus serial address/data input/output. This is a bidirectional terminal that transfers register\ncontrol addresses and data into and out of the codec. It is an open drain terminal and thereforerequires a pullup resistor to V\nCC (typical 10 k Ω for 100 kHz).\nTLV320AIC1110 has a fixed device select address of (E2)HEX for write mode and (E3)HEX for read mode.For normal data transfer, SDA is allowed to change only when SCL is low. Changes when SCL is high are\nreserved for indicating the start and stop conditions.\nData transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy. During data transfer, the data line must remain\nstable whenever the clock line is at high. Changes in the data line while the clock line is at high are interpretedas a start or stop condition.\nTable 8. I\n2C-Bus Conditions\nCONDITION STATUS DESCRIPTION\nA Bus not busy Both data and clock lines remain at high.\nB Start data transferA high to low transition of the SDA line while the clock (SCL) is high determines a start condition.\nAll commands must proceed from a start condition.\nC Stop data transferA low to high transition of the SDA line while the clock (SCL) is high determines a stop condition.All operations must end with a stop condition.\nD Data validThe state of the data line represents valid data when, after a start condition, the data line is stablefor the duration of the high period of the clock signal.\nThe data on the line must be changed during the low period of the clock signal. There is one clock pulse per\nbit of data.\nTLV320AIC1110  \nSLAS359 – DECEMBER 2001\n31 www.ti.comPRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\nI2C-bus protocols (continued)\nEach data transfer is initiated with a start condition and terminated with a stop condition. The number of data\nbytes, transferred between the start and stop conditions, is determined by the master device (microprocessor).\nWhen addressed, the PCM codec generates an acknowledge after the reception of each byte. The master\ndevice must generate an extra clock pulse that is associated with this acknowledge bit.\nThe PCM codec must pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse so that the SDA line is at stable\nlow state during the high period of the acknowledge related clock pulse. Setup and hold times must be takeninto account. During read operations, the master device must signal an end of data to the slave by not generatingan acknowledge bit on the last byte that was clocked out of the slave. In this case, the slave (PCM codec) mustleave the data line high to enable the master device to generate the stop condition.\nclock frequencies and sample rates\nA fixed PCMSYN rate of 8 kHz determines the sampling rate.\nregister map addressing\nREGBITS\nREG07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00\nPower control 00Sidetone En TXEn RX TX En MICSEL BIASEn RXEnEAROUT\nSelPWRUP\nMode control 01Comp Sel TMEn PCMLB Comp En BUZZEn RXFLTR EnTXFLTR\nEnTXSLOPE En\nTXPGA 02 X TP3 TP2 TP1 TP0 ST2 ST1 ST0\nRXPGA 03 RP3 RP2 RP1 RP0 RV3 RV2 RV1 RV0\nHigh DTMF 04HIFREQ\nSel7HIFREQ\nSel6HIFREQ\nSel5HIFREQ\nSel4HIFREQ\nSel3HIFREQ\nSel2HIFREQ\nSel1HIFREQ Sel0\nLow DTMF 05LOFREQ\nSel7LOFREQ\nSel6LOFREQ\nSel5LOFREQ\nSel4LOFREQ\nSel3LOFREQ\nSel2LOFREQ\nSel1LOFREQ\nSel0\nAUX 06MCLK\nDetectRXPGA2†DTMFH1 DTMFH0 DTML1 DTMFL0 AMVX MCLK sel\n†For voice mode only\nregister power-up defaults\nREGBITS\nREG07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00\nPower control (1) †00 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0\nPower control (2) ‡00 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1\nMode control 01 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\nTXPGA 02 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRXPGA 03 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\nHigh DTMF 04 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nLow DTMF 05 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nAUX 06 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n†1.
