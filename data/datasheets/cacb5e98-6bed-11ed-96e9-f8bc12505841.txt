The ADM3485E  is designed for balanced data transmission and complies with TIA/EIA standards RS\xad485 and RS-422. The ADM3485E is a half-duplex transceiver that shares differential lines and has \nseparate enable inputs for the driver and the receiver.  \nThe devices have a 12 kΩ receiver input impedance, which \nallows up to 32 transceivers on a bus. Because only one driver should be enabled at any time, the output of a disabled or powered-down driver is tristated to avoid overloading the bus. \nThe receiver has a fail-safe feature that ensures a logic high \noutput when the inputs are floating. Excessive power dissipation \ncaused by bus contention or by output shorting is prevented \nwith a thermal shutdown circuit.  \nThe part is fully specified over the industrial temperature range \nand is available in an 8-lead narrow SOIC package. \n \nADM3485E   \n \nRev.

Contact discharge calls for a \ndirect connection to the unit being tested. Air -gap discharge \nuses a higher test voltage but does not make direct contact with \nthe unit under test. With air -gap discharge, the discharge gu n is \nmoved toward the unit under test, developing an arc across the \nair gap, hence the term air -gap discharge. This method is influenced by humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, distance, and rate of closure of  the discharge gun. The contact \ndischarg e method, while less realistic, is more repeatable and is \ngaining acceptance and preference over the air -gap method.  \nAlthough very little energy is contained within an ESD pulse, the extremely fast rise time, coupled with high voltages, can \ncause failures  in unprotected semiconductors. Catastrophic \ndestruction can occur immediately as a result of arcing or \nheating. Even if catastrophic failure does not occur immediately, the device can suffer from parametric degradation, which can \nresult in degraded performance. The cumulative effects of continuous exposure can eventually lead to complete failure.  \nI/O lines are particularly vulnerable to ESD damage. Simply \ntouching or plugging in an I/O cable can result in a static \ndischarge that can damage or completely destroy the interface product connected to the I/O port. It is extremely important, \ntherefore, to have high levels of ESD protection on the I/O lines.  \nThe ESD discharge could induce latch -up in the device under \ntest, so it is important that ESD testing on th e I/O pins be \ncarried out while device power is applied. This type of testing is \nmore representative of a real -world I/O discharge , where the \nequipment is operating normally when the discharge occurs.  \nTable 9.

D | Page 12 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nDIFFERENTIAL DATA TR ANSMISSION  \nDifferential data transmission is used to reliably transmit data  \nat high rates over long distances and through noisy environ -\nments. Differential transmission nullifies the effects of ground \nshifts and noise signals that appear as common- mode voltages \non the line.  \nTwo main standards that specify the electrical characteristics of \ntransceivers used in differential data transmission are approved \nby the Electroni cs Industries Association (EIA) . The RS -422 \nstandard specifies data rates up to 10 Mbps  and line lengths up \nto 4000 feet. A single driver can drive a transmission line with \nup to  10 receivers. The RS -485 standard was defined to cater to \ntrue multipoint communications. This standard meets or \nexceeds all the r equirements of RS -422 but also allows multiple \ndrivers and receivers to be connected to a single bus. An \nextended common- mode  range of −7 V to +12 V is defined.  \nThe most significant difference between RS -422 and RS -485 is \nthe fact that under the RS -485 standard  the drivers may be \ndisabled, thereby allowing more than one to be connected to a \nsingle line. Only one driver should be  enabled at a time, but the \nRS-485 standard contains additional specifications to guarantee \ndevice safety in the event of line contention.  \nCABLE AND DATA RATE \nThe transmission line of choice for RS -485 communications is a \ntwisted pair. Twisted -pair cable t ends to cancel common -mode \nnoise and also causes cancellation of the magnetic fields generated by the current flowing through each wire, thereby \nreducing the effective inductance of the pair.  The ADM3485E is designed for bidirectional data communi-\ncations  on multipoint transmission lines. A typical application \nshowing a multipoint transmission network is illustrated in Figure 25. Only one driver can transmit at a particular time,  but multiple receivers may be enabled simultaneousl y. \nAs with any transmission line, it is important that reflections are \nminimized. This can  be achieved by terminating the extreme \nends of the line using resistors equal to the characteristic impe -\ndance of the line. Stub lengths of f the main line must  also be \nkept as short as possible. A properly terminated transmission \nline appears purely resistive to the driver.  \nRECEIVER OPEN -CIRCUIT FAIL -SAFE  \nThe receiver input includes a fail -safe feature that guarantees  \na logic high on the receiver when the inputs are open circuit  \nor floating.  \nTable 10.
