The\nAD8628/AD8629/AD8630  are wide bandwidth auto-zero amplifiers\nfeaturing rail-to-rail input and output swing and low noise. Operation\nis fully specified from 2.7 V to 5 V single supply (±1.35 V to ±2.5 V\ndual supply).\nThe AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  provide benefits previously found on-\nly in expensive auto-zeroing or chopper-stabilized amplifiers. Using\nAnalog Devices, Inc., topology, these zero-drift amplifiers combine\nlow cost with high accuracy and low noise. No external capacitor is\nrequired. In addition, the AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  greatly reduce\nthe digital switching noise found in most chopper-stabilized amplifi-\ners.\nWith an offset voltage of only 1 µV, drift of less than 0.005 μV/°C,\nand noise of only 0.5 µV p-p (0.1 Hz to 10 Hz), the AD8628/\nAD8629/AD8630  are suited for applications where error sourcescannot be tolerated. Position and pressure sensors, medical equip-\nment, and strain gage amplifiers benefit greatly from nearly zero\ndrift over their operating temperature range. Many systems can\ntake advantage of the rail-to-rail input and output swings provided\nby the AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  to reduce input biasing complexity\nand maximize SNR.\nThe AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  are specified for the extended indus-\ntrial temperature range ( −40°C to +125°C). The AD8628 is available\nin tiny 5-lead TSOT, 5-lead SOT-23, and 8-lead narrow SOIC plastic\npackages . The AD8629 is available in the standard 8-lead narrow\nSOIC and MSOP plastic packages .

M | 14 of 21The AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  are single-supply, ultrahigh precision\nrail-to-rail input and output operational amplifiers. The typical offset\nvoltage of less than 1 µV allows these amplifiers to be easily\nconfigured for high gains without risk of excessive output voltage\nerrors. The extremely small temperature drift of 2 nV/°C ensures a\nminimum offset voltage error over their entire temperature range of\n−40°C to +125°C, making these amplifiers ideal for a variety of sen-\nsitive measurement applications in harsh operating environments.\nThe AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  achieve a high degree of precision\nthrough a patented combination of auto-zeroing and chopping. This\nunique topology allows the AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  to maintain\ntheir low offset voltage over a wide temperature range and over\ntheir operating lifetime. The AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  also optimize\nthe noise and bandwidth over previous generations of auto-zero\namplifiers, offering the lowest voltage noise of any auto-zero ampli-\nfier by more than 50%.\nPrevious designs used either auto-zeroing or chopping to add\nprecision to the specifications of an amplifier. Auto-zeroing results\nin low noise energy at the auto-zeroing frequency, at the expense\nof higher low frequency noise due to aliasing of wideband noise\ninto the auto-zeroed frequency band. Chopping results in lower\nlow frequency noise at the expense of larger noise energy at\nthe chopping frequency. The AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  family uses\nboth auto-zeroing and chopping in a patented ping-pong arrange-\nment to obtain lower low frequency noise together with lower\nenergy at the chopping and auto-zeroing frequencies, maximizing\nthe signal-to-noise ratio for the majority of applications without the\nneed for additional filtering. The relatively high clock frequency of\n15 kHz simplifies filter requirements for a wide, useful noise-free\nbandwidth.\nThe AD8628  is among the few auto-zero amplifiers offered in the\n5-lead TSOT package. This provides a significant improvement\nover the ac parameters of the previous auto-zero amplifiers. The\nAD8628/AD8629/AD8630  have low noise over a relatively wide\nbandwidth (0.1 Hz to 10 kHz) and can be used where the highest\ndc precision is required. In systems with signal bandwidths of from\n5 kHz to 10 kHz, the AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  provide true 16-bit\naccuracy, making them the best choice for very high resolution\nsystems.\n1/F NOISE\n1/f noise, also known as pink noise, is a major contributor to errors\nin dc-coupled measurements. This 1/f noise error term can be in\nthe range of several µV or more, and, when amplified with the\nclosed-loop gain of the circuit, can show up as a large output\noffset. For example, when an amplifier with a 5 µV p-p 1/f noise\nis configured for a gain of 1000, its output has 5 mV of error due\nto the 1/f noise. However, the AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  eliminate\n1/f noise internally, thereby greatly reducing output errors.\nThe internal elimination of 1/f noise is accomplished as follows.\n1/f noise appears as a slowly varying offset to the AD8628/AD8629/\nAD8630  inputs. Auto-zeroing corrects any dc or low frequencyoffset. Therefore, the 1/f noise component is essentially removed,\nleaving the AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  free of 1/f noise.\nOne advantage that the AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  bring to system\napplications over competitive auto-zero amplifiers is their very low\nnoise. The comparison shown in Figure 49  indicates an input-refer-\nred noise density of 19.4 nV/ √Hz at 1 kHz for the AD8628, which is\nmuch better than the Competitor A and Competitor B. The noise is\nflat from dc to 1.5 kHz, slowly increasing up to 20 kHz. The lower\nnoise at low frequency is desirable where auto-zero amplifiers are\nwidely used.\nFigure 49. Noise Spectral Density of AD8628 vs. Competition\nPEAK-TO-PEAK NOISE\nBecause of the ping-pong action between auto-zeroing and chop-\nping, the peak-to-peak noise of the AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  is\nmuch lower than the competition. Figure 50  and Figure 51  show\nthis comparison.\nFigure 50. AD8628 Peak-to-Peak Noise\nData Sheet AD8628/AD8629/AD8630\nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION\nanalog.com Rev. M | 15 of 21Figure 51. Competitor A Peak-to-Peak Noise\nNOISE BEHAVIOR WITH FIRST-ORDER, LOW-\nPASS FILTER\nThe AD8628 was simulated as a low-pass filter (see Figure 53 ) and\nthen configured as shown in Figure 52 . The behavior of the AD8628\nmatches the simulated data. It was verified that noise is rolled off\nby first-order filtering. Figure 53  and Figure 54  show the difference\nbetween the simulated and actual transfer functions of the circuit\nshown in Figure 52 .\nFigure 52. First-Order Low-Pass Filter Test Circuit, ×101 Gain and 3 kHz\nCorner Frequency\nFigure 53. Simulation Transfer Function of the Test Circuit in Figure 52Figure 54. Actual Transfer Function of the Test Circuit in Figure 52\nThe measured noise spectrum of the test circuit charted in Figure\n54 shows that noise between 5 kHz and 45 kHz is successfully\nrolled off by the first-order filter.\nTOTAL INTEGRATED INPUT-REFERRED NOISE\nFOR FIRST-ORDER FILTER\nFor a first-order filter, the total integrated noise from the AD8628 is\nlower than the noise of Competitor A.\nFigure 55. RMS Noise vs. 3 dB Filter Bandwidth in Hz\nINPUT OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION\nAlthough the AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  are rail-to-rail input amplifi-\ners, care should be taken to ensure that the potential difference\nbetween the inputs does not exceed the supply voltage. Under nor-\nmal negative feedback operating conditions, the amplifier corrects\nits output to ensure that the two inputs are at the same voltage.\nHowever, if either input exceeds either supply rail by more than 0.3\nV, large currents begin to flow through the ESD protection diodes in\nthe amplifier.\nThese diodes are connected between the inputs and each supply\nrail to protect the input transistors against an electrostatic discharge\nevent, and they are normally reverse-biased. However, if the input\nData Sheet AD8628/AD8629/AD8630\nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION\nanalog.com Rev. M | 16 of 21voltage exceeds the supply voltage, these ESD diodes can become\nforward-biased. Without current limiting, excessive amounts of cur-\nrent could flow through these diodes, causing permanent damage\nto the device. If inputs are subject to overvoltage, appropriate series\nresistors should be inserted to limit the diode current to less than 5\nmA maximum.\nOUTPUT PHASE REVERSAL\nOutput phase reversal occurs in some amplifiers when the input\ncommon-mode voltage range is exceeded. As common-mode volt-\nage is moved outside the common-mode range, the outputs of\nthese amplifiers can suddenly jump in the opposite direction to the\nsupply rail. This is the result of the differential input pair shutting\ndown, causing a radical shifting of internal voltages that results in\nthe erratic output behavior.\nThe AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  amplifiers have been carefully de-\nsigned to prevent any output phase reversal, provided that both\ninputs are maintained within the supply voltages. If one or both\ninputs could exceed either supply voltage, a resistor should be\nplaced in series with the input to limit the current to less than 5 mA.\nThis ensures that the output does not reverse its phase.\nOVERLOAD RECOVERY TIME\nMany auto-zero amplifiers are plagued by a long overload recovery\ntime, often in ms, due to the complicated settling behavior of the\ninternal nulling loops after saturation of the outputs. The AD8628/\nAD8629/AD8630  have been designed so that internal settling oc-\ncurs within two clock cycles after output saturation occurs. This\nresults in a much shorter recovery time, less than 10 µs, when\ncompared to other auto-zero amplifiers. The wide bandwidth of the\nAD8628/AD8629/AD8630  enhances performance when the parts\nare used to drive loads that inject transients into the outputs. This is\na common situation when an amplifier is used to drive the input of\nswitched capacitor ADCs.\nFigure 56. Positive Input Overload Recovery for the AD8628Figure 57.

The\nrelatively small output signal of the sensor demands high gain with\nvery low offset voltage and drift to avoid dc errors.\nIf interstage ac coupling is used, as in Figure 62 , low offset and\ndrift prevent the output of the input amplifier from drifting close\nto saturation. The low input bias currents generate minimal errors\nfrom the output impedance of the sensor. As with pressure sensors,the very low amplifier drift with time and temperature eliminate\nadditional errors once the temperature measurement is calibrated.\nThe low 1/f noise improves SNR for dc measurements taken over\nperiods often exceeding one-fifth of a second.\nFigure 62  shows a circuit that can amplify ac signals from 100 µV\nto 300 µV up to the 1 V to 3 V levels, with a gain of 10,000 for\naccurate analog-to-digital conversion.\nFigure 62. AD8629 Used as Preamplifier for Thermopile\nPRECISION CURRENT SHUNT SENSOR\nA precision current shunt sensor benefits from the unique attributes\nof auto-zero amplifiers when used in a differencing configuration, as\nshown in Figure 63 . Current shunt sensors are used in precision\ncurrent sources for feedback control systems. They are also used in\na variety of other applications, including battery fuel gauging, laser\ndiode power measurement and control, torque feedback controls in\nelectric power steering, and precision power metering.\nFigure 63. Low-Side Current Sensing\nIn such applications, it is desirable to use a shunt with very low re-\nsistance to minimize the series voltage drop; this minimizes wasted\npower and allows the measurement of high currents while saving\npower. A typical shunt might be 0.1 Ω. At measured current values\nof 1 A, the output signal of the shunt is hundreds of millivolts, or\neven volts, and amplifier error sources are not critical. However,\nat low measured current values in the 1 mA range, the 100 µV\noutput voltage of the shunt demands a very low offset voltage and\ndrift to maintain absolute accuracy. Low input bias currents are also\nneeded, so that injected bias current does not become a significant\npercentage of the measured current. High open-loop gain, CMRR,\nData Sheet AD8628/AD8629/AD8630\nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION\nanalog.com Rev. M | 18 of 21and PSRR help to maintain the overall circuit accuracy. As long\nas the rate of change of the current is not too fast, an auto-zero\namplifier can be used with excellent results.\nOUTPUT AMPLIFIER FOR HIGH PRECISION\nDACS\nThe AD8628/AD8629/AD8630  are used as output amplifiers for a\n16-bit high precision DAC in a unipolar configuration. In this case,\nthe selected op amp needs to have a very low offset voltage (the\nDAC LSB is 38 µV when operated with a 2.5 V reference) to\neliminate the need for output offset trims. The input bias current\n(typically a few tens of picoamperes) must also be very low be-\ncause it generates an additional zero code error when multiplied by\nthe DAC output impedance (approximately 6 k Ω).\nRail-to-rail input and output provide full-scale output with very little\nerror. The output impedance of the DAC is constant and code\nindependent, but the high input impedance of the AD8628/AD8629/\nAD8630  minimizes gain errors. The wide bandwidth of the amplifi-ers also serves well in this case. The amplifiers, with settling time\nof 1 µs, add another time constant to the system, increasing the\nsettling time of the output. The settling time of the AD5541  is 1 µs.\nThe combined settling time is approximately 1.4 µs, as can be\nderived from the following equation:\nt S T OT A L = t S D A C2+ t S AD86282(1)\nFigure 64.
