Included \nin the package are the switching controller , power FETs, \ninductors and all supporting components. Operating from \nan input voltage range of 4.5V to 16V, the LTM4620A \nsupports two outputs each with an output voltage range of 0.6V to 5.3V, set by a single external resistor . Its high efficiency design delivers up to 13A continuous current for each output. Only a few input and output capacitors are needed.\nThe device supports frequency synchronization, mul -\ntiphase operation, Burst Mode® operation and output \nvoltage tracking for supply rail sequencing and has an \nonboard temperature diode for device temperature mon -\nitoring. High switching frequency and a current mode \narchitecture enable a very fast transient response to line and load changes without sacrificing stability. \nFault protection features include overvoltage and over -\ncurrent protection. The power module is offered in a proprietary space saving and thermally enhanced 15mm × 15mm × 4.41mm LGA package and 15mm  \n× 15mm × 5.01mm BGA package. The LTM4620A is  \navailable with SnPb (BGA) or RoHS compliant terminal \nfinish.\n26A, 5V Output DC/DC µModule® RegulatorFEATURES\nAPPLICATIONSn Dual 13A or Single 26A Output\nn Wide Input Voltage Range: 4.5V to 16V\nn Output Voltage Range: 0.6V to 5.3V\nn ±1.5% Maximum Total DC Output Error \nn Multiphase Current Sharing with Multiple \nLTM4620As Up to 100A\nn Higher Efficiency  and Wider V OUT Range Than LTM4620\nn Differential Remote Sense Amplifier\nn Current Mode Control/Fast T ransient Response\nn Adjustable Switching Frequency\nn Overcurrent Foldback Protection\nn Frequency Synchronization\nn Internal Temperature Monitor\nn Output Overvoltage Protection\nn Pin Compatible with the LTM4628 (Dual 8A) and LTM4620 (Dual 13A)\nn Thermally Enhanced (15mm × 15mm × 4.41mm) LGA Package and (15mm \n× 15mm × 5.01mm) BGA \nPackage\nn Telecom and Networking Equipment\nn Industrial Equipment\n5V Efficiency vs I OUT\nTOTAL OUTPUT CURRENT (A)180EFFICIENCY (%)\n859095100\n3 5 8 10\n4620A TA01b12 14 19 21 16 238V TO 5V EFF (650kHz)\n12V TO 5V EFF (750kHz)\n4620A TA01aL TM4620AVIN\nTEMP\nRUN1\nRUN2\nTRACK1\nTRACK2f\nSET8.25k5k\n100µF\n6.3V×2\n100µF6.3V×2PHASMDV\nOUT1\nVOUTS1\nSW1\nVFB1\nVFB2\nCOMP1\nCOMP2\nVOUTS2\nVOUT2VOUT\n5V\n26ASW2\nPGOOD2\nPGOODMODE_PLLIN CLKOUT INTV CC EXTV CCPGOOD1PGOOD\nSGND GND DIFFP DIFFNDIFFOUT10k*\n5.1V*120k\n0.1µF22µF25V×44.7µFINTV CC\n220pFINTV CC\nVOUT\n* PULL-UP RESISTOR AND  ZENER ARE OPTIONALV\nIN\n7V TO 16V\nINTV CCL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology, the Linear logo, µModule, Burst Mode, L TpowerCAD and PolyPhase are registered trademarks of Analog Devices, Inc.

It can provide two \n13A outputs with few external input and output capacitors \nand setup components. This module provides precisely \nregulated output voltages programmable via external \nresistors from 0.6V DC to 5.3V DC over 4.5V to 16V input \nvoltages. The typical application schematic is shown in \nFigure 26. See Note 8 in the Electrical Characteristics sec -\ntion for output current guideline.\nThe LTM4620A has dual integrated constant-frequency \ncurrent mode regulators and built-in power MOSFET \ndevices with fast switching speed. The typical switching \nfrequency is 500kHz. For switching-noise sensitive appli -\ncations, it can be externally synchronized from 400kHz to \n780kHz. A resistor can be used to program a free run fre -\nquency on the f SET pin. See the Applications Information \nsection.\nWith current mode control and internal feedback loop \ncompensation, the LTM4620A module has sufficient sta -\nbility margins and good transient performance with a wide \nrange of output capacitors, even with all ceramic output capacitors.\nCurrent mode control provides cycle-by-cycle fast current \nlimit and foldback current limit in an overcurrent condi-tion. Internal overvoltage and undervoltage comparators \npull the open-drain PGOOD outputs low if the output \nfeedback voltage exits a ±10% window around the regu-\nlation point. As the output voltage exceeds 10% above \nregulation, the bottom MOSFET will turn on to clamp the output voltage. The top MOSFET will be turned off. This overvoltage protect is feedback voltage referred.\nPulling the RUN pins below 1.1V forces the regulators \ninto a shutdown state, by turning off both MOSFETs. The TRACK pins are used for programming the output \nvoltage ramp and voltage tracking during start-up or \nused for soft-starting the regulator . See the Applications Information section.\nThe LTM4620A is internally compensated to be stable over all operating conditions. Table 5 provides a guide line for input and output capacitances for several oper -\nating conditions. L TpowerCAD® is available for transient \nand stability analysis. The V FB pin is used to program the \noutput voltage with a single external resistor to ground. \nA differential remote sense amplifier is available for sens -\ning the output voltage accurately on one of the outputs at the load point, or in parallel operation sensing the output voltage at the load point. \nMultiphase operation can be easily employed with the \nMODE_PLLIN, PHASMD, and CLKOUT pins. Up to 12 phases can be cascaded to run simultaneously with \nrespect to each other by programming the PHMODE pin to \ndifferent levels. See the Applications Information section.\nHigh efficiency at light loads can be accomplished with \nselectable Burst Mode operation or pulse-skipping opera-\ntion using the MODE pin. These light load features will \naccommodate battery operation. Efficiency graphs are pro -\nvided for light load operation in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics  section. See the Applications Information \nsection for details. \nA TEMP pin is provided to allow the internal device tem -\nperature to be monitored using an onboard diode con -\nnected PNP transistor . This diode connected PNP transis -\ntor is grounded in the module and can be used as a gen -\neral temperature monitor using a device that is designed \nto monitor the single-ended connection.  \nLTM4620A12\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620AThe typical LTM4620A application circuit is shown in  \nFigure 26. External component selection is primarily \ndetermined by the maximum load current and output  \nvoltage. Refer to Table 5 for specific external capacitor \nrequirements for particular applications.\nVIN to V OUT Step-Down Ratios\nThere are restrictions in the maximum V IN and V OUT step-\ndown ratio that can be achieved for a given input voltage. \nEach output of the LTM4620A is capable of 95% duty \ncycle at 500kHz, but the V IN to V OUT minimum drop -\nout is still shown as a function of its load current and \nwill limit output current capability related to high duty \ncycle on the top side switch. Minimum on-time t ON(MIN)  \nis another consideration in operating at a specified duty \ncycle while operating at a certain frequency due to the \nfact that t ON(MIN)  < D/f SW, where D is duty cycle and f SW \nis the switching frequency. t ON(MIN)  is specified in the \nelectrical parameters as 90ns. See Note 8 in the Electrical \nCharacteristics section for output current guideline.\nOutput Voltage Programming\nThe PWM controller has an internal 0.6V reference volt -\nage. As shown in the Block Diagram, a 60.4kΩ internal \nfeedback resistor connects between the V OUTS1  to V FB1 \nand V OUTS2  to V FB2. It is very important that these pins \nbe connected to their respective outputs for proper feed -\nback regulation. Overvoltage can occur if these V OUTS1  \nand V OUTS2  pins are left floating when used as individual \nregulators, or at least one of them is used in paralleled \nregulators. The output voltage will default to 0.6V with no \nfeedback resistor on either V FB1 or V FB2. Adding a resistor \nRFB from V FB pin to GND programs the output voltage:\n  VOUT=0.6V •60.4k +RFB\nRFB\nTable 1. V FB Resistor Table vs Various Output Voltages\nVOUT 0.6V 1.0V 1.2V 1.5V 1.8V 2.5V 3.3V 5V\nRFB Open 90.9k 60.4k 40.2k 30.2k 19.1k 13.3k 8.25k\nFor parallel operation of multiple channels the same feed -\nback setting resistor can be used for the parallel design. This is done by connecting the V\nOUTS1  to the output as \nshown in Figure 2, thus tying one of the internal 60.4k APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nresistors to the output.  All of the V FB pins tie together with \none programming resistor as shown in Figure 2. \nIn parallel operation, the V FB pins have an I FB current of 20nA  \nmaximum each channel. To reduce output voltage error due \nto this current, an additional V OUTS pin can be tied to V OUT, \nand an additional R FB resistor can be used to lower the total \nThevenin equivalent resistance seen by this current. For \nexample in Figure 2, the total Thevenin equivalent resistance \nof the V FB pin is (60.4k //RFB), which is 30.2k where R FB is \nequal to 60.4k for a 1.2V output. Four phases connected \nin parallel equates to a worse case feedback current of  \n4 • IFB = 80nA maximum. The voltage error is 80nA • 30.2k  \n= 2.4mV. If V OUTS2  is connected, as shown in Figure 2, to \nVOUT, and another 60.4k resistor is connected from V FB2 \nto ground, then the voltage error is reduced to 1.2mV. If the voltage error is acceptable then no additional connec -\ntions are necessary. The onboard 60.4k resistor is 0.5% \naccurate and the V FB resistor can be chosen by the user to \nbe as accurate as needed. All COMP pins are tied together for current sharing between the phases. The TRACK pins \ncan be tied together and a single soft-start capacitor can be \nused to soft-start the regulator . The soft-start equation will need to have the soft-start current parameter increased by the number of paralleled channels. See TRACK/Soft-Start \nPin section.\nFigure 2. 4-Phase Parallel Configurations4620A F0260.4kTRACK1\nTRACK2VOUT1\nVOUTS1\nVFB1\nVFB2COMP14 PARALLELED OUTPUTS \nFOR 1.2V AT 50A\nOPTIONAL CONNECTIONCOMP2\nVOUTS2VOUT2\n60.4k\n60.4kTRACK1\nTRACK2 0.1µFVOUT1\nVOUTS1\nVFB1\nVFB2COMP1\nCOMP2\nVOUTS2VOUT2\n60.4kL TM4620AL TM4620A\nRFB\n60.4kOPTIONAL\nRFB\n60.4k\nUSE TO LOWERTOTAL EQUIVALENTRESISTANCE TO LOWERI\nFB VOL TAGE ERROR\nLTM4620A13\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620AAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInput Capacitors\nThe LTM4620A module should be connected to a low \nAC-impedance DC source. For the regulator input four \n22µF input ceramic capacitors are used for RMS ripple \ncurrent.  A 47µF to 100µF surface mount aluminum elec-\ntrolytic bulk capacitor can be used for more input bulk \ncapacitance.  This bulk input capacitor is only needed \nif the input source impedance is compromised by long \ninductive leads, traces or not enough source capacitance. \nIf low impedance power planes are used, then this bulk capacitor is not needed.\nFor a buck converter , the switching duty-cycle can be \nestimated as:\n  D=VOUT\nVIN\nWithout considering the inductor current ripple, for each \noutput, the RMS current of the input capacitor can be \nestimated as:\n  ICIN(RMS) =IOUT(MAX)\nη%• D • 1 −D( )\nIn the above equation, η% is the estimated efficiency of the power module. The bulk capacitor can be a switcher-rated electrolytic aluminum capacitor , Polymer capacitor . Output Capacitors\nThe LTM4620A is designed for low output voltage rip -\nple noise and good transient response. The bulk output capacitors defined as C\nOUT are chosen with low enough \neffective series resistance (ESR) to meet the output volt -\nage ripple and transient requirements. C OUT can be a low \nESR tantalum capacitor , the low ESR polymer capacitor \nor ceramic capacitor . The typical output capacitance range \nfor each output is from 200µF to 470µF. Additional output \nfiltering may be required by the system designer , if further \nreduction of output ripples or dynamic transient spikes \nis required. Table 5 shows a matrix of different output \nvoltages and output capacitors to minimize the voltage \ndroop and overshoot during a 7A/µs transient. The table optimizes total equivalent ESR and total bulk capacitance \nto optimize the transient performance. Stability criteria \nare considered in the Table 5 matrix, and the L TpowerCAD \nwill be provided for stability analysis. Multiphase opera -\ntion will reduce effective output ripple as a function of the \nnumber of phases. Application Note 77 discusses this \nnoise reduction versus output ripple current cancellation, \nbut the output capacitance should be considered care -\nfully as a function of stability and transient response. The L TpowerCAD can calculate the output ripple reduction as \nthe number of implemented phases increases by N times. \nA small value 10Ω to 50Ω resistor can be place in series \nfrom V OUT to the V OUTS pin to allow for a bode plot ana -\nlyzer to inject a signal into the control loop and validate the regulator stability . The \nsame resistor could be place \nin series from V OUT to DIFFP and a bode plot analyzer \ncould inject a signal into the control loop and validate the regulator stability.\nLTM4620A14\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620AAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nBurst Mode Operation\nThe LTM4620A is capable of Burst Mode operation on \neach regulator in which the power MOSFETs operate inter -\nmittently based on load demand, thus saving quiescent \ncurrent. For applications where maximizing the efficiency \nat very light loads is a high priority, Burst Mode operation \nshould be applied. Burst Mode operation is enabled with \nthe MODE/PLLIN pin floating. During this operation, the peak current of the inductor is set to approximately one \nthird of the maximum peak current value in normal opera -\ntion even though the voltage at the COMP pin indicates a lower value. The voltage at the COMP pin drops when \nthe inductor’ s average current is greater than the load \nrequirement. As the COMP voltage drops below 0.5V, the BURST comparator trips, causing the internal sleep line to go high and turn off both power MOSFETs. \nIn sleep mode, the internal circuitry is partially turned off, \nreducing the quiescent current to about 450µA for each output. The load current is now being supplied from the output capacitors. When the output voltage drops, caus -\ning COMP to rise above 0.5V, the internal sleep line goes low, and the \nLTM4620A resumes normal operation. The \nnext oscillator cycle will turn on the top power MOSFET and the switching cycle repeats. Either regulator can be configured for Burst Mode operation.\nPulse-Skipping Mode Operation\nIn applications where low output ripple and high efficiency \nat intermediate currents are desired, pulse-skipping \nmode should be used. Pulse-skipping operation allows \nthe LTM4620A to skip cycles at low output loads, thus \nincreasing efficiency by reducing switching loss. Tying \nthe MODE/PLLIN pin to INTV CC enables pulse-skipping \noperation. At light loads the internal current compara -\ntor may remain tripped for several cycles and force the \ntop MOSFET to stay off for several cycles, thus skipping \ncycles. The inductor current does not reverse in this \nmode. This mode will maintain higher effective frequen -\ncies thus lower output ripple and lower noise than Burst \nMode operation. Either regulator can be configured for \npulse-skipping mode.Forced Continuous Operation\nIn applications where fixed frequency operation is more \ncritical than low current efficiency, and where the low -\nest output ripple is desired, forced continuous opera -\ntion should be used. Forced continuous operation can \nbe enabled by tying the MODE/PLLIN pin to GND. In this \nmode, inductor current is allowed to reverse during low \noutput loads, the COMP voltage is in control of the current \ncomparator threshold throughout, and the top MOSFET always turns on with each oscillator pulse. During start-\nup, forced continuous mode is disabled and inductor cur -\nrent is prevented from reversing until the LTM4620A’s \noutput voltage is in regulation. Either regulator can be \nconfigured for force continuous mode.\nMultiphase Operation\nFor output loads that demand more than 13A of current, \ntwo outputs in LTM4620A or even multiple LTM4620As \ncan be paralleled to run out of phase to provide more \noutput current without increasing input and output volt-age ripples. The MODE/PLLIN pin allows the LTM4620A \nto synchronize to \nan external clock (between 400kHz and \n780kHz) and the internal phase-locked-loop allows the \nLTM4620A to lock onto an incoming clock phase as well. \nThe CLKOUT signal can be connected to the MODE/PLLIN \npin of the following stage to line up both the frequency and the phase of the entire system. Tying the PHMODE \npin to INTV CC, SGND, or (floating) generates a phase \ndifference (between MODE/PLLIN and CLKOUT) of 120 \ndegrees, 60 degrees, or 90 degrees respectively. A total of 12 phases can be cascaded to run simultaneously with respect to each other by programming the PHMODE pin of each LTM4620A channel to different levels. Figure 3 shows a 2-phase design, 4-phase design and a 6-phase \ndesign example for clock phasing with the PHASMD table.\nA multiphase power supply significantly reduces the amount of ripple current in both the input and output \ncapacitors. The RMS input ripple current is reduced by, \nand the effective ripple frequency is multiplied by, the \nnumber of phases used (assuming that the input voltage 22\nLTM4620A15\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620Ais greater than the number of phases used times the out -\nput voltage). The output ripple amplitude is also reduced \nby the number of phases used when all of the outputs \nare tied together to achieve a single high output current \ndesign.Figure 3.

Frequency Selection and Phase-Lock Loop  (MODE/PLLIN and f\nSET Pins)\nThe LTM4620A device is operated over a range of fre -\nquencies to improve power conversion efficiency. It is rec -\nommended to operate the lower output voltages or lower duty cycle conversions at lower frequencies to improve efficiency by lowering power MOSFET switching losses. Higher output voltages or higher duty cycle conversions \ncan be operated at higher frequencies to limit inductor \nripple current. The efficiency graphs will show an operat -\ning frequency chosen for that condition. Select frequency \nin reference to the highest output voltage.\nLTM4620A17\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620AAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 5. Operating Frequency vs f SET Pin Voltage \nThe LTM4620A switching frequency can be set with an exter -\nnal resistor from the f SET pin to SGND. An accurate 10µA \ncurrent source into the resistor will set a voltage that pro -\ngrams the frequency or a DC voltage can be applied. Figure 5  \nshows a graph of frequency setting verses programming \nvoltage. An external clock can be applied to the MODE/PLLIN pin from 0V to INTV\nCC over a frequency range of \n400kHz to 780kHz. The clock input high threshold is 1.6V \nand the clock input low threshold is 1V. The LTM4620A \nhas the PLL loop filter components on board. The fre -\nquency setting resistor should always be present to set the initial switching frequency before locking to an exter -\nnal clock.  Both regulators will operate in continuous \nmode while being externally clock. \nThe output of the PLL phase detector has a pair of com -\nplementary current sources that charge and discharge \nthe internal filter network. When the external clock is \napplied then the f SET frequency resistor is disconnected \nwith an internal switch, and the current sources control \nthe frequency adjustment to lock to the incoming external \nclock. When no external clock is applied, then the internal \nswitch is on, thus connecting the external f SET frequency \nset resistor for free run operation.Minimum On-TimeMinimum on-time t\nON is the smallest time duration that \nthe LTM4620A is capable of turning on the top MOSFET on \neither channel. It is determined by internal timing delays, \nand the gate charge required turning on the top MOSFET . Low duty cycle applications may approach this minimum on-time limit and care should be taken to ensure that:\n  VOUT\nVIN•FREQ>tON(MIN)\nIf the duty cycle falls below what can be accommodated by the minimum on-time, the controller will begin to skip cycles. The output voltage will continue to be regulated, \nbut the output ripple will increase. The on-time can be \nincreased by lowering the switching frequency. A good \nrule of thumb is to keep on-time longer than 110ns.\nOutput Voltage T racking \nOutput voltage tracking can be programmed externally \nusing the TRACK pins. The output can be tracked up and \ndown with another regulator . The master regulator’s out -\nput is divided down with an external resistor divider that is the same as the slave regulator ’ \ns feedback divider to \nimplement coincident tracking. The LTM4620A uses an \naccurate 60.4k resistor internally for the top feedback \nresistor for each channel. Figure 6 shows an example of coincident tracking.

A 1.3µA current \nsource will charge the TRACK pin up to the reference volt -\nage and then proceed up to INTV CC. After the 0.6V ramp, \nthe TRACK pin will no longer be in control, and the internal \nvoltage reference will control output regulation from the \nfeedback divider . Foldback current limit is disabled during \nthis sequence of turn-on during tracking or soft-starting. \nThe TRACK pins are pulled low when the RUN pin is below \n1.2V. The total soft-start time can be calculated as:\n  tSOFT-START =CSS\n1.3µA\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7• 0.6\nRegardless of the mode selected by the MODE/PLLIN \npin, the regulator channels will always start in pulse-\nskipping mode up to TRACK = 0.5V. Between TRACK = \n0.5V and 0.54V, it will operate in forced continuous mode \nand revert to the selected mode once TRACK > 0.54V. In order to track with another channel once in steady state \noperation, the LTM4620A is forced into continuous mode \noperation as soon as V FB is below 0.54V regardless of the \nsetting on the MODE/PLLIN pin.  \nRatiometric tracking can be achieved by a few simple cal -\nculations and the slew rate value applied to the master’s \nTRACK pin. As mentioned above, the TRACK pin has a \ncontrol range from 0 to 0.6V. The master’ s TRACK pin \nslew rate is directly equal to the master’ s output slew rate \nin Volts/Time. The equation: \n  MR\nSR• 60.4k =RTB\nwhere MR is the master’s output slew rate and SR is the slave’s output slew rate in Volts/Time. When coincident tracking is desired, then MR and SR are equal, thus R\nTB \nis equal the 60.4k. R TA is derived from equation:\n  RTA=0.6V\nVFB\n60.4k+VFB\nRFB−VTRACK\nRTB\nwhere V FB is the feedback voltage reference of the regula -\ntor , and V TRACK  is 0.6V. Since R TB is equal to the 60.4k \ntop feedback resistor of the slave regulator in equal slew rate or coincident tracking, then R TA is equal to R FB with \nVFB = V TRACK . Therefore R TB = 60.4k, and R TA = 60.4k in \nFigure 6.\nIn ratiometric tracking, a different slew rate maybe desired \nfor the slave regulator . R TB can be solved for when SR is \nslower than MR. Make sure that the slave supply slew \nrate is chosen to be fast enough so that the slave output voltage will reach it final value before the master output.\nFor example, MR = 1.5V/1ms, and SR = 1.2V/1ms. Then \nR\nTB = 76.8k. Solve for R TA to equal to 49.9k.\nEach of the TRACK pins will have the 1.3µA current source \non when a resistive divider is used to implement tracking on that specific channel. This will impose an offset on the TRACK pin input. Smaller values resistors with the same \nratios as the resistor values calculated from the above \nequation can be used. For example, where the 60.4k is \nused then a 6.04k can be used to reduce the TRACK pin offset to a negligible value.\nPower Good\nThe PGOOD pins are open drain pins that can be used to \nmonitor valid output voltage regulation. This pin monitors \na ±10% window around the regulation point. A resistor \ncan be pulled up to a particular supply voltage no greater than 6V maximum for monitoring.\nStability Compensation\nThe module has already been internally compensated for \nall output voltages. Table 5 is provided for most applica -\ntion requirements. The L TpowerCAD will be provided for other control loop optimization. \nRun Enable\nThe RUN pins have an enable threshold of 1.4V maximum, \ntypically 1.25V with 150mV of hysteresis. They control the \nturn on each of the channels and INTV CC. These pins can be \npulled up to V IN for 5V operation, or a 5V Zener diode can be \nplaced on the pins and a 10k to 100k resistor can be placed \nup to higher than 5V  input for enabling the channels. The \nRUN pins can also be used for output voltage sequencing.  \nIn parallel operation the RUN pins can be tie together \nLTM4620A20\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620AAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nand controlled from a single control. See the Typical \nApplication circuits in Figure 26.\nINTV CC and EXTV CC\nThe LTM4620A module has an internal 5V low dropout \nregulator that is derived from the input voltage. This regu-\nlator is used to power the control circuitry and the power \nMOSFET drivers. This regulator can source up to 70mA, and typically uses ~30mA for powering the device at the maximum frequency. This internal 5V supply is enabled by either RUN1 or RUN2.\nEXTV CC allows an external 5V supply to power the  \nLTM4620A and reduce power dissipation from the inter -\nnal low dropout 5V regulator . The power loss savings can be calculated by :\n (VIN – 5V) • 30mA = PLOSS\nEXTV CC has a threshold of 4.7V for activation, and a maxi -\nmum rating of 6V. When using a 5V input, connect this 5V input to EXTV\nCC also to maintain a 5V gate drive level. \nEXTV CC must sequence on after V IN, and EXTV CC must \nsequence off before V IN. When designing a 5V  output, \nconnect this 5V output to EXTV CC. Use an external 5V bias \non EXTV CC to improve efficiency.\nDifferential Remote Sense Amplifier\nAn accurate differential remote sense amplifier is provided \nto sense low output voltages accurately at the remote \nload points. This is especially true for high current loads. The amplifier can be used on one of the two channels, or on a single parallel output. It is very important that the DIFFP and DIFFN are connected properly at the output, \nand DIFFOUT is connected to either V OUTS1  or V OUTS2 . \nIn parallel operation, the DIFFP and DIFFN are connected \nproperly at the output, and DIFFOUT is connected to \none of the V OUTS pins. Review the parallel schematics in  \nFigure 29 and review Figure 2. The diffamp can only be used for output voltage ≤3.3V.\nSW Pins\nThe SW pins are generally for testing purposes by moni -\ntoring these pins. These pins can also be used to dampen \nout switch node ringing caused by LC parasitic in the switched current paths. Usually a series R-C combination \nis used called a snubber circuit. The resistor will dampen \nthe resonance and the capacitor is chosen to only affect the high frequency ringing across the resistor . If the stray inductance or capacitance can be measured or approxi -\nmated then a somewhat analytical technique can be used \nto select the snubber values. The inductance is usually \neasier to predict. It combines the power path board induc -\ntance in combination with the MOSFET interconnect bond \nwire inductance. \nFirst the SW pin can be monitored with a wide bandwidth \nscope with a high frequency scope probe. The ring fre -\nquency can be measured for its value. The impedance Z \ncan be calculated:\n Z(L) = 2πfL,\nwhere f is the resonant frequency of the ring, and L is the \ntotal parasitic inductance in the switch path. If a resistor is selected that is equal to Z, then the ringing should be \ndampened. The snubber capacitor value is chosen so that \nits impedance is equal to the resistor at the ring frequency. \nCalculated by: Z(C) = 1/(2πfC). These values are a good \nplace to start with. Modification to these components \nshould be made to attenuate the ringing with the least \namount of power loss. \nTemperature Monitoring (TEMP)\nA diode connected PNP transistor is used for the TEMP \nmonitor function by monitoring its voltage over tempera -\nture. The temperature dependence of this diode can be understood in the equation :\n D=nVTInID\nIS\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8f6\uf8f8,\n  \nWhere V T is the thermal voltage (kT/q), and n, the ideality \nfactor is 1 for the two diode connected PNPs being used \nin the LTM4620. Since I D has an exponential tempera -\nture dependence that can be understood from the typical \nempirical equation for I S:  \n IS = I0 exp (–VG0/VT) ,\nWhere I o is some process and geometry dependent current \n(Io is typically around 20 orders of magnitude larger than \nIS at room temperature, so I o is much larger than typical \nLTM4620A21\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620AAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nvalues of I D), and VG0 is the band gap voltage of 1.2V \nextrapolated to absolute zero of –273°C Kelvin. Figure 8  \nshows a plot of the diode temperature characteristic of \nthe diode connected PNP transistor biased with a 100µA \ncurrent sour\nce. This plot would extend to the left back to \n1.2V at –273°C Kelvin. This curve is stop at –55°C due to the test system limits.\nIf we take the I S equation and substitute into the V D equa -\ntion, then we get:\n VD=VG0 –Kt\nq\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8f6\uf8f8lnI0\nID\n\uf8ed\uf8f8, VT=kT\nq\uf8eb\uf8ed\uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8f8\nThe expression shows that the junction voltage of the PNP \nconnected diode decreases linearly if I o were constant \nfrom a value VG0 of 1.2V at absolute zero to a decreasing \nvalue with increased temperature.\nIf we take this equation and differentiate it with respect to \ntemperature T , then:\n  dVD\ndT=– VG0 – VD( ) / T\n    This\n    dVD\ndT\nchange as a function of temperature is the typical \n~–2mV/°C. This equation is simplified for the first order derivation.\nSolving for T , T = – (VG0 –  VD)/ dVD provide the \ntemperature. \n1st Example: Figure 4 for 27°C, or 300°C Kelvin the diode \nvoltage is 0.598V, thus, 300°C = –(1200mV – 598mV)/  \n–2mV/°C)\n2nd Example:  Figure 4 for 75°C , or 350°C  Kelvin the diode \nvoltage is 0.50V, thus, 350°C = –( 1200mV – 500mV)/ \n–2mV/°C)\nConverting the Kelvin scale to Celsius is simply taking the \nKelvin temp and subtracting –273°C Kelvin from it.\nA typical forward voltage is measured and placed in the \nelectrical characteristics section of the data sheet, and \nFigure 8 is the plot of this forward voltage. Measure this \nforward voltage at 27°C  to establish a reference point. \nThen use the above expression while measuring the Figure 8. Diode Voltage V D vs Temperature \nT(°C) for Different Bias Currents\nforward voltage over temperature will provide a general \ntemperature monitor .\nThe diode connected PNP transistor can be pulled up to \nVIN with a resistor to set the current to 100µA for using \nthis diode connected transistor as a general temperature monitor by monitoring the diode voltage drop with tem -\nperature. See Figure 27 for an example.\nThermal Considerations and Output Current Derating\nThe thermal resistances reported in the Pin Configuration \nsection of the data sheet are consistent with those param-\neters defined by JESD 51-9 and are intended for use with \nfinite element analysis (FEA) software modeling tools that \nleverage the outcome of thermal modeling, simulation, \nand correlation to hardware evaluation performed on a \nµModule package mounted to a hardware test board—\nalso defined by JESD 51-9 (“Test Boards for Area Array \nSurface Mount Package Thermal Measurements” ). The \nmotivation for providing these thermal coefficients in \nfound in JESD 51-12 (“ Guidelines for Reporting and Using \nElectronic Package Thermal Information”).\nMany designers may opt to use laboratory equipment and \na test vehicle such as the demo board to anticipate the \nµModule regulator’s thermal performance in their appli-cation at various electrical and environmental operating TEMPERATURE (°C)–50 –250.3TEMP PIN DIODE VOLTAGE (V)0.50.8\n0 50 750.40.7\n0.6\n25 100\n4620A F08125ID = 100µA\nLTM4620A22\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620Aconditions to compliment any FEA activities. Without \nFEA software, the thermal resistances reported in the \nPin Configuration section are in-and-of themselves not \nrelevant to providing guidance of thermal performance; \ninstead, the derating curves provided in the data sheet can \nbe used in a manner that yields insight and guidance per -\ntaining to one’s application-usage, and can be adapted to correlate thermal per formance to one’s own application.\nThe Pin Configuration section typically gives four thermal \ncoefficients explicitly defined in JESD 51-12; these coef-ficients are quoted or paraphrased below:\n1.\n θJA, the thermal resistance from junction to ambient, \nis the natural convection junction-to-ambient air ther -\nmal resistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed \nenclosure. This environment is sometimes referred to \nas “still air” although natural convection causes the \nair to move.  This value is determined with the part \nmounted to a JESD 51-9 defined test board, which \ndoes not reflect an actual application or viable operat -\ning condition.\n2. θJCbottom , the thermal resistance from junction to the \nbottom of the product case, is the junction-to-board thermal resistance with all of the component power dissipation flowing through the bottom of the pack -\nage. In the typical µModule, the bulk of the heat flows \nout the bottom of the package, but there is always \nheat flow out into the ambient environment. As a \nresult, this thermal resistance value may be useful \nfor comparing packages but the test conditions don’t generally match the user’s application.\n3.\n θJCtop, the thermal resistance from junction to top of \nthe product case, is determined with nearly all of the \ncomponent power dissipation flowing through the top APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nof the package. As the electrical connections of the typical µModule are on the bottom of the package, it is rare for an application to operate such that most of \nthe heat flows from the junction to the top of the part.  \nAs in the case of θJCbottom , this value may be useful \nfor comparing packages but the test conditions don’t generally match the user’s application.\n4. θJB, the thermal resistance from junction to the \nprinted circuit board, is the junction-to-board thermal \nresistance where almost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the µModule and into the board, and \nis really the sum of the θ JCbottom  and the thermal \nresistance of the bottom of the part through the solder \njoints and through a portion of the board. The board \ntemperature is measured a specified distance from \nthe package, using a two sided, two layer board. This board is described in JESD 51-9.\nA graphical representation of the aforementioned ther -\nmal resistances is given in Figure 9; blue resistances are \ncontained within the µModule regulator , whereas green \nresistances are external to the µModule.\nAs a practical matter , it should be clear to the reader that \nno individual or sub-group of the four thermal resistance \nparameters defined by JESD 51-12 or provided in the \nPin Configuration section replicates or conveys normal \noperating conditions of a µModule. For example, in nor -\nmal board-mounted applications, never does 100% of \nthe device’ s total power loss (heat) thermally conduct \nexclusively through the top or exclusively through bottom \nof the µModule—as the standard defines for θ JCtop and \nθJCbottom , respectively. In practice, power loss is ther -\nmally dissipated in both directions away from the pack -\nage—granted, in the absence of a heat sink and airflow, a majority of the heat flow is into the board.\nLTM4620A23\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620AFigure 9.

To \nreconcile this complication without sacrificing modeling simplicity—but also, not ignoring practical realities—an \napproach has been taken using FEA software modeling \nalong with laboratory testing in a controlled-environment chamber to reasonably define and correlate the thermal resistance values supplied in this data sheet: (1) Initially, FEA software is used to accurately build the mechanical geometry of the µModule and the specified PCB with all \nof the correct material coefficients along with accurate \npower loss source definitions; (2) this model simulates \na software-defined JEDEC environment consistent with \nJESD 51-9 to predict power loss heat flow and tempera-ture readings at different interfaces that enable the cal -\nculation of the JEDEC-defined thermal resistance values; (3) the model and FEA software is used to evaluate the µModule with heat sink and airflow;  (4) having solved \nfor and analyzed these thermal resistance values and \nsimulated various operating conditions in the software \nmodel, a thorough laboratory evaluation replicates the \nsimulated conditions with thermocouples within a con-\ntrolled-environment chamber while operating the device at the same power loss as that which was simulated. An \noutcome of this process and due-diligence yields a set \nof derating curves provided in other sections of this data \nsheet. After these laboratory test have been performed \nand correlated to the µModule model, then the θ JB and \nθBA are summed together to correlate quite well with the \nµModule model with no airflow or heat sinking in a prop -\nerly define chamber . This θ JB +  θBA value is shown in the \nPin Configuration section and should accurately equal the \nθJA value  because approximately 100% of power loss \nflows from the junction through the board into ambient \nwith no airflow or top mounted heat sink. Each system has \nits own thermal characteristics, therefore thermal analysis \nmust be performed by the user in a particular system.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTM4620A24\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620AThe LTM4620A module has been designed to effectively \nremove heat from both the top and bottom of the pack -\nage. The bottom substrate material has very low thermal \nresistance to the printed circuit board and the exposed \ntop metal is thermally connected to the power devices \nand the power inductors. An external heat sink can be \napplied to the top of the device for excellent heat sinking \nwith airflow. Basically all power dissipating devices are \nmounted directly to the substrate and the top exposed \nmetal. This provides two low thermal resistance paths to remove heat.\nFigure 10 shows a temperature plot of the LTM4620A \nwith BGA heat sink and 200LFM airflow with ~ 5.3W of \ninternal dissipation.\nFigure 11 shows a temperature plot of the LTM4620A with \nno heat sink and 200LFM airflow with ~6.5W of internal \ndissipation.\nThese plots equate to a paralleled 1.2V at 26A design, and \na 5V at 25A design operating from a 12V input.\nSafety Considerations\nThe LTM4620A modules do not provide isolation from \nVIN to V OUT. There is no internal fuse. If required, a slow \nblow fuse with a rating twice the maximum input cur -\nrent needs to be provided to protect each unit from cata-\nstrophic failure. \nThe fuse or \ncircuit breaker should be selected to limit the \ncurrent to the regulator during overvoltage in case of an \ninternal top MOSFET fault. If the internal top MOSFET fails, \nthen turning it off will not resolve the overvoltage, thus \nthe internal bottom MOSFET will turn on indefinitely trying \nto protect the load. Under this fault condition, the input \nvoltage will source very large currents to ground through the failed internal top MOSFET and enabled internal bot -\ntom MOSFET . This can cause excessive heat and board \ndamage depending on how much power the input voltage \ncan deliver to this system. A fuse or circuit breaker can be used as a secondary fault protector in this situation.Figure 10. LTM4620A 12V to 1.2V at 26A with 200LFM Airflow\nFigure 11. LTM4620A 12V to 5V at 25A with 200LFM AirflowAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n\nLTM4620A25\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620AThe device does support over current protection. A tem -\nperature diode is provided for monitoring internal tem-\nperature, and can be used to detect the need for thermal \nshutdown that can be done by controlling the RUN pin.\nPower Derating\nThe 1V, 2.5V and 5V power loss curves in Figures 12 to 14 \ncan be used in coordination with the load current derating \ncurves in Figures 15 to 24 for calculating an approxi -\nmate θJA thermal resistance for the LTM4620A with vari -\nous heat sinking and airflow conditions. The power loss \ncurves are taken at room temperature, and are increased \nwith a 1.35 to 1.4 multiplicative factor at \n125°C. These \nfactors come from the fact that the power loss of the \nregulator increases about 45% from 25°C to 150°C, thus \na 45% spread over 125°C  delta equates to ~0.35%/° C loss \nincrease. A 125°C maximum junction minus 25°C room \ntemperature equates to a 100°C  increase. This 100°C \nincrease multiplied by 0.35%/° C equals a 35% power loss \nincrease at the 125°C junction, thus the 1.35 multiplier . \nThe derating curves are plotted with CH1 and CH2 in \nparallel single output operation starting at 26A of load \nwith low ambient temperature. The output voltages are \n1V, 2.5V and 5V. These are chosen to include the lower and higher output voltage ranges for correlating the ther -\nmal resistance. Thermal models are derived from several temperature measurements in a controlled temperature chamber along with thermal modeling analysis. \nThe junction temperatures are monitored while ambient \ntemperature is increased with and without airflow. The \npower loss increase with ambient temperature change \nis factored into the derating curves. The junctions are \nmaintained at ~ 120°C  maximum while lowering output \ncurrent or power while increasing ambient temperature. \nThe decreased output current will decrease the internal module loss as ambient temperature is increased. The monitored junction temperature of 120°C minus the \nambient operating temperature specifies how much mod -\nule temperature rise can be allowed. As an example in  \nFigure 15, the load current is derated to ~19A at ~80°C with no air or heat sink and the power loss for the 12V to 1.0V at 19A output is a ~5.1W loss. The 5.1W loss is calculated with the ~3.75W room temperature loss from the 12V to 1.0V power loss curve at 19A, and the 1.35 \nmultiplying factor at 125°C  ambient. If the 80°C  ambi -\nent temperature is subtracted from the 120°C  junction \ntemperature, then the difference of 40°C  divided 5.1W  \nequals a 7.8°C/W θJA thermal resistance. Table 2 specifies \na 6.5 to 7°C/W value which is pretty close. The airflow graphs are more accurate due to the fact that the ambient \ntemperature environment is controlled better with airflow. \nAs an example in Figure 16, the load current is derated to ~22A at ~90°C with 200LFM of airflow and the power loss for the 12V to 1.0V at 22A output is a ~5.94W loss. \nThe 5.94W loss is calculated with the ~ 4.4W room temper -\nature loss from the 12V to 1.0V power loss curve at 22A, and the 1.35 multiplying factor at 125°C ambient. If the 90°C ambient temperature is subtracted from the 120°C junction temperature, then the difference of 30°C divided 5.94W equals a 5.1°C/W θ\nJA thermal resistance. Table 2 \nspecifies a 5.5°C /W value which is pretty close. Tables 2-4 \nprovide equivalent thermal resistances for 1.0V, 2.5V and \n5V outputs with and without airflow and heat sinking. \nThe derived thermal resistances in Tables 2-4 for the vari -\nous conditions can be multiplied by the calculated power loss as a function of ambient temperature to derive tem-\nperature rise above ambient, thus maximum junction tem -\nperature.

However , to optimize its \nelectrical and thermal performance, some layout consid -\nerations are still necessary.•\n Use large PCB copper areas for high current paths, \nincluding V IN, GND, V OUT1 and V OUT2. It helps to mini -\nmize the PCB conduction loss and thermal stress.\n• Place high frequency ceramic input and output capac -\nitors next to the V IN, PGND and V OUT pins to minimize \nhigh frequency noise.\n• Place a dedicated power ground layer underneath the \nunit.\n• To minimize the via conduction loss and reduce mod-\nule thermal stress, use multiple vias for interconnec -\ntion between top layer and other power layers.• Do not put via directly on the pad, unless they are \ncapped or plated over .\n• Use a separated SGND ground copper area for com -\nponents connected to signal pins. Connect the SGND \nto GND underneath the unit. \n• For parallel modules, tie the V OUT, VFB, and COMP pins \ntogether . Use an internal layer to closely connect these \npins together . The TRACK pin can be tied a common capacitor for regulator soft-start.\n• Bring out test points on the signal pins for monitoring.\nFigure 25 gives a good example of the recommended \nlayout. \nLTM4620A31\n4620afc\nFor more information www.linear .com/LTM4620AFigure 25.
