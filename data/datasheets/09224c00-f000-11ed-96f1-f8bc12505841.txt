ISSI’s “Indus try Standard Serial Interface” F lash is for systems that \nrequire  limited space, a low pin count , and low power  consumption . The device  is accessed through a 4 -wire SPI \nInterface consisting of a Serial Data Input ( SI), Serial Data Output (SO), Serial Clock (SCK), and Chip Enable \n(CE#) pins, whi ch can also be configured to serve as multi -I/O (see pin descriptions).  \n \nThe device supports  Dual and Quad I/O as well as standard , Dual Output, and Quad Output SPI. Clock frequencies \nof up to 1 66MHz allow for equivalent clock rates of up to 664MHz (1 66MHz x 4) which equates to 83Mbytes/s  of \ndata throughput. The IS25xP series of F lash adds support for DTR  (Double Transfer  Rate ) commands that transfer \naddress es and read data on both edges of the clock.  These transfer rates can outperform 16 -bit Parallel Flash \nmemories allowing for efficient memory access to support XIP  (execute in p lace) operation.  \n \nInitial state of the memory array is erased (all bits are set to 1) when shipped from the factory.  \n \nQPI (Quad Periphe ral Interface) supports 2 -cycle instruction further reducing instruction times. Pages can be \nerased in groups of 4Kbyte sectors, 32Kbyte blocks, 64Kbyte blocks, and/or the entire chip. The uniform sector \nand block  architecture  allow s for a high degree of flexibility so that the device can be utilized for a broad variety of \napplications requiring solid data retention.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSupply Voltage & Temperature Range vs. Maximum Speed  \n \n Voltage & Temp.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \nSYMBOL  TYPE  DESCRIPTION  \nCE# INPUT  Chip Enable:  The Chip Enable (CE#) pin enables and disables the devices \noperation. When CE# is high the device is deselected and output pins are in a high \nimpedance state. When deselected the devices non -critical internal circuitry power \ndown to allow minimal levels o f power consumption while in a standby state.  \nWhen CE# is pulled low the device will be selected and brought out of standby mode. \nThe device is considered active and instructions can be written to, data read, and \nwritten to the device. After power -up, CE# must transition from high to low before a \nnew instruction will be accepted.  \nKeeping CE# in a high state deselects the device and switches it into its low power \nstate. Data will not be accepted when CE# is high.  \nSI (IO0),  \nSO (IO1)  INPUT/OUTPUT  Serial Data  Input, Serial Output, and IOs (SI, SO, IO0, and IO1):  \nThis device supports standard SPI, Dual SPI, and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI \ninstructions use the unidirectional SI (Serial Input) pin to write instructions, \naddresses, or data to the device on th e rising edge of the Serial Clock (SCK). \nStandard SPI also uses the unidirectional SO (Serial Output) to read data or status \nfrom the device on the falling edge of the serial clock (SCK).  \nIn Dual and Quad SPI mode, SI and SO become bidirectional IO pins to  write \ninstructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of the Serial Clock \n(SCK) and read data or status from the device on the falling edge of SCK. Quad \nSPI instructions use the WP# and HOLD# pins as IO2 and IO3 respectively.  \nWP# (IO 2) INPUT/OUTPUT  Write Protect/Serial Data IO (IO2):  The WP# pin protects the Status Register from \nbeing written in conjunction with the SRWD bit. When the SRWD is set to “1” and the \nWP# is pulled low, the Status Register bits (SRWD, QE, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0)  are \nwrite -protected and vice -versa for WP# high. When the SRWD is set to “0”, the Status \nRegister is not write -protected regardless of WP# state.  \nWhen the QE bit is set to “1”, the WP# pin (Write Protect) function is not available \nsince this pin is used for I O2. \nHOLD# (IO3)  \nor \nRESET # (IO3) \n INPUT/OUTPUT  HOLD# or RESET#/Serial Data IO (IO3):  When the QE bit of Status Register is set \nto “1”, HOLD# pin or RESET# is not available since it becomes IO3.  \nMost packages except for 16 -pin SOIC and 24 -ball BGA:  \nWhen QE=0 , the pin acts as HOLD# or RESET#  and either one can be selected by \nthe P7 bit setting in Read Register. HOLD# will be selected if P7=0 (Default) and \nRESET# will be selected if P7=1 . \n16-pin SOIC and 24 -ball BGA package s : \n- When QE=0 and Dedicated RESET#  is Enabled  (Default) , the pin acts as \nHOLD# regardless of the P7 bit setting in Read Register.  \n \n- When QE=0 and Dedicated RESET# is Disabled , the pin acts as HOLD# or \nRESET#  and either one can be selected by the P7 bit setting in Read Register. \nHOLD# will b e selected if P7=0 (Default) and RESET# will be selected if P7=1 . \n \nThe HOLD# pin allows the device to be paused while it is selected. It p auses serial \ncommunication by the master device without resetting the serial sequence. The \nHOLD# pin is active low. When HOLD# is in a low state and CE# is low, the SO pin \nwill be at high impedance. Device operation can resume when HOLD# pin is brought \nto a high state.  \n \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       10   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \n \nSYMBOL  TYPE  DESCRIPTION  \nRESET#  INPUT/OUTPUT  RESET#:  This dedicated RESET# is available in 16-pin SOIC and 24 -ball BGA  \npackages . \nThe RESET# pin is a hardware RESET signal.

SPI MODES DESCRIPTION  \nMultiple IS25LP 128F device s or multiple IS25WP 128F devices can be connected on the SPI serial bus and \ncontrolled by a SPI Master, i.e. micro controller, as shown in Figure 4.1. The devices support either of two SPI \nmodes:  \n \nMode 0 (0, 0)  \nMode 3 (1, 1)  \n \nThe difference between these two  modes is the clock polarity . When the SPI master is in stand-by mode , the serial \nclock remains at “0” (SCK = 0) for Mode 0 and the clock remains at “1” (SCK = 1) for Mode 3.  Please refer to Figure \n4.2 and Figure 4 .3 for SPI and QPI mode . In both modes, the input data is latched on the rising edge of Serial Clock \n(SCK), and the output data is available from the falling edge of SCK.  \n \nFigure 4.1 Connection Diagram among SPI Master and SPI Slaves (Memory Devices)  \nSPI interface with\n(0,0) or (1,1)\nSPI Master\n(i.e. Microcontroller )\nSPI\nMemory\nDeviceSPI\nMemory\nDeviceSPI\nMemory\nDeviceSCK SO SISCKSDISDO\nCE#\nWP#SCK SO SI\nCE#\nWP#SCK SO SI\nCE#\nWP#HOLD # \nor RESET #CS3 CS2 CS1\nHOLD # \nor RESET #HOLD # \nor RESET #\n \nNotes: \n1.

The default value of the BP 0, BP1, BP 2, BP3, QE, and SRWD bits were set \nto “0” at factory.  \n \nThe function of Status Register bits are described as follows:  \n \nWIP bit : Write In P rogress (WIP) is read -only, and can be used to detect the progress or completion of a Program, \nErase, Write/Set Non -Volatile/OTP Register, or Gang Sector/Block Lock/Unlock operation . WIP is set to “1” (busy \nstate) when the device is executing the operation . During this time the device will ignore further instructions except \nfor Read Status/Function/Extended Read Register and Software/Hardware Reset instruction s. In addition to the \ninstructions, an Erase/Program Suspend instruction also can be executed  during a Program or Erase operation.  \nWhen an operation has completed, WIP is  clear ed to “0” (ready state)  whether the operation is successful or not  \nand the device is ready for further instructions . \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       21   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \n \nWEL bit : Write Enable Latch (WEL)  bit indicates the status of the internal write enable latch.

Through these two protection methods, user can disable or enable the \nprogra mming or erasing operation to any or all blocks including 32 top 4K sectors or 32 bottom 4K sectors . The \nFigure 7.1 shows an overview of these methods.  \n \nEvery main flash array block /top sector/bottom sector  has a non-volatile  (PPB) and a volatile  (DYB) pr otection bit \nassociated with it. When either bit is 0, the sector is protected from program and erase operations.  \n \nThe PPB bits are protected from program and erase when the PPB Lock bit is “0”. The PPB bits are erased so that \nall main flash array sectors are unprotected when shipped from factory.  \n \nThere are two methods for managing the state of the PPB Lock bit, Persistent Protection and Password Protection.  \n \nThe Persistent Protection Mode sets the PPB Lock bit  to “1” during power up or Hardware R eset so that the PPB \nbits are unprotected. There is a WRPLB command  to clear the PPB Lock bit to “0” to protect the PPB bits.  There \nis no command in the Persistent Protection method to set the PPB Lock bit  therefore the PPB Lock bit will remain \nat “0” until the next power  up or Hardware R eset. The Persistent Protection method allows boot code the option of \nchanging sector protection by programming or erasing the PPB, then protecting the PPB from further change for \nthe remainder of normal system operation by  clearing the PPB Lock bit. This is sometimes called Boot -code \ncontrolled sector protection.  \n \nThe Password Protection Mode requires use of a password to control PPB protection. In t he Password Protection \nMode , the PPB Lock bit  is cleared  to “0”  during powe r up or Hardware R eset to protect the PPB  bits. A 64 -bit \npassword may be permanently programmed and hidden for the Password Protection Mode . The UNPWD command \ncan be used to provide a password for comparison with the hidden password. If the password matche s the PPB \nLock bit  is set to “1”  to unprotect the PPB. The WRPLB command  can be used to clear the PPB Lock bit  to “0” . \nAfter clearing the PPB Lock bit  to “0”, the UNPWD command can be used again to unprotect the PPB.  \n \nThe selection of the PPB Lock bit man agement method is made by programming OTP bits in the ASP Register so \nas to permanently select the method used.  \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       37   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \nFigure 7.1 Advanced  Sector /Block  Protection  \n \nDYB 0\nDYB 1\nDYB 2\nDYB 3Sector /Block 0\nSector /Block 1\nSector /Block 2\nSector /Block 3PPB 0\nPPB 1\nPPB 2\nPPB 3\nDYB N -3\nDYB N -2\nDYB N -1\nDYB NSector /Block N -3\nSector /Block N -2\nSector /Block N -1\nSector /Block NPPB N -3\nPPB N -2\nPPB N -1\nPPB N0 = Locked64-bit Password \n(OTP)Password Protection \nMode (ASPR [2]=0Persistent Protection \nMode (ASPR [1]=0ASP Register Bits (OTP) \nPPB Memory Array DYB\n1. 0 = Sector /Block Protected\n    1 = Sector /Block Unprotected (default )\n2.

It is programmed individually but must be erased as a group, similar to the way individual words \nmay be programmed in the main array but an entire sector /block  must be erased at the same time.  The PPBs  have  \nthe same endurances as the Flash memory . Preprogramming and verification prior to erasur e are handled by the \ndevice, and therefore do not require system monitoring. Programming a PPB bit requires the typical page \nprogramming time. Erasing all the PPBs requires typical sector erase time. During PPB bit programming and PPB \nbit erasing, status i s available by reading the Status Register  or Extended Read Register . Reading of a PPB bit \nrequires the initial access time of the device.  \n \nNotes : \n1. Each PPB is individually programmed  to “0”  and all are erased to “1” in parallel.  \n2. The PPB Lock bit  must be cleared first before changing the status of a PPB.  \n3. While programming PPB, array data cannot be read from any sectors /blocks .  \n4. When reading the PPB of the desired sector/block the address should be location zero within the sector/block. The high \norder address bits not used must be zero.  \n5. There are no means for individually erasing a specific PPB and no specific sector /block  address is required for this operation.  \n6. The state of the PPB for a given sector /block  can be verified by using  a PPB Read comman d. \n7. When the parts are first shipped, the PPBs are cleared (erased to “1”).  \n \nDynamic Protection Bits  (DYB s) \nDynamic Protection Bits (DYBs) are volatile and unique for each sector /block  and can be individually modified. \nDYBs only control the protection for unprotected sectors /blocks  that have their PPBs cleared (erased to “1”). By \nissuing the Write DYB command, the DYBs are cleared  to “0” or set to “1”, thus placing each sector /block  in the \nprotected or unprotected state respectively. This feature allows software to easily protect sectors /blocks  against \ninadvertent changes , yet does not prevent the easy removal of protection when changes are needed . The DYBs \ncan be set or cleared as often  as needed as they are volatile bits.  \n \nPersistent Protection Bit  (PPB)  Lock Bit  \nThe PPB Lock bit  is a volatile bit for protecting all PPB bits . When cleared to “0” , it locks all PPBs and when set to \n“1”, it allows the PPBs to be changed.  . If the PPB Lock bit is “0”, the PPB Program or Erase command does not \nexecute and fails without programming or erasing the PPB.  \n \nIn Persistent Protection mode, the PPB Lock bit is set to “1” during power up or Hardware Reset. When cleared to \n“0”, no software command sequence can set the PPB Lock bit to “1”, only another Hardware Reset or power -up \ncan set the PPB Lock bit.  \n \nIn the Password Protection mode, the PPB Lock bit is cleared to “0” during power up or a Hardware Reset during \npower up or a Hardware Reset during power up or a Hardware Reset. The PPB  Lock bit can only be set to “1” by \nthe Password Unlock command.  \n \nThe PPB Lock bit  must be cleared  to “0” only after all PPBs are configured to the desired settings . \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       41   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \nSector /Block  Protection States Summary  \nEach sector  in specific blocks and each of all other blocks except for the specific blocks  can be in one of the \nfollowing protection states:  \n\uf0b7 Unlocked – The sector /block  is unprotected and protection can be changed by a simple command. The  \nprotection state defaults to  unprotected after a power cycle, software reset, or hardware reset.  \n\uf0b7 Dynamically Locked – A sector /block  is protected and protection can be changed by a simple command. The  \nprotection state is not saved across a power cycle . \n\uf0b7 Persistently Locked – A sector /block  is protected and protection can only be changed if the PPB Lock bit  is set  \nto “1”. The protection state is non -volatile and saved across a power cycle or reset. Changing the protection  \nstate requires programming and or erase of the PPB bits . \n \nTable 7.4 contains all possible combinations of the DYB, PPB, and PPB Lock bit  relating to the status of the \nsector /block . In summary, if the PPB Lock bit  is locked ( cleared  to “0”), no changes to the PPBs are allowed. The \nPPB Lock bit  can only be unlocked  (set to “1”) through a Hardware Reset or power cycle.  \n \nTable 7.4  Sector/Block Protection States  \n“0” = Locked or Protected  \n“1” = Unlocked or Unprotected  Protection Bit values  \nAssigned Sector/Block State  \nPPB DYB  \n1 1 Unprotected  \n1 0 Protected  \n0 1 Protected  \n0 0 Protected  \nPPB Lock Bit  1 Changeable  Changeable   \n0 NOT changeable  Changeable  \n \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       42   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \nPersistent Protection Mode  \nThe Persistent Protection Mode  sets the PPB Lock bit  to “1” during power up  or Hardware Reset so that the PPB  \nbits are unprotected by a device Hardware R eset. Software Reset does not affect the PPB Lock bit . The  WRPLB \ncommand can clear the PPB Lock bit  to “0” to protect the PPB. There is no command to set the PPB Lock bit  \ntherefore the PPB Lock bit  will remain at “0” until the next power  up or Hardware R eset.  \n \nPassword Protection Mode  \nThe Password Protection Mode allows an even higher level of security than the Persistent Protection Mode by \nrequiring a 64 -bit password for unlocking the device PPB Lock bit . In addition to this password requirement, after \npower up or Hardware Reset, the PPB Lock bit  is cleared to  “0” to maintain the password mode of operation. \nSuccessful execution of the Unlock Password command by entering the entire password sets the PPB Lo ck bit  to \n“1”, allowing for sector/block  PPBs modifications.  \n \nNotes:  \n1. The password is all “1”s when shipped from Factory. It is located in its own memory space and is accessible through the use \nof the Program Password and Read Password commands.  \n2. Once the Password is programmed and verified, the Password Protection Mode  Lock Bit  (ASPR[2]=0) in ASP Register must \nbe programmed  in order to  prevent reading or modifying the password.  After t he Password Protection Mode  Lock Bit is  \nprogrammed, all further  Program and Read commands to the password region are disabled and these commands are \nignored  so that  there is no means to verify what the password is. Password verification is only allowed before sel ecting the \nPassword Protection M ode. \n3. The Program Passwor d Command is only capable of programming “0”s. Programming a “1” after a cell is  programmed as a \n“0” results in the cell left as a “0” with no programming error.  \n4. All 64 -bit password combinations are valid as a password.  \n5. The Protection Mode Lock Bits  in ASP  Register  are not erasable  because they are OTP . \n6. The exact password must be entered in order for the unlocking function to occur. If the password provided by U nlock  \nPassword command  does not match the hidden internal password, the unlock operation fails in  the same manner as a \nprogramming operation on a protected sector/block . The P_ERR and PROT_E are  set to 1 and the PPB Lock bit remains \ncleared to 0. In this case it is a failure to change the state of the PPB Lock bit because it is still  protected by the lack of a \nvalid password.  \n7. The Unlock Password command cannot be accepted any faster than once every 100μs ± 20μs. This  makes it take an \nunreasonably long time (58 million years) for a hacker to run through all the 64 -bit combinations in an attempt to corre ctly \nmatch a password. The Read Stat us Register command or the Read Extended Read Register may be  used to read the WIP \nbit to determine when the device has completed the Unlock P assword command or is  ready to accept a new password \ncommand. When a valid pas sword is provided the Unlock P assword command does not insert the 100μs delay before \nreturning the WIP bit to zero.  \n8. If the password is lost after selecting the Password  Protection  Mode, there is no way to set the PPB Lock bit.  \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       43   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \n8. DEVICE OPERATION  \n8.1 COMMAND  OVERVIEW  \nThe device  utilizes an 8 -bit instruction register. Refer to Table 8. 3. Instruction Set for details on instructions and \ninstruction codes. All instructions, addresses, and data are shifted in with the most significant bit (MS B) first  on \nSerial Dat a Input (SI) or Serial Data IOs (IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3). The input data on SI or IOs is latched on the rising \nedge of Serial Clock (SCK) for normal mode and both of rising and falling edges for DTR mode after Chip Enable \n(CE#) is driven low (V IL). Every instr uction sequence starts with a one -byte instruction code a nd is followed by \naddress bytes and /or dummy cycles  (configurable)  and/or data bytes, depending on the type of instruction. CE# \nmust be driven high (V IH) after the last bit of the instruction sequence has been shifted in to end the operation.  \n \nCommands are structured as follows:  \n\uf0b7 Each command begins with a byte (eight bits ) instruction.  \n\uf0b7 The instruction may be stand alone or may be followed by address bits to select a location within one of  several \naddress spaces in the device. The address may be either a 24 -bit or 32 -bit byte boundary address.  \n\uf0b7 The SPI interface with Multiple IO provides the option for each transfer of address and data  information to be \ndone one, two, or four bits in parallel . This enables a tradeoff  between the number of  signal connections (IO bus \nwidth) and the speed of information transfer. If the host system can support a  two or four bit wide IO bus the \nmemory performance can be increased by using the instructions that  provide parallel two bit (dual) or parallel \nfour bit (quad) transfers.  \n\uf0b7 The width of all transfers following the instruction are determined by the instruction sent.  \n\uf0b7 All single  bit or parallel bit groups are transferred in most to least significant bit order.  \n\uf0b7 Some instructions send Mode Bits following the address to indicate that the next  command will be of the same \ntype with an implied, rather than an explicit, instruction. The next command  thus does not provide an instruction \nbyte, only a new address and mode  bits. This reduces the time needed  to send each command when the same \ncommand type is repeated in a sequence of commands.  \n\uf0b7 The address or Mode Bits may be followed by Dummy Cycles  before read data is returned to the host.  \n\uf0b7 Dummy Cycles  may be zero to severa l SCK cycles . In fact, Mode Bits will be counted as a part of Dummy \nCycles.  \n\uf0b7 All instruction, address, Mode, and data information is transferred in byte granularity. Addresses are shifted  into \nthe device with the Most Significant Byte first. All data is tra nsferred with the lowest address byte sent  first. \nFollowing bytes of data are sent in lowest to highest byte address order i.e. the byte address  increments.  \n\uf0b7 All attempts to read the flash memory array during a program, erase, or a write cycle (embedded  operations) \nare ignored. The embedded operation will continue to execute without any affect. A very  limited set of commands \nare accepted during an embedded operation. These are discussed in the  individual command descriptions. \nWhile a program, erase, or write  operation is in progress, it is  recommended to check that the Write In  Progress \n(WIP) bit is “0” before issuing most commands to the  device, to ensure the new command can be accepted.  \n\uf0b7 Depending on the command, the time for execution varies. A command to read status information from an  \nexecuting command is available to determine when the command completes execution and whether the  \ncommand was successful.  \n\uf0b7 Following are some general signal  relationship descriptions to keep in mind . \n– The host always controls t he Chip Enable  (CE#), Serial Clock (SCK), and Serial Input (SI) - SI for single  bit \nwide transfers. The memory drives Serial Output (SO) for single bit read transfers. The host and  memory \nalternately drive the IO0 -IO3 signals during Dual and Quad transfers . \n– All commands begin with the host selecting the memory by driving C E# low before the first rising edge of \nSCK. C E# is kept low throughout a command and when C E# is returned high the command ends.  \nGenerally, C E# remains low for 8 -bit transfer multiples to transfer byte granularity information. All commands \nwill not be accepted if C E# is returned high not at an 8 -bit boundary.  \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       44   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \n8.2 COMMAND  SET SUMMARY  \n \nExtended Addressing  \nTo accommodate addressing above 128Mb (24 -bit), there are three options:  \n \n1.

A total of 24 or 32 address bits are shifted in, but \nonly AVMSB (Valid Most Significant  Bit) - A0 are decoded. The remaining bits (A31 – AVMSB+1) are ignored. The first \nbyte addressed can be at any memory location. Upon completion, any data on the SI will be ignored. Refer to Table \n8.4 for the related Address Key.  \n \nThe first byte data (D7 - D0) is shifted out on the SO line, MSB first. A single byte of data, or up to the whole memory \narray, can be read out in one Normal Read instruction. The address is automatically incremented by one after each \nbyte of data is shifted o ut. The read operation can be terminated at any time by driving CE# high (VIH) after the \ndata comes out. When the highest address of the device is reached, the address counter will roll over to the \n000000h address, allowing the entire memory to be read in one continuous Read instruction.  \n \nIf the Normal Read instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write operation is in process (WIP=1) the \ninstruction is ignored and will not have any effects on the current operation . \n \nTable 8.4  Address Key  \nMode  Valid Address  128Mb  \n3 byte address  \nAVMS B(2)–A0 A23-A0 \n4 byte address  A23-A0 (A31 -A24=X)(2) \nNote s:  \n1.

This \nmay a llow for code to be executed directly from the SPI in some applications.  \n \n\uf0b7 BBh (EXTADD=0) is followed by a 3 -byte address (A23 -A0) or  \n\uf0b7 BBh (EXTADD=1) is followed by a 4 -byte address (A31 -A0) or  \n\uf0b7 BCh is followed by a 4 -byte address (A31 -A0) \n \nThe FRDIO/4FRDIO instruction code is followed by three or four address bytes as above and dummy cycles \n(configurable, default is 4 clocks) , transmitted via the IO1 and IO0 lines, with each pair of bits latched -in during the \nrising edge of SCK. The address MSB is input on I O1, the next bit on IO0, and this shift pattern continues to \nalternate between the two lines. Depending on the usage of AX read operation mode, a mode byte may be located \nafter address input.  \n \nThe first data byte addressed is shifted out on the IO1 and IO0  lines, with each pair of bits shifted out at a maximum \nfrequency f CT, during the falling edge of SCK. The first bit (MSB) is output on IO1, while simultaneously the second \nbit is output on IO0. Figures 8.7 and 8.8  illustrates the timing sequence.  \n \nThe fir st byte addressed can be at any memory location. The address is automatically incremented by one after \neach byte of data is shifted out. When the highest address is reached, the address counter will roll over to the \n000000h address, allowing the entire mem ory to be read with a single FRDIO/4FRDIO instruction. The \nFRDIO/4FRDIO instruction is terminated by driving CE# high (V IH). \n \nThe device supports the AX read operation by applying mode bits during dummy period. Mode bits consist of 8 \nbits, such as M7 to M0. Four cycles after address input are reserved for Mode bits in FRDIO/4FRDIO execution. \nM7 to M4 are important for enabling th is mode. M3 to M0 become don’t care for future use. When M[7:4]=1010(Ah), \nit enables the AX read operation and subsequent FRDIO/4FRDIO execution skips command code. It saves cycles \nas described in Figures 8.9 and 8.10 . When the code is different from AXh ( where X is don’t care), the device exits \nthe AX read operation. After finishing the read operation, device becomes ready to receive a new command. SPI \nor QPI mode configuration retains the prior setting. Mode bit must be applied during dummy cycles. Number  of \ndummy cycles in Table 6.11 includes number of mode bit cycles. If dummy cycles are configured as 4 cycles, data \noutput will start right after mode bit is applied.  \n \nIf the FRDIO/4FRDIO instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in p rocess (WIP=1) the \ninstruction is ignored and will not affect the current cycle . \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       61   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \nFigure 8.7  Fast Read Dual I/O Sequence (BBh [EXTADD=0], 3 -byte address)  \n \n7 5 3 7 5 1 3 1Data Out 1Instruction = BBh 22CE#\nSCK\n2 0 6 43-byte Address\nHigh Impedance20 18 ...0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 18 19 20 21\n22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37Mode 3\nMode 0\n...\ntV23 3 1 7 5 21 19...IO0\nIO1\n3 12 0 6 4 2 6 4 0 2 04 Dummy Cycles\n7 5 3 16 4 2 0\n7 5 ...6 4 ...CE#\nSCK\nIO0\nIO1Data Out 2 Data Out 3Mode Bits\nMode Bits\n \nNotes:  \n1.

The destination of the memory to be programmed must be outside the protected memory area  set by \nthe Block Protection bits (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) or ASP. A PP/4PP instruction which attempts to program into a \npage that is write -protected will be ignored.

Program operation will start immediately after the CE# is brought high, otherwise the PP/4PP instruction \nwill not be executed. The internal control logic automatically handles the programming voltages and timing. The \nprogress or completion of the program operation can be determined by reading the WIP bit. If the WIP bit is “1”, \nthe program operation is still in progress. If WIP bit is “0”, the program operation has completed.  \n \nIf mo re than 256 bytes data are sent to a device, the address counter rolls over within the same page, the previously \nlatched data are discarded, and the last 256 bytes are kept to be programmed into the page. The starting byte can \nbe anywhere within the page. When the end of the page is reached, the address will wrap around to the beginning \nof the same page. If the data to be programmed are less than a full page, the data of all other bytes on the same \npage will remain unchanged.  \nNote:  A program operation can a lter “1”s into “0” s.

During this mode, standby current is reduced from I sb1 to I sb2. While in the Power -down \nmode, the device is not active and all  Write/Program/Erase instructions are ignored. The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the CE# pin low and shifting the instruction code into the device. The CE# pin must be driven high after the \ninstruction has been latched, or Power -down mode will not en gage. Once CE# pin driven high, the Power -down \nmode will be entered within the time duration of t DP.

To set those bits the SRPNV \nand SRPV operation instruction are used. Details regarding burst length and dummy cycles can be found in Table \n6.9, Table 6.10, and Table 6.11. HOLD#/ RESET# function  selection (P7) bit in the Read Register can be set with \nthe SRPNV and SRPV operation as well, in order to select HOLD#/RESET#  pin as RESET# or HOLD#.  \nFor the device with dedicated RESET# pin (or ball) , RESET#  pin (or ball)  will be a separate pin  (or ball)  and it is \nindependent of the P7 bit setting in Read Register.  \nSRPNV is used to set the non -volatile Read Register, while SRPV is used to set the volatile Read Register.  \n \nTo write non -volatile Read Parameter bits, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must previously have been \nexecuted  for the device to accept SRPNV(65h) instruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal “1”).  \n \nTo write volatile Read Parameter  bits (SRPV) , 63h or C0h command can be used.  \nWhen using 63h instruction, a standard Write Enable  (06h) instruction must previously have been executed for the \ndevice to accept SRPV (63h) instruction ( Status Register bit WEL must equal “1”).  \nBut C0h instruction  does not require a standard Write Enable (06h)  operation.  (Status Register bit WEL remains \n“0”). \n \nNote: When SRPNV is executed, the volatile Read Register is set as well as the non -volatile Read Register.  \n \nFigure 8.59  Set Read Parameters Sequence  In SPI Mode  \n \nInstruction = 65h or C 0h/63hCE#\nSCK\nSI\nSOData In0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15Mode 3\nMode 0\n7 3 2 1 0 6 5 4\nHigh Impedence\n \n \nFigure 8.60  Set Read Parameters Sequence  In QPI Mode  \n \n65h or \nC0h/63h0 1Mode 3\nMode 02 3\n7:43:0CE#\nSCK\nIO[3:0]\nData In\n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       101   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \nRead with “8/16/32/64 -Byte Wrap Around”  \n \nThe device is capable of burst read with wrap around in both SPI and QPI mode. The size of burst length is \nconfigurable by using P0, P1, and P2 bits in Read Register. P2 bit (Wrap enable) enables the burst mode feature. \nP0 and P1 define the size of burst. Burst lengths of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bytes are supported. By default, address \nincreases by one up through the entire array. By setting the burst length, the data being accessed can be limited \nto the length of burs t boundary within a 256 byte page. The first output will be the data at the initial address which \nis specified in the instruction. Following data will come out from the next address within the burst boundary. Once \nthe address reaches the end of boundary, i t will automatically move to the first address of the boundary. CE# high \nwill terminate the command.  \n \nFor example, if burst length of 8 and initial address being applied is 0h, following byte output will be from address \n00h and continue to 01h,..,07h, 00h,  01h… until CE# terminates the operation. If burst length of 8 and initial address \nbeing applied is FEh(254d), following byte output will be from address FEh and continue to FFh, F8h, F9h, FAh, \nFBh, FCh, FDh, and repeat from FEh until CE# terminates the op eration.  \n \nThe commands, “SRPV (65h) or SRPNV (C0h or 63h)”, are used to configure the burst length. If the following data \ninput is one of “00h”,”01h”,”02h”, and ”03h”, the device will be in default operation mode. It will be continuous burst \nread of the wh ole array. If the following data input is one of “04h”,”05h”,”06h”, and ”07h”, the device will set the \nburst length as 8,16,32 and 64, respectively.  \n \nTo exit the burst mode, another “C0h or 63h” command is necessary to set P2 to 0. Otherwise, the burst mod e will \nbe retained until either power down or reset operation. To change burst length, another “C0h or 63h” command \nshould be executed to set P0 and P1 (Detailed information in Table 6.9 Burst Length Data). All read commands \nwill operate in burst mode once  the Read Register is set to enable burst  mode.  \n \nRefer to Figure 8.59 and Figure 8.60 for instruction sequence.  \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       102   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \n8.27 SET EXTENDED READ PA RAMETERS OPERATION  (SERPNV: 85 h, SERPV: 83 h) \nSet Read Operational Driver Strength  \n \nThis device supports configurable Operational Driver Strength in both SPI and QPI modes  by setting three bits \n(ODS0, ODS1, ODS2) within the Extended Read Register.

The Device ID (ID 7-ID0) outputs repeatedly if additional \nclock cycles are continuously sent to SCK while CE# is at low.  \n \nTable 8.7  Product Identification  \nManufacturer ID  (MF7 -MF0)  \nISSI Serial Flash  9Dh \nInstruction  ABh 90h 9Fh \nPart Number  Device ID (ID7 -ID0) Memory Type + Capacity  \n(ID15 -ID0) \nIS25LP128 F 17h 6018h \nIS25WP128 F 17h 7018 h \n \n \nFigure 8.69  Read Product Identification Sequence  \n \nDevice ID\n(ID7-ID0)Data Out32 33 ... 39\nInstruction = ABhCE#\nSCK\nSI\nSO0 1 ... 7 8 9 ... 31Mode 3\nMode 0\n3 Dummy Bytes\ntV\n \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       107   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \nFigure 8.70  Read Product Identification Sequence  In QPI Mode  \n \nABhCE#\nSCK\nIO[3:0]0 1Mode 3\nMode 02 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n6 Dummy Cy clesDevice ID\n(ID7-ID0)tV\n \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       108   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \n8.32 READ PRODUCT IDENTIF ICATION BY JEDEC ID OPERATION (RDJDID, 9 Fh; RDJDIDQ, AF h) \nThe JEDEC ID READ instruction allows the user to read the manufacturer and product ID of devices.

During the \nReset operation, the value of volatile registers will default back to the value in the corresponding non -volatile \nregister. However, the volatile F REEZE bit and the volatile PPB Lock bit in the PPB Lock Register are not \nchanged by Software Reset . This operation consists of two commands: Reset -Enable (RSTEN) and Reset (RST). \nThe operation requires the Reset -Enable command followed by the Reset command . Any command other than the \nReset command after the Reset -Enable command will disable the Reset -Enable.  \n \n \nExecute the CE# pin low  \uf0e0 sends the Reset -Enable command (66 h), and drives CE# high. Next, the host drives \nCE# low again, sends the Reset command (99 h), and pulls C E# high.  \n \nOnly if the RESET# pin is enabled, Hardware Reset function is available.  \nFor the device with HOLD#/RESET#,  the RESET# pin will be solely applicable in SPI mode and when the QE bit = \n“0”. For the device with dedicated RESET# (Dedicated RESET# Disable bit is “0” in Function Register), the RESET# \npin is always applicable regardless of the QE bit value in Status Register and HOLD#/RESET# selection bit (P7) in \nRead Register in SPI/QPI mode.  \n \nIn order to activate Hardware Reset, the RESET# pin (or ball) must be driven low for a minimum period of t RESET  \n(100ns). Drive RESET# low for a minimum period of t RESET  will interrupt any on -going internal and external \noperations , release the device from deep power down mode1, disable all inp ut signals, force the output pin enter a \nstate of high impedance, and reset all the read parameters.   \nThe required wait time after activating a HW Reset before the device w ill accept another instruction  is t HWRST  of \n35us.  \n \nThe Software/Hardware Reset durin g an active Program or Erase operation aborts the operation, which can result \nin corrupting or losing the data of the targeted address range. Depending on the prior operation, the reset timing \nmay vary. Recovery from a Write operation will require more lat ency than recovery from other operations . \nNote1: The Status and Function Registers remain unaffected.  \n \nFigure 8.77  Software Reset Enable and Software Reset  Sequence ( RSTEN, 66h + RST, 99h )  \n \nInstruction = 66hCE#\nSCK\nSI0 1Mode 3\nMode 02 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction = 99h8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\nSOHigh Impedance\n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       113   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \nFigure 8.78  Software Reset Enable and Software Reset  QPI Sequence ( RSTEN, 66h + RST, 99h ) \n \n66hCE#\nSCK\nIO[3:0]0 1Mode 3\nMode 0\n99h0 1\n \n \n \n8.38 SECURITY INFORMATION  ROW  \nThe security Information Row is comprised of an additional 4 x 256 bytes of programmable information.

Before the execution of IRP instruction, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) must be enabled through \na Write Enable (WREN) instruction.  \n \nThe IRP instruction code, three address bytes and program data (1 to 256 bytes) should be sequentially input. \nThree address bytes has to be inpu t as specified in the Table 8.9  Information Row Valid Address Range. Program \noperation will start once the CE# goes  high, otherwise the IRP instruction will not be executed. The internal control \nlogic automatically handles the programming voltages and timing. During a program operation, all instructions will \nbe ignored except the RDSR instruction. The progress or completio n of the program operation can be determined \nby reading the WIP bit. If the WIP bit is “1”, the program operation is still in progress. If WIP bit is “0”, the program \noperation has completed.  \n \nIf more than 256 bytes data are sent to a device, the address c ounter rolls over within the same page . The \npreviously latched data are discarded and the last 256 bytes data are kept to be programmed into the page. The \nstarting byte can be anywhere within the page. When the end of the page is reached, the address will wrap around \nto the beginning of the same page. If the data to be programmed are less than a full page, the data of all other \nbytes on the same page will remain unchanged.  \nNote: A program operation can alter “1”s into “0”s, but an erase operation is require d to change “0”s back to “1”s. A \nbyte cannot be reprogrammed without first erasing the corresponding Information Row array which is one of \nIR0~3.  \n \nFigure 8.80  IRP (Information Row Program ) Sequence  \n \nInstruction = 62h 23CE#\nSCK\nSI7 6\nSO73-byte Address\nHigh Impedance22...0Data In 1 Data In 2560 1 ... 7 8 9 ... 31 32 33 ... 39 ...\n2072\n...\n2079\nMode 3\nMode 0\n...0... ...0\n \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       116   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \n8.41 INFORMATION ROW READ  OPERATION  (IRRD,  68h) \nThe IRRD  instruction is used to read memory data at up to a 166MHz clock.  \n \nThe IRRD  instruction code is followed by three address bytes (A23 - A0) and dummy cycles (configurable, default \nis 8 clocks) , transmitted via the SI line, with each bit latche d-in during the rising edge of SCK.

The address is latched on both rising and falling edge of SCK, and data of each bit shifts out on both \nrising and falling edge  of SCK . The 2 -bit address can be latched -in at one clock, and 2 -bit data can be read out at \none clock, which means one bit at the rising edge of clock, the other bit at the falling edge of clock.  \n \nThe first address byte can be at any location.

The address is automatically increased to the next higher address \nafter each byte of data is shifted out, so the whole  memory can be read out with a single FRDDTR/ 4FRDDTR  \ninstruction. The address counter rolls over to 0 when the highest ad dress is reached.

It saves cycles as \ndescribed in Figures 8.88 and 8.8 9. When the code is different from AXh (where X is don’t care), the device exits \nthe AX r ead operation.

As a result, 6 command cycles will be \nreduced by the FRQDTR/ 4FRQDTR  instruction  in QPI mode . In addition, subsequent address and data out are \nshifted in/out via all four IO lines like the FRQDTR/ 4FRQDTR  instruction. In fact, except for the command cycle, \nthe FRQDTR/ 4FRQDTR  operation  in QPI mode  is exactly same as the FRQDTR/ 4FRQDTR  operation in SPI mode . \n \n \n\uf0b7 EDh (EXTADD=0) is followed by a 3 -byte address (A23 -A0) or  \n\uf0b7 EDh (EXTADD=1) is followed by a 4 -byte address (A31 -A0) or  \n\uf0b7 EEh is followed by a 4 -byte address (A31 -A0) \n \nThe sequence of issuing FRQDTR/ 4FRQDTR  instruction is: CE# goes low \uf0e0 Sending FRQDTR/ 4FRQDTR  \ninstruction (4 -bit per clock) \uf0e0 24-bit or 32 -bit address interleave on IO3, IO2, IO1 & IO0 (8 -bit per clock) as above \n\uf0e0 6 dummy clocks (configurable, default is 6 clocks) \uf0e0 Data out interleave on IO3, IO2, IO1 & IO0 (8 -bit per clock) \n\uf0e0 End FRQDTR/ 4FRQDTR  operation by driving CE# high at any time during data out.  \n \nIf AXh (where X is don’t care) is input for the mode bits during dummy cycles, the device will enter AX read operation \nmode which enables subsequent FRQDTR /4FRQDTR  in QPI mode  execution skips command code.

And, \nin order to read boot code from an SPI device, the host memory controller or processor must supply the read \ncommand from a hardwired state machine or from some host processor internal ROM code.  \nParallel NOR devices need only an initial address, suppli ed in parallel in a single cycle, and initial access time to \nstart reading boot code.  \nThe AutoBoot feature allows the host memory controller to take boot code from the device immediately after the \nend of reset, without having to send a read command. This saves 32 or more cycles and simplifies the logic needed \nto initiate the reading of boot code.  \n \n\uf0b7 As part of the Power -up Reset, Hardware Reset, or Software Reset process the AutoBoot feature automatically \nstarts a read access from a pre -specified address. At  the time the reset process is completed, the device is \nready to deliver code from the starting address. The host memory controller only needs to drive CE# signal from \nhigh to low and begin toggling the SCK signal. The device will delay code output for a p re-specified number of \nclock cycles before code streams out.  \n \n– The Auto Boot Start Delay (ABSD) field of the AutoBoot register specifies the initial delay if any is needed by \nthe host.  \n– The host cannot send commands during this time.  \n– If QE bit (Bit 6) in the Status Register is set to “1”, Fast Read Quad I /O operation will be selected  and initial \ndelay is the same as dummy cycles of Fast Read Quad I/O Read operation . If it is set to “0”, Fast Read \noperation will be applied  and initial delay is the same as dummy cycles of Fast Read operation . \n \n\uf0b7 The starting address of the boot code is selected by the value programmed into the AutoBoot Start Address \n(ABSA) field of the AutoBoot Register.  \n \n– Data will continuously shift out unt il CE# returns high.  \n \n\uf0b7 At any point after the first data byte is transferred, when CE# returns high, the SPI device will reset to standard \nSPI mode; able to accept normal command operations.  \n \n– A minimum of one byte must be transferred.  \n– AutoBoot mode will  not initiate again until another power cycle or a reset occurs.  \n \n\uf0b7 An AutoBoot Enable bit (ABE) is set to enable the AutoBoot feature.  \n \nThe AutoBoot register bits are non -volatile and provide:  \n\uf0b7 The starting address set by the AutoBoot Start Address (ABSA).  \n\uf0b7 The number of initial delay cycles, set by the AutoBoot Start Delay (ABSD) 4 -bit count value.  \n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       138   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \nFigure 8.102  AutoBoot Sequence (QE = 0)  \n \n7CE#\nSCK\nSI\n3 2SO1 0\nData Out 1High Impedance6 5 40 1 2 ... n-1 n n+1n+2n+3n+4n+5n+6n+7n+8 n+9n+10Mode 3\nMode 0\ntVABSD Delay (n)\n7 6 ...\nData Out 2     ......\n \nFigure 8.103  AutoBoot Sequence (QE = 1)  \n \n4CE#\nSCK\n4 0 4 0\nHigh Impedance0 4 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nIO0\nIO1\nIO2\nIO35 1\nData Out 15 1 5 1 5 1\n7 36 2\n7 3 7 36 2 6 2\n7 36 2\nData Out 2Data Out 3Data Out 4tVABSD Delay (n)0 1 2 ... n-1 n n+1n+2n+3n+4n+5n+6n+7n+8 n+9n+10...\n4 0\n5 1 ...\n7 3 ...6 2 ...\nData Out 5...\n...\n \n  \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       139   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \nAUTOBOOT REGISTER READ OPERATION (RDABR, 14 h) \nThe AutoBoot Register Read command is shifted in.

WRBRNV is used to write the non -volatile Bank Address Register and WRBRV  \nis used to write the volatile Bank Address Register. The instruction is also used to write the Extended Address \nControl bit (EXTADD) that is also in BAR[7]. BAR provides the high order addresses needed by devices having \nmore than 128Mbits (16Mbytes), when  using 3 -byte address commands without extended addressing enabled \n(BAR[7] EXTADD = 0).  \n \nTo write non -volatile Bank Address Register , a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must previously have been \nexecuted  for the device to accept  WRBRNV(18h) instruc tion (Status Register bit WEL must equal “1”).  \n \nTo write volatile Bank Address Register , C5h or 17h command can be used.  \nWhen using C5h instruction, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must previously have been executed for the \ndevice to accept C5h instruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal “1”).  \nBut 17h instruction does not require a standard Write Enable (06h) operation. (Status Register bit WEL remains \n“0”). \n \nThe WRBRN V/WRBRV instruction s are  followed by the data byte. The Bank Address Register is one data byte in \nlength. The Write In Progress (WIP) bit is “1” during WRBRNV /WRBRV  operation, an d is “0” when it is completed. \nAny bank address bit reserved for the future should always be written as “0”. Data is shifted in from SI and in SPI \nwhereas data is shifted in via four pins (IO0 -IO3) in QPI.  \n \nBit 7 (EXTADD) of volatile Bank Address Register  is also writable with EN4B (B7h )/EX4B (29h) instruction.  \nBut B7h/29h instruction does not require a standard Write Enable (06h) (Status Register bit WEL remains 0).  \n \nNote: When WRBRNV is executed, the volatile Bank Address Register is set as well as the non -volatile Bank Address \nRegiste r. \nFigure 8.109  Write Bank Address Register Sequence  In SPI Mode  \n \nInstruction = 18h or 17h/C5hCE#\nSCK\nSI\nSOData In0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15Mode 3\nMode 0\n7 3 2 1 0 6 5 4\nHigh Impedence\n \n \nFigure 8.110  Write Bank Address Register Sequence  In QPI Mode  \n \n18h or\n17h/C5h0 1Mode 3\nMode 02 3\n7:43:0CE#\nSCK\nIO[3:0]\nData In\n \n \n                                                                                                          IS25LP 128F \n                                                                                                          IS25WP128F  \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com       143   \nRev.A6  \n11/18/2020  \n \n8.49 ENTER 4 -BYTE ADDRESS MODE  OPERATION (EN4B, B7 h) \nThe Enter 4 -byte Address Mode instruction allows 32bit address (A31 -A0) to be used to access the memory array \nbeyond 128Mb.
