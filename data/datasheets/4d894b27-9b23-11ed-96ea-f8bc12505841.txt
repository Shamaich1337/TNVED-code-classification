In-tended for low to medium power applications, it eliminates the need for a current sense resistor by utilizing the power MOSFET’s on-resistance, thereby maximizing efﬁ  ciency. \nThe IC’s operating frequency can be set with an external \nresistor over a 50kHz to 1MHz range, and can be syn-chronized to an external clock using the MODE/SYNC pin. Burst Mode operation at light loads, a low minimum operating supply voltage of 2.5V and a low shutdown quiescent current of 10μA make the L TC1871 ideally suited for battery-operated systems. \nFor applications requiring constant frequency opera-\ntion, Burst Mode operation can be defeated using the MODE/SYNC pin. Higher output voltage boost, SEPIC and ﬂ  yback applications are possible with the L TC1871 by connecting the SENSE pin to a resistor in the source of the power MOSFET .\nThe L TC1871 is available in the 10-lead MSOP package.\nEfﬁ  ciency of Figure 1n High Efﬁ  ciency (No Sense Resistor Required)\nn Wide Input Voltage Range: 2.5V to 36V\nn Current Mode Control Provides Excellent \n T ransient Response\nn High Maximum Duty Cycle (92% Typ)\nn ±2% RUN Pin Threshold with 100mV Hysteresis\nn ±1% Internal Voltage Reference\nn Micropower Shutdown: I Q = 10μA\nn Programmable Operating Frequency \n (50kHz to 1MHz) with One External Resistor\nn Synchronizable to an External Clock Up to 1.3 × f OSC\nn User-Controlled Pulse Skip or Burst Mode® Operation\nn Internal 5.2V Low Dropout Voltage Regulator\nn Output Overvoltage Protection\nn Capable of Operating with a Sense Resistor for  \n High Output Voltage Applications\nn Small 10-Lead MSOP Package\nn Telecom Power Supplies\nn Portable Electronic EquipmentL, L T , L TC, L TM and Burst Mode are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation. \nNo R SENSE  is a trademark of Linear Technology Corporation.

The falling RUN pin threshold is nominally 1.248V and the comparator has 100mV of hysteresis for noise immunity. When the RUN pin is below this input threshold, the IC is shut down and the V\nIN supply current is kept to a low \nvalue (typ 10μA). The Absolute Maximum Rating for the voltage on this pin is 7V .\nI\nTH (Pin 2):  Error Ampliﬁ  er Compensation Pin. The \ncurrent comparator input threshold increases with this control voltage. Nominal voltage range for this pin is 0V to 1.40V .\nFB (Pin 3):  Receives the feedback voltage from the external \nresistor divider across the output. Nominal voltage for this pin in regulation is 1.230V .\nFREQ (Pin 4):  A resistor from the FREQ pin to ground \nprograms the operating frequency of the chip. The nominal voltage at the FREQ pin is 0.6V .\nMODE/SYNC (Pin 5):  This input controls the operating \nmode of the converter and allows for synchronizing the operating frequency to an external clock. If the MODE/\nSYNC pin is connected to ground, Burst Mode operation is enabled. If the MODE/SYNC pin is connected to INTV\nCC, \nor if an external logic-level synchronization signal is ap-plied to this input, Burst Mode operation is disabled and the IC operates in a continuous mode.\nGND (Pin 6):  Ground Pin. \nGATE (Pin 7):  Gate Driver Output.\nINTV CC (Pin 8):  The Internal 5.20V Regulator Output. \nThe gate driver and control circuits are powered from this voltage.

The L TC1871 is distinguished from conventional current mode controllers because the current control loop can be closed by sensing the voltage drop across the power MOSFET switch instead of across a discrete sense resistor , as shown in Figure 2. This sensing technique improves efﬁ  ciency, increases power density, and reduces the cost of the overall solution.\nFor circuit operation, please refer to the Block Diagram of \nthe IC and Figure 1. In normal operation, the power MOSFET is turned on when the oscillator sets the PWM latch and is turned off when the current comparator C1 resets the latch. The divided-down output voltage is compared to an internal 1.230V reference by the error ampliﬁ  er EA, which \noutputs an error signal at the I\nTH pin. The voltage on the \nITH pin sets the current comparator C1 input threshold. \nWhen the load current increases, a fall in the FB voltage relative to the reference voltage causes the I\nTH pin to rise, \nwhich causes the current comparator C1 to trip at a higher peak inductor current value. The average inductor current will therefore rise until it equals the load current, thereby maintaining output regulation.OPERATION\nLTC1871\n91871fe OPERATION\nFigure 2. Using the SENSE Pin On the L TC1871reset pulse to the main RS latch. Because this RS latch is \nreset-dominant, the power MOSFET is actively held off for the duration of an output overvoltage condition.\nThe L TC1871 can be used either by sensing the voltage \ndrop across the power MOSFET or by connecting the SENSE pin to a conventional shunt resistor in the source of the power MOSFET , as shown in Figure 2. Sensing the voltage across the power MOSFET maximizes converter efﬁ  ciency and minimizes the component count, but limits the output voltage to the maximum rating for this pin (36V). By connecting the SENSE pin to a resistor in the source of the power MOSFET , the user is able to program output voltages signiﬁ  cantly greater than 36V .\nProgramming the Operating Mode\nFor applications where maximizing the efﬁ  ciency at very \nlight loads (e.g., <100μA) is a high priority, the current in the output divider could be decreased to a few micro-amps and Burst Mode operation should be applied (i.e., the MODE/SYNC pin should be connected to ground). In applications where ﬁ  xed frequency operation is more critical than low current efﬁ  ciency, or where the lowest \noutput ripple is desired, pulse-skip mode operation should be used and the MODE/SYNC pin should be connected to the INTV\nCC pin. This allows discontinuous conduction \nmode (DCM) operation down to near the limit deﬁ  ned \nby the chip’s minimum on-time (about 175ns). Below this output current level, the converter will begin to skip cycles in order to maintain output regulation. Figures 3 and 4 show the light load switching waveforms for Burst Mode and pulse-skip mode operation for the converter in Figure 1.\nBurst Mode Operation\nBurst Mode operation is selected by leaving the MODE/\nSYNC pin unconnected or by connecting it to ground. In normal operation, the range on the I\nTH pin corresponding to \nno load to full load is 0.30V to 1.2V . In Burst Mode opera-tion, if the error ampliﬁ  er EA drives the I\nTH voltage below \n0.525V , the buffered I TH input to the current comparator \nC1 will be clamped at 0.525V (which corresponds to 25% of maximum load current). The inductor current peak is then held at approximately 30mV divided by the power COUT\nVSW\nVSW2a.

In addition, the internal oscillator can be synchronized to an external clock applied to the MODE/SYNC pin and can be locked to a frequency between 100% and 130% of its nominal value. When the MODE/SYNC pin is left open, it is pulled low by an internal 50k resistor and Burst Mode operation is enabled. If this pin is taken above 2V or an external clock is applied, Burst Mode operation is disabled and the IC operates in continuous mode. With no load (or an extremely light load), the controller will skip pulses in order to maintain regulation and prevent excessive output ripple.\nThe RUN pin controls whether the IC is enabled or is in a low \ncurrent shutdown state. A micropower 1.248V reference and comparator C2 allow the user to program the supply voltage at which the IC turns on and off (comparator C2 has 100mV of hysteresis for noise immunity). With the RUN pin below 1.248V , the chip is off and the input supply current is typically only 10μA.\nAn overvoltage comparator OV senses when the FB pin \nexceeds the reference voltage by 6.5% and provides a \nLTC1871\n101871feMOSFET R DS(ON) . If the I TH pin drops below 0.30V , the \nBurst Mode comparator B1 will turn off the power MOSFET and scale back the quiescent current of the IC to 250μA (sleep mode). In this condition, the load current will be supplied by the output capacitor until the I\nTH voltage rises \nabove the 50mV hysteresis of the burst comparator . At light loads, short bursts of switching (where the average inductor current is 20% of its maximum value) followed by long periods of sleep will be observed, thereby greatly improving converter efﬁ  ciency. Oscilloscope waveforms \nillustrating Burst Mode operation are shown in Figure 3.\nPulse-Skip Mode Operation\nWith the MODE/SYNC pin tied to a DC voltage above 2V , \nBurst Mode operation is disabled. The internal, 0.525V buffered I\nTH burst clamp is removed, allowing the I TH \npin to directly control the current comparator from no load to full load. With no load, the I\nTH pin is driven below \n0.30V , the power MOSFET is turned off and sleep mode is invoked. Oscilloscope waveforms illustrating this mode of operation are shown in Figure 4.When an external clock signal drives the MODE/SYNC \npin at a rate faster than the chip’s internal oscillator , the oscillator will synchronize to it. In this synchronized mode, Burst Mode operation is disabled. The constant frequency associated with synchronized operation provides a more controlled noise spectrum from the converter , at the ex-pense of overall system efﬁ  ciency of light loads.\nWhen the oscillator’s internal logic circuitry detects a \nsynchronizing signal on the MODE/SYNC pin, the in-ternal oscillator ramp is terminated early and the slope compensation is increased by approximately 30%. As a result, in applications requiring synchronization, it is recommended that the nominal operating frequency of the IC be programmed to be about 75% of the external clock frequency. Attempting to synchronize to too high an external frequency (above 1.3f\nO) can result in inadequate \nslope compensation and possible subharmonic oscillation (or jitter).\nThe external clock signal must exceed 2V for at least 25ns, \nand should have a maximum duty cycle of 80%, as shown in Figure 5. The MOSFET turn on will synchronize to the rising edge of the external clock signal.\nFigure 3. L TC1871 Burst Mode Operation \n(MODE/SYNC = 0V) at Low Output Current\nFigure 4.

Low \nfrequency operation improves efﬁ  ciency by reducing MOSFET and diode switching losses. However , lower frequency operation requires more inductance for a given amount of load current.\nThe L TC1871 uses a constant frequency architecture that \ncan be programmed over a 50kHz to 1000kHz range with a single external resistor from the FREQ pin to ground, as shown in Figure 1. The nominal voltage on the FREQ pin is 0.6V , and the current that ﬂ  ows into the FREQ pin is used \nto charge and discharge an internal oscillator capacitor . A graph for selecting the value of R\nT for a given operating \nfrequency is shown in Figure 6.INTV CC Regulator Bypassing and Operation\nAn internal, P-channel low dropout voltage regulator pro-\nduces the 5.2V supply which powers the gate driver and logic circuitry within the L TC1871, as shown in Figure 7. The INTV\nCC regulator can supply up to 50mA and must be \nbypassed to ground immediately adjacent to the IC pins with a minimum of 4.7μF tantalum or ceramic capacitor . Good bypassing is necessary to supply the high transient currents required by the MOSFET gate driver .\nFor input voltages that don’t exceed 7V (the absolute \nmaximum rating for this pin), the internal low dropout regulator in the L TC1871 is redundant and the INTV\nCC pin \ncan be shorted directly to the V IN pin. With the INTV CC \npin shorted to V IN, however , the divider that programs the \nregulated INTV CC voltage will draw 10μA of current from \nthe input supply, even in shutdown mode. For applications that require the lowest shutdown mode input supply cur-rent, do not connect the INTV\nCC pin to V IN. Regardless of \nwhether the INTV CC pin is shorted to V IN or not, it is always \nnecessary to have the driver circuitry bypassed with a 4.7μF tantalum or low ESR ceramic capacitor to ground immediately adjacent to the INTV\nCC and GND pins.\nIn an actual application, most of the IC supply current is used to drive the gate capacitance of the power MOSFET . As a result, high input voltage applications in which a large power MOSFET is being driven at high frequencies can cause the L TC1871 to exceed its maximum junction \nFigure 6.

The junction temperature can be \nestimated using the following equations:\n IQ(TOT)  ≈ IQ + f • Q G\n P IC = V IN • (IQ + f • Q G)\n T J = TA + P IC • RTH(JA)  \nThe total quiescent current I Q(TOT)  consists of the static \nsupply current (I Q) and the current required to charge and \ndischarge the gate of the power MOSFET . The 10-pin MSOP package has a thermal resistance of R\nTH(JA)  = 120°C/W .\nAs an example, consider a power supply with V IN = 5V and \nVO = 12V at I O = 1A. The switching frequency is 500kHz, \nand the maximum ambient temperature is 70°C. The power MOSFET chosen is the IRF7805, which has a maximum R\nDS(ON)  of 11mΩ (at room temperature) and a maximum \ntotal gate charge of 37nC (the temperature coefﬁ  cient of \nthe gate charge is low).\n IQ(TOT)  = 600μA + 37nC • 500kHz = 19.1mA\n P IC = 5V • 19.1mA = 95mW\n T J = 70°C + 120°C/W • 95mW = 81.4°C\nThis demonstrates how signiﬁ  cant the gate charge current \ncan be when compared to the static quiescent current in the IC.\nTo prevent the maximum junction temperature from being \nexceeded, the input supply current must be checked when operating in a continuous mode at high V\nIN. A tradeoff \nbetween the operating frequency and the size of the power MOSFET may need to be made in order to maintain a reliable IC junction temperature. Prior to lowering the operating frequency, however , be sure to check with power MOSFET manufacturers for their latest-and-greatest low Q\nG, low \nRDS(ON)  devices. Power MOSFET manufacturing tech-\nnologies are continually improving, with newer and better performance devices being introduced almost yearly.\nOutput Voltage Programming\nThe output voltage is set by a resistor divider according \nto the following formula:\n VO=1.230V \x81 1 +R2\nR1\x01\n\x03\x02\x04\n\x06\x05The external resistor divider is connected to the output \nas shown in Figure 1, allowing remote voltage sensing. The resistors R1 and R2 are typically chosen so that the error caused by the current ﬂ  owing into the FB pin dur-\ning normal operation is less than 1% (this translates to a maximum value of R1 of about 250k).\nProgramming Turn-On and Turn-Off Thresholds with \nthe RUN Pin\nThe L TC1871 contains an independent, micropower voltage \nreference and comparator detection circuit that remains active even when the device is shut down, as shown in Figure 8. This allows users to accurately program an input voltage at which the converter will turn on and off. The falling threshold voltage on the RUN pin is equal to the internal reference voltage of 1.248V . The comparator has 100mV of hysteresis to increase noise immunity.\nThe turn-on and turn-off input voltage thresholds are \nprogrammed using a resistor divider according to the \nfollowing formulas:\n \nVIN(OFF) =1.248V \x81 1 +R2\nR1\x01\n\x03\x02\x04\n\x06\x05\nVIN(ON) =1.348V \x81 1 +R2\nR1\x01\n\x03\x02\x04\n\x06\x05\nThe resistor R1 is typically chosen to be less than 1M.\nFor applications where the RUN pin is only to be used as \na logic input, the user should be aware of the 7V Absolute Maximum Rating for this pin!  The RUN pin can be con-\nnected to the input voltage through an external 1M resistor , \nas shown in Figure 8c, for “always on” operation.\nApplication Circuits\nA basic L TC1871 application circuit is shown in Figure 1. \nExternal component selection is driven by the character-istics of the load and the input supply. The ﬁ  rst topology \nto be analyzed will be the boost converter , followed by SEPIC (single ended primary inductance converter).\nLTC1871\n131871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 8a. Programming the Turn-On and Turn-Off Thresholds Using the RUN Pin\nBoost Converter: Duty Cycle Considerations\nFor a boost converter operating in a continuous conduction \nmode (CCM), the duty cycle of the main switch is:\n D=VO+VD–VIN\nVO+VD\x01\n\x03\x02\x04\n\x06\x05\nwhere V D is the forward voltage of the boost diode. For \nconverters where the input voltage is close to the output voltage, the duty cycle is low and for converters that develop a high output voltage from a low voltage input supply, the duty cycle is high. The maximum output voltage for a boost converter operating in CCM is:\n \nVO(MAX) =VIN(MIN)\n1–DMAX ( )–VD\nThe maximum duty cycle capability of the L TC1871 is \ntypically 92%. This allows the user to obtain high output voltages from low input supply voltages.Boost Converter: The Peak and Average Input Currents\nThe control circuit in the L TC1871 is measuring the input \ncurrent (either by using the R\nDS(ON)  of the power MOSFET \nor by using a sense resistor in the MOSFET source), so the output current needs to be reﬂ  ected back to the input \nin order to dimension the power MOSFET properly. Based on the fact that, ideally, the output power is equal to the input power , the maximum average input current is:\nIIN(MAX) =IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX\nThe peak input current is:\nIIN(PEAK) =1+\x01\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX\nThe maximum duty cycle, D MAX, should be calculated at \nminimum V IN.

For example, if 30% ripple current is chosen, then \nχ = 0.30, and the peak current is \n15% greater than the average. \nFor a current mode boost regulator operating in CCM, \nslope compensation must be added for duty cycles above 50% in order to avoid subharmonic oscillation. For the L TC1871, this ramp compensation is internal. Having an internally ﬁ  xed ramp compensation waveform, however , \ndoes place some constraints on the value of the inductor and the operating frequency. If too large an inductor is used, the resulting current ramp ( ΔI\nL) will be small relative \nto the internal ramp compensation (at duty cycles above 50%), and the converter operation will approach voltage mode (ramp compensation reduces the gain of the current loop). If too small an inductor is used, but the converter is still operating in CCM (near critical conduction mode), the internal ramp compensation may be inadequate to prevent subharmonic oscillation. To ensure good current mode gain and avoid subharmonic oscillation, it is recom-mended that the ripple current in the inductor fall in the range of 20% to 40% of the maximum average current. For example, if the maximum average input current is 1A, choose a ΔI\nL between 0.2A and 0.4A, and a value ‘χ’ \nbetween 0.2 and 0.4.\nBoost Converter: Inductor Selection\nGiven an operating input voltage range, and having chosen \nthe operating frequency and ripple current in the inductor , the inductor value can be determined using the following equation:\nL=VIN(MIN)\n\x01IL\x81f\x81DMAX\nwhere:\n\x01IL=\x02\x81IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX\nRemember that boost converters are not short-circuit \nprotected. Under a shorted output condition, the inductor current is limited only by the input supply capability. For applications requiring a step-up converter that is short-\ncircuit protected, please refer to the applications section covering SEPIC converters. \nThe minimum required saturation current of the inductor \ncan be expressed as a function of the duty cycle and the load current, as follows:\n \nIL(SAT)\x021+\x01\n2\x03\n\x05\x04\x06\n\x08\x07\x81IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX\nThe saturation current rating for the inductor should be \nchecked at the minimum input voltage (which results in the highest inductor current) and maximum output current. \nBoost Converter: Operating in Discontinuous Mode\nDiscontinuous mode operation occurs when the load cur-\nrent is low enough to allow the inductor current to run out during the off-time of the switch, as shown in Figure 9. Once the inductor current is near zero, the switch and diode capacitances resonate with the inductance to form damped ringing at 1MHz to 10MHz. If the off-time is long enough, the drain voltage will settle to the input voltage. \nDepending on the input voltage and the residual energy \nin the inductor , this ringing can cause the drain of the power MOSFET to go below ground where it is clamped by the body diode. This ringing is not harmful to the IC and it has not been shown to contribute signiﬁ  cantly to EMI. Any attempt to damp it with a snubber will degrade the efﬁ  ciency.\nFigure 9.

High efﬁ  ciency converters generally cannot \nafford the core loss found in low cost powdered iron cores, forcing the use of more expensive ferrite, molypermalloy or Kool Mμ\n® cores. Actual core loss is independent of core \nsize for a ﬁ  xed inductor value, but is very dependent on \nthe inductance selected. As inductance increases, core losses go down. Unfortunately, increased inductance requires more turns of wire and therefore, copper losses will increase. Generally, there is a tradeoff between core losses and copper losses that needs to be balanced.\nFerrite designs have very low core losses and are pre-\nferred at high switching frequencies, so design goals can concentrate on copper losses and preventing saturation. Ferrite core material saturates “hard,” meaning that the inductance collapses rapidly when the peak design current is exceeded. This results in an abrupt increase in inductor ripple current and consequently, output voltage ripple. Do \nnot allow the core to saturate!\nMolypermalloy (from Magnetics, Inc.) is a very good, \nlow cost core material for toroids, but is more expensive than ferrite. A reasonable compromise from the same manufacturer is Kool Mμ. \nBoost Converter: Power MOSFET Selection\nThe power MOSFET serves two purposes in the L TC1871: \nit represents the main switching element in the power path, and its R\nDS(ON) represents the current sensing element \nfor the control loop. Important parameters for the power MOSFET include the drain-to-source breakdown voltage (BV\nDSS), the threshold voltage (V GS(TH) ), the on-resistance \n(RDS(ON) ) versus gate-to-source voltage, the gate-to-source \nand gate-to-drain charges (Q GS and Q GD, respectively), \nthe maximum drain current (I D(MAX) ) and the MOSFET’s \nthermal resistances (R TH(JC)  and R TH(JA) ).\nThe gate drive voltage is set by the 5.2V INTV CC low drop \nregulator . Consequently, logic-level threshold MOSFETs should be used in most L TC1871 applications. If low input voltage operation is expected (e.g., supplying power from a lithium-ion battery or a 3.3V logic supply), then sublogic-level threshold MOSFETs should be used. Pay close attention to the BV\nDSS speciﬁ  cations for the \nMOSFETs relative to the maximum actual switch voltage in the application. Many logic-level devices are limited to 30V or less, and the switch node can ring during the turn-off of the MOSFET due to layout parasitics. Check the switching waveforms of the MOSFET directly across the drain and source terminals using the actual PC board layout (not just on a lab breadboard!) for excessive ringing.\nDuring the switch on-time, the control circuit limits the \nmaximum voltage drop across the power MOSFET to about 150mV (at low duty cycle). The peak inductor current is therefore limited to 150mV/R\nDS(ON) . The relationship \nbetween the maximum load current, duty cycle and the R\nDS(ON)  of the power MOSFET is:\n RDS(ON)\x03VSENSE(MAX) \x811–DMAX\n1+\x01\n2\x04\n\x06\x05\x07\n\t\x08\x81IO(MAX) \x81\x02T\nThe V SENSE(MAX) term is typically 150mV at low duty \ncycle, and is reduced to about 100mV at a duty cycle of 92% due to slope compensation, as shown in Figure 10. The ρ\nT term accounts for the temperature coefﬁ  cient of \nthe R DS(ON)  of the MOSFET , which is typically 0.4%/°C. \nFigure 11 illustrates the variation of normalized R DS(ON)  \nover tempera ture for a typical power MOSFET .\nDUTY CYCLE0MAXIMUM CURRENT SENSE VOLTAGE (mV)100150\n0.8\n1871 F1050\n0\n0.2 0.4 0.5 1.0200\nFigure 10.

This should be taken into consideration in applications where it is important to limit the maximum current drawn from the input supply.\nCalculating Power MOSFET Switching and Conduction \nLosses and Junction Temperatures\nIn order to calculate the junction temperature of the power MOSFET , the power dissipated by the device must be known. This power dissipation is a function of the duty cycle, the load current and the junction temperature itself (due to the positive temperature coefﬁ  cient of its \nR\nDS(ON) ). As a result, some iterative calculation is normally \nrequired to determine a reasonably accurate value. Since the con\ntroller is using the MOSFET as both a switching \nand a sensing element, care should be taken to ensure that the converter is capable of delivering the required load current over all operating conditions (line voltage and temperature), and for the worst-case speciﬁ  cations \nfor V\nSENSE(MAX)  and the R DS(ON)  of the MOSFET listed in \nthe manufacturer’s data sheet.The power dissipated by the MOSFET in a boost converter is:\n PFET=IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x062\n\x81RDS(ON) \x81DMAX\x81\x01T\n+k\x81VO1.85\x81IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX ( )\x81CRSS\x81f\nThe ﬁ  rst term in the equation above represents the I2R \nlosses in the device, and the second term, the switching losses. The constant, k = 1.7, is an empirical factor inversely related to the gate drive current and has the dimension of 1/current.\nFrom a known power dissipated in the power MOSFET , its \njunction temperature can be obtained using the following formula:\n T\nJ = TA + P FET • RTH(JA)\nThe R TH(JA)  to be used in this equation normally includes \nthe R TH(JC)  for the device plus the thermal resistance from \nthe case to the ambient temperature (R TH(CA) ). This value \nof TJ can then be compared to the original, assumed value \nused in the iterative calculation process.\nBoost Converter: Output Diode Selection\nTo maximize efﬁ  ciency, a fast switching diode with low \nforward drop and low reverse leakage is desired. The output diode in a boost converter conducts current during the switch off-time. The peak reverse voltage that the diode must withstand is equal to the regulator output voltage. The average forward current in normal operation is equal to the output current, and the peak current is equal to the peak inductor current.\n \nID(PEAK) =IL(PEAK) =1+\x01\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX\nThe power dissipated by the diode is:\n P D = IO(MAX)  • VD\nand the diode junction temperature is: T\nJ = TA + P D • RTH(JA)\nThe R TH(JA)  to be used in this equation normally includes \nthe R TH(JC)  for the device plus the thermal resistance from \nthe board to the ambient temperature in the enclosure. \nLTC1871\n171871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nRemember to keep the diode lead lengths short and to \nobserve proper switch-node layout (see Board Layout Checklist) to avoid excessive ringing and increased dis-sipation.\nBoost Converter: Output Capacitor Selection\nContributions of ESR (equivalent series resistance), ESL \n(equivalent series inductance) and the bulk capacitance must be considered when choosing the correct component for a given output ripple voltage. The effects of these three parameters (ESR, ESL and bulk C) on the output voltage ripple waveform are illustrated in Figure 12e for a typical boost converter .\nThe choice of component(s) begins with the maximum acceptable ripple voltage (expressed as a percentage of the output voltage), and how this ripple should be divided between the ESR step and the charging/discharging ΔV.  \nFor the purpose of simplicity we will choose 2% for the maximum output ripple, to be divided equally between the ESR step and the charging/discharging ΔV . This percent-\nage ripple will change, depending on the requirements of the application, and the equations provided below can easily be modiﬁ  ed.\nFor a 1% contribution to the total ripple voltage, the ESR of the output capacitor can be determined using the fol-lowing equation:\n \nESRCOUT\x010.01\x81 VO\nIIN(PEAK )\nwhere:\n IIN(PEAK) =1+\x01\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX\nFor the bulk C component, which also contributes 1% to \nthe total ripple:\n COUT\x01IO(MAX)\n0.01\x81 VO\x81f\nFor many designs it is possible to choose a single capacitor \ntype that satisﬁ  es both the ESR and bulk C requirements \nfor the design. In certain demanding applications, however , the ripple voltage can be improved signiﬁ  cantly by con-necting two or more types of capacitors in parallel. For \nexample, using a low ESR ceramic capacitor can minimize the ESR step, while an electrolytic capacitor can be used to supply the required bulk C.\nOnce the output capacitor ESR and bulk capacitance have \nbeen determined, the overall ripple voltage waveform should be veriﬁ  ed on a dedicated PC board (see Board \nLayout section for more information on component place-ment). Lab breadboards generally suffer from excessive series inductance (due to inter-component wiring), and these parasitics can make the switching waveforms look signiﬁ  cantly worse than they would be on a properly designed PC board.\nThe output capacitor in a boost regulator experiences high \nRMS ripple currents, as shown in Figure 12. The RMS output capacitor ripple current is:\n \nIRMS(COUT) \x01IO(MAX) \x81VO–VIN(MIN)\nVIN(MIN ) \nNote that the ripple current ratings from capacitor manu-\nfacturers are often based on only 2000 hours of life. This makes it advisable to further derate the capacitor or to choose a capacitor rated at a higher temperature than required. Several capacitors may also be placed in parallel to meet size or height requirements in the design.\nManufacturers such as Nichicon, United Chemicon and \nSanyo should be considered for high performance through-hole capacitors. The OS-CON semiconductor dielectric capacitor available from Sanyo has the lowest product of ESR and size of any aluminum electrolytic, at a somewhat higher price.\nIn surface mount applications, multiple capacitors may \nhave to be placed in parallel in order to meet the ESR or RMS current handling requirements of the application. Aluminum electrolytic and dry tantalum capacitors are both available in surface mount packages. In the case of tantalum, it is critical that the capacitors have been surge tested for use in switching power supplies. An excellent choice is AVX TPS series of surface mount tantalum. Also, ceramic capacitors are now available with extremely low ESR, ESL and high ripple current ratings.\nLTC1871\n181871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nBoost Converter: Input Capacitor Selection\nThe input capacitor of a boost converter is less critical \nthan the output capacitor , due to the fact that the inductor is in series with the input and the input current waveform is continuous (see Figure 12b). The input voltage source impedance determines the size of the input capacitor , which is typically in the range of 10μF to 100μF . A low ESR capacitor is recommended, although it is not as critical as for the output capacitor .\nThe RMS input capacitor ripple current for a boost con-\nverter is:\n \nIRMS(CIN) =0.3 \x81VIN(MIN)\nL\x81f\x81DMAX Please note that the input capacitor can see a very high \nsurge current when a battery is suddenly connected to the input of the converter and solid tantalum capacitors can fail catastrophically under these conditions. Be sure \nto specify surge-tested capacitors!\nBurst Mode Operation and Considerations\nThe choice of MOSFET R\nDS(ON)  and inductor value also \ndetermines the load current at which the L TC1871 enters Burst Mode operation. When bursting, the controller clamps the peak inductor current to approximately:\n \nIBURST(PEAK) =30mV\nRDS(ON )\nwhich represents about 20% of the maximum 150mV \nSENSE pin voltage. The corresponding average current depends upon the amount of ripple current. Lower inductor values (higher ΔI\nL) will reduce the load current at which \nBurst Mode operations begins, since it is the peak current that is being clamped.\nThe output voltage ripple can increase during Burst Mode \noperation if ΔI\nL is substantially less than I BURST . This can \noccur if the input voltage is very low or if a very large inductor is chosen. At high duty cycles, a skipped cycle causes the inductor current to quickly decay to zero. However , because ΔI\nL is small, it takes multiple cycles \nfor the current to ramp back up to I BURST(PEAK) . Dur-\ning this inductor charging interval, the output capacitor must supply the load current and a signiﬁ  cant droop in \nthe output voltage can occur . Generally, it is a good idea to choose a value of inductor ΔI\nL between 25% and 40% \nof IIN(MAX) . The alternative is to either increase the value \nof the output capacitor or disable Burst Mode operation using the MODE/SYNC pin.\nBurst Mode operation can be defeated by connecting the \nMODE/SYNC pin to a high logic-level voltage (either with a control input or by connecting this pin to INTV\nCC). In \nthis mode, the burst clamp is removed, and the chip can operate at constant frequency from continuous conduction mode (CCM) at full load, down into deep discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) at light load. Prior to skipping pulses at very light load (i.e., <5% of full load), the control-ler will operate with a minimum switch on-time in DCM. VINLD\nSW\n12a. Circuit Diagram\n12b.

Percent \nefﬁ  ciency can be expressed as:\n % Efﬁ  ciency = 100% – (L1 + L2 + L3 + …),where L1, L2, etc. are the individual loss components as a \npercentage of the input power . It is often useful to analyze individual losses to determine what is limiting the efﬁ  ciency and which change would produce the most improvement. \nAlthough all dissipative elements in the circuit produce losses, four main sources usually account for the majority of the losses in L TC1871 application circuits:\n1. The supply current into V\nIN. The V IN current is the sum \nof the DC supply current I Q (given in the Electrical Char-\nacteristics) and the MOSFET driver and control currents. The DC supply current into the V\nIN pin is typically about \n550μA and represents a small power loss (much less than 1%) that increases with V\nIN. The driver current \nresults from switching the gate capacitance of the power MOSFET ; this current is typically much larger than the DC current. Each time the MOSFET is switched on and \nLTC1871\n201871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nthen off, a packet of gate charge Q G is transferred from \nINTV CC to ground. The resulting dQ/dt is a current that \nmust be supplied to the INTV CC capacitor through the \nVIN pin by an external supply. If the IC is operating in \nCCM:\n  I Q(TOT)  ≈ IQ = f • Q G\n  P IC = V IN • (IQ + f • Q G)\n2. Power MOSFET switching and conduction losses. The \ntechnique of using the voltage drop across the power MOSFET to close the current feedback loop was chosen because of the increased efﬁ  ciency that results from \nnot having a sense resistor . The losses in the power MOSFET are equal to:\n  PFET=IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x062\n\x81RDS(ON) \x81DMAX\x81\x01T\n+k\x81VO1.85\x81IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX ( )\x81CRSS\x81f\n The I2R power savings that result from not having a \ndiscrete sense resistor can be calculated almost by inspection.\n  PR(SENSE) =IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX\x01\n\x03\x02\x04\n\x06\x052\n\x81RSENSE \x81DMAX\n To understand the magnitude of the improvement with \nthis V DS sensing technique, consider the 3.3V input, \n5V output power supply shown in Figure 1. The maxi-mum load current is 7A (10A peak) and the duty cycle is 39%. Assuming a ripple current of 40%, the peak inductor current is 13.8A and the average is 11.5A. With a maximum sense voltage of about 140mV , the sense resistor value would be 10mΩ, and the power dissipated in this resistor would be 514mW at maxi-mum output current. Assuming an efﬁ  ciency of 90%, \nthis sense resistor power dissipation represents 1.3% of the overall input power . In other words, for this ap-plication, the use of V\nDS sensing would increase the \nefﬁ  ciency by approximately 1.3%.\n For more details regarding the various terms in these \nequations, please refer to the section Boost Converter: Power MOSFET Selection.3. The losses in the inductor are simply the DC input cur-\nrent squared times the winding resistance. Expressing this loss as a function of the output current yields:\n  \nPR(WINDING) =IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX\x01\n\x03\x02\x04\n\x06\x052\n\x81RW\n4. Losses in the boost diode. The power dissipation in the \nboost diode is:\n  P DIODE  = IO(MAX)  • VD\n The boost diode can be a major source of power loss \nin a boost converter . For the 3.3V input, 5V output at \n7A example given above, a Schottky diode with a 0.4V forward voltage would dissipate 2.8W , which represents 7% of the input power . Diode losses can become signiﬁ  -cant at low output voltages where the forward voltage is a signiﬁ  cant percentage of the output voltage. \n5. Other losses, including C\nIN and C O ESR dissipation and \ninductor core losses, generally account for less than 2% of the total additional loss.\nChecking T ransient Response\nThe regulator loop response can be veriﬁ  ed by looking at \nthe load transient response. Switching regulators generally take several cycles to respond to an instantaneous step in resistive load current. When the load step occurs, V\nO \nimmediately shifts by an amount equal to ( ΔILOAD)(ESR), \nand then C O begins to charge or discharge (depending on \nthe direction of the load step) as shown in Figure 13. The regulator feedback loop acts on the resulting error amp output signal to return V\nO to its steady-state value. During \nthis recovery time, V O can be monitored for overshoot or \nringing that would indicate a stability problem.\nFigure 13.

The discharged bypass capacitors are effectively put in parallel with C\nO, causing a nearly instantaneous drop in \nVO. No regulator can deliver enough current to prevent \nthis problem if the load switch resistance is low and it is driven quickly. The only solution is to limit the rise time of the switch drive in order to limit the inrush current di/dt to the load.\nBoost Converter Design Example\nThe design example given here will be for the circuit shown \nin Figure 1. The input voltage is 3.3V , and the output is 5V at a maximum load current of 7A (10A peak).\n1. The duty cycle is:\n \nD=VO+VD–VIN\nVO+VD\x01\n\x03\x02\x04\n\x06\x05=5+0.4 – 3.3\n5+0.4=38.9%\n2. Pulse-skip operation is chosen so the MODE/SYNC pin \nis shorted to INTV CC.\n3. The operating frequency is chosen to be 300kHz to \nreduce the size of the inductor . From Figure 5, the resistor from the FREQ pin to ground is 80k.\n4. An inductor ripple current of 40% of the maximum load \ncurrent is chosen, so the peak input current (which is also the minimum saturation current) is:\n \nIIN(PEAK) =1+\x01\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX=1.2 \x817\n1– 0. 39=13.8A\n The inductor ripple current is:\n \x01IL=\x02\x81IO(MAX)\n1–DMAX=0.4 \x817\n1–0.39=4.6A\n And so the inductor value is:\n L=VIN(MIN)\n\x01IL\x81f\x81DMAX=3.3V\n4.6A \x81 300kH z\x81 0.39 =0.93μH\n The component chosen is a 1μH inductor made by \nSumida (part number CEP125-H 1ROMH) which has a saturation current of greater than 20A.\n5. With the input voltage to the IC bootstrapped to the \noutput of the power supply (5V), a logic-level MOSFET can be used. Because the duty cycle is 39%, the maxi-\nmum SENSE pin threshold voltage is reduced from its low duty cycle typical value of 150mV to approximately 140mV . Assuming a MOSFET junction temperature of 125°C, the room temperature MOSFET R\nDS(ON)  should \nbe less than:\n RDS(ON)\x04VSENSE(MAX) \x811–DMAX\n1+\x02\n2\x05\n\x07\x06\x08\n\n\t\x81IO(MAX) \x81\x03T\n=0.140V \x811– 0.39\n1+0.4\n2\x05\n\x07\x06\x08\n\n\t\x817A\x81 1.5=6.8m\x01\n The MOSFET used was the Fairchild FDS7760A, which \nhas a maximum R DS(ON)  of 8mΩ at 4.5V V GS, a BV DSS \nof greater than 30V , and a gate charge of 37nC at 5V V\nGS.\n6. The diode for this design must handle a maximum \nDC output current of 10A and be rated for a minimum reverse voltage of V\nOUT, or 5V . A 25A, 15V diode from \nOn Semiconductor (MBRB2515L) was chosen for its high power dissipation capability.\n7. The output capacitor usually consists of a high valued \nbulk C connected in parallel with a lower valued, low ESR ceramic. Based on a maximum output ripple voltage of 1%, or 50mV , the bulk C needs to be greater than:\n COUT\x01IOUT(MAX)\n0.01\x81 VOUT\x81f=\n7A\n0.01\x81 5V \x81 300kH z=466μF\n \n The RMS ripple current rating for this capacitor needs \nto exceed:\n \n IRMS(COUT) \x01IO(MAX) \x81VO–VIN(MIN)\nVIN(MIN )=\n7A \x815V – 3.3V\n3.3V=5A\n To satisfy this high RMS current demand, four \n150μF Panasonic capacitors (EEFUEOJ151R) are required.  In parallel with these bulk capacitors, two 22μF , low ESR (X5R) Taiyo Yuden ceramic capacitors \nLTC1871\n221871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n(JMK325BJ226MM) are added for HF noise reduction.  \nCheck the output ripple with a single oscilloscope probe connected directly across the output capacitor terminals, where the HF switching currents ﬂ  ow.\n8. The choice of an input capacitor for a boost converter \ndepends on the impedance of the source supply and the amount of input ripple the converter will safely tol-erate. For this particular design and lab setup a 100μF Sanyo Poscap (6TPC 100M), in parallel with two 22μF Taiyo Yuden ceramic capacitors (JMK325BJ226MM) is required (the input and return lead lengths are kept to a few inches, but the peak input current is close to 20A!). As with the output node, check the input ripple with a single oscilloscope probe connected across the input capacitor terminals.\nPC Board Layout Checklist\n1. In order to minimize switching noise and improve output \nload regulation, the GND pin of the L TC1871 should be connected directly to 1) the negative terminal of the INTV\nCC decoupling capacitor , 2) the negative terminal \nof the output decoupling capacitors, 3) the source of \nthe power MOSFET or the bottom terminal of the sense resistor , 4) the negative terminal of the input capacitor and 5) at least one via to the ground plane immediately adjacent to Pin 6. The ground trace on the top layer of the PC board should be as wide and short as possible to minimize series resistance and inductance.\n2. Beware of ground loops in multiple layer PC boards. \nT ry to maintain one central ground node on the board and use the input capacitor to avoid excess input ripple for high output current power supplies. If the ground plane is to be used for high DC currents, choose a path away from the small-signal components.\n3. Place the C\nVCC capacitor immediately adjacent to the \nINTV CC and GND pins on the IC package. This capaci-\ntor carries high di/dt MOSFET gate drive currents. A low ESR and ESL 4.7μF ceramic capacitor works well here.\n4. The high di/dt loop from the bottom terminal of the \noutput capacitor , through the power MOSFET , through the boost diode and back through the output capacitors should be kept as tight as possible to reduce inductive \nringing. Excess inductance can cause increased stress on the power MOSFET and increase HF noise on the output. If low ESR ceramic capacitors are used on the output to reduce output noise, place these capacitors close to the boost diode in order to keep the series inductance to a minimum.\n5. Check the stress on the power MOSFET by measuring \nits drain-to-source voltage directly across the device terminals (reference the ground of a single scope probe directly to the source pad on the PC board). Beware of inductive ringing which can exceed the maximum speciﬁ  ed voltage rating of the MOSFET . If this ringing cannot be avoided and exceeds the maximum rating of the device, either choose a higher voltage device or specify an avalanche-rated power MOSFET . Not all MOSFETs are created equal (some are more equal than others).\n6. Place the small-signal components away from high \nfrequency switching nodes. In the layout shown in Figure 14, all of the small-signal components have been placed on one side of the IC and all of the power components have been placed on the other . This also allows the use of a pseudo-Kelvin connection for the signal ground, where high di/dt gate driver currents ﬂ  ow out of the IC ground pin in one direction (to the bottom plate of the INTV\nCC decoupling capacitor) and \nsmall-signal currents ﬂ  ow in the other direction.\n7. If a sense resistor is used in the source of the power \nMOSFET , minimize the capacitance between the SENSE pin trace and any high frequency switching nodes. The L TC1871 contains an internal leading edge blanking time of approximately 180ns, which should be adequate for most applications.\n8. For optimum load regulation and true remote sensing, \nthe top of the output resistor divider should connect independently to the top of the output capacitor (Kelvin connection), staying away from any high dV/dt traces. Place the divider resistors near the L TC1871 in order to keep the high impedance FB node short.\n9. For applications with multiple switching power convert-\ners connected to the same input supply, make sure \nLTC1871\n231871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 14.

AC input current from another converter could cause substantial input voltage ripple, and this could interfere with the operation of the L TC1871. A few inches of PC trace or wire (L ≈ 100nH) between the C\nIN of the L TC1871 and the actual source \nVIN should be sufﬁ  cient to prevent current sharing \nproblems.\nSEPIC Converter Applications\nThe L TC1871 is also well suited to SEPIC (single-ended \nprimary inductance converter) converter applications.  The SEPIC converter shown in Figure 16 uses two inductors. The advantage of the SEPIC converter is the input voltage may be higher or lower than the output voltage, and the output is short-circuit protected.\nFigures 16.

Current Flow During Switch On-Time\nThe ﬁ  rst inductor , L1, together with the main switch, \nresembles a boost converter . The second inductor , L2, together with the output diode D1, resembles a ﬂ  yback or \nbuck-boost converter . The two inductors L1 and L2 can be independent but can also be wound on the same core since identical voltages are applied to L1 and L2 throughout the switching cycle. By making L1 = L2 and winding them on the same core the input ripple is reduced along with cost and size. All of the SEPIC applications information that \nfollows assumes L1 = L2 = L.\nSEPIC Converter: Duty Cycle Considerations\nFor a SEPIC converter operating in a continuous conduction \nmode (CCM), the duty cycle of the main switch is:\n \nD=VO+VD\nVIN+VO+VD\x01\n\x03\x02\x04\n\x06\x05\nwhere V D is the forward voltage of the diode. For convert-\ners where the input voltage is close to the output voltage the duty cycle is near 50%. \nThe maximum output voltage for a SEPIC converter is:\n VO(MAX) =VIN+VD ()DMAX\n1–DMAX–VD1\n1–DMAX\nThe maximum duty cycle of the L TC1871 is typically \n92%. \nSEPIC Converter: The Peak and Average Input \nCurrents\nThe control circuit in the L TC1871 is measuring the input \ncurrent (either using the R DS(ON)  of the power MOSFET \nor by means of a sense resistor in the MOSFET source), so the output current needs to be reﬂ  ected back to the \ninput in order to dimension the power MOSFET properly. Based on the fact that, ideally, the output power is equal to the input power , the maximum input current for a SEPIC converter is:\nIIN(MAX) =IO(MAX) \x81DMAX\n1–DMAX\nThe peak input current is:\nIIN(PEAK) =1+\x01\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81IO(MAX) \x81DMAX\n1–DMAX\nThe maximum duty cycle, D MAX, should be calculated at \nminimum V IN.\nThe constant ‘ χ’ represents the fraction of ripple current in \nthe inductor relative to its maximum value. For example, if 30% ripple current is chosen, then χ = 0.30 and the peak \ncurrent is 15% greater than the average.\nLTC1871\n251871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIt is worth noting here that SEPIC converters that operate \nat high duty cycles (i.e., that develop a high output volt-age from a low input voltage) can have very high input currents, relative to the output current. Be sure to check that the maximum load current will not overload the input supply.\nSEPIC Converter: Inductor Selection\nFor most SEPIC applications the equal inductor values \nwill fall in the range of 10μH to 100μH. Higher values will reduce the input ripple voltage and reduce the core loss. Lower inductor values are chosen to reduce physical size and improve transient response.\nLike the boost converter , the input current of the SEPIC \nconverter is calculated at full load current and minimum input voltage. The peak inductor current can be signiﬁ  cantly \nhigher than the output current, especially with smaller in-ductors and lighter loads. The following formulas assume CCM operation and calculate the maximum peak inductor currents at minimum V\nIN:\n IL1 (PEAK) =1+\x01\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81IO(MAX) \x81VO+VD\nVIN(MIN )\nIL2(PEAK) =1+\x01\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81IO(MAX) \x81VIN(MIN) +VD\nVIN(MIN )\nThe ripple current in the inductor is typically 20% to 40% \n(i.e., a range of ‘ χ’ from 0.20 to 0.40) of the maximum \naverage input current occurring at V IN(MIN)  and I O(MAX)  and \nΔIL1 = ΔIL2. Expressing this ripple current as a function of \nthe output current results in the following equations for calculating the inductor value:\nL=VIN(MIN)\n\x01IL\x81f\x81DMAX\nwhere:\n\x01IL=\x02\x81IO(MAX) \x81DMAX\n1–DMAX\nBy making L1 = L2 and winding them on the same core, the value of inductance in the equation above is replace by 2L due to mutual inductance. Doing this maintains the same ripple current and energy storage in the inductors. For example, a Coiltronix CTX10-4 is a 10μH inductor with two \nwindings. With the windings in parallel, 10μH inductance is obtained with a current rating of 4A (the number of turns hasn’t changed, but the wire diameter has doubled). Split-ting the two windings creates two 10μH inductors with a current rating of 2A each. Therefore, substituting 2L yields the following equation for coupled inductors:\n \nL1=L2=VIN(MIN)\n2\x81\x01IL\x81f\x81DMAX\nSpecify the maximum inductor current to safely handle \nIL(PK) speciﬁ  ed in the equation above. The saturation \ncurrent rating for the inductor should be checked at the minimum input voltage (which results in the highest inductor current) and maximum output current.\nSEPIC Converter: Power MOSFET Selection\nThe power MOSFET serves two purposes in the L TC1871: \nit represents the main switching element in the power path, and its R\nDS(ON)  represents the current sensing element \nfor the control loop. Important parameters for the power MOSFET include the drain-to-source breakdown voltage (BV\nDSS), the threshold voltage (V GS(TH) ), the on-resistance \n(RDS(ON) ) versus gate-to-source voltage, the gate-to-source \nand gate-to-drain charges (Q GS and Q GD, respectively), \nthe maximum drain current (I D(MAX) ) and the MOSFET’s \nthermal resistances (R TH(JC)  and R TH(JA) ).\nThe gate drive voltage is set by the 5.2V INTV CC low \ndropout regulator . Consequently, logic-level threshold MOSFETs should be used in most L TC1871 applications. If low input voltage operation is expected (e.g., supplying power from a lithium-ion battery), then sublogic-level threshold MOSFETs should be used.\nThe maximum voltage that the MOSFET switch must \nsustain during the off-time in a SEPIC converter is equal to the sum of the input and output voltages (V\nO + VIN).  \nAs a result, careful attention must be paid to the BV DSS \nspeciﬁ  cations for the MOSFETs relative to the maximum actual switch voltage in the application. Many logic-level devices are limited to 30V or less. Check the switching waveforms directly across the drain and source terminals of the power MOSFET to ensure the V\nDS remains below \nthe maximum rating for the device.\nLTC1871\n261871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nDuring the MOSFET’s on-time, the control circuit limits \nthe maximum voltage drop across the power MOSFET to about 150mV (at low duty cycle). The peak inductor current is therefore limited to 150mV/R\nDS(ON) . The relationship \nbetween the maximum load current, duty cycle and the R\nDS(ON)  of the power MOSFET is:\nRDS(ON)\x03VSENSE(MAX)\nIO(MAX )\x811\n1+\x01\n2\x04\n\x06\x05\x07\n\t\x08\x81\x02T\x811\nVO+VD\nVIN(MIN )\x04\n\x06\x05\x07\n\t\x08+1\nThe V SENSE(MAX)  term is typically 150mV at low duty cycle \nand is reduced to about 100mV at a duty cycle of 92% due to slope compensation, as shown in Figure 8. The constant ‘χ’ in the denominator represents the ripple current in the \ninductors relative to their maximum current. For example, if 30% ripple current is chosen, then χ = 0.30. The ρ\nT term \naccounts for the temperature coefﬁ  cient of the R DS(ON)  of \nthe MOSFET , which is typically 0.4%/°C. Figure 9 illustrates the variation of normalized R\nDS(ON)  over temperature for \na typical power MOSFET .\nAnother method of choosing which power MOSFET to \nuse is to check what the maximum output current is for a given R\nDS(ON)  since MOSFET on-resistances are available \nin discrete values.\nIO(MAX)\x03VSENSE(MAX)\nRDS(ON )\x811\n1+\x01\n2\x04\n\x06\x05\x07\n\t\x08\x81\x02T\x811\nVO+VD\nVIN(MIN )\x04\n\x06\x05\x07\n\t\x08+1\nCalculating Power MOSFET Switching and Conduction Losses and Junction Temperatures\nIn order to calculate the junction temperature of the \npower MOSFET , the power dissipated by the device must be known. This power dissipation is a function of the duty cycle, the load current and the junction temperature itself. As a result, some iterative calculation is normally required to determine a reasonably accurate value. Since the controller is using the MOSFET as both a switching and a sensing element, care should be taken to ensure that the converter is capable of delivering the required load current over all operating conditions (load, line and temperature) and for the worst-case speciﬁ  cations for \nV\nSENSE(MAX)  and the R DS(ON)  of the MOSFET listed in the \nmanufacturer’s data sheet.The power dissipated by the MOSFET in a SEPIC converter \nis:\nPFET=IO(MAX) \x81DMAX\n1–DMAX\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x062\n\x81RDS(ON) \x81DMAX\x81\x01T\n+k\x81 VIN(MIN) +VO ()1.85\x81IO(MAX) \x81DMAX\n1–DMAX\x81CRSS\x81f\nThe ﬁ  rst term in the equation above represents the I2R \nlosses in the device and the second term, the switching losses. The constant k = 1.7 is an empirical factor inversely related to the gate drive current and has the dimension of 1/current.\nFrom a known power dissipated in the power MOSFET , its \njunction temperature can be obtained using the following formula:\n T\nJ = TA + P FET •RTH(JA)\nThe R TH(JA)  to be used in this equation normally includes \nthe R TH(JC)  for the device plus the thermal resistance from \nthe board to the ambient temperature in the enclosure. This value of T\nJ can then be used to check the original \nassumption for the junction temperature in the iterative calculation process.\nSEPIC Converter: Output Diode Selection\nTo maximize efﬁ  ciency, a fast-switching diode with low \nforward drop and low reverse leakage is desired. The output diode in a SEPIC converter conducts current during the switch off-time. The peak reverse voltage that the diode must withstand is equal to V\nIN(MAX)  + V O. The average \nforward current in normal operation is equal to the output current, and the peak current is equal to:\n ID(PEAK) =1+\x01\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81IO(MAX) \x81VO+VD\nVIN(MIN )+1\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\nThe power dissipated by the diode is:\n P D = IO(MAX)  • VD\nand the diode junction temperature is: T\nJ = TA + P D • RTH(JA)\nThe R TH(JA)  to be used in this equation normally includes \nthe R TH(JC)  for the device plus the thermal resistance from \nthe board to the ambient temperature in the enclosure.\nLTC1871\n271871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSEPIC Converter: Output Capacitor Selection\nBecause of the improved performance of today’s electro-\nlytic, tantalum and ceramic capacitors, engineers need to consider the contributions of ESR (equivalent series resistance), ESL (equivalent series inductance) and the bulk capacitance when choosing the correct component for a given output ripple voltage. The effects of these three parameters (ESR, ESL, and bulk C) on the output voltage ripple waveform are illustrated in Figure 17 for a typical coupled-inductor SEPIC converter .The choice of component(s) begins with the maximum \nacceptable ripple voltage (expressed as a percentage of the output voltage), and how this ripple should be divided between the ESR step and the charging/discharging ΔV.  \nFor the purpose of simplicity we will choose 2% for the maximum output ripple, to be divided equally between the ESR step and the charging/discharging ΔV . This percentage \nripple will change, depending on the requirements of the application, and the equations provided below can easily be modiﬁ  ed.\nFor a 1% contribution to the total ripple voltage, the ESR \nof the output capacitor can be determined using the fol-lowing equation:\n \nESRCOUT\x010.01\x81 VO\nID(PEAK )\nwhere:\n ID(PEAK) =1+\x01\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81IO(MAX) \x81VO+VD\nVIN(MIN )+1\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\nFor the bulk C component, which also contributes 1% to \nthe total ripple:\n COUT\x01IO(MAX)\n0.01\x81 VO\x81f\nFor many designs it is possible to choose a single capacitor \ntype that satisﬁ  es both the ESR and bulk C requirements \nfor the design. In certain demanding applications, however , the ripple voltage can be improved signiﬁ  cantly by con-necting two or more types of capacitors in parallel. For example, using a low ESR ceramic capacitor can minimize the ESR step, while an electrolytic or tantalum capacitor can be used to supply the required bulk C.\nOnce the output capacitor ESR and bulk capacitance have \nbeen determined, the overall ripple voltage waveform should be veriﬁ  ed on a dedicated PC board (see Board \nLayout section for more information on component place-ment). Lab breadboards generally suffer from excessive series inductance (due to inter-component wiring), and these parasitics can make the switching waveforms look signiﬁ  cantly worse than they would be on a properly designed PC board.\nFigure 17.

Diode CurrentIOID1\nLTC1871\n281871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe output capacitor in a SEPIC regulator experiences \nhigh RMS ripple currents, as shown in Figure 17. The RMS output capacitor ripple current is:\n  IRMS(COUT) =IO(MAX) \x81VO\nVIN(MIN )\nNote that the ripple current ratings from capacitor manu-\nfacturers are often based on only 2000 hours of life. This makes it advisable to further derate the capacitor or to choose a capacitor rated at a higher temperature than required. Several capacitors may also be placed in parallel to meet size or height requirements in the design.\nManufacturers such as Nichicon, United Chemicon and \nSanyo should be considered for high performance through-hole capacitors. The OS-CON semiconductor dielectric capacitor available from Sanyo has the lowest product of ESR and size of any aluminum electrolytic, at a somewhat higher price.\nIn surface mount applications, multiple capacitors may \nhave to be placed in parallel in order to meet the ESR or RMS current handling requirements of the application. Aluminum electrolytic and dry tantalum capacitors are both available in surface mount packages. In the case of tantalum, it is critical that the capacitors have been surge tested for use in switching power supplies. An excellent choice is AVX TPS series of surface mount tantalum. Also, ceramic capacitors are now available with extremely low ESR, ESL and high ripple current ratings.\nSEPIC Converter: Input Capacitor Selection\nThe input capacitor of a SEPIC converter is less critical \nthan the output capacitor due to the fact that an inductor is in series with the input and the input current waveform is triangular in shape. The input voltage source impedance determines the size of the input capacitor which is typi-cally in the range of 10μF to 100μF . A low ESR capacitor is recommended, although it is not as critical as for the output capacitor .\nThe RMS input capacitor ripple current for a SEPIC con-\nverter is:\n \nIRMS(CIN) =1\n12\x81\x01IL Please note that the input capacitor can see a very high \nsurge current when a battery is suddenly connected to the input of the converter and solid tantalum capacitors can fail catastrophically under these conditions. Be sure \nto specify surge-tested capacitors!\nSEPIC Converter: Selecting the DC Coupling Capacitor\nThe coupling capacitor C1 in Figure 16 sees nearly a rectan-\ngular current waveform as shown in Figure 17. During the switch off-time the current through C1 is I\nO(VO/VIN) while \napproximately –I O ﬂ  ows during the on-time. This current \nwaveform creates a triangular ripple voltage on C1:\n \x02VC1 (P\x01P)=IO(MAX)\nC1\x81f\x81VO\nVIN+VO+VD\nThe maximum voltage on C1 is then:\n VC1 (MAX) =VIN+\x02VC1 (P\x01P)\n2\nwhich is typically close to V IN(MAX) . The ripple current \nthrough C1 is:\n IRMS(C1) =IO(MAX) \x81VO+VD\nVIN(MIN )\nThe value chosen for the DC coupling capacitor normally \nstarts with the minimum value that will satisfy 1) the RMS current requirement and 2) the peak voltage requirement (typically close to V\nIN). Low ESR ceramic and tantalum \ncapacitors work well here. \nSEPIC Converter Design Example\nThe design example given here will be for the circuit shown \nin Figure 18. The input voltage is 5V to 15V and the output is 12V at a maximum load current of 1.5A (2A peak).\n1. The duty cycle range is:\n  D=VO+VD\nVIN+VO+VD\x01\n\x03\x02\x04\n\x06\x05=45.5% to 71.4%\n \n2. The operating mode chosen is pulse skipping, so the \nMODE/SYNC pin is shorted to INTV CC.\nLTC1871\n291871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n3. The operating frequency is chosen to be 300kHz to \nreduce the size of the inductors; the resistor from the FREQ pin to ground is 80k.\n4. An inductor ripple current of 40% is chosen, so the peak \ninput current (which is also the minimum saturation current) is:\n IL1 (PEAK) =1+\x01\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81IO(MAX) \x81VO+VD\nVIN(MIN )\n=1+0.4\n2\x02\n\x04\x03\x05\n\x07\x06\x81 1.5 \x8112+0.5\n5=4.5A\n The inductor ripple current is:\n \x01IL=\x02\x81IO(MAX) \x81DMAX\n1–DMAX\n=0.4 \x81 1.5 \x810.714\n1–0.714=1.5A\n And so the inductor value is:\n L=VIN(MIN)\n2\x81\x01IL\x81f\x81DMAX=5\n2 \x81 1.5 \x81 300 k\x81 0.714 =4μH\n The component chosen is a BH Electronics BH510-\n1007, which has a saturation current of 8A.\n5. With an minimum input voltage of 5V , only logic-level \npower MOSFETs should be considered. Because the maximum duty cycle is 71.4%, the maximum SENSE pin threshold voltage is reduced from its low duty cycle typical value of 150mV to approximately 120mV .  Assuming a MOSFET junction temperature of 125°C, the room temperature MOSFET R\nDS(ON)  should be less \nthan:\n RDS(ON)\x04VSENSE(MAX)\nIO(MAX )\x811\n1+\x02\n2\x05\n\x07\x06\x08\n\n\t\x81\x03T\x811\nVO+VD\nVIN(MIN )\x05\n\x07\x06\x08\n\n\t+1\n=0.12\n1.5\x811\n1.2 \x811.5\x811\n12.5\n5\x05\n\x07\x06\x08\n\n\t+1=12.7m\x01\n For a SEPIC converter , the switch BV DSS rating must be \ngreater than V IN(MAX)  + VO, or 27V . This comes close to \nan IRF7811W , which is rated to 30V , and has a maximum room temperature R\nDS(ON)  of 12mΩ at V GS = 4.5V .6. The diode for this design must handle a maximum \nDC output current of 2A and be rated for a minimum reverse voltage of V\nIN + V OUT, or 27V . A 3A, 40V diode \nfrom International Rectiﬁ  er (30BQ040) is chosen for its \nsmall size, relatively low forward drop and acceptable reverse leakage at high temp.\n7. The output capacitor usually consists of a high valued \nbulk C connected in parallel with a lower valued, low ESR ceramic. Based on a maximum output ripple voltage of 1%, or 120mV , the bulk C needs to be greater than:\n  COUT\x01IOUT(MAX)\n0.01\x81 VOUT\x81f=\n1.5A\n0.01\x81 12V \x81 300kH z=41μF\n The RMS ripple current rating for this capacitor needs \nto exceed:\n  IRMS(COUT) \x01IO(MAX) \x81VO\nVIN(MIN )=\n1.5A \x8112V\n5V=2.3A\n To satisfy this high RMS current demand, two 47μF \nKemet capacitors (T495X476K020AS) are required. As a result, the output ripple voltage is a low 50mV to 60mV . In parallel with these tantalums, two 10μF , low ESR (X5R) Taiyo Yuden ceramic capacitors (TMK432BJ106MM) are added for HF noise reduction. Check the output ripple with a single oscilloscope probe connected directly across the output capacitor terminals, where the HF switching currents ﬂ  ow.\n8. The choice of an input capacitor for a SEPIC converter \ndepends on the impedance of the source supply and the amount of input ripple the converter will safely toler-ate. For this particular design and lab setup, a single 47μF Kemet tantalum capacitor (T495X476K020AS) is adequate. As with the output node, check the input ripple with a single oscilloscope probe connected across the input capacitor terminals. If any HF switching noise is observed it is a good idea to decouple the input with a low ESR, X5R ceramic capacitor as close to the V\nIN \nand GND pins as possible.\nLTC1871\n301871feAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n9. The DC coupling capacitor in a SEPIC converter is cho-\nsen based on its RMS current requirement and must be rated for a minimum voltage of V\nIN plus the AC ripple \nvoltage. Start with the minimum value which satisﬁ  es \nthe RMS current requirement and then check the ripple voltage to ensure that it doesn’t exceed the DC rating.\n  IRMS(CI)\x01IO(MAX) \x81VO+VD\nVIN(MIN )\n=1.5A \x8112V+0.5V\n5V=2.4A\nFigure 18a. 4.5V to 15V Input, 12V/2A Output SEPIC Converter\nFigure 18b.
