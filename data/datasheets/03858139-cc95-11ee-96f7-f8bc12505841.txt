#### Component Description:
The SBX-4 is a dual-channel DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) beacon module designed to enhance the accuracy of GPS receivers by providing reliable differential corrections. It operates within a frequency range of 283.5 to 325.0 kHz and utilizes Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) for demodulation. The module is capable of tracking the strongest signal or the closest station, ensuring optimal performance in various environments.

#### Typical Applications:
The SBX-4 is primarily used in applications requiring precise positioning and navigation, such as:
- Marine navigation systems
- Land surveying and mapping
- Agricultural guidance systems
- Autonomous vehicles and drones
- Any application where enhanced GPS accuracy is critical

This module is particularly beneficial in environments where GPS signals may be weak or obstructed, as it provides a reliable source of correction data from a network of beacon stations worldwide.
