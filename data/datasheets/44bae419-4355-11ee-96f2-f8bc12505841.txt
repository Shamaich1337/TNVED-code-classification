They are perfect \nfor demanding communications applications with AC \nperformance that includes 70.8dB SNR and 85dB spurious  \nfree dynamic range (SFDR). Ultralow jitter of 0.17ps RMS \nallows undersampling of IF frequencies with excellent \nnoise performance.\nDC specs include ±0.3LSB INL (typical), ±0.1LSB DNL \n(typical) and no missing codes over temperature. The \ntransition noise is a low 0.3LSB RMS.\nThe digital outputs can be either full-rate CMOS, double-\ndata rate CMOS, or double-data rate LVDS. A separate \noutput power  supply allows the CMOS output swing to \nrange from 1.2V to 1.8V.\nThe ENC+ and ENC– inputs may be driven differentially or \nsingle ended with a sine wave, PECL, LVDS, TTL or CMOS \ninputs.

Analog Input.\nGND (Pin 3): ADC Power Ground.REFH (Pins 4, 5): ADC High Reference. Bypass to Pins \n6, 7 with a 2.2µF ceramic capacitor and to ground with a \n0.1µF ceramic capacitor.REFL (Pins 6, 7): ADC Low Reference. Bypass to Pins \n4, 5 with a 2.2µF ceramic capacitor and to ground with a \n0.1µF ceramic capacitor.PAR/SER (Pin 8): Programming Mode Selection Pin. Con\n-\nnect to ground to enable the serial programming mode. \nCS, SCK, SDI, SDO become a serial interface that control \nthe A/D operating modes. Connect to VDD to enable the \nparallel programming mode where CS, SCK, SDI become \nparallel logic inputs that control a reduced set of the A/D \noperating modes. PAR/SER should be connected directly \nto ground or the VDD of the part and not be driven by a \nlogic signal.\nVDD (Pins 9, 10, 40): 1.8V Analog Power Supply. Bypass \nto ground with 0.1µF ceramic capacitors. Pins 9 and 10 \ncan share a bypass capacitor.\nENC+ (Pin 11): Encode Input. Conversion starts on the \nrising edge.\nENC– (Pin 12): Encode Complement Input. Conversion \nstarts on the falling edge.\nCS (Pin 13): In serial programming mode, (PAR /SER = \n0V), CS is the serial interface chip select input. When \nCS is low, SCK is enabled for shifting data on SDI into \nthe mode control registers. In the parallel programming \nmode (PAR /SER = V DD), CS controls the clock duty cycle \nstabilizer. When CS is low, the clock duty cycle stabilizer is \nturned off. When CS is high, the clock duty cycle stabilizer \nis turned on. CS can be driven with 1.8V to 3.3V logic.SCK (Pin 14): In serial programming mode, (PAR /SER = \n0V), SCK is the serial interface clock input. In the parallel \nprogramming mode (PAR /SER = VDD), SCK controls the \ndigital output mode. When SCK is low, the full-rate CMOS \noutput mode is enabled. When SCK is high, the double-\ndata rate LVDS output mode (with 3.5mA output current) \nis enabled. SCK can be driven with 1.8V to 3.3V logic.\nSDI (Pin 15): In serial programming mode, (PAR /SER = \n0V), SDI is the serial interface data input. Data on SDI is \nclocked into the mode control registers on the rising edge \nof SCK. In the parallel programming mode (PAR /SER = \nVDD), SDI can be used to power down the part. When SDI \nis low, the part operates normally. When SDI is high, the \npart enters sleep mode. SDI can be driven with 1.8V to \n3.3V logic.\nSDO (Pin 16): In serial programming mode, (PAR /SER \n= 0V), SDO is the optional serial interface data output. \nData on SDO is read back from the mode control registers \nand can be latched on the falling edge of SCK. SDO is an \nopen-drain NMOS output that requires an external 2k \npull-up resistor to 1.8V-3.3V. If read back from the mode \ncontrol registers is not needed, the pull-up resistor is not \nnecessary and SDO can be left unconnected. In the parallel \nprogramming mode (PAR /SER = VDD), SDO is not used \nand should not be connected.OGND (Pin 25): Output Driver Ground.\nOV\nDD (Pin 26): Output Driver Supply. Bypass to ground \nwith a 0.1µF ceramic capacitor.\nVCM (Pin 37): Common Mode Bias Output, Nominally \nEqual to VDD/2. VCM should be used to bias the common \nmode of the analog inputs. Bypass to ground with a 0.1µF \nceramic capacitor.\nVREF (Pin 38):  Reference  Voltage  Output. Bypass to ground  \nwith a 1µF ceramic capacitor, nominally 1.25V.\nSENSE (Pin 39): Reference Programming Pin. Connecting \nSENSE to VDD selects the internal reference and a ±1V input  \nrange. Connecting SENSE to ground selects the internal \nreference and a ±0.5V input range. An external reference \nbetween 0.625V and 1.3V applied to SENSE selects an \ninput range of ±0.8 • V SENSE .\nLTC2261-12\nLTC2260-12/LTC2259-1216\n226112fc For more information www.linear .com/L TC2261-12pin FuncTions\nFULL-RATE CMOS OUTPUT MODE\nAll Pins Below Have CMOS Output Levels (OGND to \nOVDD)\nD0 to D11 (Pins 19-24, 29-34): Digital Outputs.

The analog inputs should \nbe driven differentially. The encode input can be driven \ndifferentially or single ended for lower power consump -\ntion. The digital outputs can be CMOS, double-data rate \nCMOS ( to halve the number of output lines), or double- data \nrate LVDS (to reduce digital noise in the system.) Many \nadditional features can be chosen by programming the \nmode control registers through a serial SPI port. See the \nSerial Programming Mode section.\nANALOG INPUT\nThe analog input is a differential CMOS sample-and-hold \ncircuit (Figure 2). The inputs should be driven differentially \naround a common mode voltage set by the VCM output \npin, which is nominally VDD/2. For the 2V input range, the inputs should swing from VCM – 0.5V to VCM + 0.5V. \nThere should be 180° phase difference between the inputs.\nINPUT DRIVE CIRCUITS\nInput Filtering\nIf possible, there should be an RC lowpass filter right at \nthe analog inputs. This lowpass filter isolates the drive \ncircuitry from the A/D sample-and-hold switching, and \nalso limits  wideband  noise  from the drive circuitry . Figure  3 \nshows an example of an input RC filter. The RC component \nvalues should be chosen based on the application’s input \nfrequency. \nT ransformer Coupled Circuits\nFigure 3 shows the analog input being driven by an RF \ntransformer with a center-tapped secondary.

The encode inputs should \nbe treated as analog signals—do not route them next to \ndigital traces on the circuit board. There are two modes \nof operation for the encode inputs: the differential encode \nmode (Figure 10) and the single-ended encode mode \n(Figure 11). \nThe differential encode mode is recommended for sinu-\nsoidal, PECL or LVDS encode inputs (Figures 12, 13). The \nencode inputs are internally biased to 1.2V through 10k \nequivalent resistance. The encode inputs can be taken \nabove VDD (up to 3.6V), and the common mode range \nis from 1.1V to 1.6V. In the differential encode mode, \nENC– should stay at least 200mV above ground to avoid \nfalsely triggering the single-ended encode mode. For good \njitter performance ENC+ and ENC– should have fast rise \nand fall times.The single- ended encode mode should be used with CMOS  \nencode inputs. To select this mode, ENC– is connected \nto ground and ENC+ is driven with a square wave encode \ninput. ENC+ can be taken above VDD (up to 3.6V) so 1.8V \nto 3.3V  CMOS logic levels can be used. The ENC+ threshold  \nis 0.9V. For good jitter performance ENC+ should have fast \nrise and fall times.\nClock Duty Cycle Stabilizer\nFor good performance the encode signal should have a \n50%(±5%) duty cycle. If the optional clock duty cycle \nstabilizer circuit is enabled, the encode duty cycle can \nvary from 30% to 70% and the duty cycle stabilizer will \nmaintain a constant 50% internal duty cycle. If the encode \nsignal changes frequency or is turned off, the duty cycle \nstabilizer circuit requires one hundred clock cycles to lock \nonto the input clock. The duty cycle stabilizer is enabled \nby mode control register A2 (serial programming mode), \nor by CS (parallel programming mode).\nVDDL TC2261-12\n226112 F10ENC–ENC+15kVDDDIFFERENTIAL\nCOMPARATOR\n30k\nFigure 10.

If \nthe duty cycle stabilizer is disabled, care should be taken \nto make the sampling clock have a 50%(±5%) duty cycle. \nThe duty cycle stabilizer should not be used below 5Msps.\nDIGITAL OUTPUTS\nDigital Output Modes\nThe LTC2261-12/LTC2260-12/LTC2259-12 can operate \nin three digital output modes: full-rate CMOS, double-\ndata rate CMOS (to halve the number of output lines), \nor double-data rate LVDS (to reduce digital noise in the \nsystem). The output mode is set by mode control regis -\nter A3 (serial programming mode), or by SCK (parallel \nprogramming mode). Note that double-data rate CMOS \ncannot be selected in the parallel programming mode.\nFull-Rate CMOS Mode\nIn full-rate CMOS mode the 12 digital outputs (D0-D11), \noverflow (OF), and the data output clocks (CLKOUT+,  \nCLKOUT–) have CMOS output levels. The outputs are \npowered by OVDD and OGND which are isolated from the \nA/D core power and ground. OVDD can range from 1.1V \nto 1.9V, allowing 1.2V through 1.8V CMOS logic outputs. \nFor good performance the digital outputs should drive \nminimal capacitive loads. If the load capacitance is larger \nthan 10pF a digital buffer should be used.\nDouble-Data Rate CMOS Mode\nIn double- data rate CMOS mode, two data bits are \nmultiplexed and output on each data pin. This reduces \nthe number of data lines by seven, simplifying board \nrouting and reducing the number of input pins needed \nto receive the data. The 6 digital outputs (D0_1, D2_3, \nD4_5, D6_7, D8_9, D10_11), overflow (OF), and the data \noutput clocks (CLKOUT+, CLKOUT–) have CMOS output \nlevels. The outputs are powered by OVDD and OGND which \nare isolated from the A/D core power and ground. OVDD \ncan range from 1.1V to 1.9V, allowing 1.2V through 1.8V \nCMOS logic outputs. \nFor good performance the digital outputs should drive \nminimal capacitive loads. If the load capacitance is larger \nthan 10pF a digital buffer should be used.When using double-data rate CMOS at high sample rates \nthe SNR will degrade slightly (see Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section). DDR CMOS is not recommended \nfor sample frequencies above 100MHz.\nDouble-Data Rate LVDS Mode\nIn double- data rate LVDS mode, two data bits are \nmultiplexed and output on each differential output pair. \nThere are 6 LVDS output pairs  (D0_1+/D0_1– through \nD10_11+/D10_11–) for the digital output data. Overflow \n(OF+/OF–) and the data output clock ( CLKOUT+/CLKOUT–) \neach have an LVDS output pair. \nBy default the outputs are standard LVDS levels: 3.5mA \noutput current and a 1.25V output common mode volt-\nage. An external 100Ω differential termination resistor \nis required for each LVDS output pair. The termination \nresistors should be located as close as possible to the \nLVDS receiver. \nThe outputs are powered by OVDD and OGND which are \nisolated from the A/D core power and ground. In LVDS \nmode, OV DD must be 1.8V. \nProgrammable LVDS Output Current\nIn LVDS mode, the default output driver current is 3.5mA. \nThis current can be adjusted by serially programming mode  \ncontrol register A3. Available current levels are 1.75mA, \n2.1mA, 2.5mA, 3mA, 3.5mA, 4mA and 4.5mA.\nOptional LVDS Driver Internal Termination\nIn most cases using just an external 100Ω termination \nresistor will give excellent LVDS signal integrity. In addi-\ntion, an optional internal 100Ω termination resistor can \nbe enabled by serially programming mode control register \nA3. The internal termination helps absorb any reflections \ncaused by imperfect termination at the receiver. When the \ninternal termination is enabled, the output driver current \nis increased by 1.6x to maintain about the same output \nvoltage swing.\nLTC2261-12\nLTC2260-12/LTC2259-1223\n226112fc For more information www.linear .com/L TC2261-12Overflow Bit\nThe overflow output bit (OF) outputs a logic high when \nthe analog input is either overranged or underranged. The \noverflow bit has the same pipeline latency as the data bits.\nPhase Shifting the Output Clock\nIn full-rate CMOS mode the data output bits normally \nchange at the same time as the falling edge of CLKOUT+, \nso the rising edge of CLKOUT+ can be used to latch the \noutput data. In double-data rate CMOS and LVDS modes \nthe data output bits normally change at the same time as \nthe falling and rising edges of CLKOUT+. To allow adequate \nsetup-and-hold time when latching the data, the CLKOUT+ \nsignal may need to be phase shifted relative to the data \noutput bits. Most FPGAs have this feature; this is generally \nthe best place to adjust the timing.\nThe LTC2261-12/LTC2260-12/LTC2259-12 can also phase  \nshift the CLKOUT+/CLKOUT– signals by serially program -\nming mode control register A2. The output clock can be \nshifted by 0°, 45°, 90° or 135°. To  use the phase shifting \nfeature the clock duty cycle stabilizer must be turned \non. Another control register bit can invert the polarity of  CLKOUT+ and CLKOUT–, independently of the phase shift. \nThe combination of these two features enables phase shifts  \nof 45° up to 315° (Figure 14).\nDATA  FORMAT\nTable 1 shows the relationship between the analog input \nvoltage, the digital data output bits and the overflow bit. \nBy default the output data format is offset binary. The 2’s \ncomplement format can be selected by serially program -\nming mode control register A4.\nTable 1.

Digital interference may be from capacitive or \ninductive coupling or coupling through the ground plane. \nEven a tiny coupling factor can cause unwanted tones \nin the ADC output spectrum. By randomizing the digital \noutput before it is transmitted off chip, these unwanted \ntones can be randomized which reduces the unwanted \ntone amplitude.The digital output is randomized   by applying an exclusive-\nOR logic operation between the LSB and all other data \noutput bits. To decode, the reverse operation is applied— an \nexclusive-OR operation is applied between the LSB and \nall other bits. The LSB, OF and CLKOUT outputs are not \naffected. The output randomizer is enabled by serially \nprogramming mode control register A4.Alternate Bit PolarityAnother feature that reduces digital feedback on the circuit \nboard is the alternate bit polarity mode. When this mode \nis enabled, all of the odd bits (D1, D3, D5, D7, D9, D11) \nare inverted before the output buffers. The even bits (D0, \nD2, D4, D6, D8, D10), OF and CLKOUT are not affected. \nThis can reduce digital currents in the circuit board ground \nplane and reduce digital noise, particularly for \nvery small \nanalog input signals.\nWhen there is a very small signal at the input of the A/D \nthat is centered around mid-scale, the digital outputs toggle  \nbetween mostly 1s and mostly 0s. This simultaneous \nswitching of most of the bits will cause large currents in the \nground plane. By inverting every other bit, the alternate bit \npolarity mode makes half of the bits transition high while \nhalf of the bits transition low. To first order, this cancels \ncurrent flow in the ground plane, reducing the digital noise.applicaTions inForMaTion\nCLKOUT CLKOUT\nOF\nD11/D0\nD10/D0\n•\n••\nD2/D0\nD1/D0\nD0\n116112 F15OF\nD11\nD10\nD2\nD1\nD0RANDOMIZER\nOND11FPGAPC BOARD\nD10\n•\n••\nD2\nD1\nD0\n116112 F15D0D1/D0D2/D0D10/D0D11/D0OFCLKOUT\nL TC2261-12\nFigure 15.

The alternate \nbit polarity mode is independent of the digital output \nrandomizer—either, both or neither function can be on \nat the same time. When alternate bit polarity mode is on, \nthe data format is offset binary and the 2’s complement \ncontrol bit has no effect. The alternate bit polarity mode is \nenabled by serially programming mode control register A4.\nDigital Output Test Patterns\nTo allow in-circuit testing of the digital interface to the \nA/D, there are several test modes that force the A/D data \noutputs (OF, D11-D0) to known values:\nAll 1s: All outputs are 1All 0s: All outputs are 0\nAlternating: Outputs change from all 1s to all 0s on \nalternating samples\nCheckerboard: Outputs change from 1010101010101 \nto 0101010101010 on alternating samples\nThe digital output test patterns are enabled by serially \nprogramming mode control register A4. When enabled, \nthe test patterns override all other formatting modes: 2’s \ncomplement, randomizer, alternate-bit-polarity.\nOutput Disable\nThe digital outputs may be disabled by serially program\n-\nming mode control register A3. All digital outputs including  \nOF and CLKOUT are disabled. The high impedance disabled  \nstate is intended for long periods of inactivity—it is too \nslow to multiplex a data bus between multiple converters \nat full speed.\nSleep and Nap Modes\nThe A/D may be placed in sleep or nap modes to conserve \npower. In sleep mode the entire A/D converter is powered \ndown, resulting in 0.5mW power consumption. Sleep mode  \nis enabled by mode control register A1 (serial program -\nming mode), or by SDI (parallel programming mode). \nThe amount of time required to recover from sleep mode depends on the size of the bypass capacitors on VREF , \nREFH, and REFL. For the suggested values in Figure 8, \nthe A/D will stabilize after 2ms.\nIn nap mode the A/D core is powered down while the internal  \nreference circuits stay active, allowing faster wake-up than \nfrom sleep mode. Recovering from nap mode requires at \nleast 100 clock cycles. If the application demands very \naccurate DC settling then an additional 50µs should be \nallowed so the on-chip references can settle from the slight  \ntemperature shift caused by the change in supply current \nas the A/D leaves nap mode. Nap mode is enabled by mode \ncontrol register A1 in the  serial programming mode.\nDEVICE PROGRAMMING MODES\nThe operating modes of the LTC2261-12 can be pro-\ngrammed by either a parallel interface or a simple serial \ninterface. The serial interface has more flexibility and \ncan program all available modes. The parallel interface \nis more limited and can only program some of the more \ncommonly used modes. \nParallel Programming Mode\nTo use the parallel programming mode, PAR/SER should \nbe tied to VDD. The CS, SCK and SDI pins are binary logic \ninputs that set certain operating modes. These pins can \nbe tied to VDD or ground, or driven by 1.8V, 2.5V or 3.3V \nCMOS logic. Table 2 shows the modes set by CS, SCK \nand SDI.\nTable 2.

The CS, SCK, SDI and SDO pins become a \nserial interface that program the A/D mode control registers. \nData is written to a register with a 16-bit serial word. Data \ncan also be read back from a register to verify its contents.\nSerial data transfer starts when CS is taken low. The data \non the SDI pin is latched at the first 16 rising edges of \nSCK. Any SCK rising edges after the first 16 are ignored. \nThe data transfer ends when CS is taken high again.The first bit of the 16-bit input word is the R/W bit. The \nnext seven bits are the address of the register (A6:A0). \nThe final eight bits are the register data (D7:D0).If the R/W bit is low, the serial data (D7:D0) will be writ\n-\nten to the register set by the address bits (A6:A0). If the \nR/W bit is high, data in the register set by the address bits \n(A6:A0) will be read back on the SDO pin (see the timing diagrams). During a read back command  the register is \nnot updated and data on SDI is ignored.\nThe SDO pin is an open-drain output that pulls to ground \nwith a 200Ω impedance. If register data is read back \nthrough SDO, an external 2k pull-up resistor is required. If \nserial data is only written and read back is not needed, then \nSDO can be left floating and no pull-up resistor is needed.\nTable 3 shows a map of the mode control registers.\nSoftware Reset\nIf serial programming is used, the mode control registers \nshould be programmed as soon as possible after the power  \nsupplies turn on and are stable. The first serial command \nmust be a software reset which will reset all register data \nbits to logic 0. To perform a software reset, bit D7 in the \nreset register is written with a logic 1. After the reset SPI \nwrite command is complete, bit D7 is automatically set \nback to zero.\nTable 3.

A multilayer board with \nan internal ground plane is recommended. Layout for \nthe printed circuit board should ensure that digital and \nanalog signal lines are separated as much as possible. In \nparticular, care should be taken not to run any digital track \nalongside an analog signal track or underneath the ADC.\nHigh quality ceramic bypass capacitors should be used at \nthe VDD, OVDD, VCM, VREF, REFH and REFL pins. Bypass \ncapacitors must be located as close to the pins as possible. \nOf particular importance is the 0.1µF capacitor between \nREFH and REFL. This capacitor should be on the same \nside of the circuit board as the A/D, and as close to the \ndevice as possible (1.5mm or less). Size 0402 ceramic \ncapacitors are recommended. The larger 2.2µF capacitor \nbetween REFH and REFL can be somewhat further away. The VCM capacitor should be located as close to the pin \nas possible. To make space for this the capacitor on VREF \ncan be further away or on the back of the PC board. The \ntraces connecting the pins and bypass capacitors must \nbe kept short and should be made as wide as possible.\nThe analog inputs, encode signals, and digital outputs \nshould not be routed next to each other. Ground fill and \ngrounded vias should be used as barriers to isolate these \nsignals from each other.\nHEAT TRANSFER\nMost of the heat generated by the LTC2261-12 is trans -\nferred from the die through the bottom-side exposed pad \nand package leads onto the printed circuit board. For good \nelectrical and thermal performance, the exposed pad must \nbe soldered to a large grounded pad on the PC board. \nLTC2261-12\nLTC2260-12/LTC2259-1229\n226112fc For more information www.linear .com/L TC2261-12Typical applicaTions\nAIN+\nAIN–\nGND\nREFHREFHREFLREFL\nPAR/SER\nV\nDD\nVDDD7D6\nCLKOUT\n+\nCLKOUT–\nOVDD\nOGND\nD5D4D3D2123\n4\n56789\n1030292827262524\n23\n2221\nR13\n100/uni03A9ENCODE CLOCK\nSPI BUS226112 TA02C202.2µFC150.1µF\nPAR/SERR27 10/uni03A9R16\n100/uni03A9\nR28 10/uni03A9\nC210.1µF\nGND ENC\n+ENC–CS SCK SDI SDO DNC DNC D0 D1\n20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 1131 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n41VDDSENSE VREF VCM OF+OF–D11 D10 D9 D8\n0VDD\nC370.1µFLTC2261CUJC23\n1µFSENSE\nC17\n1µF\nC131µFC514.7pFR14\n1kR3933.2/uni03A9\n1%\nR40\n33.2/uni03A9\n1%\nC12\n0.1µFR15 100/uni03A9R10 10/uni03A9R9 10/uni03A9\nANALOG INPUTT2\nMABAES0060\n••\nC19\n0.1µF\nC18\n0.1µF\nDIGITALOUTPUTSDIGITAL\nOUTPUTS\nV\nDDVDDLTC2261 Schematic\nLTC2261-12\nLTC2260-12/LTC2259-1230\n226112fc For more information www.linear .com/L TC2261-12Typical applicaTions\nSilkscreen Top Top Side\nInner Layer 2 GND Inner Layer 3226112 TA03226112 TA04\n226112 TA05226112 TA06\nLTC2261-12\nLTC2260-12/LTC2259-1231\n226112fc For more information www.linear .com/L TC2261-12Typical applicaTions\nInner Layer 4 Inner Layer 5 Power\nBottom Side226112 TA07\n226112 TA08\n226112 TA09\nLTC2261-12\nLTC2260-12/LTC2259-1232\n226112fc For more information www.linear .com/L TC2261-12package DescripTion\nPlease refer to http://www .linear.com/designtools/packaging/ for the most recent package drawings.\n6.00 ±0.10\n(4 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
