Offset voltage and 1/f noise are suppressed, \nallowing this op amp to achieve a maximum offset voltage of ±4 µV and a 0.1  Hz to 10 Hz input noise voltage of 88 nV p -p \ntypical. The self cal ibrating circuitry of the ADA4523- 1 results in \nlow offset voltage drift with temperature ( 0.01 µV/°C maximum)  \nand zero drift over time. Additionally, the ADA4523 -1 uses  \non-chip filtering to achieve high immunity to electromagnetic \ninterference (EMI).   \nWid e supply range, combined with low noise, low offset, 168 dB \npower supply rejection ratio (PSRR), and 160 dB common -mode \nrejection ratio (CMRR), make the ADA4523 -1 well suited for high \ndynamic range test, measurement, and instrumentation systems.  \n TYPICAL APPLICATION DIAGRAM  \nR3\n5.62kΩR2\n750ΩR1\n1kΩ\nR4\n2ΩC1\n4.7µFC2\n47nF\nC3\n47µFC4\n0.1µFC5\n0.1µF\nADA4523-1LT6202VOUT8V TO 12.6V\n8V TO 36V\n+–\n+–\nC8\n20µF\n(FILM)R5\n10kΩ\nC7\n2.2µFC6\n0.1µFLTC6655-5VINVOUT_F\nSHDN8V TO 13.2V\nVOUT_S\n21094-001 \nFigure 1.

Block Diagram and Clamp Circuits (SD Is the Internal Shutdown)   \nINPUT VOLTAGE NOISE  \nChopper stabilized amplifiers , such as the ADA4523- 1, achieve \nlow offset and 1/f noise by heterodyning dc  and f licker noise to \nhigher frequencies. In a typical  chopper stabilized amplifier, this \nprocess results in idle tones at the chopping frequency and its \nodd harmonics.  \nThe ADA4523- 1 uses circuitry to suppress these spurious artifacts \nto below the offset voltage . The typical ripple magnitude at the \n330 kHz chopping frequency  is less than 1  µV rms.  \nThe input voltage noise spectral density  of the ADA4523- 1 is \nshown in  Figure 20. If lower noise is required, see Figure 75 in \nthe Applications Information  section .  \nINPUT CURRENT NOISE  \nFor applications with high source impedances, input current \nnoise can be a significant contributor to the total out put noise. \nFor this reason, it is important to consider noise current \ninteraction with circuit elements placed at the inputs of the  \namplifier.  \nThe input current noise spectral density of the ADA4523- 1 is \nshown in Fig ure 22 and as measured by the circuit in  Figure 65, \nwith a shunt capacitance ( CEXT) = 0 pF . The characteristic curve \nshows no  1/f behavior. As with all zero drift amplifiers, there is a \nsignificant curren t noise co mponent at the offset nulling \nfrequency , which is  discussed further in the Input Bias Current  \nsection.  It is important to note that the current noise is not equal  to 2qI B, \nwhere q is the  charge of a n electron, 1.6  × 10−19 Coulomb s. \nThis  formula is relevant for base current in bipolar transistors \nand diode currents . However , for most chopper and  autozero \namplifiers with switched inputs, the dominant current noise \nmechanism is not shot noise.  \n1MΩ\nCEXTTEST CIRCUIT\n21094-067+–\n \nFigure 65. Input Current Noise Spectrum  Test Circuit   \nINPUT BIAS CURRENT \nThe input bias current of the ADA4523- 1 comprise s two \ndifferent currents, leakage and charge injection. Leakage \ncurrent increase s with temperature, while the charge injection  \ncurren t from the switching input remains relatively constant \nwith temperature. The composite of these two currents over \ntemperature is shown  in Figure 14. \nHow the various input bias currents behave and contribute to error depends on the nature of the source impedance. For the \ninput bias currents specified in Table 1 and Table 2, the source \nimpedances are high value resistors bypassed with C\nEXT, in the \nsame configuration as shown in Figure 65. Figure 66 show s the \neffective dc error as an input referred current error (output dc \nvoltage error divided  by gain and the n by the source resistance) \nas a function of C EXT. Note that the effective dc  error decreases \nas the capacitance  increases. The added C EXT also reduces the \ninput referred current noise density  as shown in  Figure 67.  \n250\n100\n0 500EFFECTIVE IB (pA)\nCEXT (pF)115130145160175190205220235\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450VS = ±15V\nONE RANDOMLY SELECTED INPUT\n21094-069 \nFigure 66.

Input Referred Current Noise Density vs. Frequency for C EXT = 0 pF \nand C EXT = 50 pF  \nAnother function of the input capacitance is to reduce the \neffects of charge injection. The charge injection-based current \nhas frequency components at the 330 kHz chopping frequency \nand its harmonics. In the time domain, these frequency components appear as current pulses (appearing at regular intervals related to the chopping frequency). When these small current pulses interact with source impedances or gain setting resistors, the resulting voltage spikes are amplified by the closed-loop gain.  \nFor higher source impedances, this may cause the 330 kHz \nchopping frequency to be visible in the output spectrum, which is known as clock feedthrough. To prevent excessive clock feed-through, keep the gain setting resistors and source impedances as low as possible. When dc highly resistive source impedance is required, the capacitor across the source impedance reduces the \nac impedance, reducing the amplitude of the input voltage \nspikes. Another way to reduce clock injection effects is to \nbandwidth limit after the op amp output. \nInjection currents from the two inputs are of equal magnitude \nbut opposite direction. Therefore, when chopping behavior is the predominant source of I\nB, the effects of I B on the offset \nvoltage cannot be canceled by placing matched impedances at both inputs. \nAbove 50°C, ESD protection diode leakage current begins to \ndominate the input bias current and continues to increase \nexponentially at elevated temperatures. The input bias cancellation circuit of the ADA4523-1 minimizes this temperature driven growth of the leakage current to keep the input bias current low over all temperatures. Unlike injection current, leakage currents \nare in the same direction for both inputs. Therefore, the output \nerror due to leakage current may be mitigated by matching the source impedances seen by the two inputs. If the source impedance matching technique is employed to cancel the effect of the leakage currents, at less than 50°C, there is an offset voltage \nerror of 2I\nB × R due to the charge injection currents. For \nexample, if I B = 100 pA and R = 10 kΩ, the error is 2 μV . THERMOCOUPLE EFFECTS \nTo achieve accuracy on the microvolt level, consider thermo-\ncouple effects. Any connection of dissimilar metals forms a \nthermoelectric junction and generates a small temperature dependent voltage, which is known as the Seebeck effect. These \nthermal electric magnetic fields (EMFs) can be the dominant \nerror source in low drift circuits. \nConnectors, switches, relay contacts, sockets, resistors, and \nsolders are all candidates for significant thermal EMF generation. Even junctions of copper wire from different manufacturers can generate thermal EMFs of 200 nV/°C, which is over 10 times the maximum drift specification of the ADA4523-1. Figure 68 and Figure 69 illustrate the potential magnitude of these voltages and their sensitivity to temperature. \n3.0\n2.82.62.42.2\n1.82.0\n1.6\n1.41.21.00.80.60.40.2\n0\n25 30 35 40 45MICROVOLTS REFERRED TO 25°C\nTEMPERATURE (°C)\n21094-072 \nFigure 68.

Solder Copper Thermal EMFs  \nADA4523- 1 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 22 of 29 To min imize thermocouple induced errors, attention must be \ngiven to circuit board layout and component selection. It is good  \npractice to minimize the number of junctions in the input signal \npath of the op amp  and to avoid connectors, sockets, switches, and \nrelays whenever possible. If such components are required, \nselect these components  for low thermal EMF characteristics. \nFurthermore, match the number, type, and layout of junctions \nfor both inputs with respect to thermal gradients on the circuit \nboard , which can  involve deliberately introducing dummy \njunctions to offset unavoidable junctions.  \nAir currents can also lead to thermal gradients and cause significant noise in measurement systems. It is important to prevent airflow across sensitive circuits  because d oing so often  \nreduce s thermocouple noise substantially.  \nA summary of techniques is shown  in Figure 70. \n POWER DISSIPATION  \nBecause the ADA4523 -1 can operate  at a 36 V total supply, take \ncare with respect to power dissipation in the amplifier. When \ndriving heavy lo ads at high voltages, use the θ JA of the package \nto estimate the resulting die temperature rise and ensure that \nthe resulting junction temperature does not exceed specified limits. In addition, consider PCB metallization and heat sinking \nwhen high power dissipation is expected.  \nThe ADA4523- 1 LFCSP  features lower package thermal \nresistances compared to its standard counterparts. The LFCSP  \nexposed pad facilitates heat sinking. The exposed bottom pad \nmust be soldered to the PCB, and due to its internal connec tion \nto V\n−, connecting the exposed pad to V− is a requirement. For \nmore efficient heat sinking, it is recommended that the exposed pad have as  much PCB metal connected to the pad as reasonably  \navailable.  \nThermal information for the ADA4523 -1 packages can be \nfound in the Thermal Resistance  section.  \n \nHEAT SOURCE/\nPOWER DISSIPATOR\nTHERMAL\nGRADIENT\n1CUT SLOTS IN PCB FOR THERMAL ISOLATION.\n2INTRODUCE DUMMY JUNCTIONS AND COMPONENTS TO OFFSET UNAVOIDABLE JUNCTIONS OR CANCEL THERMAL EMFS.\n3ALIGN INPUTS SYMMETRICALLY WITH RESPECT TO THERMAL GRADIENTS.\n4INTRODUCE DUMMY TRACES AND COMPONENTS FOR SYMMETRICAL THERMAL HEAT SINKING.\n5LOADS AND FEEDBACK CAN DISSIPATE POWER AND GENERATE THERMAL GRADIENTS.

In the off  state, both amplifiers are shut off and \ndraw less than 2 0 µA (max imum  over temperature) of supply \ncurrent per amplifier. In addition , in the off  stage, both outputs \npresent hi gh impedances to external circuitry.  \nKeep in mind that during the off  state, even with the amplifier \noutput in high impedance, the output can still modulate by the \ninput signal through the input differential clamp and the \nfeedback resistor. ( See Figure 64 for the location of the \ndifferential clamp. ) In addition , depending on the resistor \nvalues, significant current can still be drawn from the input \nsource.  \nShutdown control is accomplished using the  separate logic  SD\nreference  voltage  input (SDCOM) and the shutdown pin ( SD). \nThis method allows low voltage digital control logic to operate independently of the high voltage supply rails of the op amp. A summary of  the shutdown control logic and operatin g ranges is \nshown in \nTable 8 and Table 9. \n \n Table 8.

The power of the \ncorrelated signal is  multiplied by N, while the power of the \nuncorrelated noise is multiplied by √N . The net effect is a √ N \nimprovement in signal -to-noise ratio.   \nThe resulting overall input current of the paralleled amplifiers is  \nthe sum of the input currents of each of the amplifiers , and the \ncurrent noise scale s accordingly.  \nWhen the current noise of an amplifier is far smaller than its \nvoltage noise, as is the case with  ADA4523- 1, and the current \nnoise does not pass through large impedances, trading  higher \ncurrent noise for lower voltage noise can be advantageous .  \nThe overall gain of the circuit depicted in Figure 75 is \nAV = (R2/R1 + 1) ×  (R4/R3 + 1) \nIf N is the number of paralleled amplifiers , the resulting change \nin input  refer red noise due to paralleling is  \n0.1 Hz to 10 Hz Noise  = 88 nV  p-p/√N \nen = (4.2 nV/√ Hz)/√N \nin = √N × 1 pA/ √Hz  \nIB = N × 300 pA (max imum  at 25°C ) \nFor the example of N = 4, a s shown in Figure 75, the exact \nresults are  the following : \n0.1 Hz to 10 Hz Noise  = 44 nV  p-p \nen = 2.1 nV/√Hz  \nin = 2 pA/ √Hz  \nIB = 300 pA (max imum  at 25°C ) \nR5 in Figure 75 must  be a few hundred  ohms to isolate the \nindividual amplifier outputs without contributing significantly to noise or I\nB induced error.  The choice of output amplifier is important for headroom , \nprecision,  and noise concerns as well. In Figure 75, the 60 V \nheadroom of the LTC2057HV  allows a wide signal swing, and  \nits zero -drift input does not add significant offse t.  \nIf enoug h gain is taken in the parallel amplifier stage for the \ninput si gnal of the LTC2057HV  to be large compared to its own \ninput noise voltage of 11 nV/√ Hz, the effect of the noise of the \nLTC2057HV  is reduced in the overall output . To minimize the \nnoise contribution of the output amplifier, choose  the first stage \ngain of  (R2/R1 + 1) to be far larger than √N  as well. \nR1R2R5\nR1R2R5\nR1R2R5\nR1R2R5R3R4LTC2057HV+30V\n–30VADA4523-1\nADA4523-1\nADA4523-1\nADA4523-1VIN\nVOUT+\n–\n+\n–+\n–+\n–+\n–\n21094-079 \nFigure 75.
