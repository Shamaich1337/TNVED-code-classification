Users should check for and obtain the latest relevant information and verify that such information is current and \ncomplete before placing orders for Bourns® products.\nThe characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® product set forth in its data sheet are based on laboratory conditions, and \nstatements regarding the suitability of products for certain types of applications are based on Bourns’  knowledge of typical \nrequirements in generic applications.  The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® product in a user application may vary \nfrom the data sheet characteristics and parameters due to (i) the combination of the Bourns® product with other components \nin the user’s application, or (ii) the environment of the user application itself.  The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® \nproduct also can and do vary in different applications and actual performance may vary over time.  Users should always verify \nthe actual performance of the Bourns® product in their specific devices and applications, and make their own independent \njudgments regarding the amount of additional test margin to design into their device or application to compensate for  \ndifferences between laboratory and real world conditions.\nUnless Bourns has explicitly designated an individual Bourns® product as meeting the requirements of a particular industry \nstandard (e.g., ISO/TS 16949) or a particular qualification (e.g., UL  listed or recognized), Bourns is not responsible for any \nfailure of an individual Bourns® product to meet the requirements of such industry standard or particular qualification.  Users of \nBourns® products are responsible for ensuring compliance with safety-related requirements and standards applicable to their \ndevices or applications.\nBourns® products are not recommended, authorized or intended for use in nuclear , lifesaving, life-critical or life-sustaining ap -\nplications, nor in any other applications where failure or malfunction may result in personal injury , death, or severe property or \nenvironmental damage.  Unless expressly and specifically approved in writing by two authorized Bourns representatives on a \ncase-by-case basis, use of any Bourns® products in such unauthorized applications might not be safe and thus is at the user ’s \nsole risk.  Life-critical applications include devices identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as Class III devices and \ngenerally equivalent classifications outside of the United States.\nBourns expressly identifies those Bourns® standard products that are suitable for use in automotive applications on such  \nproducts’ data sheets in the section entitled “Applications.”  Unless expressly and specifically approved in writing by two  \nauthorized Bourns representatives on a case-by-case basis, use of any other Bourns® standard products in an automotive \napplication might not be safe and thus is not recommended, authorized or intended and is at the user ’s sole risk.  If Bourns \nexpressly identifies a sub-category of automotive application in the data sheet for its standard products (such as infotainment \nor lighting), such identification means that Bourns has reviewed its standard product and has determined that if such Bourns® \nstandard product is considered for potential use in automotive applications, it should only be used in such sub-category of \nautomotive applications.  Any reference to Bourns® standard product in the data sheet as compliant with the AEC-Q standard \nor “automotive grade” does not by itself mean that Bourns has approved such product for use in an automotive application.\nBourns® standard products are not tested to comply with United States Federal Aviation Administration standards generally \nor any other generally equivalent governmental organization standard applicable to products designed or manufactured for \nuse in aircraft or space applications. Bourns expressly identifies Bourns® standard products that are suitable for use in aircraft \nor space applications on such products’ data sheets in the section entitled “Applications.”  Unless expressly and specifically \napproved in writing by two authorized Bourns representatives on a case-by-case basis, use of any other Bourns® standard \nproduct in an aircraft or space application might not be safe and thus is not recommended, authorized or intended and is at the \nuser’s sole risk.\nThe use and level of testing applicable to Bourns® custom products shall be negotiated on a case-by-case basis by Bourns and \nthe user for which such Bourns® custom products are specially designed.  Absent a written agreement between Bourns and the \nuser regarding the use and level of such testing, the above provisions applicable to Bourns® standard products shall also apply \nto such Bourns® custom products.\nUsers shall not sell, transfer, export or re-export any Bourns® products or technology for use in activities which involve the \ndesign, development, production, use or stockpiling of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or missiles, nor shall they use \nBourns® products or technology in any facility which engages in activities relating to such devices.
