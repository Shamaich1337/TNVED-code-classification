Refer to the Block Diagram which shows the L T3580 in a boost configuration. At the start of each oscillator cycle, the SR latch (SR1) is set, which turns on the power switch, Q1. The switch current flows through the internal current sense resistor generating a voltage proportional to the switch current. This voltage (amplified by A4) is added to a stabilizing ramp and the resulting sum is fed into the positive terminal of the PWM comparator A3. When this voltage exceeds the level at the negative input of A3, the SR latch is reset, turning off the power switch. The level at the negative input of A3 (VC pin) is set by the error amplifier A1 (or A2) and is simply an amplified version of the difference between the feedback voltage (FB pin) and the reference voltage (1.215V or 5mV depending on the configuration). \nIn this manner , the error amplifier sets the correct peak current level to keep the output in regulation. \nThe L T3580 has a novel FB pin architecture that can be \nused for either boost or inverting configurations. When configured as a boost converter, the FB pin is pulled up to the internal bias voltage of 1.215V by the R\nFB resistor \nconnected from V OUT to FB. Comparator A2 becomes \ninactive and comparator A1 performs the inverting amplification from FB to VC. When the L T3580 is in an inverting configuration, the FB pin is pulled down to 5mV by the R\nFB resistor connected from V OUT to FB. Comparator \nA1 becomes inactive and comparator A2 performs the noninverting amplification from FB to VC.–+–\n+\n–+–++–\n∑7\n5\n31.215V\nREFERENCE\nADJUSTABLE\nOSCILLATORFREQUENCY\nFOLDBACKRAMP\nGENERATORCOMPARATORDISCHARGE\nDETECTSS VC\n275k\nQ2SR2\nR\nS\n14.6k\n14.6kQSR1\nA3\nA4 A1\nA2\nSYNC÷N\nRTSHDN\nFB1.3V\nVC\nC1SW\n0.01Ω\nGND\nRTRFBDRIVERL1\nD1\nILIMIT\nVINVOUTCSS CC CINRC\nVIN\nSOFT-\nSTART\nSYNC\nBLOCKUVLO\nR\nSQ\n62\n1\n3580 BD84\nQ1\n9\nOPERATION\nLT3580\n73580fgOPERATION\nFigure 1.

This topology allows for the input to be higher, equal, or lower then the desired output voltage. Output disconnect is inherently built into the SEPIC topology, meaning no DC path exists between the input and output. This is useful for applications requiring the output to be disconnected from the input source when the circuit is in shutdown.\nInverting Topology\nThe L T3580 can also work in a dual inductor inverting \ntopology. The part’s unique feedback pin allows for the inverting topology to be built by simply changing the connection of external components. This solution results in very low output voltage ripple due to inductor L2 in series with the output. Abrupt changes in output capacitor current are eliminated because the output inductor deliv-ers current to the output during both the off-time and the on-time of the L T3580 switch.\nStart-Up Operation\nSeveral functions are provided to enable a very clean \nstart-up for the L T3580. \n• First, the SHDN  pin voltage is monitored by an internal \nvoltage reference to give a precise turn-on voltage level. An external resistor (or resistor divider) can be connected from the input power supply to the SHDN pin to provide \na user-programmable undervoltage lockout function. • Second, the soft-start circuitry provides for a gradual \nramp-up of the switch current. When the part is brought out of shutdown, the external SS capacitor is first discharged (providing protection against SHDN  pin \nglitches and slow ramping), then an integrated 275k resistor pulls the SS pin up to ~2.2V. By connecting an external capacitor to the SS pin, the voltage ramp rate  on the pin can be set. Typical values for the soft-start capacitor range from 100nF to 1μF.\n• Finally, the frequency foldback circuit reduces the \nswitching frequency when the FB pin is in a nominal range of 350mV to 900mV. This feature reduces the minimum duty cycle that the part can achieve thus allowing better control of the switch current during start-up. When the FB voltage is pulled outside of this range, the switching frequency returns to normal.\nCurrent Limit and Thermal Shutdown Operation\nThe L T3580 has a current limit circuit not shown in the \nBlock Diagram. The switch current is consistently moni-tored and not allowed to exceed the maximum switch current at a given duty cycle (see the Electrical Charac-teristics table). If the switch current reaches this value, the SR latch (SR1) is reset regardless of the state of the comparator (A1/A2). Also not shown in the Block Diagram is the thermal shutdown circuit. If the temperature of the part exceeds approximately 165°C, the SR2 latch is set regardless of the state of the comparator (A1/A2). A full soft-start cycle will then be initiated. The current limit and thermal shutdown circuits protect the power switch as well as the external components connected to the L T3580. \nLT3580\n83580fgSetting Output Voltage\nThe output voltage is set by connecting a resistor (R FB) \nfrom V OUT to the FB pin. R FB is determined from the \nfollowing equation:\n  RFB=|VOUT−VFB|\n83.3µA\nwhere V FB is 1.215V (typical) for non-inverting topologies \n(i.e., boost and SEPIC regulators) and 5mV (typical) for inverting topologies (see the Electrical Characteristics).\nPower Switch Duty Cycle \nIn order to maintain loop stability and deliver adequate \ncurrent to the load, the power NPN (Q1 in the Block Dia-gram) cannot remain “on” for 100% of each clock cycle.  \nThe maximum allowable duty cycle is given by:\n \nDCMAX=(TP−Min Off Time)\nTP\x81 100%\nwhere T P is the clock period and Min Off Time (found in \nthe Electrical Characteristics) is typically 60ns.\nThe application should be designed so that the operating \nduty cycle does not exceed DC MAX.\nDuty cycle equations for several common topologies are \ngiven below, where V D is the diode forward voltage drop \nand V CESAT  is typically 300mV at 1.5A.\nFor the boost topology:\n  DC≅VOUT−VIN+VD\nVOUT+VD−VCESAT\nFor the SEPIC or dual inductor inverting topology (see \nFigures 1 and 2):\n  DC≅VD+|VOUT|\nVIN+|VOUT|+VD−VCESAT\nThe L T3580 can be used in configurations where the duty \ncycle is higher than DC MAX, but it must be operated in the \ndiscontinuous conduction mode so that the effective duty cycle is reduced.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInductor Selection \nGeneral Guidelines : The high frequency operation of the \nL T3580 allows for the use of small surface mount inductors. For high efficiency, choose inductors with high frequency core material, such as ferrite, to reduce core losses. To improve efficiency, choose inductors with more volume for a given inductance. The inductor should have low DCR (copper wire resistance) to reduce I\n2R losses, and \nmust be able to handle the peak inductor current without saturating. Note that in some applications, the current handling requirements of the inductor can be lower, such as in the SEPIC topology, where each inductor only carries a fraction of the total switch current. Molded chokes or chip inductors usually do not have enough core area to sup-port peak inductor currents in the 2A to 3A range. To minimize radiated noise, use a toroidal or shielded inductor. Note that the inductance of shielded types will drop more as current increases, and will saturate more easily. See Table 1 for a list of inductor manufacturers. Thorough lab evaluation is recommended to verify that the following guidelines properly suit the final application. \nTable 1.Inductor Manufacturers\nCoilcraft DO3316P , MSS7341 and LPS4018 \nSerieswww.coilcraft.com\nCoiltronics DR, LD and CD Series www.coiltronics.com\nMurata LQH55D and LQH66S Series www.murata.com\nSumida CDRH5D18B/HP , CDR6D23MN,\nCDRH6D26/HP , CDRH6D28,\nCDR7D28MN and CDRH105R Serieswww.sumida.com\nTDK RLF7030 and VLCF4020 Series www.tdk.com\nWürth WE-PD and WE-PD2 Series www.we-online.com\nMinimum Inductance : Although there can be a tradeoff with \nefficiency, it is often desirable to minimize board space by choosing smaller inductors. When choosing an inductor , there are two conditions that limit the minimum inductance; (1) providing adequate load current, and (2) avoidance of subharmonic oscillation.

Multilayer ceramic capacitors are an excellent choice, as they have an extremely low ESR and are available in very small packages. X5R or X7R dielectrics are preferred, as \nLT3580\n103580fgAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nthese materials retain their capacitance over wider voltage \nand temperature ranges. A 4.7μF to 20μF output capaci-tor is sufficient for most applications, but systems with very low output currents may need only a 1μF or 2.2μF output capacitor . Always use a capacitor with a sufficient voltage rating. Many capacitors rated at 2.2μF to 20μF , particularly 0805 or 0603 case sizes, have greatly reduced capacitance at the desired output voltage. Solid tantalum or OS-CON capacitors can be used, but they will occupy more board area than a ceramic and will have a higher ESR with greater output ripple. \nCeramic capacitors also make a good choice for the input \ndecoupling capacitor , which should be placed as closely as possible to the L T3580. A 2.2μF to 4.7μF input capacitor is sufficient for most applications.\nTable 2 shows a list of several ceramic capacitor manufac-\nturers. Consult the manufacturers for detailed information \non their entire selection of ceramic parts. \nTable 2. Ceramic Capacitor Manufacturers\nKemet www.kemet.com\nMurata www.murata.comTaiyo Yuden www.t-yuden.comCompensation—Adjustment \nTo compensate the feedback loop of the L T3580, a series \nresistor-capacitor network in parallel with a single capacitor should be connected from the VC pin to GND. For most applications, the series capacitor should be in the range of 470pF to 2.2nF with 1nF being a good starting value.  The parallel capacitor should range in value from 10pF to 100pF with 47pF a good starting value. The compensation resistor , R\nC, is usually in the range of 5k to 50k. A good \ntechnique to compensate a new application is to use a 100k Ω potentiometer in place of series resistor R\nC. With \nthe series capacitor and parallel capacitor at 1nF and 47pF respectively, adjust the potentiometer while observing the transient response and the optimum value for R\nC can be \nfound. Figures 3a to 3c illustrate this process for the circuit of Figure 14 with a load current stepped between 400mA and 500mA. Figure 3a shows the transient response with R\nC equal to 1k. The phase margin is poor, as evidenced by \nthe excessive ringing in the output voltage and inductor current. In Figure 3b, the value of R\nC is increased to 3k, \nwhich results in a more damped response. Figure 3c shows the results when R\nC is increased further to 10k. The \ntransient response is nicely damped and the compensation procedure is complete.\nFigure 3a. Transient Response Shows Excessive Ringing Figure 3b. Transient Response Is Better\nFigure 3c.

T wo feedback loops are used in the L T3580—a fast current loop which does not require compensation, and a slower voltage loop which does. Standard bode plot analysis can be used to understand and adjust the voltage feedback loop.\nAs with any feedback loop, identifying the gain and phase \ncontribution of the various elements in the loop is critical.  \nFigure 4 shows the key equivalent elements of a boost converter. Because of the fast current control loop, the power stage of the IC, inductor and diode have been replaced by a combination of the equivalent transconductance amplifier g\nmp and the current controlled current source \n(which converts I VIN to ηVIN/VOUT • IVIN). gmp acts as \na current source where the peak input current, I VIN, is \nproportional to the VC voltage. η is the efficiency of the \nswitching regulator , and is typically about 88%.\nNote that the maximum output currents of g mp and g ma are \nfinite. The limits for g mp are in the Electrical Characteristics \nsection (switch current limit), and g ma is nominally limited \nto about ±12μA.From Figure 4, the DC gain, poles and zeros can be cal-\nculated as follows:\n  Output Pole: P1 =2\n2\x81π\x81RL\x81COUT\nError Amp Pole: P2 =1\n2\x81π\x81RO+RC ⎡⎣ ⎤⎦\x81CC\nError Amp Zero: Z1 =1\n2\x81π\x81RC\x81CC\nDC Gain:\n(Breaking Loop at FB Pin)\nADC = AOL(0) = ∂VC\n∂VFB\x81∂IVIN\n∂VC\x81∂VOUT\n∂IVIN\x81∂VFB\n∂VOUT=\ngma\x81R0 ( )\x81gmp\x81η\x81VIN\nVOUT\x81RL\n2⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\x810.5R2\nR1+0.5R2\nESR Zero: Z2 =1\n2\x81π\x81RESR\x81COUT\nRHP Zero: Z3 =VIN2\x81RL\n2\x81π\x81VOUT2\x81L\nHigh Frequency Pole: P3 >fS\n3\nPhase Lead Zero: Z4 =1\n2\x81π\x81R 1\x81CPL\nPhase Lead Pole: P4 =1\n2\x81π\x81R1\x81R2\n2\nR1+R2\n2\x81CPL\nError Amp Filter Pole:\nP5 = 1\n2\x81π\x81RC\x81RO\nRC+RO\x81CF,CF<CC\n10\nThe current mode zero (Z3) is a right-half plane zero \nwhich can be an issue in feedback control design, but is manageable with proper external component selection.\nFigure 4.

The crossover frequency is 10kHz, which is more than three times lower than the frequency of the RHP zero to achieve adequate phase margin.Diode Selection \nSchottky diodes, with their low forward voltage drops and \nfast switching speeds, are recommended for use with the L T3580. The Microsemi UPS120 is a very good choice. Where the input-to-output voltage differential exceeds 20V , use the UPS140 (a 40V diode). These diodes are rated to handle an average forward current of 1A.\nOscillator \nThe operating frequency of the L T3580 can be set by the \ninternal free-running oscillator . When the SYNC pin is driven low (< 0.4V), the frequency of operation is set by a resistor from R\nT to ground. An internally trimmed timing \ncapacitor resides inside the IC. The oscillator frequency is calculated using the following formula:\n fOSC=91.9\n(RT+1)\nwhere f OSC is in MHz and R T is in k Ω. Conversely, R T \n(in kΩ) can be calculated from the desired frequency \n(in MHz) using:\n  RT=91.9\nfOSC−1\nClock Synchronization \nThe operating frequency of the L T3580 can be synchronized \nto an external clock source. To synchronize to the external source, simply provide a digital clock signal into the SYNC pin. The L T3580 will operate at the SYNC clock frequency. The L T3580 will revert to the internal free-running oscillator clock after SYNC is driven low for a few free-running clock periods.\nDriving SYNC high for an extended period of time effectively \nstops the operating clock and prevents latch SR1 from becoming set (see the Block Diagram). As a result, the switching operation of the L T3580 will stop.\nThe duty cycle of the SYNC signal must be between 35% \nand 65% for proper operation. Also, the frequency of the SYNC signal must meet the following two criteria:\nFigure 5.

The first is staying clear of sensitive frequency bands, which cannot tolerate any spectral noise. For example, in products incorporating RF communications, the 455kHz IF frequency is sensitive to any noise, therefore switching above 600kHz is desired.  \nSome communications have sensitivity to 1.1MHz, and in that case, a 1.5MHz switching converter frequency may be employed. The second consideration is the physical size of the converter . As the operating frequency goes up, the inductor and filter capacitors go down in value and size.  \nThe tradeoff is efficiency, since the switching losses due to NPN base charge (see Thermal Calculations), Schottky diode charge, and other capacitive loss terms increase proportionally with frequency.\nSoft-Start \nThe L T3580 contains a soft-start circuit to limit peak switch \ncurrents during start-up. High start-up current is inherent in switching regulators in general since the feedback loop is saturated due to V\nOUT being far from its final value. The \nregulator tries to charge the output capacitor as quickly as possible, which results in large peak currents.\nThe start-up current can be limited by connecting an \nexternal capacitor (typically 100nF to 1μF) to the SS pin. This capacitor is slowly charged to ~2.2V by an internal 275k resistor once the part is activated. SS pin voltages below ~1.1V reduce the internal current limit. Thus, the gradual ramping of the SS voltage also gradually increases the current limit as the capacitor charges. This, in turn, allows the output capacitor to charge gradually toward its final value while limiting the start-up current.\nIn the event of a commanded shutdown or lockout ( SHDN  \npin), internal undervoltage lockout (UVLO) or a thermal lockout, the soft-start capacitor is automatically discharged \nto ~200mV before charging resumes, thus assuring that the soft-start occurs after every reactivation of the chip.\nShutdown \nThe SHDN pin is used to enable or disable the chip. \nFor most applications, SHDN can be driven by a digital \nlogic source. Voltages above 1.38V enable normal active operation. Voltages below 300mV will shutdown the chip, resulting in extremely low quiescent current.\nWhile the SHDN voltage transitions through the lockout \nvoltage range (0.3V to 1.24V) the power switch is disabled and the SR2 latch is set (see the Block Diagram). This causes the soft-start capacitor to begin discharging, which continues until the capacitor is discharged and active operation is enabled. Although the power switch is disabled, SHDN voltages in the lockout range do not \nnecessarily reduce quiescent current until the SHDN voltage \nis near or below the shutdown threshold.\nAlso note that SHDN can be driven above V\nIN or V OUT as \nlong as the SHDN voltage is limited to less than 32V.\nFigure 6. Chip States vs SHDN  Voltage\nConfigurable Undervoltage Lockout \nFigure 7 shows how to configure an undervoltage lockout \n(UVLO) for the L T3580. Typically, UVLO is used in situations where the input supply is current-limited, has a relatively high source resistance, or ramps up/down slowly. A switching regulator draws constant power from the source, so source current increases as source voltage drops. This looks like a negative resistance load to the source and can cause the source to current-limit or latch low under low (HYSTERESIS AND TOLERANCE)\nSHUTDOWN\n(LOW QUIESCENT CURRENT)ACTIVE\n(NORMAL OPERATION)\nLOCKOUT\n(POWER SWITCH OFF ,\nSS CAPACITOR DISCHARGED)1.24V\n0.0V1.38V\n0.3V\n3580 F06SHDN  (V)\nLT3580\n143580fgAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nsource voltage conditions. UVLO prevents the regulator \nfrom operating at source voltages where these problems might occur .\nThe shutdown pin comparator has voltage hysteresis with \ntypical thresholds of 1.32V (rising) and 1.29V (falling).  \nResistor R\nUVLO2  is optional. R UVLO2  can be included \nto reduce the overall UVLO voltage variation caused by variations in SHDN  pin  current (see the Electrical Character-\nistics). A good choice for R\nUVLO2  is ≤10k ±1%. After \nchoosing a value for R UVLO2 , RUVLO1  can be determined \nfrom either of the following:\n RUVLO1 =VIN+−1.32V\n1.32V\nRUVLO2⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟+11.6μA\nor\nRUVLO1 =VIN−−1.29V\n1.29V\nRUVLO2⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟+11.6μA\nwhere V IN+ and V IN– are the V IN voltages when rising or \nfalling respectively.\nFor example, to disable the L T3580 for V IN voltages below \n3.5V using the single resistor configuration, choose:\n   RUVLO1 =3.5V −1.29V\n1.29V\n∞⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟+11.6μA=190.5kFigure 7.

When V\nIN is detected low, the power switch is \ndeactivated, and while sufficient V IN voltage persists, the \nsoft-start capacitor is discharged. After V IN is detected \nhigh, the power switch will be reactivated and the soft-start capacitor will begin charging.\nThermal Considerations \nFor the L T3580 to deliver its full output power , it is imperative \nthat a good thermal path be provided to dissipate the heat generated within the package. This is accomplished by taking advantage of the thermal pad on the underside of the IC. It is recommended that multiple vias in the printed circuit board be used to conduct heat away from the IC and into a copper plane with as much area as possible.\nThermal Lockout \nIf the die temperature reaches approximately 165°C, the \npart will go into thermal lockout, the power switch will be turned off and the soft-start capacitor will be discharged.  The part will be enabled again when the die temperature has dropped by ~5°C (nominal).\nThermal Calculations \nPower dissipation in the L T3580 chip comes from four \nprimary sources: switch I\n2R loss, NPN base drive (AC), NPN \nbase drive (DC), and additional input current. The following formulas can be used to approximate the power losses. These formulas assume continuous mode operation, RUVLO2\n(OPTIONAL)1.3VRUVLO1\n3580 F07VINVIN\nACTIVE/\nLOCKOUT\nGND11.6μA\nAT 1.3V–\n+SHDN\nLT3580\n153580fgAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nso they should not be used for calculating efficiency in \ndiscontinuous mode or at light load currents.\n  Average Input Current: IIN=VOUT\x81IOUT\nVIN\x81η\nSwitch I2R Loss: PSW=(DC)(IIN)2(RSW)\nBase Drive Loss (AC): PBAC=13n(IIN)(VOUT)(f)\nBase Drive Loss (DC): PBDC=(VIN)(IIN)(DC)\n50\nInput Power Loss: PINP=7mA(VIN)\nwhere:\nRSW = switch resistance (typically 200m Ω at 1.5A)\nDC = duty cycle (see the Power Switch Duty Cycle sec-\ntion for formulas)\nη = power conversion efficiency (typically 88% at high \ncurrents)\nExample: boost configuration, V IN = 5V , V OUT = 12V , \nIOUT = 0.5A, f = 1.25MHz, V D = 0.5V:\n IIN = 1.36A\n DC = 61.5% P\nSW = 228mW\n P BAC = 270mW\n P BDC = 84mW\n P INP = 35mW\n Total L T3580 power dissipation (P TOT) = 617mW\nThermal resistance for the L T3580 is influenced by the pres-\nence of internal, topside or backside planes. To calculate die temperature, use the appropriate thermal resistance number and add in worst-case ambient temperature:\n T\nJ = TA + θJA • PTOT\nwhere T J = junction temperature, T A = ambient tempera-\nture, θJA = 43°C/W for the 3mm × 3mm DFN package and \n35°C/W to 40°C/W for the MSOP Exposed Pad package. P\nTOT is calculated above.VIN Ramp Rate\nWhile initially powering a switching converter application, \nthe V IN ramp rate should be limited. High V IN ramp rates can \ncause excessive inrush currents in the passive components of the converter. This can lead to current and/or voltage overstress and may damage the passive components or the chip. Ramp rates less than 500mV/μs, depending on component parameters, will generally prevent these issues.  Also, be careful to avoid hot-plugging. Hot-plugging occurs when an active voltage supply is “instantly” connected or switched to the input of the converter. Hot-plugging results in very fast input ramp rates and is not recommended. Finally, for more information, refer to Linear application note AN88, which discusses voltage overstress that can occur when an inductive source impedance is hot-plugged to an input pin bypassed by ceramic capacitors.\nLayout Hints \nAs with all high frequency switchers, when considering \nlayout, care must be taken to achieve optimal electrical, thermal and noise performance. One will not get adver-tised performance with a careless layout. For maximum efficiency, switch rise and fall times are typically in the 5ns to 10ns range. To prevent noise, both radiated and conducted, the high speed switching current path, shown in Figure 8, must be kept as short as possible. This is imple-mented in the suggested layout of a boost configuration in Figure 9. Shortening this path will also reduce the parasitic trace inductance. At switch-off, this parasitic inductance produces a flyback spike across the L T3580 switch. When operating at higher currents and output voltages, with poor layout, this spike can generate voltages across the L T3580 that may exceed its absolute maximum rating. A ground plane should also be used under the switcher circuitry to prevent interplane coupling and overall noise.\nThe VC and FB components should be kept as far away \nas practical from the switch node. The ground for these components should be separated from the switch cur-rent path. Failure to do so can result in poor stability or subharmonic oscillation.\nLT3580\n163580fgAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nC2, for best load regulation. You can tie the local ground \ninto the system ground plane at the C3 ground terminal.\nThe cut ground copper at D1’s cathode is essential to \nobtain low noise. This important layout issue arises due to the chopped nature of the currents flowing in Q1 and D1. If they are both tied directly to the ground plane before being combined, switching noise will be introduced into the ground plane. It is almost impossible to get rid of this noise, once present in the ground plane. The solution is to tie D1’s cathode to the ground pin of the L T3580 before the combined currents are dumped in the ground plane as drawn in Figure 2, Figure 12 and Figure 13. This single layout technique can virtually eliminate high frequency “spike” noise, so often present on switching regulator outputs.\nFigure 8. High Speed “Chopped” Switching Path for Boost TopologyBoard layout also has a significant effect on thermal re-sistance. The exposed package ground pad is the copper plate that runs under the L T3580 die. This is a good thermal path for heat out of the package. Soldering the pad onto the board reduces die temperature and increases the power capability of the L T3580. Provide as much copper area as possible around this pad. Adding multiple feedthroughs around the pad to the ground plane will also help. Figures 9 and 10 show the recommended component placement for the boost and SEPIC configurations, respectively.\nLayout Hints for Inverting Topology\nFigure 11 shows recommended component placement for \nthe dual inductor inverting topology.
