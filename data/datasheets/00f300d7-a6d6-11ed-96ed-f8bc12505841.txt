Accesses begin with the registration of an Active \ncommand, which is then followed by a Read or Write command. The address bits registered coincident with the active \ncommand are used to select the bank and row to be accessed (BA0-BA2 select the bank; A0-A12(x16) or A0-A13(x8) \nselect the row). The address bits registered coincident with the Read or Write command are used to select the starting \ncolumn location A0-A9 for the burst access and to determine if the auto precharge A10 command is to be issued. \nPrior to normal operation, the DDR2 SDRAM must be initialized. The following sections provide detailed information \ncovering device initialization, register definition, command descriptions and device operation.\nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM\nRDQS, RDQSDMa - DMb\nNotes:\n1.

C\n01/04/2022\nIS43/46DR81280C, IS43/46DR16640CSymbol Type Function \nCK, CK Input Clock: CK and CK are differential clock inputs. All address and control input signals \nare sampled on the crossing of the positive edge of CK and negative edge of CK. \nOutput (read) data is referenced to the crossings of CK and CK (both directions of \ncrossing). \nCKE Input Clock Enable: CKE HIGH activates, and CKE LOW deactivates, internal clock signals \nand device input buffers and output drivers. Taking CKE LOW provides Precharge \nPower-Down and Self Refresh operation (all banks idle), or Active Power-Down (row \nActive in any bank). CKE is synchronous for power down entry and exit, and for self \nrefresh entry. CKE is asynchronous for self refresh exit. After VREF has become \nstable during the power on and initialization sequence, it must be maintained for \nproper operation of the CKE receiver. For proper self-refresh entry and exit, VREF \nmust be maintained to this input. CKE must be maintained HIGH throughout read and \nwrite accesses. Input buffers, excluding CK, CK, ODT and CKE are disabled during \npower-down. Input buffers, excluding CKE, are disabled during self refresh.\n CS Input Chip Select: All commands are masked when CS is registered HIGH. CS provides for \nexternal Rank selection on systems with multiple Ranks. CS is considered part of the \ncommand code. \nODT Input On Die Termination:  ODT (registered HIGH) enables termination resistance internal \nto the DDR2 SDRAM.  When enabled, ODT is applied to each DQ, DQS, DQS, DM \nsignals.  The ODT pin will be ignored if the EMR(1) is programmed to disable ODT.\n RAS, CAS, WE Input Command Inputs: RAS, CAS and WE (along with CS) define the command being \nentered. \nDM (x8) or  \nUDM, LDM (x16)  Input Input Data Mask: DM is an input mask signal for write data. Input data is masked \nwhen DM is sampled HIGH coincident with that input data during a Write access. DM \nis sampled on both edges of DQS. Although DM pins are input only, the DM loading \nmatches the DQ and DQS loading. For x8, the function of DM is enabled by EMRS \ncommand to EMR(1) [A11]. \nBA0 - BA2 Input Bank Address Inputs: BA0 - BA2 define to which bank an Active, Read, Write or \nPrecharge command is being applied. Bank address also determines if the mode \nregister or one of the extended mode registers is to be accessed during a MRS or \nEMRS command cycle. \nA0 - A13 Input Address Inputs: Provide the row address for Active commands and the column \naddress and Auto Precharge bit for Read/Write commands to select one location \nout of the memory array in the respective bank. A10 is sampled during a Precharge \ncommand to determine whether the Precharge applies to one bank (A10 LOW) or all \nbanks (A10 HIGH). If only one bank is to be precharged, the bank is selected by BA0 - \nBA2. The address inputs also provide the op-code during MRS or EMRS commands.

The actual current values are \nderived by shifting the desired driver operating point (see Section 3.3 of JESD8-15A) along a 21 Ω load line to define a convenient driver cur -\nrent for measurement.\nOCD Default Characteristics\nDescription Parameter Min Nom Max Unit Notes\nOutput impedance See full strength default \ndriver characteristicsΩ 1\nOutput impedance step size \nfor OCD calibration0 1.5 Ω 6\nPull-up and pull-down \nmismatch0 4Ω 1,2,3\nOutput slew rate Sout 1.5 5 V/ns 1,4,5,7,8,9\nNotes:\n1.  Absolute Specifications (TOPER; VDD = +1.8V ±0.1V, VDDQ = +1.8V ±0.1V). DRAM I/O specifications for timing, voltage, and slew rate are no \nlonger applicable if OCD is changed from default settings.\n2.  Impedance measurement condition for output source dc current: VDDQ = 1.7 V; VOUT = 1420 mV; (VOUTVDDQ)/IOH must be less than 23.4 \nΩ for values of VOUT between VDDQ and VDDQ - 280 mV. Impedance measurement condition for output sink dc current: VDDQ = 1.7 V; \nVOUT = 280 mV; VOUT/IOL must be less than 23.4 Ω for values of VOUT between 0 V and 280 mV.\n3.  Mismatch is absolute value between pull-up and pull-down, both are measured at same temperature and voltage.\n4.  Slew rate measured from VIL(ac) to VIH(ac).\n5.  The absolute value of the slew rate as measured from DC to DC is equal to or greater than the slew rate as measured from AC to AC. This is \nguaranteed by design and characterization.\n6.  This represents the step size when the OCD is near 18 Ω at nominal conditions across all process corners/variations and represents only the \nDRAM uncertainty. A 0 Ω value (no calibration) can only be achieved if the OCD impedance is 18 Ω +/-0.75 Ω under nominal conditions.\n7.  DRAM output slew rate specification applies to 400 MT/s, 533 MT/s, 667 MT/s, and 800 MT/s speed bins.\n8.  Timing skew due to DRAM output slew rate mis-match between DQS / DQS and associated DQ’s is included in tDQSQ and tQHS specification.\n9.  DDR2 SDRAM output slew rate test load is defined in General Note 3 of the AC Timing specification Table.\nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. — www.issi.com 13\nRev.

It is not intended to be either a precise representation of the typical system environment or \na depiction of the actual load presented by a production tester.

Slew Rate Measurement Levels\na) Output slew rate for falling and rising edges is measured between VTT - 250 mV and VTT + 250 mV for single \nended signals. For differential signals (e.g. DQS - DQS) output slew rate is measured between DQS - DQS = - 500 mV \nand DQS - DQS = + 500 mV. Output slew rate is guaranteed by design, but is not necessarily tested on each device.\nb) Input slew rate for single ended signals is measured from Vref(dc) to VIH(ac),min for rising edges and from Vref(dc) \nto VIL(ac),max for falling edges. \nFor differential signals (e.g. CK - CK) slew rate for rising edges is measured from CK - CK = - 250 mV to CK - CK = + \n500 mV (+ 250 mV to - 500 mV for falling edges).\nc) VID is the magnitude of the difference between the input voltage on CK and the input voltage on CK, or between \nDQS and DQS for differential strobe.\n3. DDR2 SDRAM output slew rate test load\nOutput slew rate is characterized under the test conditions as shown in Figure "Slew Rate Test Load".\n4. Differential data strobe\nDDR2 SDRAM pin timings are specified for either single ended mode or differential mode depending on the setting of \nthe EMRS “Enable DQS” mode bit; timing advantages of differential mode are realized in system design. The method \nby which the DDR2 SDRAM pin timings are measured is mode dependent. In single ended mode, timing relationships \nare measured relative to the rising or falling edges of DQS crossing at VREF . In differential mode, these timing \nVDDQ\nDUT\nDQ\nDQ\nRDQS, RDQSS, DQSOutputVTT = VDDQ/2\n25ΩTest point\n Figure - Slew Rate Test Loa d\nrelationships are measured relative to the crosspoint of DQS and its complement, DQS. This distinction in timing \nmethods is guaranteed by design and characterization. Note that when differential data strobe mode is disabled via \nthe EMRS, the complementary pin, DQS, must be tied externally to VSS through a 20 Ω to 10 kΩ resistor to insure \nproper operation.\n22 Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc. — www.issi.com  \nRev.

A minimum of two clocks (2 x tCK or 2 x nCK) is required irrespective of operating frequency.\n5. Timings are specified with command/address input slew rate of 1.0 V/ns.

The maximum limit for this parameter is not a device limit. The device will operate with a greater value for this \nparameter, but system performance (bus turnaround) will degrade accordingly.\n11.  MIN ( tCL, tCH) refers to the smaller of the actual clock LOW time and the actual clock HIGH time as provided to \nthe device (i.e. this value can be greater than the minimum specification limits for tCL and tCH). For example, tCL and \ntCH are = 50% of the period, less the half period jitter ( tJIT(HP)) of the clock source, and less the half period jitter due \nto crosstalk ( tJIT(crosstalk)) into the clock traces.\n12.  tQH = tHP – tQHS, where:\n tHP = minimum half clock period for any given cycle and is defined by clock HIGH or clock LOW (tCH, tCL). tQHS \naccounts for:\n1) The pulse duration distortion of on-chip clock circuits; and\n2) The worst case push-out of DQS on one transition followed by the worst case pull-in of DQ on the next transition, \nboth of which are, separately, due to data pin skew and output pattern effects, and p-channel to n-channel variation of \nthe output drivers.\n13.  tDQSQ: Consists of data pin skew and output pattern effects, and p-channel to n-channel variation of the output \ndrivers as well as output slew rate mismatch between DQS / DQS and associated DQ in any given cycle.\n14.  tDAL = WR + RU{ tRP[ns] / tCK[ns] }, where RU stands for round up.\nWR refers to the tWR parameter stored in the MRS. For tRP , if the result of the division is not already an integer, round \nup to the next highest integer. tCK refers to the application clock period.\nExample: For DDR533 at tCK = 3.75ns with WR programmed to 4 clocks.\ntDAL = 4 + (15 ns / 3.75 ns) clocks = 4 + (4) clocks = 8 clocks.\n15.  The clock frequency is allowed to change during self–refresh mode or precharge power-down mode. In case of \nclock frequency change during precharge power-down, a specific procedure is required as described in section 3.13.\n16.  ODT turn on time min is when the device leaves high impedance and ODT resistance begins to turn on. ODT turn \non time max is when the ODT resistance is fully on. Both are measured from tAOND, which is interpreted differently \nper speed bin. For DDR2-400/533, tAOND is 10 ns (= 2 x 5 ns) after the clock edge that registered a first ODT HIGH \nif tCK = 5 ns. For DDR2-667/800, tAOND is 2 clock cycles after the clock edge that registered a first ODT HIGH \ncounting the actual input clock edges.\n17.  ODT turn off time min is when the device starts to turn off ODT resistance. ODT turn off time max is when \nthe bus is in high impedance. Both are measured from tAOFD, which is interpreted differently per speed bin. For \nDDR2-400/533, tAOFD is 12.5 ns (= 2.5 x 5 ns) after the clock edge that registered a first ODT LOW if tCK = 5 ns. \nFor DDR2-667/800, if tCK(avg) = 3 ns is assumed, tAOFD is 1.5 ns (= 0.5 x 3 ns) after the second trailing clock edge \ncounting from the clock edge that registered a first ODT LOW and by counting the actual input clock edges.\n18.  tHZ and tLZ transitions occur in the same access time as valid data transitions. These parameters are referenced \nto a specific voltage level which specifies when the device output is no longer driving (tHZ), or begins driving (tLZ) . \nOne method to calculate the point when device is no longer driving (tHZ), or begins driving (tLZ) is by measuring the \nsignal at two different voltages. The actual voltage measurement points are not critical as long as the calculation is \nconsistent. tLZ(DQ) refers to tLZ of the DQ’s and tLZ(DQS) refers to tLZ of the (U/L/R)DQS and (U/L/R)DQS each \ntreated as single-ended signal.\n19.  tRPST end point and tRPRE begin point are not referenced to a specific voltage level but specify when the device \noutput is no longer driving (tRPST), or begins driving (tRPRE). One method to calculate these points when the device \nis no longer driving (tRPST), or begins driving (tRPRE) is by measuring the signal at two different voltages.

Input waveform timing with single-ended data strobe enabled, is referenced from the input signal crossing at the \nVIH(ac) level to the single-ended data strobe crossing VIH/L(dc) at the start of its transition for a rising signal, and \nfrom the input signal crossing at the VIL(ac) level to the single-ended data strobe crossing VIH/L(dc) at the start of its \ntransition for a falling signal applied to the device under test. The DQS signal must be monotonic between Vil(dc)max \nand Vih(dc)min.\n26.  Input waveform timing with single-ended data strobe enabled, is referenced from the input signal crossing at the \nVIH(dc) level to the single-ended data strobe crossing VIH/L(ac) at the end of its transition for a rising signal, and \nfrom the input signal crossing at the VIL(dc) level to the single-ended data strobe crossing VIH/L(ac) at the end of its \ntransition for a falling signal applied to the device under test. The DQS signal must be monotonic between Vil(dc)max \nand Vih(dc)min.\n27.  tCKEmin of 3 clocks means CKE must be registered on three consecutive positive clock edges. CKE must remain \nat the valid input level the entire time it takes to achieve the 3 clocks of registration. Thus, after any CKE transition, \nCKE may not transition from its valid level during the time period of tIS + 2 x tCK + tIH.\n28.  If tDS or tDH is violated, data corruption may occur and the data must be re-written with valid data before a valid \nREAD can be executed.\n29.  These parameters are measured from a command/address signal (CKE, CS, RAS, CAS, WE, ODT, BA0, A0, A1, \netc.) transition edge to its respective clock signal (CK/CK) crossing. The spec values are not affected by the amount \nof clock jitter applied (i.e. tJIT(per), tJIT(cc), etc.), as the setup and hold are relative to the clock signal crossing that \nlatches the command/address. That is, these parameters should be met whether clock jitter is present or not.\n30.  These parameters are measured from a data strobe signal ((L/U/R)DQS/DQS) crossing to its respective clock \nsignal (CK/CK) crossing. The spec values are not affected by the amount of clock jitter applied (i.e. tJIT(per), tJIT(cc), \netc.), as these are relative to the clock signal crossing. That is, these parameters should be met whether clock jitter is \npresent or not.\n31.  These parameters are measured from a data signal ((L/U)DM, (L/U)DQ0, (L/U)DQ1, etc.) transition edge to its \nrespective data strobe signal ((L/U/R)DQS/ DQS) crossing.\n32.  For these parameters, the DDR2 SDRAM device is characterized and verified to support tnPARAM = RU{tPARAM \n/ tCK(avg)}, which is in clock cycles, assuming all input clock jitter specifications are satisfied.\nFor example, the device will support tnRP = RU{tRP / tCK(avg)}, which is in clock cycles, if all input clock jitter \nspecifications are met.

It is used in conjunction with tQHS to derive the DRAM output timing tQH.\nThe value to be used for tQH calculation is determined by the following equation;\ntHP = Min ( tCH(abs), tCL(abs) ),\nwhere,\ntCH(abs) is the minimum of the actual instantaneous clock HIGH time;\ntCL(abs) is the minimum of the actual instantaneous clock LOW time;\n38.  tQHS accounts for:\n1) The pulse duration distortion of on-chip clock circuits, which represents how well the actual tHP at the input is \ntransferred to the output; and\n2) The worst case push-out of DQS on one transition followed by the worst case pull-in of DQ on the next transition, \nboth of which are independent of each other, due to data pin skew, output pattern effects, and pchannel to n-channel \nvariation of the output drivers\n39.  tQH = tHP – tQHS, where:\ntHP is the minimum of the absolute half period of the actual input clock; and\ntQHS is the specification value under the max column.\n{The less half-pulse width distortion present, the larger the tQH value is; and the larger the valid data eye will be.}\nExamples:\n1) If the system provides tHP of 1315 ps into a DDR2-667 SDRAM, the DRAM provides tQH of 975 ps minimum.\n2) If the system provides tHP of 1420 ps into a DDR2-667 SDRAM, the DRAM provides tQH of 1080 ps minimum.\n40.  When the device is operated with input clock jitter, this parameter needs to be derated by the actual tERR(6- \n10per) of the input clock.

For tAOFD of DDR2-400/533, the 1/2 clock of tCK in the 2.5 x tCK assumes a tCH, input clock HIGH pulse width \nof 0.5 relative to tCK. tAOF ,min and tAOF ,max should each be derated by the same amount as the actual amount of \ntCH offset present at the DRAM input with respect to 0.5. For example, if an input clock has a worst case tCH of 0.45, \nthe tAOF ,min should be derated by subtracting 0.05 x tCK from it, whereas if an input clock has a worst case tCH of \n0.55, the tAOF ,max should be derated by adding 0.05 x tCK to it. Therefore, we have;\ntAOF ,min(derated) = tAC,min - [0.5 - Min(0.5, tCH,min)] x tCK\ntAOF ,max(derated) = tAC,max + 0.6 + [Max(0.5, tCH,max) - 0.5] x tCK\nor\ntAOF ,min(derated) = Min(tAC,min, tAC,min - [0.5 - tCH,min] x tCK)\ntAOF ,max(derated) = 0.6 + Max(tAC,max, tAC,max + [tCH,max - 0.5] x tCK)\nwhere tCH,min and tCH,max are the minimum and maximum of tCH actually measured at the DRAM input balls.\n45.  For tAOFD of DDR2-667/800, the 1/2 clock of nCK in the 2.5 x nCK assumes a tCH(avg), average input clock \nHIGH pulse width of 0.5 relative to tCK(avg). tAOF ,min and tAOF ,max should each be derated by the same amount \nas the actual amount of tCH(avg) offset present at the DRAM input with respect to 0.5. For example, if an input clock \nhas a worst case tCH(avg) of 0.48, the tAOF ,min should be derated by subtracting 0.02 x tCK(avg) from it, whereas \nif an input clock has a worst case tCH(avg) of 0.52, the tAOF ,max should be derated by adding 0.02 x tCK(avg) to it. \nTherefore, we have;\ntAOF ,min(derated) = tAC,min - [0.5 - Min(0.5, tCH(avg),min)] x tCK(avg)\ntAOF ,max(derated) = tAC,max + 0.6 + [Max(0.5, tCH(avg),max) - 0.5] x tCK(avg)\nor\ntAOF ,min(derated) = Min(tAC,min, tAC,min - [0.5 - tCH(avg),min] x tCK(avg))\ntAOF ,max(derated) = 0.6 + Max(tAC,max, tAC,max + [tCH(avg),max - 0.5] x tCK(avg))\nwhere tCH(avg),min and tCH(avg),max are the minimum and maximum of tCH(avg) actually measured at the DRAM \ninput balls.\nNote that these deratings are in addition to the tAOF derating per input clock jitter, i.e. tJIT(duty) and tERR(6-10per). \nHowever tAC values used in the equations shown above are from the timing parameter table and are not derated. \n32 Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc. — www.issi.com  \nRev.

Operational procedures other than those \nspecified may result in undefined operation. For DDR2 SDRAMs, both bits BA0 and BA1 must be decoded for Mode/\nExtended Mode Register Set (MRS/EMRS) commands. Users must initialize all four Mode Registers. The registers \nmay be initialized in any order.\nPower-up and Initialization Sequence\nThe following sequence is required for Power-up and Initialization.\na) Either one of the following sequence is required for Power-up.\na1) While applying power, attempt to maintain CKE below 0.2 x VDDQ and ODT*1 at a LOW state (all other \ninputs may be undefined.) The VDD voltage ramp time must be no greater than 200 ms from when VDD ramps \nfrom 300 mV to VDD min; and during the VDD voltage ramp, |VDD-VDDQ| ≤ 0.3 volts. Once the ramping of the \nsupply voltages is complete (when VDDQ crosses VDDQ min), the supply voltage specifications provided in \n"Recommended DC operating conditions" (SSTL_1.8), prevail.\n - VDD, VDDL and VDDQ are driven from a single power converter output, AND\n - VTT is limited to 0.95V max, AND\n - VREF tracks VDDQ/2, VREF must be within +/- 300mV with respect to VDDQ/2 during supply ramp time.\n - VDDQ ≥ VREF must be met at all times.\na2) While applying power, attempt to maintain CKE below 0.2 x VDDQ and ODT*1 at a LOW state, all other inputs \nmay be undefined, voltage levels at I/Os and outputs must be less than VDDQ during voltage ramp time to avoid \nDRAM latch-up. During the ramping of the supply voltages, VDD ≥ VDDL ≥ VDDQ must be maintained and is \napplicable to both AC and DC levels until the ramping of the supply voltages is complete, which is when VDDQ \ncrosses VDDQ min. Once the ramping of the supply voltages is complete, the supply voltage specifications provided \nin "Recommended DC operating conditions" (SSTL_1.8), prevail.\n- Apply VDD/VDDL before or at the same time as VDDQ.\n- VDD/VDDL voltage ramp time must be no greater than 200ms from when VDD ramps from 300mV to VDD min\n- Apply VDDQ before or at the same time as VTT.\n- The VDDQ voltage ramp time from when VDD min is achieved on VDD to when VDDQ min is achieved on VDDQ \nmust be no greater than 500ms.  \n(Note: While VDD is ramping, current may be supplied from VDD through the DRAM to VDDQ.)\n- VREF must track VDDQ/2, VREF must be within +/- 300mv with respect to VDDQ/2 during supply ramp time.Thus the final derated values for tAOF are;\ntAOF ,min(derated_final) = tAOF ,min(derated) + { - tJIT(duty),max - tERR(6-10per),max }\ntAOF ,max(derated_final) = tAOF ,max(derated) + { - tJIT(duty),min - tERR(6-10per),min }\n46.

Additionally, DLL disable \nfunction, driver impedance, additive CAS latency, ODT (On Die Termination), single-ended strobe, and OCD (off chip \ndriver impedance adjustment) are also user defined variables and must be programmed with an Extended Mode \nRegister Set (EMRS) command. Contents of the Mode Register or Extended Mode Registers can be altered by re-\nexecuting the MRS or EMRS Commands. Even if the user chooses to modify only a subset of the MR, or EMR(1), \nEMR(2), or EMR(3) variables, all variables within the addressed register must be redefined when the MRS or EMRS \ncommands are issued.\nMRS, EMRS and Reset DLL do not affect memory array contents, which means re-initialization including those can be \nexecuted at any time after power-up without affecting memory array contents.\nMode Register (MR) \nThe mode register stores the data for controlling the various operating modes of the DDR2 SDRAM. It controls CAS \nlatency, burst length, burst sequence, test mode, DLL reset, and Write Recovery time (WR) to make DDR2 SDRAM \nuseful for various applications. The default value of the mode register is not defined, therefore the mode register \nmust be programmed during initialization for proper operation. The mode register is written by asserting LOW on \nCS, RAS, CAS, WE, BA0, BA1 and BA2, while controlling the state of address pins A0-A13(x8) or A0-A12(x16). The \nDDR2 SDRAM should be in all bank precharge state with CKE already HIGH prior to writing into the mode register. \nThe mode register set command cycle time (tMRD) is required to complete the write operation to the mode register. \nThe mode register contents can be changed using the same command and clock cycle requirements during normal \noperation as long as all banks are in the precharge state. The mode register is divided into various fields depending on \nfunctionality. Burst length is defined by A0 - A2 with options of 4 and 8 bit burst lengths. The burst length decodes are \ncompatible with DDR SDRAM. Burst address sequence type is defined by A3, CAS latency is defined by A4 - A6. The \nDDR2 does not support half clock latency mode. A7 is a mode bit and must be set to LOW for normal MRS operation. \nA8 is used for DLL reset. Write recovery time WR is defined by A9 - A11.

For DDR2-400/533, WR (write recovery for autoprecharge) min is determined by tCK max and WR max is determined by tCK min. WR in clock \ncycles is calculated by dividing tWR (in ns) by tCK (in ns) and rounding up to the next integer (WR[cycles] = RU{ tWR[ns] / tCK[ns] }, where RU \nstands for round up). For DDR2-667/800, WR min is determined by tCK(avg) max and WR max is determined by tCK(avg) min. WR[cycles] = \nRU{ tWR[ns] / tCK(avg)[ns] }, where RU stands for round up. The mode register must be programmed to this value. This is also used with tRP \nto determine tDAL.\n2.  Speed bin determined. Refer to Key Timing Parameter table.\n3.

The parameters that define how the burst mode will operate are burst sequence and burst \nlength. DDR2 SDRAM supports 4 bit burst and 8 bit burst modes only. For 8 bit burst mode, full interleave address \nordering is supported, however, sequential address ordering is nibble based for ease of implementation. The burst \ntype, either sequential or interleaved, is programmable and defined by MR[A3], which is similar to the DDR SDRAM \noperation. Seamless burst read or write operations are supported. Unlike DDR devices, interruption of a burst read or \nwrite cycle during BL = 4 mode operation is prohibited. However in case of BL = 8 mode, interruption of a burst read or \nwrite operation is limited to two cases, reads interrupted by a read, or writes interrupted by a write.

The EMR(1) is written by asserting LOW \non CS, RAS, CAS, WE, HIGH on BA0 and LOW on BA1 and BA2, while controlling the states of address pins A0 - \nA13. The DDR2 SDRAM should be in all bank precharge with CKE already HIGH prior to writing into the extended \nmode register. The mode register set command cycle time (tMRD) must be satisfied to complete the write operation \nto the extended mode register. Mode register contents can be changed using the same command and clock cycle \nrequirements during normal operation as long as all banks are in the precharge state. \nDLL enable/disable\nThe DLL must be enabled for normal operation. DLL enable is required during power-up and initialization, and upon \nreturning to normal operation after having the DLL disabled. The DLL is automatically disabled when entering self \nrefresh operation and is automatically re-enabled upon exit of self refresh operation. Any time the DLL is enabled (and \nsubsequently reset), 200 clock cycles must occur before a Read command can be issued to allow time for the internal \nclock to be synchronized with the external clock. Failing to wait for synchronization to occur may result in a violation of \nthe tAC or tDQSCK parameters.\n38 Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc. — www.issi.com  \nRev.

The EMR(2) is written \nby asserting LOW on CS, RAS, CAS, WE, HIGH on BA1 and LOW on BA0 and BA2, while controlling the states \nof address pins A0 - A13. The DDR2 SDRAM should be in all bank precharge state with CKE already HIGH prior \nto writing into the EMR(2).

C\n01/04/2022\nIS43/46DR81280C, IS43/46DR16640CDESELECT\nThe DESELECT function (CS HIGH) prevents new commands from being executed by the DDR2 SDRAM. The DDR2 \nSDRAM is effectively deselected. Operations already in progress are not affected. DESELECT is also referred to as \nCOMMAND INHIBIT.\nNO OPERATION (NOP)\nThe NO OPERATION (NOP) command is used to instruct the selected DDR2 SDRAM to perform a NOP (CS is LOW; \nRAS, CAS, and WE are HIGH). This prevents unwanted commands from being registered during idle or wait states. \nOperations already in progress are not affected.\nMODE REGISTER SET (MRS or EMRS)\nThe mode registers are loaded via bank address and address inputs. The bank address balls determine which mode \nregister will be programmed. See sections on Mode Register and Extended Mode Register. The MRS and EMRS \ncommands can only be issued when all banks are idle, and a subsequent executable command cannot be issued until \ntMRD is met.\nACTIVATE\nThe ACTIVATE command is used to open (or activate) a row in a particular bank for a subsequent access. The value \non the bank address inputs determines the bank, and the address inputs select the row. This row remains active (or \nopen) for accesses until a PRECHARGE command is issued to that bank. A PRECHARGE command must be issued \nbefore opening a different row in the same bank.\nREAD\nThe READ command is used to initiate a burst read access to an active row. The value on the bank address inputs \ndetermine the bank, and the address provided on address inputs A0–A9 selects the starting column location. The \nvalue on input A10 determines whether or not auto precharge is used. If auto precharge is selected, the row being \naccessed will be precharged at the end of the READ burst; if auto precharge is not selected, the row will remain open \nfor subsequent accesses. \nDDR2 SDRAM also supports the AL feature, which allows a READ or WRITE command to be issued prior to tRCD \n(MIN) by delaying the actual registration of the READ/WRITE command to the internal device by AL clock cycles.\nWRITE\nThe WRITE command is used to initiate a burst write access to an active row. The value on the bank select inputs \nselects the bank, and the address provided on inputs A0–A9 selects the starting column location. The value on input \nA10 determines whether or not auto precharge is used. If auto precharge is selected, the row being accessed will be \nprecharged at the end of the WRITE burst; if auto precharge is not selected, the row will remain open for subsequent \naccesses. \nDDR2 SDRAM also supports the AL feature, which allows a READ or WRITE command to be issued prior to tRCD \n(MIN) by delaying the actual registration of the READ/WRITE command to the internal device by AL clock cycles. \nInput data appearing on the DQ is written to the memory array subject to the DM input logic level appearing coincident \nwith the data. If a given DM signal is registered LOW, the corresponding data will be written to memory; if the DM \nsignal is registered HIGH, the corresponding data inputs will be ignored, and a WRITE will not be executed to that \nbyte/column location.\n44 Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc. — www.issi.com  \nRev. C\n01/04/2022\nIS43/46DR81280C, IS43/46DR16640CPRECHARGE\nThe PRECHARGE command is used to deactivate the open row in a particular bank or the open row in all banks. \nThe bank(s) will be available for a subsequent row activation a specified time (tRP) after the PRECHARGE command \nis issued, except in the case of concurrent auto precharge, where a READ or WRITE command to a different bank \nis allowed as long as it does not interrupt the data transfer in the current bank and does not violate any other timing \nparameters. After a bank has been precharged, it is in the idle state and must be activated prior to any READ or \nWRITE commands being issued to that bank. A PRECHARGE command is allowed if there is no open row in that \nbank (idle state) or if the previously open row is already in the process of precharging. However, the precharge period \nwill be determined by the last PRECHARGE command issued to the bank.\nREFRESH\nREFRESH is used during normal operation of the DDR2 SDRAM and is analogous to CAS-before-RAS (CBR) \nREFRESH. All banks must be in the idle mode prior to issuing a REFRESH command. This command is \nnonpersistent, so it must be issued each time a refresh is required. The addressing is generated by the internal refresh \ncontroller. This makes the address bits a “Don’t Care” during a REFRESH command.  \n \nFlexibility is provided for the absolute refresh interval. A maximum of 8 Refresh commands can be posted to the \nDRAM, meaning that the maximum absolute interval between any Refresh command and the next Refresh command \nis 9x tREFI.\n \nSELF REFRESH\nThe SELF REFRESH command can be used to retain data in the DDR2 SDRAM, even if the rest of the system is \npowered down. When in the self refresh mode, the DDR2 SDRAM retains data without external clocking. All power \nsupply inputs (including VREF) must be maintained at valid levels upon entry/exit and during SELF REFRESH \noperation.\nThe SELF REFRESH command is initiated like a REFRESH command except CKE is LOW. The DLL is automatically \ndisabled upon entering self refresh and is automatically enabled upon exiting self refresh.\nODT (On-Die Termination)\nThe On-Die Termination feature allows the DDR2 SDRAM to easily implement a termination resistance (Rtt) for each \nDQ, DQS, DQS, RDQS, and RDQS signal.  The ODT feature can be configured with the Extended Mode Register Set \n(EMRS) command, and turned on or off using the ODT input signal.  Before and after the EMRS is issued, the ODT \ninput must be received with respect to the timings of tAOFD, tMOD(max), tAOND; and the CKE input must be held \nHIGH throughout the duration of tMOD(max).\nThe DDR2 SDRAM supports the ODT on and off functionality in Active, Standby, and Power Down modes, but not in \nSelf Refresh mode.  ODT timing diagrams follow for Active/Standby mode and Power Down mode.\nEMRS to ODT Update Delay\nEMRS\nCKCKCMD NOP NOP NOP NOP NOP\nODT\ntMOD,max\ntMOD,min\nOld setting ODT Read yU pdate d RtttAOFDtIS\ntAOND\nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. — www.issi.com 45\nRev.
