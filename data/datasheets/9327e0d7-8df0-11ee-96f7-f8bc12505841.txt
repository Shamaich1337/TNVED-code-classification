GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS  \nThe W 25Q16JV  (16M -bit) Serial Flash memory provides a storage solution for systems with limited space, \npins and power. The 25Q series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash devices. \nThey are ideal for code shadowing to RAM,  executing code  directly from D ual/Quad SPI  (XIP)  and storing \nvoice, text and data. The device operates on a single 2.7V to 3.6V power supply with current consumption \nas low as 1µA for power -down.  \nThe W 25Q16JV  array is organized into 8,192 programmable pages of 256 -bytes each. Up to 256 bytes can \nbe programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in groups of 16 (4KB sector erase), groups of 128 (32KB \nblock erase), groups of 256 (64KB block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The W 25Q16JV  has 512 \nerasable sectors and 32 er asable blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for greater flexibility in \napplications that require data and parameter storage. (See figure 2.)  \nThe W25Q16 JV supports the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), and a high performance Dual/Quad  \noutput as well as Dual/Quad I/O SPI: Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data I/O0 (DI), I/O1 (DO), I/O2, and \nI/O3. SPI clock frequencies of up to  133MHz are supported allowing equivalent clock rates of 266MHz \n(133MHz  x 2) for Dual I/O and 532MHz (133MHz x 4) for Quad I/O when using the Fast Read Dual/Quad \nI/O instructions. These transfer rates can outperform standard Asynchronous 8 and 16 -bit Parallel Flash \nmemories.  \nAdditionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device ID and SFDP Regis ter, a 64 -\nbit Unique Serial Number and three 256 -bytes Security Registers.  \n2.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \n4.1 Chip Select (/CS)  \nThe SPI Chip Select (/CS) pin enables and disables device operation. When /CS  is high the device is \ndeselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3) pins are at high impedance. When \ndeselected, the devices power consumpti on will be at standby levels unless an internal erase, program or \nwrite status register cycle is in progress. When /CS  is brought low the device will be selected, power \nconsumption will increase to active levels and instructions can be written to and data read from the device. \nAfter power -up, /CS  must transition from high to low before a new instruction will be accepted. The /CS \ninput must track the VCC supply level at power -up and power -down (see “Write Protection” and Figure 58). \nIf needed a pull -up resis ter on the /CS pin can be used to accomplish this.  \n4.2 Serial Data Input, Output and IOs (DI, DO and IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3)   \nThe W25Q16 JV supports standard SPI, Dual SPI and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI instructions use \nthe unidirectional DI (input) pin to se rially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising \nedge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidirectional DO (output) to read data \nor status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \nDual and Quad SPI i nstructions use the bidirectional IO pins to serially write instructions, addresses or data \nto the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK. \nQuad SPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad Enab le bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set. When \nQE=1, the /WP pin becomes IO2 and the /HOLD pin becomes IO3.  \n  \n4.3 Write Protect (/WP)  \nThe Write Protect (/WP) pin can be used to prevent the Status Register from being written. Used in \nconjunction with the Sta tus Register’s Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0) bits and Status \nRegister Protect (SRP) bits, a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire memory array can be hardware \nprotected. The /WP pin is active low.  \n4.4 HOLD (/HOLD)  \nThe /HOLD pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. When /HOLD is brought low, \nwhile /CS is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals on the DI and CLK pins will be ignored \n(don’t care). When /HOLD is brought high, device operation ca n resume. The /HOLD function can be useful \nwhen multiple devices are sharing the same SPI signals. The /HOLD pin is active low. When the QE bit of \nStatus Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, the /HOLD pin function is not available since this pin is used for IO3 . \nSee Figure 1a -c for the pin configuration of Quad I/O operation.  \n4.5 Serial Clock (CLK)  \nThe SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and output operations. ("See SPI \nOperations")  \n4.1 Reset (/RESET)(1) \nA dedicated hardware /RESET pin is available on SOIC -16 and TFBGA packages. When it’s driven low for \na minimum period of ~1µS, this device will terminate any external or internal operations and return to its \npower -on state.  \nNote:  \n1. Hardware /RESET pin is available on SOIC -16 or TFBGA; ple ase contact Winbond for this package.  \n \nW25 Q16JV\n \nPublication Release Date:  March 22, 2018, 2018  \n- 8 -                                  Revision G  \n5. BLOCK DIAGRAM  \nFigure 2. W25 Q16JV  Serial Flash Memory Block Diagram  \n\nW25 Q16JV\n \n \n- 9 - \n6. FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ONS  \n6.1 Standard SPI Instructions  \nThe W25 Q16JV  is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial Clock (CLK), \nChip Select (/CS), Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard SPI instructions use the DI \ninput pin to serially write instructions, addresses or da ta to the device on the rising edge of CLK. The DO \noutput pin is used to read data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 and \nMode 3 concerns th e normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and data is not \nbeing transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0, the CLK signal is normally low on the falling and rising \nedges of /CS. For Mode 3, the CLK signal is normally high on the falling and rising edges of /CS.  \n6.2 Dual SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q16 JV supports Dual SPI operation when using instructions such as “Fast Read Dual Output \n(3Bh)” and “Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh)”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from t he device \nat two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices. The Dual SPI Read instructions are ideal for \nquickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -shadowing) or for executing non -speed -critical \ncode directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Dual SPI instructions, the DI and DO pins become \nbidirectional I/O pins: IO0 and IO1.  \n6.1 Quad SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q16 JV supports Quad  SPI operation when using instructions such as “Fast Read Quad  Output \n(6Bh)”,  and “Fast Read Quad  I/O (EBh). T hese instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the device \nfour to six times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash. When using Quad SPI instructions, the DI and DO pins \nbecome bidirectional IO0 and IO1, with the additional I/O pins: IO2, IO3.  \n6.2 Softwa re Reset & Hardware /RESET pin  \nThe W25Q16 JV can be reset to the initial power -on state by a software Reset sequence. This sequence \nmust include two consecutive instructions: Enable Reset (66h) & Reset (99h). If the instruction sequence \nis successfully acce pted, the device will take approximately 30 µS (tRST) to reset. No instruction will be \naccepted during the reset period. For the SOIC -16 and TFBGA packages, W25Q16 JV provides a dedicated \nhardware /RESET pin. Drive the /RESET pin low for a minimum period of ~1µS (tRESET*) will interrupt any \non-going external/internal operations  and reset the device to its initial power -on state. Hardware /RESET \npin has higher priority than other SPI input signals (/CS, CLK, IOs).  \n \nNote:  \n1. Hardware /RESET pin is available on SOIC-16 or TFBGA ; please contact Winbond for his package . \n2. While a faster /RESET pulse (as short as a few hundred nanoseconds) will often reset the device, a 1us minimum is recommended  \nto ensure reliable operation.  \n3. There is an internal pull -up resistor for th e dedicated /RESET pin on the SOIC -16 package. If the reset function is not needed, \nthis pin can be left floating in the system . \n \n \nW25 Q16JV\n \nPublication Release Date:  March 22, 2018, 2018  \n- 10 -                                  Revision G  \n6.3 Write Protection  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise and other \nadverse system conditions that may compromise data integrity. To address this concern, the W25 Q16JV  \nprovides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n6.4 Write Protect Features  \n\uf0b7 Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n\uf0b7 Time delay write disable after Power -up \n\uf0b7 Write enable/disable instructions and automatic write disable after erase or program  \n\uf0b7 Software and Hardware (/WP pin) write protection using Status Registers  \n\uf0b7 Additional Individual Block/Sector Locks for array protection  \n\uf0b7 Write Protecti on using Power -down instruction  \n\uf0b7 Lock Down write protection for Status Register until the next power -up \n\uf0b7 One Time Program (OTP) write protection for array and Security Registers using Status Register* \n* Note:  This feature is available upon special order. Pl ease contact Winbond for details.  \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down, the W25 Q16JV  will maintain a reset condition while VCC is below the \nthreshold value of V WI, (See Power -up Timing and Voltage Levels and Figure 43). While reset, all \noperations are disabled and no instructions are recognized. During power -up and after the VCC voltage \nexceeds V WI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled for a time delay of t PUW. This \nincludes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Ch ip Erase and the Write Status \nRegister instructions. Note that the chip select pin (/CS) must track the VCC supply level at power -up until \nthe VCC -min level and t VSL time delay is reached, and it must also track the VCC supply level at power -\ndown to preven t adverse command sequence. If needed a pull -up resister on /CS can be used to \naccomplish this.  \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Status Register Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Write Enable instru ction must be issued before a Page Program, Sector \nErase, Block Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction will be accepted. After completing a \nprogram, erase or write instruction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is automatically cleared to a write -disabled \nstate of 0.  \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instruction and setting the \nStatus Register Protect (SRP , SRL ) and Block Protect (CMP , TB, BP[ 2:0]) bits. These settings allow a \nportion or the entire  memory array to be configured as read only. Used in conjunction with the Write Protect \n(/WP) pin, changes to the Status Register can be enabled or disabled under hardware control. See Status \nRegister section for further information. Additionally, the Powe r-down instruction offers an extra level of \nwrite protection as all instructions are ignored except for the Release Power -down instruction.  \n \nThe W25 Q16JV  also provides another Write Protect method using the Individual Block Locks. Each 64KB \nblock (except t he top and bottom blocks, total of 30 blocks) and each 4KB sector within the top/bottom \nblocks (total of 32 sectors) are equipped with an Individual Block Lock bit. When the lock bit is 0, the \ncorresponding sector or block can be erased or programmed; when  the lock bit is set to 1, Erase or Program \ncommands issued to the corresponding sector or block will be ignored. When the device is powered on, all \nIndividual Block Lock bits will be 1, so the entire memory array is protected from Erase/Program. An \n“Indiv idual Block Unlock (39h)” instruction must be issued to unlock any specific sector or block.  \nThe WPS bit in Status Register -3 is used to decide which Write Protect scheme should be used. When \nWPS=0 (factory default), the device will only utilize CMP, SEC, TB, BP[2:0] bits to protect specific areas of \nthe array; when WPS=1, the device will utilize the Individual Block Locks for write protection.  \nW25 Q16JV\n \n \n- 11 - \n7. STATUS AND CONFIGURA TION REGISTERS  \nThree Status and Configuration Registers are provided for W25 Q16J V. The Read Status Register -1/2/3 \ninstructions can be used to provide status on the availability of the flash memory array, whether the \ndevice is write enabled or disabled, the state of write protection, Quad SPI setting, Security Register lock \nstatus, Erase/Program S uspend status,  and output driver strength. The Write Status Register instruction \ncan be used to configure the device write protection features, Quad SPI setting, Security Register OTP \nlocks,  and output driver strength. Write access to the Status Register i s controlled by the state of the  non-\nvolatile Status Register Protect bits ( SRL), the Write Enable instruction, and durin g Standard/Dual SPI \noperations.  \n7.1 Status Registers  \n \nFigure 4 a. Status Register -1 \n Erase/Write In Progress (BUSY) – Status Only  \nBUSY is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is executing a \nPage Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase,  Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register or \nErase/Program Security Register instruction. During this time the device will ignore further instructions \nexcept for the Read Status Register and Erase/Program Suspend instruction (see t W, tPP, tSE, tBE, and tCE \nin AC Characteristics). When the program, erase or write status/security register instruction has completed, \nthe BUSY bit will be cleared to a 0 state indicating the device is ready for further instructions.   \n Write Enable Latch (WEL) – Status Only  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the status register (S1) that is set to 1 after executing a Write \nEnable Instruction. The WEL status bit is cleared to 0 when the device is write disabled. A write disable \nstate occurs upon power -up or after an y of the following instructions: Write Disable, Page Program, Quad \nPage Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register, Erase Security Register and \nProgram Security Register.  \n Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) – Volatile/Non -Volatile  Writable  \nThe Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register (S4, S3, and \nS2) that provide Write Protection control and status. Block Protect bits can be set using the Write Status \nRegister Instruction (see t W in AC characteristics). All, none or a portion of the memory array can be \nprotected from Program and Erase instructions (see Status Register Memory Protection table). The factory \ndefault setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of the array protected .  \nSRP \nSEC \nTB \nBP \n2 \nBP \n1 \nBP \n0 \nWEL \nBUSY \nTOP/BOTTOM PROTECT  \nWRITE ENABLE LATCH  \n  \nS \n7 \nS \n6 \nS \n5 \nS \n4 \nS \n3 \nS \n2 \nS \n1 \nS \n0 \nSTATUS REGISTER PROTECT  \nSECTOR PROTECT  \nBLOCK PROTECT BITS  \nWRITE IN PROGRESS  \n(volatile/non -volatile)  \n(volatile/non -volatile ) \n(volatile/non -volatile ) \n(volatile/non -volatile ) \nW25 Q16JV\n \nPublication Release Date:  March 22, 2018, 2018  \n- 12 -                                  Revision G  \n Top/Bottom Block Protect  (TB) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe non -volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect from the Top \n(TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in the Status Register Memory P rotection table. The \nfactory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the Write Status Register Instruction depending \non the state of the SRL and WEL bits.  \n Sector /Block  Protect Bit (SEC)  – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe non -volatile Sector /Block  Protect bit (SEC)  controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect \neither 4KB Sectors (SEC=1) or 64KB Blocks (SEC=0) in the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array \nas shown in the Status Register Memory Protection table. The  default s etting is SEC=0. \n Complement Protect (CMP) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S14). It is used in \nconjunction with SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits to provide more flexibi lity for the array protection. Once \nCMP is set to 1, previous array protection set by SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 will be reversed. For instance, \nwhen CMP=0, a top 64KB block can be protected while the rest of the array is not; when CMP=1, the top \n64KB block  will become unprotected while the rest of the array become read -only. Please refer to the Status \nRegister Memory Protection table for details. The  default setting is CMP =0. \n  \nW25 Q16JV\n \n \n- 13 - \n Status Register Protect  SRP, SRL) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThree Status and Configuration Registers are provided for W25Q16 JV.

The SUS status bit is cleared to 0 by Erase/Program Resume \n(7Ah) instruction as well as a power -down, power -up cycle.  \n Security Register Lock  Bits (LB3, LB2, LB1) –Non-Volatile OTP Writable  \nThe Security R egister Lock Bits (LB3, LB2, LB1) are non -volatile One Time Program (OTP) bits in Status \nRegister (S13, S12, S11) that provide the write protect control and status to the Security Registers. The \ndefault state of LB3 -1 is 0, Security Registers are unlocked.  LB3-1 can be set to 1 individually using the \nWrite Status Register instruction. LB3 -1 are One Time Programmable (OTP), once it’s set to 1, the \ncorresponding 256 -Byte Security Register will become read -only permanently.  \n8. QUAD ENABLE  (QE) – Volatile/Non -Vola tile Writable  \nThe Quad Enable (QE ) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S 9) that enables Quad SPI \noperation . When the QE bit is set to a 0 state (factory default  for part numbers with ordering options “IM”  & \n“JM”), the /HOLD are enabled, the device operates in Standard/Dual SPI modes . When the QE bit is set to \na 1 (factory fixed default  for part numbers with ordering options “IQ”  &”JQ” ), the  Quad IO2 and IO3 pins are \nenabled, and /HOLD function is disabled, the device operates in Standard/Dual/Quad SPI modes.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nS \n  \n15 \n  \nS \n  \n14 \n  \nS \n  \n13 \n  \nS \n  \n12 \n  \nS \n  \n11 \n  \nS \n  \n10 \n  \nS \n  \n9 \n  \nS \n  \n8 \n  \nSUS \n  \nCMP \n  \nLB \n  \n3 \n  \nLB \n  \n2 \n  \nLB \n  \n1 \n  \n( \n  \nR \n  \n) \n  \nQE \n  \nSR \nL \n  \n  \nS \ntatus Register Lock  \n  \n  \n( \n  \nVolatile \n  \n/ \n  \nNon \n  \n- \n  \nVolatile Writable  \n  \n) \n  \nComplement Protect  \n  \n( \n  \nVolatile \n  \n/ \n  \nNon \n  \n- \n  \nVolatile Writable  \n  \n) \n  \nSecurity Register Lock Bits  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n(Non -Volatile OTP Writable)  \n  \n  \nReserved  \n  \nQuad Enable  \n  \n( \n  \nVolatile \n  \n/ \n  \nNon \n  \n- \n  \nVolatile Writable  \n  \n) \n  \nSuspend Status  \n  \n( \n  \nStatus \n  \n- \n  \nOnly \n  \n) \n  \nW25 Q16JV\n \n \n- 15 - \n \nFigure 4 c.

INSTRUCTIONS  \nThe Standard/Dual/Quad SPI instruction set of the W25 Q16JV  consists of 48 basic instructions that are \nfully controlled through the SPI bus (see Instruction Set Table1 -2). Instructions are initiated with the falling \nedge of Chip Select (/CS). The first byte of data clocked into the DI input provides the instruction code. \nData on  the DI input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with most significant bit (MSB) first.  \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address bytes, data \nbytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a com bination. Instructions are completed with the \nrising edge of edge /CS. Clock relative timing diagrams for each instruction are included in Figures 5 through \n57. All read instructions can be completed after any clocked bit. However, all instructions that Wr ite, \nProgram or Erase must complete on a byte boundary (/CS driven high after a full 8 -bits have been clocked) \notherwise the instruction will be ignored. This feature further protects the device from inadvertent writes. \nAdditionally, while the memory is be ing programmed or erased, or when the Status Register is being written, \nall instructions except for Read Status Register will be ignored until the program or erase cycle has \ncompleted.  \n9.1 Device ID and Instruction Set Tables  \n Manufacturer and Device Identifica tion \nMANUFACTURER ID  (MF7 - MF0)   \nWinbond Serial Flash  EFh \n \nDevice ID  (ID7 - ID0) (ID15 - ID0) \nInstruction   ABh, 90h, 92h, 94h  9Fh \nW25Q16JV -IQ/JQ  14h 4015h \nW25Q16JV -IM*/JM* 14h 7015h  \nNote: For DTR, QPI supporting, please refer to W25Q 16JV DTR  datasheet.  \n \nW25 Q16JV\n \nPublication Release Date:  March 22, 2018, 2018  \n- 20 -                                  Revision G  \n Instruction Set Table 1 (Standard SPI Instructions)  (1) \nData Input Output  Byte 1  Byte 2  Byte 3  Byte 4  Byte 5  Byte 6  Byte 7  \nNumber  of Clock (1-1-1) 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \nWrite Enable  06h  \nVolatile SR Write Enable  50h  \nWrite Disable  04h  \nRelease Power -down / ID  ABh Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  (ID7-ID0)(2)  \nManufacturer/Device ID  90h Dummy  Dummy  00h (MF7 -MF0)  (ID7-ID0)  \nJEDEC ID  9Fh (MF7 -MF0)  (ID15 -ID8) (ID7-ID0)  \nRead Unique ID  4Bh Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  (UID63 -0)  \nRead Data  03h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 (D7-D0)  \nFast Read  0Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy  (D7-D0)  \nPage Program  02h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0 D7-D0(3)  \nSector Erase (4KB)  20h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nBlock Erase (32KB)  52h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nBlock Erase (64KB)  D8h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nChip Erase  C7h/60h  \nRead Status Register -1 05h (S7-S0)(2)  \nWrite Status Register -1(4) 01h (S7-S0)(4)  \nRead Status Register -2 35h (S15 -S8)(2)  \nWrite Status Register -2 31h (S15 -S8)  \nRead Status Register -3 15h (S23 -S16)(2)  \nWrite Status Register -3 11h (S23 -S16)   \nRead SFDP Register  5Ah 00 00 A7-A0 Dummy  (D7-D0)  \nErase Security Register(5) 44h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nProgram Security Register(5) 42h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0(3)   \nRead Security Register(5) 48h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy  (D7-D0)  \nGlobal Block Lock  7Eh  \nGlobal Block Unlock  98h  \nRead Block Lock  3Dh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 (L7-L0)  \nIndividual Block Lock  36h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nIndividual Block Unlock  39h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nErase / Program Suspend  75h  \nErase / Program Resume  7Ah  \nPower -down  B9h  \nEnable Reset  66h  \nReset Device  99h  \n  \nW25 Q16JV\n \n \n- 21 - \n Instruction Set Table 2 (Dual/Quad SPI Instructions)(1) \nData Input Output  Byte 1  Byte 2  Byte 3  Byte 4  Byte 5  Byte 6  Byte 7  Byte 8  Byte 9 \nNumber of Clock (1-1-2) 8 8 8 8 4 4 4 4 4 \nFast Read Dual Output  3Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy  Dummy  (D7-D0)(7)  \nNumber of Clock (1-2-2) 8 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 \nFast Read Dual I/O  BBh A23-A16(6) A15-A8(6) A7-A0(6) Dummy(11) (D7-D0)(7)  \nMftr./Device ID Dual I/O  92h A23-A16(6) A15-A8(6) 00(6) Dummy(11) (MF7 -MF0)  (ID7-ID0)(7)  \nNumber of Clock (1-1-4) 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 \nQuad Input Page Program  32h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 (D7-D0)(9) (D7-D0)(3) … \nFast Read Quad Output  6Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  (D7-D0)(10) \nNumber of Clock (1-4-4) 8 2(8) 2(8) 2(8) 2 2 2 2 2 \nMftr./Device ID Quad I/O  94h A23-A16 A15-A8 00 Dummy(11) Dummy  Dummy  (MF7 -MF0)  (ID7-ID0) \nFast Read Quad I/O  EBh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 Dummy(11) Dummy  Dummy  (D7-D0)  \nSet Burst with Wrap  77h Dummy  Dummy  Dummy  W8-W0  \n \nNotes:  \n1.

The Write Enable \ninstruction is entered by driving /CS low, shifting the instruction code “06h” into the Data Input (DI) pin on \nthe rising edge of CLK, and then driving /CS high.  \n  \nFigure 5. Write Enable Instruction  \n Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h)  \nThe non-volatile Status Register bits described in section 7.1 can also be written to as volatile bits. This \ngives more flexibility to change the system configuration and memory protection schemes quickly without \nwaiting for the typical non -volatile bit write cycles or affecting the endurance of the Status Register non -\nvolatile bits. To write the volatile values into the Status Register bits, the Write Enable for Volatile Status \nRegister (50h) instruction must be issued prior to a Write Status Register (01h) in struction. Write Enable for \nVolatile Status Register instruction (Figure 6) will not set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit, it is only valid \nfor the Write Status Register instruction to change the volatile Status Register bit values.  \n  \nFigure 6.

The Write Disable instruction is entered by driving  /CS low, shifting the instruction code “04h” into the DI \npin and then driving /CS high. Note that the WEL bit is automatically reset after Power -up and upon \ncompletion of the Write Status Register, Erase/Program Security Registers, Page Program, Quad Page \nProgr am, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase and Reset instructions.  \n  \nFigure 7. Write Disable Instruction  \n Read Status Register -1 (05h), Status Register -2 (35h) & Status Register -3 (15h)  \nThe Read Status Register instructions allow the 8 -bit Status Registers to be read. The instruction is entered \nby driving /CS low and shifting the instruction code “05h” for Status Register -1, “35h” for Status Register -2 \nor “15h” for Status Register -3 into the DI pin on the rising edge of CLK. The status register bits are then \nshifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure \n8. Refer to section 7.1 for Status Register descriptions.  \nThe Read Status  Register instruction may be used at any time, even while a Program, Erase or Write Status \nRegister cycle is in progress. This allows the BUSY status bit to be checked to determine when the cycle \nis complete and if the device can accept another instruction . The Status Register can be read continuously, \nas shown in Figure 8. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \n \nFigure 8.

The writable Status Register \nbits include:  SEC, TB, BP[2:0] in Status Register -1; CMP, LB[3:1], QE, SRL in Status Register -2; DRV1, \nDRV0, WPS in Status Register -3. All other Stat us Register bit locations are read -only and will not be \naffected by the Write Status Register instruction. LB[3:1] are non -volatile OTP bits, once it is set to 1, it \ncannot be cleared to 0.  \nTo write non -volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enab le (06h) instruction must previously have \nbeen executed for the device to accept the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL must \nequal 1). Once write enabled, the instruction is entered by driving /CS low, sending the instruction code \n“01h/31h/11h”, and then writing the status register data byte as illustrated in Figure 9a.  \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction must have \nbeen executed prior to the Write Status Register instr uction (Status Register bit WEL remains 0). However, \nSRL and LB[3:1] cannot be changed from “1” to “0” because of the OTP protection for these bits. Upon \npower off or the execution of a Software/Hardware Reset, the volatile Status Register bit values will be lost, \nand the non -volatile Status Register bit values will be restored.  \nDuring non -volatile Status Register write operation (06h combined with 01h/31h/11h), after /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Write Status Register cycle will commence for a time du ration of t W (See AC \nCharacteristics). While the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction \nmay still be accessed to check the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Write Status \nRegister cycle and a 0 when the cycle is finished and ready to accept other instructions again. After the \nWrite Status Register cycle has finished, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register will be \ncleared to 0.  \nDuring volatile Status Register write operation (50h combined with 01h/31h/11h), after /CS is driven high, \nthe Status Register bits will be refreshed to the new values within the time period of t SHSL2  (See AC \nCharacteristics). BUSY bit will remain 0 during the Status Register bit refresh period.  \nRefer to sec tion 7.1 for Status Register descriptions.  \n \nFigure 9a.

If /CS is driven high after the eighth clock, the Write \nStatus Register -1 (01h) instruction will only program the Status Register -1, the Status Register -2 will not \nbe affected (Previous generations will clear CMP and QE bits).  \n \nFigure 9c.

The \ninstruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and then shifting the instruction code “03h” followed by a \n24-bit address (A23 -A0) into the DI pin. The co de and address bits are latched on the rising edge of the \nCLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location will be shifted out \non the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The address  is automatically \nincremented to the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted out allowing for a continuous \nstream of data. This means that the entire memory can be accessed with a single instruction as long as the \nclock continues. The instru ction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nThe Read Data instruction sequence is shown in Figure 14. If a Read Data instruction is issued while an \nErase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any \neffects on  the current cycle. The Read Data instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of f R \n(see AC Electrical Characteristics).  \n \n \nFigure 14.

The Quad I/O dramatically reduces instruction overhead \nallowing faster random access for code execution (XIP) directly from the Quad SPI. The  Quad Enable bit \n(QE) of Status Register -2 must be set to enable the Fast Read Quad I/O  Instruction .  \n \nFigure 24 a. Fast Read Quad I/O Instruction (M7-M0 should be set to F xh) \n \nFast Read Quad I/O with “8/16/32/64 -Byte Wrap Around”  \n \nThe Fast  Read Quad I/O instruction can also be used to access a specific portion within a page by issuing \na “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) command prior to EBh. The “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) command can either \nenable or disable the “Wrap Around” feature for the fol lowing EBh commands. When “Wrap Around” is \nenabled, the data being accessed can be limited to either an 8, 16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a 256 -byte \npage. The output data starts at the initial address specified in the instruction, once it reaches the ending \nboundary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, the output will wrap around to the beginning boundary \nautomatically until /CS is pulled high to terminate the command.  \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical addr ess and then \nfill the cache afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing multiple read \ncommands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction allows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be set. The W4 bit is used to enable \nor disable the “Wra p Around” operation while W6 -5 are used to specify the length of the wrap around section \nwithin a page.

Certain applications can benefit \nfrom this feature and improve the overall system code execution performance.  \nSimilar to a Quad I/O instruction, the S et Burst with Wrap instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low \nand then shifting the instruction code “77h” followed by 24 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap Bits”, W7 -0.

To exit the “Wrap Around” \nfunction and return to normal read operation, another Set Burst with Wrap instruction should be issued to  \nset W4 = 1.

A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device \nwill accept the Page Program Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The instruction is initiated by driving \nthe /CS pin low then shifting the i nstruction code “02h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least \none data byte, into the DI pin. The  /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while \ndata is being sent to the device. The Page Program instruction sequence is shown in Figure 29.  \nIf an entire 256 byte page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significant address bits) \nshould be set to 0. If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks exceeds the remaining \npage length, the addre ssing will wrap to the beginning of the page. In some cases, less than 256 bytes (a \npartial page) can be programmed without having any effect on other bytes within the same page. One \ncondition to perform a partial page program is that the number of clocks cannot exceed the remaining page \nlength. If more than 256 bytes are sent to the device the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page \nand overwrite previously sent data.  \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the /CS pin must be driven high after  the eighth bit of the last byte \nhas been latched. If this is not done the Page Program instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Page Program instruction will commence for a time duration of tpp (See AC \nCharacteristics). W hile the Page Program cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction may \nstill be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Page Program \ncycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is r eady to accept other instructions again. \nAfter the Page Program cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared \nto 0. The Page Program instruction will not be executed if the addressed page is protected by the Block \nProtect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits or the Individual Block/Sector Locks.  \n \nFigure 29.

The Quad Page Program can improve \nperformance for PROM Programmer and applications that have slow clock speeds <5MHz. Systems with \nfaster clock speed will not realize much benefit for the Quad Page Program instruction since the inherent \npage program time is much greater than the time it take to clock -in the data.  \nTo use Quad Page Program the Quad Enable (QE) bit in Status Register -2 must be set to 1. A Write Enable \ninstruction  must be e xecuted before the device will accept the Quad Page Program instruction (Status \nRegister -1, WEL=1). The instruction is initiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting the instruction code \n“32h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least one data  byte, into the IO pins.

The Erase/Program Suspend instruction sequence is shown in Figure 35.  \nThe Write Status Register instruction (01h) and Erase instructions (20h, 5 2h, D8h, C7h, 60h, 44h) are not \nallowed during Erase Suspend. Erase Suspend is valid only during the Sector or Block erase operation. If \nwritten during the Chip Erase operation, the Erase Suspend instruction is ignored. The Write Status \nRegister instructio n (01h) and Program instructions (02h, 32h, 42h) are not allowed during Program \nSuspend. Program Suspend is valid only during the Page Program or Quad Page Program operation.  \nThe Erase/Program Suspend instruction “75h” will be accepted by the device only i f the SUS bit in the \nStatus Register equals to 0 and the BUSY bit equals to 1 while a Sector or Block Erase or a Page Program \noperation is on -going. If the SUS bit equals to 1 or the BUSY bit equals to 0, the Suspend instruction will \nbe ignored by the devi ce. A maximum of time of “t SUS” (See AC Characteristics) is required to suspend the \nerase or program operation. The BUSY bit in the Status Register will be cleared from 1 to 0 within “t SUS” \nand the SUS bit in the Status Register will be set from 0 to 1 imm ediately after Erase/Program Suspend. \nFor a previously resumed Erase/Program operation, it is also required that the Suspend instruction “75h” is \nnot issued earlier than a minimum of time of “t SUS” following the preceding Resume instruction “7Ah”.  \nUnexpect ed power off during the Erase/Program suspend state will reset the device and release the \nsuspend state. SUS bit in the Status Register will also reset to 0. The data within the page, sector or block \nthat was being suspended may become corrupted.

The lower power consumption makes the Power -down instructio n \nespecially useful for battery powered applications (See ICC1 and ICC2 in AC Characteristics). The \ninstruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “B9h” as shown in Figure \n37.  \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after th e eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the Power -down \ninstruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the power -down state will entered within the time \nduration of t DP (See AC Characteristics). While in the power -down state only the  Release Power -down / \nDevice ID (ABh) instruction, which restores the device to normal operation, will be recognized. All other \ninstructions are ignored. This includes the Read Status Register instruction, which is always available \nduring normal operation.  Ignoring all but one instruction makes the Power Down state a useful condition for \nsecuring maximum write protection.

It can be used to \nrelease the device from the power -down state , or obtain the devices electronic identification (ID) number.  \nTo release the device from the power -down state, the instruction is issued by driving the /CS pin low, shifting \nthe instruction code “ABh” and driving /CS high as shown in Figure 38a. Release from power -down will take \nthe time duration of t RES1 (See AC Ch aracteristics) before the device will resume normal operation and \nother instructions are accepted. The /CS pin must remain high during the t RES1 time duration.  \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the power -down state, the instruction is ini tiated by \ndriving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3 -dummy bytes. The Device ID \nbits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The Device ID value \nfor the W25 Q16JV  is listed in  Manufacturer and Device Identification table. The Device ID can be read \ncontinuously. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obtain the Device ID, the instruction is the \nsame as pre viously described, and shown in Figure 38b, except that after /CS is driven high it must remain \nhigh for a time duration of t RES2 (See AC Characteristics). After this time duration the device will resume \nnormal operation and other instructions will be acce pted.

The SFDP parameter s \nare stored in one or more Parameter Identification (PID) tables. Currently only one PID table is specified, \nbut more may be added in the future. The Read SFDP Register instruction is compatible with the SFDP \nstandard initially established in 2010 for PC and other applications, as well as the JEDEC standard \nJESD216 -serials  that is published in 2011. Most Winbond SpiFlash Memories shipped after June 2011 \n(date code 1124 and beyond) support the SFDP feature as specified in the applicable datasheet.  \nThe Read  SFDP instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “5Ah” \nfollowed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0)(1) into the DI pin. Eight “dummy” clocks are also required before the \nSFDP register contents are shifted out on the falling edge of the 40th CLK with most significant bit (MSB) \nfirst as shown in Figure 44. For SFDP register values and descriptions, please re fer to the Winbond \nApplication Note for SFDP Definition Table.  \nNote 1: A23 -A8 = 0; A7 -A0 are used to define the starting byte address for the 256 -Byte SFDP Register.  \n \nFigure 44.

These registers may be used by the system manufacturers to store security and other important \ninformation separately from the main memory array.  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction is similar to the Sector Erase instruction. A Write Enable instruction \nmust be executed before the device will accept the Erase Security Register Instruction (Status Register bit \nWEL must equal 1). The instruction is i nitiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code \n“44h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) to erase one of the three security registers.  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity  Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 45. The /CS pin must be driven high \nafter the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the instruction will not be executed. \nAfter /CS is driven high, the self -timed Erase Security Register operation will commence for a time duration \nof tSE (See AC Characteristics). While the Erase Security Register cycle is in p rogress, the Read Status \nRegister instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 \nduring the erase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept other \ninstructions again. A fter the Erase Security Register cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in \nthe Status Register is cleared to 0. The Security Register Lock Bits (LB3 -1) in the Status Register -2 can be \nused to OTP protect the security registers. Once a lock bit  is set to 1, the corresponding security register \nwill be permanently locked, Erase Security Register instruction to that register will be ignored (Refer to \nsection 7.1.8 for detail descriptions). \n \nFigure 45.

It allows from one \nbyte to 256 bytes of security register data to be programmed at previously erased  (FFh) memory locations. \nA Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Program Security Register \nInstruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting \nthe instruction code “42h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. \nThe /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the device.  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nThe Program Security Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 46. The Security Register Lock Bits \n(LB3 -1) in the Status Register -2 can be used to OTP protect the security registers. Once a lock bit is set to \n1, the corresponding security register will be permanently locked, Program Security Register instruction to \nthat register will be ignored (See 7.1.8, 8.2.25 for detail descriptions). \n \nFigure 46.

The instruction is initiated by driving \nthe /CS pin low and then shifting the instruction code “48h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and eight \n“dummy” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the risin g edge of the CLK pin. \nAfter the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location will be shifted out on the DO \npin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The byte address is automatically \nincremented to the ne xt byte address after each byte of data is shifted out. Once the byte address reaches \nthe last byte of the register (byte address FFh), it will reset to address 00h, the first byte of the register, and \ncontinue to increment. The instruction is completed by  driving /CS high. The Read Security Register \ninstruction sequence is shown in Figure 47. If a Read Security Register instruction is issued while an Erase, \nProgram or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effec ts on \nthe current cycle. The Read Security Register instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of F R \n(see AC Electrical Characteristics).  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register  #2 00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \n \n \nFigure 47.

Once the Reset instruction is accepted, any on -going \ninternal operations will be terminated and the device will return to its default power -on state and lose all the \ncurrent volatile s ettings, such as Volatile Status Register bits, Write Enable Latch (WEL) status, \nProgram/Erase Suspend status, Read parameter setting (P7 -P0), and Wrap Bit setting (W6 -W4).  \n“Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” instructions can be issued in SPI mode. To a void accidental reset, \nboth instructions must be issued in sequence. Any other commands other than “Reset (99h)” after the \n“Enable Reset (66h)” command will disable the “Reset Enable” state. A new sequence of “Enable Reset \n(66h)” and “Reset (99h)” is neede d to reset the device. Once the Reset command is accepted by the device, \nthe device will take approximately tRST=30us to reset. During this period, no command will be accepted.  \nData corruption may happen if there is an on -going or suspended internal Erase or Program operation when \nReset command sequence is accepted by the device. It is recommended to check the BUSY bit and the \nSUS bit in Status Register before issuing the Reset command sequence.  \n \nFigure 58.
