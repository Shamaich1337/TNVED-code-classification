The deviceoperates with input voltages from 4V to 60V. The devicecan program the output voltage between 0.8V to VIN. Thelow quiescent current design with the integrated low R\nDS(ON)\nof high-side MOSFET achieves high efficiency over thewide load range. The peak current mode control with simpleexternal compensation allows the use of small inductorsand results in fast transient response and good loopstability.\nThe wide switching frequency of 100kHz to 2500kHz allows\nfor efficiency and size optimization when selecting theoutput filter components. The ultra-low minimum on-timeenables constant-frequency operation even at very highstep-down ratios. For switching noise sensitiveapplications, it can be externally synchronized from300kHz to 2200kHz.\nThe RTQ6362 provides complete protection functions such\nas input under-voltage lockout, output under-voltageprotection, output over-voltage protection, over-currentprotection, and thermal shutdown. Cycle-by-cycle currentlimit provides protection against shorted outputs, and soft-start eliminates input current surge during start-up.

Aninternal oscillator initiates the turn-on of the high-sideMOSFET. At the beginning of each clock cycle, the internalhigh-side MOSFET turns on, allowing current to ramp-upin the inductor. The inductor current is internally monitoredduring each switching cycle. The output voltage is sensedon the FB pin via the resistor divider, R1 and R2, andcompared with the internal reference voltage (V\nREF) to\ngenerate a compensation signal (V COMP) on the COMP\npin. A control signal derived from the inductor current iscompared to the voltage at the COMP pin, derived fromthe feedback voltage. When the inductor current reachesits threshold, the high-side MOSFET is turned off andinductor current ramps down. While the high-side MOSFETis off, the inductor current is supplied through the externallow-side diode, freewheel diode, connected between theSW pin and GND. This cycle repeats at the next clockcycle. In this way, duty-cycle and output voltage arecontrolled by regulating inductor current.\nLight Load Operation\nThe RTQ6362 operates in power saving mode (PSM) at\nlight load to improve light load efficiency. IC starts to switchwhen V\nFB is lower than PSM threshold ( V REF x 1.005,\ntypically) and stops switching when V FB is high enough.\nDuring PSM, IC controls the minimum inductor peak\ncurrent (I L_PEAK ) by clamping the COMP level. During non-\nswitching period, most of the internal circuit is shut down,and the supply current drops to quiescent current (90 μA,\ntypically) to reduce the quiescent power consumption.With lower output loading, the non-switching period islonger, so the effective switching frequency becomes lowerto reduce the switching loss and switch driving loss.\nSwitching Frequency Selection and Synchronization\nThe RTQ6362 provides an RT/SYNC pin for switching\nfrequency selection. The switching frequency can be setby using external resistor R\nRT/SYNC  and the switching\nfrequency range is from 100kHz to 2.5MHz. The RTQ6362can also be synchronized with an external clock rangingfrom 300kHz to 2.2MHz by RT/SYNC pin. The switching\nfrequency of synchronization should be equal to or higherthan the frequency set by the RT resistor. For example, ifthe switching frequency of synchronization is 500kHz orhigher, the R\nRT/SYNC  should be selected for 500kHz.\nThe RTQ6362 implements a frequency foldback function\nto protect the device at over-load or short-circuitedcondition, especially higher switching frequencies and inputvoltages. The switching frequency is divided by 1, 2, 4,and 8 as the FB pin voltage falls from 0.8 V to 0 V forswitching frequency control by RT resistor setting modeand the synchronization mode both. The frequency foldbackfunction increases the switching cycle period  and providesmore time for the inductor current to ramp down.\nMaximum Duty Cycle Operation\nThe RTQ6362 is designed to operate in dropout at the\nhigh duty cycle approaching 100%. If the operational dutycycle is large and the required off-time becomes smallerthan minimum off-time, the RTQ6362 starts to enable skipoff-time function and keeps high-side MOSFET oncontinuously.\nThe RTQ6362 implements skip off-time function to achieve\nhigh duty approaching 100% and the maximum outputvoltage is near the minimum input supply voltage of theapplication for input voltage momentarily falls down to thenormal output voltage requirement. The input voltage atwhich the devices enter dropout changes depending onthe input voltage, output voltage, switching frequency, loadcurrent, and the efficiency of the design.\nFor normal operation, the minimum input voltage can be\ncalculated from below equation :\nOUT OUT_MAX L D\nIN_MIN\nSW OFF_MIN\nOUT_MAX DS(ON)_H DV+  I R +  V\nV =  1f t\n+ I R  + V\uf0b4\n\uf02d\uf0b4\n\uf0b4\nwhere V IN_MIN  is the minimum normal operating input\nvoltage; R DS(ON)_H  is the on-resistance of the high-side\nMOSFET; V D is the forward conduction voltage of the\nfreewheel diode; R L is the DC resistance of inductor.\n7DSQ6362-01   April  2020 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2020 Richtek Technology Corporation.

The BOOT UVLO usuallyactives at extremely high conversion ratio or the higherV\nOUT application operates at very light load. With such\nconditions when the BOOT to SW voltage falls belowV\nBOOT_UVLO_L  (2.7V, typically), the device turns on the\ninternal BOOT recharge FET (150ns, typically) to chargethe BOOT capacitor. The BOOT UVLO is sustained untilthe BOOT to SW voltage is higher than V\nBOOT_UVLO_H\n(2.8V, typically).\nEnable Control\nThe RTQ6362 provides an EN pin, as an external chip\nenable control, to enable or disable the device. If V EN is\nheld below the enable threshold voltage, switching isinhibited even if the VIN voltage is above VIN under-voltagelockout threshold (V\nUVLOH ). If V EN is held below 0.4V, the\nconverter will enter into shutdown mode, that is, theconverter is disabled. During shutdown mode, the supplycurrent can be reduced to I\nSHDN (1.3 μA, typically). If the\nEN voltage rises above the enable threshold voltage whilethe VIN voltage is higher than V\nUVLOH , the device will be\nturned on, that is, switching being enabled and soft-startsequence being initiated. The EN pin has an internal pull-up current source I\nEN (0.9 μA, typically) that enables\noperation of the RTQ6362 when the EN pin floats. The ENpin can be used to adjust the under-voltage lockout (UVLO)threshold and hysteresis by using two external resistors.The RTQ6362 implements additional hysteresis currentsource I\nEN_Hys  (2.9 μA, typically) to adjust the UVLO. The\nIEN_Hys  is sourced out of the EN pin when V EN is larger\nthan enable threshold voltage. When the V EN falls below\nenable threshold voltage, the I EN_Hys  will be stopped\nsourcing out of the EN pin.\nSoft-Start and Tracking Control\nThe soft-start function is used to prevent large inrush\ncurrents while the converter is being powered up. TheRTQ6362GSP provides internal soft-start and theRTQ6362GQW provides external soft-start function forinrush currents control. The RTQ6362GQW provides anSS/TR pin so that the soft-start time can be programmedby selecting the value of the external soft-start capacitor\nC\nSS/TR  connected from the SS/TR pin to ground or\ncontrolled by external ramp voltage to SS/TR pin. Duringthe start-up sequence, the soft-start capacitor is chargedby an internal current source I\nSS (2μA, typically) to\ngenerate a soft-start ramp voltage as a reference voltageto the PWM comparator. The high-side MOSFET will startswitching if the voltage difference between SS/TR pin andFB pin is equal to 75mV ( i.e. V\nSS/TR − VFB = 75mV,\ntypically) during power-up period. If the output is  pre-biased to a certain voltage during start-up for some reason,the device will not start switching until the voltage differencebetween SS/TR pin and FB pin is equal to 75mV(typically). Only when this ramp voltage is higher than thefeedback voltage V\nFB, the switching will be resumed. The\nFB voltage will track the SS/TR pin ramp voltage with aSS/TR to FB offset voltage (75mV, typically) during soft-start interval. The output voltage can then ramp up smoothlyto its targeted regulation voltage, and the converter canhave a monotonic smooth start-up. For soft-start control,the SS pin should never be left unconnected. After the FBpin voltage rises above 94% of V\nREF (typically), the\nPGOOD pin will be in high impedance and the V PGOOD  will\nbe held high. The typical start-up waveform shown inFigure 1 indicates the sequence and timing between theoutput voltage and related voltage.\n8DSQ6362-01   April  2020 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2020 Richtek Technology Corporation.

The Logic of PGOOD for RTQ6362GQWInput Under-Voltage Lockout\nIn addition to the EN pin, the RTQ6362 also provides enable\ncontrol through the VIN pin. If V EN rises above V TH_EN  first,\nthe switching will be inhibited until the VIN voltage risesabove V\nUVLOH . It is to ensure that the internal regulator is\nready so that operation with not-fully-enhanced internalhigh-side MOSFET can be prevented. After the device ispowered up, if the input voltage V\nIN goes below the UVLO\nfalling threshold voltage (V UVLOL ), this switching will be\ninhibited; if V IN rises above the UVLO rising threshold\n(VUVLOH ), the device will resume switching. Note that V IN\n= 4V is only design for input voltage momentarily fallsdown to the UVLO threshold voltage requirement, andnormal input voltage should be larger than the V\nUVLOH .\nHigh-Side MOSFET Peak Current Limit Protection\nThe RTQ6362 includes a cycle-by-cycle high-side\nMOSFET peak current-limit protection against thecondition that the inductor current increasing abnormally,even over the inductor saturation current rating. Theinductor current through the high-side MOSFET will bemeasured after a certain amount of delay when the high-side MOSFET being turned on. If an over-current conditionoccurs, the converter will immediately turn off the high-side MOSFET to prevent the inductor current exceedingthe high-side MOSFET peak current limit (I\nLIM).\nOutput Under-Voltage Protection\nThe RTQ6362 includes output under-voltage protection\n(UVP) against over-load or short-circuited condition byconstantly monitoring the feedback voltage V\nFB. If V FB\ndrops below the under-voltage protection trip threshold(50% of the internal reference voltage, typically), the UVcomparator will go high to turn off the internal high-sideswitch. If the output under-voltage condition continues fora period of time, the RTQ6362 enters output under-voltageprotection with hiccup mode and discharges the C\nSS/TR\nby an internal discharging current source I SS_DIS  (0.5 μA,\ntypically). During hiccup mode, the device remainsshutdown. After the SS pin voltage is discharged to lessthan 54mV (typically), the RTQ6362 attempts to re-startup again, and the internal charging current source I\nSS (2μA,\ntypically) gradually increases the voltage on C SS/TR. The\nhigh-side MOSFET will start switching when voltagePower Good Indication\nThe RTQ6362GQW features an open-drain power-good\noutput (PGOOD) to monitor the output voltage status. Theoutput delay of comparator prevents false flag operationfor short excursions in the output voltage, such as duringline and load transients. Pull-up PGOOD with a resistorto an external voltage source and it is recommended touse pull-up resistance between the values of 1 and 10k Ω\nto reduce the switching noise coupling to PGOOD pin.The PGOOD assertion requires input voltage above 1.5V.The power-good function is controlled by a comparatorconnected to the feedback signal V\nFB. If V FB rises above\nthe power-good high threshold (V TH_PGLH1 ) (94% of the\nreference voltage, typically), the PGOOD pin will be inhigh impedance and V\nPGOOD  will be held high after a certain\ndelay elapsed. When V FB falls below power-good low\nthreshold (V TH_PGHL2 ) (92% of the reference voltage,\ntypically) or exceeds V TH_PGHL1  (109% of the reference\nvoltage, typically), the PGOOD pin will be pulled low. ForV\nFB higher than V TH_PGHL1 , VPGOOD  can be pulled high\nagain if V FB drops back by a power-good high threshold\n(VTH_PGLH2 ) (106% of the reference voltage, typically).\nOnce being started-up, if any internal protection istriggered, PGOOD will be pulled low to GND.  The internal\nopen-drain pull-down device (6 Ω, typically) will pull the\nPGOOD pin low. The power good indication profile is shownin Figure 2.\n9DSQ6362-01   April  2020 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2020 Richtek Technology Corporation.

Since the V FB is lower\nthan the reference voltage (V REF) at over-load or short-\ncircuited condition, the COMP voltage will be high todemand maximum output current. Once the over-load orshort-circuited condition is removed, the COMP voltageresumes to the normal voltage to regulate the outputvoltage. The output voltage leads to the possibility of anoutput overshoot if the load transient is faster than theCOMP voltage transient response, especially for smalloutput capacitance. If the V\nFB goes above the 109% of\nthe reference voltage, the high-side MOSFET will be forcedoff to limit the output voltage. When the V\nFB drops lower\nthan the 106% of the reference voltage, the high-sideMOSFET will be resumed.\nOver-Temperature Protection\nThe RTQ6362 includes an over-temperature protection\n(OTP) circuitry to prevent overheating due to excessivepower dissipation. The OTP will shut down switchingoperation when junction temperature exceeds a thermalshutdown threshold T\nSD. Once the junction temperature\ncools down by a thermal shutdown hysteresis ( ΔTSD), the\nIC will resume normal operation with a complete soft-start.SS\nSS_DIS1 SS\nSS_DISV0 . 0 5 4t=  CI \uf02d\uf0b4difference between SS pin and FB pin is equal to 75mV (\ni.e. V SS − VFB = 75mV, typically). If the output under-\nvoltage condition is not removed, the high-side MOSFETstops switching when the voltage difference between SSpin and FB pin is 1.2V ( i.e. V\nSS − VFB = 1.2V, typically)\nand then the I SS_DIS  discharging current source begins to\ndischarge C SS/TR . Upon completion of the soft-start\nsequence, if the output under-voltage condition is removed,the converter will resume normal operation; otherwise, suchcycle for auto-recovery will be repeated until the outputunder-voltage condition is cleared.

External component selectionis largely driven by the load requirement and begins withthe switching frequency selection by using external resistorR\nRT/SYNC . Next, the inductor L, the input capacitor C IN,\nthe output capacitor C OUT and freewheel diode are chosen.\nNext, feedback resistors and compensation circuit areselected to set the desired output voltage and crossoverfrequency, and the bootstrap capacitor C\nBOOT can be\nselected. Finally, the remaining optional externalcomponents can be selected for functions such as theEN, external soft-start, PGOOD, and synchronization.\nSwitching Frequency Setting\nThe RTQ6362 offers adjustable switching frequency setting\nand the switching frequency can be set by using externalresistor R\nRT/SYNC . The switching frequency range is from\n100kHz to 2.5MHz. The selection of the operatingfrequency is a trade-off between efficiency and componentsize. High frequency operation allows the use of smallerinductor and capacitor values. Operation at lowerfrequencies improves efficiency by reducing internal gatecharge and transition losses, but requires larger inductancevalues and/or capacitance to maintain low output ripplevoltage. The additional constraints on operating frequencyare the minimum on-time and minimum off-time. Theminimum on-time, t\nON_MIN , is the smallest duration of time\nin which the high-side switch can be in its “on” state.\nThe minimum on-time of the RTQ6362 is 100ns (typically).In continuous mode operation, the maximum operatingfrequency, f\nSW_MAX , can be derived from the minimum on-\ntime according to the formula below :\nOUT\nSW_MAX\nON_MIN IN_MAXVf =  tV\uf0b4\nwhere V IN_MAX  is the maximum operating input voltage.\nThe minimum off-time, t OFF_MIN , is the smallest amount of\ntime that the RTQ6362 is capable of tripping the currentcomparator and turning the high-side MOSFET back off.The minimum off-time of the RTQ6362 is 130ns (typically).If the switching frequency should be constant, the requiredoff-time needs to be larger than minimum off-time.

The failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)consideration is applied to the RT/SYNC pin setting toavoid abnormal switching frequency operation at failureconditions. It includes failure scenarios of short-circuit toground and the pin is left open. The switching frequencywill be 900kHz (typically) when the RT/SYNC pin isshorted to ground, and 240kHz (typically) when the pin isleft open.

Generally,three key inductor parameters are specified for operationwith the device: inductance value (L), inductor saturationcurrent (I\nSAT), and DC resistance (DCR).\nA good compromise between size and loss is a 30% peak-\nto-peak ripple current to the IC rated current. The switchingfrequency, input voltage, output voltage, and selectedinductor ripple current determines the inductor value asfollows :\nOUT IN OUT\nIN SW LV( V V )L = Vf I\uf0b4\uf02d\n\uf0b4\uf0b4 \uf044\nLarger inductance values result in lower output ripple\nvoltage and higher efficiency, but a slightly degradedtransient response. This results in additional phase lag inthe loop and reduces the crossover frequency. As the ratioof the slope-compensation ramp to the sensed-currentramp increases, the current-mode system tilts towardsvoltage-mode control. Lower inductance values allow forsmaller case size, but the increased ripple lowers theeffective current limit threshold and increases the AClosses in the inductor. It also causes insufficient slopecompensation and ultimately loop instability as duty cycleapproaches or exceeds 50%. When duty cycle exceeds50%, below condition needs to be satisfied :\nOUT IN OUTL\nIN SWV( V V )I=Vf L\uf0b4\uf02d\uf044\uf0b4\uf0b4\nL_PEAK OUT_MAX L1I  = I  + I2\uf044The current flowing through the inductor is the inductor\nripple current plus the output current. During power up,faults, or transient load conditions, the inductor currentcan increase above the calculated peak inductor currentlevel calculated above . In transient conditions, the inductorcurrent can increase up to the switch current limit of thedevice. For this reason, the most conservative approachis to specify an inductor with a saturation current ratingwhich is equal to or greater than the switch current limitrather than the peak inductor current. It is recommendedto use shielded inductors for good EMI performance.\nInput Capacitor Selection\nInput capacitance, C\nIN, is needed to filter the pulsating\ncurrent at the drain of the high-side MOSFET. The C IN\nshould be sized to do this without causing a large variationin input voltage. The peak-to-peak voltage ripple on inputcapacitor can be estimated as equation below :\nwhere\nOUT\nINVD = V\uf068\uf0b4CIN OUT OUT\nIN SW1DV  = D I  + ESR ICf\uf02d\uf044\uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0b4\uf0b4\nFigure 5 shows the C IN ripple current flowing through the\ninput capacitors and the resulting voltage ripple acrossthe capacitors.\nFor ceramic capacitors, the equivalent series resistance\n(ESR) is very low, the ripple which is caused by ESR canbe ignored, and the minimum value of effective inputcapacitance can be estimated as equation below :\n\uf028\uf029\nIN_MIN OUT_MAX\nCIN_MAX SWD1 DC IVf =\uf02d\uf0b4\uf044\uf0b4\nCIN Ripple Current CIN Ripple Voltage VCIN\uf044\n(1-D) x I OUT\nD x I OUT\n(1-D) x t SWD x t SWVESR= IOUTx ESR\nFigure 5. C IN Ripple Voltage and Ripple CurrentA good compromise among size, efficiency, and transient\nresponse can be achieved by setting an inductor currentripple ( ΔI\nL) with about 10% to 50% of the maximum rated\noutput current (2.5A).\nTo enhance the efficiency, choose a low-loss inductor\nhaving the lowest possible DC resistance that fits in theallotted dimensions. The inductor value determines notonly the ripple current but also the load-current value atwhich DCM/CCM switchover occurs. The selected inductorshould have a saturation current rating greater than thepeak current limit of the device. The core must be largeenough not to saturate at the peak inductor current (I\nL_PEAK ) :OUTSWV2.1 fL\uf0b4\uf03e\nwhere ΔVCIN_MAX  is maximum input ripple voltage.\n23DSQ6362-01   April  2020 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2020 Richtek Technology Corporation. All rights reserved.                          is a registered trademark of Ric htek Technology Corporation.\nRTQ6362\nIn addition, the input capacitor needs to have a very low\nESR and must be rated to handle the worst-case RMSinput current. The RMS ripple current (I\nRMS) of the regulator\ncan be determined by the input voltage (V IN), output voltage\n(VOUT), and rated output current (I OUT) as the following\nequation :\nOUT INRMS OUT_MAX\nIN OUTV VI I 1VV\uf040\uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02d\nFrom the above, the maximum RMS input ripple current\noccurs at maximum output load, which will be used asthe requirements to consider the current capabilities ofthe input capacitors. The maximum ripple voltage usuallyoccurs at 50% duty cycle, that is, V\nIN = 2 x V OUT. It is\ncommon to use the worse I RMS ≅ 0.5 x I OUT_MAX  at V IN = 2\nx V OUT for design. Note that ripple current ratings from\ncapacitor manufacturers are often based on only 2000hours of life which makes it advisable to further de-ratethe capacitor, or choose a capacitor rated at a highertemperature than required.\nSeveral capacitors may also be paralleled to meet size,\nheight and thermal requirements in the design. For lowinput voltage applications, sufficient bulk input capacitanceis needed to minimize transient effects during output loadchanges.\nCeramic capacitors are ideal for switching regulator\napplications because of its small size, robustness, andvery low ESR. However, care must be taken when thesecapacitors are used at the input. A ceramic input capacitorcombined with trace or cable inductance forms a highquality (under damped) tank circuit. If the RTQ6362 circuitis plugged into a live supply, the input voltage can ring totwice its nominal value, possibly exceeding the device'srating. This situation is easily avoided by placing the lowESR ceramic input capacitor in parallel with a bulkcapacitor with higher ESR to damp the voltage ringing.\nThe input capacitor should be placed as close as possible\nto the VIN pin with a low inductance connection to theGND of the IC. The VIN pin must be bypassed to groundwith a minimum value of effective capacitance 1.5 μF. For\n500kHz switching frequency application,  two 2.2 μF, X7R\ncapacitors can be connected between the VIN pin and theGND pin. The larger input capacitance is required when alower switching frequency is used. For filtering highfrequency noise, an additional small 0.1 μF capacitor should\nbe placed close to the part and the capacitor should be0402 or 0603 in size. X7R capacitors are recommendedfor best performance across temperature and input voltagevariations.\nOutput Capacitor Selection\nThe selection of C\nOUT is determined by considering to\nsatisfy the voltage ripple and the transient loads. The peak-to-peak output ripple, ΔV\nOUT, is determined by :\nOUT L\nSW OUT1V =  I E S R  +   8f C\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf044\uf044 \uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0b4\uf0b4 \uf0e8\uf0f8\nWhere the ΔIL is the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current.\nThe highest output ripple is at maximum input voltagesince ΔI\nL increases with input voltage. Multiple capacitors\nplaced in parallel may be needed to meet the ESR andRMS current handling requirements.\nRegarding to the transient loads, the V\nSAG and V SOAR\nrequirement should be taken into consideration for\nchoosing the effective output capacitance value. Theamount of output sag/soar is a function of the crossoverfrequency factor at PWM, and can be calculated frombelow equation :\nOUT\nSAG SOAR\nOUT CIV  = V  = 2C f\uf070\uf044\n\uf0b4\uf0b4 \uf0b4\nCeramic capacitors have very low equivalent series\nresistance (ESR) and provide the best ripple performance.The X7R dielectric capacitor is recommended for the bestperformance across temperature and input voltagevariations. The variation of the capacitance value withtemperature, DC bias voltage and switching frequencyneeds to be taken into consideration. For example, thecapacitance value of a capacitor decreases as the DC biasacross the capacitor increases. Be careful to consider thevoltage coefficient of ceramic capacitors when choosingthe value and case size. Most ceramic capacitors lose50% or more of their rated values when used near theirrated voltage.\nTransient performance can be improved with a higher value\noutput capacitor. Increasing the output capacitance willalso decrease the output voltage ripple.\nFreewheel Diode Selection\nWhen the high-side MOSFET turns off, inductor current\n24DSQ6362-01   April  2020 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2020 Richtek Technology Corporation.

The\nresistance of R1 can then be obtained as below :\nOUT REF\nREF R2 (V V )R1 = V\uf0b4\uf02d\nFor better output voltage accuracy, the divider resistors\n(R1 and R2) with ±1% tolerance or better should be used.\nCompensation Network Design\nThe purpose of loop compensation is to ensure stable\noperation while maximizing the dynamic performance. Anundercompensated system may result in unstableoperation. Typical symptoms of an unstable power supplyinclude: audible noise from the magnetic components orceramic capacitors, jittering in the switching waveforms,oscillation of output voltage, overheating of power MOSFETand so on.\nIn most cases, the peak current mode control architecture\nused in the RTQ6362 only requires two externalcomponents to achieve a stable design as shown in Figure8. The compensation can be selected to accommodateany capacitor type or value. The external compensationalso allows the user to set the crossover frequency andoptimize the transient performance of the device. At aroundthe crossover frequency, the peak current mode control(PCMC) equivalent circuit of Buck converter can besimplified as shown in Figure 9. The method presentedhere is easy to calculate and ignore the effects of theinternal slope compensation.

Theconduction loss in the diode is determined by the forwardvoltage of the diode, and the switching loss in the diodecan be determined by the junction capacitor of the diode.The power dissipation of the diode can be calculated asfollowing formulaFigure 6.

It is always necessary to make ameasurement before releasing the design for finalproduction. Though the models of power supplies aretheoretically correct, they cannot take full account of thecircuit parasitic and component nonlinearity, such as theESR variations of output capacitors, the nonlinearity ofinductors and capacitors, etc. Also, circuit PCB noise andlimited measurement accuracy may also causemeasurement errors. A Bode plot is ideally measured witha network analyzer while Richtek application note \nAN038\nprovides an alternative way to check the stability quicklyand easily. Generally, follow the steps below to calculatethe compensation components :\n1. Set up the crossover frequency, f\nC. For stability\npurposes, the target is to have a loop gain slope thatis   −20dB/decade from a very low frequency to beyond\nthe crossover frequency. In general, one-twentieth toone-tenth of the switching frequency (5% to 10% offsw) is recommended to be the crossover frequency.Do “NOT ” design the crossover frequency over 80kHz\nwith the RTQ6362. For dynamic purposes, the higherthe bandwidth, the faster the load transient response.The downside of the high bandwidth is that it increasesthe susceptibility of the regulators to board noise whichultimately leads to excessive falling edge jitter of theswitch node voltage.\n2.

Efficiency Comparison between with and\nwithout Bootstrap DiodeExternal Bootstrap Resistor (Option)\nThe gate driver of an internal high-side MOSFET, utilized\nas a high-side switch, is optimized for turning on theswitch. The gate driver is not only fast enough for reducingswitching power loss, but also slow enough for minimizingEMI. The EMI issue is worse when the switch is turnedon rapidly due to induced high di/dt noises. When thehigh-side MOSFET is turned off, the SW node will bedischarged relatively slow by the inductor current becausethe presence of the dead time when both the high-sideMOSFET and low-side freewheel diode are turned off.\nIn some cases, it is desirable to reduce EMI further, even\nat the expense of some additional power dissipation. Theturn-on rate of the high-side MOSFET can be slowed byplacing a small bootstrap resistor R\nBOOT between the\nBOOT pin and the external bootstrap capacitor as shownin Figure 12. The recommended range for the R\nBOOT is\nseveral ohms to 10 ohms, and it could be 0402 or 0603 insize.\nThis will slow down the rates of the high-side switch turn-\non and the rise of V\nSW. In order to improve EMI performance\nand enhancement of the internal high-side MOSFET, therecommended application circuit is shown in Figure 13,which includes an external bootstrap diode for chargingthe bootstrap capacitor and a bootstrap resistor R\nBOOT\nplaced between the BOOT pin and the capacitor/diodeconnection.\nFigure 12.

If the EN voltagerises above the V\nTH_EN  (1.25V, typically) and the VIN voltage\nis higher than V UVLOH  (4.3V, typically), the device will be\nturned on, that is, switching is enabled and soft-startsequence is initiated. If the high UVLO is required, theEN pin can be used to adjust the under-voltage lockout(UVLO) threshold and hysteresis. There is an additionalhysteresis current source I\nEN_Hys  (2.9 μA, typically) which\nis sourced out of the EN pin when the EN pin voltageexceeds V\nTH_EN . When the EN pin drops below V TH_EN ,\nthe I EN_Hys  is removed. Therefore, the EN pin can be\nexternally connected to V IN by adding two resistors, R ENH\nand R ENL to achieve UVLO adjustment as shown in Figure\n14.\nAccording to the desired start and stop input voltage, the\nresistance of R EN1 and R EN2 can be obtained as below :\nStart Stop\nEN1EN_Hys\nTH_EN\nEN2\nStart TH_EN\nEN\nEN1VV\nR =  I\nV\nR =  VV\n + IR\uf02d\n\uf02d\nThe EN pin, with high-voltage rating, supports wide input\nvoltage range to adjust the VIN UVLO.\nFigure 14.

TheRTQ6362GQW provides an SS/TR pin so that the soft-start time can be programmed by selecting the value ofthe external soft-start capacitor C\nSS/TR connected from\nthe SS/TR pin to ground or controlled by external rampvoltage to SS/TR pin. An internal current source I\nSS (2μA,typically) charges an external capacitor to build a soft-\nstart ramp voltage. The internal charging current sourceI\nSS gradually increases the voltage on C SS/TR,  and the high-\nside MOSFET will start switching if voltage differencebetween SS/TR pin and FB pin is equal to 75mV ( i.e.V\nSS/TR − VFB = 75mV, typically) during power-up period.\nThe FB voltage will track the SS/TR pin ramp voltage witha SS/TR to FB offset voltage (75mV, typically) during soft-start interval. The typical soft-start time (t\nSS) which is the\nduration of V OUT rises from 10% to 90% of setting value is\ncalculated as follows :\nREF\nSS SS/TRSSV0 . 8t =  CI\uf0b4\uf0b4\nIf a heavy load is added to the output with large\ncapacitance, the output voltage will never enter regulationbecause of UVP.

The minimum synchronous pulse width ofthe external clock applied to the RT/SYNC pin must belarger than 40ns and the amplitude should have valleysthat are below 0.5V and peaks above 2.2V (up to 6V). Therising edge of the SW will be synchronized to the fallingedge of the RT/SYNC pin signal.\n28DSQ6362-01   April  2020 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2020 Richtek Technology Corporation.

Synchronization Mode in CCM\nThermal Considerations\nIn many applications, the RTQ6362 does not generate\nmuch heat due to its high efficiency and low thermalresistance of its WDFN-10SL 3x3 and SOP-8 (Exposedpad) packages. However, in applications which theRTQ6362 runs at a high ambient temperature and highinput voltage or high switching frequency, the generatedheat may exceed the maximum junction temperature ofthe part.\nThe junction temperature should never exceed the\nabsolute maximum junction temperature T\nJ(MAX) , listed\nunder Absolute Maximum Ratings, to avoid permanentdamage to the device. If the junction temperature reachesapproximately 175 °C, the RTQ6362 stops switching the\nhigh-side MOSFET until the temperature cools down by15°C.\nThe maximum power dissipation can be calculated by\nthe following formula :\nP\nD(MAX)  = (T J(MAX)  − TA) / θJA(EFFECTIVE)\nwhere T J(MAX)  is the maximum allowed junction temperature\nof the die. For recommended operating conditionspecifications, the maximum junction temperature is150°C. T\nA is the ambient operating temperature,\nθJA(EFFECTIVE)  is the system-level junction to ambient\nthermal resistance. It can be estimated from thermalmodeling or measurements in the system.\nThe thermal resistance of the device strongly depends on\nthe surrounding PCB layout and can be improved byproviding a heat sink of surrounding copper ground. Theaddition of backside copper with thermal vias, stiffeners,The switching frequency control of the RTQ6362 will switch\nfrom the RT resistor setting mode to the synchronizationmode when the external clock is applied to the RT/SYNCpin. The RTQ6362 transitions from the RT resistor settingmode to the synchronization mode within 60microseconds. Figure 15 and Figure 16 show the devicesynchronized to an external system clock in power savingmode (PSM) and continuous conduction mode (CCM).\nThe sub-harmonic oscillation may occur for duty cycle\ngreater than 50% in CCM at synchronization mode. Bychoosing a larger inductor, more slope compensation canbe achieved and the risk of such sub-harmonic oscillationsis eliminated.\nThe switching frequency of synchronization should be\nequal to or higher than the frequency set with the RTresistor. For example, if the switching frequency ofsynchronization will be 500kHz and higher, the R\nRT/SYNC\nshould be selected for 500kHz. Be careful to design thecompensation network and inductance for switchingfrequency controlled by both RT resistor setting modeand the synchronization mode.\nVRT/SYNC\n2V/DivVSW\n5V/Div\nISW\n2A/Div\nVRT/SYNC\n2V/DivVSW\n5V/Div\nISW\n200mA/Div\n29DSQ6362-01   April  2020 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2020 Richtek Technology Corporation.

Carefully select the freewheel diode to ensurethat thermal performance will not be limited by thefreewheel diode.\nIf the application calls for a higher ambient temperature\nand may exceed the recommended maximum junctiontemperature of 150 °C, care should be taken to reduce the\ntemperature rise of the part by using a heat sink or airflow.\nNote that the over-temperature protection is intended to\nprotect the device during momentary overload conditions.The protection is activated outside of the absolutemaximum range of operation as a secondary fail-safe andtherefore should not be relied upon operationally.Continuous operation above the specified absolutemaximum operating junction temperature may impairdevice reliability or permanently damage the device.\nLayout Guidelines\nWhen laying out the printed circuit board, the following\nchecklist should be used to ensure proper operation ofthe RTQ6362 :\n\uf07dFour-layer or six-layer PCB with maximum ground planeis strongly recommended for good thermal performance.\n\uf07dKeep the traces of the main current paths wide andshort.\n\uf07dPlace high frequency decoupling capacitor C IN3 as close\nto the IC as possible to reduce the loop impedance andminimize switch node ringing.\n\uf07dPlace bootstrap capacitor, C BOOT, as close to the IC as\npossible. Routing the trace with width of 20mil or wider.\n\uf07dPlace multiple vias under the device near VIN and GND,and close to input capacitors to reduce parasiticinductance and improve thermal performance. To keepthermal resistance low, extend the ground plane as muchas possible.  Add thermal vias under and near theRTQ6362 to additional ground planes within the circuitboard and on the bottom side.\n\uf07dThe high frequency switching nodes, SW and BOOT,should be as small as possible. Keep analogcomponents away from the SW and BOOT nodes.\uf07dPlace freewheel diode, D1, and inductor, L1, as close tothe IC as possible to reduce the area size of the SWexposed copper to reduce the electrically coupling fromthis voltage.\n\uf07dConnect the feedback sense network behind via of outputcapacitor.\n\uf07dPlace the feedback components R FB1 / RFB2 near the\nIC.\n\uf07dPlace the compensation components R CP1 / CCP1 / CCP2\nnear the IC.\n\uf07dThe RT/SYNC resistor, R RT/SYNC , should be placed as\nclose to the IC as possible because to the RT/SYNCpin is sensitive to noise.\nFigure 17 and Figure 18 are the RTQ6362GQW layout\nexamples.\n30DSQ6362-01   April  2020 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2020 Richtek Technology Corporation.
