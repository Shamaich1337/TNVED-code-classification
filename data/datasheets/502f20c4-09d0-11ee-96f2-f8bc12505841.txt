The AD8091/AD8092 have true single-supply capability, with an input voltage range extending 200 mV \nbelow the negative rail and within 1 V of the positive rail. \nDespite their low cost, the AD8091/AD8092 provide excellent \noverall performance and versatility. The output voltage swing \nextends to within 25 mV of each rail, providing the maximum \noutput dynamic range with excellent overdrive recovery. This makes the AD8091/AD8092 useful for video electronics, such as cameras, video switchers, or any high speed portable equip-ment. Low distortion and fast settling make them ideal for active filter applications. The AD8091/AD8092 offer a low power supply current and can \noperate on a single 3 V power supply. These features are ideally \nsuited for portable and battery-powered applications where size \nand power are critical. \nThe wide bandwidth and fast slew rate make these amplifiers \nuseful in many general-purpose, high speed applications where dual power supplies of up to ±6 V and single supplies from +3 \nV to +12 V are needed. \nThis low cost performance is offered in an 8-lead SOIC \n(AD8091/AD8092), a tiny SOT23-5 (AD8091), and an MSOP (AD8092). \n \n \nAD8091/AD8092 \n \nRev.

C | Page 7 of 20 MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION \nThe maximum safe power dissipation in the AD8091/AD8092 \npackage is limited by the associated rise in junction temperature (T\nJ) on the die. The plastic encapsulating the die locally reaches \nthe junction temperature. At approximately 150°C, which is the glass transition temperature, the plastic changes its properties. Even temporarily exceeding this temperature limit may change the stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric performance of the AD8091/AD8092. \nExceeding a junction temperature of 175°C for an extended \nperiod of time can result in changes in the silicon devices, \npotentially causing failure. \nThe still-air thermal properties of the package (θ JA), the ambient \ntemperature (T A), and the total power dissipated in the package \n(PD) can be used to determine the junction temperature of the die. \nThe junction temperature can be calculated as  \n()JADAJ θ P T T× + =  \nThe power dissipated in the package (P D) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the \npackage due to the load drive for all outputs. The quiescent power is the voltage between the supply pins (V\nS) times the \nquiescent current (I S). Assuming that the load (R L) is referenced \nto midsupply, then the total drive power is V S/2 × I OUT, some of \nwhich is dissipated in the package and some in the load  (V\nOUT × I OUT). The difference between the total drive power and \nthe load power is the drive power dissipated in the package. \n( )power load power drive total power quiescentPD − + =  \n()⎟⎟\n⎠⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝⎛\n⎟⎟\n⎠⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝⎛−⎟⎟\n⎠⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝⎛× + × =\nLOUT\nLOUT S\nS S DRV\nRV VI V P2\n2 \nRMS output voltages should be considered.

C | Page 12 of 20 LAYOUT, GROUNDING, AND BY PASSING CONSIDERATIONS \nPOWER SUPPLY BYPASSING \nPower supply pins are actually inputs, and care must be taken so \nthat a noise-free stable dc voltage is applied. The purpose of \nbypass capacitors is to create low impedances from the supply to ground at all frequencies, thereby shunting or filtering a majority of the noise. \nDecoupling schemes are designed to minimize the bypassing \nimpedance at all frequencies with a parallel combination of \ncapacitors. Chip capacitors of 0.01 μF or 0.001 μF (X7R or NPO) are critical and should be as close as possible to the amplifier package. Larger chip capacitors, such as the 0.1 μF capacitor, can be shared among a few closely spaced active components in the same signal path. A 10 μF tantalum \ncapacitor is less critical for high frequency bypassing and, in \nmost cases, only one per board is needed at the supply inputs. \nGROUNDING \nA ground plane layer is important in densely packed PC boards \nto spread the current-minimizing parasitic inductances. \nHowever, an understanding of where the current flows in a circuit is critical to implementing effective high speed circuit design. The length of the current path is directly proportional to \nthe magnitude of parasitic inductances and thus the high \nfrequency impedance of the path. High speed currents in an \ninductive ground return create an unwanted voltage noise. The lengths of the high frequency bypass capacitor leads are \nmost critical. A parasitic inductance in the bypass grounding works against the low impedance created by the bypass capacitor. Place the ground leads of the bypass capacitors at the \nsame physical location. Because load currents flow from the \nsupplies as well, the ground for the load impedance should be at the same physical location as the bypass capacitor grounds. For the larger value capacitors, which are intended to be effective at lower frequencies, the current return path distance is less critical. \nINPUT CAPACITANCE \nAlong with bypassing and ground, high speed amplifiers can  be sensitive to parasitic capacitance between the inputs and \nground. A few pF of capacitance reduces the input impedance  \nat high frequencies, in turn increasing the amplifier’s gain and causing peaking of the frequency response or even oscillations, if severe enough. It is recommended that the external passive components, which are connected to the input pins, be placed \nas close as possible to the inputs to avoid parasitic capacitance. \nThe ground and power planes must be kept at a distance of at \nleast 0.05 mm from the input pins on all layers of the board. \nINPUT-TO-OUTPUT COUPLING \nThe input and output signal traces should not be parallel to \nminimize capacitive coupling between the inputs and output \nand to avoid any positive feedback. \n \n AD8091/AD8092\n \nRev. C | Page 13 of 20 DRIVING CAPACITIVE LOADS \nA highly capacitive load reacts with the output of the amplifiers, \ncausing a loss in phase margin and subsequent peaking or even oscillation, as shown in \nFigure 29  and Figure 30 . There are two \nmethods to effectively minimize its effect. \n• Put a small value resistor in series with the output to isolate the load capacitor from the amplifier’s output stage. \n• Increase the phase margin with higher noise gains or by adding a pole with a parallel resistor and capacitor from −IN to the output. \n8\n–12–10–8–6–4–20246\n0.1 500 100 11 0\n02859-029\nFREQUENCY (MHz)GAIN (dB)\nVS = 5V\nG = +1\nRL= 2kΩ\nCL= 50pF\nVO= 200mV p-p\n \nFigure 29.

However, for some functions, such as A/D conversion, it is not desirable to have the sync pulses on the video signal. These pulses reduce the dynamic range of the \nvideo signal and do not provide any useful information for such \na function. \nA sync stripper removes the synchronizing pulses from a video \nsignal while passing all the useful video information. Figure 35  \nshows a practical single-supply circuit that uses only a single AD8091. It is capable of directly driving a reverse terminated \nvideo line. \nThe video signal plus sync is applied to the noninverting input \nwith the proper termination. The amplifier gain is set equal to 2 \nvia the two 1 kΩ resistors in the feedback circuit. A bias voltage \nmust be applied to R1 for the input signal to have the sync \npulses stripped at the proper level. \nThe blanking level of the input video pulse is the desired place \nto remove the sync information. The amplifier multiplies this level by 2. This level must be at ground at the output in order for the sync stripping action to take place. Because the gain of \nthe amplifier from the input of R1 to the output is −1, a voltage \nequal to 2 × V\nBLANK  must be applied to make the blanking level \ncome out at ground. \n02859-035AD8091+\nR2\n1kΩ\nR1\n1kΩ\n+0.8V\n(OR 2 × VBLANK )100ΩTO A/D3V OR 5V\n3\n246710µF 0.1µFVBLANK\nVINGROUND+0.4VVIDEO WITH SYNC\nGROUNDVIDEO WITHOUT SYN C\n \nFigure 35. Sync Stripper \nSINGLE-SUPPLY COMPOSITE VIDEO LINE DRIVER \nMany composite video signals have their blanking level at \nground and have video information that is both positive and \nnegative. Such signals require dual-supply amplifiers to pass \nthem. However, by ac level-shifting, a single-supply amplifier \ncan be used to pass these signals. The following complications \nmay arise from such techniques. \nSignals of bounded peak-to-peak amplitude that vary in duty \ncycle require larger dynamic swing capacity than their (bounded) peak-to-peak amplitude after they are ac-coupled. As a worst case, the dynamic signal swing approaches twice the \npeak-to-peak value. One of two conditions that define the \nmaximum dynamic swing requirements is a signal that is mostly low but goes high with a duty cycle that is a small fraction of a percent. The opposite condition defines the second \ncondition. \nThe worst case of composite video is not quite this demanding. \nOne bounding condition is a signal that is mostly black for an \nentire frame but has a white (full amplitude) minimum width \nspike at least once in a frame. \nThe other extreme is a full white video signal. The blanking \nintervals and sync tips of such a signal have negative-going excursions in compliance with the composite video specifications. The combination of horizontal and vertical blanking intervals limit such a signal to being at the highest (white) level for a maximum of about 75% of the time. \nAs a result of the duty cycles between the two extremes, a 1 V  \np-p composite video signal that is multiplied by a gain of 2 \nrequires about 3.2 V p-p of dynamic voltage swing at the output for an op amp to pass a composite video signal of arbitrary \nvarying duty cycle without distortion. \n AD8091/AD8092\n \nRev. C | Page 15 of 20 Some circuits use a sync tip clamp to hold the sync tips at a \nrelatively constant level to lower the amount of dynamic signal swing required. However, these circuits can have artifacts like sync tip compression unless they are driven by a source with a \nvery low output impedance. The AD8091/AD8092 have \nadequate signal swing when running on a single 5 V supply to \nhandle an ac-coupled composite video signal. The feedback circuit provides unity gain for the dc biasing of \nthe input and provides a gain of 2 for any signals that are in the video bandwidth. The output is ac-coupled and terminated to \ndrive the line. \nThe capacitor values provide minimum tilt or field time \ndistortion of the video signal. These values are required for \nvideo that is considered to be studio or broadcast quality. \nHowever, if a lower consumer grade of video, sometimes referred to as consumer video, is all that is desired, the values and the cost of the capacitors can be reduced by as much as a \nfactor of 5 with minimum visible degradation in the picture. The input to the circuit shown in Figure 36  is a standard \ncomposite (1 V p-p) video signal that has the blanking level at \nground. The input network level shifts the video signal by means of ac coupling. The noninverting input of the op amp is biased to half of the supply voltage. \n02859-036AD80915V\n+4.99kΩ\n10µF\n47µF\n+4.99kΩ\n10kΩRT\n75Ω\nRG\n1kΩRF\n1kΩRBT\n75Ω\nRL\n75ΩVOUTCOMPOSITE\nVIDEO IN+\n220µF0.1µF3\n24671000µF0.1µF 10µF\n+\n \nFigure 36.
