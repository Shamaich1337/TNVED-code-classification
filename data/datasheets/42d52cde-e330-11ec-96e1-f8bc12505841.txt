The STEALTH family exhibits low reverse recovery\ncurrent (I\nRR) and exceptionally soft recovery under typical operating\nconditions. This device is intended for use as a free wheeling or boost\ndiode in power supplies and other power switching applications.The low I\nRR and short ta phase reduce loss in switching transistors.\nThe soft recovery minimizes ringing, expanding the rangeof conditions under which the diode may be operated without the useof additional snubber circuitry. Consider using the STEALTH diodewith an SMPS IGBT to provide the most efficient and highest power\ndensity design at lower cost.\nFeatures\n•Stealth Recovery t rr = 300 ns (@ I F = 18 A)\n•Max Forward V oltage, V F = 3.3 V (@ T C = 25 °C)\n•1200 V Reverse V oltage and High Reliability\n•Avalanche Energy Rated\n•These Devices are Pb −Free and are RoHS Compliant\nApplications\n•Hard Switched PFC Boost Diode\n•UPS Free Wheeling Diode\n•Motor Drive FWD\n•SMPS FWD\n•Snubber Diode\nwww. onsemi.com\nMARKING DIAGRAM\n$Y = ON Semiconductor Logo\n&Z = Assembly Plant Code\n&3 = Numeric Date Code&K = Lot CodeR18120G2, \nR18120S3S = Specific Device Code$Y&Z&3&K\nR18120G2\nORDERING INFORMATION\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information on page 2 ofthis data sheet.KTO−247−2LD\nCASE 340CL\nD2PAK−3 (TO−263, 3−LEAD)\nCASE 418AJ$Y&Z&3&K\nR18120S3SANODE\nCATHODECATHODE\n(BOTTOM SIDEMETAL)\nANODEN/CCATHODE \n(FLANGE)\nASYMBOL\nISL9R18120G2, ISL9R18120S3S\nwww. onsemi.com\n2DEVICE MAXIMUM RATINGS (TC = 25 °C unless otherwise noted)\nParameter Symbol Ratings Unit\nRepetitive Peak Reverse Voltage VRRM 1200 V\nWorking Peak Reverse Voltage VRWM 1200 V\nDC Blocking Voltage VR 1200 V\nAverage Rectified Forward Current (T C = 92 °C) IF(AV) 18 A\nRepetitive Peak Surge Current (20 kHz Square Wave) IFRM 36 A\nNon−repetitive Peak Surge Current (Halfwave 1 Phase 60 Hz) IFSM 200 A\nPower Dissipation PD 125 W\nAvalanche Energy (1 A, 40 mH) EAVL 20 mJ\nOperating and Storage Temperature Range TJ, TSTG −55 to +175 °C\nMaximum Temperature for Soldering\nLeads at 0.063 in (1.6 mm) from Case for 10 s\nPackage Body for 10 sTL\nTPKG300\n260°C\n°C\nStresses exceeding those listed in the Maximum Ratings table may damage the device.
