General description\nThe PCA9555A is a low-voltage 16-bit Genera l Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) expander \nwith interrupt and weak pull-up resistors for I2C-bus/SMBus applications. NXP I/O \nexpanders provide a simple solution when additional I/Os are needed while keeping \ninterconnections to a minimum,  for example, in ACPI power switches, sensors, push \nbuttons, LEDs, fan control, etc.\nIn addition to providing a flexible set of GPIOs, the wide V DD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V \nallows the PCA9555A to interface with next-generation microprocessors and \nmicrocontrollers where supply levels are dropping down to conserve power.The PCA9555A contains the PCA9555 register set of four pairs of 8-bit Configuration, \nInput, Output, and Polarity Inversion registers.\nThe PCA9555A is a pin-to-pin replacement to the PCA9555 and other industry-standard \ndevices. A more fully featured device, the PCAL9555A, is available with Agile I/O \nfeatures. See the respective data sheet for more details.\nThe PCA9555A open-drain interrupt (INT\n) output is activated when any input state differs \nfrom its corresponding Input Port register st ate and is used to indicate to the system \nmaster that an input state has changed.INT\n can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt \nsignal on this line, the remote I/O can inform  the microcontroller if there is incoming data \non its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCA9555A can \nremain a simple slave device.The device outputs have 25 mA sink capabilitie s for directly driving LEDs while consuming \nlow device current.The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values and initializes the device state \nmachine.\nAll input/output pins have weak pull-up resist ors connected to them to eliminate external \ncomponents.\nThree hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) select the fixed I\n2C-bus address and allow up to eight \ndevices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus.PCA9555A\nLow-voltage 16-bit I2C-bus I/O port with interrupt and \nweak pull-up\nRev. 1.1 — 6 October 2015 Product data sheet\nPCA9555A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2015.

The input voltage may be raised above V DD to a maximum of 5.5 V. \nIf the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and either V\nDD or V SS.

At that time, the reset condition is \nreleased and the PCA9555A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine initializes to \ntheir default states. After that, V DD must be lowered to below V PORF  and back up to the \noperating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 8.2 “ Power-on reset requirements ”.\n6.5 Interrupt output\nAn interrupt is generated by any  rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode. \nAfter time t v(INT), the signal INT  is valid. The interrupt is reset when data on the port \nchanges back to the original value or when data is read form the port that generated the \ninterrupt (see Figure 10  and Figure 11 ). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the \nacknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL \nsignal. Interrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very \nshort) due to the resetting of the interrupt du ring this pulse. Any change of the I/Os after \nresetting is detected and is transmitted as INT .\nA pin configured as an output cannot cause an  interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output \nto an input may cause a false interrupt to occu r, if the state of the pin does not match the \ncontents of the Input Port register.\n7. Bus transactions\nThe PCA9555A is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and \nPCA9555A through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The two communication \nlines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be \nconnected to a positive supply via a pull-up re sistor when connected to the output stages \nof a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\n7.1 Writing to the port registers\nData is transmitted to the PCA9555A by sending the device address and setting the least \nsignificant bit to a logic 0 (see Figure 4 “ PCA9555A device address ”). The command byte \nis sent after the address an d determines which register will receive the data following the \ncommand byte.\nEight registers within the PCA9555A are configur ed to operate as four register pairs. The \nfour pairs are input port, output port, polarity inversion, configuration registers. After \nsending data to one register, the next data byte is sent to the other register in the pair (see \nFigure 7  and Figure 8 ). For example, if the first byte is sent to Output Port 1 (register 3), \nthe next byte is stored in Output Port 0 (register 2).\nThere is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this \nway, the host can continuously update a register  pair independently of  the other registers, \nor the host can simply update a single register.\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x x x xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xx xx xxxxx \nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx x x \nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx \nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx\nPCA9555A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2015.

The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register will \nbe accessed. After a restart, th e device address is sent again, but this time the least \nsignificant bit is set to a logic 1. Data from the register defined by the command byte is \nsent by the PCA9555A (see Figure 9 , Figure 10  and Figure 11 ). Data is clocked into the \nregister on the falling edge of the acknowledge clock pulse. After the first byte is read, \nadditional bytes may be read but the data now reflects the information in the other register \nin the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 is read, the next byte read is Input Port 0. There is \nno limit on the number of data bytes received  in one read transmission, but on the final \nbyte received the bus master must not acknowledge the data.\nAfter a subsequent restart, the command byte contains the value of the next register to be \nread in the pair.

Application design-in information\n \n8.1 Minimizing I DD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs\nWhen the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to V DD through a \nresistor as shown in Figure 12 . Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the I/O \nVI is about 1.2 V less than V DD. The supply current, I DD, increases as V I becomes lower \nthan V DD.\nDesigns needing to minimize current consumpt ion, such as battery power applications, \nshould consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to V DD when the LED is off. \nFigure 13  shows a high value resistor  in parallel with the LED. Figure 14  shows V DD less \nthan the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O V I \nat or above V DD and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.Device address configured as  0100 000X for this example.\nP0_0, P0_2, P0_3 configured as outputs.\nP0_1, P0_4, P0_5 configured as inputs.\nP0_6, P0_7 and (P1_0 to P1_7) configured as inputs.\n(1) Internal pull-up may be used to eliminate external components.\nFig 12.

Power-on reset requires that the device go through a power cycle to be complete ly reset. This reset also happens when the device is \npowered on for the first time in an application.\nThe two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 15\n and Figure 16 .\n \nTable 13  specifies the performance of the power-on reset feature for PCA9555A for both \ntypes of power-on reset.Fig 13.

The glitch width (t w(gl)VDD ) and glitch height ( \uf044VDD(gl) ) are dependent on each \nother. The bypass capacitance, source impedan ce, and device impedance are factors that \naffect power-on reset performance. Figure 17  and Table 13  provide more information on \nhow to measure thes e specifications.\n \nVPOR is critical to the power-on reset. V POR is the voltage level at which the reset condition \nis released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to \ntheir default states.

Since these pull-up resistors are internal to the device \nitself, they contribute to the current consumption of the device and must be considered in \nthe overall system design.\nIf the resistor is configured as a pull-up, that is, connected to V DD, a current will flow from \nthe V DD pin through the resistor to ground when the pin is held LOW. This current will \nappear as additional I DD upsetting any current consumption measurements.\nThe pull-up resistors are simple resistors and the current is linear with voltage. The \nresistance specification for t hese devices spans from 50 k \uf057 with a nominal 100 k \uf057 value. \nAny current flow through these resistors is ad ditive by the number of pins held LOW and \nthe current can be calculated by Ohm’s law.

Handling information\nAll input and output pins are protected ag ainst ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under \nnormal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as \ndescribed in JESD625-A  or equivalent standards.\n17. Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n17.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not \nsuitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n17.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from \na standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, \nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n17.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\nPCA9555A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2015.

It is imperative that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 20  and 21\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 32 .Table 20.
