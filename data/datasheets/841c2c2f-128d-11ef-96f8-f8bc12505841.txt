APDS-9700 has artiﬁcial light immunity and is also operational under the sun. Design ﬂexibility is optimized as APDS-9700 can be paired up with an integrated proximity sen-sor or discrete pair solution.\nAPDS-9700 can be disabled to maximize power savings \nand  battery life in applications such as portable or bat-tery-operated devices.  The LED current of the optical proximity sensors can be conﬁgured to diﬀerent levels using a limiting resistor at the LEDA pin.  APDS-9700 also provides user ﬂexibility to control the pulse width with suitable burst rate, duty cycle and frequency that can re-duce power consumption.  These low power consump-tion features makes it also ideal for low power mobile and handheld devices.\nAPDS-9700 is capable of operating at voltage supply rang-\ning from 2.4 V to 3.6 V. APDS-9700 has two separate out-put pins for analog and digital outputs.  This provides ﬂex-ibility to use either the analog or digital output (or both) depending on the requirements of the application.\nThe device is packaged in 8-pin QFN package measuring \n0.55mm(H) x 2mm(W) x 2mm(L).\nOrdering Information\nPart Number Package Shipping Option\nAPDS-9700-020 Tape & Reel 2500\nApplication Support Information\nThe Application Engineering Group is available to assist you with the application design associated with APDS-9700 module.

The temperature proﬁle is divided into four process zones, each with diﬀerent /g39T//g39time temperature \nchange rates or duration. The /g39T//g39time rates or duration \nare detailed in the above table.  The temperatures are measured at the component to printed circuit board con-nections.\nIn process zone P1, the PC board and APDS-9700 pins are \nheated to a temperature of 150°C to activate the ﬂux in the solder paste. The temperature ramp up rate, R1, is lim-ited to 3°C per second to allow for even heating of both the PC board and APDS-9700 pins.\nProcess zone P2 should be of suﬃcient time duration (100 \nto 180 seconds) to dry the solder paste. The temperature is raised to a level just below the liquidus point of the sol-der, usually 200°C (392°F). \nProcess zone P3 is the solder reﬂow zone. In zone P3, the \ntemperature is quickly raised above the liquidus point of solder to 255°C (491°F) for optimum results. The dwell time \nabove the liquidus point of solder should be between 20 and 40 seconds. It usually takes about 20 seconds to as-sure proper coalescing of the solder balls into liquid solder and the formation of good solder connections. Beyond a dwell time of 40 seconds, the intermetallic growth within the solder connections becomes excessive, resulting in the formation of weak and unreliable connections. The temperature is then rapidly reduced to a point below the solidus temperature of the solder, usually 200°C (392°F), to allow the solder within the connections to freeze solid. \nProcess zone P4 is the cool down after solder freeze. The \ncool down rate, R5, from the liquidus point of the solder to 25°C (77°F) should not exceed 6°C per second maximum. This limitation is necessary to allow the PC board and APDS-9700 pins to change dimensions evenly, putting minimal stresses on the APDS-9700.\nIt is recommended to perform reﬂow soldering no more \nthan twice.Figure 15.
