The modulator features an input 3dB bandwidth of\n100MHz, and can generate output frequencie s of between 45MHz and 2700MHz, making it\nsuitable for a wide range of applications.\nThe fractional-N synthesizer takes advantage of an advanced sigma-delta architecture that\ndelivers ultra-fine step sizes and low spurious products. The synthesizer/VCO, combined with\nan external loop filter, allows the user to generate local oscillator (LO) signals from 90MHz to\n5400MHz. The LO signal is buffered and routed to  a high accuracy quadrature divider (/2) that\ndrives the balanced I and Q mixers. The output of the mixers are summed and applied to a dif-ferential RF output stage. This device also features a differential input for an external VCO or LO\nsource.\nDevice programming is achieved via a simple 3-wire serial interface. In addition, a unique pro-\ngramming mode allows up to four devices to be controlled from a common serial bus. This elim-inates the need for separate chip-select control lines between each device and the host\ncontroller. Up to six general purpose outputs are provided, which can be used to access internal\nsignals (the LOCK signal, for example) or to control front end components. The device is opti-\nmized for low power operation, consuming typically only 135mA from a 3V supply.Features\n\uf06eRF Output Frequency Range \n45MHz to 2700MHz\n\uf06eFractional-N Synthesizer with Very Low Spurious Levels\n\uf06eTypical Step Size 1.5Hz\n\uf06eFully Integrated Wideband VCOs and LO Buffers\n\uf06eIntegrated Phase Noise <0.2° rms at 1GHz\n\uf06e-40dBc Unadjusted Carrier Suppression\n\uf06e-40dBc Unadjusted Sideband Suppression\n\uf06e100MHz Baseband Input 3dB Bandwidth\n\uf06eVery Low Noise Floor              -162dBm/Hz Typical\n\uf06eOutput P1dB + 4dBm\n\uf06eOutput IP3 + 17dBm\n\uf06e2.7V to 3.3V Power Supply\n\uf06e135mA Typical Current Consumption\n\uf06eSerial Programming Interface\nApplications\n\uf06eSatellite Communications\n\uf06eQPSK/QAM Modulators\n\uf06eWireless Broadband\n\uf06ePoint-to-Point\n\uf06eSoftware Defined Radios\nDS140110Package: QFN, 32-Pin, 5mm x 5mm\nRFMD2081\n2 of 18RFMD2081\nDS1401107628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570 or sales-support@rfmd.com.Absolute Maximum Ratings\nParameter Rating Unit\nSupply Voltage (VDD) -0.5 to +3.6 V\nInput Voltage (VIN), any pin -0.3 to VDD +0.3 V\nLO Input Power +15 dBm\nOperating Temperature Range -40 to +85 °C\nStorage Temperature Range -65 to +150 °C\nParameterSpecificationUnit ConditionMin.

It features a\nhigh accuracy LO quadrature divider followed by buffer circuits  which drive the I and Q mixers of the modulator with the quadra -\nture LO signals. The RFMD2081 has an integrated voltage reference and low drop out regulators supplying critical circuit\nblocks such as the VCOs and synthesizer.  Synthesizer programming, device configuration and control are achieved through a\nmixture of hardware and software controls. All on-chip register s are programmed through a simple  three-wire serial interface.\nVCO\nThe VCO core in the RFMD2081 consists of three VCOs which, in conjunction with the integrated LO dividers of /1 to /32, cover\nthe frequency range of 90MHz to 5400MHz. The modulator quadrature divider provides a further fixed divide by two to give the\ncenter frequency range at the modulator output of 45MHz to 2700MHz.\nEach VCO has 128 overlapping bands which are used to achiev e low VCO gain and optimal phase noise performance across\nthe whole tuning range. The chip automatically selects the correct VCO (VCO auto-select) and the correct VCO band (VCO\ncoarse tuning) to generate the desired LO frequency based on the values programmed into the PLL1 and PLL2 registers banks. \nThe VCO auto-select and VCO coarse tuning are triggered every time  ENBL is taken high, or if the PLL re-lock self clearing bit is\nprogrammed high. Once the correct VCO and band have been sele cted the PLL will lock onto the correct frequency. During the\nband selection process fixed capacitance elements are progressi vely connected to the VCO resonant circuit until the VCO is\noscillating at approximately the correct frequency. The output of  this band selection, CT_CAL, is made available in the read-\nback register. A value of 127 or 0 in this register indicates that the coarse tuning was unsuccessful, and this should also be\nindicated by the CT_FAILED flag also avai lable in the read-back register. A value between 1 and 126 indicates a successful cal-\nibration, the actual value being dependent on the desired frequency as well as process variation for a particular device. \nThe band select process will center the VCO tuning voltage at about 0.8V, compensating for manufacturing tolerances and pro-\ncess variation as well as environmental factors including temperat ure. In applications where the device is left enabled at the\nsame LO frequency for some time it is recommended that au tomatic band selection be performed for every 30°C change in\ntemperature. This assumes an active loop filter. \nThe RFMD2081 features a differential LO input to allow the mixer to be driven from an external LO source. The fractional-N PLL\ncan be used with an external VCO driven into this LO input, which may be useful to reduce phase noise in some applications.\nThis may also require an external op-amp, dependant on the tuning voltage required by the external VCO.\nFractional-N PLL\nThe RFMD2081 contains a charge-pump based fractional-N phase locked loop (PLL) for controlling the three VCOs. The PLLincludes automatic calibration systems to counteract the effect s of process and environmental variations, ensuring repeatable\nloop response and phase noise performance. As well as the VCO auto-select and coarse tuning, there is a loop filter calibrationmechanism which can be enabled if required. This operates by adjusting the charge pump current to maintain loop bandwidth.\nThis can be useful for applications where the LO is tuned over a wide frequency range.\nThe PLL has been designed to use a reference frequency of between 10MHz and 104MHz from an external source, which is\ntypically a temperature controlled crystal oscillator (TCXO). A re ference divider (divide by 1 to divide by 7) is supplied and\nshould be programmed to limit the frequency at the phase detector to a maximum of 52MHz. \nTwo PLL programming banks are provided, the first bank is preceded by the label PLL1 and the second bank is preceded by the\nlabel PLL2. The active register bank is selected by the state of the MODE pin, low for PLL1 and high for PLL2. \nThe VCO outputs are first divided down in a high frequency presca lar. The output of this high frequency prescalar then enters\nthe N divider, which is a fractional divi der containing a dual-modulus prescalar and a digitally spur-compensated fractional\nsequence generator. This allows very fine  frequency steps and minimizes fractional sp urs. The fractional energy is randomized\nand appears as fractional noise at frequency offsets above 100kHz which will be attenuated by the loop filter. An external loop\nfilter is used, giving flexibility in setting loop bandwi dth for optimizing phase noise and lock time for example.\n6 of 18RFMD2081\nDS1401107628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570 or sales-support@rfmd.com.The synthesizer step size is ty pically 1.5Hz when using a 26MHz reference freque ncy. The exact step size for any reference and\nLO frequency can be calculated using the following formula:\n(FREF * P) / (R * 224 * LO_DIV*2)\nWhere FREF is the reference frequency, R is the reference division rati o, P is the prescalar division ratio, and LO_DIV is the LO\ndivider value.\nPin 26 (GPO4) can be configured as a lock detect pin. The lock status is also available in the read-back register. The lock det ect\nfunction is a window detector on the VCO tuning voltage. The lock flag will be high to show PLL lock which corresponds to the\nVCO tuning voltage being within the specified range, typically 0.30V to 1.25V. \nThe lock time of the PLL will depend on a number of factors;  including the loop bandwidth and the reference frequency at the\nphase detector. This clock frequency determ ines the speed at which the state machin e and internal calibrations run. A 52MHz\nphase detector frequency will give fastest lock times, of typically <50 \uf06dsecs when using the PLL re-lock bit.\nPhase Detector and Charge Pump\nThe phase detector provides a current output to drive an active loop filter. The charge pump output current is set by the value\ncontained in the P1_CP_DEF and P2_CP_DEF fields in the loop filter configuration register. The charge pump current is givenby approximately 3 \uf06dA/bit, and the fields are 6 bits long . This gives default value (31) of 93 \uf06dA and maximum value (63) of\n189\uf06dA.\nIf the automatic loop bandwidth calibration is enabled the char ge pump current is set by the calibration algorithm based upon\nthe VCO gain. \nThe phase detector will operate with a maximum input frequency of 52MHz.\nLoop Filter\nThe active loop filter is implemented using the on-chip low noise op-amp, with external resistors and capacitors. The op-amp\ngives a tuning voltage range of typically +0. 1V to +2.4V. The internal configuration of  the chip is shown below with the recom-\nmended active loop filter. The loop filter shown is designed to give lowest integrat ed phase noise, for reference frequencies o f\nbetween 26MHz and 52MHz. The external loop filter components gi ve the flexibility to optimize the loop response for any par-\nticular application and combination of reference and VCO frequencies.\nExternal Reference\nThe RFMD2081 have been designed to use an external referenc e such as a TCXO. The typical input will be a 0.8Vp-p clipped\nsine wave, which should be AC-coupled into the reference input. When the PLL is not in use, it may be desirable to turn off the\ninternal reference circuits, by setting the REFSTBY bit low, to minimize current draw while in standby mode.

This is set by the SU_WAIT\nbits. This will allow the clock to be stable and immediately avai lable when the ENBL bit is asserted high, allowing the PLL to\nassume normal operation. \nIf the current consumption of the reference circuits in standby mode, typically 2mA, is not critical, then the REFSTBY bit can be\nset high. This allows the fastest startup and lock time after ENBL is taken high.\nIQ Modulator\nThe IQ modulator core of the RFMD208 1 is wideband covering from 45MHz to 2 700MHz. It has been designed to achieve\nexceptional linearity for the amount of DC power consumed.\nThe modulator mixer cores have four coarse  gain/current settings. Each setting steps the gain and linearity by 6dB and can be\nused to optimize performance or reduce power consumption.\nThe differential I and Q baseband inputs  have 3dB bandwidth of 100MHz, and their input impedance is dominated by 10K \uf057\npull down resistors on each pin, as show n in the diagram below, so presenting a 20K \uf057 differential impedance. A common\nmode DC bias voltage of around +1.3V is required to set the current through the mixer cores for optimal performance. The off-\nset between the common mode voltages on the differential pins can be adjusted to minimize LO leakage at the modulator out-\nput. The baseband input signals will be typically of the order of  1Vp-p differential. If required the phase and amplitude of th e I\nand Q signals can be adjusted to reduce the level of the unwanted sideband signal at the modulator output. \nThe modulator output is differential and requires a balun and si mple matching circuit optimized to the specific application fre -\nquencies. The modulator output pins are also used to source current for the modulator mixer circuits, about 20mA on each pin.\nThis is usually via a center-tapped balun or by RF chokes in the external matching circuitry to the supply.\nT h e  m o d u l a t o r  o u t p u t  i s  h i g h  i m p e d a n c e ,  c o n s i s t i n g  o f  a p p r o x i m a t e l y  2 K \uf057 resistance in parallel  with some capacitance,\napproximately 1pF. The modulator output does not require a conjugate matching ne twork. It is a constant current output which\nwill drive a real differential load of typically 200 \uf057. Since the mixer output is a constant current source, a higher resistance load\nwill give higher output voltage and gain. A shunt inductor can be used to resonate with the mixer output capacitance at the fre -\nquency of interest.

At higher output frequenc ies the inductance of the bond wires (abo ut 0.5nH on each pin) becomes more sig-\nnificant. The following diagram is a simple model of the modulator output:\nIt is recommended to use a 4:1 balun on the modulator output, converting from the single ended 50 \uf057 system to a 200 \uf057 \ndifferential load. The RFMD2081 evaluation board has an RFXF8553 wideband transmi ssion line transformer. \nSerial Interface\nAll on-chip registers in the RFMD2081 are programmed using a proprietary 3-wire serial bus which supports both write and\nread operations. Synthesizer programming, device configuration and control are achieved through a mixture of hardware and\nsoftware controls. Certain functions and operations require the use of hardware controls via the ENBL, MODE, and RESETX\npins in addition to programming via the serial bus. Alternativel y there is the option to control the chip completely via the se rial\nbus. \nThe serial data interface can be configured  for 4-wire bus operation, by setting the \'4WIRE\' bit in the SDI_CTRL register high.\nThen pin 26 is used as the data out pin,  and pin 32 is the serial data in pin. \nHardware Control\nThree hardware control pins are provided: ENBL, MODE, and RESETX.\nThe ENBL pin has two functions: to enable the analog circuits in the chip and to trigger the VCO auto-selection and coarse tun-\ning mechanisms. The VCO auto-selection and coarse tuning are initiated when the ENBL pin is taken high. Every time the fre-\nquency of the synthesizer is repr ogrammed, ENBL has to be asserted high to initiate these mechanisms and then to initiate the\nPLL locking. Alternatively following the programming of a new frequency the PLL re-lock self clearing bit could be used.\nIf the device is left in the enabled state for long periods, it is recommended that VCO auto-selection and coarse tuning (band\nselection) is performed for every 30°C change in temperature. Th e lock detect flag can be used to indicate when to perform\nthe VCO calibration, it shows that the VCO tuning volt age has drifted significantly with changing temperature.\nThe RESETX pin is a hardware reset control that will reset all di gital circuits to their startup state when asserted low. The d evice\nincludes a power-on-reset function, so this pin should not normal ly be required, in which case it should be connected to the\npositive supply.\nThe MODE pin controls which PLL programming register bank is active.\nSerial Data Interface Control\nThe normal mode of operation uses the 3-wire serial data inte rface to program the device registers, and three extra hardware\ncontrol lines; MODE, ENBL and RESETX. \nWhen the device is under software control, achieved by setting  the SIPIN bit in the SDI_CTRL register high, then the hardware\ncan be controlled via the SDI_CTRL register . When this is the case, the three hardware control lines are not required. If the\ndevice is under software control, pins 1 and 9 can be configured as general purpose outputs (GPO).RFMD2081 \nRF Output\n0.5nH0.5nH\n1K\uf057\n1pF\n1K\uf057\n9 of 18RFMD2081\nDS1401107628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570 or sales-support@rfmd.com.Multi-Slice Mode\nThe Multi-Slice mode of operation allows up to four chips to be controlled from a common serial bus. The device address pins,\n(15 and 16) ADD1 and ADD2, are used to set the address of each part.\nOn power up, and after a Reset, the devices ignore the address pins ADD1 and ADD2 and any data  presented to the serial bus\nwill be programmed into all the devices. However, once the ADDR bit in the SDI_CTRL register is set each device then adopts\nan address according to the state of the address pins on the device.\nGeneral Purpose Outputs\nThe general purpose outputs (GPOs) can be controlled via the GPO register, and will depend on the state of MODE since they\ncan be set in different states corresponding to either path 1 or 2. The GPOs can be used for example to drive LEDs, or to con-\ntrol external circuitry such as  switches or low power LNAs. \nEach GPO pin can supply up to and above 20mA load current. The output voltage of the GPO high state will drop with increased\ncurrent drive, by approximately 25mV/mA. Similarly the output voltage of the GPO low state will rise with increased current,\nagain by approximately 25mV/mA.\nProgramming Information\nPlease refer to the register ma p and programming guides which are available for download from \nhttp://rfmd.com/products/IntSynthModulator/.\nEvaluation Boards\nThe evaluation board for the RFMD2081 is provided as part of a design kit, along with the necessary cables and programmingsoftware tool to enable full evaluation of the device.
