The LT4275A is fully compat-\nible with IEEE 802.3. The LT4275B is an IEEE 802.3at \ncompliant, Type 2 (PoE +) PD delivering up to 25.5W.

Powered device \n(PD) equipment  vendors  are running  into the 25.5 W power  \nlimit established by the IEEE 802.3 standard. The LT4275A \nallows higher power while maintaining backwards com-\npatibility with existing PSE systems. The LT4275 utilizes \na low R DS(ON)  N-channel MOSFET to maximize efficiency \nand delivered power. Heat is also reduced, easing thermal \ndesign.\nMODES  OF OPERA\nTION\nThe \nLT4275 has several modes of operation depending \non the input voltage sequence applied to the VPORT pin. \nThese modes include 25kΩ signature detection, classifica-\ntion, mark, inrush and powered on.D\nETECTION\nDuring \ndetection, the PSE looks for a 25kΩ signature \nresistor which identifies the device as a PD. The PSE will \napply two voltages in the range of 2.8V to 10V and measure \nthe corresponding currents. Figure 1 shows the detection \nvoltages. The PSE calculates the signature resistance using  \na ∆V/∆I measurement technique.\nThe LT4275 presents its precision, temperature-compen-\nsated 24.4k resistor between the VPORT and GND pins, \nallowing the PSE to recognize a PD is present and request-\ning power  to be applied. The LT4275 signature resistor is \nsmaller than 25k to compensate for the additional series resistance introduced by the IEEE required bridge. \nC\nLASSIFICA\nTION\nThe \ndetection/classification process varies depending on \nwhether the PSE is Type 1, Type 2, or L TPoE ++. A Type 2  \nPSE may use Type 1 classification signaling and later \nrenegotiate a higher power classification with the PD over \nthe data layer.\nA Type 1 PSE, after a successful detection, may apply a \nclassification probe voltage of 15.5V to 20.5V and mea-\nsure current. A Type 2 PSE may declare the availability of high power \nby performing 2-event ( Physical Layer) classification  \nor by communicating over the (Data Link Layer) high \nspeed data line. A Type 2 PD must recognize both types \nof communication. Since Layer 2 communications takes \nplace directly between the PSE and the PD application, the \nLT4275A/LT4275B responsibility ends with supporting \n2-event classification.\nIn 2-event classification, a Type 2 PSE probes for power \nclassification twice as shown in Figure 2. The LT4275A or \nLT4275B recognizes this and pulls the T2P pin down to \nsignal the load that Type 2 power is available. If an LT4275A \nsenses an L TPoE ++ PSE it alternates between pulling T2P \ndown  and floating T2P at a rate of f T2P.Figure 1. Type 1 Detect/Class Signaling Waveform\nFigure 2.

IEEE PSEs \nwill classify an L TPoE ++ PD as a Type 2 PD.\nSIGNA\nTURE  CORRUP\nT DURING  MARK\nDuring \nthe mark state, the LT4275 presents <11kΩ to the \nport as required by the IEEE specification.\nINRUSH  AND POWERED  ON\nOnce \nthe PSE detects and optionally classifies the PD, the \nPSE then powers on the PD. When the port voltage rises \nabove the V HSON threshold, it begins to source I GPU out of \nthe HSGATE pin. This  current flows into an external capaci-\ntor\n (CGATE in Figure 3) that causes a voltage to ramp up the \ngate of the external MOSFET. The external MOSFET acts as \na source follower and ramps the voltage up on the output \nbulk capacitor (C PORT in Figure 3) thereby determining the \ninrush current (I INRUSH  in Figure 3).\nTo meet IEEE requirements, design I INRUSH  to be approxi-\nmately 100mA. See equation below:\n  IINRUSH =IGPU•CPORT\nCGATE\nThe LT4275 internal charge pump provides an N-channel \nMOSFET solution, eliminating a larger and more costly \nP-channel FET.

Programming I INRUSHpower delivery and efficiency, reduces power and heat dissipation, and eases thermal design.\nThe PWRGD pin is held low by its open drain output until \nHSGATE charges up to approximately 7V above HSSRC. \nThe PWRGD pin is used to hold off the isolated power \nsupply until inrush is complete and the external MOSFET \nis fully enhanced. The HSGATE pin will remain high and \nthe PWRGD pin pulled down until the port voltage falls \nbelow V\nHSOFF  or the AUX pin is above V AUXT.\nAUXILIAR\nY SUPPL\nY OVERRIDE\nIf \nthe AUX pin is held above V AUXT, the LT4275 enters \nauxiliary  power  supply  override  mode. In this mode  \nthe signature resistor is disconnected, classification is \ndisabled, HSGATE is pulled down, and the PWRGD pin is \nallowed to float. The T2P pin pulls down on the LT4275A/\nLT4275B when no R CLS++ resistor is present. The T2P pin \nalternates between pulling down and floating at f T2P on the \nLT4275A when the R CLS++ resistor is present.\nLT4275\n8\n4275fapplica Tions inForMaTion\nThe AUX pin allows for setting the auxiliary supply turn on \n(VAUXON ) and turn off (V AUXOFF ) voltage thresholds. The \nauxiliary supply hysteresis voltage (V AUXHYS ) is set by \nsinking current (I AUXH) only when the AUX pin voltage is \nless than V AUXT. Use the following equations to set V AUXON  \nand V AUXOFF  via R1 and R2 in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. AUX Threshold and Hysteresis CalculationT ransient Voltage Suppressor\nThe LT4275 specifies an absolute maximum voltage of \n100V and is designed to tolerate brief overvoltage events. \nHowever, the pins that interface to the outside world can \nroutinely see excessive peak voltages. To protect the \nLT4275, install a unidirectional transient voltage suppres-\nsor (TVS ) such as an SMAJ58A between the port voltage \nand GND. This TVS  must be mounted near the LT4275.\nFor extremely high cable discharge and surge protection \ncontact Linear Technology Applications.\nClassification Resistor (R CLS and R CLS++)\nThe R CLS resistors set the classification load current cor-\nresponding to the PD power classification. Select the value \nof R CLS from Table 1 and connect the resistor between the \nRCLASS pin and GND, or float the RCLASS pin if class 0 \nis required. The resistor tolerance must be 1% or better  to \navoid \ndegrading the overall accuracy of the classification \ncircuit. For L TPoE ++ use the LT4275A and select the value \nof R CLS++ from Table 1 in addition to R CLS.\nPower Good Interface\nThe LT4275 provides a power good signal (PWRGD) to \nsimplify  the isolated  power supply design. The power good  \nsignal is used to delay isolated power supply startup until \nthe C PORT capacitor is fully charged.\nExposed PadThe LT4275A/LT4275B/LT4275C DFN package has an \nexposed pad that is internally electrically connected to \nGND. The exposed pad may only be connected to GND \non the printed circuit board.\nL\nA\nYOUT  CONSIDERA\nTIONS\nAvoid \nexcessive parasitic capacitance on the RCLASS \npin and place resistor R CLS close to the LT4275. For the \nLT4275A, place R CLS++ nearby as well.\nIt is strictly required for maximum protection to place the \ninput capacitor (C PD) and transient voltage suppressor as \nclose to the LT4275 as possible.L T4275A\nGND\n4275 F04AUXR1\nVAUX+\n–R2\n R1=VAUXON−VAUXOFF\nIAUXH=VAUXHYS\nIAUXH\nR2=R1\nVAUXOFF\nVAUXT−1\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nR1≥VAUX(MAX)−VAUXT\n1.4mA\nTHERMAL  PROTECTION\nThe \nIEEE 802.3 specification requires a PD to withstand \nany applied voltage from 0V to 57V indefinitely. During \nclassification, however, the power dissipation in the LT4275  \nmay be as high as 1.5W. The LT4275 can easily tolerate \nthis power for the maximum IEEE timing but will overheat \nif this condition persists abnormally.\nThe LT4275 includes a thermal protection feature which \nprotects itself from excessive heating. If the junction \ntemperature exceeds the overtemperature threshold, the \nLT4275 pulls down the HSGATE and PWRGD pins and \ndisables classification.\nEXTERNAL  INTERF\nACE AND COMPONENT  SELECTION\nInput Diode Bridge\nT\nhe input  diode  bridge  introduces  a voltage  drop that affects  \nthe voltage range for each mode of operation. The LT4275 \nis designed to tolerate these voltage drops.
