When the IC detects that the capacitor \nvoltage reaches 4.95V, the power -on start -up \nprocess ends  and the control circuit starts to \noutput PWM signals . \n \nConstant Voltage Mode  \nWhen the control circuit works,  it detects the \nvoltage of the FB pin synchronously  and \nsamples the output voltage. When the FB \nvoltage is lower than the internal reference \nvoltage,  control circuit will increase the duty \ncycle or frequency  to increase the output energy  and charge the energy storage inductor L1, the \noutput capacitor C5 and the load. When the \ninductor current reaches the internal reference \ncurrent Ipeak, control circuit turns off the \nintegrated HV power device and the energy \nstorage inductor L1 releases energy to the \noutput capacitor C5 and the load through the \ndiode D3, and the voltage of C5 charges C4 \nthrough D2. When the FB feedback signal \ndetects that the C4 voltage is high, control circuit \nwill reduce the duty cycle or frequency to reduce \nthe output energy to achieve the purpose of \nvoltage regulation. Referring to the typical \napplication diagram, the output voltage can be \nadjusted through the FB voltage divider circuit. \nIn practical applications, since the FB sampling \nof the output voltage is affected by the isolation \ndiode, minor adjustment  is required.
