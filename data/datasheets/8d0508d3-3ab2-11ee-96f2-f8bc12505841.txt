These devices guarantee data rates \nup to 52Mbps, even with a 3V power supply. Excellent  \npropagation delay (15ns max) and package-to-package \nskew time (8ns max) make these devices ideal for  \nmultidrop clock distribution applications.\nThe MAX3280E/MAX3281E/MAX3283E/MAX3284E \nhave true fail-safe circuitry, which guarantees a logic-high \nreceiver output when the receiver inputs are opened \nor shorted. The receiver output will be a logic high if \nall transmitters on a terminated bus are disabled (high \nimpedance). These devices feature 1/4-unit-load receiver \ninput impedance, allowing up to 128 receivers on the \nsame bus.\nThe MAX3280E is a single receiver available in a 5-pin \nSOT23 package. The MAX3281E/MAX3283E single \nreceivers have a receiver enable (EN or EN) function and \nare offered in a 6-pin SOT23 package. The MAX3284E \nfeatures a voltage logic pin that allows compatibility with \nlow-voltage logic levels, as in digital FPGAs/ASICs. On \nthe MAX3284E, the voltage threshold for a logic high \nis user-defined by setting V L in the range from 1.65V to \nVCC. The MAX3284E is also offered in a 6-pin SOT23 \npackage.\nApplications\n ●Clock Distribution\n ●Telecom Racks\n ●Base Stations\n ●Industrial Control\n ●Local Area Networks\n ●AutomotiveBenefits and Features\n ●ESD Protection:  \n ±15kV Human Body Model  \n ±6kV IEC 1000-4-2, Contact Discharge  \n ±12kV IEC 1000-4-2, Air-Gap Discharge\n ●Guaranteed 52Mbps Data Rate\n ●Guaranteed 15ns Receiver Propagation Delay\n ●Guaranteed 2ns Receiver Skew\n ●Guaranteed 8ns Package-to-Package Skew Time\n ●VL Pin for Connection to FPGAs/ASICs\n ●Allow Up to 128 Transceivers on the Bus  \n(1/4-unit-load)\n ●Tiny SOT23 Package\n ●True Fail-Safe Receiver\n ●-7V to +12V Common-Mode Range\n ●3V to 5.5V Power-Supply Range\n ●Enable (High and Low) Pins for Redundant Operation\n ●Three-State Output Stage (MAX3281E/MAX3283E)\n ●Thermal Protection Against Output Short Circuit\n ●AEC-Q100 (MAX3280EAUK/V+ Only)\n19-2320; Rev 7; 1/19Click here  for production status of specific part numbers.\nNote 1:  MAX3284E data rate is dependent on V L.+Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.\nT = Tape and reel.\n/V denotes an automotive qualified part.\nSelector GuideOrdering Information\nPART VL ENABLE DATA RATE PACKAGE\nMAX3280E — — 52Mbps 5-Pin SOT23\nMAX3281E — Active High 52Mbps 6-Pin SOT23\nMAX3283E — Active Low 52Mbps 6-Pin SOT23\nMAX3284E ✔ — 52Mbps (Note 1) 6-Pin SOT23PART TEMP RANGEPIN-\nPACKAGETOP\nMARK\nMAX3280E AUK+T -40°C to +125°C 5 SOT23 +ADVM\nMAX3280EAUK/V+T -40°C to +125°C 5 SOT23 +AFME\nMAX3281E AUT+T -40°C to +125°C 6 SOT23 +ABAT\nMAX3283E AUT+T -40°C to +125°C 6 SOT23 +ABAU\nMAX3284E AUT+T -40°C to +125°C 6 SOT23 +ABAV\nMAX3280E/MAX3281E/  \nMAX3283E/MAX3284E±15kV ESD-Protected 52Mbps, 3V to 5.5V,  \nSOT23 RS-485/RS-422 True Fail-Safe Receivers\n(All Voltages Referenced to GND)\nSupply Voltage (V CC) .............................................. -0.3V to +6V\nControl Input Voltage (EN, EN) ............................... -0.3V to +6V\nVL Input Voltage  ...................................................... -0.3V to +6V\nReceiver Input Voltage (A, B)  ............................. -7.5V to +12.5V\nReceiver Output Voltage (RO)  ................. -0.3V to (V CC + 0.3V)\nReceiver Output Voltage  \n(RO) (MAX3284E)  ................................... -0.3V to (V L + 0.3V)\nReceiver Output Short-Circuit Current  ......................

The fail-safe architecture guarantees \na high output signal if both input terminals are open or \nshorted together. See the True Fail-Safe  section. This \nfeature assures a stable and predictable output logic state \nwith any transmitter driving the line. These receivers func -\ntion with a 3.3V or 5V supply voltage and feature excellent \npropagation delay times (15ns).\nThe MAX3280E is a single receiver available in a 5-pin \nSOT23 package. The MAX3281E (EN, active high) and \nMAX3283E ( EN, active low) are single receivers that \nalso contain an enable pin. Both the MAX3281E and \nMAX3283E are available in a 6-pin SOT23 package. The \nMAX3284E is a single receiver that contains a V L pin, \nwhich allows communication with low-level logic included \nin digital FPGAs. The MAX3284E is available in a 6-pin \nSOT23 package.\nThe MAX3284E’s low-level logic application allows users \nto set the logic levels. A logic high level of 1.65V will limit \nthe maximum data rate to 20Mbps.\n±15kV ESD Protection\nESD-protection structures are incorporated on the \nreceiver input pins to protect against ESD encountered  \nduring handling and assembly. The MAX3280E/\nMAX3281E/MAX3283E/MAX3284E receiver inputs (A, \nB) have extra protection against static electricity found \nin normal operation. Maxim’s engineers developed \nstate-of-the-art structures to protect these pins against  ±15kV ESD without damage. After an ESD event, this \nfamily of parts continues working without latchup.\nESD protection can be tested in several ways. The \nreceiver inputs are characterized for protection to the \nfollowing:\n ●±15kV using the Human Body Model\n ●±6kV using the Contact Discharge method specified \nin IEC 1000-4-2 (formerly IEC 801-2)\n ●±12kV using the Air-Gap Discharge method specified \nin IEC 1000-4-2 (formerly IEC 801-2)\nESD Test Conditions\nESD performance depends on a number of conditions. \nContact Maxim for a reliability report that documents test \nsetup, methodology, and results.\nHuman Body Model\nFigure 3a shows the Human Body Model, and Figure \n3b shows the current waveform it generates when dis -\ncharged into a low impedance. This model consists of a \n100pF capacitor charged to the ESD voltage of interest, \nwhich is then discharged into the device through a 1.5k W \nresistor.\nIEC 1000-4-2\nSince January 1996, all equipment manufactured \nand/or sold in the European community has been \nrequired to meet the stringent IEC 1000-4-2 specifica-  \ntion.

Because series resistance is lower in \nthe IEC 1000-4-2 ESD test model (Figure 4a), the ESD-\nwithstand voltage measured to this standard is generally \nlower than that measured using the Human Body Model. \nFigure 4b shows the current waveform for the ±8kV IEC \n1000-4-2 Level 4 ESD Contact Discharge test. The Air-\nGap test involves approaching the device with a charger \nprobe. The Contact Discharge method connects the \nprobe to the device before the probe is energized.\nMachine Model\nThe Machine Model for ESD testing uses a 200pF stor -\nage capacitor and zero-discharge resistance. It mimics \nthe stress caused by handling during manufacturing and \nassembly. All pins (not just the RS-485 inputs) require this \nprotection during manufacturing. Therefore, the Machine \nModel is less relevant to the I/O ports than are the Human \nBody Model and IEC 1000-4-2.\nTrue Fail-Safe\nThe MAX3280E/MAX3281E/MAX3283E/MAX3284E guar -\nantee a logic-high receiver output when the receiver inputs \nare shorted or open, or when they are connected to a \nterminated transmission line with all drivers disabled. This \nguaranteed logic high is achieved by setting the receiver \nthreshold between -50mV and -200mV. If the differential \nreceiver input voltage (V A - VB) is greater than or equal to \n-50mV, RO is logic high. If (V A - VB) is less than or equal \nto -200mV, RO is logic low.\nIn the case of a terminated bus with all transmitters dis -\nabled, the receiver’s differential input voltage is pulled to \nground by the termination. This results in a logic high with \na 50mV minimum noise margin. Unlike previous fail-safe \ndevices, the -50mV to -200mV threshold complies with \nthe ±200mV EIA/TIA-485 standard.\nReceiver Enable  \n(MAX3281E and MAX3283E only)\nThe MAX3281E and MAX3283E feature a receiver out -\nput enable (EN, MAX3281E or EN, MAX3283E) input \nthat controls the receiver. The MAX3281E receiver \nenable (EN) pin is active high, meaning the receiver \noutputs are active when EN is high. The MAX3283E \nreceiver enable ( EN) pin is active low. Receiver outputs \nare high impedance when the MAX3281E’s EN pin is low \nand when the MAX3283E’s EN pin is high.Low-Voltage Logic Levels  \n(MAX3284E only)\nAn increasing number of applications now operate at \nlow-voltage logic levels. To enable compatibility with \nthese low-voltage logic level applications, such as digital \nFPGAs, the MAX3284E V L pin is a user-defined supply \nvoltage that designates the voltage threshold for a logic \nhigh.\nAt lower V L voltages, the data rate will also be lower. \nA logic-high level of 1.65V will receive data at 20Mbps. \nTable 2 gives data rates at various voltages at V L.\nApplications Information\nPropagation Delay Matching\nThe MAX3280E/MAX3281E/MAX3283E/MAX3284E (V CC \n= VL) exhibit propagation delays that are closely matched \nfrom one device to another, even between devices from \ndifferent production lots. This feature allows multiple data \nlines to receive data and clock signals with minimal skew \nwith respect to each other. Figure 5 shows the typical \npropagation delays. Small receiver skew times, the differ -\nence between the low-to-high and high-to-low propagation \ndelay, help maintain a symmetrical ratio (50% duty cycle). \nThe receiver skew time | t PLH - tPHL | is under 2ns for \neither a 3.3V supply or a 5V supply.\nMultidrop Clock Distribution\nLow package-to-package skew (8ns max) makes the \nMAX3280E/MAX3281E/MAX3283E/MAX3284E  \n(VCC = V L) ideal for multidrop clock distribution. When \ndistributing a clock signal to multiple circuits over long \ntransmission lines, receivers in separate locations, and \npossibly at two different temperatures, would ideallyTable 1.

The \nskew must be kept well below the period of the clock \nsignal to ensure that all of the circuits on the network  \nare synchronized.\n128 Receivers on the Bus\nThe standard RS-485 input impedance is 12k W (one-\nunit load). The standard RS-485 transmitter can drive \n32 unit loads. The MAX3280E/MAX3281E/MAX3283E/  \nMAX3284E present a 1/4-unit-load input impedance (48k W), which allows up to 128 receivers on the bus. \nAny combination of these RS-485 receivers with a total \nof 32 unit loads can be connected to the same bus.\nThermal Protection \nThe MAX3280E/MAX3281E/MAX3283E/MAX3284E fea -\nture thermal protection.
