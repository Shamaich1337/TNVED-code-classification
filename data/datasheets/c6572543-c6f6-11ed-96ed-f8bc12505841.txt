The ideal power -up sequence is as \nfollows:  \n1. Connect the ground reference.  \n2. Power up VDD and VSS. The relative order is not \nimportant.  \n3. Apply  the digital control inputs. The relative order of the \ndigital control inputs is not important.  \n4. Apply an RF input signal to RF1 or RF2 .  \nThe power -down sequence is the reverse of the power -up \nsequence. \nRF INPUT AND OUTPUT \nThe HMC939ALP4E  is bidirectional . The RF1 and RF2  pins are \ninternally matched to 50 Ω  and dc-couple d to 0 V; therefore, \nthey do not require external matching components and dc  \nblocking capacit ors when the RF line potential is equal to 0  V. \n \n \nHMC939ALP4E  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 10 of 11 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nEVALUATION BOARD  \nThe HMC939ALP4E  uses a 4 -layer evaluation board. The \ncopper thickness is 0.5 oz (0.7 mil) on each layer. The top \ndielectric material is 10 mil Rogers RO435 0 for optimal high \nfrequency performance. T he middle and bottom dielectric  \nmaterials are FR -4 type materials to achieve an overall b oard \nthickness of 62 mil. RF traces are routed on the top copper layer \nand the bottom layer is grounded plane that provide a solid ground for the RF transmission lines. The RF transmission lines \nare designed using a coplanar waveguide (CPWG) model with a \nwidth of 16  mil and ground spacing of 13 mil to have a \ncharacteristic impedance of 50 Ω. For enhanced RF and  thermal \ngrounding, as many plated through vias as possible are arranged \naround transmission lines and under the exposed pad of the \npackage.  \nFigure 21 shows the top view of the populated HMC939ALP4E  \nevaluation board, available from Analog Devices, Inc., upon \nrequest (see the Ordering Guide  section ). \n \nFigure 21. Populated Evaluation Board —Top View  \n The evaluation board is grounded from the 2 × 5 -pin header, J3 . \nAll the supply and  digital control pins are also connect ed to the  \nJ3. A 1 nF  decoupling capacitor s are placed  on the supply trace s \nto filter high frequency noise.  \nThe RF 1 and RF2  ports  are connected through 5 0 Ω transmission \nlines to the RF  connect ors, J1 and J2, respective ly. A thru \ncalibration line con nects J4 and J 5; this  transmission line is used \nto estimate the loss of the PCB over the environmental conditions  \nbeing evaluated.  \nFigure 22 and Table 6 show the evaluation board schematic and \nbill of materials, respectively.  \n \nFigure 22.
