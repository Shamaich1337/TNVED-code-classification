Product characteristics must be evaluated on a board mounted .\n2. When transitory load is used in which short -time load is applied such as pulse, a resistor should \nbe tested on a board mounted. If load is higher than rated voltage under the load conditions at \ncontinuous steps, it causes damages on characteristics or reliability of the resistor. Therefore, \nwhen load exceed the rated voltage, it is not allowed to apply .\n3. It is not recommended to use halogen products such as chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), etc. or \nfluxes that are highly active due to the residue that is able to affect the characteristics or \nreliability of a resistor .\n4.
