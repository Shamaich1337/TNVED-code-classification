Address and data are transferred serially through an I\n2C, bidirectional bus. \nThe clock/calendar provides seconds, minutes, hours, \nday, date, month, and year information. The end of \nthe month date is automatically adjusted for months \nwith fewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap year. The clock operates in either the 24- hour or 1 2-\nhour format with AM/PM indicator. The DS1307 has a \nbuilt-in power -sense circuit that detects power failures \nand automatically switches to the backup supply. \nTimekeeping operation continues while the part \noperates from the backup supply.  \n \nTYPICAL OPERATING CIRCUIT  \n \n BENEFITS AND FEATURES  \n\uf0a7 Completely Manages All Timekeeping Functions  \no Real-Time Clock Counts Seconds, Minutes,  \nHours, Date of the Month, Month, Day of the  \nWeek, and Year with Leap- Year  \nCompensation Valid Up to 2100  \no 56-Byte, Battery -Backed, General -Purpose \nRAM with Unlimited Writes  \no Programmable Square- Wave Output Signal  \n\uf0a7 Simple Serial Port Interfaces to Most \nMicrocontrollers  \no I2C Serial Interface \n\uf0a7 Low Power Operation Extends Battery Backup Run Time  \no Consumes Less than 500nA in Battery -\nBackup Mode with Oscillator Running  \no Automatic Power -Fail Detect and Switch \nCircuitry  \n\uf0a7 8-Pin DIP and 8- Pin SO Minimizes Required \nSpace  \n\uf0a7 Optional Industrial Temperature Range: - 40°C to \n+85°C Supports Operation in a Wide Range of \nApplications  \n\uf0a7 Underwr iters Laboratories ® (UL) Recognized  \n \nPIN CONFIGURATIONS  \nVCC\nSCL\nSDAX1\nX2\nVBAT\nGNDSQW/OUTVCC\nSCL\nSDAX1\nX2\nVBAT\nGNDSQW/OUT\nPDIP (300 mils) SO (150 mils)TOP VLEW\nORDERING INFORMATION  \nPART  TEMP RANGE  VOLTAGE (V)  PIN-PACKAGE  TOP MARK*  \nDS1307+  0°C to +70°C  5.0 8 PDIP (300 mils)  DS1307  \nDS1307N+  -40°C to +85°C  5.0 8 PDIP (300 mils)  DS1307N  \nDS1307Z+  0°C to +70°C  5.0 8 SO (150 mils)  DS1307  \nDS1307ZN+  -40°C to +85°C  5.0 8 SO (150 mils)  DS1307N  \nDS1307Z+T&R  0°C to +70°C  5.0 8 SO (150 mils) Tape and Reel  DS1307  \nDS1307ZN+T&R  -40°C to +85°C  5.0 8 SO (150 mils) Tape and Reel  DS1307N  \n+Denotes a lead- free/RoHS -compliant package.  \n*A “+” anywhere on the top mark indicates a lead- free package.

Battery \nvoltage must be held between the minimum and maximum limits for proper operation. \nDiodes in series between the battery and the V BAT pin may prevent proper operation. If a \nbackup supply is not requir ed, V BAT must be grounded. The nominal power -fail trip point \n(VPF) voltage at which access to the RTC and user RAM is denied is set by the internal \ncircuitry as 1.25 x V BAT nominal. A lithium battery with 48mAh or greater will back up the \nDS1307 for more t han 10 years in the absence of power at +25°C.  \nUL recognized to ensure against reverse charging current when used with a lithium battery. Go to: www.maxim -ic.com/qa/info/ul/\n. \n4 GND Ground  \n5 SDA Serial Data Input/Output. SDA is the data input/output for the I2C serial interface. The \nSDA pin is open drain and requires an external pullup resistor. The pullup voltage can be \nup to 5.5V regardless of the voltage on V CC. \n6 SCL Serial Clock Input. SCL is the c lock input for the I2C interface and is used to synchronize \ndata movement on the serial interface. The pullup voltage can be up to 5.5V regardless of \nthe voltage on V CC. \n7 SQW/OUT  Square Wave/Output Driver. When enabled, the SQWE bit set to 1, the SQW/OUT  pin \noutputs one of four square- wave frequencies (1Hz, 4kHz, 8kHz, 32kHz). The SQW/OUT \npin is open drain and requires an external pullup resistor. SQW/OUT operates with either \nVCC or V BAT applied. The pullup voltage can be up to 5.5V regardless of the volt age on \nVCC. If not used, this pin can be left floating.  \n8 VCC Primary Power Supply. When voltage is applied within normal limits, the device is fully \naccessible and data can be written and read. When a backup supply is connected to the \ndevice and V CC is below V TP, read and writes are inhibited. However, the timekeeping \nfunction continues unaffected by the lower input voltage.  \n \n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION  \nThe DS1307 is a low -power clock/calendar with 56 bytes of battery -backed SRAM. The clock/calendar provides \nseconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and year information. The date at the end of the month is automatically \nadjusted for months with fewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap year. The DS1307 operates as a slave device on the I\n2C bus. Access is obtained by implementing a START condition and providing a device identification \ncode followed by a register address. Subsequent registers can be accessed sequentially until a STOP condition is executed. When V\nCC falls below 1.25 x V BAT, the device ter minates an access in progress and resets the device \naddress counter. Inputs to the device will not be recognized at this time to prevent erroneous data from being written to the device from an out -of-tolerance system. When V\nCC falls below V BAT, the device switches into a low -\ncurrent battery -backup mode. Upon power -up, the device switches from battery to V CC when V CC is greater than \nVBAT +0.2V and recognizes inputs when V CC is greater than 1.25 x V BAT. The block diagram in Figure 1 shows the \nmain elements of the serial RTC.  \n \n  \n6 of 14 \nDS1307 64 x 8, Serial, I2C Real -Time Clock  \n \nOSCILLATOR CIRCUIT  \nThe DS1307 uses an external 32.768kHz crystal. The oscillator circuit does not require any external resistors or \ncapacitors to operate. Table 1 specifies several crystal paramet ers for the external crystal. Figure 1 shows a \nfunctional schematic of the oscillator circuit. If using a crystal with the specified characteristics, the startup time is \nusually less than one second.  \n \nCLOCK ACCURAC Y \nThe accuracy of the clock is dependent upon the accuracy of the crystal and the accuracy of the match between \nthe capacitive load of the oscillator circuit and the capacitive load for which the crystal was trimmed.  Additional \nerror will be added by cryst al frequency drift caused by temperature shifts. External circuit noise coupled into the \noscillator circuit may result in the clock running fast.

The RTC registers are located in address \nlocations 00h to 07h. The RAM registers are located in address locations 08h to 3Fh. During a multibyte access, \nwhen the address pointer reaches 3Fh, the end of RAM space, it wraps around to location 00h, the beginning of \nthe clock space.  \n NOTE: AVOID ROUTING SIGNAL LINES IN THE CROSSHATCHED AREA (UPPER \nLEFT QUADRANT) OF THE PACKAGE UNLESS THERE IS A GROUND PLANE \nBETWEEN THE SIGNAL LINE AND THE DEVICE PACKAGE.  LOCAL GROUND PLAN E (LAYER 2)  \nCRYSTAL  X1 \nX2 \nGND \n  \n7 of 14 \nDS1307 64 x 8, Serial, I2C Real -Time Clock  \n \nCLOCK AND CALENDAR  \nThe time and calendar information is obtained by reading the appropriate register bytes. Table 2 shows the RTC \nregisters. The time and calendar are set or initialized by writing the appropriate register bytes. The contents of the \ntime and calendar registers are in the BCD format. The day -of-week register increments at midnight. Values that \ncorrespond to the day of w eek are user -defined but must be sequential (i.e., if 1 equals Sunday, then 2 equals \nMonday, and so on.) Illogical time and date entries result in undefined operation. Bit 7 of Register 0 is the clock halt \n(CH) bit. When this bit is set to 1, the oscillator is disabled. When cleared to 0, the oscillator is enabled. On first \napplication of power to the device the time and date registers are typically reset to 01/01/00 01 00:00:00 \n(MM/DD/YY DOW HH:MM:SS). The CH bit in the seconds register will be set to a 1.  The clock can be halted \nwhenever the timekeeping functions are not required, which minimizes current (I BATDR ). \n \nThe DS1307 can be run in either 12- hour or 24- hour mode. Bit 6 of the hours register is defined as the 12- hour or \n24-hour mode- select bit. When high, the 12- hour mode is selected. In the 12- hour mode, bit 5 is the AM/PM bit with \nlogic high being PM. In the 24- hour mode, bit 5 is the second 10- hour bit (20 to 23 hours). The hours value must be \nre-entered whenever the 12/24- hour mode bit is changed.  \n \nWhen reading or writing the time and date registers, secondary (user) buffers are used to prevent errors when the \ninternal registers update. When reading the time and date registers, the user buffers are synchronized to the \ninternal registers on any I2C START. The time information is read from these secondary registers while the clock \ncontinues to run. This eliminates the need to re- read the registers in case the internal registers update during a \nread. The divider chain is reset whenever the seconds reg ister is written. Write transfers occur on the I2C \nacknowledge from the DS1307. Once the divider chain is reset, to avoid rollover issues, the remaining time and \ndate registers must be written within one second.  \n \nTable 2.

This bit controls the output level of the SQW/OUT pin when the square- wave output \nis disabled. If SQWE = 0, the logic level on the SQW/OUT pin is 1 if OUT = 1 and is 0 if OUT = 0. On initial \napplication of power to the device, this bit is typically set to a 0.  \n Bit 4: Square -Wave Enable (SQWE).  This bit, when set to logic 1, enables the oscillator output. The frequency of \nthe square- wave output depends upon the value of the RS0 and RS1 bits. With the square- wave output set to 1Hz, \nthe clock registers update on the falling edge of the square wave. On initial application of power to the device, this bit is typically set to a 0.  \n \nBits 1 and 0: Rate Select (RS[1:0]).  These bits control the frequency of the square- wave output when the square-\nwave output has been enabled.

A device that sends data onto the bus is defined as a transmitter and a \ndevice receiving data as a receiver. The device that controls the message is called a master. The devices that are \ncontrolled by the master are referred to as slaves. The bus m ust be controlled by a master device that generates \nthe serial clock (SCL), controls the bus access, and generates the START and STOP conditions. The DS1307 \noperates as a slave on the I2C bus.  \n \nFigures 3, 4, and 5 detail how data is transferred on the I2C bus. \n \uf0a7 Data transfer can be initiated only when the bus is not busy.  \n\uf0a7 During data transfer, the data line must remain stable whenever the clock line is HIGH. Changes in the data line while the clock line is high will be interpreted as control signals.  \n \nAccor dingly, the following bus conditions have been defined:  \n \nBus not busy: Both data and clock lines remain HIGH.  \n \nSTART data transfer: A change in the state of the data line, from HIGH to LOW, while the clock is HIGH, \ndefines a START condition.  \n \nSTOP data tra nsfer: A change in the state of the data line, from LOW to HIGH, while the clock line is HIGH, \ndefines the STOP condition.  \n \nData valid: The state of the data line represents valid data when, after a START condition, the data line is \nstable for the duration of the HIGH period of the clock signal. The data on the line must be changed during the \nLOW period of the clock signal. There is one clock pulse per bit of data.  \nEach data transfer is initiated with a START condition and terminated with a STOP condition. The number of \ndata bytes transferred between START and STOP conditions is not limited, and is determined by the master \ndevice. The information is transferred byte- wise and each receiver acknowledges with a ninth bit. Within the \nI\n2C bus specifications a sta ndard mode (100kHz clock rate) and a fast mode (400kHz clock rate) are defined. \nThe DS1307 operates in the standard mode (100kHz) only.  \n \nAcknowledge: Each receiving device, when addressed, is obliged to generate an acknowledge after the \nreception of each b yte. The master device must generate an extra clock pulse which is associated with this \nacknowledge bit.  \nA device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse in such a way \nthat the SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH  period of the acknowledge related clock pulse. Of course, \nsetup and hold times must be taken into account. A master must signal an end of data to the slave by not generating an acknowledge bit on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In th is case, the slave \nmust leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate the STOP condition.  \n \n  \n10 of 14 \nDS1307 64 x 8, Serial, I2C Real -Time Clock  \n \nFigure 3. Data Transfer on I2C Serial Bus  \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nDepending upon the state of the R/ W bit, two types of data transfer are possible:  \n \n1. Data transfer from a master transmitter to a slave receiver. The first byte transmitted by the master is the \nslave address. Next follows a number of data bytes. The slave returns an acknowledge bit after each received byte. Data is transferred with the most significant bit (MSB) first.  \n2. Data transfer from a slave transmitter to a master receiver. The first byte (the slave address) is transmitted \nby the master. The slave then returns an acknowledge bit. This is followed by the slave transmitt ing a number \nof data bytes. The master returns an acknowledge bit after all received bytes other than the last byte. At the \nend of the last received byte, a “not acknowledge” is returned.  \nThe master device generates all the serial clock pulses and the STAR T and STOP conditions. A transfer is \nended with a STOP condition or with a repeated START condition. Since a repeated START condition is also the beginning of the next serial transfer, the bus will not be released. Data is transferred with the most \nsignificant bit (MSB) first.  \n ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  \nSIGNAL FROM RECEIVER  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT  \nSIGNAL FROM RECEIVER  R/ W \nDIRECTION  \nBIT \nREPEATED IF MORE BYTES  \nARE TRANSFERED  START  \nCONDITION  STOP \nCONDITION  \nOR \nREPEATED  \nSTART  \nCONDITION  MSB \n1 2 6 7 8 9 1 2 3-7 8 9 \nACK ACK SDA \nSCL \n  \n11 of 14 \nDS1307 64 x 8, Serial, I2C Real -Time Clock  \n \n...

Slave Receiver Mode (Write Mode): Serial data and clock are received through SDA and SCL. After \neach byte is received an acknowledge bit is transmitted. START and STOP conditions ar e recognized \nas the beginning and end of a serial transfer. Hardware performs address recognition after reception of \nthe slave address and direction bit (see Figure 4). The slave address byte is the first byte received \nafter the master generates the START condition. The slave address byte contains the 7- bit DS1307 \naddress, which is 1101000, followed by the direction bit (R/ W), which for a write is 0. After receiving and \ndecoding the slave address byte, the DS1307 ou tputs an acknowledge on SDA. After the DS1307 \nacknowledges the slave address + write bit, the master transmits a word address to the DS1307. This sets the register pointer on the DS1307, with the DS1307 acknowledging the transfer. The master can \nthen trans mit zero or more bytes of data with the DS1307 acknowledging each byte received. The \nregister pointer automatically increments after each data byte are written. The master will generate a \nSTOP condition to terminate the data write.  \n2. Slave Transmitter Mode ( Read Mode): The first byte is received and handled as in the slave receiver \nmode. However, in this mode, the direction bit will indicate that the transfer direction is reversed. The \nDS1307 transmits serial data on SDA while the serial clock is input on SCL. START and STOP \nconditions are recognized as the beginning and end of a serial transfer (see Figure 5). The slave \naddress byte is the first byte received after the START condition is generated by the master. The s lave \naddress byte contains the 7- bit DS1307 address, which is 1101000, followed by the direction bit (R/ W), \nwhich is 1 for a read. After receiving and decoding the slave address the DS1307 outputs an acknowledge on SDA. The DS1307 then begins to transmit data starting with the register address \npointed to by the register pointer. If the register pointer is not written to before the initiation of a read \nmode the first address that is read is the last one stored in the register pointer. The register pointer \nautomatically increments after each byte are read. The DS1307 must receive a Not Acknowledge to \nend a read.  \nFigure 4.
