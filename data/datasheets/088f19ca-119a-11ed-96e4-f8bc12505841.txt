The A port is\ndesigned to track V CCA. VCCA accepts any supply\nvoltage from 0.9 V to 3.6 V. The B port is designed\nto track V CCB. V CCB accepts any supply voltage\nfrom 0.9 V to 3.6 V. This allows for low-voltage\ntranslation between 0.9-V, 1.2-V, 1.5-V, 1.8-V, 2.5-V\nand 3.6-V voltage nodes. For the SN74AVC2T244,\nwhen the output-enable ( OE) input is high, all\noutputs are placed in the high-impedance state. The\nSN74AVC2T244 is designed so that the OE input\ncircuit is referenced to V CCA. This device is fully\nspecified for partial-power-down applications using\nIoff. The I off circuitry disables the outputs, preventing\ndamaging current backflow through the device when it\nis powered down.\nVCCB\nB1\nB2\nOEVCCA\nA1\nA2\nGND1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5\nDQE and DQM Packages 8 Pin X2SON (Top View)www.ti.comSN74AVC2T244\nSCES767C – SEPTEMBER 2011 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: SN74AVC2T244SN74AVC2T244\nSCES767C – SEPTEMBER 2011 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

#### Description:
The SN74AVC2T244 is a 2-bit unidirectional voltage-level translator designed to facilitate low-voltage translation between various voltage nodes ranging from 0.9 V to 3.6 V. It features two separate configurable power-supply rails, allowing the A port to track V_CCA and the B port to track V_CCB. This device is particularly useful for interfacing between different logic levels in digital circuits.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Mobile Devices:** Used in handsets, smartphones, and tablets for voltage level translation between different components operating at various voltage levels.
- **Servers:** Facilitates communication between components with differing voltage requirements.
- **General Digital Logic Applications:** Ideal for applications requiring signal level shifting, such as interfacing microcontrollers with sensors or other peripherals that operate at different voltage levels.

This component is particularly beneficial in systems where power efficiency is critical, as it allows for low-power operation while maintaining high-speed data rates up to 380 Mbps, depending on the voltage translation scenario.
