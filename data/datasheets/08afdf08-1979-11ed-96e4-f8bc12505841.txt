The device is\nfunctionally equivalent to the EL16 device, operating from a 3.3 V\nsupply. The LVEL16 exhibits a wider V IHCMR  range than its EL16\ncounterpart. With output transition times and propagation delayscomparable to the EL16 the LVEL16 is ideally suited for interfacingwith high frequency sources at 3.3 V supplies.\nUnder open input conditions, the Q input will be pulled down to V\nEE\nand the Q  input will be biased to V CC/2. This condition will force the\nQ output low.\nThe V BB pin, an internally generated voltage supply, is available to\nthis device only. For single-ended input conditions, the unuseddifferential input is connected to V\nBB as a switching reference voltage.\nVBB may also rebias AC coupled inputs. When used, decouple V BB\nand V CC via a 0.01 /C0109 F capacitor and limit current sourcing or sinking\nto 0.5 mA. When not used, V BB should be left open.\nFeatures\n•300 ps Propagation Delay\n•High Bandwidth Output Transitions\n•The 100 Series Contains Temperature Compensation\n•PECL Mode Operating Range: V CC = 3.0 V to 3.8 V\nwith V EE = 0 V\n•NECL Mode Operating Range: V CC = 0 V\nwith V EE = −3.0 V to −3.8 V\n•Internal Input Pulldown Resistors on D, Pullup and Pulldown\nResistors on D\n•Q Output will Default LOW with Inputs Open or at V EE\n•These Devices are Pb−Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free and are RoHS\nCompliant\n*For additional marking information, refer to\nApplication Note AND8002/D.MARKING\nDIAGRAMS*\nKV16\nALYW /C0071\n/C0071SOIC−8\nD SUFFIX\nCASE 75118\nTSSOP−8\nDT SUFFIX\nCASE 948R18\n18\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information in the package\ndimensions section on page 6 of this data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATIONwww. onsemi.com\nKVL16\nALYW\n/C0071\n18\nDFN8\nMN SUFFIX\nCASE 506AA\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)A = Assembly Location\nL = Wafer Lot\nY = YearW = Work WeekM = Date Code\n/C0071= Pb−Free Package4BM/C0071\n/C00711\nMC100LVEL16\nwww. onsemi.com\n2Figure 1.

### Component Summary: MC100LVEL16DG

**Description:**
The MC100LVEL16 is a 3.3V ECL (Emitter Coupled Logic) differential receiver. It is functionally equivalent to the EL16 device but operates at a lower voltage, making it suitable for interfacing with high-frequency sources. The device features a wider input high common mode range (V_IHCMR) compared to its EL16 counterpart, and it includes internal pull-down resistors for open input conditions.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - PECL Mode: V_CC = 3.0 V to 3.8 V, V_EE = 0 V
  - NECL Mode: V_CC = 0 V, V_EE = -3.0 V to -3.8 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Current (I_out): 50 mA (continuous), 100 mA (surge)
  - V_BB Sink/Source: ±0.5 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Power Supply Current (I_EE): 17 mA (min), 23 mA (typ), 24 mA (max) at 25°C

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40°C to +85°C

- **Package Type:**
  - Available in SOIC-8, TSSOP-8, and DFN8 packages

- **Special Features:**
  - 300 ps propagation delay
  - High bandwidth output transitions
  - Internal input pull-down resistors
  - Default LOW output when inputs are open or at V_EE
  - Pb-Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free, and RoHS compliant

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (JEDEC J-STD-020E):**
  - SOIC-8: Level 1
  - TSSOP-8: Level 3
  - DFN8: Level 1

### Typical Applications:
The MC100LVEL16 is primarily used in high-speed data communication applications, including:

- **Data Transmission:** It is suitable for interfacing with high-frequency sources in telecommunications and networking equipment.
- **Signal Processing:** The device can be utilized in signal conditioning circuits where differential signaling is required.
- **Clock Distribution:** It can be employed in clock distribution networks due to its low propagation delay and high-speed capabilities.
- **High-Speed Logic Circuits:** The MC100LVEL16 is ideal for use in ECL logic circuits where low voltage operation is necessary.

This component is particularly valuable in systems requiring reliable and fast data transfer, making it a critical part of modern electronic communication systems.
