The device is intended to drive two power MOSFETs, in the classical half bridge topology. A dedicated timing section allows the designer to set soft-start time, soft-start and minimum frequency. An error amplifier, together with the two enable inputs, are made available. In addition, the integrated bootstrap diode and the Zener clamping on low voltage supply, reduces to a minimum the external parts needed in the applications.  ',3\x14\x19 62\x14\x191\nFigure 1.

A high sink/source driving current (450/250  mA typ.) ensure fast switching times also \nwhen size for power MOS are used. The internal logic ensures a minimum deadtime to avoid cross conduction of the power devices. \n5.2 Timing and oscillator section \nThe device is provided of a soft-start fu nction. It consists in a period of time, TSS, in which \nthe switching frequency shifts fr om fstart to fmin. This feature is explained in the following \ndescription (refer to Figure 6  and Figure 7 ). \nFigure 6. Soft-start and frequency shifting block \nDuring the soft-start time the current ISS charges the capacitor CSS, generating a voltage \nramp which is delivered to a transconductance amplifier, as shown in Figure 6 . Thus this \nvoltage signal is converted in a growing curren t which is subtracted to Ifstart. Therefore the \ncurrent which drives the oscilla tor to set the frequency during  the soft-start is equal to: \nEquation 1\nEquation 2&VV,IPLQ ,IVWDUW ,VV\nJP 26&,RVF\n$0\x13\x15\x15\x1b\x1cY\x14\nIoscIfminIfstartgmVCsst\uf028\uf029 –\uf028\uf029+ IfminIfstartgmIss\nCss--------------–\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0e6\uf0f6+ ==\nwhere IfminVREF\nRfmin------------- -IfstartVREF\nRfstart---------------- VREF2V= , =\uf02c =\nBlock diagram description L6598\n10/23 DocID6554 Rev 8At the startup (t = 0) the os cillator frequency is set by: \nEquation 3\nAt the end of the soft-start (t = TSS) the second term of eq.1 decreases to zero and the \nswitching frequency is se t only by Imin (i.e. Rfmin): \nEquation 4\nSince the second term of Equation 1  is equal to zero, we have: \nEquation 5\nNote that there is not a fixed threshold of the voltage across CSS in which the soft-start \nfinishes (i.e. the end of the frequency shifting), and T SS depends on CSS, Ifstart, gm, and ISS \n(Equation 5 ). Making TSS independent of I fstart, the I SS current has been designed to be \na fraction of Ifstart, so:\nEquation 6\nIn this way the soft-start time depends only on the capacitor CSS. The typical value of the kSS \nconstant (Soft-start timing constant) is 0.15 s/ \uf06dF. \nThe current Iosc is fed to the oscillator as shown in Figure 7 . It is twice mirrored (x4 and x8) \ngenerating the triangu lar wave on the o scillator capacitor Cf. Referring to the internal \nstructure of th e oscillator ( Figure 7 ), a good relationship to compute an approximate value of \nthe oscillator frequency in  normal operation is:\nEquation 7IOSC0\uf028\uf029 IfminIfstart+ VREF1\nRfmin------------- -1\nRfstart----------------+\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0e6\uf0f6= =\nIOSCTSS\uf028\uf029 IfminVREF\nRfmin------------- - = =\nIfstartgmIss\nCss-------------- TSS– 0TSSCssIfstart\ngmIss----------------------- - =\uf0ae =\nISSIfstart\nK------------- -TSSCssIfstart\ngmIfstartK------------------------- -TSS\uf0ae =\uf0aeCss\ngmK----------- TSSkSSCSS–\uf0ae ==\nfmin1.41\nRfminCf--------------------=\nDocID6554 Rev 8 11/23L6598 Block diagram description\n23The degree of approximation depends on the frequency value, but it remains very good in \nthe range from 30 kHz to 100 kHz ( Figure 8  to Figure 12 ).\nFigure 7.

This \nsolution normally requires a high voltage fast recovery diode for charging the bootstrap capacitor ( Figure 13  - part a). In the device a patented  integrated structure replaces this \nexternal diode. It is released by means of a high voltage DMOS, driven synchronously with \nthe low side driver (LVG), with in series a diode, as shown in Figure 13  - part b .\nFigure 13. Bootstrap driver\nTo drive the synchronized DMOS it is necess ary a voltage higher than the supply voltage \nVs. This voltage is obtained by means of an internal charge pump ( Figure 13  - part b).\nThe diode connected in series to the DMOS has been added to avoid undesirable turn on of \nit. The introduction of the diode prevents any current can flow from the Vboot pin to the VS one in case that the supply is quickly turned of f when the internal capacitor of the pump is \nnot fully discharged. \nThe bootstrap driver introduces a voltage drop during the recharging of the capacitor Cboot \n(i.e. when the low side driver is on), which increases with the frequency and with the size of \nthe external power MOS. It is the sum of the drop across the R\nDSON  and of the diode Figure 12. Typ. (fstart-fmin) vs. Rfstar at Cf = 470 pF\n         \n\nBlock diagram description L6598\n14/23 DocID6554 Rev 8threshold voltage. At low frequency this drop is very small and can be neglected. Anyway \nincreasing the frequency it must be taken in  to account. In fact  the drop, reducing the \namplitude of the driving signal, can significantly increase the RDSON  of the external power \nMOS (and so the dissipation).\nTo be considered that in resonant power supplies the current which flows in the power MOS \ndecreases increasing the switching frequency and generally the increases of RDSON  is not \na problem because power dissipation is negligible. Equation 8  is useful to compute the drop \non the bootstrap driver:\nEquation 8\nwhere Q g is the gate charge of the external power MOS, R dson is the on-resistance of the \nbootstrap DMOS, and T charge is the time in which the bootstrap driver remains on (about the \nsemi-period of the switching frequency minus the deadtime). The typical resistance value of \nthe bootstrap DMOS is 150 \uf057. For example using a power MOS with a total gate charge of \n30 nC the drop on the bootstrap driver is about 3 V, at a switching frequency of 200 kHz. In \nfact:\nEquation 9\nTo summaries, if a significant drop on the boo tstrap driver (at high switching frequency when \nlarge power MOS are used) represents a problem, an external diode can be used, avoiding the drop on the R\nDSON  of the DMOS.\n5.4 Op amp section\nThe integrated op amp is designed to offer low output impedance, wide band, high input impedance and wide common mode range. It can be readily used to implement protection features or a closed loop control. For this purpose the op amp output can be properly connected to R\nfmin pin to adjust the oscillation frequency.VdropIch eargRdsonVdiodeVdrop\uf0ae +Qg\nTch earg------------------- RdsonVdiode+ ==\nVdrop30nC\n2.23\uf06ds------------------ 150\uf0570.6V 2.6V\uf07e + =\nDocID6554 Rev 8 15/23L6598 Block diagram description\n235.5 Comparators\nTwo CMOS comparators are available to perform protection schemes. \nShort pulses ( \uf0b3 200 ns) on comparators input are recognized.

Normal \noperating conditions are resumed after a power-off power-on sequence. The EN2 input (active high), with a threshold of 1.2 V (typical  value) restarts a soft-start sequence (see \ntiming diagrams in Figure 3 , Figure 4 , and Figure 5 ). In addition the EN2 comparator, when \nactivated, removes a latched shutdown caused by EN1.\nFigure 14. Switching time waveform definitions\nFigure 15.

**Description:**
The L6598 is a high voltage resonant controller designed for driving power MOSFETs in half-bridge topologies, particularly suitable for AC/DC adapters and resonant power supply applications. It utilizes BCD™ offline technology, allowing it to handle high voltage operations up to 600 V. The device features a dedicated timing section for soft-start and frequency control, an integrated bootstrap diode, and an error amplifier for closed-loop control.

**Typical Applications:**
The L6598 is primarily used in:
- AC/DC power adapters
- Resonant power supplies
- Applications requiring efficient power management and control
- Systems where high voltage and fast switching capabilities are essential, such as in power electronics and renewable energy systems.

This component is ideal for designers looking to implement high-performance power management solutions with minimal external components due to its integrated features.
