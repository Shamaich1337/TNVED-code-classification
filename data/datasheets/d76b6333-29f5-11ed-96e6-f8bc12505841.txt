The I off circuitry disables the outputs,\npreventing damaging current backflow through the device when it is powered down.\nTo ensure the high-impedance state during power up or power down, OE should be tied to V CC through a\npulldown resistor; the minimum value of the resistor is determined by the current-sourcing capability of the driver.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\n1A 1Y1OE\n2A2OE\n2Y\n8.3 Feature Description\n• 1.65 V to 5.5 V operating voltage range\n• Allows down voltage translation\n– 5 V to 3.3 V\n– 5 V or 3.3 V to 1.8V\n• Inputs accept voltages to 5.5 V\n– 5-V tolerance on input pin\n• I off feature\n– Allows voltage on the inputs and outputs when V CC is 0 V\n– Able to prevent leakage when V CC is 0 V\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nTable 8-1  lists the functional modes of SN74LVC2G126.\nTable 8-1.

TI’s customers are responsible for determining\nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN74LVC2G126 device is a high-drive CMOS device that can be used as an output enabled buffer with a\nhigh output drive, such as an LED application. It can produce 24 mA of drive current at 3.3 V, making it ideal for\ndriving multiple outputs and good for high speed applications up to 100 MHz. The inputs are 5.5-V tolerant\nallowing it to translate down to V CC.\n9.2 Typical Application\nuC or LogicBasic LED Driver\nWired OR\nuC or LogicBuffer Function\nuC or LogicVCC\nuC or LogicVCC\nuC or Logic\nFigure 9-1. Application Schematic\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nThis device uses CMOS technology and has balanced output drive. Take care to avoid bus contention because it\ncan drive currents that would exceed maximum limits. Outputs can be combined to produce higher drive but the\nhigh drive also creates faster edges into light loads so routing and load conditions should be considered to\nprevent ringing.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n1. Recommended Input Conditions:\n• For rise time and fall time specifications, see Δt/ΔV in the Section 6.3  table.\n• For specified high and low levels, see V IH and V IL in the Section 6.3  table.\n• Inputs are overvoltage tolerant allowing them to go as high as 5.5 V at any valid V CC.\n2. Recommended Output Conditions:\n• Load currents should not exceed 50 mA per output and 100 mA total for the part.SN74LVC2G126\nSCES205N – APRIL 1999 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC2G126\n9.2.3 Application Curve\nFrequency (MHz)I (mA)CC\n0 20 40 60 80012345678910\nD003V 1.8 VCC\nVCC2.5 V\nVCC3.3 V\nVCC5 V\nFigure 9-2. I CC vs Frequency\n10 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe power supply can be any voltage between the MIN and MAX supply voltage rating located in the Section 6.3\ntable.\nEach V CC terminal should have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. For devices with a single\nsupply, a 0.1- μF capacitor is recommended. If there are multiple V CC terminals then 0.01- μF or 0.022- μF\ncapacitors are recommended for each power terminal. It is ok to parallel multiple bypass capacitors to reject\ndifferent frequencies of noise. Multiple bypass capacitors may be paralleled to reject different frequencies of\nnoise. Install the bypass capacitor as close to the power terminal as possible for the best results.www.ti.comSN74LVC2G126\nSCES205N – APRIL 1999 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC2G126\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple bit logic devices, inputs should not float. In many cases, functions or parts of functions of\ndigital logic devices are unused. Some examples are when only two inputs of a triple-input AND gate are used,\nor when only 3 of the 4-buffer gates are used. Such input pins should not be left unconnected because the\nundefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states.\nSpecified in Figure 11-1  are rules that must be observed under all circumstances. All unused inputs of digital\nlogic devices must be connected to a high or low bias to prevent them from floating. The logic level that should\nbe applied to any particular unused input depends on the function of the device. Generally they will be tied to\nGND or V CC, whichever makes more sense or is more convenient. It is acceptable to float outputs unless the\npart is a transceiver. If the transceiver has an output enable pin, it will disable the outputs section of the part\nwhen asserted. This does not disable the input section of the I/Os so they also cannot float when disabled.\n11.2 Layout Example\nVcc\nUnused Input\nInputOutputInput\nUnused Input Output\nFigure 11-1.
