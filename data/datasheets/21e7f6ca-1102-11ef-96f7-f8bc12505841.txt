The duration oftime isdependent ontheRand Cvalues (asshown inFigure 17)and can be\ncalculated by:\nt=1.1×R×Cseconds (6)\n8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nToallow theLED toflash onforanoticeable amount oftime, a5second time delay was chosen forthis\napplication. Byusing Equation 6,RCequals 4.545. IfRisselected as100kΩ,C=45.4 µF.The values ofR=\n100kΩandC=47µFwas selected based onstandard values ofresistors andcapacitors. Amomentary push\nbutton switch connected toground isconnected tothetrigger input with a10-K current limiting resistor pullup to\nthesupply voltage.

#### Description:
The LM555 is a highly stable timer IC used for generating precise time delays or oscillations. It can operate in two modes: monostable (one-shot) and astable (oscillator). In monostable mode, the output pulse width is determined by an external resistor and capacitor, while in astable mode, it generates a continuous square wave output with a frequency and duty cycle controlled by two resistors and one capacitor.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Precision Timing:** Used in applications requiring accurate time delays.
- **Pulse Generation:** Generates pulses for various timing applications.
- **Sequential Timing:** Can be used in applications that require timed sequences.
- **Time Delay Generation:** Commonly used in circuits that need to delay an action.
- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM):** Used in motor control and dimming applications.
- **Pulse Position Modulation:** Employed in communication systems.
- **Linear Ramp Generator:** Useful in analog signal processing.

The LM555 timer is versatile and widely used in various electronic circuits, making it a staple component in both hobbyist and professional applications.
