MIC59150\n \n  \nDecember 2008  8 M9999-121808-A \n Application Information \nThe MIC59150 is an ultra-high performance, low-dropout \nlinear regulator designed for high current applications \nrequiring a fast transient response. The MIC59150 \nutilizes two input supplies, si gnificantly reducing dropout \nvoltage, making it perfect for low-voltage, DC-to-DC \nconversion. The MIC59150 requires a minimum number \nof external components, and as a μCap regulator, the \noutput is tolerant of virtua lly any type of capacitor, \nincluding ceramic type and tantalum type capacitors. \nThe MIC59150 regulator is fully protected from damage \ndue to fault conditions, offering linear current limiting and \nthermal shutdown. \nBias Supply Voltage \nVBIAS, requiring relatively light current, provides power to \nthe control portion of the MIC59150. V BIAS  requires \napproximately 12mA for a 1.5A load current. Dropout conditions require higher currents. Most of the biasing \ncurrent is used to supply the base current to the pass \ntransistor. This allows the pass element to be driven into saturation, reducing the dropout to 100mV at a 1.5A load \ncurrent. Bypassing on the bias pin is recommended to \nimprove performance of t he regulator during line and \nload transients. Small ceramic capacitors from VBIAS\n to \nground help reduce high frequency noise from being \ninjected into the control circuitry from the bias rail and are good design practice. Good bypass techniques \ntypically include one larger capacitor such as 1 μF \nceramic and smaller valued capacitors such as 0.01 μF \nor 0.001 μF in parallel with that larger capacitor to \ndecouple the bias supply. The VBIAS\n input voltage must \nbe 2.1V above the output voltage with a minimum VBIAS  \ninput voltage of 3V. \nInput Supply Voltage \nVIN provides the high current to the collector of the pass \ntransistor. The minimum input voltage is 1.0V, allowing \nconversion from low voltage supplies. \nOutput Capacitor \nThe MIC59150 requires a minimum of output \ncapacitance to maintain stability. Howe ver, proper \ncapacitor selection is important to ensure desired transient response. The MIC59150 is specifically \ndesigned to be stable with virtually any capacitance \nvalue and ESR. A 1 μF ceramic chip capacitor should \nsatisfy most applications. Output capacitance can be \nincreased without bound. See the “ Functional \nCharacteristics ” subsection for examples of load \ntransient response. \nX7R dielectric ceramic capacitors are recommended \nbecause of their temperature performance. X7R-type capacitors change capacitance by 15% over their \noperating temperature range and are the most stable type of ceramic capacitors. Z5U and Y5V dielectric \ncapacitors change value by as much as 50% and 60% respectively over their operating temperature ranges. To \nuse a ceramic chip capacitor with Y5V dielectric, the \nvalue must be much higher than an X7R ceramic or a tantalum capacitor to ensure the same capacitance \nvalue over the operating temperature range. Tantalum \ncapacitors have a very stable dielectric (10% over their operating temperature range) and can also be used with \nthis device. \nInput Capacitor \nAn input capacitor of 1 μF or greater is recommended \nwhen the device is more than 4 inches away from the \nbulk supply capacitance, or when the supply is a battery. Small, surface-mount, ceramic chip capacitors can be \nused for the bypassing. The capacitor should be placed \nwithin 1" of the device for optimal performance. Larger values will help to improve ripple rejection by bypassing \nthe input to the regulator, further improving the integrity \nof the output voltage. \nThermal Design \nLinear regulators are simple to use. The most \ncomplicated design parameters to consider are thermal characteristics. Thermal design requires the following \napplication-specific parameters: \n• Maximum ambient temperature (T\nA) \n• Output current (I OUT) \n• Output voltage (V OUT) \n• Input voltage (V IN) \n• Ground current (I GND) \nFirst, calculate the power dissipation (P D) of the \nregulator from these numbers and the device parameters from this datasheet. \n \nOUT OUT BIAS BIAS IN IN D I V I V I V P ×−×+×=  \nThe input current will be less than the output current at \nhigh output currents as the load increases. The bias current is a sum of base drive and ground current. \nGround current is constant over load current. Then the \nheat sink thermal resistance is determined with this formula: \n \n()CS JC\nDA MAXJ\nSAPT T\nθθ θ +−⎟⎟\n⎠⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝⎛−\n=) (\x01\nThe heat sink may be significantly reduced in \napplications where the maximum input voltage is known and large compared with the dropout voltage. Use a \nseries input resistor to drop excessive voltage and \ndistribute the heat between this resistor and the regulator. The low-dropout properties of the MIC59150 \nallow significant reductions in  regulator power dissipation \nand the associated heat sink without compromising \nMicrel, Inc. MIC59150\n \n  \nDecember 2008  9 M9999-121808-A \n performance. When this technique is employed, a \ncapacitor of at least 1 μF is needed directly between the \ninput and regulator ground. Refer to “ Application Note 9 ” \n(http://www.micrel.com/_PDF /App-Notes/an-9.pdf) for \nfurther details and examples on thermal design and heat sink specification. \nMinimum Load Current \nThe MIC59150, unlike most other high current \nregulators, does not require a minimum load to maintain \noutput voltage regulation. \nAdjustable Regulator Design \nThe MIC59150 adjustable version allows programming \nthe output voltage anywhere between 0.5Vand 3.5V. \nTwo resistors are used. The resistor value between V\nOUT \nand the adjust pin should not exceed 10k Ω. Larger values can cause instability.  The resistor values are \ncalculated by: \n ⎟⎟\n⎠⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝⎛\n− ×= 15.02 1OUTV\nR R  \nwhere V OUT is the desired output voltage. \nEnable \nAn active high enable input (EN) allows on-off control of \nthe regulator. Current drain r educes to “zero” when the \ndevice is shutdown, with only microamperes of leakage \ncurrent. The EN input has CMOS compatible thresholds \nfor simple logic interfacing. EN may be directly tied to V\nBIAS  and pulled up to the maximum supply voltage. \n \n \nMicrel, Inc.
