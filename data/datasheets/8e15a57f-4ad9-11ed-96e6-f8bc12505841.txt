AD5242 Functional Block Diagram\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe AD5241/AD52421 provide a single-/dual-channel, 256-position,\ndigitally controlled variable resistor (VR) device. These devices\nperform the same electronic adjustment function as a potentiom-\neter, trimmer, or variable resistor. Each VR offers a completely\nprogrammable value of resistance between the A terminal and the\nwiper, or the B terminal and the wiper. For the AD5242 , the fixed\nA-to-B terminal resistance of 10 k Ω, 100 k Ω, or 1 M Ω has a 1%\nchannel-to-channel matching tolerance. The nominal temperature\ncoefficient of both parts is 30 ppm/°C.\nWiper position programming defaults to midscale at system power\non. When powered, the VR wiper position is programmed by an\nI2C-compatible, 2-wire serial data interface. Both parts have two\nextra programmable logic outputs available that enable users to\ndrive digital loads, logic gates, LED drivers, and analog switches in\ntheir system.\nThe AD5241/AD5242  are available in surface-mount, 14-lead SO-\nIC and 16-lead SOIC  packages and, for ultracompact solutions,\n14-lead TSSOP and 16-lead TSSOP  packages. All parts are guar-\nanteed to operate over the extended temperature range of −40°C to\n+105°C.\n1Patent Number 5,495,245 applies.\nData Sheet AD5241/AD5242\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalog.com Rev.

E | 12 of 17The AD5241/AD5242  provide a single-/dual-channel, 256-position\ndigitally controlled variable resistor (VR) device. The terms VR,\nRDAC, and programmable resistor are commonly used inter-\nchangeably to refer to digital potentiometer.\nTo program the VR settings, refer to the Digital Interface  section.\nBoth parts have an internal power-on preset that places the wiper in\nmidscale during power-on that simplifies the fault condition recovery\nat power-up. In addition, the shutdown pin ( SHDN ) of AD5241/\nAD5242  places the RDAC in an almost zero power consumption\nstate where Terminal A is open circuited and Wiper W is connected\nto Terminal B, resulting in only leakage current being consumed\nin the VR structure. During shutdown, the VR latch contents are\nmaintained when the RDAC is inactive. When the part returns from\nshutdown, the stored VR setting is applied to the RDAC.\nFigure 31. Equivalent RDAC Circuit\nPROGRAMMING THE VARIABLE RESISTOR\nRheostat Operation\nThe nominal resistance of the RDAC between Terminal A and\nTerminal B is available in 10 k Ω, 100 k Ω, and 1 M Ω. The final two\nor three digits of the part number determine the nominal resistance\nvalue, for example, 10 k Ω = 10, 100 k Ω = 100, and 1 M Ω = 1\nM. The nominal resistance (RAB) of the VR has 256 contact points\naccessed by the wiper terminal, plus the B terminal contact. The\n8-bit data in the RDAC latch is decoded to select one of the 256\npossible settings. Assume a 10 k Ω part is used; the first connection\nof the wiper starts at the B terminal for Data 0x00. Because\nthere is a 60 Ω wiper contact resistance, such connection yields\na minimum of 60 Ω resistance between Terminal W and Terminal\nB. The second connection is the first tap point that corresponds to\n99 Ω (RWB = RAB/256 + RW = 39 + 60) for Data 0x01. The third\nconnection is the next tap point representing 138 Ω (39 × 2 + 60)\nfor Data 0x02, and so on. Each LSB data value increase moves\nthe wiper up the resistor ladder until the last tap point is reached at\n10,021 Ω [RAB – 1 LSB + RW].\nFigure 31  shows a simplified diagram of the equivalent RDAC\ncircuit where the last resistor string is not accessed; therefore, there\nis 1 LSB less of the nominal resistance at full scale in addition to\nthe wiper resistance.The general equation determining the digitally programmed resist-\nance between W and B is\nR W B D =D\n256× R AB + R W (1)\nwhere:\nD is the decimal equivalent of the binary code between 0 and 255,\nwhich is loaded in the 8-bit RDAC register.\nRAB is the nominal end-to-end resistance.\nRW is the wiper resistance contributed by the on resistance of the\ninternal switch.\nAgain, if RAB = 10 k Ω, Terminal A can be either open circuit or tied\nto W. Table 7  shows the RWB resistance based on the code set in\nthe RDAC latch.\nTable 7. RWB (D) at Selected Codes for RAB = 10 k Ω\nD (DEC) RWB (Ω) Output State\n255 10,021 Full-scale (RWB – 1 LSB + RW)\n128 5060 Midscale\n1 99 1 LSB\n0 60 Zero-scale (wiper contact resistance)\nNote that in the zero-scale condition, a finite wiper resistance of 60\nΩ is present. Care should be taken to limit the current flow between\nW and B in this state to a maximum current of no more than 20 mA.\nOtherwise, degradation or possible destruction of the internal switch\ncontact can occur.\nSimilar to the mechanical potentiometer, the resistance of the\nRDAC between Wiper W and Terminal A also produces a digitally\ncontrolled resistance, RWA. When these terminals are used, Termi-\nnal B can be opened or tied to the wiper terminal. The minimum\nRWA resistance is for Data 0xFF and increases as the data loaded\nin the latch decreases in value. The general equation for this\noperation is\nR W A D =256 − D\n256× R AB + R W (2)\nFor RAB = 10 k Ω, Terminal B can be either open circuit or tied to\nW. Table 8  shows the RWA resistance based on the code set in the\nRDAC latch.\nTable 8.

Device-to-device\nmatching is process lot dependent, and it is possible to have ±30%\nvariation. Because the resistance element is processed in thin film\nData Sheet AD5241/AD5242\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 13 of 17technology, the change in RAB with temperature has no more than a\n30 ppm/°C temperature coefficient.\nPROGRAMMING THE POTENTIOMETER\nDIVIDER\nVoltage Output Operation\nThe digital potentiometer easily generates output voltages at wiper-\nto-B and wiper-to-A to be proportional to the input voltage at A-to-B.\nUnlike the polarity of VDD /VSS, which must be positive, voltage\nacross terminal A to terminal B, terminal W to terminal A, and\nterminal W to terminal B can be at either polarity provided that VSS\nis powered by a negative supply.\nIf ignoring the effect of the wiper resistance for approximation,\nconnecting Terminal A to 5 V and Terminal B to ground produces\nan output voltage at the wiper-to-B starting at 0 V up to 1 LSB less\nthan 5 V. Each LSB of voltage is equal to the voltage applied across\nTerminal AB divided by the 256 positions of the potentiometer divid-\ner. Because AD5241/AD5242  can be supplied by dual supplies,\nthe general equation defining the output voltage at VW with respect\nto ground for any valid input voltage applied to Terminal A and\nTerminal B is\nV W D =D\n256V A +256 − D\n256V B (3)\nwhich can be simplified to\nV W D =D\n256V AB + V B (4)\nwhere D is the decimal equivalent of the binary code between 0 to\n255 that is loaded in the 8-bit RDAC register.\nFor a more accurate calculation, including the effects of wiper\nresistance, VW can be found as\nV W D =R W B ( D )\nR ABV A +R W A ( D )\nR ABV B (5)\nwhere RWB(D) and RWA(D) can be obtained from Equation 1  and\nEquation 2 .\nOperation of the digital potentiometer in divider mode results in a\nmore accurate operation over temperature. Unlike rheostat mode,\nthe output voltage is dependent on the ratio of the internal resistors,\nRWA and RWB, and not the absolute values; therefore, the tempera-\nture drift reduces to 5 ppm/°C.\nDIGITAL INTERFACE\n2-Wire Serial Bus\nThe AD5241/AD5242  are controlled via an I2C-compatible serial\nbus. The RDACs are connected to this bus as slave devices.\nReferring to Figure 3  and Figure 4 , the first byte of AD5241/AD5242\nis a slave address byte. It has a 7-bit slave address and an R/ bit.\nThe five MSBs are 01011 and the following two bits are determinedby the state of the AD0 and AD1 pins of the device. AD0 and AD1\nallow users to use up to four of these devices on one bus.\nThe 2-wire, I2C serial bus protocol operates as follows:\n1.The master initiates a data transfer by establishing a start\ncondition, which is when a high-to-low transition on the SDA\nline occurs while SCL is high (see Figure 4 ). The following\nbyte is the Frame 1, slave address byte, which consists of the\n7-bit slave address followed by an R/ W bit (this bit determines\nwhether data is read from or written to the slave device).\n2.The slave whose address corresponds to the transmitted ad-\ndress responds by pulling the SDA line low during the ninth\nclock pulse (this is the acknowledge bit). At this stage, all other\ndevices on the bus remain idle while the selected device waits\nfor data to be written to or read from its serial register. If the\nR/W bit is high, the master reads from the slave device. If the\nR/W bit is low, the master writes to the slave device.\n3.A write operation contains an extra instruction byte more than\nthe read operation. The Frame 2 instruction byte in write mode\nfollows the slave address byte. The MSB of the instruction\nbyte labeled A/B is the RDAC subaddress select. A low se-\nlects RDAC1 and a high selects RDAC2 for the dual-channel\nAD5242 . Set A/B to low for the AD5241 . The second MSB, RS,\nis the midscale reset. A logic high of this bit moves the wiper\nof a selected RDAC to the center tap where RWA = RWB. The\nthird MSB, SD, is a shutdown bit. A logic high on SD causes the\nRDAC to open circuit at Terminal A while shorting the wiper to\nTerminal B. This operation yields almost a 0 Ω rheostat mode\nor 0 V in potentiometer mode. This SD bit serves the same\nfunction as the SHDN  pin except that the SHDN  pin reacts to\nactive low. The following two bits are O2 and O1. They are extra\nprogrammable logic outputs that users can use to drive other\ndigital loads, logic gates, LED drivers, analog switches, and the\nlike. The three LSBs are don’t care (see Figure 4 ).\n4.After acknowledging the instruction byte, the last byte in write\nmode is the, Frame 3 data byte. Data is transmitted over the\nserial bus in sequences of nine clock pulses (eight data bits\nfollowed by an acknowledge bit). The transitions on the SDA\nline must occur during the low period of SCL and remain stable\nduring the high period of SCL (see Figure 4 ).\n5.Unlike the write mode, the data byte follows immediately after\nthe acknowledgment of the slave address byte in Frame 2 read\nmode. Data is transmitted over the serial bus in sequences of\nnine clock pulses (slightly different from the write mode, there\nare eight data bits followed by a no acknowledge Logic 1 bit\nin read mode). Similarly, the transitions on the SDA line must\noccur during the low period of SCL and remain stable during the\nhigh period of SCL (see Figure 5 ).\n6.When all data bits have been read or written, a stop condition\nis established by the master. A stop condition is defined as a\nlow-to-high transition on the SDA line while SCL is high. In write\nmode, the master pulls the SDA line high during the tenth clock\npulse to establish a stop condition (see Figure 4 ). In read mode,\nData Sheet AD5241/AD5242\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 14 of 17the master issues a no acknowledge for the ninth clock pulse\n(that is, the SDA line remains high). The master then brings the\nSDA line low before the tenth clock pulse, which goes high to\nestablish a stop condition (see Figure 5 ).\nA repeated write function gives the user flexibility to update the\nRDAC output a number of times after addressing and instructing\nthe part only once. During the write cycle, each data byte updates\nthe RDAC output. For example, after the RDAC has acknowledged\nits slave address and instruction bytes, the RDAC output is updat-\ned. If another byte is written to the RDAC while it is still addressed\nto a specific slave device with the same instruction, this byte up-\ndates the output of the selected slave device. If different instructions\nare needed, the write mode has to start a completely new sequence\nwith a new slave address, instruction, and data bytes transferred\nagain. Similarly, a repeated read function of the RDAC is also\nallowed.\nREADBACK RDAC VALUE\nSpecific to the AD5242  dual-channel device, the channel of interest\nis the one that was previously selected in the write mode. In\naddition, to read both RDAC values consecutively, users have to\nperform two write-read cycles. For example, users may first specify\nthe RDAC1 subaddress in write mode (it is not necessary to issue\nthe data byte and stop condition), and then change to read mode\nto read the RDAC1 value. To continue reading the RDAC2 value,\nusers have to switch back to write mode, specify the subaddress,\nand then switch once again to read mode to read the RDAC2 value.\nIt is not necessary to issue the write mode data byte or the first\nstop condition for this operation. Users should refer to Figure 4  and\nFigure 5  for the programming format.\nMULTIPLE DEVICES ON ONE BUS\nFigure 32  shows four AD5242  devices on the same serial bus.\nEach has a different slave address because the state of their AD0\nand AD1 pins are different. This allows each RDAC within each\ndevice to be written to or read from independently. The master\ndevice output bus line drivers are open-drain pull-downs in a fully\nI2C-compatible interface. Note, a device is addressed properly only\nif the bit information of AD0 and AD1 in the slave address byte\nmatches with the logic inputs at the AD0 and AD1 pins of that\nparticular device.\nFigure 32. Multiple AD5242 Devices on One BusLEVEL-SHIFT FOR BIDIRECTIONAL\nINTERFACE\nWhile most old systems can operate at one voltage, a new compo-\nnent may be optimized at another. When they operate the same\nsignal at two different voltages, a proper method of level-shifting is\nneeded. For instance, a 3.3 V E2PROM can be used to interface\nwith a 5 V digital potentiometer. A level-shift scheme is needed\nto enable a bidirectional communication so that the setting of\nthe digital potentiometer can be stored to and retrieved from the\nE2PROM. Figure 33  shows one of the techniques. M1 and M2 can\nbe N-channel FETs (2N7002) or low threshold FDV301N if VDD falls\nbelow 2.5 V.\nFigure 33. Level-Shift for Different Voltage Devices Operation\nADDITIONAL PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC\nOUTPUT\nThe AD5241/AD5242  feature additional programmable logic out-\nputs, O1 and O2, that can be used to drive digital load, analog\nswitches, and logic gates. They can also be used as a self-con-\ntained shutdown preset to Logic 0 that is further explained in the\nShutdown Function  section. O1 and O2 default to Logic 0 during\npower-up. The logic states of O1 and O2 can be programmed in\nFrame 2 under the write mode (see Figure 4 ). Figure 34  shows\nthe output stage of O1, which employs large P-channel and N-chan-\nnel MOSFETs in push-pull configuration. As shown in Figure 34 ,\nthe output is equal to VDD or VSS, and these logic outputs have\nadequate current driving capability to drive milliamperes of load.\nFigure 34. Output Stage of Logic Output, O1\nUsers can also activate O1 and O2 in the following three different\nways without affecting the wiper settings:\n1.Start, slave address byte, acknowledge, instruction byte with O1\nand O2 specified, acknowledge, stop.\n2.Complete the write cycle with stop, then start, slave address\nbyte, acknowledge, instruction byte with O1 and O2 specified,\nacknowledge, stop.\n3.Do not complete the write cycle by not issuing the stop, then\nstart, slave address byte, acknowledge, instruction byte with O1\nand O2 specified, acknowledge, stop.\nData Sheet AD5241/AD5242\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 15 of 17All digital inputs are protected with a series input resistor and the\nparallel Zener ESD structures shown in Figure 36 . This applies to\nthe digital input pins, SDA, SCL, and SHDN .\nSHUTDOWN FUNCTION\nShutdown can be activated by strobing the SHDN  pin or program-\nming the SD bit in the write mode instruction byte (see Table 3 ). If\nthe RDAC Register 1 or RDAC Register 2 ( AD5242  only) is placed\nin shutdown mode by the software, SD bit, the part returns the\nwiper to its prior position when a new command is received.\nIn addition, shutdown can be implemented with the device digital\noutput, as shown in Figure 35 . In this configuration, the device is\nshutdown during power-up but users are allowed to program the\ndevice. Thus, when O1 is programmed high, the device exits shut-\ndown mode and responds to the new setting. This self-contained\nshutdown function allows absolute shutdown during power-up,\nwhich is crucial in hazardous environments, and it does not add\nextra components.Figure 35.
