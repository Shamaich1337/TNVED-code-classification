High Signal Level Downmixer for Wireless InfrastructureThe LT®5522 active downconverting mixer is optimized for\nhigh linearity downconverter applications including cable\nand wireless infrastructure. The IC includes a high speed\ndifferential LO buffer amplifier driving a double-balanced\nmixer. The LO buffer is internally matched for wideband,single-ended operation with no external components.\nThe RF input port incorporates an integrated RF trans-\nformer and is internally matched over the 1.2GHz to 2.3GHzfrequency range with no external components. The RF\ninput match can be shifted down to 400MHz, or up to\n2.7GHz, with a single shunt capacitor or inductor, respec-tively. The high level of integration minimizes the total\nsolution cost, board space and system-level variation.\nThe LT5522 delivers high performance and small size\nwithout excessive power consumption.\nLTC1748\nADC\n5522 F01140MHz\n(TYP) 1850MHz\nTO\n1910MHz100pF2.7pFIF+LO–LT5522LO+LO INPUT\n–5dBm\nIF–RF+\nRF–\nEN V CC1 VCC2150nH150nH\n0.01 µF 3.3 µF5VBIAS/\nCONTROLVGA\nLNA\nLO INPUT POWER (dBm)–110GC, SSB NF (dB), IIP3 (dBm)\n481216\n–9 –7 –5 –3\n5522 TA01–1 120IIP324\n22\nIF = 140MHz\nLOW-SIDE LOT\nA = 25 °C\nVCC = 5V26101418\n–70–60LO-RF LEAKAGE (dBm)\n–50–40–30–20–10SSB NF\nLO-RF1.9GHz Conversion Gain, IIP3, SSB\nNF and LO-RF Leakage vs LO PowerFEATURES DESCRIPTIOU\nAPPLICATIO  SU\nTYPICAL APPLICATIOU\nLT5522\n25522faSupply Voltage ......................................................  5.5V\nEnable Voltage ...............................  –0.3V to V CC + 0.3V\nLO Input Power ...............................................  +10dBm\nLO+ to LO– Differential DC Voltage .........................  ±1V\nLO Input DC Common Mode Voltage ......................  ±1V\nRF Input Power ................................................  +10dBmRF\n+ to RF– Differential DC Voltage ........................ ±0.2V\nRF Input DC Common Mode Voltage ......................  ±1V\nOperating Temperature Range ................ –40 °C to 85 °C\nStorage Temperature Range ................. –65 °C to 125 °C\nJunction Temperature (T J).................................... 125 °C(Note 1)ABSOLUTE    AXI   U    RATI  GSWWW UPACKAGE/ORDER I  FOR   ATIOUU W\n(Test circuit shown in Figure 2) V CC = 5VDC, EN = high, T A = 25 °C,\nunless otherwise noted.

The IC has been opti-mized for downconverter applications where the RF input\nsignal is in the 400MHz to 2.7GHz range and the LO signal\nis in the 400MHz to 2.7GHz range. Operation over a widerRF input frequency range is possible with reduced\nperformance.\nThe IF output can be matched for IF frequencies as low as\n100kHz or as high as 1GHz. The RF, LO and IF ports are all\ndifferential, although the RF and LO ports are internally\nmatched for single-ended drive as shown in Figure 2. TheLT5522 is characterized and production-tested with single-\nended RF and LO drive. Low side or high side LO injection\ncan be used.\nTwo evaluation boards are available. The standard board\nis intended for most applications, including cellular, PCS,\nUMTS and 2.4GHz. A schematic is shown in Figure 2 andthe board layout is shown in Figure 18. The 140MHz IF\noutput frequency on the standard board is easily changed\nby modifying the IF matching elements. The second board,intended for CATV applications, incorporates a wideband\nIF output balun. The CATV evaluation schematic is shown\nin Figure 3 and the board layout is shown in Figure 19.RF Input Port\nThe mixer’s RF input, shown in Figure 4, consists of an\nintegrated balun and a high linearity differential amplifier.\nThe primary terminals of the balun are connected to the\nRF\n+ and RF– pins (Pins 2 and 3, respectively). The second-\nary side of the balun is internally connected to the amplifier’s\ndifferential inputs. For single-ended operation, the RF+ pin\nis grounded and the RF– pin becomes the RF input. It is\nalso possible to ground the RF– pin and drive the RF+ pin,\nalthough the LO to RF isolation will degrade slightly.\nThe RF source must be AC-coupled since one terminal of\nthe balun’s primary is grounded. If the RF source has DC\nvoltage present, then a coupling capacitor must be used in\nseries with the RF input pin.\nAs shown in Figure 5, the RF input return loss, with no\nexternal matching, is greater than 10dB from 1.2GHz to\n2.4GHz. The RF input match can be shifted down infrequency by adding a shunt capacitor at the RF input. Two\nexamples are plotted in Figure 5. A 2.2pF capacitor,\nlocated near Pin 3, produces a 900MHz match. An 8.2pFcapacitor, located 5mm away from Pin 3 (on the 50 Ω line),\nproduces a 450MHz match. The RF input match can alsobe shifted up in frequency by adding a shunt inductor nearPin 3.  One example is plotted in Figure 5, where a 3.9nH\ninductor produces a 2.3GHz to 2.8GHz match.\n2RF+LT5522\n3RF–RF IN\nC5\nOPTIONAL SHUNT\nREACTANCE\nFOR LOW BAND\nOR HIGH BAND\nMATCHING (C5 OR L3)TO\nMIXER\n5522 F04\nFigure 4.

The listed data is referenced to the RF– pin with\nthe RF+ pin grounded (no external matching). This infor-\nmation can be used to simulate board-level interfacing toan input filter, or to design a broadband input matching\nnetwork.\nA broadband RF input match is easily realized using the\nshunt inductor/series capacitor network shown in Fig-\nure 6. This network provides good return loss at low and\nhigh frequencies simultaneously, with reasonablemidband return loss. As shown in Figure 7, the RF input\nreturn loss is greater than 12dB from 715MHz to 2.3GHz\nusing the element values shown in Figure 6. The inputmatch is optimum at 850MHz and 1900MHz, ideal for tri-\nband GSM applications.\nTable 1.

Both pins must be biased at the supply voltage,\nwhich can be applied through the center-tap of a trans-\nformer or through matching inductors. Each IF pin draws15mA of supply current (30mA total). For optimum\nsingle-ended performance, these differential outputs\nshould be combined externally through an IF trans-former. Both evaluation boards include IF transformers\nfor impedance transformation and differential to single-\nended transformation.\nThe IF output impedance can be modeled as 400 Ω in\nparallel with 1pF. An equivalent small-signal model (in-cluding bondwire inductance) is shown in Figure 11. Formost applications, the bondwire inductance can be\nignored.APPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nFigure 11.

Matching elements C4, L1 and\nL2 form a 400 Ω to 200Ω lowpass matching network\nwhich is tuned to the desired IF frequency. The 4:1\ntransformer then transforms the 200 Ω differential output\nto 50Ω single-ended. The value of C4 is reduced by 1pF to\naccount for the equivalent internal capacitance.\nFor optimum linearity, C4 must be located close to the IF\npins. Excessive trace length or inductance between the IFpins and C4 will increase the amplitude of the image output\nand reduce voltage swing headroom for the desired IF\nfrequency. High Q wire-wound chip inductors (L1 and L2)improve the mixer’s conversion gain by a few tenths of a\ndB, but have little effect on linearity.\nThis matching network is most suitable for IF frequencies\nof 40MHz or above. Below 40MHz, the value of the series\ninductors (L1 and L2) is high, and could cause stability\nproblems, depending on the inductor value and parasitics.Therefore, the 8:1 transformer technique is recommended\nfor low IF frequencies.\nSuggested matching network values for several IF fre-\nquencies are listed in Table 3. Measured output return\nlosses for the 140MHz match and the wideband CATV\nmatch are plotted in Figure 13.\nTable 3.

As shown in Figure 14, supply voltage\nto the mixer’s IF pins is applied through matching induc-\ntors in a bandpass IF matching network. The values of L1,L2 and C4 are calculated to resonate at the desired IF\nfrequency with a quality factor that satisfies the required IF\nbandwidth. The L and C values are then adjusted toaccount for the mixer’s internal 1pF capacitance and theSAW filter’s input capacitance. In this case, the differentialIF output impedance is 400 Ω, since the bandpass network\ndoes not transform the impedance.\nFor low cost applications, it is possible to replace the IF\ntransformer with a lumped-element network which pro-\nduces a single-ended 50 Ω output. One approach is shown\nin Figure 15, where L1, L2, C4 and C6 form a narrowband\nbridge balun. The L and C values are calculated to realize\na 180 degree phase shift at the desired IF frequency using\nthe equations listed below. Inductor L4 is calculated tocancel the internal 1pF capacitance. L3 also supplies bias\nvoltage to the IF\n+ pin. Low cost multilayer chip inductors\nare adequate for L1 and L2. A high Q wire-wound chipAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nFigure 13.
