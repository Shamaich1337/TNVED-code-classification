Parallel-in access to each stage is \nprovided by eight individual direct data inputs that are enabled by a low level at the shift/load (SH/ LD) input. \nThe ’LV165A devices feature a clock-inhibit function and a complemented serial output, Q H.\nClocking is accomplished by a low-to-high transition of the clock (CLK) input while SH/ LD is held high and clock \ninhibit (CLK INH) is held low. The functions of CLK and CLK INH are interchangeable. Since a low CLK and a \nlow-to-high transition of CLK INH accomplishes clocking, CLK INH must be changed to the high level only while \nCLK is high. Parallel loading is inhibited when SH/ LD is held high. The parallel inputs to the register are enabled \nwhile SH/ LD is held low, independently of the levels of CLK, CLK INH, or SER.\nThis device is fully specified for partial-power-down applications using I off. The I off circuitry disables the outputs, \npreventing damaging current backflow through the devices when they are powered down.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nSH/LD\nSER\nCLK INH\nCLKA\nDS R\nQB\nDS R\nQ5 Additional\nShift Register\nStagesC D E F G H\nDS R\nQ\nQQH\nQH\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Balanced CMOS Push-Pull Outputs\nThis device includes balanced CMOS push-pull outputs. The term balanced  indicates that the device can sink \nand source similar currents. The drive capability of this device may create fast edges into light loads, so routing \nand load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing. Additionally, the outputs of this device are capable \nof driving larger currents than the device can sustain without being damaged. It is important for the output power \nof the device to be limited to avoid damage due to overcurrent. The electrical and thermal limits defined in the \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  must be followed at all times.\nUnused push-pull CMOS outputs should be left disconnected.\n8.3.2 Latching Logic\nThis device includes latching logic circuitry. Latching circuits commonly include D-type latches and D-type \nflip-flops, but include all logic circuits that act as volatile memory.\nWhen the device is powered on, the state of each latch is unknown. There is no default state for each latch at \nstart-up.\nThe output state of each latching logic circuit only remains stable as long as power is applied to the device within \nthe supply voltage range specified in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table.\nwww.ti.comSN74LV165A\nSCLS402Q – APRIL 1998 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LV165A\n8.3.3 Partial Power Down (I off)\nThis device includes circuitry to disable all outputs when the supply pin is held at 0 V. When disabled, the \noutputs will neither source nor sink current, regardless of the input voltages applied. The amount of leakage \ncurrent at each output is defined by the I off specification in the Electrical Characteristics  table.\n8.3.4 Clamp Diode Structure\nFigure 8-1  shows the inputs and outputs to this device have negative clamping diodes only.\nCAUTION\nVoltages beyond the values specified in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  table can cause damage \nto the device.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN74LV165A is a low drive CMOS device that can be used for a multitude of bus interface type applications \nwhere output ringing is a concern. The low-drive and slow-edge rates minimize overshoot and undershoot on the \noutputs.\n9.2 Typical Application\nSystem\nControllerSER\nCLK INHSH/LD\n8-Bit Shift RegisterA B C D E F G H\nData Loading Gates\nCLK\nControl\nLogicQHQH\nPeripheralDATA[7:0]\nFigure 9-1. Input Expansion with Shift Registers\n9.2.1 Power Considerations\nEnsure the desired supply voltage is within the range specified in the Recommended Operating Conditions . The \nsupply voltage sets the device\'s electrical characteristics as described in the Electrical Characteristics  section.\nThe positive voltage supply must be capable of sourcing current equal to the total current to be sourced by all \noutputs of the SN74LV165A  plus the maximum static supply current, I CC, listed in the Electrical Characteristics , \nand any transient current required for switching. The logic device can only source as much current that is \nprovided by the positive supply source. Be sure to not exceed the maximum total current through V CC listed in \nthe Absolute Maximum Ratings .\nThe ground must be capable of sinking current equal to the total current to be sunk by all outputs of the \nSN74LV165A  plus the maximum supply current, I CC, listed in the Electrical Characteristics , and any transient \ncurrent required for switching. The logic device can only sink as much current that can be sunk into its ground \nconnection. Be sure to not exceed the maximum total current through GND listed in the Absolute Maximum \nRatings .\nThe SN74LV165A  can drive a load with a total capacitance less than or equal to 50 pF while still meeting all of \nthe data sheet specifications. Larger capacitive loads can be applied; however, it is not recommended to exceed \n50 pF.\nThe SN74LV165A  can drive a load with total resistance described by R L ≥ VO / IO, with the output voltage and \ncurrent defined in the Electrical Characteristics  table with VOH and VOL. When outputting in the HIGH state, the \noutput voltage in the equation is defined as the difference between the measured output voltage and the supply \nvoltage at the V CC pin.SN74LV165A\nSCLS402Q – APRIL 1998 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LV165A\nTotal power consumption can be calculated using the information provided in CMOS Power Consumption and \nCpd Calculation .\nThermal increase can be calculated using the information provided in Thermal Characteristics of Standard Linear \nand Logic (SLL) Packages and Devices .\nCAUTION\nThe maximum junction temperature, T J(max)  listed in the Absolute Maximum Ratings , is an additional \nlimitation to prevent damage to the device. Do not violate any values listed in the Absolute Maximum \nRatings . These limits are provided to prevent damage to the device.\n9.2.2 Input Considerations\nInput signals must cross VIL(max)  to be considered a logic LOW, and VIH(min)  to be considered a logic HIGH. Do \nnot exceed the maximum input voltage range found in the  Absolute Maximum Ratings .\nUnused inputs must be terminated to either V CC or ground. The unused inputs can be directly terminated if the \ninput is completely unused, or they can be connected with a pull-up or pull-down resistor if the input will be used \nsometimes, but not always. A pull-up resistor is used for a default state of HIGH, and a pull-down resistor is used \nfor a default state of LOW. The drive current of the controller, leakage current into the SN74LV165A  (as specified \nin the Electrical Characteristics ), and the desired input transition rate limits the resistor size. A 10-k Ω resistor \nvalue is often used due to these factors.\nThe SN74LV165A  has CMOS inputs and thus requires fast input transitions to operate correctly, as defined in \nthe Recommended Operating Conditions  table. Slow input transitions can cause oscillations, additional power \nconsumption, and reduction in device reliability.\nRefer to the Feature Description  section for additional information regarding the inputs for this device.\n9.2.3 Output Considerations\nThe positive supply voltage is used to produce the output HIGH voltage. Drawing current from the output will \ndecrease the output voltage as specified by the V OH specification in the Electrical Characteristics . The ground \nvoltage is used to produce the output LOW voltage. Sinking current into the output will increase the output \nvoltage as specified by the V OL specification in the Electrical Characteristics .\nPush-pull outputs that could be in opposite states, even for a very short time period, should never be connected \ndirectly together. This can cause excessive current and damage to the device.\nTwo channels within the same device with the same input signals can be connected in parallel for additional \noutput drive strength.\nUnused outputs can be left floating. Do not connect outputs directly to V CC or ground.\nRefer to the Feature Description  section for additional information regarding the outputs for this device.\nwww.ti.comSN74LV165A\nSCLS402Q – APRIL 1998 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LV165A\n9.2.4 Detailed Design Procedure\n1.Add a decoupling capacitor from V CC to GND. The capacitor needs to be placed physically close to the \ndevice and electrically close to both the V CC and GND pins. An example layout is shown in the Layout \nsection.\n2.Ensure the capacitive load at the output is ≤ 50 pF. This is not a hard limit; it will, however, ensure optimal \nperformance. This can be accomplished by providing short, appropriately sized traces from the SN74LV165A \nto one or more of the receiving devices.\n3.Ensure the resistive load at the output is larger than (V CC / IO(max) ) Ω. This will ensure that the maximum \noutput current from the Absolute Maximum Ratings  is not violated. Most CMOS inputs have a resistive load \nmeasured in MΩ; much larger than the minimum calculated previously.\n4.Thermal issues are rarely a concern for logic gates; the power consumption and thermal increase, however, \ncan be calculated using the steps provided in the application report, CMOS Power Consumption and Cpd \nCalculation .\n9.2.5 Application Curve\nQHCLKSH/LDDATA [7:0] 0x00 0x11 0x00\nFigure 9-2.

Each V CC terminal must have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. For \ndevices with a single supply, TI recommends a 0.1- μF capacitor and if there are multiple V CC terminals then \nTI recommends a 0.01- μF or 0.022- μF capacitor for each power terminal. Multiple bypass capacitors can be \nparalleled to reject different frequencies of noise. Frequencies of 0.1 μF and 1 μF are commonly used in parallel. \nThe bypass capacitor must be installed as close as possible to the power terminal for best results.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple bit logic devices, inputs should not float. In many cases, functions or parts of functions of \ndigital logic devices are unused. Some examples are when only two inputs of a triple-input AND gate are used, \nor when only 3 of the 4-buffer gates are used. Such unused input pins must not be left unconnected because \nthe undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. All unused inputs of \ndigital logic devices must be connected to a logic high or logic low voltage, as defined by the input voltage \nspecifications, to prevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular unused input \ndepends on the function of the device. Generally, the inputs are tied to GND or V CC, whichever makes more \nsense for the logic function or is more convenient.\n11.2 Layout Example\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n716\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10 \nSH/LD\nCLK\nF\nGGND V CC\nCLK INH\nD\nB\nA\nSER\nGNDVCC\nCE0.1 \x1dFBypass capacitor \nplaced close to the \ndevice\nAvoid 90°  \ncorners for \nsignal linesRecommend GND flood fill for \nimproved signal isolation, noise \nreduction, and thermal dissipation\nUnused input \ntied to V CCQH\nQH 8 9H\nUnused output \nleft floating\nFigure 11-1.

#### Description:
The **SN74LV165A** is a parallel-load, 8-bit shift register designed for low-voltage operation ranging from 2 V to 5.5 V. It allows data to be shifted toward the serial output (Q_H) when clocked. The device features eight individual direct data inputs that can be accessed in parallel when the shift/load (SH/LD) input is low. It also includes a clock-inhibit function and a complemented serial output (Q_H). The device is suitable for partial-power-down applications, preventing damaging current backflow when powered down.

#### Typical Applications:
The SN74LV165A is commonly used in applications that require:
- **Input Expansion**: Increasing the number of inputs on microcontrollers.
- **Data Storage**: Temporary storage of data in digital circuits.
- **Bus Interface**: Facilitating communication between different components in a system.
- **Signal Processing**: Shifting data for processing in various digital applications.

This component is ideal for use in low-power applications where space and efficiency are critical, such as in portable devices and embedded systems.
