This device delivers very high PSRR(over 75 dB at 1 kHz) and excellent dynamic performanceas load/line transients. In connection with very lowquiescent current this device is very suitable for various\nbattery powered applications such as tablets, cellular\nphones, wireless and many others. The device is fullyprotected in case of output overload, output short circuitcondition and overheating, assuring a very robust design.\nInput Capacitor Selection (C IN)\nIt is recommended to connect at least a 1 /C0109F Ceramic  X5R\nor X7R capacitor as close as possible to the IN pin of thedevice. This capacitor will provide a low impedance path for\nunwanted  AC signals or noise modulated onto constant\ninput voltage. There is no requirement for the min. /max.ESR of the  input capacitor but it is recommended to use\nceramic  capacitors for their low ESR and ESL. A good input\ncapacitor will limit the influence of input trace inductance\nand source resistance during sudden load current changes.\nLarger input capacitor may be necessary if fast and largeload transients are encountered in the application.\nOutput Decoupling (C OUT)\nThe NCP114 requires an output capacitor connected as\nclose as possible to the output pin of the regulator. The\nrecommended capacitor value is 1 /C0109F and X7R or X5R\ndielectric due to its low capacitance variations over thespecified temperature range. The NCP114 is designed toremain stable with minimum effective capacitance of\n0.22/C0109F to account for changes with temperature, DC bias\nand package size. Especially for small package sizecapacitors such as 0402 the effective capacitance drops\nrapidly with the applied DC bias.\nThere is no requirement for the minimum value of\nEquivalent Series Resistance (ESR) for the C\nOUT but the\nmaximum value of ESR should be less than 2 /C0087. Larger\noutput capacitors and lower ESR could improve the loadtransient response or high frequency PSRR. It is notrecommended to use tantalum capacitors on the  output due\nto their large ESR. The equivalent series  resistance of\ntantalum capacitors is also strongly dependent  on the\ntemperature, increasing at low temperature.\nEnable Operation\nThe NCP114 uses the EN pin to enable/disable its device\nand to deactivate/activate the active discharge function.\nIf the EN pin voltage is <0.4 V the device is guaranteed to\nbe disabled. The pass transistor is turned −off so that there is\nvirtually no current flow between the IN and OUT. Theactive discharge transistor is active so that the output voltage\nV\nOUT is pulled to GND through a 100 /C0087 resistor. In thedisable state the device consumes as low as typ. 10 nA from\nthe V IN.\nIf the EN pin voltage >0.9 V the device is guaranteed to\nbe enabled. The NCP114 regulates the output voltage and\nthe active discharge transistor is turned −off.\nThe EN pin has internal pull −down current source with\ntyp. value of 300 nA which assures that the device isturned−off when the EN pin is not connected. In the case\nwhere the EN function isn’t required the EN should be tieddirectly to IN.\nOutput Current Limit\nOutput Current is internally limited within the IC to a\ntypical 600 mA. The NCP114 will source this amount ofcurrent measured with a voltage drops on the 90% of thenominal V\nOUT. If the Output V oltage is directly shorted to\nground (V OUT = 0 V), the short circuit protection will limit\nthe output current to 630 mA (typ). The current limit and\nshort circuit protection will work properly over wholetemperature range and also input voltage range. There is no\nlimitation for the short circuit duration.\nThermal Shutdown\nWhen the die temperature exceeds the Thermal Shutdown\nthreshold (T SD − 160°C typical), Thermal Shutdown event\nis detected and the device is disabled. The IC will remain inthis state until the die temperature decreases below theThermal Shutdown Reset threshold (T\nSDU − 140°C typical).\nOnce the IC temperature falls below the 140 °C the LDO is\nenabled again. The thermal shutdown feature provides the\nprotection from a catastrophic device failure due to\naccidental overheating. This protection is not intended to be\nused as a substitute for proper heat sinking.\nPower Dissipation\nAs power dissipated in the NCP114 increases, it might\nbecome necessary to provide some thermal relief. The\nmaximum power dissipation supported by the device isdependent upon board design and layout. Mounting padconfiguration on the PCB, the board material, and theambient temperature af fect the rate of junction temperature\nrise for the part.\nThe maximum power dissipation the NCP114 can handle\nis given by:\nPD(MAX)/C0043/C042685°C/C0042TA/C0427\n/C0113JA(eq. 1)\nThe power dissipated by the NCP114 for given\napplication conditions can be calculated from the following\nequations:\n \nPD/C0091VIN/C0466IGND@IOUT/C0467/C0041IOUT/C0466VIN/C0042VOUT/C0467 (eq. 2)\nNCP114\nwww. onsemi.com\n14Figure 45. /C0113JA vs. Copper Area (uDFN4)140170200230260290\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\nCOPPER HEAT SPREADER AREA (mm2)/C0113JA, JUNCTION −TO−AMBIENT\nTHERMAL RESISTANCE ( °C/W)PD(MAX) , TA = 25 °C, 2 oz Cu\nPD(MAX) , MAXIMUM POWER\nDISSIPATION (W)PD(MAX) , TA = 25 °C, 1 oz Cu\n/C0113JA, 1 oz Cu\n/C0113JA, 2 oz Cu0.5\n0.40.30.20.10.0\nFigure 46. /C0113JA vs. Copper Area (TSOP −5)0.3\n150200250300350400450\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\nCOPPER HEAT SPREADER AREA (mm2)/C0113JA, JUNCTION −TO−AMBIENT\nTHERMAL RESISTANCE ( °C/W)PD(MAX) , TA = 25 °C, 2 oz Cu\nPD(MAX) , MAXIMUM POWER\nDISSIPATION (W)PD(MAX) , TA = 25 °C, 1 oz Cu\n/C0113JA, 1 oz Cu\n/C0113JA, 2 oz Cu0.25\n0.20.15\n0.1\n0.050\nReverse Current\nThe PMOS pass transistor has an inherent body diode\nwhich will be forward biased in the case that V OUT > V IN.\nDue to this fact in cases, where the extended reverse currentcondition can be anticipated the device may requireadditional external protection.\nPower Supply Rejection Ratio\nThe NCP114 features very good Power Supply Rejection\nratio. If desired the PSRR at higher frequencies in the range100 kHz − 10 MHz can be tuned by the selection of C\nOUT\ncapacitor and proper PCB layout.\nTurn−On Time\nThe turn−on time is defined as the time period from EN\nassertion to the point in which V OUT  will reach 98% of itsnominal value. This time is dependent on various\napplication conditions such as V OUT(NOM) , COUT and T A.\nFor example typical value for V OUT = 1.2 V , C OUT = 1 /C0109F,\nIOUT = 1 mA and T A = 25 °C is 90 /C0109s.\nPCB Layout Recommendations\nTo obtain good transient performance and good regulation\ncharacteristics place C IN and C OUT capacitors close to the\ndevice pins and make the PCB traces wide. In order to\nminimize the solution size, use 0402 capacitors. Larger\ncopper area connected to the pins will also improve thedevice thermal resistance. The actual power dissipation can\nbe calculated from the equation above (Equation 2). Exposepad should be tied the shortest path to the GND pin.\nNCP114\nwww. onsemi.com\n15ORDERING INFORMATION\nDeviceVoltage\nOption MarkingMarking\nRotation Option Package Shipping†\nNCP114AMX075TCG 0.75 V AW 0°\nWith active output\ndischarge functionUDFN4\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & ReelNCP114AMX080TCG 0.80 V AT 0°\nNCP114AMX090TAG 0.9 V AP 0°\nNCP114AMX090TCG 0.9 V AP 0°\nNCP114AMX092TAG 0.92 V A2 0°\nNCP114AMX100TCG 1.0 V 6 180°\nNCP114AMX105TCG 1.05 V R 0°\nNCP114AMX110TBG 1.1 V F 180°\nNCP114AMX110TCG 1.1 V F 180°\nNCP114AMX115TCG 1.15 V AM 0°\nNCP114AMX120TBG 1.2 V T 0°\nNCP114AMX120TCG 1.2 V T 0°\nNCP114AMX125TCG 1.25 V A 180°\nNCP114AMX130TCG 1.3 V AA 0°\nNCP114AMX135TCG 1.35 V AN 0°\nNCP114AMX150TCG 1.5 V V 0°\nNCP114AMX160TCG 1.6 V 2 180°\nNCP114AMX180TBG 1.8 V J 180°\nNCP114AMX180TCG 1.8 V J 180°\nNCP114AMX185TCG 1.85 V Y 0°\nNCP114AMX210TCG 2.1 V L 180°\nNCP114AMX220TCG 2.2 V Q 180°\nNCP114AMX240TCG 2.4 V AH 0°\nNCP114AMX250TBG 2.5 V AF 0°\nNCP114AMX250TCG 2.5 V AF 0°\nNCP114AMX260TCG 2.6 V T 180°\nNCP114AMX270TCG 2.7 V AJ 0°\nNCP114AMX280TBG 2.8 V 2 0°\nNCP114AMX280TCG 2.8 V 2 0°\nNCP114AMX285TCG 2.85 V 3 0°\nNCP114AMX290TCG 2.9 V AZ 0°\nNCP114AMX300TCG 3.0 V 4 0°\nNCP114AMX310TBG 3.1 V 5 0°\nNCP114AMX310TCG 3.1 V 5 0°\nNCP114AMX320TCG 3.2 V AG 0°\nNCP114AMX330TBG 3.3 V 6 0°\nNCP114AMX330TCG 3.3 V 6 0°\nNCP114AMX345TCG 3.45 V AC 0°\nNCP114AMX350TCG 3.5 V 4 180°\nNCP114AMX360TCG 3.6 V AU 0°\nNCP114\nwww. onsemi.com\n16ORDERING INFORMATION\nDevice Shipping†Package OptionMarking\nRotation MarkingVoltage\nOption\nNCP114BMX075TCG 0.75 V CW 0°\nWithout active output\ndischarge functionUDFN4\n(Pb-Free)3000 / Tape & ReelNCP114BMX100TCG 1.0 V 6 270°\nNCP114BMX120TCG 1.2 V T 90°\nNCP114BMX150TCG 1.5 V V 90°\nNCP114BMX180TCG 1.8 V J 270°\nNCP114BMX250TCG 2.5 V CF 0°\nNCP114BMX280TCG 2.8 V 2 90°\nNCP114BMX300TCG 3.0 V 4 90°\nNCP114BMX330TCG 3.3 V 6 90°\n†For information on tape and reel specifications, including part orientation and tape sizes, please refer to our Tape and Reel Packaging\nSpecifications Brochure, BRD8011/D.\nORDERING INFORMATION\nDevice Voltage Option Marking Option Package Shipping†\nNCP114ASN080T1G 0.8 V CAY\nWith output active\ndischarge functionTSOP−5\n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & ReelNCP114ASN120T1G 1.2 V CAC\nNCP114ASN120T2G\nNCP114ASN150T1G 1.5 V CAX\nNCP114ASN150T2G\nNCP114ASN180T1G 1.8 V CAD\nNCP114ASN180T2G\nNCP114ASN250T1G 2.5 V CAG\nNCP114ASN250T2G\nNCP114ASN260T1G 2.6 V CAQ\nNCP114ASN270T1G 2.7 V CAV\nNCP114ASN280T1G 2.8 V CAH\nNCP114ASN280T2G\nNCP114ASN290T1G 2.9 V CAU\nNCP114ASN300T1G 3.0 V CAK\nNCP114ASN330T1G 3.3 V CAL\nNCP114ASN330T2G\nNCP114BSN330T1G 3.3 V CDL Without output\nactive discharge\n†For information on tape and reel specifications, including part orientation and tape sizes, please refer to our Tape and Reel Packaging\nSpecifications Brochure, BRD8011/D.\nTSOP−5\nCASE 483\nISSUE N\nDATE  12 AUG 2020\nSCALE 2:1\n15\nXXX M /C0071\n/C0071GENERIC\nMARKING DIAGRAM*15\n0.7\n0.0281.0\n0.039\n/C0466mm\ninches/C0467 SCALE 10:10.95\n0.037\n2.4\n0.0941.9\n0.074\n*For additional information on our Pb −Free strategy and soldering\ndetails, please download the ON Semiconductor Soldering and\nMounting Techniques Reference Manual, SOLDERRM/D.SOLDERING FOOTPRINT*\n*This information is generic.
