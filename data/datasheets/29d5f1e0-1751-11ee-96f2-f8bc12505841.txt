While these die capabilities\nrepresent a major advance over what was availablejust a few years ago, it is  important for power MOSFET\npackaging technology to keep pace. It should be obvi-ous that degradation of a high performance die by thepackage is undesirable. \nPowerPAK is a new package\ntechnology that addresses these issues. The PowerPAK\n1212-8 provides ultra-low thermal impedance in asmall package that is ideal for space-constrainedapplications. In this application note, the PowerPAK1212-8’s construction is described. Fo llowing this,\nmounting information is presented. Finally, thermaland electrical performance is discussed.\nTHE PowerPAK PACKAGE\nThe PowerPAK 1212-8 package (Figure 1) is a deriva-\ntive of PowerPAK SO-8. It utilizes the same packaging\ntechnology, maximizing the die area. The bottom of the\ndie attach pad is exposed to provide a direct, low resis-\ntance thermal path to the substrate the device ismounted on. The PowerPAK 1212-8 thus translatesthe benefits of the Powe rPAK SO-8 into a smaller\npackage, with the same level of thermal performance.\n(Please refer to application note “PowerPAK SO-8\nMounting and Thermal Considerations.”)The PowerPAK 1212-8 has a footprint area compara-\nble to TSOP-6. It is over 40 % smaller than standardTSSOP-8. Its die capacity is more than twice the sizeof the standard TSOP-6’s. It has thermal performancean order of magnitude better than the SO-8, and 20times better than TSSOP-8. Its thermal performance isbetter than all current SMT packages in the market. Itwill take the advant age of any PC board heat sink\ncapability. Bringing the junc tion temperature down also\nincreases the die efficiency by around 20 % compared\nwith TSSOP-8. For applications where bigger pack-ages are typically required solely for thermal consider-ation, the PowerPAK 1212- 8 is a good option.\nBoth the single and dual Po werPAK 1212-8 utilize the\nsame pin-outs as the single  and dual PowerPAK SO-8.\nThe low 1.05 mm PowerPAK height profile makes both\nversions an excellent choice for applications withspace constraints.\nPowerPAK 1212 SINGLE MOUNTING\nTo take the advantage of th e single PowerPAK 1212-8’s\nthermal performance see Application Note 826,\nRecommended Minimum Pad Patterns With Outline\nDrawing Access for Vishay Siliconix MOSFETs.  Click\non the PowerPAK 1212-8 single in the index of thisdocument. \nIn this figure, the drain land pattern is given to make full\ncontact to the drain pa d on the PowerPAK package.\nThis land pattern can be extended to the left, right, and\ntop of the drawn pattern. This ex tension will serve to\nincrease the heat dissipation by decreasing the ther-mal resistance from the foot of the PowerPAK to thePC board and therefore to the ambient. Note thatincreasing the drain land area beyond a certain pointwill yield little decrease in foot-to-board and foot-to-\nambient thermal resistance. Under specific conditionsof board configuration, copper weight, and layer stack,experiments have found that adding copper beyond anarea of about 0.3 to 0.5 in\n2 of will yield little improve-\nment in thermal performance.\nFigure 1.  PowerPAK 1212 Devices\n\nwww.vishay.com\n2Document Number 71681\n03-Mar-06Vishay SiliconixAN822\nPowerPAK 1212 DUAL\nTo take the advantage of the dual Powe rPAK 1212-8’s\nthermal performance, the minimum recommendedland pattern can be found in Application Note 826,Recommended Minimum Pad Patterns With Outline\nDrawing Access for Vishay Siliconix MOSFETs . Click\non the PowerPAK 1212-8 dual in  the index of this doc-\nument.\nThe gap between the two drain pads is 10 mils. This\nmatches the spacing of the two drain pads on the Pow-erPAK 1212-8 dual package.\nThis land pattern can be extended to the left, right, and\ntop of the drawn pattern. This extension will serve toincrease the heat dissipation by decreasing the ther-mal resistance from the foot of the PowerPAK to thePC board and therefore to the ambient. Note thatincreasing the drain land area beyond a certain pointwill yield little decrease in  foot-to-board and foot-to-\nambient thermal resistance.

This parameter\nis measured for the device mounted to an infinite heatsink and is therefore a char acterization of the device\nonly, in other words, independent of the properties of theobject to which the device is mounted. Table 1 shows acomparison of the Power PAK 1212-8, PowerPAK SO-8,\nstandard TSSOP-8 and SO-8 equivalent steady stateperformance. \nBy minimizing the junction-to- foot thermal resistance, the\nMOSFET die temperature is very close to the tempera-ture of the PC board. Consider four devices mounted ona PC board with a board temperature of 45 °C (Figure 4)\n. \nSuppose each device is dissipating 2 W. Using the junc-\ntion-to-foot thermal resistance characteristics of thePowerPAK 1212-8 and the other SMT packages, dietemperatures are determined to be 49.8 °C for the Pow-erPAK 1212-8, 85  °C for the standard SO-8, 149  °C for\nstandard TSSOP-8, and 125  °C for TSOP-6. This is a\n4.8 °C rise above the board temperature for the Power-\nPAK 1212-8, and over 40  °C for other SMT packages. A\n4.8 °C rise has minimal effect on r\nDS(ON)  whereas a rise\nof over 40  °C will cause an increase in rDS(ON)  as high\nas 20 %. Spreading Copper\nDesigners add additional copper, spreading copper, to\nthe drain pad to aid in conducting heat from a device. Itis helpful to have some in formation about the thermal\nperformance for a given area of spreading copper. \nFigure 5 and Figure 6 show the thermal resistance of a\nPowerPAK 1212-8 single and  dual devices mounted on\na 2-in. x 2-in., four-layer FR-4 PC boards. The two inter-nal layers and the backside la yer are solid copper. The\ninternal layers were chosen as solid copper to model the\nlarge power and ground planes common in many appli-cations. The top layer was cut back to a smaller area and\nat each step junction-to-ambient thermal resistancemeasurements were taken. The results indicate that anarea above 0.2 to 0.3 square inches of spreading coppergives no additional thermal performance improvement.A subsequent experiment was run where the copper onthe back-side was reduced, first to 50 % in stripes tomimic circuit traces, and then totally removed. No signif-icant effect was observed.TABLE 1: EQIVALENT STEADY STATE PERFORMANCE\nPackage SO-8 TSSOP-8 TSOP-8 PPAK 1212 PPAK SO-8\nConfiguration Single Dual Single Dual Single Dual Single Dual Single Dual\nThermal Resiatance RthJC(C/W) 20 40 52 83 40 90 2.4 5.5 1.8 5.5\nFigure 4.

The PowerPAK 1212-8 combines  small size with attrac-\ntive thermal characteristics.  By minimizing the thermal\nrise above the boa rd temperature, PowerPAK simplifies\nthermal design considerations, allows the device to runcooler, keeps r\nDS(ON)  low, and permits the device to\nhandle more current than a same- or larger-size MOS-FET die in the standard TSSOP-8 or SO-8 packages.Figure 5.
