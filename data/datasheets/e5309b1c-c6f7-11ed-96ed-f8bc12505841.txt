When combined with an external \nreference oscillator and loop filter, the MAX2870 is \na high-performance frequency synthesizer capable \nof synthesizing frequencies from 23.5MHz to 6.0GHz \nwhile maintaining superior phase noise and spurious \nperformance.\nThe ultra-wide frequency range is achieved with the \nhelp of multiple integrated VCOs covering 3000MHz to \n6000MHz, and output dividers ranging from 1 to 128. \nThe device also provides dual differential output drivers, \nwhich can be independently programmable to deliver \n-4dBm to +5dBm output power. Both outputs can be \nmuted by either software or hardware control.\nThe MAX2870 is controlled by a 4-wire serial interface and \nis compatible with 1.8V control logic. The device is available \nin a lead-free, RoHS-compliant, 5mm x 5mm, 32-pin TQFN \npackage, and operates over an extended -40 NC to +85 NC \ntemp erature ran ge.\nApplicationsBenefits and Features\nU Integer and Fractional-N Modes\nU Manual or Automatic VCO Selection\nU 3000MHz to 6000MHz Fundamental VCO\nU Output Binary Buffers/Dividers for Extended \nFrequency Range\n\t• 1/2/4/8/16/32/64/128\n\t• 23.5MHz to 6000MHz\nU High-Performance PFD\n\t• 105MHz in Integer-N Mode\n\t• 50MHz in Fractional-N Mode\nU Reference Frequency Up to 200MHz\nU Operates from +3.0V to +3.6V Supply\nU Dual Programmable Outputs\n\t• -4dBm to +5dBm\nU Analog and Digital Lock Detect Indicators\nU Hardware and Software Shutdown Control\nU Compatible with 1.8V Control Logic\nWireless Infrastructure\nTest and Measurement\nSatellite Communications\nWireless LANs/CATVPMAR/LMAR/Public \nSafety Radio\nClock Generation\nREF_IN\nCLK\nDATA\nLEX2MUX MUX DIVIDE-BY-2 R COUNTER\nINTEGER FRAC\nMAIN\nMODULATORMODULUSVCOSPI AND\nREGISTERS\nDIV-BY-\n1/2/4/8\nMUXDIV-BY-\n1/2/4/8/16\nMUXMUX\nLOCK DETECT\nCHARGE\nPUMPMUX_OUT\nLD\nCP_OUT\nCP_GND\nTUNE\nRFOUTA_P\nRFOUTB_PRFOUT_ENRFOUTA_N\nRFOUTB_N\nN COUNTERMAX2870\n19-6250; Rev 6; 4/17\nVCC_to GND_  ....................................................... -0.3V to +3.9V\nAll Other Pins to GND_  .............................. -0.3V to V CC_ + 0.3V\nContinuous Power Dissipation (T A = +70NC)\n TQFN-EP Multilayer Board\n (derate 34.5mW/ NC above +70 NC) ......................... 2758.6mWJunction Temperature  ..................................................... +150NC\nOperating Temperature Range  .......................... -40NC to +85 NC\nStorage Temperature Range  ............................ -65NC to +150 NC\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s)  ..............................  +300NC\nSoldering temperature (reflow)  ....................................... +260NC\nTQFN  \nJunction-to-Ambient Thermal Resistance ( BJA) .......... 29NC/W Junction-to-Case Thermal Resistance ( BJC) .................. 1.7NC/WAbsolute Maximum Ratings\nNote 1:  Package thermal resistances were obtained using the method described in JEDEC specification JESD51-7, using a four-layer \nboard.

For \nread operation, in addition to the above 3 pins, MUX_\nOUT pin can be used to access Reg, 0x06, refer figure 2.\nThe MAX2870 serial interface contains six write-only and \none read-only 32-bit registers. The 29 most-significant \nbits (MSBs) are data, and the three least-significant bits \n(LSBs) are the register address. Register data is loaded \nMSB first through the 4-wire serial interface (SPI). When LE is logic-low, the logic level at DATA is shifted at the \nrising edge of CLK. At the rising edge of LE, the 29 data \nbits are latched into the register selected by the address \nbits. The user must program all register values after \npower-up.\nUpon power-up, the registers should be programmed \ntwice with at least a 20ms pause between writes. The first \nwrite ensures that the device is enabled, and the second \nwrite starts the VCO selection process. Recommended to \nturn-off the outputs during this sequence and then turn-\non the outputs using RFA_EN, RFB_EN.\nFigure 1. SPI Timing Diagram\nFigure 2.

Several bits are  \ndouble-buffered to update the settings at the same time. \nSee the register descriptions for double-buffered settings.Read Sequence\nRegi ster 0x06 can be read back through MUX_OUT. \nThe user must set MUX = 1100. To begin the read \nsequence, set LE to logic-low, send 32 periods of CLK, \nand set LE to logic-high. While the CLK is running, the \nDATA pin can be held at logic-high or logic-low for 29 \nclocks, but the last 3 bits must be 110 to indicate regis -\nter 6. Then finally, send 1 period of the clock. The MSB \nof register 0x06 appears on the falling edge of the next \nclock and continues to shift out for the next 29 clock \ncycles (Figure 2). After the LSB of register 0x06 has \nbeen  read, the user can reset MUX = 0000.\nPower Modes\nThe MA X2870 can be put into low-power mode by set -\nting SHDN = 1 (register 2, bit 5) or by setting the CE pin \nto logic -low. In low-power mode, all blocks except SPI \nare off.\nAfter exiting low-power mode, allow at least 20ms for \nexternal capacitors to charge to their final values before \nprogramming the final VCO frequency. \nReference Input\nThe reference input stage is configured as a CMOS \ninverter with shunt resistance from input to output. In \nshutdown mode this input is set to high impedance to \nprevent loading of the reference source.\nThe reference input signal path also includes optional x2 \nand ÷2 blocks. When the reference doubler is enabled \n(DBR = 1), the maximum reference input frequency is lim -\nited to 100MHz. When the doubler is disabled, the refer -\nence input frequency is limited to 200MHz. The minimum \nreference frequency is 10MHz. The minimum R counter \ndivide ratio is 1, and the maximum divide ratio is 1023.Figure 3.

RDIV2 (register 2, bit 24)  sets \nthe fREF divide-by-2 mode (0 or 1). R (register 2, \nbits 23:14)  is the value of the 10-bit programmable \nreference counter  (1 to 1023). The maximum f PFD is \n50MHz for frac-N mode and 105MHz for int-N mode. The \nR-divider can be held in reset when RST (register 2, \nbit 3) = 1.\nInt, Frac, Mod, and R Counter  \nRelationship\nThe VCO frequency (f VCO), N, F, and M can be deter -\nmined based on desired RF output frequency (f RFOUTA ) \nas follows:\nSet DIVA value property based on f RFOUTA  and DIVA \nregister table (register 4[22.20])\nfVCO = fRFOUTA  x DIVA\nIf bit FB = 1, (DIVA is not in PLL feedback loop):\nN + (F/M) = f VCO/ fPFD\nIf bit FB = 0, (DIVA is in PLL feedback loop) and DIVA \n≤ 16:\nN + (F/M) = (f VCO/fPFD)/DIVA\nIf bit FB = 0, (DIVA is in PLL feedback loop) and DIVA > 16:\nN + (F/M) = (f VCO / fPFD)/16\nN is the value of the 16-bit N counter (16 to 65535), \nprogrammable through bits 30:15 of register 0. M is the \nfractional modulus value (2 to 4095), programmable \nthrough bits 14:3 of register 1. F is the fractional division \nvalue (0 to MOD - 1), programmable through bits 14:3 of \nregister 0. In frac-N mode, the minimum N value is 19 and \nmaximum N value is 4091. The N counter is held in reset \nwhen RST = 1 (register 2, bit 3). DIVA is the RF output \ndivider setting (0 to 7), programmable through bits 22:20 \nof register 4. The division ratio is set by 2 DIVA.The RF B output frequency is determined as follows:\nIf BDIV = 0 (register 4, bit 9), f RFOUTB  = fRFOUTA .\nIf BD IV = 1, f RFOUTB  = fVCO.\nInt-N/Frac-N Modes\nInteger-N mode is selected by setting bit INT = 1 (regis -\nter 0, bit 31). When operating in integer-N mode, it is also \nnecessary to set bit LDF (register 2, bit 8) to set the lock \ndetect to integer-N mode.\nThe device’s frac-N mode is selected by setting bit INT = 0 \n(register 0, bit 31). Additionally, set bit LDF = 0 (register \n2, bit 8) for frac-N lock-detect mode.\nIf the device is in frac-N mode, it will remain in frac-N \nmode when fractional division value F = 0, which can \nresult in unwanted spurs. To avoid this condition, the \ndevice can automatically switch to integer-N mode when \nF = 0 if the bit F01 = 1 (register 5, bit 24).\nPhase Detector and Charge Pump\nThe device’s charge-pump current is determined by the \nvalue of the resistor from pin RSET to ground and the \nvalue of bits CP (register 2, bits 12:9) as follows:\nICP = 1.63/R SET x (1 + CP)\nTo reduce spurious in frac-N mode, set charge-pump  \nlinearity bit CPL = 1 (register 1, bits 30:29). For int-N \nmode, set CPL = 0. For lower noise operation in int-N \nmode, set charge-pump output clamp bit CPOC = 1  \n(register 1, bit 31) to prevent leakage current onto the \nloop filter. For frac-N mode, set CPOC = 0.\nThe charge-pump output can be put into high-imped -\nance mode when TRI = 1 (register 2, bit 4). The output is \nin normal mode when TRI = 0.\nThe phase detector polarity can be changed if an active \ninverting loop filter topology is used. For noninverting \nloop filters, set PDP = 1 (register 2, bit 6). For inverting \nloop filters, set PDP = 0.\nMAX2870 23.5MHz to 6000MHz Fractional/  \nInteger-N Synthesizer/VCO \nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 14\nTable 2. Int-N Digital Lock-Detect SettingsTable 1. Frac-N Digital Lock-Detect SettingsMUX_OUT and Lock Detect\nMUX_OUT is a multipurpose test output for observing \nvarious internal functions of the MAX2870. MUX_OUT \ncan also be configured as serial data output. Bits MUX  \n(register 2, bit 28:26) are used to select the desired \nMUX_OUT signal (see Table 6 ).\nLock detect can be monitored through the LD output by \nsetting the LD bits (register 5, bits 23:22). For digital lock \ndetect, set LD = 01. The digital lock detect is dependent \non the mode of the synthesizer. In frac-N mode set LDF = \n0, and in int-N mode set LDF = 1. To set the accuracy of \nthe digital lock detect, see Table 1  and Table 2 .\nAnalog lock detect can be set with LD = 10. In this mode, \nLD is an open-drain output and requires an external  \npullup resistor of typical value, 10K Ω.\nThe lock detect output validity is dependent on many \nfactors. The lock detect output is not valid during the \nVCO auto selection process. After the VCO auto selec -\ntion process has completed, the lock detect output is not \nvalid until the TUNE voltage has settled. TUNE voltage \nsettling time is dependent on loop filter bandwidth, and \ncan be calculated using the EE-Sim Simulation tool found \nat www.maximintegrated.com .\nFast-Lock\nThe device uses a fast-lock mode to decrease lock time. \nThis mode requires that CP = 0000 (register 2, bits 12:9) \nand that the shunt resistive portion of the loop filter be \nsegmented into two parts, where one resistor (R2A) is \n1/4th the total resistance, and the other resistor (R2B) is 3/4th the total resistance. The larger resistor should be \nconnected from SW to ground, and the smaller resistor \nfrom SW to the loop filter capacitor. When CDM = 01 \n(register 3, bits 16:15), fast-lock is active after the VAS \nhas completed. During fast-lock, the charge pump is \nincreased to CP = 1111 and the shunt loop filter resis -\ntance is set to 1/4th the total resistance by changing pin \nSW from high impedance to ground. Fast-lock deacti -\nvates after a timeout set by the user. This timeout is loop \nfilter dependent, and is set by:\ntFAST-LOCK  = M x CDIV/f PFD\nwhere M is the modulus setting and CDIV is the clock \ndivider setting. The user must determine the CDIV setting \nbased on their loop filter time constant. The SW pin can \nbe left open/ no connect when fast lock mode is not used.\nFigure 4.

Each differential output can \nbe independently enabled or disabled by setting bits \nRFA_EN (register 4, bit 5) and RFB_EN (register 4, bit 8). \nBoth outputs are also controlled by applying a logic-high \n(enabled) or logic-low (disabled) to pin RFOUT_EN.\nThe output power of each output can be individually \ncontrolled with APWR (register 4, bits 4:3) for RFOUTA \nand BPWR (register 4, bits 7:6) for RFOUTB. The avail -\nable differential output power settings are from -4dBm \nto +5dBm, in 3dB steps with 50 I pullup to supply. The \navailable single-ended output power ranges from -4dBm \nto +5dBm in 3dB steps with a RF choke to supply. Across \nthe entire frequency range different pullup elements (L \nor R) are required for optimal output power. If the output \nis used single ended, the unused output should be termi -\nnated in a corresponding load.\nVoltage-Controlled Oscillator\nThe fun damental VCO frequency of the device guarantees \ngap-free coverage from 3.0GHz to 6.0GHz using four \nindividual VCO core blocks with 16 sub-bands within \neach block. Connect the output of the loop filter to the \nTUNE input. The TUNE input is used to control the VC O.\nTune ADC\nA 3-bit ADC is used to read the VCO tuning voltage. The \nADC value can be read back by bits 22:20 in register 6. \nThe ADC uses the ranges shown in Table 3 .\nNote that the digital or analog lock detect might still be \nvalid when the tuning voltage is out of the compliance \nrange.\nVCO Autoselect (VAS) State Machine\nAn inter nal VCO autoselect state machine is initiated \nwhen register 0 is programmed to automatically select \nthe correct VCO if bit VAS_SHDN = 0 (register 3, bit 25). \nThe state machine clock, f BS, must be set to 50kHz. This \nis set by the BS bits. The formula for setting BS is:\nBS = f PFD/50kHz\nwhere f PFD is the phase-detector frequency. The BS (regis -\nter 4, bits 19:12) value should be rounded to the nearest \ninteger. If the calculated BS is higher than 1023, then set BS = 1023. If f PFD is lower than 50kHz, then set BS = 1. \nThe time needed to select the correct VCO is 10/f BS.\nThe RETUNE (register 3, bit 24) bit is used to enable or \ndisable the VAS auto-retune function. Should the 3-bit \nTUNE ADC detect that the VCO control voltage (V TUNE ) \nhas drifted into the 000 or 111 state, the VAS will initiate \nan auto-retune if RETUNE = 1. If RETUNE = 0, then this \nfunction is disabled.\nIf VAS_SHDN = 1, then the VCO can be manually \nselected by bits VCO (register 3, bits 31:26). Refer to the \nApplications Information  section for detailed implementation \nof VCO manual selection.\nPhase Shift Mode\nAfter ac hieving lock, the phase of the MAX2870 device’s \nRF output can be changed in increments of P/M x 360 N. \nThe absolute phase cannot be determined, but it can be \nchanged relative to the current phase.\nTo change the phase, do the following:\n1) Achieve lock at the desired frequency.\n2) Set the increment of phase relative to the current phase \nby setting P = M x {desired_phase_change}/360 N.\n3) Enable the phase change by setting CDM = 10.\n4) Reset CDM  = 00.\nLow-Spur Mode\nThe device offers three modes for the sigma-delta modu -\nlator. Low-noise mode offers lower in-band noise at the \nexpense of spurs. The spurs can be reduced by setting \nSDN = 10 (register 2, bits 30:29) or SDN = 11 for different \nmodes of dithering. The user can determine which mode \nworks best for their application.\nTable 3.

For best performance, take into consideration \ngrounding and routing of RF, baseband, and power \nsupply PCB proper line. Make connections from vias \nto the ground plane as short as possible. On the high \nimpedance ports, keep traces short to minimize shunt \ncapacitance. EV kit Gerber files can be requested at  \nwww.maximintegrated.com .\nPower-Supply Layout\nTo minimize coupling between different sections of the \nIC, a star power-supply routing configuration with a large \ndecoupling capacitor at a central VCC_ node is recom -\nmended. The VCC_ traces branch out from this node, \neach going to a separate VCC_ node in the circuit. Place \na bypass capacitor as close as possible to each supply \npin This arrangement provides local decoupling at each \nVCC_ pin. Use at least one via per bypass capacitor for \na low-inductance ground connection. Do not share the \ncapacitor ground vias with any other branch.\nRefer to Maxim’s Wireless and RF Application Notes for \nmore information.\nMAX2870 23.5MHz to 6000MHz Fractional/  \nInteger-N Synthesizer/VCO \nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 24PACKAGE \nTYPEPACKAGE \nCODEOUTLINE \nNO.LAND  \nPATTERN NO.\n32 TQFN-EP T3255+5 21-0140 90-0013PART TEMP RANGE PIN-PACKAGE\nMAX2870ETJ+ -40NC to +85 NC 32 TQFN-EP*\nRevision History\nMaxim Integrated cannot assume responsibility for use of any circuitry other than circuitry entirely embodied in a Maxim Integrated product.
