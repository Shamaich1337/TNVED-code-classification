The NCP718\nincorporates EN pin and soft−start feature for simplecontrolling by microprocessor or logic.\nInput Decoupling (C IN)\nIt is recommended to connect at least 1 /C0109F ceramic X5R\nor X7R capacitor between IN and GND pin of the device.\nThis capacitor will provide a low impedance path for anyunwanted AC signals or noise superimposed onto constantinput voltage. The good input capacitor will limit theinfluence of input trace inductances and source resistanceduring sudden load current changes.\nHigher capacitance and lower ESR capacitors will\nimprove the overall line transient response.\nOutput Decoupling (C OUT)\nThe NCP718 does not require a minimum Equivalent\nSeries Resistance (ESR) for the output capacitor. The device\nis designed to be stable with standard ceramics capacitors\nwith values of 1 /C0109F or greater. The X5R and X7R types have\nthe lowest capacitance variations over temperature thus theyare recommended.\nPower Dissipation and Heat Sinking\nThe maximum power dissipation supported by the device\nis dependent upon board design and layout. Mounting pad\nconfiguration on the PCB, the board material, and theambient temperature affect the rate of junction temperature\nrise for the part. For reliable operation junction temperature\nshould be limited to +125 °C.The maximum power dissipation the NCP718 can handle\nis given by:\nPD(MAX)/C0043/C0426TJ(MAX)/C0042TA/C0427\nR/C0113JA(eq. 1)\nThe power dissipated by the NCP718 for given\napplication conditions can be calculated from the following\nequations:\nPD/C0091VIN/C0466IGND(IOUT)/C0467/C0041IOUT/C0466VIN/C0042VOUT/C0467 (eq. 2)\nor\nVIN(MAX)/C0091PD(MAX)/C0041/C0466VOUT/C0032IOUT/C0467\nIOUT/C0041IGND(eq. 3)\nHints\nVIN and GND printed circuit board traces should be as\nwide as possible. When the impedance of these traces ishigh, there is a chance to pick up noise or cause the regulator\nto malfunction. Place external components, especially the\noutput capacitor, as close as possible to the NCP718, and\nmake traces as short as possible .\nADJUSTABLE VERSION\nThe output voltage can be set by using a resistor divider\nas shown in Figure 15 with a range of 1.2 V to 5 V . The\nappropriate resistor divider can be found by solving the\nequation below, while V REF = 1.2 V\nVOUT/C0043VREF/C0064(R1/C0041R2)\nR1/C0043VREF/C0064/C04661/C0041R2\nR1/C0467(eq. 4)\nValue of R1 and R2 is recommended to keep below\n100 k/C0087 for R1 and below 1 M /C0087 for R2 to avoid influence\nof current I ADJ variation over temperature range.\nR21μF\nCeramicNCP718\nADJ versionIN OUT\nGND COUTCINVIN VOUT\n1μF\nCeramic EN\nOFFON R1ADJ\nFigure 15.
