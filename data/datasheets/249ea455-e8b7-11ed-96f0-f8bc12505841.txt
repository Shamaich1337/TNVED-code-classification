Output Ripple and Noise Test Setup\n \n \nDesign Considerations \nInput filtering \nThe power module should be connected to a low ac-\nimpedance input source. Highly inductive source impedances \ncan affect the stability of the power module. For the test \nconfiguration in Figure3 a 47µF\n electrolytic capacitor (ESR< \n0.7\nΩ\n at 5Hz to 20MHz), mounted close to the power module \nhelps ensure stability of the unit.  \n \n \n \nSafety Considerations \nFor safety-agency approval of the system in which the power \nmodule is used, the power module must be installed in \ncompliance with the spacing and separation requirements of \nthe end-use safety agency standard, i.e. CAN/CSA-C22.2, \nNo. 60950-1 and IEC60950-1, and also compliance with \nUL62368-1, CAN/CSA C22.2 No. 62368-1-14, EN62368-1 \nand IEC62368-1, if the system in which the power module is \nto be used must meet safety agency requirements. \n \nFor all input voltages, other t\nhan DC mains, where the input \nvoltage is less than .60V dc, if the input meets all of the \nrequirements for SELV, the output is considered to remain \nwith SELV limits. Signal com\nponent failure and fault tests \nwere performed in the power converters. \n \nIf the input source is non-SELV (ELV or hazardous voltage \ngreater than 60Vdc and less than or equal to75Vdc), for the \nmodule’s output to be considered as meeting the \nrequirements for safety extra-low voltage (SELV), all of the \nfollowing must be true. \n\uf06e\n The input source is to be provided with reinforced \ninsulation from any other hazardous voltage, including \nthe AC mains. \n\uf06e\n One V\nIN \npin and one V\nOUT\n pin are to be grounded, or \nboth the input and output pins are to be kept floating. \n\uf06e\n The input pins of the module are not operator \naccessible. \n\uf06e\n Another SELV reliability test is conducted on the whole \nsystem as required by the safe\nty agencies, to verify that \nunder a single fault, hazardous voltages do not appear \nat the module’s output. \n \nAll flammable materials used in the manufacturing of these \nmodules are rated 94V-0.  \n \nTo preserve maximum flexibility, internal fusing is not \nincluded, however, to achieve maximum safety and system \nprotection, always use an input line fuse. The safety \nagencies require a time delay fuse with a maximum rating of \n25A. Based on the information provided in this data sheet on \ninrush energy and maximum dc input current, the same type \nof fuse with a lower rating can be used. Refer to the fuse \nmanufacturer’s data sheet for further information. \n \nDC-DC Converter, Quarter-Brick\nAMGQ500-48S12DCPX1Z2\n \n \n                                                           R e v .  1 . 0 0                             P a g e  9  o f  2 4\n \nFeature Descriptions \nOutput Characteristics \nThe output trim-up voltage is linearly changed follow with \nchange of input voltage.

Two remote on/off logic are \navailable. Negative logic turns the module on when the REM \npin is at logic low and off when it is at logic high. Positive \nlogic turns the module on during logic high and off during \nlogic low. \n \nTo turn the power module on and off, the user must supply a \nswitch to control the voltage between the REM pin and -Vin \nterminal (see Figure 6). A logic low is V\nREM \n= 0 to 0.8V. \nDuring logic high, the maximum V\nREM\n voltage generated by \nthe power module is 20V.  \nIf not using the remote on/off feature, perform one of the \nfollowing to turn the converter on: \nFor negative logic, short REM pin to -Vin.  \nFor positive logic, leave REM pin open.\n \n  \nFigure7 Remote On/Off Implementation \n \nRemote Sense \nRemote sense minimizes the e\nffects of distribution losses \nby regulating the voltage at the remote sense connections \n(see Figure 7. The voltage between the remote sense pins \nand the output terminals must not exceed the output \nvoltage sense range (\n≤\n5% Vo(nom)). The voltage between \nthe +V\nO\n1 and GND terminals must not exceed the minimum \noutput over voltage protection \nvalue shown in the Electrical \nSpecifications table. This limit includes any increase in \nvoltage due to remote sense compensation and output \nvoltage programming (trim). If \nnot using the remote sense \nfeature to regulate the output at the point of load, then \nconnect +S to +V\nO\n1 and -S to GND.\n \n \nAlthough the output voltage can be increased by both the \nremote sense and by the trim, the maximum increase for \nthe output voltage is not the sum of both. The maximum \nincrease is the larger of either\n the remote sense or the trim. \nThe amount of power delivered by the module is defined as \nthe voltage at the output terminals multiplied by the output \ncurrent. When using remote sense and trim, the output \nvoltage of the module can be increased, at the same time \noutput current would increase the power output of the \nmodule. Care should be taken to ensure that the maximum \noutput power of the module remains at or below the \nmaximum rated power. \n10.8\n11.6\n12.4\n13.2\n14\n36 37 42 48 75\nOutput voltage(V)\nInput voltage(V)\nno load\nhalf load\nfull load\n10.5\n11\n11.5\n12\n12.5\n13\n13.5\n36 37 42 48 75\nOutput voltage(V)\nInput voltage(V)\nno load\nhalf load\nfull load\nDC-DC Converter, Quarter-Brick\nAMGQ500-48S12DCPX1Z2\n             \n \n \n                                                           R e v .  1 . 0 0                             P a g e  1 0  o f  2 4\n \nFigure 8 Circuit Configuration for Remote Sense \n \nOutput Voltage Programming \nOutput voltage trim allows the user to increase or decrease \nthe output voltage set point of a module. This is \naccomplished by connecting an external resistor between the \nTRIM pin and either the +S or -S pins. If not using the trim \nfeature, leave the TRIM pin open. \n \nTo increase the output voltage, refer to Figure 9, a trim \nresistor, R\ntrimup \nis connected between the TRIM and +S. \n\uf028\uf029\n\uf057\n\uf02d\n\uf044\n\uf02d\n\uf044\n\uf044\n\uf02b\n\uf0b4\n\uf03d\nk\nx\nV\nTrimup\nR\nout\n)\n22\n.\n10\n%\n511\n%\n225\n.\n1\n%\n100\n11\n.\n5\n(\ntrimup\nR\n= Required value of trim-up resistor [k\nΩ\n] \n100\n%\n\uf0b4\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf044\nOUT\nV\nOUT\nV\ntrimup\nV\n \nOUT\nV\n  = Nominal value of output voltage [V] \ntrimup\nV\n= Desired (trimmed) output voltage [V]. \n \n \nFigure9.

These values are Adjustable via PMBus, D version. \nPG is asserted when the module\n’s output voltage is above \nthe POWER_GOOD_ON value, and PG is de-asserted if \nany condition such as overtemperature, overcurrent or loss \nof regulation occurs that would \nresult in the output voltage \ngoing below the POWER_GOOD_OFF value.  \n \n+Vo1\n+S\nTRIM\n-S\nGND\n+Vin\nREM\n-Vin\nI\nn\np\nu\nt\n V\no\nl\nt\na\nge\nContact and Distribution \nLosses\nLoad\nDC-DC Converter, Quarter-Brick\nAMGQ500-48S12DCPX1Z2\n                           \n \n \n                                                           R e v .  1 . 0 0                             P a g e  1 1  o f  2 4\n \nThe PG signal, provided on pin C2, is implemented with an \nopen-drain node, pulled up via a 10k\nΩ\n resistor to 3.3V \ninternally. For Positive Logic \nPG (default), the PG signal is \nHI, when PG is asserted, and LO, when the PG is de-\nasserted. For Negative Logic PG, the PG signal is LO, \nwhen PG is asserted, and HI, when the PG is de-asserted.  \n \nThe PMBus command MFR_PGOOD _POLARITY is used \nto set the logic polarity of the signal.  \n \nIf not using the Power Good feature, the pin may be left N/C. \n \nProtection Features \nOver Current Protection \nTo provide protection in an output overload fault condition, \nthe module is equipped with inte\nrnal current limiting circuitry, \nand can endure current limiting continuously. \n \nAt the point of current limit \ninception, the unit enters hiccup \nmode. The unit is configured with the auto-restart function, \nit will remain in the hiccup mode as long as the over current \ncondition exists; it operates normally once the output \ncurrent is reduced back into its specified range. \n \nOutput Over Voltage Protection \nThe output overvoltage protection \nconsists of circuitry that \nmonitors the voltage on the output terminals. When the \noutput voltage exceeds the over\nvoltage protection threshold, \nthe converter will operate in a hiccup mode until the \novervoltage cause is cleared. \n \nOver Temperature Protection \nTo provide protection under certain fault conditions, the \nmodule is equipped with a thermal shutdown circuit. The \nmodule will shutdown when \nthe heatsink temperature \nexceeds OTP set value, but the thermal shutdown is not \nintended as a guarantee that the module will survive when \nthe temperatures beyond its rating. The module will \nautomatically restarts \nafter it cools down. \n \nFigure 11\n \nTref Temperature Measurement Location\n \n \nInput Under Voltage Lockout \nInput under voltage lockout is standard with this converter, \nwhen input voltages below the input under voltage lockout \nlimit, the module operation is disabled. It will only begin to \noperate once the input voltage is raised above the under \nvoltage lockout turn-on threshold. \n \nThermal Considerations \nThe power modules operate in a variety of thermal \nenvironments; however, sufficient cooling should be provided \nto help ensure reliable operation of the unit. \nConsiderations include ambient temperature, airflow, module \npower dissipation, and the need for increased reliability. A \nreduction in the operating te\nmperature of the module will \nresult in an increa\nse in reliability.  \n \nHeat Transfer via Convection \nIncreasing airflow over the module enhances the heat \ntransfer via convection.

Recommended EMC application \n \n \nThrough-Hole Soldering Information \nThe product is intended for through-hole mounting in a PCB. \nWhen SnPb wave soldering is used, the temperature on the \npins is specified to maximum 260 °C for maximum 10 \nseconds while the lead-free solder pot is 270°C max. \n \nMaximum preheat rate of 4°C/s and temperature of max \n150 °C is suggested. Hands soldering care should be taken \nto avoid direct contact betwe\nen the hot soldering iron tip \nand the pins for more than a few seconds in order to \nprevent overheating. \n \nA no-clean (NC) flux is recommended to avoid entrapment \nof cleaning fluids in cavities inside of the DC/DC power \nmodule. The residues may affect\n long time reliability and \nisolation voltage. \n \n \nDigital Feature Descriptions  \nPMBus Interface Capability  \nThe power module is equipped with a digital PMBus \ninterface to allow the module to be configured, and \ncommunicate with system cont\nrollers. Detailed timing and \nelectrical characteristics of the PMBus can be found in the \nPMB Power Management Protocol \nSpecification, Part 1, \nrevision 1.2, available at http://pmbus.org. The power \nmodule supports both the 100kHz and 400kHz bus timing \nrequirements. The power module shall stretch the clock, as \nlong as it does not exceed the maximum clock LO period of \n35ms. The power module w\nill check the Packet Error \nChecking scheme (PEC) byte, if provided by the PMBus \nmaster, and include a PEC byte in all responses to the \nmaster. However, the power module does not require a \nPEC byte from the PMBus master. \n \n \nThe power module supports a subset of the commands in \nthe PMBus 1.2 specification. Most all of the controller \nparameters can be programmed using the PMBus and \nstored as defaults for later use. All commands that require \ndata input or output use the li\nnear format. The exponent of \nthe data words is fixed at a reasonable value for the \ncommand and altering the exponent is not supported. Direct \nformat data input or output is not supported by the power \nmodule. The supported commands are described in greater \ndetail below.  \n \nThe \nPOWER MODULE\n contains non-volatile memory that \nis used to store configuration \nsettings and scale factors. \nThe settings programmed into the device are not \nautomatically saved into this non-volatile memory though. \nThe STORE_DEFAULT_ALL command must be used to \ncommit the current settings to non-volatile memory as \ndevice defaults. The settings that are capable of being \nstored in non-volatile memory are noted in their detailed \ndescriptions.\n \n \nPMBus Addressing  \nThe power module can be addressed through the PMBus \nusing a device address. The module has 64 possible \naddresses (0 to 63 in decimal) which can be set using \nresistors connected from the ADDR0 and ADDR1 pins to \nGND. Note that some of these addresses (0 through 12, 40, \n44, 45, and 55 in decimal) are reserved according to the \nComponent Specifications \nC1 C2 C3 \nC4 C5 \nSMD ceramic capacitor-1uF \nC6 \nSMD ceramic capacitor-0.1uF \nL1 L2 \nMagnetic material-473uH-+-25% \nC9 C10 \nC11 C12 \nHigh dielectric strength surface attached \nsafety capacitor-0.22uF/630V \nC7 \nElectrolytic capacitor-470uF \nC8 \nElectrolytic capacitor-220uF \nDC-DC Converter, Quarter-Brick\nAMGQ500-48S12DCPX1Z2\n \n \n                                                           R e v .  1 . 0 0                             P a g e  1 3  o f  2 4\n \nSMBus specifications and may not be useable. The \naddress is set in the form of two octal (0 to 7) digits, with \neach pin setting one digit. The ADDR1 pin sets the high \norder digit and ADDR0 sets the low order digit. The resistor \nvalues suggested for each digit are shown in Table 4 (1% \ntolerance resistors are recommended). \n \nTable 1 \nDigit \nResistor Value(K\nΩ\n) \n0 \n10 \n1 \n15.4 \n2 \n23.7 \n3 \n36.5 \n4 \n54.9 \n5 \n84.5 \n6 \n130 \n7 \n200 \n \nFigure 14. Circuit showing connection of resistors used \nto set the PMBus address of the module. Bypass \ncapacitors with typical 1000pF value can be used in \nparallel win the address resistors in high EMI \ninterference conditions to improve the precision of \naddress. \n \nThe user must know which I\n2\nC addresses are reserved in a \nsystem for special functions and set the address of the \nmodule to avoid interfering with other system operations. \nBoth 100kHz and 400kHz bus speeds are supported by the \nmodule. Connection for the PMBus interface should follow \nthe High Power DC specifications given in section 3.1.3 in \nthe SMBus specification V2.0 for the 400kHz bus speed or \nthe Low Power DC specifications in section 3.1.2. The \ncomplete SMBus specification is available from the SMBus \nweb site, smbus.org.\n \n \nPMBus Data Format  \nFor commands that set or report any voltage thresholds \nrelated to output voltage (including VOUT_COMMAND, \nVOUT_MARGIN, POWER_GOOD and READ_VOUT), the \nmodule supports the linear data\n format consisting of a two \nbyte value with a 16-bit, unsigned mantissa, and a fixed \nexponent of -12. The format of the two data bytes is shown \nbelow: \n \nThe value of the number is then given by \n \nValue = Mantissa x 2\n-12\n  \nFor commands that set all other thresholds, voltages or \nreport such quantities, the module supports the linear data \nformat consisting of a two byte value with an 11-bit, two’s \ncomplement mantissa and a 5-bit, two’s complement \nexponent. The format of the two data bytes is shown below: \n \nThe value is of the number is then given by  \nValue = Mantissa x 2\nExponent\n \n \nPMBus-Enabled On/Off  \nThe module can also be turned on and off via the PMBus \ninterface. The OPERATION command is used to actually \nturn the module on and off via the PMBus, while the \nON_OFF_CONFIG command configures the combination of \nanalog ON/OFF pin input and PMBus commands needed to \nturn the module on and off. Bit [7] in the OPERATION \ncommand data byte enables the module, with the following \nfunctions: \n \n0: Output is disabled  \n1: Output is enabled  \nThis module uses the lower five bits of the \nON_OFF_CONFIG data byte to set various ON/OFF \noptions as follows: \nBit Position \n4 \n3 \n2 \n1 \n0 \nDC-DC Converter, Quarter-Brick\nAMGQ500-48S12DCPX1Z2\n                           \n \n \n                                                           R e v .  1 . 0 0                             P a g e  1 4  o f  2 4\n \nAccess \nr \nr/w \nr \nr \nr \nFunction \nPU \nCMD \nCPR \nPOL\nCPA \nDefault Value \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n \nPU: Factory set to 1.

The mo\ndule requires On/Off(i) pin to \nbe connected to proper input rail for module to power up. \nThis bit is used together with the CMD and ON bits to \ndetermine startup. \nBit Value \nAction \n1 \nModule requires the analog ON/OFF pin \nto be asserted to start the unit \n \n \nAdjusting Input Undervoltage Lockout  \nThe module allows adjustment of the input under voltage \nlockout and hysteresis. The command VIN_ON allows \nsetting the input voltage turn on threshold, while the \nVIN_OFF command sets the input voltage turn off threshold. \nFor both the VIN_ON and VIN_OFF commands, possible \nvalues range from 32.000 to 46.000V in 0.125V steps. \nVIN_ON must be 2.000V greater than VIN_OFF.  \n \nAdjusting Output Voltage  \nThe power module’s output voltage set point is adjusted \nusing the VOUT_COMMAND. The output voltage setting \nuses the Linear data format, \nwith the 16 bits of the \nVOUT_COMMAND formatted as an unsigned mantissa, \nand a fixed exponent \nof -12(decimal) (read from \nVOUT_MODE).  \nVOUT = Mantissa x 2\n-12\n  \nThe range limits for VOUT_COMMAND are 9.60V to \n13.20V, and the resolution is 0.244mV.  \nThe data associated with VOUT_COMMAND can be stored \nto non-volatile memory using the STORE_DEFAULT_ALL \ncommand. \n \nMeasuring Output Voltage  \nThe module can provide output voltage information using \nthe READ_VOUT command. The command returns two \nbytes of data in the linear format, with the 16 bits of the \nREAD_VOUT formatted as an unsigned mantissa, and a \nfixed exponent of -12 (decimal).  \n \nDuring module manufacture, an offset correction value is \nwritten into the non-volatile memory of the module to null \nerrors in the tolerance and A/D conversion of VOUT.  \n \nMeasuring Input Voltage  \nThe module can provide input voltage information using the \nREAD_VIN command. The command returns two bytes of \ndata in the linear format. The upper five bits [7:3] of the high \ndata byte form the two’s comp\nlement representation of the \nexponent, which is fixed at –3 (decimal). The remaining 11 \nbits are used for two’s complement representation of the \nmantissa, with the 11\nth \nbit fixed at zero si\nnce only positive \nnumbers are valid.  \n \nMeasuring Output Current  \nThe module measures output current by using a current \ntransformer as the current sense element. The module can \nprovide output current information using the READ_IOUT \ncommand. The command returns two bytes of data in the \nlinear format. The upper five bits\n [7:3] of the high data byte \nform the two’s complement representation of the exponent, \nwhich is fixed at –4 (decimal). The remaining 11 bits are \nused for two’s complement representation of the mantissa, \nwith the 11\nth\n \nbit fixed at zero since only positive numbers are \nvalid. Output current readings are blanked below 1.65A. \n \n \nMeasuring Internal Module Temperature  \nThe module can provide temperature information using the \nREAD_TEMPERATURE_1 command. The command \nreturns two bytes of data in the linear format. The upper five \nbits [7:3] of the high data byte form the two’s complement \nDC-DC Converter, Quarter-Brick\nAMGQ500-48S12DCPX1Z2\n                           \n \n \n                                                           R e v .  1 . 0 0                             P a g e  1 5  o f  2 4\n \nrepresentation of the exponent, which is fixed at –2 \n(decimal). The remaining 11 bits are used for two’s \ncomplement representation of the mantissa.  \n \nNote that the module’s temperature sensor is located close \nto the module hot spot TH\n1 \n(see Over Temperature \nProtection section).and is subjected to temperatures higher \nthan the ambient air temperature near the module. The \ntemperature reading will be highly influenced by module \nload and airflow conditions.  \n \nReading Status of the Module  \nThe module supports a number of status information \ncommands implemented in PMBus. However, not all \nfeatures are supported in these commands. A X in the \nFLAG cell indicates the bit is not supported. \n \nSTATUS_WORD: Returns two bytes of information with a \nsummary of the module’s fault/warning conditions.\n \nHigh Byte \nBit Position \nFlag \nDefault Value\n15 \nVOUT fault \n0 \n14 \nIOUT fault or warning \n0 \n13 \nInput Voltage fault \n0 \n12 \nX \n0 \n11 \nPOWER_GOOD#(is \nnegated) \n0 \n10 \nX \n0 \n9 \nX \n0 \n8 \nX \n0 \nLow Byte \nBit Position \nFlag \nDefault Value\n7 \nX \n0 \n6 \nOFF \n0 \n5 \nVOUT Overvoltage \n0 \n4 \nIOUT Overcurrent \n0 \n3 \nVIN Undervoltage \n0 \n2 \nTemperature \n0 \n1 \nCML(Comm, Memory Fault) \n0 \n0 \nX \n0 \n \nSTATUS_VOUT: Returns one byte of information relating to \nthe status of the module’s output voltage related faults. \nBit Position \nFlag \nDefault Value\n7 \nVOUT OV Fault \n0 \n6 \nX \n0 \n5 \nX \n0 \n4 \nX \n0 \n3 \nX \n0 \n2 \nX \n0 \n1 \nX \n0 \n0 \nX \n0 \n \nSTATUS_IOUT: Returns one byte of information relating to \nthe status of the module’s ou\ntput current related faults. \nBit Position\nFlag \nDefault Value\n7 \nIOUT OC Fault \n0 \n6 \nX \n0 \n5 \nIOUT OC Warning \n0 \n4 \nX \n0 \n3 \nX \n0 \n2 \nX \n0 \n1 \nX \n0 \n0 \nX \n0 \n \nSTATUS_INPUT: Returns one byte of information relating to \nthe status of the module’s input voltage related faults. \nBit Position\nFlag \nDefault Value\n7 \nVIN OV Fault \n0 \n6 \nX \n0 \n5 \nX \n0 \n4 \nVIN UV Fault \n0 \n3 \nModule Off(Low VIN) \n0 \n2 \nX \n0 \n1 \nX \n0 \n0 \nX \n0 \n \nSTATUS_TEMPERATURE: Returns one byte of information \nrelating to the status of the module’s temperature related \nfaults. \nBit Position\nFlag \nDefault Value\n7 \nOT Fault \n0 \n6 \nOT Warning \n0 \n5 \nX \n0 \n4 \nX \n0 \n3 \nX \n0 \n2 \nX \n0 \n1 \nX \n0 \n0 \nX \n0 \n \nSTATUS_CML: Returns one byte of information relating to \nthe status of the module’s communication related faults.\n \nBit Position\nFlag \nDefault Value\n7 \nInvalid/Unsupported \nCommand \n0 \n6 \nInvalid /Unsupported Data \n0 \n5 \nPacket Error Check Failed \n0 \n4 \nX \n0 \n3 \nX \n0 \n2 \nX \n0 \n1 \nX \n0 \nDC-DC Converter, Quarter-Brick\nAMGQ500-48S12DCPX1Z2\n \n \n                                              R e v .  1 . 0 0                             P a g e  1 6  o f  2 4\n \n0 \nX \n0 \n \n \n \nSummary of Supported PMBus Commands \nThis section outlines the PMBus command support for the modul\ne bus converters.
