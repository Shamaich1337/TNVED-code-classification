The bits are clocked out on \nthe falling edge of the SCLK input; 12 SCLK cycles are required to access a result from the AD7366, and 14 SCLK \ncycles are required for the AD7367. The data simultaneously appears on both pins from t he simultaneous con -\nversions of both ADCs. The data stream consists of the 12 bits of conversion data for the AD7366 and 14 bits for \nthe AD7367 and is provided MSB first. If CS is held low for a further 14 SCLK cycles, on either DOUTA or DOUTB, the \ndata from the other ADC follows on that DOUT pin. Note, the second serial result from the AD 7366 is preceeded \nby two zeros.

D | Page 14 of 28 TERMINOLOGY \nDifferential Nonlinearity  (DNL)  \nDNL is the difference between the measured and the ideal  \n1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes in the ADC.  \nIntegral Nonlinearity  (INL)  \nINL is the maximum deviation from a straight line passing \nthrough the  endpoints of the ADC transfer function.  The \nendpoints of the transfer function are zero  scale , a point 1 LSB \nbelow the first code transition , and full scale , a point 1 LSB  above \nthe last code transition.  \nZero Code Error  \nThe deviation of the mid scale trans ition (all 1s to all 0s) from \nthe ideal VIN voltage, that is , AGND − ½ LSB for bipolar ranges \nand 2  × VREF − 1 LSB for the unipolar range.   \nPositive Full -Scale Error  \nThe deviation of the last code transition (011…110) to (011…111)  \nfrom the ideal ( that is,  +4 × VREF − 1 LSB or +2 × VREF – 1 LSB) \nafter the zero code error has been factored out.   \nNegative Fu ll-Scale Error  \nThe deviation of the first code transition (10…000) to (10…001)  \nfrom the ideal ( that is, −4 × VREF + 1 LSB, −2 × VREF + 1 LSB, or \nAGND + 1  LSB) after the zero code error  has been factored out.  \nZero Code Error Match  \nThe difference in zero code error across all channels. \nPositive Full -Scale Error Match  \nThe difference in positive full -scale error across all channels.  \nNegative Full -Scale Error Ma tch \nThe difference in negative full -scale error across all channels. \nTrack -and-Hold Acquisition Time  \nThe track -and-hold ampli fier returns to track mode at  the end \nof a conversion. Track -and-hold acquisition time is the time \nrequired for the output of the track -and-hold amplifier to reach \nits final value, within ± ½ LSB, after the end of a conversion.  \nSignal -to-Noise ( + Distortion) Ratio  (SINAD) \nThis ratio is the measured ratio of signal -to-noise (+ dis tortion) \nat the output of the ADC . The signal is the rms amplitude of the \nfundament al. Noise is the sum of all nonfundamental signals up \nto half the sampling frequency (fS/2), excluding dc. The ratio is \ndependent on the number of quantization levels in the digitiza -\ntion process : the more levels, the smaller the quantization n oise. \nThe theoretical signal-to -noise ( + distortion) ratio for an ideal \nN-bit converter with  a sine wave input is as follows: \nSignal- to-Noise (+ Distortion) = (6.02N + 1.76) dB \nThus , for a 12 -bit converter, th e SINAD is 74 dB.  Total Harmonic  Distortion (THD)  \nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of harmonics to the fundamental.  \nFor the AD7366/AD7367, THD  is defined as  follows : \n16 5 4 3 2\nVV V V V VTHD2 2 2 2 2\nlog 20 ) dB(+ + + +=  \nwhere :  \nV1 is the r ms amplitude of the fundamental.  \nV2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 are the rms amplitudes o f the second \nthrough the sixth harmonics.  \nPeak Harmonic or Spurious Noise  \nPeak harmonic , or spurious noise , is the ratio of the rms value \nof the next largest component in the ADC output spectrum  \n(up to fS/2, excluding dc) to the rms value of the fundament al. \nNormally, the value of this specification is determined by the largest harmonic in the spectrum. However, for ADCs where \nthe harmonics are buried in the noise floor, it is  a noise peak.  \nChannel -to-Channel Isolation  \nChannel -to-channel isolation is a me asure of the level of cross-\ntalk between any two channels when operating in any of the input ranges. It is measure d by applying a full -scale, 150  kHz \nsine wave signal to all unselected input channels and determining  \nhow much that signal is attenuated in the selected channel with a 50 kHz signal. The figure given is the typical value across all \nfour channels for the AD7366/AD7367 (see Figure 9 for more \ninformation). \nIntermodulation Distortion  (IMD)  \nWith inputs consisting of sin e waves at two frequencies, fa and \nfb, any active device with nonlinearities create s distortion prod -\nucts at the sum, and differen t frequencies of mfa ± nfb , where \nm, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on.  Intermodulation distortion terms \nare tho se for which neither m  nor n is equal t o zero. For example , \nthe second -order terms include (fa + fb) and (fa − fb), and the \nthird -order terms include (2fa + fb), (2fa − fb), (fa  + 2fb) , and \n(fa − 2fb).  \nThe AD7366/AD7367 are tested using the CCIF standard where \ntwo input frequencies near the top end of the input bandwidth \nare used. In this case, the second -order t erms are usually distanced  \nin frequency from the original sine waves , and the third -order \nterms are usually at a frequency close to the input frequencies. As a result, the second - and third -order terms are specified \nseparately. The calculation of the inter modulation distortion is \nas per the THD specification , where it is the ratio of the rms \nsum of the individual distortion products to the rms amplitude of the sum of the  fundamentals expressed in decibels . \n  AD7366/AD7367 \n \nRev. D | Page 15 of 28 Power Supply Rejection  Ratio (PSRR ) \nVariations in power supply affect the full-scale transition but \nnot the converter’s linearity. PSRR is the  maximum change in  \nthe full- scale transition point due to a change i n power supply \nvoltage from the nominal value (see Figure 11). \nThermal  (or Output Voltage) Hysteresis  \nThermal (or output voltage) hysteresis is defined as the absolute \nmaximum change of reference output voltage after the device is cycled through temperature from either  \nT_HYS+  = +25°C to T\nMAX to +25°C  \nor \nT_HYS − = +25°C to TMIN to +25°C  It is expressed in ppm using the following equation:  \n610) C 25 () _ ( ) C 25 () ppm( ×°− °=\nREFREF REF\nHYSVHYST V VV  \nwhere:  \nVREF(25°C) is VREF at 25°C. \nVREF(T_HYS)  is the maximum change of VREF at T_HYS+  \nor T_HYS −. \n \n \n \n \nAD7366/AD7367   \n \nRev.

The \nAD7366/AD7367 can accept bipolar input ranges of ±10  V  \nand ±5  V.  They  can also accept a unipolar input range  of 0 V to \n10 V . The AD7366/AD7367 require  VDD and VSS dual supplies \nfor the high voltage analog input structure s. These supplies must  \nbe equal to or greater than ± 11.5 V . See Table 7 for the minimum  \nrequirements on these supplies for each analog input range . The \nAD73 66/AD7367 require a low voltage 4.75  V to 5.25 V A VCC \nsupply to power the ADC core.  \nTable 7.

The AD7366/AD7367  \nare available  in a 24 -lead TSSO P,  offering the user considerable \nspace -saving advantages over alternative solutions. The AD7366/  \nAD7367 require a CNVST  signal to start conversion. On the \nfalling edge of CNVST , both track -and-holds are  placed into \nhold mode and the conversions are initiated . The BUSY signal \ngoes  high to indicate that the conversions are taking place. The \nclock source for each suc cessive approximation ADC is provided \nby an interna l oscillator. The BUSY signal go es low to indicate \nthe end of conversion. On the falling edge of BUSY,  the track -\nand-hold return s to track mode. When  the conversion is \nfinished, the serial clock input acc esses data from the part.  \nThe AD7366/AD7367 have an on -chip 2.5 V reference that can \nbe disabled  if an external reference is preferred.  If the internal \nreference is to be used elsewhere in a system, the output from \nDCAPA and  DCAPB must first be buffered. On power -up, the \nREFSEL pin must be tied to either a high or low logic st ate to \nselect either the internal or external reference option . If the \ninternal reference is the preferred option, the user must tie the REFSEL pin logic high. Alternatively, if REFSEL  is tied to GND \nthen an external reference can be supplied to both ADC s \nthrough the D\nCAPA and DCAPB pins.  \nThe analog inputs are configured as two single -ended inputs  \nfor each ADC. The input voltage range can be selected by \nprogramming  the RANGE bits as sh own in  Table 8.  CONVERTER OPERATION  \nThe AD7366/AD7367 have two successive approximation \nADC s, each based around two capacitive DACs.  Figure 16 and \nFigure 17 show simplified sche matics of an ADC  in acquisition \nand conversion phase s. The ADC comprise s control logic, a \nSAR , and a capacitive DAC. In Figure 16 (the acquisition phase ), \nSW2 is closed  and SW1 is in P osition A, the comparator is held \nin a balanc ed condition, and the sampling capacitor arrays \nacquire the signal on the input.  \nVIN\nAGNDA\nBSW1\nSW2\nCOM PARATORCAPACITIVE\nDAC\nCONTROL\nLOGIC\n06703-018 \nFigure 16.

The input bandwidth of \nthe track -and-hold is greater than the Nyquist rate of the ADC. \nThe AD7366/AD7367 can handle frequencies up to 35 MHz.  \nThe track -and-hold enters its  tracking mode when  the BUSY \nsignal goes low after the CS falling edge. The time required to \nacquire an input signal depends on how quickly the sampling \ncapacitor is charged. With zero source impedance, 140  ns is suffi-\ncient  to acquire th e signal to the 12-bit level for the AD7366 and \nthe 14-bit level  for the AD7367. The acquisition time f or the \n±10 V , ±5 V , and 0 V to 10 V ranges to settle to within ±½ LSB \nis typically 140 ns.

D | Page 18 of 28 Unlike other bipolar ADCs,  the AD7366/AD7367 do not have a \nresistive analog input structure. On the AD7366/AD7367 , the \nbipolar analog signal is sampled directly onto the sampling \ncapacitor. This gives t he AD7366/AD7367 high analog input \nimpedance. The analog input impedance can be calculated from the following formula: \nZ = 1/( f\nS × CS) \nwhere : \nfS is the sampling frequency.  \nCS is the sampling capacitor value.  \nCS depends on the analog input range chosen (se e the  Analog \nInputs  section). When operating at 1 MSPS, the analog  input \nimpedance is typically 260  kΩ for the ±10 V range. As the \nsampling frequency is reduced, the analog input impedance further increases. As the analog input impedance increases, the current required to drive the analog input therefore decreases (see Figure 7 for more information) . TYPICAL CONNECTION D IAGRAM  \nFigure 20 shows a typical c onnection diagram for the AD7366/  \nAD7367. In this configuration, the AGND pin is connected  \nto the analog ground plane of the system, and the DGND pin  \nis connected to the digital ground plane of the system. The  \nanalog inputs on the AD7366/ AD7367 accept  bipolar s ingle -\nended signals. The AD7366/AD7367 can operate with either  \nan internal or an external  reference.

D | Page 19 of 28 DRIVER AMPLIFIER CHOICE \nThe AD7366/AD7367 have  a total of four analog inputs, which \noperate in single- ended mode. The analog inputs for both ADCs  \ncan be programmed to one of the three analog input ranges. In \napplications where the signal source is high impedance, it is \nrecommended that the signa l be buffered  before applying it to \nthe ADC analog inputs. Figure  21 shows  the configuration of \nthe AD7366/AD7367 in single -ended mode.  \nIn applications where the THD  and SNR  are critical specifi -\ncations, the analog input of the  AD7366/AD7367 should be \ndriven from a low impedance source. Large source impedances significantly affect the ac performance of the ADC and can necessitate the use of an input buffer amplifier.  \nWhen no amplifier is used to drive the analog input, the sour ce \nimpedance should be limited to low values. The maximum source impedance depends on the amount of THD that can be tolerated in the application. The THD increases as the source impedance \nincreases and performance degrades.  Figure 7 show s THD vs. \nthe analog input frequency for various source impedances. \nDepending on the input range and analog input configuration selected, the AD7366/AD7367 can handl e source impedances as \nillustrated in  Figure 7.  \nDue to th e programmable nature of the analog inputs on the \nAD7366/AD7367, the choice of op amp used to drive the \ninputs is a  function of the particular application and depends \non the analog input voltage range selected.  \nThe driver amplifier must be able to settle for a full -scale step  \nto a 14-bit level, 0.0061 %, in less than the specified acquisition \ntime of the  AD7366/AD7367. An op amp such as the AD8021 \nmeets this requirement when operati ng in single -ended mode. \nThe AD8021 needs an external compensating NPO type of \ncapacitor. The AD8022 can also be used in high frequency \napplications where a dual version is required . For lower fre -\nquency applications, recommended op amps are  the AD797, \nAD845, and AD8610. \nV+\nV–VDD\nVSSVA1 VCC+5V\nAGNDAD8021\n1kΩ\n1kΩ15pF\nCCOMP = 10pF–10V/–5V+10V/+5V\nAD7366/\nAD7367*\n*ADDIT IONAL PINS OMIT TED FOR CL ARITY.10µF\n+0.1µF\n+0.1µF\n+\n+10µF\n+\n06703-023 \nFigure 21. Typical Connection Diagram  with the AD8021 for Driving the \nAnalog Input  VDRIVE  \nThe AD7366/AD7367 also ha ve a VDRIVE  feature  to control  the \nvoltage at which the  serial interface operates. VDRIVE  allows the \nADC to easily interface to both 3 V and 5 V proc essors. For \nexample, if the AD7366/AD7367 were  operated with a VCC of \n5 V,  t h e  VDRIVE pin could be powered from a 3 V supply, allowing \na large dynamic range with low voltage digital processors. Thus , \nthe AD7366/AD7367 c an be used with the ±10 V input range \nwhile still being able to interface to 3 V digital parts.  \nTo achieve the maximum throughput rate of 1.12  MSPS for the \nAD7366 or 1 M SPS for the AD7367, VDRIVE  must be greater than \nor equal to 4.75 V ( see Table 2 and Table 3). The maximum \nthroughput rate with the VDRIVE voltage set to less than  4.75 V \nand greater than 2.7  V is 1 MSPS for the AD7366 and 900 kSPS \nfor the AD7367.   \nREFERENCE  \nThe AD7366/AD7367 can operate with either the internal 2.5 V \non-chip reference or an externally applied reference. The logic \nstate of the REFSEL pin determines whether the internal refer -\nence is used. The internal reference is selected for both ADC s \nwhen the REFSEL pin is tied to logic high. If the REFSEL pin is \ntied to GND , an external reference can be supplied through the \nDCAPA and DCAPB pins.  On power -up, the R EFSEL pin must be \ntied to either a low or high logic state for the par t to operate. \nSuitable reference sources for the AD7366/AD7367 include the \nAD780, AD1582, ADR431, REF193, and ADR391. \nThe internal reference cir cuitry consists of a 2.5 V band gap \nreference and a reference buffer. When operating the AD7366/  \nAD7367 in internal reference mode, the 2.5 V internal reference \nis available at the DCAPA and DCAPB pins, which should be \ndecoupled to AGND using a 680 nF capacitor. It is recom -\nmended that the internal reference be buffered before applying  \nit elsewhere in the system. The internal reference is capable of \nsourcing up to 150 μA  with an  analog input range of ±10 V  \nand 7 0 μA for both the ±5  V and 0  V to 10 V ranges .  \nIf the internal reference operation is required for the ADC con -\nversion, the REFSEL pin must be tied to logic high on power -up. \nThe reference buffer requires 70 µs to power up and charge the \n680 nF decoupling capacitor during the power -up time.  \nThe AD7366/AD7367 are specified for a 2.5 V to 3 V reference. \nWhen a 3  V reference is selected, the analog input rang es are \n±12 V , ±6 V , and 0 V to 12 V . For these ranges , the VDD supply \nmust be greater than or equal to  +12 V and the VSS supply must \nbe less than or equal to  −12 V.  \n \nAD7366/AD7367   \n \nRev. D | Page 20 of 28 MODES OF OPERATION \nThe mode of operat ion of the AD7366/AD7367 is selected by  \nthe logic state of the CNVST  signal at the end of a conver sion. \nThere are two  possible modes of operation: normal mode and \nshutdown mode. These modes  of operation are designed to \nprovide flexible power management options, which can be \nchosen to optimize the power dissipation/throughput rate  \nratio for differing application requirements.  \nNORMAL  MODE  \nNormal  mode is intended for applications that require  fast \nthroughput rates. In normal mode, the AD7366/AD7367 \nremain fully powered at all times, so  the user does not need  to \nworry about power -up times. Figure 22 shows the general mode \nof operation of the AD7366 in normal mode ; Figure 23 shows  \nnormal  mode for the AD7367.  \nThe conversion is initiated on the falling edge of CNVST  as \ndescribed in the Circuit Information section. To ensure that   \nthe part remains fully powered up at all times, CNVST  must  be \nat logic state high before the BUSY signal go es low. If CNVST  is \nat logic state low when the BU SY signal goes low, the analog \ncircuitry power s down and the part cease s converting. The \nBUSY signal remains high for the duration of the conversion.  The CS pin must be brought low to bring the data bus out of \nthree -state. Therefore,  12 SCLK  cycles are required to read the \nconversion result  from the AD7366 and  14 SCLK  cycles are \nrequired to read the  conversion result  from the AD7367. The \nDOUT lines return to three -state only  when CS is brought high. If \nCS is left low for a n additional  12 SCLK cycles for the AD7366 or \n14 SCLK cycles for the AD7367, the result from t he other on -chip  \nADC is also accessed on the same DOUT line, as shown in Figure 27 \nand Figure 28 (see the Serial Interface  section) .  \nWhen  24 SCLK cycles have elapsed for th e AD7366 or 28 SCLK  \ncycles for the AD7367, the DOUT line returns  to three -state only \nwhen CS is brought high, not on the 24th or 28th SCLK falling \nedge. If CS is brought high prior to this, the DOUT line returns to \nthree -state at that point. Thus, CS must be brought high when  \nthe read is completed,  because  the bus does not automatically \nreturn to three -state upon completion of the dual result read.  \nWhen  a data transfer is complete and DOUTA and DOUTB hav e \nreturned to three- state, another conversion can be initiated after \nthe quiet time, tQUIET , has elapsed by bringing CNVST  low again.  \n \nCNVST\nBUSY\nSCLKt2t1\nt3\nSERIAL READ OPERATIONCS\n1 12tCONVERTtQUIET\n06703-024 \nFigure 22.

D | Page 21 of 28 SHUTD OWN MODE  \nShutdown  mode is intended for use in applications where slow \nthroughput rates are required. Shutdown  mode is suited to \nappli cations where a series of conversions performed at a \nrelatively high throughput rate are followed by a long period  \nof inactivity and thus , shutdown. When the AD7366/AD7367 \nare in full power -down, all analog circuitry is powered d own.  \nThe falling edge of  CNVST  initiates the conversion. The BUSY \noutput su bsequently goes high to indicate that the conversion is \nin progress. After  the conversion is completed, the BUSY output \nreturns low. If the  CNVST  signal is at logic low when BUSY \ngoes low , the part enter s shut down at the end of the conver sion \nphase. While the part is in shut down mode , the digital output \ncode from the last conversion on each ADC can still be read \nfrom the DOUT pins. To read the DOUT data, CS must be brought \nlow as described in the Serial Interface  section. The DOUT pins \nreturn to three -state when CS is brought back to logic high.  \nTo exit full power -down and to power  up the AD7366/AD7367, \na rising e dge of CNVST  is required. After the required pow er-up \ntime has elapsed, CNVST  can be brought low again to initiate \nanother conversion, as shown in Figure 24 (see th e Power -Up \nTimes  section fo r power -up times associated with the AD7366/  \nAD7367). POWER -UP T IMES  \nThe AD7366/AD7367 have one power -down mode, which is \ndescribed in detail  in the Shutdown Mode  section . This section \ndeals with the power -up time requir ed when comi ng out of \nshutdown  mode . It should be n oted that the power -up time s (as \nexplained in this section ) apply  with the recommended capaci -\ntors in place on the DCAPA and DCAPB pins . To power up f rom \nshutdown, CNVST  must be brought high and remain high for a \nminimum of 70  μs, as shown in Figure 24. \nWhen power supplies are first applied to the AD7366/AD7367, the ADC can  power up with CNVST\n in either the low or high \nlogic state. Before attempting a valid conversion , CNVST  must \nbe brought high and remain high for the recommended power -\nup time of 70 μs. Then CNVST  can be brought low to initiate a \nconversion. With the AD7366 /AD7367, no dummy conversion \nis required before valid data can be read from th e DOUT pins.  \nTo place the part in shutdown mode when the supplies are first \napplied, the AD7366/AD7367 must be powered up  and a \nconversion initiated . However,  CNVST  should remain in the \nlogic low state so that when the BUSY signal goes l ow, the part \nenters shutdown.  \nWhen  supplies are applied to the AD7366/AD7367, sufficient  \ntime must be allowed for any external reference to power up and \nto charge the various  reference buffer decoupling capacitors to \ntheir final values .\n \nBUSY\nSCLKSERIAL READ OPERATIONCS\n1 12tCONVERT\nt3t2ENTERS SHUTDOWNtPOWER-UP\n06703-026CNVST\n \nFigure 24.

On the \nfalling edge of  CNVST , the AD7366/AD7367 simultaneously \nconvert  the selected channels. These conversions are performed  \nusing the on -chip oscillator. After the falling edge of CNVST , \nthe BUSY signal goes high, indicating th at the conver sion has \nstarted. The BUSY signal  returns  low when the conversion has \nbeen completed. The data can now be read from the DOUT pins.  \nThe CS and SCLK signals are required to transfer data from the \nAD7366/AD7367. The AD7366/AD7367 have two ou tput pins \ncorrespo nding to each ADC. Data can be read from the AD7366/ \nAD7367 using both DOUTA and DOUTB. Alternatively , a single \noutput pin of the user’s  choice can be used. The SCLK input \nsignal provides the clock source for the serial interface. The CS \ngoes low to access data from the AD7366/AD7367. The falling \nedge of CS takes the bus out of three -state and clocks out the \nMSB of the conversion result. The data stream consists of \n12 bits of data for the AD736 6 and 14 b its of data for the \nAD7367, MSB first. The first bit of the conversion result is  \nvalid on the first SCLK falling edge after the CS falling edge. \nThe subsequent 1 1/13 bits of data for the AD7366/AD7367, \nrespectively , are clocked out on th e falling edge of the SCLK \nsignal. A minimum of 1 2 clock p ulses must be provided to the \nAD7366 to access each conversi on result, and  a minimum of \n14 clock p ulses must be provided to the AD7367 to access the \nconversion result. Figur e 25 shows how a 12 SCLK read is used \nto access the conversion results for the AD7366, and  Figure 26 \nillustrates the case for the AD7367 with a 14 SCLK read. On the rising edge of CS the conversion is terminate d and \nDOUTA and DOUTB return to three -state. If CS is not brought \nhigh, but is instead held low for an additional 14 SCLK cycles the data from the other DOUT pin follows on the selected DOUT pin. Note, the second serial result from the AD 7366 is \npreceeded by two zeros.  See \nFigure 27 and Figure 28, where \nDOUTA is shown. In this case, the DOUT line in use returns to \nthree -state on the rising edge of CS. \nIf the falling e dge of SCLK coincides with the falling edge of CS, \nthe falling edge of SCLK is not acknowledged by the AD7366/ \nAD7367, and the next falling edge of SCLK is the first one \nregistered after the falling edge of CS. \nThe CS pin can be brought low be fore the BUSY signal goes \nlow, indic ating the end of a conversion. When  CS is at a logic \nlow state , the data bus is brought out o f three -state . This feature \ncan be u sed to ensure that the MSB is va lid on the falling edge \nof BUSY by bring ing CS low a minimum of t4 before  the BUSY \nsignal goes low. The dotted CS line in Figure 22 and Figure 23 \nillustrates this  feature. \nAlternatively, the CS pin can be tied to a low logic state continu -\nously. In this case, the DOUT pins never enter three- state and  the \ndata bus is continuously active. Under these conditions,  the MSB \nof the conversion result for the AD7366/AD7367 is available on \nthe falling edge of the BUSY signal. The next most significant \nbit is available on the first SCLK falling edge after the BUSY \nsignal has gone low. This mode of operation enables the user to \nread the MSB as soon as it is made a vailable by the converter.  \nDOUTA\nDOUTBTHREE-\nSTATETHREE-STATECS\nSCLK 1 5 12 2 3 4\nDB10\nDB11DB9 DB8 DB2 DB1 DB0t5 t6t8\nt4t7t9\n06703-027 \nFigure 25.

The CS input allows easy interfacing betw een \nthe TMS320VC5506 and the AD7366/AD7367 without any glue \nlogic required. The serial ports of the TMS320VC5506 are set \nup to operate  in burst mode with internal CLKX0 (T x serial \nclock on Serial Port  0) and FSX0 (T x frame sync from Serial \nPort 0).

Set the word length to 16 by setting Bit WL1 = 1  \nand Bit WL0 = 0 in the CRA  register. The FSP bit in the CRB \nregister should be set to 1 so that  the frame sync is negative.  \nAD7366/AD7367   \n \nRev.

The VDRIVE  pin of the AD7366/AD7367 takes the same \nsupply voltage as the po wer supply pin of the DSP563xx.

D | Page 27 of 28 APPLICATION HINTS  \nLAYOUT AND GROUNDING   \nThe printed circ uit board that houses the AD7366/AD7367 \nshould be designed so that the analog and digital sections are \nconfined to  separate  areas of the board. This design facilitates the \nuse of ground planes that can be easily se parated.  \nTo provide optimum shielding for ground planes, a minimum \netch technique is generally the best option . All AGND pins on \nthe AD7366/AD7367 should be connected to the AGND plane. \nDigital and analog ground pins should be joined in only one place. If  the AD7366/AD7367 are in a system where multiple \ndevices require an AGND and DGND connection, the connec -\ntion should still be made at only  one poin t. A star point should \nbe established as close as possible to the ground pins on the AD7366/AD7367.  \nGood co nnections should be made to the power and ground \nplanes. This can be done with a single via or multiple vias for \neach supply and ground pin.  \nAvoid running digital lines under the AD7366/AD7367 device s \nbecause this couples noise onto the die. However, the analog ground plane should be allowed to run under the AD7366/  \nAD7367 to avoid noise coupling. The power supply lines to  \nthe AD7366/AD7367 should use as large a trace as possible to \nprovide low impedance paths and reduce the effects of glitches \non the pow er supply line.  To avoid radiating noise to other sections of the board, com -\nponents with fast switching signals, such as clocks, should be \nshielded with digital ground and should never be run near the \nanalog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals. To reduce the effects of feedthrough within the board, traces should \nbe run at right angles to each other. A microstrip technique is the best method, but its use may not be possible with a double -\nsided board. In the microstrip technique , the compo nent side of \nthe board is dedicated to ground planes, and signals are placed on the other side.  \nGood decoupling is also important. All analog supplies should be decoupled with 10 µF tantalum capacitors in parallel with 0.1 µF capacitors to AGND. To achieve  the best results from \nthese decoupling components, they must be placed as close as \npossible to the device, ideally right  up against the device. The \n0.1 µF capacitors should have a low effective series resistance \n(ESR) and low effective series inductance ( ESI), such as is typical \nof common ceramic and surface mount types of capacitors. These \nlow ESR, low ESI capacitors provide a low impedance path to ground at high frequencies to handle transient currents due to internal logic switching.  \n \nAD7366/AD7367   \n \nRev.
