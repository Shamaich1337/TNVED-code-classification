The\nMCP41XXX is a single-channel  device and is offered in\nan 8-pin PDIP or SOIC package. The MCP42XXX con-\ntains two independent channels in a 14-pin PDIP, SOIC\nor TSSOP package. The wiper position of the\nMCP41XXX/42XXX varies linear ly and is co ntrolled via\nan industry-standard SPI interface. The devices con-\nsume <1 µA during static operation. A software shut-\ndown feature is provided that disconnects the “A”terminal from the resistor stack and simultaneously con-\nnects the wiper to the “B” te rminal. In addition, the dual\nMCP42XXX has a SHDN\n pin that performs the same\nfunction in hardware. During shutdown mode, the con-\ntents of the wiper register can be changed and the\npotentiometer returns from shutdown to the new value.The wiper is reset to the mid-scale position (80h) upon\npower-up. The RS\n (reset) pin implements a hardware\nreset and also returns th e wiper to mid-scale. The\nMCP42XXX SPI interface incl udes both the SI and SO\npins, allowing daisy-chaining of multiple devices. Chan-\nnel-to-channel resistance matching on the MCP42XXXvaries by less than 1%. These devices operate from a\nsingle 2.7 - 5.5V supply and are specified over the\nextended and industrial temperature ranges.\nPackage Types \n16-Bit\nShiftVDD\nVSS\nSI\nSCKRS SHDN\nPB1\nPA1\nPW1Resistor\n Array 1 * Wiper \nRegisterPB0\nPW0PA0Resistor\n Array 0 Wiper \nRegister\nRegister\nS0Control\n Logic\nCS\n*Potentiometer P1 is only available on the dual\nMCP42XXX version.MCP42XXX1\n2\n3\n4 11121314\n8910 5\n6\n7PDIP/SOIC/TSSOP\nPB1\nPA1PW1SHDNSO\nRS\nPW0PB0CS\nPA0SCK\nSI\nVSSVDD\nMCP41XXX1\n2\n3\n4 5678PDIP/SOIC\nPB0\nPA0VDD\nPW0\nVSS\nCS\nSCK\nSISingle/Dual Digital Potentiometer with SPI™ Interface\n\nMCP41XXX/42XXX\nDS11195C-page 2 \uf8e9 2003 Microchip Technology Inc.1.0 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nDC CHARACTERISTICS: 10 k Ω VERSION\nElectrical Characteristics:  Unless otherwise indicated, VDD = +2.7V to 5.5V, TA = -40°C to +85°C (TSSOP devices are only specified at +25°C and \n+85°C).

Resistance val-\nues of 10 k Ω, 50 k Ω and 100 k Ω are available. As\nshown in Figure 4-1, each potentiometer is made up ofa variable resistor and an 8-bit (256 position) data reg-\nister that determines the wip er position. There is a\nnominal wiper resistance of 52 Ω for the 10 k Ω version,\n125Ω for the 50 k Ω and 100 k Ω versions. For the dual\ndevices, the channel-to-channel matching variation isless than 1%. The resistance between the wiper and\neither of the resistor endpoints varies linearly according\nto the value stored in the data register. Code 00heffectively connects the wi per to the B terminal. Atpower-up, all data registers will automatically be loaded\nwith the mid-scale value (80h). The serial interface pro-vides the means for loading data into the shift register,\nwhich is then transferred to  the data registers. The\nserial interface also provides the means to place indi-vidual potentiometers in th e shutdown mode for maxi-\nmum power savings. The SHDN\n pin can also be used\nto put all potentiometers in shutdown mode and the RS\npin is provided to set all potentiometers to mid-scale\n(80h).\nFIGURE 4-1: Block diagram showing the MCP42XXX dual di gital potentiometer. Da ta register 0 and \ndata register 1 are 8-bit registers allowing 256 posit ions for each wiper. Standard SPI pins are used with \nthe addition of the Shutdown (SHDN ) and Reset (RS ) pins. As shown, reset affects the data register and \nwipers, bringing them to mid-scale. Shutdown disconnects the A terminal and connects the wiper to B, \nwithout changing the state of the data registers.\nWhen laying out the circuit for your digital potentiome-\nter, bypass capacitors should be used. These capaci-\ntors should be placed as close as possible to the devicepin. A bypass capacitor va lue of 0.1 µF is recom-\nmended. Digital and analog traces should be separatedas much as possible on the board, with no traces run-ning underneath the device or the bypass capacitor.\nExtra precautions should be taken to keep traces with\nhigh-frequency signals (such as clock lines) as far as\npossible from analog traces . Use of an analog ground\nplane is recommended in order to keep the groundpotential the same for all devices on the board.RDAC1\nSCK\nSO SIDecode\nLogic\n16-bit Shift RegisterPA0 PB0PW0\nRDAC2\nData Register 1\nCSRS\nSHDND7 D0Data Register 0\nD7 D0 D7 D0PA1 PB1PW1\nVDD\nAB\nWVDD\nMCP4XXXXµC\nTo Application\nCircuit0.1 uF\n0.1 uF\nData Lines\n\nMCP41XXX/42XXX\nDS11195C-page 14 \uf8e9 2003 Microchip Technology Inc.4.1 Modes of Operation\nDigital potentiometer applications can be divided into\ntwo categories: rheostat mode and potentiometer, or\nvoltage divider, mode.\n4.1.1 RHEOSTAT MODE\nIn the rheostat mode, the pot entiometer is used as a\ntwo-terminal resistive element. The unused terminalshould be tied to the wiper, as shown in Figure 4-2.Note that reversing the polarity of the A and B terminals\nwill not affect operation.\n \nFIGURE 4-2: Two-terminal or rheostat \nconfiguration for the digital potentiometer. Acting \nas a resistive element in the circuit, resistance is controlled by changing the wiper setting.\nUsing the device in this mode allows control of the total\nresistance between the two nodes. The total measured\nresistance would be the least at code 00h, where the\nwiper is tied to the B terminal. The resistance at this\ncode is equal to the wiper resistance, typically 52 Ω for\nthe 10 k Ω MCP4X010 devices, 125 Ω for the 50 k Ω\n(MCP4X050), and 100 k Ω (MCP4X100) devices. For\nthe 10 k Ω device, the LSB size would be 39.0625 Ω\n(assuming 10 k Ω total resistance). The resistance\nwould then increase with this LSB size until the totalmeasured resistance at code FFh would be 9985.94 Ω.\nThe wiper will never directly connect to the A terminal\nof the resistor stack.\nIn the 00h state, the total resistance is the wiper resis-\ntance. To avoid damage to the internal wiper circuitry inthis configuration, care should be taken to ensure the\ncurrent flow never exceeds 1 mA.\nFor dual devices, the variation of channel-to-channel\nmatching of the total resistance from A to B is less than1%. The device-to-device matching, however, can vary\nup to 30%. In the rheostat mode, the resistance has a\npositive temperature coefficient. The change in wiper-to-end terminal resistance over temperature is shown\nin Figure 2-8. The most variation over temperature will\noccur in the first 6% of codes (code 00h to 0Fh) due to\nthe wiper resistance coefficient affecting the total resis-\ntance. The remaining codes are dominated by the totalresistance tempco R\nAB, typically 800 ppm/°C.4.1.2 POTENTIOMETER MODE\nIn the potentiometer mode, all three terminals of the\ndevice are tied to different nodes in the circuit. Thisallows the potentiometer to  output a voltage propor-\ntional to the input voltage. This mode is sometimes\ncalled voltage divider mode.  The potentiometer is used\nto provide a variable voltage by adjusting the wiperposition between the two endpoints as shown in\nFigure 4-3. Note that reversing the polarity of the A andB terminals will not affect operation.\nFIGURE 4-3: Three terminal or voltage \ndivider mode.\nIn this configuration, the ratio of the internal resistance\ndefines the temperature coefficient of the device. The\nresistor matching of the RWB resistor to the RAB resistor\nperforms with a typical te mperature coefficient of\n1 ppm/°C (measured at code 80h). At lower codes, thewiper resistance temperature coefficient will dominate.Figure 2-3 shows the effect of the wiper. Above the\nlower codes, this figure shows that 70% of the states\nwill typically have a temperature coefficient of less than5 ppm/°C. 30% of the stat es will typically have a\nppm/°C of less than 1.A\nBW\nMCP4XXXX ResistorA\nBW\nMCP4XXXXV1\nV2\n\n\uf8e9 2003 Microchip Technology Inc. DS11195C-page 15MCP41XXX/42XXX\n4.2 Typical Applications\n4.2.1 PROGRAMMABL E SINGLE-ENDED \nAMPLIFIERS\nPotentiometers are often used to adjust system refer-\nence levels or gain. Programmable gain circuits using\ndigital potentiometers can be realized in a number of\ndifferent ways. An example of a single-supply, inverting\ngain amplifier is shown in Figure 4-4. Due to the high\ninput impedance of the amplifier, the wiper resistanceis not included in the transfe r function. For a single-sup-\nply, non-inverting gain configuration, the circuit inFigure 4-5 can be used. \n.\nFIGURE 4-4: Single-supply, \nprogrammable, inverting gain amplifier using a \ndigital potentiometer.\nFIGURE 4-5: Single-supply, \nprogrammable, non-inverting gain amplifier.In order for these circuits to work properly, care must be\ntaken in a few areas. For linear operation, the analoginput and output signals must be in the range of V\nSS to\nVDD for the potentiometer and input and output rails of\nthe op-amp. The circuit in Figure 4-4 requires a virtualground or reference input to the non-inverting input of\nthe amplifier. Refer to Application Note 682, “Using\nSingle-Supply Operational Amplifiers in EmbeddedSystems” (DS00682),  for more details. At power-up or\nreset (RS)\n, the resistance is set to mid-scale, with RA\nand RB matching. Based on the transfer function for the\ncircuit, the gain is -1 V/V. As the code is increased and\nthe wiper moves towards the A terminal, the gainincreases. Conversely, when the wiper is moved\ntowards the B terminal, the gain decreases. Figure 4-6\nshows this relationship. No tice the pseudo-logarithmic\ngain around decimal code 128. As the wiper\napproaches either terminal, the step size in the gain\ncalculation increases dramatically. Due to the\nmismatched ratio of R\nA and RB at the extreme high and\nlow codes, small increments in wiper position candramatically affect the gain. As shown in Figure 4-3,recommended gains lie between 0.1 and 10 V/V.\nFIGURE 4-6: Gain vs. Code for inverting \nand differential amplifier circuits.\n4.2.2 PROGRAMMABLE DIFFERENTIAL \nAMPLIFIER\nAn example of a differential input amplifier using digital\npotentiometers is shown in Figure 4-7. For the transferfunction to hold, both pots must be programmed to the\nsame code. The resistor-matching from channel-to-\nchannel within a dual device can be used as an advan-tage in this circuit. This circuit will also show stable\noperation over temperature due to the low potentiome-\nter temperature coefficient. Figure 4-6 also shows therelationship between gain and code for this circuit. As\nthe wiper approaches either terminal, the step size in\nthe gain calculation increases  dramatically. This circuit\nis recommended for gains between 0.1 and 10 V/V.MCP606VIN\nVSS-IN\n+INVOUTB A\nWMCP41010\nWhere:VREF+-VDD\nVOUTVINRB\nRA-------\uf8ed\uf8f8\uf8eb\uf8f6VREF1RB\nRA-------+\uf8ed\uf8f8\uf8eb\uf8f6+ –=\nRARAB256 Dn– ()\n256---------------------------------------= RBRABDn\n256------------------=\nRABTotal Resistance of pot=\nDnWiper setting forDn0 to 255= =\nMCP606VIN \nVSSVDD\n+IN\n-INVOUT\nRB RAW\nMCP41010+\n-\nWhere:\nRARAB256 Dn– ()\n256---------------------------------------= RBRABDn\n256------------------=\nRABTotal Resistance of pot=\nDnWiper setting forDn0 to 255= =VOUTVIN1RB\nRA-------+\uf8ed\uf8f8\uf8eb\uf8f6=0.1110\n0 64 128 192 256\nDecimal code (0-255)Absolute Gain (V/V)\n\nMCP41XXX/42XXX\nDS11195C-page 16 \uf8e9 2003 Microchip Technology Inc.FIGURE 4-7: Single Supply \nprogrammable differential amplifier using digital \npotentiometers.\n4.2.3 PROGRAMMABL E OFFSET TRIM\nFor applications requiring only a programmable voltage\nreference, the circuit in Figure 4-8 can be used. This\ncircuit shows the device used in the potentiometer\nmode along with two resistors and a buffered output.This creates a circuit with a linear relationship between\nvoltage-out and programmed code. Resistors R\n1 and\nR2 can be used to increase or decrease the output volt-\nage step size. The potentiometer in this mode is stableover temperature. The oper ation of this circuit over\ntemperature is shown in Figure 2-3. The worst perfor-\nmance over temperature will occur at the lower codesdue to the dominating wiper resistance. R\n1 and R2 can\nalso be used to affect the boundary voltages, thereby\neliminating the use of these lower codes.\n \nFIGURE 4-8: By changing the values of \nR1 and R2, the voltage output resolution of this \nprogrammable voltage reference circuit is \naffected.4.3 Calculating Resistances\nWhen programming the digital potentiometer settings,\nthe following equations can be used to calculate the\nresistances. Programming code 00h effectively bringsthe wiper to the B terminal, leaving only the wiper resis-\ntance.

DS11195C-page 17MCP41XXX/42XXX\n5.0 SERIAL INTERFACE\nCommunications from the controller to the\nMCP41XXX/42XXX digital pote ntiometers is accom-\nplished using the SPI serial interface. This interface\nallows three commands:\n1. Write a new value to the potentiometer data\nregister(s).\n2. Cause a channel to enter low power shutdown\nmode.\n3.NOP (No Operation) command.\nExecuting any command is accomplished by setting\nCS low and then clocking-in a command byte followed\nby a data byte into the 16-bit shift register. The com-mand is executed when CS\n is raised. Data is clocked-\nin on the rising edge of clock and out the SO pin on the\nfalling edge of the clock (see Figure 5-1). The device\nwill track the number of clocks (rising edges) while CS\nis low and will abort all commands if the number of\nclocks is not a multiple of 16.\n5.1 Command Byte\nThe first byte sent is always the command byte, fol-lowed by the data byte. The command byte contains\ntwo command select bits and two potentiometer selectbits. Unused bits are ‘don’t care’ bits. The command\nselect bits are summarized in Figure 5-2. The com-\nmand select bits C1 and C0 (bits 4:5) of the command\nbyte determine which command will be executed. If the\ncommand bits are both 0’s or 1’s, then a NOP com-\nmand will be executed once all 16 bits have been\nloaded. This command is useful when using the daisy-\nchain configuration. When the command bits are 0,1, a\nwrite command will be execut ed with the 8 bits sent in\nthe data byte. The data will be written to the potentiom-\neter(s) determined by the potentiometer select bits. If\nthe command bits are 1,0, then a shutdown command\nwill be executed on the potentiometers determined by\nthe potentiometer select bits. \nFor the MCP42XXX devices, the potentiometer select\nbits P1 and P0 (bits 0:1)  determine which potentiome-\nters are to be acted upon by the command. A corre-\nsponding ‘ 1’ in the position signifies that the command\nfor that potentiometer will get executed, while a ‘0’ sig-\nnifies that the command will not effect that\npotentiometer (see Figure 5-2). \n5.2 Writing Data Into Data Registers\nWhen new data is written into one or more of the poten-tiometer data registers, t he write command is followed\nby the data byte for the new value. The commandselect bits C1, C0 are set to 0,1. The potentiometer\nselection bits P1 and P0 allow new values to be written\nto potentiometer 0, potentiometer 1 (or both) with a sin-\ngle command. A ‘ 1’ for either P1 or P0 will cause the\ndata to be written to the respective data register and a\n‘0’ for P1 or P0 will cause no change. See Figure 5-2\nfor the command format summary.5.3 Using The Shutdown Command\nThe shutdown command allows the user to put the\napplication circuit into a power-saving mode. In this\nmode, the A terminal is open-circuited and the B and Wterminals are shorted toget her. The command select\nbits C1, C0 are set to 1,0. The potentiometer selection\nbits P1 and P0 allow each potentiometer to be shut-\ndown independently. If either P1 or P0 are high, the\nrespective potentiometer will enter shutdown mode. A‘0’ for P1 or P0 will have no effect. The eight data bits\nfollowing the command byte still need to be transmittedfor the shutdown command, but  they are ‘don’t care’\nbits. See Figure 5-2 for command format summary.\nOnce a particular potentiometer has entered the shut-\ndown mode, it will remain in this mode until:\n• A new value is written to the potentiometer data \nregister, provided that the SHDN\n pin is high. The \ndevice will remain in the shutdown mode until the \nrising edge of the CS  is detected, at which time \nthe device will come out of shutdown mode and \nthe new value will be written to the data regis-\nter(s). If the SHDN  pin is low when the new value \nis received, the registers will still be set to the new \nvalue, but the device will remain in shutdown \nmode. This scenario assumes that a valid com-mand was received. If an invalid command was \nreceived, the command will be ignored and the \ndevice will remain in the shutdown mode.\nIt is also possible to use the hardware shutdown pinand reset pin to remove a device from software shut-\ndown. To do this, a low pulse on the chip select line\nmust first be sent. For multip le devices, sharing a single\nSHDN\n or RESET  line allows you to pick an individual\ndevice on that chain to remove from software shutdownmode. See Figure 1-3 for timing. With a preceding chipselect pulse, either of these situations will also remove\na device from software shutdown:\n• A falling edge is seen on the RS\n pin and held low \nfor at least 150 ns, provided that the SHDN  pin is \nhigh. If the SHDN  pin is low, the registers will still \nbe set to mid-scale, but the device will remain in \nshutdown mode. This condition assumes that CS  \nis high, as bringing the RS  pin low while CS  is low \nis an invalid state and results are indeterminate.\n• A rising edge on the SHDN  pin is seen after being \nlow for at least 100 ns, provided that the CS  pin is \nhigh. Toggling the SHDN  pin low while CS  is low \nis an invalid state and results are indeterminate.\n• The device is powered-down and back up.\nNote: The hardware SHDN  pin will always put\nthe device in shutdown regardless of\nwhether a potentiometer has already been\nput in the shutdown mode using thesoftware command.\n\nMCP41XXX/42XXX\nDS11195C-page 18 \uf8e9 2003 Microchip Technology Inc.FIGURE 5-1: Timing Diagram for Writing Instructions  or Data to a Dig ital Potentiometer.\nFIGURE 5-2: Command Byte Format.SO‡SISCKCS†\n23456789 1 01\nNew Register Data \nD7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 P1* P011 12 13 14 15 16\nX C1C0 XX XChannel\nSelect \nBitsData Registers are\nloaded on rising edge of CS.

DS11195C-page 19MCP41XXX/42XXX\n5.4 Daisy-Chain Configuration\nMultiple MCP42XXX devices can be connected in a\ndaisy-chain configuration, as shown in Figure 5-4, by\nconnecting the SO pin from one  device to the SI pin on\nthe next device. The data on the SO pin is the output of\nthe 16-bit shift register. The daisy-chain configuration\nallows the system designer  to communicate with sev-\neral devices without using a separate CS  line for each\ndevice. The example shows a daisy-chain configura-\ntion with three devices, although any number of\ndevices (with or without the same resistor values) can\nbe configured this way. While it is not possible to use aMCP41XXX at the beginning or  middle of a daisy-chain\n(because it does not provide the serial data out (SO)pin), it is possible to use the device at the end of a\nchain. As shown in the timing diagram in Figure 5-3,\ndata will be clocked-out of the SO pin on the falling\nedge of the clock. The SO pin has a CMOS push-pull\noutput and will drive low when CS\n goes high. SO will\nnot go to a high-impedance state when CS  is held high.\nWhen using the daisy-chain configuration, the maxi-mum clock speed possible is reduced to ~5.8 MHz,because of the propagation delay of the data coming\nout of the SO pin. When using the daisy-chain c onfiguration, keep in mind\nthat the shift register of each device is automatically\nloaded with zeros whenever a command is executed(CS\n = high). Because of this, the first 16 bits that come\nout of the SO pin once the CS  line goes low will always\nbe zeros. This means that when the first command isbeing loaded into a device, it will always shift a NOP\ncommand into the next device on the chain becausethe command bits (and all the other bits) will be zeros.\nThis feature makes it nece ssary only to send command\nand data bytes to the device farthest down the chain\nthat needs a new command. For example, if there were\nthree devices on the chain and it was desired to send acommand to the device in the middle, only 32 bytes of\ndata need to be transmitted. The last device on the\nchain will have a NOP loaded from the previous device\nso no registers will be affected when the CS\n pin is\nraised to execute the command. The user must\nalways ensure that multiples of 16 clocks arealways provided (while CS\n is low), as all commands\nwill abort if the number of clocks provided is not amultiple of 16. \nFIGURE 5-3: Timing Diagram for Daisy-Chain Configuration.SO SISCKCSData Registers for all\ndevices are loaded\non Rising Edge of CS\n23456789 1 01\nD PP111213141516\nX C XX X\nFirst 16 bits shifted outC DDDDDDD\nwill always be zeros23456789 1 01\nD PP111213141516\nX C XX X\nCommand and Data for Device 3C DDDDDDD\nstart shifting out after the first 16 clocks\nD PP XCX XXC D D D D D D D23456789 1 01\nD PP111213141516\nX C XX X C DDDDDDD\nD PP XCX XX C DDDDDDDCommand Byte\nfor Device 3Data Byte\nfor Device 1Command Byte\nfor Device 1Command Byte\nfor Device 2Data Byte\nfor Device 2Data Byte\nfor Device 3\nCommand and Data for Device 2\nstart shifting out after the first 32 clocks\n† There must always be multiples of 16 clocks while CS  is low or commands will abort.\n‡ The serial data out pin (SO) is only available on the MCP42XXX device.\n\nMCP41XXX/42XXX\nDS11195C-page 20 \uf8e9 2003 Microchip Technology Inc.FIGURE 5-4: Daisy-Chain Configuration.Microcontroller\nSOCS\nSCK\nSI\nSOCS\nSCK\nSI\n CS\nSCK\nSICS\nSCK\nSO\nDevice 1\nDevice 2\nDevice 3*If you want to load the following \ncommand/data into each part \nin the chain.\nDevice 1\nXX10XX11Device 2\nXX01XX10 Device 3\nXX10XX00EXAMPLE:\nStart by setting CS  low and \nclocking in the command and data that will end up in Device \n3 (16 clocks).cAfter 16 clocks, Device 2 and\nDevice 3 will both have allzeros clocked in from the\nprevious part’s shift register.\nClock-In the command and \ndata for Device 2 (16 more \nclocks).

DS11195C-page 21MCP41XXX/42XXX\n5.5 Reset (RS ) Pin Operation\nThe Reset pin (RS ) will automatically set all potentiom-\neter data latches to mid-scale (Code 80h) when pulled\nlow (provided that the pin is held low at least 150 nsand CS\n is high). The reset will execute regardless of\nthe position of the SCK, SHDN  and SI pins. It is possi-\nble to toggle RS  low and back high while SHDN  is low.\nIn this case, the potentiometer registers will reset tomid-scale, but the potentiometer will remain inshutdown mode until the SHDN\n pin is raised.\n5.6 Shutdown (SHDN ) Pin Operation\nWhen held low, the shutdown pin causes the applica-tion circuit to go into a power-saving mode by open-cir-cuiting the A terminal and shorting the B and W\nterminals for all potentiometers. Data register contents\nare not affected by entering shutdown mode (i.e., whenthe SHDN\n pin is raised, the dat a register contents are\nthe same as before the shutdown mode was entered). \nWhile in shutdown mode, it is still possible to clock in\nnew values for the data registers, as well as togglingthe RS\n pin to cause all data registers to go to mid-scale.\nThe new values will take affect when the SHDN  pin is\nraised. \nIf the device is powered-up with the SHDN  pin held low,\nit will power-up in the shut down mode with the data reg-\nisters set to mid-scale.\n5.7 Power-up Considerations\nWhen the device is powered on, the data registers will\nbe set to mid-scale (80h). A power-on reset circuit is\nutilized to ensure that the device powers up in thisknown state.Note: Bringing the RS  pin low while the CS  pin is\nlow constitutes an invalid operating stateand will result in indeterminate resultswhen RS\n and/or CS  are brought high.\nNote: Bringing the SHDN  pin low while the CS\npin is low constitutes an invalid operatingstate and will result in indeterminate\nresults when SHDN\n and/or CS  are brought\nhigh.TABLE 5-1: TRUTH TABLE FOR LOGIC \nINPUTS\nSCK CS RS SHDN Action\nX Ø H H Communication is initiated with \ndevice.
