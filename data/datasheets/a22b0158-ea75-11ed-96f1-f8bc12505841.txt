If 0.254mm (10 mil) thick alumina thin film substrates must be used,  the die should be raised 0.150mm (6 mils) so that the surface of the die is coplanar with the surface of the substrate.  One way to accomplish this is to attach the 0.102mm (4 mil) thick die to a 0.150mm (6 mil) thick molybdenum heat spreader (moly-tab) which is then attached to the ground plane (Figure 2).\nMicrostrip substrates should be brought as close to the die as possible in order \nto minimize ribbon bond length.  Typical die-to-substrate spacing is 0.076mm (3 mils). Gold ribbon of 0.075 mm (3 mil) width and minimal length <0.31 mm (<12 mils) is recommended to minimize inductance on  RF, LO & IF ports. \nAn RF bypass capacitor should be used on the \nvdd \ninput. A 100 pF single layer \ncapacitor (mounted eutectically or by conductive epoxy) placed no further than \n0.762mm (30 Mils) from the chip is recommended.\nHandling Precautions\nFollow these precautions to avoid permanent damage.\nStorage:  All bare die are placed in either Waffle or Gel based ESD protective \ncontainers, and then sealed in an ESD protective bag for shipment. Once the \nsealed ESD protective bag has been opened, all die should be stored in a dry nitrogen environment.\nCleanliness:  Handle the chips in a clean environment. DO \nnOT \nattempt to clean \nthe chip using liquid cleaning systems.Storage:  All bare die are placed in either Waffle or Gel based ESD protective \ncontainers, and then sealed in an ESD protective bag for shipment.  Once the \nsealed ESD protective bag has been opened, all die should be stored in a dry nitrogen environment.\nStatic Sensitivity:  Follow ESD precautions to protect against > ± 250\nv \nESD \nstrikes.Transients:  Suppress instrument and bias supply transients while bias is applied. Use shielded signal and bias cables to minimize \ninductive pick-up.General Handling:  Handle the chip along the edges with a vacuum collet or with a sharp pair of bent tweezers. The surface of the \nchip may have fragile air bridges and should not be touched with vacuum collet, tweezers, or fingers.\nMounting\nThe chip is back-metallized and can be die mounted with AuSn eutectic preforms or with electrically conductive epoxy.  The \nmounting surface should be clean and flat.\nEutectic Die Attach:  A 80/20 gold tin preform is recommended with a work surface temperature of 255 deg. c \nand a tool \ntemperature of 265 deg. c.  \nWhen hot 90/10 nitrogen/hydrogen gas is applied, tool tip temperature should be 290 deg. c. D\nO nOT \ne\nxpose the chip to a temperature greater than 320 deg. c \nfor more than 20 seconds.  no m\nore than 3 seconds of scrubbing should \nbe required for attachment.Epoxy Die Attach:  Apply a minimum amount of epoxy to the mounting surface so that a thin epoxy fillet is observed around the \nperimeter of the chip once it is placed into position.  \ncur\ne epoxy per the manufacturer’s schedule.\nWire Bonding\nBall or wedge bond with 0.025mm (1 mil) diameter pure gold wire.  Thermosonic wirebonding with a nominal stage temperature of \n150 deg. c \nand a ball bonding force of 40 to 50 grams or wedge bonding force of 18 to 22 grams is recommended.  Use the minimum \nlevel of ultrasonic energy to achieve reliable wirebonds. Wirebonds should be started on the chip and terminated on the package or substrate.
