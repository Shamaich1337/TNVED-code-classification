- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - VCC (Power Supply): 4.75 V to 5.25 V
  - PECL Input Voltage: 0 to 6 V
  - Maximum VCC: 7 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - TTL Output Current: 24 mA
  - VBB Sink/Source Current: ±0.5 mA
  - Power Supply Current (ICCH): 20 to 29 mA
  - Power Supply Current (ICCL): 22 to 32 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Typical power consumption is around 20-32 mA depending on the configuration.

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +85 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - Available in SOIC-8 and TSSOP-8 packages.

- **Special Features:**
  - 3.5 ns typical propagation delay.
  - Flow-through pinouts for easy PCB layout.
  - Default LOW output when inputs are left open or below 1.3 V.
  - Pb-Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free, and RoHS compliant.

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (JEDEC J-STD-020E):**
  - SOIC-8: Level 1
  - TSSOP-8: Level 3

### Typical Applications:
The MC10ELT21 is commonly used in high-speed data communication systems where signal integrity and speed are paramount. Typical applications include:

- **Data Transmission:** Converting PECL signals to TTL levels for compatibility with TTL logic circuits.
- **Clock Distribution:** Used in clock distribution networks where low propagation delay is essential.
- **Signal Processing:** Ideal for applications requiring fast signal processing with minimal power consumption.
- **High-Speed Interfaces:** Suitable for interfacing between different logic families in high-speed digital systems.

This component is particularly valuable in telecommunications, networking equipment, and high-performance computing applications where efficient signal translation is required.
