Introduction\nIntroduction Following the immensel y successful first-generation Cyclone® device \nfamily, Altera® Cyclone II FPGAs extend th e low-cost FPGA density \nrange to 68,416 logic elements (LEs ) and provide up to 622 usable I/O \npins and up to 1.1 Mbits of embedd ed memory. Cyclone II FPGAs are \nmanufactured on 300-mm wafers using TSMC's 90-nm low-k dielectric \nprocess to ensure rapid availability and low cost. By minimizing silicon \narea, Cyclone II devices can support complex digital systems on a single chip at a cost that rivals that of ASICs. Unlike other FPGA vendors who \ncompromise power consumption and pe rformance for low-cost, Altera’s \nlatest generation of low-cost FPGA s—Cyclone II FPGAs,  offer 60% higher \nperformance and half the power consumption of competing 90-nm \nFPGAs. The low cost and optimized feature set of Cyclone II FPGAs make \nthem ideal solutions for a wide array of automotive, consumer, \ncommunications, video processing, test and measurement, and other \nend-market solutions. Reference designs, system diagrams, and IP , found \nat www.altera.com , are available to help you rapidly develop complete \nend-market solutions using Cyclone II FPGAs.\nLow-Cost Embedded Processing Solutions\nCyclone II devices support the Nios II embedded processor which allows \nyou to implement custom-fit embedded processing solutions.  Cyclone II \ndevices can also expand the peripheral  set, memory, I/O, or performance \nof embedded processors.  Single or multiple Nios II embedded processors can be designed into a Cyclone II  device to provide additional \nco-processing power or even replace existing embedded processors in \nyour system.  Using Cyclone II and Nios II together allow for low-cost, high-performance embedded processi ng solutions, which allow you to \nextend your product's life cycle and improve time to market over \nstandard product solutions.\nLow-Cost DSP Solutions\nUse Cyclone II FPGAs alone or as DSP co-processors to improve \nprice-to-performance ratios for digital signal processing (DSP) \napplications.

Refer to the Cyclone II section in the Automotive-Grade \nDevice Handbook . \nAltera Corporation 1–7\nFebruary 2008 Cyclone II Device Handbook, Volume 1Introduction\nVertical migration means that yo u can migrate to devices whose \ndedicated pins, configur ation pins, and power pins are the same for a \ngiven package across device densities.\n1 When moving from one density to a larger density, I/O pins are \noften lost because of the greater number of power and ground \npins required to support the addi tional logic within the larger \ndevice. For I/O pin migration across densities, you must cross \nreference the available I/O pins us ing the device pin-outs for all \nplanned densities of a given pack age type to identify which I/O \npins are migratable.\nTo ensure that your board layout supports migratable densities within \none package offering, enable the ap plicable vertical migration path \nwithin the Quartus II software (go to Assignments menu, then Device, \nthen click the Migration Devices  button). After compilation, check the \ninformation messages for a full list of  I/O, DQ, LVDS, and other pins that \nare not available because of the selected migration path.
