This input allows the user to select the maximum amount of time that the \nADM1232 allows the STROBE  input to remain inactive—that is, STROBE  is not receiving any  \nhigh-to-low transitions—without forcing the ADM1232 to generate a RESET pulse.  \nSee the  section, , and the Specifications Figure 8 STROBE  Timeout Selection section. \n6 3 TOLERANCE Tolerance Input.

C | Page 6 of 12  CIRCUIT INFORMATION \nPB RESET  STROBE  TIMEOUT SELECTION \nThe PB RESET  input makes it possible to manually reset a \nsystem using either a standard push-button switch or a logic \nlow input. An internal debounce circuit provides glitch \nimmunity when used with a switch, reducing the effects of \nglitches on the line. The debounce circuit is guaranteed to cause \nthe ADM1232 to assert a reset if PB RESET  is brought low for \nmore than 20 ms and is guaranteed to ignore low inputs of less \nthan 1 ms. TD (time delay) set is used to set the strobe timeout period. The \nstrobe timeout period is the maximum time between high-to-\nlow transitions that STROBE  accepts before a reset is asserted \n(see ). The strobe timeout settings are listed in .

PB RESET  \nThe TOLERANCE input is used to determine the level at which \nVCC can vary below 5 V without the ADM1232 asserting a reset. \nConnecting TOLERANCE to GND selects a −5% tolerance level and causes the ADM1232 to generate a reset if V\nCC falls below \n4.75 V . If TOLERANCE is connected to V CC, a −10% tolerance \nlevel is selected, which causes the ADM1232 to generate a reset \nif V CC falls below 4.5 V . See the parameters for the V CC trip point \nin the Specifications  section for more information. \nRESET AND RESET  OUTPUTS \nRESET is capable of sourcing and sinking current, whereas \nRESET  is an open-drain MOSFET that sinks current only. \nTherefore, it is necessary to pull this output high. \n \n \n  ADM1232\n \nRev.
