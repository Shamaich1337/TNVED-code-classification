It contains a band gap temperature reference  \nand a 13 -bit ADC to monitor an d digitize the temper ature to a \n0.0625°C  resolution. The ADC resolution, by default, is set to \n13 bits (0.0625°C). This can be changed to 16 bits (0.0078°C) by \nsettin g Bit 7 in the configuration register (Register Address 0x03).  \nThe ADT7410 is guaranteed to operate over supply voltages from \n2.7 V to 5.5 V . Operating at 3.3 V , the average supply current is t ypi-\ncally 210 μA. The ADT7410 has a shutdown mode that powers \ndown the device and offers a shutdown current of typically 2 μA. \nThe ADT7410 is rated for operation over the −55°C to +150°C \ntemperature range.  \nPin A0 and Pin A1 are available for address selection, giving the \nADT7410 four possible I2C addre sses. The CT pin is an open-\ndrain output that becomes active when the temperature exceeds \na progr ammable critical temperature limit. The default critical \ntemperature limit is 147°C. The INT pin is also an open -drain \noutput that becomes active when the temperature exceeds a \nprogrammable limit. The INT and CT pins can operate in either \ncomparator or int errupt mode.  \n \n \n \n    \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM  \nTEMPERATURE\nVALUE\nREGISTER\nCONFIGURATION\nREGISTER\nTHYST\nREGISTERTLOW\nREGISTERTHIGH\nREGISTERTCRIT\nREGISTER\nPOINTER\nREGISTERINTERNAL\nREFERENCE8\n7TEMPERATURE\nSENSORTHIGHTCRIT\nTLOWINTERNAL\nOSCILLATOR\nFILTER\nLOGICΣ-Δ\nMODULATORVDD\nGND6\n5CT\nINT\n3\n4A0\nA11\n2SCL\nSDAI2C INTERFACEADT7410\n06560-001 \nFigure 1.  \n \nADT7410 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

C | Page 9 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nCIRCUIT INFORMATION \nThe ADT7410 is a 13-bit digital temperature sensor that \nis extendable to 16 bits for greater resolution. An on-board \ntemperature sensor generates a voltage proportional to absolute temperature, which is compared to an internal voltage reference and input to a precision digital modulator.  \nThe on-board temperature sensor has excellent accuracy  \nand linearity over the entire rated temperature range without \nneeding correction or calibration by the user. \nThe sensor output is digitized by a Σ-Δ modulator, also known as \nthe charge balance type analog-to-digital converter. This type of converter uses time domain oversampling and a high accuracy comparator to deliver 16 bits of resolution in an extremely \ncompact circuit. \nConfiguration register functions consist of \n\uf0b7 Switching between 13-bit and 16-bit resolution \n\uf0b7 Switching between normal operation and full power-down \n\uf0b7 Switching between comparator and interrupt event modes \non the INT and CT pins \n\uf0b7 Setting the active polarity of the CT and INT pins \n\uf0b7 Setting the number of faults that activate CT and INT \n\uf0b7 Enabling the standard one-shot mode and 1 SPS mode \nCONVERTER DETAILS \nThe Σ-Δ modulator consists of an input sampler, a summing \nnetwork, an integrator, a comparator, and a 1-bit DAC. This \narchitecture creates a negative feedback loop and minimizes the \nintegrator output by changing the duty cycle of the comparator output in response to input voltage changes. The comparator samples the output of the integrator at a much higher rate than the input sampling frequency. This oversampling spreads the \nquantization noise over a much wider band than that of the \ninput signal, improving overall noise performance and \nincreasing accuracy. \nThe modulated output of the comparator is encoded using \na circuit technique that results in I\n2C temperature data.  \nΣ-∆ MODULATOR\nINTEGRATOR\nCOMPARATOR\nTEMPERATURE\nVALUE\nREGISTERCLOCK\nGENERATORLPF DIGITAL\nFILTER1-BIT\nDACVOLTAGE REF\nAND VPTAT\n1-BIT\n13-BIT\n06560-012 \nFigure 12. Σ-Δ Modulator TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT \nIn normal mode, the ADT7410  runs an automatic conversion \nsequence. During this automatic conversion sequence, a conversion takes 240 ms to complete and the ADT7410  is continuously \nconverting. This means that as soon as one temperature conversion \nis completed, another temperature conversion begins. Each \ntemperature conversion result is stored in the temperature value registers and is available through the I\n2C interface. In continuous \nconversion mode, the read operation provides the most recent \nconverted result. \nOn power-up, the first conversion is a fast conversion, taking \ntypically 6 ms. If the temperature exceeds 147°C, the CT pin asserts low. If the temperature exceeds 64°C, the INT pin asserts low. Fast conversion temperature accuracy is typically within ±5°C. \nThe conversion clock for the part is generated internally. No \nexternal clock is required except when reading from and \nwriting to the serial port. \nThe measured temperature value is compared with a critical \ntemperature limit (stored in the 16-bit T\nCRIT setpoint read/write \nregister), a high temperature limit (stored in the 16-bit T HIGH set-\npoint read/write register), and a low temperature limit (stored in \nthe 16-bit T LOW setpoint read/write register). If the measured value \nexceeds these limits, the INT pin is activated; and if it exceeds the \nTCRIT limit, the CT pin is activated. The INT and CT pins are \nprogrammable for polarity via the configuration register, and the INT and CT pins are also programmable for interrupt mode via \nthe configuration register.  \n      \n \n      \n \n   \nADT7410 Data Sheet \n \nRev. C | Page 10 of 24 ONE -SHOT MODE  \nWhen one -shot mode is enabled, the ADT7410  immediately \ncompletes a conversion and then goes into shutdown mode. The \none-shot mode is useful when one of the circuit design priorities  is \nto reduce power consumption.  \nTo enable one- shot mode, set Bits[6:5] of the configuration \nregister (Registe r Address 0x03) to 01.  \nAfter writing to the operation mode bits, w ait at least 240 ms \nbefore reading back the temperature from the temperature value \nregister. This delay ensures that the ADT7410  has adequate time \nto power up and complete a conversion.  \nTo obtain an updated temperature conversion, reset Bits[6:5] of  the \nconfiguration register (Register Address 0x03) to 01.  \n1 SPS MODE  \nIn this mode, the part performs one measurement per second. A conversion takes only 60 ms, and it remains in the idle state \nfor the remaining 940 ms period.

C | Page 11 of 24 SHUTDOWN  \nThe ADT7410 can be placed in shutdown mode by writing 1 \nto Bit 6 and 1 to Bit 5 of the configuration register (Register \nAddress 0x03), in which case the entire IC is shut down and \nno further conversions are initiated until the ADT7410 is \ntaken  out of shutdown mode. The ADT7410 can be taken \nout of shutdown mode by writing 0  to Bit 6 and 0 to Bit 5 in the \nconfiguration register (Register Address 0x 03). The ADT7410 \ntypically takes 1 ms (with a 0.1 µF decoupling capacitor) to come out of shutdown mode. The conversion result from the last conversion prior to shutdown can still be read from t he \nADT7410 even when it is in shutdown mode. When the part is \ntaken out of shutdown mode, the internal clock is started and a \nconversion is initiated.  \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n     \n \n   FAULT QUEUE \nBit 0 and Bit 1 of the configuration register (Register Address \n0x03) are used to set up a fault q ueue. The queue can facilitate up \nto four fault events to prevent false tripping of the INT and CT pins \nwhen the  ADT7410 is used in a noisy temperature environment. \nThe number of faults set in the queue must occur consecutively to set the INT and CT outputs. For example, if the number of faults set in the queue is four, then four consecutive temperature conversi ons must occur with each result exceeding a tempera ture \nlimit in any of the limit registe rs before the INT and CT pins are \nactivated. If two consecutive temperature conversions exceed a  \ntemperature limit and the third conversion does not, the faul t \ncount is reset back to zero.  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n     \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n    \nADT7410 Data Sheet \n \nRev. C | Page 12 of 24 TEMPERATURE DATA FOR MAT  \nOne LSB of the ADC corresponds to 0.0625°C in 13- bit mode. \nThe ADC can theoretically measure a temperature range of \n255°C, but the ADT7410 is guaranteed to measure a low value \ntemperature limit of −55°C to a high value temperature limit \nof +150°C. The temperature measurement result is stored in \nthe 16-bit temperature value re gister and is compared with the \nhigh temperature limits stored in the T CRIT setpoint register and \nthe T HIGH setpoint register. It is also compared with the low \ntemperature limit stored in the T LOW setpoint register.  \nTemperature data in the temperature valu e register, the T CRIT \nsetpoint register, the T HIGH setpoint register, and the T LOW \nsetpoint register are represented by  a 13-bit twos complement \nword. The MSB is the temperature sign bit. The three LSBs, Bit  0 \nto Bit 2, on power -up, are not part of the tem perature conver -\nsion result and are flag bits for T CRIT, T HIGH, and T LOW. Table 5 \nshows the 13 -bit temperature data format without Bit 0 to Bit 2.  \nThe number of bits in the temperature data -word can be ext ended \nto 16 bits, twos complement, by setting Bit 7 to 1 in the conf i-\nguration register (Register Address 0x03). When using a 16 -bit \ntemperature data value, Bit 0 to Bit 2 are not used as flag bits \nand are, instead, the LSB bits of the temperature value. The \npower -on default setting has a 13 -bit temperature data value.  \nReading back the temperature from the temperature value register  \nrequires a 2 -byte read. Designers that use a 9 -bit temperature \ndata format can still use the ADT7410 by ignoring the last four \nLSBs of the 13 -bit temperature value. These four LSBs are Bit 6 \nto Bit 3 in Table 5. \nTable 5. 13 -Bit Temperature Data Format  \nTemperature  Digital Out put \n(Binary) Bits[15:3]  Digital Output (Hex) \n−55°C  1 1100 1001 0000 0x1C90 \n−50 °C 1 1100 1110 0000  0x1CE0  \n−25 °C 1 1110 0111 0000 0x1E70 \n−0.0625°C  1 1111 1111 1111 0x1FFF \n0°C 0 0000 0000 0000 0x000 \n+0.0625°C  0 0000 0000 0001 0x001 \n+25 °C 0 0001 1001 0000 0x190 \n+50 °C 0 0011 0010 0000 0x320 \n+125°C  0 0111 1101 0000 0x7D0 \n+150°C  0 1001 0110 0000 0x960 \n TEMPERATURE CONVERSION FORMULAS  \n16- Bit Temperature Data Format  \nPositive Temperature = ADC Code (dec)/128  \nNegative Temperature = (ADC Code (dec) − 65,536)/128 \nwhere ADC Code  uses all 16 bits of the data byte, including the \nsign bit.  \nNegative Temperature = (ADC Code (dec) − 32,768)/128 \nwhere Bit 15 (sign bit) is removed from the ADC code.  \n13- Bit Temperature Data Format  \nPositive Temperature = ADC Code  (dec)/16  \nNegative Temperature = (ADC Code (dec) − 8192)/16 \nwhere ADC Code  uses the first 13 MSBs of the data byte, \nincluding the sign bit.  \nNegative Temperature = (ADC Code (dec) − 4096)/16 \nwhere Bit 15 (sign bit) is removed from the ADC code.  \n10- Bit Temperature Data Format  \nPositive Temperature = ADC Code (dec)/2  \nNegative Temperature = (ADC Code (dec) − 1024)/2 \nwhere ADC Code  uses all 10 bits of the data byte, including the \nsign bit.  \nNegative Temperature = (ADC Code (dec) − 512)/2 \nwhere Bit 9 (sign bit) is removed from the ADC code.  \n9-Bit Temperature Data Format  \nPositive Temperature = ADC Code (dec)  \nNegative Temperature = ADC Code (dec) − 512 \nwhere ADC Code  uses all nine bits of the data byte, including \nthe sign bit.  \nNegative Temperature = ADC Code (dec ) − 256  \nwhere Bit 8 (sign bit) is removed from the ADC code.  \n \nData Sheet ADT7410 \n \nRev.

Typical I2C Interface Connection  \n \nControl of the ADT7410 is carried out via the I2C-compatible \nserial interface. The ADT7410 is connected to this bus as a slave \nand is under the con trol of a master device.  \nFigure 14 shows a typical I2C interface connection.  \nSERIAL BUS ADDRESS  \nLike all I2C-compatible devices, the ADT7410 has a 7 -bit serial \naddress. The five MSBs of this address for the ADT7410 are set \nto 10010. Pin A1 and Pin A0 set the two LSBs. These pins can \nbe configured t wo ways, low and high, to give four different \naddress options. Table 20 shows the different bus address opt ions \navailable. The recommended pull -up resistor value on the SDA \nand SCL lines is 10 kΩ . \nTable 20. I2C Bus Address Options \nBinary  \nHex  A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 \n1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0x48 \n1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0x49 \n1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0x4A  \n1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0x4B  \nThe serial bus protocol operates as follows: \n1. The master initiates data transfer by establishing a start \ncondition, defined as a high -to-low transition on the serial \ndata line, SDA, while the serial clock line, SCL, remains \nhigh. This indicates that an address/data stream is going \nto follow. All slave per ipherals connected to the serial bus \nrespond to the start condition and shift in the next eight bits, consisting of a 7 -bit address (MSB first) plus a read/ \nwrite (R/\nW) bit. The R/ W bit determines whether data is \nwritten  to, or read from, the slave device.  \n \n \n     2. The peripheral with the address corresponding to the \ntransmitted address responds by pulling the data line low during the low period before the ninth clock pulse, known as the acknowledge bit. All other devices on the bus then \nremain idle while the selected device waits for data to be \nread from or written to it. If the R/\nW bit is a 0, the master \nwrites to the slave device. If the R/ W bit is a 1, the master \nreads from the slave device.  \n3. Data is sent over the serial bus in sequences of nine clock \npulses, eight bits of data followed by an acknowledge bit from the receiver of data. Transitions on the data line must occur during the low period of the clock signal and remain \nstable dur ing the high period as a low -to-high transition when \nthe clock is high, which can be interpreted as a stop signal.  \n4. When all data bytes have been read or written, stop conditions  \nare established. In write mode, the master pulls the data line high during the  10\nth clock pulse to assert a stop \ncondition. In read mode, the master device pulls the data \nline high during the low period before the ninth clock \npulse. This is known as a no acknowledge. The master \ntakes the data line low during the low period before th e \n10th clock pulse, then high during the 10th clock pulse to \nassert a stop condition.  \nIt is not possible to mix read and write in one operation because the type of operation is determined at the beginning and cannot \nsubsequently be changed without starting  a new operation.   \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \nADT7410 Data Sheet \n \nRev. C | Page 18 of 24 WRITING DATA  \nIt is possible to write either a single byte of data or two bytes to \nthe ADT7410, depending on which registers are to be written.  \nWriting a single by te of data requires the serial bus address, the \ndata register address written to the address pointer register, \nfollowed by the data byte written to the selected data register. \nThis is shown in Figure 15.  \nFor the T HIGH setpoint , T LOW setpoint , and T CRIT setpoint  \nregisters, it is possible to write to both the MSB and the LSB registers in the same write transaction. Writing two bytes of \ndata to these registers requires th e serial bus address, the data \nregister address of the MSB register written to the address \npointer register, followed by the two data bytes written to the selected data register.

C | Page 19 of 24 READING DATA  \nReading data from the ADT7410 is done in a single data byte \noperation for the configuration register, the status register, \nthe THYST register, and the ID register. A two data byte read \noperation is needed for the tempe rature value register, T HIGH \nsetpoint register, T LOW setpoint register, and the T CRIT setpoint  \nregister. Reading back the contents of an 8 -bit register similar \nto the configuration register is shown in Figure 17. Reading \nback the contents of the temperature value register is shown \nin Figure  18. \nReading back from any register first re quires a single -byte write \noperation to the address pointer register to set up the address of \nthe register that is going to be read from. In the case of reading \nback from the 2 -byte registers, the address pointer automatically \nincrements from the MSB regis ter address to the LSB register \naddress.  \nTo read from another register, execute another write to the \naddress pointer register to set up the relevant register address. Thus, block reads are not possible, that is, there is no I\n2C address \npointer auto -increment except when reading back from a 16 -bit \nregister. If the address pointer register has previously been set up with the address of the register that is going to receive a read \ncommand, there is no need to repeat a write operation to set up \nthe register address again.  RESET  \nTo reset the ADT7410 without having to reset the entire I2C bu s, \nan explicit reset command is provided. This uses a particular \naddress pointer word as a command w ord to reset the part and \nupload all default settings. The ADT7410 does not respond to \nthe I2C bus commands (do not acknowledge) during the default \nvalues upload for approximately 200 µs.  \nThe re set command address word is 0x2F.  \nGENERAL CALL \nWhen a master issues a slave address consisting of seven 0s with \nthe eighth bit (R/ W bit) set to 0, this is known as the general call \naddress. The general call address is for addressing every device \nconne cted to the I2C bus. The ADT7410 acknowledges this \naddre ss and reads in th e following data byte.  \nIf the second byte is 0x06, the ADT7410 is reset, completely \nuploading all default values. The ADT7410 does n ot respond \nto the I2C bus commands (do not acknowledge) while the \ndefault values upload for approximately 200 µs.  \nThe ADT7410 does not acknowledge any other general call \ncommands.  \nSCL\nSDA1\n1 0 0 1 A2 0 A0\nREPE AT START\nBY MASTER\nFRAME 3\nSERIA L BUS ADDRESS\nBYTEFRAME 4\nDATA BYTE FROM CONFIGUR ATION\nREGISTERSTOP BY\nMASTERACK.

The INT output pin becomes active when the temperature \nis greater than the temperature stored in the T HIGH setpoint register  \nor less than the  temperature stored in the T LOW setpoint register. \nHow thi s pin reacts after this event depends on the overtemper -\nature  mode selected.  \nFigure 19 illustrates the comparator and interrupt modes for \nevents exceeding the T HIGH limit with both pin polarity settings. \nFigure 20 illustrates the comparator and interrupt modes for \nevents exceeding the T LOW limit with both pin polarity settings.  Comparator Mode  \nIn comparator mode, the INT pin returns to its inactive status \nwhen the temperature drops below the T HIGH − T HYST limit or \nrises above the T LOW + T HYST limit.  \nPutting the ADT7410 into shutdown mode does not reset the \nINT state in comparator mode.  \nInterrupt Mode  \nIn interrupt mode, the INT pin only goes inactive when the \nADT7410 register is read, that is, independently, w hen the \ntemperature has recovered and gotten back to within the limits \nbefore Point C, as shown in Figure 20. when  the INT pin is \nreset, it only go es active again when the temperature goes from \nan overtemperature/undertemperature condition back to \na temperature within the limits or vice versa.  \nAs shown in Figure 19, the INT pin goes active when the \ntemperature rises beyond the T HIGH limit and resets the next \ntime any register is read. When  reset, it does not go active again \nuntil temperatures decrease ba ck to below T HIGH − T HYST (Point A),  \nand when  reset, it goes active again when the T HIGH/TLOW is \nexceeded (Point B) . \n \nTEMPER ATURE\n82°C\n81°C\n80°C\n79°C\n78°C\n77°C\n76°C\n75°C\n74°C\n73°C\nINT PIN\n(COM PARATOR MODE)\nPOLARIT Y =ACTIVE LOW\nINT PIN\n(INTERRUPT MODE)\nPOLARIT Y =ACTIVE LOW\nINT PIN\n(INTERRUPT MODE)\nPOLARIT Y =ACTIVE HIGHINT PIN\n(COM PARATOR MODE)\nPOLARIT Y =ACTIVE HIGHTHIGH\nTHIGH –THYST\nTIME\nREAD READ READ\n06560-020AB\n \nFigure 19.

C | Page 23 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION  \nTHERMAL RESPONSE TIM E  \nThe time required for a temperature sensor to settle to a  specified \naccuracy is a function of the thermal mass of the sensor and \nthe thermal conductivity between the sensor and the object \nbeing sensed. Thermal mass is often considered equivalent to \ncapacitance. Thermal conductivity is commonly specified usin g \nthe symbol, Q, and can be thought of as thermal resistance. It is commonly specified in units of degrees per watt of power \ntransferred across the thermal joint. The time required for \nthe part to settle to the desired accuracy is dependent on the \nthermal contact established in a particular application and the \nequivalent power of the heat source. In most applications, it is best to determine the settling time empirically.  \nSUPPLY DECOUPLING  \nDecouple the  ADT7410 with a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor between \nVDD and GND. This is particularly important when the  ADT7410  \nis mounted remotely from the power supply. Precision analog products, such as the ADT7410 , require a well -filtered power \nsource. Because the ADT7410 operates from a single supply, it \nmight seem convenient to tap int o the digital logic power supply . \nUnfortunately, the logic supply is often a switch -mode design, \nwhich generates noise in the 20  kHz to 1  MHz range. In additio n, \nfast logic  gates can generate glitches hundreds of millivolts in \namplitude due to wiring resistance and inductance.  \nIf possible, the power ADT7410  directly from the system power \nsupply. This arrangement, shown in Figure 21, isolates the \nanalog section from the logic switching transients. Even if a separate power supply trace is not available, generous supply \nbypassing  reduces supply -line induced errors. Local supply \nbypassing consisting of a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor is  critical for \nthe temperature accuracy specifications to be achieved. This \ndecoupling capacitor must be placed as close as  possible to the \nV\nDD pin of the  ADT7410.  \n0.1µF ADT7410TTL/CMOS\nLOGIC\nCIRCUITS\nPOWER\nSUPP LY\n06560-022 \nFigure 21. Use of Separate Traces to Reduce Power Supply Noise  TEMPERATURE MONITORING  \nThe ADT7 410 is ideal for monitoring the thermal environment \nwithin electronic equipment. For example, the surface -mounted \npackage accurately reflects the exact thermal conditions that \naffect nearby integrated circuits.  \nThe ADT7410 measures and converts the temperature at the \nsurface of its own semiconductor chip. When the ADT7410 is \nused to measure the temperature of a nearby heat source, the \nthermal impedance between the heat source and the ADT7410 \nmust be considered.  \nWhen the thermal impedance is determined, the temperature of the heat source  can be inferred from the ADT7410 output. As \nmuch as 60% of the heat transferred from the heat source to the thermal sensor on the  ADT7410 die is discharged via the coppe r \ntracks, the package pins, and the bond pads. Of the pins on the ADT7410, the GND pin transfers most of the heat. Therefore, to measure the temperature of a heat source, it is recommended that the thermal resistance between the GND pin of the ADT7410 \nand the GND of the heat source be reduced as much as possible.  \n \n \n \nADT7410 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
