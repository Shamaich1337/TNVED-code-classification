They offer both extrem e low quiescent current, high efficiency, and very low gate thre shold voltage to \nensure start-up with low battery voltage (0.9V typ.). Designed to  maximize battery life in portable products, and minimize swit ching losses by only \nswitching as needed to service the load. PFM converters trans fer a discrete amount of energy per cycle and regulate the output voltage by \nmodulating switching frequency with the constant turn-on ti me. Switching frequency depends on the load, input voltage, and indu ctor value, and it \ncan range up to 150kHz. The SW on resistance is  typically 1 to 1.5 W to minimize sw itch losses. When the output voltage drops, the error \ncomparator enables 150kHz oscillator that turns on the MOSFET around 7.5us and 2.5ms off time. Turning on the MOSFET allows ind uctor current \nto ramp up, storing energy in a magnetic field and when MOSFET turns off that force inductor current through the diode to the o utput capacitor and \nload. As the stored energy is depleted, the current ramp down  until the diode turns off. At this point, inductor may ring due t o residual energy and \nstray capacitance. The output capacitor stores charge when curr ent flow through the diode is high, and release it when the curr ent flow is low, \nthereby maintaining a steady voltage across the load. As the load  increases, the output capacitor discharges faster and the err or comparator \ninitiates cycles sooner, increasing the switching frequency. The maximum duty cycle ensures adequate time for energy transfer t o output during the \nsecond half of each cycle. Depending on the circuit, PFM converter can operate in ei ther discontinuous mode or continuous condu ction mode. \nContinuous conduction mode means that the inductor cu rrent does not ramp to zero during each cycle. \n \nInductor Selection \nTo operate as an efficient energy transfe r element, the inductor must fulfill three r equirements. First, the inductance must be  low enough for the \ninductor to store adequate energy under the worst-case condition of  minimum input voltage and switch ON time. Second, the induc tance must also \nbe high enough so the maximum current rating of AP1603 and inductor ar e not exceeded at the other worst-case condition of maxim um input \nvoltage and ON time. Lastly, the inductor must  have sufficiently low DC resistance so exce ssive power is not lost as heat in th e windings. But \nunfortunately this is inversely related to physical size. Minimum and Maximum input voltage, output voltage and output current must be established \nbefore an inductor can be selected. \n \nCapacitor Selection \nA poor choice for an output capacitor can result in poor efficien cy and high output ripple. Ordi nary aluminum electrolytic capa citors, while \ninexpensive, may have unacceptably poor ESR and ESL. There is a low ESR aluminum capacitor for swit ch mode DC-DC converters whi ch work \nmuch better than the general purpose unit. Tantalum capacitors provide still better performance at more expense. OS-CON capacit ors have \nextremely low ESR in a small size. If capacitance is reduced, t he output ripple will increase. Most of the input supply is supp lied by the input bypass \ncapacitor. The capacitor voltage rating should be at l east 1.25 times greater than a maximum input voltage. \n \n \n \nOrdering Information \n \n \n \n \nPart Number Package Code Packaging 7” Tape and Reel \nQuantity Part Number Suffix \nAP1603WG-7 W SOT26 3000/Tape & Reel -7 \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n\n \nAP1603 \nDocument number: DS31131 Rev. 4 - 2  7 of 8 \nwww.diodes.com  February 2014\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP1603\n \n \n \nMarking Information \n \n(1) SOT26  \n1 2 36\n74\nXXYW X ( Top View )\n75 \n \n \nXX : Identification code \n   Y : Year 0~9 \n  W : Week : A#Z : 1~26 week \na~z : 27~52 week; z represents 52 and 53 week \n   X : A~Z : Green \n \nPart Number Package Identification Code \nAP1603W SOT26 EY \n \n \n \nPackage Outline Dimensions (All dimensions in mm.)   \nPlease see AP02002 at http://www.diodes.com/ datasheets/ap02002.pdf for latest version. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \nSuggested Pad Layout  \nPlease see AP02001 at http://www.diodes.com/dat asheets/ap02001.pdf for the latest version. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n SOT26 \nDim Min Max Typ \nA 0.35 0.50 0.38 \nB 1.50 1.70 1.60 \nC 2.70 3.00 2.80 \nD ⎯ ⎯ 0.95 \nH 2.90 3.10 3.00 \nJ 0.013 0.10 0.05 \nK 1.00 1.30 1.10 \nL 0.35 0.55 0.40 \nM 0.10 0.20 0.15 \nα 0° 8° ⎯ \nAll Dimensions in mm \nDimensions Value (in mm) \nZ 3.20 \nG 1.60 \nX 0.55 \nY 0.80 \nC1 2.40 \nC2 0.95 A\nM\nJL DBC\nH\nK\nXZ\nYC1C2 C2\nG\n \nAP1603 \nDocument number: DS31131 Rev. 4 - 2  8 of 8 \nwww.diodes.com  February 2014\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP1603\n \n \n \n \nIMPORTANT NOTICE \n \nDIODES INCORPORATED MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH REGARDS TO THIS DOCUMENT, \nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE \n(AND THEIR EQUIVALENTS UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION).   \n \nDiodes Incorporated and its subsidiaries rese rve the right to make modifications, enhanc ements, improvements, corrections or ot her changes \nwithout further notice to this document and any product descri bed herein.
