Product Characteristic data \n \n2-1. Capacitance \n \nThe capacitance is the ratio of the change in an electric charg e according to voltage change. \nDue to the fact that the capacitance may be subject to change w ith the measured voltage and \nfrequency, it is highly recommend ed to measure the capacitance based on the following \nconditions. \n  \n2-1-1. Measure capacitance with voltage and frequency specified  in this document. \nRegarding the voltage/frequency condition for capacitance measu rement of each MLCC model, \nplease make sure to follow a section “C. Reliability test Condi tion - Capacitance” in this document. \n \nThe following table shows the voltage and frequency condition a ccording to the capacitance \nrange. \n \n[The voltage and frequency condi tion according to MLCC the capa citance range] \n◆ Class I  \nCapacitance Frequency Voltage \n≤ 1,000 pF 1 MHz ± 10% \n0.5 ~ 5 Vrms \n> 1,000 pF 1 kHz ± 10% \n ◆ Class II  \nCapacitance Frequency Voltage \n≤ 10 ㎌ 1 kHz ± 10% 1.0 ± 0.2 V rms \n> 10 ㎌ 120 Hz ± 20% 0.5 ± 0.1 Vrms \nException* 1 kHz ± 10% 0.5 ± 0.1 V rms \nCapacitance shall be measured af ter the heat treatment of 150+0 /-10℃ \nfor 1hr, leaving at room temperature for 24±2hr. (Class II) \n \n2-1-2. It is recommended to use measurement equipment with the ALC (Auto Level Control) option.  \n      The reason is that when capacitance or measurement freque ncy is high, the output voltage of \n      measurement equipment can be lower than the setting volta ge due to the equipment limitation. \n      Note that when capacitance or measurement frequency is ex cessively high, the measurement \n      equipment may show ALC off warning and provide a lower ou tput voltage than the setting \n      voltage even with ALC opti on selected. It is necessary to  ensure the output voltage of \n      measurement equipment is t he same as the setting voltage before measuring capacitance. \n \n\x001\x000\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n2-1-3. Capacitance value of high  dielectric constant (Class II)  MLCC changes with applied AC and DC \n      voltage. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account MLCC’s AC voltage characteristics and DC- \n      bias voltage characteristics when applying MLCC to the ac tual circuit. \n \n2-1-4. The capacitance is in com pliance with the EIA RS-198-1-F -2002. \n \n 2-2. Tan δ (DF) \n \n2-2-1. An ideal MLCC’s energy loss is zero, but real MLCC has d ielectric loss and re sistance loss of \nelectrode. DF (Dissipation Facto r) is defined as the ratio of loss energy to stored energy and \ntypically being calculated as percentage. \n \n2-2-2. Quality factor (Q factor) is defined as the ratio of sto red energy to loss energy.  \n      The equation can be described as 1/DF. Normally the loss characteristic of Class I MLCC is  \n      presented in Q, since the DF value is so small whereas th e loss characteristic o f Class II MLCC is  \n      presented in DF . \n \n2-2-3. It is recommended to use Class I MLCC for applications t o require good linearity and low loss   \nsuch as coupling circuit, filter circuit and time constant circ uit. \n \n \n2-3. Insulation Resistance \n \nCeramic dielectric has a low leakage current with DC voltage du e to the high insulating properties. \nInsulation resistance is defined as the rati o of a leakage curr ent to DC voltage.  \n \n2-3-1. When applying DC voltage to MLCC, a charging current and  a leakage current flow together at \nthe initial stage of measurement . While the charging current de creases, and insulation resistance \n(IR) in MLCC is saturated by time. Therefore, insulation resistance shall be measured 1 minute after \napplying the rated voltage. \n \n \n2-4. Capacitance Aging \n \nThe aging characteristic is that  the high dielectric (Class II)  MLCC decreases capacitance  \nvalue over time. It is also nece ssary to consider the aging cha racteristic with voltage and \ntemperature characteri stics when Class II MLCC is used in circu itry. \n \n\x001\x001\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n2-4-1. In general, aging causes capacitance to decrease linearl y with the log of time as shown in the  \n      following graph. Please check with SEMCO for more details , since the value may vary between  \n      different models. \n \n2-4-2. After heat treatment (150  °C, 1hour), the capacitance de creased by aging is r ecovered, so aging \nshould be considered a gain from the time of heat treatment.  \n \n[ Example of Capacitance Aging ] \n* Sample : C0G, X7R, X5R \n \n 2-5. Temperature Characteris tics of Capacitance (TCC) \n \nPlease consider temperature characteristics of capacitance sinc e the electrical characteristics such as \ncapacitance changes which is caused by a change in ceramic diel ectric constant by temperature. \n 2-5-1. It is necessary to check the values specified in section  “C. Reliability test Condition–Temperature \nCharacteristics” for the temperature and capacitance change ran ge of MLCC. \n \n   \n[ Example of T emperature Characteristics (X5R) ]             [ Example of Bias TCC ] \n* Sample : 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V       * Sample : 10uF, Rate d voltage 6.3V \n \n\x001\x002\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n2-5-2. When selecting MLCC, it is necessary to consider the hea t characteristics of a system, room  \n      temperature and T CC of ML CC , since the applied temperatur e may change the capacitance of  \n      ML CC. \n \n2-5-3. In addition, Bias TCC of MLCC should be taken into accou nt when DC voltage is applied to MLCC. \n \n \n2-6. Self-heating Temperature \n \nIt is necessary to design the sys tem, with considering self-hea ting generated  by the ESR \n(Equivalent Series Resistance) o f MLCC when AC voltage or pulse  voltage is applied to MLCC. \n \n \n2-6-1. When MLCC is used in an A C voltage or pulse voltage circ uit, self-heating is generated when AC  \n      or pulse current flows through MLCC. Short-circuit may be  occurred by the degradation of MLCC’s  \n      insulating properties. \n \n2-6-2. The reliability of MLCC ma y be affected by MLCC being us ed in an AC voltage or pulse voltage  \n      circuit, even the AC volta ge or the pulse voltage is with in the range of rated voltage. \n      Therefore, make sure to check the following conditions. \n 1) The surface temperature of MLCC must stay within the maximum  operating temperature after  \n  AC or Pulse voltage is applied.  \n 2) The rise in increase by self-h eating of MLCC must not exceed  20℃ \n \n \n[ Example of Ri pple current ] \n* Sample : X5R 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V \n \n \n\x001\x003\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n2-7. DC & AC Voltage Characteristics \n \nIt is required to consider voltage characteristics in the circu it since the capacitance value of high \ndielectric constant MLCC(Class II) is changed by applied DC & A C voltage.  \n \n2-7-1. Please ensure the capacit ance change is w ithin the allow ed operating range of a system. In   \n      particular , when high diel ectric constant type MLCC (Clas s II) is used in circuit with narrow allowed  \n      capacitance tolerance, a system should be designed with c onsidering DC voltage, temperature  \n      characteristics and aging characteristics of MLCC. \n \n \n[ Example of DC Bias characteristics ] \n* Sample : X5R 10uF,  Rated voltage 6.3V \n \n2-7-2. It is necessary to consider the AC voltage characteristi cs of MLCC and the AC voltage of a system,      \n      since the capacitance valu e of high dielec tric constant type MLCC (Class II) varies with the applied  \n      AC voltage. \n \n \n[ Example of AC voltage characteristics ] \n* Sample : X5R 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V \n\x001\x004\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n2-8. Impedance Characteristic \n \nElectrical impedance (Z) of MLCC is the measurement of the oppo sition that MLCC presents to a \ncurrent (I) when a voltage (V) is applied. It is defined as the  ratio of the voltage to the current \n(Z=V/I). Impedance extends the concept of resistance to AC circ uits and is a complex number \nconsisting of the real part of resistance (R) and the imaginary  part of reactance (X) as Z=R+jX.  \nTherefore, it is required to des ign circuit with consideration of the impedance characteristics of \nMLCC based on the frequency ( Z = R + jX ) \n \n 2-8-1. MLCC operates as a capacitor in the low frequency and it s reactance (XC) decreases as frequency \nincreases ( X_C=1/j2πfC ) where f is frequency and C is capacit ance. \nThe resistance (ESR; Equivalent Series Resistance) of MLCC in t he low frequency mainly comes \nfrom the loss of its dielectric material.  \n \n2-8-2. MLCC operates as an induc tor in the high frequency and t he inductance of MLCC is called ESL \n(Equivalent Series Inductance). The reactance (XL) of MLCC in t he high frequency increases as \nfrequency increases ( X_L=j2πf∙E SL ). The resistance (ESR) of M LCC in the high frequency mainly \ncomes from the loss of its electrode metal. \n \n2-8-3. SRF (Self Reson ant Frequency) of MLCC is the frequency w here its capacitive reactance (XC) and  \ninductive reactance(XL) cancel e ach other and the impedance of MLCC has only ESR at SRF.  \n \n \n2-8-4. The impedance of MLCC can be measured by a network analy zer or an impedance analyzer.   \n      When using the network analyzer, please note that the sma ll-signal input may lead to the \n      impedance of low capacitance caused by the AC voltage cha racteristic of MLCC. \n \n \n[ Example of Impedance characteristics ] \n* Sample : X5R 1uF, Rated voltage 6.3V \n\x001\x005\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n3. Electrical & Mechanical Caution \n \n3-1. Derating \n \nMLCC with the test voltage at 100%  of the rated voltage in the high temperature resistance test  \nare labeled as “derated MLCC.” Fo r this type of MLCC, the volta ge and temperature should be  \nderated as shown in the following graph for the equivalent life  time of a normal MLCC with the  \ntest voltage at 150% of the rated voltage in the high temperatu re resistance test.  \n 3-1-1. The derated MLCC should b e applied with the derating vol tage and temperature  as shown in the \nfollowing graph. \n \n3-1-2. The “Temperature of MLCC” in the x-axis of the graph bel ow indicates the sur face temperature of \nMLCC including self-heating effect .

Applied Voltage \n \nThe actual applied volt age on MLCC should not exceed the rated voltage set in the specifications. \n3-2-1. Cautions by types of voltage applied to MLCC  \n \n· For DC voltage or DC+AC voltag e, DC voltage or the maximum value of DC + AC voltage should  \n  not exceed the rated voltage of MLCC. \n· For AC voltage or pulse voltag e, the peak-to-peak value of AC  voltage or pulse voltage \nshould not exceed the rated voltage of MLCC. \n· Abnormal voltage such as surge  voltage, static electricity sh ould not exceed the rated voltage of \nMLCC. \n \n[Types of Voltage Applied to the Capacitor] \nDC Voltage AC Voltage DC+AC Voltage 1 DC+AC Voltage 2 DC+Pulse Voltage\n  \n \n3-2-2. Effect of EOS (Electrical Overstress) \n \n· Electrical Overstress such as a surge voltage or EOS can caus e damages to MLCC, resulting in \nthe electrical short failure cau sed by the dielectric breakdown  in MLCC. \n· Down time of MLCC is varied wi th the applied voltage and the room temperature and a \ndielectric shock caused by EOS c an accelerate heating on the di electric. Therefore, it can bring \nabout a failure of MLCC in a market at the early stage.  \n· Please use caution not to appl y excessive electrical overstre ss including spike voltage MLCC when \npreparing MLCC for testing or evaluating. \n \n(1) Surge \nWhen the overcurrent caused by su rge is applied to MLCC, the in flux of current into MLCC can \ninduce the overshooting phenomenon of voltage as shown in the g raph below and result in the \nelectrical short failure in MLCC . Therefore, it is necessary to  be careful to prevent the influx of \nsurge current into MLCC.  \n \n(2) ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) \n \nSince the voltage of the static electricity is very high but the quantity of electric charge is small \ncompared to the surge, ESD can cause damage to MLCC with low ca pacitance as shown in the \n\x001\x007\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \nfollowing graph, whereas surge wit h lots of electric charge qua ntity can cause damages to even \nhigh capacitance MLCC. \n \n   \n[ Example of Surge applied to ML CC ]             [ Example of E SD applied to MLCC ] \n* Simulation for ESD 8kV \n  \n3-3. Vibration \n \n      Please check the types of vibration and shock, and the st atus of resonance. \n      Manage MLCC not to generate resonance and avoid any kind of impact to terminals. \n      When MLCC is used in a vibration environment, please make  sure to contact us for the situation \n      and consider special MLCC such as Soft-term, etc.  \n \n3-4. Shock \n \nMechanical stress caused by a drop may cause damages to a diele ctric or a crack in MLCC \nDo not use a dropped MLCC to avoi d any quality and reliability deterioration. \nWhen piling up or handling printed circuit boards, do not hit M LCC with the corners of a PCB to \nprevent cracks or any othe r damages to the MLCC. \n  \n3-5. Piezo-electric Phenomenon \n \nMLCC may generate a noise due to vibration at specific frequenc y when using the high dielectric \nconstant MLCC (Class Ⅱ) at AC or Pulse circuits.  MLCC may cause a noise if MLCC is affected by any mechanical vi brations or shocks. \n \n\x001\x008\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n4. Process of Mounting and Soldering \n \n4-1. Mounting \n \n4-1-1. Mounting position \nIt is recommended to locate the major axis of MLCC in parallel to the direction in which the stress  \nis applied. \n \n \nNot recommended                           Recommended \n \n4-1-2. Cautions during mounting near the cutout \nPlease take the followi ng measures to effectively reduce the st ress generated from  the cutting of \nPCB. Select the mounti ng location shown below, since the mechan ical stress is affected by a  \nlocation and a direction of MLCC mounted near the cutting line.  \n \n \n 4-1-3. Cautions during mounting near screw \nIf MLCC is mounted near a screw hole, the board deflection may be occurred by screw torque. \nMount MLCC as far from the  screw holes as possible\n. \n \n \nNot recommended        Recommended \n\x001\x009\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n4-2. Caution before Mounting \n \n4-2-1. It is recommended to store  and use MLCC in a reel. Do no t re-use MLCC that was isolated from \nthe reel. \n4-2-2. Check the capacitance cha racteristics under actual appli ed voltage. \n4-2-3. Check the mechanical stre ss when actual process and equi pment is in use. \n4-2-4. Check the rated capacitan ce, rated voltage and other ele ctrical characteristics before assembly. \n     Heat treatment must be done  prior to measurement of capaci tance. \n4-2-5. Check the solderability of  MLCC that has passed shelf li fe before use. \n4-2-6. The use of Sn-Zn based solder may deteriorate the reliab ility of MLCC. \n \n 4-3. Cautions during Mounting with Mounting (pick-and-place) Ma chines\n \n \n4-3-1. Mounting Head Pressure \nExcessive pressure may c ause cracks in MLCC. \nIt is recommended to adjust the nozzle pressure within the maxi mum value of 300g.f. \nAdditional conditions must be set for both thin film and specia l purpose MLCC. \n4-3-2. Bending Stress \nWhen using a two-sided substrate, it is required to mount MLCC on one side first before \nmounting on the other side due to the bending of the substrate caused by the mounting head. \nSupport the substrate as shown in the picture below when MLCC i s mounted on the other side. \nIf the substrate is not supported, bending of the substrate may  cause cracks in MLCC. \n \n \n 4-3-3. Suction nozzle \nDust accumulated in a suction nozzle and suction mechanism can impede a smooth movement of \nthe nozzle. This may cause cracks in MLCC due to the excessive force during mounting. \nIf the mounting claw is worn out, it may cause cracks in MLCC d ue to the uneven force during \npositioning. \n A regular inspection such as ma intenance, monit or and replacem ent for the suct ion nozzle and \n mounting claw should be conducted. \n\x002\x000\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n4-4. Reflow soldering \n \nMLCC is in a direct contact with  the dissolved solder during so ldering, which may  be exposed to \npotential mechanical stress caus ed by the sudden  temperature ch ange. \nTherefore, MLCC may be contamina ted by the location movement an d flux.  \nFor the reason, the mounting pro cess must be closely monitored.  \n \nMethod Classification \nReflow soldering Overall heating Infrared rays \nHot plate \nVPS(Vapor phase) \nLocal heating Air heater \nLaser \nLight beam \n 4-4-1. Reflow Profile \n \n[Reflow Soldering Conditions] \n \nUse caution not to exceed the pea k temperature (260℃) and time (30sec) as shown. \nPre-heating is necessary for all constituents including the PCB  to prevent the me chanical damages  \non MLCC. The temperature difference between the PCB and the component surface must be kept  to the minimum.  \n      As for reflow soldering, it  is recommended to keep the nu mber of reflow soldering to less than \n      three times. Please check wi th us when the number of refl ow soldering needs to exceed three  \n      times. Care must be exerc ised especially for the ultra-sm all size, thin film and high capacitance \n      MLCC as they can be affect ed by thermal stress more easil y. \n\x002\x001\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n4-4-2. Reflow temperature \nThe following quality problem may occur when MLCC is mounted wi th a lower temperature than \nthe reflow temperature recommended by a solder manufacturer. Th e specified peak temperature \nmust be maintained after taking into consideration the factors such as the placement of \nperipheral constituent and the reflow temperature. \n ･Drop in solder wettability \n･Solder voids \n･Potential occurrence of whisker \n･Drop in adhesive strength \n･Drop in self-alignment properties \n･Potential occurrence of tombstones \n \n4-4-3. Cooling \nNatural cooling with air is recommended. \n \n4-4-4. Optimum solder flux for reflow soldering \n· Overly the thick application of  solder pastes results in an e xcessive solder fillet height. \n  This makes MLCC more vulnerable  to the mechanical and thermal  stress from the board, which  \n  may cause cracks in MLCC. \n· Too little solder paste results in a lack of the adhesive str ength, which may cause MLCC to \nisolate from PCB \n· Check if solder has been applied uniforml y after soldering is  completed. \n \n  \n  \n   \n· It is required to design a PCB with consideration of a solder land pattern and its size to apply an  \n appropriate amount of solder to MLCC. The amount of the solder  at the edge may impact \n directly on cracks in MLCC.   \n· The design of a suitable solder land is necessary since the m ore the solder amount is, \n  the larger the force MLCC expe riences and the higher the chan ce MLCC cracks. \n \n Too Much Solder \nlarge stress may cause cracks  Not enough solder \nWeak holding force may cause bad \nconnections or detaching of the capacitor  \n\x002\x002\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n4-5. Flow soldering \n \n4-5-1. Flow profile  \n \n[Flow Soldering Conditions] \n \nTake caution not to exceed peak temperature (260℃) and time (5s ec) as shown. \nIn case of flow soldering, only 1608(0603inch), 2012(0805inch),  3216(1206inch) case size are \nrecommended to use.  Please contact us before use the type of high capacitance and t hin film MLCC for some \nexceptions that may be caused. \n \n4-5-2. Caution before Flow soldering  \n· When a sudden heat is applied to MLCC, the mechanical rigidit y of MLCC is deteriorated by the \ninternal deformation of MLCC. Preheating all the constituents i ncluding PCB is required to prevent \nthe mechanical damages on MLCC. The temperature difference betw een the solder and the \nsurface of MLCC must be kept to the minimum. \n \n· If the flow time is too long or the flow temperature is too h igh, the adhesive strength with PCB \nmay be deteriorated by the leach ing phenomen on of the outer ter mination, or the capacitance \nvalue may be dropped by weak adhe sion between the internal termination and the outer \ntermination.    \n\x002\x003\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n4-6. Soldering Iron \n \nManual soldering can pose a great risk on creating thermal crac ks in MLCC. The high temperature  \nsoldering iron tip may come into a direct contact with the cera mic body of MLCC due to the  \ncarelessness of an operator. Ther efore, the soldering iron must be handled carefully, and close  \nattention must be paid to the se lection of the soldering iron tip and to temperature control of the  \ntip. \n \n4-6-1. How to use a soldering Iron \n· In order to minimize damages o n MLCC, preheating MLCC and PCB  is necessary. \n  A hot plate and a hot air type preheater should be used for p reheating \n. Do not cool down MLCC and PCB rapidly after soldering. · Keep the contact time between t he outer termination of MLCC a nd the soldering iron as short as  \n  possible.

How to use a spot heater \n· Compared to local heating using a solder iron, heat by a spot  heater heats the overall MLCC and \nthe PCB, which is likely to l essen the thermal shocks.  \nFor a high density PCB, a spot heater can prevent the problem t o connect between a solder iron \nand MLCC directly.  \n \n· If the distance from the air nozzle outlet to MLCC is too clo se, MLCC may be cracked due to the \nthermal stress. Follow the condit ions set in the table below to prevent this problem. \nThe spot heater applic ation angle as shown in the figure is rec ommended to create a suitable  \nsolder fillet shape. \n \n· In case that heat of higher than 350℃ is applied to MLCC contai ning epo xy material,  \nthe epox y \nmaterial in MLCC may be damaged by heat. \n\x002\x004\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  4-6-3. Cautions for re-work \n· Too much solder amount will increase the risk of PCB bending or cause other damages.  \n· Too little solder amount will result in MLCC breaking loose f rom the PCB due to the \ninadequate adhesive strength. \n· Check if the solder has been applied properly and ensure the solder fillet has a proper shape. \n \n \n* Soldering wire below ø0.5mm is required for soldering. \n \n 4-7. Cleaning \n \n4-7-1. In general, cleaning is unnecessary if rosin flux is use d. \nWhen acidic flux is used strongly, chlorine in the flux may dissolve into some types of cleaning \nfluids, thereby affecting the performance of MLCC.  This means that the cleansing so lution must be carefully select ed and should always be new. \n \n4-7-2. Cautions for cleaning       MLCC or solder joint may be cracked with the vibration of  PCB, if ultrasonic vibration is too strong \n      during cleaning. When high pressure cleaning equipment is used, test should be done for the        cleaning equipment and its process before the cleaning in  order to avoid damages on MLCC. \n \n Distance ≥ 5 ㎜ \nHot Air Application angle 45℃ \nHot Air Temperature Nozzle Outlet ≤ 400℃ \nApplication Time ≤ 10s \n\x002\x005\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n4-8. Cautions for using electrical measuring probes \n \n· Confirm the position of the support pin or jig when checking the electrical performance of MLCC \n  after mounting on the PCB. \n· Watch for PCB bending caused by the pressure of a test-probe or other equipment. \n· If the PCB is bent by the forc e from the test probe, MLCC may be cracked or the solder joint may  \n  be damaged. \n· Avoid PCB flexing by using the support pin on the back side o f the PCB. \n· Place equipment with the support pin as close to the test-pro be as possible.  \n· Prevent shock vibrations of th e board when the test-probe con tacts a PCB. \n \n \nNot recommended                               Recommended \n \n 4-9. Printed Circuit Board Cropping\n \n \n· Do not apply any stress to MLCC such as bending or twisting t he board after mounting MLCC  \non the PCB.  · The stress as shown may cause cracks in MLCC when cutting the  board. \n· Cracked MLCC may cause degradation to the insulation resistan ce, thereby causing short circuit. \n· Avoid these types of str esses applied to MLCC. \n \n             [Bending]                                  [T wisti ng] \n \n 4-9-1. Cautions for cutting PCB \nCheck a cutting method of PCB in advance.  \nThe high density board is separated into many individual boards  after the completion of soldering. \nIf the board is bent or deformed  during separation, MLCC may be  cracked. \nCarefully select a separation method that minimizes the deforma tion of the PCB. \n\x002\x006\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n4-10. Assembly Handling \n \n4-10-1. Cautions for PCB handling \nHold the edges of the board mounted with MLCC with both hands s ince holding with one hand  \nmay bend the board. \nDo not use dropped boards, which may degrade the quality of MLC C. \n \n4-10-2. Mounting other components \nPay attention to the following c onditions when mounting other c omponents on the back side of  \nThe board after MLCC has been mounted on the front side. \nWhen the suction nozzle is placed too close to the board, board  deflection stress may be \napplied to MLCC on the back side , resulting in cracks in MLCC. \nCheck if proper value is set on each chip mounter for a suction  location, a mounting gap and a \nsuction gap by the thi ckness of components. \n \n \n \n4-10-3. Board mounting components with leads  \n If the board is bent when inserting components (transformer, I C, etc.) into it, MLCC or solder  \njoint may be cracked. \n \nPay attention to the following: \n· Reduce the stress on the board  during insertion by increasing  the size of the lead insertion  \n  hole. \n· Insert components with leads into the board after fixing the board with support pins or a  \n  dedicated jig. \n· Support the bottom side of the board to avoid bending the boa rd. \n· Check the status of the height of each support pin regularly when the support pins are used.  \n \n \nNot recommended                            Recommended \n\x002\x007\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n4-10-4.

Fastening screw \nWhen attaching a shield on a board, the board may be bent durin g a screw tightening work \n \nPay attention to the following conditions before performing the  work.  \n· Plan the work to prevent the board from bending \n· Use a torque driver to prevent over-tightening of the screw. \n· Since the board may be bent by soldering, use caution in tigh tening the screw. \n \n \n4-11. Adhesive selection \n \nPay attention to the following i f an adhesive is used to positi on MLCC on the board before  \nsoldering.  \n \n4-11-1. Requirements for Adhesives \n· They must have enough adhesive strength to prevent MLCC from slipping or moving during  \n  the handling the board. \n· They must maintain their adhes ive strength when exposed to so ldering temperatures. \n· They should not spread when applied to the PCB. \n      · They should have a long pot life. \n· They should hardened quickly. \n      · They should not corrode the board or MLCC materials. \n· They should be an insulator type that does not affect the cha racteristic of MLCC.   \n      · They should be non-toxic, not harmful, and particularly  safe when workers touch theadhesives. \n \n4-11-2. Caution befor e Applying Adhesive \nCheck the correct application conditions bef ore attaching MLCC to the board with an adhesive.   \nIf the dimension of land, the type of adhesives, the amount of coating, the contact surface areas, \nthe curing temperature, or other conditions are not appropriate , it may degrade the MLCC \nperformance. \n\x002\x008\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n \n4-11-3. Cautions for selecting Adhesive  \nDepending on the type of the chos en adhesive, MLCC insulation r esistance may be degraded. \nIn addition, MLCC may be cracked  by the differen ce in contracti le stress caused b y the different \ncontraction rate between  MLCC and the adhesive. \n \n4-11-4. Cautions for the amount of applied adhesive and curing temperature \n· The inappropriate amount of the adhesive cause the weak adhes ive strength, resulting in the a  \n  mounting defect in MLCC \n· Excessive use of the adhesive m ay cause a soldering defect, l oss of electrical connection,  \n  incorrect curing, or slippage of a mounting position, thereby  an inflow of the adhesive onto a  \n  land section should be avoided. \n   · If the curing temperature i s too high or the curing time i s too long, the adhes ive strength will  \n     be degraded. In addition, o xidation both on the outer term ination (Sn) of MLCC and the  \n     surface of the board may deteriorate the solderability. \n \n \n4-12. Flux \n \n4-12-1. The excessive amount of f lux generates excessive flux g ases which may deteriorate solderability. \nTherefore, apply the flux thin and evenly as a whole. \n4-12-2. Flux with a high ratio of  halogen may oxidize the outer  termination of MLCC, if cleaning is not \ndone properly. Therefore, use flux with a halogen content of 0. 1% max. \n4-12-3. Strong acidic flux can degrade the MLCC performance \n4-12-4. Check the solde r quality of MLCC an d the amount of rema ining flux surrounding MLCC after the  \n       mounting process. \n \n 4-13. Coating \n \n4-13-1. Crack caused by Coating \nA crack may be caused in the MLCC due to amount of the resin an d stress of thermal \ncontraction of the resin d uring coating process. \nDuring the coating process, the a mount of resin and the stress of thermal contraction of the  \nresin may cause cracks in MLCC The difference of thermal expan sion coefficient between the coa ting, or a molding resin may \ncause destruction, deterioration of insulation resistance or di electric breakdo wn of MLCC such \nas cracks or detachment, etc.  \n\x002\x009\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n4-13-2. Recommended Coating material \n· A thermal expansion coefficient should be as close to that of  MLCC as possible. \n· A silicone resin can be used as  an under-coating  to buffer th e stress. \n· The resin should have a minimum curing contraction rate. \n· The resin should have a minimum sensitivity (ex. Epoxy resin) . \n· The insulation resistance of M LCC can be deter iorated if a hi gh hygroscopic property resin is \nused in a high humidity condition. \n· Do not use strong acid substances due to the fact that coatin g materials inducing a family of \nhalogen substances and organic acid may corrode MLCC.  \n \n        \n \n            \n \n     \n\x003\x000\n \nMLCC Product Manual \n \n \n5.  Design \n \n5-1. Circuit design \n \nWhen the board is dropped or ben t, MLCC mounted on the board ma y be short-circuited by the  \ndrop in insulation resistance.

Unlike lead type components, SMD type components that ar e designed to be m ounted directly  \n      on the board are fragile to the stress. In addition, they  are more sensitive to mechanical and  \n      thermal stress than lead type components.  \n \n \n5-2-2. MLCC crack by PCB material type \nA great difference of the therma l expansion coefficient between  PCB and MLCC causes thermal  \nexpansion and contraction, resul ting in cracks in MLCC.
