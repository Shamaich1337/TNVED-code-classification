The TMS320C64x ™\n(C64x ™†) device is based on the second-generation high-performance, advanced VelociTI ™\nvery-long-instruction-word (VLIW) architecture (VelociTI.2 ™) developed by Texas Instruments (TI), making\nthese DSPs an excellent choice for multichannel and multifunction applications. The C64x ™ is a\ncode-compatible member of the C6000 ™ DSP platform.\nWith performance of up to 5760 million instructions per second (MIPS) at a clock rate of 720 MHz, the C64x\ndevices offer cost-effective solutions to high-performance DSP programming challenges. The C64x DSPspossess the operational flexibility of high-speed controllers and the numerical capability of array processors.The C64x ™ DSP core processor has 64 general-purpose registers of 32-bit word length and eight highly\nindependent functional units—two multipliers for a 32-bit result and six arithmetic logic units (ALUs)— withVelociTI.2 ™ extensions. The VelociTI.2 ™ extensions in the eight functional units include new instructions to\naccelerate the performance in key applications and extend the parallelism of the VelociTI ™ architecture. The\nC64x can produce four 16-bit multiply-accumulates (MACs) per cycle for a total of 2880 million MACs persecond (MMACS), or eight 8-bit MACs per cycle for a total of 5760 MMACS. The C64x DSP also has\napplication-specific hardware logic, on-chip memory, and additional on-chip peripherals similar to the otherC6000 ™ DSP platform devices.\nThe C6416 device has two high-performance embedded coprocessors [Viterbi Decoder Coprocessor (VCP)\nand Turbo Decoder Coprocessor (TCP)] that significantly speed up channel-decoding operations on-chip. TheVCP operating at CPU clock divided-by-4 can decode over 600 7.95-Kbps adaptive multi-rate (AMR) [K = 9,R = 1/3] voice channels. The VCP supports constraint lengths K = 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, rates R = 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4,and flexible polynomials, while generating hard decisions or soft decisions. The TCP operating at CPU clockdivided-by-2 can decode up to forty-three 384-Kbps or seven 2-Mbps turbo encoded channels (assuming 6iterations). The TCP implements the max*log-map algorithm and is designed to support all polynomials andrates required by Third-Generation Partnership Projects (3GPP and 3GPP2), with fully programmable framelength and turbo interleaver. Decoding parameters such as the number of iterations and stopping criteria arealso programmable. Communications between the VCP/TCP and the CPU are carried out through the EDMAcontroller.\nThe C64x uses a two-level cache-based architecture and has a powerful and diverse set of peripherals. The\nLevel 1 program cache (L1P) is a 128-Kbit direct mapped cache and the Level 1 data cache (L1D) is a 128-Kbit\n2-way set-associative cache. The Level 2 memory/cache (L2) consists of an 8-Mbit memory space that isshared between program and data space. L2 memory can be configured as mapped memory or combinations\nof cache (up to 256K bytes) and mapped memory . The peripheral set includes three multichannel buf fered serial\nports (McBSPs); an 8-bit Universal Test and Operations PHY Interface for Asynchronous T ransfer Mode (ATM)\nSlave [UT OPIA Slave] port (C6415/C6416 only); three 32-bit general-purpose timers; a user-configurable 16-bit\nor 32-bit host-port interface (HPI16/HPI32); a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) [C6415/C6416 only];a general-purpose input/output port (GPIO) with 16 GPIO pins; and two glueless external memory interfaces(64-bit EMIFA and 16-bit EMIFB\n‡), both of which are capable of interfacing to synchronous and asynchronous\nmemories and peripherals.\nThe C64x has a complete set of development tools which includes: an advanced C compiler with C64x-specific\nenhancements, an assembly optimizer to simplify programming and scheduling, and a Windows ™ debugger\ninterface for visibility into source code execution.\nTMS320C6000, C64x, and C6000 are trademarks of Texas Instruments.\nWindows is a registered trademark of the Microsoft Corporation.\nAll trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\n†Throughout the remainder of this document, the TMS320C6414, TMS320C6415, and TMS320C6416 shall be referred to as TMS320C64x or\nC64x where generic, and where specific, their individual full device part numbers will be used or abbreviated as C6414, C6415, or C6416.\n‡These C64x ™ devices have two EMIFs (64-bit EMIFA and 16-bit EMIFB).

The VelociTI ™ VLIW architecture\nfeatures controls by which all eight units do not have to be supplied with instructions if they are not ready toexecute. The first bit of every 32-bit instruction determines if the next instruction belongs to the same execute\npacket as the previous instruction, or whether it should be executed in the following clock as a part of the next\nexecute packet. Fetch packets are always 256 bits wide; however, the execute packets can vary in size. Thevariable-length execute packets are a key memory-saving feature, distinguishing the C64x CPUs from otherVLIW architectures. The C64x ™ VelociTI.2 ™ extensions add enhancements to the TMS320C62x ™ DSP\nVelociTI ™ architecture. These enhancements include:\n/C0068Register file enhancements\n/C0068Data path extensions\n/C0068Quad 8-bit and dual 16-bit extensions with data flow enhancements\n/C0068Additional functional unit hardware\n/C0068Increased orthogonality of the instruction set\n/C0068Additional instructions that reduce code size and increase register flexibility\nThe CPU features two sets of functional units. Each set contains four units and a register file. One set contains\nfunctional units .L1, .S1, .M1, and .D1; the other set contains units .D2, .M2, .S2, and .L2. The two register fileseach contain 32 32-bit registers for a total of 64 general-purpose registers. In addition to supporting the packed\n16-bit and 32-/40-bit fixed-point data types found in the C62x ™ VelociTI ™ VLIW architecture, the C64x ™ register\nfiles also support packed 8-bit data and 64-bit fixed-point data types. The two sets of functional units, along with\ntwo register files, compose sides A and B of the CPU [see the functional block and CPU (DSP core) diagram,and Figure 1]. The four functional units on each side of the CPU can freely share the 32 registers belonging to\nthat side. Additionally, each side features a “data cross path”—a single data bus connected to all the registers\non the other side, by which the two sets of functional units can access data from the register files on the oppositeside. The C64x CPU pipelines data-cross-path accesses over multiple clock cycles. This allows the sameregister to be used as a data-cross-path operand by multiple functional units in the same execute packet. Allfunctional units in the C64x CPU can access operands via the data cross path. Register access by functional\nunits on the same side of the CPU as the register file can service all the units in a single clock cycle. On the C64x\nCPU, a delay clock is introduced whenever an instruction attempts to read a register via a data cross path if that\nregister was updated in the previous clock cycle.\nIn addition to the C62x ™ DSP fixed-point instructions, the C64x ™ DSP includes a comprehensive collection of\nquad 8-bit and dual 16-bit instruction set extensions. These VelociTI.2 ™ extensions allow the C64x CPU to\noperate directly on packed data to streamline data flow and increase instruction set efficiency.\nAnother key feature of the C64x CPU is the load/store architecture, where all instructions operate on registers\n(as opposed to data in memory). Two sets of data-addressing units (.D1 and .D2) are responsible for all datatransfers between the register files and the memory. The data address driven by the .D units allows dataaddresses generated from one register file to be used to load or store data to or from the other register file. The\nC64x .D units can load and store bytes (8 bits), half-words (16 bits), and words (32 bits) with a single instruction.\nAnd with the new data path extensions, the C64x .D unit can load and store doublewords (64 bits) with a singleinstruction. Furthermore, the non-aligned load and store instructions allow the .D units to access words anddoublewords on any byte boundary. The C64x CPU supports a variety of indirect addressing modes using either\nlinear- or circular-addressing with 5- or 15-bit offsets. All instructions are conditional, and most can access any\none of the 64 registers. Some registers, however, are singled out to support specific addressing modes or tohold the condition for conditional instructions (if the condition is not automatically “true”).\nTMS320C62x is a trademark of Texas Instruments.\nTMS320C6414, TMS320C6415, TMS320C6416\nFIXED-POINT DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS\nSPRS146N − FEBRUARY 2001 − REVISED MAY 2005\n9 POST OFFICE BOX 1443 • HOUSTON, TEXAS 77251 −1443CPU (DSP core) description (continued)\nThe two .M functional units perform all multiplication operations. Each of the C64x .M units can perform two\n16 × 16-bit multiplies or four 8 ×8-bit multiplies per clock cycle. The .M unit can also perform 16 ×32-bit multiply\noperations, dual 16 ×16-bit multiplies with add/subtract operations, and quad 8 ×8-bit multiplies with add\noperations. In addition to standard multiplies, the C64x .M units include bit-count, rotate, Galois field multiplies,\nand bidirectional variable shift hardware.\nThe two .S and .L functional units perform a general set of arithmetic, logical, and branch functions with results\navailable every clock cycle. The arithmetic and logical functions on the C64x CPU include single 32-bit, dual16-bit, and quad 8-bit operations.\nThe processing flow begins when a 256-bit-wide instruction fetch packet is fetched from a program memory.\nThe 32-bit instructions destined for the individual functional units are “linked” together by “1” bits in the leastsignificant bit (LSB) position of the instructions. The instructions that are “chained” together for simultaneousexecution (up to eight in total) compose an execute packet. A “0” in the LSB of an instruction breaks the chain,\neffectively placing the instructions that follow it in the next execute packet. A C64x ™ DSP device enhancement\nnow allows execute packets to cross fetch-packet boundaries. In the TMS320C62x ™/TMS320C67x ™ DSP\ndevices, if an execute packet crosses the fetch-packet boundary (256 bits wide), the assembler places it in the\nnext fetch packet, while the remainder of the current fetch packet is padded with NOP instructions. In the C64x ™\nDSP device, the execute boundary restrictions have been removed, thereby, eliminating all of the NOPs added\nto pad the fetch packet, and thus, decreasing the overall code size. The number of execute packets within afetch packet can vary from one to eight. Execute packets are dispatched to their respective functional units atthe rate of one per clock cycle and the next 256-bit fetch packet is not fetched until all the execute packets fromthe current fetch packet have been dispatched. After decoding, the instructions simultaneously drive all activefunctional units for a maximum execution rate of eight instructions every clock cycle. While most results arestored in 32-bit registers, they can be subsequently moved to memory as bytes, half-words, words, ordoublewords. All load and store instructions are byte-, half-word-, word-, or doubleword-addressable.\nFor more details on the C64x CPU functional units enhancements, see the following documents:\nThe TMS320C6000 CPU and Instruction Set Reference Guide  (literature number SPRU189)\nTMS320C64x Technical Overview  (literature number SPRU395)\nHow To Begin Development Today With the TMS320C6414, TMS320C6415, and TMS320C6416 DSPs\napplication report (literature number SPRA718)\nTMS320C67x is a trademark of Texas Instruments.\nTMS320C6414, TMS320C6415, TMS320C6416\nFIXED-POINT DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS\nSPRS146N − FEBRUARY 2001 − REVISED MAY 2005\n10 POST OFFICE BOX 1443 • HOUSTON, TEXAS 77251 −1443CPU (DSP core) description (continued)\n.L1\n.S1\n.M1\n.D1\n.D2\n.M2\n.S2\n.L2src1long dst\n8\n8src2\nDA1 (Address)ST1b (Store Data)\nST2a (Store Data)Register\nFile A\n(A0−A31)8\n8\n8\n8\ndstData Path A\nDA2 (Address)\nRegister\nFile B\n(B0− B31)LD2a (Load Data)\nData Path B\nControl Register\nFileST2b (Store Data)LD1b (Load Data)\n8\n82X\n1XST1a (Store Data)\nSee Note A\nSee Note A\nLD1a (Load Data)\nLD2b (Load Data)\nSee Note ASee Note A\n32 MSBs\n32 LSBs32 MSBs32 LSBs32 MSBs\n32 LSBs32 MSBs\n32 LSBssrc2src1\ndst\nlong dst\nlong src\nlong src\nlong dst\ndst\nsrc1\nsrc2\nsrc1\nsrc2\nsrc2\nsrc1\ndstsrc2\nsrc1\ndstsrc2\nlong dst\nsrc2\nsrc1\ndstlong dst\nlong dst\nlong src\nlong src\nlong dstdst\ndst\nsrc2\nsrc1dst\nNOTE A: For the .M functional units, the long dst is 32 MSBs and the dst is 32 LSBs.\nFigure 1.

Some of\nthese pins are configured by software, and the others are configured by external pullup/pulldown resistors only\nat reset. Those muxed pins that are configured by software can be programmed to switch functionalities at anytime. Those muxed pins that are configured by external pullup/pulldown resistors are mutually exclusive; onlyone peripheral has primary control of the function of these pins after reset. Table 29 identifies the multiplexedpins on the C6414, C6415, and C6416 devices; shows the default (primary) function and the default settingsafter reset; and describes the pins, registers, etc. necessary to configure specific multiplexed functions.\ndebugging considerations \nIt is recommended that external connections be provided to device configuration pins, includingCLKMODE[1:0], BEA[20:13, 11, 9:7], HD5/AD5, PCI_EN, and MCBSP2_EN. Although internal pullup/pulldown\nresistors exist on these pins (except for HD5/AD5), providing external connectivity adds convenience to the user\nin debugging and flexibility in switching operating modes.\nInternal pullup/pulldown resistors also exist on the non-configuration pins on the BEA bus (BEA[12, 10, 6:1]).\nDo not oppose the internal pullup/pulldown resistors on these non-configuration pins with externalpullup/pulldown resistors. If an external controller provides signals to these non-configuration pins, thesesignals must be driven to the default state of the pins at reset, or not be driven at all.\nFor the internal pullup/pulldown resistors on the C6414, C6415, and C6416 device pins, see the terminal\nfunctions table.\nTMS320C6414, TMS320C6415, TMS320C6416\nFIXED-POINT DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS\nSPRS146N − FEBRUARY 2001 − REVISED MAY 2005\n41 POST OFFICE BOX 1443 • HOUSTON, TEXAS 77251 −1443DEVICE CONFIGURATIONS (CONTINUED)\nTable 29.

Each DSP commercial family member has one of three prefixes: TMX, TMP, or TMS\n(i.e., TMS 320C6412GTS600) Texas Instruments recommends two of three possible prefix designators for its\nsupport tools: TMDX and TMDS. These prefixes represent evolutionary stages of product development fromengineering prototypes (TMX/TMDX) through fully qualified production devices/tools (TMS/TMDS).\nDevice development evolutionary flow:\nTMX Experimental device that is not necessarily representative of the final device’s electrical\nspecifications\nTMP Final silicon die that conforms to the device’s electrical specifications but has not completed\nquality and reliability verification\nTMS Fully qualified production device\nSupport tool development evolutionary flow:\nTMDX Development-support product that has not yet completed Texas Instruments internal qualification\ntesting\nTMDS Fully qualified development-support product\nTMX and TMP devices and TMDX development-support tools are shipped against the following disclaimer:“Developmental product is intended for internal evaluation purposes.”TMS devices and TMDS development-support tools have been characterized fully, and the quality and reliability\nof the device have been demonstrated fully. TI’s standard warranty applies.\nPredictions show that prototype devices (TMX or TMP) have a greater failure rate than the standard production\ndevices. T exas Instruments recommends that these devices not be used in any production system because their\nexpected end-use failure rate still is undefined. Only qualified production devices are to be used.\nTI device nomenclature also includes a suffix with the device family name. This suffix indicates the package type\n(for example, GLZ), the temperature range (for example, blank is the default commercial temperature range),and the device speed range in megahertz (for example, -6E3 is 600-MHz CPU, 133-MHz EMIFA). Figure 5provides a legend for reading the complete device name for any TMS320C64x ™ DSP generation member.\nThe ZLZ package, like the GLZ package, is a 532-pin plastic BGA only with lead-free soldered balls.

This source\nclock either drives the PLL, which multiplies the source clock frequency to generate the internal CPU clock, or\nbypasses the PLL to become the internal CPU clock.\nTo use the PLL to generate the CPU clock, the external PLL filter circuit must be properly designed. Figure 6\nshows the external PLL circuitry for either x1 (PLL bypass) or other PLL multiply modes.\nTo minimize the clock jitter, a single clean power supply should power both the C64x ™ DSP device and the\nexternal clock oscillator circuit.

If power measurements are to be performed when in a power-down mode, the emulator cable\nshould be removed.\nWhen the DSP is in power-down mode PD2 or PD3, emulation logic will force any emulation execution\ncommand (such as Step or Run) to spin in IDLE. For this reason, PC writes (such as loading code) will fail. A DSP\nreset will be required to get the DSP out of PD2/PD3.\npower-supply sequencing \nTI DSPs do not require specific power sequencing between the core supply and the I/O supply. However,systems should be designed to ensure that neither supply is powered up for extended periods of time(>1 second) if the other supply is below the proper operating voltage.\npower-supply design considerations\nA dual-power supply with simultaneous sequencing can be used to eliminate the delay between core and I/O\npower up. A Schottky diode can also be used to tie the core rail to the I/O rail (see Figure 11).\nTMS320C6414, TMS320C6415, TMS320C6416\nFIXED-POINT DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS\nSPRS146N − FEBRUARY 2001 − REVISED MAY 2005\n73 POST OFFICE BOX 1443 • HOUSTON, TEXAS 77251 −1443DVDD\nCVDD\nVSSC6000\nDSPSchottky\nDiodeI/O Supply\nCore Supply\nGND\nFigure 11. Schottky Diode Diagram\nCore and I/O supply voltage regulators should be located close to the DSP (or DSP array) to minimize\ninductance and resistance in the power delivery path. Additionally, when designing for high-performanceapplications utilizing the C6000 ™ platform of DSPs, the PC board should include separate power planes for\ncore, I/O, and ground, all bypassed with high-quality low-ESL/ESR capacitors.\npower-supply decoupling \nIn order to properly decouple the supply planes from system noise, place as many capacitors (caps) as possibleclose to the DSP. Assuming 0603 caps, the user should be able to fit a total of 60 caps, 30 for the core supply\nand 30 for the I/O supply. These caps need to be close to the DSP power pins, no more than 1.25 cm maximumdistance to be effective. Physically smaller caps, such as 0402, are better because of their lower parasiticinductance. Proper capacitance values are also important. Small bypass caps (near 560 pF) should be closest\nto the power pins. Medium bypass caps (220 nF or as large as can be obtained in a small package) should benext closest. TI recommends no less than 8 small and 8 medium caps per supply (32 total) be placedimmediately next to the BGA vias, using the “interior” BGA space and at least the corners of the “exterior”.\nEight larger caps (4 for each supply) can be placed further away for bulk decoupling. Large bulk caps (on the\norder of 100 µF) should be furthest away (but still as close as possible). No less than 4 large caps per supply\n(8 total) should be placed outside of the BGA.\nAny cap selection needs to be evaluated from a yield/manufacturing point-of-view. As with the selection of any\ncomponent, verification of capacitor availability over the product’s production lifetime should be considered.\nTMS320C6414, TMS320C6415, TMS320C6416\nFIXED-POINT DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS\nSPRS146N − FEBRUARY 2001 − REVISED MAY 2005\n74 POST OFFICE BOX 1443 • HOUSTON, TEXAS 77251 −1443IEEE 1149.1 JTAG compatibility statement \nThe TMS320C6414/15/16 DSP requires that both TRST  and RESET  be asserted upon power up to be properly\ninitialized. While RESET  initializes the DSP core, TRST  initializes the DSP’s emulation logic. Both resets are\nrequired for proper operation.\nNote: TRST  is synchronous and must  be clocked by TCLK; otherwise, BSCAN may not respond as expected\nafter TRST  is asserted.\nWhile both TRST  and RESET  need to be asserted upon power up, only RESET  needs to be released for the\nDSP to boot properly. TRST  may be asserted indefinitely for normal operation, keeping the JTAG port interface\nand DSP’s emulation logic in the reset state. TRST  only needs to be released when it is necessary to use a JTAG\ncontroller to debug the DSP or exercise the DSP’s boundary scan functionality. RESET  must be released in\norder for boundary-scan JTAG to read the variant field of IDCODE correctly. Other boundary-scan instructions\nwork correctly independent of current state of RESET .\nFor maximum reliability, the TMS320C6414/15/16 DSP includes an internal pulldown (IPD) on the TRST  pin\nto ensure that TRST  will always be asserted upon power up and the DSP’s internal emulation logic will always\nbe properly initialized. JTAG controllers from Texas Instruments actively drive TRST  high. However, some\nthird-party JTAG controllers may not drive TRST  high but expect the use of a pullup resistor on TRST . When\nusing this type of JTAG controller, assert TRST  to intialize the DSP after powerup and externally drive TRST\nhigh before attempting any emulation or boundary scan operations.\nFollowing the release of RESET , the low-to-high transition of TRST  must occur to latch the state of EMU1 and\nEMU0. The EMU[1:0] pins configure the device for either Boundary Scan mode or Normal/Emulation mode. For\nmore detailed information, see the terminal functions section of this data sheet.\nNote: The DESIGN_WARNING section of the TMS320C6414/15/16 BSDL file contains information and\nconstraints regarding proper device operation while in Boundary Scan Mode.\nEMIF device speed \nThe rated EMIF speed, referring to both EMIFA and EMIFB, of these devices only applies to the SDRAMinterface when in a system that meets the following requirements:\n−1 chip-enable (CE) space (maximum of 2 chips) of SDRAM connected to EMIF\n−up to 1 CE space of buffers connected to EMIF\n−EMIF trace lengths between 1 and 3 inches\n−166-MHz SDRAM for 133-MHz operation (applies only to EMIFA)\n−143-MHz SDRAM for 100-MHz operation\nOther configurations may be possible, but timing analysis must be done to verify all AC timings are met.\nVerification of AC timings is mandatory when using configurations other than those specified above. TIrecommends utilizing I/O buffer information specification (IBIS) to analyze all AC timings.\nTo properly use IBIS models to attain accurate timing analysis for a given system, see the Using IBIS Models\nfor Timing Analysis  application report (literature number SPRA839).\nTo maintain signal integrity, serial termination resistors should be inserted into all EMIF output signal lines (see\nthe Terminal Functions table for the EMIF output signals).\nTMS320C6414, TMS320C6415, TMS320C6416\nFIXED-POINT DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS\nSPRS146N − FEBRUARY 2001 − REVISED MAY 2005\n75 POST OFFICE BOX 1443 • HOUSTON, TEXAS 77251 −1443bootmode \nThe C6414/15/16 device resets using the active-low signal RESET . While RESET  is low, the device is held in\nreset and is initialized to the prescribed reset state. Refer to reset timing for reset timing characteristics andstates of device pins during reset. The release of RESET\n starts the processor running with the prescribed device\nconfiguration and boot mode.\nThe C6414/C6415/C6416 has three types of boot modes:\n/C0068Host boot\nIf host boot is selected, upon release of RESET , the CPU is internally “stalled” while the remainder of the\ndevice is released. During this period, an external host can initialize the CPU’s memory space as necessary\nthrough the host interface, including internal configuration registers, such as those that control the EMIF or\nother peripherals. For the C6414 device, the HPI peripheral is used for host boot. For the C6415/C6416device, the HPI peripheral is used for host boot if PCI_EN = 0, and the PCI peripheral is used for host boot if\nPCI_EN = 1. Once the host is finished with all necessary initialization, it must set the DSPINT bit in the HPIC\nregister to complete the boot process. This transition causes the boot configuration logic to bring the CPU\nout of the “stalled” state. The CPU then begins execution from address 0. The DSPINT condition is notlatched by the CPU, because it occurs while the CPU is still internally “stalled”. Also, DSPINT brings the CPU\nout of the “stalled” state only if the host boot process is selected. All memory may be written to and read bythe host. This allows for the host to verify what it sends to the DSP if required. After the CPU is out of the“stalled” state, the CPU needs to clear the DSPINT, otherwise, no more DSPINTs can be received.\n/C0068EMIF boot (using default ROM timings)\nUpon the release of RESET , the 1K-Byte ROM code located in the beginning of CE1  is copied to address 0\nby the EDMA using the default ROM timings, while the CPU is internally “stalled”. The data should be storedin the endian format that the system is using. In this case, the EMIF automatically assembles consecutive8-bit bytes to form the 32-bit instruction words to be copied. The transfer is automatically done by the EDMA\nas a single-frame block transfer from the ROM to address 0. After completion of the block transfer, the CPUis released from the “stalled” state and starts running from address 0.\n/C0068No boot\nWith no boot, the CPU begins direct execution from the memory located at address 0. Note: operation is\nundefined if invalid code is located at address 0.\nreset \nA hardware reset (RESET ) is required to place the DSP into a known good state out of power-up. The RESET\nsignal can be asserted (pulled low) prior to ramping the core and I/O voltages or after the core and I/O voltages\nhave reached their proper operating conditions. As a best practice, reset should be held low during power-up.Prior to deasserting RESET\n (low-to-high transition), the core and I/O voltages should be at their proper\noperating conditions and CLKIN should also be running at the correct frequency.\nTMS320C6414, TMS320C6415, TMS320C6416\nFIXED-POINT DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS\nSPRS146N − FEBRUARY 2001 − REVISED MAY 2005\n76 POST OFFICE BOX 1443 • HOUSTON, TEXAS 77251 −1443absolute maximum ratings over operating case temperature range (unless otherwise noted)† \nSupply voltage ranges: CV DD (see Note 1) − 0.3 V to 1.8 V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nDVDD (see Note 1) −0.3 V to 4 V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nInput voltage ranges: (except PCI), V I −0.3 V to 4 V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n(PCI), V IP [C6415 and C6416 only] −0.5 V to DV DD + 0.5 V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nOutput voltage ranges: (except PCI), V O −0.3 V to 4 V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n(PCI), V OP [C6415 and C6416 only] −0.5 V to DV DD + 0.5 V . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nOperating case temperature ranges, T C: (default) 0 /C0095C to 90 /C0095C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n(A version) [A-5E0, A-6E3] −40/C0095C to105 /C0095C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nStorage temperature range, T stg −65/C0095C to 150 /C0095C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n†Stresses beyond those listed under “absolute maximum ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device.

TI recommends utilizing the available I/O buffer information specification(IBIS) models to analyze the timing characteristics correctly. If needed, external logic hardware such as buf fers\nmay be used to compensate any timing differences.\nFor inputs, timing is most impacted by the round-trip propagation delay from the DSP to the external device and\nfrom the external device to the DSP.
