#### Description:
The AC221M050G165PTR is a hybrid conductive polymer capacitor designed for surface mount applications. It features low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and high ripple current capabilities, making it suitable for applications requiring efficient energy storage and delivery. The capacitor is rated for a maximum operating temperature of 125°C, which allows it to perform reliably in high-temperature environments.

#### Typical Applications:
This capacitor is typically used in:
- **Power Management:** For smoothing and filtering applications in power supplies.
- **Signal Processing:** In audio and RF circuits where low ESR is critical for performance.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Such as in power amplifiers, audio equipment, and other devices that require stable capacitance under varying load conditions.
- **Automotive Electronics:** Although not AEC-Q200 qualified, it can still be used in non-critical automotive applications due to its high temperature rating.

The AC221M050G165PTR is ideal for applications that demand high reliability and performance in compact designs, particularly in environments where heat dissipation is a concern.
