This attenuator requires no external biasing or RF matching components. \nMonotonic performance means the attenuation increases or \ndecreases as the applied DC voltage increases or decreases. This attenuator is comprised of four matched PIN diodes that terminate two ports of an internal matching network. \nThe diodes are biased using an external control voltage signal that \nsets the bias current through a resistive network. The attenuator operates with a control voltage range of 1 to 5 V and a 2 mA typical control current at maximum attenuation. As the control voltage increases, the bias current through each of the PIN diodes also increases.  \nThis increased bias current lowers the resistance of the PIN \ndiodes. Maximum attenuation occurs when the resistance of the PIN diodes is at maximum (control voltage of approximately 1 VDC). \nElectrical and Mechanical Specifications \nThe absolute maximum ratings of the SKY12239-11 are provided in Table 2. Electrical specifications are provided in Table 3. \nPerformance characteristics for the SKY12239-11 are illustrated \nin Figures 3 through 8. \n  \n \nTable 2.

### Component Summary: SKY12239-11

**Description:**
The SKY12239-11 is a voltage-controlled variable attenuator designed for broadband applications. It operates within a frequency range of 10 MHz to 1.5 GHz and is optimized for use in automatic power leveling and gain control circuits, particularly in cellular base stations and point-to-point radio IF chains. The device utilizes four matched PIN diodes and provides monotonic attenuation performance, meaning the attenuation level changes consistently with the applied control voltage.
