A\nmercury switch was used instead of an electronic switch to\nsimulate a noisy environment when the switch was being\nopened.\nWhen S\n1 is closed at t 0 the current in the inductor I L ramps\nup linearly; and energy is stored in the coil. At t 1 the switch\nis opened and the voltage across the diode under test begins\nto rise rapidly, due to di/dt ef fects, when this induced voltage\nreaches the breakdown voltage of the diode, it is clamped at\nBVDUT and the diode begins to conduct the full load current\nwhich now starts to decay linearly through the diode, and\ngoes to zero at t 2.\nBy solving the loop equation at the point in time when S 1\nis opened; and calculating the energy that is transferred to\nthe diode it can be shown that the total ener gy transferred is\nequal to the ener gy stored in the inductor plus a finite amount\nof energy from the V DD power supply while the diode is inbreakdown (from t 1 to t 2) minus any losses due to finite\ncomponent resistances. Assuming the component resistiveelements are small Equation (1) approximates the total\nenergy transferred to the diode. It can be seen from this\nequation that if the V\nDD voltage is low compared to the\nbreakdown voltage of the device, the amount of energy\ncontributed by the supply during breakdown is small and the\ntotal energy can be assumed to be nearly equal to the energy\nstored in the coil during the time when S 1 was closed,\nEquation (2).\nThe oscilloscope picture in Figure 8, shows the\nMUR8100E in this test circuit conducting a peak current of\none ampere at a breakdown voltage of 1300 V , and using\nEquation (2) the energy absorbed by the MUR8100E is\napproximately 20 mjoules.\nAlthough it is not recommended to design for this\ncondition, the new “E’’ series provides added protection\nagainst those unforeseen transient viruses that can produceunexplained random failures in unfriendly environments.\nWAVAL/C00911\n2LI2\nLPK/C0466BVDUT\nBVDUTVDD/C0467\nWAVAL/C00911\n2LI2\nLPK\nFigure 8.
