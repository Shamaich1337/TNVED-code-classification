Many\nembedded system designs utilizing PCI today can easily migrate to PCIe.  The\nExpressLane ™ PEX 8311 bridge can be used in Root Complex mode with the\ndevice directly interfacing multiple local bus devices including processors and\nFPGAs to a downstream PCIe port.  The bridge can also function in an EndPoint\ntype application connecting multiple local bus components to an upstream PCIe\nport.\nHigh ly Flexible, Gener ic Local  Bus \nThe PEX 8311 offers a highly flexible yet low overhead  generic  Local Bus \nwhich provides a direct connection to two generic indus try-standard \ninterconnect buses. The bus protocol can be set to the non-multiplexed \naddress  and data mode with up to 32-bit  transfers  “C-Mode”  or multiplexed \naddress/data  with up to 32-bit  transfers “J-Mode”.  This bus can be directl y \nconnected  to many proces sors with minimal or no glue logic.  Memor y, \nFPGAs,  FIFOs and other  devices  can be simultaneousl y placed  on this bus.  \nDual  Independent  DMA  Channels \nThe PEX 8311 provides two data transfer channels  each with internal \nindependent  programmable  FIFOs.  These channel s provide independe nt data  \ntransfers with the bridge initiating both the PCIe and local bus. With dual \nchannels,  data from two different  sources or bidirectional  traffic  can be \ntransferred  simultaneously  without  the need to finish  one transfer  before \nstarting  the second.  Each  DMA  channel  can use independent  scatte r-gather \ndescriptor  lists for increased  flexibility.  The use of DMA  descriptors  allows \nthe two channel s to look l ike multiple virtual DMA  channels. \nComplete  Conversion  from  PCI Express  Signaling \nThe PEX 8311 provides a co mplete local bus to PCIe translation. The bridge \nis equipped  with a standard  PCIe  port that operates  as a single  x1 link with a \nmaxi mum of 250 Megabytes per second of thr oughput per trans mit and  \nreceive  direc tions.  The single  2.5 Gbps  integrated  SerDes  delivers  the highest \nbandwidth  with the lowest  possible  pin-count.  The device supports  internal \nqueues with flow control features to opti mize throughput and t raffic flow.  \nRoot  Com plex and EndPoint  Modes \nThe PEX 83 11 bridge sup ports both R oot Complex a nd End Point modes of  \noperation.  This flexibili ty allows  a Root  Complex system designer  to utilize \nthe part as a type of “north bridge”  whereb y multiple  Local  Bus components \npresent  including  a processor,  FPGAs, memory, DSP,  etc., can communicate with \neach other  as well with downstre am PCIe devices.  In this case,  the bridg e’s \nconfiguratio n and system hierarch y come s through the Local Bu s. In End Point \nmode, the bridge i s confi gured thro ugh the PCIe port .\nPEX 8311 Version  1.2  2005 \nDirect Master  or Direct Slave Operation \nThe PEX  8311  bridge  provides  master (Upstre am traffic \ngeneration)  and slave  (Downstre am traffic acceptan ce) \ncapabilit y. These  trans fers can occur  simultaneousl y \nwith the DMA  transfers  and are given  priorit y. For \nmaster mode requests,  the bridge  services  local  bus \nmasters by generating  Upstre am traffic on the PCIe  side. \nThere  are two local  bus address  space maps to PCIe \n(Direct Master mode): one to memory and one to I/O \nwith the b ridge generating PCIe memory and I/O \ntransaction  types.  The bridge has independent  large \ndepth Read and Write FIFOs.  Read ahead and  \nprogrammable  read pre-fetch  counters  enhance \nperformance. Register configuration is through the PCIe \nport, Local Bus or through an opti onal EEPROM.  \nThe PEX 83 11 also suppo rts direct slave requests where \nthe bridge  services  PCIe  side Downstre am traffic \ninitiators  by mastering  the Local  Bus side. The bridge \nhas two general  purpose  address  spaces and one \nExpansion  ROM  space  that could  be used as a genera l \npurpose  direct  slave  space  map to the Local  Bus. Each \naddress  space may be configur ed for 8-, 16-, or 32-bit \nLocal  Bus data widths  for flexible  connectivi ty to Local \nBus devices.  Independent  Read  and Write  FIFOs  of large \ndepth p rovide buffering. P erformance is  enhanced  \nthrough deferred writes, posted writes, read ahead, and \nprogrammable  read pre-fetch  counters. \nHard ware DMA  Contro ls-EOT  /Demand Mode \nTo optimize data transfers in many applications, \nparticularl y communications,  the PEX 8311 supports \nhardware based control signals. When End of Transfer \n(EOT#)  is asserted,  the bridge  immedia tely terminates \nthe current  transfer  and indicates  the number of bytes \ntransferred. Along with  unlimited bursting capabili ty, \nEOT  is useful  in applications  where  the lengths  of the \nread packets  are not known until the packets  are read. \nAdditional h ardware signaling cont rol based DMA \ntransfers  are available.   \nWith  Demand Mode  each DMA  chann el has a pair of \nhardware  signals that are used to pause  and resume  the \ncurrent  transfer.  This allows  a peripheral  device  such as \na line card with its own FIFO  to control  DMA  transf ers. \nThis mode can be used on many non-FIFO  transfers  as \nwell in a variet y of end applications.   \nAdvanced  Performan ce Features \nThe PEX 8311  has a variety  of added  capabilities  which \nenhance  throughput  and flexibili ty for all transfer  types: \nDMA,  Direct Master  and Direct Slave.  These  include \nzero wait state l ocal bus bursts to 264 MB/s with \nprogrammable bur st lengt hs includin g unlimited \nbursting, deep FIFO for maxi mum PCIe packet  generation,  unaligned  Local Bus transfers  of any byte \nlength, on-the-fly Local Bu s Endian co nversion, \nprogrammab le Local  Bus wait states,  and Local  Bus parity \nchecking.  General  purpose  messaging  for proprieta ry \nmessage schemes include:  eight  32-bit  registers  for \npolled t opologies and t wo 32-bit  doorbell regi sters for \ninterrupt dr iven environ ments. \nFully Com pliant Power Management \nFor applicati ons that requi re power management, the  \nPEX 8311  device supports  both l ink (L0, L0s, L1, L2/L3 \nRead y, and L3) and devic e (D0, D1, D2 and D3) power \nmanag ement  states,  in compliance  with the PCIe  power \nmanagement  specification.  Full power management \nevent  packet s are generat ed and received  and translated \nto local bu s signaling.  \nPLX I/O Accelerator  Compatibilit y \nThe PEX  8311  is Register  compatible  with existing \nPLX’s bus mastering Local B us to PCI bridging \nsolutions (PLX PCI 9000 series). For many designs \nmigrating  from PCI to PCIe,  existing  code  utilizing  these \nI/O Accelera tors can be used.  As PCIe  and PCI are \ncompatible, designs can quickly be extended to take \nadvantage  of PCI Express ’ bandwidth,  system control, \nand data integri ty.  \nInternal  Block  Diagram \nFigure  1 below shows  an overview  of the PEX 8311 \nBridge. The device provides for full FIFO memory \nbuffers  for each DMA  channel and for Direct  Master and \nDirect  Slave  operation.  A complete three  layer PCIe \nprotocol  interface  with integrated  SerD es provides \nconversion from local bus data to/ from PCI Express port \ntransfers. M odules for Hot  Plug and  power management  \nare included.  Two serial  EEPROM  interfaces  allow  an \nadditional c onfiguratio n option.  \nApplications\nSuitable  for Root  Complex-centric  as well as EndPoint \nI/O applications,  the PEX  8311 can be configured  for a \nwide variety of form factors and applicati ons.

Such \ncontroller s often manage “ control  path”  data.  The local \nbus has the capabili ty to support  numerous simultaneous \nlocal  bus devices.  Figure  2 shows  the bridge  interfacing \na local  proce ssor, FPGA,  and memory to a downstrea m \nPCIe  port. The PCIe  port connects  to a switching  fabric \nor I/O card. \nFigure  2. “Northbrid ge” Host  Bridge \nLine Card  Application \nThe number and variet y of PCI Express  native -mode \ndevices  is growing  quickly.   As these  devices  become \nmainstrea m, it will be necessar y to create  multifunction \nand multi-port  adapter  cards  with PCI Express \ncapabilit y. \nThe PEX  8311  can be used to create  a communications \nline card that bridges  a local  processing  device  and \nmemory to an upstrea m PCIe  port. The bridge  allows  a \nline card to be a backplane  or a motherboard.  Figure  3 \nshows the PEX 8311 in this application.  In thi s mode, \nthe bridge act s in an “End Point mode”. Configurati on to \nthe bridge  comes  from the PCIe.  Use of DMA  for data \npath a nd higher priority simultaneous Direct \nMaster/Slave for control path data is invaluable. \nFigure  3.

Figure 4 illustrates PEX 8311 \nbridging programma ble logic devices to the PEX 8524 \nswitch.   One of the many applications  for the bridge  is to \ninterface  inputs  via an FPGA  from industrial  signals \nfrom the manufacturing  floor  to a PCIe  switch  where  the \ndata is sent to a local  processor  and then to a central  host \nfor system control  applications.  This use can be \ngeneralized  to many similar bridging  operations  such as \nin instrumentation or medical imaging. \nFigure  4. Industrial  Control \nIn this type application, the bridge’s  x1 lane PCIe 2.5 Gbps  \nbandwidth in combination  with its large  local bus capacitive \nloadi ng can  suppo rt up to five simultaneous input sources on\neach PEX 8311.  With  a Local Bus of up to 66 MHz and\n32-bit  data, complete bandwidth matching with the PCIe\nport can be achie ved in unidirectional designs.\nVideo Su rveillance System \nThe PEX 8311 is a very econo mical bridge and can  \nsupport many “mass market” application s. The se \napplicati ons include PC television  capture cards,  data \nacqui sition board s, video  editing,  and surveillance \nsystems.  The later is shown  in Figure  5 below.  This \ndesign  allows  multiple  camera  sources  to feed their \ninputs through a series of compression, buffering stages \nand local processing and be b ridged  to a PCIe  switch  or \ndirectl y to a PCIe  slot on a motherboard . The PC then \nallows security pe rsonnel to monitor multiple feeds and \nswitch  interactive ly among the various  feeds.
