They are based on a fixed-\nfrequency peak current-mode control topology. They\nare used in telecommunication, test and\nmeasurement, and medical applications with high\npower density and ease of use requirements. Low\nresistance switches allow up to 4-A continuous output\ncurrent at high ambient temperatures. The switching\nfrequency is externally adjustable from 1.8 MHz to 4\nMHz and can also be synchronized to an external\nclock in the same frequency range. In PFM/PWM\nmode, the TPSM8281x automatically enters Power\nSave Mode at light loads to maintain high efficiency\nacross the whole load range. The TPSM8281x\nprovides a 1% output voltage accuracy in PWM mode\nwhich helps design a power supply with high output\nvoltage accuracy. The SS/TR pin sets the start-up\ntime or tracks the output voltage to an external\nsource. This allows external sequencing of different\nsupply rails and limits the inrush current during start-\nup.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPSM82810 µSiL 3-mm x 4-mm x 2.4-mm\nTPSM82813 µSiL 3-mm x 4-mm x 2.4-mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the data sheet.\nSchematic\nEfficiency vs Output Current; V IN = 5 V;\nPFM; f S = 1.8 MHz; T A = 25°Cwww.ti.comTPSM82810, TPSM82813\nSLUSDN6A – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM82810  TPSM82813TPSM82810, TPSM82813\nSLUSDN6A – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The control loop is internally compensated. To optimize the bandwidth of the\ncontrol loop to the wide range of output capacitance that can be used with the TPSM8281x, one of three internal\ncompensation settings can be selected. See Section 9.3.3 . The compensation setting is selected either by a\nresistor from COMP/FSET to GND, or by the logic state of this pin. The regulation network achieves fast and\nstable operation with small external components and low-ESR ceramic output capacitors.\nThe devices support fixed-frequency forced PWM operation with the MODE/SYNC pin tied to a logic high level.\nWhen the MODE/SYNC pin is set to a logic low level, the device operates in power save mode (PFM) at low-\noutput currents and automatically transitions to fixed-frequency PWM mode at higher output currents. In PFM\nmode, the switching frequency decreases linearly based on the load to sustain high efficiency down to very low\noutput currents. The device can be synchronized to an external clock signal in a range from 1.8 MHz to 4 MHz\napplied to the MODE/SYNC pin.\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\n+\n-GND\nFBVOUT\nVIN\nEN\nOscillatorGate Drive and Control\nDevice\nControlPG\nThermal\n ShutdownBias\nRegulator\ngmIpeak\nVFB\nSS/TR\nCOMP/FSETMODEIzero+\n–\n+\n–470nHSW\nOutput\nDischargeRdis\n9.3 Feature Description\n9.3.1 Precise Enable (EN)\nThe TPSM8281x starts operation when the rising EN threshold is exceeded. For proper operation, the EN pin\nmust be terminated and must not be left floating. Pulling the EN pin low forces the device into shutdown. In this\nmode, the internal high-side and low-side MOSFETs are turned off and the entire internal control circuitry is\nswitched off. The voltage applied at the EN pin of the TPSM8281x is compared to a fixed threshold of 1.1 V for a\nrising voltage.\nThe enable input threshold for a falling edge is typically 100 mV lower than the rising edge threshold. The\nPrecise Enable input provides a user-programmable undervoltage lockout by adding a resistor divider to the\ninput of the EN pin. The Precise Enable input also allows you to drive the pin by a slowly changing voltage and\nenables the use of an external RC network to achieve a precise power-up delay. See the Achieving a Clean\nStart-up by Using a DC/DC Converter with a Precise Enable-pin Threshold Technical Brief  for more details.www.ti.comTPSM82810, TPSM82813\nSLUSDN6A – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM82810  TPSM82813\n9.3.2 Output Discharge\nThe purpose of the discharge function is to ensure a defined down-ramp of the output voltage when the device is\ndisabled and keep the output voltage close to 0 V when the device is off. The output discharge feature is only\nactive once the TPSM8281x has been enabled at least once since the supply voltage was applied. The\ndischarge function is enabled as soon as the device is disabled, in thermal shutdown, or in undervoltage lockout.\nThe minimum supply voltage required for the discharge function to remain active is typically 1 V.\n9.3.3 COMP/FSET\nThis pin sets two different parameters independently:\n• Internal compensation settings for the control loop (three settings available)\n• The switching frequency in PWM mode from 1.8 MHz to 4 MHz\nA resistor from COMP/FSET to GND changes the compensation as well as the switching frequency. The change\nin compensation adapts the device to different values of output capacitance. The resistor must be placed close\nto the pin to keep the parasitic capacitance on the pin to a minimum. The compensation setting is set after\nenabling the converter, so a change in the resistor during operation only has an effect on the switching frequency\nbut not on the compensation.\nTo save external components, the pin can also be directly tied to VIN or GND to set a pre-defined switching\nfrequency and compensation. Do not leave the pin floating.\nThe switching frequency must be selected based on the maximum input voltage and the output voltage to meet\nthe specifications for the minimum on-time. Using V IN = 5.5 V and V OUT = 1.1 V as an example, the minimum\nduty cycle given with Equation 1  is 0.2, which results in a maximum switching frequency of 2.67 MHz according\nto Equation 2 .\nOUT\nmin\nIN, maxVDV \n(1)\ns, max\non, min min1ft D  u\n(2)\nThe compensation range has to be chosen based on the minimum effective capacitance used. The capacitance\ncan be increased from the minimum value as given in Table 9-1  up to the maximum of 470 µF in all of the three\ncompensation ranges. If the capacitance of an output changes during operation, for example, when load\nswitches are used to connect or disconnect parts of the circuitry, the compensation has to be chosen for the\nminimum capacitance on the output. With large output capacitance, the compensation must be done based on\nthat large capacitance to get the best load transient response. Compensating for large output capacitance but\nplacing less capacitance on the output can lead to instability.\nThe switching frequency for the different compensation setting is determined by the following equations.\nFor compensation (comp) setting 1:\n18( )( )CF\nSMHz kR kf MHz/c215 /c87/c87 /c61\n(3)\nFor compensation (comp) setting 2:\n60( )( )CF\nSMHz kR kf MHz/c215 /c87/c87 /c61\n(4)\nFor compensation (comp) setting 3:TPSM82810, TPSM82813\nSLUSDN6A – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM82810  TPSM82813\n180( )( )CF\nSMHz kR kf MHz/c215 /c87/c87 /c61(5)\nTable 9-1.

If the\ncapacitance is distributed, a lower compensation setting can be required.\n9.3.4 MODE/SYNC\nWhen MODE/SYNC is set low, the device operates in PWM or PFM mode, depending on the output current. The\nMODE/SYNC pin forces PWM mode when set high. The pin also allows you to apply an external clock in a\nfrequency range from 1.8 MHz to 4 MHz for external synchronization. When an external clock is applied, the\ndevice operates in PWM mode. As with the switching frequency selection, the specification for the minimum on-\ntime has to be observed when applying the external clock signal. When using external synchronization, it is\nrecommended to set the internal switching frequency as set by R CF to a similar value as the externally applied\nclock. This ensures that, if the external clock fails, the switching frequency stays in the same range and the\nsettling time to the internal clock is reduced. When there is no resistor from COMP/FSET to GND, but the pin is\npulled high or low, external synchronization is not possible. An internal PLL allows you to change from an\ninternal clock to external clock during operation. The synchronization to the external clock is done on the falling\nedge of the applied clock to the rising edge of the internal SW pin. The MODE/SYNC pin can be changed during\noperation.\n9.3.5 Spread Spectrum Clocking (SSC) - TPSM8281xS\nThese devices offer spread spectrum clocking, where the switching frequency is randomly changed in PWM\nmode when the internal clock is used. The frequency variation is typically between the nominal switching\nfrequency and up to 288 kHz above the nominal switching frequency. When the device is externally\nsynchronized, the TPSM8281xS follows the external clock and the internal spread spectrum block is turned off.\nSSC is also disabled during soft start.\n9.3.6 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nIf the input voltage drops, the undervoltage lockout prevents mis-operation of the device by switching off both the\nMOSFETs. The device is fully operational for voltages above the rising UVLO threshold and turns off if the input\nvoltage goes below the falling threshold.www.ti.comTPSM82810, TPSM82813\nSLUSDN6A – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM82810  TPSM82813\n9.3.7 Power-Good Output (PG)\nThe device has a power good output with window comparator. The PG pin goes high impedance once the FB pin\nvoltage is above 95% and less than 107% of the nominal voltage, and is driven low once the voltage falls below\ntypically 90% or higher than 110% of the nominal voltage. Table 9-2  shows the typical PG pin logic. The PG pin\nis an open-drain output and is specified to sink up to 2 mA. The power good output requires a pullup resistor\nconnected to any voltage rail less than VIN. The PG signal can be used for sequencing of multiple rails by\nconnecting to the EN pin of other converters. If not used, the PG pin can be left floating or connected to GND.\nTable 9-2.

If T J exceeds 170°C\n(typ), the device goes into thermal shutdown. Both the high-side and low-side power FETs are turned off and PG\ngoes low. When T J decreases below the hysteresis amount of typically 15°C, the converter resumes normal\noperation, beginning with soft start. During PFM, the thermal shutdown is not active.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\n9.4.1 Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Operation\nThe TPSM8281x has two operating modes: Forced PWM mode and PFM/PWM mode.\nWith the MODE/SYNC pin set to high, the TPSM8281x operates with pulse width modulation in continuous\nconduction mode (CCM). The switching frequency is either defined by a resistor from the COMP/FSET pin to\nGND or by an external clock signal applied to the MODE/SYNC pin.\n9.4.2 Power Save Mode Operation (PFM/PWM)\nWhen the MODE/SYNC pin is low, power save mode is allowed. The device operates in PWM mode as long as\nthe peak inductor current is above the PFM threshold of about 1.2 A. When the peak inductor current drops\nbelow the PFM threshold, the device starts to skip switching pulses.TPSM82810, TPSM82813\nSLUSDN6A – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM82810  TPSM82813\nIn power save mode, the switching frequency decreases linearly with the load current to maintain high efficiency.\nThe linear behavior of the switching frequency in power save mode is shown in Figure 9-1 .\nFigure 9-1. Switching frequency versus Output Current (V IN = 5 V, V OUT = 1.8 V)\n9.4.3 100% Duty-Cycle Operation\nThe device offers a low input-to-output voltage differential by entering 100% duty cycle mode. When the\nminimum off-time of typically 30 ns is reached, the TPSM8281x skips switching cycles while it approaches 100%\nmode. In 100% mode, the high-side MOSFET switch is constantly turned on. This is particularly useful in battery-\npowered applications to achieve longest operation time by taking full advantage of the whole battery voltage\nrange. The minimum input voltage to maintain a minimum output voltage is given by:\nVIN (min) = V OUT (min) + IOUT × R DP (6)\nwhere\n• R DP is the resistance from V IN to V OUT, which includes the high-side MOSFET on-resistance and DC\nresistance of the inductor\n• V OUT (min) is the minimum output voltage the load can accept\n9.4.4 Current Limit and Short Circuit Protection\nThe TPSM8281x is protected against overload and short circuit events. If the inductor current exceeds the\ncurrent limit I LIMH, the high-side MOSFET is turned off and the low-side MOSFET is turned on to ramp down the\ninductor current. The high-side MOSFET turns on again only if the current in the low-side MOSFET has\ndecreased below the low-side current limit. Due to internal propagation delays, the actual current can exceed the\nstatic current limit. The dynamic current limit is given as:\n( )L\npeak typ LIMH PDVI I tL/c61 /c43 /c215\n(7)\nwhere\n• I LIMH is the static current limit, as specified in the electrical characteristics\n• L is the effective inductance (typically 470 nH)\n• V L is the voltage across the inductor (V IN - VOUT)\n• t PD is the internal propagation delay of typically 50 ns\nThe dynamic peak current is calculated as follows:\n( ) 50IN OUT\npeak typ LIMHV VI I nsL/c45/c61 /c43 /c215\n(8)www.ti.comTPSM82810, TPSM82813\nSLUSDN6A – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM82810  TPSM82813\nThe low-side MOSFET also contains a negative current limit to prevent excessive current from flowing back\nthrough the inductor to the input. If the low-side sinking current limit is exceeded, the low-side MOSFET is turned\noff. In this scenario, both MOSFETs are off until the start of the next cycle. The negative current limit is only\nactive in Forced PWM mode.\n9.4.5 Soft Start / Tracking (SS/TR)\nThe internal soft-start circuitry controls the output voltage slope during start-up. This avoids excessive inrush\ncurrent and ensures a controlled output voltage rise time. It also prevents unwanted voltage drops from high\nimpedance power sources or batteries. When EN is set high, the device starts switching after a delay of about\n200 μs. Then V OUT rises with a slope controlled by an external capacitor connected to the SS/TR pin.\nA capacitor connected from SS/TR to GND is charged with 2.5 µA by an internal current source during soft start\nuntil it reaches the reference voltage of 0.6 V. After reaching 0.6 V, the SS/TR pin voltage is clamped internally\nwhile the SS/TR pin voltage keeps rising to a maximum of about 3.3 V. The capacitance required to set a certain\nramp-time (t ramp) is:\n(9)\nLeaving the SS/TR pin un-connected provides the fastest start-up ramp of 150 µs typically. If the device is set to\nshutdown (EN = GND), undervoltage lockout, or thermal shutdown, an internal resistor pulls the SS/TR pin to\nGND to ensure a proper low level. Returning from those states causes a new start-up sequence.\nA voltage applied at the SS/TR pin can also be used to track a master voltage. The output voltage follows this\nvoltage in both directions up and down in forced PWM mode. In PFM mode, the output voltage decreases based\non the load current. An external voltage applied on SS/TR is internally clamped to the feedback voltage (0.6 V).\nIt is recommended to set the final value of the external voltage on SS/TR to be slightly above 0.6 V to make sure\nthe device operates with its internal reference voltage when the power-up sequencing is finished.

TI’s customers are responsible for determining\nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n10.1 Application Information\nThe TPSM8281x are synchronous step-down converter power modules. The required power inductor is\nintegrated inside the TPSM8281x. The inductor is shielded and has an inductance of 470 nH with approximately\na ±20% tolerance. The TPSM82810 and TPSM82813 are pin-to-pin and BOM-to-BOM compatible, differing only\nin their rated output current.\n10.2 Typical Application\nFigure 10-1.

Choose resistors R1 and R2 to set the output voltage within\na range of 0.6 V to 5.5 V according to Equation 10 . To keep the feedback (FB) net robust from noise, set R2\nequal to or lower than 100 k Ω to have at least 6 µA of current in the voltage divider. Lower values of FB resistors\nachieve better noise immunity, and lower light load efficiency, as explained in the Design Considerations for a\nResistive Feedback Divider in a DC/DC Converter Technical Brief .\nOUT OUT\nFBV V R1 R2 1 R2 1V 0.6V§ · § ·  u \x10  u \x10¨ ¸ ¨ ¸ © ¹ © ¹ \n(10)\n10.2.2.2 Feedforward capacitor\nA feedforward capacitor (C FF) is recommended in parallel with R 1 in order to improve the transient response.\nRegardless of the FB resistor values, the C FF value should always be 10 pF.www.ti.comTPSM82810, TPSM82813\nSLUSDN6A – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM82810  TPSM82813\n10.2.2.3 Input Capacitor\nFor most applications, a 22-µF nominal ceramic capacitor is recommended. The input capacitor buffers the input\nvoltage for transient events and also decouples the converter from the supply. A X7R or X7T multilayer ceramic\ncapacitor (MLCC) is recommended for best filtering and must be placed between VIN and GND as close as\npossible to those pins. For applications with ambient temperatures below 85°C, a capacitor with X5R dielectric\ncan be used. Ceramic capacitors have a DC-Bias effect, which has a strong influence on the final effective\ncapacitance. Choose the right capacitor carefully in combination with considering its package size and voltage\nrating. The minimum required input capacitance is 5 µF.\n10.2.2.4 Output Capacitor\nThe architecture of the TPSM8281x allows the use of ceramic output capacitors which have low equivalent\nseries resistance (ESR). These capacitors provide low output voltage ripple and are recommended. To keep its\nlow resistance up to high frequencies and to get a narrow capacitance variation with temperature, it is\nrecommended to use an X7R or X7T dielectric. At temperatures below 85°C, an X5R dielectric can be used.\nUsing a higher capacitance value has advantages like smaller voltage ripple and a tighter DC output accuracy in\npower save mode. By changing the device compensation with a resistor from COMP/FSET to GND, the device\ncan be compensated in three steps based on the minimum capacitance used on the output. The maximum\ncapacitance is 470 µF in any of the compensation settings. The minimum capacitance required on the output\ndepends on the compensation setting and output voltage as shown in Table 9-1 . For output voltages below 1 V,\nthe minimum required capacitance increases linearly from 32 µF at 1 V to 53 µF at 0.6 V with the compensation\nsetting for smallest output capacitance. Other compensation settings scale the same. Ceramic capacitors have a\nDC-Bias effect, which has a strong influence on the final effective capacitance. Choose the right capacitor\ncarefully in combination with considering its package size and voltage rating.TPSM82810, TPSM82813\nSLUSDN6A – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM82810  TPSM82813\n10.2.2.5 Application Curves\nTA = 25°C, V IN = 5 V, V OUT = 1.8 V, 1.8 MHz, PWM mode, BOM = Table 8-1  unless otherwise noted.\nVIN = 3.3 V PFM TA = 25°C\nFigure 10-2.

Start-Up Timing\n10.3 System Examples\n10.3.1 Voltage Tracking\nThe SS/TR pin is externally driven by another voltage source to achieve output voltage tracking. The application\ncircuit is shown in Figure 10-21 . From 0 V to 0.6 V, the internal reference voltage to the internal error amplifier\nfollows the SS/TR pin voltage. When the SS/TR pin voltage is above 0.6 V, the voltage tracking is disabled and\nthe FB pin voltage is regulated at 0.6 V. The device achieves ratiometric or coincidental (simultaneous) output\ntracking, as shown in Figure 10-22 .\nThe R2 value should be set properly to achieve accurate voltage tracking by taking the 2.5- μA charging current\ninto account. 1 k Ω or smaller is a sufficient value for R2. For decreasing SS/TR pin voltage, the device does not\nsink current from the output when the device is in PFM mode. The resulting decrease of the output voltage can\nbe slower than the SS/TR pin voltage if the load is light. When driving the SS/TR pin with an external voltage, do\nnot exceed the voltage rating of the SS/TR pin which is VIN+0.3 V.\nVout1 Vout2\nSS/TR FBR1\nR2R3\nR4TPSM8281x\nFigure 10-21.

There is no need for any\nadditional circuitry. See Figure 10-23 . The clock can be applied, changed, and removed during operation. The\nvalue of the R CF resistor is recommended to be chosen such that the internally defined frequency and the\nexternally-applied frequency are close to each other in order to have a fast settling time to the external clock.\nSynchronizing to a clock is not possible, if the COMP/FSET pin is connected to Vin or GND.

The output current of the\ninput power supply needs to be rated according to the supply voltage, output voltage, and output current of the\nTPSM8281x.\n12 Layout\n12.1 Layout Guidelines\nA proper layout is critical for the operation of any switched mode power supply, especially at high switching\nfrequencies. Therefore, the PCB layout of the TPSM8281x demands careful attention to ensure best\nperformance. A poor layout can lead to issues like bad line and load regulation, instability, increased EMI\nradiation, and noise sensitivity. Refer to the Five Steps to a Great PCB Layout for a Step-Down Converter\nTechnical Brief  for a detailed discussion of general best practices. Specific recommendations for the device are\nlisted below.\n• The input capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the VIN and GND pins of the device. This is the\nmost critical component placement. Route the input capacitor directly to the VIN and GND pins avoiding vias.\n• Place the output capacitor ground close to the VOUT and GND pins and route it directly avoiding vias.\n• Place the FB resistors, R1 and R2, and the feedforward capacitor C FF close to the FB pin and place C SS\nclose to the SS/TR pin to minimize noise pickup.\n• Place the R CF resistor close to the COMP/FSET pin to minimize the parasitic capacitance.\n• The recommended layout is implemented on the EVM and shown in its TPSM82810EVM-089 Evaluation\nModule User\'s Guide  and in Section 12.2 .\n• The recommended land pattern for the TPSM8281x is shown at the end of this data sheet. For best\nmanufacturing results, it is important to create the pads as solder mask defined (SMD), when some pins\n(such as VIN, VOUT, and GND) are connected to large copper planes. Using SMD pads keeps each pad the\nsame size and avoids solder pulling the device during reflow.\n12.2 Layout Example\nVIN VOUT\nGNDENPGMODE\nVINVOUT\nGNDGND\nCOMPSS/TRFBR1\nR2CFF\nCINCOUT\nFigure 12-1.

The following are\nthree basic approaches for enhancing thermal performance:\n• Improve the power dissipation capability of the PCB design.\n• Improve the thermal coupling of the component to the PCB.\n• Introduce airflow into the system.TPSM82810, TPSM82813\nSLUSDN6A – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM82810  TPSM82813\nTo estimate the approximate module temperature of the TPSM8281x, apply the typical efficiency stated in this\ndata sheet to the desired application condition to compute the power dissipation of the module.
