The product name“ADSP-21061” is used throughout this data sheet \nto represent all devices, except where expressly noted.\nADSP-21061 /ADSP-21061L\nRev. D | Page 3 of 52 | May 2013GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADSP-21061 SHARC—Super Harvard Architecture Com-\nputer—is a signal processing microcomputer that offers new \ncapabilities and levels of  performance. The ADSP-21061 \nSHARC is a 32-bit processor op timized for high performance \nDSP applications. The ADSP-21061 builds on the ADSP-21000 \nDSP core to form a complete system-on-a-chip, adding a dual-ported on-chip SRAM and integr ated I/O peripherals supported \nby a dedicated I/O bus.\nFabricated in a high speed, low power CMOS process, the \nADSP-21061 has a 20 ns instructio n cycle time and operates at \n50 MIPS. With its on-chip instru ction cache, the processor can \nexecute every instruction in a single cycle. Table 1  shows perfor-\nmance benchmarks for the ADSP-21061/ADSP-21061L.\nThe ADSP-21061 SHARC represents a new standard of integra-\ntion for signal computers, combining a high performance \nfloating-point DSP core with integrated, on-chip system fea-\ntures including 1M bit SRAM memory, a host processor interface, a DMA controller, seri al ports, and parallel bus con-\nnectivity for glueless DSP multiprocessing.\nThe ADSP-21061 continues SHARC’ s industry-leading stan-\ndards of integration for DSPs, combining a high performance \n32-bit DSP core with integrated, on-chip system features. \nThe block diagram on Page 1 , illustrates the following architec-\ntural features:\n• Computation units (ALU, multiplier, and shifter) with a \nshared data register file\n• Data address generators (DAG1, DAG2)\n• Program sequencer with instruction cache\n• PM and DM buses capable of supporting four 32-bit data \ntransfers between me mory and the core at every core pro-\ncessor cycle\n•I n t e r v a l  t i m e r•O n - c h i p  S R A M• External port for interfacing to off-chip memory and \nperipherals\n• Host port and multiprocessor interface• DMA controller•S e r i a l  p o r t s\n• JTAG test access port\nSHARC FAMILY CORE ARCHITECTURE\nThe ADSP-21061 includes the follo wing architectural features \nof the ADSP-21000 family core . The ADSP-21061 processors \nare code- and function-compa tible with the ADSP-21020, \nADSP-21060, and ADSP-21062 SHARC processors. \nIndependent, Parallel Computation Units\nThe arithmetic/logic unit (ALU),  multiplier, and shifter all per-\nform single-cycle instructions. The three units are arranged in \nparallel, maximizing computatio nal throughput. Single multi-\nfunction instructions execute pa rallel ALU and multiplier oper-\nations. These computation units support IEEE 32-bit single-\nprecision floating-point, extended-precision 40-bit floating-point, and 32-bit fixed-point data formats.\nData Register File\nA general-purpose data register file  is used for transferring data \nbetween the computation units and the data buses, and for stor-\ning intermediate results. This 10-port, 32-register (16 primary, \n16 secondary) register file, combined with the ADSP-21000 \nHarvard architecture, allows unconstrained data flow between \ncomputation units and internal memory.Table 1.

D | Page 4 of 52 | May 2013ADSP-21061 /ADSP-21061L\nSingle-Cycle Fetch of Instruction and Two Operands\nThe ADSP-21061 features an enhanc ed Harvard architecture in \nwhich the data memory (DM) bu s transfers data and the pro-\ngram memory (PM) bus transfer s both instructions and data \n(Figure 1 on Page 1 ). With its separate program and data mem-\nory buses and on-chip instruct ion cache, the processor can \nsimultaneously fetch two operands and an instruction (from the \ncache), all in a single cycle.\nInstruction Cache\nThe ADSP-21061 includes an on-c hip instructio n cache that \nenables three-bus operation for fe tching an instruction and two \ndata values. The cache is select ive—only the instructions whose \nfetches conflict with PM bus data accesses are cached. This \nallows full-speed execution of co re, looped operations such as \ndigital filter multiply-accumulat es and FFT butterfly processing.\nData Address Generators with  Hardware Circular Buffers\nThe ADSP-21061’s two data addre ss generators (DAGs) imple-\nment circular data buffers in hardware. Circular buffers allow \nefficient programming of delay li nes and other data structures \nrequired in digital signal proce ssing, and are commonly used in \ndigital filters and Fourier tran sforms. The two DAGs of the \nADSP-21061 contain sufficient regist ers to allow the creation of \nup to 32 circular buffers (16 pr imary register sets, 16 secondary). \nThe DAGs automatically handle address pointer wraparound, \nreducing overhead, increasing performance and simplifying implementation. Circular buffers  can start and end at any mem-\nory location.\nFlexible Instruction Set\nThe 48-bit instruction word acco mmodates a variety of parallel \noperations, for concise programming. For example, the\nADSP-21061 can conditionally ex ecute a multiply, an add, a \nsubtract, and a branch, all in a single instruction.\nMEMORY AND I/O INTERFACE FEATURES\nThe ADSP-21061 processors add the following architectural \nfeatures to the SHARC family core.\nDual-Ported On-Chip Memory\nThe ADSP-21061 contains one mega bit of on-chip SRAM, orga-\nnized as two blocks of 0.5M bits each. Each bank has eight 16-bit columns with 4k 16-bi t words per column. Each memory block \nis dual-ported for single-cycle, independent accesses by the core \nprocessor and I/O processor or DMA controller. The dual-ported memory and separate on-chip buses allow two data \ntransfers from the core and one from I/O, all in a single cycle \n(see Figure 4  for the ADSP-21061 memory map).\nOn the ADSP-21061, the memory ca n be configured as a maxi-\nmum of 32k words of 32-bit data , 64k words for 16-bit data, 16k \nwords of 48-bit instructions (and  40-bit data) or combinations \nof different word sizes up to 1 megabit. All the memory can be \naccessed as 16-bit, 32-bit, or 48-bit.A 16-bit floating-point storage format is supported, which effec-\ntively doubles the amount of data that may be stored on-chip. \nConversion between the 32-bit floating-point and 16-bit float-ing-point formats is done in a single instruction.\nWhile each memory block can st ore combinations of code and \ndata, accesses are most efficien t when one block stores data, \nusing the DM bus for transfers,  and the other block stores \ninstructions and data, using the PM bus for transfers. Using the \nDM bus and PM bus in this way, with one dedicated to each \nmemory block, assures single-c ycle execution with two data \ntransfers. In this ca se, the instruction must be available in the \ncache. Single-cycle execution is also maintained when one of the \ndata operands is transferred to or from off-chip, via the \nADSP-21061’s external port.\nOff-Chip Memory and Peripherals Interface\nThe ADSP-21061’s external port pr ovides the processor’s inter-\nface to off-chip memory and pe ripherals. The 4-gigaword off-\nchip address space is includ ed in the ADSP-21061’s unified \naddress space. The separate on-chip buses—for program mem-\nory, data memory, and I/O—are mu ltiplexed at the external port \nto create an external system bus with a single 32-bit address bus \nand a single 48-bit (or 32-bit) da ta bus. The on-chip Super Har-\nvard Architecture provides th ree-bus performance, while the \noff-chip unified address space gives flexibility to the designer.\nAddressing of external memory devices is facilitated by on-chip \ndecoding of high order address lines to generate memory bank \nselect signals. Separa te control lines are also generated for sim-\nplified addressing of page -mode DRAM. The ADSP-21061 \nprovides programmable memory wait states and external mem-\nory acknowledge controls to a llow interfacing to DRAM and \nperipherals with variable ac cess, hold, and disable time \nrequirements.\nHost Processor Interface\nThe ADSP-21061’s host interface allows easy connection to \nstandard microprocessor buses, both 16-bit and 32-bit, with lit-\ntle additional hardware required. Asynchronous transfers at \nspeeds up to the full clock rate of the processor are supported. \nThe host interface is accesse d through the ADSP-21061’s exter-\nnal port and is memory-mapped into the unified address space. \nTwo channels of DMA are available for the host interface; code and data transfers are accomp lished with low software \noverhead.\nThe host processor requests the ADSP-21061’s external bus \nwith the host bus request (HBR\n), host bus grant (HBG ), and \nready (REDY) signals. The host can directly read  and write the \ninternal memory of the ADSP -21061, and can access the DMA \nchannel setup and mailbox register s. Vector interrupt support is \nprovided for efficient exec ution of host commands.\nDMA Controller\nThe ADSP-21061’s on-chip DMA controller allows zero-\noverhead data transfers withou t processor intervention. The \nDMA controller operates indepe ndently and invisibly to the \nprocessor core, allowing DMA operations to occur while the core is simultaneously executing its program instructions. \nADSP-21061 /ADSP-21061L\nRev. D | Page 5 of 52 | May 2013DMA transfers can occur between  the ADSP-21061’s internal \nmemory and either external memory, external peripherals, or a \nhost processor. DMA transfer s can also occur between the \nADSP-21061’s internal memory and its serial ports. DMA transfers between external memory and external periph-\neral devices are another option. External bus packing to 16-,   \n32-, or 48-bit words is perf ormed during DMA transfers.Figure 3.

D | Page 6 of 52 | May 2013ADSP-21061 /ADSP-21061L\nSix channels of DMA are avai lable on the ADSP-21061—four \nvia the serial ports, and two via th e processor’s external port (for \neither host processor, othe r ADSP-21061s, memory or I/O \ntransfers). Programs can be downloaded to the ADSP-21061 \nusing DMA transfers. Asynchrono us off-chip peripherals can \ncontrol two DMA channels us ing DMA request/grant lines \n(DMAR 1–2, DMAG 1–2). Other DMA features  include interrupt \ngeneration upon completion of DMA transfers and DMA \nchaining for automatic linked DMA transfers.\nSerial Ports\nThe ADSP-21061 features  two synchronous se rial ports that \nprovide an inexpensive interface to a wide variety of digital and mixed-signal peripheral devices. The serial ports can operate at \nthe full clock rate of the processor, providing each with a maxi-\nmum data rate of up to 50 Mb ps. Independent transmit and \nreceive functions provide greater flexibility for serial communi-\ncations. Serial port data can be  automatically transferred to and \nfrom on-chip memory via DMA. Each of the serial ports offers TDM multichannel mode.The serial ports can operate with little-endian or big-endian \ntransmission formats, with word lengths sele ctable from 3 bits \nto 32 bits. They offer selectable synchronization and transmit modes as well as optional μ-law or A-law companding. Serial \nport clocks and frame syncs can be internally or externally gen-\nerated. The serial ports also include keyword and key mask features to enhance interprocessor communication.\nMultiprocessing\nThe ADSP-21061 offers powerful fe atures tailored to multipro-\ncessor DSP systems. The un ified address space (see Figure 4 ) \nallows direct interprocessor accesses of each ADSP-21061’s \ninternal memory. Distributed bus arbitration logic is included \non-chip for simple, glueless conn ection of systems containing \nup to six ADSP-21061s and a host  processor. Master processor \nchangeover incurs only one cycle of overhead. Bus arbitration is \nselectable as either fixed or ro tating priority. Bus lock allows \nindivisible read-modify-write se quences for semaphores. A vec-\ntor interrupt is provided for interprocessor commands. Maxi-\nmum throughput for interprocesso r data transfer is 500 Mbps \nover the external port. Broadc ast writes allo w simultaneous \ntransmission of data  to all ADSP-21061s and can be used to \nimplement reflective semaphores.\nFigure 4.

D | Page 7 of 52 | May 2013Program Booting\nThe internal memory of the AD SP-21061 can be booted at sys-\ntem power-up from either an 8-bit EPROM, or a host processor. \nSelection of the boot source  is controlled by the BMS  (boot \nmemory select), EBOOT (EPROM boot), and LBOOT (host boot) pins. 32-bit and 16-bit host  processors can be used for \nbooting. \nPORTING CODE FROM THE ADSP-21060 OR \nADSP-21062\nThe ADSP-21061 is pin compat ible with the ADSP-21060/ \nADSP-21061/ADSP-21062 proce ssors. The ADSP-21061 pins \nthat correspond to the link port pins of the ADSP-21060/ \nADSP-21062 are no-connects.\nThe ADSP-21061 is object co de compatible with the \nADSP-21060/ADSP-21062 processors  except for the following \nfunctional elements:\n• The ADSP-21061 memory is or ganized into two blocks \nwith eight columns that are 4k deep per block. The \nADSP-21060/ADSP-21062 memory has 16 columns per block.\n• Link port functions are not available.\n• Handshake external port DMA pins DMAR2 and DMAG2 \nare assigned to external port DMA Channel 6 instead of Channel 8.\n• 2-D DMA capability of the SPORT is not available.• The modify registers in SPORT DMA are not \nprogrammable.\nOn the ADSP-21061, Block 0 starts at the beginnin g of internal \nmemory, normal word address 0x0002 0000. Block 1 starts at \nthe end of Block 0, with contig uous addresses.  The remaining \naddresses in internal memory are divided into blocks that alias \ninto Block 1. This allows any code or data stored in Block 1 on the ADSP-21062 to retain th e same addresses on the \nADSP- 21061—these addresses will al ias into the actual Block 1 \nof each processor.\nIf you develop your applicatio n using the ADSP-21062, but will \nmigrate to the ADSP-21061, use on ly the first eight columns of \neach memory bank. Limit your appl ication to 8k of  instructions \nor up to 16k of data in each bank of the ADSP-21062, or any \ncombination of instructions or data that does not exceed the \nmemory bank.\nDEVELOPMENT TOOLS\nAnalog Devices supports its proce ssors with a complete line of \nsoftware and hardware development tools, including integrated \ndevelopment environments (which include CrossCore® Embed-\nded Studio and/or VisualDSP++®), evaluation products, \nemulators, and a wide vari ety of software add-ins.\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs)\nFor C/C++ software writing and editing, code generation, and \ndebug support, Analog Devices offers two IDEs.

For more information visit www.analog.com  and \nsearch on “Blackfin software modules” or “SHARC software \nmodules”.\nDesigning an Emulator-Compatible DSP Board (Target)\nFor embedded system test and de bug, Analog Devices provides \na family of emulators. On each  JTAG DSP, Analog Devices sup-\nplies an IEEE 1149.1 JTAG Test Access Port (TAP). In-circuit \nemulation is facilitated by use of this JTAG interface. The emu-\nlator accesses the processor’s internal features via the \nprocessor’s TAP, allowing the de veloper to load code, set break-\npoints, and view variables, memory, and registers. The \nprocessor must be halted to se nd data and commands, but once \nan operation is completed by the emulator, the DSP system is set \nto run at full speed with no im pact on system timing. The emu-\nlators require the target board to  include a header that supports \nconnection of the DSP’s JTAG port to the emulator.\nFor details on target board desi gn issues including mechanical \nlayout, single processor connections, signal buffering, signal ter-\nmination, and emulator pod logic, see the EE-68: Analog Devices \nJTAG Emulation Technical Reference  on the Analog Devices \nwebsite ( www.analog.com )—use site search on “EE-68.” This \ndocument is updated regularly to  keep pace with improvements \nto emulator support.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThis data sheet provides a ge neral overview of the ADSP-21061 \narchitecture and functionality. For detailed information on the \nADSP-21000 Family core architectu re and instruction set, refer \nto the ADSP- 2106x SHARC User’s Manual .RELATED SIGNAL CHAINS\nA signal chain  is a series of signal co nditioning electronic com-\nponents that receive input (data acquired from sampling either \nreal-time phenomena or from stor ed data) in tandem, with the \noutput of one portion of the ch ain supplying input to the next. \nSignal chains are often used in signal processing applications to gather and process data or to apply system controls based on \nanalysis of real-time phenomena. For more information about \nthis term and related topics, see the “signal chain” entry in the \nGlossary of EE Terms  on the Analog Devices website.\nAnalog Devices eases signal proc essing system development by \nproviding signal processing comp onents that are designed to \nwork together well. A tool fo r viewing relationships between \nspecific applications and related components is available on the \nwww.analog.com  website.\nThe Circuits from the Lab\nTM site ( www.analog.com/signal \nchains ) provides:\n• Graphical circuit block diagram presentation of signal \nchains for a variety of circuit types and applications\n• Drill down links for components  in each chain to selection \nguides and application information\n• Reference designs applying be st practice design techniques\nADSP-21061 /ADSP-21061L\nRev. D | Page 9 of 52 | May 2013PIN FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS\nADSP-21061 pin definitions are list ed below. All pins are identi-\ncal on the ADSP-21061 and ADSP- 21061L. Inputs identified as \nsynchronous (S) must meet timing  requirements with respect to \nCLKIN (or with respect to TCK for TMS, TDI). Inputs identi-\nfied as asynchronous (A) can be  asserted asynchronously to \nCLKIN (or to TCK for TRST ).Unused inputs should be tied or pulled to VDD or GND, except \nfor ADDR31-0, DATA47-0, FLAG3-0, SW , and inputs that have \ninternal pull-up or pu ll-down resistors (CPA , ACK, DTx, DRx, \nTCLKx, RCLKx, TMS, and TDI)—t hese pins can be left float-\ning. These pins have a logic-leve l hold circuit that prevents the \ninput from floating internally. \nTable 2. Pin Descriptions\nPin Type Function\nADDR 31–0 I/O/T External Bus Address.  The ADSP-21061 outputs addresses for external memory and peripherals on these \npins. In a multiprocessor system the bus master outputs addresses for read/write of the internal memory or \nIOP registers of other ADSP-21061s. The ADSP-21061 in puts addresses when a host processor or multipro-\ncessing bus master is reading or writin g its internal memory or IOP registers.\nDATA 47–0 I/O/T External Bus Data.  The ADSP-21061 inputs and outputs data and instructions on these pins. 32-bit single-\nprecision floating-point data and 32-bit fixed-point data is transferred over Bits 47 to 16 of the bus. 40-bit \nextended-precision floating-poi nt data is transferred over Bits 47 to 8 of the bus. 16-bit short word data is \ntransferred over Bits 31 to 16 of the bus. In PROM boot mode, 8-bit data is transferre d over Bits 23 to 16. Pull-\nup resistors on unused DATA pins are not necessary.\nMS 3–0 O/T Memory Select Lines. These lines are asserted (low) as chip sele cts for the corresponding banks of external \nmemory. Memory bank size must be defined in the ADSP-21061’s system control register (SYSCON). The \nMS 3–0 lines are decoded memory address lines that change  at the same time as the other address lines. \nWhen no external memory access is occurring the MS 3–0 lines are inactive; they are active however when a \nconditional memory access instruction is executed, whether or not the condition is true. MS 0 can be used \nwith the PAGE signal to implement a bank of DRAM memory (Bank 0). In a multiprocessing system the MS 3–0 \nlines are output by the bus master.\nRD I/O/T Memory Read Strobe. This pin is asserted (low) when the ADSP-21061 reads from external memory devices \nor from the internal memory of other ADSP-21061s. External devices (including other ADSP-21061s) must \nassert RD  to read from the ADSP-21061’s internal memory. In a multiprocessing system RD  is output by the \nbus master and is input by all other ADSP-21061s.\nWR I/O/T Memory Write Strobe.  This pin is asserted (low) when the ADSP-21061 writes to external memory devices \nor to the internal memory of other ADSP-21061s. External devices must assert WR  to write to the \nADSP-21061’s internal memory. In a multiprocessing system WR  is output by the bus master and is input by \nall other ADSP-21061s.\nPAGE O/T DRAM Page Boundary.  The ADSP-21061 asserts this pin to signal that an external DRAM page boundary \nhas been crossed. DRAM page size must be defined in the ADSP-21061’s memory control register (WAIT). \nDRAM can only be implemented in external memory Bank 0; the PAGE signal can only be activated for \nBank 0 accesses. In a multiprocessing system PAGE is output by the bus master.\nADRCLK O/T Clock Output Reference. In a multiprocessing system ADRC LK is output by the bus master.\nSW I/O/T Synchronous Write Select.  This signal is used to interface the ADSP-21061 to synchronous memory devices \n(including other ADSP-21061s) . The ADSP-21061 asserts SW  (low) to provide an early indication of an \nimpending write cycle, which can be aborted if WR  is not later asserted (e.g., in a conditional write \ninstruction). In a multiprocessing system, SW  is output by the bus master and is input by all other \nADSP-21061s to determine if the multiprocessor memory access is a read or write. SW  is asserted at the same \ntime as the address output. A host pr ocessor using synchronous writes must assert this pin when writing to \nthe ADSP-21061(s).\nA = Asynchronous, G = Ground, I = Input, O = Output, P = Power Supply, S = Synchronous, (A/D) = Active Drive, (O/D) = Open-Drai n, \nT = Three-State (when SBTS  is asserted, or when the ADSP-21061 is a bus slave)\nRev. D | Page 10 of 52 | May 2013ADSP-21061 /ADSP-21061L\nACK I/O/S Memory Acknowledge.  External devices can deassert ACK (low) to add wait states to an external memory \naccess. ACK is used by I/O devices, memory controllers , or other peripherals to ho ld off completion of an \nexternal memory access. The ADSP-21061 deasserts ACK as an output to add wait states to a synchronous \naccess of its internal memory. In a multiprocessing sy stem, a slave ADSP-21061 de asserts the bus master’s \nACK input to add wait state(s) to an access of its inte rnal memory. The bus master has a keeper latch on its \nACK pin that maintains the input at the level to which it was last driven.\nSBTS I/S Suspend Bus Three-State.  External devices can assert SBTS  (low) to place the external bus address, data, \nselects, and strobes in a high impedance state for the following cycle. If the ADSP-21061 attempts to access \nexternal memory while SBTS  is asserted, the processor halts and the memory access is not complete until \nSBTS  is deasserted. SBTS  should only be used to recover from ho st processor/ADSP-21061 deadlock, or used \nwith a DRAM controller.\nIRQ 2–0 I/A Interrupt Request Lines.  May be either edge-triggered or level-sensitive.\nFLAG 3–0 I/O/A Flag Pins.  Each is configured via control bits as either an in put or output. As an input,  they can be tested as \na condition. As an output, they can be  used to signal ex ternal peripherals.\nTIMEXP O Timer Expired.  Asserted for four cycles when the timer is enabled and TCOUNT decrements to zero.\nHBR I/A Host Bus Request.  This pin must be asserted by a host proc essor to request control of the ADSP-21061’s \nexternal bus. When HBR  is asserted in a multiprocessing system , the ADSP-21061 that is bus master will \nrelinquish the bus and assert HBG . To relinquish the bus, the ADSP-21061 places the address, data, select, \nand strobe lines in a high impedance state. HBR  has priority over all ADSP-21061 bus requests BR 6–1 in a \nmultiprocessing system.\nHBG I/O Host Bus Grant.  Acknowledges a bus request, indicating that the host processor may take control of the \nexternal bus. HBG  is asserted (held low) by the ADSP-21061 until HBR  is released. In a multiprocessing system, \nHBG  is output by the ADSP-21061 bus master and is monitored by all others.\nCS I/A Chip Select.  Asserted by host processor to select the ADSP-21061.\nREDY O (O/D) Host Bus Acknowledge.  The ADSP-21061 deasserts REDY (low) to add wait states to an asynchronous access \nof its internal memory or IOP registers by a host. This pin is an open-drain output (O/D) by default; it can be \nprogrammed in the ADREDY bit of the SYSCON register to  be active drive (A/D). REDY will only be output if \nthe CS  and HBR  inputs are asserted.\nDMAR 2–1 I/A DMA Request 1  (DMA Channel 7) and DMA Request 2  (DMA Channel 6). \nDMAG 2–1 O/T DMA Grant 1  (DMA Channel 7) and DMA Grant 2  (DMA Channel 6).\nBR6–1 I/O/S Multiprocessing Bus Requests.  Used by multiprocessing ADSP-21061  processors to arbitrate for bus \nmastership. An ADSP-21061 only drives its own BR x line (corresponding to the value of its ID2-0 inputs) and \nmonitors all others. In a multiprocessor system with less than six ADSP-21061s, the unused BR x pins should \nbe pulled high; the processor’s own BR x line must not be pulled high or low because it is an output.\nID2–0 O (O/D) Multiprocessing ID.  Determines which multiprocessing bus request (BR1 – BR6 ) is used by ADSP-21061. \nID = 001 corresponds to BR1 , ID = 010 corresponds to BR2 , etc., ID = 000 in single-processor systems. These \nlines are a system configuration selection which should be hardwi red or changed at reset only.\nRPBA I/S Rotating Priority Bus Arbitration Select. When RPBA is high, rotating pr iority for multiprocessor bus \narbitration is selected. When RPBA is low, fixed priori ty is selected. This signal is a system configuration \nselection which must be set to the same value on ever y ADSP-21061. If the value of RPBA is changed during \nsystem operation, it must be changed in the same CLKIN cycle on every ADSP-21061.\nCPA I/O (O/D) Core Priority Access. Asserting its CPA  pin allows the core processor of an  ADSP-21061 bus slave to interrupt \nbackground DMA transfers and gain access to the external bus.  CPA  is an open-drain output that is \nconnected to all ADSP-21061s in the system. The CPA  pin has an internal 5 k \uf057 pull-up resistor. If core access \npriority is not required in a system, the CPA  pin should be left unconnected.\nDTx O Data Transmit (Serial Ports 0, 1).  Each DT pin has a 50 k \uf057 internal pull-up resistor.\nDRx I Data Receive (Serial Ports 0, 1).  Each DR pin has a 50 k \uf057 internal pull-up resistor.\nTCLKx I/O Transmit Clock (Serial Ports 0, 1).  Each TCLK pin has a 50 k \uf057 internal pull-up resistor.\nRCLKx I/O Receive Clock (Serial Ports 0, 1).  Each RCLK pin has a 50 k \uf057 internal pull-up resistor.Table 2.

When EBOOT is high, the ADSP-21061 is co nfigured for booting fr om an 8-bit EPROM. \nWhen EBOOT is low, the LBOOT and BMS  inputs determine booting mode. See the table in the BMS  pin \ndescription below. This signal is a system co nfiguration selection that should be hardwired.\nLBOOT I Link Boot.  Must be tied to GND.\nBMS I/O/T* Boot Memory Select.  Output : Used as chip select for boot EPROM devices (when EBOOT = 1, \nLBOOT = 0). In a multiprocessor system, BMS  is output by the bus master. Input:  When low, indicates that no \nbooting will occur and that ADSP-21061 will begin executi ng instructions from external memory. See table \nbelow. This input is a system configuration selection that should be hardwired. *Three-statable only in \nEPROM boot mode (when BMS  is an output).\nEBOOT  LBOOT BMS Booting Mode\n1 0 Output EPROM (Connect BMS  to EPROM chip select.)\n0 0 1(Input) Host Processor.0 0 0 (Input) No Booting.

Resets the ADSP-21061 to a known state and begins program execution at the program \nmemory location specified by the ha rdware reset vector address.

D | Page 12 of 52 | May 2013ADSP-21061 /ADSP-21061L\nTARGET BOARD CONNECTOR FOR EZ-ICE PROBE\nThe ADSP-2106x EZ-ICE Emulator uses the IEEE 1149.1 JTAG \ntest access port of the ADSP-2106x to monitor and control the target board processor during emulation. The EZ-ICE probe \nrequires the ADSP-2106x’s CLKIN, TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO, and \nGND signals be made accessible on the target system via a \n14-pin connector (a 2-row, 7-pin strip header) such as that \nshown in Figure 5 . The EZ-ICE probe plugs directly onto this \nconnector for chip-on-board emulation. You must add this con-nector to your target board de sign if you intend to use the \nADSP-2106x EZ-ICE. The total tr ace length between the EZ-\nICE connector and the farthest de vice sharing the EZ-ICE JTAG \npin should be limited to 15 inches maximum for guaranteed \noperation. This length restriction must include EZ-ICE JTAG \nsignals that are routed  to one or more ADSP-2106x devices, or a \ncombination of ADSP-2106x devi ces and other JTAG devices \non the chain.\nThe 14-pin, 2-row pin strip header is keyed at the Pin 3 loca-\ntion—Pin 3 must be removed from  the header. The pins must be \n0.025 inch square and at least 0. 20 inches in length. Pin spacing \nshould be 0.1 \uf0b4 0.1 inches. Pin strip headers are available from \nvendors such as 3M, McKenzie, and Samtec. The BTMS, BTCK, BTRST\n, and BTDI signals are provid ed so that the test access \nport can also be used for board-level testing. \nWhen the connector is not bein g used for emulation, place \njumpers between the Bxxx pins and the xxx pins as shown in Figure 5 . If you are not going to use the test access port for \nboard testing, tie BTRST\n to GND and tie or pull up BTCK to \nVDD. The TRST  pin must be asserted (pulsed low) after power-\nup (through BTRST  on the connector) or held low for proper \noperation of the ADSP-2106x. None of the Bxxx pins (Pins 5, 7, \n9, and 11) are connected  on the EZ-ICE probe.The JTAG signals are terminated on the EZ-ICE probe as shown \nin Table 3 .\nFigure 6  shows JTAG scan path co nnections for systems that \ncontain multiple ADSP-2106x processors.\nConnecting CLKIN to Pin 4 of the EZ-ICE header is optional. \nThe emulator only uses CLKIN wh en directed to perform oper-\nations such as starting, stoppi ng, and single-stepping multiple \nADSP-2106xs in a synchronous ma nner. If you do not need \nthese operations to occur synchronously on the multiple proces-sors, simply tie Pin 4 of th e EZ-ICE header to ground.\nIf synchronous multiprocessor operations are needed and \nCLKIN is connected, clock skew between the multiple \nADSP-21061 processors and the CLKIN pin on the EZ-ICE \nheader must be minimal. If the skew is too large, synchronous \noperations may be off by one or more cycles between proces-\nsors. For synchronous multipro cessor operation TCK, TMS, \nCLKIN, and EMU\n should be treated as cr itical signals in terms \nof skew, and should be laid ou t as short as possible on your \nboard. If TCK, TMS, and CLKIN are driving a large number of \nADSP-21061s (more than eight) in your system, then treat them \nas a “clock tree” using multiple drivers to minimize skew. (See \nFigure 7  below and “JTAG Clock Tr ee” and “Clock Distribu-\ntion” in the “High Frequency Design Considerations” section of \nthe ADSP-2106x SHARC User’s Manual .) \nIf synchronous multiprocessor oper ations are not needed (i.e., \nCLKIN is not connected), just use appropriate parallel termina-tion on TCK and TMS. TDI, TDO, EMU,\n and TRST  are not \ncritical signals in terms of skew.Figure 5.

Internal power dissipation is dependent on the instruc-\ntion execution sequence and the data operands involved. \nInternal power dissipation is ca lculated in the following way: \nPINT  = I DDIN   \uf0b4\uf020VDD\nThe external component of total power dissipation is caused by \nthe switching of output pins. Its magnitude depends on: \n—the number of output pins th at switch during each cycle \n(O)\n—the maximum frequency at which they can switch (f)—their load capacitance (C)—their voltage swing (V\nDD)\nand is calculated by:\n                    PEXT = O \uf0b4 C \uf0b4 VDD2 \uf0b4 fThe load capacitance should in clude the processor’s package \ncapacitance (CIN). The switching frequency includes driving \nthe load high and then back low. Address and data pins can drive high and low at a maximum rate of 1/(2t\nCK). The write \nstrobe can switch every cy cle at a frequency of 1/t CK. Select pins \nswitch at 1/(2t CK), but selects can switch on each cycle.\nExample:  Estimate P EXT with the following assumptions:\n• A system with one bank of  external data memory RAM \n(32-bit)\n• Four 128k \uf0b4 8 RAM chips are used, each with a load of \n10 pF\n• External data memory writes occur every other cycle, a rate \nof 1/(4t CK), with 50% of the pins switching\n• The instruction cycl e rate is 40 MHz (t CK = 25 ns)\nThe P EXT equation is calculated for each class of pins that can \ndrive:\nA typical power consumption can now be calculated for these \nconditions by adding a typical internal power dissipation: P\nTOTAL  = P EXT  + (I DDIN2   \uf0b4  5.0 V)\nNote that the conditions causing a worst-case P EXT are different \nfrom those causing a worst-case P INT. Maximum P INT cannot \noccur while 100% of the output pi ns are switching from all ones \nto all zeros. Note also that it is not common for an application to \nhave 100% or even 50% of the outputs switching \nsimultaneously.Table 4.

For a \ncomplete listing of pr oduct availability, see Ordering Guide on \nPage 52 . TIMING SPECIFICATIONS\nThe timing specifications sh own are based on a CLKIN fre-\nquency of 50 MHz (t CK = 20 ns). The DT derating enables the \ncalculation of timing specifications within the min to max range \nof the t CK specification (see Table 7 ). DT is the difference \nbetween the derated CLKIN period (t CK) and a CLKIN period of \n25 ns:\n                                DT = t CK – 20 ns\nUse the exact timing information given. Do not attempt to \nderive parameters from the addition or subtraction of others. \nWhile addition or subtraction would yield meaningful results \nfor an individual device, the va lues given in this data sheet \nreflect statistical variations and worst cases. Consequently, you \ncannot meaningfully add parame ters to derive longer times.\nFor voltage reference levels, see Figure 29  under Test \nConditions.\nTiming Requirements  apply to signals that are controlled by cir-\ncuitry external to the processor, such as the data input for a read \noperation. Timing requirements  guarantee that the processor \noperates correctly with other devices. (O/D) = Open Drain, (A/D) = Active Drive.\nSwitching Characteristics  specify how the processor changes its \nsignals. You have no control over  this timing—circuitry external \nto the processor must be designed for compatibility with these signal characteristics. Switching characteristics tell you what the \nprocessor will do in a given ci rcumstance. You can also use \nswitching characteristics to ensu re that any timing requirement \nof a device connected to the processor (such as memory) is \nsatisfied.Parameter 5 V 3.3 V\nSupply Voltage (V DD) –0.3 V to +7.0 V –0.3 V to +4.6 V\nInput Voltage –0.5 V to V DD +0.5 V –0.5 V to V DD +0.5 V\nOutput Voltage Swing –0.5 V to V DD +0.5 V –0.5 V to V DD +0.5 V\nLoad Capacitance 200 pF 200 pF\nStorage Temperature Range –65 \uf0b0C to +150 \uf0b0C– 6 5 \uf0b0C to +150 \uf0b0C\nLead Temperature (5 seconds) 280 \uf0b0C2 8 0 \uf0b0C\nJunction Temperature Under Bias 130 \uf0b0C1 3 0 \uf0b0C\nFigure 8.

D | Page 43 of 52 | May 2013TEST CONDITIONS\nOutput Disable Time\nOutput pins are considered to be  disabled when they stop driv-\ning, go into a high impedance stat e, and start to decay from their \noutput high or low voltage. The time for the voltage on the bus \nto decay by \uf044V is dependent on the capacitive load, C L, and the \nload current, I L. This decay time can be  approximated by the \nfollowing equation:\nThe output disable time t DIS is the difference between \ntMEASURED  and t DECAY  as shown in Figure 27 . The time t MEASURED is \nthe interval from when the refere nce signal switches to when the \noutput voltage decays \uf044V from the measured output high or \noutput low voltage. t DECAY  is calculated with test loads C L and I L, \nand with \uf044V equal to 0.5 V.\nOutput Enable Time\nOutput pins are considered to be enabled when they have made \na transition from a high impedance state to when they start driv-\ning. The output enable time t ENA is the interval from when a \nreference signal reaches a high or  low voltage level to when the \noutput has reached a specified high or low trip point, as shown in the Output Enable/Disable diagram ( Figure 27 ). If multiple \npins (such as the data bus) ar e enabled, the measurement value \nis that of the first pin to start driving.\nExample System Hold Time Calculation\nTo determine the data output hold time in a particular system, first calculate t\nDECAY  using the equation given above. Choose \uf044V \nto be the difference between the ADSP-21061’s output voltage \nand the input threshold for the de vice requiring the hold time. A \ntypical \uf044V will be 0.4 V. C L is the total bus capacitance (per data \nline), and I L is the total leakage or th ree-state current (per data \nline). The hold time will be t DECAY  plus the minimum disable \ntime (i.e., t DATRWH  for the write cycle).Output Drive Characteristics\nFigure 30  through Figure 37  show typical char acteristics for the \noutput drivers of the ADSP-21061 (5 V) and ADSP-21061L \n(3 V). The curves represent the current drive capability and \nswitching behavior of the output drivers as a function of resistive and capacitive loading.\nCapacitive Loading\nOutput delays and holds are based on standard capacitive loads: \n50 pF on all pins (see Figure 28 ). The delay and hold specifica-\ntions given should be derated by  a factor of 1.5 ns/50 pF for \nloads other than the no minal value of 50 pF. Figure 31 , \nFigure 32 , Figure 35 , and Figure 36  show how output rise time \nvaries with capacitance. Figure 33  and Figure 37  show graphi-\ncally how output delays and hold s vary with load capacitance. \n(Note that this graph or derating does not apply to output dis-\nable delays; see the previous se ction Output Disable Time under \nTest Conditions.) The graphs of Figure 31 , Figure 32 , Figure 35 , \nand Figure 36  may not be linear outside the ranges shown.\nFigure 27.
