Its new DMOS topol-ogy provides significant improvement over previous designs,including low dropout voltage (only 230mV typ at full load),and better transient performance. In addition, no outputcapacitor is required for stability, unlike conventional lowdropout regulators that are difficult to compensate andrequire expensive low ESR capacitors greater than 1 µF.\nTypical ground pin current is only 1.7mA (at I\nOUT = 1A) and\ndrops to 0.5 µA in not enabled  mode. Unlike regulators with\nPNP pass devices, quiescent current remains relatively con-stant over load variations and under dropout conditions.\nThe REG104 has very low output noise (typically 33 µV\nRMS\nfor VOUT = 3.3V with CNR = 0.01µF), making it ideal for use\nin portable communications equipment. On-chip trimmingresults in high output voltage accuracy. Accuracy is main-tained over temperature, line, and load variations. Key pa-rameters are tested over the specified temperature range(–40°C to +85 °C).\nThe REG104 is well protected—internal circuitry provides a\ncurrent limit which protects the load from damage. Thermalprotection circuitry keeps the chip from being damaged byexcessive temperature. The REG104 is available in theDDPAK-5 and the SOT223-5.REG104REG104\nREG104\n(Fixed Voltage\nVersions)Enable\nGnd0.1µF COUT(1)++VOUT VIN\nNR\nNR = Noise Reduction\nNOTE: (1) Optional.REG104-A\nGndEnable\n0.1µF+COUT(1)+VOUT VIN\nR2R1\nAdjREG104\nSBVS025G – SEPTEMBER 2001 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2005\nwww.ti.comPRODUCTION DATA information is current as of publication date.\nProducts conform to specifications per the terms of Texas Instrumentsstandard warranty.

The family includes five fixed output versions(2.5V to 5.0V) and an adjustable output version. An internalDMOS power device provides low dropout regulation withnear constant ground pin current (largely independent of loadand dropout conditions) and very fast line and load transientresponse. All versions include internal current limit andthermal shutdown circuitry.\nFigure 1 shows the basic circuit connections for the fixed\nvoltage models. Figure 2 gives the connections for theadjustable output version (REG104A) and example resistorvalues for some commonly used output voltages. Values forother voltages can be calculated from the equation shown inFigure 2.\nFIGURE 1.

Enable Pin Equivalent Input Circuit.None of the versions require an output capacitor for regulator\nstability. The REG104 will accept any output capacitor typeless than 1 µF. For capacitance values larger than 1 µF the\neffective ESR should be greater than 0.1 Ω. This minimum\nESR value includes parasitics such as printed circuit boardtraces, solder joints, and sockets. A minimum 0.1 µF low ESR\ncapacitor connected to the input supply voltage is recom-mended.\nENABLE\nThe Enable pin allows the regulator to be turned on and off.This pin is active HIGH and compatible with standard TTL-CMOS levels. Inputs below 0.5V (max) turn the regulator offand all circuitry is disabled. Under this condition ground-pincurrent drops to approximately 0.5 µA.\nWhen not used, the Enable pin may be connected to V\nIN.\nInternal to the part, the Enable pin is connected to an inputresistor-zener diode circuit, as shown in Figure 3, creating anonlinear input impedance.\nREG1049\nSBVS025G0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001Enable Current ( µA)\nEnable Voltage\nFIGURE 4.

This reference is\nthe dominant noise source within the REG104. It generatesapproximately 45 µV\nRMS in the 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth at\nthe reference output. The regulator control loop gains up thereference noise, so that the noise voltage of the regulator isapproximately given by:\nVVRR\nRVV\nVN RMS RMSOUT\nREF=µ+=µ • 4524512The REG104 adjustable version does not have the noise-\nreduction pin available, however, the adjust pin is the\nsumming junction of the error amplifier. A capacitor, CFB,\nSBVS025GREG10410connected from the output to the adjust pin will reduce both\nthe output noise and the peak error from a load transient.Figure 7 shows improved output noise performance for twocapacitor combinations.\nFIGURE 7. Output Noise Density on Adjustable Versions.\nFIGURE 8. Transient and DC Dropout.For large step changes in load current, the REG104 requires\na larger voltage drop across it to avoid degraded transientresponse. The boundary of this \ntransient dropout  region is\nshown as the top line in Figure 8. Values of VIN to VOUT\nvoltage drop above this line insure normal transient re-sponse.\nIn the transient dropout region between \nDC and Transient,\ntransient response recovery time increases. The time re-quired to recover from a load transient is a function of boththe magnitude and rate of the step change in load currentand the available \nheadroom  VIN to VOUT voltage drop. Under\nworst-case conditions (full-scale load change with VIN to\nVOUT voltage drop close to DC dropout levels), the REG104\ncan take several hundred microseconds to re-enter thespecified window of regulation.\nTRANSIENT RESPONSE\nThe REG104 response to transient line and load conditionsimproves at lower output voltages. The addition of a capaci-tor (nominal value 10nF) from the output pin to ground mayimprove the transient response. In the adjustable version, theaddition of a capacitor, C\nFB (nominal value 10nF), from the\noutput to the adjust pin will also improve the transientresponse.\nTHERMAL PROTECTION\nPower dissipated within the REG104 will cause the junctiontemperature to rise. The REG104 has thermal shutdowncircuitry that protects the regulator from damage. The ther-mal protection circuitry disables the output when the junc-tion temperature reaches approximately 150 °C, allowing\nthe device to cool. When the junction temperature cools toapproximately 130 °C, the output circuitry is again enabled.\nDepending on various conditions, the thermal protectioncircuit may cycle on and off. This limits the dissipation of theregulator, but may have an undesirable effect on the load.\nAny tendency to activate the thermal protection circuit indi-\ncates excessive power dissipation or an inadequate heatsink. For reliable operation, junction temperature should belimited to 125 °C, maximum. To estimate the margin of safety\nin a complete design (including heat sink), increase theambient temperature until the thermal protection is triggered.Use worst-case loads and signal conditions. For good reli-ability, thermal protection should trigger more than 35 °C\nabove the maximum expected ambient condition of yourapplication. This produces a worst-case junction temperatureof 125°C at the highest expected ambient temperature and\nworst-case load.\nThe internal protection circuitry of the REG104 has been\ndesigned to protect against overload conditions. It was notintended to replace proper heat sinking. Continuously run-ning the REG104 into thermal shutdown will degrade reliabil-ity.\n250\n200150100\n50\n0Drop Out Voltage (mV)\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nIOUT (mA)REG104 –3.3 at 25 °C\nDC\nTransient100 10 1000 10000 10000010.0\n1.0\n0.1nV/√Hz\nFrequencyCOUT = 0, CFB = 0\nCOUT = 0, CFB = 0.01µF\nCOUT = 10µF, CFB = 0.01µF\nThe REG104 utilizes an internal charge pump to develop an\ninternal supply voltage sufficient to drive the gate of theDMOS pass element above V\nIN. The charge-pump switching\nnoise (nominal switching frequency = 2MHz) is not measur-able at the output of the regulator.\nDROP-OUT VOLTAGE\nThe REG104 uses an N-channel DMOS as the pass ele-\nment. When the input voltage is within a few hundred\nmillivolts of the output voltage, the DMOS device behaveslike a resistor. Therefore, for low values of V\nIN to VOUT, the\nregulator’s input-to-output resistance is the RdsON of the\nDMOS pass element (typically 230m Ω). For static (DC)\nloads, the REG104 will typically maintain regulation down toV\nIN to VOUT voltage drop of 230mV at full rated output current.\nIn Figure 8, the bottom line (DC dropout) shows the minimumV\nIN to VOUT voltage drop required to prevent dropout under\nDC load conditions.\nREG10411\nSBVS025GFIGURE 9. Maximum Power Dissipation versus Ambient\nTemperature for the Various Packages andPCB Heat Sink Configurations.POWER DISSIPATION\nThe REG104 is available in two different package configura-tions. The ability to remove heat from the die is different foreach package type and, therefore, presents different consid-erations in the printed circuit board (PCB) layout. The PCBarea around the device that is free of other componentsmoves the heat from the device to the ambient air. While itis difficult to impossible to quantify all of the variables in athermal design of this type, performance data for severalconfigurations are shown in Figure 9. In all cases the PCBcopper area is bare copper, free of solder resist mask, andnot solder plated. All examples are for 1-ounce copper. Usingheavier copper will increase the effectiveness in moving theheat from the device. In those examples where there iscopper on both sides of the PCB, no connection has beenprovided between the two sides. The addition of platedthrough holes will improve the heat sink effectiveness.\nPower dissipation depends on input voltage and load condi-\ntions. Power dissipation is equal to the product of the aver-age output current times the voltage across the outputelement, V\nIN to VOUT voltage drop.\nPVV IDI N OUT OUT AVG =•(–)()\nPower dissipation can be minimized by using the lowest\npossible input voltage necessary to assure the requiredoutput voltage.5\n43210Power Dissipation (Watts)\n0 25 50 75 125 100\nAmbient Temperature ( °C)CONDITIONS\n#1\n#2\n#3\n#4\nCONDITION PACKAGE PCB AREA θJA\n1 DDPAK 4in2 Top Side Only 27 °C/W\n2 SOT-223 4in2 Top Side Only 53 °C/W\n3 DDPAK None 65 °C/W\n4 SOT-223 0.5in2 Top Side Only 110 °C/W\nSBVS025GREG10412FIGURE 10.

Increasing the copper area improvesheat dissipation. Figure 10 shows typical thermal resistancefrom junction to ambient as a function of the copper area forthe DDPAK. Figure 11 shows the same relationship for theSOT-223.Although the tabs of the DDPAK and the SOT-223 are\nelectrically grounded, they are not intended to carry anycurrent. The copper pad that acts as a heat sink should beisolated from the rest of the circuit to prevent current flowthrough the device from the tab to the ground pin.
