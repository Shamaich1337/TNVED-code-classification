[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a technical specialist with expertise in electronics. Your task is to analyze datasheets for electronic components and provide a concise summary of the product’s key characteristics and specifications. In addition, you need to gather textual information about the component, including its description and typical applications.Instructions:    Identify the correct component in the datasheet using the provided product code.    Summarize key parameters, including:        Voltage ratings        Current ratings        Power consumption        Operating temperature range        Package type        Special features or notes (if applicable)        Moisture Sensetive Level JEDEC J-STD-020E    Provide a short description of the component, including what it is (e.g., transistor, microcontroller, sensor) and its primary function.    Explain typical applications for the component (e.g., power management, signal processing, data storage, etc.).    Be thorough and accurate: Ensure the information corresponds specifically to the product code, as some datasheets cover multiple variants.Your goal is to create a clear and accurate technical summary that includes both key specifications and a description of what the component is used for.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Give me information about the component of KNP100JB-73-2R production of YAGEO from the text:  \nProduct specification – November 10, 2023 V.3 \n \n \n \n \n DATA SHEET\nWIREWOUND  RESISTORS\nGeneral Purpose\nKNP Series\n±1%, ±2%, ±5% \n1/4W to 7W\nRoHS compliant & Halogen Free\n \n\n \n \nWireWound Resistors  \n \n \n \nProduct Specification\n \nKNP \n \nThrough Hole Resistors \n \nwww.yageo.com  \n \n Nov. 10, 2023   V.3 \n \n  \n \n \nAPPLICATIONS \n\uf09f Power applications \n\uf09f Home appliance \n\uf09f Industry \n \n \n \nFEATURES \n\uf09f Higher power rating \n\uf09f Wide resistance range \n\uf09f High stable performance and \nhigh reliability  \n\uf09f Flameproof coating equivalent \nto UL-94V-0 \n\uf09f RoHS compliant & halogen-\nfree  \nORDERING  INFORMATION \nPart number of the wirewound resistor is identified by the series, power \nrating, tolerance, packing, temperature coefficient, forming and \nresistance value and suffix. \n \nPART NUMBER \n \nKNP    2WS    J    T     -
