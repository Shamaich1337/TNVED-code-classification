The internal \npower switch is a DMOS-power MOSFET to provide power supply designs with high current capability, up to 3 A, \nand highly efficient operation.\nThe design support WEBENCH can also be used to provide instant component selection, circuit performance \ncalculations for evaluation, a bill of materials component list, and a circuit schematic for LM2676.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n* Active Inductor Patent Number 5,514,947 † Active Capacitor Patent Number 5,382,918\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Switch Output\nThis is the output of a power MOSFET switch connected directly to the input voltage. The switch provides energy \nto an inductor, an output capacitor, and the load circuitry under control of an internal pulse-width-modulator \n(PWM). The PWM controller is internally clocked by a fixed 260-kHz oscillator. In a standard step-down \napplication, the duty cycle (Time ON/Time OFF) of the power switch is proportional to the ratio of the power \nsupply output voltage to the input voltage. The voltage on pin 1 switches between V IN (switch ON) and below \nground by the voltage drop of the external Schottky diode (switch OFF).\n7.3.2 Input\nThe input voltage for the power supply is connected to pin 2. In addition to providing energy to the load, the input \nvoltage also provides bias for the internal circuitry of the LM2676. For ensured performance, the input voltage LM2676\nSNVS031M – APRIL 2000 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2676\nmust be in the range of 8 V to 40 V. For best performance of the power supply, the input pin must always be \nbypassed with an input capacitor located close to pin 2.\n7.3.3 C Boost\nA capacitor must be connected from pin 3 to the switch output, pin 1. This capacitor boosts the gate drive to the \ninternal MOSFET above V IN to fully turn it ON. This minimizes conduction losses in the power switch to maintain \nhigh efficiency. The recommended value for C Boost is 0.01 µF.\n7.3.4 Ground\nThis is the ground reference connection for all components in the power supply. In fast-switching, high-current \napplications such as those implemented with the LM2676, TI recommends that a broad ground plane be used to \nminimize signal coupling throughout the circuit.\n7.3.5 Feedback\nThis is the input to a two-stage high gain amplifier, which drives the PWM controller. It is necessary to connect \npin 6 to the actual output of the power supply to set the DC output voltage. For the fixed output devices (3.3-V, \n5-V, and 12-V outputs), a direct wire connection to the output is all that is required as internal gain setting \nresistors are provided inside the LM2676. For the adjustable output version, two external resistors are required \nto set the DC output voltage. For stable operation of the power supply, it is important to prevent coupling of any \ninductor flux to the feedback input.\n7.3.6 ON/OFF\nThis input provides an electrical ON/OFF control of the power supply. Connecting this pin to ground or to any \nvoltage less than 0.8 V completely turns OFF the regulator. The current drain from the input supply when OFF \nis only 50 µA. Pin 7 has an internal pullup current source of approximately 20 µA and a protection clamp Zener \ndiode of 7 V to ground. When electrically driving the ON/ OFF pin, the high voltage level for the ON condition \nmust not exceed the 6-V absolute maximum limit. When ON/OFF control is not required, pin 7 must be left open \ncircuited.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Shutdown Mode\nThe ON/ OFF pin provides electrical ON and OFF control for the LM2676. When the voltage of this pin is lower \nthan 1.4 V, the device is shutdown mode. The typical standby current in this mode is 45 µA.\n7.4.2 Active Mode\nWhen the voltage of the ON/ OFF pin is higher than 1.4 V, the device starts switching and the output voltage \nrises until it reaches a normal regulation voltage.\nwww.ti.comLM2676\nSNVS031M – APRIL 2000 – REVISED MAY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: LM2676\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\n8.1.1 Design Considerations\nPower supply design using the LM2676 is greatly simplified by using recommended external components. A \nwide range of inductors, capacitors, and Schottky diodes from several manufacturers have been evaluated for \nuse in designs that cover the full range of capabilities (input voltage, output voltage, and load current) of the \nLM2676. A simple design procedure using nomographs and component tables provided in this data sheet leads \nto a working design with very little effort.\nThe individual components from the various manufacturers called out for use are still just a small sample of \nthe vast array of components available in the industry. While TI recommends these components, they are not \nexclusively the only components for use in a design. After a close comparison of component specifications, \nequivalent devices from other manufacturers can be substituted for use in an application.\nThe following sections include important considerations for each external component and an explanation of how \nthe nomographs and selection tables were developed.\n8.1.2 Inductor\nThe inductor is the key component in a switching regulator. For efficiency, the inductor stores energy during the \nswitch ON time and then transfers energy to the load while the switch is OFF.\nNomographs are used to select the inductance value required for a given set of operating conditions. The \nnomographs assume that the circuit is operating in continuous mode (the current flowing through the inductor \nnever falls to zero). The magnitude of inductance is selected to maintain a maximum ripple current of 30% of the \nmaximum load current. If the ripple current exceeds this 30% limit, the next larger value is selected.\nThe inductors offered have been specifically manufactured to provide proper operation under all operating \nconditions of input and output voltage and load current. Several part types are offered for a given amount of \ninductance. Both surface mount and through-hole devices are available. The inductors from each of the three \nmanufacturers have unique characteristics:\n•Renco:\n–Ferrite stick core inductors\n–Typically has the lowest cost\n–Can withstand ripple and transient peak currents above the rated value\n–Have an external magnetic field, which can generate EMI\n•Pulse Engineering:\n–Powered iron toroid core inductors\n–Can withstand higher than rated currents\n–Because they are toroid inductors, they have low EMI.\n•Coilcraft:\n–Ferrite drum core inductors\n–Are the smallest physical size inductors\n–Are only available as surface mount components\n–Generate EMI, but less than stick inductorsLM2676\nSNVS031M – APRIL 2000 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2676\n8.1.3 Output Capacitor\nThe output capacitor acts to smooth the DC output voltage and also provides energy storage. Selection of an \noutput capacitor, with an associated equivalent series resistance (ESR), impacts both the amount of output ripple \nvoltage and stability of the control loop.\nThe output ripple voltage of the power supply is the product of the capacitor ESR and the inductor ripple current. \nThe capacitor types recommended in the tables were selected for having low ESR ratings.\nIn addition, both surface mount tantalum capacitors and through-hole aluminum electrolytic capacitors are \noffered as solutions.\nImpacting frequency stability of the overall control loop and the output capacitance, in conjunction with the \ninductor, creates a double pole inside the feedback loop. In addition, the capacitance and the ESR value create \na zero. These frequency response effects together, with the internal frequency compensation circuitry of the \nLM2676, modify the gain and phase shift of the closed-loop system.\nAs a general rule for stable switching regulator circuits, it is desired to have the unity gain bandwidth of the \ncircuit to be limited to no more than one-sixth of the controller switching frequency. With the fixed 260-kHz \nswitching frequency of the LM2676, the output capacitor is selected to provide a unity gain bandwidth of 40 kHz \n(maximum). Each recommended capacitor value has been chosen to achieve this result.\nIn some cases, multiple capacitors are required either to reduce the ESR of the output capacitor, to minimize \noutput ripple (a ripple voltage of 1% of V OUT or less is the assumed performance condition), or to increase \nthe output capacitance to reduce the closed-loop unity gain bandwidth to less than 40 kHz. When parallel \ncombinations of capacitors are required, it has been assumed that each capacitor is the exact same part type.\nThe RMS current and working voltage (WV) ratings of the output capacitor are also important considerations. In \na typical step-down switching regulator, the inductor ripple current (set to be no more than 30% of the maximum \nload current by the inductor selection) is the current that flows through the output capacitor. The capacitor \nRMS current rating must be greater than this ripple current. The voltage rating of the output capacitor must be \ngreater than 1.3 times the maximum output voltage of the power supply. If operation of the system at elevated \ntemperatures is required, the capacitor voltage rating can be de-rated to less than the nominal room temperature \nrating. Careful inspection of the manufacturer\'s specification for de-rating of working voltage with temperature is \nimportant.\n8.1.4 Input Capacitor\nFast changing currents in high current switching regulators place a significant dynamic load on the unregulated \npower source. An input capacitor helps provide additional current to the power supply and smooth out input \nvoltage variations.\nLike the output capacitor, the key specifications for the input capacitor are RMS current rating and working \nvoltage. The RMS current flowing through the input capacitor is equal to one-half of the maximum DC load \ncurrent so the capacitor must be rated to handle this. Paralleling multiple capacitors proportionally increases the \ncurrent rating of the total capacitance. The voltage rating must also be selected to be 1.3 times the maximum \ninput voltage. Depending on the unregulated input power source, under light load conditions, the maximum input \nvoltage can be significantly higher than normal operation. Consider this when selecting an input capacitor.\nThe input capacitor must be placed very close to the input pin of the LM2676. Due to relative high current \noperation with fast transient changes, the series inductance of input connecting wires or PCB traces can create \nringing signals at the input terminal which can possibly propagate to the output or other parts of the circuitry. It \ncan be necessary in some designs to add a small valued (0.1 µF to 0.47 µF) ceramic type capacitor in parallel \nwith the input capacitor to prevent or minimize any ringing.\n8.1.5 Catch Diode\nWhen the power switch in the LM2676 turns OFF, the current through the inductor continues to flow. The path \nfor this current is through the diode connected between the switch output and ground. This forward-biased diode \nclamps the switch output to a voltage less than ground. This negative voltage must be greater than –1 V so TI \nrecommends a low voltage drop (particularly at high current levels) Schottky diode. Total efficiency of the entire \nwww.ti.comLM2676\nSNVS031M – APRIL 2000 – REVISED MAY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: LM2676\npower supply is significantly impacted by the power lost in the output catch diode. The average current through \nthe catch diode is dependent on the switch duty cycle (D) and is equal to the load current times (1-D). Use of \na diode rated for much higher current than is required by the actual application helps minimize the voltage drop \nand power loss in the diode.\nDuring the switch ON time, the diode is reversed biased by the input voltage. The reverse voltage rating of the \ndiode must be at least 1.3 times greater than the maximum input voltage.\n8.1.6 Boost Capacitor\nThe boost capacitor creates a voltage used to overdrive the gate of the internal power MOSFET. This improves \nefficiency by minimizing the on-resistance of the switch and associated power loss. For all applications, TI \nrecommends a 0.01-µF, 50-V ceramic capacitor.\n8.1.7 Additional Application Information\nWhen the output voltage is greater than approximately 6 V and the duty cycle at minimum input voltage is \ngreater than approximately 50%, the designer must exercise caution in selection of the output filter components. \nWhen an application designed to these specific operating conditions is subjected to a current limit fault condition, \nit can be possible to observe a large hysteresis in the current limit. This can affect the output voltage of the \ndevice until the load current is reduced sufficiently to allow the current limit protection circuit to reset itself.\nUnder current limiting conditions, the LM267x is designed to respond in the following manner:\n1.At the moment when the inductor current reaches the current limit threshold, the ON-pulse is immediately \nterminated. This happens for any application condition.\n2.However, the current limit block is also designed to momentarily reduce the duty cycle to below 50% to avoid \nsubharmonic oscillations, which can cause the inductor to saturate.\n3.Thereafter, after the inductor current falls below the current limit threshold, there is a small relaxation time \nduring which the duty cycle progressively rises back above 50% to the value required to achieve regulation.\nIf the output capacitance is sufficiently large , it can be possible that as the output tries to recover. The output \ncapacitor charging current is large enough to repeatedly re-trigger the current limit circuit before the output has \nfully settled. This condition is exacerbated with higher output voltage settings because the energy requirement \nof the output capacitor varies as the square of the output voltage (½ CV2), thus requiring an increased charging \ncurrent.\nA simple test to determine if this condition can exist for a suspect application is to apply a short circuit across \nthe output of the converter, then remove the shorted output condition. In an application with properly selected \nexternal components, the output recovers smoothly.\nPractical values of external components that have been experimentally found to work well under these specific \noperating conditions are C OUT = 47 µF, L = 22 µH. Note that even with these components, for a current limit of \nICLIM of the device, the maximum load current under which the possibility of the large current limit hysteresis can \nbe minimized, is I CLIM / 2. For example, if the input is 24 V and the set output voltage is 18 V, then for a desired \nmaximum current of 1.5 A, the current limit of the chosen switcher must be confirmed to be at least 3 A.\nUnder extreme overcurrent or short-circuit conditions, the LM267x employs frequency foldback in addition to \nthe current limit. If the cycle-by-cycle inductor current increases above the current limit threshold (due to short \ncircuit or inductor saturation for example), the switching frequency is automatically reduced to protect the IC. \nFrequency below 100 kHz is typical for an extreme short-circuit condition.LM2676\nSNVS031M – APRIL 2000 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2676\n8.2 Typical Applications\n8.2.1 Typical Application for All Output Voltage Versions\nFigure 8-1.

The maximum load current is 2.5 A. Through-hole components are preferred.\nStep 1:  Operating conditions are:\n•VOUT = 3.3 V\n•VIN maximum = 16 V\n•ILOAD maximum = 2.5 A\nStep 2:  Select an LM2676T-3.3. The output voltage has a tolerance of ±2% at room temperature and ±3% over \nthe full operating temperature range.\nStep 3:  Use the nomograph for the 3.3-V device ( Figure 8-2 ). The intersection of the 16-V horizontal line (V IN \nmax) and the 2.5-A vertical line (I LOAD max) indicates that L33, a 22-µH inductor, is required.\nFrom Table 8-3 , L33 in a through-hole component is available from Renco with part number RL-1283-22-43 or \npart number PE-53933 from Pulse Engineering.\nStep 4:  Use Table 8-5  or Table 8-6  to determine an output capacitor. With a 3.3-V output and a 22-µH inductor, \nthere are four through-hole output capacitor solutions with the number of same type capacitors to be paralleled \nand an identifying capacitor code given. Table 8-1  or Table 8-2  provides the actual capacitor characteristics. Any \nof the following choices work in the circuit:\n•1 × 220-µF, 10-V Sanyo OS-CON (code C5)\n•1 × 1000-µF, 35-V Sanyo MV-GX (code C10)\n•1 × 2200-µF, 10-V Nichicon PL (code C5)\n•1 × 1000-µF, 35-V Panasonic HFQ (code C7)\nStep 5:  Use Table 8-7  or Table 8-8  to select an input capacitor. With a 3.3-V output and 22 µH, there are three \nthrough-hole solutions. These capacitors provide a sufficient voltage rating and an RMS current rating greater \nthan 1.25 A (1/2 I LOAD max). Again, using Table 8-1  or Table 8-2  for specific component characteristics, the \nfollowing choices are suitable:\n•1 × 1000-µF, 63-V Sanyo MV-GX (code C14)\n•1 × 820-µF, 63-V Nichicon PL (code C24)\n•1 × 560-µF, 50-V Panasonic HFQ (code C13)\nStep 6:  From Table 8-4 , a 3-A Schottky diode must be selected. For through-hole components, 20-V rated \ndiodes are sufficient and two part types are suitable:\n•1N5820\n•SR302\nStep 7:  A 0.01-µF capacitor is used for C BOOST .\n8.2.3.2.1 Capacitor Selection\nTable 8-5.

Basic Circuit for Adjustable Output Voltage Applications\n8.2.4.1 Design Requirements\nSelect the power supply operating conditions and the maximum output current and follow the following \nprocedures to find the external components for the LM2676.\n8.2.4.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nIn this example, it is desired to convert the voltage from a two battery automotive power supply (voltage range \nof 20 V to 28 V, typical in large truck applications) to the 14.8-VDC alternator supply typically used to power \nelectronic equipment from single battery 12-V vehicle systems. The load current required is 2 A (maximum). It is \nalso desired to implement the power supply with all surface mount components.\nStep 1:  Operating conditions are:\n•VOUT = 14.8 V\n•VIN max = 28 V\n•ILOAD max = 2 A\nStep 2:  Select an LM2676S-ADJ. To set the output voltage to 14.9 V, two resistors must be chosen (R1 and R2 \nin Figure 8-7 ). For the adjustable device, the output voltage is set by the following relationship:\n(1)\nwhere\n•VFB is the feedback voltage of typically 1.21 V\nA recommended value to use for R1 is 1 kΩ. In this example, R2 is determined to be:\n(2)\nR2 = 11.23 kΩ\nThe closest standard 1% tolerance value to use is 11.3 kΩ.\nThis sets the nominal output voltage to 14.88 V which is within 0.5% of the target value.\nStep 3:  Using the nomograph for the adjustable device ( Figure 8-5 ) requires a calculation of the inductor Volt × \nmicrosecond constant (E × T expressed in V × µS) from Equation 3 :\nwww.ti.comLM2676\nSNVS031M – APRIL 2000 – REVISED MAY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: LM2676\n(3)\nwhere\n•VSAT is the voltage drop across the internal power switch which is R ds(ON)  × ILOAD\nIn this example, this is typically 0.15 Ω × 2 A or 0.3 V and V D is the voltage drop across the forward biased \nSchottky diode, typically 0.5 V. The switching frequency of 260 kHz is the nominal value to use to estimate the \nON time of the switch during which energy is stored in the inductor.\nFor this example E × T is found to be:\n(4)\n(5)\nUsing Figure 8-5 , the intersection of 27 V × µS horizontally and the 2 A vertical line (I load max) indicates that L38, \na 68-µH inductor, must be used.\nFrom Table 8-3 , L38 in a surface mount component is available from Pulse Engineering with part number \nPE-54038S.\nStep 4:  Use Table 8-9  or Table 8-10  to determine an output capacitor. With a 14.8-V output, the 12.5 to 15 V row \nis used, and with a 68-µH inductor, there are three surface mount output capacitor solutions. Table 8-1  or Table \n8-2 provide the actual capacitor characteristics based on the C Code number. Any of the following choices can \nbe used:\n•1 × 33-µF, 20 V AVX TPS (code C6)\n•1 × 47-µF, 20 V Sprague 594 (code C8)\n•1 / 47-µF, 20 V Kemet T495 (code C8)\nNote\nWhen using the adjustable device in low voltage applications (less than 3-V output), if the nomograph \n(Figure 8-5 ) selects an inductance of 22 µH or less, Table 8-9  and Table 8-10  do not provide an \noutput capacitor solution. With these conditions, the number of output capacitors required for stable \noperation becomes impractical. TI recommends to use either a 33-µH or 47-µH inductor and the \noutput capacitors from Table 8-9  or Table 8-10 .\nStep 5:  An input capacitor for this example requires at least a 35-V WV rating with an RMS current rating of 1 A \n(1/2 I OUT max). From Table 8-1  or Table 8-2 , it can be seen that C12, a 33-µF, 35-V capacitor from Sprague, has \nthe required voltage and current rating of the surface mount components.\nStep 6:  From Table 8-4 , a 3-A Schottky diode must be selected. For surface mount diodes with a margin of \nsafety on the voltage rating one of five diodes can be used:\n•SK34\n•30BQ040\n•30WQ04F\n•MBRS340\n•MBRD340\nStep 7:  A 0.01-µF capacitor is used for C BOOST .LM2676\nSNVS031M – APRIL 2000 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2676\n8.2.4.2.1 Capacitor Selection\nTable 8-9.

This input supply must be well \nregulated and able to withstand maximum input current and maintain a stable voltage.\n8.4 Layout\n8.4.1 Layout Guidelines\nBoard layout is critical for the proper operation of switching power supplies. First, the ground plane area \nmust be sufficient for thermal dissipation purposes. Second, appropriate guidelines must be followed to reduce \nthe effects of switching noise. Switch mode converters are very fast switching devices. In such cases, the \nrapid increase of input current combined with the parasitic trace inductance generates unwanted L di/dt noise \nspikes. The magnitude of this noise tends to increase as the output current increases. This noise can turn into \nelectromagnetic interference (EMI) and can also cause problems in device performance. Therefore, take care in \nlayout to minimize the effect of this switching noise. The most important layout rule is to keep the AC current \nloops as small as possible. Figure 8-8  shows the current flow in a buck converter. The top schematic shows \na dotted line which represents the current flow during the top switch ON-state. The middle schematic shows \nthe current flow during the top switch OFF-state. The bottom schematic shows the currents referred to as ac \ncurrents. These AC currents are the most critical because they are changing in a very short time period. The \ndotted lines of the bottom schematic are the traces to keep as short and wide as possible. This also yields a \nsmall loop area reducing the loop inductance. To avoid functional problems due to layout, review the PCB layout \nexample. Best results are achieved if the placement of the LM2679 device, the bypass capacitor, the Schottky \ndiode, RFBB, RFBT, and the inductor are placed as shown in the example. Note that, in the layout shown, R1 \n= RFBB and R2 = RFBT. TI also recommends using 2-oz copper boards or heavier to help thermal dissipation \nand to reduce the parasitic inductances of board traces.
