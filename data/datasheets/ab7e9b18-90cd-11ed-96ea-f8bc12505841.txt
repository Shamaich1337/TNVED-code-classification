Tie to \nVOUT when V OUT > 3V or to another DC voltage greater \nthan 3V otherwise. When BIAS > 3V the internal circuitry will be powered from this pin to improve efficiency.

If the shutdown feature is not used, tie this pin to V\nIN.\nGND (Pins C2, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, E2, E3, E4, E5): The \nGND connections serve as the main signal return and the \nprimary heat sink for the L TM8020.

Return the feedback divider to this signal. \nADJ (Pin E1): The L TM8020 regulates its ADJ pin to 1.25V . \nConnect the adjust resistor from this pin to GND.

It can deliver up to \n200mA of DC output current with only bulk external input \nand output capacitors. This module provides a precisely regulated output voltage programmable via one external \nresistor from 1.25VDC to 5VDC. The input voltage range \nis 4V to 36V . Given that the L TM8020 is a step-down con\n-\nverter , make sure that the input voltage is high enough to support the desired output voltage and load current. See \nBlock Diagram.\nThe L TM8020 contains a current mode controller , power \nswitching element, power inductor , power Schottky diode \nand a modest amount of input and output capacitance. \nFor some applications, as shown in Table 1, no output capacitor is necessary.\nWith its high performance current mode controller and \ninternal feedback loop compensation, the L TM8020 module has sufficient stability margin and good transient perfor\n-\nmance under a wide range of operating conditions with a wide range of output capacitors, even all ceramic ones (X5R \nor X7R). Current mode control provides cycle-by-cycle fast \ncurrent limit, and automatic current limiting protects the module in the event of a short circuit or overload fault.The L TM8020 is built upon a variable frequency control\n-\nler . The on time, off time and switching frequency are dependent upon the input voltage, output voltage and \nload current.\nThe drive circuit for the internal power switching element \nis powered through the BIAS pin. Power this pin with at \nleast 3V .\nThe L TM8020 is equipped with two operating modes, \ndependant upon the load current. When the load current \nis sufficiently high, the L TM8020 will switch continuously \n(see Figure 1a). If the load is very light, or if the input voltage is high relative to the output voltage, the part will \noperate in Burst Mode\n® operation, alternating between its \nmicropower and switching states to keep the output in regulation and hold the power dissipation to a minimum \n(See Figure 1b). \nIf the SHDN pin is grounded, all internal circuits are turned \noff and V\nIN current reduces to the device leakage current, \ntypically a few nanoamps.\nFigure 1.

Look at Table 1 and find the row that has the desired \ninput range and output voltage.\n2. Apply the C IN, COUT, RADJ and BIAS connection indicated \non that row.\nWhile these component combinations have been tested for proper operation, it is incumbent upon the user to verify proper operation over the intended system’s line, load and \nenvironmental conditions.\nIf an output voltage other than those listed in Table 1 is \ndesired, use the equation R\nADJ = 623.75/(V OUT – 1.25), \nwhere R ADJ is in kW. As a starting point, use values for \nCIN and C OUT that correspond to the input voltage and \noutput voltage that most closely matches the intended \napplication, and verify proper operation over the system’s \nline, load and environmental conditions.\nCapacitor Selection Considerations\nThe C IN and C OUT capacitor values in Table 1 are the \nminimum recommended values for the associated oper -\nating conditions. Applying capacitor values below those \nindicated in Table 1 is not recommended, and may result \nin undesirable operation. An input system bulk capacitor \nis assumed. Using larger values is generally acceptable, and can yield improved dynamic response, if it is neces\n-\nsary. Again, it is incumbent upon the user to verify proper operation over the intended system’s line, load and envi\n-\nronmental conditions.\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However , not all ceramic capacitors are suitable. \nX5R and X7R types are stable over temperature and ap -\nplied voltage and give dependable service. Other types, including Y5V and Z5U have very large temperature and \nvoltage coefficients of capacitance. In an application cir\n-\ncuit they may have only a small fraction of their nominal \ncapacitance resulting in much higher output voltage ripple \nthan expected.\nCeramic capacitors are also piezoelectric. The L TM8020’s \nswitching frequency depends on the load current, and \nat light loads it can excite a ceramic capacitor at audio APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nfrequencies, generating audible noise. Since the L TM8020 \noperates at a lower current limit during Burst Mode opera -\ntion, the noise is typically very quiet to a casual ear .\nIf this audible noise is unacceptable, use a high performance \nelectrolytic capacitor at the output. The input capacitor can \nbe a parallel combination of a 2.2µF ceramic capacitor and a low cost electrolytic capacitor .\nA final precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns \nthe maximum input voltage rating of the L TM8020. A ceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable \ninductance forms a high Q (under damped) tank circuit. \nIf the L TM8020 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the input voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, possi\n-\nbly exceeding the device’s rating. This situation is easily avoided; see the Hot-Plugging Safely section.\nShorted Input Protection\nCare needs to be taken in systems where the output will be \nheld high when the input to the L TM8020 is absent. This \nmay occur in battery charging applications or in battery \nbackup systems where a battery or some other supply is diode ORed with the L TM8020’s output. If the V\nIN pin \nis allowed to float and the SHDN pin is held high (either \nby a logic signal or because it is tied to V IN), then the \nL TM8020’s internal circuitry will pull its quiescent current \nfrom its output. This is fine if your system can tolerate a \nfew milliamps in this state. If you ground the SHDN pin, \nthis quiescent current will drop to essentially zero. How -\never , if the V IN pin is grounded while the output is held \nhigh, then parasitic diodes inside the L TM8020 can pull \nlarge currents from the output through the internal power \nswitch, possibly damaging the device. Figure 2 shows a circuit that will run only when the input voltage is present \nand that protects against a shorted or reversed input.\nFigure 2. Diode D1 Prevents a Shorted Input from Discharging \na Backup Battery Tied to the Output, as Well as Protecting the L TM8020 from a Reversed InputVIN\nL TM8020\nSHDNVIN\n8020 F02GNDD1\n100k\n1M\nLTM80209\n8020fe For more information www.linear.com/LTM8020APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPCB Layout\nMost of the headaches associated with PCB layout have \nbeen alleviated or even eliminated by the high level of \nintegration of the L TM8020. The L TM8020 is never-the -\nless a switching power supply, and care must be taken to minimize EMI and ensure proper operation. Even with the \nhigh level of integration, you may fail to achieve specified \noperation with a haphazard or poor layout. See Figure 3 for a suggested layout.\nEnsure that the grounding and heat sinking are acceptable. \nA few rules to keep in mind are:\n1. Place the C\nIN capacitor as close as possible to the V IN \nand GND connection of the L TM8020.\n2. Place the C OUT capacitor as close as possible to the \nVOUT and GND connection of the L TM8020.\n3. Place the C IN and C OUT capacitors such that their \nground current flows directly adjacent or underneath \nthe L TM8020.\n4. Connect all of the GND connections to as large a copper \npour or plane area as possible on the top layer . Avoid \nbreaking the ground connection between the external \ncomponents and the L TM8020.\n5. The copper pours also serve as the heat sink for the \nL TM8020. Place several vias in the GND plane to act as \nheat pipes to other layers of the printed circuit board.Positive-to-Negative Voltage Regulation\nThe L TM8020 can generate a negative output by tying the \nVOUT pads to system ground and connecting GND as shown \nin the Typical Applications section. In this configuration, SHDN must be level shifted or referenced to GND, and the \navailable output current may be reduced.\nHot-Plugging Safely\nThe small size, robustness and low impedance of ceramic \ncapacitors make them an attractive option for the input bypass capacitor of L TM8020. However , these capacitors \ncan cause problems if the L TM8020 is plugged into a live \nsupply (see Linear Technology Application Note 88 for a complete discussion). The low loss ceramic capacitor \ncombined with stray inductance in series with the power \nsource forms an under damped tank circuit, and the volt\n-\nage at the V IN pin of the L TM8020 can ring to twice the \nnominal input voltage, possibly exceeding the L TM8020’s \nrating and damaging the part. If the input supply is poorly \ncontrolled or the user will be plugging the L TM8020 into an energized supply, the input network should be designed \nto prevent this overshoot. Figure 4 shows the waveforms \nthat result when an L TM8020 circuit is connected to a 24V supply through six feet of 24-gauge twisted pair . The first \nplot is the response with a 2.2µF ceramic capacitor at the \ninput. The input voltage rings as high as 35V and the input current peaks at 20A. One method of damping the tank \ncircuit is to add another capacitor with a series resistor to \nthe circuit. In Figure 4b an aluminum electrolytic capacitor has been added. This capacitor’s high equivalent series \nresistance damps the circuit and eliminates the voltage \novershoot. The extra capacitor improves low frequency ripple filtering and can slightly improve the efficiency of the \ncircuit, though it is likely to be the largest component in the \ncircuit. An alternative solution is shown in Figure 4c. A 1W resistor is added in series with the input to eliminate the \nvoltage overshoot (it also reduces the peak input current). \nA 0.1µF capacitor improves high frequency filtering. This solution is smaller and less expensive than the electrolytic \ncapacitor . For high input voltages its impact on efficiency \nis minor , reducing efficiency less than one-half percent for a 5V output at full load operating from 24V .\nFigure 3.

To estimate the junction temperature, ap\n-\nproximate the power dissipation within the L TM8020 by applying the typical efficiency stated in this data sheet to \nthe desired output power , or , if you have an actual module, \nby taking a power measurement. Then calculate the inter\n-\nnal temperature rise of the L TM8020 above the surface of the printed circuit board by multiplying the module’s \npower dissipation by the thermal resistance. The actual \nthermal resistance of the L TM8020 to the printed circuit board depends upon the layout of the circuit board, but the \nthermal resistance given in the Pin Configuration, which is \nbased upon a 25cm\n2 4-layer FR4 PC board, and the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics can be used a guide.Finally, be aware that at high ambient temperatures the internal Schottky diode will have significant leakage current \nincreasing the quiescent current of the L TM8020.\nBIAS Pin Considerations\nThe BIAS pin is used to provide drive power for the internal \npower switching stage and operate internal circuitry. For \nproper operation, it must be powered by at least 3V . If the output voltage is programmed to be 3V or higher , simply \ntie BIAS to V\nOUT. If V OUT is less than 3V , BIAS can be tied \nto V IN or some other voltage source. In all cases, ensure \nthat the maximum voltage at the BIAS pin is both less than 25V and the sum of V\nIN and BIAS is less than 47V . If BIAS \npower is applied from a remote or noisy voltage source, it may be necessary to apply a decoupling capacitor locally \nto the L TM8020.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 4.

For most applications at full load, the input needs to be at least 1.5V above the desired output. In \naddition, the input voltage required to turn on depends \nupon how the SHDN pin is tied. It takes more input voltage to turn on if SHDN is tied to V\nIN than if the turn-on is \ncontrolled by raising SHDN when V IN is in the required \noperating range.  A graph of the input voltage required to \nturn the L TM8020 on when SHDN is tied to V IN or when \nSHDN is switched is given in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.Electromagnetic Compliance\nThe L TM8020 was evaluated by an independent nationally \nrecognized test lab and found to be compliant with EN55022 class B: 2006 by a wide margin. A sample graph of the L TM8020’s radiated EMC performance is given in the Typical Performance Characteristics section, while further data, operating conditions and test setup are detailed in the electromagnetic compatibility test report, available on the Linear Technology website. Conducted emissions requirements may be met by adding an appropriate input power line filter . The proper implementation of this filter depends upon the system operating and performance conditions as a whole, of which the L TM8020 is typically only a component, so conducted emissions are not addressed at this level.\nLTM802012\n8020fe For more information www.linear.com/LTM8020VIN (V)00ILOAD  (mA)\n50100150200\n10 15 5 20 30 25\n8020 TA08250VIN VOUT\nL TM8020BIAS SHDN\n10µF\nX5R165k\n1%2.2µF\n–5VVIN*\n5V TO 30V\n8020 TA06ADJ GND –5V85mAOPTIONALSCHOTTKY\nCLAMP–5V Positive-to-Negative ConverterVIN VOUT\nL TM8020\nBIAS SHDN\n165k\n1%2.2µFVIN*\n6.5V TO 15V\n8020 TA05GND ADJVOUT\n5V\n200mA5V Step-Down Converter (No Output Capacitor Required)TYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nVIN VOUT\nL TM8020\nSHDN\n47µFX5R1µFV\nIN*\n4.5V TO 24V\n8020 TA02GND ADJVOUT\n1.25V200mA\nBIASVIN VOUT\nL TM8020\nBIAS SHDN\n10µFX5R\n301k1%1µFV\nIN*\n4.5V TO 36V\n8020 TA04GND ADJVOUT\n3.3V200mA1.25V Step-Down Converter 3.3V Step-Down Converter\nVIN VOUT\nL TM8020\nSHDN\nBIAS22µF\nX7R\n1.1M\n1%2.2µFVIN*\n4.5V TO 15V\n8020 TA03GND ADJVOUT\n1.8V\n200mA1.8V Step-Down Converter\n–5V Positive-to-Negative Converter \nOutput vs Input Voltage*\n* RUNNING VOL TAGE RANGE.
