Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: The LTC3130\n/LTC3130-1 is tested under pulsed load conditions \nsuch that T J ≈ TA. The LTC3130E/LTC3130E-1 is guaranteed to meet \nspecifications from 0°C to 85°C junction temperature. Specifications over \nthe –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by design, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls. The LTC3130I/LTC3130I-1 is guaranteed over the –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. The \njunction temperature (T J) is \ncalculated from the ambient temperature (T A) and power dissipation (P D) \naccording to the formula: \n TJ = TA + (P D • θJA°C/W), \nwhere θ JA is the package thermal impedance. Note that the maximum \nambient temperature consistent with these specifications is determined by specific operating conditions in conjunction with board layout, the rated thermal package thermal resistance and other environmental factors.Note 3: Specification is guaranteed by design and not 100% tested in production.\nNote 4: Current measurements are made when the output is\n not switching.\nNote 5: This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended \nto protect the device during momentary overload conditions. Junction temperature will exceed 165°C when overtemperature protection is active. Continuous operation above the specified maximum operating junction temperature may result in device degradation or failure.\nNote 6: Failure to solder the exposed backside of the package to the PC \nboard ground plane will result in a much\n higher thermal resistance.\nNote 7: Switching time measurements are made in an open- loop test \nconfiguration. Timing in the application may vary somewhat from these values due \nto differences in the switch pin voltage during non-overlap durations when switch  \npin voltage is influenced by the magnitude and duration of the inductor current.\nNote 8: Voltage transients on the switch pin(s) beyond the DC limits specified in\n the Absolute Maximum Ratings are non-disruptive to normal \noperation when using good layout practices as described elsewhere in the data sheet and application notes and as seen on the product demo board.\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-15\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L

Supply for \nHigh Side NMOS Gate Drive. Connect to SW1 through a \n22nF capacitor, as close to the part as possible.\nPVIN (Pin 2/Pin 4): Power Input for the Buck-Boost \nConverter. A 4.7μF or larger bypass capacitor should be \nconnected between this pin and the ground plane. The \ncapacitor should be located as close to the IC as possible. \nWhen powered through long leads or from a high ESR \nsource, a larger bulk input capacitor (typically 47μF or \nlarger) may be required.V\nIN (Pin 3/Pin 5): Input Voltage for the VCC Regulator. \nConnect a minimum of 1µF ceramic decoupling capacitor \nfrom this pin to the ground plane. RUN (Pin 4/Pin 6): Input to the Run Comparator. Rais-\ning this pin above 1.05V enables the \nconverter. Pull this \npin above 0.6V (typical) to put the converter in “standby \nmode”, where the internal reference will be enabled, but \nthe part will not be switching. Connecting this pin to a \nresistor divider from VIN to ground allows programming \nan accurate VIN start threshold. To enable the converter \nall the time, tie RUN to VIN. See the Operation section of \nthis data sheet  for more guidance.\nVCC (Pin 5/Pin 7): Output Voltage of the Internal 4V \nVoltage Regulator. This is the supply pin for the internal \ncircuitry. Bypass this output with a minimum of 4.7µF \nceramic capacitor. This internal regulator is powered by \nVIN or EXTV CC. Note that V CC should not be back-driven.\nVCC can be used to power external circuitry as long as \nthe peak load current doesn’t exceed 2mA. Note that this \nadded load will increase the minimum required operating \nVIN voltage by up to 60mV.\nNC (Pin 17, QFN Only): Unused. This pin should be \ngrounded.MPPC (Pin 6/Pin 8): Maximum Power Point Control \nProgramming Input. Connect this pin to a resistor divider \nfrom V\nIN to ground to enable MPPC functionality. If the PIN FUNCTIONS\ndivider voltage drops below 1.0V ( typical), the inductor \ncurrent will be reduced to servo VIN to the programmed \nminimum voltage, as set by the divider. Note that this pin \nis very noise sensitive, therefore minimize trace length and \nstray capacitance. Refer to the Applications Information \nsection of this data sheet for more detail on programming \nthe MPPC. If this function is not needed, tie the pin to VCC.\nGND (Pins 7-8, Exposed Pad Pin 21/Pin 1, Exposed Pad \nPin 17): Ground. Provide a short direct PCB path between \nGND and the ground  plane that the exposed pad is soldered \nto. The exposed pad must be soldered to the PCB ground \nplane. It serves as a power ground connection, and as a \nmeans of conducting heat away from the die.FB (Pin 9/Pin 9 (LTC3130)): Feedback input to the error \namplifier .

There is an internal \n3MΩ pull-down resistor connected to MODE once switch-\ning is enabled, to prevent it from floating.\nEXTV CC (Pin 12/Pin 12): Second Input to the Internal \nVCC Regulator. This pin can be tied to VOUT or another \nvoltage between 3V and 25V. If this input is used, it will \npower the IC, reducing the quiescent current draw on \nVIN in buck applications and allowing the converter to \noperate from a VIN voltage down to 1V or less. A 4.7µF \ndecoupling capacitor is recommended on this pin unless \nit is tied directly to the VOUT decoupling capacitor. If not \nused, this pin should be grounded.PGOOD (Pin 13/Pin 13): Open-drain output that pulls to \nground when FB (LTC3130) or VOUT (LTC3130-1) drops \ntoo far below its regulated voltage. Connect a pull-up \nresistor from this pin to a positive supply. Note that if a \nsupply voltage is present on VIN or EXTV CC, this pin will \nbe forced low in shutdown or UVLO.V\nOUT (Pin 14/Pin 14): Output Voltage of the Converter. \nConnect a minimum value of 4.7µF ceramic capacitor \nfrom this pin to the ground plane.

The LTC3130 has a FB pin for programming VOUT \nanywhere from 1V to 25V, while the LTC3130-1 features \nfour fixed, user-selectable output voltages which can be \nselected using the two digital programming pins. Internal, \nlow RDS(ON)  N-channel power switches reduce solution \ncomplexity and maximize efficiency. A proprietary switch \ncontrol algorithm allows the buck-boost converter to \nmaintain output voltage regulation with input voltages that \nare above, below or equal to the output voltage. T ransi-\ntions between the step-up or step-down operating modes \nare seamless and free of transients and sub-harmonic \nswitching, making this product ideal for noise sensitive \napplications. The LTC3130/LTC3130-1 operate at a fixed \nnominal switching frequency of 1.2MHz, which provides \nan ideal trade-off between small solution size and high \nefficiency. Current mode control provides inherent input \nline voltage rejection, simplified compensation and rapid \nresponse to load transients.\nBurst  Mode  capability  is included  in the LTC3130 /\nLTC3130 -1 and is user-selected via the MODE pin. In \nBurst Mode operation, exceptional light-load efficiency is \nachieved by operating the converter only when necessary \nto maintain voltage regulation. The Burst Mode quiescent \ncurrent is a miserly 1.6µA. When Burst Mode operation \nis selected, the converter automatically switches to fixed \nfrequency PWM  mode at higher loads. (Please refer to the \nTypical Performance Characteristic curves for the mode \ntransition point at different input and output voltages.)\nIf the application requires extremely low noise under all \nload conditions, continuous PWM  operation can also be \nselected via the MODE pin by pulling it high.A MPPC (maximum power point control) function is also \nprovided that prevents the converter from pulling enough \ncurrent to drop V\nIN below a user-programmed threshold \nunder load. This servos the input voltage  of the converter \nto a programmable point for maximum power extraction \nwhen operating from various non-ideal power sources \nsuch as photovoltaic cells.AVCCBST1CBST1 CBST2L\nBST2 PVIN VOUT SW1 SW2\nVCC\nVCC VCC\nL TC3130 PGND PGND\n3130 F01BD\nC\nFigure  1. Power Stage SchematicThe LTC3130/LTC3130-1 also feature an accurate RUN \ncomparator  threshold  with hysteresis , allowing  the \nbuck/boost DC/DC converter to turn on and off at user-\nprogrammed VIN voltage thresholds. With a wide voltage \nrange, 1.6µA Burst Mode current and programmable \nRUN and MPPC pins, these highly integrated monolithic \nconverters are well suited for many diverse applications.\nPWM  MODE OPERATION\nIf the MODE pin is high (or if the load current on the con-\nverter is high enough to command PWM  mode operation \nwith MODE low), the LTC3130/LTC3130-1 operate in a \nfixed 1.2MHz PWM  mode  using  an internally  compensated  \naverage current mode control loop. PWM  mode minimizes \noutput voltage ripple and yields a low noise switching \nfrequency spectrum. A proprietary switching algorithm \nprovides seamless transitions between operating modes \nand eliminates discontinuities in the average inductor \ncurrent, inductor ripple current and loop transfer function \nthroughout all modes of operation. These advantages \nresult in increased efficiency, improved loop stability and \nlower output voltage ripple in comparison to the traditional \nbuck-boost converter.Figure 1 shows the topology of the power stage which is \ncomprised of four N-channel DMOS switches and their \nassociated gate drivers. In PWM  mode \noperation both \nswitch pins transition on every cycle independent of the \ninput and output voltages. In response to the internal \ncontrol loop command, an internal pulse width modulator \ngenerates the appropriate switch duty cycle to maintain \nregulation of the output voltage.\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-116\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130OPERATION\nWhen stepping down from a high input voltage to a lower \noutput voltage, the converter operates in buck mode and \nswitch D remains on for the entire switching cycle except \nfor the minimum  switch  low duration  (typically  70ns). Dur-\ning the switch low duration, switch C is turned on which \nforces SW2 low and charges the flying capacitor, CBST2. \nThis ensures that the switch D gate driver power supply \nrail on BST2 is maintained. The duty cycle of switches A \nand B are adjusted to maintain output voltage regulation \nin buck mode.\nIf the input voltage is lower than the output voltage, the \nconverter operates in boost mode. Switch A remains on \nfor the entire switching cycle except for the minimum \nswitch low duration (typically 70ns). During the switch \nlow duration, switch  B is turned on which forces SW1 \nlow and charges the flying capacitor, CBST1. This ensures \nthat the switch A gate driver power supply rail on BST1 is \nmaintained . The duty cycle  of switches  C and D are adjusted  \nto maintain output voltage regulation in boost mode.\nOscillator\nThe LTC3130/LTC3130-1 operate from an internal oscilla-\ntor with a nominal fixed frequency of 1.2MHz. This allows \nthe DC/DC converter efficiency to be maximized while still \nusing small external components.\nCurrent Mode Control\nThe LTC3130/LTC3130-1 utilizes average current mode \ncontrol for the pulse width modulator. Current mode \ncontrol, both average and the better known peak method, \nenjoy some benefits compared to other control methods \nincluding: simplified loop compensation, rapid response \nto load transients and inherent line voltage rejection.Referring to the\n Block Diagrams, a high gain, internally \ncompensated transconductance voltage error amplifier \nmonitors VOUT through a voltage divider connected to the \nFB pin (LTC3130) or via the internal VOUT voltage divider \n(LTC3130-1). The error amplifier output is used by the \ncurrent mode control loop to command the appropriate \ninductor current level. The inverting input of the internally \ncompensated average current amplifier is connected to \nthe inductor current sense circuit. The average current \namplifier’s output is compared to the oscillator ramps, and the comparator outputs are used to control the duty \ncycle of the switch pins on a cycle-by-cycle basis.The voltage error amplifier makes adjustments to the cur-\nrent command  as necessary  to maintain  V\nOUT in regulation . \nThe voltage error amplifier therefore controls the outer \nvoltage regulation loop. The average current amplifier \nmakes adjustments to the inductor current as directed \nby the voltage error amplifier, and is commonly referred \nto as the inner current loop amplifier.The average current mode control technique is similar to \npeak current mode control except that the average current \namplifier, by virtue of its configuration as an integrator, \ncontrols average current instead of the peak current. This \ndifference eliminates the peak\n to average current error \ninherent to peak current mode control, while maintaining \nmost of the advantages inherent to peak current mode \ncontrol.The compensation components required to ensure proper \noperation have been carefully selected and are integrated \nwithin the LTC3130/LTC3130-1.\nInductor Current Sense and Maximum Average \nOutput\xa0Current\nAs part of the current control loop required for current \nmode control, the LTC3130/LTC3130-1 include \na pair \nof current sensing circuits that measure the buck-boost \nconverter inductor current.The voltage  error amplifier  output ( V\nC) is internally  clamped  \nto an accurate threshold. Since the average inductor current  \nis proportional to VC, the clamp level sets the maximum \naverage inductor current that can be programmed by the \ninner current loop. Taking into account the current sense \namplifier’ s gain, the maximum average inductor cur-\nrent is approximately 850mA typical (660mA minimum,  \nassuming the ILIM pin is pulled high for the LTC3130). \nIn buck mode, the output current is approximately equal \nto 90% of the inductor current IL (due to the forced low \ntime of the B and C switches, where no current is delivered \nto the output):\n IOUT(BUCK)  ≈ 0.9 • I L\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-117\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130OPERATION\nFigure 2. V OUT Feedback Divider (Showing Optional \nFeed-Forward Capacitor)In boost mode, the output current is related to average \ninductor current and duty cycle by:\n  IOUT(BOOST) ≈ IL •  VIN\nVOUT\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 •  η\nSince the output current in boost mode is reduced by the \nstep-up ratio of VIN/VOUT, the output current rating in buck \nmode is always greater than in boost mode. Also, because \nboost mode operation requires a higher inductor current \nfor a given output current compared to buck mode, the \nefficiency (η) in boost mode will generally be lower due \nto higher IL2 • RDS(ON) losses in the power switches. This \nwill further reduce the output current capability in boost \nmode. In either operating mode, however, the inductor \npeak-to-peak ripple current does not play a major role \nin determining the output current capability, unlike peak \ncurrent mode control.\nThe LTC3130/LTC3130-1 measure and control average \ninductor current, and therefore, the inductor ripple cur-\nrent magnitude has little effect on the maximum current \ncapability (in contrast to an equivalent peak current mode \nconverter). Under most conditions in buck mode, the \nLTC3130/LTC3130-1 are capable of providing a minimum \nof 600mA to the load. Refer to the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section for more details. In boost mode, \nas described previously, the output current capability is \nrelated to the boost ratio. For example, for a 5V VIN to 15V \noutput application, the LTC3130/LTC3130-1 can provide \nup to 150mA typical to the load. Refer to the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics section for more detail on \noutput current capability.\nProgramming V OUT (LTC3130)\nThe output voltage of the LTC3130 is programmed using \nan external resistor divider from VOUT to ground with the \ndivider tap connected to the FB pin, as shown in Figure \xa02, \naccording to the equation:\n  VOUT=1.00V • 1 +R1\nR2\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f7    (Refer to Figure 2)The output voltage can be set anywhere from 1.0V to 25V.\nAn optional  feed-forward  capacitor  can be added  in parallel  \nwith R1 (as shown in Figure 2) to reduce Burst Mode ripple \nand improve transient response of the voltage loop. The \ntypical feed-forward capacitor value can be calculated by:\n  CFFpF( )=40\nR1 (Meg)\nIn some applications, where the voltage-loop bandwidth \nis high, it may prove beneficial to add a resistor in series \nwith the feed-forward capacitor to limit the high fre-\nquency gain. The value isn’t critical, and resistor values of  \napproximately R1/20 are generally recommended.\nVOUT Programming Pins (LTC3130-1)\nThe LTC3130-1 has a precision internal voltage divider \non VOUT, eliminating the need for high value external \nfeedback resistors. This not only eliminates two external \ncomponents , it minimizes  no-load quiescent  current  \nby using very high resistance values that would not be  \npractical when used externally due to the effects of noise \nand board leakages that would cause VOUT regulation er-\nrors. The tap point on this divider is digitally selected by \nusing the VS1 and VS2 pins to program one of four fixed \noutput voltages.\nThe VS1 and VS2 pins can be grounded or connected \nto VCC to select the desired output voltage, according to \nTable 1. They can also be driven dynamically from external \nlogic signals, as long as the pin’s specified logic levels are \nsatisfied and the absolute maximum ratings for the pins \nare not exceeded.3130 F02L TC3130VOUT\nR1COUT\nFB\nGNDCFF\nR2RFFOPTIONAL\nFEED-FORWARD\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-118\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130OPERATION\nNote that driving VS1 or VS2 to a logic high that is below \nthe VCC voltage can result in an increase of up to 1µA of \ncurrent draw from VCC per VS pin. This does not occur in \nshutdown or if VCC is below its UVLO threshold, in which \ncase these inputs are disabled and will not cause any extra \ncurrent draw.\nTable 1. V OUT Program Settings for the LTC3130-1\nVS2 VS1 VOUT\n0 0 1.8V\n0 VCC 3.3V\nVCC 0 5.0V\nVCC VCC 12V\nProgramming the ILIM Threshold (LTC3130 only)\nThe LTC3130 has two average current limit settings, \nwhich are set by the ILIM pin. If ILIM is pulled high (tied \nto VCC), the average inductor current limit will be set to \n660mA (minimum). If the ILIM pin is pulled low (tied to \nground), the average inductor current limit will be reduced \nto 250mA (minimum). This setting can be used in low \npower applications to reduce the maximum current draw \nfrom sources that may suffer excessive voltage drop at \nthe full 600mA current limit setting, or to simply reduce \nthe maximum output current.\nVOUT Undervoltage and Foldback Current Limit\nThe LTC3130/LTC3130-1 include a foldback current limit \nfeature to reduce power dissipation into a shorted output. \nWhen VOUT is less than 0.7V (typical), the average current \nlimit is reduced to about half of its normal value. In the \ncase of the LTC3130 with the ILIM pin set low, the average \ninductor current limit has already been cut in half and will \nnot be further reduced during undervoltage.Overload Peak Current \nLimit\nThe LTC3130/LTC3130-1 also have peak overload current \n(IPEAK) and zero current (I ZERO) comparators. The IPEAK \ncurrent comparator turns off switch A for the remainder \nof the switching cycle if the inductor current exceeds the \nmaximum threshold of 1.3A (typical). An inductor current level of this magnitude may occur during a fault, such as \nan output short circuit, or possibly for a few cycles  dur-\ning large load or input voltage transients. Note that it may \nalso occur if there is excessive inductor ripple current (or \ninductor saturation) due to an improperly sized inductor.\nNote that if a peak current limit is reached while VOUT is \nalso less than 0.7V typical (which would be indicative of \na shorted output), a soft-start cycle will be triggered.I\nZERO Comparator\nThe LTC3130 /LTC3130 -1 feature  near discontinuous  \ninductor current operation at light output loads by virtue \nof the IZERO comparator circuit. By limiting the reverse \ncurrent magnitude in PWM  mode, a balance between low \nnoise operation and improved efficiency at light loads is \nachieved. The IZERO threshold is set near the zero current \nlevel in PWM  mode, and as a result the reverse current \nmagnitude will be a function of inductance value and out-\nput voltage due to the comparator’s propagation delay. In \ngeneral, higher output voltages and lower inductor values \nwill result in increased peak reverse current.\nIn automatic Burst Mode operation (MODE pin low), the \nIZERO threshold is increased so that reverse inductor cur-\nrent does not normally occur. This maximizes efficiency \nat light loads.Note that reverse current is also inhibited\n during soft-\nstart\xa0( regardless of the MODE pin setting) to prevent VOUT \ndischarge when starting up into pre-biased outputs.\nBurst Mode OPERATION\nWhen the MODE pin is held low, the LTC3130/LTC3130-1 \nare configured for automatic Burst Mode operation. As a \nresult, the buck-boost DC/DC converter will operate with \nnormal  continuous  PWM  switching  above a predetermined  \nminimum output load and will automatically transition  to \npower saving Burst Mode operation below this output \nload level. Refer to the Typical Performance Character -\nistics section of this data sheet to determine the Burst \nMode transition threshold for various combinations of \nVIN and\xa0V OUT.\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-119\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130OPERATION\nIf MODE is low, at light output loads, the LTC3130/\nLTC3130 -1 go into a standby or sleep state when the \noutput voltage achieves its nominal regulation level. The \nsleep state halts PWM  switching and powers down all \nnon-essential functions of the IC, significantly reducing \nthe quiescent current of the converter to just 1.6µA typical. \nThis greatly improves overall power conversion efficiency \nwhen the output load is light. Since the converter is not \noperating in sleep, the output voltage will slowly decay at a \nrate determined by the output load current and the output \ncapacitor value. When the output voltage has decayed by a \nsmall amount, the LTC3130/LTC3130-1 wake and resume \nnormal  PWM  switching  operation  until the voltage  on VOUT \nis restored to the previous level. If the load is very light, \nthe converter may only need to switch for a few cycles  to \nrestore VOUT and may sleep for extended periods of time, \nsignificantly improving efficiency. If the load is suddenly \nincreased above the burst transition threshold, the part \nwill automatically  resume  continuous  PWM  operation  until \nthe load is once again reduced.\nNote that Burst Mode operation is inhibited until soft-start \nis done, the MPPC pin is greater than 1.05V and VOUT has \nreached 95% of regulation.\nSoft-Start\nThe LTC3130/ LTC3130-1 soft-start circuit minimizes input  \ncurrent transients and output voltage overshoot on initial \npower up. The required timing components for soft-start \nare internal to the IC and produce a nominal average cur-\nrent limit soft-start duration of approximately 12ms. The \ninternal soft-start circuit slowly ramps the error amplifier \noutput. In doing so, the maximum average inductor current   \nis also slowly increased, starting from zero. Soft-start is \nreset if the RUN pin drops  below  the accurate  run threshold , \nVCC drops below its UVLO threshold, a thermal shutdown \noccurs, or a peak current limit occurs while VOUT is less \nthan 0.7V typical.\nNote that because the average current limit is being soft-\nstarted, the VOUT rise time will be load dependent, and is \ntypically less that  12ms.VCC Regulator and EXTV CC Input\nAn internal low dropout regulator (LDO) generates a nomi-\nnal 4V VCC rail from VIN, or from EXTV CC if a valid EXTV CC \nvoltage is present. The VCC rail powers the internal control \ncircuitry and the gate drivers of the LTC3130/LTC3130-1. \nThe VCC regulator is enabled even in shutdown, but will \nregulate to a lower voltage. The VCC regulator includes \ncurrent-limit protection to safeguard against accidental \nshort-circuiting of the VCC rail. VCC should be decoupled \nwith a 4.7µF ceramic capacitor located close to the IC.During start-up, the IC will choose the higher of V\nIN or \nEXTV CC to generate VCC. Once VCC is above its rising UVLO \nthreshold, EXTV CC will continue to be used if it is above \n3.0V typical, otherwise VIN will be used. This allows start-\nup from low VIN sources (in applications where a valid \nEXTV CC voltage is present), while minimizing LDO power \ndissipation after start-up in applications where VIN may \nbe much higher than V CC.\nUse of the EXTV CC input allows the converter to operate \nfrom VIN voltages less than 1V, as long as EXTV CC is held \nin its operating  range  of 3.0V minimum  and 25V maximum . \nIf EXTV CC is tied to VOUT in buck applications, it will also \nreduce the input current drawn from VIN, thereby increasing  \nconverter efficiency, especially at light loads.If an independent source, such as a battery or another \nsupply rail, is used to power EXTV\nCC, then the IC can start \nup and operate  at any input voltage, from 25V down to  \n(theoretically) 0V (assuming the RUN pin is held above \n1.05V). In practice, the minimum VIN voltage capability \nwill be application specific, determined by the required \noutput voltage and output current of the converter. Due \nto the rapid drop in efficiency at very low input voltages, \nthe practical VIN limit is usually around 0.6V, assuming a \nlow resistance  source, and that the step-up ratio to VOUT \ndoesn’t become duty cycle limited. Refer to the Typical \nPerformance Characteristic curves for the output voltage \nand current capability versus V IN.\nIf not used, EXTV CC should be grounded. \nLTC3130/LTC 3130-120\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130OPERATION\nL TC3130\nENABLE SWITCHING\nENABLE V REF \nAND PGOOD\nLOGIC THRESHOLDACCURATE THRESHOLD\n3130 F03+\n––+\n0.6VRUN1.05VVIN\nR3\nR4\nFigure  3. Accurate RUN Pin ComparatorUndervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nThe VCC UVLO has a falling voltage threshold of 2.175V \n(typical). If the VCC voltage falls below this threshold, IC \noperation is disabled until VCC rises above 2.30V (typical).\nTherefore, if a valid voltage source is not present on  \nEXTV CC, the minimum VIN for the part to start up is 2.30V \n(typical).Note that until V\nCC is above the UVLO threshold, the part \nwill remain in a low quiescent current state (1.4µA typical). \nThis facilitates start-up from very weak sources.\nRUN Pin Comparator\nWhen RUN is driven above its logic threshold (0.6V typi-\ncal), the internal voltage reference and the PGOOD circuit \nare enabled (assuming VCC is above 2.30V typical). If the \nvoltage on RUN is increased further so that it exceeds \nthe RUN comparator’s accurate rising threshold (1.05V \ntypical), all functions of the buck-boost converter will be \nenabled and a start-up sequence will ensue. The RUN pin \ncomparator has 100mV of hysteresis, so operation will \nbe inhibited if the pin drops below 0.95V.Therefore, with the addition of an optional resistor divider \nas shown in Figure 3, the RUN pin can be used to estab-\nlish user- programmable  turn- on and turn- off (UVLO) \nthresholds. This feature can be utilized to minimize battery \ndrain below a programmed input voltage, or to operate the \nconverter in a hiccup mode from very low current sources.If RUN is brought below the accurate comparator falling \nthreshold, the buck-boost converter will inhibit switching, \nbut the VCC regulator and control circuitry will remain \npowered. In this state, the typical VIN quiescent current is \nonly 1.4µA, in order to completely shut down the IC and \nreduce the VIN current to 500nA (typical), it is necessary \nto ensure that RUN is brought below its minimum low \nlogic threshold of 0.2V.RUN can be tied directly to V\nIN to continuously enable the \nIC when the input supply is present. Also note that RUN \ncan be driven above VIN or VOUT as long as it stays within \nthe absolute maximum rating of 25V.The converter  is enabled  when  the voltage  on RUN exceeds \n1.05V (nominal).

In these cases, a small filter capacitor can \nbe added across R4.\nPGOOD Comparator\nThe LTC3130/LTC3130-1 provide an open-drain PGOOD \noutput that pulls low if FB (LTC3130) or VOUT (LTC3130 -1) \nfalls more than 7.5% ( typical) below its programmed \nvalue.

PGOOD is not affected by the accurate RUN \nthreshold. Therefore, if PGOOD is pulled up to VIN or VCC, \nthis will add to the VIN quiescent current in shutdown and \nUVLO, when PGOOD is low. For the lowest possible VIN \ncurrent in shutdown or UVLO, PGOOD should be pulled \nup to V OUT or some other source.\nMaximum Power Point Control (MPPC)The MPPC input of the LTC3130/LTC3130-1 can be used \nwith an optional external voltage divider to dynamically \nadjust the commanded inductor current in order to main-\ntain a minimum input voltage when using high resistance \nsources, such as photovoltaic panels, so as to maximize \ninput power transfer and prevent V\nIN from dropping too \nlow under load.Referring to Figure\n 4, the MPPC pin is internally connected \nto the noninverting input of a gm amplifier, whose invert-\ning input is connected to the 1.0V reference. If the voltage \nat MPPC, using the external voltage divider, falls below \nthe reference voltage, the output of the amplifier pulls \nthe internal VC node low. This reduces the commanded \naverage inductor current so as to reduce the input current \nand regulate VIN to the programmed minimum voltage, \nas given by:\n  VIN(MPPC) =1.00V • 1 +R5\nR6\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nNote that external compensation should not be required \nfor MPPC loop stability if the input filter capacitor, CIN, \nis at least 22µF.The MPPC divider resistor values can be in the MΩ range \nso as to minimize the input current in very low power ap-\nplications. However, stray capacitance and noise pickup \non the MPPC pin must also be minimized. If the MPPC \nfunction  is not required , the MPPC  pin should  be tied to VCC.\nBeware of adding a noise filter capacitor to the MPPC pin, \nas the added filter pole may cause the MPPC control loop \nto be unstable.\nNote that because Burst Mode operation will be inhibited \nif the MPPC loop takes control, the converter will be op-\nerating in fixed frequency mode, and will therefore require \na minimum of about 6 mA of continuous input current to \noperate. For operation from weaker sources, such as small \nindoor solar panels, refer to the Applications Information \nsection to see how the RUN pin may be programmed to \ncontrol the converter in a hysteretic manner while provid-\ning an effective MPPC function by maintaining VIN at the \ndesired voltage. This technique can be used with sources \nas weak as 3µA (enough  to power the IC in UVLO and the \nexternal RUN divider).\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-122\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nA standard application circuit for the LTC3130-1 is shown \non the front page of this data sheet. There are numerous \nother application examples for both the LTC3130-1 and \nLTC3130 shown in the Typical Applications section of \nthis data sheet.\nThe appropriate selection of external components is de-\npendent upon the required performance of the IC in each \nparticular application given considerations and trade- offs \nsuch as PCB area, input and output voltage range, output \nvoltage ripple, transient response, required efficiency, \nthermal considerations and cost. This section of the data \nsheet provides some basic guidelines and considerations \nto aid in the selection of external components and the de-\nsign of the applications circuit, as well as more application \ncircuit examples.\nVCC Capacitor Selection\nThe VCC output of the LTC3130/LTC3130 -1 is generated \nfrom VIN or EXTV CC by a low dropout linear regulator. The \nVCC regulator has been designed for stable operation with \na wide range of output capacitors. For most applications, \na low ESR capacitor of at least 4.7µF should be used. The \ncapacitor should be located as close to the VCC pin as pos-\nsible and connected to the VCC pin and ground through the \nshortest traces possible. VCC is the regulator output and \nis also the internal supply pin for the IC control circuitry \nas well as the gate drivers and boost rail charging diodes.\nInductor Selection\nThe choice  of inductor  used in LTC3130 /LTC3130 -1 \napplication circuits influences the maximum deliverable \noutput current, the converter bandwidth, the magnitude \nof the inductor current ripple and the overall converter \nefficiency. The inductor must have a low DC series resis-\ntance or output current capability and efficiency will be \ncompromised. Larger inductor values reduce inductor \ncurrent ripple but do not increase output current capability \nas is the case with peak current mode control. Larger value \ninductors also tend to have a higher DC series resistance for a given case size, which will have a negative impact on \nefficiency. Larger values of inductance will also lower the \nright half plane (RHP) zero frequency when operating in \nboost mode, which can compromise loop stability. Nearly \nall LTC3130/LTC3130-1 application circuits deliver the \nbest performance with an inductor value between 3.3µH \nand 15µH, depending on VIN and VOUT. Buck mode only \napplications can use the larger inductor values as they \nare unaffected by the RHP zero, while mostly boost ap-\nplications generally require inductance on the low end of \nthis range depending on how large the step-up ratio is.Regardless of inductor value, the saturation current rating \nshould  be selected  such that it is greater  than the worst -case \naverage  inductor  current  plus half of the ripple  current . The \npeak-to-peak inductor current ripple for each operational \nmode can be calculated \nfrom the following formula, where \nf is the switching frequency (1.2MHz), L is the inductance \nin µH and tLOW is the switch pin minimum low time in \nµs. The switch pin minimum low time is typically 0.07µs.\n ∆IL(P-P)(BUCK) =VOUT\nLVIN– VOUT\nVIN\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f71\nf– tLOW\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7Amps\n∆IL(P-P)(BOOST) =VIN\nLVOUT– VIN\nVOUT\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f71\nf– tLOW\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7Amps\nIt should be noted that the worst-case peak-to-peak in-\nductor ripple current occurs when the duty cycle in buck \nmode is minimum (highest VIN) and in boost mode when \nthe duty cycle is 50% ( VOUT = 2 • VIN). As an example, if \nVIN (minimum) = 2.5V and VIN (maximum) = 15V, VOUT \n= 5V and L = 10µH, the peak-to-peak inductor ripples at \nthe voltage extremes  (15V VIN for buck and 2.5V VIN for \nboost) are:\n Buck = 251mA peak-to-peak\n Boost = 94mA peak-to-peak\nOne-half of this inductor ripple current must be added to \nthe highest expected average inductor current in order to \nselect the proper saturation current rating for the inductor.\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-123\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nTo minimize core losses and to prevent high inductor cur-\nrent ripple from tripping the peak current limit before the \naverage current limit is reached, an inductor value with a \n�IL of less than 500mA  P-P should be chosen. For loads \nthat operate well below current limit, higher  inductor  ripple \ncan be tolerated to allow the use of a lower value inductor.\nTo avoid the possibility of inductor saturation during load \ntransients, an inductor with a saturation current rating \nof at least 1200mA is recommended for all applications \n(unless the ILIM pin of the LTC3130 is set low, in which \ncase a 650mA rated inductor may be used).\nNote that in boost mode, especially at large step-up ra-\ntios, the output current capability is often limited by the \ntotal\xa0 resistive losses in the power stage. These losses \ninclude switch resistances, inductor DC resistance and \nPCB trace resistance. Avoid inductors with a high DC \nresistance ( DCR) as they can degrade the maximum out-\nput current capability from what is shown in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics section and from the Typical \nApplication circuits.As a guideline, the inductor DCR should be significantly \nless than the typical power\n switch resistance of 350mΩ. \nThe only exceptions are applications that have a maxi-\nmum output current much less than what the LTC3130/\nLTC3130-1 are capable of delivering. Generally speaking, \ninductors with a DCR in the range of 0.05Ω to 0.15Ω are \nrecommended. Lower values of DCR will improve the ef-\nficiency at the expense of size, while higher DCR values \nwill reduce efficiency (typically by a few percent ) while \nallowing the use of a physically smaller inductor.Different  inductor  core materials  and styles  have an impact  \non the size and price of an inductor at any given current \nrating. Shielded construction is generally preferred as it \nminimizes the chances of interference with other circuitry. \nThe choice of inductor style depends upon the price, sizing, \nand EMI requirements of a particular application.Table 2 provides a wide\n sampling of inductor families from \ndifferent manufacturers that are well suited to LTC3130/\nLTC3130-1 applications. However, be sure to check the current rating and DC resistance for the particular value \nyou need, as not all of the inductor values in a given family \nwill be suitable.\nTable 2.

Multilayer ceramic capacitors are an excellent \noption as they have low ESR and are available in small \nfootprints. The capacitor value should be chosen large \nenough to reduce the output voltage ripple to acceptable \nlevels. Neglecting the capacitor’s ESR and ESL (effect \nseries inductance), the peak-to-peak output voltage ripple \ncan be calculated by the following formula, where f is the \nfrequency in MHz (1.2MHz), COUT is the capacitance in µF, \ntLOW is the switch pin minimum low time in µs (0.07µs) \nand I LOAD is the output current in Amps:\n ∆VP-P(BUCK) =ILOADtLOW\nCOUTVolts\n∆VP-P(BOOST) =ILOAD\nfCOUTVOUT– VIN+tLOWfVIN\nVOUT\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7Volts\nExamining the previous equations reveal that the output \nvoltage ripple increases with load current and is gener -\nally higher in boost mode than in buck mode. Note that \nthese equations only take into account the voltage ripple \nthat occurs from the inductor current to the output being \ndiscontinuous. They provide a good approximation of the \nripple at any significant load current but underestimate the \noutput voltage ripple at very light loads where the output \nvoltage ripple is dominated by the inductor current ripple.\nIn addition to the output voltage ripple generated across \nthe output capacitance, there is also output voltage ripple \nproduced across the internal resistance of the output \ncapacitor. The ESR-generated output voltage ripple is \nproportional  to the series  resistance  of the output  capacitor  \nand is given by the following expressions where RESR is the series resistance of the output capacitor and all other \nterms as previously defined:\n  ∆VP-P(BUCK) =ILOADRESR\n1– tLOWf≅ILOADRESRVolts\n∆VP-P(BOOST) =ILOADRESRVOUT\nVIN1– tLOWf ( )\n≅ILOADRESRVOUT\nVIN\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7Volts\nIn most  LTC3130 /LTC3130 -1 applications , an output  \ncapacitor between 10µF and 47µF will work well. To mini-\nmize output ripple in Burst Mode operation, or transients \nincurred by large step loads, values of 22µF or larger are \nrecommended.\nInput Capacitor Selection\nThe PVIN pin carries the full inductor current, while the VIN \npin provides power to internal control circuits in the IC. To \nminimize input voltage  ripple and ensure proper opera-\ntion of the IC, a low ESR bypass capacitor with a value of \nat least 4.7µF should be located as close to the PVIN pin \nas possible. The VIN pin should be bypassed with a 1μF \nceramic capacitor located close to the pin, and Kelvined \nto “quiet side” of the primary VIN decoupling capacitor. \nDo not tie the V IN pin directly to PV IN pin.\nWhen powered through long leads or from a power source \nwith any significant resistance, an additional, larger value \nbulk input capacitor may be required and is generally \nrecommended. In such applications, a 47µF to 100µF \nlow ESR electrolytic capacitor in parallel with the 4.7µF \nceramic capacitor generally yields a high performance, \nlow cost solution.For applications using the MPPC feature, a \nminimum CIN \ncapacitor value of 22µF is recommended. Larger values \ncan be used without limitation.\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-125\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nRecommended Input and Output Capacitor Types\nThe capacitors used to filter the input and output of the \nLTC3130/LTC3130-1 must have low ESR and must be \nrated to handle the AC currents generated by the switching \nconverter . This is important  to maintain  proper  functioning \nof the IC and to reduce output voltage ripple. There are \nmany capacitor types that are well suited to these appli-\ncations including multilayer ceramic, low ESR tantalum, \nOS-CON and POSCAP technologies. In addition, there \nare certain types of electrolytic capacitors such as solid \naluminum organic polymer capacitors that are designed \nfor low ESR and high AC currents and these are also well \nsuited to some LTC3130/LTC3130-1 applications. The choice of capacitor technology is primarily dictated \nby a trade-off between size, leakage current \nand cost. In \nbackup power applications, the input or output capacitor \nmight be a super or ultra capacitor with a capacitance \nvalue measuring in the Farad range. The selection criteria \nin these applications are generally similar except that volt-\nage ripple is generally not a concern. Some capacitors exhibit a high DC leakage current which \nmay preclude their consideration for applications that \nrequire a very low quiescent \ncurrent in Burst Mode op-\neration. Note that ultra capacitors may have a rather high \nESR, therefore a 4.7µF (minimum) ceramic capacitor is \nrecommended in parallel, close to the IC pins.\nBeware of Capacitor DC Bias Effect\nCeramic capacitors are often utilized in switching con-\nverter applications due to their small size, low ESR and \nlow leakage currents. However, many ceramic capacitors \nintended for power applications experience a significant \nloss in capacitance from their rated value as the DC bias \nvoltage on the capacitor increases. It is not uncommon for \na small surface mount capacitor to lose more than 50% \nof its rated capacitance when operated at even half of its \nmaximum rated voltage. This effect is generally reduced \nas the case size is increased for the same nominal value \ncapacitor. As a result, it is often necessary to use a larger value capacitance or a higher voltage rated capacitor than \nwould  ordinarily  be required  to actually  realize  the intended  \ncapacitance  at the operating  voltage  of the application . X5R \nand X7R dielectric types are recommended as they exhibit \nthe best performance over the wide operating range and \ntemperature of the LTC3130/LTC3130-1. To verify that \nthe intended capacitance is achieved  in the application \ncircuit, be sure to consult the capacitor vendor’s curve \nof capacitance versus DC bias voltage.\nUsing the Programmable RUN Function to Operate \nfrom Extremely Weak Input Sources\nAnother application of the programmable RUN pin is \nthat it can be used to operate the converter in a “hiccup” \nmode from extremely weak sources. This allows operation \nfrom sources that can only generate microamps of output \ncurrent, and would be far too weak to sustain normal \nsteady-state operation, even with the use of the MPPC \npin. Because the LTC3130/LTC3130-1 draw only 1.4µA \ntypical from VIN until they are enabled, the RUN pin can be \nprogrammed to keep the ICs disabled until VIN reaches the \nprogrammed  voltage  level. In this manner , the input  source  \ncan trickle-charge an input storage capacitor, even if it can \nonly supply microamps of current, until VIN reaches the \nturn-on threshold  set by the RUN pin divider . The converter  \nwill then be enabled, using the stored charge in the input \ncapacitor to power the converter and bring up VOUT, until \nVIN drops below the turn-off threshold, at which point the \nconverter will turn off and the process  will repeat.\nThis approach allows the converter to run from weak \nsources as small, thin-film solar cells using indoor light-\ning. Although the converter will be operating in bursts, it \nis enough to charge an output capacitor to power low duty \ncycle loads, such as in wireless sensor applications, or \nto trickle-charge a battery. In addition, note that the input \nvoltage will be cycling (with  10% ripple as set by the UVLO \nhysteresis) about a fixed voltage, as determined by the \ndivider. This allows the high impedance source to oper-\nate about the programmed optimal voltage for maximum \npower transfer.\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-126\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIn these  “trickle -charge ” applications , a larger  input  capaci -\ntor is generally required. If the load on VOUT is extremely \nlight, such that the available steady-state input power can \nsustain VOUT, then the input capacitor simply has to have \nenough charge to bring VOUT into regulation before VIN \ndischarges below the falling UVLO threshold (assuming \nthat the goal is to charge  up VOUT in a single “burst” and \nthen maintain VOUT regulation). In this case, the minimum \nvalue required for C IN can be determined by:\n  CIN(MIN) >COUT• VOUT2\nηVIN2– 0.9 • VIN2( )( ) ( )\nwhere VIN is the programmed rising UVLO threshold and \nη is the average conversion efficiency, given VIN and VOUT. \nIt can be seen that a larger COUT capacitor will require a \nlarger C IN capacitor to charge it.\nThe time required for the CIN capacitor to charge up to the \nVIN rising UVLO threshold (starting from zero volts) is:\n  tCHARGE sec( ) =CINµF( )• VIN(UVLO)\nICHARGE µA( ) –1.4µA –ILEAK µA( ) ( )\nwhere ILEAK is the leakage of the input capacitor in µA at \nthe programmed V IN UVLO voltage.\nFor applications where VOUT must remain in regulation \nduring a pulsed load for a given period of time, the input \ncapacitor  value  required  will be dictated  by the programmed  \nVIN and VOUT, and the duration  and magnitude  of the output  \nload current, as given by:\n  CIN(MIN) >IOUT• VOUT•2• t\nηVIN2– 0.9 • VIN2( )( ) ( )\nwhere CIN is in micro Farads, IOUT is the average load \ncurrent in milliamps for duration t in milliseconds. VIN \nis the programmed rising UVLO threshold and η is the \naverage conversion efficiency, given VIN and VOUT. This \ncalculation assumes that the VOUT capacitor has already \nbeen charged, and that the load on VOUT before and after \nthe load pulse is low enough as to be sustained by the \navailable steady-state input power.For example, if VOUT is 5V, with a pulsed load of 25mA \nfor a duration of 5ms, and VIN has been programmed for \na rising UVLO threshold of 12V, then the minimum CIN \ncapacitor required, assuming a conversion efficiency of \n85%, would be 53.7µF, so a 68µF input capacitor would \nbe recommended.\nWhen using high value  RUN pin divider resistors (in the \nMΩ range) to minimize current draw on VIN, a small noise \nfilter capacitor may be necessary across the lower divider \nresistor to prevent noise from erroneously tripping the \nRUN comparator . The capacitor  value  should  be minimized \n(10pF may do) so as not to introduce a time delay long \nenough for the input voltage to drop significantly below \nthe desired VIN threshold. Note that larger VIN decoupling \ncapacitor  values  will minimize  this effect  by providing  more  \nholdup time on V IN.\nUse of the EXTV CC Input\nAs discussed in the Operation section of this data sheet, \nthe LTC3130/LTC3130-1 include an EXTV CC input that can \nbe used to provide VCC for the IC, allowing start-up and/\nor operation in applications where VIN is below  the VCC \nUVLO threshold, all the way down to less than 1V.Possible sources that could be used to power the EXTV\nCC \ninput would include VOUT (if VOUT is programmed for at \nleast 3.15V and if VIN is at least 2.4V to start), or an inde-\npendent voltage rail that may be available in the system, \nor even a battery.The requirements for the \nEXTV CC voltage are that it is a \nminimum of 3.0V typical, and an absolute maximum of \n25V. It must also be able to supply a minimum of 6mA \nof current. If the source of EXTV CC is not very close to \nthe IC, then a decoupling capacitor of 4.7µF minimum is \nrecommended at the EXTV CC pin.\nIn the case of using a battery to power EXTV CC, the battery \nlife for continuous  steady -state operation  in fixed frequency  \nmode can be estimated by:\n Battery Life (Hours) = Battery Capacity (mA-Hr)/6mA\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-127\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nL TC3130/\nL TC3130-1VOUTVOUT\n4V TO 25VPVIN\nVIN\nRUNVIN\n1V TO 25VCOUTBAT54C\nEXTV CC\n3031 F05EXTV CC\nSGND4.7µF3.6V+V+\n–\nFigure  5.

Using the RUN Pin to Set the Minimum Voltage \nfor EXTV CC to 3.15VFor example, a 3.6V battery with a capacity of 2600mA -Hr \n(2.6A-Hr) could  power  the IC continuously  in fixed  \nfrequency mode for ~433 hours (only about 18 days). \nHowever, if the IC is in Burst Mode operation at light load, \nthe battery life time will be extended, possibly by orders \nof magnitude (depending on the load) since the current \ndemand when the IC is sleeping will be only 1.6µA typical. \nIn shutdown, the current draw will be only 0.5µA typical.\nFor applications  where  VOUT will be greater  than the battery \nvoltage, and at least 3.6V, a battery and a dual Schottky \ndiode can be used to get the part started at low VIN. After \nstart-up, the IC will be powered from VOUT, so there will \nbe no steady-state current draw on the battery. In this \ncase, the battery life may approach its shelf life (even in \ncontinuous  fixed frequency  operation ). In shutdown, there \nwill be about 0.5uA of current draw from the battery. An \nexample of this configuration is shown in Figure 5.periodically trying to start switching, as it goes in and out \nof UVLO. If EXTV CC is held above 3.0V, this will not occur.\nIn applications where the VIN and EXTV CC voltages are \nsuch that this scenario could occur, the RUN pin can be \nused to monitor the EXTV CC input and inhibit operation \nwhenever EXTV CC is below 3.15V. An example of this is \nshown in Figure 6.\nNote that during start-up, when VCC is still in UVLO, the IC \nchooses the higher of VIN or EXTV CC to power VCC (even \nif EXTV CC is below 3.0V). After start-up however, when \nVCC has risen above its rising UVLO threshold, the IC \nwill choose to use the EXTV CC input to power V CC only if \nEXTV CC is above 3.0V, typical. This is done to avoid using \nEXTV CC at a very low voltage when a higher voltage may \nbe available at V IN.\nTherefore, there could be a situation where the IC would \nswitch between using EXTV CC during  start-up, and VIN as \nthe source for VCC after start-up. However, if VIN is below \nthe UVLO threshold, VCC will drop and revert to using \nEXTV CC again. This cycling will only occur if VIN is below \nthe UVLO falling threshold and EXTV CC is greater than the \nUVLO rising threshold of 2.4V, but less than 3.0V (and \nthe part is enabled, with the RUN pin above the accurate \nrising threshold). Note that during this time, the IC will be Programming the MPPC Voltage\nAs discussed in the previous section, the LTC3130/\nLTC3130-1 include an MPPC function to optimize perfor -\nmance  when  operating  from voltage  sources  with relatively \nhigh source resistance. Using an external voltage divider \nfrom VIN, the MPPC function takes control of the average \ninductor current when necessary to maintain a minimum \ninput voltage, as programmed by the user. Referring to \nFigure 3:\n  VIN(MPPC) =1.0V • 1 +R5\nR6\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nThis is useful for such applications as photovoltaic pow-\nered converters, since the maximum power transfer point \noccurs when the photovoltaic panel is operated at about \n75% of its open-circuit voltage. For example, when operat-\ning from a photovoltaic panel with an open-circuit voltage \nof 5V, the maximum power transfer point will be when \nthe panel is loaded such that its output voltage is about \n3.75V. Referring to Figure 4, choosing values of 2MΩ for \nR5 and 732k for R6 will program the MPPC function to \nregulate the maximum input current so as to maintain VIN \nat a minimum of 3.73V (typical). Note that if the panel can \nprovide  more  power  than the application  requires , the input  \nvoltage will rise above the programmed MPPC point. This \nis fine as long as the input  voltage doesn’t exceed 25V.\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-128\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFor weak  input  sources  with very high resistance  (hundreds  \nof Ohms or more), the LTC3130/LTC3130-1 may still draw \nmore current than the source can provide, causing VIN to \ndrop below the UVLO threshold. For these applications, \nit is recommended that the programmable RUN feature \nbe used, as described in a previous section.\nMPPC Compensation and Gain\nWhen using MPPC, there are a number  of variables that \naffect the gain and phase of the input voltage control loop. \nPrimarily  these are the input capacitance , the MPPC resistor  \ndivider ratio and the VIN source resistance. To simplify the \ndesign of the application circuit, the MPPC control loop \nin the LTC3130/LTC3130-1 is designed with a relatively \nlow gain, such that external MPPC loop compensation is \ngenerally not required when using a VIN capacitor of at \nleast 22µF.The gain from the MPPC pin to the internal control voltage \nis about ten, and the gain of the internal control voltage \nto average inductor current is about one. Therefore, a \nchange of 60mV a the MPPC pin will result in a change of \naverage inductor current of about 600mA, which is close \nto the full current capability of the\n IC. So the programmed \ninput voltage will be maintained within about 6% over the \nfull current range of the IC (which may be more than that \nrequired by the load).\nSources of Small Photovoltaic Panels\nA list of companies that manufacture small solar panels \n(sometimes referred to as modules or solar cell arrays), \nsuitable for use with the LTC3130/LTC3130-1 is provided \nin Table 4.\nTable 4.

However , when  operating \nat high current levels, there may be significant heat gener -\nated within the IC. As a result, careful consideration must \nbe given to the thermal environment of the IC in order to \nprovide a means to remove heat from the IC and ensure \nthat the LTC3130 /LTC3130 -1 is able to provide  its full-rated  \noutput current. Specifically, the exposed die attach pad \nof both the QFN and MSE packages must be soldered to \na copper layer on the PCB to maximize the conduction of \nheat out of the IC package. This can be accomplished by \nutilizing multiple vias from the die attach pad connection \nunderneath  the IC package  to other PCB layer( s) containing  \na large copper plane. A typical board layout incorporating \nthese concepts in show in Figure 7.As described elsewhere in this data sheet, the EXTV\nCC \npin may be used to reduce the VCC power dissipation \nterm significantly in high VIN applications, lowering die \ntemperature  and improving efficiency.\nIf the IC die temperature exceeds approximately 165°C, \novertemperature  shutdown will be invoked  and all switching  \nwill be inhibited. The part will remain disabled until the die \ntemperature cools by approximately 10°C. The soft-start \ncircuit is re-initialized in overtemperature shutdown to \nprovide a smooth recovery when the IC die temperature \ncools enough to resume operation.\nApplications with Low V IN and V OUT\nApplications which must operate from input voltages of \nless that 3V and have an output voltage of 1.8V or less, \nwhile operating at heavy loads, will benefit significantly \nfrom the addition of Schottky diode from SW2 to VOUT. \nDiodes such as an MBR0530 or equivalent are recom-\nmended for these applications.\nLTC3130/LTC 3130-129\n3130f For more information www.linear .com/L TC3130Figure 7.
