The IC integrates a COT (Constant-On-Time)PWM controller with two MOSFET drivers, as well asoutput current monitoring and protection functions.Referring to the function block diagram of TON Genx, thesynchronous UGATE driver is turned on at the beginningof each cycle. After the internal one-shot timer expires,the UGATE driver is turned off. The pulse width of thisone-shot is determined by the converter's input voltageand the output voltage to keep the frequency fairly constantover the input voltage range and output voltage. Anotherone-shot sets a minimum off-time.\nThe RT8816A also features a PWM-VID dynamic voltage\ncontrol circuit driven by the pulse width modulationmethod. This circuit reduces the device pin count andenables a wide dynamic voltage range.\nSoft-Start (SS)\nFor soft-start function, an internal current source charges\nan internal capacitor to build the soft-start ramp voltage.The output voltage will track the internal ramp voltage duringsoft-start interval.\nPGOOD\nThe power good output is an open-drain architecture.\nWhen the soft-start is finished, the PGOOD open-drain\noutput is high impedance.Current Balance\nThe RT8816A implements internal current balance\nmechanism in the current loop. The RT8816A senses perphase current and compares it with the average current. Ifthe sensed current of any particular phase is higher thanaverage current, the on-time of this phase is adjusted tobe shorter.\nCurrent Limit\nThe current limit circuit employs a unique “valley ” current\nsensing algorithm. If the magnitude of the current sensesignal at PHASE is above the current limit threshold, thePWM is not allowed to initiate a new cycle. Thus, thecurrent to the load exceeds average output inductorcurrent, the output voltage falls and eventually crossesthe under-voltage protection threshold, inducing ICshutdown.\nOver-Voltage Protection (OVP) & Under-Voltage\nProtection (UVP)\nThe output voltage is continuously monitored for over-\nvoltage and under-voltage protection. When the outputvoltage exceeds its set voltage threshold (If V\nREFIN ≤ 1.33V,\nOV = 2V, or V REFIN  > 1.33V, OV = 1.5 x V REFIN ), UGATE\ngoes low and LGATE is forced high; when it is less than40% of its set voltage, under voltage protection is triggeredand then both UGATE and LGATE gate drivers are forcedlow. The  controller is latched until PVCC is re-supplied\nand exceeds the POR rising threshold voltage or EN isreset.\nRT8816A\n5DS8816A-07   March  2022 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2022 Richtek Technology Corporation.

A COT (Constant-On-Time) PWM controllerand two MOSFET drivers with internal bootstrap diodesare integrated so that the external circuit can be easilydesigned and the number of component is reduced.\nThe topology solves the poor load transient response timing\nproblems of fixed-frequency mode PWM and avoids theproblems caused by widely varying switching frequenciesin conventional constant on-time and constant off-timePWM schemes. The IC supports dynamic mode transitionfunction with various operating states, which include singlephase with CCM, dual-phase with CCM, single phase withdiode emulation mode and dual-phase with diode emulationmode operation. These different operating states makethe system efficiency as high as possible.\nThe RT8816A provides a PWM-VID dynamic control\noperation in which the feedback voltage is regulated andtracks external input reference voltage. It also featurescomplete fault protection functions including over voltage,under voltage and current limit.\nRemote Sense\nThe RT8816A uses the remote sense path (VSNS andRGND) to overcome voltage drops in the power lines bysensing the voltage directly at the end of GPU. Normally,to protect remote sense path disconnecting, there aretwo resistors (R\nLocal) connecting between local sense path\nand remote sense path. That is, in application with remotesense, the R\nLocal is recommended to be 10 Ω to 100 Ω. If\nno need of remote sense, the R Local is recommended to\nbe 0 Ω.\nOUTON TON\nIN2 V 3.2pT =  RV0 . 5\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf02d\n\uf028\uf029/ SO U T I N O NF=  V V T \uf0b4and then the switching frequency F S is :PWM Operation\nThe RT8816A integrates a Constant-On-Time (COT) PWM\ncontroller, and the controller provides the PWM signalwhich relies on the output ripple voltage comparing withinternal reference voltage as shown in Figure 4. Referringto the function block diagram of TON Genx, thesynchronous \nUGATE driver is turned on at the beginning\nof each cycle. After the internal one-shot timer expires,the UGATE driver is turned off. The pulse width of thisone-shot is determined by the converter input voltage andthe output voltage to keep the frequency fairly constantover the input voltage and output voltage range. Anotherone-shot sets a minimum off-time.\nFigure 3. Output Voltage SensingR\nTON is a resistor connected from the V IN to TON pin.\nThe recommended operation frequency range is from\n250kHz to 750kHz.On-Time Control\nThe on-time one-shot comparator has two inputs. One\ninput monitors the output voltage, while the other inputsamples the input voltage and converts it to a current.This input voltage proportional current is used to chargean internal on-time capacitor. The on-time is the timerequired for the voltage on this capacitor to charge fromzero volts to V\nOUT, thereby making the on-time of the high-\nside switch directly proportional to output voltage andinversely proportional to input voltage. The implementationresults in a nearly constant switching frequency withoutthe need for a clock generator.Figure 4.

When set to 1 phase operation,UGATE2, BOOT2, PHASE2, LGATE2 pins are floating,and the voltage of PSI pin must be set to the 1 phaseoperation threshold. Refer to Table 1 for detail.\nMode Selection\nThe RT8816A can operate into 2 phases with forced\nCCM, 1 phase with forced CCM, 1 phase with DEM and2 phases with DEM according to PSI voltage setting. IfPSI voltage is pulled below 0.4V, the controller operatesinto 1 phase with DEM. In DEM operation, the RT8816Aautomatically reduces the operation frequency at lightload condition for saving power loss. If PSI voltage ispulled between 0.7V to 0.88V, the controller switchesoperation into 1 phase with forced CCM. If PSI voltageis pulled between 1.08V to 1.35V, the controllerswitches operation into 2 phase with DEM. If PSI voltageis pulled between 1.6V to 5.5V, the controller switchesoperation into 2 phase with forced CCM. The operationmode is summarized in Table 1. Moreover, the PSI pinis valid after POR of VR.\nDiode-Emulation Mode\nIn diode-emulation  mode, the RT8816A automatically\nreduces switching frequency at light-load condition tomaintain high efficiency. As the output current decreasesfrom heavy-load condition, the inductor current is alsoreduced, and eventually comes to the point that its valleytouches  zero  current,  which  is  the  boundary  betweencontinuous  conduction  and  discontinuous  conductionmodes. By emulating the behavior of diodes, the low sideMOSFET allows only partial of negative current\n when the\ninductor freewheeling current reaches negative value. Asthe load current is further decreased, it takes a longerFigure 5.

Trade-off in DEM noise vs. light-loadefficiency is made by varying the inductor value. Generally,low inductor values produce a broad high efficiency rangevs. load curve, while higher values result in higher full loadefficiency (assuming that the coil resistance remains fixed)and less output voltage ripple. The disadvantages for usinghigher inductor values include larger physical size anddegraded load-transient response (especially at low inputvoltage levels).IPEAK\nILOAD  = IPEAK/2\ntONSlope = (V IN - VOUT) / L\nt\n0ILtime to discharge the output capacitor to the level that\nrequires the next “ON” cycle. In reverse, when the output\ncurrent increases  from  light  load  to  heavy  load,  theswitching frequency increases to the preset value as theinductor  current  reaches  the  continuous  conductioncondition. The transition load point to the light loadoperation is shown in Figure 5 and can be calculated asfollows:\nForced-CCM Mode\nThe low noise, forced-CCM mode disables the zero-\ncrossing comparator, which controls the low-side switchon-time. This causes the low-side gate drive waveform tobe the complement of the high-side gate drive waveform.This in turn causes the inductor current to reverse at lightloads as the PWM loop to maintain a duty ratio V\nOUT/VIN.\nThe benefit of forced-CCM mode is to keep the switchingfrequency fairly constant.\nRT8816A\n14DS8816A-07   March  2022 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2022 Richtek Technology Corporation.

Internal Soft-Start SequenceEnable and Disable\nThe EN pin is a high impedance input that allows power\nsequencing between the controller bias voltage and\nanother voltage rail. The RT8816A remains in shutdown if\nthe EN pin is lower than 550mV. When the EN voltagerises above the 1.2V high level threshold, the RT8816Abegins a new initialization and soft-start cycle.\nPower On Reset (POR), UVLO\nPower On Reset (POR) occurs when V\nPVCC rises above\napproximately 4.1V (typical), the RT8816A resets the fault\nlatch circuit and prepare for PWM operation. When theV\nPVCC is lower than 3.8V (typical), the Under Voltage\nLockout (UVLO) circuitry inhibits switching by keepingUGATE and LGATE low.\nSoft-Start\nThe RT8816A provides internal soft-start function and\nexternal soft-start function. The soft-start function is usedto prevent large inrush current and output voltage overshootwhile the converter is being powered up. \nThe soft-start\nfunction automatically begins once the chip is enabled.There is a delay time around 200us from EN goes high toV\nOUT begins to ramp-up.\nIf externa l capacitor from OCSET/SS pin to GND is\nremoved, the internal soft-start function is chosen. Aninternal current source charges the internal soft-startcapacitor so that the internal soft-start voltage rampsup linearly. The output voltage will track the internalsoft-start voltage during the soft-start interval. After theinternal soft- start voltage exceeds the REFIN voltage,the output voltage no longer tracks the internal soft-start voltage but follows the REFIN voltage. Therefore,the duty cycle of the UGATE signal as well as the inputcurrent at power up are limited.\nThe soft-start process is finished when the internal SSOK\ngoes high and protection is not triggered. Figure 6 showsthe internal soft-start sequence.The RT8816A also provides external soft-start function,\nand the external soft-start sequence is shown in Figure7, connecting an additional capacitor from OCSET/SS pinto GND. The external capacitor is charged by internalcurrent  source  to  build soft-start voltage ramp. If externalsoft-start function is chosen, the external soft-start timeshould be set longer than internal soft-start time to avoidoutput voltage tracking the internal soft-start ramp. Theexternal soft-start time setting is shown in Figure 8 andthe recommended external soft-start slew rate is from0.1V/ms to  0.4V/ms.EN\nInternal SS\nLGATEUGATE\nPGOODPVCC\nVOUT\nVREFIN\nInternal SSOK\nNormal Soft-startSoft \nDischargedEnable\ndelay time\nEN\nExternal SS\nLGATEUGATE\nPGOODPVCC\nVOUT\nNormal120% VREFIN\nExternal SSOK\nSoft-startSoft \nDischargedEnable\ndelay time\nFigure 7.

During soft-start, the PGOOD is heldlow and is allowed to be pulled high after V\nOUT goes\nover UVP threshold and under OVP threshold. Inaddition, if any protection is triggered during operation,the PGOOD is pulled low immediately.\nPWM VID and Dynamic Output Voltage Control\nThe RT8816A features a PWM VID input for dynamic\noutput voltage control as shown in Figure 9, whichreduces the number of  device pin and enables a widedynamic voltage range. The output voltage is determinedby the applied voltage on the REFIN pin.

The absolute value of negative current limitthreshold is the same as the positive current limitthreshold. If negative inductor current is rising to triggernegative current limit, the low-side MOSFET is turnedoff and the current flows to input side through the bodydiode of the high-side MOSFET. At this time, outputvoltage tends to rise because this protection limitscurrent to discharge the output capacitor. In order toprevent shutdown because of over-voltage protection,the low-side MOSFET is turned on again 400ns after itis turned off. If the device hits the negative current limitthreshold again before output voltage is discharged tothe target level, the low-side MOSFET is turned off andprocess repeats. It ensures maximum allowabledischarge capability when output voltage continues torise. On the other hand, if the output is discharged tothe target level before negative current limit thresholdis reached, the low-side MOSFET is turned off, the high-side MOSFET is then turned on, and the device keepsnormal operation.\nCurrent Balance\nThe RT8816A implements current balance mechanism in\nthe current loop. The RT8816A senses per phase currentsignal and compares it with the average current. If thesensed current of any particular phase is higher than theaverage current, the on-time of this phase is decreased.\nThe current balance accuracy is mainly related with on-\nresistance of low-side MOSFET (R\nLG,DS(ON) ). That is, in\npractical application, using lower R LG,DS(ON)  will reduce\nthe current balance accuracy.\nOutput Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)\nThe output voltage can be continuously monitored for over-\nvoltage protection. If REFIN voltage is lower than 1.33V,the over voltage threshold  follows absolute over voltage2V. If REFIN voltage is higher than 1.33V, the over voltagethreshold follows relative over voltage 1.5 x V\nREFIN. When\nOVP is triggered, UGATE goes low and LGATE is forcedhigh.

A\n5μs delay is used in OVP detection circuit to prevent false\ntrigger.\nOutput Under-Voltage Protection (UVP)\nThe output voltage can be continuously monitored for under-\nvoltage protection. When the output voltage is less than40% of its set voltage, under voltage protection is triggeredand then all UGATE and LGATE gate drivers are forcedlow. There is a 3 μs delay built in the UVP circuit to prevent\nfalse transitions. During soft-start, the UVP blanking timeis equal to PGOOD blanking time.\nMOSFET Gate Driver\nThe RT8816A integrates high current gate drivers for the\nMOSFETs to obtain high efficiency power conversion insynchronous Buck topology. A dead-time is used to preventthe cross conduction for high-side and low-side MOSFETs.Because both the two gate signals are off during the dead-time, the inductor current freewheels through the bodydiode of the low-side MOSFET. The freewheeling currentand the forward voltage of the body diode contribute powerlosses to the converter. The RT8816A employs adaptivedead time control scheme to ensure safe operation withoutsacrificing efficiency. Furthermore, elaborate logic circuitis implemented to prevent cross conduction. For highoutput current applications, two power MOSFETs areusually paralleled to reduce R\nDS(ON) . The gate driver needs\nto provide more current to switch on/off these paralleledMOSFETs. Gate driver with lower source/sink currentcapability results in longer rising/falling time in gate signalsand higher switching loss. The RT8816A embeds highcurrent gate drivers to obtain high efficiency powerconversion.\nMOSFET Selection\nThe majority of power loss in the step-down power\nconversion is due to the loss in the power MOSFETs. Forlow voltage high current applications, the duty cycle ofthe high-side MOSFET is small. Therefore, the switchingloss of the high-side MOSFET is of concern.  PowerMOSFETs with lower total gate charge are preferred insuch kind of application.However, the small duty cycle means the low-side\nMOSFET is on for most of the switching cycle. Therefore,the conduction loss tends to dominate the total powerloss of the converter. To improve the overall efficiency, theMOSFETs with low R\nDS(ON)  are preferred in the circuit\ndesign.  In some cases, more than one MOSFET areconnected in parallel to further decrease the on-stateresistance. However, this depends on the low-sideMOSFET driver capability and the budget.\nInductor Selection\nInductor plays an importance role in step-down converters\nbecause the energy from the input power rail is stored init and then released to the load. From the viewpoint ofefficiency, the DC Resistance (DCR) of inductor shouldbe as small as possible to minimize the copper loss. Inaddition, the inductor occupies most of the board spaceso the size of it is important. Low profile inductors cansave board space especially when the height is limited.However, low DCR and low profile inductors are usuallynot cost effective.\nAdditionally, higher inductance results in lower ripple\ncurrent, which means the lower power loss. However, theinductor current rising time increases with inductance value.This means the transient response will be slower. Therefore,the inductor design is a trade-off between performance,size and cost.\nIn general, inductance is designed to let the ripple current\nranges between 20% to 40% of full load current. Theinductance can be calculated using the following equation :\n\uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4IN OUT OUTmin\nSW OUT_rated INVV VL =  fk I V\nwhere k is the ratio between inductor ripple current and\nrated output current.\nInput Capacitor Selection\nVoltage  rating and current rating are the key parameters\nin selecting input capacitor. Generally, input capacitorvoltage rating should be 1.5 times greater than themaximum input voltage for a conservatively safe design.\nThe input capacitor is used to supply the input RMS\ncurrent, which can be approximately calculated using the\nRT8816A\n19DS8816A-07   March  2022 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2022 Richtek Technology Corporation.

Using more than one capacitor with low EquivalentSeries Resistance (ESR) in parallel to form a capacitorbank is a good design. Besides, placing ceramic capacitorclose to the Drain of the high-side MOSFET is helpful inreducing the input voltage ripple at heavy load.\nOutput Capacitor Selection\nThe output filter capacitor \nmust have ESR low enough\nto meet output ripple and load transient requirement,yet have high enough ESR to satisfy stabilityrequirements. Also, the capacitance must be highenough to absorb the inductor energy going from a fullload to no load condition without tripping the OVPcircuit. Organic semiconductor capacitor(s) or specialpolymer capacitor(s) are recommended.\nThermal Considerations\nThe junction temperature should never exceed the\nabsolute maximum junction temperature T J(MAX) , listed\nunder Absolute Maximum Ratings, to avoid permanentdamage to the device. The maximum allowable powerdissipation depends on the thermal resistance of the ICpackage, the PCB layout, the rate of surrounding airflow,and the difference between the junction and ambienttemperatures. The maximum power dissipation can becalculated using the following formula :\nP\nD(MAX)  = (T J(MAX)  − TA) / θJA\nwhere T J(MAX)  is the maximum junction temperature, T A is\nthe ambient temperature, and θJA is the junction-to-ambient\nthermal resistance.\nFor continuous operation, the maximum operating junction\ntemperature indicated under Recommended OperatingConditions is 105 °C. The junction-to-ambient thermal\nresistance, θ\nJA, is highly package dependent. For a\nWQFN-20L 3x3 package, the thermal resistance, θJA, is\n30°C/W  on a standard JEDEC 51-7 high effective-thermal-\nconductivity four-layer test board. The maximum powerdissipation at T\nA = 25 °C can be calculated as below :Figure 13. Derating Curve of Maximum Power\nDissipationPD(MAX)  = (105 °C − 25°C) / (30 °C/W) = 2.67W for a\nWQFN-20L 3x3 package\nThe maximum power dissipation depends on the operating\nambient temperature for the fixed T J(MAX)  and the thermal\nresistance,  θJA. The derating curves in Figure 13 allows\nthe designer to see the effect of rising ambient temperatureon the maximum power dissipation.\n0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5\n0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0 1 1 0Ambient Temperature (°C)Maximum Power Dissipation (W)  1Four-Layer PCB\nRT8816A\n20DS8816A-07   March  2022 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2022 Richtek Technology Corporation.

If designed improperly, the PCB couldradiate excessive noise and contribute to the converterinstability. Following layout guidelines must be consideredbefore starting a layout for the RT8816A.\n\uf07dPlace the RC filter as close as possible to the PVCCpin.\n\uf07dKeep current limit setting network as close as possibleto the IC. Routing of the network should avoid couplingto high voltage switching node.\n\uf07dConnections from the drivers to the respective gate ofthe high-side or the low-side MOSFET should be asshort as possible to reduce stray inductance.\n\uf07dAll sensitive analog traces and components such asVSNS, RGND, EN, PSI, VID, PGOOD, VREF, TONREFADJ and REFIN should be placed away from highvoltage switching nodes such as PHASE, LGATE,UGATE, or BOOT nodes to avoid coupling. Use internallayer(s) as ground plane(s) and shield the feedback tracefrom power traces and components.\n\uf07dPower sections should connect directly to groundplane(s) using multiple vias as required for currenthandling (including the chip power ground connections).Power components should be placed to minimize loopsand reduce losses.\nRT8816A\n21DS8816A-07   March  2022 www.richtek.com\nRichtek Technology Corporation\n14F, No. 8, Tai Yuen 1st Street, Chupei City\nHsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C.\nTel: (8863)5526789\nRichtek products are sold by description only.
