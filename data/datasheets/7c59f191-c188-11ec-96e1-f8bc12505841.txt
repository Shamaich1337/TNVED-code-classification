### Component Summary: RBP-130+ by Mini-Circuits

#### Key Specifications:
- **Voltage Ratings**: Not explicitly stated; typically RF components do not have standard voltage ratings.
- **Current Ratings**: Not explicitly stated; RF power input is specified.
- **Power Consumption**: RF Power Input: 0.25 W at 25°C.
- **Operating Temperature Range**: -40°C to 85°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range**: -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type**: Shielded case, dimensions 0.35" x 0.35".
- **Special Features**:
  - Good VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio), typically 1.3:1 at passband.
  - High rejection capabilities.
  - Aqueous washable.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level**: Not specified in the provided text.

#### Description:
The RBP-130+ is a bandpass filter designed for RF applications. Its primary function is to allow signals within a specific frequency range (95 to 180 MHz) to pass while attenuating signals outside this range. This is crucial in communication systems to ensure that only desired frequencies are transmitted or received, minimizing interference from unwanted signals.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Base Stations**: Used in cellular and wireless communication systems to filter out unwanted frequencies and ensure clear signal transmission.
- **Harmonic Rejection**: Helps in reducing harmonics generated by transmitters, improving overall signal quality.
- **Transmitters/Receivers**: Essential in RF circuits to maintain signal integrity by filtering out noise and unwanted frequencies.

This component is particularly useful in applications where space is limited due to its small size and shielded design, making it suitable for compact electronic devices in telecommunications and broadcasting.
