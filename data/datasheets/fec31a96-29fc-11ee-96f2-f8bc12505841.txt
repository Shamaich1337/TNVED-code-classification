This pulse-width modulated(PWM) converter operates at a fixed 125kHz switchingfrequency at heavy loads, and automatically switchesto pulse-skipping mode to provide low quiescent cur-rent and high efficiency at light loads. The MAX5035includes internal frequency compensation simplifyingcircuit implementation. The device uses an internal low-on-resistance, high-voltage, DMOS transistor to obtainhigh efficiency and reduce overall system cost. Thisdevice includes undervoltage lockout, cycle-by-cyclecurrent limit, hiccup mode output short-circuit protec-tion, and thermal shutdown.\nThe MAX5035 delivers up to 1A output current. The out-\nput current may be limited by the maximum power dis-sipation capability of the package. External shutdown isincluded, featuring 10µA (typ) shutdown current. TheMAX5035A/B/C versions have fixed output voltages of3.3V, 5V, and 12V, respectively, while the MAX5035D/Eversions have an adjustable output voltage from 1.25Vto 13.2V.\nThe MAX5035 is available in space-saving 8-pin SO\nand 8-pin plastic DIP packages and operates over theautomotive (-40°C to +125°C) temperature range.\nApplications\nAutomotive\nConsumer ElectronicsIndustrialDistributed PowerFeatures\noWide 7.5V to 76V Input Voltage Range\noFixed (3.3V, 5V, 12V) and Adjustable \n(1.25V to 13.2V) Versions\no1A Output Current\noEfficiency Up to 94%\noInternal 0.4Ω High-Side DMOS FET\no270µA Quiescent Current at No Load, 10 µA\nShutdown Current\noInternal Frequency Compensation\noFixed 125kHz Switching Frequency\noThermal Shutdown and Short-Circuit CurrentLimit\no8-Pin SO and PDIP Packages1A, 76V, High-Efficiency MAXPower \nStep-Down DC-DC Converter\nOrdering Information\n19-2988; Rev 5; 5/11PART TEMP RANGEPIN-\nPACKAGEOU TPU T\nVO LTA GE\n( V)\nMAX5035AUSA 0°C to +85°C 8 SO\nMAX5035AUPA 0°C to +85°C 8 PDIP\nMAX5035AASA -40°C to +125°C 8 SO\nM AX 5035AAS A/V + -40°C to +125°C 8 SO3.3\nMAX5035BUSA 0°C to +85°C 8 SO\nMAX5035BUPA 0°C to +85°C 8 PDIP\nMAX5035BASA -40°C to +125°C 8 SO\nM AX 5035BAS A/V + -40°C to +125°C 8 SO5.0\n1\n2\n3\n4BST\nVD\nSGND\nFB8\n7\n6\n5LXTOP VIEW\nVIN\nGND\nON/OFFMAX5035\nSO/PDIPPin Configuration\nMAX5035\nGNDBST\nLXVIN\nSGNDFBD1\n50SQ100\nVD100µHVOUT\n5VVIN\n7.5V TO 76V\n68µF\n0.1µF\n0.1µF68µF\nON\nOFFR1\nR2ON/OFFTypical Operating Circuit/V denotes an automotive qualified part.\n+Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.\nOrdering Information continued at end of data sheet.\nMAX5035\nOrdering Information\n1A, 76V, High-Efficiency MAXPower \nStep-Down DC-DC Converter\nABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nStresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device.

A unique volt-age-mode control scheme with voltage feed-forwardand an internal switching DMOS FET provides high effi-ciency over a wide input voltage range. This pulse-width modulated converter operates at a fixed 125kHzswitching frequency. The device also features automat-ic pulse-skipping mode to provide low quiescent cur-rent and high efficiency at light loads. Under no load,the MAX5035 consumes only 270µA, and in shutdownmode, consumes only 10µA. The MAX5035 also fea-tures undervoltage lockout, hiccup mode output short-circuit protection, and thermal shutdown.\nShutdown Mode\nDrive ON/OFF to ground to shut down the MAX5035.\nShutdown forces the internal power MOSFET off, turnsoff all internal circuitry, and reduces the V\nINsupply cur-\nrent to 10µA (typ). The ON/ OFF rising threshold is\n1.69V (typ). Before any operation begins, the voltage atON/OFF must exceed 1.69V (typ). The ON/ OFF input\nhas 100mV hysteresis.\nUndervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nUse the ON/OFF function to program the UVLO thresh-\nold at the input. Connect a resistive voltage-dividerfrom V\nINto GND with the center node to ON/ OFF as\nshown in Figure 1. Calculate the threshold value byusing the following formula:\nThe minimum recommended V\nUVLO(TH) is 6.5V, 7.5V, and\n13V for the output voltages of 3.3V, 5V, and 12V, respec-\ntively. The recommended value for R2 is less than 1M Ω.\nIf the external UVLO threshold-setting divider is notused, an internal undervoltage-lockout feature monitorsthe supply voltage at V\nINand allows operation to start\nwhen V INrises above 5.2V (typ). This feature can be\nused only when V INrise time is faster than 2ms. For\nslower V INrise time, use the resistive-divider at\nON/OFF.\nBoost High-Side Gate Drive (BST)\nConnect a flying bootstrap capacitor between LX andBST to provide the gate-drive voltage to the high-sideN-channel DMOS switch. The capacitor is alternatelycharged from the internally regulated output voltage VDand placed across the high-side DMOS driver. Use a0.1µF, 16V ceramic capacitor located as close to thedevice as possible.On startup, an internal low-side switch connects LX toground and charges the BST capacitor to VD. Once theBST capacitor is charged, the internal low-side switchis turned off and the BST capacitor voltage providesthe necessary enhancement voltage to turn on thehigh-side switch.\nThermal-Overload Protection\nThe MAX5035 features integrated thermal overload pro-tection. Thermal overload protection limits total powerdissipation in the device, and protects the device in theevent of a fault condition. When the die temperatureexceeds +160°C, an internal thermal sensor signals theshutdown logic, turning off the internal power MOSFETand allowing the IC to cool. The thermal sensor turns theinternal power MOSFET back on after the IC’s die tem-perature cools down to +140°C, resulting in a pulsedoutput under continuous thermal overload conditions.\nApplications Information\nSetting the Output Voltage\nThe MAX5035A/B/C have preset output voltages of 3.3V,5.0V, and 12V, respectively. Connect FB to the presetoutput voltage (see the \nTypical Operating Circuit ).\nThe MAX5035D/E versions offer an adjustable outputvoltage. Set the output voltage with a resistive voltage-divider connected from the circuit’s output to ground(Figure 1). Connect the center node of the divider toFB. Choose R4 less than 15kΩ , then calculate R3 as\nfollows:\nRVROUT312 2\n12 24 =−×(. )\n.VR\nRVUVLO TH () . =+⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟× 11\n218 5\nMAX5035D\nGNDBSTLXVIN\nSGNDFBD1\n50SQ100\nVD100µHVOUT\n5VVIN\n7.5V TO 76V\n68µF\n0.1µF\n0.1µFCOUT\n68µFR1\nR2R3\n41.2kΩ\nR4\n13.3kΩON/OFF\nFigure 1. Adjustable Output Voltage\nMAX5035\n10\nMaxim Integrated\n1A, 76V, High-Efficiency MAXPower \nStep-Down DC-DC Converter\nThe MAX5035 features internal compensation for opti-\nmum closed-loop bandwidth and phase margin. Withthe preset compensation, it is strongly advised to sensethe output immediately after the primary LC.\nInductor Selection\nThe choice of an inductor is guided by the voltage dif-ference between V\nINand V OUT, the required output\ncurrent, and the operating frequency of the circuit. Usean inductor with a minimum value given by:\nwhere: I\nOUTMAX is the maximum output current required, and\nfSWis the operating frequency of 125kHz. Use an induc-\ntor with a maximum saturation current rating equal to at\nleast the peak switch current limit (I LIM). Use inductors\nwith low DC resistance for higher efficiency.\nSelecting a Rectifier\nThe MAX5035 requires an external Schottky rectifier asa freewheeling diode. Connect this rectifier close to thedevice using short leads and short PC board traces.Choose a rectifier with a continuous current ratinggreater than the highest expected output current. Use arectifier with a voltage rating greater than the maximumexpected input voltage, V\nIN. Use a low forward-voltage\nSchottky rectifier for proper operation and high efficien-cy. Avoid higher than necessary reverse-voltageSchottky rectifiers that have higher forward-voltagedrops. Use a Schottky rectifier with forward-voltagedrop (V\nFB) less than 0.45V at +25 °C and maximum load\ncurrent to avoid forward biasing of the internal bodydiode (LX to ground). Internal body diode conductionmay cause excessive junction temperature rise andthermal shutdown. Use Table 1 to choose the properrectifier at different input voltages and output current.\nInput Bypass Capacitor\nThe discontinuous input-current waveform of the buckconverter causes large ripple currents in the inputcapacitor. The switching frequency, peak inductor cur-rent, and the allowable peak-to-peak voltage ripple thatreflects back to the source dictate the capacitancerequirement. The MAX5035 high switching frequencyallows the use of smaller-value input capacitors.\nThe input ripple is comprised of ∆ V\nQ(caused by the\ncapacitor discharge) and ∆VESR(caused by the ESR of\nthe capacitor). Use low-ESR aluminum electrolytic\ncapacitors with high ripple-current capability at the input.Assuming that the contribution from the ESR and capaci-tor discharge is equal to 90% and 10%, respectively, cal-culate the input capacitance and the ESR required for aspecified ripple using the following equations:\nI\nOUT is the maximum output current of the converter\nand f SWis the oscillator switching frequency (125kHz).\nFor example, at V IN= 48V, V OUT = 3.3V, the ESR and\ninput capacitance are calculated for the input peak-to-\npeak ripple of 100mV or less yielding an ESR andcapacitance value of 80mΩ and 51µF, respectively.\nLow-ESR, ceramic, multilayer chip capacitors are recom-mended for size-optimized application. For ceramiccapacitors, assume the contribution from ESR and capaci-tor discharge is equal to 10% and 90%, respectively.\nThe input capacitor must handle the RMS ripple current\nwithout significant rise in temperature. The maximumcapacitor RMS current occurs at about 50% duty cycle.

Diode Selection\nMAX5035\nMaxim Integrated\n11\n1A, 76V, High-Efficiency MAXPower \nStep-Down DC-DC Converter\nEnsure that the ripple specification of the input capaci-\ntor exceeds the worst-case capacitor RMS ripple cur-rent. Use the following equations to calculate the inputcapacitor RMS current:\nI\nPRMS is the input switch RMS current, I AVGIN is the\ninput average current, and η is the converter efficiency.\nThe ESR of aluminum electrolytic capacitors increases\nsignificantly at cold temperatures. Use a 1µF or greatervalue ceramic capacitor in parallel with the aluminumelectrolytic input capacitor, especially for input voltagesbelow 8V.\nOutput Filter Capacitor\nThe worst-case peak-to-peak and RMS capacitor ripplecurrent, allowable peak-to-peak output ripple voltage,and the maximum deviation of the output voltage dur-ing load steps determine the capacitance and the ESRrequirements for the output capacitors.\nThe output capacitance and its ESR form a zero, which\nimproves the closed-loop stability of the buck regulator.Choose the output capacitor so the ESR zero frequency(f\nZ) occurs between 20kHz to 40kHz. Use the following\nequation to verify the value of f Z. Capacitors with 100mΩ\nto 250mΩ ESR are recommended to ensure the closed-\nloop stability, while keeping the output ripple low.\nThe output ripple is comprised of ∆VOQ(caused by the\ncapacitor discharge) and ∆V OESR (caused by the ESR\nof the capacitor). Use low-ESR tantalum or aluminum\nelectrolytic capacitors at the output. Assuming that thecontributions from the ESR and capacitor dischargeequal 80% and 20% respectively, calculate the outputcapacitance and the ESR required for a specified rip-ple using the following equations:\nThe MAX5035 has an internal soft-start time (t\nSS) of\n400µs. It is important to keep the output rise time at\nstartup below t SSto avoid output overshoot. The output\nrise time is directly proportional to the output capacitor.Use 68µF or lower capacitance at the output to controlthe overshoot below 5%.\nIn a dynamic load application, the allowable deviation\nof the output voltage during the fast-transient load dic-tates the output capacitance value and the ESR. Theoutput capacitors supply the step load current until thecontroller responds with a greater duty cycle. Theresponse time (t\nRESPONSE ) depends on the closed-\nloop bandwidth of the converter. The resistive dropacross the capacitor ESR and capacitor dischargecause a voltage droop during a step load. Use a com-bination of low-ESR tantalum and ceramic capacitorsfor better transient load and ripple/noise performance.Keep the maximum output-voltage deviation above thetolerable limits of the electronics being powered.Assuming a 50% contribution each from the outputcapacitance discharge and the ESR drop, use the fol-lowing equations to calculate the required ESR andcapacitance value:\nwhere I\nSTEP is the load step and t RESPONSE is the\nresponse time of the controller. Controller response\ntime is approximately one-third of the reciprocal of theclosed-loop unity-gain bandwidth, 20kHz typically.\nPCB Layout Considerations\nProper PCB layout is essential. Minimize ground noiseby connecting the anode of the Schottky rectifier, theinput bypass capacitor ground lead, and the output fil-ter capacitor ground lead to a single point (“star”CIt\nVOUTSTEP RESPONSE\nOQ=×\n∆ESRV\nIOUTOESR\nSTEP=∆CI\nVfOUTL\nOQ SW≈××∆\n∆ 22.ESRV\nIOUTOESR\nL=∆\n∆\nfC ESRZ\nOUT OUT=×× ×1\n2πII I I ID\nIVPRMS PK DC PK DC\nAVGIN=+ + × () () ×\n=22\n3\nOOUT OUT\nIN\nPK OUTLDC OUTLI\nV\nIIIIII×\n×\n=+ =−η\n∆∆\n22,\nandDV\nVOUT\nIN=II ICRMS PRMS AVGIN=−2 2 2\nwhere :\nMAX5035\n12\nMaxim Integrated\n1A, 76V, High-Efficiency MAXPower \nStep-Down DC-DC Converter\nground configuration).

Also, place BST and VD bypass capacitorsvery close to the device.
