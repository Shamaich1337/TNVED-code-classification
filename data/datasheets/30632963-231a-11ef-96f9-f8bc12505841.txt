Design flexibility is provided \nby the excellent device characteristics; 300μV Max offset and only 375μA (typical at 60V) of current consumption. The L TC6101 operates on supplies from 4V to 60V and L TC6101HV operates on supplies from 5V to 100V .\nThe L TC6101 monitors current via the voltage across an \nexternal sense resistor (shunt resistor). Internal circuitry converts input voltage to output current, allowing for a small sense signal on a high common mode voltage to be translated into a ground referenced signal. Low DC offset allows the use of a small shunt resistor and large gain-setting resistors. As a result, power loss in the shunt is reduced.\nThe wide operating supply range and high accuracy make \nthe L TC6101 ideal for a large array of applications from automotive to industrial and power management. A maxi-mum input sense voltage of 500mV allows a wide range of currents to be monitored. The fast response makes the L TC6101 the per\nfect choice for load current warnings and \nshutoff protection control.  With very low supply current, the L TC6101 is suitable for power sensitive applications.\nThe L TC6101 is available in 5-lead SOT-23 and 8-lead \nMSOP packages.n Current Shunt Measurement\nn Battery Monitoring\nn Remote Sensing\nn Power Managementn Supply Range: \n  5V to 100V, 105V Absolute Maximum (LTC6101HV)  \n  4V to 60V , 70V Absolute Maximum (L TC6101)\nn Low Offset Voltage: 300μV Max\nn Fast Response: 1μs Response Time (0V to 2.5V on  \n a 5V Output Step)\nn Gain Configurable with 2 Resistors\nn Low Input Bias Current: 170nA Max\nn PSRR: 118dB Min\nn Output Current: 1mA Max\nn Low Supply Current: 250μA, V  S = 12V\nn Specified Temperature Range: –40°C to 125°C\nn Operating Temperature Range: –55°C to 125°C\nn Package Option for High Voltage Spacing\nn Low Profile (1mm) SOT-23 (ThinSOT™) Package\nAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\nLTC6101/LTC6101HV2\nRev IFor more information www.analog.comhttp://www.linear .com/product/L TC6101#orderinfoABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nORDER INFORMATIONTotal Supply Voltage (V+ to V–) \n L TC6101  ...............................................................  70V \n L TC6101HV  ........................................................  105V\nMinimum Input Voltage (–\nIN Pin)  ....................

The system load current will cause both heat and voltage loss in R\nSENSE . As a result, the sense resis -\ntor should be as small as possible while still providing the input dynamic range required by the measurement. Note that input dynamic range is the difference between the maximum \ninput signal and the minimum accurately \nreproduced signal, and is limited primarily by input DC offset of the internal amplifier of the L TC6101. In addition, R\nSENSE  must be small enough that V SENSE  does not exceed \nthe maximum input voltage specified by the L TC6101, even under peak load conditions. As an example, an application may require that the maximum sense voltage be 100mV . If this application is expected to draw 2A at peak load, R\nSENSE  should be no more than 50mΩ.\nOnce the maximum R SENSE  value is determined, the mini -\nmum sense resistor value will be set by the resolution or dynamic range required. The minimum signal that can be accurately represented by this sense amp is limited by the input offset. As an example, the L TC6101B has a typical \ninput offset of 150µ\nV . If the minimum current is 20mA, a \nsense resistor of 7.5mΩ will set V SENSE  to 150µV . This is \nthe same value as the input offset. A larger sense resistor will reduce the error due to offset by increasing the sense voltage for a given load current.\nChoosing a 50mΩ R\nSENSE  will maximize the dynamic range \nand provide a system that has 100mV across the sense \nresistor at peak load (2A), while input offset causes an error equivalent to only 3mA of load current. Peak dissipation is 200mW . If a 5mΩ sense resistor is employed, then the effective current error is 30mA, while the peak sense voltage is reduced to 10mV at 2A, dis -\nsipating only 20mW .\nThe low offset and corresponding large \ndynamic range of \nthe L TC6101 make it more flexible than other solutions in \nthis respect. The 150µV typical offset gives 60dB of dy -\nnamic range for a sense voltage that is limited to 150mV max, and over 70dB of dynamic range if the rated input maximum of 500mV is allowed.\nSense Resistor Connection\nKelvin connection of the IN\n– and IN+ inputs to the sense \nresistor should be used in all but the lowest power ap -\nplications. Solder connections and PC board interconnec -\ntions that carry high current can cause significant error \nin measurement due to their relatively large resistances. One 10mm x 10mm square trace of one-ounce copper is approximately 0.5mΩ. A 1mV error can be caused by as little as 2A flowing through this small inter connect. \nThis will cause a 1% error in a 100mV signal. A 10A load current in the same inter\nconnect will cause a 5% error \nfor the same 100mV signal. By isolating the sense traces from the high-current paths, this error can be reduced by orders of magnitude. A sense resistor with integrated Kelvin sense terminals will give the best results.

Since I OUT = VSENSE /RIN, \ntransconductance g m = 1/R IN. For example, if R IN = 100, \nthen I OUT = VSENSE /100 or I OUT = 1mA for V SENSE = 100mV .\nRIN should be chosen to allow the required resolution \nwhile limiting the output current. At low supply voltage, \nIOUT may be as much as 1mA. By setting R IN such that \nthe largest expected sense voltage gives I OUT = 1mA, then \nthe maximum output dynamic range is available. Output dynamic range is limited by both the maximum allowed output current and the maximum allowed output voltage, as well as the minimum practical output signal. If less dynamic range is required, then R\nIN can be increased accordingly, \nreducing the max output current and power dissipation. If low sense currents must be resolved accurately in a system that has very wide dynamic range, a smaller R\nIN \nthan the max current spec allows may be used if the max current is limited in another way, such as with a Schottky diode across R\nSENSE  (Figure 3a). This will reduce the high \ncurrent measurement accuracy by limiting the result, while increasing the low current measurement resolution.\nFigure 3b.

Shunt Diode Limits Maximum Input Voltage to Allow \nBetter Low Input Resolution Without Overranging\nThis approach can be helpful in cases where occasional \nlarge burst currents may be ignored. It can also be used in a multirange configuration where a low current circuit is added to a high current circuit (Figure 3b). Note that a comparator (L TC1540) is used to select the range, and transistor M1 limits the voltage across R\nSENSE LO .\nCare should be taken when designing the board layout for R\nIN, especially for small R IN values. All trace and inter -\nconnect impedances will increase the effective R IN value, \ncausing a gain error . In addition, internal device resistance will add approximately 0.2Ω to R\nIN.\nLTC6101/LTC6101HV12\nRev IFor more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSelection of External Output Resistor , R OUT\nThe output resistor , R OUT, determines how the output cur -\nrent is converted to voltage. V OUT is simply I OUT • ROUT. \nIn choosing an output resistor , the max output voltage \nmust first be considered. If the circuit that is driven by the output does not limit the output voltage, then R\nOUT \nmust be chosen such that the max output voltage does not exceed the L TC6101 max output voltage rating. If the following circuit is a buffer or ADC with limited input range, then R\nOUT must be chosen so that I OUT(MAX) • ROUT is less \nthan the allowed maximum input range of this circuit.\nIn addition, the output impedance is determined by R OUT. If \nthe circuit to be driven has high enough input impedance, \nthen almost any useful output impedance will be accept -\nable. However , if the driven circuit has relatively low input impedance, or draws spikes of current, such as an ADC might do, then a lower R\nOUT value may be required in order \nto preserve the accuracy of the output. As an example, if the input impedance of the driven circuit is 100 times R\nOUT, \nthen the accuracy of V OUT will be reduced by 1% since:\n  VOUT=IOUT•ROUT•RIN(DRIVEN)\nROUT+RIN(DRIVEN)\n=IOUT•ROUT•100\n101= 0.99 •IOUT•ROUT\nError Sources\nThe current sense system uses an amplifier and resistors \nto apply gain and level shift the result. The output is then dependent on the characteristics of the amplifier , such as gain and input offset, as well as resistor matching. \nIdeally, the circuit output is: \n  VOUT= VSENSE •ROUT\nRIN;VSENSE = RSENSE •ISENSE\nIn this case, the only error is due to resistor mismatch, \nwhich provides an error in gain only. However , offset voltage, bias current and finite gain in the amplifier cause additional errors:Output Error , E\nOUT, Due to the Amplifier DC Offset \nVoltage, V OS\n EOUT(VOS)  = V OS • (R OUT/RIN)\nThe DC offset voltage of the amplifier adds directly to the \nvalue of the sense voltage, V SENSE . This is the dominant \nerror of the system and it limits the available dynamic range. The paragraph “Selection of External Current Sense Resistor” provides details.\nOutput Error , E\nOUT, Due to the Bias Currents,  \nIB(+) and I B(–) \nThe bias current I B(+) flows into the positive input of the \ninternal op amp.

In applications where R SENSE < \nRIN, the bias current error can be similarly reduced if an \nexternal resistor R IN(+) = (R IN – R SENSE ) is connected as \nshown in Figure 4 below.

For less sensitive designs, R IN+ is \nnot necessary. \nExample: If an I\nSENSE  range = (1A to 1mA) and (V OUT/ISENSE ) =  \n3V/1AThen, from the Electrical Characteristics of the L TC6101, \nR\nSENSE  ≈ V SENSE  (max) / I SENSE  (max) = 500mV/1A = \n500mΩGain = R\nOUT/RIN = V OUT (max) / V SENSE  (max) =  \n3V/500mV = 6If the maximum output current, I\nOUT, is limited to 1mA, \nROUT equals  3V/1mA ≈ 3.01 kΩ (1% value) and R IN =  \n3kΩ/6 ≈ 499Ω (1% value).The output error due to DC offset is ±900µV\nolts (typ) and \nthe error due to offset current, I OS is 3k x 2nA = ±6µVolts \n(typical), provided R IN+ = R IN–.\nThe maximum output error can therefore reach ±906µVolts \nor 0.03% (–70dB) of the output full scale. Considering the system input 60dB dynamic range (I\nSENSE  = 1mA to \n1A), the 70dB performance of the L TC6101 makes this application feasible.\nOutput Error , E\nOUT, Due to the Finite DC Open Loop \nGain, A OL, of the L TC6101 Amplifier \nThis error is inconsequential as the A OL of the L TC6101 \nis very large.\nOutput Current Limitations Due to Power Dissipation \nThe L TC6101 can deliver up to 1mA continuous current to \nthe output pin. This current flows through R IN and enters the \ncurrent sense amp via the IN(–) pin. The power dissipated in the L TC6101 due to the output signal is:\n POUT = (V –IN – V OUT) • IOUT\n Since V –IN ≈ V+, POUT ≈ (V+ – V OUT) • IOUT\nThere is also power dissipated due to the quiescent sup-\nply current:\n PQ = IDD • V+The total power dissipated is the output dissipation plus \nthe quiescent dissipation:\n PTOTAL  = P OUT + P Q\nAt maximum supply and maximum output current, the total power dissipation can exceed 100mW . This will cause significant heating of the L TC6101 die. In order to prevent damage to the L TC6101, the maximum expected dissipation in each application should be calculated. This number can be multiplied by the θ\nJA value listed in the \npackage section on page 2 to find the maximum expected die temperature. This must not be allowed to exceed 150°C, or performance may be degraded.\nAs an example, if an L TC6101 in the S5 package is to be \nrun at 55V ±5V supply with 1mA output current at 80°C:\n PQ(MAX)  = IDD(MAX)  • V+(MAX)  = 41.4mW\n POUT(MAX)  = IOUT • V+(MAX)  = 60mW\n TRISE = θJA • PTOTAL(MAX)\n TMAX = TAMBIENT  + TRISE\n TMAX must be < 150°C\n PTOTAL(MAX)  ≈ 96mW and the max die temp  \n will be 104°C\nIf this same circuit must run at 125°C, the max die  \ntemp will increase to 150°C. (Note that supply current,  \nand therefore P Q, is proportional to temperature. Refer \nto Typical Performance Characteristics section.) In this \ncondition, the maximum output current should be reduced to avoid device damage. Note that the MSOP package has a larger θ\nJA than the S5, so additional care must be \ntaken when operating the L TC6101A/L TC6101HVA at high temperatures and high output currents.\nThe L TC6101HV can be used at voltages up to 105V . This \nadditional voltage requires that more power be dissipated for a given level of current. This will further limit the allowed output current at high ambient temperatures.\nIt is important to note that the L TC6101 has been designed \nto provide at least 1mA to the output when required, and can deliver more depending on the conditions. Care must be taken to limit the maximum output current by proper choice of sense resistor and, if input fault conditions exist, \nexternal clamps.\nLTC6101/LTC6101HV14\nRev IFor more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOutput Filtering\nThe output voltage, V OUT, is simply I OUT • ZOUT. This \nmakes filtering straightforward. Any circuit may be used \nwhich generates the required Z OUT to get the desired filter  \nresponse. For example, a capacitor in parallel with R OUT \nwill give a low pass response. This will reduce unwanted noise from the output, and may also be useful as a charge reservoir to keep the output steady while driving a switch -\ning circuit such as a mux or ADC.

Not only does this allow a wide V\nSENSE  range, it also allows the input refer -\nence to be separate from the positive supply (Figure 5). Note that the difference \nbetween V BATT and V+ must be no \nmore than the common mode range listed in the Electrical Characteristics table. If the maximum V\nSENSE  is less than \n500mV , the L TC6101 may monitor its own supply current, as well as that of the load (Figure 6).\nLTC6101/LTC6101HV15\nRev IFor more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nReverse Supply Protection\nSome applications may be tested with reverse-polarity \nsupplies due to an expectation of this type of fault during operation. The L TC6101 is not protected internally from external reversal of supply polarity. To prevent damage that may occur during this condition, a Schottky diode should be added in series with V\n– (Figure 7). This will limit the \nreverse current through the L TC6101. Note that this diode will limit the low voltage performance of the L TC6101 by effectively reducing the supply voltage to the part by V\nD.\nIn addition, if the output of the L TC6101 is wired to a device that will effectively short it to high voltage (such as through an ESD protection clamp) during a reverse supply condi -\ntion, the L TC6101’s output should be connected through a resistor or Schottky diode (Figure 8).\nResponse T ime\nThe L\nTC6101 is designed to exhibit fast response to inputs \nfor the purpose of circuit protection or signal transmission. \nThis response time will be affected by the external circuit in two ways, delay and speed.\nIf the output current is very low and an input transient \noccurs, there may be an increased delay before the output voltage begins changing. This can be improved by increas -\ning the minimum output current, either by increasing \nR\nSENSE  or decreasing R IN. The effect of increased output \ncurrent is illustrated in the step response curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section of this data sheet. Note that the curves are labeled with respect to the \ninitial output currents.\nThe speed is also affected by the external circuit. In this \ncase, if the input changes very quickly, the internal ampli -\nfier will slew the gate of the internal output FET (Figure 1)  \nin order to maintain the internal loop. This results in cur -\nrent flowing through R\nIN and the internal FET . This current \nslew rate will be determined by the amplifier and FET characteristics as well as the input resistor , R\nIN. Using a \nsmaller R IN will allow the output current to increase more \nquickly, decreasing the response time at the output. This will also have the effect of increasing the maximum output current. Using a larger R\nOUT will decrease the response \ntime, since V OUT = IOUT • ROUT. Reducing R IN and increas -\ning R OUT will both have the effect of increasing the voltage \ngain of the circuit.\nHigh Voltage Spacing\nFor applications with higher voltage, the TSOT-23 HV \npinout of the L TC6101HV eases the printed circuit board (PCB) layout burden. In the typical high side current sense configuration, the sense voltages will be at or very near the supply; normally the sense difference voltage is small. Therefore V\n+, +IN and –IN will be roughly the same \nvoltage. The TSOT-23 HV pinout provides connection for these three pins on the left side (Top View). Because volt -\nage differences between these high side pins and the OUT and V\n– pin may be high, the OUT and V– pin lie separately, \non the right side of the package.\nFigure 7.

#### Description:
The LTC6101AIMS8#PBF is a high voltage, high-side current sense amplifier designed for accurate current measurement in various applications. It operates by monitoring the voltage across an external sense resistor (shunt resistor) and converting this voltage into a ground-referenced output current. The device features low offset voltage and low supply current, making it suitable for power-sensitive applications.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Current Shunt Measurement:** Used to monitor current in automotive and industrial applications.
- **Battery Monitoring:** Ideal for applications requiring precise battery current measurements.
- **Remote Sensing:** Suitable for applications where the sensing element is located away from the measurement circuitry.
- **Power Management:** Effective in systems requiring accurate load current monitoring for power management and control.

The LTC6101 is particularly useful in high common mode voltage environments, allowing for accurate current sensing without significant power loss in the shunt resistor. Its fast response time makes it suitable for applications requiring quick load current warnings and shutoff protection control.
