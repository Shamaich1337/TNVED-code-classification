The IDT82V2058\ncontains 8 transmitters and 8 receivers.\nAll the receivers and transmitters can be programmed to work either\nin Single Rail mode or Dual Rail  mode. HDB3 or AMI encoder/decoder is\nselectable in Single Rail mode. Pre-encoded transmit data in NRZ\nformat can be accepted when the dev ice is configured in Dual Rail\nmode. The receivers perform clock and data recovery by using inte-\ngrated digital phase-locked loop. As an option, the raw sliced data (no\nretiming) can be output on the receiv e data pins. Transmit equalization is\nimplemented with low-impedance out put drivers that provide shaped\nwaveforms to the transformer, guaranteeing template conformance.\nA jitter attenuator is integrated in the IDT82V2058 and can be\nswitched into either the transmit path  or the receive path for all channels.\nThe jitter attenuation performance meets ETSI CTR12/13, ITU G.736,\nG.742 and G.823 specifications.The IDT82V2058 offers hardware c ontrol mode and software control\nmode. Software control mode works with  either serial host interface or\nparallel host interface. The latter wo rks via an Intel/Motorola compatible\n8-bit parallel interface for both multiplexed or non-multiplexed applica-\ntions. Hardware control mode uses multiplexed pins to select differentoperation modes when the host interfac e is not available to the device.\nThe IDT82V2058 also provides  loopback and JTAG boundary scan\ntesting functions. Using the integrated monitoring function, the\nIDT82V2058 can be configured as a 7-channel transceiver with non-\nintrusive protected monitoring points.\nThe IDT82V2058 can be used for SDH/SONET multiplexers, central\noffice or PBX, digital access cross connects, digital radio base stations,\nremote wireless modules and microwave transmission systems.\nPIN CONFIGURATIONS\nFigure-2   TQFP144 Package Pin AssignmentIDT82V2058\n(Top View)1\n23\n4\n567\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n131415\n16\n17181920\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25262728\n29\n303132\n33\n34\n35\n3672\n71\n70\n69\n6867\n6665\n64\n63\n62\n61\n6059\n58\n57\n56\n55\n5453\n52\n51\n50\n49\n4847\n46\n45\n44\n43\n4241\n40\n39\n38\n37108107106105104\n103\n102\n101\n100\n99\n98979695\n94\n939291\n90\n89\n88\n87\n86858483\n82\n818079\n78\n77\n76\n75\n74\n73109110\n111\n112\n113\n114115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n128129\n130\n131\n132\n133\n134135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140141\n142\n143\n144\nTD7/TDP7\nTCLK7\nLOS6\nCV6/RDN6\nRD6/RDP6\nRCLK6\nBPVI6/TDN6\nTD6/TDP6\nTCLK6\nMCLK\nMODE2\nA4\nMC3/A3MC2/A2\nMC1/A1\nMC0/A0\nVDDIO\nGNDIO\nVDDD\nGNDD\nLP0/D0/AD0LP1/D1/AD1\nLP2/D2/AD2\nLP3/D3/AD3LP4/D4/AD4LP5/D5/AD5LP6/D6/AD6\nLP7/D7/AD7\nTCLK1\nTD1/TDP1\nBPVI1/TDN1\nRCLK1\nRD1/RDP1CV1/RDN1\nLOS1\nTCLK0BPVI3/TDN3\nRCLK3\nRD3/RDP3\nCV3/RDN3\nLOS3\nRTIP3\nRRING3VDDT3\nTTIP3\nTRING3\nGNDT3\nRRING2\nRTIP2GNDT2\nTRING2\nTTIP2\nVDDT2\nRTIP1\nRRING1VDDT1\nTTIP1\nTRING1\nGNDT1\nRRING0\nRTIP0GNDT0\nTRING0\nTTIP0\nVDDT0\nMODE1\nLOS0\nCV0/RDN0\nRD0/RDP0\nRCLK0\nBPVI0/TDN0\nTD0/TDP0TD4/TDP4TCLK4\nLOS5\nCV5/RDN5RD5/RDP5\nRCLK5\nBPVI5/TDN5\nTD5/TDP5TCLK5TDITDO\nTCK\nTMSTRSTIC\nIC\nVDDIO\nGNDIO\nVDDA\nGNDAMODE0/CODECS/JAS\nSCLK/ALE/ AS\nRD/R/W\nSDI/ WR/DS\nSDO/RDY/ ACK\nINT\nTCLK2\nTD2/TDP2\nBPVI2/TDN2\nRCLK2\nRD2/RDP2CV2/RDN2LOS2TCLK3\nTD3/TDP3\nBPVI4/TDN4\nRCLK4\nRD4/RDP4\nCV4/RDN4\nLOS4\nOE\nCLKE\nVDDT4\nTTIP4\nTRING4\nGNDT4\nRTIP4\nRRING4\nGNDT5\nTRING5\nTTIP5\nVDDT5\nRRING5\nRTIP5\nVDDT6\nTTIP6\nTRING6\nGNDT6\nRTIP6\nRRING6\nGNDT7\nTRING7\nTTIP7\nVDDT7\nRRING7\nRTIP7\nLOS7\nCV7/RDN7\nRD7/RDP7\nRCLK7\nBPVI7/TDN7\n\n3IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\nFigure-3   PBGA160 Package Pin AssignmentVDDT\n4TRING\n4GNDT\n4RTIP\n4RTIP\n7GNDT\n7TRING\n7VDDT\n7RDN\n7\nRCLK\n4RDP\n4RDN\n4RDP\n7RCLK\n7\nVDDT\n5TRING\n5GNDT\n5RTIP\n5RTIP\n6GNDT\n6VDDT\n6RDN\n6\nRCLK\n5RDP\n5RDN\n5RDP\n6RCLK\n6\nVDDT\n5TTIP\n5GNDT\n5RRING\n5RRING\n6GNDT\n6TTIP\n6VDDT\n6TDN\n6\nTCLK\n5TDP\n5TDN\n5TDP\n6TCLK\n6\nLOS\n4LOS\n7LOS\n6\nOECLKELOS\n5MODE\n2MCLK\nTMSA4MC\n3\nTCKTDOTDIMC\n2MC\n1\nGNDIOGNDIOMC\n0\nVDDIOICTRSTLP\n0VDDIO\nGNDAGNDDLP\n1\nVDDAICMODE\n0LP\n2VDDD\nCSLP\n3LP\n4\nSDIRDSCLKLP\n5LP\n6\nLOS\n3LOS\n0LOS\n1\nSDOINTLOS\n2MODE\n1LP\n7\nVDDT\n2TTIP\n2GNDT\n2RRING\n2RRING\n1GNDT\n1TTIP\n1VDDT\n1TDN\n1\nTCLK\n2TDP\n2TDN\n2TDP\n1TCLK\n1\nVDDT\n2TRING\n2GNDT\n2RTIP\n2RTIP\n1GNDT\n1TRING\n1VDDT\n1RDN\n1\nRCLK\n2RDP\n2RDN\n2RDP\n1RCLK\n1\nVDDT\n3TTIP\n3GNDT\n3RRING\n0GNDT\n0TTIP\n0VDDT\n0TDN\n0\nTCLK\n3TDP\n3TDN\n3TDP\n0TCLK\n0\nVDDT\n3TRING\n3GNDT\n3RTIP\n3RTIP\n0GNDT\n0TRING\n0VDDT\n0RDN\n0\nRCLK\n3RDP\n3RDN\n3RDP\n0RCLK\n0\nVDDT\n7\nTTIP\n7\nGNDT\n7\nRRING\n7\nRRING\n4\nGNDT\n4\nTTIP\n4\nVDDT\n4\nTDN\n4TCLK\n7\nTDP\n7\nTDN\n7\nTDP\n4\nTCLK\n4TRING\n6\nIDT82V2058\n(Bottom View)RRING\n3A            B            C            D            E            F            G           H            J            K            L            M           N           P\nA            B            C            D            E            F            G           H            J            K            L            M           N           P1\n234\n5\n6789\n101112\n13\n141\n2345\n6\n789\n10111213\n14\n\n4IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\n1 PIN DESCRIPTION\nTable-1 Pin Description\nName TypePin No.\nDescription\nTQFP144 PBGA160\nTransmit and Receive Line Interface\nTTIP0\nTTIP1TTIP2\nTTIP3\nTTIP4TTIP5\nTTIP6\nTTIP7\nTRING0\nTRING1TRING2\nTRING3\nTRING4TRING5\nTRING6\nTRING7Analog \nOutput 45\n5257\n64\n117124\n129\n136\n46\n5158\n63\n118123\n130\n135N5\nL5\nL10\nN10\nB10D10\nD5\nB5\nP5\nM5\nM10\nP10\nA10C10\nC5\nA5TTIPn/TRINGn: Transmit Bipolar Tip/Ring for Channel 0~7\nThese pins are the differential line driver outputs.

Data on TDn is \nsampled into the device on the falling edges of TCLKn, and encoded by AMI or HDB3 line code rules before being transmitted to the line.\nBPVIn: Bipolar Violation Insertion for Channel 0~7\nBipolar violation insertion is available in Single Rail mode 2 ( see Table-2 on page 13 and Table-3 on page \n14) with AMI enabled. A low-to-high transition on this pin will make the next logic one to be transmitted on \nTDn the same polarity as the previous pulse, and violate the AMI rule. This is for testing.\nTDPn/TDNn: Positive/Negative Transmit Data for Channel 0~7\nWhen the device is in Dual Rail Mode, the NRZ data to be transmitted for positive/negative pulse is input on this pin. Data on TDPn/TDNn are sampled on the falling edges of TCLKn. The line code in dual rail \nmode is as the follow:\nPulling pin TDNn high for more than 16 consecutive TCLK clock cycles will configure the corresponding \nchannel into Single Rail mode 1 (see Table-2 on page 13  and Table-3 on page 14 ).\nTCLK0\nTCLK1\nTCLK2\nTCLK3TCLK4\nTCLK5\nTCLK6TCLK7I36\n29\n81\n74\n107\n100\n92N1\nL1\nL14\nN14B14\nD14\nD1B1TCLKn: Transmit Clock for Channel 0~7\nThe clock of 2.048 MHz for transmit is input on this pin. The transmit data at TDn/TDPn or TDNn is sam-\npled into the device on the falling edges of TCLKn.Pulling TCLKn high for more than 16 MCLK cycles, the corresponding transmitter is set in Transmit All \nOnes (TAOS) state (when MCLK is clocked). In TA OS state, the TAOS generator adopts MCLK as the \nclock reference.If TCLKn is low, the corresponding transmit channel is set into power down state, while driver output ports \nbecome high-Z.\nDifferent combinations of TCLKn and MCLK result in different transmit mode.

However, only bipolar violation is indicated when AMI decoder is selected.\nRDPn/RDNn: Positive/Negative Receive Data for Channel 0~7\nIn Dual Rail Mode with clock recovery, these pins ou tput the NRZ data. A high signal on RDPn indicates \nthe receipt of a positive pulse on RTIPn/RRINGn while a high signal on RDNn indicates the receipt of a \nnegative pulse on RTIPn/RRINGn.\nThe output data at RDn or RDPn/RDNn are clocked out on the falling edges of RCLK when the CLKE input is low, or are clocked out on the rising edges of RCLK when CLKE is high.\nIn Dual Rail Mode without clock recovery, these pins output the raw RZ sliced data. In this data recovery \nmode, the active polarity of RDPn/RDNn is determi ned by pin CLKE. When pin CLKE is low, RDPn/RDNn \nis active low. When pin CLKE is high, RDPn/RDNn is active high.\nIn hardware mode, RDn or RDPn/RDNn will remain active during LOS. In host mode, these pins will either \nremain active or insert alarm indication signal (AIS) into the receive path, determined by bit AISE in regis-ter GCF .\nRDn or RDPn/RDNn is set into high-Z when the corresponding receiver is powered down.\nRCLK0\nRCLK1\nRCLK2\nRCLK3RCLK4\nRCLK5\nRCLK6RCLK7O\nHigh-Z39\n32\n78\n71\n110\n103\n6\n143P1\nM1\nM14\nP14\nA14\nC14\nC1A1RCLKn: Receive Clock for Channel 0~7\nIn clock recovery mode, this pin outputs the recovered clock from signal received on RTIPn/RRINGn. The received data are clocked out of the device on the rising edges of RCLKn if pin CLKE is high, or on falling \nedges of RCLKn if pin CLKE is low.\nIn data recovery mode, RCLKn is the output of an internal exclusive OR (XOR) which is connected with RDPn and RDNn. The clock is recovered from the signal on RCLKn.\nIf Receiver n is powered down, the corresponding RCLKn is in high-Z.\nMCLK I 10 E1MCLK: Master Clock\nThis is an independent, free running reference clock. A clock of 2.048 MHz is supplied to this pin as the clock reference of the device for normal operation.\nIn receive path, when MCLK is high, the device slices the incoming bipolar line signal into RZ pulse (Data \nRecovery mode). When MCLK is low, all the receivers are powered down, and the output pins RCLKn, RDPn and RDNn are switched to high-Z.\nIn transmit path, the operation mode is decided by the combination of MCLK and TCLKn (see TCLKn pin \ndescription for details).NOTE: Wait state generation via RDY/ ACK is not available if MCLK is not provided.\nLOS0\nLOS1LOS2\nLOS3\nLOS4LOS5\nLOS6\nLOS7O42\n3575\n68\n113106\n3\n140K4\nK3\nK12\nK11\nE11E12\nE3\nE4LOSn: Loss of Signal Output for Channel 0~7\nA high level on this pin indicates the loss of signal when there is no transition over a specified period of \ntime or no enough ones density in the received signal.

The receiver performs clock and data recovery. As anoption, the raw sliced data (no reti ming) can be output to the system.\nTransmit equalization is implemented with low-impedance output drivers\nthat provide shaped waveforms to the transformer, guaranteeingtemplate conformance. A selectable jitter attenuator may be placed in\nthe receive path or the transmit path.  Moreover, multiple testing func-\ntions, such as error detection, loopback and JTAG boundary scan arealso provided. The device is optim ized for flexible software control\nthrough a serial or parallel host mode in terface. Hardware control is also\navailable. Figure-1 on page 1  shows one of the eight identical channels\noperation.\n2.1.1 SYSTEM INTERFACE\nThe system interface of each cha nnel can be configured to operate\nin different modes: \n1. Single rail interface with clock recovery.\n2. Dual rail interface with clock recovery.\n3. Dual rail interface with data recovery (that is, with raw data \nslicing only and without clock recovery).\nEach signal pin on system side has multiple functions depending on\nwhich operation mode the device is in.The Dual Rail interface consists of TDPn\n1, TDNn, TCLKn, RDPn,\nRDNn and RCLKn. Data transmitt ed from TDPn and TDNn appears on\nTTIPn and TRINGn at the line interface; data received from the RTIPnand RRINGn at the line interface are transferred to RDPn and RDNn\nwhile the recovered clock extracting from the received data stream\noutputs on RCLKn. In Dual Rail operation, the clock/data recovery modeis selectable. Dual Rail interface with clock recovery shown in Figure-4\nis a default configuration mode. Dual Rail interface with data recovery is\nshown in Figure-5 . Pin RDPn and RDNn, are raw RZ slice outputs and\ninternally connected to an EXOR whic h is fed to the RCLKn output for\nexternal clock reco very applications.\nIn Single Rail mode, data transmitted from TDn appears on TTIPn\nand TRINGn at the line interface. Data received from the RTIPn and\nRRINGn at the line interface appears on RDn while the recovered clock\nextracting from the received data stream outputs on RCLKn. When the\ndevice is in single rail interface,  the selectable AMI or HDB3 line\nencoder/decoder is available and any c ode violation in the received data\nwill be indicated at the CVn pin. The Single Rail mode has 2 sub-modes:\nSingle Rail Mode 1 and Single Rail M ode 2. Single Rail Mode 1, whose\ninterface is composed of TDn, TCLKn, RDn, CVn and RCLKn, is real-ized by pulling pin TDNn high fo r more than 16 consecutive TCLK\ncycles. Single Rail Mode 2, whose interface is composed of TDn,\nTCLKn, RDn, CVn, RCLKn and BPVIn, is realized by setting bit CRS in\nregister e-CRS\n2 and bit SING in register e-SING . The difference\nbetween them is that, in the latter mo de bipolar violation can be inserted\nvia pin BPVIn if AMI line code is selected.\nThe configuration of the Hardware  Mode System Interface is summa-\nrized in Table-2 . The configuration of the Host Mode System Interface is\nsummarized in Table-3.\nFigure-4   Dual Rail Interface with Clock Recovery1.

If pin CLKE is\nhigh, the active edge of RCLKn is the rising edge, as for SCLK, that isfalling edge. On the contrary, if CLKE is low, the active edge of RCLK is\nthe falling edge and that of SCLK is  rising edge. Pins RDn/RDPn, CVn/\nRDNn and SDO are always active high, and those output signals are\nclocked out on the active edge of RCLKn and SCLK respectively. See\nTable-4 Active Clock Edge and Active Level on page 14  for details.\nHowever, in dual rail mode without clock recovery, pin CLKE is used toset the active level for RDPn/RDNn  raw slicing output: High for active\nhigh polarity and low for active lo w. It should be noted that data on pin\nSDI are always active high and ar e sampled on the rising edges of\nSCLK. The data on pin TDn/TDPn or BPVIn/TDNn are also always\nactive high but are sampled on the fa lling edges of TCLKn, despite the\nlevel on CLKE.\n2.3 RECEIVER\nIn receive path, the line signals couple into RRINGn and RTIPn via a\ntransformer and are converted into RZ  digital pulses by a data slicer.\nAdaptation for attenuation is achiev ed using an integral peak detector\nthat sets the slicing levels. Cl ock and data are recovered from the\nreceived RZ digital pulses by a di gital phase-locked loop that provides\njitter accommodation. After passing through the selectable jitter attenu-\nator, the recovered data are decoded using HDB3 or AMI line code rulesand clocked out of pin RDn in single rail mode, or presented on RDPn/\nRDNn in an undecoded dual rail NRZ fo rmat. Loss of signal, alarm indi-\ncation signal, line code violation an d excessive zeros are detected.\nThese various changes in status may be enabled to generate interrupts.\n2.3.1 PEAK DETECTOR AND SLICER\nThe slicer determines the pres ence and polarity of the received\npulses. In data recovery mode, the raw positive slicer output appears on\nRDPn while the negative slicer output appears on RDNn. In clock anddata recovery mode, the slicer output is sent to Clock and Data\nRecovery circuit for abstracting re timed data and optional decoding. The\nslicer circuit has a built-in peak detec tor from which the slicing threshold\nis derived. The slicing threshold is  default to 50% (typical) of the peak\nvalue. \nSignals with an attenuation of up to 12 dB (from 2.4 V) can be recov-\nered by the receiver. To provide im munity from impulsive noise, the peak\ndetectors are held above a minimum le vel of 0.150 V typically, despite\nthe received signal level.\n2.3.2 CLOCK AND DATA RECOVERY\nThe Clock and Data Recovery is accomplished by Digital Phase\nLocked Loop (DPLL). The DPLL is clocked 16 times of the received\nclock rate, i.e. 32.768 MHz in E1 mode. The recovered data and clockfrom DPLL is then sent to the selectable Jitter Attenuator or decoder for\nfurther processing.\nThe clock recovery and data recovery mode can be selected on a per\nchannel basis by setting bit CRSn in register e-CRS . When bit CRSn is\ndefaulted to ‘0’, the corresponding channel operates in data and clockrecovery mode. The recovered clock is output on pin RCLKn and re-\ntimed NRZ data are output on pin RD Pn/RDNn in dual rail mode or on\nRDn in single rail mode. When bit CRSn  is set to ‘1’, dual rail mode with\ndata recovery is enabled in the corresponding channel and the clock\nrecovery is bypassed. In this condition, the analog line signals are\nconverted to RZ digital bit str eams on the RDPn/RDNn pins and inter-\nnally connected to an EXOR which is fed to the RCLKn output for\nexternal clock reco very applications.\nIf MCLK is pulled high, all the receivers will enter the dual rail mode\nwith data recovery. In this case, register e-CRS  is ignored.Table-3 System Interface Conf iguration (In Host Mode)\nPin MCLK Pin TDNn CRSn in e-CRS SINGn in e-SING Interface\nClocked High 0 0 Single Rail Mode 1\nClocked Pulse 0 1 Single Rail Mode 2Clocked Pulse 0 0 Dual Rail mode with Clock Recovery\nClocked Pulse 1 0Dual Rail mode with Data Recovery.

HDB3 rules is enabled by\nsetting bit CODE in register GCF  to ‘0’ or pulling pin CODE low. AMI rule\nis enabled by setting bit CODE in register GCF  to ‘1’ or pulling pin CODE\nhigh. The settings affect all eight channels.\nIndividual line code rule select ion for each channel, if needed, is\navailable by setting bit SINGn in register e-SING  to ‘1’ (to activate bit\nCODEn in register e-CODE ) and programming bit CODEn to select line\ncode rules in the corresponding channel: ‘0’ for HDB3, while ‘1’ for AMI.\nIn this case, the value in bit CODE in register GCF  or pin CODE for\nglobal control is unaffected in the corresponding channel and only affect\nin other channels.\nIn dual rail mode, the decoder/enc oder are bypassed. Bit CODE in\nregister GCF, bit CODEn in register e-CODE  and pin CODE are ignored.The configuration of the line code rule is summarized in Table-5 .\n2.3.4 LOSS OF SIGNAL (LOS) DETECTION\nThe Loss of Signal Detector monitors the amplitude and density of\nthe received signal on receiver line before the transformer (measured on\nport A, B shown in Figure-10 ). The loss condition is reported by pulling\npin LOSn high. At the same time, LOS alarm register s track LOS condi-\ntion. When LOS is detected or cleared,  an interrupt will generate if not\nmasked. In host mode, the detection supports ITU G.775 and ETSI 300\n233. In hardware mode, it supports the ITU G.775.\nTable-6  summarizes the conditions of  LOS in clock recovery mode.\nDuring LOS, the RDPn/RDNn continue to output the sliced data\nwhen bit AISE in register GCF  is set to ‘0’ or output all ones as AIS\n(alarm indication signal) when bit AISE is set to ‘1’. The RCLKn isreplaced by MCLK only if the bit AISE is set.\n2.3.5 ALARM INDICATION SIGNAL (AIS) DETECTION\nAlarm Indication Signal is avail able only in host mode with clock\nrecovery, as shown in Table-7 .\n2.3.6 ERROR DETECTION\nThe device can detect excessive ze ros, bipolar violation and HDB3\ncode violation, as shown in Figure-7  and Figure-8 . All the three kinds of\nerrors are reported in both hos t mode and hardware mode with HDB3\nline code rule used. In host mode, the e-CZER  and e-CODV  are used todetermine whether excessive zero s and code violation are reported\nrespectively. When the device is c onfigured in AMI decoding mode, only\nbipolar violation can be reported.\nThe error detection is available onl y in single rail mode in which the\npin CVn/RDNn is used as er ror report output (CVn pin).\nThe configuration and report status  of error detection are summa-\nrized in Table-8 .Table-5 Configuration of the Line Code Rule\nHardware Mode Host Mode\nCODE Line Code Rule CODE in GCF CODEn in e-CODE SINGn in e-SING Line Code Rule\nLow All channels in HDB300 / 1 0All channels in HDB3\n00 1\n10 / 1 0All channels in AMI\nHigh All channels in AMI11 1\n01 1 C H n  i n  A M I1 0 1 CHn in HDB3\nTable-6 LOS Condition in Clock Recovery Mode\nStandard Signal on \nLOSnG.775 ETSI 300 233\nLOS \nDetectedContinuous Intervals 32 2048 (1 ms)High\nAmplitude(1)\n1.

The data are sampled into thedevice on falling edges of TCLKn. Jitter attenuator, if enabled, isprovided with a FIFO through whic h the data to be transmitted are\npassing. A low jitter clock is generated by an integral digital phase-locked loop and is used to read data from the FIFO. The shape of the\npulses should meet the E1 pulse template after the signal passes\nthrough different cable lengths or ty pes. Bipolar violation, for diagnosis,\ncan be inserted on pin BPVIn if AMI line code rule is enabled.Table-8 Error Detection\nHardware Mode Host Mode\nLine Code Pin CVn Reports Line Code CODVn in e-CODV CZERn in e-CZER Pin CVn Reports\nAMI Bipolar Violation AMI - - Bipolar Violation\nHDB3Bipolar Violation + \nCode Violation\n+ Excessive ZerosHDB30 0 Bipolar Violation + Code Violation\n0 1 Bipolar Violation + Code Violation + Excessive Zeros1 0 Bipolar Violation1 1 Bipolar Violation + Excessive Zeros\nBipolar Violation detected Bipolar ViolationRCLKn\nRTIPn\nRRINGn\nRDn\nCVn1\n23\n45V\n67\n12 3 45 6 V\nCode violation detected Excessive zeros detectedRCLKn\nRTIPn\nRRINGn\nRDn\nCVnCode violation\n4 consecutive zeros1\n23\n4VV5\n6\n12 3 4 5 6\n\n17IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\n2.4.1 WAVEFORM SHAPER\nE1 pulse template, specified in ITU-T G.703, is shown in Figure-9 .\nThe device has built-in transmit wave form templates for cable of 75 Ω or\n120 Ω.\nThe built-in waveform shaper uses  an internal high frequency clock\nwhich is 16XMCLK as the clock re ference. This function will be\nbypassed when MCLK is unavailable.\nFigure-9   CEPT Waveform Template\n2.4.2 BIPOLAR VIOLATION INSERTION\nWhen configured in Single Rail Mode 2 with AMI line code enabled,\npin TDNn/BPVIn is used as BPVI input. A low-to-high transition on this\npin inserts a bipolar violation on the next available mark in the transmit\ndata stream. Sampling occurs on the falling edges of TCLK. But in TAOS\n(Transmit All Ones) with Analog Loopback and Remote Loopback, the\nBPVI is disabled. In TAOS with Digital Loopback, the BPVI is loopedback to the system side, so the data to be transmitted on TTIPn and\nTRINGn are all ones with  no bipolar violation.\n2.5  JITTER ATTENUATOR\nThe jitter attenuator can be selected to work either in transmit path or\nin receive path or not used. The sele ction is accomplished by setting pin\nJAS in hardware mode or configur ing bits JACF[1:0] in register GCF  in\nhost mode, which affects all eight channels.For applications which require line  synchronization, the line clock\nneeded to be extracted for the internal  synchronization, the jitter attenu-\nator is set in the receive path. Another use of the jitter attenuator is to\nprovide clock smoothing in the trans mit path for applications such as\nsynchronous/asynchronous demultiplex ing applications. In these appli-\ncations, TCLK will have an instantaneous frequency that is higher than\nthe nominal E1 data rate and in order  to set the average long-term TCLK\nfrequency within the transmit line rate  specifications, periods of TCLK\nare suppressed (gapped).\nThe jitter attenuator integrates a FIFO which can accommodate a\ngapped TCLK. In host mode, the FIFO length can be 32 X 2 or 64 X 2\nbits by programming bit JADP in GCF. In hardware mode, it is fixed to 64\nX 2 bits. The FIFO length determi nes the maximum permissible gap\nwidth (see Table-9 Gap Width Limitation ). Exceeding these values will\ncause FIFO overflow or underflow . The data is 16 or 32 bits’ delay\nthrough the jitter attenuator in the corresponding transmit or receive\npath. The constant delay feature is crucial for the applications requiring\n“hitless” switching.\nIn host mode, bit JABW in GCF determines the jitter attenuator 3 dB\ncorner frequency (fc). In hardware mode, the fc is fixed to 1.7 Hz. Gener-\nally, the lower the fc is, the higher the attenuation. However, lower fc\ncomes at the expense of increased acquisition time. Therefore, theoptimum fc is to optimize both t he attenuation and the acquisition time.\nIn addition, the longer FIFO length results in an increased throughput\ndelay and also influences the 3 dB corner frequency. Generally, it’s\nrecommended to use the lower corner frequency and the shortest FIFO\nlength that can still meet jitter attenuation requirements.\nThe output jitter meets ITU-T G.736, ITU-T G.742, ITU-T G.783 and\nETSI CTR 12/13.\n2.6 LINE INTERFACE CIRCUITRY\nThe transmit and receive interf ace RTIPn/RRINGn and TTIPn/\nTRINGn connections provide a ma tched interface to the cable.

When the\nshort circuit protection is enabled, the driver output current is limited to a\ntypical value: 180 mAp. Also, register DF, DFI and DFM  will be available.\nWhen DFMON will detect a short circuit, register DF will be set. With a\nshort circuit failure detected and shor t circuit protection enabled, register\nDFI will be set and an interrupt will be generated on pin INT.2.9 TRANSMIT LINE SIDE SHORT CIRCUIT FAILURE \nDETECTION\nA pair of 9.5 Ω serial resistors connect with TTIPn and TRINGn pins\nand limit the output current.

In receive side, the\nseries resistors of 1 k Ω are used to protect the receiver against current\nsurges coupled in the device. The series resistors do not affect the\nreceiver sensitivity, since the re ceiver impedance is as high as 120 k Ω\ntypically.\n2.11 HITLESS PROTECTION SWITCHING (HPS)\nThe IDT82V2058 transceivers incl ude an output driver with high-Z\nfeature for E1 redundancy applications. This feature reduces the cost of\nredundancy protection by eliminating exte rnal relays. Details of HPS are\ndescribed in relative Application Note.\n2.12 SOFTWARE RESET\nWriting register RS will cause software reset by initiating about 1 µs\nreset cycle. This operation set all the registers to their default value.\n2.13 POWER ON RESET\nDuring power up, an internal rese t signal sets all the registers to\ndefault values. The power-on reset takes at least 10 µs, starting from\nwhen the power supply exceeds 2/3 VDDA.\n2.14 POWER DOWN\nEach transmit channel will be powered down by pulling pin TCLKn\nlow for more than 64 MCLK cycles (i f MCLK is available) or about 30 µs\n(if MCLK is not available). In hos t mode, each transmit channel will also\nbe powered down by setting bit TPDNn in register e-TPDN  to ‘1’.\nAll the receivers will be power ed down when MCLK is low. When\nMCLK is clocked or high, se tting bit RPDNn in register e-RPDN  to ‘1’ will\nconfigure the corresponding receiver to be powered down.\n2.15 INTERFACE WITH 5 V LOGIC\nThe IDT82V2058 can interface directly  with 5 V TTL family devices.\nThe internal input pads are tolerant to 5 V output from TTL and CMOS\nfamily devices.\n2.16 LOOPBACK MODE\nThe device provides four differ ent diagnostic loopback configura-\ntions: Digital Loopback, Analog Loopback, Remote Loopback and Dual\nLoopback. In host mode, these functi ons are implemented by program-\nming the registers DLB, ALB and RLB respectively. In hardware mode,\nonly Analog Loopback and Remote Loopback can be selected by pin\nLPn.\n2.16.1 DIGITAL LOOPBACK\nBy programming the bits of register DLB, each channel of the device\ncan be configured in Local Digital Loopb ack. In this configuration, the\ndata and clock to be transmitted, after passing the encoder, are looped\nback to Jitter Attenuator (if enabled) and decoder in the receive path,then output on RCLKn, RDn/RDPn and CVn/RDNn. The data to be\ntransmitted are still output on TTIPn and TRINGn while the data\nreceived on RTIPn and RRINGn are ignored. The Loss Detector is still inuse. Figure-11  shows the process.During Digital Loopback, the received signal on the receive line is still\nmonitored by the LOS Detector (See 2.3.4 Loss of Signal (LOS) Detec-\ntion for details). In case of a LOS condition and AIS insertion enabled, all\nones signal will be output on RDPn/RDNn. With ATAO enabled, all onessignal will be also output on TTIPn/TRINGn. AIS insertion can be\nenabled by setting AISE bit  in register GCF and ATAO can be enabled\nby setting register ATAO  (default disabled).\n2.16.2 ANALOG LOOPBACK\nBy programming the bits of register ALB or pulling pin LPn high,\neach channel of the device can be configured in Analog Loopback. In\nthis configuration, the data to be transmitted output from the line driver\nare internally looped back to the slicer and peak detector in the receivepath and output on RCLKn, RDn/RDPn and CVn/RDNn. The data to be\ntransmitted are still output on TTIPn and TRINGn while the data\nreceived on RTIPn and RRINGn are ignored. The LOS Detector (See2.3.4 Loss of Signal (LOS) Detection  for details) is still in use and moni-\ntors the internal looped back data. If a LOS condition on TDPn/TDNn is\nexpected during Analog Loopback, AT AO should be disabled (default).\nFigure-12  shows the process.\nThe TTIPn and RTIPn, TRINGn and RRINGn cannot be connected\ndirectly to do the external anal og loopback test. Line impedance loading\nis required to conduct the external analog loopback test.\n2.16.3 REMOTE LOOPBACK\nBy programming the bits of register RLB or pulling pin LPn low, each\nchannel of the device can be set in Remote Loopback. In this configura-tion, the data and clock recovered by the clock and data recovery\ncircuits are looped to waveform shaper and output on TTIPn and\nTRINGn. The jitter attenuator is also included in loopback when enabled\nin the transmit or receive path. The received data and clock are still\noutput on RCLKn, RDn/RDPn and CVn/RDNn while the data to be trans-\nmitted on TCLKn, TDn/TDPn and BPV In/TDNn are ignored. The LOs\nDetector is still in use. Figure-13  shows the process. \n2.16.4 DUAL LOOPBACK\nDual Loopback mode is set by setting bit DLBn in register DLB and\nbit RLBn in register RLB to ‘1’. In this configuration, after passing the\nencoder, the data and clock to be transmitted are looped back to\ndecoder directly and output on RCLKn, RDn/RDPn and CVn/RDNn. The\nrecovered data from RTIPn and RRINGn are looped back to waveformshaper through JA (if selected) and output on TTIPn and TRINGn. The\nLOS Detector is still in use. Figure-14  shows the process.\n2.16.5 TRANSMIT ALL ONES (TAOS)\nIn hardware mode, the TAOS mode is set by pulling pin TCLKn high\nfor more than 16 MCLK cycles. In host mode, TAOS mode is set byprogramming register TAO. In addition, automatic TAOS signals are\ninserted by setting register ATAO  when Loss of Signal occurs. Note that\nthe TAOS generator adopts MCLK as a timing reference. In order to\nassure that the output frequency is within specified limits, MCLK must\nhave the applicable stability.\nThe TAOS mode, the TAOS mode with Digital Loopback and the\nTAOS mode with Analog Loopback are shown in Figure-15 , Figure-16\nand Figure-17 .\n\n20IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\nFigure-11   Digital Loopback\nFigure-12   Analog Loopback\nFigure-13   Remote LoopbackJitter\nAttenuatorJitter\nAttenuatorHDB3/AMI\nDecoder\nHDB3/AMI\nEncoderSlicer\nPeak\nDetectorCLK&Data\nRecovery\n(DPLL)\nLine\nDriverWaveform\nShaperLOS\nDetector\nDigital\nLoopbackOne of Eight Identical Channels\nRTIPn\nRRINGn\nTTIPn\nTRINGnLOSn\nRCLKn\nRDn/RDPn\nCVn/RDNn\nTCLKn\nBPVIn/TDNnTDn/TDPn\nTransmit\nAll Ones\nJitter\nAttenuatorJitter\nAttenuatorHDB3/AMI\nDecoder\nHDB3/AMI\nEncoderAnalog\nLoopbackSlicer\nPeak\nDetectorCLK&Data\nRecovery\n(DPLL)\nLine\nDriverWaveform\nShaperLOS\nDetectorOne of Eight Identical Channels\nRTIPn\nRRINGn\nTTIPn\nTRINGnLOSn\nRCLKn\nRDn/RDPn\nCVn/RDNn\nTCLKn\nBPVIn/TDNnTDn/TDPn\nTransmit\nAll Ones\nJitter\nAttenuatorJitter\nAttenuatorHDB3/AMI\nDecoder\nHDB3/AMI\nEncoderRemote\nLoopbackSlicer\nPeak\nDetectorCLK&Data\nRecovery\n(DPLL)\nLine\nDriverWaveform\nShaperLOS\nDetectorOne of Eight Identical Channels\nRTIPn\nRRINGn\nTTIPn\nTRINGnLOSn\nRCLKn\nRDn/RDPn\nCVn/RDNn\nTCLKn\nBPVIn/TDNnTDn/TDPn\nTransmit\nAll Ones\n\n21IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\nFigure-14   Dual Loopback\nFigure-15   TAOS Data Path\nFigure-16   TAOS with Digital LoopbackJitter\nAttenuatorJitter\nAttenuatorHDB3/AMI\nDecoder\nHDB3/AMI\nEncoderSlicer\nPeak\nDetectorCLK&Data\nRecovery\n(DPLL)\nLine\nDriverWaveform\nShaperLOS\nDetectorOne of Eight Identical Channels\nRTIPn\nRRINGn\nTTIPn\nTRINGnLOSn\nRCLKn\nRDn/RDPnCVn/RDNn\nTCLKn\nBPVIn/TDNnTDn/TDPn\nTransmit\nAll Ones\nJitter\nAttenuatorJitter\nAttenuatorHDB3/AMI\nDecoder\nHDB3/AMI\nEncoderSlicer\nPeak\nDetectorCLK&Data\nRecovery\n(DPLL)\nLine\nDriverWaveform\nShaperLOS\nDetectorOne of Eight Identical Channels\nRTIPn\nRRINGn\nTTIPn\nTRINGnLOSn\nRCLKn\nRDn/RDPn\nCVn/RDNn\nTCLKn\nBPVIn/TDNnTDn/TDPn\nTransmit\nAll Ones\nJitter\nAttenuatorJitter\nAttenuatorHDB3/AMI\nDecoder\nHDB3/AMI\nEncoderSlicer\nPeak\nDetectorCLK&Data\nRecovery\n(DPLL)\nLine\nDriverWaveform\nShaperLOS\nDetectorOne of Eight Identical Channels\nRTIPn\nRRINGn\nTTIPn\nTRINGnLOSn\nRCLKn\nRDn/RDPnCVn/RDNn\nTCLKn\nBPVIn/TDNnTDn/TDPn\nTransmit\nAll Ones\n\n22IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\nFigure-17   TAOS with Analog Loopback\n2.17 HOST INTERFACE\nThe host interface provides access  to read and write the registers in\nthe device. The interface consists of serial host interface and parallel\nhost interface. By pulling pin MODE2 to  VDDIO/2 or high, the device can\nbe set to work in serial mode and in parallel mode respectively.2.17.1 PARALLEL HOST INTERFACE \nThe interface is compatible with Motorola and Intel host. Pins\nMODE1 and MODE0 are used to select the operating mode of the\nparallel host interface. When pin MODE1 is pulled low, the host uses\nseparate address bus and data bus. When high, multiplexed address/data bus is used. When pin MODE0 is pulled low, the parallel host inter-\nface is configured for Motorola compatible hosts. When pin MODE0 is\npulled high, the parallel host interface is configured for Intel compatiblehosts. See Table-1 Pin Description  for more details. The host interface\npins in each operation mode is tabulated in Table-12 :\nFigure-18   Serial Host Mode Timing\n2.17.2 SERIAL HOST INTERFACE \nBy pulling pin MODE2 to VDDIO/2, the device operates in the serial\nhost Mode. In this mode, the regist ers are accessible through a 16-bit\nword which contains an 8-bit command/address byte (bit R/ W and 5-\naddress-bit A1~A5, A6 and A7 bits  are ignored) and a subsequent 8-bitdata byte (D7~D0), as shown in Figure-18 . When bit R/ W is set to ‘1’,\ndata is read out from pin SDO. When bit R/ W is set to ‘0’, data on pin\nSDI is written into the register w hose address is indicated by address\nbits A5~A1.

Status change in register LOS. The analog/digital loss of signal \ndetector continuously monitors the received signal to update the \nspecific bit in register LOS which indicates presence or absence \nof a LOS condition.\n2. Status change in register DF. The automatic power driver circuit \ncontinuously monitors the output drivers signal to update the \nspecific bit in register DFM  which indicates presence or absence \nof an output driver short circuit condition.\n3. Status change in register AIS. The AIS detector monitors the \nreceived signal to update the specific bit in register AIS which \nindicates presence or absence of a AIS condition.\nFigure-19   Interru pt Service Routine2.18.2 INTERRUPT ENABLE\nThe IDT82V2058 provides a latched interrupt output ( INT) and the\nfour kinds of interrupts are all repor ted by this pin. When the Interrupt\nMask register ( LOSM , DFM  and AISM ) is set to ‘1’, the Interrupt Status\nregister ( LOSI , DFI and AISI) is enabled respectively. Whenever there is\na transition (‘0’ to ‘1’ or ‘1’ to ‘0’)  in the corresponding status register, the\nInterrupt Status register will change into ‘1’, which means an interrupt\noccurs, and there will be a high to low transition on INT pin. An external\npull-up resistor of approximately 10 k Ω is required to support the wire-\nOR operation of INT. When any of the three Interrupt Mask registers is\nset to ‘0’ (the power-on default value is ‘0’), the corresponding Interrupt\nStatus register is disabled and t he transition on status register is\nignored.\n2.18.3 INTERRUPT CLEARING\nWhen an interrupt occurs, the Interrupt Status registers: LOSI , DFI\nand AISI, are read to identify the interrup t source. These registers will be\ncleared to ‘0’ after the corr esponding status registers: LOS, DF and AIS\nare read. The Status registers will be cleared once the corresponding\nconditions are met.\nPin INT is pulled high when there is no pending interrupt left. The\ninterrupt handling in the interrupt service routine is showed in Figure-19 .\n2.19 G.772 MONITORING\nThe eight channels of IDT82V2058 can all be configured to work as\nregular transceivers. In applicati ons using only seven channels (chan-\nnels 1 to 7), channel 0 is configured to  non-intrusively monitor any of the\nother channels’ inputs or outputs on t he line side. The monitoring is non-\nintrusive per ITU-T G.772. Figure-20  shows the Monitoring Principle.\nThe receiver path or transmitter path to be monitored is configured by\npins MC[3:0] in hardwar e mode or by register PMON  in host mode.\nThe monitored signal goes thr ough the clock and data recovery\ncircuit of channel 0. The monitor ed clock can output on RCLK0 which\ncan be used as a timing interfaces derived from E1 signal. The moni-\ntored data can be observed digitally at the output pins RCLK0, RD0/\nRDP0 and RDN0. LOS detector is still in use in channel 0 for the moni-\ntored signal. \nIn monitoring mode, channel 0 c an be configured in Remote Loop-\nback. The signal which is being monitored will output on TTIP0 and\nTRING0. The output signal can then be connected to a standard test\nequipment with an E1 electrical in terface for non-intrusive monitoring.\nService the InterruptRead Interrupt Status Register\nRead Corresponding Status\nRegisterInterrupt Allowed\nInterrupt Condition\n Exist?\nYesNo\n\n24IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\nFigure-20   Monitoring PrincipleJitter\nAttenuatorJitter\nAttenuatorHDB3/\nAMI\nDecoder\nHDB3/\nAMI\nEncoderSlicer\nPeak\nDetectorCLK&Data\nRecovery\n(DPLL)\nLine\nDriverWaveform\nShaperLOS\nDetectorChannel N ( 7 > N > 1 )\nRTIPn\nRRINGn\nTTIPn\nTRINGnLOSn\nRCLKn\nRDn/RDPn\nCVn/RDNn\nTCLKn\nBPVIn/TDNnTDn/TDPn\nG.772\nMonitorTransmit\nAll Ones\nJitter\nAttenuatorJitter\nAttenuatorHDB3/\nAMI\nDecoder\nHDB3/\nAMI\nEncoderRemote\nLoopbackSlicer\nPeak\nDetectorCLK&Data\nRecovery\n(DPLL)\nLine\nDriverWaveform\nShaperLOS\nDetectorChannel 0\nLOS0\nRCLK0\nRD0/RDP0\nCV0/RDN0\nTCLK0\nBPVI0/TDN0TD0/TDP0\nTransmit\nAll OnesRTIP0\nRRING0\nTTIP0\nTRING0\n\n25IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\n3 PROGRAMMING INFORMATION\n3.1 REGISTER LIST AND MAP\nThere are 21 primary registers (inc luding an Address Pointer Control\nRegister and 8 expanded registers in the device).\nWhatever the control interface is, 5 address bits are used to set the\nregisters. In non-multiplexed paralle l interface mode, the five dedicated\naddress bits are A[4:0]. In multiplexed parallel interface mode, AD[4:0]carries the address information. In se rial interface mode, A[5:1] are used\nto address the register.The Register ADDP , addressed as 11111 or 1F Hex, switches\nbetween primary registers bank  and expanded registers bank.\nBy setting the register ADDP  to ‘AAH’, the 5 address bits point to the\nexpanded register bank, that is, the expanded registers ar e available. By\nclearing register ADDP , the primary registers are available.\nPrimary Registers, whose addresses are 10H, 11H, 16H to 1EH, are\nreserved.

Control of the TAP is\nachieved through signals applied to the TMS and TCK pins. Data is\nshifted into the registers via the TDI pin, and shifted out of the registers\nvia the TDO pin. JTAG test data are clocked at a rate determined byJTAG test clock.The JTAG boundary scan registers includes BSR (Boundary Scan\nRegister), IDR (Device Identification Register),  BR (Bypass Register)\nand IR (Instruction Register). These will be described in the following\npages. Refer to Figure-21  for architecture.\n4.1 JTAG INSTRUCTIONS AND INSTRUCTION REG-\nISTER (IR)\nThe IR with instruction decode block is used to select the test to be\nexecuted or the data register to be accessed or both.\nThe instructions are shifted in LSB first to this 3-bit register. See\nTable-17 Instruction Register Description on page 34  for details of the\ncodes and the instructions related.\nFigure-21   JTAG ArchitectureBSR (Boundary Scan Register)\nIDR (Device Identification Register)\nBR (Bypass Register)\nIR (Instruction Register)MUX\nTDOTDI\nTCKTMS\nTRSTControl<6:0>\nMUX\nSelect\nHigh-Z EnableTAP\n(Test Access Port)\nControllerparallel latched outputDigital output pins Digital input pins\n\n34IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\n4.2 JTAG DATA REGISTER\n4.2.1 DEVICE IDENTIFICATION REGISTER (IDR)\nThe IDR can be set to define the producer number, part number and\nthe device revision, which can be us ed to verify the proper version or\nrevision number that has been used in  the system under test. The IDR is\n32 bits long and is partitioned as in Table-18 . Data from the IDR is\nshifted out to TDO LSB first.4.2.2 BYPASS REGISTER (BR)\nThe BR consists of a single bit. It can provide a serial path between\nthe TDI input and TDO output, bypassi ng the BSR to reduce test access\ntimes.\n4.2.3 BOUNDARY SCAN REGISTER (BSR)\nThe BSR can apply and read test patterns in parallel to or from all the\ndigital I/O pins. The BSR is a 98 bits long shift register and is initialized\nand read using the instruction EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. Each\npin is related to one or more bits in the BSR. Please refer to Table-19  for\ndetails of BSR bits and their functions.Table-17 Instruction Register Description\nIR Code Instruction Comments\n000 ExtestThe external test instruction allows testing of the interconnection to other devices. When the current instruction is the \nEXTEST instruction, the boundary scan register is placed between TDI and TDO. The signal on the input pins can be \nsampled by loading the boundary scan register using the Captur e-DR state. The sampled values can then be viewed by \nshifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR state. The signal on the output pins can be controlled by loading \npatterns shifted in through input TDI into the boundary scan register using the Update-DR state.\n100 Sample/PreloadThe sample instruction samples all the device inputs and outputs. For this instruction, the boundary scan register is placed \nbetween TDI and TDO. The normal path between IDT82V2058  logic and the I/O pins is maintained. Primary device \ninputs and outputs can be sampled by loading the boundary scan register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled val-ues can then be viewed by shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR state. \n110 IdcodeThe identification instruction is used to connect the identification register between TDI and TDO. The device's identifica-\ntion code can then be shifted out using the Shift-DR state.\n111 BypassThe bypass instruction shifts data from input TDI to output TDO with one TCK clock period delay.

Figure-\n22 shows its state diagram A descripti on of each state follows. Note that\nthe figure contains two main branc hes to access either the data orinstruction registers. The value s hown next to each state transition in\nthis figure states the value present  at TMS at each rising edge of TCK.\nRefer to Table-20  for details of the state description.\nTable-20 TAP Controller State Description\nState Description\nTest Logic ResetIn this state, the test logic is disabled. The device is set to normal operation. During initialization, the device initializes  the instruction register \nwith the IDCODE instruction.\nRegardless of the original state of the controller, the controlle r enters the Test-Logic-Reset state when the TMS input is held  high for at least 5 \nrising edges of TCK. The controller remains in this state while TMS is high. The device processor automatically enters this sta te at power-up.\nRun-Test/IdleThis is a controller state between scan operations. Once in this state, the controller remains in the state as long as TMS is h eld low. The \ninstruction register and all test data registers retain their previous state. When TMS is high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller \nmoves to the Select-DR state.\nSelect-DR-ScanThis is a temporary controller state and the instruction does not change in this state. The test data register selected by the current instruction \nretains its previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves int o the Capture-DR \nstate and a scan sequence for the selected test data register is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge applied to TC K, the controller \nmoves to the Select-IR-Scan state.\nCapture-DRIn this state, the Boundary Scan Register captures input pin data if the current instruction is EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. The i nstruction \ndoes not change in this state. The other test data registers, which do not have parallel input, are not changed. When the TAP c ontroller is in \nthis state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or the Shift-DR state i f TMS is low.\nShift-DRIn this controller state, the test data register connected between TDI and TDO as a result of the current instruction shifts da ta on stage toward \nits serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The instruction does not change in this state. When the TAP controller is in this  state and a rising \nedge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or remains in the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.\nExit1-DRThis is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to ente r the Update-DR \nstate, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the  Pause-DR \nstate. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not chang e during this state.\nPause-DRThe pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the test data register in the seria l path between TDI \nand TDO. For example, this state could be used to allow the tester to reload its pin memory from disk during application of a l ong test \nsequence. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not ch ange during this \nstate. The controller remains in this state as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller \nmoves to the Exit2-DR state.\nExit2-DRThis is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to ente r the Update-DR \nstate, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the  Shift-DR state. \nThe test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change durin g this state.\nUpdate-DRThe Boundary Scan Register is provided with a latched parallel output to prevent changes while data is shifted in response to t he EXTEST \nand SAMPLE/PRELOAD instructions. When the TAP controller is in this state and the Boundary Scan Register is selected, data is l atched into \nthe parallel output of this register from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. The data held at the latched para llel output changes \nonly in this state. All shift-register stages in the test data register selected by the current instruction retain their previo us value and the instruc-\ntion does not change during this state.\nSelect-IR-ScanThis is a temporary controller state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous state. If  TMS is held low and \na rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the contro ller moves into the Capture-IR state, and a scan sequence for the  instruction reg-\nister is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Test-Logic-Reset state . The instruction \ndoes not change during this state. \nCapture-IRIn this controller state, the shift register contained in the instruction register loads a fixed value of ‘100’ on the rising e dge of TCK. This sup-\nports fault-isolation of the board-level serial test data path. Data registers selected by the current instruction retain their  value and the instruc-\ntion does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controlle r enters the Exit1-\nIR state if TMS is held high, or the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.\nShift-IRIn this state, the shift register contained in the instruction register is connected between TDI and TDO and shifts data one st age towards its \nserial output on each rising edge of TCK. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value  and the instruction \ndoes not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller ent ers the Exit1-IR \nstate if TMS is held high, or remains in the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.\n\n38IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\nFigure-22   JTAG State DiagramExit1-IRThis is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to ente r the Update-IR \nstate, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the  Pause-IR state. \nThe test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change durin g this state.\nPause-IRThe pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the instruction register. The test data register selected \nby the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller rem ains in this state as \nlong as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-IR state.\nExit2-IRThis is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to ente r the Update-IR \nstate, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the  Shift-IR state. \nThe test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change durin g this state.\nUpdate-IRThe instruction shifted into the instruction register is latched into the parallel output from the shift-register path on the f alling edge of TCK. \nWhen the new instruction has been latched, it becomes the current  instruction. The test data registers selected by the current instruction \nretain their previous value.Table-20 TAP Controller Stat e Description (Continued)\nState Description\nTest-logic Reset\nRun Test/Idle Select-DR Select-IR\nCapture-DR Capture-IR\nShift-DR Shift-IR\nExit1-DR Exit1-IR\nPause-DR Pause-IR\nExit2-DR Exit2-IR\nUpdate-DR Update-IR1\n00\n1 1 1\n00\n00\n0 0\n1 11\n01\n0\n1\n1\n1 0 1 01\n0\n1\n10 0\n01\n\n39IDT82V2058 OCTAL E1 SHORT HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT INDUSTRIAL TEMPERATURE RANGES\nABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATING\nRECOMMENDED OPERATING CONDITIONSSymbol Parameter Min Max Unit\nVDDA, VDDD Core Power Supply -0.5 4.0 V\nVDDIO0, VDDIO1 I/O Power Supply -0.5 4.0 V\nVDDT0-7 Transmit Power Supply -0.5 7.0 V\nVinInput Voltage, any digital pin GND-0.5 5.5 V\nInput Voltage(1), RTIPn pins and RRINGn pins\n1.
