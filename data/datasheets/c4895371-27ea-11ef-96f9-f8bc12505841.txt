[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a technical specialist with expertise in electronics. Your task is to analyze datasheets for electronic components and provide a concise summary of the product’s key characteristics and specifications. In addition, you need to gather textual information about the component, including its description and typical applications.Instructions:    Identify the correct component in the datasheet using the provided product code.    Summarize key parameters, including:        Voltage ratings        Current ratings        Power consumption        Operating temperature range        Package type        Special features or notes (if applicable)        Moisture Sensetive Level JEDEC J-STD-020E    Provide a short description of the component, including what it is (e.g., transistor, microcontroller, sensor) and its primary function.    Explain typical applications for the component (e.g., power management, signal processing, data storage, etc.).    Be thorough and accurate: Ensure the information corresponds specifically to the product code, as some datasheets cover multiple variants.Your goal is to create a clear and accurate technical summary that includes both key specifications and a description of what the component is used for.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Give me information about the component of MFR25FTE52-56K production of YAGEO from the text:  \nProduct specification – September 27, 2023  V.3 \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDATA SHEET\n METAL  FILM RESISTORS  \nGeneral Purpose  \nMFR Series  \n±0.5%,  ±1%,  ±2%,  ±5%   \n1/6W to 3W  \nRoHS compliant  & Halogen  Free  \n \n \n \n\nwww.yageo.com  \n Sep. 27, 2023   V.3  \n \n \n \n Metal Film Resistors  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  2 \n17 \n Product Specification  \n \n MFR \n \n Through Hole Resistor s \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAPPLICATIONS  \n\uf09f All general purpose \napplications  \n\uf09f Power applications  \n \n \n \nEATURES  \n\uf09f AEC-Q200 qualified  \n\uf09f Wide resistance range  \n\uf09f PPAP ready \n(MFR -25/MFR50S/MFR -50) \n\uf09f High stability  \n\uf09f RoHS compliant & \nhalogen -free \n  \nORDERING  INFORMATION  \nPart number of the general purpose  metal film resistor  are identified by \nthe series, power  rating , tolerance, packing , temperature coefficient, \nforming  and resistance value.  \n \nPART NUMBER  \n \nMFR     200    F    T     F    73-    100R   \n(1)       (2)     (3)    (4)     (5)    (6)      (7) \n(1) SERIES  \nMFR S eries  \n \n(2) POWER RATING  \n-12 = 1/6W  \n25S = 1/4W \n-25 = 1/4W \n50S = 1/2W \n -50 = 1/2W \n100 = 1W \n2WS  = 2W 200 = 2W \n3WS  = 3W \n1WS  = 1W \n(3) TOLERANCE  \nD = ±0. 5% \nJ = ±5% \n F = ±1% G = ±2% \n(4) PACKAGING  \nR = Reel Pack   T = Box Pack  B = Bulk  \n(5) TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF RESISTANCE  \nE=±50ppm/ °C \n F=±100ppm/ °C \n -
