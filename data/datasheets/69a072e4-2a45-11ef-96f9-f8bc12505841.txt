All channels exhibit break-before-make switch-ing action preventing momentary shorting when switching\nchannels. An EN  input on the ADG786 is used to enable or\ndisable the device. When disabled, all channels are switched OFF.\nThese multiplexers are designed on an enhanced submicron\nprocess that provides low power dissipation yet gives high switch-\ning speed, very low on resistance, high signal bandwidths and\nlow leakage currents. On resistance is in the region of a fewohms, is closely matched between switches and very flat over\nthe full signal range. These parts can operate equally well in\neither direction and have an input signal range which extends tothe supplies.\nThe ADG786 and ADG788 are available in small 20-lead\nchip scale packages.PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1. Small 20-Lead 4 mm × 4 mm Chip Scale Packages (CSP).\n2. Single/Dual Supply Operation. The ADG786 and ADG788\nare fully specified and guaranteed with 3 V ± 10% and\n5 V ± 10% single supply rails, and ±2.5 V ± 10% dual\nsupply rails.\n3. Low On Resistance (2.5 Ω typical).\n4. Low Power Consumption (<0.01 μW).\n5. Guaranteed Break-Before-Make Switching Action.FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAMS\nS1B\nD1\nS1A\nA0S2A\nD2\nS2BS3BD3S3A\nA1ADG786\nSWITCHES SHOWN FOR A LOGIC “1” INPUT S1A\nD1\nS1B\nIN1\nIN2\nS2B\nD2\nS2A S3AD3S3BIN3IN4S4BD\x17S4A\nADG788\nEN A2LOGICFEATURES \n1.8 V to 5.5 V Single Supply \n±2.5 V Dual Supply \n2.5ȍOn Resistance \n0.5ȍOn Resistance Flatness \n100 pA Leakage Currents 19 ns Switching Times \nTriple SPDT: ADG786 \nQuad SPDT: ADG788 \n20-Lead 4 mm ×4 mm Chip Scale Packages \nLow Power Consumption TTL/CMOS-Compatible Inputs \nFor Functionally-Equivalent Devices in 16-Lead TSSOP \n   Packages, See ADG733/ADG734 \nQualified for automotive applications \nAPPLICATIONS \nData Acquisition Systems \nCommunication Systems \nRelay Replacement \nAudio and Video Switching \nBattery-Powered Systems\n \nRev.

Channel-to-Channel CrosstalkPower Supply Sequencing\nWhen using CMOS devices, care must be taken to ensure cor-\nrect power supply sequencing. Incorrect sequencing can result\nin the device being subjected to stresses beyond those maximum\nratings listed in the data sheet. Digital and analog inputs shouldbe applied to the device after supplies and ground. In dual sup-\nply applications, if digital and analog inputs may be applied\nprior to V\nDD and V SS supplies, the addition of a Schottky diode\nconnected between V SS and GND will ensure that the device\npowers on correctly. For single supply applications, V SS should\nbe tied to GND as close to the device as possible.VS\nVOUT50/H9024NETWORK\nANALYZER\nRL\n50/H9024IN\nGNDVINS\nD\nINSERTION LOSS = 20 LOGVOUTWITH SWITCH\nVOUTWITHOUT SWITCHVDD0.1/H9262FVDD\nVSS0.1/H9262FVSS\nTest Circuit 10.
