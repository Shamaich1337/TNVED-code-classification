Unlike conventional PWM (pulse width modulator) controllers, LinkSwitch-XT2 ICs use  a simple ON/OFF control to regulate the output voltage.  The LinkSwitch-XT2 controller consists of an oscillator, feedback (sense and logic) circuit, 5.0 V regulator, BYPASS pin undervoltage circuit, over-temperature protection, line and output overvoltage protection, frequency jittering, current limit circuit, leading edge blanking and a high-voltage power MOSFET.  The LinkSwitch-XT2 incorporates additional circuitry for auto-restart.\nOscillator\nThe typical oscillator frequency is internally set to an average of  \nf\nOSC (66 kHz or 132 kHz).  Two signals are generated from the \noscillator: the maximum duty cycle signal (DCMAX) and the clock signal \nthat indicates the beginning of each cycle.\nThe LinkSwitch-XT2 oscillator incorporates circuitry that introduces a\nsmall amount of frequency jitter, typically 4 kHz peak-to-peak (LNK369X) \nand 8 kHz peak-to-peak (LNK3604), to minimize EMI emission.  The modulation rate of the frequency jitter is set to 1 kHz to optimize EMI reduction for both average and quasi-peak emissions.  The frequency jitter should be measured with the oscilloscope triggered at the falling edge of the DRAIN waveform.  The waveform in Figure 5 illustrates the frequency jitter of the LinkSwitch-XT2 IC.\nFeedback Input Circuit\nThe feedback input circuit at the FEEDBACK pin consists of a low\nimpedance source follower output set at V\nFB (2.0 V).  When the\ncurrent delivered into this pin exceeds IFB (49 µA ), a low logic level\n(disable) is generated at the output of the feedback circuit.  Thisoutput is sampled at the beginning of each cycle on the rising edge ofthe clock signal.  If high, the power MOSFET is turned on for thatcycle (enabled), otherwise the power MOSFET remains off (disabled).The sampling is done only at the beginning of each cycle.  Subse-\nquent changes in the FEEDBACK pin voltage or current during the\nremainder of the cycle do not impact the MOSFET enable/disablestatus.  If a current greater than I\nFB(SD) is injected into the FEEDBACK \npin while the power MOSFET is enabled for at least two consecutive cycles the part will stop switching and enter auto-restart off-time.  Normal switching resumes after the auto-restart off-time expires.  This shutdown function allows implementing line overvoltage protection (see Figure 7).  The current into the FEEDBACK pin should be limited to less than 1.2 mA.\n5.0 V Regulator and 5.2 V Shunt Voltage Clamp\nThe 5.0 V regulator charges the bypass capacitor connected to the\nBYPASS pin to V\nBP by drawing a current from the voltage on the\nDRAIN, whenever the power MOSFET is off.  The BYPASS pin is the \ninternal supply voltage node for the LinkSwitch-XT2 IC.  When the power MOSFET is on, the LinkSwitch-XT2 IC runs off of the energy stored in the bypass capacitor.  Extremely low power consumption of the internal circuitry allows the LinkSwitch-XT2 IC to operate continuously from the current drawn from the DRAIN pin.  A bypass capacitor value of 0.1 \nµF i\ns sufficient for both high frequency \ndecoupling and energy storage.\nIn addition, there is a shunt regulator clamping the BYPASS pin atV\nBP(SHUNT) (5.2 V) when current is provided to the BYPASS pin through \nan external resistor.  This facilitates powering of LinkSwitch-XT2 externally through a bias winding to decrease the no-load consump -\ntion to about 10 mW (flyback).  The device stops switching instantly and enters auto-restart when a current ≥I\nBP(SD) is delivered into the \nBYPASS pin.  Adding an external Zener diode from the output voltage to the BYPASS pin allows implementing an hysteretic OVP function (see Figure 6).  The current into the BYPASS pin should be limited to less than 16 mA.BYPASS Pin Undervoltage\nThe BYPASS pin undervoltage circuitry disables the power MOSFETwhen the BYPASS pin voltage drops below V\nBP–VBP(H) (approximately \n4.5 V). Once the BYPASS pin voltage drops below this threshold, it must rise back to V\nBP to enable (turn-on) the power MOSFET.\nOver-Temperature Protection\nThe thermal shutdown circuitry senses the die temperature.  Thethreshold is set at TSD (142 °C typical) with a 75 °C (T\nSD(H)) hyster -\nesis.  When the die temperature rises above TSD the power MOSFET is \ndisabled and remains disabled until the die temperature falls to\nTSD–TSD(H), at which point it is re-enabled.\nCurrent Limit\nThe current limit circuit senses the current in the power MOSFET.When this current exceeds the internal threshold (I\nLIMIT), the power\nMOSFET is turned off for the remainder of that cycle.  The leadingedge blanking circuit inhibits the current limit comparator for a shorttime (t\nLEB) after the power MOSFET is turned on.  This leading edge\nblanking time has been set so that current spikes caused by capaci- \ntance and rectifier reverse recovery time will not cause premature termination of the switching pulse.  Current limit can be selected Figure 5a.  Frequency Jitter (LNK3604).\nFigure 5b.

LinkSwitch-XT2 ICs select between normal \nand reduced current limit at power-up prior to switching.\nAuto-Restart\nIn the event of a fault condition such as output overload, output\nshort, or an open-loop condition, LinkSwitch-XT2 ICs enter intoauto-restart operation.  An internal counter clocked by the oscillatorgets reset every time the FEEDBACK pin is pulled high.  If theFEEDBACK pin is not pulled high for t\nAR(ON) (50 ms), the power\nMOSFET switching is disabled for a time equal to the auto-restartoff-time.  The first time a fault is asserted the off-time is 150 ms(t\nAR(OFF) First Off Period).  If the fault condition persists, subsequent \noff-times are 1500 ms long (tAR(OFF) Subsequent Periods).  The \nauto-restart alternately enables and disables the switching of the\npower MOSFET until the fault condition is removed.  The auto-restartcounter is gated by the switch oscillator.\nHysteretic Output Overvoltage Protection\nThe output overvoltage protection provided by the LinkSwitch-XT2 ICuses auto-restart that is triggered by a current >I\nBP(SD) into the \nBYPASS pin.  In addition to an internal filter, the BYPASS pin capacitor forms an external filter providing noise immunity from inadvertent triggering.  For the bypass capacitor to be effective as a high frequency filter, the capacitor should be located as close as possible to the SOURCE pin and BYPASS pins of the device.\nThe OVP function can be realized by connecting a Zener diode fromthe output supply to the BYPASS pin.  The circuit example shown inFigure 6 describes simple method for implementing the outputovervoltage protection.  Adding additional filtering can be achieved byinserting a low value (10 Ω to 47 Ω) resistor in series with the OVP\n \nFigure 6.  Non-Isolated Flyback Converter with Output Overvoltage Protection.Zener diode.  The resistor in series with the OVP Zener diode alsolimits the maximum current into the BYPASS pin.  The current should \nbe limited to less than 16 mA.\nDuring a fault condition resulting from loss of feedback, the outputvoltage will rapidly rise above the nominal voltage.  A voltage at theoutput that exceeds the sum of the voltage rating of the Zener diodeconnected from the output to the BYPASS pin and bypass voltage, \nwill cause a current in excess of I\nBP(SD) injected into the BYPASS pin, \nwhich will trigger the auto-restart and protect the power supply from\novervoltage.\nLine Overvoltage Protection\nIn a flyback converter the LinkSwitch-XT2 IC senses indirectly the DC \nbus overvoltage condition during the power MOSFET on-time by monitoring the current flowing into the FEEDBACK pin.  Figure 7 shows one possible circuit implementation.  During the power MOSFET on-time, the voltage across the secondary winding is propor-tional to the voltage across the input winding.  The current flowing through transistor Q3 is therefore representing V\nBUS.  Indirect line \nsensing minimizes power dissipation and is used for line OV protection.  The LinkSwitch-XT2 IC will go into auto-restart mode if the FEEDBACK pin current exceeds the line overvoltage threshold current I\nFB(SD) for at \nleast 2 consecutive switching cycles.\nIn order to have accurate line OV threshold voltage and also for goodefficiency, regulation performance and stability, the transformerleakage inductance should be minimized.  Low leakage will minimizeringing on the secondary winding which can introduce an error in theline OV sampling.  In some designs, a RC snubber across the rectifierdiode may be needed to damp the ringing at the secondary windingwhen line voltage is sampled.\nVO\nVBUS\nLinkSwitch-XT2D\nSFB\nBP+\nPI-8119-112816T1\nDOVPRBP\nCBPVOV = VBP + VDOVP+\nRev.

E 09/18\n6\nLNK3604, LNK3694 & 3696Applications Example\nA 5 V, 500 mA (2.5 W) Design\nThe schematic shown in Figure 8 is a typical implementation of a \nuniversal input, 5 V ±5%, 500 mA adapter using LNK3604D.  This \ncircuit makes use of the clampless technique to eliminate the primary clamp components and reduce the complexity of the circuit.\nThe EcoSmart features built into the LinkSwitch-XT2 family allow this \ndesign to easily meet all current and proposed energy efficiency standards, including the mandatory California Energy Commission (CEC) requirement for average operating efficiency.\nThe AC input is rectified by bridge rectifier BR1 and filtered by the \nbulk storage capacitors C1 and C2.  Resistor RF1 is a flameproof, fusible, wire wound type and functions as a fuse, inrush current limiter and, together with the filter formed by C1, C2, L1 and L2, differential mode noise attenuator.  \nThis simple input stage, together with the frequency jittering of \nLinkSwitch-XT2 ICs, and PI’s E-Shield™ windings within T1, allow the design to meet both conducted EMI limits with ≥10 dBV margin.  \nThe rectified and filtered input voltage is applied to the primary \nwinding of T1.  The other side of the primary is driven by the integrated power MOSFET in U1.  No primary clamp is required as the low value and tight tolerance of the LNK3604D IC’s internal current limit allows the primary winding capacitance of the transformer and drain-source capacitance of the power MOSFET in the LNK3604D to provide adequate clamping of the leakage inductance drain voltage spike.\nThe secondary of the flyback transformer T1 is rectified by D3, a \nSchottky diode, and filtered by C6, C7, low ESR capacitor.  The output voltage is sensed via resistor divider R5 and R6.  Output voltage is regulated so as to achieve a voltage of 2 V on the FEEDBACK pin.  To achieve <10 mW no-load input power, we can also use the Zener to do the feedback sense.  The combined voltage drop across VR2, emitter to base voltage drop of transistor Q2 (V\nEB(Q2)) and R8 \ndetermines the output voltage.  When the output voltage exceeds this level, current will flow through transistor Q2.  As the current increases, the current fed into the FEEDBACK pin of U1 increases until the turnoff threshold current (~49 \nµA\n) is reached, disabling further \nswitching cycles of U1.  At full load, almost all switching cycles will be enabled, and at very light loads, almost all the switching cycles will be disabled, giving a low effective frequency and providing high light load efficiency and low no-load consumption.\nResistor R7 provides ≈150 \nµA t\nhrough VR2 to bias the Zener diode \ncloser to its test current.  The diode used is a low test current Zener diode which needs only 50 \nµA t\no conduct, this will provide <10 mW \nno-load input power.  Resistor R8 limits the current into FEEDBACK pin to less than 1.2 mA for protection.  For higher output accuracy, the Zener diode may be replaced with a reference IC such as the TL431.  \nThe LinkSwitch-XT2 ICs can be completely self-powered from the \nDRAIN pin, requiring only a small ceramic capacitor C3 connected to the BYPASS pin.  Resistor R2 supplies the BYPASS pin externally from the auxiliary winding for significantly lower no-load input power and increased efficiency over all load conditions.  To achieve lowest no-load power consumption, the current fed into the BYPASS pin should be slightly higher than 120 \nµA\n.  For the best full load efficiency \nand thermal performance, the current fed into the BYPASS pin should be slightly higher than 257 \nµA.PI-8148-102716D\nSFB\nBP/MR5\n3.57 kΩ\n1%D1\nDFLR1200-7\n200 V\nR2\n20 kΩ\n1%R8\n200 Ω\n1/8 wR7\n4.7 kΩ\n1/8 w\nVR2\nMMSZ4687T1G\n4.3 V\n<10 mW no-load input power can be \nachieved with Zener diode feedbackQ2\nMMST4403-7-FR4\n16 Ω\nR6\n2.49 kΩ\n1%D3\nSS24-E3/52TT1\nEE135 6\n10\n1\n24C7\n470 µF\n10 VC5\n1 nF\n50 V\nC6\n470 µF\n10 V\nC1\n3.3 µF\n400 VC2\n3.3 µF\n400 V\nC4\n1 µF\n50 VC3\n22 µF\n25 V\nL1\n1 mHL2\nFerrite Bead\n(3.5 × 4.45 mm)\nU1\nLNK3604DLinkSwitch-XT2BR1\nB10S-G\n1000 VRF1\n8.2 Ω\n2 W\n85 - 265\nVACL\nTP1\nN\nTP25 V, 500 mA\nTP3\nRTN\nTP4\nVO\nFB\nRTN\nwww.power.com \nRev.

T\nhe minimum DC input voltage is 90 V or higher for 85 VAC input, \nor 240 V or higher for 230 VAC input or 115 VAC with a voltage \ndoubler.  The value of the input capacitance should be large enough to meet these criteria for AC input designs.  \n2.\n S\necondary output of 6 V with a fast PN rectifier diode.  \n3. A\nssumed efficiency of 70%.  \n4. V\noltage only output (no secondary-side constant current circuit).  \n5. A p\nrimary clamp (RCD or Zener) is used.  \n6. T\nhe part is board mounted with SOURCE pins soldered to a \nsufficient area of copper to keep the SOURCE pin temperature at or below 100 °C.  \n7.\n A\nmbient temperature of 50 °C for open frame designs and an \ninternal enclosure temperature of 60 °C for adapter designs.\nDiscontinuous mode operation (KP > 1) is recommended for LNK3604.  \nBelow a value of 1, KP is the ratio of ripple to peak primary current.  Above a value of 1, KP is the ratio of primary power MOSFET OFF-time to the secondary diode conduction time.  Due to the flux density requirements described below, typically a LinkSwitch-XT2 design will be discontinuous, which also has the benefits of allowing fast (instead of ultrafast) output diodes and reducing EMI.\nClampless Designs \nClampless designs rely solely on the drain node capacitance to limit \nthe leakage inductance induced peak drain-to-source voltage.  \nTherefore, the maximum AC input line voltage, the value of VOR, the leakage inductance energy, a function of leakage inductance and peak primary current, and the primary winding capacitance determine the peak drain voltage.  With no significant dissipative element present, as is the case with an external clamp, the longer duration of the leakage inductance ringing can increase EMI.  \nThe following requirements are recommended for a universal input or \n230 VAC only clampless design: \n1.\n A c\nlampless design should only be used for PO ≤ 2.5 W, using the \nreduced current limit mode (CBP = 1 µF ) and a VOR** ≤ 90 V.\n2.\n F\nor designs where PO ≤ 2 W, a two-layer primary should be used \nto ensure adequate primary intra-winding capacitance in the \nrange of 25 pF to 50 pF.  \n3.\n F\nor designs where 2 < PO ≤ 2.5 W, a bias winding should be \nadded to the transformer using a standard recovery rectifier diode to act as a clamp.  This bias winding may also be used to externally power the device by connecting a resistor from the bias-winding capacitor to the BYPASS pin.  This inhibits the internal high-voltage current source, reducing device dissipation and no-load consumption.  \n4.\n F\nor designs where PO > 2.5 W clampless designs are not practical \nand an external RCD or Zener clamp should be used.  \n5.\n E\nnsure that worst-case high line, peak drain voltage is below the \nBVDSS specification of the internal power MOSFET and ideally  \n< VDSS × 0.9 to allow margin for design variation.\n†For 110 VAC only input designs it may be possible to extend the \npower range of clampless designs to include the standard current limit mode.  However, the increased leakage ringing may degrade  EMI performance.  **VOR is the secondary output plus output diode forward voltage \ndrop that is reflected to the primary via the turns ratio of the transformer during the diode conduction time.  The VOR adds to the DC bus voltage and the leakage spike to determine the peak drain voltage.\nAudible Noise \nThe cycle skipping mode of operation used in LinkSwitch-XT2 ICs can \ngenerate audio frequency components in the transformer.  To limit \nthis audible noise generation, the transformer should be designed such that the peak core flux density is below 1500 gauss (150 mT).  Following this guideline and using the standard transformer produc-tion technique of dip varnishing practically eliminates audible noise.  Vacuum impregnation of the transformer should not be used due to the high primary capacitance and increased losses that result.  Higher flux densities are possible, however careful evaluation of the audible noise performance should be made using production transformer samples before approving the design.  \nCeramic capacitors that use dielectrics, such as Z5U, when used in \nclamp circuits may also generate audio noise.  If this is the case, try replacing them with a capacitor having a different dielectric or construction, for example a film type.  \nLinkSwitch-XT2 Layout Considerations \nSee Figures 9, 10 and 11 for a recommended circuit board layout for \nLinkSwitch-XT2 (D, P and G packages).  \nSingle Point Grounding \nUse a single point ground connection from the input filter capacitor to \nthe area of copper connected to the SOURCE pins.Bypass Capacitor C\nBP\nThe BYPASS pin capacitor should be located as near as possible to \nthe BYPASS and SOURCE pins.Primary Loop Area\nThe area of the primary loop that connects the input filter capacitor, \ntransformer primary and LinkSwitch-XT2 IC together should be kept \nas small as possible.\nPrimary Clamp Circuit\nA clamp is used to limit peak voltage on the DRAIN pin at turn-off.  \nThis can be achieved by using an RCD clamp or a Zener (~200 V) and \ndiode clamp across the primary winding.  In all cases, to minimize EMI, care should be taken to minimize the circuit path from the clamp components to the transformer and LinkSwitch-XT2 IC.\nThermal Considerations\nThe copper area underneath the LinkSwitch-XT2 IC acts not only as a \nsingle point ground, but also as a heat sink.  As this area is connected \nto the quiet source node, it should be maximized for good heat sinking of LinkSwitch-XT2 IC.  The same applies to the cathode of the output diode.\nY Capacitor\nY capacitor is generally not used for this power level.  If you want to \nuse, the placement of the Y type capacitor should be directly from \nthe primary input filter capacitor positive terminal to the common/return terminal of the transformer secondary.  Such a placement will route high magnitude common mode surge currents away from the LinkSwitch-XT2 device.  Note that if an input pi (C, L, C) EMI filter is used, then the inductor in the filter should be placed between the negative terminals of the input filter capacitors.\nwww.power.c om \nRev. E 09/188\nLNK3604, LNK3694 & 3696Feedback Signal\nPlace the transistor Q2 physically close to the LinkSwitch-XT2 IC to \nminimize trace lengths from the transistor to FEEDBACK pin.  Keep \nthe high current, high-voltage drain and clamp traces away from the feedback signal to prevent noise pick up.\nOutput Diode\nFor best performance, the area of the loop connecting the secondary \nwinding, the output diode and the output filter capacitor should be \nminimized.  In addition, sufficient copper area should be provided at the anode and cathode terminals of the diode for heat sinking.  A larger area is preferred at the quiet cathode terminal.  A large anode area can increase high frequency radiated EMI.\nQuick Design Checklist\nAs with any power supply design, all LinkSwitch-XT2 designs should \nbe verified on the bench to make sure that component specifications are not exceeded under worst-case conditions.  The following minimum set of tests is strongly recommended:\n1.\n M\naximum drain voltage – Verify that VDS does not exceed 90% \nof BVDSS at the highest input voltage and peak (overload) output \npower.  The 10% margin versus BVDSS specification gives margin \nfor design variation, especially in clampless designs.2.  \n M\naximum drain current – At maximum ambient temperature, \nmaximum input voltage and peak output (overload) power, verify \ndrain current waveforms for any signs of transformer saturation and excessive leading edge current spikes at start-up.  Repeat under steady state conditions and verify that the leading-edge current spike event is below I\nLIMIT(MIN) at the end of the tLEB(MIN).  \nUnder all conditions, the maximum drain current should be below the specified absolute maximum ratings.\n3.  \n T\nhermal Check – At specified maximum output power, minimum \ninput voltage and maximum ambient temperature, verify that the temperature specifications are not exceeded for LinkSwitch-XT2 IC, transformer, output diode and output capacitors.  Enough thermal margin should be allowed for part-to-part variation of the R\nDS(ON) \nof LinkSwitch-XT2 IC as specified in the data sheet.  Under low-line, maximum power, a maximum LinkSwitch-XT2 IC SOURCE pin temperature of 100 °C is recommended to allow for these variations.\nDesign Tools\nUp-to-date information on design tools can be found at the Power \nIntegrations website: www.power.com\n \nFigure 9.
