See the PCB Layout and Thermal Considerations \nsections for more details. Return the RFB1/RFB2 feedback \ndivider to this net.\nVOUT (Bank 2): Power Output Pins. Apply output filter \ncapacitors between these pins and GND pins. V\nIN (Bank 3): Input Power. The VIN pin supplies current to \nthe LTM8056’ s internal power switches and to one terminal  \nof the optional input current sense resistor. This pin must \nbe locally bypassed with an external, low ESR capacitor; \nsee Table 1 for recommended values.I\nOUT (Pin D1): Output Current Sense. Tie this pin to the \noutput current sense resistor. The output average current \nsense threshold is 58mV, so the LTM8056 will regulate \nthe output current to 58mV/R SENSE , where R SENSE  is the \nvalue of the output current sense resistor in ohms. The \nload is powered through the sense resistor connected at \nthis pin. Tie this pin to VOUT if no output current sense \nresistor is used. Keep this pin within ±0.5V of VOUT under \nall conditions.LL (Pin F1): Light Load Indicator. This open drain pin \nindicates that the output current, as sensed through the \nresistor connected between VOUT and IOUT, is approxi -\nmately equivalent to 6mV or less. Its state is meaningful \nonly if a current sense resistor is applied between VOUT \nand IOUT. This is useful to change the switching behavior \nof the LTM8056 in light load conditions.\nSVIN (Pins F10, F11): Controller Power Input. Apply a \nseparate voltage above 5V if the LTM8056 is required to \noperate when the main power input (V IN) is below 5V. \nBypass these pins with a high quality, low ESR capacitor. \nIf a separate supply is not used, connect these pins to VIN.\nCLKOUT (Pin G1): Clock Output. Use this pin as a clock \nsource when synchronizing other devices to the switch -\ning frequency of the LTM8056. When this function is not \nused, leave this pin open.MODE (Pin G2): Switching Mode Input. The LTM8056 \noperates in forced continuous mode when MODE is \nopen, and \ncan operate in discontinuous switching mode \nwhen MODE is low. In discontinuous switching mode, \nthe LTM8056 will block reverse inductor current. This pin \nis normally left open or tied to LL. This pin may be tied \nto GND for the purpose of blocking reverse current if no \noutput sense resistor is used.CTL VOL TAGE (V)OUTPUT CURRENT (A)4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n8056 G281.4 0 0.4 0.7 1.1VOUT\n5V/DIV\n8056 G29500µs/DIV\nCSS = 22nF\nCSS = 100nFCSS = 220nF\n24VIN, 3A LOAD\n(BUCK-B00ST),\n100mV/DIV\n48VIN, 3A LOAD\n(Buck),\n100mV/DIV12VIN, 1.5A LOAD\n(B00ST),\n100mV/DIV\nMEASURED ACROSS C17 ON DC2154A WITH HP461 \nAMPLIFIER, 150MHz BANDWIDTH8056 G301µs/DIV\nLTM80568\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM8056PIN FUNCTIONS\nRT (Pin H1): Timing Resistor. The RT pin is used to program  \nthe switching frequency of the LTM8056 by connecting a \nresistor from this pin to ground. The range of oscillation is \n100kHz to 800kHz. The Applications Information section of \nthe data sheet includes a table to determine the resistance \nvalue based on the desired switching frequency. Minimize \ncapacitance at this pin. A resistor to ground must be ap-\nplied under all circumstances.\nSYNC (Pin H2): External Synchronization Input. The SYNC \npin has an internal pull-down resistor. See the Synchroni -\nzation section in Applications Information for details. Tie \nthis pin to GND when not used. \nFB (Pin J1): Output Voltage Feedback. The LTM8056 \nregulates the FB pin to 1.2V. Connect the FB pin to a \nresistive divider between the output and GND to set the \noutput voltage. See Table 1 for recommended FB divider \nresistor values.\nCOMP (Pin J2): Compensation Pin. The LTM8056 is \nequipped with internal compensation that works well with \nmost applications. In some cases, the performance of the \nLTM8056 can be enhanced by modifying the control loop \ncompensation by applying a capacitor or RC network to \nthis pin.SS (Pin \nK1): Soft-Start. Connect a capacitor from this pin \nto GND to increase the soft-start time. Soft-start reduces \nthe input power source’s surge current by gradually in-\ncreasing the controller’s current limit. Larger values of the \nsoft-start capacitor result in longer soft-start times. If no \nsoft-start is required, leave this pin open.CTL (Pin K2): Current Sense Adjustment. Apply a voltage \nbelow 1.2V to reduce the current limit threshold of IOUT.\nDrive CTL to less than about 50mV to stop switching. The \nCTL pin has an internal pull-up resistor to 2V. If not used, \nleave this pin open.I\nOUTMON  (Pin L2): Output Current Monitor. This pin pro-\nduces a voltage that is proportional to the voltage between \nVOUT and IOUT. IOUTMON  will equal 1.2V when VOUT – IOUT \n= 58mV. This feature is generally useful only if a current \nsense resistor is applied between VOUT and IOUT. This is \na high impedance output. Use a buffer to drive a load.\nIINMON  (Pin L3): Input Current Monitor. This pin produces \na voltage that is proportional to the voltage between IIN \nand VIN. IINMON  will equal 1V when IIN-VIN = 50mV. This \nfeature is generally useful only if a current sense resistor \nis applied between V IN and I IN. \nRUN ( Pin L4): LTM8056 Enable. Raise the RUN pin voltage  \nabove 1.2V for normal operation. Above 1.2V (typical), but \nbelow 6V, the RUN pin input bias current is less than 1μA. \nBelow 1.2V and above 0.3V, the RUN pin sinks 3μA so \nthe user can define the hysteresis with the external resis-\ntor selection. This will also reset the soft-start function. \nIf RUN is 0.3V or less, the LTM8056 is disabled and the \nSVIN quiescent current is below 1μA.\nIIN (Pin L9): Input Current Sense. Tie this pin to the input \ncurrent sense resistor. The input average current sense \nthreshold is 50mV, so the LTM8056 will regulate the input \ncurrent to 50mV/R SENSE , where RSENSE  is the value of the \ninput current sense resistor in ohms. Tie to VIN when not \nused. Keep this pin within ±0.5V  of VIN under all conditions.\nLTM80569\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM8056BLOCK DIAGRAM\n0.2µF6.8µH\n0.1µF\n100V\n0.1µF\nCTL\nCOMP RT SYNC100k2V\n100k\nIOUTMON\n8056 BDIINMONCLKOUTFBIOUTVOUT\nSSGNDRUNIINVIN\nSVIN\nBUCK-BOOST CONTROLLER\nLL MODE\nLTM805610\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM8056OPERATION\nThe LTM8056 is a standalone nonisolated buck-boost \nswitching DC/DC power supply. The buck-boost topol -\nogy allows the LTM8056 to regulate its output voltage \nfor input voltages both above and below the magnitude \nof the output, and the maximum output current depends \nupon the input voltage. Higher input voltages yield higher \nmaximum output current. \nThis converter provides a precisely regulated output volt-\nage programmable via an external resistor divider from \n1.2V to 48V. The input voltage range is 5V to 58V, but the \nLTM8056 may be operated at lower input voltages if SVIN \nis powered by a voltage source above 5V. A simplified \nblock diagram is given on the previous page.\nThe LTM8056 contains a current mode controller, power \nswitching elements, power inductor and a modest amount \nof input and output capacitance. The LTM8056 is a fixed \nfrequency PWM  regulator. The switching frequency is set \nby connecting the appropriate resistor value from the RT \npin to GND.\nThe output voltage  of the LTM8056 is set by connecting  the \nFB pin to a resistor divider between the output and GND.\nIn addition to regulating its output voltage, the LTM8056 \nis equipped with average current control loops for both the \ninput and output. Add a current sense resistor between IIN \nand VIN to limit the input current below some maximum \nvalue. The IINMON  pin reflects the current flowing though \nthe sense resistor between I IN and V IN.\nA current sense resistor between VOUT and IOUT allows \nthe LTM8056 to accurately regulate its output current to \na maximum value set by the value of the sense resistor. In general, the LTM8056 should be used with an output \nsense resistor to limit the maximum output current, as \nbuck-boost regulators are capable of delivering large cur-\nrents when the output voltage is lower than the input, if \ndemanded. Furthermore, while the LTM8056 does not require an \noutput sense resistor to operate, it uses information from \nthe sense resistor to optimize its performance. If an out-\nput sense resistor is not used, the efficiency or output \nripple may degrade, especially if the current through the \nintegrated inductor is discontinuous. In some cases, an \noutput sense resistor is required to adequately protect the \nLTM8056 against output overload or short-circuit.\nA voltage less than 1.2V applied to the CTL pin reduces \nthe maximum output\n current if an output current sense \nresistor is used. Drive CTL to less than about 50mV to stop \nswitching. The current flowing through the sense resistor \nis reflected by the output voltage of the I OUTMON  pin.\nDriving the SYNC pin will synchronize the LTM8056 to an \nexternal clock source. The CLKOUT pin sources a signal \nthat is the same frequency but approximately 180° out of \nphase with the internal oscillator.\nIf more output current is required than a single LTM8056 \ncan provide, multiple devices may be operated in parallel. \nRefer to the Parallel Operation section of Applications \nInformation for more details.\nAn internal regulator provides power to the control circuitry  \nand the gate driver to the power MOSFETs. This internal \nregulator draws power from the SVIN pin. The RUN pin is \nused to place the LTM8056 in shutdown, disconnecting \nthe output and reducing the input current to less than 1μA.\nThe LTM8056 is equipped with a thermal shutdown that \ninhibits power switching at high junction temperatures. \nThe activation threshold of this function is above 125°C \nto avoid interfering with normal operation, so prolonged \nor repetitive operation under a condition in which the \nthermal shutdown activates may damage or impair the \nreliability of the device.\nLTM805611\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM8056APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFor most applications, the design process is straight for-\nward, summarized as follows: \n1.  Look at Table 1 and find the row that has the desired \ninput range and output voltage.\n2.  Apply the recommended CIN, COUT, RFB1/RFB2 and RT \nvalues.\n3.  Apply the output sense resistor to set the output current \nlimit. The output current is limited to 58mV/R SENSE , \nwhere RSENSE  is the value of the output current sense \nresistor in ohms.\nWhile these component combinations have been tested for \nproper operation, it is incumbent upon the user to verify \nproper operation over the intended system’s line, load and \nenvironmental conditions. Bear in mind that the maximum \noutput current is limited by junction temperature, the rela-\ntionship between the input and output voltage magnitude \nand other factors. Please refer to the graphs in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics section for guidance. The maximum frequency (and attendant RT value) at \nwhich the LTM8056 should be allowed to switch is given \nin Table 1 in the fMAX column, while the recommended \nfrequency (and RT value) for optimal efficiency over the \ngiven input condition is given in the fOPTIMAL  column. \nThere are additional conditions that must be satisfied if \nthe synchronization function is used. Please refer to the \nSynchronization section for details.\nNote that Table 1 calls out both ceramic and electrolytic \noutput capacitors. Both of the capacitors called out in \nthe table must be applied to the output. The electrolytic \ncapacitors in Table 1 are described by voltage rating, \nvalue and ESR. The voltage rating of the capacitor may \nbe increased if the application requires a higher voltage \nstress derating. The LTM8056 can tolerate variation  \nin the ESR; other capacitors with different ESR may \nbe used, but the user must verify proper operation  \nover line, load and environmental conditions.

Other combinations of \nresistor values for the RFB network are acceptable.\nLTM805612\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM8056APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nCapacitor Selection Considerations\nThe CIN and COUT capacitor values in Table 1 are the \nminimum recommended values for the associated oper-\nating conditions. Applying capacitor values below those \nindicated in Table 1 is not recommended, and may result \nin undesirable operation. Using larger values is generally \nacceptable, and can yield improved dynamic response, if \nit is necessary. Again, it is incumbent upon the user to \nverify proper operation over the intended system’s line, \nload and environmental conditions.Ceramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However, not all ceramic capacitors are suitable. \nX5R and X7R types are stable over temperature and ap\n-\nplied voltage and give dependable service. Other types, \nincluding Y5V and Z5U have very large temperature and \nvoltage coefficients of capacitance. In an application cir-\ncuit they may have only a small fraction of their nominal \ncapacitance resulting in much higher output voltage ripple \nthan expected.A final precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns \nthe maximum input voltage rating of the LTM8056. A \nceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable \ninductance forms a high Q (underdamped) tank circuit. \nIf the LTM8056 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the \ninput voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, possi -\nbly exceeding the device’s rating. This situation is easily \navoided; see the Hot-Plugging Safely section.\nFrequency Selection\nThe LTM8056 uses a constant frequency PWM  architec -\nture that can be programmed to switch from 100kHz to 800kHz by tying a resistor from the RT pin to ground. \nTable 3 provides a list of RT resistor values and their re-\nsultant frequencies.\nTable 3.

Even when synchronizing to \nan external clock. When synchronizing the switching of \nthe LTM8056 to an external signal source, the frequency \nrange is 200kHz to 700kHz.\nOperating Frequency T rade-Offs\nIt is recommended that the user apply the optimal RT \nvalue given in Table 1 for the input and output operating \ncondition. System level or other considerations, however, \nmay necessitate another operating frequency. While the \nLTM8056 is flexible enough to accommodate a wide range \nof operating frequencies, a haphazardly chosen one may \nresult in undesirable operation under certain operating or \nfault conditions. A frequency that is too high can reduce \nefficiency, generate excessive heat or even damage the Table 2.

Each LTM8056 is \nequipped with an IOUTMON  and a CTL pin. The IOUTMON  \npin’s 0V to 1.2V signal reflects the current passing through \nthe output sense resistor, while a voltage less than 1.2V  \napplied  to the CTL pin will limit the current  passing  through \nthe output sense resistor. By applying the voltage of the \nmaster’s IOUTMON  pin to the slave’s CTL pin, the two units \nwill source the same current to the load, assuming each \nLTM8056 output current sense resistor is the same value.2. Apply a FB resistor network to the individual slaves \nso that the resulting output is higher than the desired \noutput voltage.  \n3. Apply the appropriate output current sense resistors \nbetween VOUT and IOUT. If the same value is used for the \nmaster and slave units, they will share current equally.  \n4. Connect the master IOUTMON  to the slaves’ CTL pin \nthrough a unity gain buffer. The unity gain buffer is \nrequired to isolate the output impedance of the LTM8056  \nfrom the integrated pull-up on the CTL pins.\n5. Tie the outputs together.\nNote that this configuration does not require the inputs to \nbe tied together, making it simple to power a single heavy \nload from multiple input sources.  Ensure that each input \npower source has sufficient voltage and current sourcing \ncapability to provide the necessary power. Please refer \nto the Maximum Output Current vs VIN and Input Current \nvs Output Current curves in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section for guidance.\nParalleled LTM8056s  should normally be allowed to switch  \nin discontinuous mode enabled to prevent current from \nflowing from the output of one unit into another; that is, \nthe MODE pin should be tied to LL. In some cases, operat -\ning the master in forced continuous (MODE open) and the \nslaves in discontinuous mode (MODE = LL) is desirable. \nIf so, current from the output can flow into the master’s \ninput. Please refer to Input Precaution in this section for \na discussion of this behavior.\nMinimum Input Voltage and RUN\nThe LTM8056 needs a minimum of 5V for proper opera -\ntion, but system parameters may dictate that the device \noperate only above some higher input voltage. For ex-\nample, a LTM8056 may be used to produce 12V OUT, but \nthe input power source may not be budgeted to provide \nenough current if the input supply voltage is below 8V.The RUN pin has a typical falling voltage threshold of \n1.2V and a typical hysteresis of 25mV. In addition, the \npin sinks 3µA below the RUN threshold. Based upon the Figure 1.

The current \nlimit is:\n  IOUT(LIM)=58mV\nRSENSE\nwhere R SENSE  is the value of the sense resistor in ohms.\nMost applications should use an output sense resistor as \nshown in Figure 3, if practical. The internal buck-boost \npower stage is current limited, but is nonetheless capable \nof delivering large amounts of current in an overload \ncondition, especially when the output voltage is much \nlower than the input and the power stage is operating as \na buck converter.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nRUNL TM8056\nVIN\nR1\nR2\n8056 F02\nFigure 2. This Simple Resistor Network Sets the Minimum \nOperating Input Voltage Threshold with Hysteresis IOUTL TM8056\nVOUTRSENSE\n8056 F03LOAD\nFigure 3. Set The LTM8056 Output Current Limit with an External Sense ResistorMinimum Input Voltage and SV IN\nThe minimum input voltage of the LTM8056 is 5V, but this \nis only if VIN and SVIN are tied to the same voltage source. \nIf SVIN is powered from a power source at or above 5VDC, \nVIN can be allowed to fall below 5V and the LTM8056 can \nstill operate properly. Some examples of this are provided \nin the Typical Applications section.\nSoft-Start\nSoft- start reduces the input power sources’ surge currents  \nby gradually increasing the controller’ s current. As indicated  \nin the Block Diagram, the LTM8056 has an internal soft-\nstart RC network. Depending upon the load and operating \nconditions, the internal network may be sufficient for the \napplication. To increase the soft-start time, simply add a \ncapacitor from SS to GND.\nOutput Current Limit (I OUT)\nThe LTM8056 features an accurate average output current \nlimit set by an external sense resistor placed between VOUT \nand IOUT as shown in Figure 3. V OUT and IOUT internally \nconnect to a differential amplifier that limits the current When the voltage across the output sense resistor falls \nto about 1/10 th of full scale, the LL pin pulls low. If there \nis no output sense resistor, and IOUT is tied to VOUT, LL \nwill be active low. Applying an output sense resistor and \ntying the LL and MODE pins together can improve perfor -\nmance—see Switching Mode in this section.\nIn high step-down voltage regulator applications, the \ninternal current limit can be quite high to allow proper \noperation. This can potentially damage the LTM8056 \nin overload or short-circuit conditions. Apply an output \ncurrent sense resistor to set an appropriate current limit \nto protect the LTM8056 against these fault conditions.\nOutput Current Limit Control (CTL)\nUse the CTL input to reduce the output current limit from \nthe value set by the external sense resistor applied between  \nVOUT and IOUT. The typical control range is between 0V \nand 1.2V. The CTL pin does not directly affect the input \nLTM805615\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM8056current limit. If this function is not used, leave CTL open. \nDrive CTL to less than about 50mV to stop switching.  The \nCTL pin has an internal pull-up resistor to 2V.\nInput Current Limit (I IN)\nSome applications require that the LTM8056 draw no more  \nthan some predetermined current from the power source. \nCurrent limited power sources and power sharing are two \nexamples. The LTM8056 features an accurate input current  \nlimit set by an external sense resistor placed between IIN \nand VIN as shown in Figure 4. V IN and IIN internally connect \nto a differential amplifier that limits the current when the \nvoltage I IN-VIN reaches 50mV. The current limit is:\n  IIN(LIM)=50mV\nRSENSE\nwhere R SENSE  is the value of the sense resistor in ohms.\nIf input current limiting is not required, simply tie IIN to VIN.Synchronization\nThe LTM8056 switching frequency can be synchronized to \nan external clock using the SYNC pin. Driving SYNC with \na 50% duty cycle waveform is a good choice, otherwise \nmaintain the duty cycle between about 10% and 90%. When  \nsynchronizing, a valid resistor value (that is, a value that \nresults in a free-running frequency of 100kHz to 800kHz) \nmust be connected from RT  to GND.\nWhile an RT resistor is required for proper operation, the \nvalue of this resistor is independent of the frequency of \nthe externally applied SYNC signal. Be aware, however, \nthat the LTM8056 will switch at the frequency prescribed \nby the RT value if the SYNC signal terminates, so choose \nan appropriate resistor value.\nCLKOUT\nThe CLKOUT signal reflects the internal switching clock of \nthe LTM8056 . It is phase shifted  by approximately  180° with \nrespect to the leading edge of the internal clock. If CLKOUT \nis connected to the SYNC input of another LTM8056, the \ntwo devices will switch about 180° out of phase.\nInput Precaution\nIn applications where the output voltage is deliberately \npulled up above the set regulation voltage or the FB pin is \nabruptly driven to a new voltage, the LTM8056 may attempt  \nto regulate the voltage by removing energy from the load \nfor a short period of time after the output is pulled up. \nSince the LTM8056 is a synchronous switching converter, \nit delivers this energy to the input. If there is nothing on the \nLTM8056 input to consume this energy, the input voltage \nmay rise. If the input voltage rises without intervention, it \nmay rise above the absolute maximum rating, damaging \nthe part. Carefully examine the input voltage behavior to \nsee if the application causes it to rise.\nIn many cases, the system load on the LTM8056 input \nbus will be sufficient to absorb the energy delivered by the \nμModule regulator. The power required by other devices \nwill consume more than enough to make up for what APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 4. Set the LTM8056 Input Current Limit with an External \nSense ResistorIINL TM8056 RSENSE\nVINPOWER\nSOURCE\n8056 F04\nInput Current Monitor (I INMON )\nThe IINMON  pin produces a voltage equal to approximately \n20 times the voltage of IIN-VIN. Since the LTM8056 input \ncurrent limit engages when IIN-VIN = 50mV, IINMON  will \nbe 1V at maximum input current.\nOutput Current Monitor (I OUTMON )\nThe IOUTMON  pin produces a voltage proportional to the \nvoltage of VOUT-IOUT. Since the LTM8056 output current \nlimit engages when VOUT-IOUT = 58mV, IOUTMON  will be \n1.2V at maximum output current.\nLTM805616\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM8056the LTM8056 delivers. In cases where the LTM8056 is \nthe largest or only power converter, this may not be true \nand some means may need to be devised to prevent the \nLTM8056’s input from rising too high. Figure 5a shows a \npassive crowbar circuit that will dissipate energy during \nmomentary input overvoltage conditions. The break- down  \nvoltage of the Zener diode is chosen in conjunction with \nthe resistor R to set the circuit’s trip point. The trip point \nis typically set well above the maximum VIN voltage under \nnormal operating conditions. This circuit does not have \na precision threshold, and is subject to both part-to-part \nand temperature variations, so it is most suitable for ap -\nplications where the maximum input voltage is much less \nthan the 60V IN absolute maximum. As stated earlier, this \ntype of circuit is best suited for momentary overvoltages.\nFigure 5a is a crowbar circuit, which attempts to prevent \nthe input voltage from rising above some level by dumping \nenergy to GND through a power device. In some cases, \nit is possible to simply turn off the LTM8056 when the \ninput voltage exceeds some threshold. An example of this \ncircuit is shown in Figure 5b. When the power source on \nthe output drives VIN above a predetermined threshold, \nthe comparator pulls down on the RUN pin and stops \nswitching in the LTM8056. When this happens, the input \ncapacitance needs to absorb the energy stored within the \nLTM8056’s internal inductor, resulting in an additional \nvoltage rise. This voltage rise depends upon the input \ncapacitor size and how much current is flowing from the \nLTM8056 output to input.Switching Mode\nThe MODE pin allows the user to select either discontinuous  \nmode or forced continuous mode switching operation. In \nforced continuous mode, the LTM8056 will not skip cycles, \neven when the internal inductor current falls to zero or even \nreverses direction. This has the advantage of operating at \nthe same fixed frequency for all load conditions, which can \nbe useful when designing to EMI or output noise speci -\nfications. Forced continuous mode, however, uses more \ncurrent at light loads, and allows current to flow from the \nload back into the input if the output is raised above the \nregulation point. This reverse current can raise the input \nvoltage and be hazardous if the input is allowed to rise \nuncontrollably. Please refer to Input Precautions in this \nsection for a discussion of this behavior.Forced continuous operation may provide improved  \noutput regulation when the LTM8056 transitions from \nbuck, buck-boost or boost operating modes, especially at \nlighter loads. In such a case, it can be desirable to oper\n-\nate in forced continuous mode except when the internal \ninductor current is about to reverse. If so, apply a current \nsense resistor between VOUT and IOUT and tie the LL and \nMODE pins together. The LL pin is low when the current \nthrough the output sense resistor is about one-tenth the \nfull-scale maximum. When the output current falls to this \nlevel, the LL pin will pull the MODE pin down, putting the \nLTM8056 in discontinuous mode, preventing reverse cur-\nrent from flowing from the output to the input.

The location at which \nthe output voltage is sensed affects the load regulation. \nIf there is a current sense resistor between VOUT and \nIOUT, and the output is sensed at VOUT, the voltage at the \nload will drop by the value of the current sense resistor \nmultiplied by the output current. If the output voltage can \nbe sensed at I OUT, the load regulation may be improved.\nPCB Layout\nMost of the headaches associated with PCB layout have \nbeen alleviated or even eliminated by the high level of \nintegration of the LTM8056. The LTM8056 is neverthe -\nless a switching power supply, and care must be taken to \nminimize EMI and ensure proper operation. Even with the \nhigh level of integration, you may fail to achieve specified \noperation with a haphazard or poor layout. See Figure 6 \nfor a suggested layout. Ensure that the grounding and \nheat sinking are acceptable.\nA few rules to keep in mind are:\n1. Place the RFB and RT resistors as close as possible to \ntheir respective pins.\n2. Place the CIN capacitor as close as possible to the VIN \nand GND connection of the LTM8056.\n3. Place the COUT capacitor as close as possible to the \nVOUT and GND connection of the LTM8056.\n4. Minimize the trace resistance between the optional \noutput current sense resistor, ROUT, and VOUT.  Minimize  \nthe loop area of the IOUT trace and the trace from VOUT \nto R OUT.5. Minimize the trace resistance between the optional input  \ncurrent sense resistor (R IN) and VIN. Minimize the loop \narea of the I IN trace and the trace from V IN to R IN.\n6. Place the CIN and COUT capacitors such that their \nground current flow directly adjacent or underneath \nthe LTM8056.\n7. Connect all of the GND connections to as large a copper \npour or plane area as possible on the top layer. Avoid \nbreaking the ground connection between the external \ncomponents and the LTM8056.\n8. Use vias to connect the GND copper area to the board’s \ninternal ground planes. Liberally distribute these GND \nvias to provide both a good ground connection and \nthermal path to the internal planes of the printed circuit \nboard. Pay attention to the location and density of the \nthermal vias in Figure 6. The LTM8056 can benefit from \nthe heat sinking afforded by vias that connect to internal \nGND planes at these locations, due to their proximity \nto internal power handling components. The optimum \nnumber of thermal vias depends upon the printed \ncircuit board design. For example, a board might use \nvery small via holes. It should employ more thermal \nvias than a board that uses larger holes.\nHot-Plugging Safely\nThe small size, robustness and low impedance of ceramic \ncapacitors make them an attractive option for the input \nbypass capacitor of the LTM8056. However, these capaci -\ntors can cause problems if the LTM8056 is plugged into a \nlive supply (see Linear Technology Application Note\xa088 for \na complete discussion). The low loss ceramic capacitor \ncombined with stray inductance in series with the power \nsource forms an underdamped tank circuit, and the volt-\nage at the VIN pin of the LTM8056 can ring to more than \ntwice the nominal input voltage, possibly exceeding the \nLTM8056’ s rating and damaging the part. If the input supply  APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTM805618\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM8056is poorly controlled or the LTM8056 is hot-plugged into an \nenergized supply, the input network should be designed \nto prevent this overshoot. This can be accomplished by \ninstalling a small resistor in series with VIN, but the most \npopular method of controlling input voltage overshoot is \nto add an electrolytic bulk capacitor to the VIN net. This \ncapacitor’s relatively high equivalent series resistance \ndamps the circuit and eliminates the voltage overshoot. \nThe extra capacitor improves low frequency ripple filter-\ning and can slightly improve the efficiency of the circuit, \nthough it is likely to be the largest component in the circuit. Thermal Considerations\nThe LTM8056 output current may need to be derated if \nit is required to operate in a high ambient temperature or \ndeliver a large amount of continuous power. The amount \nof current derating is dependent upon the input voltage, \noutput power and ambient temperature.

The thermal coefficients provided on this \npage are based on JESD 51-12 (Guidelines for Reporting \nand Using Electronic Package Thermal Information).\nFor increased accuracy and fidelity to the actual application, \nmany designers use FEA to predict thermal performance. \nTo that end, the Pin Configuration of the data sheet typi-\ncally gives four thermal coefficients: θ\nJA – Thermal resistance from junction to ambient. \nθJCbottom  – Thermal resistance from junction to the bottom  \nof the product case.\nθJCtop – Thermal resistance from junction to top of the \nproduct case.θ\nJB – Thermal resistance from junction to the printed \ncircuit board. While the meaning of each of these coefficients may seem \nto be intuitive, JEDEC has defined each to avoid confusion \nand inconsistency. These definitions are given in JESD \n51-12, and are quoted or paraphrased below:\nθ\nJA is the natural convection junction- to-ambient air \nthermal resistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed \nenclosure. This environment is sometimes referred to as \n“still air” although natural convection causes the air to \nmove. This value is determined with the part mounted to \na JESD 51-9 defined test board, which does not reflect an \nactual application or viable operating condition.θJCbottom  is the thermal resistance between the junction \nand bottom  of the package  with all of the component  power  \ndissipation flowing through the bottom of the package. In \nthe typical µModule converter, the bulk of the heat flows \nout the bottom of the package, but there is always heat \nflow out into the ambient environment. As a result, this \nthermal resistance value may be useful for comparing \npackages but the test conditions don’t generally match \nthe user’s application.\nθJCtop is determined with nearly all of the component power  \ndissipation flowing through the top of the package. As the \nelectrical connections of the typical µModule converter are \non the bottom of the package, it is rare for an application \nto operate such that most of the heat flows from the junc-\ntion to the top of the part. As in the case of θJCbottom , this \nvalue may be useful for comparing packages but the test \nconditions don’t generally match the user’s application.θ\nJB is the junction-to-board thermal resistance where \nalmost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the \nµModule converter and into the board, and is really the \nsum of the θJCbottom  and the thermal resistance of the \nbottom of the part through the solder joints and through a \nportion of the board. The board temperature is measured \na specified distance from the package, using a 2-sided, \n2-layer board. This board is described in JESD 51-9.\nGiven these definitions, it should now be apparent that none  \nof these thermal coefficients reflects an actual physical \noperating condition of a µModule converter. Thus, none \nof them can be individually used to accurately predict the \nthermal performance of the product. Likewise, it would \nbe inappropriate to attempt to use any one coefficient to \ncorrelate to the junction temperature versus load graphs \ngiven in the product’s data sheet. The only appropriate way \nto use the coefficients is when running a detailed thermal \nanalysis, such as FEA, which considers all of the thermal \nresistances simultaneously.\nLTM805620\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM8056A graphical representation of these thermal resistances \nis given in Figure 7.\nThe blue resistances are contained within the µModule \nconverter, and the green are outside.\nThe die temperature of the LTM8056 must be lower than \nthe maximum rating of 125°C, so care should be taken in \nthe layout of the circuit to ensure good heat sinking of the LTM8056. The bulk of the heat flow out of the LTM8056 \nis through the bottom of the μModule converter and the \nBGA pads into the printed circuit board. Consequently a \npoor printed circuit board design can cause excessive \nheating, resulting in impaired performance or reliability. \nPlease refer to the PCB Layout section for printed circuit \nboard design suggestions.\n8056 F07\nµMODULE CONVERTERJUNCTION-TO-CASE (TOP)\nRESISTANCE\nJUNCTION-TO-BOARD RESISTANCEJUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT RESISTANCE (JESD 51-9 DEFINED BOARD)\nCASE (TOP)-TO-AMBIENT\nRESISTANCE\nBOARD-TO-AMBIENT\nRESISTANCEJUNCTION-TO-CASE\n(BOTTOM) RESISTANCEJUNCTION AMBIENT\nCASE (BOTTOM)-TO-BOARD\nRESISTANCE\nFigure 7APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTM805621\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM8056TYPICAL APPLICATIONS\n18V OUT Fan Power from 3V IN to 58V IN with Analog \nCurrent Control and 2A Input Current LimitingMaximum Output Current\nvs CTL Voltage 12V IN\nOutput Voltage vs Output Current 24V OUT from 9V IN to 58V IN with 1.1A Accurate Current Limit VINSVIN\nIIN\nGND LL MODE\nFAN CONTROLL TM8056\nIOUT0.05/uni03A9 VOUT\nCLKOUT\nIINMON\nIOUTMON\nFBRUN\nCOMPSSSYNCCTL\nRT0.022/uni03A9\n6.98k100k\n8056 TA02a22µF\n25V47µF25VV\nOUT\n18V MAX\nFAN\n2.2µF\n100V×31µF\n100V\nV\nIN\n3V TO 58V\n31.6k\nfSW = 650kHz\nDAC+\nVIN\nSVIN\nIIN\nGND LL MODEL TM8056\nIOUT0.05/uni03A9 VOUT\nCLKOUT\nIINMON\nIOUTMON\nFBRUN\nCTLSSSYNCCOMP\nRT\n5.23k\n8056 TA03a22µF\n25V33µF35VV\nOUT\n24V\n2.2µF100V×3V\nIN\n9V TO 58V\n43.2k\nfSW = 525kHz100k\n+CTL VOL TAGE (V)0OUTPUT CURRENT (A)1.2\n0.8\n0.61.0\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n8056 TA02b1.2 0.6 0.8 0.2 0.4 1\nOUTPUT CURRENT (A)0OUTPUT VOL TAGE (V)25\n1520\n10\n5\n0\n8056 TA03b1.5 1 0.512VIN\n24VIN\n36VIN\n48VIN\nLTM805622\n8056fa For more information www.linear .com/L TM805618V OUT from 18V IN to 58V IN with 2.5A Accurate Current Limit \nand Output Current MonitorTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nTw o LTM8056s Paralleled to Get More Output Current.
