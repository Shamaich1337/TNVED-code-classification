The innovative design uses a simple, \nsnap-together concept which eliminates the need for \ncrimping. This connector not only saves the user labor \nand tool cost, but reduces the yield loss due to installa -\ntion error.\nThe xFBR-45xxZ series connectors are available in two \nstyles: latching and non-latching. For a duplex con -\nnector, two non-latching simplex connectors can be \nsnapped together. The connectors are made of a rug -\nged, flame retardant plastic which is good for industrial \nand other harsh environments. The xFBR-45xxZ series \nconnectors are for use with Plastic Optical Fiber only.\nThe xFBR-45xxZ Series of connectors are available in \nthree colors; black, blue and grey.  The ability to select \ncolors to match Transmitters and Receivers makes it \neasier for the User to differentiate between fiber con -\nnections especially when there are a large number.Features\n• Requires No Crimp Ring or Crimping Tool\n• Durable ULTEM® Plastic Material (UL File #E121562)\n• Excellent Retention Force\n• Symmetry in Nonlatching Connector Gives Simplex/\nDuplex Functionality with the Same Part\nApplications\nThese connectors can be used for any application in \nwhich plastic optical fiber is used including:\n• Industrial Control and Voltage Isolation\n• Automotive Networks\n• Proprietary System Interconnects\n• Gaming Equipment\n• Medical Equipment\n• Telecommunications\n• Datacommunications\nULTEM® is a registered trademark of the General Electric Corporation.\n\n2Step 2: Putting on the Connector\nPlace the connector on each end of the fiber, and slide \nthe connector down until the fiber jacket stops it. The \nfiber should protrude no less than 1.5 mm (0.06 in) from \nthe end of the connector.Termination Guide\nStep-by-Step Plastic Cable Connectoring Instructions\nThe following step-by-step guide describes how to \nterminate plastic fiber optic cable. It is ideal for both \nfield and factory installations. Connectors can be easily \ninstalled on cable ends with standard tools such as wire \nstrippers and cutters.\nFinishing the cable is accomplished with the Avago \nTechnologies HFBR-4593Z Polishing Kit, consisting of a \npolishing fixture, 600 grit abrasive paper and 3 mm pink \nlapping film (3M Company, OC3-14). The connector can \nbe used immediately after polishing.\nThe following materials are needed for plastic fiber ter -\nmination:\n1. Plastic optical fiber cable (Example: AFBR-HUD500Z)\n2. Wire cutters or scissors\n3. 16 gauge wire stripper (Example: Ideal Stripmaster \ntype 45-092)\n4. HFBR-4593Z polishing kit (optional)\n5. Crimpless connectors\nStep 1: Stripping the Fiber\nThe zip cord structure of the duplex cable permits easy \nseparation of the channels. The channels should be \nseparated a minimum of 100 mm (4 in) to a maximum \nof 150 mm (6 in) back from the ends to permit connec -\ntoring, polishing and cable end flexibility.\nAfter cutting the cable to the desired length, strip off  \napproximately 7 mm (0.3 in) of the outer jacket with the \n16 gauge wire strippers.\nWhen using the duplex connector arrangement, the \nseparated duplex cable should be stripped to roughly \nequal lengths on each cable end.\nFor the non-latching version (HFBR-4531Z), the same \nconnector is used for simplex and duplex arrangement. \nNo crimping is necessary. The top half of the connector \nwill snap into the ferrule half to secure the fiber.\nTo install  simplex connectors flip the top half of the con -\nnector over and snap it into the ferrule half (with your \nfingers). When the top half latches inside the body of \nthe ferrule half, proper connector-to-cable attachment \nis achieved.\nFor duplex connector installation place one connector \non top of the other, so that the top half of each connec -\ntor is over the ferrule half of the opposite connector.\nManually press connectors together in the center of \nthe arrangement. Then latch by pressing on the sides \nof each connector. As with the simplex version, connec -\ntors are secured when top halves latch into the ferrule \nhalves.\n3\nNote: The four dots on the bottom of the polishing fixture \nare wear indicators. Replace the polishing fixture when \nany dot is no longer visible.\nPress the polishing tool down on the 600 grit abrasive \npaper. Polish the fiber using a figure eight pattern until \nthe connector is flush with the bottom of the polish -\ning fixture. Wipe the connector and fixture with a clean \ncloth or tissue.\nStep 4: Finishing\nPlace the flush connector and polishing fixture on the \ndull side of the 3 µm pink lapping film and continue \nto polish the fiber in the same figure eight pattern for \napproximately 25 strokes. The fiber end should be flat, \nsmooth and clean.\nHFBR-4593Z Polishing Kit\nNote: Use of the pink lapping film fine polishing step \nresults in approximately 2 dB improvement in coupling \nperformance of either a transmitter-receiver link or a bulk -\nhead/splice over a 600 grit polish alone. This fine polish is \ncomparable to the Avago Technologies factory polish. The \nfine polishing step may be omitted for short link lengths.Step 3: Trimming and Polishing\nAny fiber in excess of 1.5 mm (0.06 in) protruding from \nthe connector end should be cut off with wire cutters or \nscissors. \nInsert the connector fully into the polishing fixture \nwith the trimmed fiber protruding from the bottom of \nthe fixture. This plastic polishing fixture can be used to \npolish two simplex connectors simultaneously or one \nduplex connector.\n4Crimpless ConnectorsSimplex\nNon-Latching Latching\nBlack HFBR-4531Z HFBR-4532Z\nBlue HFBR-4533Z NA\nGrey HFBR-4535Z AFBR-4542Z\nHFBR-4531Z/4532Z/4533Z/4535Z, AFBR-4542Z\nAbsolute Maximum Ratings\nParameter Symbol Min Max Units Note\nStorage Temperature TS -40 +85 °C 1\nOperating Temperature TO -40 +85 °C 1\nInstallation Temperature TI 0 +70 °C 1\nConnector Mechanical Characteristics\nParameter Part Number Symbol Min Typ Units Temp°C Note\nRetension force to\nHFBR-0500Z seriesSimplex, Non-latching\nxFBR-45xxZFR-C 8 12 N +25 2\n2.5 N - 40 to +85\nDuplex Configuration,  \nNon-latching xFBR-45xxZFR-C 14 24 N +25 2\n4 N - 40 to +85\nTensile Force,  \nConnector to  CableHFBR-4531Z FT 40 50 N - 40 to +85\nHFBR-4532Z\nAFBR-4542Z\nNote:\n1.
