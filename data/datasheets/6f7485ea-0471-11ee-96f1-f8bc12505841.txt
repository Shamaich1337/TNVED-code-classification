The following procedure is\nrecommended:\nLead Temperature, T L, should be determined from:\nTL = /C0113LA PD + T A\n/C0113LA is the lead-to-ambient thermal resistance and P D is the\npower dissipation.\nJunction Temperature, T J, may be found from:\nTJ = T L + /C0068TJL\n/C0068TJL is the increase in junction temperature above the lead\ntemperature and may be found from Figure 4 for a train ofpower pulses or from Figure 1 for dc power.\n/C0068TJL = /C0113JL PDFor worst-case design, using expected limits of I Z, limits\nof P D and the extremes of T J (/C0068TJ) may be estimated.\nChanges in voltage, V Z, can then be found from:\n/C0068V = /C0113VZ /C0068TJ\n/C0113VZ, the Zener voltage temperature coefficient, is found\nfrom Figures 2 and 3.\nUnder high power -pulse operation, the Zener voltage will\nvary with time and may also be af fected significantly by the\nzener resistance. For best regulation, keep currentexcursions as low as possible.\nData of Figure 4 should not be used to compute surge\ncapability. Surge limitations are given in Figure 5. They are\nlower than would be expected by considering only junction\ntemperature, as current crowding ef fects cause temperatures\nto be extremely high in small spots resulting in devicedegradation should the limits of Figure 5 be exceeded.\nSURMETIC 40, AXIAL LEAD\nCASE 017AA−01\nISSUE O\nDATE 23 SEP 2005\nSCALE 1:1B\nD\nF\nKAFKDIM MIN MAX MIN MAXMILLIMETERS INCHES\nA 0.330 0.350 8.38 8.89\nB 0.130 0.145 3.30 3.68\nD 0.037 0.043 0.94 1.09\nF −−− 0.050 −−− 1.27\nK 1.000 1.250 25.40 31.75NOTES:\n1.
