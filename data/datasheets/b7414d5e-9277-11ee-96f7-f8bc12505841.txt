It is available in a 24-lead, 0.3" wide, plastic or hermetic\nDIP or in a 24-lead SOIC.\nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1. The AD7892-3 features a conversion time of 1.47 µs and a\ntrack/hold acquisition time of 200 ns.  This allows a through-\nput rate for the part up to 600 kSPS. The AD7892-1 and\nAD7892-2 operate with throughput rates of 500 kSPS.\n2. The AD7892 operates from a single +5 V supply and con-\nsumes 60 mW typ making it ideal for low power and portable\napplications.\n3. The part offers a high speed, flexible interface arrangement\nwith parallel and serial interfaces for easy connection tomicroprocessors, microcontrollers and digital signal\nprocessors.GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe AD7892 is a high speed, low power, 12-bit A/D converter\nthat operates from a single +5 V supply.  The part contains a1.47 µs successive approximation ADC, an on-chip track/hold\namplifier, an internal +2.5 V reference and on-chip versatile\ninterface structures that allow both serial and parallel connec-tion to a microprocessor. The part accepts an analog input range\nof ±10 V or ±5 V (AD7892-1), 0 V to +2.5 V (AD7892-2) and\n±2.5 V (AD7892-3). Overvoltage protection on the analog inputs\nfor the AD7892-1 and AD7892-3 allows the input voltage to go\nto ±17 V or ±7 V respectively without damaging the ports.\nThe AD7892 offers a choice of two data output formats: a\nsingle, parallel, 12-bit word or serial data. Fast bus access timesand standard control inputs ensure easy parallel interface to\nmicroprocessors and digital signal processors.  A high speed\nserial interface allows direct connection to the serial ports ofmicrocontrollers and digital signal processors.\nIn addition to the traditional dc accuracy specifications such as\nlinearity, full-scale and offset errors, the part is also specified for\ndynamic performance parameters including harmonic distortionand signal-to-noise ratio.\nREV.

All input signals are measured with tr = tf = 1 ns (10% to 90% of +5 V) and timed from a voltage level of +1.6 V.\n2See Figures 2 and 3.\n3Measured with the load circuit of Figure 1 and defined as the time required for an output to cross 0.8 V or 2.4 V.\n4These times are derived from the measured time taken by the data outputs to change 0.5 V when loaded with the circuit of Figure 1. The measured number is then\nextrapolated back to remove the effects of charging or discharging the 50 pF capacitor. This means that the times quoted in the  timing characteristics are the true bus\nrelinquish times of the part and as such are independent of external bus loading capacitances.\n5Assumes CMOS loads on the data bits.

With this input at a logic high, the part is in its normal operating\nmode; with this input at a logic low, the part is placed in its standby or power-down mode, which\nreduces power consumption to 5 mW typical.\n3V IN2 Analog Input 2. For the AD7892-1, this input either connects to AGND or to V IN1 to determine\nthe analog input voltage range. With V IN2 connected to AGND on the AD7892-1, the analog input\nrange at the V IN1 input is ±10 V. With V IN2 connected to V IN1 on the AD7892-1, the analog input\nrange to the part is ±5V .\nFor the AD7892-2 and AD7892-3, this input can be left unconnected but must not be connected\nto a potential other than AGND.\n4V IN1 Analog Input 1. The analog input voltage to be converted by the AD7892 is applied to this input.\nFor the AD7892-1, the input voltage range is either ±5 V or ±10 V depending on where the V IN2\ninput is connected. For the AD7892-2, the voltage range on the V IN1 input is 0 V to +2.5 V with\nrespect to the voltage appearing at the V IN2 input. For the AD7892-3, the voltage range on the V IN1\ninput is ±2.5 V.\n5 REF OUT/REF IN Voltage Reference Output/Input. The part can be used with either its own internal reference or with\nan external reference source. The on-chip +2.5 V reference is provided at this pin. When using this\ninternal reference as the reference source for the part, REF OUT should be decoupled to AGNDwith a 0.1 µF disc ceramic capacitor. The output impedance of this reference source is typically\n5.5 k Ω. When using an external reference source as the reference voltage for the part, the reference\nsource should be connected to this pin.

It also applies to situations where there\nis a step input change on the input voltage applied to the V\nIN\ninput of the AD7892.  It means that the user must wait for the\nduration of the track/hold acquisition time after the end of con-\nversion or after a step input change to V IN before starting another\nconversion, to ensure that the part operates to specification.TERMINOLOGY\nSignal to (Noise + Distortion) Ratio\nThis is the measured ratio of signal to (noise + distortion) at the\noutput of the A/D converter.  The signal is the rms amplitude of\nthe fundamental.  Noise is the rms sum of all nonfundamentalsignals up to half the sampling frequency (f\nS/2), excluding dc.\nThe ratio is dependent upon the number of quantization levels\nin the digitization process; the more levels, the smaller the quan-tization noise.  The theoretical signal to (noise + distortion)\nratio for an ideal N-bit converter with a sine wave input is given\nby:\nSignal to (Noise + Distortion ) = (6.02  N + 1.76)  dB\nThus for a 12-bit converter, this is 74 dB.\nTotal Harmonic Distortion\nTotal harmonic distortion (THD) is the ratio of the rms sum of\nharmonics to the fundamental.  For the AD7892, it is defined\nas:\n    THD (dB)=20 logV22+V32+V42+V52+V62\nV1\nwhere V1 is the rms amplitude of the fundamental and V2, V3,\nV4, V5 and V6 are the rms amplitudes of the second through the\nsixth harmonics.\nPeak Harmonic or Spurious Noise\nPeak harmonic or spurious noise is defined as the ratio of therms value of the next largest component in the ADC outputspectrum (up to f\nS/2 and excluding dc) to the rms value of the\nfundamental.  Normally, the value of this specification is deter-\nmined by the largest harmonic in the spectrum, but for partswhere the harmonics are buried in the noise floor, it will be a\nnoise peak.\nIntermodulation Distortion\nWith inputs consisting of sine waves at two frequencies, fa and\nfb, any active device with nonlinearities will create distortion\nproducts at sum and difference frequencies of mfa ± nfb where\nm, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  Intermodulation terms are those for\nwhich neither m nor n are equal to zero.  For example, the sec-\nond order terms include (fa + fb) and (fa – fb), while the third\norder terms include (2fa + fb), (2fa – fb), (fa + 2fb) and(fa – 2fb).\nThe AD7892 is tested using two input frequencies away from\nthe bottom end of the input bandwidth.  In this case, the second\nand third order terms are of different significance.  The secondorder terms are usually distanced in frequency from the original\nsine waves while the third order terms are usually at a frequency\nclose to the input frequencies.  As a result, the second and thirdorder terms are specified separately.  The calculation of the\nintermodulation distortion is as per the THD specification where it\nis the ratio of the rms sum of the individual distortion products tothe rms amplitude of the fundamental expressed in dBs.\nAD7892\nREV. C –9–CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION\nThe AD7892 is a fast, 12-bit single supply A/D converter. It\nprovides the user with signal scaling, track/hold, reference, A/D\nconverter and versatile interface logic functions on a single chip.The signal scaling on the AD7892-1 allows the part to handle\neither ±5 V or ±10 V input signals while operating from a single\n+5 V supply.  The AD7892-2 handles a 0 V to +2.5 V analoginput range, while signal scaling on the AD7892-3 allows it to\nhandle ±2.5 V input signals when operating from a single supply.\nThe part requires a +2.5 V reference which can be provided from\nthe part’s own internal reference or from an external reference\nsource.\nConversion is initiated on the AD7892 by pulsing the CONVST\ninput.  On the rising edge of CONVST , the track/hold goes\nfrom track mode to hold mode and the conversion sequence is\nstarted. At the end of conversion (falling edge of EOC ), the\ntrack/hold returns to tracking mode and the acquisition timebegins. Conversion time for the part is 1.47 µs (AD7892-3) and\nthe track/hold acquisition time is 200 ns (AD7892-3). This allows\nthe AD7892-3 to operate at throughput rates up to 600 kSPS.The AD7892-1 and AD7892-2 are specified with a 1.6 µs con-\nversion and 400 ns acquisition time allowing a throughput rate\nof 500 kSPS.\nTrack/Hold Section\nThe track/hold amplifier on the AD7892 allows the ADC to\naccurately convert an input sine wave of full-scale amplitude to\n12-bit accuracy. The input bandwidth of the track/hold is greaterthan the Nyquist rate of the ADC even when the ADC is oper-\nated at its maximum throughput rate of 600 kHz (i.e., the track/\nhold can handle input frequencies in excess of 300 kHz).\nThe track/hold amplifier acquires an input signal to 12-bit accu-\nracy in less than 200 ns.  The operation of the track/hold is\nessenti ally transparent to the user.  The track/hold amplifier\ngoes from its tracking mode to its hold mode on the rising edgeof CONVST .  The aperture time for the track/hold (i.e., the\ndelay time between the external CONVST  signal and the track/\nhold actually going into hold) is typically 15 ns.  At the end ofconversion, the part returns to its tracking mode.  The acquisi-\ntion time of the track/hold amplifier begins at this point.\nReference Section\nThe AD7892 contains a single reference pin, labelled REF OUT/\nREF IN, which either provides access to the part’s own +2.5 V\nreference or to which an external +2.5 V reference can be con-\nnected to provide the reference source for the part. The part isspecified with a +2.5 V reference voltage.  Errors in the refer-\nence source will result in gain errors in the AD7892’s transfer\nfunction and will add to the specified full-scale errors on the\npart.  On the AD7892-1 and AD7892-3, it will also result in anoffset error injected in the attenuator stage.\nThe AD7892 contains an on-chip +2.5 V reference. To use this\nreference as the reference source for the AD7892, simply con-\nnect a 0.1 µF disc ceramic capacitor from the REF OUT/\nREF IN pin to AGND. The voltage that appears at this pin is\ninternally buffered before being applied to the ADC. If this\nreference is required for use external to the AD7892, it shouldbe buffered as the part has a FET switch in series with the refer-\nence output resulting in a source impedance for this output of\n5.5 k Ω nominal. The tolerance on the internal reference is\n±10 mV at 25 °C with a typical temperature coefficient of\n25 ppm/ °C and a maximum error over temperature of ±25 mV.\nIf the application requires a reference with a tighter tolerance or\nthe AD7892 needs to be used with a system reference, then theuser has the option of connecting an external reference to this\nREF OUT/REF IN pin. The external reference will effectively\noverdrive the internal reference and thus provide the referencesource for the ADC. The reference input is buffered before\nbeing applied to the ADC with the maximum input current is\n±100µA. Suitable reference sources for the AD7892 include the\nAD680, AD780 and REF43 precision +2.5 V references.\nINTERFACING\nThe part provides two interface options, a 12-bit parallel inter-\nface and a three-wire serial interface.  The required interface\nmode is selected via the MODE pin.  The two interface modesare discussed in the following sections.\nParallel Interface Mode\nThe parallel interface mode is selected by tying the MODEinput to a logic high.  Figure 2 shows a timing diagram illustrat-\ning the operational sequence of the AD7892.  The on-chip\ntrack/hold goes into hold mode, and conversion is initiated on\nthe rising edge of the CONVST  signal.  When conversion is\ncomplete, the end of conversion line ( EOC ) pulses low to indi-\ncate that new data is available in the AD7892’s output register.\nThis EOC  line can be used to drive an edge-triggered interrupt\nof a microprocessor.  The falling edge of the RD signal should\noccur 200 ns prior to the next rising edge of CONVST .  CS and\nRD going low accesses the 12-bit conversion result.

Parallel Mode Timing Diagram\nAD7892\n–10– REV. Cpulse can be applied to the CS and RD inputs to latch data out\nof the AD7892 and into the gate array or ASIC.  This eliminatesthe logic required in the gate array or ASIC to recognize the end\nof conversion and generate the read signal for the AD7892. To\nobtain optimum performance from the AD7892, it is not recom-mended to tie CS and RD permanently low as this keeps the\nthree-state active during conversion.\nSerial Interface Mode\nThe AD7892 is configured for serial mode interfacing by tying\nthe MODE input low.  It provides for a three-wire, serial link\nbetween the AD7892 and industry-standard microprocessors,\nmicrocontrollers and digital signal processors.  SCLK and RFS\nof the AD7892 are inputs, and the AD7892’s serial interface is\ndesigned for direct interface to systems that provide a serial\nclock input that is synchronized to the serial data output includ-ing microcontrollers such as the 80C51, 87C51, 68HC11 and\n68HC05 and most digital signal processors.\nFigure 3 shows the timing diagram for reading from the AD 7892\nin the serial interface mode.  RFS goes low to access data from\nthe AD7892.  The serial clock input does not have to be con-\ntinuous.  The serial data can be accessed in a number of bytes.\nHowever, RFS must remain low for the duration of the data\ntransfer operation.  Sixteen bits of data are transmitted with four\nleading zeros followed by the 12-bit conversion result starting\nwith the MSB.  Serial data is clocked out of the device on therising edge of SCLK.  Old data is guaranteed to be valid for 5 ns\nafter this edge. This is useful for high speed serial clocks where\nthe access time of the part would not allow sufficient set-up timefor the data to be accepted on the falling edge of the clock. In\nthis case, care must be taken that RFS does not go just prior to\na rising edge of SCLK. For slower serial clocks data is valid onthe falling edge of SCLK.  At the end of the read operation, the\nSDATA line is three-stated by a rising edge on either the SCLK\nor RFS inputs, whichever occurs first.  Serial data cannot be\nread during conversion to avoid feedthrough problems from the\nserial clock to the conversion process.  For optimum perfor-\nmance of the AD7892-3, a serial read should also be avoidedwithin 200 ns of the rising edge of CONVST  to avoid feedthrough\ninto the track/hold during its acquisition time.  The serial read\nshould, therefore, occur between the end of conversion ( EOC\nfalling edge) and 200 ns prior to the next rising edge ofCONVST .  For the AD7892-1 and AD7892-2, a serial read\nshould also be avoided within 400 ns of the rising edge ofCONVST .  This limits the maximum achievable throughput\nrate in serial mode (assuming 20 MHz serial clock) to 400 kSPS\nfor the AD7892-3 and 357 kSPS for the AD7892-1 andAD7892-2.\nAnalog Input Section\nThe AD7892 is offered as three part types allowing for fourdifferent analog input voltage ranges. The AD7892-1 handleseither ±5 V or ±10 V input voltage ranges. The AD7892-2\nhandles a 0 V to +2.5 V input voltage range while the AD7892-3\nhandles an input range of ±2.5 V.\nAD7892-1\nFigure 4 shows the analog input section for the AD7892-1.  The\nanalog input range is pin-strappable (using V IN2) for either ±5V\nor ±10 V on the V IN1 input. With V IN2 connected to AGND, the\ninput range on V IN1 is ±10 V, and the input resistance on V IN1 is\n15 kΩ nominal. With V IN2 connected to V IN1, the input range on\nVIN1 is ±5 V, and the input resistance on V IN1 is 8 k Ω nominal.\nAs a result, the V IN1 and V IN2 inputs should be driven from a\nlow impedance source. The resistor attenuator stage is followed\nby the high input impedance stage of the track/hold amplifier.This resistor attenuator stage allows the input voltage to go to\n±17 V without damaging the AD7892-1.\n+2.5\nREFERENCE\nREF OUT/\nREF IN\nVIN1\nVIN2\nAGNDTO HIGH\nIMPEDANCESHA INPUTTO ADC\nREFERENCECIRCUITRY2k/H9024\n3.25k/H9024\n13k/H9024\n6.5k/H902413k/H9024\nFigure 4.

CMICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING\nThe AD7892 features both high speed parallel and serial inter-\nfaces, allowing considerable flexibility in interfacing to micro-\nprocessor systems. To obtain optimum performance from the\npart, data should not be read during conversion and this limitsthe achievable throughput rate in serial mode to 400 kSPS for\nthe AD7892-3.\nFigures 6, 7 and 9 show some typical interface circuits between\nthe AD7892 and popular DSP processors.

For opti-\nmum performance from the part, it is recommended that this\n+5 V is taken from the +5 V analog supply in the system. Theanalog and digital grounds to the AD7892 are independent and\nseparately pinned out to minimize coupling between the analog\nand digital sections of the device.  The part exhibits good immu-nity to noise on the supplies but care must still be taken with\nregard to grounding and layout especially when using switching\nmode supplies.\nThe printed circuit board which houses the AD7892 should be\ndesigned such that the analog and digital sections are separated\nand confined to certain areas of the board. This facilitates the\nuse of ground planes which can be separated easily. A minimumetch technique is generally best for ground planes as it gives the\nbest shielding. Digital and analog ground planes should only be\njoined in one place. If the AD7892 is the only device requiringan AGND to DGND connection, then the ground planes\nshould be connected at the AGND and DGND pins of the\nAD7892. If the AD7892 is in a system where multiple devicesrequire AGND to DGND connections, the connection should\nstill be made at one point only, a star ground point which\nshould be established as close as possible to the AD7892.\nAvoid running digital lines under the device as these will couple\nnoise onto the die. The analog ground plane should be allowed\nto run under the AD7892 to avoid noise coupling. The power\nsupply lines to the AD7892 should use as large a trace as pos-sible to provide low impedance paths and reduce the effects of\nglitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals like\nclocks should be shielded with digital ground to avoid radiatingnoise to other sections of the board and clock signals should\nnever be run near the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital\nand analog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the board shouldrun at right angles to each other. This will reduce the effects of\nfeedthrough through the board. A microstrip technique is by far\nthe best but is not always possible with a double-sided board. Inthis technique, the component side of the board is dedicated to\nground planes while signals are placed on the solder side.Good decoupling is important when using high resolution ADCs.\nAll analog supplies should be decoupled with 10 µF tantalum in\nparallel with 0.1 µF capacitors to AGND. To achieve the best\nfrom these decoupling components, they have to be placed as\nclose as possible to the device, ideally right up against the device.\nAll logic chips should be decoupled with 0.1 µF disc ceramic\ncapacitors to DGND. It is recommended that the system’s\nAV\nDD supply is used to supply the V DD for the AD7892. This\nsupply should have the recommended analog supply decouplingcapacitors between the V\nDD pin of the AD7892 and AGND and\nthe recommended digital supply decoupling capacitor between\nthe V DD pin of the AD7892 and DGND.\nEvaluating the AD7892 Performance\nThe recommended layout for the AD7892 is outlined in the\nevaluation board for the AD7892. The evaluation board package\nincludes a fully assembled and tested evaluation board, docu-mentation and software for controlling the board from a PC\nusing the EVAL-CONTROL BOARD. The EVAL-CONTROL\nBOARD can be used in conjunction with the AD7892 evalua-tion board, as well as many other Analog Devices evaluation\nboards ending in the CB designator. Using the EVAL-CONTROL\nBOARD with the AD7892 evaluation board allows the user toevaluate the ac and dc performance of the AD7892 on a PC.\nThe software provided with the evaluation board allows the user\nto perform ac (Fast Fourier Transform) and dc (histogram of\ncodes) tests on the AD7892. The evaluation board can alsobe used in a stand-alone fashion without the EVAL-CONTROL\nBOARD but in this case, the user has to write their own software\nto evaluate the part. There are two versions of the evaluationboard available, one for the AD7892-2 and one for the AD7892-3.\nTo order the AD7892-2 evaluation board, the order number is\nEVAL-AD7892-2CB and to order the AD7892-3 evaluationboard, the order number is EVAL-AD7892-3CB.\nAD7892\n–14– REV.
