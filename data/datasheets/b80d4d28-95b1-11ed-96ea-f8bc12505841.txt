In particular, it is possible for washing varnish agent residues to have a\nnegative effect in the long-term on wire insulation.\nWashing processesmay damage the product due to the possible static or cyclic mechanical\nloads (e.g. ultrasonic cleaning). They may cause cracks to developon the product and its parts,\nwhich might lead to reduced reliability or lifetime.\nThe following points must be observed if the components are potted in customer applications:\n– Many potting materials shrink as they harden. They therefore exert a pressure on the plastic\nhousing or core. This pressure can have a deleterious effect on electrical properties, and in\nextreme cases can damage the core or plastic housing mechanically.\n– It is necessary to check whether the potting material used attacks or destroys the wire\ninsulation, plastics or glue.\n– The effect of the potting material can change the high-frequency behaviour of the\ncomponents.\nFerrites are sensitive to direct impact. This can cause the core material to flake, or lead to\nbreakage of the core.\nEven for customer-specific products, conclusive validation of the component in the circuit can\nonly be carried out by the customer.\nDisplay of ordering codes for EPCOS products\nThe ordering code for one and the same product can be represented differently in data sheets,\ndata books, other publications and the website of EPCOS, or in order-related documents such as\nshipping notes, order confirmations and product labels. The varying representations of the\nordering codes are due to different processes employed and do not affect the specifications of the\nrespective products.

These statements are based on our knowledge of typical\nrequirements that are often placed on our products in the areas  of application concerned. We\nnevertheless expressly point out that such statements cannot be regarded as binding\nstatements about the suitability of our products for a particular customer application.

In customer applications requiring a very high\nlevel of operational safety and especially in customer applicat ions in which the malfunction or\nfailure of an electronic component could endanger human life or  health (e.g. in accident\nprevention or life-saving systems), it must therefore be ensure d by means of suitable design of the\ncustomer application or other action taken by the customer (e.g. installation of protective circuitry\nor redundancy) that no injury or damage is sustained by third p arties in the event of malfunction or\nfailure of an electronic component.\n3.The warnings, cautions and product-specific notes must be obser ved.\n4.
