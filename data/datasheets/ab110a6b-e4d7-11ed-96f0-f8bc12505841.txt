The antenna\nelement provides 67MHz ofsignal bandwidth supporting the entire upper GNSS band and L-Band\ncorrections (1539 -1606 MHz) and 91MHz ofthe lower band signal bandwidth (1164 -1255 MHz). The other\nkey component ofthe antenna isthe axial ratio, which isameasure ofhow well the antenna captures the\nbroadcast Right Hand Circular Polarized (RHCP) signal and mitigates the reflected LHCP signals. The\nTallysman HC997EXF has ahigh peak gain of2.5 dBi and 0.5 dBaxial ratio atzenith, enabling excellent\nmultipath mitigation and a very precise phase centre.\nWeighing only 11g,the light and compact HC997EXF features aprecision-tuned helix element that provides\nexcellent axial ratios and operates without the requirement ofaground plane, making itideal forawide\nvariety of applications, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\nThe HC997EXF features an industry-leading low current, low-noise amplifier (LNA) that includes an\nintegrated low-loss pre-filter toprevent harmonic interference from high-amplitude signals, such as700\nMHz band LTE and other near-band cellular signals. Asthe radio frequency spectrum has become more\ncongested, the signals orharmonic frequencies ofnew LTE bands [e.g. 800MHz x2=1600MHz (GLONASS-\nG1)] can affect GNSS antennas and receivers. InNorth America, planned Ligado signals at1525 -1536 MHz\ncan especially impact GNSS antennas that support space-based L-band correction services (1539 -1559\nMHz). New LTE signals inEurope [Band 32(1452 -1496 MHz)] and Japan [Bands 11and 21(1476–1511\nMHz)] have also been observed to interfere with GNSS signals. Inaddition, Inmarsat satellite\ncommunication (uplink: 1626.5 -1660.5 MHz) can also affect GNSS signals. The new Tallysman XFantennas\nhave been designed tomitigate out-of-band signals and prevent GNSS antenna saturation. Tallysman’s\ncustom XFfiltering mitigates allexisting signals and new Ligado and LTE signals, enabling the antennas and\nattached GNSS receivers to perform optimally.\nThe HC997EXF must beinstalled carefully, asground planes below the antenna can affect itstuning.
