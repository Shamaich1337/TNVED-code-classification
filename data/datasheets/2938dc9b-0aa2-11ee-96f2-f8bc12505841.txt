System Overview\n3.1  Introduction\nThe EFR32 product family combines an energy-friendly MCU with a high performance radio transceiver. The devices are well suited for\nsecure connected IoT multiprotocol devices requiring high performance and low energy consumption. This section gives a short intro-\nduction to the full radio and MCU system. The detailed functional description can be found in the EFR32xG21 Reference Manual.\nA block diagram of the EFR32MG21  family is shown in Figure 3.1 Detailed EFR32MG21  Block Diagram on page 6.

Detailed EFR32MG21 Block Diagram\n3.2  Radio\nThe EFR32MG21 Mighty Gecko features a highly configurable radio transceiver supporting Zigbee, Thread, and Bluetooth Low Energy\nwireless protocols.\n3.2.1  Antenna Interface\nThe 2.4 GHz antenna interface consists of two single-ended pins (RF2G4_IO1 and RF2G4_IO2) that interface directly to two LNAs and\ntwo 10 dBm PAs. For devices that support 20 dBm, these pins also interface to the 20 dBm on-chip balun. Integrated switches select\neither RF2G4_IO1 or RF2G4_IO2 to be the active path.\nThe external components and power supply connections for the antenna interface typical applications are shown in the RF Matching\nNetworks section.EFR32MG21 Mighty Gecko Multiprotocol Wireless SoC Family Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.1  |  6\n3.2.2  Fractional-N Frequency Synthesizer\nThe EFR32MG21 contains a high performance, low phase noise, fully integrated fractional-N frequency synthesizer. The synthesizer is\nused in receive mode to generate the LO frequency for the down-conversion mixer. It is also used in transmit mode to directly generate\nthe modulated RF carrier.\nThe fractional-N architecture provides excellent phase noise performance, frequency resolution better than 100 Hz, and low energy\nconsumption. The synthesizer’s fast frequency settling allows for very short receiver and transmitter wake up times to reduce system\nenergy consumption.\n3.2.3  Receiver Architecture\nThe EFR32MG21  uses a low-IF receiver architecture, consisting of a Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) followed by an I/Q down-conversion\nmixer. The I/Q signals are further filtered and amplified before being sampled by the IF analog-to-digital converter (IFADC).\nThe IF frequency is configurable from 150 kHz to 1371 kHz. The IF can further be configured for high-side or low-side injection, provid-\ning flexibility with respect to known interferers at the image frequency.\nThe Automatic Gain Control (AGC) module adjusts the receiver gain to optimize performance and avoid saturation for excellent selec-\ntivity and blocking performance. The 2.4 GHz radio is calibrated at production to improve image rejection performance.\nDemodulation is performed in the digital domain. The demodulator performs configurable decimation and channel filtering to allow re-\nceive bandwidths ranging from 0.1 to 2530 kHz. High carrier frequency and baud rate offsets are tolerated by active estimation and\ncompensation. Advanced features supporting high quality communication under adverse conditions include forward error correction by\nblock and convolutional coding as well as Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS).\nA Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is available for signal quality metrics, for level-based proximity detection, and for RF chan-\nnel access by Collision Avoidance (CA) or Listen Before Talk (LBT) algorithms. An RSSI capture value is associated with each received\nframe and the dynamic RSSI measurement can be monitored throughout reception.\n3.2.4  Transmitter Architecture\nThe EFR32MG21  uses a direct-conversion transmitter architecture. For constant envelope modulation formats, the modulator controls\nphase and frequency modulation in the frequency synthesizer. Transmit symbols or chips are optionally shaped by a digital shaping\nfilter. The shaping filter is fully configurable, including the BT product, and can be used to implement Gaussian or Raised Cosine shap-\ning.\nCarrier Sense Multiple Access - Collision Avoidance (CSMA-CA) or Listen Before Talk (LBT) algorithms can be automatically timed by\nthe EFR32MG21 . These algorithms are typically defined by regulatory standards to improve inter-operability in a given bandwidth be-\ntween devices that otherwise lack synchronized RF channel access.\n3.2.5  Packet and State Trace\nThe EFR32MG21 Frame Controller has a packet and state trace unit that provides valuable information during the development phase.\nIt features:\n• Non-intrusive trace of transmit data, receive data and state information\n• Data observability on a single-pin UART data output, or on a two-pin SPI data output\n• Configurable data output bitrate / baudrate\n• Multiplexed transmitted data, received data and state / meta information in a single serial data stream\n3.2.6  Data Buffering\nThe EFR32MG21  features an advanced Radio Buffer Controller (BUFC) capable of handling up to 4 buffers of adjustable size from 64\nbytes to 4096 bytes. Each buffer can be used for RX, TX or both. The buffer data is located in RAM, enabling zero-copy operations.\n3.2.7  Radio Controller (RAC)\nThe Radio Controller controls the top level state of the radio subsystem in the EFR32MG21. It performs the following tasks:\n• Precisely-timed control of enabling and disabling of the receiver and transmitter circuitry\n• Run-time calibration of receiver, transmitter and frequency synthesizer\n• Detailed frame transmission timing, including optional LBT or CSMA-CAEFR32MG21 Mighty Gecko Multiprotocol Wireless SoC Family Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.1  |  7\n3.3  General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)\nEFR32MG21  has up to 20 General Purpose Input/Output pins. Each GPIO pin can be individually configured as either an output or\ninput. More advanced configurations including open-drain, open-source, and glitch-filtering can be configured for each individual GPIO\npin. The GPIO pins can be overridden by peripheral connections, like SPI communication. Each peripheral connection can be routed to\nseveral GPIO pins on the device. The input value of a GPIO pin can be routed through the Peripheral Reflex System to other peripher-\nals. The GPIO subsystem supports asynchronous external pin interrupts.\nAll of the pins on ports A and port B are EM2 capable. These pins may be used by Low-Energy peripherals in EM2/3 and may also be\nused as EM2/3 pin wake-ups. Pins on ports C and D are latched/retained in their current state when entering EM2 until EM2 exit upon\nwhich internal peripherals could once again drive those pads.\nA few GPIOs also have EM4 wake functionality. These pins are listed in 6.2 Alternate Function Table .\n3.4  Clocking\n3.4.1  Clock Management Unit (CMU)\nThe Clock Management Unit controls oscillators and clocks in the EFR32MG21. Individual enabling and disabling of clocks to all periph-\neral modules is performed by the CMU. The CMU also controls enabling and configuration of the oscillators. A high degree of flexibility\nallows software to optimize energy consumption in any specific application by minimizing power dissipation in unused peripherals and\noscillators.\n3.4.2  Internal and External Oscillators\nThe EFR32MG21 supports two crystal oscillators and fully integrates five RC oscillators, listed below.\n•A high frequency crystal oscillator (HFXO) with integrated load capacitors, tunable in small steps, provides a precise timing refer-\nence for the MCU and RF synthesizer. The HFXO provides excellent RF clocking performance using a 38.4 MHz crystal. The HFXO\ncan also support an external clock source such as a TCXO for applications that require an extremely accurate clock frequency over\ntemperature.\n• A 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator (LFXO) provides an accurate timing reference for low energy modes.\n•An integrated high frequency RC oscillator (HFRCO) is available for the MCU system, when crystal accuracy is not required. The\nHFRCO employs fast start-up at minimal energy consumption combined with a wide frequency range, from 1 MHz to 80 MHz.\n•An integrated high frequency RC oscillator (HFRCOEM2) runs down to EM2 and is available for timing the general-purpose ADC\nand the Serial Wire Viewer port with a wide frequency range.\n• An integrated fast start-up RC oscillator (FSRCO) that runs at a fixed 20 MHz\n• An integrated low frequency 32.768 kHz RC oscillator (LFRCO) for low power operation where high accuracy is not required.\n•An integrated ultra-low frequency 1 kHz RC oscillator (ULFRCO) is available to provide a timing reference at the lowest energy con-\nsumption in low energy modes.\n3.5  Counters/Timers and PWM\n3.5.1  Timer/Counter (TIMER)\nTIMER peripherals keep track of timing, count events, generate PWM outputs and trigger timed actions in other peripherals through the\nPeripheral Reflex System (PRS). The core of each TIMER is a 16-bit or 32-bit counter with up to 3 compare/capture channels. Each\nchannel is configurable in one of three modes. In capture mode, the counter state is stored in a buffer at a selected input event. In\ncompare mode, the channel output reflects the comparison of the counter to a programmed threshold value. In PWM mode, the TIMER\nsupports generation of pulse-width modulation (PWM) outputs of arbitrary waveforms defined by the sequence of values written to the\ncompare registers. In addition some timers offer dead-time insertion.\nSee 3.12 Configuration Summary  for information on the feature set of each timer.\n3.5.2  Low Energy Timer (LETIMER)\nThe unique LETIMER is a 24-bit timer that is available in energy mode EM2 Deep Sleep in addition to EM1 Sleep and EM0 Active. This\nallows it to be used for timing and output generation when most of the device is powered down, allowing simple tasks to be performed\nwhile the power consumption of the system is kept at an absolute minimum. The LETIMER can be used to output a variety of wave-\nforms with minimal software intervention. The LETIMER is connected to the Peripheral Reflex System (PRS), and can be configured to\nstart counting on compare matches from other peripherals such as the RTCC.EFR32MG21 Mighty Gecko Multiprotocol Wireless SoC Family Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.1  |  8\n3.5.3  Real Time Clock with Capture (RTCC)\nThe Real Time Clock with Capture (RTCC) is a 32-bit counter providing timekeeping down to EM3. The RTCC can be clocked by any of\nthe on-board low-frequency oscillators, and it is capable of providing system wake-up at user defined intervals.\nA secondary RTC is used by the RF protocol stack for event scheduling, leaving the primary RTCC block available exclusively for appli-\ncation software.\n3.5.4  Back-Up Real Time Counter\nThe Back-Up Real Time Counter (BURTC) is a 32-bit counter providing timekeeping in all energy modes, including EM4. The BURTC\ncan be clocked by any of the on-board low-frequency oscillators, and it is capable of providing system wake-up at user defined inver-\nvals.\n3.5.5  Watchdog Timer (WDOG)\nThe watchdog timer can act both as an independent watchdog or as a watchdog synchronous with the CPU clock. It has windowed\nmonitoring capabilities, and can generate a reset or different interrupts depending on the failure mode of the system. The watchdog can\nalso monitor autonomous systems driven by the Peripheral Reflex System (PRS).\n3.6  Communications and Other Digital Peripherals\n3.6.1  Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (USART)\nThe Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter is a flexible serial I/O module. It supports full duplex asynchronous\nUART communication with hardware flow control as well as RS-485, SPI, MicroWire and 3-wire. It can also interface with devices sup-\nporting:\n• ISO7816 SmartCards\n• IrDA\n•I2S\n3.6.2  Inter-Integrated Circuit Interface (I2C)\nThe I2C module provides an interface between the MCU and a serial I2C bus. It is capable of acting as both a master and a slave and\nsupports multi-master buses. Standard-mode, fast-mode and fast-mode plus speeds are supported, allowing transmission rates from 10\nkbit/s up to 1 Mbit/s. Slave arbitration and timeouts are also available, allowing implementation of an SMBus-compliant system. The\ninterface provided to software by the I2C module allows precise timing control of the transmission process and highly automated trans-\nfers. Automatic recognition of slave addresses is provided in active and low energy modes. Note that not all instances of I2C are avalia-\nble in all energy modes.\n3.6.3  Peripheral Reflex System (PRS)\nThe Peripheral Reflex System provides a communication network between different peripheral modules without software involvement.\nPeripheral modules producing Reflex signals are called producers. The PRS routes Reflex signals from producers to consumer periph-\nerals which in turn perform actions in response. Edge triggers and other functionality such as simple logic operations (AND, OR, NOT)\ncan be applied by the PRS to the signals. The PRS allows peripherals to act autonomously without waking the MCU core, saving pow-\ner.\n3.7  Security Features\nA dedicated security CPU enables the Secure Element function. It isolates cryptographic functions and data from the host Cortex-M33\ncore and provides the following security features:\n• Secure Boot with Root of Trust and Secure Loader (RTSL)\n• Cryptographic Accelerator\n• True Random Number Generator (TRNG)\n• Secure Debug with Lock/UnlockEFR32MG21 Mighty Gecko Multiprotocol Wireless SoC Family Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.1  |  9\n3.7.1  Secure Boot with Root of Trust and Secure Loader (RTSL)\nThe Secure Boot with RTSL authenticates a chain of trusted firmware that begins from an immutable memory (ROM).\nIt prevents malware injection, prevents rollback, ensures that only authentic firmware is executed and protects Over The Air updates.\nMore information on this feature can be found in the Application Note AN1218: Series 2 Secure Boot with RTSL .\n3.7.2  Cryptographic Accelerator\nThe Cryptographic Accelerator is an autonomous hardware accelerator with Differential Power Analysis (DPA) countermeasures to pro-\ntect keys.\nIt supports AES encryption and decryption with 128/192/256-bit keys, Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC) to support public key opera-\ntions and hashes.\nSupported block cipher modes of operation for AES include:\n• ECB (Electronic Code Book)\n• CTR (Counter Mode)\n• CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)\n• CFB (Cipher Feedback)\n• GCM (Galois Counter Mode)\n• CBC-MAC (Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code)\n• GMAC (Galois Message Authentication Code)\n• CCM (Counter with CBC-MAC)\nThe Cryptographic Accelerator accelerates Elliptical Curve Cryptography and supports the NIST (National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology) recommended curves including P-192 and P-256 for ECDH(Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) key derivation and ECDSA (El-\nliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) sign and verify operations.\nSupported hashes include SHA-1, SHA2/224, and SHA-2/256.\nThis implementation provides a fast and energy efficient solution to state of the art cryptographic needs.\n3.7.3  True Random Number Generator\nThe True Random Number Generator module is a non-deterministic random number generator that harvests entropy from a thermal\nenergy source. It includes start-up health tests for the entropy source as required by NIST SP800-90B and AIS-31 as well as online\nhealth tests required for NIST SP800-90C.\nThe TRNG is suitable for periodically generating entropy to seed an approved pseudo random number generator.\n3.7.4  Secure Debug with Lock/Unlock\nFor obvious security reasons, it is critical for a product to have its debug interface locked before being released in the field.\nIn addition, the Secure Element also provides a secure debug unlock function that allows authenticated access based on public key\ncryptography. This functionality is particularly useful for supporting failure analysis while maintaining confidentiality of IP and sensitive\nend-user data.\nMore information on this feature can be found in the Application Note AN1190: EFR32xG21 Secure Debug .\n3.8  Analog\n3.8.1  Analog Comparator (ACMP)\nThe Analog Comparator is used to compare the voltage of two analog inputs, with a digital output indicating which input voltage is high-\ner. Inputs are selected from among internal references and external pins. The tradeoff between response time and current consumption\nis configurable by software. Two 6-bit reference dividers allow for a wide range of internally-programmable reference sources. The\nACMP can also be used to monitor the supply voltage. An interrupt can be generated when the supply falls below or rises above the\nprogrammable threshold.EFR32MG21 Mighty Gecko Multiprotocol Wireless SoC Family Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world.

The flash memory is readable and writable\nfrom both the Cortex-M and DMA. In addition to the main flash array where Program code is normally written the MSC also provides an\nInformation block where additional information such as special user information or flash-lock bits are stored. There is also a read-only\npage in the information block containing system and device calibration data. Read and write operations are supported in energy modes\nEM0 Active and EM1 Sleep.\n3.10.3  Linked Direct Memory Access Controller (LDMA)\nThe Linked Direct Memory Access (LDMA) controller allows the system to perform memory operations independently of software. This\nreduces both energy consumption and software workload. The LDMA allows operations to be linked together and staged, enabling so-\nphisticated operations to be implemented.EFR32MG21 Mighty Gecko Multiprotocol Wireless SoC Family Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world.
