chip select ( CS), serial input (SI), serial output (SO) and serial clock (SCK) of the \nserial peripheral interface (SPI) bus.  The MRAM implements a subset of commands common to SPI EEPROM \nand SPI Flash components.   This allows the SPI MRAM to replace these components in the same socket \nand interoperate on a shared SPI bus.  The SPI MRAM offers superior write speed, unlimited endurance, low \nstandby & operating power, and simple, reliable data retention compared to other serial memory alterna -\ntives.\nFigure 1 – Block Diagram\nSingle or multiple devices can be connected to the bus as shown in Figure 2.  Pins SCK, SO and SI are com -\nmon among devices. Each device requires CS and HOLD  pins to be driven separately.  \nFigure 2 – System ConfigurationOVERVIEW\nSystem Configuration\nMOSI\nMISO\nMOSI = Master Out Slave In\nMISO = Master In Slave OutSCK\nSCK SI SO SCK SI SO\nHOLD\nCS\nHOLDCS\n2211HOLD HOLD CS CSSPI\nMicro ControllerEVERSPIN SPI MRAM 1 EVERSPIN SPI MRAM 2512Kb x 8\nMRAM ARRAYInstruction Decode\nClock Generator\nControl Logic\nWrite ProtectWP\nCS\nHOLD\nSCK\nSIInstruction Register\nAddress Register \nCounter\nSOData I/O Register\nNonvolatile Status\nRegister19 8\n4\nCopyright © Everspin Technologies 2020MR20H40 / MR25H406\nMR20H40 / MR25H40 Revision 12.6 8/2020Signal \nName Pin I/O Function Description \nCS 1 Input Chip SelectAn active low chip select for the serial MRAM. When chip select is high, the \nmemory is powered down to minimize standby power, inputs are ignored \nand the serial output pin is Hi-Z. Multiple serial memories can share a com -\nmon set of data pins by using a unique chip select for each memory.\nSO 2 Output Serial OutputThe data output pin is driven during a read operation and remains Hi-Z at \nall other times. SO is Hi-Z when HOLD  is low. Data transitions on the data \noutput occur on the falling edge of SCK.\nWP 3 Input Write ProtectA low on the write protect input prevents write operations to the Status \nRegister.\nVSS4Refer -\nenceGround Power supply ground pin.\nSI 5 Input Serial InputAll data is input to the device through this pin. This pin is sampled on the \nrising edge of SCK and ignored at other times. SI can be tied to SO to create \na single bidirectional data bus if desired.\nSCK 6 Input Serial ClockSynchronizes the operation of the MRAM. The clock can operate up to 50 \nMHz to shift commands, address, and data into the memory. Inputs are \ncaptured on the rising edge of clock. Data outputs from the MRAM occur \non the falling edge of clock. The serial MRAM supports both SPI Mode 0 \n(CPOL=0, CPHA=0) and Mode 3 (CPOL=1, CPHA=1). In Mode 0, the clock is \nnormally low. In Mode 3, the clock is normally high. Memory operation is \nstatic so the clock can be stopped at any time.\nHOLD 7 Input HoldA low on the Hold pin interrupts a memory operation for another task. \nWhen HOLD  is low, the current operation is suspended. The device will \nignore transitions on the CS and SCK when HOLD  is low. All transitions of \nHOLD  must occur while CS is low.\nVDD8 Supply Power Supply Power supply voltage from +3.0 to +3.6 volts.Table 1 – Pin FunctionsFigure 3 – DFN Package Pin Diagram (Top View)\nCS\nSO\nWP\nV   V\nHOLD\nSCK\nSI1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5SSDDPin Functions\nCopyright © Everspin Technologies 20207\nMR20H40 / MR25H40\nMR20H40 / MR25H40 Revision 12.6, 8/2020SPI COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL\nInstruction Description Binary Code Hex Code Address Bytes Data Bytes \nWREN Write Enable 0000  0110 06h 0 0 \nWRDI Write Disable 0000  0100 04h 0 0 \nRDSR 1Read Status Register 0000  0101 05h 0 1 \nWRSR Write Status Register 0000  0001 01h 0 1 \nREAD Read Data Bytes 0000  0011 03h 3 1 to ∞ \nWRITE Write Data Bytes 0000  0010 02h 3 1 to ∞ \nSLEEP Enter Sleep Mode 1011  1001 B9h 0 0 \nWAKE Exit Sleep Mode 1010  1011 ABh 0 0 Table 2 – Command CodesThe MR2xH40 can be operated in either SPI Mode 0 (CPOL=0, CPHA =0) or SPI Mode 3 (CPOL=1, CPHA=1).   \nFor both modes,  inputs are captured on the rising edge of the clock and data outputs occur on the falling \nedge of the clock.   When not conveying data,  SCK remains low for Mode 0; while in Mode 3, SCK is high.   \nThe memory determines the mode of operation (Mode 0 or Mode 3) based upon the state of the SCK when \nCS falls.\nAll memory transactions start when CS is brought low to the memory.   The first byte is a command code. \nDepending upon the command, subsequent bytes of address are input.   Data is either input or output. \nThere is only one command performed per CS active period.   CS must go inactive before another command \ncan be accepted.   To ensure proper part operation according to specifications, it is necessary to terminate \neach access by raising CS at the end of a byte (a multiple of 8 clock cycles from CS dropping) to avoid partial \nor aborted accesses.\nCommand Codes\nNote:\n1. An RDSR command cannot immediately follow a READ command.  If an RDSR command immediately follows a READ com -\nmand, the output data will not be correct.  Any other sequence of commands is allowed.  If an RDSR command is required \nimmediately following a READ command, it is necessary that another command be inserted before the RDSR is executed. \nAlternatively, two successive RDSR commands can be issued following the READ command.  The second RDSR will output the \nproper state of the Status Register. \nCopyright © Everspin Technologies 2020MR20H40 / MR25H408\nMR20H40 / MR25H40 Revision 12.6 8/2020WEL SRWD WP Protected Blocks Unprotected BlocksStatus \nRegister\n0 X X Protected Protected Protected\n1 0 X Protected Writable Writable\n1 1 Low Protected Writable Protected\n1 1 High Protected Writable WritableTable 4 – Memory Protection ModesWhen WEL is reset to 0, writes to all blocks and the status register are protected. When WEL is set to 1, BP0 \nand BP1 determine which memory blocks are protected.  While SRWD is reset to 0 and WEL is set to 1, \nstatus register bits BP0 and BP1 can be modified. Once SRWD is set to 1, WP must be high to modify SRWD, \nBP0 and BP1. Memory Protection ModesThe status register consists of the 8 bits listed in Table 3.  As seen in Table 4, the Status Register Write Disable \nbit (SRWD) is used in conjunction with bit 1 (WEL) and the Write Protection pin ( WP) to provide hardware \nmemory block protection. Bits BP0 and BP1 define the memory block arrays that are protected as described \nin Table 5.   The fast writing speed of the MR2xH40 does not require write status bits.  The state of bits 6,5,4, \nand 0 can be user modified and do not affect memory operation.

The memory leaves hardware block protection only when the WP pin goes high. \nWhile WP is low , the write protection blocks for the memory are determined by the status register bits BP0 \nand BP1 and cannot be modified without taking the WP signal high again. \nIf the WP signal is high (independent of the status of SRWD bit), the memory is in software protection mode. \nThis means that block write protection is controlled solely by the status register BP0 and BP1 block write pro -\ntect bits and this information can be modified using the WRSR command. \nStatus Register Memory Contents\nBP1 BP0 Protected Area Unprotected Area\n0 0 None All Memory\n0 1 Upper Quarter Lower Three-Quarters\n1 0 Upper Half Lower Half\n1 1 All NoneBlock Protection Modes\nCopyright © Everspin Technologies 2020MR20H40 / MR25H4010\nMR20H40 / MR25H40 Revision 12.6 8/2020The Read Status Register (RDSR) command allows the Status Register to be read.  The Status Register can be \nread to check the status of write enable latch bit, status register write protect bit, and block write protect \nbits.  For MR2xH40, the write in progress bit (bit 0) is not written by the memory because there is no write \ndelay.  The RDSR command is entered by driving CS low, sending the command code, and then driving CS \nhigh.  An RDSR command cannot immediately follow a READ command.  If an RDSR command immediately \nfollows a READ command, the output data will not be correct.  Any other sequence of commands is allowed.  \nIf an RDSR command is required immediately following a READ command, it is necessary that another com -\nmand be inserted before the RDSR is executed.  Alternatively, two successive RDSR commands can be issued \nfollowing the READ command.

The \nWRSR command is not executed unless the Write Enable Latch (WEL) has been set to 1 by executing a WREN \ncommand while pin WP and the Status Register SRWD (Bit 7) correspond to values that make the status reg -\nister writable as seen in Table 4 on page 8.   Status Register bits are non-volatile with the exception of the \nWEL which is reset to 0 upon power cycling.\nThe WRSR command is entered by driving CS low, sending the command code and status register write data \nbyte, and then driving CS high.The Write Disable (WRDI) command resets the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the status register (bit 1) to 0.  \nThis prevents writes to status register or memory.

Only address bits 0-18 are decoded by the memory.  The data bytes are read out sequentially \nfrom memory until the read operation is terminated by bringing CS high.   The entire memory can be read in \na single command.  The address counter will roll over to 0000H when the address reaches the top of memo -\nry. \nThe READ command is entered by driving CS low and sending the command code.

The entire memory can be \nwritten in a single command.  The address counter will roll over to 0000H when the address reaches the top \nof memory. \nUnlike EEPROM or Flash Memory, MRAM can write data bytes continuously at its maximum rated clock speed \nwithout write delays or data polling.  Back to back WRITE commands to any random location in memory can \nbe executed without write delay.  MRAM is a random access memory rather than a page, sector, or block \norganized memory so it is ideal for both program and data storage. \nThe WRITE command is entered by driving CS low, sending the command code, and then sequential write \ndata bytes.
