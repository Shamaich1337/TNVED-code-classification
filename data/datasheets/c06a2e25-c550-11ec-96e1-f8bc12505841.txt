It can \noperate to 7.5 GHz on the RF side and to 120  MHz at the PFD. \nIt consists of a low noise digital PFD (phase frequency detector),  a \nprecision charge pump, and a divider/prescaler. The divider/  \nprescaler val ue can be set by two external control pins to one of \nfour values (8, 16, 32, or 64). The reference divider is permanently \nset to 2, allowing an external REFIN frequency of up to 240 MHz.   \nA complete PLL (phase- locked loop) can be implemented if the \nsynthes izer is used with an external loop filter and a VCO (voltage  \ncontrolled oscillator). Its very high bandwidth means that \nfrequency doublers can be eliminated in many high frequency systems, simplifying system architecture and reducing cost.  \n \n \nFUNCTIONAL BL OCK DIAGRAM  \nREF IN\nRFINA\nRFINBVDD\nN2 N1 GNDR COUNTER\n÷ 2\nMUXMUXOUTCPGND RSETVP\nCPPHASE\nFREQUENCY\nDETECTORREFERENCE\nCHARGE\nPUMPADF4007\nN COUNTER\n÷ 8, ÷ 16,\n÷ 32, ÷ 64\nM2 M1\n04537-001 \nFigure 1. \n \nADF4007  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

RF Input Stage  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n PRESCALER P  \nThe prescaler, operating at CML levels, takes the clock from the \nRF input stage and divides it down to a manageable frequency \nfor the PFD. The prescaler can be selected to be either 8, 16, 32, \nor 64, and is effectively the N value in the PLL synthesizer. The terms N and P are used interchangeably in this data sheet. N1 \nand N2 set the prescaler values. The prescaler value should be \nchosen so that the prescaler output frequency is always less than or equal to 120 MHz, the maximum specified PFD frequency. Thus, with an RF frequency of 4 GHz, a prescaler value of 64 is valid, but a value of 32 or less is not valid. \n2][REFIN\nVCOfN f ×=  \nR COUNTER  \nThe R counter is perma nently set to 2. It allows the input reference  \nfrequency to be divided down by 2 to produce the reference clock  \nto the phase frequency detector (PFD).  \nPHASE FREQUENCY DETE CTOR (PFD) AND \nCHARGE PUMP  \nThe PFD takes inputs from the R counter and the N counte r \n(prescaler, P) and produces an output proportional to the phase \nand frequency difference between them. Figure 11 is a simplified  \nschematic. The PFD includes a fixed, 3 ns delay element that \ncontrols the width of t he antibacklash pulse. This pulse ensures \nthat there is no dead zone in the PFD transfer function and \nminimizes phase noise and reference spurs.  \nLOGIC HI D1\nD2Q1\nQ2CLR1\nCLR2CPU1\nU2UP\nDOWN\nCPGNDU3R DIVIDER\n3ns\nDELAY\nN DIVIDERVP\nCHARGE\nPUMP\n04537-017LOGIC HI\n \nFigure 11.

MUXOUT Circuit  PFD Polarity  \nThe PFD polarity is set by the state of M2 and M1 pins as given \nin the Table 5. The ability to set the polarity allows the use of VCOs  \nwith either positive or negative tuning characteristics. For standard VCOs with positive characteristics (output frequency  increases \nwith increasing tuning voltage), the polarity should be set to positive. This is accomplished by tying M2 and M1 to a logic low state.  \nCP Output  \nThe CP output state is also controlled by the state of M2 and M1.  It \ncan be set either to active (so that the loop can be locked) or to \nthree -state (open the loop). The normal state is CP output active.  \n \nData Sheet  ADF4007  \n \nRev.

In this case, the desired LO is 6.7 GHz. \nThe reference input signal is applied to the circuit at FREFIN \nand, in this case, is terminated in 50 Ω. Many systems would \nhave either a TCXO or an OCXO driving the reference input without any 50  Ω termination. To bias the REF\nIN pin at AVDD/2, \nac coupling is used. The value of the coupling capacitor used \ndepends on the input frequency. The equivalent impedance at \nthe input frequency should be less than 10 Ω. Given that the dc input impedance at the REF\nIN pin is 100 kΩ,  less than 0.1% of \nthe signal is lost.  \nThe charge pump output of the ADF4007 drives the loop filter. \nIn calculating the loop filter component values, a number of items need to be considered. In this example, the loop filter was designed  \nso that the overall phase margin for the system is 45°.  \n Other PLL system specifications are as follows:  \nK\nD = 5 mA  \nKV = 100 MHz/V  \nLoop Bandwidth = 300 kHz  \nFPFD = 106 MHz  \nN = 64  All these specifications are needed and used with the ADIsimPLL  \nto derive the loop filter component values shown in Figure 13. \nThe circuit in Figure 13 gives a typical phase noise performance \nof −100 dBc/Hz at 10  kHz offset from the carrier. Spurs are \nheavily attenuated by the loop filter and are below − 90 dBc.  \nThe loop filter output drives the  VCO, which, in turn, is fed \nback to the RF input of the PLL synthesizer and also drives the \nRF output terminal. A T -circuit configuration provides 50  Ω \nmatching between the VCO output, the RF output, and the RF\nIN \nterminal of the synthesizer.  \n \n \nADF4007\nN2\nN1\nM2\nM1100pF 100pF\n100pFCP\nMUXOUTGND\nGND\nGND5.6nF\n51Ω18Ω\n22Ω\nNOTE\nDECOUPLING CA PACITORS (0.1mF/10pF) ON AVDD, DV DD,AND V P OF THE ADF4007 AND ON\nVCC OF THE AD820 AND THE HMC358MS8G H AVE BEEN OMITTED FROM THE DIAGRAM\nTOAID CLARIT Y.RSETAVDD DVDDVP\nFREF INVCO\n100MHz/VHMC358MS8G\nRSET\n5.1kΩ6 17 18\n820\n15\n19\n9 3 210\n04537-019RFINA\nRFINB5\n4\n11\n12\n13\n14\nGND47nFAVDD7\nDVDD16\nREF INAVDD = 3.3V\n1kΩ18kΩ\nVCC = 12VVCC = 3.3V\n1kΩ\nAD820 10pF18Ω\n100pF18Ω100pF\nRFOUT\nLOGIC HI\nLOGIC HI\nLOGIC LO\nLOGIC LO\n \nFigure 13. 6.78 GHz Local Oscillator Using the ADF4007  \n \n \n \n \n \nADF4007  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

It operates up to 7.5 GHz on the RF side and can handle a PFD frequency of up to 120 MHz. The device integrates a low-noise digital phase frequency detector (PFD), a precision charge pump, and a divider/prescaler, which can be configured to divide by 8, 16, 32, or 64. The reference divider is fixed at 2, allowing for an external reference frequency of up to 240 MHz.

#### Typical Applications:
The ADF4007 is suitable for a wide range of applications, including:
- **Satellite Communications:** Used in systems requiring high-frequency signal generation and processing.
- **Broadband Wireless Access:** Facilitates the generation of stable frequencies for wireless communication.
- **CATV (Cable Television):** Employed in cable systems for frequency synthesis and signal processing.
- **Instrumentation:** Utilized in measurement and testing equipment that requires precise frequency control.
- **Wireless LANs:** Supports the generation of frequencies for wireless networking applications.

This component is particularly valuable in systems where high bandwidth and low phase noise are critical, allowing for simplified architectures and reduced costs by eliminating the need for frequency doublers in many high-frequency applications.
