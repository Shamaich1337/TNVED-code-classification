They are intended for use in applications employing the CAN serial communication physical\nlayer in accordance with the ISO 11898 standard. Each CAN transceiver is designed to provide differentialtransmit capability to the bus and differential receive capability to a CAN controller at speeds up to 1 Mbps.\nDesigned for operation in especially-harsh environments, these devices feature cross-wire protection,\nloss-of-ground and overvoltage protection, overtemperature protection, as well as wide common-mode range.\nThe transceiver interfaces the single-ended CAN controller with the differential CAN bus found in industrial,\nbuilding automation,  and automotive applications. It operates over a –2-V to 7-V common-mode range on the\nbus, and it can withstand common-mode transients of ±25 V.\nOn the SN65HVD230Q and SN65HVD231Q, R\nS (pin 8) provides three different modes of operation:\nhigh-speed, slope control, and low-power modes. The high-speed mode of operation is selected by connecting\npin 8 to ground, allowing the transmitter output transistors to switch on and off as fast as possible with nolimitation on the rise and fall slopes. The rise and fall slopes can be adjusted by connecting a resistor to ground\nat pin 8, since the slope is proportional to the pin’s output current. This slope control is implemented with external\nresistor values of 10 k Ω, to achieve a 15-V/ µs slew rate, to 100 k Ω, to achieve a 2-V/ µs slew rate.\nThe circuit of the SN65HVD230Q enters a low-current standby mode during which the driver is switched off and\nthe receiver remains active if a high logic level is applied to R\nS (pin 8). The DSP controller reverses this\nlow-current standby mode when a dominant state (bus differential voltage > 900 mV typical) occurs on the bus.\nThe unique difference between the SN65HVD230Q and the SN65HVD231Q is that both the driver and the\nreceiver are switched off in the SN65HVD231Q when a high logic level is applied to R S (pin 8) and remain in\nthis sleep mode until the circuit is reactivated by a low logic level on R S.\nThe V ref (pin 5 on the SN65HVD230Q and SN65HVD231Q) is available as a V CC/2 voltage reference.\nThe SN65HVD232Q is a basic CAN transceiver with no added options; pins 5 and 8 are NC, no connection.\nAVAILABLE OPTIONS/C0123/C0125\nFUNCTION\nNUMBERLOW\nPOWER MODEINTEGRATED SLOPE\nCONTROLVref PIN\n’230 370- µA standby mode Yes Yes\n’231 10-µA sleep mode Yes Yes\n’232 No standby or sleep mode No No\nPART NUMBER Q100 TA MARKED AS:\nSN65HVD230QD No\n40°CtHV230Q\nSN65HVD231QD No−40°C to\n125°CHV231Q\nSN65HVD232QD No125°C\nHV232Q\nSN65HVD230QDQ1 Yes\n40°Ct230Q1\nSN65HVD231QDQ1 Yes−40°C to\n125°C231Q1\nSN65HVD232QDQ1 Yes125°C\n232Q1\n†For the most current package and ordering information, see the Package Option\nAddendum at the end of this document, or see the TI web site at http://www .ti.com.\n‡Package drawings, thermal data, and symbolization are available at\nhttp://www.ti.com/packaging.\nThe D package is available taped and reeled.

standard. It presents a typical application circuit and test results,\nas well as discussions on slope control, total loop delay, and interoperability in 5-V systems.\nintroduction\nISO 11898 is the international standard for high-speed serial communication using the controller area network(CAN) bus protocol. It supports multimaster operation, real-time control, programmable data rates up to 1 Mbps,\nand powerful redundant error checking procedures that provide reliable data transmission. It is suited fornetworking intelligent  devices as well as sensors and actuators within the rugged electrical environment of a\nmachine chassis or factory floor. The SN65HVD230Q family of 3.3-V CAN transceivers implement the lowestlayers of the ISO/OSI reference model. This is the interface with the physical signaling output of the CANcontroller of the Texas Instruments TMS320Lx240x 3.3-V DSPs, as illustrated in Figure 26.\nSN65HVD230Q-Q1\nSN65HVD231Q-Q1\nSN65HVD232Q-Q1 \nSGLS398A − APRIL 2002 − REVISED APRIL 2008\n18 www.ti.comAPPLICATION INFORMATION\nTMS320Lx2403/6/7\n3.3-V\nDSPImplementation ISO 11898 Specification\nApplication Specific Layer\nData-Link\nLayerLogic Link Control\nMedium Access Control\nPhysical\nLayerPhysical Signaling\nPhysical Medium Attachment\nMedium Dependant InterfaceEmbedded\nCAN\nController\nSN65HVD230\nCAN Bus−Line\nFigure 26.

The output of a DSP’s CAN controlleris connected to the serial driver input, pin D, and receiver serial output, pin R, of the transceiver. The transceiver\nis then attached to the differential bus lines at pins CANH and CANL. T ypically, the bus is a twisted pair of wires\nwith a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω, in the standard half-duplex multipoint topology of Figure 28. Each end\nof the bus is terminated with 120- Ω resistors in compliance with the standard to minimize signal reflections on\nthe bus.\nSN65HVD230Q-Q1\nSN65HVD231Q-Q1\nSN65HVD232Q-Q1 \nSGLS398A − APRIL 2002 − REVISED APRIL 2008\n19 www.ti.comAPPLICATION INFORMATION\nTMS320Lx2403/6/7\nCAN Bus LineCAN-Controller\nCANTX/IOPC6\nSN65HVD230Electronic Control Unit (ECU)\nCANH CANLDRCANRX/IOPC7\nFigure 27.

The failsafe design of the receiver assures a logic high at the receiver output ifthe bus wires become open circuited. If a high ambient operating environment temperature or excessive outputcurrent result in thermal shutdown, the bus pins become high impedance, while the D and R pins default to alogic high.\nSN65HVD230Q-Q1\nSN65HVD231Q-Q1\nSN65HVD232Q-Q1 \nSGLS398A − APRIL 2002 − REVISED APRIL 2008\n20 www.ti.comAPPLICATION INFORMATION\nfeatures of the SN65HVD230Q, SN65HVD231Q, and SN65HVD232Q (continued)\nThe bus pins are also maintained in a high-impedance state during low V CC conditions to ensure glitch-free\npower-up and power-down bus protection for hot-plugging applications. This high-impedance condition alsomeans that an unpowered node will not disturb the bus. Transceivers without this feature usually have a verylow output impedance. This results in a high current demand when the transceiver is unpowered, a conditionthat could affect the entire bus.\noperating modes\nRS (pin 8) of the SN65HVD230Q and SN65HVD231Q provides for three different modes of operation:\nhigh-speed mode, slope-control mode, and low-power standby mode.\nhigh-speed mode\nThe high-speed mode can be selected by applying a logic low to Rs (pin 8). The high-speed mode of operation\nis commonly employed in industrial applications. High-speed allows the output to switch as fast as possible withno internal limitation on the output rise and fall slopes. The only limitations of the high-speed operation are cablelength and radiated emission concerns, each of which is addressed by the slope control mode of operation.\nIf the low-power standby mode is to be employed in the circuit, direct connection to a DSP output pin can be\nused to switch between a logic-low level (< 1 V) for high speed mode operati on, and the logic-high level (> 0.75\nV\nCC) for standby mode operation. Figure 29 shows a typical DSP connection, and Figure 30 shows the\nSN65HVD230Q driver output signal in high-speed mode on the CAN bus.\nTMS320LF2406\nor\nTMS320LF2407IOPF61\n2\n348\n7\n65D\nGND\nVCC\nRCANH\nCANL\nVrefRSSN65HVD230Q\nFigure 29.

T o reduce the electromagnetic interference generated by fast rise times and resulting harmonics, the rise\nand fall slopes of the SN65HVD230Q and SN65HVD231Q driver outputs can be adjusted by connecting aresistor from R\nS (pin 8) to ground or to a logic low voltage, as shown in Figure 31. The slope of the driver output\nsignal is proportional to the pin’s output current. This slope control  is implemented with an external resistor value\nof 10 k Ω to achieve a ≈ 15 V/ µs slew rate, and up to 100 k Ω to achieve a ≈ 2.0 V/ µs slew rate as displayed in\nFigure 32.

It makes no difference if a slope control\nresistor is in place as shown in F igure 31. The DSP can reverse this low-power standby mode when the rising\nedge of a dominant state (bus differential voltage > 900 mV typical) occurs on the bus. The DSP, sensing busactivity, reactivates the driver circuit by placing a logic low (< 1.2 V) on R\nS (pin 8).\nthe babbling idiot protection of the SN65HVD231Q\nOccasionally, a runaway CAN controller unintentionally sends messages that completely tie up the bus (what\nis referred to in CAN jargon as a babbling idiot). When this occurs, the DSP can engage the listen-only  standby\nmode to disengage the driver and release the bus, even when access to the CAN controller has been lost. Whenthe driver circuit is deactivated, its outputs default to a high-impedance state.\nsleep mode of the SN65HVD231Q\nThe unique diff erence between the SN65HVD230Q and the SN65HVD231Q  is that both driver and receiver are\nswitched off in the SN65HVD231Q when a logic high is applied to R\nS (pin 8). The device remains in a very low\npower-sleep mode until the circuit is reactivated with a logic low applied to R S (pin 8).  While in this sleep mode,\nthe bus pins are in a high-impedance state, while the D and R pins default to a logic high.\nloop propagation delay\nTransceiver loop delay is a measure of the overall device propagation delay, consisting of the delay from thedriver input to the differential outputs, plus the delay from the receiver inputs to its output.\nThe loop delay of the transceiver displayed in F igure 34 increases accordingly when slope control is being used.\nThis increased loop delay means that the total bus length must be reduced to meet the CAN bit-timingrequirements of the overall system. The loop delay becomes ≈100 ns when employing slope control with a\n10-k Ω resistor , and ≈500 ns with a 100-k Ω resistor. Therefore, considering that the rule-of-thumb propagation\ndelay of typical bus cable is 5 ns/m, slope control with the 100-k Ω resistor decreases the allowable bus length\nby the difference between the 500-ns max loop delay and the loop delay with no slope control, 70.7 ns. Thisequates to (500–70.7 ns)/5 ns, or approximately 86 m less bus length. This slew-rate/bus length trade-off toreduce electromagnetic interference to adjoining circuits from the bus can also be solved with a high-qualityshielded bus cable.\nSN65HVD230Q-Q1\nSN65HVD231Q-Q1\nSN65HVD232Q-Q1 \nSGLS398A − APRIL 2002 − REVISED APRIL 2008\n24 www.ti.comAPPLICATION INFORMATION\nFigure 34. 70.7-ns Loop Delay Through the SN65HVD230Q With R S = 0\nSN65HVD230Q-Q1\nSN65HVD231Q-Q1\nSN65HVD232Q-Q1 \nSGLS398A − APRIL 2002 − REVISED APRIL 2008\n25 www.ti.comAPPLICATION INFORMATION\ninteroperability with 5-V CAN systems\nIt is essential that the 3.3-V SN65HVD230Q family performs seamlessly with 5-V transceivers because of the\nlarge number of 5-V devices installed.
