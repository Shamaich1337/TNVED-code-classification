interface Flash  memory device designed for use in a wide variety of high -volume \nconsumer based applications in which program code is shadowed from Flash memory into embedded or \nexternal RAM for execution. The flexible erase architecture of the device, with its page erase granularity it is \nideal for data storage as well, eliminatin g the need for additional data storage devices.  \nThe erase block sizes of the device have been optimized to meet the needs of today\'s code and data storage \napplications. By optimizing the size of the erase blocks, the memory space can be used much more effi ciently. \nBecause certain code modules and data storage segments must reside by themselves in their own erase \nregions, the wasted and unused memory space that occurs with large sectored and large block erase Flash \nmemory devices can be greatly reduced. This  increased memory space efficiency allows additional code \nroutines and data storage segments to be added while still maintaining the same overall device density.  \nThe device also contains an additional 3*512 -byte security registers with OTP lock (One -Time \nProgrammable) , can be used for purposes such as unique device serialization, system -level Electronic Serial \nNumber (ESN) storage, locked key storage, etc.  \nSpecifically designed for use in many different systems, the device supports read, program, and eras e \noperations with a wide supply voltage range of 2.3V to 3.6V. No separate voltage is required for programming \nand erasing.  \n \n \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 6 of 68 3 Pin Definition  \n3.1 Pin Configurations  \nCS#\nSO\nWP#HOLD#\nSLCK\nSIVCC\nGND1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5CS#\nSO\nWP#HOLD#\nSLCK\nSIVCC\nGND1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5\n \n8-PIN SOP (150mil/20 8mil) and TSSOP      8-Land USON  (3x2mm/3x4mm/ 6x5mm ) \n \n \n3.2 Pin Descriptions  \nNo. Symbol  Extension  Remarks  \n1 CS#  Chip select  \n2 SO SIO1  Serial data output for 1 x I/O  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \n3 WP#  SIO2  Write protection active low  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \n4 GND  - Ground of the device  \n5 SI SIO0  Serial data input for 1x I/O  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \n6 SCLK  - Serial interface clock input  \n7 HOLD#  SIO3  To pause the device without deselecting the device  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \n8 Vcc - Power supply of the device  \n \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 7 of 68 4 Block Diagram  \n \nSerial Bus \nControl Logic\nAddress LatchFlash Memory ArrayData buffer\nY-DECODERX -DECODER\nSerial MUX &\nI/O buffersHigh Voltage Generator\nControl and\nProtection logicWP#\nHOLD#SOCS#\nSCK\nVCC\nGNDInterface\nControl &\nLogicSI\n \n \n \n \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 8 of 68 5 Electrical Specifications  \n5.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings  \n\uf06e Storage T emperature ....................... -65° C to +150° C  \n\uf06e Operation Temperature  ................... .-40° C  to +85° C  \n\uf06e Maximum Operation Voltage. ............ 4.0V \n\uf06e Voltage on Any Pin with  \nrespect to Grou nd. .......................... -0.6V to + 4.1V  \n\uf06e DC Output  Current ........................... .5.0 mA \n \nTable 5 -1 Pin Capacitance  [1]  \nSymbol  Parameter  Max.

In addition, the control \nregister architecture of the device constrains that the memory contents can only be changed after specific \ncommand sequences have completed successfully.  \nIn the f ollowing, there are several features to protect the system from the accidental write cycles during VCC \npower -up and power -down or from system noise.  \n• Power -on reset: to avoid sudden power switch by system power supply transition, the power -on reset may \nprotect the Flash.  \n• Valid command length checking: The command length will be checked whether it is at byte base and \ncompleted on byte boundary.  \n• Write Enable (WREN) command: WREN command is required to set the Write Enable Latch bit (WEL) \nbefore issuing o ther commands to change data.  \n• Software Protection Mode: The Block Protect (BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits define the section of the \nmemory array that can be read but not change.  \n• Hardware Protection Mode: WP# going low to protected the BP0~BP4bits an d SRP0~1bits  \n• Deep Power -Down Mode: By entering deep power down mode, the flash device is under protected from \nwriting all commands except the Release form Deep Power -Down Mode command.  \n \nTable 6 -1.

In standby mode, SO pin of this LSI should be High -Z. When correct \ncommand is inputted to this LSI, this LSI becomes active mode and keeps the active mode until next CS# \nrising edge.  \nInput data is latched on the rising edge of Serial Clock (SCLK) and data shifts out on the falling edge of SCLK. \nThe difference of serial peripheral interface mode 0 and mode 3 is shown as Figure 8 -1.  \nFor the following instructions: RDID, RDSR, RDSR1, RDSC UR, READ, FAST_READ, DREAD, 2READ, \n4READ, QREAD, RDSFDP, RES, REMS, DREMS, QREMS, the shifted -in instruction sequence is followed \nby a data -out sequence. After any bit of data being shifted out, the CS# can be high. For the following \ninstructions: WREN, WR DI, WRSR, PE, SE, BE32K, BE, CE, PP, DPP, QPP, DP, ERSCUR, PRSCUR, \nSUSPEND, RESUME, RSTEN, RST, the CS# must go high exactly at the byte boundary; otherwise, the \ninstruction will be rejected and not executed.  \nDuring the progress of Write Status Register, P rogram, Erase operation, to access the memory array is \nneglected and not affect the current operation of Write Status Register, Program, Erase.  \nFigure 8-1 Serial Peripheral Interface Modes Supported  \n \nSCLK \nMSB CPHA shift in shift out \nSI 0 \n1 CPOL \n0 (Serial mode 0) \n(Serial mode 3) 1 \nSO SCLK \nMSB \nNote:  \nCPOL  indicates  clock  polarity  of serial  maste r, CPOL=1  for SCLK  high while  idle, CPOL=0  for SCLK  low while  not transmitting.  CPHA  \nindicates  clock  phase.  The combination  of CPOL  bit and CPHA  bit decides  which  serial  mode  is supported.  \n \nStandard SPI  \nThe P25Q16H  features a serial peripheral interface on 4 signals bus: Serial Clock (SCLK), Chip Select (CS#), \nSerial Data Input (SI) and Serial Data Output (SO). Both SPI bus mode 0 and 3 are supported. Input data is \nlatched on the rising edge of SCLK and data shifts out on the falling edge of SCLK.  \nDual SPI  \nThe P25Q16H  supports Dual SPI operation when using the “Dual Output  Fast Read”  and “Dual I/O  Fast \nRead”(3BHand BBH)  commands. These commands  allow data to be transferred to or from the device at two \ntimes the rate  of the standard SPI.  When using  the Dual SPI command the SI and SO pins become \nbidirectional I/O pins: IO0 and IO1.  \n \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 19 of 68    \n  Quad SPI  \nThe P25Q16H  supports Quad SPI operation when using  the “Quad Output  Fast Read”,”  Quad I/O  Fast \nRead”(6BH,EBH)  commands.  These commands allow data to be transferred to or from the device at four \ntimes the rate of the standard SPI. When using the Quad  SPI command the SI and SO pins become \nbidirectional I/O pins: IO0 and IO1, and WP# and HOLD# pins become IO2 andIO3. Quad SPI  comman ds \nrequire the non -volatile Quad Enable bit(QE) in Status Register to be set.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 20 of 68 9 Hold Feature  \nHOLD# pin signal goes low to hold any serial communications with the device. The HOLD feature will not \nstop the operation of write status register, programming, or erasing in progress.  \nThe operation of HOLD requires Chip Select(CS#) keeping low and starts on falling edge of HOLD# pin  \nsignal while Serial Clock (SCLK) signal is being low (if Serial Clock signal is not being low, HOLD operatio n \nwill not start until Serial Clock signal being low). The HOLD condition ends on the rising edge of HOLD# pin \nsignal while Serial Clock(SCLK) signal is being low( if Serial Clock signal is not being low, HOLD operation \nwill not end until Serial Clock bein g low).  \n \nFigure 9-1 Hold Condition Operation  \nHOLD HOLD CS# \nSCLK \nHOLD# \n \nDuring the HOLD operation, the Serial Data Output (SO) is high impedance when Hold# pin goes low and will \nkeep high impedance until Hold# pin goes high. The Serial Data Input (SI) is  don\'t care if both Serial Clock \n(SCLK) and Hold# pin goes low and will keep the state until SCLK goes low and Hold# pin goes high. If Chip \nSelect (CS#) drives high during HOLD operation, it will reset the internal logic of the device. To re -start \ncommunic ation with chip, the HOLD# must be at high and CS# must be at low.  \nNote: The HOLD feature is disabled during Quad I/O mode.  \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 21 of 68 10 Commands  \n10.1 Commands listing  \nFigure 10-1 Command set  \nCommands  Abbr.

This gives more flexibility to \nchange the system configuration and memory protection schemes quickly without waiting for the typical \nnon-volatile bit write cycles or affecting the endurance of the Status Register non -volatile bits. The Write \nEnable for Volatile Status Register command must be issued prior to a Write Status Register command. The \nWrite Enable for Volatile Status Register command will not set the Write Enable Latch bit, it is only valid for \nthe Write Status Register command to change the volatile Status Register bit values.  \nThe sequence of issuing Write Enable for Volatile Status Register instruction is: CS# goes low→ sendi ng \nWrite Enable for Volatile Status Register instruction code→ CS# goes high.  \nFigure 10 -4 Write Enable  for Volatile Status Register Sequence (Command 50 ) \nCS#\n \nSCLK  \n SI\n \nSO 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \nHigh-ZCommand(50H)\n \n10.5 Read Status Register (RDSR ) \nThe RDSR instruction is for reading Status Re gister Bits.

It is recommended to check the Write in Progress \n(WIP) bit before sending a new instruction when a program, erase, or write status regist er operation is in \nprogress. For command code “05H”, the SO will output Status Register bits S7~S0. The command code \n“35H”, the SO will output Status Register bits S15~S8  \nThe sequence of issuing RDSR instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending RDSR instruction c ode→ Status \nRegister data out on SO.

When WIP bit sets to 1, means the device is busy in program/erase/write status register progress, \nwhen WIP bit sets 0, means the device is  not in program/erase/write status register progress.  \nWEL bit.  \nThe Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit indicates the status of the internal Write Enable Latch. When set to 1 the \ninternal Write Enable Latch is set, when set to 0 the internal Write Enable Latch i s reset and no Write Status \nRegister, Program or Erase command is accepted.  \nBP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 bits.  \nThe Block Protect (BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits are non -volatile. They define the size of the area to be \nsoftware protected against Program and  Erase commands. These bits are written with the Write Status \nRegister (WRSR) command. When the Block Protect (BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits are set to 1, the \nrelevant memory area (as defined in Table “Protected Area Sizes”).becomes protected against Page Program \n(PP), Page Erase (PE), Sector Erase (SE) and Block Erase (BE) commands. The Block Protect (BP4, BP3, \nBP2, BP1, and BP0) bits can be written provided that the Hardware Protected mode has not been set. The \nChip Erase (CE) command is executed, only if  the Block Protect (BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1and BP0) are set to \n“None protected”.  \nSRP1, SRP0 bits.  \nThe Status Register Protect (SRP1 and SRP0) bits are non -volatile Read/Write bits in the status register. The \nSRP bits control the method of write protection: sof tware protection, hardware protection, power supply \nlock-down or one time programmable protection  \nSRP1  SRP0  WP#  Status Register  Description  \n0 0 x Software Protected  The Status Register can be written to after a Write \nEnable command, WEL=1.(Default)  \n0 1 0 Hardware Protected  WP#=0,  the Status Register locked and cannot  be \nwritten to.  \n0 1 1 Hardware Unprotected  WP#=1,  the Status Register is unlocked and can be \nwritten to after a Write Enable command, WEL=1.  \n \n1 0 x Power Supply \nLock -Down(1)  Status Register is protected and cannot  be written to \nagain until the next Power -Down, Power -Up cycle.  \n 1 1 x One Time Program(2)  Status Register is permanently protected and cannot  be \nwritten to.  \n NOTE:  \n1. When SRP1, SRP0=(1, 0), a Power -Down, Power -Up cycle will change SRP1, SRP0 to (0, 0) state.  \n2. This feature is available on special order. Please contact PUYA for details.  \n \nQE bit.  \nThe Quad Enable (QE) bit is a non -volatile Read/Write bit in the Status Register that allows Quad operation. \nWhen the QE bit is set to 0 (Default) the WP# pin and HOLD# pin are enable. When the QE pin is set to 1, the \nQuad IO2 and IO3 pins are enabled. (The QE bit should never be set to 1 during standard SPI or Dual SPI \noperation if the WP# or HOLD# pins are tied directly to  the power supply or ground)  \nLB3, LB2, LB1, bits.  \nThe LB3, LB2, LB1, bits are non -volatile One Time Program (OTP) bits in Status Register (S13 -S11) that \nprovide the write protect control and status to the Security Registers. The default state of LB3 -LB1are 0, the \nsecurity registers are unlocked. The LB3 -LB1bitscan be set to 1 individually using the Write Register \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 26 of 68 instruction. The LB3 -LB1bits are One Time Programmable, once its set to 1, the Security Registers will \nbecome read -only permanently.  \nCMP bit  \nThe C MP bit is a non -volatile Read/Write bit in the Status Register(S14). It is used in conjunction the \nBP4-BP0 bits to provide more flexibility for the array protection. Please see the table “Protected Area Size” for \ndetails. The default setting is CMP=0.  \nSUS1 , SUS2bit  \nThe SUS1 and SUS2bit are read only bit in the status register (S15and S10) that are set to 1 after executing \nan Program/Erase Suspend (75H or B0H) command (The Erase Suspend will set the SUS1 to 1,and the \nProgram Suspend will set the SUS2 to 1). The SUS1 and SUS2 bit are cleared to 0 by Program/Erase \nResume (7AH or 30H) command as well as a power -down, power -up cycle.  \n \n10.6 Read Configure  Register (RD CR) \nThe RD CR instruction is for reading Configure  Register Bits. The Read Configure  Register can be read at any \ntime (even in program/erase/write status register condition). It is recommended to check the Write in \nProgress (WIP) bit before sending a new instruction when a program, erase, or write status register operation \nis in progress.   \nThe sequence of issuing RD CR instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending RD CR instruction code→ Configure  \nRegister data out on SO.  The SIO[3:1] are "don\'t care".  \nFigure 10 -6 Read Status Register (RD CR) Sequence (Command 15) \nCommand 0     1    2     3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10  11  12  13  14  15   16  17  18   19  20   21  22   23  \n15H CS# \nSCLK \nSI \nSO High-Z \n7    6    5     4     3    2    1    0    7    6     5    4    3    2     1    0    7  \nMSB Configure Register Out Configure Register Out \nMSB \n \nConfigure  Register  \nBit7 Bit6 Bit5 Bit4 Bit3 Bit2 Bit1 Bit0 \nDP Reserved  Reserved  Reserved  Reserved  Reserved  Reserved  Reserved  \nDP bit. \nThe Dual Page  (DP) bit is a non -volatile Read/Write bit in the Configure  Register that allows Dual Page  mode \noperation. When the DP bit is set to 0 (Default) the page size  is 256bytes . When the DP pin is set to 1, the \npage size is 512bytes .  \nThis bit controls the page programming buffer address wrap point. Legacy SPI devices generally have used  a \n256 Byte page pr ogramming buffer and defined that if data is loaded into the buffer beyond the 255 Byte \nlocation , the address at  which additional bytes are loaded would be wrapped to address zero of the buffer. \nThe P25Q16H  provides a 512 Byte page  programming buffer that can increase programming performance. \nFor legacy software compatibility, this configuration bit provides  the option to continue the wrapping behavior \nat the 256 Byte boundary or to enable full use of the available 512 Byte buffer by not  wrapping the load \naddress at the 256 Byte boundary.  When the DP pin is set to 1,  the page erase instruction (81h) will erase the \ndata of the chosen Dual Page to be "1" .  \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 27 of 68 10.7 Active Status Interrupt (ASI)  \nTo simplify the readout of the WIP bit, the Active Status Interrupt command (25h) may be used. It is then not \nnecessary to continuously read the status register, it is sufficient to monitor the value of the SO line. If the SO \nline is connected to an interr upt line on the host controller, the host controller may be in sleep mode until the \nSO line indicates that the device is ready for the next command.  \nThe WIP bit can be read at any time, including during an internally self -timed program or erase operation.   \nTo enable the Active Status Interrupt command, the CS pin must first be asserted and the opcode of 25h must \nbe clocked into the device. For SPI Mode3, at least one dummy bit has to be clocked into the device after the \nlast bit of the opcode has been cloc ked in. (In most cases, this is most easily done by sending a dummy byte \nto the device.) The value of the SI line after the opcode is clocked in is of no significance to the operation. For \nSPI Mode 0, this dummy bit (dummy byte) is not required.  \nThe value of WIP is then output on the SO line, and is continuously updated by the device for as long as the \nCS pin remains asserted. Additional clocks on the SCK pin are not required. If the WIP bit changes from 1 to \n0 while the CS pin is asserted, the SO line will  change from 1 to 0. (The WIP bit cannot change from 0 to 1 \nduring an operation, so if the SO line already is 0, it will not change.)  \nDeasserting the CS pin will terminate the Active Status Interrupt operation and put the SO pin into a \nhigh-impedance stat e. The CS pin can be deasserted at any time and does not require that a full byte of data \nbe read.  \nThe sequence of issuing ASI instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending 25H code→ WIP data out on SO  \nFigure 10 -7 Active Status Interrupt (ASI) Sequence (Command 25 ) \nCommand 0     1    2     3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10  11  12  13  14  15   16  17  18      \n25H CS# \nSCLK \nSI \nSO High - Z \n RDY/BSY  \n High - Z\n \n10.8 Write Status Register (WRSR ) \nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) command allows new values to be written to the Status Register. Before it \ncan be accepted, a Write Enable (WREN) command must previously have been executed. After the Write \nEnable (WREN) command has been decoded and executed, the device sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL).  \nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) command has no effect on S15, S10, S1 and S0 of the Status Register. \nCS# must be driven high after the eighth or sixteen bit of the data byte has been latched in. If not, the Write \nStatus Register (WRSR) command is not executed. If CS# is driven high after eighth bit of the data byte, the \nCMP and QE and SRP1 bits will be cleared to 0. As soon as CS# is driven high, t he self -timed Write Status \nRegister cycle (whose duration is tW) is initiated. While the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the \nStatus Register may still be read to check the value of the Write In Progress (WIP) bit. The Write In Progress \n(WIP) bi t is 1 during the self -timed Write Status Register cycle, and is 0 when it is completed. When the cycle \nis completed, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is reset.  \nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) command allows the user to change the values of the Block Protect  (BP4, \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 28 of 68 BP3, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits, to define the size of the area that is to be treated as read -only, as defined in \nTable1. The Write Status Register (WRSR) command also allows the user to set or reset the Status Register \nProtect (SRP1 and SRP0) bits in accordance with the Write Protect (WP#) signal. The Status Register \nProtect (SRP1 and SRP0) bits and Write Protect (WP#) signal allow the device to be put in the Hardware \nProtected Mode. The Write Status Register (WRSR) command is not executed once the Har dware Protected \nMode is entered.  \nThe sequence of issuing WRSR instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending WRSR instruction code→ Status \nRegister data on SI→CS# goes high.  \nThe CS# must go high exactly at the 8 bits or 16 bits data boundary; otherwise, the instruc tion will be rejected \nand not executed. The self -timed Write Status Register cycle time (tW) is initiated as soon as Chip Select \n(CS#) goes high. The Write in Progress (WIP) bit still can be checked during the Write Status Register cycle \nis in progress. Th e WIP sets 1 during the tW timing, and sets 0 when Write Status Register Cycle is \ncompleted, and the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset.  \nFigure  10-8 Write Status Register (WRSR) Sequence (Command 01 ) \nCommand 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n01H CS# \nSCLK \nSI \nSO High-Z 8 9    10    11   12  13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20    21   22   23  \nMSB 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0    15   14   13   12   11   10    9  Status Register in \n8 \n \n10.9 Write Configure  Register (WR CR) \nThe Write Configure  Register (WR CR) command allows new values to be written to the Configure  Register. \nBefore it can be accepted, a Write Enable (WREN) command must previously have been executed. After the \nWrite Enable (WREN) command has been decoded and executed, the device sets the Write Enable Latch \n(WEL).  \nThe sequence of issuing WR CR instruc tion is: CS# goes low→ sending WR CR instruction code→ Configure  \nRegister data on SI→CS# goes high.  \nThe CS# must go high exactly at the 8 bits data boundary; otherwise, the instruction will be rejected and not \nexecuted.

Once M[5:4 ] ≠ (1,0) and afterwards CS# is raised and then \nlowered, the system then will escape from performance enha nce mode and return to normal operation. A \n“Continuous Read Mode” Reset command can be used to reset (M5 -4) before issuing normal command  \nWhile Program/Erase/Write Status Register cycle is in progress, 4READ instruction is rejected without any \nimpact on th e Program/Erase/Write Status Register current cycle.  \nFigure 10-16 4 X IO Read Mode Sequence (Command EB  M5-4 ≠ (1,0) ) \nCommand 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \nEBH CS# \nSCLK \nSI(IO0) \nSO(IO1) 8  9    10  11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19    20   21   22   23  \n4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 \n5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 \nA23-16A15-8A7-0 M7-0 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 \n7 3 7 3 7 3 7 3 7 3 7 3 WP#(IO2) \nHOLD#(IO3) 4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \nDummy Byte1    Byte2 \n \nNote:  \n1.

A Write Enable (WREN) \ninstruction must execute to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit before sending the Page Program (PP).   \nThe device programs only the last 256 data bytes sent to the device. If the entire 256 data bytes are going to \nbe programmed, A7 -A0 (The eight least significant address bits) should be set to 0. If the eight least \nsignificant address bits ( A7-A0) are not all 0, all transmitted data going beyond the end of the current page \nare programmed from the start address of the same page (from the address A7 -A0 are all 0). If more than 256 \nbytes are sent to the device, the data of the last 256 -byte is p rogrammed at the request page and previous \ndata will be disregarded.  If less than 256 bytes are sent to the device, the data is programmed at the \nrequested address of the page.  \nFor the very best performance, programming should be done in full pages of 256  bytes aligned on 256 byte \nboundaries with each Page being programmed only once. Using the Page Program (PP) command to load an \nentire page, within the page boundary, will save overall programming time versus loading less than a page \ninto the program buffe r.  \nIt is possible to program from one byte up to a page size in each Page programming operation.

The command is followed by a \n3-byte address (A23 -A0) and a dummy byte, each bit being latched -in during the rising edge of SCLK. Then \nthe memory content, at that address, is shifted out on SO, each bit being shifted out, at a Max frequency fC , \nduring the falling edge of SCLK. The first byte addressed can be at any location. The address is automatically \nincremented to the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted out. Once the A8 -A0 address \nreaches the last byte of the register (By te 1FFH), it will reset to 000H, the command is completed by driving \nCS# high.  \nThe sequence of issuing RDSCUR instruction is : CS# goes low → sending RDSCUR instruction → sending \n24 bit address → 8 bit dummy byte → Security Register data out on SO → CS# go es high.  \nAddress  A23-16 A15-12 A11-9 A8-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00H 0001  000 Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00H 0010  000 Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00H 0011  000 Byte Address  \n \nFigure 10-29 Read Security Registers  (RDSCUR) Sequence (Command 48 ) \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 44 of 68 \nCommand 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n48H CS# \nSCLK \nSI \nSO High-Z 8  9   10  28   29   30   31 \n3 2 1 0  24-bitaddress \nMSB   \n6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Data Out1    \n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 \n6 5 7 Data Out2 CS# \nSCLK \nSI \nSO \nMSB DummyByte 23   22  21\n32   33   34   35   36   37   38   39   4041   42   43   44   45   46   47 \n10.30  Deep Power -down (DP)  \nThe Deep Power -down (DP) instruction is for setting the device on the minimizing the power consumption (to \nentering the Deep Power -down mode), the standby current is reduced from ISB1 to ISB2). The Deep \nPower-down mode requires the Deep Power -down (DP) instruction to enter, during the Deep Power -down \nmode, the device is not active and all Write/Program/Erase instruction are ignored.  When CS# goes high, \nit\'s only in standby mode not deep power -down mode.  It \'s different from Standby mode.  \nThe sequence of issuing DP instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending DP instruction code→ CS# goes high.  \nOnce the DP instruction is set, all instruction will be ignored except the Release from Deep Power -down \nmode (RDP) and Rea d Electronic Signature (RES) instruction. (RES instruction to allow the ID been read out). \nWhen Power - down, the deep power -down mode automatically stops, and when power -up, the device \nautomatically is in standby mode. For RDP instruction the CS# must go h igh exactly at the byte boundary (the \nlatest eighth bit of instruction code been latched -in); otherwise, the instruction will not be executed. As soon \nas Chip Select (CS#) goes high, a delay of tDP is required before entering the Deep Power -down mode and \nreducing the current to ISB2.  \nFigure 10-30 Deep Power -down (DP) Sequence (Command B9)  \nCommand  0    1    2    3     4    5    6    7     \nB9H\n CS# \nSCLK\n \nSI\n tDP \nStandby mode Deep power-down mode \n \n10.31  Release form Deep Power -Down (RDP), Read Electronic Signature (RES)  \nThe Release from Deep Power -down (RDP) instruction is terminated by driving Chip Select (CS#) High. \nWhen Chip Select (CS#) is driven high, the device is put in the Stand -by Power mode. If the device was not \npreviously in the Deep Power -down mode, the trans ition to the Stand -by Power mode is immediate. If the \ndevice was previously in the Deep Power -down mode, though, the transition to the Stand -by Power mode is \ndelayed by tRES2, and Chip Select (CS#) must remain High for at least tRES2(max). Once in the Stan d-by \nP25Q 16H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 45 of 68 Power mode, the device waits to be selected, so that it can receive, decode and execute instructions.  \nRES instruction is for reading out the old style of 8 -bit Electronic Signature, whose values are shown as table \nof ID Definitions.  This is not the s ame as RDID instruction. It is not recommended to use for new design. For \nnew design, please use RDID instruction.  Even in Deep power -down mode, the RDP and RES are also \nallowed to be executed, only except the device is in progress of program/erase/write cycle; there\'s no effect \non the current program/erase/ write cycle in progress.  \nThe RES instruction is ended by CS# goes high after the ID been read out at least once. The ID outputs \nrepeatedly if continuously send the additional clock cycles on SCLK while  CS# is at low.  If the device was \nnot previously in Deep Power -down mode, the device transition to standby mode is immediate.   If the \ndevice was previously in Deep Power -down mode, there\'s a delay of tRES2 to transit to standby mode, and \nCS# must remain to high at least tRES2 (max).
