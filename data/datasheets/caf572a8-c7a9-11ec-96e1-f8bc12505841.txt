The connector should fit tightly against the circuit board edge, avoid gaps.\nb. The center contact pin must lie parallel and flat against the cir cuit board, avoid gaps.\nc. The contact pin should be centered on the circuit board signal trace.\nd. Use a minimal amount of solder between the contact pin and signal trace. Do not \nallow excess solder to build up or flow down the trace.\ne. Clean all excess flux and other residue from the launch area, especially between the \ntrace and ground.\nThe basic steps required to mount the end launch connector to the circuit board are as \nfollows:\n1. Fixture 140-0000-973 should be used as an aid during manual soldering. The fixture \nprotects the connector from damage during clamping and also maintains the proper \nlocation of the connector’s insulator and contact. To use the fixture, thread the \ncoupling nut on the mating end of the connector and hand tighten. This mounting \nassembly can now be held in a vice or similar clamping device, as shown in Figure 1.\n2. Position connector on the circuit board, making sure the contact pin is aligned with the \ncenter of the signal trace as shown in Figure 2. Make sure that the connector legs and \ncontact pin are held flush against the top of the circuit board, keeping the axis of the \nconnector parallel to the plane of the circuit board, as shown in Figure 3.\n3. A small amount of Teflon® insulation projects from rear mating plane of the connector, \nwhich acts as a seal when soldering the center conductor pin to the trace. Clamp the \nconnector tightly against the edge of the board. This action compresses the insulator \nseal against the board edge. This effectively creates a barrier between the inner and \nouter conductors, preventing the bridging of solder.\n4. While ensuring the connector is held in the correct position, solder the ground legs \nand/or ground posts to the top and bottom of the board prior to bonding the center pin \nto the trace.\n5. Once the connector body is properly grounded to the board, the center contact pin \ncan be bonded to the trace by using a minimal amount of solder as shown in Figure 4. \nIt is important that solder flows along the length of the exposed pin, cr eating a good \nelectrical and mechanical connection. Remove any excess solder that is not required \nfor a solid joint.\n6. Clean all flux and other residues from the trace area between the signal side ground \nlegs, as any flux present between the signal trace and ground will affect performance. \nThe completed mounting assembly should look similar to the one shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 1\nFigure 2\nFigure 3\nFigure 4\nFigure 5\n247\n© 2017 Cinch Connectors, Inc. \nccsjai 02.17Cinch Connectivity Solutions Waseca\n299 Johnson Avenue SW, Suite 100\nWaseca, MN 56093 USA  \n +1 507.833.8822\ninquiry@cinch.com\ncinch.com\nThe End Launch  connector is attached to the circuit board by inserting the \nboard edge between the legs and soldering the legs and center conductor \nto the pads on the board. For optimum high frequency preformance, the \nconnector to circuit board transtion must be ajdusted for low VSWR. To \ncompensate for the transition from coax to microstrip, trace widths “A” \nand “B” must be adjusted based on circuit board thickness. When properly \nadjusted, this technique yields a low VSWR over a wide bandwidth. \nThe tabluated dimensions “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, and “E” were determined \nexperimentally to achieve low VSWR (typically less than 1.5 up to 18 GHz). \nThe circuit board uses connectors for these tests that are double-sided \nFR4 with 1 oz. copper on both sides.
