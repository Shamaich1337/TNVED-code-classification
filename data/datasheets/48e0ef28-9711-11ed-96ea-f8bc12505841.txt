In operation this polarity needs  to be considered and adhered.\nReverse voltage can damage or destroy an Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor. This can finally lead to a malfunction.\nIf the polarity in a circuit will be switched or possibly can be reversed, the usage of a non-polar capacitor shall be applied.\nThe polarity of an Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor is for SMT V-Chip types marked like following.\nOn the top of the component the negative terminal is marked with a colored semicircle  or bar.\n1.2 Overvoltage\nAvoid any overvoltage and do not apply a continuous  overvoltage. If an overvoltage is applied to the capacitor, the leakage current can increa-\nse drastically. The applied working voltage is not allowed to exceed the rated working voltage of the specific capacitor.\n1.3 Operating Temperature\nThe capacitor shall not be operated above the operating temperature, which  is stated  within this datasheet of the specific capacitor. The\nachie vable lifetime of the capacitor is correlating to the applied temperature. In order to achie ve the maximum  lifetime, the capacitor should  be\noperated by the lowest possible temperature conditions within the application.\n1.4 Ripple Current\nThe applied ripple current shall not exceed the specified maximum  ripple current of the capacitor.\nIf a higher ripple current is applied as permitted, it can cause excessive heat generation and higher temperature inside the capacitor. This\nhappens due to pole change  effects,  if ripple current is applied to the capacitor. This can result in damage or lifetime shortage of the capacitor\nand may cause deterioration.\nElectrolytic capacitors are regularly not designed for usage in AC applications and ripple current is applied / based due to parasitic effects on\nDC signal.\nPlease see electrical specification within this datasheet for maximum  allowed ripple current.\n1.5 Char ge and Dischar ge\nFrequent  and quick  charge / dischar ge cycles may generate heat inside the capacitor. In worst  case this can cause a decrease of capacitance,\nan increase of leakage current or break down.\nApplications with rapid charge and dischar ge cycles should  be avoided. For assistance with your application please consult our technical sup-\nport.\n1.6 Vent\nOn most Aluminum Electrolytic Types types, a predetermined breaking point is given on the top of the component, which  is the so called vent.\nThe vent is there to assure a possible pressure relief and to avoid that the capacitor can explode due to internal pressure, which  can occur by\napplying reverse voltage or a too high ripple current.\nA space  of at least 3mm  above the vent is recommended, in order to assure the full function of the vent. If less space  is present the vent may-\nbe cannot operate correctly / completely.\n1.7 Storage Conditions\nThe storage conditions for a capacitor are recommended to be 5 °C up to 35 °C and less than 75 % rel. humidity.\nDo not expose the capacitor to environments  with hazardous gas, ozone, ultraviolet rays or any kind of radiation. Avoid any contact of the ca-\npacitor with direct sunshine, saltwater, spray  of water or types of oil during storage..\nIf a capacitor is stored for a long time without applying voltage or storage conditions of 35 °C or above and more than 75 % relative humidity,\nthe leakage current may increase.\nThe leakage current will return to normal level when  applying the rated voltage to the capacitor before use. If the capacitor was stored for mo-\nre than 6 months,  it is recommended to apply DC working voltage to the capacitor for 30 minutes through  a 1 kΩ protective series resistor.\nAll products  shall be used before the end of the period of 12 months  based on the product date code, if not a 100 % solderability cannot be\nguaranteed. The capacitance tolerance as specified within the datasheet is only valid on the date of delivery.\n1.8 Reflow Soldering\nThe detailed soldering instruction is given at H Soldering Specification in this datasheet.\n1.9 Hand  Soldering\nTake care that the tip of solder iron will only contact pins or leadframe of the capacitor to avoid any possible damage of the capacitor\nI Cautions and Warnings:\nThe following conditions apply to all goods  within the product series of  WCAP- ASLI\nof Würth  Elektronik eiSos GmbH  & Co.

Contamination adversely affects these\ncharacteristics.\n•Be sure to not expose the capacitors under solvent rich conditions or keep capacitors inside a closed container. In addition, please dry the\nsolvents  on the PCB and the capacitor sufficiently with an air knife (temperature should  be less than the maximum  rated category tempe-\nrature of the capacitor) for 10 minutes.\n•Capacitors can be characteristically and catastrophically damaged by halogen ions, particularly by chlorine ions. The degree of the dama-\nge mainly depends  upon the characteristics of the electrolyte and rubber seal material. When  halogen ions come into contact with the in-\nside of the capacitors, the foil may corrode, when  a voltage is applied. This corrosion causes an extremely high leakage current, which  re-\nsults in venting and an open circuit defect.\nAll other  cleaning processes and cleaning agents  are not approved by Würth  Elektronik eiSos. All cleaning methods  need to be tested and vali-\ndated by the customer.\n1.11 Adhesives and Coating Materials\nThe usage of any adhesive or coating material, which  is containing halogenated solvents,  is not allowed.\nBefore applying adhesives or coating materials, make sure that the following points  are fulfilled:\n•Take care that the surface and capacitor is dry and clean  before applying adhesive or coating, to avoid any contamination with flux residu-\nes or cleaning solvents.\n•Assure that no flux residue or spot is left between  the rubber seal material of the capacitor and the PCB.\n•Do not fully cover the entire rubber seal surface with adhesive, coating or molding materials. Other wise the covering of the full rubber seal\nsurface may restrain the natural diffusion of hydrogen gas. Block  maximum  80% of the sealed section of a capacitor.\n•If the used adhesive, coating or molding material is containing halogen ions in a large amount,  the halogen ions can diffuse and creep  into\nthe capacitor and can damage the capacitor. Both above explained circumstances can result in serious failures.\n•Follow the specified heating and curing instructions given by supplier of the used adhesive or coating material. Avoid excessive pressure\nor heat on the capacitor by applying coating or adhesive.•Take care that hardening of adhesive, coating material was correctly done, so that no solvents  do remain.\n•Be aware, that used solvents  within adhesive and coating materials can damage the sleeve of the capacitor and can result in changes of\nthe appearance of the sleeve (color, shine and marking).\n1.12 Mechanical Stress  on lead wire and terminal\nDo not stress  the capacitor with the following actions:\n•Applying any excessive force to the lead wire or terminal.\n•Move or turn the capacitor after soldering to the PCB.\n•Bending pins after soldering.\n•Carrying the PCB by picking  / holding the board  via a capacitor.\n1.13 Operation and Usage of the Capacitor\nIn operation and usage take care about  the following points.\nDo not use the capacitor within the following environmental conditions:\n•Environment with high mechanical stress  / shocks  or vibration (please see this specific datasheet for permitted limits).\n•Environment with high amount  of damp  condensation, water or types of oil.\n•Direct sunlight, ozone, any kind of radiation or ultraviolet rays.\n•Toxic gases (e.g. ammonium, chlorine and compounds,  bromine and compounds,  hydrogen sulfide, sulfuric acid).\nUser should  never touch  the terminals of the capacitor directly.\nAvoid short circuit between  terminals with any kind of conductive material (e.g. metal, fluid, acid, alkaline solution).\n1.14 Main tenance\nFor industrial applications it is recommended to perform periodic inspections. Power  supplies shall be turned off before inspection to dischar-\nge the capacitor. Check  the following points  in case of an inspection:\n•Visual inspection of the capacitor to see, if the vent operated for pressure relief and if any leakage of electrolyte has taken place. \n•Measurement of electrical characteristics of the capacitor (according to datasheet, especially leakage current, capacitance and dissipati-\non factor).\nIn case of deviation or failure according to the specified characteristics,  take care to start appropriate actions (e.g. replacement of capacitor).\nI Cautions and Warnings  (2):\nThe following conditions apply to all goods  within the product series of  WCAP- ASLI\nof Würth  Elektronik eiSos GmbH  & Co.

In case of vent operation gas becomes visi-\nble, when  the component is in operation. If so, directly turn off the application and disconnect  it from the power  source. If the application will\nnot be turned off, a possible short circuit of capacitor or a short circuit due to bridging  of liquefied gas can possibly damage the circuit and in\nworst  case the application may be dramatically damaged.\nDo not stay or position body or face above or in direction of the vent, because in the event  of any vent operation, the releasing gas temperature\nmay have over 100 °C.\nIn case of contact with the electrolyte on skin, wash  the skin immediately with soap and water. If the eyes will get in contact with the releasing\ngas, immediately wash  the eyes with water. Whether the gas was inhaled, directly use gargle.\n1.16 Disposal\nPlease contact your local responsible or organization for proper disposal of capacitor.\nAlso take care to be compliant in order to your local governmental law and restrictions. In case incineration, it should  be done with more than\n800 °C. Lower  temperatures at incineration can result in toxic gases (e.g. chlorine).
