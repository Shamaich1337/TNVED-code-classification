The amplifier \ndoes not require any ne gative supplies for operation and \ncan be biased from positive supply rails from 3.3 to 5  V.  \nThe device is housed in a lead -free/green/RoHS -compliant \nindustry -standard 2x2 mm package.  \n \nThe TQP3M9036 is internally matched using a high-\nperformance  E-pHEMT pr ocess and only requires 4 \nexternal components for operation from a single positive \nsupply: an external RF choke and blocking/bypass \ncapacitors.  The low noise amplifier contains an internal \nactive bias to maintain high performance over temperature \nand inte grates a shut -down biasing capability for TDD \napplications.  \n \nThe T QP3M9036 covers the 50−2000 M Hz frequency band \nand is targeted for wireless infrastructure.  The  LNA is pin \ncompatible with the high -band, 1 500−2700 MHz \nTQP3M9037.  \nFunctional Block Diagram  \n \n \nTop View  Key Features  \n \n• 50−2000  MHz Operational Bandwidth  \n• Ultra -low noise figure, 0.45 dB NF at 900 MHz  \n• High gain, 19 .8 dB Gain at 900 MHz  \n• High linearity, +3 6 dBm Output IP3  \n• High input power ruggedness, >22 dBm P IN, MAX  \n• Unconditionally stable  \n• Integrated on -chip matching, 50 ohm in/out  \n• Integrated active bias  \n• Integrated shutdown control pin  \n• 3-5 V positive supply voltage: −Vgg not required  \n• Pin compatible with high -band TQP3M9037  \nOrdering Information  \n Part No.  Description  \nTQP3M9036  Ultra low noise, High IP3 LNA  \nTQP3M9036−PCB  100−2000 MHz Evaluation Board  \nStandard T/R size = 2500 pieces on a 7” reel \n \nBackside Paddle - RF/DC GNDPin 1 Reference Mark\n8\n7\n6\n51\n2\n3\n4NC\nRF Out\nShut Down\nNCNC\nRF In\nNC\nNC\n \n   \n  TQP3M9036  \nUltra -Low Noise, High Linearity LNA  \nData sheet, November 27 , 201 8 | Subject to change without notice  2 of 12 www.qorvo.com    \n®  \n  Absolute Maximum Ratings  \n Parameter  Rating  \nStorage Temperature  −65 to 150 \u2009°C \nRF Input Power, CW, 50\u2009Ω, T=+25 \u2009°C +22\u2009dBm \nDevice  Voltage (V DD) +7\u2009V \nOperation of this device outside the parameter ranges given  \nabove may cause permanent damage.
