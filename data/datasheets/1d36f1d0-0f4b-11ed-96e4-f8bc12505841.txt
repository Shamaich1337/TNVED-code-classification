The on-chip, low noise \ninstrumentation amplifier means that signals of small ampli-\ntude can be interfaced directly to the ADC. With a gain  setting of 64, the rms noise is 40 nV when the update rate  \nequals 4.17 Hz.  \nThe devices contain a precision low noise, low drift internal \nband gap reference and can accept an external differential reference. Other on-chip features include programmable \nexcitation current sources, burnout currents, and a bias voltage \ngenerator. The bias voltage generator sets the common-mode \nvoltage of a channel to AV\nDD/2.  \nThe devices can be operated with either the internal clock or an \nexternal clock. The output data rate from the parts is software-\nprogrammable and can be varied from 4.17 Hz to 470 Hz.  \nThe parts operate with a power supply from 2.7 V to 5.25 V . \nThey consume a current of 400 μA typical and are housed in a \n16-lead TSSOP package. \n \n \n \nAD7792/AD7793 \n \nRev.

At the 19. 6 Hz and 39.2 Hz up date rates, the INL, power supply rejectio n (PSR), common-mode rejection (CMR), and normal \nmode rejection (NMR) do not meet the data sheet specification if the voltage on the AIN(+) or AIN(−) pins exceed AV DD − 16 V typically. When this voltage is exceeded, \nthe INL, for example, is reduced to 18 ppm of FS typically while the PSR is reduced to 69 dB typically. Therefore, for guarante ed performance at these update rates, the \nabsolute voltage on the analog input pins needs to be below AV DD − 1.6 V. \n2 Specification is not production tested, but is supported  by characterization data at initial product release. \n3 Following a calibration, this error is in the order of the noise for the programmed gain an d update rate selected. \n4 Recalibration at any temper ature removes these errors. \n5 Full-scale error applies to both positive and negative full-scale and applies at the factory calibration conditions (AV DD = 4 V, gain = 1, T A = 25°C). \n6 FS[3:0] are the four bits used in the mode register to select the output word rate. \n7 Digital inputs equal to DV DD or GND with excitation currents an d bias voltage generator disabled. \n \n \n \n \nAD7792/AD7793 \n \nRev.

All input signals are specified with t R = t F = 5 ns (10% to 90% of DV DD) and timed from a voltage level of 1.6 V. \n2 See Figure 3 and Figure 4. \n3 These numbers are measured with the load ci rcuit shown in Figure 2 and defined as the time required for the  output to cross th e V OL or V OH limits. \n4 SCLK active edge is falling edge of SCLK. \n5 These numbers are derived from the measured time taken by the data output to change 0.5 V when loaded with the circuit shown i n Figure 2. The measured number \nis then extrapolated back to remove the effects of charging or discharging the 50 pF capacitor. This means that the times quote d in the timing characteristics are the \ntrue bus relinquish times of the part and, as such, are independent of external bus loading capacitances. \n6 RDY  returns high after a read of the ADC. In single conversion mode and continuous conversion mode, the same data can be read agai n, if required, while RDY  is high, \nalthough care should be taken to ensure that subsequent reads do not occur close to the next output update.

Pin Configuration \n \nTable 4. Pin Function Descriptions \nPin No.  Mnemonic  Description \n1  SCLK  Serial Clock Input. This serial cloc k input is for data transfers to and from the ADC. The SCLK has a Schmitt-\ntriggered input, making the interface suitable for opto-isolated applications. The serial clock can be \ncontinuous with all data transmitted in a continuous train of pulses. Alternatively, it can be a noncontinuous \nclock with the information being transmitted to or from the ADC in smaller batches of data.  \n2  CLK  Clock In/Clock Out. The internal clock can be made available at this pin. Alternatively, the internal clock can be disabled, and the ADC can be driven by an external clock. This allows several AD Cs to be driven from a \ncommon clock, allowing simultaneous conversions to be performed.  \n3  CS Chip Select Input. This is an active low logic input used to select the ADC. CS can be used to select the ADC \nin systems with more than one device on the serial bus or as a frame synchronization signal in communicating \nwith the device. CS can be hardwired low, allowing the ADC to operate in 3-wire mode with SCLK, DIN, and \nDOUT used to interface with the device. \n4  IOUT1  Output of Internal Excitation Current Source. The internal  excitation current source can be made available at \nthis pin. The excitation current source is programma ble so that the current can be 10 μA, 210 μA, or 1 mA. \nEither IEXC1 or IEXC2 can be switched to this output. \n5  AIN1(+)  Analog Input. AIN1(+) is the posit ive terminal of the differential analog input pair AIN1(+)/AIN1( −). \n6  AIN1( −)  Analog Input. AIN1( −) is the negative terminal of the differ ential analog input pair AIN1(+)/AIN1( −). \n7  AIN2(+)  Analog Input. AIN2(+) is the posit ive terminal of the differential analog input pair AIN2(+)/AIN2( −). \n8  AIN2( −)  Analog Input. AIN2( −) is the negative terminal of the differ ential analog input pair AIN2(+)/AIN2( −).  \n9  REFIN(+)/AIN3(+)  Positive Reference Input/Analog Input. An extern al reference can be applied between REFIN(+) and \nREFIN( −). REFIN(+) can lie anywhere between AV DD and GND + 0.1 V. The nominal reference voltage  \nREFIN(+) − REFIN( −) is 2.5 V, but the part functions with a reference from 0.1 V to AV DD. Alternatively, this pin \ncan function as AIN3(+) where AIN3(+) is the positiv e terminal of the differential analog input pair \nAIN3(+)/AIN3( −).  \n10  REFIN( −)/AIN3(− )  Negative Reference Input/Analog Input. REFIN( −) is the negative reference input for REFIN. This reference \ninput can lie anywhere between GND and AV DD − 0.1 V. This pin also functions as AIN3( −), which is the \nnegative terminal of the differenti al analog input pair AIN3(+)/AIN3( −).  \n11  IOUT2  Output of Internal Excitation Current Source. The internal  excitation current source can be made available at \nthis pin. The excitation current source is programma ble so that the current can be 10 μA, 210 μA, or 1 mA. \nEither IEXC1 or IEXC2 can be switched to this output. \n12  GND  Ground Reference Point.  \n13  AV DD Supply Voltage, 2.7 V to 5.25 V.  \n14  DV DD Digital Interface Supply Voltage. The logic levels for the serial interface pins are related to this supply, which \nis between 2.7 V and 5.25 V. The DV DD voltage is independent of the voltage on AV DD; therefore, AV DD can \nequal 5 V with DV DD at 3 V or vice versa. \n   \nAD7792/AD7793 \n \nRev.

It functions as a serial data output \npin to access the output shift register of the ADC. The o utput shift register can contain data from any of the \non-chip data or control registers. In addition, DOUT/ RDY  operates as a data ready pin, going low to indicate \nthe completion of a conversion. If the data is not re ad after the conversion, the pin goes high before the \nnext update occurs.  \nThe DOUT/ RDY  falling edge can be used as an interrupt to a pr ocessor, indicating that valid data is available. \nWith an external serial clock, th e data can be read using the DOUT/ RDY  pin. With CS low, the data/control \nword information is placed on the DOUT/ RDY  pin on the SCLK falling edge and is valid on the SCLK  \nrising edge.  \n16  DIN  Serial Data Input. This serial  data input is to the input shift register on  the ADC. Data in this shift register is \ntransferred to the control registers within the ADC; the register selection bits of the communications \nregister identify the appropriate register.  \n \n \n AD7792/AD7793\n \nRev.

B | Page 14 of 32 ON-CHIP REGISTERS \nThe ADC is controlled and configured via a number of on-chip \nregisters, which are described on the following pages. In the following descriptions, set implies a Logic 1 state and cleared  \nimplies a Logic 0 state, unless otherwise stated. \nCOMMUNICATIONS REGISTER \nRS2, RS1, RS0 = 0, 0, 0  \nThe communications register is an 8-bit write-only register. All \ncommunications to the part must start with a write operation to \nthe communications register. The data written to the communications register determines whether the next operation is a read or write operation, and to which register this operation takes place. For read or write operations, once the subsequent read or write operation to the selected register is complete, the interface returns to where it expects a write operation to the communications register. This is the default state of the interface and, on power-up or after a reset, the ADC is in this default state waiting for a write operation to the \ncommunications register. In situations where the interface \nsequence is lost, a write operation of at least 32 serial clock cycles with DIN high returns the ADC to this default state by resetting the entire part. \nTable 11  outlines the bit designations \nfor the communications register. CR0 through CR7 indicate the \nbit location, CR denoting the bits are in the communications \nregister. CR7 denotes the first bit of the data stream. The number in parentheses indicates the power-on/reset default \nstatus of that bit. \n \nCR7  CR6  CR5  CR4  CR3  CR2  CR1  CR0  \nWEN (0)  R/W(0)  RS2(0)  RS1(0)  RS0(0)  CREAD(0)  0(0)  0(0)  \n \nTable 11. Communications Register Bit Designations \nBit Location  Bit Name  Description  \nCR7  WEN Write Enable Bit. A 0 must be written to this bit so  that the write to the commu nications register actually \noccurs. If a 1 is the first bit written, the part does not cloc k on to subsequent bits in the register. It stays at this \nbit location until a 0 is written to th is bit. Once a 0 is written to the WEN  bit, the next seven bits are loaded to \nthe communications register.  \nCR6  R/W A 0 in this bit location indicates that the next operatio n is a write to a specified register. A 1 in this position \nindicates that the next operation is a read from the designated register.  \nCR5 to CR3  RS2 to \nRS0  Register Address Bits. These address bits are used to select which of the ADC’s registers are being selected during this serial interface communication. See \nTable 12 .  \nCR2  CREAD  Continuous Read of the Data Register. When this bit is se t to 1 (and the data register  is selected), the serial \ninterface is configured so that the data register can be continuously read. For example, the contents of the \ndata register are placed on the DOUT pin automa tically when the SCLK pulses are applied after the RDY  pin \ngoes low to indicate that a conversion is complete. The communications register does not have to be written to for data reads. To enable continuous read mode, the instruction 01011100 must be written to the communications register. To exit the continuous read  mode, the instruction 01011000 must be written to the \ncommunications register while the \nRDY  pin is low. While in continuous re ad mode, the ADC monitors activity \non the DIN line so that it can receive the instruction to  exit continuous read mode. Additionally, a reset occurs \nif 32 consecutive 1s are seen on DIN. Therefore, DIN sh ould be held low in continuous read mode until an \ninstruction is to be written to the device.  \nCR1 to CR0  0  These bits must be programmed to Logic 0 for correct operation.  \n \nTable 12.

To access the ADC status register, the user must write to the communication s register, \nselect the next operation to be a read, and load Bit RS2, Bit RS1, and Bit RS0 with 0. Table 13  outlines the bit designations for the status \nregister. SR0 through SR7 indicate the bit locations, and SR denotes that the bits are in the status register.

It is also set when the part is \nplaced in power-down mode. The end of a conversion is indicated by the DOUT/ RDY  pin also. This pin can \nbe used as an alternative to the status regist er for monitoring the ADC for conversion data.  \nSR6  ERR  ADC Error Bit. This bit is written to at the same time as the RDY  bit.

This register is used to se lect the \noperating mode, update rate, and clock source. Table 14  outlines the bit designations for the mode register. MR0 through MR15 indicate \nthe bit locations, MR denoting the bits are in the mode register. MR15 denotes the first bit of the data stream. The number in parentheses \nindicates the power-on/reset default status of that bit.

Either an on-chip 64 kHz clock can be \nused, or an external clock can be used. The ability to override using an external clock allows several \nAD7792/AD7793 devices to be synchronized.

Operating Modes \nMD2  MD1  MD0  Mode  \n0  0  0  Continuous Conversion Mode (Default).  \nIn continuous conversion mode, the ADC continuously pe rforms conversions and places the result in the data \nregister. RDY  goes low when a conversion is complete. The user can read these conversions by placing the device in \ncontinuous read mode, whereby the conversions are automa tically placed on the DOUT line when SCLK pulses are \napplied. Alternatively, the user can instruct the ADC to  output the conversion by writing to the communications \nregister. After power-on, a channel change, or a write to the mode, configuration, or IO registers, the first conversion \nis available after a period of 2/f ADC. Subsequent conversions are available at a frequency of f ADC. \n0  0  1  Single Conversion Mode.  When single conversion mode is selected, the ADC powers up and performs a single conversion. The oscillator \nrequires 1 ms to power up and settle. The ADC then performs the conversion, which takes a time of 2/f\nADC.

The offset register is used in conjunction with its associated full-scale register to form a register pair. The power-on-reset value is \nautomatically overwritten if an internal or system zero-scale \ncalibration is initiated by the user. The offset register is a read/write register. However, the AD7792/AD7793 must be  in idle mode or power-down mode when writing to the  \noffset register.

The full-scale register holds the \nfull-scale calibration coefficient for the ADC. The AD7792/AD7793 have 3 full-scale registers, each channel having a dedicated full-scale register. The full-scale registers are read/write registers; however, when writing to the full-scale \nregisters, the ADC must be placed in power-down mode or idle \nmode. These registers are configured on power-on with factory-calibrated full-scale calibration coefficients, the calibration being performed at gain = 1. Therefore, every device has \ndifferent default coefficients. The coefficients are different \ndepending on whether the internal reference or an external \nreference is selected. The default value is automatically \noverwritten if an internal or system full-scale calibration is \ninitiated by the user, or the full-scale register is written to.  \n \nAD7792/AD7793 \n \nRev.

The device can be operated with the internal 1.17 V reference, or an external reference can be used. \nFigure 12  shows \nthe basic connections required to operate the part.  \n04855-012DOUT/RD Y\nDIN\nSCLK\nCS\nDVDDSERIAL\nINTERFACE\nAND\nCONTROL\nLOGICΣ-Δ\nADC\nAD7792/AD7793AIN2(+)\nREFIN(+)\nREFIN(–)AIN2(–)AVDD\nGNDMUXBAND GAP\nREFERENCE\nINTERNAL\nCLOCK\nCLKGNDGND AVDD\nAVDDIN-AMP BUFREFIN(+) REFIN(–)VBIAS\nAIN1(+)\nAIN1(–)\nRRTHERMOCOUPLE\nJUNCTION\nC\nRREF\nIOUT2\n \nFigure 12. Basic Connection Diagram \nThe output rate of the AD7792/AD7793 (f ADC) is user-program-\nmable. The allowable update rates, along with their corresponding settling times, are listed in \nTable 16 . Normal mode rejection is \nthe major function of the digital filter. Simultaneous 50 Hz and 60 Hz rejection is optimized when the update rate equals 16.7 Hz or less as notches are placed at both 50 Hz and 60 Hz \nwith these update rates. See \nFigure 14 . \nThe AD7792/AD7793 use slightly different filter types, \ndepending on the output update rate so that the rejection of quantization noise and device noise is optimized. When the \nupdate rate is from 4.17 Hz to 12.5 Hz, a Sinc3 filter, along with \nan averaging filter, is used. When the update rate is from 16.7 Hz to 39 Hz, a modified Sinc3 filter is used. This filter provides simultaneous 50 Hz/60 Hz rejection when the update rate equals 16.7 Hz. A Sinc4 filter is used when the update rate \nis from 50 Hz to 242 Hz. Finally, an integrate-only filter is used \nwhen the update rate equals 470 Hz.  \nFigure 13  to Figure 16  show the frequency response of the \ndifferent filter types for several update rates. 0\n–20\n–40\n–60\n–80\n–100\n0 120 100 80 60 40 20\n04855-018\nFREQUENCY (Hz)(dB)\n \nFigure 13.

Filter Response at 470 Hz Update Rate \nDIGITAL INTERFACE  \nThe programmable functions of the AD7792/AD7793 are \ncontrolled using a set of on-chip registers. Data is written to \nthese registers via the serial interface of the device; read access \nto the on-chip registers is also provided by this interface. All \ncommunications with the device must start with a write to the communications register. After power-on or reset, the device expects a write to its communications register. The data written to this register determines whether the next operation is a read operation or a write operation and determines to which register \nthis read or write operation occurs. Therefore, write access to \nany of the other registers on the part begins with a write \noperation to the communications register followed by a write to the selected register. A read operation from any other register (except when continuous read mode is selected) starts with a \nwrite to the communications register followed by a read \noperation from the selected register.  \nThe serial interfaces of the AD7792/AD7793 consist of four \nsignals: CS, DIN, SCLK, and DOUT/ RDY . The DIN line is used \nto transfer data into the on-chip registers, and DOUT/ RDY  is \nused for accessing from the on-chip registers. SCLK is the serial \nclock input for the device, and all data transfers (either on DIN \nor DOUT/ RDY ) occur with respect to the SCLK signal. The \nDOUT/ RDY  pin operates as a data-ready signal also, the line \ngoing low when a new data-word is available in the output \nregister. It is reset high when a read operation from the data register is complete. It also goes high prior to the updating of the data register to indicate when not to read from the device, to ensure that a data read is not attempted while the register is \nbeing updated. \nCS is used to select a device. It can be used to \ndecode the AD7792/AD7793 in systems where several \ncomponents are connected to the serial bus.  Figure 3  and Figure 4  show timing diagrams for interfacing to \nthe AD7792/AD7793 with CS being used to decode the part. \nFigure 3  shows the timing for a read operation from the \nAD7792/AD7793 output shift register, and Figure 4 shows the timing for a write operation to the input shift register. It is possible to read the same word from the data register several \ntimes, even though the DOUT/\nRDY  line returns high after the \nfirst read operation. However, care must be taken to ensure that \nthe read operations have been completed before the next output \nupdate occurs. In continuous read mode, the data register can \nbe read only once.  \nThe serial interface can operate in 3-wire mode by tying CS low. \nIn this case, the SCLK, DIN, and DOUT/ RDY  lines are used  \nto communicate with the AD7792/AD7793. The end of the \nconversion can be monitored using the RDY  bit in the status \nregister. This scheme is suitable for interfacing to microcon-trollers. If \nCS is required as a decoding signal, it can be \ngenerated from a port pin. For microcontroller interfaces, it is \nrecommended that SCLK idle high between data transfers.  \nThe AD7792/AD7793 can be operated with CS being used as a \nframe synchronization signal. This scheme is useful for DSP \ninterfaces. In this case, the first bit (MSB) is effectively clocked \nout by CS, because CS would normally occur after the falling \nedge of SCLK in DSPs. The SCLK can continue to run between \ndata transfers, provided the timing numbers are obeyed.  \nThe serial interface can be reset by writing a series of 1s on the \nDIN input. If a Logic 1 is written to the AD7792/AD7793 line for at least 32 serial clock cycles, the serial interface is reset. This ensures that the interface can be reset to a known state if \nthe interface gets lost due to a software error or some glitch in \nthe system. Reset returns the interface to the state in which it is expecting a write to the communications register. This opera-tion resets the contents of all registers to their power-on values. Following a reset, the user should allow a period of 500 μs \nbefore addressing the serial interface. \nThe AD7792/AD7793 can be configured to continuously \nconvert or to perform a single conversion. See Figure 17  \nthrough Figure 19 . \n \nAD7792/AD7793 \n \nRev. B | Page 22 of 32 Single Conversion Mode  \nIn single conversion mode, the AD7792/AD7793 are placed in \nshutdown mode between conversions. When a single conver-\nsion is initiated by setting MD2, MD1, MD0 to 0, 0, 1 in the \nmode register, the AD7792/AD7793 power up, perform a single conversion, and then return to shutdown mode. The on-chip oscillator requires 1 ms to power up. A conversion requires a \ntime period of 2 × t\nADC. DOUT/ RDY  goes low to indicate the \ncompletion of a conversion. When the data-word has been read from the data register, DOUT/\nRDY  goes high. If CS is low, \nDOUT/ RDY  remains high until another conversion is initiated \nand completed. The data register can be read several times, if required, even when DOUT/\nRDY  has gone high.  Continuous Conversion Mode  \nThis is the default power-up mode. The AD7792/AD7793 continuously converts, the \nRDY  pin in the status register going \nlow each time a conversion is completed. If CS is low, the \nDOUT/ RDY  line also goes low when a conversion is complete. \nTo read a conversion, the user writes to the communications \nregister indicating that the next operation is a read of the data \nregister. The digital conversion is placed on the DOUT/ RDY  \npin as soon as SCLK pulses are applied to the ADC. DOUT/\nRDY  returns high when the conversion is read. The \nuser can read this register additional times, if required. \nHowever, the user must ensure that the data register is not being \naccessed at the completion of the next conversion, otherwise the \nnew conversion word is lost. \n \n0x58\n04855-015DIN 0x08 0x200A\nDATA\nSCLKDOUT/RDYCS\n \nFigure 17.

B | Page 23 of 32 Continuous Read  \nRather than write to the communications register each time a \nconversion is complete to access the data, the AD7792/AD7793 \ncan be configured so that the conversions are placed on the \nDOUT/ RDY  line automatically. By writing 01011100 to the \ncommunications register, the user needs only to apply the \nappropriate number of SCLK cycles to the ADC, and the 16/24-\nbit word is automatically placed on the DOUT/ RDY  line when a \nconversion is complete. The AD C should be configured for \ncontinuous conversion mode.  \nWhen DOUT/ RDY  goes low to indicate the end of a conver-\nsion, sufficient SCLK cycles must be applied to the ADC, and the data conversion is placed on the DOUT/\nRDY  line. When \nthe conversion is read, DOUT/ RDY  returns high until the next \nconversion is available. In this mode, the data can be read only \nonce. In addition, the user must ensure that the data-word is read before the next conversion is complete. If the user has not read the conversion before the completion of the next conversion, or if insufficient serial clocks are applied to the AD7792/AD7793 to read the word, the serial output register is \nreset when the next conversion is completed, and the new \nconversion is placed in the output serial register.  \nTo exit the continuous read mode, the instruction 01011000 \nmust be written to the communications register while the \nDOUT/ RDY  pin is low. While in the continuous read mode, the \nADC monitors activity on the DIN line so that it can receive the \ninstruction to exit the continuous read mode. Additionally, a reset occurs if 32 consecutive 1s are seen on DIN. Therefore, DIN should be held low in continuous read mode until an instruction is written to the device. \n \n04855-017DIN\nSCLKDOUT/RDYCS\n0x5C\nDATA DATA DATA\n \nFigure 19. Continuous Read \nAD7792/AD7793 \n \nRev. B | Page 24 of 32 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nANALOG INPUT CHANNEL \nThe AD7792/AD7793 have three differential analog input \nchannels. These are connected to the on-chip buffer amplifier when the device is operated in buffered mode and directly to \nthe modulator when the device is operated in unbuffered mode. In buffered mode (the BUF bit in the mode register is set to 1), the input channel feeds into a high impedance input stage of the buffer amplifier. Therefore, the input can tolerate significant source impedances and is tailored for direct connection to \nexternal resistive-type sensors, such as strain gauges or \nresistance temperature detectors (RTDs).  \nWhen BUF = 0, the part is operated in unbuffered mode.  This results in a higher analog input current. Note that this unbuffered input path provides a dynamic load to the driving \nsource. Therefore, resistor/capacitor combinations on the input \npins can cause gain errors, depending on the output impedance of the source that is driving the ADC input. \nTable 19  shows the \nallowable external resistance/capacitance values for unbuffered mode such that no gain error at the 20-bit level is introduced.  \nTable 19. External R-C Combination for No 20-Bit Gain Error \nC (pF)  R (Ω)  \n50  9 k  \n100  6 k  \n500  1.5 k \n1000  900  \n5000  200  \nThe AD7792/AD7793 can be operated in unbuffered mode only \nwhen the gain equals 1 or 2. At higher gains, the buffer is auto-\nmatically enabled. The absolute input voltage range in buffered mode is restricted to a range between GND + 100 mV and  AV\nDD – 100 mV . When the gain is set to 4 or higher, the in-amp \nis enabled. The absolute input voltage range when the in-amp is active is restricted to a range between GND + 300 mV and \nAV\nDD − 1.1 V . Take care in setting up the common-mode \nvoltage so that these limits are not exceeded to avoid \ndegradation in linearity and noise performance.  \nThe absolute input voltage in unbuffered mode includes the \nrange between GND – 30 mV and AV DD + 30 mV as a result of \nbeing unbuffered. The negative absolute input voltage limit does allow the possibility of monitoring small true bipolar signals with respect to GND. \nINSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER \nAmplifying the analog input signal by a gain of 1 or 2 is performed digitally within the AD7792/AD7793. However, when the gain equals 4 or higher, the output from the buffer is applied to the input of the on-chip instrumentation amplifier. \nThis low noise in-amp means that signals of small amplitude \ncan be gained within the AD7792/AD7793 while still maintaining excellent noise performance.  For example, when the gain is set to 64, the rms noise is 40 nV typically, which is equivalent to 21 bits effective resolution or 18.5 bits peak-to-peak resolution.  \nThe AD7792/AD7793 can be programmed to have a gain of 1, \n2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 using Bit G2 to Bit G0 in the configu-\nration register. Therefore, with an external 2.5 V reference, the unipolar ranges are from 0 mV to 20 mV to 0 V to 2.5 V while the bipolar ranges are from ±20 mV to ±2.5 V . When the  in-amp is active (gain ≥ 4), the common-mode voltage (AIN(+) \n+ AIN(–))/2 must be greater than or equal to 0.5 V .  \nIf the AD7792/AD7793 are operated with an external reference \nthat has a value equal to AV DD, the analog input signal must be \nlimited to 90% of V REF/gain when the in-amp is active, for \ncorrect operation.  \nBIPOLAR/UNIPOLAR CONFIGURATION \nThe analog input to the AD7792/AD7793 can accept either \nunipolar or bipolar input voltage ranges. A bipolar input range \ndoes not imply that the part can tolerate negative voltages with respect to system GND. Unipolar and bipolar signals on the AIN(+) input are referenced to the voltage on the AIN(–) input. For example, if AIN(−) is 2.5 V , and the ADC is configured for \nunipolar mode and a gain of 1, the input voltage range on the \nAIN(+) pin is 2.5 V to 5 V .  \nIf the ADC is configured for bipolar mode, the analog input \nrange on the AIN(+) input is 0 V to 5 V . The bipolar/unipolar \noption is chosen by programming the U/ B bit in the configura-\ntion register.  \nDATA OUTPUT CODING  \nWhen the ADC is configured for unipolar operation, the output \ncode is natural (straight) binary with a zero differential input \nvoltage resulting in a code of 00...00, a midscale voltage resulting in a code of 100...000, and a full-scale input voltage resulting in a code of 111...111. The output code for any analog input voltage can be represented as  \nCode  = (2N × AIN × GAIN) /VREF \nWhen the ADC is configured for bipolar operation, the output code is offset binary with a negative full-scale voltage resulting in a code of 000...000, a zero differential input voltage resulting in a code of 100...000, and a positive full-scale input voltage resulting in a code of 111...111. The output code for any analog input voltage can be represented as  \nCode  = 2N – 1 × [( AIN × GAIN  /VREF) + 1] \nwhere AIN is the analog input voltage, GAIN  is the in-amp \nsetting (1 to 128), and N = 16 for the AD7792 and N = 24 for \nthe AD7793. \n AD7792/AD7793\n \nRev. B | Page 25 of 32 BURNOUT CURRENTS \nThe AD7792/AD7793 contain two 100 nA constant current \ngenerators, one sourcing current from AV DD to AIN(+) and one \nsinking current from AIN(–) to GND. The currents are \nswitched to the selected analog input pair. Both currents are \neither on or off, depending on the burnout current enable (BO) bit in the configuration register. These currents can be used to verify that an external transducer is still operational before attempting to take measurements on that channel. Once the \nburnout currents are turned on, they flow in the external \ntransducer circuit, and a measurement of the input voltage on the analog input channel can be taken. If the resultant voltage \nmeasured is full scale, the user needs to verify why this is the \ncase. A full-scale reading could mean that the front-end sensor \nis open circuit. It could also mean that the front-end sensor is \noverloaded and is justified in outputting full scale, or the reference may be absent, thus clamping the data to all 1s. \nWhen reading all 1s from the output, the user needs to check these three cases before making a judgment. If the voltage measured is 0 V , it may indicate that the transducer has short \ncircuited. For normal operation, these burnout currents are \nturned off by writing a 0 to the BO bit in the configuration register. The current sources work over the normal absolute input voltage range specifications with buffers on. \nEXCITATION CURRENTS \nThe AD7792/AD7793 also contain two matched, software configurable, constant current sources that can be programmed to equal 10 μA, 210 μA, or 1 mA. Both source currents from the AV\nDD are directed to either the IOUT1 or IOUT2 pin of the \ndevice. These current sources are controlled via bits in the IO \nregister. The configuration bits enable the current sources, \ndirect the current sources to IOUT1 or IOUT2, and select the value of the current. These current sources can be used to excite external resistive bridge or RTD sensors. \nBIAS VOLTAGE GENERATOR \nA bias voltage generator is included on the AD7792/AD7793. This biases the negative terminal of the selected input channel to AV\nDD/2. It is useful in thermocouple applications, because the \nvoltage generated by the thermocouple must be biased about some dc voltage if the gain is greater than 2. This is necessary \nbecause the instrumentation amplifier requires headroom to \nensure that signals close to GND or AV\nDD are converted \naccurately. \nThe bias voltage generator is controlled using the VBIAS1 and VBIAS0 bits in conjunction with the boost bit in the configura-\ntion register. The power-up time of the bias voltage generator is \ndependent on the load capacitance. To accommodate higher load capacitances, the AD7792/AD7793 have a boost bit. When this bit is set to 1, the current consumed by the bias voltage generator increases, so that the power-up time is considerably \nreduced. \nFigure 10  shows the power-up time when boost equals \n0 and 1 for different load capacitances.  The current consumption of the AD7792/AD7793 increases by \n40 μA when the bias voltage generator is enabled, and boost equals 0. With the boost function enabled, the current consumption increases by 250 μA. \nREFERENCE \nThe AD7792/AD7793 have an embedded 1.17 V reference that can be used to supply the ADC, or an external reference can be applied. The embedded reference is a low noise, low drift reference, the drift being 4 ppm/°C typically. For external \nreferences, the ADC has a fully differential input capability for \nthe channel. The reference source for the AD7792/AD7793 is selected using the REFSEL bit in the configuration register. When the internal reference is selected, it is internally con-nected to the modulator. It is not available on the REFIN pins. \nThe common-mode range for these differential inputs is from GND to AV\nDD. The reference input is unbuffered; therefore, \nexcessive R-C source impedances introduce gain errors. The reference voltage REFIN (REFIN(+) − REFIN(−)) is 2.5 V nominal, but the AD7792/AD7793 are functional with reference voltages from 0.1 V to AV\nDD. In applications where the exci-\ntation (voltage or current) for the transducer on the analog input also drives the reference voltage for the part, the effect of the low frequency noise in the excitation source is removed because the application is ratiometric. If the AD7792/AD7793 are used in a nonratiometric application, a low noise reference \nshould be used. \nRecommended 2.5 V reference voltage sources for the AD7792/ \nAD7793 include the ADR381 and ADR391, which are low noise, low power references. Also note that the reference inputs provide a high impedance, dynamic load. Because the input \nimpedance of each reference input is dynamic, resistor/capacitor \ncombinations on these inputs can cause dc gain errors, depending on the output impedance of the source that is driving the reference inputs. \nReference voltage sources like those recommended above (such \nas ADR391) typically have low output impedances and are, \ntherefore, tolerant to having decoupling capacitors on REFIN(+) without introducing gain errors in the system. Deriving the reference input voltage across an external resistor means that the reference input sees a significant external source impedance. External decoupling on the REFIN pins is not recommended in \nthis type of circuit configuration.  \nRESET \nThe circuitry and serial interface of the AD7792/AD7793 can be reset by writing 32 consecutive 1s to the device. This resets \nthe logic, the digital filter, and the analog modulator while all on-chip registers are reset to their default values. A reset is \nautomatically performed on power-up. When a reset is initiated, \nthe user must allow a period of 500 μs before accessing any of the on-chip registers. A reset is useful if the serial interface \nbecomes asynchronous due to noise on the SCLK line. \nAD7792/AD7793 \n \nRev. B | Page 26 of 32 AV DD MONITOR \nAlong with converting external voltages, the ADC can be used \nto monitor the voltage on the AV DD pin. When Bit CH2 to \nBit CH0 equal 1, the voltage on the AV DD pin is internally \nattenuated by 6, and the resultant voltage is applied to the ∑-Δ modulator using an internal 1.17 V reference for analog-to-\ndigital conversion. This is useful, because variations in the \npower supply voltage can be monitored.  \nCALIBRATION \nThe AD7792/AD7793 provide four calibration modes that can \nbe programmed via the mode bits in the mode register. These \nare internal zero-scale calibration, internal full-scale calibration, system zero-scale calibration, and system full-scale calibration, which effectively reduces the offset error and full-scale error to \nthe order of the noise. After each conversion, the ADC con-\nversion result is scaled using the ADC calibration registers before being written to the data register. The offset calibration coefficient is subtracted from the result prior to multiplication \nby the full-scale coefficient. \nTo start a calibration, write the relevant value to the MD2 to \nMD0 bits in the mode register. After the calibration is complete, \nthe contents of the corresponding calibration registers are \nupdated, the RDY  bit in the status register is set, the DOUT/ \nRDY  pin goes low (if CS is low), and the AD7792/AD7793 \nrevert to idle mode. \nDuring an internal zero-scale or full-scale calibration, the \nrespective zero input and full-scale input are automatically \nconnected internally to the ADC input pins. A system calibration, however, expects the system zero-scale and system full-scale voltages to be applied to the ADC pins before the calibration mode is initiated. In this way, external ADC errors are removed. \nFrom an operational point of view, a calibration should be \ntreated like another ADC conversion. A zero-scale calibration \n(if required) should always be performed before a full-scale \ncalibration. System software should monitor the RDY  bit in  \nthe status register or the DOUT/ RDY  pin to determine the  \nend of calibration via a polling sequence or an interrupt-driven \nroutine. \nBoth an internal offset calibration and a system offset \ncalibration take two conversion cycles. An internal offset calibration is not needed, as the ADC itself removes the offset \ncontinuously. \nTo perform an internal full-scale calibration, a full-scale input \nvoltage is automatically connected to the selected analog input for this calibration. When the gain equals 1, a calibration takes \n2 conversion cycles to complete. For higher gains, 4 conversion \ncycles are required to perform the full-scale calibration. \nDOUT/\nRDY  goes high when the calibration is initiated and \nreturns low when the calibration is complete.  The ADC is placed in idle mode following a calibration. The \nmeasured full-scale coefficient is placed in the full-scale register of the selected channel. Internal full-scale calibrations cannot be performed when the gain equals 128. With this gain setting, a \nsystem full-scale calibration can be performed. A full-scale calibration is required each time the gain of a channel is \nchanged to minimize the full-scale error. \nAn internal full-scale calibration can be performed at specified \nupdate rates only. For gains of 1, 2, and 4, an internal full-scale calibration can be performed at any update rate. However, for higher gains, internal full-scale calibrations can be performed \nwhen the update rate is less than or equal to 16.7 Hz, 33.2 Hz, \nand 50 Hz only. However, the full-scale error does not vary with update rate, so a calibration at one update rate is valid for all update rates (assuming the gain or reference source is not \nchanged). \nA system full-scale calibration takes 2 conversion cycles to \ncomplete, irrespective of the gain setting. A system full-scale \ncalibration can be performed at all gains and all update rates. If \nsystem offset calibrations are being performed along with system full-scale calibrations, the offset calibration should be \nperformed before the system full-scale calibration is initiated.  \nGROUNDING AND LAYOUT \nBecause the analog inputs and reference inputs of the ADC are \ndifferential, most of the voltages in the analog modulator are \ncommon-mode voltages. The excellent common-mode reject-ion of the part removes common-mode noise on these inputs. \nThe digital filter provides rejection of broadband noise on the \npower supply, except at integer multiples of the modulator sampling frequency. The digital filter also removes noise from the analog and reference inputs, provided that these noise sources do not saturate the analog modulator. As a result, the \nAD7792/AD7793 are more immune to noise interference than a \nconventional high resolution converter. However, because the \nresolution of the AD7792/AD7793 is so high, and the noise levels from the AD7792/AD7793 are so low, care must be taken \nwith regard to grounding and layout. \nThe printed circuit board that houses the AD7792/AD7793 \nshould be designed such that the analog and digital sections are \nseparated and confined to certain areas of the board. A mini-\nmum etch technique is generally best for ground planes because \nit provides the best shielding. \nIt is recommended that the GND pins of the AD7792/AD7793 \nbe tied to the AGND plane of the system. In any layout, it is important to keep in mind the flow of currents in the system, ensuring that the return paths for all currents are as close as \npossible to the paths the currents took to reach their destinations. \nAvoid forcing digital currents to flow through the AGND \nsections of the layout. \n AD7792/AD7793\n \nRev. B | Page 27 of 32 The ground planes of the AD7792/AD7793 should be allowed \nto run under the AD7792/AD7793 to prevent noise coupling. The power supply lines to the AD7792/AD7793 should use as wide a trace as possible to provide low impedance paths and \nreduce the effects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast \nswitching signals such as clocks should be shielded with digital ground to avoid radiating noise to other sections of the board, \nand clock signals should never be run near the analog inputs.  \nAvoid crossover of digital and analog signals. Traces on \nopposite sides of the board should run at right angles to each other. This reduces the effects of feedthrough through the \nboard. A microstrip technique is by far the best, but it is not \nalways possible with a double-sided board. In this technique, the component side of the board is dedicated to ground planes, \nand signals are placed on the solder side.  Good decoupling is important when using high resolution \nADCs. AV DD should be decoupled with 10 μF tantalum in \nparallel with 0.1 μF capacitors to GND. DV DD should be \ndecoupled with 10 μF tantalum in parallel with 0.1 μF \ncapacitors to the system’s DGND plane, with the system’s \nAGND to DGND connection being close to the \nAD7792/AD7793.  \nTo achieve the best from these decoupling components, they \nshould be placed as close as possible to the device, ideally right up against the device. All logic chips should be decoupled with \n0.1 μF ceramic capacitors to DGND.  \n \nAD7792/AD7793 \n \nRev. B | Page 28 of 32 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe AD7792/AD7793 provide a low cost, high resolution \nanalog-to-digital function. Be cause the analog-to-digital \nfunction is provided by a ∑-Δ architecture, the parts are more immune to noisy environments, making them ideal for use in \nsensor measurement and industrial and process control \napplications. \nTEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT USING A \nTHERMOCOUPLE  \nFigure 20  outlines a connection from a thermocouple to the \nAD7792/AD7793. In a thermocouple application, the voltage \ngenerated by the thermocouple is measured with respect to an absolute reference, so the internal reference is used for this \nconversion. The cold junction measurement uses a ratiometric \nconfiguration, so the reference is provided externally. \nBecause the signal from the thermocouple is small, the AD7792/AD7793 are operated with the in-amp enabled to  amplify the signal from the thermocouple. As the input channel \nis buffered, large decoupling capacitors can be placed on the front end to eliminate any noise pickup that may be present in the thermocouple leads. The AD7792/AD7793 have a reduced \ncommon-mode range with the in-amp enabled, so the bias \nvoltage generator provides a common-mode voltage so that the \nvoltage generated by the thermocouple is biased up to AV\nDD/2. \nThe cold junction compensation is performed using a thermis-\ntor in the diagram. The on-chip excitation current supplies the \nthermistor. In addition, the reference voltage for the cold junction measurement is derived from a precision resistor in \nseries with the thermistor. This allows a ratiometric measure-\nment so that variation of the excitation current has no effect on the measurement (it is the ratio of the precision reference \nresistance to the thermistor resistance that is measured). \n \n \n04855-012DOUT/RD Y\nDIN\nSCLK\nCS\nDVDDSERIAL\nINTERFACE\nAND\nCONTROL\nLOGICΣ-Δ\nADC\nAD7792/AD7793AIN2(+)\nREFIN(+)\nREFIN(–)AIN2(–)AVDD\nGNDMUXBAND GAP\nREFERENCE\nINTERNAL\nCLOCK\nCLKGNDGND AVDD\nAVDDIN-AMP BUFREFIN(+) REFIN(–)VBIAS\nAIN1(+)\nAIN1(–)\nRRTHERMOCOUPLE\nJUNCTION\nC\nRREF\nIOUT2\n \nFigure 20.

B | Page 29 of 32 TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT USING AN RTD \nTo optimize a 3-wire RTD configuration, two identically \nmatched current sources are required. The AD7792/AD7793, \nwhich contain two well-matched current sources, are ideally suited to these applications. One possible 3-wire configuration \nis shown in \nFigure 21 . In this 3-wire configuration, the lead \nresistances result in errors if only one current is used, as the \nexcitation current flows through RL1, developing a voltage error between AIN1(+) and AIN1(–). In the scheme outlined, the second RTD current source is used to compensate for the error introduced by the excitation current flowing through RL1. The \nsecond RTD current flows through RL2. Assuming RL1 and \nRL2 are equal (the leads would normally be of the same material and of equal length), and IOUT1 and IOUT2 match, the error voltage across RL2 equals the error voltage across RL1, and no error voltage is developed between AIN1(+) and  AIN1(–). Twice the voltage is developed across RL3 but, \nbecause this is a common-mode voltage, it does not introduce \nerrors. The reference voltage for the AD7792/AD7793 is also generated using one of these matched current sources. It is developed using a precision resistor and applied to the differential reference pins of the ADC. This scheme ensures that \nthe analog input voltage span remains ratiometric to the \nreference voltage. Any errors in the analog input voltage due to the temperature drift of the excitation current are compensated \nby the variation of the reference voltage. \n \n04855-013DOUT/RDY\nDIN\nSCLK\nCS\nDVDDSERIAL\nINTERFACE\nAND\nCONTROL\nLOGIC\nAD7792/AD7793IOUT1\nREFIN(+)\nREFIN(–)AVDD\nGNDBAND GAP\nREFERENCE\nINTERNAL\nCLOCK\nCLKGNDGND AVDD\nIN-AMP BUFREFIN(+) REFIN(–)\nAIN1(+)\nAIN1(–)\nRREFIOUT2RL2RL1\nRTD\nRL3Σ-Δ\nADC\n \nFigure 21.
