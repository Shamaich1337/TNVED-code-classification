The saturation current, ISAT, is the current at which the component inductance drops \nby 30% (typical) at an ambient temperature of 25°C. This current is determined by \nplacing the component in the specified ambient environment and applying a short \nduration pulse current (to eliminate self-heating effects) to the component.\n3.
