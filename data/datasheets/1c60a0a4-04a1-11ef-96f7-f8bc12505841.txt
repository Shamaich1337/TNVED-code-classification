The DS18S20 communicates over a 1-Wire \nbus that by definition requires only one data line (and \nground) for communication with a central microprocessor. \nIn addition, the DS18S20 can derive power directly from \nthe data line (“parasite power”), eliminating the need for \nan external power supply.\nEach DS18S20 has a unique 64-bit serial code, which \nallows multiple DS18S20s to function on the same 1-Wire \nbus. Thus, it is simple to use one microprocessor to \ncontrol many DS18S20s distributed over a large area. \nApplications that can benefit from this feature include \nHVAC environmental controls, temperature monitoring \nsystems inside buildings, equipment, or machinery, and \nprocess monitoring and control systems.\nApplications\n ●Thermostatic Controls\n ●Industrial Systems\n ●Consumer Products\n ●Thermometers\n ●Thermally Sensitive SystemsBenefits and Features\n ●Unique 1-Wire ® Interface Requires Only One Port \nPin for Communication\n ●Maximize System Accuracy in Broad Range of \nThermal Management Applications\n• Measures Temperatures from -55°C to +125°C \n(-67°F to +257°F)\n• ±0.5°C Accuracy from -10°C to +85°C\n• 9-Bit Resolution\n• No External Components Required\n ●Parasite Power Mode Requires Only 2 Pins for \nOperation (DQ and GND)\n ●Simplifies Distributed Temperature-Sensing \nApplications with Multidrop Capability\n• Each Device Has a Unique 64-Bit Serial Code \nStored in On-Board ROM\n ●Flexible User-Definable Nonvolatile (NV) Alarm Settings \nwith Alarm Search Command Identifies Devices with \nTemperatures Outside Programmed Limits\n ●Available in 8-Pin SO (150 mils) and 3-Pin TO-92 \nPackages\nOrdering Information  appears at end of data sheet.\n1-Wire is a registered trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.\n19-5474; Rev 3; 4/15BOTTOM VIEW2N.C.\nN.C.\nVDD\nDQN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.\nGNDDS18S20\nSO (150 mils)\n(DS18S20Z) +1\n4378\n56DS18S20\n1 2 3\nGND DQ VDD\n1    1 2 3TOP VIEW\nTO-92 \n(DS18S20)\nDS18S20 High-Precision 1-Wire Digital Thermometer \nVoltage Range on Any Pin Relative to Ground  ....-0.5V to +6.0V\nContinuous Power Dissipation (T A = +70°C)  \n8-Pin SO (derate 5.9mW/°C above +70°C)  .............. 470.6mW  \n3-Pin TO-92 (derate 6.3mW/°C above +70°C)  ............ 500mW\nOperating Temperature Range  ......................... -55°C to +125°CStorage Temperature Range  ............................ -55°C to +125°C\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s)  ................................. +260°C\nSoldering Temperature (reflow)  \nLead(Pb)-free .............................................................. .+260°C  \nContaining lead(Pb)  ..................................................... +240°C\nNote 1:  All voltages are referenced to ground. \nNote 2:  The Pullup Supply Voltage specification assumes that the pullup device is ideal, and therefore the high level of the pul -\nlup is equal to V PU.

In addition, the scratchpad provides access to the \n1-byte upper and lower alarm trigger registers (T H and \nTL). The T H and T L registers are nonvolatile (EEPROM), \nso they will retain data when the device is powered down.\nThe DS18S20 uses Maxim’s exclusive 1-Wire bus proto -\ncol that implements bus communication using one control \nsignal. The control line requires a weak pullup resistor \nsince all devices are linked to the bus via a 3-state or \nopen-drain port (the DQ pin in the case of the DS18S20). \nIn this bus system, the microprocessor (the master \ndevice) identifies and addresses devices on the bus \nusing each device’s unique 64-bit code. Because each \ndevice has a unique code, the number of devices that \ncan be addressed on one bus is virtually unlimited.  The \n1-Wire bus protocol, including detailed explanations of the \ncommands and “time slots,” is covered in the 1-Wire Bus \nSystem  section.\nAnother feature of the DS18S20 is the ability to operate \nwithout an external power supply. Power is instead sup -\nplied through the 1-Wire pullup resistor via the DQ pin \nwhen the bus is high. The high bus signal also charges an internal capacitor (C PP), which then supplies power to the \ndevice when the bus is low. This method of deriving power \nfrom the 1-Wire bus is referred to as “parasite power.” As \nan alternative, the DS18S20 may also be powered by an \nexternal supply on V DD.\nOperation—Measuring Temperature\nThe core functionality of the DS18S20 is its direct-to-dig -\nital temperature sensor. The temperature sensor output \nhas 9-bit resolution, which corresponds to 0.5°C steps. \nThe DS18S20 powers-up in a low-power idle state; to \ninitiate a temperature measurement and A-to-D conver -\nsion, the master must issue a Convert T [44h] command. \nFollowing the conversion, the resulting thermal data is \nstored in the 2-byte temperature register in the scratch -\npad memory and the DS18S20 returns to its idle state. \nIf the DS18S20 is powered by an external supply, the \nmaster can issue “read-time slots” (see the 1-Wire Bus \nSystem  section) after the Convert T command and the \nDS18S20 will respond by transmitting 0 while the tem -\nperature conversion is in progress and 1 when the con -\nversion is done. If the DS18S20 is powered with parasite \npower, this notification technique cannot be used since \nthe bus must be pulled high by a strong pullup during the \nentire temperature conversion. The bus requirements for \nparasite power are explained in detail in the Powering The \nDS18S20  section.\nFigure 3.

The temperature data is \nstored as a 16-bit sign-extended two’s complement num -\nber in the temperature register (see Figure 4 ). The sign \nbits (S) indicate if the temperature is positive or negative: \nfor positive numbers S = 0 and for negative numbers S = \n1. Table 1  gives examples of digital output data and the \ncorresponding temperature reading.\nResolutions greater than 9 bits can be calculated using the \ndata from the temperature, COUNT REMAIN and COUNT \nPER °C registers in the scratchpad. Note that the COUNT \nPER °C register is hard-wired to 16 (10h). After reading \nthe scratchpad, the TEMP_READ value is obtained by \ntruncating the 0.5°C bit (bit 0) from the temperature data \n(see Figure 4 ). The extended resolution temperature can \nthen be calculated using the following equation:\nTEMPERATURE TEMP_READ 0.25\nCOUNT_PER_C COUNT_REMAIN\nCOUNT_PER_C= −\n−+Operation—Alarm Signaling\nAfter the DS18S20 performs a temperature conversion, \nthe temperature value is compared to the user-defined \ntwo’s complement alarm trigger values stored in the \n1-byte T H and T L registers (see Figure 5 ). The sign bit (S) \nindicates if the value is positive or negative: for positive \nnumbers S = 0 and for negative numbers S = 1. The T H \nand T L registers are nonvolatile (EEPROM) so they will \nretain data when the device is powered down. T H and T L \ncan be accessed through bytes 2 and 3 of the scratchpad \nas explained in the Memory  section.\nOnly bits 8 through 1 of the temperature register are used \nin the T H and T L comparison since T H and T L are 8-bit \nregisters. If the measured temperature is lower than or \nequal to T L or higher than T H, an alarm condition exists \nand an alarm flag is set inside the DS18S20. This flag is \nupdated after every temperature measurement; therefore, \nif the alarm condition goes away, the flag will be turned off \nafter the next temperature conversion.\nTable 1.

Any DS18S20s with a set alarm flag will \nrespond to the command, so the master can determine \nexactly which DS18S20s have experienced an alarm \ncondition. If an alarm condition exists and the T H or T L \nsettings have changed, another temperature conversion \nshould be done to validate the alarm condition.\nPowering The DS18S20\nThe DS18S20 can be powered by an external supply on \nthe V DD pin, or it can operate in “parasite power” mode, \nwhich allows the DS18S20 to function without a local \nexternal supply. Parasite power is very useful for applica -\ntions that require remote temperature sensing or those \nwith space constraints. Figure 3  shows the DS18S20’s \nparasite-power control circuitry, which “steals” power from \nthe 1-Wire bus via the DQ pin when the bus is high. The \nstolen charge powers the DS18S20 while the bus is high, \nand some of the charge is stored on the parasite power \ncapacitor (C PP) to provide power when the bus is low.  \nWhen the DS18S20 is used in parasite power mode, the \nVDD pin must be connected to ground.\nIn parasite power mode, the 1-Wire bus and C PP can \nprovide sufficient current to the DS18S20 for most opera -\ntions as long as the specified timing and voltage require -\nments are met (see the DC Electrical Characteristics  \nand the AC Electrical Characteristics ). However, when \nthe DS18S20 is performing temperature conversions or \ncopying data from the scratchpad memory to EEPROM, \nthe operating current can be as high as 1.5mA. This \ncurrent can cause an unacceptable voltage drop across \nthe weak 1-Wire pullup resistor and is more current than \ncan be supplied by C PP. To assure that the DS18S20 \nhas sufficient supply current, it is necessary to provide a \nstrong pullup on the 1-Wire bus whenever temperature conversions are taking place or data is being copied from \nthe scratchpad to EEPROM. This can be accomplished \nby using a MOSFET to pull the bus directly to the rail \nas shown in Figure 6 . The 1-Wire bus must be switched \nto the strong pullup within 10µs (max) after a Convert T \n[44h] or Copy Scratchpad [48h] command is issued, and \nthe bus must be held high by the pullup for the duration \nof the conversion (t CONV ) or data transfer (t WR = 10ms). \nNo other activity can take place on the 1-Wire bus while \nthe pullup is enabled.\nThe DS18S20 can also be powered by the conventional \nmethod of connecting an external power supply to the \nVDD pin, as shown in Figure 7 . The advantage of this \nmethod is that the MOSFET pullup is not required, and \nthe 1-Wire bus is free to carry other traffic during the tem -\nperature conversion time.\nThe use of parasite power is not recommended for tem -\nperatures above 100°C since the DS18S20 may not be \nable to sustain communications due to the higher leak -\nage currents that can exist at these temperatures. For \napplications in which such temperatures are likely, it is \nstrongly recommended that the DS18S20 be powered by \nan external power supply.\nIn some situations the bus master may not know whether \nthe DS18S20s on the bus are parasite powered or pow -\nered by external supplies. The master needs this informa -\ntion to determine if the strong bus pullup should be used \nduring temperature conversions. To get this information, \nthe master can issue a Skip ROM [CCh] command fol -\nlowed by a Read Power Supply [B4h] command followed \nby a “read-time slot”. During the read-time slot, parasite \npowered DS18S20s will pull the bus low, and externally \npowered DS18S20s will let the bus remain high. If the \nbus is pulled low, the master knows that it must supply \nthe strong pullup on the 1-Wire bus during temperature \nconversions.\nFigure 6.

The least significant 8 bits of the \nROM code contain the DS18S20’s 1-Wire family code: \n10h. The next 48 bits contain a unique serial number. \nThe most significant 8 bits contain a cyclic redundancy \ncheck (CRC) byte that is calculated from the first 56 bits \nof the ROM code. A detailed explanation of the CRC bits \nis provided in the CRC Generation  section. The 64-bit \nROM code and associated ROM function control logic \nallow the DS18S20 to operate as a 1-Wire device using \nthe protocol detailed in the 1-Wire Bus System  section.\nMemory\nThe DS18S20’s memory is organized as shown in  \nFigure 9 . The memory consists of an SRAM scratch -\npad with nonvolatile EEPROM storage for the high and \nlow alarm trigger registers (T H and T L). Note that if the \nDS18S20 alarm function is not used, the T H and T L reg-\nisters can serve as general-purpose memory. All mem -\nory commands are described in detail in the DS18S20 \nFunction Commands  section.Byte 0 and byte 1 of the scratchpad contain the LSB and \nthe MSB of the temperature register, respectively. These \nbytes are read-only. Bytes 2 and 3 provide access to T H \nand T L registers. Bytes 4 and 5 are reserved for internal \nuse by the device and cannot be overwritten; these bytes \nwill return all 1s when read. Bytes 6 and 7 contain the \nCOUNT REMAIN and COUNT PER ºC registers, which \ncan be used to calculate extended resolution results as \nexplained in the Operation—Measuring Temperature  \nsection.\nByte 8 of the scratchpad is read-only and contains the \nCRC code for bytes 0 through 7 of the scratchpad. \nThe DS18S20 generates this CRC using the method \ndescribed in the CRC Generation  section. \nData is written to bytes 2 and 3 of the scratchpad using \nthe Write Scratchpad [4Eh] command; the data must be \ntransmitted to the DS18S20 starting with the least signifi -\ncant bit of byte 2. To verify data integrity, the scratchpad \ncan be read (using the Read Scratchpad [BEh] command) \nafter the data is written. When reading the scratchpad, \ndata is transferred over the 1-Wire bus starting with the \nleast significant bit of byte 0. To transfer the T H and T L \ndata from the scratchpad to EEPROM, the master must \nissue the Copy Scratchpad [48h] command. \nFigure 8. 64-Bit Lasered ROM Code\nFigure 9.

The scratchpad CRC is calculated from \nthe data stored in the scratchpad, and therefore it chang -\nes when the data in the scratchpad changes. The CRCs \nprovide the bus master with a method of data validation \nwhen data is read from the DS18S20. To verify that data \nhas been read correctly, the bus master must re-calculate \nthe CRC from the received data and then compare this \nvalue to either the ROM code CRC (for ROM reads) or \nto the scratchpad CRC (for scratchpad reads). If the cal -\nculated CRC matches the read CRC, the data has been \nreceived error free. The comparison of CRC values and \nthe decision to continue with an operation are determined \nentirely by the bus master. There is no circuitry inside the \nDS18S20 that prevents a command sequence from pro -\nceeding if the DS18S20 CRC (ROM or scratchpad) does \nnot match the value generated by the bus master.The equivalent polynomial function of the CRC (ROM or \nscratchpad) is:\nCRC = X 8 + X5 + X4 + 1\nThe bus master can re-calculate the CRC and compare it \nto the CRC values from the DS18S20 using the polyno -\nmial generator shown in Figure 10 . This circuit consists \nof a shift register and XOR gates, and the shift register \nbits are initialized to 0. Starting with the least significant \nbit of the ROM code or the least significant bit of byte 0 \nin the scratchpad, one bit at a time should shifted into the \nshift register. After shifting in the 56th bit from the ROM or \nthe most significant bit of byte 7 from the scratchpad, the \npolynomial generator will contain the re-calculated CRC. \nNext, the 8-bit ROM code or scratchpad CRC from the \nDS18S20 must be shifted into the circuit. At this point, if \nthe re-calculated CRC was correct, the shift register will \ncontain all 0s. Additional information about the Maxim \n1-Wire cyclic redundancy check is available in Application \nNote 27: Understanding and Using Cyclic Redundancy \nChecks with Maxim ịButton Products .\n1-Wire Bus System\nThe 1-Wire bus system uses a single bus master to con -\ntrol one or more slave devices. The DS18S20 is always a \nslave. When there is only one slave on the bus, the sys -\ntem is referred to as a “single-drop” system; the system is \n“multidrop” if there are multiple slaves on the bus.\nAll data and commands are transmitted least significant \nbit first over the 1-Wire bus.\nThe following discussion of the 1-Wire bus system is \nbroken down into three topics: hardware configuration, \ntransaction sequence, and 1-Wire signaling (signal types \nand timing).\nFigure 10. CRC Generator(MSB ) (LSB) XOR  XOR  XOR  INPUT  \nDS18S20 High-Precision 1-Wire Digital Thermometer \nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 9\nHardware Configuration\nThe 1-Wire bus has by definition only a single data line. \nEach device (master or slave) interfaces to the data line via \nan open drain or 3-state port. This allows each device to \n“release” the data line when the device is not transmitting \ndata so the bus is available for use by another device. The \n1-Wire port of the DS18S20 (the DQ pin) is open drain with \nan internal circuit equivalent to that shown in Figure 11 .\nThe 1-Wire bus requires an external pullup resistor of \napproximately 5kΩ; thus, the idle state for the 1-Wire \nbus is high. If for any reason a transaction needs to be \nsuspended, the bus MUST be left in the idle state if the \ntransaction is to resume. Infinite recovery time can occur \nbetween bits so long as the 1-Wire bus is in the inactive \n(high) state during the recovery period. If the bus is held \nlow for more than 480µs, all components on the bus will \nbe reset.\nTransaction Sequence\nThe transaction sequence for accessing the DS18S20 is \nas follows:\nStep 1. Initialization\nStep 2. ROM Command (followed by any required data \nexchange)\nStep 3. DS18S20 Function Command (followed by any \nrequired data exchange)\nIt is very important to follow this sequence every time the \nDS18S20 is accessed, as the DS18S20 will not respond \nif any steps in the sequence are missing or out of order. \nExceptions to this rule are the Search ROM [F0h] and \nAlarm Search [ECh] commands. After issuing either of \nthese ROM commands, the master must return to Step 1 \nin the sequence.Initialization\nAll transactions on the 1-Wire bus begin with an initializa -\ntion sequence. The initialization sequence consists of a \nreset pulse transmitted by the bus master followed by \npresence pulse(s) transmitted by the slave(s). The pres -\nence pulse lets the bus master know that slave devices \n(such as the DS18S20) are on the bus and are ready \nto operate. Timing for the reset and presence pulses is \ndetailed in the 1-Wire Signaling  section.\nROM Commands\nAfter the bus master has detected a presence pulse, it \ncan issue a ROM command. These commands operate \non the unique 64-bit ROM codes of each slave device and \nallow the master to single out a specific device if many \nare present on the 1-Wire bus. These commands also \nallow the master to determine how many and what types \nof devices are present on the bus or if any device has \nexperienced an alarm condition. There are five ROM com -\nmands, and each command is 8 bits long.  The master \ndevice must issue an appropriate ROM command before \nissuing a DS18S20 function command. A flowchart for \noperation of the ROM commands is shown in Figure 16 .\nSearch Rom [F0h]\nWhen a system is initially powered up, the master must \nidentify the ROM codes of all slave devices on the bus, \nwhich allows the master to determine the number of \nslaves and their device types. The master learns the ROM \ncodes through a process of elimination that requires the \nmaster to perform a Search ROM cycle (i.e., Search ROM \ncommand followed by data exchange) as many times as \nnecessary to identify all of the slave devices. If there is \nonly one slave on the bus, the simpler Read ROM com -\nmand (see below) can be used in place of the Search \nROM process. For a detailed explanation of the Search \nROM procedure, refer to the ịButton ® Book of Standards  \nat www. maximintegrated .com/ibuttonbook . After every \nSearch ROM cycle, the bus master must return to Step 1 \n(Initialization) in the transaction sequence.\nRead ROM [33h]\nThis command can only be used when there is one slave \non the bus. It allows the bus master to read the slave’s \n64-bit ROM code without using the Search ROM proce -\ndure.  If this command is used when there is more than \none slave present on the bus, a data collision will occur \nwhen all the slaves attempt to respond at the same time. \nịButton is a registered trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.Figure 11.

No other bus activity may take place during this time.\nNote 2:  The master can interrupt the transmission of data at any time by issuing a reset.\nNote 3:  Both bytes must be written before a reset is issued.Match ROM [55h]\nThe match ROM command followed by a 64-bit ROM \ncode sequence allows the bus master to address a \nspecific slave device on a multidrop or single-drop bus. \nOnly the slave that exactly matches the 64-bit ROM code \nsequence will respond to the function command issued \nby the master; all other slaves on the bus will wait for a \nreset pulse. \nSkip ROM [CCh]\nThe master can use this command to address all devices \non the bus simultaneously without sending out any ROM \ncode information. For example, the master can make all \nDS18S20s on the bus perform simultaneous temperature \nconversions by issuing a Skip ROM command followed by \na Convert T [44h] command. \nNote that the Read Scratchpad [BEh] command can fol -\nlow the Skip ROM command only if there is a single slave \ndevice on the bus. In this case, time is saved by allowing \nthe master to read from the slave without sending the \ndevice’s 64-bit ROM code. A Skip ROM command followed \nby a Read Scratchpad command will cause a data collision \non the bus if there is more than one slave since multiple \ndevices will attempt to transmit data simultaneously. Alarm Search [ECh]\nThe operation of this command is identical to the operation \nof the Search ROM command except that only slaves with \na set alarm flag will respond. This command allows the \nmaster device to determine if any DS18S20s experienced \nan alarm condition during the most recent temperature \nconversion. After every Alarm Search cycle (i.e., Alarm \nSearch command followed by data exchange), the bus \nmaster must return to Step 1 (Initialization) in the transac -\ntion sequence. See the Operation—Alarm Signaling  sec-\ntion for an explanation of alarm flag operation.\nDS18S20 Function Commands\nAfter the bus master has used a ROM command to \naddress the DS18S20 with which it wishes to communi -\ncate, the master can issue one of the DS18S20 function \ncommands. These commands allow the master to write \nto and read from the DS18S20’s scratchpad memory, \ninitiate temperature conversions and determine the power \nsupply mode. The DS18S20 function commands, which \nare described below, are summarized in Table 2  and illus -\ntrated by the flowchart in Figure 17 .\nTable 2.

If the device is being used in parasite power \nmode, within 10µs (max) after this command is issued the \nmaster must enable a strong pullup on the 1-Wire bus for \nthe duration of the conversion (t CONV ) as described in the \nPowering The DS18S20  section. If the DS18S20 is pow -\nered by an external supply, the master can issue read-\ntime slots after the Convert T command and the DS18S20 \nwill respond by transmitting 0 while the temperature con -\nversion is in progress and 1 when the conversion is done. \nIn parasite power mode this notification technique cannot \nbe used since the bus is pulled high by the strong pullup \nduring the conversion.\nWrite Scratchpad [4Eh]\nThis command allows the master to write 2 bytes of data \nto the DS18S20’s scratchpad. The first byte is written into \nthe T H register (byte 2 of the scratchpad), and the second \nbyte is written into the T L register (byte 3 of the scratch -\npad). Data must be transmitted least significant bit first. \nBoth bytes MUST be written before the master issues a \nreset, or the data may be corrupted.\nRead Scratchpad [BEh]\nThis command allows the master to read the contents of \nthe scratchpad.  The data transfer starts with the least sig -\nnificant bit of byte 0 and continues through the scratchpad \nuntil the 9th byte (byte 8 – CRC) is read. The master may \nissue a reset to terminate reading at any time if only part \nof the scratchpad data is needed.Copy Scratchpad [48h]\nThis command copies the contents of the scratchpad T H \nand T L registers (bytes 2 and 3) to EEPROM. If the device \nis being used in parasite power mode, within 10µs (max) \nafter this command is issued the master must enable \na strong pullup on the 1-Wire bus for at least 10ms as \ndescribed in the Powering The DS18S20  section.\nRecall E2 [B8h]\nThis command recalls the alarm trigger values (T H and \nTL) from EEPROM and places the data in bytes 2 and \n3, respectively, in the scratchpad memory. The master \ndevice can issue read-time slots following the Recall E 2 \ncommand and the DS18S20 will indicate the status of the \nrecall by transmitting 0 while the recall is in progress and \n1 when the recall is done. The recall operation happens \nautomatically at power-up, so valid data is available in \nthe scratchpad as soon as power is applied to the device.\nRead Power Supply [B4h]\nThe master device issues this command followed by a \nread-time slot to determine if any DS18S20s on the bus \nare using parasite power. During the read-time slot, para -\nsite powered DS18S20s will pull the bus low, and exter -\nnally powered DS18S20s will let the bus remain high. See \nthe Powering The DS18S20  section for usage information \nfor this command.\n1-Wire Signaling\nThe DS18S20 uses a strict 1-Wire communication pro -\ntocol to ensure data integrity. Several signal types are \ndefined by this protocol: reset pulse, presence pulse, \nwrite 0, write 1, read 0, and read 1. All these signals, with \nthe exception of the presence pulse, are initiated by the \nbus master.\nDS18S20 High-Precision 1-Wire Digital Thermometer \nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 12\nInitialization Procedure—Reset And  \nPresence Pulses\nAll communication with the DS18S20 begins with an ini -\ntialization sequence that consists of a reset pulse from the \nmaster followed by a presence pulse from the DS18S20. \nThis is illustrated in Figure 12 . When the DS18S20 sends \nthe presence pulse in response to the reset, it is indicating \nto the master that it is on the bus and ready to operate.\nDuring the initialization sequence the bus master trans -\nmits (Tx) the reset pulse by pulling the 1-Wire bus low \nfor a minimum of 480µs. The bus master then releases \nthe bus and goes into receive mode (Rx). When the bus \nis released, the 5kΩ pullup resistor pulls the 1-Wire bus \nhigh. When the DS18S20 detects this rising edge, it waits \n15µs to 60µs and then transmits a presence pulse by pull -\ning the 1-Wire bus low for 60µs to 240µs.\nRead/Write Time Slots\nThe bus master writes data to the DS18S20 during write \ntime slots and reads data from the DS18S20 during read-\ntime slots. One bit of data is transmitted over the 1-Wire \nbus per time slot.Write Time Slots\nThere are two types of write time slots: “Write 1” time slots \nand “Write 0” time slots. The bus master uses a Write 1 \ntime slot to write a logic 1 to the DS18S20 and a Write \n0 time slot to write a logic 0 to the DS18S20. All write \ntime slots must be a minimum of 60µs in duration with a \nminimum of a 1µs recovery time between individual write \nslots. Both types of write time slots are initiated by the \nmaster pulling the 1-Wire bus low (see Figure 13 ).\nTo generate a Write 1 time slot, after pulling the 1-Wire \nbus low, the bus master must release the 1-Wire bus \nwithin 15µs. When the bus is released, the 5kΩ pullup \nresistor will pull the bus high. To generate a Write 0 time \nslot, after pulling the 1-Wire bus low, the bus master must \ncontinue to hold the bus low for the duration of the time \nslot (at least 60µs). The DS18S20 samples the 1-Wire \nbus during a window that lasts from 15µs to 60µs after the \nmaster initiates the write time slot. If the bus is high during \nthe sampling window, a 1 is written to the DS18S20. If the \nline is low, a 0 is written to the DS18S20.\nFigure 12.

Therefore, the master \nmust generate read-time slots immediately after issuing \na Read Scratchpad [BEh] or Read Power Supply [B4h] \ncommand, so that the DS18S20 can provide the request -\ned data. In addition, the master can generate read-time \nslots after issuing Convert T [44h] or Recall E 2 [B8h] com -\nmands to find out the status of the operation as explained \nin the DS18S20 Function Commands  section.\nAll read-time slots must be a minimum of 60µs in duration \nwith a minimum of a 1µs recovery time between slots. A \nread-time slot is initiated by the master device pulling the \n1-Wire bus low for a minimum of 1µs and then releasing \nthe bus (see Figure 13 ). After the master initiates the read-time slot, the DS18S20 will begin transmitting a 1 \nor 0 on bus. The DS18S20 transmits a 1 by leaving the \nbus high and transmits a 0 by pulling the bus low. When \ntransmitting a 0, the DS18S20 will release the bus by the \nend of the time slot, and the bus will be pulled back to \nits high idle state by the pullup resister. Output data from \nthe DS18S20 is valid for 15µs after the falling edge that \ninitiated the read-time slot. Therefore, the master must \nrelease the bus and then sample the bus state within \n15µs from the start of the slot.\nFigure 14  illustrates that the sum of T INIT, TRC, and \nTSAMPLE  must be less than 15µs for a read-time slot. \nFigure 15  shows that system timing margin is maximized \nby keeping T INIT and T RC as short as possible and by \nlocating the master sample time during read-time slots \ntowards the end of the 15µs period.\nFigure 14.
