These DACs utilize data readback, \nallowing the user to read the contents of the DAC register via \nthe DB pins. On power -up, the internal register and latches are \nfilled with 0s and the DAC outputs are at zero scale.  \nAs a result of manufacturing with a CMOS submicron process, \nthey offer excellent 4 -quadrant multiplication characteristics, \nwith large signal multiplying bandwidths of up to 10 MHz.  \nThe applied external reference input voltage (V REF) determines the  \nfull-scale output current. An integrated  feedback resistor (R FB) \nprovides temperature tracking and full -scale voltage output \nwhen combined with an external I -to-V precision amplifier.  \nWhile these devices are upgrades of the AD54 24/AD5433 / \nAD5445 in multiplying bandwidth performance, they have a \nlatched interface and cannot be used in transpare nt mode.  \nThe AD5424 is available in  a small, 20 -lead LFCSP and  a small,  \n16-lead TSSO P, while the AD5433  and AD5445  DACs are available  \nin a small, 20 -lead LFCSP and  a small, 20 -lead TSSOP .  \nThe EVA L -AD5445SDZ  evaluation board is ava ilable for \nevaluating DAC performance.

E | Page 17 of 28 TERMINOLOGY  \nRelative Accuracy  \nRelative accuracy or endpoint nonlinearity is a measure of the \nmaximum deviation from a straight line passing through the endpoints of the DAC transfer function. It is mea sured after \nadjusting zero scale and full scale and is normally expressed in \nLSBs or as a percentage of full -scale reading.  \nDifferential Nonlinearity  \nDifferential nonlinearity is the difference between the measured \nchange and the ideal 1 LSB change between  any two adjacent \ncodes. A specified differential nonlinearity of – 1 LSB maximum \nover the operating temperature range ensures monotonicity.  \nGain Error  \nGain error or full -scale error is a measure of the output error \nbetween an ideal DAC and the actual devi ce output. For these \nDACs, ideal maximum output is V\nREF – 1 LSB. Gain error of the \nDACs is adjustable to 0 with external resistance.  \nOutput Leakage Current  \nOutput leakage current is current that flows in the DAC ladder switches when these are turned off. F or the I\nOUT1 terminal, it \ncan be measured by loading all 0s to the DAC and measuring \nthe I OUT1 current. Minimum current flows in the I OUT2 line \nwhen the DAC is loaded with all 1s. \nOutput Capacitance  \nCapacitance from I OUT1, or I OUT2, to AGND.  \nOutput Current  Settling Time  \nThis is the amount of time it takes for the output to settle to a \nspecified level for a full -scale input change. For these devices, it \nis specified with a 100 Ω resistor to ground.  \nThe settling time specification includes the digital delay from \nthe CS rising edge to the full -scale output change.  \nDigital -to-Analog Glitch I mpulse  \nThe amount of charge injected from the digital inputs to the \nanalog output when the inputs change state. This is normally specified as the area of the glitch in either pA seconds or nV \nseconds, depending upon whether the glitch is measured as a \ncurrent or voltage signal.  Digital Feedthrough  \nWhen the device is not s elected, high frequency logic activity \non the device digital inputs can  be capacitively coupled through \nthe device to show up as noise on the I\nOUT pins and \nsubsequently in the following circuitry. This noise is called \ndigital feedthrough.  \nMultiplying Feedt hrough Error \nThis is the error due to capacitive feedthrough from the DAC \nreference input to the DAC I OUT1 terminal when all 0s are \nloaded to the DAC.  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)  \nThe DAC is driven by an ac reference. The ratio of the rms sum \nof the har monics of the DAC output to the fundamental value is \nthe THD. Usually only the lower order harmonics are included, \nsuch as second to fifth.  \n( )\n12\n52\n42\n32\n2log20VV V V V\nTHD+++\n=  \nDigital Intermodulation Distortion  \nSecond -order intermodulation distortion (IMD) measurement s \nare the relative magnitude of the fa and fb tones generated \ndigitally by the DAC and the second- order products at 2fa − fb \nand 2fb − fa.  \nSpurious -Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)  \nSFDR is the usable dynamic range of a DAC before spurious \nnoise interferes or dist orts the fundamental signal. It is measured  \nby the difference in amplitude between the fundamental and the \nlargest harmonically or nonharmonically related spur from dc to full Nyquist bandwidth (half the DAC sampling rate, or f\nS/2). \nNarrow -band SFDR is a m easure of SFDR over an arbitrary \nwindow size, in this case, 50% of the fundamental. Digital SFDR is a measure of the usable dynamic range of the DAC when the \nsignal is a digitally generated sine wave.  \n \n \nAD5424/AD5433/AD5445  Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 18 of 28 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe AD5424 , AD5433, and AD5445 are 8 -, 10-, and 12 -bit \ncurrent output DACs consi sting of a standard inverting R -2R \nladder configuration. A simplified diagram for the 8 -bit AD5424 is \nshown in Figure 48. The matching feedback resistor R FB has a \nvalue of R. The value of R is typically 10 kΩ  (mini mum 8 kΩ  \nand maximum 12 kΩ). If I OUT1 and I OUT2 are kept at the same \npotential, a constant current flows in each ladder leg, regardless \nof digital input code. Therefore, the input resistance presented \nat V REF is always constant  and nominally of resistance value R. \nThe DAC output (I OUT) is code -dependent, producing various \nresistances and capacitances. External amplifier choice must  \ntake into account the variation in impedance generated by the \nDAC on the amplifiers inverting inpu t node.   \n03160-048VREFR R R\nR2R\nS1 S2 S3 S82R 2R 2R 2R\nDAC DATA LATCHES\nAND DRIVERSRFBA\nIOUT1\nIOUT2\n \nFigure 48. Simplified Ladder  \nAccess is provided to the V REF, R FB, IOUT1, and I OUT2 terminals of \nthe DAC, making the device extremely versatile and allowing it \nto be configured in several different operating modes, for ex ample,  \nto provide a unipolar output, 4 -quadrant multiplication in bipolar  \nmode or in single -supply modes of operation. Note that a matching  \nswitch is used in series with the internal R FB feedback resistor. If \nusers attempt to measure R FB, power must be app lied to V DD to \nachieve continuity.  \nCIRCUIT OPERATION  \nUnipolar Mode  \nUsing a single op amp, these devices can easily be configured to \nprovide 2 -quadrant multiplying operation or a unipolar output \nvoltage swing, as shown in Figure 49. \nWhen an output amplifier is connected in unipolar mode, the \noutput voltage is given by  \nn REF OUTDV V2×−=  \n where D is the fractional representation of the digital word loaded  \nto the DAC and  n is the resolution of the DAC.  \nD = 0 to 255 (8- bit AD5424)  \n= 0 to 1023 (10- bit AD5433)  \n= 0 to 4095 (12- bit AD5445)  \nNote that the output voltage polarity is opposite to the V REF \npolarity for dc reference voltages.  \nThese DACs are designed to operate with either negative or positive \nreference voltages.

Bipolar Operation (4- Quadrant Multiplication)\nBIPOLAR OPERATION  \nIn some applications, it can be necessary to generate full  \n4-quadran t multiplying operation or a bipolar output swing. \nThis can be easily accomplished by using another external \namplifier and some external resistors, as shown in Figure 50. \nIn this circuit, the second amplifier, A2, provides a gain o f 2. \nBiasing the external amplifier with an offset from the reference \nvoltage, results in full 4 -quadrant multiplying operation. The \ntransfer function of this circuit shows that both negative and \npositive output voltages are created as the input data (D) i s \nincremented from code zero (V OUT = –VREF) to midscale  \n(V OUT = 0 V) to full scale (V OUT = +V REF). \n( )REFn\nREF OUT V D V V − ×=−12/  \nwhere D is the fractional representation of the digital word \nloaded to the DAC and n is the resolution of the DAC.  \nD = 0 to 255 (8- bit AD5424)  \n= 0 to 1023 (10- bit AD5433)  \n= 0 to 4095 (12- bit AD5445)  \nWhen V IN is an ac signal, the circuit performs 4 -quadrant \nmultiplication.  \nTable 8 shows the relationship between digital code and the \nexpected  output voltage for bipolar operation ( AD5424,  \n8-bit device).  \nTable 8.

Since every  code \nchange corresponds to a step function, gain peaking c an occur \nif the op amp has limited GBP and there is excessive parasitic capacitance at the inverting node. This parasitic capacitance \nintroduces a pole into the open -loop response, which can cause \nringing or instability in closed -loop applications. \nAn opti onal compensation capacitor, C1, can be added in parallel \nwith R\nFB for stability, as shown in Figure 49 and Figure 50. To o \nsmall a value of C1 can produce ringing at the output, while too \nlarge a value ca n adversely affect the settling time. C1 must  be \nfound empirically, but 1 pF to 2 pF is generally adequate for \ncompensation.  \n \nAD5424/AD5433/AD5445  Data Sheet \n \nRev.

It is important \nto consider the effect of the temperature coefficients of the thin \nfilm resistors of the DAC. Simply placing a resistor in series with  \nthe R FB resistor causes mismatches in the temperature coeffici ents \nand results in larger gain temperature coefficient errors. Instead, \nthe circuit shown in Figure 53 is a recommended method of \nincreasing the gain of the circuit. R1, R2, and R3 must  have \nsimilar temperature coefficients, but they need not match \nthe temperature coefficients of the DAC. This approach is \nrecom mended in circuits where gains greater than 1 are required . \nNote that R FB >> R2||R3 and tak e into consideration  a gain error \npercentage of 100 ×  (R2||R3)/R FB.  \n03160-0548-/10-/12-BIT\nDAC\nGNDVDD RFBVDD\nVOUTVREFVIN\nADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY\nC1 PHASE COMPENSATION (1pF TO 2pF) MAY BE\nREQUIRED IF A1 IS A HIGH SPEED  AMPLIFIER.NOTES :\n1.\n2.C1\nR1 IOUT1\nIOUT2\nR1 =GAIN =R2 + R3\nR2R3\nR2\nR2R3\nR2 + R3\n \nFigure 53. Increasing the Gain of the Current Output DAC  \nDACS USED AS A DIVID ER OR PROGRAMMABLE \nGAIN ELEMENT  \nCurrent steering DACs are very flexible and lend themselves to many different applications. If this type of DAC is connected as \nthe f eedback element of an op amp and R\nFB is used as the input \nresistor, as shown in Figure 54, then the output voltage is \ninversely proportional to the digital input fraction, D.  \nFor D = 1 –  2–n the output voltage is  \nVOUT = –VIN/D = –VIN/(1 − 2–n) As D is reduced, the output voltage increases. For small values of D, it is important to ensure that the amplifier does not saturate \nand that the required accuracy is met.  \nFor example, in the circuit shown in Figure 54, an 8 -bit DAC \ndriven with the binary code 0x10 (00010000), that is, 16  decimal , \nmust  cause the output voltage to be 16 × V\nIN. However, if the \nDAC has a linearity specification of ± 0.5 LSB, then D can in fact \nhave a weight anywhere in the range 15.5/256 to 16.5/256 so \nthat the possible output voltage falls in the range 15.5 V IN to \n16.5 V IN—an error of 3% even though the DAC itself has a \nmaximum error of 0.2%.  \n03160-055GNDRFBVDD\nVDD\nVOUTVREFVIN\nNOTE:\nADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYIOUT1\nIOUT2\n \nFigure 54.

This paramete r not only affects the full -scale error, \nbut can also affect the linearity (INL and DNL) performance. \nThe reference temperature coefficient must  be consistent with \nthe system accuracy specifications. For example, an 8 -bit system \nrequired to hold its overal l specification to within 1 LSB over \nthe temperature range 0°C to 50°C dictates that the maximum \nsystem drift with temperature must  be less than 78 ppm/°C.  \nA 12 -bit system with the same temperature range to overall \nspecification within 2 LSBs requires a maximum drift of \n10 ppm/°C. By choosing a precision reference with low output \ntemperature coefficient this error source can be minimized. \nTable 9 suggests some references available from Analog Devices \nthat are suitable for use with this range of current output DACs.  \n \n \n \n AMPLIFIER SELECTION  \nThe primary requirement for the current- steering mode is an \namplifier with low input bias currents and low input offset \nvoltage. The input offset voltage of an op amp is multiplied by \nthe variable gain (due to the code dependent output resistance \nof the DAC) of the circuit. A change in the noise gain between \ntwo adjacent digital fractions produces a step change in the output  \nvoltage due to the amplifier’s input offset voltage. This output \nvoltage ch ange is superimposed on the desired change in output \nbetween the two codes and gives rise to a differential linearity \nerror, which, if large enough, can  cause the DAC to be non -\nmonotonic. In general, the input offset voltage must  be <1/4 \nLSB to ensure mono tonic behavior when stepping through codes.  \nThe input bias current of an op amp also generates an offset at the voltage output as a result of the bias current flowing into the feedback resistor, R\nFB. Most op amps have input bias currents \nlow enough to prev ent significant errors in 12 -bit applications.  \nCommon -mode rejection of the op amp is important in voltage -\nswitching circuits, since it produces a code dependent error at \nthe voltage output of the circuit. Most op amps have adequate \ncommon mode rejection for use at 8 -, 10-, and 12 -bit resolution.  \n \nData Sheet AD5424/AD5433/AD5445\n \nRev. E | Page 23 of 28 Provided the DAC switches are driven from true wideband \nlow impedance sources (V IN and AGND), they settle quickly. \nConsequently, the slew rate and settling time of a voltage switching DAC circuit is determined largely by the output op \namp. To obtain minimum settling time in this configuration, it \nis important to minimize capacitance at the V\nREF node (voltage \noutput node in this application) of the DAC. This is done by using \nlow inputs capacitance buffer amplifiers and careful board design. \nMost single-supply circuits include ground as part of the analog \nsignal range, which in turns requires an amplifier that can handle rail-to-rail signals. There is a large range of single-supply amplifiers available from Analog Devices. \nPARALLEL INTERFACE \nData is loaded to the AD5424/ AD5433/ AD5445  in the format \nof an 8-, 10-, or 12-bit parallel word. Control lines CS and R/ W \nallow data to be written to or read from the DAC register. A write event takes place when CS\n and R/ W are brought low, data \navailable on the data lines fills the shift register, and the rising \nedge of CS latches the data and transfers the latched data-word \nto the DAC register. The DAC latches are not transparent, thus a write sequence must consist of a falling and rising edge on CS\nto ensure that data is loaded to the DAC register and its analog \nequivalent is reflected on the DAC output. \nA read event takes place when R/ W is held high and CS is \nbrought low. New data is loaded from the DAC register back to \nthe input register and out onto the data line where it can be read \nback to the controller for verification or diagnostic purposes. \nMICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING \nADSP-2191M -to- AD5424/ AD5433/ AD5445 Interface \nFigure 55 shows the AD5424/ AD5433/ AD5445 interfaced to \nthe ADSP-2191M as a memory-mapped device.

Design t he printed circuit board on which \nthe AD5424 /AD5433/ AD5445 is mounted so that the analog \nand digital sections are separated and confined to certain areas \nof the board. If the DAC is in a system where multiple devices require an AGND -to-DGND connection, make the connection \nat one point o nly. Establish t he star ground point as close as \npossible to the device.  \nThese DACs must  have ample supply bypassing of 10 µF in \nparallel with 0.1 µF on the supply, located as close to the package  \nas possible and ideally right up  against the device. The 0.1 µF \ncapacitor must  have low effective series resistance (ESR) and \neffective series inductance (ESI), like the common ceramic types  \nthat provide a low impedance path to ground at high frequencies , \nto handle transient currents due to internal logic switching. Low \nESR 1 µF to 10 µF tantalum or electrolytic capacitors must  also be \napplied at the supplies to minimize transient disturbance and filter  \nout low frequency ripple.  Shield f ast sw itching signals such as clocks  with digital gr ound \nto avoid radiating noise to other parts of the board and must  \nnever be run near the reference inputs.  \nAvoid crossover of digital and analog signals.
