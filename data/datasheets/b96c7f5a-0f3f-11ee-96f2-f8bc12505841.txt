It can support IEEE802.3 10BASE-Te, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE-T Copper Ethernet \nprotocols, along with 100BASE-FX and 1000BASE-X Fiber Ethernet protocols.\nThe DP83869HM is designed for easy implementation of 10-Mbps, 100-Mbps, and 1000-Mbps Ethernet LANs. \nIn Copper mode, the PHY can interface with twisted-pair media through magnetics. In Fiber Mode, it can \ninterface with Fiber Optic Transceivers. This device interfaces directly to the MAC layer through the Reduced \nGMII (RGMII) or Serial GMII (SGMII). SGMII is available only in copper Ethernet mode. MII mode is supported \nfor 10M and 100M speeds.\nThe DP83869HM supports media convertor mode to interface between copper and fiber Ethernet interface. \nMedia convertor is available for 100M and 1000M speeds.\nThe DP83869HM can also support bridge mode to interface between SGMII and RGMII.\nThe DP83869HM offers low latency. It provides IEEE 1588 Start of Frame Delimiter indication. It has option to \nprovide recovered clock for synchronous Ethernet application.\nThe DP83869HM has a TDR cable diagnostic feature for fault detection on the Ethernet cable.DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\n1000BASE-X Block\n1000BASE-T Block\nDAC / ADC \nSUBSYSTEM\nDRIVERS / \nRECEIVERS100BASE-TX Block\nMLT-3 \n100 Mbps10BASE-Te BlockRGMII/MII Interface\nPAM-5 \n17 Level PR Shaped\n125 Msymbols/s\nCopper Ethernet \nPMD Connections RGMII/MII INTERFACE\nDAC / ADC \nTIMING BLOCKMGMT INTERFACE\nMDIO MDC Interrupt\nMGNT \n& PHY CNTRL\nWake on \nLAN\nAuto-\nNegotiation\nManchester \n10 Mbps\nTIMINGRX_CTRLRX_CLKTX_CTRL TXD[3:0]\nRXD[3:0]GTX_CLK/TX_CLK\nDRIVERS / RECEIVERSSGMII Interface\n100BASE-FX Block\nSOP SON SIP SIN\nFiber Ethernet PMD Connections\nOr\nSGMII ConnectionsRX_ERTX_ER\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n9.3 Feature Description\n9.3.1 WoL (Wake-on-LAN) Packet Detection\nWake-on-LAN provides a mechanism to detect specific frames and notify the connected MAC through either a \nregister status change, GPIO indication, or an interrupt flag. The WoL feature within the DP83869HM allows \nfor connected devices placed above the Physical Layer to remain in a low power state until frames with the \nqualifying credentials are detected. Supported WoL frame types include: Magic Packet, Magic Packet with \nSecureOn, and Custom Pattern Match. When a qualifying WoL frame is received, the DP83869HM WoL logic \ncircuit is able to generate a user-defined event (either pulses or level change) through any of the GPIO pins or a \nstatus interrupt flag to inform a connected controller that a wake event has occurred.\nThe Wake-on-LAN feature includes the following functionality:\n•Identification of magic packets in all supported speeds\n•Wake-up interrupt generation upon receiving a valid magic packet\n•CRC checking of magic packets to prevent interrupt generation for invalid packets\nIn addition to the basic magic packet support, the DP83869HM also supports:\n•Magic packets that include a SecureOn password\n•Pattern match – one configurable 64-byte pattern of that can wake up the MAC similar to magic packet\n•Independent configuration for Wake on Broadcast and Unicast packet types.\n9.3.1.1 Magic Packet Structure\nWhen configured for Magic Packet mode, the DP83869HM scans all incoming frames addressed to the node for \na specific data sequence. This sequence identifies the frame as a Magic Packet frame.\nNote\nThe Magic Packet should be byte aligned.\nA Magic Packet frame must also meet the basic requirements for the LAN technology chosen, such as SOURCE \nADDRESS, DESTINATION ADDRESS (which may be the receiving station’s IEEE address or a BROADCAST \naddress), and CRC.\nThe specific Magic Packet sequence consists of 16 duplications of the IEEE address of this node, with no \nbreaks or interruptions, followed by a SecureOn password if security is enabled. This sequence can be located \nanywhere within the packet, but must be preceded by a synchronization stream. The synchronization stream is \ndefined as 6 bytes of FFh.DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nDEST * 16DEST (6 bytes)\nSRC (6 bytes)\nMISC (X bytes, X >= 0)\n))«\x03))\x03 (6 bytes)\nMISC (Y bytes, Y >= 0)\nCRC (4 bytes)MAGIC pattern\nSecureOn Password (6 bytes) Only if Secure-On is enabledFigure 9-1.

Wake-on-LAN status is \nreported in the RXFSTS register (address 135h).\n9.3.2 Start of Frame Detect for IEEE 1588 Time Stamp\nThe DP83869HM supports an IEEE 1588 indication pulse at the SFD (start frame delimiter) for the receive and \ntransmit paths. The pulse can be delivered to various pins. The pulse indicates the actual time the symbol is \npresented on the lines (for transmit), or the first symbol received (for receive). The exact timing of the pulse can \nbe adjusted through register. Each increment of phase value is an 8-ns step.\nFigure 9-2. IEEE 1588 Message Timestamp Point\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nThe SFD pulse output can be configured using the GPIO Mux Control register GPIO_MUX_CTRL (register \naddress 1E0h). The ENHANCED_MAC_SUPPORT bit in RXCFG (register address 134h) must also be set to \nallow output of the SFD.\n9.3.2.1 SFD Latency Variation and Determinism\nTime stamping packet transmission and reception using the RX_CTRL and TX_CTRL signals of RGMII is not \naccurate enough for latency sensitive protocols. SFD pulses offers system designers a method to improve the \naccuracy of packet time stamping. The SFD pulse, while varying less than RGMII signals inherently, still exhibits \nlatency variation due to the defined architecture of 1000BASE-T. This section provides a method to determine \nwhen an SFD latency variation has occurred and how to compensate for the variation in system software to \nimprove timestamp accuracy.\nIn the following section the terms baseline latency and SFD variation are used. Baseline latency is the time \nmeasured between the TX_SFD pulse to the RX_SFD pulse of a connected link partner, assuming an Ethernet \ncable with all 4 pairs perfectly matched in propagation time. In the scenario where all 4 pairs being perfectly \nmatched, a 1000BASE-T PHY will not have to align the 4 received symbols on the wire and will not introduce \nextra latency due to alignment.\nTX SFD\nRX SFDBaseline Latency\nSFD Variation\nFigure 9-3. Baseline Latency and SFD Variation in Latency Measurement\nSFD variation is additional time added to the baseline latency before the RX_SFD pulse when the PHY must \nintroduce latency to align the 4 symbols from the Ethernet cable. Variation can occur when a new link is \nestablished either by cable connection, auto-negotiation restart, PHY reset, or other external system effects. \nDuring a single, uninterrupted link, the SFD variation will remain constant.\nThe DP83869HM can limit and report the variation applied to the SFD pulse while in the 1000-Mb operating \nmode. Before a link is established in 1000-Mb mode, the Sync FIFO Control Register (register address E9h) \nmust be set to value 0xDF22. The below SFD variation compensation method can only be applied after the \nSync FIFO Control Register has been initialized and a new link has been established. It is acceptable to set the \nSync FIFO Control register value and then perform a software restart by setting the SW_RESTART bit[14] in the \nControl Register (register address 1Fh) if a link is already present.\n9.3.2.1.1 1000-Mb SFD Variation in Master Mode\nWhen the DP83869HM is operating in 1000-Mb master mode, variation of the RX_SFD pulse can be estimated \nusing the Skew FIFO Status register (register address 55h) bit[7:4]. The value read from the Skew FIFO Status \nregister bit[7:4] must be multiplied by 8 ns to estimate the RX_SFD variation added to the baseline latency.\nExample: While operating in master 1000-Mb mode, a value of 0x2 is read from the Skew FIFO register bit[7:4].\n2 × 8 ns = 16 ns is subtracted from the TX_SFD to RX_SFD measurement to determine the baseline latency.\n9.3.2.1.2 1000-Mb SFD Variation in Slave Mode\nWhen the DP83869HM is operating in 1000-Mb slave mode, the variation of the RX_SFD pulse can be \ndetermined using the Skew FIFO Status register (register address 55h) bit[3:0].The value read from the Skew \nFIFO Status register bit[3:0] should be multiplied by 8ns to estimate the RX_SFD variation added to the baseline \nlatency.\nExample: While operating in slave 1000-Mb mode, a value of 0x1 is read from the Skew FIFO register bit[3:0].\n1 × 8 ns = 8 ns is subtracted from the TX_SFD to RX_SFD measurement to determine the baseline latency.DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n9.3.2.1.3 100-Mb SFD Variation\nThe latency variation in 100-Mb mode of operation is determined by random process and does not require any \nregister readout or system level compensation of SFD pulses.\n9.3.3 Clock Output\nThe DP83869HM has several internal clocks, including the local reference clock, the Ethernet transmit clock, \nand the Ethernet receive clock. An external crystal or oscillator provides the stimulus for the local reference \nclock. The local reference clock acts as the central source for all clocking in the device.\nThe local reference clock is embedded into the transmit network packet traffic and is recovered from the network \npacket traffic at the receiver node. The receive clock is recovered from the received Ethernet packet data stream \nand is locked to the transmit clock in the partner.\nUsing the I/O Configuration register (address 170h), the DP83869HM can be configured to output these internal \nclocks through the CLK_OUT pin. By default, the output clock is synchronous to the XI oscillator / crystal input. \nThe default output clock is suitable for use as the reference clock of another DP83869HM device. Through \nregisters, the output clock can be configured to be synchronous to the receive data at the 125-MHz data rate \nor at the divide by 5 rate of 25 MHz. It can also be configured to output the line driver transmit clock. When \noperating in 1000Base-T mode, the output clock can be configured for any of the four transmit or receive \nchannels.\nIt is important to note that when clock output of DP83869HM is being used as a clock input for another device, \nfor e.g. two DP83869HM in daisy chain, then the primary DP83869HM should not be reset via the RESET \npin. If reset is required then it should be performed via software. The output clock can be disabled using the \nCLK_O_DISABLE bit of the I/O Configuration register.\n9.3.4 Loopback Mode\nThere are several options for Loopback that test and verify various functional blocks within the PHY. Enabling \nloopback mode allows in-circuit testing of the digital and analog data paths. Generally, the DP83869HM may \nbe configured to one of the Near-end loopback modes or to the Far-end (reverse) loopback. MII Loopback \nis configured using the BMCR (register address 0h). All other loopback modes are enabled using the \nBIST_CONTROL (register address 16h). Except where otherwise noted, loopback modes are supported for \nall speeds (10/100/1000) and all MAC interfaces (SGMII and RGMII).\nMAC\nMII\nLoopbackMII\nPCS\nSignal\nProcessing\nAFE\nTransformer\nRJ-45\n12345678\nDigital\nLoopbackPCS\nLoopbackAnalog\nLoopback\nExternal\nLoopbackReverse\nLoopback\nOnly in 10Base-Te \nand 100Base-TX.\nFigure 9-4. Loopbacks\n9.3.4.1 Near-End Loopback\nNear-end loopback provides the ability to loop the transmitted data back to the receiver through the digital or \nanalog circuitry. The point at which the signal is looped back is selected using loopback control bits with several \noptions being provided.\nWhen configuring loopback modes, the Loopback Configuration Register (LOOPCR), address FEh, should be \nset to 0xE720.\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nTo maintain the desired operating mode, Auto-Negotiation should be disabled before selecting the Near-End \nLoopback mode. This constraint does not apply for external-loopback mode.\nAuto-MDIX should be disabled before selecting the Near-End Loopback mode. MDI or MDIX configuration \nshould be manually configured.\n9.3.4.1.1 MII Loopback\nMII Loopback is the shallowest loop through the PHY. It is a useful test mode to validate communications \nbetween the MAC and the PHY. While in MII Loopback mode, the data is looped back and can be configured \nthrough the register to transmit onto the media. In 100Base-TX mode after MII loopback is enabled through \nregister 0h, it is necessary to write 0x4 to register 16h for proper operation of MII Loopback.\n9.3.4.1.2 PCS Loopback\nPCS Loopback occurs in the PCS layer of the PHY. No signal processing is performed when using PCS \nLoopback.\n9.3.4.1.3 Digital Loopback\nDigital Loopback includes the entire digital transmit – receive path. Data is looped back prior to the analog \ncircuitry.\n9.3.4.1.4 Analog Loopback\nAnalog Loopback includes the entire analog transmit-receive path. For proper operation in Analog Loopback \nmode, attach 100- Ω terminations to the copper side when operating in Copper mode and 100- Ω termination on \nfiber side when operating in Fiber mode.\n9.3.4.1.5 External Loopback\nWhen operating in 10BASE-Te or 100Base-T mode, signals can be looped back at the RJ-45 connector by \nwiring the transmit pins to the receive pins. Due to the nature of the signaling in 1000Base-T mode, this type \nof external loopback is not supported. Analog loopback provides a way to loop data back in the analog circuitry \nwhen operating in 1000Base-T mode.\n9.3.4.1.6 Far-End (Reverse) Loopback\nFar-end (Reverse) Loopback is a special test mode to allow testing the PHY from the link-partner side. In this \nmode, data that is received from the link partner passes through the PHY\'s receiver is looped back at the MAC \ninterface and is transmitted back to the link partner. While in Reverse Loopback mode, all data signals that come \nfrom the MAC are ignored. Through register configuration, data can also be transmitted onto the MAC Interface.\nThe availability of Loopback depends on the operational mode of the PHY. The Link Status in these loopback \nmodes is also affected by the operational mode. Table 9-1  lists out the exceptions where Loopbacks are not \navailable.\nTable 9-1.

The BIST circuit can be used to test the integrity of the transmit and receive data paths. The BIST \ncan be performed using both internal loopback (digital or analog) or external loopback using a cable fixture. The \nBIST simulates pseudo-random data transfer scenarios in format of real packets and Inter-Packet Gap (IPG) on \nthe lines. The BIST allows full control of the packet lengths and of the IPG.\nThe BIST is implemented with independent transmit and receive paths, with the transmit block generating a \ncontinuous stream of a pseudo-random sequence. The device generates a 15-bit pseudo-random sequence for \nthe BIST. The received data is compared to the generated pseudo-random data by the BIST Linear Feedback \nShift Register (LFSR) to determine the BIST pass or fail status. The number of error bytes that the PRBS \nchecker received is stored in the PRBS_TX_CHK_CTRL register (39h). The status of whether the PRBS checker \nis locked to the incoming receive bit stream, whether the PRBS has lost sync, and whether the packet generator \nis busy, can be read from the GEN_STATUS2 register (17h). While the lock and sync indications are required \nto identify the beginning of proper data reception, for any link failures or data corruption, the best indication is \nthe contents of the error counter in the PRBS_TX_CHK_CTRL register (39h). The number of received bytes are \nstored in PRBS_TX_CHK_BYTE_CNT (3Ah).\nThe PRBS test can be put in a continuous mode by using the BIST_CONTROL register (16h). In continuous \nmode, when one of the PRBS counters reaches the maximum value, the counter starts counting from zero \nagain. PRBS mode is not applicable in Bridge Modes and should not be used.\n9.3.6 Interrupt\nThe DP83869HM can be configured to generate an interrupt when changes of internal status occur. The interrupt \nallows a MAC to act upon the status in the PHY without polling the PHY registers. The interrupt source can be \nselected through the interrupt registers, MICR (12h) and FIBER_INT_EN (C18h). The interrupt status can be \nread from ISR (13h) and FIBER_INT_STTS (C19h) registers. Some interrupts are enabled by default and can \nbe disabled through register access. Both the interrupt status registers must be read in order to clear pending \ninterrupts. Until the pending interrupts are cleared, new interrupts may not be routed to the interrupt pin.\n9.3.7 Power-Saving Modes\nDP83869HM supports four power saving modes. The details are provided below.\n9.3.7.1 IEEE Power Down\nThe PHY is powered down but access to the PHY through MDIO-MDC pins is retained. This mode can be \nactivated by asserting external PWDN pin or by setting bit 11 of BMCR (Register 0h).\nThe PHY can be taken out of this mode by a power cycle, software reset, or by clearing the bit 11 in BMCR \nregister. However, the external PWDN pin should be deasserted. If the PWDN pin is kept asserted then the PHY \nremains in power down.\n9.3.7.2 Active Sleep\nIn this mode, all the digital and analog blocks are powered down. The PHY is automatically powered up when \na link partner is detected. This mode is useful for saving power when the link partner is down or inactive, but \nPHY cannot be powered down. In Active Sleep mode, the PHY still routinely sends NLP to the link partner. This \nmode can be active by writing 10b to bits [9:8] for PHYCR (Register 10h). Sleep mode cannot be used when \nAuto-MDIX is on.\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n9.3.7.3 Passive Sleep\nThis is just like Active sleep except the PHY does not send NLP. This mode can be activated by writing 11b to \nbits [9:8] PHYCR (Register 10h). Sleep mode cannot be used when Auto-MDIX is on.\n9.3.8 Mirror Mode\nIn some applications, the orientation of the cable connector can require Copper PMD traces to cross over each \nother. This complicates the board layout. The DP83869HM can resolve this issue by implementing mirroring of \nthe ports inside the device.\nIn 10/100 operation, the mapping of the port mirroring is shown in Table 9-2 . When using mirror mode in \n100-Mbps mode, TI recommends that the user read register 0xA1 and write the same value in register A0h.\nTable 9-2. Mirror Port Configurations in 10/100 Operation\nMDI MODE MIRROR PORT CONFIGURATION\nMDI A → D\nB → C\nMDIX A → D\nB → C\nIn Gigabit operation, the mapping of the port mirroring is shown in Table 9-3 .\nTable 9-3. Mirror Port Configurations in Gigabit Operation\nMDI MODE MIRROR PORT CONFIGURATION\nMDI or MDIX A → D\nB → C\nC → B\nD → A\nMirror mode can be enabled through strap or through register configuration using the Port Mirror Enable bit in \nthe CFG4 register (address 31h). In Mirror mode, the polarity of the signals is also reversed.\n9.3.9 Speed Optimization\nSpeed optimization, also known as link downshift, enables fallback to 100M operation after multiple consecutive \nfailed attempts at Gigabit link establishment. Such a case could occur if cabling with only four wires (two twisted \npairs) were connected instead of the standard cabling with eight wires (four twisted pairs).\nThe number of failed link attempts before falling back to 100M operation is configurable. By default, four failed \nlink attempts are required before falling back to 100M.\nIn enhanced mode, fallback to 100M can occur after one failed link attempt if energy is not detected on the C \nand D channels. Speed optimization also supports fallback to 10M if link establishment fails in Gigabit and in \n100M mode.\nSpeed optimization can be enabled through register configuration.\n9.3.10 Cable Diagnostics\nWith the vast deployment of Ethernet devices, the need for reliable, comprehensive and user-friendly cable \ndiagnostic tool is more important than ever. The wide variety of cables, topologies, and connectors deployed \nresults in the need to non-intrusively identify and report cable faults. The DP83869HM offers Time Domain \nReflectometry (TDR) for Cable Diagnostics.\n9.3.10.1 TDR\nThe DP83869HM uses Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) to determine the quality of the cables, connectors, \nand terminations in addition to estimating the cable length. Some of the possible problems that can be DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\ndiagnosed include opens, shorts, cable impedance mismatch, bad connectors, termination mismatches, cross \nfaults, cross shorts, and any other discontinuities along the cable.\nThe DP83869HM transmits a test pulse of known amplitude down each of the two pairs of an attached cable. \nThe transmitted signal continues down the cable and reflects from each cable imperfection, fault, bad connector, \nand from the end of the cable itself. After the pulse transmission, the DP83869HM measures the return time \nand amplitude of all these reflected pulses. This technique enables measuring the distance and magnitude \n(impedance) of non-terminated cables (open or short), discontinuities (bad connectors), improperly-terminated \ncables, and crossed pairs wires with ±1-m accuracy.\nThe DP83869HM also uses data averaging to reduce noise and improve accuracy. The DP83869HM can record \nup to five reflections within the tested pair. If more than 5 reflections are recorded, the DP83869HM saves \nthe first 5 of them. If a cross fault is detected, the TDR saves the first location of the cross fault and up to 4 \nreflections in the tested channel. The DP83869HM TDR can measure cables beyond 100 m in length.\nFor all TDR measurements, the transformation between time of arrival and physical distance is done by the \nexternal host using minor computations (such as multiplication, addition, and lookup tables). The host must know \nthe expected propagation delay of the cable, which depends, among other things, on the cable category (for \nexample, CAT5, CAT5e, or CAT6).\nTDR measurement is allowed in the DP83869HM in the following scenarios:\n•While Link partner is disconnected – cable is unplugged at the other side\n•Link partner is connected but remains quiet  (for example, in power-down mode)\n•TDR could be automatically activated when the link fails or is dropped by setting bit 7 of register 9h (CFG1). \nThe results of the TDR run after the link fails are saved in the TDR registers.\nSoftware could read these registers at any time to apply post processing on the TDR results. This mode is \ndesigned for cases when the link is dropped due to cable disconnections. After a link failure, for instance, the line \nis quiet to allow a proper function of the TDR.\n9.3.11 Fast Link Drop\nThe DP83869HM includes advanced link-down capabilities that support various real-time applications. The link \ndown mechanism is configurable and includes enhanced modes that allow extremely fast reaction times to link \ndrops.\nValid Data LOW Quality Data / Link Loss\nT1First Link Failure\nOccurrence\nLink DropSignal\nLink Loss\nIndication\n(Link LED)\nFigure 9-5. Fast Link Drop Mechanism\nAs described in Figure 9-5 , the link loss mechanism is based on a time window search period in which the signal \nbehavior is monitored. The T1 window is set by default to reduce typical link drops to less than 1 ms in 100M and \n0.5 ms in 1000M mode.\nThe DP83869HM supports enhanced modes that shorten the window called Fast Link Down mode. In this mode, \nthe T1 window is shortened significantly, in most cases less than 10 μs. In this period of time, there are several \ncriteria allowed to generate link loss event and drop the link:\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n1.Loss of descrambler sync\n2.Receive errors\n3.MLT3 errors\n4.Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n5.Energy loss\nThe Fast Link Down functionality allows the use of each of these options separately or in any combination. Note \nthat because this mode enables extremely quick reaction time, it is more exposed to temporary bad link quality \nscenarios.\n9.3.12 Jumbo Frames\nConventional Ethernet frames have a maximum size of about 1518 bytes. Jumbo Frames are special packets \nwith size higher than 1518 bytes, often ranging into several thousands of bytes. Jumbo frames allow Ethernet \nsystems to transfer large chunks of data in a single frame reducing the processor overhead and increasing \nbandwidth efficiency. DP83869 supports Jumbo frames in 1000Mbps and 100Mbps speeds.DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n32 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\n9.4.1 Copper Ethernet\n9.4.1.1 1000BASE-T\nThe DP83869HM supports the 1000BASE-T standard as defined by the IEEE 802.3 standard. In 1000M mode, \nthe PHY will use four MDI channels for communication. The 1000BASE-T can work in Auto-Negotiation mode. \nThe PHY can be configured in 1000BASE-T through the register settings ( Section 9.4.8 ) or strap settings \n(Section 9.5.1.2 ).\n9.4.1.2 100BASE-TX\nThe DP83869HM supports the 100BASE-TX standard as defined by the IEEE 802.3 standard. In 100M mode, \nthe PHY will use two MDI channels for communication. The 100BASE-TX can work in Auto-Negotiation mode \nor in force mode. The PHY can be configured in 100BASE-TX through the register settings ( Section 9.4.8 ) or \nstrap settings ( Section 9.5.1.2 ). When using DP83869 in force 100Base-TX mode, it is required to enable Robust \nAuto-MDIX feature from register 1Eh.\n9.4.1.3 10BASE-Te\nThe DP83869HM supports the 10BASE-Te standard as defined by the IEEE 802.3 standard. In 100M mode, \nthe PHY will use two MDI channels for communication. The 10BASE-Te can work in Auto-Negotiation mode or \nin force mode. The PHY can be configured in 10BASE-Te through the register settings ( Section 9.4.8 ) or strap \nsettings ( Section 9.5.1.2 ).\n9.4.2 Fiber Ethernet\n9.4.2.1 1000BASE-X\nThe DP83869HM supports the 1000Base-X Fiber Ethernet protocol as defined in IEEE 802.3 standard. In \n1000M Fiber mode, the PHY will use two differential channels for communication. In fiber mode, the speed is not \ndecided through auto-negotiation. Both sides of the link must be configured to the same operating speed. The \nPHY can be configured to operate in 1000BASE-X through the register settings ( Section 9.4.8 ) or strap settings \n(Section 9.5.1.2 ).\n9.4.2.2 100BASE-FX\nThe DP83869HM supports the 100Base-FX Fiber Ethernet protocol as defined in IEEE 802.3 standard. In 100M \nFiber mode, the PHY will use two differential channels for communication. In fiber mode, the speed is not \ndecided through auto-negotiation. Both sides of the link must be configured to the same operating speed. The \nPHY can be configured to operate in 100BASE-X through register settings ( Section 9.4.8 ) or strap settings \n(Section 9.5.1.2 ).\n9.4.3 Serial GMII (SGMII)\nThe Serial Gigabit Media Independent Interface (SGMII) provides a means of conveying network data and port \nspeed between a 100/1000 PHY and a MAC with significantly less signal pins (4 or 6 pins) than required for \nGMII (24 pins) or RGMII (12 pins). The SGMII interface uses 1.25-Gbps LVDS differential signaling which has \nthe added benefit of reducing EMI emissions relative to GMII or RGMII.\nBecause the internal clock and data recovery circuitry (CDR) of DP83869HM can detect the transmit timing of \nthe SGMII data, TX_CLK is not required. The DP83869HM will support only 4-wire SGMII mode. Two differential \npairs are used for the transmit and receive connections. Clock and data recovery are performed in the MAC and \nin the PHY, so no additional differential pair is required for clocking.\nThe 1.25-Gbps rate of SGMII is excessive for 100-Mbps and 10-Mbps operation. When operating in 100-Mbps \nmode, the PHY elongates  the frame by replicating each frame byte 10 times and when in 10-Mbps mode the \nPHY elongates  the frame by replicating each frame byte 100 times. This frame elongation takes place above  the \nIEEE 802.3 PCS layer, thus the start of frame delimiter only appears once per frame.\nThe SGMII interface includes Auto-Negotiation capability. Auto-Negotiation provides a mechanism for control \ninformation to be exchanged between the PHY and the MAC. This allows the interface to be automatically \nconfigured based on the media speed mode resolution on the MDI side. In MAC loopback mode, the SGMII \nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 33\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nspeed is determined by the MDI speed selection. The SGMII interface works in both Auto-Negotiation and forced \nspeed mode during the MAC loopback operation. SGMII Auto-Negotiation is the default mode of the operation.\nThe SGMII Auto-Negotiation process can be disabled and the SGMII speed mode can be forced to the MDI \nresolved speed. The SGMII forced speed mode can be enabled with the MDI auto-negotiation or MDI manual \nspeed mode. SGMII Auto-Negotiation can be disabled through the SGMII_AUTONEG_EN register bit in the \nCFG2 register (address 14h).\nThe 10M_SGMII_RATE_ADAPT bit (bit 7) of 10M_SGMII_CFG register (16Fh) needs to be cleared for enabling \n10M SGMII operation.\nSGMII is enabled through a resistor strap option. See Section 9.5.1  for details.\nAll SGMII connections must be AC-coupled through an 0.1-µF capacitor.\nThe connection diagrams for 4-wire SGMII is shown in Figure 9-6 .\nNote\nMII Isolate (bit 10 in register 0h) will not isolate SGMII pins. SGMII can be disabled through register \n1DFh for isolating SGMII pins.\nPHY\nSGMII_SIP\nSGMII_SIN\nSGMII_SOP\nSGMII_SONMAC\n0.1 µF\n0.1 µF\n0.1 µF\n0.1 µF\nFigure 9-6. SGMII 4-Wire Connections\n9.4.4 Reduced GMII (RGMII)\nThe Reduced Gigabit Media Independent Interface (RGMII) is designed to reduce the number of pins required \nto interconnect the MAC and PHY (12 pins for RGMII relative to 24 pins for GMII). To accomplish this goal, the \ndata paths and all associated control signals are reduced and are multiplexed. Both rising and trailing edges \nof the clock are used. For Gigabit operation, the GTX_CLK and RX_CLK clocks are 125 MHz, and for 10- and \n100-Mbps operation, the clock frequencies are 2.5 MHz and 25 MHz, respectively.\nFor more information about RGMII timing, see the RGMII Interface Timing Budgets  application report \n(SNLA243).DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n34 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n9.4.4.1 1000-Mbps Mode Operation\nAll RGMII signals are positive logic. The 8-bit data is multiplexed by taking advantage of both clock edges. The \nlower 4 bits are latched on the positive clock edge and the upper 4 bits are latched on trailing clock edge. The \ncontrol signals are multiplexed into a single clock cycle using the same technique.\nTo reduce power consumption of RGMII interface, (TX_EN - TX_ER) and (RX_DV - RX_ER) are encoded in a \nmanner that minimizes transitions during normal network operation. TX_CTRL pin will denote TX_EN on rising \nedge of GTX_CLK and will denote a logic derivative of TX_EN and TX_ER on the falling edge of GTX_CLK. \nRX_CTRL will denote RX_DV on rising edge of RX_CLK and will denote a logic derivative of RX_DV and \nRX_ER on the falling edge of RX_CLK. The encoding for the TX_ER and RX_ER is given in Equation 1  and \nEquation 2 :\nTX_ER = GMII_TX_ER (XOR) GMII_TX_EN (1)\nwhere\n•GMII_TX_ER and GMII_TX_EN are logical equivalent signals in GMII standard.\nRX_ER = GMII_RX_ER (XOR) GMII_RX_DV (2)\nwhere\n•GMII_RX_ER, and GMII_RX_DV are logical equivalent signals in GMII standard.\nWhen receiving a valid frame with no error, RX_CTRL = True  is generated as a logic high on the rising edge of \nRX_CLK and RX_CTRL = False  is generated as a logic high at the falling edge of RX_CLK. When no frame is \nbeing received, RX_CTRL = False  is generated as a logic low on the rising edge of RX_CLK and RX_CTRL = \nFalse  is generated as a logic low on the falling edge of RX_CLK.\nThe TX_CTRL is treated in a similar manner. During normal frame transmission, the signal stays at a logic high \nfor both edges of GTX_CLK and during the period between frames where no error is indicated, the signal stays \nlow for both edges.\n9.4.4.2 1000-Mbps Mode Timing\nThe DP83869HM provides configurable clock skew for the GTX_CLK and RX_CLK to optimize timing across the \ninterface. The transmit and receive paths can be optimized independently. Both the transmit and receive path \nsupport 16 programmable RGMII delay modes through register configuration.\nThe timing paths can either be configured for Aligned mode or Shift mode. In Aligned mode, no clock skew \nis introduced. In Shift mode, the clock skew can be introduced in 0.5-ns increments or in 0.25-ns increments \n(through register configuration). Configuration of the Aligned mode or Shift mode is accomplished through the \nRGMII Control Register (RGMIICTL), address 32h. In Shift mode, the clock skew can be adjusted using the \nRGMII Delay Control Register (RGMIIDCTL), address 86h. By default RGMII shift mode will be activated. Both \ntransmit and receive signals will be delayed by 2ns.\n9.4.4.3 10- and 100-Mbps Mode\nWhen the RGMII interface is operating in the 100-Mbps mode, the RGMII clock rate is reduced to 25 MHz. For \n10-Mbps operation, the clock is further reduced to 2.5 MHz. In the RGMII 10/100 mode, the transmit clock RGMII \nTX_CLK is generated by the MAC and the receive clock RGMII RX_CLK is generated by the PHY. During the \npacket receiving operation, the RGMII RX_CLK may be stretched on either the positive or negative pulse to \naccommodate the transition from the free-running clock to a data synchronous clock domain. When the speed of \nthe PHY changes, a similar stretching of the positive or negative pulses is allowed. No glitch is allowed on the \nclock signals during clock speed transitions.\nThis interface operates at 10- and 100-Mbps speeds the same way it does at 1000-Mbps mode with the \nexception that the data may be duplicated on the falling edge of the appropriate clock.\nThe MAC holds the RGMII TX_CLK low until it has ensured that it is operating at the same speed as the PHY.\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 35\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nPHY\nTX_CTRL\nGTX_CLK\nTX_D [3:0]\nRX_CTRL\nRX_CLK\nRX_D [3:0]MACFigure 9-7.

The user will have to \nensure that the PHY links in either 100-Mbps or 10-Mbps mode. MII mode cannot be used in 1000-Mbps mode. \nWhen using auto-negotiation to resolve MDI speed, TI recommends to turn off the gigabit speed advertisement \nthrough register 0x9 to ensure that the PHY does not link up at 1000-Mbps speed. The Media Independent \nInterface is a synchronous 4-bit wide nibble data interface that connects the PHY to the MAC in 100BASE-FX, \n100BASE-TX and 10BASE-Te modes . The RX_ER signal must be properly muxed by setting Register 18h to \nequal 0xE. The MII is fully compliant with IEEE 802.3-2002 clause 22.\nThe MII signals are summarized in Table 9-4 :\nTable 9-4.

In this mode, DP83869HM will configure SGMII in Auto Mode. In \nAuto mode, the RGMII side will automatically adjust to the link-up speed on the SGMII side. In case where the \nPHY is does not have a link, the RGMII clock frequency will default to 2.5 MHz.\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 37\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nAfter auto-negotiation is completed on the PHY side, the link capabilities are communicated to DP83869HM over \nthe SGMII interface.

In this mode, DP83869HM will configure SGMII in Auto. In Auto \nmode, SGMII will adapt the link speed based on RGMII.\nAfter auto-negotiation is completed on the PHY side, the link capabilities are communicated to DP83869HM over \nthe RGMII interface. However, this information needs to be conveyed to the Ethernet MAC as well. The MAC can \nread this information from the DP83869HM through the registers.\nIn SGMII-to-RGMII Bridge mode, the DP83869 will act as RGMII MAC for the Ethernet PHY. The DP83869 RX \npins will act as output pins from the DP83869 to the Ethernet PHY TX pins, and the DP83869 TX pins will act as \ninput pins for the Ethernet PHY RX pins.\nIn both Bridge modes, PRBS mode of the PHY is not applicable and should not be used.\nLEDs, if used, will indicate status on the RGMII side in both Bridge Modes.\n9.4.7 Media Convertor Mode\nIn media convertor mode, DP83869HM will translate data between copper and fiber interface for 1000M \nand 100M speeds. Media convertor mode can be activated through the straps. The DP83869HM supports \nUnmanaged Media Convertor mode.\nDP83869Copper\nLink PartnerCopper \nCableFiber \nCable Fiber\nLink Partner\nFigure 9-11.

Register access to the PHY is \nretained. This provides additional flexibility to use other features supported by the PHY.\nCopper interface will support auto-negotiation, but the user will have to ensure that the speed negotiated on the \ncopper side matches the speed fixed on the fiber side. In cases of speed mismatch between copper and fiber, \ninterface data transmission will not be successful.\nThe DP83869HM also supports Link Loss Pass Through in 100M mode. In a network containing two media \nconvertors where the link is dropped on one end of the system, a link loss indication is passed through all the DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n38 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nway to the far end.

The SMI is compatible with IEEE 802.3-2002 clause 22. The implemented register \nset consists of the registers required by the IEEE 802.3, plus several others to provide additional visibility and \ncontrollability of the DP83869HM device.\nThe SMI includes the MDC management clock input and the management MDIO data pin. The MDC clock is \nsourced by the external management entity, also called Station (STA), and can run at a maximum clock rate of \n25 MHz. MDC is not expected to be continuous, and can be turned off by the external management entity when \nthe bus is idle.\nThe MDIO is sourced by the external management entity and by the PHY. The data on the MDIO pin is latched \non the rising edge of the MDC clock. The MDIO pin requires a pullup resistor (2.2 k Ω) which, during IDLE and \nturnaround, pulls MDIO high.\nUp to 16 PHYs can share a common SMI bus. To distinguish between the PHYs, a 4-bit address is used. During \npower-up reset, the DP83869HM latches the PHY_ADD configuration pins to determine its address.\nThe management entity must not start an SMI transaction in the first cycle after power-up reset. To maintain \nvalid operation, the SMI bus must remain inactive at least one MDC cycle after hard reset is deasserted. In \nnormal MDIO transactions, the register address is taken directly from the management-frame reg_addr field, \nthus allowing direct access to 32 16-bit registers (including those defined in IEEE 802.3 and vendor specific). \nThe data field is used for both reading and writing. The Start code is indicated by a <01> pattern. This pattern \nmakes sure that the MDIO line transitions from the default idle line state. Turnaround is defined as an idle \nbit time inserted between the Register Address field and the Data field. To avoid contention during a read \ntransaction, no device may actively drive the MDIO signal during the first bit of turnaround. The addressed \nDP83869HM drives the MDIO with a zero for the second bit of turnaround and follows this with the required data. \nFigure 9-13  shows the timing relationship between MDC and the MDIO as driven and received by the Station \n(STA) and the DP83869HM (PHY) for a typical register read access.\nFor write transactions, the station-management entity writes data to the addressed DP83869, thus eliminating \nthe requirement for MDIO turnaround. The turnaround time is filled by the management entity by inserting <10>. \nFigure 9-13  shows the timing relationship for a typical MII register write access. The frame structure and general \nread and write transactions are shown in Table 9-5 , Figure 9-13 , and Figure 9-14 .\nTable 9-5.

Typical MDC/MDIO Read Operation\nFigure 9-14. Typical MDC/MDIO Write Operation\n9.4.9.1 Extended Address Space Access\nThe DP83869HM SMI function supports read or write access to the extended register set using registers \nREGCR (Dh) and ADDAR (Eh) and the MDIO Manageable Device (MMD) indirect method defined in IEEE \n802.3ah Draft for clause 22 for accessing the clause 45 extended register set.\nThe standard register set, MDIO registers 0 to 31, is accessed using the normal direct-MDIO access or the \nindirect method, except for register REGCR (Dh) and ADDAR (Eh) which is accessed only using the normal \nMDIO transaction. The SMI function ignores indirect accesses to these registers.\nREGCR (Dh) is the MDIO Manageable MMD access control. In general, register REGCR(4:0) is the device \naddress DEVAD that directs any accesses of ADDAR (Eh) register to the appropriate MMD.\nThe DP83869HM supports one MMD device address. The vendor-specific device address DEVAD[4:0] = 11111 \nis used for general MMD register accesses.\nAll accesses through registers REGCR and ADDAR must use the correct DEVAD. Transactions with other \nDEVAD are ignored. REGCR[15:14] holds the access function: address (00), data with no post increment (01), \ndata with post increment on read and writes (10) and data with post increment on writes only (11).\n•ADDAR is the address and data MMD register. ADDAR is used in conjunction with REGCR to provide \nthe access to the extended register set. If register REGCR[15:1] is 00, then ADDAR holds the address of \nthe extended address space register. Otherwise, ADDAR holds the data as indicated by the contents of \nits address register. When REGCR[15:14] is set to 00, accesses to register ADDAR modify the extended \nregister set address register. This address register must always be initialized to access any of the registers \nwithin the extended register set.\n•When REGCR[15:14] is set to 01, accesses to register ADDAR access the register within the extended \nregister set selected by the value in the address register.\n•When REGCR[15:14] is set to 10, access to register ADDAR access the register within the extended register \nset selected by the value in the address register. After that access is complete, for both reads and writes, the \nvalue in the address register is incremented.\n•When REGCR[15:14] is set to 11, access to register ADDAR access the register within the extended register \nset selected by the value in the address register. After that access is complete, for write accesses only, the \nvalue in the address register is incremented. For read accesses, the value of the address register remains \nunchanged.\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 41\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nThe following sections describe how to perform operations on the extended register set using register REGCR \nand ADDAR.

The Auto-Negotiation function in 1000BASE-T \nhas three primary purposes:\n•Auto-Negotiation of Speed and Duplex Selection\n•Auto-Negotiation of Master or Slave Resolution\n•Auto-Negotiation of Pause or Asymetrical Pause Resolution\n9.4.10.1 Speed and Duplex Selection - Priority Resolution\nThe Auto-Negotiation function provides a mechanism for exchanging configuration information between the two \nends of a link segment. This mechanism is implemented by exchanging Fast Link Pulses (FLP). FLPs are burst \npulses that provide the signaling used to communicate the abilities between two devices at each end of a link \nsegment. For further details regarding Auto-Negotiation, refer to Clause 28 of the IEEE 802.3 specification. \nThe DP83869HM supports 1000BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE-T modes of operation. The process of \nAuto-Negotiation ensures that the highest performance protocol is selected (that is, priority resolution) based on \nthe advertised abilities of the Link Partner and the local device.\n9.4.10.2 Master and Slave Resolution\nIf 1000BASE-T mode is selected during the priority resolution, the second goal of Auto-Negotiation is to resolve \nMaster or Slave configuration. The Master mode priority is given to the device that supports multiport nodes, \nsuch as switches and repeaters. Single node devices such as DTE or NIC card takes lower Master mode priority.\n9.4.10.3 Pause and Asymmetrical Pause Resolution\nWhen Full-Duplex operation is selected during priority resolution, the Auto-Negotiation also determines the Flow \nControl capabilities of the two link partners. Flow control was originally introduced to force a busy station’s \nLink Partner to stop transmitting data in Full-Duplex operation. Unlike Half-Duplex mode of operation where \na link partner could be forced to back off by simply generating collisions, the Full-Duplex operation needed a \nmechanism to slow down transmission from a link partner in the event that the receiving station’s buffers are \nbecoming full. A new MAC control layer was added to handle the generation and reception of Pause Frames. \nEach MAC Controller has to advertise whether it is capable of processing Pause Frames. In addition, the MAC \nController advertises if Pause frames can be handled in both directions, that is, receive and transmit. If the MAC \nController only generates Pause frames but does not respond to Pause frames generated by a link partner, \nit is called Asymmetrical Pause. The advertisement of Pause and Asymmetrical Pause capabilities is enabled \nby writing 1 to bits 10 and 11 of ANAR (register address 4h). The link partner’s Pause capabilities is stored in \nANLPAR (register address 5h) bits 10 and 11. The MAC Controller has to read from ANLPAR to determine which \nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 43\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nPause mode to operate. The PHY layer is not involved in Pause resolution other than simply advertising and \nreporting of Pause capabilities.\n9.4.10.4 Next Page Support\nThe DP83869HM supports the Auto-Negotiation Next Page protocol as required by IEEE 802.3 clause \n28.2.4.1.7. The ANNPTR 7h allows for the configuration and transmission of the Next Page. Refer to clause \n28 of the IEEE 802.3 standard for detailed information regarding the Auto-Negotiation Next Page function.\n9.4.10.5 Parallel Detection\nThe DP83869HM supports the Parallel Detection function as defined in the IEEE 802.3 specification. Parallel \nDetection requires the 10/100-Mbps receivers to monitor the receive signal and report link status to the Auto-\nNegotiation function. Auto-Negotiation uses this information to configure the correct technology in the event \nthat the Link Partner does not support Auto-Negotiation, yet is transmitting link signals that the 10BASE-Te or \n100BASE-X PMA recognize as valid link signals.\nIf the DP83869HM completes Auto-Negotiation as a result of Parallel Detection without Next Page operation, bits \n5 and 7 of ANLPAR (register address 5h) are set to reflect the mode of operation present in the Link Partner. \nNote that bits 4:0 of the ANLPAR are also set to 00001 based on a successful parallel detection to indicate a \nvalid 802.3 selector field. Software may determine that the negotiation is completed through Parallel Detection \nby reading 0 in bit 0 of ANER (register address 6h) after Auto-Negotiation Complete—bit 5 of BMSR (register \naddress 1h)—is set. If the PHY is configured for parallel detect mode and any condition other than a good link \noccurs, the parallel detect fault—bit 4 of ANER (register address 6h)—sets.\n9.4.10.6 Restart Auto-Negotiation\nIf a link is established by successful Auto-Negotiation and then lost, the Auto-Negotiation process resumes \nto determine the configuration for the link. This function ensures that a link can be re-established if the \ncable becomes disconnected and reconnected. After Auto-Negotiation is completed, it may be restarted at \nany time by writing 1 to bit 9 of the BMCR (register address 0h). A restart Auto-Negotiation request from \nany entity, such as a management agent, causes DP83869HM to halt data transmission or link pulse activity \nuntil the break_link_timer expires. Consequently, the Link Partner goes into link fail mode and the resume Auto-\nNegotiation. The DP83869HM resumes Auto-Negotiation after the break_link_timer has expired by transmitting \nFLP (Fast Link Pulse) bursts.\n9.4.10.7 Enabling Auto-Negotiation Through Software\nIf Auto-Negotiation is disabled by MDIO access, and the user desires to restart Auto-Negotiation, this could be \naccomplished by software access. Bit 12 of BMCR (register address 0h) should be cleared and then set for \nAuto-Negotiation operation to take place.\nIf Auto-Negotiation is disabled by strap option, Auto-Negotiation cannot be re-enabled.\n9.4.10.8 Auto-Negotiation Complete Time\nParallel detection and Auto-Negotiation typically take 2-3 seconds to complete. In addition, Auto-Negotiation with \nnext page exchange takes approximately 2-3 seconds to complete, depending on the number of next pages \nexchanged. Refer to Clause 28 of the IEEE 802.3 standard for a full description of the individual timers related to \nAuto-Negotiation.\n9.4.10.9 Auto-MDIX Resolution\nThe DP83869HM can determine if a straight  or crossover  cable is used to connect to the link partner. It \ncan automatically re-assign channel A and B to establish link with the link partner, (and channel C and \nD in 1000BASE-T mode). Auto-MDIX resolution precedes the actual Auto-Negotiation process that involves \nexchange of FLPs to advertise capabilities. Automatic MDI/MDIX is described in IEEE 802.3 Clause 40, section \n40.8.2. It is not a required implementation for 10BASE-Te and 100BASE-TX.\nAuto-MDIX can be enabled or disabled by strap, using the AMDIX Disable strap, or by register configuration, \nusing bit 6 of the PHYCR register (address 10h). When Auto-MDIX is disabled, the PMA is forced to either MDI \n(straight ) or MDIX ( crossed ). Manual configuration of MDI or MDIX can also be accomplished by strap, using the \nForce MDI/X strap, or by register configuration, using bit 5 of the PHYCR register.DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n44 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nFor 10/100, Auto-MDIX is independent of Auto-Negotiation. Auto-MDIX works in both Auto-Negotiation mode \nand manual forced speed mode.\n9.5 Programming\n9.5.1 Strap Configuration\nThe DP83869HM uses many of the functional pins as strap options to place the device into specific modes \nof operation. The values of these pins are sampled at power up or hard reset. During software resets, the \nstrap options are internally reloaded from the values sampled at power up or hard reset. The strap option pin \nassignments are defined below.\nConfiguration of the device may be done through the strap pins or through the management register interface. A \npullup resistor and/or a pulldown resistor of suggested values may be used to set the voltage ratio of the strap \npin input and the supply to select one of the possible selected modes.\nThe MAC interface pins must support I/O voltages of 3.3 V, 2.5 V, and 1.8 V. As the strap inputs are implemented \non these pins, the straps must also support operation at 3.3-V, 2.5-V, and 1.8-V supplies depending on what \nvoltage was selected for I/O. RX_D0 and RX_D1 pins are 4 level strap pins. All other strap pins have two levels.\nRhi\nRlo9k\r\x03\n±25%VDDIO\nV STRAP\nDP83869\nFigure 9-15.

Based on the strapped \nOPMODE[2:0] the default funciton of each LED might change. Please see "LED Default Configuration Based \non Device Mode" for more information. LED operation mode can be selected using the LEDS_CFG1 register \n(address 18h).\nBecause the LED output pins are also used as straps, the external components required for strapping and \nLED usage must be considered to avoid contention. Specifically, when the LED outputs are used to drive LEDs \ndirectly, the active state of each output driver is dependent on the logic level sampled by the corresponding AN \ninput upon power up or reset.DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n48 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nIf a given strap input is resistively pulled low then the corresponding output is configured as an active high driver. \nConversely, if a given strap input is resistively pulled high, then the corresponding output is configured as an \nactive low driver.\nRefer to Figure 9-16  for an example of strap connections to external components. In this example, the strapping \nresults in Mode 0 for LED_0 and Mode 1 for LED_1.\nThe adaptive nature of the LED outputs helps to simplify potential implementation issues of these dual purpose \npins.\nVDD\n2.49 k\x01  \n470\x00  470\x02  \nGND\nLED_0 LED_1\nMode 1 Mode 0\nFigure 9-16. Example Strap Connections\nThe following conditions must be accounted when using LEDs:\n•In RGMII-to-SGMII bridge mode with force speeds, Link LED function cannot be used.\n•In both Bridge modes, LEDs can be configured to indicate TX only or RX only activity. LED will indicate \nactivity with respect to RGMII when the PHY is in Bridge mode.\n•In 1000-Mbps media convertor mode, the link LED corresponds to 1000M link on Copper interface. If link \nspeed is changed then Link LED cannot be used.\n•In 100-Mbps media convertor mode, the link LED corresponds to 100M link on Copper interface. If link speed \nis changed then Link LED cannot be used.\n9.5.3 Reset Operation\nThe DP83869HM needs external control over RESET_N pin during power up. If RESET_N pin is connected to \nhost controller, then the PHY should be held in reset for a minimum of 200 ms after the last supply powers up \nas shown in . If host controller cannot be Figure 8-1  connected to RESET_N then a 100- Ω resistor and 47-µF \ncapacitor are required to be connected in series between RESET_N pin and ground as shown in Figure 9-17 . \nDuring normal operation, the device can be reset by a hardware or software reset.\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 49\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nRESET_N\nDP8386947 \x85F     100 \rFigure 9-17. RESET_N Circuit\n9.5.3.1 Hardware Reset\nA hardware reset is accomplished by applying a low pulse, with a duration of at least 1 μs, to the RESET_N pin. \nThis resets the device such that all registers are reinitialized to default values and the hardware configuration \nvalues are re-latched into the device (similar to the power up or reset operation).\n9.5.3.2 IEEE Software Reset\nAn IEEE registers software reset is accomplished by setting the reset bit (bit 15) of the BMCR register (address \n0h). This bit resets the IEEE-defined standard registers.\n9.5.3.3 Global Software Reset\nA global software reset is accomplished by setting bit 15 of register CTRL (address 1Fh) to 1. This bit resets \nall the internal circuits in the PHY including IEEE-defined registers and all the extended registers. The global \nsoftware resets the device such that all registers are reset to default values and the hardware configuration \nvalues are maintained.\n9.5.3.4 Global Software Restart\nA global software restart is accomplished by setting bit 14 of register CTRL (1Fh) to 1. This action resets all the \nPHY circuits except the registers in the Register File.DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n50 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n9.6 Register Maps\nFor Fiber Operations (RGMII-to-1000Base-X and RGMII-to-100Base-FX), Fiber register location 0Cxxh get \nmapped to 0xxxxh address location to comply with IEEE Specifications.\n9.6.1 DP83869 Registers\nDP83869 Registers  lists the memory-mapped registers for the DP83869 registers.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n10.1 Application Information\nThe DP83869HM is a 10/100/1000 Copper and Fiber Ethernet PHY. It supports connections to an Ethernet \nMAC through SGMII or RGMII. MII is also supported but only for 100M and 10M speeds. For MII to be operate \ncorrectly, 1000M advertisement should be disabled. SGMII is not available in Fiber Ethernet mode and Media \nConvertor mode because the SGMII pins are multipurpose pins which carry Fiber Ethernet signals. Connections \nto the Ethernet media are made through the IEEE 802.3 defined Media Dependent Interface.\nWhen using the device for Ethernet application, it is necessary to meet certain requirements for normal operation \nof the device. The following typical application and design requirements can be used for selecting appropriate \ncomponent values for the DP83869.\n10.2 Typical Applications\n10.2.1 Copper Ethernet Typical Application\nDP83869\n10/100/1000 Mbps\nEthernet Physical LayerEthernet MAC MagneticsCable \nConnector\nStatus\nLEDs25 MHz\nCrystal or OscillatorRGMII\nSGMII\nMII10BASE-Te\n100BASE-TX\n1000BASE-T\nFigure 10-1.

Check with the vendor for the recommended loads.\nXI XO\nR1\nCL2 CL1\nFigure 10-2. Crystal Oscillator Circuit\nAs a starting point for evaluating the oscillator performance, the value of CL1 and CL2 should each be equal \nto 2x the specified load capacitance from the crystal vendor’s data sheet. For example, if the specified load \ncapacitance of the crystal is 10 pF, set CL1 = CL2 = 20 pF. CL1, CL2 value may need to be adjusted based on \nthe parasitic capacitance. Depending on the crystal drive level, R1 may or may not be needed.\nSpecification for 25-MHz crystal are listed in Table 10-1 .\nTable 10-1. 25-MHz Crystal Specifications\nPARAMETER TEST CONDITION MIN TYP MAX UNIT\nFrequency 25 MHz\nFrequency \nToleranceIncluding Operational Temperature, Aging, and \nOther Factors±100 ppm\nLoad Capacitance 15 40 pF\nESR 50 ohm\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 91\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n10.2.1.2.1.2 External Clock Source Recommendation\nIf an external clock oscillator is used, then it should be directly connected to XI.

The I/O power supply can also be \noperated independently of the main device power supplies to provide flexibility for the MAC interface. There are \ntwo possible supply configuration that can be used: Two-supply and Three-supply. In Two-supply Configuration, \nno power rail is connected to VDDA1P8_x pins (pin 13, 48). When unused, pin 13 and 48 should be left floating \nwith no components attached to them.\n11.1 Two-Supply Configuration\nFigure 11-1  shows the connection diagram for a two-supply configuration.\nFigure 11-1. Two-Supply Configuration\nFor a two-supply configuration, both VDDA1P8 pins must be left unconnected.\nPlace 1- μF and 0.1- μF decoupling capacitors as close as possible to component VDD pins, placing the 0.1- μF \ncapacitor closest to the pin.\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 95\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\nThe strap (SUPPLYMODE_SEL, pin 23) shall be pulled low to set double supply mode.

Traces must be kept short as possible. \nUnless mentioned otherwise, all signal traces should be 50- Ω, single-ended impedance. Differential traces \nshould be 50- Ω, single-ended and 100- Ω differential. Take care that the impedance is constant throughout. \nImpedance discontinuities cause reflections leading to EMI and signal integrity problems. Stubs must be avoided \non all signal traces, especially the differential signal pairs. See Figure 12-1 .\nWithin the differential pairs, the trace lengths must run parallel to each other and matched in length. Matched \nlengths minimize delay differences, avoiding an increase in common-mode noise and increased EMI.\nLength matching is also important on MAC interface. All Transmit signal trace lengths must match to each \nother and all Receive signal trace lengths must match to each other. When using 1G transmission speeds, the \ntolerance for length matching is 50 mils. When using 100/10M, the tolerance for length matching is 100 mils.\nIdeally, there should be no crossover or via on the signal paths. Vias present impedance discontinuities and \nshould be minimized. Route an entire trace pair on a single layer if possible.\nFigure 12-1. Avoiding Stubs in a Differential Signal Pair\nSignals on different layers should not cross each other without at least one return path plane between them.\nCoupling between traces is also an important factor. Unwanted coupling can cause cross talk problems. \nDifferential pairs on the other hand, should have a constant coupling distance between them.\nFor convenience and efficient layout process, start by routing the critical signals first.\n12.1.1.1 MAC Interface Layout Guidelines\nThe Media Independent Interface (SGMII / RGMII) connects the DP83869 to the Media Access Controller \n(MAC). The MAC may in fact be a discrete device, integrated into a microprocessor, CPU, or FPGA.\n12.1.1.1.1 SGMII Layout Guidelines\n•All SGMII connections must be AC-coupled through an 0.1-µF capacitor. Series capacitors must be 0.1 µF \nand the size should be 0402 or smaller.\n•SGMII signals are differential signals.\n•Traces must be routed with 100-Ω differential impedance.\n•Skew matching within a pair must be less than 5 pS, which correlates to 30 mil for standard FR4.\n•There is no requirement to match the TX pair to the RX pair.\n•SGMII signals must be routed on the same layer.\n•Pairs must be referenced to parallel ground plane.\nwww.ti.comDP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 99\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n•When operating in 6-wire mode, the RX pair must match the Clock pair to within 5 pS, which correlates to 30 \nmil for standard FR4.\n12.1.1.1.2 RGMII Layout Guidelines\n•RGMII signals are single-ended signals.\n•Traces must be routed with impedance of 50 Ω to ground.\n•Skew between TXD[3:0] lines should be less than 11 ps, which correlates to 60 mil for standard FR4.\n•Skew between RXD[3:0] lines should be less than 11 ps, which correlates to 60 mil for standard FR4.\n•Keep trace lengths as short as possible, Traces less than 2 inches is recommended with less than 6 inches \nas maximum length.\n•Configurable clock skew for GTX_CLK and RX_CLK.\n–Clock skew for RX and TX paths can be optimized independently.\n–Clock skew is adjustable in 0.25-ns increments (through register).\n12.1.1.2 MDI Layout Guidelines\nThe Media Dependent Interface (MDI) connects the DP83869 to the transformer and the Ethernet network.\n•MDI traces must be 50 Ω to ground and 100-Ω differential controlled impedance.\n•Route MDI traces to transformer on the same layer.\n•Use a metal shielded RJ-45 connector, and connect the shield to chassis ground.\n•Use magnetics with integrated common-mode choking devices.\n•Void supplies and ground beneath magnetics.\n•Do not overlap the circuit and chassis ground planes, keep them isolated. Instead, make chassis ground \nan isolated island and make a void between the chassis and circuit ground. Connecting circuit and chassis \nplanes using a size 1206 resistor and capacitor on either side of the connector is a good practice.\n12.1.2 Return Path\nA general best practice is to have a solid return path beneath all signal traces. This return path can be a \ncontinuous ground or DC power plane. Reducing the width of the return path width can potentially affect the \nimpedance of the signal trace. This effect is more prominent when the width of the return path is comparable \nto the width of the signal trace. Breaks in return path beneath the signal traces should be avoided at all cost. A \nsignal crossing a plane split may cause unpredictable return path currents and would likely impact signal quality \nas well, potentially creating EMI problems. See Figure 12-2 .\nFigure 12-2. Differential Signal Pair-Plane Crossing\n12.1.3 Transformer Layout\nThere should be no metal layer running beneath the transformer. Transformers can inject noise in metal beneath \nthem which can affect the performance of the system.\n12.1.4 Metal Pour\nAll metal pours which are not signals or power should be tied to ground. There should be no floating metal on the \nsystem. There should be no metal between the differential traces.DP83869HM\nSNLS614B – SEPTEMBER 2018 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n100 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DP83869HM\n12.1.5 PCB Layer Stacking\nTo meet signal integrity and performance requirements, at minimum a 4-layer PCB should be used. However a \n6-layer board is recommended. See Figure 12-3  for the recommended layer stack ups for 4, 6, and 8-layer \nboards. These are recommendations not requirements, other configurations can be used as per system \nrequirements.\nFigure 12-3. Recommended Layer Stack-Up\nWithin a PCB, it may be desirable to run traces using different methods, microstrip vs. stripline, depending on the \nlocation of the signal on the PCB. For example, it may be desirable to change layer stacking where an isolated \nchassis ground plane is used. Figure 12-4  shows alternative PCB stacking options.\nFigure 12-4.
