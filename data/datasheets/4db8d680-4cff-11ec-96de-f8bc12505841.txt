USE PRECAUTIONS \n 11.1 Handling precautions \n1) The polarizing plate may break easily so be careful when handling it. Do not touch, \npress or rub it with a hard-material tool like tweezers. \n2) Do not touch the polarizing plate surface with bare hands so as not to make it dirty. If \nthe surface or other related part of the polarizing plate is dirty, soak a soft cotton cloth \nor chamois leather in benzene and wipe off with it. Do not use chemical liquids such \nas acetone, toluene and isopropyl alcohol. Failure to do so may bring chemical \nreaction phenomena and deteriorations. \n3) Remove any spit or water immediately. If it is left for hours, the suffered part may \ndeform or decolorize. \n4) If the LCD element breaks and any LC stuff leaks, do not suck or lick it. Also if LC \nstuff is stuck on your skin or clothing, wash thoroughly with soap and water \nimmediately. \n 11.2 Installing precautions \n1) The PCB has many ICs that may be damaged easily by static electricity. To prevent \nbreaking by static electricity from the human body and clothing, earth the human \nbody properly using the high resistance and discharge static electricity during the \noperation. In this case, however, the resistance value should be approx. 1MΩ and the \nresistance should be placed near the human body rather than the ground surface. \nWhen the indoor space is dry, static electricity may occur easily so be careful. We \nrecommend the indoor space should be kept with humidity of 60% or more. When a \nsoldering iron or other similar tool is used for assembly, be sure to earth it. \n2) When installing the module and ICs, do not bend or twist them. Failure to do so may \ncrack LC element and cause circuit failure. \n3) To protect LC element, especially polarizing plate, use a transparent protective plate \n(e.g., acrylic plate, glass etc) for the product case. \n4) Do not use an adhesive like a both-side adhesive tape to make LCD surface \n(polarizing plate) and product case stick together. Failure to do so may cause the \npolarizing plate to peel off. \n \nDate : 2015/07/16        AMPIRE CO., LTD.                    20  \n  11.3  Storage precautions \n1) Avoid a high temperature and humidity area. Keep the temperature between 0°C and \n35°C and also the humidity under 60%. \n2) Choose the dark spaces where the product is not exposed to direct sunlight or \nfluorescent light. \n3) Store the products as they are put in the boxes provided from us or in the same \nconditions as we recommend. \n  11.4  Operating precautions \n1) Do not boost the applied drive voltage abnormally. Failure to do so may break ICs. \nWhen applying power voltage, check the electrical features beforehand and be \ncareful. Always turn off the power to the LC module controller before removing or \ninserting the LC module input connector. If the input connector is removed or inserted \nwhile the power is turned on, the LC module internal circuit may break. \n2) The display response may be late if the operating temperature is under the normal \nstandard, and the display may be out of order if it is above the normal standard. But \nthis is not a failure; this will be restored if it is within the normal standard. \n3) The LCD contrast varies depending on the visual angle, ambient temperature, power \nvoltage etc. Obtain the optimum contrast by adjusting the LC dive voltage. \n4) When carrying out the test, do not take the module out of the low-temperature space \nsuddenly. Failure to do so will cause the module condensing, leading to malfunctions. \n5) Make certain that each signal noise level is within the standard (L level: 0.2VCC or \nless and H level: 0.8VCC or more) even if the module has functioned properly. If it is \nbeyond the standard, the module may often malfunction. In addition, always connect \nthe module when making noise level measurements. \n6) The CMOS ICs are incorporated in the module and the pull-up and pull-down function \nis not adopted for the input so avoid putting the input signal open while the power is \nON. \n7) The characteristic of the semiconductor element changes when it is exposed to light \nemissions, therefore ICs on the LCD may malfunction if they receive light emissions. \nTo prevent these malfunctions, design and assemble ICs so that they are shielded \nfrom light emissions. \n8) Crosstalk occurs because of characteristics of the LCD. In general, crosstalk occurs \nwhen the regularized display is maintained. Also, crosstalk is affected by the LC drive \nvoltage. Design the contents of the display, considering crosstalk. \n \n \n \n \nDate : 2015/07/16        AMPIRE CO., LTD.                    21   11.5  Other \n1) Do not disassemble or take the LC module into pieces. The LC modules once \ndisassembled or taken into pieces are not the guarantee articles. \n2) The residual image may exist if the same display pattern is shown for hours. This \nresidual image, however, disappears when another display pattern is shown or the \ndrive is interrupted and left for a while. But this is not a problem on reliability. \n3) AMIPRE will provide one year warranty for all products and three months warrantee \nfor all repairing products. \n \n \nDate : 2015/07/16        AMPIRE CO., LTD.                    22 12.
