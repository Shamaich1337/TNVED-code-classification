When a single-ended clock signal is connected, use the P \nside of the differential signal. As clock inputs, these pins are used to drive the clock line. When these pins do \nnot need to drive the clock line, they can also be used as general purpose I/O. \n➢ Global clock network \nGlob al clock network supports 8 global clocks and 8 glob al signals 8 global signals can also be used as \nglob al clocks. \nThe global clock can clock vario us resources within the device, such as CLM DRM and IO Logic.  The \nglob al clock supports a clock frequency of 400MHz. The global clock supports clock dynamic enable and \ndynamic sw itching functions. \nGlob al signals are used as glob al contr ol signals, such as clock enable signals, synchronous and \nasynch ronous clear, reset or outpu t enable signals. \n➢ I/O clock network \nThere are 4 I/O clock networks, 2 each near BANK0 and BANK2. The clock signal can reach the IO \nLogic t hrough the I/O clo ck as the high-speed sampling clock of the signal. \nThe I/O clock has the characteristics of high frequency (600 MHz) and small  frequency offse t. The I/O \nclock supports the dynamic e nable function. \n➢ PLL  \nThe Compact family CPLD devices have up to 2 PLLs. P LL is the core subsystem that CPLD provid es \nclock resources.  \nThe main functions are clock frequency synthesis,  reducing clock skew, adjusting clock phase and low \npower managem ent. \nThe input clock of the PLL supports input clock from external I/O and internal interconnect. Two input \nclocks are supported for dynamic switching. The PLL\'s feedback clock supports input from external I/O and \ninternal interconne ct. \nPLL supports multiple clock outpu ts, each clock outpu t has an independent frequency divider, \nsupports 1-128 frequency division; each clock output can be cascaded, and PLLs can also be cascaded; each \nCompact Series CPLD Device Data Sheet  \nDS03001（V1.5） www.pangomicro.com Page 11 of 31   \n clock output has optional dynamic Clock enable control; PLL also supports 16-bit precision  fractional clock \noutput, allowing users to generate non-integer outp ut clocks. For details of the fractional frequency division \ncalculation method and usage restrictions, please refer to "UG03000 3_ Compact Series CPLD Clock \nResou rces Clock&PLL User Guide". \nThe PLL supports both static configu ration and dynamic control of the clock phase. Amo ng them, \nwhen dynamically  adjusting the phase of the PLL, it can be rewritten with the APB interface, or controlled \nthrough the port. The PLL can dynamically  and continuously realize the gradual increase or decrea se of the \nphase, and during the phase adjustment process, the adjusted clock output has no glitches. \nThe PLL supports standby mode (standby mode, that is, when the PLL is not needed in the design, \nthe PLL can be powered down  to save  power consumption. \nThe PLL supports the user to dynamically  change the PLL operat ing param eters through the APB \ninterface, providing another way for the user to dynamically  configure the PLL. Details can be found in the \nUG030003 Compact Series CPLD Clock Reso urces Clock&PLL User Guide. \n2.4 I/O unit \n2.4.1 IO B uffer ( IOB ) \nIO Buffer has different numbers of I/ O Ban ks according to different device sizes (see Table 2-4 for \ndetails).
