B | Page 17 of 32 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD9649 architecture consists of a multistage, pipelined ADC. \nEach stage provides sufficient overlap to correct for flash errors in \nthe preceding stage. The quantized outputs from each stage are combined into a final 14-bit result in the digital correction logic. The pipelined architecture permits the first stage to operate with a new input sample, whereas the remaining stages operate with pre-ceding samples. Sampling occurs on the rising edge of the clock. \nEach stage of the pipeline, excluding the last, consists of a low \nresolution flash ADC connected to a switched-capacitor DAC \nand an interstage residue amplifier (for example, a multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC)). The residue amplifier magnifies the difference between the reconstructed DAC output and the flash input for the next stage in the pipeline. One bit of \nredundancy is used in each stage to facilitate digital correction \nof flash errors. The last stage consists of a flash ADC. \nThe output staging block aligns the data, corrects errors, and \npasses the data to the CMOS output buffers. The output buffers are powered from a separate (DRVDD) supply, allowing adjust-ment of the output voltage swing. During power-down, the output \nbuffers go into a high impedance state. \nANALOG INPUT CONSIDERATIONS \nThe analog input to the AD9649 is a differential switched-\ncapacitor circuit designed for processing differential input \nsignals. This circuit can support a wide common-mode range \nwhile maintaining excellent performance. By using an input common-mode voltage of midsupply, users can minimize \nsignal-dependent errors and achieve optimum performance. \nSS\nHCPARCSAMPLE\nCSAMPLECPAR\nVIN–\nHSSHVIN+H\n08539-006 \nFigure 35. Switched-Cap acitor Input Circuit \nThe clock signal alternately switches the input circuit between \nsample mode and hold mode (see Figure 35). When the input \ncircuit is switched to sample mode, the signal source must be \ncapable of charging the sample capacitors and settling within one-half of a clock cycle. A small resistor in series with each input can help reduce the peak transient current injected from the output stage of the driving source. In addition, low Q inductors or ferrite \nbeads can be placed on each leg of the input to reduce high differ-\nential capacitance at the analog inputs and, therefore, achieve the maximum bandwidth of the ADC. Such use of low Q inductors or ferrite beads is required when driving the converter front end at high IF frequencies. Either a shunt capacitor or two single-ended capacitors can be placed on the inputs to provide a matching pas-sive network. This ultimately creates a low-pass filter at the input to limit unwanted broadband noise. See the AN-742 Application \nNote , the AN-827 Application Note , and the Analog Dialogue  \narticle, “ Transformer-Coupled Front-End for Wideband A/D \nConverters ” (Volume 39, April 2005) for more information. In \ngeneral, the precise values depend on the application. \nInput Common Mode  \nThe analog inputs of the AD9649  are not internally dc-biased. \nTherefore, in ac-coupled applications, the user must provide an external dc bias. Setting the device so that VCM = AVDD/2 is recommended for optimum performance, but the device can \nfunction over a wider range with reasonable performance, as \nshown in Figure 36 and Figure 37.  \n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3\nINPUT COMMON-MODE VOLTAGE (V)SNR/SFDR (dBFS/dBc)SFDR (dBc)\nSNR (dBFS)\n08539-049 \nFigure 36.

For baseband applications, \nthe AD8138, ADA4937- 2, and ADA4938- 2 differential drivers  \nprovide excellent performance and a  flexible interface to the ADC.  \nThe output co mmon -mode voltage of the  ADA4938- 2 is easily \nset with the VCM pin of the AD9649 (see Figure 38), and the \ndriver can be configured in a Sallen -Key filter topology to \nprovide band limit ing of the input signal.  \nAVDD VIN 76.8Ω\n120Ω0.1µF33Ω\n33Ω10pF\n200Ω200Ω\n90Ω\nADA4938-2 ADCVIN–\nVIN+ VCM\n08539-007 \nFigure 38.

Different ial Transformer- Coupled Configuration  \nThe signal characteristics must be considered when selecting a  \ntransformer . Most RF transformers saturate at frequencies b elow a \nfew megahertz (MHz). Excessive signal power can also cause core \nsaturation, which leads to distortion.  \nAt input frequencies in the second Nyquist zone and above, the noise performance of most amplifiers is not adequate to achieve the true SNR performance of the AD9649. For applicati ons above  \n~10 MHz where  SNR is a key parameter, differential double balun \ncoupling is the recommended input config uration (see Figure 41). \nAn alternative to using a transformer -coupled input at frequencies \nin the second Nyquist zone is to use the AD8352 differe ntial driver. \nAn example is shown in Figure 42. See the AD8352 data sheet \nfor m ore information.  \nIn any configuration, the value of Shunt Capacitor C is dependent on the input frequency and source impedance and may need to be reduced or removed. Table 9 displays the suggested  values to set \nthe RC network. Ho wever, these values are dependent on the \ninput signal and should be used only as a star ting guide. \nTable 9.

The degradation in SNR from the low \nfrequency SNR (SNR LF) at a given input frequency ( fINPUT ) due \nto jitter (t JRMS) can be calc ulated by  \nSNR HF = −10 log[(2π × fINPUT × tJRMS)2 + 10)10/ (LF SNR−] \nIn the previous equation, the rms aperture jitter represents the \nclock input jitter specification.

SNR vs. Input Frequency and Jitter  \nThe clock input should be treated as an analog signal in cases in  \nwhich aperture jitter may affect the dynamic range of the AD9649 . \nTo avoid modulating the clock signal with digital noise, keep power  supplies for clock drivers separate from the ADC output driver \nsupplies . Low jitter, crystal -controlled oscillators make the best \nclock sources. If the clock is generated from another  type of source \n(by gating, dividing, or another met hod), it should  be retimed by \nthe original clock at the last step. \nFor more information, s ee the AN-501 Application Note  and the \nAN-756 Application Note . \nPOWER DISSIPATION AND STANDBY MODE  \nAs shown in Figure 54, the analog core power dissipated by the \nAD9649 is prop ortional to its sample rate. T he digital power \ndissipation of the CMOS outputs are determined primarily by the  \nstrength of the digital drivers a nd the load on each output bit.  \nThe maximum D RVDD current (I DRVDD ) can be calculated a s \nIDRVDD  = VDRVDD  × CLOAD × fCLK × N \nwhere N is the number of output bits (15, in the case of the \nAD9649).  \nThis maximum current occurs when every output b it switches \non every clock cycle, that is, a full -scale square wave at the Nyquist \nfrequency of f CLK/2. In practice, the DRVDD current is established  \nby the average number of output bits  that are  switching, which \nis determined by the sample rate and the ch aracte ristics of the \nanalog input signal.  \nReducing the capacitive load presented to the output drivers can \nminimize digital power co nsumption. The data in Figure 54 was \ntaken using the same operating conditions as those used for t he \nTypical Performance Characteristics , with a 5 pF load on each \noutput driver.  \n85\n75\n65\n5580\n70\n60\n50\n45\n3540\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\nCLOCK RATE (MSPS)ANALOG CORE POWER (mW)AD9649-80\nAD9649-65\nAD9649-40\nAD9649-20\n08539-051 \nFigure 54. Analog Core Power vs. Clock  Rate   \nIn SPI mode , the AD9649 can be placed in power -down mode \ndirectly via the SPI port or by using the programmable external \nMODE pin. In non -SPI mode , power -down is achieved by assert -\ning the PDWN pin high . In this state, the ADC typically dissipates \n500 µ W . During power -down, the output drivers are placed in a \nhigh impedance state. Asserting the PDWN  pin (or the MODE  pin \nin SPI mode) low returns the AD9649 to normal operating mode.  \nNote that PDWN is re ferenced to the digital output driver  supply \n(DRVDD) and should not exceed that supply voltage.  \nAD9649  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 22 of 32 Low power dissipation in power -down mode is achieved by shut -\nting down the reference, reference buffer, biasing networks, and \nclock. Internal capacitors are discharged when  entering power -\ndown  mode and then must be recharged when r eturning to normal \noperation. As a result, wake -up time is related to the time spent \nin power -down mode, and shorter power -down cycles result in \nproportio nally shorter wake -up times.  \nWhen using the  SPI port interface, the user can place the ADC  \nin power -down mode or standby mode. Standby mode allows \nthe user to keep the internal reference circuitry powered when faster wake -up times are required. See the Memory Map  section  \nfor more details.  \nDIGITAL OUTPUTS  \nThe AD9649 output drivers can be configured to interface with \n1.8 V to 3.3 V CMOS logic families. Output data can also be multi -\nplexed onto a single output bus  to reduce the total number of traces  \nrequired.  \nThe CMOS output drivers are sized to provide suff icient output \ncurrent to drive a wide variety of logic families. However, large drive  currents tend to cause current glitches on the supplies and  \nmay affect co nverter performance.  \nApplications requiring the ADC to drive large capacitive loads or large fanouts may require external buffers or latche s. \nThe output data format can be selected to be either offset binary or twos complement by setting the SCLK/DFS pin w hen opera ting \nin the external pin mode (see Table 11). \nAs detailed in  the AN-877 Application Note , Interfacing to High \nSpeed ADCs via SPI , the  data forma t can be selected for offset \nbinary, twos complement, or gray code when using the SPI con trol. \nTable 11.

The OEB  function  of the MODE pin is enabled via  \nBits[6:5]  of Register 0x 08. \nIf the MODE pin is configured to operate in traditional OEB mode  \nand the MODE pin is low, the output data drivers and DCOs are \nenabled.  If the MODE  pin is high, the ou tput data drivers and  \nDCOs are pla ced in a high impedance state. This OEB  function \nis not intended for rapid access to the data bus. Note that the \nMODE pin  is referenced to the digital output driver supply \n(DRVDD) and should not exceed that supply voltage.  \nTIMING  \nThe AD9649 provides latched data with a pipeline d elay of eight  \nclock cycles. Data outputs are available one propagation d elay (t PD) \nafter the rising edge of the clock signal. \nMinimize t he length of the output data lines and loads placed on  \nthem  to reduce transients within the AD9649. These transients \nmay degrade converter dynamic perfor mance.  \nThe lowest typical conversion rate of the AD9649 is 3 MSPS. At \nclock rates below 3  MSPS, dynamic performance may degrade.  \nData Clock Output (DCO)  \nThe AD9649 provides a data clock output (DCO) signal that is \nintended  for capturing the data in an external regi ster. T he CMOS \ndata outputs are valid on the rising edge of DCO, unless the DCO \nclock polarity has been changed via the SPI.  See Figure 2 for a \ngraphical timing d escription.  \n \nTable 12.

B | Page 23 of 32 BUILT -IN SELF- TEST (BIST) AND OUTP UT TEST  \nThe AD9649 includes a built -in test feature designed to enable \nverification of the integrity of each channel , as well as facilitate \nboard -level debugging. A lso included is a  built -in sel f-test (BIST ) \nfeature that veri fies the integrity of the digital datapath of the \nAD9649. Various output test options are also provided to place \npredictable values on the outputs of the AD9649.  \nBUILT -IN SELF- TEST (BIST)  \nThe BIST is a thorough test of the digital portion of the selected AD9649 signal path. Perform t he BIST test a fter a reset to ensure \nthat the part is in a known state.  During the BIST  test, data from  \nan internal pseudorandom noise (PN) source is driven through the digital datapath of both channels , start ing at the ADC block \noutput. At  the datapath output, CRC logi c calculates a signature \nfrom the data. The BIST sequence runs for 512 cycles and then \nstops. When the BIST sequence is complete, the BIST compares \nthe signature results with  a pre determined value.  If the signatures  \nmatch, the BIST sets Bit 0 of Register 0 x24, signifying that the \ntest passed. If the BIST test failed, Bit  0 of Register 0x24 is cleared.  \nThe outputs are  conne cted during this test  so that the PN sequence  \ncan be observed as it runs. Writing the value 0x05 to Register 0x0E  runs the BIST, enablin g Bit 0 (BIST enable) of Register 0x0E  \nand resetting  the PN sequence generator , Bit 2 (BIST init ) of \nRegister  0x0E.  Upon completion of the BIST, Bit  0 of Register 0x24 \nis automatically cleared. The PN sequence can be continued fr om \nits last value by writin g a 0 in Bit 2 of Register 0x0E. However,  if the \nPN sequence is not reset, the signature cal culation does  not equal  \nthe pre determined value at  the end of the test.  The user must \nthen  rely on verifying the output data . \nOUTPUT TEST MODES  \nThe output test opti ons are described  in Table 16 at Address 0x0D.  \nWhen an output test mode is enabled, the anal og section of the \nADC is discon nected from the digital back  end blocks and the \ntest pattern is run through the output formatting block. Some of \nthe test patterns are subject to output formatting, and some are not. The PN generators from the PN sequence tests can be reset \nby setting Bit 4 or Bit 5 of Register 0x0D. These tests can be per -\nformed with or without  an analog signal (if present, the analog \nsignal is ignored), but they do require an encode clock.

B | Page 24 of 32 SERIAL PORT INTERFACE ( SPI) \nThe AD9649 SPI allows the user to co nfigure the converter for \nspecific functions or operations through a structured register space  \nprovided inside the ADC . The SPI gives the user added flexibilit y \nand customization, depending on the application. Addresses are \naccessed via the serial port and can be written to or read from via  \nthe port. Memory is organized into bytes that can be further divided into fields, which are docu mented in the Memory Map  \nsection . For detailed oper ational  information, see the AN-877 \nApplication Note , Interfacing to High Speed ADC s via SPI . \nCONFIGURATION USING THE SPI  \nThree  pins define the S PI of this ADC: the SCLK (SCLK/DFS , \nthe SDIO (SDIO/PDWN) , and the CSB (see Table 13). The SCLK  \n(a serial clock) is used to sy nchronize the read and write data \npresented from and to the ADC.  The SDIO (serial dat a input/  \noutput) is a dual -purpose pin that allows data to be sent and \nread from the internal ADC memory map regi sters. The CSB  \n(chip select bar) is an active -low control that enables or di sables \nthe read and write cycles.  \nTable 13. Serial Port Interface Pins  \nPin Function  \nSCLK  Serial c lock. The serial shift clock input, which is used to \nsynchronize serial interface reads and writes.  \nSDIO  Serial data input/output. A dual -purpose pin that \ntypically serves as an input or an output, d epending on \nthe instruction being sent and the relative position in the \ntiming frame.  \nCSB  Chip select bar. An active -low control that gates the read \nand write cycles.  \n The falling edge of CSB , in conjunction with the rising edge of \nSCLK, determines th e start of the framing. An example of the \nserial timing and its definitions can be found in Figure 55 and \nTable 5.  \nOther modes involving the CSB are available. The CSB  can be \nheld low indefinitely, which permanently enables the device; \nthis is called streaming. The CSB can stall high between bytes to \nallow for additional external timing. When CSB is tied high, SPI \nfunctions are placed in high impedance mode. This mode turns \non any SPI pin secondary functi ons.  \nDuring an instruction phase, a 16 -bit instruction is transmitted. \nData follows the instruction phase, and its length is determined by the W0 and W1 bits , as shown in  Figure 55. \nAll data is composed of 8 -bit words.  The first bit of the first byte in \na multibyte serial data transfer frame indicates whether a read com -\nmand or a write command is issued. This allows the serial data \ninput/output (SDIO ) pin to change direction from an input to \nan output  at the appropriate point in the serial frame . \nIn addition to word length, the instruction phase determines \nwhether  the serial frame is a read or write operation, allowing \nthe serial port to be used both to program the chip and to read the contents of the on -chip memory. If the instruc tion is a readback  \noperation, performing a readbac k causes the serial data input/ \noutput  (SDIO) pin to change direction from an input to an ou tput \nat the appropriate point in the serial frame.  \nData can be sent in MSB -first mode or in LSB -first mode. MSB \nfirst is the default on power -up and can be changed via the SPI \nport con figuration register.

The SCLK pin and the CSB  pin function as inputs  \nwhen using the SPI interface. The SDIO pin is bidirectional, \nfunctioning as an input during write phases and as  an output \nduring readback.  \nThe SPI interface is flexible enough to be controlled by eit her \nFPGAs or microcontrollers. For detailed information about one method for SPI configuration, refer to the  AN-812 Application \nNote , Microcontroller -Based Serial Port Interface (SPI) Boot Circuit .  \nThe SPI port should not be  active during periods when the full \ndynamic performance of the converter is required. Because the SCLK signal, the CSB  signal, and the S DIO signal are typically \nasynchronous to the ADC clock, noise from these signals can \ndegrade converter performance. If the on -board SPI bus is used for \nother devices, it may be necessary to provide buffers between this  \nbus and the AD9649 to pr event these signals from transi tioning  \nat the converter inputs during critical sampling periods.  \nThe SDIO/PDWN  and SCLK/DFS  pins serve a dual function when \nthe SPI interface is not being used. When the p ins a re strapped \nto DR VDD or ground during device power -on, they are associated  \nwith a specific function. The Digital Outputs  section describes \nthe strappable functions su pported on the AD9649. \nCONFIGURATION WITHOU T THE SPI  \nIn applications that do not interface to the SPI control registers, \nthe SDIO/PDWN  pin and  the SCLK/DFS pin  serve as standalone \nCMOS -compatible control pins. When the device is powered up, it \nis assumed that  the user intends to use the pins as static control lines for the power -down and output data format feature control.  \nIn this mode, connect the CSB chip select to DR VDD, which \ndisables  the serial port interface.  \nTable 14.

B | Page 26 of 32 MEMORY MAP  \nREADING THE MEMORY M AP REGISTER TABLE  \nEach row in the memory map register table  (see Table 16) contains  \neight bit locations. The memory map is roughly divided into four \nsections: the chip co nfiguration registers (Address 0x00 to \nAddress 0x02); the device transfer registers ( Address 0xFF); the \nprogram  registers, including setup, control, and test (Address 0x08 \nto Address 0x2 A); and the digital feature control register s \n(Address 0x101).  \nTable 16 documents the default hexadecimal value for each \nhexadecimal ad dress shown. The column with the heading Bit 7 \n(MSB ) is the start of the default hexadecimal value given. For \nexample, Address 0x2A , the OR/MODE s elect  register, has a hexa -\ndecimal  default value of 0x01 . This means that in Address 0x2A , \nBits[7:1] = 0, and Bit 0  = 1. This setting is the default OR/ MODE \nsetting . The d efault value result s in the programmable external \nMODE/ OR pin (Pin 23) functioning as an out -of-range digital \noutput . For more information on this function and others, see the \nAN-877 Application  Note , Interfacing to High Speed ADCs via SPI. \nThis document  details the functions controlled by Register 0x00 \nto Register 0xFF . The remaining register , Register 0x101,  is \ndocu mented in the Memory Map Register Descriptions  section  \nthat follows  Table 16. \nOPEN LOCATIONS  \nAll address and bit locations that are not included in the SPI map \nare not currently supported for this device. Unused bits of a valid  \naddress location should be written with 0s. Writing to t hese \nlocations is required only when part of an address location is  \nopen (for example, Address 0x2A ). If the entire address location \nis open , it is omitted from the SPI map (for e xample, Address 0x13 ) \nand should not be written.  DEFAULT VALUES  \nAfter the AD9649 is reset, critical registers are loaded with default  \nvalues. The default values for the regi sters are given in the memory  \nmap register table  (see Table 16). \nLogic Levels  \nAn explanation of logic level terminology follows:  \n• “Bit is set” is sy nonymous with “bit is set to Logic 1” or \n“writing Logic 1 for the bit. ”  \n• “Clear a bit” is synonymous with “bit is set to Logic 0” or \n“writing Logic 0 for the bit. ”  \nTransfer Register Map  \nAddress 0x08 to Address 0x18 are shadowed. Writes to these \naddresses do not affect part operation until a transfer command is issued by writing 0x01 to Address 0xFF, setting the transfer bit. \nThis allows these registers to be updated internally and sim ulta-\nneously  when the transfer bit is set. The internal update takes \nplace when the transfer bit is set, and then the bit autoclears.  \nData Sheet  AD9649  \n \nRev.

B | Page 30 of 32 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nDESIGN GUIDELINES  \nBefore starting the design and layout of the AD9649 as a system,  \nit is recommended that the design er become familiar with these \nguidelines, which discuss the special circuit connections and \nlayout requirements needed for certain pins.  \nPower and Ground Recommendations  \nWhen connecting power to the AD9649, it is strongly recom -\nmended that two separate supplies be used. Use one 1.8  V supply \nfor analog  (AVDD) ; use a separate 1.8  V to 3.3  V supply for the \ndigital  output  supply (DRVDD).  If a common 1.8  V AVDD and \nDRVDD supply must be used, the AVDD a nd DRVDD domains \nmust be isolated with a ferrite bead or filter choke and separate decoupling capacitors. Several different decoupling capacitors can  \nbe used to cover both high and low frequencies. Locate t hese \ncapacitors close to the point of entry at the  PCB level and close \nto the pins of the part, with minimal trace length.  \nA single PCB ground plane should be sufficient when using the AD9649. With proper decoupling and smart partitioning of the  \nPCB analog, digital, and clock sections, optimum perform ance \nis easily achieved.  \nWhen powering down the AD9649, power off AVDD and \nDRVDD  simultaneously, or DRVDD must  be removed before \nAVDD.  \nExp osed Paddle Thermal Heat Sink Recommendations  \nThe exposed paddle ( Pin 0 ) is the only ground connection for \nthe AD9649; therefore , it must be connected to analog ground \n(AGND) on the customer’s PC B. To achieve the best electrical \nand thermal performance, mate an exposed (no solder mask) \ncontinuous copper plane on the PCB to the AD9649 exposed \npaddle, Pin 0.  \nThe copper plane should have s everal vias to achieve the lowest \npossible resistive thermal path for heat dissipation to flow through the bottom of the PCB. Fill or plug these vias with nonconductive \nepoxy.  To maximize the coverage and adhesion between the ADC and the PCB, a silkscreen  should be overlaid to partition the continuous  \nplane on the PCB into several uniform sections. This provides \nseveral tie points between the ADC and the PCB during the reflow process. Using one continuous plane with no partitions guarantees  \nonly one tie po int between the ADC and the PCB.  For detailed \ninformation about packaging and PCB layout of chip scale \npackages, see t he AN-772 Application Note , A Design and \nManufacturing Guide for the Lead Fra me Chip Scale Package \n(LFCSP ). \nEncode  Clock  \nFor optimum dynamic performance , use  a low jitte r encode \nclock source with a 50% duty c ycle (±5%) to clock the AD9649.  \nVCM  \nThe VCM pin should be decoup led to ground with a 0.1 μF \ncapacitor, as shown in Figure 39. \nRBIAS  \nThe AD9649 requires that a 10 kΩ resistor be placed between \nthe RBIAS pin and ground. This resistor s ets the master current \nreference of the ADC core and should have at least a 1% to lerance.  \nReference Decoupling  \nExternally decouple  the VREF pin  to ground with a low ESR, \n1.0 μF capacitor in parallel with a low ESR, 0.1 μF ceramic \ncapacitor.  \nSPI Port  \nThe SPI port should not be active during periods when the full \ndynamic performance of the converter is required. Because the \nSCLK, CSB, and SDIO signals are typically asynchronous to the \nADC clock, noise from these signals can degrade converter \nperformance. If  the on -board SPI bus is used for other devices, \nit may be necessary to provide buffers between this bus and the \nAD9649 to keep these signals from transitioning at the converter \ninputs during cri tical sampling periods.  \nSoft Reset  \nIn applications with DRVDD ≥  2.75 V, do not perform  soft reset \n(Register 0x00 Bit  2 and Bit  5 = 1). Soft r eset restores AD9649 \ndefaults  already available at pow er-up and is not needed.  \n \n \nData Sheet  AD9649 \n \nRev.
