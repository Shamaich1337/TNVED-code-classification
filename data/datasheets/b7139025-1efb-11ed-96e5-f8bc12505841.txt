In the same way, with the rail to rail topology, the track from the V\nCC pin to the power supply and from the GND pin to GND voltage must be as short as \npossible to avoid overvoltages due to parasitic phenomena (see Figure 4. )\nIt’s often harder to connect the power supply near to the USB6B1 unlike the ground thanks \nto the ground plane that allows a short connection. To ensure the same efficiency for positive surges when the connections can’t be short enough, we recommend to putting a 100 nF c apacitor close to the USB6B1 between V\nCC and ground to prevvent these kinds of \novervoltage disturbances (see Figure 5. ) The addition of this capacitor offers better \nprotection by providing a constant voltage during the surge. \nFigure 6.  shows the improvement of the ESD protection according to the recommendations \ndescribed above. \nImportant: An imortant precaution to take is to put the protection device closer to the disturbance \nsource (generally the connection).

Specialized ports on the back of \nthe present PC will largely be replaced by USB ports. Many peripherals such as printers, key-boards, monitors and joysticks use USB ports. \nThe USB offers high speed communication rates up to 480 Mbit/s. Only two wires (D+, D-) \nare required for data transfer. Additionally, limited amount of power for USB devices located on the downstream can also be transmitted on two separate conductors within the same cable.\n2.4 Protection to support USB\nDesigners dealing with the USB chips are concerned about electrostatic discharge sensitivity (ESD) of their USB controller ICs. \nThe USB controller is more than just a driver / receiver; it acts as a microcontroller which \nmanages power and direct signal traffic. This complexity increases its cost over conventional devices. Therefore, a failure of a USB port could result in costly computer failure. \nIn order to prevent these fast transients from leading to severe damages in a system, a \nspecific protection has been developed by STMicroelectronics. The USB6Bx protects not only the two wires of data transmission, but also keep the power rails in a safe limit. \nFigure 6. Recommended configuration for USB port protection\nThe capacitance between the I/O transmission wires provides no significant signal distortion \nat the 12 Mbit/s data rate, thus allowing compatibility with USB standard. \nAvailable in a compact SO-8 this protective element requires minimal board space and \neases the PCB layout thanks to its direct compatibility with the USB connector pin-out. 1\nUSB\nICVBUS\nD+\nD-\nGND\nUSB output\nconnector\nTelecom and datacom applications USB6B1\n6/9   3 Telecom and datacom applications\nFigure 7.
