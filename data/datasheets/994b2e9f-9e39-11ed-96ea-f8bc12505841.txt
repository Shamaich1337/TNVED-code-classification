All Rights Reserved.  \nOPERATION  \nThe MPQ4569 is a 75V, 0.3A, synchronous, \nstep-down switching regulator with integrated \nhigh-side and low -side high -voltage power \nMOSFETs (HS_FET and LS_FET, respectively). \nIt provides a highly -efficient, 0.3A output. It \nfeatur es a wide input voltage range, external soft -\nstart control, and precision current limit. Its very \nlow operational quiescent current makes it \nsuitable for battery -powered applications.  \nControl  Scheme  \nThe ILIM comparator , FB comparator and zero \ncurrent detec tor (ZCD) block control the PWM. If \nVFB is below the 1V reference  and the inductor \ncurrent drops to zero, HS_FET turns on and t he \nILIM comparator starts to sense the HS_FET \ncurrent: When the HS_FET current reaches the \nlimit, the HS_FET turns off and LS_FET  turns on  \ntogether with the ZCD block. Meanwhile, the ILIM \ncomparator is turned off to reduce the quiescent \ncurrent. The LS_FET turns off together with ZCD \nblock after the inductor current drops to zero. If \nVFB is less than the 1V reference at this time, t he \nHS_FET turns on at once and commences \nanother cycle. If V FB is still higher than 1V \nreference, HS_FET would not turn on till V FB \ndrops below 1V.  \nVSWVFB\nILIpeak\nIoVREF\nIo increase\n \nFigure2  - Control Scheme  Internal Regulator  and BIAS  \nThe 2.6V internal regula tor powers most of the \ninternal circuitry. This regulator takes V IN and \noperates in the full V IN range. When V IN is greater \nthan 3.0V, the output of the regulator is in full \nregulation. Lower values of V IN result in lower \noutput voltages. When V BIAS>2.9V, the bias \nsupply overrides the input voltage and supplies \npower to the internal regulator.  When V BIAS>4.5V, \nit can power LS _FET  driver furthermore. Using \nBIAS to power internal regulator can improve the \nefficiency. It is recommended to connect BIAS to \nthe r egulated output voltage when it is in the \nrange of 2.9V to 5.5V. When output voltage is out \nof above range, an external supply that is >2.9V \nor even better >4.5V can be used  to power BIAS.  \nEnable Control  \nThe MPQ4569 has a dedicated enable -control \npin, EN: when V IN goes high, the EN pin enables \nand disables the chip. This is HIGH  logic. Its \ntrailing threshold is a consistent 1.2V. Its rising \nthreshold is about 350mV higher. When floating, \nEN pin is internally pulled down to GND to \ndisable the chip.  \nWhen EN = 0V, the chip goes into the lowest \nshutdown -current mode. When EN is higher than \nzero but lower than its rising threshold, the chip \nremains in shutdown mode with a slightly larger \nshutdown current.  \nInternally a zener diode is connected from EN pin \nto GND  pin. The typical clamping voltage of the \nzener diode is 6.5V. So VIN can be connected to \nEN through a high ohm resistor if the system \ndoesn't have another logic input acting as enable \nsignal. The resistor needs to be designed to limit \nthe EN pin sink curr ent less than 1 50μA. Just \nnote that there is an internal 3M resistor from EN \nto GND, so the external pull up resistor should be \nsmaller than \n1.55V3M 1.55V]- [V(MIN)IN \uf0b4  to make sure \nthe part can EN on at the lowest operation V IN. \n \nMPQ4569― 75V, 0.3A , SYNCHRONOUS STEP -DOWN CONVERTER  \n \nMPQ4569  Rev. 1.02 www.MonolithicPower.com  11 \n5/25/2016  MPS Proprietary Information. Patent Protected. Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibit ed. \n © 2016  MPS. All Rights Reserved.  \nUnder -Voltage Lockout  \nVIN under voltage lock out (UVLO) protects the \nchip from operating below the operational supply \nvoltage range. The UVLO -rising threshold is \nabout 4.2V while its trailing threshold is about \n3.75V.  \nSoft-start  \nReference -type soft -start prevents the converter \noutput voltage from ov ershooting during startup. \nWhen the chip starts, the internal circuitry \ngenerates a constant current to charge external \nSS capacitor. The soft -start (SS) voltage slowly \nramps up from 0V at a slow pace set by the soft -\nstart time. When V SS is less than the V REF, V SS \noverrides V REF so the FB comparator  uses V SS \ninstead of V REF as the reference. When V SS is \nhigher than V REF, VREF resumes control.  \nVSS is also associated with V FB. Though V SS can \nbe much smaller than V FB, it can only barely \nexceed V FB. If somehow VFB drops, V SS tracks \nVFB. This function prevents output voltage \novershoot in short -circuit recovery -- when the \nshort circuit is removed, the SS ramps up as if it \nis a fresh soft -start process.  \nThermal Shutdown  \nThermal shutdown prevents the chip from \nthermally running away. When the silicon die \ntemperature exceeds its upper threshold, the \nthermal shutdown feature shuts down the whole \nchip. When the temperature falls below its lower \nthreshold, the chip resumes function.  \nFloating Driver and Bootstrap Chargi ng \nThe external bootstrap capacitor powers the \nfloating HS_FET  driver.  This floating driver has \nits own UVLO protection, with a rising threshold \nof about 2.4V with a hysteresis of about 300mV. \nDuring this UVLO, the SS voltage resets to zero. \nWhen the UVLO  is disabled, the regulator follows \nthe soft -start process.  \nThe dedicated internal bootstrap regulator \ncharges and regulates the bootstrap capacitor to \nabout 5V. When the voltage difference between \nBST and SW falls below its working parameters, \na PMOS pass  transistor connected from V IN to \nBST turns on to charge the bootstrap capacitor. \nThe current path is from V IN to BST and then to  SW. The external circuit must have enough \nvoltage headroom to accommodate charging.  \nAs long as V IN is sufficiently higher th an SW, the \nbootstrap capacitor can charge. When the \nHS_FET  is ON, V IN is about equal to SW so the \nbootstrap capacitor cannot charge. The best \ncharging period occurs when the LS_FET  is on \nso that V IN - VSW is at its largest. When there is \nno current in the inductor, V SW equals V OUT so the \ndifference between V IN and V OUT can charge the \nbootstrap capacitor.  \nIf the internal circuit does not have sufficient \nvoltage and time to charge the bootstrap \ncapacitor, extra external circuitry can be used to \nensure the boo tstrap voltage in normal operation \nregion.  \nStartup and Shutdown  \nIf both V IN and V EN are higher than their \nappropriate thresholds, the chip starts operating. \nThe reference block starts first, generating stable \nreference voltage and currents, and then enable s \nthe internal regulator. The regulator provides \nstable supply for the rest device.  \nWhile the internal supply rail is high, an internal \ntimer holds the power MOSFET off for about \n50µsec to blank startup glitches. When the soft -\nstart block is enabled, it fi rst holds its SS output \nlow and then slowly ramps up.  \nThree events shut down the chip: V EN low, V IN \nlow, and junction temperature triggers the \nthermal shutdown threshold. For shutdown, the \nsignaling path is blocked first to avoid any fault \ntriggering. Inte rnal supply rail is pulled down then. \nThe floating driver is not subject to this shutdown \ncommand, but its charging path is disabled.  \nPower OK (POK)  \nPOK is an open drain power good output. “HIGH” \noutput indicates VOUT is higher than 90% of its \nnominal valu e. POK is pulled down in shutdown \nmode.  \nReference Voltage Output (VREF)  \nVREF pin output 1V reference voltage. It has up \nto 500uA source current capability.  \n \nMPQ4569― 75V, 0.3A , SYNCHRONOUS STEP -DOWN CONVERTER  \n \nMPQ4569  Rev. 1.02 www.MonolithicPower.com  12 \n5/25/2016  MPS Proprietary Information.

However, \nthe larger value inductor will have a larger \nphysical size, higher series resistance, and/or \nlower saturation current as well as the slow load \ntransient dynamic performance. There is also a \nlower limit of the inductor value, which is \ndetermin ed by the minimum on time. In order to \nkeep the inductor working under control, the \ninductor value should be chosen higher than \nLmin that is derived from below formula:  \npeakON(MIN) MAXIN\nMINIt V\nL\uf0b4\n\uf03d) (\n \nWhere V IN(MAX)  is the max value of input voltage. \ntON(MIN)  is the 120ns minimum switch on time.  \nSwitching Fr equency  \nSwitching frequency can be estimated by below \nequation.  \n\uf028\uf029\nLV IV-V VIo2f\nIN2\npeakOUT IN OUT\ns\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d\n \nLarger  inductor can get lower fs.

Once there is noise on FB, the \nmomen t HS_FET  turns on is easy to be affected, \nand then Fsw jitter would occur. The Fsw jitter is \neasy to happen especially when Vo ripple is very \nsmall. To improve the jitter performance, a small \nfeedforward capacitor between Vo and FB can \nbe used and typical 39pF is recommended.  \nPCB Layout  \nPCB layout is very important to achieve stable  \noperation. Please follow below guidelines and  \nuse Figure 5 as reference.  \n1)  Keep the path of switching current short and \nminimize the loop area formed by input \ncapacitor, high -side, low -side MOSFET and \noutput capacitor.  \n2)  Bypass ceramic capacitors should be as close \nas possible to the VIN pin.  \n3)  Make sure that all feedback connections are \nshort and direct. Place the feedback resistors \nas close to the chip as possible.  \n4)  Keep SW away from sensitive analog areas \nsuch as FB.  5)  For better thermal performance and long -term \nreliability consideration, VIN, SW and GND \nshould be connected to a large copper area \nrespectively to cool the chip.  \n \nTop Laye r \n \nBottom Layer  \n1) Layout Reference of QFN -10 Package(7) \nMPQ4569― 75V, 0.3A , SYNCHRONOUS STEP -DOWN CONVERTER  \n \nMPQ4569  Rev. 1.02 www.MonolithicPower.com  14 \n5/25/2016  MPS Proprietary Information.
