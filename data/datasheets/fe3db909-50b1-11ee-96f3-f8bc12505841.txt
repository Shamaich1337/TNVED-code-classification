The fast transient response ofD-CAP2 control reduces theoutput\ncapacitance required tomeet aspecific level ofperformance. Proprietary internal circuitry allows theuseoflow-\nESR output capacitors including ceramic andspecial polymer types.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 PWM Operation\nThe main control loop oftheTPS560200 isanadaptive on-time pulse width modulation (PWM) controller that\nsupports aproprietary D-CAP2 mode control. D-CAP2 mode control combines constant on-time control with an\ninternal compensation circuit forpseudo-fixed frequency and lowexternal component count configuration with\nboth low-ESR andceramic output capacitors. Itisstable even with virtually noripple attheoutput.\nAtthebeginning ofeach cycle, thehigh-side MOSFET isturned on.This MOSFET isturned offafter internal\none-shot timer expires. This oneshot issetbytheconverter input voltage, VIN, andtheoutput voltage, VOUT, to\nmaintain apseudo-fixed frequency over theinput voltage range, hence itiscalled adaptive on-time control. The\none-shot timer isreset andthehigh-side MOSFET isturned onagain when thefeedback voltage falls below the\nreference voltage. Aninternal ramp isadded toreference voltage tosimulate output ripple, eliminating theneed\nforESR induced output ripple from D-CAP2 mode control.\n/c40 /c41IN OUT OUT\nOUT(LL)\nOUT INV -V ×V 1I = ×2×L ×fsw V\n8TPS560200\nSLVSC81C –SEPTEMBER 2013 –REVISED FEBRUARY 2016 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: TPS560200Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2013 –2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFeature Description (continued)\n7.3.2 PWM Frequency andAdaptive On-Time Control\nTPS560200 uses anadaptive on-time control scheme and does nothave adedicated onboard oscillator. The\nTPS560200 runs with apseudo-constant frequency of600kHz byusing theinput voltage andoutput voltage to\nsettheon-time, one-shot timer. The on-time isinversely proportional totheinput voltage andproportional tothe\noutput voltage; therefore, when theduty ratio isVOUT/VIN, thefrequency isconstant.\n7.3.3 Advanced Auto-Skip Eco-Mode Control\nThe TPS560200 isdesigned with advanced auto-skip Eco-Mode toincrease higher light-load efficiency. Asthe\noutput current decreases from heavy-load condition, theinductor current isalso reduced. Iftheoutput current is\nreduced enough, theinductor current ripple valley reaches thezero level, which istheboundary between\ncontinuous conduction anddiscontinuous conduction modes. Therectifying low-side MOSFET isturned offwhen\nitszero inductor current isdetected. Astheload current further decreases theconverter runintodiscontinuous\nconduction mode. Theon-time iskept approximately thesame asisincontinuous conduction mode. Theoff-time\nincreases asittakes more time todischarge theoutput capacitor tothelevel ofthereference voltage with\nsmaller load current. The transition point tothelight load operation IOUT(LL) current can becalculated in\nEquation 1.\n(1)\n7.3.4 Soft-Start andPrebiased Soft-Start\nThe TPS560200 has aninternal 2-ms soft-start. When theENpinbecomes high, internal soft-start function\nbegins ramping upthereference voltage tothePWM comparator.\nThe TPS560200 contains aunique circuit toprevent current from being pulled from theoutput during start-up if\ntheoutput isprebiased. When thesoft-start commands avoltage higher than theprebias level (internal soft-start\nbecomes greater than feedback voltage VVSENSE ),thecontroller slowly activates synchronous rectification by\nstarting thefirst low-side FET gate driver pulses with anarrow on-time. Itthen increments that on-time ona\ncycle-by-cycle basis until itcoincides with thetime dictated by(1-D), where Distheduty cycle oftheconverter.\nThis scheme prevents theinitial sinking oftheprebias output, andensure thattheoutvoltage (VOUT)starts and\nramps upsmoothly into regulation and thecontrol loop isgiven time totransition from prebiased start-up to\nnormal mode operation.\n7.3.5 Current Protection\nThe output overcurrent protection (OCP) isimplemented using acycle-by-cycle valley detect control circuit. The\nswitch current ismonitored bymeasuring thelow-side FET switch voltage between thePHpinand GND. This\nvoltage isproportional tothe switch current. Toimprove accuracy, the voltage sensing istemperature\ncompensated.\nDuring theon-time ofthehigh-side FET switch, theswitch current increases atalinear rate determined byVIN,\nVOUT,theon-time and theoutput inductor value. During theontime ofthelow-side FET switch, thiscurrent\ndecreases linearly. The average value oftheswitch current istheload current Iout. The TPS560200 constantly\nmonitors thelow-side FET switch voltage, which isproportional totheswitch current, during thelow-side on-time.\nIfthemeasured voltage isabove thevoltage proportional tothecurrent limit, aninternal counter isincremented\npereach switching cycle andtheconverter maintains thelow-side switch onuntil themeasured voltage isbelow\nthevoltage corresponding tothecurrent limit atwhich time theswitching cycle isterminated andanew switching\ncycle begins. Insubsequent switching cycles, theon-time issettoafixed value andthecurrent ismonitored in\nthesame manner.\nThere aresome important considerations forthistype ofovercurrent protection. Thepeak current istheaverage\nload current plus one halfofthepeak-to-peak inductor current. The valley current istheaverage load current\nminus onehalfofthepeak-to-peak inductor current. Because thevalley current isused todetect theovercurrent\nthreshold, theload current ishigher than theovercurrent threshold. Also, when thecurrent isbeing limited, the\noutput voltage tends tofallasthedemanded load current may behigher than thecurrent available from the\nconverter. This protection isnonlatching. When theVSENSE voltage becomes lower than 63% ofthetarget\nvoltage, theUVP comparator detects it.After 7µsdetecting theUVP voltage, device shuts down and re-starts\nafter hiccup time.\n9TPS560200\nwww.ti.com SLVSC81C –SEPTEMBER 2013 –REVISED FEBRUARY 2016\nProduct Folder Links: TPS560200Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2013 –2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFeature Description (continued)\nWhen theovercurrent condition isremoved, theoutput voltage returns totheregulated value.\n7.3.6 Thermal Shutdown\nTPS560200 monitors thetemperature ofitself. Ifthetemperature exceeds thethreshold value (typically 170°C),\nthedevice isshut off.This isnonlatch protection.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Normal Operation\nWhen theinput voltage isabove theUVLO threshold and theENvoltage isabove theenable threshold, the\nTPS560200 canoperate initsnormal switching modes. Normal continuous conduction mode (CCM) occurs when\ntheminimum switch current isabove 0A.InCCM, theTPS560200 operates ataquasi-fixed frequency of600\nkHz.\n7.4.2 Eco-Mode Operation\nWhen theTPS560200 isinthenormal CCM operating mode andtheswitch current falls to0A,theTPS560200\nbegins operating inpulse-skipping Eco-Mode. Each switching cycle isfollowed byaperiod ofenergy-saving\nsleep time. Thesleep time ends when theVFB voltage falls below theEco-Mode threshold voltage. Astheoutput\ncurrent decreases theperceived time between switching pulses increases.\n7.4.3 Standby Operation\nWhen theTPS560200 isoperating ineither normal CCM orEco-Mode, itmay beplaced instandby byasserting\ntheENpinlow.\nF =P\nOUT OUT1\n2 L x C/c112\nOUTR1 0.8 VR2 =V -0.8V/c180\n10µFC410µH L1\n10µFC5VIN 4.5-17V VOUT 1.05V, 0.5 A\n0.1µFC2 C3TPS560200\nVIN4\nEN1\nVSENSE5GND2PH3U1\n10µFC1\n6.19kR1\n20.0kR2open\n10TPS560200\nSLVSC81C –SEPTEMBER 2013 –REVISED FEBRUARY 2016 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: TPS560200Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2013 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated8Application andImplementation\nNOTE\nInformation inthe following applications sections isnot part ofthe TIcomponent\nspecification, and TIdoes notwarrant itsaccuracy orcompleteness.

The maximum recommended\noperating duty cycle is65%. Using thatcriteria, theminimum recommended input voltage isVO/0.65.\n10Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nTheVINpinshould bebypassed toground with alow-ESR ceramic bypass capacitor. Take care tominimize the\nloop area formed bythebypass capacitor connection, theVIN pin, and theGND pinoftheIC.The typical\nrecommended bypass capacitance is10-μFceramic with aX5R orX7R dielectric andtheoptimum placement is\nclosest totheVIN and GND pins ofthedevice. Anadditional high-frequency bypass capacitor may beadded.\nSee Figure 19foraPCB layout example. TheGND pinshould betiedtothePCB ground plane atthepinofthe\nIC.The PHpinshould berouted toasmall copper area directly adjacent tothepin.Make thecirculating loop\nfrom PHtotheoutput inductor, output capacitors and back toGND astight aspossible while preserving\nadequate etch width toreduce conduction losses inthecopper. Connect theexposed thermal padtobottom or\ninternal layer ground plane using vias asshown. Additional vias may beused adjacent totheICtotietop-side\ncopper totheinternal orbottom layer copper. The additional external components canbeplaced approximately\nasshown. Itmay bepossible toobtain acceptable performance with alternate layout schemes; however, this\nlayout produced good results andisintended asaguideline.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 19.Layout Schematic\n15TPS560200\nwww.ti.com SLVSC81C –SEPTEMBER 2013 –REVISED FEBRUARY 2016\nProduct Folder Links: TPS560200Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2013 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated11Device andDocumentation Support\n11.1 Device Support\n11.1.1 Third-Party Products Disclaimer\nTI\'S PUBLICATION OFINFORMATION REGARDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS ORSERVICES DOES NOT\nCONSTITUTE ANENDORSEMENT REGARDING THE SUITABILITY OFSUCH PRODUCTS ORSERVICES\nORAWARRANTY, REPRESENTATION ORENDORSEMENT OFSUCH PRODUCTS ORSERVICES, EITHER\nALONE ORINCOMBINATION WITH ANY TIPRODUCT ORSERVICE.\n11.2 Trademarks\nEco-Mode, D-CAP2 aretrademarks ofTexas Instruments.\nWEBENCH isaregistered trademark ofTexas Instruments.\nAllother trademarks aretheproperty oftheir respective owners.\n11.3 Electrostatic Discharge Caution\nThese devices have limited built-in ESD protection.
