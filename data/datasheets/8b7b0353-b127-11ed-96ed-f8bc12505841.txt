Lux Calculation using  DATA0 and DATA1  \nBH1730FVC has two outputs, DATA0 (14h, 15h) for detecting mainly visible light , and DATA1 (16h, 17h) for detecting  \nmainly  infrared light. Lux value can be calculated by using these two outputs. The calculation formula depends on the \ncharacteristic of optical window. The example of the calculation is shown as below . \n   \nEx) No optical window or optical window that has flat tra nsmittanc e from visible light to infrared light.  \nif (DATA1/DATA0<0.26)   Lx = ( 1.290  x DATA0 - 2.733  x DATA1 ) / Gain x 102.6 / ITIME _ms  \nelse if (DATA1/DATA0<0.55)   Lx = ( 0.795  x DATA0 - 0.859  x DATA1 ) / Gain x 102.6  / ITIME _ms  \nelse if (DATA1/DATA0<1.09)   Lx = ( 0.510  x DATA0 - 0.345  x DATA1 ) / Gain x 102.6 / ITIME _ms  \nelse if (DATA1/DATA0<2.13)   Lx = ( 0.276  x DATA0 - 0.130  x DATA1 ) / Gain x 102.6 / ITIME _ms  \nelse     Lx=0  \n \n   ITIME_ms  : Integration time of measurement  (unit: ms). Please refer to TIMING register on P9. \n7. Interrupt Function  \nInterrupt function compares measurement result to preset interrupt threshold level. BH1730FVC uses two threshold level s \n(upper and lower). If measurement result is outside of the two threshold s, INT pin outputs \'L\'. Interrupt threshold is set in \nInterrupt threshold registers (03h - 06h). \n \nInterrupt function is control led by the Interrupt ope rational code. Interrupt persi stence is  set by PERSIST bit in \nINTERRUPT register (02h<3:0>).   \nINT pin is an Nch open drain terminal . Hence  this terminal has to have a n external pull-up resistor to a voltage source . \nMaximum sink current rating of this terminal is 7mA.  \nINT terminal state is high impedance when VCC is supplied.  \nINT terminal becomes inactive by setting "Interrupt output reset " of special command. VCC current  is consumed when  \nINT terminal is \'L\'. So it is recommended to reset INT terminal immediately when interrupt is detected.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14/20  TSZ02201 -0M3M0F616050 -1-2 © 2012 ROHM Co., Ltd.

ALS Sensitivity Adjustment Function  \nBH1730FVC is capa ble of chang ing its ALS sensitivity. This is used to c ompensate  the effect of attenuation by the optical \nwindow . Adjustment is done by changing the integration time.

Reverse Connection of Power Supply  \nConnecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take pr ecautions  against reverse polarity when \nconnecting the power supply , such as mounting an external diode between the power supply  and the IC ’s power \nsupply pin s. \n \n2. Power Supply Lines  \nDesign the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at \nall power supply pins . Consider the effect of temperature and aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic \ncapacitors.  \n \n3. Ground Voltage  \nEnsure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.  \n \n4. Ground Wiring Pattern  \nWhen using both small -signal and large -current ground  traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but \nconnected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small -signal \nground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground  traces of ext ernal components do not cause variations \non the ground  voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.  \n \n5. Thermal Consideration  \nShould by any chance the power dissipation rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in \ndeterioration of the properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, increase the board size \nand copper area to prevent exceeding the Pd rating.  \n \n6. Recommended Operating Conditions  \nThese conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately obtained . \nThe e lectrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter . \n \n7. Inrush Current  \nWhen power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may flow \ninstantaneously due to the internal  powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power \nsupply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring, and \nrouting of connections.  \n \n8. Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field  \nOperating  the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction . \n \n9. Testing on Application Boards  \nWhen testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low -impedance output pin may \nsubject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply \nshould always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection \nprocess. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the  IC during assembly and use similar precautions during \ntransport and storage.  \n \n10. Inter -pin Short and Mounting Errors  \nEnsure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in \ndamaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each o ther especially to ground , power supply and output pin . \nInter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and \nunintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a fe w. \n \n11. Unused Input Pins  \nInput pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a  MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and \nextremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small \ncharge acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the cond uction through the transistor and \ncause unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the \npower supply or ground line.  \n \n \n \n17/20  TSZ02201 -0M3M0F616050 -1-2 © 2012 ROHM Co., Ltd.

Regarding the Input Pin of the IC  \nThis monolit hic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them \nisolated. P -N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a \nparasitic diode or transistor. For ex ample (refer to figure below):  \n When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P -N junction operates as a parasitic diode.  \n When GND > Pin B, the P -N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.  \nParasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual \ninterference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to \noperate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thu s to the P substrate) should be \navoided.     \nFigure 3. Example of monolithic IC structure  \n \n13. Ceramic Capacitor  \nWhen using a ceramic capacitor, determine the dielectric constant considering the change of capacitance with \ntemperature and the decrease in nominal  capacitance due to DC bias and others.  \n \n14. Area of Safe Operation (ASO)  \nOperate the IC such that the output voltage, output current, and power dissipation are all within the Area of Safe \nOperation (ASO).  \n \nN NP+ P\nN NP+\nP Substrate\nGNDNP+\nN NP+NP\nP Substrate\nGND GNDParasitic \nElementsPin A\nPin APin B Pin B\nB C\nE\nParasitic \nElements\nGND\nParasitic \nElementsCB\nETransistor (NPN) Resistor\nN Region\nclose-byParasitic \nElements\n \n \n18/20  TSZ02201 -0M3M0F616050 -1-2 © 2012 ROHM Co., Ltd.
