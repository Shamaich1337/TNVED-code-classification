Therefore the application’s ambient\ntemperature, T\nA\n (\no\nC), and thermal resistance R\nθ\nJA\n (\no\nC/W)\nmust be reviewed to ensure that T\nJM\n is never exceeded.\nEquation 1 mathematically represents the relationship and\nserves as the basis for establishing the rating of the part.\nIn using surface mount devices such as the TO-252\npackage, the environment in which it is applied will have a\nsignificant influence on the part’s current and maximum\npower dissipation ratings. Precise determination of P\nDM\n is\ncomplex and influenced by many factors:\n1. Mounting pad area onto which the device is attached and\nwhether there is copper on one side or both sides of the\nboard.\n2. The number of copper layers and the thickness of the\nboard.\n3. The use of external heat sinks.\n4. The use of thermal vias.\n5. Air flow and board orientation.\n6. For non steady state applications, the pulse width, the\nduty cycle and the transient thermal response of the part,\nthe board and the environment they are in.\nFairchild provides thermal information to assist the\ndesigner’s preliminary application evaluation. Figure 20\ndefines the R\nθ\nJA\n for the device as a function of the top\ncopper (component side) area. This is for a horizontally\npositioned FR-4 board with 1oz copper after 1000 seconds\nof steady state power with no air flow. This graph provides\nthe necessary information for calculation of the steady state\njunction temperature or power dissipation. Pulse\napplications can be evaluated using the Fairchild device\nSpice thermal model or manually utilizing the normalized\nmaximum transient thermal impedance curve.\nThermal resistances corresponding to other copper areas\ncan be obtained from Figure 20 or by calculation using\nEquation 2 or 3. Equation 2 is used for copper area defined\nin inches square and equation 3 is for area in centimeters\nsquare. The area, in square inches or square centimeters is\nthe top copper area including the gate and source pads.\n(EQ. 1)\nP\nDM\nT\nJM\nT\nA\n–\n()\nR\nθ\nJA\n-----------------------------\n=\nArea in Inches Squared\n(EQ. 2)\nR\nθ\nJA\n33.32\n23.84\n0.268\nArea\n+\n()\n------------------------------------\n-\n+\n=\n(EQ. 3)\nR\nθ\nJA\n33.32\n154\n1.73\nArea\n+\n()\n---------------------------------\n-\n+\n=\nArea in Centimeters Squared\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nFigure 20.
