Operation  \nThe AP 3162  is a high performance  and high power LED \ncontroller  with accurately  constant  current output  in a wide \ninput range from 9V to 3 5V. This  constant  current can  be \nprogramed through the ADIM  pin voltage  or set by the \nexternal PWM diming duty cycle .  \nWith the  internal  slope compensated current mode PWM \ncontrol, the AP 3162  provides stable  switching and cycle -by-\ncycle current limit for protection of the external MOSFET.  \n \n2. Input Under -voltage Lockout (UVLO)  \nAn input UVLO circuit prevents the converter from starting \nthe operation until the input voltage rises above the typical \nUVLO threshol d of 8V. And when input decrease to a \nhysteresis voltage of 500mV, The AP 3162  will be lo ckout \nuntil to input reaching 8 V again.  \n \n3. Enable & Soft-start  \nAs for AP3162, a voltage on ENA pin greater than 2V \nenables the IC and a voltage less than 0.8V disables  it. \nOnce enabled, t he AP 3162  implements the soft -start function \nto reduce the inrush current during startup. The soft -start \nbegins once the input voltage raises above typical UVLO \nthreshold.  \n \n4. Setting the Oscillator Frequency  \nFollowed equation can be us ed to calculate the operating \nfrequency of the controller, given the resistance value on RI \npin: \nFOSC(kHz) =25026\nRRI(kΩ)                                                            (1) \nTo make a compromise between component size and \nswitching losse s, AP3162 supports a n oscillator  range from \n100kHz to  a clamped frequency  as high as 400 kHz.  \n \n5. Setting the LED Current  \nThe LED current is limited to a minimum of about 5mA. \nIdentical currents in all 4 LED strings can be obtained by \nsetting the voltage a nd resistance value at ISET pin, as shown \nin the  following equation : \nILED[mA] =2016×VISET\nRISET[kΩ]                                              (2) \nThe lowest voltage in 4 LED strings is fed to error -amplifier \nto regulate the boost converters output voltage. Thus, a \nrelationship between the LED current and its voltage drop is \nestablished, as can b e seen in Figure 1,  \nFigure 1 LED current V.S. LED X voltage  \n \n6. Dimming Control  \nFor a flexible brightness control , the AP 3162  provides both \nthe PWM pulse and analog input signal to achieve dimming \nfunction . As for analog dimming, the LED current is decide d \nby ISET pin voltage, which in turn is determined by ADIM \npin voltage. ISET pin voltage changes while ADIM pin \nvoltage changes, according to the Figure 2below:  \n \nFigure 2 VISET V.S. V ADIM voltage  \nISET voltage would be clamped to a minimum of about 2V \nwhen ADIM is greater than 3V.  \nFor PWM dimming, the brightness is simply controlled by \nthe PWM duty : \nILED[mA] =2016×VISET\nRISET[kΩ]×DPWM                                   (3) \n \n7. Cycle by Cycle Peak Current Limit  Protection  \nThe peak current limit p revents the AP 3162  from high inductor \ncurrent and drawing excessive current from the input voltage \nrail. It also can protect the external MOSFT from over current \nsituation.  \n \n8. Working @  3 LED Strings  \nTo improve the design flexibility, the AP3162 could dis able \nthe 4th channel in system where only 3 LED strings are \nrequired. And this can be done by short RI pin and VCC pin.  250350450550650750850950\n5 105 205 305 405LEDX Voltage (mV)\nLED Current(mA)\n\nAP3162   Chipown  \n \n \nwww.chipown.com                                                                          Wuxi Chipown Microelectronics Limited                                                 Rev. 0.2                                                7/9  9. Diode/Inductor Short  Protection  \nA permanent damage will be made on the power MOSFET if \nthe inductor or the Schottky diode shorts whic h introduces an \nexcessively large current . A consecutive 17 cycles in which \nCS>1.2V is observed will lead to the AP3162 shutdown and \nlatched.  \n \n10. LED Short Protection  \nWhen any of the LED strings is shorted, LED pin voltage will \nbe pulled high enough to ex ceed a preset threshold level. The \ncorresponding strings would be turned off after an expiration \nof protection debounce timer. The normal operation c an be \nreassumed only by restarting  the system . \n \n11. LED Open Protection  \nThe Over Voltage Protection is dete cted by the OVP pin, \nconnected to the resistors divider between V OUT to GND. \nWhen any of the LED strings is/are opened, V OVP goes above  \nOVP threshold, the AP3162 will skip the opened strings while \nthe remaining strings still maintains normal regulation. \nHowever, the IC will be shut down and stay latched when all \n4 strings are opened.  The normal operation c an be reassumed \nonly by restarting  the V IN or PWM.  \n \n12. LED Cathode Short to GND Protection  \nGiven  one of the LED pin s is shorted to ground , there are two  \ncases that may happen. In one case the system output continues \nto rise until OVP>2.5V and triggered LED open protection. In \nthe other case the OVP voltage is limited by OCP power level. \nUnder such circumstances the CMP pin voltage will be pulled high enou gh to shut  down the system, thus to avoid the \npermanent damage to board component caused by  this \nexcessively large channel current.   \n \n13. Thermal Fold  Back and Thermal Shutdown  \nA thermal shutdown is implemented to prevent the damage \ndue to excessive heat and power dissipation. Typically, the \nthermal shutdown happens at the junction temperature of \n150 ° C. Besides this, the system can be further optimized by \ngradually reduce ing the output current with t he increasing \ntemperature . And this so called  thermal fold  back function  is \ninitiated at a temperature about 140 °C. Finally once  the \nthermal shutdown is triggered, the device stops switching until \nthe junction temperature drops the hysteresis temperature \nlower than thermal shutdown threshold, then the device starts \nswitching again.  \n \nLayout Guidance  \nFor best performance of the AP 3162 , the following guidelines \nmust be strictly followed.  \n1. Input and Output capacitors should be placed close to the IC \nand conn ected to ground plane to reduce noise coupling.  \n2. The GND should be connected to a strong ground plane for \nheat sinking and noise protection.   \n3. Separate the high frequency switching  and heavy current \ntracks  (gate driver, MOSFET, inductor, Schottky diode  and CS \nreturn ends)  from the sensitive control signals , and keep the \nmain current traces as possible as short and wide . \n4. Place the feedback components as close as possible to the \nIC and keep away from the noisy devices.  \n \n  \nAP3162   Chipown  \n \n \nwww.chipown.com                                                                          Wuxi Chipown Microelectronics Limited                                                 Rev. 0.2                                                8/9  Package Information  \nPackage Outline and Dimensions  \n \n \nSize \nSymbol  Min.\nmm\n  Max.\nmm\n  Size \nSymbol  Min.\nmm\n  Max.\nmm\n  \nA -- 1.650  e 1.270(BSC)  \nA1 0.000  0.100  E 5.900 6.100 \nA2 1.350 1.550 E1 3.800 4.000 \nb 0.330 0.510 E2 2.240 2.490 \nc 0.170 0.250 L 0.400 1.270  \nD 9.800  10.000 θ 0° 8° \nD1 4.930  5.180     \n \nNotes:   \n1.
