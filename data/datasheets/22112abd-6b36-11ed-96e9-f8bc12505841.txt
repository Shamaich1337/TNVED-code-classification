GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nProduct overview\n1P r o d u c t  o v e r v i e w\nThe GL-T family consists of 512-Mb to 1-Gb, 3.0 V core, versatile I/O, non-volatile, flash memory devices. These \ndevices have an 8-bit (byte) / 16-bit (word) wide data bus and use only byte/word boundary addresses. All read \naccesses provide 8/16 bits of data on each bus transfer cycle. All writes take 8/16 bits of data from each bus \ntransfer cycle. \nFigure 1 Block diagram[1] \nThe GL-T family combines the best features of eXecut e-in-Place (XIP) and data storage flash memories. This \nfamily has the fast random access of XIP flash along with the high density and fast program speed of data storage flash. \nRead access to any random location takes 100 ns to 120 ns depending on device density and I/O power supply \nvoltage. Each random (initial) access reads an entire 32-byte aligned group of data called a page. Other words \nwithin the same page may be read by changing only the low order 4 bits of word address. Each access within the same page takes 15 ns to 25 ns. This is called page mode read. Changing any of the higher word address bits will select a different page and begin a new initial access. All read accesses are asynchronous.

HIC monitors signal levels on the device inputs and drives outputs as \nneeded to complete read and write data transfers with the host system. HIC delivers data from the currently \nentered address space on read transfers; places writ e transfer address and data information into the EAC \ncommand memory; notifies the EAC of power transition, ha rdware reset, and write transfers. The EAC looks in \nthe command memory, after a write transfer, for legal command sequences and performs the related embedded algorithms.\nChanging the non-volatile data in the memory array requ ires a complex sequence of operations that are called \nembedded algorithms (EA). Th e algorithms are managed entirely by the device internal EAC. The main algorithms \nperform programming and erase of the main array data. The host system writes command codes to the flash \ndevice address space. The EAC receives the commands , performs all the necessary steps to complete the \ncommand, and provides status information during the progress of an EA.\nThe erased state of each memory bit is a logic 1. Progra mming changes a logic 1 (HIGH) to a logic 0 (LOW). Only \nan erase operation is able to change ‘0’ to ‘1’ . An erase operation must be performed on an entire 128-KB aligned and length group of data call a sector. When shipped from Infineon all sectors are erased.\nProgramming is done via a 512-byte write buffer. In ×16 it  is possible to write from 1 to 256 words, anywhere \nwithin the write buffer before starting a programming op eration. Within the flash me mory array, each 512-byte \naligned group of 512 bytes is called a line. In ×8 it is po ssible to write from 1 to 256 bytes, anywhere within the \nwrite buffer before starting a program operation. A prog ramming operation transfers volatile data from the write \nbuffer to a non-volatile memory array Line. Th e operation is called write buffer programming.\nAs the device transfers each 32-byte aligned page of data  that was loaded into the write buffer to the 512-byte \nflash array line, internal logic programs an ECC code for the page into a portion of the memory array not visible to the host system software. The internal logic checks the ECC information during the initial access of every array \nread operation. If needed, the ECC information corr ects a one bit error during the initial access time.\nThe write buffer is filled with 1’s after reset or the completion of any operation using the write buffer. Any \nlocations not written to a ‘0’ by a write to buffer command are by default still filled with 1’s. Any 1’s in the write \nbuffer do not affect data in the memory array during a programming operation. \nAs each page of data that was loaded into the wr ite buffer is transferred to a memory array line. \nSectors may be individually protected from program and erase operations by the advanced sector protection \n(ASP) feature set. ASP provides several, hardware and software controlled, volatile and non-volatile, methods to select which sectors are protected from program and erase operations.

This area \ncontains the device identification (ID) and common flash interface (CFI) information tables.\n• Secure silicon region (SSR): a one time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory array used for Infineon factory \nprogrammed permanent data, and customer programmable permanent data. \n• Lock register: an OTP non-volatile word used to configure the ASP features and lock the SSR.\n• Persistent protection bits (PPB): a non-volatile fl ash memory array with one bit for each sector. When \nprogrammed, each bit protects the related sector from erasure and programming. \n• PPB lock: a volatile register bit used to enable or disable programming and erasure of the PPB bits.\n• Array password: an OTP non-volatile array used to stor e a 64-bit password used to enable changing the state \nof the PPB lock bit when using password mode sector protection.\n• SSR3 password: an OTP non-volatile array used to store a 64-bit password used to enable reading the SSR3.\n• Dynamic protection bits (DYB): a volatile array with on e bit for each sector. When set, each bit protects the \nrelated sector from erasure and programming.\n• Status Register: a volatile register used to display embedded algorithm status.\n• Data polling status: a volatile register used as an alternate, legacy software compatible, way to display \nembedded algorithm status.\n• ECC status: provides the status of any error detection or  correction action taken when reading the selected page.\nThe main flash memory array is the primary and default address space but, it may be overlaid by one other \naddress space, at any one time. Each alternate addr ess space is called an address space overlay (ASO). \nEach ASO replaces (overlays) the entire flash device addr ess range. Any address range not defined by a particular \nASO address map, is reserved for future use. All read accesses outside of an ASO address map returns non-valid \n(undefined) data. The location s will display actively driven data but th e meaning of whatever 1’s or 0’s appear \nare not defined.\nThere are four device operating modes that determine what appears in the flash device address space at any \ngiven time: \n• Read mode \n• Data polling mode\n•S t a t u s  R e g i s t e r  ( S R )  m o d e• Address space overlay (ASO) mode\nDatasheet 9 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nAddress space overlays\nIn Read mode the entire flash memory array may be dire ctly read by the host system memory controller. The \nmemory device EAC, puts the device in Read mode duri ng power-on, after a hardware reset, after a command \nreset, or after an EA is suspended. Read accesses and command writes are accepted in read mode. A subset of \ncommands are accepted in read mode when an EA is suspended. \nWhile in any mode, the Status Register read command may be issued to cause the Status Register ASO to appear \nat every word address in the device address space. In th is Status Register ASO Mode, the device interface waits \nfor a read access and, any write access is ignored. The ne xt read access to the device accesses the content of the \nstatus register, exits the Status Register ASO, and returns to the previous (calling) mode in which the Status Register read command was received.\nIn EA mode, the EAC is performing an EA, such as progra mming or erasing a non-volatile memory array. While in \nEA mode, none of the main flash memory array is read able because the entire flash device address space is \nreplaced by the data polling status ASO. Data polling st atus will appear at every word location in the device \naddress space.\nWhile in EA mode, only a program/erase suspend comma nd or the Status Register Read command will be \naccepted. All other commands are ignored. Thus, no other ASO may be entered from the EA mode.\nWhen an EA is suspended, the data polling ASO is visibl e until the device has suspended the EA. When the EA is \nsuspended the data polling ASO is exited and flash array da ta is available. The data polling ASO is reentered when \nthe suspended EA is resumed, until the EA is again suspended or finished. When an EA is completed, the data polling ASO is exited and the device goes to the prev ious (calling) mode (from which the EA was started).\nIn ASO mode, one of the remaining over lay address spaces is entered (overl aid on the main flash array address \nmap). Only one ASO may be entered at any one time. Comm ands to the device affect the currently entered ASO. \nOnly certain commands are valid for each ASO. These are listed in the Table 23 , in each ASO related section of \nthe table.\nThe following ASOs have non-volatile data th at may be programmed to change 1’s to 0’s:\n• Secure silicon region \n•L o c k  r e g i s t e r\n• Persistent protection bits (PPB) •P a s s w o r d\n• Only the PPB ASO has non-volatile data that may be erased to change 0’s to 1’s\nWhen a program or erase command is issued while one of the non-volatile ASOs is en tered, the EA operates on \nthe ASO. The ASO is not readable while the EA is active . When the EA is completed the ASO remains entered and \nis again readable. Suspend and resu me commands are ignored during an EA operating on any of these ASOs.\nDatasheet 10 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nAddress space overlays\n2.1 Flash memory array\nThe S29GL-T family has uniform sector architecture with a sector size of 128 kB.

One \nhas traditionally been called autoselect and is now referred  to as device identification (ID). The other method is \ncalled common flash interface (CFI).\nFor ID, a command is used to enable an address space overlay where up to 16 word locations can be read to get \nJEDEC manufacturer identification (ID), device ID, and some configuration and protection status information \nfrom the flash memory. The system can use the manufactur er and device IDs to select the appropriate driver \nsoftware to use with the flash device. \nCFI also uses a command to enable an address space over lay where an extendable table of standard information \nabout how the flash memory is organized and operates can be read. With this method the driver software does \nnot have to be written with the specif ics of each possible memory device in  mind. Instead the driver software is \nwritten in a more general way to handle many different devices but adjusts the driver behavior based on the information in the CFI table. \nTraditionally these two address spaces have used separa te commands and were separate overlays. However, the \nmapping of these two address spaces are non-overlapping and so can be combined in to a single address space \nand appear together in a single overlay. Either of the traditional commands used to access (enter) the autoselect \n(ID) or CFI overlay will cause the now combined ID-CFI address map to appear. \nThe ID-CFI address map appears ov erlays the entire flash array.\nThe ID-CFI address map starts at location 0 of the sele cted sector. Locations above the maximum defined address \nof the ID-CFI ASO to the maximum address of the selected sector have undefined data. The ID-CFI enter \ncommands use the same address and data values used on  previous generation memories to access the JEDEC \nmanufacturer ID (autoselect) an d CFI information, respectively.\nFor the complete address map see Table 25 .\n2.2.1 Device ID\nThe Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) standard JEP106T defines the manufacturer ID for a \ncompliant memory. Common industry usage defined a meth od and format for reading the manufacturer ID and \na device specific ID from a memory device. The manufactur er and device ID information is primarily intended for \nprogramming equipment to automatically match a device with the corresponding programming algorithm. Infineon has added additional fields within this 32-byte address space.\nThe original industry format was structured to work wi th any memory data bus width e. g. ×8, ×16, ×32. The ID \ncode values are traditionally byte wide but are located at bus width address boundaries such that incrementing \nthe device address inputs will read successive byte, wo rd, or double word locations with the ID codes always \nlocated in the least significant byte location of the data bus. Because the device data bus is word wide each code \nbyte is located in the lower half of each word location . The original industry format made the high order byte \nalways ‘0’ . Infineon has modified the format to use both bytes in some words of the address space.

The \ndata structure contains information for system configurat ion such as various electric al and timing parameters, \nand special functions supported by the device. Softwa re support can then be device-independent, device \nID-independent, and forward-and-backward-com patible for entire Flash device families. \nThe system can read CFI information at the addr esses within the selected sector as shown in “Device ID and \nCommon Flash Interface (ID-CFI) ASO map” on page 64.\nLike the device ID information, CFI information is struct ured to work with any memory data bus width e. g. ×8, \n×16, ×32. The code values are always byte wide but are lo cated at data bus width address boundaries such that \nincrementing the device address reads successive byte, word, or double word locations with the codes always \nlocated in the least significant byte location of the data bus. Because the data bus is word wide each code byte \nis located in the lower half of each word location and the high order byte is always ‘0’ .\nFor further information, refer to the CFI Specification, Version 1.4  (or later), and the JEDEC publications JEP137-A \nand JESD68.01 . Please contact JEDEC ( www.jedec.org ) for their standards.\n2.3 Status Register ASO\nThe Status Register ASO contains a single word of regist ered volatile status for EA’s. When the Status Register \nread command is issued, the current status is captured (b y the rising edge of WE#) in to the register and the ASO \nis entered. The Status Register content appears on all wo rd locations. The first read access exits the Status \nRegister ASO (with the rising edge of  CE# or OE#) and returns to the address space map in use when the Status \nRegister read command was issued. Write commands will not exit the Status Register ASO state.\n2.4 Data polling status ASO\nThe data polling status ASO contains a single word of volatile memory indicating the progress of an EA. The data polling status ASO is entered immediately following the last write cycle of any command sequence that initiates \nan EA. Commands that initiate an EA are:\n• Word program\n• Program buffer to flash•C h i p  e r a s e\n•S e c t o r  e r a s e\n• Erase resume / program resume• Program resume enhanced method\n•B l a n k  c h e c k\n•L o c k  r e g i s t e r  p r o g r a m•P a s s w o r d  p r o g r a m\n•P P B  p r o g r a m\n• All PPB erase• Evaluate erase status\nThe data polling status word appears at all word location s in the device address space. When an EA is completed \nthe data polling status ASO is exited and the device address space returns to the address map mode where the \nEA was started.\n2.5 SSR ASO\nThe SSR provides an extra memory area that can be programmed once and permanently protected from further changes, i. e., it is a one time program (OTP) area. Th e SSR is 2048 bytes in length. It consists of 512 bytes for \nDatasheet 13 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nAddress space overlays\nfactory locked secure silicon region (SSR0), 1024 bytes for customer locked secure silicon regions (SSR1 and \nSSR2), and 512 bytes for customer  locked secure silicon region with read password (SSR3). \nSSR0 is shipped locked, preventing further programming. SS R1 and SSR2 are OTP with each having separate lock \nbits and once locked no further programming is allowed for that region. SSR3 is an OTP and requires a SSR3 \npassword to read or program that region. Once SSR3 is locked no further programming is allowed for that region.\nThe sector address supplied during the Secure Silicon En try command selects the flash memory array sector that \nis overlaid by the SSR address map. The SSR is overlaid st arting at location 0 in the selected sector. Use of the \nsector 0 address is recommended for future compatibility.  While the SSR ASO is entered the content of all other \nsectors is memory core data for read operations. Program is not allowed outside of ASO.\nTable 5 SSR\nWord address range Byte address range Content Region  Size\n(SA) + 0000h to 00FFh (SA) + 0000h to 01FFh Factory locked secure silicon region SSR0 512 bytes\n(SA) + 0100h to 01FFh (SA) + 0200h to 03FFh Customer locked secure silicon region SSR1 512 bytes(SA) + 0200h to 02FFh (SA) + 0400h to 05FFh Customer locked secure silicon region SSR2 512 bytes\n(SA) + 0300h to 03FFh (SA) + 0600h to 07FFhCustomer locked secure silicon region \nwith read passwordSSR3 512 bytes\n(SA) + 0400h to FFFFh (SA) + 08 00h to 1FFFFh Undefined n/a 126 KB\nDatasheet 14 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nAddress space overlays\n2.6 Sector protection control\n2.6.1 Lock Register ASO\nThe lock register ASO contains a single word of OTP me mory. When the ASO is entered the lock register appears \nat all word locations in the device address space. Howe ver, it is recommended to read or program the lock \nregister only at location ‘0’ of the device address space for future compatibility.\n2.6.2 Persistent protection bits (PPB) ASO\nThe PPB ASO contains one bit of a flash memory array for ea ch sector in the device. When the PPB ASO is entered, \nthe PPB bit for a sector appears in the least significant bi t (LSB) of each address in the sector. Reading any address \nin a sector displays data where the LSB indicates the non-volatile protection status for that sector. However, it is recommended to read or program the PPB only at address ‘0’ of the sector for future compatibility. If the bit is ‘0’ , the sector is protected against programming and erase operations. If the bit is ‘1’ , the sector is not protected by the PPB. The sector may be protected by other features of ASP . \n2.6.3 PPB lock ASO\nThe PPB lock ASO contains a single bit of volatile memo ry. The bit controls whether the bits in the PPB ASO may \nbe programmed or erased. If the bit is ‘0’ , the PPB AS O is protected against programming and erase operations. \nIf the bit is ‘1’ , the PPB ASO is not protected. When the PPB lock ASO is entered the PPB lock bit appears in the least significant bit (LSB) of each address in the device address space. However, it is recommended to read or \nprogram the PPB lock only at address ‘0’ of the device for future compatibility.\n2.6.4 Password ASO\nThe Password ASO contains four words of OTP memory. When the ASO is entered the password appears starting \nat address ‘0’ in the device address space. All locations above the fourth word are undefined.\n2.6.5 Dynamic protection bits (DYB) ASO\nThe DYB ASO contains one bit of a volatile memory array for each sector in the device. When the DYB ASO is entered, the DYB bit for a sector appears in the least sign ificant bit (LSB) of each address in the sector. Reading \nany address in a sector displays data where the LSB indica tes the non-volatile protection status for that sector. \nHowever, it is recommended to read, set, or clear the DYB only at address 0 of the sector for future compatibility. \nIf the bit is ‘0’ , the sector is protected against programming  and erase operations. If the bit is ‘1’ , the sector is not \nprotected by the DYB. The sector may be protected by other features of ASP .\nDatasheet 15 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nAddress space overlays\n2.7 ECC status ASO\nThe system can access the ECC status ASO by issuing th e ECC Status entry command sequence during Read Mode. \nThe ECC status ASO provides the enabled or disabled status of the ECC function or if the ECC function corrected \na single-bit error when reading the selected Page. “Automatic ECC” on page 25 describes the ECC function in \nmore detail. \nThe ECC Status ASO allows the following activities:\n• Read ECC Status for the selected page. \n•A S O  E x i t .\n2.7.1 ECC status\nThe contents of the ECC status ASO indicate, for the selected ECC Page, whether the ECC logic has corrected an \nerror in the ECC page eight bit ECC code, in the ECC page of  32-bytes of data, or that ECC is disabled for that ECC \nunit.

During POR, the device cannot be selected, \nwill not accept commands on the rising edge of WE#, an d does not drive outputs. The host interface controller \n(HIC) and embedded algorithm controller (EAC) are reset to their standby states, ready for reading array data, \nduring POR. CE# or OE# must go to VIH before the end of POR (tVCS).\nAt the end of POR the device conditions are:\n• all internal configuration information is loaded,\n• the device is in read mode,• the Status Register is at default value,\n• all bits in the DYB ASO are set to un-protect all sectors,\n• the Write Buffer is loaded with all 1’s,• the EAC is in the standby state.\n3.1.2 Low VCC write inhibit\nWhen VCC is less than VLKO, the HIC does not accept any write cycles and the EAC resets. This protects data during \nVCC power-up and power-down. The system must provide the proper signals to the control pins to prevent \nunintentional writes when VCC is greater than VLKO.\n3.2 Command protection\nEA’s are initiated by writing command sequences into the EAC command memory. The command memory array is not readable by the host system and has no ASO. Each  host interface write is a command or part of a command \nsequence to the device. The EAC examines the address and data in each write transfer to determine if the write \nis part of a legal command sequence. When a legal comma nd sequence is complete the EAC will initiate the \nappropriate EA. \nWriting incorrect address or data values, or writing them in  an improper sequence, will generally result in the EAC \nreturning to its Standby state. However, such an im proper command sequence may place the device in an \nunknown state, in which case the system must write the reset command, or possibly provide a hardware reset by \ndriving the RESET# signal LOW, to return the EAC to its Standby state, ready for random read.\nThe address provided in each write may contain a bit patter n used to help identify the write as a command to the \ndevice. The upper portion of the address may also select  the sector address on which the command operation is \nto be performed. The sector address (SA) includes Amax through A16 flash address bits (system byte address signals Amax through A16). A command bit pattern is located in A10 to A0 flash address bits (system byte address signals A11 through A1).\nThe data in each write may be: a bit pattern used to help  identify the write as a command, a code that identifies \nthe command operation to be performed, or supply information needed to perform the operation. See Table 23  \nfor a listing of all commands accepted by the device. \n3.3 SSR (OTP)\nSee “SSR ASO” on page 12 for a description of the secure silicon region.

Whether it is the lowest or highest sector depends on the device ordering option (model) selected. If WP# = V\nIH, the lowest or highest addres s sector is not protected by the WP# signal but it may \nbe protected by other aspects of ASP configuration. WP# has an internal pull-up; when unconnected, WP# is at V\nIH.

When \neither bit is ‘0’ , the sector is prot ected from program and erase operations.\nThe PPB bits are protected from program and erase when the PPB lock bit is ‘0’ . There are two methods for \nmanaging the state of the PPB lock bit, pe rsistent protection and password protection. \nThe persistent protection method sets the PPB lock to ‘1’ during POR or hardware reset so that the PPB bits are \nunprotected by a device reset. There is a command to clear the PPB lock bit to ‘0’ to protect the PPB bits. There is no command in the persistent protection method to se t the PPB lock bit therefore th e PPB lock bit will remain \nat ‘0’ until the next power-off or hardware reset. The pe rsistent protection method allows boot code the option \nof changing sector protection by programming or erasin g the PPB, then protecting the PPB from further change \nfor the remainder of normal system operation by clearing  the PPB lock bit. This is sometimes called boot-code \ncontrolled sector protection.\nThe password method clears the PPB lock bit to ‘0’ during POR or ha rdware reset to protect the PPB. A 64-bit \npassword may be permanently programmed and hidden fo r the password method. A command can be used to \nprovide a password for comparison with the hidden password. If the password matches the PPB lock bit is set to ‘1’ to unprotect the PPB. A command can be used to clear the PPB Lock bit to ‘0’ .\nThe selection of the PPB lock manageme nt method is made by programming OTP bits in the lock register so as \nto permanently select the method used.\nThe lock register also contains OTP bits, for protecting the SSR.\nThe PPB bits are erased so that all main flash array se ctors are unprotected when shipped from Infineon. The SSR \ncan be factory protected or left unprotected de pending on the ordering option (model) ordered.\n3.4.3 PPB lock\nThe PPB lock is a volatile bit for protecting all PPB bits. Wh en cleared to ‘0’ , it locks all PPBs and when set to ‘1’ , \nit allows the PPBs to be changed. There is only one PPB lock bit per device.\nThe PPB lock command is used to clear the bit to ‘0’ . The PPB lock bit must be cleared to ‘0’ only after all the PPBs \nare configured to the desired settings.\nIn persistent protection mode, the PPB lock is set to ‘1’ during POR or a hardware reset. When cleared, no software \ncommand sequence can set the PPB lock, only another hardware reset or power-up can set the PPB lock bit. \nIn the password protection mode, the PPB lock is cleared to ‘0’ during POR or a hardware reset. The PPB lock can \nonly set to ‘1’ by the Password Unlock command sequence. The PPB lock can be cleared by the PPB Lock Bit Clear \ncommand.\n3.4.4 Persistent protection bits (PPB)\nThe PPB’s are located in a separate non-volatile flash array.  One of the PPB bits is assigned to each sector. When \na PPB is ‘0’ , its related sector is protected from program and erase operations. The PPB are programmed individually but must be erased as a group, similar to the way individual words may be programmed in the main array but an entire sector must be erased at the same  time. Pre-programming and verification prior to erasure \nare handled by the EAC.\nProgramming a PPB bit requires the typical word prog ramming time. During a PPB bit programming operation \nor PPB bit erasing, data polling status DQ6 Toggle Bit I will toggle until the operation is complete. Erasing all the \nPPBs requires typical sector erase time. \nIf the PPB lock is ‘0’ , the PPB program or erase comman ds do not execute and time-out without programming or \nerasing the PPB.\nThe protection state of a PPB for a given sector can be verified by executing a PPB Status Read command when \nentered in the PPB ASO.\nDatasheet 19 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nData protection\n3.4.5 Dynamic protection bits (DYB)\nDYB’s are volatile and unique for each sector and can be individually modified. DYB’s only control protection for \nsectors that have their PPBs erased. By issuing the DYB Set or Clear command sequences, the DYB are set to ‘0’ \nor cleared to ‘1’ , thus placing each sector in the protected or unprotected state respectively, if the PPB for that sector is ‘1’ . This feature allows software to easily protect sectors against inadvertent changes, yet does not \nprevent the easy removal of protection when changes are needed. \nThe DYB can be set to ‘0’ or cleared to ‘1’ as often as needed.\n3.4.6 Sector protection states summary\nEach sector can be in one of the following protection states:\n• Unlocked – The sector is unprotected and protection can be changed by a simple command. The protection \nstate defaults to unprotected after a power cycle or hardware reset.\n• Dynamically locked – A sector is protected and protecti on can be changed by a simple command. The protection \nstate is not saved across a power cycle or hardware reset.\n• Persistently locked – A sector is protected and protection can only be changed if the PPB lock bit is set to ‘1’ . \nThe protection state is non-volatile and saved across a power cycle or hardware reset. Changing the protection \nstate requires programming or erase of the PPB bits.\nTable 8 Sector protection states\nProtection bit valuesSector statePPB lock PPB DYB\n1 1 1 Unprotected – PPB and DYB are changeable1 1 0 Protected – PPB and DYB are changeable\n1 0 1 Protected – PPB and DYB are changeable\n1 0 0 Protected – PPB and DYB are changeable0 1 1 Unprotected – PPB not changeable, DYB is changeable\n0 1 0 Protected – PPB not changeable, DYB is changeable\n0 0 1 Protected – PPB not changeable, DYB is changeable0 0 0 Protected – PPB not changeable, DYB is changeable\nDatasheet 20 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nData protection\n3.4.7 Lock register\nThe Lock register holds the non-volatile OTP bits for co ntrolling protection of the SSR and determining the PPB \nlock bit management method (protection mode).\nThe SSR protection bits must be used with caution, as once locked, there is no procedure available for unlocking \nthe protected portion of the SSR and none of the bits in the protected SSR memory space can be modified in any way. Once the SSR area is protected, any further attempts to program in the area will fail with status indicating the area being programmed is protected. The region 0 indicato r bit is located in the lock  register at bit location \n0, region 1 in bit location 6, region 2 in bit location 9, and region 3 in bit location 10.\nAs shipped from the factory, all devices default to the persistent protection method, with all sectors unprotected, \nwhen power is applied. The device programmer or host system can then choose which sector protection method \nto use. Programming either of the following two, one- time programmable, non-volatile bits, locks the part \npermanently in that mode:\nPersistent Protection Mode Lock Bit (DQ1)Password Protection Mode Lock Bit (DQ2) If both lock bi ts are selected to be programmed at the same time, the \noperation will abort. Once the password mode lock bit is programmed, the persistent mode lock bit is permanently disabled and no changes to the protection sc heme are allowed. Similarly, if the persistent mode \nlock bit is programmed, the password mode is permanently disabled. \nIf the password mode is to be chosen, the password must be programmed prior to setting the corresponding lock \nregister bit. Setting the password protection mode lock bit (DQ2) will disable the ability to program or read the \npassword.\nThe programming time of the lock register is the same  as the typical word programming time. During a lock \nregister programming EA, data polling status DQ6 Toggle Bit I will toggle until the programming has completed. \nThe system can also determine the status of the lock re gister programming by reading the Status Register. See \n“Status Register” on page 43 for information on these status bits.\nThe user is not required to program DQ2 or DQ1, and DQ6 or DQ0 bits at the same time. This allows the user to \nlock the SSR before or after choosing the device pr otection scheme. When programming the lock bits, the \nReserved Bits must be ‘1’ (masked).Table 9 Lock register\nBit Default value Name\n15–12 1 Reserved\n11 1 SSR region 3 password protection mode lock bit\n10 1 SSR region 3 (Customer) lock bit\n9 1 SSR region 2 (Customer) lock bit80 R e s e r v e d\n71 R e s e r v e d  \n6 1 SSR region 1 (Customer) lock bit51 R e s e r v e d\n41 R e s e r v e d\n31 R e s e r v e d2 1 Password protection mode lock bit\n1 1 Persistent protection mode lock bit\n0 0 SSR region 0 (Factory) lock bit\nDatasheet 21 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nData protection\n3.4.8 Persistent protection mode\nThe persistent protection method sets the PPB lock to ‘1’ during POR or hardware reset so that the PPB bits are \nunprotected by a device reset. There is a command to clear the PPB Lock bit to ‘0’ to protect the PPB. There is no \ncommand in the persistent protection method to set the PPB lock bit to ‘1’ , therefore the PPB lock bit will remain \nat ‘0’ until the next power-off or hardware reset.\n3.4.9 Password protection mode\n3.4.9.1 PPB password protection mode\nPPB password protection mode allows an even higher leve l of security than the persistent sector protection \nmode, by requiring a 64-bit password for setting the PPB lock. In addition to this password requirement, after power-up and reset, the PPB lock is cleared to ‘0’ to ensure protection at power-up. Successful execution of the Password Unlock command by entering the entire password  sets the PPB lock to ‘1’ , allowing for sector PPB \nmodifications.\nPassword protection notes:\n• The Password Program Command is only capable of programming 0’s.\n• The password is all 1’s when shipped from Infineon. It  is located in its own memory space and is accessible \nthrough the use of the Password Program and Password Read commands.\n• All 64-bit password combinations are valid as a password.• Once the password is programmed and verified, the password mode locking bit must be set in order to prevent \nreading or modification of the password.\n• The password mode lock bit, once programmed, prevents reading the 64-bit password on the data bus and \nfurther password programming. All further read commands to the password region are disabled (data is read as 1’s). There is no means to verify what the passwo rd is after the password protection mode lock bit is \nprogrammed. Password verification is only allowed be fore selecting the password protection mode. Any \nprogram operation will fail and will report the results as a normal program failure on a locked sector.\n• The password mode lock bit is not erasable.• The exact password must be entered in order for the unlocking function to occur.\n- The addresses can be loaded in any order but all 4 words are required for a successful match to occur.- The sector addresses (Amax–A16) and word line addresses (A15–A8) are compared to ‘zero’ while the password \naddress/data are loaded. If the sector address or word li ne address don’t match then the error will be reported \nat the end of that write cycle. The St atus Register will return to the ready state with the program status bit set \nto ‘1’ and write buffer abort status bit set to ‘1’ indi cating a failed programming operation. The data polling \nstatus will remain active, with DQ7 set to the compleme nt of the DQ7 bit in the last word of the password \nunlock command, and DQ6 toggli ng. RY/BY# will remain LOW.\n- The specific address and data are compared after the Program Buffer To Flash command has been given. If \nthey don’t match to the internal set value than the St atus Register will return to the ready state with the \nprogram status bit set to ‘1’ indicating a failed progra mming operation. The data polling status will remain \nactive, with DQ7 set to the complement of the DQ7 bit in the last word of the Password Unlock command, and \nDQ6 toggling. RY/BY# will remain LOW. In this error ca se due to incorrect password, the device requires a wait \ntime of t\nPPB and a Software Reset command to clear the error prior to the Password ASO Exit command to \nproperly exit the Password ASO. Failure to do so will cause the device to remain in the Password ASO.\n• The device requires tPPB for setting the PPB lock after the valid 64-bit password is given to the device. This makes \nit take an unreasonably long time (58 million years) fo r a hacker to run through all the 64-bit combinations in \nan attempt to correctly match a password. The EA status checking methods may be used to determine when the EAC is ready to accept a new password command.\n• If the password is lost after setting the password mode  lock bit, there is no way to clear the PPB lock.\nDatasheet 22 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nRead operations\n4 Read operations\n4.1 Asynchronous read\nEach read access may be made to any location in the memory (random access).

The higher address bits are \nkept constant and only A3–A0 (A3–A1 in ×8 mode) changed to select a different word in the same page. This is an asynchronous access with data appearing on DQ15–DQ 0 (DQ7–DQ0 in ×8 mode) when CE# remains LOW, OE# \nremains LOW, and the asynchronous page access time (t\nPACC ) is satisfied. If CE# goes HIGH and returns LOW for \na subsequent access, a random read access is performed and time is required (tACC or tCE).\nDatasheet 23 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5 Embedded operations\n5.1 Embedded algorithm controller (EAC)\nThe EAC takes commands from the host system for programming and erasing the flash memory array and \nperforms all the complex operations needed to change the non-volatile memory state. This frees the host system \nfrom any need to manage the program and erase processes. \nThere are four EAC operation categories: \n• Standby (read mode)\n• Address space switching• Embedded algorithms (EA)• Advanced sector protection (ASP) management\n5.1.1 EAC standby\nIn the standby mode current consumption is greatly reduced. The EAC enters its standby mode when no \ncommand is being processed and no embedded algorithm is in progress. If the device is deselected (CE# = HIGH) \nduring an embedded algorithm, the device still draws active current until the operation is completed (ICC3). ICC4 \nin “DC characteristics” on page 79 represents the standby current sp ecification when both the host interface \nand EAC are in their Standby state.\n5.1.2 Address space switching\nWriting specific address and data se quences (command sequences) switch the memory device address space \nfrom the main flash array to one of  the address space overlays (ASO). \nEA’s operate on the information visible in the currently ac tive (entered) ASO. The system continues to have access \nto the ASO until the system issues an ASO Exit command,  performs a hardware RESET, or until power is removed \nfrom the device. An ASO Exit Command switches from an ASO back to the main flash array address space. The commands accepted when a particular ASO is entered are listed between the ASO enter and exit commands in the command definitions table. See “Command summary” on page 58 for address and data requirements for \nall command sequences.\n5.1.3 Embedded Algorithms (EA)\nChanging the non-volatile data in the memory array requ ires a complex sequence of operations that are called \nEA. The algorithms are manage d entirely by the device internal EAC. The main algorithms perform programming \nand erasing of the main array data and the ASO’s. The host system writes command codes to the flash device \naddress space. The EAC receives the commands, performs  all the necessary steps to complete the command, and \nprovides status information during the progress of an EA.\nDatasheet 24 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5.2 Program and erase summary\nFlash data bits are erased in parallel in a large group ca lled a sector. The erase operation places each data bit in \nthe sector in the logical 1 state (HIGH). Flash data bits  may be individually programmed from the erased 1 state \nto the programmed logical 0 (LOW) state. A data bit of ‘0’ cannot be programmed back to ‘1’ . A succeeding read shows that the data is still ‘0’ . Only erase operations ca n convert ‘0’ to ‘1’ . Programming the same word location \nmore than once with different 0 bits will result in th e logical AND of the previous data and the new data being \nprogrammed. The duration of program and erase operations is shown in “Embedded Algorithm Performance \ntable” on page 53.\nProgram and erase operations may be suspended. \n• An erase operation may be suspended to allow either pr ogramming or reading of another sector (not in the \nerase sector). No other erase operation ca n be started during an erase suspend. \n• A program operation may be suspended to allow reading of  another location (not in the line being programmed). \n• No other program or erase operation may be started during a suspended program operation – program or erase \ncommands will be ignored during a suspended program operation. \n• After an intervening program operation or read access is complete the suspended erase or program operation \nmay be resumed. The resume can happen at any time after the suspend, assuming the device is not in the process \nof executing another command.\n• Program and erase operations may be interrupted as often as necessary but in order for a program or erase \noperation to progress to completion there must be some  periods of time between re sume and the next suspend \ncommands greater than or equal to t\nPRS or tERS in “Embedded Algorithm Performance table” on page 53.\n• When an EA is complete, the EAC returns to the operatio n state and address space from which the EA was started \n(Erase Suspend, EAC Standby, ...).\nThe system can determine the status of a program or erase operation by reading the Status Register or using data \npolling status. Refer to “Status Register” on page 43 for information on these status bits. Refer to “Data polling \nstatus” on page 45 for more information.\nAny commands written to the device during the embedd ed program algorithm are ignored except the Program \nSuspend (x51h), Status Read command (x70h), an d Erase Suspend/Program Suspend command (xB0h).\nAny commands written to the device during the embedded  erase algorithm are ignored except Status Read (x70h) \nand Erase Suspend/Program Suspend command (xB0h). \nA hardware reset immediately terminates any in progress program/erase operation and returns to read mode \nafter tRPH time. The terminated operation should be reinitiated once the device has returned to the idle state, to \nensure data integrity.\nFor performance and reliability reasons reading and progra mming is internally done on full 32-byte pages. ICC3 \nin “DC characteristics” on page 79 represents the active current specification for a write (EA) operation.\nDatasheet 25 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5.2.1 Program granularity\nThe S29GL-T supports two methods of programming, word  or write buffer programming. Each Page can be \nprogrammed by either method. Pages programmed by different methods may be mixed within a line for the industrial temperature version (–40°C to +85°C). For the industrial plus version (– 40°C to +105°C) and extended \nversion (–40°C to +125°C) the device wi ll only support one programming operat ion on each 32-byte page between \nerase operations and Single Word Programming command is not supported.\nWord programming examines the data word supplied by the command and progra ms 0’s in the addressed \nmemory array word to match the 0’s in the command data word.\nWrite buffer programming examines th e write buffer and programs 0’s in the addressed memory array pages to \nmatch the 0’s in the write buffer. The writ e buffer does not need to be completely filled with data. It is allowed to \nprogram as little as a single bit, several bits, a single word , a few words, a page, multiple pages, or the entire buffer \nas one programming operation. Use of the write buffer me thod reduces host system overhead in writing program \ncommands and reduces memory device internal overhead  in programming operations to make write buffer \nprogramming more efficient and thus faster than prog ramming individual words with the Word Programming \ncommand.\n5.2.2 Incremental programming\nThe same word location may be programmed more than on ce, by either the word or write buffer programming \nmethods, to incrementally change 1’s to 0’s. Note that more than one programming operation on the same page will disable ECC for that page.\n5.3 Automatic ECC\n5.3.1 ECC overview\nThe automatic ECC feature works transparently with normal  program, erase, and read operations. As the device \ntransfers each page of data from the write buffer to th e memory array, internal ECC logic programs ECC code for \nthe page into a portion of the memory array that is not visible to the host system. The device evaluates the page \ndata and the ECC code during each initial page access. If  needed, the internal ECC logic will correct a one bit error \nduring the initial access.\nProgramming more than once to a particular page will disable the ECC function for that page. The ECC function \nwill remain disabled for that page until the next time th e host system erases the sector containing that page. The \nhost system may read data stored in that page foll owing multiple programming operations; however, ECC is \ndisabled and an error in that page will not be detected or corrected.\n5.3.2 Program and erase summary\nFor performance and reliability reasons, reading and pr ogramming operations are performed on full 32-byte \npages in parallel. The device provides ECC on each page by adding an ECC code to each page when first programmed. The ECC code is automatic and transparent to the host system.\nDatasheet 26 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5.3.3 ECC implementation\nEach 32-byte page in the main flash array, as well as each 32-byte OTP region, features an associated ECC code. \nInternal ECC logic is able to detect and correct any sing le bit error found in a page, or the associated ECC code, \nduring a read access.\nThe first write buffer program operation applied to a pa ge programs the ECC code for that page. Subsequent \nprogramming operations, that occur more than once, on a particular page disable the ECC function for that page. This allows bit or word programming; however, note th at multiple programming operations to the same page \nwill disable the ECC function on the page where incr emental programming occurs. An erase of the sector \ncontaining a page with ECC disabled will re-enable the ECC function for that page.\nThe ECC function is automatic and transparent to the user. The transparency of the automatic ECC function \nenhances data integrity for typical programming operations  that write data once to each page. The ECC function \nalso facilitates software compatibility to previous genera tions of GL family products  by allowing single word \nprogramming and bit walking where the same page or word is programmed more than once. When a page has automatic ECC disabled, the ECC function will not detect or correct an error on a data read from that page.\n5.3.4 Word programming\nWord programming programs a single word anywhere in  the main flash memory array. Programming multiple \nwords in the same 32-byte page disables automatic ECC pr otection on that page. A sector erase of the sector \ncontaining that page will re-enable automatic ECC foll owing multiple word programming operations on that \npage.\n5.3.5 Write buffer programming\nEach write buffer program operation allows for programmi ng of 1 bit up to 512 bytes. A 32-byte Page is the \nsmallest program granularity that features automatic ECC protection. Programming the same page more than once will disable the automatic ECC function on th at page. Infineon recommends that a write buffer \nprogramming operation program multiple pages in an oper ation and write each page only once. This keeps the \nautomatic ECC protection enabled on each page. For the ve ry best performance, program in full Lines of 512 bytes \naligned on 512-byte boundaries.\nDatasheet 27 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5.4 Command set\n5.4.1 Program methods5.4.1.1 Word programming\nWord programming is used to program a single word anywhere in the main flash memory array.\nThe Word Programming command is a four-write-cycle sequence. The program command sequence is initiated \nby writing two unlock write cycles, followed by the pr ogram set up command. The program address and data are \nwritten next, which in turn initiate the embedded word pr ogram algorithm. The system is not required to provide \nfurther controls or timing. The device automatically generates the program pulses and verifies the programmed cell margin internally. When the embedded word progra m algorithm is complete, the EAC then returns to its \nstandby mode. \nThe system can determine the status of the program oper ation by using data polling status, reading the Status \nRegister, or monitoring the RY/BY# output. See “Status Register” on page 43 for information on these status \nbits. See “Data polling status” on page 45 for information on these status bits. See Figure 3  for a diagram of the \nword programming operation.\nAny commands other than program suspend written to the device during the embedded program algorithm are \nignored. Note that a hardware reset (RESET# = V\nIL) immediately terminates the programming operation and \nreturns the device to read mode after tRPH time. To ensure data integrity, the Program command sequence \nshould be reinitiated once the device has completed the hardware reset operation.\nA modified version of the Word Programming command, wi thout unlock write cycles, is used for programming \nwhen entered into the lock register, password, and PPB ASOs or the unlock bypass mode. The same command is \nused to change volatile bits when entered in to the PPB lock, and DYB ASOs. See Table 23  for program command \nsequences.\nFigure 3 Word program operationSTART\nWrite Program Command\nSequence\nData Poll from System\nVerify Word?\nLast Addresss?

Programming operations of \nless than a full 512 bytes may start on any word boundary bu t may not cross a line boundary. At the start of a write \nbuffer programming operation all bit locations in the bu ffer are all 1’s (FFFFh word s) thus any locations not \nloaded will retain the existing data. See “Product overview” on page 6 for information on address map. \nWrite buffer programming allows up to 512 bytes to be programmed in one operation. It is possible to program \nfrom 1 bit up to 512 bytes in each write buffer programming operation. It is recommended that a multiple of pages \nbe written and each page written only once. For the very best performance, programming should be done in full lines of 512 bytes aligned on 512-byte boundaries.\nWrite buffer programming is supported only  in the main flash array or the SSR ASO.\nThe write buffer programming operation is initiated by firs t writing two unlock cycles. Th is is followed by a third \nwrite cycle of the Write to Buffer command with the sector  address (SA), in which programming is to occur. Next, \nthe system writes the number of word  locations minus 1. This tells the de vice how many write buffer addresses \nare loaded with data and therefore when to expect th e Program Buffer to flash confirm command. The sector \naddress must match in the Write to Buffer command and the Write Word Count command. The sector to be \nprogrammed must be unlocked (unprotected).\nThe system then writes the starting address / data combin ation. This starting address is the first address / data \npair to be programmed, and selects the write-buffer-line address. The sector address must match the write to \nbuffer sector address or the operation will abort and goes to the abort state.  All subsequent address / data pairs \nmust be in sequential order. All write buffer addresses must be within the sa me line. If the system attempts to \nload data outside this range, the operatio n will abort and go to the abort state. \nThe counter decrements for each data load operation. Note that while counting down the data writes, every write \nis considered to be data being loaded into the writ e buffer. No commands are possible during the write buffer \nloading period. The only way to stop loading the write buffer is to write with an address that is outside the line of \nthe programming operation. This invalid address wi ll immediately abort the Write to Buffer command.\nOnce the specified number of write bu ffer locations has been loaded, the system must then write the Program \nBuffer to Flash command at the sector address. The de vice then goes busy. The embedded program algorithm \nautomatically programs and verifies the data for the corr ect data pattern. The system is not required to provide \nany controls or timings during these oper ations. If an incorrect number of writ e buffer locations have been loaded \nthe operation will abort and goes to the abort state. Th e abort occurs when anything other than the program \nbuffer to flash is written when that command is expected at the end of the word count.\nThe write-buffer embedded programming operation ca n be suspended using the Program Suspend command. \nWhen the embedded program algorithm is complete, the EAC then returns to the EAC standby or erase suspend \nstandby state where the programming operation was started. \nThe system can determine the status of the program oper ation by using data polling status, reading the Status \nRegister, or monitoring the RY/BY# output. See “Status Register” on page 43 for information on these status \nbits. See “Data polling status” on page 45 for information on these status bits. See Figure 4  for a diagram of the \nprogramming operation.\nThe write buffer programming sequence will be aborted under the following conditions:\n• Load a word count value greater than the buffer size (255).\n• Write an address that is outside the line  provided in the Write to Buffer command.\n• The Program Buffer to Flash command is not issued after the Write Word Co unt number of data words is loaded.\nWhen any of the conditions that cause an abort of  Write Buffer command occur the abort will happen \nimmediately after the offending condition, and will indicate a program fail in the Status Register at bit location 4 \n(PSB = 1) due to write buffer abort bit location 3 (WBASB  = 1). The next successful program operation will clear \nthe failure status or a Clear Status Register  may be issued to clear the PSB status bit.\nThe write buffer programming sequence can be stoppe d by the following: Hardware reset or power cycle. \nHowever, these using either of these methods may leave the area being programmed in an intermediate state \nwith invalid or unstable data values. In this case the same area will need to be reprogrammed with the same data \nor erased to ensure data values are properly programmed or erased.\nDatasheet 29 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\nFigure 4 Write buffer programming operation with data polling statusWrite “Write to Buffer”\ncommand Sector Address\nWrite “Word Count”\nto program - 1 (WC)\nSector Address\nWrite Starting Address/Data\nWC = 0?\nABORT Write to \nBuffer Operation?Write to a different\nSector Address\nWrite to Buffer ABORTED.\nMust write “Write-to-Buffer\nABORT RESET”\ncommand sequence to\nreturn to READ mode.Write next Address/Data pair\nWC = WC - 1\nWrite Program Buffer to Flash\nConfirm, Sector Address\nRead DQ7-DQ0 with\nAddr = LAST LOADED ADDRESS\nDQ7 = Data?\nDQ5 = 1?DQ1 = 1?\nRead DQ7-DQ0 with\nAddr = LAST LOADED ADDRESS\nDQ7 = Data?\nFAIL or ABORT\n(Note 2 ) PASSNo\nYes(Note 4)No\nNo\nNoNo\nNoYesYesYesYes\nYes\n[Note 3][Note 5]\nNotes\n2.

When the Program Suspend command is written during a \nprogramming process, the device halts the programming operation within tPSL (program suspend latency) and \nupdates the status bits. Addresses are don’t-cares when writing the Program Suspend command.\nThere are two commands available for program suspen d. The legacy combined Erase / Program suspend \ncommand (B0h command code) and the separate Progra m Suspend command (51h command code). There are \nalso two commands for program resume. The legacy combined Erase / Program resume command (30h \ncommand code) and the separate Program Resume comman d (50h command code). It is recommended to use \nthe separate program suspend and resume commands fo r programming and use the legacy combined command \nonly for erase suspend and resume.\nAfter the programming operation has been suspended, th e system can read array data from any non-suspended \nLine. The Program Suspend command may also be issued  during a programming operation while an erase is \nsuspended. In this case, data may be read from an y addresses not in Erase Suspend or Program Suspend.\nAfter the Program Resume command is written, the device reverts to programming and the status bits are \nupdated. The system can determine the status of the prog ram operation by reading the Status Register or using \ndata polling. Refer to “Status Register” on page 43 for information on these status bits. Refer to “Data polling \nstatus” on page 45 for more information. \nAccesses and commands that are valid during Program Suspend are:\n• Read to any other non-erase-suspended sector• Read to any other non-program-suspended line\n• Status Read command\n•S t a t u s  R e g i s t e r  C l e a r• Exit ASO or Command Set Exit\n• Program Resume command\nThe system must write the Program Resume command to  exit the Program Suspend mode and continue the \nprogramming operation. Further writes of the Prog ram Resume command are ignored. Another Program \nSuspend command can be written after the device has resumed programming.\nProgram operations can be interrupted as often as necessary but in order for a program operation to progress to \ncompletion there must be some periods of time betw een resume and the next suspend command greater than \nor equal to t\nPRS in “Embedded algorithm controller (EAC)” on page 23.\nProgram suspend and resume is not supported while entered in an ASO.\n5.4.3 Accelerated programming\nThe device supports program operations when the system asserts VHH on the WP#/ACC or ACC pin. When \nWP#/ACC or ACC pin is lowered back to VIH or VIL the device exits the accelerated programming mode and returns \nto normal operation. The WP#/ACC is VHH tolerant but is not designed to accelerate the program functions. If the \nsystem asserts VHH on this input, the device automatically enters the unlock bypass mode. The system can then \nuse the Write Buffer Load command sequence provid ed by the unlock bypass mode. Note that if a \n‘Write-to-Buffer-Abort Reset’ is required while in un lock bypass mode, the full 3-cy cle RESET command sequence \nmust be used to reset the device. Removing VHH from the ACC input, upon completion of the embedded program \noperation, returns the device to normal operation.  Note that the WP#/ACC pin must not be at VHH for operations \nother than accelerated programming, or device damage may result. WP# contains an internal pull-up; when unconnected, WP# is at V\nIH. Accelerated programming is supported at room temperature only.\n• Sectors must be unlocked prior to raising WP#/ACC to VHH.\n• It is recommended that WP#/ACC apply VHH after power-up sequence is completed. In addition, it is \nrecommended that WP#/ACC apply from VHH to VIH/VIL before powering down VCC/VIO.\nDatasheet 33 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5.4.4 Unlock bypass\nThis device features an unlock bypass mode to facilitate shorter programming commands. Once the device \nenters the unlock bypass mode, only two write cycles are required to program data, instead of the normal four cycles. The device will also support the Write to Buff er command and will only require four+ write cycles.\nThis mode dispenses with the initial two unlock cycles  required in the standard program command sequence, \nresulting in faster total programming time. The “Command summary” on page 58  shows the requirements for \nthe unlock bypass command sequences.\nDuring the unlock bypass mode, only the Read, Program, Write Buffer Programming, Write-to-Buffer-Abort Reset, \nStatus Register Read, Status Register Clear, Soft Reset, Unlock Bypass Sector Erase, Unlock Bypass Chip Erase, Unlock Erase Suspend/Resume, Unlock Bypass Suspend/ Resume, and Unlock Bypass Reset commands are valid. \nTo exit the unlock bypass mode, the system must issu e the two-cycle unlock bypa ss reset command sequence. \nThe first cycle address is ‘don’t care’ and the data 90 h. The second cycle need only contain the data 00h.

The EES command can be used to detect er ase operations failed due to loss of power, reset, or \nfailure during the erase operation.\nTo initiate a EES on a sector, write 35h to address 555h  in the sector, while the EAC is in the standby state.\nThe EES command may not be written while the device is actively programming or erasing or suspended.\nThe EES command does not allow for read s to the array during the operation.\nUse the Status Register or polling method (only DQ6 toggl es) to determine if the device is busy or completed. \nOnce completed use the Status Register read to confirm if the sector is trust worthy or not. Bit 5 of the Status \nRegister (SR[5]) will be cleared to ‘0’ , if the sector is tr ust worthy. If the sector is no t trust worthy than SR[5] will \nbe set to ‘1’ , RD/BY# will stay LOW, and either a Software Reset / ASO Exit command or a Status Register Clear command is required to return the device to the Standby State.\nOnce the EES is completed, the EAC will return to the Standby State.\nThe EES command requires t\nEES to complete and update the erase status in SR.

The Bl ank Check command does not allow for read s to the array during the Blank Check. \nReads to the array while this command is executing will return polling data.\nTo initiate a Blank Check on a sector, write 33h to addre ss 555h in the sector, while the EAC is in the Standby state.\nThe Blank Check command may not be written while the devi ce is actively programming or erasing or suspended. \nUse the Status Register or polling meth od (equivalent to an embedded erase op eration) to determine if the device \nis busy or completed. Once completed the Status Regist er and the polling method wi ll display if the sector is \nblank (equivalent to a successful erase operation) or if the sector is not erased. Bit 5 of the Status Register (SR[5]) \nwill be cleared to ‘0’ if the sector is blank. If the sector is not blank than SR[5] will be set to ‘1’ , RD/BY# will stay \nLOW, and either a Software Reset / ASO Exit command or a Status Register Clear command is required to return \nthe device to the Standby State.\nAs soon as any bit is found to not be erased, the de vice will halt the operation and report the results.\nOnce the Blank Check is completed, the EAC will return to the Standby State.\n5.4.7 Erase methods\n5.4.7.1 Chip erase\nThe chip erase function erases the en tire main flash memory array. The device does not require the system to \npre-program prior to erase. The embedded erase algori thm automatically programs and verifies the entire \nmemory for an all 0 data pattern prior to electrical eras e. After a successful chip eras e, all locations within the \ndevice contain FFFFh. The system is not required to pr ovide any controls or timings during these operations. The \nchip erase command sequence is initiated by writing two unlock cycles, followed by a set up command. Two \nadditional unlock write cycles are then followed by  the chip erase command, which in turn invokes the \nembedded erase algorithm. When WE # goes HIGH, at the end of the 6th cycle, the RY/BY# goes LOW.\nWhen the embedded erase algorithm is complete, the EA C returns to the Standby state. Note that while the \nembedded erase operation is in progress, the system can not read data from the device. The system can \ndetermine the status of the erase operation by reading the RY/BY#, Status Register or using data polling. Refer to \n“Ready/Busy# (RY/BY#)” on page 70 for information on RY/BY#. Refer to “Status Register” on page 43 for \ninformation on these status bits. Refer to “Data polling status” on page 45 for more information.\nOnce the chip erase operation has begun, only a Status Read, Hardware RESET or Power cycle are valid. All other \ncommands are ignored. However, a Hardware Reset or Power Cycle immediately terminates the erase operation and returns to read mode after t\nRPH time. If a chip erase operation is terminated, the Chip Erase command \nsequence must be reinitiated once the device has re turned to the idle state to ensure data integrity.\nSee Table 18 , “Asynchronous Write operations” on page 96 and “Alternate CE# Controlled Write \noperations” on page 104 for parameters and timing diagrams.\nSectors protected by the ASP DYB an d PPB bits will not be erased. See “Advanced sector protection (ASP)” on \npage 17. If a sector is protected during chip erase, chip erase will skip the pr otected sector and continue with next \nsector erase. The status register erase status bit and se ctor lock bit are not set to ‘1’ by a failed erase on a \nprotected sector.\nDatasheet 36 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5.4.7.2 Sector erase\nThe sector erase function erases one sector in the memo ry array. The device does not require the system to \npre-program prior to erase. The embedded erase algorithm automatically programs and verifies the entire sector \nfor an all 0 data pattern prior to electrical erase. After a successful sector erase, al l locations within the erased \nsector contain FFFFh. The system is not required to prov ide any controls or timings du ring these operations. The \nsector erase command sequence is initiated by writing two unlock cycles, followed by a set up command. Two \nadditional unlock write cycles are then followed by the ad dress of the sector to be erased, and the sector erase \ncommand. When WE# goes HIGH, at the end of the 6th cycle, the RY/BY# goes LOW.\nAfter the command sequence is written, a sector erase time-out of tSEA occurs. During the time-out period, \nadditional sector addresses and sector erase command s may be written. Invalid commands will be ignored \nduring the time-out period. Loading the sector erase buff er may be done in any sequence, and the number of \nsectors may be from one sector to a ll sectors. The time between these addi tional cycles must be less than tSEA, \notherwise erasure may begin. Any sector erase address and command following the exceeded time-out may or \nmay not be accepted. It is recommended that processor interrupts be disabled during this time to ensure all commands are accepted. The interrupts can be re-enabled after the last Sector Erase command is written. Note \nthat the secured silicon sector, autoselect, and CFI functions are unavailable when an erase operation in is progress. The system must rewrite the command sequence and any additional addresses and commands.\nThe system can determine the status of the erase operatio n by reading the RY/BY#, Status Register or using data \npolling. Refer to “Ready/Busy# (RY/BY#)” on page 70 for information on RY/BY#. Refer to “Status Register” on \npage 43 for information on these status bits. Refer to “Data polling status” on page 45 for more information. \nOnce the sector erase operation has begun, the Status Register Read and Erase Susp end commands are valid. All \nother commands are ignored. However, note that a hardware reset immediately terminates the erase operation and returns to read mode after t\nRPH time. If a sector erase operation is terminated, the sector erase command \nsequence must be reinitiated once the device has reset operation to ensure data integrity. \nSector(s) protected by the ASP DYB and PPB bits or password protection will not be erased. See “Advanced \nsector protection (ASP)” on page 17. If a sector is protected during multi-sector erase, sector erase will skip the \nprotected sector and continue with next sector erase. The status register erase status bit and sector lock bit are \nnot set to ‘1’ by a failed erase on a protected sector. See “Embedded algorithm controller (EAC)” on page 23 \nfor parameters and timing diagrams. Sectors protected by the ASP DYB and PPB bits will not be erased. See “Advanced sector protection (ASP)” on page 17.\nDatasheet 37 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\nFigure 6 Sector erase operation[8]NoWrite Unlock Cycles (x16):\nAddress 555h, Data AAhAddress 2AAh, Data 55h\nWrite Sector Erase Cycles (x16):\nAddress 555h, Data 80h\nAddress 555h, Data AAh\n Address 2AAh, Data 55h\nSector Address, Data 30h\nWrite Additional \nSector Addresses \nFAIL.

This command is  valid only during sector erase or program operation. \nThe Erase Suspend command is ignored if wr itten during the chip erase operation. \nWhen the Erase Suspend command is written during the se ctor erase operation, the device requires a maximum \nof tESL (erase suspend latency) to suspend the erase operation and update the status bits.\nAfter the erase operation has been suspended, the part  enters the erase-suspend mode. The system can read \ndata from or program data to the main flash array. Reading at any address with in erase-suspended sectors \nproduces undetermined data. The system can determine if a sector is actively erasing or is erase-suspended by \nreading the Status Register or using data polling. Refer to “Status Register” on page 43 for information on these \nstatus bits. Refer to “Data polling status” on page 45 for more information.\nAfter an erase-suspended program operation is complete, the EAC returns to the erase-suspend state. The system \ncan determine the status of the program operation by reading the Status Register, just as in the standard program operation. \nIf a program failure occurs during erase suspend the Status  Register Clear or Soft Reset commands will return the \ndevice to the erase suspended state. Erase will need to be resumed and completed before again trying to program the memory array.\nAccesses and commands that are valid during Erase Suspend are:\n• Read to any other non-suspended sector\n• Program to any other non-suspended sector\n• Status Register Read•S t a t u s  R e g i s t e r  C l e a r\n• Erase Resume command \nTo resume the sector erase operation, the system must write the Erase Resume command. The device will revert \nto erasing and the status bits will be updated. Further writes of the Resume command are ignored. Another Erase Suspend command can be written after the chip has resumed erasing.\nErase suspend and resume is not su pported while entered in an ASO.\nDatasheet 39 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5.4.9 ASO Entry and Exit\n5.4.9.1 ID-CFI ASO\nThe system can access the ID-CFI ASO by issuing the ID -CFI Entry command sequence during read mode. See the \ndetail description Table 25 .\nThe ID-CFI ASO allows the following activities:\n• Read ID-CFI ASO, using the same SA as used in the entry command.• Read Sector Protection State at Sector Address (SA) + 2h. Location 2h provides volatile information on the \ncurrent state of sector protection for the sector addresse d. Bit 0 of the word at location 2h shows the logical \nNAND of the PPB and DYB bits related to the addressed sect or such that if the sector is protected by either the \nPPB = 0 or the DYB = 0 bit for that sector the state shown is protected. (1 = Sector protected, 0 = Sector unprotected.)\n•A S O  E x i t .\nThe following is a C source code example of using the CFI Entry and Exit functions.

When the \nStatus Register read command is issued, the current status is  captured (by the rising edge of WE#) into the register \nand the ASO is entered. The Status Register content appear s on all word locations. The first read access exits the \nStatus Register ASO (with the rising edge of CE# or OE #) and returns to the address space map in use when the \nStatus Register read command was issued. Write commands will not exit the Status Register ASO state.\n5.4.9.3 Secure Silicon Region ASO\nThe system can access the Secure Silicon Region by issu ing the Secure Silicon Region Entry command sequence \nduring Read Mode. This entry command uses the sector address (SA) in the command to determine which sector will be overlaid.\nThe Secure Silicon Region ASO a llows the following activities:\n• Read Secure Silicon Regions.\n• Program the customer Secure Silicon Region is allowe d using the Word or Write Buffer Programming commands. \nThe Unlock Bypass commands and using ACC is not allowed.\n• ASO Exit using legacy Secure Silicon Exit command for backward software compatibility.\n• ASO Exit using the common exit command for all ASO - alternative for a consistent exit method.\n• The recommended procedure for using the SSR region 3 read password mode is as follows:• Program the data you want in SSR region 3.\n• Clear lock register bit 10 to ‘0’ , which disable further program operations.\n• Program the SSR region 3 password.• Clear lock register bit 11 to ‘0’ , which will enable the SSR region 3 password feature which requires that a \npassword be applied before reading SSR region 3 is allowed.\nDatasheet 40 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5.4.9.4 Lock Register ASO\nThe system can access the lock register by issuing the Lock Register entry command sequence during read mode. \nThis entry command does not use a sector address from the entry command.

This feature is an extension of the legacy unlock cycle sequence used at the beginning of \nseveral commands. The unlock sequence  is two writes with alternating ones and zeros pattern on the lower \nportion of the address and data lines with the pattern in verted between the first and second write.

Prev ious generations of the S 29GL flash family used the \nmethods called data polling and Ready/Busy# (RY/BY#) Si gnal. These methods are still supported by the S29GL-T \nfamily. One additional method is reading the Status Register.\n5.5.1 Status Register\nThe status of program and erase operations is provided by a single 16-bit Status Register. The Status Register \nRead command is written followed by a read access of the Status Register information. When the Status Register \nread command is issued, the current status is captured (b y the rising edge of WE#) in to the register and the ASO \nis entered. The contents of the Status Register is aliased (overlaid) in the full memory address space. Valid read \n(CE# and OE# LOW) access in the Status Register ASO exits the ASO (with the rising edge of CE# or OE# for \ntCEPH /tOEPH  time) and returns to the address space map in use when the Status Register Read command was \nissued. While in ×8 mode the full Status  Register can be read (both the upper byte and lower byte) with one Status \nRegister entry by keeping CE# and OE# LOW and having a transition on A1. Write operations are ignored and the \ndevice will stay in Status Register ASO.The Status Register contains bits related to the results – success or failure – of the most recently completed embedded algorithms (EA): \n• Erase status (bit 5), •P r o g r a m  s t a t u s  ( b i t  4 ) ,  \n• Write buffer abort (bit 3),\n• Sector locked status (bit 1), • Continuity Check Pattern Detected (bit 0).\nand, bits related to the current state of any in process EA: \n•D e v i c e  b u s y  ( b i t  7 ) ,  • Erase suspended (bit 6), \n• Program suspended (bit 2)\nThe current state bits indicate whether an EA  is in process, suspended, or completed.\nThe upper 8 bits (bits 15:8) are reserved. These have un defined HIGH or LOW value that can change from one \nstatus read to another. These bits should be treated as  don’t care and ignored by any software reading status.\nThe Soft Reset Command will clear to 0 bits [5, 4, 1, 0] of the Status Register if Status Register bit 3 = 0.

A single word of status inform ation is aliased in all locations of th e device address space. In the status \nword there are several bits to determine the status of an EA. These are referred to as DQ bits as they appear on \nthe data bus during a read access while an EA is in progress. DQ bits 15 to 8, DQ4, and DQ0 are reserved and provide undefined data. Status monitoring software must mask the reserved bits and treat them as don’t care. \nIn ×8 mode A1 is ignored when performing Data Polling. Table 17  and the following subsections describe the \nfunctions of the remaining bits.\n5.5.2.1 DQ7: Data# polling\nThe Data# polling bit, DQ7, indicates to the host system  whether an embedded algori thm is in progress or has \ncompleted. Data# polling is valid after the rising edge of the final WE# pulse in the program or erase command \nsequence. Note that the Data# polling is valid only for the last word being programmed in the write-buffer-page \nduring write buffer programming. Reading Data# polling status on any word other than the last word to be programmed in the write-buffer-page will return false status information.\nDuring the embedded program algorithm, the device  outputs on DQ7 the complement of the data bit \nprogrammed to DQ7. This DQ7 status also applies to  programming during erase suspend. When the embedded \nprogram algorithm is complete, the device outputs th e data bit programmed to bit 7 of the last word \nprogrammed. In case of a program suspend, the device al lows only reading array data. If a program address falls \nwithin a protected sector, Data# polling on DQ7 is active for t\nDP, then the device returns to reading array data.\nDuring the Embedded Erase, Evaluate Erase Status, or Blank Check algorithms, Data# polling produces ‘0’ on \nDQ7. When the algorithm is complete, or if the device enters the erase suspend mode, Data# polling produces ‘1’ \non DQ7. This is analogous to the complement / true datum output described for the embedded program algorithm: the erase function changes all the bits in a sector to ‘1’; prior to this, the device outputs the \ncomplement or ‘0’ . The system must provide an address with in the sector selected for erasure to read valid status \ninformation on DQ7. \nAfter an erase command sequence is writ ten, if the sector selected for erasin g is protected, Data# polling on DQ7 \nis active for t\nDP, then the device returns to reading array data.\nJust prior to the completion of an embedded program or  erase operation, DQ7 may ch ange asynchronously with \nDQ6–DQ0 while Output Enable (OE#) is asserted LOW. Th at is, the device may change from providing status \ninformation to valid data on DQ7. Depending on when th e system samples the DQ7 output, it may read the status \nor valid data. Even if the device has completed the prog ram or erase operation and DQ7 has valid data, the data \noutputs on DQ6–DQ0 may be still invalid. Valid da ta on DQ7–D00 appears on successive read cycles.\nWhen the system detects DQ7 has changed from the complement to true data, it can read valid data at \nDQ15–DQ0 (DQ7–DQ0 in ×8 mode) on the following read cycles. This is beca use DQ7 may change asynchronously \nwith DQ6–DQ0 while Output Enable (OE#) is  asserted LOW. This  is illustrated in Figure 29 . Figure 17  shows the \noutputs for Data# polling on DQ7. Figure 4  shows the Data# polling algorithm use in Write Buffer Programming.\nValid DQ7 data polling status may only be read from: \n• the address of the last word loaded into the writ e buffer for a write buffer programming operation; \n• the location of a single word programming operation; \n• a location in a sector being erased, or  evaluate erase status, or blank checked;\n• or a location in any sector during chip erase. \nDatasheet 46 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\nFigure 7 Data# polling algorithm[23] START\nRead DQ7 -DQ0-\nFAILDQ7 = Data?\nNoYes\nDQ5 = 1?No\nYes\nDQ7 = Data?\nNoYes\nPA SSRead DQ7 -DQ0\nNote\n23.DQ7 should be rechecked even if DQ5 = 1 be cause DQ7 may change simultaneously with DQ5.\nDatasheet 47 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5.5.2.2 DQ6: Toggle Bit I\nToggle Bit I on DQ6 indicates whether an embedded program or erase algorithm is in progress or complete, or \nwhether the device has entered the program suspend or erase suspend mode. Toggle Bit I may be read at any \naddress, and is valid after the rising edge of the final WE# pulse in the command sequence (prior to the program \nor erase operation).\nDuring an embedded program or erase algorithm operatio n, successive read cycles to any address cause DQ6 to \ntoggle (The system may use either OE# or CE# to control the read cycles). When the operation is complete, DQ6 \nstops toggling.\nAfter an erase command sequence is written, if the sect or selected for erasing is protected, DQ6 toggles for tDP, \nthen the EAC returns to standby (Read Mode). If the se lected sector is not protected, the embedded erase \nalgorithm erases the unprotected sector.\nThe system can use DQ6 and DQ2 together to determine wh ether a sector is actively erasing or erase-suspended. \nWhen the device is actively erasing (that is, the embedded  erase algorithm is in progre ss), DQ6 toggles. When the \ndevice enters the program suspend mode or erase suspen d mode, DQ6 stops toggling. However, the system must \nalso use DQ2 to determine which sector s are erasing, or erase-suspended. Al ternatively, the system can use DQ7 \n(see “DQ7: Data# polling” on page 45).\nDQ6 also toggles during the erase-suspend-program mode, and stops toggling once the embedded program \nalgorithm is complete.\nTable 17  shows the outputs for Toggle Bit I on DQ6. Figure 8  shows the toggle bit algorithm in flowchart form, \nand the “Reading Toggle Bits DQ6/DQ2” on page 48 explains the algorithm. Figure 8  shows the toggle bit timing \ndiagrams. See also “DQ2: Toggle Bit II” on page 47.\n5.5.2.3 DQ3: Sector Erase Timer\nAfter writing a sector erase command sequence, the syst em may read DQ3 to determine whether or not erasure \nhas begun. See “Sector erase” on page 36  for more details (The sector erase timer does not apply to the chip \nerase command). If additional sectors are selected for erasure, the entire time-out also applies after each \nadditional sector erase command. When the time-out period is complete, DQ3 switches from ‘0’ to ‘1’ . If the time \nbetween additional sector erase commands from the system can be assumed to be less than tSEA, then the system \nneed not monitor DQ3. \nAfter the sector erase command is written, the system sh ould read the status of DQ7 (Data# polling) or DQ6 \n(Toggle Bit I) to ensure that the device has accepted the command sequence, and then read  DQ3. If DQ3 is ‘1’ , the \nembedded erase algorithm has begun; all further command s (except Erase Suspend) are ignored until the erase \noperation is complete. If DQ3 is ‘0’ , the device acce pts additional sector erase commands. To ensure the \ncommand has been accepted, the system software should check the status of DQ3 pr ior to and following each \nsub-sequent sector erase command. If DQ3 is high on the second status check, the last command might not have been accepted. Table 17  shows the status of DQ3 relative to the other status bits.\n5.5.2.4 DQ2: Toggle Bit II\nToggle Bit II on DQ2, when used with DQ6, indicates whethe r a particular sector is actively erasing (that is, the \nembedded erase algorithm is in progress ), or whether that sector is erase-suspended. Toggle Bit II is valid after \nthe rising edge of the final WE # pulse in the command sequence.\nDQ2 toggles when the system reads at a ddresses within the sector selected for erasure (or all sectors selected for \nerase operation during multi-sector erase). (The system may use either OE# or CE# to control the read cycles). \nBut DQ2 cannot distinguish whether the sector is actively  erasing or is erase-suspended. DQ6, by comparison, \nindicates whether the device is actively erasing, or is in  erase suspend, but cannot di stinguish if the sector is \nselected for erasure. Thus, both status bits are re quired for sector and mode information. Refer to Table 17  to \ncompare outputs for DQ2 and DQ6. Figure 7  shows the toggle bit algorithm in flowchart form, and the “Reading \nToggle Bits DQ6/DQ2” on page 48 explains the algorithm. See also Figure 8  shows the toggle bit timing diagram.\nDatasheet 48 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nEmbedded operations\n5.5.2.5 Reading Toggle Bits DQ6/DQ2\nRefer to Figure 7  for the following discussion. Whenever the system  initially begins reading toggle bit status, it \nmust read DQ7–DQ0 at least twice in a row to determine whether a toggle bit is toggling. Typically, the system \nwould note and store the value of the toggle bit after the first read. After the second read, the system would \ncompare the new value of the toggle bit with the previous value. If the toggle bit is not toggling, the device has \ncompleted the program or erases operation. The syst em can read array data on DQ15–DQ0 (DQ7–DQ0 in ×8 \nmode) on the following read cycle.\nHowever, if after the initial two read cycles, the system de termines that the toggle bit is still toggling, the system \nalso should note whether the value of DQ5 is HIGH (see “DQ5: Exceeded timing limits” on page 49). If it is, the \nsystem should then determine again whether the toggle bit is toggling, since the toggle bit may have stopped \ntoggling just as DQ5 went HIGH. If the toggle bit is no longer toggling, the device has successfully completed the \nprogram or erase operation. If it is still toggling, the device did not complete the operation successfully, and the \nsystem must write the reset command to return to reading array data. It is recommended that data read for polling purposes only be used for polling purposes. On ce toggling has stopped array data will be available on \nsubsequent reads.\nThe remaining scenario is that the system initially determin es that the toggle bit is toggling and DQ5 has not gone \nHIGH. The system may continue to monitor the toggle bit and DQ5 through successive read cycles, determining the status as described in the previous paragraph. Altern atively, it may choose to perform other system tasks. In \nthis case, the system must start at the beginning of the algorithm when it returns to determine the status of the \noperation (operation as shown in Figure 8 ).\nFigure 8 Toggle Bit program\n[24, 25] START\nRead DQ7 -DQ0 (Note 1) \nErase/Program \nOperation Not\nComplete  Toggle Bit \n= Toggle? \nYes No \nDQ5 = 1?

Under these \nconditions DQ5 produces ‘1’ . This is a failure condit ion that indicates the program or erase cycle was not \nsuccessfully completed. The system mu st issue the reset command to return the device to reading array data.\nWhen a timeout occurs, the software must send a Soft Reset or Status Register Reset command to clear the \ntimeout bit (DQ5) and to return the EAC to the initial state. In this case, it is possible that the flash will continue \nto communicate busy for up to tTOR after the reset command is sent.\n5.5.2.7 DQ1: Write-to-buffer abort\nDQ1 indicates whether a write-to-buffer operation was ab orted. Under these conditions DQ1 produces ‘1’ . The \nsystem must issue the Write-to-Buffer-Abort-Reset comma nd sequence or Status Register Clear command to \nreturn the EAC to standby (Read Mode) and the Status Register failed bits are cleared.

Depending on the error \ntype, the status reported and procedure for clearing the erro r status is different. Following is the clearing of error \nstatus: \n• If an ASO was entered before the error the device remains entered in the ASO awaiting ASO read or a command \nwrite. \n• If an erase was suspended before the error the device re turns to the erase suspended state awaiting flash array \nread or a command write. \n• Otherwise, the device will be in standby state awaiting flash array read or a command write. \n5.6.1 Embedded operation error\nIf an error occurs during an embedd ed operation (program, erase, blank ch eck, or password unlock) the device \n(EAC) remains busy.

If the BYTE# \npin is set at logic 1, the device is in word configur ation, DQ0–DQ15 are active and controlled by CE# and OE#.\nIf the BYTE# pin is set at logic 0, the device is in byte  configuration, and only data I/O pins DQ0–DQ7 are active \nand controlled by CE# and OE#. The data I/O pins DQ8–DQ 14 are tri-stated, and the DQ15 pin is used as an input \nfor the LSB (A1) address function.\nThe BYTE# pin can only be switch while the device is in standby (read mode).\nThe BYTE# pin has an internal pull-up. Though not require d in a ×16 only system, the pin should be connected to \nhigh (e.g. VIO)\n8.4 Versatile I/O feature\nThe maximum output voltage level driven by, and input levels acceptable to, the device are determined by the \nVIO power supply. This supply allows the device to drive and receive signals to and from other devices on the same \nbus having interface signal levels different from the device core voltage.\n8.5 Ready/Busy# (RY/BY#)\nRY/BY# is a dedicated, open drain output pin that indicates whether an EA, POR, or hardware reset is in progress or complete. The RY/BY# status is valid after the rising edge of the final WE# pulse in a command sequence, when \nV\nCC is above VCC minimum during POR, or after the falling edge of  RESET#. Since RY/BY# is an open drain output, \nseveral RY/BY# pins can be tied together in parallel with a pull up resistor to VIO.\nIf the output is LOW (Busy), the device is actively eras ing, programming, or resetting (This includes programming \nin the Erase Suspend mode). If the output is HIGH (Ready), the device is ready to read data (including during the erase suspend mode), or is in the standby mode. Table 17  shows the outputs for RY/BY# in each operation.\nIf EA has failed (Program/erase failure as result of max pu lses or program abort), RY/BY# will stay LOW (busy) until \nstatus register bits 4 and 5 are cleared and the reset command is issued. If EA has failed (Sector is locked), RY/BY# will return HIGH (ready). This includes erase or programming on a locked sector.\n8.6 Hardware reset\nThe RESET# input provides a hardware method of resettin g the device to standby state. When RESET# is driven \nLOW for at least a period of tRP, the device immediately: \n• terminates any operation in progress,\n•e x i t s  a n y  A S O ,\n• tristates all outputs, • resets the Status Register,\n• resets the EAC to standby state. \n• CE# is ignored for the durati on of the reset operation (t\nRPH).\n• To meet the Reset current specification (ICC5) CE# must be held HIGH.\nTo ensure data integrity, any operation that was interrup ted should be reinitiated once the device is ready to \naccept another command sequence.\nDatasheet 71 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nSignal protocols\n9 Signal protocols\nThe following sections describe the host system interfac e signal behavior and timing for the 29GL-T family flash \ndevices. \n9.1 Interface states\nTable 31  describes the required value of each interface signal for each interface state.\nLegend:\nL = VIL\nH = VIH\nX = either VIL or VIH\nL/H = rising edge\nH/L = falling edgeValid = all bus signals have stable L or H level\nModified = valid state different from a previous valid state\nAvailable = read data is internally stored  with output driver controlled by OE#Table 31 Interface states\nInterface State VCC VIO RESET# CE# OE# WE# BYTE#[97]WP#/ACC Amax–A0[92]DQ0–DQ7DQ8-DQ15\nBYTE# = VIH BYTE = VIL\nPower-Off with \nHardware Data Protection< V\nLKO\uf0a3 VCC X X X X L or H X X High-Z High-Z High-Z\nPower-On (Cold) \nReset \uf0b3 VCC min\uf0b3 VIO min\uf0a3 VCCX X X X L or H X X High-Z High-Z High-Z\nHardware \n(Warm) Reset \uf0b3 VCC min\uf0b3 VIO min\uf0a3 VCCL X X X L or H X X High-Z High-Z High-Z\nInterface \nStandby \uf0b3 VCC min\uf0b3 VIO min\uf0a3 VCCH H X X L or H H X High-Z High-Z High-Z\nAutomatic \nSleep[93, 95]\uf0b3 VCC min\uf0b3 VIO min\uf0a3 VCCHL X X L  o r  H H V a l i dOutput \nAvailableOutput AvailableDQ8–DQ14 = \nHigh-Z, \nDQ15 = A1\nRead with \nOutput \nDisable[94]\uf0b3 VCC min\uf0b3 VIO min\uf0a3 VCCHL H H\nL or HX Valid High-Z High-Z High-Z\nRandom Read \uf0b3 VCC min\uf0b3 VIO min H L L H X Valid Output Valid Output ValidDQ8–DQ14 = \nHigh-Z, \nDQ15 = A1\nPage Read \uf0b3 VCC min\uf0b3 VIO min\uf0a3 VCCHL L H L  o r  H XAmax–A4 \nValid\nA3–A0 \n(or A3–A1) \nModifiedOutput Valid Output ValidDQ8–DQ14 = \nHigh-Z, \nDQ15 = A1\nWrite \uf0b3 VCC min\uf0b3 VIO min\uf0a3 VCCH L H L L or H Note [96] Valid Input Valid Input ValidDQ8–DQ14 = \nHigh-Z, \nDQ15 = A1\nNotes\n92.Address are Amax:A0 in word mode; Amax:A1 in byte mode.93.WE# and OE# can not be at V\nIL at the same time.\n94.Read with Output Disable is a read initiated with OE# HIGH.\n95.Automatic Sleep is a read/write operation where data has been driven on the bus for an extended period, \nwithout CE# going HIGH and the device internal logi c has gone into standby mode to conserve power.\n96.If WP# = VIL, on the outermost sector remains protected.

When VCC is below VLKO, the entire memory array is protected against a program or erase operation. This \nensures that no spurious alteration of the memory co ntent can occur during power transition. During a power \nsupply transition down to power-off, VIO should remain less than or equal to VCC.\nIf VCC goes below VRST (Min) then returns above VRST (Min) to VCC minimum, the POR interface state is entered and \nthe EAC starts the cold reset embedded algorithm.\n9.3 Power Conservation modes\n9.3.1 Interface Standby\nStandby is the default, low power, state for the interface while the device is not selected by the host for data \ntransfer (CE# = HIGH). All inputs are ignored in this st ate and all outputs except RY/BY# are high impedance. \nRY/BY# is a direct output of the EAC, not controlled by the host interface.\n9.3.2 Automatic Sleep\nThe automatic sleep mode reduces device interface energy consumption to the sleep level (ICC6) following the \ncompletion of a random read access time. The device au tomatically enables this mo de when addresses remain \nstable for tACC + 30 ns. While in automatic sleep mode, output data  is latched and always available to the system. \nOutput of the data depends on the level of the OE# sign al but, the automatic sleep mode current is independent \nof the OE# signal level. Stan dard address access timings (tACC or tPACC ) provide new data when addresses are \nchanged. Refer the “DC characteristics” on page 79 for the automatic sleep mode current specification ICC6. \nAutomatic sleep helps reduce current consumption especi ally when the host system clock is slowed for power \nreduction. During slow system clock periods, read and wr ite cycles may extend many times their length versus \nwhen the system is operating at high speed. Even though CE# may be LOW throughout these extended data transfer cycles, the memory device host interface will go to the Automatic Sleep current at t\nACC + 30 ns. The device \nwill remain at the Automatic Sleep current for tASSB . Then the device will transition to the standby current level. \nThis keeps the memory at the Automatic Sleep or standby po wer level for most of the long duration data transfer \ncycles, rather than consuming full read power all the time that the memory device is selected by the host system.\nHowever, the EAC operates independent of the automatic sleep mode of the host interface and will continue to \ndraw current during an active EA. Only when both the ho st interface and EAC are in their standby states is the \nstandby level current achieved.\nDatasheet 73 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nSignal protocols\n9.4 Read\n9.4.1 Read with output disable\nWhen the CE# signal is asserted LOW, the host system memory controller begins a read or write data transfer. \nOften there is a period at the beginning of a data transfer when CE# is LOW, Address is valid, OE# is HIGH, and WE# is HIGH. During this state a read access is assumed and the random read process is started while the data outputs \nremain at high impedance. If the OE# signal goes LOW, the interface transitions to the random read state, with \ndata outputs actively driven. If the WE# signal is asserted  LOW, the interface transitions to the write state. Note, \nOE# and WE# should never be LOW at the same time to en sure no data bus contention between the host system \nand memory. \n9.4.2 Random (Asynchronous) read\nWhen the host system interface selects the memory device  by driving CE# LOW, the de vice interface leaves the \nStandby state. If WE# is HIGH when CE# goes LOW, a random read access is started. The data output depends on the address map mode and the ad dress provided at the time the read access is started. \nThe data appears on DQ15–DQ 0 (DQ7–DQ0 in ×8 mode) when CE# is LOW,  OE# is LOW, WE# remains HIGH, address \nremains stable, and the asynchronous access ti mes are satisfied. Address access time (t\nACC) is equal to the delay \nfrom stable addresses to valid output  data. The chip enable access time (tCE) is the delay from stable CE# to valid \ndata at the outputs. In order for the read data to be driven on to the data outputs the OE# signal must be LOW at least the output enable time (t\nOE) before valid data is available. \nAt the completion of the random access time from CE# active (tCE), address stable (tACC), or OE# active (tOE), \nwhichever occurs latest, the data outputs will provide va lid read data from the currently active address map \nmode. If CE# remains LOW and any of the Amax to A4 addr ess signals change to a new value, a new random read \naccess begins. If CE# remains LOW and OE# goes HIGH the interface transitions to the read with output disable \nstate. If CE# remains LOW, OE# goes HIGH, and WE# goes LO W, the interface transitions to the Write state. If CE# \nreturns HIGH, the interface goes to the Standby state. Ba ck to back accesses, in which CE# remains LOW between \naccesses, requires an address change to initiate the second access. See “Asynchronous read operations” on \npage 89.\n9.4.3 Page read\nAfter a random read access is completed, if CE# remains LOW, OE# remains LOW, the Amax to A4 address signals \nremain stable, and any of the A3 to A0 address signals change, a new access within the same page begins. In ×8 mode, when any of the A3 to A1 address signals change, a new access within the same page begins. The page read completes much faster (t\nPACC ) than a random read access.\nDatasheet 74 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nSignal protocols\n9.5 Write\n9.5.1 Asynchronous write\nWhen WE# goes LOW after CE is LOW, there is a transition fr om one of the read states to the write state. If WE# is \nLOW before CE# goes LOW, there is a transition from the Standby state directly to the write state without \nbeginning a read access. \nWhen CE# is LOW, OE# is HIGH, and WE# goes LOW, a writ e data transfer begins. Note, OE# and WE# should never \nbe LOW at the same time to ensure no data bus cont ention between the host system and memory. When the \nasynchronous write cycle timing requirements are met the WE# can go HIGH to capture the address and data \nvalues in to EAC command memory. \nAddress is captured by the falling edge of WE# or CE#, whichever occurs later. Data is captured by the rising edge \nof WE# or CE#, whichever occurs earlier.\nWhen CE# is LOW before WE# goes LOW and stays LOW after WE# goes HIGH, the access is called a WE# controlled \nwrite. When WE# is HIGH and CE# goes HIGH, there is a transition to the Standby state. If CE# remains LOW and \nWE# goes HIGH, there is a transition to  the read with output disable state. \nWhen WE# is LOW before CE# goes LOW and remains LO W after CE# goes HIGH, the access is called a CE# \ncontrolled write. A CE# controlled wr ite transitions to the Standby state.\nIf WE# is LOW before CE# goes LOW, the write transfer is  started by CE# going LOW. If WE# is LOW after CE# goes \nHIGH, the address and data are captured by the rising edge  of CE#. These cases are referred to as CE# controlled \nwrite state transitions.\nWrite followed by read accesses, in which CE# remains LOW between accesses, requires an address change to \ninitiate the following read access.\nBack to back accesses, in which CE# remains LOW between accesses, requires an address change to initiate the \nsecond access.\nThe EAC command memory array is not readable by the host system and has no AS O. The EAC examines the \naddress and data in each write transfer to determine if the write is part of a legal command sequence. When a legal command sequence is complete the EAC will initiate the appropriate EA.\n9.5.2 Write Pulse “Glitch” protection\nNoise pulses of less than 5 ns (typical) on WE# will not initiate a write cycle.\n9.5.3 Logical inhibit\nWrite cycles are inhibite d by holding OE# at VIL, or CE# at VIH, or WE# at VIH. To initiate a write cycle, CE# and WE# \nmust be LOW (VIL) while OE# is HIGH (VIH).\nDatasheet 75 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nElectrical specifications\n10 Electrical specifications\n10.1 Absolute maximum ratings\n10.2 Thermal resistance\n10.3 Latchup characteristics\nThis product complies with JEDEC standard JESD78C latch-up testing requirements.Table 32 Absolute maximum ratings\nStorage temperature plastic packages –65°C to +150°C\nAmbient temperature with power applied –65°C to +125°CVoltage with respect to ground\nAll pins other than RESET#\n[98]–0.5 V to (VIO + 0.5 V)\nRESET#[98]–0.5 V to (VCC + 0.5 V)\nOutput short circuit current[99]100 mA\nVCC –0.5 V to +4.0 V\nVIO –0.5 V to +4.0 V\nACC –0.5 V to +12.5 V\nTable 33 Thermal resistance\nParameter Description Test condition Device TS056 LAE064 LAA064 VBU056 Unit\nTheta JAThermal resistance \n(Junction to ambient)Test conditions \nfollow standard test \nmethods and procedures for \nmeasuring thermal \nimpedance in accordance with \nEIA/JESD51. with Still \nAir (0 m/s).1G 43.5 30 24 30.5 °C/W\n512M 45 32 26 33 °C/W\nTheta JBThermal resistance \n(Junction to board)1G 40.5 8.4 10.5 8.3 °C/W\n512M 14 12.4 11.8 10.4 °C/W\nTheta JCThermal resistance \n(Junction to case)1G 20 7.5 6.7 8.1 °C/W\n512M 19.5 10.1 7.3 10 °C/W\nNotes\n98.Minimum DC voltage on input or I/O pins is –0.5 V.

During tVCS the device is performing power on reset \noperations.\nDuring power-down or voltage drops below VCC Lockout maximum (VLKO), the VCC and VIO voltages must drop \nbelow VCC Reset (VRST) minimum for a period of tPD for the part to initialize correctly when VCC and VIO again rise \nto their operating ranges. See Figure 10 . If during a voltage drop the VCC stays above VLKO maximum the part will \nstay initialized and will  work correctly when VCC is again above VCC minimum.   If the part locks up from improper \ninitialization, a hardware reset can be used to initialize the part correctly.\nNormal precautions must be taken for supply decoupling to stabilize the VCC and VIO power supplies. Each device \nin a system should have the VCC and VIO power supplies decoupled by a suitable capacitor close to the package \nconnections (this capacitor is generally on th e order of 0.1 µF).

If RE SET is asserted during POR, the later of tRPH, tVIOS , or tVCS will \ndetermine when CE# may go LOW. If RESET# remains LOW after tVIOS , or tVCS is satisfied, tRPH is measured \nfrom the end of tVIOS , or tVCS. RESET must also be HIGH tRH before CE# goes LOW. \n139.VCC \uf0b3 VIO – 200 mV during power-up.\n140.VCC and VIO ramp rate can be non-linear.\n141.Sum of tRP and tRH must be equal to or greater than tRPH.\nDatasheet 87 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nTiming specifications\n11.3.1 Power-on (Cold) reset (POR)\nDuring the rise of power supplies the VIO supply voltage must remain less than or equal to the VCC supply voltage. \nVIH also must remain less than or equal to the VIO supply.\nThe cold reset EA requires a relatively long, hundreds of µs, period (tVCS) to load all of the EAC algorithms and \ndefault state from non-volatile memory . During the cold reset period all co ntrol signals including CE# and RESET# \nare ignored. If CE# is LOW during tVCS the device may draw higher th an normal POR current during tVCS but the \nlevel of CE# will not affect the cold reset EA. RESET# may be HIGH or LOW during tVCS. If RESET# is LOW during \ntVCS it may remain LOW at the end of tVCS to hold the device in the hardware reset state. If RESET# is HIGH at the \nend of tVCS the device will go to the Standby state.\nWhen power is first applied, with supply voltage below VRST then rising to reach operating range minimum, \ninternal device configuration and warm reset activities ar e initiated. CE# is ignored for the duration of the POR \noperation (tVCS or tVIOS ). RESET# LOW during this POR period is opti onal. If RESET# is driven LOW during POR it \nmust satisfy the hardware reset parameters tRP and tRPH. In which case the reset operations will be completed at \nthe later of tVCS or tVIOS  or tRPH. A CE#, OE#, or Address transition will init iate the 1st read operation. If CE# is held \nLOW during POR than the current address will be automatically read.\nDuring cold reset the device will draw ICC7 current.\nFigure 15 Power-up diagramVCC\nVIO\nRESET#\nCE# tRH  tVIOS  tVCS \n tCEH\nDatasheet 88 002-00247 Rev. *M\n2022-07-251 Gb (128 MB)/512 Mb (64 MB) GL-T MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nTiming specifications\n11.3.2 Hardware (Warm) reset\nDuring hardware reset (tRPH) the device will draw ICC5 current.\nWhen RESET# continues to be held at VSS, the device draws CMOS standby current (ICC4). If RESET# is held at VIL, \nbut not at VSS, the standby current is greater.\nIf a cold reset has not been completed by the device when RESET# is asserted LOW after tVCS, the Cold Reset# EA \nwill be performed instead of the Warm RESET#, requiring tVCS time to complete. See Figure 16 .\nAfter the device has completed POR and entered the Standby state, any later transition to the hardware reset \nstate will initiate the warm reset EA. A Warm Reset is mu ch shorter than a cold reset, taking tens of µs (tRPH) to \ncomplete. During the warm reset EA, any in progress EA is  stopped and the EAC is returned to its POR state without \nreloading EAC algorithms from non-volatile memory. After the warm reset EA completes, the interface will remain \nin the hardware reset state if RESET# remains LOW. When  RESET# returns HIGH the interface will transit to the \nStandby state. If RESET# is HIGH at the end of the warm reset EA, the interface will di rectly transit to the Standby \nstate. If CE# is held LOW during warm reset than  the current address will be automatically read.\nIf POR has not been properly completed by the end of tVCS, a later transition to the hardware reset state will cause \na transition to the power-on-reset interface state and in itiate the cold reset EA. This ensures the device can \ncomplete a cold reset even if some aspect of the system  power-on voltage ramp-up causes the POR to not initiate \nor complete correctly. The RY/BY# pin is LOW during cold or  warm reset as an indication that the device is busy \nperforming reset operations. \nHardware reset is initiated by the RESET# signal going to VIL.\nFigure 16
