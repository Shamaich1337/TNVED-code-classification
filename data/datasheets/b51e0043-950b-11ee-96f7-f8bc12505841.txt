General description\nThe 74LVC08A is a quad 2-input AND gate. Inputs can be driven from either 3.3 V or 5 V devices.\nThis feature allows the use of these devices as translators in mixed 3.3 V and 5 V applications.\nSchmitt-trigger action at all inputs makes the circuit tolerant of slower input rise and fall times.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Overvoltage tolerant inputs to 5.5 V\n•Wide supply voltage range from 1.2 V to 3.6 V\n•CMOS low power consumption\n•Direct interface with TTL levels\n•Complies with JEDEC standard:\n•JESD8-7A (1.65 V to 1.95 V)\n•JESD8-5A (2.3 V to 2.7 V)\n•JESD8-C/JESD36 (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM: ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-001 class 2 exceeds 2000 V\n•CDM: ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-002 class C3 exceeds 1000 V\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\n3.

### Component Summary: 74LVC08APW,118

**General Description:**
The 74LVC08A is a quad 2-input AND gate designed for use in digital circuits. It can interface with both 3.3 V and 5 V devices, making it suitable for mixed-voltage applications. The device features Schmitt-trigger inputs, which enhance its tolerance to slower input signal transitions.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VCC): 1.2 V to 3.6 V (functional range)
  - Absolute Maximum Supply Voltage: -0.5 V to +6.5 V
  - Input Voltage: -0.5 V to +6.5 V
  - Overvoltage Tolerance: Inputs can withstand up to 5.5 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Current (IO): ±50 mA
  - Input Clamping Current (IIK): -50 mA (for VI < 0 V)
  - Supply Current (ICC): 100 mA maximum

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Total Power Dissipation (Ptot): 500 mW (derates with temperature)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +125 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - TSSOP14 (Thin Shrink Small Outline Package)
  - Body Width: 4.4 mm

- **Special Features:**
  - Schmitt-trigger inputs for improved noise immunity
  - ESD protection: HBM class 2 (exceeds 2000 V), CDM class C3 (exceeds 1000 V)
  - Direct interface with TTL levels

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level: 1 (according to JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The 74LVC08A is commonly used in:
- Digital logic circuits for implementing AND logic functions.
- Voltage level translation between 3.3 V and 5 V systems.
- Applications requiring noise immunity due to its Schmitt-trigger inputs.
- General-purpose logic applications in consumer electronics, automotive systems, and industrial controls.

This component is ideal for designers looking for a reliable and versatile logic gate that can operate in a wide range of conditions and environments.
