Low ripple Burst Mode operation  \nmaintains high efficiency at low output currents while keep-\ning the  output ripple below 10mV in a typical application. \nA \nminimum dropout voltage of 530mV is maintained when \nthe input voltage drops below the programmed output volt-\nage, such as during automotive cold crank. Current mode \ntopology \nis used for fast transient response and good loop \nstability. A catch diode current limit provides protection \nagainst shorted outputs and overvoltage conditions, with \nthermal shutdown providing additional fault protection. An  \naccurate programmable undervoltage lockout feature is \navailable, producing a low shutdown current of 0.75µA. \nA power good flag signals when V OUT reaches 90% of \nthe programmed output voltage. The LT3973 is available \nin small, thermally enhanced 10-lead MSOP and 3mm × \n3mm DFN packages.\nL, LT , LT C, LT M, Linear Technology, the Linear logo and Burst Mode are registered trademarks  \nof Linear Technology Corporation.

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: The LT3973E is guaranteed to meet performance specifications \nfrom 0°C to 125°C junction temperature. Specifications over the –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by design, characterization, and correlation with statistical process controls. The LT3973I is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. The LT3973H is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 150°C operating junction temperature range. High junction temperatures degrade operating lifetimes. Operating lifetime is derated at junction temperatures greater than 125°C. The junction temperature (T\nJ, in °C) is \ncalculated from the ambient temperature (T A in °C) and power dissipation \n(PD, in Watts) according to the formula:\n TJ = TA + (PD • θ JA)\nwhere θ JA (in °C/W) is the package thermal impedance.Note 3: This is the minimum input voltage for operation with accurate FB reference voltage.\nNote 4: This is the minimum voltage across the boost capacitor needed to \nguarantee full saturation of the switch.\nNote 5: The LT3973 contains circuitry that  extends the maximum duty \ncycle  if there is sufficient voltage across the boost capacitor. See the \nApplication Information section for more details.Note 6:\n This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended \nto protect the device during momentary overload conditions. Junction \ntemperature will exceed the maximum operating junction temperature when overtemperature protection is active.

If programmed output is greater \nthan 14V, tie this pin to GND.EN/UVLO (Pin 3): The part is in shutdown when this pin is \nlow and active when this pin is high. The threshold voltage \nis 1.19V going up with 30mV of hysteresis. Tie to V\nIN if \nshutdown feature is not used. The EN/UVLO threshold is \naccurate only when V IN is above 4.2V. If V IN is lower than \n4.2V, ground EN/UVLO to place the part in shutdown.V\nIN (Pin 4): The V IN pin supplies current to the LT3973’s \ninternal circuitry and to the internal power switch. This \npin must be locally bypassed.GND\n (Pin 5, Exposed Pad Pin 11): Ground. The exposed \npad must be soldered to the PCB.SW (Pin 6): The SW pin is the output of an internal power \nswitch. Connect this pin to the inductor.BOOST (Pin 7): This pin is used to provide a drive volt -\nage, higher  than the input voltage, to the internal bipolar \nNPN power switch.BD\n (Pin 8): This pin connects to the anode of the boost \ndiode. This pin also supplies current to the LT3973’s \ninternal regulator when BD is above 3.2V. PG (Pin 9): The PG pin is the open-drain output of an \ninternal comparator. PG remains low until the FB pin is \nwithin 10% of the final regulation voltage. PG is valid when \nV\nIN is above 4.2V and EN/UVLO is high.\nRT (Pin 10): A resistor is tied between RT and ground to \nset the switching frequency.\nLT3973/LT3973-3.3/LT3973-510\n3973fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3973BLOCK DIAGRAM\nRSWITCH LATCHDBOOST\nDCATCHBOOST\nOSCILLATOR\n200kHz TO 2.2MHzSLOPE COMP\nSQ–\n+\n–+–\n+\nBurst Mode\nDETECTERROR\nAMP1.09VSHDN EN/UVLO1.21VC1VIN\nINTERNAL 1.21V REF\n–+\nRT\nRTPG\nFB\nR2 R1VC\nVOUT GND\nL T3973 ONL YVIN\nBDOUT\nSWVOUT\nC2C3\n3973 BDL1\n–+ +–\nR2 R1\nL T3973-3.3 AND\nL T3973-5 ONL Y*\n* L T3973-3.3: R1 = 12.72M, R2 = 7.39M L T3973-5: R1 = 15.23M, R2 = 4.88M\nLT3973/LT3973-3.3/LT3973-511\n3973fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3973OPERATION\nThe LT3973 is a constant frequency, current mode step-\ndown regulator. An oscillator, with frequency set by RT, \nsets an RS flip-flop, turning on the internal power switch. \nAn amplifier and comparator monitor the current flowing \nbetween the V IN and SW pins, turning the switch-off when \nthis current reaches a level determined by the voltage at \nVC (see Block Diagram). An error amplifier measures the \noutput voltage through an external resistor divider tied to \nthe FB pin and servos the V C node. If the error amplifier’s \noutput increases, more current is delivered to the output; \nif it decreases, less current is delivered.\nAnother comparator monitors the current flowing through \nthe catch diode and reduces the operating frequency when \nthe current exceeds the 1.15A bottom current limit. This \nfoldback in frequency helps to control the output current \nin fault conditions such as a shorted output with high \ninput voltage. Maximum deliverable current to the output \nis therefore limited by both switch current limit and catch \ndiode current limit.An internal regulator provides power to the control cir -\ncuitry. The bias regulator normally draws power from \nthe \nVIN pin, but if the BD pin is connected to an external \nvoltage \nhigher than 3.2V, bias power will be drawn from \nthe external source (typically the regulated output voltage). \nThis improves efficiency. If the EN/UVLO pin is low, the LT3973 is shut down and draws  \n0.75µA from the input. When the EN/UVLO pin exceeds  \n1.19V, the switching regulator will become active.  Under-\nvoltage lockout is programmable via this pin.The \nswitch driver operates from either V IN or from the \nBOOST pin. An external capacitor is used to generate a \nvoltage at the BOOST pin that is higher than the input \nsupply. This allows the driver to fully saturate the internal \nbipolar NPN power switch for efficient operation. \nTo further optimize efficiency, the LT3973 automatically \nswitches to Burst Mode operation in light load situations. \nBetween bursts, all circuitry associated with controlling \nthe output switch is shut down reducing the input supply \ncurrent to 1.8µA.If the input voltage decreases towards the programmed \noutput voltage, the LT3973 will start to skip switch- off times  \nand decrease the switching frequency to maintain output \nregulation up to a maximum duty cycle of approximately \n97.5%. When the OUT pin is tied to V\nOUT, the LT3973 \nregulates the  output such that it stays more than 530mV \nbelow \nVIN; this sets a minimum dropout voltage. This \nenforced minimum dropout voltage limits the duty cycle \nand keeps the boost capacitor charged during dropout \nconditions. Since sufficient boost voltage is maintained, \nthe internal switch can fully saturate yielding good dropout \nperformance.The LT3973 contains a power good comparator which \ntrips when the FB pin is at 90% of its regulated value. The \nPG output is an open-drain transistor that is off when the \noutput is in regulation, allowing an external resistor to pull \nthe PG pin high. Power good is valid when the LT3973 is \nenabled and V\nIN is above 4.2V.\nLT3973/LT3973-3.3/LT3973-512\n3973fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3973APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFB Resistor Network\nThe output voltage is programmed with a resistor divider \nbetween the output and the FB pin.

Note \nthat choosing larger resistors will decrease the quiescent \ncurrent of the application circuit.\nSetting the Switching Frequency\nThe LT3973 uses a constant frequency PWM  architecture \nthat can be programmed to switch from 200kHz to 2.2MHz \nby using a resistor tied from the RT pin to ground. A table \nshowing the necessary R T value for a desired switching \nfrequency is in Table 1.\nTable 1. Switching Frequency vs R T Value\nSWITCHING FREQUENCY (MHz) RT VALUE (kΩ)\n0.2 \n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2732 475 340 267 215 150 115 \n90.9 73.2 61.9 51.1 43.2 36.5\nOperating Frequency T rade-Offs\nSelection of the operating frequency is a trade-off between \nefficiency, component size, and maximum input voltage. \nThe advantage of high frequency operation is that smaller \ninductor and capacitor values may be used. The disad -\nvantages are  lower efficiency, and narrower input voltage \nrange\n at constant- frequency. The highest acceptable  \nswitching frequency (f SW(MAX) ) for a given application \ncan be calculated as follows:\n  fSW(MAX) =VOUT+VD\ntON(MIN) VIN– VSW+VD ( )where V IN is the typical input voltage, V OUT is the output \nvoltage, V D is the integrated catch diode drop (~0.7V), \nand V SW is the internal switch drop (~0.5V at max load). \nThis equation shows that slower switching frequency is \nnecessary to accommodate high V IN/VOUT ratio. This is \ndue to the limitation on the LT3973’s minimum on-time. The minimum on-time is a strong function of temperature. \nUse the minimum switch on-time curve (see Typical Per -\nformance Characteristics ) \n to design for an application’s \nmaximum temperature, while adding about 30% for \npart-to-part variation. The minimum duty cycle that can \nbe achieved taking this on-time into account is: \n DCMIN = tON(MIN) • fSW\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency, and the t ON(MIN)  is \nthe minimum switch on-time. \nA good choice of switching frequency should allow ad -\nequate input voltage range (see next two sections) and \nkeep the inductor and capacitor values small.\nMinimum Input V\noltage Range\nThe minimum input voltage for regulation is determined \nby either the LT3973’s minimum operating voltage of \n4.2V, its maximum duty cycle, or the enforced minimum \ndropout voltage. See the typical performance  character-\nistics section for the minimum input voltage across load \nfor outputs of 3.3V and 5V.\nThe \nduty cycle is the fraction of time that the internal \nswitch is on during a clock cycle. Unlike many fixed fre -\nquency regulators , the LT3973 can extend its duty cycle \nby remaining on for multiple clock cycles. The LT3973 \nwill not switch off at the end of each clock cycle if there \nis sufficient voltage across the boost capacitor (C3 in the Block Diagram). Eventually, the voltage on the boost capacitor falls and requires refreshing. When this occurs, \nthe switch will turn off, allowing the inductor current to \nrecharge the boost capacitor. This places a limitation on \nthe maximum duty cycle as follows:\n DCMAX = 1/(1+1/ β SW)\nwhere βSW is equal to the SW pin current divided by \nthe BOOST pin current (see the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section), generally leading to a DC MAX of \nLT3973/LT3973-3.3/LT3973-513\n3973fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3973APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nabout 97.5%. This leads to a minimum input voltage of \napproximately:\n \n VIN(MIN1) =VOUT+VD\nDCMAX– VD+VSW \nwhere V OUT is the output voltage, V D is the catch diode \ndrop (~0.7V), V SW is the internal switch drop (~0.5V at \nmax load), and DC MAX is the maximum duty cycle. \nThe final factor affecting the minimum input voltage is the \nminimum dropout voltage. When the OUT pin is tied to \nVOUT, the LT3973 regulates the output such that it stays \nmore than 530mV below V IN. This enforced minimum \ndropout voltage is due to reasons that are covered in a \nlater section. This places a limitation on the minimum \ninput voltage as follows:\n VIN(MIN2)  = V OUT + V DROPOUT(MIN)\nwhere V OUT is the output voltage and V DROPOUT(MIN)  is \nthe minimum dropout voltage (530mV).\nCombining these factors leads to the overall minimum \ninput voltage:\n VIN(MIN)  = max(V IN(MIN1) , VIN(MIN2) , 4.2V)\nNote that the LT3973 will begin switching at a lower input \nvoltage (typically 3V) but will regulate to a lower FB voltage \nin this region of operation (see the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section).\nMaximum Input Voltage Range\nThe highest allowed V IN during normal operation (V IN(OP-\nMAX)) is limited by minimum duty cycle and can be calcu-\nlated by the following equation: \n \n VIN(OP-MAX) =VOUT+VD\nfSW• tON(MIN)– VD+VSW\nwhere t ON(MIN)  is the minimum switch on time. \nHowever, the circuit will tolerate inputs up to the absolute \nmaximum ratings of the V IN and BOOST pins, regardless of \nchosen switching frequency. During such transients where  \nVIN is higher than V IN(OP-MAX) , the switching frequency will be reduced below the programmed frequency to prevent \ndamage to the part. The output voltage ripple and inductor \ncurrent ripple may also be higher than in typical operation, \nhowever the output will still be in regulation. \nInductor Selection\nFor a given input and output voltage, the inductor value \nand switching frequency will determine the ripple current. \nThe ripple current increases with higher V IN or V OUT and \ndecreases with higher inductance and faster switching \nfrequency. A good starting point for selecting the induc -\ntor value is:\n  L=1.5VOUT+VD\nfSW\nwhere V D is the voltage drop of the catch diode (~0.7V), \nL is in µH and f SW is in MHz. The inductor’s RMS current \nrating must be greater than the maximum load current \nand its saturation current should be about 30% higher. For robust operation in fault conditions (start-up or short \ncircuit) and high input voltage (>30V), the saturation cur -\nrent should  be above 1.5A. To \n keep the efficiency high, \nthe series resistance (DCR) should be less than 0.1Ω, and \nthe core material should be intended for high frequency \napplications.

As a \ngeneral rule, lower output voltages and higher switching frequency will require smaller inductor values. If the ap -\nplication requires  \n less than 750mA load current, then a \nlesser inductor value may be acceptable. This allows use \nof a physically smaller inductor, or one with a lower DCR \nresulting in higher efficiency. There are several graphs in \nthe Typical Performance Characteristics section of this data \nLT3973/LT3973-3.3/LT3973-514\n3973fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3973APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nsheet that show the maximum load current as a function \nof input voltage for several popular output voltages. Low \ninductance may result in discontinuous mode operation, \nwhich is acceptable but reduces maximum load current. \nFor details of maximum output current and discontinu -\nous mode  operation, see Application Note  44. Finally, for \nduty cycles greater than 50% (V OUT/VIN > 0.5), there is \na minimum inductance required to avoid subharmonic \noscillations. See Application Note 19. \nInput Capacitor\nBypass the input of the LT3973 circuit with a ceramic capaci -\ntor of  X7R or X5R type. Y5V types have poor performance \nover \ntemperature and applied voltage, and should not be \nused. A 4.7µF ceramic capacitor is adequate to bypass the \nLT3973 and will easily handle the ripple current. Note that \nlarger input capacitance is required when a lower switching  \nfrequency is used (due to longer on-times). If the input \npower source has high impedance, or there is significant \ninductance due to long wires or cables, additional bulk capacitance may be necessary. This can be provided with \na low performance electrolytic capacitor.\nStep-down regulators draw current from the input sup -\nply in  pulses with very fast rise and fall times. The input \ncapacitor \n is required to reduce the resulting voltage  \nripple at the LT3973 and to force this very high frequency \nswitching current into a tight local loop, minimizing EMI. \nA 4.7µF capacitor is capable of this task, but only if it is \nplaced close to the LT3973 (see the PCB Layout section). \nA second precaution regarding the ceramic input capacitor  \nconcerns the maximum input voltage rating of the LT3973. \nA ceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable \ninductance forms a high quality (under damped) tank \ncircuit. If the LT3973 circuit is plugged into a live supply, \nthe input voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, pos -\nsibly exceeding the LT3973’s voltage rating. This situation \nis easily avoided (see the Hot Plugging Safely section).\nOutput Capacitor and Output Ripple\nThe output capacitor has two essential functions. It stores \nenergy in order to satisfy transient loads and stabilize the \nLT3973’s control loop. Ceramic capacitors have very low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and provide the best \nripple performance. A good starting value is:\n  COUT=50\nVOUT• fSW\nwhere f SW is in MHz and C OUT is the recommended output \ncapacitance in μF. Use X5R or X7R types. This choice will \nprovide low output ripple and good transient response. \nT ransient performance can be improved with a higher value  \ncapacitor if combined with a phase lead capacitor (typically  \n15pF) between the output and the feedback pin. A lower \nvalue of output capacitor can be used to save space and \ncost but transient performance will suffer.The second function is that the output capacitor, along \nwith the inductor, filters the square wave generated by the \nLT3973 to produce the DC output. In this role it determines \nthe output ripple, so low impedance (at the switching \nfrequency) is important. The output ripple decreases with \nincreasing output capacitance, down to approximately \n1mV. See Figure 1. Note that a larger phase lead capacitor should be used with a large output capacitor. \nFigure 1. Worst-Case Output Ripple Across Full Load Range\nWhen choosing a capacitor, look carefully through the \ndata sheet to find out what the actual capacitance is under \noperating conditions (applied voltage and temperature). \nA physically larger capacitor or one with a higher voltage \nrating may be required.

However, ceramic capacitors can cause problems \nwhen used with the LT3973 due to their piezoelectric nature. \nWhen in Burst Mode operation, the LT3973’s switching \nfrequency depends on the load current, and at very light \nloads the LT3973 can excite the ceramic capacitor at audio \nfrequencies, generating audible noise. Since the LT3973 \noperates at a lower current limit during Burst Mode op -\neration, the noise is typically very quiet to a casual ear. If \nthis \nis unacceptable, use a high performance tantalum or \nelectrolytic capacitor at the output.A final precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns \nthe maximum input voltage rating of the LT3973. As pre -\nviously mentioned , \n a ceramic input capacitor combined \nwith trace or cable inductance forms a high quality (under \ndamped) tank circuit. If the LT3973 circuit is plugged into a \nlive supply, the input voltage can ring to twice its nominal \nvalue, possibly exceeding the LT3973’s rating. This situa -\ntion is easily  avoided ( see the Hot Plugging Safely  section).\nLow Ripple Burst Mode Operation\nTo \nenhance efficiency at light loads, the LT3973 operates \nin low ripple Burst Mode operation which keeps the output \ncapacitor charged to the proper voltage while minimizing \nthe input quiescent current. During Burst Mode opera -\ntion, the LT3973 delivers single cycle bursts of current \nto \nthe output capacitor followed by sleep periods where \nthe output power is delivered to the load by the output \ncapacitor. Because the LT3973 delivers power to the output  \nwith single, low current pulses, the output ripple is kept \nbelow 10mV for a typical application. See Figure 2.\nAs the load current decreases towards a no load condi -\ntion, the  percentage of time that the LT3973 operates in \nsleep \nmode increases and the average input current is greatly reduced resulting in high efficiency even at very \nlow loads. Note that during Burst Mode operation, the \nswitching frequency will be lower than the programmed \nswitching frequency. See Figure 3.At higher output loads (above 90mA for the front page \napplication) the LT3973 will be running at the frequency \nprogrammed by the R\nT resistor, and will be operating in \nstandard PWM  mode.

For out-\nputs of  2.2 V and above, the standard circuit (Figure 4a) is \nbest. For outputs between 2.2V and 2.5V, use a 1µF boost \ncapacitor. For output voltages below 2.2V, the boost diode \ncan be tied to the input (Figure 4b), or to another external \nsupply greater than 2.2V. However, the circuit in Figure 4a is more efficient because the BOOST pin current and BD \npin quiescent current come from a lower voltage source. \nYou must also be sure that the maximum voltage ratings \nof the BOOST and BD pins are not exceeded.

This enforced minimum \ndropout voltage keeps the boost capacitor charged re-\ngardless of  load during dropout conditions. The LT3973 \nachieves \nthis by limiting the duty cycle and forcing the \nswitch to turn off regularly to charge the boost capaci -\ntor. Since sufficient voltage across the boost capacitor is \nmaintained, \nthe switch is allowed to fully saturate and the \ninternal switch drop stays low for good dropout perfor -\nmance. Figure 6 shows the overall V IN to VOUT performance  \nduring start-up and dropout conditions. The LT3973 monitors the boost capacitor for sufficient \nvoltage such that the switch is allowed to fully saturate. \nDuring start-up conditions when the boost capacitor may \nnot be fully charged, the switch will operate with about \n1V of drop, and an internal current source will begin to \npull 70mA (typical) from the OUT pin which is typically \nconnected to V OUT. This current forces the LT3973 to \nswitch more often and with more inductor current, which \nrecharges the boost capacitor. When the boost capacitor \nis sufficiently charged, the current source turns off, and \nthe part may enter Burst Mode.

UVLO \nprevents the regulator from operating at source voltages \nwhere the problems might occur.

Note that large, switched currents  \nflow in the LT3973’s V IN and SW pins, the internal catch  \ndiode and the input capacitor. The loop formed by these  \ncomponents should be as small as possible. These compo -\nnents, along with  the inductor and output capacitor, should  \nbe placed on the same side of the circuit board, and their \nconnections should be made on that layer. Place a local, \nunbroken ground plane below these components. The SW \nand BOOST nodes should  be  as small as possible. Finally, \nkeep the FB nodes small so that the ground traces will shield  \nthem from the SW and BOOST nodes. The exposed pad on \nthe bottom must be soldered to ground so that the pad acts \nas a heat sink. To keep thermal resistance low, extend the \nground plane as much as possible, and add thermal vias \nunder and near the LT3973 to additional ground planes  \nwithin the circuit board and on the bottom side.\nHot Plugging SafelyThe small size, robustness and low impedance of ceramic \ncapacitors make them an attractive option for the input \nbypass capacitor of LT3973 circuits. However, these ca -\npacitors can cause problems if the LT3973 is plugged into \na \nlive supply. The low loss ceramic capacitor, combined \nwith stray inductance in series with the power source, \nforms an under damped tank circuit, and the voltage at \nthe V IN pin of the LT3973 can ring to twice the nominal \ninput voltage, possibly exceeding the LT3973’s rating and \ndamaging the part. If the input supply is poorly controlled \nor the user will be plugging the LT3973 into an energized \nsupply, the input network should be designed to  prevent \nthis \novershoot. See Application Note  88 \nfor a complete \ndiscussion.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n68\n7910\n542\n31\nVIAS TO LOCAL GROUND PLANE\nVIAS TO V OUTEN/UVLOGND\nGND\nPG\nVOUT GNDVIN\n3973 F09\nHigh Temperature Considerations\nFor higher ambient temperatures, care should be taken \nin the layout of the PCB to ensure good heat sinking of \nthe LT3973. The exposed pad on the bottom must be \nsoldered to a ground plane. This ground should be tied to \nlarge copper layers below with thermal vias; these layers \nwill spread the heat dissipated by the LT3973. Placing \nadditional vias can reduce thermal resistance further. The \nmaximum load current should be derated as the ambient \ntemperature approaches the maximum junction rating. Power dissipation within the LT3973 can be estimated by \ncalculating  the total power  loss from an efficiency measure -\nment and subtracting inductor loss. The die temperature \nis \ncalculated by multiplying the LT3973 power dissipation \nby the thermal resistance from junction to ambient. Finally, be aware that at high ambient temperatures the \ninternal Schottky diode will have significant leakage cur -\nrent (see the  Typical Performance Characteristics section) \nincreasing \nthe quiescent current of the LT3973 converter.\nOther Linear Technology PublicationsApplication Notes 19, 35 and 44 contain more detailed \ndescriptions and design information for buck regulators \nand other switching regulators.
