The MAX4080 is designed for uni -\ndirectional current-sense applications and the MAX4081 \nallows bidirectional current sensing. The MAX4081 sin -\ngle output pin continuously monitors the transition from \ncharge to discharge and avoids the need for a separate \npolarity output. The MAX4081 requires an external refer -\nence to set the zero-current output level (V SENSE  = 0V). \nThe charging current is represented by an output voltage \nfrom V REF to V CC, while discharge current is given from \nVREF to GND. \nFor maximum versatility, the 76V input voltage range \napplies independently to both supply voltage (V CC) and \ncommon-mode input voltage (V RS+). High-side current \nmonitoring does not interfere with the ground path of the \nload being measured, making the MAX4080/MAX4081 \nparticularly useful in a wide range of high-voltage sys -\ntems. \nThe combination of three gain versions (5V/V, 20V/V, \n60V/V = F, T, S suffix) and a user-selectable, external \nsense resistor sets the full-scale current reading and its \nproportional output voltage. The MAX4080/MAX4081 \noffer a high level of integration, resulting in a simple, accu -\nrate, and compact current-sense solution.\nThe MAX4080/MAX4081 operate from a 4.5V to 76V sin -\ngle supply and draw only 75µA of supply current. These \ndevices are specified over the automotive operating tem -\nperature range (-40°C to +125°C) and are available in a \nspace-saving 8-pin µMAX® or SO package.\n Applications\n ●Automotive (12V, 24V, or 42V Batteries)\n ●48V Telecom and Backplane Current Measurement\n ●Bidirectional Motor Control\n ●Power-Management Systems\n ●Avalanche Photodiode and PIN-Diode Current  \n Monitoring\n ●General System/Board-Level Current Sensing\n ●Precision High-Voltage Current SourcesBenefits and Features\n ●Ideal for High-Voltage Current Monitoring Applications\n• Wide 4.5V to 76V Input Common-Mode Range\n• Independent Operating Supply Voltage\n ●High Accuracy and Low Quiescent Current Support \nPrecision Application Requirements\n• ±0.1% Full-Scale Accuracy\n• Low 100μV Input Offset Voltage\n• Three Gain Versions Available\n -5V/V (MAX4080F/MAX4081F)\n -20V/V (MAX4080T/MAX4081T)\n -60V/V (MAX4080S/MAX4081S)\n• 75μA Supply Current (MAX4080)\n ●Flexible Current Sensing Supports Monitoring of \nCharge and Discharge of Batteries\n• Bidirectional (MAX4081) or Unidirectional \n(MAX4080) I SENSE\n• Reference Input for Bidirectional OUT (MAX4081)\n ●Minimizes Required Board Space\n• 8-Pin μMAX Package\n19-2562; Rev 6; 12/20Click here  to ask about the production status of specific part numbers.\n+Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.\n/V denotes an automotive qualified part.PART TEMP RANGE PIN-PACKAGE\nMAX4080 FAUA+ -40°C to +125 °C 8 µMAX\nMAX4080FAUA/V+ -40°C to +125 °C 8 µMAX\nMAX4080FASA+ -40°C to +125 °C 8 SO\nMAX4080TAUA+ -40°C to +125 °C 8 µMAX\nMAX4080TAUA/V+ -40°C to +125 °C 8 µMAX\nN.C.\nOUT GND1+\n28\n7RS-\nN.C.

This feature allows the monitoring of current out \nof a battery as low as 4.5V and also enables high-side cur -\nrent sensing at voltages greater than the supply voltage \n(VCC). The MAX4080/MAX4081 monitors current through \na current-sense resistor and amplifies the voltage across \nthe resistor. The MAX4080 senses current unidirectional -\nly, while the MAX4081 senses current bidirectionally. \nThe 76V input voltage range of the MAX4080/MAX4081 \napplies independently to both supply voltage (V CC) and \ncommon-mode, input-sense voltage (V RS+). High-side \ncurrent monitoring does not interfere with the ground \npath of the load being measured, making the MAX4080/\nMAX4081 particularly useful in a wide range of high-volt -\nage systems. \nBattery-powered systems require a precise bidirectional \ncurrent-sense amplifier to accurately monitor the battery’s \ncharge and discharge. The MAX4081 charging current \nis represented by an output voltage from V REF to V CC, \nwhile discharge current is given from V REF to GND. \nMeasurements of OUT with respect to V REF yield a posi -\ntive and negative voltage during charge and discharge, as \nillustrated in Figure 1 for the MAX4081T.Current Monitoring \nThe MAX4080 operates as follows: current from the \nsource flows through R SENSE  to the load (Figure 2), cre -\nating a sense voltage, V SENSE . Since the internal-sense \namplifier’s inverting input has high impedance, negligible \ncurrent flows through RG2 (neglecting the input bias \ncurrent). Therefore, the sense amplifier’s inverting input \nvoltage equals V SOURCE  - (ILOAD )(RSENSE ). The ampli -\nfier’s open-loop gain forces its noninverting input to the \nsame voltage as the inverting input. Therefore, the drop \nacross RG1 equals V SENSE . The internal current mirror \nmultiplies I RG1 by a current gain factor, β, to give I A2 =  \nβ × IRG1. Amplifier A2 is used to convert the output  \ncurrent to a voltage and then sent through amplifier \nA3. Total gain = 5V/V for MAX4080F, 20V/V for the \nMAX4080T, and 60V/V for the MAX4080S.\nThe MAX4081 input stage differs slightly from the \nMAX4080 (Figure 3). Its topology allows for monitoring \nof bidirectional currents through the sense resistor. When \ncurrent flows from RS+ to RS-, the MAX4081 matches the \nvoltage drop across the external sense resistor, R SENSE , \nby increasing the current through the Q1 and RG1.

V REF is defined as \nthe average voltage of V REF1A  and V REF1B . Connect \nREF1A and REF1B to a low-noise, regulated voltage \nsource to set the output reference level. In this mode, \nVOUT equals V REF1A  when V SENSE  equals zero (see \nFigure 4).\nAlternatively, connect REF1B to ground, and REF1A to a \nlow-noise, regulated voltage source. In this case, the out -\nput reference level (V REF) is equal to V REF1A  divided by \ntwo. V OUT equals V REF1A /2 when V SENSE  equals zero.\nIn either mode, the output swings above the reference \nvoltage for positive current-sensing (V RS+ > V RS-). The \noutput swings below the reference voltage for negative \ncurrent-sensing (V RS+ < VRS-).Applications Information\nRecommended Component Values\nIdeally, the maximum load current develops the full-scale \nsense voltage across the current-sense resistor. Choose \nthe gain needed to yield the maximum output voltage \nrequired for the application:\nVOUT = VSENSE  5 AV\nwhere V SENSE  is the full-scale sense voltage, 1000mV \nfor gain of 5V/V, 250mV for gain of 20V/V, 100mV for gain \nof 60V/V, and  A V is the gain of the device. \nIn applications monitoring a high current, ensure that \nRSENSE  is able to dissipate its own I 2R loss. If the resis -\ntor’s power dissipation is exceeded, its value may drift or \nit may fail altogether.\nThe MAX4080/MAX4081 sense a wide variety of currents \nwith different sense-resistor values.

V SENSE(MAX)  is \n1000mV for the 5V/V gain version, 250mV for the 20V/V \ngain version, and 100mV for the 60V/V gain version. \nChoosing the Sense Resistor\nChoose R SENSE  based on the following criteria:\nVoltage Loss:  A high R SENSE  value causes the pow -\ner-source voltage to degrade through IR loss. For minimal \nvoltage loss, use the lowest R SENSE  value.\n ●Accuracy: A high R SENSE  value allows lower cur -\nrents to be measured more accurately. This is due \nto offsets becoming less significant when the sense  \nvoltage is larger. For best performance, select \nRSENSE  to provide approximately 1000mV (gain of \n5V/V), 250mV (gain of 20V/V), or 100mV (gain of \n60V/V) of sense voltage for the full-scale current in \neach application.\n ●Efficiency and Power Dissipation: At high current lev -\nels, the I 2R losses in R SENSE  can be significant. Take \nthis into consideration when choosing the resistor \nvalue and its power dissipation (wattage) rating. Also, \nthe sense resistor’s value might drift if it is allowed to \nheat up excessively.\n ●Inductance: Keep inductance low if I SENSE  has a \nlarge high-frequency component. Wire-wound resis -\ntors have the highest inductance, while metal film is \nsomewhat better. Low-inductance, metal-film resistors \nare also available. Instead of being spiral- wrapped \naround a core, as in metal-film or wire-wound resis -\ntors, they are a straight band of metal and are avail -\nable in values under 1Ω.Because of the high currents that flow through R SENSE , \ntake care to eliminate parasitic trace resistance from \ncausing errors in the sense voltage. Either use a four-ter -\nminal current-sense resistor or use Kelvin (force and \nsense) PC board layout techniques.\nDynamic Range Consideration\nAlthough the MAX4081 have fully symmetrical bidirec -\ntional V SENSE  input capability, the output voltage range \nis usually higher from REF to V CC and lower from REF \nto GND (unless the supply voltage is at the lowest end of \nthe operating range). Therefore, the user must consider \nthe dynamic range of current monitored in both directions \nand choose the supply voltage and the reference voltage \n(REF) to make sure the output swing above and below \nREF is adequate to handle the swings without clipping or \nrunning out of headroom.\nPower-Supply Bypassing and Grounding\nFor most applications, bypass V CC to GND with a 0.1µF \nceramic capacitor. In many applications, V CC can be \nconnected to one of the current monitor terminals (RS+ \nor RS-). Because V CC is independent of the monitored \nvoltage, V CC can be connected to a separate regulated \nsupply.\nIf VCC will be subject to fast-line transients, a series \nresistor can be added to the power-supply line of the \nMAX4080/MAX4081 to minimize output disturbance. This \nresistance and the decoupling capacitor reduce the rise \ntime of the transient. For most applications, 1k Ω in con -\njunction with a 0.1µF bypass capacitor work well.\nThe MAX4080/MAX4081 require no special consider -\nations with respect to layout or grounding. Consideration \nshould be given to minimizing errors due to the large \ncharge and discharge currents in the system.Figure 4.
