C For more information www.analog.com Document FeedbackAPPLICATIONSFEATURES DESCRIPTIONSurge Stopper\nThe LT®4356  surge stopper protects loads from high voltage \ntransients. It regulates the output during an overvoltage \nevent, such as load dump in automobiles, by controlling the gate of an external N-channel MOSFET . The output is limited to a safe value thereby allowing the loads to con -\ntinue functioning. The L T4356 also monitors the voltage drop between the V\nCC and SNS pins to protect against \novercurrent faults. An internal amplifier limits the current sense voltage to 50mV . In either fault condition, a timer is started inversely proportional to MOSFET stress. If the timer expires, the F LT  pin pulls low to warn of an impend -\ning power down. If the condition persists, the MOSFET is turned \noff. After a cool down period, the GATE pin pulls \nup turning on the MOSFET again.\nThe auxiliary amplifier may be used as a voltage detection \ncomparator or as a linear regulator controller driving an external PNP pass transistor .\nBack-to-back FETs can be used in lieu of a Schottky diode \nfor reverse input protection, reducing voltage drop and power loss. A shutdown pin reduces the quiescent current to less than 7µA for the L T4356-1 during shutdown. The L T4356-2 differs from the L T4356-1 during shutdown by reducing the quiescent current to 60µA and keeping alive the auxiliary amplifier for uses such as an undervoltage lockout or always-on regulator .n Automotive/Avionic Surge Protection\nn Hot Swap/Live Insertion\nn High Side Switch for Batter y Powered Systems\nn Intrinsic Safety Applicationsn Stops High V oltage Surges\nn Adjustable Output Clamp V oltage\nn Overcurrent Protection\nn Wide Operation Range: 4V to 80V\nn Reverse Input Protection to –60V\nn Low 7µA Shutdown Current (L T4356-1)\nn Auxiliar y Amplifier for Level Detection Comparator \nor Linear Regulator Controller (L T4356-2)\nn Adjustable Fault T imer\nn Controls N-channel MOSFET\nn Shutdown Pin Withstands –60V to 100V\nn Fault Output Indication\nn Guaranteed Operation to 125°C\nn Available in (4mm × 3mm) 12-Pin DFN,  \n10-Pin MSOP or 16-Pin SO Packages\n4A, 12V Overvoltage Output Regulator Overvoltage Protector Regulates Output at \n27V During T ransient\n0.1µF10/uni03A910m/uni03A9 IRLR2908VIN\n12V\n4356 TA01LT4356DE\nGND TMROUT GATE SNS\nIN+SHDN\nAOUT FAULTVOUT\nEN\nFLT UNDERVOLTAGEFBVCC\nDC-DC\nCONVERTER\nGNDSHDNVCC4.99k383k\n100k102k\n100ms/DIV4356 TA01bVIN\n20V/DIV\nVOUT\n20V/DIV80V INPUT SURGE CTMR = 6.8µF\nILOAD  = 500mA\n27V ADJUSTABLE CLAMP12V\n12VTYPICAL APPLICATIONAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Both voltage and current amplifiers control the GATE pin to regulate the output voltage and limit the current through the MOSFET .\nGND: Device Ground.IN\n+ (DFN and SO Packages Only): Positive Input of the \nAuxiliary Amplifier . This amplifier can be used as a level \ndetection comparator  with external hysteresis or linear regulator controlling an external PNP transistor . This pin is clamped internally to 7V . Connect to ground if unused.\nOUT: Output Voltage Sense Input. This pin senses the \nvoltage at the source of the N-channel MOSFET and sets the fault timer current. When the OUT pin voltage reaches \n0.7V away from V\nCC, the EN pin goes high impedance.SHDN: Shutdown Control Input. Pulling the SHDN pin low \nshuts the part down to a low current mode. All functions are turned off for the L T4356-1 while the internal reference and the auxiliary amplifier stay active for the L T4356-2. The SHDN input threshold is similar to a TTL input. If the \nSHDN voltage goes below 2.1V , the voltage must go below 0.4V for 100μs to properly shut down the part. To turn the part back on, the SHDN voltage must transition from below 0.4V to greater than 2.1V with a slew rate faster than 10V/ms. An internal, 4μA current source is provided to pull the SHDN pin up. An external pull-up device should \nbe used if the leakage current to ground might exceed 1μA. The SHDN pin can be pulled up to 100V or below GND by \n60V without damage. \nSNS: Current Sense Input. Connect this pin to the output of \nthe current sense resistor . The current limit circuit controls the GATE pin to limit the sense voltage between V\nCC and \nSNS pins to 50mV . At the same time the sense amplifier also starts a current source to charge up the TMR pin. This pin can be pulled below GND by up to 60V , though the voltage difference with the V\nCC pin must be limited to \nless than 30V . Connect to V CC if unused.\nTMR: Fault Timer Input. Connect a capacitor between this pin and ground to set the times for early warning, fault and cool down periods. The current charging up this pin during fault conditions depends on the voltage difference between the V\nCC and OUT pins. When V TMR reaches 1.25V , \nthe F LT pin pulls low to indicate the detection of a fault \ncondition. If the condition persists, the pass transistor turns off when V\nTMR reaches the threshold of 1.35V . As soon as \nthe fault condition disappears, the pull up current stops and a 2µA current starts to pull the TMR pin down. When V\nTMR reaches the retry threshold of 0.5V , the GATE pin pulls \nhigh turning back on the pass transistor . A minimum of 10nF capacitor is needed to compensate the loop. A 10V rated X7R capacitor is recommended for C\nTMR.\nVCC: Positive Supply Voltage Input. The positive supply \ninput ranges from 4V to 80V for normal operation. It can also be pulled below ground potential by up to 60V during a reverse battery condition, without damaging the part. The supply current is reduced to 7µA with all the functional blocks off.  \nLT4356-1/LT4356-29\nRev.

C For more information www.analog.comSome power systems must cope with high voltage surges \nof short duration such as those in automobiles. Load circuitry must be protected from these transients, yet high availability systems must continue operating during these events.\nThe L T4356 is an overvoltage protection regulator that \ndrives an external N-channel MOSFET as the pass transistor . It operates from a wide supply voltage range of 4V to 80V . It can also be pulled below ground potential by up to 60V without damage. The low power supply requirement of 4V allows it to operate even during cold cranking conditions in automotive applications. The internal charge pump turns on the N-channel MOSFET to supply current to the loads with very little power loss. T wo MOSFETs can be connected back to back to replace an inline Schottky diode for reverse input protection. This improves the efficiency and increases the available supply voltage level to the load circuitry during cold crank.\nNormally, the pass transistor is fully on, powering the loads \nwith very little voltage drop. When the supply voltage surges too high, the voltage amplifier (VA) controls the gate of the MOSFET and regulates the voltage at the source pin to a level that is set by the external resistive divider from the OUT pin to ground and the internal 1.25V reference. A current source starts charging up the capacitor connected at the TMR pin to ground. If the voltage at the TMR pin, V\nTMR, reaches 1.25V , the F LT  pin pulls low to indicate \nimpending turn-off due to the overvoltage condition. The pass transistor stays on until the TMR pin reaches 1.35V , at which point the GATE pin pulls low turning off the MOSFET .The potential at the TMR pin starts decreasing as soon as the output voltage is not being servoed, indicating the overvoltage condition has disappeared. When the voltage at the TMR pin reaches 0.5V the GATE pin begins rising, turning on the MOSFET . The FL T pin will then go to a high \nimpedance state.\nThe fault timer allows the load to continue functioning \nduring short transient events while protecting the MOSFET from being damaged by a long period of supply overvolt -\nage, such as a load dump in automobiles. The timer period varies with the voltage across the MOSFET\n. A higher voltage \ncorresponds to a shorter fault timer period, ensuring the MOSFET operates within its safe operating area (SOA).\nThe L T4356 senses an overcurrent condition by monitor -\ning the voltage across an optional sense resistor placed \nbetween the V\nCC and SNS pins. An active current limit \ncircuit (IA) controls the GATE pin to limit the sense voltage to 50mV . A current is also generated to start charging up the TMR pin. This current is about 5 times the current generated during an overvoltage event. The FL T pin pulls \nlow when the voltage at the TMR pin reaches 1.25V and the MOSFET is turned off when it reaches 1.35V .\nAn auxiliary amplifier is provided with the negative input \nconnected to an internal 1.25V reference. The output pull down device is capable of sinking up to 2mA of current allowing it to drive an LED or opto coupler . This amplifier can be configured as a linear regulator controller driving an external PNP transistor or a comparator function to monitor voltages.\nA shutdown pin turns off the pass transistor and reduces \nthe supply current to less than 7µA for the L T4356-1. The supply current drops down to 60µA while keeping the internal reference and the auxiliary amplifier active for the L T4356-2 version during shutdown.OPERATION\nLT4356-1/LT4356-211\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comThe L T4356 can limit the voltage and current to the load \ncircuitry during supply transients or overcurrent events. The total fault timer period should be set to ride through short overvoltage transients while not causing damage to the pass transistor . The selection of this N-channel MOSFET pass transistor is critical for this application. It must stay on and provide a low impedance path from the input supply to the load during normal operation and then dissipate power during overvoltage or overcurrent conditions.\nThe following sections describe the overcurrent and the \novervoltage faults, and the selection of the timer capacitor value based on the required warning time. The selection of the N-channel MOSFET pass transistor is discussed next. Auxiliary amplifier , reverse input, and the shutdown functions are covered after the MOSFET selection. External component selection is discussed in detail in the Design Example section.\nOvervoltage Fault\nThe L TC4356 limits the voltage at the OUT pin during an \novervoltage situation. An internal voltage amplifier regu -\nlates the GATE pin voltage to maintain a 1.25V threshold at the FB pin. During this period of time, the power MOSFET is still on and continues to supply current to the load. This allows uninterrupted operation during short over\nvoltage \ntransient events.\nWhen the voltage regulation loop is engaged for longer \nthan the time-out period, set by the timer capacitor con -\nnected from the TMR pin to ground, an overvoltage fault is detected. The GA\nTE pin is pulled down to the OUT pin by a \n150mA current. After the fault condition has disappeared and a cool down period has transpired, the GATE pin starts to pull high again. This prevents the power MOSFET from being damaged during a long period of overvoltage, such as during load dump in automobiles.Overcurrent Fault\nThe L T4356 features an adjustable current limit that \nprotects against short circuits or excessive load current. During an overcurrent event, the GATE pin is regulated to limit the current sense voltage across the V\nCC and SNS \npins to 50mV .\nAn overcurrent fault occurs when the current limit circuitry \nhas been engaged for longer than the time-out delay set by the timer capacitor . The GATE pin is then immediately pulled low by a 10mA current to GND turning off the MOSFET . After the fault condition has disappeared and a cool down period has transpired, the GATE pin is allowed to pull back up and turn on the pass transistor .\nFault Timer\nThe L T4356 includes an adjustable fault timer pin. Con -\nnecting a capacitor from the TMR pin to ground sets the \ndelay \ntimer period before the MOSFET is turned off. The \nsame capacitor also sets the cool down period before the MOSFET is allowed to turn back on after the fault condition has disappeared.\nOnce a fault condition, either overvoltage or overcurrent, \nis detected, a current source charges up the TMR pin. The current level varies depending on the voltage drop across the drain and source terminals of the power MOSFET( -\nV\nDS), which is typically from the V CC pin to the OUT pin. \nThis scheme takes better advantage of the available Safe Operating Area (SOA) of the MOSFET than would a fixed timer current. The timer function operates down to V\nCC = \n5V across the whole temperature range.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT4356-1/LT4356-212\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comFault Timer Current\nThe timer current starts at around 2µA with 0.5V or less of \nVDS, increasing linearly to 50µA with 75V of V DS during an \novervoltage fault (Figure\xa01). During an overcurrent fault, it starts at 4µA with 0.5V or less of V\nDS but increases \nto 260µA with 80V across the MOSFET (Figure\xa02). This arrangement allows the pass transistor to turn off faster during an overcurrent event, since more power is dissipated during this condition. Refer to the Typical Performance Characteristics section for the timer current at different V\nDS in both overvoltage and overcurrent events.When the voltage at the TMR pin, V TMR, reaches the 1.25V \nthreshold, the F LT  pin pulls low to indicate the detection \nof a fault condition and provide warning to the load of the impending power loss. In the case of an overvoltage fault, the timer current then switches to a fixed 5µA.

C For more information www.analog.comvoltage N-channel MOSFETs. For systems with V CC less \nthan 8V , a logic level MOSFET is required since the gate \ndrive can be as low as 4.5V .\nThe SOA of the MOSFET must encompass all fault con -\nditions. In normal operation the pass transistor is fully \non, dissipating ver\ny little power . But during either over -\nvoltage or overcurrent faults, the GATE pin is servoed to regulate either the output voltage or the current through the MOSFET\n. Large current and high voltage drop across \nthe MOSFET can coexist in these cases. The SOA curves of the MOSFET must be considered carefully along with the selection of the fault timer capacitor .\nT ransient Stress in the MOSFET\nDuring an overvoltage event, the L T4356 drives a series \npass MOSFET to regulate the output voltage at an acceptable level. The load circuitry may continue operating throughout this interval, but only at the expense of dissipation in the MOSFET pass device. MOSFET dissipation or stress is a function of the input voltage waveform, regulation voltage and load current. The MOSFET must be sized to survive this stress.\nMost transient event specifications use the model shown \nin Figure\xa03. The idealized waveform comprises a linear ramp of rise time t\nr, reaching a peak voltage of V PK and \nexponentially decaying back to V IN with a time constant \nof t. A common automotive transient specification has constants of t\nr = 10µs, V PK = 80V and t = 1ms. A surge \ncondition known as “load dump” has constants of t r = \n5ms, V PK = 60V and t = 200ms.This fixed early warning period allows the systems to per -\nform necessary backup or house-keeping functions before \nthe power supply is cut off. After V TMR crosses the 1.35V \nthreshold, the pass transistor turns off immediately. Note that during an overcurrent event, the timer current is not reduced to 5µA after V\nTMR has reached 1.25V threshold, \nsince it would lengthen the overall fault timer period and cause more stress on the power MOSFET .\nAs soon as the fault condition has disappeared, a 2µA \ncurrent starts to discharge the timer capacitor to ground. When V\nTMR reaches the 0.5V threshold, the internal charge \npump starts to pull the GATE pin high, turning on the MOSFET . The TMR pin is then actively regulated to 0.5V until the next fault condition appears. The total cool down timer period is given by:\n  tCOOL = CTMR • 0.85V\n2µA\nMOSFET Selection\nThe L T4356 drives an N-channel MOSFET to conduct the \nload current. The important features of the MOSFET are on-resistance R\nDS(ON) , the maximum drain-source voltage \nV(BR)DSS , the threshold voltage, and the SOA.\nThe maximum allowable drain-source voltage must be higher than the supply voltage. If the output is shorted to ground or during an overvoltage event, the full supply voltage will appear across the MOSFET .\nThe gate drive for the MOSFET is guaranteed to be more \nthan 10V and less than 16V for those applications with V\nCC \nhigher than 8V . This allows the use of standard threshold APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure\xa03. Prototypical T ransient WaveformVPK\nτ\nVIN\n4356 F03tr\nLT4356-1/LT4356-214\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nMOSFET stress is the result of power dissipated within \nthe device. For long duration surges of 100ms or more, stress is increasingly dominated by heat transfer; this is a matter of device packaging and mounting, and heatsink thermal mass. This is analyzed by simulation, using the MOSFET thermal model.\nFor short duration transients of less than 100ms, MOSFET \nsurvival is increasingly a matter of safe operating area (SOA), an intrinsic property of the MOSFET . SOA quantifies the time required at any given condition of V\nDS and I D to \nraise the junction temperature of the MOSFET to its rated maximum. MOSFET SOA is expressed in units of watt-squared-seconds (P\n2t). This figure is essentially constant \nfor intervals of less than 100ms for any given device type, and rises to infinity under DC operating conditions. Destruction mechanisms other than bulk die temperature distort the lines of an accurately drawn SOA graph so that P\n2t is not the same for all combinations of I D and V DS. \nIn particular P2t tends to degrade as V DS approaches the \nmaximum rating, rendering some devices useless for absorbing energy above a certain voltage.\nCalculating T ransient Stress\nTo select a MOSFET suitable for any given application, the \nSOA stress must be calculated for each input transient which shall not interrupt operation. It is then a simple matter to chose a device which has adequate SOA to survive the maximum calculated stress. P\n2t for a prototypical transient \nwaveform is calculated as follows (Figure\xa04).\nLet\n a = V REG – V IN \n b = V PK – V IN \n (VIN = Nominal Input Voltage)\nThen\n P2t = ILOAD21\n3trb−a( )3\nb+1\n2t2a2lnb\na+3a2+b2−4ab⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟⎡\n⎣⎢\n⎢⎤\n⎦⎥⎥Typically V REG ≈ V IN and t >>  t r simplifying the above to\n  P2t = 1\n2 ILOAD2VPK– VREG ( )2t (W2s)\nFor the transient conditions of V PK = 80V , V IN = 12V , V REG \n= 16V , t r = 10µs and t = 1ms, and a load current of 3A, \nP2t is 18.4W2s—easily handled by a MOSFET in a D-pak \npackage. The P2t of other transient waveshapes is evaluated \nby integrating the square of MOSFET power versus time.\nCalculating Short-Circuit Stress\nSOA stress must also be calculated for short-circuit con -\nditions. Short-circuit P2t is given by:\n \nP2t = (V IN • ΔV SNS/RSNS)2 • tTMR (W2s)\nwhere, ΔVSNS is the SENSE pin threshold, and t TMR is the \novercurrent timer interval.For V\nIN = 14.7V , V SNS = 50mV , R SNS = 12mΩ and C TMR \n= 100nF , P2t is 6.6W2s—less than the transient SOA \ncalculated in the previous example. Nevertheless, to  \naccount for circuit tolerances this figure should be doubled \nto 13.2W2s.\nLimiting Inrush Current and GATE Pin Compensation\nThe L T4356 limits the inrush current to any load capacitance \nby controlling the GATE pin voltage slew rate. An external capacitor can be connected from GATE to ground to slow down the inrush current further at the expense of slower turn-off time.

With transient input voltage step faster \nthan 5V/µs, a gate capacitor , C1, to ground is needed to prevent self enhancement of the N-channel MOSFET .\nThe extra gate capacitance slows down the turn off time \nduring fault conditions and may allow excessive current during an output short event. An extra resistor , R1, in series with the gate capacitor can improve the turn off time. A diode, D1, should be placed across R1 with the cathode connected to C1 as shown in Figure\xa05.\nReverse Input Protection\nA blocking diode is commonly employed when reverse input \npotential is possible, such as in automotive applications. This diode causes extra power loss, generates heat, and reduces the available supply voltage range. During cold crank, the extra voltage drop across the diode is partic -\nularly undesirable.\nThe L\nT4356 is designed to withstand reverse voltage \nwithout damage to itself or the load. The V CC, SNS, and \nSHDN pins can withstand up to 60V of DC voltage below \nthe GND potential. Back-to-back MOSFETs must be used to eliminate the current path through their body diodes (Figure\xa07). Figure\xa08 shows the approach with a P-Channel MOSFET in place of Q2.\nFigure\xa07.

With the negative input connected internally to the 1.25V reference, the am -\nplifier can be connected as a level detect comparator with external hysteresis. The open collector output pin, A\nOUT, \nis capable of driving an opto or LED. It can also interface with the system via a pull-up resistor to a supply voltage up to 80V . Another use is to implement undervoltage lockout, as shown in the typical application “Overvoltage Regulator with Undervoltage Lockout.” In shutdown, the auxiliary amplifier turns off in the L T4356-1 but continues operating in the L T4356-2.\nThe amplifier can also be configured as a low dropout \nlinear regulator controller . With an external PNP transistor , such as 2N2905A, it can supply up to 100mA of current with only a few hundred mV of dropout voltage. Current limit can be easily included by adding two diodes and one resistor (Figure\xa06).\nLT4356-1/LT4356-216\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nShutdown\nThe L T4356 can be shut down to a low current mode when \nthe voltage at the SHDN pin goes below the shutdown threshold of 0.6V . The quiescent current drops to 7µA for the L T4356-1 and 60µA for the L T4356-2 which leaves the auxiliary amplifier on.\nThe SHDN pin can be pulled up to V\nCC or below GND by \nup to 60V without damaging the pin. Leaving the pin open \nallows an internal current source to pull it up and turn on the part while clamping the pin to 2.5V . The leakage  \ncurrent at the pin should be limited to no more than 1µA if no pull up device is used to help turn it on.\nSupply T\nransient Protection\nThe L T4356 is guaranteed to be safe from damage with \nsupply voltages up to 100V . Nevertheless, voltage tran -\nsients above 100V may cause permanent damage. During a \nshort-circuit condition, the large change in current flowing \nthrough power supply traces and associated wiring can cause inductive voltage transients which could exceed 100V . To minimize the voltage transients, the power trace parasitic inductance should be minimized by using wide traces. A small surge suppressor , D2, in Figure\xa09, at the input will clamp the voltage spikes.A total bulk capacitance of at least 22µF low ESR electro -\nlytic is required close to the source pin of MOSFET Q1. In addition, the bulk capacitance should be at least 10 times larger than the total ceramic bypassing capacitor on the input of the DC/DC converter\n.Figure\xa08.

The minimum trace width for 1oz copper foil is 0.02" per amp to ensure the trace stays at a reasonable temperature. 0.03" per amp or wider is recommended. Note that 1oz copper exhibits a sheet resistance of about 530µ\nΩ/square. Small resistances can cause large errors in \nhigh current applications. Noise immunity will be improved significantly by locating resistive dividers close to the pins with short V\nCC and GND traces.\nDesign Example\nAs a design example, take an application with the following \nspecifications: V CC = 8V to 14V DC with transient up to 80V , \nVOUT ≤ 16V , current limit (I LIM) at 5A, low battery detection \nat 6V , and 1ms of overvoltage early warning (Figure\xa09).\nFirst, calculate the resistive divider value to limit V OUT to \n16V during an overvoltage event:\n  VREG=1.25V • R1 + R2 ( )\nR2=16V\nSet the current through R1 and R2 during the overvoltage \ncondition to 250µA.\n  R2 = 1.25V\n250µA = 5k\nChoose 4.99k for R2.\n  R1 = 16V – 1.25V( ) • R2\n1.25V = 58.88k\nThe closest standard value for R1 is 59k.\nNext calculate the sense resistor , R SNS, value:  RSNS = 50mV\nILIM = 50mV\n5A = 10m Ω\nCTMR is then chosen for 1ms of early warning time:\n  CTMR = 1ms • 5µA\n100mV = 50nF\nThe closest standard value for C TMR is 47nF .\nFinally, calculate R4 and R5 for the 6V low battery thresh -\nold detection:\n  6V = 1.25V • R4 + R5 ( )\nR5\nChoose 100k for R5.\n  R4 = 6V – 1.25V( )  • R5\n1.25V = 380k\nSelect 383k for R4.The pass transistor , Q1, should be chosen to withstand \nthe output short condition with V\nCC = 14V .\nThe total overcurrent fault time is:\n  tOC = 47nF • 0.85V\n45.5µA = 0.878ms\nThe power dissipation on Q1 equals to:\n  P = 14V • 50mV\n10m Ω = 70W\nThese conditions are well within the Safe Operating Area of IRLR2908.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT4356-1/LT4356-218\nRev.

#### Description:
The LT4356HMS-1#TRPBF is an overvoltage protection regulator designed to protect loads from high voltage transients. It operates by controlling the gate of an external N-channel MOSFET, regulating the output during overvoltage events, such as load dumps in automotive applications. The device monitors the voltage drop between its VCC and SNS pins to protect against overcurrent faults, with an internal amplifier limiting the current sense voltage to 50mV. 

#### Typical Applications:
- **Automotive/Avionic Surge Protection:** Protects sensitive electronic components from voltage spikes.
- **Hot Swap/Live Insertion:** Allows components to be added or removed without interrupting the power supply.
- **High Side Switch for Battery Powered Systems:** Controls power to loads while maintaining safety during voltage fluctuations.
- **Intrinsic Safety Applications:** Ensures safe operation in hazardous environments by preventing overvoltage conditions.

The LT4356H is particularly useful in applications requiring robust protection against voltage transients while maintaining operational continuity, making it ideal for automotive and industrial environments.
