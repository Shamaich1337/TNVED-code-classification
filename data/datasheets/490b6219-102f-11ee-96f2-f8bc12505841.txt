It has unity gain bandwidth of 140MHz and slew rate \nof 3 200V/μs. The MS8241 consumes only 7 mA supply current. In addition, it also has other perfect \ncharacteristics, such as ultra -low differential gain and differential phase and higher output current.  \nThe MS8241 is a voltage feedback amplifier (VFA) essentially. Two input terminals of VFA have \nhigh -impedance node, and it is differential from current feedback amplifier (CFA) with low inv erting input \nimpedance and high non- inverting input impedance. The low -impedance inverting input and feedback capacitor \nforms an additional pole, which would result in instability of whole loop. Therefore, CFA cannot be used in \ntraditional operational ampl ifier circuit, such as photodiode amplifier, current -to-voltage converter and \nintegrator, which don ’t need feedback capacitor.  \nThe MS8241 is fully symmetric structure and has the high -speed characteristic similar to CFA. AB class output \nstage isolates the gain stage from load in order to provide lower output impedance.  \n \nSlew Rate \nThe slew rate of MS8241 is determined by the current available to charge and discharge the high - impedance \nnode capacitor. This current equals to the differential input voltage divided by the total degeneration resistor RE. Therefore, slew rate is proporti onal to input voltage. And the higher slew rate can also be achieved in the low \nloop gain configurations.  \nWhen a high- speed large signal pulse is input to amplifier, a certain extent of overshoot or undershoot would \noccur. Place an 1k Ω external resistor i n series with input pin, and bandwidth is reduced to decrease the \novershoot.  \nIf input signal has large magnitude in high frequency, the slew rate of amplifier would be limited, which \nwould lead to the oscillation in time domain and the peak in frequency do main.  \nWhen gain is +4, no peak occurs. So the MS8241 can make ideal response to input signals of 30mV , 100mV \nand 300mV . \nWhen gain is +2, slight peak occurs. The high -frequency peak appears because input signal exceeds slew rate \nof amplifier in high -frequen cy. The peak in frequency domain cannot limit the pulse response in time domain. \nThe MS8241 can operate stably when noise gain is more than +2.  \n \nInput Capacitance Compensation  \nThe input capacitance and gain setting resistor would form an additional pole, w hich would result in peak \nand oscillation. In order to solve this problem, a feedback capacitor C F can be used, the value is: C F > (R IN × \nCIN)/R F.  \nThis capacitor can cancel the pole on input terminal and the recommended value is 2pF. The compensation \ncircuit is shown as follows.  \n \n \nHangzhou Ruimeng Technology Co.,L td              VERSION : V1. 2                          2 023.01.12   \nhttp://www.relmon.com                                                                     - PAGE 8 -  MS8241  \nMS8241RFCF\nRIN\nCINVIN\nVOUT\n \n \nPower Caution  \nSetting a reasonable bypass network can reduce the power supply impedance in full frequency band. A \n0.01μ F ceramic capacitor and a 2.2μ F tantalum capacitor should be individually placed on positive and negative \npower supplies and they should be close to power supply pin.  \nMS82412.2μF\n2.2μF0.01μF\n0.01μFVCC\nVEE  \n \nInput Limit  \nIn high -frequency application, if signal is not terminated properly, reflex wo uld be produced.  \nIn order to reduce reflex, the coaxial cable with impedance match can be used at signal source. The other \nend of cable should use the same value of resistor or limitator. In common cable, RG59 has 75Ω characteristic \nimpedance and RG 58 has 50 Ω characteristic impedance.  \n \nDrive Capacitive Load  \nAmplifier driving capacitive load would generate oscillation on output terminal. To avoid this situation, an \nisolation resistor can be placed as shown below. The isolation resistor and load capacitor form a pole to \nincreasing phase margin and improving the instability of whole system. The response of whole system is decided by isolation resistor: the larger the isolation resistor, the weaker the pulse response. For the MS8241,  \n50Ω isolation resistor is recommended. The figure below shows the MS8241 driving a 150pF load using 50Ω  \nisolation resistor.  \nMS8241510Ω\nVINVOUTRISO\nCL510Ω\n \n \n \nHangzhou Ruimeng Technology Co.,L td              VERSION : V1. 2                          2 023.01.12   \nhttp://www.relmon.com                                                                     - PAGE 9 -  MS8241  \nPower Dissipation  \nMaximum Power Dissipation: PD = (T J(MAX) - TA) / RθJA \nPD  is the power dissipation, TJ(MAX)  is the maximum junction temperature, TA is ambient temperature and RθJA \nis thermal resistor of specified package.  \nFor example, for SOP8 package, the maximum power dissipation is 730mW  in 25° C ambient temperature.  \nTotal Power Dissipation: P D = P Q + P L。 \nPQ is the quiescent power dissipation when there is no load on the output terminal. P L is the power \ndissipation when there is a load on the output terminal, rather than load power dissipation. In addition, P Q \nequals to the product of quiescent current and tota l power supply voltage. P L equals to output current \nmultiplied by the voltage difference between power supply voltage and output voltage .  \nFor example, when VS=±5V , 1kΩ load, 10V output voltage, the total power dissipation of the MS8241 is:  \nPD = P Q + P L = 6.5mA × 30V + 10mA × (15V - 10V) = 195mW + 50mW = 245mW  \nPCB Layout Guide  \nWhen designing PCB for high -speed operational amplifier,  there are many things to consider and deign layout \nneeds full carefulness. Otherwise it is very easy to oscillate and the AC performance would be decreased in \nhigh -speed system.  \nThe fist is the signal trace should be short and wide to provide lower inductance and impedance. Any unused \nboard space should be grounded to reduce stray signal interference. Critical components should have a \ncommon ground point to reduce voltage drop. Socket increases parasitic capacitance to the board and high -frequency characteristic would be affected. Therefore It is better to solder the amplifier directly into PCB  \nwithout socket.  \nActive probe i s suitable for high -frequency measurement because it has wider bandwidth, higher input \nimpedance and low input capacitance. However, the ground lead of probe would produce a long ground loop and would lead to measurement error. So remove the ground lead an d probe jacket directly and use probe jack.  \nIt is very important to remain short trace in high -speed circuit. Discrete component should select carbon \ncomposition -type resistor and mica -type capacitor. Using surface -mount component can reduce inductive effe ct \ncompared to discrete component.  \nLarge feedback resistor would couple with parasitic capacitance and cause undesirable oscillation and ringing  \nFor the MS8241, a feedback resistor of 510Ω  is more suitable.  \n \n \n  \n \n \nHangzhou Ruimeng Technology Co.,L td              VERSION : V1. 2                          2 023.01.12   \nhttp://www.relmon.com                                                                     - PAGE 10 -  MS8241  \nTYPICAL APPLICATION DIAGRAM  \nMultivibrator                                    Pulse Width Modulator  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFast-speed Instrumentation Amplifier                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVideo Line Driver  \n \n  MS8241\nMS8241MS8241V1\nV2R5 R7R2 R6\nR1\n510Ω\nR3\n510Ω\nR4\n510Ω1kΩ\n1kΩ1kΩ\n1kΩMS8241C\nVOUT\nR2\n510ΩR1\n510Ω\n510ΩR3MS8241VOUT\nR2\n510ΩR1\n510Ω\n510ΩR3VINR4\n510Ω\nMS8241 VOUT510Ω\n510Ω\n75Ω75Ω 75ΩCABLE\n75Ω\n75Ω 75ΩCABLE\n75Ω75ΩCABLE\nVIN\nVOUT\n \n \nHangzhou Ruimeng Technology Co.,L td              VERSION : V1. 2                          2 023.01.12   \nhttp://www.relmon.com                                                                     - PAGE 11 -  MS8241  \nPACKAGE OUTLINE DIMENSIONS  \nSOP8  \n \nD\nE1 E\nAe\nb\nA1\nA2Lθ\nc\n \nSymbol  Dimensions in Millimeters  Dimensions in Inches  \nMin Max  Min Max  \nA 1.350  1.750  0.053  0.069  \nA1 0.100  0.250  0.004  0.010  \nA2 1.350  1.550  0.053  0.061  \nb 0.330  0.510  0.013  0.020  \nc 0.170  0.250  0.006  0.010  \nD 4.700  5.100  0.185  0.200  \nE 3.800  4.000  0.150  0.157  \nE1 5.800  6.200  0.228  0.244  \ne 1.27 BSC 0.050 BSC  \nL 0.400  1.270  0.016  0.050  \nθ 0 º 8 º 0 º 8 º \n  \n \n \nHangzhou Ruimeng Technology Co.,L td              VERSION : V1. 2                          2 023.01.12   \nhttp://www.relmon.com                                                                     - PAGE 12 -  MS8241  \nMSOP8  \nE1 E\nA\nDb\ne\nA1\nA2Lc\nθ\n \nSymbol  Dimensions in Millimeters  Dimensions in Inches  \nMin Max  Min Max  \nA 0.820  1.100  0.032  0.043  \nA1 0.020  0.150  0.001  0.006  \nA2 0.750  0.950  0.030  0.037  \nb 0.250  0.380  0.010  0.015  \nc 0.090  0.230  0.004  0.009  \nD 2.900  3.100  0.114  0.122  \nE 2.900  3.100  0.114  0.122  \nE1 4.750  5.050  0.187  0.199  \ne 0.650BSC  0.026BSC  \nL 0.400  0.800  0.016  0.031  \nθ 0º 6º 0º 6º \n \n \n \nHangzhou Ruimeng Technology Co.,L td              VERSION : V1. 2                          2 023.01.12   \nhttp://www.relmon.com                                                                     - PAGE 13 -  MS8241  \nMARKING and PACKAGING SPECIFICATIONS                                                        \n1.
