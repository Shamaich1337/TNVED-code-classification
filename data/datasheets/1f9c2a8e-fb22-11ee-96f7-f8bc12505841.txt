All VDDs \nmust be connected to desired supply voltage to trigger POR. \nUser can define specific default configurations through internal \nOne-Time-Programmable (OTP) memory. Either customer or \nfactory can program the default configuration. Please refer to \nVersaClock 6E Family Register Descriptions and Programming \nGuide  for details or contact Renesas if a specific \nfactory-programmed default configuration is required.\nDevice will identity which of the 2 modes to operate in by the state \nof OUT0_SEL_I2CB pin at POR. Both of the 2 modes default \nconfigurations can be programmed as stated above.\n1.Software Mode (I2C): OUT0_SEL_I2CB is low at POR. \nI2C interface will be open to users for in-system programming, \noverriding device default configurations at any time. \n2.Hardware Select Mode : OUT0_SEL_I2CB is high at POR.\nDevice has been programmed to load OTP at power-up \n(REG0[7]=1). The device will load internal registers according \nto Table 19. Power-up Behavior .\nInternal OTP memory can support up to 4 configurations, \nselectable by SEL0/SEL1 pins.\nAt POR, logic levels at SEL0 and SEL1 pins must be settled, \nresulting the selected configuration to be loaded at power up.\nAfter the first 10ms of operation, the levels of the SELx pins \ncan be changed, either to low or to the same level as \nVDDD/VDDA. The SELx pins must be driven with a digital signal \nof < 300ns rise/fall time and only a single pin can be changed \nat a time. After a pin level change, the device must not be \ninterrupted for at least 1ms so that the new values have time to \nload and take effect.Reference Clock and Selection\nThe device supports up to two clock inputs. \n▪Crystal input, can be driven by a single-ended clock.\n▪Clock input (CLKIN, CLKINB), a fully differential input that only \naccepts a reference clock. A single-ended clock can also drive \nit on CLKIN.\nFigure 7.

In this mode, CLKSEL pin is used to switch \nbetween the primary and secondary clock sources. The PRIMSRC \nbit determines the primary and secondary clock source setting. \nDuring the switchover, no glitches will occur at the output of the \ndevice, although there may be frequency and phase drift, \ndepending on the exact phase and frequency relationship \nbetween the primary and secondary clocks.Table 19.

When the \noscillator load capacitance matches the crystal load capacitance, \nthe oscillation frequency will be accurate. When the oscillator load \ncapacitance is lower than the crystal load capacitance, the \noscillation frequency will be higher than nominal and vice versa so \nfor an accurate oscillation frequency you need to make sure to \nmatch the oscillator load capacitance with the crystal load \ncapacitance.\nTuning the Crystal Load Capacitor\nCs1 and Cs2 are stray capacitances at each crystal pin and \ntypical values are between 1pF and 3pF.\nCe1 and Ce2 are additional external capacitors, increasing the \nload capacitance reduces the oscillator gain so please consult the \nfactory when adding Ce1 and/or Ce2 to avoid crystal startup \nissues. Ci1 and Ci2 are integrated programmable load capacitors, \none at XIN and one at XOUT. Ci1 and Ci2. \nThe value of each capacitor is composed of a fixed capacitance \namount plus a variable capacitance amount set with the XTAL[5:0] \nregister. Ci1 and Ci2 are commonly programmed to be the same value. \nAdjustment of the crystal tuning capacitors allows maximum \nflexibility to accommodate crystals from various manufacturers. \nThe range of tuning capacitor values available are in accordance \nwith the following table.\nCi1/Ci2 starts at 9pF with setting 000000b and can be increased \nup to 25pF with setting 111111b. The step per bit is 0.5pF.\nYou can write the following equation for this capacitance:\nCi = 9pF + 0.5pF × XTAL[5:0]\nCXIN = Ci1 + Cs1 + Ce1\nCXOUT  = Ci2 + Cs2 + Ce2\nThe final load capacitance of the crystal:\nCL = CXIN × CXOUT  / (CXIN + CXOUT )\nIt is recommended to set the same value for capacitors the same \nat each crystal pin, meaning:\nCXIN = CXOUT\nExample 1 : The crystal load capacitance is specified as 8pF and \nthe stray capacitance at each crystal pin is Cs = 1.5pF. Assuming \nequal capacitance value at XIN and XOUT, the equation is as \nfollows:\n8pF = (9pF + 0.5pF × XTAL[5:0] + 1.5pF) / 2\nSo, XTAL[5:0] = 11 (decimal).\nExample 2 : The crystal load capacitance is specified as 12pF and \nthe stray capacitance Cs is unknown. Footprints for external \ncapacitors Ce are added and a worst case Cs of 5pF is used. For \nnow we use Cs + Ce = 5pF and the right value for Ce can be \ndetermined later to make 5pF together with Cs.\n12pF = (9pF + 0.5pF × XTAL[5:0] + 5pF) / 2\nSo, XTAL[5:0] = 20 (decimal).\nTable 21.

Each of the \nFODs are comprised of a 12-bit integer counter, and a 24-bit \nfractional counter. The output divider can operate in integer divide \nonly mode for improved performance, or utilize the fractional \ncounters to generate a clock frequency accurate to 50ppb. \nFOD has the following features:\nIndividual Spread Spectrum Modulation\nThe output clock frequencies can be modulated to spread energy \nacross a broader range of frequencies, lowering system EMI. \nEach divider has individual spread ability. Spread modulation \nindependent of output frequency, a triangle wave modulation \nbetween 30 and 63kHz.\nSpread spectrum can be applied to any output clock, any clock \nfrequency, and any spread amount from ±0.25% to ±2.5% \ncenter-spread and -0.5% to -5% down-spread. \nBypass Mode\nBypass mode (divide by 1) to allow the output to behave as a \nbuffered copy from the input or another FOD.\nCascaded Mode \nAs shown in the block diagram, FODs can be cascaded for lower \noutput frequency.\nFor example, user currently has OUT1 running at 12.288MHz and \nneeds another 48kHz output. The user can cascade FOD2 by \ntaking input from OUT1, with a divide ratio of 256. In this way, \nOUT 2 is running at 48kHz while in alignment with 12.288MHz on \nOUT1.\nDividers Alignment\nEach output divider block has a synchronizing pulse to provide \nstartup alignment between outputs dividers. This allows alignment \nof outputs for low skew performance. When device is at hardware select mode outputs will be \nautomatically aligned at POR. The same synchronization reset is \nalso triggered when switching between configurations with the \nSEL0/1 pins. This ensures that the outputs remain aligned in \nevery configuration. \nWhen using software mode I2C to reprogram an output divider \nduring operation, alignment can be lost. Alignment can be \nrestored by manually triggering the reset through I2C.\nThe outputs are aligned on the falling edges of each output by \ndefault. Rising edge alignment can also be achieved by utilizing \nthe programmable skew feature to delay the faster clock by 180 \ndegrees. The programmable skew feature also allows for fine \ntuning of the alignment.\nProgrammable Skew\nThe device has the ability to skew outputs by quadrature values. \nThe skew on each output can be adjusted from 0 to 360 degrees. \nSkew is adjusted in units equal to 1/32 of the VCO period. So, for \n100MHz output and a 2800MHz VCO, you can select how many \n11.161ps units you want added to your skew (resulting in units of \n0.402 degrees). For example, 0, 0.402, 0.804, 1.206, 1.408, and \nso on. The granularity of the skew adjustment is always \ndependent on the VCO period and the output period.\nOutput Drivers\nThe device output drivers support the following features \nindividually:\n▪2.5V or 3.3V voltage level for HCSL/LVPECL operation\n▪1.8V, 2.5V or 3.3V voltage levels for CMOS/LVDS operation\n▪CMOS supports 4 operating modes:\n•CMOSD: OUTx and OUTxB 180 degrees out of phase\n•CMOSX2: OUTx and OUTxB phase-aligned\n•CMOS1: only OUTx pin is on\n•CMOS2: only OUTxB pin is on\nWhen a given output is configured to at CMOSD or CMOSX2, then \nall previously described configuration and control apply equally to \nboth pins. \n▪Independent output enable/disabled by register bits. When \ndisabled, an output can be either in a logic 1 state or Hi-Z.\nThe following options are used to disable outputs:\n1.Output turned off by I2C. \n2.Output turned off by SD/OE pin.\n3.Output unused, which means is turned off regardless of OE pin \nstatus.Table 23.

User will \nhave the option to choose output driver behavior when it's off:\n1.OUTx pin high, OUTxB pin low. (Controlled by SD/OE pin).\n2.OUTx/OUTxB Hi-Z (Controlled by SD/OE pin).\n3.OUTx pin high, OUTxB pin low. (Configured through I2C).\n4.OUTx/OUTxB Hi-Z (Configured by I2C).\nThe user has the option to disable the output with either I2C or \nSD/OE pin. Refer to VersaClock 6E Family Register Descriptions \nand Programming Guide  for details.I2C Operation\nThe device acts as a slave device on the I2C bus using one of the \ntwo I2C addresses (0xD0 or 0xD4) to allow multiple devices to be \nused in the system. The interface accepts byte-oriented block \nwrite and block read operations.\nAddress bytes(2 bytes) specify the register address of the byte \nposition of the first register to write or read. \nData bytes (registers) are accessed in sequential order from the \nlowest to the highest byte (most significant bit first). \nRead and write block transfers can be stopped after any complete \nbyte transfer. During a write operation, data will not be moved into \nthe registers until the STOP bit is received, at which point, all data \nreceived in the block write will be written simultaneously.\nFor full electrical I2C compliance, use external pull-up resistors for \nSDATA and SCLK. \nFigure 8.

The \nXOUT pin can be left floating. \nFigure 10.  Overdriving XIN with a CMOS Driver\nDriving XIN with an LVPECL Driver\nFigure 11 shows an example of the interface diagram for a +3.3V LVPECL driver. This is a standard LVPECL termination with one side of \nthe driver feeding the XIN/REF input. It is recommended that all components in the schematics be placed in the layout; though some \ncomponents might not be used, they can be utilized for debugging purposes. The datasheet specifications are characterized and \nguaranteed by using a quartz crystal as the input. If the driver is 2.5V LVPECL, the only change necessary is to use the appropriate value \nof R3.\nFigure 11.  Overdriving XIN with an LVPECL DriverTable 24.

However, it is internally AC coupled so it is able \nto accept both LVDS and LVPECL input signals. \nOccasionally, it is desired to have CLKIN to take CMOS levels. Below is an example showing how this can be achieved. \nThis configuration has three properties:\n1.Total output impedance of Ro and Rs matches the 50 Ω transmission line impedance.\n2.Vrx voltage is generated at the CLKIN which maintains the LVCMOS driver voltage level across the transmission line for best S/N.\n3.R1–R2 voltage divider values ensure that Vrx p-p at CLKIN is less than the maximum value of 1.2V.\nFigure 12.  Recommended Schematic for Driving CLKIN with LVCMOS Driver\nTable 25 shows resistor values that ensure the maximum drive level for the CLKIN port is not exceeded for all combinations of 5% \ntolerance on the driver VDD, VDDO0  and 5% resistor tolerances. The values of the resistors can be adjusted to reduce the loading for \nslower and weaker LVCMOS driver by increasing the impedance of the R1–R2 divider. To better assist this assessment, the total load \n(Ro + Rs + R1 + R2) on the driver is included in the table.\nDriving CLKIN with Differential Clock\nCLKIN/CLKINB will accept DC coupled HCSL/LVPECL/LVDS signals.\nFigure 13.

The actual value \nshould be selected to match the differential impedance (Zo) of your transmission line. A typical point-to-point LVDS design uses a 100 Ω \nparallel resistor at the receiver and a 100 Ω. differential transmission-line environment. In order to avoid any transmission-line reflection \nissues, the components should be surface mounted and must be placed as close to the receiver as possible. The standard termination \nschematic as shown in figure Standard Termination  or the termination of figure Optional Termination  can be used, which uses a center tap \ncapacitance to help filter common mode noise. The capacitor value should be approximately 50pF. In addition, since these outputs are \nLVDS compatible, the input receiver's amplitude and common-mode input range should be verified for compatibility with the Renesas \nLVDS output. If using a non-standard termination, it is recommended to contact Renesas and confirm that the termination will function as \nintended. \nFigure 14.

Therefore, terminating resistors (DC current path to ground) or \ncurrent sources must be used for functionality. These outputs are designed to drive 50 Ω transmission lines. Matched impedance \ntechniques should be used to maximize operating frequency and minimize signal distortion. \nFor VDDO = 2.5V, the VDDO - 2V is very close to ground level.
