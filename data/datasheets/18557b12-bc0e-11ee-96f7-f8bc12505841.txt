In this case, the 5 V power supply provides the 3.3 V power \nrequired by the microcontrollers and peripherals by means of the 3.3 V voltage regulator (U2) on \nthe board.  \nThe 5 V pin of J4 or J7 can also be used as an input power source. The AT -START -F415 board \nmust be powered by a 5 V power supply unit.  \nThe 3.3 V pin of J4 or th e VDD pin of J1 and J2 can also be directly used as 3.3 V input power \nsupply. AT -START -F415 board must be powered by a 3.3 V power supply unit.  \nNote:  Unless 5 V is provided through the USB connector (CN6) on the AT-Link-EZ, the AT-Link-EZ will \nnot be powered by other power supply methods.  \nWhen another application board is connected to J4, the VIN  pin, 5 V and 3.3 V can be used as \noutput power; J7 5V  pin used as 5 V output power; the VDD  pin of J1 and J2 used as 3.3 V output \npower.  \n \n3.2 IDD \nIn the event of  JP3 OFF  (symbol IDD) and R13 OFF , it is allowed to connect an ammeter to \nmeasure the power consumption of AT32 F415RCT7 -7. \n\uf06c JP3 OFF , R13 ON:   \nAT32 F415RCT7 -7 is powered. (Default setting  and JP3 plug is not mounted  before shipping )  \n\uf06c JP3 ON , R13 OFF:  \nAT32 F415RCT7 -7 is powered.  \n\uf06c JP3 OFF , R13 OFF:   \nAn ammeter must be connected to measure the power consumption of AT32 F415RCT7 -7 (if \nthere is no ammeter, the AT32 F415RCT7 -77 cannot be powered).   \nAT-START -F415  User M anual  \n2020.11.19  10 Rev 1.0 \n3.3 Programming and debugging  \n3.3.1  Embedded AT-LINK -EZ \nThe evaluation board embeds Artery AT-Link-EZ programming and debugging tool for users to \nprogram/debug the AT32F415RCT7 -7 on the AT -START -F415 board. AT-Link-EZ supports SWD \ninterface mode and supports a set o f virtual COM  ports (VCP)  to connect to the \nUSART1 _TX/USART1_RX (PA9/PA10)  of AT32F415RCT7 -7. In this case, PA9 and PA10 of \nAT32F415RCT7 -7 will be affected by AT-Link-EZ as follows:   \n\uf06c PA9 is weakly pulled up to high level by the VCP RX pin of AT -Link-EZ; \n\uf06c PA10 is strongly pulled up  to high level by the VCP TX pin of AT -Link-EZ \nThe u ser can set R9 or R10 OFF, then the use of PA9 and PA10 of AT32F415RCT7 -7 is not \nsubject to the above restrictions.  \nThe SWO debug port of AT-Link-EZ is connected to the TRACESWO (PB3) of AT32F415RCT7 -7 \nvia R53, and it is set in a floating state when the SWO debug function is disabled, which will not \naffect the use of PB3 by AT32F415RCT7 -7. If you have other concerns, set R53 OFF.  \nPlease refer to AT-Link User M anua l for complete details on the operations, firmware upgrade and \nprecautions of AT-Link-EZ. \nThe AT-Link-EZ PCB on the evaluation board can be separate d from AT -START -F415  by bending \nover along the joint . In this case, AT -START -F415 can still be connected to the CN7 of AT-Link-EZ \nthrough CN2 (not mounted before shipping ), or can be connected with another AT -Link to continue \nthe programming and debugging on the AT32F415RCT7 -7. \n3.3.2  20-pin ARM® standard JTAG connector  \nAT-START -F415 also reserves JTAG  or SWD general -purpose connectors as \nprogramming/debugging tools. If users want to use this interface to program and debug the \nAT32F415RCT7 -7, please seperate  the AT-Link-EZ from this board or set R41, R44  and R46 OFF, \nand connect the CN3  (not mounted before shipping ) to the  programming and debugging tool .  \n3.4 Boot mode selection  \nAt startup, three different boot modes can be selected by means of the pin configuration.  \nTable 1.

In device mode,  AT32F415RCT7 -\n7 can be directly connected to the host through USB micro -B, and VBUS can be used as 5 V power \nsupply  of AT-START -F415  board; In host mode , an external USB OTG cable is required to connect \nto the device, and it controls the power supply of USB micro -B connector  to the device by \ncontrolling  the transistor S8550 through  a PD2 port.  \nIn addition, AT-START -F415  board also has an  additional USB type A connector  (CN1), which is \nan USB host connector  mainly for connecting to U disk and other devices without the need of USB  \nOTG cable.
