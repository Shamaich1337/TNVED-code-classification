SWITCHES SHOWN FOR A 1 INPUT LOGIC.  \nFigure 2. 16-Lead LFCSP \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADG1636  is a monolithic CMOS device containing two \nindependently selectable single-pole/double-throw (SPDT) \nswitches. An EN input is used to enable or disable the device. When disabled, all channels are switched off. Each switch conducts equally well in both directions when on and has an input signal \nrange that extends to the supplies. In the off condition, signal \nlevels up to the supplies are blocked. Both switches exhibit break-before-make switching action for use in multiplexer \napplications.  \nThe ultralow on resistance of these switches make them ideal \nsolutions for data acquisition and gain switching applications where low on resistance and distortion is critical. The on resistance profile \nis very flat over the full analog input range, ensuring excellent \nlinearity and low distortion when switching audio signals. The CMOS construction ensures ultralow power dissipation, \nmaking the devices ideally suited for portable and battery-\npowered instruments. \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. 1.6 Ω maximum on resistance over temperature. \n2. Minimum distortion: THD + N = 0.007%. \n3. 3 V logic-compatible digital inputs: V INH = 2.0 V , V INL = 0.8 V . \n4. No V L logic power supply required. \n5. Ultralow power dissipation: <16 nW . \n6. 16-lead TSSOP and 16-lead 4 mm × 4 mm LFCSP . \n \n  \n \n \nADG1636 Data Sheet \n \nRev.
