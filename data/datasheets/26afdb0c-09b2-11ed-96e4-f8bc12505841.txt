A unique, current-limited,pulse-frequency-modulated (PFM) control scheme com-bines the benefits of traditional PFM converters with thebenefits of pulse-width-modulated (PWM) converters.Like PWM converters, the MAX764/MAX765/MAX766 arehighly efficient at heavy loads. Yet because they are PFMdevices, they use less than 120µA of supply current (vs.2mA to 10mA for a PWM device).\nThe input voltage range is 3V to 16V. The output volt-\nage is preset at -5V (MAX764), -12V (MAX765), or -15V(MAX766); it can also be adjusted from -1V to -16Vusing two external resistors (Dual Mode\nTM). The maxi-\nmum operating V IN- VOUTdifferential is 20V.\nThese devices use miniature external components; their\nhigh switching frequencies (up to 300kHz) allow for lessthan 5mm diameter surface-mount magnetics. A stan-dard 47µH inductor is ideal for most applications, so nomagnetics design is necessary.\nAn internal power MOSFET makes the MAX764/MAX765/\nMAX766 ideal for minimum component count, low- andmedium-power applications. For increased output drivecapability or higher output voltages, use theMAX774/MAX775/MAX776 or MAX1774, which drive anexternal power P-channel MOSFET for loads up to 5W.\n________________________Applications\nLCD-Bias Generators\nPortable InstrumentsLAN AdaptersRemote Data-Acquisition SystemsBattery-Powered Applications____________________________Features\n\'High Efficiency for a Wide Range of Load Currents\n\'250mA Output Current\n\'120µA Max Supply Current\n\'5µA Max Shutdown Current\n\'3V to 16V Input Voltage Range\n\'-5V (MAX764), -12V (MAX765), -15V (MAX766), \nor Adjustable Output from -1V to -16V\n\'Current-Limited PFM Control Scheme\n\'300kHz Switching Frequency\n\'Internal, P-Channel Power MOSFET\n______________Ordering Information\nOrdering Information continued on last page.\n*  Dice are tested at T A= +25°C, DC parameters only.\n**Contact factory for availability and processing to MIL-STD-883.\nMAX764/MAX765/MAX766-5V/-12V/-15V or Adjustable,\nHigh-Efficiency, Low I QDC-DC Inverters\n________________________________________________________________ Maxim Integrated Products 11\n23\n48\n7\n6\n5LX\nV+\nV+\nGND REFSHDNFBOUT\nMAX764\r\nMAX765\r\nMAX766\nDIP/SOTOP VIEW__________________Pin Configuration\nGNDMAX764\nSHDNLX\nOUTON/OFF\nREF47µHOUTPUT\r\n-5VINPUT\r\n3V TO 15V\nV+\nFB__________Typical Operating Circuit\nCall toll free 1-800-998-8800 for free samples or literature.19-0176; Rev 0; 6/94\nPART\nMAX764 CPA\nMAX764CSA\nMAX764C/D 0°C to +70°C0°C to +70°C0°C to +70°CTEMP.

Their unique control scheme combinesthe advantages of pulse-frequency modulation (pulseskipping) and pulse-width modulation (continuous puls-ing).  The internal P-channel power MOSFET allowspeak currents of 0.75A, increasing the output currentcapability over previous pulse-frequency-modulation(PFM) devices.  Figure 1 shows the MAX764/MAX765/MAX766 block diagram.\nThe MAX764/MAX765/MAX766 offer three main\nimprovements over prior solutions: 1) They can operate with miniature (less than 5mm\ndiameter) surface-mount inductors, because of their300kHz switching frequency.\n2) The current-limited PFM control scheme allows efficien-\ncies exceeding 80% over a wide range of load currents.\n3) Maximum quiescent supply current is only 120µA.Figures 2 and  3 show the standard application circuits\nfor these devices.  In these configurations, the IC ispowered from the total differential voltage between theinput (V+) and output (V\nOUT).  The principal benefit of\nthis arrangement is that it applies the largest availablesignal to the gate of the internal P-channel power MOS-FET.  This increased gate drive lowers switch on-resis-tance and increases DC-DC converter efficiency.\nSince the voltage on the LX pin swings from V+ (when the\nswitch is ON) to \nIVOUTIplus a diode drop (when theMAX764\r\nMAX765\r\nMAX766\nP\nTRIG Q\nONE-SHOTTRIG Q\nONE-SHOT\nS\nRQ\nCURRENT\r\nCONTROL CIRCUITS1.5V\r\nREFERENCEN\nFROM OUTFROM V+\nFROM V+0.1V\r\n(HALF\rCURRENT)0.2V\r\n(FULL\r\nCURRENT)\nGNDLXV+OUT\nV+REF\nSHDN ERROR\r\nCOMPARATORCOMPARATOR\nCURRENT\r\nCOMPARATORFB\nFigure 1.  Block Diagram\nswitch is OFF), the range of input and output voltages is\nlimited to a 21V absolute maximum differential voltage.\nWhen output voltages more negative than -16V are\nrequired, substitute the MAX764/MAX765/MAX766 withMaxim’s MAX774/MAX775/MAX776 or MAX1774, whichuse an external switch.PFM Control Scheme\nThe MAX764/MAX765/MAX766 use a proprietary, cur-rent-limited PFM control scheme that blends the bestfeatures of PFM and PWM devices.  It combines theultra-low supply currents of traditional pulse-skippingPFM converters with the high full-load efficiencies ofcurrent-mode pulse-width modulation (PWM) convert-ers.  This control scheme allows the devices to achievehigh efficiencies over a wide range of loads, while thecurrent-sense function and high operating frequencyallow the use of  miniature external components.  \nAs with traditional PFM converters, the internal power\nMOSFET is turned on when the voltage comparatorsenses that the output is out of regulation (Figure 1).However, unlike traditional PFM converters, switching isaccomplished through the combination of a peak cur-rent limit and a pair of one-shots that set the maximumon-time (16µs) and minimum off-time (2.3µs) for theswitch.  Once off, the minimum off-time one-shot holdsthe switch off for 2.3µs.  After this minimum time, theswitch either 1)  stays off if the output is in regulation, or2) turns on again if the output is out of regulation.\nThe MAX764/MAX765/MAX766 limit the peak inductor\ncurrent, which allows them to run in continuous-con-duction mode and maintain high efficiency with heavyloads.  (See the photo Continuous Conduction at FullCurrent Limit in the \nTypical Operating Characteristics .)\nThis current-limiting feature is a key component of thecontrol circuitry.  Once turned on, the switch stays onuntil either 1) the maximum on-time one shot turns it off(16µs later), or 2) the current limit is reached.\nTo increase light-load efficiency, the current limit is set to\nhalf the peak current limit for the first two pulses.  If thosepulses bring the output voltage into regulation, the volt-age comparator holds the MOSFET off and the currentlimit remains at half the peak current limit.  If the outputvoltage is still out of regulation after two pulses, the cur-rent limit is raised to its 0.75A peak for the next pulse.(See the photo Discontinuous Conduction at Half and FullCurrent Limit in the \nTypical Operating Characteristics .)\nShutdown Mode\nWhen SHDN is high, the MAX764/MAX765/MAX766enter a shutdown mode in which the supply currentdrops to less than 5µA.  In this mode, the internal biasingcircuitry (including the reference) is turned off and OUTdischarges to ground.  SHDN is a TTL/CMOS-logic levelinput.  Connect SHDN to GND for normal operation.With a current-limited supply, power-up the device whileunloaded or in shutdown mode (hold SHDN high until V+exceeds 3.0V) to save power and reduce power-up cur-rent surges.

Adjustable Output Voltage Operation\nMAX764/MAX765/MAX766Modes of Operation\nWhen delivering high output currents, the MAX764/\nMAX765/MAX766 operate in continuous-conductionmode.  In this mode, current always flows in the induc-tor, and the control circuit adjusts the duty-cycle of theswitch on a cycle-by-cycle basis to maintain regulationwithout exceeding the switch-current capability.  Thisprovides excellent load-transient response and highefficiency.\nIn discontinuous-conduction mode, current through the\ninductor starts at zero, rises to a peak value, thenramps down to zero on each cycle.  Although efficiencyis still excellent, the output ripple may increase slightly.\n__________________Design Procedure\nSetting the Output Voltage \nThe MAX764/MAX765/MAX766’s output voltage can beadjusted from -1.0V to -16V using external resistors R1and R2, configured as shown in Figure 3.  Foradjustable-output operation, select feedback resistorR1 = 150k Ω.  R2 is given by:\nV\nOUTR2 = (R1) I——— I VREF\nwhere V REF= 1.5V.\nFor fixed-output operation, tie FB to REF. \nInductor Selection\nIn both continuous- and discontinuous-conduction\nmodes, practical inductor values range from 22µH to68µH.  If the inductor value is too low, the current in thecoil will ramp up to a high level before the current-limitcomparator can turn off the switch, wasting power andreducing efficiency.  The maximum inductor value is notcritical.  A 47µH inductor is ideal for most applications.\nFor highest efficiency, use a coil with low DC resis-\ntance, preferably under 100m Ω.  To minimize radiated\nnoise, use a toroid,  pot core, or  shielded coil.Inductors with a ferrite core or equivalent are recom-mended.  The inductor’s incremental saturation-currentrating should be greater than the 0.75A peak currentlimit.  It is generally acceptable to bias the inductor intosaturation by approximately 20% (the point where theinductance is 20% below the nominal value).\nTable 1 lists inductor types and suppliers for various\napplications.  The listed surface-mount inductors’ effi-ciencies are nearly equivalent to those of the larger-size through-hole inductors.Diode Selection\nThe MAX764/MAX765/MAX766’s high switching fre-quency demands a high-speed rectifier.  Use aSchottky diode with a 0.75A average current rating,such as the 1N5817 or 1N5818.  High leakage currentsmay make Schottky diodes inadequate for high-temper-ature and light-load applications.  In these cases youcan use high-speed silicon diodes, such as theMUR105 or the EC11FS1.  At heavy loads and hightemperatures, the benefits of a Schottky diode’s low for-ward voltage may outweigh the disadvantages of itshigh leakage current.\nCapacitor Selection \nOutput Filter Capacitor\nThe primary criterion for selecting the output filtercapacitor (C4) is low effective series resistance (ESR).The product of the inductor-current variation and theoutput filter capacitor’s ESR determines the amplitudeof the high-frequency ripple seen on the output voltage.A 68µF, 20V Sanyo OS-CON capacitor with ESR =45mΩ(SA series) typically provides 50mV ripple when\nconverting from 5V to -5V at 150mA.  \nOutput filter capacitor ESR also affects efficiency.  To\nobtain optimum performance, use a 68µF or larger,low-ESR capacitor with a voltage rating of at least20V.  The smallest low-ESR surface-mount tantalumcapacitors currently available are from the Sprague595D series.  Sanyo OS-CON series organic semi-conductors and AVX TPS series tantalum capacitorsalso exhibit very low ESR.  OS-CON capacitors areparticularly useful at low temperatures.  Table 1 listssome suppliers of low-ESR capacitors.\nFor best results when using capacitors other than those\nsuggested in Table 1 (or their equivalents), increasethe output filter capacitor’s size or use capacitators inparallel to reduce ESR.\nInput Bypass Capacitor\nThe input bypass capacitor, C1, reduces peak currentsdrawn from the voltage source and reduces the amountof noise at the voltage source caused by the switchingaction of the MAX764–MAX766.  The input voltagesource impedance determines the size of the capacitorrequired at the V+ input.  As with the output filtercapacitor, a low-ESR capacitor is highly recommended.For output currents up to 250mA, a 100µF to 120µFcapacitor with a voltage rating of at least 20V (C1) inparallel with a 0.1µF capacitor (C2) is adequate in mostapplications.  C2 must be placed as close as possi-\nble to the V+ and GND pins.-5V/-12V/-15V or Adjustable,\nHigh-Efficiency, Low I QDC-DC Inverters\n10 ______________________________________________________________________________________\nMAX764/MAX765/MAX766-5V/-12V/-15V or Adjustable,\nHigh-Efficiency, Low I QDC-DC Inverters\n______________________________________________________________________________________ 11Table 1.

Minimize ground noise by connectingGND, the input bypass capacitor ground lead, and theoutput filter capacitor ground lead to a single point (star\nground configuration).  Also minimize lead lengths toreduce stray capacitance, trace resistance, and radiat-ed noise.  In particular, keep the traces connected toFB and LX short.  C2 must be placed as close as pos-\nsible to the V+ and GND pins. If an external resistor\ndivider is used (Figure 3), the trace from FB to the resis-tors must be extremely short.\nSUPPLIER PHONE FAX\nAVX USA: (803) 448-9411 (803) 448-1943\nCoilcraft USA: (708) 639-6400 (708) 639-1469\nCoiltronics USA: (407) 241-7876 (407) 241-9339\nMatsuoUSA: (714) 969-2491\nJapan: 81-6-337-6450(714) 960-6492\n81-6-337-6456\nMotorola USA: (800) 521-6274 (602) 952-4190\nNichiconUSA: (708) 843-7500\nJapan: 81-7-5231-8461(708) 843-2798\n81-7-5256-4158\nRenco USA: (516) 586-5566 (516) 586-5562\nSanyo OS-CONUSA: (619) 661-6835\nJapan: 81-7-2070-1005(619) 661-1055\n81-7-2070-1174\nSprague Electric Co.
