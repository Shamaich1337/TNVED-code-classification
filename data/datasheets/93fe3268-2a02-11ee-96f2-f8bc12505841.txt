The switch -\ning frequency is fixed to 1MHz (LTC3624) or 2.25MHz \n(LTC3624\n-2) with a ±40% synchronization range. The \nregulator features ultralow quiescent current and high efficiency over a wide V\nOUT range.\nThe step-down regulator operates from an input voltage range of 2.7V to 17V and provides an adjustable output range from 0.6V to V\nIN while delivering up to 2A of output \ncurrent. A user-selectable mode input is provided to allow the user to trade off ripple noise for light load efficiency; Burst Mode operation provides the highest efficiency at light loads, while pulse-skipping mode provides the lowest voltage ripple. The MODE pin can also be used to sync the switching frequency to an external clock.\nEfficiency and Power Loss vs Load\n5V V OUT with 800mA Burst Clamp, f SW = 1MHzapplica Tions nWide V IN Range: 2.7V to 17V\n nWide V OUT Range: 0.6V to V IN\n n95% Max Efficiency\n nLow I Q: 3.5µA, Zero-Current Shutdown \n nConstant Frequency (1MHz/2.25MHz)\n nFixed V OUT Options Available\n nLow Dropout Operation (100% Duty Cycle) with Ultralow I\nQ\n n2A Rated Output Current\n n±1% Output Voltage Accuracy\n nCurrent Mode Operation for Excellent Line and Load T ransient Response\n nSynchronizable to External Clock\n nPulse-Skipping, Forced Continuous, Burst Mode® \nOperation\n nInternal Compensation and Soft-Start\n nOvertemperature Protection\n nCompact 8-Lead DFN (3mm × 3mm) Package\n nBattery Powered Equipment\n nPortable Instrumentation\n nEmergency Radios\n nGeneral Purpose Step-Down SuppliesL, L T , L TC, L TM, Burst Mode, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks \nand Hot Swap is a trademark of Linear Technology Corporation.

(Note 2) V IN = 12V, unless otherwise noted. \nNote 1: Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings \nmay cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: The LTC3624/LTC3624-2 is tested under pulsed load conditions \nsuch that T\nJ ≈ TA. The LTC3624E/LTC3624E-2 is guaranteed to meet \nspecifications from 0°C to 85°C junction temperature. Specifications over the –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by design, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls. The LTC3624I/LTC3624I-2 is guaranteed over the –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range and the LTC3624H is guaranteed over the –40°C to 150°C operating junction temperature range. High junction temperatures degrade operating lifetimes; operation lifetime is decreased for junction temperatures greater than 125°C. Note that the maximum ambient temperature consistent with these specifications is determined by specific operating conditions in conjunction with board layout, the rated package thermal impedance and other environmental factors. T\nJ is calculated from the ambient, T A, and power dissipation, P D, \naccording to the following formula:\n TJ = TA + (P D • θJA)\nNote 3: The quiescent current in forced continuous mode does not include switching loss of the power FETs.\nNote 4: The LTC3624 is tested in a proprietary test mode that servos FB to \nthe output of the error amplifier .\nNote 5: This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended to \nprotect the device during momentary overload conditions. The maximum rated junction temperature will be exceeded when overtemperature protection is active Continuous operation above the specified maximum operating junction temperature may impair device reliability. The overtemperature protection level is not production tested but guaranteed by design.elecTrical charac TerisTics\nSYMBOL PARAMETER CONDITIONS MIN TYP MAX UNITS\nVMODE/SYNC Pulse-Skipping Mode \nBurst Mode Operation Forced Continuous Mode \nV\nINTVCC  – 0.4 \n1.00.3 \n \nVINTVCC  – 1.2V V V\nI\nMODE/SYNC MODE/SYNC Input Current 0 100 nA\ntSS Internal Soft-Start Time 1 ms\nILIM Peak Current Limit VIN > 5V (E-, I-Grade) \nVIN > 5V (H-Grade)l \nl2.4 \n2.33 3.6 A \nA\nIFB FB Input Current 10 nA \nIFB(VOUT) Feedback Input Leakage Current Fixed Output Versions 2 10 µA\nVUVLO VINTVCC  Undervoltage Lockout VIN Ramping Up 2.4 2.6 2.7 V\nVUVLO(HYS) VINTVCC  Undervoltage Lockout Hysteresis 175 mV\nVOVLO VIN Overvoltage Lockout Rising l 18 19 20 V\nVOVLO(HYS) VIN Overvoltage Lockout Hysteresis 500 mV\nfOSC Oscillator Frequency LTC3624/LTC3624-3.3/LTC3624-5 (E-, I-Grade) (H-Grade) \nl \nl0.92 \n0.82 0.78 \n1.001.08 1.16MHz MHz  MHz \nLTC3624-2/LTC3624-23.3/LTC3624-25 \n(E-, I-Grade) (H-Grade)\n \nl \nl2.05 \n1.8 \n1.7 \n2.252.45 \n2.6MHz MHz  MHz\nf\nSYNC SYNC Capture Range LTC3624/LTC3624-3.3/LTC3624-5 50 150 %\nLTC3624-2/LTC3624-23.3/LTC3624-25 50 140 %\nVINTVCC VINTVCC  LDO Output Voltage VIN > 4V 3.2 3.6 4.0 V\nΔVPGOOD Power Good Range LTC3624/LTC3624-2 ±7.5 ±11.5 %\nLTC3624-3.3/LTC3624-5/LTC3624-23.3/LTC3624-25±7.5 ±13 %\nR\nPGOOD Power Good Resistance 280 350 Ω\ntPGOOD PGOOD Delay PGOOD Low to High PGOOD High to Low0 \n32Cycles Cycles\nLTC3624/LTC3624-25\n36242fdFor more information www.linear .com/L TC3624Typical perForMance charac TerisTics\nBurst Mode Operation\nPulse-Skipping Mode Operation Load T ransient Response Soft-Start OperationEfficiency vs Load Current in \nBurst Mode Operation at 2.25MHz\nIQ vs V IN IQ vs TemperatureEfficiency vs Load Current at 1MHzEfficiency vs Load Current in DropoutT\nJ = 25°C, unless otherwise noted.\nLOAD CURRENT (A)EFFICIENCY (%)\n36242 G01100\n80\n7090\n60\n50\n30\n20\n1040\n0\n0.0001 0.1 1 2 0.01 0.001VOUT = 5V\nVOUT = 3.3V\nVOUT = 2.5V VIN = 12VBurst Mode OPERATION\nLOAD CURRENT (A)EFFICIENCY (%)\n36242 G03100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0.0001 0.001 1 2 0.1 0.01Burst Mode\nOPERATION\nVIN = 5V\n100% DUTY CYCLEFREQ = 1MHzFORCE CONTINUOUSMODE\nVIN (V)0IQ (µA)7\n6810\n9\n16\n36242 G045\n4\n2\n13\n0\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 18 20SLEEP\nSHUTDOWN\nTEMPERATURE (°C)–50IQ (µA)610\n812\n100 150\n36242 G054\n2\n0\n0 50SHUTDOWNSLEEP\nVIN = 12V\nVOUT = 2.5V\nBurst Mode OPERATION\nIOUT = 30mA\nL = 2.2µH4µs/DIVSW\n5V/DIV\n36242 G06VOUT\nAC-COUPLED\n50mV/DIV\nIL\n1A/DIV\nVIN = 12V\nVOUT = 2.5V\nPULSE-SKIPPING MODEI\nOUT = 10mA\nL = 2.2µHSW\n5V/DIV\n36242 G07VOUT\nAC-COUPLED\n50mV/DIV\nIL\n1A/DIV\n4µs/DIV\nVIN = 12V\nVOUT = 2.5V\nILOAD  = 0A to 1.8A\nFORCED CONTINUOUS MODEVOUT\n200mV/DIV\n36242 G08ILOAD\n2A/DIVIL\n2A/DIV\n40µs/DIV\nVIN = 12V\nVOUT = 2.5V\nILOAD  = 1ARUN\n10V/DIV\n36242 G09IL\n0.5A/DIV PGOOD\n5V/DIVVOUT\n1V/DIV\n1ms/DIVLOAD CURRENT (A)EFFICIENCY (%)\n36242 G02100\n80\n7090\n60\n50\n30\n20\n1040\n0\n0.001 1 2 0.1 0.01VOUT = 5V\nVOUT = 3V\nVOUT = 2.5V VIN = 12VBurst Mode OPERATION\nLTC3624/LTC3624-26\n36242fdFor more information www.linear .com/L TC3624Typical perForMance charac TerisTics\nEfficiency vs Input VoltageOscillator Frequency \nvs Temperature\nRDS(ON)  vs Temperature\nLoad Regulation Line Regulation VIN vs Peak Current LimitOscillator Frequency vs Supply Voltage\nReference Voltage vs Temperature R\nDS(ON)  vs Input VoltageTJ = 25°C, unless otherwise noted.\nSUPPLY VOLTAGE (V)2OSCILLATOR FREQUENCY (MHz)1.01.5\n36242 G120.5\n0\n7 12 172.0\nVIN (V)0RDS(ON)  (m/uni03A9)\n200400600\n100300500\n8 10 12\n36242 G144 2 6 14 16BOTTOM FETTOP FET\nLOAD CURRENT (A)0–0.80–0.20\n–0.40–0.60 VOUT (%)0.200.80\n1.5\n36242 G1600.60\n0.40\n0.5 1 2FORCED CONTINUOUS MODE\nVIN (V)2–0.80–0.20\n–0.40–0.60 ∆VOUT (%)0.200.80\n14 12\n36242 G1700.60\n0.40\n4 6 10 8 16VIN (V)0EFFICIENCY (%)6080100\n15\n36242 G1040\n20507090\n30\n10\n0\n5 10 20ILOAD  = 10mAILOAD  = 1A\nVOUT = 5V\nFREQ = 1MHzBurst Mode OPERATIONLOW DROPOUT OPERATION\nTEMPERATURE (°C)–50REFERENCE VOLTAGE599.5600.0600.5\n36242 G13599.0\n598.5\n0 50 100 150598.0\n597.5\nTEMPERATURE (°C)–500100RDS(ON)  (m/uni03A9)300600\n0 50 75 100\n36242 G15200500\n400\n–25 25 150 125BOTTOM FETTOP FETVIN = 12V\nVIN (V)00PEAK CURRENT LIMIT (A)235\n36242 G181\n2 4 6 14 16 18 12 20 8 104\n150°C25°CTEMPERATURE (°C)–50OSCILLATOR FREQUENCY (MHz)1.52.0\n25 75\n36242 G111.0\n–25 0 50 100 150 1250.5\n0\nLTC3624/LTC3624-27\n36242fdFor more information www.linear .com/L TC3624pin Func Tions\nSW (Pin 1/Pins 1, 2): Switch Node Connection to the \nInductor of the Step-Down Regulator .\nVIN (Pin 2/Pins 3, 4): Input Voltage of the Step-Down \nRegulator .RUN (Pin 3/Pin 5): Logic Controlled RUN Input.

It operates through a wide V IN \nrange and regulates with ultralow quiescent current. The \noperation frequency is set at either 1MHz or 2.25MHz and can be synchronized to an external oscillator ±40% of the inherent frequency. To suit a variety of applications, the selectable MODE/SYNC pin allows the user to trade off output ripple for efficiency.\nThe output voltage is set by an external divider returned to \nthe FB pin. An error amplifier compares the divided output voltage with a reference voltage of 0.6V and adjusts the peak inductor current accordingly. Overvoltage and un -\ndervoltage comparators will pull the PGOOD output low if the output voltage is not within ±\n7.5% of the programmed \nvalue. The PGOOD output will go low 32 clock cycles after falling out of regulation and will go high immediately after achieving regulation.\nMain Control Loop\nDuring normal operation, the top power switch (P-channel \nMOSFET) is turned on at the beginning of a clock cycle. The inductor current is allowed to ramp up to a peak level. Once that level is reached, the top power switch is turned off and the bottom switch (N-channel MOSFET) is turned on until the next clock cycle. The peak current level is con -\ntrolled by the internally compensated ITH voltage, which is the output \nof the error amplifier . This amplifier compares \nthe FB voltage to the 0.6V internal reference. When the load current increases, the FB voltage decreases slightly below the reference, which causes the error amplifier to increase the ITH voltage until the average inductor current matches the new load current. \nThe main control loop is shut down by pulling the RUN \npin to ground.\nLow Current Operation\nT wo discontinuous-conduction modes (DCMs) are available \nto control the operation of the LTC3624/LTC3624-2 at low currents. Both modes, Burst Mode operation and pulse-skipping, automatically switch from continuous operation to the selected mode when the load current is low.To optimize efficiency, Burst Mode operation can be selected by tying the MODE/SYNC pin to INTV\nCC. In Burst Mode \noperation, the peak inductor current is set to be at least 800mA, even if the output of the error amplifier demands less. Thus, when the switcher is on at relatively light output loads, FB voltage will rise and cause the ITH voltage to drop. Once the ITH voltage goes below 0.2V, the switcher goes into its sleep mode with both power switches off. The switcher remains in this sleep state until the external load pulls the output voltage below its regulation point. During sleep mode, the part draws an ultralow 3.5µA of quiescent current from V\nIN.\nTo minimize V OUT ripple, pulse-skipping mode can be se -\nlected by grounding the MODE/SYNC pin. In the LTC3624/LTC3624\n-2, pulse-skipping mode is implemented similarly \nto Burst Mode operation with the peak inductor current set to be at least 132mA. This results in lower ripple than in Burst Mode operation with the trade-off being slightly lower efficiency. \nForced Continuous Mode Operation\nAside from the two discontinuous-conduction modes, the \nLTC3624/LTC3624-2 also has the ability to operate in the forced continuous mode by setting the MODE/SYNC volt -\nage between 1V and V\nINTVCC  – 1.2V. In forced continuous \nmode, the switcher will switch cycle by cycle regardless of what the output load current is. If forced continuous mode is selected, the minimum peak current is set to be –266mA in order to ensure that the part can operate continuously at zero output load. \nHigh Duty Cycle/Dropout Operation\nWhen the input supply voltage decreases towards the \noutput voltage, the duty cycle increases and slope com -\npensation is required to maintain the fixed switching frequency. The LTC3624/LTC3624\n-2 has internal circuitry \nto accurately maintain the peak current limit (I LIM) of 3A \neven at high duty cycles.\nAs the duty cycle approaches 100%, the LTC3624/\nLTC3624-2 enters dropout operation. During dropout, if force continuous mode is selected, the top PMOS switch is turned on continuously, and all active circuitry is kept \nLTC3624/LTC3624-210\n36242fdFor more information www.linear .com/L TC3624opera Tion\nalive. However , if Burst Mode operation or pulse-skipping \nmode is selected, the part will transition in and out of sleep mode depending on the output load current. This significantly reduces the quiescent current, thus prolong -\ning the use of the input supply.\nV\nIN Overvoltage Protection\nIn order to protect the internal power MOSFET devices \nagainst transient voltage spikes, the LTC3624/LTC3624-2 constantly monitors the V\nIN pin for an overvoltage condi -\ntion. When V IN rises above 19V, the regulator suspends \noperation by shutting off both power MOSFETs. Once V IN \ndrops below 18.5V, the regulator immediately resumes normal operation. The regulator executes its soft-start function when exiting an overvoltage condition.\nMinimum On-Time\nThe minimum on-time is the smallest duration of the time \nthe top power switch is allowed to be in its on state. This time is typically 60ns. In forced continuous mode operation, the minimum on-time limit imposes a minimum duty cycle of 6% for the LTC3624 (F\nSW = 1MHz) and 13.5% for the LTC3624-2 (F SW = 2.25MHz). In the rare cases that this \nminimum on-time is violated, the output voltage may lose regulation. In such situation, the user must choose either Burst Mode or pulse-skipping mode operation, or apply a slower external clock to force a slower switching frequency in order to adhere to the minimum on-time limitation.\nLow Supply Operation\nThe LTC3624 incorporates an undervoltage lockout circuit \nwhich shuts down the part when the input voltage drops below 2.7V. As the input voltage rises slightly above the undervoltage threshold, the switcher will begin its basic operation. However , the R\nDS(ON)  of the top and bottom \nswitch will be slightly higher than that specified in the electrical characteristics due to lack of gate drive. Refer to graph of R\nDS(ON)  versus V IN for more details.\nSoft-Start\nThe LTC3624/LTC3624-2 has an internal 1ms soft-start \nramp. During start-up soft-start operation, the switcher will operate in pulse-skipping mode. \napplica Tions inForMaTion\nOutput Voltage Programming\nThe output voltage is set by external resistive divider ac -\ncording to the following equation for adjustable output \nversions :\n VOUT=0.6V•1+R2\nR1\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8f6\uf8f8\nThe resistive divider allows the FB pin to sense a fraction \nof the output voltage as shown in Figure 1.\nFor fixed V OUT options, connect FB pin directly to V OUT.\nInput Capacitor (C IN) Selection\nThe input capacitance, C IN, is needed to filter the square \nwave current at the drain of the top power MOSFET .

Special polymer capacitors are very low ESR but have lower capacitance density than other types. Tantalum capacitors have the highest capacitance density but it is important to only use types that have been surge tested for use in switching power supplies. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors have significantly higher ESR, but can be used in cost-sensitive applications provided that consideration is given to ripple current ratings and long-term reliability. Ceramic capacitors have excellent low ESR characteristics and small footprints. \nUsing Ceramic Input and Output Capacitors\nHigher values, lower cost ceramic capacitors are now \nbecoming available in smaller case sizes. Their high ripple current, high voltage rating and low ESR make them ideal for switching regulator applications. However , care must be taken when these capacitors are used at the input and output. When a ceramic capacitor is used at the input and the power is supplied by a wall adapter through long wires, a load step at the output can induce ringing at the V\nIN input. At best, this ringing can couple to the output and \nbe mistaken as loop instability. At worst, a sudden inrush of current through the long wires can potentially cause a voltage spike at V\nIN large enough to damage the part. \nWhen choosing the input and output ceramic capacitors, choose the X5R and X7R dielectric formulations. These dielectrics have the best temperature and voltage char -\nacteristics of all the ceramics for a given value and size.\nSince the ESR of a ceramic capacitor is so low , the input \nand output \ncapacitor must instead fulfill a charge storage \nrequirement. During a load step, the output capacitor must \ninstantaneously supply the current to support the load until the feedback loop raises the switch current enough to support the load. Typically, five cycles are required to respond to a load step, but only in the first cycle does the output voltage drop linearly. The output droop, V\nDROOP , is prevent large voltage transients from occurring, a low ESR input capacitor sized for the maximum RMS current should be used. The maximum RMS current is given by:\n  IRMS≅IOUT(MAX)VOUT\nVINVIN\nVOUT–1\nThis formula has a maximum at V IN = 2V OUT, where:\n  IRMS≅IOUT\n2\nThis simple worst-case condition is commonly used for design because even significant deviations do not offer much relief. Note that ripple current ratings from capacitor manufacturers are often based on only 2000 hours of life which makes it advisable to further derate the capacitor , or choose a capacitor rated at a higher temperature than required. Several capacitors may also be paralleled to meet size or height requirements in the design. For low input voltage applications, sufficient bulk input capacitance is needed to minimize transient effects during output load changes.\nOutput Capacitor (C\nOUT) Selection\nThe selection of C OUT is determined by the effective series \nresistance (ESR) that is required to minimize voltage ripple \nand load step transients as well as the amount of bulk capacitance that is necessary to ensure that the control loop is stable. Loop stability can be checked by viewing the load transient response. The output ripple, ∆V\nOUT, is \ndetermined by:\n ∆VOUT< ∆IL1\n8•f•COUT+ESR\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8f6\uf8f8\nThe output ripple is highest at maximum input voltage \nsince ∆IL increases with input voltage. Multiple capaci-\ntors placed in parallel may be needed to meet the ESR and RMS current handling requirements. Dr y tantalum, \nLTC3624/LTC3624-212\n36242fdFor more information www.linear .com/L TC3624applica Tions inForMaTion\nusually about three times the linear drop of the first cycle. \nThus, a good place to start with the output capacitor value is approximately:\n  COUT= 3ΔIOUT\nf•VDROOP\nMore capacitance may be required depending on the duty cycle and load-step requirements. In most applications, the input capacitor is merely required to supply high frequency bypassing, since the impedance to the supply is very low. A 10μF ceramic capacitor is usually enough for these conditions. Place this input capacitor as close to the V\nIN pin as possible.\nOutput Power Good\nWhen the LTC3624/LTC3624-2’s output voltage is within \nthe ±7.5% window of the regulation point, the output voltage is good and the PGOOD pin is pulled high with an external resistor . Otherwise, an internal open-drain pull-down device (280Ω) will pull the PGOOD pin low. To prevent unwanted PGOOD glitches during transients or dynamic V\nOUT changes, the LTC3624 /LTC3624-2 ’s PGOOD \nfalling edge includes a blanking delay of approximately 32 switching cycles.\nFrequency Sync Capability\nThe LTC3624/LTC3624-2 has the capability to sync to \na ±40% range of the internal programmed frequency. It takes 2 to 3 cycles of external clock to engage the sync mode, and roughly 2µs of no clocks for the part to realize that the sync signal is gone. Once engaged in sync, the LTC3624/LTC3624-2 immediately runs at the external clock frequency.\nInductor Selection\nGiven the desired input and output voltages, the inductor \nvalue and operating frequency determine the ripple current:\n ∆IL=VOUT\nf•L1–VOUT\nVIN(MAX)\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8f6\uf8f8Lower ripple current reduces power losses in the inductor , \nESR losses in the output capacitors and output voltage ripple. Highest efficiency operation is obtained at low frequency with small ripple current. However , achieving this requires a large inductor . There is a trade-off between component size, efficiency and operating frequency. \nA reasonable starting point is to choose a ripple current \nthat is about 40% of I\nOUT(MAX) . To guarantee that ripple \ncurrent does not exceed a specified maximum, the induc -\ntance should be chosen according to:\n L =VOUT\nf•∆IL(MAX)1–VOUT\nVIN(MAX)\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8f6\uf8f8\nOnce the value for L is known, the type of inductor must \nbe selected. Actual core loss is independent of core size for a fixed inductor value, but is very dependent on the inductance selected. As the inductance or frequency in -\ncreases, core losses decrease. Unfortunately, increased inductance requires more turns of wire and therefore copper losses will increase.\nFerrite designs have ver y low core losses and are pre -\nferred at high switching frequencies, so design goals can \nconcentrate on copper loss and preventing saturation. Ferrite core material saturates “hard”\n, which means that \ninductance collapses abruptly when the peak design current is exceeded. This results in an abrupt increase in inductor ripple current and consequent output voltage ripple. Do not allow the core to saturate!\nDifferent core materials and shapes will change the size/\ncurrent and price/current relationship of an inductor . Toroid \nor shielded pot cores in ferrite or permalloy materials are small and don’t radiate much energy, but generally cost more than powdered iron core inductors with similar characteristics. The choice of which style inductor to use mainly depends on the price versus size requirements and any radiated field/EMI requirements. New designs for surface mount inductors are available from Toko, Vishay,  Coilcraft, NEC/Tokin, Cooper , TDK and Würth Elektronik. Refer to Table 1 for more details.\nLTC3624/LTC3624-213\n36242fdFor more information www.linear .com/L TC3624applica Tions inForMaTion\nChecking T ransient Response\nThe regular loop response can be checked by looking at the \nload transient response. Switching regulators take several cycles to respond to a step in load current. When a load step occurs, V\nOUT immediately shifts by an amount equal to the \n∆ILOAD • ESR, where ESR is the effective series resistance \nof C OUT. ∆ILOAD also begins to charge or discharge C OUT \ngenerating a feedback error signal used by the regulator to return V OUT to its steady-state value. During this recovery \ntime, V OUT can be monitored for overshoot or ringing that \nwould indicate a stability problem.\nThe initial output voltage step may not be within the \nbandwidth of the feedback loop, so the standard second order overshoot/DC ratio cannot be used to determine phase margin. In addition, a feedforward capacitor can be added to improve the high frequency response, as Table 1.

Capacitor C FF provides phase lead by \ncreating a high frequency zero with R2, which improves \nthe phase margin.\nThe output voltage settling behavior is related to the stability \nof the closed-loop system and will demonstrate the actual overall supply performance. For a detailed explanation of optimizing the compensation components, including a review of control loop theory, refer to application Note 76.\nIn some applications, a more severe transient can be caused \nby switching in loads with large (>1µF) input capacitors. The discharge input capacitors are effectively put in paral -\nlel with C\nOUT, causing a rapid drop in V OUT. No regulator \ncan deliver enough current to prevent this problem if the switch connecting the load has low resistance and is driven quickly. The solution is to limit the turn-on speed of the load switch driver . A Hot Swap™ controller is designed specifically for this purpose and usually incorporates current limiting, short-circuit protection and soft-starting.\nEfficiency Considerations\nThe percent efficiency of a switching regulator is equal to \nthe output power divided by the input power times 100%. It is often useful to analyze individual losses to determine what is limiting the efficiency and which change would produce the most improvement. Percent efficiency can be expressed as:\n % Efficiency = 100% – (L1 + L2 + L3 +…)\nwhere L1, L2, etc. are the individual losses as a per\ncent-\nage of input power . Although all dissipative elements in the cir cuit produce losses, three main sour \nces usually \naccount for most of the losses in LTC3624/LTC3624-2 circuits: 1) I\n2R losses, 2) switching and biasing losses, \n3) other losses.\n1. I2R losses are calculated from the DC resistances of \nthe internal switches, R SW, and external inductor , R L. \nIn continuous mode, the average output current flows \nthrough inductor L but is “ chopped”  between the \ninternal top and bottom power MOSFETs. Thus, the series resistance looking into the SW pin is a function of both top and bottom MOSFET R\nDS(ON)  and the duty \ncycle (DC) as follows:  RSW = (R DS(ON)TOP )(DC) + (R DS(ON)BOT )(1 – DC)\n The R DS(ON)  for both the top and bottom MOSFETs can be \nobtained from the Typical Performance Characteristics curves. Thus to obtain I\n2R losses:\n  I2R losses = I OUT2(RSW + R L)\n2. The switching current is the sum of the MOSFET driver and control currents. The power \nMOSFET driver current \nresults from switching the gate capacitance of the power MOSFETs. Each time a power MOSFET gate is switched from low to high to low again, a packet of charge dQ moves from IN to ground. The resulting dQ/dt is a cur -\nrent out of IN that is typically much larger than the DC control bias current. In continuous mode, I\nGATECHG  = \nf(QT + Q B), where Q T and Q B are the gate charges of \nthe internal top and bottom power MOSFETs and f is the switching frequency. The power loss is thus:\n  Switching \nLoss = IGATECHG  • VIN \n The gate charge loss is proportional to V IN and f and \nthus their effects will be more pronounced at higher supply voltages and higher frequencies.\n3.\n Other “hidden”\n losses such as transition loss and cop -\nper trace and internal load resistances can account for additional efficiency \ndegradations in the overall power \nsystem. It is very important to include these “system” level losses in the design of a system. T ransition loss arises from the brief amount of time the top power MOSFET spends in the saturated region during switch node transitions. The LTC3624/ LTC3624-2 internal \npower devices switch quickly enough that these losses are not significant compared to other sources. These losses plus other losses, including diode conduction losses during dead-time and inductor core losses, generally account for less than 2% total additional loss.\nThermal Conditions\nIn a majority of applications, the LTC3624/LTC3624-2 \ndoes not dissipate much heat due to its high efficiency and low thermal resistance of its exposed pad DFN package. However , in applications where the LTC3624/LTC3624-2 is running at high ambient temperature, high V\nIN, high \nswitching frequency, and maximum output current load, \nLTC3624/LTC3624-215\n36242fdFor more information www.linear .com/L TC3624the heat dissipated may exceed the maximum junction \ntemperature of the part. If the junction temperature reaches approximately 160°C, both power switches will be turned off until the temperature drops about 15°C cooler .\nTo avoid the LTC3624/LTC3624-2 from exceeding the \nmaximum junction temperature, the user will need to do some thermal analysis. The goal of the thermal analysis is to determine whether the power dissipated exceeds the maximum junction temperature of the part. The tempera -\nture rise is given by:\n TRISE = P D • θJA \nAs an example, consider the case when the LTC3624/\nLTC3624 -2 is used in applications where V IN = 12V, I OUT = 2A,  \nf = 1MHz, V OUT = 1.8V. The equivalent power MOSFET \nresistance R SW is:\n RSW=RDS(ON)TOP •VOUT\nVIN+ – RDS( N O )BOT •1VOUT\nVIN\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\uf8ed\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\uf8f8\n=200mΩ •1.8V\n12V+100mΩ •1–1.8V\n12V \uf8ed \uf8f8\n=115mΩ\nThe V IN current during 1MHz force continuous operation \nwith no load is about 8mA, which includes switching and internal biasing current loss, transition loss, inductor core loss and other losses in the application. Therefore, the total power dissipated by the part is:\n PD  = IOUT2 • RSW + V IN • IIN(Q)\n  = 2A2 • 115mΩ + 12V • 8mA\n  = 556mW\nThe DFN \n3mm × 3mm package junction-to-ambient thermal \nresistance, θJA, is around 43°C/W . Therefore, the junction \ntemperature of the regulator operating in a 25°C ambient temperature is approximately:\n TJ = TA + Trise = 25°C + 0.556W • 43°C/W = 49°CRemembering that the above junction temperature is obtained from an R\nDS(ON)  at 25°C, we might recalculate \nthe junction temperature based on a higher R DS(ON)  since \nit increases with temperature. Redoing the calculation assuming that R\nSW increased 5% at 49°C yields a new \njunction temperature of 50°C. If the application calls for a higher ambient temperature and/or higher switching frequency, care should be taken to reduce the temperature rise of the part by using a heat sink or forced air flow. \nBoard Layout Considerations\nWhen laying out the printed circuit board, the following \nchecklist should be used to ensure proper operation of the LTC3624/LTC3624-2 (refer to Figure 3). Check the following in your layout:\n1.\n Do the capacitors C IN connect to the V IN and GND as \nclose as possible? These capacitors provide the AC \ncurrent to the internal power MOSFETs and their drivers.\n2. Are \nCOUT and L closely connected? The (–) plate of \nCOUT returns current to GND and the (–) plate of C IN.\n3. The resistive divider , \nR1 and R2, must be connected \nbetween the (+) plate of C OUT and a ground line ter -\nminated near GND. The feedback signal V FB should be \nrouted away from noisy components and traces, such as the SW line, and its trace length should be minimized. Keep R1 and R2 close to the IC.\n4.\n Solder the exposed pad (Pin 9) \non the bottom of the \npackage to the GND plane. Connect this GND plane to other layers with thermal vias to help dissipate heat from the LTC3624/LTC3624-2.\n5.\n Keep sensitive \ncomponents away from the SW pin. The \ninput capacitor , C IN, feedback resistors, and INTV CC \nbypass capacitors should be routed away from the SW trace and the inductor .\n6.\n A ground plane is preferred. \n7. Flood all unused areas on all layers with copper , which reduces the temperature rise of power components. These copper areas should be connected to GND.applica Tions inForMaTion\nLTC3624/LTC3624-216\n36242fdFor more information www.linear .com/L TC3624Design Example\nAs a design example, consider using the LTC3624/ LTC3624-2  \nin an application with the following specifications:\n VIN = 10.8V to 13.2V\n VOUT = 3.3V\n IOUT(MAX)  = 2A\n IOUT(MIN)  = 0A\n fSW = 2.25MHz\nBecause efficiency and quiescent current are important at \nboth 500mA and 0A current states, Burst Mode operation will be utilized.\nGiven the internal oscillator of 2.25MHz, we can calcu -\nlate the inductor value for about 40% ripple current at \nmaximum V\nIN:\n L =3.3V\n2.25MHz•0.8A\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8f6\uf8f81–3.3V\n13.2V\uf8eb\uf8ed\uf8f6\uf8f8=1.38µHGiven this, a 1.5µH inductor would suffice.\nCOUT will be selected based on the ESR that is required to \nsatisfy the output voltage ripple requirement and the bulk \ncapacitance needed for loop stability.
