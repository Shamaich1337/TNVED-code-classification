Using only two low-costcapacitors, the charge pump’s 100mA output replacesswitching regulators, eliminating inductors and theirassociated cost, size, and EMI. Greater than 90%efficiency over most of its load-current range combinedwith a typical operating current of only 120µA providesideal performance for both battery-powered and board-level voltage conversion applications. The MAX660 canalso double the output voltage of an input power supplyor battery, providing +9.35V at 100mA from a +5Vinput.\nA frequency control (FC) pin selects either 10kHz typ or\n80kHz typ (40kHz min) operation to optimize capacitorsize and quiescent current. The oscillator frequencycan also be adjusted with an external capacitor ordriven with an external clock. The MAX660 is a pin-compatible, high-current upgrade of the ICL7660.\nThe MAX660 is available in both 8-pin DIP and small-\noutline packages in commercial, extended, and militarytemperature ranges.\nFor 50mA applications, consider the MAX860/MAX861\npin-compatible devices (also available in ultra-smallµMAX packages).\n________________________Applications\nLaptop Computers\nMedical InstrumentsInterface Power SuppliesHand-Held InstrumentsOperational-Amplifier Power Supplies___________________________ Features\n♦Small Capacitors\n♦0.65V Typ Loss at 100mA Load\n♦Low 120µA Operating Current\n♦6.5ΩTyp Output Impedance\n♦Guaranteed R OUT < 15 Ωfor C1 = C2 = 10 µF\n♦Pin-Compatible High-Current ICL7660 Upgrade\n♦Inverts or Doubles Input Supply Voltage\n♦Selectable Oscillator Frequency: 10kHz/80kHz\n♦88% Typ Conversion Efficiency at 100mA\n(ILto GND)\n1\n2\n3\n21\n3478\n56\n8\n7\n6\n5MAX660\nMAX660FC\nCAP+\nGND\nCAP-V+\nOSC\nLV\nOUTFC\nCAP+\nGND\nCAP-V+\nOSC\nLV\nOUT\nC2\n1µF to 150 µF\nVOLTAGE INVERTER\nPOSITIVE VOLTAGE DOUBLER+VIN\n1.5V TO 5.5V\nINVERTED\nNEGATIVE\nVOLTAGE\nOUTPUTC1\n1µF to 150 µF\nDOUBLED\nPOSITIVE\nVOLTAGE\nOUTPUT\nC2\n1µF to 150 µFC1\n1µF to 150 µF\n+VIN\n2.5V TO 5.5V\n4_________Typical Operating Circuits\n1\n23\n48\n7\n6\n5V+\nOSC\nLV\nOUT CAP-GNDCAP+FC\nMAX660\nDIP/SOTOP VIEW__________________Pin Configuration______________Ordering Information\nPART TEMP.

For highest performance, low\neffective series resistance (ESR) capacitors should beused. See Capacitor Selection section for more details.\nWhen using the inverting mode with a supply voltage\nless than 3V, LV must be connected to GND. Thisbypasses the internal regulator circuitry and providesbest performance in low-voltage applications. Whenusing the inverter mode with a supply voltage above3V, LV may be connected to GND or left open. The partis typically operated with LV grounded, but since LVmay be left open, the substitution of the MAX660 for theICL7660 is simplified. LV must be grounded when over-driving OSC ( see Changing Oscillator Frequency sec-\ntion). Connect LV to OUT (for any supply voltage) whenusing the doubling mode.\n__________Applications Information\nNegative Voltage Converter\nThe most common application of the MAX660 is as acharge-pump voltage inverter. The operating circuituses only two external capacitors, C1 and C2 (seeTypical Operating Circuits ).\nEven though its output is not actively regulated, the\nMAX660 is very insensitive to load current changes.  Atypical output source resistance of 6.5 Ωmeans that\nwith an input of +5V the output voltage is -5V underlight load, and decreases only to -4.35V with a load of100mA. Output source resistance vs. temperature andsupply voltage are shown in the Typical Operating\nCharacteristics graphs.\nOutput ripple voltage is calculated by noting the output\ncurrent supplied is solely from capacitor C2 duringone-half of the charge-pump cycle. This introduces a\npeak-to-peak ripple of:\nV\nRIPPLE =           I OUT + IOUT(ESR C2)\n2(fPUMP ) (C2)\nFor a nominal f PUMP of 5kHz (one-half the nominal\n10kHz oscillator frequency) and C2 = 150µF with anESR of 0.2 Ω, ripple is approximately 90mV with a\n100mA load current. If C2 is raised to 390µF, the rippledrops to 45mV.\nPositive Voltage Doubler\nThe MAX660 operates in the voltage-doubling mode asshown in the Typical Operating Circuit. The no-load\noutput is 2 x V\nIN.\nOther Switched-Capacitor Converters\nPlease refer to Table 1, which shows Maxim’s charge-pump offerings.\nChanging Oscillator Frequency\nFour modes control the MAX660’s clock frequency, aslisted below:\nFC OSC Oscillator Frequency\nOpen Open 10kHz\nFC = V+ Open 80kHzOpen or External See Typical Operating\nFC = V+ Capacitor Characteristics\nOpen External External Clock Frequency\nClock\nWhen FC and OSC are unconnected (open), the oscil-\nlator runs at 10kHz typically.

Single-Output Charge Pumps\nMAX660CMOS Monolithic Voltage Converter\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 7frequency eight times. In the third mode, the oscillator\nfrequency is lowered by connecting a capacitorbetween OSC and GND. FC can still multiply the fre-quency by eight times in this mode, but for a lowerrange of frequencies (see Typical Operating\nCharacteristics ).\nIn the inverter mode, OSC may also be overdriven by an\nexternal clock source that swings within 100mV of V+and GND. Any standard CMOS logic output is suitablefor driving OSC. When OSC is overdriven, FC has noeffect. Also, LV must be grounded when overdrivingOSC. Do not overdrive OSC in voltage-doubling mode.\nNote: In all modes, the frequency of the signal appear-\ning at CAP+ and CAP- is one-half that of the oscillator.Also, an undesirable effect of lowering the oscillator fre-quency is that the effective output resistance of thecharge pump increases. This can be compensated byincreasing the value of the charge-pump capacitors(see Capacitor Selection section and Typical Operating\nCharacteristics ).\nIn some applications, the 5kHz output ripple frequency\nmay be low enough to interfere with other circuitry. Ifdesired, the oscillator frequency can then be increasedthrough use of the FC pin or an external oscillator asdescribed above. The output ripple frequency is one-half the selected oscillator frequency. Increasing theclock frequency increases the MAX660’s quiescentcurrent, but also allows smaller capacitance values tobe used for C1 and C2.\n________________Capacitor Selection\nThree factors (in addition to load current) affect theMAX660 output voltage drop from its ideal value:\n1)  MAX660 output resistance2)  Pump (C1) and reservoir (C2) capacitor ESRs3)  C1 and C2 capacitance\nThe voltage drop caused by MAX660 output resistance\nis the load current times the output resistance.Similarly, the loss in C2 is the load current times C2’sESR. The loss in C1, however, is larger because ithandles currents that are greater than the load currentduring charge-pump operation. The voltage drop dueto C1 is therefore about four times C1’s ESR multipliedby the load current. Consequently, a low (or high) ESRcapacitor has a much greater impact on performancefor C1 than for C2.\nGenerally, as the pump frequency of the MAX660\nincreases, the capacitance values required to maintaincomparable ripple and output resistance diminish pro-portionately. The curves of Figure 2 show the total circuitoutput resistance for various capacitor values (the pump\nand reservoir capacitors’ values are equal) and oscillatorfrequencies. These curves assume 0.25 Ωcapacitor ESR\nand a 5.25 ΩMAX660 output resistance, which is why\nthe flat portion of the curve shows a 6.5 Ω(R\nOMAX660 +\n4 (ESR C1) + ESR C2) effective output resistance.  Note:\nRO= 5.25 Ωis used, rather than the typical 6.5 Ω,\nbecause the typical specification includes the effect ofthe ESRs of the capacitors in the test circuit.\nIn addition to the curves in Figure 2, four bar graphs in\nthe Typical Operating Characteristics show output cur-\nrent for capacitances ranging from 0.33µF to 220µF.Output current is plotted for inputs of 4.5V (5V-10%) and3.0V (3.3V-10%), and allow for 10% and 20% outputdroop with each input voltage. As can be seen from thegraphs, the MAX660 6.5 Ωseries resistance limits\nincreases in output current vs. capacitance for valuesmuch above 47µF. Larger values may still be useful,however, to reduce ripple.\nTo reduce the output ripple caused by the charge\npump, increase the reservoir capacitor C2 and/orreduce its ESR. Also, the reservoir capacitor must havelow ESR if filtering high-frequency noise at the output isimportant.\nNot all manufacturers guarantee capacitor ESR in the\nrange required by the MAX660.  In general, capacitor ESRis inversely proportional to physical size, so larger capaci-tance values and higher voltage ratings tend to reduce\nESR. 20\n0\n1612\nMAX660-fig 2\nCAPACITANCE ( µF)TOTAL OUTPUT SOURCE RESISTANCE ( Ω)\n18\n16\n14\n10\n8\n4\n2\n2 4 6 8 10 100 1000100kHz\n50kHz\n10kHz20kHz\n5kHz\n2kHz\n1kHz\nESR = 0.25 Ω\nFOR BOTHC1 AND C2\nMAX660 OUTPUT\nSOURCE RESISTANCEASSUMED TO BE5.25Ω\nFigure 2.
