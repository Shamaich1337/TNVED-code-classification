### Component Summary for Molex Part Number 47053-1000

#### Key Specifications:
- **Voltage Rating**: 500V
- **Current Rating**: 4.0A (maximum per contact)
- **Power Consumption**: Not specified directly; power can be calculated using P = V x I (e.g., at maximum voltage and current, P = 500V x 4A = 2000W, but this is theoretical and not typical for this component).
- **Operating Temperature Range**: Not explicitly stated; refer to product specification for details.
- **Package Type**: Bag
- **Special Features**: 
  - Friction lock mechanism
  - Vertical orientation
  - 4 circuits (maximum)
  - Mates with specific Molex parts
  - Low-Halogen compliant
  - RoHS compliant
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (JEDEC J-STD-020E)**: Not specified in the provided information.

#### Component Description:
The Molex 47053-1000 is a **KK 254 Vertical Header** designed for PCB (Printed Circuit Board) applications. It features a friction lock for secure connections and is configured with 4 circuits. The component is made from durable materials, including a copper alloy for the metal parts and nylon for the resin, ensuring reliable performance in electronic assemblies.
