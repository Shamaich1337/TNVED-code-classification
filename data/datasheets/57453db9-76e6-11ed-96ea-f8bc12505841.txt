  - Hold current (IH): 0.75A
  - Trip current (IT): 1.50A
- **Power Consumption:** Typical power dissipation (Pd) when tripped: 0.13W
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -40°C to 85°C
- **Package Type:** Surface mount (SB model, dimensions: 4.72mm x 5.44mm x 1.70mm)
- **Special Features:**
  - Faster time to trip compared to standard SMD devices
  - Lower resistance than standard SMD devices
  - Tape and reel packaging available
- **Moisture Sensitive Level:** Not specified in the provided text, but typically follows JEDEC J-STD-020E standards for surface mount devices.

#### Description:
The ERFSB075602RZ is a surface mount resettable fuse, also known as a polymeric positive temperature coefficient (PTC) device. Its primary function is to protect electronic circuits from overcurrent conditions. When the current exceeds the specified trip current, the device increases its resistance significantly, effectively interrupting the circuit. Once the fault is cleared and the current returns to a safe level, the fuse resets itself automatically.

#### Typical Applications:
This resettable fuse is suitable for a variety of applications, particularly in environments where space is limited and low voltage power supplies need protection. Typical applications include:
- Computers and peripherals
- General electronics
- Automotive applications
- High-density boards where space is a constraint

The ERFSB075602RZ is ideal for use in power management systems, ensuring that devices are safeguarded against potential damage from excessive current while maintaining a compact footprint.
