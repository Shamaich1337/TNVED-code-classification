V2  \nSampling Phase Detector Modules  \nApplications  \nThe Sampling Phase Detector (SPD) is composed of \na comb generator, a coupling network and a single \nbalanced mixer. It is designed to be used in phase \nlocking circuits for microwave oscillators.  \nThe following description of the operation of the SPD \nrefers to Fig. 1. The step recovery diode (SRD) D1 \ncharges during the forward bias part of the AC cycle. \nThe charge is withdrawn during the reverse bias part \nof the AC cycle, and D1 transitions, producing an \nedge. The capacitors C1 and C2 differentiate the \nedge into an impulse and apply this impulse to the \nschottky diodes D2 and D3, which are turned on \nbriefly and apply a sample of the microwave signal \nto the IF filter. When the reference signal and the \nmicrowave signal are harmonically related, the same \nvoltage point on the microwave signal is applied to \nthe IF filter, producing a steady DC output or offset \nvoltage. When the two signals are not exactly            \nrelated, a different point on the microwave signal is \napplied to the IF filter each cycle, producing a sine \nwave with a frequency that is equal to the difference \nbetween the microwave signal ’s frequency and the \nfrequency of the closest harmonic of the reference \nsignal. This frequency is also defined as the                  \ndifference frequency.  \nThe design criteria for the circuit, shown in Fig. 2, is \ndescribed below. Transformer T1 matches the             \nreference oscillator to the SRD and converts the  \noscillator ’s signal from single ended to balanced. \nThe SPD requires 17 dBm to 27 dBm from the              \nreference oscillator to work properly. The SRD          \nimpedance, which is about 50 ohms at 17 dBm,           \ndecreases as the drive level is increased. R1 and \nR2, each of which should be about 50 ohms, provide \na termination for the microwave signal and dampen \nreflections in the SPD caused by mismatches. C1 \nisolates the IF signal from the microwave source. Its \nvalue should be chosen so it has a high impedance \n(at least 150 ohms) at the IF frequency and a low \nimpedance (<10 ohms) at the microwave frequency.  \nFig.1  \nFig.2  \nC1 can be replaced by a high pass or band pass \nfilter network. The circuit ’s performance can be        \nimproved by matching the microwave source to the \nSchottky diodes. Also use microwave layout rules for \nthe physical layout of the interface circuit between \nthe microwave source and the Schottky. R3 and C2 \ncreate a low pass filter which separates out the IF \nsignal. The cut off frequency of this filter should be \nselected to block the next higher harmonic of the \nreference oscillator. For example, the harmonics of a \n100 MHz reference occur every 100 MHz, the cut off \nfrequency must be less then 100 MHz. R3 may be \nreplaced by an inductor of an appropriate value. \nCare must be taken not to shunt the microwave          \nsignal away from the Schottky with a low quality  \ninductor. R4, R5 and R6 provide the return path for \nthe IF signal. R4 provides a DC offset adjustment. \nR5 and R6 should have a value of at least 100 ohms \nand be placed as close to the SPD as possible. R5 \nand R6 keep the impulse and microwave signal         \ninside the SPD. Fig. 3 shows an alternative IF return \nnetwork with R4 removed. The resistors R5 and R6 \ncan be replaced with low pass filters. The low pass \nfilters need to present a high impedance (Z >200 Ω) \nto the SPD to keep from loading down the impulse \nand microwave signal.  \nFig.3  \n4 4 \nMACOM Technology Solutions Inc.

V2  \nSampling Phase Detector Modules  \nThere are four models of the SPD, each one is         \ndesigned to work at a particular microwave           \nfrequency. This maximum frequency is not a cut off \nfrequency; but, it is a suggested upper limit based \non the Schottky junction capacitance. For the \nMSPD0002 and MSPD1000, the transition time of \nthe SRD will limit the upper frequency to 4 GHz. The \ncircuit in Fig. 2 is designed to work with a sine wave \ndriving the SRD. The SRD can be driven with a \nsquare wave or a pulse. For low frequency                   \n(<20 MHz) references, a pulse drive will work better \nthen sine wave drive. The minimum requirements is \na forward bias cycle of at least 10 ns and a reverse \nbias cycle long enough to remove all the stored \ncharge and allow the SRD to transition. The reverse \nbias cycle should have a fall time less then 0.8 ns. \nThe maximum current in either direction should be \n10 mA and the maximum reverse voltage should be \n13 V. The greater the reverse voltage, the greater \nthe impulse generated. One way to achieve pulse \ndrive is shown in Fig. 4. The circuit uses a constant \ncurrent source to supply the forward bias. Then a \npulse is superimposed to reverse bias the SRD. R is \na minimum of 1000 ohms and C is 0.02 µF. The   \nforward voltage drop of the SRD is about 1 V and \nvaries about -2 mV/°C.  \nOne property of the SPD is that the conversion           \nefficiency varies approximately as sin (npx) / (npx). \nThis is due to the impulse driving the Schottky.           \nMinimum conversion efficiency occurs when (npx) = \nN where n and N are integers. The value of X is  \ncontrolled by the reference frequency and the value \nof the coupling capacitors. When testing a new                        \ndesign, adjusting the microwave frequency is             \nrecommended to insure the circuit is not at a              \nminimum. If the circuit is at a minimum and the           \nreference frequency cannot be changed, the           \ncoupling capacitance can be raised by adding        \nexternal capacitors.  There are several ways to connect a single balanced \nmixer. The circuit in Fig. 2 is based on the circuit \nshown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows another possibility. \nWhen used as a sampling mixer, the SPD has a \nhigh conversion loss (example: Fref = 100 MHz, \nFmicrowave = 1 GHz and FIF = 1 KHz, Conversion \nLoss = 25 dB).  \nFig. 7 shows how IF output varies with microwave \npower at various reference drive levels. For each \nreference drive level there is an optimum microwave \ninput level. Excessive microwave input increases \nphase noise, temperature drift and decreases IF        \noutput.  \nWhen checking the diodes in the SPD with a          \nmultimeter, be sure the voltage is limited to 2 V max-\nimum. While the SPD can be soldered into a circuit \nby hand, limit the time that each lead is heated to 5 \nseconds. Also, observe antistatic                precau-\ntions.
