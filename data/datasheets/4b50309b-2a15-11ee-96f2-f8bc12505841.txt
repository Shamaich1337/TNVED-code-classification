They are designed for use in applications whereboard space is at a premium.  Each device requires lessthan 2.9mm\n2 of PCB area and will protect up to four\nlines.  They are unidirectional devices and may be usedon lines with positive signal polarities.\nThe µclamp\nTM3304A is constructed using  Semtech’s pro-\nprietary EPD process technology. The EPD process pro-vides low standoff voltages with significant reductions inleakage currents and capacitance over silicon-avalanchediode processes.  They feature a true operating voltageof 3.3 volts for superior protection when compared totraditional pn junction devices.\nThese devices may be used to meet the immunity re-\nquirements of IEC 61000-4-2, level 4.  They offer desir-able characteristics for board level protection includingfast response time, low operating and clamping voltage,and no device degradation.  The small SC89 packagemakes them ideal for use in portable electronics such ascell phones, PDAs, notebook computers, and digital cam-eras.\nApplicationsMechanical Characteristics\n\x8bCellular Handsets and Accessories\n\x8bCordless Phones\n\x8bNotebooks and Handhelds\n\x8bPortable Instrumentation\n\x8bDigital Cameras\n\x8bPeripherals\n\x8bMP3 Players\x8bTransient protection for data lines to\nIEC 61000-4-2 (ESD) ±15kV (air), ±8kV (contact)\nIEC 61000-4-4 (EFT) 40A (5/50ns)\n\x8bProtects four unidirectional I/O lines\n\x8bUltra-small SC-89 package ( 1.7 x 1.7 x 0.6mm1.7 x 1.7 x 0.6mm1.7 x 1.7 x 0.6mm1.7 x 1.7 x 0.6mm1.7 x 1.7 x 0.6mm)\nrequires less than 2.9mm2 of PCB area\n\x8bWorking voltage: 3.3V\n\x8bLow leakage current\n\x8bLow operating and clamping voltages\n\x8bSolid-state silicon-avalanche technology\n\x8bSC-89 (SOT-666) package\n\x8bMolding compound flammability rating: UL 94V-0\n\x8bMarking: Marking Code\n\x8bLead Finish: Matte Tin\n\x8bRoHS Compliant\n\x8bWeight: 2.9mg (typical)\n\x8bPackaging: Tape and Reel per EIA 481\nSC-89  (Top View)0.601.70\n1.70 1.25\n0.300.50\nMaximum Dimensions  (mm)\n2 \uf8e9 2005 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSµClamp3304A\nAbsolute Maximum Rating\nElectrical Characteristics (T=25oC)\nretemaraPl obmySs noitidnoCm uminiMl acipyTm umixaMs tinU\negatloVffO-dnatSesreveRVMWR3.3V\negatloVhguorhT-hcnuPVTPITPAµ2=5 .3V\negatloVkcaB-panSVBSIBSAm05=8 .2V\ntnerruCegakaeLesreveRIRVMWRV3.3=5 0.05 .0A µ\negatloVgnipmalCVCIPPsµ02/8=pt,A1=5 .5V\negatloVgnipmalCVCIPPsµ02/8=pt,A5=0 .8V\negatloVgnipmalCesreveRVRCIPPsµ02/8=pt,A1=4 .2V\necnaticapaCnoitcnuJCjdnGotnipO/I\nVRzHM1=f,V0=220 3F p\ndnGotnipO/I\nVRzHM1=f,V3.3=41F pgnitaRl obmySe ulaVs tinU\n)sµ02/8=pt(rewoPesluPkaePPkp04s ttaW\n(tnerruCesluPkaePmumixaM) sµ02/8=ptIpp5s pmA\n)riA(2-4-00016CEIrepDSE\n)tcatnoC(2-4-00016CEIrepDSEVPP02-/+\n51-/+Vk\nerutarepmeTgniredloSdaeLTL).ces01(062C °\nerutarepmeTgnitarepOTJ521+ot55-C °\nerutarepmeTegarotSTGTS051+ot55-C °\n3 \uf8e9 2005 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSµClamp3304A\nTypical Characteristics\nNon-Repetitive Peak Pulse Power vs. Pulse Time\n0102030405060708090100110\n0 2 55 07 5 1 0 0 1 2 5 1 5 0\nAmbient Temperature - TA (oC)% of Rated Power or I PPPower Derating Curve\nClamping Voltage vs. Peak Pulse Current Junction Capacitance vs. Reverse Voltage\nForward Voltage vs Forward Current ESD Clamping\n(8kV Contact per IEC 61000-4-2)0.05.010.015.020.025.0\n00 . 511 . 522 . 533 . 5\nReverse Voltage - VR (V)Capacitance - C j (pF)f = 1 MHz\n024681012\n012345\nPeak Pulse Current - IPP (A)Clamping Voltage - VC (V)\nWaveform\n Parameters:\ntr = 8µs\ntd = 20µs\n0.010.11\n0.1 1 10 100 1000\nPulse Duration - tp (µs)Peak Pulse Power - P PP (kW)\n01234567\n0123456\nForward Current - IF (A)Forward Voltage - VF (V)\nWaveform\n Parameters:\ntr = 8 µs\ntd = 20 µs\n4 \uf8e9 2005 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSµClamp3304A\nCircuit Diagram\nProtection of Four Unidirectional LinesDevice Connection for Protection of Four Data Lines\nThese devices are designed to protect up to four\nunidirectional data lines. The device is connected asfollows:\n1. Unidirectional protection of four I/O lines is\nachieved by connecting pins 1, 3, 4, and 6 to thedata lines.  Pins 2 and 5 are connected to ground.The ground connection should be made directly tothe ground plane for best results.  The path lengthis kept as short as possible to reduce the effectsof parasitic inductance in the board traces.\nCircuit Board Layout Recommendations for Suppres-\nsion of ESD.\nGood circuit board layout is critical for the suppression\nof ESD induced transients.  The following guidelines arerecommended:\nzPlace the TVS near the input terminals or connec-tors to restrict transient coupling.\nzMinimize the path length between the TVS and theprotected line.\nzMinimize all conductive loops including power andground loops.\nzThe ESD transient return path to ground should bekept as short as possible.\nzNever run critical signals near board edges.\nzUse ground planes whenever possible.\nMatte Tin Lead Finish\nMatte tin has become the industry standard lead-free\nreplacement for SnPb lead finishes.  A matte tin finishis composed of 100% tin solder with large grains.Since the solder volume on the leads is small com-pared to the solder paste volume that is placed on theland pattern of the PCB, the reflow profile will bedetermined by the requirements of the solder paste.Therefore, these devices are compatible with bothlead-free and SnPb assembly techniques.  In addition,unlike other lead-free compositions, matte tin does nothave any added alloys that can cause degradation ofthe solder joint.Applications Information\n2, 513 46\n5 \uf8e9 2005 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSµClamp3304A\nTypical Applications\nuClamp3304A\n6 \uf8e9 2005 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSµClamp3304A\nApplications Information - Spice Model\nFigure 1 - µClamp3304A Spice Model\nsretemaraPecipSA4033pmalCµ-1elbaT\nretemaraPt inU) SVT(1D) DRCL(2D\nSIp mA0 2-E00.10 2-E00.1\nVBt loV7 4.38\nJVt loV4 10 7.0\nSRm hO7 37.05 97.0\nVBIp mA3 -E0.13 -E0.1\nOJCd araF2 1-E35.412 1-E6\nTTc es9 -E145.29 -E145.2\nM- -2 51.02 51.0\nN- -1 .11 .1\nGEV e1 1.11 1.1\n7 \uf8e9 2005 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSµClamp3304A\nOutline Drawing - SC-89 (SOT-666)\nLand Pattern - SC-89 (SOT-666)INCHES\n.063\nNc\nE1E\nLD .059\n.043DIM\nAMIN\n.019\n1.70\n1.251.50\n1.10\n6-\n.008.063\n.047.067\n.049\n6-\n0.201.60\n1.201.60MILLIMETERS\nMAX\n0.60MINDIMENSIONS\nMAX NOM\n-.024NOM\n0.50 -1A\nB\nC\nCONTROLLING DIMENSIONS ARE IN MILLIMETERS (ANGLES IN DEGREES).NOTES:\nOR GATE BURRS.DIMENSIONS "E1" AND "D" DO NOT INCLUDE MOLD FLASH, PROTRUSIONS2.1.1.70 1.55 .061 .067\n0.30 0.10 .012 .003\nL1 .003 .006 0.15 0.10 .008 0.20b .005 -- 0.15 .012 0.30\ne .020 BSC 0.50 BSC0.18 0.10 .007 .003aaa CA-B DD\ne\nNxb2E/2D\nE1E\ncLN\nA\nL1\naaa .004 0.10\nNOTES:\n1.THIS LAND PATTERN IS FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY\nCONSULT YOUR MANUFACTURING GROUP TO ENSURE YOURCOMPANY\'S MANUFACTURING GUIDELINES ARE MET.DIM\nY\nZG\nXCMILLIMETERS INCHES\n(1.45)\n.033\n.090.012.024(.057)\n0.85\n2.300.300.60DIMENSIONS\nZX\nY\nCG\nYP 0.50 .020\nP\n8 \uf8e9 2005 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSµClamp3304A\nContact Information\nSemtech Corporation\nProtection Products Division\n200 Flynn Rd., Camarillo, CA 93012\nPhone: (805)498-2111   FAX (805)498-3804Marking Code Ordering Information\nNote:(1) Device is symmetrical so there is no pin 1 identifier\nTape and Reel Specification\nTape Specifications and Device OrientationNote: Lead finish is lead-free matte tin\nMicroClamp, uClamp and µClamp are trademarks of Semtech\nCorporationrebmuNtraPgnikroW\negatloVeciveD\ngnikraMrepytQ\nleeRleeR\neziS\nTCT.A4033pmalCuV 3.3S S0 00,3h cnI7\nSS\nSS SS SS\n'}]
