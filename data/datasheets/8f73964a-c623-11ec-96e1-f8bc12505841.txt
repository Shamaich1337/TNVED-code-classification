This makes the\nTLS805B1 also suitable to supply automotive systems that need to operate during cranking condition.\nInternal protection features like output current li mitation and overtemperatur e shutdown are implemented\nto protect the device against immediate damage due to fa ilures like output short ci rcuit to GND, over-current\nand over-temperature. \nThe device can be switched on and off by the Enable fe ature. When the device is switched off, the current\nconsumption is typically less than 1 µA.\nChoosing External Components\nAn input capacitor CI is recommended to compensate line  influences. The output capacitor CQ is necessary for\nthe stability of the regulating circuit.  Stability is guar anteed at values CQ≥ 1µ F  a n d  a n  E S R  ≤ 100Ω within the\nwhole operating range.\nData Sheet 4 Rev. 1.2 2016-01-11\n TLS805B1SJ/LDV\n \nBlock Diagram\n2 Block Diagram\nFigure 3 Block Diagram TLS805B1Bandgap \nReference\nGNDQ I\nTemperature \nShutdownEN\nEnableCurrent \nLimitation\nADJ\nData Sheet 5 Rev. 1.2 2016-01-11\n TLS805B1SJ/LDV\n \nPin Configuration\n3 Pin Configuration\n3.1 Pin Assignment in PG-DSO-8 Package\nFigure 4 Pin Configuration TLS805B1 in PG-DSO-8 package\n3.2 Pin Definitions and Functions in PG-DSO-8 Package\nPin Symbol Function\n1I Input\nIt is recommended to place a small ceramic capacitor (e.g. 100 nF) to GND, close \nto the IC terminals, in order to compensate li ne influences.\n2N .

This fractional voltage is compared to an internal\nvoltage reference and the pass tran sistor is driven accordingly.\nThe control loop stability depe nds on the output capacitor CQ, the load current, the chip temperature and the\ninternal circuit structure. To ensure stable operatio n, the output capacitor’s ca pacitance and its equivalent\nseries resistor ESR requirements given in “Functional Range” on Page 9  have to be maintained. For details\nsee the typical pe rformance graph Output Capacitor Series Resistor ESR(CQ) versus Output Current IQ.\nSince the output capacitor is used to buffer load steps, it should be size d according to the application’s needs.\nAn input capacitor CI is not required for stability, but is reco mmended to compensate line fluctuations. An\nadditional reverse polarity protection diode and a comb ination of several capacito rs for filtering should be\nused, in case the input is connected directly to the ba ttery line. Connect the capaci tors close to the regulator\nterminals.\nIn order to prevent overshoots during start-up, a smoot h ramping up function is implemented. This ensures\nalmost no overshoots during start-up, mostly independent from load and output capacitance.\nWhenever the load current ex ceeds the specified limit, e. g. in case of a short circuit, the output current is\nlimited and the output  voltage decreases. \nThe overtemperature shutdown circui t prevents the IC from immediate destruction under fault conditions\n(e.g. output continuously short-circui t) by switching off the power stage. After the chip has cooled down, the\nregulator restarts. This oscillator y thermal behaviour causes the junc tion temperature to exceed the\nmaximum rating of 150°C and can signif icantly reduce the IC’s lifetime.\nFigure 6 Block Diagram Voltage RegulationBandgap \nReference\nGNDQ I\nTemperature \nShutdownCurrent \nLimitation\nADJRegulated \nOutput VoltageIQ\nVQR1\nR2CQSupply\nVILOADC\nESR\nCIII\nData Sheet 12 Rev. 1.2 2016-01-11\n TLS805B1SJ/LDV\n \nBlock Description and Elec trical Characteristics\nTable 5 Electrical Characteristics\nTj = -40 °C to +150 °C, VI = 13.5 V, all voltages with respect to  ground (unless otherwise specified). \nTypical values are given at Tj = 25 °C, VI = 13.5 V.\nParameter Symbol Values Unit Note or Test Condition Number\nMin.

This capacitor must be placed very close to\nthe input pin of the linear vo ltage regulator on the PCB. \nAn aluminum electrolytic capacitor in the range of 10 µF to 470 µF is recommended as an input buffer to\nsmooth out high energy pulses, such as ISO pulse 2a. This  capacitor should be placed close to the input pin of\nthe linear voltage regulator on the PCB.\nAn overvoltage suppressor diode can be used to further suppress any high voltage beyond the maximum\nrating of the linear voltage regulator and protect the device against any damage due to over-voltage.\nThe external components at the input are not mandator y for the operation of the voltage regulator, but they\nare recommended in case of po ssible external disturbances.TLS805B1Q I\nEN\nADJRegulated \nOutput VoltageIQ\nCQ\n1μFSupply\n100nF 10μFCI1 CI2\n<45VDI2II\nGNDe.g. Ignition\nLoad\n(e.g.\nMicro \nController)\nGNDR1DI1\nR2\nData Sheet 21 Rev. 1.2 2016-01-11\n TLS805B1SJ/LDV\n \nApplication Information\n6.2.2 Output Pin\nAn output capacitor is mandatory for the stability of linear voltage regulators. \nThe requirement to the outp ut capacitor is given in “Functional Range” on Page 9 .

According to the automotive\nenvironment, ceramic capacitors with X5R or X7R dielectrics are recommended.\nThe output capacitor should be placed as close as poss ible to the regulator’s outp ut and GND pins and on the\nsame side of the PCB as the regulator itself.\nI n  c a s e  o f  r a p i d  t r a n s i e n t s  o f  i n put voltage or load curr ent, the capacitance sh ould be dimensioned in\naccordance and verified in the real application th at the output stability requirements are fulfilled.\n6.3 Output Voltage Adjust\nThe output voltage of TLS805B1SJ/LDV can be adjusted between 1.2 V and VI-Vdr by an external resistor\ndivider, connected to the ad just pin ADJ, as shown in Figure 7 .\nThe pin ADJ is connected to the error amplifier comparing the voltage at th is pin with the internal reference\nvoltage of typically 1.2 V.\nThe output voltage can be easily calculated, ne glecting the current flowing into the ADJ pin:\n(6.1)\nwith\n•Vref: internal reference voltage, typically 1.2V\n•R1: resistor between regulator output Q and adjust pin ADJ\n•R2: resistor between adjust pin ADJ and GND\nThe bigger the resistors R1 and R2, the less the current flowing through th e resistor divider. However, using too\nbig resistors makes the current flowing into the ADJ pin non-negligible. In oder to neglect the current flowing\ninto the ADJ pin,  the values of R1 and R2 should be selected fulfilling the criteria R2 ≤ 250 kΩ. \nTo set the output voltage to 1.2 V, the adjust pin AD J should be directly connected to the output pin Q.\nTake into consideration that an additional error to the output voltage tolerance may be introduced by the\naccuracy of the resistors R1 and R2.\n6.4 Thermal Considerations\nKnowing the input voltage, the output voltage and th e load profile of the application, the total power\ndissipation can be calculated:\n(6.2)\nwith\n•PD: continuous power dissipation\n•VI: input voltage\n•VQ: output voltageVQR1R2+\nR2------------------- Vref× =\nPDVIVQ–() IQVIIq× +× =\nData Sheet 22 Rev. 1.2 2016-01-11\n TLS805B1SJ/LDV\n \nApplication Information\n•IQ: output current\n•Iq: quiescent current\nThe maximum acceptable thermal resistance RthJA can then be calculated:\n(6.3)\nwith\n•Tj,max : maximum allowed junction temperature\n•Ta: ambient temperature\nBased on the above calculation the proper PCB type and the necessary heat sink area can be determined with\nreference to the specification in “Thermal Resistance” on Page 10 .\nExample\nApplication conditions:\nVI= 13.5 V\nVQ= 5 V\nIQ= 35 mA\nTa= 105 °C\nCalculation of RthJA,max :\nPD=(VI – VQ) x IQ + VI x Iq\n= (13.5V – 5V) x 35 mA + 13.5 V x 0.0115 mA\n= 0.2975 W\nRthJA,max =(Tj,max  – Ta) / PD\n= (150 °C – 105 °C) / 0.2975 W \n= 151.2 K/W\nAs a result, the PCB design must ensure a thermal resistance RthJA lower than 151.2 K/W. According to\n“Thermal Resistance” on Page 10 , for both TLS805B1SJV and TLS805B 1LDV at least 300 mm² heatsink area\nis needed on the FR4 1s0p PCB, or  the FR4 2s2p board can be used.\n6.5 Reverse Polarity Protection\nTLS805B1 is not self protected agains t reverse polarity faults. To prot ect the device against negative supply\nvoltage, an external reverse polari ty diode is needed, as shown in Figure 7 . The absolute maximum ratings of\nthe device as specified in “Absolute Maximum Ratings” on Page 8  must be kept.\n6.6 Further Application Information\n• For further information you may contact http://www.infineon.com/RthJA max,Tjm a x,Ta–\nPD--------------------------- - =\nData Sheet 23 Rev. 1.2 2016-01-11\n TLS805B1SJ/LDV\n \nPackage Outlines\n7 Package Outlines\nFigure 8 PG-DSO-8 0.35 x 45°\n1)\n-0.24\nC\n+0.06\n0.19\n0.64\n±0.26±0.25\n0.2 8x MC1.27\n+0.10.41\n0.2 MA-0.068xSEATING PLANE\nB2)\nIndex M arking4 18 5\n5-0.21)A\n1) Doe s not incl ude plastic or met al protr usion of 0.15 m ax. per side\n2) Le ad width c an be 0.61 m ax. in d ambar area1.75 MAX.(1.45)±0.07 0.175\nB0.1\nPG-D SO-8-16, -24, -25, -2 8, -31, -33, -36, -44, -49- PO   V068° MAX.\nData Sheet 24 Rev. 1.2 2016-01-11\n TLS805B1SJ/LDV\n \nPackage Outlines\nFigure 9 PG-TSON-10 \nGreen Product (RoHS compliant)\nTo meet the world-wide customer requirements for en vironmentally friendly products and to be compliant\nwith government regulations the device is available as a green product.
