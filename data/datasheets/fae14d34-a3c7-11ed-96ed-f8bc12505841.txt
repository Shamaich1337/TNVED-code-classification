Internal compensation reduces design complexity and external \ncomponent count.\nThe integrated 110-m Ω high-side MOSFET supports high-efficiency power-supply designs capable of delivering \n5-A of continuous current to a load. The gate-drive bias voltage for the integrated high-side MOSFET is supplied \nby a bootstrap capacitor connected from the BOOT to PH pins. The TPS5450 device reduces the external \ncomponent count by integrating the bootstrap recharge diode.\nThe TPS5450 device has a default input start-up voltage of 5.3 V typical. The ENA pin can be used to disable \nthe TPS5450 reducing the supply current to 18 µA. An internal pullup current source enables operation when \nthe EN pin is floating. The TPS5450 includes an internal slow-start circuit that slows the output rise time during \nstart-up to reduce in rush current and output voltage overshoot.\nThe minimum output voltage is the internal 1.221-V feedback reference. Output overvoltage transients are \nminimized by an Overvoltage Protection (OVP) comparator. When the OVP comparator is activated, the high-\nside MOSFET is turned off and remains off until the output voltage is less than 112.5% of the desired output \nvoltage.\nInternal cycle-by-cycle overcurrent protection limits the peak current in the integrated high-side MOSFET. For \ncontinuous overcurrent fault conditions the TPS5450 will enter hiccup mode overcurrent limiting. Thermal \nprotection protects the device from overheating.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVIN\nUVLO\nENABLE\nThermal\nProtectionReference\nOvercurrent\nGate□DriveOscillatorRamp\nGeneratorVREF\nPHENA\nGND\nBOOTZ 1\nZ2\nSHDNSHDN\nSHDNSHDNSHDNSHDN\nSHDNSHDN\nVIN\n112.5%□VREFVSENSE OVPHICCUPHICCUP\nSHDNNCFeed□ForwardBOOT\nNC\nPOWERPADVIN\nVOUT5 µA1.221□V□BandgapSlow□StartBoot\nRegulator\nError\nAmplifier\nGain□=□25\nPWM\nComparator\nProtection\nGate\nDriverControlVSENSEwww.ti.comTPS5450\nSLVS757E – MARCH 2007 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5450\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Oscillator Frequency\nThe internal free running oscillator sets the PWM switching frequency at 500 kHz. The 500-kHz switching \nfrequency allows less output inductance for the same output ripple requirement resulting in a smaller output \ninductor.\n7.3.2 Voltage Reference\nThe voltage reference system produces a precision reference signal by scaling the output of a temperature \nstable band-gap circuit. The band-gap and scaling circuits are trimmed during production testing to an output of \n1.221\u2009V at room temperature.\n7.3.3 Enable (ENA) and Internal Slow-Start\nThe ENA pin provides electrical on and off control of the regulator. Once the ENA pin voltage exceeds the \nthreshold voltage, the regulator starts operation and the internal slow-start begins to ramp. If the ENA pin voltage \nis pulled below the threshold voltage, the regulator stops switching and the internal slow-start resets. Connecting \nthe pin-to-ground or to any voltage less than 0.5 V will disable the regulator and activate the shutdown mode. \nThe quiescent current of the TPS5450 in shutdown mode is typically 18 μA.\nThe ENA pin has an internal pullup current source, allowing the user to float the ENA pin. If an application \nrequires controlling the ENA pin, use open-drain or open-collector output logic to interface with the pin. To limit \nthe start-up inrush current, an internal slow-start circuit is used to ramp up the reference voltage from 0 \u2009 V to its \nfinal value, linearly. The internal slow-start time is 8 ms typically.\n7.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nThe TPS5450 incorporates an UVLO circuit to keep the device disabled when VIN (the input voltage) is below \nthe UVLO start voltage threshold. During power-up, internal circuits are held inactive and the internal slow-start \nis grounded until VIN exceeds the UVLO start threshold voltage. Once the UVLO start threshold voltage is \nreached, the internal slow-start is released and device start-up begins. The device operates until VIN falls below \nthe UVLO stop threshold voltage. The typical hysteresis in the UVLO comparator is 330\u2009 mV.\n7.3.5 Boost Capacitor (BOOT)\nConnect a 0.01- μF, low-ESR ceramic capacitor between the BOOT pin and PH pin. This capacitor provides the \ngate-drive voltage for the high-side MOSFET. X7R or X5R grade dielectrics are recommended due to their stable \nvalues over temperature.\n7.3.6 Output Feedback (VSENSE) and Internal Compensation\nThe output voltage of the regulator is set by feeding back the center point voltage of an external resistor divider \nnetwork to the VSENSE pin. In steady-state operation, the VSENSE pin voltage should be equal to the voltage \nreference 1.221\u2009V.\nThe TPS5450 implements internal compensation to simplify the regulator design. Since the TPS5450 uses \nvoltage mode control, a type 3 compensation network has been designed on chip to provide a high crossover \nfrequency and a high phase margin for good stability. See the Section 8.2.2.9.2  for more details.\n7.3.7 Voltage Feed-Forward\nThe internal voltage feed-forward provides a constant DC power stage gain despite any variations with the input \nvoltage. This greatly simplifies the stability analysis and improves the transient response. Voltage feed-forward \nvaries the peak ramp voltage inversely with the input voltage so that the modulator and power stage gain are \nconstant at the feed-forward gain, that is.\nFeed Forward Gain =VIN\nRamppk – pk\n(1)\nThe typical feed-forward gain of TPS5450 is 25.TPS5450\nSLVS757E – MARCH 2007 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5450\n7.3.8 Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) Control\nThe regulator employs a fixed frequency pulse-width-modulator (PWM) control method. First, the feedback \nvoltage (VSENSE pin voltage) is compared to the constant voltage reference by the high-gain error amplifier and \ncompensation network to produce a error voltage. Then, the error voltage is compared to the ramp voltage by \nthe PWM comparator. In this way, the error voltage magnitude is converted to a pulse width which is the duty \ncycle. Finally, the PWM output is fed into the gate-drive circuit to control the on-time of the high-side MOSFET.\n7.3.9 Overcurrent Limiting\nOvercurrent limiting is implemented by sensing the drain-to-source voltage across the high-side MOSFET. The \ndrain to source voltage is then compared to a voltage level representing the overcurrent threshold limit. If the \ndrain-to-source voltage exceeds the overcurrent threshold limit, the overcurrent indicator is set true. The system \nwill ignore the overcurrent indicator for the leading edge blanking time at the beginning of each cycle to avoid \nany turn-on noise glitches.\nOnce overcurrent indicator is set true, overcurrent limiting is triggered. The high-side MOSFET is turned off for \nthe rest of the cycle after a propagation delay. The overcurrent limiting mode is called cycle-by-cycle current \nlimiting.\nSometimes under serious overload conditions such as short-circuit, the overcurrent runaway may still happen \nwhen using cycle-by-cycle current limiting. A second mode of current limiting is used, that is, hiccup mode \novercurrent limiting. During hiccup mode overcurrent limiting, the voltage reference is grounded and the high-\nside MOSFET is turned off for the hiccup time. Once the hiccup time duration is complete, the regulator restarts \nunder control of the slow-start circuit.\n7.3.10 Overvoltage Protection\nThe TPS5450 has an overvoltage protection (OVP) circuit to minimize voltage overshoot when recovering from \noutput fault conditions. The OVP circuit includes an overvoltage comparator to compare the VSENSE pin voltage \nand a threshold of 112.5% x VREF. Once the VSENSE pin voltage is higher than the threshold, the high-side \nMOSFET will be forced off. When the VSENSE pin voltage drops lower than the threshold, the high-side \nMOSFET will be enabled again.\n7.3.11 Thermal Shutdown\nThe TPS5450 protects itself from overheating with an internal thermal shutdown circuit. If the junction \ntemperature exceeds the thermal shutdown trip point, the voltage reference is grounded and the high-side \nMOSFET is turned off. The part is restarted under control of the slow-start circuit automatically when the junction \ntemperature drops 14°C below the thermal shutdown trip point.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Operation near Minimum Input Voltage\nThe device is recommended to operate with input voltages above 5.5 V. The typical VIN UVLO threshold is \n5.3 V and the device may operate at input voltages down to the UVLO voltage. At input voltages below the \nactual UVLO voltage the device will not switch. If EN is floating or externally pulled up to greater up than 1.3 V, \nwhen V (VIN) passes the UVLO threshold the device will become active. Switching is enabled and the slow-start \nsequence is initiated. The TPS5450 device starts linearly ramping up the internal reference voltage from 0 V to \nits final value over the internal slow-start time.\n7.4.2 Operation With ENA Control\nThe enable start threshold voltage is 1.3 V maximum. With ENA held below the 0.5-V minimum stop threshold \nvoltage the device is disabled and switching is inhibited even if VIN is above its UVLO threshold. The IC \nquiescent current is reduced in this state. If he EN voltage is increased above the threshold while VIN is above \nits UVLO threshold, the device becomes active. Switching is enabled and the slow-start sequence is initiated. \nThe TPS5450 device starts linearly ramping up the internal reference voltage from 0 V to its final value over the \ninternal slow-start time.www.ti.comTPS5450\nSLVS757E – MARCH 2007 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5450\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe TPS5450 device is a 36-V, 5-A, step-down regulator with an integrated high-side MOSFET.

Use the following design procedure to select \ncomponent values for the TPS5450 device. This procedure illustrates the design of a high-frequency switching \nregulator.\n8.2 Typical Application\nFigure 8-1  shows the schematic for a typical TPS5450 application. The TPS5450 can provide up to 5-A output \ncurrent at a nominal output voltage of 5 V.

Alternately, use \nthe WEBENCH software to generate a complete design. The WEBENCH software uses an iterative design \nprocedure and accesses a comprehensive database of components when generating a design. This section \npresents a simplified discussion of the design process.\n8.2.2.1 Switching Frequency\nThe switching frequency for the TPS5450 is internally set to 500 kHz. It is not possible to adjust the switching \nfrequency.\n8.2.2.2 Output Voltage Setpoint\nThe output voltage of the TPS5450 is set by a resistor divider (R1 and R2) from the output to the VSENSE pin. \nCalculate the R2 resistor value for the output voltage of 5 V using Equation 2 :\n(2)\nFor any TPS5450 design, start with an R1 value of 10 k Ω. For an output voltage closest to but at least 5 V, R2 is \n3.16 kΩ.\n8.2.2.3 Input Capacitors\nThe TPS5450 requires an input decoupling capacitor and, depending on the application, a bulk input capacitor. \nThe minimum recommended decoupling capacitance is 4.7 μF. A high-quality ceramic type X5R or X7R is \nrequired. For some applications, a smaller value decoupling capacitor may be used, so long as the input voltage \nand current ripple ratings are not exceeded. The voltage rating must be greater than the maximum input voltage, \nincluding ripple.\nThis input ripple voltage can be approximated by Equation 3 :\nΔVINIOUT(MAX)× 0.25\nCBULK ƒswIOUT(MAX)ESRMAX=\n×= ×\n(3)\nwhere\n•IOUT(MAX)  is the maximum load current\n•f SW is the switching frequency\n•CIN is the input capacitor value\n•ESR MAX is the maximum series resistance of the input capacitor\nFor this design, the input capacitance consists of two 4.7- μF capacitors, C1 and C4, in parallel. An additional \nhigh frequency bypass capacitor, C5 is also used.\nThe maximum RMS ripple current also needs to be checked. For worst case conditions, this can be \napproximated by Equation 4 :\nICINIOUT(MAX)\n2=\n(4)\nIn this case the input ripple voltage would be 281 mV and the RMS ripple current would be 2.5 A. The maximum \nvoltage across the input capacitors would be VIN max plus delta VIN/2. The chosen input decoupling capacitor \nis rated for 50 V and the ripple current capacity is greater than 2.5 A each, providing ample margin. It is very \nimportant that the maximum ratings for voltage and current are not exceeded under any circumstance.\nAdditionally some bulk capacitance may be needed, especially if the TPS5450 circuit is not located within about \n2 inches from the input voltage source. The value for this capacitor is not critical but it also should be rated to www.ti.comTPS5450\nSLVS757E – MARCH 2007 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5450\nhandle the maximum input voltage including ripple voltage and should filter the output so that input ripple voltage \nis acceptable.\n8.2.2.4 Output Filter Components\nTwo components need to be selected for the output filter, L1 and C2. Since the TPS5450 is an internally \ncompensated device, a limited range of filter component types and values can be supported.\n8.2.2.5 Inductor Selection\nTo calculate the minimum value of the output inductor, use Equation 5 :\nLMINVOUT(MAX)VIN(MAX)VOUT\nVIN(MAX)× KIND× IOUT× FSW(MIN)=×( )–\n(5)\nKIND is a coefficient that represents the amount of inductor ripple current relative to the maximum output current. \nThree things need to be considered when determining the amount of ripple current in the inductor: the peak \nto peak ripple current affects the output ripple voltage amplitude, the ripple current affects the peak switch \ncurrent and the amount of ripple current determines at what point the circuit becomes discontinuous. For designs \nusing the TPS5450, K IND of 0.2 to 0.3 yields good results. Low-output ripple voltages can be obtained when \npaired with the proper output capacitor, the peak switch current will be well below the current limit set point and \nrelatively low-load currents can be sourced before discontinuous operation.\nFor this design example use K IND = 0.2 and the minimum inductor value is calculated to be 10.4 μH. A higher \nstandard value is 15 μH, which is used in this design.\nFor the output filter inductor it is important that the RMS current and saturation current ratings not be exceeded. \nThe RMS inductor current can be found from Equation 6 :\nIL(RMS)/C0043 I2\nOUT(MAX)/C00411\n12/C0032/C0466VOUT/C0032/C0466VIN(MAX)/C0042VOUT/C0467\nVIN(MAX)/C0032LOUT/C0032FSW(MIN)/C04672/C0504\n(6)\nThe peak inductor current can be determined with Equation 7 :\nIL(PK)/C0043IOUT(MAX)/C0041VOUT/C0032/C0466VIN(MAX)/C0042VOUT/C0467\n1.6/C0032VIN(MAX)/C0032LOUT/C0032FSW(MIN)\n(7)\nFor this design, the RMS inductor current is 5.004 A, and the peak inductor current is 5.34 A. The chosen \ninductor is a Sumida CDRH1127/LD-150 15 μH. It has a minimum rated current of 5.65 A for both saturation and \nRMS current. In general, inductor values for use with the TPS5450 are in the range of 10 μH to 100 μH.\n8.2.2.6 Capacitor Selection\nThe important design factors for the output capacitor are DC voltage rating, ripple current rating, and equivalent \nseries resistance (ESR). The DC voltage and ripple current ratings cannot be exceeded. The ESR is important \nbecause along with the inductor ripple current it determines the amount of output ripple voltage. The actual value \nof the output capacitor is not critical, but some practical limits do exist. Consider the relationship between the \ndesired closed-loop crossover frequency of the design and LC corner frequency of the output filter. Due to the \ndesign of the internal compensation, it is desirable to keep the closed-loop crossover frequency in the range 3 \nkHz to 30 kHz as this frequency range has adequate phase boost to allow for stable operation. For this design \nexample, it is assumed that the intended closed-loop crossover frequency will be between 2590 Hz and 24 \nkHz and also below the ESR zero of the output capacitor. Under these conditions the closed-loop crossover \nfrequency is related to the LC corner frequency by:TPS5450\nSLVS757E – MARCH 2007 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5450\nfCO/C0043fLC2\n85 VOUT(8)\nAnd the desired output capacitor value for the output filter to:\nCOUT/C00431\n3357/C0032LOUT/C0032fCO/C0032VOUT\n(9)\nFor a desired crossover of 12 kHz and a 15- μH inductor, the calculated value for the output capacitor is 330 \nμF.

The maximum ESR \nshould be:\nESRMAX/C00431\n2/C0112/C0032COUT/C0032fCO\n(10)\nThe maximum ESR of the output capacitor also determines the amount of output ripple as specified in the initial \ndesign parameters. The output ripple voltage is the inductor ripple current times the ESR of the output filter. \nCheck that the maximum specified ESR as listed in the capacitor data sheet results in an acceptable output \nripple voltage:\nV (MAX)□=PP(□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□) ESR x□□V x□□□□V -□□VMAX OUT IN(MAX) OUT\nN x□□V x□□LC IN(MAX) OUTx□□FSW\n(11)\nwhere\n•ΔVPP is the desired peak-to-peak output ripple.\n•NC is the number of parallel output capacitors.\n•FSW is the switching frequency.\nFor this design example, a single 330- μF output capacitor is chosen for C3. The calculated RMS ripple current \nis 143 mA and the maximum ESR required is 40 m Ω. A capacitor that meets these requirements is a Sanyo \nPoscap 10TPB330M, rated at 10 V with a maximum ESR of 35 m Ω and a ripple current rating of 3 A. An \nadditional small 0.1-μF ceramic bypass capacitor, C6 is also used in this design.\nThe minimum ESR of the output capacitor should also be considered. For good phase margin, the ESR zero \nwhen the ESR is at a minimum should not be too far above the internal compensation poles at 24 kHz and 54 \nkHz.\nThe selected output capacitor must also be rated for a voltage greater than the desired output voltage plus one \nhalf the ripple voltage. Any derating amount must also be included.

The selected diode \nmust meet the absolute maximum ratings for the application: Reverse voltage must be higher than the maximum \nvoltage at the PH pin, which is V INMAX  + 0.5 V. Peak current must be greater than I OUTMAX  plus on half the peak \nto peak inductor current. Forward voltage drop should be small for higher efficiencies. It is important to note that \nthe catch diode conduction time is typically longer than the high-side FET on-time, so attention paid to diode \nparameters can make a marked improvement in overall efficiency. Additionally, check that the device chosen is \ncapable of dissipating the power losses. For this design, a Diodes, Inc. B540A is chosen, with a reverse voltage \nof 40 V, forward current of 5 A, and a forward voltage drop of 0.5 V.\n8.2.2.9 Advanced Information\n8.2.2.9.1 Output Voltage Limitations\nDue to the internal design of the TPS5450, there are both upper and lower output voltage limits for any given \ninput voltage. The upper limit of the output voltage set point is constrained by the maximum duty cycle of 87% \nand is given by:\nVOUTMAX/C00430.87/C0032/C0466/C0466VINMIN/C0042IOMAX/C00320.230/C0467/C0041VD/C0467/C0042/C0466IOMAX/C0032RL/C0467/C0042VD\n(13)\nwhere\n•VINMIN  = minimum input voltage\n•IOMAX  = maximum load current\n•VD = catch diode forward voltage.\n•RL= output inductor series resistance.\nThis equation assumes maximum on resistance for the internal high-side FET.\nThe lower limit is constrained by the minimum controllable on time which may be as high as 200 ns. The \napproximate minimum output voltage for a given input voltage and minimum load current is given by:\nVOUTMIN/C00430.12/C0032/C0466/C0466VINMAX/C0042IOMIN/C00320.110/C0467/C0041VD/C0467/C0042/C0466IOMIN/C0032RL/C0467/C0042VD\n(14)\nwhere\n•VINMAX  = maximum input voltage\n•IOMIN = minimum load current\n•VD = catch diode forward voltage.\n•RL= output inductor series resistance.\nThis equation assumes nominal on resistance for the high-side FET and accounts for worst case variation of \noperating frequency set point. Any design operating near the operational limits of the device should be carefully \nchecked to assure proper functionality.\n8.2.2.9.2 Internal Compensation Network\nThe design equations given in the example circuit can be used to generate circuits using the TPS5450. These \ndesigns are based on certain assumptions and will tend to always select output capacitors within a limited \nrange of ESR values. If a different capacitor type is desired, it may be possible to fit one to the internal \ncompensation of the TPS5450. Equation 15  gives the nominal frequency response of the internal voltage-mode \ntype III compensation network:\nH(s)/C0043/C04661/C0041s\n2/C0112/C0032Fz1/C0467/C0032/C04661/C0041s\n2/C0112/C0032Fz2/C0467\n/C0466s\n2/C0112/C0032Fp0/C0467/C0032/C04661/C0041s\n2/C0112/C0032Fp1/C0467/C0032/C04661/C0041s\n2/C0112/C0032Fp2/C0467/C0032/C04661/C0041s\n2/C0112/C0032Fp3/C0467\n(15)TPS5450\nSLVS757E – MARCH 2007 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5450\nwhere\n•Fp0 = 2165 Hz, Fz1 = 2170 Hz, Fz2 = 2590 Hz\n•Fp1 = 24 kHz, Fp2 = 54 kHz, Fp3 = 440 kHz\n•Fp3 represents the non-ideal parasitics effect.\nUsing this information along with the desired output voltage, feed-forward gain and output filter characteristics, \nthe closed-loop transfer function can be derived.www.ti.comTPS5450\nSLVS757E – MARCH 2007 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5450\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nThe performance graphs ( Figure 8-2  through Figure 8-8 ) are applicable to the circuit in Figure 8-1 .

TPS5450 Power Dissipation vs Junction Temperature.\n9 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe device is designed to operate from an input voltage supply range between 5.5 V and 36 V. This input supply \nshould be well regulated. If the input supply is located more than a few inches from the TPS5450 converter \nadditional bulk capacitance may be required in addition to the ceramic bypass capacitors. An electrolytic \ncapacitor with a value of 100 μF is a typical choice.\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nConnect a low-ESR ceramic bypass capacitor to the VIN pin. Take care to minimize the loop area formed by the \nbypass capacitor connections, the VIN pin, and the TPS5450 ground pin. The best way to do this is to extend the \ntop-side ground area from under the device adjacent to the VIN trace, and place the bypass capacitor as close \nas possible to the VIN pin. The minimum recommended bypass capacitance is 4.7- μF ceramic with a X5R or \nX7R dielectric.\nThere should be a ground area on the top layer directly underneath the IC, with an exposed area for connection \nto the PowerPAD. Use vias to connect this ground area to any internal ground planes. Use additional vias at the \nground side of the input and output filter capacitors as well. The GND pin should be tied to the PCB ground by \nconnecting it to the ground area under the device as shown below.\nThe PH pin should be routed to the output inductor, catch diode and boot capacitor. Since the PH connection is \nthe switching node, the inductor should be located very close to the PH pin and the area of the PCB conductor \nminimized to prevent excessive capacitive coupling. The catch diode should also be placed close to the device \nto minimize the output current loop area. Connect the boot capacitor between the phase node and the BOOT \npin as shown. Keep the boot capacitor close to the IC and minimize the conductor trace lengths. The component \nplacements and connections shown work well, but other connection routings may also be effective.\nConnect the output filter capacitor(s) as shown between the VOUT trace and GND. It is important to keep the \nloop formed by the PH pin, Lout, Cout and GND as small as is practical.\nConnect the VOUT trace to the VSENSE pin using the resistor divider network to set the output voltage. Do not \nroute this trace too close to the PH trace. Due to the size of the IC package and the device pin-out, the trace \nmay need to be routed under the output capacitor. Alternately, the routing may be done on an alternate layer if a \ntrace under the output capacitor is not desired.\nIf using the grounding scheme shown in Figure 10-1 , use a via connection to a different layer to route to the ENA \npin.www.ti.comTPS5450\nSLVS757E – MARCH 2007 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5450\n10.2 Layout Example\nBOOT\nNC\nNC\nVSENSEPH\nVIN\nGND\nENAVout\nPHVin\nTOPSIDE GROUND AREAOUTPUT\nINDUCTOR\nOUTPUT\nFILTER\nCAPACITORBOOT\nCAPACITOR\nINPUT\nBYPASS\nCAPACITOR\nCATCH\nDIODE\nRoute INPUT VOLTAGE\ntrace under the catch diode\nand output capacitor\nor on another layer\nSignal VIARESISTOR\nDIVIDERFeedback Trace\nEXPOSED\nPOWERPAD\nAREA\nFigure 10-1.
