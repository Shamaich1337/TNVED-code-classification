#### Description:
The ST390-60T3MI is a SuperTan® wet tantalum capacitor manufactured by Vishay. It features a unique cathode system that allows for high capacitance per unit volume, making it suitable for applications where space is limited. The capacitor is designed to provide stability similar to solid tantalum capacitors while offering the advantages of lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) and higher ripple current ratings compared to conventional wet tantalum capacitors. The hermetically sealed construction ensures reliability in harsh environments.

#### Typical Applications:
The ST390-60T3MI is widely used in:
- **Defense and Aerospace**: Due to its robustness and reliability in extreme conditions.
- **Power Management**: In circuits requiring stable capacitance and low ESR.
- **Signal Processing**: Where high capacitance and low leakage are critical.
- **Space-Constrained Designs**: Ideal for applications where size and weight are critical factors.

This capacitor is particularly beneficial in applications that demand high performance under varying temperature conditions and where moisture resistance is essential.
