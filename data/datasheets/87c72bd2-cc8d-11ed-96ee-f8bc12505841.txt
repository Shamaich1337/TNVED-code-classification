If 0.254mm (10 mil) thick alumina thin fi  lm substrates must be used,  the die should be raised 0.150mm (6 mils) so that the surface of the die is coplanar with the surface of the substrate.  One way to accom-plish this is to attach the 0.102mm (4 mil) thick die to a 0.150mm (6 mil) thick molybdenum heat spreader (moly-tab) which is then attached to the ground plane (Figure 2).\nMicrostrip substrates should be mounted as close to the die as possible \nin order to minimize bond wire length.  Typical die-to-substrate spacing is 0.076mm to 0.152 mm (3 to 6 mils).\nHandling Precautions\nFollow these precautions to avoid permanent damage.\nStorage:  All bare die are placed in either Waffle or Gel based ESD protec-\ntive containers, and then sealed in an ESD protective bag for shipment. Once the sealed ESD protective bag has been opened, all die should be stored in a dry nitrogen environment.\nCleanliness:  Handle the chips in a clean environment. DO NOT attempt \nto clean the chip using liquid cleaning systems.Static Sensitivity:  Follow ESD precautions to protect against ESD \nstrikes.Transients:  Suppress instrument and bias supply transients while bias is \napplied. Use shielded signal and bias  cables to minimize inductive pick-\nup.\nGeneral Handling:  Handle the chip along the edges with a vacuum collet or with a sharp pair of bent tweezers. The \nsurface of the chip may have fragile air bridges and should not be touched with vacuum collet, tweezers, or fi  ngers.\nMounting\nThe chip is back-metallized and can be die mounted with AuSn eutectic preforms or with electrically conductive epoxy.  \nThe mounting surface should be clean and fl  at.Eutectic Die Attach:  A 80/20 gold tin preform is recommended with a work surface temperature of 255 °C and a tool \ntemperature of 265 °C.  When hot 90/10 nitrogen/hydrogen gas is applied, tool tip temperature should be 290 °C. DO NOT expose the chip to a temperature greater than 320 °C for more than 20 seconds.  No more than 3 seconds of scrubbing should be required for attachment.\nEpoxy Die Attach:  Apply a minimum amount of epoxy to the mounting surface so that a thin epoxy fi  llet is observed \naround the perimeter of the chip once it is placed into position.  Cure epoxy per the manufacturer’s schedule.\nWire Bonding\nBall or wedge bond with 0.025mm (1 mil) diameter pure gold wire.  Thermosonic wirebonding with a nominal stage temperature of 150 °C and a ball bonding force of 40 to 50 grams or wedge bonding force of 18 to 22 grams is recom-mended.  Use the minimum level of ultrasonic energy to achieve reliable wirebonds. Wirebonds should be started on the chip and terminated on the package or substrate.  All bonds should be as short as possible <0.31mm (12 mils).0.102mm (0.004”) Thick GaAs MMIC\nWire Bond\nRF Ground Plane\n0.127mm (0.005”) Thick Alumina\nThin Film Substrate0.076mm\n(0.003”)\nFigure 1.\n0.102mm (0.004”) Thick GaAs MMIC\nWire Bond\nRF Ground Plane\n0.254mm (0.010”) Thick Alumina\nThin Film Substrate0.076mm\n(0.003”)\nFigure 2.0.150mm (0.005”) Thick\nMoly Tab\nInformation furn ished by An alog Devices is believed to be a ccurate and reliable.
