D | Page 9  of 12 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe HMC788A  is designed with a Darlington feedback pair that \nexhibits reduced sensitivity to normal process variations and yields \nexcellent gain stability ov er temperature while requiring  minimal \nexternal bias components. The amplifier can be operated from a \n5 V supply by adding a choke inductor from the amplifier \noutput to V CC. \nBASIC CONNECTIONS  \nThe HMC788A  RF gain block is a fixed gain amplifier with single -\nended input and output ports featuring  impedances nominally \nequal to 50 Ω over the 0.01 GHz to 10 GHz frequency range . The \ninput and output impedances are sufficiently stable across variations in temperature  and supply voltage such that the \nHMC788A  can be directly inserted into a 50 Ω system with no \nimpedance matching circuitry required .  \nThe inp ut pin, RF\nIN, is dc-coupled and ac matched to 50 Ω.  A dc \nblocking capacitor  must  be connected between the source th at \ndrives the HMC788A  and the RF IN pin. \n It is critical to supply very low inductance ground connections to the GND pin  as well a s to the backside exposed pad, ensuring \nstable operation. It is recommended that the NIC pins also be connected to GND .  \nThe HMC788A  is designed to operate with a  supply  voltage of \n5 V , which is connected through an external RF choke between \nthe supply volta ge and the output pin, RF\nOUT. The inductance  of \nthe RF choke must  be approximately 6 µ H, and care must be \ntaken to ensure tha t the lowest series self  resonant frequency of \nthis choke is well above the maximum frequency of operation \nfor the HMC788A . Consequently, a dc blocking capacitor must  \nbe connected between the bias connection to RF OUT and the \noutput load. The value of this capacitor is not critical, but it is \nrecommended to be  100 pF or larger.  \nBypass the bias supply voltage, V CC, using a large value capacitance  \n(approximately 2.2 µF or larger) and a smaller, high frequency \nbypass capacitor (approximately 100  pF). \nThe recomm ended connections and components are shown in \nthe Evaluation PCB  section . \n \nHMC788A  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 10 of 12 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nEVALUATION PCB  \nThe PCB used in this application must  use RF circuit d esign \ntechniques. Signal lines must  have 50  Ω impedance while the \npackage ground leads and exposed pad must be connected \ndirectly to the ground plane similar to that shown  in Figure 19. \nA sufficient number of via holes must  be used to connect the top \nand bottom ground plan es. The EV1HMC788A LP2 evaluation  \nboard must be mount ed to an appropriate heat sink.   \nFigure 18 shows the schematic of the EV1HMC788ALP2 \nevaluation board. The board is powered by a single supply between  \n4.5 V and 5.5 V and is decoupled by a 2.2  µF capacitor and a \n100 pF  capacitor.
