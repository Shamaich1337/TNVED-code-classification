They combine an \nadvanced Greenliant  NAND controller and 4, 8, 16, 32,  \n64 or 128 GByte s of NAND flash in a multi -chip \npackage. These products are ideal for embedded and \nportable applications that require a smaller form factor \nand reliable data storage.  \nSATA- interface solid state mass storage technology is \nwidely used in industrial PCs, single board computers, \nservers, networking appliances, HMI and digital signage displays, test and measurement \ninstrumentation, multi -functional printers, robotics, and \nvideo equipment  and security  systems.  \nSATA NANDrive is a single device, solid state drive (SSD) that provides the functionality and compatibility \nof a complete SATA hard disk drive (HDD) in a 14 mm \nx 24 mm BGA package for easy, space saving \nmounting to a system motherboard. These products surpass traditional storage in their small size, security, \nreliability, ruggedness and low power consumption.  The integrated NAND flash controller with built -in \nadvanced NAND management firmware \ncommunicates with the host  through the standard \nSATA protocol. It does not require any additional or \nproprietary software such as the Flash File System \n(FFS) and Memory Technology Driver (MTD).  \nSATA NANDrive is pre -programmed with a 10- Byte \nunique serial ID and has the option of programming an additional 10- Byte serial ID for even greater \nsystem security.  \nSATA NANDrive’s advanced NAND management technology enhances data reliability and security, \nimproves endurance and accurately estimates the \nremaining life of  the NAND flash devices. This \ninnovative technology combines robust NAND \ncontroller hardware error correction capabilities with \nadvanced wear -leveling algorithms and bad block \nmanagement to significantly extend the life of the product.   \nSATA NANDrive devic es are offered in a 145- ball BGA, \n1 mm ball pitch package.  \nFactsheet 02.000  \nNovember 2020  \n These sp ecifications are subj ect to change without notice.   11/23/2020 \n © 2020 Greenliant  2 S71457- 01 GLS85LS 1xxxG / GLS85LS 1xxxQ  \nIndustrial Grade SATA NANDrive™  EX Series  \n1.0 GENERAL  DESCRIPTION  \nEach SATA NANDrive contains an integrated SATA NAND flash memory controller and up to eight discrete \nNAND flash die in a BGA package. Refer to Figure 2- 1 for the SATA NANDriv e block diagram.  \n \n1.1 Optimized SATA NANDrive  \nThe heart of SATA NANDrive is the SATA NAND flash memory controller which translates standard \nSATA signals into flash media data and control \nsignals. The following components contribute to \nSATA NANDrive’s operatio n. \n1.1.1  Microcontroller Unit (MCU) \nThe MCU translates SATA commands into data and \ncontrol signals required for flash media operation.  \n1.1.2  Internal Direct Memory Access (DMA)  \nSATA NANDrive uses internal DMA allowing instant \ndata transfer from/to buffer to/from flash media. This \nimplementation eliminates microcontroller overhead \nassociated with the traditional, firmware- based \napproach, thereby increasing the data transfer rate.  \n1.1.3  Power Management Unit (PMU)  \nThe PMU controls the power consumption of SATA \nNANDrive. The PM U dramatically reduces the power \nconsumption of SATA NANDrive by putting the part \nof the circuitry that is not in operation into sleep \nmode.  \nThe Flash File System handles inadvertent power \ninterrupts and has auto- recovery capability to ensure \nSATA NANDriv e firmware integrity. For regular \npower management, the host must send a \nSTANDBY_IMMEDIATE (E0h), IDLE_IMMEDIATE \n(E1h), STANDBY (E2h) or IDLE (E3h) command \nand wait for  the command- ready before powering \ndown SATA NANDrive.  \n1.1.4  Embedded Flash File System  \nThe em bedded flash file system is an integral part of \nSATA NANDrive. It contains MCU firmware that \nperforms the following tasks:  \n1. Translates host side signals into flash media \nwrites and reads  \n2. Provides flash media wear leveling to spread \nthe flash writes across all memory address \nspace to increase the longevity of flash media  \n3. Keeps track of data file structures  \n4. Manages system security for the selected \nprotection zones  \n1.1.5  Error Correction Code (ECC) \nThe ECC technology uses advanced algorithms to  \ndetect and correct err ors, ensuring data integrity and \nextending the SSD lifespan.  1.1.6  Serial Communication Interface (SCI)  \nThe Serial Communication Interface (SCI) is \ndesigned for error reporting. During the product \ndevelopment stage, it is recommended to provide the SCI port on t he PCB to aid in design validation.  \n1.1.7  Multi -tasking Interface  \nThe multi -tasking interface enables fast, sequential  \nwrite performance by allowing concurrent Read, \nProgram and Erase operations to multiple flash \nmedia.  \n1.2 EnduroSLC™ Technology  \nEnduroSLC™ is a proprietary 3D NAND \nmanagement technology developed by Greenliant \nfor high reliability applications requiring ultra- high \nendurance and superior data retention. Using 1- bit-\nper-cell (SLC) NAND configuration, EnduroSLC \nenabled SSDs are ideal for write- intensive \napplications used in extreme temperature, high stress environments. EnduroSLC enabled solid state \ndrives offer a high reliability flash storage solution \nwith ultra -high write endurance that exceeds \ncapabilities of legacy, planar SLC NAND based products.  \n1.3 SMT Reflow Consideration \nPreprogrammed NAND devices have temperature limits due t o data retention. The EnduroSLC  SATA \nNANDrive family can withstand multiple passes of \nSMT high temperat ure process without losing data. \nUsing Greenliant’s recommended reflow pr ofile \nduring production will help prevent damage to the \ndevice and ensure better retention of any \npreprogrammed data through the surface- mount \nsoldering process. See the relevant datasheet \nsection describing the recommended reflow \ntemperature limits.  \n1.4 Advan ced NAND Management  \nSATA NANDrive’s integrated controller uses advanced wear -leveling algorithms to substantially \nincrease the longevity of NAND flash media. Wear caused by data writes is evenly distributed across  all \nor select blocks in the device to prevent “hot spots” \nin locations that are programmed and erased \nextensively. This effective wear -leveling technique \nresults in optimized device endurance, enhanced \ndata retention and higher reliability required by long-\nlife applications . \nFactsheet 02.000  \nNovember 2020  \n These sp ecifications are subj ect to change without notice.   11/23/2020 \n © 2020 Greenliant  3 S71457- 01 GLS85LS 1xxxG / GLS85LS 1xxxQ  \nIndustrial Grade SATA NANDrive™  EX Series  \n2.0 FUNCTIONAL BLOCKS  \n \nFigure  2-1: SATA NANDriv e Block Diagram  \n \nFactsheet 02.000  \nNovember 2020  \n These sp ecifications are subj ect to change without notice.   11/23/2020 \n © 2020 Greenliant  4 S71457- 01 GLS85LS 1xxxG / GLS85LS 1xxxQ  \nIndustrial Grade SATA NANDrive™  EX Series  \n \n3.0 Product Ordering Information \n \n \nGLS  85   LS   1    xxxQ  -  S   -   I   -   LxJE  -   NDxxx  \nXX  XX   X   XXXX  -   X   -   X  -  XXXX  -  XXXXX  \n Ordering  Code 1)  \n NDxxx = NANDrive Revision  \n EDxxx = Evaluation Board Revision  \n  Environmental  Attribute  \n E = non -Pb solder (RoHS Compliant ) \n  Package Modifier  \n BJ = 145- ball positions  \n  Package Type  \n  LB = LFBGA  \n  LF = LBGA  \n  Operati ng Temperature  \n  I = Industrial: - 40°C to +85°C  \n NAND Configuration  \n  S = 1 bit per cell  \n  Product Generation  \n  G, Q = Generation  \n Capacity \n  004 = 4 GByte  \n  008 = 8 GByte  \n  016 = 16 GByte  \n  032 = 32 GByte  \n  064 = 64 GByte  \n  128 = 128 GByte  \n MByte or GByte Designator  \n  0 = MByte  \n  1 = GByte  \n  Interface  \n  S = SATA \n  Voltage  \n  L = 3.3V  \n  Product Family \n  85 = NANDrive  \n \n \n \n \n1) Note that the top side marking on the package typically does not include ordering codes (e.g. NDxxx), unless it is a special C -SPEC \n(custom specification) which is required by the end- customer to be marked on the device . \n \n \nFactsheet 02.000  \nNovember 2020  \n These sp ecifications are subj ect to change without notice.   11/23/2020 \n © 2020 Greenliant  5 S71457- 01 GLS85LS 1xxxG / GLS85LS 1xxxQ  \nIndustrial Grade SATA NANDrive™  EX Series  \nValid Combina tions  \nValid product combinations are those that are in the mass production,  or will be in the mass production.
