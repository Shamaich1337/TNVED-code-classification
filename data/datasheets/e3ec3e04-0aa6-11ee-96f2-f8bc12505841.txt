Relative to any attached 1-Wire \nslave device, the DS2484 is a 1-Wire master. Internal, \nuser-adjustable timers relieve the system host processor \nfrom generating time-critical 1-Wire waveforms, support -\ning both standard and overdrive 1-Wire communication \nspeeds. In addition, the 1-Wire bus can be powered \ndown under software control. The dual-voltage operation \nallows different operating voltages on the I 2C and 1-Wire \nside. Strong pullup features support 1-Wire power deliv -\nery to 1-Wire devices such as EEPROMs and sensors. \nWhen not in use, the DS2484 can be put in sleep mode \nwhere power consumption is minimal.\nApplications\nPrinters\nMedical Instruments\nIndustrial Sensors\nCell PhonesBenefits and Features\nS I2C Host Interface Supports 100kHz and 400kHz \nI2C Communication Speeds\nS Standard and Overdrive 1-Wire Communication \nSpeeds\nS Adjustable 1-Wire Timing for t RSTL , tMSP, tW0L, \nand t REC0\nS 1-Wire Port Can Be Powered Down Under \nSoftware Control\nS Supports Power-Saving Sleep Mode (SLPZ Pin), \nWhere the 1-Wire Port is in High Impedance\nS I2C Operating Voltages: 1.8V ±5%, 3.3V ±10%, and \n5.0V +5/-10%\nS Built-In Level Translator: 1-Wire Operating Voltage \nfrom 1.8V -5% to 5.0V +5%, Independent of I 2C \nVoltage\nS Built-In ESD Protection Level of ±8kV Human \nBody Model (HBM) Contact Discharge on IO Pin\nS -40NC to +85 NC Operating Temperature Range \nS 8-Pin TDFN and 6-Pin SOT23 Packages\nTypical Application Circuit\n19-6701; Rev 1; 7/15Ordering Information  appears at end of data sheet.\n1-Wire is a registered trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.*RP = I2C PULLUP RESISTOR (SEE THE Pullup Resistor R P Sizing  SECTION FOR R P SIZING)SDAVCC\nSCL\nSLPZ IORP*3V\n5V\n1-Wire BUSµC(I2C PORT)\n1-Wire\nDEVICE #11-Wire\nDEVICE #21-Wire\nDEVICE #nDS2484\nFor pricing, delivery, and ordering information, please contact Maxim Direct at \n1-888-629-4642, or visit Maxim Integrated’s website at www.maximintegrated.com.\n  2\nMaxim IntegratedDS2484\nSingle-Channel 1-Wire Master  \nwith Adjustable Timing and Sleep ModeVoltage Range on Any Pin Relative to Ground  .......-0.5V to +6V\nMaximum Current into Any Pin  ........................................... 20mA\nContinuous Power Dissipation (T A = +70NC) \nSOT23 (derate 8.7mW/ NC above +70 NC) ................. 695.7mW  \nTDFN (derate 16.7mW/ NC above +70 NC) ............... 1333.3mWOperating Temperature Range  .......................... -40NC to +85 NC\nJunction Temperature  ..................................................... +150NC\nStorage Temperature Range  ............................ -55NC to +125 NC\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s)  ................................ +300NC\nSoldering Temperature (reflow)  ...................................... +260NCABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nStresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device.

Block Diagram\nTable 1. Device Configuration Register Bit Assignment\nDetailed Description\nThe DS2484 is a self-timed 1-Wire master that supports \nadvanced 1-Wire waveform features including standard \nand overdrive speeds, active pullup, and strong pullup \nfor power delivery. The active pullup affects rising edges \non the 1-Wire side. The strong pullup function uses the \nsame pullup transistor as the active pullup, but with a \ndifferent control algorithm. Once supplied with command \nand data, the input/output controller of the DS2484 per -\nforms time-critical 1-Wire communication functions such \nas reset/presence-detect cycle, read-byte, write-byte, \nsingle bit R/W, and triplet for ROM Search, without requir -\ning interaction with the host processor. The host obtains \nfeedback (completion of a 1-Wire function, presence \npulse, 1-Wire short, search direction taken) through the \nStatus register and data through the Read Data regis -\nter. The DS2484 communicates with a host processor \nthrough its I 2C bus interface in standard mode or in fast \nmode. See Figure 1  for a block diagram.\nDevice Registers\nThe DS2484 has four registers that the I 2C host can \nread: Device Configuration, Status, Read Data, and Port \nConfiguration. These registers are addressed by a read pointer. The position of the read pointer, i.e., the reg -\nister that the host reads in a subsequent read access, \nis defined by the instruction the DS2484 executed last. \nTo enable certain 1-Wire features, the host has read- \nand write-access to the Device Configuration and Port \nConfiguration registers.\nDevice Configuration Register\nThe DS2484 supports four 1-Wire features that are \nenabled or selected through the Device Configuration \nregister ( Table 1 ). These features are as follows:\n• Active Pullup (APU)\n• 1-Wire Power-Down (PDN)\n• Strong Pullup (SPU)\n• 1-Wire Speed (1WS)\nAPU, SPU, and 1WS can be selected in any combination. \nWhile APU and 1WS maintain their states, SPU returns to \nits inactive state as soon as the strong pullup has ended.\nAfter a device reset (power-up cycle or initiated by the \nDevice Reset  command), the Device Configuration reg -\nister reads 00h. When writing to the Device Configuration \nregister, the new data is accepted only if the upper nibble \n(bits 7 to 4) is the one’s complement of the lower nibble \n(bits 3 to 0). When read, the upper nibble is always 0h.BIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\n1WS SPU PDN APU 1WS SPU PDN APUCONFIGURATION AND\nTIMING REGISTER\nI2C\nINTERFACE\nCONTROLLERINPUT/OUTPUT\nCONTROLLERLINE\nXCVRT-TIME OSC\nSTATUS\nREGISTER\nREAD DATA\nREGISTERSDAIO\nSLPZ\nGNDSCLVCC\nDS2484\n  7\nMaxim IntegratedDS2484\nSingle-Channel 1-Wire Master  \nwith Adjustable Timing and Sleep ModeTable 2. Effects of PDN and SLPZ\nFigure 2. Rising Edge Pullup as Seen at the End of a Write-Zero Time SlotActive Pullup (APU)\nThe APU bit controls whether an active pullup (low \nimpedance transistor) or a passive pullup (R WPU resis -\ntor) is used to drive a 1-Wire line from low to high. When \nAPU = 0, active pullup is disabled (resistor mode). \nEnabling active pullup is generally recommended for \nbest 1-Wire bus performance. The active pullup does \nnot apply to the rising edge of a recovery after a short \non the 1-Wire line. If enabled, a fixed-duration active \npullup (typically 2.5 Fs standard speed, 0.5 Fs overdrive \nspeed) also applies in a reset/presence detect cycle on \nthe rising edges after t RSTL  and after t PDL.\nThe circuit that controls rising edges operates as follows \n(Figure 2 ): At t 1, the pulldown (from DS2484 or 1-Wire \nslave) ends. From this point on the 1-Wire bus is pulled \nhigh through R WPU internal to the DS2484. V CC and the \ncapacitive load of the 1-Wire line determine the slope. In \ncase that active pullup is disabled (APU = 0), the resis -\ntive pullup continues, as represented by the solid line. \nWith active pullup enabled (APU = 1), and when at t 2 the \nvoltage has reached the V IAPO  threshold, the DS2484 activates a low-impedance pullup transistor, as repre -\nsented by the dashed line. The active pullup remains \nactive until the end of the time slot (t 3), after which the \nresistive pullup continues. The shortest duration of the \nactive pullup is t REC0  - (t2 - t1) in a write-zero time slot \nand the longest duration is t W0L + tREC0  - tW1L - (t2 - t1) \nin a write-one time slot. In a read-data time slot, the active \npullup duration is slave dependent. See the Strong Pullup \n(SPU)  section for a way to keep the pullup transistor con -\nducting beyond t 3.\n1-Wire Power Down (PDN)\nThe PDN bit is used to remove power from the 1-Wire \nport, e.g., to force a 1-Wire slave to perform a power-on \nreset. PDN can as well be used in conjunction with the \nsleep mode (see Table 2  for details). While PDN is 1, \nno 1-Wire communication is possible. To end the 1-Wire \npower-down state, the PDN bit must be changed to 0.\nWriting both the PDN bit and the SPU bit to 1 forces the \nSPU bit to 0. With the DS2483, both bits can be written \nto 1, which can be used to logically distinguish between \nboth parts.\nPDN = SLPZ IS LOGIC 0 SLPZ IS LOGIC 1\n0• RWPU is connected.\n• IO is at V CC, keeping the slaves powered.\n• The DS2484 is powered down (sleep mode). • RWPU is connected.\n• IO is at V CC, keeping the slaves powered.\n• The DS2484 is powered up (normal operation).\n1• RWPU is disconnected.\n• IO is at 0V, causing the slaves to lose power.\n• The DS2484 is powered down (sleep mode).• RWPU is disconnected.\n• IO is at 0V, causing the slaves to lose power.\n• The DS2484 is powered up.\nAPU = 0 NEXT TIME SLOTAPU = 1VCC\n0V\n1-Wire BUS IS\nDISCHARGEDt1 t2 t3VIAPO\nVIL1MAX\ntREC0\n  8\nMaxim IntegratedDS2484\nSingle-Channel 1-Wire Master  \nwith Adjustable Timing and Sleep ModeFigure 3. Low-Impedance Pullup TimingStrong Pullup (SPU)\nThe SPU bit is used to activate the strong pullup func -\ntion prior to a 1-Wire Write Byte  or 1-Wire Single Bit  \ncommand. Strong pullup is commonly used with 1-Wire \nEEPROM devices when copying scratchpad data to the \nmain memory or when performing a SHA computation \nand with parasitically powered temperature sensors or \nA/D converters. The respective Maxim 1-Wire IC data \nsheets specify the location in the communications proto -\ncol after which the strong pullup should be applied. The \nSPU bit must be set immediately prior to issuing the com -\nmand that puts the 1-Wire device into the state where it \nneeds the extra power. The strong pullup uses the same \ninternal pullup transistor as the active pullup feature. \nSee the R APU parameter in the Electrical Characteristics  \nto determine whether the voltage drop is low enough to \nmaintain the required 1-Wire voltage at a given load cur -\nrent and 1-Wire supply voltage.\nIf SPU is 1 and APU is 0, the DS2484 treats the rising \nedge of the time slot as if the active pullup was activat -\ned, but uses V IH1 as the threshold to enable the strong \npullup. If SPU is 1 and APU is 1, the threshold voltage \nto enable the strong pullup is V IAPO . Once enabled, in \ncontrast to the active pullup, the internal pullup transis -\ntor remains conducting, as shown in Figure 3 , until one \nof three events occurs: the DS2484 receives a com -\nmand that generates 1-Wire communication (the typical case), the SPU bit in the Device Configuration register \nis written to 0, or the DS2484 receives the Device Reset  \ncommand. When the strong pullup ends, the SPU bit is \nautomatically reset to 0. Using the strong pullup feature \ndoes not change the state of the APU bit in the Device \nConfiguration register.\n1-Wire Speed (1WS)\nThe 1WS bit determines the timing of any 1-Wire com -\nmunication generated by the DS2484. All 1-Wire slave \ndevices support standard speed (1WS = 0). Many \n1-Wire devices can also communicate at a higher data \nrate, called overdrive speed. To change from standard \nto overdrive speed, a 1-Wire device needs to receive \nan Overdrive-Skip ROM or Overdrive-Match ROM com -\nmand, as explained in the Maxim 1-Wire IC data sheets. \nThe change in speed occurs immediately after the 1-Wire \ndevice has received the speed-changing command \ncode. The DS2484 must take part in this speed change \nto stay synchronized. This is accomplished by writing to \nthe Device Configuration register with the 1WS bit as 1 \nimmediately after the 1-Wire Byte command that changes \nthe speed of a 1-Wire device. Writing to the Device \nConfiguration register with the 1WS bit as 0, followed by \na 1-Wire Reset  command, changes the DS2484 and any \n1-Wire devices on the active 1-Wire line back to standard \nspeed.\nDS2484 RESISTIVE PULLUP DS2484 PULLDOWN DS2484 STRONG PULLUPVCC\nSEE TEXT\n0VWRITE-ZERO CASEWRITE-ONE CASE\ntSLOTLAST BIT OF 1-Wire WRITE BYTE OR 1-Wire SINGLE BIT FUNCTION\nNEXT\nTIME SLOT\nOR 1-Wire\nRESET\n  9\nMaxim IntegratedDS2484\nSingle-Channel 1-Wire Master  \nwith Adjustable Timing and Sleep ModeTable 3. Status Register Bit Assignment\nStatus Register\nThe read-only Status register is the general means for \nthe DS2484 to report bit-type data from the 1-Wire side, \n1-Wire busy status, and its own reset status to the host \nprocessor ( Table 3 ). All 1-Wire communication com -\nmands and the Device Reset  command position the read \npointer at the Status register for the host processor to \nread with minimal protocol overhead. Status information \nis updated during the execution of certain commands \nonly. Bit details are given in the following descriptions.\n1-Wire Busy (1WB)\nThe 1WB bit reports to the host processor whether the \n1-Wire line is busy. During 1-Wire communication 1WB \nis 1; once the command is completed, 1WB returns to \nits default 0. Details on when 1WB changes state and \nfor how long it remains at 1 are found in the Function \nCommands  section.\nPresence-Pulse Detect (PPD)\nThe PPD bit is updated with every 1-Wire Reset  com -\nmand. If the DS2484 detects a logic 0 on the 1-Wire line \nat tMSP during the presence-detect cycle, the PPD bit is \nset to 1. This bit returns to its default 0 if there is no pres -\nence pulse during a subsequent 1-Wire Reset  command.\nShort Detected (SD)\nThe SD bit is updated with every 1-Wire Reset  com -\nmand. If the DS2484 detects a logic 0 on the 1-Wire line \nat tSI during the presence-detect cycle, the SD bit is set \nto 1. This bit returns to its default 0 with a subsequent \n1-Wire Reset  command, provided that the short has been \nremoved. If the 1-Wire line is shorted at t MSP, the PPD \nbit is also set. The DS2484 cannot distinguish between a \nshort and a DS1994 or DS2404 signaling a 1-Wire inter -\nrupt. For this reason, if a DS2404 or DS1994 is used in \nthe application, the interrupt function must be disabled. \nThe interrupt signaling is explained in the respective \nMaxim 1-Wire IC data sheets.Logic Level (LL)\nThe LL bit reports the logic state of the active 1-Wire line \nwithout initiating any 1-Wire communication. The 1-Wire \nline is sampled for this purpose every time the Status \nregister is read. The sampling and updating of the LL bit \ntakes place when the host processor has addressed the \nDS2484 in read mode (during the acknowledge cycle), \nprovided that the read pointer is positioned at the Status \nregister.\nDevice Reset (RST)\nIf the RST bit is 1, the DS2484 has performed an internal \nreset cycle, either caused by a power-on reset or from \nexecuting the Device Reset  command. The RST bit is \ncleared automatically when the DS2484 executes a Write \nDevice Configuration  command to restore the selection \nof the desired 1-Wire features.\nSingle Bit Result (SBR)\nThe SBR bit reports the logic state of the active 1-Wire \nline sampled at t MSR of a 1-Wire Single Bit  command or \nthe first bit of a 1-Wire Triplet  command. The power-on \ndefault of SBR is 0. If the 1-Wire Single Bit  command \nsends a 0 bit, SBR should be 0. With a 1-Wire Triplet  \ncommand, SBR could be 0 as well as 1, depending on \nthe response of the 1-Wire devices connected. The same \nresult applies to a 1-Wire Single Bit  command that sends \na 1 bit.\nTriplet Second Bit (TSB)\nThe TSB bit reports the logic state of the active 1-Wire \nline sampled at t MSR of the second bit of a 1-Wire Triplet  \ncommand. The power-on default of TSB is 0. This bit is \nupdated only with a 1-Wire Triplet  command and has no \nfunction with other commands.\nBranch Direction Taken (DIR)\nWhenever a 1-Wire Triplet  command is executed, this bit \nreports to the host processor the search direction that \nwas chosen by the third bit of the triplet.

Port Configuration Register Bit Assignment\nPort Configuration Register\nThe Port Configuration register allows verifying the set -\ntings for the 1-Wire port ( Table 4 ). The Adjust 1-Wire \nPort command positions the read pointer to the Port \nConfiguration register for the host processor to read \nwith minimal protocol overhead. When reading the Port \nConfiguration register, the parameter values are reported \nin this sequence:\n Parameter 000 (t RSTL) standard speed, overdrive speed\n Parameter 001 (t MSP) standard speed, overdrive speed\n Parameter 010 (t W0L) standard speed, overdrive speed\n Parameter 011 (t REC0 )\n Parameter 100 (R WPU)\nIf one continues reading, the parameter number rolls \nover to 000 and one receives the same data again.\nNote that the upper 4 bits read from the port configura -\ntion register are always 0. See Table 7 for the conversion \nbetween parameter value code and actual parameter \nvalue.Function Commands\nThe DS2484 understands nine function commands that \nfall into four categories: device control, I 2C communi -\ncation, 1-Wire setup, and 1-Wire communication. The \nfeedback path to the host is controlled by a read pointer, \nwhich is set automatically by each function command \nfor the host to efficiently access relevant information. \nThe host processor sends these commands and appli -\ncable parameters as strings of 1 or 2 bytes using the \nI2C interface. The I 2C protocol requires that each byte \nbe acknowledged by the receiving party to confirm \nacceptance or not be acknowledged to indicate an error \ncondition (invalid code or parameter) or to end the com -\nmunication. See the I2C Interface  section for details of \nthe I 2C protocol including acknowledge.\nThe function commands are as follows:\n1) Device Reset\n2) Set Read Pointer\n3) Write Device Configuration\n4) Adjust 1-Wire Port\n5) 1-Wire Reset\n6) 1-Wire Single Bit\n7) 1-Wire Write Byte\n8) 1-Wire Read Byte\n9) 1-Wire TripletBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\n0 0 0 0 VAL3 VAL2 VAL1 VAL0\nBITS 3:0VAL[3:0] : Parameter Value Code\nSee Table 7 for the conversion between binary code and parameter value.\n  11\nMaxim IntegratedDS2484\nSingle-Channel 1-Wire Master  \nwith Adjustable Timing and Sleep ModeTable 5.

I 2C Protocol Overview\nFigure 8. DS2484 Slave Address\nI2C Interface\nGeneral Characteristics\nThe I 2C bus uses a data line (SDA) and a clock signal \n(SCL) for communication. Both SDA and SCL are bidi -\nrectional lines connected to a positive supply voltage \nthrough a pullup resistor. When there is no communica -\ntion, both lines are high. The output stages of devices \nconnected to the bus must have an open drain or open \ncollector to perform the wired-AND function. Data on the \nI2C bus can be transferred at rates of up to 100kbps in \nstandard mode and up to 400kbps in fast mode. The \nDS2484 works in both modes.A device that sends data on the bus is defined as a \ntransmitter, and a device receiving data is defined as a \nreceiver. The device that controls the communication is \ncalled a master. The devices that are controlled by the \nmaster are slaves. To be individually accessed, each \ndevice must have a slave address that does not conflict \nwith other devices on the bus.\nData transfers can be initiated only when the bus is not \nbusy. The master generates the serial clock (SCL), con -\ntrols the bus access, generates the START and STOP \nconditions, and determines the number of data bytes \ntransferred between START and STOP ( Figure 7 ). Data \nis transferred in bytes with the most significant bit being \ntransmitted first. After each byte follows an acknowledge \nbit to allow synchronization between master and slave.\nSlave Address\nFigure 8  shows the slave address to which the DS2484 \nresponds. The slave address is part of the slave address/\ncontrol byte. The last bit of the slave address/control \nbyte (R/ W) defines the data direction. When set to 0, \nsubsequent data flows from master to slave (write access \nmode); when set to 1, data flows from slave to master \n(read access mode).SDA\nSCL\nIDLE1–7 89 1–7 89 1–78 9\nSTART\nCONDITION STOP CONDITION \nREPEATED STARTSLAVE\nADDRESSR/W ACK ACK DATA ACK/\nNACKDATAMSB FIRST MSB LSB MSB LSB\nREPEATED IF MORE BYTES\nARE TRANSFERRED\n0A6\nMSB0A5\n1A4\n1A37-BIT SLAVE ADDRESS\n0A2\n0A1\n0A0\nR/W\nDETERMINES\nREAD OR WRITE\n  20\nMaxim IntegratedDS2484\nSingle-Channel 1-Wire Master  \nwith Adjustable Timing and Sleep ModeFigure 9. I 2C Timing DiagramI2C Definitions\nThe following terminology is commonly used to describe \nI2C data transfers. See Figure 9  for a timing diagram.\nBus Idle or Not Busy: Both SDA and SCL are inac -\ntive and in their logic-high states.\nSTART Condition: To initiate communication with a \nslave, the master must generate a START condition. \nA START condition is defined as a change in state of \nSDA from high to low while SCL remains high.\nSTOP Condition: To end communication with a \nslave, the master must generate a STOP condition. A \nSTOP condition is defined as a change in state of SDA \nfrom low to high while SCL remains high.\nRepeated START Condition: Repeated STARTs are \ncommonly used for read accesses to select a specific \ndata source or address from which to read. The mas -\nter can use a repeated START condition at the end \nof a data transfer to immediately initiate a new data \ntransfer following the current one. A repeated START \ncondition is generated the same way as a normal \nSTART condition, but without leaving the bus idle after \na STOP condition.\nData Valid: With the exception of the START and \nSTOP condition, transitions of SDA can occur only \nduring the low state of SCL. The data on SDA must remain valid and unchanged during the entire high \npulse of SCL plus the required setup and hold time \n(tHD:DAT  after the falling edge of SCL and t SU:DAT  \nbefore the rising edge of SCL; see Figure 9 ). There is \none clock pulse per bit of data. Data is shifted into the \nreceiving device during the rising edge of SCL pulse.\nWhen finished with writing, the master must release \nthe SDA line for a sufficient amount of setup time \n(minimum t SU:DAT  + tR in Figure 9 ) before the next ris -\ning edge of SCL to start reading. The slave shifts out \neach data bit on SDA at the falling edge of the previ -\nous SCL pulse and the data bit is valid at the rising \nedge of the current SCL pulse. The master generates \nall SCL clock pulses, including those needed to read \nfrom a slave.\nAcknowledge: Typically a receiving device, when \naddressed, is obliged to generate an acknowledge \nafter the receipt of each byte. The master must \ngenerate a clock pulse that is associated with this \nacknowledge bit. A device that acknowledges must \npull SDA low during the acknowledge clock pulse \nin such a way that SDA is stable low during the high \nperiod of the acknowledge-related clock pulse plus \nthe required setup and hold time (t HD:DAT  after the \nfalling edge of SCL and t SU:DAT  before the rising \nedge of SCL).\nSCL\nNOTE: TIMING IS REFERENCED TO V IL(MAX)  AND V IH(MIN) .SDA\nSTOP START REPEATED\nSTARTSPIKE\nSUPPRESSIONtBUF\ntHD:STA\ntHD:DAT tSU:DATtSU:STOtHD:STAtSP\ntSU:STAtHIGH\ntRtF\ntLOW\n  21\nMaxim IntegratedDS2484\nSingle-Channel 1-Wire Master  \nwith Adjustable Timing and Sleep ModeTable 10. I 2C Communication—Legend\nTable 11. Data Direction CodesNot Acknowledged by Slave: A slave device could \nbe unable to receive or transmit data, e.g., because \nit is busy performing a real-time function or is in \nsleep mode. In this case, the slave device does not \nacknowledge its slave address and leaves the SDA \nline high. A slave device that is ready to communicate \nacknowledges at least its slave address. However, \nsome time later the slave can refuse to accept data, \ne.g., because of an invalid command or parameter. \nIn this case, the slave device does not acknowledge \nany of the bytes that it refuses and leaves SDA high. \nIn either case, after a slave has failed to acknowledge, \nthe master first should generate a repeated START \ncondition or a STOP condition followed by a START \ncondition to begin a new data transfer.\nNot Acknowledged by Master: At some time when \nreceiving data, the master must signal an end of data \nto the slave device. To achieve this, the master does \nnot acknowledge the last byte that it has received \nfrom the slave. In response, the slave releases SDA, \nallowing the master to generate the STOP condition.\nWriting to the DS2484\nTo write to the DS2484, the master must access the \ndevice in write mode, i.e., the slave address must be sent \nwith the direction bit set to 0. The next byte to be sent is \na command code, which, depending on the command, \nmay be followed by a command parameter. The DS2484 \nacknowledges valid command codes and expected/\nvalid command parameters. Additional bytes or invalid \ncommand parameters are never acknowledged.\nReading from the DS2484\nTo read from the DS2484, the master must access the \ndevice in read mode, i.e., the slave address must be sent \nwith the direction bit set to 1. The read pointer determines \nthe register that the master reads from. The master can \ncontinue reading the same register over and over again, \nwithout having to readdress the device, e.g., to watch \nthe 1WB changing from 1 to 0.

I 2C Fast Mode Pullup Resistor Selection ChartApplications Information\nSDA and SCL Pullup Resistors\nSDA is an open-drain output on the DS2484 that requires \na pullup resistor to realize high-logic levels. Because the \nDS2484 uses SCL only as input (no clock stretching), the \nmaster can drive SCL either through an open-drain/col -\nlector output with a pullup resistor or a push-pull output.\nPullup Resistor R P Sizing\nAccording to the I 2C specification, a slave device must \nbe able to sink at least 3mA at a V OL of 0.4V. This DC \ncondition determines the minimum value of the pullup \nresistor: RP(MIN)  = (V CI2C - 0.4V)/3mA . With an I 2C pul -\nlup voltage V CI2C of 5.5V, the minimum value for the pul -\nlup resistor is 1.7k I. The “Minimum R P” line in Figure 10  \nshows how the minimum pullup resistor changes with the \noperating (pullup) voltage.\nFor I 2C systems, the rise time and fall time are measured \nfrom 30% to 70% of the pullup voltage. The maximum \nbus capacitance, C B, is 400pF. The maximum rise time must not exceed 300ns. Assuming maximum rise time, \nthe maximum resistor value at any given capacitance C B \nis calculated as: RP(MAX)  = 300ns/(C B x ln(7/3)) . For a \nbus capacitance of 400pF, the maximum pullup resistor \nwould be 885 I.\nBecause an 885 I pullup resistor, as would be required \nto meet the rise time specification at 400pF bus capaci -\ntance, is lower than R P(MIN)  at 5.5V, a different approach \nis necessary. The “Maximum Load at Minimum R P Fast \nMode” line in Figure 10  is generated by first calculating \nthe minimum pullup resistor at any given operating volt -\nage (“Minimum R P” line) and then calculating the respec -\ntive bus capacitance that yields a 300ns rise time.\nOnly for pullup voltages of 3V and lower can the maxi-\nmum permissible 400pF bus capacitance be maintained. \nA reduced 300pF bus capacitance is acceptable for 4V \nand lower pullup voltages. For fast mode operation at \nany pullup voltage, the bus capacitance must not exceed \n200pF. The corresponding pullup resistor value at the \nvoltage is indicated by the “Minimum R P” line.\nMINIMUM R P\nMAXIMUM LOAD AT MINIMUM R P FAST MODE2000MINIMUM R P (Ω)\nLOAD (pF)\nPULLUP VOLTAGE (V)1600\n1200\n800\n400\n12 34 50500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n  28\nMaxim IntegratedDS2484\nSingle-Channel 1-Wire Master  \nwith Adjustable Timing and Sleep ModeOrdering Information Package Information\nFor the latest package outline information and land patterns (foot -\nprints), go to www.maximintegrated.com/packages .
