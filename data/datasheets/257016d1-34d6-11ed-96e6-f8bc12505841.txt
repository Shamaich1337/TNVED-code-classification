The gain of each amplifier can be programmed separately or simultaneously over a range of 4.5 dB to 20.25 dB in steps of 0.25 dB. The amplifier offers flat frequency performance from dc \nto 70 MHz, independent of gain code. \nThe AD8366 offers excellent spurious-free dynamic range, suitable \nfor driving high resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The NF at maximum gain is 11.4 dB at 10 MHz and increases \n~2 dB for every 4 dB decrease in gain. Over the entire gain range, \nthe HD3/HD2 are better than −90 dBc for 2 V p-p at the output at 10 MHz into 200 Ω. The two-tone intermodulation distortion of −90 dBc into 200 Ω translates to an OIP3 of 45 dBm (38 dBV rms). The differential input impedance of 200 Ω provides a well-defined termination. The differential output has a low impedance of ~25 Ω.  The output common-mode voltage defaults to V\nPOS/2 but can  \nbe programmed via the VCMA and VCMB pins over a range  of voltages. The input common-mode voltage also defaults  to V\nPOS/2 but can be driven down to 1.5 V . A built-in, dc offset \ncompensation loop can be used to eliminate dc offsets from prior stages in the signal chain. This loop can also be disabled if dc-\ncoupled operation is desired.  \nThe digital interface allows for parallel or serial mode gain \nprogramming. The AD8366 operates from a 4.75 V to 5.25 V \nsupply and consumes typically 180 mA. When disabled, the  \npart consumes roughly 3 mA. The AD8366 is fabricated using Analog Devices, Inc., advanced silicon-germanium bipolar process, and it is available in a 32-lead exposed paddle LFCSP package. Performance is specified over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range. \n \nAD8366 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

B | Page 15 of 28 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8366 is a dual , differential , digitally controlled VGA \nwith 600 MHz of 3  dB bandwidth and a gain range of 4.5 dB to \n20.25 dB adjustable in 0.25  dB steps.  Using a proprietary variable \ngain architecture, the AD8366 is able to achieve excel lent linearity \n(45 dBm) and noise performance (11.7 nV/ √Hz) at 10  MHz at \nminimum  gain. Intended for use in direct conversion systems,  the \npart also includes dc  offset correction  that can be disabled easily \nby grounding either OFSA  or OFSB.  In addition, the part off ers \nan adjustable output common -mode range  of 1.6 V to 3 V. \nThe main signal path is shown in Figure 46. It consists of an \ninput transconductance, a variable -gain cell, and an output \ntransimpedance amplifier.  \n100Ω\n100Ω12.5Ω12.5ΩVARIABLE\nCURREN T-GAIN\nSTAGEOUTPUT\nBUFFER\nZ A\nI\nVIRTUA L\nGROUNDVIRTUA L\nGROUNDINP\nINMOUT P\nOUTM\n07584-071\nF\nigure 46. Main Signal Path   \nThe input transconductance provides a broadband 200  Ω \ndifferential termination and converts the input voltage to a \ncurrent.  This current is fed into the variable current -gain cell. \nThe output of this cell goes into the transimpedance stage, which  \ngenerates the output voltage. The transimpedance is fixed at 500  Ω, \nwith a roughly 25  Ω differential output impedance.  \nINPUTS  \nThe inputs to the digitally -controlled VGAs  in the AD8366 are \ndifferential and can be either ac - or dc -coupled . The AD8366 \nsynthesizes a 200  Ω (differential) input impedance, with a return \nloss (re: 200  Ω) of better than 10 dB to 200 MHz.  The nominal \ncommon -mode input voltage to the part is V POS/2, but the AD8366 \ncan be dc -coupled to parts with lower common modes if the se \nparts can sink current.  The amount of current sinking required \ndepends on the input common -mode level and is given by  \nISINK (per leg ) = ( VPOS/2 − VICM)/100  \nThe i nput common -mode range is 1.5 V to V POS/2. \nOUTPUTS  \nThe outputs of the digitally -controlled  VGAs  are differential and  \ncan be either ac - or dc -coupled.  The AD8366 synthesizes  a 25 Ω \ndifferential output impedance, with a return loss (re: 25 Ω) of \nbetter than 10 dB to 120 MHz . The nominal common -mode \noutput voltage is V POS/2; however, it  can be lowered or raised  by \ndriving the VCMA or VCMB pins.  OUTPUT DIFFERENTIAL OFFSET CORRECTION  \nTo prevent significant levels of offset from appearing at the \noutputs of the AD8366, each digitally controlled VGA has a \ndifferential offset correction loop, as shown in Figure 47. This \nloop senses any differential offset at the output and corrects for it by injecting an opposing  current at the input differential ground.  \nThe lo op is able to correct for input dc  offsets of up to ± 20 m V. \nBecaus e the loop automatically nulls out any dc or low  frequency \noffset, the effect of the loop is to introduce a high- pass corner into \nthe transfer function of the digitally controlled VGA . The \nlocation of this high- pass corner depends on both the gain \nsetting and the value of the capacitor connected  to the OFS x pin \n(OFSA  for D VGA A and OFSB  for D VGA B) and is given by  \n( )( )\n( ) 10 2π4000 1.037 4300kHz, 3++=\nOFSGC\nHPdBCf\nw\nhere:   \nGC is the gain code (a value from 0 to 63) . \nCOFS is the value of the capacitance connected to OFSA or OFSB, \nin picofarads (pF).  \nThe offset correction loop can be disabled by grounding either OFSA or OFSB.  \ngm1 gm2INP\nINM\nOFFSET\nCOMPENSATION\nLOOPVARIABLE-GAIN\nSTAGEOUTPUT\nBUFFER\nZ AIOUT P\nOUTM\nCOFS\n07584-073\nF\nigure 47. Differential Offset Correction Loop   \nOUTPUT COMMON -MODE CO NTROL  \nTo interface to ADCs that require different input common -mode  \nvoltages, the AD8366 has an adjustable output common -mode \nlevel.  The output common -mode level is normally set to V POS/2; \nhowever, it can be changed between 1.6 V and 3 V by driving \nthe VCM A pin or the VCMB pin.

Input Equivalent Circuit for VCMA   \nAD8366  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 16 of 28 GAIN CONTROL INTERFA CE \nThe AD8366 provides two methods of digital  gain control: \nserial or parallel.  When the SENB pin is pulled low , the part  \nis in parallel gain control mode. In this mode, the two digitally \ncontrolled VGAs  can be programmed simultaneously, or one at \na time, depending on the levels at DENA and DENB. If the SENB  \npin is pulled high, the part is in serial gain control mode, with \nPin 24, Pin 23, and Pin 22 corresponding to the C S, SDAT , and \nSCLK signals, respectively.  \nThe voltage gain of the AD8 366 is well approximated by  \nGain  (dB) = GainCode  × 0.253 + 4.5 \nNote that at several major transitions (15 to 16, 31 to 32, and 47 to  \n48), the gain changes significantly less (0  dB step) or significantly  \nmore (0.5  dB step) than the desired 0.25  dB step. This is inherent  \nin the design of the part and is related to the p artitioning of the \nvariable gain block into a fine -gain and a coarse -gain section.  –1.0–0.8–0.6–0.4–0.200.20.40.60.81.0\n02.55.07.510.012.515.017.520.022.525.0\n0 510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60\nGAIN STE P ERROR (dB)GAIN (dB)\nGAIN CODE\n07584-063 \nFigure 49.

B | Page 17 of 28 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nBASIC CONNECTIONS  \nFigure 50 shows the basic connections for operating the AD8366 .  \nA volt age from 4.75 V to 5.25 V must  be applied to the sup ply \npins. Each s upply pin must  be decoupled with at least one low \ninductance, surface -mount cerami c capacitor of 0.1  µF placed as \nclose as possible to the device.  \nThe differential input impedance is 200 Ω and sits at a no minal \ncommon -mode voltage of V POS/2. The inputs can  be dc -coupled \nor ac-coupled. If using direct dc coupling, the common -mode \nvoltage, V CM, can range from 1.5 V to V POS/2.  The output buffers of the AD8366 are low impedance around \n25 Ω designed to drive ADC inputs. The output co mmon -mode \nvoltage defaults t o VPOS/2; however , it can be adjusted by applying a \ndesired external voltage to V CMA/VCM B. The common -mode \nvoltage can be adjusted from 1.6 V to 3.0  V without significant \nharmonic distortion degradation.  \nTo enable the AD8366, the ENBL pin must be pulled  high. Taking  \nENBL low disables the device, reducing current consumption to \napproximately 3 mA at ambient temperature.  \n \nVPSIA\nIPPA\nIPMA\nENBL\nICOM\nIPMB\nIPPB\nVPSIBBIT0/CS\nBIT1/SDAT\nBIT2/SCLK\nBIT3\nOCOM\nBIT4\nBIT5\nDENADECBOFSBCCMBVCMBVPSOBOPPBOPMBDENB\nDECAOFSACCMAVCMAVPSOAOPPAOPMASENBVPOS\nAD8366\nVPOS0.01µF\n0.01µF\n0.01µF8200pF\n8200pF0.01µF\n0.01µF\n0.01µF0.01µFVPOS\n0.1µF 0.1µF\nVPOS\n0.1µF 0.1µFVPOS\n0.1µF 0.1µF\nPARALLEL/SERIAL\nCONTROL INTERFACE (PCI)CHANNEL A\nOUTPUT\nCHANNEL B\nOUTPUTCHANNEL A\nINPUT\nCHANNEL B\nINPUT\n07584-046 \nFigure 50.

Direct Conversion Receiver Block Diagram   \nDIRECT CONVERSION RECEIVER DESIGN  \nA direct conversion receiver directly demodulates an RF modulated  \ncarri er to baseband frequencies, where the signals can be detected \nand the conveyed  information recovered. Eliminating the IF \nstages and directly converting the signal to effectively zero IF \nresults in reduced component count. The i mage problems \nassociated with the traditional superheterodyne architectures  \ncan be ignored as well. However , there are different challenges \nassociated with direct conversion that  include LO leakage, dc  \noffsets , quadrature i mperfections , and image r ejection.  LO \nleakage causes self mixing that results in squaring of the LO waveform which generates a dc  offset tha t falls in band for the \ndirect conversion receiver. Residual dc offsets create a similar \ninterfering signal that falls in band. I/Q amplitude and phase \nmismatch lead to degraded SNR performance  and poor image \nrejection in the direct conversion system . Figure 51 shows the \nblock diagram for a direct conversion receiver system.  \nQUADRATURE ERRORS AND IMAGE REJECTION  \nAn overall RF -to-baseband EVM performance was measured \nwith the ADL5380 IQ demodulator preceding the AD8366, as shown in Figure 56. In this setup , no LC low -pass filters were used \nbetween the ADL5380 and AD8366. A 1900 MHz W -CDMA  RF \nsignal with a 3.84 MHz symbol rate was used. The local o scillator \n(LO) is set at 1900 MHz to obtain a z ero IF baseband signal. \nThe gain  of the AD8366 is set to maximum gain (~20. 25 dB). \nFigure 52 shows the SNR vs. the input power of the cascaded \nsystem for a 5 MHz analysis bandwidth. The broad input power \nrange over which the system exhibits strong SNR performance reflects the superior dynamic range of the AD8366 . \n051015202530354045\n–75 –65 –55 –45 –35 –25 –15 –5 5SNR (dB)\nINPUT POWER (dBm)\n07584-048 \nFigure 52.

Appropriate image rejection is critical  \nbecause the image power can be much higher than that of the desired signal, thereby plaguing the downconver sion process. \nAmplitude and phase balance between the I/Q channels are critical for high levels of image rejection. Image rejection of greater than 47  dB was measured for the combined ADL5380 \nand the AD8366 for  a 5 MHz baseband frequency , as seen in \nFigure 53. This level of image rejection corresponds to a ±0.5° \nphase mismatch and a ±0.05 dB of amplitude mismatch for the com bined ADL5380 and AD8366. Looking back to Figure 7  and \nFigure 10, the AD8366 exhibits only ±0.05 dB of amplitude mismatch  \nand ±0.05\no of phase mismatch , thus implying that the AD8366 \ndoes not introduce additional amplitude and phase imbalance.  \n25303540455055\n900 1500 1300 1100 1700 1900 2100 2300 2500 2700 2900\nRF FRE QUENCY (MHz)IMAGE REJECTION (dB)\n07584-049 \nFigure 53.

Figure 55 \nshows the IMD3 performance vs . frequency for a 2  V p-p \ncomposite output. The IMD3 performance was also measured \nfor the combined ADL5380 and AD8366 system,  as shown in \nFigure 56, with  an FFT spectrum analyzer. An FFT spectrum \nanalyzer works very similar to a typical ADC, the input signal  \nis digitized at a high sampling rate that  is then passed through an \nantialiasing  filter. The resulting signal is transformed to the \nfrequency domain  using fast Fourier t ransforms (FFT).  \nThe single -ended RF signal from the source generator is converted  \nto a differentia l signal using a balun that  gets demodulated and \ndown converted to differential IF signals through the ADL5380. This differential IF signal drive s the AD8366, thus eliminating \nthe need for low frequency baluns.

B | Page 21 of 28 BASEBAND INTERFACE  \nIn most direct -conversion receiver designs, it is desirable to select  a \nwanted carrier within a specified band. The desired channel can be \ndemodulated by tuning the LO to the appropriate carrier frequency. \nIf the desired RF band contains multiple carriers of interest, the adjacent carriers would also be down converted to a lower IF frequency. These adjacent carriers can be a problem if they are large relative to the desired carrier because  they can overdrive  \nthe baseband signal detection circuitry. As a result, it is often necessary to insert a filter to provide sufficient rejection of the adjacent carriers.  \nIt is necessary to consider the overall source and load impedance  \npresented by the AD8366 and the ADC input to design the  \nfilter network. The differential baseband outp ut impedance of \nthe AD8366 is 25 Ω and is designed to drive a high impedance \nADC input. It may be desirable to terminate the ADC input down \nto the lower impedance by using a terminating  resistor, such as \n500 Ω. The terminating resistor helps to better define the input impedance at the ADC input at the cost of a slightly reduced gain . The order and type of filter network depends on the desired high  \nfrequency rejection required, pass -band ripp le, and group delay.  \nFigure 57 shows the  schematic for a typical fourth -order , Chebyshev , \nlow-pass filter. Table 4 shows the typical values of the filter \ncomponents  for a fourth -order , Chebyshev , low -pass filter  with \na differential source impedance of 25  Ω and a differential load \nimpedance of 200  Ω. \nL1\nL2C1L3\nL4C2 ZLOADZSOURCE\n07584-051 \nFigure 57.

The \nbulk of the characterization w as done us ing an automated VEE \nprogram  to control the equipment as shown in Figure 58. This \nsetup was used to measure P1dB, OIP3, OIP2, IMD2, IMD3,  \nharmonic distortion,  gain,  gain error, supply current , and noise \ndensity. All measurements  were done with a 200 Ω load. All  balun, \noutput matching network , and filter losses were de- embedded. \nGain error was measured with constant input power. A ll other \nmeasurements were done  on 2 V  p-p (4 dBm , re: 200 Ω) on  the output of the device under test ( DUT ), and 2  V p-p composite  \noutput  for two -tone measurements. To measure harmonic \ndistortion , band -pass and band -reject filters were used on  \nthe input and output of the DUT.  \nFigure 59 shows the setup used to make  differential measurements.  \nAll measurements on this setup were done in a 50 Ω  system and \npost processed to reference  the measurements to a 200 Ω system.  \nGain and phase mismatch we re measured with 2 V  p-p on the \noutput, and small signal frequency response s were measured \nwith −30 dBm on the input of the DUT . \n \n \nData Sheet AD8366\n \nRev.
