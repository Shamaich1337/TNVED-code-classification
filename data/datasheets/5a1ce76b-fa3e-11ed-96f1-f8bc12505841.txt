The\nLTC4411 is housed in a 5-lead 1mm profile SOT-23package.\nThe LTC4411 contains a 140m Ω P-channel MOSFET con-\nnecting IN to OUT. During normal forward operation, thedrop across the MOSFET is regulated to as low as 28mV.\nQuiescent current is less than 40 µA for load currents up to\n100mA. If the output voltage exceeds the input voltage, theMOSFET is turned off and less than 1 µA of reverse current\nflows from OUT to IN. Maximum forward current is limited\nto a constant 2.6A (typical) and internal thermal limiting cir-cuits protect the part during fault conditions.\nAn open-drain STAT pin indicates conduction status. The\nSTAT pin can be used to drive an auxiliary P-channelMOSFET power switch connecting an alternate power\nsource when the LTC4411 is not conducting forward\ncurrent.\nAn active-high control pin turns off the LTC4411 and\nreduces current consumption to less than 25 µA. When\nshut off, the LTC4411 indicates this condition with a lowvoltage on the status signal.\nFigure 1.

LTC4411 vs Schottky Diode\nForward Conduction CharacteristicsOPERATIOU\nThe LTC4411 operation is described with the aid of\nFigure 3. Forward regulation for the LTC4411 has three\noperation modes depending on the magnitude of the loadcurrent. For small load currents, the LTC4411 will provide\na constant voltage drop; this operating mode is referred to\nas “constant V\nON” regulation. As the current exceeds I FWD\nthe voltage drop will increase linearly with the current with\na slope of 1/R ON; this operating mode is referred to as\n“constant R ON” regulation. As the current increases fur-\nther, exceeding I MAX, the forward voltage drop will in-\ncrease rapidly; this operating mode is referred to as\n“constant I ON” regulation. The characteristics for the\nfollowing parameters: R FWD, RON, VFWD, IFWD, and I MAX\nare specified with the aid of Figure 3.\nOperation begins when the power source at IN rises above\nthe UVLO voltage of 2.4V (typ) and the CTL (control) pinis low. If only the voltage at the IN pin is present, the power\nsource to LTC4411 (V\nDD) will be supplied from the IN pin.\nThe amplifier (A) will deliver a voltage proportional to the\ndifference between V IN and V OUT to the gate (V GATE) of the\ninternal P-channel MOSFET (P1), driving this gate voltagebelow V\nIN. This will turn on P1. As P1 conducts, V OUT will\nbe pulled up towards V IN. The LTC4411 will then control\nVGATE to maintain a low forward voltage drop. The system\nis now in forward regulation and the load at OUT will bepowered from the supply at IN. As the load current varies,V\nGATE will be controlled to maintain a low forward voltage\ndrop. If the load current exceeds P1’s ability to deliver the\ncurrent, as V GATE approaches GND, the P1 will behave as\na fixed resistor, with resistance R ON, whereby the forward\nvoltage will increase with increased load current. As I LOAD\nincreases further (I LOAD > IMAX), the LTC4411 will regulate\nthe load current as described below. During the forward\nregulation mode of operation the STAT pin will be an opencircuit.\nVFWDIOC\nIMAX\nIFWD\nFORWARD VOLTAGE (V)0LOAD CURRENT (A)3.0\n2.52.01.51.00.5\n0\n0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0\n4411 F03TA = 40 °C\nSLOPE\n1/RON\nSLOPE1/R\nFWDSCHOTTKYDIODELTC4411\n6LTC4411\n4411faAPPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\nINTRODUCTION\nThe LTC4411 is intended for power control applications\nthat include low loss diode ORing, fully automatic\nswitchover from a primary to an auxiliary source of power,microcontroller controlled switchover from a primary to\nan auxiliary source of power, load sharing between two or\nmore batteries, charging of multiple batteries from asingle charger and high side power switching.Figure 4.

This will cause the output voltage to drop as the\nload current exceeds the amount of current that theLTC4411 can supply. This condition will increase the\npower consumption within the LTC4411.\nWhen an alternate power source is connected to the\noutput, the LTC4411 will sense the increased voltage at\nOUT, and the amplifier (A) will increase the voltage at\nV\nGATE. When V OUT is higher than V IN + VRTO, the internal\npower source for the LTC4411 (V DD) will be diverted to\nsource current from the OUT pin. At the same time V GATE\nwill be pulled to V DD, which will turn off P1. The system is\nnow in the reverse turn-off mode. Power to the load is\nbeing delivered from an alternate supply, and only a smallOPERATIOU\ncurrent is drawn from IN to sense the potential V IN. During\nreverse turn-off mode the STAT pin will sink 10 µA to\nindicate that the diode is not conducting.\nWhen the CTL input is asserted (high), P1 will have its gate\nvoltage pulled high, and the STAT pin will sink 10 µA. A 3 µA\npull-down current on the CTL pin will ensure a low level at\nthis input if it is left open circuited.\nThe overtemperature condition is detected when the\ninternal die temperature increases beyond 150 °C. The\novertemperature condition will cause the gate amplifier(A) as well as P1 to be shut off. When the internal die\ntemperature cools to below 140 °C, the amplifier will turn\non and revert to normal operation. Note that prolongedoperation under overtemperature conditions will degrade\nreliability.\nAutomatic PowerPath Control\nFigure 1 illustrates an application circuit for automatic\nswitchover of a load between a battery and a wall adapteror other power input. With initial application of the battery,\nthe load will be charged up as the LTC4411 turns on. The\nLTC4411 will control the gate voltage of its internal MOSFETto reduce the MOSFET’s voltage drop to a low forward\nvoltage (V\nFWD). The system is now in the forward regula-\nLTC4411\n74411fation mode, the forward voltage will be kept low by control-\nling the gate voltage of the internal MOSFET to react to\nchanges in load current. Should the wall adapter input be\napplied, the Schottky diode will pull up the output voltage,connected to the load, above the battery voltage. TheLTC4411 will sense that the output voltage is higher thanthe battery voltage and will turn off the internal MOSFET.The STAT pin will then sink current indicating an auxiliary\ninput is connected. The battery is now supplying no load\ncurrent and all load current flows through the Schottkydiode.\nMicrocontrolled PowerPath Monitoring and Control\nFigure 6 illustrates an application circuit for microcontroller\nmonitoring and control of two power sources. The\nmicrocontroller’s analog inputs, perhaps with the aid of a\nresistor voltage divider, monitors each supply input andcommands the LTC4411 through the CTL input. Back-to-back MOSFETs are used so that the parasitic drain-sourcediode will not power the load when the MOSFET is turnedoff (dual MOSFETs in one package are commercially\navailable).\nFigure 5.

This concept can apply to more than two batteries.The STAT pin provides information as to which batteriesare being charged.
