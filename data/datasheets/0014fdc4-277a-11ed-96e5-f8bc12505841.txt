SpecificationR\nArchitectural Description\nVirtex-5 FPGA Array Overview\nVirtex-5 devices are user-programmable gate arrays with various configurable elements and embedded cores optimized for \nhigh-density and high-performance system designs. Virtex-5 devices implement the following functionality:\n•I/O blocks provide the interface between package pins \nand the internal configurable logic. Most popular and leading-edge I/O standards are supported by programmable I/O blocks (IOBs). The IOBs can be connected to very flexible ChipSync logic for enhanced source-synchronous interfacing. Source-synchronous optimizations include per-bit deskew (on both input and output signals), data serializers/deserializers, clock dividers, and dedicated I/O and local clocking resources.\n•Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs), the basic logic \nelements for Xilinx® FPGAs, provide combinatorial and synchronous logic as well as distributed memory and SRL32 shift register capability. Virtex-5 FPGA CLBs are based on real 6-input look-up table technology and provide superior capab ilities and performance \ncompared to previous generations of programmable logic.\n•Block RAM modules provide fl exible 36 Kbit true dual-\nport RAM that are cascadable to form larger memory blocks. In addition, Virtex-5 FPGA block RAMs contain optional programmable FIFO logic for increased device utilization. Each block RAM can also be configured as \ntwo independent 18 Kbit true dual-port RAM blocks, providing memory granularity for designs needing smaller RAM blocks. \n•Cascadable embedded DSP48E slices with 25 x 18 \ntwo’s complement mult ipliers and 48-bit \nadder/subtracter/accumulator provide massively parallel DSP algorithm support. In addition, each DSP48E slice can be used to perform bitwise logical functions.\n•Clock Management Tile (CMT) blocks provide the most \nflexible, highest-performance clocking for FPGAs. Each CMT contains two Digital Clock Manager (DCM) blocks (self-calibrating, fully digital), and one PLL block (self-calibrating, analog) for clock distribution delay compensation, clock multiplication/division, coarse-/fine-grained clock phase shifting, and input clock jitter filtering.Additionally, LXT, SXT, TXT, and FXT devices also contain:\n•Integrated Endpoint blocks for PCI Express designs \nproviding x1, x4, or x8 PCI Express Endpoint functionality. When used in conjunction with RocketIO transceivers, a complete PCI Express Endpoint can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic utilization.\n•10/100/1000 Mb/s Ethernet media-access control \nblocks offer Ethernet capability.\nLXT and SXT devices contain:•RocketIO GTP transceivers capable of running up to \n3.75 Gb/s. Each GTP transceiver supports full-duplex, clock-and-data recovery.\nTXT and FXT devices contain:•GTX transceivers capable of running up to 6.5 Gb/s. \nEach GTX transceiver supports full-duplex, clock-and-data recovery.\nFXT devices contain:•Embedded IBM PowerPC 440 RISC CPUs. Each \nPowerPC 440 CPU is capable of running up to 550 MHz. Each PowerPC 440 CPU also has an APU (Auxiliary Processor Unit) interface that supports hardware acceleration, and an integrated cross-bar for high data throughput.\nThe general routing matrix (GRM) provides an array of \nrouting switches between each internal component. Each programmable element is tied to a switch matrix, allowing multiple connections to the general routing matrix. The \noverall programmable interconnection is hierarchical and designed to support high-speed designs. In Virtex-5 devices, the routing connections are optimized to support CLB interconnection in the fewest number of “hops.” Reducing hops greatly increases post place-and-route (PAR) design performance.\nAll programmable elements, including the routing \nresources, are controlled by values stored in static storage elements. These values are loaded into the FPGA during configuration and can be reloaded to change the functions of the programmable elements.\nVirtex-5 Family Overview\nDS100 (v5.1) August 21, 2015 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 7R\nVirtex-5 FPGA Features\nThis section briefly describes the features of the Virtex-5 family of FPGAs.\nInput/Output Blocks (SelectIO)\nIOBs are programmable and can be categorized as follows:\n•Programmable single-ended or differential (LVDS) \noperation\n•Input block with an optional single data rate (SDR) or \ndouble data rate (DDR) register\n•Output block with an optional SDR or DDR register\n•Bidirectional block\n•Per-bit deskew circuitry\n•Dedicated I/O and regional clocking resources\n•Built-in data serializer/deserializer\nThe IOB registers are either edge-triggered D-type flip-flops \nor level-sensitive latches.\nIOBs support the following single-ended standards:\n•LVTTL\n•LVCMOS (3.3V, 2.5V, 1.8V, 1.5V, and 1.2V)\n•PCI (33 and 66 MHz)\n•PCI-X\n•GTL and GTLP\n•HSTL 1.5V and 1.8V (Class I, II, III, and IV)\n•HSTL 1.2V (Class 1)\n•SSTL 1.8V and 2.5V (Class I and II)\nThe Digitally Controlled Impedance (DCI) I/O feature can be \nconfigured to provide on-chip termination for each single-ended I/O standard and some differential I/O standards.\nThe IOB elements also support the following differential \nsignaling I/O standards:\n•LVDS and Extended LVDS (2.5V only)\n•BLVDS (Bus LVDS)\n•ULVDS\n•Hypertransport™\n•Differential HSTL 1.5V and 1.8V (Class I and II)\n•Differential SSTL 1.8V and 2.5V (Class I and II)\n•RSDS (2.5V point-to-point)\nTwo adjacent pads are used for each differential pair. Two or \nfour IOB blocks connect to one switch matrix to access the routing resources.\nPer-bit deskew circuitry allows for programmable signal \ndelay internal to the FPGA. Per-bit deskew flexibly provides fine-grained increments of delay to carefully produce a range of signal delays. This is especially useful for synchronizing signal edges in source-synchronous interfaces.\nGeneral purpose I/O in select locations (eight per bank) are \ndesigned to be “regional clock capable” I/O by adding special hardware connections fo r I/O in the same locality. \nThese regional clock inputs are distributed within a limited region to minimize clock skew between IOBs. Regional I/O clocking supplements the global clocking resources.Data serializer/deserializer ca pability is added to every I/O \nto support source-synchronous interfaces. A serial-to-parallel converter with associated clock divider is included in the input path, and a parallel-to-serial converter in the output path.\nAn in-depth guide to the Virtex-5 FPGA IOB is found in the\nVirtex-5 FPGA Tri-Mode Ethernet MAC User Guide . \nConfigurable Logic Blocks (CLBs)\nA Virtex-5 FPGA CLB resource is made up of two slices. \nEach slice is equivalent and contains:\n•Four function generators\n•Four storage elements\n•Arithmetic logic gates\n•Large multiplexers\n•Fast carry look-ahead chain\nThe function generators are configurable as 6-input LUTs or \ndual-output 5-input LUTs. SLICEMs in some CLBs can be configured to operate as 32-bit shift registers (or 16-bit x 2 shift registers) or as 64-bit distributed RAM. In addition, the four storage elements can be configured as either edge-triggered D-type flip-flops or level sensitive latches. Each CLB has internal fast interconnect and connects to a switch matrix to access general routing resources.\nThe Virtex-5 FPGA CLBs are further discussed in the\nVirtex-5 FPGA User Guide .\nBlock RAM\nThe 36 Kbit true dual-port RAM block resources are \nprogrammable from 32K x 1 to 512 x 72, in various depth and width configurations. In addition, each 36-Kbit block can also be configured to operate as two, independent 18-Kbit dual-port RAM blocks. \nEach port is totally synchronous and independent, offering \nthree “read-during-write” modes. Block RAM is cascadable to implement large embedded storage blocks. Additionally, back-end pipeline registers, clock control circuitry, built-in FIFO support, ECC, and byte write enable features are also provided as options.\nThe block RAM feature in Virtex-5 devices is further \ndiscussed in the Virtex-5 FPGA User Guide .\nVirtex-5 Family Overview\n8 www.xilinx.com DS100 (v5.1) August 21, 2015\nProduct SpecificationR\nGlobal Clocking\nThe CMTs and global-clock multiplexer buffers provide a \ncomplete solution for designing high-speed clock networks.\nEach CMT contains two DCMs and one PLL. The DCMs \nand PLLs can be used independently or extensively cascaded. Up to six CMT blocks are available, providing up to eighteen total clock generator elements.\nEach DCM provides familiar cl ock generation capability. To \ngenerate deskewed internal or external clocks, each DCM can be used to eliminate clock distribution delay. The DCM also provides 90°, 180°, and 270° phase-shifted versions of the output clocks. Fine-grained phase shifting offers higher-resolution phase adjustment with fraction of the clock period increments. Flexible frequency synthesis provides a clock output frequency equal to a fractional or integer multiple of the input clock frequency.\nTo augment the DCM capability, Virtex-5 FPGA CMTs also \ncontain a PLL. This block provides reference clock jitter filtering and further frequency synthesis options.\nVirtex-5 devices have 32 global-clock MUX buffers. The \nclock tree is designed to be differential. Differential clocking helps reduce jitter and duty cycle distortion.\nDSP48E Slices\nDSP48E slice resources contain a 25 x 18 two’s complement multiplier and a 48-bit adder/subtacter/accumulator. Each DSP48E slice also contains extensive cascade capability to efficiently \nimplement high-speed DSP algorithms.\nThe Virtex-5 FPGA DSP48E slice features are further \ndiscussed in Virtex-5 FPGA XtremeDSP Design \nConsiderations .\nRouting Resources\nAll components in Virtex-5 devices use the same \ninterconnect scheme and the same access to the global \nrouting matrix. In addition, the CLB-to-CLB routing is designed to offer a complete set of connectivity in as few hops as possible. Timing models are shared, greatly improving the predictability of the performance for high-\nspeed designs.\nBoundary Scan\nBoundary-Scan instructions and associated data registers support a standard methodology for accessing and configuring Virtex-5 devi ces, complying with IEEE \nstandards 1149.1 and 1532.Configuration\nVirtex-5 devices are configured by loading the bitstream into internal configuration memory using one of the following modes:\n•Slave-serial mode\n•Master-serial mode\n•Slave SelectMAP mode\n•Master SelectMAP mode\n•Boundary-Scan mode (IEEE-1532 and -1149)\n•SPI mode (Serial Peripheral Interface standard Flash)\n•BPI-up/BPI-down modes (Byte-wide Peripheral \ninterface standard x8 or x16 NOR Flash)\nIn addition, Virtex-5 devices also support the following \nconfiguration options:\n•256-bit AES bitstream decry ption for IP protection\n•Multi-bitstream management (MBM) for cold/warm boot \nsupport\n•Parallel configuration bu s width auto-detection\n•Parallel daisy chain\n•Configuration CRC and E CC support for the most \nrobust, flexible device integrity checking\nVirtex-5 device configuration is further discussed in the\nVirtex-5 FPGA Configuration Guide .\nSystem Monitor\nFPGAs are an important building block in high \navailability/reliability infrastruc ture. Therefore,  there is need \nto better monitor the on-chip physical environment of the FPGA and its immediate surroundings within the system. For the first time, the Virtex-5 family System Monitor facilitates easier m onitoring of the FPGA  and its external \nenvironment. Every member of the Virtex-5 family contains a System Monitor block. The System Monitor is built around a 10-bit 200kSPS ADC (Analog-to -Digital Converter). This \nADC is used to digitize a nu mber of on-chip sensors to \nprovide information about the physical environment within the FPGA. On-chip sensors include a temperature sensor and power supply sensors. Access to the external environment is provided via a number of external analog input channels. These analog inputs are general purpose and can be used to digitize a wide variety of voltage signal types. Support for unipolar, bipolar, and true differential input schemes is provided. There is full access to the on-chip sensors and external channels via the JTAG TAP , allowing the existing JTAG infrastructure on the PC board to be used for analog test and advanced diagnostics during development or after deployment in the field. The System Monitor is fully operational after power up and before configuration of the FPGA. System Monitor does not require an explicit instantiation in a design to gain access to its basic functionality. This allows the System Monitor to be used even at a late stage in the design cycle.\nThe Virtex-5 FPGA System Monitor is further discussed in \ntheVirtex-5 FPGA System Monitor User Guide .\nVirtex-5 Family Overview\nDS100 (v5.1) August 21, 2015 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 9R\nVirtex-5 LXT, SXT, TXT, and FXT Platform Features\nThis section briefly describes blocks availa ble only in LXT, SXT, TXT, and FXT devices.\nTri-Mode (10/100/1000 Mb/s) Ethernet MACs\nVirtex-5 LXT, SXT, TXT, and FXT devices contain up to eight \nembedded Ethernet MACs, two per Ethernet MAC block.
