There is no parasitic body diode betw een \ndrain and source of the MOSFET, so the SY6280 \nprevents current flow from out to input when out be ing \nexternally forced to a higher voltage than vin when  \nchip is disabled. \n \nOver-current protection  \nWhen the over-current condition is sensed, the gate  \nof the pass switch is modulated to achieve constant  \noutput current. Under output short circuit conditio ns, \nthe normal current limit folded back 50%. If the ov er \ncurrent condition presists for a long enough time, the \njunction temperature may exceed 130C, and over-\ntemperature protection will shut down the part. Onc e \nthe chip temperature drops to 110C, the part will r estart. \n Supply Filter Capacitor  \nIn order to prevent the input voltage drooping duri ng \nhot-plug events, a 10uF ceramic capacitor form V IN  to \nGND is strongly recommended. However, higher \ncapacitor values could reduce the voltage droop on the \ninput further. Furthermore, an output short will ca use \nringing on the input without the input capacitor. I t \ncould destroy the internal circuitry when the input  \ntransient exceed 6V which is the absolute maximum \nsupply voltage even for a short duration. \nCurrent Limiting Setting  \nCurrent limiting is programmable to protect the \npower source from over current and short circuit \nconditions. Connect a resistor R SET  from this ISET pin \nto GND to program the current limit:  \nIlim (A)=6800 /  Rset (ohm).\nPCB Layout Guide  \nFor best performance of the SY6280 , the following \nguidelines must be strictly followed: \n/head2right Keep all V BUS  traces as short and wide as possible \nand use at least 2 ounce copper for all V BUS  traces. \n/head2right Place a ground plane under all circuitry to lower \nboth resistance and inductance and improve DC \nand transient performance. \n/head2right Locate the output capacitor as close to the \nconnectors as possible to lower impedance(mainly inductance) between the port and the capacitor \nand improve transient performance. \n/head2right Input and output capacitors should be placed \nclosed to the IC and connected to ground plane to \nreduce noise coupling. \n/head2right Locate the ceramic bypass capacitors as close as \npossible to the V IN  pins and V OUT  pins of SY6280. \n \n \n \nPCB Layout Guide(SOT23-5) \n \n \n \n  AN_SY6280 \n  \nAN_SY6280 Rev. 0.1        Silergy Corp.
