It integrates overtemperature, \novercurrent, overvoltage (active  clamp) and ESD protected logic level \nfunctionality. The ZXMS6004FF is ideal as a general purpose switch \ndriven from 3.3V or 5V  microcontrollers in harsh environments where \nstandard MOSFETs are not rugged enough.  \n \nApplications  \n\uf0b7 Especially suited for loads with a high in-rush current  such as \nlamps  and motors  \n\uf0b7 All types of resistive , inductive  and capacitive loads  in switching \napplications  \n\uf0b7 μC compatible power switch es for 12V and 24V DC applications  \n\uf0b7 Automotive rated \n\uf0b7 Replaces electromechanical relays and discrete circuits  \n\uf0b7 Linear mode capabilit ies – the current -limiting protection circuitry \nis designed to de -activate at low V DS to minimize  on state power \ndissipation. The maximum DC operating current is therefore \ndetermined by the thermal capability of the package/board \ncombination, rather than by the protection circuitry. This does not \ncompromise the product’s ability to self -protect at low  VDS.

The drain current is restricted only when the device is in saturation (see graph ‘ Typical Output Characteristic’ ). This allows the device to be used in the  \nfully on-state without interference from the current limit. The device is fully protected at all drain currents, as the low power dissip ation generated outsid e \nsaturation makes current limit unnecessary.  \n  9. Over temperature protection is designed to prevent device  from destruction under fault conditions. Fault conditions are considered as “outside” normal   \noperating range, so this part is not designed to withstand ove rtemperature for extended periods . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nZXMS6004FF  \nDocument number: DS 33609  Rev. 9 - 2 6 of 9 \nwww.diodes.com   April 2022  \n©  2022 Copyright Diodes Incorporated.

It features a logic-level input, making it suitable for direct interfacing with microcontrollers operating at 3.3V or 5V. The device integrates several protection mechanisms, including overtemperature, overcurrent, and overvoltage protection, making it ideal for use in harsh environments where standard MOSFETs may fail.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Power Management:** Used as a general-purpose switch for controlling loads with high in-rush currents, such as lamps and motors.
- **Switching Applications:** Suitable for all types of resistive, inductive, and capacitive loads.
- **Microcontroller Compatible Power Switches:** Ideal for 12V and 24V DC applications.
- **Automotive Applications:** Designed to replace electromechanical relays and discrete circuits, particularly in automotive environments.
- **Linear Mode Capabilities:** The current-limiting protection circuitry allows for operation at low VDS, minimizing on-state power dissipation.

This component is particularly beneficial in applications requiring robust performance and reliability, such as automotive systems and industrial controls.
