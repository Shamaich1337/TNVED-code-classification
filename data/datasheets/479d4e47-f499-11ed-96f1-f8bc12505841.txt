These \namplifiers  use a new, patented trimming technique that \nachieves superior performance without laser trimming. All  \nare fully specified to operat e on a 3 V to 5 V single supply.  \nThe combination of low offsets, very low input bias currents, \nand high speed make these amplifiers useful in a wide variety  of applications. Filters, integrators, diode amplifiers, shunt current sensors, and high impedance  sensors all benefit from \nthe combination of performance features. Audio and other ac applications benefit from the wide bandwidth and low distortion.  \nFor the most cost- sensitive applications, the D grades offer this \nac performance with lower dc precision at a lower price point.  \nApplications for these amplifiers include audio amplification for portable devices, portable phone headsets, bar code scanners, portable instruments, cellular PA controls, and \nmultipole filters.  \nThe ability to swing rail -to-rail at  both the input and output \nenables designers to buffer CMOS ADCs, DACs, ASICs, and \nother wide output swing devices in single- supply systems.

I | Page 15 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe AD8601/AD8602/AD8604 family of amplifiers are rail -to-rail \ninput and output , precision CMOS amplifiers that operate from \n2.7 V to 5.0 V  of the power supply voltage. These amplifiers use \nAnalog Devices , Inc., DigiTrim® technology to achieve a higher \ndegree of precision than available from most CMOS amplifiers. \nDigiTrim technology  is a method of trimming the offset voltage  \nof the amplifier after it has been assembled. The advantage  in post -\npackage trimming lies in the fact that it corrects any offset voltag es \ndue to the mechanical stresses of assembly. This technology is \nscalable  and used with every  package option, including the 5 -lead \nSOT -23, providing lower offset voltages than previously achieved  \nin th ese small packages.  \nThe DigiTrim process is completed  at the factory and does not \nadd additional pins to the amplifier. All AD860x amplifiers are \navailable in standard op amp pinouts, making DigiTrim completely  transparent to the user. The AD860x can be us ed in any \nprecision  op amp application.  \nThe input stag e of the amplifier is a true rail -to-rail \narchitecture, allowing the input common -mode voltage range \nof the op amp to extend to both positive and negative supply rails. The voltage swing of the output s tage is also rail -to-rail \nand is achieved by using an NMOS and PMOS transistor pair \nconnected in a common -source configuration. The maximum \noutput voltage swing is proportional to the output current, and \nlarger currents limit how close the output voltage c an get to the \nsupply rail , which is a characteristic o f all rail -to-rail output \namplifiers. With 1 mA of output current, the output voltage can \nreach within 20 mV of the positive rail and within 15 mV of the negative rail. At light loads of >100 k Ω, the ou tput swings \nwithin ~1 mV of the supplies.  \nThe open -loop gain of the AD860x is 80 dB, typical, with a load \nof 2 k Ω. Because of the rail -to-rail output configuration, the gain  \nof the output stage and the open -loop gain of the amplifier are \ndependent on the l oad resistance. Open -loop gain decrease s with  \nsmaller load resistances. Again, this is a characteristic inherent \nto all rail -to-rail output amplifiers.  \nRAIL -TO-RAIL INPUT STAGE  \nThe input common- mode voltage range of the AD860x extends \nto both the positive and negative supply voltages. This maximizes  \nthe usabl e voltage range of the amplifier, an important feature \nfor single -supply and low voltage applications. This rail -to-rail \ninput range is achieved by using two input differential pairs, one NMOS and one P MOS, placed in parallel. The NMOS pair \nis active at the upper end of the common -mode voltage range, \nand the PMOS pair is active at the lower end.  The NMOS and PMOS input stages are separately trimmed using DigiTrim to minimize the offset voltage in both differential  pairs. Both NMOS and PMOS input differential \npairs are active in a 500 mV transition region, when the input \ncommon -mode voltage is between approximately 1.5 V and 1 V \nbelow the positive supply voltage. The i nput offset voltage shift s \nslightly i n this tra nsition region, as shown in Figure 9 and \nFigure 10 .The c ommon -mode rejection ratio is  also slightly \nlower when the input common -mode voltage is within this \ntrans ition band. Compared to the Burr -Brown OPA2340UR  rail-\nto-rail input amplifier , shown i n Figure 54, the AD860x, shown \nin Figure 55, exhibits lower offset voltage shift across the entire \ninput common -mode range, including the transition region.  \n0.7\n0.4\n0.1\n–0.2\n–0.5\n–0.8\n–1.1\n–1.4\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nVCM (V)VOS (mV)\n01525-054 \nFigure 54.

I | Page 16 of 24 INPUT OVERVOLTAGE PROTE CTION  \nAs with any semiconducto r device, if a condition could exist \nthat could cause the input voltage to exceed the power supply, \nthe device’s input overvoltage characteristic must be \nconsidered. Excess  input voltage energize s the internal PN \njunctions in the AD860x, allowing current t o flow from the input \nto the supplies . \nThis input current does  not damage the amplifier, provided it is \nlimited to 5 mA or less. This can be ensured by placing a resistor  in \nseries with the input. For example, if the input vol tage could \nexceed the supply b y 5 V, the series resistor should be at least  \n(5 V/5 mA) = 1 k Ω. With the input voltage within the supply \nrails, a minimal amount of current is drawn into the inputs, \nwhich, in turn, causes a negligible voltage drop across the series \nresistor. Therefore, adding the series resistor does  not adversely \naffect circuit pe rformance.  \nOVERDRIVE RECOVERY  \nOverdrive recovery is defined as the time it takes the output of an amplifier to come off the supply rail when recovering from an overload signal. This is tested by placing the amplifier in a closed -loop gain of 10 with an inp ut square wave of 2 V p -p \nwhile the amplifier is powered from either 5 V or 3 V.  \nThe AD860x has excellent recovery time from overload conditions . \nThe output recovers from the positive supply rail within 200 ns at all supply voltages. Recovery from the nega tive rail is within \n500 ns at a 5 V supply, decreasing to within 350 ns when the \ndevice is powered from 2.7 V.  \nPOWER -ON TIME  \nThe p ower -on time is important in portable applications where \nthe supply voltage to the amplifier may be toggled to shut down the d evice to improve battery life. Fast power -up behavior ensures  \nthat the output of the amplifier quickly settle s to its final voltage, \nimproving the power -up speed of the entire system. When the \nsupply voltage reaches a minimum of 2.5 V, the AD860x  settles to  \na valid output within 1 µ s. This turn -on response time is faster \nthan many other precision amplifiers, which can take tens or \nhundreds of microseconds for their outputs to settl e. \nUSING THE AD8602 IN HIGH SOURCE IMPEDANCE \nAPPLICATIONS  \nThe CMOS rail -to-rail input structure of the AD860x allows \nthese amplifiers to have very low input bias currents, typically \n0.2 pA. This allows the AD860x to be used in any application that has a high source impedance or must use large value resistances around the amplifier . For example, the photodiode \namplifier circuit shown in Figure 56 requires a low input bias \ncurrent op amp to reduce output voltage error. The AD8601 minimizes offset errors due to its low input bias current and low offset voltag e. The current through the photodiode is proportional to the incident light  power on its surface. The 4.7 M Ω resistor converts this \ncurrent into a voltage, with the output of the AD8601 increasing at \n4.7 V/ µA. The feedback capacitor reduces excess noise at higher \nfrequencies  by limiting the bandwidth of the circuit to  \n()FC πBWΩM7.421=  (1) \nUsing a 10 pF f eedback capacitor limits the bandwidth to \napproximately 3.3 kHz.  \nAD860110pF\n(OPTIONAL)\nVOUT\n4.7V/µA4.7MΩ\nD1\n01525-056 \nFigure 56. Amplifier Photodiode Circuit  \nHIGH SIDE AND LOW  SIDE,  PRECISION CURRENT \nMONITORING  \nBecause of its low input bias current and low offset voltage, the AD860 x can be used for precision current monitoring. The true \nrail-to-rail input feature of the AD860x allows the amplifier to \nmonitor current on either the high side or the low side. Using both  \namplifiers in an AD8602 provides a simple method for monitoring  \nboth current supply and return paths for load or fault detection. \nFigure 57 and Figure 58 demonstrate both circuits.  \n01525-0571/2AD8602\nRETURN TO\nGROUNDRSENSE\n0.1ΩR1\n100ΩR2\n249kΩ\nQ1\n2N3904MONI TOR\nOUTPUT3V\n3V\n \nFigure 57.

This voltage appears at the \ninverting input of the amplifier due to the feedback correction \naround the op amp. This creates a current through R1 , which  \nin turn, pulls current through R2.

To ensure that the ADCs  or DA Cs achieve their best performance, an  \namplifier often must be used for buffering or signal conditioning . \nThe 750 µ V maximum offset voltage of the AD8601 allows the \namplifier to be used in 12 -bit applications powered from a 3 V \nsingle supply, and its rail- to-rail input and output ensure no \nsignal clipping.  \nFigure 59 shows the AD8601 used as an input buffer amplifier \nto the AD7476, a 12 -bit, 1 MSPS ADC . As with most ADCs , \ntotal harmonic dist ortion (THD) increases with higher source \nimpedances. By using the AD8601 in  a buffer configuration, the \nlow output impedance of the amplifier  minimizes THD while  \nthe high input impedance and low bias current of the op amp minimizes errors due to source i mpedance. The 8 MHz gain  \nbandwidth product of the AD8601 ensures no signal attenua -\ntion up to 500 kHz, which is the maximum Nyquist frequency for the AD7476 . \nVDD\nGNDSCLK\nSDATAVIN\nCS\nAD7476/AD7477RS\nAD86014\n3\n2511µF\nTANT\nSERIA L\nINTER FACE5V\nSUPP LY\n0.1µF 0.1µF 10µF680nFREF193\nµC/µ P\n01525-059 \nFigure 59.

Figure 38 shows the total harmonic \ndistortion plus noise (THD + N) figures for the AD860x. In \nunity gain, the amplifier has a typical  THD + N of 0.004%, or \n−86 dB, even with a load resistance of 600 Ω . This is compliant \nwith the PC100 specification requirements for audio in both \nportable and desktop computers . \nFigure 61 shows how an AD8602 can be interfaced with an AC’97 \ncodec to dri ve the line output. Here, the AD8602 is used as a \nunity -gain buffer from the left and right outputs of the AC’97 \ncodec. The 100 µF output coupling capacitors block dc current \nand the 20 Ω  series resistors protect the amplifier from short \ncircuits at the ja ck. \nNOTES\n1.ADDITIONA L PINS OMITTED FOR CLARIT Y.\n01525-0612\n3\n481VDD\nVSSVDD\nLEFT OUT\nRIGHT OUT5V5V\nAD1881\n(AC’97)AR4\n20ΩC1\n100µF\nR2\n2kΩ +\n5\n67R5\n20ΩC2\n100µF\nR3\n2kΩ +B3529\n263625\nAD8602\nAD8602\n \nFigure 61.
