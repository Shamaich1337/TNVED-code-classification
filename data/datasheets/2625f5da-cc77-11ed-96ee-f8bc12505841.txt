GeneralGeneralGeneralGeneral\nThe Toshiba TLP2745 consists of high-output GaA ℓAs light-emitting diode coupled with a high-gain, high-speed\nphoto detector. It is housed in a thin SO6L package of 2.3 mm (max). The TLP2745 has guaranteed the isolation\nvoltage 5 kVrms and compliant with international safety standards for reinforced insulation. This product can\noperate in power supply voltage 4.5 V to 30 V with the maximum operative temperature of 110 \ue00c. Since TLP2745\nhas guaranteed 3 mA low supply current (I CCL/ICCH), and 1.6 mA low threshold input current(I FLH), it contributes\nto energy saving of devices. It can drive directly from a microcomputer for a low input current. The detector has\na totem-pole output stage with current sourcing and sinking capabilities. The TLP2745 has an internal Faraday\nshield that provides a guaranteed common-mode transient immunity of ±30 kV/ µs. The TLP2745 has a buffer\noutput. An inverter output version, the TLP2748, is also available.\n3. 3. 3. 3.

Precautions for General StoragePrecautions for General StoragePrecautions for General StoragePrecautions for General Storage\n•Avoid storage locations where devices may be exposed to moisture or direct sunlight.\n•Follow the precautions printed on the packing label of the device for transportation and storage.\n•Keep the storage location temperature and humidity within a range of 5 \ue00c to 35 \ue00c and 45 % to 75 %,\nrespectively.\n•Do not store the products in locations with poisonous gases (especially corrosive gases) or in dusty\nconditions.\n•Store the products in locations with minimal temperature fluctuations. Rapid temperature changes during\nstorage can cause condensation, resulting in lead oxidation or corrosion, which will deteriorate the\nsolderability of the leads.\n•When restoring devices after removal from their packing, use anti-static containers.\n•Do not allow loads to be applied directly to devices while they are in storage.\n•If devices have been stored for more than two years under normal storage conditions, it is recommended\nthat you check the leads for ease of soldering prior to use.2018-05-07\nRev.7.0©2015-2018\nToshiba Electronic Devices & Storage Corporation \nTLP2745\n1015. 15. 15. 15.

#### Description:
The TLP2745 is a high-performance photocoupler that integrates a Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) infrared light-emitting diode (LED) and a high-gain, high-speed photodetector. It is designed to provide electrical isolation between input and output, making it suitable for applications requiring signal isolation and noise immunity. The device is housed in a compact SO6L package, which allows for efficient space utilization in electronic designs.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Intelligent Power Modules:** Used for signal isolation in power management systems.
- **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs):** Provides isolation and signal interfacing in industrial automation.
- **High-Speed Digital Interfacing:** Ideal for instrumentation and control devices where fast response times are critical.
- **Data Communication:** Facilitates safe data transmission in various electronic systems.

The TLP2745 is particularly beneficial in applications where energy efficiency is important, as it operates with low supply and input currents, contributing to overall energy savings in electronic devices.
