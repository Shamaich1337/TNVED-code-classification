\nThe EN6360QI is a synchronous, programmable buck power supply with integrated power MOSFET switches \nand integrated inductor. The switching supply uses voltage mode control and a low noise PWM topology. This \nprovides superior impedance matching to ICs proce ssed in sub 90nm process technologies. The nominal input \nvoltage range is 2.5 - 6.6 volts. The output voltage is programmed using an external resistor divider network. \nThe feedback control loop incorporates a type IV voltage mode control design.  Type IV vo ltage mode control \nmaximizes control loop bandwidth and maintains excellent phase margin to improve transient performance.  \nThe EN6360QI is designed to support u p to 8A continuous output current operation.  The operating switching \nfrequency is between 0.9MHz and 1.5MHz and enables the use of small -size input and output capacitors.  \n \nSoft StartPower \nGood \nLogic\nBandgap \nReferenceMUXCompensation \nNetworkThermal LimitUVLO\nCurrent LimitP-Drive\nN-Drive\nPLL/Sawtooth \nGenerator\nFQADJ\nENABLE\nSS\nAGNDPOK\nVSENSEVFBPGNDS_OUT\nNC(SW)PVIN\nTo PLL\nError \nAmpPWM \nComp\n(+)(-)(-)\n(+)Digital I/OS_IN\nM/S\nVDDB\nVOUT\nAVIN\nAVIN\nEN_PBReference \nVoltage \nSelectorEAOUT\nEAOUTMUX\nAVIN\nAVINBGNDEff\n94k\n24k24k\n06489                                                                                                                  October 16, 2019                                                                                                                Rev J\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6360QI  \nPage 17   The power supply has the following features:  \n• Precision Enable Threshold  \n• Soft -Start \n• Pre-bias Start-Up \n• Resistor Programmable Switching Frequency  \n• Phase -Lock F requency  Synchronization  \n• Parallel Operation  \n• Power OK  \n• Over -Current /Short Circuit P rotection  \n• Thermal Shutdown with Hysteresis  \n• Under -Voltage Lockout  \nPrecision Enable Operation  \nThe ENABLE  threshold is a precision analog voltage rath er than a digital logic threshold.  A precision voltage \nreference and a comparator circuit are kept powered up even when ENABLE  is de -asserted. The narrow voltage \ngap between ENABLE Logic Low and ENABLE Logic High allows the device to turn on at a precise e nable \nvoltage level. With the enable threshold pinpointed, a proper choice of soft -start capacitor helps to accurately \nsequence multiple power supplies in a system as desired.  There is an ENABLE lockout time of 2ms that \nprevents the device from re -enabling  immediately after it is disabled. See the Electrical Characteristics Table  \nfor technical specifications for the ENABLE  pin. \nSoft -Start Operation  \nThe SS pin in conjunction with a small external capacitor between this pin and AGND provides a soft -start \nfunction to limit in -rush current during device power -up. When the part is initially powered up, the output \nvoltage is gradually ramped to its final v alue. The gradual output ramp is achieved by increasing the reference \nvoltage to the error amplifier. A constant current flowing into the soft -start capacitor provides the reference \nvoltage ramp. When the voltage on the soft -start capacitor reaches 0.60V, the output has reached its \nprogrammed voltage. Once the output voltage has reached nominal voltage the soft -start capacitor will \ncontinue  to charge to  1.5V  (Typical) . The output rise time  can be controlled by the choice of soft -start capacitor \nvalue.   \nThe rise time is defined as the time from when the E NABLE  signal crosses the threshold and the input voltage \ncrosses the upper UVLO threshold to the time when the output voltage reaches 95% of the programmed value. \nThe rise  time  (tRISE) is given by the followi ng equation:   \ntRISE [ms] = C ss [nF] x 0.065  \nThe rise time (t RISE) is in milliseconds and the soft -start capacitor (C SS) is in nano -Farads. The soft -start capacitor \nshould be between 10nF and 100nF.  \nPre-Bias Start -up \nThe EN6360QI supports startup into a pre -biased load. A proprietary circuit ensures the output voltage rises \nup from the pre -bias value to the programmed output voltage. Start -up is guaranteed to be monotonic for \npre-bias voltages in the range of 20% to 75 % of the programmed output voltage with a minimum pre -bias \nvoltage of 300mV.  Outside of the 20% to 75% range, the output voltage rise will not be monotonic.

For this feature t o work properly, V IN \nmust be ramped up prior to ENABLE turning on the device. Tie VSENSE to VOUT if Pre -Bias is used. Tie EN_PB \nto ground and leave VSENSE floating to disable the Pre -Bias feature. Pre -Bias is supported for external clock \nsynchronization, b ut not supported for parallel operations.  \nResistor Programmable Frequency  \nThe operation of the EN6360QI can be optimized by a proper choice of the RFQADJ  resistor . The f requency can \nbe tuned to optimize dynamic performance and efficiency. Refer to Table 1 for recommended R FQADJ  values.  \nTable 1:  Recommended R FQADJ  (k\uf057) \n       VOUT \nVIN 0.8V  1.2V  1.5V  1.8V  2.5V  3.3V  \n3.3V \uf0b110%  3.57  3.57  4.99  5.49  5.49  NA \n5.0V \uf0b110%  3.57  3.57  4.99  5.49  5.49  4.99  \n6.0V \uf0b110%  3.57  3.57  4.99  5.49  5.49  5.49  \nPhase -Lock Operation  \nThe EN6360QI can be phase -locked to an external clock signal to synchronize its switching frequency. The \nM/S pin can be left floating or pulled to ground to allow the device to synchronize with an external clock signal \nusing the S_IN pin.  When a clock signal is present at S_IN, an activity detector recognizes the presence of the \nclock signal and the internal oscillator phase locks to the external clock. The external clock could be the system \nclock or the output of another EN6360QI . The phase lo cked clock is then output at S_OUT .

When \nthe M/S pin is in float state, parallel operati on is not possible. In Master  mode, a version of the  internal \nswitching PWM signal is output on the S_OUT pin. This PWM signal from the Master is fed to the Slave device \nat its S_IN pin. The Slave device acts like an extension of the power FETs in the Mast er and inherits the PWM \nfrequency and duty cycle . The inductor in the Slave prevents crow -bar currents from Master to Slave due to \ntiming delays . The Master device’s switching clock may be phase -locked to an external clock source or another \nEN6360QI  to mov e the entire parallel operation frequency away from sensitive frequencies .

The POK signal is asserted high when \nthe rising output voltage crosses 92% (nominal) of the programmed output voltage.  If the output voltage falls \noutside the range of 90% to 120% , POK remains asserted for  the de -glitch time (213µs at 1.2MHz) . After the \nde-glitch time, POK is de -asserted.  POK is  also  de-asserted if the output voltage exceeds 120% of the \nprogrammed output  voltage.  \nOver -Current Protection  (OCP)  \nThe current li mit function is achieved by sensing the current flowing through a sense P -FET. When \nthe sensed current exceeds the current limit, both power FETs are turned off for the rest of the \nswitching cycle. If the over -current condition is removed, the over -current  protection circuit will re -\nenable PWM operation. If the over -current condition persists, the circuit will continue to protect the \nload. The OCP trip point is nominally set as specified in the Electrical Characteristics table. In the \nevent the OCP circuit trips consistently in normal operation, the device enters a hiccup mode. The \ndevice is disabled for 27ms and restarted with a normal soft -start. This cycle can continue indefinitely \nas long as the over current condition persists.  \nThermal Protection  \nTempera ture sensing circuits in the controller will disable operation when the junction temperature exceeds \napproximately 150 °C. Once the junction  temperature drops by approx 20 °C, the converter will re -start with a \nnormal soft -start.  \nInput Under -Voltage Lock -Out (UVLO)  \nWhen the input voltage is below a required voltage level (V UVHI) for normal operation, the converter switching \nis inhibited. The lock -out threshold has hysteresis to prevent chatter. Thus when the device is operating \nnormally, the input voltage has  to fall below the lower threshold (V UVLO) for the device to stop switching.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n06489                                                                                                                  October 16, 2019                                                                                                                Rev J\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6360QI  \nPage 21   APPLICATION INFORMAT ION \nOutput Voltage  Programming and loop Compensation  \nThe EN6360QI output voltage is programmed using a simple resistor divider network. A phase lea d capacitor \nplus a resistor are required for stabilizing the loop. Figure 6  shows the required components and the equations \nto calculate their values.  \nThe EN6360QI output voltage is determined by the voltage presented at the VFB pin. This voltage is set by \nway of a resistor divider between VOUT and AGND with the midpoint going to VFB.  \nThe EN6360QI uses a type IV compensation network. Most of this networ k is integrated. However , a phase \nlead capacitor and a resistor are required in parallel with upper resistor of the external feedback network ( Refer \nto Figure 6 ). Total compensation is optimized for use with two 47μF output capacitance and will result in a  \nwide loop bandwidth and excellent load transient performance for most applications. Additional capacitance \nmay be placed beyond the voltage sensing point outside the control loop. Voltage mode operation provides \nhigh noise immunity at light load. Further more, voltage mode control provides superior impedance matching \nto ICs processed in sub 90nm technologies.  \nIn some cases modifications to the compensation or output capacitance may be required to optimize device \nperformance such as transient response, ripple, or hold -up time. The EN6360QI provides the capability to \nmodify the control loop response to allow for customization for such applications.

The Intel  Enpirion PowerSoC  helps alleviate some of those concerns.  \nThe Intel  Enpirion EN6360 QI DC -DC converter is packaged in a n 8x11x3mm 68-pin QFN package. The QFN \npackage is constructed with copper lead frames that have exposed thermal pads.  The exposed thermal pad \non the packa ge should be soldered directly on to a copper ground pad on the printed circuit board (PCB)  to \nact as a heat sink. The recommended maximum junction temperature for continuous operation is 125°C.  \nContinuous operation above 125°C may  reduce long -term reliabi lity. The device has a thermal overload \nprotec tion circuit designed to turn off the device at  an approximate junction temperature value of 150°C.   \nThe EN6360QI is guaranteed to support the full 8A output  current up to 85°C ambient temperature.

The θ JA parameter estimates how much the temperature will rise in the device for every watt of \npower dissipation. The EN6360 QI has a θ JA value of 1 5 ºC/W  without airflow.  \nDetermine the change in temperature (ΔT) based on P D and θ JA. \nΔT = P D x θ JA \nΔT ≈ 1.685W x 15°C/W = 25.28°C ≈ 25.3°C  \nThe junction temperature (T J) of the device is approximately the ambient temperature (T A) plus the change in \ntemperature. We assume the initial ambient temperature to be 25°C.  \nTJ = T A + ΔT  \nTJ ≈ 25°C + 25.3°C ≈ 50.3°C  \nWith 1.685W dissipated into the device, the T J will be 50.3°C.  \nThe maximum operating junction temperature (T JMAX) of the device is 125°C, so the device can operate at a \nhigher ambient temperature. The maximum ambient temperature (T AMAX) allowed can be calculated.  \nTAMAX = T JMAX – PD x θ JA \n          ≈ 125°C – 25.3°C ≈ 99.7°C  \nThe ambient temperature can actually rise by another 74.7°C, bringing it to 99.7°C before the device will reach \nTJMAX. This indicates that the EN6360QI can support the full 8A outp ut current range up to approximately \n99.7°C ambient temperature given the input and output voltage conditions. This allows the EN6360QI to \nguarantee full 8A output current capability at 85°C with room for margin. Note that the efficiency will be slightly \nlower at higher temperatures and this estimate will be slightly lower.  \n06489                                                                                                                  October 16, 2019                                                                                                                Rev J\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6360QI  \nPage 27   ENGINEERING SCHEMATI C \n  \nFigure 9: Engineering Schematic with Engineering Notes  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n06489                                                                                                                  October 16, 2019                                                                                                                Rev J\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6360QI  \nPage 28   LAYOUT RECOMMENDATION S \n \nFigure 10: Top Layout with Critical Components Only (Top View)  \nThis layout only shows the critical components and top layer traces for minimum footprint in single -supply \nmode with ENABLE tied to AVIN. Alternate circuit configurations & other low -power pins need to be connected \nand routed according to customer applicat ion. Please see the Gerber files at http://www.intel.com/enpirion  for \ndetails on all layers.  \nRecommendation 1 : Input and output filter capacitors should be placed on the same side of the PCB, and as \nclose to the EN6360QI package as possible. They should be connected to the device with very short and \nwide traces. Do not use thermal reliefs or spokes when connecting the capacitor pads to the respective \nnodes. T he +V and GND traces between the capacitors and the EN6360QI should be as close to each other \nas possible so that the gap between the two nodes is minimized, even under the capacitors.  \nRecommendation 2 : The PGND connections for the input and output capacit ors on layer 1 need to have a slit \nbetween them in order to provide some separation between input and output current loops.  \nRecommendation 3 : The system ground plane should be the first layer immediately below the surface layer. \nThis ground plane should be  continuous and un -interrupted below the converter and the input/output \ncapacitors.  \nRecommendation 4 : The thermal pad underneath the component must be connected to the system ground \nplane through as many vias as possible. The drill diameter of the vias sho uld be 0.33mm, and the vias must \nhave at least 1 oz. copper plating on the inside wall, making the finished hole size around 0.20 -0.26mm. Do \nnot use thermal reliefs or spokes to connect the vias to the ground plane. This connection provides the path \nfor he at dissipation from the converter.  \nRecommendation 5 : Multiple small vias (the same size as the thermal vias discussed in recommendation 4) \nshould be used to connect ground terminal of the input capacitor and output capacitors to the system ground \nplane. I t is preferred to put these vias along the edge of the GND copper closest to the +V copper. These vias \n06489                                                                                                                  October 16, 2019                                                                                                                Rev J\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6360QI  \nPage 29   connect the input/output filter capacitors to the GND plane, and help reduce parasitic inductances in the input \nand output current loops.   \nRecommendation  6: AVIN is the power supply for the small -signal control circuits. It should be connected to \nthe input voltage at a quiet point. In Figure 10  this connection is made at the input capacitor.  \nRecommendation 7: The layer 1 metal under the device must not be more than shown in Figure 10 . Refer to \nthe section regarding Exposed Metal on Bottom of Package. As with any switch -mode DC/DC converter, try \nnot to run sensitive signal or control lines underneath the converter package on other layers.   \nRecommendation 8: The V OUT sense point should be just after the last output filter capacitor. Keep the sense \ntrace short in order to avoid noise coupling into the node.  \nRecommendation 9: Keep R A, CA, RB, and R 1 close to the VFB pin ( Refer to Figure 10 ). Th e VFB pin is a high -\nimpedance, sensitive node. Keep the trace to this pin as short as possible. Whenever possible, connect R B \ndirectly to the AGND pin instead of going through the GND plane.  \nRecommendation 10: Follow all the layout recommendations as close  as possible to optimize performance. \nNot following layout recommendations can complicate designs and create anomalies different than the \nexpected operation of the product.  \n  \n06489                                                                                                                  October 16, 2019                                                                                                                Rev J\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6360QI  \nPage 30   DESIGN CONSIDERATION S FOR LEAD -FRAME BAS ED MODULES  \nExposed Metal on Bottom of Pac kage  \nLead -frames offer many advantages in thermal performance, in reduced electrical lead resistance, and in \noverall foot print. However, they do require some special considerations.  \nIn the assembly process lead frame construction requires that, for mechan ical support, some of the lead -frame \ncantilevers be exposed at the point where wire -bond or internal passives are attached. This results in several \nsmall pads being exposed on the bottom of the package, as shown in Figure 11.  \nOnly the thermal pad and the p erimeter pads are to be mechanically or electrically connected to the PC board. \nThe PCB top layer under the EN6360QI should be clear of any metal (copper pours, traces, or vias) except for \nthe thermal pad. The “shaded -out” area in Figure 11 represents the area that should be clear of any metal on \nthe top layer of the PCB. Any layer 1 metal under the shaded -out area runs the risk of undesirable shorted \nconnections even if it is covered by soldermask.  \nThe s older stencil aperture should be smaller than the PC B ground pad. This will prevent excess solder from \ncausing bridging between adjacent pins or other exposed metal under the  package. Please consult EN6360QI \nApplication Notes - Soldering Guidelines for more details and recommendations.   \n \nFigure 11: Lead -Frame exposed metal (Bottom View)  \nShaded  area highlights exposed metal that is not to be mechanically or electrically connected to the PCB.   \n06489                                                                                                                  October 16, 2019                                                                                                                Rev J\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6360QI  \nPage 31    \nFigure 12: EN6360QI PCB Footprint  (Top View)  \nThe solder stencil aperture for the thermal pad is shown in blue and is based on Enpirion power product manufacturing \nspecifications.   \n \n \n06489                                                                                                                  October 16, 2019                                                                                                                Rev J\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6360QI  \nPage 32   PACKAGE DIMENSIONS  \n \nFigure  13:  EN6360QI Package Dimensions  \nPacking and Marking Information : https://www.intel.com/support/quality -and-reliability/packing.html  \n \n  \n06489                                                                                                                  October 16, 2019                                                                                                                Rev J\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6360QI  \nWHERE TO GET MORE IN FORMATION  \nFor more information about Intel® and Enpirion® PowerSoCs, visit:  \nwww.intel.com/enpirion  \n \n© 2017  Intel Corporation.
