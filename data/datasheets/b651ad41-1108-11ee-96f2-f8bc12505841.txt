It is housed in a 16-lead, 3 mm × 3 mm, LFCSP  \npackage. The HMC903LP3E  amplifier operates from  6 GHz to  \n17 GHz, providing 18 .5 dB of small signal gain  and 1.7 dB noise  \nfigure  in the 6 GHz to 16 GHz band , and an output IP3 of 25  dBm  \nfull band 6 GHz to 17 GHz , while requiring only 80  mA from a \n3.5 V supply.  \n The P1dB output power of 14 .5 dBm enables the LNA to function \nas a local oscillator ( LO) driver for balanced, I/Q o r image reject \nmixers. The HMC903LP3E also features  an input  and an output \nthat are dc blocked and internally matched to 50  Ω, making it \nideal for high capacity microwave radios and video satellite \n(VSAT ) applications.  \n \n \n \n \n \nHMC903LP3E  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

I | Page 9  of 13 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe HMC903LP3E  is a gallium arsenide (GaAs), monolithic \nmicrowave  integr ated circuit (MMIC), pseudomorphic (pHEMT), \nlow noise amplifier. The HMC903LP3E amplifier uses two gain \nstages in series, and the basic schematic of the amplifier is shown in \nFigure 21, which forms a low noise amplifier operating from 6 GHz \nto 17 GHz with  excellent noise figure performance.  \nVDD1\nVGG1VDD2\nVGG2RFIN RFOUT\n14479-021 \nFigure 21. Basic Schematic of the Amplifier  \n \n \n The HMC903LP3E has single -ended input and output ports \nwhose impedances are nominally equal to 50 Ω over the 6 GHz \nto 17 GHz frequency range. Consequently, it can directly insert \ninto a 50 Ω system with no required impedance matching circuitry, which also means that multiple HMC903LP3E amplifiers can be casc aded back to back without the need for \nexternal matching circuitry.  \nThe input and output impedances are sufficiently stable vs. variations in temperature and supply voltage that no impedance matching compensation is required.  \nNote that it is critical to su pply very low inductance ground \nconnections to  the GND pins and to the package base exposed \npad to ensure stable operation. To achieve optimal performance from the HMC903LP3E and to preven t damage to the device, do \nnot exceed the absolute maximum ratings . \n \n \nHMC903LP3E  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. I | Page 10 of 13 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nFigure 22 shows the basic connections for operating the \nHMC903LP3E. Both the RFIN and RFOUT ports have on -chip \ndc block capacitors that eliminate the need for external ac  \ncoupling capacitors.  \nThe HMC903LP3E has VGG1 and VGG2 optional gate bias pins. \nWhen these pins are left open, the amplifier run s in self  biased \noperation  with a typical IDQ = 80 mA , when VDD1/VDD2 = 3.5 V . \nWhen using the VGG1 and VGG2 gate bias pins, follow the \nrecommended bias sequencing so that the amplifier is not  \ndamage d. \nRECOMMENDED BIAS SEQ UENCE DURING \nPOWER  UP \nThe recommended bias sequence to power up the \nHMC903LP3E is as follows:  \n1. Connect to GND . \n2. Set VGG1 and VGG2 to −2 V. \n3. Set VDD1 and VDD2 to 3.5 V . \n4. Increase VGG1 and VGG2 to achieve a typical IDQ = 80 mA . \n5. Apply the RF signal. RECOMMENDED BIAS SEQ UENCE DURING POWER \nDOWN  \nThe recommended bias sequence to power down the \nHMC903LP3E is as follows:  \n1. Turn off the  RF signal.  \n2. Decrease VGG1 and VGG2 to −2 V to achieve a typical IDQ = \n0 mA. \n3. Decrease VDD1 and VDD2 to 0 V . \n4. Increase VGG1 and VGG2 to 0 V . \nUnless otherwise noted, all measurements and data shown were \ntaken using the typical application circuit (see Figure 23), with \nthe evaluation board (see Figure 22) and biased per the conditions  \nin this section. The VDD1 and VDD2 pins are connected together;  \nsimilar ly, the VGG1 and VGG2 pins are also connected together. The \nbias conditions shown in this section are the operating points recommended to optimize the overall  performance. Operation \nusing o ther bias conditions may provide performance that differs \nfrom what is shown in this data sheet.  \nDecreasing the V\nDD1 and VDD2 level s has negligible effect on the \ngain and noise figure  perfo rmance ; however, they  reduce the \nP1dB. This behavior is  shown in  Figure 8 to Figure 20. Fo r \napplications where the P1dB requirement is not stringent, the \nHMC903LP3E can be down biased to reduce power \nconsumptio n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nData Sheet  HMC903LP3E  \n \nRev.

**Typical Applications:**
The HMC903LP3E is primarily used in:
- Point-to-point and point-to-multipoint radios
- Military and space communication systems
- Test instrumentation
- High-capacity microwave radios
- Video satellite (VSAT) applications

This amplifier is ideal for applications requiring low noise and high gain, making it suitable for use as a local oscillator (LO) driver for balanced, I/Q, or image reject mixers. Its design allows for easy integration into 50 Ω systems without the need for additional impedance matching circuitry, enhancing its versatility in RF applications.
