When \npower-down is initiated, SW3 is closed, and SW1 and SW2 are opened. This ensures that there is no loading of the REF\nIN pin \non power-down. \n04763-016BUFFERTO R COUNTER REFIN100k\uf057 NC\nSW2\nSW3\nNONC\nSW1POWER-DOWN\nCONTROL\n \nFigure 16. Reference Input Stage \nN COUNTER \nThe CMOS N counter allows a wide division ratio in the PLL \nfeedback counter. The counters are specified to work when the \nVCO output is 400 MHz or less. To avoid confusion, this is re-\nferred to as the B counter. It makes it possible to generate output \nfrequencies that are spaced only by the reference frequency divided by \nR. The VCO frequency equation is \nR f B fREFIN VCO /\uf0b4 \uf03d  \nwhere: \nfVCO is the output frequency of the VCO.  \nB is the preset divide ratio of the binary 13-bit counter (3 to 8191).  \nfREFIN is the external reference frequency oscillator. \nR COUNTER \nThe 14-bit R counter allows the input reference frequency to be divided down to produce the reference clock to the phase fre-\nquency detector (PFD). Division ratios from 1 to 16,383 are allowed. \nPFD AND CHARGE PUMP \nThe PFD takes inputs from the R counter and N counter  \n(N = BP + A)  and produces an output proportional to the phase \nand frequency difference between them. Figure 17 is a simpli-\nfied schematic. The PFD includes a programmable delay ele-ment that controls the width of the antibacklash pulse. This pulse ensures that there is no dead zone in the PFD transfer function, and minimizes phase noise and reference spurs. Two \nbits in the R counter latch, ABP2 and ABP1, control the width \nof the pulse (see Table 9). \n04763-017PROGRAMMABLE\nDELAYU3\nCLR2\nQ2 D2\nU2CLR1Q1 D1CHARGE\nPUMP\nDOWNUPHI\nHIU1\nABP1 ABP2\nR DIVIDER\nN DIVIDER\nCP OUTPU TR DIVIDER\nN DIVIDERCP\nCPGNDVP\n \nFigure 17.

When LDP in the R counter latch \nis set to 0, digital lock detect is set high when the phase error on \nthree consecutive phase detector cycles is less than 15 ns. \nWith LDP set to 1, five consecutive cycles of less than 15 ns \nphase error are required to set the lock detect. It stays set high \nuntil a phase error of greater than 25 ns is detected on any  \nsubsequent PD cycle. \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER \nThe digital section of the ADF4360-8 includes a 24-bit input \nshift register, a 14-bit R counter, and an 18-bit N counter  \ncomprised of a 5-bit A counter and a 13-bit B counter. Data is clocked into the 24-bit shift register on each rising edge of CLK. \nThe data is clocked in MSB first. Data is transferred from the \nshift register to one of four latches on the rising edge of LE. The destination latch is determined by the state of the two control bits (C2, C1) in the shift register. The two LSBs, DB1 and DB0, \nare shown in Figure 2. \nThe truth table for these bits is shown in Table 5. Table 6 shows \na summary of how the latches are programmed. Note that the \ntest modes latch is used for factory testing and should not be \nprogrammed by the user. \nTable 5.

Frequency vs. V TUNE , ADF4360-8, L1 and L2 = 270 nH \nThe R counter output is used as the clock for the band select  \nlogic and should not exceed 1 MHz. A programmable divider is \nprovided at the R counter input to allow division by 1, 2, 4, or 8, \nand is controlled by the BSC1 bit and the BSC2 bit in the R counter latch. Where the required PFD frequency exceeds 1 MHz, the divide ratio should be set to allow enough time for \ncorrect band selection. \nAfter band selection, normal PLL action resumes. The value of \nK\nV is determined by the value of inductors used (see the Choos-\ning the Correct Inductance Value section). The ADF4360-8  \ncontains linearization circuitry to minimize any variation of the \nproduct of I CP and K V. \nThe operating current in the VCO core is programmable in four steps: 2.5 mA, 5 mA, 7.5 mA, and 10 mA. This is controlled by the PC1 bit and the PC2 bit in the control latch. \n \n \n \n  \nADF4360-8 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 12 of 24 OUTPUT STAGE \nThe RF OUTA and RF OUTB pins of the ADF4360-8  are connected \nto the collectors of an NPN differential pair driven by buffered \noutputs of the VCO, as shown in Figure 20. To allow the user to optimize the power dissipation vs. the output power require-\nments, the tail current of the differential pair is programmable \nvia Bits PL1 and PL2 in the control latch. Four current levels may be set: 3.5 mA, 5 mA, 7.5 mA, and 11 mA. These levels give output power levels of −9 dBm, −6 dBm, −3 dBm, and 0 dBm, respectively, using the correct shunt inductor to V\nDD and ac \ncoupling into a 50 Ω load. Alternatively, both outputs can be \ncombined in a 1 + 1:1 transformer or a 180° microstrip coupler \n(see the Output Matching section). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If the outputs are used individually, the optimum output stage \nconsists of a shunt inductor to V\nDD. \nAnother feature of the ADF4360-8  is that the supply current  \nto the RF output stage is shut down until the device achieves lock, as measured by the digital lock detect circuitry. This is enabled by \nthe Mute-Till-Lock Detect (MTLD) bit in the control latch. \nVCORFOUTAR FOUTB\nBUFFER\n04763-020 \nFigure 20.

D | Page 17 of 24 POWER-UP \nPower-Up Sequence \nThe correct programming sequence for the ADF4360-8 after \npower-up is \n1. R counter latch \n2. Control latch \n3. N counter latch \nInitial Power-Up \nInitial power-up refers to programming the device after the  \napplication of voltage to the AV DD, DV DD, V VCO, and CE pins. On \ninitial power-up, an interval is required between programming \nthe control latch and programming the N counter latch. This interval is necessary to allow the transient behavior of the \nADF4360-8  during initial power-up to settle. \nDuring initial power-up, a write to the control latch powers up \nthe device, and the bias currents of the VCO begin to settle. If these currents have not settled to within 10% of their steady-\nstate value, and if the N counter latch is then programmed, the VCO may not oscillate at the desired frequency, which does not allow the band select logic to choose the correct frequency band, \nand the ADF4360-8  may not achieve lock. If the recommended \ninterval is inserted, and the N counter latch is programmed, the \nband select logic can choose the correct frequency band, and \nthe device locks to the correct frequency. \nThe duration of this interval is affected by the value of the  \ncapacitor on the C\nN pin (Pin 14). This capacitor is used to  \nreduce the close-in noise of the ADF4360-8  VCO. The  \nrecommended value of this capacitor is 10 μF. Using this value \nrequires an interval of ≥15 ms between the latching in of the \ncontrol latch bits and latching in of the N counter latch bits. If a \nshorter delay is required, the capacitor can be reduced. A slight phase noise penalty is incurred by this change, which is further \nexplained in Table 10. \nTable 10.

D | Page 18 of 24 Hardware Power-Up/Power-Down  \nIf the device is powered down via the hardware (using the CE \npin) and powered up again without any change to the N counter \nregister during power-down, the device locks at the correct \nfrequency, because the device is already in the correct frequency band. The lock time depends on the value of capacitance on the C\nN pin, which is <15 ms for 10 μF capacitance. The smaller  \ncapacitance of 440 nF on this pin enables lock times of <600 μs. \nThe N counter value cannot be changed while the device is in \npower-down, since the device may not lock to the correct  \nfrequency on power-up. If it is updated, the correct program-\nming sequence for the device after power-up is the R counter \nlatch, followed by the control latch, and finally the N counter latch, with the required interval between the control latch and \nN counter latch, as described in the Initial Power-Up section. \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Software Power-Up/Power-Down  \nIf the device is powered down via the software (using the con-\ntrol latch) and powered up again without any change to the N \ncounter latch during power-down, the device locks at the cor-\nrect frequency, because the device is already in the correct fre-quency band. The lock time depends on the value of capaci-tance on the C\nN pin, which is <15 ms for 10 μF capacitance. The \nsmaller capacitance of 440 nF on this pin enables lock times of <600 μs. \nThe N counter value cannot be changed while the device is in \npower-down, because the device may not lock to the correct  frequency on power-up. If it is updated, the correct program-\nming sequence for the device after power-up is to the R counter latch, followed by the control latch, and finally the N counter latch, with the required interval between the control latch and \nN counter latch, as described in the Initial Power-Up section. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nData Sheet ADF4360-8\n \nRev. D | Page 19 of 24 CONTROL LATCH \nWith (C2, C1) = (0, 0), the control latch is programmed. Table 7 \nshows the input data format for programming the control latch. \nPower-Down \nDB21 (PD2) and DB20 (PD1) provide programmable power-\ndown modes. \nIn the programmed asynchronous power-down, the device \npowers down immediately after latching a 1 into Bit PD1,  \nwith the condition that PD2 has been loaded with a 0. In the \nprogrammed synchronous power-down, the device power-down is gated by the charge pump to prevent unwanted  frequency jumps. Once the power-down is enabled by writing a 1 into Bit PD1 (on the condition that a 1 has also been loaded to PD2), the device goes into power-down on the second rising \nedge of the R counter output, after LE goes high. When the \nCE pin is low, the device is immediately disabled, regardless \nof the state of PD1 or PD2.  \nWhen a power-down is activated (either synchronous or \nasynchronous mode), the following events occur: \n\uf0b7 All active dc current paths are removed. \n\uf0b7 The R, N, and timeout counters are forced to their load state conditions. \n\uf0b7 The charge pump is forced into three-state mode. \n\uf0b7 The digital lock detect circuitry is reset. \n\uf0b7 The RF outputs are de-biased to a high impedance state. \n\uf0b7 The reference input buffer circuitry is disabled. \n\uf0b7 The input register remains active and capable of loading \nand latching data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Charge Pump Currents \nCPI3, CPI2, and CPI1 in the ADF4360-8  determine  \nCurrent Setting 1.  CPI6, CPI5, and CPI4 determine Current Setting 2. See the \ntruth table in Table 7. \nOutput Power Level \nBits PL1 and PL2 set the output power level of the VCO. See the truth table in Table 7. \nMute-Till-Lock Detect \nDB11 of the control latch in the ADF4360-8  is the Mute-Till-\nLock Detect bit. This function, when enabled, ensures that the \nRF outputs are not switched on until the PLL is locked. \nCP Gain \nDB10 of the control latch in the ADF4360-8  is the Charge \nPump Gain bit. When it is programmed to 1, Current Setting 2 is used. When programmed to 0, Current Setting 1 is used. \nCharge Pump Three-State \nThis bit puts the charge pump into three-state mode when  \nprogrammed to a 1. It should be set to 0 for normal operation. \nPhase Detector Polarity \nThe PDP bit in the ADF4360-8  sets the phase detector polarity. \nThe positive setting enabled by programming a 1 is used when using the on-chip VCO with a passive loop filter or with an \nactive non-inverting filter. It can also be set to 0, which is re-\nquired if an active inverting loop filter is used. \nMUXOUT Control \nThe on-chip multiplexer is controlled by M3, M2, and M1. See the truth table in Table 7. \nCounter Reset \nDB4 is the counter reset bit for the ADF4360-8 . When this is 1, \nthe R counter and the A, B counters are reset. For normal oper-ation, this bit should be 0. \nCore Power Level \nPC1 and PC2 set the power level in the VCO core. The recom-\nmended setting is 5 mA. See the truth table in Table 7. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nADF4360-8 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 20 of 24 N COUNTER LATCH \nTable 8 shows the input data format for programming the  \nN counter latch. \nReserved Bits \nDB2 to DB7 are spare bits and have been designated as  \nreserved. They should be programmed to 0. \nB Counter Latch \nB13 to B1 program the B counter. The divide range is 3 \n(00...0011) to 8191 (11...111). \nOverall Divide Range \nThe overall VCO feedback divide range is defined by B. \nCP Gain \nDB21 of the N counter latch in the ADF4360-8  is the charge \npump gain bit. When it is programmed to 1, Current Setting 2 is used. When programmed to 0, Current Setting 1 is used. This bit can also be programmed through DB10 of the control latch. The bit always reflects the latest value written to it, whether this is through the control latch or the N counter latch. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n R COUNTER LATCH \nWith (C2, C1) = (0, 1), the R counter latch is programmed. \nTable 9 shows the input data format for programming the  \nR counter latch. \nR Counter \nR1 to R14 set the counter divide ratio. The divide range is  \n1 (00...001) to 16383 (111...111). \nAntibacklash Pulse Width \nDB16 and DB17 set the antibacklash pulse width. \nLock Detect Precision \nDB18 is the lock detect precision bit. This bit sets the number of \nreference cycles with less than 15 ns phase error for entering the \nlocked state. With LDP at 1, five cycles are taken; with LDP at 0, \nthree cycles are taken. \nTest Mode Bit \nDB19 is the test mode bit (TMB) and should be set to 0. With \nTMB = 0, the contents of the test mode latch are ignored and \nnormal operation occurs, as determined by the contents of the \ncontrol latch, R counter latch, and N counter latch. Note that test modes are for factory testing only and should not be  \nprogrammed by the user. \nBand Select Clock \nThese bits set a divider for the band select logic clock input.  \nThe output of the R counter is, by default, the value used to \nclock the band select logic; if this value is too high (>1 MHz), a divider can be switched on to divide the R counter output to a \nsmaller value (see Table 9). \nReserved Bits \nDB23 to DB22 are spare bits that have been designated as  \nreserved. They should be programmed to 0. \n \n \nData Sheet ADF4360-8\n \nRev.

Figure 22 shows a graph of both minimum and maximum frequency vs. the external inductor value. The \ncorrect inductor should cover the maximum and minimum \nfrequencies desired. The inductors used are 0603 CS or 0805 CS type from Coilcraft. To reduce mutual coupling, the inductors \nshould be placed at right angles to one another. \nThe lowest center frequency of oscillation possible is approxi-\nmately 65 MHz, which is achieved using 560 nH inductors.

Output Center Frequency vs. External Inductor Value \nThe approximate value of capacitance at the midpoint of the \ncenter band of the VCO is 9.3 pF, and the approximate value of \ninternal inductance due to the bond wires is 0.9 nH. The VCO sensitivity is a measure of the frequency change vs. the tuning \nvoltage. It is a very important parameter for the low-pass filter. \nFigure 23 shows a graph of the tuning sensitivity (in MHz/V) vs. the inductance (nH). It can be seen that as the inductance increases, the sensitivity decreases. This relationship can be derived from the equation above; that is, since the inductance has increased, the change in capacitance from the varactor has less of an effect on the frequency. 04\n210\n8\n612\n0 100 200 300 400 600 500\nINDUCTANCE (nH)SENSITIVITY (MHz/V)\n04763-026\n \nFigure 23.

The low-pass filter was designed using ADIsimPLL  \nfor a channel spacing of 2 MHz and an open-loop bandwidth of \n100 kHz. The maximum PFD frequency of the ADF4360-8  is \n8 MHz. Since using a larger PFD frequency allows the use of a \nsmaller N, the in-band phase noise is reduced to as low as pos-sible, −109 dBc/Hz. The typical rms phase noise (100 Hz to 100 kHz) of the LO in this configuration is 0.09°. The reference frequency is from a 16 MHz TCXO from Fox; thus, an R value of \n2 is programmed. Taking into account the high PFD frequency \nand its effect on the band select logic, the band select clock  divider is enabled. In this case, a value of 8 is chosen. A very  simple shunt inductor and dc-blocking capacitor complete the RF \noutput stage. \nSPI-COMPATIBLE SERIAL BUSADF4360-8VVCOVVCO\nFOX\n801BE-160\n16MHz\nVVCO\nCPGND AGND DGND L1 L2 RFOUTBRFOUTACP\n1nF47pF\n68nH 470\uf05768nH\n470\uf05722nF\n56nH 56nH680pF\n51\uf057\n100pF100pF1nF 1nF10\uf06dF\n4.7k\uf0576.8k\uf05715k\uf057\nRSETCCLEDATACLKREFINCNVTUNE DVDDAVDDCE MUXOUT\n5424720 23 2 21 6\n14\n16\n17\n18\n19\n13\n1 3 8 910 1122 1512VVDDLOCK\nDETECT\n04763-027 \nFigure 24. Fixed Frequency LO \n \nADF4360-8 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 22 of 24 INTERFACING \nThe ADF4360-8  has a simple SPI-compatible serial interface for \nwriting to the device. CLK, DATA, and LE control the data \ntransfer. When LE goes high, the 24 bits that have been clocked into the appropriate register on each rising edge of CLK are \ntransferred to the appropriate latch. See Figure 2 for the timing \ndiagram and Table 5 for the latch truth table.  \nThe maximum allowable serial clock rate is 20 MHz. This \nmeans that the maximum update rate possible is 833 kHz, or \none update every 1.2 μs. This is more than adequate for systems \nthat have typical lock times in hundreds of microseconds. \nADuC812 Interface \nFigure 25 shows the interface between the ADF4360-8  and the \nADuC812 MicroConverter®. Since the ADuC812  is based on an \n8051 core, this interface can be used with any 8051-based mi-\ncrocontrollers. The MicroConverter is set up for SPI master mode with CPHA = 0. To initiate the operation, the I/O port driving LE is brought low. Each latch of the ADF4360-8 needs a 24-bit word, which is accomplished by writing three 8-bit bytes from the MicroConverter to the device. After the third byte has \nbeen written, the LE input should be brought high to complete \nthe transfer. \n04763-028ADuC812 ADF4360-8SCLK\nSDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)SCLOCK\nMOSI\nI/O PORTS\n \nFigure 25. ADuC812  to ADF4360-8  Interface \nI/O port lines on the ADuC812  are also used to control power-\ndown (CE input) and detect lock (MUXOUT configured as lock \ndetect and polled by the port input). When operating in the described mode, the maximum SCLOCK rate of the ADuC812 \nis 4 MHz. This means that the maximum rate at which the  output frequency can be changed is 166 kHz. \n \n \n \n \n \n  ADSP-2181 Interface \nFigure 26 shows the interface between the ADF4360-8  and the \nADSP-2181 digital signal processor. The ADF4360-8  needs a \n24-bit serial word for each latch write. The easiest way to ac-\ncomplish this using the ADSP-2181 is to use the autobuffered \ntransmit mode of operation with alternate framing. This pro-vides a means for transmitting an entire block of serial data \nbefore an interrupt is generated. \n04763-029ADSP-2181ADF4360-8SCLK\nSDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)SCLOCK\nMOSI\nTFS\nI/O PORTS\n \nFigure 26.

To program each 24-bit latch, store \nthe 8-bit bytes, enable the autobuffered mode, and write to the \ntransmit register of the DSP . This last operation initiates the \nautobuffer transfer. \nPCB DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR CHIP SCALE PACKAGE \nThe leads on the chip scale package (CP-24) are rectangular. \nThe printed circuit board pad for these should be 0.1 mm long-\ner than the package lead length and 0.05 mm wider than the package lead width. The lead should be centered on the pad to ensure that the solder joint size is maximized.  \nThe bottom of the chip scale package has a central thermal pad. \nThe thermal pad on the printed circuit board should be at least \nas large as this exposed pad. On the printed circuit board, there \nshould be a clearance of at least 0.25 mm between the thermal \npad and the inner edges of the pad pattern to ensure that short-\ning is avoided.  \nThermal vias may be used on the printed circuit board thermal \npad to improve thermal performance of the package. If vias  \nare used, they should be incorporated into the thermal pad at 1.2 mm pitch grid. The via diameter should be between 0.3 mm and 0.33 mm, and the via barrel should be plated with 1 ounce \nof copper to plug the via.  \nThe user should connect the printed circuit thermal pad to \nAGND. This is internally connected to AGND. \n  \n \nData Sheet ADF4360- 8 \n \nRev. D | Page 23 of 24 OUTPUT MATCHING  \nThere are a number of ways to match the output of the \nADF4360- 8 for optimum operation; the most basic is to use a \n50 Ω resistor to V VCO. A dc bypass capacitor of 100 pF is  \nconnected in series , as shown in Figure 27. Because the resi stor \nis not frequency dependent, this provides a good broa dband \nmatch. The output power in the c ircuit below typically gives  \n−9 dBm ou tput power into a 50 Ω load.  \n100pF\n04763-030RFOUTVVCO\n50Ω51Ω\n \nFigure 27. Simple ADF4360 -8 Output Stage  \nA better solution is to use a shunt inductor (acting as an RF \nchoke) to V VCO. This gives a better match and, therefore, more \noutput power.  \nExperiments have shown that the circuit shown in Figure 28 \nprovides an e xcellent match to 50 Ω over the  operating range of \nthe ADF4360- 8.
