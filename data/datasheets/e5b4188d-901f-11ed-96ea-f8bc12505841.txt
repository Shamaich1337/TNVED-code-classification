General Description\nThe Cypress S34ML01G1,\n S34ML02G1, and \nS34ML04G1 series is offer\ned with a 3.3-V V\nCC\n power supply, and \nwith ×8 or ×16 I/O \ninterface. Its NAND cell provides the most cost-effective solut\nion for the solid state mass storage market. The memory is divi\nded into \nblocks that can be erased independently so it is possible to pr\neserve valid data while old dat\na is erased. The page size for ×\n8 is \n(2048 + 64 spare) bytes; f\nor ×16 (1024 + 32) words.\nEach block can be programmed and \nerased up to 100,000 cycles wi\nth ECC (error correction code) \non. To extend t\nhe lifetime of \nNAND flash devices, the implem\nentation of an ECC is mandatory.\nThe chip supports CE# don\'t care function. This function allows\n the direct download of the code from the NAND flash memory dev\nice \nby a microcontroller, since the \nCE# transitions \ndo not stop the\n read operation.\nThe devices have a Read Cache f\neature that improves the read th\nroughput for large files. During \ncache reading, the devices loa\nd \nthe data in a cache r\negister while the previous data is transfe\nrred to the I/O buffers to be read.\nLike all other 2-kB \npage NAND flash devices, a program operatio\nn typically writes 2112 bytes \n(×8), or 1056 words (×16) in 200 \nµs \nand an erase operatio\nn can typically be performed in 2 ms (S34M\nL01G1) on a 128-kB block (×8)\n or 64-kword block (×16). In \naddition, thanks to multiplane ar\nchitecture, it is\n possible to \nprogram two pages at a time (one \nper plane) or to erase two blo\ncks at a \ntime (again, one per plane). The multiplane architecture allows\n program time to be reduced by 40% and erase time to be reduced\n by \n50%.\nIn multiplane operations, data in the page can be read out at 2\n5 ns cycle time per byte. The I\n/O pins serve as the ports for c\nommand \nand address input as well as data \ninput/output. This interface \nallows a reduced pin count and ea\nsy migration towards different\n \ndensities, without any rearra\nngement of the footprint.\nCommands, Data, and Addresses \nare asynchronously introduced usi\nng CE#, WE#, ALE, and CLE control pins.\nThe on-chip Program/Erase Contro\nller automates all read, progra\nm, and erase functions including \npulse repetition, where requir\ned, \nand internal verificat\nion and margining of d\nata. A WP# pin is a\nvailable to provide hardware pr\notection against p\nrogram and era\nse \noperations. \nThe output pin R/B# (open drain buffer) signals the status of t\nhe device during each operation. I\nt identifies if the program/e\nrase/read \ncontroller is currently active.\n The use of an \nopen-drain output\n allows the Ready/Busy pins from \nseveral memories\n to connect to\n a \nsingle pull-up resisto\nr. In a system w\nith multiple m\nemories the\n \nR/B# pins can be connected all t\nogether to provide a global sta\ntus signal.\nThe Reprogram function allows the\n optimization of defective blo\nck management — when a Page Progr\nam operation fails the data \ncan be directly programmed in \nanother page inside the same arra\ny section without the time consu\nming serial data insertion phas\ne. \nThe Copy Back operation automatically executes embedded error d\netection operation: 1-bit error out of every 528 bytes (×8) or \n256 \nwords (×16) can be detected. Wit\nh this feature it is no longer \nnecessary to use an external mechanism to detect Copy Back \noperation errors.\nMultiplane Copy Back is also suppo\nrted. Data read out after Cop\ny Back Read (both for\n single and multiplane cases) is allowed.\nIn addition, Cache Program and \nMultiplane Cache Program operati\nons improve the pr\nograming throughput b\ny programing data \nusing the cache register.\nThe devices provide two innovative features: Page Reprogram and\n Multiplane Page Reprogram. The Page Reprogram re-programs \none page. Normally, this operation\n is performed after a failed \nPage Program operation. Similarly\n, the Multiplane Page Reprogra\nm \nre-programs two pages in paralle\nl, one per plane. The first pag\ne must be in the first plane whi\nle the second page must be in t\nhe \nsecond plane. The Multiplane Page Reprogram operation is perfor\nmed after a failed Multiplane Page Program operation. The Page \nReprogram and Multiplane Page Rep\nrogram guarantee improved perf\normance, since data insertion can be omitted during \nre-program operations.\nNote\n: The S34ML01G1 device does not support EDC.\nDocument Number: 002-00676 Rev. *W\n                  \nPage 4 of 70 \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n                                                           \n                                     \nS34ML01G1\nS34ML02G1\nS34ML04G1\nThe devices come with an OTP (on\ne time programmable) area, whic\nh is a restricted access area w\nhere sensitive da\nta/code can be \nstored permanently.

Bus Operation\nThere are six standard bus operations that control the device: \nCommand Input, Address Input, D\nata Input, Data Output, Write \nProtect, and Standby. (See \nTable 7\n.)\nTypically glitches less than 5 \nns on Chip Enable, Write Enable,\n and Read Enable are ignored by t\nhe memory and do \nnot affect bu\ns \noperations.\n2.1 Command Input\nThe Command Input bus operation is\n used to give a command to th\ne memory device. Commands ar\ne accepted with Chip Enable \nlow, Command Latch Enable high, Address Latch Enable low, and R\nead Enable high and latched on the rising edge of Write Enable.\n \nMoreover, for commands\n that start a modify\n operation (program/e\nrase) the Write Protect p\nin must be high. See \nFigure 12 \non page 38\n and \nTable 20 on page 35\n for details of the timing requirements. Command codes are alwa\nys applied on I/O7:0 \nregardless of the bus configuration (×8 or ×16).\n2.2 Address Input\nThe Address Input bus operation a\nllows the insert\nion of the mem\nory address. For the S34ML02G1 \nand S34ML04G1 devices, five \nwrite cycles are needed to input t\nhe addresses. For the S34ML01\nG1, four write cycles are need\ned to input the addresses. If \nnecessary, a 5th dummy address \ncycle can be issu\ned to S34ML01G1\n, which will be ignored by t\nhe NAND device without causing \nproblems. Addresses ar\ne accepted with Chip Enable low, Address \nLatch Enable high, Command \nLatch Enable low, and Read \nEnable high and latched on the rising edge of Write Enable. Mor\neover, for commands that start a m\nodify operation (program/eras\ne) \nthe Write Protect pi\nn must be high. See \nFigure 13 on page 38\n and \nTable 20 on page 35\n for details of the timing requirements. \nAddresses are always applied on\n I/O7:0 regardless of the bus co\nnfiguration (×8 \nor ×16). Refer to \nTable 4\n through \nTable 6 \non page 11\n for more detail\ned information.\n2.3 Data Input\nThe Data Input bus operation allo\nws the data to be programmed t\no be sent to the device. The dat\na insertion is serial and timed\n by \nthe Write Enable cycles. Data \nis accepted only with Chip Enable\n low, Address Latch Enable low, C\nommand Latch Enable low, Read \nEnable high, and Write Protect h\nigh and latched on the rising e\ndge of Write Enable. See \nFigure 14 on page 39\n and \nTable 20 \non page 35\n for details of the timing requirements.\n2.4 Data Output\nThe Data Output bus operation a\nllows data to be read from the m\nemory array and to check the St\natus Register content, the EDC \nregister content, and the ID dat\na. Data can be serially shifted\n out by toggling the Read Enable\n pin with Chip Enable low, Writ\ne \nEnable high, Address Latch Enab\nle low, and Command Latch Enable\n low. See \nFigure 15 on page 39\n and \nTable 20 on page 35\n for \ndetails of the timi\nngs requirements.\n2.5 Write Protect\nThe Hardware Write Protection is activated when the Write Prote\nct pin is low. In this conditi\non, modify operations do not star\nt and the \ncontent of the memory is not alt\nered.

Two types of operatio\nns are available: random read \nand serial page read. Random re\nad mode is enabled when the \npage address is changed. All dat\na within the selected page are \ntransferred to the data register\ns. The system controller may de\ntect \nthe completion of thi\ns data transfer (t\nR\n) by analyzing the output of the \nR/B pin. Once the data in a pa\nge is loaded into the data \nregisters, they may be read out i\nn 25 ns cycle ti\nme by sequenti\nally pulsing RE#. The repetitive \nhigh to low transitions of the\n RE# \nsignal makes the devic\ne output the data, s\ntarting from the sele\ncted column address up to \nthe last column address.\nThe device may output random data \nin a page instead of the sequ\nential data by writing Random Data Output command. The column \naddress of next data, which is going to be out, may be changed \nto the address that follows Ra\nndom Data Output command. Random \nData Output can be performe\nd as many times as needed.\nAfter power up, the device is i\nn read mode, so \n00h command cycl\ne is not necessary to start a re\nad operation. Any operation oth\ner \nthan read or Random Data Outpu\nt causes the device to exit read \nmode. See \nFigure 6.1 on page 40\n and \nFigure 21 on page 43\n as \nreferences.\n3.2 Page Program\nA page program cycle consists of \na serial data loading period i\nn which up to 2112 byte\ns (×8) or 1056 words \n(×16) of d\nata may b\ne \nloaded into the data register, fo\nllowed by a non-volatile progr\namming period where \nthe loaded data is \nprogrammed into the \nappropriate cell.\nThe serial data loading period b\negins by inputting the Serial D\nata Input command (80h), followed\n by the five cycle address inp\nuts \n(four cycles for S34ML01G1) and t\nhen serial data. The words oth\ner than those to be \nprogrammed do not need to be loaded. The \ndevice supports Random Data Input\n within a page. The column add\nress of next data, wh\nich will be entered, m\nay be changed to the\n \naddress that follows the Random\n Data Input command (85h). Rando\nm Data Input may be performed \nas many times as needed.\nThe Page Program confirm command\n (10h) initiates the programmin\ng process. The internal write s\ntate controller automatically \nexecutes the algorithms and controls timings necessary for prog\nram and verify, thereby freeing \nthe system contr\noller for other\n tasks.\nOnce the program process starts, the Read Status Register comma\nnds (70h or 78h) may be issued to read the Status Register. The\n \nsystem controller can detect the\n completion of a\n program cycle \nby monitoring the \nR/B# output, or the Status bit\n (I/O6) of the Status Register. O\nnly the Read Status commands (7\n0h or 78h) or Reset command are \nvalid while programming is in \nprogress. When the Page Program i\ns complete, the Write\n Status Bit (I/O0) may be checked. The \ninternal write verify detects on\nly errors for 1’s that are not \nsuccessfully programmed to 0’s. \nThe command register remains in\n Read \nStatus command mode un\ntil another valid command is written to t\nhe command register. \nF i g u r e6 . 2  o np a g e4 2\n and \nFigure 20 \non page 43\n detail the sequence.\nThe device is programmable by page, but it also allows multiple\n partial page programming of a word or consecutive bytes up to \n2112 \nbytes (×8) or 1056 wo\nrds (×16) in a singl\ne page program cycle.\nThe number of consec\nutive partial page pr\nogramming operations (\nNOP) within the same page \nmust not exceed the number \nindicated in \nTable 23 on page 37\n. Pages may be programmed in\n any order within a block.\nUsers who use “EDC check” (for S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1 only) in\n copy back must comply with some\n limitations related to data \nhandling during one page pr\nogram sequence. Refer to \nSection 3.8 on page 19\n for details.\nIf a Page Program operation is i\nnterrupted by hardware reset, p\nower failure or other means,\n the host must ensure that the \ninterrupted page is not\n used for further read\ning or programming\n operations until the \nnext uninterrupted bl\nock erase is complet\ne.\nDocument Number: 002-00676 Rev. *W\n                  \nPage 15 of 70 \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n                                                           \n                                    \nS34ML01G1\nS34ML02G1\nS34ML04G1\n3.3 Multiplane Program — S\n34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nThe S34ML02G1 and S34M\nL04G1 devices support \nMultiplane Program,\n making it possible to program\n two pages in parallel, one \npage per plane.\nA Multiplane Program cycle consis\nts of a double serial data loa\nding period in which up to 4224 \nbytes (×8) or 2112 words (×16) \nof \ndata may be loaded into the data register, followed by a non-vo\nlatile programming period where the loaded data is programmed i\nnto \nthe appropriate cell.\n The serial data loading period begins wit\nh inputting the Serial Data Inpu\nt command (80h), followed by th\ne five \ncycle address inputs and serial \ndata for the 1s\nt page. T\nhe addr\ness for this page mus\nt be in the 1st plane \n(PLA0 = 0). The devi\nce \nsupports Random Data Input exactl\ny the same as in the case of p\nage program operation. The \nDummy Page Program Confirm \ncommand (11h) stops 1st page dat\na input and the device becomes \nbusy for a short time (t\nDBSY\n). Once it has beco\nme ready again, \nthe ‘81h’ command mus\nt be issued, followed by 2nd page address \n(5 cycles) and its serial data \ninput. The address for this page\n \nmust be in the 2nd plane (PLA0 =\n 1). The Program Confirm comman\nd (10h) starts parallel pr\nogramming of both pages. \nFigure 22 on page 44\n describes the sequences using\n the legacy protocol. In this cas\ne, the block address bits for the first plane are \nall zero and the second address\n issued selects the block for bo\nth planes. \nFigure 23 on page 44\n describes the sequences using the \nONFI protocol. For both addresse\ns issued in this\n protocol, the \nblock address bits must be the s\name except for the bit(s) that \nselect \nthe plane.\nThe user can check operation status by monitoring R/B# pin or r\neading the Status Register (comm\nand 70h or 78h). The Read Statu\ns \nRegister command is also availa\nble during Dummy Busy time (t\nDBSY\n). In case of failure in either\n page program, the fail bit of t\nhe \nStatus Register will \nbe set. Refer to \nSection 3.9 on page 21\n for further info.\nThe number of consec\nutive partial page pr\nogramming operations (\nNOP) within the same page \nmust not exceed the number \nindicated in \nTable 23 on page 37\n. Pages may be programmed in\n any order within a block.\nIf a Multiplane Program operatio\nn is interrupted \nby hardware re\nset, power failure or other means,\n the host must ensure that th\ne \ninterrupted pages are not used for further reading or programmi\nng operations until the next uninterrupted block erases are com\nplete \nfor the applicable blocks.\n3.4 Page Reprogram — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nPage Program may result in a fail, which can be detected by Rea\nd Status Register. In this event, the host may call Page Reprog\nram. \nThis command allows the reprogramm\ning of the same pattern of th\ne last (failed) page in\nto another memory location. The command \nsequence initiates with reprog\nram setup (8Bh),\n followed by the \nfive cycle address inputs of the\n target page. If the target pat\ntern for \nthe destination page \nis not changed compared\n to the last page, \nthe program confirm c\nan be issued (10h) wi\nthout any data input \ncycle, as described in \nFigure 8\n.\nFigure 8.

Page Reprogram with Data Manipulation\nThe device supports Random Data Input within a page. The column\n address of next data, which will be entered, may be changed to\n \nthe address which follows the \nRandom Data Input \ncommand (85h). \nRandom Data Input may be operat\ned multiple times regardless \nof how many times it\n is done in a page.\nThe Program Confirm command (10\nh) initiates the re-programming \nprocess. The internal write sta\nte controller automatically \nexecutes the algorithms and contro\nls timings necessary for prog\nram and verify, thereby freeing \nthe system controller for other\n tasks. \nOnce the program process starts\n, the Read Status Register comma\nnd may be issued to read the\n Status Register. The system \ncontroller can detect the comple\ntion of a program cycle by moni\ntoring the R/B# output, or the Status bit (I/O6) of the Status \nRegister. \nOnly the Read Status command an\nd Reset command are valid when p\nrogramming is in progress. When the Page Program is \ncomplete, the Write Status Bit (\nI/O0) may be checked. The inter\nnal write verify detects only err\nors for 1’s that are not succe\nssfully \nprogrammed to 0’s. The command reg\nister remains in Read Status \ncommand mode until anoth\ner valid command i\ns written to the \ncommand register.\nThe Page Reprogram must be issued in the same plane as the Page\n Program that failed.\n In order to program the data to a differe\nnt \nplane, use the Page Program oper\nation instead. The Multiplane P\nage Reprogram can re-program two\n pages in parallel, one per \nplane. The Multiplane \nPage Reprogram operation is performed aft\ner a failed Multiplane Page Pr\nogram operation. The command \nsequence is very similar to \nFigure 22 on page 44\n, except that it requir\nes the Page Reprogram Command (8Bh) inst\nead of 80h and \n81h.\nIf a Page Reprogram operation is\n interrupted by hardware reset,\n power failure or other means, t\nhe host must ensure that the \ninterrupted page is not\n used for further read\ning or programming\n operations until the \nnext uninterrupted bl\nock erase is complet\ne.\nC1\nIOx\nSR[6]\nSR[6]\nCycle Type\nI/Ox\nCycle Type\nAs defined for Page\nrogram\nP\nA\nA\nADDR\nADDR\nADDR\nADDR\nCMD\nR3\nR1\nC2\n80h\nPage N\nDin\nDin\nDin\nDin\nCMD\nD0\nD1\n. . .\nDn\n10h\nADDR\nADDR\nADDR\nADDR\nCMD\nR3\nR1\nC2\nC1\n8Bh\nFAIL !\nPage M\nCMD\n10h\ntADL\ntWB\ntPROG\ntWB\ntPROG\nCMD\nDout\n70h\nE1\nDin\nDin\nDin\nDin\nD0\nD1\n. . .\nDn\ntADL\nADDR\nR2\nADDR\nR2\nDocument Number: 002-00676 Rev. *W\n                  \nPage 17 of 70 \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n                                                           \n                                     \nS34ML01G1\nS34ML02G1\nS34ML04G1\n3.5 Block Erase\nThe Block Erase opera\ntion is done on a bloc\nk basis. Block addre\nss loading is accomplished in thr\nee cycles (two cycles for \nS34ML01G1) initiated by an Erase\n Setup command (60h). Only the \nblock address bits are valid wh\nile the page address bits are \nignored.\nThe Erase Confirm command (D0h) \nfollowing the block address loa\nding initiates the internal e\nrasing process. This two-step \nsequence of setup followed by t\nhe execution comm\nand ensures tha\nt memory contents are not acci\ndentally erased due to external \nnoise conditions.\nAt the rising edge of WE# after the erase confirm command input\n, the internal write controller handles erase and erase verify.\n Once \nthe erase process star\nts, the Read Status Re\ngister commands (70\nh or 78h) may be i\nssued to read the S\ntatus Register.\nThe system controller \ncan detect the comple\ntion of an erase by \nmonitoring the R/B# output, or t\nhe Status bit (I/\nO6) of the Sta\ntus \nRegister. Only the Read Status commands (70h or 78h) and Reset \ncommand are valid while erasing is in progress. When the erase \noperation is completed, the Write\n Status Bit (I/O0) may be chec\nked. \nFigure 24 on page 45\n details the sequence.\nIf a Block Erase operation is int\nerrupted by hardware reset, po\nwer failure or other means, the \nhost must ensure that the inter\nrupted \nblock is erased under continuous \npower conditions before that b\nlock can be trusted for further programming and reading operati\nons.\n3.6 Multiplane Block Erase —\n S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nMultiplane Block \nErase allows the erase \nof two blocks \nin parall\nel, one block per memory plane.\nThe Block erase setup command (\n60h) must be repeated two times,\n followed by 1st and \n2nd block address resp\nectively (3 cycles \neach). As for block erase, D0h\n command makes embedded operation\n start. In this case, multip\nlane erase does not need any \nDummy Busy Time between 1st \nand 2nd block insertion. See \nTable 23 on page 37\n for performance information. \nFor the Multiplane Block Erase \noperation, the address of the fi\nrst block must be within the firs\nt plane (PLA0 = 0) and the add\nress of \nthe second block in the second plane (PLA0 = 1). See \nFigure 25 on page 45\n for a description of the legacy protocol. In this case, the \nblock address bits for the first \nplane are all zero and the sec\nond address issued selects t\nhe block for both planes. \nFigure 26 \non page 46\n describes the sequences using t\nhe ONFI protocol. For both addr\nesses issued in this protocol, the block address bits \nmust be the same exc\nept for the bit(s) that select the plane.\nThe user can check operation status by monitoring R/B# pin or r\neading the Status Register (comm\nand 70h or 78h). The Read Statu\ns \nRegister command is also availa\nble during Dummy Busy time (t\nDBSY\n). In case of failure i\nn either erase, the fail bit of the Stat\nus \nRegister will be set. Refer to \nSection 3.9 on page 21\n for further information.\nIf a Multiplane Block Erase oper\nation is interru\npted by hardwar\ne reset, power failure or other\n means, the host must ensure tha\nt the \ninterrupted blocks are erased und\ner continuous power conditions\n before thos\ne blocks can be trusted fo\nr further programming and\n \nreading operations.\n3.7 Copy Back Program\nThe copy back featur\ne is intended to quickl\ny and efficiently re\nwrite data stored in \none page without utilizing an external mem\nory. \nSince the time-consuming cycles\n of serial access and re-loading\n cycles are removed, the system \nperformance is greatly improved\n. \nThe benefit is especially obvious when a portion of a block nee\nds to be updated and the rest of the block also needs to be cop\nied to \nthe newly assigned free block. The \noperation for performing a c\nopy back is a sequential execut\nion of page-read (without mandat\nory \nserial access) and Copy Back Progr\nam with the add\nress of destin\nation page. A read operation with the ‘35h’ command and the \naddress of the source page moves the whole page of data into th\ne internal data register. As soon as the device returns to the \nReady \nstate, optional data read-out is\n allowed by toggling RE# (see \nFigure 27 on page 46\n), or the Copy Back Program command (85h) with \nthe address cycles o\nf the destination page \nmay be written. The \nProgram Confirm command (10h) \nis required to actually begin \nprogramming.\nThe source and the destination \npages in the Copy Back Program s\nequence must belong to the same device plane (same PLA0 for \nS34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1). Copy Back Read and Copy Back Program \nfor a given plane must be between odd address pages or \nbetween even address pages for the device to meet the program t\nime (t\nPROG\n) specification. Copy Back \nProgram may not meet this \nspecification when c\nopying from an \nodd address page (source pag\ne) to an even address page (t\narget page) or from an even \naddress page (source page) to \nan odd address pa\nge (target page)\n.\nThe data input cycle for modifyin\ng a portion or multiple distin\nct portions of the source page is allowed as shown in \nFigure 28 \non page 46\n. As noted in \nSection 1. on page 4\n the device may include an automa\ntic EDC (for S34ML02G1 and S34\nML04G1) check \nduring the copy back operation,\n to detect single\n bit errors in \nEDC units contained within the so\nurce page. More details on EDC\n \noperation and limitat\nions related to data \ninput handling during\n one Copy Back Program sequence are available in \nSection 3.8 \non page 19\n.\nDocument Number: 002-00676 Rev. *W\n                  \nPage 18 of 70 \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n                                                           \n                                    \nS34ML01G1\nS34ML02G1\nS34ML04G1\nIf a Copy Back Program operation is interrupted by hardware res\net, power failure or other means\n, the host must ensure that the\n \ninterrupted page is not\n used for further read\ning or programming\n operations until the \nnext uninterrupted bl\nock erase is complet\ne.\n3.7.1 Multiplane Copy Back Progr\nam — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nThe device supports Multiplane Co\npy Back Program with exactly t\nhe same sequence and limitati\nons as the Page Program. \nMultiplane Copy Back Program mu\nst be preceded \nby two single pag\ne Copy Back Read command se\nquences (1st page must be \nread from the 1st plane and \n2nd page from the 2nd plane).\nMultiplane Copy Back cannot cross\n plane boundaries — the conten\nts of the source page of one devi\nce plane can be copied only to\n \na destination page of the same \nplane. EDC check is available al\nso for Multiplane Copy Back Pr\nogram only for S34ML02G1 and \nS34ML04G1.\nWhen “EDC check” is used in cop\ny back, it must comply with some\n limitations related to data h\nandling during one Multiplane Cop\ny \nBack Program sequence. Please refer to \nSection 3.8 on page 19\n for details on EDC operation. The\n Multiplane Copy Back Program\n \nsequence represented in \nFigure 29 on page 47\n shows the legacy protocol. In thi\ns case, the blo\nck address bit\ns for the first plane are \nall zero and the second address\n issued selects the block for bo\nth planes. \nFigure 30 on page 47\n describes the s\nequence using the \nONFI protocol. For both addresse\ns issued in this\n protocol, the \nblock address bits must be the s\name except for the bit(s) that \nselect \nthe plane.\nIf a Multiplane Copy Back Progra\nm operation is interrupted by h\nardware reset, power failure or \nother means, the host must ensu\nre \nthat the interrupted pages are n\not used for further reading or \nprogramming operations until the \nnext uninterrupted block erase\ns are \ncomplete for the \napplicable blocks.\n3.7.2 Special Read for Copy B\nack — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nThe S34ML02G1 and S34M\nL04G1 devices support Special Read for Co\npy Back. If Copy Back Read (described in \nSection 3.7\n and \nSection 3.7.1 on page 19\n) is triggered with conf\nirm command ‘36h’ instead ‘35h’, Copy B\nack Read from target page(s) will be \nexecuted with an incr\neased internal (V\nPASS\n) voltage.\nThis special feature is\n used in order to minimize the number of\n read errors due to over-program o\nr read disturb — it shall be \nused \nonly if ECC read errors have o\nccurred in the sour\nce page using \nPage Read or Copy Back Read sequences.\nExcluding the Copy Back Read c\nonfirm command, all other feature\ns described in \nSection 3.7\n and \nSection 3.7.1\n for standard copy \nback remain valid (including the \nfigures referred to in those s\nections).\n3.8 EDC Operation — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nError Detection Code check is a f\neature that can \nbe used during\n the copy back operation (both \nsingle and multiplane) to detect\n \nsingle bit errors occurring in the source page(s).\nNote\n: The S34ML01G1 device does not support EDC.\n\uf06e\nEDC check allows detec\ntion of up to 1 single bit error every 52\n8 bytes, where each 528 byte \ngroup is composed of 512 \nbytes of main arra\ny and 16 bytes of \nspare area (see \nTable 10\n and \nTable 11 on page 21\n). The described 528-byte area is \ncalled an “EDC unit.”\n\uf06e\nIn the ×16 device, EDC allows det\nection of up to 1 single bit e\nrror every 264 words, wher\ne each 264 word group is \ncomposed by 256 words of main arra\ny and 8 words of\n spare area s\nee \nTable 10\n and \nTable 11 on page 21\n). The described \n264-word area is called \n“\nEDC unit.\n”\nEDC results can be checked through a specific Read EDC register\n command, available only after issuing a Copy Back Program or a\n \nMultiplane Copy Back \nProgram. The EDC regi\nster can be queried d\nuring the copy back program busy time (t\nPROG\n).\nFor the “EDC check” feature to \noperate correctly, specific cond\nitions on data input handling \napply for program operations.\nDocument Number: 002-00676 Rev. *W\n                  \nPage 19 of 70 \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n                                                           \n                                    \nS34ML01G1\nS34ML02G1\nS34ML04G1\nFor the case of Page Program, Mu\nltiplane Page Program, Page Rep\nrogram, Multiplane Page Re\nprogram, Cache Program, and \nMultiplane Cache Program operations:\n\uf06e\nIn \nS e c t i o n3 . 2  o np a g e1 5\n it was explained that a number of consecutive partial program \noperations (NOP) is allowed within \nthe same page.

Refer to \nSection 13 on page 22\n for specific Status Regi\nster definition, and to \nFigure 31 on page 48\n for \ntimings.\nIf the Read Status Register comm\nand is issued during multiplane\n operations then Status Regist\ner polling will return the combin\ned \nstatus value related \nto the outcome of t\nhe operation in the two\n planes according to the following table.\nIn other words, the S\ntatus Register is dynamic; the user is not\n required to toggle RE# / CE# to update it.\nThe command register remains in\n Status Read mode until further \ncommands are issued. Therefore, i\nf the Status Register is read \nduring a random read \ncycle, the read comma\nnd (00h) must be issu\ned before starti\nng read cycles.\nNote: The Read Status Register command shall not be used for co\nncurrent operations in multi-die stack configurations (single C\nE#). \n“Read Status Enhanced” \nshall be used instead.\nTable 10.

The c\nommand register is cleared to wa\nit for the next command, and th\ne \nStatus Register is cleared to value E0h when WP# is high or val\nue 60h when WP# is low. If the device is already in reset state\n a new \nReset command will not be accept\ned by the command register. The\n R/B# pin transitions to low for t\nRST\n after the Reset command is \nwritten.

As soon as the user st\narts to read one \npage, the devi\nce automatically load\ns the next page into\n the cache register. S\nerial \ndata output may be executed whil\ne data in the memory is read in\nto the cache register. Read Cache \nis initiated b\ny the Page Read\n \nsequence (00-30h) on a page M.\nAfter random access to the first \npage is complete (R/B# returne\nd to high, or Read Status Regi\nster I/O6 switches to high), two \ncommand sequences can be us\ned to continue \nread cache:\n\uf06e\nRead Cache (command ‘31h’ only): once the command is latched in\nto the command register (see \nFigure 35 on page 49\n), \ndevice goes busy for a short time (t\nCBSYR\n), during which data of\n the first page is t\nransferred from the \ndata register to the \ncache register. At the end of th\nis phase, the cache register da\nta can be output by toggling RE\n# while the next page (page \naddress M+1) is read from the me\nmory array into the data regist\ner.\n\uf06e\nRead Cache Enhanced (sequence ‘00h’ <page N address> ‘31’): onc\ne the command is latched i\nnto the command register \n(see \nFigure 36 on page 50\n), device goes busy for a short time (t\nCBSYR\n), during which dat\na of the first p\nage is transferred \nfrom the data register\n to the cache regist\ner. At the end of thi\ns phase, cache register data \ncan be output by toggling RE# \nwhile page N is read from the me\nmory array into t\nhe data regist\ner. \nNote\n: The S34ML01G1 device does no\nt support Read Cache Enhanced.\nSubsequent pages are read by issuing additional Read Cache or R\nead Cache Enhanced command sequences. If serial data output \ntime of one page exceed\ns random access time (t\nR\n), the random access time of the n\next page is hidden by data do\nwnloading of the \nprevious page.\nOn the other hand, if 31h is issu\ned prior to completing the ran\ndom access to the next page, the dev\nice will stay busy as long \nas \nneeded to complete ra\nndom access to this page, transfer its con\ntents into the cache register, \nand trigger the random access to\n the \nfollowing page.\nTo terminate the Read Cache operation, 3Fh command should be is\nsued (see \nFigure 37 on page 50\n). This command transfers data \nfrom the data register\n to the cache register without issuing ne\nxt page read.\nDuring the Read Cache operation, the device doesn\'t allow any o\nther command except for 00h, 31h, 3Fh, Read SR, or Reset (FFh).\n \nTo carry out other operations, Read Cache must be terminated by\n the Read Cache End command (3Fh) or the device must be reset \nby issuing FFh.\nRead Status command (70h) may be \nissued to check \nthe status of \nthe different registers and the busy/ready status of the cached\n \nread operations.\n\uf06e\nThe Cache-Busy status bit I/O6 i\nndicates when the cache registe\nr is ready to output new data.\n\uf06e\nThe status bit I/O5 can be used \nto determine when the cell read\ning of the current data regi\nster contents is complete.\nNote\n: The Read Cache and Read Cache End commands reset the column c\nounter, thus, when RE# is toggled to output the data of \na given page, the first output d\nata is related to the first byt\ne of the page (column address 00h)\n.

The Cache Progr\nam operation cannot cross a \nblock boundary. The cache register\n allows new dat\na to be input \nwhile the previous d\nata that was transferred to the data regist\ner is \nprogrammed into the memory array.\nAfter the serial data input command (80h) is loaded to the comm\nand register, followed\n by five cycles of address, a full or par\ntial page \nof data is latched int\no the cache register.\nOnce the cache write \ncommand (15h) is loade\nd to the command reg\nister, the data in the \ncache register is tr\nansferred into the d\nata \nregister for cell programming. At\n this time the device remains \nin the Busy state fo\nr a short time (t\nCBSYW\n). After all data of the cache \nregister is transferred into the \ndata register, the device retu\nrns to the Ready state and allows\n loading the next data into th\ne cache \nregister through another Cache \nProgram command sequence (80h-15\nh).\nThe Busy time following the first sequence 80h - 15h equals the\n time needed to transfer the data from the cache register to th\ne data \nregister. Cell programming the d\nata of the data r\negister and lo\nading of the next data into the \ncache register is consequently \nprocessed through a pipeline model.\nIn case of any subsequent sequenc\ne 80h - 15h, transfer from the\n cache register to the data register is held off until cell pro\ngramming \nof current data regist\ner contents is comple\nte; till this moment\n the device will stay\n in a busy state (t\nCBSYW\n).\nRead Status commands (70h or 78h)\n may be issued t\no check the st\natus of the different registers, and the pass/fail status of th\ne \ncached program operations.\n\uf06e\nThe Cache-Busy status bit I/O6 i\nndicates when the cache registe\nr is ready to accept new data.\n\uf06e\nThe status bit I/O5 can be used \nto determine when the cell prog\nramming of the current data r\negister contents is complete.\n\uf06e\nThe Cache Program erro\nr bit I/O1 can be used to identify if the\n previous page (page N-1)\n has been successfully \nprogrammed or not in a Cache Prog\nram operation. The status bit \nis valid upon I/O6 stat\nus bit changing to 1.\n\uf06e\nThe error bit I/O0 is used to identify if any error has been de\ntected by the program/erase controller while programming page \nN. The status bit is valid upon\n I/O5 status bit changing to 1.\nI/O1 may be read t\nogether with I/O0.\nIf the system monitors\n the progress of the \noperation onl\ny with \nR/B#, the last page \nof the target prog\nram sequence must be \nprogrammed with Page Program Confirm command (10h). If the Cach\ne Program command (15h) is used instead, the status bit I/O5 \nmust be polled to find out if the \nlast programming is finished \nbefore starting any \nother operation. See \nTable 13 on page 22\n and \nFigure 38 on page 50\n for more details.\nIf a Cache Program operation is i\nnterrupted by hardware reset, \npower failure or othe\nr means, the host must ensure that the \ninterrupted pages are not used for further reading or programmi\nng operations until the next uninterrupted block erases are com\nplete \nfor the applicable blocks.\nDocument Number: 002-00676 Rev. *W\n                  \nPage 24 of 70 \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n                                                           \n                                     \nS34ML01G1\nS34ML02G1\nS34ML04G1\n3.15 Multiplane Cache Program\n — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nThe Multiplane Cache \nProgram enables high \nprogram throughput by\n programming two pages in paral\nlel, while exploiting the data \nand cache registers of both \nplanes to implement cache.\nThe command sequence can \nbe summarized as follows:\n\uf06e\nSerial Data Input com\nmand (80h), fo\nllowed by the five cycle add\nress inputs and then serial d\nata for the 1st page. Address \nfor this page must be within 1st plane (PLA0 = 0). The data of \n1st page other than those to b\ne programmed do not need to \nbe loaded. The device supports R\nandom Data Input exactly like P\nage Program operation.\n\uf06e\nThe Dummy Page Program Confirm \ncommand (11h) stops 1st page dat\na input and the device bec\nomes busy for a short \ntime (t\nDBSY\n).\n\uf06e\nOnce device returns to ready agai\nn, 81h command must be issued,\n followed by 2nd page address \n(5 cycles) and its se\nrial data input. Addr\ness for this page mus\nt be within 2nd plane (PLA0 = 1)\n. The data of \n2nd page other \nthan those to be programm\ned do not need \nto be loaded.\n\uf06e\nCache Program confirm command (15h). Once the cache write comma\nnd (15h) is loaded to the command register, the data \nin the cache registers is transferred into the data registers f\nor cell programming. At this time the device remains in the Bus\ny \nstate for a short time (t\nCBSYW\n). After all data from the cac\nhe registers are transferred into\n the data registers, the device \nreturns to the Ready state, an\nd allows loading\n the next data in\nto the cache register thr\nough another Cache Program \ncommand sequence.\nThe sequence 80h-...- 11h...-...\n81h...-...15h can be iterated, \nand each time the device will be busy for the t\nCBSYW\n time needed to \ncomplete programming the current\n data register contents, and tr\nansferring the new data from t\nhe cache registers. The sequence \nto \nend Multiplane Cache Program is\n 80h-...- 11h...-...81h...-...10\nh. \nThe Multiplane Cache Program is available only within two paire\nd blocks in separate planes. \nFigure 39 on page 51\n shows the legacy \nprotocol for the Multiplane Cac\nhe Program operation. In this ca\nse, the block address bi\nts for the first plane are all zero and\n the \nsecond address issued \nselects the block \nfor both planes. \nFigure 40 on page 52\n shows the ONFI protocol \nfor the Multiplane Cache \nProgram operation. For both addr\nesses issued in this protocol, \nthe block address bits must be the\n same except for the bit(s) t\nhat \nselect the plane.\nThe user can check oper\nation status by R/B#\n pin or Read Status \nRegister commands (70h or 78h). If\n the user opts for 70h, Read \nStatus Register will provide “g\nlobal” informati\non about the ope\nration in the two planes.\n\uf06e\nI/O6 indicates when both cache r\negisters are ready to accept ne\nw data.\n\uf06e\nI/O5 indicates when the cell pr\nogramming of the current data re\ngisters is complete.\n\uf06e\nI/O1 identifies if t\nhe previous pages in \nboth planes (pages N-1\n) have been successfully progra\nmmed or not. This status bit \nis valid upon I/O6 stat\nus bit changing to 1.\n\uf06e\nI/O0 identifies if any error has\n been detected by the program/e\nrase controller while programming the two pages N. This \nstatus bit is vali\nd upon I/O5 status bit changing to 1.\nSee \nTable 13 on page 22\n for more details.\nIf the system monitors\n the progress of the \noperation onl\ny with \nR/B#, the last pages of the ta\nrget program sequence must be \nprogrammed with Page Program Confirm command (10h). If the Cach\ne Program command (15h) is used instead, the status bit I/O5 \nmust be polled to find out if the last programming is finished \nbefore starting any oth\ner operation. Refer to \nSection 3.9 on page 21\n for \nfurther information.\nIf a Multiplane Cache Program ope\nration is interru\npted by hardw\nare reset, power failure or othe\nr means, the host must ensure t\nhat \nthe interrupted pages\n are not used for further reading or progr\namming operations until\n the next uninterrupt\ned block erases are\n \ncomplete for the \napplicable blocks.\nDocument Number: 002-00676 Rev. *W\n                  \nPage 25 of 70 \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n                                                           \n                                     \nS34ML01G1\nS34ML02G1\nS34ML04G1\n3.16 Read ID\nThe device contains a product id\nentification mode\n, initiated by\n writing 90h to the command reg\nister, followed by an address in\nput of \n00h.\nNote\n: If you want to execute Read St\natus command (0x70) after Read \nID sequence, you should input dummy command (0x00) \nbefore Read Status command (0x70).\nFor the S34ML02G1 and\n S34ML04G1 devices, \nfive read cycles seque\nntially output the ma\nnufacturer code (01h)\n, and the device \ncode and 3rd, 4th, and 5th cycle \nID, respectively.

The address for S34ML01G1 will\n be \n00h-02h-02h-00h. The address for S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1 will b\ne 00h-02h-02h-00h-00h. The ID2 data can then be read from \nthe device by pulsing \nRE#. The command register remains in Read\n ID2 mode until further co\nmmands are issued to it. \nFigure 42 \non page 53\n shows the Read ID2 command sequence. Read ID2 values are all 0\nxFs, unless specific v\nalues are requested when \nordering from Cypress.\n3.18 Read ONFI Signature\nTo retrieve the ONFI s\nignature, the command 90h together with a\nn address of 20h shall \nbe entered (i.e. it i\ns not valid to ente\nr an \naddress of 00h and re\nad 36 bytes to get the \nONFI signature). Th\ne ONFI signature is \nthe ASCII encoding of \'\nONFI\' where \'O\' = 4F\nh, \n\'N\' = 4Eh, \'F\' = 46h, and \'I\' = 4\n9h. Reading beyond four bytes \nyields indeterminate values. \nFigure 43 on page 54\n shows the operation \nsequence.\n3.19 Read Parameter Page\nThe device supports the ONFI Rea\nd Parameter Page operation, ini\ntiated by writing ECh to the com\nmand register, followed by an \naddress input of 00h. The host ma\ny monitor the R/B# pin or wait\n for the maximum data transfer time (t\nR\n) before reading the \nParameter Page data. The command \nregister remains in Parameter \nPage mode until further commands are issued to it. If the Statu\ns \nRegister is read to determine wh\nen the data is ready, the Read \nCommand (00h) must \nbe issued befor\ne starting read cycles. \nFigure 44 on page 54\n shows the operation sequence, while \nTable 3.4\n explains the parameter fields.\nFor ×16 devices, the upper eight\n I/Os are not us\ned and are 0xFF\n.\nNote:\n For 41nm 2Gb/4Gb Cypr\ness NAND, for a parti\ncular condition, the\n Read Parameter Page command\n does not give the correct \nvalues. To overcome th\nis issue, the host must issue a Reset com\nmand before the Read Paramete\nr Page command. Issuance of \nReset before the Read Parameter Page command will provide the c\norrect values and will not outpu\nt 00h values.

Signal Descriptions\n4.1 Data Protection and Power On / Off Sequence\nThe device is designed to offer protection from any involuntary\n program/erase during power-transitions. An internal voltage de\ntector \ndisables all functions whenever V\nCC\n is below about 1.8V.\nThe power-up and power-dow\nn sequence is shown in \nFigure 46 on page 55\n.\nThe Ready/Busy signal shall be va\nlid within 100 µs\n after the po\nwer supplies have reached the mi\nnimum values (as specified on),\n \nand shall return to one\n within 5 ms (max).\nDuring this busy time, the device\n executes the initialization p\nrocess (cam reading), and \ndissipates a current I\nCC0\n (30 mA max), in \naddition, it disrega\nrds all commands excluding Read Status Regi\nster (70h).\nAt the end of this busy time, the \ndevice defaults into “read se\ntup”, thus if the user decides\n to issue a page read command, th\ne 00h \ncommand may be skipped.\nThe WP# pin provides hardware pr\notection and is recommended to \nbe kept at V\nIL\n during power-up and power-down. A recovery time \nof minimum 100 µs is required before the internal circuit gets \nready for any command sequences as shown in \nFigure 46 on page 55\n. \nThe two-step command sequence for \nprogram/erase provides addi\ntional software protection.\n4.2 Ready/Busy\nThe Ready/Busy output provides a\n method of indicating the compl\netion of a page program, erase, c\nopyback, or read completion. \nThe R/B# pin is normally high and goes to low when the device i\ns busy (after a reset, read, program, or erase operation). It r\neturns to \nhigh when the internal controlle\nr has finished the operation. T\nhe pin is an open-drain driver the\nreby allowing two or more R/B\n# \noutputs to be Or-tied. Because t\nhe pull-up resistor value is re\nlated to t\nr\n (R/B#) and the current drain dur\ning busy (ibusy), and output \nload capacitance \nis related to t\nf\n an appropriate value\n can be obtained with the reference chart \nshown in \nFigure 10\n.\nFor example, for a particular \nsystem with 20 pF \nof output load,\n t\nf\n from V\nCC\n to V\nOL\n at 10% to 90% will be \n10 ns, whereas for a \nparticular load of 50 pF, Cypre\nss measured it to be 20 ns as sh\nown in \nFigure 10\n.\nDocument Number: 002-00676 Rev. *W\n                  \nPage 32 of 70 \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n                                                           \n                                     \nS34ML01G1\nS34ML02G1\nS34ML04G1\nFigure 10. Ready/Busy Pin Electrical Application \n4.3 Write Protect Operation\nErase and program operations are aborted if WP# is driven low d\nuring busy time, and kept low for about 100 ns. Switching WP# l\now \nduring this time is equivalent to issuing a Reset command (FFh)\n. The contents of memory cells being altered are no longer vali\nd, as \nthe data will be partially programmed or erased. The R/B# pin w\nill stay low for t\nRST\n (similarly to \nFigure 33 on page 48\n). At the end of \nthis time, the command register is\n ready to process the next co\nmmand, and the Status R\negister bit I/O6 will be cleared to 1, w\nhile \nI/O7 value will be related to\n the WP# value. Refer to \nTable 13 on page 22\n for more information on device status.\nErase and program operations ar\ne enabled or disabled by setting\n WP# to high or low respective\nly, prior to issu\ning the setup \ncommands (80h or 60h). The le\nvel of WP# shall be set t\nWW\n ns prior to raising the WE# pin for the set up command, as exp\nlained in \nFigure 47\n and \nFigure 48 on page 55\n.\nFigure 11.

Error Management\n9.1 System Bad Block Replacement\nOver the lifetime of\n the device, additiona\nl Bad Blocks may deve\nlop. In this case, eac\nh bad block has to be replaced by copying\n any \nvalid data to a new block. These\n additional Bad Blocks can be i\ndentified whenever a program or erase operation reports “Fail” \nin the \nStatus Register.\nThe failure of a page program operation does not affect the dat\na in other pages in the same block, thus the block can be repla\nced by \nre-programming the current data an\nd copying the rest of the rep\nlaced block to an available valid block. Refer to \nTable 24\n and \nFigure 54\n for the recommended procedure to\n follow if an error occurs dur\ning an operation.\nFigure 54. Bad Block Replacement\nNotes\n80. An error occurs on the Nth page of Block A during a program \noperation.\n81. Data in Block A is copied to the same location in Block B, w\nhich is a valid block.\n82. The Nth page of block A, which is in controller buffer memor\ny, is copied into the Nth page of Block B.\n83. Bad block table should be updated to prevent from erasing or\n programming Block A.\nTable 24.

A Bad Block does not aff\nect the performance of valid blo\ncks because it is isolated from the bit line and common source \nline by \na select transistor. The devices \nare supplied with all the loca\ntions inside valid blocks erased\n (FFh). The Bad Block Informati\non is \nwritten prior to shipping. Any block where the 1st byte in the \nspare area of the 1st or 2nd or last page does not contain FFh \nis a Bad \nBlock. That is, if the first pa\nge has an FF value and should ha\nve been a non-FF value, then the non-FF value in the second pag\ne or \nthe last page will ind\nicate a bad block.Th\ne Bad Block Informati\non must be read before any erase i\ns attempted, as\n the Bad Block\n \nInformation may be erased. For \nthe system t\no be able to recogni\nze the Bad Blocks based on the\n original info\nrmation, it is \nrecommended to create a \nBad Block table following the flowchart\n shown in \nFigure 55\n. The host is responsible\n to detect and track \nbad blocks, both factory bad b\nlocks and blocks that may go bad \nduring operation. Once a block \nis found to be bad\n, data should \nnot \nbe written to that block.The 1s\nt block, which is placed on 00h \nblock address is guaranteed to be a valid block.\nFigure 55.
