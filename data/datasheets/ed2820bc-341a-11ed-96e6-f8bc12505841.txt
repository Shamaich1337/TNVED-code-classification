Precautions for General StoragePrecautions for General StoragePrecautions for General StoragePrecautions for General Storage\n•Avoid storage locations where devices may be exposed to moisture or direct sunlight.\n•Do not store the products in locations with poisonous gases (especially corrosive gases) or in dusty\nconditions.\n•Store the products in locations with minimal temperature fluctuations. Rapid temperature changes during\nstorage can cause condensation, resulting in lead oxidation or corrosion, which will deteriorate the\nsolderability of the leads.\n•Do not allow loads to be applied directly to devices while they are in storage.\n•If devices have been stored for more than two years under normal storage conditions, it is recommended\nthat you check the leads for ease of soldering prior to use.\n•Follow the precautions printed on the packing label of the device for transportation and storage.\n•Thermal stress may cause a crack in surface-mount products during surface-mount assembly if they have\nabsorbed atmospheric moisture. To prevent a crack, please observe the following precautions.\n1.  Moisture-proof bags may be stored unopened for up to 12 months under the following conditions. \n           Temperature: 5 \ue00c to 30 \ue00c\n           Humidity: 90 % (max)\n2.  After opening the moisture-proof bag, the devices should be assembled within 168 hours in an\n     environment of 5 \ue00c to 30 \ue00c/70 %RH or below.\n3.  If, upon opening, the moisture indicator card shows a humidity of 30 % or above (i.e., has turned\n     pink) or the expiration date has passed, the devices should be baked in tape and reel.\n     After baking, use the baked devices within 72 hours, but perform baking only once.\n           Baking conditions: 60 ±5 \ue00c, for 64 to 72 hours.\n           Expiration date: 12 months from the sealing date, which is imprinted on the label affixed.\n4.  Repeated baking can affect the peeling strength of taping and cause a trouble during mounting.\n     Furthermore, protect the devices against static electricity for baking.\n5.  If the laminated packing material is broken, its hermeticity deteriorates. Therefore, do not throw or\n    drop the packed devices.\n6.  When restoring devices after removal from their packing, use anti-static containers.2019-12-10\nRev.1.0©2018-2019\nToshiba Electronic Devices & Storage Corporation \nTLP3482\n814. 14. 14. 14.
