TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nIn this application, three 2-input AND gates are combined to produce a 4-input AND gate function as shown in \nTypical Application Block Diagram . The fourth gate can be used for another application in the system, or the \ninputs can be grounded and the channel left unused.\nThe SN74AHCT1G14  is used to directly control the RESET  pin of a motor controller. The controller requires four \ninput signals to all be HIGH before being enabled, and should be disabled in the event that any one signal goes \nLOW. The 4-input AND gate function combines the four individual reset signals into a single active-low reset \nsignal.\n8.2 Typical Application\nOC\nPG\nON/OFFRESETPower Supply\nMotor Controller\nOn/Off SwitchOver \nTemp \nDetectionOver Current \nDetection\nOT\nFigure 8-1. Typical Application Block Diagram\n8.2.1 Design Requirements\n8.2.1.1 Power Considerations\nEnsure the desired supply voltage is within the range specified in the Recommended Operating Conditions . \nThe supply voltage sets the electrical characteristics of the device as described in the Electrical Characteristics \nsection.\nThe positive voltage supply must be capable of sourcing current equal to the maximum static supply current, I CC, \nlisted in the Electrical Characteristics , and any transient current required for switching.\nThe ground must be capable of sinking current equal to the total current to be sunk by all outputs of the \nSN74AHCT1G14  plus the maximum supply current, I CC, listed in the Electrical Characteristics , and any transient \ncurrent required for switching. The logic device can only sink as much current that can be sunk into its ground \nconnection. Be sure to not exceed the maximum total current through GND listed in the Absolute Maximum \nRatings .\nThe SN74AHCT1G14  can drive a load with a total capacitance less than or equal to 50 pF while still meeting \nall of the data sheet specifications. Larger capacitive loads can be applied; however, it is not recommended to \nexceed 50 pF.\nThe SN74AHCT1G14  can drive a load with total resistance described by R L ≥ VO / IO, with the output voltage \nand current defined in the Electrical Characteristics  table with V OL. When outputting in the HIGH state, the output \nwww.ti.comSN74AHCT1G14\nSCLS322R – MARCH 1996 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2024\nCopyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: SN74AHCT1G14\nvoltage in the equation is defined as the difference between the measured output voltage and the supply voltage \nat the V CC pin.\nTotal power consumption can be calculated using the information provided in the CMOS Power Consumption \nand Cpd Calculation  application note.\nThermal increase can be calculated using the information provided in the Thermal Characteristics of Standard \nLinear and Logic (SLL) Packages and Devices  application note.\nCAUTION\nThe maximum junction temperature, T J(max)  listed in the Absolute Maximum Ratings , is an additional \nlimitation to prevent damage to the device. Do not violate any values listed in the Absolute Maximum \nRatings . These limits are provided to prevent damage to the device.\n8.2.1.2 Input Considerations\nInput signals must cross to be considered a logic LOW, and to be considered a logic HIGH. Do not exceed the \nmaximum input voltage range found in the  Absolute Maximum Ratings .\nUnused inputs must be terminated to either V CC or ground. The unused inputs can be directly terminated if the \ninput is completely unused, or they can be connected with a pull-up or pull-down resistor if the input will be used \nsometimes, but not always. A pull-up resistor is used for a default state of HIGH, and a pull-down resistor is \nused for a default state of LOW. The drive current of the controller, leakage current into the SN74AHCT1G14  (as \nspecified in the Electrical Characteristics ), and the desired input transition rate limits the resistor size. A 10-k Ω \nresistor value is often used due to these factors.\nRefer to the Feature Description  section for additional information regarding the inputs for this device.\n8.2.1.3 Output Considerations\nThe ground voltage is used to produce the output LOW voltage. Sinking current into the output will increase the \noutput voltage as specified by the V OL specification in the Electrical Characteristics .\nUnused outputs can be left floating. Do not connect outputs directly to V CC or ground.\nRefer to the Feature Description  section for additional information regarding the outputs for this device.SN74AHCT1G14\nSCLS322R – MARCH 1996 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2024\n www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74AHCT1G14\n8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n1.Add a decoupling capacitor from V CC to GND. The capacitor needs to be placed physically close to the \ndevice and electrically close to both the V CC and GND pins. An example layout is shown in the Layout \nsection.\n2.Ensure the capacitive load at the output is ≤ 50 pF. This is not a hard limit; it will, however, ensure \noptimal performance. This can be accomplished by providing short, appropriately sized traces from the \nSN74AHCT1G14  to one or more of the receiving devices.\n3.Ensure the resistive load at the output is larger than (V CC / IO(max) ) Ω, so that the maximum output current \nfrom the Absolute Maximum Ratings  is not violated. Most CMOS inputs have a resistive load measured in \nMΩ; much larger than the minimum calculated previously.\n4.Thermal issues are rarely a concern for logic gates; the power consumption and thermal increase, however, \ncan be calculated using the steps provided in the application report, CMOS Power Consumption and Cpd \nCalculation .\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nOC\nPG\nON/OFF\nOT\nRESET\nFigure 8-2. Application Timing Diagram\n8.3 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe power supply can be any voltage between the minimum and maximum supply voltage rating located in \nthe Recommended Operating Conditions . Each V CC terminal should have a good bypass capacitor to prevent \npower disturbance. A 0.1- μF capacitor is recommended for this device. It is acceptable to parallel multiple \nbypass capacitors to reject different frequencies of noise. The 0.1- μF and 1-μ F capacitors are commonly used in \nparallel. The bypass capacitor should be installed as close to the power terminal as possible for best results, as \nshown in the following layout example.\n8.4 Layout\n8.4.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple-input and multiple-channel logic devices, inputs must never be left floating. In many cases, \nfunctions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused (for example, when only two inputs of a \ntriple-input AND gate are used or only 3 of the 4 buffer gates are used). Such unused input pins must not be left \nunconnected because the undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. \nAll unused inputs of digital logic devices must be connected to a logic high or logic low voltage, as defined by the \ninput voltage specifications, to prevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular \nunused input depends on the function of the device. Generally, the inputs are tied to GND or V CC, whichever \nmakes more sense for the logic function or is more convenient.\nwww.ti.comSN74AHCT1G14\nSCLS322R – MARCH 1996 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2024\nCopyright © 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: SN74AHCT1G14\n8.4.2 Layout Example\n1GND V CC\n0.1 \x01FBypass capacitor \nplaced close to the \ndeviceRecommend GND flood fill for \nimproved signal isolation, noise \nreduction, and thermal dissipation\nA\n2\n35\n4B\nGNDVCC\nYAvoid 90°  \ncorners for \nsignal lines\nFigure 8-3.
