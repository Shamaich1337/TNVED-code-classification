ADP171  with Adjustable Output Voltage  \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe ADP170 /ADP171 are low voltage input , low quiescent \ncurrent, low -dropout (LDO) linear regulators that operate from \n1.6 V to 3.6 V and provide up to 300 mA of output current. The \nlow 66 mV dropout voltage at 300 mA load improves efficiency \nand allows operation over a wide input voltage range. The low \n23 µA of quiescent current at a 0 mA  load makes the ADP170/  \nADP171 ideal for battery -operated portable equipment.  \nThe ADP170 is capable of  31 fixed -output voltage options, ranging  \nfrom 0.8 V  t o  3 . 0  V.  ADP171 is an adjustable version, which allows  \noutput volta ges that range from 0.8 V to 3. 0 V via an external \ndivider. The ADP170/ ADP171 are optimized for stable operation  \nwith small 1 µF ceramic output capacitors. Ideal for powering digital processors, the ADP170/ ADP171 exhibit good transient performance and occupy  minimal board space. Compared with \ncommodity types of LDOs, the ADP170/ ADP171  provide 20 dB \nto 40 dB better power supply rejection ratio ( PSRR ) at 100 kHz , \nmaking  the ADP170 /ADP171 an ideal  power source for analog -\nto-digital converter ( ADC ) mixed -signal processor systems and \nallowing use of smaller  size bypass cap acitor s. In addition, low \noutput noise performance without the need for an additional \nbypass cap acitor  further reduces printed cir cuit board ( PCB)  \ncomponent count.  \nShort -circuit protection and thermal overload protection circuits  \nprevent damage in adverse conditions. The ADP170 /ADP171 \nare available in tiny 5 -lead TSOT for the smallest footprint \nsolution to meet a variety of portable power applications.  \n \nADP170/ADP171  Data Sheet \n \nRev.

This is a stress \nrating only and functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational \nsection of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute \nmaximum rating conditions for extended perio ds may affect \ndevice reliability.  \nTHERMAL DATA  \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply only individually, not in \ncombination.  The ADP170/ ADP171  can be damaged when the \njunction temperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature does not guarantee that T\nJ is within the specified \ntemperature limits. In applications with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the maximum a mbient temperature \nmay have to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low PCB thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature can exceed the maximum limit as long as the junction temperature is within specification limits. The  junction temperature (T\nJ) of \nthe device is dependent on the ambient temperature (T A), the \npower dissipation of the device (P D), and the junction -to-\nambient thermal resistance of the package (θ JA).  \nMaximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated from the \nambient temperature (T A) and power dissipation (P D) using the \nfollowing formula :  \nTJ = TA + (P D × θJA) \nJunction -to-ambient thermal resistance (θ JA) of the package is \nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4 -layer board. The \njunction -to-ambient thermal r esistance is highly dependent on \nthe application and board layout. In applications where high  maximum power dissipation exists, close attention to thermal board design is required. The value of θ\nJA may vary, depending \non PCB material, layout, and envi ronm ental conditions. The \nspeci fied values of θ JA are based on a 4 -layer, 4 in. × 3 in. PCB. \nRefer to JESD 51 -7 for detailed information regarding board \nconstruction.  \nΨJB is the junction -to-board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W . The ΨJB of the package is based on modeling \nand calculation using a 4 -layer board. The Guidelines for Reporting  \nand Using Electronic Package Thermal Information : JESD51 -12 \nstates that thermal characterization parameters are not the same as thermal resistances. Ψ\nJB measures the component power flowing  \nthrough multiple thermal paths rather than a single path as in \nthermal resistance, θ JB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths include \nconvection from the top of the package as well as radiation from \nthe package —factors that mak e Ψ JB more useful in real -world \napplications. Maximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated \nfrom the board temperature (T B) and power dissipation (P D) \nusing the formula  \nTJ = TB + (P D × ΨJB)  \nRefer to JESD51 -8 and JESD51 -12 for more detailed information  \nabout Ψ JB.  \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE  \nθJA and ΨJB are specified for the worst -case conditions, that is, a \ndevice soldered in a circuit board for surface -mount packages.  \nTable 4.

C | Page 11 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe ADP170 /ADP171 are low quiescent current, low- dropout \nlinear regulator s that operate  from 1.6 V to 3.6 V  and can provide  \nup to 300 mA  of output current.  Drawing a low 1 70 µA of quies -\ncent current (typical) at full load makes the ADP170 /ADP171 \nideal for battery -operated portable equipment. Shutdown current \nconsumption is typically 1 00 nA. \nOptimized for use with small 1 µ F ceramic  capacitors, the \nADP170/ ADP171  provide  excellent transient performance.   \nSHORT CIRCUI T,\nUVLO AND\nTHERMA L\nPROTECT\n0.5V REFERENCEADP170\nSHUTDOWNVIN VOUT\nR1\nR2GND\nNOTES\n1.

ADP171  Internal Block Diagram  Internally, the ADP170/ ADP171  cons ist of a reference, an error \namplifier, a feedback voltage divider , and a PMOS pass transistor.  \nOutput current is delivered via the PMOS pass device , which is \ncontrolled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares \nthe reference voltage with the fe edback voltage from the output \nand amplifies the difference. If the feedback voltage is lower than \nthe reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled lower, \nallowing  more current to pass an d increasing  the output voltage. \nIf the feedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the \ngate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing  less current \nto pass and decreasing  the output voltage.  \nThe adjustable ADP171 has an outp ut voltage r ange of 0.8 V to \n3.0 V . The output voltage is set by the ratio of two external resistors , \nas shown in Figure 2. The device servos the output to maintain \nthe voltage at the ADJ pin at 0.5 V referenced to ground. The \ncurrent in R1 is then equal to 0.5 V/R2 and the current in R1 is the current in R2 plus the ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ pin bias current, 1 5 nA at 25°C, flows through R1 into the ADJ pin.  \nThe output voltage can be calculated using the equation:  \nV\nOUT = 0.5 V(1 + R1 /R2) + (ADJ I-BIAS)(R1 ) \nThe value of R1  should be less than 2 00 kΩ to minimize errors \nin the output voltage caused by the ADJ pin bias current. For example , when  R1 and R2 each equal  200 kΩ, the output voltage  \nis 1.0 V . The output voltage error introduced by t he ADJ pin \nbias current is 3  mV or 0. 3%, assuming a typical ADJ pin bias \ncurrent of 1 5 nA at  25°C.  \nNote that in shutdown , the output is turned off and the divider \ncurrent is zero.  \nThe ADP170 /ADP171 use the EN pin to enable and disable the \nVOUT pin under normal operating conditions. When EN is high, \nVOUT turns on;  when EN is low, V OUT turns off. For automatic  \nstartup, EN can be tied to V IN. \n \nADP170/ADP171 Data Sheet\n \nRev. C | Page 12 of 20 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nOutput Capacitor \nThe ADP170 /ADP171  are designed for operation with small, \nspace-saving ceramic capacitors but will function with most \ncommonly used capacitors as long as care is taken with regard to the effective series resistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the stability of the LDO control loop.  \nA minimum of 1 μF capacitance with an ESR of 1 Ω or less is \nrecommended to ensure stability of the ADP170 /ADP171 . The \ntransient response to changes in load current is also affected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient response of the ADP170 /ADP171  to \nlarge changes in load current. Figure 27 and Figure 28 show the \ntransient responses for output capacitance values of 1 μF and \n4.7 μF, respectively. \n07716-125\nCH1 200mA Ω CH2 50.0mVBW M200ns A CH1      112mA1\n2\nT    500.000nsILOAD\nVOUT\nVOUT = 1.8V\nCIN = COUT = 1µF1mA TO 300mA LOAD STEP,\n2.5A/µs\n \nFigure 27.

Output Transient Response, C OUT = 4.7 μF \n Input Bypass Capacitor \nConnecting a 1 μF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the \ncircuit sensitivity to the printed circuit board (PCB) layout, \nespecially when long input traces or high source impedance  \nare encountered. If greater than 1 μF of output capacitance is \nrequired, the input capacitor should be increased to match it. \nInput and Output Capacitor Properties \nAny good quality ceramic capacitor can be used with the \nADP170 /ADP171 , as long as it meets the minimum capacitance \nand maximum ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manu-\nfactured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have a dielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over the \nnecessary temperature range and dc bias conditions. A X5R or X7R \ndielectric with a voltage rating of 6.3 V or 10 V is recommended. The Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are not recommended, due to their \npoor temperature and dc bias characteristics.  \nFigure 29 depicts the capacitance vs. bias voltage characteristics \nof a 0402, 1 μF, 10 V X5R capacitor. The variance of a capacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In \ngeneral, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage rating \nwill exhibit less capacitance variance over bias voltage. The temperature variation of the X5R dielectric is about ±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range and is not a function of \npackage or voltage rating. \n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.60.40.2\n0\n02468 1 0\n07716-025CAPACITANCE (µF)\nBIAS VOLTAGE (V) \nFigure 29. Capacitance vs. Bias Voltage Characteristics \nUse Equation 1 to determine the worst-case capacitance \naccounting for capacitor variation over temperature, \ncomponent tolerance, and voltage. \nCEFF = CBIAS × (1 − TEMPCO ) × (1 − TOL) (1) \nwhere: \nCBIAS is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage. \nTEMPCO  is the worst-case capacitor temperature coefficient. \nTOL  is the worst-case component tolerance. \nData Sheet ADP170/ADP171\n \nRev. C | Page 13 of 20 In this example, the worst-case temperature coefficient \n(TEMPCO) over −40°C to +85°C is assumed to be 15% for an X5R dielectric. The tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed \nto be 10%, and C\nBIAS is 0.94 μF at 1.8 V , as shown in Figure 29. \nSubstituting these values in Equation 1 yields \nCEFF = 0.94 μF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 0.719 μF \nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the \nminimum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temper-ature and tolerance at the chosen output voltage. \nTo guarantee the performance of the ADP170/ ADP171 , it is \nimperative that the effects of dc bias, temperature, and toler-\nances on the behavior of the capacitors are evaluated for each \napplication. \nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT \nThe ADP170 /ADP171  have an internal undervoltage lockout \ncircuit that disables all inputs and the output when the input \nvoltage is less than approximately 1.2 V . This ensures that the ADP170 /ADP171  inputs and the output behave in a predictable \nmanner during power-up. \nENABLE FEATURE \nThe ADP170 /ADP171  use the EN pin to enable and disable the \nVOUT pin under normal operating conditions. As shown in Figure 30, when a rising voltage on EN crosses the active threshold, VOUT turns on. When a falling voltage on EN \ncrosses the inactive threshold, VOUT turns off. \n00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6\nVENVOUT\n07716-230\n \nFigure 30. ADP170 /ADP171  Typical EN Pin Operation \nAs shown in Figure 30, the EN pin has hysteresis built in. This \nprevents on/off oscillations that can occur due to noise on the \nEN pin as it passes through the threshold points.  The EN pin active/inactive thresholds are derived from the VIN \nvoltage. Therefore, these thresholds vary with changing input voltage.

C | Page 14 of 20 CURRENT L IMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADP170 /ADP171 are protected ag ainst damage due to \nexcessive power dissipation by current and thermal overload \nprotection circuits . The ADP170 /ADP171 are designed to  limit \nthe current when the output load reaches  450 mA (typical).  \nWhen the output load exceeds 450 mA, the output voltage is \nreduced to maintain a constant current limit.  \nThermal overload protection is included , which limit s the junction  \ntemperature to a m aximum of 150°C  (typical) . Under extreme \nconditions (that is, high ambient temperature and power dissip -\nation) , when  the junction temperature starts to rise above 150°C,  \nthe output is turned off , reduc ing the output current to 0. When \nthe junction temperat ure drops below 135°C, t he output is turned  \non again and output current is restored to its nominal value . \nConsider the case where a hard  short from VOUT to GND  occurs.  \nAt first , the ADP170 /ADP171 will limit the current so that only \n450 mA is conducted into the short. If self-heating  of the junction  \nis great enough to cause its temperature to rise above 150°C , \nthermal shutdown  will activa te, turning off the output and \nreducing the output current to 0. As the junction temperature \ncools and drops below 135°C, the output turn s on and conduct s \n450 mA into the short, again caus ing the junction temperature \nto rise above 150°C. This  thermal oscil lation between 135°C  \nand 150°C cause s a current oscillation between 450 mA and 0  mA, \nwhich continue s as long as the short remains at the output.  \nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect \nthe device against accidenta l overload condition s.  \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS  \nTo guarantee reliable  operation, the junction temperature of the \nADP170/ ADP171  must  not exceed 125°C.  To en sure the junction  \ntemperature stays bel ow this maximum value, the user needs to  \nbe aware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature  \nchanges. Thes e parameters include ambient temperature, power \ndissipation in the power device , and thermal res istances between  \nthe junction and ambient air ( θJA). The θ JA number is dependent \non the  package assembly compounds used and the amount of \ncopper to which the GND pin  of the package is  soldered on the \nPCB . Table 6 shows typical θ JA values  of the 5 -lead TSOT  package  \nfor various PCB copper sizes.  \nTable 6.

Therefore , the junction temperature equation \nsimplifies to the following:  \nTJ = TA + {[( VIN − VOUT) × ILOAD] × θJA} (4) \nAs shown in Equation 4 , for a given  ambient temperature,  input \nto output voltage differenti al, and continuous load current, \nthere exists a minimum copper size requirement for the PCB  to \nensure  that the junction temperature does not rise above 125°C. \nFigure 33 to Figure 38 show junction temperature  calculations \nfor different ambient temperatures, load currents, V IN to V OUT \ndifferential s, and areas of PCB copper.  \n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n07716-028JUNCTION TEMPERATURE (°C)\nVOUT – V IN (V)ILOAD  = 1mA ILOAD  = 10mAILOAD  = 25mAILOAD  = 100mAILOAD  = 150mAILOAD  = 300mATJ MAX\n \nFigure 33. 500 mm2 of PCB Copper, T A = 25°C  \n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n07716-029JUNCTION TEMPERATURE (°C)\nVOUT – V IN (V)ILOAD  = 1mAILOAD  = 10mAILOAD  = 25mAILOAD  = 100mAILOAD  = 150mAILOAD  = 300mATJ MAX\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n \nFigure 34. 100 mm2 of PCB Copper, T A = 25 °C \nData Sheet ADP170/ADP171  \n \nRev.
