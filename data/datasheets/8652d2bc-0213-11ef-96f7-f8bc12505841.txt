This device provides a small signal \nconversion gain of 13 dB with a noise figure of 2 dB and \n24 dBc of image rejection across the frequency band. \nThe HMC951BLP4 e utilizes an low noise amplifier \n(LNA) followed by an image reject mixer which is \ndriven by an LO buffer amplifier. The image reject \nmixer eliminates the need for a filter following the LNA \nand removes thermal noise at the image frequency. i \nand Q mixer outputs are provided and an external 90° \nhybrid is needed to select the required sideband. The \nHMC951BLP4 e is a much smaller alternative to hybrid \nstyle image reject mixer downconverter assemblies \nand is compatible with surface mount manufacturing \ntechniques.\nElectrical Specifications, TA = +25 °C\n IF = 1000 MHz, LO = +2 dBm, VDRF = VDLO1 = VDLO2 = 3.5 V, LSB  [1]\nParameter Min.

### Component Summary: HMC951BLP4ETR

**Description:**
The HMC951BLP4ETR is a compact GaAs MMIC (Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit) I/Q downconverter designed for use in RF (Radio Frequency) applications. It operates within a frequency range of 5.6 to 8.6 GHz and is particularly suited for point-to-point and point-to-multi-point radios, military radar, electronic warfare, and satellite communications. The device integrates a low noise amplifier (LNA) and an image reject mixer, eliminating the need for additional filtering after the LNA.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VDRF, VDLO1, VDLO2): 3.5 V (max 4.5 V)
  
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Total Supply Current: 160 to 200 mA
  
- **Power Consumption:**
  - Continuous Power Dissipation: 1.184 W (derated at 13.16 mW/°C above 85°C)
  
- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +85 °C
  
- **Package Type:**
  - 24 Lead 4 mm x 4 mm SMT (Surface Mount Technology) package
  
- **Special Features:**
  - Conversion Gain: 13 dB
  - Noise Figure: 2 dB
  - Image Rejection: 24 dBc
  - Input Third-Order Intercept (IP3): 1 dBm
  - Input Power for 1 dB Compression (P1dB): -5 dBm
  - LO to RF Isolation: 48 dB
  - Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL): MSL3 (according to JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The HMC951BLP4ETR is ideal for:
- Point-to-Point and Point-to-Multi-Point Radios
- Military Radar Systems
- Electronic Warfare (EW) Applications
- Satellite Communications

This device is particularly beneficial in applications requiring high performance in terms of noise figure and image rejection, making it suitable for advanced communication systems where signal integrity is critical.
