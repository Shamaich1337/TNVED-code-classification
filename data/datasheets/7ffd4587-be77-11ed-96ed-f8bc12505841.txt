Use Precautions \n11.1  Handling precautions \n(1) The polarizing plate may break easily so be careful when ha ndling it. Do not touch, \npress or rub it with a hard-ma terial tool like tweezers. \n(2) Do not touch the polarizi ng plate surface with bare hands s o as not to make it dirty. \nIf the surface or other related part of the polarizing plate is  dirty, soak a soft cotton \ncloth or chamois leather in benzine and wipe off with it. Do no t use chemical \nliquids such as acetone, toluene  and isopropyl alcohol. Failure  to do so may bring \nchemical reaction phenom ena and deteriorations. \n(3) Remove any spit or water imme diately. If it is left for hou rs, the suffered part may \ndeform or decolorize. \n(4) If the LCD element breaks and any LC stuff leaks, do not su ck or lick it. Also if LC \nstuff is stuck on your skin or clothing, wash thoroughly with s oap and water \nimmediately. \n \n11.2  Installing precautions \n(1) The PCB has many ICs that may be damaged easily by static e lectricity. To \nprevent breaking by static electr icity from the human body and clothing, earth the \nhuman body properly using the high resistance and discharge sta tic electricity \nduring the operation. In this case, however, the resistance val ue should be approx. \n1MΩ and the resistance should be placed near the human body rat her than the \nground surface. When the indoor s pace is dry, static electricit y may occur easily \nso be careful. We recommend the indoor space should be kept wit h humidity of \n60% or more. When a soldering iron or other similar tool is use d for assembly, be \nsure to earth it. \n(2) When installing the module a nd ICs, do not bend or twist th em. Failure to do so \nmay crack LC element and cause circuit failure. \n(3) To protect LC element, espec ially polarizing plate, use a t ransparent protective \nplate (e.g., acrylic plate, glass etc) for the product case. \n(4) Do not use an adhesive like a both-side adhesive tape to ma ke LCD surface \n(polarizing plate) and product case stick together. Failure to do so may cause the \npolarizing plate to peel off. \n \n     \nDate: 2022/04/19                    A M P I R E  C O., LTD.                      2 1  11.3  Storage precautions \n(1) Avoid a high temperature and humidity area. Keep the temper ature between 0°C \nand 35°C and also the humidity under 60%. \n(2) Choose the dark spaces where the product is not exposed to direct sunlight or \nfluorescent light. \n(3) Store the products as they a re put in the boxes provided fr om us or in the same \nconditions as we recommend. \n \n11.4  Operating precautions \n(1) Do not boost the applied drive voltage abnormally. Failure to do so may break ICs. \nWhen applying power voltage, check the electrical features befo rehand and be \ncareful. Always turn off the power to the LC module controller before removing or \ninserting the LC module input connector. If the input connector  is removed or \ninserted while the power is tur ned on, the LC module internal c ircuit may break. \n(2) The display response may be l ate if the operating temperatu re is under the \nnormal standard, and the display may be out of order if it is a bove the normal \nstandard. But this is not a fa ilure; this will be restored if i t is within the normal \nstandard. \n(3) The LCD contrast varies depen ding on the visual angle, ambi ent temperature, \npower voltage etc. Obtain the opt imum contrast by adjusting the  LC dive voltage. \n(4) When carrying out the test, do not take the module out of t he low-temperature \nspace suddenly. Failure to do so will cause the module condensi ng, leading to \nmalfunctions. \n(5) Make certain that each signal noise level is within the sta ndard (L level: 0.2Vdd or \nless and H level: 0.8Vdd or more) even if the module has functi oned properly. If it \nis beyond the standard, the module may often malfunction. In ad dition, always \nconnect the module when making noise level measurements. \n(6) The CMOS ICs are incorporat ed in the module and the pull-up  and pull-down \nfunction is not adopted for the input so avoid putting the inpu t signal open while \nthe power is ON. \n(7) The characteristic of the semiconductor element changes whe n it is exposed to \nlight emissions, therefore ICs on the LCD may malfunction if th ey receive light \nemissions. To prevent these malfunctions, design and assemble I Cs so that they \nare shielded from light emissions. \n(8) Crosstalk occurs because of  characteristics of the LCD. In general, crosstalk \noccurs when the regularized displa y is maintained. Also, crosst alk is affected by \nthe LC drive voltage. Design t he contents of the display, consi dering crosstalk. \n    \nDate: 2022/04/19                    A M P I R E  C O., LTD.                      2 2  11.5  Other \n(1) Do not disassemble or take the LC module into pieces. The L C modules once \ndisassembled or taken into pie ces are not the guarantee article s. \n(2) Do not keep the LCD at the sa me display pattern continually . The residual image \nwill happen and it will damage the L CD. Please use screen saver . \n(3) AMIPRE will provide one year warrantee for all products and  three months \nwarrantee for all repairing products. \nDate: 2022/04/19                    A M P I R E  C O ., LTD.                      2 3  12.
