Both the high/low temperature trip points and hysteresis (overshoot) band are determined by user-selected external resistors. For high volume \nproduction, these resistors are available on board.  \nThe TMP01 consists of a band gap voltage reference combined \nwith a pair of matched comparators. The reference provides \nboth a constant 2.5 V output and a voltage proportional to \nabsolute temperature (VPTAT) which has a precise temperature \ncoefficient of 5 mV/K and is 1.49 V (nominal) at 25°C. The comparators compare VPTAT with the externally set tempera-ture trip points and generate an open-collector output signal when one of their respective thresholds has been exceeded.  \n Hysteresis is also programmed by the external resistor chain \nand is determined by the total current drawn out of the 2.5 V \nreference. This current is mirrored and used to generate a hysteresis offset voltage of the appropriate polarity after a comparator has been tripped. The comparators are connected in parallel, which guarantees that there is no hysteresis overlap \nand eliminates erratic transitions between adjacent trip zones.  \nThe TMP01 utilizes proprietary thin-film resistors in conjunc-\ntion with production laser trimming to maintain a temperature \naccuracy of ±1°C (typical) over the rated temperature range, \nwith excellent linearity. The open-collector outputs are capable \nof sinking 20 mA, enabling the TMP01 to drive control relays directly. Operating from a 5 V supply, quiescent current is only \n500 μA (max).  \nThe TMP01 is available in 8-pin mini PDIP , SOIC, and TO-99 \npackages. \n \n\nTMP01 \n \nRev.

E | Page 8 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION\nThe TMP01 is a linear voltage-output temperature sensor, with \na window comparator that can be programmed by the user to \nactivate one of two open-collector outputs when a predeter-mined temperature setpoint voltage has been exceeded. A low \ndrift voltage reference is available for setpoint programming.  \nThe temperature sensor is basically a very accurate, temperature \ncompensated, band gap-type voltage reference with a buffered output voltage proportional to absolute temperature (VPTAT), accurately trimmed to a scale factor of 5 mV/K.  \nThe low drift 2.5 V reference output VREF is easily divided \nexternally with fixed resistors or potentiometers to accurately establish the programmed heat/cool setpoints, independent of temperature. Alternatively, the setpoint voltages can be supplied by other ground referenced voltage sources such as user-programmed DACs or controllers. The high and low setpoint \nvoltages are compared to the temperature sensor voltage, thus \ncreating a two-temperature thermostat function. In addition, the total output current of the reference (I\nVREF) determines the \nmagnitude of the temperature hysteresis band. The open collector outputs of the comparators can be used to control a wide variety of devices.  \nVPTATV+\nWINDOW\nCOMPARATOR\nTEMPERATURE\nOUTPUTHYSTERESIS\nCURRENT\nCURRENT\nMIRROR\nHYSTERESIS\nVOLTAGEENABLE\nTMP01VREF\nSET\nHIGH\nSET\nLOW\nGNDUNDEROVER8\n5671\n432\nVOLTAGE\nREFERENCE\nAND\nSENSOR1kΩIHYS\n00333-013 \nFigure 13. Detailed Block Diagram \nTEMPERATURE HYSTERESIS \nThe temperature hysteresis is the number of degrees beyond  \nthe original setpoint temperature that must be sensed by the \nTMP01 before the setpoint comparator is reset and the output disabled. Figure 14  shows the hysteresis profile. The hysteresis  \nis programmed by the user by setting a specific load on the \nreference voltage output VREF. This output current I\nVREF is also \ncalled the hysteresis current, which is mirrored internally and \nfed to a buffer with an analog switch.

TMP01 Hysteresis Profile  \nAfter a temperature setpoint is exceeded and a comparator \ntripped, the buffer output is enabled. The output is a current  of the appropriate polarity that generates a hysteresis offset volt-age across an internal 1000 Ω resistor at the comparator input. The comparator output remains on until the voltage at the comparator input, now equal to the temperature sensor voltage \nVPTAT summed with the hysteresis offset, returns to the \nprogrammed setpoint voltage. The comparator then returns low, deactivating the open-collector output and disabling the hysteresis current buffer output. The scale factor for the \nprogrammed hysteresis current is:  \nI\nHYS = I VREF = 5 μA/°C + 7 μA \nThus, since VREF = 2.5 V , with a reference load resistance  \nof 357 kΩ or greater (output current 7 μA or less), the temper-\nature setpoint hysteresis is zero degrees. Larger values of load resistance only decrease the output current below 7 μA and have no effect on the operation of the device. The amount of hysteresis is determined by selecting a value of load resistance for VREF.  \nPROGRAMMING THE TMP01  \nIn the basic fixed setpoint application utilizing a simple resistor \nladder voltage divider, the desired temperature setpoints are \nprogrammed in the following sequence:  \n1. Select the desired hysteresis temperature.  \n2. Calculate the hysteresis current I VREF.  \n3. Select the desired setpoint temperatures.  \n4. Calculate the individual resistor divider ladder values \nneeded to develop the desired comparator setpoint voltages \nat SET HIGH and SET LOW .  \n TMP01\n \nRev. E | Page 9 of 20 The hysteresis current is readily calculated. For example, for  \n2 degrees of hysteresis, I VREF = 17 μA. Next, the setpoint \nvoltages, V SETHIGH  and V SETLOW , are determined using the VPTAT \nscale factor of 5 mV/K = 5 mV/(°C + 273.15), which is 1.49 V for 25°C. Then, calculate the divider resistors, based on those \nsetpoints. The equations used to calculate the resistors are \nV\nSETHIGH  = (TSETHIGH  + 273.15) (5 mV/°C) \nVSETLOW  = (TSETLOW  + 273.15) (5 mV/°C) \nR1 (kΩ)  = (VVREF − VSETHIGH )/IVREF = (2.5 V − V SETHIGH )/IVREF \nR2 (kΩ) = (V SETHIGH  − VSETLOW )/IVREF \nR3 (kΩ)  = VSETLOW /IVREF \nVPTATV+ 1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5TMP01VVREF  = 2.5V\nVSETHIGH\nVSETLOW\nGNDUNDEROVER(VVREF  – VSETHIGH )/IVREF  = R1\n(VSETHIGH  – VSETLOW )/IVREF  = R2\nVSETLOW /IVREF  = R3IVREF\n00333-015 \nFigure 15. TMP01 Setpoint Programming  \nThe total R1 + R2 + R3 is equal to the load resistance needed to \ndraw the desired hysteresis current from the reference, or I VREF.  \nThe formulas shown above are also helpful in understanding \nthe calculation of temperature setpoint voltages in circuits other than the standard two-temperature thermostat. If a setpoint \nfunction is not needed, the appropriate comparator should be \ndisabled. SET HIGH can be disabled by tying it to V+, SET LOW by tying it to GND. Either output can be left \nunconnected.  \nVPTATK\n°C\n°F\n1.09 1.24 1.99 1.865 1.74 1.615 1.49 1.365218 248 398 373 348 323 298 273\n–67 –25 257 200 212 150 100 50 7732 0–55 –25 125 100 75 50 25 0 –18\n00333-016 \nFigure 16. Temperature—VPTAT Scale \nUNDERSTANDING ERROR SOURCES  \nThe accuracy of the VPTAT sensor output is well characterized \nand specified; however, preserving this accuracy in a heating or \ncooling control system requires some attention to minimizing the various potential error sources. The internal sources of setpoint programming error include the initial tolerances and \ntemperature drifts of the reference voltage VREF, the setpoint \ncomparator input offset voltage and bias current, and the hysteresis current scale factor. When evaluating setpoint programming errors, remember that any VREF error \ncontribution at the comparator inputs is reduced by the  resistor divider ratios. The comparator input bias current \n(inputs SET HIGH, SET LOW) drops to less than 1 nA (typ) when the comparator is tripped. This can account for some setpoint voltage error, equal to the change in bias current times the effective setpoint divider ladder resistance to ground.  \nThe thermal mass of the TMP01 package and the degree of \nthermal coupling to the surrounding circuitry are the largest \nfactors in determining the rate of thermal settling, which ultimately determines the rate at which the desired temperature measurement accuracy may be reached. Thus, allow sufficient time for the device to reach the final temperature. The typical \nthermal time constant for the plastic package is approximately \n140 seconds in still air. Therefore, to reach the final temperature accuracy within 1%, for a temperature change of 60 degrees, a \nsettling time of 5 time constants, or 12 minutes, is necessary.  \nThe setpoint comparator input offset voltage and zero hyster-\nesis current affect setpoint error. While the 7 μA zero hysteresis \ncurrent allows the user to program the TMP01 with moderate \nresistor divider values, it does vary somewhat from device to \ndevice, causing slight variations in the actual hysteresis obtained in practice. Comparator input offset directly impacts the pro-grammed setpoint voltage and thus the resulting hysteresis \nband, and must be included in error calculations.  \nExternal error sources to consider are the accuracy of the pro-\ngramming resistors, grounding error voltages, and the overall \nproblem of thermal gradients. The accuracy of the external \nprogramming resistors directly impacts the resulting setpoint accuracy. Thus, in fixed-temperature applications, the user should select resistor tolerances appropriate to the desired programming accuracy. Resistor temperature drift must be taken into account also. This effect can be minimized by \nselecting good quality components, and by keeping all com-\nponents in close thermal proximity. Applications requiring high measurement accuracy require great attention to detail \nregarding thermal gradients. Careful circuit board layout, \ncomponent placement, and protection from stray air currents are necessary to minimize common thermal error sources.  \nAlso, the user should take care to keep the bottom of the set-\npoint programming divider ladder as close to GND (Pin 4) as \npossible to minimize errors due to IR voltage drops and coup-ling of external noise sources. In any case, a 0.1 μF capacitor for \npower supply bypassing is always recommended at the chip.  \nSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS IN HEATING AND \nCOOLING SYSTEM DESIGN  \nDesigners should anticipate potential system fault conditions, \nwhich may result in significant safety hazards, which are outside \nthe control of and cannot be corrected by the TMP01-based \ncircuit. Observe governmental and industrial regulations regarding safety requirements and standards for such designs \nwhere applicable. \n \nTMP01 \n \nRev. E | Page 10 of 20 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nSELF-HEATING EFFECTS  \nIn some applications, the user should consider the effects of \nself-heating due to the power dissipated by the open-collector \noutputs, which are capable of sinking 20 mA continuously. Under full load, the TMP01 open-collector output device is dissipating  \nP\nDISS = 0.6 V × .020A = 12 mW \nwhich in a surface-mount SOIC package accounts for a \ntemperature increase due to self-heating of \nΔT = PDISS × θ JA = .012 W × 158°C/W = 1.9°C \nThis self-heating effect directly affects the accuracy of the \nTMP01 and will, for example, cause the device to activate  \nthe OVER  output 2 degrees early. \nBonding the package to a moderate heat sink limits the self-\nheating effect to approximately: \nΔT = PDISS × θ JC = .012 W × 43°C/W = 0.52°C \nwhich is a much more tolerable error in most systems. The \nVREF and VPTAT outputs are also capable of delivering sufficient current to contribute heating effects and should not \nbe ignored.  \nBUFFERING THE VOLTAGE REFERENCE  \nThe reference output VREF is used to generate the temper- \nature setpoint programming voltages for the TMP01 and also  \nto determine the hysteresis temperature band by the reference \nload current I VREF. The on-board output buffer amplifier is \ntypically capable of 500 μA output drive into as much as 50 pF load (maximum). Exceeding this load affects the accuracy  of the reference voltage, could cause thermal sensing errors  \ndue to dissipation, and may induce oscillations. Selection of  \na low drift buffer functioning as a voltage follower with high input impedance ensures optimal reference accuracy, and  does not affect the programmed hysteresis current. Amplifiers which offer the low drift, low power consumption, and low cost \nappropriate to this application include the OP295, and members \nof the OP90, OP97, OP177 families, and others as shown in the \nfollowing applications circuits.  \nWith excellent drift and noise characteristics, VREF offers a \ngood voltage reference for data acquisition and transducer excitation applications as well. Output drift is typically better than −10 ppm/°C, with 315 nV/√Hz (typ) noise spectral density at 1 kHz.  PRESERVING ACCURACY OVER WIDE \nTEMPERATURE RANGE OPERATION  \nThe TMP01 is unique in offering both a wide range temper-\nature sensor and the associated detection circuitry needed  \nto implement a complete thermostatic control function in  \none monolithic device. While the voltage reference, setpoint \ncomparators, and output buffer amplifiers have been carefully compensated to maintain accuracy over the specified temper-ature range, the user has an additional task in maintaining the accuracy over wide operating temperature ranges in the application.  \nSince the TMP01 is both sensor and control circuit, in many \napplications it is possible that the external components used to \nprogram and interface the device may be subjected to the same temperature extremes. Thus, it may be necessary to locate components in close thermal proximity to minimize large temperature differentials, and to account for thermal drift \nerrors, such as resistor matching tempcos, amplifier error drift, \nand the like, where appropriate. Circuit design with the TMP01 requires a slightly different perspective regarding the thermal \nbehavior of electronic components.  \nTHERMAL RESPONSE TIME  \nThe time required for a temperature sensor to settle to a speci-\nfied accuracy is a function of the thermal mass of the sensor, \nand the thermal conductivity between the sensor and the object being sensed. Thermal mass is often considered equivalent to capacitance.  \nThermal conductivity is commonly specified using the symbol \nQ, and can be thought of as the reciprocal of thermal resistance. \nIt is commonly specified in units of degrees per watt of power \ntransferred across the thermal joint. Thus, the time required  for the TMP01 to settle to the desired accuracy is dependent  on the package selected, the thermal contact established in that \nparticular application, and the equivalent power of the heat \nsource. In most applications, the settling time is probably best \ndetermined empirically.  \n TMP01\n \nRev. E | Page 11 of 20 SWITCHING LOADS WITH THE OPEN-COLLECTOR \nOUTPUTS  \nIn many temperature sensing and control applications, some \ntype of switching is required. Whether it be to turn on a heater \nwhen the temperature goes below a minimum value or to turn \noff a motor that is overheating, the open-collector outputs  \nOVER  and UNDER  can be used. For the majority of \napplications, the switches used need to handle large currents on the order of 1 A and above. Because the TMP01 is accurately measuring temperature, the open-collector outputs should \nhandle less than 20 mA of current to minimize self-heating.  \nThe OVER\n and UNDER  outputs should not drive the equip-\nment directly. Instead, an external switching device is required \nto handle the large currents. Some examples of these are relays, \npower MOSFETs, thyristors, IGBTs, and Darlingtons.  \nFigure 17  through Figure 21  show a variety of circuits where the \nTMP01 controls a switch. The main consideration in these \ncircuits, such as the relay in Figure 17 , is the current required to \nactivate the switch.  \nTEMPERATURE\nSENSOR AND\nVOLTAGE\nREFERENCEVREF VPTAT\n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5HYSTERESIS\nGENERATORWINDOW\nCOMPARATOR\nTMP01R1\nR2\nR3MOTOR\nSHUTDOWN\n2604-12-311\nCOTOIN4001\nOR EQUIV.12V\n00333-017 \nFigure 17. Reed Relay Drive \nIt is important to check the particular relay to ensure that the \ncurrent needed to activate the coil does not exceed the TMP01’s recommended output current of 20 mA. This is easily deter-\nmined by dividing the relay coil voltage by the specified coil \nresistance. Keep in mind that the inductance of the relay creates large voltage spikes that can damage the TMP01 output unless \nprotected by a commutation diode across the coil, as shown.  \nThe relay shown has a contact rating of 10 W maximum. If  \na relay capable of handling more power is desired, the larger contacts probably require a commensurately larger coil, with lower coil resistance and thus higher trigger current. As the \ncontact power handling capability increases, so does the current \nneeded for the coil. In some cases, an external driving transistor \nshould be used to remove the current load on the TMP01.  \nPower FETs are popular for handling a variety of high current \ndc loads. Figure 18  shows the TMP01 driving a p-channel \nMOSFET transistor for a simple heater circuit. When the out-put transistor turns on, the gate of the MOSFET is pulled down \nto approximately 0.6 V , turning it on. For most MOSFETs, a \ngate-to-source voltage, or Vgs, on the order of −2 V to −5 V  \nis sufficient to turn the device on.  Figure 19  shows a similar circuit for turning on an n-channel \nMOSFET, except that now the gate to source voltage is positive. \nFor this reason, an external transistor must be used as an \ninverter so that the MOSFET turns on when the UNDER\n \noutput pulls down.  \nTEMPERATURE\nSENSOR AND\nVOLTAGE\nREFERENCEVREF VPTAT\n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5HYSTERESIS\nGENERATORWINDOW\nCOMPARATOR\nNC = NO CONNECTTMP01R1\nR2\nR3\nNCNC\nIRFR9024\nOR EQUIV.\nHEATINGELEMENT2.4kΩ (12V)\n1.2kΩ (6V)\n5%V+\n+\n00333-018 \nFigure 18.

By picking a transistor that can accommodate large amounts of current, many high power \ndevices can be switched.  The last class of high power devices discussed here are \nthyristors, which includes SCRs and Triacs. Triacs are a useful alternative to relays for switching ac line voltages. The 2N6073A shown in Figure 21  is rated to handle 4A (rms).

Controlling the 2N6073A Triac \nHIGH CURRENT SWITCHING  \nInternal dissipation due to large loads on the TMP01 outputs \ncauses some temperature error due to self-heating. External \ntransistors remove the load from the TMP01, so that virtually no power is dissipated in the internal transistors and no self-heating occurs. Figure 22  through Figure 24  show a few \nexamples using external transistors. The simplest case, using a \nsingle transistor on the output to invert the output signal is \nshown in Figure 22 . When the open collector of the TMP01 \nturns on and pulls the output down, the external transistor Q1 base is pulled low, turning off the transistor. Another transistor can be added to reinvert the signal as shown in Figure 23 . Now, \nwhen the output of the TMP01 is pulled down, the first transis-tor, Q1, turns off and its collector goes high, which turns Q2 on, \npulling its collector low.  Figure 23.

E | Page 13 of 20 BUFFERING THE TEMPERATURE OUTPUT PIN \nThe VPTAT sensor output is a low impedance dc output voltage \nwith a 5 mV/K temperature coefficient, that is useful in multiple \nmeasurement and control applications. In many applications, this voltage needs to be transmitted to a central location for \nprocessing. The buffered VPTAT voltage output is capable of \n500 μA drive into 50 pF (maximum).  \nConsider external amplifiers for interfacing VPTAT to external \ncircuitry to ensure accuracy, and to minimize loading which could create dissipation-induced temperature sensing errors. \nAn excellent general-purpose buffer circuit using the OP177 is \nshown in Figure 25 . It is capable of driving over 10 mA, and \nremains stable under capacitive loads of up to 0.1 μF. Other \ninterfacing ideas are also provided in this section.  \nDIFFERENTIAL TRANSMITTER  \nIn noisy industrial environments, it is difficult to send an \naccurate analog signal over a significant distance. However,  \nby sending the signal differentially on a wire pair, these errors can be significantly reduced. Because the noise is picked up equally on both wires, a receiver with high common-mode input rejection can be used to cancel out the noise very effec-\ntively at the receiving end. Figure 26  shows two amplifiers used \nto send the signal differentially, and an excellent differential \nreceiver, the AMP03, which features a common-mode rejection \nratio of 95 dB at dc and very low input and drift errors.

Buffer VPTAT to Handle Difficult Loads  \n4 mA TO 20 mA CURRENT LOOP  \nAnother common method of transmitting a signal over long \ndistances is to use a 4 mA to 20 mA loop, as shown in Figure 27 . \nAn advantage of using a 4 mA to 20 mA loop is that the \naccuracy of a current loop is not compromised by voltage drops across the line. One requirement of 4 mA to 20 mA circuits is \nthat the remote end must receive all of its power from the loop, \nmeaning that the circuit must consume less than 4 mA.  \nOperating from 5 V , the quiescent current of the TMP01 is \n500 μA maximum, and the OP90s is 20 μA maximum, totaling \nless than 4 mA. Although not shown, the open collector outputs \nand temperature setting pins can be connected to do any local \ncontrol of switching.  \nTEMPERATURE\nSENSOR AND\nVOLTAGE\nREFERENCEVREF VPTAT\n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5HYSTERESIS\nGENERATORWINDOW\nCOMPARATOR\nTMP011/2\nOP297\n1/2\nOP297AMP03R1\nR2\nR3\nVPTAT\nVOUTV+\n50Ω10kΩ\n10kΩ\n50Ω\nV–V+\n10kΩ\n00333-026 \nFigure 26.

Thus, the ratio of  \nR5 over R2 must give a variation of I OUT from 4 mA to 20 mA  \nas VPTAT varies from 1.165 V at −40°C to 1.79 V at +85°C.  The absolute value of the resistors is not important, only the ratio. For convenience, 100 kΩ is chosen for R5. Once R2 is \ncalculated, the value of R3 and R1 is determined by substituting \n4 mA for I\nOUT and 1.165 V for VPTAT and solving. The final values are shown in the circuit. The OP90 is chosen for this circuit because of its ability to operate on a single supply and its high accuracy. For initial accuracy, a 10 kΩ trim potentiometer can be included in series with R3, and the value of R3 lowered \nto 95 kΩ. The potentiometer should be adjusted to produce an \noutput current of 12.3 mA at 25°C.  \nTEMPERATURE-TO-FREQU ENCY CONVERTER  \nAnother common method of transmitting analog information  \nis to convert a voltage to the frequency domain. This is easily \ndone with any of the low cost monolithic voltage-to-frequency converters (VFCs) available, which feature a robust, open-collector digital output. A digital signal is immune to noise  and voltage drops because the only important information is  \nthe frequency. As long as the conversions between temperature \nand frequency are done accurately, the temperature data can be \nsuccessfully transmitted.  \nA simple circuit to do this combines the TMP01 with an AD654 \nVFC, as shown in Figure 28 . The AD654 outputs a square wave \nthat is proportional to the dc input voltage according to the \nfollowing equation:  \nTIN\nOUTC R RVF) 2 1 ( 10+=  \nBy simply connecting the VPTAT output to the input of the \nAD654, the 5 mV/°C temperature coefficient gives a sensitivity of 25 Hz/°C, centered around 7.5 kHz at 25°C. The trimming resistor R2 is needed to calibrate the absolute accuracy of the AD654. For more information on that part, consult the AD654 \ndata sheet. Finally, the AD650 ca n be used to accurately convert \nthe frequency back to a dc voltage on the receiving end.  \nTEMPERATURE\nSENSOR AND\nVOLTAGE\nREFERENCEVREF VPTAT\nVPTAT1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5HYSTERESIS\nGENERATORWINDOW\nCOMPARATOR\nTMP01R1\nR2\nR3V+\nFOUTV+V+\n4\n31\n2 5AD654\nOSC7 8 6\nR1\n1.8kΩ\nR2\n500Ω5kΩCT\n0.1µF\n00333-028 \nFigure 28.

Isolation Amplifier \nISOLATION AMPLIFIER  \nIn many industrial applications, the sensor is located in an envi-\nronment that needs to be electrically isolated from the central \nprocessing area. Figure 29  shows a simple circuit that uses an  \n8-pin optoisolator (IL300XC) that can operate across a 5,000 V barrier. IC1 (an OP290 single-supply amplifier) is used to drive the LED connected between Pin 1 and Pin 2. The feedback actually comes from the photodiode connected from Pin 3 to Pin 4. The OP290 drives the LED such that there is enough current generated in the photodiode to exactly equal the current \nderived from the VPTAT voltage across the 470 kΩ resistor.  \nOn the receiving end, an OP90 converts the current from the \nsecond photodiode to a voltage through its feedback resistor R2.  \nNote that the other amplifier in the dual OP290 is used to buffer \nthe 2.5 V reference voltage of the TMP01 for an accurate, low drift LED bias level without affecting the programmed hyster-esis current. A REF43 (a precision 2.5 V reference) provides an accurate bias level at the receiving end.  \nTo understand this circuit, it helps to examine the overall \nequation for the output voltage. First, the current (I1) in the \nphotodiode is set by \nkΩ470V 5 . 2\n1VPTATI−=  \nNote that the IL300XC has a gain of 0.73 (typical) with a \nminimum and maximum of 0.693 and 0.769, respectively. Because this is less than 1.0, R2 must be larger than R1 to \nachieve overall unity gain. To show this, the full equation is  \n= − =2 2 5 . 2 R I V VOUT\nVPTATVPTAT VV⎜⎜\n⎝⎛−−kΩ4705 . 27 . 0 5 . 2 =⎟⎟\n⎠⎞\nkΩ 644  \nA trim is included for R2 to correct for the initial gain accuracy \nof the IL300XC. To perform this trim, simply adjust for an output voltage equal to VPTAT at any particular temperature. For example, at room temperature, VPTAT = 1.49 V , so adjust R2 until V\nOUT = 1.49 V as well. Both the REF43 and the OP90 \noperate from a single supply, and contribute no significant error \ndue to drift.  \nIn order to avoid the accuracy trim, and to reduce board space, \ncomplete isolation amplifiers are available, such as the high \naccuracy AD202.  \nOUT-OF-RANGE WARNING  \nBy connecting the two open-collector outputs of the TMP01 \ntogether into a wired-OR configuration, a temperature out- \nof-range warning signal is generated. This can be useful in sensitive equipment calibrated to work over a limited temper-ature range.  \nR1, R2, and R3 in Figure 30  are chosen to give a temperature \nrange of 10°C around room temperature (25°C). Thus, if the \ntemperature in the equipment falls below 15°C or rises above \n35°C, the OVER\n or UNDER output, respectively, goes low and \nturns the LED on. The LED may be replaced with a simple pull-\nup resistor to give a logic output for controlling the instrument, \nor any of the switching devices discussed above can be used.  \nTEMPERATURE\nSENSOR AND\nVOLTAGE\nREFERENCEVREF VPTAT\nVPTATLED\n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5HYSTERESIS\nGENERATORWINDOW\nCOMPARATOR\nTMP01R1\n47.5kΩ\nR2\n4.99kΩ\nR3\n71.5kΩV+\n200Ω\n00333-030 \nFigure 30.

Circuit errors will be due prima-rily to the inaccuracies of the resistor values. Using 1% resistors, \nthe observed error was less than 10 mV , or 1°C. The 10 pF \nfeedback capacitor helps to ensure against oscillations.
