DS20001667G-page  3MCP2551\n1.0 DEVICE OVERVIEW\nThe MCP2551 is a high-speed CAN, fault-tolerant \ndevice that serves as the interface between a CAN \nprotocol controller and the physical bus. The MCP2551device provides differential transmit and receive \ncapability for the CAN protocol controller, and is fully \ncompatible with the ISO-11898 standard, including 24V requirements. It will operate at speeds of up to 1\n Mb/s.\nTypically, each node in a CAN system must have a \ndevice to convert the digital signals generated by a \nCAN controller to signals suitable for transmission over the bus cabling (differential output). It also provides a \nbuffer between the CAN controller and the high-voltage \nspikes that can be generated on the CAN bus by outside sources (EMI, ESD, electrical transients, etc.).\n1.1 Transmitter Function\nThe CAN bus has two states: Dominant and \nRecessive. A Dominant state occurs when the \ndifferential voltage between CANH and CANL is greater than a defined voltage (e.g.,1.2V). A Recessive \nstate occurs when the differential voltage is less than a \ndefined voltage (typically 0V). The Dominant and Recessive states correspond to the Low and High state \nof the TXD input pin, respectively. However, a \nDominant state initiated by another CAN node will override a Recessive state on the CAN bus.\n1.1.1 MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NODES\nThe MCP2551 CAN outputs will drive a minimum load \nof 45\uf057, allowing a maximum of 112  nodes to be \nconnected (given a minimum differential input resistance of 20\n k\uf057 and a nominal termination resistor \nvalue of 120 \uf057\uf029\uf02e\n1.2 Receiver Function\nThe RXD output pin reflects the differential bus voltage \nbetween CANH and CANL. The Low and High states of the RXD output pin correspond to the Dominant and \nRecessive states of the CAN bus, respectively.\n1.3 Internal Protection\nCANH and CANL are protected against battery short \ncircuits and electrical transients that can occur on the CAN bus. This feature prevents destruction of the \ntransmitter output stage during such a fault condition.\nThe device is further protected from excessive current \nloading by thermal shutdown circuitry that disables the output drivers when the junction temperature exceeds \na nominal limit of 165°C. All other parts of the chip \nremain operational, and the chip temperature is low\n-\nered due to the decreased power dissipation in the \ntransmitter outputs. This protection is essential to \nprotect against bus line short-circuit-induced damage.1.4 Operating Modes\nThe R S pin allows three modes of operation to be \nselected:\n•H i g h - S p e e d\n• Slope-Control\n• Standby\nThese modes are summarized in Table  1-1.\nWhen in High-Speed or Slope-Control mode, the \ndrivers for the CANH and CANL signals are internally \nregulated to provide controlled symmetry in order to minimize EMI emissions.\nAdditionally, the slope of the signal transitions on \nCANH and CANL can be controlled with a resistor \nconnected from pin 8 (R S) to ground. The slope must \nbe proportional to the current output at R S, which will \nfurther reduce EMI emissions.\n1.4.1 HIGH-SPEED\nHigh-Speed mode is selected by connecting the R S pin \nto V SS. In this mode, the transmitter output drivers have \nfast output rise and fall times to support high-speed \nCAN bus rates.\n1.4.2 SLOPE-CONTROL\nSlope-Control mode further reduces EMI by limiting the \nrise and fall times of CANH and CANL. The slope, or slew rate (SR), is controlled by connecting an external \nresistor (R\nEXT) between R S and V OL (usually ground). \nThe slope is proportional to the current output at the R S\npin. Since the current is primarily determined by the \nslope-control resistance value R EXT, a certain slew rate \nis achieved by applying a specific resistance. \nFigure  1-1 illustrates typical slew rate values as a \nfunction of the slope-control resistance value. \n1.4.3 STANDBY MODE\nThe device may be placed in Standby or SLEEP mode by applying a high-level to the R\nS pin. In SLEEP mode, \nthe transmitter is switched off and the receiver operates \nat a lower current. The receive pin on the controller side \n(RXD) is still functional, but will operate at a slower rate. The attached microcontroller can monitor RXD for \nCAN bus activity and place the transceiver into normal \noperation via the R\nS pin (at higher bus rates, the first \nCAN message may be lost).\nMCP2551\nDS20001667G-page  4 \uf0e3 2001-2016 Microchip Technology Inc.TABLE 1-1: MODES OF OPERATION  \nTABLE 1-2: TRANSCEIVER TRUTH TABLE  \nFIGURE 1-1: SLEW RATE VS.

DS20001667G-page  5MCP2551\n1.5 TXD Permanent Dominant      \nDetection \nIf the MCP2551 detects an extended Low state on the \nTXD input, it will disable the CANH and CANL output \ndrivers in order to prevent the corruption of data on the CAN bus. The drivers are disabled if TXD is Low for \nmore than 1.25\n ms (minimum). This implies a \nmaximum bit time of 62.5  µs (16  kb/s bus rate), \nallowing up to 20 consecutive transmitted Dominant \nbits during a multiple bit error and error frame scenario. \nThe drivers remain disabled as long as TXD remains Low. A rising edge on TXD will reset the timer logic and \nenable the CANH and CANL output drivers.\n1.6 Power-on Reset\nWhen the device is powered on, CANH and CANL \nremain in a high-impedance state until V DD reaches the \nvoltage level V PORH . In addition, CANH and CANL will \nremain in a high-impedance state if TXD is Low when \nVDD reaches V PORH . CANH and CANL will become \nactive only after TXD is asserted High. Once powered \non, CANH and CANL will enter a high-impedance state \nif the voltage level at V DD falls below V PORL , providing \nvoltage brown-out protection during normal operation.\n1.7 Pin Descriptions\nThe 8-pin pinout is listed in Table  1-3. \nTABLE 1-3: MCP2551 PINOUT  1.7.1 TRANSMITTER DATA INPUT (TXD)\nTXD is a TTL-compatible input pin. The data on this pin is driven out on the CANH and CANL differential output pins. It is usually connected to the transmitter data \noutput of the CAN controller device. When TXD is low, \nCANH and CANL are in the Dominant state. When TXD is high, CANH and CANL are in the Recessive state, \nprovided that another CAN node is not driving the CAN \nbus with a Dominant state. TXD has an internal pull-up resistor (nominal 25\n k\uf057 to V DD).\n1.7.2 GROUND SUPPLY (V SS)\nGround supply pin.\n1.7.3 SUPPLY VOLTAGE (VDD)\nPositive supply voltage pin.\n1.7.4 RECEIVER DATA OUTPUT (RXD)\nRXD is a CMOS-compatible output that drives high or \nlow depending on the differential signals on the CANH \nand CANL pins and is usually connected to the receiver data input of the CAN controller device. RXD is High \nwhen the CAN bus is Recessive and Low in the \nDominant state.\n1.7.5 REFERENCE VOLTAGE (V REF)\nReference Voltage Output (defined as V DD/2). \n1.7.6 CAN LOW (CANL)\nThe CANL output drives the low side of the CAN differential bus. This pin is also tied internally to the \nreceive input comparator.\n1.7.7 CAN HIGH (CANH)\nThe CANH output drives the high side of the CAN \ndifferential bus. This pin is also tied internally to the receive input comparator.\n1.7.8 SLOPE RESISTOR INPUT (R S)\nThe R S pin is used to select High-Speed, Slope-Control \nor Standby modes via an external biasing resistor.
