AD8363  Block Diagram \n \n \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8363 is a true rms responding power detector that can \nbe directly driven with a single-ended 50 Ω source. This feature \nmakes the AD8363 frequency versatile by eliminating the need \nfor a balun or any other form of external input tuning for operation \nup to 6 GHz. \nThe AD8363 provides an accurate power measurement, \nindependent of waveform, for a variety of high frequency \ncommunication and instrumentation systems. Requiring only  a single supply of 5 V and a few capacitors, it is easy to use and \nprovides high measurement accuracy. The AD8363 can operate \nfrom arbitrarily low frequencies to 6 GHz and can accept inputs \nthat have rms values from less than −50 dBm to at least 0 dBm, with large crest factors exceeding the requirements for accurate measurement of WiMAX, CDMA, W-CDMA, TD-SCDMA, \nmulticarrier GSM, and LTE signals. \nThe AD8363 can determine the true power of a high frequency \nsignal having a complex low frequency modulation envelope, or \nit can be used as a simple low frequency rms voltmeter. The high-pass corner generated by its internal offset-nulling loop can be \nlowered by a capacitor added on the CHPF pin. Used as a power measurement device, VOUT is connected to \nVSET. The output is then proportional to the logarithm of the \nrms value of the input. The reading is presented directly in \ndecibels and is conveniently scaled to 52 mV/dB, or approximately 1 V per decade; however, other slopes are easily arranged. In controller mode, the voltage applied to VSET determines the power level required at the input to null the deviation from the \nsetpoint. The output buffer can provide high load currents. \nThe AD8363 has 1.5 mW power consumption when powered \ndown by a logic high applied to the TCM2/PWDN pin. It powers \nup within about 30 μs to its nominal operating current of 60 mA at 25°C. The AD8363 is available in a 4 mm × 4 mm 16-lead LFCSP \nfor operation over the −40°C to +125°C temperature range. \nA fully populated RoHS compliant evaluation board is also \navailable. \n \n \nAD8363 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

If the \nshutdown function is not used, t his pin can be connected to the VREF pin throug h a voltage \ndivider.  See Figure 39  \n2 CHPF  Connect this pin to VPOS via a capacitor to determi ne the −3 dB point of the input signal high-\npass filter.  Only a dd a capacitor when operating at frequencies below 10 MHz . See Figure 48  \n3, 10  VPOS  Sup ply for the D evice. Connect th ese pins to a 5 V power supply.  Pin 3 and Pin 10 are not  internally  \nconnected ; therefore,  both must connect to the source.  Not \napplicable  \n4, 9 COMM  System  Common Connection . Connect these  pins via low impedance to system common.  Not \napplicable  \n5 CLPF  Connection for Loop Filter Integrati on (Averaging) Capacitor. Connect a ground -referenced \ncapacitor  to this pin. A resistor can  be connected in series with this capacitor to improve loop \nstability and response time.  Minimum C LPF value is 390 pF. See Figure 41  \n6 VOUT  Output Pin in Measurement Mode ( Error Amplifier O utput). In measurement mode, this pin is \nconnected to VSET . This pin can be used to drive a gain control when the device is used in \ncontroller mode.  See Figure 41  \n7 VSET  The voltage applied to this pin sets the decibel value of the required RF input voltage that results  \nin zero current flow in the loop integrating capacitor pin, CLPF . This pin  controls the variable gain  \namplifier ( VGA ) gain such  that a 50 mV change in VSET reduces the gain by approximately 1  dB. See Figure 40  \n8 TEMP  Temperature Sensor Output.  See Figure 35  \n11 VREF  General -Purpose Reference Voltage O utput of 2.3 V. See Figure 36  \n12 VTGT  The v oltage applied to this pin determines the target power at the input of the RF squaring circuit.  The \nintercept voltage is proportional to the voltage applied to this pin . The use of a lower target  \nvoltage  increases the crest factor capacity; however, this may a ffect the system loop response.  See Figure 42  \n13 NC No Connect.  Not \napplicable  \n14 INHI This is the RF input pin for freque ncies up to and including 2.6  GHz . The RF input signal is normally  \nac-coupled  to this pin through a coupling  capacitor.  See Figure 34  \n15 INLO  This is the RF input pin for frequencies above  2.6 GHz . The RF input si gnal is normally ac -coupled \nto this pin  through a coupling  capacitor.  See Figure 34  \n16 TCM1  This pin is  used to  adjust the intercept temperature compensation . Connect this pin to VREF \nthrough a voltage divider or to an external dc source.  See Figure 38  \n EPAD  Exposed Pad. The exposed pad is the system common connection  and it must  have both a good \nthermal and good electrical connection to ground.  Not applicable  \nRev.

B | Page 14 of 29 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe computational core of the AD8363 is a high performance \nAGC loop. As shown in Figure 33, the AGC loop comprises a \nwide bandwidth variable gain amplifier (VGA), square law detectors, an amplitude target circuit, and an output driver. For \na more detailed description of the functional blocks, see the \nAD8362 data sheet. \nThe nomenclature used in this data sheet to distinguish \nbetween a pin name and the signal on that pin is as follows: \n\uf0b7 The pin name is all uppercase (for example, VPOS, \nCOMM, and VOUT). \n\uf0b7 The signal name or a value associated with that pin is the pin mnemonic with a partial subscript (for example, C\nLPF, \nCHPF, and V OUT). \nSQUARE LAW DETECTOR AND AMPLITUDE TARGET \nThe VGA gain has the form \nGSET = GO exp(− VSET/VGNS) (1) \nwhere:  G\nO is the basic fixed gain. \nVGNS is a scaling voltage that defines the gain slope (the decibel \nchange per voltage). The gain decreases with increasing V SET. \nThe VGA output is \nVSIG = GSET × RF IN = GO × RF IN exp(VSET/VGNS) (2) \nwhere RF IN is the ac voltage applied to the input terminals of the \nAD8363. The output of the VGA, V SIG, is applied to a wideband square \nlaw detector. The detector provides the true rms response of the \nRF input signal, independent of waveform. The detector output, \nISQR, is a fluctuating current with positive mean value. The \ndifference between I SQR and an internally generated current, \nITGT, is integrated by C F and the external capacitor attached to \nthe CLPF pin at the summing node. C F is an on-chip 25 pF filter \ncapacitor, and C LPF, the external capacitance connected to the \nCLPF pin, can be used to arbitrarily increase the averaging time while trading off with the response time. When the AGC loop is \nat equilibrium \nMean (I\nSQR) = I TGT (3) \nThis equilibrium occurs only when \nMean (VSIG2) = VTGT2 (4) \nwhere VTGT is the voltage presented at the VTGT pin. This pin \ncan conveniently be connected to the VREF pin through a voltage \ndivider to establish a target rms voltage V ATG of ~70 mV rms, when \nVTGT = 1.4 V . \nBecause the square law detectors are electrically identical and well matched, process and temperature dependent variations \nare effectively cancelled. \n \nTCM1\nTCM2/PWDN\nBAND GAP\nREFERENCECOMMVOUT\nTEMP (1.4V)\nVREF (2.3V)ISQR ITGT\nX2X2\nGSET\nCH\n(INTERNAL)CHPF\n(EXTERNAL)CLPF\n(EXTERNAL)CF\n(INTERNAL)VSIG\nVGASUMMING\nNODE\nVSET\nCHPFVPOSINHI\nINLO\nTEMPERATURE COMPENSATION\nAND BIAS\nTEMPERATURE\nSENSORVTGT\nCLPFVATG =VTGT\n20\n07368-076 \nFigure 33.

B | Page 15 of 29 By forcing the previous identity through varying the VGA setpoint, \nit is apparent that \nRMS (VSIG) = √( Mean (VSIG2)) = √(V ATG2) = VATG (5) \nSubstituting the value of V SIG from Equation 2 results in \nRMS (G0 × RF IN exp(−V SET/VGNS)) = VATG  (6) \nWhen connected as a measurement device, VSET = VOUT. Solving \nfor VOUT as a function of RF IN \nVOUT = VSLOPE × log 10(RMS (RF IN)/VZ) (7) \nwhere: \nVSLOPE is 1 V/decade (or 50 mV/dB).  \nVZ is the intercept voltage. \nWhen RMS(RF IN) = V Z, because log 10(1) = 0, this implies that \nVOUT = 0 V , making the intercept the input that forces V OUT = 0 V . \nVZ has been fixed to approximately 280 μV (approximately \n−58 dBm, referred to 50 Ω) with a CW signal at 100 MHz.  \nIn reality, the AD8363 does not respond to signals less than \n~−56 dBm. This means that the intercept is an extrapolated \nvalue outside the operating range of the device. \nIf desired, the effective value of V SLOPE can be altered by using  \na resistor divider between VOUT and VSET. (Refer to the \nOutput Voltage Scaling section for more information.) \nIn most applications, the AGC loop is closed through the \nsetpoint interface and the VSET pin. In measurement mode, VOUT is directly connected to VSET. (See the Measurement \nMode Basic Connections section for more information.) In \ncontroller mode, a control voltage is applied to VSET and the VOUT pin typically drives the control input of an amplification or attenuation system. In this case, the voltage at the VSET pin forces a signal amplitude at the RF inputs of the AD8363 that \nbalances the system through feedback. (See the Controller \nMode Basic Connections section for more information.) \nRF INPUT INTERFACE  \nFigure 34 shows the connections of the RF inputs within \nthe AD8363. The input impedance is set primarily by an internal \n50 Ω resistor connected between INHI and INLO. A dc level of \napproximately half the supply voltage on each pin is established internally. Either the INHI pin or the INLO pin can be used as the single-ended RF input pin. (See the Choice of RF Input Pin \nsection.) If the dc levels at these pins are disturbed, performance \nis compromised; therefore, signal coupling capacitors must be connected from the input signal to INHI and INLO. The input signal high-pass corner formed by the coupling capacitors and \nthe internal resistances is \nf\nHIGH-PASS  = 1/(2 × π × 50 × C) (8) \nwhere C is in farads and f HIGH-PASS  is in hertz. The input coupling \ncapacitors must be large enough in value to pass the input signal \nfrequency of interest. The other input pin should be RF ac-coupled \nto common (ground). \n07368-039ESD ESD ESD ESD ESD ESD\nESD ESD ESD ESD ESD ESDESD\nESD ESDESD ESD2.5kΩ 2.5kΩ\n50ΩVBIAS VPOS\nINHI INLO\n \nFigure 34. RF Inputs Simplified Schematic \nExtensive ESD protection is employed on the RF inputs, which \nlimits the maximum possible input amplitude to the AD8363. \nCHOICE OF RF INPUT PIN \nThe dynamic range of the AD8363 can be optimized by choosing \nthe correct RF input pin for the intended frequency of operation. \nUsing INHI (Pin 14), users can obtain the best dynamic range at \nfrequencies up to 2.6 GHz. Above 2.6 GHz, it is recommended \nthat INLO (Pin 15) be used. At 2.6 GHz, the performance obtained \nat the two inputs is approximately equal. \nThe AD8363 was designed with a single-ended RF drive in \nmind. A balun can be used to drive INHI and INLO differentially, \nbut it is not necessary, and it does not result in improved \ndynamic range. \nSMALL SIGNAL LOOP RESPONSE \nThe AD8363 uses a VGA in a loop to force a squared RF signal \nto be equal to a squared dc voltage. This nonlinear loop can be \nsimplified and solved for a small signal loop response. The low-\npass corner pole is given by \nFreq LP ≈ 1.83 × ITGT/(CLPF) (9) \nwhere: \nITGT is in amperes. \nCLPF is in farads. \nFreq LP is in hertz. \nITGT is derived from V TGT; however, I TGT is a squared value of \nVTGT multiplied by a transresistance, namely \nITGT = gm × VTGT2 (10) \ngm is approximately 18.9 μs, so with V TGT equal to the typically \nrecommended 1.4 V , I TGT is approximately 37 μA. The value of \nthis current varies with temperature; therefore, the small signal pole varies with temperature. However, because the RF squaring circuit and dc squaring circuit track with temperature, there is no \ntemperature variation contribution to the absolute value of V\nOUT. \nFor CW signals, \nFreq LP ≈ 67.7 × 10−6/(CLPF) (11) \nHowever, signals with large crest factors include low \npseudorandom frequency content that either needs to be \nfiltered out or sampled and averaged out. See the Choosing a \nValue for CLPF section for more information. \nAD8363 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

The \noutput is capable of sourcing 4 mA and sinking 50 μA maximum at temperatures at or above 25°C. If additional current sink capability \nis desired, an external resistor can be connected between the \nTEMP and COMM pins.

An external resistor can be connected between the VREF and COMM pins to provide additional current sink capability. The voltage on this pin can be used to drive the TCM1, TCM2/PWDN, and VTGT pins, if desired. \n07368-042INTERNAL\nVOLTAGE\n16kΩVREFVPOS\nCOMM \nFigure 36. VREF Interface Simplified Schematic \nTEMPERATURE COMPENSATION INTERFACE \nProprietary techniques are used to maximize the temperature \nstability of the AD8363. For optimal performance, the output \ntemperature drift must be compensated for using the TCM1 and TCM2/PWDN pins. The absolute value of compensation varies \nwith frequency and V\nTGT. Table 4 shows the recommended voltages \nfor the TCM1 and TCM2/PWDN pins to maintain the best temperature drift error over the rated temperature range (−40°C < T\nA < 85°C) when driven single-ended and using a V TGT = 1.4 V . \nTable 4.

The optimal voltages for \nVTCM1 and V TCM2 to achieve minimum temperature drift at a given \npower and frequency are the values of V TCM1 and V TCM2 where \nVOUT has minimum movement. See the AD8364  and ADL5513  \ndata sheets for more information. \nVar ying V TCM1 and V TCM2 has only a very slight effect on V OUT at \ndevice temperatures near 25°C; however, the compensation circuit \nhas more and more effect, and is more and more necessary for best temperature drift performance, as the temperature departs \nfarther from 25°C. \nFigure 37 shows the effect on temperature drift performance at \n25°C and 85°C as V\nTCM1 is varied but V TCM2 is held constant at 0.6 V . \n3\n2\n1\n0\n–1\n–2–3\n–60 –50 –40 –30 –20 –10 0 10\nRF\nIN (dBm)ERROR (dB)\n07368-05025°C\n85°CVTCM1  = 0.62V\nVTCM1  = 0.42V\n \nFigure 37. Error vs. Input Amplitude over Stepped V TCM1  Values,  \n25oC and 85oC, 2.14 GHz, V TCM2  = 0.6 V \nTCM1 primarily adjusts the intercept of the AD8363 at \ntemperature. In this way, TCM1 can be thought of as a coarse \nadjustment to the compensation. Conversely, TCM2 performs a \nfine adjustment. For this reason, it is advised that when searching for compensation with V\nTCM1 and V TCM2, that V TCM1 be adjusted \nfirst, and when best performance is found, V TCM2 can then be \nadjusted for optimization. \nIt is evident from Figure 37 that the temperature compensation \ncircuit can be used to adjust for the lowest drift at any input \namplitude of choice. Though not shown in Figure 37, a similar \nanalysis can simultaneously be performed at −40°C, or any \nother temperature within the operating range of the AD8363. \nPerformance varies slightly from device to device; therefore, \noptimal V TCM1 and V TCM2 values must be arrived at statistically \nData Sheet AD8363\n \nRev. B | Page 17 of 29 over a population of devices to be useful in mass production \napplications. \nThe TCM1 and TCM2 pins have high input impedances, \napproximately 5 kΩ and 500 kΩ, respectively, and can be conveniently driven from an external source or from a fraction of VREF by using a resistor divider. VREF does change slightly \nwith temperature and RF input amplitude (see Figure 32 and \nFigure 29); however, the amount of change is unlikely to result in a significant effect on the final temperature stability of the RF \nmeasurement system. \nFigure 38 shows a simplified schematic representation of TCM1. \nSee the Power-Down Interface section for the TCM2 interface. \n07368-0433kΩ3kΩESD\nESD\nESDVPOS\nCOMMTCM1\n \nFigure 38. TCM1 Interface Simplified Schematic \nPOWER-DOWN INTERFACE \nThe quiescent and disabled currents for the AD8363 at 25°C are \napproximately 60 mA and 300 μA, respectively. The dual function \npin, TCM2/PWDN, is connected to a temperature compensation circuit as well as a power-down circuit. Typically, when PWDN is greater than V\nPOS − 0.1 V , the device is fully powered down. \nFigure 28 shows this characteristic as a function of V PWDN . Note \nthat because of the design of this section of the AD8363, as \nVTCM2 passes through a narrow range at ~4.5 V (or ~V POS − 0.5 V), \nthe TCM2/PWDN pin sinks approximately 750 μA. The source used to disable the AD8363 must have a sufficiently high current \ncapability for this reason. Figure 23 shows the typical response \ntimes for various RF input levels. The output reaches within 0.1 dB \nof its steady-state value in approximately 35 μs; however, the refer-ence voltage is available to full accuracy in a much shorter time. This wake-up response varies depending on the input coupling \nand the capacitances, C\nHPF and C LPF. \n07368-044TCM2/\nPWDN\nCOMMVPOS\n200Ω 200Ω7kΩ 7kΩ\nVREF\nINTERCEPT\nTEMPERATURE\nCOMPENSATION200ΩPOWER-UPCIRCUITSHUTDOWN\nCIRCUITESD\nESDESD\n \nFigure 39.

With 1.4 V on the VTGT pin, the rms voltage that must be provided by the VGA to balance the \nAGC feedback loop is 1.4 V × 0.05 = 70 mV rms. Most of the \ncharacterization information in this data sheet was collected at V\nTGT = 1.4 V . Voltages higher and lower than this can be used; \nhowever, doing so increases or decreases the gain at the internal squaring cell, which results in a corresponding increase or decrease in intercept. This in turn affects the sensitivity and the \nusable measurement range. Because the gain of the squaring  \ncell varies with temperature, oscillations or a loss in measurement \nrange can result. For these reasons, do not reduce V\nTGT below 1.3 V . \n07368-047VTGT 50kΩ\n50kΩ\n10kΩESD\nESDESDVPOS\nCOMMg × X2\nITGT\n \nFigure 42. VTGT Interface Simplified Schematic MEASUREMENT MODE BASIC CONNECTIONS \nThe AD8363 requires a single supply of nominally 5 V . The \nsupply is connected to the two supply pins, VPOS. Decouple  \nthe pins using two capacitors with values equal or similar to those shown in Figure 43. These capacitors must provide a low \nimpedance over the full frequency range of the input, and they \nshould be placed as close as possible to the VPOS pins. Use two different capacitor values in parallel to provide a broadband ac short to ground. \nInput signals can be applied differentially or single-ended; however, \nin both cases, the input impedance is 50 Ω. Most performance information in this data sheet was derived with a single-ended drive. The optimal measurement range is achieved using a single-\nended drive on the INHI pin at frequencies below 2.6 GHz (as \nshown in Figure 43), and likewise, optimal performance is achieved using the INLO pin above 2.6 GHz (similar to Figure 43; except INLO is ac-coupled to the input and INHI is ac-coupled \nto ground). \nThe AD8363 is placed in measurement mode by connecting \nVOUT to VSET. This closes the AGC loop within the device \nwith V\nOUT representing the VGA control voltage, which is \nrequired to present the correct rms voltage at the input of the \ninternal square law detector. \nTEMP\n8\n7\n6\n5VOUT\nTCM113\n14\n15\n16VREFVPOS2\n12 11 10 9\n1234\nTCM2/PWDN\nVPOS1NC\nINHIINLOTCM1TEMP\nVSET\nVOUT\nCLPFVTGT\nVREF\nVPOS\nCOMMTCM2/PWDNCHPF\nVPOS\nCOMMAD8363\nDUT1\n07368-062C12\n0.1µFC10\n0.1µFC7\n0.1µF\nC5\n100pF\nLOW FREQUENCY INPUT\nC9\n0.1µF\nC4\n100pF\nC13\n0.1µFC3\nOPENPADDLE\nAGNDR11\n1.4kΩR10\n845Ω\n \nFigure 43.

As the input level varies from −55 dBm to +0 dBm, the output voltage varies from ~0 V to ~3.1 V . \nBecause slope and intercept vary from device to device, board-\nlevel calibration must be performed to achieve high accuracy. \nThe equation for the idealized output voltage can be written as \nV\nOUT(IDEAL)  = Slope × ( PIN − Intercept ) (12) \nwhere: \nSlope  is the change in output voltage divided by the change in \ninput power (dB). \n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n04\n3\n2\n1\n0\n–1\n–2\n–3\n–4\n–60 –50 –40 –30 –20 –10 0 10\nPIN (dBm)VOUT (V)\nERROR (dB)07368-144 \nFigure 44. 1.9 GHz Transfer Function and Linearity Error using a Two-Point \nCalibration (Calibration Points −20 dBm and −40 dBm) \nIntercept  is the calculated input power level at which the output \nvoltage would equal 0 V (note that Intercept  is an extrapolated \ntheoretical value not a measured value). \nIn general, calibration, which establishes the Slope  and Intercept,  \nis performed during equipment manufacture by applying two  \nor more known signal levels to the input of the AD8363 and \nmeasuring the corresponding output voltages. The calibration \npoints are generally chosen within the linear-in-dB operating \nrange of the device. \nWith a two-point calibration, the slope and intercept are \ncalculated as follows: \nSlope  = (VOUT1 − VOUT2)/(PIN1 − PIN2) (13) \nIntercept  = PIN1 − (V OUT1/Slope ) (14) \nAfter the slope and intercept are calculated and stored in non-\nvolatile memory during equipment calibration, an equation can \nbe used to calculate an unknown input power based on the \noutput voltage of the detector. \nPIN (Unknown) = (V OUT1(MEASURED) /Slope ) + Intercept  (15) \nThe log conformance error is the difference between this straight line and the actual performance of the detector. \nError  (dB) = (V\nOUT (MEASURED ) − VOUT (IDEAL) )/Slope  (16) Figure 44 includes a plot of this error when using a two-point \ncalibration (calibration points are −20 dBm and −40 dBm). The \nerror at the calibration points is equal to 0 by definition. \nThe residual nonlinearity of the transfer function that is \napparent in the two-point calibration error plot can be reduced by increasing the number of calibration points. Figure 45 shows \nthe post-calibration error plots for three-point calibration. With \na multipoint calibration, the transfer function is segmented, with each segment having its own slope and intercept. During calibration, multiple known power levels are applied, and multiple voltages are measured. When the equipment is in \noperation, the measured voltage from the detector is first used \nto determine which of the stored slope and intercept calibration coefficients are to be used. Then the unknown power level is calculated by inserting the appropriate slope and intercept into \nEquation 15. \nFigure 45 shows the output voltage and error at 25°C and over \ntemperature when a three-point calibration is used (calibration \npoints are 0 dBm, −10 dBm and −40 dBm).

V OUT and Log Conformance Error vs. Input Amplitude at 2.14 GHz, \n−40°C to +125°C \nOUTPUT VOLTAGE SCALING \nThe output voltage range of the AD8363 (nominally 0 V to \n3.5 V) can be easily increased or decreased. There are a number \nof situations where adjustment of the output scaling makes \nsense. For example, if the AD8363 is driving an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a 0 V to 5 V input range, it makes sense to increase the detector’s nominal maximum output voltage of 3.5 V so that it is closer to 5 V . This makes better use \nof the input range of the ADC and maximizes the resolution of \nthe system in terms of bits/dB. \nIf only a part of the RF input power range of the AD8363 is \nbeing used (for example, −10 dBm to −40 dBm), it may make \nsense to increase the scaling so that this reduced input range fits \ninto the available output swing of the AD8363 (0 V to 4.8 V). \nThe output swing can be reduced by adding a voltage divider on \nthe output pin, as shown in Figure 47 (with VOUT connected directly to VSET and a resistor divider on VOUT). Figure 47 \nalso shows how the output voltage swing can be increased using \na technique that is analogous to setting the gain of an op amp in noninverting mode. With the VSET pin being the equivalent of the inverting input of the op amp, a resistor divider is connected \nbetween VOUT and VSET. \n67VSET\nR1R2\nVOUT\n67VSET\nR1\nR2VOUT\n07368-146 \nFigure 47.

The choice of resistors should not result in excessive current draw out of VOUT. However, making R1 and R2 too large is also problematic. If the value of R2 is compatible with the 72 kΩ input resistance of the VSET input, \nthis input resistance, which varies slightly from device to device, \ncontributes to the resulting slope and output voltage. In general, the value of R2 should be at least ten times smaller than the input resistance of VSET. Values for R1 and R2 should, therefore, \nbe in the 1 kΩ to 5 kΩ range. \nIt is also important to take into account device-to-device and \nfrequency variation in output swing along with the AD8363 \noutput stage’s maximum output voltage of 4.8 V . The V\nOUT \ndistribution is well characterized at the bands of major frequencies in the Typical Performance Characteristics section \n(Figure 3 to Figure 18). \nOFFSET COMPENSATION, MINIMUM C LPF, AND \nMAXIMUM C HPF CAPACITANCE VALUES \nAn offset-compensation loop is used to eliminate small dc \noffsets within the internal VGA as shown in Figure 48. The \nhigh-pass corner frequency of this loop is set to about 1 MHz using an on-chip 25 pF capacitor. Because input signals that are below 1 MHz are interpreted as unwanted offset voltages, this restricts the operating frequency range of the device. To operate the AD8363 at lower frequencies (than 1 MHz), the high-pass corner \nfrequency must be reduced by connecting a capacitor between \nCHPF and VPOS. \nInternal offset voltages vary depending on the gain at which the \nVGA is operating and, therefore, on the input signal amplitude. When a large C\nHPF value is used, the offset correction process can \nlag the more rapid changes in the gain of the VGA, which can increase the time required for the loop to fully settle for a given \nsteady input amplitude. This can manifest itself in a jumpy, \nseemingly oscillatory response of the AD8363. \nCare should therefore be taken in choosing C\nHPF and C LPF \nbecause there is a potential to create oscillations. In general, make \nthe capacitance on the CLPF pin as large as possible; there is no maximum on the amount of capacitance that can be added to this pin. At high frequencies, there is no need for an external \ncapacitor on the CHPF pin; therefore, the pin can be left open. \nHowever, when trying to get a fast response time and/or when working at low frequencies, extra care in choosing the proper capacitance values for C\nHPF and C LPF is prudent. With the gain \ncontrol pin (VSET) connected to VOUT, V SET can slew at a rate \ndetermined by the on-chip squaring cell and C LPF. When V SET is \nchanging with time, the dc offsets in the VGA also vary with \nData Sheet  AD8363  \n \ntime. The speed at which V SET slews can create a time varying offset \nthat falls within the high -pass corner set by C HPF. Therefore, in \nmeasurement mode, take care to set C LPF appropriately to reduce \nthe slew. It is also worth not ing that most of the typical \nperformance data was derived with C LPF = 3.9 nF  and CHPF = 2.7 nF  \nand with a CW waveform.  \nThe m inimum appropriate C LPF based on slew rate limitations is \nas follows  \nCLPF > 20 × 10−3/FREQRFIN  (18) \nwhere:  \nCLPF is in farads . \nFREQ RFIN is in hertz.  \nThis takes into account the on -chip 25 pF capacitor, C F, in \nparallel with C LPF. However, because there are other internal \ndevice time delays that affect loop stability, use a minimum C LPF \nof 390 pF . \nThe minimum appropriate C HPF for a given high- pass pole \nfrequency is  \nCHPF = 29.2 × 10−6/FHP POLE − 25 pF  (19) \nwhere FHP POLE is in hertz. \nThe subtraction of 25 pF is a result of the on -chip 25 pF \ncapacitor in parallel with the external C HPF. Typically , choose \nCHPF to give a pole (3 dB corner) at least 1 decade below the \ndesired signal freque ncy. Note that the high pass corner of the \noffset compensation system is approximately 1 MHz without an \nexternal C HPF; therefore,  adding an external capacitor lowers the \ncorner frequency.  \nThe following example illustrates the proper selection of the input  \ncoupling capacitors, minimum C LPF, and maximum C HPF when \nusing the AD8363 in measurement mode for a 1  GHz input signal.  \n1. Choose the input coupling capacitors that have a 3 dB \ncorner at least one  decade below the input signal frequency.  \nFrom  Equation 8, C > 10/(2 × π × RF IN × 50) = 32 pF \nminimum . According to th is calculation, 32 pF is sufficient;  \nhowever, the input coupling capacitors should be  a much \nlarger  value, typically 0.1 µF. The offset comp ensation \ncircuit, which is connected to CHPF, should be the true determinant of the system high- pass corner frequency a nd \nnot the input coupling capac itors. With 0.1 µF coupling \ncapacitors, signals as low as 32 kHz can couple to the input , \nwhich is well be low the system high- pass frequency . \n2. Choose C\nLPF to reduce instabilities due to VSET  slew rate.  \nSee Equation 18, where FRQ RFIN = 1 GHz , and this results  in \nCLPF > 20 pF . However, as previously mentioned , values \nbelow 390 pF are not recommended. For this rea son, a 470  pF \ncapacitor was chosen. In addition , if fast response times a re \nnot required, a n even larger C LPF value than given here \nshould be chosen.  3. Choose  CHPF to set a 3  dB corner to the offset compensation  \nsystem . See Equation 19, where FHP POLE is in this case \n100 MHz , one decade below the desired signal . This results \nin a negative number and , obviously, a negative value is not \npractical. Because  the high -pass corner frequency is already \n1 MHz, this result simply illustrates that the appropriate \nsoluti on is to use no  external CHPF capacitor.  \nNote  that per E quation 9  \nFreq LP ≈ 1.83 × ITGT/(C LPF) \nA CLPF of 470 pF results in a small signal low -pass corner \nfrequency of approximately 144 k Hz. This reflects the bandwidth  \nof the measurement system , and how fas t the user can expect \nchanges on the output. It does not imply any limitations on the \ninput RF carrier frequency.  \ngm2\n07368-040gm1\nA = 1\n40dB g × X2gmCHPF\nVXVPOS\nVGA110Ω 110Ω25pF\n(INTERNAL)1pF 1pF\nIRFRFIN\n \nFigure 48.

Note \nthat the power in the preamble can be easily measured; however, \nthe C LPF value would have to be reduced slightly , and the noise in \nthe main signal would increase.  \n07368-054CH1  500mV M 1.00ms A  CH1      600mVCH1 RISE\n81.78µs\nCH1 FALL\n1.337ms\n1\nT  10.00%T\n \nFigure 50.

Referring to Figure 21 and Figure 22, there is a period \nof inactivity between the start of the RF waveform and the time \nat which V OUT begins to show a reaction. This happens as a result of \nthe implementation of the balancing of the squarer currents within the AD8363. This delay can be reduced by decreasing V\nTGT; \nhowever, as previously noted in the VTGT Interface section, \nthis has implications on the sensitivity, intercept, and dynamic \nrange. While the delay is reduced, reducing V TGT increases the \nrise and fall time of V OUT. \n CONTROLLER MODE BASIC CONNECTIONS \nIn addition to being a measurement device, the AD8363 can \nalso be configured to control rms signal levels, as shown in \nFigure 53. \nThe RF input to the device is configured as it was in measurement \nmode and either input can be used. A directional coupler taps off some of the power being generated by the VGA. If loss in the \nmain signal path is not a concern, and there are no issues with \nreflected energy from the next stage in the signal chain, a power splitter can be used instead of a directional coupler. Some additional attenuation may be required to set the maximum input signal at the AD8363 to be equal to the recommended \nmaximum input level for optimum linearity and temperature stability at the frequency of operation. \nThe VSET and VOUT pins are no longer shorted together. VOUT \nnow provides a bias or gain control voltage to the VGA. The gain control sense of the VGA must be negative and monotonic, that is, increasing voltage tends to decrease gain. However, the gain control transfer function of the device does not need to be well controlled or particularly linear. If the gain control sense of the \nVGA is positive, an inverting op amp circuit with a dc offset \nshift can be used between the AD8363 and the VGA to keep the \ngain control voltage in the 0.03 V to 4.8 V range. \nVSET becomes the set-point input to the system. This can be \ndriven by a DAC, as shown in Figure 53, if the output power is expected to vary, or it can simply be driven by a stable reference voltage, if constant output power is required. This DAC should have an output swing that covers the 0.15 V to 3.5 V range.  \nAD8363\nCLPFC10\nC12\nVSETVOUT\nDAC\n(0.15V TO 3.5V)(0.03V TO 4.8V AVAILABLE SWING)ATTENUATORPOUT PIN\nVAPCVGA OR VVA\n(OUTPUT POWER\nDECREASES AS\nVAPC INCREASES)\nINHI\nINLO\nC9\nSEE TEXT\n07368-063 \nFigure 53. Controller Mode Operation for Automatic Power Control \nWhen V SET is set to a particular value, the AD8363  compares \nthis value to the equivalent input power present at the RF input. \nIf these two values do not match, V OUT increases or decreases in \nan effort to balance the system. The dominant pole of the error amplifier/integrator circuit that drives V\nOUT is set by the capacitance \non the CLPF pin; some experimentation may be necessary to \nchoose the right value for this capacitor. \nAD8363 Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 24 of 29 In general, C LPF should be chosen to provide stable loop operation \nfor the complete output power control range. If the slope (in \ndB/V) of the gain control transfer function of the VGA is not constant, C\nLPF must be chosen to guarantee a stable loop when \nthe gain control slope is at its maximum. In addition, C LPF must \nprovide adequate averaging to the internal low range squaring detector so that the rms computation is valid. Larger values of C\nLPF \ntend to make the loop less responsive. \nThe relationship between V SET and the RF input follows the \nmeasurement mode behavior of the device. For example, Figure 4 \nshows the measurement mode transfer function at 900 MHz \nand that an input power of −10 dBm yields an output voltage of \napproximately 2.5 V . Therefore, in controller mode, if V SET is \n2.5 V , the AD8363 output would go to whatever voltage is \nnecessary to set the AD8363 input power to −10 dBm. \nCONSTANT OUTPUT POWER OPERATION \nIn controller mode, the AD8363 can be used to hold the output \npower of a VGA stable over a broad temperature/input power range. This is useful in topologies where a transmit card is driving an HPA, or when connecting any two power sensitive modules together. \nFigure 54 shows a schematic of a circuit setup that holds the output \npower to approximately −26 dBm at 2.14 GHz, when the input power is varied over a 40 dB dynamic range. Figure 55 shows the results. A portion of the output power is coupled off using a 10 dB directional coupler, and it is then fed into the AD8363. \nV\nSET is fixed at 0.95 V , which forces to AD8363 output voltage to \ncontrol the ADL5330  so that the input to the AD8363 is \napproximately −36 dBm. \nIf the AD8363 was in measurement mode and a −36 dBm input \npower is applied, the output voltage would be 0.95 V . A general-purpose, rail-to-rail op amp ( AD8062 ) is used to invert the slope \nof the AD8363 so that the gain of the ADL5330  decreases as \nthe AD8363 control voltage increases. The output power is \ncontrolled to a 10 dB higher power level than that seen by the AD8363 due to the coupler. The high-end power is limited \nby the linearity of the VGA ( ADL5330 ) with high attenuation \nand can be increased by using a higher linearity VGA. The low end power is limited by the maximum gain of the VGA (ADL5330 ) and can be increased by using a VGA with more \ngain. The temperature performance is directly related to the temperature performance of the AD8363 at 2.14 GHz and \n−26 dBm, using TCM1 = 0.52 V and TCM2 = 0.6 V . All other \ntemperature variations are removed by the AD8363. \nT1 T2C5\n100pF\nC6\n100pFC11\n100pF\nC12\n100pF\nC10\n0.1µF\nC12\n0.1µF\nC9\n0.1µFPIN\nINHI\nINLOOPHI\nOPLO\nGAINADL5330\nPOUT10dB\nCOUPLER\nAD8062\n10kΩ\n10kΩ 10kΩ10kΩ\n5V\n0.95V0.6V0.52V INHI TCM1\nTCM2\nVSETVOUT\nCLPFINLOAD8363\n07368-072 \nFigure 54.

B | Page 25 of 29 DESCRIPTION OF RF CHARACTERIZATION \nThe general hardware configuration used for most of the AD8363 \ncharacterization is shown in Figure 56. The AD8363 was driven \nin a single-ended configuration for all characterization. \nCharacterization of the AD8363 employed a multisite test \nstrategy. Several AD8363 devices mounted on circuit boards \nconstructed with Rogers 3006 material was simultaneously \ninserted into a remotely-controlled thermal test chamber. A \nKeithley S46 RF switching network connected an Agilent E8251A signal source to the appropriate device under test. An Agilent 34980A switch matrix provided switching of dc power and metering for the test sites. A PC running Agilent VEE Pro \ncontrolled the signal source, switching, and chamber temperature. A voltmeter measured the subsequent response to the stimulus, \nand the results were stored in a database for later analysis. In this way, multiple AD8363 devices were characterized over amplitude, \nfrequency, and temperature in a minimum amount of time. \nThe RF stimulus amplitude was calibrated up to the connector \nof the circuit board that carries the AD8363. However, the \ncalibration does not account for the slight losses due to the connector and the traces from the connector to the device under test. For this reason, there is a small absolute amplitude \nerror (<0.5 dB) not accounted for in the characterization data. \nThis implies a slight error in the reported intercept; however, \nthis is generally not important because the slope and the relative \naccuracy of the AD8363 are not affected. \nThe typical performance data was derived with C\nLPF = 3.9 nF \nand C HPF = 2.7 nF with a CW waveform. \n \n \nAD8363\nCHARACTERIZATION\nBOARD – TEST SITE 1\nAD8363\nCHARACTERIZATION\nBOARD – TEST SITE 2KEITHLEY S46\nMICROWAVE\nSWITCHAGILENT E8251A\nMICROWAVE\nSIGNAL\nGENERATORAGILENT 34980A\nSWITCH MATRIX/\nDC METERAGILENT E3631A\nDC POWER\nSUPPLIES\nPERSONAL\nCOMPUTERAD8363\nCHARACTERIZATION\nBOARD – TEST SITE 3\nRF DC DATA AND CONTROL\n07368-075 \nFigure 56.

The 0 Ω  resistor can be replaced with a larger resistor to add more filtering; however, it is \nat the expense of a voltage drop .
