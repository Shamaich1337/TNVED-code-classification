They are optimized for low voltage, high performance signal conditioning systems.\nThe L T1806/L T1807 have a very low distortion of –80dBc \nat 5MHz, a low input referred noise voltage of 3.5nV/√ Hz \nand a maximum offset voltage of 550μV that allows them to be used in high performance data acquisition systems.\nThe L T1806/L T1807 have an input range that includes \nboth supply rails and an output that swings within 20mV of either supply rail to maximize the signal dynamic range in low supply applications.\nThe L T1806/L T1807 maintain their performance for supplies \nfrom 2.5V to 12.6V and are speciﬁ  ed at 3V, 5V and ±5V \nsupplies. The inputs can be driven beyond the supplies without damage or phase reversal of the output.\nThe L T1806 is available in an 8-pin SO package with the \nstandard op amp pinout and a 6-pin TSOT-23 package. The L T1807 features the standard dual op amp pinout and is available in 8-pin SO and MSOP packages.These devices can be used as plug-in replacements for many op amps to improve input/output range and performance.

power sup-ply. Figure 1 depicts a simpliﬁ  ed schematic of the ampliﬁ  er. \nThe input stage is comprised of two differential ampliﬁ  ers, \na PNP stage Q1/Q2 and a NPN stage Q3/Q4 that are active over different ranges of common mode input voltage. The PNP differential pair is active between the negative supply to approximately 1.5V below the positive supply. As the input voltage moves closer toward the positive supply, the transistor Q5 will steer the tail current I\n1 to the current \nmirror Q6/Q7, activating the NPN differential pair. The PNP pair becomes inactive for the rest of the input common mode range up to the positive supply. APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nA pair of complementary common emitter stages Q14/Q15 \nthat enable the output to swing from rail to rail constructs the output stage. The capacitors C1 and C2 form the local feedback loops that lower the output impedance at high frequency. These devices are fabricated on Linear Technology’s proprietary high speed complementary bipolar process.\nPower Dissipation\nThe L T1806/L T1807 ampliﬁ  ers combine high speed with \nlarge output current in a small package, so there is a need  \nto ensure that the die’s junction temperature does not exceed 150°C.

L T1806 Simpliﬁ  ed Schematic Diagram\nLT1806/LT1807\n1818067fcor 8-lead MSOP package. All packages have the V– sup-\nply pin fused to the lead frame to enhance the thermal conductance when connecting to a ground plane or a large metal trace. Metal trace and plated through-holes can be used to spread the heat generated by the device to the backside of the PC board. For example, on a 3/32" FR-4 board with 2oz copper, a total of 660 square mil-limeters connects to Pin 4 of L T1807 in an SO-8 package (330 square millimeters on each side of the PC board) will bring the thermal resistance, θ\nJA, to about 85°C/W. Without \nextra metal trace beside the power line connecting to the V\n– pin to provide a heat sink, the thermal resistance will be \naround 105°C/W . More information on thermal resistance for all packages with various metal areas connecting to the V\n– pin is provided in Tables 1, 2 and 3.\nTable 1.

For a given supply voltage, the worst-case power dissipation P\nD(MAX)  \noccurs at the maximum quiescent supply current and at the output voltage which is half of either supply voltage (or the maximum swing if it is less than 1/2 the supply voltage). P\nD(MAX)  is given by:\n P D(MAX)  = (V S • IS(MAX) ) + (V S/2)2/R L\nExample: An L T1807 in SO-8 mounted on a 2500mm2 \narea of PC board without any extra heat spreading plane connected to its V\n– pin has a thermal resistance of \n105°C/W , θJA. Operating on ±5V supplies with both ampli-\nﬁ  ers simultaneously driving 50Ω loads, the worst-case power dissipation is given by:\n P\nD(MAX)  = 2 • (10 • 14mA) + 2 • (2.5)2/50 \n  = 0.28 + 0.25 = 0.53W\nLT1806/LT1807\n1918067fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe maximum ambient temperature that the part is \nallowed to operate is:\n TA = TJ – (P D(MAX)  • 105°C/W)\n  = 150°C – (0.53W • 105°C/W) = 94°CTo operate the device at higher ambient temperature, \nconnect more metal area to the V\n– pin to reduce the thermal \nresistance of the package as indicated in Table 2.\nInput Offset Voltage\nThe offset voltage will change depending upon which \ninput stage is active and the maximum offset voltage is guaranteed to less than 550μV. To maintain the precision characteristics of the ampliﬁ  er, the change of V\nOS over the \nentire input common mode range (CMRR) is limited to be less than 550μV on a single 5V and 3V supply.\nInput Bias Current\nThe input bias current polarity depends on a given input \ncommon voltage at which the input stage is operating. When the PNP input stage is active, the input bias currents ﬂ  ow out of the input pins. When the NPN input stage is activated, the input bias current ﬂ  ows into the input pins. \nBecause the input offset current is less than the input bias current, matching the source resistances at the input pins will reduce total offset error.Output\nThe L T1806/L T1807 can deliver a large output current, so \nthe short-circuit current limit is set around 85mA to prevent damage to the device. Attention must be paid to keep the junction temperature of the IC below the absolute maximum rating of 150°C (refer to the Power Dissipation section) when the output is continuously short circuited. The output of the ampliﬁ  er has reverse-biased diodes connected to \neach supply. If the output is forced beyond either supply, unlimited current will ﬂ  ow through these diodes. If the \ncurrent is transient and limited to one hundred milliamps or less, no damage to the device will occur.\nOverdrive Protection\nWhen the input voltage exceeds the power supplies, two \npairs of crossing diodes D1 to D4 will prevent the output from reversing polarity. If the input voltage exceeds either power supply by 700mV, diode D1/D2 or D3/D4 will turn on to keep the output at the proper polarity. For the phase reversal protection to perform properly, the input current must be limited to less than 5mA. If the ampliﬁ  er is severely \noverdriven, an external resistor should be used to limit the overdrive current.\nLT1806/LT1807\n2018067fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe L T1806/L T1807’s input stages are also protected \nagainst large differential input voltages of 1.4V or higher by a pair of back-to-back diodes, D5/D8, that prevent the emitter-base breakdown of the input transistors. The current in these diodes should be limited to less than 10mA when they are active. The worst-case differential input voltage usually occurs when the input is driven while the output is shorted to ground in a unity gain conﬁ  guration. \nIn addition, the ampliﬁ  er is protected against ESD strikes \nup to 3kV on all pins by a pair of protection diodes, ESDD1 to ESDD6, on each pin that are connected to the power supplies as shown in Figure 1.\nCapacitive Load\nThe L T1806/L T1807 are optimized for high bandwidth and \nlow distortion applications. They can drive a capacitive load of about 20pF in a unity-gain conﬁ  guration, and more \nfor higher gain. When driving a larger capacitive load, a resistor of 10Ω to 50Ω should be connected between the output and the capacitive load to avoid ringing or oscilla-tion. The feedback should still be taken from the output so that the resistor will isolate the capacitive load to ensure stability. Graphs on capacitive loads indicate the transient response of the ampliﬁ  er when driving the capacitive load \nwith a speciﬁ  ed series resistor.Feedback Components\nWhen feedback resistors are used to set up gain, care must \nbe taken to ensure that the pole formed by the feedback resistors and the total capacitance at the inverting input does not degrade stability. For instance, the L T1806/L T1807 in a noninverting gain of 2, set up with two 1k resistors and a capacitance of 3pF (part plus PC board) will probably ring in transient response. The pole is formed at 106MHz that will reduce phase margin by 34 degrees when the crossover frequency of the ampliﬁ  er is around 70MHz. A capacitor of 3pF or higher connected across the feedback resistor will eliminate any ringing or oscillation. \nSHDN Pin\nThe L T1806 has a SHDN  pin to reduce the supply current \nto less than 0.9mA. When the SHDN  pin is pulled low, it \nwill generate a signal to power down the device. If the pin is left unconnected, an internal pull-up resistor of 40k will keep the part fully operating as shown in Figure 1. The output will be high impedance during shutdown, and the turn-on and turn-off time is less than 100ns. Because the input is protected by a pair of back-to-back diodes, the input signal will feed through to the output during shutdown mode if the amplitude of signal between the inputs is larger than 1.4V.\nLT1806/LT1807\n2118067fc TYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nDriving A/D Converter\nThe L T1806/L T1807 have 60ns settling time to 0.01% on \na 2V step signal, and 20Ω output impedance at 100MHz, that makes them ideal for driving high speed A/D convert-ers. With the rail-to-rail input and output, and low supply voltage operation, the L T1806/L T1807 are also desirable for single supply applications. As shown in the application on the front page of this data sheet, the L T1807 drives a 10Msps, 12-bit, L TC1420 ADC in a gain of 20. Driving the L TC1420 differentially will optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, and the total harmonic distortion, THD, of the A/D converter. The lowpass ﬁ  lter, R5, R6 and C3 reduce noise or distortion products that might come from the input \nsignal. High quality capacitors and resistors, NPO chip capacitor and metal ﬁ  lm surface mount resistors, should \nbe used since these components can add to distortion. The voltage glitch of the converter, due to its sampling nature is buffered by the L T1807, and the ability of the ampliﬁ  er to settle it quickly will affect the spurious free dynamic range of the system. Figure 2 depicts the L T1806 driving L TC1420 at noninverting gain of 2 conﬁ  guration. \nThe FFT responses show a better than 92dB of spurious free dynamic range, SFDR.\nFigure 2.

Figure 4 depicts a single supply video line driver with AC coupling to minimize the quies-cent power dissipation. Resistors R1 and R2 are used to level-shift the input and output to provide the largest signal swing. The gain of 2 is set up with R3 and R4 to restore the signal at V\nOUT, which is attenuated by 6dB due to the \nmatching of the 75Ω line with the back-terminated resistor, R5. The back termination will eliminate any reﬂ  ection of \nthe signal that comes from the load. The input termination resistor , R\nT, is optional—it is used only if matching of \nthe incoming line is necessary. The values of C1, C2 and C3 are selected to minimize the droop of the luminance signal. In some less stringent requirements, the value of capacitors could be reduced. The –3dB bandwidth of the driver is about 90MHz on 5V supply, and the amount of peaking will vary upon the value of capacitor C4.\nFigure 4. 5V Single Supply Video Line Driver–+\nLT1806VIN\n18067 F04C1\n33μF\nC2\n150μFRT\n75ΩRLOAD\n75ΩVOUTR2\n5k\nR31kR4\n1k\nC4\n3pFR15k5V\n23\n67\n4R5\n75Ω75W\nCOAX CABLEC3\n1000μF\n+\n+\n+\nFigure 5.

At series resonance, the crystal is a low imped-ance and the positive feedback connection is what brings about oscillation at the series resonance frequency. The RC feedback around the other path ensures that the circuit does not ﬁ  nd a stable DC operating point and refuse to \noscillate. The comparator output is a 1MHz square wave with a measured jitter of 28ps\nRMS with a 5V supply and \n40ps RMS with a 3V supply. On the other side of the crystal, \nhowever, is an excellent looking sine wave except for the fact of the small high frequency glitch caused by the fast edge and the crystal capacitance (middle trace of Figure 9). \nSinusoid amplitude stability is maintained by the fact that the sine wave is basically a ﬁ  ltered version of the square \nwave; the usual amplitude control loops associated with sinusoidal oscillators are not immediately necessary.\n1 \nOne can make use of this sine wave by buffering and ﬁ  ltering it, and this is the combined task of the L T1806. It is conﬁ  gured as a bandpass ﬁ  lter with a Q of 5 and does \na good job of cleaning up and buffering the sine wave. Distortion was measured at –70dBc and –60dBc on the second and third harmonics. \nFigure 8.
