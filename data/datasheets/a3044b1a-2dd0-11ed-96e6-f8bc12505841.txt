The operation can be best understood by\nreferring to the block diagram. At the start of each cycle, the oscillator sets the driver logic and turns on the\npower MOSFET to conduct current through the inductor or transformer. The peak current in the MOSFET is\ncontrolled by the voltage at the COMP pin. The COMP voltage increases with larger loads and decrease with\nsmaller loads. This voltage is compared with the sum of a voltage proportional to the power MOSFET current\nand an internally generated slope compensation ramp. Slope compensation is used in current mode PWM\narchitectures to eliminate subharmonic current oscillation that occurs with static duty cycles greater than 50%.\nWhen the summed signal exceeds the COMP voltage, the PWM comparator resets the driver logic, turning off\nthe power MOSFET. The driver logic is then set by the oscillator at the end of the switching cycle to initiate the\nnext power period.\nThe LM5002 has dedicated protection circuitry to protect the IC from abnormal operating conditions. Cycle-by-\ncycle current limiting prevents the power MOSFET current from exceeding 0.5A. This feature can also be used\nto soft start the regulator. Thermal shutdown circuitry holds the driver logic in reset when the die temperature\nreaches 165°C, and returns to normal operation when the die temperature drops by approximately 20°C. The EN\npin can be used as an input voltage undervoltage lockout (UVLO) during start-up to prevent operation with less\nthan the minimum desired input voltage.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nwww.ti.comLM5002\nSNVS496F – JANUARY 2007 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: LM5002\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 High Voltage VCC Regulator\nThe LM5002 VCC low dropout (LDO) regulator allows the LM5002 to operate at the lowest possible input\nvoltage. The VCC pin voltage is very nearly equal to the input voltage from 2.8 V up to approximately 6.9 V.\nAs the input voltage continues to increase, the VCC voltage is regulated at the 6.9 V set-point. The total input\noperating range of the VCC LDO regulator is 3.1 V to 75 V.\nThe output of the VCC regulator is current limited to 20 mA. During power-up, the VCC regulator supplies current\ninto the required decoupling capacitor (0.47 µF or greater ceramic capacitor) at the VCC pin. When the VCC\nvoltage exceeds the VCC UVLO threshold of 2.8 V and the EN pin is greater than 1.26 V the PWM controller\nis enabled and switching begins. The controller remains enabled until VCC falls below 2.7 V or the EN pin falls\nbelow 1.16 V.\nAn auxiliary supply voltage can be applied to the VCC pin to reduce the IC power dissipation. If the auxiliary\nvoltage is greater than 6.9 V, the internal regulator essentially shuts-off, and internal power dissipation is\ndecreased by the VIN voltage times the operating current. The overall converter efficiency also improves if the\nVIN voltage is much higher than the auxiliary voltage. Do not exceed 14 V with an externally applied VCC\nvoltage. The VCC regulator series pass MOSFET includes a body diode (see Section 7.2) between VCC and\nVIN that must not be forward biased in normal operation. Therefore, the auxiliary VCC voltage must never\nexceed the VIN voltage.\nIn high voltage applications take extra care to ensure the VIN pin does not exceed the absolute maximum\nvoltage rating of 76 V. Voltage ringing on the VIN line during line transients that exceeds the Absolute Maximum\nRatings can damage the IC. Both careful PCB layout and the use of quality bypass capacitors placed close to\nthe VIN and GND pins are essential.\n7.3.2 Oscillator\nA single external resistor connected between RT and GND pins sets the LM5002 oscillator frequency. To set a\ndesired oscillator frequency (F SW), the necessary value for the RT resistor can be calculated with Equation 1 .\nRT = 13.1 x 109 x1\nFSW- 83 ns\n(1)\nThe tolerance of the external resistor and the frequency tolerance indicated in the Section 6.5  must be taken into\naccount when determining the worst case frequency range.\n7.3.3 External Synchronization\nThe LM5002 can be synchronized to the rising edge of an external clock. The external clock must have a higher\nfrequency than the free running oscillator frequency set by the RT resistor. The clock signal must be coupled\nthrough a 100-pF capacitor into the RT pin. A peak voltage level greater than 2.6 V at the RT pin is required for\ndetection of the sync pulse. The DC voltage across the RT resistor is internally regulated at 1.5 V. The negative\nportion of the AC voltage of the synchronizing clock is clamped to this 1.5 V by an amplifier inside the LM5002\nwith approximately 100- Ω output impedance. Therefore, the AC pulse superimposed on the RT resistor must\nhave positive pulse amplitude of 1.1 V or greater to successfully synchronize the oscillator. The sync pulse width\nmeasured at the RT pin must have a duration greater than 15 ns and less than 5% of the switching period. The\nsync pulse rising edge initiates the internal CLK signal rising edge, which turns off the power MOSFET. The\nRT resistor is always required, whether the oscillator is free running or externally synchronized. Place the RT\nresistor very close to the device and connected directly to the RT and GND pins of the LM5002.\n7.3.4 Enable and Standby\nThe LM5002 contains a dual level Enable circuit. When the EN pin voltage is below 450 mV, the IC is in a low\ncurrent shutdown mode with the VCC LDO disabled. When the EN pin voltage is raised above the shutdown\nthreshold but below the 1.26-V standby threshold, the VCC LDO regulator is enabled, while the remainder of the\nIC is disabled. When the EN pin voltage is raised above the 1.26-V standby threshold, all functions are enabledLM5002\nSNVS496F – JANUARY 2007 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5002\nand normal operation begins. An internal 6-µA current source pulls up the EN pin to activate the IC when the EN\npin is left disconnected.\n7.3.5 Error Amplifier and PWM Comparator\nAn internal high-gain error amplifier generates an error signal proportional to the difference between the\nregulated output voltage and an internal precision reference. The output of the error amplifier is connected\nto the COMP pin allowing the user to add loop compensation, typically a Type-II network, as illustrated in Figure\n7-1. This network creates a low-frequency pole that rolls off the high DC gain of the amplifier, which is necessary\nto accurately regulate the output voltage. F DC_POLE  is the closed-loop unity gain (0 dB) frequency of this pole.\nA zero provides phase boost near the closed-loop unity gain frequency, and a high-frequency pole attenuates\nswitching noise. The PWM comparator compares the current sense signal from the current sense amplifier to the\nerror amplifier output voltage at the COMP pin.\nFigure 7-1. Type II Compensator\nWhen isolation between primary and secondary circuits is required, the Error Amplifier is usually disabled by\nconnecting the FB pin to GND. This allows the COMP pin to be driven directly by the collector of an opto-coupler.\nIn isolated designs the external error amplifier is placed on the secondary circuit and drives the opto-coupler\nLED. The compensation network is connected to the secondary side error amplifier. An example of an isolated\nregulator with an opto-coupler is shown in Figure 8-6 .\n7.3.6 Current Amplifier and Slope Compensation\nThe LM5002 employs peak current-mode control that also provides a cycle-by-cycle overcurrent protection\nfeature. An internal 100-m Ω current sense resistor measures the current in the power MOSFET source. The\nsense resistor voltage is amplified 30 times to provide a 3 V/A signal into the current limit comparator. Current\nlimiting is initiated if the internal current limit comparator input exceeds the 1.5-V threshold, corresponding to\n0.5 A. When the current limit comparator is triggered, the SW output pin immediately switches to a high\nimpedance state.\nThe current sense signal is reduced to a scale factor of 2.1 V/A for the PWM comparator signal. The signal\nis then summed with a 450-mV peak slope compensation ramp. The combined signal provides the PWM\ncomparator with a control signal that reaches 1.5 V when the MOSFET current is 0.5 A. For duty cycles greater\nthan 50%, current mode control circuits are subject to subharmonic oscillation (alternating between short and\nlong PWM pulses every other cycle). Adding a fixed slope voltage ramp signal (slope compensation) to the\ncurrent sense signal prevents this oscillation. The 450-mV ramp (zero volts when the power MOSFET turns\non, and 450 mV at the end of the PWM clock cycle) adds a fixed slope to the current sense ramp to prevent\noscillation.www.ti.comLM5002\nSNVS496F – JANUARY 2007 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: LM5002\nTo prevent erratic operation at low duty cycle, a leading edge blanking circuit attenuates the current sense signal\nwhen the power MOSFET is turned on. When the MOSFET is initially turned on, current spikes from the power\nMOSFET drain-source and gate-source capacitances flow through the current sense resistor. These transient\ncurrents normally cease within 50 ns with proper selection of rectifier diodes and proper PCB layout.\n7.3.7 Power MOSFET\nThe LM5002 switching regulator includes an N-Channel MOSFET with 850-m Ω ON-resistance. The ON-\nresistance of the LM5002 MOSFET varies with temperature as shown in Section 6.6. The typical total gate\ncharge for the MOSFET is 2.4 nC which is supplied from the VCC pin when the MOSFET is turned on.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Thermal Protection\nInternal thermal shutdown circuitry is provided to protect the IC in the event the maximum junction temperature\nis exceeded. When the 165°C junction temperature threshold is reached, the regulator is forced into a low power\nstandby state, disabling all functions except the VCC regulator. Thermal hysteresis allows the IC to cool down\nbefore it is re-enabled. Note that because the VCC regulator remains functional during this period, the soft-start\ncircuit shown in Figure 8-4  must be augmented if soft start from thermal shutdown state is required.LM5002\nSNVS496F – JANUARY 2007 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5002\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification,\nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for\ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe following information is intended to provide guidelines for the power supply designer using the LM5002.\n8.1.1 VIN\nThe voltage applied to the VIN pin can vary within the range of 3.1 V to 75 V. The current into the VIN pin\ndepends primarily on the gate charge of the power MOSFET, the switching frequency, and any external load on\nthe VCC pin. It is recommended to use the filter shown in Figure 8-1  to suppress transients that may occur at\nthe input supply. This is particularly important when VIN is operated close to the maximum operating rating of the\nLM5002.\nWhen power is applied and the VIN voltage exceeds 2.8 V with the EN pin voltage greater than 0.45 V, the\nVCC regulator is enabled, supplying current into the external capacitor connected to the VCC pin. When the\nVIN voltage is between 2.8 V and 6.9 V, the VCC voltage is approximately equal to the VIN voltage. When the\nvoltage on the VCC pin exceeds 6.9 V, the VCC pin voltage is regulated at 6.9 V. In typical flyback applications,\nan auxiliary transformer winding is connected through a diode to the VCC pin. This winding must raise the\nVCC voltage above 6.9 V to shut off the internal start-up regulator. The current requirements from this winding\nare relatively small, typically less than 20 mA. If the VIN voltage is much higher than the auxiliary voltage, the\nauxiliary winding significantly improves the conversion efficiency. It also reduces the power dissipation within the\nLM5002. The externally applied VCC voltage must never exceed 14 V. Also the applied VCC must never exceed\nthe VIN voltage to avoid reverse current through the internal VCC to VIN diode shown in the LM5002 Section\n7.2.\nFigure 8-1. Input Transient Protection\n8.1.2 SW PIN\nAttention must be given to the PCB layout for the SW pin that connects to the power MOSFET drain. Energy can\nbe stored in parasitic inductance and capacitance that causes switching spikes that negatively affect efficiency,\nand conducted and radiated emissions. These connections must be as short as possible to reduce inductance\nand as wide as possible to reduce resistance. The loop area, defined by the SW and GND pin connections, the\ntransformer or inductor terminals, and their respective return paths, must be minimized.\n8.1.3 EN or UVLO Voltage Divider Selection\nAn external setpoint resistor divider from VIN to GND can be used to determine the minimum operating input\nrange of the regulator. The divider must be designed such that the EN pin exceeds the 1.26-V standby threshold\nwhen VIN is in the desired operating range. The internal 6-µA current source must be included when determining\nthe resistor values. The shutdown and standby thresholds have 100-mV hysteresis to prevent noise from\ntoggling between modes. When the VIN voltage is below 3.5 VDC during start-up and the operating temperature\nis below –20°C, the EN pin must have a pullup resistor that provides 2 µA or greater current.

The enabling voltage may exceed the Zener\nvoltage, however the Zener current must be limited to less than 4 mA.\nTwo dedicated comparators connected to the EN pin are used to detect undervoltage and shutdown conditions.\nWhen the EN pin voltage is below 0.45 V, the controller is in a low-current shutdown mode where the VIN current\nis reduced to 95 µA. For an EN pin voltage greater than 0.45 V but less than 1.26 V, the controller is in standby\nmode, with all internal circuits operational, but the PWM gate driver signal is blocked. Once the EN pin voltage is\ngreater than 1.26 V, the controller is fully enabled. Two external resistors can be used to program the minimum\noperational voltage for the power converter as shown in Figure 8-2 . When the EN pin voltage falls below the\n1.26 V threshold, an internal 100 mV threshold hysteresis prevents noise from toggling the state, so the voltage\nmust be reduced to 1.16 V to transition to standby. Resistance values for R1 and R2 can be determined from\nEquation 2  and Equation 3 .\nR1 =VPWR - 1.26V\nIDIVIDER\n(2)\nR2 =1.26V\nIDIVIDER  + 6 PA\n(3)\nwhere:\n• V PWR is the desired turnon voltage\n• I DIVIDER  is an arbitrary current through R1 and R2\nFor example, if the LM5002 is to be enabled when V PWR reaches 16 V, I DIVIDER  could be chosen as 501 µA that\nsets R1 to 29.4 k Ω and R2 to 2.49 k Ω. The voltage at the EN pin must not exceed 10 V unless the current into\nthe 6 V protection Zener diode is limited below 4 mA. The EN pin voltage must not exceed 14 V at any time. Be\nsure to check both the power and voltage rating (some 0603 resistors are rated as low as 50 V) for the selected\nR1 resistor.\nFigure 8-2. Basic EN (UVLO) Configuration\nRemote configuration of the LM5002\'s operational modes can be accomplished with open drain device(s)\nconnected to the EN pin as shown in Figure 8-3 . A MOSFET or an NPN transistor connected to the EN pin can\nforce the regulator into the low power off state. Adding a PN diode in the drain (or collector) provides the offset to\nachieve the standby state. The advantage of standby is that the VCC LDO is not disabled and external circuitry\npowered by VCC remains functional.LM5002\nSNVS496F – JANUARY 2007 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5002\nFigure 8-3. Remote Standby and Disable Control\n8.1.4 Soft Start\nSoft start (SS) can be implemented with an external capacitor connected to COMP through a diode as shown in\nFigure 8-4 . The COMP discharge MOSFET conducts during Shutdown and Standby modes to keep the COMP\nvoltage below the PWM offset (1.3 V), which inhibits PWM pulses. The error amplifier attempts to raise the\nCOMP voltage after the EN pin exceeds the 1.26 V standby threshold. Because the error amplifier output can\nonly sink current, the internal COMP pullup resistor (approximately 5 k Ω) supplies the charging current to the SS\ncapacitor. The SS capacitor causes the COMP voltage to gradually increase until the output voltage achieves\nregulation and FB assumes control of the COMP and the PWM duty cycle. The SS capacitor continues charging\nthrough a large resistance, R SS, preventing the SS circuit from interfering with the normal error amplifier function.\nDuring shutdown, the VCC diode discharges the SS capacitor.\nFigure 8-4.

Non-Isolated Flyback Schematic\n8.2.1.1 Design Requirements\nThe non-isolated flyback converter shown in Figure 8-5  uses the internal voltage reference for the regulation\nsetpoint. The output is 5 V at 500 mA while the input voltage can vary from 16 V to 42 V. The switching\nfrequency is set to 250 kHz. An auxiliary winding on transformer (T1) provides 7.5 V to power the LM5002 when\nthe output is in regulation. This disables the internal high-voltage VCC LDO regulator and improves efficiency.\nThe input undervoltage threshold is 13.9 V. The converter can be shut down by driving the EN input below\n1.26 V with an open-collector or open-drain transistor. An external synchronizing frequency can be applied to\nthe SYNC input. An optional soft-start circuit is connected to the COMP pin input. When power is applied, the\nsoft-start capacitor (C7) is discharged and limits the voltage applied to the PWM comparator by the internal error\namplifier. The internal approximate 5-k Ω COMP pullup resistor charges the soft-start capacitor until regulation\nis achieved. The VCC pullup resistor (R7) continues to charge C7 so that the soft-start circuit does not affect\nthe compensation network in normal operation. If the output capacitance is small, the soft-start circuit can\nbe adjusted to limit the power-on output voltage overshoot. If the output capacitance is sufficiently large, no\nsoft-start circuit is required because the LM5002 gradually charges the output capacitor by current limiting at\napproximately 500 mA (I LIM) until regulation is achieved.\n8.2.1.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n8.2.1.2.1 Switching Frequency\nThe R T (R3) can be found using Equation 1 . For 250-kHz operation, a value of 51.3 kΩ was calculated. A\n52.3-kΩ resistor is selected as the closest available value.\n8.2.1.2.2 Flyback Transformer\nTwo things require consideration when specifying a flyback transformer. First, the turns ratio to determine the\nduty cyle D (MOSFET on-time compared to the switching period). Second, the primary inductance (L PRI) to\ndetermine the current sense ramp for current-mode control.\nTo start, the primary inductance in continous current mode (CCM) is designed to provide a ramp during the\nMOSFET on-time of around 30% of the full load MOSFET current. This produces a good signal-to-noise ratio for\ncurrent mode control.LM5002\nSNVS496F – JANUARY 2007 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM5002\nThe transfer function of a flyback power stage is Equation 4 .\nOUT SEC\nIN PRIV N DxV 1 D N \x10\n(4)\nwhere:\n• V IN is the input voltage\n• V OUT is the secondary output voltage\n• D is the duty cycle of the MOSFET for one switching cycle\n• N PRI is the number of turns on the primary winding of the transformer\n• N SEC is the number of turns on the secondary winding of the transformer\nThe duty cycle can be derived as shown in Equation 5 .\nOUT\nIN SEC\nOUT\nPRIVDV N VN u\x0e\n(5)\nAnd the approximate turns ratio is given by Equation 6 .\nSEC OUT\nPRI INN V (1 D)\nN V Du \x10  u\n(6)\nThe primary inducance (L PRI) is calculated using Equation 7 .\nIN\nsw\nPRI\nSEC\nOUT(MAX)\nPRI1V D fLNRR INu u \n \nu u \n(7)\nwhere:\n• L PRI is the transformer inductance referenced to the primary side\n• RR is the ripple ratio of the reflected secondary output current (ypically between 30% and 40%)\nThe auxillary winding turns ratio can be found with Equation 8 .\nAUX\nAUX SEC\nOUTVN N V u \n(8)\nwhere:\n• N AUX is the number of turns on the auxiliary winding of the transformer\n• V AUX is the desired VCC voltage\nThe CCM duty cycle can be designed for 50% with minimum input voltage.

If the topology is operated in Discontinuous\nConduction Mode (DCM), the RHPZ does not exist. It is a function of the duty cycle, load and inductance, and\ncauses an increase in loop gain while reducing the loop phase margin.

Use short, direct connections to avoid clock jitter due to ground voltage differentials. Small package\nsurface mount X7R or X5R capacitors are preferred for high-frequency performance and limited variation over\ntemperature and applied voltage.\nIf an application using the LM5002 results high junction temperatures during normal operation, multiple vias from\nthe GND pin to a PCB ground plane help conduct heat away from the IC. Judicious positioning of the PCB within\nthe end product, along with use of any available air flow helps reduce the junction temperatures. If using forced\nair cooling, avoid placing the LM5002 in the air flow shadow of large components, such as input capacitors,\ninductors or transformers.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 10-1.
