The \nports can be configured to any combination of logic inputs \nand logic outputs, and default to logic inputs on power-up.\nFigure 1 is the MAX7300 functional diagram. Any I/O port \ncan be configured as a push-pull output (sinking 10mA, \nsourcing 4.5mA), or a Schmitt-trigger logic input. Each \ninput has an individually selectable internal pullup resis -\ntor. Additionally, transition detection allows seven ports \n(P24 to P30) to be monitored in any maskable combina -\ntion for changes in their logic status. A detected transi-  \ntion is flagged through a status register bit, as well as an \ninterrupt pin (port P31), if desired.\nThe port configuration registers individually set the 28 \nports, P4 to P31, as GPIO. A pair of bits in registers  \n0x09 through 0x0F sets each port’s configuration  \n(Tables 1 and 2).\nThe 36-pin MAX7300AAX and 40-pin MAX7300ATL have  \n28 ports, P4 to P31. The 28-pin MAX7300ANI, \nMAX7300AAI, and MAX7300ATI have only 20 ports avail-  \nable, P12 to P31. The eight unused ports should be  \nconfigured as outputs on power-up by writing 0x55 to  registers 0x09 and 0x0A. If this is not done, the eight \nunused ports remain as unconnected inputs and quies -\ncent supply current rises, although there is no damage \nto the part.\nRegister Control of I/O Ports  \nAcross Multiple Drivers\nThe MAX7300 offers 20 or 28 I/O ports, depending on \npackage choice. Two addressing methods are avail -\nable. Any single port (bit) can be written (set/cleared) \nat once; or, any sequence of eight ports can be written \n(set/cleared) in any combination at once. There are no \nboundaries; it is equally acceptable to write P0 to P7, P1 \nto P8, or P31 to P38 (P32 to P38 are nonexistent, so the \ninstructions to these bits are ignored).\nShutdown\nWhen the MAX7300 is in shutdown mode, all ports are \nforced to inputs, and the pullup current sources are \nturned off. Data in the port and control registers remain \nunaltered, so port configuration and output levels are \nrestored when the MAX7300 is taken out of shutdown.  \nThe MAX7300 can still be programmed while in shutdown \nmode. For minimum supply current in shutdown mode, \nlogic inputs should be at GND or V+ potential. Shutdown \nmode is exited by setting the S bit in the configuration \nregister (Table 8).PIN\nNAME FUNCTION\n28 SSOP 28 TQFN-EP 36 SSOP 40 TQFN-EP\n1 26 1 36 ISETBias Current Setting.

The interface uses a serial data line (SDA) and a \nserial clock line (SCL) to achieve bidirectional commu-  \nnication between master(s) and slave(s). A master (typ -\nically a microcontroller) initiates all data transfers to and \nfrom the MAX7300, and generates the SCL clock that \nsynchronizes the data transfer (Figure 2).\nThe MAX7300 SDA line operates as both an input and \nan open-drain output. A pullup resistor, typically 4.7k Ω,  \nis required on SDA. The MAX7300 SCL line operates  \nonly as an input. A pullup resistor, typically 4.7k Ω, is \nrequired on SCL if there are multiple masters on the \n2-wire interface, or if the master in a single-master system \nhas an open-drain SCL output.\nEach transmission consists of a START condition  \n(Figure 3) sent by a master, followed by the MAX7300 \n7-bit slave address plus R/ W bit (Figure 6), a register \naddress byte, one or more data bytes, and finally a  \nSTOP condition (Figure 3). START and STOP Conditions\nBoth SCL and SDA remain high when the interface is  \nnot busy. A master signals the beginning of a transmis -\nsion with a START (S) condition by transitioning SDA \nfrom high to low while SCL is high. When the master  \nhas finished communicating with the slave, it issues a \nSTOP (P) condition by transitioning SDA from low to  \nhigh while SCL is high. The bus is then free for another \ntransmission (Figure 3).\nBit Transfer\nOne data bit is transferred during each clock pulse.  \nThe data on SDA must remain stable while SCL is high \n(Figure 4).\nAcknowledge\nThe acknowledge bit is a clocked 9th bit, which the  \nrecipient uses to handshake receipt of each byte of \ndata (Figure 5). Thus, each byte transferred effectively  \nrequires 9 bits. The master generates the 9th clock  \npulse, and the recipient pulls down SDA during the \nacknowledge clock pulse, such that the SDA line is \nsta-ble low during the high period of the clock pulse. \nWhen the master is transmitting to the MAX7300, the  \nMAX7300 generates the acknowledge bit since the Table 2.

When the MAX7300 is \ntransmitting to the master, the master generates the  \nacknowledge bit since the master is the recipient.\nSlave Address\nThe MAX7300 has a 7-bit-long slave address (Figure \n6). The eighth bit following the 7-bit slave address is \nthe RW bit. It is low for a write command and high for a  \nread command. \nThe first 3 bits (MSBs) of the MAX7300 slave address \nare always 100. Slave address bits A3, A2, A1, and A0  \nare selected by the address inputs, AD1 and AD0. \nThese two input pins can be connected to GND, V+, \nSDA, or SCL. The MAX7300 has 16 possible slave  addresses (Table 3), and therefore a maximum of 16 \nMAX7300 devices can share the same interface.\nMessage Format for Writing  \nthe MAX7300\nA write to the MAX7300 comprises the transmission \nof the MAX7300’s slave address with the R/ W bit set \nto zero, followed by at least 1 byte of information. The \nfirst byte of information is the command byte. The com-  \nmand byte determines which register of the MAX7300  \nis to be written by the next byte, if received. If a STOP  \ncondition is detected after the command byte is  \nreceived, then the MAX7300 takes no further action \n(Figure 7) beyond storing the command byte. Figure 1.

The first data byte goes into the internal \nregister of the MAX7300 selected by the command byte \n(Figure 8). If multiple data bytes are transmitted before \na STOP condition is detected, these bytes are gener -\nally stored in subsequent MAX7300 internal registers \nbecause the command byte address generally autoincre -\nments (Table 4). \nMessage Format for Reading \nThe MAX7300 is read using the MAX7300’s internally \nstored command byte as address pointer, the same way \nthe stored command byte is used as address pointer for a write. The pointer generally autoincrements after each \ndata byte is read using the same rules as for a write \n(Table 4). Thus, a read is initiated by first configuring the \nMAX7300’s command byte by performing a write (Figure \n7). The master can now read ‘n’ consecutive bytes from \nthe MAX7300, with the first data byte being read from \nthe register addressed by the initialized command byte \n(Figure 9). When performing read-after-write verification, \nremember to reset the command byte’s address because \nthe stored control byte address generally has been auto -\nincremented after the write (Table 4). Table 5 is the regis -\nter address map.Figure 4. Bit TransferFigure 3.

This is because it is pos -\nsible for master 2 to take over the bus after master 1 \nhas set up the MAX7300?s address pointer, but before  \nmaster 1 has read the data. If master 2 subsequently \nchanges, the MAX7300’s address pointer, then master 1’s \ndelayed read can be from an unexpected location.\nCommand Address Autoincrementing \nAddress autoincrementing allows the MAX7300 to be \nconfigured with the shortest number of transmissions by \nminimizing the number of times the command address \nneeds to be sent. The command address stored in the \nMAX7300 generally increments after each data byte is \nwritten or read (Table 4).Initial Power-Up\nOn initial power-up, all control registers are reset and the \nMAX7300 enters shutdown mode (Table 6).\nTransition (Port Data Change) Detection\nPort transition detection allows any combination of the \nseven ports P24–P30 to be continuously monitored for \nchanges in their logic status (Figure 10). A detected \nchange is flagged on the transition detection mask reg-  \nister INT status bit, D7 (Table 10). If port P31 is config-  \nured as an output (Tables 1 and 2), then P31 also  \nautomatically becomes an active-high interrupt output \n(INT), which follows the condition of the INT status bit. \nPort P31 is set as output by writing bit D7 = 0 and bit  \nD6 = 1 to the port configuration register (Table 1). Note \nthat the MAX7300 does not identify which specific  \nport(s) caused the interrupt, but provides an alert that  \none or more port levels have changed. \nThe mask register contains 7 mask bits that select \nwhich of the seven ports P24–P30 are to be monitored \n(Table 10). Set the appropriate mask bit to enable that  \nport for transition detect. Clear the mask bit if transi-  Figure 6. Slave AddressFigure 5.

Transition detection \nworks regardless of whether the port being monitored is \nset to input or output, but generally, it is not particularly \nuseful to enable transition detection for outputs.\nTo use transition detection, first set up the mask register \nand configure port P31 as an output, as described above. \nThen enable transition detection by setting the M bit in \nthe configuration register (Table 9). Whenever the config -\nuration register is written with the M bit set, the MAX7300 \nupdates an internal 7-bit snapshot register, which holds \nthe comparison copy of the logic states of ports P24 \nthrough P30. The update action occurs regardless of the \nprevious state of the M bit, so that it is not necessary to \nclear the M bit and then set it again to update the snap -\nshot register.\nWhen the configuration register is written with the M bit \nset, transition detection is enabled and remains enabled \nuntil either the configuration register is written with the \nM bit clear, or a transition is detected. The INT status bit \n(transition detection mask register bit D7) goes low. Port \nP31 (if enabled as INT output) also goes low, if it was not \nalready low.\nOnce transition detection is enabled, the MAX7300 \ncontinuously compares the snapshot register against \nthe changing states of P24 through P31. If a change on \nany of the monitored ports is detected, even for a short \ntime (like a pulse), the INT status bit (transition detec -\ntion mask register bit D7) is set. Port P31 (if enabled \nas INT output) also goes high. The INT output and INT \nstatus bit are not cleared if more changes occur or if the \ndata pattern returns to its original snapshot condition.  The only way to clear INT is to access (read or write) the \ntransition detection mask register (Table 10). So if the \ntransition detection mask register is read twice in succes -\nsion after a transition event, the first time reads with bit \nD7 set (identifying the event), and the second time reads \nwith bit D7 clear.\nTransition detection is a one-shot event. When INT has \nbeen cleared after responding to a transition event, tran -\nsition detection is automatically disabled, even though \nthe M bit in the configuration register remains set (unless \ncleared by the user). Reenable transition detection by \nwriting the configuration register with the M bit set to take \na new snapshot of the seven ports P24 to P30.\nExternal Component R ISET\nThe MAX7300 uses an external resistor, R ISET, to set \ninternal biasing. Use a resistor value of 39k Ω.\nApplications Information\nLow-Voltage Operation\nThe MAX7300 operates down to 2V supply voltage \n(although the sourcing and sinking currents are not guar -\nanteed), providing that the MAX7300 is powered up ini -\ntially to at least 2.5V to trigger the device’s internal reset.\nSerial Interface Latency\nWhen a MAX7300 register is written through the I 2C  \ninterface, the register is updated on the rising edge of \nSCL during the data byte’s acknowledge bit (Figure 5). \nThe delay from the rising edge of SCL to the internal  \nregister being updated can range from 50ns to 350ns.Figure 8.

A ground plane is not necessary, but may be \nuseful to reduce supply impedance if the MAX7300 out -\nputs are to be heavily loaded. Keep the track length from \nthe ISET pin to the R ISET resistor as short as possible, \nand take the GND end of the register either to the ground \nplane or directly to the GND pins.Power-Supply Considerations\nThe MAX7300 operates with power-supply voltages of \n2.5V to 5.5V. Bypass the power supply to GND with a \n0.047µF capacitor as close to the device as possible. \nAdd a 1µF capacitor if the MAX7300 is far away from the \nboard’s input bulk decoupling capacitor.Table 4.
