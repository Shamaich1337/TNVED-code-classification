Operation beyond the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may \naffect product reliability.  \nMAXIMUM POWER DISSIP ATION  \nThe maximum power that can be safely dissipated by the \nADA4891 -1/ADA4891 -2/ADA4891 -3/ADA4891- 4 is limited  \nby the associated rise in junction temperature. The maximum \nsafe junction temperature for plastic encapsulated devices is \ndetermined by the glass transition temperature of the plastic, approximately 150°C. Temporarily exceeding thi s limit can \ncause a shift in parametric performance due to a change in the \nstresses exerted on the die by the package. Exceeding a junction \ntemperature of 175°C for an extended period can result in device failure.  \nThe still -air thermal properties of the pa ckage (θ\nJA), the ambient \ntemperature (T A), and the total power dissipated in the package \n(PD) can be used to determine the junction temperature of the die.  \nThe junction temperature can be calculated as  \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) (1) \nThe power dissipated in the package (P D) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the \npackage due to the load drive for all outputs. It can be calculated by  \nPD = (VT × IS) + (VS − VOUT) × (VOUT/RL) (2) \nwhere:  \nVT is the total  supply rail.  \nIS is the quiescent current.  \nVS is the positive supply rail. \nVOUT is the output of the amplifier.  \nRL is the output load of the amplifier.  To ensure proper operati on, it is necessary to observe the maxi -\nmum power derating curve s shown  in Figure 6. These curves \nare derived by setting T J = 150°C in Equation 1. Figure 6 shows \nthe maximum safe power dissipation in the package vs. the \nambient temperature on a JEDEC standard 4 -layer board.  \n00.51.02.0\n1.5\n–55 –35 –15 5 25 45 65 85 105 125\nAMBIENT TEMPER ATURE (°C)MAXIMUM POWER DISSI PATION (W)14-LEAD TSSOP\n8-LEAD SOIC_N\n14-LEAD SOIC_N5-LEAD SOT-238-LEAD MSOPTJ = 150°C\n08054-002 \nFigure 6.

The \nfollowing section s describe the effect of  gain, component values , \nand parasitics on  the performance of the ADA4891-1 /ADA4891 -2/ \nADA4891 -3/ADA4891-4 . The wideband, noninverting gain \nconfiguration of the ADA4891-1 /ADA4891-2 /ADA4891 -3/ \nADA4891-4  is shown in Figure 50; the wideband, inverting gain \nconfiguration of the ADA4891-1 /ADA4891-2 /ADA48 91-3/ \nADA4891-4  is shown in Figure 51. \nWIDEBAND, NONINVERTI NG GAIN OPERATIO N 08054-023ADA4891\nRF\nRGRT50Ω\nSOURCE\nRL+VS\n–VS10µF 0.1µF\nVI VO\n10µF 0.1µF\nF\nigure 50. Noninverting Gain Configuration \nIn Figure 50, R F and R G denote the f eedbac k and g ain resistor s, \nrespectively. T ogether, RF and R G determine the noise gain o f the \namplifier. Th e value of RF defines the 0.1 d B bandwidth ( for \nmore information, see  the E ffect of RF on 0.1 dB Gain Flatness \nsection ). Typical R F values r ange  from 549 Ω t o 698 Ω for the \nADA4891 -1/ADA4891 -2. Typical R F value s range from 301 Ω  \nto 453 Ω f or the ADA4891-3 /ADA4891-4 . \nI\nn a controlled impedance signal path, R T is used as the input \ntermination resistor designed to match the input source imped -\nance. Note that R T is not required f or normal operation . R T is \ngenerally set to match the  input source impedance.

For the \ninverting gain configuration, set the parallel combination of \nRT and RG to match the input source impedance.  \nNote that a bias current cancellation resistor is not required in the noninverting input of the amplifier  because the input  bias \ncurrent o f the ADA4891-1 /ADA4891 -2/ADA4891 -3/ADA4891-4  \nis very low (less than 2 pA). Therefore, the dc errors caused by \nthe bias current are negligible.  \nFor b oth noninverting a nd inverting g ain configurations, it is \noften u seful to increase the  RF value to d ecrease the load o n the \noutput. In creasing the R F value i mproves h armonic  distortion a t \nthe expense of reducing the 0.1 dB bandwidth of the amplifier. \nThis effe ct is discussed further in the Effect of R F on 0.1 dB Gain \nFlatness section .  \nRECOMMENDED VALUES  \nTable 5  and Table 6 provide a quick reference for  various configu -\nrations and show the ef fect of gain on the −3 dB small -signal  \nbandwidth, slew rate , and peaking of the ADA4891-1 /ADA4891 -2/ \nADA4891 -3/ADA4891-4 . Note that a s the gain increases, the \nsmall- signal bandwidth decreases , as is expected from the gain \nbandwidth product relationship. In addition, the phase margin improves with higher gains, and the amplifier becomes more \nstable. As a result, the peaking in the frequency response is reduced ( see Figure 7 and Figure 10). \nT\nable 5.

Tests have revealed that the \nhuman ey e is unable to distinguish brightness variations of  \nless than 1%, which translates into a 0.1 dB signal drop within \nthe pass band  or, put simply, 0.1 dB gain flatness.  \nThe PCB layout configuration and bond pads of the chip often contribute to stray capaci tance. The stray capacitance at the \ninverting input forms a pole with the feedback and gain resistor s. \nThis additional pole adds phase shift  and reduces phase margin  \nin the closed -loop phase response, causing instability in the \namplifier and peaking in the  frequency response.  \nFigure 52 and Figure 53 show the effect of using various values \nfor Feedback Resisto r R\nF on the 0.1 dB gain flatness  of the device s. \nFigure 52 shows the eff ect for the ADA4891-1 /ADA4891-2 . \nFigure 53 show the effect for the ADA4891 -3/ADA4891-4 . \nNote that a larger R F value causes more peaking because the \nadditional pole  formed by R F and the input stray capacitance \nshifts down in frequency and interacts significantly with the internal poles of the amplifi er. \n–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.2\n1 0.1 10 100\nFREQUENC Y (MHz)NORMALIZED CLOSED-LOO P GAIN (dB)\nVS = 5V\nG = +2\nVOUT = 2V p-p\nRL = 150ΩRG = R F = 604 Ω\nRG = R F = 549 ΩRG = R F = 649 ΩRG = R F = 698 Ω\n08054-022\nF\nigure 52. 0.1 dB Gain Flatness, Noninverting Gain Configuration ,  \nADA4891-1 /ADA4891-2  –0.4\n–0.5–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.3\n1 0.1 10 100\nFREQUENC Y (MHz)NORMALIZED CLOSED-LOO P GAIN (dB)\n08054-085VS = 5V\nG = +2\nVOUT = 2V p-p\nRL = 150ΩRG = R F = 453 Ω\nRG = R F = 402 Ω\nRG = R F = 357 Ω\nRG = R F = 301 Ω\nF\nigure 53. 0.1 dB Gain Flatness, Noninverting Gain Configuration,  \nADA4891-3 /ADA4891 -4 \nTo obtain  the desired 0.1 dB bandwidth, adjust the feedback \nresistor, R F, as shown in Figure 52  and Figure 53. If R F cannot  \nbe adjusted, a small capacitor  can be placed  in parallel with  RF \nto reduce peaking.  \nThe feedback capacitor, C F, forms a zero with the feedback \nresistor, which cancels out th e pole formed by the input stray \ncapacitance and the gain and feedback resistor s. For a first pass \nin determining the C F value, use the following equation : \nRG × CS = RF × CF \nwhere : \nRG is the gain resistor.  \nCS is the input stray capacitance . \nRF is the feedb ack resistor.  \nCF is the feedback capaci tor. \nUsing this equation, the original closed -loop frequency response of  \nthe amplifier is restored , as if there is no stray input capacitance. \nMost often, however, the value of C F is determined empirically.  \nFigure 54 shows the effect of using various values for the feedback \ncapacitor to reduce peaking. In this case, the ADA4891-1 / \nADA4891 -2 are used for demonstration purposes and R F = R G = \n604 Ω. The input stray capacitance, together with the board parasitics, is approximately 2 pF.  \nADA4891-1/ADA4891-2/ADA4891-3/ADA4891-4 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

F | Page 19 of 24 TERMINATING UNUSED AMPLIFIERS \nTerminating unused amplifiers in a multiamplifier package is  \nan important step in ensuring proper operation of the functional \namplifier. Unterminated amplifiers can oscillate and draw excessive power. The recommended procedure for terminating \nunused amplifiers is to connect any unused amplifiers in a \nunity-gain configuration and to connect the noninverting input to midsupply voltage. With symmetrical bipolar power supplies, this means connecting the noninverting input to ground, as \nshown in Figure 59. \n08054-064–VS+VS\nADA4891\n \nFigure 59. Terminating Unused Amplifier with  \nSymmetrical Bipolar Power Supplies \nIn single power supply applications, a synthetic midsupply \nsource must be created. This can be accomplished with a simple resistive voltage divider. Figure 60 shows the proper connection for terminating an unused amplifier in a single-supply \nconfiguration. \n08054-0652.5kΩ\n2.5kΩ+VS\nADA4891\n \nFigure 60. Terminating Unused Amplifier with Single Power Supply \nDISABLE FEATURE ( ADA4891-3  ONLY) \nThe ADA4891-3  includes a power-down feature that can be \nused to save power when an amplifier is not in use. When an \namplifier is powered down, its output goes to a high impedance state. The output impedance decreases as frequency increases; this effect can be observed in Figure 34. With the power-down function, a forward isolation of −40 dB can be achieved at \n50 MHz. Figure 46 shows the forward isolation vs. frequency \ndata. The power-down feature is asserted by pulling the PD1\n, \nPD2 , or PD3  pin low. \nTable 7 summarizes the operation of the power-down feature. \nTable 7.

Figure 61 shows the \nADA4891-3  configured as a single 5 V supply video driver. \n\uf0b7 The input signal is ac-coupled into the amplifier via \nCapacitor C1. \n\uf0b7 Resistor R2 and Resistor R4 establish the input midsupply \nreference for the amplifier. \n\uf0b7 Capacitor C5 prevents constant current from being drawn \nthrough the gain set resistor (R G) and enables the ADA4891-3  \nat dc to provide unity gain to the input midsupply voltage, thereby establishing the output voltage at midsupply. \n\uf0b7 Capacitor C6 is the output coupling capacitor. \nThe large-signal frequency response obtained with single-supply operation is identical to the bipolar supply operation \n(Figure 18 shows the large-signal frequency response). \nFour pairs of low frequency poles are formed by R2/2 and C2, \nR3 and C1, R\nG and C5, and R L and C6. With this configuration, \nthe −3 dB cutoff frequency at low frequency is 12 Hz. The values of C1, C2, C5, and C6 can be adjusted to change the low frequency −3 dB cutoff point to suit individual design needs. \nFor more information about single-supply operation of op amps, \nsee the Analog Dialogue article “ Avoiding Op Amp Instability Problems in Single-Supply Applications” (Volume 35, Number 2) \nat www.analog.com . \n08054-086C2\n1µF\nR2\n50kΩR4\n50kΩ\nR3\n100kΩ\nC1\n22µFR1\n50ΩC6\n22µF\nRL\n150Ω\nRG\n453ΩRF\n453Ω\nC5\n22µFADA4891-3+5V\nVOUTVIN\n–VSC3\n10µF\nC4\n0.01µF+5V\n \nFigure 61.

F | Page 20 of 24 VIDEO RECONSTRUCTION  FILTER  \nA common application for active filters is at the outp ut of video \ndigital -to-analog converters (DACs)/encoders. The filter, or more \nappropriately, the video reconstruction filter, is used at the output  \nof a video DAC/encoder to eliminate the multiple images that \nare created during the sampling process within the DAC. For portable video applications, the ADA4891 -1/ADA4891- 2/ \nADA4891 -3/ADA4891- 4 is an ideal choice due to its lower \npower requirements and high perfo rmance.  \nFor active filters , a good rule of thumb is that the − 3 dB band -\nwidth of the amplifiers be  at least 10 times higher than the corner  \nfrequency of the filter. This ensures that no initial roll -off is \nintroduced by the  amplifier  and that the pass  band is flat until \nthe cutoff frequency.  \nAn example of a  15 MHz, 3-pole , Sallen -Key, low -pass video \nreconstruction filter is shown in Figure 62. T his circuit features \na gain o f +2, a 0.1 dB bandwidth of 7 .3 MHz, an d over 17 dB \nattenuation at 29 .7 MHz (see Figure 63). T he filter has three \npoles : two poles are active , with a third passive pole (R6 and C4) \nplaced at the output. C3 improves the filter roll -off. R6, R7, and \nR8 make up  the video load of 150 Ω. Components R6, C4, R7, \nR8, and the input termination of the network analyzer form a 6 dB attenuator; therefore, the reference level is roughly 0  dB,  \nas shown in Figure 63. \nR2\n47Ω\nVINR3\n125Ω R6\n6.8Ω+5VR7\n68.1Ω\nR1C1\n51pF\nC3\n15pFC4\n1nF\nR4\n1kΩ\nR5\n1kΩR8\n75ΩVOUTC2\n51pF\n08054-062 \nFigure 62. 1 5 MHz Video Reconstruction Filter Schematic  \n \n–39–36–33–30–27–24–21–18–15–12–9–6–30\n0.03 0.1 1 10 100MAGNITUDE (dB)\nFREQUENCY (MHz)\n08054-059 \nFigure 63.

F | Page 21 of 24 LAYOUT, GROUNDING, AND BYPASSING \nPOWER SUPPLY BYPASSING \nPower supply pins are additional op amp inputs, and care must \nbe taken so that a noise-free, stable dc voltage is applied. The \npurpose of bypass capacitors is to create a low impedance path from the supply to ground over a range of frequencies, thereby \nshunting or filtering the majority of the noise to ground. Bypassing \nis also critical for stability, frequency response, distortion, and \nPSRR performance. \nIf traces are used between components and the package, chip \ncapacitors of 0.1 μF (X7R or NPO) are critical and should be placed as close as possible to the amplifier package. The 0508 case size for such a capacitor is recommended because it offers low series inductance and excellent high frequency performance. \nLarger chip capacitors, such as 0.1 μF capacitors, can be shared \namong a few closely spaced active components in the same signal path. A 10 μF tantalum capacitor is less critical for high frequency bypassing, but it provides additional bypassing for \nlower frequencies. \nGROUNDING \nWhen possible, ground and power planes should be used. Ground \nand power planes reduce the resistance and inductance of the \npower supply feeds and ground returns. If multiple planes are \nused, they should be stitched together with multiple vias. The returns for the input, output terminations, bypass capacitors, and R\nG should all be kept as close to the ADA4891-1 /ADA4891-2 / \nADA4891-3 /ADA4891-4  as possible. Ground vias should be \nplaced at the side or at the very end of the component mounting pads to provide a solid ground return. The output load ground and the bypass capacitor grounds should be returned to a common point on the ground plane to minimize parasitic \ninductance and to help improve distortion performance. \nINPUT AND OUTPUT CAPACITANCE \nParasitic capacitance can cause peaking and instability and, \ntherefore, should be minimized to ensure stable operation. \nHigh speed amplifiers are sensitive to parasitic capacitance between \nthe inputs and ground. A few picofarads of capacitance reduce \nthe input impedance at high frequencies, in turn increasing the \ngain of the amplifier and causing peaking of the frequency response or even oscillations, if severe enough. It is recommended that the external passive components that are connected to the input pins be placed as close as possible to the inputs to avoid \nparasitic capacitance. \nIn addition, the ground and power planes under the pins of  \nthe ADA4891-1 /ADA4891-2 /ADA4891-3 /ADA4891-4  should be \ncleared of copper to prevent parasitic capacitance between the \ninput and output pins to ground. This is because a single mounting pad on a SOIC footprint can add as much as 0.2 pF of capacitance to ground if the ground or power plane is not cleared under the ADA4891-1 /ADA4891-2 /ADA4891-3 / \nADA4891-4  pins. In fact, the ground and power planes should be kept at a distance of at least 0.05 mm from the input pins on \nall layers of the board. \nINPUT-TO-OUTPUT COUPLING \nTo minimize capacitive coupling between the inputs and outputs \nand to avoid any positive feedback, the input and output signal \ntraces should not be parallel. In addition, the input traces should not be close to each other. A minimum of 7 mils between the two inputs is recommended. \nLEAKAGE CURRENTS \nIn extremely low input bias current amplifier applications, stray \nleakage current paths must be kept to a minimum. Any voltage \ndifferential between the amplifier inputs and nearby traces sets up a leakage path through the PCB. Consider a 1 V signal and 100 GΩ to ground present at the input of the amplifier. The resultant leakage current is 10 pA; this is 5× the typical input bias current of the amplifier. Poor PCB layout, contamination, \nand the board material can create large leakage currents. Common \ncontaminants on boards are skin oils, moisture, solder flux, and cleaning agents. Therefore, it is imperative that the board be thoroughly cleaned and that the board surface be free of contaminants to take full advantage of the low input bias currents of the ADA4891-1 /ADA4891-2 / ADA4891-3 /ADA4891-4 . \nTo significantly reduce leakage paths, a guard ring/shield should \nbe used around the inputs. The guard ring circles the input pins \nand is driven to the same potential as the input signal, thereby reducing the potential difference between pins. For the guard ring to be completely effective, it must be driven by a relatively low impedance source and should completely surround the input \nleads on all sides, above and below, using a multilayer board \n(see Figure 66). \nNONINVERTINGGUARD RING\nINVERTINGGUARD RING\n08054-067 \nFigure 66. Guard Ring Configurations \nThe 5-lead SOT-23 package for the ADA4891-1  presents a \nchallenge in keeping the leakage paths to a minimum. The  \npin spacing is very tight, so extra care must be used when constructing the guard ring (see Figure 67 for the recom-\nmended guard ring construction). \n08054-068–IN +IN–VS –VS+VS+VS OUT\nADA4891-1\nNONINVERTING–IN +INOUT\nADA4891-1\nINVERTING  \nFigure 67.
