### Component Summary: Nexperia PUMD9

**General Description:**
The Nexperia PUMD9 is a resistor-equipped double transistor (RET) that includes both NPN and PNP transistors in a single package. It is designed in a compact SOT363 (SC-88) surface-mounted device (SMD) plastic package, making it suitable for space-constrained applications.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Collector-Emitter Voltage (V_CE): Up to 50 V
  - Collector-Base Voltage (V_CBO): Up to 50 V
  - Emitter-Base Voltage (V_EBO): Up to 6 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Current (I_O): 100 mA per transistor

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Total Power Dissipation (P_tot): 200 mW (per transistor) at ambient temperature (T_amb) ≤ 25 °C; 300 mW (per device)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Junction Temperature (T_j): -65 °C to +150 °C
  - Ambient Temperature (T_amb): -65 °C to +150 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - SOT363 (TSSOP6), 6 leads, dimensions: 2.1 mm x 1.25 mm x 0.95 mm

- **Special Features:**
  - Built-in bias resistors (R1 = 10 kΩ, R2 = 47 kΩ)
  - Simplifies circuit design and reduces component count
  - Cost-effective alternative to BC847/BC857 series in digital applications

- **Moisture Sensitive Level:**
  - Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL): Not specified in the provided data, but typically assessed according to JEDEC J-STD-020E.

**Description:**
The PUMD9 is a dual transistor device that integrates both NPN and PNP transistors with built-in biasing resistors. This integration allows for simplified circuit designs, reducing the number of external components required, which can lead to lower manufacturing costs and improved reliability.

**Typical Applications:**
- Digital applications in automotive and industrial segments
- Controlling IC inputs
- Switching loads
- Cost-saving alternative for traditional transistor configurations in digital circuits

This component is particularly useful in applications where space is limited and efficiency is critical, such as in automotive electronics, industrial control systems, and consumer electronics.
