The Future of Analog IC Technology\nDESCRIPTION \nThe MP62340/MP62341 Power Distribution \nSwitch features internal current limiting to \nprevent damage to host devices due to faulty \nload conditions. The MP62340/MP62341 \nanalog switch has 80m Ω on-resistance and \noperates from 2.7V to 5.5V input. It is available with guaranteed current limits, making it ideal for load switching applications. The \nMP62340/MP62341 has built-in protection for \nboth over current and increased thermal stress. \nFor over current, the device will limit the current by changing to a constant current mode. \nAs the temperature increases as a result of \nshort circuit, then the device will shut off. The device will recover once the device temperature \nreduces to approx 120 \uf0b0C. \nThe MP62340/MP62341 is available in 8-pin \nMSOP package with exposed pad and SOIC \npackage without exposed pad.

Patent Protected.  Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited. \n © 2019 MPS. All Rights Reserved. DETAILED DESCRIPTION \nOver Current \nWhen the load exceeds trip current (minimum \nthreshold current triggering constant-current mode) or a short is present, MP62340/MP62341 switches into to a constant-current mode (current limit value). MP62340/MP62341 will be shutdown only if the over current condition stays long enough to trigger thermal protection. \nTrigger over current protection for different \noverload conditions occurring in applications: \n1) The output has been shorted or overloaded \nbefore the device is enabled or input applied. MP62340/MP62341 detects the short or \noverload and immediately switches into a \nconstant-current mode. \n2) A short or an overload occurs after the device \nis enabled. After the current-limit circuit has been tripped (reached the trip current \nthreshold), the device switches into constant-\ncurrent mode. However, high current may \nflow for a short period of time before the \ncurrent-limit circuit can react. \n3）Output current has been gradually increased \nbeyond the recommended operating current. \nThe load current rises until the trip current \nthreshold is reached or until the thermal limit of the device is exceeded. MP62340/ MP62341 is capable of delivering current up to the trip current threshold without damaging the device. Once the trip threshold has been reached, the device switches into its constant-current mode. \nFlag Response \nThe FLAG pin is an open drain configuration. \nThis FAULT will report a fail mode after an 8ms deglitch timeout. This is used to ensure that no false fault signals are reported. This internal deglitch circuit eliminates the need for extend components. The FLAG pin is not deglitched \nduring an over temp. or voltage lockout. Thermal Protection  \nThe purpose of thermal protection is to prevent \ndamage in the IC by allowing exceptive current to flow and heating the junction. The die temp. is internally monitored until the thermal limit is reached. Once this temp. is reached, the switch will turn off and allow the chip to cool. The switch has a built-in hysteresis.   \nUnder-voltage Lockout (UVLO) \nThis circuit is used to monitor the input voltage to \nensure that the MP62340/MP62341 is operating \ncorrectly. This UVLO circuit also ensures that \nthere is no operation until the input voltage \nreaches the minimum spec. \nEnable  \nThe logic pin disables the chip to reduce the \nsupply current. The device will operate once the \nenable signal reaches the appropriate level. The \ninput is compatible with both COMS and TTL.  \nMP62340/MP62341 –CURRENT-LIMITED  POWER DISTRIBUTION SWITCHES \n \nMP62340/MP62341 Rev.1.11 www.MonolithicPower.com 10 \n7/16/2019 MPS Proprietary Information.

APPLICATION INFORMATION  \nPower-Supply Considerations \nOver 10 μF capacitor between IN and GND is \nrecommended. This precaution reduces power-\nsupply transients that may cause ringing on the input and improves the immunity of the device to \nshort-circuit transients.  \nIn order to achieve smaller output load transient, \nplacing a high-value electrolytic capacitor on the \noutput pin(s) is recommended when the output load is heavy. \nOUT2MP62340/\nMP62341OUT11\n2\n3\n4 5678+5V\nTo USB ControllerOutput 1\nOutput 2FLAG1\nFLAG2EN1*INGND\nEN2*\n \n* EN is active high for MP62341 \nFigure 3—Application Circuit \nMP62340/MP62341 –CURRENT-LIMITED  POWER DISTRIBUTION SWITCHES \n \nMP62340/MP62341 Rev.1.11 www.MonolithicPower.com 11 \n7/16/2019 MPS Proprietary Information.
