The AFBR-26x4Z/25x9Z receiver consists of an IC with an integrated photodiode to produce a logic compatible output. The transmitter input and receiver output are compatible with TTL logic families. The pair operates any type of signal from DC up to 50 MBd at distances up to 50 m with 1 mm POF, up to 200 m at 10 MBd and 120 m at 50 MBd with 200 \uf06dm Plastic-Clad Silica (PCS), respectively.\nThe transmitter is a 3-pin and the receiver is a 4-pin device, \npacked in Versatile Link housing. Versatile Link compo-nents can be interlocked (N-plexed together) to minimize space and to provide dual connections with the duplex connectors. Various simplex and duplex connectors, as well as POF cables are available for Versatile Link compo-nents.

Horizontal, Vertical, and Tilted (30°) packages are available. These low profi  le Versa tile Link packages are stackable and are \nenclosed to provide a dust-resistant seal. Snap action simplex, simplex latching, duplex, and duplex latching connectors are off  ered with simplex or duplex cables.\nPackage Orientation\nPerformance and pinouts for the horizontal, vertical, and \ntilted (30°) packages are identical. To provide addi tionalattachment support for the vertical Versatile Linkhousing, the designer has the option of using a self-tapping screw through a printed circuit board into a mounting hole at the bottom of the package. For most applications this is not necessary.\nPackage Housing Color\nVersatile Link components and simplex connectors are color coded to eliminate confusion when making con-nections. Receiver packages are black and transmitter packages are gray in color respectively.Handling\nVersatile Link components are auto-insertable. Whenwave soldering is performed with Versatile Link compo-nents, the optical port plug should be left in to prevent contamination of the port. Do not use refl  ow solder \nprocesses (i.e., infrared refl  ow or vapor-phase refl  ow). \nNonhalogenated water soluble fl  uxes (i.e., 0% chloride), \nnot rosin based fl  uxes, are recom mended for use with \nVersatile Link components.\nVersatile Link components are moisture sensitive \ndevices and are shipped in a moisture sealed bag. If thecomponents are exposed to air for an extended period of time, they may require a baking step before the solder ing process. Refer to the special labeling on the shipping tube for details.\nRecommended Chemicals for Cleaning/Degreasing\nAlcohols: methyl, isopropyl, isobutyl. Aliphatics: hexane, heptane. Other: soap solution, naphtha.\nDo not use partially halogenated hydrocarbons such \nas 1,1.1 trichloroethane, ketones such as MEK, acetone, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methylene dichloride, phenol, methylene chloride, or N-methylpyrolldone. Also, Avago does not recommend the use of cleaners that usehalogenated hydrocarbons because of their potential en-vironmental harm.\n3Mechanical Dimensions\nHorizontal Module Vertical Module\nTilted (30°) Module\n2[0.08]6.5[0.2\n6]0.6[0.03]\n7.7\n[0.30]\n7.6[0.30\n]18.8\n[0.74]\n2.8\n[0.11]\n 3\n.8[0.15\n]MAX\n.3.6[0.1\n4]M\nIN.5.1\n[0.20]4.2[0.1\n7]\n1.3\n[0.05]\n2.54\n[0.100]\n1.7\n[0.07]0.5\n[0.02]\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]\x870.6\n[\x870.03]\n10.2[0.40]\n2\n[0.08]18.9[0.75]3.3 [0.1\n3] MAX2.8 [0.1\n1] M\nIN\n0.5\n[0.02]2.54\n[0.100]1.3\n[0.05]7.6\n[0.30]\n1.7\n[0.07]\n0.6\n[0.02]\n3.8\n[0.15]\n3.8[0.1\n5]7.62\n[0.300]\n2)\n 18.1\n[0.71]\n5.1[0\n.20]10.2[0.4\n0]1\n[0.04]3.6\n[0.14]\n\x870.6\n[\x870.03]\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]\n2) Optional mounting hole for #2 self-tapping-screw\n    (metric equivalent M2.2 x 0.45)6.5\n[0.26]\nA\nA\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]\n6.5[0\n.2\n6]\n2[0\n.08\n]10\n.2[0\n.4\n0]\n18.7\n[0.74]6.6[0\n.26\n]\n15\n.2[0\n.60\n]\n7.62\n[0.300]2.54\n[0.100]0.5\n[0.02]1.3\n[0.05]\n4.6[0\n.18\n]\n0.\n6[0\n.03\n]\n10.1\n[0.40]8.7\n[0.34]\n19.3\n[0.76]1.1\n[0.05]\n2.2\n[0.09]\n4.\n6[0\n.18\n]0.4\n[0.02]30°\n0.7\n[0.03]\n4Versatile Link Printed Board Layout Dimensions\nHorizontal Module Vertical Module\nTilted (30°) Module7.62\n[0.300]\n2.54\n[0.100]7.7[0.30\n]\n1.9\n[0.07]PCB EDGE\nMIN.1 2 3 4\n8 5\nFootprint - TOP VIEW1\n[  \x87\x030.04]\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]\x877.62[0.300]3.8\n[0.15]\n3.8\n[0.15]7.62\n[0.300]\n2.54\n[0.100]\n2.25 [0.09] clearance hole \nfor optional vertical mount\nself-tapping-screw #2\nPCB EDGE\n1.7\n[0.07]MIN.1 2 3 4\n5 8\nFootprint - TOP VIEW\x871[0.04]\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]\x87\n2.54\n[0.100]7.62\n[0.300]8.7[0.34]\nPCB EDGE43 2 1\n8 5\nFootprint - TOP VIEW2.2\n[0.09]MIN.1[0.04]\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]\x87\n\x87\n5Interlocked (Stacked) Assemblies (refer to Figure 1)\nHorizontal packages may be stacked by placing units with pins facing upward.

This tech nique prevents potential harm that could occur to fi  ngers and hands of assemblers from the package pins. Stacked horizontal\npackages can be disengaged if necessary. Repeated stacking and unstack ing causes no damage to individual units.\nTo stack vertical packages, hold one unit in each hand, with the pins facing away and the optical ports on the bottom. \nSlide the L bracket unit into the L slot unit.
