Thepart contains an input multiplexer, an on-chip track/hold ampli-fier, a high speed 12-bit ADC, a 2.5 V reference, and a high\nspeed interface. The part operates from a single 5 V supply andaccepts a variety of analog input ranges across two models, theAD7891-1 ( ±5V and ±10 V) and the AD7891-2 (0 V to +2.5 V,\n0V to +5 V, and ±2.5 V).\nThe AD7891 provides the option of either a parallel or se rial\ninterface structure determined by the MODE pin. The part\nhas standard control inputs and fast data access times for both\nthe serial and parallel interfaces, ensuring easy interfacing to\nmodern microprocessors, microcontrollers, and digital signalprocessors.\nIn addition to the traditional dc accuracy specifications, such as\nlinearity, full-scale and offset errors, the part is also specified for\ndynamic performance parameters, including harmonic distortionand signal-to-noise ratio.\nPower dissipation in normal mode is 82 mW typical; in\nthe standby mode, this is reduced to 75 mW typ. The part is\navailable in a 44-terminal MQFP and a 44-lead PLCC.PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1.The AD7891 is a complete monolithic 12-bit data acquisition\nsystem that combines an 8-channel multiplexer, 12-bit ADC,\n2.5 V reference, and track/hold amplifier on a single chip.\n2. The AD7891-2 features a conversion time of 1.6 ms and an\nacquisition time of 0.4 ms. This allows a sample rate of\n500 kSPS when sampling one channel and 62.5 kSPS whenchannel hopping. These sample rates can be achieved usingeither a software or hardware convert start. The AD7891-1\nhas an acquisition time of 0.6 ms when using a hardware\nconvert start and an acquisition time of 0.7 ms when using a\nsoftware convert start. These acquisition times allow samplerates of 454.5 kSPS and 435 kSPS, respectively, for hardware\nand software convert start.\n3.Each channel on the AD7891 has overvoltage protection. Thismeans an overvoltage on an unselected channel does not affect\nthe conversion on a selected channel. The AD7891-1 can\nwithstand overvoltages of ±17 V.\n–2– REV.

All input signals  are measured with tr = tf = 1 ns (10% to\n90% of 5 V) and timed from a voltage level of 1.6 V.\n2See Figures 2, 3, and 4.\n3Measured with the load circuit of Figure 1 and defined as the time required for an output to cross 0.8 V or 2.4 V.\n4These times are derived from the measured time taken by the data outputs to change 0.5 V when loaded with the circuit of Figure 1. The measured number is then\nextrapolated back to remove the effects of charging or discharging the 50 pF capacitor. This means that the times quoted in the  timing characteristics are the true bus\nrelinquish times of the part and as such are independent of external bus loading capacitances.\nSpecifications subject to change without notice.\n1.6mA\n200/H9262A1.6VTO\nOUTPUT\nPIN50pF\nFigure 1.

DPIN FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS\nPLCC MQFP\nPin No. Pin No. Mnemonic Description\n1–52 8 –43 V INXA, VINXB Analog Input Channels. The AD7891 contains eight pairs of analog input channels. Each\n34–44 channel contains two input pins to allow a number of different input ranges to be used\nwith the AD7891. There are two pos sible input voltage ranges on the AD7891-1. The\n±5V input range is selected by connecting the input voltage to both V INXA and V INXB,\nwhile the ±10 V input range is selected by applying the input voltage to V INXA and con-\nnecting V INXB to AGND. The AD7891-2 has three possible input ranges. The 0 V to\n2.5 V input range is selected by connecting the analog input voltage to both V INXA and V INXB; the\n0V to 5 V input range is selected by applying the input voltage to V INXA and connecting\nVINXB to AGND while the ±2.5 V input range is selected by connecting the analog input\nvoltage to V INXA and connecting V INXB to REF IN (provided this REF IN voltage comes\nfrom a low impedance source). The channel to be converted is selected by the A2, A1,\nand A0 bits of the control register. In the parallel interface mode, these bits are available as\nthree data input lines (DB3 to DB5) in a parallel write operation. While in the serial inter-\nface mode, these three bits are accessed via the DATA IN line in a serial write operation.The multiplexer has guaranteed break-before-make operation.\n10, 19 4, 13 V\nDD Positive Supply Voltage, 5 V ± 5%.\n11, 33 5, 27 AGND Analog Ground.

TTL compatible input used to put the device into the power\nsave or standby mode. The STANDBY  input is high for normal operation and low for\nstandby operation.\n93 REF OUT/REF IN Voltage Reference Output/Input. The part can either be used with its own internal refer-\nence or with an external reference source. The on-chip  2.5 V reference voltage is pro-\nvided at this pin. When using this internal reference as the reference source for the\npart, REF OUT should be decoupled to REF GND with a 0.1 mF disc ceramic capaci-\ntor. The output impedance of the reference source is typically 2 k W. When using an\nexternal reference source as the reference voltage for the part, the reference source\nshould be connected to this pin. This overdrives the internal reference and provides thereference source for the part. The reference pin is buffered on-chip but must be able to\nsink or source current through this 2 k W resistor to the output of the on-chip reference.\nThe nominal reference voltage for correct operation of the AD7891 is 2.5 V.\n71 REF GND Reference Ground. Ground reference for the part ’s on-chip reference buffer. The REF\nOUT pin of the part should be decoupled with a 0.1 mF capacitor to this REF GND\npin. If the AD7891 is used with an external reference, the external reference should alsobe decoupled to this pin. The REF GND pin should be connected to the AGND pin\nor the system ’s AGND plane.\n30 24 CONVST Convert Start. Edge-triggered logic input.

Active low logic input used in conjunction with CS to latch the mul-\ntiplexer address and software control information. The rising edge of this input\nalso initiates an internal pulse. When using the software start facility, this pulse\ndelays the point at which the track/hold goes into hold and conversion is initiated.\nThis allows the multiplexer to settle and the acquisition time of the track/hold toelapse when a channel address is changed. If the SWCON bit of the control regis-\nter is set to 1, when this pulse times out, the track/hold then goes into hold and\nconversion is initiated. If the SWCON bit of the control register is set to 0, the\ntrack/hold and conversion sequence are unaffected by WR operation.\nData I/O Lines\nThere are 12 data input/output lines on the AD7891. When the part is configured for parallel mode (MODE = 1), the output datafrom the part is provided at these 12 pins during a read operation. For a write operation in parallel mode, these lines provide  access\nto the part ’s control register.\nParallel Read Operation\nDuring a parallel read operation, the 12 lines become the 12 data bits containing the conversion result from the AD7891. Thesedata bits are labelled Data Bit 0 (LSB) to Data Bit 11 (MSB). They are three-state, TTL compatible outputs. Output data codingis twos complement when the data FORMAT bit of the control register is 1, and straight binary when the data FORMAT bit of\nthe control register is 0.\nPLCC Pin No. MQFP Pin No. Mnemonic Description\n13 to 18, 7 to 12, DB0 to DB11 Data Bit 0 (LSB) to Data Bit 11 (MSB).

This is an active low logic inputwith RFS provided externally as a strobe or framing pulse to access serial data\nfrom the output register. For applications that require that data be transmittedand received at the same time, RFS and TFS should be connected to gether.\n21 15 DATA OUT Se rial Data Output. Sixteen bits of serial data are provided with the\ndata FORMAT bit and the three address bits of the control register\npreced ing the 12 bits of conversion data. Serial data is valid on the falling\nedge of SCLK for 16 edges after RFS goes low. Output conversion data\ncoding is twos complement when the FORMAT bit of the control register is\n1 and straight binary when the FORMAT bit of the control register is 0.\n17 11 DATA IN Serial Data Input. Serial data to be loaded to the control register is provided\nat this input. The first six bits of serial data are loaded to the controlregister on the first six falling edges of SCLK after TFS goes low. Serial\ndata on subsequent SCLK edges is ignored while TFS remains low.\n13, 14 7, 8 TEST T est Pin. When the device is configured for serial mode of operation,\ntwo of the pins which had been data inputs become test inputs. To ensurecorrect operation of the device, both TEST inputs should be tied to a\nlogic low potential.\nCONTROL REGISTER\nThe control register for the AD7891 contains six bits of information as described below. These six bits can be written to the c ontrol\nregister either in a parallel mode write operation or via a serial mode write operation. The default (power-on) condition of al l bits in\nthe control register is 0. Six serial clock pulses must be provided to the part in order to write data to the control register. If TFS\nreturns high before six serial clock cycles, no data transfer takes place to the control register and the write cycle has to be  restarted to\nwrite data to the control register. However, if the SWCONV bit of the register was previously set to a Logic 1 and TFS is brought\nhigh before six serial clock cycles, another conversion is initiated.\nA2 Address Input. This input is the most significant address input for multiplexer channel selection.\nA1 Address Input. This is the second most significant address input for multiplexer channel selection.A0 Address Input. Least significant address input for multiplexer channel selection. When the address is written to\nthe control register, an internal pulse is initiated to allow for the multiplexer settling time and track/hold acquisi-\ntion time before the track/hold goes into hold and conversion is initiated. When the internal pulse times out, the\ntrack/hold goes into hold and conversion is initiated. The selected channel is given by the formula\nAA A24 12 01¥+ ¥+ +\nSWCONV Conversion Start. Writing a 1 to this bit initiates a conversion in a similar manner to the CONVST  input. Con-\ntinuous conversion starts do not take place when there is a 1 in this location. The internal pulse and the conver-\nsion process are initiated when a 1 is written to this bit. With a 1 in this bit, the hardware conversion start, i.e.,\nthe CONVST  input, is disabled. Writing a 0 to this bit enables the hardware CONVST  input.\nSWSTBY Standby Mode Input. Writing a 1 to this bit places the device in its standby or power-down mode. Writing a 0 to\nthis bit places the device in its normal operating mode.\nFORMAT Data Format. Writing a 0 to this bit sets the conversion data output format to straight (natural) binary. This\ndata format is generally used for unipolar input ranges. Writing a 1 to this bit sets the conversion data outputformat to twos complement. This output data format is generally used for bipolar input ranges.)0BD(BSL\n2A1 A0 AV NOCWSY BTSWST AMROF\nAD7891\n–9– REV. DTERMINOLOGY\nSignal-to-(Noise + Distortion) Ratio\nThis is the measured ratio of signal to (noise + distortion) at the\noutput of the ADC. The signal is the rms amplitude of the\nfundamental. Noise is the rms sum of all nonfundamentalsignals up to half the sampling frequency (f\nS/2), excluding dc.\nThe ratio is dependent upon the number of quantization levelsin the digitization process; the more levels, the smaller the quan-tization noise. The theoretical signal-to-(noise +distortion) ratio\nfor an ideal N-bit converter with a sine wave input is given by\nSignal-to-(Noise + Distortion) = (6.02N + 1.76) dB\nTherefore, for a 12-bit converter, this is 74 dB.\nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)\nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of harmonics to the\nfundamental. For the AD7891, it is defined as\n    THD dB log() =++++2022222V VVVV\nV23456\n1\nwhere V1 is the rms amplitude of the fundamental and V2, V3,\nV4, V5 and V6 are the rms amplitudes of the second through the\nsixth harmonics.\nPeak Harmonic or Spurious Noise\nPeak harmonic or spurious noise is defined as the ratio of the rms\nvalue of the next largest component in the ADC output spectrum\n(up to f S/2 and excluding dc) to the rms value of the fundamental.\nNormally, the value of this specification is determined by the larg-\nest harmonic in the spectrum, but for parts where the harmonicsare buried in the noise floor, it is a noise peak.\nIntermodulation Distortion\nWith inputs consisting of sine waves at two frequencies, fa andfb, any active device with nonlinearities creates distortion\nproducts at sum and difference frequencies of mfa ± nfb, where\nm, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Intermodulation terms are those forwhich neither m nor n are equal to zero. For example, the\nsecon d-order terms include (fa + fb) and (fa – fb), while the\nthird-order terms include (2fa + fb), (2fa – fb), (fa + 2fb), and\n(fa – 2fb).\nThe AD7891 is tested using the CCIF standard where two\ninput frequencies near the top end of the input bandwidth are\nused. In this case, the second- and third-order terms are of\ndifferent significance. The second-order terms are usually dis-tanced in frequency from the original sine waves while the third-\norder terms are usually at a frequency close to the input\nfrequencies. As a result, the second- and-third order terms arespecified separately. The calculation of the intermodulation\ndistortion is as per the THD specification where it is the ratio of\nthe rms sum of the individual distortion products to the rmsamplitude of the fundamental expressed in dBs.Channel-to-Channel Isolation\nChannel-to-channel isolation is a measure of the level ofcrosstalk between channels. It is measured by applying a full-\nscale 20 kHz (AD7891-1) or 100 kHz (AD7891-2) sine wave\nsignal to one input channel and determining how much thatsignal is attenuated in each of the other channels. The figure\ngiven is the worst case across all eight channels.\nRelative Accuracy\nRelative accuracy or endpoint nonlinearity is the maximum\ndeviation from a straight line passing through the endpoints of\nthe ADC transfer function.\nDifferential Nonlinearity\nThis is the difference between the measured and the ideal 1 LSB\nchange between any two adjacent codes in the ADC.\nPositive Full-Scale Error (AD7891-1, /H1155010 V and /H115505 V;\nAD7891-2, /H115502.5 V)\nThis is the deviation of the last code transition (01. . .110 to01. . .111) from the ideal 4 ¥ REF IN – 3/2 LSB (AD7891-1\n±10 V range), 2 ¥ REF IN – 3/2 LSB (AD7891-1 ± 5V range),\nor REF IN – 3/2 LSB (AD7891-2, ±2.5 V range), after the\nbipolar zero error has been adjusted out.\nPositive Full-Scale Error (AD7891-2, 0 V to 5 V and 0 V to 2.5 V)\nThis is the deviation of the last code transition (11. . .110 to11. . .111) from the ideal 2 ¥ REF IN – 3/2 LSB (0 V to 5 V\nrange), or REF IN – 3/2 LSB (0 V to 2.5 V range), after the\nunipolar offset error has been adjusted out.\nBipolar Zero Error (AD7891-1, /H1155010 V and /H115505 V; AD7891-2, /H115502.5 V)\nThis is the deviation of the midscale transition (all 0s to all 1s)from the ideal AGND – 1/2 LSB.\nUnipolar Offset Error (AD7891-2, 0 V to 5 V and 0 V to 2.5 V)\nThis is the deviation of the first code transition (00. . .000 to\n00. . .001) from the ideal AGND + 1/2 LSB.\nNegative Full-Scale Error (AD7891-1, /H1155010 V and /H115505 V;\nAD7891-2, /H115502.5 V)\nThis is the deviation of the first code transition (10. . .000 to10. . .001) from the ideal –4 ¥ REF IN + 1/2 LSB (AD7891-1\n±10 V range), –2 ¥ REF IN + 1/2 LSB (AD7891-1 ± 5V range),\nor –REF IN + 1/2 LSB (AD7891-2, ±2.5 V range), after bipolar\nzero error has been adjusted out.\nTrack/Hold Acquisition Time\nTrack/hold acquisition time is the time required for the output of\nthe track/hold amplifier to reach its final value, within ±1/2 LSB,\nafter the end of conversion (the point at which the track/holdreturns to track mode). It also applies to situations where achange in the selected input channel takes place or where there\nis a step input change on the input voltage applied to the selected\nV\nIN input of the AD7891. It means the user must wait for the\nduration of the track/hold acquisition time after the end of\nconversion or after a channel change/step input change to V IN\nbefore starting another conversion, to ensure the part operates\nto specification.\nAD7891\n–10– REV. DINTERFACE INFORMATION\nThe AD7891 provides two interface options, a 12-bit parallel\ninterface and a high speed serial interface. The required inter-\nface mode is selected via the MODE pin. The two interface\nmodes are discussed in the following sections.\nParallel Interface Mode\nThe parallel interface mode is selected by tying the MODE\ninput to a logic high. Figure 2 shows a timing diagram illustrating\nthe operational sequence of the AD7891 in parallel mode for ahardware conversion start. The multiplexer address is written to\nthe AD7891 on the rising edge of the WR input. The on-chip\ntrack/hold goes into hold mode on the rising edge of CONVST ;\nconversion is also initiated at this point. When the conversion iscomplete, the end of conversion line ( EOC ) pulses low to indi-\ncate that new data is available in the AD7891 ’s output register.\nThis EOC  line can be used to drive an edge-triggered interrupt\nof a microprocessor. CS and RD going low accesses the 12-bit\nconversion result. In systems where the part is interfaced to a\ngate array or ASIC, this EOC  pulse can be applied to the CS\nand RD inputs to latch data out of the AD7891 and into the\ngate array or ASIC. This means the gate array or ASIC does not\nneed any conversion status recognition logic, and it also elimi-\nnates the logic required in the gate array or ASIC to generatethe read signal for the AD7891.\n t6  t7\n tCONV\n t1  t5\n t8 t1  t5\n t2\nVALID DATA\nOUTPUTVALID DATA\nINPUT t9 t10 t3\n t4CONVST  (I)\nEOC  (O)\nCS (O)\nWR (I)\nRD (I)\nDB0 TO DB11\n(I/O)\nNOTE\nI = INPUTO = OUTPUT\nFigure 2. Parallel Mode Timing DiagramCONVERTER DETAILS\nThe AD7891 is an 8-channel, high speed, 12-bit data acquisi-\ntion system. It provides the user with signal scaling, multiplexer,\ntrack/hold, reference, ADC, and high speed parallel and serial\ninterface logic functions on a single chip. The signal cond ition-\ning on the AD7891-1 allows the part to accept analog input\nranges of ±5V  or ±10 V when operating from a single supply.\nThe input circuitry on the AD7891-2 allows the part to handle\ninput signal ranges of 0 V to +2.5 V, 0 V to +5 V, and ±2.5 V\nagain while operating from a sin gle 5 V supply. The part req uires\na 2.5 V reference that can be provided from the part ’s own internal\nreference or from an external reference source.\nConversion is initiated on the AD7891 either by pulsing the\nCONVST  input or by writing a Logic 1 to the SWCONV bit of\nthe control register. When using the hardware CONVST  input,\nthe on-chip track/hold goes from track to hold mode and theconversion sequence is started on the rising edge of the CONVST\nsignal. When a software conversion start is initiated, an internal\npulse is generated, delaying the track/hold acquisition point and\nthe conversion start sequence until the pulse is timed out. This\ninternal pulse is initiated (goes from low to high) whenever awrite to the AD7891 control register takes place with a 1 in the\nSWCONV bit. It then starts to discharge and the track/hold\ncannot go into hold and conversion cannot be initiated until thepulse signal goes low. The internal pulse duration is equal to the\ntrack/hold acquisition time. This allows the user to obtain a\nvalid result after changing channels and initiating a conversionin the same write operation.\nThe conversion clock for the part is internally generated and\nconversion time for the AD7891 is 1.6 ms from the rising edge of\nthe hardware CONVST  signal. The track/hold acquisition time\nfor the AD7891-1 is 600 ns, while the track/hold acquisitiontime for the AD7891-2 is 400 ns. To obtain optimum perfor-\nmance from the part, the data read operation should not occur\nduring the conversion or during the 100 ns prior to the nextconversion. This allows the AD7891-1 to operate at throughput\nrates up to 454.5 kSPS and the AD7891-2 to operate at through-put rates up to 500 kSPS in the parallel mode and achieve datasheet specifications. In the serial mode, the maximum achievable\nthroughput rate for both the AD7891-1 and the AD7891-2 is\n357 kSPS (assuming a 20 MHz serial clock).\nAll unused analog inputs should be tied to a voltage within the\nnominal analog input range to avoid noise pickup. For mini-\nmum power consumption, the unused analog inputs should be\ntied to AGND.\nAD7891\n–11– REV. DSerial Interface Mode\nThe serial interface mode is selected by tying the MODE input\nto a logic low. In this case, five of the data/control inputs of the\nparallel mode assume serial interface functions.\nThe serial interface on the AD7891 is a 5-wire interface with\nread and write capabilities, with data being read from the outputregister via the DATA OUT line and data being written to the\ncontrol register via the DATA IN line. The part operates in a\nslave or external clocking mode and requires an externally applied\nserial clock to the SCLK input to access data from the data\nregister or write data to the control register. There are separateframing signals for the read ( RFS) and write ( TFS) operations.\nThe serial interface on the AD7891 is designed to allow the part\nto be interfaced to systems that provide a serial clock that is\nsynchronized to the serial data, such as the 80C51, 87C51,\n68HC11, and 68HC05, and most digital signal processors.\nWhen using the AD7891 in serial mode, the data lines DB11 to\nDB10 should be tied to logic low, and the CS, WR, and RD\ninputs should be tied to logic high. Pins DB4 to DB0 can be\ntied to either logic high or logic low but must not be left floating\nbecause this condition could cause the AD7891 to draw\nlarge am ounts of current.\nRead Operation\nFigure 3 shows the timing diagram for reading from the AD7891in serial mode. RFS goes low to access data from the AD7891.\nThe serial clock input does not have to be continuous. The serial\ndata can be accessed in a number of bytes. However, RFS mustremain low for the duration of the data transfer operation. Six-\nteen bits of data are transmitted in serial mode with the data\nFORMAT bit first, followed by the three address bits in the\ncontrol register, followed by the 12-bit conversion result starting\nwith the MSB. Serial data is clocked out of the device on therising edge of SCLK and is valid on the falling edge of SCLK.\nAt the end of the read operation, the DATA OUT line is three-\nstated by a rising edge on either the SCLK or RFS inputs, w hich-\never occurs first.\nWrite Operation\nFigure 4 shows a write operation to the control register of the\nAD7891. The TFS input goes low to indicate to the part that a\nserial write is about to occur. The AD7891 control register\nrequires only six bits of data. These are loaded on the first sixclock cycles of the serial clock with data on all subsequent clockcycles being ignored. Serial data to be written to the AD7891\nmust be valid on the falling edge of SCLK.\nSimplifying the Serial Interface\nTo minimize the number of interconnect lines to the AD7891\nin serial mode, the user can connect the RFS and TFS lines\nof the AD7891 together and read and write from the part simul-\ntaneously. In this case, a new control register data line selectingthe input channel and providing a conversion start command\nshould be provided on the DATA IN line, while the part pro-\nvides the result from the conversion just completed on the\nDATA OUT line.\nDATA OUT (O)SCLK (I)RFS (I)\n t18A\nNOTE\nI = INPUTO = OUTPUTFORMAT A2 A1 A0 DB11 DB10 DB0THREE-STATE t18\n t16  t15t14t12t11 t13  t17\nFigure 3.

DCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION\nReference\nThe AD7891 contains a single reference pin labeled REF OUT/\nREF IN that either provides access to the part ’s own 2.5 V\ninternal reference or to which an external 2.5 V reference can be\nconnected to provide the reference source for the part. The part\nis specified with a 2.5 V reference voltage. Errors in the reference\nsource result in gain errors in the transfer function of the AD7891\nand add to the specified full-scale errors on the part. They also\nresult in an offset error injected into the attenuator stage.\nThe AD7891 contains an on-chip 2.5 V reference. To use this\nreference as a reference source for the AD7891, simply connecta 0.1 mF disc ceramic capacitor from the REF OUT/REF IN pin\nto REFGND. REFGND should be connected to AGND or theanalog ground plane. The voltage that appears at the REF OUT/\nREF IN pin is internally buffered before being applied to the\nADC. If this reference is required for use external to the AD7891,it should be buffered since the part has a FET switch in serieswith the reference, resulting in a source impedance for this\noutput of 2 k W nominal. The tolerance of the internal reference\nis ±10 mV at 25 ∞C with a typical temperature coefficient of\n25 ppm/∞C and a maximum error over temperature of ±20 mV.\nIf the application requires a reference with a tighter toleranceor if the AD7891 needs to be used with a system reference, an\nexternal reference can be connected to the REF OUT/REF INpin. The external reference overdrives the internal reference\nand thus provides the reference source for the ADC. The refer-\nence input is buffered before being applied to the ADC andthe maximum input current is ±100 mA. Suitable reference for\nthe AD7891 include the AD580, the AD680, the AD780, and\nthe REF43 precision 2.5 V references.\nAnalog Input Section\nThe AD7891 is offered as two part types: the AD7891-1 where\neach input can be configured to have a ±10 V or a ±5 V input\nrange, and the AD7891-2 where each input can be configuredto have a 0 V to +2.5 V, 0 V to +5 V, and ±2.5 V input range.\nAD7891-1Figure 5 shows the analog input section of the AD7891-1. Each\ninput can be configured for ±5 V or ±10 V operation. For 5 V\noperation, the V\nINXA and V INXB inputs are tied together and the\ninput voltage is applied to both. For ±10 V operation, the V INXB\ninput is tied to AGND and the input voltage is applied to the\nVINXA input. The V INXA and V INXB inputs are symmetrical and\nfully interchangeable. Therefore, for ease of PCB layout on the±10 V range, the input voltage may be applied to the V\nINXB\ninput while the V INXA input is tied to AGND.\n30k/H9024\nVINXA\nVINXB\nAGNDTO\nMULTIPLEXER\nAD7891-12k/H9024REF OUT/REF IN\nTO ADC\nREFERENCE CIRCUITRY\n7.5k/H9024\n30k/H9024\n15k/H90242.5V\nREFERENCE\nFigure 5. AD7891-1 Analog Input StructureThe input resistance for the ±5 V range is typically 20 k W. For\nthe ±10 V input range, the input resistance is typically 34.3 k W.\nThe resistor input stage is followed by the multiplexer, which is\nfollowed by the high input impedance stage of the track/hold\namplifier.\nThe designed code transitions take place midway between suc-\ncessive integer LSB values (i.e., 1/2 LSB, 3/2 LSBs, 5/2 LSBs).\nLSB size is given by the formula 1 LSB = F S/4096. Therefore, for\nthe ±5 V range, 1 LSB = 10 V/4096 = 2.44 mV. For the ±10 V\nrange, 1 LSB = 20 V/4096 = 4.88 mV. Output coding is deter-mined by the FORMAT bit of the control register. The ideal\ninput/output code transitions are shown in Table I.\nAD7891-2\nFigure 6 shows the analog input section of the AD7891-2. Each\ninput can be configured for input ranges of 0 V to +5 V, 0 V to +2.5 V,\nor ±2.5 V. For the 0 V to 5 V input range, the V\nINXB input is\ntied to AGND and the input voltage is applied to the V INXA input.\nFor the 0 V to 2.5 V input range, the V INXA and V INXB inputs\nare tied together and the input voltage is applied to both. Forthe ±2.5 V input range, the V\nINXB input is tied to 2.5 V and\nthe input voltage is applied to the V INXA input. The 2.5 V source\nmust have a low output impedance. If the internal reference onthe AD7891 is used, it must be buffered before being applied to\nV\nINXB. The V INXA and V INXB inputs are symmetrical and fully\ninterchangeable. Therefore, for ease of PCB layout on the 0 V to +5 V\nor ±2.5 V range, the input voltage may be applied to the V INXB\ninput, while the V INXA input is tied to AGND or 2.5 V.\n1.8k/H9024\nVINXA\nVINXB\nAGNDTO\nMULTIPLEXER\nAD7891-22k/H9024REF OUT/REF IN\nTO ADC\nREFERENCE\nCIRCUITRY\n1.8k/H9024 2.5V\nREFERENCE\nFigure 6. AD7891-2 Analog Input Structure\nThe input resistance for both the 0 V to +5 V and ±2.5 V ranges\nis typically 3.6 k W. When an input is configured for 0 V to 2.5 V\noperation, the input is fed into the high impedance stage of the\ntrack/hold amplifier via the multiplexer and the two 1.8 k W\nresistors in parallel.\nThe designed code transitions occur midway between successive\ninteger LSB values (i.e., 1/2 LSB, 3/2 LSBs, 5/2 LSBs). LSB size\nis given by the formula 1 LSB = F S/4096. Therefore, for the 0 V\nto 5 V range, 1 LSB = 5 V/4096 = 1.22 mV, for the 0 V to 2.5 V\nrange, 1 LSB = 2.5 V/4096 = 0.61 mV, and for the ±2.5 V range,\n1 LSB = 5 V/4096 = 1.22 mV.

REF IN  is the reference voltage applied to the AD7891.\nAD7891\n–14– REV. DTrack/Hold Amplifier\nThe track/hold amplifier on the AD7891 allows the ADC to\naccur ately convert an input sine wave of full-scale amplitude\nto 12-bit accuracy. The input bandwidth of the track/hold is\ngreater than the Nyquist rate of the ADC even when the ADC isoperated at its maximum throughput rate of 454 kHz (AD7891-1)\nor 500 kHz (AD7891-2). In other words, the track/hold ampli fier\ncan handle input frequencies in excess of 227 kHz (AD7891-1)or 250 kHz (AD7891-2).\nThe track/hold amplifier acquires an input signal in 600 ns\n(AD7891-1) or 400 ns (AD7891-2). The operation of the track/\nhold is essentially transparent to the user. The track/hold ampli fier\ngoes from its tracking mode to its hold mode on the rising edge\nof CONVST . The aperture time for the track/hold (i.e., the\ndelay between the external CONVST  signal and the track/hold\nactually going into hold) is typically 15 ns. At the end of conver sion,\nthe part returns to its tracking mode. The track/hold starts ac quiring\nthe next signal at this point.\nSTANDBY  Operation\nThe AD7891 can be put into power save or standby mode byusing the STANDBY  pin or the SWSTBY bit of the control\nregister. Normal operation of the AD7891 takes place when the\nSTANDBY  input is at a Logic 1 and the SWSTBY bit is at a\nLogic 0. When the STANDBY  pin is brought low or a 1 is writ-\nten to the SWSTBY bit, the part goes into its standby mode ofoperation, reducing its power consumption to typically 75 mW.\nThe AD7891 is returned to normal operation when the\nSTANDBY  input is at a Logic 1 and the SWSTBY bit is a\nLogic 0. The wake-up time of the AD7891 is normally determ ined\nby the amount of time required to charge the 0.1 mF capacitor\nbetween the REF OUT/REF IN pin and REF GND. If theinternal reference is being used as the reference source, this\ncapacitor is charged via a nominal 2 k W resistor. Assuming 10\ntime constants to charge the capacitor to 12-bit accuracy, thisimplies a wake-up time of 2 ms.\nIf an external reference is used, this must be taken into account\nwhen working out how long it will take to charge the capacitor.If the external reference has remained at 2.5 V during the time\nthe AD7891 was in standby mode, the capacitor will already be\ncharged when the part is taken out of standby mode. Therefore,\nthe wake-up time is now the time required for the internal\ncircuitry of the AD7891 to settle to 12-bit accuracy. This typi-\ncally takes 5 ms. If the external reference was also put into\nstandby then the wake-up time of the reference, combined with\nthe amount of time taken to recharge the reference capacitor\nfrom the external reference, determines how much time mustelapse before conversions can begin again.\nMICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING\nAD7891 to 8X51 Serial Interface\nA serial interface between the AD7891 and the 8X51\nmicro controller is shown in Figure 7. TXD of the 8X51 drives\nSCLK of the AD7891, while RXD transmits data to and\nreceives data from the part. The serial clock speed of the 8X51 is\nslow compared to the maximum serial clock speed of the\nAD7891, so maximum throughput of the AD7891 is notachieved with this interface.8X51 *\nDATA OUTAD7891\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYSCLK\nDATA INRFS\nTFSP3.4\nP3.3\nTXD\nRXD*\nFigure 7. AD7891 to 8X51 Interface\nThe 8X51 provides the LSB of its SBUF register as the first bit\nin the serial data stream. The AD7891 expects the MSB of the\n6-bit write first. Therefore, the data in the SBUF register mustbe arranged correctly so that this is taken into account. When\ndata is to be transmitted to the part, P3.3 is taken low. The\n8X51 transmits its data in 8-bit bytes with only eight fallingclock edges occurring in the transmit cycle. One 8-bit transfer\nis needed to write data to the control register of the AD7891.\nAfter the data has been transferred, the P3.3 line is taken highto complete the transmission.\nWhen reading data from the AD7891, P3.4 of the 8X51 is taken\nlow. Two 8-bit serial reads are performed by the 8X51, and\nP3.4 is taken high to complete the transfer. Again, the 8X51expects the LSB first, while the AD7891 transmits MSB first, so\nthis must be taken into account in the 8X51 software.\nNo provision has been made in the given interface to determine\nwhen a conversion has ended. If the conversions are initiated bysoftware, the 8X51 can wait a predetermined amount of timebefore reading back valid data. Alternately, the falling edge of\nthe EOC  signal can be used to initiate an interrupt service\nroutine that reads the conversion result from part to part.\nAD7891 to 68HC11 Serial Interface\nFigure 8 shows a serial interface between the AD7891 and the68HC11 microcontroller. SCK of the 68HC11 drives SCLK of\nthe AD7891, the MOSI output drives DATA IN of theAD7891, and the MISO input receives data from D ATA OUT\nof the AD7891. Ports PC6 and PC7 of the 68HC11 drive theTFS and RFS lines of the AD7891, respectively.\nFor correct operation of this interface, the 68HC11 should be\nconfigured such that its CPOL bit is a 1 and its CPHA bit is a 0.\nWhen data is to be transferred to the AD7891, PC7 is taken\nlow. When data is to be received from the AD7891, PC6 is\ntaken low. The 68HC11 transmits and receives its serial data in\n8-bit bytes, MSB first. The AD7891 also transmits and receives\ndata MSB first. Eight falling clock edges occur in a read or writecycle from the 68HC11. A single 8-bit write with PC7 low is\nrequired to write to the control register. When data has beenwritten, PC7 is taken high. When reading from the AD7891,PC6 is left low after the first eight bits have been read. A second\nbyte of data is then transmitted serially from the AD7891. When\nthis transfer is complete, the PC6 line is taken high.\nAD7891\n–15– REV. DAs in the 8X51 circuit in Figure 7, the way the 68HC11 is\ninformed that a conversion is completed is not shown in thediagram. The EOC  line can be used to inform the 68HC11\nthat a conversion is complete by using it as an interrupt signal.The interrupt service routine reads in the result of the conver-sion. If a software conversion start is used, the 68HC11 can\nwait for 2.0 ms (AD7891-2) or 2.2 ms (AD7891-1) before read-\ning from the AD7891.\n68HC11 *\nDATA OUTAD7891 *\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITYSCLK\nDATA INRFS\nTFSPC7\nPC6\nSCK\nMOSI\nMOSO\nFigure 8.

In the interface shown, either SPORT0 or SPORT1\ncan be used to transfer data to the AD7891. When readingfrom the part, the SPORT must be set up with a serial word\nlength of 16 bits.

Other setups for theserial interface on the ADSP-21xx internal SCLK use alternate\nframing mode and active low framing signal.

DPARALLEL INTERFACING\nThe parallel port on the AD7891 allows the device to be inter faced\nto microprocessors or DSP processors as a memory m apped\nor I/O mapped device. The CS and RD inputs are common to\nall memory peripheral interfacing. Typical interfaces to different\nprocessors are shown in Figures 12 to 15.

A single wait state\nmay be necessary to interface the AD7891 to the ADSP-21xxdepen ding on the clock speed of the DSP. This wait state can\nbe programmed via the data memory wait state control registerof the ADSP-21xx (please see the ADSP-2100 family UsersManual for details).

AD7891 to TMS32020/TMS320C25/TMS320C5x\nParallel InterfaceThe parallel interface on the AD7891 is fast enough to interface\nto the TMS32020 with no extra wait states. If high speed gluelogic, such as 74AS devices, are used to drive the WR and RD\nlines when interfacing to the TMS320C25, then again no waitstates are necessary. However, if slower logic is used, data ac cesses\nmay be slowed sufficiently when reading from and writing to the\npart to require the insertion of one wait state. In such a case,\nthis wait state can be generated using the single OR gate tocombine the CS and MSC  signals to drive the READY line of\nthe TMS320C25, as shown in Figure 13. Extra wait states arenecessary when using the TMS320C5x at their fastest clockspeeds. Wait states can be programmed via the IOWSR and\nCWSR registers (see the TM S320C5x User Guide for details).\nData is read from the ADC using the following instruction:\nIN D, ADC\nwhere D is the memory location where the data is to be stored,\nand ADC  is the I/O address of the AD7891.\nAD7891 to TMS320C3x\nFigure 14 shows a parallel interface between the AD7891 andthe TMS320C3x family of DSPs.

AD7891 to DSP5600x Parallel Interface\nPower Supply Bypassing and Grounding\nIn any circuit where accuracy is important, careful consideration\nof the power supply and ground return layout helps to ensurethe specified performance. The PCB on which the AD7891 is\nmounted should be designed such that the analog and digital\nsections are separated and confined to certain areas of the board.\nThis facilitates the use of ground planes that can be separated\neasily. A minimum etch technique is generally best for ground\nplanes because it gives the best shielding. Digital and analogground planes should be joined at only one place. If the AD7891\nis the only device requiring an AGND to DGND connection,\nthen the ground planes should be connected at the AGND andDGND pins of the AD7891. If the AD7891 is in a system where\nmultiple devices require an AGND to DGND connection, the\nconnection should still be made at one point only, a star groundpoint established as close as possible to the AD7891.Digital lines running under the device should be avoided becausethese couple noise onto the die. T he analog ground plane should\nbe allowed to run under the AD7891 to avoid noise coupling.\nThe power supply lines of the AD7891 should use as large a\ntrace as possible to provide low impedance paths and reduce theeffects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching sig-\nnals like clocks should be shielded with digital ground to avoid\nradiating noise to other parts of the board and should never berun near the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital and analog\nsignals. Traces on opposite sides of the board should run at right\nangles to each other. This reduces the effects of feedthrough\nthrough the board. A microstrip technique is by far the best\ntechnique but is not always possible with a double-sided board.In this technique, the component side of the board is dedicatedto ground plane while signal traces are placed on the solder side.\nThe AD7891 should have ample supply bypassing located as close\nto the package as possible, ideally right up against the device.\nOne of the V\nDD pins (Pin 10 of the PLCC package and Pin 4\non the MQFP package) mainly drives the analog circuitry on\nthe chip. This pin should be decoupled to the analog ground\nplane with a 10 mF tantalum bead capacitor in parallel with a\n0.1 mF capacitor. The other V DD pin (Pin 19 on the PLCC\npackage and Pin 13 on the MQFP package) mainly drives\ndigital circuitry on the chip. This pin should be decoupled to the\ndigital ground plane with a 0.1 mF capacitor. The 0.1 mF\ncapacitors should have low effective series resistance (ESR) and\neffective series inductance (ESI), such as the common ceramic\ntypes or surface mount types, which provide a low impedance\npath to ground at high frequencies to handle transient currents\ndue to internal logic switching.

Recommended Decoupling Scheme for\nthe AD7891\nAD7891\n–18– REV. DAD7891 PERFORMANCE\nLinearity\nThe linearity of the AD7891 is primarily determined by the\non-chip 12-bit DAC. This is a segmented DAC that is laser\ntrimmed for 12-bit integral linearity and differential linearity.Typical INL for the AD7891 is ±0.25 LSB while typical DNL\nis ±0.5 LSB.\nNoise\nIn an ADC, noise exhibits itself as code uncertainty in dc appli-cations and as the noise floor (in an FFT for example) in ac\napplications. In a sampling ADC, such as the AD7891, all\ninformation about the analog input appears in the baseband from\ndc to half the sampling frequency. The input bandwidth of the\ntrack/hold amplifier exceeds the Nyquist bandwidth and,\ntherefore, an antialiasing filter should be used to removeunwanted signals above f\nS/2 in the input signal in applications\nwhere such signals exist.\nFigure 17 shows a histogram plot for 16384 conversions of a dc\ninput signal using the AD7891-1. The analog input was set atthe center of a code transition in the following way. An initial dc\ninput level was selected and a number of conversions were\nmade. The resulting histogram was noted and the applied levelwas adjusted so that only two codes were generated with an\nequal number of occurrences. This indicated that the transitionpoint between the two codes had been found. The voltage levelat which this occurred was recorded. The other edge of one of\nthese two codes was then found in a similar manner. The dc\nlevel for the center of code could then be calculated as the\naverage of the two transition levels. The AD7891-1 inputs\nwere configured for the ±5 V input range and the data was read\nfrom the part in parallel mode after conversion. Similar resultshave been found with the AD7891-1 on the ±10 V range and on\nall input ranges of the AD7891-2. The same performance is\nachieved in serial mode, again with the data read from theAD7891-1 after conversion. All the codes, except for 3, appearin one output bin, indicating excellent noise performance from\nthe ADC.\nOUTPUT CODE18000\n16000\n0\n2148 2149NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES\n21508000\n6000\n4000\n200012000\n100001400016381 CODES\n1 CODE 2 CODES\nFigure 17. Typical Histogram Plot (AD7891-1)Dynamic Performance\nThe AD7891 contains an on-chip track/hold amplifier, allowing\nthe part to sample input signals of up to 250 kHz on any of its\ninput channels. Many of the AD7891 ’s applications require it to\nsequence through low frequency input signals across its eight\nchannels. There may be some applications, however, for which\nthe dynamic performance of the converter on signals of up to\n250 kHz input frequency is of interest. It is recommended forthese wider bandwidth signals that the hardware conversion\nstart method of sampling is used.\nThese applications require information on the spectral content\nof the input signal. Signal-to-(noise + distortion), totalharmonic distortion, peak harmonic or spurious tone, and\nintermodulation distortion are all specified. Figure 18 shows a\ntypical FFT plot of a 10 kHz, ±10 V input after being digitized\nby the AD7891-1 operating at 500 kHz, with the input connected\nfor ±10 V operation. The signal-to-(noise + distortion) ratio is\n72.2 dB and the total harmonic distortion is –87 dB. Figure 19\nshows a typical FFT plot of a 100 kHz, 0 V to 5 V input afterbeing digitized by the AD7891-2 operating at 500 kHz, with the\ninput connected for 0 V to 5 V operation. The signal-to-(noise +\ndistortion) ratio is 71.17 dB and the total harmonic distortion\nis –82.3 dB. It should be noted that reading from the part\nduring conver sion does have a significant impact on dynamic\nperformance. Therefore, for sampling applications, it isrecommended not to read during conversion.\n0\n–30\n–150dB–60\n–90\n–120\nFS/22048 POINT FFT\nSNR = 72.2dB\nFigure 18.

DEffective Number of Bits\nThe formula for signal-to-(noise + distortion) ratio (see Terminology\nsection) is related to the resolution or number of bits of the\nconverter. Rewriting the formula gives a measure of perfor mance\nexpressed in effective number of bits (ENOB).\nENOB SNR =-() 17 6 60 2./ .\nwhere SNR is the signal-to-(noise + distortion) ratio.\nThe effective number of bits for a device can be calculated from\nits measured SNR. Figure 20 shows a typical plot of effectivenumber of bits versus frequency for the AD7891-1 and the\nAD7891-2 from dc to 200 kHz. The sampling frequency is500 kHz. The AD7891-1 inputs were configured for ±10 V\noperation. The AD7891-2 inputs were configured for 0 to 5 V\noperation. The AD7891-1 plot only goes to 100 kHz as a\n±10 V sine wave of sufficient quality was unavailable at higher\nfrequencies.\nFigure 20 shows that the AD7891-1 converts an input sine wave of\n100 kHz to an effective number of bits of 11 which equates to a\nsignal-to-(noise + distortion) level of 68.02 dBs. The AD7891-2converts an input sine wave of 200 kHz to an effective number\nof bits of 11.07, which equates to a signal-to-(noise + distortion)\nlevel of 68.4 dBs.FREQUENCY – kHz12.0\n11.9\n11.1\n40 80 12011.5\n11.4\n11.311.211.7\n11.611.8\n20 06 0 100 140 160 180 20011.0EFFECTIVE NUMBER OF BITSAD7891-2 ENOB\nAD7891-1 ENOB\nFigure 20.
