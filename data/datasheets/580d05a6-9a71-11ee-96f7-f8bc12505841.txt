Position the oscilloscope probe \nbetween 51mm and 76mm (2in and 3in) from the \nmodule   \nFigure5. Output Ripple and Noise T est Setup \n \nDesign Considerations \nInput filtering \nThe power module should be connected to a low ac-impedance input source. Highly inductive source impedances \ncan affect the stability of the power module. For the test configuration in Figure4 a 47µF electrolytic capacitor (ESR< \n0.7Ω at 5Hz to 20MHz), mounted close to the power module \nhelps ensure stability of the unit.   \n \n Safety Considerations  \nFor safety-agency approval of the system in which the power \nmodule is used, the power module must be installed in compliance with the spacing and separation requirements of \nthe end-use safety agency standard, i.e. CAN/CSA-C22.2, \nNo. 60950-1 and IEC60950-1, and also compliance with \nUL62368-1, CAN/CSA C22.2 No. 62368-1-14, EN62368-1 \nand IEC62368-1, if the system in which the power module is \nto be used must meet safety agency requirements. \n \nFor all input voltages, other than DC mains, where the input voltage is less than 60Vdc, if the input meets all of the \nrequirements for SELV, the output is considered to remain \nwith SELV limits. Signal component failure and fault tests \nwere performed in the power converters. \n If the input source is non-SELV (ELV or hazardous voltage \ngreater than 60Vdc and less than or equal to 75Vdc), for the \nmodule’s output to be considered as meeting the requirements for safety extra-low voltage (SELV), all of the \nfollowing must be true. \n\uf06e The input source is to be provided with reinforced \ninsulation from any other hazardous voltage, including \nthe AC mains. \n\uf06e One V\nIN pin and one V OUT pin are to be grounded, or \nboth the input and output pins are to be kept floating. \n\uf06e The input pins of the module are not operator \naccessible. \n\uf06e Another SELV reliability test is conducted on the whole \nsystem as required by the safe ty agencies, to verify that \nunder a single fault, hazardous voltages do not appear \nat the module’s output. \nAll flammable materials used in the manufacturing of these \nmodules are rated 94V-0.  \nT o preserve maximum flexibility , internal fusing is not included, \nhowever, to achieve maximum safety and system protection, \nalways use an input line fuse. The safety agencies require a \ntime delay fuse with a maximum rating of 20A. Based on the \ninformation provided in this data sheet on inrush energy and \nmaximum dc input current, the same type of fuse with a lower rating can be used. Refer to the fuse manufacturer’s data \nsheet for further information. \n \n \n \n \n  \n D o c u m e n t  N o . S L N 1 A 9 6 .

Two remote on/off logic are available. Negative logic turns the module on when the REM \npin is at logic low and off when it is at logic high. Positive \nlogic turns the module on during logic high and off during \nlogic low. \n T o turn the power module on and off, the user must supply a \nswitch to control the voltage between the REM pin and -Vin \nterminal (see Figure 8). A logic low is V\nREM =0 to 1.2 V . During logic high, the maximum V REM voltage generated by the \npower module is 20V .  \nIf not using the remote on/off feature, perform one of the following to turn the converter on: \nFor negative logic, short REM pin to -Vin.  \nFor positive logic, leave REM pin open. \n \n \nFigure8. Remote On/Off Implementation \n \nRemote Sense \nRemote sense minimizes the e ffects of distribution losses \nby regulating the voltage at the remote sense connections \n(see Figure 9. The voltage between the remote sense pins \nand the output terminals must not exceed the output voltage sense range ( ≤5% Vo(nom)). The voltage between \nthe +V\nO1 and GND terminals must not exceed the minimum \noutput over voltage protection value shown in the Electrical \nSpecifications table. This limit includes any increase in \nvoltage due to remote sense compensation and output \nvoltage programming (trim). If not using the remote sense \nfeature to regulate the output at the point of load, then \nconnect +S to +V O1 and -S to GND.  \n \nAlthough the output voltage can be increased by both the \nremote sense and by the trim, the maximum increase for \nthe output voltage is not the sum of both. The maximum \nincrease is the larger of either  the remote sense or the trim. \nThe amount of power delivered by the module is defined as \nthe voltage at the output terminals multiplied by the output \ncurrent. When using remote sense and trim, the output voltage of the module can be increased, at the same time \noutput current would increase the power output of the \nmodule. Care should be taken to ensure that the maximum \noutput power of the module remains at or below the \nmaximum rated power. 10.811.612.413.214\n36 37 42 48 75Output voltage(V)\nInput voltage(V)\nno load half load full load\n10.51111.51212.51313.5\n36 37 42 48 75Output voltage(V)\nInput voltage(V)\nno load half load full load\n \n  \n D o c u m e n t  N o .

Circuit Configuration for Remote Sense \n \nOutput Voltage Programming \nOutput voltage trim allows the user to increase or decrease \nthe output voltage set point of a module. This is accomplished by connecting an external resistor between the \nTRIM pin and either the +S or -S pins. If not using the trim \nfeature, leave the TRIM pin open.  \nTo increase the output voltage, refer to Figure 10, a trim \nresistor, R\ntrimup is connected between the TRIM and +S. \n\uf028\uf029\uf057 \uf02d\uf044\uf02d\uf044\uf044\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d kxV\nTrimupRout)22.10%11.5\n%225.1%111.5(  \ntrimupR= Required value of trim-up resistor [k Ω] \n%100 % \uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d\uf044\nOUTOUT trimup\nVV V\n \nOUTV   = Nominal value of output voltage [V] \ntrimupV= Desired (trimmed) output voltage [V]. \n \nFigure10.

PG is asserted when the module’s output voltage is above the \nPOWER_GOOD_ON value, and PG is de-asserted if any \ncondition such as overtemperature, overcurrent or loss of \nregulation occurs that would result in the output voltage \ngoing below the POWER_GOOD_OFF value.   The PG signal, provided on pin C2, is implemented with an \nopen-drain node, pulled up via a 10k Ω resistor to 3.3V \ninternally.

At the point of current limit in ception, the unit enters hiccup \nmode. The unit is configured with the auto-restart function, it \nwill remain in the hiccup mode as long as the overcurrent \ncondition exists, it operates normally once the output current \nis reduced back into its specified range. \n \nOutput Over Voltage Protection \nThe output over voltage protection consists of circuitry that \nmonitors the voltage on the output terminals. When the \noutput voltage exceeds the overvoltage protection threshold, the module will operate in a hiccup mode until overvoltage \ncause is cleared. \nOver Temperature Protection \nTo provide protection under certain fault conditions, the \nmodule is equipped with a thermal shutdown circuit. The module will shutdown when the heatsink temperature \nexceeds OTP set value, but the thermal shutdown is not \nintended as a guarantee that the module will survive when the temperatures beyond its rating. The module will \nautomatically restarts after it cools down. \n \n \n Figure 12  Tref Temperature Measurement Location  \n \nInput Under Voltage Lockout \nInput undervoltage lockout is standard with this converter, \nwhen input voltages below the input undervoltage lockout \nlimit, the module operation is disabled. It will only begin to operate once the input voltage is raised above the undervoltage lockout turn-on threshold.  \nThermal Considerations \nThe power modules operate in a variety of thermal \nenvironments; however, sufficient cooling should be provided \nto help ensure reliable operation of the unit. Considerations include ambient temperature, airflow, module \npower dissipation, and the need for increased reliability. A \nreduction in the operating temperature of the module will \nresult in an increa se in reliability.  \n \nHeat Transfer via Convection \nIncreasing airflow over the module enhances the heat \ntransfer via convection.

The residues may affect long time reliability and \nisolation voltage. \n \nEMC Considerations \nThe Figure 14 shows a suggested configuration to meet the \nconducted emission limits of EN55032 Class B. \n \nFigure14. EMC testing typical application circuit \n \n \n \nDigital Feature Descriptions  \nPMBus Interface Capability  \nThe module is equipped with a digital PMBus interface to \nallow the module to be configured, and communicate with system controllers. Detailed timing and electrical \ncharacteristics of the PMBus can be found in the PMB \nPower Management Protocol Specif ication, Part 1, revision \n1.2, available at http://pmbus.org. The module supports \nboth the 100kHz and 400kHz bus timing requirements. The \nmodule shall stretch the clock, as long as it does not exceed the maximum clock LO period of 35ms. The module will check the Packet Error Checking scheme (PEC) byte, if provided by the PMBus master, and include a PEC byte in \nall responses to the master. However, the module does not \nrequire a PEC byte from the PMBus master.  \n \nThe module supports a subset of the commands in the \nPMBus 1.2 specification. Most all of the controller parameters can be programmed using the PMBus and \nstored as defaults for later use. All commands that require \ndata input or output use the li near format. The exponent of \nthe data words is fixed at a reasonable value for the \ncommand and altering the exponent is not supported. Direct format data input or output is not supported by the module. \nThe supported commands are described in greater detail \nbelow.  \n \nThe module contains non-volatile memory that is used to \nstore configuration settings an d scale factors. The settings \nprogrammed into the device are not automatically saved \ninto this non-volatile memory though. The STORE_DEFAULT_ALL command must be used to commit \nthe current settings to non-volatile memory as device \ndefaults. The settings that are capable of being stored in \nnon-volatile memory are noted in their detailed descriptions.  \n \nSMBALERT Interface Capability  \nThe module also supports the SMBALERT response \nprotocol. The SMBALERT response protocol is a mechanism through which the module can alert the PMBus master that it has an active status or alarm condition via \npulling the SMBALERT pin to an active low. The master \nprocesses this condition, and simultaneously addresses all slaves on the PMBus through the Alert Response Address. \nOnly the slave(s) that caused the alert (and that support the \nprotocol) acknowledges this request. The master performs a modified receive byte operation to get the slave’s address. \nAt this point, the master can use the PMBus status \ncommands to query the slave that caused the alert.

Therefore, the factory default state for the \nmodule is to retain its resist or programmed address, when it \nis in an ALERT active condition, and not respond to the \nARA. This allows master systems, which do not support \nARA, to continue to communicate with the slave module using the programmed address, and using the various READ_STATUS commands to determine the cause for the SMBALERT. The CLEAR_FAULTS command will retire the \nactive SMBALERT. The module does not contain capability \nto arbitrate data bus contention caused by multiple modules responding to the modified received byte operation. \nTherefore, when the ARA is used in a multiple module \nPMBus application, it is necessary to have the module at the lowest programmed address in order for the host to \nproperly determine all modules’ address that are associated \nwith an active SMBAlert. Please contact your GE sales \nrepresentative for further assistance, and for more \ninformation on the SMBus alert response protocol, see the System Management Bus (SMBus) specification.\n \n \nPMBus Addressing  \nThe power module can be addressed through the PMBus \nusing a device address. The module has 64 possible \naddresses (0 to 63 in decimal) which can be set using \nresistors connected from the ADDR0 and ADDR1 pins to GND. Note that some of these addresses (0 through 12, 40, \n44, 45, and 55 in decimal) are reserved according to the \nSMBus specifications and may not be useable. The \naddress is set in the form of two octal (0 to 7) digits, with \neach pin setting one digit. The ADDR1 pin sets the high order digit and ADDR0 sets the low order digit. The resistor \nvalues suggested for each digit are shown in Table 4 (1% \ntolerance resistors are recommended).\n \nTable 1 \nDigit Resistor Value(K Ω) \n0 10 \n1 15.4 \n2 23.7 \n3 36.5 \n4 54.9 \n5 84.5 \n6 130 \n7 200 \n \nFigure 15. Circuit showing connection of resistors used \nto set the PMBus address of the module.  \n \nThe user must know which I 2C addresses are reserved in a \nsystem for special functions and set the address of the \nmodule to avoid interfering with other system operations. \nBoth 100kHz and 400kHz bus speeds are supported by the \nmodule. Connection for the PMBu s interface should follow \nthe High Power DC specifications given in section 3.1.3 in \nthe SMBus specification V2.0 for the 400kHz bus speed or \nthe Low Power DC specifications in section 3.1.2. The \ncomplete SMBus specification is available from the SMBus \nweb site, smbus.org.  \n \nPMBus Data Format  \nFor commands that set or report any voltage thresholds \nrelated to output voltage (including VOUT_COMMAND, \nVOUT_MARGIN, POWER_GOOD and READ_VOUT), the module supports the linear data  format consisting of a two \nbyte value with a 16-bit, unsigned mantissa, and a fixed \nexponent of -12. The format of the two data bytes is shown \nbelow: \n \nThe value of the number is then given by  \nValue = Mantissa x 2-12  \nFor commands that set all other thresholds, voltages or \nreport such quantities, the module supports the linear data \nformat consisting of a two byte value with an 11-bit, two’s complement mantissa and a 5-bit, two’s complement \nexponent. The format of the two data bytes is shown below: \n \n  \n D o c u m e n t  N o . S L N 1 A 9 6 . A                                   R e v .  1 . 0 0                               P a g e  1 5  o f  2 5  \n \nThe value is of the number is then given by  \nValue = Mantissa x 2Exponent \n \nPMBus-Enabled On/Off  \nThe module can also be turned on and off via the PMBus \ninterface. The OPERATION command is used to actually \nturn the module on and off via the PMBus, while the \nON_OFF_CONFIG command configures the combination of analog ON/OFF pin input and PMBus commands needed to \nturn the module on and off. Bit [7] in the OPERATION \ncommand data byte enables the module, with the following functions:  \n0: Output is disabled  \n1: Output is enabled  \nThis module uses the lower five bits of the \nON_OFF_CONFIG data byte to set various ON/OFF \noptions as follows: \nBit Position 4 3 2 1 0 \nAccess r r/w r r r \nFunction PU CMD CPR POL CPA \nDefault Value 1 1 1 1 1 \n \nPU: Factory set to 1. The modul e requires On/Off(i) pin to \nbe connected to proper input rail for module to power up. \nThis bit is used together with the CMD, CPR and ON bits to \ndetermine startup. \nBit Value Action \n1 Module does not power up until \ncommanded by the analog ON/OFF pin \nand the OPERATION command as \nprogrammed in bits [2:0] of the \nON_OFF_CONFIG register.  \nCMD: The CMD bit controls how the device responds to the \nOPERATION command. \nBit Value Action \n0 Module ignores the ON bit in the \nOPERATION command  \n1 Module responds to the ON bit in the \nOPERATION command  \n CPR: Factory set to 1. The module requires On/Off(i) pin to \nbe connected to proper input rail for module to power up. \nThis bit is used together with the CMD and ON bits to determine startup. \nBit Value Action \n1 Module requires the analog ON/OFF pin \nto be asserted to start the unit  \n \nAdjusting Input Undervoltage Lockout  \nThe module allows adjustment of the input under voltage \nlockout and hysteresis. The command VIN_ON allows \nsetting the input voltage turn on threshold, while the VIN_OFF command sets the input voltage turn off threshold. \nFor both the VIN_ON and VIN_OFF commands, possible \nvalues range from 32.000 to 46.000V in 0.125V steps. \nVIN_ON must be 2.000V greater than VIN_OFF.  \n \nAdjusting Output Voltage  \nThe module output voltage set point is adjusted using the VOUT_COMMAND. The output vo ltage setting uses the \nLinear data format, with the 16 bits of the \nVOUT_COMMAND formatted as an unsigned mantissa, \nand a fixed exponent of -12(decimal) (read from \nVOUT_MODE).  \nVOUT = Mantissa x 2\n-12  \nThe range limits for VOUT_COMMAND are 9.60V to \n13.20V, and the resolution is 0.244mV.  \nThe data associated with VOUT_COMMAND can be stored \nto non-volatile memory using the STORE_DEFAULT_ALL \ncommand. \n \nMeasuring Output Voltage  \nThe module can provide output voltage information using \nthe READ_VOUT command. The command returns two \nbytes of data in the linear format, with the 16 bits of the READ_VOUT formatted as an unsigned mantissa, and a fixed exponent of -12 (decimal).   During module manufacture, an offset correction value is \nwritten into the non-volatile memory of the module to null \nerrors in the tolerance and A/D conversion of VOUT.  \n \nMeasuring Input Voltage  \nThe module can provide input voltage information using the READ_VIN command. The command returns two bytes of \n \n  \n D o c u m e n t  N o . S L N 1 A 9 6 .

The upper  five bits [7:3] of the high \ndata byte form the two’s complement representation of the \nexponent, which is fixed at –3 (decimal). The remaining 11 bits are used for two’s complement representation of the \nmantissa, with the 11\nth bit fixed at zero since only positive \nnumbers are valid.   \nMeasuring Output Current  \nThe module measures output current by using a current \ntransformer as the current sense element. The module can \nprovide output current information using the READ_IOUT command. The command returns two bytes of data in the \nlinear format. The upper five bits [7:3] of the high data byte \nform the two’s complement representation of the exponent, \nwhich is fixed at –4 (decimal). The remaining 11 bits are \nused for two’s complement representation of the mantissa, with the 11\nth bit fixed at zero since only positive numbers \nare valid. Output current readings are blanked below 1.65A.  \n \nMeasuring Internal Module Temperature  \nThe module can provide temperature information using the \nREAD_TEMPERATURE_1 command. The command \nreturns two bytes of data in t he linear format. The upper five \nbits [7:3] of the high data by te form the two’s complement \nrepresentation of the exponent, which is fixed at –2 \n(decimal). The remaining 11 bits are used for two’s \ncomplement representation of the mantissa.  \n \nNote that the module’s temperature sensor is located close to the module hot spot TH\n1 (see Over Temperature \nProtection section).and is subjected to temperatures higher \nthan the ambient air temperature near the module. The temperature reading will be highly influenced by module \nload and airflow conditions.  \n \nReading Status of the Module  \nThe module supports a number of status information commands implemented in PMBus. However, not all \nfeatures are supported in these commands. A X in the \nFLAG cell indicates the bit is not supported.  \nSTATUS_WORD: Returns two bytes of information with a \nsummary of the module’s fault/warning conditions.\n \nHigh Byte \nBit Position Flag Default Value\n15 VOUT fault 0 \n14 IOUT fault or warning 0 13 Input Voltage fault 0 \n12 X 0 \n11 POWER_GOOD#(is \nnegated) 0 \n10 X 0 \n9 X 0 \n8 X 0 \nLow Byte \nBit Position Flag Default Value\n7 X 0 \n6 OFF 0 \n5 VOUT Overvoltage 0 \n4 IOUT Overcurrent 0 \n3 VIN Undervoltage 0 \n2 Temperature 0 \n1 CML(Comm, Memory Fault) 0 \n0 X 0 \n \nSTATUS_VOUT: Returns one byte of information relating to \nthe status of the module’s output voltage related faults. \nBit Position Flag Default Value\n7 VOUT OV Fault 0 \n6 X 0 \n5 X 0 \n4 X 0 \n3 X 0 \n2 X 0 \n1 X 0 \n0 X 0 \n \nSTATUS_IOUT: Returns one byte of information relating to \nthe status of the module’s ou tput current related faults. \nBit Position Flag Default Value\n7 IOUT OC Fault 0 \n6 X 0 \n5 IOUT OC Warning 0 \n4 X 0 \n3 X 0 \n2 X 0 \n1 X 0 \n0 X 0 \n \nSTATUS_INPUT: Returns one byte of information relating to \nthe status of the module’s input voltage related faults. \nBit Position Flag Default Value\n7 VIN OV Fault 0 \n6 X 0 \n5 X 0 \n4 VIN UV Fault 0 \n3 Module Off(Low VIN) 0 \n2 X 0 \n \n  \n D o c u m e n t  N o .
