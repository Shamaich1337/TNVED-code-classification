The typical optocoupler concerns regarding uncertain current transfer ratios, nonlinear transfer functions, and \ntemperature and lifetime effects are eliminated with the simple \niCoupler digital interfaces and stable performance characteristics. \nThe need for external drivers and other discrete components is eliminated with these iCoupler products. Furthermore, i Coupler \ndevices consume one-tenth to one-sixth of the power of \noptocouplers at comparable signal data rates. \nThe ADuM1300/ ADuM1301 isolators provide three independent \nisolation channels in a variety of channel configurations and \ndata rates (see the Ordering Guide). Both models operate with \nthe supply voltage on either side ranging from 2.7 V to 5.5 V , \nproviding compatibility with lower voltage systems as well as enabling a voltage translation functionality across the isolation barrier. In addition, the ADuM1300 /ADuM1301 provide low \npulse width distortion (<2 ns for CRW grade) and tight channel-\nto-channel matching (<2 ns for CRW grade). Unlike other \noptocoupler alternatives, the ADuM1300/ ADuM1301 isolators \nhave a patented refresh feature that ensures dc correctness in the absence of input logic transitions and when power is not applied to one of the supplies. \n \n1 Protected by U.S. Patents 5,952, 849; 6,873,065; 6,903,578; and 7,075,329. \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAMS \n \nFigure 1.

Output supply current val ues are specified with no output load \npresent. The supply current associated with an individual channe l operating at a given data rate may be calculated as described in the Power Consumption  section. \nSee Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on per -channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through \nFigure 12 for to tal V DD1 and V DD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM1300/ ADuM1301 channel configurations.  \n2 The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n3 The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n4 tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ox signal. t PLH propagation delay is \nmeasured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of t he rising edge of the V Ox signal.  \n5 tPSK is the magnitude of the worst- case difference in t PHL or t PLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load \nwithin the recommended operating conditions.  \n6 Codirec tional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the sa me side of \nthe isolation barrier. Opposing -directional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with \ninputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.  \n7 CM H is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining V O > 0.8 V DD2. CM L is the maximum common -mode voltag e slew rate \nthat can be sustained while maintaining V O < 0.8 V. The common -mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common -mode voltage edges. The transient \nmagnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.  \n8 Dynamic supply curre nt is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information \non per -channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions.

Output supply current values are specified with no output load present. The \nsupply current associated with an individual channel operating at  a given data rate may be calculated as described in the Power Consumption  section. See Figure 6 through \nFigure 8 for information on per -channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through Figure 12 for total VDD1 and VDD2 \nsupply currents as a  function of data rate for ADuM1300W /ADuM1301W  channel configurations.  \n2 The minimum pulse width  is the shortest pulse width  at which the specified pulse widt h distortion is guaranteed.  \n3 The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width  distortion is guaranteed.  \n4 tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ox signal. t PLH propagation delay is measured \nfrom the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ox signal.  \n5 tPSK is the magnitude of the worst- case diff erence in t PHL or t PLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load within the \nrecommended operating conditions.  \n6 Codirectional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in pr opagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation \nbarrier. Opposing -directional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on opposi ng \nsides of the isolation barrier.  \n7 CM H is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining V O > 0.8  VDD2. CM L is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate tha t can be \nsustained while maintaining V O < 0.8 V. The common -mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common -mode voltage edges. The transient magnitude is the \nrange over which the common mode is slewed.  \n8 Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in  signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on  \nper-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions.

K | Page 25 of 32 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nPRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD (PCB) LAYOUT \nThe ADuM1300 /ADuM1301 digital isolator requires no external \ninterface circuitry for the logic interfaces. Power supply bypassing is \nstrongly recommended at the input and output supply pins (see Figure 14). Bypass capacitors are most conveniently connected \nbetween Pin 1 and Pin 2 for V\nDD1 and between Pin 15 and Pin 16 \nfor V DD2. The capacitor value should be between 0.01 μF and 0.1 μF. \nThe total lead length between both ends of the capacitor and \nthe input power supply pin should not exceed 20 mm. Bypassing between Pin 1 and Pin 8 and between Pin 9 and Pin 16 should also be considered unless the ground pair on each package side is connected close to the package. \n \nFigure 14. Recommended Printed Circuit Board Layout  \nIn applications involving high common-mode transients,  take care to ensure that board coupling across the isolation barrier is minimized. Furthermore, the board layout should be designed such that any coupling that does occur equally affects all pins on a given component side. Failure to ensure this could \ncause voltage differentials between pins exceeding the absolute \nmaximum ratings of the device, thereby leading to latch-up or \npermanent damage. \nSee the AN-1109 Application Note  for board layout guidelines. \nPROPAGATION DELAY-RELATED PARAMETERS \nPropagation delay is a parameter that describes the time it takes \na logic signal to propagate through a component. The propagation \ndelay to a logic low output may differ from the propagation \ndelay to a logic high output. \n \nFigure 15. Propagation Delay Parameters \nPulse width distortion is the maximum difference between \nthese two propagation delay values and is an indication of  \nhow accurately the timing of the input signal is preserved.  \nChannel-to-channel matching refers to the maximum amount \nthat the propagation delay differs between channels within a \nsingle ADuM1300 /ADuM1301 component.  \nPropagation delay skew refers to the maximum amount that the \npropagation delay differs between multiple ADuM1300 / \nADuM1301 components operating under the same conditions. \n DC CORRECTNESS AND MAGNETIC FIELD IMMUNITY \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input cause \nnarrow (approximately 1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via \nthe transformer. The decoder is bistable and is therefore either set or reset by the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In \nthe absence of logic transitions at the input for more than \napproximately 1 μs, a periodic set of refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state are sent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal pulses for more than about 5 μs, the input side is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctional, in which case the isolator output is forced to a default state (see Table 15) by the watchdog timer circuit. \nThe ADuM1300/ ADuM1301 is extremely immune to external \nmagnetic fields. The limitation on the magnetic field immunity \nof the ADuM1300 /ADuM1301 is set by the condition in which \ninduced voltage in the receiving coil of the transformer is sufficiently large enough to either falsely set or reset the decoder. The following analysis defines the conditions under which this \nmay occur. The 3 V operating condition of the ADuM1300/ \nADuM1301 is examined because it represents the most \nsusceptible mode of operation. \nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater \nthan 1.0 V . The decoder has a sensing threshold at about 0.5 V , thus establishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can be \ntolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is given by \nV = (−dβ/dt )∑∏r\nn2; n = 1, 2, … , N \nwhere: \nβ is magnetic flux density (gauss).  \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil. \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm). \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM1300/ \nADuM1301 and an imposed requirement that the induced \nvoltage be 50% at most of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable magnetic field is calculated as shown in Figure 16. \n \nFigure 16.

K | Page 26 of 32 For example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This  is about 50% of the \nsensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. \nSimilarly, if such an event occur s during a transmitted pulse \n(and has the worst -case polarity), it reduce s the received pulse \nfrom >1.0  V to 0.75  V—still well above the 0.5 V sensing \nthreshold of the decoder.  \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to \nspecific current magnitudes at given distances from the ADuM1300/ ADuM1301 transformers. Figure 17 shows  these \nallowable current magnitudes as a function of frequency for selected distances. The ADuM1300/ ADuM1301 is extremely \nimmune and can be affected only by extremely large currents operated at a high frequency very close to the component. For \nthe 1 MHz example noted, one would have to pl ace a 0.5 kA \ncurrent 5 mm away from the ADuM1300/ ADuM1301 to affect \nthe operation  of the component . \n \nFigure 17. Maximum Allowable Current  \nfor Various Current -to-ADuM1300 /ADuM1301  Spacings  \nNote that at combinati ons of strong magnetic field and high \nfrequency, any loops formed by printed circuit board traces could induce error voltages sufficiently large enough to trigger \nthe thresholds of succeeding circuitry. Take care  in the layout of \nsuch traces to avoid this possibility.  POWER CONSUMPTION  \nThe supply current at a given channel of the ADuM1300/ ADuM1301 isolator is a function of the supply voltage, the data \nrate of the channel , and the output load  of the channel . \nFor each input channel, the supply current is given by  \nI\nDDI = I DDI (Q) f ≤ 0.5 f r \nIDDI = I DDI (D) × (2f − f r) + I DDI (Q)  f > 0.5 f r \nFor each ou tput channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDO = I DDO (Q) f ≤ 0.5 f r \nIDDO = (IDDO (D) + (0.5 × 10−3) × CL × V DDO) × (2 f − f r) + I DDO (Q) \n f > 0.5 f r \nwhere:  \nIDDI (D), IDDO (D) are the input and output dynamic supply currents \nper channel (mA/Mbps).  \nCL is the output load capacitance (pF).  \nVDDO is the output supply voltage (V).  \nf is the input logic signal frequency (MHz); it is half of the input \ndata rate expressed in units of Mbps.  \nfr is the input stage refresh rate (Mbps).  \nIDDI (Q), IDDO (Q) are the specified input and output quiescent \nsupply currents (mA).  \nTo calculate the total V DD1 and V DD2 supply current, the supply \ncurrents for each input and output channel corresponding to \nVDD1 and V DD2 are calculated and totaled. Figure 6 and Figure 7 \nprovide per -channel supply currents as a function of data rate \nfor an unloaded  output condition. Figure 8 provides per -channel  \nsupply current as a function of data rate for a 15  pF output \ncondition. Figure 9 through Figure 12 provide total V DD1 and \nVDD2 supply current as a function of data rate for ADuM1300/  \nADuM1301 channel configurations.

K | Page 27 of 32 INSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when sub jected to \nvoltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of insulation  \ndegradation is depende nt on the characteristics of the voltage \nwaveform applied across the insulation. In addition to the \ntesting performed by the regulatory agencies, Analog Devices \ncarries out an extensive set of evaluations to determine the lifetime of the insulation structure within the ADuM1300/ \nADuM1301.  \nAnalog Devices performs accelerated life testing using voltage levels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. Accel -\neration factors for several operating conditions are determined. These factors allow calculation of th e time to  failure at the actual \nworking voltage. The values shown in Table 14 summarize  the \npeak voltage for 50 years of service life for a bipolar ac operating \ncondition and the maximum CSA/VDE approved working voltages. In many cases, the approved working voltage is higher \nthan the 50-year service life voltage. Operation at these high \nworking voltages can lead to shortened insulation life in some \ncases.  \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADuM1300/ ADuM1301 depends \non the voltage waveform type imposed across the isolation barrier. \nThe iCoupler insulation structure degrades at different rates \ndepending on whether the waveform is bipolar ac,  unipolar ac, \nor dc. Figure 18, Figure  19, and Figure 20 illustrate these differen t \nisolation voltage waveforms , respectively . \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. The goal of a 5 0-year operating lifetime under the ac bipolar condition \ndetermines the Analog Devices recommended maximum \nworking voltage.  \n \n  In the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the \ninsulation is significantly lower , which allows operation at \nhigher w orking voltages while still achieving a 50 -year service \nlife. The working voltages listed in Table 14 can be applied while \nmaintaining the 50 -year minimum lifetime provided the voltage \nconforms to either the unipolar ac or dc voltage cases. Any cross  \ninsulation voltage waveform that does not conform to Figure  19 \nor Figure 20 should be treated as a bipolar ac waveform , and its \npeak volt age should be limited to the 5 0-year lifetime voltage \nvalue listed in Table 14. \nNote that the voltage presented in Figure  19 is shown as sinusoidal \nfor illustration purposes only. It is meant to represent any voltage  \nwaveform varying between 0 V and some limiti ng value. The \nlimiting value can be positive or negativ e, but the voltage  \ncannot cross 0 V .  \n \nFigure 18. Bipolar AC Waveform \n \n \nFigure  19. Unipolar AC Waveform  \n \n \nFigure 20.
