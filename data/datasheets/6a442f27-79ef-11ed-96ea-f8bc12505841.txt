The device supplies 200mA of output current \nwith a typical dropout voltage of 300mV. A single external capacitor provides programmable low noise reference performance and output soft-start functionality. The LT3062’s quiescent current is merely 45μA and provides fast transient response with a minimum 3.3μF output capacitor . In shutdown, quiescent current is less than 1μA \nand the reference soft start capacitor is reset.\nThe LT3062 optimizes stability and transient response \nwith low ESR, ceramic output capacitors. The LT3062 does not require the addition of ESR as is common with other regulators.\nInternal protection circuitry includes reverse-battery pro -\ntection, reverse-output protection, reverse-current protec -\ntion, current limit with foldback and thermal shutdown.The LT3062  is available in fixed output voltages of \n3.3V \nand 5V, and as an adjustable device with an output voltage \nrange from the 600mV reference up to 40V. The LT3062 is offered in the thermally enhanced 8-lead 2mm × 3mm \nDFN and MSOP packages.\n3.3V Low Noise RegulatorDropout Voltageapplica Tionsn Input Voltage Range: 1.6V to 45V\nn Output Current: 200mA\nn Quiescent Current: 45µA\nn Dropout Voltage: 300mV\nn Low Noise: 30µV RMS (10Hz to 100kHz)\nn Adjustable Output (V REF = 600mV)\n nFixed Output Voltages: 3.3V, 5V\nn Output Tolerance: ±2% Over Load, Line, and Temperature\nn Single Capacitor Soft-Starts Reference and Lowers Output Noise\nn Shutdown Current: < 1µA\nn Reverse Battery Protection\nn Current Limit Foldback and Thermal Limit Protection\nn 8-Lead 2mm × 3mm DFN and MSOP Packages\nn Battery Powered Systems\nn Automotive Power Supplies\nn Industrial Power Supplies\nn Avionic Power Supplies\nn Portable Instruments\nL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks and \nThinSOT is a trademark of Linear Technology Corporation.

(Note 3)elecTrical charac TerisTics\nNote 1: Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings \nmay cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: Absolute maximum input to output differential voltage is not \nachievable with all combinations of rated IN pin and OUT pin voltages. With the IN pin at 50V, the OUT pin may not be pulled below 0V. The total measured voltage from IN to OUT must not exceed ±50V. If OUT is above ground, do not pull IN more than 40V below OUT .\nNote 3: The LT3062 is tested and specified under pulse load conditions \nsuch that T\nJ ≅ T A. The LT3062E regulators are 100% tested at T A = 25°C \nand performance is guaranteed from 0°C to 125°C. Performance at –40°C to 125°C is assured by design, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls. The LT3062I regulators are guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. The LT3062MP regulators are 100% tested over the –55°C to 150°C operating junction temperature. The LT3062H regulators are 100% tested at the 150°C operating junction temperature. High junction temperatures degrade operating lifetimes. Operating lifetime is derated at junction temperature greater than 125°C.\nNote 4: The LT3062 adjustable version is tested and specified for these \nconditions with the ADJ connected to the OUT pin.\nNote 5: Maximum junction temperature limits operating conditions. The \nregulated output voltage specification does not apply for all possible combinations of input voltage and output current. Limit the output current range if operating at the maximum input voltage. Limit the input-to-output voltage differential if operating at maximum output current. Current limit foldback limits the maximum output current as a function of input-to-output voltage. See Current Limit vs V\nIN – V OUT in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section.Note 6: To satisfy minimum input voltage requirements, the LT3062 adjustable version is tested and specified for these conditions with an external resistor divider (bottom 60k, top 230k) for an output voltage of 2.9V. The external resistor divider adds 10µA of DC load on the output. The external current is not factored into GND pin current.\nNote 7: Dropout voltage is the minimum input-to-output voltage \ndifferential needed to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In dropout, the output voltage equals: (V\nIN – V DROPOUT ).\nNote 8: GND pin current is tested with V IN = V OUT(NOMINAL)  + 0.6V and a \ncurrent source load. GND pin current will increase in dropout. See GND pin current curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section. For fixed voltage options, an internal resistor divider will add 5μA to the GND pin current. See the GND Pin Current curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nNote 9: ADJ pin bias current flows out of the ADJ pin.Note 10: SHDN pin current flows into the SHDN pin.Note 11: To satisfy requirements for minimum input voltage, current limit \nis tested at V\nIN = V OUT(NOMINAL)  + 1V or V IN = 2.1V, whichever is greater .\nNote 12: This IC includes thermal limit which protects the device during momentary overload conditions.  Junction temperature exceeds 125°C (E-Grade and I-Grade) or 150°C (MP-Grade and H-Grade) when thermal limit is active. Continuous operation above the specified maximum junction temperature may impair device reliability.\nNote 13: Reverse output current is tested with the IN pin grounded and the \nOUT pin forced to the specified voltage. This current flows into the OUT pin and out of the GND pin.PARAMETER CONDITIONS MIN TYP MAX UNITS\nADJ Pin Bias Current (Notes 4, 9) l 15 60 nA\nShutdown Threshold VOUT = Off to On \nVOUT = On to Offl

Connecting a single \ncapacitor from this pin to GND bypasses the LT3062’s reference noise and soft-starts the reference. A 10nF by -\npass capacitor typically reduces output voltage noise to 30μV\nRMS in a 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth. Soft-start time \nis directly proportional to the REF/BYP capacitor value.  If the LT3062 is placed in shutdown, REF/BYP is actively pulled low by an internal device to reset soft-start. If low noise or soft-start performance is not required, this pin must be left floating (unconnected). Do not drive this pin with any active circuitry.\nADJ (Pin 2): Adjust. This pin is the error amplifier’s invert -\ning terminal. Its typical bias current of 15nA flows out of \nthe pin (see cur ve of ADJ Pin Bias Current vs T\nemperature \nin the Typical performance Characteristics section). The ADJ pin voltage is 600mV referenced to GND.\nOUT (Pins 3, 4): Output. These pins supply power to the \nload. A minimum output capacitor of 3.3µF is required to prevent oscillations. Large load transient applications require larger output capacitors to limit peak voltage transients. See the Applications Information section for more information on transient response and reverse output characteristics. The output voltage range is 600mV to 40V. \nIN (Pins 5, 6): Input. These pins supply power to the \ndevice. The LT3062 requires a bypass capacitor at IN if the device is located more than six inches from the main input filter capacitor . In general, the output impedance of a battery rises with frequency, so it is advisable to include a bypass capacitor in battery-powered circuits. A bypass capacitor in the range of 1µF to 10µF suffices. See Input Capacitance and Stability in the Application Information section for more information.The LT3062 withstands reverse voltages on the IN pin with respect to the GND and OUT pins. In a reversed input situation, such as the battery plugged in backwards, the LT3062 behaves as if a large value resistor is in series with its input. Limited reverse current flows into the LT3062 and no reverse voltage appears at the load. The device protects itself and the load.\nSHDN (Pin 7): Shutdown. Pulling the SHDN pin low puts \nthe LT3062 into a low power state and turns the output off. Drive the SHDN pin with either logic or an open collec -\ntor/drain with a pull-up resistor . The resistor supplies the pull-up current to the open collector/drain logic, normally several microamperes, and the SHDN\n pin current, typi -\ncally less than 3µA. If unused, connect the SHDN pin to V\nIN. The LT3062 does not function if the SHDN pin is not \nconnected. The SHDN pin cannot be driven below GND unless tied to the IN pin. If the SHDN pin is driven below GND while IN is powered, the output will turn on. SHDN pin logic cannot be referenced to a negative rail.  \nGND (Pin 8, Exposed Pad Pin 9): Ground. Connect the \nbottom of the external resistor divider that sets the output voltage directly to GND for optimum regulation. Tie the exposed pad Pin 9 directly to Pin 8 and the PCB ground.  This exposed pad provides enhanced thermal performance with its connection to the PCB ground. See the Applica -\ntions Information section for thermal considerations and calculating junction temperature.\nLT3062 Series11\n3062fa For more information www.linear .com/L T3062The LT3062 is a 200mA low dropout regulator with \nshutdown that is available in fixed output and adjustable \nversions.  The device is capable of supplying 200mA at a typical dropout voltage of 300mV and operates over a 1.6V to 45V input range.\nA single external capacitor provides programmable low \nnoise reference performance and output soft-start func -\ntionality. For example, connecting a 10nF capacitor from the REF/BYP pin to GND lowers output noise to 30µV\nRMS \nover a 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth. This capacitor also \nsoft-starts the reference and prevents output voltage overshoot at turn-on.\nThe LT3062’s quiescent current is merely 45μA, while \nproviding fast transient response with a 3.3μF minimum low ESR ceramic output capacitor . In shutdown, quies -\ncent current is less than 1μA and the reference soft-start capacitor and output are reset.\nThe LT3062  optimizes stability and transient response \nwith low ESR, ceramic output capacitors. The \nLT3062 \ndoes not require the addition of ESR as is common with \nother regulators. The LT3062 has an adjustable output and typically provides 0.1% line regulation and 0.1% load regulation. A curve of load regulation appears in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nInternal protection circuitry includes reverse-battery \nprotection, reverse-current protection, current limit with foldback and thermal shutdown.\nAdjustable Operation\nThe adjustable LT3062 has an output voltage range of 0.6V \nto 40V. Output voltage is set by the ratio of two external \nresistors, as shown in Figure 1. The device regulates the output to maintain the ADJ pin voltage at 0.6V referenced \nto ground. The current in R1 equals 0.6V/R1, and R2’s current is R1’s current minus the ADJ pin bias current.\nThe ADJ pin bias current, 15nA at 25°C, flows from the \nADJ pin through R1 to GND. Calculate the output voltage using the formula in Figure 1. R1’s value should not be greater than 124k to provide a minimum ~5μA load cur -applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 1. Adjustable Operationrent so that output voltage errors, caused by the ADJ pin bias current, are minimized. Note that in shutdown, the output is turned off and the divider current is zero.

A good quality low leak -\nage capacitor is recommended. This capacitor bypasses the reference of the regulator , providing a low frequency \nnoise \npole for the internal reference. With the use of 10nF \nfor C REF/BYP , the output voltage noise decreases to as \nlow as 30µV RMS when the output voltage is set for 0.6V.  \nFor higher output voltages (generated by using a resistor divider), the output voltage noise gains up accordingly when using C\nREF/BYP  by itself.\nTo lower the output voltage noise for higher output volt -\nages, include a feedforward capacitor (C FF) from V OUT \nto the ADJ pin. A good quality, low leakage capacitor is recommended. This capacitor bypasses the error amplifier of the regulator , providing a low frequency noise pole. With the use of 10nF for both C\nFF and C REF/BYP , output voltage \nnoise decreases to 30µV RMS when the output voltage is \nset to 5V by a 5µA feedback resistor divider . If the current in the feedback resistor divider is doubled, C\nFF must also \nbe doubled to achieve equivalent noise performance.\nHigher values of output voltage noise may be measured \nif care is not exercised with regard to circuit layout and testing. Crosstalk from nearby traces can induce unwanted noise onto the LT3062’s output. Power supply ripple rejec -\ntion must also be considered. The LT3062 regulator does not have unlimited power supply rejection and will pass a small portion of the input noise through to the output.\nUsing a feedforward capacitor (C\nFF) from V OUT to the ADJ \npin has the added benefit of improving transient response \nfor output voltages greater than 0.6V. With no feedforward capacitor , the settling time will increase as the output voltage is raised above 0.6V. Use the equation in Figure 2  \nto determine the minimum value of C\nFF to achieve a \ntransient response that is similar to 0.6V output voltage performance regardless of the chosen output voltage (see Figure 3 and T ransient Response in the Typical Performance Characteristics section).\nFeedforward capacitance can also be used in fixed-voltage \nparts; the feedforward capacitor is connected from OUT to ADJ in the same manner . In this case, the current in the internal feedback resistor divider is 5μA.\n3062 F02IN\nSHDNOUT\nADJ\nGND REF/BYPL T3062 VINVOUT\nCREF/BYPCFF COUT R2\nR1\nC4.7nF\n5µAI\nIV\nR1R2FF FB–DIVIDER\nFB–DIVIDEROUT()≥•\n=+\n100µs/DIVVOUT = 5V\nCOUT = 10µF\nIFB-DIVIDER  = 5µA0\n1nF\n10nF\nLOAD CURRENT\n200mA/DIVFEEDFORWARD\nCAPACITOR, C FF\n10pF\n3062 F03VOUT\n100mV/DIV\nFigure 2.

Regulator startup time \nis directly proportional to the size of the bypass capacitor , \nslowing to \n6ms with a 10nF bypass capacitor (See SHDN \nTransient Response vs REF/BYP Capacitor in the Typical Performance Characteristics section). The reference by -\npass capacitor is actively pulled low during shutdown to reset the internal reference.\nStart-up time is also affected by the use of a feedfor ward \ncapacitor\n. Start-up time is directly proportional to the size \nof the feedforward capacitor and output voltage, and is \ninversely proportional to the feedback resistor divider cur -\nrent, slowing to 15ms with a 4.7nF feedforward capacitor and a 10µF\n output capacitor for an output voltage set to \n5V by a 5µA feedback resistor divider .\nOutput Capacitance\nThe LT3062 regulator is stable with a wide range of output \ncapacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor affects stability, most notably with small capacitors. Use a minimum output capacitor of 3.3µF with an ESR of 3Ω or less to prevent oscillations. If a feedforward capacitor is used with output voltages set for greater than 24V, use a minimum output capacitor of 10µF. The LT3062 is a micropower device and output load transient response is a function of output capacitance. Larger values of output capacitance decrease the peak deviations and provide improved transient re -\nsponse for larger load current changes. Bypass capacitors, used to decouple individual components powered by the LT3062 , will increase the effective output capacitor value. \n \nFor applications with large load current transients, a low ESR ceramic capacitor in parallel with a bulk tantalum capacitor often provides an optimally damped response.applica Tions inForMaTion\nGive extra consideration to the use of ceramic capacitors. Manufacturers make ceramic capacitors with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across tempera -\nture and applied voltage. The most common dielectrics are specified with EIA temperature characteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V , X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics provide high C-V products in a small package at low cost, but exhibit strong voltage and temperature coefficients as shown in Figures 4 and 5. When used with a \n5V regulator , \na 16V 10µF Y5V capacitor can exhibit an effective value \nas low as 1µF to 2µF for the DC bias voltage applied and over the operating temperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics yield much more stable characteristics and are more suitable for use as the output capacitor . The X7R type works over a wider temperature range and has better temperature stability, while the X5R is less expensive and is available in higher values. Care still must be exercised when using X5R and X7R capacitors; the X5R and X7R codes only specify operating temperature range and maximum capacitance change over temperature. Capacitance change due to DC bias with X5R and X7R capacitors is better than Y5V and Z5U capacitors, but can still be significant enough to drop capacitor values below appropriate levels. Capaci -\ntor DC bias characteristics tend to improve as component case size increases, but expected capacitance at operating voltage should be verified.\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsour\nces of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, similar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or micro -\nphone works. For a ceramic capacitor , the stress can be induced by \nvibrations in the system or thermal transients. \nLT3062 Series14\n3062fa For more information www.linear .com/L T3062applica Tions inForMaTion\nDC BIAS VOLTAGE (V)CHANGE IN VALUE (%)\n3062 F0420\n0\n–20\n–40–60–80\n–100\n0 4 8 10 2 6 12 14X5R\nY5V\n16BOTH CAPACITORS ARE 16V,\n1210 CASE SIZE, 10µF  \nTEMPERATURE (°C)–5040\n20\n0\n–20–40–60–80\n–100\n25 75\n3062 F05–25 0 50 100 125Y5VCHANGE IN VALUE (%)X5R\nBOTH CAPACITORS ARE 16V,\n1210 CASE SIZE, 10µF  Figure 4.

Noise Resulting from Tapping on a Ceramic CapacitorThe resulting voltages produced can cause appreciable \namounts of noise. A ceramic capacitor produced the trace in Figure 6 in response to light tapping from a pencil. Similar vibration induced behavior can masquerade as increased output voltage noise.\nInput Capacitance and Stability\nLow ESR, ceramic input bypass capacitors are acceptable \nfor applications without long input leads. However , applica -\ntions connecting a power supply to an LT3062 circuit’s IN and GND \npins with long input wires combined with a \nlow ESR, ceramic input capacitor are prone to voltage spikes, reliability concerns and application-speciﬁc board oscillations. \nThe input wire inductance found in many battery-powered \napplications, combined with the low ESR ceramic input capacitor , forms a high Q LC resonant tank circuit. In some instances this resonant frequency beats against the output current dependent LDO bandwidth and interferes with proper operation. Simple circuit modifications/solu -\ntions are then required. This behavior is not indicative of LT3062  instability\n, but is a common ceramic input bypass \ncapacitor application issue.\nThe self-inductance, or isolated inductance, of a wire is \ndirectly proportional to its length. Wire diameter is not a major factor on its self-inductance. For example, the self-inductance of a 2-AWG isolated wire (diameter = 0.26") is about half the self-inductance of a 30-AWG wire (diameter \n= 0.01"). One foot of 30-AWG wire has approximately 465nH of self-inductance.\n4ms/DIV3062 F06VOUT\n500µV/DIVVOUT = 0.6V\nCOUT = 10µF\nCREF/BYP  = 10nF\nILOAD  = 100mA\nLT3062 Series15\n3062fa For more information www.linear .com/L T3062T wo methods can reduce wire self-inductance. One method \ndivides the current flowing towards the LT3062 between two parallel conductors. In this case, the farther apart the wires are from each other , the more the self-inductance is reduced; up to a 50% reduction when placed a few inches apart. Splitting the wires connects two equal inductors in parallel, but placing them in close proximity creates mutual inductance adding to the self-inductance. The second and most effective way to reduce overall inductance is to place both forward and return current conductors (the input and GND wires) in very close proximity. T wo 30-AWG \nwires separated by only 0.02”, used as forward and return current conductors, reduce the overall self-inductance to approximately one-ﬁfth that of a single isolated wire.\nIf a battery, mounted in close proximity, powers the LT3062, \na 1µF input capacitor suffices for stability. However , if a distant supply powers the LT3062, use a larger value input capacitor . Use a rough guideline of 1µF (in addition to the 1µF minimum) per 8 inches of wire length. The minimum input capacitance needed to stabilize the application also varies with power supply output impedance variations. Placing additional capacitance on the LT3062’s output also helps. However , this requires an order of magnitude more capacitance in comparison with additional LT3062 input bypassing. Series resistance between the supply and the LT3062 input also helps stabilize the applica -\ntion; as little as 0.1Ω to 0.5Ω suffices. This impedance dampens the LC tank cir cuit at the expense of dropout \nvoltage. A better alternative is to use higher ESR tantalum or electrolytic capacitors at the \nLT3062 input in place of \nceramic capacitors.applica Tions inForMaTion\nOverload Recovery\nLike many IC power regulators, the LT3062 has safe oper -\nating area protection. The safe area protection decreases \ncurrent limit as input-to-output voltage increases and keeps  \nthe power transistor inside a safe operating region for all values of input-to-output voltage. The protective design provides some output current at all values of input-to-output voltage up to the device breakdown.\nWhen power is first applied, as input voltage rises, the \noutput follows the input, allowing the regulator to start up into \nvery heavy loads. During start-up, as the input voltage \nis rising, the input-to-output voltage differential is small, allowing the regulator to supply large output currents. With a high input voltage, a problem can occur wherein removal of an output short will not allow the output to recover . \nThe problem occurs with a heavy output load when the \ninput voltage is high and the output voltage is low. Com -\nmon situations include immediately after the removal of a short-circuit or if the shutdown pin is pulled high after the input voltage has already been turned on. The load line for such a load may intersect the output current cur\nve at two \npoints. If this happens, there are two stable output operat -\ning points for the regulator . With this double intersection, the input power supply may need to be cycled down to zero and brought up again to make the output recover .\nLT3062 Series16\n3062fa For more information www.linear .com/L T3062applica Tions inForMaTion\nThermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device will be limited \nby the maximum rated junction temperature (125°C for LT3062E, LT3062I or 150°C  for LT3062MP , LT3062H). T wo \ncomponents comprise the power dissipated by the device:\n1.\n Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage \ndifferential: I OUT • (V IN – VOUT), and\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage:  I\nGND • VIN\nGND pin current is determined using the GND Pin Current curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section. Power dissipation will be equal to the sum of the two components listed above.\nThe LT3062 regulator has internal thermal limiting that pro -\ntects the device during overload conditions. For continuous \nnormal conditions, the maximum junction temperature of 125°C\n (E-grade, I-grade) or 150°C (MP-grade, H-grade) \nmust not be exceeded. Carefully consider all sources of thermal resistance from junction to ambient including other heat sources mounted in proximity to the LT3062.\nThe undersides of the LT3062 packages have exposed metal \nfrom the lead frame to the die attachment. The package allows heat to directly transfer from the die junction to the printed circuit board metal to control maximum operating junction temperature. The dual-in-line pin arrangement allows metal to extend beyond the ends of the package on the topside (component side) of a PCB. Connect this metal to GND on the PCB. The multiple IN and OUT pins of the LT3062 also assist in spreading heat to the PCB.\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board and its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated through-holes can also be used to spread the heat gener -\nated by power devices.Table 2.

All measurements were taken in still air on a 4 layer FR-4 board with 1oz solid internal planes and 2oz top/bottom external trace planes with a total board thickness of 1.6mm. The four layers were electrically isolated with no thermal vias present. PCB layers, copper weight, board layout and thermal vias will affect the resultant thermal resistance. For more information on thermal resistance and high thermal conductivity test boards, refer to JEDEC standard JESD51, notably JESD51-12 and JESD51-7. Achieving low thermal resistance necessitates attention to detail and careful PCB layout. \nLT3062 Series17\n3062fa For more information www.linear .com/L T3062Calculating Junction Temperature\nExample: Given an output voltage of 2.5V, an input volt -\nage range of 12V ± 5%, an output current range of 0mA \nto 50mA and a maximum ambient temperature of 85°C, \nwhat will the maximum junction temperature be?\nThe power dissipated by the device equals:\n IOUT(MAX)  • (V IN(MAX) –VOUT) + I GND • VIN(MAX)\nwhere,\n IOUT(MAX)  = 50mA\n VIN(MAX)  = 12.6V\n IGND at (I OUT = 50mA, V IN = 12V) = 1mA\nSo,\n P = 50mA \n• (12.6V – 2.5V) + 1mA • 12.6V = 0.518W\nUsing a DFN package, the thermal resistance will be in \nthe range of 38°C/W to 45°C/W depending on the copper area. So the junction temperature rise above ambient will be approximately equal to:\n 0.518W \n• 45°C/W = 23.3°C\nThe maximum junction temperature equals the maximum ambient temperature plus the maximum junction tempera -\nture rise above ambient or:\n TJMAX = 85°C + 23.3°C = 108.3°Capplica Tions inForMaTion\nProtection Features\nThe LT3062 incorporates several protection features that \nmake it ideal for use in battery-powered circuits. In ad -\ndition to the normal protection features associated with monolithic regulators, such as current limiting and thermal limiting, the device also protects against reverse-input voltages, reverse-output voltages and reverse output-to-input voltages.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nprotect \nthe device against current overload conditions at \nthe output of the device. The typical thermal limit tem -\nperature is 165°C. For normal operation, do not exceed a junction temperature of 125°C \n (LT3062E, LT3062I) or \n150°C (LT3062MP , LT3062H).\nThe LT3062 IN pin withstands reverse voltages of 50V. The \ndevice limits current flow to less than 1mA (typically less than 250µA) and no negative voltage appears at OUT . The device protects both itself and the load against batteries that are plugged in backwards.\nThe SHDN pin cannot be driven below GND unless tied to \nthe IN pin. If the SHDN pin is driven below GND while IN \nis powered, the output will turn on. SHDN pin logic cannot be referenced to a negative rail.\nThe LT3062 incurs no damage if its output is pulled be -\nlow ground. If the input is left open-circuit or grounded, \nthe output can be pulled below ground by 50V\n. No cur -\nrent flows through the pass transistor from the output. However , current flows in (but is limited by) the resistor \ndivider that sets the output voltage. Current flows from the bottom resistor in the divider and from the ADJ pin\n’s \ninternal clamp through the top resistor in the divider to the external circuitry pulling OUT below ground. If the input is powered by a voltage source, the output sources current equal to its current limit capability and the LT3062 protects itself by thermal limiting. In this case, grounding the SHDN pin turns off the device and stops the output \nfrom sourcing current.\nLT3062 Series18\n3062fa For more information www.linear .com/L T3062applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 7. Reverse Output CurrentThe LT3062 incurs no damage if the ADJ pin is pulled \nabove or below ground by 50V. If the input is left open circuit or grounded, the ADJ pin performs like a large resistor (typically 30k) in series with a diode when pulled above or below ground.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several \ndifferent input/output conditions can occur . The output voltage may be held up temporarily or otherwise while the input is pulled to ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage or left open-circuit. Current flow back into the OUT and ADJ pins follows the curve shown in Figure 7. If the LT3062\'s IN pin is forced below the OUT pin or the OUT pin is pulled above the IN pin, regardless of the state of the SHDN pin, input current typically drops to less than 1µA.\nOUTPUT VOL TAGE (V)00REVERSE OUTPUT CURRENT (mA)1.8\n0.60.81.01.21.41.6\n0.20.42.0\n5 25 30 35 40 45 10 153062 F0720VIN = 0V\nVADJ = VOUT\nADJ\nOUT\nLT3062 Series19\n3062fa For more information www.linear .com/L T3062package Descrip Tion\nPlease refer to http://www.linear .com/product/LT3062#packaging for the most recent package drawings.\n3.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)2.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
