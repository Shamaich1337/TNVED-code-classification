#### Key Specifications:
- **Model**: M Plan Apo SL 20X
- **Working Distance**: 30.5 mm (in air)
- **Corrected Wavelength**: 436-656 nm
- **Numerical Aperture (N.A.)**: 0.28
- **Focal Distance (f)**: 10 mm
- **Parfocal Distance (P.D.)**: 95 mm
- **Resolving Power (R)**: 1 µm
- **Field of View (FOV)**:
  - FOV 1: Ø1.2 mm (when using Ø24 mm eyepiece)
  - FOV 2: 0.24 x 0.32 mm (when using a digital camera with 1/2" chip size)
- **Mass**: 240 g
- **Dimensions**: Not specified in the provided text.

#### Description:
The Mitutoyo M Plan APO SL 20X is a high-quality optical microscope objective designed for bright field inspection. It features a plan apochromat design, which ensures a flat image surface across the entire field of view, making it suitable for high-resolution imaging applications. The objective is infinity corrected, allowing for compatibility with various microscope types, including VMU, FS-70, MF-U, and Hyper MF-U.

#### Typical Applications:
The M Plan APO SL 20X is primarily used in microscopy for applications that require high precision and clarity, such as:
- **Biological Research**: Observing cellular structures and biological specimens.
- **Material Science**: Analyzing material properties and microstructures.
- **Quality Control**: Inspecting manufactured components for defects.
- **Education**: Teaching microscopy techniques in academic settings.

This objective is particularly beneficial in scenarios where long working distances are required, allowing for the observation of samples without interference from the microscope body.
