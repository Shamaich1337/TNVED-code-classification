This TVS protection product offers ±30 kV \nIEC air-gap, ±30 kV contact ESD protection, and has an ESD clamp circuit with a back-to-back TVS diode for \nbipolar or bidirectional signal support. The 12 pF line capacitance of this ESD protection diode is suitable for a \nwide range of applications supporting data rates up to 400 Mbps.\nTypical application of this ESD protection product is the circuit protection for audio lines (microphone, earphone, \nand speakerphone), SD interfacing, keypad or other buttons, VBUS pin and ID pin of USB ports, and general-\npurpose I/O ports. This ESD clamp is a good fit for the protection of the end equipment like ebooks, tablets, \nremote controllers, wearables, set-top boxes, and electronic point of sale equipment.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n1\n2\n7.3 Feature Description\nTPD1E10B06 is a bidirectional TVS with high ESD protection level. This device protects circuit from ESD strikes \nup to ±30 kV contact and ±30 kV air-gap specified in the IEC 61000-4-2 international standard. The device can \nalso handle up to 6-A surge current (IEC61000-4-5 8/20 µs). The I/O capacitance of 12 pF supports a data \nrate up to 400 Mbps. This clamping device has a small dynamic resistance of 0.4 Ω typically, which makes the \nclamping voltage low when the device is actively protecting other circuits. For example, the clamping voltage is \nonly 10 V when the device is taking 1-A transient current. The breakdown is bidirectional so that this protection \ndevice is a good fit for GPIO and especially audio lines which carry bidirectional signals. Low leakage allows \nthe diode to conserve power when working below the V RWM. The industrial temperature range of –40°C to \n125°C makes this ESD device work at extensive temperatures in most environments. The 0402 package can fit \ninto small electronic devices like mobile equipment and wearables whereas the SOD-523 package is good for \nindustrial applications.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\nTPD1E10B06 is a passive clamp that has low leakage during normal operation when the voltage between pin 1 \nand pin 2 is below V RWM and activates when the voltage between pin 1 and pin 2 goes above V BR. During IEC \nESD events, transient voltages as high as ±30 kV can be clamped between the two pins. When the voltages on \nthe protected lines fall below the trigger voltage, the device reverts back to the low leakage passive state.www.ti.comTPD1E10B06\nSLLSEB1F – FEBRUARY 2012 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPD1E10B06\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nWhen a system contains a human interface connector, the system becomes vulnerable to large system-level \nESD strikes that standard ICs cannot survive. TVS ESD protection diodes are typically used to suppress ESD at \nthese connectors. TPD1E10B06 is a single-channel ESD protection device containing back-to-back TVS diodes, \nwhich is typically used to provide a path to ground for dissipating ESD events on bidirectional signal lines \nbetween a human interface connector and a system. As the current from ESD passes through the device, only a \nsmall voltage drop is present across the diode structure. This is the voltage presented to the protected IC. The \nlow R DYN of the triggered TVS holds this voltage, V CLAMP , to a tolerable level to the protected IC.\n8.2 Typical Application\nSpeaker \nconnector \n(source of ESD)Audio amplifier \nclass AB \n(ESD sensitive)L Audio IN\nR Audio IN\n1 1\n2 2Audio amplifier \nclass AB \n(ESD sensitive)L Audio\nGND\nR Audio\nGNDL\nR\nGND\nFigure 8-1. Typical Application Schematic\n8.2.1 Design Requirements\nFor this design example, two TPD1E10B06s will be used to protect left and right audio channels. For this audio \napplication, the following system parameters are known.\nTable 8-1. Design Parameters\nDESIGN PARAMETER VALUE\nAudio Amplifier Class AB\nAudio signal voltage range –3 V to 3 V\nAudio frequency content 20 Hz to 20 kHz\nRequired IEC 61000-4-2 ESD Protection ±20 kV Contact/ ±25 kV Air-GapTPD1E10B06\nSLLSEB1F – FEBRUARY 2012 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPD1E10B06\n8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nTo begin the design process, some parameters must be decided upon; the designer should make sure:\n•Voltage range on the protected line must not exceed the reverse standoff voltage of one or more TVS diodes \n(VRWM)\n•Operating frequency is supported by the I/O capacitance C IO of the TVS diode\n•IEC 61000-4-2 protection requirement is covered by the IEC performance of the TVS diode\nFor this application, the audio signal voltage range is –3 V to 3 V. The V RWM for the TVS is –5.5 V to 5.5 V; \ntherefore, the bidirectional TVS will not break down during normal operation, and therefore normal operation of \nthe audio signal will not be effected due to the signal voltage range. In this application, a bidirectional TVS like \nTPD1E10B06 is required.\nNext, consider the frequency content of this audio signal. In this application with the class AB amplifier, the \nfrequency content is from 20 Hz to 20 kHz; ensure that the TVS I/O capacitance will not distort this signal by \nfiltering it. With TPD1E10B06 typical capacitance of 12 pF, which leads to a typical 3-dB bandwidth of 400 MHz, \nthis diode has sufficient bandwidth to pass the audio signal without distorting it.\nFinally, the human interface in this application requires above standard Level 4 IEC 61000-4-2 system-level \nESD protection (±8 kV Contact/ ±15 kV Air-Gap). A standard TVS cannot survive this level of IEC ESD stress. \nHowever, TPD1E10B06 can survive at least ±30 kV Contact/ ±30 kV Air-Gap. Therefore, the device can provide \nsufficient ESD protection for the interface, even though the requirements are stringent. For any TVS diode to \nprovide the full range of ESD protection capabilities, as well as to minimize the noise and EMI disturbances the \nboard will see during ESD events, a system designer must use proper board layout of their TVS ESD protection \ndiodes. See Section 10 for instructions on properly laying out TPD1E10B06.\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 8-2. IEC 61000-4-2 Clamp Voltage +8 kV \nContact ESD\nFigure 8-3.

#### Description:
The TPD1E10B06 is a single-channel ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) protection diode designed to safeguard sensitive electronic components from ESD events. It features a compact design suitable for space-constrained applications and is available in both a small 0402 package and an industry-standard SOD-523 package. The device employs back-to-back TVS (Transient Voltage Suppressor) diodes, allowing it to support bidirectional signals while providing robust protection against ESD strikes.

#### Typical Applications:
The TPD1E10B06 is commonly used in various applications, including:
- **End Equipment:**
  - Portable devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets)
  - Wearables (e.g., smartwatches, fitness trackers)
  - Set-top boxes
  - Electronic point-of-sale (EPOS) systems
  - Home appliances
  - Building automation systems

- **Interfaces:**
  - Audio lines (microphone, earphone, speakerphone)
  - Keypads and push-buttons
  - General-purpose input/output (GPIO) ports
  - USB ports (VBUS pin and ID pin)

This component is particularly effective in environments where ESD protection is critical, ensuring the reliability and longevity of electronic devices in consumer and industrial applications.
