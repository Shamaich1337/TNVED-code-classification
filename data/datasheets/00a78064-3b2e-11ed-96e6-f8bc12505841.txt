CMRR vs. Frequency, ±5 V S, Gain = +5 \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD627 is an integrated, micropower instrumentation \namplifier that delivers rail-to-ra il output swing on single and \ndual (+2.2 V to ±18 V) supplies. The AD627 provides excellent \nac and dc specifications while operating at only 85 μA maximum. \nThe AD627 offers superior flexibility by allowing the user to set \nthe gain of the device with a single external resistor while con-\nforming to the 8-lead industry-standard pinout configuration. \nWith no external resistor, the AD627 is configured for a gain of 5. \nWith an external resistor, it can be set to a gain of up to 1000.  \nA wide supply voltage range (+2.2 V to ±18 V) and micropower \ncurrent consumption make the AD627 a perfect fit for a wide \nrange of applications. Single-supply operation, low power consumption, and rail-to-rail output swing make the AD627 ideal for battery-powered applications. Its rail-to-rail output stage maximizes dynamic range when operating from low supply voltages. Dual-supply operation (±15 V) and low power consumption make the AD627 ideal for industrial applications, \nincluding 4 mA to 20 mA loop-powered systems. \nThe AD627 does not compromise performance, unlike other \nmicropower instrumentation amplifiers. Low voltage offset, \noffset drift, gain error, and gain drift minimize errors in the system. The AD627 also minimizes errors over frequency by \nproviding excellent CMRR over frequency. Because the CMRR remains high up to 200 Hz, line noise and line harmonics are \nrejected. \nThe AD627 provides superior performance, uses less circuit \nboard area, and costs less than micropower discrete designs. \n \nAD627 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

E | Page 14 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe AD627  is a true instrumentation amplifier, built using two \nfeedback loops. Its general properties are similar to those of t he \nclassic two -op-amp instrumentation amplifier configuration but \ninternally the details are so mewhat different. The AD627  uses a \nmodified current feedback scheme, which, coupled with interstage \nfeedforward frequency compensation, results in a much better common -mode rejection ratio  (CMRR) at fr equencies above  \ndc (notably the line frequency of 50  Hz to 60  Hz) than might \notherwise be expected of a low power instrumentation amplifier.  \nIn Figure 35, A1 completes a feedback loop that , in conjunction \nwith V 1 and R5, forces a constant collector current in Q1. Assume  \nthat the gain -setting resistor (R\nG) is not present. Resistor s R2 \nand R1 complete the loop and force the output of A1 to be equal to the voltage on the inverting terminal with a gain of nearly 1.25. A2 completes a nearly identical feedback loop that forces  a current in Q2 that is nearly identical to that in Q1; A2 also provides the output voltage. When both loops are balanced, the \ngain from the noninverting terminal to V\nOUT is equal to 5, \nwhereas t he gain from the output of A1 to V OUT is equal to −4.  The inverting terminal gain of A1 (1.25) times the gain of A2 \n(−4) makes the gain from the inverting and noninverting \nterminals equal.  \nThe differential mode gain is equal to 1 + R4/R3, nominally 5, \nand is factory trimmed to 0.01% final a ccuracy. Adding an \nexternal gain setting resistor (R G) increases the gain by an \namount equal to (R4 + R1)/R G. The output voltage of the \nAD627  is given by  \nVOUT = [VIN(+) – VIN(−)] × (5 + 200 kΩ/ RG) + VREF (1) \nLaser trims are performed on R1 through R4 to ensure that their values are as close as possible to the absolute values in the gain equation. This ensures low gain error and high common -\nmode rejection at all practical gains.  \n \nRGEXTERNAL GAIN RESISTOR\nREF\n–IN +IN+VS\n–VS\n–VS–VS+VSR1\n100kΩ\nR2\n25kΩ\nR5\n200kΩR6\n200kΩR3\n25kΩ\n2kΩ 2kΩ\n0.1V V1A2A1Q1 Q2\nOUTPUTR4\n100kΩ\n00782-033 \nFigure 35. Simplified  Schematic   \n \nData Sheet AD627 \n \nRev. E | Page 15 of 24 USING THE AD627 \nBASIC CONNECTIONS  \nFigure 36 shows the basic connection circuit for the AD627 . \nThe +V S and −V S terminals connect to the power supply. The \nsupply can be either bipolar (V S = ±1.1 V to ±18 V) or single \nsupply (−V S = 0 V , +V S = 2.2 V to 36 V). Capacitively decouple \nthe power supplies close to the power pins  of the device . For \nbest results, use surface -mount 0.1 µF ceramic chip capacitors.  \nThe input voltage can be single -ended (tie either −IN or +IN to \nground) or differential. The difference between the voltage on the \ninverting and noninverting pins is amplified by the programmed gain.  The gain resistor programs the gain as described in the \nSetting the Gain  and Reference Terminal  sections. Basic \nconnections  are shown in Figure 36. The output signal appears \nas the voltage difference between the output pin and the \nexternally applied voltage on the REF pin, as shown in Figure 37. \n SETTING THE GAIN  \nThe gain of the AD627  is resistor programmed by R G, or, more  \nprecisely, by whatever impedance appears between Pin 1 and Pin 8.   \nThe gain is set according to  \nGain  = 5 + (200 kΩ/ RG) or R G = 200 kΩ/( Gain − 5) (2) \nTherefore, the minimum achievable gain is 5 (for 200 kΩ / \n(Gain − 5)). With an internal gain accuracy of between 0.05% \nand 0.7%, depending on gain and grade, a 0.1% external gain \nresistor is appropriate to prevent significant degradation of the \noverall gain error. However, 0.1% r esistors are not available in a \nwide range of values and are quite expensive.  Table 6 shows \nrecommended gain resistor values using 1% resistors. For all \ngains, the size of the gain resistor is conservatively chosen as the closest value from the standard resistor table that is higher than \nthe ideal value. This results in a gain that is always slightly less \nthan the desired gain , thereby preventing clipping of the signal \nat the output due to resistor tolerance.  \nThe internal resistors  on the AD627  have a negative temperature \ncoefficient of −75 ppm/°C max imum  for gains > 5. Using a  \ngain resistor that also has a negative temperature coefficient  \nof −75  ppm/°C or less tends to reduce  the overall gain drift of \nthe circuit.  \n \n+IN\nVOUTVIN\n–IN\nREF (INPUT)\n–1.1V TO –18V+1.1V TO +18V\nRG+VS\n–VSRG\nRGOUTPUT\nREF\n0.1µF0.1µF\n+IN\nVOUTVIN\n–IN\nREF (INPUT)\nGAIN = 5 + (200kΩ/R G)+2.2V TO +36V\nRG+VS\nRG\nRGOUTPUT\nREF0.1µF\n00782-034 \nFigure 36.

It provides a direct means of \ninjecting a precise offset to the output. The reference terminal is also useful when amplifying bipolar signals, because it provides \na virtual ground voltage.  \nThe AD627  output voltage is developed with respect to the poten -\ntial on the reference terminal; therefore, tying the REF pin to the \nappropriate local ground solves many grounding problems. For  \noptimal CMR , tie the REF pin to a low impedance point.  \nINPUT RANGE LIMITATI ONS IN SINGLE -SUPPLY \nAPPLICATIONS  \nIn general, the maximum achievable gain is determined by the \navailable output signal range. However, in single -supply applica -\ntions where the input common -mode voltage is nearly or equal \nto 0, some limitations on the gain can be set. Although the \nSpecifications  section  nominally define s the input, output, and \nreference pin ranges, the voltage ranges on these pins are \nmutually interdep endent. Figure 37 shows the simplified \nschematic of the AD627 , driven by a differential voltage (V DIFF) \nthat has a common -mode component, V CM. The voltage on t he \nA1 op amp output is a function of V DIFF, V CM, the voltage on the \nREF pin, and the programmed gain. This voltage is given by  \nVA1 = 1.25 ( VCM + 0.5 V) − 0.25 VREF − VDIFF (25 kΩ/ RG + 0.625)  (3) The voltage on A1 can also be expressed as a function of the \nactual voltages on the – IN and +IN pins (V− and V+) such that  \nVA1 = 1.25 ( (V−) + 0.5 V) − 0.25 VREF − ((V+) − (V−)) 25 kΩ/ RG (4) \nThe output of A1 is ca pable of swinging to within 50 mV of the \nnegative rail and to within 200 mV of the positive rail. It is clear, \nfrom either Equation 3  or Equation 4 , that an increasing V REF \n(while it acts as a positive offset at the output of the AD627 ) \ntends to decrease the voltage on A1. Figure 38 and Figure 39 \nshow the maximum voltages that can be applied to the REF pin \nfor a gain  of 5 for both the single -supply and dual -supply cases.

However, in single -supply applications \nwhere the common -mode voltage is low, a differential input \nvoltage or a voltage on REF that is too high can drive the output \nof A1 into the ground rail. Some low -side headroom is added \nbecause both inputs are shifted upwards by about 0.5 V (that is, \nby the V BE of Q1 and Q2). Use Equation 3  and Equation 4 to \ncheck whether the voltage on Amplifier A1 is within its \noperating  range.  \n \nData Sheet AD627 \n \nRev. E | Page 17 of 24 Table 7.

E | Page 18 of 24 MAKE vs . BUY: A TYPICAL APPLICATION ERROR \nBUDGET  \nThe example in Figure 41 serves as a good comparison between \nthe errors associated with an integrated and a discrete in -amp \nimplementation. A ±100 mV signal from a resistive bridge \n(common -mode voltage = 2.5 V) is amplified. This example \ncompares the  resulting errors from a discrete two -op-amp \ninstrumentation amp lifier  and the AD627 . The discrete \nimplementation uses a four -resistor precision network \n(1% match, 50 ppm/°C tracking).  The errors associated with each implementation (see Table 9) \nshow the integrated in -amp to be more precise at both ambient \nand overtemperature. Note that the discrete implementation is \nmore expensive, primarily due to the rel atively high cost of the \nlow drift precision resistor network.  \nThe input offset current of the discrete instrumentation amplifier  \nimplementation is the difference in the bias currents of the two -\nop amp lifier s, not the offset currents of the individual op a mps. \nIn addition, although the values of the resistor network are chosen so that the inverting and noninverting inputs of each op amp \nsee the same impedance (about 350 Ω), the offset current of \neach op amp adds another error that must be characterized.  \n \nVOUTVOUT\n+2.5V\n+2.5V+5V +5V\nAD627A GAIN = 9.98 (5+(200kΩ/R G)) HOMEBREW IN-AMP, G = +10\n*1% RESISTOR MATCH, 50ppm/°C TRACKINGRG\n40.2kΩ\n1%\n+10ppm/°CAD627A+5V\n350Ω\n350Ω350Ω\n350Ω\n3.15kΩ* 350Ω* 350Ω* 3.15kΩ*±100mV1/2LT10781SBLT10781SB\n1/2\n00782-039 \nFigure 41.

E | Page 19 of 24 ERRORS DUE TO AC CMR R \nIn Table 9, the error due to common -mode rejection results \nfrom the common -mode voltage from the bridge 2.5  V.  T h e  \nac error due to less than ideal common -mode rejection cannot \nbe calculated without knowing the size of the ac common -mode \nvoltage (usually interference from 50  Hz/60  Hz mains frequencies).  \nA mismatch of 0.1% between the four gain setting resistors \ndetermines the low frequency CMRR of a two -op-amp  \ninstrumentation am plifier . The plot in Figure 43 shows the \npractical results of resistor mismatch at ambient temperature.  \nThe CMRR of the circuit in Figure 42 (Gain = +11 ) was \nmeasured using four resistors with a mismatch of nearly 0.1 % \n(R1 = 9999.5 Ω, R2 = 999.76 Ω, R3 = 1000.2 Ω, R4 = 9997.7 Ω). \nAs expected, the CMRR at dc was measured at about 84 dB (calculated value is 85 dB). However, as frequency increases, \nCMRR quickly degrades. For example, a 200 mV p -p harmonic \nof the mains fre quency at 180 Hz would result in an output \nvoltage of about 800 µV . To put this in context, a 12- bit data \nacquisition system, with an input range of 0 V to 2.5 V , has an \nLSB weighting of 610 µ V. \nBy contrast, the AD627  uses precision laser trimming of internal  \nresistors, along with patented CMR trimming, to yield a higher \ndc CMRR and a wider bandwidth over which the CMRR is flat \n(see Figure 23). \nVOUT+5V\nVIN–\nVIN+\n–5V\nR1\n9999.5ΩR2\n999.76ΩR3\n1000.2ΩR4\n9997.7Ω1/2\nOP296A1A2\n1/2\nOP296\n00782-040 \nFigure 42. 0.1% Resistor Mismatch Example  \nFREQUENCY (Hz)CMRR (dB)120\n1110\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10 100 1k 10k 100k\n00782-041 \nFigure 43. CMRR  over Frequency of Discrete In -Amp in Figure 42 \n GROUND RETURNS FOR I NPUT BIAS CURRENTS  \nInput bias currents are dc c urrents that must flow to bias the \ninput transistors of an amplifier. They are usually transistor base currents. When amplifying floating input sources, such as transformers or ac -coupled sources, there must be a direct dc \npath into each input so that the bias current can flow. Figure 44, \nFigure 45, and Figure 46 show how to provide a bias current \npath for the cases of, respect ively, transformer coupling, a \nthermocouple application, and capacitive ac -coupling.  \nIn dc -coupled resistive bridge applications, providing this path \nis generally not necessary because the bias current simply flows from the bridge supply through the bridge  and into the amplifier.  \nHowever, if the impedance that the two inputs see are large, and \ndiffer by a large amount (>10 kΩ), the offset current of the input \nstage causes dc errors compatible with the input offset voltage of \nthe amplifier.  \nVOUT\nTO POWER\nSUPPLY\nGROUNDRG\n–VS+VS\nAD6277\n45 8\n3612\nREFERENCE +INPUT–INPUT\nLOAD\n00782-042 \nFigure 44.

E | Page 20 of 24 LAYOUT AND GROUNDING \nThe use of ground planes is recommended to minimize the \nimpedance of ground returns (and hence, the size of dc errors). \nTo isolate low level analog signals from a noisy digital environment, many data acquisition components have separate analog and \ndigital ground returns (see Figure 47). Return all ground pins \nfrom mixed-signal components, such as analog-to-digital converters, through the high quality analog ground plane. Digital ground lines of mixed-signal components should also  be returned through the analog ground plane. This may seem  to break the rule of separating analog and digital grounds; \nhowever, in general, there is also a requirement to keep the \nvoltage difference between digital and analog grounds on a converter as small as possible (typically, <0.3 V). The increased noise, caused by the digital return currents of the converter flowing through the analog ground plane, is generally negligible. \nTo maximize isolation between analog and digital, connect the \nground planes back at the supplies. If there is only one power supply available, it must be shared by \nboth digital and analog circuitry. Figure 48 shows how to minimize interference between the digital and analog circuitry. As in the previous case, use separate analog and digital ground planes or \nuse reasonably thick traces as an alternative to a digital ground \nplane. Connect the ground planes at the ground pin of the power supply. Run separate traces (or power planes) from the power supply to the supply pins of the digital and analog circuits. Ideally, each device should have its own power supply trace, but they \ncan be shared by multiple devices if a single trace is not used to \nroute current to both digital and analog circuitry. \n \nVIN1 VDD\nVIN2AD6277\n4\n41 6 14\n35 362\nAD627\nAD7892-20.1µF 0.1µF 0.1µF 0.1µFANALOG POWER SUPPLY\n+5V –5V GND\nAGND VDD\nMICRO-\nPROCESSORAGND\nADCDGNDDIGITAL POWER SUPPLY\n+5V GND\n12\n00782-045 \nFigure 47.

E | Page 21 of 24 INPUT PROTECTION \nAs shown in the simplified schematic (see Figure 35), both the \ninverting and noninverting inputs are clamped to the positive \nand negative supplies by ESD diodes. In addition, a 2 kΩ series resistor on each input provides current limiting in the event of \nan overvoltage. These ESD diodes can tolerate a maximum \ncontinuous current of 10 mA. So an overvoltage (that is, the amount by which the input voltage exceeds the supply voltage) of ±20 V can be tolerated. This is true for all gains, and for power on and off. This last case is particularly important because the signal source and amplifier can be powered separately. \nIf the overvoltage is expected to exceed 20 V , use additional \nexternal series current-limiting resistors to keep the diode \ncurrent below 10 mA. \nRF INTERFERENCE \nAll instrumentation amplifiers can rectify high frequency out-\nof-band signals. Once rectified, these signals appear as dc offset \nerrors at the output. The circuit in Figure 49 provides good RFI suppression without reducing performance within the pass band of the instrumentation amplifier. Resistor R1 and \nCapacitor C1 (and likewise, R2 and C2) form a low-pass RC \nfilter that has a –3 dB BW equal to \nf = 1/(2π(R1  × C1)) (7) \nUsing the component values shown in Figure 49, this filter has  \na –3 dB bandwidth of approximately 8 kHz. Resistor R1 and Resistor R2 were selected to be large enough to isolate the circuit input from the capacitors but not large enough to significantly \nincrease circuit noise. To preserve common-mode rejection in \nthe amplifier pass band, Capacitor C1 and Capacitor C2 must be 5% mica units, or low cost 20% units can be tested and binned \nto provide closely matched devices. Capacitor C3 is needed to maintain common-mode rejection at \nlow frequencies. R1/R2 and C1/C2 form a bridge circuit whose output appears across the input pins of the in-amp. Any mismatch between C1 and C2 unbalances the bridge and reduces common-\nmode rejection. C3 ensures that any RF signals are common \nmode (the same on both in-amp inputs) and are not applied differentially. This second low-pass network, R1 + R2 and C3, \nhas a −3 dB frequency equal to \n1/(2π((R1 + R2) × C3)) (8) \n+IN\nVOUT+VS\n–VSC1\n1000pF\n5%\nC2\n1000pF\n5%REFERENCERG0.01µF\n0.01µFC3\n0.022µF0.33µF\n0.33µFR1\n20kΩ\n1%\nR2\n20kΩ\n1%\nAD627\n–IN\n00782-047 \nFigure 49. Circuit to A ttenuate RF Interference \nUsing a C3 value of 0.022 μF, as shown in Figure 49, the −3 dB \nsignal bandwidth of this circuit is approximately 200 Hz. The typical dc offset shift over frequency is less than 1 mV and the \nRF signal rejection of the circuit is better than 57 dB. To increase \nthe 3 dB signal bandwidth of this circuit, reduce the value of Resistor R1 and Resistor R2. The performance is similar to that when using 20 kΩ resistors, except that the circuitry preceding  \nthe in-amp must drive a lower impedance load. \nWhen building a circuit like that shown in Figure 49, use a PC \nboard with a ground plane on both sides. Make all component \nleads as short as possible. Resistor R1 and Resistor R2 can be \ncommon 1% metal film units, but Capacitor C1 and Capacitor C2 must be ±5% tolerance devices to avoid degrading the common-mode rejection of the circuit. Either the traditional 5% silver mica \nunits or Panasonic ±2% PPS film capacitors are recommended. \nAD627 Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 22 of 24 APPLICATIONS CIRCUIT S \nCLASSIC BRIDGE CIRCUIT  \nFigure 50 shows the AD627  configured to amplify the signal \nfrom a classic resistive bridge. This circuit works in dual -supply \nmode or single -supply mode. Typically, the same voltage that \npowers the instrumentation amplifiers  excites the bridge. \nConnecting the bottom of the bridge to the negative  supply of \nthe instrumentation amplifiers  (usually 0 V , −5 V , −12 V , or \n−15 V), sets up an input common -mode voltage that is \noptimally located midway between the supply voltages. It is  \nalso appropriate to set the voltage on the REF pin to midway \nbetween the supplies, especially if the input sign al is bipolar. \nHowever, the voltage on the REF pin can be varied to suit the application. For example, the REF pin is tied to the V\nREF pin of \nan analog -to-digital converter (ADC) whose input range is \n(V REF ± V IN). With an available output swing on the AD627  of \n(−V S + 100  mV) to (+V S − 150  mV), the maximum programmable \ngain is simply this output range divided by the input range.  \nVOUT VDIFF+VS\n–VSVREF0.1µF\n0.1µFAD627RG =200kΩ\nGAIN–5\n00782-048 \nFigure 50. Classic Bridge Circuit  4 m A TO 20 m A SINGLE-SUPPLY RECEIVER  \nFigure 51 shows how a signal from a 4 mA to 20 mA transducer \ncan be interfaced to the ADuC812, a 12 -bit ADC with an \nembedded microcontroller. The signal from a 4 mA to 20 mA \ntransducer is sing le-ended , which  initially suggests the need for \na simple shunt resistor to convert the current to a voltage at the high impedance analog input of the converter. However, any \nline resistance in the return path (to the transducer) adds a \ncurrent dependent of fset error ; therefore, the current must be \nsensed differentially.  \nIn this example, a 24.9 Ω shunt resistor generates a maximum differential input voltage to the AD627  of between 100 mV  \n(for 4 mA i n) and 500 mV (for 20 mA in). With no gain resistor \npresent, the AD627 amplifies the 500 mV input voltage by a \nfactor of 5, to 2.5 V , the full- scale input voltage of the ADC. The \nzero current of 4 mA corresponds to a code of 819 and the LSB \nsize is 4.88 μA. \nTHERMOCOUPLE AMPLIFI ER \nBecause the common -mode input range of the AD627  extends \n0.1 V below ground, it is possible to measure small differential \nsignals that have a low, or no, common -mode com ponent. \nFigure 51 shows a thermocouple application where one side of \nthe J -type thermocouple is grounded.  \nOver a temperature range from −200°C to +200°C, the J -type \nthermocouple delivers a voltage ranging from −7.8 90 mV to \n+10.777 mV . A programmed gain on the AD627 of 100 (R G = \n2.1 kΩ) and a voltage on the AD627 REF pin of 2  V result in the \noutput vo ltage of the AD627  ranging from 1.110 V to 3.077 V \nrelative to ground. For a different input range or different \nvoltage on the REF pin, it is important to verify that the voltage on Internal Node A 1 (see Figure 37) is not driven below \nground. This can be checked using the equations in the Input \nRange Limitations in Single -Supply Applications  section.  \nVOUT5V\nVREF0.1µF\nAD627RG\n2.1kΩJ-TYPE\nTHERMOCOUPLE\nREF\n00782-050 \nFigure 51.
