reverse-blocking FET (RBFET, Q1), high-side switching FET (HSFET, \nQ2), low-side switching FET (LSFET, Q3), and battery FET (BATFET, Q4) between system and battery. It also \nintegrates the bootstrap diode for the high-side gate drive for simplified system design. The hardware setting and \nstatus report provides easy configuration to set up the charging solution.\nThe device supports a wide range of input sources, including standard USB host port, USB charging port, USB \ncompliant high voltage adapter and wireless power. It is compliant with USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 power spec \nwith input current and voltage regulation. The device sets default input current limit based on the built-in USB \ndetection through D+/D- pins . When the device built-in USB interface identifies the input adaptor is unknown, \nthe device\'s input current limit is determined by the ILIM pin setting resistor value.\nThe device integrates the buck charger and boost regulator into one solution with single inductor. It meets USB \nOn-The-Go (OTG) operation power rating specification by supplying 5V with constant current limit up to 1.2-A.\nThe Power Path management regulates the system slightly above battery voltage but does not drop below \n3.5-V minimum system voltage with adapter applied. With this feature, the system maintains operation even \nwhen the battery is completely depleted or removed. When the input current limit or voltage limit is reached, the \nPower Path management automatically reduces the charge current. As the system load continues to increase, \nthe battery starts to discharge the battery until the system power requirement is met. This supplement mode \nprevents overloading the input source.\nThe device initiates and completes a charging cycle without software control. It senses the battery voltage and \ncharges the battery in three phases: pre-conditioning, constant current and constant voltage. At the end of \nthe charging cycle, the charger automatically terminates when the charge current is below a preset limit and \nthe battery voltage is higher than the recharge threshold. If the fully charged battery falls below the recharge \nthreshold, the charger automatically starts another charging cycle.\nThe charger provides various safety features for battery charging and system operations, including battery \nnegative temperature coefficient thermistor monitoring, charging safety timer and overvoltage and over-current \nprotections. Thermal regulation reduces charge current when the junction temperature exceeds 110°C. The \nSTAT output  reports the charging status and any fault conditions.www.ti.comBQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\n6 Device Comparison Table\nBQ25606 BQ25616 BQ25616J\nQuiescent battery current (BAT, \nSYS, SW)58 µA 9.5 µA 9.5 µA\nVBUS OVP Reaction-time 200 ns 130 ns 130 ns\nInput voltage regulation accuracy ±3% ±2% ±2%\nTS profile JEITA Hot/Cold JEITA\nCharge safety timer accuracy 10 hr 10 hr 10 hr\nCharge voltage limit 4.2 V/4.35 V/4.4 V 4.1 V/4.2 V/4.35 V 4.1 V/4.2 V/4.35 V\nBattery voltage regulation ±0.5% ±0.4% ±0.4%\nACDRV No Yes YesBQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n4 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\n7 Pin Configuration and Functions\n24 VBUS 7 PG1 VAC 18  GND23 PMID 8 ILIM2 ACDRV 17  GND22 REGN 9 CE3 D+ 16  SYS21 BTST 10 ICHG4 D± 15  SYS20 SW 11 TS5 STAT 14  BAT19 SW 12 VSET6 OTG 13  BAT\nNot to scaleThermal\nPad\nFigure 7-1.

When V VBUS rises above \nVVBUS_UVLOZ  or V BAT rises above V BAT_UVLOZ , the sleep comparator, battery depletion comparator, and BATFET \ndriver are active.\n9.3.2 Device Power Up From Battery Without Input Source\nIf only the battery is present and the voltage is above depletion threshold (V BAT _DPLZ ), the BATFET turns on and \nconnects the battery to the system. The REGN stays off to minimize the quiescent current. The low R DSON  of \nBATFET and the low quiescent current on BAT minimize the conduction loss and maximize the battery run time.\nThe device always monitors the discharge current through the BATFET. When the system is overloaded or \nshorted (I BAT > ISYS_OCP_Q4 ), the device turns off BATFET immediately  until the input source plugs in again .\n9.3.3 Power Up From Input Source\nWhen an input source is plugged in, the device checks the input source voltage to turn on the REGN LDO and \nall the bias circuits. It detects and sets the input current limit before the buck converter is started. The power-up \nsequence from input source is as listed:\n1.Power Up ACFET, see Section 9.3.3.1  (optional)\n2.Power Up REGN LDO, see Section 9.3.3.2\n3.Poor Source Qualification, see Section 9.3.3.3\n4.Input Source Type Detection is based on D+/D–  to set default input current limit (IINDPM threshold), see \nSection 9.3.3.4\n5.Input Voltage Limit Threshold Setting (VINDPM threshold), see Section 9.3.3.5\n6.Power Up Converter, see Section 9.3.3.6\n9.3.3.1 Power Up ACFET\nThe external ACFET provides an additional layer of voltage protection for the device. During input surge up to 30 \nV, the charger turns off ACFET and converter with 130-ns response time to disconnect VBUS from VAC. If users \ndon\'t need ACFET, they shall connect VAC to VBUS and keep ACDRV pin floating. The ACFET is enabled when \nall the below conditions are valid.\nThe ACFET is enabled when all the below conditions are valid.\n•VVAC_PRESENT  < V VAC < V ACOV .\n•After t DEB (15 ms typ) delay is completed\nIf one of the above conditions is not valid, ACFET keeps off. The battery powers the system If it is present.www.ti.comBQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\nVAC*VVAC_PRESENT (rising)\nACDRV tDEBtON_VBUS\n10%90%\nVBUS\n10%90%\n(*) Stimulus from application\nNote: beginning of blue lines indicate the trigger, and the arrow end of the blue line indicates the actionVACOV (rising)\nVVAC_PRESENT (rising)  < VAC < V ACOV (rising)  \nmust be valid before ACDRV goes high.Figure 9-1. ACFET Startup Control\n9.3.3.2 Power Up REGN LDO\nThe REGN LDO supplies internal bias circuits as well as the HSFET and LSFET gate drive. It also provides the \nbias rail to TS external resistors. The pull-up rail of STAT can be connected to REGN as well. The REGN LDO is \nenabled when all the below conditions are valid:\n•VVBUS > V VBUS_UVLOZ\n•In buck mode, ACFET turns on,  VVBUS > V BAT + V SLEEPZ\n•In boost mode, V VBUS < V BAT + V SLEEPZ\n•After 220-ms delay is completed\nDuring high impedance mode , REGN LDO turns off. The battery powers up the system.\n9.3.3.3 Poor Source Qualification\nAfter the REGN LDO powers up, the device starts to check current capability of the input source. The first step is \npoor source detection.\n•VBUS voltage above V POORSRC  when pulling I BADSRC  (typical 30 mA)\nIf the device fails the poor source detection, it repeats poor source qualification every 2 seconds.\n9.3.3.4 Input Source Type Detection (IINDPM Threshold)\nAfter poor source detection, the device runs input source detection through D+/D– lines  . The D+/D– detection \nfollows the USB Battery Charging Specification 1.2 (BC1.2) to detect standard (SDP/CDP/DCP) and non-\nstandard adapters through USB D+/D– lines.\n9.3.3.4.1 D+/D– Detection Sets Input Current Limit\nThe device contains a D+/D– based input source detection to set the input current limit when a 5-V adapter \nis plugged-in. The D+/D– detection includes standard USB BC1.2 and non-standard adapters. When an input \nsource is plugged in, the device starts standard USB BC1.2 detection. The USB BC1.2 is capable of identifying \nStandard Downstream Port (SDP), Charging Downstream Port (CDP) and Dedicated Charging Port (DCP). The \nnon-standard detection is used to distinguish vendor specific adapters (Apple and Samsung) based on their \nunique dividers on the D+/D– pins. If an adapter is detected as DCP, the input current limit is set at 2.4-A. If an \nadapter is detected as unknown, the input current limit is set by ILIM pin .\nThe D+/D– automatically runs when adapter plugs in. The D+/D– detection contains three steps, DCD (Data \nContact Detection), primary detection, and secondary detection.\nDCD (Data Contact Detection) uses a current source to detect when the D+/D– pins have made contact during \nan attach event. The protocol for data contact detect is as follows:BQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\n•Detect VBUS present and VBUS_GD (pass poor source detection)\n•Turn on D+ I DP_SRC  and the D– pull-down resistor R DM_DWN  for 13 ms\n•If the USB connector is properly attached, the D+ line goes from HIGH to LOW, wait up to 0.5 sec. When the \nDCD timer of 0.5 sec is expired, the non-standard adapter detection is applied to set the input current limit.\n•Turn off I DP_SRC  and disconnect R DM_DWN\nThe primary detection is used to distinguish between USB host (Standard Down Stream Port, or SDP) and \ndifferent type of charging ports (Charging Down Stream Port, or CDP, and Dedicated Charging Port, or DCP). \nThe protocol for primary detection is as follows:\n•Turn on V DP_SRC  on D+ and I DM_Sink  on D– for 40 ms\n•If portable device is attached to a USB host (SDP), the D– is below V REF_DAT . Otherwise, it is attached to \neither CDP or DCP.\n•Turn off V DP_SRC  and I DM_Sink\nThe secondary detection is used to distinguish two types of charging ports (CDP and DCP). The protocol for \nsecondary detection is as follows:\n•Turn on V DM_SRC  on D- and I DP_Sink  on D+ for 40 ms\n•If portable device is attached to a Charging Downstream Port (CDP), the D+ is below V DAT_REF . Otherwise, it \nis attached to DCP.\n•Turn off V DM_SRC  and I DP_Sink\nMost of the time, a CDP requires the portable device (such as smart phone, tablet) to send back an enumeration \nwithin 2.5 seconds of CDP plug-in. Otherwise, the port will power cycle back to SDP even the D+/D– detection \nindicates CDP.\nTable 9-1.

VINDPM is set at 4.3 V .\n•VINDPM threshold tracks the battery voltage to optimize the converter headroom between input and output. \nThe actual input voltage limit is the higher of the VINDPM setting (4.3-V)  and V BAT + 200 mV .\n9.3.3.6 Power Up Converter in Buck Mode\nAfter the input current limit is set, the converter is enabled and the HSFET and LSFET start switching. The \nsystem voltage is powered from the converter instead of the battery. If battery charging is disabled, the BATFET \nturns off. Otherwise, the BATFET stays on to charge the battery.www.ti.comBQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\nThe device provides soft start when the system rail is ramping up. When the system rail is below V BAT_SHORT , the \ninput current is limited to 200 mA . The system load should be appropriately planned not to exceed the 200-mA \nIINDPM limit. After the system rises above V BAT_SHORTZ , the device input current limit is the value set the by ILIM \npin .\nAs a battery charger, the device deploys a highly efficient 1.5-MHz step-down switching regulator. The fixed \nfrequency oscillator keeps tight control of the switching frequency under all conditions of input voltage, battery \nvoltage, charge current, and temperature simplifying output filter design.\nThe converter supports PFM operation by default for fast transient response during system voltage regulation \nand better light load efficiency.\n9.3.4 Boost Mode Operation From Battery\nThe device supports boost converter operation to deliver power from the battery to other portable devices \nthrough a USB port. The output voltage is regulated at 5 V and output current is up to 1.2 A with constant current \nregulation . \nBoost operation is enabled if the conditions below are valid:\n1.OTG pin HIGH\n2.VBUS less than V BAT + V SLEEP  (in sleep mode) before converter starts.\n3.Voltage at TS (thermistor) pin, as a percentage of V REGN , is within acceptable range (V BHOT_RISE%  < V TS% < \nVBCOLD_FALL% )\n4.After 30-ms delay from boost mode enable .\n5.Not in any fault such as I SYS_OCP_Q4 , TSHUT, ACOV or VBUS OV.\nThe converter supports PFM operation at light load in Boost mode.\n9.3.5 Standalone Charger\nThe BQ25616/616J is a standalone device without host control. Any change on CE, ICHG and ILIM pins will \ncause a real time internal reference change. Charging is enabled or disabled via the CE pin. D+/D– and ILIM \npins control the input current limit settings. D+/D– detection and VSET pin setting only takes effect upon adapter \nplug-in.\nCharge current must be programmed to a value within a range of 300 mA to 3000 mA with a pull-down resistor \non the ICHG pin. The charge current is set as:\nIICHG = K ICHG/RICHG (1)\nInput current limit must be programmed to a value within a range of 500 mA to 3200 mA with a pull-down resistor \non the ILIM pin. The input current limit is set as:\nIIINDPM  = K ILIM/RILIM (2)\nThe battery regulation voltage is programmed with a pull-down resistor on the VSET pin as follows:\n•RVSET > 50 kΩ (float pin): V REG = 4.20 V\n•RVSET < 500 Ω (short pin): V REG = 4.35 V\n•5kΩ < R VSET < 25 kΩ: V REG = 4.10 V\nTable 9-3.

STAT pin will stop blinking when the fault goes away. \nAll faults will be reset upon adapter re-connection. A boost mode fault will be cleared either by adapter \nre-connection or toggling of the OTG pin.\n9.3.6 Power Path Management\nThe device accommodates a wide range of input sources such as USB, wall adapter, or car charger. The device \nprovides automatic power path selection to supply the system (SYS) from the input source (VBUS), battery \n(BAT), or both.\n9.3.6.1 Narrow VDC Architecture\nWhen the battery is below the minimum system voltage setting, the BATFET operates in linear mode (LDO \nmode), and the system is typically 180 mV above the minimum system voltage setting. As the battery voltage \nrises above the minimum system voltage, the BATFET is fully on and the voltage difference between the system \nand battery is the V DS of the BATFET.\nWhen battery charging is disabled and above the minimum system voltage setting or charging is terminated, the \nsystem is always regulated at typically 50 mV above the battery voltage.\nBAT (V)SYS (V)\n2.7 2.9 3.1 3.3 3.5 3.7 3.9 4.1 4.33.13.33.53.73.94.14.34.5\nD002Minimum System Voltage\nCharge Disabled\nCharge Enabled\nFigure 9-2. System Voltage vs Battery Voltage\n9.3.6.2 Dynamic Power Management\nTo meet the maximum current limit in the USB specification and avoid overloading the adapter, the device \nfeatures Dynamic Power Management (DPM), which continuously monitors the input current and input voltage. \nWhen input source is overloaded, either the current exceeds the input current limit (IINDPM) or the voltage falls \nbelow the input voltage limit (VINDPM). The device then reduces the charge current until the input current falls \nbelow the input current limit or the input voltage rises above the input voltage limit.\nWhen the charge current is reduced to zero, but the input source is still overloaded, the system voltage starts to \ndrop. Once the system voltage falls below the battery voltage, the device automatically enters the supplement \nmode where the BATFET turns on and the battery starts discharging so that the system is supported from both \nthe input source and battery.www.ti.comBQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\nFigure 9-3  shows the DPM response with 9-V/1.2-A adapter, 3.2-V battery, 2.8-A charge current and 3.5-V \nminimum system voltage setting.\n9V\nCurrent\n2.8A4A\n-0.6A3.2A\n0.5A3.6V\n3.4V\n3.2V\n3.18V\n1.2A\n1.0A\nDPM DPM\nSupplementVoltage\nSYSVBUS\nBAT\nICHG\nIINISYS\nFigure 9-3.

This prevents oscillation \nfrom entering and exiting the supplement mode.\nAs the discharge current increases, the BATFET gate is regulated with a higher voltage to reduce R DSON  until \nthe BATFET is in full conduction. At this point onwards, the BATFET V DS linearly increases with discharge \ncurrent. Figure 9-4  shows the V-I curve of the BATFET gate regulation operation.

When a fully charged battery is discharged below recharge threshold, the device automatically starts \na new charging cycle. After the charge is done, a toggle of the CE pin initiates a new charging cycle. Adapter \nremoval and replug will also restart a charging cycle.\nThe STAT output indicates charging status: charging (LOW), charging complete or charge disable (HIGH), or \ncharging fault (blinking).\n9.3.7.2 Battery Charging Profile\nThe device charges the battery in five phases: battery short, preconditioning, constant current, constant voltage, \nand top-off trickle charging.

After the charging cycle has completed, the BATFET turns off. STAT is asserted \nHIGH to indicate charging is done. The converter keeps running to power the system, and BATFET can turn on \nagain to engage Section 9.3.6.3 .\nIf the device is in IINDPM/VINDPM regulation, or thermal regulation, the actual charging current will be less than \nthe termination value. In this case, termination is temporarily disabled.\nWhen termination occurs, the STAT pin goes HIGH.\nThe top-off timer is reset at one of the following conditions:\n1.Charge disable to enable\n2.Charger enters termination\n9.3.7.4 Thermistor Qualification\nThe device provides a single thermistor input for battery temperature monitoring.\n9.3.7.4.1 JEITA Guideline Compliance During Charging Mode (BQ25616J)\nTo improve the safety of charging Li-ion batteries, the JEITA guideline was released on April 20, 2007. The \nguideline emphasized the importance of avoiding a high charge current and high charge voltage at certain low \nand high temperature ranges.\nTo initiate a charge cycle, the voltage on TS pin, as a percentage of V REGN , must be within the V T1_FALL%  to \nVT5_RISE%  thresholds. If the TS voltage percentage exceeds the T1-T5 range, the controller suspends charging, \na TS fault is reported and waits until the battery temperature is within the T1-T5 range.\nAt cool temperature (T1-T2), JEITA recommends the charge current to be reduced to 20% of I CHG. At warm \ntemperature (T3-T5), JEITA recommends charge voltage less than 4.1 V.BQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\nCharging Current\n10 25 40T3 T5\nBattery Thermistor Temperature (°C)05 15 20 30 35 45 50 60T1 T2JEITA_WARM_ISET\n100% of I CHG \nJEITA_COOL_ISET\n20% of I CHG \nCharging VoltageJEITA_WARM_VSET\n4.1VJEITA_COOL_VSET\nVREGFigure 9-6.

Hot/Cold Profile (BQ25616) \n9.3.7.4.3 Boost Mode Thermistor Monitor During Battery Discharge Mode\nFor battery protection during Boost mode, the device monitors battery temperature to be within the V BCOLD  and \nVBHOT thresholds. When RT1 is 5.3 k Ω and RT2 is 31.14 k Ω, TBCOLD  default is -19.5°C and T BHOT default is \n64°C. When the temperature is outside of the temperature thresholds, Boost mode is suspended.\n9.3.7.5 Charging Safety Timer\nThe device has a built-in safety timer to prevent an extended charging cycle due to abnormal battery conditions. \nThe safety timer is 2 hours when the battery is below the V BATLOWV  threshold and 10 hours when the battery is \nhigher than the V BATLOWV  threshold. When the safety timer expires, the STAT pin is blinking at 1 Hz to report a \nsafety timer expiration fault.\nDuring IINDPM/VINDPM regulation, or thermal regulation, the safety timer counts at a half clock rate, because \nthe actual charge current is likely below the setting. For example, if the charger is in input current regulation \nthroughout the whole charging cycle, and the safety time is set to 10 hours, the safety timer will expire in 20 \nhours.\nDuring faults of BAT_FAULT, NTC_FAULT that lead to charging suspend, the safety timer is suspended as well. \nOnce the fault goes away, the timer resumes. If the user stops the current charging cycle, and starts it again, the \ntimer gets reset (toggle of CE pin).\n9.3.8 Status Outputs ( PG, STAT)\n9.3.8.1 Power Good Indicator ( PG Pin)\nThe PG pin goes  LOW  to indicate a good input source when:\n•VVBUS above V VBUS_UVLO\n•VVBUS above battery (not in sleep)BQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\n•VVBUS below V ACOV  threshold\n•VVBUS above V POORSRC  (typical 3.8 V) when I BADSRC  (typical 30 mA) current is applied (not a poor source)\n•Completed Section 9.3.3.4\n9.3.8.2 Charging Status Indicator (STAT)\nThe device indicates the charging state on the open drain STAT pin.

The maximum input current is set by a resistor from ILIM pin to ground as:\nIINDPM  =KILIM\nRILIM\n(5)\n9.3.9.2 Voltage and Current Monitoring in Buck Mode\n9.3.9.2.1 Input Overvoltage Protection (ACOV)\nThis device integrates the functionality of an overvoltage protector. The device can be paired with an external \nN-channel FET to block input voltages in excess of the VBUS rating. For correct operation, connect the cathode \nof the body diode to the VAC node. Back-to-back body diodes between VAC and VBUS are not recommended \nand will prevent correct operation.  The input voltage is sensed via the VAC pin and the ACDRV pin is used \nto control the external FET gate for protection . The default OVP threshold is 14.2 V. The ACOV circuit has \na reaction time of 130 ns (typical) to turn off the external ACFET. Note that turning off the external ACFET \ntakes longer and depends on its gate capacitance. In addition to turning off the external ACFET, an  ACOV \nevent immediately stops converter switching whether in buck or Boost mode. The device automatically resumes \nnormal operation once the input voltage drops back below the OVP threshold. During ACOV, REGN LDO is on, \nand the device does not enter HIZ mode.\n9.3.9.2.2 System Overvoltage Protection (SYSOVP)\nThe charger device clamps the system voltage during a load transient so that the components connected to the \nsystem are not damaged due to high voltage. The V SYS_OVP  threshold is about 300 mV above battery regulation \nvoltage when battery charging is terminated. Upon SYSOVP, the converter stops switching immediately to clamp \nthe overshoot. The charger pulls 30-mA I SYS_LOAD  discharge current to bring down the system voltage.\n9.3.9.3 Voltage and Current Monitoring in Boost Mode\n9.3.9.3.1 Boost Mode Overvoltage Protection\nWhen PMID voltage rises above the regulation target and exceeds V BST_OVP , the device stops switching \nimmediately and the device exits Boost mode after the Boost mode OVP lasts for 12 ms. Meanwhile, if VAC \n(and VBUS when shorted to VAC) voltage exceeds V ACOV , the device exits Boost mode as well .\n9.3.9.4 Thermal Regulation and Thermal Shutdown\n9.3.9.4.1 Thermal Protection in Buck Mode\nBesides the battery temperature monitor on the TS pin, the device monitors the internal junction temperature \nTJ to avoid overheating the chip and limits the IC junction temperature in buck mode. When the internal \njunction temperature exceeds the thermal regulation limit (110°C), the device lowers down the charge current. www.ti.comBQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\nDuring thermal regulation, the actual charging current is usually below the programmed battery charging current. \nTherefore, termination is disabled, the safety timer runs at half the clock rate.\nAdditionally, the device has thermal shutdown to turn off the converter and the BATFET when the IC surface \ntemperature exceeds T SHUT 150°C. The BATFET and converter are enabled to recover when IC temperature is \n130°C.\n9.3.9.4.2 Thermal Protection in Boost Mode\nBesides the battery temperature monitor on the TS pin, the device monitors the internal junction temperature to \nprovide thermal shutdown during Boost mode. When the IC junction temperature exceeds T SHUT 150°C, Boost \nmode is disabled . When the IC junction temperature is below 145°C, the host can re-enable Boost mode.\n9.3.9.5 Battery Protection\n9.3.9.5.1 Battery Overvoltage Protection (BATOVP)\nThe battery overvoltage limit is clamped at 4% above battery regulation voltage. When battery overvoltage \noccurs, the charger device immediately stops switching.\n9.3.9.5.2 Battery Overdischarge Protection\nWhen the battery is discharged below V BAT_DPL_FALL , the BATFET latches off to protect the battery from \noverdischarge. To recover from overdischarge latch-off, an input source plug-in is required at VAC/VBUS.\n9.3.9.5.3 System Overcurrent Protection\nWhen the system is shorted or significantly overloaded (I BAT > I BATOP ) and the current exceeds BATFET \novercurrent limit, the BATFET latched off. The BATFET latch can be reset with VBUS plug-in.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe BQ25616/616J is a standalone device and therefore does not have I2C functions.BQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

Usually \ninductor ripple is designed in the range between 20% and 40% maximum charging current as a trade-off \nbetween inductor size and efficiency for a practical design.\n10.2.1.2.2 Input Capacitor and Resistor\nDesign input capacitance to provide enough ripple current rating to absorb input switching ripple current. The \nworst case RMS ripple current is half of the charging current when duty cycle is 0.5. If the converter does not \noperate at 50% duty cycle, then the worst case capacitor RMS current I CIN occurs where the duty cycle is closest \nto 50% and can be estimated using Equation 8 .\nCIN CHGI I D (1 D)/c61 /c180 /c180 /c45\n(8)\nLow ESR ceramic capacitor such as X7R or X5R is preferred for input decoupling capacitor and should be \nplaced to the drain of the high-side MOSFET and source of the low-side MOSFET as close as possible. Voltage \nrating of the capacitor must be higher than normal input voltage level. A rating of 25-V or higher capacitor is \npreferred for 12-V input voltage. Capacitance of minimum 10 μF is suggested for typical of 3-A charging current.\nDuring high current output over 700 mA in boost mode, a 10 k Ω pull-down resistor on VBUS is recommended to \nkeep VBUS low in case Q1 RBFET leakage gets high.\n10.2.1.2.3 Output Capacitor\nEnsure that the output capacitance has enough ripple current rating to absorb the output switching ripple current. \nEquation 9  shows the output capacitor RMS current I COUT  calculation.\nRIPPLE\nCOUT RIPPLEII 0.29 I\n2 3/c61 /c187 /c180\n/c180\n(9)\nThe output capacitor voltage ripple can be calculated as follows:BQ25616, BQ25616J\nSLUSDF7A – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25616  BQ25616J\nOUT OUT\nO 2INV VV 1V 8LCfs/c230 /c246/c68 /c61 /c45 /c231 /c247\n/c232 /c248(10)\nAt certain input and output voltage and switching frequency, the voltage ripple can be reduced by increasing the \noutput filter LC.\nThe charger device has internal loop compensation optimized for >10- μF ceramic output capacitance.

Proper layout of \nthe components to minimize the high frequency current path loop (see Figure 12-1 ) is important to prevent \nelectrical and magnetic field radiation and high frequency resonant problems. Follow this specific order carefully \nto achieve the proper layout.\n1.Place an input capacitor as close as possible to the PMID pin and GND pin connections and use the shortest \ncopper trace connection or GND plane. Add a 1-nF small size (such as 0402 or 0201) decoupling cap for the \nhigh frequency noise filter and EMI improvement.\n2.Place the inductor input pin as close as possible to SW pin. Minimize the copper area of this trace to lower \nelectrical and magnetic field radiation but make the trace wide enough to carry the charging current. Do not \nuse multiple layers in parallel for this connection. Minimize parasitic capacitance from this area to any other \ntrace or plane.\n3.Put the output capacitor near to the inductor and the device. Ground connections need to be tied to the IC \nground with a short copper trace connection or GND plane.\n4.Route the analog ground separately from power ground. Connect the analog ground and connect power \nground separately. Connect the analog ground and power ground together using the thermal pad as the \nsingle ground connection point. Or use a 0-Ω resistor to tie the analog ground to power ground.\n5.Use a single ground connection to tie the charger power ground to the charger analog ground just beneath \nthe device. Use ground copper pour but avoid power pins to reduce inductive and capacitive noise coupling.\n6.Place the decoupling capacitors next to the IC pins and make the trace connection as short as possible.\n7.It is critical that the exposed thermal pad on the backside of the device package be soldered to the PCB \nground. Ensure that there are sufficient thermal vias directly under the IC, connecting to the ground plane on \nthe other layers.\n8.Ensure that the number and sizes of vias allow enough copper for a given current path.\nSee the BQ25618 BMS024 Evaluation Module User\'s Guide  and BQ25619 BMS025 Evaluation Module \nEVM User\'s Guide  for the recommended component placement with trace and via locations.
