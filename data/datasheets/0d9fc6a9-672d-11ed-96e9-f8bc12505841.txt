The output current can be adjusted above, or below the set \nvalue, by applying an external control signal to the \'ADJ\' pi n.  \n \nEnhanced output current dimming resolution can be achieved by \napplying a PWM signal to the ‘ADJ’ pin.  \n \nSoft-start can be forced using an external capacitor from the ADJ \npin to ground.  Applying a voltage of 0.2V or lower to the ADJ pin \nturns the outpu t off and switches the device into a low current \nstandby state.  \n  Pin Assignments  \n \n \n \n \nV-DFN3030 -6 \n \n \nTypical Application Circuit  \n \n Features  \n\uf0b7 Typically Better than 0.8% Output Current  Accuracy  \n\uf0b7 Simple and with Low Part Count \n\uf0b7 Single Pin On/Off and Brightness Control Using DC Voltage or \nPWM  \n\uf0b7 PWM Resolution up to 1000:1  \n\uf0b7 High Efficiency (up to 97%)  \n\uf0b7 Switching Frequencies up to 1MHz  \n\uf0b7 Wide Input Voltage Range: 6V to 60V  \n\uf0b7 Inherent Open-Circuit LED Protection  \n\uf0b7 Available in Thermally Enhanced Green Molding Packages  \n- SO-8EP                θ JA = +45°C/W  \n- V-DFN3030 -6      θ JA = +44°C/W  \n- TSOT25                θ JA = +82°C/W  \n\uf0b7 Totally Lead -free & Fully RoHS Compliant (Notes 1 & 2)  \n\uf0b7 Halogen and Antimony Free. “Green Device (Note 3)      \n\uf0b7 Qualified to AEC -Q100 Grade 1  \n\uf0b7 An Automotive Compliant part is available under a separate \ndatasheet ( ZXLD1366Q ) \n \nApplications  \n\uf0b7 Low Voltage Industrial Lighting  \n\uf0b7 LED Back-Up Lighting  \n\uf0b7 Illuminated Signs \n\uf0b7 Emergency Lighting  \n\uf0b7 SELV Lighting  \n\uf0b7 Refrigeration Lights   \n \nNotes:  1.

Theoretical Operating Waveforms  \n \nOperation can be best understood by assuming that the ADJ pin of the device is unconnected and the voltage on this pin (V ADJ) appears \ndirectly at the (+) input of the comparator.  \n \nWhen input voltage V IN is first applied, the initial current in L1 and R S is zero and there is no output from the current sense circuit. Under this \ncondit ion, the ( -) input to the comparator is at ground and its output is high. This turns MN on and switches the LX pin low, causing current to \nflow from V IN to ground, via R S, L1 and the LED(s). The current rises at a rate determined by V IN and L1 to produce a  voltage ramp (V SENSE ) \nacross R S. The supply referred voltage V SENSE  is forced across internal resistor R1 by the current sense circuit and produces a proportional \ncurrent in internal resistors R2 and R3. This produces a ground referred rising voltage at t he (-) input of the comparator. When this reaches the \nthreshold voltage (V ADJ), the comparator output switches low and MN turns off. The comparator output also drives another NMOS switch, \nwhich bypasses internal resistor R3 to provide a controlled amount of hysteresis.  The hysteresis is set by R3 to be nominally 15% of V ADJ.  \n \nWhen MN is off, the current in L1 continues to flow via D1 and the LED(s) back to V IN. The current decays at a rate determined by the LED(s) \nand diode forward voltages to produce a falling voltage at the input of the comparator. When this voltage returns to V ADJ, the comparator \noutput switches to high again. This cycle of  events repeats, with the comparator input ramping between limits of V ADJ ± 15%.  \n \nSwitching Thresholds  \nWith V ADJ = VREF, the ratios of R1, R2 and R3 define an average V SENSE  switching threshold of 200mV (measured on the I SENSE  pin with \nrespect to V IN). The average output current I OUTnom  is then defined by this voltage and R S according to:  \n \nIOUTnom  = 200mV/R S \n \nNominal  ripple current is ±30mV/R S \n \n  \n0V\nVIN\n200mV 230mV\n0VSENSEvoltage\nVSENSE+VSENSE-Toff Ton\n170mV\n0V5VVIN\n0.15VADJ\n0.15VADJIOUTnomIOUTnom+15%\nIOUTnom-15%\nVADJLXvoltage\nCoilcurrent\nComparator\ninputvoltage\nComparator\noutput\n  \n \nZXLD1366   \nDocument number: DS 31992  Rev. 9 - 2 7 of 31 \nwww.diodes.com   April 2016  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n ZXLD1366  \n \n \nDevice Description (cont inued ) \nActual operating waveforms  \nVIN = 15V, R S = 0.2 Ω, L = 68µH  Normal operation.  \nOutput Current (Ch 3) and LX voltage (Ch 2)  \n VIN = 30V, R S = 0.2 Ω, L = 68µH Normal operation.  \nOutput Current (Ch 3) and LX voltage (Ch 2)  \n \nVIN = 60V, R S = 0.2 Ω, L = 68µH Normal operation.  \nOutput Current (Ch 3) and LX voltage (Ch 2) \n  \n \nAdjusting Output Current  \nThe device contains a low pass filter between the ADJ pin and the threshold comparator and an internal current limiting resis tor (50kΩ nom) \nbetween ADJ and the internal reference voltage.  This allows the ADJ pin to be overdriven with either DC  or pulse signals to change the \nVSENSE  switching threshold and adjust the output current.  \n  \nDetails of the different modes of adjusting output current are given in the applications section.  \n \nOutput Shutdown  \nThe output of the low pass filter drives the shutdown circuit. When the input voltage to this circuit falls below the thresho ld (0.2V nom.), the \ninternal regulator and the output switch are turned off. The voltage reference remains powered during s hutdown to provide the bias current \nfor the shutdown circuit. Quiescent supply current during shutdown is nominally 60μA and switch leakage is below 5μA.  \n \n  \n\n  \n \nZXLD1366   \nDocument number: DS 31992  Rev. 9 - 2 8 of 31 \nwww.diodes.com   April 2016  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n ZXLD1366  \n \n \nTypical Operating Conditions  \n \n \n \n \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nSUPPLY VOLTAGE (V)\nOutput Current, L = 68µH1.100\n1.080\n1.060\n1.040\n1.020\n1.000\n0.980OUTPUT CURRENT (A)1 LED\n3 LEDs\n5 LEDs\n7 LEDs\n9 LEDs\n11 LEDs\n13 LEDs\n15 LEDs\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nSUPPLY VOLTAGE (V)\nOutput Current Deviation, L = 68µH1 LED\n3 LEDs\n5 LEDs\n7 LEDs\n9 LEDs\n11 LEDs\n13 LEDs\n15 LEDs10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2OUTPUT CURRENT DEVIATION (%)\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-10\n1 LED\n3 LEDs\n5 LEDs\n7 LEDs\n9 LEDs\n11 LEDs\n13 LEDs\n15 LEDs\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nSUPPLY VOLTAGE (V)\nEfficiency, L = 68µH100\n95\n90\n85\n80\n75\n70EFFICIENCY (%)\n65\n60\n55\n50\n  \n \nZXLD1366   \nDocument number: DS 31992  Rev. 9 -

This capacitor has to supply the relatively high peak current to the coil and smooth the current r ipple on the input \nsupply.  \n \nTo avoid transients into the IC, the size of the input capacitor will depend on the V IN voltage:  \n \nVIN = 6 to 40V C IN = 2.2μF  \n \nVIN = 40 to 50V C IN = 4.7μF  \n \nVIN = 50 to 60V C IN = 10μF  \n \nWhen the input voltage is close to the output voltage , the input current increases , which puts more demand on the input capacitor. The \nminimum value of 2.2μF ma y need to be increased to 4.7μF; higher values will improve performance at lower input voltages, especially when \nthe source impedance is high. The input capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the IC.  \n \nFor maximum stability over temperature and voltage, capacitors with X7R, X5R, or better dielectric is recommended. Capacitors with Y5V \ndielectric are not suitable for decoupling in this application and should NOT be used.  \n \nWhen higher voltages are used with the C IN = 10μF, an electrolytic capacitor  can be used provided that a suitable 1 µF ceramic capacitor is al so \nused and positioned as close  to the VIN pin as possible.  \n \nA suitable  capacitor  would  be NACEW100M1006.3x8TR13F (NIC Components).  \n \nThe following web sites are useful when looking for alternatives:  \n \nwww.murata.com  \nwww.niccomp.com  \nwww.kemet.com  \n \nInductor Selection  \n \nRecommended inductor values for the ZXLD1366 are within  the range  of 68μH to 220μH.  \n \nHigher values of inductance are recommended at higher supply voltages in order to minimize errors due to switching delays, which result in \nincreased ripple and lower efficiency. Higher values of inductance also result in a smaller change in output current over the  supply voltage \nrange. ( See graphs pages 10 -17). The inductor should b e mounted as close to the device as possible with low resistance connections to the LX \nand VIN pins.  \n \nThe chosen coil should have a saturation current higher than the peak output current and a continuous current rating above th e required mean \noutput curren t. \n \nSuitable coils for use with the ZXLD1366 may be selected from the MSS range manufactured by Coilcraft, or the NPIS range manu factured by \nNIC components.

It is very important to consider the reverse leakage of the diode when operating above +85°C. Excess leakage will increase \nthe power dissipation in the device and if close to the load may create a thermal runaway condition.  \n \nThe higher forward voltage and overshoot due to reverse recovery time in silicon diodes will increase the peak voltage on the  LX output. If a \nsilicon diode is used,  care should be taken to ensure that the total voltage appearing on the LX pin including supply ripple, does not exceed the \nspecified maximum value.  \n \n*A suitable Schottky diode would be B3100 (Diodes Inc .) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60123456789101112131415\nLegend\n47µH\n68µH\n100µH\n150µH\n47µH68µH100µH150µHT  < 70°C, I  = 1A C LEDNumber of LEDs\nSupply Voltage (V)\n  \n \nZXLD1366   \nDocument number: DS 31992  Rev. 9 - 2 24 of 31 \nwww.diodes.com   April 2016  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n ZXLD1366  \n \n \nApplication Information (cont.) \n \nReducing Output Ripple  \nPeak to peak ripple current in the LED(s) can be reduced, if required, by shunting a capacitor Cled across the LED(s) as show n below:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure  6.

Proportionally , lower ripple can be  achieved with \nhigher capacitor values. Note that the capacitor will not affect operating frequency or efficiency, but it will increase start-up delay, by reducing \nthe rate of rise of LED voltage.  \n \nBy adding this capacitor , the current waveform through the LED(s) changes from a triangular ramp to a more sinusoidal version without \naltering the mean current value . \n \nOperation at Low Supply Voltage  \nBelow the under voltage lockout threshold (V SD), the drive to the output transistor is turned off to prevent device operation with excessive on -\nresistance of the output transistor. The output transistor is not full y enhanced until the supply voltage  exceeds approximately 17V. At supply \nvoltages between V SD and 17V , care must be taken to avoid excessive power dissipation due to the on -resistance.  \n \nNote that when driving loads of two or more LEDs, the forward drop will normally be sufficient to prevent  the device from switching below \napproximately 6V  - This will minimi ze the risk of damage to the device.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nVINVIN\nISENSE LX\nZXLD1366Rs\nL1CledLEDD1\n  \n \nZXLD1366   \nDocument number: DS 31992  Rev. 9 - 2 25 of 31 \nwww.diodes.com   April 2016  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n ZXLD1366  \n \n \nApplication Information (cont.) \nThermal Considerations  \nWhen operating the device at high ambient temperatures, or when driving maximum load current, care must be taken to avoid exc eeding the \npackage power dissipation limits. The graph below gives details for power derating. This assumes the device to be mounte d on a 25mm2 \nPCB with 1oz copper standing in still air.  \n \n \n \n \nNote that the device power dissipation will most often be a maximum at minimum supply voltage. It will  also increase if the efficiency of the \ncircuit is low. This may result from the use of unsuitable coils, or  excessive parasitic output capacitance on the switch output.  \n \nIn order to maximize the thermal capabilities of the DFN3030 -6 and the SO -8EP packages , thermal vias should be incorporated into the \nPCB. See figures 7 and 8 for examples us ed in the ZXLD1366 evaluation boards.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7 .

Suggested Layout for SO -8EP Package  \n \nVias ensure an effective path to the ground plane for the heat flow , therefore reducing the thermal impedance between junction and ambient \ntemperature s. Diodes  Inc. came to the conclusion that the compromi se is reached by using more than 10 vias with 1mm of d iameter and a 0.5 \nhole size.  \n \nFinally , the same scheme in Figure 7 (without the exposed paddle) can be used  for the TSOT25  package , guaranteeing an effective thermal \npath.  \n \nThermal Compensation of Output Current  \nHigh luminance LEDs often need to be supplied with a temperature compensated current in order to  maintain stable and reliable operation at \nall drive levels. The LEDs are usually mounted remotely from  the device so, for this reason, the temperature coefficients of the internal circuits \nfor the  ZXLD1366 are optimized to minimize the change in output current when no compensation is employed. If output  current compensation \nis required , it is possible to use an extern al temperature sensing network normally , using Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistors \nand/or diodes, mounted very close  to the LED(s). The output of the sensing network can be used to drive the ADJ pin in order to reduce  output \ncurrent with increasing temperature.  \n \nLayout Considerations  \n \nLX Pin \nThe LX pin of the device is a fast -switching node, so PCB tracks should be kept as short as possible. To  minimize ground \'bounce\', the ground \npin of the device should be soldered directly to the ground plane.  \n \nCoil and Decoupling Capacitors and Current Sense Resistor  \nIt is particularly important to mount the coil and the input decoupling capacitor as close to the device pins  as possible to minimize parasitic \nresistance and inductance, which will degrade efficiency. It is also  import ant to minimize any track resistance in series with current sense \nresistor R S. It’s best to connect  VIN directly to one end of R S and I SENSE  directly to the opposite end of R S with no other currents flowing  in these \ntracks. It is important that the cathode current of the Schottky diode does not flow in a track between R S and V IN as this may give an apparent \nhigher measure of current than it actual ly is because of track resistance.  \n \nADJ Pin \nThe ADJ pin is a high -impedance input for voltages up to 1.35V , so, when left floating, PCB tracks to this  pin should be as short as possible to \nreduce noise pickup. A 100nF capacitor from the ADJ pin to ground  will reduce frequency modulation of the output under these conditions. An \nadditional series 3.3kΩ  resistor can also be used when driving the ADJ pin from an external circuit (see next page ). This resistor will  provide \nfiltering for low -frequency noise and provide protection against high -voltag e transients.  \n \n  \n\n  \n \nZXLD1366   \nDocument number: DS 31992  Rev. 9 - 2 27 of 31 \nwww.diodes.com   April 2016  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n ZXLD1366  \n \n \nApplication Information (cont.) \n \n \n \n \n \nHigh -Voltage Tracks  \nAvoid running any high -voltage tracks close to the ADJ pin  to reduce the risk of leakage currents due to  board contamination. The ADJ pin is \nsoft-clamped for voltages above 1.35V to desensitize it to leakage  that might raise the ADJ pin voltage and cause excessive output current. \nHowever, a ground ring placed  around the ADJ pin is recommended to minimize changes in output current under these conditions.  \n \nEvaluation PCB  \nZXLD1366 evaluation boards are available upon  request. Terminals allow users to interface the boards to their preferred LED products.  \n \nDimming Output Current Using PWM  \n \nLow Frequency PWM Mode \nWhen the ADJ pin is driven with a low -frequency PWM signal ( e.g. 100Hz), with a high -level voltage V ADJ and a low level of zero, the output of \nthe internal low -pass filter will swing between 0V and V ADJ, causing  the input to the shutdown circuit to fall below its turn -off threshold (200mV \nnom) when the ADJ pin is low.  This will cause the  output current to be switched on and off at the PWM frequency, resulting in an  average \noutput current I OUTavg  proportional to the PWM duty cycle.  \n(See Figure 9 - Low frequency  PWM operating waveforms).  \n \nThe average value of output current in this mode is  given by:  \n \nIOUTavg  0.2D PWM/RS [for D PWM >0.001]  \nThis mode is preferable if optimum LED \'whiteness\' is required. It will also provide the widest possible  dimming range (approx. 1000:1) and \nhigher efficiency at the expense of greater output ripple.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9 .
