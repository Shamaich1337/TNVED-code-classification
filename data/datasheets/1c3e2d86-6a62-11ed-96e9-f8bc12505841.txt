Return \nthe feedback divider (R FB) to this net.\nVIN (Bank 4): The V IN pin supplies current to the LTM8045’s \ninternal regulator and to the internal power switch. This \npin must be locally bypassed with an external, low ESR \ncapacitor.FB (Pin A3):  If configured as a SEPIC, the LTM8045 \nregulates \nits FB pin to 1.215V. Apply a resistor between \nFB and V OUT+. Its value should be R FB = [(V OUT – 1.215)/ \n0.0833]kΩ. If  the LTM8045 is configured as an inverting \nconverter, the LTM8045 regulates the FB pin to 5mV. Apply  \na resistor between FB and V OUT– of value R FB = [(|V OUT| \n+ 0.005)/0.0833]kΩ. SYNC (Pin E1): To synchronize the switching frequency \nto an outside clock, simply drive this pin with a clock. The \nhigh voltage level of the clock needs to exceed 1.3V, and \nthe low level should be less than 0.4V. Drive this pin to \nless than 0.4V to revert to the internal free running clock. \nGround this pin if the SYNC function is not used. See the \nApplications Information section for more information. \nSS (Pin F1): Place a soft-start capacitor here. Upon start- up, \nthe SS pin will be charged by a (nominally) 275k resistor \nto about 2.2V.RT (Pin G1): The RT pin is used to program the switching \nfrequency of the LTM8045 by connecting a resistor from \nthis pin to ground. The necessary resistor value for the \nLTM8045 is determined by the equation R\nT = (91.9/f OSC) – 1,  \nwhere f OSC is the typical switching frequency in MHz and \nRT is in kΩ. Do not leave this pin open.\nRUN (Pin G3): This pin is used to enable/disable the chip \nand restart the soft-start sequence. Drive below 1.235V \nto disable the chip. Drive above 1.385V to activate chip \nand restart the soft-start sequence. Do not float this pin.\nLTM804510\n8045fc\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8045block Diagra M\nCURRENT\nMODE\nCONTROLLER1µFVIN VOUT–\nVOUT+\nRUN\nSS\nSYNC\nGND\n8045 BD0.1µF\n••\n2µF10µH 10µH\nRTFB\nLTM804511\n8045fc\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8045opera Tion\nThe LTM8045 is a stand-alone switching DC/DC converter \nthat may be configured either as a SEPIC (single-ended \nprimary inductance converter) or inverting power supply \nsimply by tying V OUT– or V OUT+ to GND, respectively. \nIt accepts an input voltage up to 18VDC. The output is \nadjustable between 2.5V and 15V for the SEPIC, and \nbetween –2.5V and –15V for the inverting configuration. \nThe LTM8045 can provide 700mA at V IN = 12V when V OUT \n= 2.5V or –2.5V.\nAs shown in the Block Diagram, the LTM8045 contains a \ncurrent mode controller, power switching element, power \ncoupled inductor, power Schottky diode and a modest \namount of input and output capacitance. The LTM8045 \nis a fixed frequency PWM  converter.  \nThe LTM8045 switching can free run by applying a resis -\ntor to  the RT pin or synchronize to an external source at \na frequency between 200kHz and 2MHz. To synchronize to an external source, drive a valid signal source into the \nSYNC pin. An R T resistor is required whether or not a \nSYNC signal is applied. See the Applications Information \nsection for more details.\nThe LTM8045 also features RUN and SS pins to control \nthe start-up  behavior  of the device. The RUN pin may also \nbe \nused to implement an accurate undervoltage lockout \nfunction by applying just one or two resistors.The LTM8045 is equipped with a thermal shutdown to \nprotect the device during momentary overload conditions. \nIt is set above the 125°C absolute maximum internal tem -\nperature rating \n to avoid interfering with normal specified \noperation, so internal device temperatures will exceed \nthe absolute maximum rating when the overtemperature \nprotection is active. Therefore, continuous or repeated activation of the thermal shutdown may impair device \nreliability. \nLTM804512\n8045fc\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8045applica Tions inForMaTion\nFor most applications, the design process is straight \nforward, summarized as follows:\n1.

R FB is determined \nfrom the equation R FB = [(V OUT – 1.215)/0.0833]kΩ for \na SEPIC and from R FB = [(|V OUT| + 0.005)/0.0833]kΩ for \nan inverting converter.\nCapacitor Selection Considerations\nThe C IN and C OUT capacitor values in Table 1 are the \nminimum recommended values for the associated oper-\nating conditions . Applying capacitor values below those \nindicated in Table 1 is not recommended, and may result \nin undesirable operation. Using larger values is generally \nacceptable, and can yield improved dynamic response, if \nit is necessary. Again, it is incumbent upon the user to \nverify proper operation over the intended system’s line, load and environmental conditions.\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However, not all ceramic capacitors are suitable. \nX5R and X7R types are stable over temperature and ap -\nplied voltage  \n and give dependable service. Other types, \nincluding Y5V and Z5U have very large temperature and \nvoltage coefficients of capacitance. In an application cir -\ncuit they may have only a small fraction of their nominal \ncapacitance \nresulting in much higher output voltage ripple \nthan expected.A final precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns \nthe maximum input voltage rating of the LTM8045. A \nceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable \ninductance forms a high Q (under damped) tank circuit. \nIf the LTM8045 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the \ninput voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, possi -\nbly exceeding \n the device’s rating. This situation is easily \navoided; see the Hot-Plugging Safely section.\nProgramming Switching Frequency\nThe LTM8045 has an operational switching frequency range  \nbetween 200kHz and 2MHz. The free running frequency is \nprogrammed with an external resistor from the RT pin to \nground. Do not leave this pin open under any circumstance. When the SYNC pin is driven low (< 0.4V), the frequency \nof operation is set by the resistor from RT to ground. The \nRT value is calculated by the following equation:\n  RT=91.9\nfOSC−1\nwhere f OSC is the typical switching frequency in MHz and \nRT is in kΩ.\nSwitching Frequency T rade-OffsIt is recommended that the user apply the optimal R\nT value \ngiven in Table 1 for the corresponding input and output \noperating condition. System level or other considerations, \nhowever, may necessitate another operating frequency. \nWhile the LTM8045 is flexible enough to accommodate a \nwide range of operating frequencies, a haphazardly chosen  \none may result in undesirable operation under certain op -\nerating or  fault conditions. A frequency that is too high can \nreduce \nefficiency, generate excessive heat or even damage \nthe LTM8045 in some fault conditions. A frequency that \nis too low can result in a final design that has too much \noutput ripple or too large of an output capacitor.\nSwitching Frequency Synchronization\nThe switching frequency can be synchronized to an external  \nclock source. To synchronize to the external source, simply  \nprovide a digital clock signal at the SYNC pin. Switching \nwill occur at the SYNC clock frequency. Drive SYNC low \nand the switching frequency will revert to the internal \nfree-running oscillator after a few clock periods.  Switching will stop if SYNC is driven high.The duty cycle of SYNC must  be between 35% and 65% \nfor \nproper operation. Also, the frequency of the SYNC \nsignal must meet the following two criteria:1.\n SYNC \nmay not toggle outside the frequency range of \n200kHz to 2MHz unless it is stopped low to enable the \nfree-running oscillator.\n2. The \nSYNC frequency can always be higher than the \nfree-running oscillator frequency, f OSC, but should not \nbe less than 25% below f OSC (fOSC is set by R T).\nLTM804514\n8045fc\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8045applica Tions inForMaTion\nSoft-Start\nThe LTM8045 soft-start function controls the slew rate \nof the power supply output voltage during start-up. A \ncontrolled output voltage ramp minimizes output voltage overshoot, reduces inrush current from the V\nIN supply, \nand facilitates supply sequencing. A capacitor connected \nfrom the SS pin to GND programs the slew rate. In the \nevent of a commanded shutdown or lockout (RUN pin), internal undervoltage lockout or a thermal shutdown, the \nsoft-start capacitor is automatically discharged before charging resumes, thus assuring that the soft-start occurs \nwhen the LTM8045 restarts. The soft-start time is given \nby the equation:\n tSS = C SS/5.45, \nwhere C SS is in µF and t SS is in seconds.\nConfigurable Undervoltage Lockout\nFigure 1 shows how to configure an undervoltage lock -\nout (UVLO) for the LTM8045. Typically, UVLO is used in \nsituations where the input supply is current-limited, has \na relatively high source resistance, or ramps up/down \nslowly. A switching regulator draws constant power from \nthe source, so source current increases as source voltage \ndrops. This looks like a negative resistance load to the source and can cause the source to current-limit or latch \nlow under low source voltage  conditions . UVLO prevents \nthe \nregulator from operating at source voltages where \nthese problems might occur.The RUN pin has a voltage hysteresis with typical thresh -\nolds of  1.32 V (rising) and 1.29V (falling) and an internal \ncircuit that draws typically 11.6µA at the RUN threshold. \nThis makes R UVLO2  optional, allowing UVLO implemen-\ntation with a single resistor. Resistor R UVLO2  is optional. \nRUVLO2  can be included to reduce the overall UVLO voltage \nvariation caused by variations in the RUN pin current (see \nthe Electrical Characteristics section). A good choice for \nRUVLO2  is ≤10k ±1%. After choosing a value for R UVLO2 , \nRUVLO1  can be determined from either of the following:\n  RUVLO1 =VIN(RISING) −1.32V\n1.32V\nRUVLO2+11.6µA\nor\nRUVLO1 =VIN(FALLING) −1.29V\n1.29V\nRUVLO2+11.6µA\nwhere V IN(RISING)  and V IN(FALLING)  are the V IN threshold \nvoltages when rising or falling, respectively.\nFor example, to disable the LTM8045 for V IN voltages \nbelow 3.5V using the single resistor configuration, choose:\n  RUVLO1 =3.5V −1.29V\n1.29V\n∞+11.6µA=191k\nTo activate the LTM8045 for V IN voltage greater than 4.5V \nusing the two resistor configuration, choose R UVLO2  = \n10k and:\n  RUVLO1 =4.5V −1.32V\n1.32V\n10k+11.6µA=22.1k\nInternal Undervoltage LockoutThe LTM8045 monitors the V\nIN supply voltage in case V IN \ndrops below a minimum operating level (typically about \n2.3V). When V IN is detected low, the power switch is \ndeactivated, and while sufficient V IN voltage persists, the \nsoft-start capacitor is discharged. After V IN is detected high, \nthe LTM8045 will reactivate and the soft-start capacitor \nwill begin charging.L TM8045\nGNDVIN\nRUNRUVLO1\nRUVLO2VIN\n8045 F01\nFigure 1.

When  the part has cooled, the  part automati -\ncally restarts . This thermal shutdown is set to engage at \ntemperatures above the 125°C absolute maximum internal  \noperating rating to ensure that it does not interfere with \nfunctionality in the specified operating range. This means \nthat internal temperatures will exceed the 125°C absolute \nmaximum rating when the overtemperature protection is \nactive, possibly impairing the device’s reliability.\nPCB Layout\nMost of the headaches associated with PCB layout have \nbeen alleviated or even eliminated by the high level of \nintegration of the LTM8045. The LTM8045 is neverthe -\nless a  switching power supply, and care must be taken to \nminimize \nEMI and ensure proper operation. Even with the \nhigh level of integration, you may fail to achieve specified \noperation with a haphazard or poor layout. See Figure 2 \nfor the suggested layout of the inverting topology applica -\ntion and  Figure 3 for the suggested layout of the SEPIC \ntopology \napplication. Ensure that the grounding and heat \nsinking are acceptable.A few rules to keep in mind are:1.\n Place \nthe R FB and R T resistors as close as possible to \ntheir respective pins.\n2. Place \nthe C IN capacitor as close as possible to the V IN \nand GND connection of the LTM8045.\n3. Place \nthe Cout capacitor as close as possible to the  \nVOUT+ and V OUT– connections of the LTM8045.\n4. Place \nthe C IN and C OUT capacitors such that their \nground currents flow directly adjacent or underneath \nthe LTM8045.\n5. Connect \nall of the GND connections to as large a copper \npour or plane area as possible on the top layer. Avoid \nbreaking the ground connection between the external \ncomponents and the LTM8045.6. Use \nvias to connect the GND copper area to the board’s \ninternal ground planes. Liberally distribute these GND \nvias to provide both a good ground connection and \nthermal path to the internal planes of the printed circuit \nboard. Pay attention to the location and density of the \nthermal vias in Figures 2 and 3. The LTM8045 can \nbenefit from the heat sinking afforded by vias that con -\nnect to  internal GND planes at these locations, due to \ntheir \nproximity to internal power handling components. \nThe optimum number of thermal vias depends upon \nthe printed circuit board design . For example, a board \nmight \nuse very small via holes. It should employ more \nthermal vias than a board that uses larger holes.\nFigure 2.

However, these capaci -\ntors can  cause problems if the LTM8045 is plugged into a \nlive \ninput supply (see Application Note 88 for a complete \ndiscussion). The low loss ceramic capacitor combined with \nstray inductance in series with the power source forms an \nunderdamped tank circuit, and the voltage at the V IN pin \nof the LTM8045 can ring to more than twice the nominal \ninput voltage, possibly exceeding the LTM8045’s rating \nand damaging the part. If the input supply is poorly con -\ntrolled or  the user will be plugging the LTM8045 into an \nenergized \nsupply, the input network should be designed \nto prevent this overshoot. This can be accomplished by \ninstalling a small resistor in series with V IN, but the most \npopular method of controlling input voltage overshoot is \nto add an electrolytic bulk capacitor to the V IN net. This \ncapacitor’s relatively high equivalent series resistance damps the circuit and eliminates the voltage overshoot. \nThe extra capacitor improves low frequency ripple filter -\ning and  can slightly improve the efficiency of the circuit, \nthough it is physically large.\nThermal Considerations\nThe \nLTM8045 output current may need to be derated if \nit is required to operate in a high ambient temperature or \ndeliver a large amount of continuous power. The amount \nof current derating is dependent upon the input voltage, \noutput power and ambient temperature. The temperature \nrise curves given in the Typical Performance Character -\nistics section can be used as a guide. These curves were \ngenerated by a LTM8045 mounted to a 25.8cm2 4-layer \nFR4 printed circuit board with a copper thickness of 2oz \nfor the top and bottom layer and 1oz for the inner layers.  \nBoards of other sizes and layer count can exhibit differ -\nent thermal  behavior, so it is incumbent upon the user to \nverify \nproper operation over the intended system’s line, \nload and environmental operating conditions.The thermal resistance numbers listed in the Pin Configura -\ntion section  of the data sheet are based on modeling the \nµModule package mounted on a test board specified per \nJESD\n 51-9 (“Test Boards for Area Array Surface Mount \nPackage Thermal Measurements”). The thermal coefficients   \nprovided in  this page are based on JESD 51-12 (“Guide-\nlines \nfor Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal \nInformation”).\nFor increased accuracy and fidelity to the actual application, \nmany designers use FEA to predict thermal performance.  \nTo that end, the Pin Configuration section of the data sheet \ntypically gives four thermal coefficients:  •\n θJA – Thermal resistance from junction to ambient \n• θJCbottom  – Thermal resistance from junction to the \nbottom of the product case\n• θJCtop – Thermal resistance from junction to top of the \nproduct case\n• θJB – Thermal resistance from junction to the printed \ncircuit board. \nWhile the meaning of each of these coefficients may seem \nto be intuitive, JEDEC has defined each to avoid confusion \nand inconsistency. These definitions are given in JESD \n51-12, and are quoted or paraphrased below:•\n θJA is the natural convection junction-to-ambient air \nthermal resistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed \nenclosure. This environment is sometimes referred to as \n“still air” although natural convection causes the air to \nmove. This value is determined with the part mounted to \na JESD 51-9 defined test board, which does not reflect \nan actual application or viable operating condition.\n• θJCbottom  is the thermal resistance between the junction \nand bottom of the package with all of the component power dissipation flowing through the bottom  of the \npackage. \nIn the typical µModule converter, the bulk of \nthe heat flows out the bottom of the package, but there \nis always heat flow out into the ambient environment. \nAs a result, this thermal resistance value may be useful \nfor comparing packages but the test conditions don’t \ngenerally match the user’s application.\nLTM804517\n8045fc\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8045• θJCtop is determined with nearly all of the component \npower dissipation flowing through the top of the pack-\nage. As  the  electrical connections of the typical µ Module  \nconverter are on the bottom of the package, it is rare \nfor an application to operate such that most of the heat \nflows from the junction to the top of the part. As in the \ncase of θJCbottom , this value may be useful for comparing  \npackages but the test conditions don’t generally match \nthe user’s application.\n• θJB is the junction-to-board thermal resistance where \nalmost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the \nµModule converter and into the board, and is really \nthe sum of the θJCbottom  and the thermal resistance \nof the bottom of the part through the solder joints and \nthrough a portion of the board. The board temperature is \nmeasured a specified distance from the package, using \na two-sided, two layer board. This board is described \nin JESD 51-9.\nGiven these definitions, it should now be apparent that none  \nof these thermal coefficients reflects an actual physical \noperating condition of a µModule converter. Thus, none \nof them can be individually used to  accurately predict the applica Tions inForMaTion\nthermal performance of the product. Likewise, it would \nbe inappropriate to attempt to use any one coefficient to \ncorrelate to the junction temperature vs load graphs given in the product’s data sheet. The only appropriate way to \nuse the coefficients is when running a detailed thermal \nanalysis, such as FEA, which considers all of the thermal \nresistances simultaneously.\nA graphical representation of these thermal resistances \nis given in Figure 4.The blue resistances are contained within the µModule \nconverter, and the green are outside.The die temperature of the LTM8045 must be lower than \nthe maximum rating of 125°C, so care should be taken in \nthe layout of the circuit to ensure good heat sinking of the \nLTM8045. The bulk of the heat flow out of the LTM8045 \nis through the bottom of the μModule converter and the \nBGA pads into the printed circuit board. Consequently a \npoor printed circuit board design can cause excessive \nheating, resulting in impaired performance or reliability. \nPlease refer to the PCB Layout section for printed circuit \nboard design suggestions.\n8045 F04\nµMODULE DEVICEJUNCTION-TO-CASE (TOP)\nRESISTANCE\nJUNCTION-TO-BOARD RESISTANCEJUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT RESISTANCE (JESD 51-9 DEFINED BOARD)\nCASE (TOP)-TO-AMBIENT\nRESISTANCE\nBOARD-TO-AMBIENT\nRESISTANCEJUNCTION-TO-CASE\n(BOTTOM) RESISTANCEJUNCTION AMBIENT\nCASE (BOTTOM)-TO-BOARD\nRESISTANCE\nFigure 4.\nLTM804518\n8045fc\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8045Typical applica Tions\n–5V Inverting Converter with Added Output Filter Output Ripple and Noise\n500ns/DIV\nMEASURED PER AN70,\nUSING HP461A AMPLIFIER,150MHz BW200µV/DIV\n8045 TA03b4.7µFVIN\n12VDC••VIN VOUT–VOUT\n–5V580mA\nFB\n8045 TA03VOUT+RUNL TM8045\nSS\nRT\nSYNC\nGND60.4k\n22µF 10µF\n130kMPZ1608S601A\nFERRITE BEAD\n4.7µFVIN\n2.8VDC TO\n18VDC••VIN VOUT–VOUT\n–12V\nFB\n8045 TA04VOUT+RUNL TM8045\nSS\nRT\nSYNC\nGND143k\n10µF\n75.0k–12V Inverting ConverterMaximum Output Current vs Input Voltage \n–5V OUT Inverting Converter–5V Inverting Converter\n4.7µFVIN\n2.8VDC TO\n18VDC••VIN VOUT–VOUT\n–5V\nFB\n8045 TA02VOUT+RUNL TM8045\nSS\nRT\nSYNC\nGND60.4k\n22µF\n130k\nINPUT VOL TAGE (V)300500600\n400450650\n550\n350\n8045 TA02bOUTPUT CURRENT (mA)\n2 8 10 4 6 12 14 16 18\nLTM804519\n8045fc\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM8045package Descrip Tion\nTable 2.
