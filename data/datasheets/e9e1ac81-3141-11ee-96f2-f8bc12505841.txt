General description\nThe 74HC107; 74HCT107 is a dual negative edge triggered JK flip-flop featuring individual J and\nK inputs, clock ( CP) and reset ( R) inputs and complementary Q and Q outputs. The reset is an\nasynchronous active LOW input and operates independently of the clock input. The J and K inputs\ncontrol the state changes of the flip-flops as described in the mode select function table. The J and\nK inputs must be stable one set-up time prior to the HIGH-to-LOW clock transition for predictable\noperation. Inputs include clamp diodes that enable the use of current limiting resistors to interface\ninputs to voltages in excess of V CC.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range from 2.0 V to 6.0 V\n•CMOS low power dissipation\n•High noise immunity\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78 Class II Level B\n•Complies with JEDEC standards:\n•JESD8C (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•JESD7A (2.0 V to 6.0 V)\n•Input levels:\n•The 74HC107: CMOS levels\n•The 74HCT107: TTL levels\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM JESD22-A114F exceeds 2000 V\n•MM JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and from -40 °C to +125 °C\n3.

### Component Summary: 74HC107D,653

**General Description:**
The 74HC107 is a dual negative-edge triggered JK flip-flop with reset functionality. It features individual J and K inputs, a clock (CP) input, and an asynchronous reset (R) input. The flip-flop outputs are complementary (Q and Q̅). The reset input operates independently of the clock, allowing for flexible state control.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VCC): 2.0 V to 6.0 V
  - Absolute Maximum Supply Voltage: -0.5 V to +7.0 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Current (IO): ±25 mA
  - Input Clamping Current (IIK): ±20 mA
  - Supply Current (ICC): 50 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Total Power Dissipation (Ptot): 500 mW (derates above 100 °C)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Storage Temperature (Tstg): -65 °C to +150 °C
  - Operating Temperature: -40 °C to +125 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - SO14 (SOT108-1) - Plastic Small Outline Package
  - TSSOP14 (SOT402-1) - Plastic Thin Shrink Small Outline Package

- **Special Features:**
  - CMOS low power dissipation
  - High noise immunity
  - ESD protection: HBM > 2000 V, MM > 200 V
  - Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78 Class II Level B
  - Input levels: CMOS for 74HC107, TTL for 74HCT107

- **Moisture Sensitive Level:**
  - MSL Level: 1 (according to JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Description:**
The 74HC107 is a dual JK flip-flop designed for use in digital circuits where state storage and control are required. It allows for toggling, setting, and resetting of states based on the inputs provided. The negative-edge triggering ensures that state changes occur on the falling edge of the clock signal, making it suitable for synchronous applications.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Digital Logic Circuits:** Used in counters, registers, and state machines.
- **Data Storage:** For temporary storage of binary data.
- **Control Systems:** In applications requiring precise timing and state management.
- **Frequency Division:** Can be used in frequency dividers and clock generation circuits.

This component is ideal for applications in consumer electronics, telecommunications, and industrial control systems where reliable state management is crucial.
