In addition, the \ninternal compensation architecture can reduce the external \nRC compensation circuit, and the AP2905 does not need \nexternal resis tor divider to set output voltage, so it is very \neasy to use and layout on single layer PCB, just requires a \nminimum number of external components only.  \nThe specially circuit structure and optimized EMI \nperformance are particularly suitable for requiring safety \ncertification application.  \nFull protection features include OCP, OTP, SCP and UVLO.  \nThe AP2905 is available in a space saving 5 -pin SOT23 -5L \npackage.  \n   \nApplications  \n\uf06c MCU Control Systems and I/O Power  \n\uf06c Digital Set Top Boxes  \n\uf06c Flat Panel Television and M onitors  \n\uf06c Industrial Distributed Power Applications  \n\uf06c Portable Hand Held Instruments  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Features  \n\uf06c Wide Input Supply Voltage Range of 6V ~ 40 V  \n\uf06c Up to 0.7 A Output Continues Current, 1A Peak Output \nCurrent  \n\uf06c Up to 92% Efficiency  \n\uf06c 100 kHz Switching Frequency  \n\uf06c Optimized EMI Performance  \n\uf06c Internal Soft -start Circuitry  \n\uf06c Internal Compensation  \n\uf06c Easy to Layout on Single Layer PCB  \n\uf06c Input Under Voltage Lockout  \n\uf06c Cycle by Cycle Peak Current Limit  \n\uf06c Output Short Circuit Protection  \n\uf06c Thermal Shutdown  \n\uf06c Available in SOT23 -5L Package  \n \nTypical Application Efficiency   \n \n \n \n \nSimplified Application Circuit   \n \nAP2905SW VIN\nGNDEN VOUT1\n4 35\n2GND GNDCIN COUTL+5V VIN\n \n 0102030405060708090100\n0.01 0.1 1Efficiency(%)\nIout(A)VIN=12V\nVIN=18V\nVIN=24V\nVIN=36V\nAP290 5  Chipown  \n \n \nwww.chipown.com                                                                                   Wuxi Chipown Microelectronics Limited                                                              Rev. 2.5                      2/14  Typical Application Circuit  \n \nAP2905SW VIN\nGNDEC1\n100μF EN VOUT1\n4 35\n2GND GNDC1\n1μFC2\n1μFEC2\n100μFL1\n47μH +5V VIN\nOFFON\n \nOrdering Information  \nOrder Code  Package  Shipping  Top Marking  \nAP2905TB -A3 SOT23 -5L 3,000/Reel  VJXXX (1) \n(1).

Operation  \nAP2905 is a High Efficiency Synchronous DC -DC Buck \nConverter, which can output up to 0.7 A in a wide input range \nfrom 6 V to 40 V . The fixed 5 V output saves 2 voltage \ndivider resistors, and the layout is simpler.  AP2905 switching  \nfrequency  is 100 kHz.  \nWith the slope compensated current mode PWM control, \nprovides stable switching and cycle -by-cycle current limit \nfor excellent load and line responses and protection of the \ninternal switches. During normal operation, the internal main \nswitch is turned on fo r a certain time to ramp up the inductor \ncurrent at each rising edge of the internal oscillator, and \nturned off when the peak inductor current is above the error \nvoltage.  The current comparator limits the peak inductor \ncurrent. Once the main switch is tur ned off, the synchronous \nrectifier will be turned on immediately and stay on until \neither the inductor current decay to zero, as indicated by the \nzero current comparator or the beginning of the next clock \ncycle.  \n \n2. Cycle by Cycle Peak Current Limit  \nThe peak current limit prevents the AP2905  from high inductor \ncurrent and drawing excessive current from the input voltage \nrail. Excessive current might occur with a shorted or saturated \ninductor or a heavy load or a shorted output circuit condition. \nIf the inductor current reaches the peak limit threshold, the \nhigh-side MOSFET is turned off and the low -side MOSFET is \nturned on to ramp down the inductor current.  \n \n3. Dropout Operation  \nWhen the input voltage decreases toward the value of the \noutput voltage, t he AP2905  allows the main switch to remain \non for more than one switching cycle and increases the duty \ncycle(1) until it reaches 100%  (design supported  but cannot \nbe tested on system ). The output voltage then is the input \nvoltage minus the voltage drop across the main switch and \nthe inductor.  At low input supply voltage, the R DS(ON) of the \nP-Channel MOSFET increases, and the efficiency of the \nconverter decreases.  \n(1). The duty cycle D of a step -down converter is defined as:   \n D=TON×fSW×100% ≈VOUT\nVIN×100%                                   (1) \nWhere T ON is the main switch on time and f SW is the oscillator \nfrequency.  \n 4. Input Under -voltage Lockout ( UVLO)  \nAn input UVLO circuit prevents the converter from starting \nthe operation until the input voltage rises above the typical \nUVLO threshold of 5.5 V.  \n \n5. Enable PIN  \nThe AP2905 has an enable input EN for turning the IC on or \noff. The logic -high voltage can enable the IC , and the  logic -\nlow voltage disable s the IC , which enter s shutdown mode.  \nEN pin is pulled up to logic -high voltage  around 4.5 V with \nan internal constant current source about 50  μA, if keep this \npin floating, the chip works automatically. If pull down this \npin to GND with an external resistor, should ensure that its \nvalue  is less than  4.7 kΩ to guarantee a logic -low level \nvoltage.  \nEnsure  that the driving voltage  of EN pin  is less than  5 V, and \ncannot directly connect EN pin to VIN or pulled up  with a \nresistor to VIN.  \n \n6. Hiccup Mode Output Short Circuit Protection  \n(SCP) \nThere is a n output  UVP threshold. If the threshold is hit, the \nhiccup mode output SCP will be triggered by disabling the \nconverter and restarts soft -start after a predefined interval \nabout 0. 8 s. The AP2905  repeats this mode until the short   \ncircuit or over load condition is removed.   \n \n7. Soft-start  \nThe AP2905  implements the soft -start function to reduce the \ninrush current during startup. The soft -start begins once the \ninput voltage raises above typical UVLO threshold of 5.5 V. \nThe soft -start time is typically 2.5 ms. \n \n8. Thermal Shutdown  \nA thermal shutdown is implemented to prevent the damage \ndue to excessive heat and power dissipation. Typically, the \nthermal shutdown happens at the junction temperature of \n165 °C. When the thermal shutdown is triggered, the device \nstops switching until the junction temperature drops the \nhysteresis temperature lower than thermal shutdown \nthreshold, then the device starts switching again.  \nAP290 5  Chipown  \n \n \nwww.chipown.com                                                                                   Wuxi Chipown Microelectronics Limited                                                              Rev. 2.5                      7/14  Application Information  \n1.

Design Parameters  \n \n2. Inductor Selection  \nSince the selection of the inductor affects the power supply ’s \nsteady state operation, transient behavior, loop stability, and \noverall efficiency, the inductor is the most important \ncomponent in switch power regulator design. Three most \nimportant specifica tions to the performance of the inductor \nare the inductor value, DC resistance, and saturation current.  The AP2905  is designed to work with inductor values of      \n47 µH.  \nThe tolerance of inductors can be ranging from 10 % to 30 %. \nThe inductance will fu rther decrease 20 % to 35 % from the \nvalue of zero bias current depending on the definition of \nsaturation by inductor manufacturers. The basic \nrequirements of selecting an inductor are the saturation \ncurrent must be higher than the peak switching current a nd \nthe DC rated current is higher than the average inductor \ncurrent in normal operation. In buck converter, the average \ninductor current is equal to the output current. The inductor \nvalue can be derived from the Equation 2. \n∆IL=VOUT×(VIN-VOUT)\nVIN×L×fSW (2) \nWhere  \n\uf0b7 ΔIL is the inductor peak -to-peak ripple current.  \n\uf0b7 VOUT is the output voltage at no load.  \n\uf0b7 VIN is the input voltage.  \n\uf0b7 fSW is the switching frequency  \nTable 2 lists the recommended inductor specifications.  \nTable 2. Recommended Inductor  \n \n3. Input Capacitor Selection  \nThe input capacitor reduces the surge current drawn from the \ninput and the switching noise from the converter. The input \ncapacitor impedance at the switching frequency should be \nless than the input source impedance to prevent high \nfrequency switching curre nt passing to the input. A low ESR \ninput capacitor sized for maximum RMS current must be \nused. Multilayer Ceramic Capacitor ( MLCC) with X5R or \nX7R dielectric is highly recommended because of their low \nESR, low temperature coefficients and compact size \ncharacteristics. A 1 µF MLCC in parallel with a 100 µF \nelectrolytic capacitor is sufficient for most applications.  \n 4. Output Capacitor Selection  \nThe output capacitor is required to keep the output voltage \nripple small and to ensure regulation loop stability. The \noutput capacitor must have low impedance at the switching \nfrequency. MLCC with X5R or X7R dielectric is \nrecommended due to their low ESR, low temperature \ncoefficients and compact size characteristics. The output \nripple, ∆VOUT, is determined by:  \n∆VOUT≤VOUT×(VIN−VOUT)\nVIN×FSW×L×(ESR+1\n8×FSW×COUT)   (4) \nTable 3 lists the recommended component values . \nLoad  L1  EC1  EC2  C1 C2 \n5 V/1A Peak Load  47µ H/1.4A/  \n6.0 x 6.0 x 4.5mm  100µ F /50V  \nLow ESR  100µ F /10V  \nLow ESR  1µ F/50V \nX7R  1µF/10V  \nX7R  \n5 V/0.7A  47µ H/1.1A/  \n5.0 x 5.0 x 4.0mm  100µ F /50V  \nLow ESR  100µ F /10V  \nLow ESR  1µ F/50V \nX7R  1µF/10V  \nX7R  \n5 V/0.5A  47µ H/0.95A/  \n4.0 x 4.0 x 3.0mm  100µ F /50V  \nLow ESR  100µ F /10V  \nLow ESR  1µ F/50V \nX7R  1µF/10V  \nX7R  \n5 V/0.3A  47µ H/0.74A/  \n4.0 x 4.0 x 2.0mm  100µ F /50V  \nLow ESR  100µ F /10V  \nLow ESR  1µ F/50V \nX7R  1µF/10V  \nX7R  \nTable 3.

These suggestions are also illustrated \ngraphically in Figure 1.  \n1. The power path including the GND trace, the SW trace \nand the VIN trace should be as short as possible, direct \nand wide.  \n2. The VOUT  pin should be connected directly to the point  \nof the output capacitor . \n3. The input decoupling MLCC should be placed as close \nto the VIN and GND pins as possible and connected to \ninput power plane and ground plane directly. This \ncapacitor provides the AC current to the internal power MOSFETs.  \n4. The power path between the output MLCC,  and the \npower inductor should be kept short and the other \nterminal of the capacitor should connect to the ground \nplane directly to reduce noise emission.   \n5. Keep the switching node, SW, away from the sensitive \nVOUT  node.  \n6. Keep the negative terminals of input capacitor and \noutput capacitor as close as possible.  \n7. Use large copper plane and thermal vias for GND for \nthe bes t heat dissipation and noise immunity.  \n \n \nFigure 1.
