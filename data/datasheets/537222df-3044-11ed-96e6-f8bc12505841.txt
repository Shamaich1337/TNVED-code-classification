Each \nADC features wide bandwidth, differential sample -and-hold \nanalog input amplifiers, and shared integrated voltage reference, \nwhich eases design consid erations. A duty cycle stabilizer is \nprovided to compensate for variations in t he ADC clock duty \ncycle, allowing the converters to maintain excellent  performance.  \nThe ADC output data can be routed directly to the two external 16-bit output ports or multiplexed on a single 16 -bit bus. These \noutputs can be set to either 1.8 V C MOS or LVDS.

THERMAL CHARACTERIST ICS \nThe exposed paddle must be soldered to the ground plane for \nthe LFCSP package. Soldering the exposed paddle to the PCB \nincreases the reliability of the solder joints and maximizes the \nthermal capability of the package.  \nTypical θJA is specified for a 4 -layer PCB with a solid ground \nplane. As shown in Table 7, airflow improves heat dissipation, \nwhich reduces θ JA. In addition, metal in direct contact with the \npackage  leads from metal traces, through holes, ground, and \npower planes  reduces θ JA. \nTable 7.

B | Page 29 of 44 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD9650 dual-core analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is \nused for digitizing high frequency, wide dynamic range signals with \ninput frequencies of up to 300 MHz. The user can sample any f S/2 \nfrequency segment from dc to 300 MHz using appropriate low-pass or band-pass filtering at the ADC inputs with little loss in ADC performance. The ADCs can also be operated with independent analog inputs. \nIn quadrature applications, the AD9650 can be used as a baseband \nor direct down-conversion receiver, in which one ADC is used \nfor I input data, and the other is used for Q input data.  \nSynchronization capability is provided to allow synchronized \ntiming between multiple devices. \nProgramming and control of the AD9650 are accomplished \nusing a 3-wire, SPI-compatible serial interface. \nADC ARCHITECTURE \nThe AD9650 architecture consists of a dual front-end sample-\nand-hold circuit, followed by a pipelined, switched-capacitor \nADC. The quantized outputs from each stage are combined into a final 16-bit result in the digital correction logic. The pipelined architecture permits the first stage to operate on a new input \nsample and the remaining stages to operate on the preceding \nsamples. Sampling occurs on the rising edge of the clock. \nEach stage of the pipeline, excluding the last, consists of a low \nresolution flash ADC connected to a switched-capacitor digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and an interstage residue amplifier (MDAC). The MDAC magnifies the difference between the reconstructed DAC output and the flash input for the next stage \nin the pipeline. One bit of redundancy is used in each stage to \nfacilitate digital correction of flash errors. The last stage simply \nconsists of a flash ADC. \nThe input stage of each channel contains a differential sampling \ncircuit that can be ac- or dc-coupled in differential or single-ended modes. The output staging block aligns the data, corrects errors, and passes the data to the output buffers. The output buffers \nare powered from a separate supply, allowing digital output noise to \nbe separated from the analog core. During power-down, the output \nbuffers go into a high impedance state. \nANALOG INPUT CONSIDERATIONS \nThe analog input to the AD9650 is a differential switched-\ncapacitor circuit that has been designed for optimum performance while processing a differential input signal.  \nThe clock signal alternatively switches the input between sample \nmode and hold mode (see Figure 77). When the input is switched into sample mode, the signal source must be capable of charging the sample capacitors and settling within ½ of a clock cycle.  A small resistor in series with each input can help reduce the peak transient current required from the output stage of the driving source. A shunt capacitor can be placed across the inputs to provide dynamic charging currents. This passive network \ncreates a low-pass filter at the ADC input; therefore, the precise \nvalues are dependent on the application. \nIn intermediate frequency (IF) undersampling applications, any \nshunt capacitors should be reduced. In combination with the driving source impedance, the shunt capacitors limit the input bandwidth. Refer to the AN-742  Application Note, Frequency \nDomain Response of Switched-Capacitor ADCs ; the AN-827 \nApplication Note, A Resonant Approach to Interfacing Amplifiers to \nSwitched-Capacitor ADCs ; and the Analog Dialogue  article, \n“Transformer-Coupled Front-End for Wideband A/D Converters, ” \nfor more information on this subject (visit www.analog.com ). \nCPAR1\nCPAR1CPAR2\nCPAR2SS\nSS\nSSCFB\nCFBCS\nCSBIAS\nBIASVIN+x\nH\nVIN–x\n08919-034 \nFigure 77. Switche d-Capacitor Input \nFor best dynamic performance, the source impedances driving \nVIN+x and VIN−x should be matched, and the inputs should \nbe differentially balanced. \nAn internal differential reference buffer creates positive and \nnegative reference voltages that define the input span of the ADC \ncore. The span of the ADC core is set by this buffer to 2 × VREF . \nInput Common Mode \nThe analog inputs of the AD9650  are not internally dc biased. \nIn ac-coupled applications, the user must provide this bias exter-nally. Setting the device so that VCM = 0.5 × AVDD (or 0.9 V) is \nrecommended for optimum performance, but the device functions over a wider range with reasonable performance (see Figure 67). An on-chip, common-mode voltage reference is included in the design and is available from the VCM pin. \nOptimum performance is achieved when the common-mode \nvoltage of the analog input is set by the VCM pin voltage (typically 0.5 × AVDD). The VCM pin must be decoupled to ground by a 0.1 μF capacitor, as described in the Applications \nInformation section. \nAD9650 Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 30 of 44 Common-Mode Voltage Servo \nIn applications where there may be a voltage loss between the VCM \noutput of the AD9650 and the analog inputs, the common-mode \nvoltage servo can be enabled. When the inputs are ac-coupled and a resistance of >100 Ω is placed between the VCM output and the analog inputs, a significant voltage drop can occur and the common-mode voltage servo should be enabled. Setting Bit 0 in Register 0x0F to a logic high enables the VCM servo mode. In \nthis mode, the AD9650 monitors the common-mode input level \nat the analog inputs and adjusts the VCM output level to keep the \ncommon-mode input voltage at an optimal level. If both channels are operational, Channel A is monitored. However, if Channel A is in power-down or standby mode, the Channel B input is monitored. \nDither \nThe AD9650 has an optional dither mode that can be selected \nfor one or both channels. Dithering is the act of injecting a known but random amount of white noise, commonly referred to as dither, into the input of the ADC. Dithering has the effect of \nimproving the local linearity at various points along the ADC \ntransfer function. Dithering can significantly improve the SFDR when quantizing small-signal inputs, typically when the input \nlevel is below −6 dBFS. \nAs shown in Figure 78, the dither that is added to the input of \nthe ADC through the dither DAC is precisely subtracted out digitally to minimize SNR degradation. When dithering is \nenabled, the dither DAC is driven by a pseudorandom number \ngenerator (PN gen). In the AD9650, the dither DAC is precisely \ncalibrated to result in only a very small degradation in SNR and \nSINAD.  \nADC CORE\nDITHER\nDAC\nPN GEN DITHER ENABLEAD9650\nVIN DOUT\n08919-058 \nFigure 78. Dither Block Diagram \nLarge-Signal FFT \nIn most cases, dithering does not improve SFDR for large-signal \ninputs close to full scale, for example, with a −1 dBFS input. For \nlarge-signal inputs, the SFDR is typically limited by front-end sampling distortion, which dithering cannot improve. However, even for such large-signal inputs, dithering may be useful for \ncertain applications because it makes the noise floor whiter. \nAs is common in pipeline ADCs, the AD9650 contains small \nDNL errors caused by random component mismatches that produce spurs or tones that make the noise floor somewhat \nrandomly colored part-to-part. Although these tones are  typically at very low levels and do not limit SFDR when the \nADC is quantizing large-signal inputs, dithering converts these \ntones to noise and produces a whiter noise floor. \nSmall-Signal FFT  \nFor small-signal inputs, the front-end sampling circuit typically \ncontributes very little distortion, and, therefore, the SFDR is likely \nto be limited by tones caused by DNL errors due to random com-ponent mismatches. Therefore, for small-signal inputs (typically, those below −6 dBFS), dithering can significantly improve \nSFDR by converting these DNL tones to white noise.  \nStatic Linearity \nDithering also removes sharp local discontinuities in the INL \ntransfer function of the ADC and reduces the overall peak-to-\npeak INL. \nIn receiver applications, utilizing dither helps to reduce DNL errors \nthat cause small-signal gain errors. Often this issue is overcome by setting the input noise 5 dB to 10 dB above the converter \nnoise. By using dither within the converter to correct the DNL \nerrors, the input noise requirement can be reduced.  \nDifferential Input Configurations \nOptimum performance is achieved while driving the AD9650 \nin a differential input configuration. For baseband applications, \nthe AD8138, ADA4937-2 , and ADA4938-2  differential drivers \nprovide excellent performance and a flexible interface to the ADC.  \nThe output common-mode voltage of the ADA4938-2  is easily \nset with the VCM pin of the AD9650 (see Figure 79), and the \ndriver can be configured in a Sallen-Key filter topology to \nprovide band limiting of the input signal. \nVIN 76.8Ω\n120Ω0.1µF\n200Ω200Ω\n90ΩAVDD33Ω\n33Ω15Ω\n15Ω5pF15pF\n15pFAD9650VIN–x\nVIN+x VCMADA4938-2\n08919-035 \nFigure 79.

Differential Transformer-Coupled Configuration \nData Sheet AD9650\n \nRev. B | Page 31 of 44 The signal characteristics must be considered when selecting \na transformer. Most RF transformers saturate at frequencies below a few megahertz (MHz). Excessive signal power can also \ncause core saturation, which leads to distortion. \nAt input frequencies in the second Nyquist zone and above, the \nnoise performance of most amplifiers is not adequate to achieve \nthe true SNR performance of the AD9650. For applications in \nwhich SNR is a key parameter, differential double balun coupling \nis the recommended input configuration (see Figure 81). In this configuration, the input is ac-coupled, and the CML is provided to each input through a 33 Ω resistor. These resistors compensate \nfor losses in the input baluns to provide a 50 Ω impedance to \nthe driver. \nIn the double balun and transformer configurations, the value of \nthe input capacitors and resistors is dependent on the input fre-quency and source impedance and may need to be reduced or removed. Table 10 displays recommended values to set the RC network. At higher input frequencies, good performance can be achieved by using a ferrite bead in series with a resistor and removing the capacitors. However, these values are dependent \non the input signal and should be used only as a starting guide. \nTable 10.

Regardless of \nthe type of signal being used, clock source jitter is of the most concern, as described in the Jitter Considerations section. \nFigure 87 and Figure 88 show two preferred methods for clocking \nthe AD9650 (at clock rates up to 625 MHz). A low jitter clock \nsource is converted from a single-ended signal to a differential \nsignal using either an RF balun or an RF transformer.  \nThe RF balun configuration is recommended for clock frequencies \nbetween 125 MHz and 625 MHz, and the RF transformer is recom-mended for clock frequencies from 10 MHz to 200 MHz. The \nback-to-back Schottky diodes across the transformer/balun’s \nsecondary windings limit the clock excursions into the AD9650  \nto approximately 0.8 V p-p differential.  \nThis limit helps prevent the large voltage swings of the clock \nfrom feeding through to other portions of the AD9650 while \npreserving the fast rise and fall times of the signal that are critical \nto a low jitter performance.  \n0.1µF\n0.1µF0.1µF 0.1µF\nSCHOTTKY\nDIODES:\nHSMS2822CLOCK\nINPUT\n50Ω100Ω\nCLK–CLK+ADC\nAD9650Mini-Circuits®\nADT1-1WT, 1:1Z\nXFMR\n08919-045 \nFigure 87.

Single-Ended 1.8 V CMOS  Input Clock (Up to 200 MHz)  \nInput Clock Divider \nThe AD9650 contains an input clock divider with the ability to \ndivide the input clock by integer values between 1 and 8. For \ndivide ratios of 1, 2, 4, or 8, the duty cycle stabilizer (DCS) is optional. For other divide ratios, divide-by-3, -5, -6, and -7, the \nduty cycle stabilizer must be enabled for proper part operation.  \nThe AD9650 clock divider can be synchronized using the external \nSYNC input. Bit 0 to Bit 2 of Register 0x100 allow the clock \ndivider to be resynchronized on every SYNC signal or only on \nthe first SYNC signal after the register is written. A valid SYNC \ncauses the clock divider to reset to its initial state. This synchro-nization feature allows multiple parts to have their clock dividers \naligned to guarantee simultaneous input sampling.  \nAD9650  Data Sheet  \n \nClock Duty Cycle  \nTypical high speed ADCs use both clock edges to generate a var iety \nof internal timing signals and, as a result, may be sensi tive to clock \nduty cycle. The AD9650 requires a tight tolerance  on the clock \nduty cycle t o maintain dynamic performance characteristics.  \nThe AD9650 contains a duty cycle stabilizer (DCS) that retimes \nthe nonsampling (falling) edge, providi ng an internal clock signal \nwith a nominal 50% duty cycle. This allows the user to provide \na wide range of clock input duty cycles without a ffecting the \nperformance of the AD9650. Noise and distort ion perform ance \nare nearly flat for a wide range of duty c ycles with the DCS \nenabled . \nJitter in the rising edge of the input is still of paramount concern \nand is not easily reduced by the internal stabilization circuit. The duty cycle control loop does not  function for clock rates of less \nthan 20 MHz,  nominally. The loop has a time constant  associated \nwith it that must  be considered in applications in which  the clock  \nrate can change dynamically. A wait time of 1.5  µs to 5 µs is \nrequired  after a dynamic cloc k frequency increase or decrease \nbefore the DCS loop is relocked to the input signal. During the \ntime period that the loop is not locked, the DCS loop is bypassed, \nand internal device timing is dependent on the duty cycle of the \ninput clock signal. In such  applications, it may be appropriate to  \ndisable  the duty cycle stabilizer. In all other applications, enabling \nthe DCS circuit is recommended to maximize ac performance.  \nJitter Considerations  \nHigh speed, high resolution ADCs are sensitive to the quality  \nof the clock input. For inputs near full scale, t he degradation in \nSNR from the low frequency  SNR (SNR LF) at a given input \nfrequency ( fINPUT) due to jitter (t JRMS) can be calc ulated by  \nSNR HF = −10 log[(2π × f INPUT × tJRMS)2 + 10)10/ (LF SNR−] \nIn the equation, the rms aperture jitter represents the clock input  \njitter specification.  \nImprovements in SNR can be achieved for IF undersampling \napplications by minimizing the effects of ape rture jitter. This \ncan be accomplished by applying a high frequency clock input \nand using  the integrated clock divider to achieve the desired \nsample rate of the ADC core. Inherently, the jitter performance of the AD9650 improves as the fre quency of the clock increases. \nThis is a result of the slew rate of the clock affecting the noise performance of the ADC , where fast transition edges r esult in \nthe best  performance.  Figure 92 shows the improvement in SNR \nfor the different clock divide ratios for the 1  V p-p and 2  V p-p \nsinusoidal clock inputs.  Measurements in Figure 92 were taken \nfor the AD9650BCPZ -105 where th e input frequency was \n141 MHz. The same analysis can be performed  for the various \nspeed grades  of the AD9650 family of parts.   82\n80\n78\n76\n74\n72\n70\n1 4 3 2SNR (dBFS)\nCLK DIVIDE RATIO\n08919-2931V p-p CLK AMPLITUDE2V p-p CLK AMPLITUDE\n \nFigure 92. SNR vs. CLK Divide Ratio  for f IN = 141 MHz and a  \nSample Rate of 105 MSPS  \nThe clock input should be treated as an analog signal in cases in which aperture jitter may affect th e dynamic range of the AD9650. \nPower supplies for clock drivers should be sep arated from the \nADC output driver supplies to avoid modulating the clock signal with digital noise. Low jitter, crystal -controlled oscillators make \nthe best clock sources.  \nRefer to  the AN-501 Application Note and the AN-756 Application \nNote (visit www.analog.com ) for more information about jitter \nperfor mance as it relates to ADCs.  \nCHANNEL/CHIP SYNCHRO NIZATION  \nThe AD9650  has a SYNC input that offers the user flexible \nsynchronization options for synchronizing the clock divider. \nThe clock divider sync feature is useful for guaranteeing synchro-\nnized sample clocks across multiple ADCs. The input clock divider can be enabl ed to synchronize on a single occurrence of \nthe SYNC signal  or on every occurrence.  \nThe SYNC input is internally synchronized to the sample clock; however, to ensure that there is no timing uncertainty between multiple parts, the SYNC input signal should b e externally syn -\nchronized to the input clock signal, meeting the setup and hold \ntimes shown in Table 5. The SYNC input should be driven using \na single -ended CMOS -type signal. \nPOWER DISSIPATION AND STANDBY MODE  \nThe power dissipate d by the AD9650 varies with its sam ple rate. \nIn CMOS output mode, the digital power dissipation is determined \nprimarily by the strength of the digital drivers a nd the load on \neach output bit.  \nThe maximum DRVDD current (IDRVDD)  can be calculated as  \nIDRVDD  = VDRVDD × C LOAD × f CLK × N \nwhere N is the number of output bits ( 32 plus two  DCO outputs  \nin the case of the AD9650).  \nThis maximum current occurs when every output bit switches on every clock cycle, that is, a full- scale square wave at the Nyquist \nfrequency of f\nCLK/2. In practice, the DRVDD current is estab-\nlished by the average number of output b its switching, which is \nRev. B | Page 34 of 44 \nData Sheet  AD9650  \n \ndetermined by the sample rate and the character istics of the \nanalog input signal.  \nReducing the capacitive load pr esented to the output drivers \nreduces  digital power co nsumption.  \nBy asserting PDWN (either through the SPI port or by asserting \nthe PDWN pin high), the AD9650 is placed in power -down \nmode. In this state, the ADC typ ically dissipates 3.3  m W.  \nDuring power -down, the outpu t drivers are placed in a high \nimpedance state. Asser ting the PDWN pin low returns the \nAD9650 to its normal operati ng mode.  \nLow power dissipation in p ower -down mode is achieved by \nshutting down the reference, reference buffer, biasing networks, and clock. Internal capacitors are di scharged when entering power -\ndown mode and must be recharged when r eturning to normal \noperation.  \nWhen using the SPI port in terface, the user can place the ADC \nin power -down mode or standby mode. Standby mode allows \nthe user to keep the internal reference circuitry powered when faster wake -up times are required.  \nDIGITAL OUTPUTS  \nThe AD9650 output drivers can be configured to interface with \n1.8 V CMOS logic families. The AD96 50 can also be configured \nfor LVDS outputs (standard ANSI or reduced output swing mode)  \nusing a DRVDD supply voltage of 1.8 V.  \nIn CMOS output mode, the output drivers are sized to provide sufficient output current to drive a wide variety of logic familie s. \nHowever, large drive currents tend to cause curre nt glitc hes on \nthe supplies that  may affect converter performance.  \nApplications requiring the ADC to drive larg e capacitive loads \nor large fan outs may require external buffers or latches.  \nThe default ou tput mode is C MOS , with each channel output \non a separate bus , as shown in Figure 2. The output can also be \nconfigured for inte rleaved CMOS via the SPI port. In interleaved \nCMOS mode , the data for both channels is output through  the \nChannel A output pins, and the C hannel B output is placed into \nhigh impedance mode.  The timing diagram for interleaved \nCMOS output mode is shown in Figure 3. \nThe output data format can be selected for either offset binary or tw os complement by setting the SCLK/DFS pin when opera ting \nin the external pin mode (see Table 12).  As detailed in  the AN-877 Application Note,  Interfacing to High \nSpeed AD Cs via SPI , the data format can be selected for offset \nbinary, twos complement, or gray code when using the SPI con trol. \nTable 12. SCLK/DFS Mode Selection (External Pin Mode)  \nVoltage at Pin  SCLK/DFS  SDIO/DCS  \nAGND  Offset binary  (def ault) DCS disabled  \nAVDD  Twos complement  DCS enabled  \n(default) \nDigital Output Enable Function (OEB)  \nThe AD9650 has a flexible three -state ability for the digital output \npins. The three -state mode is enabled using the OEB pin or  \nthrough the SPI. If t he OEB pin is low,  the output data drivers and \nDCOs are enabled. If the OEB pin is high, the ou tput data drivers \nand DCOs are placed in a high impedance stat e. This OEB \nfunction is not intended for rapid access to the data bus. Note that OEB is referenced to the digital output driver supply  \n(DRVDD) and should not exceed that supply voltage.  \nWhen using the SPI, the data  outputs and DCO  of each channel \ncan be in dependently three- stated by using the output enable \nbar bit (Bit 4) in Register 0x14.  \nTIMING  \nThe AD9650 provides latched data with a pipeline d elay of  \n12 clock cycles. Data outputs are available one propagation \ndelay (t PD) after the rising edge of the clock signal.  \nThe length of the output data lines and loads placed on them should be minimized to reduce tra nsients within the AD9650. \nThese transients can degrade converter dynamic perform ance.  \nThe lowest typical conversion rate of the AD9650 is 10 MSPS. \nAt clock rates below 10 MSPS, dynamic performance can degrade.  \nData Clock Output (DCO)  \nThe AD9650 provides two data clock output (DCO) sign als \nintended  for capturing the data in an external regi ster. In CMOS \noutput mode, t he data outputs are valid on the rising edge of DCO,  \nunless the DCO clock polarity has been changed via the SPI. In \nLVDS output mode , the DCO and data output switch ing edges  \nare closely aligned. Additional delay can be added to the DCO \noutput using SPI R egister 0x17 to  increase the data setup time. \nIn this case , the Channel A output data is valid on the rising \nedge of DCO , and the C hannel B output data is va lid on the \nfalling  edge of DCO.  See Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4 for a \ngraphical timing description  of the output modes.\nTable 13.

B | Page 35 of 44 \nAD9650 Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 36 of 44 BUILT-IN SELF-TEST (BIST) AND OUTPUT TEST \nThe AD9650 includes built-in test features designed to enable \nverification of the integrity of each channel as well as facilitate \nboard level debugging. A BIST (built-in self-test) feature is included that verifies the integrity of the digital datapath of the AD9650. \nVarious output test options are also provided to place predictable \nvalues on the outputs of the AD9650.  \nBUILT-IN SELF-TEST (BIST) \nThe BIST is a thorough test of the digital portion of the selected \nAD9650 signal path. When enabled, the test runs from an internal \npseudorandom noise (PN) source through the digital datapath starting at the ADC block output. The BIST sequence runs for 512 cycles and stops. The BIST signature value for Channel A or Channel B is placed in Register 0x24 and Register 0x25. If one \nchannel is chosen, its BIST signature is written to the two registers. \nIf both channels are chosen, the results from Channel A are placed \nin the BIST signature registers.  The outputs are not disconnected during this test; therefore, the \nPN sequence can be observed as it runs. The PN sequence can be continued from its last value or reset from the beginning, based on the value programmed in Register 0x0E, Bit 2. The BIST signature result varies based on the channel configuration. \nOUTPUT TEST MODES \nThe output test modes are shown in Table 17. When an output \ntest mode is enabled, the analog section of the ADC is discon-\nnected from the digital back end blocks and the test pattern is run through the output formatting block. Some of the test patterns are subject to output formatting, and some are not. The seed value for the PN sequence tests can be forced if the PN reset bits are used to hold the generator in reset mode by setting Bit 4 or Bit 5 of \nRegister 0x0D. These tests can be performed with or without  \nan analog signal (if present, the analog signal is ignored), but they do require an encode clock.

B | Page 37 of 44 SERIAL PORT INTERFACE (SPI) \nThe AD9650 serial port interface (SPI) allows the user to configure \nthe converter for specific functions or operations through a \nstructured register space provided inside the ADC. The SPI  gives the user added flexibility and customization, depending on \nthe application. Addresses are accessed via the serial port and \ncan be written to or read from via the port. Memory is organized into bytes that can be further divided into fields, which are docu-mented in the Memory Map section. For detailed operational information, see the AN-877 Application Note,  Interfacing to \nHigh Speed ADCs via SPI . \nCONFIGURATION USING THE SPI \nThree pins define the SPI of this ADC: the SCLK/DFS pin, the \nSDIO/DCS pin, and the CSB pin (see Table 14). The SCLK/DFS \n(a serial clock) is used to synchronize the read and write data \npresented from and to the ADC. The SDIO/DCS (serial data \ninput/output) is a dual-purpose pin that allows data to be sent to and read from the internal ADC memory map registers. The CSB (chip select bar) is an active-low control that enables or \ndisables the read and write cycles. \nTable 14. Serial Port Interface Pins \nPin Function \nSCLK Serial clock. The serial shift clock input, which is used to \nsynchronize serial interface reads and writes.  \nSDIO Serial data inp ut/output. A dual-purpose pin that \ntypically serves as an input or an output, depending on \nthe instruction being sent and the relative position in the \ntiming frame.  \nCSB Chip select bar. An active-low control that gates the read and write cycles.  \n The falling edge of the CSB, in conjunction with the rising edge \nof the SCLK, determines the start of the framing. An example of the serial timing and its definitions can be found in Figure 93 \nand Table 5.  \nOther modes involving the CSB are available. When the CSB is \nheld low indefinitely, which permanently enables the device, \nthis is called streaming. The CSB can stall high between bytes to \nallow for additional external timing. When CSB is tied high, SPI functions are placed in high impedance mode. This mode turns \non any SPI secondary pin functions.  \nDuring an instruction phase, a 16-bit instruction is transmitted. \nData follows the instruction phase, and its length is determined \nby the W0 and W1 bits.  \nIn addition to word length, the instruction phase determines \nwhether the serial frame is a read or write operation, allowing \nthe serial port to be used both to program the chip and to read \nthe contents of the on-chip memory. The first bit of the first byte in a multibyte serial data transfer frame indicates whether a read command or a write command is issued. If the instruction is a readback operation, performing a readback causes the serial \ndata input/output (SDIO) pin to change direction from an input to \nan output at the appropriate point in the serial frame. \nAll data is composed of 8-bit words. Data can be sent in MSB-first \nmode or in LSB-first mode. MSB first is the default on power-up and can be changed via the SPI port configuration register.

B | Page 38 of 44 HARDWARE INTERFACE \nThe pins described in Table 14 comprise the physical interface \nbetween the user programming device and the serial port of the \nAD9650. The SCLK pin and the CSB pin function as inputs when using the SPI. The SDIO pin is bidirectional, functioning \nas an input during write phases and as an output during \nreadback.  \nThe SPI is flexible enough to be controlled by either FPGAs or \nmicrocontrollers. One method for SPI configuration is described in detail in the AN-812  Application Note, Micro-\ncontroller-Based Serial Port Interface (SPI) Boot Circuit .  \nThe SPI port should not be active during periods when the full dynamic performance of the converter is required. Because the SCLK signal, the CSB signal, and the SDIO signal are typically asynchronous to the ADC clock, noise from these signals can degrade converter performance. If the on-board SPI bus is used for \nother devices, it may be necessary to provide buffers between \nthis bus and the AD9650 to prevent these signals from transi-\ntioning at the converter inputs during critical sampling periods. \nSome pins serve a dual function when the SPI is not being used. \nWhen the pins are strapped to AVDD or ground during device power-on, they are associated with a specific function. The Digital Outputs section describes the strappable functions supported on the AD9650.  \nCONFIGURATION WITHOUT THE SPI  \nIn applications that do not interface to the SPI control registers, \nthe SDIO/DCS pin, the SCLK/DFS pin, the OEB pin, and the \nPDWN pin serve as standalone CMOS-compatible control pins. When the device is powered up, it is assumed that the user intends to use the pins as static control lines for the duty cycle stabilizer, output data format, output enable, and power-down feature control. In this mode, the CSB chip select bar should be connected to AVDD, which disables the serial port interface.  When the device is in SPI mode, the PDWN and OEB pins remain active. For SPI control of output enable and power-down, \nthe OEB and PDWN pins should be set to their default states.  \nTable 15.

B | Page 39 of 44 MEMORY MAP \nREADING THE MEMORY MAP REGISTER TABLE \nEach row in the memory map register table has eight bit locations. \nThe memory map is roughly divided into four sections: the chip \nconfiguration registers (Address 0x00 to Address 0x02); the channel index and transfer registers (Address 0x05 and  \nAddress 0xFF); the ADC functions registers, including setup, \ncontrol, and test (Address 0x08 to Address 0x30); and the digital \nfeature control register (Address 0x100). \nThe memory map register table (see Table 17) documents the \ndefault hexadecimal value for each hexadecimal address shown. The column with the heading Bit 7 (MSB) is the start of the default hexadecimal value given. For more information on this function and others, see the AN-877 Application Note,  Interfacing \nto High Speed ADCs via SPI.  This application note details the \nfunctions controlled by Register 0x00 to Register 0xFF. The remaining register, Register 0x100, is documented in the Memory \nMap Register Table section.  \nOpen Locations \nAll address and bit locations that are not included in Table 17 \nare not currently supported for this device. Unused bits of a \nvalid address location should be written with 0s. Writing to these \nlocations is required only when part of an address location is \nopen (for example, Address 0x17).  \nDefault Values \nAfter the AD9650  is reset, critical registers are loaded with \ndefault values. The default values for the registers are given in \nthe memory map register table, Table 17. \n Logic Levels \nAn explanation of logic level terminology follows: \n\uf0b7 “Bit is set” is synonymous with “bit is set to Logic 1” or \n“writing Logic 1 for the bit. ”  \n\uf0b7 “Clear a bit” is synonymous with “bit is set to Logic 0” or “writing Logic 0 for the bit. ” \nTransfer Register Map \nAddress 0x08 through Address 0x18 and Address 0x30 are \nshadowed. Writes to these addresses do not affect part \noperation until a transfer command is issued by writing 0x01 to Address 0xFF , setting the transfer bit. This allows these registers to be updated internally and simultaneously when the transfer bit is set. The internal update takes place when the transfer bit is set, and the bit autoclears. \nChannel-Specific Registers \nSome channel setup functions, such as the signal monitor \nthresholds, can be programmed differently for each channel. In \nthese cases, channel address locations are internally duplicated for each channel. These registers and bits are designated in Table 17 \nas local. These local registers and bits can be accessed by setting \nthe appropriate Channel A or Channel B bits in Register 0x05.  If both bits are set, the subsequent write affects the registers of both channels. In a read cycle, only Channel A or Channel B should be set to read one of the two registers.

The clock divider SYNC enable bit \n(Address 0x100, Bit 1) resets after it synchronizes. Bit 1—Clock Divider SYNC Enable \nBit 1 gates the SYNC pulse to the clock divider. The SYNC \nsignal is enabled when Bit 1 is high and Bit 0 is high. This is continuous SYNC mode. \nBit 0—Master SYNC Enable \nBit 0 must be high to enable any of the SYNC functions. If the \nSYNC capability is not used, this bit should remain low to \nconserve power. \n \nData Sheet  AD9650  \n \nAPPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nDESIGN GUIDELINES  \nBefore starting design and layout of the AD9650 as a system,  \nit is recommended that the designer become familiar with these \nguidelines, which discuss the special circuit connections and \nlayout requirements that are needed for certain pins.  \nPower and Ground Recommendations  \nWhen connecting power to the AD9650, it is recommended that two separate 1.8  V supplies be used. Use o ne supply  for the analog  \noutputs (AVDD) ; use a separate supply for the digital outputs \n(DRVDD). For both  AV DD and D RVDD , several different  \ndecoupling capacitors  should  be used  to cover both high and \nlow frequencies. Place t hese  capacitors  close to the point of \nentry at the PCB level and close to the  pins of the part , with \nminimal trace length.  \nA single PCB ground plane should be sufficient when using the \nAD9650. With proper decoupling and smart partitioning of the \nPCB analog, digital, and clock sections, optimum performance is easily achieved.  \nLVDS Operation  \nThe AD9650 defaults to  CMOS output mode on power -up.  \nIf LVDS opera tion is desired , this mode must be programmed, \nusing the SPI configura tion registers after power -up. When the \nAD9650 powers up in CMOS mode with LVDS termination \nresistors (100 Ω ) on the outputs , the DRVDD current can be \nhigher than the typical value until the pa rt is placed in LVDS \nmode. This additional DRVDD current does  not cause damage \nto the  AD9650,  but it should be taken into account  when consid -\nering the maximum DRVDD current for the part.   \nTo avoid this additional DRVDD current , the AD9650 outputs \ncan be disable d at po wer-up by taking the OEB pin high.  After  \nthe part is placed in  LVDS mode via the SPI port , the OEB pin \ncan be taken low to enable the outputs.  \nExposed Paddle Thermal Heat Slug Recommendations  \nIt is mandatory that the exposed paddle on the underside of the \nADC be connected to analog ground (AGND) to achieve the \nbest electrical and thermal performance. A continuous, exposed (no solder mask) copper plane on the PCB should mate to the AD9650 exposed paddle, Pin 0.  The copper plane should have several vias to achieve the lowest possible resistive thermal path for heat dissipation to flow through the bottom of the PCB. These vias should be filled or pl ugged to \nprevent solder wicking through the vias , which can compromise \nthe connection.  \nTo maximize the coverage and adhesion between the ADC and the PCB, a silkscreen should be overlaid to partition the continuous  \nplane on the PCB into several uniform sect ions. This provides \nseveral tie points between the ADC and the PCB  during the reflow \nprocess. Using one continuous plane with no partitions guarantees  \nonly one tie point between the ADC and  the PCB.  For detailed \ninformation about packaging and PCB layout of chip scale \npackages, see the AN-772 Application Note, A Design and \nManufacturing Guide for the Lead Frame Chip Scale Package (LFCSP) , at www.analog.com . \nVCM  \nThe VCM  pin should be decoupled to ground with a 0.1 μF \ncapacitor, as shown in Figure 80. \nRBIAS  \nThe AD9650 requires that a 10 kΩ resistor  be placed between \nthe RB IAS pin and ground. This resisto r sets the ma ster current \nreference of the ADC core and should have at least a 1% to lerance.  \nReference Decoupling  \nThe VREF pin should be externally decoupled to ground with  \na low ESR , 1.0 μF capacit or in parallel with a  low ESR,  0.1 μF \nceramic capacitor.  \nSPI Port  \nThe SPI port should not be active during periods when the full dynamic performance of the converter is required. Because the SCLK, CSB, and SDIO signals are typically asynchronous to the ADC clock, noise from these signals can degrade converter \nperformance. If the on -board SPI bus is used for other devices, \nit may be necessary to provide buffers between this bus and the AD9650 to keep these signals from transitioning at the converter \ninputs during critical sampling periods.  \n \n \nRev.
