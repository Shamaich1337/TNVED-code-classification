Supply \ncurrent with no load is 60 µA and drops to < 1 µA in shutdown. The 2.7 V to 6.0 V input voltage \nrange makes the APS2420 ideally suited for \nsingle Li-Ion, two to four AA battery-powered applications. 100% duty cycle provides low \ndropout operation, extending battery life in \nportable systems. PWM pulse skipping mode operation provides very low output ripple voltage for noise sensitive applications. \nSwitching frequency is internally set at 1 MHz, \nallowing the use of small surface mount inductors and capacitors. The internal \nsynchronous switch increases efficiency and \neliminates the need for an external Schottky diode. Low output voltages are easily supported \nwith the 0.6 V feedback reference voltage. The \nAPS2420 is available in 4 types of SOT-23-5L, SOT-23-6L, DFN-10L 3 mm x 3 mm and MSOP-10EP IC packages. \n \nApplications \n\uf06c Set Top Box \n\uf06c Portable Instruments \n\uf06c Battery Powered Equipment \n\uf06c Wireless Access Point Router and DSL \nModems \n\uf06c Personal and Notebook Computer \n\uf06c Microprocessors and DSP Core Supplies  \n\uf06c Digital Still and Video Cameras \n \n \n \n  \n \n  Features \n\uf06c High Efficiency: Up to 97 %  \n\uf06c 1 MHz Constant Switching Frequency  \n\uf06c 2.0 A Output Current at V IN = 3 V  \n\uf06c Integrated Main Switch and Synchronous \nRectifier \n\uf06c 2.7 V to 6.0 V Input Voltage Range  \n\uf06c Output Voltage as Low as 0.6 V  \n\uf06c 100% Duty Cycle in Dropout  \n\uf06c Quiescent Current: 60 µA(input < 4.2 V)  \n\uf06c Slope Compensated Current Mode Control \nfor Excellent Line and Load Transient Response  \n\uf06c Robust protection features, OCP, SCP, TSD \n\uf06c Same BOM L-C passive components for V IN \n= 5 to V OUT = 3.3 V, 2.5 V, 1.8 V, 1.2 V and \n1.0 V \n\uf06c Shutdown Current < 1 µA \n\uf06c Internal Soft Start Circuitry \n\uf06c Packages: SOT-23-5L, SOT-23-6L, DFN-10L \nand MSOP-10EP.  \n  \n \nEfficiency vs. I OUT @ V OUT=1.8 V \n \nTypical Application Circuit \nEN GNDLX VI N\nAPS2420\nC1\n22µFC322µF  L1 \n2.2µH\nFBR2\n300kΩ\nR1\n150kΩPGC2\n22pF \nENPGVIN\n2.7V ~ 6.0VVOUT\n1.8V, 2A\n 65707580859095100\n00 . 511 . 52Efficiency (%)\nIOUT(A)Vin=2.7V\nVin=3V\nVin=3.6V\nVin=4.2V\nVin=5VVIN=2.7V  \nVIN=3.0V  \nVIN=3.6V  \nVIN=4.2V  \nVIN=5.0V  \nAPS2420       Chipown  \n \nwww.chipown.com Wuxi Chipown Microelectronics Limited                            Rev. 2.2     2 / 15  Order Information  \nOrder Codes  Packages  Shipping Top Markings \nAPS2420ATBER SOT-23-5L 3,000/Reel S3XYP(1) \nAPS2420BTCER SOT-23-6L 3,000/Reel S8XYP(1) \nAPS2420CDFER DFN-10L 3,000/Reel APS2420C \nYYWWP(1) \nAPS2420DMSER MSOP-10EP 4,000/Reel APS2420D \nYYWWP(1) \n                \n     (1).

It utilizes internal \nMOSFETs to achieve high efficiency and can \ngenerate very low output voltage by using internal reference at 0.6 V. It operates at a fixed \nswitching frequency, and uses the slope \ncompensated current mode architecture. This Step-Down DC-DC Converter supplies 2.0 A \noutput current at V\nOUT = 1.8 V with input voltage \nrange from 2.7 V to 6.0 V.  \n Current Mode PWM Control \nSlope compensated current mode PWM control \nprovides stable switching and cycle-by-cycle current limit for excellent load and line \nresponses and protection of the internal main \nswitch (P-Ch MOSFET) and synchronous rectifier (N-CH MOSFET). During normal operation, the \ninternal P-Ch MOSFET is turned on for a certain \ntime to ramp the inductor current at each rising edge of the internal oscillator, and switched off when the peak inductor current is above the \nerror voltage.  The current comparator, I\nCOMP, \nlimits the peak inductor current.  When the main switch is off, the synchronous rectifier will \nbe turned on immediately and stay on until \neither the inductor current starts to reverse, as indicated by the current reversal comparator, \nI\nZERO, or the beginning of the next clock cycle.  \n Idle Mode Operation At very light loads, the APS2420 automatically \nenters pulse skipping Mode.  In the pulse \nskipping Mode, the inductor current may reach zero or reverse on each pulse.  The PWM control \nloop will automatically skip pulses to maintain \noutput regulation.  The bottom MOSFET is turned off by the current reversal comparator, \nI\nZERO, and the switch voltage will ring.  This is \ndiscontinuous mode operation, and is normal behavior for the switching regulator.  Power Good Output (PG) \nP G O O D  i s  a n  o p e n - d r a i n  t y p e  o u t p u t  a n d  requires a pullup resistor. PGOOD is actively held \nlow in soft-start, standby, and shutdown. It is \nreleased when the output voltage rises above 91.5% of nominal regulation point. The PGOOD \nsignal goes low if the output is turned off or falls \nbelow 91.5% of nominal regulation point.  \nDropout Operation \nWhen the input voltage decreases toward the value of the output voltage, the APS2420 allows the main switch to remain on for more than one \nswitching cycle and increases the duty cycle\n(6) \nuntil it reaches 100%.  The output voltage then is the input voltage minus the voltage drop \nacross the main switch and the inductor.  At low \ninput supply voltage, the R\nDS(ON) of the P-\nChannel MOSFET increases, and the efficiency of \nthe converter decreases.  Caution must be \nexercised to ensure the heat dissipated not to exceed the maximum junction temperature of the IC. \n(6). The duty cycle D of a step-down converter \nis defined as:   \nD=T\nON×fOSC×100% ≈VOUT\nVIN×100% \nWhere T ON is the main switch on time and f OSC is \nthe oscillator frequency (1 MHz).  \nMaximum Load Current \nThe APS2420 will operate with input supply voltage as low as 2.7 V, however, the maximum \nload current decreases at lower input due to \nlarge I-R drop on the main switch and synchronous rectifier. The slope compensation \nsignal reduces the peak inductor current as a \nfunction of the duty cycle to prevent sub-harmonic oscillations at duty cycles greater than 50%.  Conversely the current limit increases as \nthe duty cycle decreases.   \n \nAPS2420       Chipown  \n \nwww.chipown.com Wuxi Chipown Microelectronics Limited                            Rev. 2.2     7 / 15  Layout Guidance \nWhen laying out the PCB board, the following \nsuggestions should be taken to ensure proper operation of the APS2420. These items are also \nillustrated graphically in Figure 2 (illustrated by \nAPS2420A).  \n1. The power traces, including the GND trace, \nthe LX trace and the V IN trace should be kept \nshort, direct and wide. \n2. The V FB pin should be connected directly to \nthe feedback resistor. The resistive divider R1/R2 must be connected between the (+) \nplate of C3 and ground.  3. Connect the (+) plate of C1 to the V IN pin as \nclosely as possible. This capacitor provides the AC current to internal power MOSFET.  \n4. Keep the switching node , LX, away from the \nsensitive V FB node.  \n5. Keep the (-) plates of C1 and C3 as close as \npossible.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure2.

Low inductance values are physically smaller but require faster \nswitching, which results in some efficiency loss.  \nThe inductor value can be derived from the following equation: L=V\nOUT×ሺVIN-VOUTሻ\nVIN×∆IL×fOSC \nWhere ∆IL is inductor Ripple Current. Large value \ninductors lower ripple current and small value inductors result in high ripple currents. Choose inductor ripple current approximately 35% of \nthe maximum load current 2000 mA, or ∆I\nL=700 \nmA.  For output voltages above 2.0 V, when light-load \nefficiency is important, the minimum \nrecommended inductor is 2.2 µH. For optimum voltage-positioning load transients, choose an \ninductor with DC series resistance in the 50 m Ω \nto 150 m Ω range.  For higher efficiency at \nheavy loads (above 500 mA), or minimal load regulation (but some transient overshoot), the \nresistance should be kept below 100 m Ω.  The \nDC current rating of the inductor should be at least equal to the maximum load current plus \nhalf the ripple current to prevent core saturation.  \nTable 1 lists some typical surface mount inductors that meet target applications for the \nAPS2420. \n \nVendor P/N L \n(µH) DCR \n(mΩ) I\nRATED \n(A) ISAT \n(A) Size(L x W x H) \n(mm) \nSunlord SWPA4030S2R2NT 2.2 30 2.95 4.9 4.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 \nMag.Layers MMD-05CZ-2R2M-M2 2.2 29 5.5 9 5.7 x 5.4 x 3.0 \nMag.Layers MND-04BZN2R2M-XG 2.2 23.5 8 3.5 4.3 x 4.3 x 2.0 \nTable 1.

The input capacitor impedance at the switching frequency shall be less than input \nsource impedance to prevent high frequency \nswitching current passing to the input.  A low ESR input capacitor sized for maximum RMS current must be used.  Ceramic capacitors with \nX5R or X7R dielectrics are highly recommended \nbecause of their low ESR and small temperature coefficients.  A 22 µF ceramic capacitor for most \napplications is sufficient. Output Capacitor Selection \nThe output capacitor is required to keep the \noutput voltage ripple small and to ensure \nregulation loop stability.  The output capacitor must have low impedance at the switching \nfrequency.  Ceramic capacitors with X5R or X7R \ndielectrics are recommended due to their low ESR and high ripple current.
