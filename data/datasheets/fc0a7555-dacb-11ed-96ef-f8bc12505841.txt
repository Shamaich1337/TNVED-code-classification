In\naddition, this device offers compliance to Bellcore 1089\nrequirements (intra −building).\nLC03−6 Device’s Configurations Options\nProtection of Two High −speed I/O Data Lines\nThe LC03 −6 device is able to protect two high speed data\nlines against transient overvoltage conditions by driving\nthem to a fixed reference point for clamping purposes.\nDepending in the application’s requirements, the LC03 −6\ndevice can be configured for protection in either dif ferential\nmode (Line−to−Line) or common mode (Line −to−ground).\nThe Figure 5 shows the connection for Differential mode(Line−to−Line) and Common mode (Line −to−Ground)\nprotection. The inputs and outputs of the I/O data lines areconnected at terminals 1 to 8, and 4 to 5 while the terminals\n2, 3, 6 and 7 are connected to ground; for better performance,\nit is recommended to minimize parasitic inductances byusing ground planes and minimizing the PCB trace lengthsfor the ground return connections.\nFigure 5. Configuration for Differential\nand Common Mode ProtectionLC03−6\nLine 1\nOut\nLine 2\nOutLine 1\nIn\nLine 2\nInIf differential protection is required by some particular\napplications, then the configuration for differential protectionis made as shown in the Figure 6:\nFigure 6.

The LC03 −6 device is connected\nbetween Tip and Ring on the transmit and receive line pairs.it provides protection to metallic and common mode lightningsurges per Bellcore 1089 intra −building (For further\ninformation, see Bellcore 1089 standard). A metallic voltageis defined as a difference of potential between the T and R\nterminals of a telecommunications pair. Currents caused by\nlightning, in the absence of protector operation and withbalanced terminal equipment and telecommunications loop,cause Tip and Ring conductors to attain the same potentialhence do not produce metallic transients. Common modesurges are suppressed by the isolation of the transformer.\nLC03−6R2\nwww. onsemi.com\n4Figure 7.

The\nlines D+ and D − are used for bi −directional data\ntransmission, and the remaining two lines are reserved forbus voltage and ground. Since USB is a hot plugging andunplugging system, all its four lines have the risk to receive\nESD conditions in the real field of the application.\nTypical ESD protection techniques are commonly formed\nby the combination of different discrete semiconductorproducts which make this technique obsolete andnon−efficient because the interconnections of the discrete\ndevices increase the parasitic inductance effects during atransient condition which reduces significantly the\nperformance of the ESD protection circuit. The LC03 −6\ndevice provides a unique surge protection Diode array\ndesigned to protect two I/O data lines (single USB port)\nagainst damage due to ESD conditions or transient voltageconditions. Because of its low capacitance, it can be used in\nhigh speed I/O data lines such as USB 1.1 components. Inaddition to its low capacitance characteristics, the LC03 −6\ndevice from ON Semiconductor complies with the mostcommon industrial standards for ESD, EFT and surgeprotection: IEC61000 −4−2, IEC61000 −4−4,\nIEC61000 −4−5.\nSOIC−8 NB\nCASE 751 −07\nISSUE AK\nDATE 16 FEB 2011\nSEATING\nPLANE1\n45 8\nN\nJX 45/C0095KNOTES:\n1.
