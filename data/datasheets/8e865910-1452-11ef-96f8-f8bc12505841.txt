#### Description:
The HD-100WEL500PPC is a flexible-twistable waveguide designed for microwave applications. It is constructed from copper and brass, providing durability and excellent conductivity. The waveguide features a black polysulfide rubber jacket, which enhances its flexibility and protects it from environmental factors. The design allows for a maximum twist of 360 degrees per meter, making it suitable for applications where space constraints require bending and twisting without compromising performance.

#### Typical Applications:
The HD-100WEL500PPC waveguide is typically used in microwave communication systems, radar systems, and other high-frequency applications. Its ability to handle high power levels (up to 1 kW) and maintain low attenuation makes it ideal for signal transmission in environments where flexibility and space-saving designs are critical. This component is particularly useful in aerospace, telecommunications, and military applications where reliable microwave signal propagation is essential.
