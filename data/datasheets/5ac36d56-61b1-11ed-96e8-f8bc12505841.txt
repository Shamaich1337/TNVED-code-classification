This \ntest fixture is designed to evaluate the coupler in the same environment that is recommended for installation. \nEnclosed inside the test fixture, is a circuit board that is fabricated using the recommended footprint. The pa rt being \ntested is placed into the test fixture and pressure is applied to the top of the device using a pneumatic piston. A four \nport Vector Network Analyzer is connected to the fixture and is used to measure the S -parameters of the part. Worst \ncase value s for each parameter are found and compared to the specification. These worst case values are reported to \nthe test equipment operator along with a Pass or Fail flag. See the illustrations below.  \n       \n   \n3 dB and 5dB  \nTest Board  Test Board  \nIn Fixture  \nTest Station  \nTest Board  \n \nUSA/Canada:  \nToll Free:  \nEurope:   (315) 432 -8909  \n(800) 411-6596  \n+44 2392 -232392  Available on Tape and \nReel for Pick and Place \nManufacturi ng. \n \n \n \n Model X3C17A1 -03WS                             \nRev C \n \nThe effects of the test fixture on the measu red data must be minimized in order to accurately determine the \nperformance of the device under test. If the line impedance is anything other than 50 \uf057 and/or there is a discontinuity \nat the microstrip to SMA interface, there will be errors in the data for the device under test. The test environment can \nnever be “perfect”, but the procedure used to build and evaluate the test boards (outlined below) demonstrates an \nattempt to minimize the errors associated with testing these devices. The lower the signal lev el that is being \nmeasured, the more impact the fixture errors will have on the data. Parameters such as Return Loss and \nIsolation/Directivity, which are specified as low as 27dB and typically measure at much lower levels, will present the \ngreatest measurem ent challenge.  \n \nThe test fixture errors introduce an uncertainty to the measured data. Fixture errors can make the performance of the \ndevice under test look better or worse than it actually is. For example, if a device has a known return loss of 30dB and \na discontinuity with a magnitude of –35dB is introduced into the measurement path, the new measured Return Loss \ndata could read anywhere between –26dB and –37dB. This same discontinuity could introduce an insertion phase \nerror of up to 1 \uf0b0. \n \nThere are differ ent techniques used throughout the industry to minimize the affects of the test fixture on the \nmeasurement data. Anaren uses the following design and de -embedding criteria:  \n \n\uf0b7 Test boards have been designed and parameters specified to provide trace impedance s of 50 \n\uf0b11\uf057. Furthermore, discontinuities at the SMA to microstrip interface are required to be less than \n–35dB and insertion phase errors (due to differences in the connector interface discontinuities \nand the electrical line length) should be less than \uf0b10.50\uf0b0 from the median value of the four \npaths.  \n \n\uf0b7 A “Thru” circuit board is built. This is a two port, microstrip board that uses the same SMA to \nmicrostrip interface and has the same total length (insertion phase) as the actual test board. The \n“Thru” board m ust meet the same stringent requirements as the test board. The insertion loss \nand insertion phase of the “Thru” board are measured and stored. This data is used to \ncompletely de -embed the device under test from the test fixture. The de -embedded data is \navailable in S -parameter form on the Anaren website (www.anaren.com).   \n \nNote :  The S -parameter files that are available on the anaren.com website include data for frequencies that are \noutside of the specified band. It is important to note that the test fixtu re is designed for optimum performance through \nfrequency band of operation . Some degradation in the test fixture performance will occur above this frequency and \nconnector interface discontinuities of –25dB or more can be expected. This larger discontinuity will affect the data  at \nfrequencies above band of operation . \n \nCircuit Board Layout  \n \nThe dimensions for the Anaren test board are shown below. The test board is printed on Rogers RO4003 material \nthat is 0.032” thick.  Consider the case when a different material is used. First, the pad siz e must remain the same to \naccommodate the part. But, if the material thickness or dielectric constant (or both) changes, the reactance at the \ninterface to the coupler will also change. Second, the linewidth required for 50 \uf057 will be different and this will introduce \na step in the line at the pad where the coupler interfaces with the printed microstrip trace. Both of these conditions will \naffect the performance of the part. To achieve the specified performance, serious attention must be given to the \ndesign an d layout of the circuit environment in which this component will be used.  \n \nIf a different circuit board material is used, an attempt should be made to achieve the same interface pad reactance \nthat is present on the Anaren RO4003 test board. When thinner ci rcuit board material is used, the ground plane will \nbe closer to the pad yielding more capacitance for the same size interface pad. The same is true if the dielectric \nconstant of the circuit board material is higher than is used on the Anaren test board. I n both of these cases, \nnarrowing the line before the interface pad will introduce a series inductance, which, when properly tuned, will \ncompensate for the extra capacitive reactance.

In this case, a wider section of line \nbefore the interface pad (or a larger interface pad) will introduce a shunt capacitance and when properly tuned will \nmatch the perf ormance of the Anaren test board.  \n  \nNotice that the board layout for the 3dB and 5dB couplers is different from that of the 10dB and 20dB couplers. The \ntest board for the 3dB and 5dB couplers has all four traces interfacing with the coupler at the same ang le. The test \nboard for the 10dB and 20dB couplers has two traces approaching at one angle and the other two traces at a different \nangle. The entry angle of the traces has a significant impact on the RF performance and these parts have \nbeen optimized for th e layout used on the test boards shown below.  \n \n \n3 dB and 5dB Test Board  \n \n \nTesting Sample Parts Supplied on Anaren Test Boards  \n \nIf you have received a coupler installed on an Anaren produced microstrip test board, please remember to remove the \nloss of the test board from the measured data. The loss is small enough that it is not of concern for Return Loss and \nIsolation/Directivity, but it should certainly be considered when measuring coupling and calculating the insertion loss \nof the coupler. An S -parameter  file for a “Thru” board (see description of “Thru” board above) will be supplied upon \nrequest. As a first order approximation, one should consider the following loss estimates:  \n \nFrequency Band             Avg. Ins.

This voltage level corresponds to a breakdown resistance capable of handling at \nleast 12dB peaks over average power levels, for very short durations. The breakdown location consistently occurred \nacross the air interface at the coupler contact pad s (see illustration below). The breakdown levels at these points will \nbe affected by any contamination in the gap area around these pads. These areas must be kept clean for optimum \nperformance. It is recommended that the user test for voltage breakdown und er the maximum operating conditions \nand over worst case modulation induced power peaking. This evaluation should also include extreme environmental \nconditions (such as high humidity).  \n \n  \n  \n \n \nOrientation Marker  \n \nA printed circular feature appears on the top  surface of the coupler to designate Pin 1. This orientation marker is not \nintended to limit the use of the symmetry that these couplers exhibit but rather to facilitate consistent placement of \nthese parts into the tape and reel package. This ensures that the components are always delivered with the same \norientation.
