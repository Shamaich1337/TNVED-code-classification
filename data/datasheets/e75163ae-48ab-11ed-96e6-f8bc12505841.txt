The HMC530LP5 & HMC530LP5E integrate resona-tors, negative resistance devices, varactor diodes and feature half frequency and divide-by-4 outputs. The VCO’s phase noise performance is excellent over temperature, shock, and process due to the oscillator’s monolithic structure. Power output is +11 dBm typical from a +5V supply voltage. The prescaler and RF/2  functions can be disabled to conserve current if not required. The voltage controlled oscillator is packaged in a leadless QFN 5x5 mm surface mount package, and requires no external matching components.Triple Output: Fo = 9.5 - 10.8 GHz\n         Fo\n/2 = 4.75 - 5.4 GHz\n         Fo\n/4 = 2.38 - 2.7 GHz\nPout: +11 dBm\nPhase Noise: -110 dBc/Hz @100 kHz Typ.No External Resonator Needed32 Lead 5 x 5 mm SMT Package: 25 mm²Typical Applications\nLow noise MMIC VCO w/Half Frequency, Divide-by-4 \nOutputs for:\n• Point to Point/Multipoint Radio• Test Equipment & Industrial Controls• SATCOM• Military End-Use\nElectrical Specifications,  TA = +25° C, Vcc (Dig), Vcc (Amp), Vcc (RF) = +5V\nParameter Min.
