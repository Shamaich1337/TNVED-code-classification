The HMC717A amplifier uses two gain stages in series, the basic schematic\nfor the amplifier is shown in Figure 3, which forms a low noise amplifier operating from 4.8 GHz to 6 GHz with\nexcellent noise figure performance.\nBasic Schematic for HMC717A\nThe HMC717A has single-ended input and output ports whose impedances are nominally equal to 50 Ω over \nthe 4.8 GHz to 6 GHz frequency range. Consequently, it can directly insert into a 50 Ω system with no required \nimpedance matching circuitry, which also means that multiple HMC717A amplifiers can be cascaded back to \nback without the need for external matching circuitry. The input and output impedances are sufficiently stable vs. \nvariations in temperature and supply voltage that no impedance matching compensation is required. Note that \nit is critical to supply very low inductance ground connections to the backside exposed paddle to ensure stable \noperation. To achieve optimal performance from the HMC717A and prevent damage to the device, the absolute \nmaximum ratings should not be exceeded.\nappLICaTION s INFORM aTION\nThe figure above shows the basic connections for operating the HMC717A. AC couple the input with 1.2 pF \ncapacitor. The RF output of the HMC717A has on chip DC block capacitor which eliminates the need for external \nAC coupling capacitor.  Use the appropriate Rbias resistor values, given in the Absolute Bias Resistor \nRange & Recommended Bias Resistor Values  table on page 6 . The bias conditions previously listed (VDD = 5 \nV, Rbias = 825Ω and VDD = 3 V, Rbias = 5.76kΩ) are the recommended operating points to achieve optimum \nperformance. The data used in this data sheet was taken with the recommended bias conditions. When using \nthe HMC717A with different bias conditions, different performance than what is shown in the Typical Perfor -\nmance Characteristics section may result. Increasing the Vdd level and changing the Rbias resistor to the \nrecommended value, typically improves gain, IP3 and noise figure at the expense of power consumption. This \nbehavior can be seen on Typical Performance Characteristics plots.  \n \n \n\nFor price, delivery, and to place orders: Analog Devices, Inc., One Technology Way, P.O.
