These pro-ducts are suitable for operation in harsh electrical environments and are compliant with the EU directive on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) (89/336/EEC). The level of emissions and \nimmunity are both in compliance. EM immunity includes ESD \nprotection in excess of ±15 kV on all I/O lines (IEC 1000-4-2), fast transient burst protection (IEC 1000\xad4\xad4), and radiated immunity (IEC 1000-4-3). EM emissions include radiated and conducted emissions as required by Information Technology \nEquipment EN 55022, CISPR 22. \nAll devices fully conform to the EIA-232-E and CCITT V .28 \nspecifications and operate at data rates up to 230 kbps. Shut-down and enable control pins are provided on some of the products (see \nTable 1 ). \nThe shutdown function on the ADM211E disables the charge \npump and all transmitters and receivers.

The remaining two receivers remain active, thereby \nallowing monitoring of peripheral devices. This feature allows \nthe device to be shut down until a peripheral device begins communication. The active receivers can alert the processor, \nwhich can then take the ADM213E out of the shutdown mode.  \nOperating from a single 5 V supply, four external 0.1 μF \ncapacitors are required. \nThe ADM207E and ADM208E are available in 24-lead PDIP , SSOP , \navailable in 28-lead SSOP , TSSOP , and SOIC_W packages. All products are backward compatible with earlier ADM2xx products, facilitating easy upgrading of older designs.  \nTable 1.

E | Page 10 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM206E/ADM207E/ADM208E/ADM211E/ADM213E \nare ruggedized RS-232 line drivers/receivers that operate from a \nsingle 5 V supply. Step-up voltage converters coupled with level \nshifting transmitters and receivers allow RS-232 levels to be \ndeveloped while operating from a single 5 V supply. \nFeatures include low power consumption, high transmission \nrates, and compliance with the EU directive on EMC, which includes protection against radiated and conducted interfere-ence, including high levels of electrostatic discharge. \nAll RS-232 inputs and outputs contain protection against electrostatic discharges up to ±15 kV and electrical fast tran-sients up to ±2 kV . This ensures compliance to IEC 1000\xad4\xad2 \nand IEC 1000\xad4\xad4 requirements. \nThe devices are ideally suited for operation in electrically harsh \nenvironments or where RS-232 cables are plugged/unplugged frequently. They are also immune to high RF field strengths \nwithout special shielding precautions. \nEmissions are also controlled to within very strict limits. \nTTL/CMOS technology is used to keep the power dissipation to \nan absolute minimum, allowing maximum battery life in \nportable applications. The ADM2xxE is a modification, enhancement, and improvement to the ADM2xx family and its \nderivatives. It is essentially plug-in compatible and does not \nhave materially different applications. \nCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe internal circuitry consists of four main sections: \n• A charge pump voltage converter. \n• 5 V logic to EIA-232 transmitters. \n• EIA-232 to 5 V logic receivers. \n• Transient protection circuit on all I/O lines. \nCharge Pump DC-to-DC Voltage Converter \nThe charge pump voltage converter consists of a 200 kHz \noscillator and a switching matrix. The converter generates a \n±10 V supply from the input 5 V level. This is done in two \nstages using a switched capacitor technique as illustrated in \nFigure 20  and Figure 21 . First, the 5 V input supply is doubled \nto 10 V using Capacitor C1 as the charge storage element. The \n10 V level is then inverted to generate −10 V using C2 as the \nstorage element. \nCapacitor C3 and Capacitor C4 are used to reduce the output \nripple. If desired, larger capacitors (up to 47 μF) can be used for Capacitor C1 to Capacitor C4. This facilitates direct substitution \nwith older generation charge pump RS-232 transceivers. \nThe V+ and V– supplies can also be used to power external \ncircuitry, if the current requirements are small (see the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics  section). + +VCC\nGNDS1\nS2C1S3\nS4C3V+ = 2VCC\nVCC\nINTERNAL\nOSCILLATOR\n00068-020 \nFigure 20.

Charge Pump Voltage Inverter \nTransmitter (Driver) Section \nThe drivers convert 5 V logic input levels into EIA-232 output \nlevels. With V CC = 5 V and driving an EIA-232 load, the output \nvoltage swing is typically ±9 V . \nUnused inputs can be left unconnected, as an internal 400 kΩ \npull-up resistor pulls them high, forcing the outputs into a low state. The input pull-up resistors typically source 8 μA when \ngrounded, so unused inputs should either be connected to V\nCC \nor left unconnected in order to minimize power consumption. \nReceiver Section \nThe receivers are inverting level shifters that accept EIA-232 input \nlevels and translate them into 5 V logic output levels. The inputs \nhave internal 5 kΩ pull-down resistors to ground and are \nprotected against overvoltages of up to ±25 V . The guaranteed \nswitching thresholds are 0.4 V minimum and 2.4 V maximum. \nUnconnected inputs are pulled to 0 V by the internal 5 kΩ pull-down resistor. This, therefore, results in a Logic 1 output level for \nunconnected inputs or for inputs connected to GND. \nThe receivers have Schmitt trigger inputs with a hysteresis level \nof 0.65 V . This ensures error-free reception for both noisy inputs and for inputs with slow transition times. \nENABLE AND SHUTDOWN \nTable 3  and Table 4  are truth tables for the enable and shutdown \ncontrol signals. The enable function is intended to facilitate data \nbus connections where it is desirable to tristate the receiver \noutputs. In the disabled mode, all receiver outputs are placed in a high impedance state. The shutdown function is intended to \nshut down the device, thereby minimizing the quiescent \ncurrent. In shutdown, all transmitters are disabled and all \nreceivers on the ADM211E are tristated.  \n  ADM206E/ADM207E/ADM 208E/ADM211E/ADM213E\n \nRev. E | Page 11 of 20 On the ADM213E, Receiver R4 and Receiver R5 remain \nenabled in shutdown. Note that the transmitters are disabled but are not tristated in shutdown; it is not permitted to connect \nmultiple (RS-232) driver outputs together. \nThe shutdown feature is very useful in battery-operated systems \nsince it reduces the power consumption to 1 μW . During \nshutdown, the charge pump is also disabled. The shutdown \ncontrol input is active high on the ADM211E, and it is active low on the ADM213E. When exiting shutdown, the charge \npump is restarted, and it takes approximately 100 μs for it to \nreach its steady state operating condition. \nHIGH BAUD RATE \nThe ADM2xxE feature high slew rates, permitting data \ntransmission rates well in excess of the EIA-232-E specifications. RS-232 levels are maintained at data rates up to \n230 kbps, even under worst-case loading conditions. This \nallows for high speed data links between two terminals, making \nit suitable for the new generation modem standards that require data rates of 200 kbps. The slew rate is controlled internally to \nless than 30 V/μs to minimize EMI interference. \ntDR3V\n0VEN INPUT\nRECEIVER\n OUTPUT\nNOTES\n1.

Receiver Enable Timing \nESD/EFT TRANSIENT PROTECTION SCHEME \nThe ADM2xxE use protective clamping structures on all inputs \nand outputs that clamp the voltage to a safe level and dissipate \nthe energy present in ESD (electrostatic) and EFT (electrical \nfast transient) discharges. A simplified schematic of the  protection structure is shown in Figure 24  and Figure 25 . Each \ninput and output contains two back-to-back high speed \nclamping diodes. During normal operation, with maximum RS\xad232 signal levels, the diodes have no effect because one or \nthe other is reverse biased, depending on the polarity of the \nsignal. If, however, the voltage exceeds about ±50 V , reverse breakdown occurs, and the voltage is clamped at this level. The diodes are large p-n junctions designed to handle the \ninstantaneous current surges that can exceed several amperes. \nThe transmitter outputs and receiver inputs have a similar \nprotection structure. The receiver inputs can also dissipate some \nof the energy through the internal 5 kΩ resistor to GND as well \nas through the protection diodes. \nThe protection structure achieves ESD protection up to \n±15 kV and EFT protection up to ±2 kV on all RS-232 I/O lines. The methods used to test the protection scheme are discussed in the \nESD Testing (IEC 1000\xad4\xad2)  and EFT/Burst \nTesting (IEC 1000\xad4\xad4)  sections. \nRINRX\nD1\nD2R1RECEIVER\nINPUT\n00068-024 \nFigure 24.

Transmitter Output Protection Scheme \nESD TESTING (IEC 1000-4-2) \nIEC 1000-4-2 (previously IEC 801-2) specifies compliance \ntesting using two coupling methods, contact discharge and air-\ngap discharge. Contact discharge calls for a direct connection to \nthe unit being tested. Air-gap discharge uses a higher test voltage \nbut does not make direct contact with the unit under test. With \nair-gap discharge, the discharge gun is moved toward the unit under test, developing an arc across the air gap. This method is influenced by humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, \ndistance, and rate of closure of the discharge gun. The contact \ndischarge method, while less realistic, is more repeatable and is \ngaining acceptance in preference to the air-gap method. \nAlthough very little energy is contained within an ESD pulse, \nthe extremely fast rise time, coupled with high voltages, can \ncause failures in unprotected semiconductors. Catastrophic  \nADM206E/ADM207E/ADM 208E/ADM211E/ADM213E  \n \nRev. E | Page 12 of 20 destruction can occur immediately because of arcing or heating. \nEven if catastrophic failure does not occur immediately, the device can suffer from parametric degradation that can result in degraded performance. The cumulative effects of continuous exposure can eventually lead to complete failure. \nI/O lines are particularly vulnerable to ESD damage. Simply \ntouching or plugging in an I/O cable can result in a static \ndischarge that can damage or destroy the interface product \nconnected to the I/O port. Traditional ESD test methods, such as the MIL-STD-883B method 3015.7, do not fully test product \nsusceptibility to this type of discharge. This test was intended to \ntest product susceptibility to ESD damage during handling. \nEach pin is tested with respect to all other pins. \nThere are some important differences between the traditional \ntest and the IEC test: \n• The IEC test is much more stringent in terms of discharge \nenergy. The peak current injected is over four times greater. \n• The current rise time is significantly faster in the IEC test. \n• The IEC test is carried out while power is applied to the device. \nIt is possible that the ESD discharge could induce latch-up in the device being tested. This test, therefore, is more represent-tative of a real-world I/O discharge, where the equipment is operating normally with power applied. However, both tests should be performed to ensure maximum protection both \nduring handling and later during field service. \nR1 R2\nC1\nESD TEST METHOD R2 C1\nH.

Pins are tested with respect to all other pins as per the MIL-STD-883B specification. In addition, all I/O \npins are tested per the IEC test specification. The products are \ntested under the following conditions: \n• Power on (normal operation). \n• Power on (shutdown mode). \n• Power off. \nThere are four levels of compliance defined by IEC 1000-4-2. \nADM2xxE products meet the most stringent compliance level \nboth for contact and for air-gap discharge. This means that the \nproducts are able to withstand contact discharges in excess of \n8 kV and air-gap discharges in excess of 15 kV . \nTable 7.

Electrical fast transients occur because of arcing \ncontacts in switches and relays. The tests simulate the \ninterference generated when, for example, a power relay \ndisconnects an inductive load. A spark is generated due to the \nwell-known back EMF effect. In fact, the spark consists of a  \n  ADM206E/ADM207E/ADM 208E/ADM211E/ADM213E\n \nRev. E | Page 13 of 20 burst of sparks as the relay contacts separate. The voltage \nappearing on the line, therefore, consists of a burst of extremely fast transient impulses. A similar effect occurs when switching \non fluorescent lights. \nThe fast transient burst test defined in IEC 1000-4-4 simulates \nthis arcing; its waveform is illustrated in Figure 29 . It consists of \na burst of 2.5 kHz to 5 kHz transients repeating at 300 ms \nintervals. It is specified for both power and data lines. \n300ms 15mstV\n5ns\n0.2ms/0.4ms50nsV\nt\n00068-029 \nFigure 29.

The clamp is 1 m long and surrounds the cable \ncompletely, providing maximum coupling capacitance (50 pF to \n200 pF typical) between the clamp and the cable. High energy transients are capacitively coupled onto the signal lines. Fast rise \ntimes (5 ns), as specified by the standard, result in very effective \ncoupling. Because high voltages are coupled onto the signal \nlines, this test is very severe. The repetitive transients can often cause problems where single pulses do not. Destructive latch-up can be induced due to the high energy content of the transients. \nNote that this stress is applied while the interface products are \npowered up and are transmitting data. The EFT test applies \nhundreds of pulses with higher energy than ESD. Worst-case \ntransient current on an I/O line can be as high as 40 A. \nTest results are classified according to the following: \n• Classification 1: Normal performance within speci-\nfication limits. \n• Classification 2: Temporary degradation or loss of performance that is self recoverable. • Classification 3: Temporary degradation or loss of function or performance that requires operator intervention or system reset. \n• Classification 4: Degradation or loss of function that is not \nrecoverable due to damage. \nADM2xxE products meet Classification 2 and have been tested \nunder worst-case conditions using unshielded cables. Data transmission during the transient condition is corrupted, but it can resume immediately following the EFT event without user \nintervention. \nRCRM\nCCL\nZSCD\n50Ω\nOUTPUTHIGH\nVOLTAGE\nSOURCE\n00068-030 \nFigure 30. IEC 1000-4-4 Fast Transient Generator \nIEC 1000-4-3 RADIATED IMMUNITY \nIEC 1000-4-3 (previously IEC 801-3) describes the measure-\nment method and defines the levels of immunity to radiated \nelectromagnetic fields. It was originally intended to simulate the \nelectromagnetic fields generated by portable radio transceivers or any other devices that generate continuous wave-radiated \nEM energy. Its scope has since been broadened to include \nspurious EM energy that can be radiated from fluorescent \nlights, thyristor drives, inductive loads, and other sources. \nTesting for immunity involves irradiating the device with an EM \nfield. There are various methods of achieving this, including use of anechoic chamber, stripline cell, TEM cell, and GTEM cell. A stripline cell consists of two parallel plates with an electric field developed between them. The device under test is placed within \nthe cell and exposed to the electric field. There are three severity \nlevels having field strengths ranging from 1 V/m to 10 V/m. \nResults are classified in a similar fashion to those for IEC 1000\xad4\xad4. \n• Classification 1: Normal operation. \n• Classification 2: Temporary degradation or loss of function \nthat is self recoverable when the interfering signal is removed. \n• Classification 3: Temporary degradation or loss of function that requires operator intervention or system reset when the interfering signal is removed. \n• Classification 4: Degradation or loss of function that is not recoverable due to damage. \nThe ADM2xxE family of products easily meets Classification 1 at \nthe most stringent requirement (Level 3). In fact, field strengths \nup to 30 V/m showed no performance degradation, and error-\nfree data transmission continued even during irradiation. \nADM206E/ADM207E/ADM 208E/ADM211E/ADM213E  \n \nRev.

The objective of the standard is to minimize the \nlevel of emissions, both conducted and radiated. \nFor ease of measurement and analysis, conducted emissions are \nassumed to predominate below 30 MHz, and radiated emissions \nare assumed to predominate above 30 MHz. \nCONDUCTED EMISSIONS \nThis is a measure of noise that is conducted onto the line power \nsupply. Switching transients from the charge pump that are 20 V \nin magnitude and that contain significant energy can lead to \nconducted emissions. Another source of conducted emissions is the overlap in switch-on times in the charge pump voltage \nconverter. In the voltage doubler shown in \nFigure 31 , if S2 has \nnot fully turned off before S4 turns on, a transient current glitch \noccurs between V CC and GND that results in conducted emis-\nsions. Therefore, it is important that the switches in the charge \npump guarantee break-before-make switching under all condi-\ntions so instantaneous short-circuit conditions do not occur. \nThe ADM2xxE have been designed to minimize the switching \ntransients and ensure break-before-make switching, thereby \nminimizing conducted emissions.  This results in emission \nlevels well below specified limits. Other than the recom-\nmended 0.1 μF capacitor, no additional filtering/decoupling \nis required. \nConducted emissions are measured by monitoring the line \npower supply. The equipment used consists of a line impedance stabilizing network (LISN) that essentially presents a fixed \nimpedance at RF and a spectrum analyzer. The spectrum \nanalyzer scans for emissions up to 30 MHz. A plot for the \nADM211E is shown in \nFigure 33 . \n+ +VCC\nGNDS1\nS2C1S3\nS4C3V+ = 2V CC\nVCC\nINTERNAL\nOSCILLATOR\n00068-031 \nFigure 31.

RS-232 outputs designed for operation at high baud \nrates while driving cables can radiate high frequency EM \nenergy. The previously described causes of conducted emissions can also cause radiated emissions. Fast RS-232 output tran-\nsitions can radiate interference, especially when lightly loaded \nand driving unshielded cables. Charge pump devices are also prone to radiating noise due to the high frequency oscillator and the high voltages being switched by the charge pump. The move toward smaller capacitors in order to conserve board \nspace has resulted in higher frequency oscillators being em-\nployed in the charge pump design, resulting in higher levels of \nconducted and radiated emissions. \nThe RS-232 outputs on the ADM2xxE products feature a con-\ntrolled slew rate in order to minimize the level of radiated emissions, yet they are fast enough to support data rates of up to \n230 kbps. \n  ADM206E/ADM207E/ADM 208E/ADM211E/ADM213E\n \nRev.
