Connecte d between the signal or data line and the ground the VBUS05L1-DD1 offers a high  \nisolation (low leakage current, lowest capacitance) within the specified working range. Due to the short leads and small packag e \nsize of the tiny LLP1006-2M package the line inductance is very low, so that fast transients like an ESD strike can be clamped  \nwith minimal over- or undershoots.\nTYPICAL CHARACTERISTICS (Tamb = 25 °C, unless otherwise specified)\nFig. 1 - ESD Discharge Current Wave Form\n acc.
