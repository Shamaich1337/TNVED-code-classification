In this\nway it has been possible to make all the control\ninputs TTL, CMOS and µC compatible and elimi-\nnate the necessity of external MOS drive compo-\nnents. The Logic Drive is shown in table 1.\nTable 1\nInputs\nOutput Mosfets (*)\nVEN = HIN1 IN2\nL\nL\nHHL\nH\nL\nHSink 1,  Sink 2\nSink 1,  Source 2Source 1,  Sink 2Source 1,  Source 2\nV\nEN = L X X All transistors turned oFF\nL = Low                H = High           X = DON’t care\n(*) Numbers referred to INPUT1 or INPUT2 controlled output stages\nAlthough the device guarantees the absence of\ncross-conduction, the presence of the intrinsic di-\nodes in the POWER DMOS structure causes thegeneration of current spikes on the sensing termi-\nnals. This is due to charge-discharge phenomena\nin the capacitors C1 & C2 associated with thedrain source junctions (fig. 14). When the output\nswitches from high to low, a current spike is gen-\nerated associated with the capacitor C1. On the\nlow-to-high transition a spike of the same polarity\nis generated by C2, preceded by a spike of theopposite polarity due to the charging of the input\ncapacity of the lower POWER DMOS transistor\n(fig. 15).TRANSISTOR OPERATION\nON State\nWhen one of the POWER DMOS transistor is ON\nit can be considered as a resistor R\nDS (ON)\nthroughout the recommended operating range. In\nthis condition the dissipated power is given by : \nPON = RDS (ON) ⋅ IDS2 (RMS)\nThe low R DS (ON) of the Multipower-BCD process\ncan provide high currents with low power dissipa-\ntion.\nOFF State\nWhen one of the POWER DMOS transistor is\nOFF the V DS voltage is equal to the supply volt-\nage and only the leakage current I DSS flows. The\npower dissipation during this period is given by :\nPOFF = VS ⋅ IDSS\nThe power dissipation is very low and is negligible\nin comparison to that dissipated in the ON\nSTATE.\nTransitions\nAs already seen above the transistors have an in-\ntrinsic diode between their source and drain that\ncan operate as a fast freewheeling diode inswitched mode applications. During recirculation\nwith the ENABLE input high, the voltage drop\nacross the transistor is R\nDS (ON) ⋅ ID and when it\nreaches the diode forward voltage it is clamped.\nWhen the ENABLE input is low, the POWER\nMOS is OFF and the diode carries all of the recir-culation current. The power dissipated in the tran-\nsitional times in the cycle depends upon the volt-\nage-current waveforms and in the driving mode.(see Fig. 7ab and Fig. 8abc).\nP\ntrans. = IDS (t) ⋅ VDS (t)Figure 14:  Intrinsic Structures in the POWER\nDMOS TransistorsFigure 15:  Current Typical Spikes on the Sens-\ning PinL6201 - L6202 - L6203\n10/20\nBoostrap Capacitors\nTo ensure that the POWER DMOS transistors are\ndriven correctly gate to source voltage of typ. 10\nV must be guaranteed for all of the N-channel\nDMOS transistors. This is easy to be provided forthe lower POWER DMOS transistors as their\nsources are refered to ground but a gate voltage\ngreater than the supply voltage is necessary todrive the upper transistors. This is achieved by an\ninternal charge pump circuit that guarantees cor-\nrect DC drive in combination with the boostrap cir-cuit. For efficient charging the value of the boos-\ntrap capacitor should be greater than the input\ncapacitance of the power transistor which is\naround 1 nF. It is recommended that a capaci-\ntance of at least 10 nF is used for the bootstrap. Ifa smaller capacitor is used there is a risk that the\nPOWER transistors will not be fully turned on and\nthey will show a higher RDS (ON). On the otherhand if a elevated value is used it is possible that\na current spike may be produced in the sense re-\nsistor.\nReference Voltage\nTo by-pass the internal Ref. Volt. circuit it is rec-\nommended that a capacitor be placed between its\npin and ground. A value of 0.22 µF should be suf-\nficient for most applications. This pin is also pro-tected against a short circuit to ground: a max.\ncurrent of 2mA max. can be sinked out.\n \nDead Time\nTo protect the device against simultaneous con-\nduction in both arms of the bridge resulting in a\nrail to rail short circuit, the integrated logic control\nprovides a dead time greater than 40 ns.\nThermal Protection\nA thermal protection circuit has been included\nthat will disable the device if the junction tempera-\nture  reaches 150 °C. When the temperature has\nfallen to a safe level the device restarts the inputand enable signals under control.APPLICATION INFORMATION\nRecirculationDuring recirculation with the ENABLE input high,\nthe voltage drop across the transistor is RDS(ON)⋅ IL, clamped at a voltage depending on the\ncharacteristics of the source-drain diode. Al-\nthough the device is protected against cross con-duction, current spikes can appear on the current\nsense pin due to charge/discharge phenomena in\nthe intrinsic source drain capacitances. In the ap-plication this does not cause any problem be-\ncause the voltage spike generated on the sense\nresistor is masked by the current controller circuit.\nRise Time T\nr (See Fig. 16)\nWhen a diagonal of the bridge is turned on cur-\nrent begins to flow in the inductive load until themaximum current I\nL is reached after a time T r.\nThe dissipated energy E OFF/ON is in this case :\nEOFF/ON = [RDS (ON)  ⋅ IL2 ⋅ Tr] ⋅ 2/3\nLoad Time T LD (See Fig.16) \nDuring this time the energy dissipated is due to\nthe ON resistance of the transistors (E LD) and due\nto commutation (E COM). As two of the POWER\nDMOS transistors are ON, E ON is given by :\nELD = IL2 ⋅ RDS (ON)  ⋅ 2 ⋅ TLD\nIn the commutation the energy dissipated is : \nECOM = VS ⋅ IL ⋅ TCOM ⋅ fSWITCH ⋅ TLD\nWhere : \nTCOM = TTURN-ON = TTURN-OFF \nfSWITCH = Chopping frequency. \nFall Time T f (See Fig. 16)\nIt is assumed that the energy dissipated in this\npart of the cycle takes the same form as that\nshown for the rise time :\nEON/OFF = [RDS (ON) ⋅ IL2 ⋅  Tf] ⋅ 2/3\nFigure 16.L6201  - L6202 - L6203\n11/20\nQuiescent Energy\nThe last contribution to the energy dissipation is\ndue to the quiescent supply current and is given by:\nEQUIESCENT  = IQUIESCENT  ⋅ Vs ⋅ T\nTotal Energy Per Cycle\nETOT = EOFF/ON + ELD + ECOM +\n+ EON/OFF + EQUIESCENT\nThe Total Power Dissipation P DIS is simply :\nPDIS = ETOT/T\nTr = Rise time\nTLD  = Load drive time\nTf = Fall time \nTd = Dead time\nT = PeriodT = T\nr + TLD + Tf + Td\nDC Motor Speed Control\nSince the I.C. integrates a full H-Bridge in a single\npackage it is idealy suited for controlling DC mo-\ntors. When used for DC motor control it performsthe power stage required for both speed and di-\nrection control. The device can be combined with\na current regulator like the L6506 to implement atransconductance amplifier for speed control, as\nshown in figure 17. In this particular configuration\nonly half of the L6506 is used and the other half\nof the device may be used to control a secondmotor.\nThe L6506 senses the voltage across the sense\nresistor R\nS to monitor the motor current: it com-\npares the sensed voltage both to control the\nspeed and during the brake of the motor.\nBetween the sense resistor and each sense input\nof the L6506 a resistor is recommended; if the\nconnections between the outputs of the L6506and the inputs of the L6203 need a long path, a\nresistor must be added between each input of the\nL6203 and ground.\nA snubber network made by the series of R and C\nmust be foreseen very near to the output pins of\nthe I.C.; one diode (BYW98) is connected be-\ntween each power output pin and ground as well.\nThe following formulas can be used to calculate\nthe snubber values:\nR  ≅ V\nS/lp\nC = lp/(dV/dt) where:\nVS is the maximum Supply Voltage foreseen on\nthe application;\nIp is the peak of the load current;\ndv/dt is the limited rise time of the output voltage(200V/µs is generally used).\nIf the Power Supply Cannot Sink Current, a suit-\nable large capacitor must be used and connectednear the supply pin of the L6203. Sometimes a\ncapacitor at pin 17 of the L6506 let the application\nbetter work. For motor current up to 2A max., theL6202 can be used in a similar circuit configura-\ntion for which a typical Supply Voltage of 24V is\nrecommended.\nFigure 17:  Bidirectional DC Motor ControlL6201 - L6202 - L6203\n12/20\nBIPOLAR STEPPER MOTORS APPLICATIONS\nBipolar stepper motors can be driven with one\nL6506 or L297, two full bridge BCD drivers and\nvery few external components. Together these\nthree chips form a complete microprocessor-to-stepper motor interface is realized.As shown in Fig. 18 and Fig. 19, the controller\nconnect directly to the two bridge BCD drivers.\nExternal component are minimalized: an R.C. net-work to set the chopper frequency, a resistive di-\nvider (R1; R2) to establish the comparator refer-\nence voltage and a snubber network made by Rand C in series (See DC Motor Speed Control).\nFigure 19:  Two Phase Bipolar Stepper Motor Control Circuit with Chopper Current Control and TranslatorFigure 18:  Two Phase Bipolar Stepper Motor Control Circuit with Chopper Current Control\nL6201\nL6201PSL6202\nL6203\nL6201L6201PS\nL6202\nL6203\nL6201\nL6201PS\nL6202\nL6203\nL6201L6201PSL6202\nL6203L6201  - L6202 - L6203\n13/20\nIt could be requested to drive a motor at V S lower\nthan the minimum recommended one of 12V\n(See Electrical Characteristics); in this case, byaccepting a possible small increas in the R\nDS (ON)\nresistance of the power output transistors at thelowest Supply Voltage value, may be a good solu-tion the one shown in Fig. 20.\nTHERMAL CHARACTERISTICS\nThanks to the high efficiency of this device, often\na true heatsink is not needed or it is simply ob-tained by means of a copper side on the P.C.B.\n(L6201/2).\nUnder heavy conditions, the L6203 needs a suit-able cooling.\nBy using two square copper sides in a similar way\nas it shown in Fig. 23, Fig. 21 indicates how tochoose the on board heatsink area when the\nL6201 total power dissipation is known since:\nR\nTh j-amb = (Tj max. – Tamb max) / Ptot\nFigure 22 shows the Transient Thermal Resis-\ntance vs. a single pulse time width.Figure 23 and 24 refer to the L6202.\nFor the Multiwatt L6203 addition information is\ngiven by Figure 25 (Thermal Resistance Junction-Ambient vs. Total Power Dissipation) and Figure\n26 (Peak Transient Thermal Resistance vs. Re-\npetitive Pulse Width) while Figure  27 refers to thesingle pulse Transient Thermal Resistance.Figure 20:  L6201/1P/2/3 Used at a Supply Volt-\nage Range Between 9 and 18VFigure 21:  Typical R Th J-amb vs. "On Board"\nHeatsink Area (L6201)\nFigure 22:  Typical Transient R TH in Single Pulse\nCondition (L6201)\nFigurre 23:  Typical R Th J-amb vs. Two "On Board"\nSquare Heatsink (L6202)L6201\nL6201PSL6202\nL6203L6201 - L6202 - L6203\n14/20\nFigure 24 : Typical Transient Thermal Resistance\n for Single Pulses (L6202)Figure 25:  Typical R Th J-amb of Multiwatt\nPackage vs. Total Power Dissipation\nFigure 26:  Typical Transient Thermal Resistance\n for Single Pulses with and without\n Heatsink (L6203)Figure 27:  Typical Transient Thermal Resistance\n versus Pulse Width and Duty Cycle\n (L6203)L6201  - L6202 - L6203\n15/20\nPowerdip 18DIM.mm inch\nMIN.
