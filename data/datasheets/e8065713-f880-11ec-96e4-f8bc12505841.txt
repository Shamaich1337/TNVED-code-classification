Serial MRAM implements a subset of commands common to today’s SPI EEPROM and \nFlash components allowing MRAM to replace these components in the same socket and interoperate on \na shared SPI bus. Serial MRAM offers superior write speed, unlimited endurance, low standby & operating \npower, and more reliable data retention compared to available serial memory alternatives.\n128KB\nMRAM ARRAYInstruction Decode\nClock Generator\nControl Logic\nWrite ProtectWP\nCS\nHOLD\nSCK\nSIInstruction Register\nAddress Register \nCounter\nSOData I/O Register\nNonvolatile Status\nRegister17 8\n41.

Pins SCK, SO and SI are \ncommon among devices. Each device requires CS and HOLD  pins to be driven separately.  \nFigure 1.2 System Configuration\n3\nCopyright © Everspin Technologies 2018 MR25H10 Rev. 9.5 3/2018MR25H10Signal Name Pin I/O Function Description \nCS 1 Input Chip SelectAn active low chip select for the serial MRAM. When chip select is high, the \nmemory is powered down to minimize standby power, inputs are ignored \nand the serial output pin is Hi-Z. Multiple serial memories can share a com -\nmon set of data pins by using a unique chip select for each memory.\nSO 2 Output Serial OutputThe data output pin is driven during a read operation and remains Hi-Z at \nall other times. SO is Hi-Z when HOLD  is low. Data transitions on the data \noutput occur on the falling edge of SCK.\nWP 3 Input HoldA low on the write protect input prevents write operations to the Status \nRegister.\nVSS4 Supply Ground Power supply ground pin.\nSI 5 Input Serial InputAll data is input to the device through this pin. This pin is sampled on the \nrising edge of SCK and ignored at other times. SI can be tied to SO to create \na single bidirectional data bus if desired.\nSCK 6 Input Serial ClockSynchronizes the operation of the MRAM. The clock can operate up to 40 \nMHz to shift commands, address, and data into the memory. Inputs are \ncaptured on the rising edge of clock. Data outputs from the MRAM occur \non the falling edge of clock. The serial MRAM supports both SPI Mode 0 \n(CPOL=0, CPHA=0) and Mode 3 (CPOL=1, CPHA=1). In Mode 0, the clock is \nnormally low. In Mode 3, the clock is normally high. Memory operation is \nstatic so the clock can be stopped at any time.\nHOLD 7 Input HoldA low on the Hold pin interrupts a memory operation for another task. \nWhen HOLD  is low, the current operation is suspended. The device will \nignore transitions on the CS and SCK when HOLD  is low. All transitions of \nHOLD  must occur while CS is low.\nVDD8 Supply Power Supply Power supply voltage from +2.7 to +3.6 volts.Table 1.1  Pin FunctionsFigure 1.3  Pin Diagrams (Top View)\n8-Pin DFN or 8-Pin DFN Small Flag PackageDEVICE PIN ASSIGNMENT\nCS\nSO\nWP\nV   V\nHOLD\nSCK\nSI1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5 SSDD\n4\nCopyright © Everspin Technologies 2018 MR25H10 Rev. 9.5 3/2018MR25H102.

For \nboth modes,  inputs are captured on the rising edge of the clock and data outputs occur on the falling \nedge of the clock. When not conveying data,  SCK remains low for Mode 0; while in Mode 3, SCK is high. The \nmemory determines the mode of operation (Mode 0 or Mode 3) based upon the state of the SCK when CS \nfalls.\nAll memory transactions start when CS is brought low to the memory. The first byte is a command code. De -\npending upon the command, subsequent bytes of address are input. Data is either input or output. There \nis only one command performed per CS active period. CS must go inactive before another command can \nbe accepted. To ensure proper part operation according to specifications, it is necessary to terminate each \naccess by raising CS at the end of a byte (a multiple of 8 clock cycles from CS dropping) to avoid partial or \naborted accesses.\nStatus Register and Block Write Protection\nThe status register consists of the 8 bits listed in table 2.2. Status register bits BP0 and BP1 define the mem -\nory block arrays that are protected as described in table 2.3. The Status Register Write Disable bit (SRWD) \nis used in conjunction with bit 1 (WEL) and the Write Protection pin ( WP) as shown in table 2.4 to  enable \nwrites to status register bits. The fast writing speed of MR25H10 does not require write status bits. The \nstate of bits 6,5,4, and 0 can be user modified and do not affect memory operation.  All bits in the status \nregister are pre-set from the factory to the “0” state.\nBit 7 Bit 6 Bit 5 Bit 4 Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0\nSRWD Don’t Care Don’t Care Don’t Care BP1 BP0 WEL Don’t CareTable 2.2 Status Register Bit Assignments\n5\nCopyright © Everspin Technologies 2018 MR25H10 Rev. 9.5 3/2018MR25H10SPI COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL\nFigure 2.1 RDSRWEL SRWD WP Protected Blocks Unprotected BlocksStatus \nRegister\n0 X X Protected Protected Protected\n1 0 X Protected Writable Writable\n1 1 Low Protected Writable Protected\n1 1 High Protected Writable WritableTable 2.4 Memory Protection ModesStatus Register Memory Contents\nBP1 BP0 Protected Area Unprotected Area\n0 0 None All Memory\n0 1 Upper Quarter Lower Three-Quarters \n1 0 Upper Half Lower Half\n1 1 All NoneTable 2.3 Block Memory Write Protection\nRead Status Register (RDSR)\nThe Read Status Register (RDSR) command allows the Status Register to be read. The Status Register can \nbe read at any time to check the status of write enable latch bit, status register write protect bit, and block \nwrite protect bits. For MR25H10, the write in progress bit (bit 0) is not written by the memory because \nthere is no write delay.  The RDSR command is entered by driving CS low, sending the command code, and \nthen driving CS high.When WEL is reset to 0, writes to all blocks and the status register are protected. When WEL is set to 1, \nBP0 and BP1 determine which memory blocks are protected. While SRWD is reset to 0 and WEL is set to 1, \nstatus register bits BP0 and BP1 can be modified. Once SRWD is set to 1, WP must be high to modify SRWD, \nBP0 and BP1. \nSCK\nSI\nSOCS\nStatus Register Out\nHigh Impedance High ZMode 3\nMode 01 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\nMSBMSB\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n6\nCopyright © Everspin Technologies 2018 MR25H10 Rev. 9.5 3/2018MR25H10SPI COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL\nFigure 2.3 WRDIFigure 2.2 WRENWrite Enable (WREN)\nThe Write Enable (WREN) command sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the status register to 1. The \nWEL bit must be set prior to writing in the status register or the memory. The WREN command is entered \nby driving CS low, sending the command code, and then driving CS high.\nWrite Disable (WRDI)\nThe Write Disable (WRDI) command resets the WEL bit in the status register to 0. This prevents writes to \nstatus register or memory. The WRDI command is entered by driving CS low, sending the command code, \nand then driving CS high.\nThe WEL bit is reset to 0 on power-up or completion of WRDI.\nWrite Status Register (WRSR)\nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) command allows new values to be written to the Status Register.  The \nWRSR command is not executed unless the Write Enable Latch (WEL) has been set to 1 by executing a \nWREN command while pin WP and bit SRWD correspond to values that make the status register writable \nas seen in table 2.4.

The entire memory can be \nwritten in a single command. The address counter will roll over to 0000h when the address reaches the top \nof memory. \nUnlike EEPROM or Flash Memory, MRAM can write data bytes continuously at its maximum rated clock \nspeed without write delays or data polling. Back to back WRITE commands to any random location in mem -\nory can be executed without write delay. MRAM is a random access memory rather than a page, sector, or \nblock organized memory so it is ideal for both program and data storage. \nThe WRITE command is entered by driving CS low, sending the command code, and then sequential write \ndata bytes. Writes continue as long as the memory is clocked.
