General description\nThe 74LVC1G07 is a single buffer with open-drain output. Inputs can be driven from either 3.3 V\nor 5 V devices. This feature allows the use of these devices as translators in mixed 3.3 V and 5 V\nenvironments. Schmitt-trigger action at all inputs makes the circuit tolerant of slower input rise and\nfall times. This device is fully specified for partial power down applications using I OFF. The I OFF\ncircuitry disables the output, preventing the potentially damaging backflow current through the\ndevice when it is powered down.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range from 1.65 V to 5.5 V\n•Overvoltage tolerant inputs to 5.5 V\n•High noise immunity\n•CMOS low power consumption\n•IOFF circuitry provides partial Power-down mode operation\n•-24 mA output drive (V CC = 3.0 V)\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 250 mA\n•Direct interface with TTL levels\n•Complies with JEDEC standard:\n•JESD8-7 (1.65 V to 1.95 V)\n•JESD8-5 (2.3 V to 2.7 V)\n•JESD8C (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•JESD36 (4.5 V to 5.5 V)\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM: ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-001 Class 2 exceeds 2000 V\n•MM: JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\nNexperia 74LVC1G07\nBuffer with open-drain output\n3.

### Component Summary: 74LVC1G07GV,125

**General Description:**
The 74LVC1G07 is a single buffer with an open-drain output designed for use in mixed voltage environments. It can interface with both 3.3 V and 5 V devices, making it suitable for voltage level translation. The device features Schmitt-trigger inputs, which enhance its tolerance to slower input signal transitions. It is also equipped with I_OFF circuitry that disables the output during power-down conditions, preventing backflow current.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (V_CC): 1.65 V to 5.5 V
  - Input Voltage (V_I): -0.5 V to 6.5 V
  - Output Voltage (V_O): -0.5 V to 6.5 V (active mode)
  
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Drive Current: -24 mA (at V_CC = 3.0 V)
  - Input Clamping Current: -50 mA
  - Supply Current (I_CC): 100 mA maximum

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Total Power Dissipation: 
    - 250 mW for SOT353-1 (TSSOP5)
    - 150 mW for SOT1269-2 (X2SON4)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +125 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - SC-74A (SOT753), 5 leads
  - Other package options include TSSOP5, XSON6, and X2SON4.

- **Special Features:**
  - Overvoltage tolerant inputs up to 5.5 V
  - High noise immunity
  - CMOS low power consumption
  - ESD protection: HBM Class 2 (exceeds 2000 V), MM (exceeds 200 V)
  - Complies with JEDEC standards for various voltage ranges.

- **Moisture Sensitive Level:**
  - MSL Level 1 (JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The 74LVC1G07 is commonly used in:
- **Voltage Level Translation:** It allows devices operating at different voltage levels to communicate effectively, making it ideal for mixed-voltage systems.
- **Signal Buffering:** It can be used to buffer signals in digital circuits, ensuring signal integrity and reducing loading effects on previous stages.
- **Power Management:** The device's ability to disable outputs during power-down conditions makes it suitable for power-sensitive applications.

This component is particularly useful in applications where devices with different voltage levels need to interface, such as in microcontroller and sensor applications, as well as in communication interfaces where signal integrity is critical.
