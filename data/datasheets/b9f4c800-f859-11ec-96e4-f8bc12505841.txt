The device is two-wire-\nand SMBus-interface compatible, and is specified over a temperature range of –40°C to 125°C.

Temperature data that\nresult from conversions within the default measurement range are represented in binary form, as shown in\nthe Standard Binary  column of Table 7-1 . Any temperature below 0°C results in a data value of 0 (00h).\nLikewise, temperatures above 127°C result in a value of 127 (7Fh). The device can be set to measure over an\nextended temperature range by changing bit 2 (RANGE) of configuration register from low to high. The change\nin measurement range and data format from standard binary to extended binary occurs at the next temperature\nconversion. For data captured in the extended temperature range configuration, an offset of 64 (40h) is added to\nthe standard binary value, as shown in the EXTENDED BINARY  column of Table 7-1 . This configuration allows\nmeasurement of temperatures as low as –64°C, and as high as 191°C; however, most temperature-sensing\ndiodes only measure with the range of –55°C to 150°C. Additionally, the TMP451-Q1 is specified only for\nambient temperatures ranging from –40°C to 125°C; parameters in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  table must\nbe observed.www.ti.comTMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\nTable 7-1.

A total of up to\n1 kΩ of series resistance can be cancelled by the TMP451-Q1 device, eliminating the need for additional\ncharacterization and temperature offset correction. See Figure 6-5 , Remote Temperature Error vs. Series\nResistance , for details on the effects of series resistance on sensed remote temperature error.\n7.3.3 Differential Input Capacitance\nThe TMP451-Q1 device tolerates differential input capacitance of up to 1000 pF with minimal change in\ntemperature error. The effect of capacitance on sensed remote temperature error is shown in Figure 6-6 ,\nRemote Temperature Error vs. Differential Capacitance .\n7.3.4 Filtering\nRemote junction temperature sensors are usually implemented in a noisy environment. Noise is most often\ncreated by fast digital signals, and it can corrupt measurements. The TMP451-Q1 device has a built-in, 65-\nkHz filter on the inputs of D+ and D– to minimize the effects of noise. However, a bypass capacitor placed\ndifferentially across the inputs of the remote temperature sensor is recommended to make the application\nmore robust against unwanted coupled signals. For this capacitor, select a value of between 100 pF and 1\nnF. Some applications attain better overall accuracy with additional series resistance; however, this increased\naccuracy is application-specific. When series resistance is added, the total value should not be greater than 1\nkΩ. If filtering is required, suggested component values are 100 pF and 50 Ω on each input; exact values are\napplication-specific.www.ti.comTMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\nAdditionally, a digital filter is available for the remote temperature measurements to further reduce the effect of\nnoise. This filter is programmable and has two levels when enabled. Level 1 performs a moving average of four\nconsecutive samples. Level 2 performs a moving average of eight consecutive samples. The value stored in\nthe remote temperature result register is the output of the digital filter, and the ALERT  and THERM  limits are\ncompared to it. This provides additional immunity to noise and spikes on the ALERT  and THERM  outputs. The\nfilter responses are shown in Figure 7-1 . The filter can be enabled or disabled by programming the desired levels\nin the digital filter register.

The\nTMP451-Q1 device can also sense an open circuit. Short-circuit conditions return a value of –64°C. The\ndetection circuitry consists of a voltage comparator that trips when the voltage at D+ exceeds (V+) – 0.3 V\n(typical). The comparator output is continuously checked during a conversion. If a fault is detected, then OPEN\n(bit 2) in the status register is set to 1.\nWhen not using the remote sensor with the TMP451-Q1 device, the D+ and D– inputs must be connected\ntogether to prevent meaningless fault warnings.TMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\n7.3.6 ALERT and THERM Functions\nThe operation of the ALERT  (pin 6) and THERM  (pin 4) interrupts is shown in Figure 7-2 .

Shutdown mode is enabled when the SD bit (bit 6) of the\nconfiguration register is high; the device shuts down after the current conversion is finished. When the SD bit is\nlow, the device maintains a continuous-conversion state.\n7.5 Programming\n7.5.1 Serial Interface\nThe TMP451-Q1 device operates only as a slave device on either the two-wire bus or the SMBus. Connections\nto either bus are made using the open-drain I/O lines, SDA and SCL. The SDA and SCL pins feature integrated\nspike suppression filters and Schmitt triggers to minimize the effects of input spikes and bus noise. The\nTMP451-Q1 device supports the transmission protocol for fast (1 kHz to 400 kHz) and high-speed (1 kHz to\n2.5 MHz) modes. All data bytes are transmitted MSB first.\n7.5.1.1 Bus Overview\nThe TMP451-Q1 device is SMBus interface compatible. In SMBus protocol, the device that initiates the transfer\nis called a master , and the devices controlled by the master are slaves . The bus must be controlled by a\nmaster device that generates the serial clock (SCL), controls the bus access, and generates the start and stop\nconditions.\nTo address a specific device, a start condition is initiated. A start condition is indicated by pulling the data line\n(SDA) from a high-to-low logic level while SCL is high. All slaves on the bus shift in the slave address byte, with\nthe last bit indicating whether a read or write operation is intended. During the ninth clock pulse, the slave being\naddressed responds to the master by generating an acknowledge  bit and pulling SDA low.\nData transfer is then initiated and sent over eight clock pulses followed by an acknowledge bit. During data\ntransfer SDA must remain stable while SCL is high, because any change in SDA while SCL is high is interpreted\nas a control signal.\nAfter all data have been transferred, the master generates a stop condition. A stop condition is indicated by\npulling SDA from low to high, while SCL is high.\n7.5.1.2 Bus Definitions\nThe TMP451-Q1 device is two-wire and SMBus-compatible. Figure 7-4  and Figure 7-5  show the timing for\nvarious operations on the TMP451-Q1 device. The bus definitions are as follows:\nBus Idle: Both SDA and SCL lines remain high.\nStart Data\nTransfer:A change in the state of the SDA line, from high to low, while the SCL line is high, defines\na start condition. Each data transfer initiates with a start condition.\nStop Data\nTransfer:A change in the state of the SDA line from low to high while the SCL line is high defines a\nstop condition. Each data transfer terminates with a repeated start or stop condition.\nData Transfer: The number of data bytes transferred between a start and a stop condition is not limited\nand is determined by the master device. The receiver acknowledges data transfer.\nAcknowledge: Each receiving device, when addressed, is obliged to generate an acknowledge bit. A\ndevice that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock\npulse in such a way that the SDA line is stable low during the high period of the\nacknowledge clock pulse. Take setup and hold times into account. On a master receive,\ndata transfer termination can be signaled by the master generating a not-acknowledge on\nthe last byte that has been transmitted by the slave.TMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\nFrame 1 Two-Wire Slave Address Byte Frame 2 Pointer Register Byte1\nStart By\nMasterACK By\nDeviceACK By\nDevice1 9 1\nFrame 3 Data Byte 1ACK By\nDevice1\nD7SDA\n(Continued)SCL\n(Continued)\nD6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D099\nSDASCL\n0 0 1 1 0 0(1)R/W P7 P6 P5 P4 P3 P2 P1 P0 /c188/c188\nStop By\nMasterA.

The slave address byte consists of seven address bits, and a direction bit indicating the intent\nof executing a read or write operation. The TMP451-Q1 SMBus addresses are shown in Table 7-3 . Additional\nfactory-programmed device addresses are available upon request.\nTable 7-3. TMP451-Q1 SMBus Addresses\nOrderable Part Number (DQF Package) SMBus Address (7-bit)\nTMP451HQDQFRQ1 49\nTMP451AQDQFRQ1 4C\nTMP451JQDQFRQ1 4E\n7.5.1.4 Read and Write Operations\nAccessing a particular register on the TMP451-Q1 device is accomplished by writing the appropriate value to the\npointer register. The value for the pointer register is the first byte transferred after the slave address byte with the\nR/ W bit low. Every write operation to the TMP451-Q1 device requires a value for the pointer register (see Figure\n7-4).\nWhen reading from the TMP451-Q1 device the last value stored in the pointer register by a write operation\nis used to determine which register is read by a read operation. To change which register is read for a read\noperation, a new value must be written to the pointer register. This transaction is accomplished by issuing a\nslave address byte with the R/ W bit low, followed by the pointer register byte; no additional data are required.\nThe master can then generate a start condition and send the slave address byte with the R/ W bit high to initiate\nthe read command; see Figure 7-5  for details of this sequence.\nIf repeated reads from the same register are desired, it is not necessary to continually send the pointer register\nbytes, because the TMP451-Q1 retains the pointer register value until it is changed by the next write operation.\nThe register bytes are sent MSB first, followed by the LSB.\nRead operations should be terminated by issuing a not-acknowledge  command at the end of the last byte to be\nread. For single-byte operation, the master must leave the SDA line high during the acknowledge time of the first\nbyte that is read from the slave.\n7.5.1.5 Timeout Function\nIf the SMBus timeout function is enabled, the TMP451-Q1 device resets the serial interface if either SCL or SDA\nare held low for 25 ms (typical) between a start and stop condition. If the TMP451-Q1 device is holding the\nbus low, the device releases the bus and waits for a start condition. To avoid activating the timeout function,\nmaintaining a communication speed of at least 1 kHz for the SCL operating frequency is necessary. The SMBTO\nbit (bit 7) of the consecutive ALERT  register controls the timeout enable. Setting the SMBTO bit to a value of 0\n(default) disables the timeout. Setting the SMBTO bit to a value of 1 enables the function.\n7.5.1.6 High-Speed Mode\nFor the two-wire bus to operate at frequencies above 1 MHz, the master device must issue a high-speed mode\n(Hs-mode) master code (0000 1xxx) as the first byte after a start condition to switch the bus to high-speed\noperation. The TMP451-Q1 device does not acknowledge this byte, but switches the input filters on SDA and\nSCL and the output filter on SDA to operate in Hs-mode, allowing transfers at up to 2.5 MHz. After the Hs-mode\nmaster code has been issued, the master transmits a two-wire slave address to initiate a data transfer operation.\nThe bus continues to operate in Hs-mode until a stop condition occurs on the bus. Upon receiving the stop\ncondition, the TMP451-Q1 device switches the input and output filters back to fast mode operation.TMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\n7.6 Register Map\nTable 7-4.

These registers are described in Figure 7-6  and Table 7-4 .\n7.6.1.1 Pointer Register\nFigure 7-6  shows the internal register structure of the TMP451-Q1 device. The 8-bit pointer register is used to\naddress a given data register. The pointer register identifies which of the data registers should respond to a read\nor write command on the two-wire bus. This register is set with every write command. A write command must be\nissued to set the proper value in the pointer register before executing a read command. Table 7-4  describes the\npointer register and the internal structure of the TMP451-Q1 registers. The power-on reset (POR) value of the\npointer register is 00h (0000 0000b).\nLocal and Remote Temperature Registers\nI/O \nControl \nInterfacePointer Register\nConfiguration RegisterStatus Register\nLocal and Remote Temperature Limit RegistersConversion Rate Register\nRemote Temperature Offset RegistersOne-Shot Start Register\nLocal and Remote THERM Limit Registers\nTHERM Hysteresis Register\nN-factor Correction RegisterConsecutive ALERT Register\nDigital Filter Register\nManufacturer ID RegisterSDA\nSCL\nFigure 7-6. Internal Register Structure\n7.6.1.2 Temperature Registers\nThe TMP451-Q1 device has multiple 8-bit registers that hold temperature measurement results. The eight most\nsignificant bits (MSBs) of the local temperature sensor result are stored in register 00h, while the four least\nsignificant bits (LSBs) are stored in register 15h (the four MSBs of register 15h). The eight MSBs of the remote\ntemperature sensor result are stored in register 01h, and the four LSBs are stored in register 10h (the four MSBs\nof register 10h). The four LSBs of both the local sensor and the remote sensor indicate the temperature value\nafter the decimal point (for example, if the temperature result is 10.0625°C, the high byte is 0000 1010 and the\nlow byte is 0001 0000). These registers are read-only and are updated by the ADC each time a temperature\nmeasurement is completed.\nWhen the full temperature value is needed, reading the MSB value first causes the LSB value to be locked (the\nADC does not write to it) until it is read. The same thing happens upon reading the LSB value first (the MSB\nvalue is locked until it is read). This mechanism assures that both bytes of the read operation are from the same\nADC conversion. This assurance remains valid only until another register is read. For proper operation, read theTMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\nhigh byte of the temperature result first. Read the low byte register in the next read command; if the LSBs are\nnot needed, the register may be left unread. The power-on reset value of all temperature registers is 00h.\n7.6.1.3 Status Register\nThe status register reports the state of the temperature ADC, the temperature limit comparators, and the\nconnection to the remote sensor. Table 7-5  lists the status register bits. The status register is read-only, and is\nread by accessing pointer address 02h.\nTable 7-5. Status Register Format\nSTATUS REGISTER (READ = 02h, WRITE = N/A)\nBIT NUMBER BIT NAME FUNCTION\n7 BUSY = 1 when the ADC is converting\n6 LHIGH(1)= 1 when the local high temperature limit is tripped\n5 LLOW(1)= 1 when the local low temperature limit is tripped\n4 RHIGH(1)= 1 when the remote high temperature limit is tripped\n3 RLOW(1)= 1 when the remote low temperature limit is tripped\n2 OPEN(1)= 1 when the remote sensor is an open circuit\n1 RTHRM = 1 when the remote THERM limit is tripped\n0 LTHRM = 1 when the local THERM limit is tripped\n(1) These flags stay high until the status register is read or they are reset by a POR when pin 6 is\nconfigured as ALERT. Only bit 2 (OPEN) stays high until the status register is read or it is reset by a\nPOR when pin 6 is configured as THERM2.\nThe BUSY bit = 1 if the ADC is making a conversion. This bit is set to 0 if the ADC is not converting.\nThe LHIGH and LLOW bits indicate a local sensor overtemperature or undertemperature event, respectively.\nThe RHIGH and RLOW bits indicate a remote sensor overtemperature or undertemperature event, respectively.\nThe OPEN bit indicates an open circuit condition on the remote sensor. When pin 6 is configured as the ALERT\noutput, the five flags are NORed together. If any of the five flags are high, the ALERT  interrupt latch is set and\nthe ALERT  output goes low. Reading the status register clears the five flags, provided that the condition that\ncaused the setting of the flags is not present anymore (that is, the value of the corresponding result register is\nwithin the limits, or the remote sensor is connected properly and functional). The ALERT  interrupt latch (and the\nALERT  pin correspondingly) is not reset by reading the status register. The reset is done by the master reading\nthe temperature sensor device address to service the interrupt, and only if the flags have been reset and the\ncondition that caused them to be set is not present.\nThe RTHRM and LTHRM flags are set when the corresponding temperature exceeds the programmed THERM\nlimit. They are reset automatically when the temperature returns to within the limits. The THERM  output goes\nlow in the case of overtemperature on either the local or the remote channel, and goes high as soon as the\nmeasurements are within the limits again. The THERM  hysteresis register (21h) allows hysteresis to be added\nso that the flag resets and the output goes high when the temperature returns to or goes below the limit value\nminus the hysteresis value.\nWhen pin 6 is configured as THERM2 , only the high limits matter. The LHIGH and RHIGH flags are set if the\nrespective temperatures exceed the limit values, and the pin goes low to indicate the event. The LLOW and\nRLOW flags have no effect on THERM2, and the output behaves the same way when configured as THERM.www.ti.comTMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\n7.6.1.4 Configuration Register\nThe configuration register sets the temperature range, the ALERT / THERM  modes, and controls the shutdown\nmode. The configuration register is set by writing to pointer address 09h, and read by reading from pointer\naddress 03h. Table 7-6  summarizes the bits of configuration register.\nTable 7-6. Configuration Register Bit Descriptions\nCONFIGURATION REGISTER (READ = 03h, WRITE = 09h, POR = 00h)\nBIT NUMBER NAME FUNCTION POWER-ON RESET VALUE\n7 MASK10 = ALERT Enabled\n1 = ALERT Masked0\n6 SD0 = Run\n1 = Shut down0\n5 ALERT/ THERM20 = ALERT\n1 = THERM20\n4:3 Reserved — 0\n2 RANGE0 = 0°C to +127°C\n1 = –64°C to +191°C0\n1:0 Reserved — 0\nMASK1 (bit 7) of the configuration register masks the ALERT  output. If MASK1 is 0 (default), the ALERT  output\nis enabled. If MASK1 is set to 1, the ALERT  output is disabled. This configuration applies only if the value of\nALERT / THERM2  (bit 5) is 0 (that is, pin 6 is configured as the ALERT  output). If pin 6 is configured as the\nTHERM2 output, the value of the MASK1 bit has no effect.\nThe shutdown bit (SD, bit 6) enables or disables the temperature-measurement circuitry. If SD = 0 (default), the\nTMP451-Q1 device converts continuously at the rate set in the conversion rate register. When SD is set to 1, the\nTMP451-Q1 device stops converting when the current conversion sequence is complete and enters a shutdown\nmode. When SD is set to 0 again, the TMP451-Q1 resumes continuous conversions. When SD = 1, a single\nconversion can be started by writing to the one-shot start register. See the One-Shot Start Register  section for\nmore information.\nALERT / THERM2  (bit 5) sets the configuration of pin 6. If the ALERT / THERM2  bit is 0 (default), then pin 6 is\nconfigured as the ALERT output; if it is set to 1, then pin 6 is configured as the THERM2 output.\nThe temperature range is set by configuring RANGE (bit 2) of the configuration register. Setting this bit low\n(default) configures the TMP451-Q1 device for the standard measurement range (0°C to 127°C); temperature\nconversions are stored in the standard binary format. Setting bit 2 high configures the TMP451-Q1 device for\nthe extended measurement range (–64°C to 191°C); temperature conversions are stored in the extended binary\nformat (see Table 7-1 ).\nThe remaining bits of the configuration register are reserved and must always be set to 0. The power-on reset\nvalue for this register is 00h.TMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\n7.6.1.5 Conversion Rate Register\nThe conversion rate register (read address 04h, write address 0Ah) controls the rate at which temperature\nconversions are performed. This register adjusts the idle time between conversions but not the conversion time\nitself, thereby allowing the TMP451-Q1 power dissipation to be balanced with the temperature register update\nrate. Table 7-7  lists the conversion rate options and corresponding time between conversions. The default value\nof the register is 08h, which gives a default rate of 16 conversions per second.\nTable 7-7.

This write operation starts one\nconversion and comparison cycle on both the local and the remote sensors. The TMP451-Q1 device returns to\nshutdown mode when the cycle completes. The value of the data sent in the write command is irrelevant and is\nnot stored by the TMP451-Q1 device.\n7.6.1.7 η-Factor Correction Register\nThe TMP451-Q1 device allows for a different η-factor value to be used for converting remote channel\nmeasurements to temperature. The remote channel uses sequential current excitation to extract a differential\nVBE voltage measurement to determine the temperature of the remote transistor. Equation 1  shows this voltage\nand temperature.\n= V VBE2 BE1/c45/c104kT\nqlnI2\nI1\n(1)\nThe value η in Equation 1  is a characteristic of the particular transistor used for the remote channel. The\npower-on reset value for the TMP451-Q1 device is η = 1.008. The value in the η-factor correction register may\nbe used to adjust the effective η-factor according to Equation 2  and Equation 3 .\neff\nADJUST1.008 2088\x182088 N§ · u ¨ ¸ \x0e© ¹ \n(2)\nADJUST\neff1.008 2088N 2088\x18§ · u \x10 ¨ ¸ \n© ¹ \n(3)\nThe η-factor correction value must be stored in twos complement format, yielding an effective data range from\n–128 to 127. The η-factor correction value is written to and read from pointer address 23h. The register power-on\nreset value is 00h, thus having no effect unless a different value is written to it.www.ti.comTMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\nTable 7-8. η-Factor Range\nNADJUST\nη BINARY HEX DECIMAL\n0111 1111 7F 127 0.950198\n0000 1010 0A 10 1.003195\n0000 1000 08 8 1.004152\n0000 0110 06 6 1.005111\n0000 0100 04 4 1.006072\n0000 0010 02 2 1.007035\n0000 0001 01 1 1.007517\n0000 0000 00 0 1.008\n1111 1111 FF –1 1.008483\n1111 1110 FE –2 1.008967\n1111 1100 FC –4 1.009935\n1111 1010 FA –6 1.010905\n1111 1000 F8 –8 1.011877\n1111 0110 F6 –10 1.012851\n1000 0000 80 –128 1.073837\n7.6.1.8 Offset Register\nThe offset register allows the TMP451-Q1 device to store any system offset compensation value that might be\nobserved from precision calibration. The value in the register is stored in the same format as the temperature\nresult, and is added to the remote temperature result upon every conversion. Combined with the η-factor\ncorrection, this function allows for very accurate system calibration over the entire temperature range.\n7.6.1.9 General Call Reset\nThe TMP451-Q1 device supports reset using the two-wire general call address 00h (0000 0000b). The TMP451-\nQ1 device acknowledges the general call address and responds to the second byte. If the second byte is 06h\n(0000 0110b), the TMP451-Q1 device executes a software reset. This software reset restores the power-on\nreset state to all TMP451-Q1 registers, and it aborts any conversion in progress. The TMP451-Q1 device takes\nno action in response to other values in the second byte.\n7.6.1.10 Identification Register\nThe TMP451-Q1 device allows for the two-wire bus controller to query the device for manufacturer and device\nIDs to enable software identification of the device at the particular two-wire bus address. The manufacturer ID is\nobtained by reading from pointer address FEh. The TMP451-Q1 device reads 55h for the manufacturer code.TMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification,\nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

Tie the D+ pin to GND if the remote channel is not used and only the local\ntemperature is measured. The SDA, ALERT, and THERM pins (and SCL, if driven by an open-drain output)\nrequire pullup resistors as part of the communication bus.

TMP451-Q1 Basic Connections Using a Processor Built-In Remote Transistor\n8.2.1 Design Requirements\nThe TMP451-Q1 device is designed to be used with either discrete transistors or substrate transistors built into\nprocessor chips and ASICs. Either NPN or PNP transistors can be used, as long as the base-emitter junction is\nused as the remote temperature sense. NPN transistors must be diode-connected. PNP transistors can either be\ntransistor- or diode-connected (see Figure 8-1 ).\nErrors in remote temperature sensor readings are typically the consequence of the ideality factor and current\nexcitation used by the TMP451-Q1 device versus the manufacturer-specified operating current for a given\ntransistor. Some manufacturers specify a high-level and low-level current for the temperature-sensing substrate\ntransistors. The TMP451-Q1 device uses 7.5 μA for I LOW and 120 μA for I HIGH.\nThe ideality factor ( η) is a measured characteristic of a remote temperature sensor diode as compared to an\nideal diode. The TMP451-Q1 allows for different η-factor values; see the η-Factor Correction Register  section.\nThe ideality factor for the TMP451-Q1 device is trimmed to be 1.008. For transistors that have an ideality factor\nthat does not match the TMP451-Q1, Equation 4  can be used to calculate the temperature error.\nNote\nFor the equation to be used correctly, actual temperature (°C) must be converted to Kelvin (K).\nT =ERR/c1041.008/c45\n1.008(273.15□+□T( C)) /c176 /c180\n(4)\nwhere\n• T ERR = error in the TMP451-Q1 device because η ≠ 1.008\n• η = ideality factor of remote temperature sensor\n• T(°C) = actual temperature\n• Degree delta is the same for °C and K.\nFor η = 1.004 and T(°C) = 100°C:TMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\nERR\nERR1.004 1.008T 273.15 100 C1.008\nT 1.48 C/c45 /c230 /c246/c61 /c180 /c43 /c176/c231 /c247/c232 /c248\n/c61 /c176(5)\nIf a discrete transistor is used as the remote temperature sensor with the TMP451-Q1, the best accuracy can be\nachieved by selecting the transistor according to the following criteria:\n1. Base-emitter voltage > 0.25 V at 7.5 μA, at the highest sensed temperature.\n2. Base-emitter voltage < 0.95 V at 120 μA, at the lowest sensed temperature.\n3. Base resistance < 100 Ω.\n4. Tight control of V BE characteristics indicated by small variations in h FE (that is, 50 to 150).\nBased on this criteria, two recommended small-signal transistors are the 2N3904 (NPN) or 2N3906 (PNP).\n8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nThe local temperature sensor inside the TMP451-Q1 device monitors the ambient air around the device. The\nthermal time constant for the TMP451-Q1 device is approximately two seconds. This constant implies that if\nthe ambient air changes quickly by 100°C, it would take the TMP451-Q1 device about 10 seconds (that is, five\nthermal time constants) to settle to within 1°C of the final value. In most applications, the TMP451-Q1 package\nis in electrical, and therefore thermal, contact with the printed circuit board (PCB), as well as subjected to forced\nairflow. The accuracy of the measured temperature directly depends on how accurately the PCB and forced\nairflow temperatures represent the temperature that the TMP451-Q1 is measuring. Additionally, the internal\npower dissipation of the TMP451-Q1 can cause the temperature to rise above the ambient or PCB temperature.\nThe internal power dissipated as a result of exciting the remote temperature sensor is negligible because of\nthe small currents used. For a 3.3-V supply and maximum conversion rate of 16 conversions per second, the\nTMP451-Q1 device dissipates 0.54 mW (PD IQ = 3.3 V × 165 μA). A θJA of 171.3°C/W causes the junction\ntemperature to rise approximately 0.09°C above the ambient.\nThe temperature measurement accuracy of the TMP451-Q1 device depends on the remote and/or local\ntemperature sensor being at the same temperature as the system point being monitored. Clearly, if the\ntemperature sensor is not in good thermal contact with the part of the system being monitored, then there\nwill be a delay in the response of the sensor to a temperature change in the system. For remote temperature-\nsensing applications using a substrate transistor (or a small, SOT23 transistor) placed close to the device being\nmonitored, this delay is usually not a concern.\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nThe following curves show the performance capabilities of the TMP451-Q1 device. Figure 8-3  shows the\naccuracy performance in an oil-bath temperature drift of a population of 16 standard 2N3906 transistors\nmeasured in a diode-connected configuration. Figure 8-4  shows the typical step response to a submerging\nof a sensor in an oil bath with temperature of 100°C.www.ti.comTMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\nRemote Diode Temperature ( qC)Temperature Error (( qC))\n-40 -25 -10 5 20 35 50 65 80 95 110 125-2-1.5-1-0.500.511.52\nD001Mean\nMean \x10 66\nMean + 66Figure 8-3.

The device is optimized for\noperation at 3.3-V supply but can measure temperature accurately in the full supply range.\nA power-supply bypass capacitor is recommended. Place this capacitor as close as possible to the supply and\nground pins of the device. A typical value for this supply bypass capacitor is 0.1 μF. Applications with noisy or\nhigh-impedance power supplies may require additional decoupling capacitors to reject power-supply noise.TMP451-Q1\nSLOS877C – OCTOBER 2014 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMP451-Q1\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nRemote temperature sensing on the TMP451-Q1 device measures very small voltages using very low currents;\ntherefore, noise at the device inputs must be minimized. Most applications using the TMP451-Q1 have high\ndigital content, with several clocks and logic level transitions creating a noisy environment. Layout should adhere\nto the following guidelines:\n1. Place the TMP451-Q1 device as close to the remote junction sensor as possible.\n2. Route the D+ and D– traces next to each other and shield them from adjacent signals through the use of\nground guard traces; see Figure 10-1 . If a multilayer PCB is used, bury these traces between ground or V+\nplanes to shield them from extrinsic noise sources. 5 mil (0.127 mm) PCB traces are recommended.\n3. Minimize additional thermocouple junctions caused by copper-to-solder connections. If these junctions are\nused, make the same number and approximate locations of copper-to-solder connections in both the D+ and\nD– connections to cancel any thermocouple effects.\n4. Use a 0.1μF local bypass capacitor directly between the V+ and GND of the TMP451-Q1 device. For\noptimum measurement performance, minimize filter capacitance between D+ and D– to 1000 pF or less .\nThis capacitance includes any cable capacitance between the remote temperature sensor and the TMP451-\nQ1 device.\n5. If the connection between the remote temperature sensor and the TMP451-Q1 device is less than 8-in\n(20,32 cm) long, use a twisted-wire pair connection. For lengths greater than 8 in, use a twisted, shielded\npair with the shield grounded as close to the TMP451-Q1 device as possible. Leave the remote sensor\nconnection end of the shield wire open to avoid ground loops and 60-Hz pickup.\n6. Thoroughly clean and remove all flux residue in and around the pins of the TMP451-Q1 device to avoid\ntemperature offset readings as a result of leakage paths between D+ and GND, or between D+ and V+.\nV+\nD+\nD/c45\nGNDGround or V+ layer\non bottom and/or\ntop, if possible.\nUse minimum 5-mil (0.127 mm) traces with 5-mil spacing.\nFigure 10-1.
