It has a rail-to-rail output buffer and is guaranteed monotonic.\nThe LTC2630-L has a full-scale output of 2.5V , and  \noperates from a single 2.7V to 5.5V supply. The  \nLTC2630-H has a full-scale output of 4.096V , and oper -\nates from a 4.5V to 5.5V supply. Each DAC can also oper -\nate in supply as reference mode, which sets the full-scale output to the supply voltage.\nThe parts use a simple SPI/MICROWIRE™  compatible \n3-wire serial interface which operates at clock rates up to 50MHz.\nThe LTC2630 incorporates a power-on reset circuit. \nOptions are available for reset to zero or reset to mid-\nscale after power-up.\nL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks of Analog \nDevices, Inc.

Each DAC can operate rail-to-rail \nreferenced to the input supply, or with its full-scale voltage \nset by an integrated reference. T welve combinations of \naccuracy ( 12-, 10-, and 8-bit), power-on reset value (zero \nor mid-scale), and full-scale voltage (2.5V or 4.096V) are available. The LTC2630 is controlled using a 3-wire SPI/\nMICROWIRE compatible interface.\nPower-On ResetThe LTC2630-HZ/-LZ clear the output to zero scale when \npower is first applied, making system initialization con -\nsistent and repeatable.\nFor some applications, downstream circuits are active \nduring DAC power-up, and may be sensitive to nonzero \noutputs from the DAC during this time. The LTC2630 con -\ntains circuitry to reduce the power-on glitch: the analog \noutput typically rises less than 5mV  above zero scale dur -\ning power on if the power supply is ramped to 5V in 1ms \nor more. In general, the glitch amplitude decreases as \nthe power supply ramp time is increased. See “Power-On Reset Glitch” in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nThe LTC2630-HM/-LM provide an alternative reset, set -\nting the output to mid-scale when power is first applied.SDI\nCS/LDSCKt2\nt10\nt5 t7t6t1\nt3 t4\n1 2 3 23 24\n2630 F01\noperation\nT ransfer FunctionThe digital-to-analog transfer function is\n  VOUT(IDEAL) =k\n2N⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟VREF\n \nwhere k is the decimal equivalent of the binary DAC \ninput code, N is the resolution, and V REF is either 2.5V \n(LTC2630-L) or 4.096V ( LTC2630-H) in internal ref -\nerence mode, and V CC in Supply as reference mode.  \nTable 1.

Serial Interface Timing\nLTC263014\n2630fg For more information www.linear.com/LTC2630Serial Interface\nThe CS /LD input is level triggered. When this input is \ntaken low, it acts as a chip-select signal, enabling the SDI \nand SCK buffers and the input shift register. Data (SDI \ninput) is transferred at the next 24 rising SCK edges. The \n4-bit command, C3-C0, is loaded first; then 4 don’t-care \nbits; and finally the 16-bit data word. The data word com -\nprises the 12-, 10- or 8-bit input code, ordered MSB-to-LSB, followed by 4, 6 or 8 don’t-care bits (LTC2630-12, -10 and -8 respectively; see Figure 2). Data can only be transferred to the device when the CS\n/LD signal is low, \nbeginning on the first rising edge of SCK. SCK may be \nhigh or low at the falling edge of CS /LD. The rising edge \nof CS /LD ends the data transfer and causes the device \nto execute the command specified in the 24-bit input \nsequence. The complete sequence is shown in Figure 3a.operation\nThe command (C3- C0) assignments are shown in Table 1. \nThe first three commands in the table consist of write and \nupdate operations. A Write operation loads a 16-bit data \nword from the 24-bit shift register into the input register.  \nIn an Update operation, the input register is copied to \nthe DAC register and converted to an analog voltage at the DAC output. Write to and Update combines the first \ntwo commands. The Update operation also powers up the \nDAC if it had been in power-down mode. The data path and registers are shown in the Block Diagram.\nWhile the minimum input sequence is 24-bits, it may \noptionally be extended to 32-bits to accommodate micro-\nprocessors that have a minimum word width of 16-bits (2 bytes). To use the 32-bit width, 8 don’t-care bits are \ntransferred to the device first, followed by the 24-bit \nsequence described. Figure 3b shows the 32-bit sequence. \nThe 16-bit data word is ignored for all commands that do not include a Write operation.2630 F02C3COMMAND 4 DON'T-CARE BITS\nMSB\nMSB\nMSBLSB\nLSB\nLSBDATA (12 BITS + 4 DON'T-CARE BITS)\nC2 C1 C0 X X X X D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 X X X X\nC3COMMAND 4 DON'T-CARE BITS DATA (10 BITS + 6 DON'T-CARE BITS)\nC2 C1 C0 X X X X D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 X X X X X X\nC3COMMANDINPUT WORD (L TC2630-12)\nINPUT WORD (L TC2630-10)\nINPUT WORD (L TC2630-8)\n4 DON'T-CARE BITS DATA (8 BITS + 8 DON'T-CARE BITS)\nC2 C1 C0 X X X X D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 X X X X X X X X\nFigure 2.

When in power-down, the buf -\nfer amplifier, bias circuit, and reference circuit are dis -\nabled and draw essentially zero current. The DAC output \nis put into a high-impedance state, and the output pin \nis passively pulled to ground through a 200kΩ resistor. Input and DAC register contents are not disturbed during power-down.\nThe DAC can be put into power-down mode by using \ncommand 0100. The supply current is reduced to 1.8µA maximum when the DAC is powered down.\nNormal operation resumes after executing any command \nthat includes a DAC update, as shown in Table 1. The DAC \nis powered up and its voltage output is updated. Normal \nsettling is delayed while the bias, reference, and amplifier circuits are re-enabled. The power-up delay time is 18µs for settling to 12-bits.\nReference Modes\nFor applications where an accurate external reference is \nnot available, the LTC2630 has a user-selectable, inte -\ngrated reference. The LTC2630-LM and LTC2630-LZ pro -\nvide a full-scale output of 2.5 V. The LTC2630 -HM and \nLTC2630-HZ provide a full-scale output of 4.096V.\nThe internal reference can be useful in applications where \nthe supply voltage is poorly regulated. Internal Reference \nmode can be selected by using command 0110, and is the power-on default.\nThe DAC can also operate in supply as reference mode \nusing command 0111. In this mode, V CC supplies the \nDAC’s reference voltage and the supply current is reduced.Voltage OutputThe LTC2630’s integrated rail-to-rail amplifier has guar -\nanteed load regulation when sourcing or sinking up to \n10mA at 5V, and 5mA at 3V.Load regulation is a measure of the amplifier’s ability to \nmaintain the rated voltage accuracy over a wide range of load current. The measured change in output voltage per change in forced load current is expressed in LSB/mA.\nDC output impedance is equivalent to load regulation, and \nmay be derived from it by simply calculating a change in units from LSB/mA to ohms. The amplifier’s DC output impedance is 0.1Ω when driving a load well away from the rails.\nWhen drawing a load current from either rail, the output \nvoltage headroom with respect to that rail is limited by the 50Ω typical channel resistance of the output devices \n(e.g., when sinking 1mA, the minimum output voltage \nis 50Ω • 1mA, or 50mV). See the graph “Headroom at \nRails vs. Output Current”  in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section.\nThe amplifier is stable driving capacitive loads of up to \n500pF.\nRail-to-Rail Output Considerations\nIn any rail-to-rail voltage output device, the output is lim -\nited to voltages within the supply range.\nSince the analog output of the DAC cannot go below \nground, it may limit for the lowest codes as shown in \nFigure 4b. Similarly, limiting can occur near full scale \nwhen using the supply as reference. If V FS = V CC and the \nDAC full-scale error (FSE) is positive, the output for the \nhighest codes limits at V CC, as shown in Figure 4. No \nfull-scale limiting can occur if V FS is less than V CC–FSE. \nOffset and linearity are defined and tested over the region \nof the DAC transfer function where no output limiting can occur .\nLTC263017\n2630fg For more information www.linear.com/LTC2630operation\nBoard Layout\nThe PC board should have separate areas for the analog \nand digital sections of the circuit. A single, solid ground \nplane should be used, with analog and digital signals care -\nfully routed over separate areas of the plane. This keeps \ndigital signals away from sensitive analog signals and \nminimizes the interaction between digital ground currents \nand the analog section of the ground plane. The resistance \nfrom the LTC2630 GND pin to the ground plane should be as low as possible. Resistance here will add directly to \nthe effective DC output impedance of the device (typically \n0.1Ω). Note that the LTC2630 is no more susceptible to \nthis effect than any other parts of this type; on the con -\ntrary, it allows layout-based performance improvements to shine rather than limiting attainable per formance with \nexcessive internal resistance.\nAnother technique for minimizing errors is to use a sepa -\nrate power ground return trace on another board layer . \nThe trace should run between the point where the power \nsupply is connected to the board and the DAC ground pin. \nThus the DAC ground pin becomes the common point for \nanalog ground, digital ground, and power ground. When \nthe LTC2630 is sinking large currents, this current flows \nout the ground pin and directly to the power ground trace \nwithout affecting the analog ground plane voltage.It is sometimes necessary to interrupt the ground plane to confine digital ground currents to the digital portion of \nthe plane. When doing this, make the gap in the plane only \nas long as it needs to be to serve its purpose and ensure that no traces cross over the gap.\nOpto-Isolated 4mA to 20mA Process Controller\nFigure 5 shows how to use an LTC2630Hz to make an \nopto-isolated, digitally-controlled 4mA to 20mA transmit -\nter. The transmitter circuitry, including opto-isolation, is \npowered by the loop voltage which has a wide range of 5.4V to 80V . The 5V output of the LT\n®3010-5 is used to \nset the 4mA offset current and V OUT is used to digitally \ncontrol the 0mA to 16mA signal current. The supply cur -\nrent for the regulator, DAC, and op amp is well below \nthe 4mA budget at zero scale. R S senses the total loop \ncurrent, which includes the quiescent supply current and additional current through Q1. Note that at the maximum loop voltage of 80V, Q1 will dissipate 1.6W when I\nOUT = \n20mA and must have an appropriate heat sink.\nROFFSET  and R GAIN are the closest 0.1% values to ideal \nfor controlling a 4mA to 20mA output as the digital input \nvaries from zero scale to full scale. Alternatively, R OFFSET  \ncan be a 365k, 1% resistor in series with a 20k trim pot and R\nGAIN can be a 75.0k, 1% resistor in series with a 5k \ntrim pot. The opto-isolators shown will limit the speed of the serial bus; the 6N139 is an alternative that will allow higher data rates.\nLTC263018\n2630fg For more information www.linear.com/LTC2630\n2630 F04 \nINPUT CODE\n(b)OUTPUT\nVOL TAGE\nNEGATIVE\nOFFSET0V0V\n2,048 0 4,095\nINPUT CODEOUTPUT\nVOL TAGE\n(a)VREF = VCCVREF = VCC\n(c)INPUT CODEOUTPUT\nVOL TAGEPOSITIVE\nFSEoperation\nFigure 4.
