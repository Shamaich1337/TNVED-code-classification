General description\nCBTL06DP213 is an NXP third generation hi gh-performance multi-ch annel multiplexer, \nmeant for DisplayPort (DP) v1.3 or Embedded DisplayPort applications operating at data \nrate of 1.62 Gbit/s, 2.7 Gbit/s, 5.4 Gbit/s or 8.1 Gbit/s. It is designed using NXP proprietary \nhigh-bandwidth pass-gate technology and it  can be used for 1 : 2 switching or 2 : 1 \nmultiplexing of four high-speed differential AC -coupled DP channels. Further, it is capable \nof switching/multiplexing of Hot Plug Detect (HPD) signal as well as Auxiliary (AUX) and \nDisplay Data Channel (DDC) signals. In order to support GPUs/CPUs that have dedicated \nAUX and DDC I/Os, CBTL06DP213 provides an additional level of multiplexing of AUX and DDC signals delivering true flexibility and choice.\nA typical application of CBTL06DP213 is on motherboards where one of two GPU \nDisplayPort sources needs to be selected to  connect to a DisplayPort sink device or \nconnector. A controller chip sele cts which path to use by setting a select signal HIGH or \nLOW. Due to the bidirectional nature of the signal paths, CBTL06DP213 can also be used \nin the reverse topology, for example, to conne ct one display source device to one of two \ndisplay sink devices or connectors.\n2.

Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n12.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not \nsuitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n12.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n12.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhe sive and flux, clinching of leads, board \ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are \nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\nCBTL06DP213 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2017. All rights  reserved.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 4 — 23 March 2017 12 of 17NXP Semiconductors CBTL06DP213\nThird generation high-performance DisplayPort multiplexer\n12.4 Reflow soldering\nKey characteristics in reflow soldering are:\n•Lead-free versus SnPb solderi ng; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to \nhigher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 5 ) than a SnPb process, thus \nreducing the process window\n•Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process \nwindow for a mix of large and small components on one board\n•Reflow temperature profile; this profile includ es preheat, reflow (in which the board is \nheated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 14\n and 15\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 5 .Table 14.

#### Description:
The **CBTL06DP213** is a third-generation high-performance multi-channel multiplexer designed for DisplayPort (DP) v1.3 and Embedded DisplayPort applications. It operates at data rates of 1.62 Gbit/s, 2.7 Gbit/s, 5.4 Gbit/s, and 8.1 Gbit/s. The component utilizes NXP's proprietary high-bandwidth pass-gate technology, allowing for efficient switching and multiplexing of high-speed differential AC-coupled DP channels. It can switch/multiplex Hot Plug Detect (HPD) signals, Auxiliary (AUX), and Display Data Channel (DDC) signals, providing flexibility for various configurations.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Motherboards**: Selecting between two GPU DisplayPort sources to connect to a DisplayPort sink device or connector.
- **Docking Stations**: Facilitating connections between multiple display sources and sinks.
- **Notebook Computers**: Managing DisplayPort and PCI Express switching/multiplexing.
- **Chipsets**: Allowing flexible allocation of PCI Express or DisplayPort I/O pins to board connectors.

The CBTL06DP213 is particularly useful in scenarios where high-speed data transmission and signal integrity are critical, making it ideal for modern computing and display technologies.
