Operation beyond the maximum operating conditions for extended periods  may \naffect pr oduct reliability . \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE  \nθJA is specifie d for the worst -case conditions;  that is, θ JA is \nspec ified for a device soldered in the circuit board with its \nexposed paddle soldered to a pad on the PCB surface that is thermally connected to a copper plane, with zero airflow.  \nTable 4.  \nPackage Type  θJA θJC Unit  \nSingle 8-Lead SOIC_N_EP on a 4-Layer Board   47 29 °C/W  \nDual 8-Lead SOIC_N_EP on a 4-Layer Board  42 29 °C/W  \nMAXIMUM POWER DISSIP ATION  \nThe maximum safe power dissipation in the ADA4898 -1/ \nADA4898 -2 package  is limited by the associated rise in junction \ntemperature (T J) on the die. At approximately 150°C, which is \nthe glass transition temperature, the plastic changes its properties. \nEven temporarily exceeding this temperature limit can change \nthe stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently \nshifting the parametric performance of the ADA4898 -1/ \nADA4898 -2. Exceeding a junction temperature  of 150°C for an \nextended period can result in changes in the silicon devic es, \npotentially causing failure.  The power dissipated in the package (P D) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the package due to the output load drive. The quiescent power is the voltage between the supply pins (V\nS) times the quiescent \ncurrent (I S). The power dissipated due to the load drive depends \nupon the particular application. For each output, the power due to load drive is calculated by multiplying the load current by the \nassociated voltage drop across the devic e. RMS voltages and \ncurrents must be used in these calculations.  \nAirflow increases heat dissipation, effectively reducing θ\nJA. In \naddition, more metal directly in contact with the package leads \nfrom metal traces, through holes, ground, and power planes reduces the θ\nJA. The exposed paddle on the underside of the \npackage m ust be soldered to a pad on the PCB surface that is \nthermally connected to a copper plane to achieve the specified θ JA. \nFigure 4 shows the maximum power dissipation vs. the ambient \ntemperature for the single and dual 8-lead SOI C_N_EP on a \nJEDEC standard 4 -layer board, with its underside paddle \nsoldered to a pad that is thermally connected to a PCB plane. θ JA \nvalues are approximations.  \n00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.05.0\n4.5\n07037-003AMBIENT TEMPERATURE (°C)MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)\n0 20 40 60 80 100 10 30 50 70 90 –40 –20–30 –10ADA4898-2\nADA4898-1\n \nFigure 4.

They \nemploy  a highly linear input stage that can maintain greater \nthan −90 dBc ( at 2 V p-p) distortion out to 6 00 kHz while in a \nunity -gain conf iguration. This rare combination of unity  gain \nstability, low inp ut-referred noise , and extremely low distortion \nis the result of An alog Devices, Inc., proprietary op amp \narchitecture and high voltage  bipolar processing technology.  \nThe simplified ADA4898- 1/ADA4898- 2 topology, shown in \nFigure 44, is a single gain stage with a unity -gain output buffer. It \nhas over 100  dB of open -loop gain and maintains precision \nspecifications , such as CMRR, PSRR , and offset , to levels that are \nnormally associated  with topologies having two or more gain \nstages.  \nBUFFER gm\nCC R1 RLVOUT\n07037-041 \nFigure 44. Topology  PD (POWER -DOWN ) PIN FOR THE ADA4898 -1 \nThe PD pin saves power by decreasing the quiescent power \ndissipated in the device. It is very useful when power is an issue \nand the device does not need to be turned on at all times . The \nresponse of the device is rapid when going from power -down \nmode to full power operation mode. Note that PD does not put  \nthe output in a high- Z state, which means that the ADA4898 -1/ \nADA4898 -2 are not recommended for use as  multiplexer s. \nLeaving the PD pin floating keeps the amplifier in full power \noperation mode . \nTable 7.

The onl y exception is the feedback capacitor in \nparallel with the feedback re sistor, R F, but this capacitor is \nrecommended only when using a large R F value (>300 Ω). \nFigure 46 shows the difference between using a 100 Ω resistor \nand a 1 kΩ feedback resistor. Due to the high input capacitance in \nthe ADA 4898- 1/ADA4898- 2 when using  a higher feedback \nresistor, more peaking appears in the closed -loop gain. Using \nthe lower feedback resistor resolves this issue; however, when \nrunning at  higher supplies (±15 V) with an R F of 100 Ω, the \nsystem draws a lot of extra current into the feedback network. \nTo avoid this problem, a higher feedback resistor can be used \nwith a feedback capacitor in parallel. Figure 46 shows the effect of \nplacing a feedback capacitor in parallel with a larger R F. In this \ngain -of-2 configuration, R F = R G = 1 kΩ and C F = 2.7 pF. When \nusing C F, the peaking drops from 6 dB to less than  2 dB.  \n07037-043VINVOUT10µF+VS\n–VSRTRL\n+\n10µF+CF\nRF RF\n0.1µF\n0.1µF\n \nFigure 45.

To simplify the noise calculations, noise spectral densities \nwere used rather than a ctual voltages to leave bandwidth  out of the \nexpressions. Noise spectral density, which is generally expressed \nin nV/√Hz, is equivalent to the noise in a 1 Hz bandwidth.  \nThe noise model shown in Figure 47 has six individual noise \nsources: the Johnson noise of the three resistors, the op amp \nvoltage noise , and the current noise in each input of the amplifier. \nEach noise source has its own contribution to the noise at the \noutput. Noise is generally specified as referr ing to inp ut (RTI), \nbut it is often simpler to calculate the noise referred to the output (RTO) and then divide by the noise gain to obtain the RTI \nnoise.  \nGAIN FROM\nB TO OUTPUT= –R2\n      R1GAIN FROM\nA TO OUTPUT=\nNOISE GAIN =\nNG = 1 +R2\n                R1IN–\nVNVN, R1\nVN, R3R1R2\nIN+R34kTR2\n4kTR1\n4kTR3VN, R2\nB\nA\nVN2 + 4kTR3 + 4kTR1      R22\nR1 + R2\nIN+2R32 + IN–2R1 × R22\n + 4kTR2R12\n R1 + R2 R1 + R2RTI NOISE =\nRTO NOISE = NG × RTI NOISEVOUT\n+\n07037-045 \nFigure 47. Op Amp Noise Analysis Model \nAll resistors have a Johnson noise that is c alculated by  \n) (4kBTR  \nwhere:  \nk is Boltzmann’s c onstant (1.38 × 10−23 J/K).  \nB is the bandwidth in Hertz.  \nT is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.  \nR is the resistance in ohms.  \nA simple relationship that is easy to remember is that a 50 Ω resistor generates a Johnson noise of 1  nV/√ Hz at 25°C.  \nIn applications where noise sensitivity is critical, care must be taken not to introduce other significant noise sources to the amplifier. Each resistor is a noise source. Attention to the following are as is critical to maintain low noise performance: \ndesign, layout, and component selection. A summary of noise \nperformance for the amplifier and associated resistors is shown  \nin Table 8. CIRCUIT CONSIDERATIO NS \nCareful and delib erate attention to detail when laying out the \nADA4898- 1/ADA4898- 2 board s yields optimal performance. \nPower s upply bypassing, parasitic capacitance, and component \nselection all contribute to the overall performance of the amplifier.  \nPCB LAYOUT \nBecause the ADA4898- 1/ADA4898- 2 have  small signal \nbandwidth s of 65 MHz, i t is essential that high frequency  board \nlayout techniques be employed. All ground and power planes \nunder the pins of the ADA4898- 1/ADA4898- 2 should be cleared \nof copper to prevent the formation of parasitic  capacitance between \nthe input pins to ground and the ou tput pins to ground. A single \nmounting pad on a SOIC footprint can add as much as 0.2  pF of \ncapaci tance to ground if the ground plane is not cleared from \nunder the mounting pads.  \nPOWER SUPPLY BYPASSI NG \nPower supply bypassing for the ADA4898- 1/ADA4898- 2 has \nbeen optimized for frequency response and distortion \nperformance. Figure 45 shows the recommended values and \nlocation of the bypass capacitors. Power supply bypassing is \ncritical for stability,  frequency response, distortion, and PSR \nperformance. The 0.1  µF capacitors shown in Figure 45 should be \nas close to the supply pins of the ADA4898- 1/ADA4898- 2 as \npossible. The 10 µF electrolytic capac itors should be adjacent to , \nbut not necessar ily close to , the 0.1 µF capacitors. The capacitor \nbetween the two supplies helps improve PSR and distortion performance. In some cases, additional  paralleled capacitors can \nhelp improve frequency and transient response.  \nGROUND ING  \nGround and power planes should be used where possible. Ground  \nand power planes reduce the resistance and inductance of the power planes and ground returns. The returns for the input  \nand output terminations, bypass capacitors, and R\nG should all \nbe kept  as close to the ADA4898- 1/ADA4898- 2 as possible. The \noutput load ground and the bypass capacitor grounds sh ould be \nreturned to the same point on the ground plane to minimize parasitic trace inductance, ringing, and overshoot and to improve distortion performance.  \nThe ADA4898- 1/ADA4898 -2 package features an exposed paddle. \nFor optimum electrical and thermal performance, solder this paddle to a negative supply plane.  \n \n \n \nRev.
