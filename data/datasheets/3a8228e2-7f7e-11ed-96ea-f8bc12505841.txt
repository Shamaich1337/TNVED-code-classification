The regulated output voltage specification will not apply for\nall possible combinations of input voltage and output current. Whenoperating at maximum input voltage, the output current range must be\nlimited. When operating at maximum output current, the input voltage\nrange must be limited.\nNote 5:  The LTC1844’s high precision degrades slightly at high\ntemperatures (T\nJ > 70 °C) with input voltages below 2.2V. The lower output\nvoltage versions have been split into higher and lower accuracy input\nvoltage ranges to reflect this.Note 6:  To ensure adequate input supply voltage, the LTC1844 adjustable\nversions are tested and specified for these conditions with an external\nresistor divider (two 100k resistors) for an output voltage of 2.50V. Theexternal resistor divider will add a 5 µA load on the output.\nNote 7:  Dropout voltage is (V\nIN – V OUT) when V OUT falls to 100mV below\nits nominal value measured at V IN = V OUT + 0.5V. For example, the\nLTC1844-3.3 is tested by measuring the V OUT at V IN = 3.8V, then V IN is\nlowered until V OUT falls 100mV below the measured value. The difference\n(VIN – V OUT) is then measured and defined as ∆VDO.\nNote 8:  ADJ pin bias current flows into the ADJ pin.\nNote 9:  Output reverse leakage current is tested with the IN pin grounded\nand the OUT pin forced to the rated output voltage.\nNote 10:  This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended to\nprotect the device during momentary overload conditions. Junction\ntemperature will exceed 125 °C when overtemperature protection is active.\nContinuous operation above the specified maximum operating junctiontemperature may impair device reliability.\n5LTC1844 Series\n 1844faTYPICAL PERFOR   A  CE CHARACTERISTICS  UW\nVOUT vs Temperature\nTEMPERATURE ( °C)–50VOUT (V)1.515\n25\n1844 G011.500\n1.490\n–25 0 501.485\n1.4801.520\n1.510\n1.505\n1.495\n75 100 125VOUT = 1.5V\nTEMPERATURE ( °C)–50VOUT (V)1.815\n25\n1844 G021.800\n1.790\n–25 0 501.785\n1.7801.820\n1.810\n1.805\n1.795\n75 100 125VOUT = 1.8V\nTEMPERATURE ( °C)–50VOUT (V)2.515\n25\n1844 G032.500\n2.490\n–25 0 502.485\n2.4802.520\n2.510\n2.505\n2.495\n75 100 125VOUT = 2.5VVOUT vs Temperature V OUT vs Temperature\nVOUT vs Temperature V OUT vs Temperature V OUT vs Temperature\nTEMPERATURE ( °C)–50VOUT (V)2.815\n25\n1844 G042.800\n2.790\n–25 0 502.785\n2.7802.820\n2.810\n2.805\n2.795\n75 100 125VOUT = 2.8V\nTEMPERATURE ( °C)–50VOUT (V)3.315\n25\n1844 G053.300\n3.290\n–25 0 503.285\n3.2803.320\n3.310\n3.305\n3.295\n75 100 125VOUT = 3.3V\nTEMPERATURE ( °C)–50VOUT (V)1.265\n25\n1844 G051.250\n1.240\n–25 0 501.235\n1.2301.270\n1.260\n1.255\n1.245\n75 100 125VOUT = ADJ\nQuiescent Current vs Temperature Current Limit vs Temperature SHDN Threshold vs Temperature\nTEMPERATURE ( °C)–50405070\n25 75\n1844 G0730\n20\n–25 0 50 100 12510\n060IQ (µA)\nTEMPERATURE ( °C)–50CURRENT LIMIT (mA)400450500\n25 75\n1844 G08350\n300\n–25 0 50 100 125250\n200VOUT = 2.8V\nTEMPERATURE ( °C)–50SHDN THRESHOLD (mV)750\n25\n1844 G09600\n500\n–25 0 50450\n400800\n700\n650\n550\n75 100 125ILOAD  = 1mA\n6LTC1844 Series\n 1844faIN (Pin 1):  Power for LTC1844 and Load. Power is supplied\nto the device through the IN pin. The IN pin should be\nlocally bypassed to ground if the LTC1844 is more than a\nfew inches away from another source of bulk capacitance.\nIn general, the output impedance of a battery rises withfrequency, so it is usually advisable to include an input\nbypass capacitor in battery-powered circuits. A capacitor\nin the range of 0.1 µF to 1 µF is usually sufficient. The\nLTC1844 is designed to withstand reverse voltages on the\nIN pin with respect to both ground and the output pin. In\nthe case of a reversed input, which can happen if a batteryis plugged in backwards, the LTC1844 will act as if there\nis a large resistor in series with its input and only a small\namount of current will flow.\nGND (Pin 2):  Ground and Heat Sink. Solder to a ground\nplane or large pad to maximize heat dissipation.SHDN (Pin 3, Fixed and SD Devices): Shutdown, Active\nLow. This pin is used to put the LTC1844 into shutdown.\nThe SHDN pin current is typically less than 10nA. The\nSHDN pin cannot be left floating and must be tied to theinput pin if not used. If reverse-battery protection is\ndesired, the SHDN pin must be tied to the input pin through\na large value resistor (10k  to 1M).\nUU UPI   FU  CTIO  S\nADJ (Pin 4, Adjustable Devices):  Output Adjust. For the\nadjustable versions of the LTC1844, this is the input to theerror amplifier. It has a typical bias current of 30nA flowing\ninto the pin. The ADJ pin reference voltage is 1.25V\nreferenced to ground. The output voltage range is 1.25V to6V and is typically set by connecting ADJ to a resistor\ndivider from OUT to GND. See Figure 2.\nBYP (Pin 4, Fixed/Pin 3, BYP Devices):  Noise Bypass.\nThe BYP pin is used to augment the internal noise filter to\nimprove low noise performance. A small low leakage\nbypass capacitor from this pin to ground will filter the inputof the error amplifier to lower the output voltage noise.\nAny value may be used; larger values will result in lower\noutput noise, but will increase initial power-up time.Shutdown exit delay time after a brief shutdown (<10ms)\nwill not be affected. If not used, this pin must be left\nunconnected.\nOUT (Pin 5):  Voltage Regulated Output. The OUT pin\nsupplies power to the load. A minimum output capacitor of\n1µF is required to ensure stability. Larger output capacitors\nmay be required for applications with large transient loads\nto limit peak voltage transients.

The devices are capable of supplying\n150mA at a dropout voltage of 90mV (LTC1844-3.3, seeElectrical Characteristics for dropout voltage of other\nversions). Output voltage noise is as low as 30 µV\nRMS over\na 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth with the addition of a 0.1 µF\nbypass capacitor. The low operating quiescent current(35 µA) drops to 10nA in shutdown.\nIn addition to the low quiescent current, the LTC1844\nregulators incorporate several protection features which\nmake them ideal for use in battery-powered systems. The\ndevices are protected against both reverse input voltagesand reverse voltages from output to input (reverse current\nprotection). The devices also include current limit and\nthermal overload protection, and will survive an outputshort circuit indefinitely. The fast transient response over-\ncomes the traditional tradeoff between dropout voltage,\nquiescent current and load transient response inherent inmost regulators by using a proprietary new architecture\n(see Figure 1).Adjustable Operation\nThe adjustable version of the LTC1844 has an output\nvoltage range of 1.25V to 6V. The output voltage is set bythe ratio of two external resistors as shown in Figure 2. The\ndevice servos the output to maintain the ADJ pin voltage\nat 1.25V (referenced to ground). The current in R1 is thenequal to 1.25V/R1 and the current in R2 is the current in R1\nplus the ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ pin bias current,\n30nA at 25 °C, flows through R2 into the ADJ pin. The\noutput voltage can be calculated using the formula in\nFigure 2. The value of R1 should be no greater than 1M Ω\nto minimize errors in the output voltage caused by the ADJ\npin bias current. Note that in shutdown the output is turned\noff and the divider current will be zero once C\nOUT is\ndischarged.\nAdjustable devices are tested and specified with the ADJ\npin tied to the OUT pin for an output voltage of 1.25V.\nSpecifications for output voltages greater than 1.25V will\nbe proportional to the ratio of the desired output voltage to1.25V: V\nOUT/1.25V. For example, load regulation for an\nFigure 2.

At V OUT = 5V, load regulation is:\n(5V/1.25V)(–4mV) = –16mV\nBecause the ADJ pin is relatively high impedance (depend-\ning on the resistor divider used), stray capacitance at this\npin can introduce significant phase shift in the error\namplifier loop. The PCB layout should be designed toabsolutely minimize the capacitance seen at the ADJ pin.\nTo ensure stability over all operating conditions when\nutilizing large divider resistors, a small feedforward ca-pacitor (≈1000pF) in parallel with the upper divider resis-\ntor (C\nFF in Figure 2) is recommended. As an added bonus,\nthis capacitor will improve transient response.\nBypass Capacitance and Low Noise Performance\nA bypass capacitor can optionally be connected from the\nBYP pin to ground to lower output voltage noise. A good\nquality low leakage capacitor is recommended. This ca-\npacitor will bypass the input of the error amplifier, provid-\ning a low frequency noise pole. The noise pole provided by\nthis bypass capacitor will lower the output voltage noise to\nas low as 30 µVRMS with the addition of a 0.1 µF capacitor.\nInitial regulator power-up time is inversely proportional tothe size of the bypass capacitor, slowing to 10ms with a\n0.1 µF bypass capacitor and 10 µF output capacitor. How-\never, the LTC1844 does not discharge the bypass capaci-tor when put into shutdown and thus the shutdown exitdelay can be much shorter ( ≈70 µs) than initial power-up\ntime if the shutdown duration is brief (<10ms). The\nmaximum shutdown duration required to allow fast shut-\ndown exit is determined by the capacitor leakage current,\nthus a low leakage bypass capacitor is recommended.\nOutput Capacitance and Transient Response\nThe LTC1844 regulators are designed to be stable with a\nwide range of output capacitors. The ESR of the output\ncapacitor affects stability, most notably with small capaci-\ntors. A minimum output capacitor of 1 µF with an ESR of\n0.3Ω or less is recommended to ensure stability. The\nLTC1844 is a micropower device and output transient\nresponse will be a function of output capacitance. Larger\nvalues of output capacitance decrease the peak deviations\nand provide improved transient response for larger load\ncurrent changes. Note that bypass capacitors used to\ndecouple individual components powered by the LTC1844\nwill increase the effective output capacitor value. The\nshaded region of Figure 3 defines the region over which\nthe LTC1844 regulators are stable. The maximum ESR\nallowed is 0.3 Ω. High ESR tantalum and electrolytic ca-\npacitors may be used, but a low ESR ceramic capacitormust be in parallel at the output. There is no minimum ESR\nrequirement.\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic\ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a\nvariety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across\nFigure 3.

The most common di-\nelectrics used are Z5U, Y5V, X5R and X7R. The Z5U and\nY5V dielectrics are good for providing high capacitances\nin a small package, but exhibit strong voltage and tem-\nperature coefficients as shown in Figures 4 and 5. When\nused with a 5V regulator, a 10 µF Y5V capacitor can exhibit\nan effective value as low as 1 µF to 2 µF over the operating\ntemperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in\nmore stable characteristics and are more suitable for use\nas the output capacitor. The X7R type has better stability\nacross temperature, while the X5R is less expensive and\nis available in higher values.Additionally, some ceramic capacitors have a piezoelectricresponse. A piezoelectric device generates voltage across\nits terminals due to mechanical stress, similar to the way\na piezoelectric accelerometer or microphone works. For a\nceramic capacitor the stress can be induced by vibrations\nin the system or thermal transients. The resulting voltages\nproduced can cause appreciable amounts of noise, espe-cially when a ceramic capacitor is used for noise bypass-\ning. A ceramic capacitor produced Figure 6’s trace in\nresponse to light tapping from a pencil. Similar vibration-induced behavior can masquerade as increased output\nvoltage noise.\nFigure 4.

This behavior occurs when the input supply slew rate\nis greater than 1V/ms and the output bypass capacitor is\nsmall. If the input is expected to slew rapidly, an outputbypass capacitor of 10 µF or greater should be used to\nminimize output overshoot. Note that overshoot typicallydoes not occur at start-up since the feedback loop doesnot spend a significant amount of time in dropout.\n10LTC1844 Series\n 1844faThermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device will be limited\nby the maximum rated junction temperature (125 °C). The\npower dissipated by the device will be the output current\nmultiplied by the input/output voltage differential:\n(IOUT)(VIN – V OUT).\nThe LTC1844 series regulators have internal thermal lim-\niting designed to protect the device during momentary\noverload conditions. For continuous normal conditions,\nthe maximum junction temperature rating of 125 °C must\nnot be exceeded. It is important to give careful consider-\nation to all sources of thermal resistance from junction to\nambient. Additional heat sources mounted nearby mustalso be considered.\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished\nby using the heat-spreading capabilities of the PC board\nand its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and platedthrough holes can also be used to spread the heat gener-\nated by power devices.\nTable 1 lists thermal resistance for several different board\nsizes and copper areas. All measurements were taken in\nstill air on 3/32" FR-4 board with one ounce copper.\nTable 1.

The thermal resistance will be in\nthe range of 125 °C/W to 150 °C/W depending on the\ncopper area. The junction temperature rise above ambientwill be approximately equal to:\n0.135W(150 °C/W) = 20.3 °C\nThe maximum junction temperature will then be equal tothe maximum junction temperature rise above ambientplus the maximum ambient temperature or:\nT = 50 °C + 20.3 °C = 70.3 °C\nProtection Features\nThe LTC1844 regulators incorporate several protection\nfeatures which make them ideal for use in battery-powered\ncircuits. In addition to the usual protection features asso-ciated with monolithic regulators, such as current limiting\nand thermal limiting, the devices are protected against\nreverse input voltages and reverse voltages from output toinput.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection\nare intended to protect the device against current overloadconditions at the output of the device. For normal opera-\ntion, the junction temperature should not exceed 125 °C.\nThe input of the device will withstand input voltages of\n– 7V. Current flow into the device will be limited to less\nthan 500 µA (typically less than 200 µA) and only a small\nnegative voltage will appear at the output (~ –300mV with\nno load). The LTC1844 will protect both itself and the load\nagainst batteries plugged in backward. The shutdown pin\nwill require current limiting if used (see Pin Functions).APPLICATIO NS INFORMATIONWU U U\n11LTC1844 Series\n 1844faIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several\ndifferent input/output conditions can occur. The output\nvoltage may be held up externally while the input is either\npulled to ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage orleft open circuit. The LTC1844 features reverse current\nprotection to limit current draw from any supplementary\npower source at the output. When V\nIN is pulled to ground\nor is left open circuit, I IN and I OUT are less than 0.1 µA for\nVOUT = 0V to 7V.\nWhen V IN is held constant and V OUT varied, current flow\nwill follow the curves shown in Figure 7. With V OUT held\nbelow V OUT(NOM) , the LTC1844 will be in current limittrying to pull V OUT up. With V OUT held between V OUT(NOM)\nand V IN, IIN will be at the normal quiescent current level\nand I OUT will be 1 µA to 2 µA. As V OUT is pulled above V IN,\nIOUT temporarily increases to 30 µA until the reverse cur-\nrent protection circuitry activates and reduces I OUT to less\nthan 10 µA.\nAlternatively, when V OUT is held constant and V IN varied,\ncurrent flow will follow Figure 8’s curves. I OUT will be less\nthan 10 µA at all times except for a brief spike just below\n2.7V before the reverse current protection circuitryactivates.APPLICATIO NS INFORMATIONWU U U\nFigure 7.
