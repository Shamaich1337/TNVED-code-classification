It is optimized \nto amplify small differential voltages in the presence of large \ncommon-mode signals. \nThe AD8420 is based on an indirect current feedback architecture \nthat gives it an excellent input common-mode range. Unlike \nconventional instrumentation amplifiers, the AD8420 can easily \namplify signals at or even slightly below ground without requiring \ndual supplies. The AD8420 has rail-to-rail output, and the output \nvoltage swing is completely independent of the input common-\nmode voltage. Single-supply operation, micropower current consumption, and \nrail-to-rail output swing make the AD8420 ideal for battery-\npowered applications. Its rail-to-rail output stage maximizes dynamic range when operating from low supply voltages. Dual-supply operation (±15 V) and low power consumption make the AD8420 ideal for a wide variety of applications in medical \nor industrial instrumentation. \nThe AD8420 is available in an 8-lead MSOP package. Performance \nis specified over the full temperature range of −40°C to +85°C, \nand the device is operational from −40°C to +125°C. \n \nAD8420 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Simplified Schematic \nARCHITECTURE \nThe AD8420 is based on an indirect current feedback topology \nconsisting of three amplifiers: two matched transconductance \namplifiers that convert voltage to current and one integrator amplifier that converts current to voltage. \nFor the AD8420 , assume that all initial voltages and currents are \nzero until a positive differential voltage is applied between the \ninputs, +IN and −IN. Transconductance Amplifier g\nm1 converts this \ninput voltage into a current, I1. Because the voltage across g m2 is \ninitially zero, I2 is zero and I3 equals I1. \nI3 is integrated to the output, making the output voltage, V OUT, \nincrease. This voltage continues to increase until the same differ-\nential input voltage across the inputs of g m1 is replicated across \nthe inputs of g m2, generating a current (I2) equal to I1. This reduces \nthe Difference Current I3 to zero so that the output remains at a stable voltage. The gain in the configuration shown in Figure 58 is \nset by R2 and R1. \nIn traditional instrumentation amplifiers, the input common-\nmode voltage can limit the available output swing, typically depicted in a hexagon plot. Because the AD8420 converts the \ninput differential signals to current, this limit does not apply. This \nis particularly important when amplifying a signal with a common-\nmode voltage near one of the supply rails. \nTo improve robustness and ease of use, the AD8420 includes \ndifferential voltage protection to limit the current into its inputs \nto a safe level. This protection scheme allows wide differential \ninput voltages without damaging the device. \nSETTING THE GAIN \nThe transfer function of the AD8420 is \nVOUT = G(V+IN − V−IN) + V REF \nwhere R1R2G\uf02b \uf03d1 . \n \n   Table 7.

Larger values reduce power \nconsumption and output loading; smaller values limit the FB input bias current and offset current error. For best output swing and distortion performance, keep (R1 + R2) || R\nL ≥ 20 kΩ. \nA method that allows large value feedback resistors while limiting \nFB bias current error is to place a resistor of value R1 || R2 in \nseries with the REF terminal, as shown in Figure 59.

A | Page 20 of 26 GAIN ACCURACY \nUnlike most instrumentation amplifiers, the relative match of \nthe two gain setting resistors determines the gain accuracy of \nthe AD8420 rather than a single resistor. For example, if two \nresistors have exactly the same absolute error, there is no error \nin gain. Conversely, two 1% resistors can cause approximately 2% \nmaximum gain error at high gains. Temperature coefficient mismatch of the gain setting resistors increases the gain drift of the instrumentation amplifier circuit, according to the gain equation. Because these external resistors do not have to match any on-chip resistors, resistors with good TC tracking can \nachieve excellent gain drift. Even with standard thin film \nresistors, the AD8420 can still achieve better gain drift than \nmost instrumentation amplifiers. \nWhen the differential voltage at the inputs approaches the \ndifferential input limit, the diodes start to conduct, limiting the voltage seen by the inputs of amplifier g\nm1. This can look like \nincreased gain error at large differential inputs. Performance of the \nAD8420 is specified for ±1 V differential from −40°C to +85°C. \nHowever, at higher temperatures, the reduced forward voltage of the diodes limits the differential input to a smaller voltage. Figure 60 tracks 1% error across the operating temperature \nrange to show the effect of temperature on the input limit. \n–40 –25 –10 5 20 35 50 65 80 95 110 125MAXIMUM INPUT VOLTAGE (1% ERROR)\nTEMPERATURE (°C)\n09945-50302.0\n1.81.61.4\n1.2\n1.00.80.60.4\n0.2POSITIVE VOLTAGENEGATIVE VOLTAGE V S = ±15V\n \nFigure 60. Differential Input Limit vs. Temperature  \nINPUT VOLTAGE RANGE \nThe allowed input range of the AD8420 is much simpler than \ntraditional architectures. For the transfer function of the AD8420 \nto be valid, the input voltage should follow two rules: \n\uf0b7 Keep the differential input voltage within ±1 V . \n\uf0b7 Keep the voltage on the +IN, −IN, REF , and FB pins in the \nspecified input voltage range. \nBecause the output swing is completely independent of the input common-mode voltage, there are no hexagonal figures or complicated formulas to follow, and no limitation for the \noutput swing the amplifier has for input signals with changing \ncommon mode. \n INPUT PROTECTION  \nThe current into the AD8420 inputs is limited internally. This \nensures that the diodes that limit the differential voltage seen by \nthe internal amplifier do not draw excessive current when they turn on. The device can handle large differential input voltages, \nregardless of the amount of gain applied, without damage. As a \nresult, the AD8420 inputs are protected from voltages beyond the positive rail. If voltages beyond the negative rail are expected, \nexternal protection must be used. \nKeep all of the AD8420  terminals within the voltage range specified \nin the Absolute Maximum Ratings section. All terminals of the \nAD8420 are protected against ESD. \nInput Voltages Beyond the Rails \nFor applications that require protection beyond the negative rail, \none option is to use an external resistor in series with each input \nto limit current during overload conditions. In this case, size the \nresistors to limit the current into the AD8420 to 6 mA. \nRPROTECT  ≥ (Negative Supply  − VIN)/6 mA \nAlthough the AD8420 inputs must still be kept within the −V S + \n40 V limitation, the I × R drop across the protection resistor \nincreases the protection on the positive side to approximately \n(40 V + Negative Supply ) + 300 μA × RPROTECT  \nAn alternate protection method is to place diodes at the AD8420  \ninputs to limit voltage and resistors in series with the inputs to limit the current into these diodes. To keep input bias current at a minimum for normal operation, use low leakage diode clamps, such as the BAV199. The AD8420  also combines well with TVS \ndiodes, such as the PTVSxS1UR. \nSIMPLE METHOD ALTERNATE METHODAD8420RPROTECT\nRPROTECTRPROTECT\nRPROTECTVIN++\n–\nVIN–VIN+\nVIN–+\n–+VS\nAD8420\n–VS+VS\n–VS+VS\n–VS+VS\n–VSI +\n–\n+\n–\n09945-160 \nFigure 61. Protection for Voltages Beyond the Rails \nLarge Differential Input Voltage \nThe AD8420 is able to handle large differential input voltage \nwithout damage to the device. Refer to Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11, and Figure 12 for overvoltage performance. The AD8420 differential voltage is internally limited with diodes to ±1 V . If this limit is exceeded, the diodes start to conduct and \ndraw current, as shown in Figure 22. This current is limited \ninternally to a value that is safe for the AD8420, but if the input \ncurrent cannot be tolerated in the system, place resistors in \nseries with each input with the following value: \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf02d\uf0b3\nMAXDIFF\nPROTECTIVRV 1\n21 \nData Sheet AD8420\n \nRev. A | Page 21 of 26 LAYOUT \nCommon-Mode Rejection Ratio over Frequency \nPoor layout can cause some of the common-mode signal to be \nconverted to a differential signal before reaching the in-amp. This \nconversion can occur when the path to the positive input pin has a different frequency response than the path to the negative input pin. For best CMRR vs. frequency performance, the input \nsource impedance and capacitance of each path should be closely \nmatched. This includes connecting Pin 1 to −V\nS, which matches the \nparasitic capacitance and the leakage between the inputs and adjacent pins. Place additional source resistance in the input path (for example, for input protection) close to the in-amp inputs to minimize their interaction with the parasitic capacitance from the printed circuit board (PCB) traces. \nPower Supplies \nUse a stable dc voltage to power the instrumentation amplifier. \nNoise on the supply pins can adversely affect performance. For \nmore information, see the PSRR performance curves in Figure 24 and Figure 25. \nPlace a 0.1 μF capacitor as close as possible to each supply pin. \nAs shown in Figure 62, a 10 μF tantalum capacitor can be used \nfarther away from the device. This capacitor, which is intended to be effective at low frequencies, can usually be shared by other precision integrated circuits. Keep the traces between these integrated circuits short to minimize interaction of the trace parasitic inductance with the shared capacitor. \nR1 R2AD8420+VS\n+IN\n–IN0.1µF 10µF\n0.1µF 10µF\n–VSVOUT\n09945-060 \nFigure 62. Supply Decoupling, REF, and Output Referred to Local Ground Reference \nThe output voltage of the AD8420 is developed with respect to \nthe potential on the reference terminal.

The differential voltage at the inputs is \nreproduced between the REF and FB pins; therefore, it is important \nto set V REF so that the voltage at FB does not exceed the input range. \nDRIVING THE REFERENCE PIN \nTraditional instrumentation amplifier architectures require the \nreference pin to be driven with a low impedance source. In these \narchitectures, impedance at the reference pin degrades both CMRR and gain accuracy.

If more output current is required, buffer the AD8420 output with a precision op amp. Figure 67 shows \nthe recommended configuration using the ADA4692-2  with a \nsingle supply. This low power op amp can swing its output from 1 V to 4 V on a single 5 V supply while sourcing or sinking more than 30 mA of current. When using this configuration, \nthe load seen by the AD8420 is approximately R1 + R2. \nR1 R2+5V\n–VS+VS\n–VS+VS0.1µF\nVOUT0.1µF\nADA4692-2VIN AD8420\nVREF\n09945-065 \nFigure 67. Output Buffering Because the ADA4692-2  is a dual op amp, another op amp is now \nfree for use as an active filter stage or to buffer another AD8420 \noutput on the same PCB.

In this circuit, the voltage \nfrom the wiper of a potentiometer is buffered by the ADA4692-2 , \nallowing a variable level shift of the output. Resistors above and \nbelow the potentiometer reduce the total range of the level shift but increase the precision. If the potentiometer were connected directly to the REF pin of the AD8420, gain error would be intro-\nduced from the variable resistance. The potentiometer can be tuned in hardware or software, depending on the type of potentiometer chosen.

A | Page 24 of 26 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nAD8420 IN ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY (ECG) \nA high-pass filter is commonly used in ECG signal conditioning \ncircuitry to remove electrode offset and motion artifacts. To avoid \ndegrading the input impedance and CMRR of the system, this filtering is typically implemented after the instrumentation \namplifier, which limits the gain that can be applied with the \ninstrumentation amplifier. \nWith a 3-op-amp instrumentation amplifier, gain is applied in the \nfirst stage. Because of this, the electrode offset is gained and then must be removed afterward with a high-pass filter. In the AD8420 \narchitecture, the offset can be accounted for in the input stage by unbalancing the transconductance amplifier at the REF and FB pins. In the steady state, the offset at the input is not gained to the output, and higher frequency signals can be gained and passed through. Using the AD8420 in this way, the offset tolerance \nis nearly the differential input range of the device (±1 V). \nFigure 69 shows an ECG front end that applies a gain of 100 to \nthe signal while rejecting dc and high frequencies. This circuit \ncombines the AD8420 with the AD8657, which is a low power, \nlow cost, dual, precision CMOS op amp. \n \n \n–5V\n8200pF\n10MΩINSTRUMENTATION\nAMPLIFIER\nG = +100\nAD8420+5V\n–5V+5V3.3μFAB\nC\n09945-072402kΩ200pF\n200pF2000pF\n100kΩ100kΩ\n+5V\n–5V\nAD8657-2 AD8657-1REFFB 100kΩ\n1kΩ200kΩ\n200kΩ0.015μFTHREE-POLE LPF,\nBESSEL RESPONSE\nFC = 50Hz\nINTEGRATOR PROVIDES\nHIGH-PASS POLE AT 0.5Hz110kΩ\n0.022μF500kΩ\n \nFigure 69.

A | Page 25 of 26 CLASSIC BRIDGE CIRCUIT \nFigure 70 shows the AD8420 configured to amplify the signal from \na classic resistive bridge. This circuit works in dual-supply mode or \nsingle-supply mode. Typically, the same voltage that powers the instrumentation amplifier excites the bridge. Connecting the \nbottom of the bridge to the negative supply of the instrumentation \namplifier sets up an input common-mode voltage that is located midway between the supply voltages. The voltage on the REF pin can be varied to suit the application. For example, the REF pin is tied to the V\nREF pin of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) \nwhose input range is (V REF ± V IN). With an available output swing \non the AD8420 of (−V S + 100 mV) to (+V S − 150 mV), the \nmaximum programmable gain is simply this output range divided \nby the input range. \n+VS\n–VS0.1µF\n0.1µFVOUT\nVREFVDIFF AD8420\n09945-069 \nFigure 70. Classic Bridge Circuit 4 mA TO 20 mA SINGLE-SUPPLY RECEIVER \nThe 90 μA maximum supply current, input range that goes \nbelow ground, and low drift characteristics make the AD8420 a \nvery good candidate for use in a 4 mA to 20 mA loop. Figure 71 \nshows how a signal from a 4 mA to 20 mA transducer can be \ninterfaced to the AD8420. The signal from a 4 mA to 20 mA \ntransducer is single-ended, which initially suggests the need for \na simple shunt resistor to ground to convert the current to a voltage. However, any line resistance in the return path (to the transducer) adds a current-dependent offset error; therefore, the current must \nbe sensed differentially. \nIn this example, a 5 Ω shunt resistor generates a differential voltage \nat the inputs of the AD8420 between 20 mV (for 4 mA in) and \n100 mV (for 20 mA in) with a very low common-mode value. With the gain resistors shown, the AD8420 amplifies the 100 mV \ninput voltage by a factor of 40 to 4.0 V . \n \n09945-073AD627LINE\nIMPEDANCE4mA TO 20mA 5 Ω4mA TO 20mA\nTRANSDUCER\nR2 = 97.6k Ω\nR1 = 2.49k Ω0.1µF5V\nAD8420\nR2 R1G = 40\nPOWER\nSUPPLY+ –+–\n0.8V TO 4.0V\n \nFigure 71. 4 mA to 20 mA Receiver Circuit \n \nAD8420 Data Sheet\nRev.
